00:00:19.438\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and in today's\nepisode we're gonna be talking about\n\n4\n00:00:19.438 --> 00:00:23.660\nOS X Server and joining us in the studio\ntoday is none other Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.990\nDon, how are you doing today sir?\n\n6\n00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.920\n>> I'm doing great Wes.\n\n7\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.490\nWe need to dive in OS X sir.\n\n8\n00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.910\nI know I'm excited about\nthis episode because if\n\n9\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.650\nyou've been watching our previous\nAC Ace certification content and ACSP.\n\n10\n00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.430\nWe keep kinda doubling in\nserver just a little bit.\n\n11\n00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.150\nWe see a little bit and then back away.\n\n12\n00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.580\nWe see a little bit back away.\n\n13\n00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.640\nWell in this series we don't back away\nwe're gonna dive right in the server.\n\n14\n00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.270\nWe're gonna see how to get it installed\nand all the configurations on it.\n\n15\n00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.140\nI'm excited about it and\n\n16\n00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.030\nreally the best place to kick this\nthing off is getting it installed.\n\n17\n00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.850\nAnd so that's what we're\ngonna look at right here.\n\n18\n00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.408\nI wanna talk about how to install\nOS X Server, which is super easy.\n\n19\n00:00:57.408 --> 00:00:59.500\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nhow to upgrade OS10,\n\n20\n00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.450\nwhich coincidentally also super easy.\n\n21\n00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.800\nSo super easy stuff for us, but there's a\nlot of things that we need to be aware of\n\n22\n00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.580\nbefore we do the install and things that\nwe need to be aware of for the exams.\n\n23\n00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.240\nThat's where we're going\nto kick things off.\n\n24\n00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.050\n>> Now Don, one of the things we've\nseen past in other episodes and\n\n25\n00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.310\nreally in other series, is that when\nyou go to install an operating system,\n\n26\n00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.879\nthere are a certain set of\nrequirements that you have to meet.\n\n27\n00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.580\nOS 10 server it's not really\ngonna be much different right?\n\n28\n00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.280\nWe do have to figure\nwhat hardware we have,\n\n29\n00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.830\nbefore we just try to slap\nthis operating system.\n\n30\n00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.840\nSo I imagine this is where\nwe are at today too?\n\n31\n00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.107\n>> Right.\n\n32\n00:01:32.107 --> 00:01:35.795\nIf you are new to the Apple world this\nkind of a big thing that sets them apart\n\n33\n00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:36.880\nfrom other vendors.\n\n34\n00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.320\nIs if you run Microsoft Windows.\n\n35\n00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.120\nYou have Windows for the desktop, but\n\n36\n00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.758\nthen you have the special\nMicrosoft Windows Server.\n\n37\n00:01:43.758 --> 00:01:45.610\nIf you wanna set up a server,\nyou have to go and\n\n38\n00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.960\nbuy a completely different\noperating system.\n\n39\n00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.020\nI say completely different,\nthey're like 95% identical under the hood.\n\n40\n00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.490\nThey run the same kernel,\nthe same code, the same UI.\n\n41\n00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.410\nA little bit of difference, right?\n\n42\n00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.490\nBut Microsoft packages as a completely\nseparate and fairly expensive product.\n\n43\n00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.540\nI think server licenses\nstart like 700 bucks and\n\n44\n00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.340\nthen they go up from there,\nit gets expensive fast.\n\n45\n00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.760\nIn the Linux world it's very similar,\nthat a lot of distributions out there for\n\n46\n00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.520\nLinux has desktop versions and\nserver versions.\n\n47\n00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.130\nNow, they're free so it's not a big deal\nbut when you install a server in the Linux\n\n48\n00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.100\nworld, it typically doesn't have\na graphical user interface.\n\n49\n00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.170\nIt's command line only.\n\n50\n00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.560\nSo, it's a very different beast.\n\n51\n00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.470\nSo normally,\nwhen you start setting up your hardware,\n\n52\n00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.160\nyou have to make\nthe decision very early on.\n\n53\n00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.310\nDo I wanted to be a serve, or\ndo you wanted to be a desktop?\n\n54\n00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.040\nBut, in the Mac world, it's not like that.\n\n55\n00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.190\nUnder the hood, Mac OS or OS 10 is running\nbsd and bsd is a Unix variant, right?\n\n56\n00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.150\nSo to lightly tap on the history,\nback in the 70s, ATT or\n\n57\n00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.050\nI guess it was Bell Labs, created Unix.\n\n58\n00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.720\nIt was an operating system that\ndid some really interesting stuff.\n\n59\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.920\nIt treated a lot of things as files\nwhich was different than most operating\n\n60\n00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.980\nsystems at the time.\n\n61\n00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.350\nIt did really well.\n\n62\n00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.590\nAnd the lab started licensing\nthat out to other people.\n\n63\n00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.250\nOne of the organizations that licensed\nit was the University of Berkley,\n\n64\n00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.810\nsorry the University of\nCalifornia at Berkley.\n\n65\n00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.225\nAnd so at Berkley they they took it and\nthey started adding to it,\n\n66\n00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:08.525\nthey added a lot of tools that made\nit easier to use and more robust and\n\n67\n00:03:08.525 --> 00:03:10.065\nthat's what became BSD.\n\n68\n00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:12.875\nBSD was Berkeley's variation of Unix.\n\n69\n00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:15.185\nNow over the years a lot of\nthat rolled back into Unix so\n\n70\n00:03:15.185 --> 00:03:16.980\nthey kind of benefitted from that.\n\n71\n00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.560\nBut BSD became known as one of\nthe most robust, and friendly, yes,\n\n72\n00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.670\nfriendly as Unix can cast right,\nfriendly Unix distributions.\n\n73\n00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.840\nSo, when Apple switched to OS10, instead\nof having their completely proprietor\n\n74\n00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.920\nsystem they had and always fine earlier,\nalways tend as BSD under the hood.\n\n75\n00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.870\nFor BSD, with design for servers.\n\n76\n00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.750\nAnd we want it as a desk top.\n\n77\n00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.780\nWell Apple applied this nice little\ngraphical user interface to the top of it,\n\n78\n00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.600\nAqua and all the newer variants\nthat have come out since then.\n\n79\n00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.700\nSo, they made it look all pretty and\neasy to use.\n\n80\n00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.780\nAnd so it is super easy to use, but\n\n81\n00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.900\nunder the hood it is a server\ngrade operating system.\n\n82\n00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.810\nIt's really powerful, very stable and\nJust extremely reliable.\n\n83\n00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.890\nSo, if we want to turn our desktop\ninto a server, it's already a server,\n\n84\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.170\nit's just hidden from us.\n\n85\n00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.270\nSo, when I decide I want\nto install OS10 server,\n\n86\n00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.090\nall we're really installing is\na graphical user interface,\n\n87\n00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.030\nan application and that's it, because\nunder the hood we're already a server.\n\n88\n00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.090\nI don't have to buy a special product.\n\n89\n00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.970\nApple did have the XServer\nappliances that you could go out and\n\n90\n00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.130\nbuy the one use servers.\n\n91\n00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.720\nThey don't sell those anymore.\n\n92\n00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.130\nBecause now if you want a server,\nyou just buy a Mac Pro or\n\n93\n00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.420\nan iMac, you can use your MacBook,\nyou can use a Mac Mini.\n\n94\n00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.890\nAny one of them.\n\n95\n00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.950\nThey've already got the server\nless under the head.\n\n96\n00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.460\nYou just install the graphic\nuser interface on it,\n\n97\n00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.460\nand now you've got a server.\n\n98\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.460\nSo it's as simple as\ninstalling a server app.\n\n99\n00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.490\nSo West mentioned hardware.\n\n100\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.220\nIf I'm sealing with Windows or Linux or\nwhatever, I've got to make sure I've got\n\n101\n00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.980\nthe right hardware, I've got to make\nsure I've got the right software.\n\n102\n00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.550\nThere's a lot of decisions.\n\n103\n00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.210\nBut notice ten, if you have a MAC, You\ncan be a server, it's as simple as that.\n\n104\n00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.690\nDoesn't matter which Mac you have,\nas long as it's running OS X,\n\n105\n00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.390\nit can become a server.\n\n106\n00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.520\nNow, for the modern versions of Server,\nthere are some limitations.\n\n107\n00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.690\nSo we have to run\na modern version of OS X.\n\n108\n00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.635\nRemember, there was a big\nswitch back in 10.6,\n\n109\n00:05:10.635 --> 00:05:13.790\nwhen Apple went from 32 bit to 64 bit.\n\n110\n00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.220\nAnd it was kind of optional back then.\n\n111\n00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.460\nYou could still stay 32 bit if you wanted.\n\n112\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.610\nThat decision is long gone now, right?\n\n113\n00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.230\nIt's a 64 bit only world.\n\n114\n00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.810\nSo the current versions of the OS\nten server app are only 64 bit.\n\n115\n00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.800\nSo, if you have an older Mac that's\nstill 32 bit, you can't be a server.\n\n116\n00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.990\nRight but when I say older I'm\ntalking an old this is 2007,\n\n117\n00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.530\n2006 that's when this change\nhappens it's ten years ago.\n\n118\n00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.400\nIf you're in a ten year old Mac first off\nit's very possible right they last a long.\n\n119\n00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.060\nBut secondly you got bigger problems cuz\nthat ten year old Mac isn't gonna have\n\n120\n00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.760\na lot of memory it's not gonna have a\ngreat processor it's gonna be slow and so\n\n121\n00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.500\nyou don't want that to be a server anyway.\n\n122\n00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.120\nRight?\n\n123\n00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.260\nBut any Mac purchased in the last\nseven years can become a server,\n\n124\n00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.240\nin the last ten years,\nreally, can become a server.\n\n125\n00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.600\nAnd you'll be able to jump in and\ndo the stuff cuz technically,\n\n126\n00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.730\nthe operating system's already\ndoing it under the hood.\n\n127\n00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.154\nNow, on Apple's website they do\npost the hardware requirements.\n\n128\n00:06:08.154 --> 00:06:10.470\nAnd it's the same hardware\nrequirements as the OS.\n\n129\n00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.850\nSo if your computer can run El Capitan,\n\n130\n00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.380\nthen you can run the new\nversion of Server.\n\n131\n00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.860\nNow there are new versions\nof Server that come out, and\n\n132\n00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.230\nit's usually whenever the OS updates.\n\n133\n00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:27.836\nSo, for example, under Yosemite,\nso Yosemite was OS ten, ten.ten.\n\n134\n00:06:27.836 --> 00:06:30.399\nWhen El Capitan came out, it was 10.11.\n\n135\n00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:35.447\nWell, under 10.10,\nYou had server version 4.0, or 4.\n\n136\n00:06:35.447 --> 00:06:37.220\nwhatever, right,\nbecause there are a few updates.\n\n137\n00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.880\nWith El Capitan we have server five.\n\n138\n00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.200\nAnd so everytime a new\nversion of the OS comes out,\n\n139\n00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.200\nthey normally release a new\nversion of the server app.\n\n140\n00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.710\nAnd that used to be really important,\nbecause it meant that you could end up in\n\n141\n00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.720\nthese situations where you had\nto buy a server more than once.\n\n142\n00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.010\nNow, when I say buy server,\nwhat am I talking about there?\n\n143\n00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.890\nWell, the server app,\nit's just an application,\n\n144\n00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.740\nit's just a graphical user interface that\nmakes configuring the server a lot easier,\n\n145\n00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.120\nbut you still have to buy it.\n\n146\n00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.870\nIt's in the app store,\nit costs 20 dollars.\n\n147\n00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.610\nSo it's not like Microsoft, where you're\ntalking about 600 or 700 dollars or\n\n148\n00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.330\neven more if you want advanced features.\n\n149\n00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.020\nWith apple, it's just 20 bucks.\n\n150\n00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.750\nAnd it's tied to your apple ID.\n\n151\n00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.850\nSo if you're logged in to five different\nservers, you can install the server at\n\n152\n00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.780\nfive different times, but\nyou only have to buy it once, right?\n\n153\n00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.900\nSo that makes it a lot easier.\n\n154\n00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.860\nI can't even tell you how many installs\nI've done on mine, it's ridiculous.\n\n155\n00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.377\nBecause every time I build up a lab for\nthe show I'm installing the server\n\n156\n00:07:26.377 --> 00:07:29.156\napp over and over again, but\nI just had to pay for it once.\n\n157\n00:07:29.156 --> 00:07:30.750\nNow it wasn't always like that.\n\n158\n00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:36.300\nIn fact it wasn't like that two years\nago even so it was very recently.\n\n159\n00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.575\nWhat used to happen, was every time\na new version of Mac OS came out,\n\n160\n00:07:40.575 --> 00:07:42.836\nyou had to buy the server app again.\n\n161\n00:07:42.836 --> 00:07:47.592\nSo for example, when I first deployed\nMavericks, I had to pay 20 bucks for\n\n162\n00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:48.646\nServer 3.0.\n\n163\n00:07:48.646 --> 00:07:53.850\nAnd then when Yosemite came out I had to\npay 20 bucks to buy Yosemite server 4.0,\n\n164\n00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:54.959\nand to pay again.\n\n165\n00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:57.795\nRight, well in the general scheme\nof things it's only 20 bucks,\n\n166\n00:07:57.795 --> 00:07:59.099\nI didn't think much about it.\n\n167\n00:07:59.099 --> 00:08:02.060\nBut Apple didn't think much about it\neither because they finally said,\n\n168\n00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.329\nyou know that's kinda silly.\n\n169\n00:08:03.329 --> 00:08:06.010\nWe're gonna do away with that now.\n\n170\n00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:10.170\nAnd so the newer versions of the server\napp, so for Maverick, Yosemite, and\n\n171\n00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.735\nEl Capitan,\nif you buy it once it runs on all three.\n\n172\n00:08:12.735 --> 00:08:14.720\nThey've started doing\nwhat's called back porting.\n\n173\n00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.520\nIt used to be that when a new version came\nout they would update the server app for\n\n174\n00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.970\nthe new version and\nit would stop supporting the old version.\n\n175\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.362\nAnd so they wouldn't make it run on\nthe older hardware and the older OSs, but\n\n176\n00:08:23.362 --> 00:08:25.379\nnow they do,\nthey make sure it is supported.\n\n177\n00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:28.643\nSo if you are running Mavericks or higher\nand you have purchased the server app,\n\n178\n00:08:28.643 --> 00:08:32.350\nyou do not even have to purchase it again,\nit's just right there, you install it.\n\n179\n00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.990\nAnd again, at the end of the day it\nis 20 bucks, so it's not that bad.\n\n180\n00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.450\n>> So\nDon I break out my brand new Apple 2E.\n\n181\n00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:43.420\nIt's got megabytes at best of RAM and\nmaybe, kilobytes best at RAM and\n\n182\n00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.730\nmaybe megabytes, for our hard drive space.\n\n183\n00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.270\nNow, chances are it's not gonna run this,\nso what are we looking for\n\n184\n00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:54.560\nas a base hardware requirements to\nrun this server operating system.\n\n185\n00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.810\n>> So the absolute base is the pretty much\nthe minimum you can buy from Apple today,\n\n186\n00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.980\nbut you might have an older machine so\nit might not have it, but\n\n187\n00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.900\nyou need two gigs of RAM.\n\n188\n00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.450\nYou need at least eight gigs of hard drive\nspace to be able to store this stuff,\n\n189\n00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.890\nand when I say at least I really mean that\nbecause these are the bare, bare, bare,\n\n190\n00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.500\nbare, bare minimum.\n\n191\n00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:16.040\nIf you're gonna run a web server, and a\ndatabase, a open directory and a wiki and\n\n192\n00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.800\nall these other things,\nthat 2GB of RAM gets eaten up pretty fast.\n\n193\n00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.550\nAnd the 8GB of hard-drive space,\nthat's just enough for\n\n194\n00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.390\nthe operating system and the server app.\n\n195\n00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:29.030\nBut each of these applications need\nstorage, so for example if I set up a time\n\n196\n00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.900\nmachine server, people are gonna be\nbacking up their computers to my system.\n\n197\n00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.180\nI'm a time machine server.\n\n198\n00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.770\nHow far is 8GB of storage gonna get me?\n\n199\n00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:37.610\nNot very far.\n\n200\n00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.494\nI have to hope everybody has just has an\niPhone, well I can't even make that joke\n\n201\n00:09:40.494 --> 00:09:43.531\nanymore cuz iPhones, what's the smallest\nyou can get now, it's like 16 gigs.\n\n202\n00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:44.306\n>> 16 gigs, yeah.\n\n203\n00:09:44.306 --> 00:09:48.790\n>> So I can't even store a backup of\na single iPhone with 8 gigs of storage.\n\n204\n00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.460\nIt's not enough, right?\n\n205\n00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.410\nSo you're going to need more.\n\n206\n00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.890\nSo when we say the minimums, it's the\nminimums as far as the test is concerned.\n\n207\n00:09:55.890 --> 00:10:00.410\nBut in real life land, you're going to\nneed more absolutely on the storage side,\n\n208\n00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.800\nmore than likely on the RAM side.\n\n209\n00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.704\nYou'll see here in the show most of the\nservers I use only have two gigs of RAM,\n\n210\n00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:06.372\nand that's okay cuz I'm just doing a show.\n\n211\n00:10:06.372 --> 00:10:10.768\nBut if I have 50, 1,000,\n10,000 people using that server,\n\n212\n00:10:10.768 --> 00:10:13.070\nthat 2 gigs of RAM is gone, right.\n\n213\n00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.810\nI really need 16 gigs,\n\n214\n00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.470\nI need 32 gigs of RAM to be able to\nsupport the amount of people connected.\n\n215\n00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.430\nAnd that's where things get tough, Apple\ncan't tell you this is how much memory you\n\n216\n00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.030\nneed, cuz they don't know\nhow many users you have.\n\n217\n00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:25.260\nThey don't know how active your server is.\n\n218\n00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.970\nI might have 1,000 users, but\npeople are only using the system for\n\n219\n00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.050\ntime machine backups and that's it.\n\n220\n00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.820\nI can do 1,000 users of time\nmachine backups in 2 gigs of RAM.\n\n221\n00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.490\nIt'll be fine, right?\n\n222\n00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:40.378\nBut if I have 1,000 users, and they're\nhitting my server for open directory,\n\n223\n00:10:40.378 --> 00:10:42.810\nthat 2 gigs of RAM will\nget eaten up pretty quick,\n\n224\n00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.380\nbecause it's gotta keep\nthat database cache.\n\n225\n00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.310\nIt's gotta handle all that\nauthentication requests.\n\n226\n00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:47.390\nI'm gonna need more memory.\n\n227\n00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:50.660\nSo you need to monitor your systems,\nkeep an eye on it, right?\n\n228\n00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.290\nI know plenty of people that use\nMac Minis as servers all day long, and\n\n229\n00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.140\nthey run great.\n\n230\n00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:59.660\nI know plenty of people that use Mac Pros,\nright, the big cylinders.\n\n231\n00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.780\nThey're a little harder to use as servers\ncuz you can't rack mount them very well.\n\n232\n00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.710\nBut, you can do it, and\n\n233\n00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:08.320\nthey run great, the price difference\nis pretty substantial, though.\n\n234\n00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.090\nYou'll find most people will\nrecognize that having more Mac Minis\n\n235\n00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:13.880\nis better than having one Mac Pro.\n\n236\n00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.670\nYou can actually get a little more effort\nout of it, but it's harder to administer.\n\n237\n00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.100\nYou gotta administer more than one system.\n\n238\n00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.650\nSo these are all decisions you have to\nmake early on about what you wanna do.\n\n239\n00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:23.923\nBut at the end of the day,\n\n240\n00:11:23.923 --> 00:11:28.115\nonce you buy that system, getting it setup\nas a server is really done the same way.\n\n241\n00:11:28.115 --> 00:11:31.086\nIt's really not hard, we can bang\nto the process pretty quickly and\n\n242\n00:11:31.086 --> 00:11:32.820\nget it set up all right.\n\n243\n00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.660\nCouple of considerations before we do it.\n\n244\n00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.208\nSo for example I've got a virtual\nmachine right here that I'm gonna turn\n\n245\n00:11:37.208 --> 00:11:37.764\ninto a server.\n\n246\n00:11:37.764 --> 00:11:41.256\nSo this is a stock install\nof El Capitan right, so\n\n247\n00:11:41.256 --> 00:11:46.466\nif I go into About this Mac, eventually\nI can see its running El Capitan.\n\n248\n00:11:46.466 --> 00:11:51.816\nI'm running 10.11.3, I think I'm behind\nnow, 10.11.4 I think is current.\n\n249\n00:11:51.816 --> 00:11:55.534\nBut by the time you watch this\nepisode it'll probably be 10.11.5.\n\n250\n00:11:55.534 --> 00:11:59.580\nI've got dual processor,\nI've only got 2 GB of RAM.\n\n251\n00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.830\nNow that's not a ton of memory, but\nit meets the minimum requirements, so\n\n252\n00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.050\nI'll be okay.\n\n253\n00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:07.390\nIf this was a production system\nI'd probably want more memory.\n\n254\n00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.080\nSo there it is, I've got that up.\n\n255\n00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.060\nMy hard drive space, it doesn't show me\nhow much hard drive space I have here, but\n\n256\n00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.250\nI can, I can go and pull and\nget info on my drive.\n\n257\n00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:20.020\nAnd I can see that I've got a 42 GB\nhard drive, I've got 28 GB available,\n\n258\n00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.490\nmore than enough for the server app.\n\n259\n00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.980\nSo I meet my minimum requirements.\n\n260\n00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:28.770\nSo I'm able to install server,\nand get this guy up and going.\n\n261\n00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:32.310\nJust make sure you meet those minimum\nrequirements and you'll be in business.\n\n262\n00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:37.220\nOther things, with a laptop,\nI'm on a laptop right here on the show.\n\n263\n00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.480\nIf I set this up as a server,\n\n264\n00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.940\nwhat happens at the end of the day when\nI turn my laptop off and take it home?\n\n265\n00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.200\nServer's down, people can't get to it.\n\n266\n00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.260\nServers are different than workstations.\n\n267\n00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.480\nWorkstations we expect to be turned on and\nturned off.\n\n268\n00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.180\nA server we expect to always be on,\nand always be available.\n\n269\n00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:59.360\nAnd so to help make sure that happens,\nthere's two things we need to do.\n\n270\n00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.100\nOne, we need a static IP address.\n\n271\n00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.530\nMost Macs will use DHCP by default right?\n\n272\n00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.170\nSo they'll get a dynamic\naddress off of the network.\n\n273\n00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.620\nYour system boots up and\nit reaches out to the network says hey,\n\n274\n00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.070\ncan somebody help me and\ngive me an IP address?\n\n275\n00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.310\nAnd hopefully there's a DHCP server\non the network that then says here's\n\n276\n00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.770\nan address you can use.\n\n277\n00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:20.440\nThe problem with that is\nthe addresses change, right?\n\n278\n00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.300\nThe next time I reboot this server or\nif I turn it off for a little while and\n\n279\n00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.680\nturn it back on,\nI might get a different address.\n\n280\n00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.100\nAnd now everybody has to find it again.\n\n281\n00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.850\nFor some systems like the Time Machine\nbackup server, it uses Bonjour.\n\n282\n00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:35.010\nIt'll find the server, it doesn't\nmatter if the IP changes, that's okay.\n\n283\n00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:39.620\nBut, for DNS, if this is gonna be a DNS\nserver I need it to have a static IP,\n\n284\n00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.820\ncuz I need my clients\nconfigured to use it.\n\n285\n00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.620\nSo, you likely wanna set a static\nIP address on your system.\n\n286\n00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.730\nAnd then the other thing is power saving.\n\n287\n00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.140\nMacs go to sleep by default,\n\n288\n00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.480\nif they sit there idle for\nhours on end, they go to sleep.\n\n289\n00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.980\nWe probably don't want that, it's okay for\na screen saver to come on, or\n\n290\n00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.060\nlock the screen.\n\n291\n00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:01.000\nBut if the system goes to sleep, now\npeople can't access the services on it, so\n\n292\n00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.510\nwe need to turn that off too, right?\n\n293\n00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.460\nSo let's run through that here with\nthis system so, I'm gonna jump into my\n\n294\n00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.680\nSystem Preferences and let's go\ncheck that IP address first, right?\n\n295\n00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.118\nSo I'm just gonna jump into my Networking.\n\n296\n00:14:11.118 --> 00:14:15.410\nAnd inside of my network,\nsure enough I'm using DHCP.\n\n297\n00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:18.630\nSo, if my address changes,\nnow clients have to find me again.\n\n298\n00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.830\nAnd if it's something like a DNS server,\n\n299\n00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.550\nI might have to go an edit the DNS\nsetting on all of my clients.\n\n300\n00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:24.280\nThat's a lot of work.\n\n301\n00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.170\nI don't want that.\n\n302\n00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:26.590\nI want a static IP.\n\n303\n00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:27.970\nSo I'm gonna change this.\n\n304\n00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.290\nNow my current IP is .154.\n\n305\n00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:30.870\nI'm gonna change that.\n\n306\n00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:36.381\nLet's go Manual, and\nwe'll go 192.168.0.100, right?\n\n307\n00:14:36.381 --> 00:14:37.900\nSo it's gonna be .100.\n\n308\n00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.530\nNow, if I have a DHCP server,\n\n309\n00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:43.760\nI probably need to pay attention to\nwhat addresses are already in use.\n\n310\n00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.110\nI think 100 is actually in my DHCP scope.\n\n311\n00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:50.470\nSo my DHCP server could issue this address\nto somebody else, and that would be bad.\n\n312\n00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:51.699\nSo you know what, let me make it .10.\n\n313\n00:14:51.699 --> 00:14:53.390\n.10 is outside of my DHCP scope.\n\n314\n00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.160\nNow I don't have to worry\nabout duplicate IPs.\n\n315\n00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.690\nThe rest of the information\ncan say the same.\n\n316\n00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:00.540\nI still have the same subnet masks,\nthe same router that I'm gonna use to\n\n317\n00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.440\nget out of the network, and\nthen the same DNS server.\n\n318\n00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.290\nI might even need to change that\nbased on whatever my needs are.\n\n319\n00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.300\nI've got a static IP, so\nI know no matter what happens,\n\n320\n00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.075\nI'll always have the same address.\n\n321\n00:15:12.075 --> 00:15:15.488\nThe next thing I'm gonna do\nis check my power saving.\n\n322\n00:15:15.488 --> 00:15:18.992\nSo I'm gonna go right here into\nSystem Preferences and my Energy Saver.\n\n323\n00:15:18.992 --> 00:15:22.511\nAnd inside Energy Saver, sure enough,\nmy computer's set to go to sleep after,\n\n324\n00:15:22.511 --> 00:15:23.772\nwhat is that, ten minutes?\n\n325\n00:15:23.772 --> 00:15:25.002\nYeah, after ten minutes.\n\n326\n00:15:25.002 --> 00:15:27.330\nSo after ten minutes,\nit's gonna go to sleep.\n\n327\n00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.030\nSo I can set this server up and\nget it running perfectly, and\n\n328\n00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.990\nit will run great for ten minutes.\n\n329\n00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.090\nAnd then it's gonna go to sleep and\n\n330\n00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:35.910\nI'm going to start getting phone calls\nfrom people saying hey I can't browse\n\n331\n00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.320\nthe Internet cuz DNS isn't working.\n\n332\n00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.100\nOr my time machine backup is failing\ncuz the server can't be reached.\n\n333\n00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:48.040\nAnd remember in El Capitan you have the\npower nap option, you see it on laptops.\n\n334\n00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.205\nThis one shows as a desktop so\nI don't have it here.\n\n335\n00:15:50.205 --> 00:15:53.252\nPower nap says wake the system up for\nnetwork activity like checking email,\n\n336\n00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:55.313\nnotifications, and\ndoing time machine backups.\n\n337\n00:15:55.313 --> 00:15:57.437\nWell, that's for itself.\n\n338\n00:15:57.437 --> 00:15:59.654\nNot for other people on the network.\n\n339\n00:15:59.654 --> 00:16:01.326\nSo Power Nap is not good enough.\n\n340\n00:16:01.326 --> 00:16:04.480\nYour clients won't wake the server\nup if Power Nap is turned on.\n\n341\n00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.900\nSo we really need to turn off sleep.\n\n342\n00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:11.330\nYou can keep the display sleep on, that's\nokay, but I'm gonna take the computer\n\n343\n00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.920\nsleep and way over here on the end we've\ngot that never option I'm gonna never and\n\n344\n00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.630\nApple hates it when you do that so\nyou get a warning.\n\n345\n00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:21.020\nIt says your computer may use\nmore energy with these settings.\n\n346\n00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.880\nOn a laptop it'll warn you that your\nhardware might not last as long, right?\n\n347\n00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:30.020\nYou're normally gonna use a desktop,\na Mac mini, or a Mac Pro for a server.\n\n348\n00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.890\nSo we don't really care about this option.\n\n349\n00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:33.450\nWe'll say okay, and now it's set.\n\n350\n00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:33.950\nAll right.\n\n351\n00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.440\nSo my system's not gonna go to sleep.\n\n352\n00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.550\nPeople will be able to use it.\n\n353\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:41.100\nThere is one more thing that I want\nto tinker with while I'm in here.\n\n354\n00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:46.090\nI'm gonna go back up to my\nSystem Preferences, and go into Sharing.\n\n355\n00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.580\nInside of Sharing,\nyou've got a Computer Name, okay?\n\n356\n00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.800\nYou can change your computer\nname whenever you want.\n\n357\n00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.490\nBut, if you're setting up a server,\n\n358\n00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.940\nit's best to change the computer name\nfirst, before you get your server set up.\n\n359\n00:16:58.940 --> 00:16:59.590\nAll right.\n\n360\n00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:04.750\nBecause the computer name will make it\ninto some of the configuration files, and\n\n361\n00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.390\nwith some of the servers,\nthe messaging server in particular,\n\n362\n00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:12.870\nif you set up the chat server it is a pain\nin the butt to get that chat server\n\n363\n00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:17.420\nworking again once you change the name,\nso it's best to change it ahead of time.\n\n364\n00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.388\nAnd I wanna call this system OSX-SERVER02,\nright?\n\n365\n00:17:21.388 --> 00:17:27.240\nSo, I'm gonna change that name right now,\nto avoid that headache later on.\n\n366\n00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.290\nYou can change it later on, and some\nservices like the Time Machine backup will\n\n367\n00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:34.934\nwork just fine, but other ones like the\nchat server start to run into problems,\n\n368\n00:17:34.934 --> 00:17:37.500\nso best to change it ahead of time so\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n369\n00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.330\nNow Don, when you set up static\nIP Addresses like this and\n\n370\n00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:45.320\nyou're turning off the energy\nsaving parameters here.\n\n371\n00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.060\nIt looks like you're setting your clients\nup so they don't have to play a cloak and\n\n372\n00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.820\ndagger just to be able to find\nthe server on your network now?\n\n373\n00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:52.800\n>> Yeah, that's basically it, right?\n\n374\n00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.620\nWe want a consistent\npresence on the network.\n\n375\n00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.450\nIf my client thinks that there's\na Time Machine backup server at this\n\n376\n00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.720\naddress I want to always be there, right?\n\n377\n00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.720\nSo things run faster.\n\n378\n00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:07.200\nI don't want there to be a delay when\nthey go to launch their chat client.\n\n379\n00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.310\nIt has to do a delay cuz\nit's gotta find the server.\n\n380\n00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:12.100\nI want it to go right to and\nget to so its fast and reliable.\n\n381\n00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:12.690\nAll right.\n\n382\n00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.570\nWe can always set up more than one server\nif you're worried about a failure.\n\n383\n00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.230\nYou've got more than one server so if one\nfails, the other one takes over right?\n\n384\n00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.510\nWe can get that redundancy.\n\n385\n00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:21.750\nSo having that static presence\nthat's really important.\n\n386\n00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:26.380\nSo setting up the IP address, turning off\nthe sleep function, setting the name.\n\n387\n00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.470\nI just did that because it's my own\npersonal habit of making sure it's ready\n\n388\n00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:31.240\nbefore I install the server app.\n\n389\n00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:31.890\nOkay.\n\n390\n00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.250\nAt this point we're ready\nto install the server app.\n\n391\n00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:36.170\nSo we can jump in there and\nknock that out, and\n\n392\n00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:40.020\ninstalling it is really easy cuz we just\ngo to the App Store and install it, right?\n\n393\n00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.980\nSo let me dive into my App Store here.\n\n394\n00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.950\nNow you will need an Apple ID, and\n\n395\n00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:46.470\nyou'll need a credit card cuz\nyou've got to buy it, right?\n\n396\n00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.670\nIt's $20.\nSo you gotta make sure that you buy that\n\n397\n00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.080\nand once you've got it,\nyou'll be in business.\n\n398\n00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.880\nNow, shoot, notice I'm getting,\nCannot Connect to the App store.\n\n399\n00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.670\nI've seen this bug in\nEl Capitan a few times where,\n\n400\n00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:02.070\nwhen you change the IP address,\nyou guys saw it on the screen.\n\n401\n00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.300\nI had a DNS server and a gateway.\n\n402\n00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:08.760\nWhen you go from DHCP to a static,\nit shows it on the screen and then\n\n403\n00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.900\nit loses it when you close the panel and\nso I'll bet that's what's happened here.\n\n404\n00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.870\nLet me get out of my App Store and\ngo back into System Preferences.\n\n405\n00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:15.810\nAnd we'll go in and fix that.\n\n406\n00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.050\nIt's kind of annoying little quirk.\n\n407\n00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:18.550\nYup.\n\n408\n00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.700\nSee, how I kept my router but\nlook what DNS server I'm using.\n\n409\n00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.610\nI lost my DNS server, so,\nthat's why I'm not getting in there.\n\n410\n00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:29.840\nSo, let me just go right back in here and\nI'm gonna go and add two DNS servers.\n\n411\n00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.549\nI'll just use Google's DNS servers,\nthey got some public servers we can use.\n\n412\n00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:38.040\nThere we go, whoops, too many servers.\n\n413\n00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.400\nThere we go.\nAll right, so\n\n414\n00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.940\nnow I've got those two\nservers put in place.\n\n415\n00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.260\nWe should get a little bit better results.\n\n416\n00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:47.720\n[LAUGH] And so I go back to the App Store\nand let's see what we get this game.\n\n417\n00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.952\nIt's a weird little quirk you\nkinda get used to I guess.\n\n418\n00:19:50.952 --> 00:19:53.828\nI didn't get too used to it because\nthen I didn't remember to do it.\n\n419\n00:19:53.828 --> 00:19:57.330\n[LAUGH] All right so I am in my App Store\nand once I am in the App Store I can\n\n420\n00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.860\ngo up here and search for\nthe word server and if you just search for\n\n421\n00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.560\nthe word server it will be one\nof the first ones that comes up.\n\n422\n00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.600\nSo I am gonna search for that and\nthere it is right there OS 10 server.\n\n423\n00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.060\nNow it is gonna be kind of hard to read on\nthe screen but if you see in the button\n\n424\n00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:14.140\nIt's that whole white text on a grey\nbutton thing that's kind of annoying,\n\n425\n00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:19.130\nbut it's $19.99 American Dollars in\nyour environment it may be more or less.\n\n426\n00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.460\nNow, one word of caution on the ratings.\n\n427\n00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:26.300\nI have seen some of the server deployments\nwhere they'll get one star, or two stars.\n\n428\n00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.580\nThey'll get terrible reviews.\n\n429\n00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.360\nThe thing is, it's cheap and\nit's accessible,\n\n430\n00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.570\nso, anybody can deploy the server app.\n\n431\n00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:37.180\nUnfortunately, anybody, includes a lot of\npeople who don't know what they are doing.\n\n432\n00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.010\nAnd, so, if you read the reviews,\nit's almost comical.\n\n433\n00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.610\nYou know, some of these people,\n\n434\n00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:45.290\nthey deploy it not realizing,\nI've got to do maintenance on my server.\n\n435\n00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.920\nOr, it's not that easy\nto set up an XN cluster.\n\n436\n00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.450\nRight?\nThey just kind of assume\n\n437\n00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.020\neverything is gonna be hit\na radio button and you're done.\n\n438\n00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.160\nWell, a lot of it is.\n\n439\n00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.760\nA lot of it is hitting a radio button, but\nthere's some things we'll see throughout\n\n440\n00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.910\nthis whole series that\nrequire a bit of work.\n\n441\n00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:03.520\nSo just ignore the ratings that are on\nthere and just jump right in there.\n\n442\n00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.770\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick on the OS X Server.\n\n443\n00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.790\nAnyway you'll see little screen shots and\nso on and\n\n444\n00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:13.530\nwhat I wanted to point out here\nis what's new in Version 5.1.\n\n445\n00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:17.860\nThis is Version 5,\nVersion 5 is made for El Capitan.\n\n446\n00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.380\nIf I'm running Mavericks I\nneed server three.\n\n447\n00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.850\nIf I'm running Yosemite I\nneed server four.\n\n448\n00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:25.180\nHere in El Capitan it's server five.\n\n449\n00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.780\nSo there's new versions all the time.\n\n450\n00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.290\nSo if you've installed it on one system\nand you're just copying the file and\n\n451\n00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:35.230\nmoving over to another system, you can\nactually do that as long as the OS if\n\n452\n00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:39.020\nthe right version and we need to\nmake sure it's the right version.\n\n453\n00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.250\nNow I never did buy Version 5.\n\n454\n00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:45.540\nI bought Version 3 and\nthat gave me Version 4 and Version 5.\n\n455\n00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.800\nI also bought Version 2 and Version 1.\n\n456\n00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.340\nI had to buy those individually\nbecause that was prior to the change.\n\n457\n00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.910\nSo, it's nice I don't\nhave to buy it again.\n\n458\n00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:54.430\nBut it is telling me I need to buy it and\nthe reason is,\n\n459\n00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:57.730\nI've got the whole family account thing\nand I bought it under one account.\n\n460\n00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.560\nAnd so here it's just kind of\nwarning me and it's telling me\n\n461\n00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:05.620\nserver can't be installed on Macintosh HD\nbecause OS X version 10.11.4 is required.\n\n462\n00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:11.484\nI'm running 10.11,\nI'm running El Capitan, right?\n\n463\n00:22:11.484 --> 00:22:15.678\nWell, 5.1 was designed for 10.11.4.\n\n464\n00:22:15.678 --> 00:22:17.950\nI\"m running 10.11.3.\n\n465\n00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:18.600\nAll right.\n\n466\n00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.570\nSo if I had server version\n5.0 I could run it, but\n\n467\n00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:27.550\nApple's updated to 5.1, so I need to do\nmy updates first before I can install it.\n\n468\n00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:31.370\nAnd, if I look under my updates,\nsure enough, I should see that I've got\n\n469\n00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:35.370\nan update available I hope, and\nit should be the 10.11.4 update, and so\n\n470\n00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:40.580\nI can choose that Once that's done,\nI'll be able to install that server app.\n\n471\n00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.390\nSo let me just jump over here and\nsure enough,\n\n472\n00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:46.980\nright here I've got that\nOS X El Capitan update 10.11.4, and\n\n473\n00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:50.270\nI can just come over here and\nhit update and it's going to update that.\n\n474\n00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:54.820\nOnce it's done, it's gonna reboot and\nI'll be in 10.11.4 and\n\n475\n00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.790\nfrom there I'll be able to\ninstall that server app.\n\n476\n00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.040\nWhich is really just the GUI for\n\n477\n00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.310\nall the server components\nthat are behind the scene.\n\n478\n00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:04.860\nSo that'll get installed and\nthen we'll be able to fire it up.\n\n479\n00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:09.000\n>> Now Don, one of the things that you did\nmention is that we can run OS X Server on\n\n480\n00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.160\nany device like the MacBook Pro\nright here, and\n\n481\n00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:15.320\none of the things that I have on this\nMacBook Pro is a Fusion Drive, right?\n\n482\n00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.840\nSo is there any drive preparation that\nhas to go on as far as installing your\n\n483\n00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.540\noperating system?\n\n484\n00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:24.320\nIf I am saying using my laptop\nas a normal just laptop but\n\n485\n00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.900\nI decide that I wanna move to server or\nthere's some things that I have to get\n\n486\n00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.800\nprepared in order to install\nthe operating system before hand?\n\n487\n00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.380\n>> Yeah, you know what, when we're\ndoing the basic install here it,\n\n488\n00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.720\njust assumes you got one hard\ndrive because all Macs do and\n\n489\n00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.550\neven if you have a fusion drive,\nits two drives.\n\n490\n00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.670\nWhat they is one drive but\n\n491\n00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:43.060\na recommendation that I have is prior\nto getting the server all set up and\n\n492\n00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.043\nconfigured, it's a good\nidea to have two drives.\n\n493\n00:23:45.043 --> 00:23:47.555\nRight.\nTwo separate hard drives.\n\n494\n00:23:47.555 --> 00:23:49.549\nNow you could take one drive and\npartition it or\n\n495\n00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:51.349\nhave two separate physical hard drives.\n\n496\n00:23:51.349 --> 00:23:54.403\nBut the thing is, The server actually\ngonna take a lot of storage.\n\n497\n00:23:54.403 --> 00:23:56.783\nEspecially if you're running like\na time machine backup servers.\n\n498\n00:23:56.783 --> 00:23:58.080\nYou gonna need a lot of storage.\n\n499\n00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.210\nAnd so I recommend having a second\nhard drive available for that.\n\n500\n00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:04.460\nIn that way, you can have the server\napp storage on one drive and\n\n501\n00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.640\nyour operating system on another one,\nright?\n\n502\n00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.880\nEven doing separate partition is\nnice if it's one hard drive and\n\n503\n00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.810\nthat's because you know when your\ntime machine backups growing and\n\n504\n00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:14.450\nfilling up the whole hard drive.\n\n505\n00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.020\nAnd now,\nyour OS doesn't have room to read, right?\n\n506\n00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.360\nSo you wanna separate that out,\nso that's another thing.\n\n507\n00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.840\nPrior to actually getting the server app\nfired up, we'll want to make sure that our\n\n508\n00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.330\nhard drives are configured and\npartitioning to put in place.\n\n509\n00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.768\nSo that's definitely something we\nwant to take care of, all right?\n\n510\n00:24:27.768 --> 00:24:32.460\nNow, how you go by that's up to you, and\nyou can always change your mind later on.\n\n511\n00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.130\nI'll show you in the later episodes.\n\n512\n00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:36.690\nWe can move the storage\nfrom one drive to another.\n\n513\n00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:41.380\nThing is, when the server is brand\nnew how much server data do we have?\n\n514\n00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:42.565\nNone, it's empty.\n\n515\n00:24:42.565 --> 00:24:45.765\nBut, if my server has been running for\nfive years and\n\n516\n00:24:45.765 --> 00:24:48.980\nI've got 100 time machine\nbackups on my system.\n\n517\n00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.697\nAnd I've got a mail server that's got\npeople's email from ten years ago on\n\n518\n00:24:52.697 --> 00:24:54.474\nthere, it's a lot of data to move.\n\n519\n00:24:54.474 --> 00:24:58.220\nAnd so moving the data after\nthe fact is very time consuming,\n\n520\n00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.560\nit takes a lot of effort to\nget that process moved ove.\n\n521\n00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.940\nAnd you've gotta kinda run through that\nwhole set up, and once that's done,\n\n522\n00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.670\nthen you're back online.\n\n523\n00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:09.940\nBut you just had downtime the whole\ntime the system was offline and\n\n524\n00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.200\nyou were moving it.\n\n525\n00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.650\nFar easier to do it right\nin the first place.\n\n526\n00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:15.250\nSo partition out your system.\n\n527\n00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:18.960\nIf you have one hard drive, just divide it\nup into some partitions to isolate data.\n\n528\n00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.940\nBut ideally, have two hard drives,\nhave more, right?\n\n529\n00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.710\nHave an Xsan attached,\nand have tons of storage.\n\n530\n00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.515\nPlan for that storage, understand what\nyou're gonna need for your system.\n\n531\n00:25:27.515 --> 00:25:29.845\n>> Don, if somebody is\nconsidering partitioning and\n\n532\n00:25:29.845 --> 00:25:31.370\ngetting their drives prepared.\n\n533\n00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:34.250\nDo you have a recommendation when it\ncomes to as far as the file systems\n\n534\n00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.580\nthat we've talked about in some of the\nother episodes, as we talk about Apple?\n\n535\n00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.220\n>> It's not so much a recommendation,\nit's a requirement.\n\n536\n00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.060\n>> You need to have OS\n10 extended journaled.\n\n537\n00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.410\nRight?\nWhen you format that drive,\n\n538\n00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.223\nit's got to be in that OS 10 format\nbecause of file permissions.\n\n539\n00:25:47.223 --> 00:25:54.360\nIf it's formatted FAT32 or exFAT or\nany of even the Unix formats like ext4.\n\n540\n00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.640\nWell, Mac OSX supports those but\n\n541\n00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.820\nit doesn't support all the extra\nfeatures that we need.\n\n542\n00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.060\nThe things like the file metadata and\nso on.\n\n543\n00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.011\nSo whatever you use for\n\n544\n00:26:02.011 --> 00:26:05.178\nyour storage really does need to be\nformatted OS 10 extended journaled.\n\n545\n00:26:05.178 --> 00:26:06.583\nIt's your server.\n\n546\n00:26:06.583 --> 00:26:08.661\nThese drives are gonna be permanent.\n\n547\n00:26:08.661 --> 00:26:09.822\nYou're hooking them up to the system.\n\n548\n00:26:09.822 --> 00:26:10.765\nYou're not gonna be removing them.\n\n549\n00:26:10.765 --> 00:26:13.989\nSo it's not like you need compatibility\nto move them over to Windows anyway.\n\n550\n00:26:13.989 --> 00:26:15.880\nYou'll want to go OS X Extended Journaled.\n\n551\n00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:20.264\nNow, whether you wanna go encrypted or\ncase sensitive is up to you, all right?\n\n552\n00:26:20.264 --> 00:26:23.180\nBut just a couple of\nwords of caution on that.\n\n553\n00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.940\nIf you go case sensitive,\nyou've got to remember it.\n\n554\n00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.100\nAll of the server apps are okay with that.\n\n555\n00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.430\nThey all behave case sensitive anyways,\nso it doesn't really matter to them.\n\n556\n00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:35.150\nBut you've got to remember it as\nyou administer that server and\n\n557\n00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:37.760\nwork with the files that the file\nsystem is case-sensitive.\n\n558\n00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.797\nOn the encrypted side,\nthat's okay too, right?\n\n559\n00:26:40.797 --> 00:26:43.335\nIt's okay to encrypt it, the server\napp doesn't even actually know it\n\n560\n00:26:43.335 --> 00:26:45.890\nbecause the encryption happens\ninside of the OS itself.\n\n561\n00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:51.770\nBut if you reboot the system, it's gonna\ngo to boot up, and what'll we see?\n\n562\n00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.080\nWell before we can access that drive,\nwe gotta provide credentials.\n\n563\n00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.180\nIf the credentials are tied to our\naccount, that means we got to log in.\n\n564\n00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:59.040\nIf we don't log in,\nthe drive is encrypted and locked.\n\n565\n00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.190\nSo if the server reboots, the server\nservices don't start do they, right?\n\n566\n00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:04.540\nBecause that drive is encrypted,\n\n567\n00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:09.320\nand that's because we chose the OS X\nextended journaled encrypted format.\n\n568\n00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.681\nIf you do file vault,\nit's different though.\n\n569\n00:27:11.681 --> 00:27:17.030\nWith file vault the system can boot up and\nwell, you do get to a log in screen.\n\n570\n00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:20.879\nThe drives are encrypted but the log\nin screen isn't the log in screen for\n\n571\n00:27:20.879 --> 00:27:23.678\nOS 10, it's the log in screen for\nrecovery mode.\n\n572\n00:27:23.678 --> 00:27:26.704\nAnd you punch in your credentials and\nthen it unlocks the drive and\n\n573\n00:27:26.704 --> 00:27:28.270\nthen it boots the real OS.\n\n574\n00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:30.570\nAnd you end up in the same situation\nwhere the drives are encrypted and\n\n575\n00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:31.880\nthe server services don't start.\n\n576\n00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.240\nSo when you do drive\nencryption on a server\n\n577\n00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.220\nyou got to be very careful about reboots.\n\n578\n00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:41.250\nIf the system reboots the services may\nnot be able to start without you logging\n\n579\n00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.198\nin first.\n\n580\n00:27:42.198 --> 00:27:45.383\nAnd you could set up automatic logon but\nthat's not a great idea is it?\n\n581\n00:27:45.383 --> 00:27:50.146\nEspecially on a server so a lot of times\nwe don't encrypt the drives on a server,\n\n582\n00:27:50.146 --> 00:27:50.900\nright?\n\n583\n00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.620\nAnd it's just because we wanna make\nsure that all of the services can start\n\n584\n00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.140\nwhen the system boots up.\n\n585\n00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.960\n>> All right a lot of good information\nDon and looking at our time it does\n\n586\n00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.549\nlook like we're coming just about\nto the end of this episode.\n\n587\n00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:03.321\nBut I know we've got a lot\nmore configurations to go so\n\n588\n00:28:03.321 --> 00:28:06.600\nit does look like Don we might have\nto do a part two, on this one.\n\n589\n00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:11.010\nBut do you have any other words of advice,\nbefore we call it a day?\n\n590\n00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.490\n>> Let's see, just remember\nthat the hardware requirements,\n\n591\n00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:14.410\nreally don't have to worry about.\n\n592\n00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:16.070\nYou do need to know them for the exam.\n\n593\n00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:17.090\nThat's, kinda, the important part.\n\n594\n00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.850\nSo, remember, that two gigs of ram,\neight gigs of hard drive space.\n\n595\n00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.470\nI know it's laughable today,\nthat's such a low number.\n\n596\n00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:24.300\nBut, on the exam, you wanna know it.\n\n597\n00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:28.140\nRemember that the server really just is\nan app that we're installing on top of our\n\n598\n00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.010\nbase OS so there's nothing special we\nhave to do with the operating system\n\n599\n00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:32.220\nyou're already good to go.\n\n600\n00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.823\nIt does cost twenty dollars in the app\nstore you gotta buy it and your operating\n\n601\n00:28:35.823 --> 00:28:39.047\nsystem version has to be the right\nversion to support the server app.\n\n602\n00:28:39.047 --> 00:28:41.890\nI couldn't install it here cause I was\nrunning ten point eleven point three.\n\n603\n00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:45.940\nI gotta update to point four before\nI can install the current server app.\n\n604\n00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:50.050\nIf I didn't want that, one thing you\ncan do is over the years as you work\n\n605\n00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:53.000\nwith this, you can start saving\ncopies of the server app.\n\n606\n00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.530\nI could have saved a copy of 5.0, and\n\n607\n00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:59.030\nthat way I could have thrown it right on\nhere like a side load and brought it up.\n\n608\n00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:00.340\nIdeally we just update though.\n\n609\n00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.260\nApple releases these updates for\na reason, so\n\n610\n00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.260\nwe need to do them to run\nthe latest server versions.\n\n611\n00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:08.275\nNow in the next episode we're\ngonna see actually installing.\n\n612\n00:29:08.275 --> 00:29:10.950\nAnyway we did a whole episode on server\nI didn't even install the darn thing.\n\n613\n00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:13.282\nSo we'll see installing it\ncuz we'll be updated and\n\n614\n00:29:13.282 --> 00:29:16.520\nthen I'm gonna also show you upgrading\nbecause that's important too.\n\n615\n00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:20.210\nIt's a little different when you\nupgrade from Yosemite to El Capitan,\n\n616\n00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:22.228\nyou've got to upgrade the server app also.\n\n617\n00:29:22.228 --> 00:29:26.260\nSo I wanna show that to you, and we'll\nget a chance to see that all in part two.\n\n618\n00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.650\n>> All right a lot of good information,\na lot of exciting information to come,\n\n619\n00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:31.390\nI look forward to joining you with that.\n\n620\n00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:33.870\nAnd we look forward to seeing\nyou there as well, but\n\n621\n00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:38.270\nuntil we see you next time, signing off\nfor ITProTV I've been your host Wes Brian.\n\n622\n00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:39.070\n>> And I'm Don Pizet.\n\n623\n00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:40.791\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n624\n00:29:40.791 --> 00:29:45.870\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Bryan,\n\n3\n00:00:16.468 --> 00:00:19.551\nand in today's episode we're\ncoming back with a part two.\n\n4\n00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:20.550\nThat's right.\n\n5\n00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.320\nWe talked a lot in part one so we couldn't\nget all that information in here so,\n\n6\n00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.000\nto help us out with that today is\nnone other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.730\nWelcome back Don, how you doing today sir?\n\n8\n00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.690\n>> I'm doing great Wes,\nready to jump right back in and\n\n9\n00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.540\nlet's just kinda refresh\nour memories here.\n\n10\n00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.590\nIn the last episode we went to\ninstall the OS X server app, and\n\n11\n00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.860\nwhat did we run into to?\n\n12\n00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.480\nWell we checked our hardware requirements,\nwe were good there.\n\n13\n00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.770\nWe checked our storage and other things,\neverything looked good, except for\n\n14\n00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.000\nthe version of our OS.\n\n15\n00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.470\nThe version of the OS is tied\nto the server app and so\n\n16\n00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.400\nI was running 10.11.3, had to update to\n10.11.4 to run the latest server app.\n\n17\n00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.980\nThe upgrade is done, so\nlet's jump in here and verify that, and\n\n18\n00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.100\nwe should be good to go.\n\n19\n00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.920\nSo, if I go into my About this Mac,\nI can see my upgrade did finish, and\n\n20\n00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.810\nI'm now running 10.11.4.\n\n21\n00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.770\nIt was a minor update.\n\n22\n00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.520\nIt wasn't a big deal.\n\n23\n00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.490\nIt wasn't like updating\nYosemite to El Capitan, right?\n\n24\n00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.670\nJust a simple security update.\n\n25\n00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.250\nBut now that's done,\nI can jump back into the app store.\n\n26\n00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.310\nAnd I'm just going to do a quick\nsearch for the word server, and\n\n27\n00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.700\nthere is the OS X server\npopping up right there,\n\n28\n00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.110\nand I can click on that and\nit showed that I needed 10.11.4.\n\n29\n00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.550\nSo now that I'm updated,\nI can jump in and we can buy that app.\n\n30\n00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.652\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and buy it.\n\n31\n00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:29.530\nIt's gonna ask me for my apple ID,\nlet's see, what we'll play,\n\n32\n00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.260\ncan I remember my password?\n\n33\n00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.280\nOne of my favorite games.\n\n34\n00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.610\nAnd we're gonna punch that in and\nwell, you know what?\n\n35\n00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.010\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n36\n00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.902\n>> I tell you typing all those dots,\nit is definitely difficult.\n\n37\n00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:45.300\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I set my password ten dots and.\n\n38\n00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.140\nAnd [LAUGH] there we go, so\nit's gonna go and buy it.\n\n39\n00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.780\nNow the thing about mine is this\nis a typical Apple app and so\n\n40\n00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.040\nthey've got what's called Family Sharing.\n\n41\n00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.090\nSo right here you see Family Sharing: Yes.\n\n42\n00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.140\nSo if you have a family setup of more than\none account and you've already bought it\n\n43\n00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.560\non one account, then you can install it\nwithout paying for it on another one.\n\n44\n00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.030\nSo I have already bought it on another\naccount which is what it's gonna show, and\n\n45\n00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.640\nfrom there I'll be able to install it.\n\n46\n00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.000\nAll right, there we go,\nthat's what I expected to see.\n\n47\n00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.940\nSo it's just kinda popping up here and\ntelling me the update is free, so\n\n48\n00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.700\nit's just telling me that I own\na previous version of this item and that.\n\n49\n00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.830\nThat's something that didn't happen\nin older versions of the server.\n\n50\n00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.050\nThey made you buy it with\nevery single one, right?\n\n51\n00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.590\nSo I'd have to buy the new one.\n\n52\n00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.460\nBut you don't have to do that anymore,\nso now it's cool.\n\n53\n00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.402\nI just hit OK, and\nit's gonna get in there and get installed.\n\n54\n00:02:28.402 --> 00:02:30.890\nAll right now,\nif you hadn't purchased this before,\n\n55\n00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.890\nthis is where you're swiping your\ncredit card and paying your 20 bucks.\n\n56\n00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.130\nTo get it installed.\n\n57\n00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.010\nNow when it installs, what it's doing\nis it's loading up the graphical user\n\n58\n00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.430\ninterface and a few other side pieces\nthat come along with the server app.\n\n59\n00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.300\nBut the bulk of what it's gonna use\nis already present on your system.\n\n60\n00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.320\nSo it's really only adding\na small amount of data.\n\n61\n00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.633\nBut once it's there, we're now a server.\n\n62\n00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:52.172\nRight?\n\n63\n00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:55.020\nBut things aren't gonna\nlook very different and\n\n64\n00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.590\nthat's because technically your\nsystem was already a server.\n\n65\n00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.360\nWe just now have the management piece for\nit.\n\n66\n00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.170\nSo visually once we install the server app\nthings don't look very different at all.\n\n67\n00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.550\nRight, things look pretty much the same.\n\n68\n00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.760\nAnd once it's installed even\nthough I say we're now a server\n\n69\n00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.710\nyou still technically not a server.\n\n70\n00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.590\nNot until you run the app the first time.\n\n71\n00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.930\nWhen you run the application, that's when\nit starts to turn on the services and\n\n72\n00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.230\nget things configured and\nyou really become a server.\n\n73\n00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.930\nSo just having the OS X\nserver app installed,\n\n74\n00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.150\nwhat I'm doing right here,\nthat's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n75\n00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.330\nThat gets you setup to have the files for\nit, but\n\n76\n00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.770\nthen you've got to launch it one time.\n\n77\n00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.572\nTo start the actual server install.\n\n78\n00:03:33.572 --> 00:03:37.750\n>> All right now Don with the upgrade\nprocess should I go grab a coffee.\n\n79\n00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.860\nWe gonna be in for a long journey here.\n\n80\n00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.300\nIs it supposed to be a three hour tour?\n\n81\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.750\nHow long's this gonna take?\n\n82\n00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.310\n>> That kinda the nice part of it is\nit is just installing an app, right?\n\n83\n00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.360\nAnd the app's not even that big.\n\n84\n00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.030\nDoes it tell us the size.\n\n85\n00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.100\nIt's 186 megs.\n\n86\n00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.610\nSo it's downloading just\na whooping 186 Megs of data, and\n\n87\n00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.580\nonce that's done, it's already done.\n\n88\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.540\nIt happens pretty quick.\n\n89\n00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.380\nI guess that if you have a slow internet\nconnection, that might take longer,\n\n90\n00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.160\nbut it installs pretty quick.\n\n91\n00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.230\nIt's not like a lot\nthe other systems out there,\n\n92\n00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.430\nwhere you gotta run through this long and\ntedious process.\n\n93\n00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.810\nIt's done,\nI've got the server up I'm now a server.\n\n94\n00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.120\nWell it was sort of right.\n\n95\n00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.970\nI'm not really a server\ntill I run the app.\n\n96\n00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.350\nOne time,\nI've got to fire it up at least once.\n\n97\n00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.490\nTo be able to get that going.\n\n98\n00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.210\nAnd when I fire up that server app,\nI'm gonna be in business.\n\n99\n00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.020\nOkay, now before I do that there's\none thing I kinda forgot to do.\n\n100\n00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.010\nWe talked about but\nI didn't actually do it.\n\n101\n00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.230\nWhich now I'm starting to forget was it\nin the last episode or this episode but.\n\n102\n00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.520\nWe talk about having dedicated\nstorage space for the server app.\n\n103\n00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.550\nI don't have to, I can fire this\nthing up right now and go at it.\n\n104\n00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.490\nBut I wanna have an extra\nhard drive available where I\n\n105\n00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.310\ncan move my data over to.\n\n106\n00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.570\nSo I just happen to have an extra\nhard drive in this system,\n\n107\n00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.570\nI just haven't gotten it ready yet.\n\n108\n00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.910\nSo let's do that real quick.\n\n109\n00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.430\nI'm gonna jump into my Disk Utility and\n\n110\n00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.640\nI've got an extra hard\ndrive stuck on here.\n\n111\n00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.120\nIt's a virtual machine, so\nit's easy to stick on extra hard drives.\n\n112\n00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.150\nSo I've got a 64 gig drive.\n\n113\n00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.040\nThat's plenty, and honestly,\n\n114\n00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.080\nI've got enough space in my\nregular hard drive to do it too.\n\n115\n00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.100\nBut just note, this is an easy\nchange to make in the beginning.\n\n116\n00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.370\nIt's a tedious change to make later on.\n\n117\n00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.070\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\njust get this hard drive set up.\n\n118\n00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.230\nSo I'm gonna call this my Storage drive.\n\n119\n00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.660\nAnd I'll do that\nOS X Extended [Journaled],\n\n120\n00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.850\nGUID Partition Map, just the defaults.\n\n121\n00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.640\nI don't need to change those.\n\n122\n00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.620\nAnd we'll erase that so that we'll\nhave that disk available for us, okay?\n\n123\n00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.480\nAnd I don't Wanna use that for\nTime Machine backup.\n\n124\n00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.500\nNow, I chose Don't Use for\nTime Machine Backup.\n\n125\n00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.520\nThat's talking about Time Machine for\nthis server.\n\n126\n00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.240\nI can still use it for\nthe network Time Machine, right?\n\n127\n00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.730\nSo, I can still be a Time Machine\nserver and store them on that drive.\n\n128\n00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.640\ni'm not ruling that out.\n\n129\n00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.670\nI'm just saying, I don't wanna\nback the server up to that drive.\n\n130\n00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.350\nSo, I'll go ahead and turn that off.\n\n131\n00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.640\nSo now, I'm good to go, and\nwe can fire up the app.\n\n132\n00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.400\nNow, I can open the app right from here.\n\n133\n00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.900\nOr I can browse in my hard drive and\nit is in the applications folder,\n\n134\n00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.580\njust like everything else.\n\n135\n00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.280\nSo when I look at the applications folder,\nsomewhere in here,\n\n136\n00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.690\nI'll find that server icon, right?.\n\n137\n00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.795\nThat's the server app and if I do a little\nget info on it you can see this version\n\n138\n00:05:56.795 --> 00:06:01.435\n5.1 just like the app store was telling\nwhich why I had to update to 10.11.4.\n\n139\n00:06:01.435 --> 00:06:02.110\nRight.\n\n140\n00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.520\nNow Just installing the app is enough,\nI think I've said that 20 times now.\n\n141\n00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.070\nIf I jump into my terminal what's\ngoing to happen is when the server\n\n142\n00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.630\nruns a lot of the services\nalready exist in the background.\n\n143\n00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:20.680\nBut when it runs it's gonna start putting\nsome things here in my library folder.\n\n144\n00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.270\nSo I just navigated into slash library.\n\n145\n00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.600\nAnd inside of there if I look I do\nnot have a folder called Server.\n\n146\n00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.360\nRight?\n\n147\n00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.030\nThe first time I run the server app\nit's gonna initialize the services and\n\n148\n00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.110\nit'll create a new folder in here.\n\n149\n00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.420\nI'll have slash library slash server and\nthat's where I'll be able to see\n\n150\n00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.370\nthe configuration files and all the other\nthings that are tied to the server app\n\n151\n00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.330\nitself so\nI can tell it hasn't been run yet.\n\n152\n00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.805\nBecause that folder doesn't exist.\n\n153\n00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:49.028\nRight, so I haven't run the server app,\ntechnically I've got the UI.\n\n154\n00:06:49.028 --> 00:06:50.360\nRight?\nAnd that's important cuz\n\n155\n00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.160\nwe're gonna talk about role\nmanagement in another episode.\n\n156\n00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.800\nMaybe this is my laptop and\nI don't want my laptop to be a server.\n\n157\n00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.380\nI want to be able to manage other servers.\n\n158\n00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.860\nWell you still install the server\napp cuz that's the GUI.\n\n159\n00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.700\nBut then you connect to other people\ninstead of running the services on your\n\n160\n00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.830\nown system.\n\n161\n00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.550\n>> Now Don when you installed the server\napp you've already mentioned that it\n\n162\n00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.580\ngives you the access to the GUI and\nyou said some other components.\n\n163\n00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.710\nNow I've got a question because\nin some of the other systems that\n\n164\n00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.160\nI've seen specifically like Windows you\nhad to have things like installation media\n\n165\n00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.040\nsay down the road you decide okay well I'm\nnot gonna be a DNS server right now but\n\n166\n00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.020\ntomorrow I might want a DNS Is\nthis something we have\n\n167\n00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.550\nto go find installation media.\n\n168\n00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.820\nDo we have to connect back to the app\nstore to get those added components, or\n\n169\n00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.270\ndid that come over here with the server?\n\n170\n00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.760\n>> It's all right there in the server app.\n\n171\n00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.790\nSo if you were to drill down inside of the\nserver.app file it's just a folder, and\n\n172\n00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.610\ninside of that it's got all\nthe framework files needed for\n\n173\n00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.080\nevery service whether you use them or not.\n\n174\n00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.960\nAnd when you choose to use them,\n\n175\n00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.410\nthat's when they start getting split\nout of that app, and run separately.\n\n176\n00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.490\nSo they copy back and\nforth from within the server app itself.\n\n177\n00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:56.914\nRight.\nThe server app doesn't\n\n178\n00:07:56.914 --> 00:07:59.706\nhave the same sandboxing\nrequirements of a normal app.\n\n179\n00:07:59.706 --> 00:08:01.457\nBecause it's Apple approved,\nthey developed it,\n\n180\n00:08:01.457 --> 00:08:02.783\nthey can do whatever they want with it.\n\n181\n00:08:02.783 --> 00:08:04.612\nSo it's able to move that stuff back and\nforth,\n\n182\n00:08:04.612 --> 00:08:07.363\nbut you only have to download it once,\nthere's not hunting for files.\n\n183\n00:08:07.363 --> 00:08:09.280\nAll right, so enough talking about it,\nlet's fire this thing up.\n\n184\n00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.490\nSo I'm gonna launch the server app.\n\n185\n00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.850\nNow the first time I launch it,\nI see this screen right here and\n\n186\n00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:18.430\nit's just telling me to set up OS X\nserver on this Mac, click Continue.\n\n187\n00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:23.510\nAnd I don't have a whole lot of choices,\nbut there's Other Mac that I can choose.\n\n188\n00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.270\nIf this is my laptop and I wanna remote\nmanage another server somewhere else,\n\n189\n00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.470\nI wanna choose Other Mac.\n\n190\n00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.190\nI don't want my laptop to be the server.\n\n191\n00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.830\nI want to connect to somebody else, right.\n\n192\n00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.170\nBut if you choose Continue,\nyou're going to become the server.\n\n193\n00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:40.470\nNow I'll tell you guys, my laptop here,\nmy desktop at home, they're all servers.\n\n194\n00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.569\n[LAUGH] I install this and\nuse it on all of them.\n\n195\n00:08:42.569 --> 00:08:43.091\n>> Overachiever.\n\n196\n00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:47.340\n>> I know it, but it's because I'm\na network admin, it's what I do.\n\n197\n00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:51.098\nBut for your average user you don't want\nthe server app running on your system.\n\n198\n00:08:51.098 --> 00:08:54.920\nYou don't wanna accidentally weaken the\nsecurity on your system because you were\n\n199\n00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.740\nrunning a server you didn't know about and\nso you weren't updating and\n\n200\n00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.560\nprotecting it and all that.\n\n201\n00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.880\nYou don't wanna risk that.\n\n202\n00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.140\nSo you'd wanna make sure you\nchose that Other Mac but\n\n203\n00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.250\nI'm gonna choose Continue because\nI do want this to be a server.\n\n204\n00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.480\nI'll have to agree to\nthe licensing agreement, and\n\n205\n00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.930\nwhen I do that, now it's prompting me for\nadministrative credentials.\n\n206\n00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.570\nNow I have to be an administrator\nbecause it's about to modify my system.\n\n207\n00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.430\nIt's about to turn me into a server.\n\n208\n00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.980\nSo right here, Server is being set up\non this Mac, it's getting host names,\n\n209\n00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.770\nit's copying files,\nit's turning on services.\n\n210\n00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.490\nI'm now becoming a true server.\n\n211\n00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.660\nAll right,\nI was just a regular Mac OS 10 machine,\n\n212\n00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.480\nnow I'm a Mac OS 10 server and\nwe can start turning things on.\n\n213\n00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.110\nDoesn't mean I'm actually\nrunning any services.\n\n214\n00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.640\nIt's setting up the services,\nI am a server, but\n\n215\n00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.390\nI'm not running the services yet.\n\n216\n00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.660\nWe turn those on and off ourselves, right.\n\n217\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.390\nSo preparing the web service,\npreparing the calendar service,\n\n218\n00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.400\npreparing each of these\ndifferent services.\n\n219\n00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.170\nThis is it, copying all those files in\nthe background and getting them set up.\n\n220\n00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.460\nThe files are all inside\nof the server app but\n\n221\n00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.060\nthey're just not available\nright out of the box.\n\n222\n00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.350\nSo now, if I go into /Library and\n\n223\n00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.310\nI take a look,\nI got a nice new shiny folder right here.\n\n224\n00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:08.880\nServer and if I go inside of that\nServer folder, that I can't spell,\n\n225\n00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:15.630\nand looking here, I've got Web, Wiki,\nProfileManager, Firewall, Configuration,\n\n226\n00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:20.550\nLogs, all of these different folders that\nare tied to the services on my system.\n\n227\n00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:21.700\nDo I want a mail server?\n\n228\n00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.770\nIf I do,\nhere is where all its data's gonna go.\n\n229\n00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.720\nDo I want a messages server, right?\n\n230\n00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.700\nProfileManager, Wiki, Web,\neach of these have their own folder, and\n\n231\n00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.360\nthat's where their configurations and\nsometimes their binary files reside.\n\n232\n00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.080\nNot always, the binary files are typically\ninside of the server app itself.\n\n233\n00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.680\nBut sometimes they can end up here, too.\n\n234\n00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.440\nSo each of these are being created right\nnow while that runs in the background.\n\n235\n00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.180\nSo if I just sit here and\n\n236\n00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:45.110\nkeep doing the list, we'll start to see\nmore appear as it adds other things.\n\n237\n00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.106\nAnd as you configure the services,\nnow just because there's a mail folder,\n\n238\n00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:50.050\ndoesn't mean I'm running a mail server.\n\n239\n00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.790\nMail server is turned off by default.\n\n240\n00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.710\nSo is the web server,\nthe software update server.\n\n241\n00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:54.730\nThey're all turned off by default.\n\n242\n00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.400\nWe have to turn on the ones that we want.\n\n243\n00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:03.170\nAnd if I go back here and check out my\nserver app, I now see this screen, right?\n\n244\n00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.040\nThis is the main dashboard for\nthe server app.\n\n245\n00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.500\nSo once it runs, once it activates your\nsystem, you'll see this screen right here.\n\n246\n00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:16.410\nAnd what you're seeing is, along the left\nside, information about the server itself\n\n247\n00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:21.530\nfollowed by user and group configurations,\nand then the services.\n\n248\n00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.480\nAnd as you look down the services,\nany one that has a green dot by it,\n\n249\n00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.020\nis one that's turned on and running.\n\n250\n00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.070\nOkay, which one's have a green dot?\n\n251\n00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.080\n>> Not a single one.\n\n252\n00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.240\n>> Yeah, they're all off, right?\n\n253\n00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.480\nSo even though I'm a server,\nI'm not actually running any services yet.\n\n254\n00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.920\nAnd so these are all the services I can\nturn on, cache and calendar, and so on.\n\n255\n00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.020\nAnd then there's even some advanced\nones that are hidden by default,\n\n256\n00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.270\nand if you hit that show link,\nyou'll see the advanced ones for\n\n257\n00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.340\nthe full list of servers that we can run,\nright.\n\n258\n00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.040\nThese are all the different things that\nare inside of the server app that we can\n\n259\n00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.440\ndo, right.\n\n260\n00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.720\nWe're gonna do a lot of episodes that\ncover each one of these as we go through.\n\n261\n00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.660\nWe've got a whole series ahead of us but\n\n262\n00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.970\nlet me just do a quick kind of skim by\nto identify what all these are, right.\n\n263\n00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.350\nSo starting right here with caching.\n\n264\n00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.170\nCaching and software update server,\nthose two, where's software update,\n\n265\n00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.550\nway down here, this guy.\n\n266\n00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.190\nThose two are really closely related and\nwe talked about those in the other\n\n267\n00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.180\ncertification, you should\nalready know about those.\n\n268\n00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.450\nCaching says if one MAC downloads a file,\nnobody else should have to download it,\n\n269\n00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.090\nthey can get it right\nhere from the server.\n\n270\n00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.100\nWe cache a copy of it,\nwe make it available.\n\n271\n00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.830\nAll of your software updates,\nyour apps from the app store,\n\n272\n00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.480\nvideos purchased through iTunes,\nmusic and so on, are all cached here.\n\n273\n00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.420\nSo if one person downloads it everybody\ncan get it from the cache instead\n\n274\n00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.180\nof eating up Internet bandwidth.\n\n275\n00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.773\nSoftware update is similar but\nfor software updates,\n\n276\n00:12:37.773 --> 00:12:43.013\nnot app store purchases, not music and\nvideos just your application updates.\n\n277\n00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:44.444\nNot even application updates,\n\n278\n00:12:44.444 --> 00:12:47.930\nit's your operating system updates\nreally that are a part of that.\n\n279\n00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.930\nNow when they get downloaded here, other\npeople can download it and we can pick and\n\n280\n00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.330\nchoose which ones we want\nto allow people to have.\n\n281\n00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.270\nSome update to Safari might come out that\nwe don't want to roll out on our networks.\n\n282\n00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.300\nWe can disable that update.\n\n283\n00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.530\nYou can pick and choose.\n\n284\n00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.600\nWith a caching server you can't.\n\n285\n00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:02.608\nWe've got Calendar.\n\n286\n00:13:02.608 --> 00:13:07.420\nIf I wanna have collaboration, right, so a\nlot of businesses use collaboration suites\n\n287\n00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.003\nwhere you have email, calendar,\ncontacts, and chat, right?\n\n288\n00:13:11.003 --> 00:13:14.280\nSo people can talk, they can send\nemails back and forth, they can chat,\n\n289\n00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.540\ndo realtime chat.\n\n290\n00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.620\nThey have a contact list where they\ncan see everybody in the company.\n\n291\n00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.590\nAll of that is part of collaboration.\n\n292\n00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:25.020\nAnd so we have Calendar,\nContacts, Mail, and Messages.\n\n293\n00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.422\nThose four together create\na full collaboration suite so\n\n294\n00:13:27.422 --> 00:13:28.440\nthat we can function.\n\n295\n00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.090\nI skipped right over file sharing.\n\n296\n00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.290\nFile sharing is very similar to the file\nsharing built into your OS by default\n\n297\n00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.870\nexcept here,\nwe have a little bit more that we can do.\n\n298\n00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.350\nWe can tweak whether people's\nhome directories are available or\n\n299\n00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:44.570\nother directories, you can set permissions\nand you can even set IP restrictions.\n\n300\n00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.800\nYou can't normally set IP restrictions\nwith regular file sharing but\n\n301\n00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.340\nyou can do it here in the server sharing,\nso, kind of an advanced file sharing.\n\n302\n00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.050\nLet's see, we've got Profile Manager.\n\n303\n00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.850\nI know we've covered that in some\nof the earlier certification shows.\n\n304\n00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.170\nBut if you haven't heard of it,\n\n305\n00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:02.580\nif you have a configuration you want\nto apply to a Mac, you can do that.\n\n306\n00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.775\nBut then somebody can just go and\nundo the changes.\n\n307\n00:14:04.775 --> 00:14:07.755\nProfile manager lets us force\na configuration on a Mac.\n\n308\n00:14:07.755 --> 00:14:10.415\nNow it's set up a particular way and\npeople can't change it.\n\n309\n00:14:10.415 --> 00:14:14.055\nIt's great for labs or\nenvironments where you have students or\n\n310\n00:14:14.055 --> 00:14:16.225\nother people using computers and\nthey tend to mess things up.\n\n311\n00:14:17.385 --> 00:14:21.745\nThe Time Machine backup, if I want to have\na centralized Time Machine server where\n\n312\n00:14:21.745 --> 00:14:23.620\neverybody's backups go to, so\n\n313\n00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.620\nI don't wanna issue people\nindividual backup hard drives.\n\n314\n00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.720\nI want it all in one place,\nI can set up a Time Machine server.\n\n315\n00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.710\nThis is effectively what\nApple's AirPort does.\n\n316\n00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:34.600\nWhen you have the Time Capsule or an\nAirPort with hard drives attached to it,\n\n317\n00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.240\nit's a network Time Machine server.\n\n318\n00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.483\nI can set it up right here.\nI can make this machine\n\n319\n00:14:37.483 --> 00:14:38.692\na network Time Machine server.\n\n320\n00:14:38.692 --> 00:14:42.787\nVPN, if I wanna allow people to build\nan encrypted virtual private network\n\n321\n00:14:42.787 --> 00:14:46.037\nconnection from the outside\nworld to my internal network,\n\n322\n00:14:46.037 --> 00:14:48.870\nI can build up a VPN server,\ndo it right from here.\n\n323\n00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.990\nIf I wanna be a web server,\n\n324\n00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.820\nthere's actually two different\nweb servers, Websites and Wiki.\n\n325\n00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.890\nWebsites are for\nyour standard type website.\n\n326\n00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:00.600\nSomebody develops a web page, just stick\non the server, people can view it.\n\n327\n00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.980\nWikis are different.\n\n328\n00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.480\nWikis are webpages that people can edit,\nright?\n\n329\n00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.235\nThink like Wikipedia, people can browse to\nit, and if they see something that's not\n\n330\n00:15:07.235 --> 00:15:09.930\nright, or they wanna add more information,\nthey can edit the page and add it to it.\n\n331\n00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:13.280\nSo it's just a web server\nthat allows modifications.\n\n332\n00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.340\nSo those two are actually\ntied to the same service.\n\n333\n00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:21.040\nXcode, if you're a development house, you\nhave people that are writing iOS apps or\n\n334\n00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.960\nOS X apps They can write it, but\n\n335\n00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.790\nhow do you keep the source code\ncommon amongst all the developers?\n\n336\n00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.280\nIf one person makes a change, how do\nyou make sure everyone else sees it?\n\n337\n00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.960\nYou can set up a centralized\nXcode server and\n\n338\n00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.490\nnow you've got a place where you can store\nall of your code and track revisions,\n\n339\n00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:39.889\nroll back and do deployments and so\non, all from one central location.\n\n340\n00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.140\nUnder the Advanced side,\nthis is where the fun stuff is, right?\n\n341\n00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.740\nRemember the first episode I talk about\ndynamic IP addresses, and how you want\n\n342\n00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.170\nyour server to have a static address so\nits IP address is always the same.\n\n343\n00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.500\nBut in a dynamic world\nyou use a DHCP server,\n\n344\n00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.110\ndynamic host configuration protocol.\n\n345\n00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.823\nThat's what hands out IP addresses.\n\n346\n00:15:56.823 --> 00:16:00.799\nSo we could be that server, we could\nbe the one handing out the addresses.\n\n347\n00:16:00.799 --> 00:16:05.227\nDNS, domain name system This is\nwhere we resolve a name to an IP or\n\n348\n00:16:05.227 --> 00:16:07.206\nvice versa, an IP to a name.\n\n349\n00:16:07.206 --> 00:16:11.169\nWhen you browse the web and you type in\nwww.apple.com, in the background your\n\n350\n00:16:11.169 --> 00:16:14.610\ncomputer changes that to an IP address and\ngoes to that address.\n\n351\n00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:16.615\nDNS does it We can be a DNS server.\n\n352\n00:16:17.645 --> 00:16:19.975\nFTP is for file transfer protocol.\n\n353\n00:16:19.975 --> 00:16:23.955\nNormally we use file sharing which uses\nApple file protocol or SMB, server message\n\n354\n00:16:23.955 --> 00:16:28.665\nblock, but we can use FTP, file transfer\nprotocol, to transfer them also.\n\n355\n00:16:28.665 --> 00:16:30.135\nFTP is not secure.\n\n356\n00:16:30.135 --> 00:16:31.125\nSo we don't typically use it.\n\n357\n00:16:31.125 --> 00:16:34.975\nInstead, we use SFTP, which is actually\ntied to the secure shell protocol.\n\n358\n00:16:34.975 --> 00:16:36.369\nWe'll see that in another episode.\n\n359\n00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.040\nNet install.\n\n360\n00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.390\nIf you haven't done it,\nwe did one of the ACA,\n\n361\n00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:46.680\nApple Certified Associate shows and\nit was on Mac management basics.\n\n362\n00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.830\nIt's not required for this certification,\nyou can get your ACTC without it but\n\n363\n00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.860\nI really recommend you jump back and\nwatch that show because we run through net\n\n364\n00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:57.080\ninstall and all the different ways that\nyou can create prebuilt Mac images\n\n365\n00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.120\nto roll out to your machine so\nthey've got a consistent install base.\n\n366\n00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.480\nWe'll see a little more\nof it in this show.\n\n367\n00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.410\nBut we did a really deep dive\ninto it in the ACA show.\n\n368\n00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.560\nDefinitely a good one to check out.\n\n369\n00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:08.050\nOpen Directory.\n\n370\n00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:11.140\nThat's a centralized\ndatabase of user accounts.\n\n371\n00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:15.200\nIf I have 100 Macs I don't wanna have\nto have a user account on all 100 macs.\n\n372\n00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.900\nIf I change my password I'd go to all\n100 of them to change the password.\n\n373\n00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.050\nIt'd be nice to have it all in one place.\n\n374\n00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.990\nAn Open Directory lets us do that.\n\n375\n00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:24.600\nNow Don,\nyou jumped back to the CLI there, and\n\n376\n00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.830\nwhen you showing us that the server\ndirectory wasn't there until you installed\n\n377\n00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.580\nthe software,\nI did kind of notice something there.\n\n378\n00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.380\nAn open directory was already present\ninside of your files and folders, or\n\n379\n00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.440\nin your directories,\nbefore you installed the server.\n\n380\n00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.720\nWhat would be the difference between here,\nand what we've seen beforehand?\n\n381\n00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.240\n>> All right so\nwe're talking client versus server Right?\n\n382\n00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.460\nSo, every Mac is an open directory client.\n\n383\n00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.520\nAny Mac can join an open directory so\nyou've already got some configuration for\n\n384\n00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.740\nthat, right?\n\n385\n00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.710\nBut to be a server, that's different.\n\n386\n00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.400\nAnd so you actually end up\nwith two open directories,\n\n387\n00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.870\none that's just straight up in library and\none that's in slash library slash server.\n\n388\n00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.900\nBecause you're becoming the open\ndirectory server, and it's kind of funny.\n\n389\n00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.000\nWhen you build an open directory server,\nyou're a client and a server.\n\n390\n00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.900\nYou're a client of your own directory so\nit kind of Loops back on itself.\n\n391\n00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.600\nIt's a little weird.\n\n392\n00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.610\nSo that's why you my see that.\n\n393\n00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.050\nAnd there's a few spots that were like\nthat where you can see some duplication.\n\n394\n00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.690\nAlright the last two that we've got\nthe software update I already talked about\n\n395\n00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:17.240\nthat one, right?\n\n396\n00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.880\nSo cashing the software updates.\n\n397\n00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.560\nAnd then Xsan.\n\n398\n00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.080\nXsan is if you have one of those nice,\nbig,\n\n399\n00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.840\nexpensive storage appliances, and you\nwant more than one Mac connected to it.\n\n400\n00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.100\nWell two devices can't write to\nthe same data at the same time,\n\n401\n00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.230\nyou get data corruption.\n\n402\n00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:36.400\nSo Xsan handles negotiating that traffic\nso that one server if it's writing data,\n\n403\n00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.420\na second server will wait for\nthe first one to finish before it writes.\n\n404\n00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.960\nSo they take turns and\nit likes a traffic cop for storage.\n\n405\n00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.890\nNow, we're seeing this one go away, and\n\n406\n00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:48.470\nthe reason is, network speeds\nhave really been increasing.\n\n407\n00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.890\n10 gig networks are really\ncommon these days, and so\n\n408\n00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:54.450\nwe don't necessarily have a need for\nthat direct attach SAN like we used to.\n\n409\n00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:56.630\nBut there are still plenty of\nenvironments that do it, and\n\n410\n00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.810\nXSAN is the protocol that drives it.\n\n411\n00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.340\nSo those are all the different\nservices that are available, but\n\n412\n00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.600\nkey thing to remember,\nthey're all turned off I have to go and\n\n413\n00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.140\nturn on the ones that I want, to get them\nenabled, and get them up and running.\n\n414\n00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.630\nThat's what the whole rest of\nthis series is gonna be about.\n\n415\n00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.160\n>> Don, when we first started, you said\nthere was some things that you need to\n\n416\n00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.130\nhave available before you\neven install the server.\n\n417\n00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:19.270\nYou said, your static IP address,\nwe have to have.\n\n418\n00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:22.470\nI notice you changed the computer name,\nbefore you even installed the server.\n\n419\n00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:26.120\nAre there any other types of\nmaybe post installation services?\n\n420\n00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.770\nMinus the services that maybe you\njust showed us that we wanna turn on.\n\n421\n00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.700\nAre there any like generalized post\ninstallation tasks that we have to do?\n\n422\n00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.650\n>> Well the only other one that I\nhaven't done so far is storage.\n\n423\n00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.930\nRight I mentioned now it's best to\nmove the storage ahead of time.\n\n424\n00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:41.180\nThen later on when you've\nactually got data in it.\n\n425\n00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.400\nSo right now it's setting my system up\nto use slash library slash server as\n\n426\n00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.210\nit's storage.\n\n427\n00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:49.420\nSo if I spin up an open directory or\na mail server or\n\n428\n00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.970\na time machine backup, it's all going\ninto slash library slash server.\n\n429\n00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.860\nWell that's my Macintosh hard drive.\n\n430\n00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.330\nI'm gonna run out of storage there.\n\n431\n00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.220\nSo I need to move that.\n\n432\n00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.570\nAnd moving it now is best, because it's\nempty right now, it's easy to move.\n\n433\n00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.180\nSo let me show you guys that.\n\n434\n00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.820\nHere inside of the server app,\nI'm back on the dashboard so\n\n435\n00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.170\nup top I just clicked on the server name.\n\n436\n00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:11.765\nAnd you'll see a couple of\ntabs across the top here.\n\n437\n00:20:11.765 --> 00:20:12.850\nI'm on the overview, and so\n\n438\n00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.870\nit's just showing me some basic\ninformation about my system.\n\n439\n00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:17.620\nWell you have a storage tab.\n\n440\n00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:21.280\nThe storage tab, it's useful when\nwe talk about file sharing, but for\n\n441\n00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.560\nthis it's not terribly useful.\n\n442\n00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.510\nIt's just showing me that\nI've got two hard drives.\n\n443\n00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:26.500\nAnd I can see how much space is available.\n\n444\n00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.830\nBut you don't really have\na whole lot of options here.\n\n445\n00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:32.260\nIf I go down and look at my options, you\ncan see I can Propagate Permissions and\n\n446\n00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.390\nthat's it.\n\n447\n00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:37.720\nIf I want to change my default storage,\nthere's two places I can do it.\n\n448\n00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.600\nOne is right here under Settings.\n\n449\n00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.160\nUnder Settings, you've got the default\nlocation for service data.\n\n450\n00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.690\nAnd the default is Macintosh HD and\n\n451\n00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:50.310\nthat means slash server, I'm sorry\nslash library, slash server, right?\n\n452\n00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:51.760\nThat's what's gonna use my default.\n\n453\n00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.180\nAnd I can change the location,\nI can move it somewhere else.\n\n454\n00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.560\nThis will move all of the services.\n\n455\n00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.600\nOkay?\n\n456\n00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.520\nSome of the service, not all of them, but\n\n457\n00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.960\nsome of the services allow you to move\ntheir location within the service itself.\n\n458\n00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.510\nSo, if I come over here and\nlook at something like the cashing server,\n\n459\n00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.630\nUnder the caching server,\nhere's my cache location.\n\n460\n00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.370\nI can move just the cache.\n\n461\n00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.000\nAnd all the other services\nwill stay on Macintosh HD.\n\n462\n00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:21.490\nBut not everyone does it.\n\n463\n00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.490\nSo for example, if I go down to\nsoftware update, software update,\n\n464\n00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.680\nvery similar to caching server except\nthey didn't include that option.\n\n465\n00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.340\nIf I look under my Settings, there's no\noption here to move where that's stored.\n\n466\n00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.990\nSo for the ones that don't\nhave a specific option,\n\n467\n00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:35.900\nthe global setting is the only\none that's available.\n\n468\n00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.360\nSo I always start with that.\n\n469\n00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.820\nI go right under Settings and I move it.\n\n470\n00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.680\nNow right now if I look at my\nstorage hard drive it's empty.\n\n471\n00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.440\nThere's nothing in there, right?\n\n472\n00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.270\nBut I'm gonna come here to my service data\nand I'm gonna change that location and\n\n473\n00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.400\nI'm gonna pick that storage hard drive.\n\n474\n00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.380\nSo when I choose that this is gonna change\n\n475\n00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.750\nit's gonna warn me here that's\nit's gonna have to move data.\n\n476\n00:21:55.750 --> 00:22:00.130\nIf I have a lot of data I'm gonna hit\nokay and my services are gonna stop and\n\n477\n00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.530\nthen it's gonna slowly move that\ndata over it could be down for\n\n478\n00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.560\nhours while it moves and\nthen starts back up.\n\n479\n00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.590\nWell actually I hit an error.\n\n480\n00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:08.740\nI forgot something.\n\n481\n00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.240\nSo if you have removable storage\n\n482\n00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.730\nremovable storage has this little\nsetting called ignore permissions.\n\n483\n00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:18.330\nRemovable storage can move from\ncomputer to computer to computer.\n\n484\n00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:21.660\nSo if you have an owner set on the file,\nthe owner might exist on one system and\n\n485\n00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.990\nnot exist on another,\nthat's gonna cause a problem, right?\n\n486\n00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:28.020\nSo, Apple turns this ignore\npermissions thing on by default.\n\n487\n00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.670\nAnd so that's on for mine.\n\n488\n00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:32.280\nWell, it's not gonna let me move the\nserver over there because it's gonna cause\n\n489\n00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.120\nsome problems.\n\n490\n00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.480\nSo, I need to go in and undue that option.\n\n491\n00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.240\nSo, I'm gonna take my extra storage and\nI'll do a get info on it and\n\n492\n00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.510\nway down at the bottom of get info\nyou've got sharing and permissions And\n\n493\n00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:46.680\nunder that, you'll see the permissions\nthat are tied to the drive.\n\n494\n00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:52.380\nAnd at the very bottom, there's\nIgnore ownership, really hard to see.\n\n495\n00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.320\nLight gray text on\na light gray background.\n\n496\n00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.120\nIt's almost like they\nintend it to be invisible.\n\n497\n00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.310\nWell, that's really cause it's locked.\n\n498\n00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:00.580\nIf I unlock it,\nlet me just punch in my password.\n\n499\n00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.030\nThere we go.\n\n500\n00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.420\nNow at least it's lit up.\n\n501\n00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.090\nAnd you can see that Ignore\npermissions is turned on.\n\n502\n00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:07.450\nI'm going to turn that off.\n\n503\n00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:11.300\nAnd as soon as I turned that off, now it's\npaying attention to who the owner is.\n\n504\n00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:12.900\nAnd I should be able to move\nover to that without problems.\n\n505\n00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.770\nSo I'm going to go ahead and move it.\n\n506\n00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:17.410\nAnd it's warning me the services\nare going to be stopped.\n\n507\n00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.580\nI don't care because none\nof my services are on.\n\n508\n00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.090\nI'm not causing an interruption.\n\n509\n00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.250\nSo I can say it's going to move it.\n\n510\n00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.460\nIf I was actually using\nthe services they go offline.\n\n511\n00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.440\nIt copies all that stuff over,\nit gets everything set up.\n\n512\n00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.390\nI could have hours of downtime here.\n\n513\n00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:33.160\nThat's what you wanna avoid.\n\n514\n00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.200\nBy moving it now I avoid downtime later.\n\n515\n00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.960\nAnd once that's done then\n\n516\n00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.790\nwhat I'll see is if I browse to my storage\ndrive it now has a library folder.\n\n517\n00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.930\nAnd inside of Library,\nI'll have a server folder.\n\n518\n00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:49.770\nAnd inside of that, here's all the\ndifferent things that are getting moved\n\n519\n00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.130\nover to it, mail, wiki, web, and so on.\n\n520\n00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.670\nAll these are getting copied over.\n\n521\n00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:56.430\nAll right, once that's done.\n\n522\n00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:57.370\nThere we go, now it's done.\n\n523\n00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:59.906\nI see my location is set to storage,\nI'm ready to go.\n\n524\n00:23:59.906 --> 00:24:01.067\nThis box is set up.\n\n525\n00:24:01.067 --> 00:24:03.885\nI can start installing,\nconfiguring services, and\n\n526\n00:24:03.885 --> 00:24:07.149\nall the other things I want to do\nto get this one up and running.\n\n527\n00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:10.565\nNow one thing I definitely wanted to\nshow you guys was what happens during\n\n528\n00:24:10.565 --> 00:24:13.600\nan upgrade, cuz an upgrade's\na little bit different, right?\n\n529\n00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.516\nHere, this was a straight up install.\n\n530\n00:24:14.516 --> 00:24:17.636\nOn an upgrade, we've got to migrate data\nfrom the old version of the server to\n\n531\n00:24:17.636 --> 00:24:20.235\nthe new version of the server,\nand it's actually pretty easy.\n\n532\n00:24:20.235 --> 00:24:23.206\nSo I've got another system setup\nwhere we can see that, and\n\n533\n00:24:23.206 --> 00:24:24.646\nwalk through that process.\n\n534\n00:24:24.646 --> 00:24:28.000\nSo if we take a look at this system,\nwhat I've got here is this a machine that\n\n535\n00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.090\nwas running Yosemite this morning and\nI've upgraded it to El Capitan.\n\n536\n00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:37.190\nSo it was running 10.10, I just did\nthe regular Mac upgrade to 10.11.\n\n537\n00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:41.880\nThe difference between this and like the\nother system I've been using in the show,\n\n538\n00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.030\nis that this one was running\nthe server app prior to the upgrade.\n\n539\n00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:48.290\nI had already installed the server app and\nI had already been using it,\n\n540\n00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:52.830\nturn on some services or whatever, and\nnow I've done the upgrade to El Capitan.\n\n541\n00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.280\nNow when you do this,\n\n542\n00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.470\nthe first thing you'll notice is all\nyour services are broken, right?\n\n543\n00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.910\nThings are not working, and\nit's actually really obvious.\n\n544\n00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:03.050\nLet me show you, if I browse into my\napplications folder here, when I go into\n\n545\n00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:06.980\napplications and I start looking at\napplications, look at that server icon.\n\n546\n00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.700\nThat's a little bit different\nthan on this machine.\n\n547\n00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.600\nIf I go into my applications.\n\n548\n00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.870\nOkay, look at the server icon\nhere versus the server icon here.\n\n549\n00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:20.210\nWhat's the difference?\n\n550\n00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.310\nThere's a giant slash through this one,\nright?\n\n551\n00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.810\nAnd what it's telling me is you\nare not allowed to run this.\n\n552\n00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:29.750\nI'm running the server version\nthat was made for Yosemite.\n\n553\n00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:33.220\nBut now I've upgraded to El Capitan so\nmy server is broken, all right?\n\n554\n00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.280\nI can't run this,\nall of my services are stopped.\n\n555\n00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.890\nSo when you do an upgrade, you gotta\nupgrade your operating system first.\n\n556\n00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:39.700\nThere's no way around that.\n\n557\n00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.030\nYou gotta upgrade the operating\nsystem first, and\n\n558\n00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.620\nthen you've gotta upgrade the Server app,\nalso.\n\n559\n00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:49.490\nAnd sometimes not much changes under\nthe hood, but you still have to do it.\n\n560\n00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.610\nYou've gotta upgrade the Server app.\n\n561\n00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:55.150\nSo if I just try and run this thing,\nif I double click on it or whatever,\n\n562\n00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:59.250\nit's telling me, in order to open Server I\nneed to update to the latest version,\n\n563\n00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:01.940\nand it gives me a link to take\nme right to the App Store.\n\n564\n00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.800\nSo I can jump into the App Store and\nI can do that update.\n\n565\n00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.490\nNow, the update is a little bit\nmisleading in a way, right?\n\n566\n00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:12.040\nSo here's my Server app and\nI've got a nice big update button on it.\n\n567\n00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:16.010\nI'm just gonna hit update, all right,\nso it's gonna download that update and\n\n568\n00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:20.960\napply it, after I punch in whatever\nmy password happens to be today.\n\n569\n00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.500\nWe'll try that one.\n\n570\n00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.690\nAnd.\n[LAUGH] One of these\n\n571\n00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.090\ndays I'll pick some passwords\nI can actually remember.\n\n572\n00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:28.210\nThere we go.\n\n573\n00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:29.010\nAnd shoot.\n\n574\n00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:30.700\nIt's gotta verify my identity.\n\n575\n00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.210\nSo it's gonna send me a text message.\n\n576\n00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:34.990\nGood old dual factor authentication,\nright?\n\n577\n00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:38.190\nSo we'll get that, and\nwe'll identify that.\n\n578\n00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:39.490\nAnd then it will do the update.\n\n579\n00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:43.990\nNow the part where I say it's misleading\nis not that it's trying to trick us,\n\n580\n00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:46.000\nbut I'm gonna punch this in.\n\n581\n00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.660\nIt's gonna do the update and as soon it's\ndone, it's gonna say that is done and\n\n582\n00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:53.470\nit's updated, right, so\nI can go to lunch I'm done, right?\n\n583\n00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:55.210\nBut it's not actually done.\n\n584\n00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.990\nWhat it's doing is it's\ndownloading the new Server app.\n\n585\n00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:03.497\nSo it's downloading the version\n5.1 Server app for OS 10.11.4.\n\n586\n00:27:03.497 --> 00:27:06.750\nWhen I was under Yosemite,\nI was running the 10.4 one, in fact,\n\n587\n00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.900\nI probably should have pulled up the\nproperties on that file before I did it.\n\n588\n00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.470\nMaybe I can catch it in time.\n\n589\n00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:15.080\nLet's see if I can do\na Get Info on that thing.\n\n590\n00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.040\nI was, good.\n\n591\n00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.420\nJust fast enough.\n\n592\n00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.070\nSee how it's Version 4.0.3?\n\n593\n00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:24.110\nSo its still got the version\n4 server from Yosemite.\n\n594\n00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:26.710\nSo it's going to replace that\nwith a version 5 server.\n\n595\n00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:28.700\nThat's what it's doing\nhere in the background.\n\n596\n00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.590\nIt's downloading it, installing it,\nand it's going to replace that.\n\n597\n00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:34.350\nAnd I'll know it's done because\nthe little slash is going to go away and\n\n598\n00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.147\nI'll actually see the globe it's runnable.\n\n599\n00:27:36.147 --> 00:27:44.080\nBut while it upgraded the Server app,\nit didn't upgrade the services.\n\n600\n00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:49.000\nAll of my services, DNS, open directory,\nwhatever, are still the older versions and\n\n601\n00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.930\nso they're still not running.\n\n602\n00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:56.010\nSo when you do the upgrade like this, you\nimmediately need to run the Server app.\n\n603\n00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.770\nYou gotta run it at least one\ntime from the server itself.\n\n604\n00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:01.620\nNot remote, don't go to your laptop and\ntry to run it that way.\n\n605\n00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:02.940\nIt's gotta run from the server itself.\n\n606\n00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.760\nYou can do screen sharing, and\nconnect to the screen to the server.\n\n607\n00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.580\nBut the Server app itself\nhas to run from the server.\n\n608\n00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:13.080\nAnd when you run it on the server,\nit will upgrade each of the services, and\n\n609\n00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.470\nthat's the real upgrade.\n\n610\n00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:18.980\nThis, this is just copying a 186 meg file,\nthat's all it's doing, right?\n\n611\n00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.401\nAnd once that's done, I'll run it and\n\n612\n00:28:20.401 --> 00:28:22.222\nit'll upgrade each of\nthe individual services.\n\n613\n00:28:22.222 --> 00:28:27.270\nNow the key thing to remember here is that\nwe've got downtime this whole process.\n\n614\n00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.760\nSo you normally wanna do\nthese at the same time.\n\n615\n00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.320\nI'm gonna upgrade this server, so\n\n616\n00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:36.310\nI'm going to take it offline to\ndo the upgrade to El Capitan.\n\n617\n00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:39.376\nAnd while it's offline I'll then do\nthe Server app update and finish that.\n\n618\n00:28:39.376 --> 00:28:41.885\nSo you wanna do two of them at\nthe same time, otherwise it breaks.\n\n619\n00:28:41.885 --> 00:28:44.860\nAll right, so it just finished copying.\n\n620\n00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:48.900\nAnd notice how I get a warning,\nServer app replacement detected.\n\n621\n00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.710\nServer was replaced in\nthe applications folder.\n\n622\n00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:53.160\nThe services have been stopped and\nservice data preserved.\n\n623\n00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:55.690\nIt's telling me my services are offline.\n\n624\n00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:59.070\nAnd if I look at my icon, no more slash.\n\n625\n00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:00.660\nNow it's updated.\n\n626\n00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:05.757\nAnd if I do a quick Get Info on that, I\ncan see it's version 5.1, from the 4.0.3.\n\n627\n00:29:05.757 --> 00:29:09.282\nNow the first time I run it,\nI'm gonna launch that up and\n\n628\n00:29:09.282 --> 00:29:11.770\nit's gonna ask who I wanna connect to.\n\n629\n00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:14.150\nI'm gonna connect to this Mac and\nI'll continue.\n\n630\n00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.770\nI got the license agreement again.\n\n631\n00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:19.290\nWell, it's a new license agreement for\nthe new version,\n\n632\n00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:25.150\nI've gotta agree to that and now I'll\npunch in my administrator password.\n\n633\n00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.050\nAnd now it's upgrading.\n\n634\n00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:30.709\nSee, right here, creating an identity\ncertificate, Updating services,\n\n635\n00:29:30.709 --> 00:29:32.950\nUpdating Cach, Updating Calendar.\n\n636\n00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:34.920\nNow it's actually doing the upgrade.\n\n637\n00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.350\nAnd so it's going to run through that for\neach of the services,\n\n638\n00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.820\nupgrading them to 5.1.\n\n639\n00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:44.060\nBe careful with this because unlike\na regular app, hey, if a new version of\n\n640\n00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:47.730\nPages comes out, I just swap them out,\nand it's done, it's no big deal.\n\n641\n00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:49.830\nBut with a Server app things can break.\n\n642\n00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:51.520\nThere's things that can go wrong here.\n\n643\n00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.800\nSo as soon as it's done,\nwe need to test each of our services,\n\n644\n00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.320\nand make sure they're still functional.\n\n645\n00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.850\nSometimes features can get\nmodified that breaks things so\n\n646\n00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.190\nyou gotta make sure you check all that\nout and that everything is running fine.\n\n647\n00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:02.650\nDon't just randomly apply these.\n\n648\n00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.940\nThis is not like updating\nWords With Friends, right?\n\n649\n00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.660\nOkay, so I couldn't play Scrabble today?\n\n650\n00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:11.030\nBut if the server app goes down,\nI might have hundreds or\n\n651\n00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:14.570\neven thousands of employees,\nwho can't do a time machine backup, right?\n\n652\n00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:16.110\nSo you wanna make sure\nyou do that testing.\n\n653\n00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:17.710\nSo it's gonna run through and\ndo the update.\n\n654\n00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:21.250\nNow this I find typically takes\nlonger than doing the install.\n\n655\n00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:24.820\nWhen you do the install, it's already got\na skeleton framework of the services,\n\n656\n00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.060\nit just copies over and it's done.\n\n657\n00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:29.980\nBut when you do the upgrade, it's gotta\ngo through each of the config files and\n\n658\n00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.530\nadd new settings, it's gotta\nchange permissions where needed,\n\n659\n00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:34.150\nit's gotta introduce new services.\n\n660\n00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:35.490\nIt has a lot more work to do.\n\n661\n00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:38.710\nSo this process is going to churn through,\nand oop, looks like it's done.\n\n662\n00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:43.230\nAnd as soon as that bar gets all the way\nacross like mine is, that means that all\n\n663\n00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:47.080\nthe services are updated, and\nnow it's going to start your services.\n\n664\n00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.150\nThat's what that little\npause was right there.\n\n665\n00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:53.130\nAnd now it's started, and you can see,\nI'm a DNS, and an Open Directory server.\n\n666\n00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:56.630\nI've got my little green lights lit up,\nmy service is now running.\n\n667\n00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:59.610\nPrior to that, DNS was down,\nOpen Directory was down.\n\n668\n00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:02.350\nIf Open Directory is down,\npeople can't log into their computers.\n\n669\n00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:06.520\nIf this is my only Open Directory server,\nfirst off shame on me.\n\n670\n00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.650\nYou should always have two.\n\n671\n00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:08.347\n[LAUGH] But secondly,\n\n672\n00:31:08.347 --> 00:31:10.560\nall of my employees are just sitting\nthere twiddling their thumbs.\n\n673\n00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.810\nGoing, boy, it'd be nice to log in to my\nown computer and do work, but now it's up.\n\n674\n00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:16.480\nAnd we're in business right.\n\n675\n00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.280\nIf you don't run the Server app,\nyou're logs,\n\n676\n00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.230\nlike if you go into console app you'll\nsee tones of error entries in there.\n\n677\n00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:26.820\nI get this on my laptop a lot of\nthe times, cuz I'll upgrade my laptop and\n\n678\n00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.950\nI won't run the server app cuz I\ndon't need it everyday, and so\n\n679\n00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:33.340\nI'll get a tone of junk in my\nconsole logs because I didn't do it.\n\n680\n00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.880\nSo I've got and have it hey just\nrun the Server app one time,\n\n681\n00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.180\nlet the update happen\nanytime the OS updates.\n\n682\n00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.200\nAnd that's key too,\nIt's not just major jumps here,\n\n683\n00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.840\nI went from Yosemite to El Capitan.\n\n684\n00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.551\nBut even if I go from El Capitan 10.11.3,\n\n685\n00:31:47.551 --> 00:31:53.253\nto El Capitan 10.11.4 that Server\napp 5.0 to Server app 5.1,\n\n686\n00:31:53.253 --> 00:31:57.790\nI still need to run it at least\none time from the server.\n\n687\n00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.700\nTo get that update to occur, all right?\n\n688\n00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:03.100\nBut once it's done, you'll be up and\ngoing, and now we're in business, right?\n\n689\n00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:08.120\nSo the upgrade is pretty painless,\nassuming all the services still work.\n\n690\n00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.160\n>> Lot of great information in this,\nDon, in getting these servers up and\n\n691\n00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.740\nrunning for the first time.\n\n692\n00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:17.660\nI do see that we're running about to\nthe end of another great episode here.\n\n693\n00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:21.710\nBut before we leave, Don,\nany advice for our viewers out there?\n\n694\n00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:23.980\n>> The main thing is,\ndon't be afraid of the Server app.\n\n695\n00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.700\nSuper easy to get it installed.\n\n696\n00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:28.750\nIf you have a laptop or a Mac Mini or\nwhatever, throw it on there and\n\n697\n00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:29.920\nexperiment around with it.\n\n698\n00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.530\nRemember you can install\nit on more than one machine\n\n699\n00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:32.587\nonce it's tied to your Apple ID.\n\n700\n00:32:32.587 --> 00:32:35.560\nAnd just get it installed and\nplay with it.\n\n701\n00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.780\nWhen it comes to upgrades,\nalways run through some tests and\n\n702\n00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:42.780\ndefinitely take a time machine back up of\nyour system before you do the upgrade.\n\n703\n00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:46.200\nThat way, if things really break, you can\nroll back to the time machine update.\n\n704\n00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.610\nStrange little fact here.\n\n705\n00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:51.110\nApple will let you download installers for\nprevious versions of the OS.\n\n706\n00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:54.870\nThey won't let you download previous\nversions of the Server app.\n\n707\n00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:55.630\nSo, 5.1 is out now.\n\n708\n00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:56.830\nI can't download 5.0.\n\n709\n00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:57.760\nI can't download 4.0.3.\n\n710\n00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:02.270\nSo I've made a habit of it that every time\nI do an update, I copy the Server app.\n\n711\n00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:03.720\nI have it on a little external hard drive.\n\n712\n00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.620\nI save old versions\nlike my sad collection.\n\n713\n00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.240\nAnd so, that's a good idea, though,\nif you think you might need those,\n\n714\n00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.560\ncuz Apple won't let you download\nthose old versions again.\n\n715\n00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:15.370\nAll right, so just be aware of that,\ndo testing, do a Time Machine Backup,\n\n716\n00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:16.680\nthat way you've got a nice, good cover.\n\n717\n00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.160\nYou can always jump back.\n\n718\n00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.720\n>> Thanks for that advice, Don, and\nthank you for joining us out here.\n\n719\n00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.680\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n720\n00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.190\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n721\n00:33:24.190 -->

Briant\n\n3\n00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.241\nand in today's episode we're gonna\nbe talking about the OS 10 server.\n\n4\n00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:24.450\nAnd joining us in the studios again to\nhelp us out in this endeavor is none other\n\n5\n00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.890\nthan Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.520\nDon welcome and how you doing sir?\n\n7\n00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.600\n>> I'm doing great Wes thanks for\n\n8\n00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.880\nhaving me back on the show and this is\ngonna be the first episode where we jump\n\n9\n00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.190\ninto actually configuring one of\nthe services inside of the server app.\n\n10\n00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.010\nSo if you watched\nthe first couple of shows,\n\n11\n00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.410\nwe saw how to get the server app\ninstalled and up and running,\n\n12\n00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.960\nbut it doesn't actually do much\nuntil we start some services.\n\n13\n00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.165\nSo I wanna kick things off with what I\nthink is the most important service, and\n\n14\n00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:47.769\nthat's DNS.\n\n15\n00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.494\nNow, different people have different\nopinions, we're gonna cover them all,\n\n16\n00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:52.720\nI just have to start somewhere so\nDNS is where we'll start.\n\n17\n00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.630\nNow, DNS is the Domain Name System and\nwhether you know it or not,\n\n18\n00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.310\nyou use it every single day.\n\n19\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.510\nWhen we browse to a web page or\naccess a network resource as human beings\n\n20\n00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.940\nwe don't think in terms of numbers,\nwe think in terms of names.\n\n21\n00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.620\nIf you wanna go to Apple's\nwebsite I go to www.apple.com.\n\n22\n00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.880\nIf I wanna access a file server\nhere in the building I might go to\n\n23\n00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.790\nFileServer 01 or\nsomething like that but they're names.\n\n24\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.380\nNames are easy to remember.\n\n25\n00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.310\nBut your computer doesn't think that way.\n\n26\n00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.530\nYour computer thinks in terms of numbers.\n\n27\n00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.360\nEvery computer, every server has a number\nan IP address that we wanna access and\n\n28\n00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.270\nwe need to translate from name to number.\n\n29\n00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.400\nDNS is what does that,\nDomain Naming System.\n\n30\n00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.550\nAnd it's happening all the time.\n\n31\n00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.950\nWhen you fire up that web browser and\n\n32\n00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.740\nyou go to Apple's website, in the\nbackground it's doing a look up, right?\n\n33\n00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.100\nLet me show you how that works\nbefore we dive into the server side.\n\n34\n00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.070\nSo, if I take this client and\nI'll just fire up Safari.\n\n35\n00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.944\nAnd in Safari I can go to www.apple.com,\nright?\n\n36\n00:01:48.944 --> 00:01:51.126\nSo I'm going to browse their website,\nthere it is.\n\n37\n00:01:51.126 --> 00:01:52.891\nAll I had to know was a name.\n\n38\n00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:56.465\nBut in the background it did\na name resolution look up, so\n\n39\n00:01:56.465 --> 00:01:59.666\nwe can see that if we fire\nup our network utility, so\n\n40\n00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:04.740\nI'm going to fire up the network utility,\nand I'm going to go to the Lookup tab.\n\n41\n00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.190\nAnd here I can type in www.apple.com and\nI can do a look up all right.\n\n42\n00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.469\nAnd when it looks up, here it is.\n\n43\n00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:16.964\nApple.com was actually mapped\nto 104.107.38.42, right?\n\n44\n00:02:16.964 --> 00:02:19.750\nThat's what the computer saw,\nthat's what the computer wanted.\n\n45\n00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.410\nIt didn't want a name.\n\n46\n00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.950\nBut I can't remember this.\n\n47\n00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.510\nI can't remember 104.107.38.42,\nI guess I could, over time.\n\n48\n00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.890\nBut I couldn't remember a bunch\nof addresses like this.\n\n49\n00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.190\nBut I can remember a bunch of names.\n\n50\n00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.970\nI can remember CNN.com or\nITPro.tv, Amazon.com, Apple.com.\n\n51\n00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.800\nThose are easy to remember, all right?\n\n52\n00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.030\nSo the naming system is designed\nto make life easy for us.\n\n53\n00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.830\nAnd that's true on the internet and\nit's true on your own private network.\n\n54\n00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.590\nSo if you're going to be setting up\na server, you probably want it to have\n\n55\n00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.400\na name and you probably want people\nto be able to resolve that name.\n\n56\n00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.130\nThe problem is on your own network\nyour probably using private IP's.\n\n57\n00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.750\nRight?\nNot public IP's like out on the internet.\n\n58\n00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.580\nSo we can't rely on the internet\nDNS servers to do our lookups.\n\n59\n00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.150\nSo we need to set up our own name\nserver to ba able to power this.\n\n60\n00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.820\nAll right.\n\n61\n00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.640\nSetting up your own\nnameserver is not hard.\n\n62\n00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.360\nIt's built right here into the server app,\nand\n\n63\n00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.030\nif you're gonna be doing Open Directory,\n\n64\n00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.370\nyou'll very likely want\nto set this up anyway.\n\n65\n00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.140\nA lot of services will use Bonjour,\nand Bonjour's great.\n\n66\n00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.630\nYou can find other machines\non your network, but\n\n67\n00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.950\nsome services don't use Bonjour.\n\n68\n00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.300\nAnd so for them, you need DNS.\n\n69\n00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.890\nThe other thing is,\nBonjour is not routable.\n\n70\n00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.800\nBonjour will find other clients right\nthere on the same network as you.\n\n71\n00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.820\nBut what if you have more\nthan one network, right?\n\n72\n00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.810\nMaybe you work for a school board, and\nyou've got a central data center at your\n\n73\n00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.190\ncounty office, and\nthen you've got 100 schools out there.\n\n74\n00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.050\nThat's 100 different networks.\n\n75\n00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.740\nYou can't run Bonjour in one school,\nand find servers in another.\n\n76\n00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.090\nYou can't detect machines\non a different network.\n\n77\n00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.090\nWith DNS we can, with DNS everybody\nregisters their name with DNS.\n\n78\n00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.740\nAnd once it's tied to DNS,\nnow when we do a lookup,\n\n79\n00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.170\nwe just look it up on the name server.\n\n80\n00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.160\nAnd then we can reach out and connect that\nperson, it makes life a lot easier and\n\n81\n00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.540\nmuch more scalable.\n\n82\n00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.410\n>> Now Don, if we have a service maybe, or\n\n83\n00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.120\nmaybe an application there that starts\nwith let's say an IP address, and\n\n84\n00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.705\nI don't have a name, is there a way that\nwe can connect if we have an IP address?\n\n85\n00:04:16.705 --> 00:04:18.465\nBut we don't have the name itself?\n\n86\n00:04:18.465 --> 00:04:22.545\n>> Sometimes, yeah, what I'm showing\nyou here is a forward lookup, right?\n\n87\n00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:24.455\nForward lookup is a name to an IP.\n\n88\n00:04:24.455 --> 00:04:26.995\nBut you also have what's\ncalled a reverse lookup.\n\n89\n00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:29.605\nAnd a reverse lookup is where\nyou go from an IP to a name.\n\n90\n00:04:29.605 --> 00:04:32.555\nNow when would we need that?\n\n91\n00:04:32.555 --> 00:04:34.225\nFor us, most of the time we don't need it.\n\n92\n00:04:34.225 --> 00:04:36.350\nIt is not something that we\nreally need to mess with.\n\n93\n00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.050\nBut if you're ever trying to troubleshoot\nyour network, troubleshoot a problem and\n\n94\n00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.050\nfind your way back, whatever.\n\n95\n00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.480\nThat reverse lookup is kind of handy, kind\nof useful to see what you're connected.\n\n96\n00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.390\nLet's see if I can give you\na quick example on the spot.\n\n97\n00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.399\nWhen I fire this up and\nI went to apple.com, right?\n\n98\n00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:56.500\nI went to that website,\nI know it's called apple.com.\n\n99\n00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.220\nAnd I did a four look up to find that IP.\n\n100\n00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.780\nWell if I took that IP.\n\n101\n00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.460\nAnd I plugged it in here and did a lookup,\nit's gonna do a reverse lookup.\n\n102\n00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.195\nAnd look at the reverse\nlookup that I got on that,\n\n103\n00:05:08.195 --> 00:05:12.560\ndeploy.static.akamaitechnologies.com.\n\n104\n00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.420\nThat's not Apple, right?\n\n105\n00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.980\nWell, Akamai is a CDN,\na content distribution network.\n\n106\n00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.150\nThey have servers all over the world.\n\n107\n00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.860\nIf you want to have a website with\nmillions of visitors that are all over\n\n108\n00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.870\nthe planet you can contract it through\nAkamai and you can use their network and\n\n109\n00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.520\nthat's exactly what Apple's doing.\n\n110\n00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.580\nSo I was able to use that\nreverse lookup to figure out\n\n111\n00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.690\nhow Apple's hosting their server.\n\n112\n00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.950\nNot the most useful information in the\nworld, but that's kind of one use for it.\n\n113\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.550\nMore importantly, though, there's some\nutilities like If I go into terminal and\n\n114\n00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.750\nI do a netstat -an, let's see,\nwas that the one I wanted?\n\n115\n00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.970\nWhat a mess.\n\n116\n00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.085\nLet's just do a straight up netstat.\n\n117\n00:05:51.085 --> 00:05:53.820\n[LAUGH] There we go.\n\n118\n00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.120\nIf I do a netstat, it shows all the\ndifferent network connections that I've\n\n119\n00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.320\ngot open, and when you look at those\nnetwork connections Somewhere in here,\n\n120\n00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.050\nI probably should have filled\nthrough this, here we go.\n\n121\n00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.210\nWhen you look at all your network\nconnections, some of them, it shows an IP.\n\n122\n00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.190\nWhen you see an IP, I know that I've got\nan open connection to this IP address.\n\n123\n00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.500\nWho is it?\n\n124\n00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.910\nI don't know,\nit didn't figure it out right.\n\n125\n00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:22.090\nBut other ones, you'll see where it\nactually has some kind of a name\n\n126\n00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.710\nIt was able to do a reversed lookup to\nfigure out who that was for me, and\n\n127\n00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.950\nunfortunately its truncating some of\nthese where I can't truly see, but\n\n128\n00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.210\nlike here I've got appleglobal or\nwherever.\n\n129\n00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.920\nSo the reversal lookups\ncan help me to figure\n\n130\n00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.050\nout who it is I have a connection open to.\n\n131\n00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.910\nThis is a virtual machine and\n\n132\n00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.480\nthe only thing I've done is\nfired up Apple's website.\n\n133\n00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.090\nBut look at all these connections.\n\n134\n00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.800\nAll of that from Apple's website.\n\n135\n00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.630\nWho are all these servers?\n\n136\n00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.930\nCan I trust them?\n\n137\n00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.530\nMaybe, maybe not, right?\n\n138\n00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.210\nSome of them are content discretion\nnetworks like the cdn right here, right?\n\n139\n00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.090\nOthers, I don't know who they are,\nand so I might need to go in and\n\n140\n00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.870\ndo over just like trying to\nfigure out who that is and.\n\n141\n00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.700\nA lot of people don't register\ntheir reverse lookups.\n\n142\n00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.220\nSo it might be that you can't\ndo a reverse lookup on one.\n\n143\n00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.060\nLike if I take this guy and\n\n144\n00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.700\nI run a lookup on it,\noperation could not be completed, right.\n\n145\n00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.180\nSo reverse lookups are useful but\ndon't rely on them,\n\n146\n00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.600\ndon't count on them being there\nbecause they aren't always there.\n\n147\n00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.360\nAll right so let's say that I want\nto set myself up as a DNS server\n\n148\n00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.190\nWell the process isn't that hard.\n\n149\n00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.920\nFirst off, the thing we need to recognize,\n\n150\n00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.430\nis that DNS names are made\nup of more than one part.\n\n151\n00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.520\nWhen you look at a name like this,\nthe first part here https,\n\n152\n00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.330\nthat's the protocol I'm going to use.\n\n153\n00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.470\nThe hyper text transfer\nprotocol with ssl or secure.\n\n154\n00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:44.020\nRight?\nSo, this is a secure version of http.\n\n155\n00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:44.930\nThat's just a protocol.\n\n156\n00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.300\nAnd I don't care,\nDNS doesn't care about protocols.\n\n157\n00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.210\nBut then I got this name,\nwww.apple.com, all right?\n\n158\n00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.772\nEvery DNS name is made up of three parts.\n\n159\n00:07:55.772 --> 00:07:58.405\nWith the parts basically, I shouldn't say\nevery, I say it could be two parts really.\n\n160\n00:07:58.405 --> 00:08:00.494\nBut typically you have three parts.\n\n161\n00:08:00.494 --> 00:08:04.187\nThere is the Top Level Domain or the TLD.\n\n162\n00:08:04.187 --> 00:08:07.790\nThere is the Domain, and\nthen there's the Host Name.\n\n163\n00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.680\nAnd there could be a few\nother pieces kinda\n\n164\n00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.340\nthrown in there just depending\non what it is that we're doing.\n\n165\n00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:22.200\nSo, let me get into text edit for\nexample and I will show you what I mean.\n\n166\n00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.075\nWhen I look at something\nlike www.apple.com.\n\n167\n00:08:26.075 --> 00:08:30.210\nOkay, what this is actually gonna break\ndown to is just a few different pieces.\n\n168\n00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.780\nYou know, we're all gonna have seizures if\nI leave that page open in the background.\n\n169\n00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.280\nLet me get rid of that.\n\n170\n00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.540\nSo what this is really made up\nof is really three parts, right?\n\n171\n00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.290\nwww that's the host.\n\n172\n00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:40.830\nOkay.\n\n173\n00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.920\nSo there's a server somewhere\nin Apple's network or\n\n174\n00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.370\n[INAUDIBLE] network, that's called www.\n\n175\n00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.860\nWell, the name doesn't actually\nhave to match the server.\n\n176\n00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.360\nThe server can be called\nany number of things.\n\n177\n00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.780\nBut www is like a nickname\nthat has been given.\n\n178\n00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.600\nAll right.\n\n179\n00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.280\nThen you've got Apple, that's the domain.\n\n180\n00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:02.420\nso apple went and registered Apple.com\nwith one of the registrars that are out\n\n181\n00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.070\nthere many many years ago and\nApple is their domain.\n\n182\n00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:09.470\nAnd then in com,\nthat is the top level domain, okay?\n\n183\n00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.970\nor the TLD.\n\n184\n00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.950\nNow the host and the domain,\nyou get to pick those.\n\n185\n00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.490\nYou can use whatever you want as long as\nsomebody else doesn't already have it.\n\n186\n00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.840\nBut the top level domain,\nyou don't get to pick, right?\n\n187\n00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.860\nThose are determined by\nthe internet registrars.\n\n188\n00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.450\nThey make those.\n\n189\n00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.300\nThe ARIN, INA, those guys.\n\n190\n00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.270\nInterNick is a big part of that, and\n\n191\n00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.950\nthey determine what top level\ndomains are going to be available.\n\n192\n00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:38.380\nSo you usually see .com, .net, .edu, .org.\n\n193\n00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.460\nThere's country codes.\n\n194\n00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.334\nAlmost every country has them,\n\n195\n00:09:42.334 --> 00:09:47.260\n.uk, .us, what is Germany, .de, so\nthose country codes are out there.\n\n196\n00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.740\nAnd there's new ones like .info or\n.museum.\n\n197\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.600\nThere's a bunch of different\nones that have come out lately.\n\n198\n00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.600\nSo you may see those too.\n\n199\n00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.200\nThat top level domain though, that's\nwhere you basically have to register and\n\n200\n00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.625\nyou have to pick one domain and so\n\n201\n00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:07.590\nApple.com is their fully qualified\ndomain name, their FQDN so Apple.com.\n\n202\n00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.350\nWhen you create a DNS server you have to\npick what domains you're gonna host and\n\n203\n00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.090\nthose are called zones.\n\n204\n00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.490\nAnd zones, can be forward look\nup zones where it's name IP, or\n\n205\n00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.060\nit can be reverse look up\nzones where it's IP to name.\n\n206\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.970\nSo a zone corresponds to a domain.\n\n207\n00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.410\nSo Apple.com that may ne one zone,\n\n208\n00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.451\nand then I might have\nGoogle.com that's a zone.\n\n209\n00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:30.320\nAmazon.co that's a zone and\n\n210\n00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.160\nif I'm doing name IP they will\nbe forward look up zones.\n\n211\n00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.920\nInside the zone well host,\nthat's what this www is.\n\n212\n00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.940\nA host is a particular system and\nthe ip address is associated with it.\n\n213\n00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.780\nSo there will be an ip type www.\n\n214\n00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.530\nNow it might be a real host or\nmight be an alias.\n\n215\n00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.100\nYou gonna have alias to\npoint somewhere else.\n\n216\n00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.710\nSo there is different forms of\nhost records we can have, but\n\n217\n00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.379\nthat's kind of the basic\ncomponents inside of it.\n\n218\n00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.400\nYou can have sub domains though.\n\n219\n00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.890\nThat does happen.\n\n220\n00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:03.500\nSo you'll see, what's a good example,\nlike store.apple.com.\n\n221\n00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:08.210\nAnd they might have us.store or\neu.store or whatever.\n\n222\n00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.310\nSo what you have here is\nmore than one domain.\n\n223\n00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:15.880\nYou have the primary domain and\nthen you have sub-domains underneath it.\n\n224\n00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.940\nAnd so you may have one or\nmore sub domains.\n\n225\n00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.650\nSub domains are a lot less common.\n\n226\n00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:20.850\nBut plenty of people use them.\n\n227\n00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.450\nWe have some here at IT Pro TV.\n\n228\n00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:26.990\nSo, we have itpro.tv is our main\ndomain that we use for our website.\n\n229\n00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.070\nBut we have lab.itpro.tv and\n\n230\n00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.410\nthat's a subdomain that we\nuse on the show sometimes.\n\n231\n00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:37.180\nAnd so you'll see me bring\nup server1.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n232\n00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.110\nServer o one, that's my host.\n\n233\n00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:43.180\nLab that's the sub domain,\nIT PRO that's the domain, and\n\n234\n00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.630\nTV that's the top level domain, right?\n\n235\n00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.700\nAnd TV is only two letters so\nit's a country code.\n\n236\n00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.550\nIt's actually the country code for\nI think it's Tuvalu, is the country.\n\n237\n00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:55.030\nCountry nobody's ever heard of, well,\nexcept for the people who live there.\n\n238\n00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.780\nBut it's TV, like television.\n\n239\n00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.510\nAnd so that country was very smart.\n\n240\n00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.050\nAnd they said hey let's start selling\nthis out to the rest of the world who\n\n241\n00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:01.930\nare making a lot of money on it.\n\n242\n00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.550\nAnd they did so\nit was a good revenue generator for them.\n\n243\n00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:07.530\nSo those are kind of what's going to\ngo on inside of our domain names.\n\n244\n00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:11.210\nWhen you set up a DNS server You\nneed to pick a domain name, and\n\n245\n00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.850\nkind of throw it in there and\nget that set up.\n\n246\n00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:13.830\nSo that's what I'm gonna do,\n\n247\n00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:18.746\nis I'm gonna jump into my server app,\nwhich is around here somewhere.\n\n248\n00:12:18.746 --> 00:12:19.550\n[INAUDIBLE] client.\n\n249\n00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.440\nLet me get over on my server,\nthat'll make a little more sense.\n\n250\n00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:27.340\nAnd on my server,\nright under the services, there's no DNS.\n\n251\n00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.820\nWell, it's just one of the hidden ones.\n\n252\n00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:33.140\nSo down here under advance I can hit show,\nand you'll find DNS right there, and\n\n253\n00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.370\nhere's where I can set up my DNS server.\n\n254\n00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.700\nIt's off by default and\nwe can go in and configure it.\n\n255\n00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.240\nThe first configuration option,\nwhat network should be allowed to use it?\n\n256\n00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.090\nDo I wanna be a DNS server for\nthe whole world, or just for\n\n257\n00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.100\nmy own network, normally you just\nwant it for your own network, but\n\n258\n00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.170\nthe default is all networks the idea being\nyou probably have a firewall controlling\n\n259\n00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:53.870\nwhether you have global access or not.\n\n260\n00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.810\n>> Now Don, if you're running something\nlike an Open Directory database,\n\n261\n00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:00.970\nI know there's things like attributes,\npermission, just all this\n\n262\n00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:03.970\ndifferent type of information that's\ngonna be stored in that database.\n\n263\n00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:07.770\nNow I can only assume that DNS\nhere's gonna have a database, and\n\n264\n00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.270\nif so, what's stored in it?\n\n265\n00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:10.360\nSo it does.\n\n266\n00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.570\nIt's got a database.\n\n267\n00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:14.440\nAnd it's not a true database in\nthe sense like, I don't have My SQL or\n\n268\n00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.200\nsomething powering it.\n\n269\n00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.220\nIt's really a series of text files.\n\n270\n00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.960\nAnd each text file represents a zone.\n\n271\n00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.370\nAnd inside of it it's just a list of\nall the hosts that are inside it.\n\n272\n00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:24.920\nAnd we're gonna see\na graphical version of it.\n\n273\n00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.290\nBut in the end, it's stored in\na text file on the hard drive.\n\n274\n00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.900\nAnything inside /library, /server, you can\nkinda browse in there and find them but\n\n275\n00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.150\nthat's what the data base will have.\n\n276\n00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.490\nBasically there's a list of these names\nto their numbers or vice versa for\n\n277\n00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.850\na reverse [INAUDIBLE].\n\n278\n00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.090\nAlright, the next option that I\nhave here is a forwarding service.\n\n279\n00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:43.450\nWhat's a forwarding server?\n\n280\n00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.230\nWell, your data server has\na name just like Wes mentioned.\n\n281\n00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.970\nIt has names, IPs.\n\n282\n00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.640\nBut what if it doesn't have the answer?\n\n283\n00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.050\nWhat if I don't have the answer for\nsomething you're looking up.\n\n284\n00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:54.590\nWe can specify a forwarding server.\n\n285\n00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:55.320\nA backup.\n\n286\n00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.400\nHey, if I don't know the answer,\ngo to this guy.\n\n287\n00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.570\nAnd this is normally going to be\nyour internet service provider.\n\n288\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:01.100\nRight.\n\n289\n00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.080\nWhoever it is that you're using as\nan ISP they have DNS servers that you'll\n\n290\n00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.440\npiggyback off of them.\n\n291\n00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.000\nIn my case though, I'll just use Google.\n\n292\n00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.270\nIt's got one in here because I was\nconfigured for DHCP at one point, so\n\n293\n00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:12.580\nit's using that value.\n\n294\n00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.540\nBut I'm just going to\nadd in some of Google's.\n\n295\n00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:18.980\nSo if I don't know the answer, hopefully\nGoogle does and I'll pass off to them.\n\n296\n00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.700\nAnd you can put more than one,\n\n297\n00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.460\nit'll never use the second one\nunless the first one fails.\n\n298\n00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.970\nSo if the first server goes offline,\nthe second server will be used but\n\n299\n00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.890\notherwise it will only\nuse the first server.\n\n300\n00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.060\nSo those are now my forwarding servers.\n\n301\n00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.440\nIf a DNS request comes to this server, and\n\n302\n00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:38.140\nit doesn't know the answer It will reach\nout to Google and try and get the answer.\n\n303\n00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.160\nYou can specify whoever it is\nthat your forwarding servers are.\n\n304\n00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.800\nI normally use whoever my ISP is.\n\n305\n00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.750\nThen, how do I wanna perform lookups?\n\n306\n00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:50.810\nDo I want to perform lookups for\neverybody or just certain people?\n\n307\n00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:54.780\nAnd so\nright now it's set to only some clients.\n\n308\n00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.000\nI don't wanna answer everybody's DNS\nrequests I'm just gonna specify certain\n\n309\n00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.150\npeople, and you can go to edit the clients\nand you can specify just for myself,\n\n310\n00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:09.150\nclients on the same network as me, or\nclients on the following networks right.\n\n311\n00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:13.690\nNow if I only have one network,\none sub net then I'm covered right here by\n\n312\n00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:17.910\nthis default option I'm gonna answer DNS\nlookups for people on the network as me.\n\n313\n00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.300\nBut I have more than one network,\nI may need to come in and add that.\n\n314\n00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.960\nSo maybe I've got the 192.168.0.0 network,\nand so we can add that one.\n\n315\n00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.030\nAnd then maybe I've also got 192.168.1.0,\nand so I can add that one too, right?\n\n316\n00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.020\nAnd we just keep going down the list\n\n317\n00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:37.270\nadding all the different networks that\nyou've got inside of your company,\n\n318\n00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.780\nuntil you've got all\nthe different networks covered.\n\n319\n00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.510\nSo that your server will\nallow them to do the lookups.\n\n320\n00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.390\nIt's a great way to restrict access\nto the server just to control\n\n321\n00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.440\nwho's allowed to do lookups, all right.\n\n322\n00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.370\nYou may not need that at all if\nyou've only got one network,\n\n323\n00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.670\nthe default options\nare usually pretty good.\n\n324\n00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.893\nOr you can say, you know what,\nwe'll just allow everybody.\n\n325\n00:15:53.893 --> 00:15:57.368\nI'll everybody to do lookups on this\nsystem I don't want to limit it.\n\n326\n00:15:57.368 --> 00:16:00.132\nThe key thing is that you\nneed to have this turned on.\n\n327\n00:16:00.132 --> 00:16:03.541\nIf you have perform lookup for turned off\nAnd you don't perform lookups for anybody,\n\n328\n00:16:03.541 --> 00:16:05.729\nyour service might as well\nbe turned off at that point.\n\n329\n00:16:05.729 --> 00:16:08.116\n>> If you are gonna use other networks,\nDon,\n\n330\n00:16:08.116 --> 00:16:10.965\ndoes that have to be\nrestricted to the same subnet,\n\n331\n00:16:10.965 --> 00:16:15.050\nor the same IP range, or can that be\nacross different networks as well?\n\n332\n00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:16.410\n>> Yeah it can be across.\n\n333\n00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.730\n>> Yeah?\n>> It could even be public ranges,\n\n334\n00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:22.770\nI'm doing private ones here, but\nif I go back to only some clients and\n\n335\n00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:26.370\nwe go to set this up, cuz I turned off,it\nerased everything which is convenient, but\n\n336\n00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:30.680\nI can come back in here and\nstart to specify this, and so\n\n337\n00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.210\nI can say 192.168.0.0/24,\nand, whoops [LAUGH].\n\n338\n00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.690\nAnd I can hit enter.\n\n339\n00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:40.300\nAnd then I can add in another one, and\n\n340\n00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:46.689\nmaybe I'll do 172.16.0.0/16 or\nI might do 10.0.0.0/8, right?\n\n341\n00:16:46.689 --> 00:16:51.770\nYou just put in whatever networks\nit is that you want to authorize.\n\n342\n00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:52.890\nYou can be all over the place,\n\n343\n00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:56.350\nthey dont have to be all the same network\n>> So as long as you got your network in\n\n344\n00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:01.619\nthe background set up for routing I\nmean to the server It's not gonna use\n\n345\n00:17:01.619 --> 00:17:03.490\n>> this is not routing And\n\n346\n00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.520\nthis is not gonna allow the two\nnetworks to see each other,\n\n347\n00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.000\nwe have to set that up separately right.\n\n348\n00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.480\nBut assuming the networks\ncan already see each other,\n\n349\n00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.180\nnow people can use me as the DNS server.\n\n350\n00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:16.670\nAll right, let's see,\nthe other options are host names right.\n\n351\n00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.365\nHere's where we can actually start to\ndefine the host names that we're gonna do\n\n352\n00:17:19.365 --> 00:17:20.270\nlook-ups for.\n\n353\n00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.620\nNow, my server is brand new so\nit doesn't have any hostnames,\n\n354\n00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:24.290\nit doesn't have any zones or\nanything like that.\n\n355\n00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:25.940\nIt's basically empty.\n\n356\n00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.780\nI need to create those, okay?\n\n357\n00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:28.930\nNow down here at the bottom.\n\n358\n00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:30.370\nYou got the plus sign to add a host.\n\n359\n00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:31.840\nYou also got the gear and\n\n360\n00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.380\nif you hit the gear,\nthe only other option is Show All Records.\n\n361\n00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.560\nWell, isn't it showing all\nthe records by default?\n\n362\n00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.500\nIt's actually not.\n\n363\n00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.510\nThere's a lot of hidden records\nthat don't show up by default.\n\n364\n00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:44.130\nThings like SOA records.\n\n365\n00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:45.390\nSOAs are Start of Authority.\n\n366\n00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.720\nThat's who's in control of that DNS zone.\n\n367\n00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.000\nThose don't show up by default.\n\n368\n00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.310\nSo we can turn that on\nto see a little more.\n\n369\n00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:54.330\nI'm gonna wait on that, though cuz\nwe need to at least get something.\n\n370\n00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.360\nSo I'm gonna hit Add, and\nwe're gonna add a new host.\n\n371\n00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.752\nNow when you add a host that asks for\nthe host name, and so I'm gonna create\n\n372\n00:18:00.752 --> 00:18:06.036\nOSX-SERVER01.lab.itpro.tv, okay?\n\n373\n00:18:06.036 --> 00:18:08.000\nDNS names are not case sensitive.\n\n374\n00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.290\nI've just gotten in the habit of\nmaking the host name capital and\n\n375\n00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.150\neverything else lower case.\n\n376\n00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.030\nBut they're not case sensitive,\nyou can type it however you want.\n\n377\n00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.090\nIn fact, let me, I'm just not gonna\nspazz out on this one at all.\n\n378\n00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:19.210\nI get a little anal retentive sometimes\nabout how I want my names to be.\n\n379\n00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:21.970\nBut, we'll put it this way.\n\n380\n00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.850\nSo, osx-server01.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n381\n00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.690\nOkay now what am I doing here?\n\n382\n00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.530\nWell, I'm defining a host name.\n\n383\n00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.920\nThat's the host name.\n\n384\n00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.530\nAnd I'm defining a domain name.\n\n385\n00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.900\nA sub-domain, a parent domain,\nand a top-level domain,\n\n386\n00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.180\ndefining each one right there in the list.\n\n387\n00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.620\nNow it's gonna figure all that out for me.\n\n388\n00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.740\nI don't have to tell it, it knows that.\n\n389\n00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.540\nAnd now I need to tell it\nthe IP address of that system.\n\n390\n00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.950\nWell, if I go into my System Preferences,\nyou could see it through the Server App,\n\n391\n00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:50.330\nbut I'd have to close this window.\n\n392\n00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:51.639\nSo, I'm gonna go back here to my network.\n\n393\n00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.860\nAnd I am 192.168.0.151.\n\n394\n00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:58.550\nI do have a little problem,\nin that I'm using DHCP.\n\n395\n00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:01.150\nSo my address could change over time.\n\n396\n00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.700\nThere's ways that we can\nget that to update, but\n\n397\n00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.520\non a server I don't want that\nto change anyway cuz I'm gonna\n\n398\n00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.870\nconfigure people to use me for DNS.\n\n399\n00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.440\nAnd if my IP address changes\nnow they can't find me.\n\n400\n00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.720\nSo I need a static IP anyway so I'm just\ngoing to hardset that IP All stay dot 151.\n\n401\n00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.286\nAnd I'll set it.\n\n402\n00:19:16.286 --> 00:19:21.820\nNow I'm going to hit Apply on that and\n\n403\n00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:25.890\nbefore I move on let me go and\nupdate my DNS because it wiped those out.\n\n404\n00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.980\nAnd for my DNS what am I going to do here.\n\n405\n00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:34.090\nWell normally I put my Google servers,\nbut I'm about to become a DNS server.\n\n406\n00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.000\nSo I can use myself for DNS.\n\n407\n00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.780\nAnd this is what you\nnormally do on a DNS server.\n\n408\n00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.440\nYou can put 127.0.0.1 okay.\n\n409\n00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.660\nWhere did I get that IP address from?\n\n410\n00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:48.214\nCuz that's nothing like 192.168.0.151\nthat I just gave myself, alright?\n\n411\n00:19:48.214 --> 00:19:53.690\n127.0.0.1 is an IP address shortcut.\n\n412\n00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.190\nIt's a shortcut that means yourself.\n\n413\n00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:57.850\nIt's called a loop back address.\n\n414\n00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:59.940\nAnd so it's saying I wanna use myself.\n\n415\n00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.260\nThis is a nice shortcut to use because\nif I change my IP in the future\n\n416\n00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.320\nI'll still use myself for\nDNS even without updating this.\n\n417\n00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.340\nSo I'm saying use myself for DNS.\n\n418\n00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:16.040\nSo now whenever I do a DNS lookup\nI'm gonna ask myself for the answer.\n\n419\n00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.940\nOn my other clients, like if I wanted\nWes' laptop to do a lookup here,\n\n420\n00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.680\nI'd go to Wes', I'd go into the network\nsettings, I'd go right here and\n\n421\n00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.330\nI would set it to 192.168.0.151.\n\n422\n00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:23.820\nI would point him to that IP address.\n\n423\n00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:27.040\nAnd that's why I wanted it to\nbe static in case it changes.\n\n424\n00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:33.560\nWell to prevent it from changing I\nguess is what I'm really trying to say.\n\n425\n00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:39.040\nAll right, so now I've got that set and\nI'm going to apply that and\n\n426\n00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.345\nnow back here I'm gonna say that my server\n\n427\n00:20:42.345 --> 00:20:48.420\nosx.server01.lab.itpro.tv is\ngoing to be 192.168.0.151.\n\n428\n00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:54.360\nSo if anybody ever tries to find me,\nthey'll get my address right there.\n\n429\n00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.430\nYou can get at more than one address.\n\n430\n00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.740\nBut if you do,\nsomething interesting happens.\n\n431\n00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.070\nIt's called DNS Round Robining.\n\n432\n00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.120\nOne person will get the first address, the\nnext person will get the second address,\n\n433\n00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.260\nand then back and\nforth between the two IP addresses.\n\n434\n00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:09.580\nIt's a cheap way to do load\nbalancing across multiple servers.\n\n435\n00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:13.740\nBut if one server goes down, half the\npeople are getting a bad address, right?\n\n436\n00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.760\nSo, it's not the greatest\nsolution in the world.\n\n437\n00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.460\nBut that's why you can add\nmore than one address.\n\n438\n00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.520\nI only have one IP so\nI'm gonna stick with that.\n\n439\n00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:26.750\nAnd then if I want aliases,\nwhat kind of aliases would I want?\n\n440\n00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.840\nWell, maybe I want this one\nto be www.lab.it.pro.tv.\n\n441\n00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.960\nSo I can just punch it www.\n\n442\n00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.070\nThe server is not called www.\n\n443\n00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:36.950\nThe server is called osx-server1 but\n\n444\n00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:41.710\nI want an alias of www so that people\ncan type that in and browse to it.\n\n445\n00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.240\nYou might have any number of aliases.\n\n446\n00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.530\nYou can have more than one.\n\n447\n00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:48.310\n>> So typing in an alias Don, let's say\nfor instance, this was a web server,\n\n448\n00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:53.090\nI wouldn't have to remember\nosx-server01.lab.itpro.tv,\n\n449\n00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:58.960\nI could just type in www,\nsay, maybe lab.itprotv.\n\n450\n00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.760\nThat's exactly right, yeah.\n\n451\n00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.950\n>> And that's useful because you\nmight have one alias that covers\n\n452\n00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:04.150\nmore than one server.\n\n453\n00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.220\nSo I might have server 01,\nserver 02, and server 03.\n\n454\n00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.220\nAnd WWW is an alias that points\nto all three of them, right?\n\n455\n00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.440\nSo now, people just go to WWW and\n\n456\n00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.850\nthey don't realize there's\nthree servers behind the scene.\n\n457\n00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:14.890\nOr 30 or 100 servers.\n\n458\n00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.720\nWhen I did that lookup for\nApple earlier, how many IPs did I get?\n\n459\n00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.720\nI got one.\n\n460\n00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.560\nDo they just have one server?\n\n461\n00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.300\nAbsolutely not.\n\n462\n00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.870\nOtherwise every Apple event that\nhappen their website would go down.\n\n463\n00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.330\nThey have hundreds,\nprobably thousands of servers.\n\n464\n00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.710\nBut it's all masked by\nthat one IP address.\n\n465\n00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:30.730\nSo you see that pretty commonly.\n\n466\n00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:35.260\nAll right, after that the only option\nI've got is to create an MX record.\n\n467\n00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:36.570\nThat's a mail exchange record.\n\n468\n00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:40.830\nIf this is an Email server, the way\npeople find this is with an MX record.\n\n469\n00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.030\nAnd so I need to check that off So\n\n470\n00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:45.920\nthat people will be able to\nfind me as a mail server.\n\n471\n00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.020\nIf I'm not going to be a mail server,\ndon't check that, right?\n\n472\n00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.710\nI'm not a mail server, I don't need it,\nI don't want that and you leave it off.\n\n473\n00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:53.460\nAll right, but I'll go ahead and\ncheck it on mine so you can see it.\n\n474\n00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.460\nAll right, I'm going to go ahead and\nhit create.\n\n475\n00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.068\nAnd now I've got an entry right there.\n\n476\n00:22:57.068 --> 00:23:01.829\nI've got osx-server01.lab.itpro.tv\nresolving to that address.\n\n477\n00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:07.990\nNow I created an alias of www,\nwhere is it?\n\n478\n00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.910\nI don't see it.\n\n479\n00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:11.700\nI created an MX Record,\na mail exchange,r where's that?\n\n480\n00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:12.760\nI don't see it.\n\n481\n00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.800\nAnd technically I created a forward\nlookup zone for lab.itpro.tv.\n\n482\n00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.810\nWhere's that?\n\n483\n00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:19.260\nI don't see that either.\n\n484\n00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.140\nThey try and keep it really simple.\n\n485\n00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.280\nBut this is where the show all\nrecords link comes in really handy.\n\n486\n00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:29.310\nso, if I hit that gear and\nI go to Show All Records, now\n\n487\n00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:34.460\nI see the forward lookup zone and the\nreverse lookup zone it made, it made both.\n\n488\n00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.770\nAnd in the forward lookup zone,\nit's lab.itpro.tv.\n\n489\n00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:43.830\nAnd if I expand that out, there's\nthe a record which is the host record for\n\n490\n00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.600\nosx and server1,\nthat's the main one that I made.\n\n491\n00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.790\nThere's the mail exchange record.\n\n492\n00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:52.580\nThere's the NS or Name Server\nrecord because I'm a DNS server.\n\n493\n00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.180\nThere's a CNAME.\n\n494\n00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.860\nA CNAME is a canonical name.\n\n495\n00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.661\nIt's an alias.\nI know we think A is alias but it isn't.\n\n496\n00:23:58.661 --> 00:24:00.310\nWell, sort of.\n\n497\n00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:01.727\nIt is an alias.\nA name alias for an IP But\n\n498\n00:24:01.727 --> 00:24:04.028\na canonical name is what we\nnormally think of as an alias.\n\n499\n00:24:04.028 --> 00:24:09.308\nwww.lab.itpro.tv is pointed\nat os10server01.itpro.tv so\n\n500\n00:24:09.308 --> 00:24:12.980\nhere's all those records\nthat I couldn't see.\n\n501\n00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:17.580\nAnd as I start adding more and\nmore names to this list,\n\n502\n00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.650\nthey'll just build out from here,\nI can see all those records.\n\n503\n00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:22.670\n>> Okay, now I got a question\nwith that record right there.\n\n504\n00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.020\nDid the defence department\nget into your server there?\n\n505\n00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.940\nCuz I see an ARP advance\nresearch project agency,\n\n506\n00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.320\ntell me the government is not sitting\nin your DNS server right now.\n\n507\n00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.037\n>> [LAUGH] Well,\n\n508\n00:24:32.037 --> 00:24:36.610\none thing you have to remember is that the\ninternet was developed by DARPA, right.\n\n509\n00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:39.380\nBy the,\nwhat's effectively the US military.\n\n510\n00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.890\nSo, it doesn't matter if you're in\nFrance or Australia or Russia or\n\n511\n00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:47.570\nwherever the infrastructure that you're\nusing was created by the US military.\n\n512\n00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:51.200\nNow, the US military doesn't control\nit anymore, so now it's open,\n\n513\n00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.930\nthe whole world has it, but\nsome of these names and\n\n514\n00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:57.880\nstuff harken back to the old days and\nnobody's bothered to change them.\n\n515\n00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:02.830\nthat's why we still see arpa right there,\nand you'll see in-addr,\n\n516\n00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:07.000\nthat's Internet address,\nas defined by arpa.\n\n517\n00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.920\nAnd so in a reverse look up,\nthat's what you see is the name.\n\n518\n00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.970\nThat's a standard name.\n\n519\n00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:13.190\nAnd they never bother to change\nit cuz nobody ever sees it and\n\n520\n00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.480\nnobody really cares, right.\n\n521\n00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.050\nArpa doesn't control it any more.\n\n522\n00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:20.840\nBut if I look in there I can find that\nname that's pointing to my server.\n\n523\n00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.120\nI mean the IP that's pointing\nto the name of my server.\n\n524\n00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.070\nSo there's that reverse look up.\n\n525\n00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.310\nAll right, so\nnow I'm effectively a DNS server.\n\n526\n00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:29.970\nHow do I know it's working?\n\n527\n00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:31.600\nWell, there's a few ways we can test it,\nright?\n\n528\n00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.210\nThe network utility,\nI think I already used that once.\n\n529\n00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:35.590\nSo I'm gonna fire up the network utility.\n\n530\n00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:40.018\nIf I go to the Lookup tab,\nI can do a lookup.\n\n531\n00:25:40.018 --> 00:25:43.200\nNow, it's gonna lookup against whatever\nserver it is that I've got specified on my\n\n532\n00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.770\nsystem and so I'm set to use myself.\n\n533\n00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:50.230\nSo if I look up osx-server01.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n534\n00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:55.620\nIt should do a lookup and\nI should get 192.168.0.151 right?\n\n535\n00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.275\nWell I don't.\n\n536\n00:25:58.275 --> 00:26:00.080\nWhy not?\n\n537\n00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.680\nI forgot the most important step,\n\n538\n00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.800\nI'm not gonna play it off as\nimportant I actually forgot.\n\n539\n00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.405\nSo I forgot the most important thing\nwhich is to turn the darn thing on.\n\n540\n00:26:06.405 --> 00:26:07.200\nRight?\n\n541\n00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.100\nSo I configured DNS back here, but\n\n542\n00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.560\nsee this giant switch right\nup here that says off?\n\n543\n00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.770\nYeah, I kinda forgot to flip that.\n\n544\n00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.510\nSo let's do that [LAUGH].\n\n545\n00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:19.090\n>> You gave yourself the own kill\nswitch engage there [LAUGH].\n\n546\n00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:19.630\n>> I know.\n\n547\n00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:21.700\nSo, it doesn't work so well when it's off.\n\n548\n00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.730\nSo now that I've turned it on,\nlet me jump back to my network utility and\n\n549\n00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.980\nsure enough, it was able to look it up and\nthere it is.\n\n550\n00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.290\nAnd let me test that alias that we did,\nright?\n\n551\n00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:34.018\nI did www.lab.itpro.tv and\nI'll look that up.\n\n552\n00:26:34.018 --> 00:26:35.074\nAnd it works.\n\n553\n00:26:35.074 --> 00:26:38.350\n.Now what if I do look up for Apple.com?\n\n554\n00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:42.740\nApple is not in my DNS zone and if you\nlook at here I don't have apple.com but\n\n555\n00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.890\nthat's okay because I\nput forwarding servers.\n\n556\n00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:52.920\nAnd so if I do look up for www.apple.com\nand look that up, it'll find it.\n\n557\n00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.050\nAnd it used the forwarding\nserver to do it.\n\n558\n00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:57.490\nAnd, actually got a little more\ninformation than last time.\n\n559\n00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:58.830\nLast time I only got an IPv4 address.\n\n560\n00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.215\nNow I'm getting IPv6 addresses also.\n\n561\n00:27:01.215 --> 00:27:02.810\nRight?\nBut it did the lookup,\n\n562\n00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.761\nit found the server, and there it is.\n\n563\n00:27:04.761 --> 00:27:06.859\nThe network utility is\na great way to do that.\n\n564\n00:27:06.859 --> 00:27:09.416\nThe only negative about\nthe network utility.\n\n565\n00:27:09.416 --> 00:27:14.490\nIs it only does lookups against the DNS\nserver that your system is actually using.\n\n566\n00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:16.230\nSo it can be difficult to test servers.\n\n567\n00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.910\nSo I find that I drop to\nthe command line more often.\n\n568\n00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:21.820\nThere's two different utilities in\nthe command line that are handy for this.\n\n569\n00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.540\nSo let me jump over to my terminal and\nI'll show you those.\n\n570\n00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.610\nThe one I normally use is nslookup.\n\n571\n00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:31.060\nNslookup is the modern utility for\ndoing named server lookups.\n\n572\n00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.250\nSo you can type nslookup.\n\n573\n00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.240\nAnd it'll drop you at\na special little prompt.\n\n574\n00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:40.670\nAnd from here you can say server, and\nspecify an IP address like 192.168.0.151.\n\n575\n00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:45.510\nAnd so\nnow I can do lookups against that server,\n\n576\n00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:48.360\nwithout actually having to set my\nmachine to use the server, right?\n\n577\n00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.880\nSo I can test against any\nserver that I want and so\n\n578\n00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:57.330\nI can type in osx- server01.lab.itpro.tv\nand I get to look up.\n\n579\n00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:01.790\nThat's important because if I\nuse server like google, right?\n\n580\n00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:08.030\nAnd I do that same look up so if I do\nlook up for osx-server01.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n581\n00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:14.460\nWhat was I get It gets\nthat it can't find it.\n\n582\n00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:18.090\nOn Google's DNS server\nlab.itpro.tv doesn't exist,\n\n583\n00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:21.270\nit's not on our public DNS servers, okay?\n\n584\n00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:24.450\nAnd that's important cuz you can\nactually cause some problems sometimes.\n\n585\n00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:30.990\nFor example, let's go back into my server,\nand I'm gonna add a new record.\n\n586\n00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:35.300\nI'm gonna add a machine record for\nwww, and\n\n587\n00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.960\nup here int he zone I'm gonna change that.\n\n588\n00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.420\nYou know what, shoot.\n\n589\n00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.600\nIt's gonna make me add the zone itself.\n\n590\n00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.190\nLet me cancel that.\n\n591\n00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:44.450\nSo I need to add a new zone, right?\n\n592\n00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:48.660\nSo when I go to add a new record\nI need to add the zone first so\n\n593\n00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.100\nI'm gonna add a primary zone.\n\n594\n00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.846\nAnd I'm gonna add a zone for apple.com.\n\n595\n00:28:52.846 --> 00:28:53.590\nRight?\n\n596\n00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.600\nI know I don't own it but\nI'm gonna do it anyway.\n\n597\n00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.965\nSo I'm gonna override their value.\n\n598\n00:28:56.965 --> 00:28:59.600\nOkay.\nSo I'm just gonna create a zone and\n\n599\n00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.390\nI'll create that.\n\n600\n00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:06.340\nAnd now when I go to add a new host,\nso I'm gonna add a machine record,\n\n601\n00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.880\nand I can pick from those two\ndifferent zones that I've got, right?\n\n602\n00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.520\nIt defaulted to one zone before\nbecause it was my first zone but\n\n603\n00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.270\nnow that I've got two I've got to pick.\n\n604\n00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:19.540\nAnd so I can create www.apple.com\nI'm gonna add a fake address.\n\n605\n00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.580\nWhoops.\nI'm gonna try and add a fake address.\n\n606\n00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.445\nThere we go, 1.1.1.1.\n\n607\n00:29:23.445 --> 00:29:25.550\nI say it's fake, but\nthat's a real address.\n\n608\n00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:26.370\nIt should be tied to somebody.\n\n609\n00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:27.830\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and create that.\n\n610\n00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:31.440\nSo now I've got this new entry in here for\nApple.com and\n\n611\n00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:35.540\nfrom the command prompt if I do a lookup.\n\n612\n00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.290\nLet me just kinda clear\nthis out a little bit.\n\n613\n00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:44.040\nIf I do a look up on this and\nI do it against my server, right?\n\n614\n00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.749\nSo if I run nslookup it's gonna\nconnect to me what I'm using.\n\n615\n00:29:47.749 --> 00:29:50.501\nAnd if I do a look up for www.apple.com.\n\n616\n00:29:50.501 --> 00:29:53.775\nI get 1.1.1.1, right?\n\n617\n00:29:53.775 --> 00:29:57.895\nBut now I can say okay what does\nthe rest of the world see, and\n\n618\n00:29:57.895 --> 00:30:02.290\nI can flip out to somebody\nelse's server My Googles.\n\n619\n00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:03.320\nAnd I can say, How about you?\n\n620\n00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.630\nWhat do you get when you\nlook up www.apple.com?\n\n621\n00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:08.320\nAnd I see something completely different.\n\n622\n00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:08.820\nRight?\nSo\n\n623\n00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.290\ngreat way to test against\nmultiple servers, nslookup.\n\n624\n00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:14.550\nThe network utility is really using this,\nit just doesn't give you all the options.\n\n625\n00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:16.700\n>> Now Don,\nyou opened up another care to worms.\n\n626\n00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:17.660\nI got a couple of questions.\n\n627\n00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:18.983\nBut now I got another one for you.\n\n628\n00:30:18.983 --> 00:30:21.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You mentioned the term primary zone.\n\n629\n00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:22.400\nWhat is that about?\n\n630\n00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.080\nWhat does that mean, primary zone?\n\n631\n00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.550\n>> All right, so\none problem that I'm gonna have here\n\n632\n00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:30.200\nis the zone I created as a primary zone\nit's existing right here on this server.\n\n633\n00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.000\nWhat if my server fails?\n\n634\n00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.520\nI need a backup somewhere.\n\n635\n00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.960\nAnd so whenever you create a primary zone,\n\n636\n00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.780\nyou can have other servers and\nthey're called secondary zones.\n\n637\n00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:38.340\nRight?\n\n638\n00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:42.170\nYour primary is the one that's active and\nrunning and you can add new records to it.\n\n639\n00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:43.820\nThe secondary zones\nare the ones we had to copy.\n\n640\n00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:48.800\nSo when I go back here into\nmy utility when I go to add\n\n641\n00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.450\nI can add a primary zone or a secondary.\n\n642\n00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:54.450\nAnd a secondary would be a copy\nof a zone stored somewhere else.\n\n643\n00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:56.860\nSo I'm not creating records here I'm\njust copying it from somewhere else.\n\n644\n00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:57.720\nMaking me a back up.\n\n645\n00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.810\nAnd that's how the DNS\ninfrastructure works.\n\n646\n00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:02.270\nPrimary means I'm the one who controls it.\n\n647\n00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:05.170\nI think I mention started\nauthority records earlier, SOAs.\n\n648\n00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.405\nIf you have a primary\nzone you are the SOA,\n\n649\n00:31:07.405 --> 00:31:09.860\nyou're the one who controls that zone,\nright?\n\n650\n00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.870\nYour secondaries are not SOAs.\n\n651\n00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:15.380\nThey don't have control over,\nthey just have a copy, right?\n\n652\n00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.169\nAnd you can create as many\nof those copies as you want.\n\n653\n00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:20.390\nAll right, some of the other things\nin here I think I talked about\n\n654\n00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:22.670\nMail Exchangers, Name Servers, Aliases.\n\n655\n00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.060\nService Records we don't see so\nmuch in the Apple world but\n\n656\n00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.190\nin the Microsoft world.\n\n657\n00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:29.050\nThey use Service Records to find\nthings like their Active Directory and\n\n658\n00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:29.800\nother resources.\n\n659\n00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.770\nSo those are some of the key records.\n\n660\n00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:34.930\nWhen we do lookups like here in nslookup.\n\n661\n00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:39.100\nIt's just doing lookups for machine\nrecords, right, for those A records.\n\n662\n00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.390\nBut you can say, set TYPE=All.\n\n663\n00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:45.470\nAnd it'll return all sorts of, oop.\n\n664\n00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:47.240\nAs any, it must be any TYPE.\n\n665\n00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.780\nSet TYPE=ANY, there we go.\n\n666\n00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:51.995\nAnd now you can do lookup for\nall sorts of crazy things.\n\n667\n00:31:51.995 --> 00:31:54.569\nAnd so I can say like apple.com, and\n\n668\n00:31:54.569 --> 00:31:58.233\nI'm gonna get a lot more\nthan just a single website.\n\n669\n00:31:58.233 --> 00:32:00.369\nI'm gonna see their\nmail exchanger records.\n\n670\n00:32:00.369 --> 00:32:04.340\nI see some service stuff,\nsome There's some nameservers.\n\n671\n00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:08.764\nI see their spam filter records and so on,\nand you see all sorts of things because\n\n672\n00:32:08.764 --> 00:32:14.130\nthey've done that configuration that\nI've changed to look up all the types.\n\n673\n00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:17.410\nNow nslookup is the new utility\nthat lets us to do this stuff.\n\n674\n00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:19.590\nThere is an older utility that's in place,\n\n675\n00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:23.620\nand I just wanna point out cuz it might be\non the exam, and that's the Dig utility.\n\n676\n00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:27.460\nDig works a lot like Nslookup but\nit shows more data by default.\n\n677\n00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:34.868\nFor example,\nlet me do nslookup www.apple.com.\n\n678\n00:32:34.868 --> 00:32:37.280\nThat's gonna return that address.\n\n679\n00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:43.070\nThat's it, it just gives that back to me,\nbut if I did dig www.apple.com.\n\n680\n00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:44.250\nWhat do I get?\n\n681\n00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:46.950\nWell I get the A record,\nI get the NS record.\n\n682\n00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:48.250\nI get a little more information.\n\n683\n00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.400\nThat's giving me more data, right?\n\n684\n00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.980\nThe dig utility is a little more hardcore.\n\n685\n00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:54.340\nI don't use it very often cuz\nit is the older utility and\n\n686\n00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.830\nI don't normally need the other data.\n\n687\n00:32:56.830 --> 00:33:01.350\nBut an example of what your seeing here\nis IN lets me know it's a forward lookup,\n\n688\n00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:02.690\na name to an IP.\n\n689\n00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:04.520\nA, it's an A record.\n\n690\n00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:08.288\nI can see the IP address here, that's\ngreat, and I can see the time to live.\n\n691\n00:33:08.288 --> 00:33:12.835\nIf I cache this entry on my DNS server,\nit can only stay there for\n\n692\n00:33:12.835 --> 00:33:16.800\n10,800 seconds, which I think is,\nis that 12 hours, what is that?\n\n693\n00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.260\nIt's something.\nIt's a good period of time, but after\n\n694\n00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.310\nthat period of time I've got to do the\nlook up again in case the IP changes so\n\n695\n00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:24.840\nthat's the limit of how\nlong I can cache that.\n\n696\n00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.360\nWe also see who's the authority,\nwho it is that controls it.\n\n697\n00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.930\nSo that's the kind of information you\nfind here, not terribly useful, but\n\n698\n00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:33.660\ndig and\nnslookup work great from the command line.\n\n699\n00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:37.060\nNetwork utility works great from the GUI\nit just does not give you many options,\n\n700\n00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.410\nbut after that you can get it set up.\n\n701\n00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:42.465\nSo between the server app itself for\nconfiguration and\n\n702\n00:33:42.465 --> 00:33:45.475\nthe command line utilities you can kind of\ntroubleshoot it, configure it, and see.\n\n703\n00:33:45.475 --> 00:33:48.955\n>> You know Don, something that's\nbeen burning through my mind.\n\n704\n00:33:48.955 --> 00:33:52.145\nYou've showed us how to configure\na couple of the servers,\n\n705\n00:33:52.145 --> 00:33:57.840\nand that it's definitely handy to have,\nbut what if I've got 500 machines?\n\n706\n00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.690\nNow what is the client experience?\n\n707\n00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:03.450\nAre you gonna have to go in and manually\nadminister to 500 individual records to be\n\n708\n00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:04.670\nable to find them on your domain?\n\n709\n00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.280\nOr is this something that's not so\n\n710\n00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.600\nadministratively challenging,\nat least for me?\n\n711\n00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:12.340\n>> Well you can certainly do it by hand,\nand if you are paid an hourly wage,\n\n712\n00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:13.000\nI recommend it.\n\n713\n00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.020\nCuz it'll keep you employed\nthe rest of your life, right?\n\n714\n00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.900\nMaintaining DNS records is a super pain,\nso\n\n715\n00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:22.200\nit's better to have your clients register\nthemselves automatically, all right.\n\n716\n00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.400\nIf you have DACP,\nit might be doing it already.\n\n717\n00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.900\nA lot of DACP servers\nare automatically update DNS.\n\n718\n00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.370\nSo they hand out an address and\n\n719\n00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:30.530\nthey add you to DNS, but\nyou can do it on the client too.\n\n720\n00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.130\nLet me show you here.\n\n721\n00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:34.510\nIf I go back into my\nSystem Preferences and\n\n722\n00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:39.230\nI go into Network,\nI assigned a static IP right here, right.\n\n723\n00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.540\nBut if you go on to Advanced and\n\n724\n00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:45.640\ngo to DNS, here's where you can have what\nDNS servers you're going to use, right?\n\n725\n00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:49.190\nSo I want to register, I want to use\nthis DNS server for doing lookups,\n\n726\n00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:54.310\nand so I can add my server, or Google,\nor whoever it is I want to add.\n\n727\n00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.120\nAnd over here you can start\nto add search domains, and\n\n728\n00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.730\nthe search domains\nare like little shortcuts.\n\n729\n00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:05.960\nIf I do a one name lookup, if I just look\nup www, what domain is that a part of?\n\n730\n00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.530\nIt doesn't know.\n\n731\n00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:09.841\nIt expects me to do www.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n732\n00:35:09.841 --> 00:35:15.617\nSo I could come in here and I could add\na search domain of lab.itpro.tv and\n\n733\n00:35:15.617 --> 00:35:18.820\nif I ever do a one name lookup.\n\n734\n00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:21.800\nIt'll automatically append this domain and\ntry that.\n\n735\n00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.100\nAnd you can add more than one and\n\n736\n00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.480\nit'll just try them all in order\nuntil it finds who we're looking for.\n\n737\n00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.000\nSo a great way to have shortcut names for\nyour systems, right?\n\n738\n00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.640\nIt also has the added effect of this\nclient trying to register with DNS.\n\n739\n00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:37.170\nIt'll say, okay, if I got that\nas my entry, I'm gonna try and\n\n740\n00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:40.540\nreach out and update and\nget that registered.\n\n741\n00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.430\nIt doesn't typically work.\n\n742\n00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:44.660\nThat's where it's better to have\na DHCP server that does it.\n\n743\n00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:50.150\nAnd we'll see some of those options in a\nDHCP episode when we go and film that one,\n\n744\n00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:53.990\nbut for right now we can set that,\nshoot, I don't think I hit Apply there.\n\n745\n00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:57.190\nBut anyhow, you had to hit Apply,\nthat would then take effect and\n\n746\n00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:58.391\nwe'd start to look up those names.\n\n747\n00:35:58.391 --> 00:36:02.510\nBut otherwise, doing the manual\nentry in here, you can do it, but\n\n748\n00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:05.000\nanytime somebody's IP changes,\nit becomes a problem.\n\n749\n00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.130\nBecause DHCP is so common, you really\ncan't keep up with this as a person.\n\n750\n00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:11.120\nLike I said, if you're an hourly employee,\nyou've got a job for\n\n751\n00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.750\nlife because it's just so\nhard to stay on top of that.\n\n752\n00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:16.100\nYou want dynamic registration to occur.\n\n753\n00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.100\n>> DNS, what a great service.\n\n754\n00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.190\nSo I don't have to have this huge laundry\nlist of IP addresses in my pocket,\n\n755\n00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.960\nevery time I wanna browse that\nanything across the Internet.\n\n756\n00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.793\nAll good information, thank you, Don.\n\n757\n00:36:25.793 --> 00:36:28.750\nIt does seem like we are coming\nto the end of this episode.\n\n758\n00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:31.934\nGot any parting words of\nwisdom before we end this one?\n\n759\n00:36:31.934 --> 00:36:32.880\n>> That's about it.\n\n760\n00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.570\nWe're gonna see more DNS especially\nwhen we get to Open Directory.\n\n761\n00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:39.250\nCuz Open Directory is really important\nto get that set properly and\n\n762\n00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:41.780\nyou will even see it,\nif you just pull out real quick.\n\n763\n00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:46.180\nI set a DNS search suffix a moment ago.\n\n764\n00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.210\nBut when you go to\nthe homepage of my server,\n\n765\n00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:51.870\nsee my hostname OSX-SERVER01.local.\n\n766\n00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:54.810\nMy server doesn't know\nthat it is lab.itpro.tv so\n\n767\n00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:57.330\nwhen we go to do open directory\nwe gotta get that straight.\n\n768\n00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:00.317\nWe're gonna se that again,\nthere'll be a lot DNS as the shows go on.\n\n769\n00:37:00.317 --> 00:37:03.049\nBut in this episode what I wanna\ndo is introduce you to the basics,\n\n770\n00:37:03.049 --> 00:37:05.879\nhow we can get a server set up,\nhow we can get some records in there and\n\n771\n00:37:05.879 --> 00:37:08.130\nget it working and that's what we've seen.\n\n772\n00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:10.150\nJust be aware that is kind\nof the tip of the iceberg,\n\n773\n00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:11.960\nthere's a lot more that\ngoes on behind the scene.\n\n774\n00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.680\n>> Well look forward to seeing that, and\nwe certainly look forward to seeing you\n\n775\n00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.590\nthere as well, but signing out here at\nITPRO.TV, I've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n776\n00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:19.550\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n777\n00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:23.152\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n778\n00:37:23.152 --> 00:37:29.480\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.510\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.280\nAnd in today's episode, we're going to be\nmoving through OS X Server Essentials.\n\n5\n00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.910\nAnd to help us out today is\nnone other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.650\nDon, welcome, and\nhow are you doing today, Sir?\n\n7\n00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.490\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n8\n00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.500\nReady to dive right back into\nthe world of OS X Server Essentials.\n\n9\n00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.910\nAnd in this episode we're gonna\ntaka a look at remote management.\n\n10\n00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.540\nAnd by remote management, what I mean\nis when you set up an OS X server,\n\n11\n00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.280\nit's likely not a computer that\nyou sit at every single day.\n\n12\n00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.960\nA very common scenario is where\npeople take Mac minis, and\n\n13\n00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.830\nthey get them set up with the Server app\ninstalled, and it's full-blown setup, and\n\n14\n00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.840\nthey stick it in a server rack somewhere.\n\n15\n00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.140\nNo keyboard, no mouse, no monitor,\n\n16\n00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.640\njust a little Mac mini sitting\nin a closet somewhere.\n\n17\n00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.120\nOr a Mac Pro, you got the big\ncylinder stuck in a closet,\n\n18\n00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.180\nobviously you gotta worry\nabout ventilation and cooling.\n\n19\n00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.840\nBut you get it put somewhere and you don't\nnecessarily have physical access to it, so\n\n20\n00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.590\nyou need a way to be able to remotely\nconnect to that server to work with it,\n\n21\n00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.020\nand you can do that from your laptop,\nfrom your desktop, from your iPad even.\n\n22\n00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.480\nThere's a lot of different ways to\nbe able to remote in and connect and\n\n23\n00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.510\nstart to manage a server.\n\n24\n00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.270\nWe have the built in ways that are a part\nof just any regular OS X install, but\n\n25\n00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.790\nthen there's a few extra little\nkinda bells and whistles I guess for\n\n26\n00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.960\nthe Server app that we'll see here\ntoday with just getting connected and\n\n27\n00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.370\nstarting to work with that system.\n\n28\n00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.960\nThis also comes in really handy\nif you have more than one server.\n\n29\n00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.800\nIf you just have one server,\nyeah you can walk over, sit down,\n\n30\n00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.610\nand start to work on it.\n\n31\n00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.640\nBut what if you have 100 servers?\n\n32\n00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.230\nWhat if you had 1000 servers?\n\n33\n00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.610\nYou don't want to have to go and\nsit at each one or have 1000 monitors,\n\n34\n00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.010\nand 1000 keyboards, and 1000 mice.\n\n35\n00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.190\nYou don't want that, right?\n\n36\n00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.420\nSo you want that headless unit to\nwhere it's just the computer and\n\n37\n00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.360\nit's tucked away in a server room, and\nthen you remotely connect and manage it.\n\n38\n00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.120\nSo you've got a lot of\ndifferent ways to do that, and\n\n39\n00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.600\nthat's what we're going to take\na look at right here in this episode.\n\n40\n00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.270\nNow, Don, with remote management,\none of the things that I've\n\n41\n00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.540\nseen in some of the other systems is,\nit could be on by default.\n\n42\n00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.470\nIs this on by default?\n\n43\n00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.810\nOr for security purposes maybe,\nis it turned off by default and\n\n44\n00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.520\nsomething that we have to enable?\n\n45\n00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.360\n>> Yes and no.\n\n46\n00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.780\n>> Okay.\n>> [LAUGH] No easy answers today.\n\n47\n00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.060\nThere's several different\ntypes of remote management.\n\n48\n00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.370\nSome are on by default, some are not,\nand so we may have to go in and\n\n49\n00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.470\nkinda tweak those.\n\n50\n00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.660\nAnd what you'll find is that,\nit's actually changed over the years.\n\n51\n00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.341\nAnd so if you're on a brand new El Capitan\nsystem, and you just installed the Server\n\n52\n00:02:30.341 --> 00:02:33.610\napp for the first time,\nmost of them are actually off by default.\n\n53\n00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.140\nThey're off and\nyou've got to turn them on.\n\n54\n00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.320\nBut if you've got a system that's been\nupgraded from Mavericks, to Yosemite,\n\n55\n00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.170\nto El Capitan from server version three,\nto four, to five, that some of them may\n\n56\n00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.050\nactually be on by default cuz they were on\nby default back in the earlier version.\n\n57\n00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.590\nSo that's kinda changed a little bit.\n\n58\n00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.870\nIt's alway a good idea to go and check and\n\n59\n00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.800\nmake sure that everything is\nset the way that you want it.\n\n60\n00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.270\nWell, when you set up a brand new server,\nwhether you want to manage it remotely or\n\n61\n00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.490\nnot, you have to start\non the server itself.\n\n62\n00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.045\nAnd you might remember from some of\nthe earlier episodes we set this up\n\n63\n00:03:05.045 --> 00:03:05.760\nwhere I said that.\n\n64\n00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.265\nI said, you've got to run the Server app\nat least one time from the server itself.\n\n65\n00:03:11.265 --> 00:03:15.250\nAnd the main reason is if you don't run it\nat least once the services don't start,\n\n66\n00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.850\nyou can't remotely manage\nsomething that's not even started.\n\n67\n00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.870\nSo we've gotta start the Server app\nat least one time on the server.\n\n68\n00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.630\nAnd once that's done,\nnow we can start to remote manage it.\n\n69\n00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.660\nWell, technically you could remote manage\nit even before you installed the Server\n\n70\n00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.550\napp because we just have remote\nmanagement built right into OS X.\n\n71\n00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.620\nRight?\nLet's kind of recap that real quick before\n\n72\n00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.410\nwe dive into the server specific stuff.\n\n73\n00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.450\nSo I've got a server pulled up here,\nand let me get out of the Server app.\n\n74\n00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.130\nSo we're going to put ourselves\ninto our regular world.\n\n75\n00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.230\nThis is a, for the most part,\na stock install of Yosemite.\n\n76\n00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.860\nI'm sorry, not Yosemite, El Capitan,\nwhatever version this is.\n\n77\n00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.490\nAnd actually, now that I've said it, let\nme make sure that this is El Capitan and\n\n78\n00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.060\nI'm not leading us down the wrong path.\n\n79\n00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.940\nYeah, it is.\nOkay.\n\n80\n00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.910\nSo this is a fairly stock install,\nand I know it doesn't look normal.\n\n81\n00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.960\nThis is something that I\nlike to do on my servers.\n\n82\n00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.890\nSo when I set up a new server, I know that\nI'm going to be remotely managing it.\n\n83\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.380\nAnd when you remotely do\nsomething like screen sharing, and\n\n84\n00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.420\nyou have that big El Capitan,\nthis wallpaper, right?\n\n85\n00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.080\nIt takes forever for\nthat to render on the screen.\n\n86\n00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.640\nAnd sometimes if you have a really poor\nVNC connection, you'll see the line going\n\n87\n00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.280\ndown the screen super slow, because it's\nhaving to draw this rich background.\n\n88\n00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.630\nSo when I set up servers, one of the first\nthings I do is turn the background off and\n\n89\n00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.660\njust go to a solid color, solid blue.\n\n90\n00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.600\nSolid blue renders super fast in VNC.\n\n91\n00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.060\nAnd then from there,\n\n92\n00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.310\nI go down to my Dock and the Dock\nnormally has all this stuff in it, right?\n\n93\n00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.880\nPhotos, and Mail, and Contacts.\n\n94\n00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.250\nI'm never gonna use any of that stuff on\nthis server, and so I remove that and\n\n95\n00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.250\nI put the server stuff down there, right?\n\n96\n00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.620\nThings that I will use,\nlike Network Utility and\n\n97\n00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.290\nthe Server app, Remote Desktop,\nif I've got that installed, The App Store.\n\n98\n00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.050\nThese are things that I know I'll use.\n\n99\n00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.020\nAnd now I've got a much\nmore simplified interface.\n\n100\n00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.790\nIt's a little more server like.\n\n101\n00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.550\nBut all I've really done is\ninstalled the Server app.\n\n102\n00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.550\nNow, ever if I hadn't\ninstalled the Server app,\n\n103\n00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.250\nwe can use the Mac's remote\nmanagement features.\n\n104\n00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.180\nIf you go into system preferences,\ninside of system preferences,\n\n105\n00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.190\nyou've got the Sharing utility,\nor control panel.\n\n106\n00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.810\nAnd if I go into that Sharing utility,\n\n107\n00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.780\nright from here I can see\ndifferent things that I can share.\n\n108\n00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.650\nAnd for remote management, there's\njust a handful of these that matter.\n\n109\n00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.330\nDVD or CD sharing,\nthat really doesn't apply here.\n\n110\n00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.760\nThat's not gonna help me remote manage\nthis system, but screen sharing will.\n\n111\n00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.170\nIf I can do screen sharing, then via\nVNC I can connect over the network and\n\n112\n00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.820\nview the screen of this system.\n\n113\n00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.580\nI don't need the Server app for that.\n\n114\n00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.010\nSo that's the first way that\nwe can remote manage this.\n\n115\n00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.860\nI might be deploying 100 Macs, and\nI want all of them to be servers, but\n\n116\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.310\nI haven't put the Server app on them yet.\n\n117\n00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.220\nSo I can turn on screen sharing,\nand now I can VNC into them, and\n\n118\n00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.000\nstart to see them work.\n\n119\n00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.900\nIf you haven't used that before,\nthe system's really easy.\n\n120\n00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:53.860\nLet me just show you.\n\n121\n00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.490\nI'm gonna turn that on.\n\n122\n00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.940\nAnd when you turn on screen sharing,\nyou've got some basic settings over here,\n\n123\n00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.720\nand there's not all that much\nyou have to worry about.\n\n124\n00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.100\nFirst off, who's allowed to do it?\n\n125\n00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.620\nDo I want to allow everybody to be\nable to connect to this screen, or\n\n126\n00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.370\njust certain users?\n\n127\n00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.020\nThe default is just administrators,\nand that's normally what we want.\n\n128\n00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.750\nIf I'm gonna administer their system,\nI have an administrative account.\n\n129\n00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.890\nI want to pull up the screen.\n\n130\n00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.080\nI don't want regular users connecting.\n\n131\n00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.000\nSo that's probably what we want.\n\n132\n00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.330\nYou can say All Users or\nyou can add other users here too.\n\n133\n00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.042\nNow, the technology behind\nthe scenes is VNC, so\n\n134\n00:06:25.042 --> 00:06:28.210\nyou can kind of see that in\nthe little URL they give us.\n\n135\n00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.190\nAnd that little note there,\nit's Virtual Network Computing.\n\n136\n00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.080\nIt's a program, protocol?\n\n137\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.840\nIt's actually both,\n\n138\n00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.820\nI guess, that came out of AT&T, which was\nwhere it was originally developed it and\n\n139\n00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.990\nthey kind of released it, not, well, it's\nsort of open-sourced, but it's not free.\n\n140\n00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.214\nIt's one of those weird license things.\n\n141\n00:06:47.214 --> 00:06:49.530\nBut the point is that anybody can run it.\n\n142\n00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.620\nSo we use in on Macs.\n\n143\n00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.830\nWe use it all the time.\n\n144\n00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.070\nBut Windows and Linux can use it also.\n\n145\n00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.030\nThe problem is Windows and Linux aren't\ngonna recognize these Mac usernames and\n\n146\n00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.830\npasswords.\n\n147\n00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.530\nSo if you want Windows and\nLinux to be able to connect,\n\n148\n00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:04.195\nyou can go into Computer Settings,\nand you can setup a VNC password.\n\n149\n00:07:04.195 --> 00:07:06.185\nAnd that's what Linux and\nWindows are gonna expect.\n\n150\n00:07:06.185 --> 00:07:08.715\nAnd so you can turn that on and\nspecify a password, and\n\n151\n00:07:08.715 --> 00:07:09.845\nnow a Windows user can connect.\n\n152\n00:07:09.845 --> 00:07:12.665\nThey can provide that password,\nand now they'll see the screen.\n\n153\n00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:17.035\nAll right, but on our Macs,\nwe can just use our regular accounts.\n\n154\n00:07:17.035 --> 00:07:20.570\nSo when I turn that option on,\nI can turn on screen sharing, and\n\n155\n00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.060\nthen I can jump over to a different Mac.\n\n156\n00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.370\nSo let me jump over to this work station.\n\n157\n00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.570\nAnd if I fire up my finder,\nI can start to browse the network.\n\n158\n00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.800\nAnd in my network, if I look under shared\nover here, I can find that server.\n\n159\n00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.760\nAnd I should have paid\nattention to his name.\n\n160\n00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.350\nThere it is.\n\n161\n00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.317\nOSX-Server01.\n\n162\n00:07:39.317 --> 00:07:43.510\nAnd when I click on it, I don't have any\nfolder shares, nothing shows up there, but\n\n163\n00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.080\nI have a Share Screen button right here.\n\n164\n00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.511\nAnd I can hit Share Screen, and it's gonna\nconnect over the network to that system,\n\n165\n00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.655\nand it's gonna ask me for\na username and a password.\n\n166\n00:07:51.655 --> 00:07:56.639\nSo I'm gonna provide a valid\nadministrator username and a password,\n\n167\n00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:00.368\nand I can save that if I want to and\nthen I can connect.\n\n168\n00:08:00.368 --> 00:08:04.370\nAssuming I get it right then\nI'll actually get connected.\n\n169\n00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.000\nAll right so apparently I don't\nknow my user name and password.\n\n170\n00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.335\nSo this is OS 10 Server 1.\n\n171\n00:08:11.335 --> 00:08:13.810\nAnd I'm gonna go and\ncreate a user account for myself.\n\n172\n00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.120\nSo if I go under users and\n\n173\n00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.530\ngroups I can say the account's actually\ncalled Don Pizet, not Help Desk.\n\n174\n00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.039\nSo that'll probably be a difference right\nthere is if I use the right user name.\n\n175\n00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.970\nAnd get connected.\n\n176\n00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:26.550\nThere we go.\n\n177\n00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.580\nNow, I'm still on my desktop or laptop.\n\n178\n00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.978\nRight.\nI'm using my own machine, but\n\n179\n00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:33.404\nnow I see the screen of that server.\n\n180\n00:08:33.404 --> 00:08:36.104\nEven if it didn't have the server app,\nnow I can go into the app store and\n\n181\n00:08:36.104 --> 00:08:37.240\nI can install the server app.\n\n182\n00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.480\nSo here's my first way\nI can see the screen,\n\n183\n00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.760\nas if I was sitting right\nin front of the machine.\n\n184\n00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.660\nIt might be in a server\nrack 1,000 miles away.\n\n185\n00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.950\nBut now it's like I'm sitting right in\nfront of it, and I'm using my monitor and\n\n186\n00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:52.180\nmy keyboard and my mouse, or touchpad\nin this case, I'm using my resources.\n\n187\n00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.600\nI don't have to have it on the server.\n\n188\n00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.580\nThe server can be a headless unit, and\nwe just remote connect and manage it,\n\n189\n00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.040\nand that works great unless your network\nfails and then it doesn't work so\n\n190\n00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.240\ngreat, but this is a great way to\nreach out and manage that system.\n\n191\n00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.750\n>> Well that was some of the pros.\n\n192\n00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.310\nI'm going to play devil's\nadvocate on this one Don.\n\n193\n00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:10.640\nAre there any drawbacks?\n\n194\n00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.690\nOne of the things that I\nthink of when I think of VNC,\n\n195\n00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.310\nare there any security concerns\nwith using the VNC protocol?\n\n196\n00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.099\n>> There can be.\n\n197\n00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:21.210\nYou know, a few things about VNC,\nit's kind of slow.\n\n198\n00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.920\nIt's not the fastest, like if I were to\nstart to play a video on that server,\n\n199\n00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.080\nVNC chokes on that.\n\n200\n00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.350\nYou know, It's not as fast as some of\nthe other screen sharing products that\n\n201\n00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:31.900\nare out there.\n\n202\n00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.480\nOn the security side, when you remote in,\nif you're going Mac to Mac,\n\n203\n00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.020\nyou have to provide a username and\na password.\n\n204\n00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.890\nWell, if I were to sit down\nin front of a machine,\n\n205\n00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.950\nI'd have to provide a username and\na password, right?\n\n206\n00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:46.340\nWell, so it's the same level of security,\nisn't it?\n\n207\n00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.090\nNot exactly.\n\n208\n00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.630\nI'd have to physically sit in front of\nthe machine to get to a user prompt,\n\n209\n00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.310\nto get to that login screen.\n\n210\n00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.220\nSo I can have physical security\nstopping somebody, but\n\n211\n00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.540\non the network side,\nI don't have physical security.\n\n212\n00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.500\nSomebody could be anywhere on my network,\nsomebody could be in the mail room,\n\n213\n00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.630\nand they fire up VNC and they try and\ncan connect to the server.\n\n214\n00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.160\nAnd if they have a valid username and\na password, they can get in.\n\n215\n00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.270\nSo I still have that username and\nthat password, I still have that security.\n\n216\n00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:15.100\nBut you'll probably wanna restrict\nwho can connect in via VNC.\n\n217\n00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:15.880\nRight?\n\n218\n00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.620\nAnd we don't have a great way\nto do that from right here.\n\n219\n00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.130\nActually, let me disconnect.\n\n220\n00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.270\nIt's kinda like that movie Inception.\n\n221\n00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.590\nYou start remoting into machines and\n\n222\n00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.190\nyou kinda get lost with how\nmany you're connected to.\n\n223\n00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.790\nBut when I come in here and\n\n224\n00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:33.950\nI set up that sharing side of things what\nit let me do, is pick the user accounts.\n\n225\n00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:37.290\nI couldn't really restrict who\ncould connect to it, right?\n\n226\n00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.570\nSo we can actually configure\nthis through the server app and\n\n227\n00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.230\nit's a little bit different, right?\n\n228\n00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.980\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n229\n00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.160\nI'm gonna turn that back off.\n\n230\n00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.610\nOkay, so screen sharing is now off and\nI'm gonna go into my server app.\n\n231\n00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.040\nAnd in the server app once I\nget connected to that server,\n\n232\n00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.610\nlet me just punch this in and I'll break\nsecurity protocol and save my password.\n\n233\n00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.230\nAnd I'm going to get connected to it and\n\n234\n00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.850\nI'm gonna go into the settings\nof the server app.\n\n235\n00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:06.370\nSo here's the main homepage of the server\nwhere I see the description and\n\n236\n00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:10.410\nall that and I'm not running any services,\nthis is a clean install of the server app.\n\n237\n00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.390\nSo everything's at its default.\n\n238\n00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.347\nIf I go to the settings tab you'll\nsee right here Screen sharing and\n\n239\n00:11:16.347 --> 00:11:19.183\nApple Remote Desktop app and\nI can turn that on.\n\n240\n00:11:19.183 --> 00:11:24.105\nOkay now when I turn that on that's\nthe same screen sharing from the other\n\n241\n00:11:24.105 --> 00:11:28.957\nside right so if I turn that on just\nlike checking that little box right.\n\n242\n00:11:28.957 --> 00:11:35.030\nNow I got screen sharing turned on and if\nI go back into my System Preferences and\n\n243\n00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:39.092\nI go into Sharing, well,\nScreen Sharing is not on.\n\n244\n00:11:39.092 --> 00:11:39.731\nRight?\n\n245\n00:11:39.731 --> 00:11:42.246\nAnd it's telling me Screen Sharing\nis currently being controlled by\n\n246\n00:11:42.246 --> 00:11:43.504\nthe Remote Management service and\n\n247\n00:11:43.504 --> 00:11:46.080\nI see right down here\nRemote Management has been turned on.\n\n248\n00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:46.720\nRight?\n\n249\n00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.330\nRemote Management does more\nthan just screen sharing.\n\n250\n00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:55.410\nIt also allows you to run the server\napp on a separate system, and\n\n251\n00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.030\nconnect up and manage that server.\n\n252\n00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.500\nSo now I don't have to be on\nthe server itself to use the GUI.\n\n253\n00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.437\nI don't even have to use VNC.\n\n254\n00:12:03.437 --> 00:12:05.601\nI can actually run\nthe server app itself and\n\n255\n00:12:05.601 --> 00:12:08.030\nconnect over the network to this system.\n\n256\n00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.850\nSo it's a little extra method for\nconnecting.\n\n257\n00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.490\nAnd it's different than\njust basic screen sharing.\n\n258\n00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.720\nStill using VNC under the hood but\n\n259\n00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.315\nnow it's being managed\nseparately right from here.\n\n260\n00:12:19.315 --> 00:12:22.140\nAnd you'll see some of the other\noptions that we've got.\n\n261\n00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:26.930\nUse Server app on a remote Mac It's rolled\ninto that same management service but\n\n262\n00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:28.140\nI do have to turn it on.\n\n263\n00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.240\nThe first one is for Screen Sharing, the\nsecond one is for that Server app and so\n\n264\n00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.450\nI'm gonna enable that.\n\n265\n00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.673\nAnd a third option here is\nthe secure shell, which is SSH.\n\n266\n00:12:35.673 --> 00:12:39.070\nI can open up an encrypted\nshell connection to the server.\n\n267\n00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.510\nAnd if you're running automated scripts,\nif you're trying to do things like that,\n\n268\n00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.770\nSSH really comes in handy.\n\n269\n00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.310\nApple Remote Desktop can do that too.\n\n270\n00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.960\nI can just use Apple Remote Desktop\nto push out shell commands to many,\n\n271\n00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.030\nmany systems.\n\n272\n00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:54.120\nBut having it turned on, lets me\nconnect and run things manually myself.\n\n273\n00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.220\nSo, it's another way to get in there and\nconnect to it.\n\n274\n00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.710\nSo, those are three management\nmethods that we can turn on\n\n275\n00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.300\nright here from inside\nof the server app and\n\n276\n00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:07.590\nthose have effects back here under\nour sharing system preference, right?\n\n277\n00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.260\nAnd so\nyou'll see remote log in is now on also.\n\n278\n00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.360\nThat was part of SSH.\n\n279\n00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.432\nSee how it's got remote login here.\n\n280\n00:13:13.432 --> 00:13:17.960\nSSH, and it's telling me how to\nlog in if I want to connect.\n\n281\n00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.870\nThose are couple of different ways that\nwe can remotely manage the system or\n\n282\n00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:22.470\nconnect to it.\n\n283\n00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:26.670\nNow, I've got them turned on,\nlet's see them in action.\n\n284\n00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.240\nWe saw screen sharing,\nI did that one a moment ago so\n\n285\n00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.070\nthat one is not too spectacular.\n\n286\n00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:34.020\nIt's turned on a different way though,\nso let's verify that it still works.\n\n287\n00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:39.150\nIf I go to that OSX SERVER01 and\nI hit share screen, it's asking for\n\n288\n00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:43.110\na username and a password and\nI'll connect, and I connect up just find.\n\n289\n00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:45.640\nNever mind the fact that\nscreen sharing is not checked,\n\n290\n00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.010\nit's because it's now part\nof remote management.\n\n291\n00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.240\nAnd it is checked there, it is turned on.\n\n292\n00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.726\nAnd only Don Pezet okay.\n\n293\n00:13:53.726 --> 00:13:57.730\nThen let's try some other\nconnection method so\n\n294\n00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:02.780\nI'm gonna whoops [LAUGH]\nlet me get out of this\n\n295\n00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.350\nshoot, you know what, I'm losing track,\n\n296\n00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.230\nsee it's easy to lose track of\nwhich machine you're connected to.\n\n297\n00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:11.720\nAll right.\nSo I'm gonna get back to my desktop.\n\n298\n00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.960\nThere we go.\n\n299\n00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.460\nAnd now let's try some of the other\nconnection methods, right?\n\n300\n00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.900\nSo the screen sharing was one.\n\n301\n00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.440\nSSH, the Shell,\nthat was another one, right?\n\n302\n00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.660\nSo if I fire up my terminal, so\nI'm gonna just launch my terminal here.\n\n303\n00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.750\nIn the terminal I can\nopen up a shell session.\n\n304\n00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:33.450\nNow what I am on right now\nis my own desktop, right.\n\n305\n00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.960\nSo if I do a little host name command.\n\n306\n00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.715\nYou can see I'm on donsmac.local, right.\n\n307\n00:14:38.715 --> 00:14:42.391\nThis is just my regular work station\nI don't think I have the server app\n\n308\n00:14:42.391 --> 00:14:46.510\ninstalled on this and I don't, okay,\nso I don't have the server app.\n\n309\n00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.600\nIs just me and here we go all right.\n\n310\n00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:53.980\nFrom here I can do SSH followed by my\n\n311\n00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:58.240\nusername on the other system now remember\nthat there's two forms of a username.\n\n312\n00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.160\nThere's a nice pretty name\nthat you see in the GUI and\n\n313\n00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.740\nthen there's a Unix\nname behind the scenes.\n\n314\n00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:08.200\nAnd so back over here on the server,\nif I go on to my system preferences and\n\n315\n00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.190\nI go to users and groups and\nI find that Don Pezet account,\n\n316\n00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:15.560\nI see the nice pretty name,\nthat Mac name that we see.\n\n317\n00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.490\nLet me unlock this real quick.\n\n318\n00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:26.540\nBut if I take that user and control click\non it, you'll get advanced options.\n\n319\n00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.990\nAnd under advanced options,\nI'll see the UNIX name.\n\n320\n00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.440\nThat's the true username for that account.\n\n321\n00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.070\nAnd the UNIX name can't have spaces.\n\n322\n00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.920\nAnd that's why we have two usernames.\n\n323\n00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:42.510\nYou have a full name that we see in\nthe GUI, and a Unix name that we see here.\n\n324\n00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:46.300\nNow on the Apple prompt, so\nyou can actually use either one.\n\n325\n00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:46.860\nSo for example,\n\n326\n00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.700\nwhen I do screen sharing, I can use\neither one of these names that we find.\n\n327\n00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.180\nBut in the command line,\nyou always have to use the Unix name.\n\n328\n00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.210\nI've gotta use dpezet.\n\n329\n00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:58.049\nSo, but it's important to remember\nthat your account has two names.\n\n330\n00:15:58.049 --> 00:16:00.960\nAnd you can see that a little\neasier in the server app itself.\n\n331\n00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.465\nLike if I go under the server app and\nI go to the user accounts in there,\n\n332\n00:16:04.465 --> 00:16:08.800\nwell you can just see right there\nI'm logging in with that full name.\n\n333\n00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.540\nBut in here if I go to my users there,\nthe Don Pezet account, and\n\n334\n00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.730\nif I edit that account I can see\nthe account name right there.\n\n335\n00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:16.920\nI don't have to go to anything special,\n\n336\n00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.559\nbecause on the server app they\nassume you need to see that data.\n\n337\n00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:25.920\nSo I jump back over to my client though,\nI can ssh with username dpezet@ and\n\n338\n00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.340\nthen I can put in the IP address or\nhostname of that server, and\n\n339\n00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.840\nit's gonna reach out and connect to it.\n\n340\n00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.320\nNow, what ssh is gonna do is it's\ngonna open up a shell session,\n\n341\n00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.370\nlike a terminal on that other server.\n\n342\n00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.870\nAnd it's gotta use\ncertificates to encrypt it.\n\n343\n00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:44.340\nAnd so it's showing me the certificate\nfingerprint for that other server, and\n\n344\n00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:44.860\nit's saying, hey,\n\n345\n00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:50.170\nyou've never connected to this guy before,\nis this right, is that the server?\n\n346\n00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:52.760\nI'm gonna say yes to it so\nthat I can get connected.\n\n347\n00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.500\nOops, and then I'm gonna just press Enter\na bunch instead of typing in a password.\n\n348\n00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.090\nSo I'm gonna say yes to it to go ahead and\nget connected.\n\n349\n00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:00.775\nAnd see how it didn't ask me\nabout the certificate this time?\n\n350\n00:17:00.775 --> 00:17:04.320\nCuz it's already got it on file and\nit matches what I connected to.\n\n351\n00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.230\nIf that server certificate were to ever\nchange, we would assume that system was\n\n352\n00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.900\ncompromised and\nit would stop me from connecting.\n\n353\n00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:15.730\nBut now I can go ahead and connect and now\nI've got a shell session on the server.\n\n354\n00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:22.420\nSee how my prompt was Don's Mac,\nand now my prompt is OSX-SERVER01.\n\n355\n00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:27.290\nAnd if I run hostname,\nI can see it actually on that server.\n\n356\n00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.580\nAnd I can start running applications or\nprograms,\n\n357\n00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:32.900\nI can perform actions like copy files.\n\n358\n00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.340\nAnd I can do it all right\nhere from the shell.\n\n359\n00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:39.880\nFor example if I get into\nmy desktop folder, and\n\n360\n00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.720\nit's empty right now, so when I look\nat my desktop over here, let me\n\n361\n00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:48.830\njust minimize this, there's nothing on my\ndesktop except for that hard drive icon.\n\n362\n00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:53.460\nBut, if I come in here and\nI create a file, so I'll say file.text and\n\n363\n00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.650\nI jump back over here, there's file.text.\n\n364\n00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.260\nI'm working on that server remotely.\n\n365\n00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.710\nWell, screensharing,\nthat gives us a nice little GUI.\n\n366\n00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:06.820\nWe get that graphical interface to\nsee the server, and that's great.\n\n367\n00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.340\nSSH, we see the terminal, right?\n\n368\n00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.990\nSo if I wanna remotely see the GUI,\nI use VNC and screen sharing.\n\n369\n00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.950\nIf I wanna see the terminal, I use SSH.\n\n370\n00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:19.410\nSSH is fully encrypted and\nsecure and very very fast so\n\n371\n00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.030\nI find that I use it\na lot more than others.\n\n372\n00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.730\nBut there are some things you\nwanna do from the GUI and\n\n373\n00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.220\nwell, that kind of works out.\n\n374\n00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:30.003\nNow, in between the two,\nin between the terminal and\n\n375\n00:18:30.003 --> 00:18:33.860\nthe screen sharing is\nthe server app itself.\n\n376\n00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.660\nI can use the server app to remotely\nconnect to a server and manage it.\n\n377\n00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.530\nI don't see the desktop, I don't see\nthe terminal, but I see the server app and\n\n378\n00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.880\nall the different things inside\nof it that I can use to manage.\n\n379\n00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.242\nLet me show you how that works.\n\n380\n00:18:46.242 --> 00:18:48.820\nI'm gonna jump back over\nto my workstation here.\n\n381\n00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.850\nAnd my workstation doesn't have\nthe server app installed, so\n\n382\n00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.050\nI'm gonna have to get it.\n\n383\n00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:55.570\nI could go and\ndownload it from the app store, or\n\n384\n00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:59.070\nI could just copy it from the server,\nthe server has it.\n\n385\n00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:03.290\nSo I could come in here onto my server and\n\n386\n00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:08.010\ngo into my applications and find that\nserver app, and I'm just gonna copy it.\n\n387\n00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.890\nAnd I'll go and create a new folder\nsomewhere, maybe in my Documents.\n\n388\n00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:16.350\nSo, which I'll just call\nthe Server App folder.\n\n389\n00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:21.750\nAnd I'm gonna paste a copy of the server\napp right there, so it's pasting away.\n\n390\n00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:26.190\nAnd doing stuff and\neventually it will finish, sooner or\n\n391\n00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.550\nlater, there we go, so it's copying over.\n\n392\n00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:31.134\nThen what I can do is I can share\nthis folder on the network, and\n\n393\n00:19:31.134 --> 00:19:33.391\nfor my other systems I can\njust get it right from here.\n\n394\n00:19:33.391 --> 00:19:37.465\nNow, you have to purchase the server app\nso it assumes that you have to be logged\n\n395\n00:19:37.465 --> 00:19:41.350\nin and all that, so you've gotta\ntake those steps ahead of time.\n\n396\n00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:45.100\nBut this does save me from having to\ndownload it across the internet again.\n\n397\n00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.906\nSo I'm gonna go in here and oop, I think\nI forgot to share the folder, didn't I?\n\n398\n00:19:47.906 --> 00:19:51.000\nIf I don't share the folder I'm going\nto have a hard time getting to it,\n\n399\n00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.178\nI guess I could have put\nit in my public folder.\n\n400\n00:19:53.178 --> 00:19:54.375\nWell, whatever.\n\n401\n00:19:54.375 --> 00:19:57.110\nLet me just share this out real quick.\n\n402\n00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.440\nAnd once it's shared out we'll just\nbrowse over and get a copy of it and\n\n403\n00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.470\nwe'll be in business.\n\n404\n00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.840\nI'm gonna turn on my file sharing.\n\n405\n00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.870\nI am gonna add my Documents folder and\nServer App.\n\n406\n00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.320\nThere we go.\n\n407\n00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:16.540\nAnd now back here on my desktop,\nI can just browse to that server, and\n\n408\n00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.425\nI do need to login so\nI'm gonna hit Connect As.\n\n409\n00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:20.920\nAnd punch in my account.\n\n410\n00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:29.066\nAnd there's Server App, Which I'm just\ngonna copy into my Applications folder.\n\n411\n00:20:29.066 --> 00:20:31.690\nSo there it goes, copying away.\n\n412\n00:20:33.988 --> 00:20:37.253\nNow, I'm gonna run the Server App, and\nthe most sensitive part is right here at\n\n413\n00:20:37.253 --> 00:20:40.499\nthe beginning, because what happens when\nI run the server app the first time?\n\n414\n00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:45.580\nIt installs all those services,\nit gets them ready.\n\n415\n00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:49.080\nIt doesn't turn them on, right, we have\nto turn the services on ourselves, but\n\n416\n00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.580\nit turns your system into a server.\n\n417\n00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.940\nI don't wanna be a server!\n\n418\n00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:57.190\nI just want to remotely manage\nthe server on my network.\n\n419\n00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:01.330\nSo I'm gonna run this program and\nwhen it runs,\n\n420\n00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:06.420\nI have to be really careful to\nnot tell it to connect to myself.\n\n421\n00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.870\nWhile we're waiting on that,\nlet me jump back here to the server.\n\n422\n00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.130\nOn the server,\nlet me get out of the server app and\n\n423\n00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:13.080\nI'll show you what\nhappens when I launch it.\n\n424\n00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:17.610\nWhen I launch the server app,\nit brings me, shoot,\n\n425\n00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:21.320\nI set it to automatically\nconnect to the server, shoot.\n\n426\n00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:21.970\nIn the server app,\n\n427\n00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:26.980\nyou can tell it to automatically connect\nto the server, which is what mine did.\n\n428\n00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.150\nIf you don't then what you're going\nto see when you first launch it is\n\n429\n00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:29.990\nthis screen right here.\n\n430\n00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:33.992\nAnd the first option is to\nconnect to this Mac and\n\n431\n00:21:33.992 --> 00:21:37.750\nif you do that It's gonna\nturn that Mac into a server.\n\n432\n00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.290\nSo if run it on my workstation and\nI choose this Mac,\n\n433\n00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:46.340\nit's gonna connect to itself and I'm now\ngonna manage turning myself into a server.\n\n434\n00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.304\nI don't want that,\ninstead I gotta to choose Other Mac.\n\n435\n00:21:48.304 --> 00:21:52.402\nAnd you can choose Other Mac and you can\npick a different system on the network.\n\n436\n00:21:52.402 --> 00:21:56.470\nBoy, that's like the slowest copy ever,\nlet me try from my regular desktop.\n\n437\n00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:58.840\nSo this is my actual laptop.\n\n438\n00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.160\nAnd, so if I fire up my server app here,\n\n439\n00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.350\nwhen I go to launch that it's\ngonna fire up a server app, and\n\n440\n00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:10.410\nI don't want to turn myself into a server,\nalthough I already am.\n\n441\n00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.490\nIn fact it's going in and\nconnecting right now, but\n\n442\n00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:15.175\nI can tell it to look\nat this other server.\n\n443\n00:22:15.175 --> 00:22:19.088\nAnd if you have a hundred servers,\nyou can sit there and pick each server and\n\n444\n00:22:19.088 --> 00:22:23.003\ngo through and manage them using\nthe server app right from your own laptop,\n\n445\n00:22:23.003 --> 00:22:24.019\nand, there we go.\n\n446\n00:22:24.019 --> 00:22:27.939\nSo I'm just gonna cancel out of that, and\nI'll choose Other Mac, and actually, I\n\n447\n00:22:27.939 --> 00:22:32.910\ndon't even have to do Other Mac, cuz I can\nsee, OSX-SERVER01 right here, it found it.\n\n448\n00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:35.730\nThe server app uses Bonjour,\nit's scanning the network.\n\n449\n00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.533\nIf the server is on the same\nnetwork as you, it'll find it and\n\n450\n00:22:38.533 --> 00:22:41.070\nit'll show up right here on the list.\n\n451\n00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:47.070\nIn fact, look at this one\nDon-Pezets-Mac-Mini 10.10.1.224.\n\n452\n00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:50.030\nThat is my Mac Mini at home.\n\n453\n00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.700\nThat's not even here in the office\nwith me and it's showing up.\n\n454\n00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.920\nNow, how do I see that if it's\nnot even here in the office?\n\n455\n00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.410\nI'm not VPN'ed into home or anything.\n\n456\n00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:02.290\nWell, I'm logged in with my Apple ID\non my little Mac mini server at home.\n\n457\n00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:07.220\nAnd I'm logging with my Apple ID right\nhere in the office, and so I see it.\n\n458\n00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:11.540\nI see it because Apple is\nconnecting me through iCloud.\n\n459\n00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.070\nSo, iCloud lets you remotely find your\nservers to be able to manage them.\n\n460\n00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:18.190\nThat's at home,\ncompletely separate network.\n\n461\n00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:21.336\nI've got a firewall at home,\nthere's a firewall here at the office, and\n\n462\n00:23:21.336 --> 00:23:22.035\nI still see it.\n\n463\n00:23:22.035 --> 00:23:26.350\nOSX-SERVER01, that's the virtual\nmachine that's right here, local.\n\n464\n00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.010\nSo, of course I'm gonna find that.\n\n465\n00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:29.600\nBut even remote ones we can find.\n\n466\n00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.950\n>> Now Don, what happens,\nI'm thinking connection, right.\n\n467\n00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.770\nHow do I know that I can\nactually trust those machines?\n\n468\n00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:40.160\nCouldn't somebody theoretically\nput something in my network, and\n\n469\n00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:45.160\nyou see that or connect to it,\nwe have security concerns on connecting.\n\n470\n00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.280\n>> Yes, they're there and\nyou can make use of them.\n\n471\n00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.100\nA lot of people say well, it's on my\nown network, I trust my own network.\n\n472\n00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.410\nAnd that's enough.\n\n473\n00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:54.740\nFor this remote one,\nit's tied to my Apple ID.\n\n474\n00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.352\nSo I know that that's safe,\nI've authenticated.\n\n475\n00:23:56.352 --> 00:23:59.090\nSomebody else would have\nto have my password.\n\n476\n00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.691\nAnd if they did, I'd have bigger problems\nthan them spoofing my server, right?\n\n477\n00:24:01.691 --> 00:24:03.153\n>> Gotcha.\n\n478\n00:24:03.153 --> 00:24:07.998\n>> As far as this local one though,\nhow do I know it's not Nate,\n\n479\n00:24:07.998 --> 00:24:11.430\nour producer, pulling a prank on me?\n\n480\n00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:13.700\nAnd he's brought up a server\ncalled OSX-SERVER01,\n\n481\n00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.870\njust giggling like crazy out there going,\nI can't wait till Don brings this up on\n\n482\n00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:20.610\nthe screen on the show and he's made\nnaughty folders on there or something.\n\n483\n00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:25.610\nWell, I don't really know based on\nthis name, but the very first time\n\n484\n00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:30.680\nI connect I cache the certificate,\nthe security certificate for that system.\n\n485\n00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.683\nWe saw that when I did SSH.\n\n486\n00:24:31.683 --> 00:24:35.520\nAnd if that security certificate\ndoesn't match I'll get a warning.\n\n487\n00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.789\nA warning will pop up saying warning,\nthis certificate has changed from the last\n\n488\n00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:42.571\ntime, and\nthat's my cue to say something is wrong.\n\n489\n00:24:42.571 --> 00:24:45.310\nThis is not necessarily\nthe system I am connected to.\n\n490\n00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.260\nNow that certificate, we are going to\ntalk about those more in the certificate\n\n491\n00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:52.140\nepisode, but when you install OS X,\nthe server app it creates\n\n492\n00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:56.660\nwhat we call a self signed certificate\nit makes one up out of thin air.\n\n493\n00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:58.860\nIt makes one up and\nsticks it on the server.\n\n494\n00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:02.410\nSo the first time you can act you don't\nreally have a great way to know whether\n\n495\n00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:05.040\nyou should trust it or\nnot because it's a made up certificate.\n\n496\n00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:09.520\nBut every time after that it's\na certificate that you've seen in the past\n\n497\n00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.120\nand so you'll notice if it changes.\n\n498\n00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.270\nThat's where that security comes from,\nall right?\n\n499\n00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.599\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose that OS X Server 01 Local.\n\n500\n00:25:16.599 --> 00:25:18.520\nNow, actually let me\npoint out one more thing.\n\n501\n00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.120\nWhat if it didn't show up in the list,\nright?\n\n502\n00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:25.880\nWhat if I'm on one subnet, the server's on\na different subnet, I'm logged in with one\n\n503\n00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.350\nApple ID, the server's logged\nin with a different Apple ID?\n\n504\n00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:31.840\nI'm not gonna find it, it's on a different\nnetwork, how do I know it's there, right?\n\n505\n00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.490\nBut that's where you can choose Other Mac,\nand when you choose Other Mac you're gonna\n\n506\n00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:39.280\nhit Continue, and you can provide\nthe IP address to that system.\n\n507\n00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.000\nAnd so now it doesn't matter if\nBonjour can see it or not, and\n\n508\n00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.300\nit doesn't matter what\nApple ID it's logged in with,\n\n509\n00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:49.370\nyou can punch in the IP address and\na username and get connected, okay?\n\n510\n00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:50.500\nSo I'm gonna punch that in there and\n\n511\n00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.980\nget connected and\nit's gonna reach out and do it.\n\n512\n00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:54.890\nNow a quick word of caution,\nwe'll see if I bump into this,\n\n513\n00:25:56.110 --> 00:26:01.860\nyour server app needs to be the same\nversion as the server's or newer.\n\n514\n00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.080\nIf you're running an older version of\nthe server app and you're connecting to\n\n515\n00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.270\na newer version of the server,\nthen it's not gonna be able to connect.\n\n516\n00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:10.040\nSo you're gonna have problems there.\n\n517\n00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.570\nNow this is the first time I've\nconnected to this server, and\n\n518\n00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.650\nhere's the certificate\nwarning I was mentioning.\n\n519\n00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:17.940\nIt says, you're connecting to a server\nwhose identity certificate isn't valid.\n\n520\n00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.080\nWe don't trust it, it's made up, right?\n\n521\n00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.730\nIt could be a Mac server with\na self-signed certificate.\n\n522\n00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.370\nDing, ding, ding,\nthat's exactly what it is.\n\n523\n00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:30.560\nAnd then, it also might be a server\nthat's pretending to be 192.168.0.151.\n\n524\n00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.620\nWell, I created it, I trust it right\nnow so I'll go ahead and say okay.\n\n525\n00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.650\nAnd it's just telling me I can put my\nconfidential information at risk if it's\n\n526\n00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:37.620\na pretender.\n\n527\n00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.110\nDo I want to connect anyway?\n\n528\n00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.560\nAnd I can show the certificate\nto look at it and\n\n529\n00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.770\nverify if it's right and continue on.\n\n530\n00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:47.730\n>> Now Don, what if our company\nenterprise level has an internal PKI,\n\n531\n00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:50.750\ncould we maybe use our own certificates?\n\n532\n00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.930\n>> You certainly could and what we'll\nsee in the certificates episode is\n\n533\n00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:58.320\na PKI is a public key infrastructure to\nwhere you create trusted certificates.\n\n534\n00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.850\nThese are untrusted here,\nthat's why I'm getting the warning, right?\n\n535\n00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.230\nBut a trusted one I wouldn't\nhave even seen this warning,\n\n536\n00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:07.480\nit would have just continued on and\nconnected cuz it trusted the certificate.\n\n537\n00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.970\nBut it takes a lot to get that set up, so\n\n538\n00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.830\nwe'll talk more about that in\nthe certificate episode and\n\n539\n00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.230\nget a chance to see that.\n\n540\n00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:17.320\nBut once I'm connected I'm now\nusing that self sign cert right.\n\n541\n00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.240\nAnd so I'm connected with a secure\nconnection to the server,\n\n542\n00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.390\nthis is encrypted, and\nnow I'm looking at the server app.\n\n543\n00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:25.220\nNow, I'm on my own desktop here, right?\n\n544\n00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:29.790\nI'm on my laptop, and\nI'm connected to that server, and\n\n545\n00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:31.546\nI can go in and\nI can start to configure things.\n\n546\n00:27:31.546 --> 00:27:35.330\nI can configure, well, file sharing is\nalready turned on, but maybe I can turn\n\n547\n00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:39.350\non mail or messages, VPN, I can jump\nin and start to configure this stuff.\n\n548\n00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.580\nMaybe I wanna be a DNS server so\nI'll go and turn that on,\n\n549\n00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.430\nright, and I'm doing that\nright here from my own laptop.\n\n550\n00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.700\nAnd if I jump back over to that server and\n\n551\n00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:52.055\nI get connected on\nthe server I can log in.\n\n552\n00:27:52.055 --> 00:27:54.030\nI'll see the DNS is now running, and so\n\n553\n00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:56.620\nlooking right down here sure\nenough it's got the green light.\n\n554\n00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:00.118\nI'm managing the server, and\nin fact I'm logged in twice now.\n\n555\n00:28:00.118 --> 00:28:02.930\nYou can have five different admins all\nworking on the server at the same time.\n\n556\n00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:06.090\nMaybe Wes is working on DNS\nwhile I'm working on DHCP.\n\n557\n00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:08.030\nThat's fine, now if Wes and\n\n558\n00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:11.410\nI both start working on DHCP we can\nrun into some problems there, right.\n\n559\n00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:14.640\nBut we're able to remotely\nconnect him in as that system and\n\n560\n00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.760\nwork from the comfort of our own offices.\n\n561\n00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.448\nI've worked in many data\ncenters over the years, and\n\n562\n00:28:19.448 --> 00:28:23.270\nwhile you see these amazing pictures\nof these state of the art data centers,\n\n563\n00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.394\nrows of racks and blinking lights,\nit looks really awesome.\n\n564\n00:28:26.394 --> 00:28:29.432\nSpeaking as someone who's\nworked in those data centers,\n\n565\n00:28:29.432 --> 00:28:32.790\nit was a rare day that I\nactually went in the data center.\n\n566\n00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:35.710\nThey look nice from the other side of\nthe glass, but when you get inside,\n\n567\n00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:40.700\nthe fans are loud, it's really cold,\nthe metal floor is hard on your feet.\n\n568\n00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:44.360\nMeanwhile, I can be in my nice warm\noffice where I've got a cushy chair and\n\n569\n00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.720\nI can sit at my desk and\njust remotely manage the servers.\n\n570\n00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:51.150\nThis is what you do and those servers\nmight be all over the world and\n\n571\n00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:53.890\nyou can manage them right from\nthe comfort of your own desk.\n\n572\n00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:58.220\n>> Don, you told us on many occasions\nthat it's BSD under the hood on this, and\n\n573\n00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.514\nlittle bit about BSD.\n\n574\n00:28:59.514 --> 00:29:03.194\nThe fact that you could have a single\nkernel in multiple shell environments.\n\n575\n00:29:03.194 --> 00:29:07.611\nWith remote management is there a limit\nto how many connections can be made?\n\n576\n00:29:07.611 --> 00:29:11.780\nNow obviously you don't want too many\npeople managing a server at the same time\n\n577\n00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:16.640\nbut are there limitations to the remote\nmanagement capabilities at a single time?\n\n578\n00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.020\n>> Not really.\n\n579\n00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.870\nIt's kind of limited by the memory and\nnetwork bandwidth you've got.\n\n580\n00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.850\nThere's port limits based on IPs\nthat you can bump into, but these\n\n581\n00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:29.550\nare things that are in the, at a minimum\nin the tens of thousands of connections.\n\n582\n00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:34.230\nIt's an astronomical number compared to\nwhat you're actually gonna have connected.\n\n583\n00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:35.690\nYou can get people jumping in there.\n\n584\n00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.570\nThe biggest risk is not resources or\neven connectivity,\n\n585\n00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:41.100\nthe biggest risk is just people\nbumping into each other, right?\n\n586\n00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.120\nYou and I working on the same\nfile at the same time-\n\n587\n00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.340\n>> Sure, misconfiguration.\n\n588\n00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:45.650\nYeah.\n>> That's not gonna work out.\n\n589\n00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:46.810\nYep.\n\n590\n00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:50.920\nAll right, I do wanna show you one more\nthing which is what we get when we have\n\n591\n00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.300\na authentication failure.\n\n592\n00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.972\nSo, when I connected to that system,\n\n593\n00:29:55.972 --> 00:29:59.737\nwhat happened was I cached\nits certificate, right?\n\n594\n00:29:59.737 --> 00:30:06.716\nSo the first time you connect,\nlike if I do an ssh to 192.168.0.151,\n\n595\n00:30:06.716 --> 00:30:10.605\nthe first time I connect\nit's gotta prompt for\n\n596\n00:30:10.605 --> 00:30:14.910\na certificate and\nthen I can get logged in, right.\n\n597\n00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:16.570\nI said I trusted the certificate.\n\n598\n00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:17.760\nI'm okay with it.\n\n599\n00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.260\nLet's go.\n\n600\n00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.830\nNow if that certificate were to change,\nthat would fail.\n\n601\n00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:26.420\nAnd the certificate would\nchange under two scenarios.\n\n602\n00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.510\nScenario one,\na hacker is impersonating the system and\n\n603\n00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.670\nI've connected to somebody else's system.\n\n604\n00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:34.780\nScenario two, the certificate expired and\nwe renewed it.\n\n605\n00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.790\nThe certificates don't last forever,\neventually you have to renew them and\n\n606\n00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.420\nthey change but I should be aware of that.\n\n607\n00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.030\nAs the administrator I should know,\n\n608\n00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:44.310\nwe just renewed those certificates I\nexpect to see something different right.\n\n609\n00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:49.740\nNow when you connect, the certificate is\nactually stored in your home directory\n\n610\n00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:53.060\nin a hidden folder called .ssh.\n\n611\n00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:58.740\nSo if I go into that .ssh folder, you'll\nsee this file right here, known_hosts.\n\n612\n00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:04.390\nAnd that file has the keys for\neach system that you've connected to.\n\n613\n00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:07.410\nAnd so you can see all these keys and\nI know what you're thinking.\n\n614\n00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:11.040\nDon why are you showing all of these\nkeys up on the screen during the show,\n\n615\n00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.800\ncouldn't somebody write these down?\n\n616\n00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.430\nFirst off they're really long, so if\nwanna write them down more power to you.\n\n617\n00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.200\nBut secondly these are all public keys.\n\n618\n00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:23.350\nPublic keys allow you to encrypt data and\nnot decrypt data.\n\n619\n00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:26.720\nI can encrypt data and\nsend it to the server with this key.\n\n620\n00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.470\nI can't decrypt the data.\n\n621\n00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:31.480\nSo if somebody gets this public key,\nit's not a big deal.\n\n622\n00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.220\nYou can't read when I'm sending,\nso I'm not worried about that.\n\n623\n00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.710\nI'm using it really just for\nidentity management of this other server.\n\n624\n00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.910\nI'm not even worried about encryption\nhere cuz it's a local system.\n\n625\n00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:42.716\nBut these public keys are perfectly safe.\n\n626\n00:31:42.716 --> 00:31:45.201\nYou can copy them between machines,\nit's just whether you trust it.\n\n627\n00:31:45.201 --> 00:31:50.913\nSo, here is the 192.168.0.151, and\nhere's the public key that I've cached.\n\n628\n00:31:50.913 --> 00:31:54.315\nNow what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna come in here and\n\n629\n00:31:54.315 --> 00:31:58.670\nI'm gonna change one letter,\njust a single letter.\n\n630\n00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:00.300\nThere's a z right here,\n\n631\n00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:04.250\nI'm gonna change that from\na lowercase z to a capital Z right.\n\n632\n00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:07.280\nSo that's it, I'm just changing one\nlittle character and that's it.\n\n633\n00:32:08.288 --> 00:32:14.620\nNow, I'm gonna SSH back into that system,\nand when I do, it says the authenticity\n\n634\n00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:19.920\nof the host could not be established,\nECDSA key fingerprint is blah blah blah.\n\n635\n00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.990\nIt's telling me the key doesn't match.\n\n636\n00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:25.900\nAnd if I say yeah, go ahead and connect,\nit's going to let me connect, but\n\n637\n00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.920\nI got a warning telling me,\nhey, that didn't match.\n\n638\n00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.140\nThere's something wrong,\n\n639\n00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:34.700\nwe can't verify that this is authentic and\nit's given me an error.\n\n640\n00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.890\n>> Would you get that same error, Don,\nlet's say in the scenario that you've\n\n641\n00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:41.450\ngiven us, you're an administrator and you\ndo renew the key, would you get that same\n\n642\n00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.900\nerror the first time you connected\nwith a renewed key as well?\n\n643\n00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:44.860\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n644\n00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:49.740\nYep, absolutely and so, what I generally\ndo is if I change like if I renew\n\n645\n00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.940\nthat key,\none of the first things I do is come and\n\n646\n00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.833\ndelete the old key from\nmy known host file.\n\n647\n00:32:55.833 --> 00:32:58.433\nAnd so you can just come and\ndelete that one right out of there and\n\n648\n00:32:58.433 --> 00:33:00.609\nthat way the next time you\nconnect to this one again.\n\n649\n00:33:00.609 --> 00:33:04.844\nAnd so you see actually I have two entries\nnow because there's a damaged key and\n\n650\n00:33:04.844 --> 00:33:07.102\nthe new key that it\njust got to replace it.\n\n651\n00:33:07.102 --> 00:33:12.088\nSo that process is kind of a ongoing thing\nthat you'll have to worry about with\n\n652\n00:33:12.088 --> 00:33:13.550\ncertificates.\n\n653\n00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.740\n>> Very good.\nA lot of good information on how we can\n\n654\n00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:19.220\nconnect to our servers when we're not\nin the physical location of the server,\n\n655\n00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.940\ngreat management capabilities as well.\n\n656\n00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:21.730\nThank you for that Don.\n\n657\n00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:25.690\nGot any parting words as I see that\nwe're coming to the end of this episode?\n\n658\n00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:28.390\n>> Just remember that remote\nmanagement is super convenient\n\n659\n00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:29.710\nunless your network fails.\n\n660\n00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:31.230\nSo always have a backup plan.\n\n661\n00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:33.253\nSome kind of out of band management,\nsomething,\n\n662\n00:33:33.253 --> 00:33:34.803\nsome other way to access the systems.\n\n663\n00:33:34.803 --> 00:33:38.361\nIf it's a remote, like a truly remote\nsystem thousands of miles away,\n\n664\n00:33:38.361 --> 00:33:41.978\nyou may need to have some kind of\nphysical point of contact over that other\n\n665\n00:33:41.978 --> 00:33:45.530\nlocation so you can still get into\na system even if the network fails.\n\n666\n00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.160\n>> All right, thank you for that, Don.\n\n667\n00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.610\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off here.\n\n668\n00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:51.490\nFor ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n669\n00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:52.150\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n670\n00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:53.135\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n671\n00:33:53.135 --> 00:34:02.010\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.358\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\n\n4\n00:00:16.358 --> 00:00:20.634\nin today's episode we're gonna be moving\nthrough our OS 10 server essentials.\n\n5\n00:00:20.634 --> 00:00:23.518\nWe have none other then Mr.\nDon Pezet in the house to help us out.\n\n6\n00:00:23.518 --> 00:00:24.986\nDon how are you doing, and welcome, sir.\n\n7\n00:00:24.986 --> 00:00:26.187\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n8\n00:00:26.187 --> 00:00:29.304\nReady to dive right back into\nthe world of OS 10 server essentials,\n\n9\n00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:32.903\nand in this episode we're gonna pick up\non a topic that I mentioned repeatedly in\n\n10\n00:00:32.903 --> 00:00:36.422\nthe last episode, I keep saying we'll\nget to it in the certificate episode.\n\n11\n00:00:36.422 --> 00:00:40.388\nThis is the certificate episode so we're\ngonna take a look at how the OS 10 server\n\n12\n00:00:40.388 --> 00:00:44.126\napp can use certificates to secure\nyour connections, how they're stored,\n\n13\n00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:46.965\nand how we can kind of work with\nthem inside of the systems.\n\n14\n00:00:46.965 --> 00:00:48.393\nSo we've got a lot to look at here.\n\n15\n00:00:48.393 --> 00:00:50.099\nI will be honest with you guys.\n\n16\n00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:53.213\nIn real life land, this is typically\nsomething people don't worry about.\n\n17\n00:00:53.213 --> 00:00:56.838\nThat when you install the server app,\nit creates a self signed certificate,\n\n18\n00:00:56.838 --> 00:00:58.475\nthat it just generates on its own.\n\n19\n00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.512\nAnd that's it, and it works.\n\n20\n00:01:00.512 --> 00:01:02.418\nAnd a lot of people just trust that and\nrun with it.\n\n21\n00:01:02.418 --> 00:01:05.471\nBut it is not the most secure\nsolution in the world.\n\n22\n00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:08.356\nAnd so there's a lot more\nthat you should be doing.\n\n23\n00:01:08.356 --> 00:01:09.663\nBut a lot of people just don't, so\n\n24\n00:01:09.663 --> 00:01:12.297\nwe're gonna take a look at some of\nthe stuff that you should be doing.\n\n25\n00:01:12.297 --> 00:01:16.348\n>> Now, when it comes to certificates,\nwe know that they're important, and if you\n\n26\n00:01:16.348 --> 00:01:20.575\ndon't know, as far as I understand this,\nDon, this is really how we do things like,\n\n27\n00:01:20.575 --> 00:01:24.393\nfor instance, securing e-commerce\nworldwide, and there is a hierarchy to\n\n28\n00:01:24.393 --> 00:01:28.312\nthis, and you're gonna explain a little\nbit about that in today's episode.\n\n29\n00:01:28.312 --> 00:01:30.296\n>> Yeah, that's a really good point Wes,\nis that I don't,\n\n30\n00:01:30.296 --> 00:01:32.970\nsometimes I make the assumption that\neverybody already knows this stuff, but\n\n31\n00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.015\nI guess you wouldn't watch\nthe show if you already knew it.\n\n32\n00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:38.578\nSo let's talk a little bit about how those\ncertificates work in the first place.\n\n33\n00:01:38.578 --> 00:01:40.355\nAnd then we can see how\nthe server leverages them.\n\n34\n00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:43.876\nAnd I whipped up some diagrams\nto kind of show this process and\n\n35\n00:01:43.876 --> 00:01:47.193\nthen help us understand that,\nbasically, when you're\n\n36\n00:01:47.193 --> 00:01:51.916\ncommunicating with OS 10 server,\nit's a client server connection, right?\n\n37\n00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:56.366\nAnd we've got the server piece that is\nobviously pretty important to the whole\n\n38\n00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:59.333\nthing, but\nthe client piece is just as important and\n\n39\n00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:02.244\nthe way they work together\nis kind of a neat system.\n\n40\n00:02:02.244 --> 00:02:05.851\nSo on my client,\nif I'm running the server app, and\n\n41\n00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:11.519\nconnecting to the actual server over here,\nor if I'm just running a web browser.\n\n42\n00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.687\nLet's just say I'm browsing the web,\nI fire up Safari and\n\n43\n00:02:14.687 --> 00:02:19.225\nI connect to a website somewhere, and\nthat website says hey, let's do security.\n\n44\n00:02:19.225 --> 00:02:21.580\nLet's do HTTPS, right?\n\n45\n00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.499\nWell, it's gonna kick in encryption,\nand the encryption that you see\n\n46\n00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.905\nis normally what's called TLS or\ntransport layer security.\n\n47\n00:02:28.905 --> 00:02:29.947\nMost people call it SSL.\n\n48\n00:02:29.947 --> 00:02:34.437\nThey say secure socket layer, but\nthe reality is nobody uses SSL anymore.\n\n49\n00:02:34.437 --> 00:02:37.508\nThere was SSL version one,\nversion two, and version three,\n\n50\n00:02:37.508 --> 00:02:39.600\nall three of which have been broken.\n\n51\n00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.274\nSo all three of which can be decrypted and\nare no longer considered safe.\n\n52\n00:02:43.274 --> 00:02:48.095\nIt was replaced by TLS 1.0,\nand then 1.1, and now 1.2.\n\n53\n00:02:48.095 --> 00:02:51.528\nWell, TLS 1.0 has been shown as weak.\n\n54\n00:02:51.528 --> 00:02:54.280\nNot necessarily broken, but weak.\n\n55\n00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.770\nSo really when you go to a website and the\nencryption kicks in, it's TLS 1.1 or 1.2.\n\n56\n00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.710\nWhen you run the server app,\nor when you run SSH.\n\n57\n00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.143\nWhen you run all these different protocols\nto build encrypted sessions on your Mac,\n\n58\n00:03:07.143 --> 00:03:08.276\nthey're using TLS.\n\n59\n00:03:08.276 --> 00:03:09.111\nThey're using that same thing.\n\n60\n00:03:09.111 --> 00:03:12.404\nYou know, Secure Socket Layer was\nreally designed just for web browsing,\n\n61\n00:03:12.404 --> 00:03:13.824\nit was designed just for HTTPS.\n\n62\n00:03:13.824 --> 00:03:17.800\nBut TLS, Transport Layer Security,\nwas designed to encrypt everything.\n\n63\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.340\nAnd so it can do that,\nit does a really good job.\n\n64\n00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.070\nIt works the same way as SSL,\nit just uses stronger encryption,\n\n65\n00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.650\nit's a little more flexible.\n\n66\n00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.320\nAnd the way the system works is\nwith what's called a key pair.\n\n67\n00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.330\nA key pair is basically two keys,\na private key and a public key.\n\n68\n00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.955\nAnd the private key is\nthe most important one.\n\n69\n00:03:35.955 --> 00:03:42.321\nThe private key, what it is, is basically\na randomly generated set of letters and\n\n70\n00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:48.200\nnumbers, not completely random,\nthere's a lot that goes into it.\n\n71\n00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.183\nThat creates an identity for\nyou, all right.\n\n72\n00:03:51.183 --> 00:03:55.007\nAnd when you encrypt data,\nyou can encrypt it and\n\n73\n00:03:55.007 --> 00:03:58.560\nusing this private key,\nyou can decrypt it.\n\n74\n00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.883\nRight, at it's most simple, think of the\ndecoder rings that you got as a kid where\n\n75\n00:04:03.883 --> 00:04:08.744\nmaybe letters are matched up to numbers,\nso letter A is matched up to one and\n\n76\n00:04:08.744 --> 00:04:13.404\nletter B is matched up to two and\nletter C is matched up to three and so on.\n\n77\n00:04:13.404 --> 00:04:18.738\nAnd so if somebody wanted to write,\nwell let's do just a simple example.\n\n78\n00:04:18.738 --> 00:04:22.542\nSo it is a real simple cipher\nis what I'm talking about here.\n\n79\n00:04:22.542 --> 00:04:29.633\nAnd the way they work is you\ncome up with just a simple key.\n\n80\n00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:36.806\nAnd the key might be A=1,\nB=2, C=3, D=4 and so on.\n\n81\n00:04:36.806 --> 00:04:42.840\nRight, so, that just continues on all the\nway to I guess it would be Z=26, right.\n\n82\n00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.439\nAnd then when somebody writes something,\n\n83\n00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:48.407\ninstead of writing DAD\nthey might write 414.\n\n84\n00:04:48.407 --> 00:04:52.917\nSo if I get a document and\nI see 414 what does that mean to me?\n\n85\n00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:57.506\nNothing, 414, but\nif I have the key I can see 4 is D,\n\n86\n00:04:57.506 --> 00:05:00.557\n1 is A, 4 is D, that's DAD right?\n\n87\n00:05:00.557 --> 00:05:03.056\nThis is the key that deciphers that.\n\n88\n00:05:03.056 --> 00:05:05.331\nSo a private key works that same way.\n\n89\n00:05:05.331 --> 00:05:08.826\nIf I have the private key,\nI can decode the message.\n\n90\n00:05:08.826 --> 00:05:12.626\nBut it's not a one to one mapping,\nit's not A is 1 and B is 2.\n\n91\n00:05:12.626 --> 00:05:16.282\nIt's actually one piece of\na very complex formula.\n\n92\n00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:20.910\nAnd I can take the data and run it\nthrough the formula with that key, and\n\n93\n00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.186\nthe output will be the unencoded or\n\n94\n00:05:23.186 --> 00:05:27.455\nthe plain text data that was\nsent over the network, right?\n\n95\n00:05:27.455 --> 00:05:29.026\nSo the key is really important.\n\n96\n00:05:29.026 --> 00:05:33.102\nThis private key, if somebody were\nto get a hold of this private key,\n\n97\n00:05:33.102 --> 00:05:36.568\nthey could decrypt any secure\ncommunication that I sent.\n\n98\n00:05:36.568 --> 00:05:37.889\nIt's the keys to the kingdom.\n\n99\n00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.900\nSo this is very very sensitive.\n\n100\n00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.560\nI don't want somebody\nto get my private key.\n\n101\n00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.730\nWell, if a client is gonna\nconnect to me to encrypt data and\n\n102\n00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.160\nsend it, they need a key don't they?\n\n103\n00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.684\nAnd if I'm using this private key,\nhow can I get them to use that, right?\n\n104\n00:05:55.684 --> 00:05:59.174\nWell, if I know I'm gonna be doing this,\nI can take the private key and\n\n105\n00:05:59.174 --> 00:06:02.899\nburn it to a disk, or put it on a thumb\ndrive and take it over to that person and\n\n106\n00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:06.093\nput it in their hands and\nhave them load it on their computer, and\n\n107\n00:06:06.093 --> 00:06:07.903\nnow they've got that private key.\n\n108\n00:06:07.903 --> 00:06:11.935\nNow we both have the same private key,\nwe can encrypt and decrypt and talk and\n\n109\n00:06:11.935 --> 00:06:12.954\nit's all secure.\n\n110\n00:06:12.954 --> 00:06:14.585\nBut that key exchange was kind of a pain.\n\n111\n00:06:14.585 --> 00:06:18.506\nWhat about, well, think about Apple.\n\n112\n00:06:18.506 --> 00:06:20.903\nIf you go to Apple's website,\nyou can go to the Apple store.\n\n113\n00:06:20.903 --> 00:06:24.561\nAnd in the Apple website store,\nyou can buy Macs, and iPads, and so on.\n\n114\n00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:27.040\nAnd because you can spend a ton of money,\nobviously it's secure.\n\n115\n00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.030\nSo they use SSL.\n\n116\n00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.560\nWell, when I go to that site, right,\nso if I fire up old Safari, and\n\n117\n00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.560\nI'm gonna go to apple.com.\n\n118\n00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.501\nAnd when I go to Apple's website and\nhey, there's a new iPad Pro, great,\n\n119\n00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:43.494\nand I wanna buy it, so\nI'm gonna go to buy it.\n\n120\n00:06:43.494 --> 00:06:48.414\nAnd as soon as I do that, I was on\nApple's website and now I'm going to buy\n\n121\n00:06:48.414 --> 00:06:53.499\nthis new iPad and, sorry guys, I'm just\nclicking real fast here to try and\n\n122\n00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:59.091\nbuy stuff, and as I browse through, well,\nnone of this has been secure, right?\n\n123\n00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:02.773\nIf I look up here at my address bar,\nnone of this is secure.\n\n124\n00:07:02.773 --> 00:07:05.089\nThis is all just regular me browsing, and\n\n125\n00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:08.665\nthat's because I haven't really\nprovided any information yet\n\n126\n00:07:08.665 --> 00:07:13.370\nof any kind of sensitive nature,\nI've just been picking an iPad, right?\n\n127\n00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.080\nBut when I finally get it specced out and\ngo to buy it, right, I'll pass on all\n\n128\n00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.770\nthe accessories, add that to my shopping\ncart, and now I'm ready to check out.\n\n129\n00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.266\nAs soon as I go to check out,\ndid you see how Apple's name turned green?\n\n130\n00:07:27.266 --> 00:07:31.941\nOkay, it turned green, and\nwhat it's doing, my goodness,\n\n131\n00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:34.379\ncome on here, [LAUGH] there we go.\n\n132\n00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:37.963\nWhat it's doing, besides annoying the heck\nout of me with security prompts there,\n\n133\n00:07:37.963 --> 00:07:39.843\nis it's switching to a secure connection.\n\n134\n00:07:39.843 --> 00:07:45.224\nAnd you can see it right here,\nhttps://secure2.store.apple.com.\n\n135\n00:07:45.224 --> 00:07:49.719\nIf flipped me from an unprotected session,\ncuz nothing was sensitive,\n\n136\n00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:54.079\nto encrypted connection where I can\nnow send my credit card data safe.\n\n137\n00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:57.686\nNow, I didn't have to\nmeet with an Apple rep.\n\n138\n00:07:57.686 --> 00:08:02.265\nThey didn't send a thumb drive or a DVD\nout to me with their private key on it for\n\n139\n00:08:02.265 --> 00:08:02.980\nme to load.\n\n140\n00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.710\nThey wouldn't want to do that anyway.\n\n141\n00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.310\nBecause if I had their private key,\n\n142\n00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.330\nI could decode anyone else's\ncommunications to Apple.\n\n143\n00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.751\nSo that's not how it works.\n\n144\n00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:11.522\nHow does it work?\n\n145\n00:08:11.522 --> 00:08:13.121\nIf it's automatic like this, and\n\n146\n00:08:13.121 --> 00:08:17.120\nwe don't want to send that private key\nover the network, how does it work?\n\n147\n00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.830\nWell, it works with a key pair,\ntwo keys, all right.\n\n148\n00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.860\nThe first key is the private key and\nit's important.\n\n149\n00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.850\nIt's the one that can encrypt and\ndecrypt, it can do both, right?\n\n150\n00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:32.590\nBut based on the private key we can\ngenerate one or more public keys.\n\n151\n00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.770\nIt can make a public key and\ngive that to me.\n\n152\n00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.330\nAt once I have that public key,\nI can use the public key to encrypt data.\n\n153\n00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.950\nAnd once I encrypt the data I\ncan send it over the network and\n\n154\n00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.360\nthe server can decrypt\nit with the private key.\n\n155\n00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.580\nMy public key can not decrypt data.\n\n156\n00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.220\nIt can only encrypt.\n\n157\n00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.440\nSo instead of sending\nthe private key back and\n\n158\n00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:01.490\nforth what we do it we\nsend just the public key.\n\n159\n00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.280\nAnd we don't even send it back and forth.\n\n160\n00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.377\nIt's a one-way thing.\n\n161\n00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.590\nIt's one-way trip.\n\n162\n00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.300\nThat private key crosses\nover to my client.\n\n163\n00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.200\nI get a copy of it.\n\n164\n00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.700\nAnd once I've got that,\nnow I can encrypt data and send it back.\n\n165\n00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.990\nThe problem there is,\nI'm now encrypting things.\n\n166\n00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.020\nLike I encrypt my credit card and\nsend it up there, right:?\n\n167\n00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.640\nThe server gets it and decrypts it.\n\n168\n00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.610\nBut what do I see on the screen?\n\n169\n00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.320\nIt shows the last four\ndigits of my credit card.\n\n170\n00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.940\nAnd my address says verify your order.\n\n171\n00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.560\nAll of my information's\nright there coming back.\n\n172\n00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.820\nAnd the server can't encrypt\nit to send it me, can it?\n\n173\n00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.880\nBecause if it does,\nI don't have a way to decrypt it so\n\n174\n00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.190\nI wouldn't be able to read it.\n\n175\n00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:40.630\nSo, what we end up having to do\nis set up asymmetric encryption.\n\n176\n00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:46.690\nWith asymmetric encryption what happens is\nthe server has a private key, it generates\n\n177\n00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:51.170\na public key based off of that private\nkey, and sends it over to me right?\n\n178\n00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.310\nSo this shouldn't be a two way arrow,\nthis should be like a one way arrow.\n\n179\n00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.780\nLet me just make that one way.\n\n180\n00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:55.600\nThere we go.\n\n181\n00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.950\nAll right, so\nthe server sends me a public key.\n\n182\n00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:03.780\nOnce I have the public key,\nI can create a private key just for\n\n183\n00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:08.640\nmy session, unique to me, it doesn't match\nup with anyone else in the world, just me.\n\n184\n00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.860\nI create a private key,\nI can encrypt it and\n\n185\n00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.120\nsend it over this secure\nconnection to the server.\n\n186\n00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.900\nThe server can decrypt it and\nnow they've got my private key.\n\n187\n00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.500\nWith that private key, we can now\nencrypt and decrypt data back and forth,\n\n188\n00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.560\nand I can talk to Apple, and\nI can do it securely, all right?\n\n189\n00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.330\nSo that's kind of the key principle,\nwhat's going on in the background.\n\n190\n00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.660\n>> All right, now I'm going to\nput the black hat on here, and\n\n191\n00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.670\nI'm going sit in-between\nthat key exchange,\n\n192\n00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:38.210\nand Don you said that that private\nkey is good for this session.\n\n193\n00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.910\nSo let's say miraculously\nI happen to grab that key.\n\n194\n00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.280\nAnd you close that web browser down,\nwhat does the key do for me now?\n\n195\n00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.010\n>> All right.\n\n196\n00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.240\nWell, the miraculous part is important,\nright?\n\n197\n00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.730\nBecause you're not going\nto be able to get that key.\n\n198\n00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.530\n>> Sure.\n>> If somebody's in between,\n\n199\n00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:51.540\nthey're on the internet, right?\n\n200\n00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.470\nSo they're right here in this cloud,\nand they intercept the communication.\n\n201\n00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:59.900\nThe only unencrypted communication that\nhappened was this one right here, okay?\n\n202\n00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.950\nWhen the server sent me the public key.\n\n203\n00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.410\nSo a hacker could\nintercept that public key.\n\n204\n00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.190\nOnce they had it,\nthey could encrypt data and\n\n205\n00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.720\ninject it in the session but\nthey couldn't decrypt data.\n\n206\n00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.360\nAnd even if they encrypt data and\n\n207\n00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.090\ninject it, it doesn't match up with our\nsession so it just gets thrown out.\n\n208\n00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:17.080\nSo it's really ineffective.\n\n209\n00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.090\nIt doesn't do anything.\n\n210\n00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.720\nThe public key is kind of useless to them.\n\n211\n00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.350\nThey want the private key.\n\n212\n00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:25.300\nWell, this private key never\ncrossed the network, did it?\n\n213\n00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.060\nThe other private key did\ncross the network, but\n\n214\n00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.550\nit was encrypted with this public key, it\nwas encrypted, and sent over the network.\n\n215\n00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.620\nSo, if they intercept that data,\nit's encrypted.\n\n216\n00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.490\nThey would need the original private key\nto break it, and they never got that, and\n\n217\n00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.780\nit never crossed the network.\n\n218\n00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.070\nThat makes for a safe communication.\n\n219\n00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.530\nIt's kind of a complex system, and\n\n220\n00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:48.090\nit's pretty ingenious, the way that it\nworks, but we use this every single day.\n\n221\n00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.320\nEven if you don't know\na single thing about security,\n\n222\n00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.380\nif you bought something online, the odds\nare you went through this process.\n\n223\n00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.880\nYour system does it all the time.\n\n224\n00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.610\nThe server app does too.\n\n225\n00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.010\nWhen you have an OS 10 server,\n\n226\n00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.860\nduring the install it creates\na self-signed certificate.\n\n227\n00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.460\nIt creates a private key.\n\n228\n00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.230\nAnd based on that private key,\nit creates a public key that it can\n\n229\n00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.720\nsend to clients that want to connect,\nand it does it all behind the scenes.\n\n230\n00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.300\nSo whenever you communicate with the\nserver app, you can do it securely, right?\n\n231\n00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:21.290\nIf you want to see that, well let\nme find a server here, here we go.\n\n232\n00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:25.260\nSo here's my server, and\nif I get into my server app and\n\n233\n00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:29.900\nconnect, right up here at the top,\nyou've got your OSX server,\n\n234\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:35.470\nyou've got your default summary page\nthen right here you've got certificates.\n\n235\n00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:40.900\nYou'll see where I've got OSX\nserver01.local, self-signed.\n\n236\n00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.920\nI didn't make that certificate,\nthe server app did.\n\n237\n00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.780\nWhen it launched the first time and it set\nitself up, it created that certificate\n\n238\n00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:52.590\nthat parked it right there so that it\ncould use it for securing communications.\n\n239\n00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.110\nAnd that is a key pair a public and\na private key.\n\n240\n00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:00.450\nAll right, now I talk about these\nkeys what does a key look like.\n\n241\n00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:03.960\nWell I actually have some of\nour old keys laying around.\n\n242\n00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.690\nI don't wanna show our current\nkeys because that would be bad.\n\n243\n00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.800\nBut this is an actual key that we used\nto use in a sandbox environment that's\n\n244\n00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.320\ngone now so I don't mind showing it.\n\n245\n00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.110\nBut your key's actually made\nup of three different pieces.\n\n246\n00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.100\nThere's what's called the original key.\n\n247\n00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.940\nThe original key, this is your private\nkey, this is the keys to the kingdom.\n\n248\n00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.068\nThis is the one that if it gets out,\nthat will be bad.\n\n249\n00:13:25.068 --> 00:13:29.454\nYou don't want people to have that cuz\nthey can decrypt anything going to that\n\n250\n00:13:29.454 --> 00:13:32.367\nsite all right that's\nsomething you don't want.\n\n251\n00:13:32.367 --> 00:13:34.796\nThen you need to generate a public key,\nand\n\n252\n00:13:34.796 --> 00:13:39.199\nthe public key is called the certificate\nso you see I've got .key and .crt.\n\n253\n00:13:39.199 --> 00:13:41.736\nThis is the private this\nis the public right.\n\n254\n00:13:41.736 --> 00:13:43.480\nThese are the two keys.\n\n255\n00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.380\nSee how the operating system gives\na nice little icon to the Public key?\n\n256\n00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.770\nAnd it doesn't to the private key?\n\n257\n00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:51.290\nAnd that's because private keys shouldn't\nnormally be handled by regular people.\n\n258\n00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:52.990\nSo Apple doesn't even\nput an icon on that one.\n\n259\n00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:54.650\nI'm not supposed to be\nable to handle that.\n\n260\n00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:57.770\nThe other file that\nI've got here is a csr.\n\n261\n00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:01.250\nA csr is a Certificate Signing Request.\n\n262\n00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.410\nNow what's that all about?\n\n263\n00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:08.800\nWell, when you look at a key, if you made\nit yourself, it's called self-signed.\n\n264\n00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.200\nYou made it up.\n\n265\n00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.650\nIf you made it up, who in the world\nis going to trust that certificate?\n\n266\n00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:15.450\nNobody.\n\n267\n00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.550\nWell, nobody by default.\n\n268\n00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:21.940\nWe can get people to trust it, but\nby default nobody is going to trust it.\n\n269\n00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.910\nEvery Mac, every Windows machine,\n\n270\n00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:28.850\nevery Linux machine,\nhas a list of people they trust built in.\n\n271\n00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.960\nYou can see it in web browsers.\n\n272\n00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.540\nYou can see it in several\ndifferent places.\n\n273\n00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.920\nYou have these built in\ncertificates that you trust.\n\n274\n00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.550\nThis certificate right\nhere is not one of them.\n\n275\n00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:38.930\nYou just made it up.\n\n276\n00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.050\nSo these are untrusted.\n\n277\n00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:45.030\nIf you want to have a Trusted Certificate,\nyou either need to get people to trust\n\n278\n00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.340\nyou, which means they're going\nto take action on their part, or\n\n279\n00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.140\nyou have to get somebody else,\n\n280\n00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:54.550\nsomebody who's already trusted to sign\nyour certificate to say it's okay.\n\n281\n00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:58.350\nSo you do that by creating a self\nI am certificate-signing request.\n\n282\n00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.630\nAnd then you can go to some of\nthe big names that are out there like\n\n283\n00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:05.000\nthere's Verisign,\nDigicert, Thought, right?\n\n284\n00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.780\nThese are big companies out there,\n\n285\n00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.660\nthat all the major web browsers\ntrust- Safari trusts them,\n\n286\n00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:14.340\nInternet Explorer trusts them, Chrome\ntrusts them, Firefox, they all trust them.\n\n287\n00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:18.880\nSo if I can get Digicert\nto sign my certificate,\n\n288\n00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.210\nthat's DigiCert vouching for me.\n\n289\n00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:23.920\nSo if a browser trusts DigiCert, and\n\n290\n00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.870\nDigiCert trusts me,\nthat browser now trusts me.\n\n291\n00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.110\nSo that's how it works.\n\n292\n00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.490\nWe have to get a public\nauthority to sign that.\n\n293\n00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:33.990\nAnd so that's called a public certificate\nversus a self-signed certificate.\n\n294\n00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:36.780\nThe thing about getting\nsomebody else to trust you,\n\n295\n00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.035\nis you typically have to pay them.\n\n296\n00:15:38.035 --> 00:15:41.380\nSelf-signed certificates are free,\nyou can just make them on your own.\n\n297\n00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.170\nBut if wanna get a publicly trusted cert,\nam gonna have to pay for it.\n\n298\n00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.480\nSo I gotta go to one of those vendors.\n\n299\n00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.943\nAnd some of them, I like DigiCert.\n\n300\n00:15:46.943 --> 00:15:50.263\nThose guys are really easy to work\nwith and are not that expensive,\n\n301\n00:15:50.263 --> 00:15:54.370\nmaybe a few 100 bucks a year and now\nyou've got a publicly traded certificate.\n\n302\n00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:58.193\n>> And Don, could you explain to us just\na little bit, why would I trust VeriSign.\n\n303\n00:15:58.193 --> 00:16:01.952\nWhy would I trust something like\nthese certificate authorities, or\n\n304\n00:16:01.952 --> 00:16:03.247\nwhy would our devices,\n\n305\n00:16:03.247 --> 00:16:07.670\nwhat is it that builds that trust, that\nif I think of it like a driver's licence?\n\n306\n00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.997\nI go into a bank and\nI want my money, right so\n\n307\n00:16:09.997 --> 00:16:13.056\nI have to present my driver's\nlicense to prove who I am.\n\n308\n00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:16.035\nAnd I mean you can see if I say well\nI'm just gonna take this piece of paper\n\n309\n00:16:16.035 --> 00:16:17.429\nI'm gonna scratch out my own ID and\n\n310\n00:16:17.429 --> 00:16:20.960\nI'm gonna present it to them of\ncourse they're not gonna trust it.\n\n311\n00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.100\nWhy is it that they would trust\nthe certificate like they would trust my\n\n312\n00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:23.940\nlicense?\n\n313\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.656\n>> All right so what's happened is the big\nproviders Verisign, DigiCert those guys\n\n314\n00:16:28.656 --> 00:16:32.912\nthe reason they charge money is because\nin order for them to be so trusted.\n\n315\n00:16:32.912 --> 00:16:37.757\nThey had to implement a ton of security\nprotocols, and they had to get with\n\n316\n00:16:37.757 --> 00:16:42.620\nApple and Microsoft and Firefox and\nprove how secure their systems were.\n\n317\n00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.360\nAs they went through that process they\njumped through those hoops to prove\n\n318\n00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.810\nthemselves to the vendors.\n\n319\n00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.430\nAnd now the vendors trust them.\n\n320\n00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.370\nYou could do it too.\n\n321\n00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.670\nIf you wanted to jump\nthrough all the hoops and\n\n322\n00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.140\nmeet with Microsoft and\nmeet with Apple and meet with those guys\n\n323\n00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.620\nyou can get yourself listed in their\nofficial default trusted search.\n\n324\n00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.500\nBut it takes a lot of money and\na lot of time.\n\n325\n00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.990\nThese guys have already done it.\n\n326\n00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.690\nSo that's why they're trusted.\n\n327\n00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:06.230\nAn then we as the end user,\nwe trust Apple, we trust Microsoft,\n\n328\n00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.420\ncuz they wrote our operating system.\n\n329\n00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.820\nIf they're gonna screw\nwith us we can't stop it.\n\n330\n00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.730\nSo you have no choice but to trust them.\n\n331\n00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:15.860\nAnd so if they trust somebody else\nthen it's like a transitive trust.\n\n332\n00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.740\nI trust them.\n\n333\n00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.710\nThey trust the provider.\n\n334\n00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:20.540\nThat way we trust the provider, right?\n\n335\n00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.410\nIf A equals B and\nB equals C then A equals C.\n\n336\n00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:28.850\nThat's some kind of Pythagorean theorem or\nsome crazy things like that.\n\n337\n00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.520\nBut that's kind of the way\nthat process works, right?\n\n338\n00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.040\nAnd it works through this\nkind of crazy system.\n\n339\n00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.600\nLet me show you here, all the different\npieces of the puzzle, okay.\n\n340\n00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.630\nThese are the pieces\nthat kinda go together.\n\n341\n00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:44.110\nWhat you have is a certificate\nof authority, a CA.\n\n342\n00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:48.400\nThat CA is the person who's\nallowed to sign certificates.\n\n343\n00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.580\nThis is the big dog.\n\n344\n00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:50.220\nRight?\n\n345\n00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.630\nVerisign has a CA, and DigiCert has a CA.\n\n346\n00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.100\nYou can make your own CA.\n\n347\n00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.020\nIn fact, the server app is already\ndesigned to be a CA right out of the box.\n\n348\n00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.710\nIf you install open directory,\nyou become a CA, and\n\n349\n00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:08.280\nany client that binds to your open\ndirectory will automatically trust you.\n\n350\n00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.040\nSo you become a trusted CA for\nanybody bound to your open directory.\n\n351\n00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:11.885\nThat happens automatic.\n\n352\n00:18:11.885 --> 00:18:13.740\nWe'll see that in the open\ndirectory episodes.\n\n353\n00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.680\nIt's just a part of the process.\n\n354\n00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.550\nAll right.\n\n355\n00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.650\nBut these guys are big.\n\n356\n00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:20.366\nAnd they're very secure.\n\n357\n00:18:20.366 --> 00:18:22.210\nAnd notice how I've got this\nlike red lines here and\n\n358\n00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:24.400\nthe red line never touch the CA?\n\n359\n00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.600\nThat's because the CA is\nalmost always air gap.\n\n360\n00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.000\nAll right.\n\n361\n00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.580\nAn air gap means they're not\nplugged into the network.\n\n362\n00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:34.123\nA hacker can't get into those systems\nbecause they're not plugged in.\n\n363\n00:18:34.123 --> 00:18:39.800\nAnd what happens is the subordinate CAs\nneed to register with the primary CA.\n\n364\n00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.092\nAnd the primary is the heart,\n\n365\n00:18:41.092 --> 00:18:44.290\nthe subordinates are like secondary\nCAs that the world gets to see.\n\n366\n00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:49.010\nThe subordinate CAs need to get signed and\nso they generate a request.\n\n367\n00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.640\nThey put it onto a thumb drive,\nthey physically carry it to the CA, and\n\n368\n00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.260\nthey get it signed.\n\n369\n00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.920\nAnd they put the sign cert\nback onto the thumb drive, and\n\n370\n00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.220\nwalk it back over to the CA.\n\n371\n00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.820\nFor a hacker to break into a CA,\n\n372\n00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.070\nthey would have to physically\naccess that building, right?\n\n373\n00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:07.280\nAnd these places have armed guards,\nmost of them are underground.\n\n374\n00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.993\nI mean, this is like the highest level\nof security around these things,\n\n375\n00:19:09.993 --> 00:19:11.292\ncuz their entire business model.\n\n376\n00:19:11.292 --> 00:19:14.680\nAnd really, security across the entire\nInternet is built around this, right?\n\n377\n00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:19.120\nSo really kind of a key component there,\nand it's all separate.\n\n378\n00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.930\nIt would very expensive for\nyou to implement that same solution.\n\n379\n00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:23.910\n>> All right now I'm going to\nput the black hat back on,\n\n380\n00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:25.580\nI've got a lot of color\nhats if you can't tell.\n\n381\n00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:26.900\nRight now we're wearing the black hat.\n\n382\n00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.940\nWhat would happen Don, let's say\ntheoretically, if that top dog in that\n\n383\n00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:35.520\nhierarchy did get compromised, what would\nhappen to everything below that hierarchy?\n\n384\n00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.500\n>> It would have to be invalidated.\n\n385\n00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.730\nIt'd have to be revoked.\n\n386\n00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.030\nYou couldn't trust those\ncertificates anymore.\n\n387\n00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:43.730\nWhoever broke into the root CA would\nthen have the ability to decrypt pretty\n\n388\n00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:44.400\nmuch everything.\n\n389\n00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.180\nThey'd have access to those keys and\nmore importantly\n\n390\n00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:52.770\nthey could issue new keys and say that\nthey were Google or Microsoft or Apple.\n\n391\n00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:55.740\nThey could start issuing keys and\nimpersonating other people.\n\n392\n00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.020\nAnd we wouldn't know it.\n\n393\n00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.020\nYou'd go to a website that would\nshow that it was secure and\n\n394\n00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.670\nit would show that it was Google,\neven though it wasn't issued by them.\n\n395\n00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:02.650\nIt'd be really bad.\n\n396\n00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:03.340\nThat happened.\n\n397\n00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.950\nIt was DigiNotar?\n\n398\n00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:05.650\n>> DigiNotar, yes.\n\n399\n00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:06.740\n>> There we go.\n\n400\n00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.870\nThey were based out of Netherlands?\n\n401\n00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:09.810\n>> Netherlands, yeah.\n\n402\n00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:13.770\n>> So it was a CA that was based out of\nNetherlands and they got compromised.\n\n403\n00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:14.840\nThey're out of business now.\n\n404\n00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.220\nIt completely shut them down.\n\n405\n00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.680\nAll their certs were revoked and\nthen that was the end of it.\n\n406\n00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.590\nAnd speaking of revoked, that's another\nthing that these providers do is,\n\n407\n00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:24.600\nif a certificate gets compromised\nthey can pull it back.\n\n408\n00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.290\nAnd they pull it back with what's called\na CRL, or Certificate Revocation List.\n\n409\n00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:32.345\nAnd so I've kind of got that here on\nthe chart where the CRL is stored on these\n\n410\n00:20:32.345 --> 00:20:33.360\nsubordinates CAs.\n\n411\n00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.180\nSo I've got a subordinate CA down here.\n\n412\n00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.000\nAnd there's a CRL.\n\n413\n00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.940\nSo at any time if I doubt the authenticity\nof a certificate, I can just come and\n\n414\n00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.790\nlook at this CRL and\nfind out if it's been revoked or not.\n\n415\n00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:47.140\nBut our clients can generate a key.\n\n416\n00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.850\nCan make a certificate signing\nrequest based on that and\n\n417\n00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:51.470\nsend it to the subordinate CA.\n\n418\n00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:54.870\nIf we pay the money and jump through\nthe hoops, they'll sign it and\n\n419\n00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.080\nthen we get a signed certificate\nthat we can then make available.\n\n420\n00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.030\nSo on your server you've already\ngot a self signed certificate and\n\n421\n00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.230\nyou can run with that.\n\n422\n00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:04.990\nBut if want to go out and\nbuy one you certainly can.\n\n423\n00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:08.390\nRight down here at the bottom you\ncan hit the little plus sign and\n\n424\n00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:12.740\nyou can choose to get\na trusted certificate.\n\n425\n00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:16.400\nAnd when you do that it's gonna launch\na little wizard that's gonna walk you\n\n426\n00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.460\nthrough the process of creating.\n\n427\n00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.610\nA certificate signing key.\n\n428\n00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.400\nYour gonna create a private key.\n\n429\n00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.750\nYou're gonna create a certificate\nsigning request based on that key and\n\n430\n00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.660\nthen you can send that to\na provider of your choice.\n\n431\n00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:32.590\nAnd when they sign it they'll then\nsend you back your public key.\n\n432\n00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:36.070\nSo this CSR it's actually\ncreated the private key first\n\n433\n00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:37.720\nthen we send it off to get sign.\n\n434\n00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.410\nWell, actually we generate the public key,\nthen we set it up and\n\n435\n00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.780\nthey sign it and then it all comes back.\n\n436\n00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:48.290\n>> Don, with the CSR,\nexcuse me let me get the acronym right.\n\n437\n00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:51.730\nI know we're talking obviously\nabout Apple and OSX,\n\n438\n00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:55.020\nis this an industry wide standard or is\nthis something that's specific to Apple?\n\n439\n00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.240\n>> It's industry wide.\n\n440\n00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.700\nI mean, the UI is different.\n\n441\n00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.200\n>> Sure.\n>> But the concept,\n\n442\n00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.640\neverything I just talked about\nthe whole first half of this episode\n\n443\n00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.480\nis identical in Windows,\nLinux, Unix, you name it.\n\n444\n00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.720\nThey all work the same way, cuz this\nis a global infrastructure, right?\n\n445\n00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.850\nSo I'm gonna generate\na certificate signing request here,\n\n446\n00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.770\nso I need to put in my host name and\nthis is important.\n\n447\n00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:16.100\nThe Host Name needs to be\nwhat the end users see.\n\n448\n00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.240\nRight?\nMy server is called\n\n449\n00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.732\nosx-server01.lab.itpro.tv, right?\n\n450\n00:22:22.732 --> 00:22:26.120\nBut in the DNS episode I showed you\nguys where you can put in aliases.\n\n451\n00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.657\nSo if the users are going to itpro.tv for\n\n452\n00:22:29.657 --> 00:22:32.960\nexample,that's what I would\nneed the certificate to match.\n\n453\n00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.702\nThe certificate needs to match whatever\nyou're users are connecting to.\n\n454\n00:22:35.702 --> 00:22:38.390\nAll right so if it's an alias,\nyou gotta to map it to that.\n\n455\n00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:42.490\nThen we can specify you're email address,\ndon@itpro.tv.\n\n456\n00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:45.910\nCompany or organization,\nthis would be iTProTv.\n\n457\n00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.010\nDepartment, what's our department, Wes?\n\n458\n00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:49.030\n>> I don't know.\n\n459\n00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:50.642\n>> We'll just say ACTC.\n\n460\n00:22:50.642 --> 00:22:52.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And your town or city.\n\n461\n00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:53.990\nOn the state or province,\n\n462\n00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:57.060\nthis one's kind of important because you\nneed to write out your state or province.\n\n463\n00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.960\nDon't use the abbreviations,\nthey get really sensitive about that.\n\n464\n00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.100\nAnd if they reject your CSR you\nhave to generate a new key, so\n\n465\n00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.410\nyou don't want to do that necessarily,\nall right?\n\n466\n00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:12.100\nSo I'll move forward on that and what's\ngonna happen is it's gonna generate a CSR.\n\n467\n00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.720\nNow the CSR, this is kind of hard\nto see cuz it's word wrapping and\n\n468\n00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:20.020\nthere's not much I can do about that, but\nthe CSR is kind of a jumbled mess, right?\n\n469\n00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.150\nLet me show you one of my other CSRs.\n\n470\n00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:24.150\nMaybe we can read this\none a little better.\n\n471\n00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:27.350\nCan I open that with like TextEdit or\nsomething?\n\n472\n00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:30.170\nThey're just text files, so\nyou can always open them in text edit.\n\n473\n00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.130\nIt might not map them for\nyou, but it will work.\n\n474\n00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.930\nAnd there we go.\n\n475\n00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.460\nSo this is a certificate signing request,\n\n476\n00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:44.270\nand that didn't help, did it?\n\n477\n00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:47.060\nThe things we go through for readability.\n\n478\n00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.650\nSo see how it says\nBegin Certificate Request and\n\n479\n00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:53.096\nthen there's this whole jumbled\nmess of letters and numbers?\n\n480\n00:23:53.096 --> 00:23:55.078\nWhat's in there?\n\n481\n00:23:55.078 --> 00:23:58.160\nIn the background we\ngenerated a private key.\n\n482\n00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.540\nBased on that private key,\nit created a public key.\n\n483\n00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:03.675\nThe public key is in this mess.\n\n484\n00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:09.820\nAlso in this mess is my email address,\n\n485\n00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:15.760\nmy server name, the city,\nthe state was in there.\n\n486\n00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.700\nAll other stuff that's in here too.\n\n487\n00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:18.240\nAll right.\n\n488\n00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.710\nAnd this is the public key.\n\n489\n00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.160\nIf somebody gets this,\nam I worried about that?\n\n490\n00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.250\nNo, it's the public key.\n\n491\n00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.450\nIt's a public key that nobody trusts.\n\n492\n00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:29.760\nSo in this form,\nit's a public key that nobody trusts.\n\n493\n00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:34.720\nI'm gonna send this to Verisign,\nDigicert, whoever, right?\n\n494\n00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.430\nThose guys will look at it, they'll look\nat the information, my email address,\n\n495\n00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.300\nmy city, my state, and\nthey're gonna verify it's true.\n\n496\n00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.110\nThey'll call you on the phone, they'll\nmake you send documents to prove that it's\n\n497\n00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:48.310\ntrue, and once they prove that it's true,\nthey'll sign it.\n\n498\n00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:52.930\nThey'll put their digital signature on it,\nand now it becomes a signed\n\n499\n00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:55.840\npublic key that I can use on my servers,\nto hand out to other people.\n\n500\n00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.250\nAnd people will trust it.\n\n501\n00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:01.650\n>> Don, is this garbled mess that we\nsee of string of characters or letters.\n\n502\n00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:06.910\nIs this safe to say it's like some kind of\nmessage digest of the whole entire file?\n\n503\n00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:07.470\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n504\n00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:10.100\nIt's cipher text, and\nit's generated off of that file.\n\n505\n00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.750\nAnd it's not, this is reversible you can\nactually there's a couple of websites you\n\n506\n00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:17.170\nfeed this into, and it will reverse it and\nshow you the data that's inside of it.\n\n507\n00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:18.590\nIt's not sensitive right.\n\n508\n00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:22.130\nIt's the private key that's sensitive and\nthe private key really looks the same.\n\n509\n00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.830\nIn OS 10 they don't show\nyou the private key, right.\n\n510\n00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:26.160\nWhen you generate this.\n\n511\n00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.340\nIf I save this CSR.\n\n512\n00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.130\nI'll just save it here to my documents.\n\n513\n00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.840\nAnd I finish, it made a private key.\n\n514\n00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.060\nAnd see how it shows right here at\nIT Pro.TV and it's pending, right.\n\n515\n00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.490\nI never actually saw the private key,\nbut it made it.\n\n516\n00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.710\nIt's back there somewhere,\nwe just don't see it, right?\n\n517\n00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.360\nAnd if I double click on it,\nall it's doing is offering for\n\n518\n00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.880\nme to edit the request.\n\n519\n00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.770\nOr to copy in the answer, the signed\ncert that I got from the provider, and\n\n520\n00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.040\nI can throw that in there.\n\n521\n00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.560\nAnd I'll have it, okay.\n\n522\n00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.800\nBut it did make a private key.\n\n523\n00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.850\nAnd so in this other\ncertificate that I've got here,\n\n524\n00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:01.060\nthis is one of our old ones\nwhere I've got the private key,\n\n525\n00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.470\nI've got the CSR we sent off and\nI've got the response.\n\n526\n00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:08.180\nThese are all expired,\nthey were generated back in 2014.\n\n527\n00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.480\nWhen you buy a cert you can pick an amount\nof time that you want it to be valid for\n\n528\n00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.140\nand after that validity period,\nit's no longer good it's expired and\n\n529\n00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.300\nthat's the end of it.\n\n530\n00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.980\nIf you already have\na certificate like I do here,\n\n531\n00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.830\nwhat you can do is down here at the bottom\nwhen you hit that little plus sign\n\n532\n00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:28.330\ninstead of get a trusted cert, you can\nchoose import a certificate identity.\n\n533\n00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.190\nAnd you can import one\nthat you've already got.\n\n534\n00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:31.620\nAnd it's going to ask for three things.\n\n535\n00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:35.060\nIt's going to ask for the private key,\nit's gonna ask for the public certificate,\n\n536\n00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:39.940\nthe one that's signed, and it's gonna ask\nfor any other certificates you might have.\n\n537\n00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:43.520\nThese are what's called\nthe certificate authority chain and\n\n538\n00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.380\nthat might have your CA and\nother certs in it.\n\n539\n00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.988\nAnd you can just take these\ncerts that you've got and\n\n540\n00:26:48.988 --> 00:26:52.170\ndrag and drop them right onto\nwhere they're supposed to be.\n\n541\n00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.770\nSo this is my private keys,\nso I can throw that on there.\n\n542\n00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:58.240\nAnd this is my cert and\nI can drag and drop that on there.\n\n543\n00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.250\nAnd so it's loading it in.\n\n544\n00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:04.160\nAnd then you can provide any other\ncert chain identities that you have.\n\n545\n00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.890\nI don't have any, but\nyou can throw them in there.\n\n546\n00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.550\nOnce you import them,\nit's going to load them in.\n\n547\n00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:09.790\nAnd now you've got it.\n\n548\n00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:10.350\nOkay.\n\n549\n00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:14.040\nAnd notice how mine has a big red\ncircle with an x on it, right?\n\n550\n00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.060\nAnd that's cuz if I look over here,\nit expired October 15th, 2015.\n\n551\n00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.050\nIt expired six months ago.\n\n552\n00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:24.050\nSo it's an expired certificate,\nI shouldn't use it.\n\n553\n00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.430\nBut, it was signed by GeoTrust.\n\n554\n00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.470\nThis is one that you guys trust.\n\n555\n00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.060\nNow Wes, you asked a question earlier,\nI think I dodged it,\n\n556\n00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.810\nwhich was how do we trust these people?\n\n557\n00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:36.690\nAnd I talked about the operating\nsystems and the vendors,\n\n558\n00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.170\nbut you can actually see who\nyou trust if you want, right?\n\n559\n00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:43.700\nSo here on your Mac, if you go into,\nI'm just gonna pull up Spotlight and\n\n560\n00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.400\nI'm gonna launch\nthe Keychain Access utility.\n\n561\n00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.430\nIf you launch the Keychain Access\nutility in here,\n\n562\n00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:52.120\nyou have a little certificate box.\n\n563\n00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.670\nAnd under certificates, you can see\ninformation about your certificates.\n\n564\n00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:56.420\nSee mine's nice and empty?\n\n565\n00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:57.800\nWell that's because I'm on log in.\n\n566\n00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.290\nThese are log in certificates.\n\n567\n00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:02.950\nIf you look at local items or\nsystem, there we go.\n\n568\n00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:07.050\nThere's that sandbox.itpro.tv\nexpired cert that I loaded.\n\n569\n00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:11.560\nAnd there's OSX-SERVER01.local, the self\nsigned certificate the server app created.\n\n570\n00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.170\nThese are the ones that we\nare working with right now.\n\n571\n00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:18.350\nBut the one I really wanna show\nyou is System Roots, right?\n\n572\n00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:20.400\nAnd when you go under System Roots.\n\n573\n00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.390\nThere we go.\n[LAUGH] I\n\n574\n00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:23.820\nhad a moment of panic there\ncuz it wasn't updating.\n\n575\n00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:27.714\nWhen you go under System Roots,\nthese are the one's that Apple said,\n\n576\n00:28:27.714 --> 00:28:30.700\nApple looked at these and\nsaid, these guys are okay.\n\n577\n00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.460\nYou can trust these, right?\n\n578\n00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.530\nAnd so when you look,\nyou're gonna see some people like Apple.\n\n579\n00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:37.540\nBelieve it or not,\nApple said you should trust Apple.\n\n580\n00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:39.240\nAnd that was not too far of a stretch,\nright?\n\n581\n00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.850\nBut we also see AddTrust, AffirmTrust,\n\n582\n00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.830\nANF Global,\nI've never heard of any of those, right?\n\n583\n00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:50.700\nAs we keep looking, Belgium Root,\nI've never been to Belgium.\n\n584\n00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.040\nBuypass.\n\n585\n00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.070\nNever heard of them.\n\n586\n00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:54.020\nCertum.\n\n587\n00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:54.980\nCisco.\nAll right,\n\n588\n00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.730\nthere's the first one I've seen so\nfar that I recognize, and\n\n589\n00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:00.800\nCisco doesn't even sell public certs,\nso that's kind of an odd one.\n\n590\n00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.880\nBut if we keep looking, there's DigiCert.\n\n591\n00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.880\nI think I said earlier I like DigiCert.\n\n592\n00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.610\nAnd so, you've got DigiCert right here,\nall these different ones.\n\n593\n00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:11.060\nSo if somebody out there is using\na certificate that's signed by DigiCert,\n\n594\n00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.310\nyour Mac is going to trust it by default.\n\n595\n00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:16.230\nAnd you can add in your own root.\n\n596\n00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.860\nIf you create your own\nroot you can add it here.\n\n597\n00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.410\nIf you create an open directory\nthat happens automatically.\n\n598\n00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:24.703\nYour open directory server becomes\na CA and when people buy into the open\n\n599\n00:29:24.703 --> 00:29:31.510\ndirectory, they'll copy the public key\nto your CA and drop it right in here.\n\n600\n00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:34.570\nSo they'll trust it, and they'll have\nthat functionality, it'll be available.\n\n601\n00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:38.840\n>> Now, Don, is it safe to say with\nyour explanation here, that Apple has\n\n602\n00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:42.540\ndone the work beforehand, they've\ncommunicated with these CAs out here,\n\n603\n00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.540\nthey said okay,\nwe've established that you are secure.\n\n604\n00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:49.410\nSo what they've done is they've taken\nthose private keys, or the public keys,\n\n605\n00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:52.640\nexcuse me, and they've basically\nembedded them into a protective location\n\n606\n00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.800\nwithin the operating system itself?\n\n607\n00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.400\n>> Yeah, that's basically it.\n\n608\n00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.770\nIt's a protected spot.\n\n609\n00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.330\nA virus can't go in and\njust start ejecting certificates, right.\n\n610\n00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.410\nThe key chain itself gets locked.\n\n611\n00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.945\nAnd so when you log in with your\nusername and your password,\n\n612\n00:30:04.945 --> 00:30:07.290\nyou're unlocking that key chain for\nyour access.\n\n613\n00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:09.590\nAnd when you log out,\nthe key chain is being locked again.\n\n614\n00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.120\nIt's being locked with an encryption key.\n\n615\n00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.660\nAnd the encryption key is your password.\n\n616\n00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.720\nIf you ever change your password for\nyour user account,\n\n617\n00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.540\nthe password on the keychain has to be\nchanged also because it's now different.\n\n618\n00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:22.980\nSo that process happens when\nyou do a password reset, and\n\n619\n00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:26.040\nthat stops third party software\nfrom tampering with your roots.\n\n620\n00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:30.090\nIf somebody could add an unauthorized\nroot cert to your list,\n\n621\n00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:31.760\nwho knows what you would trust from there.\n\n622\n00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:36.030\nI mean you'd really compromise\nsecurity on a pretty widespread basis.\n\n623\n00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:36.674\nNot a good thing.\n\n624\n00:30:36.674 --> 00:30:39.330\n[LAUGH] So, I think is that a trademark?\n\n625\n00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:39.900\nNot a good thing.\n\n626\n00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.200\nSo, but yeah,\nthose are basically the certificates.\n\n627\n00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.470\nThis is all happening behind the scenes,\nit's really important to understand what's\n\n628\n00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:48.700\ngoing on, even though we don't\nreally have to interact with it.\n\n629\n00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:51.500\nYou might choose to buy a public cert,\nin which case you'll run through\n\n630\n00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.900\nthat wizard that I showed you and then\ngo out and buy the cert and load it in.\n\n631\n00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.820\nYou might just stick with self sign certs.\n\n632\n00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:00.210\nAnd if you stick with self sign certs, you\ndon't have to do much to administer them.\n\n633\n00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:02.380\nLet me just show you the one\nthing you'll have to do.\n\n634\n00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:06.320\nThat self sign cert that was generated\non my system, it does expire.\n\n635\n00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.710\nIt expires a while from now, right?\n\n636\n00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:13.860\nEvery time you upgrade the server app\nfrom one major version to another,\n\n637\n00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.910\nit will update that certificate.\n\n638\n00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:19.660\nBut if you don't update your server app,\nyou might have an older certificate.\n\n639\n00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.770\nIf I take a look at my self signed one,\n\n640\n00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:25.080\nit shows an expiration date of April 26,\n2018.\n\n641\n00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.920\nOkay, that's two years from now.\n\n642\n00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.060\nSo it made a two year certificate.\n\n643\n00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:33.650\nWell, if I update to server version 6, a\nyear from now it'll renew that for me and\n\n644\n00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:34.920\nI won't have to worry about it.\n\n645\n00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:39.820\nBut if I don't, if I'm still running\nserver version 5, come April 26,\n\n646\n00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.640\n2018, this certificate will expire, right?\n\n647\n00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.740\nSo I need to renew it.\n\n648\n00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.510\nAnd renewing it is pretty easy.\n\n649\n00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:48.610\nYou just double click on it and this\nscreen will pop up and you've got a nice\n\n650\n00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:52.320\nlittle Renew button right here at\nthe bottom, and so you can hit Renew, and\n\n651\n00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.630\nbecause it's a self signed certificate,\nit just renews it and that's it.\n\n652\n00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:59.310\nIf it's a public certificate, when you hit\nRenew, It's gonna have to reach out to\n\n653\n00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:01.210\nthat provider and\ngo through that renew process.\n\n654\n00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:04.770\nSo, you need to go to the provider's\nwebsite, update the cert, they'll generate\n\n655\n00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:07.860\na new key for you, and when you hit\nRenew down here, you'll have to drag and\n\n656\n00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.210\ndrop that key onto it and now it's\nupdated, so a little bit different.\n\n657\n00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:15.470\nBut, once I hit this,\nit's gonna renew and apparently,\n\n658\n00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:17.700\nit's going to take it's time or\nis there a window in the background?\n\n659\n00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.130\nNope, it's just taking it's time.\n\n660\n00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.210\nBut eventually it will renew and\nupdate itself and\n\n661\n00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:24.970\nthen we'll be ready to rock and now it\nwill be good for two more years, right?.\n\n662\n00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:27.520\nNot two years on the end of it,\nbut two years from today,\n\n663\n00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:32.330\nwhich I guess it was already generated\ntoday so I can't even tell now.\n\n664\n00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:35.410\nIt just launched it this morning I guess.\n\n665\n00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:37.960\nBut now it's renewed and\nit's ready to go for another two years.\n\n666\n00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.830\nThat's really about it from\nthe maintenance side on the certificates.\n\n667\n00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:42.880\n>> Very good,\na lot of great information in this one.\n\n668\n00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.110\nA lot of security centric information Don.\n\n669\n00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.410\nI appreciate you explaining all that.\n\n670\n00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:50.690\nIt does look like we are coming to\nthe end of another great episode here.\n\n671\n00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.375\nSo Don before we do,\nany parting words of wisdom,\n\n672\n00:32:53.375 --> 00:32:55.550\nespecially on the certificate side?\n\n673\n00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:56.660\n>> That's about it.\n\n674\n00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.650\nBig, big important lesson.\n\n675\n00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:00.110\nIf you buy public certificates or\n\n676\n00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:04.660\neven using the private ones, put their\nexpiration date on your calendar, right?\n\n677\n00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.670\nEven big companies have made mistakes.\n\n678\n00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.150\nApple made a mistake just,\nit was like a month ago.\n\n679\n00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:12.170\nThey let one of their\ncertificates expire and a ton of\n\n680\n00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:16.100\napps from the iOS app store couldn't run\nanymore until they fixed that certificate.\n\n681\n00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.400\nSo even big companies make that mistake.\n\n682\n00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.590\nIt's so easy to avoid it.\n\n683\n00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:23.990\nAnytime you buy a certificate put\nthe expiration date on your calendar.\n\n684\n00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.980\nAnd what I normally do is set\nup reminder two months ahead.\n\n685\n00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:30.990\nAnd that way, I might buy two certificates\nand I'll forget about the certificate.\n\n686\n00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:34.380\nBut 16 months from now,\nor 20 months from now,\n\n687\n00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.860\nwhenever it is that you set it, you get a\nreminder hey, you need to renew this cert.\n\n688\n00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:40.430\nAnd that way you can plan for\nrenewing it and go through that process.\n\n689\n00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.390\nCuz renewals are not\nnecessarily immediate.\n\n690\n00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:45.600\nSometimes they can take a few days or\neven a week to go through that process.\n\n691\n00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.820\nSo you don't wanna wait till it's expired,\nyou wanna do it ahead of time.\n\n692\n00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:50.370\nPut it on your calendar.\n\n693\n00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:51.710\n>> Thank you for that information, Don.\n\n694\n00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:53.880\nAnd thank you to our viewers out there for\nwatching.\n\n695\n00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.390\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign out here with ITProTV.\n\n696\n00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:57.490\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n697\n00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:58.510\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n698\n00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.416\n>> And we'll see you

00:00:16.310\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.550\nAnd in today's episode we are moving\nalong in our OSX Server Essentials.\n\n5\n00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.490\nAnd we've got, back in the studios,\nnone other than Mr.Don Pizet.\n\n6\n00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.810\nWelcome and how you doing, Don.\n\n7\n00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.838\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n8\n00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:28.530\nWe're gonna dive right back\ninto OSX server essentials.\n\n9\n00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.690\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna take a\nlook at something that's pretty important.\n\n10\n00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.930\nAnd that's monitoring our server.\n\n11\n00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.250\nWe've seen in the earlier episodes,\ngetting the server app set-up.\n\n12\n00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.170\nPretty easy, right.\n\n13\n00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.660\nYou go to the app store, you install it.\n\n14\n00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.780\nGetting it running.\n\n15\n00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.860\nPretty easy,\nyou just click on the button, right.\n\n16\n00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.890\nCertificates.\n\n17\n00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.230\nThey're already configured for you.\n\n18\n00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.820\nMost of what we do in\nthe server app is super easy.\n\n19\n00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.130\nThat's kind of Apple's claim to fame.\n\n20\n00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.400\nAnd when things are working right,\nthat's great.\n\n21\n00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.000\nIt's nice and it's easy,\nwe can get this stuff in place.\n\n22\n00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.860\nBut from time to time things go wrong.\n\n23\n00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.490\nEspecially after upgrades.\n\n24\n00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.940\nAnd so\nif something goes wrong what do you do.\n\n25\n00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.140\nThere's no easy button\nthat says fix the problem.\n\n26\n00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.280\nSo you've got to find the problem and\n\n27\n00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.410\nresolve it and fortunately apple gives us\na lot of tools to be able to monitor and\n\n28\n00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.200\nmaintain our server right\nfrom within the server app.\n\n29\n00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.170\nAnd that's important because we've\ngot to ton of troubleshooting tools\n\n30\n00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.000\noutside of the server app, right.\n\n31\n00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.650\nBut if you're managing a system remotely\nyou might not have access to all of that.\n\n32\n00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.110\nSo if I'm on a work station and\nI'm SSHed into a system or\n\n33\n00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.380\nif I'm VNC to see the screen that's\ngreat I have access to that stuff.\n\n34\n00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.530\nBut if all I have is the server\napp I need tools and\n\n35\n00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.820\nresources in the server app\nto be able to manage it.\n\n36\n00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.030\nAnd we've actually got quite a few.\n\n37\n00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.580\nSo let's walk through what we've got here.\n\n38\n00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.750\nSo I'm on my server and I've just\nkind of launched into my server app.\n\n39\n00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.480\nAnd this is that main default screen\nwhere it gives you some basic\n\n40\n00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.000\ninformation about the system and so on.\n\n41\n00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.410\nAnd you get a quick health check\nright here on your main screen.\n\n42\n00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.720\nSee these three green dots.\n\n43\n00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.400\nIt doesn't matter that I really\ndon't have any services running.\n\n44\n00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.910\nI have file sharing and DNS I guess.\n\n45\n00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.720\nBut, here's some quick dots.\n\n46\n00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.850\nAnd what these are telling us is first,\ndo I have a valid host name.\n\n47\n00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.670\nWell, you pretty much always have\na valid host name unless there's\n\n48\n00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.400\na duplicate on the network, so\nyou'll normally have a green dot there.\n\n49\n00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.750\nThen, my computer name.\n\n50\n00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.250\nNow notice how my host name and\nmy computer name are different.\n\n51\n00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.950\nThe host name It's a fully\nqualified domain name and\n\n52\n00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.144\nmy is called OSX-SERVER01.local,\nthat's fine in a local network but\n\n53\n00:02:22.144 --> 00:02:25.320\nif this one is gonna be exposed to\nthe internet, that might be a problem,\n\n54\n00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.630\nmight need to adjust that and change it,\nthat's gonna be an issue right.\n\n55\n00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.900\nBut I have my green dots which says at\nleast as it is right now, it works and\n\n56\n00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.580\nthe next one is internet.\n\n57\n00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.800\nIf this is a local server,\nI don't care about this.\n\n58\n00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.840\nBut if I'm connected to the internet,\nI do.\n\n59\n00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.840\nThis one is reachable at 209.251.159.179,\nthat's my public IP and\n\n60\n00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.320\nI can get on the Internet so\nI got a green light.\n\n61\n00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.705\nBut it tells me no services available.\n\n62\n00:02:48.705 --> 00:02:50.820\nWhat the heck does that mean.\n\n63\n00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.570\nNo services,\nwell I have File Sharing turned on.\n\n64\n00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.620\nAnd I have DNS turned on.\n\n65\n00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.910\nShouldn't this say those are available.\n\n66\n00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.070\nWell, here at the ITProTV\nstudios we have a firewall.\n\n67\n00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.450\nAnd the firewalls blocking outside\npeople from getting to this system.\n\n68\n00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.570\nAnd so it's showing no services available.\n\n69\n00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.860\nSo even though I've got a green light,\nmy server can get to the internet.\n\n70\n00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.940\nAnd I've got a public IP.\n\n71\n00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.670\nI have no services available because\nthe firewall is blocking it.\n\n72\n00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.650\nSo I can use this to quickly tell whether\nor not internet access is possible, right.\n\n73\n00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.910\nIf I'm not doing internet access,\nI don't care about that.\n\n74\n00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.080\nAnd so that's why the light's green even\nthough it says no services available.\n\n75\n00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.190\nApple knows that this is\na very common set up.\n\n76\n00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.390\nBut its one quick place\nthat you can look and\n\n77\n00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.420\nyou can go into reachability details\nTo get a quick breakdown on that.\n\n78\n00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.190\nSo I can see that my status is enabled.\n\n79\n00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.220\nI've got that external IP.\n\n80\n00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.110\nI don't have a public host\nname cuz I didn't set it and\n\n81\n00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.870\nnone of my services are available.\n\n82\n00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.200\nIf I'm not gonna use internet access,\nI'm just gonna hit disable.\n\n83\n00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.550\nAnd we can turn off internet reachabilty,\nright.\n\n84\n00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.530\nWhen I do that,\nnow I'm just a local server, right.\n\n85\n00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.440\nAnd reachability is unknown.\n\n86\n00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.650\nMost of the time when you deploy a server,\nyou just wanted to be local.\n\n87\n00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.640\nAnd unless you setting up a web server and\nyou want that to be public.\n\n88\n00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.630\nSo might want to disable this test,\n\n89\n00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.080\nno sense in this thing testing it every\ntime if I'm not actually gonna use it.\n\n90\n00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.770\nAll right.\nSo\n\n91\n00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.950\nthat's one example of a quick thing that\nwe can monitor right here from the inside\n\n92\n00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:13.960\nof the server App.\n\n93\n00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.170\nLet's take a look and what I think\nis probably the most important one.\n\n94\n00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.720\nAnd that's our logs.\n\n95\n00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.390\nIf you went through our ACA shows, or even\nthe ACSP show, I talked about logs and\n\n96\n00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.780\nhow we can maintain them, and\nin those shows we use the Console app.\n\n97\n00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.430\nSo if you launch Console, you can see\nthe system logs for your computer.\n\n98\n00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.940\nYour server app is logging to this.\n\n99\n00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.450\nThe only problem is, your server app\nisn't the only thing logging into this.\n\n100\n00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.460\nYou're going to have your\nown operating system and\n\n101\n00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.030\nall sorts of other applications\nall logging in here too.\n\n102\n00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.320\nSo it gets really cluttered, right.\n\n103\n00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.260\nThere's just a lot of stuff in here\nthat doesn't necessarily pertain\n\n104\n00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.580\nto the server app.\n\n105\n00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.290\nAnd if I'm monitoring remotely.\n\n106\n00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.320\nSo for example if I'm over here on\nsome work station like this one, And\n\n107\n00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.750\nI fire up the server app.\n\n108\n00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.390\nWell actually here if i\njust fire up console.\n\n109\n00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.810\nSo if I fire up the console I'm seeing\nthe logs for this work station.\n\n110\n00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.980\nNot the server that's out\nthere on the network.\n\n111\n00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.390\nSo if I fire up my server app\nwhich apparently is not going to\n\n112\n00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.420\nshow up as following for me but\nif I fire up the server app and\n\n113\n00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.750\nI connect to a remote server, right.\n\n114\n00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.910\nSo I'll just connect to that server.\n\n115\n00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.080\nAnd let me just punch in my credentials.\n\n116\n00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.240\nNow when I connect that's great.\n\n117\n00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.760\nI'm going to get connected.\n\n118\n00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.090\nAnd now I'm seeing the server but\n\n119\n00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.920\nmy console app is not going to show\nthe logs for that server, right.\n\n120\n00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.400\nSo how can I remote leave you those logs.\n\n121\n00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.880\nWell fortunately,\nright here we've got logs.\n\n122\n00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.620\nAnd there's nothing in here that\nI won't see in the console app.\n\n123\n00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.480\nThe big difference is, it's two things.\n\n124\n00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.990\nOne, it's filtered to just the server app.\n\n125\n00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.650\nSo I don't get all the clutter\nof the other applications and\n\n126\n00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:55.430\nthe operating system.\n\n127\n00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.790\nJust seeing things that\npertain to the server app.\n\n128\n00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.500\nAnd two, it's accessible remotely.\n\n129\n00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.560\nSo on that client over here,\nwhen I launch the console lap,\n\n130\n00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.410\nI'm just seeing this workstation's logs.\n\n131\n00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.000\nBut when I launch the server app,\nand I connect to the server and\n\n132\n00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.680\nI go to Logs, Now, I'm seeing the server\nlogs from that remote server.\n\n133\n00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.882\nSo, now I can remotely see those logs and\nstart to look for problems.\n\n134\n00:06:17.882 --> 00:06:20.410\n>> Now Don, it looks like there's\na lot of information still in there.\n\n135\n00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:25.395\nWhat happens if your, let's say your DNS\nhappens to be running on that server.\n\n136\n00:06:25.395 --> 00:06:26.735\nAnd that's really what I wanna look at.\n\n137\n00:06:26.735 --> 00:06:28.175\nI wanna look at the specific service.\n\n138\n00:06:28.175 --> 00:06:31.325\nIs there a way that we can make this a\nlittle bit more administratively feasible\n\n139\n00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:32.740\nor I would say useful.\n\n140\n00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.875\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n141\n00:06:33.875 --> 00:06:36.725\nit's a rare day that I look\nat this right here, right.\n\n142\n00:06:36.725 --> 00:06:39.995\nWhen you first go to logs you're\nlooking at the System Log, the syslog.\n\n143\n00:06:39.995 --> 00:06:41.515\nAnd the syslog is big.\n\n144\n00:06:41.515 --> 00:06:45.565\nIt does have the full log of operating\nsystem and other applications and\n\n145\n00:06:45.565 --> 00:06:46.640\nthings like that.\n\n146\n00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.560\nIt's cluttered, right.\n\n147\n00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.240\nThis is that view that I told you I didn't\nwant to use because it's too cluttered.\n\n148\n00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.120\nWell, right down on the bottom,\nyou can filter it.\n\n149\n00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.370\nNow, what you're going to see when you\nclick on that menu is going to vary based\n\n150\n00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.990\non your system, all right.\n\n151\n00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.010\nAt a minimum, you'll see what's\ncalled a service log, and\n\n152\n00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.150\nthe service log will be log entries for\nthat particular service.\n\n153\n00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.480\nSo, I've got a caching service log,\nDACP service log, DNS service log.\n\n154\n00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.420\nAnd this service log is actually\nthe same across all of these.\n\n155\n00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.350\nBecause it's a log for\nthe services starting and stopping.\n\n156\n00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.900\nOnce I start a stopped services,\nI might see new things appear, right.\n\n157\n00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.150\nSo for example, we have dhcp service log,\ndns service log, messages, net install.\n\n158\n00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.520\nLet me go turn some of these actually on.\n\n159\n00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.360\nSo I'll turn on,\nlet me turn on like caching\n\n160\n00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.770\nI'm just gonna leave them at the default\nand just turn this stuff on.\n\n161\n00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.830\nNot enough disk space for\n\n162\n00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.050\ncaching, but I can turn on the calendar,\nwe'll turn on contacts, mail.\n\n163\n00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.087\nSo I'm just flipping these guys on, so\n\n164\n00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:46.435\nI'm basically just setting myself up as\nmany different kinds of servers, right.\n\n165\n00:07:46.435 --> 00:07:49.639\nAnd with each one of these, as they start,\n\n166\n00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:54.005\nwhat it's gonna do is,\nshoot, Windows Time Machine.\n\n167\n00:07:54.005 --> 00:07:56.811\nWhat it's going to do is it's\ngoing to start them up and\n\n168\n00:07:56.811 --> 00:07:58.161\nI may see new logs appear.\n\n169\n00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:03.970\nLogs that pertain to particular aspects of\nthese things' functionality, all right?\n\n170\n00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.670\nAnd so as I start to flip these things on,\nwe may see new logs appear.\n\n171\n00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.920\nAnd so as I jump back to my Logs screen,\nand I hit that box,\n\n172\n00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.970\nearlier I had Mail, and\nit didn't have anything beneath it.\n\n173\n00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:22.230\nNow I've got Anti-Virus Database Update,\nAnti-Virus Service Log, IMAP, Junk Mail,\n\n174\n00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.720\nall of these additional logs that\npertain to functions of the mail server.\n\n175\n00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.620\nSame thing with messages.\n\n176\n00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.080\nBefore I had messages and servers log.\n\n177\n00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.240\nNow I've got multi-user chat log and\nproxy log.\n\n178\n00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.830\nSo I can see the information that\nis gathered right here nice and\n\n179\n00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.170\nfiltered down to just\nthat one application.\n\n180\n00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:44.250\n>> Don is it fair to say that the control\npanel at the top there is a good for\n\n181\n00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.030\na quick heads up overview of\nwhat's going on currently?\n\n182\n00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.330\nCould you use the logs for\nmore like trending analysis,\n\n183\n00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.280\nyou're looking at maybe\na service over a period of time?\n\n184\n00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.850\n>> It's not great for\ntrending per say, right?\n\n185\n00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.220\nBecause when you look at the logs, I mean,\nit just dumps it right there, right?\n\n186\n00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.680\nSo if I wanted to use this for trending\nto see if I'm having a recurring problem,\n\n187\n00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.720\nI would have to read days and days worth\nof logs and identify a pattern in there.\n\n188\n00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.940\nIt's not really great for\npattern tracking, right?\n\n189\n00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.440\nYou have other things like the stats\nscreen that can do a little bit better of\n\n190\n00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.240\na job for that.\n\n191\n00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.680\nSo, for example, over here instead\nof Logs, if I click on Stats, now I\n\n192\n00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:25.310\ncan start to monitor things like Processor\nusage, or Memory, or Bytes Served, right?\n\n193\n00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:26.580\nAnd I can see this.\n\n194\n00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.200\nOver a period of time.\n\n195\n00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.850\nAnd so we can start to watch that and\nsee if our trends are changing.\n\n196\n00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.060\nOn the logs,\nit kind of left up to you to interpret it.\n\n197\n00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.910\nSo for example,\nlet's say I get a call from a user, and\n\n198\n00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:41.170\nthey're telling me, hey Don,\nthe chat server's not working.\n\n199\n00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.870\nI'm trying to chat and\nI don't see anybody else out there.\n\n200\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.550\nOther people are logged in but\nthey're not seeing me.\n\n201\n00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.970\nWell, I can come in here under Logs,\nI can go to this drop-down box,\n\n202\n00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.760\nI can find messages, and\nI can go to the service log, all right?\n\n203\n00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.150\nAnd right here,\nsee how everything says Jabber D?\n\n204\n00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.840\nWell iMessage is actually\npowered by the Jabber protocol.\n\n205\n00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.660\nSo this is the Jabber daemon, so I see all\nthese logs based on the Jabber daemon.\n\n206\n00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.860\nAnd now I can watch it and\nsee if somebody fires up a connection, and\n\n207\n00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:10.830\ngets connected to it.\n\n208\n00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.480\nRight.\nSo if I fire up messages, and I go and\n\n209\n00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.960\nconnect to this server.\n\n210\n00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.570\nRight.\n\n211\n00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.910\nSo let me,\nlet me see if I can get connected.\n\n212\n00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.740\nI might not be able to get connected,\nnow that I think about it.\n\n213\n00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.430\nBut let's see if it'll let me connect.\n\n214\n00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:27.620\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\ndo a jabber connection for dpozet.\n\n215\n00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.050\nAnd the server is 192.168.0.151.\n\n216\n00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:35.920\nI'll see if it will let me sign in.\n\n217\n00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.790\nAlright there we go.\n\n218\n00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.360\nSo I'm signing in and getting connected.\n\n219\n00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.600\nThere's nobody out there for\nme to talk to.\n\n220\n00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.580\nI don't know, can I send myself a message?\n\n221\n00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.380\nI don't know if it will let me.\n\n222\n00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.070\nNo, it won't let me send a message.\n\n223\n00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.320\nTo myself or anything.\n\n224\n00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.110\nI need to have a some other\nkind of a recipient out there.\n\n225\n00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.504\nBut, basically as i start to work with\nthe in connect, these log files or\n\n226\n00:10:56.504 --> 00:10:58.967\nupdate and\nyou will start to see those connections.\n\n227\n00:10:58.967 --> 00:11:04.275\nSo notice right here, we have got\na proxy connection that says online,\n\n228\n00:11:04.275 --> 00:11:08.358\nbound to 127.0.0.1, 56322, right.\n\n229\n00:11:08.358 --> 00:11:11.020\nThat's a loop back, i connected to myself.\n\n230\n00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.940\nAnd so it shows that connection.\n\n231\n00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.350\nIf I go to a client and\ntry and connect, right?\n\n232\n00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:20.900\nSo here on my client I'll fire up\nmessages, and I'll add that connection.\n\n233\n00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:25.010\nSo let me just skip, I'll connect\nwith a different message account.\n\n234\n00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:25.820\nI'll do Jabber.\n\n235\n00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.410\nI should probably create\na different account, but\n\n236\n00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:32.029\nwe'll just log in as myself so\nI can have multiple identities.\n\n237\n00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.630\nThat is always a good time, there we go,\nso now I'm logged in and connected, if i\n\n238\n00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:41.610\ngo back to the sever and look, this log\nfile it may take it a second to update,\n\n239\n00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:45.350\nand will show that connection coming\nin from the IP address of that client.\n\n240\n00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:49.890\nSo these log files updating to show those\nmessages, and now i can troubleshoot\n\n241\n00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:53.940\nbased on what is going on Right\nhere just inside of this service.\n\n242\n00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.670\nAnd you can pull up\nthe proxy logs to see that.\n\n243\n00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.870\nI've got the multi-user chat,\n\n244\n00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.630\nwhich I don't have any multi-user\nchats going on right now.\n\n245\n00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:02.600\nWe'll start to see those, too.\n\n246\n00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.540\nAnd you can track that and\ntroubleshoot just for that service,\n\n247\n00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.130\nwhich is a pretty handy thing to have.\n\n248\n00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:09.870\nSo, there you see it kinda updating.\n\n249\n00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.070\nSome more information appearing\njust as it works right.\n\n250\n00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:16.480\nAnd that's true for\nevery service that we've got.\n\n251\n00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.550\nIf email is going to junk mail you\ncan come in here and find out why or\n\n252\n00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.290\ndid it update, if there's errors in\nhere you can use that to try and\n\n253\n00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:25.580\nfind the problem and fix it right.\n\n254\n00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.860\nIn here, you're going to see errors.\n\n255\n00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.960\nYou're typically going to see causes\nright what's the cause of this problem,\n\n256\n00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.750\nso this is a great place to\ngo to find the root cause.\n\n257\n00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:40.030\nThe symptom is normally different right\nthe symptom is I can't get connected\n\n258\n00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.620\nwhy not maybe the service is crashing.\n\n259\n00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.170\nYou come in here and\n\n260\n00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.690\nyou find out a permissions problem\nis causing the service not to work.\n\n261\n00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.270\nRight.\nThat's the kind of stuff that you would\n\n262\n00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.130\nsee in here, and\nthen you can go and fix it.\n\n263\n00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.660\nThat's where logs really come in handy.\n\n264\n00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:52.470\n>> Don, when it comes to the,\n\n265\n00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:56.860\nyou mentioned a little bit about\nthe statistics or stats utility there.\n\n266\n00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.240\nAnd you said that it monitors\nthings like CPU utilization.\n\n267\n00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.390\nIs that the only thing?\n\n268\n00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.391\nI would assume not, but\nWhat else can we see with a stats utility?\n\n269\n00:13:04.391 --> 00:13:06.620\n>> Alright, so there's a couple\nof different things in here, and\n\n270\n00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.200\nlets kind of run through each one and\nwhat they can do for me right?\n\n271\n00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.500\nSo by default, when you go into the stats\nscreen you'll see what I've got on my\n\n272\n00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.960\nscreen right now, which is CPU, right?\n\n273\n00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.900\nHow busy is my processor.\n\n274\n00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.920\nAnd it breaks up into two pieces,\nsystem and user.\n\n275\n00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.630\nSystem is the operating system.\n\n276\n00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:27.690\nUser, those are applications that\nyou've run in your user space.\n\n277\n00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:31.710\nSo when I run Safari or\nother programs that's my user space.\n\n278\n00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.010\nAnd it's monitoring it by default for\nthe last 24 hours, right?\n\n279\n00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:38.520\nAnd I can change that, so\nhere's the last hour, and so\n\n280\n00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.120\nI can see that trending over time.\n\n281\n00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.990\nAnd we can start to generate\na lot of activity on the system\n\n282\n00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:51.080\nif I fire up Safari and I fire up the app\nstore and I launch the console and\n\n283\n00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:56.500\nremote desktop and I start launching all\nthese programs, I'm consuming CPU right.\n\n284\n00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:01.630\nAnd each one of these little commands is\n\n285\n00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:08.870\nbasically going to generate CPU\nutilization, and so it's gonna just start\n\n286\n00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:14.570\ngoing through and doing all this stuff and\nreally kinda bogging down the system.\n\n287\n00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.190\nAnd my system's gonna start getting\nslow cause I'm running a bunch of stuff,\n\n288\n00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:21.400\nbut what I hopefully will see is\nthat this will start to spike up\n\n289\n00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.910\non the next measurement interval.\n\n290\n00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:26.110\nNow notice that it's only\nmeasuring every couple of minutes.\n\n291\n00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:29.760\nThis is not a real time graph like\nwe can see in some other software\n\n292\n00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.150\nthe activity monitor comes to mind.\n\n293\n00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.450\nThe activity monitor is nice because\nyou can see real time things.\n\n294\n00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:39.200\nNotice home my CPU has a giant spike\nright there in the activity monitor,\n\n295\n00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.080\nbecause I'm doing a lot of\nactivity right now, right.\n\n296\n00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:46.280\nBut on the server app it's\ntrended over time, okay.\n\n297\n00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.350\nThe main reason is if you're\nrunning the server app remotely\n\n298\n00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.810\nit can't give you real time stats.\n\n299\n00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.060\nIt bogs the system down.\n\n300\n00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.130\nThis is much less of a load on the system.\n\n301\n00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.030\nAnd so this can give us those trends\nover a longer period of time.\n\n302\n00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.380\nWe can record it and\nsee how the system is doing.\n\n303\n00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.250\nThat's processor usage.\n\n304\n00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.120\nBut processor is not the only\nthing we care about.\n\n305\n00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.870\nIf you dive into it, you can see we've\ngot Memory, Memory Pressure, and\n\n306\n00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.510\nNetwork Traffic, right?\n\n307\n00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.820\nMemory Usage, that's your RAM.\n\n308\n00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.130\nTypically if you have\na server that's running slow,\n\n309\n00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.720\nRAM is usually the bottleneck, alright.\n\n310\n00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.610\nA lot of processes like the email\nserver use a lot of RAM.\n\n311\n00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:22.730\nThe Database server uses a lot of RAM.\n\n312\n00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:23.640\nNot service does, so\n\n313\n00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.960\nlike the file sharing, File sharing,\nit's really network bandwidth, not RAM.\n\n314\n00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.490\nIt doesn't have to cache a lot in RAM.\n\n315\n00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.970\nOpen directory uses a lot of CPU.\n\n316\n00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.440\nSo, it's not necessarily as reliant\non RAM as some of the other services.\n\n317\n00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.710\nIt's kind of a mix and match.\n\n318\n00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:41.440\nSo, your processor might be doing just\nfine and then you jump over to memory\n\n319\n00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.790\nusage and you see where you're\nconsuming most of your memory.\n\n320\n00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.960\nI've only got 2 gigs of\nRAM in this system, and\n\n321\n00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.531\nyou can see I'm floating\njust below 1.5 gigs of RAM.\n\n322\n00:15:49.531 --> 00:15:52.329\nI don't have a lot of headroom left over,\nall right.\n\n323\n00:15:52.329 --> 00:15:55.630\nWell, this chart can be\na little misleading sometimes,\n\n324\n00:15:55.630 --> 00:16:00.259\nbecause you have physical RAM, right,\nthe memory chips on your motherboard?\n\n325\n00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:02.661\nAnd then you have virtual RAM.\n\n326\n00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:06.098\nVirtual RAM is where you've exceeded\nwhat's on your physical RAM and so\n\n327\n00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:08.940\nit starts writing memory\nto the hard drive, right?\n\n328\n00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.190\nAnd the hard drive is way\nslower than your RAM is, right?\n\n329\n00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:14.040\nSo that's gonna hurt your performance.\n\n330\n00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.360\nAnd if we wanna see if that's happening,\n\n331\n00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.470\ninstead of Memory Usage,\nyou can choose Memory Pressure.\n\n332\n00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:23.881\nMemory Pressure shows how much of\nyour memory you're consuming in\n\n333\n00:16:23.881 --> 00:16:26.016\nterms of physical and virtual.\n\n334\n00:16:26.016 --> 00:16:30.947\nSo 100% here would be 100% of my memory,\nincluding the virtual side, and\n\n335\n00:16:30.947 --> 00:16:34.234\nI can see that I'm floating\na little over 50% here so\n\n336\n00:16:34.234 --> 00:16:36.959\nI'm probably in the 60% range right now.\n\n337\n00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:40.794\nI actually have a lot more head room here\nthan I did on the last screen where I was\n\n338\n00:16:40.794 --> 00:16:41.710\nat about 75%.\n\n339\n00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:45.260\nSo we can use this to measure and\n\n340\n00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.220\nget an idea of how that performance is and\nyou can view it over time.\n\n341\n00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.220\nNow my server hasn't been up for\n24 hours so I can't go back that far,\n\n342\n00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.190\nbut the longer your server has been up,\nthe further back this data will go.\n\n343\n00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.360\nWhat was the other one network, right?\n\n344\n00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.220\nNetwork was the other one and so\nwe could look at network traffic and\n\n345\n00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.020\nsee how much of your\nnetwork you're consuming.\n\n346\n00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.220\nIf you're running a file server for\nexample this'll be the most important one\n\n347\n00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.990\nfor you because you might\nonly have a gigabit adapter.\n\n348\n00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:12.070\nAnd you're consuming all of that\nbandwidth so you need to upgrade and\n\n349\n00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:13.782\ngo to something stronger and faster.\n\n350\n00:17:13.782 --> 00:17:16.229\nMaybe you're on a 100 megabit network or\neven a wireless network and\n\n351\n00:17:16.229 --> 00:17:19.120\nyou're not getting the performance\nout of it that you're expecting.\n\n352\n00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.350\nThis is where you go to find that out.\n\n353\n00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:23.130\nAnd this is slowly trended over time.\n\n354\n00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.080\nRemember you still have your Activity\nMonitor where you can see it in real time.\n\n355\n00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.460\nSo if you wanna see it right now just as\nit is, go to the Activity Monitor, but\n\n356\n00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.040\nif you wanna trend,\nyou can see it right here.\n\n357\n00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.537\n>> Don, you know, I know that you\nare a UNIX administrator as well.\n\n358\n00:17:35.537 --> 00:17:39.590\nAnd I know you'll say, well wait a second\nWes we're talking about OS 10 server.\n\n359\n00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.106\nWhat does that have to do with anything?\n\n360\n00:17:41.106 --> 00:17:45.260\nWell we have said many times over\nthat the driving engine is BST.\n\n361\n00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.050\nWould you ever use TOP\nat all by any means?\n\n362\n00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:49.210\n>> You can.\n\n363\n00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:52.590\nA lot of times we have GUI utilities that\nsave us from having to do stuff like that.\n\n364\n00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.570\nSo if I go into the Activity Monitor,\nright?\n\n365\n00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:56.920\nI can jump into my Activity Monitor.\n\n366\n00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.850\nAnd right here I get a list of processes.\n\n367\n00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.180\nAnd I can sort by CPU\nto see who's consuming.\n\n368\n00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:05.680\nSo Spotlight right now is consuming\nthe most at 8% CPU, right?\n\n369\n00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.120\nAnd now Activity Monitor\nis up there at 2.9.\n\n370\n00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.370\nI can monitor that.\n\n371\n00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:12.940\nYou can do it from the shell and\nyou can even do it remotely if you SSH in.\n\n372\n00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.376\nSo from the shell you cold\nrun something like Top.\n\n373\n00:18:16.376 --> 00:18:22.340\nSo if I just run the Top command and right\nthere I get processes that are using CPU.\n\n374\n00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:26.540\nAnd so it's gonna monitor that and\nthe sort order is wrong so\n\n375\n00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.400\nI probably have to sort that.\n\n376\n00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.550\nWhoops.\n[LAUGH] Let me cancel out.\n\n377\n00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:34.700\nIf you sort it by CPU,\nactually I don't remember.\n\n378\n00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.608\nWhat is the, there we go.\n\n379\n00:18:37.608 --> 00:18:40.419\nSo now I've got it sorted\nwhere CPU is at the top.\n\n380\n00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:43.443\nSo I can see the top command\nis consuming the most CPU, but\n\n381\n00:18:43.443 --> 00:18:46.470\nif I start running other things,\nif I quit out of Safari.\n\n382\n00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:52.310\nAnd then maybe like I launch Safari again,\nwe'll see those start to pop back up and\n\n383\n00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:56.270\nit kind of happened pretty fast there but\nthere's Safari right there.\n\n384\n00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.820\nShoot.\n\n385\n00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:57.350\nThere's Safari.\n\n386\n00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.660\nSo it jumped up on the screen and\nso I can monitor it.\n\n387\n00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.660\nYou always have your command\nline utilities that are there.\n\n388\n00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.570\nThere's ntop, which I don't think\nwe have ntop by default do we?\n\n389\n00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.470\nYeah, that was the top but\nfor network bandwidth.\n\n390\n00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.790\nYou can install it if you want it.\n\n391\n00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:11.840\nThere's a few other ones that you can use.\n\n392\n00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.920\nThere's even simple utilities.\n\n393\n00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.110\nWhat's the memory one?\n\n394\n00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.750\nIs it free?\n\n395\n00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:18.900\nShoot, what is the memory?\n\n396\n00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.210\nWell there's one for memory also.\n\n397\n00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:23.100\nI can't remember the command line for it,\nto view how much memory you've got and\n\n398\n00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.070\nwhat's being consumed.\n\n399\n00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.590\nSame thing with disk storage,\nyou've got good old df,\n\n400\n00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:30.180\nwhich I usually do df-h to\nmake it human readable.\n\n401\n00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.200\nAnd so you can see how much\ndisk space you've got.\n\n402\n00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.950\nA lot of this stuff can be monitored\nfrom the command line if you need it.\n\n403\n00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:39.630\nA lot of this can be monitored\nfrom the GUI though, right?\n\n404\n00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.660\nThe stats screen, the activity monitor,\n\n405\n00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.220\nthey show us the same data,\neffectively, just through a GUI.\n\n406\n00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.973\nI guess storage,\nI didn't really do storage, did I?\n\n407\n00:19:46.973 --> 00:19:51.700\nIf I go back to the Server app,\nin the command line I use df dash h.\n\n408\n00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.060\nIt showed me all my drives and\ntheir storage.\n\n409\n00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.760\nIn the Server app,\nI might have shown it in another show.\n\n410\n00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.950\nBut if you go up to the Server name,\nyou've got a Storage tab right here.\n\n411\n00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:04.550\nAnd when you go into the Storage tab,\nyou see your hard drives and\n\n412\n00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:07.140\nyou see how much space they have\navailable, a nice little GUI.\n\n413\n00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.331\nJust like the df dash h command,\nhere, it's in the GUI.\n\n414\n00:20:10.331 --> 00:20:14.046\nI can even expand it out and\nbrowse around, you can't do that in df.\n\n415\n00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:17.890\nAnd so you can browse through and\nstart to look at what files are where.\n\n416\n00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.710\nAnd get an idea of what's going on there.\n\n417\n00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:23.180\nYou can even manipulate\nsome things like sharing.\n\n418\n00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:27.060\nSo down here you'll see edit permissions,\npropagate permissions, and\n\n419\n00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.370\neven change that view to make it\na little easier to navigate through.\n\n420\n00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:31.930\nYou just lose your sizes based on that.\n\n421\n00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:35.080\nSo, this little storage\nscreen is pretty handy for\n\n422\n00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.020\ntracking what all you've used and\nwhat all is available.\n\n423\n00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:41.573\nSo just another kind of resource that's\navailable for monitoring that server.\n\n424\n00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:47.560\nAll right, so we talked about the log\nscreen which is pretty important.\n\n425\n00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.320\nWe talked about the stats screen and\nnow the storage screen.\n\n426\n00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.620\nThe other one I wanna talk\nabout is the alert screen.\n\n427\n00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.410\nAnd you might notice on mine, some of you\nguys have probably seen this already,\n\n428\n00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:01.440\nis that under my server I've got Alerts\nand I've got two alerts on my system.\n\n429\n00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.131\nWhat it does mean?\n\n430\n00:21:02.131 --> 00:21:06.584\n[LAUGH] Well, it means two things happened\nin the background that I probably need to\n\n431\n00:21:06.584 --> 00:21:08.092\npay attention too, okay?\n\n432\n00:21:08.092 --> 00:21:11.440\nBut I didn't know that because was\npaying attention, so now I know,\n\n433\n00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.530\nI see this little warning here, I've got\ntwo alerts so I need to deal with that.\n\n434\n00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.050\nSo if I click on it I\ncan see what I've got.\n\n435\n00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:20.850\nAnd right off the bat I see this error,\nCaching service out of disk space.\n\n436\n00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.080\nRemember I tried to turn on the caching\nservice a few minutes ago, and\n\n437\n00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.790\nit told me I didn't\nhave enough disk space.\n\n438\n00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.230\nWell, you need a certain amount\nof disk space available.\n\n439\n00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:30.730\nAnd normally I add an extra hard drive for\nit, and I didn't do that.\n\n440\n00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.820\nSo it didn't have a hard drive big enough,\nand it wouldn't let me turn it on.\n\n441\n00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.650\nSo I had a failure.\n\n442\n00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.370\nDo I care about that?\n\n443\n00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.310\nNot in this case,\nI was just trying to turn it on.\n\n444\n00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:42.420\nBut in real life land if I really\nwanted a caching server up,\n\n445\n00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.710\nI need to deal with that.\n\n446\n00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:47.256\nMaybe I already had a caching server up,\nit's been up for 10 months and\n\n447\n00:21:47.256 --> 00:21:50.061\nnow I get an alert telling me\ncaching disk is out of space.\n\n448\n00:21:50.061 --> 00:21:53.474\nI need to provide more space if\nI want to keep caching files.\n\n449\n00:21:53.474 --> 00:21:56.643\nAll right, so this is kind of a warning,\nI need to take some kind of action.\n\n450\n00:21:56.643 --> 00:21:57.546\n>> With this setting Don,\n\n451\n00:21:57.546 --> 00:22:00.310\nit seems like you would have to be in\nthe physical location of the server.\n\n452\n00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:02.380\nOr in case of remote management scenario,\n\n453\n00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.540\nyou would have to at least\nbe in front of this console.\n\n454\n00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.740\nNow is there a way that I can make\nmyself aware of this when I'm\n\n455\n00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.450\nnot looking at these allegations?\n\n456\n00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:13.370\n>> Well you know, I'm the perfect example,\nI didn't even notice that error, right?\n\n457\n00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:14.080\nJust like Wes said,\n\n458\n00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.190\nyou've got to be in the server app to\nsee it, that's why those alerts exist.\n\n459\n00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.930\nSo if I don't launch the server app,\nor if I do launch the server app but\n\n460\n00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:23.157\nI connect to a different server, I'm not\neven going to know this alert happened.\n\n461\n00:22:23.157 --> 00:22:25.713\nSo I have to go in to the server app and\n\n462\n00:22:25.713 --> 00:22:29.380\npay enough attention to\nsee the alert bell is lit.\n\n463\n00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.280\nOtherwise I'm not even\ngonna realize it's there,\n\n464\n00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.890\nI'm just not even gonna think about it.\n\n465\n00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:35.330\nOkay, well, you sort of do see it,\n\n466\n00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:39.490\nif you notice I always pin\nthe server app to the dock.\n\n467\n00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:42.810\nAnd if you look down at the dock, I\nactually did have a little red two there,\n\n468\n00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:44.521\nso I probably should have noticed it.\n\n469\n00:22:44.521 --> 00:22:48.141\nAnd if I was paying attention to my\nnotifications, well they usually makes it\n\n470\n00:22:48.141 --> 00:22:51.778\ninto here, actually, it looks like it\ndidn't make it into here on this one.\n\n471\n00:22:51.778 --> 00:22:54.371\nSo it'll usually make it into you're\nnotifications too, but I'll tell you,\n\n472\n00:22:54.371 --> 00:22:56.690\nI'm just really bad about\nchecking on that stuff, right?\n\n473\n00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:02.540\nSo what I recommend is set it up to email\nyou and you'll see an email, right?\n\n474\n00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:07.020\nAnd in the alert screen if\nyou go the Delivery tab\n\n475\n00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:10.540\nright here you can configure\nhow its gonna notify you.\n\n476\n00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.265\nAnd we can set it up to Email Recipients.\n\n477\n00:23:13.265 --> 00:23:19.040\nSo I can edit that and\nI can add in don@itpro.tv, okay?\n\n478\n00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.880\nSo I'm gonna add that one in.\n\n479\n00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.150\nAnd now when an alert gets generated,\nit's gonna send me an email so\n\n480\n00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.620\nthat I'll know that that happened.\n\n481\n00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.970\nAnd now I didn't have to\nbe in the server app.\n\n482\n00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:29.750\nI didn't have to go to the server.\n\n483\n00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:33.140\nIt'll shoot me an email for\neverything except a network failure.\n\n484\n00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.450\nKinda has a hard time emailing\nyou if the network fails, right?\n\n485\n00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:36.090\nSo be aware of that.\n\n486\n00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:39.020\nBut you'll probably notice that there's\na problem with the server because it's no\n\n487\n00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.130\nlonger reachable, right?\n\n488\n00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.790\nSo that's kind of got its own\nway to organize itself out.\n\n489\n00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:44.970\nThere's also push notifications.\n\n490\n00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:48.103\nIf I I'm logged in with my\nApple ID on a server, and\n\n491\n00:23:48.103 --> 00:23:52.445\nI'm logged in with the same Apple ID\non my phone or tablet or desktop.\n\n492\n00:23:52.445 --> 00:23:58.331\nI can enable push notifications and it'll\nsend me a notification through Apple.\n\n493\n00:23:58.331 --> 00:24:01.338\nI just need to log in with\nmy Apple ID right here.\n\n494\n00:24:01.338 --> 00:24:04.880\nSo I can punch in whatever\nthat ID happens to be.\n\n495\n00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.400\nAnd whatever that password happens to be.\n\n496\n00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.100\nI know I screwed this up\nin the other episode,\n\n497\n00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:13.100\nlet's see if I can get it\nright the first time here.\n\n498\n00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.920\nAnd what it's gonna do it's\ngonna reach out to Apple and\n\n499\n00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.880\nget a push notification certificate,\na trusted certificate from Apple.\n\n500\n00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.710\nSo there we go, it's got one.\n\n501\n00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:25.850\nAnd now that it's got it, this server\nis gonna start phoning home to Apple.\n\n502\n00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.310\nAnd my other devices will receive\na push notification when it happens.\n\n503\n00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:32.960\nIn fact, I just got a push notification\non my Apple watch right there.\n\n504\n00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.730\nSo letting me know that the server\nhas two alerts sitting on it,\n\n505\n00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.560\nactually it's letting me know that\nI turned on push notifications.\n\n506\n00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.750\nNow push notification can get a little\nexcessive and so over here were you'll\n\n507\n00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:46.040\nsee where I can configure what's\nan email and what's a push.\n\n508\n00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.030\nAnd you can turn those on and off,\nso the cashing server counter and\n\n509\n00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.090\ncontacts and so on.\n\n510\n00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:53.190\nThere might be some things that\nI just don't care about, right?\n\n511\n00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:55.060\nSo I might choose to turn those off and\n\n512\n00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.210\nyou can tweak them and\nyou can send a test alert.\n\n513\n00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:01.890\nSo I can fire off a test alert real\nquick and it's gonna send an email and\n\n514\n00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:06.300\ndo a push notification to me, so I'll get\nthose notifications if I'm logged in and\n\n515\n00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.840\nI'll see that it's working.\n\n516\n00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.530\nSo that's an important thing if\nyou want to be aware of the alert.\n\n517\n00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:13.800\nI can also generate an alert but,\nI just got one here.\n\n518\n00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.100\nI got my, says, Dear Don Pezet,\n\n519\n00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:20.150\nthe following Apple push\nnotification certificate is working.\n\n520\n00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:21.540\nSo I got my notice.\n\n521\n00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:22.640\nIt is working.\n\n522\n00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.960\nAnd now I can rest assured.\n\n523\n00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.650\nI can kick back and\nwatch TV and know that,\n\n524\n00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.550\nif an alert happens, I don't have\nto be in the server app to see it.\n\n525\n00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.940\nI'm going to get that notification and\nI can take action.\n\n526\n00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.200\n>> Well, that's good information.\n\n527\n00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.321\nWhen the dock isn't obvious enough,\n\n528\n00:25:35.321 --> 00:25:39.902\nat least we're putting Don's Apple watch\nto use with those push notifications.\n\n529\n00:25:39.902 --> 00:25:40.952\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well Don,\n\n530\n00:25:40.952 --> 00:25:44.840\nit does look like we're creeping\nup on the end of an episode here.\n\n531\n00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.300\nDo you have any additional words that\nyou'd like to let us know about?\n\n532\n00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.850\n>> All right, so some key things\nhere to remember, the alerts for\n\n533\n00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:53.310\nthe most part,\nare already set up for you, right?\n\n534\n00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:56.320\nI didn't have to configure alerts,\nI just had to go to the screen.\n\n535\n00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.120\nBut, the alerts will sit\nthere pretty much forever, so\n\n536\n00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.720\nlet me show you what to\ndo once you get an alert.\n\n537\n00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.920\nSo when I go to my alerts screen here,\nI've got three alerts, now.\n\n538\n00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.860\nI've got my test alert, I've got\nthe caching service out of disk space,\n\n539\n00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.660\nand I've got two software\nupdates available, right?\n\n540\n00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.290\nSo I need to do some updates.\n\n541\n00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:15.370\nWell, if I go and fix the caching\nservice or I fix my test alert.\n\n542\n00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:17.820\nI don't have to fix a test alert,\nit's just a test?\n\n543\n00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:18.430\nRight?\n\n544\n00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:21.610\nBut it's gonna sit here and\nit's gonna keep that alert bubble lit.\n\n545\n00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:25.220\nSo right down here under the gear,\nyou'll see where you can delete\n\n546\n00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.990\nan individual alert or\nyou can clear all of your alerts.\n\n547\n00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.800\nOkay?\n\n548\n00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.060\nAnd so I can wipe it out, and\nthat's what you should do.\n\n549\n00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.840\nOnce you have solved the problem,\nall right?\n\n550\n00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.050\nSo I've solved this test alert.\n\n551\n00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:39.120\nSo I need to select it and\nhit that gear, and\n\n552\n00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.980\nhit delete alert, so it goes away, right?\n\n553\n00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.540\nOtherwise it is going to keep\nthat bubble lit forever.\n\n554\n00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:48.490\nThe caching service, I know I didn't\nturn it on, so I can just go in and\n\n555\n00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:49.510\ndelete that out.\n\n556\n00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:52.750\nIf you double click on the alert,\nyou get more information and\n\n557\n00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:55.390\nso, here it's telling me the caching\nservice is out of disk space.\n\n558\n00:26:55.390 --> 00:27:00.090\nThe cache will not use\nthe remaining 25 GB of disk space.\n\n559\n00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:05.070\nI need something with more than 25 GB of\nspace available, that's why it crashed.\n\n560\n00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:09.490\nSo now I know that it crashed and\nwhat I need to do to fix it, right?\n\n561\n00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:13.040\nIf I don't introduce more than 25 GB,\nit's just gonna crash again.\n\n562\n00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.990\nAnd I've got these two little\narrows down here where I can move\n\n563\n00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:20.920\nforward to the next alert,\nthe next alert were the software updates.\n\n564\n00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.860\nI've got two software updates available,\none for a digital camera,\n\n565\n00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:29.378\nbetter rush on that one, but\nthe other one, OS 10 El Capitan 10.11.4.\n\n566\n00:27:29.378 --> 00:27:30.390\nI'm running 10.11.3.\n\n567\n00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:32.480\nI probably need to do an update.\n\n568\n00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.050\nI bet there's some security updates rolled\ninto that one, I need to go find out.\n\n569\n00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.350\nResearch the update, find out if\nyou need it and then deploy it.\n\n570\n00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:43.060\nBut once you do the update,\nyou need to come in and clear these and so\n\n571\n00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:49.020\nI'm gonna clear all the alerts and now the\nlittle bubble goes away on my server icon.\n\n572\n00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.680\nAnd now we're free and clear.\n\n573\n00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:54.300\nBut if I try and start that caching\nservice again, I'm gonna start it.\n\n574\n00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.140\nIt's just gonna crash again.\n\n575\n00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.110\nDoesn't have enough space.\n\n576\n00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:57.390\nThere it goes.\nCrashes, right?\n\n577\n00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:58.240\nIt's not really crashing.\n\n578\n00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.180\nIt's exiting cleanly.\n\n579\n00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.990\nIt just doesn't have enough space.\n\n580\n00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:05.070\nAnd in a few moments,\nthe alert will come up.\n\n581\n00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:08.580\nNow, it's kinda funny because I\njust got the alert on my watch.\n\n582\n00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:12.180\nI got the alert before it showed\nup here in the server app.\n\n583\n00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.320\nWhy is that?\n\n584\n00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:19.015\nWell, little unknown fact, but the server\napp, it doesn't refresh itself, ever.\n\n585\n00:28:19.015 --> 00:28:22.440\n[LAUGH] It's really up\nto you to refresh it.\n\n586\n00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:26.280\nNormally when you move between apps,\nthat causes a refresh.\n\n587\n00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.980\nBut if I just sitting here,\nstaring at the screen.\n\n588\n00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.140\nIt doesn't refresh.\n\n589\n00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.180\nSo you can refresh it manually.\n\n590\n00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.190\nIt's buried up here in the menu somewhere,\nview I think?\n\n591\n00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:36.590\nYeah, you can do view and refresh.\n\n592\n00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:38.090\nOr you can do Cmd+R.\n\n593\n00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:40.270\nAnd if I do a Cmd+ R,\nthat'll cause a refresh, and\n\n594\n00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:41.310\nnormally it'll find the alert.\n\n595\n00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:42.200\nIt didn't.\n\n596\n00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.829\nIs this ever gonna refresh?\n\n597\n00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:47.060\nAll right,\nwell apparently it's not gonna refresh.\n\n598\n00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:50.160\nBut I did get my letter via email and\nI got my push notification,\n\n599\n00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.180\nit's going off again.\n\n600\n00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.160\nSo I'm getting those alerts.\n\n601\n00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.660\nJust be aware that the screen\ndoesn't refresh, or\n\n602\n00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:58.330\nat least it doesn't refresh very well.\n\n603\n00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:01.670\nYou can force it if I just exit\nthe server app, and go back into it.\n\n604\n00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.970\nEventually it will get it, but\nobviously that's not very timely, right?\n\n605\n00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:08.920\nSo that's another example of why we\nwould wanna set up those pushes so\n\n606\n00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.980\nthat we get those alert messages.\n\n607\n00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.910\nBecause I'm still not getting\nthat stinking alert in here.\n\n608\n00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:16.330\nThat's a problem, right?\n\n609\n00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:17.520\nYou don't wanna rely on this.\n\n610\n00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.280\nIt's too easy to overlook, and it's slow.\n\n611\n00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.680\nSet up email, set up the push alerts,\n\n612\n00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.670\nand when you're done with an alert,\nmake sure you clear it out.\n\n613\n00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:28.300\nIf it ever shows up on this dumb thing.\n\n614\n00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:31.120\nThen make sure you clear it out,\notherwise the alert stays there.\n\n615\n00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:31.970\nIt stays there forever, and\n\n616\n00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:34.978\nyou can get more than one person working\non the problem, you've already handled it,\n\n617\n00:29:34.978 --> 00:29:36.190\nwipe it out.\n\n618\n00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:40.110\n>> Great information, and now we get\nto go clear out notifications for\n\n619\n00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:44.540\nabout 50 of the different devices that\nare scattered through the ITProTV studios.\n\n620\n00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.660\nBut until we get that done,\n\n621\n00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.830\nit does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n622\n00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:52.740\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ntake this time to sign out for ITProTV.\n\n623\n00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.040\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n624\n00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.023\n>> And I'm Don Pizzet.\n\n625\n00:29:55.023 --> 00:29:56.819\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n626\n00:29:56.819 --> 00:29:58.957\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.556\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:20.401\nin today's episode we're gonna be moving\nalong in our OS X Server Essentials.\n\n5\n00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:23.210\nAnd we got none other than Mr.\nDon Pezet on hand to help us out.\n\n6\n00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.220\nDon, how you doing sir?\n\n7\n00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.090\n>> I am doing great Wes, ready to jump\nright back into the world of OS X Server,\n\n8\n00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.510\nand in this episode, we're gonna\ntake a look at server maintenance.\n\n9\n00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.520\nOnce you get your server up and running,\nyou guys have seen the earlier episodes,\n\n10\n00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.610\nit's really not that hard.\n\n11\n00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.850\nGet the server app in place,\nand turn on a few services.\n\n12\n00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.590\nOnce that's done it starts to run.\n\n13\n00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.500\nAnd hopefully things just run great,\nand for\n\n14\n00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.350\nthe most part,\nyou can kind of forget about it.\n\n15\n00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.640\nYou just set the server up, and\nyou walk away, and now it does it's thing.\n\n16\n00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.520\nBut from time to time, we do need to step\nin and take a few kind of maintenance\n\n17\n00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.220\nactivities, just to make sure that our\nserver stay safe, secure, and intact.\n\n18\n00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.190\nIf we ever had a hardware failure,\nor a compromise,\n\n19\n00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.960\na virus, something like that, we need\nto be able to recover from that, and\n\n20\n00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.630\nmake sure that our system stays intact.\n\n21\n00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.863\nAnd so these are the maintenance\nactivities that we need to be performing.\n\n22\n00:01:09.863 --> 00:01:13.444\nA lot of people don't do these, a lot of\npeople kind of shirk the maintenance side\n\n23\n00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:16.740\nand say, well it's an Apple product,\nyou just turn it on and it'll run.\n\n24\n00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.190\nAnd that's true, it'll run just fine,\nright up until the part where it doesn't.\n\n25\n00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.480\nAnd that's when you need to have\nthat maintenance in place and\n\n26\n00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.300\nit doesn't matter how much effort Apple\nputs into OS X, hard drives fail.\n\n27\n00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.060\nApple doesn't make hard drives, right.\n\n28\n00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.470\nSo you have hard drive failures,\nyou've got to be prepared for that.\n\n29\n00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.150\nYou have things like security exploits and\nvulnerabilities that come out.\n\n30\n00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.237\nApple patches those,\nthey do a great job of patching them,\n\n31\n00:01:40.237 --> 00:01:43.898\nbut do you do a great job about\nupdating and installing those patches?\n\n32\n00:01:43.898 --> 00:01:44.965\nA lot of people don't.\n\n33\n00:01:44.965 --> 00:01:48.777\nSo as a system's administrator, as\nsomebody who's administering OS X servers\n\n34\n00:01:48.777 --> 00:01:52.149\nin the workplace, you need to be\nmaking sure you update these systems.\n\n35\n00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.186\nAnd so that's what we're gonna to\ntake a look here in this episode,\n\n36\n00:01:55.186 --> 00:01:56.212\nupdates and backups.\n\n37\n00:01:56.212 --> 00:01:58.952\nAll right,\nwell let's kick things off with updates.\n\n38\n00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.956\nI wanna start with updates because\nthey are so important, and they're so\n\n39\n00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:03.360\neasy to overlook.\n\n40\n00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.870\nWhen you install Mac OS X, right,\nwhen you get El Capitan fired up for\n\n41\n00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:15.148\nthe first time, automatic updates\nare sort of enabled, sort of not enabled.\n\n42\n00:02:15.148 --> 00:02:16.913\nAll right,\nnow what the heck do I mean by that?\n\n43\n00:02:16.913 --> 00:02:17.771\nWell, let me show you here.\n\n44\n00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:19.965\nSo, I've got this server.\n\n45\n00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:23.920\nThis is a stock install of El Capitan.\n\n46\n00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.900\nAnd all I've done is change my wallpaper\nand removed some stuff from the dock down\n\n47\n00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.350\nhere, and I installed the server app,\nand that's about it, okay.\n\n48\n00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.233\nWell, when I installed this,\nit's running El Capitan 10.11.3.\n\n49\n00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:41.613\nI know 10.11.4 is out okay, I know\nit's out, it's been out for weeks now,\n\n50\n00:02:41.613 --> 00:02:44.190\nthis system doesn't have it.\n\n51\n00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.240\nWell, doesn't the system\nautomatically upgrade?\n\n52\n00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.630\nNo, no it doesn't.\n\n53\n00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.890\nIt's prompted me a few times, but\nbecause of the show I just ignored it.\n\n54\n00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.160\nNot now, or maybe later.\n\n55\n00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.760\nRight, a lot of people do that,\nlike I'll come back and I'll do it later.\n\n56\n00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.970\nAnd then what do we do?\n\n57\n00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:58.894\nWe don't come back and do it later right?\n\n58\n00:02:58.894 --> 00:03:01.750\n[LAUGH] It just kind of gets forgotten and\nput by the wayside.\n\n59\n00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.649\nSo at this stage, the only even hint\nthat there's an update out there\n\n60\n00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:11.640\nis right in the server app under Alerts,\nI've got an alert.\n\n61\n00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.230\nAnd if I look at that alert,\n\n62\n00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.320\nit's altering me that there's two\nsoftware updates available, okay.\n\n63\n00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.258\nOne of those is gonna be the 10.11.4\nupdate, cuz I know that's out there.\n\n64\n00:03:21.258 --> 00:03:23.522\nActually don't know what the other one is,\nlet's find out.\n\n65\n00:03:23.522 --> 00:03:26.131\nSo if I double-click on that\nit'll tell me what we've got and\n\n66\n00:03:26.131 --> 00:03:29.178\nyou know we saw this in the show the other\nday, I should have remembered that.\n\n67\n00:03:29.178 --> 00:03:33.351\nThat there is the 10.11.4, but there's\nalso some kind of digital camera update,,\n\n68\n00:03:33.351 --> 00:03:35.770\nbecause I'm a laptop and\nI've got a digital camera.\n\n69\n00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.580\nSo, it's got an update for that.\n\n70\n00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.155\nI don't necessarily care about the camera\nupdate, that's probably not gonna help me,\n\n71\n00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:44.907\nbut 10.11.4,\nI probably do care about that.\n\n72\n00:03:44.907 --> 00:03:46.939\nI probably wanna learn a little\nmore about that update.\n\n73\n00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:48.738\nI can get it rolled out my environment.\n\n74\n00:03:48.738 --> 00:03:53.093\n>> Don, you had showed us in a previous\nepisode that sometimes when we do updates,\n\n75\n00:03:53.093 --> 00:03:56.996\nwe've got our base operating system and\nwe have the server app itself.\n\n76\n00:03:56.996 --> 00:03:58.611\nSo are we looking at a single update,\n\n77\n00:03:58.611 --> 00:04:01.384\nare we looking at maybe a couple\nof different types of updates?\n\n78\n00:04:01.384 --> 00:04:05.218\n>> It's really a couple of different ones,\nand that base OS part is important because\n\n79\n00:04:05.218 --> 00:04:09.075\nthese updates that it's showing here,\nthose weren't updates to the server app.\n\n80\n00:04:09.075 --> 00:04:12.380\nThose are updates to the OS,\nnot the server app, right.\n\n81\n00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.770\nAnd so they're showing up in the server\napp because I've got it installed, but\n\n82\n00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.180\neven if I didn't have\nthe server app installed,\n\n83\n00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.090\nthose updates would still be available and\nneeded for my system.\n\n84\n00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.180\nIf you go into your System Preferences and\nin your System Preferences,\n\n85\n00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.780\nyou can go into\nthe App Store System Panel, right?\n\n86\n00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.699\nSo this Preference panel right here.\n\n87\n00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.933\nAnd I know this seems weird\nto go to App Store, but\n\n88\n00:04:32.933 --> 00:04:35.560\nall the Apple updates roll out\nthrough the App Store now.\n\n89\n00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.640\nThat's the way they handle that.\n\n90\n00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.050\nAnd when you go into the App Store,\n\n91\n00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.710\nyou'll see how your automatic\nsettings are configured.\n\n92\n00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.220\nAnd this is kinda the default, that we're\nset to automatically check for updates.\n\n93\n00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.780\nIt will look to see if\nan update is out there.\n\n94\n00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.560\nIt'll download the update\nin the background.\n\n95\n00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.650\nSo when an update comes out, it's\nactually gonna download it from Apple and\n\n96\n00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.170\nput it on your hard drive.\n\n97\n00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.606\nIt will install app updates, so if you\nhave Safari, it needs an update, or if\n\n98\n00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:05.732\nPages, one of those other programs needs\nan update, it'll go ahead and update that.\n\n99\n00:05:05.732 --> 00:05:06.939\nBut look at this guy.\n\n100\n00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.780\nInstall OS X updates, it's not checked.\n\n101\n00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.558\nIt will download the OS X updates,\nbut it won't install it automatically.\n\n102\n00:05:14.558 --> 00:05:16.510\nThat means that if I don't come here and\n\n103\n00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.850\ndo the updates myself,\nthe server is never gonna get updated.\n\n104\n00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.436\nAnd a year from now,\nit will still be running 10.11.3.\n\n105\n00:05:23.436 --> 00:05:25.906\nEven though 10.11.4 has\nbeen downloaded and\n\n106\n00:05:25.906 --> 00:05:29.060\nsitting right there onto the hard drive,\nit doesn't install it.\n\n107\n00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.810\nNow, you might be tempted to go ahead and\ncheck that.\n\n108\n00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.450\nAnd I'll tell you be careful with that,\nbecause you don't necessarily want\n\n109\n00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.890\nto automatically roll\nout updates to a server.\n\n110\n00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.750\nTo a workstation is one thing, right?\n\n111\n00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.110\nIf my laptop takes an update and\nhas to reboot, it bothers me.\n\n112\n00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.053\nWhat about everybody else in the company?\n\n113\n00:05:46.053 --> 00:05:46.797\nIt doesn't bother them.\n\n114\n00:05:46.797 --> 00:05:48.240\nRight, it's my laptop, it's my problem.\n\n115\n00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.490\nSo it doesn't affect them,\nit's just my system.\n\n116\n00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.870\nBut on a server, let's say it's an open\ndirectory server, it goes to reboot and\n\n117\n00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.720\nnow nobody can log in on the network.\n\n118\n00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.380\nNow my entire company is inconvenienced\nwhile that server reboots.\n\n119\n00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.630\nAnd what if the update breaks something?\n\n120\n00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.170\nWhat if I've got educational\nsoftware running on that server and\n\n121\n00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.130\nthe update applies,\nnow the software doesn't run.\n\n122\n00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.940\nNow all the students can't\nget into that software.\n\n123\n00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.318\nThat's a problem.\n\n124\n00:06:12.318 --> 00:06:15.750\nServers, we wanna get much more involved\nin the update process than we do on\n\n125\n00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.960\nworkstations.\n\n126\n00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.400\nAnd so the recommendation is to\nnot use Apple's update service.\n\n127\n00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.550\nWith Apple's update service, they wanna\nroll you updates as fast as they can.\n\n128\n00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.132\nAs soon as they come out, they wanna\nget it to you and get it installed.\n\n129\n00:06:28.132 --> 00:06:31.965\nRight, but instead,\nyou should setup your own update server.\n\n130\n00:06:31.965 --> 00:06:34.299\nAnd setting up your own update\nserver's really pretty easy.\n\n131\n00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:35.366\nLet me walk you through the process.\n\n132\n00:06:35.366 --> 00:06:38.480\nI know at this point you guys\nshould have completed ACA Shows and\n\n133\n00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.960\nwe covered it in there\nin integrator depth.\n\n134\n00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.860\nBut just to run through it quickly here.\n\n135\n00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.630\nYou can set up your own\nsoftware update server.\n\n136\n00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.185\nAnd what will happen is you'll\ndownload the updates from Apple and\n\n137\n00:06:48.185 --> 00:06:49.526\nthen you'll hold them.\n\n138\n00:06:49.526 --> 00:06:54.426\nAnd then you can choose what updates to\napprove and what updates not to approve.\n\n139\n00:06:54.426 --> 00:06:58.271\nAnd so, you might roll some updates out to\na couple of test servers to make sure that\n\n140\n00:06:58.271 --> 00:06:59.510\nthings work.\n\n141\n00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.316\nAnd then roll it out to the rest of\nyour servers, but you need that control.\n\n142\n00:07:02.316 --> 00:07:05.057\nYou don't get that control when\nyou're using Apple's update servers.\n\n143\n00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:06.682\nThey just roll everything out to you.\n\n144\n00:07:06.682 --> 00:07:09.140\nIf you want control, you've got\nto set up your own update server.\n\n145\n00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.684\n>> Now Don, you said don't\nautomatically install these updates.\n\n146\n00:07:12.684 --> 00:07:14.965\nI'd forget my head if it wasn't attached,\nso\n\n147\n00:07:14.965 --> 00:07:18.941\nwould you advise maybe having some sort\nof patch management system or solution,\n\n148\n00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:22.880\nwhere these things can be reviewed,\nthey can be submitted and approved?\n\n149\n00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.655\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n150\n00:07:23.655 --> 00:07:26.830\nYou've gotta take an active hand in this,\nso you need a group of people,\n\n151\n00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.410\nyou need a group of test computers that\nyou can roll these updates out to.\n\n152\n00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.800\nDifferent people can test it out and make\nsure all the functionality is still valid,\n\n153\n00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.440\nand if it is,\nthen roll it out to the masses, right?\n\n154\n00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.360\nAnd you can do that with the software\nupdate that were built right into\n\n155\n00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.060\nthe server app, so let me show you that.\n\n156\n00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.574\nSo here I am in the server app and\nI've got my little alerts here.\n\n157\n00:07:43.574 --> 00:07:47.669\nOn the left side if I scroll down and\ngo to the Advanced section,\n\n158\n00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:51.614\nyou'll see there's a service\ncalled Software Update, and\n\n159\n00:07:51.614 --> 00:07:54.653\nwe can create our own\nSoftware Update server.\n\n160\n00:07:54.653 --> 00:07:58.206\nAnd what the Software Update server\ndoes is it downloads the updates\n\n161\n00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:00.089\nfrom Apple Stores them right here.\n\n162\n00:08:00.089 --> 00:08:03.370\nAnd then we can approve or\ndecline them on our own schedule.\n\n163\n00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.900\nWe can pick when they roll out.\n\n164\n00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.210\nAnd once we approve them,\n\n165\n00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.380\nthey'll automatically roll out to\nthe clients that are connected.\n\n166\n00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.410\nSo, I'm gonna go in here and\njust kind of set the Mode.\n\n167\n00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.200\nThe Mode defaults to Automatic, right.\n\n168\n00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.210\nI'm gonna download the updates and\nautomatically roll them out to everybody.\n\n169\n00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.900\nThat's kind of what the Apple\nserver does already.\n\n170\n00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.400\nAll this really does is save me bandwidth.\n\n171\n00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.200\nI download the update once and\nshare it amongst all my clients.\n\n172\n00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.320\nWe normally want manual.\n\n173\n00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.070\nI will manually approve updates.\n\n174\n00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:31.710\nAnd then, under the updates tab\nwe can actually reach out and\n\n175\n00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.740\nget the updates, and we can tell it to\nautomatically download new updates.\n\n176\n00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.280\nI'm not gonna check that, cuz I don't\nhave a ton of hard drive space here on my\n\n177\n00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.900\nlaptop, but on a server you\nhave an extra hard drive, and\n\n178\n00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.850\nyou can download all the updates\nfrom Apple and store them locally.\n\n179\n00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.480\nAnd then down here at the bottom I'm just\ngonna hit this gear, and hit check for\n\n180\n00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.130\nupdates.\n\n181\n00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.430\nSo I'm gonna tell it to reach out to\nApple and download a list of updates.\n\n182\n00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.470\nNow since this is the first time I've\nrun it This is going to take a while.\n\n183\n00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.730\nIt'll take like ten or 15 minutes for\nit to get the full list of dates.\n\n184\n00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:02.330\nIf this is your second or hundredth or\n\n185\n00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.360\nthousandth time running it,\nit happens really fast.\n\n186\n00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.220\nBut the first time, it's got to get\nthis huge database of updates and\n\n187\n00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.490\ndownload it and store it right here.\n\n188\n00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:13.190\nAnd they'll slowly trickle in, sometimes\nyou can hit command R and refresh and\n\n189\n00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.980\neventually you'll see it.\n\n190\n00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.840\nBut other times it's just gonna sit\nhere like this until it gets that first\n\n191\n00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.960\nbig list.\n\n192\n00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.890\n>> So at this point you're basically,\nit's just a waiting game.\n\n193\n00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:23.500\n>> Basically, yeah.\n\n194\n00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.130\nI'm gonna flip the on switch there to turn\non, and I'm gonna redo that check for\n\n195\n00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.220\nupdates just to make sure it's doing it.\n\n196\n00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.440\nIt should already be doing it in\nthe background, and we just wait,\n\n197\n00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.110\nwe let it run.\n\n198\n00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.950\nNow, once it's done I'll\nhave a big list of updates.\n\n199\n00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.030\nAnd on the updates, I'll be able\nto pick each one individually,\n\n200\n00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.530\nand approve it or withhold it.\n\n201\n00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.120\nI can withhold all updates by default.\n\n202\n00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.620\nThat's the default function.\n\n203\n00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.900\nAnd then, when I'm ready,\nwhen I've tested it out and\n\n204\n00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.340\nI know the update is safe,\nthen I can approve it.\n\n205\n00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.290\nAnd it can roll out to all of my servers\nand I can update them all at once.\n\n206\n00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.090\nRight?\nSo it's very convenient But\n\n207\n00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:55.990\nit gives me a way to control it.\n\n208\n00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:00.270\nNow while we're waiting on that there's\nsome other things we can do but basically\n\n209\n00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.180\nat this stage you can kind of wait and\nwell hopefully those updates show up.\n\n210\n00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.300\n>> And this being a centralized process\nDon how would we take like if we've\n\n211\n00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.240\ngot multiple Mac clients within\nour networks how would they know\n\n212\n00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.720\n>> That hey, this server even exists.\n\n213\n00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.670\nAnd I don't want you going\nout to the internet and\n\n214\n00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.500\npulling them down from\nthe app store like we see.\n\n215\n00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.650\n>> All right.\nSo great question because all of\n\n216\n00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.650\nyour clients, all of your servers, they're\ngonna reach out to Apple by default.\n\n217\n00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.370\nThat's the default functionality.\n\n218\n00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.350\nSo we need to point them at\nthis software update server.\n\n219\n00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.810\nAnd you can do it a few different ways.\n\n220\n00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.530\nThe best way is if you have the Apple\nprofile manager That you can use\n\n221\n00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:36.430\nthe profile manager to push out this\nsetting out to all your machines.\n\n222\n00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.190\nBut even if you're not using the profile\nmanager, you can still do it.\n\n223\n00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.370\nYou can do it from the command line,\nand from the command line,\n\n224\n00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.980\nyou can push the commands out via\nthe Apple remote desktop utility also.\n\n225\n00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.910\nSo you can roll this out to thousands of\nmachines all at once, very quickly and\n\n226\n00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:48.930\nvery easily.\n\n227\n00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.910\nThe command,\nlet me just drop to terminal here.\n\n228\n00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.440\nWe have to do it from\nthe terminal because in the GUI,\n\n229\n00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.120\nit just automatically points us to apple.\n\n230\n00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.630\nIt doesn't let us point to anywhere else.\n\n231\n00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.430\nBut if you drop in your terminal,\nthe command is a long one.\n\n232\n00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.480\nWe need to write a preference\nthat doesn't have a GUI element.\n\n233\n00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.780\nSo we're going to have to do it from here.\n\n234\n00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.350\nYou have to be an administrator\nto write to a preference.\n\n235\n00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.660\nSo I'm going to do a sudo so\nI'm going to be an administrator,\n\n236\n00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.200\nand I'm going to say defaults write.\n\n237\n00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.080\nSo I'm updating a preference.\n\n238\n00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.420\nI don't need to tell what\npreference I'm gonna update.\n\n239\n00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.909\nThe one I'm gonna update is\n\n240\n00:11:24.909 --> 00:11:34.639\n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUp-\ndate and\n\n241\n00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:37.530\nthen Actually I can leave off that .plist.\n\n242\n00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.990\nSo you can just specify\nwhat that preference is.\n\n243\n00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:43.370\nAnd then it's the catalogURL.\n\n244\n00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.400\nWhat's a catalog?\n\n245\n00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.520\nWell, a catalog is a database of\nall the updates that are available.\n\n246\n00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.660\nThink of it as like a shopping catalog.\n\n247\n00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.270\nYou can go and shop for updates.\n\n248\n00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:56.590\nSo I might not have Pages installed, so\nI don't care about the Pages updates.\n\n249\n00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.610\nBut if I do have pages installed,\nI want those updates.\n\n250\n00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:00.520\nOr iTunes or iPhoto.\n\n251\n00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.920\nServer App, right?\n\n252\n00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.670\nAll of those are stored right there\nin this update file to say whether or\n\n253\n00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:05.760\nnot they're present.\n\n254\n00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.170\nAnd by default,\nthe catalog url points to Apple.\n\n255\n00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.030\nBut I can change that and\n\n256\n00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:14.780\npoint it to whatever server it is on\nmy network that has that same setup.\n\n257\n00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:21.819\nSo I can point to this server,\nwhich is What is this code server called?\n\n258\n00:12:21.819 --> 00:12:27.660\nIt's osx-server01.local:8088,\nit's just a web server, but\n\n259\n00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:34.240\nit's running on port 8088, so I'm gonna\npoint it to that /index.sucatalog,\n\n260\n00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.360\nall right, it's an index file and\nit's the software update catalog.\n\n261\n00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.680\nSo, by running this command.\n\n262\n00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:46.690\nIt's gonna point me at well myself right\nat my software server and I could run that\n\n263\n00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:50.830\nsame command on all the other computers in\nmy network and once they're all pointed\n\n264\n00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:55.860\nhere now they're gonna get updates from\nthis system okay all right from one place.\n\n265\n00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:00.710\nNow you can always verify that by doing\nlike if you ever wanna see it on your\n\n266\n00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:06.580\nsystem If you change it from\ndefaults write to defaults read then\n\n267\n00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:11.230\nit will read in that file and it will let\nyou know where you pointing to right now.\n\n268\n00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:14.820\nOk, so when I read that file you\ncan see where it is pointing and\n\n269\n00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.830\nif I take a system that didn't have\nthat update like this computer here.\n\n270\n00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.520\nThis is my other client.\n\n271\n00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.550\nAnd if I just go and look at that,\nI can look at it and\n\n272\n00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:28.120\nsee how it says does not exist,\nit's not there.\n\n273\n00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.360\nIt's pointing to Apple.\n\n274\n00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.070\nApple's the default, right.\n\n275\n00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:36.710\nIf you ever undo this you just run sudo\ndefaults delete /Library/preferences blah\n\n276\n00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:40.380\nblah blah and you delete that category URL\nand that puts you back to Apple, right.\n\n277\n00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.330\nBut now I'm looking to this server,\nso for now on when I check to update\n\n278\n00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:48.270\nI'm gonna check against the software\nupdate server running right here.\n\n279\n00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.850\nAnd whoop,\nupdates finally showed up, right?\n\n280\n00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.940\nAnd notice all these updates that\nhave a status of Available, right?\n\n281\n00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.250\nSo here's a status for\nOS X Mavericks Developer Preview 3.\n\n282\n00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.790\nI probably don't wanna role that one out.\n\n283\n00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:02.600\nWe'll sort this by date so\nwe can get ones that are from this decade.\n\n284\n00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.390\nThere we go.\n\n285\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:07.260\nSo, looks like there's some kind of\nboot camp driver update that came out\n\n286\n00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.800\nApril 21st 2016,\nthat's just 5 or 6 days ago.\n\n287\n00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.150\nSo there's an update that came out,\nI don't know if I want to roll that out.\n\n288\n00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.850\nThere's that digital camera\nRAW compatibility update.\n\n289\n00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.740\nI know I'm missing that one.\n\n290\n00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.250\nAnd somewhere in here,\nwe'll find right here.\n\n291\n00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.523\nOS 10 El Capitan update 10.11.4.\n\n292\n00:14:25.523 --> 00:14:27.620\nI'm running 10.11.3, here's point four.\n\n293\n00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.170\nAlright?\nNotice how there's three different\n\n294\n00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:31.260\nversions of it.\n\n295\n00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.760\nWhy are there three different\nversions of this one update?\n\n296\n00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.600\nWell, each one is kind of made for\na different purpose.\n\n297\n00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.160\nNotice this one is 2.89 gigabytes, right?\n\n298\n00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.945\nThat's gonna be for\nsomebody upgrading from Yosemite.\n\n299\n00:14:44.945 --> 00:14:46.500\n1.15 gigs.\n\n300\n00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.510\nThat'll be somebody like me\nwhere I'm already at 10.11.3 and\n\n301\n00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:50.620\nI'm upgrading to 10.11.4.\n\n302\n00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.970\nThese are like variations\nof the same update.\n\n303\n00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.570\nI'm gonna pick a small one though.\n\n304\n00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.150\nI'll do that camera one.\n\n305\n00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.420\nThe camera one is only 7 megs.\n\n306\n00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.560\nI'm gonna click on that and\nsee how I can download it?\n\n307\n00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.070\nAnd I can download and enable.\n\n308\n00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.800\nIf I choose download and enable It's\ngonna download it from Apple and\n\n309\n00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.740\nit's gonna authorize it on this server.\n\n310\n00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.360\nAnybody pointing to this server is\nnow gonna get that update, right.\n\n311\n00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.610\nSo now I just controlled\nwhen that update rolled out.\n\n312\n00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:19.260\nSo I don't have to just blindly roll\nout updates the moment they come out,\n\n313\n00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.010\nI can test them and\nallow them to roll out.\n\n314\n00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:24.000\nBut the key thing to remember\nhere it that I had to do it.\n\n315\n00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.190\nUpdating your servers is part of your job.\n\n316\n00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.320\nThat's part of maintaining these\nsystems and keeping them up and\n\n317\n00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:29.900\nkeeping them healthy.\n\n318\n00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.700\nYou've got to take these steps and\nget that in place.\n\n319\n00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.710\nAll right, as far as updates, basically\nthe moral of the story is do your updates.\n\n320\n00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.140\nDon't forget them.\n\n321\n00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.930\nIf you're not gonna set up a software\nupdate server, if you're not gonna\n\n322\n00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.930\nstay on top of it, then you might as\nwell set it to automatic against Apple.\n\n323\n00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.660\nBecause doing automatic updates is\nbetter than not doing updates at all.\n\n324\n00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.450\nApple pushes a lot of virus fixes out.\n\n325\n00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:54.770\nPeople always say, I love Mac OS\ncuz I don't have to run antivirus.\n\n326\n00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:59.243\nWell, the reason you don't have to run\nantivirus is because Apple patches\n\n327\n00:15:59.243 --> 00:16:01.094\nthe exploits the viruses use.\n\n328\n00:16:01.094 --> 00:16:02.287\nThere are Mac viruses.\n\n329\n00:16:02.287 --> 00:16:03.921\nThere's tons of them, right?\n\n330\n00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:06.237\nWe're just not vulnerable to them\ncuz Apple's already patched them.\n\n331\n00:16:06.237 --> 00:16:10.150\nThey're very good about that,\nif you deploy the updates.\n\n332\n00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:13.020\nBut if you don't deploy the updates,\nthen you're susceptible and\n\n333\n00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.260\nyou're not running antivirus.\n\n334\n00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.740\nAnd so now,\nyou've kind of given up, right?\n\n335\n00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:17.840\nDon't let that happen.\n\n336\n00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.066\nYou gotta make sure you do your updates.\n\n337\n00:16:19.066 --> 00:16:22.680\nAll right, now in addition to updates,\n\n338\n00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:27.080\nthe other major task that we\nneed to perform are backups.\n\n339\n00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.120\nWe need to make sure that we're\nbacking up our servers so\n\n340\n00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.290\nthat we restore them in the event\nof some kind of a failure, right?\n\n341\n00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:37.470\nMaybe I roll out an update, and the update\nbreaks some software package and now,\n\n342\n00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:39.270\nmy server is offline, right?\n\n343\n00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.070\nNow something is not functioning,\nI can't get open directory to run.\n\n344\n00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:43.900\nI need to be able to restore from backup.\n\n345\n00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.270\nWell, you can backup your server using\ntime machine just like any other desktop,\n\n346\n00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:51.210\nbut there's a couple of little\ncaveats we need to be aware of, right?\n\n347\n00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.980\nFirst off,\nlet's just take a look at this server,\n\n348\n00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.870\nso on my server,\nI'm not really running any services, am I?\n\n349\n00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.170\nI got software update running now,\nI guess.\n\n350\n00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.240\nAnd maybe I'll turn on DNS or\na few other things.\n\n351\n00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.430\nMaybe I'll turn on the calendar and mail.\n\n352\n00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:10.520\nSo as I start turning these things on,\nwhat the server is doing is it's creating\n\n353\n00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:15.230\ndirectories in /library/server and\nit's storing the data for these systems.\n\n354\n00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:17.210\nAnd by default,\nthat's on my main hard drive.\n\n355\n00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:20.232\nSo you see up here, I've got Macintosh HD.\n\n356\n00:17:20.232 --> 00:17:25.216\nOkay, if your server has one hard drive,\nthen you can just run time\n\n357\n00:17:25.216 --> 00:17:29.851\nmachine back it up and restore,\nand it's no big deal, okay?\n\n358\n00:17:29.851 --> 00:17:31.750\nIt works really well.\n\n359\n00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.480\nWhere things get a little quirky is\nif we have more than one hard drive.\n\n360\n00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.133\nBut let's start with the single hard drive\nmodel just to kind of see that and then,\n\n361\n00:17:38.133 --> 00:17:39.645\nwe'll go into the multiple\nhard drive model.\n\n362\n00:17:39.645 --> 00:17:44.010\nSo, right now,\nall my data is on Macintosh HD.\n\n363\n00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:47.518\nAnd on my computer, I've got a couple\nof hard drives floating around here.\n\n364\n00:17:47.518 --> 00:17:50.527\nSo, I'm gonna take one of these\nother hard drives that I've got,\n\n365\n00:17:50.527 --> 00:17:52.634\nthis one's 500 gigs, we'll do that one.\n\n366\n00:17:52.634 --> 00:17:55.165\nI'm gonna erase it,\nI'm just gonna call it, Time Machine.\n\n367\n00:17:55.165 --> 00:17:56.580\nYou can call it whatever you want.\n\n368\n00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.689\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n369\n00:17:58.689 --> 00:18:02.720\nPoint is, I'm gonna erase it,\nso I'll have a 500 gig disk.\n\n370\n00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.654\nAnd as soon as that disk is added, the\nsystem asks me, do I want to use it for\n\n371\n00:18:06.654 --> 00:18:08.440\nTime Machine, and I do, right?\n\n372\n00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.290\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nhit use as backup disk, right?\n\n373\n00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:16.120\nNow, when I go to use that as the backup\ndisk, that's going to enable time machine.\n\n374\n00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.721\nAnd so now, I've got time machine enabled,\nit's turned on and\n\n375\n00:18:19.721 --> 00:18:21.934\nit's backing up that 500 gig disk.\n\n376\n00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:26.212\nAnd it's gonna run my first\nbackup in 120 seconds, right?\n\n377\n00:18:26.212 --> 00:18:28.055\nSo it's gonna run shortly.\n\n378\n00:18:28.055 --> 00:18:32.258\nI like to turn this option on right here,\nShow Time Machine in menu bar.\n\n379\n00:18:32.258 --> 00:18:36.549\nBecause that way, I can get a quick\nvisual, know right here whether or\n\n380\n00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:39.562\nnot my last back up ran and\nso on, I kind of see it.\n\n381\n00:18:39.562 --> 00:18:41.388\nI'm gonna tilt it back up\nnow because I'm impatient.\n\n382\n00:18:41.388 --> 00:18:43.216\nSo its gonna start a backup, and\n\n383\n00:18:43.216 --> 00:18:47.292\nI can monitor that progress right\nhere from the time machine menu item.\n\n384\n00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:50.546\nOr I can monitor it from the time\nmachine system preference panel,\n\n385\n00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:51.660\neither way I wanna go.\n\n386\n00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.460\nBut it's gonna run my first back up.\n\n387\n00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.627\nI don't have a ton of data.\n\n388\n00:18:54.627 --> 00:18:57.399\nI've got 11 gigs,\nthis is a fairly clean install.\n\n389\n00:18:57.399 --> 00:19:01.255\nBecause the server is on\nthe same hard drive as my OS,\n\n390\n00:19:01.255 --> 00:19:04.260\nit's gonna back everything up.\n\n391\n00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.791\nAnd if I ever have any problem, right?\n\n392\n00:19:06.791 --> 00:19:10.000\nA server update rolls out and\nit breaks everything, or\n\n393\n00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.649\nI accidentally break the mail service,\nor the chat service.\n\n394\n00:19:13.649 --> 00:19:15.157\nI'll be honest with you guys,\n\n395\n00:19:15.157 --> 00:19:18.530\nI have broken the Messages server\nmore times than any other service.\n\n396\n00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.100\nMore times than all of them combined.\n\n397\n00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.630\nIt is so sensitive.\n\n398\n00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.980\nSo you do like I do, and you break it.\n\n399\n00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:24.930\nOkay.\nWell,\n\n400\n00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.900\nboot to recovery,\nrestore from time machine.\n\n401\n00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.980\nAnd that puts everything back to the way\nthat it was and now you're backed up, and\n\n402\n00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:31.900\nyou're running again.\n\n403\n00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.300\nHaving a time machine backup\nlike this is really valuable.\n\n404\n00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:38.540\n>> Now Don, with time machine being\nactually bait into the operating system\n\n405\n00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.420\nand obviously, Apple's gonna want you\nto get everything from the App Store.\n\n406\n00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.504\nThey're doing quality control on\ntheir applications and software.\n\n407\n00:19:45.504 --> 00:19:47.849\nCan you use anything\nother than Time Machine?\n\n408\n00:19:47.849 --> 00:19:51.428\nCan you use anything, I would say third\nparty but I wouldn't even know how to say\n\n409\n00:19:51.428 --> 00:19:54.280\nthat, because it's gonna come\nfrom the Apple Store anyways.\n\n410\n00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.091\n>> On the exam, no.\n\n411\n00:19:56.091 --> 00:19:58.730\nOn the exam, just use Time Machine.\n\n412\n00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.960\nIn real life, there are tons of\nthird party solutions out there,\n\n413\n00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.910\nmany of which run on Mac OS.\n\n414\n00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:08.000\nI know I use one called ARQ,\nI use it quite a bit.\n\n415\n00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.330\nAnd those work really well for\ndoing full system restores and\n\n416\n00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.479\nmulti drive solutions, it's on a price.\n\n417\n00:20:13.479 --> 00:20:16.470\nI like ARQ because it supports\ncloud services to back up too,\n\n418\n00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.180\nversus time machine where\nit's backing up local.\n\n419\n00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.706\nThe closest thing you can go to a cloud is\nsetting up a network time machine server,\n\n420\n00:20:21.706 --> 00:20:23.750\nwhich we'll see in a later episode.\n\n421\n00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.750\nBut basically on the exam,\nthey want you to use time machine.\n\n422\n00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:27.530\nAnd I'll be honest with you.\n\n423\n00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.320\nTime machine is really reliable.\n\n424\n00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.550\nIt works really well.\n\n425\n00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.690\nYou turn it on and as long as your\nbackup hard drive is attached,\n\n426\n00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.560\nit's gonna backup every single hour.\n\n427\n00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.850\nOnce an hour, it's gonna do a backup and\nit does it pretty quickly.\n\n428\n00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:41.640\nThe only negative about time machine is\nthat you need a drive attached, right?\n\n429\n00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.350\nSo, what happens if your\nbuilding burns down?\n\n430\n00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.630\nYou lost your hard drive.\n\n431\n00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.646\nSo, on a server,\nit's a good idea to do disc rotation.\n\n432\n00:20:48.646 --> 00:20:51.603\nNot just have one removable drive,\nbut have two.\n\n433\n00:20:51.603 --> 00:20:55.760\nAnd that way, you plug one in,\nand take the other one offsite.\n\n434\n00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.495\nAnd then the next day,\n\n435\n00:20:56.495 --> 00:20:59.103\nyou bring the offsite one back, you plug\nit in, you take the other one offsite.\n\n436\n00:20:59.103 --> 00:21:02.348\nSo you're rotating, so\nthere's always one offsite or five drives,\n\n437\n00:21:02.348 --> 00:21:04.560\nseven, ten drives,\nhowever many as you need.\n\n438\n00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.670\nSo you've always got\na couple of them offsite,\n\n439\n00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.793\nin the event that you\nhave a building disaster.\n\n440\n00:21:08.793 --> 00:21:11.170\n>> Don, can you tell us a little bit\nmore about what's under the hood?\n\n441\n00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.514\nAre these a full backups or\nthis incremental,\n\n442\n00:21:13.514 --> 00:21:15.446\nare they're differential backups?\n\n443\n00:21:15.446 --> 00:21:19.030\nAnd I'm thinking and I'm sure you're gonna\ntalk about restoration coming up, but\n\n444\n00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.657\nI'm thinking about my restore time.\n\n445\n00:21:20.657 --> 00:21:24.566\nAm I might gonna be restoring for\nhours, or are they just incremental?\n\n446\n00:21:24.566 --> 00:21:27.492\n>> All right, so\nthe first one is a full backup.\n\n447\n00:21:27.492 --> 00:21:30.324\nLike, this backup is still running, so\nthis has got 18 minutes remaining, and\n\n448\n00:21:30.324 --> 00:21:32.555\nthat's cuz it's doing a full backup,\nbacking up everything.\n\n449\n00:21:32.555 --> 00:21:36.587\nAnd then from now on, every hour,\nit's gonna run an incremental backup, and\n\n450\n00:21:36.587 --> 00:21:40.435\nif you're not familiar with that term,\nan incremental backup just says,\n\n451\n00:21:40.435 --> 00:21:42.228\nget what changed in the last hour.\n\n452\n00:21:42.228 --> 00:21:45.290\nSo it's just whatever's changed\nin the last hour, and that's it.\n\n453\n00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:47.490\nAnd that's usually very small set of data.\n\n454\n00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:49.630\nSo your hourly backups run very,\nvery fast.\n\n455\n00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.360\nYour first backup will take a while, and\n\n456\n00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.780\nthen after that,\nthey start running much more quickly.\n\n457\n00:21:54.872 --> 00:21:58.261\nAll right, now, while that's running,\nI mentioned that if I have one hard drive,\n\n458\n00:21:58.261 --> 00:21:59.574\nthings are super easy, right?\n\n459\n00:21:59.574 --> 00:22:03.590\nStandard Time Machine, I probably didn't\nshow you anything new there, right?\n\n460\n00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:07.000\nBut if I have multiple hard drives, that's\nwhere things start to get a little quirky.\n\n461\n00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.950\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n462\n00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.930\nSo I'm gonna go back into by disk utility,\n\n463\n00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:12.740\nand I've got a second hard\ndrive floating over here.\n\n464\n00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:17.160\nI'm gonna erase this one and I'm gonna\ncall this my storage drive, right?\n\n465\n00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.060\nSo I want this to be for\nmy server apps to use.\n\n466\n00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.240\nWhere they put all their stuff,\nmy mail server and all those guys.\n\n467\n00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.630\nI mentioned in earlier episodes that when\nyou set up a server, if you're gonna do\n\n468\n00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:30.230\na second hard drive, it's better to set it\nup in the beginning than to do it later.\n\n469\n00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:32.490\nI didn't do that, so\nI just made the change.\n\n470\n00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.920\nBut fortunately,\nmy server is mostly empty.\n\n471\n00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.610\nI am running mail and messages,\ncontacts and calendar.\n\n472\n00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:40.220\nThey're gonna have to go offline while\nthey get moved to the other drive.\n\n473\n00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.690\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\nmove them right now.\n\n474\n00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:43.525\nSo, I'm gonna go up to my server.\n\n475\n00:22:43.525 --> 00:22:46.320\nI'm gonna go to my settings,\nand then I've got service data.\n\n476\n00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.954\nRight now is on Macintosh HD.\n\n477\n00:22:47.954 --> 00:22:51.941\nI'm gonna browse and I'm gonna put\nthat on my brand new storage drive.\n\n478\n00:22:51.941 --> 00:22:54.460\nAnd I'm gonna choose that, and\nso it's gonna tell me, hey,\n\n479\n00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.602\nI've got to stop the services\nwhile we move things.\n\n480\n00:22:56.602 --> 00:23:00.940\nI'm okay with that, I'll hit okay, and\nnow it's gonna go ahead and move them.\n\n481\n00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.970\nBut, I did the same thing\nin the other episode.\n\n482\n00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:07.610\nI forgot removable media will show up with\nignore permissions options turned on, so\n\n483\n00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:08.720\nI needed to turn that off.\n\n484\n00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.140\nI'm just gonna do a quick get\ninfo on that storage drive.\n\n485\n00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.110\nAnd go way down here at the bottom\nto sharing and permissions.\n\n486\n00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:20.749\nI'll unlock it, And\nas soon as that's unlocked,\n\n487\n00:23:20.749 --> 00:23:24.832\nI'll be able to come down here and\nuncheck that ignore ownership option.\n\n488\n00:23:24.832 --> 00:23:26.780\nYou've gotta get that one cleared out,\notherwise it doesn't work.\n\n489\n00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.870\nSo, let me just clear that out, and\n\n490\n00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:33.220\nnow we'll try it again, we're just gonna\nset that storage, and we'll choose.\n\n491\n00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:33.720\nThere we go.\n\n492\n00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.040\nDoesn't like making the same\nmistake twice, right?\n\n493\n00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.750\nSo now that that's done,\nit's gonna move all those services and\n\n494\n00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:41.460\nyou'll see it's stopping the services.\n\n495\n00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.420\nIt's taking them offline.\n\n496\n00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.810\nMy mail server, my chat server.\n\n497\n00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:45.249\nAll this stuff is offline now.\n\n498\n00:23:45.249 --> 00:23:47.381\nIt's moving the data to\nthis other drive and then,\n\n499\n00:23:47.381 --> 00:23:48.879\nit's gonna start it back up again.\n\n500\n00:23:48.879 --> 00:23:51.915\nAnd it'll take a little bit longer\nbecause that full backup is running in\n\n501\n00:23:51.915 --> 00:23:52.670\nthe background.\n\n502\n00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:58.120\nNow once that's done, I've now got\ndata on two different drives, okay?\n\n503\n00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.320\nIt's real important that you take a look\nat your Time Machine configuration to make\n\n504\n00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.850\nsure that it's backing up both drives.\n\n505\n00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:06.472\nBecause, what does Time Machine\nbackup by default?\n\n506\n00:24:06.472 --> 00:24:08.010\nMacintosh HD.\n\n507\n00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:10.070\nDoes it back up storage?\n\n508\n00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.750\nNo.\nIn fact,\n\n509\n00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.280\nremovable media is normally excluded.\n\n510\n00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.960\nSo if you have external media that's\nremovable, or even a second hard drive in\n\n511\n00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.550\nthe system, a lot of times they're gonna\nbe excluded from Time Machine, and boy,\n\n512\n00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:24.010\nthat is not something you want\nto learn after the fact, right?\n\n513\n00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:25.590\nYou don't want to be\nrunning Time Machine for\n\n514\n00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.750\nyears, all of a sudden\nyou have a failure and\n\n515\n00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:31.670\nyou realize your whole storage hard\ndrive was excluded from the backups.\n\n516\n00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.510\nThat's a terrible place to be, okay?\n\n517\n00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:36.290\nCheck the exclusions.\n\n518\n00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.533\nSo now that that's kinda running,\n\n519\n00:24:38.533 --> 00:24:42.670\nI'm gonna go back to my\nTime Machine window, here.\n\n520\n00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:43.730\nAnd in Time Machine,\n\n521\n00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:48.120\nit's basically setup, it's running,\nit never did ask me what disks to backup.\n\n522\n00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:53.749\nAnd if I go down here to Options, I can\nsee Exclude these items from backups.\n\n523\n00:24:53.749 --> 00:24:57.480\nAnd it's excluding Time Machine because it\ncan't back itself up, you don't want that.\n\n524\n00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.520\nBut it's also excluding my storage drive.\n\n525\n00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:06.030\nSo if I had left this alone, Time Machine\nwould not include all of my services.\n\n526\n00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.740\nI need to remove that\nfrom the Exclude list.\n\n527\n00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.830\nI do want to exclude the Time Machine\ndrive, you don't wanna back that up.\n\n528\n00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:15.200\nBut I definitely want to\nbackup the storage drive.\n\n529\n00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.570\nAnd so see how my backup just stopped\nbecause I changed the configuration?\n\n530\n00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.710\nAnd so\nnow I'm gonna have to start it again and\n\n531\n00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:26.730\nI need to start it again because it's\ngotta backup both drives and not just one.\n\n532\n00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.580\nIt rolls them into that same backup.\n\n533\n00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.650\nSo it's gonna kick off and\ndo that, all right?\n\n534\n00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:37.170\nDefinitely a key thing, I can't stress it\nenough, if you've got multiple drives,\n\n535\n00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:40.760\nTime Machine excludes the other drives\nby default, make sure you update that.\n\n536\n00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.010\n>> Don, can you tell us a little bit\nabout the data that's actually going to\n\n537\n00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.610\nbe backed up between\nthe different services and stuff?\n\n538\n00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:47.970\n>> Yeah, pretty much everything, right?\n\n539\n00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:52.660\nSo when it goes to back it up,\nit's gonna backup your Macintosh HD and\n\n540\n00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:55.860\nyour other drives that you've got\nattached, pretty much get the whole thing.\n\n541\n00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:00.300\nIt is actually kind of smart though\nbecause there is some data, I call it\n\n542\n00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:03.170\ngarbage data, I shouldn't call it garbage\ndata, because it does serve a purpose,\n\n543\n00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:07.315\nthings like temporary directories and\nlog directories it doesn't back those up.\n\n544\n00:26:07.315 --> 00:26:09.080\nThe reason is that they\nare always changing, right?\n\n545\n00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.806\nLogs are constantly changing and if you\nhave system failure, you're about to bring\n\n546\n00:26:12.806 --> 00:26:15.427\nup an all new system,\nyou don't need the old log files, you\n\n547\n00:26:15.427 --> 00:26:19.410\ndon't need temporary files because they'll\nall rebuild when the system boots backup.\n\n548\n00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.547\nSo if the system, if Time Machine,\n\n549\n00:26:21.547 --> 00:26:25.400\nrecognizes the files are not useful,\nit doesn't back them up, but\n\n550\n00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.130\nif it doesn't know, if it's your data,\nit backs it up, right?\n\n551\n00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:28.890\nThat's kinda the default.\n\n552\n00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:29.600\nIt will back it up.\n\n553\n00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.850\nSo it just excludes a handful of files and\nin the show notes,\n\n554\n00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:36.940\nwhich I'm trying to find here, I actually\nput in there some of the things that don't\n\n555\n00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:41.792\nget backed up, /libraries/logs,\n/libraries/caches,\n\n556\n00:26:41.792 --> 00:26:45.670\n/user/libraries/caches, those\nfolders get excluded.\n\n557\n00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:49.220\nAnd that's really good because one,\nthe data's not important and\n\n558\n00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:54.270\ntwo, there's usually thousands\nof very small files in there.\n\n559\n00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:57.020\nAnd those very small files\ntake a long time to backup,\n\n560\n00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:59.820\nbecause it's gotta calculate\nchecks on every one.\n\n561\n00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.910\nBacking up one large file is faster than\nbacking up a bunch of smaller files.\n\n562\n00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:06.160\nSo by excluding these,\nit speeds up the backup time,\n\n563\n00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.480\nso that's always a nice thing to have.\n\n564\n00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:13.220\nAll right, the other thing I\nwanna touch on, doing a restore.\n\n565\n00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:16.800\nWhen you restore with Time Machine, think\nabout the process you normally go through.\n\n566\n00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.920\nYou power on your machine.\n\n567\n00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.180\nYou boot to recovery.\n\n568\n00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.000\nYou hold cmd + R to boot to recovery.\n\n569\n00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.370\nIn recovery, you tell it you want\nto restore from Time Machine.\n\n570\n00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:28.280\nAnd when you restore from Time Machine,\nyou pick your Time Machine backup and\n\n571\n00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.730\nyou tell it to restore.\n\n572\n00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:31.580\nWell, guess what it does?\n\n573\n00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.970\nIt restores your Macintosh HD and\nthat's it.\n\n574\n00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:37.070\nIt doesn't restore your other drives,\nall right.\n\n575\n00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:40.140\nIt doesn't restore, like in my case,\nmy storage hard drive.\n\n576\n00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.530\nSo if I ever have to go and\n\n577\n00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:45.620\ndo a restore, it'll restore\nthe Macintosh HD automatically and\n\n578\n00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:49.410\nthen the first time it comes up,\nI have to go and restore my storage drive.\n\n579\n00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:52.590\nI would need to recreate a hard\ndrive called Storage, and\n\n580\n00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.680\nthen I would need to manually go into\nTime Machine, and restore that data.\n\n581\n00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.060\nNow doing it via the GUI is possible but\nit's time consuming.\n\n582\n00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.890\nIt's not incredibly reliable.\n\n583\n00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.750\nBetter to do it from the command line.\n\n584\n00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.400\nIf you've never done it from\nthe command line, I don't blame you.\n\n585\n00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.270\nThe tmutil is the command line utility for\nTime Machine and it's not\n\n586\n00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:13.580\nthe most user friendly, but let me show\nyou in case you ever bump in to this.\n\n587\n00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:20.610\nSo, on my system, I've got Macintosh HD\nand I've got storage, right?\n\n588\n00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:25.030\nSo I've got these two hard drives and when\nI restore a Time Machine, so I boot up in\n\n589\n00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:30.510\nrecovery, I restore from Time Machine, it\nrestores Macintosh HD, I boot up the first\n\n590\n00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:35.180\ntime, I go into disk utility, and I format\nout my storage drive, I call it storage.\n\n591\n00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.760\nYou could actually change\nthe name if you wanted, but\n\n592\n00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:40.250\nyou typically wanna keep it the same\nbecause things are relying on that path\n\n593\n00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:41.175\nexisting, right?\n\n594\n00:28:41.175 --> 00:28:45.310\n/volume/storage/,whatever, they\nexpect that to be there.\n\n595\n00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:47.100\nSo once it's got the same name,\n\n596\n00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:52.200\nthen I can initiate a time machine\nrestore, just of the storage drive.\n\n597\n00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:57.630\nYou can do a Time Machine restore for just\na single drive and it works like this.\n\n598\n00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.220\nThe first thing you need to\ndo is get into the directory,\n\n599\n00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.550\nwhere your Time Machine backup is.\n\n600\n00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:05.060\nSo, I'm gonna drop to a terminal,\nand I'm gonna use the cd, or\n\n601\n00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:11.400\nchange directory command, and\nI wanna go into /Volumes/Time\\ Machine/.\n\n602\n00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:16.340\nNow, if you don't use the terminal a lot,\nfiles can't have a space in their name so\n\n603\n00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.260\nanywhere there's a space,\n\n604\n00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:21.800\nyou have to put a back slash before it so\nthat it knows that it's a space okay.\n\n605\n00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.860\nIf you don't do that, it gets confused,\nand it doesn't work right.\n\n606\n00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:31.710\nSo as you're typing commands,\nyou can use tab autocomplete.\n\n607\n00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:34.150\nSo if I start to type a name,\nI can hit Tab.\n\n608\n00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:37.420\nAnd not only will it type it out, it will\nput those slashes in the file name for\n\n609\n00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.660\nme so that I don't have to worry about it.\n\n610\n00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.530\nSo I'm going to use that\na lot here on the show.\n\n611\n00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:43.880\nAnd in real life, I use it too so\nI don't forget those slashes, right?\n\n612\n00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:48.341\nSo as I go through here, I'm gonna\nchange into /Volumes/Time\\ Machine and\n\n613\n00:29:48.341 --> 00:29:53.142\non the Time Machine drive, there's really\nonly one folder, Backups.backupdb,\n\n614\n00:29:53.142 --> 00:29:57.219\nand I know that sounds like a database,\nbut it's really just a folder.\n\n615\n00:29:57.219 --> 00:30:00.180\nSo, if I change into that folder,\nI can see my backups.\n\n616\n00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.650\nWell, I get permission denied.\n\n617\n00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:04.360\nOkay, why is that?\n\n618\n00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.510\nWell, only administrators can get\ninto the backup on this drive.\n\n619\n00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:10.800\nIf it were a removable drive,\nit would have that, ignore ownership, and\n\n620\n00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:15.130\nit wouldn't care but on my local drive,\nI'm not ignoring ownership.\n\n621\n00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:18.030\nIt's got an owner, and the owner's\nthe administrator of the system.\n\n622\n00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:19.100\nAnd so, I need to be an administrator.\n\n623\n00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:22.310\nSo I'm gonna have to use the sudo\ncommand to kind of manipulate it, and\n\n624\n00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:25.980\nwork with this stuff, or I'm gonna\nhave to go and change the permissions,\n\n625\n00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.070\nto be able to break into it,\nwhich we don't want to have to do.\n\n626\n00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:33.970\nBut the data is in there,\nwe just can't necessarily see it, right?\n\n627\n00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:40.480\nSo if I do a sudo of that list command and\n\n628\n00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:44.700\ngo to look in there, you'll see\nthat I'm able to see in there and\n\n629\n00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.790\nin there is my server name OSX-SERVER01,\nright?\n\n630\n00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.540\nAnd so I can see that.\n\n631\n00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.784\nAnd then if I wanna look inside of that,\n\n632\n00:30:52.784 --> 00:30:59.260\nthen I can see there's a backup and\nthe backup is in progress, right.\n\n633\n00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:02.930\nSo until the backup is done,\nI can't really restore it.\n\n634\n00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:09.520\nBut let me show you the command as\nit would be and let me change this\n\n635\n00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:16.680\nprompt a little bit so\nI have just a little more room.\n\n636\n00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.340\nShoot, that's not right.\n\n637\n00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.960\nI need to do something like this.\n\n638\n00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:26.160\nI just tried to get a little\nmore screen real estate.\n\n639\n00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.560\nShoot, that's not working either.\n\n640\n00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.450\nWell let's see.\n\n641\n00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:28.990\nYou know what?\n\n642\n00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:30.660\nI'd better use V, all capital.\n\n643\n00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:31.810\nLet me just bump that up.\n\n644\n00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:32.760\nAnd there we are.\n\n645\n00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.450\nI just needed a smaller prompt to get\nthis whole command on the screen.\n\n646\n00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:38.460\nSo the command that you're\ngonna run is tmutil, right?\n\n647\n00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.770\nThat's the time machine utility and\n\n648\n00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:44.540\nI need the sudo this thing to make\nsure it's gonna run properly right.\n\n649\n00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:48.462\nI need to run it as administrator and\nso it's gonna be tmutil and\n\n650\n00:31:48.462 --> 00:31:51.423\nthen I need to tell that I'm restoring,\nokay.\n\n651\n00:31:51.423 --> 00:31:55.022\nAnd I almost always use the -v option\non this one so I get verbose output,\n\n652\n00:31:55.022 --> 00:31:56.803\nif I can see if there's any errors.\n\n653\n00:31:56.803 --> 00:31:59.455\nAnd then I need to tell it where\nthe data's coming from And\n\n654\n00:31:59.455 --> 00:32:00.789\nwhere the data's going to.\n\n655\n00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:04.913\nAnd the front part is the hard part,\nI normally change directories into where\n\n656\n00:32:04.913 --> 00:32:08.030\nthe backup is so\nI don't have to specify a giant path here.\n\n657\n00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:12.940\nI can actually just say ./* which says,\nthe source is everything in this\n\n658\n00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.700\ndirectory, but if I'm running it\nfrom outside of the directory,\n\n659\n00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:19.530\nlike I am here,\nthen what I can do is I can just specify.\n\n660\n00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:25.728\nIt'd be /Volumes/Time/\nMachine/Backups.backupdb/ and\n\n661\n00:32:25.728 --> 00:32:28.660\nthen you have the server name.\n\n662\n00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:31.835\nAnd I'm gonna screen\nwrap a bit on this one.\n\n663\n00:32:31.835 --> 00:32:35.140\n/Latest is what we normally want, right,\n\n664\n00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.670\nthat would be the last\nbackup that it took.\n\n665\n00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:40.940\nAnd I don't have a latest right now\nbecause my backup is currently running.\n\n666\n00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.899\nSo I'll just say, /Latest.\n\n667\n00:32:42.899 --> 00:32:46.201\nAnd then from there, we need,\n\n668\n00:32:46.201 --> 00:32:51.470\nlet's see, /Latest and then, the volume.\n\n669\n00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.500\nSo here's where it gets\na little bit weird,\n\n670\n00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.190\nbecause we have to specify\nthe start up volume.\n\n671\n00:32:55.190 --> 00:33:02.195\nAnd the start up volume,\nin my case is Macintosh HD, right?\n\n672\n00:33:02.195 --> 00:33:05.810\nSo Macintosh/HD is the startup volume and\nthat's where we would\n\n673\n00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:09.500\nnormally be restoring, because that's\nwhat we want right, is our main OS.\n\n674\n00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:10.980\nAnd so that's fine.\n\n675\n00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:14.840\nBut I also need to get the other volume,\nright?\n\n676\n00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.970\nSo I can leave that out because\ntechnically I've already restored that and\n\n677\n00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:23.400\nso now I can specify the other volume,\nin my case it would be /Storage, right.\n\n678\n00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.960\nSo I'm saying, restore the other drive.\n\n679\n00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.800\nNot Macintosh HD but storage.\n\n680\n00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:33.120\nAnd from there, we can then point\nit to the other location which\n\n681\n00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:38.060\nmy new location is just /Volumes/Storage\nso it's gonna know what to restore.\n\n682\n00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.430\nI'm actually leaving something\nkind of important out,\n\n683\n00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:43.370\nwhich is I need to say /Storage/*.\n\n684\n00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:48.088\nSo it knows to get everything from inside\nof that and put it in /Volume/Storage.\n\n685\n00:33:48.088 --> 00:33:53.250\nAnd that's gonna make it bring that data\nback and put it on the storage drive.\n\n686\n00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:55.160\n>> And that storage drive,\nif I remember right, Don,\n\n687\n00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:59.040\nthat has all of the service data\nthat you pointed over there, right?\n\n688\n00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:03.480\n>> Yeah,\nthat's where I moved that service data in.\n\n689\n00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.400\nBe careful because it\nshould be all of it but\n\n690\n00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.210\nlet me give you an example\nwhere it might not be.\n\n691\n00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:11.980\nSo when I go into OS 10 server here,\nmy server app.\n\n692\n00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:15.220\nI set my service data location\nto that storage drive but\n\n693\n00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:17.650\nsome services can be\nlocated somewhere else.\n\n694\n00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:21.380\nFor example, like the caching service,\nsee how it's got it's own setting for\n\n695\n00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:22.030\ncache location?\n\n696\n00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:24.100\nIt's still set to Macintosh HD.\n\n697\n00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.000\nIt can be set to a third or\na fourth hard drive, some other drive.\n\n698\n00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.540\nAnd I might need to go and get that.\n\n699\n00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:31.590\nSo I did the one that the global\nsetting was provided with.\n\n700\n00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:34.780\nBut check your individual services\nbecause they might have their own\n\n701\n00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:35.580\nstorage somewhere else.\n\n702\n00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:38.850\nMost of them don't so\nlike if I look at the mail server, right?\n\n703\n00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:42.600\nThe mail server doesn't have a setting\nin here for where that storage is.\n\n704\n00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.960\nI mean, you can set the mailbox size but\nyou cant' set where it resides.\n\n705\n00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.110\nIt uses the global setting so\nmailbox is covered.\n\n706\n00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:54.660\nMessages, calendar, context,\nthey're all covered, cache isn't.\n\n707\n00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:55.450\nNow to be honest with you guys,\n\n708\n00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:58.550\nI don't normally backup the cache\nbecause it's just a cache.\n\n709\n00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:00.282\nAnd the next time somebody\ngoes to download a file,\n\n710\n00:35:00.282 --> 00:35:02.135\nit pulls it from the internet and\nyou cache it again, so\n\n711\n00:35:02.135 --> 00:35:03.830\nyou don't really need to back that up.\n\n712\n00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:05.400\nSame thing with\nthe software update server.\n\n713\n00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.610\nI don't normally back that up because,\nagain,\n\n714\n00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:09.330\nI can just redownload those from Apple.\n\n715\n00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:13.740\nI'm more concerned about data that\nI can't recreate, like emails.\n\n716\n00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.600\nIf emails came into that mail server and\n\n717\n00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.920\nI lose the mail database,\nI can't just recreate those emails.\n\n718\n00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.660\nI guess you could,\n\n719\n00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:23.320\nyou could reach out to every person who\ncould've conceivably emailed you and\n\n720\n00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.730\nhave them resend you the email, that would\nbe a fun set of phone calls to make.\n\n721\n00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:31.420\nSo, you want to make sure you focus on\nthat data that you can't recreate, right?\n\n722\n00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:36.190\nKey thing to remember here is that\nTime Machine on a server works the same as\n\n723\n00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:41.490\nTime Machine on a workstation,\nunless you have more than one hard drive.\n\n724\n00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.070\nIf you have more than one hard drive,\nwhen you set up your Time Machine backup,\n\n725\n00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.760\nmake sure your external or\nextra hard drives are not excluded.\n\n726\n00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.290\nYou need to make sure they're\nincluded in the backup.\n\n727\n00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:54.380\nAnd then secondly, make sure you remember\nafter you restore from Time Machine that\n\n728\n00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:57.820\nyou may need to go back and\nrestore your hard drive, your external or\n\n729\n00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.440\nadditional hard drives also,\nas a separate step.\n\n730\n00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:04.420\nThose are kinda key differences\nbetween a server and a work station.\n\n731\n00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:05.290\n>> Great information.\n\n732\n00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:08.330\nIn this episode, we've been looking\nat proactive maintenance and\n\n733\n00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:09.570\nnot reactive maintenance.\n\n734\n00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:10.540\nRemember what Don said,\n\n735\n00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:14.130\ndon't wait until you need backups to\nfind out if you actually have backups.\n\n736\n00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:16.150\nBut it does look like we're\ncoming to the end of the episode.\n\n737\n00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:19.550\nDon, before we part ways here,\ngot anything else for us?\n\n738\n00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:23.810\n>> That's about it, the key, I think I've\nkind of already covered the key points,\n\n739\n00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:27.550\nbut I guess just one word of advice which\nis don't just turn on your backups and\n\n740\n00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:29.380\nforget about them, check them.\n\n741\n00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:30.600\nYou've got to check your backups.\n\n742\n00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.180\nCheck to make sure their occurring,\n\n743\n00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:35.360\nI mentioned how I like to stick\nthe Time Machine icon up in the menu bar,\n\n744\n00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.480\nbecause I can quickly see whether\nmy backups have run or not, right?\n\n745\n00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.830\nSo definitely set that up.\n\n746\n00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:42.730\nBut the other thing is, do test restores.\n\n747\n00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:46.690\nEvery now and then take your Time Machine\nbackup and go to a virtual machine, or\n\n748\n00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:49.770\na go to a MAC mini on your network,\nsomething, and just test the restore.\n\n749\n00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:52.790\nAnd go to restore it and\nsee if everything comes back and online.\n\n750\n00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:55.860\nIf it doesn't,\nyou know there's problem with your backup.\n\n751\n00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.500\nHey look, my external hard drive\nis not a part of this backup,\n\n752\n00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.710\nI can't restore services.\n\n753\n00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:02.270\nIt's better to spot that\non your own schedule\n\n754\n00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:03.820\nthan to spot it when a failure occurs.\n\n755\n00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.370\nYou definitely wanna see that earlier.\n\n756\n00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.030\nAnd on software updates,\n\n757\n00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:10.430\nmake sure that you don't just\nblanket roll out updates on servers.\n\n758\n00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:11.920\nOn workstations,\nyou can get away with it but\n\n759\n00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:16.210\non servers you need to make sure\nthey're online as much as possible.\n\n760\n00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:19.140\nSo test the updates first and\n\n761\n00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:23.540\nthen manually control the rollout\nby using a software update server.\n\n762\n00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.760\nIf you know you're not gonna maintain it\nthough, be honest with yourself and say,\n\n763\n00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.390\nhey, I'm not gonna maintain this.\n\n764\n00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:29.560\nAnd if that's the case,\n\n765\n00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:33.260\njust stick with the automatic updates from\nApple because then at least they get done.\n\n766\n00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:34.260\nThat's my advice.\n\n767\n00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.550\n>> All right, well Don, thank you for\nthat wealth of information.\n\n768\n00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:38.520\nAnd thank for\nour viewers out there for watching.\n\n769\n00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.650\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n770\n00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:42.360\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n771\n00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.138\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n772\n00:37:43.138 --> 00:37:45.350\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n773\n00:37:45.350 -->

swell Wes ready\nto dive right back in and\n\n8\n00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:31.075\nin this episode we're gonna be\ntackling some different topics.\n\n9\n00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:34.190\nI know we've been focusing on server\nadministration up until now but\n\n10\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.060\non this one we're gonna take a look at,\nwell,\n\n11\n00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.320\nuser authentication and\nuser accounts are kind of a special thing\n\n12\n00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.920\nin the OS 10 environment because\nyou've got that nice little GUI.\n\n13\n00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.590\nYou got the Apple world\nsitting on the surface, and\n\n14\n00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.250\nunderneath you've got the BSD Unix world.\n\n15\n00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.540\nAnd the two,\nmostly kind of mask each other.\n\n16\n00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.930\nSo if you're in the terminal\nyou just see the Unix side, and\n\n17\n00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.420\nif you're in the GUI you\njust see the Apple side.\n\n18\n00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.150\nBut they really both work in concert,\nthey work together.\n\n19\n00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.840\nWhere things get even more complex though,\n\n20\n00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.290\nis Apple doesn't just support\nits own native authentication.\n\n21\n00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.179\nIt supports third part systems too because\nit's rare that you just have an all Mac\n\n22\n00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.933\nenvironment.\n\n23\n00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:14.186\nYou typically have some\nwindows machines out there or\n\n24\n00:01:14.186 --> 00:01:16.820\nother things you might have\nauthenticated against.\n\n25\n00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.300\nAnd so Apple has multiple different\nways that users can authenticate\n\n26\n00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.320\nwhen they work with the system.\n\n27\n00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.260\nSo in this episode i wanna walk you\nthrough each of the different ones\n\n28\n00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.440\nthat might turn up on the exam.\n\n29\n00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.740\nThey expect you to know the different\nones that are available and\n\n30\n00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.340\nyou probably need to know them in real\nlife too because you might find where\n\n31\n00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.740\na user is able to log in on a computer\neven though they don't have a user account\n\n32\n00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.920\nin that computer they're like where\nthe heck is this coming from.\n\n33\n00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.210\nYou need to understand the different\n\n34\n00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.880\nplaces where that account\nmight be coming from.\n\n35\n00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.610\nAll right well let's kick things off and\n\n36\n00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.400\njust talk about what is authentication\nbecause there's a little bit of confusion\n\n37\n00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.950\namongst two security terms\nyou hear a lot about.\n\n38\n00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.060\nAuthentication and authorization, right?\n\n39\n00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.696\nAuthentication is the act of proving\nthat you are who you say you are.\n\n40\n00:01:59.696 --> 00:02:01.400\nAll right?\n\n41\n00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.880\nOn a Mac OS 10 machine, there's only\none way that you can prove who you are,\n\n42\n00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.260\nand that's through a username and\npassword combination, right?\n\n43\n00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.710\nIf I tell it that my\nusername is Don Puszet, and\n\n44\n00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.500\nif I tell it my password is password123,\nooh,\n\n45\n00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.670\nwe'll have to edit that out,\nI don't want people to know my password.\n\n46\n00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.290\nIf I say my password, password123,\n\n47\n00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.610\nthen the computer says, you must be Don,\nbecause you knew your own name.\n\n48\n00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.740\nThat's the mark of my intelligence,\nand then you knew your password.\n\n49\n00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.210\nBut the reality is, Wes,\nyou know my password now.\n\n50\n00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.350\nWes could log in on this computer, and\nthe computer would assume that he is me.\n\n51\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.250\nBecause he knows all\nthe necessary information.\n\n52\n00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.080\nHe knows my name and\nnow he knows my password.\n\n53\n00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.820\nSo it's not the greatest method available.\n\n54\n00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.940\nAnd I think everybody acknowledges that,\n\n55\n00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.970\nthat passwords are just\nnot the most reliable.\n\n56\n00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.820\nSo you're starting to see people\nmake pushes into other areas.\n\n57\n00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.990\nApple has done it,\nnot in Mac OS, but in IOS.\n\n58\n00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.490\nIn IOS they've enable the fingerprint,\nright, you can do touch ID to log in now.\n\n59\n00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.430\nOr you can do a pin number to log in, but\non your Mac OS desktop it's still a user\n\n60\n00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.730\nname and password combination\nthat's gonna get you in, all right.\n\n61\n00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.340\nThat's what authentication is all about,\n\n62\n00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.300\nproving who you are,\nproving that you are who you say you are.\n\n63\n00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.820\nAuthorization is different though.\n\n64\n00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.100\nAuthorization is where\nthe computer says okay,\n\n65\n00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.722\nnow that I know who you are,\nwhat are you allowed to do?\n\n66\n00:03:18.722 --> 00:03:22.940\nRight, maybe Wes has a user account,\nhe is marked as administrator.\n\n67\n00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.380\nI have a regular user account and\nit's just mark as a regular user, right?\n\n68\n00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.250\nAs an administrator,\nWes could do all sorts of things.\n\n69\n00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.940\nHe can even install software.\n\n70\n00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.410\nHe run unsigned application\ndownloaded from the internet.\n\n71\n00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.750\nBut for me as a regular user, I can't.\n\n72\n00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.460\nI can't run those unsigned application.\n\n73\n00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.250\nIt will prompt for\nadministrative privileges, right?\n\n74\n00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.860\nThat's part of authorization.\n\n75\n00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.810\nWes is authorized to do\ncertain activities and\n\n76\n00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.820\nI'm authorized to do certain activities.\n\n77\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.850\nBut we need both working together.\n\n78\n00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.590\nWe need authentication, so the computer\nknows who we are, and then we need\n\n79\n00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.000\nauthorization so that the computer\ncan figure out what we need to do.\n\n80\n00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.820\nAnd in this section,\n\n81\n00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.540\nI'm really gonna focus on authentication,\nnot authorization.\n\n82\n00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.420\nAuthorization normally takes the form of\naccess control lists, permissions, right?\n\n83\n00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.060\nWhen you share a folder out,\nyou set permissions.\n\n84\n00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.960\nThat's where authorization comes in.\n\n85\n00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.570\nBut just getting logged into the computer,\nthat's authentication.\n\n86\n00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.630\nAnd that's where we need to focus.\n\n87\n00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.580\nOn your Mac,\nit supports a number of different\n\n88\n00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.220\nauthentication methods that all boil\ndown to a username and a password.\n\n89\n00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.930\nBut the way that it handles\nthe password can be done differently.\n\n90\n00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.350\nSo let me, I am going to break\none of my old rules here.\n\n91\n00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.880\nAnd I am going to bring\nup a bulleted list.\n\n92\n00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.750\nI hate bulleted lists,\n\n93\n00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.090\nbut, this is one of those scenarios\nwhere we've got to have it.\n\n94\n00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.320\nOn the exam they expect you to\nmemorize all five of these.\n\n95\n00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.500\nSo I really want to stress how important\nit is to know all five of these and\n\n96\n00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.720\nhow important it is to change\nthe battery in your magic pad.\n\n97\n00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.082\nAs you can see mine is\napparently disappearing, but\n\n98\n00:04:48.082 --> 00:04:50.020\n[LAUGH] I'll survive without my magic pen.\n\n99\n00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.260\nSo, for authentication methods here,\nthe first one is a hash.\n\n100\n00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.810\nAll right, now what's a hash?\n\n101\n00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.040\nWell, one of the problems we have with\npasswords is that if you're gonna send\n\n102\n00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.750\nthem over the network,\n\n103\n00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.800\nsomebody could intercept that\npassword on the network, right?\n\n104\n00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.240\nAnd if they intercept that password,\nthey can now pretend to be you.\n\n105\n00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.170\nLike I already said, the computer\njust needs a username and password.\n\n106\n00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.820\nBut a hash is different.\n\n107\n00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.080\nWhat happens with a hash is,\nyou type your password.\n\n108\n00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.830\nAnd the computer runs your password\nthrough a hashing algorithm.\n\n109\n00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.660\nA hashing algorithm,\n\n110\n00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.250\nit's simply a formula, a little\nmathematical formula that it runs, and\n\n111\n00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.610\nit creates a string of letters and\nnumbers based off of your password.\n\n112\n00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.910\nIt's not your password.\n\n113\n00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.020\nIt can't even be reversed to\ncreate your password anymore.\n\n114\n00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.360\nIt's just, this is a representation\nof your password, and\n\n115\n00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.350\nthat's sent across the network.\n\n116\n00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.841\nAt the other end,\nthe server receives that.\n\n117\n00:05:39.841 --> 00:05:42.380\nAnd the server can't reverse it.\n\n118\n00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.590\nThe server can't interpret\nwhat that data is.\n\n119\n00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.234\nSo, what the server does,\nis it looks at its database and\n\n120\n00:05:46.234 --> 00:05:47.653\nit looks at what your\npassword is supposed to be.\n\n121\n00:05:47.653 --> 00:05:52.242\nAnd it runs the same formula and\nit creates a representation and\n\n122\n00:05:52.242 --> 00:05:55.110\nit compares the two representations.\n\n123\n00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.910\nSo its representations of the hashes.\n\n124\n00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.310\nIt compares the hashes and if the hashes\nmatch then we must have entered the same\n\n125\n00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.420\npassword and it let us in and it does that\nwithout ever actually seeing the password.\n\n126\n00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.080\nThese hashes are used all the time.\n\n127\n00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.260\nThey're used with Apple File Protocol when\nyou're browsing across the network and\n\n128\n00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.060\naccessing a file share somewhere,\nhash passwords are used so\n\n129\n00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.430\nthat we don't have to\ntransmit our real passwords.\n\n130\n00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.380\nAll right, so that's one authentication\nmethod that's out there, Hashes.\n\n131\n00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.760\nThe other option is what's called\na Crypt Password a crypt password\n\n132\n00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.450\nis one that's been encrypted and this\nactually stems from the old UNIX days.\n\n133\n00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.490\nUNIX would store all the user\npasswords in a little text file right\n\n134\n00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.140\non the hard drive.\n\n135\n00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.900\nI'll show that file it still exists.\n\n136\n00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.580\nAnd it would store you stuff there,\nbut they'd be encrypted.\n\n137\n00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.370\nWell, the computer could decrypt it.\n\n138\n00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.610\nIt had the key to decrypt those\npasswords to see what it was.\n\n139\n00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.320\nIt wasn't like a hash, it was just\nan encrypted version of the password.\n\n140\n00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.040\nApple does the same thing\nwith your Apple user account.\n\n141\n00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.740\nYour user account password is encrypted\nand stored with the user account inside of\n\n142\n00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.080\nthe OS 10 system, and it can be decrypted\nby the operating system to see what it is.\n\n143\n00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.920\nSo, it's a different use of that.\n\n144\n00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.090\nThen we've got a password server.\n\n145\n00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.570\nThe password server is where your system\ndoesn't have the password at all.\n\n146\n00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.110\nBut instead the password\nis stored somewhere else.\n\n147\n00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.620\nAnd the best example is\nApple Open Directory or\n\n148\n00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.120\nMicrosoft's Active Directory for\nthat matter.\n\n149\n00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.630\nBut Apple Open Directory is a great\nexample because you have a server\n\n150\n00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:20.800\nsomewhere on the network.\n\n151\n00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.449\nAnd it's got a database.\n\n152\n00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:23.519\nAnd the database is packed full\nof user names and password.\n\n153\n00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:26.390\nAnd so when someone authenticates\nthey provide a username and password,\n\n154\n00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.120\nyour work station doesn't\nknow if it's valid or not.\n\n155\n00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.430\nIt reaches out to this server and\n\n156\n00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.190\nit says, hey some guy just gave\nme this username and password.\n\n157\n00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.870\nIs this valid?\n\n158\n00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.000\nAnd the server will respond back yes or\nno.\n\n159\n00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.920\nThat's a password server.\n\n160\n00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.780\nKerberos.\n\n161\n00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.340\nKerberos is probably the most secure\nof the methods, that we've seen so far.\n\n162\n00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.020\nWhat Kerberos does is\nit actually uses hashes\n\n163\n00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.760\nas part of a network\nauthentication method.\n\n164\n00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.260\nThis was developed in the Unix world, but\nit's been adopted by Apple and Microsoft.\n\n165\n00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:01.560\nSo most Unix, Linux, Windows, Mac systems\nall use Kerberos for authentication.\n\n166\n00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.460\nThe greatest example of this that we\nsee is Microsoft's Active Directory.\n\n167\n00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:10.241\nYou can actually have an Apple Mac OS X\nmachine that authenticates against\n\n168\n00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:13.030\nMicrosoft's Windows Active Directory.\n\n169\n00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.260\nSo you can have a central directory\nof user accounts that works for\n\n170\n00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.910\nWindows and Mac, all tied together,\na lot of businesses do that.\n\n171\n00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.550\nDoesn't work so well the other way around.\n\n172\n00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.600\nLike if I want to have\nApple's Open Directory,\n\n173\n00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.650\nWindows machines don't really care for\nApple's Open Directory.\n\n174\n00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.660\nBut Macs work just fine with\nWindows Active Directory so\n\n175\n00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.880\nyou can kind of get that\ncommon environment.\n\n176\n00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.790\nBut Kerberos, it's an open standard,\nanybody can support it, and\n\n177\n00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:38.900\nas a result, most people do and\nso it's pretty widely accepted.\n\n178\n00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.500\nAnd the last one is LDAP.\n\n179\n00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.160\nLDAP is not actually\nan authentication method itself.\n\n180\n00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.780\nWhat is stands for\nis Light-weight Directory Access Protocol.\n\n181\n00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.080\nIt's a protocol,\nit's a way to talk to a database.\n\n182\n00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:56.350\nAnd examples of LDAP databases,\nwell Open Directory and Active Directory.\n\n183\n00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.510\nThose two guys, they're LDAP databases.\n\n184\n00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.470\nAnd so when you want to reach out to them\nand say somebody gave me a username and\n\n185\n00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.260\na password, you can use the LDAP\ncommunication methods to do that.\n\n186\n00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.460\nTo reach out and talk to it and\nexchange that information and\n\n187\n00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.870\nget the authentication.\n\n188\n00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:13.630\nSo these five different methods,\nthey're all built in to OS X.\n\n189\n00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.390\nThey're all right there in the system and\n\n190\n00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.850\nthey're ready to rock,\nyou just need to use them.\n\n191\n00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.360\nOr maybe you don't use them,\nsome you may use, some you may not.\n\n192\n00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.230\nWe rarely actually see them like this.\n\n193\n00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.060\nYou're really configuring\nsomething else entirely.\n\n194\n00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.010\nI can bind my client to\nan Active Directory,\n\n195\n00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.200\nat no point does it mention LDAP.\n\n196\n00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.480\nIt doesn't mention Kerberos,\nbut it's actually using both.\n\n197\n00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.460\nIt's all behind the scenes and\nthat's the way we like it.\n\n198\n00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.750\nWe wanna keep it behind the scenes.\n\n199\n00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.720\nNow, if you wanna see some of\nthis stuff in greater detail,\n\n200\n00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:50.440\nif we wanna dig down into the nitty gritty\npieces of it, let me show you an example.\n\n201\n00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.580\nSome of them I can't really\nshow you very well, like Crypt.\n\n202\n00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.140\nCrypt is the really old way of encrypting\npasswords and it's not considered safe,\n\n203\n00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.000\nand so it's not really used anymore.\n\n204\n00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.730\nBut, you can see where it used to be.\n\n205\n00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.920\nSo I'm gonna whip open the terminal here,\n\n206\n00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:10.880\nand if I browse to my hard drive,\nif I just browse to Macintosh HD.\n\n207\n00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.940\nI only see four folders, Applications,\nLibrary, System and Users.\n\n208\n00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.470\nThose are the ones that\nApple wants me to see.\n\n209\n00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.860\nBut there are a lot of other\nfolders that I never see.\n\n210\n00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.130\nEspecially Unix-related folders\nthat they don't want me to see cuz\n\n211\n00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.440\nI can break things and mess it up.\n\n212\n00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.470\nI shouldn't have any need to go into them.\n\n213\n00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.200\nSo if I wanna see the old crypt passwords,\nthey're\n\n214\n00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.280\nin one of those hidden folders that\nApple doesn't want you to see anymore.\n\n215\n00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.200\nSo if I go to a terminal and I pull up\na directory, see how there's more folders?\n\n216\n00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.650\nI'm actually not in the root,\nlet me get into the root.\n\n217\n00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:39.440\nThere we go.\n\n218\n00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.520\nThere's a lot more than just applications,\nlibrary, system, and users.\n\n219\n00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.380\nI see Volumes where my\nhard drives are mounted.\n\n220\n00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:51.994\nI see bin and sbin where there's binary\nfiles or operating system applications.\n\n221\n00:10:51.994 --> 00:10:58.290\nWe've got cores, dev, usr, var,\nall sorts of different folders that really\n\n222\n00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:03.260\nrelate to UNIX, to BSD running under\nthe hood so we normally ignore these.\n\n223\n00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.600\nBut one I looking for is etc.\n\n224\n00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:11.330\nIn a BSD world the etc directory is where\nit stores all of its configuration.\n\n225\n00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.390\nIn Mac OS, we have our system preferences.\n\n226\n00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:17.270\nThey're in /library, /preferences,\nor /system/library/preferences.\n\n227\n00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.989\nOr /user/dpezet/library/preferences, or\n\n228\n00:11:21.989 --> 00:11:27.000\n/network/library/preferences, there we go.\n\n229\n00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.340\nSo those are all the Mac\nconfigurations files.\n\n230\n00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.360\nBut in the UNIX world, it's /etc.\n\n231\n00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.690\nAnd if you go and poke around in here,\nyou'll see a lot of stuff.\n\n232\n00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:41.770\nAnd the file I'm looking for\nis called passwd, it's short for password.\n\n233\n00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:45.200\nAnd if I browse through here,\nwe'll find it.\n\n234\n00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.040\nThere it is, passwd.\n\n235\n00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.750\nIn the olden days, in the days of yore,\nso we're talking late 1970s,\n\n236\n00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.865\nprobably through the late 1980s,\n\n237\n00:11:54.865 --> 00:11:59.740\nusernames and passwords are stored\nright here in this file, /etc/passwd.\n\n238\n00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.850\nIf you ever broke into a Unix server and\nyou got this file, it was sweet,\n\n239\n00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:05.900\ncuz you just had everything,\nthis was the target for everybody.\n\n240\n00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:10.730\nAnd it's where things used to be and when\nthey were there, it used Crypt password.\n\n241\n00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.329\nWere it would encrypt the passwords, but\n\n242\n00:12:12.329 --> 00:12:14.550\nit was reversible encryption\nwhich is not good.\n\n243\n00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.118\nSo I take a look at that file.\n\n244\n00:12:16.118 --> 00:12:20.343\nActually, let me do a little\nsudo to look at it,\n\n245\n00:12:20.343 --> 00:12:22.530\ncuz you do need to be the administrator.\n\n246\n00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.980\nAnd we take a look in it,\nwhat am I gonna see?\n\n247\n00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.510\nWell, I'm gonna see user accounts.\n\n248\n00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.760\nActually, a lot of these are groups,\nbut you'll see a lot of stuff in here.\n\n249\n00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.640\nLet me just kinda scroll back up on it.\n\n250\n00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.440\nAnd each of these, the way it works,\nis it starts out with the username, and\n\n251\n00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.500\nthen it moves on to a password.\n\n252\n00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.780\nSo it used to say root as the user and\n\n253\n00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.870\nthen where this star is\nthere used to be a password.\n\n254\n00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.960\nIn the very beginning,\nit was in plain text.\n\n255\n00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.250\nI would see password one, two, three.\n\n256\n00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.310\nAnd then when it starting using crypt then\nyou would see an encrypted string there\n\n257\n00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.750\ninstead, so you'd see ciphertext.\n\n258\n00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.440\nNow, you just see a star.\n\n259\n00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.890\nWhat the heck does a star mean?\n\n260\n00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.470\nWell the star means people\nlearned really fast that\n\n261\n00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:10.710\nthis was a bad way to store passwords and\nso they moved it off somewhere else and\n\n262\n00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.520\nnow it's stored in a special\nfile called a shadow file.\n\n263\n00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:19.310\nAnd the shadow file uses a type of\nencryption that's not reversible.\n\n264\n00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.370\nIt's not something that we can mess with.\n\n265\n00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:25.630\nIt leverages hashes and other technologies\nto securely store that password and\n\n266\n00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.630\nkeep it safe.\n\n267\n00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:29.778\nSo the fact that this file exists,\nisn't really a big deal.\n\n268\n00:13:29.778 --> 00:13:35.010\nThat was /etc/passwd, but\nthat's where crypt passwords were used.\n\n269\n00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.890\nThe other one I mentioned was shadow.\n\n270\n00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.775\nAnd that's gonna be /etc/shadow.\n\n271\n00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:45.839\nNow for a regular user, they don't even\nsee this file exists, it doesn't show up.\n\n272\n00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:51.310\nAs an admin so, I'm doing sudo\nto run in this as superuser, and\n\n273\n00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:55.610\nwhen I run that,\nI get no such file or directory.\n\n274\n00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:00.670\nI know it's there, right,\nbut it's not there.\n\n275\n00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.483\nIt's in the heart of the operating system\nthat I'm not allowed to touch that file,\n\n276\n00:14:04.483 --> 00:14:05.909\nI'm not allowed to look at it.\n\n277\n00:14:05.909 --> 00:14:11.152\nAnd so when I get in here and\nI pull up this list,\n\n278\n00:14:11.152 --> 00:14:14.790\nI don't' see that file at all.\n\n279\n00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:18.220\nAnd what's going on is the system\nis protecting me from seeing that.\n\n280\n00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:23.610\nThat file is just non-existent to me.\n\n281\n00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.460\nI don't see that shadow file at all.\n\n282\n00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.710\nSo now the passwords are much more\nsecure and we can't get to them.\n\n283\n00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:32.390\nOn some Unix systems, yeah,\nyou can actually see the shadow file, but\n\n284\n00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.940\nif you go into it there's nothing in there\nthat you can see, because it's protected.\n\n285\n00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.620\nSo that's the shadow file.\n\n286\n00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:44.410\nNow I mentioned that Apple does still\nstore some passwords in your user account.\n\n287\n00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:50.540\nSo not here, you might have noticed in\nthat passwd file, I'm logged in as dpezet,\n\n288\n00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:57.970\nbut if I do a more of\nthat /etc/passwd file and\n\n289\n00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:01.440\nI look for my name, I'm not in there.\n\n290\n00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.620\nWhat the heck, I have a user account but\nI'm not on the password file.\n\n291\n00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.900\nHow does that work?\n\n292\n00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.320\nWell, Apple stores the user\naccount somewhere else.\n\n293\n00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.790\nAnd this probably won't show up on the\nexam, but I always get this question after\n\n294\n00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.360\nthe show, so I'm gonna go and\nthrow it in here anyway.\n\n295\n00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.780\nLet me show you where it stores them.\n\n296\n00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.450\nYour password is stored\nin your user account and\n\n297\n00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.550\nyour user account is stored in\nApple's authentication database.\n\n298\n00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.350\nAnd that application\ndatabase is protected.\n\n299\n00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.140\nIt's kind of stashed away so\nthat you can't mess with it.\n\n300\n00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.390\nIt's actually in the var folder.\n\n301\n00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:35.910\nSo if I get into this /var/db,\nso this is a database folder.\n\n302\n00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:41.960\nAnd one of the databases that's\nin here is our dslocal database.\n\n303\n00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.580\nAnd it's in here somewhere.\n\n304\n00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.160\nRight there, dslocal.\n\n305\n00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.380\nAnd what that is is\ndirectory server local.\n\n306\n00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.980\nDirectory server,\nlike in Apple Open Directory.\n\n307\n00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:57.311\nEvery single workstation runs its\nown miniature directory server, and\n\n308\n00:15:57.311 --> 00:16:00.080\nthat's where your user\naccounts get stored.\n\n309\n00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.660\nAnd this starts to get\nprotected real fast.\n\n310\n00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.380\nLike I don't think it'll even\nlet me in that folder, will it?\n\n311\n00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.360\nActually it will,\nall right, so let's dig in.\n\n312\n00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.195\nWe'll see how far I can get before I\nget blocked, and so I'm kinda drilling,\n\n313\n00:16:10.195 --> 00:16:12.026\nthere we go, on the default folder.\n\n314\n00:16:12.026 --> 00:16:15.732\nSo I was able to get to\n/var/db/dslocal/nodes and\n\n315\n00:16:15.732 --> 00:16:20.178\nthen when I got there,\nthat's where I got permission denied and\n\n316\n00:16:20.178 --> 00:16:22.915\nI can override that with a little sudo.\n\n317\n00:16:22.915 --> 00:16:27.752\nAnd I'm gonna pull up\nthe default directory.\n\n318\n00:16:27.752 --> 00:16:32.230\nAnd as I look in there, here I start\nto see aliases, computers, config,\n\n319\n00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:36.250\ngroups, networks,\nshare points, users, right?\n\n320\n00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:41.250\nSo, as I keep looking in here, I'll start\nto find more and more information, and\n\n321\n00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.550\nlook who we just found.\n\n322\n00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.758\nDpezet, right, that's me,\nhey, I got a user account.\n\n323\n00:16:45.758 --> 00:16:49.010\nSo that's where my user account is stored\nthere, and you see my file is kind of\n\n324\n00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.830\nlarger than some of these other ones\ncuz it's an active user account.\n\n325\n00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:53.400\nA lot of these other accounts\nare service accounts,\n\n326\n00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.870\nthey don't have home directories and\nso the files are small.\n\n327\n00:16:55.870 --> 00:17:01.340\nBut, that's mine, that's me and\nmy password is stored, encrypted,\n\n328\n00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.769\nin that file and hidden away right there,\nthat's my local user database.\n\n329\n00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:08.010\nAll right, if you want to see that file,\n\n330\n00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:12.460\nunfortunately it is a binary plist,\nleast I think it is.\n\n331\n00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:17.900\nLet's see if we can't look at it.\n\n332\n00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:23.020\nPlist files they can be XML or\nplain text or they can be binary file.\n\n333\n00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:27.850\nI'm pretty sure this one is a binary file,\nso if I try and view inside of it.\n\n334\n00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:30.230\nYeah, it's a binary file so\nI can't do it that way, but\n\n335\n00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.330\nwe can probably use good old plutil.\n\n336\n00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:35.370\nLet me do this.\n\n337\n00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.888\nI'm gonna try and\nbreak Apple's rules here for a second.\n\n338\n00:17:37.888 --> 00:17:42.310\n>> And those plist files Don, too,\nI'm sure this is probably basic Unix,\n\n339\n00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.040\nthose store user settings, right?\n\n340\n00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.200\nYeah, it's the user account,\neverything about that user account.\n\n341\n00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.920\n>> Right.\n>> So your full name, your password,\n\n342\n00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:56.930\nyour username, what your login items are,\nwhat applications run when you login.\n\n343\n00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:00.070\nAll that kind of stuff that you see\nin the user system preferences,\n\n344\n00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.990\nthat's what's all stored in there,\nand so there we go.\n\n345\n00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:07.260\nNow that I just extracted it,\nwhat you can see is,\n\n346\n00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.630\nyeah this giant binary rainbow table.\n\n347\n00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:15.580\nWe're just going to get to the top here,\nand come on, there we go.\n\n348\n00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:16.950\nAll right, so it starts right here.\n\n349\n00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.660\nThis is the very beginning,\nI've got account policy data, all right.\n\n350\n00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.162\nWhat's the account policy data?\n\n351\n00:18:22.162 --> 00:18:26.558\nWell, those are the protected policy\nsettings that apply to my account and\n\n352\n00:18:26.558 --> 00:18:29.699\nthey might be coming from\nApple's profile manager or\n\n353\n00:18:29.699 --> 00:18:32.460\njust settings right here on the system.\n\n354\n00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.340\nBut these are encoded and so\nI can't actually see what they are.\n\n355\n00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.370\nAnd I have a JPEG photo attached\nto my user account, and\n\n356\n00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:43.190\nso here is that JPEG photo\nencoded in the storage here.\n\n357\n00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.700\nSo this is all binary data that's\nwhy it's showing up messy like that.\n\n358\n00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:51.490\nBut after the binary data I'll\nget to XML that I can read and\n\n359\n00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:56.160\nsometimes you can glean a little good\ninformation out of it like my real name.\n\n360\n00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.230\nThere's my full name, Don Pezet.\n\n361\n00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.730\nHere's my Unix name, dpezet.\n\n362\n00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:02.846\nHere's my home directory, /Users/dpezet.\n\n363\n00:19:02.846 --> 00:19:09.260\nThese are the settings that apply to\nmy user account and my KerberosKeys.\n\n364\n00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.120\nWhat the heck could that be?\n\n365\n00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.120\nThere's my password.\n\n366\n00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:16.090\nThis is my private key,\nmy key that I use to access things.\n\n367\n00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.900\nHere's my ShadowHashData, right?\n\n368\n00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.210\nSo it's my Shadow Data and it's a hash,\n\n369\n00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:25.380\nso I can't reverse this to\nextract a password out of it.\n\n370\n00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:29.545\nI can only type a new password, hash it,\nand see if I get the same result, so\n\n371\n00:19:29.545 --> 00:19:32.850\nnon-reversible encryption,\nnot technically encryption.\n\n372\n00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.480\nThere's my user ID, and so on.\n\n373\n00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.520\nSo I'm seeing a lot of this information,\nand\n\n374\n00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.500\nhere's my old backwards compatible\npasswd password, right.\n\n375\n00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.670\nAnd see how it's just got\na bunch of stars in there?\n\n376\n00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.970\nAnd that's because it's\nnot actually stored here.\n\n377\n00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:46.990\nI'm looking at the file.\n\n378\n00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:47.860\nIt's not actually stored there.\n\n379\n00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.600\nSo this information is all\ntucked away right here.\n\n380\n00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.230\nSo it's all in the background.\n\n381\n00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:56.260\nIt's all happening, on the exam\nthey expect you to know it, but\n\n382\n00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.400\nin real life you never see it.\n\n383\n00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.100\nIt is all kind of invisible to us.\n\n384\n00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.430\n>> Looks like Apple has done a pretty\ngood job of trying to keep you out and\n\n385\n00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:03.850\naway from that file as best they can.\n\n386\n00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:08.340\nBecause I know in other systems, like\nthe Windows system, was it the NTLM file,\n\n387\n00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.255\nif you could get ahold of that,\nyou pretty much had access to the system.\n\n388\n00:20:11.255 --> 00:20:14.410\n>> Yeah, with brute force,\nit would take time, but\n\n389\n00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:17.790\nonce you have the file you could brute\nforce it, here it's much more difficult.\n\n390\n00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.980\nAll right, we haven't done any\nepisodes on Open Directory yet, but\n\n391\n00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.770\nif you have an Open Directory, that's\none more place those user accounts and\n\n392\n00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.940\npasswords could be stored and\nthey are stored in the /var folder also.\n\n393\n00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:35.620\nI don't have it installed but where it\nwould be is /var/db, and then in here, you\n\n394\n00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:40.190\nwould have an Open Directory folder, which\nactually would be buried under openldap.\n\n395\n00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:44.290\nSo if I go into openldap,\nbecause Apple's Open Directory,\n\n396\n00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:45.300\nthey didn't write it from scratch.\n\n397\n00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.670\nIt's actually a fourth of\nthe openldap project, and\n\n398\n00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:52.490\nso, here's my openldap folder, and\nyou know, I don't have it installed.\n\n399\n00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:55.625\nBut I have an openldap-data folder,\nthat's where it would be, and\n\n400\n00:20:55.625 --> 00:20:57.417\nthat's where your database would be.\n\n401\n00:20:57.417 --> 00:20:59.785\nMine's empty right now I just\nhave a DB_CONFIG example and\n\n402\n00:20:59.785 --> 00:21:02.780\nthat's because I haven't run\nthe Open Directory configuration wizard.\n\n403\n00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.850\nBut if I created one this\nis where it would be.\n\n404\n00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:07.760\nAnd the user accounts and passwords are\nstored securely inside of that database.\n\n405\n00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:14.799\nSo that path is /var/db/openldap, right,\nthat's where that gets buried away at.\n\n406\n00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.690\nAll right, so a couple of different\nplaces those things can hide away, and\n\n407\n00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.120\nthere's our information.\n\n408\n00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:26.610\nNow, we normally see this from the GUI,\nnot from the command line.\n\n409\n00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:28.960\nFrom the GUI, we see far less.\n\n410\n00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.850\nLet me show you on a regular\ndesktop what you would see.\n\n411\n00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:35.890\nI'm gonna go into my System Preferences,\nand in System Preferences,\n\n412\n00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:40.510\nI'm just gonna go into the Users\n& Groups system preference.\n\n413\n00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:43.300\nAnd when I go into that,\nI see all these user accounts.\n\n414\n00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.910\nNow what did it just do?\n\n415\n00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:49.170\nIn the background,\nit went into that /var, /db,\n\n416\n00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:52.720\n/ds local folder and\nit queried all the users and\n\n417\n00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.090\ngroups that I had and it put them right\nhere, and I only had one real user.\n\n418\n00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:58.940\nThere's some users that are hidden,\nlike the root user.\n\n419\n00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.440\nThe root user exists because\nUnix requires it, but\n\n420\n00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.140\nit's hidden here because we don't use it.\n\n421\n00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.490\nApple doesn't even tell\nus what the password is,\n\n422\n00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:07.390\nI don't know the password for\nthat root account.\n\n423\n00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:10.760\nBut here's my user account and\nif I start creating more accounts,\n\n424\n00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.720\nit's going to be placing them\nin that DS local folder.\n\n425\n00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.519\nNow, I see when I click on here,\nsimple information about myself.\n\n426\n00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.640\nMy name, my JPEG picture,\n\n427\n00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.160\nright, my contact card if I have one,\na few other basic things.\n\n428\n00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:29.960\nI'm not really seeing all that much\nhere as far as excitement, right?\n\n429\n00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:36.670\nBut, if I Ctrl+click, or\nif I hit my right-click, if you have it,\n\n430\n00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:41.550\nand go to Advanced Options on that\nuser account In the advanced options,\n\n431\n00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.560\nnow we can start to see the things\nthat were behind the scenes, right?\n\n432\n00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.850\nThe full name, the account name,\ngroup that I'm in.\n\n433\n00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:52.410\nThere's my UNIX,\nmy universally unique identifier, my UUID.\n\n434\n00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:56.780\nYou can start to see a lot of additional\ninformation here that's stored in that\n\n435\n00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:00.480\ndatabase that's just kind of hidden\nfrom us, that we don't normally see.\n\n436\n00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.320\nAll right.\n\n437\n00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.530\nIf I were bound to an open directory,\nthese accounts wouldn't exist locally.\n\n438\n00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:05.530\nThey would exist on the network and\n\n439\n00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:09.330\nwe're gonna see that in the Open Directory\nepisodes a little bit later, but\n\n440\n00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.200\nbasically we can see\nmore information in here.\n\n441\n00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.710\nI keep doing this with the users.\n\n442\n00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:13.980\nThese could be groups too, right?\n\n443\n00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:19.590\nIf I add a group, so maybe I add a group\nwhich I'll call, we'll do Students.\n\n444\n00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.350\nAll right, so I'm gonna create\na group called Students, and\n\n445\n00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:23.800\nI'll just create that and put it in place.\n\n446\n00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:27.370\nAnd so now we've got a group\ncalled Students stored right here.\n\n447\n00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:30.860\nI can put myself in it, right, so\nnow I'm a student, very exciting.\n\n448\n00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.540\nAll that's being stored in dslocal\ntoo and, did I leave myself in?\n\n449\n00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.358\nNo I closed the stinking window.\n\n450\n00:23:36.358 --> 00:23:39.869\nI was gonna say if I had left myself\nin there we could go in and look.\n\n451\n00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:45.480\nLet's do this I'm gonna cheat\na little bit and do sudo sh.\n\n452\n00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.350\nSudo sh is kind of a little cheating\ncommand I do from time to time because\n\n453\n00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:52.430\nwhat it's gonna do is give a root shell,\nso that every command I now run is running\n\n454\n00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.030\nas root, if I do a who am I see\nthat says that I'm root now.\n\n455\n00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.956\nI don't know root's password but\nI was an administrator so\n\n456\n00:23:57.956 --> 00:23:59.370\nit let me impersonate root.\n\n457\n00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:00.930\nSo now I can browse wherever I want.\n\n458\n00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.310\nI'm kinda being lazy.\n\n459\n00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:06.482\nSo I'm gonna browse back\ninto the old dslocal and\n\n460\n00:24:06.482 --> 00:24:09.950\nif I get into nodes and default, right?\n\n461\n00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:14.295\nIn here is where I saw users,\nand if I look inside of users,\n\n462\n00:24:14.295 --> 00:24:16.930\nthere's dpezet, right?\n\n463\n00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.010\nAnd maybe I create another one,\n\n464\n00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:22.080\nI'm gonna create a user account,\nwhoops, for Wes, right?\n\n465\n00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.999\nSo I'm gonna go and\nadd a user account for Wes.\n\n466\n00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.880\nSo, you'll be Wes Bryan.\n\n467\n00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:33.030\nI'll make you wbryan, and I'll give\nyou an amazingly secure password,\n\n468\n00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:33.820\n>> All dots.\n\n469\n00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:34.528\n>> No, password123.\n\n470\n00:24:34.528 --> 00:24:35.742\nAll dots, yes.\n\n471\n00:24:35.742 --> 00:24:36.950\n[LAUGH].\n\n472\n00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:39.550\nAll right, so I'm gonna get that created.\n\n473\n00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:42.065\nThis is my password hint.\n\n474\n00:24:42.065 --> 00:24:45.150\nAll right, so, creating all that for\n\n475\n00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.990\nWes, he's now got a user account\nright here, and he's a standard user.\n\n476\n00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:55.340\nNow, when I go back to that folder, what\nI should see, sure enough, there it is.\n\n477\n00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.780\nWes has a plist file, right?\n\n478\n00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:03.530\nAnd if I do the whole plutil -p against\nhis plist file, I can come in and\n\n479\n00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:08.618\ntake a look at it and\nlook at the data that's in there, right.\n\n480\n00:25:08.618 --> 00:25:12.790\nSo, here's that same kinda\ninformation we were seeing before.\n\n481\n00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.780\nHere's that password hint, right there.\n\n482\n00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.140\nNotice I didn't secure the password hint,\nright.\n\n483\n00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.430\nI know his password hint now.\n\n484\n00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.220\nWell, I could have found out\nhis password hint anyway.\n\n485\n00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.480\nIf I tried to log in as him and\n\n486\n00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.720\nI put the wrong password it's gonna\nshow me the hint on the screen.\n\n487\n00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.010\nIt's not something you need to secure, but\n\n488\n00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:32.100\nI can't see what his password is\ncuz his password is stored up here,\n\n489\n00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.400\nwith all this mess, and so\nI don't know what it is, right?\n\n490\n00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.190\nI can't extract his password from that.\n\n491\n00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:42.790\nAnd then the group is the same way,\nif I, shoot, I lost the path I was in.\n\n492\n00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:43.460\nThere we go.\n\n493\n00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:48.440\nSo, if I get into the groups folder and\nI take a look inside a groups,\n\n494\n00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.040\nwe should find one in here called\nstudent buried in here somewhere.\n\n495\n00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:54.690\nAnd that will be where\nit stored that group.\n\n496\n00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:58.300\nIt's in here somewhere.\n\n497\n00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.745\nThere it is, right there.\n\n498\n00:25:59.745 --> 00:26:00.980\nStudents.plist.\n\n499\n00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:01.909\nThat's where that group is stored, right.\n\n500\n00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:04.410\nSo, all this is happening\nbehind the scenes.\n\n501\n00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:06.400\nThat's the local database.\n\n502\n00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.010\nThe open directory is really\nthe same basic process because this\n\n503\n00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:13.480\nis a miniature open directory that's\njust being stored here locally.\n\n504\n00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.460\nThe shared open directories the same\nthing it just works across the network.\n\n505\n00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.750\nThis only works locally on the system.\n\n506\n00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:23.960\nAll right, lets see I feel\nlike I'm missing something.\n\n507\n00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.390\nI know what I'm missing.\n\n508\n00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:29.190\nI wanted to talk a little bit\nabout how Kerberos works and\n\n509\n00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:33.250\nhow it handles what we run on the system\nand why it's so important, all right?\n\n510\n00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:38.156\nIf you watched my ACSP show, the Apple\nCertified Support Professional show,\n\n511\n00:26:38.156 --> 00:26:42.318\nI really drill down the whole boot\nprocess and how Apples boot up and\n\n512\n00:26:42.318 --> 00:26:44.566\ngo to the whole system of starting.\n\n513\n00:26:44.566 --> 00:26:49.050\nI don't wanna do that here because what's\nimportant is really just one piece of it.\n\n514\n00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:52.580\nWhen you log in on a Mac, there's\nsome interesting stuff that happens.\n\n515\n00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.900\nLet me show you.\n\n516\n00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.930\nSo, If I log out,\nlet me just log out of this system.\n\n517\n00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:02.250\nWhen the system boots up the Mac OS kernel\nstarts and the kernel is called Darwin.\n\n518\n00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:07.210\nSo Darwin starts and then Darwin launches\na few processes and those processes start.\n\n519\n00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:10.710\nAnd then it launches a very special\nprocess called login window and\n\n520\n00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:12.120\nthat's what I'm looking at right here.\n\n521\n00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.590\nI'm looking at the login window process.\n\n522\n00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:19.820\nAnd when I pick a user account like\nDon Pezet, and I provide a password, I'm\n\n523\n00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:26.800\nlogging in and the login window service\nbecomes me, it takes over my identity.\n\n524\n00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:32.180\nI authenticate and I'm given what's called\na ticket granting ticket, or a TGT, right?\n\n525\n00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:34.170\nThis is a key part of Kerberos.\n\n526\n00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:40.030\nThe TGT lets me run other\nprocesses as myself.\n\n527\n00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:45.430\nI can grant other processes a ticket,\nor it's usually called a token but\n\n528\n00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:48.670\nin the official terminology it's a ticket,\non the exam you'll see ticket.\n\n529\n00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:51.010\nOn the Internet you'll\nsee token more often.\n\n530\n00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:55.720\nBut, I can give a ticket to any process\nand I can say, now you can run as me.\n\n531\n00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:01.840\nSo, anytime I run Safari or Pages or\nFinder they're running as me.\n\n532\n00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.680\nSo that Safari has the same\npermissions as I do.\n\n533\n00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.380\nAnd Finder has the same permissions I do.\n\n534\n00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.560\nOr Disc Utility has the same\npermissions that I do.\n\n535\n00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.780\nIf I am an administrator, that means\nthese are running as administrators.\n\n536\n00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:15.300\nIf I'm a standard user,\nthey're running as a standard user.\n\n537\n00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.620\nEverything's running as me.\n\n538\n00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.820\nSo, if I come in here and\nI launch Safari, all right?\n\n539\n00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:24.580\nSo here I am, I'm running Safari and\nI go to www.apple.com.\n\n540\n00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.850\nOkay, so I'm running Safari.\n\n541\n00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:28.330\nIt's running right there.\n\n542\n00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:29.780\nI go to Apple's website.\n\n543\n00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.360\nIf I switch to Wes.\n\n544\n00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.140\nSo I'm gonna jump over,\nI'm gonna log in as Wes.\n\n545\n00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:36.110\nNow this is my first\ntime logging in as Wes so\n\n546\n00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:38.300\nit's going to take a moment as it\ncreates his profile and stuff.\n\n547\n00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.640\nHe has a log in window just like I did.\n\n548\n00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.380\nAnd he has a TGT,\na Ticket Granting Ticket,\n\n549\n00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:50.210\nthat's letting him run programs as himself\nand the operating system is able to\n\n550\n00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:54.000\nkeep these programs separate because\nthe ticket's attached to them.\n\n551\n00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.870\nIt sees the ticket and it says this\ncopy of Safari is running from Wes.\n\n552\n00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:59.900\nThis other copy of Safari is running for\nDon and\n\n553\n00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.550\nit knows that based on the tickets.\n\n554\n00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:05.100\nSo, as I soon as I manage\nto get logged in as him,\n\n555\n00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:10.070\nI have to resist the Apple ID kind of push\nthere, but as soon as I get logged in\n\n556\n00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:13.260\nas him I can launch Safari\nthere'll two separate things.\n\n557\n00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:18.020\nNow, where we see this\nis kinda interesting.\n\n558\n00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.570\nYou can go in the activity monitor and if\nyou're an admin you can see your stuff in\n\n559\n00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:24.000\nthe system but\nyou don't normally see other users.\n\n560\n00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.510\nSo now that I'm logged in as Wes here,\nI'm just gonna go to www.apple.com.\n\n561\n00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:31.528\nAll right, so he launched Safari and\nwent to Apple, I launched Safari and\n\n562\n00:29:31.528 --> 00:29:32.170\nwent to Apple.\n\n563\n00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.005\nLet me switch back to myself.\n\n564\n00:29:35.005 --> 00:29:38.040\nI'm gonna have an identity\ncrisis here in a minute.\n\n565\n00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.850\nSo, let me gt back here logged\nin as myself, there we go, and\n\n566\n00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:43.430\nI'm gonna launch the activity monitor.\n\n567\n00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.735\nAll right, in the activity monitor,\nunder CPU,\n\n568\n00:29:47.735 --> 00:29:50.830\nyou can see every process\nrunning on your computer.\n\n569\n00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:53.560\nYou see the process and\nyou see who ran it and\n\n570\n00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.530\nsee how all of these over here say dpezet.\n\n571\n00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:58.030\nI ran them, right?\n\n572\n00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.660\nAnd the very first one,\nif I sort it by process ID,\n\n573\n00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:05.610\nthe one with the lowest process ID\nis the first one that ran as me.\n\n574\n00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:11.050\nAnd if I come over here and\nlook, well it's distnoted,\n\n575\n00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:12.760\nwhich is one of the launch processes.\n\n576\n00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:17.780\nBut the first one that is really important\nis this guy right here, loginwindow, okay.\n\n577\n00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.610\nThese other ones are running as\nme because I'm an administrator.\n\n578\n00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:23.260\nA regular user wouldn't see those,\nloginwindow would be their first one.\n\n579\n00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:30.200\nSo loginwindow, I provided my username and\npassword to it, and it ran as me, right?\n\n580\n00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.440\nAnd so it kicked in and now everything\nafter that is being run as me.\n\n581\n00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:39.890\nSo when we start running other processes,\nwe'll see those kick in as me.\n\n582\n00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:44.870\nSo, these guys here have a lower process\nnumber cuz I must have started them,\n\n583\n00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:46.480\nit's the server app\nthat's doing that right?\n\n584\n00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.160\nCuz I started the services as me before.\n\n585\n00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:54.580\nThis one, 6580, anything with a process ID\nhigher than 6580 is from this session and\n\n586\n00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.130\nso that's the first one\nwith that session number.\n\n587\n00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:58.910\nAnd then each of the programs\nthat I run since then.\n\n588\n00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:01.890\nSo, I should be able to find\nSafari in this list, right?\n\n589\n00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:04.740\nIt would be one of the later\nthings that I ran.\n\n590\n00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:05.810\nThere it is.\n\n591\n00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:07.910\nThere's Safari and it's running as me.\n\n592\n00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:10.290\nMy ticket is attached to it.\n\n593\n00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:13.200\nNow, I know Wes is running Safari also,\nright?\n\n594\n00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.020\nBut if I sort it, I don't see Wes here.\n\n595\n00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:20.360\nAnd that's because the activity monitor\nonly shows you, your stuff, by default.\n\n596\n00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:24.910\nBut, if I were to drop down to a terminal,\nIn the terminal\n\n597\n00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:30.470\nthere's a BSD command we can run, called,\nPS, that shows you all your processes.\n\n598\n00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:33.860\nAnd PS will show you,\nnot just yours, but everybody's,\n\n599\n00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:35.440\nif you give it the right modifier.\n\n600\n00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:40.270\nSo, if I do, sudo ps aux, right?\n\n601\n00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:41.710\nShow me all the users.\n\n602\n00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.090\nShow me what they're doing.\n\n603\n00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:46.200\nWhen I run that,\nI'm gonna see processes for everybody.\n\n604\n00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.220\nAnd it's a lot of stuff so let me filter\nthat cuz I just want to find Safari,\n\n605\n00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.740\nall right.\n\n606\n00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:56.780\nAnd when I do that, let's see Safari,\n\n607\n00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.610\nit must have a capital S,\nit returned by grep command,\n\n608\n00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:02.890\nmy search, that's the only command that\nit found, so let me try a capital S.\n\n609\n00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:04.680\nThere we go, that's a little better.\n\n610\n00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:09.720\nAnd so looking at this,\nI can see dpezet, process 7067.\n\n611\n00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.900\nAnd I can see wbryan,\nprocess 7023, and actually\n\n612\n00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:18.960\nit looks like I've got more than one\nSafari open right now for whatever reason.\n\n613\n00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.880\nTabs or updates or whatever.\n\n614\n00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.290\nSo, each of these are running\nas our identities.\n\n615\n00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:27.810\nSo when you log in, when you authenticate,\nthat's the first part.\n\n616\n00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:31.000\nBut then it's gotta authorize you,\nwhat are you authorized to do?\n\n617\n00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.740\nAnd every program you run is\nauthorized the same way you are.\n\n618\n00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.760\nAnd it's done by attaching\nthat ticket right there,\n\n619\n00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.120\nthat's how that process works.\n\n620\n00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.010\nSo I wanted to show you guys\nthat to be aware of it.\n\n621\n00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.910\nOn the exam,\nthere's two key terms to remember.\n\n622\n00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:48.010\nTicket granting ticket, I said it\nmore than once, that was important.\n\n623\n00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:51.410\nAnd then, KDC, key distribution center.\n\n624\n00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:55.210\nIf you have a Kerbero server,\nso an Open Directory,\n\n625\n00:32:55.210 --> 00:33:00.630\na Microsoft Active Directory, or even\nthe local directory service on your Mac,\n\n626\n00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:03.330\nit's what gives you\nthe ticket granting ticket.\n\n627\n00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:05.040\nIt's what gives you that key.\n\n628\n00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.600\nAnd so it's called\na Key Distribution Center, a KDC.\n\n629\n00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.680\nSo you're open directory,\nyour active directory,\n\n630\n00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:15.540\nand even your local user database\nare Key Distribution Centers, KDCs.\n\n631\n00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.730\nAnd they give you that ticket\ngranting ticket so you can go and\n\n632\n00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:19.090\nrun those applications.\n\n633\n00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:21.560\nIn real life,\nyou probably don't care about this at all.\n\n634\n00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.570\nBut it's kinda neat to understand\nthe process in the background and\n\n635\n00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:25.690\nhow that works and\nit's kinda neat to pass an exam,\n\n636\n00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.370\nbecause these questions\nare definitely gonna be on there,\n\n637\n00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.320\nso definitely something\nthat you wanna remember.\n\n638\n00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:33.520\n>> Lot of components, a lot of pieces\nto authentication and authorization.\n\n639\n00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.360\nDon, appreciate you opening the hood and\n\n640\n00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.400\nletting us take a look at\nthe engine behind the scene.\n\n641\n00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.750\nSo it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n642\n00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.570\nBut before we leave,\ngot any words of wisdom?\n\n643\n00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:44.320\nStudy, [LAUGH].\n\n644\n00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.010\nAll of this stuff is hidden\nbehind the scenes, right.\n\n645\n00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:48.420\nSo do exactly what I just did,\npoke around.\n\n646\n00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.342\nIt's hard to hurt anything, just don't\ndelete any files, you can poke around and\n\n647\n00:33:51.342 --> 00:33:52.060\ntry to look at them.\n\n648\n00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:55.456\nRemember that you will probably need to\nuse the Sudo command to get into a lot of\n\n649\n00:33:55.456 --> 00:33:57.296\nthe directives cuz they're protected.\n\n650\n00:33:57.296 --> 00:34:00.603\nAnd if you cheat like I did and do\nSudo.sh you can launch a route shell and\n\n651\n00:34:00.603 --> 00:34:03.821\nthen you can browse around and\nyou don't have to do the Sudo command.\n\n652\n00:34:03.821 --> 00:34:05.449\nDon't do that in regular practice,\n\n653\n00:34:05.449 --> 00:34:09.030\nthough cuz you can accidentally do some\ndamage when you are in that type of shell.\n\n654\n00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:10.660\nSo you always want to be careful there.\n\n655\n00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:12.190\n>> All right Don,\nthank you for joining us.\n\n656\n00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:14.350\nAnd thank you to our viewers for\njoining us out there.\n\n657\n00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:16.070\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off here at ITProTV.\n\n658\n00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.960\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n659\n00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.660\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n660\n00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:20.853\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n661\n00:34:20.853 --> 00:34:28.500\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.231\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode, we're going to be moving along in\n\n4\n00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:23.071\nour OSX server essentials and we got Mr.\nDon Pezet in the house to help us out.\n\n5\n00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:24.280\nDon, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n6\n00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.100\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n7\n00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.850\nReady to jump back into OSX and we're\ngonna be picking up this episode with\n\n8\n00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.220\na topic I mentioned a few\ntimes in the last episode.\n\n9\n00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.680\nIf you haven't watched it,\nour last episode,\n\n10\n00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.920\nwe talked about user authentication and\nthe ways that we can provide a username\n\n11\n00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.860\nand a password to Mac OS and\nget authenticated and get in the system.\n\n12\n00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.116\nWell, I mentioned\nApple's Open Directory more than once,\n\n13\n00:00:43.116 --> 00:00:45.530\nand didn't show it a single time,\nand you might be wondering why?\n\n14\n00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.330\nWell, the reason why is,\nwe got this whole episode, right here,\n\n15\n00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.610\non Apple's Open Directory.\n\n16\n00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.050\nWe're gonna see how to get it installed,\nup and running,\n\n17\n00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.600\nget some Macs joined to it, and using it.\n\n18\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.560\nIt's, actually, a pretty simple system.\n\n19\n00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.040\nThe set up, it does have some advanced\nfeatures that we need to be aware of,\n\n20\n00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.650\nthat can seem a little complex at first.\n\n21\n00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.670\nBut you'll see once we get into it,\nit's not that bad, and\n\n22\n00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.030\nit is a very reliable system.\n\n23\n00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.390\nSo that's what we're tackling right here,\nApple's Open Directory.\n\n24\n00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.070\nNow, the thing about Open Directory,\n\n25\n00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.170\nbefore I dive too deep into it, is that\nApple did not create it from scratch.\n\n26\n00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.630\nThis is actually built on an open\nsource product called OpenLDAP.\n\n27\n00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.840\nAnd Apple forked OpenLDAP.\n\n28\n00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.120\nAnd what forking means is, they basically\ntook all the code as it was written and\n\n29\n00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.230\nthen they made their own kinda branch,\n\n30\n00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.430\ntheir own set of changes to\nit that are Apple specific.\n\n31\n00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.880\nSo it's not a line for\nline clone of OpenLDAP.\n\n32\n00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.610\nIt's been modified.\n\n33\n00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.990\nIt's been modified to suit Apple's needs.\n\n34\n00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.200\nAnd on a negative side,\n\n35\n00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.170\nthat does mess with compatibility\na little bit with OpenLDAP, but\n\n36\n00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.890\non a positive side it means that we get a\nnice GUI that makes it easy to manage it,\n\n37\n00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.590\nas opposed to a bunch of text based config\nfiles you normally have with OpenLDAP.\n\n38\n00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.310\nOpenLDAP is not the easiest to configure,\n\n39\n00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.890\nyou will see here in this show that Open\nDirectory is, pretty easy to configure and\n\n40\n00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.680\nget up and running, all right.\n\n41\n00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.530\nThe other thing to remember is\nwhy we even need Open Directory,\n\n42\n00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.390\nbecause I'm saying hey, we've got\nusernames and passwords in Open Directory.\n\n43\n00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.310\nI've got usernames and\npasswords right here on my own computer.\n\n44\n00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.630\nWhy do I need some other server\nto provide that function.\n\n45\n00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.440\nIf you're an individual user\nwith your own laptop, or\n\n46\n00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.370\nif you're a small office, a home, right?\n\n47\n00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.940\nYou probably don't need Open Directory,\nmost people don't.\n\n48\n00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.994\nBut if you've got ten users,\n100 users, 1,000, 5,000, 50,000 users.\n\n49\n00:02:28.994 --> 00:02:30.980\nYou really need Open Directory.\n\n50\n00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.760\nAnd let me explain the main\nproblem that it solves.\n\n51\n00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.950\nBy default, user accounts\nare present on a single computer.\n\n52\n00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.530\nSo, if I sit down at my computer,\nand I go into my System Preferences,\n\n53\n00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.530\nI go to users and groups,\nand I add a user.\n\n54\n00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.070\nThat's just on my computer.\n\n55\n00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.650\nOn my laptop.\n\n56\n00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.070\nWes has his laptop.\n\n57\n00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.110\nIf he creates user accounts right there on\nhis laptop, and then if I have some kind\n\n58\n00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.730\nof network device sharing a folder\nuser accounts are on that device.\n\n59\n00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.310\nThe user account on my computer\nwon't work on that other computer.\n\n60\n00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.970\nDoesn't exist there.\n\n61\n00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.340\nI would have to create it again.\n\n62\n00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.050\nI would have to create\nmy user account over and\n\n63\n00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.710\nover again on every computer that\nI wanted access via the network.\n\n64\n00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.270\nYou can do that, it's a lot of work,\nbut you can do it.\n\n65\n00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.870\nAnd then if I ever wanted to change my\npassword, I have to go to every one of\n\n66\n00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.920\nthose computers and change the password,\nbecause they are separate accounts.\n\n67\n00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.110\nIf your a home user with two\ncomputers that's not a big deal.\n\n68\n00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.830\nIf it's just you and\nyour own laptop it's not a big deal.\n\n69\n00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.731\nBut if you have a 1,000 computers or\n\n70\n00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:28.230\n50,000 computers,\nyou don't want to do that, right?\n\n71\n00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.580\nEvery year, maybe you work at a school and\nevery year you get 20,000 new students.\n\n72\n00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.300\nAnd so you've got to go to all\nthe computers in your entire school and\n\n73\n00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.570\nadd 20,000 new accounts.\n\n74\n00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.250\nYou don't want to do that.\n\n75\n00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.040\nSo what Open Directory does is it gives\nus a central database of user accounts.\n\n76\n00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.490\nI put the user accounts in\nthat one central location.\n\n77\n00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.690\nAnd now every computer can use them.\n\n78\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.030\nAnd if I want to change my password I just\nchange it in that central location, and\n\n79\n00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.620\nnow it's changed everywhere because\nit doesn't actually exist everywhere.\n\n80\n00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.030\nWhen somebody logs in,\n\n81\n00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.700\nthe computers are all reaching\nback to that central database.\n\n82\n00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.510\nYou've got one place to go.\n\n83\n00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.840\nThat's the glory of having\na central directory.\n\n84\n00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.250\nNow, Apple's not really\nparticular about this.\n\n85\n00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.300\nThey want you to have a directory.\n\n86\n00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.260\nYou can use theirs, that's great, but they\ndon't care, you can use somebody's elses.\n\n87\n00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.740\nThe most common one is Microsoft's\nActive Directory, and I know, Apple and\n\n88\n00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.030\nMicrosoft don't always get along,\nbut in the business world,\n\n89\n00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.190\nMicrosoft's Active Directory is the number\none directory service that's out there,\n\n90\n00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.800\nand Apple devices will play nice with it.\n\n91\n00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.370\nYou can take a Mac OS machine and\njoin it to a Microsoft Active Directory.\n\n92\n00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.610\nBut if you don't want to deal with the\nwhole Microsoft mess, you don't have to.\n\n93\n00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.910\nApple's Open Directory\nfits the bill perfectly.\n\n94\n00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.890\nYou can get it deployed, and\nnow you've got that central database.\n\n95\n00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.560\n>> Don, when it comes to Open Directory,\n\n96\n00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.420\nI understand that we have\nsome main components, right.\n\n97\n00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.100\nWe have the meat and potatoes,\nor if you're vegetarian,\n\n98\n00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.175\nmaybe just the potatoes.\n\n99\n00:04:47.175 --> 00:04:50.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What are the main things that we can\n\n100\n00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.520\nsee inside of Open Directory?\n\n101\n00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.340\n>> All right so, there's OpenLDAP.\n\n102\n00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.565\nWhich is the lightweight\ndirectory access protocol.\n\n103\n00:04:57.565 --> 00:04:59.940\nOpenLDAP is how we talk to the database.\n\n104\n00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.050\nNormally your computer expects\nthe database to be right there\n\n105\n00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.770\non your file system.\n\n106\n00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.080\nI showed it in the last episode right?\n\n107\n00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.880\nIn /var/db/OpenLDAP.\n\n108\n00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.730\nIt just looked for a file.\n\n109\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.010\nBut with Open Directory,\nits got to look on the network.\n\n110\n00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.910\nAnd its got to reach out to this remote\nserver and its got to talk to it a certain\n\n111\n00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.020\nway, and OpenLDAP it what does that,\nso that's one piece.\n\n112\n00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.100\nKerberos, that is an authentication\nprotocol, that we can use\n\n113\n00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.210\nto send passwords and retrieve yes or\nno's as to whether those are valid.\n\n114\n00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.710\nSo it's a way of handling authentication,\nso Kerberos is another piece.\n\n115\n00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.260\nAnd then lastly,\nthe password server itself.\n\n116\n00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.010\nAnd the password server is\nyour Open Directory server,\n\n117\n00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.040\nwhichever one you bring up.\n\n118\n00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.920\nAnd odds are you'll want\nto bring up more than one.\n\n119\n00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.000\nBecause what happens if\nthe password server goes down?\n\n120\n00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.090\nPeople can't log in.\n\n121\n00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.320\nPeople are locked out of their computers,\n\n122\n00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.000\nyou got a whole company of\npeople that can't work any more.\n\n123\n00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.660\nSo you'll probably want more than\none of these password servers.\n\n124\n00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.068\nAnd each one of them,\nwe talk to it with OpenLDAP and\n\n125\n00:05:54.068 --> 00:05:56.800\nwe use Kerberos to\nauthenticate against it.\n\n126\n00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.340\nAll of that is done for\nus automatically in Open Directory.\n\n127\n00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.170\nWe don't have to set up\nthe individual pieces.\n\n128\n00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.400\nIt's done for us.\n\n129\n00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.620\nBut each one is kind of a moving\ncomponent of what we've gotta have.\n\n130\n00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.400\nNow if you take a Mac and\nyou install the sever app,\n\n131\n00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.970\nyou'll see that you've already\ngot users and groups present.\n\n132\n00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.960\nBut, that's not Open Directory.\n\n133\n00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.090\nLet me show you what I mean, right?\n\n134\n00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.790\nSo here I've got my server app,\nit's a brand new server,\n\n135\n00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.790\nI've just fired it up and\nI'm running no services.\n\n136\n00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.610\nIf I look down the list here,\nno services are lit up.\n\n137\n00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.400\nBut, I've got users and groups right here.\n\n138\n00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.750\nOkay, I can go into users and\nI'll create a new user.\n\n139\n00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.300\nSo I'm going to go down here and\nhit the plus sign,\n\n140\n00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.770\nand I'm going to create a user account for\nWes Bryan.\n\n141\n00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.500\nAll right.\n\n142\n00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.290\nIt's just asking me for\na full name, a username.\n\n143\n00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.870\nI'll make it wbryan.\n\n144\n00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.420\nAn email address.\n\n145\n00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.160\nI can put that in there.\n\n146\n00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.680\nWhat his password is going to be.\n\n147\n00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.790\nWell what is all this?\n\n148\n00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.243\nThis is just a regular local data base.\n\n149\n00:06:56.243 --> 00:07:00.020\nThe local LDAP database that Apple\nuses for storing user accounts.\n\n150\n00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.610\nWe saw it in last episode.\n\n151\n00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.880\nSo that's all this is.\n\n152\n00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.544\nI can pick whether I want them to\nbe an administrator or not, but\n\n153\n00:07:05.544 --> 00:07:08.650\nother wise there's not a whole heck\nof a lot of option here, okay.\n\n154\n00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.810\nI do have one option\nhere under Home Folder.\n\n155\n00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.410\nI can set it to local only or\nservices only.\n\n156\n00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.790\nLocal only means that he'll have a home\ndirectory right here on this server.\n\n157\n00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.460\nHe can log in and he'll have it.\n\n158\n00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.850\nNone, means that he can only access\nthis server over the network, but\n\n159\n00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.810\nthe user account still exists right here.\n\n160\n00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:25.740\nOkay.\n\n161\n00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.360\nThis kind of looks like a network account.\n\n162\n00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.060\nIt kind of looks like Open Directory,\nbut it isn't.\n\n163\n00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.710\nThis is not a true Open Directory.\n\n164\n00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.580\nIt's not something that\nsomebody can bind to.\n\n165\n00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.520\nIt's just a remote account.\n\n166\n00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.350\nSomebody is not allowed to log\nin locally on the machine.\n\n167\n00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.770\nSo when I create that, that's just\ngoing into the regular user database.\n\n168\n00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.472\nAnd that's it.\nSame thing goes for the groups.\n\n169\n00:07:45.472 --> 00:07:50.424\nIf I go in here and create some\nnew groups, I'll create a group\n\n170\n00:07:50.424 --> 00:07:55.197\ncalled Students and\nI'll create a group called Teachers.\n\n171\n00:07:55.197 --> 00:07:59.632\nWhen I create these groups, these\nare just standard, local groups, right?\n\n172\n00:07:59.632 --> 00:08:03.357\nNow anything that is being stored on the\nnetwork or anything like that definitely\n\n173\n00:08:03.357 --> 00:08:05.999\nnot being shared,\nit shows right here on my own machine.\n\n174\n00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:06.557\nOkay.\n\n175\n00:08:06.557 --> 00:08:10.568\nIf I wanna create a central database,\na central repository,\n\n176\n00:08:10.568 --> 00:08:12.891\nI need to create an open directory.\n\n177\n00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:17.965\nAnd by default, these two entries\nare not an open directory, all right?\n\n178\n00:08:17.965 --> 00:08:22.002\nBut when I turn on the open directory,\nthese will change and\n\n179\n00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:26.606\nthey will be both local and\nopen directory kind of merged together,\n\n180\n00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:30.750\ngets a little confusing but\nwe will see that in just a minute.\n\n181\n00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.131\nIf I want to turn on open directory,\n\n182\n00:08:32.131 --> 00:08:34.255\nyou might notice it is missing\nfrom the menu over here.\n\n183\n00:08:34.255 --> 00:08:37.944\nIt's not under the standard services,\nit's under the advanced services, so\n\n184\n00:08:37.944 --> 00:08:41.312\nif I go down under the advanced,\nwe can find open directory right there.\n\n185\n00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:45.921\nAnd boy does it have a massive\nlist of configuration options.\n\n186\n00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:48.254\nIt's got an on switch.\n\n187\n00:08:48.254 --> 00:08:49.010\nAnd that's it, right?\n\n188\n00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:49.572\nThe reason is,\n\n189\n00:08:49.572 --> 00:08:52.576\nit actually does have more configuration\noptions than any of the other services.\n\n190\n00:08:52.576 --> 00:08:56.976\nSo many, that Apple said we can't\njust make it radio buttons.\n\n191\n00:08:56.976 --> 00:08:58.892\nWe need a wizard for this one.\n\n192\n00:08:58.892 --> 00:09:03.164\nSo when I turn it on, it's gonna\nlaunch the Open Directory wizard.\n\n193\n00:09:03.164 --> 00:09:05.731\nAnd now it's gonna ask\nme all the questions I\n\n194\n00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:08.308\nneed to answer to get\nOpen Directory set up.\n\n195\n00:09:08.308 --> 00:09:10.482\nSo at first,\nit looks like super mega-easy,\n\n196\n00:09:10.482 --> 00:09:13.178\nit's actually one of the harder\nones to get configured.\n\n197\n00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:16.726\n>> I was about to make a caveman\nreference until you explained that,\n\n198\n00:09:16.726 --> 00:09:19.058\nso apparently I wont make that reference.\n\n199\n00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:22.552\n>> Yeah some of the caching service\nthat you literally can't just hit on and\n\n200\n00:09:22.552 --> 00:09:23.650\nyou are done, right?\n\n201\n00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:24.997\nThis is not one of those.\n\n202\n00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:28.155\nWhen I hit on, it launches a wizard and\nask me what I wanna do.\n\n203\n00:09:28.155 --> 00:09:30.186\nAnd you'll see,\nI got three different choices here.\n\n204\n00:09:30.186 --> 00:09:34.779\nI can create a new Open Directory domain\nand if this is your first server,\n\n205\n00:09:34.779 --> 00:09:37.205\nthen yes, that's what you wanna do.\n\n206\n00:09:37.205 --> 00:09:40.383\nBut if you already have\nan Open Directory server,\n\n207\n00:09:40.383 --> 00:09:44.251\nyou can join an existing open\ndirectory domain as a replica.\n\n208\n00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:46.995\nRemember what I said,\nif your password server goes down,\n\n209\n00:09:46.995 --> 00:09:48.340\nwhat happens to your users?\n\n210\n00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.720\nThey take a snow day, right?\n\n211\n00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.951\nThey can't work.\n\n212\n00:09:51.951 --> 00:09:53.274\nCan't get logged into their machines.\n\n213\n00:09:53.274 --> 00:09:54.633\nThey're locked out, that would be bad.\n\n214\n00:09:54.633 --> 00:09:56.269\nWe need to have two.\n\n215\n00:09:56.269 --> 00:10:00.502\nSo, you create your first one and\nthen you come back and create one or\n\n216\n00:10:00.502 --> 00:10:03.780\nmore replicas and\nyou can get many, many replicas.\n\n217\n00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.386\nI forget what the actual upper limit\nis on it, it's pretty high though so\n\n218\n00:10:07.386 --> 00:10:10.887\nyou can have quite a few replicas,\nyou don't need that many, right?\n\n219\n00:10:10.887 --> 00:10:14.370\nReally even for larger organizations\nwith tens of thousands of employees.\n\n220\n00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.574\nUsually three or four Open Directory\nservers is more than enough.\n\n221\n00:10:17.574 --> 00:10:19.919\nSo, it is a rare day\nthat we go beyond that.\n\n222\n00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:22.740\n>> The replicas themselves Don,\nI'm just kinda wondering this.\n\n223\n00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.088\nAre they read only?\n\n224\n00:10:24.088 --> 00:10:27.175\nDo they can hold a read only\nversion of the database?\n\n225\n00:10:27.175 --> 00:10:29.265\n>> Yeah, they're absolutely read only.\n\n226\n00:10:29.265 --> 00:10:33.758\nSo what happens is you have your\nmain directory server, the primary.\n\n227\n00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:36.590\nAnd you can make changes to\nit until the cows come home.\n\n228\n00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.913\nYou can add things, remove things,\nyou can read from it.\n\n229\n00:10:38.913 --> 00:10:42.140\nAnything that you change,\ngets copied into the replicas.\n\n230\n00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.229\nAnd the replicas,\nit's a one way replication.\n\n231\n00:10:45.229 --> 00:10:47.725\nIn other words,\nyou cannot make a change on the replica.\n\n232\n00:10:47.725 --> 00:10:49.560\nIt wouldn't replicate back to the primary.\n\n233\n00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.257\nSo the replicas are just copies, and when\npeople authenticated, just logging in,\n\n234\n00:10:54.257 --> 00:10:56.717\nthey can authenticate against any of them.\n\n235\n00:10:56.717 --> 00:10:58.366\nThe primary or the replicas.\n\n236\n00:10:58.366 --> 00:11:00.429\nBut if you wanna reset a password or\n\n237\n00:11:00.429 --> 00:11:04.143\ncreate a new user account that\nhas to be done from the primary.\n\n238\n00:11:04.143 --> 00:11:06.929\nAnd if the primary fails\nyou have got two choices,\n\n239\n00:11:06.929 --> 00:11:10.323\none you can restore the primary and\nget it back online again.\n\n240\n00:11:10.323 --> 00:11:15.901\nOr two, you can take one of your replicas,\nand promote it to become the primary.\n\n241\n00:11:15.901 --> 00:11:16.825\nAnd when you promote it,\n\n242\n00:11:16.825 --> 00:11:19.730\nall it's really doing is saying,\nyou're allowed to write to this one now.\n\n243\n00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.412\nThis is the new primary, right?\n\n244\n00:11:21.412 --> 00:11:23.927\nSo, you can usually promote that replica\nup and you don't have to restore anything.\n\n245\n00:11:23.927 --> 00:11:25.506\nThat's kinda the best way to do it.\n\n246\n00:11:25.506 --> 00:11:27.480\n>> Now you've mentioned, and\nI know this is an Apple show, but\n\n247\n00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.239\nyou've mentioned\nMicrosoft's Active Directory.\n\n248\n00:11:29.239 --> 00:11:31.271\nSo, this is different\nthan Active Directory.\n\n249\n00:11:31.271 --> 00:11:34.131\nSo, this is more of a single\nmaster of operations,\n\n250\n00:11:34.131 --> 00:11:36.200\nversus like multiple replication.\n\n251\n00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.173\n>> Yeah, in Active Directory,\nyou have that multi-master model.\n\n252\n00:11:39.173 --> 00:11:40.798\nSo, you can write to any of them.\n\n253\n00:11:40.798 --> 00:11:42.992\nAnd that's fine for what they use it for.\n\n254\n00:11:42.992 --> 00:11:46.791\nBut for most environments, this type\nsolution works perfectly fine and\n\n255\n00:11:46.791 --> 00:11:48.976\nit's part of how open OpenLDAP is built.\n\n256\n00:11:48.976 --> 00:11:52.845\nAll right so, I can create a new domain,\nI can join a domain, or\n\n257\n00:11:52.845 --> 00:11:56.290\nI can restore an Open Directory\ndomain from an archive.\n\n258\n00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.511\nSo if I had a backup and\nI needed to restore it,\n\n259\n00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:00.220\nthat's where I would go and do it.\n\n260\n00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.908\nSo I mentioned you would get\nkind of restores at that,\n\n261\n00:12:01.908 --> 00:12:03.006\nthat's the option we'd choose.\n\n262\n00:12:03.006 --> 00:12:07.437\nWell this is my first server, so I'm gonna\ncreate a new Open Directory domain and\n\n263\n00:12:07.437 --> 00:12:09.011\nI'll just hit next on that.\n\n264\n00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:11.286\nNow, it's gonna ask some questions.\n\n265\n00:12:11.286 --> 00:12:15.968\nIt's gonna have to create a user\naccount that's an administrator for\n\n266\n00:12:15.968 --> 00:12:17.406\nthe Open Directory.\n\n267\n00:12:17.406 --> 00:12:19.008\nIt's gonna give it a name.\n\n268\n00:12:19.008 --> 00:12:21.147\nThe default name is\nDirectory Administrator and\n\n269\n00:12:21.147 --> 00:12:22.352\nthe user name is diradmin.\n\n270\n00:12:22.352 --> 00:12:27.422\nYou can leave it that way or you can\nmodify it, change it, whatever you want.\n\n271\n00:12:27.422 --> 00:12:30.488\nBut the point is you do have to have\nat least one administrator account.\n\n272\n00:12:30.488 --> 00:12:32.100\nNow, I've already got\nan administrator account.\n\n273\n00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:32.797\nI'm D.\n\n274\n00:12:32.797 --> 00:12:34.888\nPezet, represent.\n\n275\n00:12:34.888 --> 00:12:36.246\nSo, it's telling you that's who I am.\n\n276\n00:12:36.246 --> 00:12:37.082\nI'm an administrator.\n\n277\n00:12:37.082 --> 00:12:41.331\nBut I'm an administrator on this machine,\nnot necessarily in the directory.\n\n278\n00:12:41.331 --> 00:12:45.744\nSo, here's my chance to create an account\nthat will be an admin in the directory.\n\n279\n00:12:45.744 --> 00:12:47.549\nAnd I can punch in a password, and\n\n280\n00:12:47.549 --> 00:12:51.561\nwe can even store that in our key chain\nif that's what we want, all right?\n\n281\n00:12:51.561 --> 00:12:54.428\nThen, it's gonna ask me for\nan organization name.\n\n282\n00:12:54.428 --> 00:12:57.188\nThis is just what our directory\nis gonna be called and\n\n283\n00:12:57.188 --> 00:13:00.402\nyou want this to be something\nyour end users will recognize.\n\n284\n00:13:00.402 --> 00:13:02.700\nThey'll see this, so\nthis is how they'll identify that.\n\n285\n00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:07.020\nSo, I might call mine ITProTV or\nITProTV Lab or whatever.\n\n286\n00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.327\nBut I need to give it a name\nto represent the environment.\n\n287\n00:13:11.327 --> 00:13:14.021\nThen an email address.\n\n288\n00:13:14.021 --> 00:13:17.946\nIf a user needs support, if they get their\npassword wrong too many times, it'll\n\n289\n00:13:17.946 --> 00:13:22.004\ntell them to contact their help desk and\nthis is the address that'll be displayed.\n\n290\n00:13:22.004 --> 00:13:26.880\nSo, I might wanna put like\nsupport@itpro.tv or something like that.\n\n291\n00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.185\nIf I put my own, every time a user has\na problem, they can start emailing me.\n\n292\n00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:31.428\nAnd I don't wanna hear it from.\n\n293\n00:13:31.428 --> 00:13:33.320\nSo again,\nyou put whatever it is that you need.\n\n294\n00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.402\nI'm not going to do\nsupport@itpro.tv though\n\n295\n00:13:36.402 --> 00:13:40.881\nbecause I don't want them to get emails,\nso I'll just put no reply.\n\n296\n00:13:40.881 --> 00:13:42.204\n>> No support for you.\n\n297\n00:13:42.204 --> 00:13:43.725\n>> If you needed support\nyou're out of luck.\n\n298\n00:13:43.725 --> 00:13:47.259\nAll right, so now it's just gonna give\nyou a little summary of changes there and\n\n299\n00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:50.081\nI can hit setup and now it's going\nto create my Open Directory.\n\n300\n00:13:50.081 --> 00:13:53.936\nSince I'm a primary, there's not a whole\nheck of a lot to worry about, right?\n\n301\n00:13:53.936 --> 00:13:55.932\nIt's gonna basically build\nthis up from scratch.\n\n302\n00:13:55.932 --> 00:14:01.249\nIn the server app, it has a template\ndatabase that's basically empty.\n\n303\n00:14:01.249 --> 00:14:04.699\nSo, it's just copying that template\ndatabase over and then it's creating that\n\n304\n00:14:04.699 --> 00:14:08.417\ndiradmin account and sticking it there and\nthen it's setting some file permissions.\n\n305\n00:14:08.417 --> 00:14:11.935\nOnce it's done,\nI'm now an Open Directory server.\n\n306\n00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:13.006\nNow, what it doesn't tell is,\n\n307\n00:14:13.006 --> 00:14:14.963\nis there are some other things\ngoing on in the background.\n\n308\n00:14:14.963 --> 00:14:17.807\nSee where it says,\nCreating an Open Directory master?\n\n309\n00:14:17.807 --> 00:14:19.363\nIt's doing a little bit more.\n\n310\n00:14:19.363 --> 00:14:22.862\nIf you watched our certificate episodes,\nwe talked about certificate authorities.\n\n311\n00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:25.414\nIf I haven't' configured any of that,\n\n312\n00:14:25.414 --> 00:14:30.453\nwhen I become an Open Directory server,\nit's turning me into a root CA, also.\n\n313\n00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:34.652\nIt's creating a public key infrastructure,\nso it can issue certificates.\n\n314\n00:14:34.652 --> 00:14:39.164\nRequires certificates to authenticate\nsystems to be able to send usernames and\n\n315\n00:14:39.164 --> 00:14:39.914\npasswords.\n\n316\n00:14:39.914 --> 00:14:43.177\nSo we need a central certificate\ndatabase for that, well,\n\n317\n00:14:43.177 --> 00:14:46.324\nthe Open Directory wizard\nconfigures all of that for us.\n\n318\n00:14:46.324 --> 00:14:50.115\nSo, it gets to a point in place\nwhen I'm acting as a CA and\n\n319\n00:14:50.115 --> 00:14:56.030\nanybody who connects to my Open Directory\nwill automatically trust my certificates.\n\n320\n00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.955\nAnd so, now I'm able to issue\nmy own internal certificates.\n\n321\n00:14:58.955 --> 00:15:00.354\nAnd do that without having to go out and\n\n322\n00:15:00.354 --> 00:15:02.162\npay some third party and\ndo all that crazy stuff.\n\n323\n00:15:02.162 --> 00:15:04.473\nOkay, but now that's done.\n\n324\n00:15:04.473 --> 00:15:07.920\nI'm up and running and\nI'm an Open Directory server.\n\n325\n00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.578\nNow my Open Directory, when it created it.\n\n326\n00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:12.971\nSee my server name?\n\n327\n00:15:12.971 --> 00:15:16.604\nOSX-SERVER01.local right?\n\n328\n00:15:16.604 --> 00:15:20.838\nIt's tied to this .local name because\nthat's the DNS name that my system had.\n\n329\n00:15:20.838 --> 00:15:23.078\nThat's only gonna be\ninternally resolvable.\n\n330\n00:15:23.078 --> 00:15:25.894\nIf I wanted this to be\nresolvable to the outside world,\n\n331\n00:15:25.894 --> 00:15:28.601\nI need to change my DNS\nfully qualified domain name.\n\n332\n00:15:28.601 --> 00:15:32.182\nMost people don't need to do this but\nif you want you just go up here to your\n\n333\n00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:34.667\nserver and\nyou've got your host name right here.\n\n334\n00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:38.165\nAnd you can edit that host name, and\nit's gonna run some quick checks,\n\n335\n00:15:38.165 --> 00:15:39.339\nand you can go through.\n\n336\n00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:41.699\nAnd you can change what\nthat domain name is, and\n\n337\n00:15:41.699 --> 00:15:44.308\nyou can update your\nOpen Directory to reflect that.\n\n338\n00:15:44.308 --> 00:15:47.742\nIt's actually a little easier to do this\nbefore you create the Open Directory, so\n\n339\n00:15:47.742 --> 00:15:50.795\nit just creates it with a right domain,\nfrom the very beginning, okay?\n\n340\n00:15:50.795 --> 00:15:52.758\nSo, you can change that if you need to.\n\n341\n00:15:52.758 --> 00:15:56.960\nBut for most people, you don't want your\nOpen Directory exposed to the internet.\n\n342\n00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.460\nRight.\n\n343\n00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.956\nWhat happens if a hacker breaks\ninto your open directory?\n\n344\n00:15:59.956 --> 00:16:01.830\nTechnically, they've got\naccess to your user accounts.\n\n345\n00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.840\nIt's very difficult to do but\nthat's the potential risk.\n\n346\n00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.090\nRight, so we don't want that to happen.\n\n347\n00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:11.070\nAll right, so once we've got this created,\nwe're now up and running.\n\n348\n00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.960\nWhat else do we need to do?\n\n349\n00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.120\nThere's still not a whole\nlot of options here.\n\n350\n00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.110\nI've got my servers.\n\n351\n00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.924\nRight, I've got one server and\nsee how my type is master,\n\n352\n00:16:18.924 --> 00:16:20.710\nI might wanna add more servers.\n\n353\n00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:24.950\nIf I wanna bring up another open directory\nserver, I could go to one of those,\n\n354\n00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.990\nlaunch the wizard and\nchoose to join a domain.\n\n355\n00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.980\nAnd point to this guy and joining it\nconnected so we can start to set it up and\n\n356\n00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.010\nthey would show up here as replicas.\n\n357\n00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.993\n>> Now you've kind of touched base on\na couple of these already Don, but\n\n358\n00:16:35.993 --> 00:16:38.925\nare there different with your servers\nare they different roles that\n\n359\n00:16:38.925 --> 00:16:40.350\nthey perform with the servers?\n\n360\n00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:44.960\nI know you've kind of mentioned things\nlike master, or excuse me, the primary and\n\n361\n00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.090\nreplica, but\nare there more than just those roles?\n\n362\n00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.740\n>> Yeah, so technically right now,\nI know it says master on the screen, but\n\n363\n00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.390\nthis is what Apple would\ndescribe as kind of a-.\n\n364\n00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:58.900\nThis would just be the master role, right?\n\n365\n00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.950\nAnd as I bring up replicas, those are the\nreplicas, of copies of this database.\n\n366\n00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:06.870\nThe other two roles that we deal\nwith are standalone and member.\n\n367\n00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:10.580\nA standalone, that's a server that's\nnot joined to the open directory.\n\n368\n00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:14.180\nSo for example, I've been doing\nit all right here on this server.\n\n369\n00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.630\nThis machine over here, this is my client.\n\n370\n00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.332\nAnd this is called a standalone.\n\n371\n00:17:18.332 --> 00:17:22.590\nA standalone is a system that only has\nlocal user accounts when I go to log into\n\n372\n00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:27.800\nthese only got local accounts I don't\nhave a connection to the open directory.\n\n373\n00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.160\nBut if I bind it to the open directory\nnow it becomes a member right.\n\n374\n00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.990\nThis is a member of open\na directory is not a master or\n\n375\n00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:39.600\nreplicate doesn't have a open directory\nit is just participating of it.\n\n376\n00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.820\nAnd the bind process is\nactually pretty easy.\n\n377\n00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.560\nLet me show you guys real quick.\n\n378\n00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:50.270\nIf I go into System Preferences, and you\nwould want to do this on all of your Macs,\n\n379\n00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:54.486\nso I can go into System Preferences,\nand Users & Groups, and\n\n380\n00:17:54.486 --> 00:17:58.400\ninside Users & Groups you've\ngot Login Options right here.\n\n381\n00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.950\nAnd under Login Options,\nyou see Network Account Server.\n\n382\n00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.030\nAnd right now, I'm not connected to\nanything, so it's got the Join button.\n\n383\n00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.210\nSo I'm a standalone system.\n\n384\n00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:09.430\nI only have local accounts.\n\n385\n00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.180\nBut, if I unlock that.\n\n386\n00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.735\nNow, I can join a network account server.\n\n387\n00:18:16.735 --> 00:18:17.660\nRight.\nAnd\n\n388\n00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.870\nthat network account server can\nbe an open directory server, or\n\n389\n00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.540\nit can be Microsoft's active directory,\nI can do either one.\n\n390\n00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:24.210\nRight?\n\n391\n00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.912\nAnd so\nI'm gonna put in here osx-server01.local.\n\n392\n00:18:27.912 --> 00:18:30.750\nAnd it's gonna reach out and\ntry to find that one.\n\n393\n00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:36.270\nThere we go and\nthis server provides SSL certificates.\n\n394\n00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:40.720\nDo you want to trust the certificates\nfrom osx-server01.local?\n\n395\n00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.670\nIt's become a CA, it's creative\npublic key infrastructure and\n\n396\n00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.480\ndo I trust that infrastructure and I do.\n\n397\n00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.840\nAnd so from now on,\nany certificate that server issues.\n\n398\n00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.390\nIs going to be trusted.\n\n399\n00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:54.040\nAnd it's not using itself for\nits actual connection here.\n\n400\n00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.280\nIt's warning you of that because\nI haven't gone and configured it.\n\n401\n00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.890\nI'll just continue pass that.\n\n402\n00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.630\nSo now it's connecting, and\n\n403\n00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:04.205\nwhat I see down here is instead of a Join\nbutton I see Network Account Server.\n\n404\n00:19:04.205 --> 00:19:06.810\nOsx-server01.local.\n\n405\n00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.150\nAnd I can edit it which is\nreally just me unjoining or\n\n406\n00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:10.515\nconnecting to other directories.\n\n407\n00:19:10.515 --> 00:19:11.500\nRight.\n\n408\n00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.800\nNow I'm a member, right?\n\n409\n00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.330\nI was standalone, all by myself.\n\n410\n00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:16.920\nNow I'm a member.\n\n411\n00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.950\nAnd when you're a member,\nyou have both local and network accounts.\n\n412\n00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.210\nYour local accounts don't disappear.\n\n413\n00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:23.720\nThey're still there.\n\n414\n00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.090\nBut now you've got local and networks.\n\n415\n00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.550\nThat's kind of a difference\nin those roles.\n\n416\n00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:34.680\nSo the four roles, we had standalone,\nmember, master, and replica.\n\n417\n00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.340\nThose are the four roles\nin the open directory.\n\n418\n00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:43.390\nAll right, so now that I am a master,\nwhat else do I need to configure here?\n\n419\n00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:49.320\nWell, the only other option I have right\nhere to configure are the locales.\n\n420\n00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.110\nIf I have more than one replica, and\nthey're in different geographical\n\n421\n00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:58.345\nlocations, I might want certain people\nto authenticate against certain servers.\n\n422\n00:19:58.345 --> 00:19:58.950\nRight?\n\n423\n00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:03.060\nThose are read only server, the replicas,\nbut people can still authenticate against\n\n424\n00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.170\nthem, as long as they're\nnot changing accounts.\n\n425\n00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.050\nSo what I have to do is I have to tie\n\n426\n00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.070\nthose server IP addresses to locales,\nright.\n\n427\n00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:12.340\nYou do it with subnets.\n\n428\n00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.010\nSo right now I just have one locale,\nall networks.\n\n429\n00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:16.930\nBut I can add another one.\n\n430\n00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:20.190\nSo I might have my Gainesville office,\nright?\n\n431\n00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:25.889\nAnd in the Gainesville office maybe\nI have the 192.168.0.0/24 network.\n\n432\n00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.840\nAnd maybe I have\nthe 192.168.1.0/24 network.\n\n433\n00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.260\nRight, so I'll get these two\ndifferent networks here.\n\n434\n00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:37.490\nAnd under servers,\nI'll pick OS X server one.\n\n435\n00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.575\nThat's the one that's gonna\nbe servicing Gainesville.\n\n436\n00:20:39.575 --> 00:20:40.280\nOkay?\n\n437\n00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.020\nAnd so I can come in here and create that.\n\n438\n00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.990\nAnd now I've got that first network.\n\n439\n00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.680\nRight?\n\n440\n00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.870\nAnd then I can add in another one and\nmaybe this one is Orlando.\n\n441\n00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:56.300\nAnd in Orlando I've got\nthe 192.168.2.0 network.\n\n442\n00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:02.890\nAnd I might have other servers that\nare ready to service Orlando, and\n\n443\n00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.870\nso I would hit add.\n\n444\n00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:07.660\nAnd I would pick the replicas\nthat were in Orlando.\n\n445\n00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.510\nI don't have any replicas here, but I\nwould pick the ones that were in Orlando.\n\n446\n00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:14.270\nAnd that way, any client who is in\nthis network, if your IP address\n\n447\n00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:19.070\nis 192.160.2 dot whatever, you would\nuse the servers that I picked here.\n\n448\n00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:22.030\nAnd that means a client could authenticate\nagainst a server if they're in the same\n\n449\n00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.470\nbuilding with them instead of\nhaving to cross the Internet and\n\n450\n00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:27.060\ncome all the way over here to\nauthenticate against the master.\n\n451\n00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.980\nNow if they go to reset their password,\nyeah they gotta come back to the master.\n\n452\n00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.520\nIf they wanna change some kind of user\n\n453\n00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.418\nsetting it's gotta come\nback to the master.\n\n454\n00:21:34.418 --> 00:21:38.290\nBut if there's just logging in, if they're\ndoing what they do all throughout the day,\n\n455\n00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:41.070\nthat'll happen off that local server\nthat will really prove performance.\n\n456\n00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.320\nThat's one of the things that\nwe might need to configure.\n\n457\n00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.250\nIf you got replicas.\n\n458\n00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:46.980\nIf you don't have replicas then\nthat's not gonna matter at all.\n\n459\n00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:47.980\nYou've only got one server.\n\n460\n00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.705\nEverybody's gonna use\nthe master no matter what.\n\n461\n00:21:49.705 --> 00:21:51.160\nRight.\n\n462\n00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.710\nBut also be prepared for downtime,\nin the event that your master fails.\n\n463\n00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:54.730\nYou want to have more than one.\n\n464\n00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.040\nAll right, that's about it for\n\n465\n00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.130\nconfiguration options on Open Directory,\nbut that's just the start.\n\n466\n00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.070\nI created the directory,\ntechnically it's empty,\n\n467\n00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:08.370\nit's only got one account, diradmin,\nnow I need to create network accounts.\n\n468\n00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.620\nAnd you don't do that from this screen,\nyou actually do it from the Users and\n\n469\n00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.020\nGroups options over here.\n\n470\n00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:16.440\nNow this screen doesn't look too much\ndifferent now, well it's a little bit\n\n471\n00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.350\ndifferent I have a little drop down\nbox up here that wasn't there before.\n\n472\n00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:24.110\nThis drop down box lets me filter\nbetween all users, local users, and\n\n473\n00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.560\nlocal network users.\n\n474\n00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.930\nAnd that's kind of a funny one.\n\n475\n00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:28.390\nLocal network users.\n\n476\n00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.800\nThese are network people,\nthey're out on the network.\n\n477\n00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.900\nBut they're local.\n\n478\n00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.070\nWhat the heck does that mean?\n\n479\n00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:38.590\nWell, the users are network users that are\nstored in a local open directory database.\n\n480\n00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.030\nI've got an open directory\ndatabase running on this server.\n\n481\n00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:43.240\nAnd that's where these network\naccounts are stored, right?\n\n482\n00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.190\nSo technically, they're network accounts.\n\n483\n00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:47.560\nBut they call them local networks\nbecause this is the master.\n\n484\n00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:51.630\nNow, when I create an account,\nfrom now on,\n\n485\n00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:55.090\nI've gotta pick whether it's\ngonna be local or network.\n\n486\n00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:58.730\nAnd see how Wes and I, we had accounts\nbefore, so we show up as local.\n\n487\n00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.380\nWell, I'm gonna delete Wes.\n\n488\n00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.700\nBecause he's just trouble anyway.\n\n489\n00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.980\nSo we'll get rid of him.\n\n490\n00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:08.480\nAnd this time, when I go and\ncreate Wes again, I can pick,\n\n491\n00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.210\nis it gonna be local or\nhe gonna be network?\n\n492\n00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:12.330\nAnd I'll pick network, right?\n\n493\n00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:14.550\nSo I'm gonna recreate Wes's account.\n\n494\n00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:19.790\nNow, when I deleted him technically\nhis home folder is still there.\n\n495\n00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:22.320\nIf I create an account with the same name.\n\n496\n00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.760\nIt will try and match up with the.\n\n497\n00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.630\nHe might not even know this has happened,\nbut\n\n498\n00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.060\ntechnically he's gonna have\na different user ID number.\n\n499\n00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.110\nHe's technically a different user account.\n\n500\n00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:32.820\nSo the permissions are probably\nhosted up on his home folder.\n\n501\n00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.900\nUsually a good idea to go and delete that.\n\n502\n00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.520\nBut since I never actually\nlogged in as you,\n\n503\n00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.570\nyou don't actually have a home folder,\nso it doesn't matter.\n\n504\n00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.590\nAll right, so I can come in and\npunch in this other information,\n\n505\n00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:42.540\nI'll give him a password.\n\n506\n00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:49.618\nAnd notice how it's not asking about\nApple IDs, like the other one did?\n\n507\n00:23:49.618 --> 00:23:51.696\nAnd it's because it's\nan open directory account.\n\n508\n00:23:51.696 --> 00:23:53.102\nIt knows it's not an Apple ID.\n\n509\n00:23:53.102 --> 00:23:55.682\nAnd so I can specify if I want you\nto be an administrator, or whatever.\n\n510\n00:23:55.682 --> 00:23:59.258\nEverything else here is basically\nthe same as what you'd expect to see.\n\n511\n00:23:59.258 --> 00:24:01.727\nYou know even these service only or\nlocal only options,\n\n512\n00:24:01.727 --> 00:24:03.780\nthey're all pretty much the same.\n\n513\n00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.870\nBut the difference is instead of creating\nthe account in our local security\n\n514\n00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:10.260\ndatabase, it's now making it\nin the open directory and so\n\n515\n00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:14.590\nI see that local network account,\nright, that you're showing up as.\n\n516\n00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:16.280\nAnd I can continue creating more accounts.\n\n517\n00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.930\nMaybe I want to create an account for\nRonny Wong.\n\n518\n00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:21.480\nOne of our other show hosts,\nso I'll give him an account.\n\n519\n00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.890\nAnd I'll do the same thing, just choosing\nthat local network directory and\n\n520\n00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:26.470\ngetting that put in place.\n\n521\n00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.960\nNow how do I actually know that they're\ngoing into the open directory because\n\n522\n00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.010\nthey're grouped right\nhere in the same folder.\n\n523\n00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:35.140\nSame thing with groups for that matter.\n\n524\n00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:41.370\nIf I go in and create some more groups\nlike administrative staff, right?\n\n525\n00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:44.820\nAnd so I make that a local\nnetwork directory group also.\n\n526\n00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.760\nSo how do I really know that's\ngoing in the open directory?\n\n527\n00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.240\nWell I can jump into my terminal, and\nwe can find it on the hard drive, right?\n\n528\n00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.170\nRemember where our local stuff\nwas versus our open directory?\n\n529\n00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:00.640\nThey're buried in that /var/db folder,\nright?\n\n530\n00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.836\nSo let me Cheat and\nget a root shell again.\n\n531\n00:25:05.836 --> 00:25:09.783\nProbably the worst security\nbreach that I do in these shows.\n\n532\n00:25:09.783 --> 00:25:14.625\nSo let me get into /var/db, and\nif I go into openldap, right,\n\n533\n00:25:14.625 --> 00:25:19.381\ninside of openldap,\nwe had openldap-data replication run,\n\n534\n00:25:19.381 --> 00:25:23.689\nopenldap-data Is where LDAP\ndatabase is being stored,\n\n535\n00:25:23.689 --> 00:25:28.802\nour open directory, and in the last\nshow when I brought this up there\n\n536\n00:25:28.802 --> 00:25:34.360\nwas only one file in there,\ndbconfig.example, but in this show?\n\n537\n00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.330\nThere's a lot in here, right?\n\n538\n00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:40.450\nI'm seeing security identities,\nconfigurations, group member GUIDs,\n\n539\n00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.320\nwe'll have users also.\n\n540\n00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.140\nAll of this stuff, this is the open\ndirectory right here it's all being\n\n541\n00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.010\npopulated and\nthis is where it's coming from.\n\n542\n00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:50.310\nNow these databases are encrypted,\nI can't open them.\n\n543\n00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:54.070\nI can't see them, so there's not really\nany way that I can verify that Wes and\n\n544\n00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:55.170\nRonnie are in here.\n\n545\n00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:58.540\nOther than the fact that\nthere is a database, right?\n\n546\n00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:02.718\nBut I can go and\nfind that local security database right,\n\n547\n00:26:02.718 --> 00:26:08.638\nwhere that was tucked away and I should\nsee that they're not present in that one,\n\n548\n00:26:08.638 --> 00:26:12.317\nthat they don't have the Plist file or\nwhatever.\n\n549\n00:26:12.317 --> 00:26:19.086\nFor example if I were to dive into\nthat we could hunt and find it.\n\n550\n00:26:19.086 --> 00:26:24.704\nSo I am just going to dslocal and\nthat is that local directory service.\n\n551\n00:26:24.704 --> 00:26:30.760\nAnd we can browse right into here and\nbrowse in old users and take a look.\n\n552\n00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:37.410\nAnd there's dpezet but\nI don't see wbrian or rwong.\n\n553\n00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:39.012\nThey're not in here, right?\n\n554\n00:26:39.012 --> 00:26:42.140\nAnd I should have the same\nresult with groups.\n\n555\n00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:47.850\nBut if I look inside of groups,\nthere's teachers and students and\n\n556\n00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:52.210\nwhere's administrative staff,\nno administrative staff, so\n\n557\n00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:54.440\nthey don't exist here\nin the local database.\n\n558\n00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.920\nThe only other place for\nthem is in the open directory.\n\n559\n00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.290\nAll right, and now that they're\nin place we can try it out.\n\n560\n00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:02.130\nSo, for example,\nthis Wes account is a network error, or\n\n561\n00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:05.230\nwe'll use Ronnie cuz I definitely haven't\nused Ronnie in any of the shows yet.\n\n562\n00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:06.100\nWe got Ronnie Wong here.\n\n563\n00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.600\nHe's a local network account.\n\n564\n00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:13.433\nMy work station over here,\nI'm bound to the open directory so\n\n565\n00:27:13.433 --> 00:27:17.256\nif I were to log out, I'll log out as me.\n\n566\n00:27:17.256 --> 00:27:19.280\nMy log in screen is gonna\nlook a little different.\n\n567\n00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.200\nYou know, your normal log in screen\nyou see icons for every user?\n\n568\n00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.880\nNow I see Other.\n\n569\n00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.860\nWhat the heck is Other?\n\n570\n00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.150\nThose are my network accounts.\n\n571\n00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.520\nAnd so you can go here and\nyou can punch in.\n\n572\n00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:34.360\nBut I'm gonna log in as rwong and\nwe'll put in his password.\n\n573\n00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.530\nWhich I think I know and\nthen we'll run it.\n\n574\n00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:38.020\nAnd what's happening is in the background,\n\n575\n00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.640\nthe system is saying,\nI don't have a user account called Rwong.\n\n576\n00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.390\nOtherwise, I would have\nshown a picture for it.\n\n577\n00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:46.250\nSo instead,\nI'm gonna take that user account, and\n\n578\n00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:49.240\nI'm gonna send it over to the open\ndirectory server and say,\n\n579\n00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.370\nhey, somebody just gave me this\nusername and password, is this valid?\n\n580\n00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:54.860\nAnd the server is gonna say,\nyeah, that's Ronnie.\n\n581\n00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:55.470\nRonnie's cool.\n\n582\n00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:56.460\nThat's the right password.\n\n583\n00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.420\nLet him in.\n\n584\n00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:03.092\nAnd then my computer is gonna say,\nokay, we'll go ahead and let them in,\n\n585\n00:28:03.092 --> 00:28:07.771\nand now he's able to access it and\ngain access to the system.\n\n586\n00:28:07.771 --> 00:28:10.760\nAnd now that we're logged in as Ronnie,\nthe system knows it's a network account.\n\n587\n00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.900\nIt's allowed us in and\nwe can see some kind of neat things.\n\n588\n00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.740\nLet me show you.\n\n589\n00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:17.730\nSo, Ronnie is not an admin but\nif I go into System Preferences and\n\n590\n00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.860\nI go into local users and groups right.\n\n591\n00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:23.020\nNormally when I go to users and\ngroups down here it is local.\n\n592\n00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:25.070\nBut he's logged in with\na network account and so\n\n593\n00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:28.610\nhe shows up, Ronnie Wong, Network, right?\n\n594\n00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:32.586\nYou see Don Pezet, Admin, that's my\nlocal account but Ronnie's logged in and\n\n595\n00:28:32.586 --> 00:28:36.322\nit shows him as a network user and he's\ngot a home directory he can come in and\n\n596\n00:28:36.322 --> 00:28:39.015\nstart creating things in his documents or\nwhatever.\n\n597\n00:28:39.015 --> 00:28:44.037\nSo if he fires up good old text edit and\ncreates some kind of file,\n\n598\n00:28:44.037 --> 00:28:48.340\nand saves it,\nI'll just call it untitled there.\n\n599\n00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.690\nSo that's going in his home directory,\nright?\n\n600\n00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.830\nWell, if I log out as Ronnie, and\n\n601\n00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:58.170\nI'll log in as me this time, now I've got\na local account, not a directory account.\n\n602\n00:28:58.170 --> 00:28:59.880\nSo I'm logging in here as a local one.\n\n603\n00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.930\nThat's why I was able to\nclick my icon right there.\n\n604\n00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:07.240\nAnd when I go into system preferences and\n\n605\n00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.940\nI go into local users and groups\nright here in that system preference.\n\n606\n00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.670\nRonnie doesn't show up.\n\n607\n00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:14.630\nI'm an admin.\n\n608\n00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.190\nWhy can't I see Ronnie?\n\n609\n00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:20.884\nWell, the reason is, your directory\nmight have 10,000 users in it.\n\n610\n00:29:20.884 --> 00:29:22.957\nIt might have 50,000 users in it.\n\n611\n00:29:22.957 --> 00:29:26.320\nI don't wanna see 50,000 users\nin this little tiny list.\n\n612\n00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:30.590\nAnd so, it's only gonna show me people\nthat are actively logged in right now.\n\n613\n00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.020\nNow, what happened to Ronnie's stuff?\n\n614\n00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:33.890\nRonnie logged out.\n\n615\n00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:35.050\nHis account's gone, right?\n\n616\n00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:36.135\nDid it delete it?\n\n617\n00:29:36.135 --> 00:29:40.630\nNo he still has a home directory,\nit just doesn't stay populated in there.\n\n618\n00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:46.120\nBecause, well, because we don't want\n50,000 users in the list, right?\n\n619\n00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:51.120\nSo, if I go into /Users and take a look,\nI guess that's a little hard to see but\n\n620\n00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.850\nyou can see Ronnie Wong still\nhas a folder right there.\n\n621\n00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:59.130\nAnd If I,\nkinda break into his directory and\n\n622\n00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.990\nstart to look, I can get into Documents.\n\n623\n00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:06.180\nAnd there's that Untitled.rtf, the file\nis still right there, waiting for him.\n\n624\n00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:10.560\nSo the next time he logs in, even though\nhe disappeared from that user list,\n\n625\n00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.950\nhe still has his account,\nhis files, his folders, whatever,\n\n626\n00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:16.770\nthey're all waiting right\nthere on the hard drive.\n\n627\n00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:19.230\nAnd only people that have logged\nin will have a home directory.\n\n628\n00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:22.706\nThat tens of 1000's of other users who\nhave logged in wont have a home directory.\n\n629\n00:30:22.706 --> 00:30:27.546\nMy system effectively ignores them,\nnow I know I'm running short on time but\n\n630\n00:30:27.546 --> 00:30:32.472\nthe last thing I wanna touch on is backing\nup and restoring the open directory.\n\n631\n00:30:32.472 --> 00:30:38.068\nThe first and most important thing I can\ntell you is don't use time machine to\n\n632\n00:30:38.068 --> 00:30:43.380\nrestore open directory, time machine\nis bad news but, not normally.\n\n633\n00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:47.610\nTommy, she's awesome normally, but\nopen directory uses Kerberos, and\n\n634\n00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:51.480\nKerberos relies on\ntime-based authentication.\n\n635\n00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.860\nEverything has timers.\n\n636\n00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.970\nThe trust relationships between your\nworkstations and your servers, the user\n\n637\n00:30:55.970 --> 00:31:00.130\naccounts, their passwords, the tickets\nthat are generated, everything has a clock\n\n638\n00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:05.720\nassociated with it and when you restore\na time machine backup, what happens?\n\n639\n00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.014\nYou're going back in time.\n\n640\n00:31:07.014 --> 00:31:08.483\nAnd when you go back in time,\n\n641\n00:31:08.483 --> 00:31:11.920\nKerberos assumes you're\ntrying to perform an attack.\n\n642\n00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.800\nThey assume that you're trying to\nretransmit authentication messages from\n\n643\n00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.870\na previous sessions that\nyou've recorded them and\n\n644\n00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:20.430\nyou're retransmitting and\nthose get blocked.\n\n645\n00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.630\nIf you restore Open Directory\nfrom a time machine backup\n\n646\n00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:25.810\nIt'll hose things up pretty good right?\n\n647\n00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:27.610\nTo get it to work,\n\n648\n00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:31.910\nyou would have to restore every machine,\nfrom a time machine backup from\n\n649\n00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:36.430\nthe same time to really get it all in sync\notherwise it hoses things up pretty bad.\n\n650\n00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:40.520\nYou have to un join all your machines from\nthe open directory and rejoin them again.\n\n651\n00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.731\nSo, a mess, so Instead,\n\n652\n00:31:42.731 --> 00:31:48.373\nopen directory has it's own\nbuilt-in system for managing this.\n\n653\n00:31:48.373 --> 00:31:53.574\nApple's official recommendation is\ndon't even back up the open directory.\n\n654\n00:31:53.574 --> 00:31:55.409\nInstead you should use replicas.\n\n655\n00:31:55.409 --> 00:31:59.903\nAnd that way, if your primary, dies\nyou can just promote a replica, right.\n\n656\n00:31:59.903 --> 00:32:02.540\nPromote a replica up, and now and\nit's the new primary and you're done.\n\n657\n00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:03.640\nIf you have more than one server and\n\n658\n00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:07.240\none server gets hosed, you just bring up\nthe other one, right, problem solved.\n\n659\n00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.230\nWell, that's actually\na pretty easy process.\n\n660\n00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:11.600\nSo I'm in the server app here.\n\n661\n00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.058\nAnd if I go down to Open Directory and\nI look at my servers,\n\n662\n00:32:14.058 --> 00:32:17.710\nyou'll see all of your servers here, your\nmaster, and then any replicas you have.\n\n663\n00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:22.900\nAssuming your master is down,\nyou can choose a replica, and\n\n664\n00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:27.030\nin the gear icon here,\nyou'll see Promote Replica to Master.\n\n665\n00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:29.890\nAnd so you can bump it up to become\na master and now you're back up and\n\n666\n00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:31.045\nrunning again.\n\n667\n00:32:31.045 --> 00:32:35.800\nOkay, if you do that, you should\nnever bring up the old master again.\n\n668\n00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:41.820\nJust format the old master, bring it\nup as a clean machine and rejoin it.\n\n669\n00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.870\nRun the Open Directory wizard, and\nsay create this as a replica and\n\n670\n00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:46.860\nbring it back up that way, okay?\n\n671\n00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:50.030\nYou never want a situation where\nyou have two masters online, right?\n\n672\n00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:53.250\nThat'll really break the Open Directory\ntoo and is bad news.\n\n673\n00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:56.790\nSo quick and easy to promote it, but\n\n674\n00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:01.280\nif you've only got one server,\nyou need to make a backup of it.\n\n675\n00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.510\nTime Machine will mess things up,\nyou don't have a replica, and so\n\n676\n00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:07.200\nyou can Archive the Open Directory Master.\n\n677\n00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.650\nThe only negative about this\nis you have to do it by hand.\n\n678\n00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.280\nIt's not like Time Machine\nwhere it runs every hour.\n\n679\n00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.960\nI have to come in and do it myself.\n\n680\n00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:17.700\nAnd so, once a day, once a week, once a\nmonth, however often I feel is necessary,\n\n681\n00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.280\nI can come in and\ngenerate an archive, all right?\n\n682\n00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.700\nAnd then when this server gets toasted and\n\n683\n00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:26.470\ndestroyed, I can bring\nup an all new server.\n\n684\n00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:28.240\nAnd when I run the Open Directory wizard,\n\n685\n00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.500\nyou will remember that was\nthe third option in that list was\n\n686\n00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.330\nRestore Open Directory from an Archive,\nand I would provide this file right here.\n\n687\n00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:37.440\nThe archive file is not a big deal, right?\n\n688\n00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:41.900\nYou tell it you're gonna create one, you\ndo need to be an administrator to do it.\n\n689\n00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.170\nAnd then it's gonna ask\nyou to create a file.\n\n690\n00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:47.090\nAnd so I'll create a file here,\nI'll just stick it on my desktop.\n\n691\n00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.590\nAnd I'm gonna call this my open directory.\n\n692\n00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:55.510\nAnd I usually stick a date on it,\nso it's 0427 of 2016.\n\n693\n00:33:55.510 --> 00:34:01.430\nAnd we'll pop it right there.\n\n694\n00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:04.334\nAnd you do need to stick a password on it\nbecause if somebody gets this archive,\n\n695\n00:34:04.334 --> 00:34:05.620\nwhat do they have?\n\n696\n00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.480\nAll your users and passwords.\n\n697\n00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.570\nIt's encrypted, but they could\nthen take their time and try and\n\n698\n00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:11.970\nbrute force it all and\nfigure out what those passwords are.\n\n699\n00:34:11.970 --> 00:34:14.830\nSo we want to make sure we\nstick a password on it.\n\n700\n00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:17.180\nSo, of course, I'll do password,\nall lowercase.\n\n701\n00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:21.940\n[LAUGH] Password123, and\nthen we can generate that archive, okay?\n\n702\n00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.100\nAnd so it's gonna build\nan archive of my Open Directory.\n\n703\n00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:29.000\nAnd now I can go to any other box,\nrun the Open Directory wizard and\n\n704\n00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.400\nchoose to restore\nthe Open Directory from an archive.\n\n705\n00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.880\nBut if you have even one replica,\nyou shouldn't do this.\n\n706\n00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.298\nIf you had just one replica,\nyou could just promote that replica and\n\n707\n00:34:37.298 --> 00:34:39.840\nit becomes the master and now you're back\nin business, you didn't lose any data.\n\n708\n00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.520\nThat's the way to really handle it,\nthat's the best way to go.\n\n709\n00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:46.436\nBut the archive functionality is right\nthere, I've now got an archive right here.\n\n710\n00:34:46.436 --> 00:34:50.170\nYou'll see it, it built like a DMG,\na sparse image.\n\n711\n00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:52.180\nAnd you can mount that and open it up and\n\n712\n00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:55.830\nsee what's inside of it if you have\nthe password, right, cuz it's encrypted.\n\n713\n00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:59.390\nAnd so that's gonna open up, and\nhere's my LDAP backup, right?\n\n714\n00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:03.510\nSo, I can see the backup.ldif and\nmy dslocal, and\n\n715\n00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:07.430\nmy certificates, openldap, all that stuff,\ntucked away right in here.\n\n716\n00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:10.170\nThere's my Kerberos 5 backup, and so on.\n\n717\n00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:12.850\nAll the data needed to\nrestore that Open Directory,\n\n718\n00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:14.781\nall tucked right here\ninside of that archive.\n\n719\n00:35:14.781 --> 00:35:21.810\nAll right, so just remember Time Machine\nplus Open Directory equals bad, right?\n\n720\n00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:26.560\nEverything else, all the other server\napp stuff is fine, but Kerberos is so\n\n721\n00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.840\ntied to time that if you roll it\nback in time, it breaks things.\n\n722\n00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:35.220\nSo use the archive functionality in\nthe server app or have a replica.\n\n723\n00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.960\nA replica is better,\nthat's the number one option.\n\n724\n00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.660\nOn the exam, if you get more than\none choice, having a replica and\n\n725\n00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.070\npromoting that, that's the best option.\n\n726\n00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:44.110\nBut having an archive is your next bet.\n\n727\n00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:46.440\nAnd you shouldn't have\nto go to the archive.\n\n728\n00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.030\nAt times you'd go to the archive.\n\n729\n00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:50.120\nWhat if you accidentally delete a user?\n\n730\n00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:54.600\nIf I accidentally delete a user,\nthat's gonna replicate to the replicas.\n\n731\n00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.150\nSo now it's deleted on the replicas too.\n\n732\n00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:59.280\nSo I promote one of them, it doesn't make\nany difference, right, the user is gone.\n\n733\n00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.310\nI have to go back to an archive for that.\n\n734\n00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:04.060\nBut I have to restore\nthe archive on my primary, and\n\n735\n00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.060\nnow my primary is back in time.\n\n736\n00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.550\nOdds are Kerberos is gonna break, but\nlet's say I do it really fast, right?\n\n737\n00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:14.380\nWell, the replicas are newer and\nthey've got the deletion on them.\n\n738\n00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:17.100\nAnd so that's gonna replicate back\nto that primary and delete it again,\n\n739\n00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.470\nthe user would just disappear again.\n\n740\n00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:20.110\nI didn't achieve my goal.\n\n741\n00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:25.060\nSo if i have to restore from an archive,\nI really need to toast all my replicas,\n\n742\n00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:29.220\nrestore the primary, the master,\nand then recreate all the replicas.\n\n743\n00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.000\nAnd that's gonna disconnect all your work\nstations, you have to rejoin those too.\n\n744\n00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.440\nIt just becomes a giant mess.\n\n745\n00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.640\nSo that's not really the way to go.\n\n746\n00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.240\nSo definitely be aware of that.\n\n747\n00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:43.092\nOpen Directory plus Time Machine equals\novertime, lots of overnight hours.\n\n748\n00:36:43.092 --> 00:36:44.180\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n749\n00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:47.602\nif you're an hourly employee,\nmaybe that's not too bad.\n\n750\n00:36:47.602 --> 00:36:49.720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A lot of individual pieces in\n\n751\n00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.820\nOpen Directory, but it does look like\nwe're running a little short on time.\n\n752\n00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:56.280\nFor this episode, Don,\ngot anything else you'd like to throw in?\n\n753\n00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.320\n>> That's about it for Open Directory,\nit's pretty easy to implement,\n\n754\n00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.470\nit's very reliable.\n\n755\n00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:02.510\nDon't feel like you have to do\na Microsoft Active Directory,\n\n756\n00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:03.680\nApple's Open Directory works great.\n\n757\n00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.530\nYou can definitely implement it.\n\n758\n00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:07.010\nIf you have a Microsoft Active Directory,\nthat works too, though, so\n\n759\n00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:08.730\ndon't feel like you have to\nuse Apple's Open Directory.\n\n760\n00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:10.340\nYou've really got a choice on this one.\n\n761\n00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:13.779\nAll right, well we're gonna go ahead and\nsign out here at ITProTV.\n\n762\n00:37:13.779 --> 00:37:15.375\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n763\n00:37:15.375 --> 00:37:16.129\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n764\n00:37:16.129 --> 00:37:18.402\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n765\n00:37:18.402 --> 00:37:25.830\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.129\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode, we're moving through our OS X\n\n4\n00:00:19.129 --> 00:00:22.691\nserver essentials and we got none\nother than Mr. Don Pezet on hand.\n\n5\n00:00:22.691 --> 00:00:23.800\nDon, how you doing sir?\n\n6\n00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.320\n>> I'm doing great, Wes, ready to dive\nright back into our OS X material.\n\n7\n00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.030\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna\nbe taking a look at user accounts.\n\n8\n00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.830\nAnd I know what you're thinking,\nwait a minute, Don,\n\n9\n00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:40.160\nwe had a whole episode on user accounts\na couple of episodes ago, and yes, we did.\n\n10\n00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.940\nBut, in this episode I want\nto take that same concept and\n\n11\n00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.430\ngo a little more in depth,\n\n12\n00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.140\nand cover some of the behind the scenes\nthings that deal with user accounts.\n\n13\n00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.590\nWhen we tackled it last time, we saw local\naccounts and we saw network accounts and\n\n14\n00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.780\nwe went through the authentication\nprocess, how authentication works.\n\n15\n00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.640\nBut beyond that there's a lot\nmore that's just dealing\n\n16\n00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.780\nwith managing those user accounts.\n\n17\n00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.830\nSo we're gonna tackle that.\n\n18\n00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.940\nWe'll talk a little bit about groups,\ntoo, and troubleshooting,\n\n19\n00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.920\na few other different things that\nwe can kind of mess around with and\n\n20\n00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.240\nfigure out how everything's going.\n\n21\n00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.180\nSo that's what we're gonna be taking\na look at and it should be a good time.\n\n22\n00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.740\n>> Yeah, when it comes down to it\nwe've got a few different types, or\n\n23\n00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.170\na couple different types of accounts, Don.\n\n24\n00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.800\nCan you tells us a little bit about the\ndifferent types that we can expect to see?\n\n25\n00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.350\n>> All right, so the two main types that\nwe need to worry about are the local and\n\n26\n00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.530\nnetwork accounts, right?\n\n27\n00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.510\nAnd the terminology's a little bit weird\nbecause we talk about local accounts,\n\n28\n00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.470\nthose are user accounts that exist\nright on your individual Mac.\n\n29\n00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.390\nThey're managed individually on each\nindependent system, they're not combined.\n\n30\n00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.540\nSo those type of accounts, some people\nrefer to the as work group account, but\n\n31\n00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.740\nthey're really just local to your\nown machine, so local accounts.\n\n32\n00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.620\nWhere it gets tricky\nare the network accounts\n\n33\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.880\nbecause we call them network accounts.\n\n34\n00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.230\nThey're stored on an open\ndirectory somewhere, but\n\n35\n00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.820\nApple calls them local network accounts.\n\n36\n00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.180\nAnd the reason they call them local\nnetwork accounts is because they exist on\n\n37\n00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.570\nan open directory server somewhere and\nso they're local to that server but\n\n38\n00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.330\nthey are available on the network also,\nall right.\n\n39\n00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.420\nNow when you create a user account you\nreally have this limited window of where\n\n40\n00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.500\nyou can set that, during creation, because\nyou can't change it after the fact.\n\n41\n00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.460\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n42\n00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.014\nSo I've got this server here, and this\nserver is an Open Directory server, so\n\n43\n00:02:17.014 --> 00:02:21.637\nit's got Open Directory on it, and that\nmeans I can have both local accounts and\n\n44\n00:02:21.637 --> 00:02:22.826\nnetwork accounts.\n\n45\n00:02:22.826 --> 00:02:27.179\nNow, if I go into my System Preferences,\nand I go into the Users and Groups,\n\n46\n00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:30.180\nI'm only going to see local accounts here,\nright?\n\n47\n00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.560\nI see Don Pezet, I'm an admin and I see\nguest user, which is disabled by default.\n\n48\n00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.590\nThose are local accounts.\n\n49\n00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.210\nIf I were to add a new account, well,\nI can only add local accounts here.\n\n50\n00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.110\nSo, if I go to Add, here it is.\n\n51\n00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.210\nI can create a new account.\n\n52\n00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.820\nAnd you have variations of local accounts,\nright?\n\n53\n00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.570\nAdministrator, they can do\nwhatever they want to the system.\n\n54\n00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.930\nStandard, it's a regular user,\nthey can't install software,\n\n55\n00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.302\nthey're kind of limited\non what they can do.\n\n56\n00:02:55.302 --> 00:02:57.620\nManaged with Parental Controls,\n\n57\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.680\nthis is a standard user that has the\nparental controls options turned on, so\n\n58\n00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.950\nwe can restrict what web pages they\ncan get to and programs they can run.\n\n59\n00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.200\nSharing Only.\n\n60\n00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.810\nSharing Only means they\ncan't log in on this machine\n\n61\n00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.160\nthey can only access it via the network.\n\n62\n00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.230\nNow that starts to sound\nlike Open Directory.\n\n63\n00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.230\nThey can log into this\nmachine from the network.\n\n64\n00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.210\nWhatever machine they're at they still\nhave to have a valid account over there.\n\n65\n00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.660\nThat's the difference with Open Directory,\n\n66\n00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.225\nwith Open Directory you can use\nthe same account everywhere.\n\n67\n00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:26.550\nWith Sharing Only the account only applies\nwhen they're accessing this machine via\n\n68\n00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.060\nthe network.\n\n69\n00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.530\nSo these are the kinda four variations.\n\n70\n00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.690\nWell if I go to my server app instead,\n\n71\n00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.460\nin the server app I can create\nuser accounts too, right.\n\n72\n00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.140\nSo if I go over here under Accounts and\nUsers I'll see my user accounts and\n\n73\n00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.230\nthere's that Don Pezet account, and you'll\nsee over here it's in the Local Directory,\n\n74\n00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.170\nit's a local account.\n\n75\n00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.670\nBut, I can add more users and\nI can add those network account right.\n\n76\n00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.108\nSo, when I go to Add,\nI have to choose that right here,\n\n77\n00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:55.300\nI wanna make it a local network account.\n\n78\n00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.680\nYou cannot change this after the fact.\n\n79\n00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.540\nSo, for example my account, when I look at\nmy account here's that Don Pezet account,\n\n80\n00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.960\nit's a local directory account.\n\n81\n00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.310\nMaybe I wanna convert that to\nan Open Directory account, I can't.\n\n82\n00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.050\nIf I edit that, so\nif I just pull up that user,\n\n83\n00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.650\nthere's no option in here that change\nit to make it a network account.\n\n84\n00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.680\nIt's just, it's stuck,\nit's local only, that's it.\n\n85\n00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.080\nWell, you got the Home Folder option but\n\n86\n00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.620\nthat doesn't actually apply\nto where the account resides.\n\n87\n00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.340\nIt just whether or\nnot it has a home directory, right?\n\n88\n00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.110\nSo there's no way to\nchange it after the fact.\n\n89\n00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.190\nSo you got to get it\nright the first time and\n\n90\n00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.040\nthe place I find people make most\nmistakes are when it comes to groups.\n\n91\n00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.550\nWhen you go and create a group\nbecause you can mess it up there and\n\n92\n00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.510\nyou don't even notice right away, but\n\n93\n00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.300\nfor a user account if I wanna\ncreate an account for Wes, right?\n\n94\n00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.050\nI can come in here and\ncreate an account for Wes Bryan, and\n\n95\n00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.040\nI can give him account name, and\nemail address, password, all the other\n\n96\n00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.330\nvarious things I think he needs to have\nfor his account, and then I can create it.\n\n97\n00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.960\nWell let's talk about all\nthese various things.\n\n98\n00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.330\nI've been talking about this first\noption here, the directory, right?\n\n99\n00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.260\nLocal, or local network, right?\n\n100\n00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.090\nSo that's choosing where it gets stored.\n\n101\n00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.740\nDoes it get stored on the local machine or\nin the Open Directory?\n\n102\n00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.410\nThen the Full Name,\nthe Full Name is what Mac OS uses.\n\n103\n00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.220\nWe see this on the login screens.\n\n104\n00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.460\nYou can log in with it,\nit's what we normally see, ourselves.\n\n105\n00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.930\nThe Account Name, that's for\nthe BSD Unix subsystem, right?\n\n106\n00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.200\nThat's the name behind the scenes.\n\n107\n00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.140\nNow it's funny because I\nsay it's behind the scenes.\n\n108\n00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.120\nIt's actually not even\nwhat the system uses.\n\n109\n00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.490\nBecause attached to this user is a UID,\na user ID.\n\n110\n00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.230\nAnd it's a number, it's usually three\ndigits, they typically start at 500 so\n\n111\n00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.270\nif Wes is the second account I've created,\nhe's probably 502.\n\n112\n00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.860\nThen that number is what the system\nactually pays attention to.\n\n113\n00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.560\nThe system doesn't care what his full\nname is or what his account name is, but\n\n114\n00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.360\nthat is for us to be human readable.\n\n115\n00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.130\nAnd in the UNIX world,\nyou can't have spaces, and so\n\n116\n00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.980\nthat's why we have two different names.\n\n117\n00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.090\nThe full name, they can be all pretty,\nwe can make it whatever we want.\n\n118\n00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.180\nWell, I guess we have limits there, right?\n\n119\n00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.620\nOn the exam this might come up.\n\n120\n00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:05.460\nIt's really letters, numbers, and spaces,\nand so I can do capital and lower case.\n\n121\n00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.800\nIt will let you do I think it's underscore\nand period I think is the limit.\n\n122\n00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.550\nIt's easy to find out if you\ntype an unsupported character.\n\n123\n00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:19.263\nSo if you look here, I've got Wes Bryan,\nI've got a capital W and a lower case e.\n\n124\n00:06:19.263 --> 00:06:24.127\nI've got a space between Wes and Bryan,\nI did an underscore and a period after it,\n\n125\n00:06:24.127 --> 00:06:27.370\nbut if I start doing things\nlike exclamation points and\n\n126\n00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.776\n@s and symbols like that,\nit starts to get angry at you.\n\n127\n00:06:30.776 --> 00:06:33.530\nIt doesn't want you doing\nthose other characters, okay.\n\n128\n00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.040\nSo there are limitations to\nwhat we can jam in there,\n\n129\n00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.940\nso you really need to try and\nhold it to letters, numbers, and\n\n130\n00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.096\nspaces underscores if you need them and\nhyphens and periods.\n\n131\n00:06:45.096 --> 00:06:48.770\nThe account name is a lot more strict,\nbecause it needs to be letters or\n\n132\n00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.480\nnumbers and underscored or\nhyphens and that's about it.\n\n133\n00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.000\nYou're kind of limited on what you\nwant to do there cuz it's what\n\n134\n00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.780\nfalls into that BSD\nsubsystem under the hood.\n\n135\n00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.260\nSo this one gets really picky.\n\n136\n00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.170\nIf I try and type exclamation points\nit's not even letting me type them.\n\n137\n00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.699\nI can't type an @ symbol or whatever.\n\n138\n00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:08.630\nI can type numbers.\n\n139\n00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.110\nI can't do spaces.\n\n140\n00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.970\nI'm hitting the space bar and\nnothing's happening.\n\n141\n00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.100\nI can do underscores and\n\n142\n00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.000\nhyphens, periods, right, but\nnone of the other special characters.\n\n143\n00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.533\nSo it's much more limited\nin what you can do.\n\n144\n00:07:22.533 --> 00:07:25.050\nAfter that we've got our email address.\n\n145\n00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.090\nThis is just, an email,\nthis really in use for\n\n146\n00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.980\nthe contact system in OS X,\nit has no true bearing.\n\n147\n00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.873\nThe system doesn't even verify\nthat email address even exists,\n\n148\n00:07:32.873 --> 00:07:34.195\ndoesn't necessarily know.\n\n149\n00:07:34.195 --> 00:07:36.916\nBut if I wanna put in an email address for\nWes, so\n\n150\n00:07:36.916 --> 00:07:39.512\nI might say that he is wes@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n151\n00:07:39.512 --> 00:07:42.042\nI can punch that in, shoot, I hit Enter.\n\n152\n00:07:42.042 --> 00:07:43.599\nWell, it's gonna create his account.\n\n153\n00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:47.149\nI can punch that in, and\nit's gonna make it and now,\n\n154\n00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:50.230\nit just has that email address on file.\n\n155\n00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.354\nSo if I go into my contacts,\nI can see that email address, and\n\n156\n00:07:53.354 --> 00:07:55.883\nif I've got mail set up,\nI can try and email him.\n\n157\n00:07:55.883 --> 00:07:57.137\nLet me add another user.\n\n158\n00:07:57.137 --> 00:08:01.672\nLet's see, let's create an account for\ngood old Dave Mustaine, right.\n\n159\n00:08:01.672 --> 00:08:06.145\nSo we're gonna give Dave Mustaine\nan account, we'll make him dmustaine.\n\n160\n00:08:06.145 --> 00:08:08.392\nAnd the format you use for\nthe Account Name,\n\n161\n00:08:08.392 --> 00:08:12.100\nI'm kinda in the habit of using\nfirst initial, last name.\n\n162\n00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.804\nYou can use whatever you want,\nyou can use full names written out.\n\n163\n00:08:15.804 --> 00:08:20.520\nI could say davemustaine,\nI could say davem, or whatever.\n\n164\n00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.140\nIt's whatever works for you.\n\n165\n00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.890\nJust know that in your organization\nyou might have duplicates.\n\n166\n00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:30.170\nI might have two John Smiths, or I might\nhave a John Smith and a James Smith.\n\n167\n00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.730\nWell, if I am doing\nfirst initial last name,\n\n168\n00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.350\nthose two are gonna have\nthe same account name,\n\n169\n00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.070\nso I've gotta have some system in\nplace for dealing with duplicates.\n\n170\n00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.650\nThat's the only thing\nI have to worry about.\n\n171\n00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.720\nYou don't wanna have two\naccounts with the same name.\n\n172\n00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.300\nAll right,\nafter that we've got the password.\n\n173\n00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.500\nOn the password, ideally you should use\na strong password but I've actually been\n\n174\n00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.530\nusing the word password, all lowercase,\nwhich is about as weak as you can get.\n\n175\n00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.510\nI might as well be leaving the password\nfields blank at this point, right, but\n\n176\n00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:59.200\nyou can use the password assistant right\nhere to come up with a secure password.\n\n177\n00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.050\nIf you click on that little key,\nyou'll get a pop up that will appear,\n\n178\n00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.809\napparently way over here on the other\nside of my screen, there we go.\n\n179\n00:09:05.809 --> 00:09:08.720\nAnd it'll help you generate\nan automatic password and\n\n180\n00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.600\nit's got a few different ways\nthat it can do it, right?\n\n181\n00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.810\nMemorable passwords, letters and numbers,\n\n182\n00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.530\nnumbers only, FIPS-181 compliant or\ntruly random.\n\n183\n00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:20.870\nSo you can pick it like this and\nit'll gauge how strong that password is.\n\n184\n00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.850\nAnd you'll see if I come in here and tell\nit that I'm gonna do a manual entry and\n\n185\n00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.450\nI'm doing password all lower case.\n\n186\n00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.320\nI didn't get a very good rating, right?\n\n187\n00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.906\nSo maybe if I add 123.\n\n188\n00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:33.510\nThere we go, now we're safe, right?\n\n189\n00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.600\nIt's still a terrible password.\n\n190\n00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.760\nSo the little meter there is only so good.\n\n191\n00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.140\nYou need to find a good\ncombination of things and\n\n192\n00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.830\nusually you wanna mix capital and\nlowercase, and things like that.\n\n193\n00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:50.300\nAnd then the longer the password gets,\nthe more secure it gets, right?\n\n194\n00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.550\nEven though I just entered 1 through 0,\nthat wasn't terribly secure.\n\n195\n00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.740\nIt's just trying to help you,\ngive you some basic coaching advice.\n\n196\n00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.635\nNot the greatest thing.\n\n197\n00:09:58.635 --> 00:10:01.176\nAll right, it is warning me,\nthis is too repetitive.\n\n198\n00:10:01.176 --> 00:10:02.620\nIn other words, it picked up that pattern.\n\n199\n00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.930\nSo it gave me a good quality but it still\nwarned me about that little problem.\n\n200\n00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.130\nI didn't have that warning before, right?\n\n201\n00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:13.551\nSo if I start doing repeating patterns or\nwhatever, it will pick up on that and\n\n202\n00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:14.579\nwarn me about it.\n\n203\n00:10:14.579 --> 00:10:17.760\nAll right, so that's kind of the password\nfield, not too terribly exciting.\n\n204\n00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.499\nThen as you keep scrolling down here,\n\n205\n00:10:20.499 --> 00:10:23.300\nyou'll see allow user to\nadminister this server.\n\n206\n00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:23.810\nWhat does that mean?\n\n207\n00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.320\nAre they allowed to run the server app and\nconnect to the system and\n\n208\n00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.420\nstart to manage it?\n\n209\n00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.290\nAre regular users not allowed to do that?\n\n210\n00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.900\nSo am I gonna let them be an administrator\non the system, can they use the server\n\n211\n00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.990\napp, can they go into system preferences,\ncan they be an admin on the server?\n\n212\n00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.290\nWell, maybe I want them to be,\nmaybe I don't.\n\n213\n00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:42.950\nThis is one we can change after the fact.\n\n214\n00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.460\nYou can make somebody an administrator or\ntake it away.\n\n215\n00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.030\nIt's actually manged by a group and\nso you can kinda move people in and\n\n216\n00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.950\nout of the group if you need to.\n\n217\n00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.240\nBut just checking this little\nbox here takes care of that and\n\n218\n00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.350\nnow this user will be an administrator.\n\n219\n00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:59.860\nThe home folder I talked about before,\non every Mac there's a /users folder,\n\n220\n00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.520\nand when you create a user account,\nwell, they get a folder there.\n\n221\n00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.934\nBut if you're an open directory server,\nyou could have 50,000 users,\n\n222\n00:11:07.934 --> 00:11:09.010\nright, in your open directory.\n\n223\n00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:13.360\nDo they all need home folders\non your open directory server?\n\n224\n00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.470\nNo, they're probably never gonna\nlog in on the server itself.\n\n225\n00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.250\nThey're gonna log in on\ntheir own work stations.\n\n226\n00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.530\nSo yeah, you want them to have a home\nfolder on their own work station but\n\n227\n00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.490\nnot necessarily here.\n\n228\n00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.800\nSo you might choose not to\ncreate a home folder and\n\n229\n00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.730\ninstead set it to services only.\n\n230\n00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.110\nOkay, what does Services Only mean?\n\n231\n00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:32.210\nWell, Services Only means they cannot\nsit down and log in on this machine, but\n\n232\n00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.000\nthey can access all\nthe services via the networks.\n\n233\n00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.810\nSo they can access DNS, they can\naccess file sharing, they can access\n\n234\n00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:41.940\nOpen Directory, all the services\nthe server provides via the network.\n\n235\n00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.170\nThey gotta go to their own machine.\n\n236\n00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.065\nThey can't do it from here.\n\n237\n00:11:44.065 --> 00:11:46.500\nOftentimes that's what we want.\n\n238\n00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.070\nYou don't want Bob from\nthe mailroom to come and\n\n239\n00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.280\nsit down on your Open Directory server and\nstart messing around.\n\n240\n00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.130\nThat would not be good, right.\n\n241\n00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.070\nWell, I made this user an administrator so\n\n242\n00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:59.630\nit kinda makes sense to let them log in on\nthis machine and have their own folder.\n\n243\n00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:03.410\nSo I'll go ahead and set that, but for\na regular user you might not want that.\n\n244\n00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.360\nIf you do give them a home folder,\nby default they can put as\n\n245\n00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.750\nmuch stuff in there as they want, but\nyou can actually set a quota right here.\n\n246\n00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.700\nYou can limit their disk usage,\nthen you can specify a size.\n\n247\n00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.444\nSo I can set up a quota and\n\n248\n00:12:15.444 --> 00:12:20.078\nsay I don't want this person to\nhave more than two gigs of data.\n\n249\n00:12:20.078 --> 00:12:23.962\nI was about to write up 2048 megabytes,\nbut I can just change this to gigs, and\n\n250\n00:12:23.962 --> 00:12:25.610\nnow it's two gigabytes, right?\n\n251\n00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.030\nSo now that person's home\nfolder will be limited.\n\n252\n00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.980\nThat stops one person from potentially\nfilling up the whole hard drive.\n\n253\n00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.870\nYou can set these limits.\n\n254\n00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:37.650\n>> Don, if you do give somebody\nthe local only home folder there,\n\n255\n00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:41.810\nhow does that interact with,\nlet's say, them logging in and\n\n256\n00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.620\nauthenticating against\nOpen Directory on another machine?\n\n257\n00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.440\nWhat would they see?\n\n258\n00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.950\nWhat would their experience be?\n\n259\n00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.450\n>> So they wouldn't.\n\n260\n00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.000\nIts kind of interesting, cuz you see,\nit's they have a home folder.\n\n261\n00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.510\nSo no matter which computer I go to,\nI am gonna have that home folder, right.\n\n262\n00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.468\nWrong, on every computer you have your own\nhome folder and they don't synchronize.\n\n263\n00:12:58.468 --> 00:13:01.989\nSo if I am logged into one computer and\nI put a document on my desktop and\n\n264\n00:13:01.989 --> 00:13:04.720\nI get up and walk over to\nanother computer and I log in,\n\n265\n00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.570\nthat document is not on\nmy desktop over there.\n\n266\n00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.530\nAll right,\nif I want that kind of synchronization,\n\n267\n00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:14.210\nI need to tell my users to use a network\nshared location instead, right.\n\n268\n00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.670\nMount a network drive and\nput your stuff there, and\n\n269\n00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.850\nthat way it'll be available on\nevery computer, or use iCloud.\n\n270\n00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.890\niCloud will synchronize your documents and\n\n271\n00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.510\nit will synchronize your favorites and\nso on.\n\n272\n00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.560\nSo if you log in with\nan iCloud identity or\n\n273\n00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.920\nan Apple ID that'll take care of that,\nright.\n\n274\n00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.010\nAnd even schools now are starting to issue\nout Apple IDs just for their students so\n\n275\n00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.660\nthey can all have that synchronization,\nall happens through Apple's system.\n\n276\n00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.060\nBut by default it doesn't happen.\n\n277\n00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.410\nThese home folders are local\nto particular machines,\n\n278\n00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.250\ndoesn't matter if you're using\na network account or not.\n\n279\n00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.870\nSo they're kind of\nlimited in functionality.\n\n280\n00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.210\nAll right, the next block is keywords.\n\n281\n00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:52.090\nNow I left this empty in the other show,\nand I was about to leave it empty here.\n\n282\n00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.030\nBut let me explain what the keyword's for.\n\n283\n00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.700\nIf you have a small environment,\nyou really don't care about this field.\n\n284\n00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:57.690\nYou'll never use it.\n\n285\n00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:02.100\nBut if you have 50,000 users, there\nwill be occasions where you wanna filter\n\n286\n00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.020\nthe user list to see users\nof a particular type.\n\n287\n00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.170\nAnd so you can put keywords in here\nto make it where you can search and\n\n288\n00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:09.480\nfind these people.\n\n289\n00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.910\nSo for example,\nI might say accounting employee.\n\n290\n00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:18.880\nAnd, I don't know,\n\n291\n00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:25.800\nalertteam or instant response team or\nsomething like that, right?\n\n292\n00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.700\nAnd so now if I ever wanna pull up\na list of all the employees that are in\n\n293\n00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.370\naccounting, I can do a filter for\nthe keyword accounting, and\n\n294\n00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.120\nit'll just show those employees.\n\n295\n00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.340\nIt's not a group.\n\n296\n00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.610\nI can't assign permissions to it.\n\n297\n00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.600\nBut I can find them based on this.\n\n298\n00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.520\nThere's times where we wanna\nfilter user accounts, but\n\n299\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.710\nwe don't necessarily want\na corresponding group to it.\n\n300\n00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.460\nAnd so we can create keywords like\nthis to make it easy to search and\n\n301\n00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.750\nfind these users.\n\n302\n00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.330\nNow to be honest with you,\nI typically still use groups,\n\n303\n00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.680\nbut you can use keywords.\n\n304\n00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.150\nThe thing I don't like about the keywords,\nit's too easy to make a typo.\n\n305\n00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:59.470\nAnd so I might accidentally leave a C off,\nand then when I search for\n\n306\n00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:02.870\nacounting, that's different\nthan accounting with two C's.\n\n307\n00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.130\nSee how it converted\nthat all into one tag?\n\n308\n00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:08.120\nI should have separated those out,\nand I didn't.\n\n309\n00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.960\nBut so\nthere's account versus accounting, and\n\n310\n00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.670\nthen you can start punching\nin each different one.\n\n311\n00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.100\nThey're all now keywords we can\nsearch to find these users.\n\n312\n00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.080\nAnd then Notes, this is notes for you.\n\n313\n00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.450\nYou can type notes about that user,\nthings you need to remember,\n\n314\n00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:25.190\nother information about them, contact\ninfo, whatever it is that you wanna\n\n315\n00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.179\nput in there, and you can store\nthat information on that user.\n\n316\n00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.810\nAll right, so apparently we are hiring\nDave Mustaine as our accountant.\n\n317\n00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:37.834\nSo I'll go ahead and\ncreate that account, and once it's done.\n\n318\n00:15:37.834 --> 00:15:41.443\nI guess I will have to type\nthe password correctly.\n\n319\n00:15:41.443 --> 00:15:43.134\nMake a little bit of a difference.\n\n320\n00:15:43.134 --> 00:15:46.553\nSo I'll go ahead and\ncreate that account and once its in place,\n\n321\n00:15:46.553 --> 00:15:51.300\nnow I've got that user account and it's\nright there and it's good to go, right?\n\n322\n00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.276\nNot too crazy exciting.\n\n323\n00:15:53.276 --> 00:15:57.162\nIf I go down here and hit the little gear,\nyou'll see where I can edit the user.\n\n324\n00:15:57.162 --> 00:15:59.321\nI can edit the mail options of that user.\n\n325\n00:15:59.321 --> 00:16:00.839\nI can change their passwords.\n\n326\n00:16:00.839 --> 00:16:02.264\nWe've got few different options here.\n\n327\n00:16:02.264 --> 00:16:05.747\nWe can also edit their access to services.\n\n328\n00:16:05.747 --> 00:16:08.441\nAnd that's something\nthat's kind of important,\n\n329\n00:16:08.441 --> 00:16:12.590\nbecause we might not want them to be\nable to access every single service.\n\n330\n00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:18.020\nWe can start to filter that functionality,\nso if I do edit Access to Services.\n\n331\n00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:23.710\nI had chosen Dave Musaine and now I can\npick and choose what he has access to.\n\n332\n00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:30.520\nSo, I might want him to be able to\naccess the file sharing functionality.\n\n333\n00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.400\nBut I don't want him to be able to SSHN or\ndo screen sharing.\n\n334\n00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.610\nI don't want them to mess with VPN.\n\n335\n00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:41.010\nAnd so, I can start controlling what\nhe has access to on a per user basis.\n\n336\n00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:45.790\nAnd that's really nice, because this\napplies no matter what computer he's on.\n\n337\n00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:49.580\nNo matter what IP address he has, I don't\nhave to worry about all that stuff.\n\n338\n00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.020\nIf somebody is trying to\nlogin as Dave Musain and\n\n339\n00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.845\nSSH in, it's not going to let him do it.\n\n340\n00:16:53.845 --> 00:16:55.285\nWven though he's an administrator,\n\n341\n00:16:55.285 --> 00:16:59.060\nbecause I just removed that\nfunction from his user account.\n\n342\n00:16:59.060 --> 00:16:59.980\nSo, you can pick and\n\n343\n00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.389\nchoose and tweak that beyond what you\nnormally have with a user account.\n\n344\n00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.785\n>> Now Don, you know one thing I would\nsay, let's say, that we go to Old Dave.\n\n345\n00:17:07.785 --> 00:17:11.320\nAnd we realize that he hasn't really\ndone a good job with our accounting.\n\n346\n00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.535\nHe's done a great job on guitar,\nbut not so much on accounting.\n\n347\n00:17:14.535 --> 00:17:18.210\n>> [Laugh]\n>> And it's time to maybe part ways or\n\n348\n00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.050\nhave him part ways and hand him his hat.\n\n349\n00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.025\nAre there some options?\n\n350\n00:17:21.025 --> 00:17:24.550\nBecause I'm sure we're not going to want\nhis account just floating out there in\n\n351\n00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:25.260\nelectrical limbo.\n\n352\n00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.420\nDo we have options with that?\n\n353\n00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.140\n>> All right, so\n\n354\n00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.810\nthere's a couple things you could do when\nit's time to terminate an employee, right.\n\n355\n00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:30.910\nWe want to get rid of him.\n\n356\n00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:34.380\nThe temptation is just go delete the user\naccount and that certainly works.\n\n357\n00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.780\nYou can just go and delete the user\naccount, but here's the thing.\n\n358\n00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:43.890\nThere might be something somewhere on a\nwork station somewhere that he encrypted.\n\n359\n00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.170\nAnd you need his user\naccount to decrypt it.\n\n360\n00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.860\nOr you just for whatever reason, you need\nhis account to be able to do something.\n\n361\n00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.960\nAnd if you delete his account,\nyou've just lost that ability.\n\n362\n00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.080\nAnd we don't have a great way to\nrestore a deleted user account.\n\n363\n00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.200\nSo instead,\nwe probably want to keep it around.\n\n364\n00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.420\nBut if you keep it around,\nhe could still log in, couldn't he?\n\n365\n00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.160\nBut we could reset the password,\nso you reset the password.\n\n366\n00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.290\nResetting the password is easy, right?\n\n367\n00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:07.490\nYou can just take a user and\nif you control click on them, right.\n\n368\n00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.250\nso I'll take Dave Mustaine here and\n\n369\n00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:12.360\nI will control click or I guess I could\nhave used the gear down at the bottom.\n\n370\n00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.186\nAnd when you control click,\nyou've got Change Password.\n\n371\n00:18:15.186 --> 00:18:18.950\nSo, we can just go and change the password\non the account and there you go.\n\n372\n00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:23.830\nBut now, it's still an active account and\nso, somebody could guess that password and\n\n373\n00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:24.395\nlog in as him.\n\n374\n00:18:24.395 --> 00:18:27.510\nI'm leaving myself a little\nbit exposed there, right.\n\n375\n00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.930\nWe could also edit the user and\nif you edit the user,\n\n376\n00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.420\nyou'll see allow user to log in.\n\n377\n00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.860\nAnd if you remove that option,\nthe user account is still active, but\n\n378\n00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.460\nit can no longer log in.\n\n379\n00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.110\nIt's called a disabled account.\n\n380\n00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.640\nWe've disabled Dave.\n\n381\n00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:49.200\nSo if he tries to log in or anybody else\ntries to log in as him, it will fail.\n\n382\n00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.830\nAnd if I ever need his account for\n\n383\n00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:53.820\nsomething, I can come and\nre-enable that option.\n\n384\n00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.220\nAnd now, I can log in and\ndo whatever as I need and\n\n385\n00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.660\nthen when I'm done,\nI can remove that option again.\n\n386\n00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.350\nAnd now, he still has an account,\nbut it's disabled and\n\n387\n00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.750\nby doing that,\nsee how it shows right there.\n\n388\n00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:10.180\nDave Mustaine, disabled so he's locked out\nand I don't have to worry about it, right.\n\n389\n00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.980\nYeah, yeah, yeah/ I'm safe there.\n\n390\n00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.720\nNobody can brute force and get in\nthe same, because the account is disabled.\n\n391\n00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.131\nI can turn it on when I need it.\n\n392\n00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:20.156\nAnd so,\nit's kind of a neat feature to have and\n\n393\n00:19:20.156 --> 00:19:24.020\nyou can even, if you come up here and\ndo a search for disabled users.\n\n394\n00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:29.130\nSee how when I type disabled, it's got,\n\"key word contains disabled,\" \"name begins\n\n395\n00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.980\nor ends,\" this is where we\ncan apply filters like that.\n\n396\n00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.700\nAnd when we apply that filter, shoot,\n\n397\n00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.370\nactually it doesn't count as\npart of the name, does it?\n\n398\n00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.020\nYeah, we would just have to\npay attention right there.\n\n399\n00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.300\nSorry, I thought we could\nfilter based on disabled.\n\n400\n00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.500\nWe could filter based on accounting,\nright?\n\n401\n00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.180\nSo, if I do keyword contains accounting,\nthere he is and\n\n402\n00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.840\nwe could just do a keyword for disabled.\n\n403\n00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.950\nThat would solve it too and\nthen, we'd be able to search and\n\n404\n00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:51.480\nfind out or put it in his notes.\n\n405\n00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.690\nSorry guys, I could have swore you could\nfilter by disabled, though I guess not.\n\n406\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.260\nSo anyhow, there's an example of how\nwe can disable that account and now,\n\n407\n00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:58.850\nit's safe.\n\n408\n00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:00.410\nAnd that was just a regular option.\n\n409\n00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:01.350\nYou might have noticed,\n\n410\n00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:05.030\nwhen I control clicked that\nthere's advanced options, too.\n\n411\n00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:08.750\nAnd when you go into advanced options,\nthis is where we can go in and\n\n412\n00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.260\nmodify that account name if we need to.\n\n413\n00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.740\nWe can see what group they're a part of,\nand you don't want to mess with the group.\n\n414\n00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.020\nAnd there's that user\nid I was talking about.\n\n415\n00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.760\nI mentioned that Wess\nwould probably be 502,\n\n416\n00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.670\nlooks like I was off a little bit\nbecause Dave Mustaine is 1026.\n\n417\n00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.870\nThis is the number the system\nactually cares about.\n\n418\n00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:27.700\nDoesn't care so much about the names.\n\n419\n00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.280\nIt's that main one that really matters.\n\n420\n00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.560\nAnd you can see things\nlike the login shell and\n\n421\n00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.040\nwhere that home directory is stored.\n\n422\n00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.610\nThose are all things that we can\nspecify and have tied to the user.\n\n423\n00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:44.610\nAll right, you know while I was in there,\nI doubt it'll show up on the exam.\n\n424\n00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:45.580\nBut let me just point this out,\n\n425\n00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:51.700\nI mentioned how the users home directory\nis not synchronized by default.\n\n426\n00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.870\nSee how you've got this share\npoint URL here and in the example,\n\n427\n00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.420\nit's pointing to an Apple\nfile protocol location.\n\n428\n00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.520\nThis is where you can set\na default share location for them.\n\n429\n00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.310\nSo that when they login,\nthey'll see the shared folder and\n\n430\n00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.460\nif they put their data there.\n\n431\n00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.570\nThen it'll always be present\nwhen they go to other machines.\n\n432\n00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.080\nYou can set that up.\n\n433\n00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:14.460\nIt's the equivalent of a roaming\nprofile from the Microsoft world,\n\n434\n00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.020\nbut in the Apple world, it's really\njust a folder that's available.\n\n435\n00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.230\nAnd you can achieve the same thing\njust by sharing a folder and\n\n436\n00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:21.230\nhaving the user browse to it themselves,\nright.\n\n437\n00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:25.160\nSo, there's a few different options\non how to do that, all right.\n\n438\n00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.570\nAnother thing I want to point out is,\n\n439\n00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:30.140\nin a small environment, creating user\naccounts is not a big deal, right.\n\n440\n00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.910\nYou just create them and that's it, but if\nyou've got tens of thousands of users and\n\n441\n00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:35.810\nyou're adding 50 at a time.\n\n442\n00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:40.060\nYou don't want it to go through and\ncreate each one by hand, right.\n\n443\n00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.160\nSo, some of you might\nrecognize David Mastaine.\n\n444\n00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.320\nHe's a gentleman in a band and\nthe band has a couple of other members.\n\n445\n00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.140\nSo, I probably want to create\nuser accounts for them, too.\n\n446\n00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:53.070\nWell, I could come in and\ndo it manually, but in OS 10,\n\n447\n00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.250\nthey actually have the ability for\nyou to import users.\n\n448\n00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:58.160\nNow, it's not a very well-documented\nprocedure on the exam,\n\n449\n00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.770\nthey just want you to be\naware that you can import it.\n\n450\n00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.700\nBut in the show notes, I'll actually\nput a link to one of their stashed\n\n451\n00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.150\naway articles that they don't update.\n\n452\n00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:07.180\nWhere it explains how to\nbuild the import file.\n\n453\n00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.740\nBut let me just show you a quick example\nhere So, I've got good old Dave Mustaine.\n\n454\n00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.400\nI want to add the other band members and\nso, down here, I can hit the gear,\n\n455\n00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.330\nand you'll see where\nI've got import users.\n\n456\n00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:19.740\nWe can import users into\nthe open directory.\n\n457\n00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:24.000\nAnd when you do that, you have to build\na file that's formatted a very particular\n\n458\n00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.560\nway and I happen to have a file.\n\n459\n00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.160\nWhoops!\n\n460\n00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.230\nThat is formatted that\nvery particular way,\n\n461\n00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:35.130\nso let me just show you guys\nthe way the file has to be built.\n\n462\n00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:39.100\nIs it needs a header that identifies\nthe type of records that you're storing.\n\n463\n00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.350\nAnd I don't have these memorized,\nI'm not going to pretend that I do.\n\n464\n00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:45.060\nI got these right out of\nApple's documentation that\n\n465\n00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.990\nI had to dig pretty hard to find.\n\n466\n00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.810\nBut what you're doing is, you're basically\nsaying i'm going to create standard users.\n\n467\n00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:57.050\nIn my scenario, I'm going to have a record\nname, a password, and a real name.\n\n468\n00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.930\nThose are the three values\nthat i'm providing.\n\n469\n00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.710\nSo I'm telling it, i'm providing\nthree values and then, after that,\n\n470\n00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:02.970\nI give those things.\n\n471\n00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.750\nHere's the account name followed by\nthe password followed by the full name.\n\n472\n00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.730\nThat's the bare minimum\nto create an account.\n\n473\n00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.380\nYou can specify other things too,\nbut these are the bare minimums.\n\n474\n00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:16.110\nAnd I can take a file that's structured\nlike this and input the users all at once.\n\n475\n00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:20.020\nBring them in and get them created, so\nif I go back here to my user list and\n\n476\n00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.210\nI hit that gear and\nI chose to import users.\n\n477\n00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:28.080\nI can browse and pick that file right\noff of my desktop and import them in.\n\n478\n00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.130\nI forgot something,\nit needs an admin password, so\n\n479\n00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.270\nI'm going to punch in an admin password.\n\n480\n00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:37.980\nWe've got that diradmin account that we\ncreated when open directory was installed,\n\n481\n00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.670\nso I'll just punch that in.\n\n482\n00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:43.530\nAnd for the directory,\nsee how it's showing that Local Directory?\n\n483\n00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.190\nWe're Local Network Directory.\n\n484\n00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.380\nI could have made a bad mistake there.\n\n485\n00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.190\nIf I left it at Local Directory it's\ngoing to create local accounts.\n\n486\n00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:54.320\nI want to create network accounts and\nso, I'll specify that.\n\n487\n00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.930\nThen we'll go and import those users in.\n\n488\n00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:58.996\nIt's going to import, there it goes.\n\n489\n00:23:58.996 --> 00:24:02.442\nNow I magically have Marty Friedman,\nNick Menza.\n\n490\n00:24:02.442 --> 00:24:04.889\nI've got Dave Ellefson,\nso all of them pop up.\n\n491\n00:24:04.889 --> 00:24:07.164\nAnd we created those accounts all at once.\n\n492\n00:24:07.164 --> 00:24:08.659\nSo kinda nice to be able to do that.\n\n493\n00:24:08.659 --> 00:24:10.810\nThe file format is really particular.\n\n494\n00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:13.900\nSo in the show notes for this episode,\nI'll give you guys that exact file that I\n\n495\n00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.860\nused, and I'll give you one for groups\nalso because you can do the same thing.\n\n496\n00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.046\nYou can bulk import groups and\n\n497\n00:24:18.046 --> 00:24:21.035\nit's a lot faster than running through\nthat little wizard over and over and\n\n498\n00:24:21.035 --> 00:24:23.895\nover again if you've got hundreds\nof thousands of accounts to create.\n\n499\n00:24:23.895 --> 00:24:27.783\n>> And it's interesting based on\nyour file we can see which era\n\n500\n00:24:27.783 --> 00:24:30.290\nof Megadeath you actually listen to.\n\n501\n00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:31.050\nThat's great.\n\n502\n00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:33.960\n[LAUGH] Now, when it comes to\nprotecting the account, the first and\n\n503\n00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.012\nforemost major protection we\nhave is obviously our password.\n\n504\n00:24:37.012 --> 00:24:39.960\nAnd you've probably seen in some of\nthe other episodes that we have that we do\n\n505\n00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:45.610\nhave ways to basically control\nhow users implement passwords.\n\n506\n00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.370\nDon, do we have something like that here?\n\n507\n00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:51.370\n>> Yeah, you've probably seen this\npattern where I keep using password and\n\n508\n00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:53.900\npassword123 and\nthey're terrible passwords.\n\n509\n00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.170\nAnd if you leave it up to your end users,\n\n510\n00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:58.540\nhalf your end users will pick\na blank password if they can.\n\n511\n00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.930\nIf they got that option they're like,\n\n512\n00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:02.600\nwe'll just disable that,\ncuz users hate passwords.\n\n513\n00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.140\nBut they're kind of a necessary evil.\n\n514\n00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.220\nWe've got to have them and you want\nyour users to use strong passwords.\n\n515\n00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.360\nSo in OS 10 in the server app, we can\nset what's called a password policy.\n\n516\n00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.400\nYou can just set the requirements for\nhow that password is gonna be structured.\n\n517\n00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.410\nLet me show you where that is.\n\n518\n00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:17.610\nSo I'm in my server app.\n\n519\n00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:22.110\nI'm under users, right, and\nright now I'm looking at all users and\n\n520\n00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:25.970\nwhen you look at all users,\nif you go down here to your gear,\n\n521\n00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:29.540\nyou'll see where there's this edit\npassword policy, but it's grayed out.\n\n522\n00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.240\nI can't choose it.\n\n523\n00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:35.780\nAnd the reason is, passwords are managed\ndifferently for open directory than for\n\n524\n00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.480\nyour local accounts.\n\n525\n00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.383\nAnd when you're looking at all users,\nyou see both, and so\n\n526\n00:25:39.383 --> 00:25:41.100\nyou can't manage a password policy, right?\n\n527\n00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:46.650\nBut if I go up here and I change that,\nto say local network users, now I'm\n\n528\n00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:51.560\njust looking at my open directory accounts\nand they have a common password policy.\n\n529\n00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.200\nAnd so when I go down here and\nclick my gear, now it lights up.\n\n530\n00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.120\nAnd I can choose Edit Password Policy.\n\n531\n00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.620\nI've also got Edit Templates.\n\n532\n00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.870\nA template is whenever\nyou create a new user,\n\n533\n00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:03.220\nthese are the default settings that\nwill be populated for that user.\n\n534\n00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.660\nSo you can create templates for\nanybody in accounting or marketing so\n\n535\n00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.870\nthe users are all created\nin a similar manner.\n\n536\n00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.080\nBut the password policy\nis the one I care about.\n\n537\n00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.280\nAnd when you edit that password policy,\n\n538\n00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.100\nyou'll see where you can\nmake them much stronger and\n\n539\n00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:20.540\nmake it where the passwords that I've been\nentering all episode won't work anymore.\n\n540\n00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:24.410\nRight, so we can say, for example,\nhow long do passwords last for?\n\n541\n00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:25.230\nRight, for the user account.\n\n542\n00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.400\nWhen do I disable a user's log in?\n\n543\n00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.670\nSo I could say that users are only gonna\nbe valid, or passwords are gonna be valid\n\n544\n00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:35.580\nfor a certain period of days or\na certain period of inactivity.\n\n545\n00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.230\nIf they haven't used the password for\nan amount of time or\n\n546\n00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:41.950\nif there's been enough failed attempts at\nlogging in, I can disable their account.\n\n547\n00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.000\nSo we can define when user\naccounts get disabled and\n\n548\n00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.154\nwe don't normally mess with that.\n\n549\n00:26:46.154 --> 00:26:47.840\nWe normally just focus on the password.\n\n550\n00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.290\nBut this focuses on the account itself.\n\n551\n00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.850\nAfter that we've got the password\nsettings themselves.\n\n552\n00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:54.890\nDo they have to differ\nfrom the account name?\n\n553\n00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:56.370\nHow many people do that, right?\n\n554\n00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.620\nUsername is deposet,\nI'll just make my password deposet.\n\n555\n00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.670\nThat's easy to remember.\n\n556\n00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.320\nWell, we can stop that.\n\n557\n00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.680\nWe can make it contain\nat least one letter.\n\n558\n00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.800\nOne uppercase and lowercase.\n\n559\n00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.650\nWe can do at least one numeric character,\nand\n\n560\n00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:12.770\none character that isn't a letter or\na number or a special character, right?\n\n561\n00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:16.000\nIf we turn those on, those are all\npretty standard password settings.\n\n562\n00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.750\nUppercase, lowercase, number,\nspecial character, right?\n\n563\n00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.970\nWe need a complex password.\n\n564\n00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:25.580\nYou can say, passwords must be reset\nthe first time the user logs in.\n\n565\n00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:28.900\nI just imported a bunch of users and\nevery one of them has password 123.\n\n566\n00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.430\nIf I check this box, when those guys\ngo to log in with password 123,\n\n567\n00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.100\nit'll make them change their\npassword on the first time.\n\n568\n00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.810\nThere's two benefits to that, right?\n\n569\n00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:40.320\nOne, they'll get a stronger password\nbecause they have to pick it, and\n\n570\n00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.920\ntwo, only they will know their password.\n\n571\n00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.680\nI won't even know their password anymore.\n\n572\n00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.400\nSo now we've got true password security.\n\n573\n00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.840\nThey're the only ones that know what\nthe password to their account is.\n\n574\n00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.690\nYou can set a length limit.\n\n575\n00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.320\nSo maybe I want to limit it so\nit's gotta be eight characters or longer.\n\n576\n00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.650\nYou can make it differ\nfrom previous passwords.\n\n577\n00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:59.970\nHow many people have seen this where,\n\n578\n00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:04.860\nmaybe this month my password is,\nI don't know, Florida one.\n\n579\n00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:08.350\nAnd then next month it's Florida two and\nthen Florida three.\n\n580\n00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:11.560\nAnd then,\nI just go back to Florida one again.\n\n581\n00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.330\nAnd then, Florida two, Florida one,\nFlorida two, just going back and forth.\n\n582\n00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:18.160\nWe can make it differ for\nsay the last five passwords.\n\n583\n00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.530\nSo I can't duplicate a password over and\nover and over.\n\n584\n00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.665\nIf I do it this way, a minimum of five,\nI'd have to say, Florida one,\n\n585\n00:28:24.665 --> 00:28:27.591\nFlorida two, Florida three,\nFlorida four, Florida five, and\n\n586\n00:28:27.591 --> 00:28:29.780\nthen I can jump back to Florida one again.\n\n587\n00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.150\nYour users are gonna\nfigure out that pattern.\n\n588\n00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:33.750\nAnd then you can set the age limit.\n\n589\n00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:37.285\nWe want to reset that password every,\nlet's say two months.\n\n590\n00:28:37.285 --> 00:28:38.967\nRight?\nEvery 60 days we're gonna cause that\n\n591\n00:28:38.967 --> 00:28:39.810\npassword to reset.\n\n592\n00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:42.170\nOr whatever the policy is for\nyour company.\n\n593\n00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.060\nWe can define this and\n\n594\n00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:47.750\nnow our users are gonna have some\nstricter settings that apply to them.\n\n595\n00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:52.440\nSo the next time one of those users\nlogs in, they're gonna have to\n\n596\n00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.970\nmake sure they have a stronger password\nand it meets these requirements, right?\n\n597\n00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:00.576\nAnd we could set limits to their\nuser account too, like hey,\n\n598\n00:29:00.576 --> 00:29:04.763\nif they're inactive for\n30 days then disable the account, right?\n\n599\n00:29:04.763 --> 00:29:07.160\nSo the password might still be valid.\n\n600\n00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.442\nThe password's good for 60 days, but\nif the user hasn't even logged in in\n\n601\n00:29:10.442 --> 00:29:14.400\nan entire month, the odds are that they've\nbeen terminated and nobody told IT.\n\n602\n00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.480\nSo let's just disable their account.\n\n603\n00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.820\nAnd if they weren't terminated,\nthe next time they try and log in,\n\n604\n00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:19.510\nthey won't be able to log in.\n\n605\n00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.520\nIt'll call the help desk and\nwe can figure it out then.\n\n606\n00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:26.950\nBut this'll stop us from having those\naccounts that are technically not useful\n\n607\n00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:32.140\nanymore but are a target for brute force\nattempts or shared passwords or whatever.\n\n608\n00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.130\nRight, so we can set those kind of limits.\n\n609\n00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:39.060\nAnd you can stop brute forces by saying\nif somebody tries multiple times to\n\n610\n00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.850\nlog in with a bad password,\nthen we'll just block the account.\n\n611\n00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:44.630\nAnd then they'll have to call\nthe help desk and we can reset it.\n\n612\n00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:45.230\nRight?\nSo\n\n613\n00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:49.620\nthose are all great ways that we can\nstrengthen the security on those accounts.\n\n614\n00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:53.860\nAnd when we say okay, that's our\nnew open directory password policy.\n\n615\n00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.970\nSo now, we've got that applied and\n\n616\n00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:58.870\nit affects all of the accounts\nright here on our open directory.\n\n617\n00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:59.630\n>> Good information.\n\n618\n00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:01.185\nWe've been talking about\nsome of the properties and\n\n619\n00:30:01.185 --> 00:30:02.680\ncharacteristics of creating\nyour user account.\n\n620\n00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.525\nNow Don, I know we've got a lot more\ninformation to go through when it comes to\n\n621\n00:30:06.525 --> 00:30:08.596\nuser accounts, but looking at the time,\n\n622\n00:30:08.596 --> 00:30:11.340\nit does look we're running\na little bit short on time.\n\n623\n00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.910\nDo you got anything else you might\nwant to put in this episode?\n\n624\n00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:15.490\n>> Yeah, I haven't gotten to groups yet.\n\n625\n00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:16.870\nI wanted to talk a little\nbit about them and\n\n626\n00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:19.700\nI wanted to talk about access control and\ntroubleshooting too.\n\n627\n00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.010\nSo let's bump that all off into part two.\n\n628\n00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:24.242\nI think I've been pretty exhaustive\non the user accounts though.\n\n629\n00:30:24.242 --> 00:30:27.100\nWe talked about the password\npolicies which are important.\n\n630\n00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.500\nI know people hate passwords,\nbut it is important.\n\n631\n00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.040\nIf you use Apple IDs,\nthen all that gets managed by Apple and\n\n632\n00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.120\nit becomes a lot easier.\n\n633\n00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.020\nRight?\nSo, that's kinda the way\n\n634\n00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.380\nthey're starting to push people\nis going to Apple IDs, but\n\n635\n00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.060\nyou can do it all right here\nfrom your own open directory.\n\n636\n00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.220\nYou've got the tools.\n\n637\n00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:42.090\nJust make sure you set it up.\n\n638\n00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:43.350\nIt was all turned off by default.\n\n639\n00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:46.140\nWe had to turn that stuff on to\nget it set the way we wanted it.\n\n640\n00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.360\n>> Well, we appreciate you, the viewer,\nbut we're gonna go ahead and\n\n641\n00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.050\nsign out here.\n\n642\n00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:51.340\nFor IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n643\n00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.590\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n644\n00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:53.548\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n645\n00:30:53.548 --> 00:31:02.380\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.993\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.993 --> 00:00:21.218\nin today's episode we're continuing\non with our OS 10 Server essentials.\n\n5\n00:00:21.218 --> 00:00:24.810\nAnd today, we're actually going\nwith a part two on user accounts.\n\n6\n00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.860\nThat's right, we let Don talk way\ntoo much in the first part so\n\n7\n00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.960\nwe're coming back with a part two.\n\n8\n00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.170\nDon how are you doing today sir?\n\n9\n00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.350\n>> I'm doing great Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.908\nAnd yeah, just ready to pick up where\nI left off in the last episode.\n\n11\n00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:37.798\nIf you didn't watch it, we did a little\nbit deeper of a dive into user accounts.\n\n12\n00:00:37.798 --> 00:00:40.135\nWe've been talking about user\naccounts in a previous episode,\n\n13\n00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:42.038\nbut I wanted to show some\nof the additional options,\n\n14\n00:00:42.038 --> 00:00:44.738\npassword policies, and all that good\nstuff that we got the chance to see.\n\n15\n00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:46.592\nI didn't have a chance to\nget to groups though, so\n\n16\n00:00:46.592 --> 00:00:48.370\nI wanna talk a little bit about groups.\n\n17\n00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.360\nAnd then what I really wanna get\nto is the trouble shooting side.\n\n18\n00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.410\nCuz you can have a lot of problems when\nyou're dealing with open directory\n\n19\n00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.378\naccounts that cause people to not be\nable to log in or access resources.\n\n20\n00:00:57.378 --> 00:01:01.317\nSo those are the kind of things that\nwe wanna tackle here in this episode,\n\n21\n00:01:01.317 --> 00:01:04.160\nbut let's kick it off\ntalking about groups.\n\n22\n00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.590\nNow, for the most part,\neverything I need to say about groups is\n\n23\n00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.100\npretty much the same as what\nI said about user accounts.\n\n24\n00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.900\nYou can create groups on your system and\nyou can have groups that are local groups.\n\n25\n00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.800\nAnd you can have groups\nthat are network groups.\n\n26\n00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.620\nAnd there is a difference, right?\n\n27\n00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.520\nThe local groups are just present\nright here on your own machine.\n\n28\n00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.544\nThe network groups are a part\nof the open directory,\n\n29\n00:01:23.544 --> 00:01:25.440\nand they can be used all over the place.\n\n30\n00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.990\nNow, why would we want to use groups?\n\n31\n00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.140\nThere's a few different reasons for it,\nbut the primary, well then I guess there's\n\n32\n00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.198\ntwo main reasons why we would use it, but\nthe primary reason is for permissions.\n\n33\n00:01:37.198 --> 00:01:40.620\nIf I wanna grant somebody\npermission to access a printer, or\n\n34\n00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.110\npermission to access a shared folder,\nI can do that,\n\n35\n00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.660\nI can do it just right on\nthe individual user account.\n\n36\n00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.070\nBut it's much easier\nif I do it to a group.\n\n37\n00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.690\nBecause I could have 1000\npeople in that group and when I\n\n38\n00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.160\nassign permissions to the group, all 1000\npeople immediately get those permissions.\n\n39\n00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.710\nSo, it makes doing bulk\nadministration tasks a lot\n\n40\n00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.170\neasier than doing things by hand.\n\n41\n00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.140\nThe other thing is, think about\nwhen you add and remove employees.\n\n42\n00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.590\nLet's say I go ahead and do it by hand.\n\n43\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.530\nI've got a thousand employees,\nand so I go in and\n\n44\n00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.510\nI give them all permissions to\naccess this folder and this printer.\n\n45\n00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.630\nEvery time I hire an employee,\nI need to remember to give them those same\n\n46\n00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.790\npermissions, I gotta go to all\nthe various places and set it.\n\n47\n00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.820\nThere's a lot of room for mistakes.\n\n48\n00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.980\nAnd if I ever terminate an employee, I've\ngotta go to all those different places and\n\n49\n00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.360\nremove their permissions to stop them\nfrom having access, or maybe it's not\n\n50\n00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.010\ntermination, maybe they got transferred\nfrom one department to another.\n\n51\n00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.510\nThings get really messy.\n\n52\n00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.370\nIf I just use groups, though,\nI take them out of one group,\n\n53\n00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.920\nI put them into another group.\n\n54\n00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.010\nPermission's done.\n\n55\n00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.520\nAnd now it's consistent.\n\n56\n00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.900\nThe room for error becomes much,\nmuch smaller.\n\n57\n00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.610\nThat's the number one use for groups,\nreducing administrative burden.\n\n58\n00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.090\nBut there's other uses, for example,\n\n59\n00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.590\ngroups can be used as\nemail distribution lists.\n\n60\n00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.115\nIt's not as common, but\nif you're running the Mac mail server,\n\n61\n00:02:53.115 --> 00:02:57.030\nthat's part of the server app, those\ngroups can become distribution lists.\n\n62\n00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.530\nSo now, if I send an email to the group,\n\n63\n00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.910\neverybody in the group\ngets a copy of that email.\n\n64\n00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.408\nIt does require me to be\nrunning the Mac mail server.\n\n65\n00:03:06.408 --> 00:03:10.680\nIf I'm not running the Mac mail server,\nthen the groups don't really help.\n\n66\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.900\nIt doesn't really do anything, right?\n\n67\n00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.090\nBut it does show up in the contacts, and\nso you can then use the contact as a group\n\n68\n00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.030\nto forward in, and so there's kinda\nways that you can make it work.\n\n69\n00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.760\nBut it's not as flexible unless you have\n\n70\n00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.900\nthe mail server running from\ninside of the server app.\n\n71\n00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.541\nAll right, well,\nlet's take a look at these groups, and\n\n72\n00:03:26.541 --> 00:03:28.050\nwe'll kinda see how this all plays out.\n\n73\n00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.362\nNow, I know I can go into\nSystem Preference and\n\n74\n00:03:30.362 --> 00:03:33.918\ninside of System Preferences,\nI can go on to my Users and Groups panel,\n\n75\n00:03:33.918 --> 00:03:36.100\nI showed this in the last episode.\n\n76\n00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.950\nAnd we normally create user accounts,\nright?\n\n77\n00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.500\nBut I can also come in here and\nI can add a group.\n\n78\n00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.060\nBut this is gonna be a local only group.\n\n79\n00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.390\nIt's gonna be right here on this system.\n\n80\n00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.508\nSo if I create a group called Students,\nright?\n\n81\n00:03:48.508 --> 00:03:53.310\nI can create that one, and now it shows\nup right here, and I can add users to it.\n\n82\n00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.172\nWell, what about the account that I made\nfor Wes Bryan in the last episode, or\n\n83\n00:03:58.172 --> 00:04:00.737\nDave Mustaine for that matter,\nor all those guys?\n\n84\n00:04:00.737 --> 00:04:02.095\nThey don't even show up.\n\n85\n00:04:02.095 --> 00:04:07.130\nAnd that's because a local group\ncan only contain local users.\n\n86\n00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.760\nThose other guys are network users, and\na local group can't contain network users,\n\n87\n00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.500\nso I can't use it, right?\n\n88\n00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.140\nNow, when we're here in\nthe System Preference screen like this,\n\n89\n00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.790\nit makes sense.\n\n90\n00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.610\nWe know that we're\ndealing with local stuff.\n\n91\n00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.130\nWhere it gets confusing\nis in the Server app.\n\n92\n00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.479\nBecause in the Server app, when you\ngo to Groups, you're seeing local and\n\n93\n00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.008\nnetwork at the same time.\n\n94\n00:04:27.008 --> 00:04:29.110\nI see Workgroup.\n\n95\n00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.680\nThat's a network group, one that contains\nevery person in the open directory.\n\n96\n00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.930\nSo, this is like, everyone.\n\n97\n00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.550\nAnd then Students,\nthat's the one I made on the local side.\n\n98\n00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.982\nAnd I can scroll over here and see where\nit says that that's a local account, or\n\n99\n00:04:40.982 --> 00:04:41.659\na local group.\n\n100\n00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.020\nSo when I create new groups,\n\n101\n00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.120\nit's really important that I\npick the right place to put it.\n\n102\n00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.718\nSo if I want to create a group called Show\nHosts, for example, I need to make sure\n\n103\n00:04:51.718 --> 00:04:56.480\nthat I choose that it's gonna be a Network\nor a Local account and get that correct.\n\n104\n00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.020\nI can't change it after the fact.\n\n105\n00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.960\nYou just have to delete it and\ncreate it again, right?\n\n106\n00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.410\nSo you can't change it.\n\n107\n00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.930\nI'm gonna create one here\ncalled Show Hosts, and\n\n108\n00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.260\nin this group I'm gonna put in users\nlike Wes, or me, or whoever, right?\n\n109\n00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.030\nNow, it gives it a group name\njust like user accounts,\n\n110\n00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.350\nyou have the Full Name and\nthe Unix type account name, right?\n\n111\n00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.010\nYour end users will probably never\nsee this but it does have it so\n\n112\n00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.149\nyou've gotta make sure you provide that.\n\n113\n00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.740\nIf you want it to be a Mailing List,\nif you want it to be\n\n114\n00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.670\nused as a distribution we need\nto attach an email address.\n\n115\n00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.500\nJust like you can attach email\naddresses to user accounts.\n\n116\n00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.260\nSo I might add an address called\nhosts@lab.itpro.tv like that, right?\n\n117\n00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.740\nAnd now if somebody sends\nan email to hosts@lab.itpro.tv,\n\n118\n00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.490\nit will be distributed to all\nof the users inside of it.\n\n119\n00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.780\nIf I'm running the Mac mail server.\n\n120\n00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.280\nIf I'm not running the Mac mail server,\nthen all this'll do is work as creating\n\n121\n00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.415\na group in my contacts, so that when I\nsend to that, it'll go to whatever mail\n\n122\n00:05:56.415 --> 00:06:00.680\nserver's out there to try and get to\nthe end users, and it may or may not work.\n\n123\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.200\nThere is one little option right\nhere that's kind of important.\n\n124\n00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.390\nAllow mail from non-group members.\n\n125\n00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.480\nBy default, only the group members\nare allowed to use the group.\n\n126\n00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.440\nSo if Wes is a show host and I'm a show\nhost, we can send email to this group, and\n\n127\n00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.400\nall the other show hosts would get it.\n\n128\n00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.120\nBut if one of you, the viewers out there,\n\n129\n00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.700\nsent an email, it'd be rejected\nbecause you're not in the group.\n\n130\n00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.700\nSo if I want this to be a public\ngroup that's used by everybody,\n\n131\n00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.020\nI need to check that.\n\n132\n00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.835\nAnd this is one of those options\nthat can be turned on later, so\n\n133\n00:06:27.835 --> 00:06:31.028\nyou can change this one, change your mind,\nturn it on, turn it off but\n\n134\n00:06:31.028 --> 00:06:34.798\nthat's an important one to set if you want\nexternal users to be able to email to it.\n\n135\n00:06:34.798 --> 00:06:38.645\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsay OK to create that, and I just got,\n\n136\n00:06:38.645 --> 00:06:41.518\nOperation not supported by directory node.\n\n137\n00:06:41.518 --> 00:06:44.058\nOkay, why is that?\n\n138\n00:06:44.058 --> 00:06:46.543\nWell, it's because I'm not\nrunning the Mac mail server and\n\n139\n00:06:46.543 --> 00:06:49.578\nI'm telling it to create a mailing list\non it, so it's a little mad at me.\n\n140\n00:06:49.578 --> 00:06:55.618\nSo, let me just turn that off and\nget rid of that and then I'll say OK.\n\n141\n00:06:55.618 --> 00:06:57.898\nWell, that's kind of embarrassing, this\nis one of the easier things to do, right?\n\n142\n00:06:57.898 --> 00:06:59.397\nYou type in a name, you hit OK.\n\n143\n00:06:59.397 --> 00:07:01.710\nIt's not like there's a lot\nof options to screw up so.\n\n144\n00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.960\nThere's one thing I can think of here is,\nI'm logged in with a local user account\n\n145\n00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.600\nand I'm technically performing\na directory action, and\n\n146\n00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.200\nthis has been a two part episode so\nI've been logged in a long time.\n\n147\n00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.116\nI actually have directory\ncredentials that probably expired,\n\n148\n00:07:15.116 --> 00:07:17.817\nand that's probably why it's\nnot letting me create this.\n\n149\n00:07:17.817 --> 00:07:20.771\nAnd I'm getting this failed operation\non node, which means I'm probably not\n\n150\n00:07:20.771 --> 00:07:22.977\nactually talking to the directory\nlike I'm supposed to.\n\n151\n00:07:22.977 --> 00:07:24.017\nSo, easy fix for that.\n\n152\n00:07:24.017 --> 00:07:24.657\nLet me show you this.\n\n153\n00:07:24.657 --> 00:07:27.530\nIt's just close the Server app and\nrelaunch it, right?\n\n154\n00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.470\nSo I'm gonna get out of the Server app.\n\n155\n00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.740\nI'll just quit that and\n\n156\n00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.600\nI'll relaunch it, cuz that's gonna let\nme re-authenticate against it, right?\n\n157\n00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.950\nSo I'm gonna connect up to the Server app,\nand\n\n158\n00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.990\nyou'll see where I'm just logging in as\nDon Pazet, that's my local account, but\n\n159\n00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.480\nthat's okay because I've got\nthe diradmin access, right?\n\n160\n00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.390\nFor that directory admin.\n\n161\n00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.500\nSo it's gonna authenticate\nagainst the server.\n\n162\n00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.958\nI'll go right back into my groups and\nI'll create this.\n\n163\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:56.558\nAnd, so I'm gonna create that Show Hosts\ngroup, and I'll hit OK on that.\n\n164\n00:07:56.558 --> 00:07:57.478\nAnd there we go.\n\n165\n00:07:57.478 --> 00:07:59.438\nSee how it's prompting me for diradmin?\n\n166\n00:07:59.438 --> 00:08:01.126\nSo my session had expired before and\n\n167\n00:08:01.126 --> 00:08:03.330\nthat's why it wasn't prompting me for\nthis.\n\n168\n00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.875\nSo now I can provide that diradmin\naccount which I've already saved, so\n\n169\n00:08:06.875 --> 00:08:09.443\nI can just authenticate,\nand then we can have that.\n\n170\n00:08:09.443 --> 00:08:11.789\nSo [LAUGH].\n\n171\n00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:14.320\nThis is gonna be like a comedy of errors,\nWes.\n\n172\n00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.190\n>> You know, Don, one of the things that\nI was actually thinking in taking a trip\n\n173\n00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.190\ndown memory lane.\n\n174\n00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.949\nIf I remember right, in the first episode,\nyou actually set a password policy that\n\n175\n00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:23.993\nwas implementing things\nlike complexity and\n\n176\n00:08:23.993 --> 00:08:26.481\nalso requiring your users\nto change their passwords.\n\n177\n00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:27.740\n>> [LAUGH] Shoot.\n\n178\n00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.540\nSo, this is the whole bad host memory.\n\n179\n00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.700\nSo we did, we set a password policy and\n\n180\n00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.060\nsomething kind of interesting\nabout that policy.\n\n181\n00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.600\nIt hasn't affected me, right?\n\n182\n00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.880\nI've been working just fine.\n\n183\n00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.050\nNow, I'm trying to log as diradmin and\ndiradmin can't log in.\n\n184\n00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:42.600\nI know that's the right password.\n\n185\n00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.090\nWhat the heck's going on there?\n\n186\n00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:48.810\nWell, the password policy that we created,\nwas an open directory password policy.\n\n187\n00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.020\nIt's applying to open directory accounts.\n\n188\n00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.190\nDiradmin is an open directory account.\n\n189\n00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.300\nMy account's an admin also.\n\n190\n00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.780\nI'm an administrator.\n\n191\n00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.460\nBut not an open directory admin.\n\n192\n00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.230\nI'm an administrator on the local machine.\n\n193\n00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.090\nI have a local account,\nnot a local network account.\n\n194\n00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.650\nSo the password policy\ndoesn't apply to me.\n\n195\n00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.910\nThat's why I'm able to log in just fine.\n\n196\n00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.550\nBut diradmin is not.\n\n197\n00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.330\nAnd I'll bet, because we set it to require\nthe password to change the first time,\n\n198\n00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:12.920\nit's wanting me to do that.\n\n199\n00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.850\nAnd this particular screen\nwon't let you do that,\n\n200\n00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:15.990\nit won't let you change that password.\n\n201\n00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.580\nSo, we can fix that pretty easy.\n\n202\n00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.870\nLet me use my fast user switching here,\nand I'm gonna log in as diradmin\n\n203\n00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:26.670\nreal quick, and we'll more than likely\nsee it ask us to reset that password.\n\n204\n00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:31.270\nSo I'm just gonna log in as diradmin,\nand when I go to log in, sure enough,\n\n205\n00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.090\nthere it is, right?\n\n206\n00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.240\nSo even though they're an administrator,\n\n207\n00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.620\nbecause they're in the open\ndirectory they're effected.\n\n208\n00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.690\nSo, normal admins,\nlocal admins, are not affected,\n\n209\n00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.490\nthe password policy doesn't apply to them.\n\n210\n00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.430\nBut I need to punch in a new password\nthat meets the requirements.\n\n211\n00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:49.580\nSo I can't use my normal password, all\nlowercase, but I'll come in and punch that\n\n212\n00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:55.560\nin and now diradmin's got an updated\npassword and should be able log in.\n\n213\n00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.690\nSo, what I should find, and\nI'm laying it on heavy here Wes,\n\n214\n00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:02.190\nI'm doing my IT should, this should work,\n\n215\n00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:07.430\nthat once I get in here now I should be\nable to go in and create that account.\n\n216\n00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.210\nNow, when I logged in it's\ngiving me a warning here.\n\n217\n00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.309\nOS 10 needs to repair your\nlibrary to run applications.\n\n218\n00:10:12.309 --> 00:10:14.800\nI've never actually logged as this user,\nso it's not about repairing a library,\n\n219\n00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.130\nit's about building it in the first place.\n\n220\n00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:20.157\nI'm just gonna ignore that and\ngo back to me.\n\n221\n00:10:20.157 --> 00:10:22.680\nAnd now I should be able\nto log in as diradmin.\n\n222\n00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.480\nI hope so, because we're starting\nto run out of possible problems.\n\n223\n00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don, I could think that this would\n\n224\n00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.440\nprobably be something you'd want\nto document if you're ever gonna\n\n225\n00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.150\ndo a password policy change,\nand it's gonna lock you out\n\n226\n00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.120\nof even the administrator that has access\nto the database in the first place.\n\n227\n00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.140\n>> [LAUGHS] It potentially could, yeah,\nyou'd need to go and change that password.\n\n228\n00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.660\nSo all right, there we go, so\n\n229\n00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.360\nnow it created it, we just kind of\nneeded to get past that password policy,\n\n230\n00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.390\nnow I've got my Show Host group, and\nI'm ready to start putting people into it.\n\n231\n00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.360\nNow, how do I get people in to it?\n\n232\n00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.630\nWell, there's two different ways.\n\n233\n00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.320\nI can edit the group and I can add\nthe users from inside of the group, or\n\n234\n00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.150\nI can edit the users and\nadd the group to the users.\n\n235\n00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.120\nIt just depends on which one's easier.\n\n236\n00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.260\nIf I have ten people I\nneed to put in this group,\n\n237\n00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.280\nit's easier to edit the group\nthen it is ten people.\n\n238\n00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.140\nBut if I have one person I\nwant to put in 10 groups,\n\n239\n00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.690\nit's easier to edit the person\nthan it is the group, right?\n\n240\n00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.708\nSo you pick which ever one is easier.\n\n241\n00:11:13.708 --> 00:11:17.060\nIf I edit the group like this here,\nI'll just take Show Host and double-click\n\n242\n00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:21.780\non it, and right in here I see the options\nwe saw when we were setting it up, right?\n\n243\n00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.600\nWhether if it's a mailing\nlist whether we allow mail.\n\n244\n00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.210\nAnd I see a lot of other options.\n\n245\n00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.760\nLike keywords and\nnotes that I didn't see before.\n\n246\n00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.030\nWe can make group members\nMessages buddies.\n\n247\n00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.710\nSo if we have messages set up or\nthe iMessage or\n\n248\n00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.790\nthe Chat system we can make them\nchat buddies automatically.\n\n249\n00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.120\nWe can make give the group\na shared folder.\n\n250\n00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.620\nSo if you're in that group you'll have\naccess to a particular shared folder.\n\n251\n00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.440\nI can add numbers, and\nthat's what I'm really looking for.\n\n252\n00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.980\nAnd I can come in here and\nadd Wes or Dave Mustaine or\n\n253\n00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:57.220\nwhoever it is that I want to add and\nget them put into the group.\n\n254\n00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:57.970\nWhoops.\n\n255\n00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.390\nIf I can click on it, there we go.\n\n256\n00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.880\nThen I can add each person that way.\n\n257\n00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.920\nSo, that's probably the easiest\nway to add people into the group.\n\n258\n00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.610\nBut I could have also done it from Users.\n\n259\n00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:10.570\nSo I could come in here, and I could take,\nwe'll take old Dave Mustaine again.\n\n260\n00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.120\nAnd right here I can see\nthe groups that he's a part of.\n\n261\n00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.030\nAnd I can add, and I can specify\n\n262\n00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:21.380\nthat he is gonna be a show host, or\nwhatever, and put him in that group.\n\n263\n00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.700\nEither way it gets the user in the group.\n\n264\n00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.280\nAnd now they've got permissions and\naccess based on what that group has.\n\n265\n00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.970\n>> All right, Don.\nI've got a scenario for you.\n\n266\n00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.620\nLet's say we're going corporate takeover.\n\n267\n00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.378\nWe've just taken over a company and\n\n268\n00:12:32.378 --> 00:12:35.260\nwe've now got 50 new groups\nthat we need to put in place.\n\n269\n00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:39.543\nNow, you've shown us how to go through\nthe process manually step by step creating\n\n270\n00:12:39.543 --> 00:12:43.264\na group, is there a way that you could\nmake it a little bit, I would say,\n\n271\n00:12:43.264 --> 00:12:47.072\nless of an administrative effort,\nin maybe 50 groups creating them?\n\n272\n00:12:47.072 --> 00:12:49.625\n>> Yeah, and just like we did with users,\nwhere we imported that file and\n\n273\n00:12:49.625 --> 00:12:51.992\nbrought them in, you can do\nthe same thing with groups, right?\n\n274\n00:12:51.992 --> 00:12:54.590\nThe format's a little bit different, and\nagain, I'll put it in the show notes for\n\n275\n00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.550\nyou guys, but let me bring this up here.\n\n276\n00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:01.740\nI've got a little text file and I will try\nand zoom this in a bit so we can see it.\n\n277\n00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.510\nThat's formatted the very\nspecific way they want it, right.\n\n278\n00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:08.550\nSo it's got the little header that\nindicates we're creating groups and\n\n279\n00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.150\nthen it's got three records, right.\n\n280\n00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.930\nThe RecordName, the Password and\nthe GroupMembership.\n\n281\n00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:17.250\nNow the password for\na group doesn't really ever get used, so\n\n282\n00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.370\nI'm gonna create a group\nhere called the-band.\n\n283\n00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.530\nApparently the-band two for some reason.\n\n284\n00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.940\nSo we'll create one called the-band,\nand then we'll do password123 for\n\n285\n00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:25.730\nits password.\n\n286\n00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:29.060\nI know I'm never really gonna use that\npassword, but we need to assign one.\n\n287\n00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.190\nAnd then after that,\n\n288\n00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.350\nthese are the user accounts that\nare gonna get put in that group.\n\n289\n00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.410\nSo not only can I create groups, but\n\n290\n00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:39.900\nI can put people in them all\nright here from a text file.\n\n291\n00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.320\nAnd save myself a lot of time, right?\n\n292\n00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.650\nAnd all we have to do is in the Server\napp, you go into the Group section and\n\n293\n00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:49.535\ndown at the bottom you can hit\nyour gear and go to Import Groups.\n\n294\n00:13:49.535 --> 00:13:52.950\nAnd when you import,\nyou can just specify that file,\n\n295\n00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:57.460\nmine is this groups.txt file, you can\nspecify if you want it to be a local or\n\n296\n00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.610\na directory group, and\nI've changed my derivment admin password.\n\n297\n00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:06.400\nSo make sure that's correct, and\nthen we can import them into the system.\n\n298\n00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.060\nAnd when we import them,\nit's gonna load that up.\n\n299\n00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.550\nIt goes by pretty quickly, and\nthen the group should appear, all right?\n\n300\n00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:16.899\nNow if the group doesn't appear,\nthen one of two things happened, right?\n\n301\n00:14:16.899 --> 00:14:20.508\nEither one, it failed to create for\nsome reason, we got an error, or\n\n302\n00:14:20.508 --> 00:14:22.760\ntwo, the screen just hasn't refreshed.\n\n303\n00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.560\nAnd I'll bet I got an error on mine so\nI'm just gonna do a manual refresh.\n\n304\n00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.310\nIf you go up here to View and\nRefresh or Cmd+R, it'll update.\n\n305\n00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:34.769\nThe problem that I think I have here is\nthe password wasn't strong enough, right?\n\n306\n00:14:34.769 --> 00:14:37.783\nWe need a password that meets the password\ncomplexity requirements and so\n\n307\n00:14:37.783 --> 00:14:39.380\nthat one kind of got broke.\n\n308\n00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.620\nCouple options,\nI could turn off the password policy,\n\n309\n00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:46.490\nthat would be the easier solution, or\nI can go in here and edit the file and\n\n310\n00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:50.730\ngive it a stronger password, something\nthat meets the requirements, right?\n\n311\n00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:59.060\nSo we'll do something like that,\nand now, we can redo that import.\n\n312\n00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.350\nNow if I didn't know what the error was,\n\n313\n00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.900\nif I was just completely clueless of\nwhat happened, I'd go to my sys log.\n\n314\n00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.700\nAnd it'll be in there.\n\n315\n00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.530\nThat's where the error would actually\nbe logged, but in this case,\n\n316\n00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.950\nI think I already know what the error is.\n\n317\n00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:15.190\nSo we'll just give that a shot, and\nretry that import and bring it in.\n\n318\n00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:20.475\nAnd so when it goes to bring it in,\ncome on.\n\n319\n00:15:20.475 --> 00:15:22.550\nI have to know my password apparently.\n\n320\n00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.030\nI told it local instead of network,\n\n321\n00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.070\neven though I reminded\neverybody to double check that.\n\n322\n00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:29.610\nAnd so now it's gonna go and import and\nhopefully that'll show up and\n\n323\n00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:30.570\nwe'll get that account.\n\n324\n00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:33.110\nOkay, once that's done,\nyou've imported a group, and\n\n325\n00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.230\nyou can import hundreds or\nthousands of groups.\n\n326\n00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.340\nYou can have groups with tons of\nmembership all brought in via that text\n\n327\n00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.820\nfile, and you get it in, and\nget it in place, all right?\n\n328\n00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:46.560\nNow mine still hasn't shown up, and just\ndoing a refresh there and not seeing it.\n\n329\n00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.360\nSo we can dive under logs and\ntake a look and see what happened.\n\n330\n00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.678\nIt should be one of the last\nevents in the logs.\n\n331\n00:15:50.678 --> 00:15:52.910\nSo when we went to bring that in,\n\n332\n00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:57.898\nsomething went wrong and we should be\nable to find it in here somewhere.\n\n333\n00:15:57.898 --> 00:16:01.598\nThe trick is to kinda sift through\nthe logs and locate where that error is.\n\n334\n00:16:01.598 --> 00:16:07.646\nSo there will likely be something in\nhere where I have left something out and\n\n335\n00:16:07.646 --> 00:16:12.930\nthe hard part here is trying to\nfind where that actual problem is.\n\n336\n00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.930\nThese are mostly generic errors here.\n\n337\n00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.120\nGet state requests and so on.\n\n338\n00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.050\nYou know, I'm not seeing it.\n\n339\n00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:22.330\nSo we'll have to dig through and\nsee if we can't find out where that is.\n\n340\n00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.160\nAnd it'll more than likely be\nin our open directory log.\n\n341\n00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.520\nSo I'm gonna go under open directory.\n\n342\n00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.810\nAnd you'll see where you've\ngot your configuration,\n\n343\n00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:31.030\nLDAP, the main log,\npassword service errors.\n\n344\n00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.060\nThat's probably where I'd\nsee if I'd password errors.\n\n345\n00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.930\nI'm gonna go to the open directory log.\n\n346\n00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.730\nLet that filter down a bit.\n\n347\n00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:41.560\nAnd yeah, not really seeing\nanything jumping out at me here.\n\n348\n00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.268\nIt's possible it did create it and\nit's just not showing up but\n\n349\n00:16:44.268 --> 00:16:45.760\nit usually shows up pretty quick.\n\n350\n00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.590\nWell at some point that'll turn up and\nwe'll see it.\n\n351\n00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:50.490\nI am gonna left that sit for\n\n352\n00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:52.760\na minute and we'll come back,\njust in case I'm being impatient.\n\n353\n00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:57.260\nThat happens sometimes, I need to\nmake sure that my group name is okay.\n\n354\n00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.730\nThat all should be all right.\n\n355\n00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:02.240\nAny number of little things\ncan cause this to fail, so\n\n356\n00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.524\nI wonder if my exclamation point\nmaybe went a little too far.\n\n357\n00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:07.270\n[LAUGH] So,\n\n358\n00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:11.080\nit can be the simplest things sometimes\nthat stop those groups from coming in.\n\n359\n00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.010\nAnd so I'll just try one more time and\nif that still doesn't work,\n\n360\n00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.500\nthen we'll just let it sit for\na minute and come back to it.\n\n361\n00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:21.360\nAll right, so while we're waiting on that,\nlet's talk about troubleshooting, right?\n\n362\n00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.170\nSo when we go to troubleshoot\nan issue like this,\n\n363\n00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:28.440\nthere's several different moving pieces\nthat are involved in the event, right?\n\n364\n00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.750\nSo there's open directory.\n\n365\n00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.130\nThere's the operating system itself.\n\n366\n00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:32.200\nThere's the server app.\n\n367\n00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:36.840\nThere's a ton of different things that can\ngo wrong and so if you ever have a user\n\n368\n00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.810\nthat can't authenticate, that can't\nlog in, what are the things we check?\n\n369\n00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.310\nWell we've actually seen it\nin the last several minutes,\n\n370\n00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.670\nsome of the things we check.\n\n371\n00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:47.490\nOur password policy could be a problem,\nand that's really hard to see with service\n\n372\n00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.970\naccounts because you might not\nget the password change prompt,\n\n373\n00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:53.230\nyou just kind of have to know that,\nhey I know my password policy requires\n\n374\n00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:56.430\nchanging the password on first log in,\nthat may be the issue here.\n\n375\n00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.670\nRight?\n\n376\n00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.870\nWe can also have issues with\naccounts being disabled.\n\n377\n00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.550\nWe talked about that in the last episode,\nyou can disable an account, the user might\n\n378\n00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:08.030\nbe using the right name and password, but\nthey've been disabled for some reason.\n\n379\n00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.050\nToo many incorrect passwords or whatever.\n\n380\n00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.760\nThe password policies can\nreally impact things.\n\n381\n00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.210\nSo, always be aware of that.\n\n382\n00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.580\nBut for troubleshooting purposes you\ncan disable the password policy and\n\n383\n00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.510\nthen come and\nturn it back on again after the fact.\n\n384\n00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.240\nThat's one way we could\nestablish this really quickly.\n\n385\n00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.020\nThe logs are another, but\nthe logs can be a little challenging.\n\n386\n00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.840\nSo we go to our logs,\n\n387\n00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.920\nthe biggest problem that we have is just\nthe sheer amount of information we get.\n\n388\n00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.019\nHow many of these log entries pertain\nto me doing that group report?\n\n389\n00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.130\nWell, apparently none cuz\nI don't see the error, but\n\n390\n00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.720\nit could be many, it could be few.\n\n391\n00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.230\nWe don't know.\n\n392\n00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.380\nIt just really gets messy.\n\n393\n00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.680\nAnd so when you look in here it\nhopefully will filter out enough for\n\n394\n00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.820\nyou to be able to find\nout where the problem is.\n\n395\n00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.760\nBut if it's like me,\nI'm not seeing my problem here.\n\n396\n00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.210\nAnd it doesn't mean\nthe problem isn't here.\n\n397\n00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:54.760\nI could just be overlooking it.\n\n398\n00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.970\nBecause the log is pretty full.\n\n399\n00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.592\nActually, this is probably the closest\nI've gotten to seeing any problems,\n\n400\n00:19:02.592 --> 00:19:06.310\nis where we've got a password change for\ndir admin.\n\n401\n00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.340\nRight?\nThat's where I reset my password.\n\n402\n00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.260\nAnd then after that,\nwe've got some delete keys.\n\n403\n00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:15.030\nBut I wasn't deleting any groups and\nthen we got an index failure on CSN, so\n\n404\n00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.960\nyeah, none of that actually\neven pertains to my problem.\n\n405\n00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.360\nBut here we can see those account\npolicy violations, right?\n\n406\n00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.780\nSo when dir admin was trying to login and\n\n407\n00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.380\nI kept getting those errors I\ncould've looked right here and\n\n408\n00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.770\nI would've seen it was a policy violation,\nso that's where we can spot that.\n\n409\n00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.810\nNever underestimate your logs.\n\n410\n00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:34.020\nOkay, now, let's say I didn't see that.\n\n411\n00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.530\nRight, and my password was right and\nI still couldn't log in.\n\n412\n00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:41.020\nOne real common source\nof problem is Kerberos.\n\n413\n00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:45.440\nI think I mentioned this in one of the\nearlier episodes that Kerberos is really,\n\n414\n00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.640\nreally tied to a timestamp.\n\n415\n00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:52.100\nThat if a user's workstation's\nclock Is off by more than\n\n416\n00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:56.430\na few minutes from what the server's\nclock is, they may fail to authenticate.\n\n417\n00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:02.180\nSo it may be the right username,\nthe right password, everything's right,\n\n418\n00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.810\nbut the clock is wrong and\nI'll tell you where I see this the most.\n\n419\n00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:09.660\nYou get a computer and\nthe clock is set to Pacific time.\n\n420\n00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:17.960\nAnd so, an end user says well Pacific\nis UTC minus, what is it, minus eight?\n\n421\n00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.120\nAnd if you're in the East coast,\n\n422\n00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.450\nhere in the U.S.,\nthen you need the UTC minus five.\n\n423\n00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:25.430\nIt's a three hour difference\nbetween us and California.\n\n424\n00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:26.630\nSo a user,\n\n425\n00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:31.360\ninstead of moving the computer from\nPacific to Eastern time zone Just goes and\n\n426\n00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.560\nlowers the clock by three hours or raises\nthe clock by three hours is what you do.\n\n427\n00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:41.460\nSo, if they do that, now their clock\nis three hours off from the server and\n\n428\n00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.630\nwhen a Kerberos ticket passes the network\nand it's got a timestamp that's\n\n429\n00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:48.770\nthree hours off, Kerberos assumes\nthat it's a replay attack.\n\n430\n00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.050\nThat somebody intercepted that\ntraffic three hours ago and\n\n431\n00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:55.820\nis replaying it now to spoof\nan authentication sequence.\n\n432\n00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.390\nIt's a type of attack that can be done,\nand the timestamp protects us from that.\n\n433\n00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:00.770\nAnd so it blocks it.\n\n434\n00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:04.070\nSo if a user's clock is wrong\nit can stop this from working.\n\n435\n00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.720\nIf we wanna see that,\nwe will usually check the clock right.\n\n436\n00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.235\nYou can go into your clock settings and\nverify.\n\n437\n00:21:09.235 --> 00:21:10.940\nIt'll usually show up in the logs too,\n\n438\n00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.660\nright here where i am seeing\nthese account policy violations.\n\n439\n00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:17.820\nA lot of times we will see the time\nmismatch, it'll show as a replay attack.\n\n440\n00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.570\nThe Kerberos side for\nmost of us is fairly invisible but\n\n441\n00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:24.690\nthere are little parts\nthat rear their head.\n\n442\n00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:30.000\nAnother example would be if you have\na master Open Directory server and\n\n443\n00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.910\na bunch of replicas.\n\n444\n00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:34.780\nAnd if the network goes\ndown between a replica and\n\n445\n00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.230\nthe master, they stop updating.\n\n446\n00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.310\nAnd so, you might create\nan account on the master, and\n\n447\n00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.780\nit doesn't make it down to the replica,\nand the user is going to log in and\n\n448\n00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.870\nthey are authenticating against the\nreplica and their account doesn't exist.\n\n449\n00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:48.660\nThat's a really hard one to track down.\n\n450\n00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.080\nLet me show you a neat little\ncommand that can help with that.\n\n451\n00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.728\nIf you're logged in with the Directory\nuser, so I'm gonna switch over to the dir\n\n452\n00:21:54.728 --> 00:21:58.940\nadmin account again, because my Don Pezet\nuser, that's a local account, that's not\n\n453\n00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:03.430\ngonna help us, I'm not using Kerberos, I'm\njust using Apple's local authentication.\n\n454\n00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.580\nBut if I log in with their admin,\nthat is a directory account and\n\n455\n00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.190\nif I open up the terminal, you know what,\n\n456\n00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:13.210\nit's just gonna keep pestering\nme until I update that.\n\n457\n00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:17.860\nAnd if I log in with the terminal [LAUGH]\nyou know what?\n\n458\n00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.290\nLet me just do that,\nmove that kinda over here.\n\n459\n00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.690\nAnd [LAUGH] there we go.\n\n460\n00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:24.430\nIf I log in and\n\n461\n00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:28.920\nget into the terminal, there's a little\ncommand called klist, all right?\n\n462\n00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:33.680\nIf you run klist, that will show\nyou your Kerberos ticket ticket.\n\n463\n00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.280\nAnd most of us don't\ncare about the ticket.\n\n464\n00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.200\nI know it works.\n\n465\n00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.290\nWhen I run a process,\nit shows it being tied to me.\n\n466\n00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.440\nThat's great, but\n\n467\n00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:45.740\nthe nice thing about this is it tells you\nwhat server you authenticated against.\n\n468\n00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:49.500\nI can see that I got a Kerberos\nticket granting ticket.\n\n469\n00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.020\nA TGT, right?\n\n470\n00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.948\nWe talked about those in the open\ndirectory episode, I got a TGT and\n\n471\n00:22:53.948 --> 00:22:55.862\nI got it from OSX-Server01.\n\n472\n00:22:55.862 --> 00:22:58.110\nI know what server I logged into.\n\n473\n00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.380\nDid I log into the master?\n\n474\n00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.680\nDid I log into a replica?\n\n475\n00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.550\nWhere did I log in?\n\n476\n00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:04.380\nklist, that'll tell you, right.\n\n477\n00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.570\nLog in with a network account and\nrun klist.\n\n478\n00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:11.520\nIf you log in with a user account that's\na local account, let me show you on mine.\n\n479\n00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.310\nSo if I switch back to my own just\nregular old local account and\n\n480\n00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:22.870\nI jump into terminal and I run klist,\nno credential cache found, right?\n\n481\n00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:24.480\nCuz I'm not logged in\nwith a Kerberos account.\n\n482\n00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.850\nI'm not logged in to the open directory.\n\n483\n00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:29.390\nI'm just a local administrator,\na local account on the system, right?\n\n484\n00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:31.120\nSo, a great way to test and\n\n485\n00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.315\ncheck, am I logged in with a network\naccount or am I logged in locally?\n\n486\n00:23:35.315 --> 00:23:39.370\nCuz other commands like whoami,\nwhoami just says what your user name is,\n\n487\n00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.360\ndoesn't really tell you if you're\nlogged into the network or not.\n\n488\n00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.890\nBut klist, you'll see that ticket and\nyou'll see more information in there.\n\n489\n00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.148\nYou'll see things like when\nthat ticket was issued.\n\n490\n00:23:49.148 --> 00:23:52.588\nSo remember how I mentioned my\ncredentials were expired earlier?\n\n491\n00:23:52.588 --> 00:23:55.828\nYou can see how long ago\nthat ticket was issued.\n\n492\n00:23:55.828 --> 00:23:57.388\nAnd when it expires.\n\n493\n00:23:57.388 --> 00:24:00.610\nSo my ticket was issued at 11:13.\n\n494\n00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.632\nIt expires at 21:13, right?\n\n495\n00:24:03.632 --> 00:24:05.930\nSo it was a ten hour ticket.\n\n496\n00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.700\nIn ten hours I need to\nrenew that ticket or\n\n497\n00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.680\nI'm not gonna be able to run applications.\n\n498\n00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.630\nAnd so\nthat's what happens when it expires.\n\n499\n00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:16.170\nAnd if I lose communication with\nthe server, that ticket will expire and\n\n500\n00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.720\nthen I won't be able to\naccess network resources.\n\n501\n00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.839\nThose are all different things that\nkind of get in between you and\n\n502\n00:24:21.839 --> 00:24:23.410\naccessing a network resource.\n\n503\n00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:27.401\n>> Don, you've shown us, told us\nthat you can check the time clocks,\n\n504\n00:24:27.401 --> 00:24:30.202\nis there any way that if I've got for\ninstance,\n\n505\n00:24:30.202 --> 00:24:34.896\nmaybe a few machines that their time\nsynchronization, I wouldn't want to have\n\n506\n00:24:34.896 --> 00:24:39.052\nto go to every individual machine and\nset the time or re-set the time.\n\n507\n00:24:39.052 --> 00:24:42.850\nIs there a way that we could maybe\napply this to a bulk set of machines?\n\n508\n00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:46.820\n>> Yeah, ideally, what you wanna do is\nnot set your clocks yourself, right.\n\n509\n00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.420\nYou wanna use something like NTP,\nthe Network Time Protocol, right.\n\n510\n00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.850\nNTP servers, your Mac should be set for\nit by default.\n\n511\n00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:55.570\nSo by default, out of the box,\nit should be set for NTP.\n\n512\n00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:59.640\nSo like if I jump into my\nSystem Preferences, and we go in here, and\n\n513\n00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:04.902\nwe jump into our clock settings, which are\nway down here at the bottom, Date & Time.\n\n514\n00:25:04.902 --> 00:25:09.162\nIf I go into Date & Time, what you\nshould see is that it set date and\n\n515\n00:25:09.162 --> 00:25:10.890\ntime automatically.\n\n516\n00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:14.640\nRight, that it's gonna pull\nit from time.apple.com.\n\n517\n00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.610\nSo you shouldn't adjust\nyour clock yourself.\n\n518\n00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:19.750\nIf you adjust your clock in\nan Open Directory environment,\n\n519\n00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.820\nit's gonna break authentication, right.\n\n520\n00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:25.710\nThe only thing that you can\nsafely adjust is your time zone.\n\n521\n00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.948\nBecause in the background,\nit's using UTC, right.\n\n522\n00:25:27.948 --> 00:25:29.500\nIt's using Zulu time.\n\n523\n00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.550\nBut everywhere else, you just see\nit rendered in your own time zone.\n\n524\n00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:37.890\nSo if I'm accidentally in the Pacific\nTime Zone, I can move into Eastern.\n\n525\n00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.850\nTechnically my clock is still the same but\n\n526\n00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:44.070\nit's rendering correct,\nversus is I subtract or add 3 hours.\n\n527\n00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.522\nNow I'm breaking it right, so\nthat's kind of the same thing.\n\n528\n00:25:46.522 --> 00:25:49.090\nAnd using NTP is the best way to do that.\n\n529\n00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:53.170\nNow it's grayed out online, because you\nhave to be an administer to change it.\n\n530\n00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:58.792\nAnd I'm logged in with a directory account\nthat is an administrator but, there we go.\n\n531\n00:25:58.792 --> 00:26:01.210\nYep, so now, I can go in and change that.\n\n532\n00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.360\nI can turn that off and\nset my clock manually, if I wanted to.\n\n533\n00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.650\nA lot of users are administrators\non their own machine,\n\n534\n00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.070\nbecause you wanna allow them\nto install their own software.\n\n535\n00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.060\nBut that means they can\nbreak their clock too.\n\n536\n00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:15.070\nSo if you're gonna go that route,\nI recommend using the Profile Manager to\n\n537\n00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:18.590\npush out a hard profile that prevents\nusers from changing the setting.\n\n538\n00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:21.750\nSo you can hard set it, and\nyou don't have to use Apple's time server.\n\n539\n00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.920\nYou can come in and\nspecify one of your own.\n\n540\n00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.790\nSo I know lot of people like pool.ntp.org,\nor\n\n541\n00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.490\nyou might even set up\nyour own time server.\n\n542\n00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:35.400\nBut if you do, make sure that all of your\nmachines are using the same time server,\n\n543\n00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:40.060\ncuz if their clocks get off, you'll start\ngetting authentication issues, right.\n\n544\n00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.580\nIn additional authentication,\nremember your access control list.\n\n545\n00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.430\nThat's another thing that can\ncause you to get blocked, and\n\n546\n00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:48.950\nI showed it the last episode,\nback when I was in the Server Manager.\n\n547\n00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:51.030\nLet me switch back to me.\n\n548\n00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:55.791\nThat when we create user accounts, you\ncan create an ACL on each individual user\n\n549\n00:26:55.791 --> 00:27:00.356\naccount, and that can restrict what\nservices they're allowed to access.\n\n550\n00:27:00.356 --> 00:27:03.278\nSo, if they're trying to access something,\nand they're getting blocked,\n\n551\n00:27:03.278 --> 00:27:04.530\nit could be that they have an ACL.\n\n552\n00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:09.661\nSo if I take an account, like,\nold Dave Mustang, and I hit the gear,\n\n553\n00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:14.096\ndown here, we can go in and\nEdit Access to Service, right?\n\n554\n00:27:14.096 --> 00:27:17.249\nI showed this, where, you can pick and\nchoose what they access.\n\n555\n00:27:17.249 --> 00:27:20.428\nDoesn't matter if their password is right\nor wrong, or if their clock is right or\n\n556\n00:27:20.428 --> 00:27:23.450\nwrong, if it's not checked here,\nthey won't be able to access it.\n\n557\n00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.190\nThat's one thing that can block it.\n\n558\n00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:28.050\nBut those ACLs show up in\nmore than one place right?\n\n559\n00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:33.010\nSo if I have file sharing for example,\nevery shared folder has permissions.\n\n560\n00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:35.620\nBut you'll also see where\nmost of your services,\n\n561\n00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:39.560\neven simple services like the calendar,\nwill have entries in here where you can\n\n562\n00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.360\ncreate ACLs based on what\ncomputers can get to it.\n\n563\n00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.620\nSo now it doesn't matter what user\naccount it is, it's just the,\n\n564\n00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.140\nwhy is it taking a long time to\nload a service that's turned off?\n\n565\n00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:48.980\nThere we go [LAUGH].\n\n566\n00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:53.533\nBut it doesn't matter if it's a user\naccount that has a bad password or\n\n567\n00:27:53.533 --> 00:27:54.392\na bad clock.\n\n568\n00:27:54.392 --> 00:27:54.904\nIf their IP,\n\n569\n00:27:54.904 --> 00:27:58.180\nif their workstation is not allowed to get\nto it then they're gonna have a problem.\n\n570\n00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.730\nSo right here,\nsee the permissions for the calendar?\n\n571\n00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:02.720\nAll users, All Networks?\n\n572\n00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.950\nI can edit those permissions and\nI can specify only some users.\n\n573\n00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:13.690\nAnd now I can pick, and so\nmaybe I want Nick to be able to get to it.\n\n574\n00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:14.976\nWell that worked really well.\n\n575\n00:28:14.976 --> 00:28:19.220\nI want Nick to be able to get to it,\nbut I don't want anybody else, right?\n\n576\n00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.870\nSo I'll just come in here and\nput him in the list.\n\n577\n00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:24.220\nIt's not an ACL on Nick's account.\n\n578\n00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.520\nIt's an ACL on the calendar.\n\n579\n00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.870\nSo access control lists can go either way,\non the user or on the calendar.\n\n580\n00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.520\nAnd once that's done,\nnow he's the only one that can get to it.\n\n581\n00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.340\nWhen connecting from, here's where I\ncan limit it to certain networks, and\n\n582\n00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.930\nso I can say private networks or\nonly some networks.\n\n583\n00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:43.880\nAnd now I can come in and\nget really specific, and\n\n584\n00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.860\nI can create a network like, you know,\nmaybe it's the Gainesville office.\n\n585\n00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:56.850\nAnd I'll say that it's 192.168.0.1\nall the way through 192.168.0.245.\n\n586\n00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:03.022\nAnd specify that, and once that's in\nplace, now if I can click, there we go.\n\n587\n00:29:03.022 --> 00:29:06.163\nNow I have limits on the user and\nthe network, and this is gonna stop people\n\n588\n00:29:06.163 --> 00:29:09.659\nfrom being able to access those services,\neven if their account is completely and\n\n589\n00:29:09.659 --> 00:29:13.030\nperfectly valid, those are other\nthings you wanna troubleshoot.\n\n590\n00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.933\n>> Don, what if somebody makes a mistake,\nthe admin makes a mistake and\n\n591\n00:29:15.933 --> 00:29:18.639\nthey create the user account from\nthe System Preferences rather\n\n592\n00:29:18.639 --> 00:29:19.706\nthan on the service app.\n\n593\n00:29:19.706 --> 00:29:21.735\nWhat's gonna be the end\nresult of their access?\n\n594\n00:29:21.735 --> 00:29:23.310\n>> They're gonna have no network access,\nright?\n\n595\n00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:26.031\nI mean, they might be able to access\nshared folders if those exist,\n\n596\n00:29:26.031 --> 00:29:27.840\ncuz you can authenticate that way.\n\n597\n00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.070\nBut they won't be able to log into\ntheir own machine with that account.\n\n598\n00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:32.393\nNow that might not be a problem, right.\n\n599\n00:29:32.393 --> 00:29:36.286\nIf they're just accessing the calendar and\nchat, they can authenticate each of those\n\n600\n00:29:36.286 --> 00:29:40.235\nindividual applications, and they can put\ntheir account, which would be effectively\n\n601\n00:29:40.235 --> 00:29:44.160\na local account, but they wouldn't be able\nto log into their machine as that account.\n\n602\n00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.723\nSo that means they're gonna have to\nauthenticate in every single app\n\n603\n00:29:46.723 --> 00:29:49.230\nindividually and that's super annoying.\n\n604\n00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:53.250\nIf it's network account, now they can log\ninto their machine with the network and\n\n605\n00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:56.347\nall the apps will automatically\nsee that and get it connected.\n\n606\n00:29:56.347 --> 00:29:59.309\nYou saw with the messages where you can\nmake them message buddies appear in\n\n607\n00:29:59.309 --> 00:30:00.200\nthe same group.\n\n608\n00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.260\nYou start getting features like that\nwhere it all becomes automatic.\n\n609\n00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:05.200\nThat's really what you want,\nyou don't wanna mix and match local and\n\n610\n00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:05.889\nnetwork if you can avoid it.\n\n611\n00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:09.320\nAll right, well,\nI know it's been a little while.\n\n612\n00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.765\nLet's take a look back at that group and\nsee if it ever showed up for us and if\n\n613\n00:30:12.765 --> 00:30:16.891\nnot, we're gonna do a little more digging\non the logs, and we'll see what we've got.\n\n614\n00:30:16.891 --> 00:30:20.647\nSo we'll just jump right over\nhere to groups and there we go,\n\n615\n00:30:20.647 --> 00:30:22.792\nwe've got the band is showing up.\n\n616\n00:30:22.792 --> 00:30:23.948\nThere's that imported group.\n\n617\n00:30:23.948 --> 00:30:26.890\nI guess it just needed a little\ntime to sort itself out there.\n\n618\n00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:30.240\nAnd once I pull that up I can see\nnot only did it make the group,\n\n619\n00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.010\nbut it's got members added to it, right?\n\n620\n00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:34.578\nAll imported from that file.\n\n621\n00:30:34.578 --> 00:30:38.030\nSo if I need to bring in a bunch of\nthese guys all at once, I can do that,\n\n622\n00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:40.964\nget them created and\neven add people to it at the same time.\n\n623\n00:30:40.964 --> 00:30:43.341\nSo just like we saw\nwith the user accounts,\n\n624\n00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:47.322\nnot anything too crazy different there,\nsame basic process, right?\n\n625\n00:30:47.322 --> 00:30:48.890\nJust all about some fine things.\n\n626\n00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:51.760\nYou'll find that a lot of\npeople don't make use of this\n\n627\n00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.750\nquite the same way because, well,\neverybody's got different needs, right,\n\n628\n00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:56.820\ndifferent groups or whatever.\n\n629\n00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.563\nMicrosoft's Active Directory is a little\nmore common out there in the real world\n\n630\n00:30:59.563 --> 00:31:01.676\nfor this stuff and it has\na different way of importing things.\n\n631\n00:31:01.676 --> 00:31:03.580\nSo you'll see a lot of\ndocumentation on that.\n\n632\n00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:07.940\nBut for the Apple exam, obviously,\nthey want you to know the Apple stuff and\n\n633\n00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.100\nthat's basically it.\n\n634\n00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.600\n>> A lot of good information in this one.\n\n635\n00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.822\nAnd remember, this was a two parter.\n\n636\n00:31:11.822 --> 00:31:15.092\nSo if you're catching the second part and\nit sounds a little foreign to you,\n\n637\n00:31:15.092 --> 00:31:17.060\nremember to go back and\nsee the first part.\n\n638\n00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:19.930\nDon, thanks for that information, but\nlooks like we're gonna wrap this up.\n\n639\n00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:21.730\nGot any parting words of wisdom?\n\n640\n00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:25.180\nYou know, one last thing that I\nforgot to mention that might turn up,\n\n641\n00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.280\nis that you can actually nest groups.\n\n642\n00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.820\nSo you can have one group\ninside of another group.\n\n643\n00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.170\nYou may have absolutely no need for this,\nbut let me just give you an example.\n\n644\n00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:36.790\nLet's say that I have sales\npeople in my company.\n\n645\n00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:40.440\nAnd some sales people are in Europe and\nsome sales people are in North America.\n\n646\n00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.920\nI might want salespeople in Europe\nto have access to one printer and\n\n647\n00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.810\nsalespeople in North America to\nhave access to another printer.\n\n648\n00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:49.880\nAnd then I might want all of the\nsalespeople to have access to a certain\n\n649\n00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.100\nshared folder.\n\n650\n00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:54.459\nSo I can create nested\ngroups that meet that need.\n\n651\n00:31:54.459 --> 00:31:56.524\nRight, let me just show you that real\nquick and then we'll wrap it up,\n\n652\n00:31:56.524 --> 00:31:57.750\nI know Wes is giving me the evil eye now.\n\n653\n00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:02.473\nSo I'm gonna create a group\nreal quick called Sales People.\n\n654\n00:32:02.473 --> 00:32:06.773\nSo we'll whip that simple group up and\nget that in place.\n\n655\n00:32:06.773 --> 00:32:13.242\nAnd then I'm gonna create another group\ncalled, maybe like NA Sales People,\n\n656\n00:32:13.242 --> 00:32:17.458\nso this'll be my North American\nsales people, and\n\n657\n00:32:17.458 --> 00:32:22.872\nthen we'll create a EU Sales People for\nthat other side, right.\n\n658\n00:32:22.872 --> 00:32:27.296\nSo now I've got North America, I've got\nEU, I've got everything that I need, and\n\n659\n00:32:27.296 --> 00:32:29.059\nI can go back under Sales People.\n\n660\n00:32:29.059 --> 00:32:32.471\nAnd in the Members,\nwhen we go to add members,\n\n661\n00:32:32.471 --> 00:32:37.293\nyou're normally adding users right,\nbut I can also add Groups.\n\n662\n00:32:37.293 --> 00:32:41.986\nAnd so right there I've added\nNorth America Sales People, and\n\n663\n00:32:41.986 --> 00:32:46.420\nI can add EU Sales People, and\nnow I've got nested groups.\n\n664\n00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.780\nI've got the, oops,\nif I can click OK, there we go.\n\n665\n00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:52.200\nSo if I get permissions to sales people,\n\n666\n00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.260\nevery sales person in the entire\ncompany will get that permission.\n\n667\n00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:59.010\nIf I assign it to EU,\njust people in the EU get permissions.\n\n668\n00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:02.010\nIf I assign it to NA, just people in\nNorth America get the permissions.\n\n669\n00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:05.890\nAnd when I hire a new sales person I\ndon't put them in the Sales People group,\n\n670\n00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:08.370\nI put them in their regional group.\n\n671\n00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:10.834\nAnd their regional group is\na part of the parent group and\n\n672\n00:33:10.834 --> 00:33:13.412\nstill get those permissions\ncuz they kinda trickle down.\n\n673\n00:33:13.412 --> 00:33:17.270\nSo you can nest groups to create\nthe hierarchy that you need.\n\n674\n00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:20.542\nJust remember to make sure they're network\ndirectory accounts and not local directory\n\n675\n00:33:20.542 --> 00:33:23.166\naccounts, so that you can use them\nall throughout your environment.\n\n676\n00:33:23.166 --> 00:33:25.823\n>> Don, thanks for all that great\ninformation, and we do thank you,\n\n677\n00:33:25.823 --> 00:33:27.400\nthe viewers, out there for watching.\n\n678\n00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.760\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign out here at ITProTV.\n\n679\n00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.069\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n680\n00:33:31.069 --> 00:33:32.160\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n681\n00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.258\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n682\n00:33:34.258 -->

00:00:16.336\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\n\n4\n00:00:16.336 --> 00:00:20.851\nin today's episode we're continuing\nalong in our OS X Server essentials.\n\n5\n00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:23.990\nAnd joining me in the studios\ntoday again is Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.490\nDon, how you doing today sir?\n\n7\n00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.310\n>> I'm doing great Wes, ready to dive\nright back into the world of OS X Server.\n\n8\n00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.350\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be taking\na look at one of my favorite products\n\n9\n00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.640\ninside of the whole server suite,\nwhich is the Profile Manager.\n\n10\n00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.805\nThe Profile Manager has saved\nme a ton of time over the years.\n\n11\n00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:43.129\nIt's a really powerful utility and it's\nbaked right inside the $20 server app.\n\n12\n00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.974\nAnd compared to other operating systems,\n\n13\n00:00:44.974 --> 00:00:48.560\nhaving functionality like this is\nreally expensive and really complex.\n\n14\n00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.690\nOn the Apple side, super inexpensive,\nsuper easy to deploy.\n\n15\n00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.860\nSo it's a fun one.\n\n16\n00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.630\nNow, I guess I'm getting ahead of myself\nbecause I haven't even said what the heck\n\n17\n00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.620\nthe Profile Manager is.\n\n18\n00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.454\nWell when you support Macs in a school or\nbusiness in enterprise environment,\n\n19\n00:01:02.454 --> 00:01:07.596\nit’s not that hard to get them set up the\nway you want in the very beginning, right?\n\n20\n00:01:07.596 --> 00:01:09.655\nWe can use things like NetInstal or\n\n21\n00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:14.860\nNetRestore images, we can deploy the Macs\nand set it exactly the way we want.\n\n22\n00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.060\nThe real challenge is keeping them\nset up the way that we want, right.\n\n23\n00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.710\nThat over time people messed with\ntheir computers, they install apps,\n\n24\n00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.430\nthey change the wallpaper,\nthey mess with the power setting.\n\n25\n00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.165\nThey do such all sorts of crazy things,\nand now the computer's configured,\n\n26\n00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:31.400\nlet's just say suboptimally, right?\n\n27\n00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.053\nIt gets all junked up, and\npeople call the help desk and\n\n28\n00:01:34.053 --> 00:01:36.196\nthey complain that their computer is slow.\n\n29\n00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:39.900\nAnd they've messed with all sorts of\nthings, and just caused a lot of problems.\n\n30\n00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.730\nWell, what the Profile Manager does\nis it lets us apply settings and\n\n31\n00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.030\nenforce settings from a central location.\n\n32\n00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.690\nSo for example, let's say I have\n1000 Macs in my environment.\n\n33\n00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.900\nAnd I want them all to\nhave the same wallpaper.\n\n34\n00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.630\nI want to push out this wallpaper image\nto everyone that has the company logo.\n\n35\n00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.360\nWell, I don't want to have to go\nto every one of those 1000 Macs.\n\n36\n00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.400\nI don't want to create\na NetInstall image and\n\n37\n00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.170\nredeploy all 1000 Macs,\nI just wanna change the wallpaper.\n\n38\n00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.025\nWell, you can use the Profile Manager to\nsay, this is the wallpaper I want you to\n\n39\n00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:20.525\nhave, and you can push it out to 1000\nMacs, and they all get set, right?\n\n40\n00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:24.065\nSo, that's one way that it helps us,\nwe can make a change across\n\n41\n00:02:24.065 --> 00:02:27.400\nhundreds of machines all at\nonce from one central location.\n\n42\n00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.262\nAnd then the second thing\nis we can enforce it.\n\n43\n00:02:30.262 --> 00:02:34.185\nWe can say, not just that this\nis the default wallpaper,\n\n44\n00:02:34.185 --> 00:02:36.820\nwe can say this is the only wallpaper.\n\n45\n00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.700\nWe're gonna enforce it so\nyou will have this image.\n\n46\n00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.407\nWe're gonna push that Backstreet Boys\nwallpaper out that Wes always uses, and\n\n47\n00:02:43.407 --> 00:02:46.578\nget that rolled out to all the machines\nand people can't change it.\n\n48\n00:02:46.578 --> 00:02:50.466\n>> Don, you've mentioned that this\nworks for Mac, does it work on\n\n49\n00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:55.640\nyour mobile devices like iOS as well, or\nare we just limited to the Mac devices?\n\n50\n00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.880\n>> So it is part of Apple's MDM solution,\nright, their mobile device management.\n\n51\n00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.780\nAnd when they say MDM we normally\nthink cell phones and tablets,\n\n52\n00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.030\nbut for them it really is\nthe whole Apple ecosystem.\n\n53\n00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.510\nSo the Profile Manager can\nmanage systems running OS X,\n\n54\n00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.910\nwhich is what we focus on on this show.\n\n55\n00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.077\nWe have support for iOS devices,\nincluding iPads and iPhones, and\n\n56\n00:03:17.077 --> 00:03:18.988\nwe have support for Apple TVs.\n\n57\n00:03:18.988 --> 00:03:23.180\nYou can actually manage your Apple TVs\nfrom inside of the Profile Manager.\n\n58\n00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.770\nNot a lot of need to do that but\nyou certainly can.\n\n59\n00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.426\nIf you're a school or a business and\nyou're deploying these devices,\n\n60\n00:03:29.426 --> 00:03:31.208\nit's nice to have it all\nrolled into one place.\n\n61\n00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:34.825\nNow, I will say that there are some\nsettings that are common across\n\n62\n00:03:34.825 --> 00:03:35.988\nall the devices, and\n\n63\n00:03:35.988 --> 00:03:39.900\nthen there's other settings that\nare very unique to each device.\n\n64\n00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.590\nSo, for example, cellular provider\nsettings, you'll have those on an iPhone.\n\n65\n00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.640\nYou won't have those on a MacBook Pro.\n\n66\n00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.690\nAnd so the settings get divided up based\non the type of devices they apply to.\n\n67\n00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.298\nSo we'll see that as we start to work with\nthe Profile Manager, that there's some\n\n68\n00:03:55.298 --> 00:03:58.460\nthings that we can do to every single\ndevice in our entire environment.\n\n69\n00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.340\nLaptop, desktop, iPhone, tablet, Apple TV,\nwhatever, we can do it to all of them.\n\n70\n00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.100\nAnd there's other settings that\nwill only apply to certain subsets.\n\n71\n00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.000\nRight, now the other thing to remember\nbefore we dive into the Profile Manager,\n\n72\n00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.840\nis it's not the only game in town.\n\n73\n00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.870\nThere are other tools, other systems that\nApple has, that let you do the same thing.\n\n74\n00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.420\nSo for example, the Apple Remote Desktop.\n\n75\n00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.990\nApple Remote Desktop will let\nyou deploy software to machines.\n\n76\n00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.000\nIt'll let you change\nthe wallpaper of a machine.\n\n77\n00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.660\nBut what Apple Remote Desktop doesn't do,\nis enforce it.\n\n78\n00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.420\nIt doesnt force it to stay that way.\n\n79\n00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.752\nI can't force the wallpaper.\n\n80\n00:04:34.752 --> 00:04:37.353\nI can set it and then a user could\ncome and change it again, and\n\n81\n00:04:37.353 --> 00:04:39.860\nI would just have to come and\nset it again, right.\n\n82\n00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.250\nApple Remote Desktop is really\ndesigned for reaching out and\n\n83\n00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.070\ndoing one time touches and\njust routine management.\n\n84\n00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.450\nProfile Manager is really useful for\ncreating what's effectively a policy.\n\n85\n00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.650\nThis is the policy for how I want my\ncomputer to be used, and enforcing it.\n\n86\n00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.030\nSo that's really cool.\n\n87\n00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.120\nAnd then there's third party MDMs that are\nout there, Apple supports a number of them\n\n88\n00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.970\nwhere they provide a completely\nseparate infrastructure.\n\n89\n00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.630\nIt actually leverages the same\nstuff as the Profile Manager, and\n\n90\n00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.400\nenforces the changes across the machine.\n\n91\n00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.506\nSo, you may not use\nthe Profile Manager at all,\n\n92\n00:05:08.506 --> 00:05:11.685\nyou may use those third party solutions,\nand that's perfectly fine.\n\n93\n00:05:11.685 --> 00:05:16.516\nBut, for $20, now I'm gonna\nsound like a commercial here.\n\n94\n00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:21.210\nFor only $20,\nyou can have an OS X server running\n\n95\n00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.520\nthe Profile Manager that pushes out these\nsettings to tens of thousands of machines.\n\n96\n00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.200\nIt's all right here and\nit's pretty easy to deploy.\n\n97\n00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.650\nAll right, so let's talk a little\nbit about how this things works.\n\n98\n00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.630\nNow we're gonna turn on\nthe Profile Manager and\n\n99\n00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.200\nit's not really the most\nexciting thing in the world.\n\n100\n00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.930\nLet me show you here.\n\n101\n00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.470\nSo on my server that I've got fired\nup here, if I go into my server app,\n\n102\n00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.800\non the left side, I can come down and\nI can find Profile Manager.\n\n103\n00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.910\nAnd in the Profile Manager,\n\n104\n00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.640\nyou'll see there's a handful of settings\nthat are spread throughout here.\n\n105\n00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.120\nHonestly, I don't have to\nmess with many of them.\n\n106\n00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.870\nI can just hit the on button,\nand now I'm a Profile Manager.\n\n107\n00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.140\nOkay, what it's gonna do,\nis it's gonna set up a web server.\n\n108\n00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.311\nA special web server\nthat's running just for\n\n109\n00:06:03.311 --> 00:06:05.606\nthe Profile Manager right\nhere on this system.\n\n110\n00:06:05.606 --> 00:06:10.832\nAnd then the other devices on my network,\nthe MacBooks or Mac Pros, the iPads,\n\n111\n00:06:10.832 --> 00:06:15.512\niOS devices, whatever, they can all\njust browse to this webpage, and\n\n112\n00:06:15.512 --> 00:06:18.550\nget their management information from it.\n\n113\n00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.030\nNow, we have to tell them to do that.\n\n114\n00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.020\nThey don't do it automatically.\n\n115\n00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.980\nYou don't just randomly start searching\nthe network for someone to manage you.\n\n116\n00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.690\nWe've got to tell them to do it, right?\n\n117\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.070\nBut it's effectively doing\nit through a web server.\n\n118\n00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.150\nAnd the web server is\nserving up XML files.\n\n119\n00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.290\nXML is the extensible markup language.\n\n120\n00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.850\nSo they're just little text files.\n\n121\n00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.550\nAnd they're made up of tons\nof configuration settings.\n\n122\n00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.470\nAnd we can choose to encrypt those or\nleave them unencrypted, that's up to us.\n\n123\n00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.760\nBut those XML files have\nall those settings.\n\n124\n00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.620\nSo when your laptop or your desktop or\nwhatever fires up on the network,\n\n125\n00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.090\nit can browse to\nthe Profile Manager's web server,\n\n126\n00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:57.410\nrequest a copy of that XML file,\ndownload it, and apply all those settings.\n\n127\n00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.200\nAnd if it's an offline machine, right,\n\n128\n00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.380\nmaybe it's in a remote location that\ndoesn't have Internet connectivity,\n\n129\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.600\nI can take that configuration file and\nI can store it on a USB key.\n\n130\n00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.230\nAnd whenever I bring up a new\ncomputer out of that remote location,\n\n131\n00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.120\nI get to plug in the USB key and\ndouble click on that file, and\n\n132\n00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.730\nit'll install the profile on that machine,\nand now it's got all the settings.\n\n133\n00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.480\nI can't remote manage it cuz I don't\nhave a network connection, but\n\n134\n00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.330\nI can at least put the initial\nconfiguration on there, all right.\n\n135\n00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.040\nAnd there's a few reasons where you might\nwanna do that even if we do have a network\n\n136\n00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.090\nconnection, but\nwe'll talk about that a little bit later.\n\n137\n00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.270\nBut really it's just a web\nserver handing off XML files.\n\n138\n00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.240\nBut this piece right here\nis just one piece of it.\n\n139\n00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.220\nThis is the web server, right?\n\n140\n00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.940\nThen we have to go into the web server and\nstart to create our configuration.\n\n141\n00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.890\nSo the Profile Manager has limited\nfunctionality here in the server app.\n\n142\n00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:48.255\nThe majority of the work we do is actually\ngonna be done through that web server, but\n\n143\n00:07:48.255 --> 00:07:49.471\nthis is where we get started.\n\n144\n00:07:49.471 --> 00:07:53.430\nAnd in here what you're configuring\nare really three things, all right?\n\n145\n00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.733\nYou're configuring the web server for\n\n146\n00:07:55.733 --> 00:08:00.419\nmanagement that we're gonna use You\nconfigure the web server for the end user.\n\n147\n00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:04.120\nSo they use for device enrollment,\nfor attaching devices.\n\n148\n00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.088\nAnd you configure MDM,\nDevice Management right here.\n\n149\n00:08:08.088 --> 00:08:11.390\nAll right now, the Profile Manager\ndoes Device Management, right, so\n\n150\n00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.790\nwhy do I need specific settings for this?\n\n151\n00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.890\nWell, here's the thing.\n\n152\n00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.020\nWhen it comes to\nthe Device Management side of things,\n\n153\n00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.730\nif the device is right here on the network\nwith my server, then I can enroll it,\n\n154\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.840\nit's gonna connect, and\neverything is gonna be great.\n\n155\n00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.990\nBut what happens if I've\n\n156\n00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:33.350\ngot a device at a remote location, and I\nmight have network connectivity in place,\n\n157\n00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:38.192\nbut the device is at a remote location and\nit can't necessarily find my server.\n\n158\n00:08:38.192 --> 00:08:40.500\nMaybe if somebody gets a new laptop and\nthey take it home.\n\n159\n00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.082\nCan they connect to my server from home?\n\n160\n00:08:42.082 --> 00:08:46.370\nNot normally, maybe we set up a VPN and\nthey can connect from home or\n\n161\n00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:47.690\nwhatever, right?\n\n162\n00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.280\nBut if we turn on Device Management,\nwhat's gonna happen is it's gonna connect\n\n163\n00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:56.160\nonto Apple, and it's gonna get a push\nnotification certificate from Apple.\n\n164\n00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.605\nAnd what it's gonna do,\nis it's gonna let our server,\n\n165\n00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:02.991\nour Profile Manager server,\nsend messages to Apple.\n\n166\n00:09:02.991 --> 00:09:05.748\nAnd those laptops and\ndesktops that are out there in the field,\n\n167\n00:09:05.748 --> 00:09:09.300\non completely separate networks, they\ntalk to Apple too for software updates.\n\n168\n00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:14.190\nAnd when they talk to Apple, they can say,\ndo you have any notifications for me?\n\n169\n00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.270\nOr Apple's gonna push them over too and\n\n170\n00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.480\nso Apple's gonna send\nthem to the workstations.\n\n171\n00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.964\nAnd so they'll get notifications and\n\n172\n00:09:19.964 --> 00:09:22.742\nthey'll be managed even though\nthey're not on the same network as me,\n\n173\n00:09:22.742 --> 00:09:24.987\neven though they're on a network\nI have no control over.\n\n174\n00:09:24.987 --> 00:09:28.357\nThey could be at a hotel network and\nthanks to leapfrogging through Apple\n\n175\n00:09:28.357 --> 00:09:31.078\nservers, we'll still be able\nto send updates out there.\n\n176\n00:09:31.078 --> 00:09:32.470\n>> Don, is it fair to say that,\n\n177\n00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:36.374\nyou mentioned that if they're in your\nLAN environment, you can control them.\n\n178\n00:09:36.374 --> 00:09:40.094\nBut if they're on a WAN connection or\ngoing over a WAN connection that Apple is\n\n179\n00:09:40.094 --> 00:09:43.989\nkinda like the escrow, kinda like the\nmiddle man between your LAN communication\n\n180\n00:09:43.989 --> 00:09:47.555\nand those devices that you need to reach\nout over a WAN link and configure.\n\n181\n00:09:47.555 --> 00:09:50.270\n>> Yeah, it's a pretty good description.\n\n182\n00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:56.200\nIt's not quite truly an escrow cuz they're\nnot running an MDM for you, right?\n\n183\n00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.220\nBut they're just relaying\nyour communication so\n\n184\n00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.140\nthey're more like a proxy or something.\n\n185\n00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.940\nAnd so we send the message to Apple,\nApple just relays the message over\n\n186\n00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.820\nto the client so they get it,\nand they stay up to date.\n\n187\n00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.190\nSo Apple's getting involved in that.\n\n188\n00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.620\nAnd in order to do that, we need\na secure connection through Apple and\n\n189\n00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.470\nwe need a certificate.\n\n190\n00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.080\nSo that's what we're kind\nof enrolling right there.\n\n191\n00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.080\nSo when we go to turn all this on,\nwe're gonna see that happen with Apple.\n\n192\n00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.450\nI'm gonna need to provide an Apple ID so\n\n193\n00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.890\nthat I can get a valid\ncertificate from Apple.\n\n194\n00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.320\nAnd that certificate will be good for\none year.\n\n195\n00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.590\nAnd then every year I need to renew it,\nit'll give you warnings.\n\n196\n00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.640\nAnd renewing, it's hard,\nyou click the Renew button and it renews.\n\n197\n00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.600\nSo it's really not a big deal to renew it.\n\n198\n00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.840\nBut it is only good for a year, and\nyou just keep getting a new cert.\n\n199\n00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.140\nI keep configuring the Profile Manager for\nvarious shows that I do, and\n\n200\n00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.730\nI never renew those certificates\ncuz I just use them in a show.\n\n201\n00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.900\nAnd I tell you, I have at least three or\nfour of those certs expire every single\n\n202\n00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.290\nmonth it seems, so\nyou kinda get used to it.\n\n203\n00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.850\nBut for the ones that you use\nin your enterprise environment,\n\n204\n00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:55.725\nyou absolutely want to renew them so\nyou can continue to manage your devices.\n\n205\n00:10:55.725 --> 00:10:58.650\nAll right, now let's talk\na little about those devices.\n\n206\n00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.900\nI mentioned the certificate from Apple,\n\n207\n00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:05.360\nwe also need certificates on\nour own Profile Manager, right?\n\n208\n00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.140\nWhen your client goes to\nconnect to the Profile Manager,\n\n209\n00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.170\nit needs to know that it can\ntrust the Profile Manager.\n\n210\n00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.010\nImagine if somebody malicious\ngot on your network and\n\n211\n00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.880\nbrought up their own Profile Manager,\nright?\n\n212\n00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.210\nThey could start pushing whatever settings\nthey wanted out to your workstations,\n\n213\n00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.290\nthat would be bad.\n\n214\n00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.510\nAnd so by default,\nthey're not allowed to do that.\n\n215\n00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.030\nSo your clients have to\ntrust the Profile Manager.\n\n216\n00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.200\nAnd that's gonna be one of the first\nsteps of enrolling a device.\n\n217\n00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.540\nWe have what's called device enrollment.\n\n218\n00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.240\nWhere you take a laptop or a desktop and\nyou join it to your Profile Manager so\n\n219\n00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.720\nthat they'll be able to communicate and\nbe managed, right.\n\n220\n00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.640\nWell, you have to have\ncertificates to do that.\n\n221\n00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.390\nAnd really,\nthere's two ways to go about it.\n\n222\n00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.920\nThe method one is to use the self-signed\n\n223\n00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.100\ncertificate that's a part\nof the OS X server app.\n\n224\n00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.290\nWe talked about certificates\nin another episode.\n\n225\n00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:54.010\nBut every server app has at least one,\nI'm gonna call it a fake certificate.\n\n226\n00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.610\nIt's a certificate that is real enough,\nbut you made it up.\n\n227\n00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.470\nYou made it up just on your own system and\nnobody else is gonna trust that.\n\n228\n00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:06.530\nSo we might have to take that certificate\nand copy it and take it over to that\n\n229\n00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.580\nclient and load it on the client so that\nthe client will trust us, that's one way.\n\n230\n00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.177\nOr you just get a little dialogue and\nyou can say OK on the window,\n\n231\n00:12:12.177 --> 00:12:14.160\nwe'll see it in the show, right.\n\n232\n00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.260\nOr the other option is to set up\na true public key infrastructure, PKI.\n\n233\n00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.824\nSet up your own certificate authority so\n\n234\n00:12:19.824 --> 00:12:22.585\nyou can issue trusted certificates\nto all of your clients, all right.\n\n235\n00:12:22.585 --> 00:12:24.625\nIf you wanna go that route, jump back and\n\n236\n00:12:24.625 --> 00:12:28.720\nwatch our certificate episode because we\nkind of showed how that process works.\n\n237\n00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.220\nBut the easiest way to do it\nis with an Open Directory.\n\n238\n00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.730\nIf you're running the Apple Open\nDirectory, you can set up your server,\n\n239\n00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:40.730\nyour server will automatically become a CA\nas part of the Open Directory wizard.\n\n240\n00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:44.100\nSo when you complete that Open Directory\nwizard, you'll become a CA.\n\n241\n00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.910\nAnd then any client that you\nbind to your Open Directory\n\n242\n00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.540\nwill automatically trust\nyour certificates.\n\n243\n00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.590\nAnd that's solves the certificate\nproblem right there.\n\n244\n00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:56.040\nSo if you need a PKI and you just don't\nwanna mess around with figuring all that\n\n245\n00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.140\nout, the easiest solution is to\nwhip up an Apple Open Directory.\n\n246\n00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.487\nIt's a part of the server app\njust like the Profile Manager so\n\n247\n00:13:01.487 --> 00:13:03.470\nit's easy enough to whip that one out.\n\n248\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.300\nOn the show I'm gonna do it without\nan Open Directory, all right?\n\n249\n00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.060\nBecause I wanna show you guys\nthe certificate errors that pop up, and\n\n250\n00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.270\nso we'll be able to\nidentify that as we go.\n\n251\n00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.940\nIf I had an Open Directory in place,\nI just wouldn't see those errors,\n\n252\n00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.150\nit would just move right through.\n\n253\n00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.669\nSo we can kinda see two\nthings at the same time here.\n\n254\n00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.760\nAll right, so\nif I wanna get this turned on,\n\n255\n00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.780\nlet's talk about getting\nthe Profile Manager turned on.\n\n256\n00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.530\nI could just flip that On switch, but\n\n257\n00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.360\nI do need to kinda tweak\na few little things, right?\n\n258\n00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.260\nAnd looking at the settings,\n\n259\n00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.910\nthe first one I've got here is\njust my general permissions.\n\n260\n00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.730\nBy default,\nall networks are allowed to connect and\n\n261\n00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.980\nthat's probably what I want, right?\n\n262\n00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.780\nEven if a client is on a different\nnetwork somewhere else on the planet,\n\n263\n00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.310\nI still want them to be able to\nconnect and get managed by my system.\n\n264\n00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.180\nSo we don't normally mess with that.\n\n265\n00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.760\nOn some of our other stuff,\nlike our web server,\n\n266\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.300\nour mail server, we might want to\nthrottle those and limit who can connect.\n\n267\n00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.170\nBut on Profile Manager,\nyou don't normally want to do that.\n\n268\n00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.680\nBut if you only want to manage people\nwhile they're in the building,\n\n269\n00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.095\nthen you could throttle this down\nto just your local networks.\n\n270\n00:13:59.095 --> 00:14:02.385\nIt's the same settings as\nwe've seen in other areas.\n\n271\n00:14:02.385 --> 00:14:06.105\nSo we can say private networks,\nwhich are just our internal IPs, and\n\n272\n00:14:06.105 --> 00:14:10.205\nthen only some networks where we specify\nthe IP ranges that we want to allow.\n\n273\n00:14:10.205 --> 00:14:12.335\nSo you've got a few options there, right.\n\n274\n00:14:12.335 --> 00:14:15.552\nI'm gonna leave it at All Networks,\nthat's typically what we want.\n\n275\n00:14:15.552 --> 00:14:19.075\nThen we've got Device Management, and\nthis I need to turn on, all right.\n\n276\n00:14:19.075 --> 00:14:21.125\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit Configure and\n\n277\n00:14:21.125 --> 00:14:23.360\nwhat it's gonna do is it's\ngonna look at my settings.\n\n278\n00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.070\nAnd it's telling me that I need\nto have an Internet connection.\n\n279\n00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.744\nAnd if I do,\nthat I'll be able to remotely lock or\n\n280\n00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:32.369\nwipe my machines if I set\nup Device Management.\n\n281\n00:14:32.369 --> 00:14:34.360\nRight, that's one of\nthe things that we want.\n\n282\n00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.400\nIf somebody loses their phone,\nI want to be able to remote wipe it or\n\n283\n00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.050\nremote lock it.\n\n284\n00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.180\nI want to be able to\nmanage that from here.\n\n285\n00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.620\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ncontinue on this.\n\n286\n00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.690\nAnd it's gonna tell me that, well,\n\n287\n00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.590\nI need to configure my server\nas a network directory.\n\n288\n00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.170\nWhat's that all about?\n\n289\n00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.100\nWell that's the Open Directory, right?\n\n290\n00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.780\nIt needs to be an Open Directory so\n\n291\n00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:59.090\nthat it can have proper authentication\ncredentials between the client and me.\n\n292\n00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.523\nSo it's offering to set\nup Open Directory for me.\n\n293\n00:15:01.523 --> 00:15:06.180\nIf I don't want to do that, if I don't\nwant to do this, I can cancel this\n\n294\n00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:10.240\nMDM part and I could create profiles and\nsave them to a USB key.\n\n295\n00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.700\nAnd then I could take the USB\nkey over to the machines and\n\n296\n00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:13.960\ninstall it that way manually.\n\n297\n00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.560\nSo you can do it manually and\nnot have an Open Directory.\n\n298\n00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.630\nBut if I want this stuff to be automatic,\nI'm gonna need it.\n\n299\n00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:22.450\nNow, even though it's gonna\ncreate the Open Directory here,\n\n300\n00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:25.260\nI don't actually have to bind\nmy clients to the Open Directly.\n\n301\n00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.230\nWe'll see that we can still\nwork around that too.\n\n302\n00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.550\nSo you don't have to go all in with the\nOpen Directory if you don't want to, but\n\n303\n00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.370\nto have the full functionality\nwe're going to need it.\n\n304\n00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:35.960\nAnd I mentioned earlier, with the\ncertificates that we kinda want it anyway\n\n305\n00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.270\njust to make the certificates get trusted.\n\n306\n00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.820\nAll right, so it's gonna go ahead and\ncreate an Open Directory for\n\n307\n00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:45.620\nme and I'm just gonna punch in\nthe default credentials and\n\n308\n00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.190\nwe'll just hit Next on that.\n\n309\n00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:48.910\nI'll give it an organization name.\n\n310\n00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.162\nIf you haven't worked with\nthe Open Directory, jump back and\n\n311\n00:15:51.162 --> 00:15:53.689\ncheck out our Open Directory episode,\nwe covered it in depth there.\n\n312\n00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:58.560\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nprovide a little bit of data here and\n\n313\n00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.850\nwe'll say that I'll be Be the admin today.\n\n314\n00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:03.290\nShould make you the admin, Wes.\n\n315\n00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.135\nEverybody can complain to you\nwhen something doesn't work.\n\n316\n00:16:05.135 --> 00:16:06.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we'll set that out.\n\n317\n00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:08.890\nOpen Directory really easy to get set up,\nright?\n\n318\n00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:12.050\nJust an organization name,\nan admin and an email address and\n\n319\n00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.080\nyou're pretty much in business.\n\n320\n00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.980\nSo you don't have to be a Open Directory\ngenius to get this one turned on.\n\n321\n00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.563\n>> With the configuration profile down in\nmobile device management you've showed us\n\n322\n00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:24.574\nin some of the other episodes\nthat a lot of this services\n\n323\n00:16:24.574 --> 00:16:27.269\nin the background require\nlocation of a device.\n\n324\n00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:31.820\nLike for instance, through a name, an IP\naddress, and it always boils down to DNS.\n\n325\n00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.720\nWhere does DNS sit in\nthe configuration for Profile Manager?\n\n326\n00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.750\n>> So if I'm just using Open Directory\nright here in the server,\n\n327\n00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.870\nI really don't have to worry\nabout DNS at all, right?\n\n328\n00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.340\nCuz the server will find itself using\nBonjour, and that's the end of it.\n\n329\n00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.850\nAnd if I've got clients that\nare gonna bind Open Directory and\n\n330\n00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:48.770\nthey're on the same network as me,\n\n331\n00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:51.340\nthen again I really don't have\nto worry about DNS there either.\n\n332\n00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:55.860\nBut if I've got clients on more than one\nIP subnet, and I expect them to find this\n\n333\n00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.310\nOpen Directory server,\nI'm gonna need to configure DNS for that.\n\n334\n00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:59.670\nI'll need to have that in place.\n\n335\n00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.690\nNow I haven't bound my\nclients the Open Directory so\n\n336\n00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:03.990\nit doesn't really matter there.\n\n337\n00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:07.530\nBut if I did then I would need\nto go ahead and setup DNS,\n\n338\n00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.350\nand so\nwe covered that in the DNS episode but\n\n339\n00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:13.220\nalso in the Open Directory episode\nto make sure that was setup.\n\n340\n00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.290\nIn my case, DNS isn't gonna help much,\nand let me show you why,\n\n341\n00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:17.330\nas soon as this finishes.\n\n342\n00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.052\nWell shoot,\nnow it's continuing with Open Directory.\n\n343\n00:17:21.052 --> 00:17:24.925\nBut when I clear this wizard,\nwhen we through with it, and\n\n344\n00:17:24.925 --> 00:17:29.589\nI go back on the main screen,\nyou'll see that my server's host name is\n\n345\n00:17:29.589 --> 00:17:34.751\nOHX-Server01.local, .local's not\na valid DNS domain name, right?\n\n346\n00:17:34.751 --> 00:17:36.750\nSo that's not gonna work\nout there on the Internet,\n\n347\n00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.560\npeople aren't gonna be able to find me.\n\n348\n00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.790\nSo I've kinda set myself up for, I don't\nwanna say failure, but I set myself up for\n\n349\n00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:46.620\nlocal name resolution only, which\nBonjour's normally gonna take care of.\n\n350\n00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.600\nSo I shouldn't have to\nsweat DNS much here.\n\n351\n00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.430\nBut if I want the best kind of\nconnectivity possible, if I want the most\n\n352\n00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:57.700\nstable and worldwide reaching network,\nI'll use a real domain name,\n\n353\n00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.539\nI'll configure my DNS lookup zone so that\nthe clients are able to find my server.\n\n354\n00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.900\nAll right, so now it's just asking you\nabout a little bit of information here on\n\n355\n00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:06.730\nthe organization.\n\n356\n00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:10.120\nAnd this is for the profile manager so\nthat it'll be able to identify things.\n\n357\n00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:14.190\nIt needs an email address, the name of\nthe company, phone number, and so on.\n\n358\n00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:15.730\nSo we can punch that in.\n\n359\n00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:20.560\nI can give it the office number, if I can\nremember what our office number is, and\n\n360\n00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.320\nour address.\n\n361\n00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.820\nSo we'll just punch these in now.\n\n362\n00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:27.310\nThis is information that Apple\ndoesn't really care about.\n\n363\n00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:32.270\nThis is for your end users, that if we\nremote lock a phone or something like that\n\n364\n00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:37.300\nthat it'll display this information in the\nabout boxes and the other descriptions.\n\n365\n00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:41.910\nSo that people can identify who\nit is that has that equipment or\n\n366\n00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.040\nowns the equipment or whatever.\n\n367\n00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.150\nSo it is useful to have that punched in.\n\n368\n00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.930\nBut you can put fake data in here and\nApple's not really gonna care.\n\n369\n00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.753\n>> I was gonna say now I know\nwhy you put my email address and\n\n370\n00:18:50.753 --> 00:18:52.116\nmy phone number in there.\n\n371\n00:18:52.116 --> 00:18:53.198\nThanks I appreciate it man.\n\n372\n00:18:53.198 --> 00:18:55.360\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n373\n00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.960\nOkay so now once it's done it's gonna\nflag me for my certificate, right.\n\n374\n00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.580\nSo it's telling me here the web server\nisn't configured to use a trusted\n\n375\n00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.150\nssl certificate.\n\n376\n00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:10.250\nIt is configured user certificate,\njust not a trusted one and if you look,\n\n377\n00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:13.530\nif I were to go dig into the web server\nit said to use a self signed certificate,\n\n378\n00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.600\none we created ourselves.\n\n379\n00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.050\nIf we got an actual valid certificate,\nif we went out and bought a certificate to\n\n380\n00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:24.970\nuse on this server,\nthen from that point we have a cert\n\n381\n00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:29.270\nthat would already trusted by everybody\nand this cert will work out great.\n\n382\n00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.840\nBut if you create your own,\nthat's not a big deal.\n\n383\n00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.630\nYou can create your own,\n\n384\n00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.300\nyou just have to remember that your\nclients aren't going to trust it.\n\n385\n00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.060\nSo I'll show you how to get those\nclients to trust it when we join\n\n386\n00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.030\nour first client, right?\n\n387\n00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.939\nSo I'm gonna leave that be and\nI'll just hit Next.\n\n388\n00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.930\nAnd now it's asking for\nan Apple ID, all right?\n\n389\n00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:49.850\nI've got to have an Apple ID because I'm\nreaching out to Apple to create that\n\n390\n00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.640\npush notification certificate.\n\n391\n00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.790\nSo when it does that it's got to be\ntied to somebody's account, all right?\n\n392\n00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.310\nAnd so you need to put this one in here.\n\n393\n00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:04.380\nNow I'm using my own, it you work for a\ncompany, and it's tied to one employee and\n\n394\n00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:08.465\nthat employee leaves, gets terminated,\nthey got a job somewhere else.\n\n395\n00:20:08.465 --> 00:20:10.698\nWell, how are you gonna renew that\ncertificate if you don't have\n\n396\n00:20:10.698 --> 00:20:11.274\ntheir account?\n\n397\n00:20:11.274 --> 00:20:12.020\nYou can't.\n\n398\n00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:16.190\nSo you'll want to create\nan Apple ID specifically for\n\n399\n00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.090\nmanaging this, for\nmanaging your profile manager.\n\n400\n00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:23.036\nSo that it can be an Apple ID that's\ntied to no individual person, but\n\n401\n00:20:23.036 --> 00:20:26.575\ntied to a distribution group or\nsomething that I normally do or\n\n402\n00:20:26.575 --> 00:20:29.705\ntie it to an admin at ITPRO.TV or\nsomething like that,\n\n403\n00:20:29.705 --> 00:20:32.720\nthat can be tied to more than one person,\nall right?\n\n404\n00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.750\nSo that's gonna reach out to Apple.\n\n405\n00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.358\nNow, when it reaches out to Apple,\n\n406\n00:20:36.358 --> 00:20:39.103\nI do wanna give you a warning\ncuz it's not gonna happen to me.\n\n407\n00:20:39.103 --> 00:20:42.967\nBut, if you hit Next and it tries and\ngives you an error and it says,\n\n408\n00:20:42.967 --> 00:20:46.831\nunable to issue you a certificate or\nunable to contact the server,\n\n409\n00:20:46.831 --> 00:20:49.390\nthere's two main errors that you see here.\n\n410\n00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:50.510\nOne you could have a wrong password.\n\n411\n00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.080\nIt'll tell you if the password is wrong.\n\n412\n00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.800\nOr two it'll say unable\nto connect to the server.\n\n413\n00:20:53.800 --> 00:21:00.360\nAll right, well unable to connect to the\nserver, it's not actually a network issue.\n\n414\n00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:05.740\nIn order to issue that certificate\nyour Apple ID has to be validated.\n\n415\n00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.810\nAnd normally to validate an Apple ID,\n\n416\n00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.610\nthe way you validate it,\nis to put a credit card on it.\n\n417\n00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.610\nIf you have a credit card attached\nto your Apple ID, then you'll see,\n\n418\n00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:18.915\njust like mine did right there, it'll move\nforward no problem at all, all right.\n\n419\n00:21:18.915 --> 00:21:22.875\nIf you don't have a credit card, if I\njust create an Apple ID specifically for\n\n420\n00:21:22.875 --> 00:21:25.685\nprofile manager,\nlike I just said to do two minutes ago,\n\n421\n00:21:25.685 --> 00:21:30.650\nif I did that I'm not gonna have a credit\non it and it's gonna fail, all right.\n\n422\n00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:31.610\nBut it won't tell you that,\n\n423\n00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:34.177\nit'll say unable to connect to server,\nit's really misleading, right?\n\n424\n00:21:34.177 --> 00:21:37.680\nSo what you need to do is make\nsure your Apple ID is verified.\n\n425\n00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.360\nAnd they have other ways they can verify.\n\n426\n00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.610\nYou can log in and tell it to\nverify by sending you an email, and\n\n427\n00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.280\nyou validate that you actually\nown that email address, right.\n\n428\n00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.310\nIt'll email you a code, you punch\nin the code, and you're validated.\n\n429\n00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.050\nIt's just the error message\ndoesn't tell you that, all right.\n\n430\n00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:51.480\nI've bumped into this a number of times,\n\n431\n00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.230\nit's not well documented\non Apple's website.\n\n432\n00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:59.360\nAnd you can create an Apple ID and\nverify it without a credit card.\n\n433\n00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.146\nThere's actually a knowledge based article\non Apple's website on how to do that,\n\n434\n00:22:03.146 --> 00:22:05.753\nI had one of our viewers in\na previous show send it in to me.\n\n435\n00:22:05.753 --> 00:22:07.073\nSo I'll put that in the show notes so\n\n436\n00:22:07.073 --> 00:22:09.940\nyou guys have it if you need to create\nan Apple ID without a credit card.\n\n437\n00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.410\nBut that's what it will take to make\nsure that error doesn't come up.\n\n438\n00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:17.175\n>> Don, I noticed in some of the fine\nprint scrolling by in that wizard there,\n\n439\n00:22:17.175 --> 00:22:20.593\nwhen you put in your Apple ID and\nyou clicked connect.\n\n440\n00:22:20.593 --> 00:22:22.724\nWhen it issues the APN certificate,\n\n441\n00:22:22.724 --> 00:22:26.847\nis that being stored up at Apple's\nwebsite and you have to download it,\n\n442\n00:22:26.847 --> 00:22:30.097\nor is it being pushed directly\nto your profile manager?\n\n443\n00:22:30.097 --> 00:22:30.723\nAs far as the-\n>> Both.\n\n444\n00:22:30.723 --> 00:22:31.660\n>> Both?\n\n445\n00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:36.169\n>> What's really happening is there's\na private key that your machine kind of\n\n446\n00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:40.817\ngenerates and sends up to Apple and Apple\nis signing it and signing it with their\n\n447\n00:22:40.817 --> 00:22:45.480\nidentity because it's actually kind of\ntied to their certificates up there.\n\n448\n00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.110\nThey have a wild card cert that's\nbasically being attached to this.\n\n449\n00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:51.720\nAnd then they're pushing back\ndown a signed public ETU.\n\n450\n00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.410\nAnd so Apple has the public\nkey stored on their side and\n\n451\n00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.290\nthen you have the private and\npublic key stored on your side.\n\n452\n00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:02.140\nSo Apple doesn't have all the data, and\nthat's important because Apple wants you\n\n453\n00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.663\nto know, hey, we can't, well,\nI'm sure that they can do a lot of things.\n\n454\n00:23:05.663 --> 00:23:06.811\nBut they say, we can't reach in and\n\n455\n00:23:06.811 --> 00:23:09.678\nmess with your profile manager because\nwe don't have your private key.\n\n456\n00:23:09.678 --> 00:23:12.520\nWe just signed the public key,\nbut they do have part of it and\n\n457\n00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.840\nit is stored up there at Apple,\nthey've got it.\n\n458\n00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.810\n>> Are there any security concerns?\n\n459\n00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:19.174\nWhen we talk about private\nkeys a lot of times we talk,\n\n460\n00:23:19.174 --> 00:23:21.870\nhey you don't want those going\nover the wire or the network.\n\n461\n00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:23.636\nWe say sneakernet those if you can.\n\n462\n00:23:23.636 --> 00:23:26.768\nAre there encryption or\nis there any privacy concerns or\n\n463\n00:23:26.768 --> 00:23:29.455\nsecurity concerns is I\nguess what I'm asking.\n\n464\n00:23:29.455 --> 00:23:32.015\n>> In this scenario,\nthe private key never left my machine.\n\n465\n00:23:32.015 --> 00:23:33.275\nThe private key stayed right here.\n\n466\n00:23:33.275 --> 00:23:34.325\nI made it myself.\n\n467\n00:23:34.325 --> 00:23:34.835\nRight, we saw it.\n\n468\n00:23:34.835 --> 00:23:36.446\nI picked it earlier in the wizard, right?\n\n469\n00:23:36.446 --> 00:23:37.865\nSo that's my private key.\n\n470\n00:23:37.865 --> 00:23:41.005\nAnd I made a public key, and\nset that up at Apple to be signed.\n\n471\n00:23:41.005 --> 00:23:43.675\nSo if somebody stole that public key,\nthat's no big deal.\n\n472\n00:23:43.675 --> 00:23:45.885\nWe give the public key out to\nanyone that wants to see it.\n\n473\n00:23:45.885 --> 00:23:47.440\nThat's no big deal at all.\n\n474\n00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.870\nThat allows somebody to encrypt but\nnot decrypt, so they can't decrypt and\n\n475\n00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.320\nget at my data, right?\n\n476\n00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.310\nThe private key stayed right here.\n\n477\n00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:56.346\nNow, if somebody gets ahold of\nthe private key in this machine,\n\n478\n00:23:56.346 --> 00:23:59.958\nthey could then leverage that to\nintercept and modify management traffic.\n\n479\n00:23:59.958 --> 00:24:00.694\nAnd now in theory,\n\n480\n00:24:00.694 --> 00:24:03.638\nthey could take control of hundreds of\nthousands of machines in my company.\n\n481\n00:24:03.638 --> 00:24:05.217\nThat would be bad, right?\n\n482\n00:24:05.217 --> 00:24:08.155\nBut it's the same risk as somebody\nbreaking into your machine anyway.\n\n483\n00:24:08.155 --> 00:24:12.070\nYou need to secure whatever server it\nis that's running your Profile Manager.\n\n484\n00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:13.530\nThis is a sensitive machine.\n\n485\n00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:18.110\nIf you've got the Profile Manager and\nsomebody takes it over, well,\n\n486\n00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.760\nall the clients are looking at\nthat server for management.\n\n487\n00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.150\nSo all they have to do is say, hm,\nlet me go in the Profile Manager, and\n\n488\n00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:27.600\nI'm gonna tell it to create a user account\ncalled Don on everybody's machine, and\n\n489\n00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.030\nmake it an admin, and the push it out.\n\n490\n00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.110\nWell, now, there might be 1,000\nmachines in that network.\n\n491\n00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.910\nI just go an admin account on all\n1,000 of them, just like that.\n\n492\n00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:39.600\nThat's what could happen if somebody takes\nover your profile manager, that's bad.\n\n493\n00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.950\nSo you need to take care of this machine.\n\n494\n00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:46.490\nDon't expose it to the Internet\nany more than you have to, right?\n\n495\n00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.870\nWe need it to be able\nto reach out to Apple.\n\n496\n00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:50.990\nApple doesn't need to reach\nback to the Profile Manager.\n\n497\n00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:54.260\nRight, you don't want any ports on your\nfirewall allowing Internet traffic\n\n498\n00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.050\nto make it to your Profile Manager.\n\n499\n00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:59.120\nYour Profile Manager will\ntalk through Apple, right?\n\n500\n00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.930\nSo it's got outgoing traffic,\nnot incoming traffic, and\n\n501\n00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:03.880\nso that's all kind of\nan important thing to remember.\n\n502\n00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:08.204\nThis is a sensitive machine, and\nnot emotionally, but security-wise.\n\n503\n00:25:08.204 --> 00:25:12.362\n[LAUGH] All right, so now we're done with\nthe device manager and the wizard here\n\n504\n00:25:12.362 --> 00:25:15.510\nis just telling me to click Finish,\nwhich is exciting, and then it's done.\n\n505\n00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:17.870\nNow I'm set up for device management,\nwhich is important.\n\n506\n00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:21.460\nNow I'm connected to Apple, and\nI can manage machines on my network and\n\n507\n00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.540\nmachines outside of the network,\nall right.\n\n508\n00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.710\nThere's two more settings here\nthat are kind of important.\n\n509\n00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:29.844\nIf you're an enterprise or if you're a\nschool you may already be a part of these\n\n510\n00:25:29.844 --> 00:25:31.720\nprograms so\nlet's talk about them real quick.\n\n511\n00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.300\nThe first one is Enroll devices using\nthe Device Enrollment Program, all right?\n\n512\n00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.220\nAnd the second one is Distribute apps and\nbooks from the Volume Purchase Program.\n\n513\n00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.629\nBasically, the way I'm set up right now,\nI am a Profile Manager.\n\n514\n00:25:43.629 --> 00:25:46.630\nI haven't flipped the on switch yet\nbut I am a Profile Manager.\n\n515\n00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:50.475\nAnd I can take 1 or 10, 100,\n1,000, 10,000 machines and\n\n516\n00:25:50.475 --> 00:25:52.710\nI can connect them to\nthis Profile Manager.\n\n517\n00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:54.710\nI gotta do it by hand though.\n\n518\n00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:58.036\nIf I have 10,000 machines,\nI've gotta go and do it 10,000 times.\n\n519\n00:25:58.036 --> 00:26:01.475\nRight, now in real life I'd fire Apple\nRemote Desktop and I would use that to\n\n520\n00:26:01.475 --> 00:26:04.618\nbind them all the Profile Manager,\nthere's ways to make it easier.\n\n521\n00:26:04.618 --> 00:26:07.250\nBut I would have to do at 10,000 times.\n\n522\n00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:11.540\nWell, if I'm an enterprise and\nI'm buying 10,000 Macs, Apple likes me.\n\n523\n00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.430\nRight, Apple loves it when you\nbuy a lot of equipment from them.\n\n524\n00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:16.540\nAnd so if you buy lot of equipment,\n\n525\n00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:19.580\nyou can enroll in what's called\nthe Device Enrollment Program.\n\n526\n00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:23.230\nAnd this is where whenever\nyou buy Macs from Apple,\n\n527\n00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:28.120\nwhenever you place a new order,\nahead of time they will send you\n\n528\n00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.792\nthe hardware IDs, the MAC addresses for\nevery single one of your Macs.\n\n529\n00:26:31.792 --> 00:26:35.030\nAnd they'll send it in a CSV and you can\nimport right into the Profile Manager.\n\n530\n00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:39.510\nAnd so you can get these machines\nset up even before they show up.\n\n531\n00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:42.127\nAnd so the day you receive them\nyou take them out of the box,\n\n532\n00:26:42.127 --> 00:26:45.493\nyou set them on the network, you press\nthe power button, and they enroll,\n\n533\n00:26:45.493 --> 00:26:47.860\nand they connect, and\nyou can manage them, right?\n\n534\n00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.030\nSo now it makes things a lot easier.\n\n535\n00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:51.215\nBut you gotta buy a lot of equipment.\n\n536\n00:26:51.215 --> 00:26:53.560\nIf you have 100 Macs, not enough, right.\n\n537\n00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.260\nWe're talking thousands, right,\nit's gotta be quite a few.\n\n538\n00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.620\nSame thing goes with\nthe volume purchase program.\n\n539\n00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.330\nIf you're buying a lot of apps, you buy\na lot of apps or books if you're a school.\n\n540\n00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.940\nThis is where we really see this,\nlike a university.\n\n541\n00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.645\nYou can be getting into that\nvolume purchase program.\n\n542\n00:27:06.645 --> 00:27:09.273\nAnd as part of that we can\nsay any time we get a new app\n\n543\n00:27:09.273 --> 00:27:12.403\nthrough volume purchase that\nwe automatically distribute\n\n544\n00:27:12.403 --> 00:27:16.030\nthat out to all of our devices that\nare enrolled here on the system.\n\n545\n00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:18.880\nSo leveraging these two,\nif you're a small or\n\n546\n00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.730\na medium business,\nyou're not going to be able to.\n\n547\n00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.670\nYou just don't have the purchasing power.\n\n548\n00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:28.190\nBut if you're a university or\na high school, anything like that, you\n\n549\n00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:32.780\nmay have enough Macs that you can enroll\nin these, and it saves you a lot of time.\n\n550\n00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.810\nAnd all you do is check that\nyou're a part of that program,\n\n551\n00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.800\nand then you have to run through\na little wizard to specify it.\n\n552\n00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.010\nSee how it's asking me to\nCreate an Account and all that.\n\n553\n00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:42.611\nAnd it's because it needs\nto get connected to that.\n\n554\n00:27:42.611 --> 00:27:45.136\nI don't have the purchasing\npower to do these so\n\n555\n00:27:45.136 --> 00:27:47.035\nI'm gonna have to cancel that one.\n\n556\n00:27:47.035 --> 00:27:50.310\nAnd Apple's not very nice about giving\nout demo accounts for these things so\n\n557\n00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:54.140\nit's not, I mean you actually have to have\nthat purchasing power to get into it.\n\n558\n00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.990\nIf you ever want to know how to set it up,\n\n559\n00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:59.710\nif you have the purchasing power to do\nthis, all you have to do is call Apple and\n\n560\n00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:01.490\nthey'll actually walk\nyou through the setup.\n\n561\n00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:04.209\nCuz, again, they like you,\nyou buy a lot of stuff so\n\n562\n00:28:04.209 --> 00:28:06.560\n[LAUGH] they're gonna take care of you.\n\n563\n00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.090\nAll right,\ndown below there's a few more settings.\n\n564\n00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:12.540\nThe next one is\nDefault Configuration Profile, all right.\n\n565\n00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.940\nWhat this means is,\nevery device that connects up,\n\n566\n00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:17.500\nthese are gonna be the default settings.\n\n567\n00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.350\nThese settings are gonna\napply to everyone, and so\n\n568\n00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.910\nthere's a profile created called,\nSettings for Everyone.\n\n569\n00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:25.060\nSome people like that name,\nsome people don't like that name.\n\n570\n00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:29.280\nBut it's Settings for Everyone, these are\nthe default settings for every OS 10 and\n\n571\n00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:33.770\niOS device in your environment, and\nthis is just kind of the default.\n\n572\n00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:37.148\nYou can change that default\nconfiguration profile to something else.\n\n573\n00:28:37.148 --> 00:28:40.500\nBut if you're just getting started,\njust leave it the way that it is.\n\n574\n00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.610\nNow we can override this by assigning\nother profiles to people, but\n\n575\n00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.390\nthis is gonna be the default.\n\n576\n00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.740\nAnd then we've got the option to digitally\nsign the configuration profiles.\n\n577\n00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:52.380\nRemember how I said we can save these\nas an XML file on a USB key and\n\n578\n00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.720\ntake them to another machine,\nplug them in, and configure them?\n\n579\n00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.480\nWell what if somebody gets\nahold of that USB key?\n\n580\n00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.220\nThey could edit the XML files,\ncouldn't they?\n\n581\n00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.080\nAnd they could start adding\nin other settings like hey,\n\n582\n00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.730\ncreate an admin account for Don.\n\n583\n00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:06.000\nSet the password to password123\ncuz what do we care.\n\n584\n00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.360\nAnd then you take that USB key to other\nmachines, and you install the profile and\n\n585\n00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.320\nnow you've got an admin account.\n\n586\n00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.937\nThat's the kinda stuff that somebody\ncould do if they could modify the files.\n\n587\n00:29:13.937 --> 00:29:18.800\nIf we digitally sign them and they get\nmodified, they won't work anymore.\n\n588\n00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.990\nSo this ensures those files\ndon't get tampered with.\n\n589\n00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:23.870\nIf you're distributing\nthe files via your network,\n\n590\n00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:25.900\nyou probably don't need\nto worry about this.\n\n591\n00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.960\nBut if you're distributing\nthe files via USB key or\n\n592\n00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.440\nfiles that you save on the hard drive,\n\n593\n00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:35.510\nthen this is a great extra step you can go\nthrough to ensure that your data is safe.\n\n594\n00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:39.390\nNow see how there's a Configure button and\nit's kinda grayed out?\n\n595\n00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:41.940\nWell, that's because I got this little\nwindow that popped up asking me what\n\n596\n00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.850\ncertificate I'm gonna use to sign it.\n\n597\n00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.870\nAnd I can come through and I can pick\nthat certificate that I wanna use.\n\n598\n00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.790\nAnd now that I've picked the certificate,\nthat button lights up.\n\n599\n00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:52.030\nAnd the only thing it really lets me do\nis change to a different certificate,\n\n600\n00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.690\nwhich is what I would do\nonce this one expired.\n\n601\n00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:58.600\n>> Don, I know that another use for\ndigital signatures on software is proofing\n\n602\n00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.200\nthat the software doesn't\nhave any corruptions in it.\n\n603\n00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.480\nIs there any relation or\nis this moreso just to ensure that\n\n604\n00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.550\nyou know where the configuration\nprofile's coming that it is a valid one?\n\n605\n00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:10.090\nDoes it have any relation to\ndigital signatures that we\n\n606\n00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.090\nensure that software isn't corrupted?\n\n607\n00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:13.710\n>> Yeah, I mean basically, we're not so\n\n608\n00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:16.710\nmuch worried about corruption as we\nare worried about tampering, right?\n\n609\n00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:18.960\nSo if somebody tampers with it,\nthat'll be a red flag.\n\n610\n00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.410\nBut it also lets us see that yes, this\nprofile did come from this server that I\n\n611\n00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:25.790\ntrust and it hasn't been tampered with.\n\n612\n00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:27.790\nSo it's, what are the official terms, Wes?\n\n613\n00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:31.400\nIt's integrity and-\n>> Confidentiality, integrity, and\n\n614\n00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.250\navailability, yup.\n\n615\n00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.210\n>> So we're, the security CIA triad,\n\n616\n00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:37.130\nright, that they always talk\nabout in the security world.\n\n617\n00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:40.440\nSo this is mostly integrity\nthat we're worried about.\n\n618\n00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.890\nIt is coming from the server that\nwe expect it to come from and\n\n619\n00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:43.780\nit hasn't been tampered with.\n\n620\n00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:45.940\nThat's what that's providing us.\n\n621\n00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.030\nAnd you can turn it off.\n\n622\n00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:50.039\nI'm actually gonna turn it off on mine\nbecause I haven't bound my client to\n\n623\n00:30:50.039 --> 00:30:51.042\nthe Open Directory yet so\n\n624\n00:30:51.042 --> 00:30:54.920\nit's just gonna be another error box that\nI get cuz I don't trust that certificate.\n\n625\n00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.250\nIf I bind it to the Open Directory I'll\ntrust it and that'll work just fine.\n\n626\n00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:01.550\nAll right, the last two buttons\ndown here are grayed out, right.\n\n627\n00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:04.190\nAnd what these are, are the two webpages.\n\n628\n00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:06.843\nThere's two different web servers,\nthat are a part of,\n\n629\n00:31:06.843 --> 00:31:09.441\nwell, not different servers,\nit's one web server and\n\n630\n00:31:09.441 --> 00:31:12.970\ntwo different sets of webpages\ninside of the Profile Manager.\n\n631\n00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.730\nOne for the client and one for the admins.\n\n632\n00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:18.230\nAs an admin we'll want to\ngo to this Profile Manager.\n\n633\n00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:21.690\nThat's were we go to set up all of\nthe profiles and control the devices.\n\n634\n00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:24.860\nAs an end user,\nyou'll want to go to My Devices.\n\n635\n00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.310\nWhen you go to My Devices, you'll be able\nto see each of your devices that you've\n\n636\n00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:31.822\nregistered with the Profile Manager, and\nyou can remote wipe them and lock them.\n\n637\n00:31:31.822 --> 00:31:35.143\nIt's kinda like the whole iCloud webpages,\nyou know, Find My iPhone.\n\n638\n00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:37.117\nYou can do that through\nthe Profile Manager too and\n\n639\n00:31:37.117 --> 00:31:38.390\nthis would be the page for that.\n\n640\n00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:39.730\nSo there's two different pages.\n\n641\n00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.920\nThe reason it's grayed out right now\nis I haven't turned this thing on.\n\n642\n00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.580\nIf I go up here and hit my On switch and\n\n643\n00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:49.980\nflip that on, the server's gonna start and\nI'll see those buttons light up.\n\n644\n00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.680\nWell, it's still starting,\nI have to be a little patient.\n\n645\n00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.219\nIt's creating the web server,\nit's copying the web files over,\n\n646\n00:31:55.219 --> 00:31:57.860\nit's doing all the little things\nthat it's gotta do the first time.\n\n647\n00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.980\nThere we go, it's up and\nit's running and now, there we go.\n\n648\n00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.800\nThose two little buttons are lit up and\n\n649\n00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.480\nthese buttons are just\na convenience factor.\n\n650\n00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.360\nIf you know the URL you can browse\nright to it, but if you don't\n\n651\n00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.490\nknow the URL you can click on these\nbuttons, it'll take you to the pages.\n\n652\n00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:13.010\nThe pages are available to anybody.\n\n653\n00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:16.240\nAnybody that can get to this web server,\nthey can browse that web page.\n\n654\n00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.480\nThey'll have to log in, right,\nyou can't just access whatever you want.\n\n655\n00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.210\nBut once you log in,\nyou're able to manage the server.\n\n656\n00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:24.630\nSo as far as the OS X server app,\n\n657\n00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:28.070\nthat's really the last of what we're\ngonna do for the Profile Manager.\n\n658\n00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:31.790\nIt's configured and it's turned on,\nbut everything else we're gonna do,\n\n659\n00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:34.060\nwe're gonna do via that web interface.\n\n660\n00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.670\nThat's where we're really gonna get\nthe work done with the Profile Manager.\n\n661\n00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:38.630\nHere we've just set it up and\nturned it on.\n\n662\n00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:42.355\n>> Lot of good information in\nconfiguration profiles and we've been\n\n663\n00:32:42.355 --> 00:32:46.624\nshowing you how to set up the Profile\nManager and some of the prerequisites.\n\n664\n00:32:46.624 --> 00:32:50.134\nNow Don, I know you still have to\nshow us how to use this darn thing,\n\n665\n00:32:50.134 --> 00:32:52.466\nbut I do see that the time\nhas come to the end.\n\n666\n00:32:52.466 --> 00:32:54.490\nSo it looks like we're gonna have\nto save that for a part two.\n\n667\n00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:57.640\nBut before we go, Don,\ngot any parting words of wisdom?\n\n668\n00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:01.090\n>> The main thing is, there's a lot\nof great solutions out there for\n\n669\n00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:02.320\nmanaging your devices.\n\n670\n00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.710\nI really do like the Profile Manager.\n\n671\n00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:07.470\nIt's pretty easy to use, it's part of the\nserver app, it's easy to implement, and\n\n672\n00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:09.180\nit's got a ton of features.\n\n673\n00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.820\nBut the best part about it,\nit's from Apple.\n\n674\n00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:14.470\nSo if something goes wrong with it,\nyou've only got one place to go, and\n\n675\n00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:15.160\nthat's Apple, right?\n\n676\n00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.095\nWe say it's one throat to choke.\n\n677\n00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:19.840\n[LAUGH] If something goes wrong,\nyou know it's Apple's fault.\n\n678\n00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.460\nVersus if you do a third party MDM,\nnow you've got Apple and\n\n679\n00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.878\nthat third party involved and you get\npeople pointing fingers at each other.\n\n680\n00:33:25.878 --> 00:33:29.303\nSo it's a great solution,\ndon't overlook it.\n\n681\n00:33:29.303 --> 00:33:31.846\nIdeally, you'll wanna deploy\nwith an Open Directory.\n\n682\n00:33:31.846 --> 00:33:33.959\nAnd that way you've got\ntrusted certificates in place.\n\n683\n00:33:33.959 --> 00:33:36.377\nOtherwise you've gotta manage\nthe certificate side of things and\n\n684\n00:33:36.377 --> 00:33:37.465\nthat gets a little bit hairy.\n\n685\n00:33:37.465 --> 00:33:40.566\nBut if you deploy with an Open Directory,\nthings go really smooth and\n\n686\n00:33:40.566 --> 00:33:43.210\nit's a great solution so\ndefinitely check it out.\n\n687\n00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:45.950\n>> Well Don, thank you for that\ninformation, and thank you, the viewer,\n\n688\n00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:46.710\nfor watching us.\n\n689\n00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:48.250\nCome back and see us in part two.\n\n690\n00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:50.719\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off here at ITProTV.\n\n691\n00:33:50.719 --> 00:33:52.182\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n692\n00:33:52.182 --> 00:33:53.146\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n693\n00:33:53.146 --> 00:33:55.305\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n694\n00:33:55.305 --> 00:34:02.800\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.770\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\n\n4\n00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.140\nin today's episode we're moving\nto Mac OS 10 Server Essentials.\n\n5\n00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.100\nJoining us back in the studio again for\n\n6\n00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.240\na part two of configuration profiles\nis not other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.440\nDon, how are you doing today sir?\n\n8\n00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.370\n>> I'm doing great Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.890\nI'm ready to continue on\nfrom our first episode.\n\n10\n00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.640\nFor those of you that watched part one,\n\n11\n00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.190\nyou probably noticed a little\ndiscrepancy in what we did.\n\n12\n00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.100\nWe got the profile manager set up and then\nwe didn't use the thing one single bit.\n\n13\n00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.610\nSo in this episode we're going to\nmake up for that, get in there and\n\n14\n00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.020\nactually use the profile name, right?\n\n15\n00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.050\nThe set up is in important.\n\n16\n00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.950\nEverything we covered in\nthe last episode is important.\n\n17\n00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.430\nYou gotta get the set up right.\n\n18\n00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.230\nBut once it's set up, you gotta use to\nreally get the biggest advantages out of\n\n19\n00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.420\nit, and\nthat's what we're gonna do right here.\n\n20\n00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.810\nSo I wanna pick right back\nup where we left off.\n\n21\n00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.870\nIf you didn't watch part one, make\nsure you jump back and catch that one.\n\n22\n00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.440\nBecause right now, I've already\ngot the Profile Manager deployed.\n\n23\n00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.590\nNow it's time to start using it.\n\n24\n00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.410\nNow what I kinda ended the episode\nwith was mentioning that\n\n25\n00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.230\nthere were two different web\npages we could use to manage it.\n\n26\n00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.480\nTechnically there's three management\ninterfaces to this thing.\n\n27\n00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.070\nWe saw one of them in the last episode.\n\n28\n00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.990\nThat was the server app itself.\n\n29\n00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.730\nBut we're kinda done with that everything\nthat we did in the last episode you\n\n30\n00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.010\nusually do in the beginning, and\nthen you never mess with it again.\n\n31\n00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.890\nSo we're pretty much\ndone with the server app.\n\n32\n00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.060\nThe only time I ever really return to\nthe server app for the profile manager,\n\n33\n00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.910\nis if I need to troubleshoot and\nI want to see the logs, right?\n\n34\n00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.970\nCuz you can see the logs\nreal easy in the server app.\n\n35\n00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.480\nOr if I forget the URL to the webpage, and\n\n36\n00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.890\nthen I go into the server\napp to get the URL.\n\n37\n00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.240\nBut assuming you know those addresses,\n\n38\n00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.690\nyou really don't have to go\nback to the server app for it.\n\n39\n00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.390\nAll right?\n\n40\n00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.150\nFor now on, we're going to use the other\ntwo interfaces, the web interfaces.\n\n41\n00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.020\nOne web interface is designed for\nend users, so that they can enroll and\n\n42\n00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.790\nmanage their devices.\n\n43\n00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.080\nThe second interface is for\nus as administrators, so\n\n44\n00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.620\nthat we can manage the profile manager,\nright?\n\n45\n00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.830\nA little redundant there.\n\n46\n00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.480\nBut we need an interface to be able to\ndo that, so those are the two pages.\n\n47\n00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.630\nAnd let me just fire my\nserver app back up here.\n\n48\n00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.320\nAnd if we go into the server app and\n\n49\n00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.560\nyou choose your profile manager,\nyou'll have those two buttons right down\n\n50\n00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.920\nthere at the bottom where you can\ngo in and manage your system.\n\n51\n00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.890\nNow, there's kind of\nan interesting thing here.\n\n52\n00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.050\nIn previous versions of the server app,\nyou actually had different URLs here.\n\n53\n00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.960\nIn the newer versions, it actually\npays attention to your account and\n\n54\n00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.970\nwhat you've been accessing.\n\n55\n00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.260\nSo when I click on one of these, like if\nI go to my devices and I click on open in\n\n56\n00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.420\nSafari, it's gonna fire up Safari and it's\ngonna browse to my server, and if you look\n\n57\n00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.785\nat the URL that it went to, it's browsing\nhere, and it shows that it's going to\n\n58\n00:02:41.785 --> 00:02:48.200\nos10-server01.local/devicemanagement,\nright.\n\n59\n00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.070\nSo, it's going into the device\nmanagement page, and\n\n60\n00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.810\nthat's what our end users\nare typically going to use.\n\n61\n00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.570\nIf I go back to the server app,\nthough, and\n\n62\n00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.270\nthis time I'm gonna click\non the Profile Manager one.\n\n63\n00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.210\nWhen I go into that,\nit's gonna open up another page and\n\n64\n00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.560\nthose pages look identical, right?\n\n65\n00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.200\nIn earlier versions of the server\napp they actually looked different,\n\n66\n00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.940\nnow they look the same.\n\n67\n00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.570\nAnd if I go and look at the URL It's\nactually the same URL, all right.\n\n68\n00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.270\nSo it used to be that you had\nthe server name / device management for\n\n69\n00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.310\nyour end users and the server\nname / profile manger for admins.\n\n70\n00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.980\nBut now the URLs effectively the same and\n\n71\n00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.670\nit pays attention to\nthe credentials you log in with.\n\n72\n00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.480\nIf you log in as an admin, you're\ngoing to see the admin infrastructure.\n\n73\n00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.500\nIf you log in as a regular user,\nyou're going to see.\n\n74\n00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.640\nWell the user's infrastructure and that'\nbasically the way that's going to lay out.\n\n75\n00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.320\nSo I'm going to get logged in here, and\n\n76\n00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.380\nI'm going to log in as me, assuming I\ncan remember my user name and password.\n\n77\n00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.480\nSo I'll get logged in, and it's asking\nif I want to remember my password,\n\n78\n00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.508\nprobably not a good idea but I'll save it.\n\n79\n00:03:53.508 --> 00:03:56.120\n[LAUGH] And now I'm going to log in.\n\n80\n00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.290\nAnd so when I log in,\n\n81\n00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.510\nI'm seeing the profile manager\nnot the device management screen.\n\n82\n00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.500\nIf I go to the first tab I opened, this is\nthe one where I did device management, and\n\n83\n00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.520\nif I log in here, so I can log in and\n\n84\n00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.050\nit looks different, same URL but\nit looks different.\n\n85\n00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.740\nWell the URL wasn't completely the same,\nthere were some little variables on\n\n86\n00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.820\nthe end, and it told it to show\nme the device management screen.\n\n87\n00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.500\nAnd this is the one that's going to show\nme all of the devices attached to me.\n\n88\n00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.020\nSo an end-user gets a different interface.\n\n89\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.950\nThis is what an end user will see.\n\n90\n00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.090\nThey see this Mac is the Mac that\nthey're seating at right now.\n\n91\n00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.930\nThey might have an iPhone,\nan iPad, a laptop, a desktop.\n\n92\n00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.310\nThey would see each of the devices right\nhere that were enrolled in the profile\n\n93\n00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.480\nmanager, right.\n\n94\n00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.340\nNot all the devices\nthrough the whole company.\n\n95\n00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.530\nThe ones that were enrolled and\nattached to them.\n\n96\n00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.340\nRight?\nSo their devices,\n\n97\n00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.800\nin my case I see the server and\nthat's it, and so\n\n98\n00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.300\nI can see my device and\nit's not actually enrolled yet.\n\n99\n00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.730\nI have this Mac that I'm sitting at and\nit's not enrolled in the server.\n\n100\n00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.650\nAnd we're gonna enroll\nit in a few minutes, but\n\n101\n00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.010\nthis is how we'd go in and attach it.\n\n102\n00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.630\nActually I'm not gonna enroll my server,\nI'm sorry,\n\n103\n00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.379\nwe're gonna enroll another machine.\n\n104\n00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.770\nYou can enroll your server,\nit's not a good idea.\n\n105\n00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.840\nYou can use the Profile Manager to apply a\nprofile to the Profile Manager server, but\n\n106\n00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.430\nyou can actually lock\nyourself out that way, and\n\n107\n00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.630\nyou can make it where you can't get\ninto the system and manage the server.\n\n108\n00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.540\nBad idea, typically you don't\nwant to use the Profile Manager\n\n109\n00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.940\non your Profile Manager server.\n\n110\n00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.990\nYou can use it on other servers,\nthat's fine, but\n\n111\n00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.960\nyou don't want it to manage itself.\n\n112\n00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.430\nAll right.\n\n113\n00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.400\nBut as an admin the one we care\nabout is this guy right here.\n\n114\n00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.400\nThis is the main Profile Manager page and\n\n115\n00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.130\nit's the one that's gonna let us do all\nthe cool things that make this product so\n\n116\n00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.230\nfancy, right, so\nimpressive in what it can do, all right?\n\n117\n00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.550\nNow before we really\nstart using it though,\n\n118\n00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.570\nwe do need some devices\nenrolled that we can manage.\n\n119\n00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.710\nAnd if I look in here at this UI-let,\n\n120\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.720\nlet's quickly cover what's in the UI,\nright.\n\n121\n00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.040\nSo I see Profile Manager,\nso I know where I am.\n\n122\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.260\nI've got a search box.\n\n123\n00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.010\nThe search box is used for\nsearching for users and\n\n124\n00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.350\ncomputers in groups too, I guess.\n\n125\n00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.390\nTechnically, they're all groups here.\n\n126\n00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.580\nIf you look on the left side here,\nI've got devices and\n\n127\n00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.890\ndevice groups, users and user groups.\n\n128\n00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.280\nWell, it says groups, but\nthey are user groups.\n\n129\n00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.420\nWhat happens is,\nI can enroll individual devices, and\n\n130\n00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.580\nthat's great and if I want to manage them\nI can, I can say here's Wes's laptop,\n\n131\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.360\nI'll put it in here, and\nI want Wes to have this one wallpaper.\n\n132\n00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.640\nOr I can create a group\nthat says students.\n\n133\n00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.970\nAnd I can put every student laptop or\n\n134\n00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.170\nevery student desktop\nin the Students group.\n\n135\n00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.000\nAnd now I might say, you know what?\n\n136\n00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.580\nI want every student to\nhave this new program.\n\n137\n00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.270\nAnd so I can create a profile and\napply it to the device group.\n\n138\n00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.080\nAnd every student computer\nwould get that program.\n\n139\n00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.200\nI can do it based on that, so\ngroups become really, really handy.\n\n140\n00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.820\n>> Now Don, I see there's a couple of\noptions there at the top, Apps and\n\n141\n00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.400\nBooks there.\n\n142\n00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.700\nWould this be something\nthat you'd have already?\n\n143\n00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.670\nIn the first part of this you showed\nus how we had to be part of the volume\n\n144\n00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:59.660\npurchase program.\n\n145\n00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.560\nWould you have to be part of the Volume\nPurchase program to see anything in\n\n146\n00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.760\nthe information in those loactions?\n\n147\n00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.720\n>> As far\n\n148\n00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.750\nas it have been pre-populated yes\n>> Yeah.\n\n149\n00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.440\n>> If I click on Apps or Books, right\ndown here I only have two choices and\n\n150\n00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.220\none is our Volume Purchase Program, right.\n\n151\n00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.740\nSo if I was tied to the Volume Purchase\nProgram I will be able to see all the Apps\n\n152\n00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.710\nand all the books that we had\npurchased via that program.\n\n153\n00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.980\nAnd then I can start to deploy\nthose out to the profiles, right?\n\n154\n00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.970\nIf you're not you can still use this,\nsee how you've got Enterprise App?\n\n155\n00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.890\nIf you have an Apple Developer Account for\nyour company, you can write\n\n156\n00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:35.690\napps that are not in the App Store,\nbut that you deploy right from here.\n\n157\n00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.400\nAll of your machines do need to be tied\nto your Enterprise account to be able\n\n158\n00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.210\nto do that.\n\n159\n00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.560\nBut you don't need to be a part of\nthe volume purchase program for that.\n\n160\n00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.960\nSo you can have internal Apps only.\n\n161\n00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.960\nThere's plenty of places that have created\nlike point of sales cash registers that\n\n162\n00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.120\nthey run on an iPad, and they don't\nwant to put those in an App Store.\n\n163\n00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.375\nThey don't want to sell it to other\npeople that are just doing it for\n\n164\n00:07:53.375 --> 00:07:55.451\ntheir own company, and so\nthey deploy it like this, right?\n\n165\n00:07:55.451 --> 00:07:57.423\nIt's an easy way,\nthey call it sideloading.\n\n166\n00:07:57.423 --> 00:08:01.868\nThat we can sideload these apps without\nusing the App store on the machines.\n\n167\n00:08:01.868 --> 00:08:05.584\nAll right, but for the rest of us that\naren't necessarily deploying apps and\n\n168\n00:08:05.584 --> 00:08:09.186\nbooks this way, these are the main\nelements that we're concerned about,\n\n169\n00:08:09.186 --> 00:08:12.430\nthe devices, device groups users,\nand user groups, all right?\n\n170\n00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.370\nNow down at the bottom you've got\nactive tasks, and completed tasks.\n\n171\n00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.850\nWhenever you perform an action\nin the profile manager,\n\n172\n00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.850\nif it affects one computer it'll\nprobably happen really fast.\n\n173\n00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.490\nI wanna change Wes' wallpaper.\n\n174\n00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.775\nSo it pushes it to Wes' machine,\n\n175\n00:08:26.775 --> 00:08:29.540\nWes' machine responds when\nit applies the change.\n\n176\n00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.330\nIt's an Active Task while it's running,\nand\n\n177\n00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:37.110\nthen when it's done it moves\ndown to Completed Tasks, right?\n\n178\n00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:41.370\nIf Wes' computer is off right now,\nwell, it's gonna wait.\n\n179\n00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.740\nIt's gonna stay active as it retries and\nwaits.\n\n180\n00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.030\nAnd so I'll be able to see that and\n\n181\n00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.440\nsee whether those changes\nare rolled forward or not.\n\n182\n00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.460\nIf I'm pushing a change out to 1,000\ncomputers, it might take awhile, right?\n\n183\n00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.620\nIt might take a while for\nall 1,000 computers to wake up, check in,\n\n184\n00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.150\nget the update applied, and respond that\nit's done, and so this is a great way for\n\n185\n00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.720\nyou to monitor what our progress is.\n\n186\n00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.290\nThe other stuff that you'll\nsee on here is not as obvious.\n\n187\n00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:09.110\nWay up at the top right,\nyou see your name, right?\n\n188\n00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.920\nI know what you're thinking, great, I see\nmy name, I kind of already knew that.\n\n189\n00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.790\nWell the important part here\nis that it's got a drop down.\n\n190\n00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.840\nAnd in the drop down box\nyou'll see a few things.\n\n191\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.420\nGo to My Devices.\n\n192\n00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.730\nIf you logged in as an administrator and\n\n193\n00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:26.460\nyou want to flip over to the end user\nscreen, this is how you do it, right?\n\n194\n00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.550\nJust cuz I'm an admin doesn't mean I\ncan't manage my own devices, right.\n\n195\n00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:35.030\nSo I can flip over to see it, and\nthen download trust profile, right.\n\n196\n00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.410\nI mentioned certificates\nin the last episode and\n\n197\n00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.150\nI said boy you really want\nto have an open directory,\n\n198\n00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.870\ncuz then your clients all trust your\ncertificates and things will work great.\n\n199\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.960\nOr you could use a public certificate,\none that you actually go out and\n\n200\n00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.160\npurchase from a provider on the Internet.\n\n201\n00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.140\nAnd now you've got one that\neverybody's gonna trust.\n\n202\n00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.960\nBut if you're just gonna ride it out\nwith a self signed certificate and\n\n203\n00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.430\nyou're going to just have people use your\nserver even though they don't trust it,\n\n204\n00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.500\nyou can download a trust profile.\n\n205\n00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.890\nAnd what a trust profile is,\nis it's a configuration profile.\n\n206\n00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.790\nIt's one of those .xml files, but it will\ncontain the public keys for your server.\n\n207\n00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:14.080\nAnd you can take that profile and take\nit to any Mac in the entire world, and\n\n208\n00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.070\nyou can load it on that Mac and\nthat Mac will now trust your certificates.\n\n209\n00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:21.180\nSo that way you can stay\nwith a self signed cert, but\n\n210\n00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.650\nstill have all your clients trust you.\n\n211\n00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:27.680\nIf I choose to download the trust profile,\nit's just a file, and\n\n212\n00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.625\nif I hit download,\nit's going to download it.\n\n213\n00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:35.635\nSo if I look in my Downloads, let me just\ngo into the Finder here so I can see it.\n\n214\n00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:40.077\nHere it is,\nTrust_Profile_for_ITProTV_Lab.mobilecon-\n\n215\n00:10:40.077 --> 00:10:41.125\nfig, okay?\n\n216\n00:10:41.125 --> 00:10:42.565\nThat extension right there, remember that,\n\n217\n00:10:42.565 --> 00:10:46.795\nit shows up on the exam almost every time,\n.mobileconfig.\n\n218\n00:10:46.795 --> 00:10:50.850\nIt is an XML file but they don't call\nit .xml, they call it .mobileconfig.\n\n219\n00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.440\nAnd the reason they do is so\n\n220\n00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.220\nthat your Mac will recognize that\nit is a configuration profile.\n\n221\n00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.160\nAnd so when it downloads it,\nit knows what to do.\n\n222\n00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.050\nSee how the icon is a little\ngear as opposed to a text file?\n\n223\n00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.420\nWell, it's really small.\n\n224\n00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.650\nI don't know if you guys can see that,\nbut it is a gear.\n\n225\n00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:09.850\nAnd in the background it recognized\nthat I just pulled a profile.\n\n226\n00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.130\nAnd so it launched my system preferences\nand it went right to the profiles and\n\n227\n00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.770\nnow it's offering,\ndo I want to install this trust profile?\n\n228\n00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.250\nI don't trust where this is coming from.\n\n229\n00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.590\nDo I wanna do it?\n\n230\n00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:20.160\nMaybe I don't.\n\n231\n00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:25.710\nI can hit Show Profile and see what's\nin it, and I see it's an unsigned\n\n232\n00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.560\nconfiguration profile, cuz I\nunchecked that box in the server app.\n\n233\n00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.650\nRemember in the server app we\nhad the option to choose to sign\n\n234\n00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:31.890\nthe profiles or not.\n\n235\n00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:33.250\nI didn't sign this one.\n\n236\n00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:37.770\nAnd it's telling me, install the root\ncertificates for ITProTV Lab.\n\n237\n00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.670\nIf I want somebody to\ntrust my certificates, and\n\n238\n00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:44.310\nI did self-sign certificates\nthis is the way I do it, right,\n\n239\n00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.460\nthis is the file that's gonna install it.\n\n240\n00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.000\nAnd if I look at the settings,\n\n241\n00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.860\nthe only settings in this\nfile are certificates, right.\n\n242\n00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.370\nIt's got the root cert for\nthe ITProTV lab right here, and\n\n243\n00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.510\nif I install it,\nI will now trust those certificates.\n\n244\n00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.550\nOkay, well I'm on my server so\nI don't need to do that.\n\n245\n00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.880\nI'm gonna cancel it because well,\n\n246\n00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.960\nmy server already trusts itself,\nthat's how it is.\n\n247\n00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.020\nBut on my other machines, like I've got\nthis work station sitting over here,\n\n248\n00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.680\nit doesn't trust my server, right.\n\n249\n00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.000\nAnd so I would need to load those\ncertificates on here to trust it.\n\n250\n00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.330\nAnd I could just join the open directory.\n\n251\n00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.300\nIf I bound,\nif I went to System Preferences and\n\n252\n00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:28.270\nin system preferences I can\ndive into users and groups and\n\n253\n00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:32.550\ninside of users and groups you\ncan go to your login options and\n\n254\n00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.550\nthen right here you've got\nnetwork account server, right.\n\n255\n00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.970\nSo I could bind to the open directory.\n\n256\n00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.300\nAnd now I'm gonna trust the certs\non an open directory, right?\n\n257\n00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:46.690\nBut if I don't want to do this,\nmaybe I'm at a school and\n\n258\n00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.480\nevery kid has to bring in their own iPad.\n\n259\n00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:54.230\nIt's their iPad, it's not ours right, and\niPad's can't bind in the Open Directory.\n\n260\n00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.290\nAnyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.\n\n261\n00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:59.490\nSo if that bringing their own MacBook Air,\nthey can bind in the Open Directory.\n\n262\n00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.820\nSo we want them to do that,\nbecause it's their own MacBook.\n\n263\n00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.710\nAt the end of the review they're\ngonna go home and they have it right.\n\n264\n00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:09.450\nSo I don't have to necessarily bind\nthem I can just load that trust profile.\n\n265\n00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:14.030\nAnd so what you can do is you can take\nthis profile, this mobile config, and\n\n266\n00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.630\nyou can put in on a USB key and\ntake it to those machines, or\n\n267\n00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.410\nput it on network share so they can\njust browse the network and get at it.\n\n268\n00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:27.630\nSo I can take that and go in and\ncreate a network share somewhere.\n\n269\n00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.970\nHere, let me go back\ninto my server app and\n\n270\n00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:34.370\nI'll go into my file sharing, all right?\n\n271\n00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.430\nAnd I'm gonna create a new file share,\n\n272\n00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:40.050\nwe can just do one right here in my\ndocuments folder, it'll be fine.\n\n273\n00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:46.160\nAnd I'll just call it my trust profile,\nall right.\n\n274\n00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.500\nAnd I'm going to set that one so\nthat everybody can get at it.\n\n275\n00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.670\nSo I just created a shared\nfolder called Trust Profile.\n\n276\n00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.220\nIt's available via all these\nvarious profile protocols.\n\n277\n00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.820\nAnd everyone else has read only so\nthat's good.\n\n278\n00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.790\nEveryone's gonna have access to\nthis one so that's fine, all right.\n\n279\n00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:04.020\nAnd now what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna take that trust profile and\n\n280\n00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:04.880\nI'm just gonna copy it.\n\n281\n00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.830\nAnd I'm gonna stick it in that folder.\n\n282\n00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:12.840\nAnd that way I can go to any client and I\ncan just double click that and install it.\n\n283\n00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.270\nSo when I go back over here to this\nclient, it doesn't know my server.\n\n284\n00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.850\nIt's not bound to the open directory.\n\n285\n00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.350\nIt has no attachment to\nthat server whatsoever.\n\n286\n00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:24.890\nBut I can fire up the Finder,\nI can browse the network and\n\n287\n00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:26.720\nI can find that server, right?\n\n288\n00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.900\nSo that server is sitting\nout there somewhere.\n\n289\n00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.290\nI say I can find it.\n\n290\n00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.220\nYou know it's not showing up.\n\n291\n00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.030\nI'm seeing everybody else's stuff but\nI'm not seeing that Mac.\n\n292\n00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.670\nSo, let's just browse\nthe old fashioned way.\n\n293\n00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:41.130\nWe'll connect to a server.\n\n294\n00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.710\nSo I'm just gonna punch\nin the IP of that server.\n\n295\n00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.950\nAnd what did I call that thing?\n\n296\n00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.500\nI called it Trust Profile, didn't I?\n\n297\n00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:50.190\n>> Yep.\n\n298\n00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.659\n>> All right, so\nwe're gonna try and connect.\n\n299\n00:14:54.422 --> 00:14:54.951\nAll right, Wes,\n\n300\n00:14:54.951 --> 00:14:57.790\nthis is another one of those embarrassing\nmoments where I've made a stupid mistake.\n\n301\n00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.622\nSo I configure that file share, and\nI think I forgot to turn on file sharing.\n\n302\n00:15:01.622 --> 00:15:03.660\n[LAUGH] So\nlet me jump back over to my server.\n\n303\n00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:08.030\nAnd, yeah, sure enough, I went through\nthe trouble of creating that folder, but\n\n304\n00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.860\nI kinda forgot to flip this big on switch.\n\n305\n00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.310\nSo, let me do that now real quick,\ncuz that'll probably help us get to that.\n\n306\n00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:17.460\nAnd then I'll jump back over here and\nlet's see if we can browse and\n\n307\n00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.040\nconnect that one now.\n\n308\n00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.510\nThere we go, all right.\n\n309\n00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.160\nSo, I'm gonna browse, and\nI can connect as a guest, or\n\n310\n00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.820\nat least I should be able to\nbecause I set it for everyone.\n\n311\n00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.080\nWell, you know what, it's going\nto complain about that, isn't it?\n\n312\n00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.400\nI'll log in, it's fine.\n\n313\n00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.960\nSo, I'm going to get\nconnected to that one.\n\n314\n00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.020\nAnd, I just need to get that file,\nall right.\n\n315\n00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:33.720\nGet that one in.\n\n316\n00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.090\nI could've copied it over\nwith a USB key or whatever.\n\n317\n00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:40.270\nAnd if I double-click on that, it's going\nto go load the trust profile, right?\n\n318\n00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.370\nSo here it goes,\nit's asking Do I want to install?\n\n319\n00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:44.680\nAnd if I hit continue,\nit's gonna load it in and\n\n320\n00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.460\nhere it's warning me this\nprofile's authorship is unknown.\n\n321\n00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.630\nWe don't know who created this, right?\n\n322\n00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:54.810\nOnce installed IT PROTV lab open director\ncertificate authority will be trusted\n\n323\n00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.220\non this Mac, right.\n\n324\n00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.628\nIt's the open directory certificate.\n\n325\n00:15:57.628 --> 00:16:00.553\nI would've trusted this if I\njoined the open directory anyway,\n\n326\n00:16:00.553 --> 00:16:02.350\nnow I'm just making it happen myself.\n\n327\n00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.084\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and install that,\n\n328\n00:16:04.084 --> 00:16:07.148\nyou do need to be an administrator on\nthe local machine to install that.\n\n329\n00:16:07.148 --> 00:16:09.079\nAnd now it's there, okay.\n\n330\n00:16:09.079 --> 00:16:12.285\nSo I've got this trust profile\napplied to my machine so\n\n331\n00:16:12.285 --> 00:16:16.420\nthat now I will trust\nthe certificates from the other side.\n\n332\n00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.540\nThis, for the most part,\ntakes effect right away.\n\n333\n00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.710\nThere are some things you have to reboot\nbefore they fully take effect for but for\n\n334\n00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.420\nthe most part this will be, I might still\nget a certificate warning cuz I haven't\n\n335\n00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.920\nrebooted but I'll leave that be for now.\n\n336\n00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.010\nAll right, so back on the server,\nwhat does that do for me?\n\n337\n00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.630\nWell, not a whole heck of a lot.\n\n338\n00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.280\nSo I've got the client where\nI trust my certificates but\n\n339\n00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:40.170\nI still haven't actually enrolled it and I\nknow that because in the profile managers\n\n340\n00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:44.770\nscreen, if I go to devices, I'll see\nall the devices I'm currently managing.\n\n341\n00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.810\nI'm not managing a darn one right now.\n\n342\n00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.960\nSo I don't have anything in the list.\n\n343\n00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.579\nI need to go and enroll somebody.\n\n344\n00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:53.230\nHow do I enroll them?\n\n345\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.700\nWell, I just go to that machine.\n\n346\n00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.730\nI browse to the profile manager and\nI enroll it.\n\n347\n00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:59.320\nRight?\n\n348\n00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:03.010\nSo what I'm going to do,\nis I'm going to go back to this client.\n\n349\n00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.600\nAnd I'm going to fire up good old Safari.\n\n350\n00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.730\nAnd I'm gonna browse to that server.\n\n351\n00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:14.143\nSo we'll browse to my server\nwhich is going to be, oops,\n\n352\n00:17:14.143 --> 00:17:21.655\nhttp://osx-server01.local/devicemanagem-\nent.\n\n353\n00:17:21.655 --> 00:17:22.262\nOkay?\n\n354\n00:17:22.262 --> 00:17:26.180\nAnd again if you forget that\nURL you can go in and find it.\n\n355\n00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.180\nAnd did I do the wrong?\n\n356\n00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.359\nLet's see, we had to do it as https.\n\n357\n00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:35.450\nAll right.\nSo,\n\n358\n00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:36.970\nit's telling me websites are turned off,\n\n359\n00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.710\nwhich is kind of funny cuz\nwe know we went to it.\n\n360\n00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:39.830\nSo I must have URL wrong.\n\n361\n00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.816\nSo let me go back here and see, we might\nhave a port number that I'm leaving out,\n\n362\n00:17:42.816 --> 00:17:46.580\nand, shoot, /mydevices.\n\n363\n00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.470\nI got the wrong URL.\n\n364\n00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:50.200\nSo, I went to device management,\nwhich is the old one.\n\n365\n00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.730\nSo let me change that to Slash my devices.\n\n366\n00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.110\nIt helps if we use the right URL.\n\n367\n00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.700\nThere we go.\n\n368\n00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.560\nAll right, so just for memory there,\n\n369\n00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:05.560\nit was osx-server01.local, that's\nthe name of my server, slash my devices.\n\n370\n00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.290\nAnd once I go there, I get the log\nin screen so I can come in here and\n\n371\n00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:12.960\nI can log in with my account, and if we\nhave an open directory that's the account\n\n372\n00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:18.250\nyou're gonna log in with, and once you\nlog in, you'll see your devices, right.\n\n373\n00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:21.220\nAnd I see this Mac and\nI can go in and I can enroll it.\n\n374\n00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:25.340\nNow my Mac, if I go into\nSystem Preferences and Sharing,\n\n375\n00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.890\nwhat is my Mac called?\n\n376\n00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.160\nIt's just called Don's Mac right?\n\n377\n00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.410\nSo not a very creative name, but\nI'm gonna go ahead and enroll it.\n\n378\n00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:36.350\nWhen you enroll it what it's doing is\ndownloading another profile manager,\n\n379\n00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:37.150\npack, right?\n\n380\n00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:40.050\nSo here we got a another\nprofile that's coming down, but\n\n381\n00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.900\nthis one contains a lot more in it.\n\n382\n00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.180\nIt contains a certificate.\n\n383\n00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.460\nRight?\nWe We saw that a minute ago.\n\n384\n00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:51.270\nBut this also contains Mobile Device\nManagement and SCEP Enrollment Request.\n\n385\n00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.580\nThat's going to give us the security\ncontrols that will allow us to\n\n386\n00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:57.740\nremotely lock and wipe and\nlocate the machine.\n\n387\n00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:58.850\nAll the fancy bells and\n\n388\n00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.650\nwhistles that we want,\nit's gonna give us all that capability.\n\n389\n00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:02.960\nAll right so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n390\n00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.740\ncontinue to add that and\nit's just warning me are you sure?\n\n391\n00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.300\nI'll go ahead and\n\n392\n00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:12.430\ntell it to install and now we're gonna\nget set up to connect to that system.\n\n393\n00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:17.190\nSo I've got my trust profile that I loaded\nthat just had the certificates, and\n\n394\n00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.500\nnow I've got remote management\nwhich has a lot more in it.\n\n395\n00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.990\nRight, the MDM and\nall those other Things, okay.\n\n396\n00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:27.390\nSo now that I've got them,\nthis machine is officially enrolled and\n\n397\n00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.100\nnow I'm able to manage it.\n\n398\n00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.030\n>> Don, with that, mobile you talked\nabout that file extension and\n\n399\n00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:34.850\nit being important, right, .mobileconfig.\n\n400\n00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:38.820\nWhen I think of mobile config,\nthe first thing that comes to mind is MDM,\n\n401\n00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.700\nMobile Device Management and\nmore so, BYOD.\n\n402\n00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.290\nIs the trust profile and\n\n403\n00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:47.000\nthe extension the same regardless of\nwhether you have a MAC or IOS device?\n\n404\n00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.840\n>> It is and it isn't, so it is.\n\n405\n00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.360\nIt is a double mo config.\n\n406\n00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.720\nThe part that isn't is on a iPhone or\nan iPad, you have\n\n407\n00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.860\nto push this with the Apple Configurator,\nso it's a little bit different.\n\n408\n00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.390\nIt's not just you copy a file and\nyou run it,\n\n409\n00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:04.210\ncuz the iOS devices don't have a true file\nmanager like what we're used to, right.\n\n410\n00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.460\nSo, while there is a mobile config file,\nyou never actually see that.\n\n411\n00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.195\nThe Apple configurator takes care of that.\n\n412\n00:20:09.195 --> 00:20:10.440\n>> Gotcha.\n\n413\n00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.640\n>> All right.\nSo I see the My Devices screen is now\n\n414\n00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.300\na little different.\n\n415\n00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.930\nRight?\nIt shows This Mac and I've got a lock and\n\n416\n00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.000\na wipe button.\n\n417\n00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.620\nRight.\n\n418\n00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.000\nAnd I'm seeing that here on This Mac.\n\n419\n00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.280\nBut I can now go to any Mac in my\nentire company Log in to My Devices and\n\n420\n00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:29.020\nI'll see Don's Mac in the list and I'll\nbe able to lock and wipe it and whatever.\n\n421\n00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.580\nRight?\n\n422\n00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.590\nAnd under Profiles you'll see\nthe different profiles that I can\n\n423\n00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:32.700\ndownload and load.\n\n424\n00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.610\nThe only ones I have right\nnow are the Trust Profile and\n\n425\n00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.190\nthe Settings for Everyone that\nwe're gonna see here in a minute.\n\n426\n00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:38.950\nAll right.\n\n427\n00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:44.440\nAnd if I go back to my server and\nI go back to my Profile Manager\n\n428\n00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.670\nscreen here Devices was empty before,\nand now it's got Don's Mac, right there.\n\n429\n00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:52.250\nSo, I've got Don's Mac, and it's in place.\n\n430\n00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:57.040\nAnd I can now start to adjust and modify\nsettings just for that laptop if I want.\n\n431\n00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.100\nOr, I can create groups.\n\n432\n00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.870\nAnd I can put it into a group and\nstart to manage things that way,\n\n433\n00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:03.180\nwhich is a little more ideal.\n\n434\n00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.090\nRight?\n\n435\n00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:07.810\nSo creating groups is one of the first\nthings I'll do when I set up\n\n436\n00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:08.440\na Profile Manager.\n\n437\n00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.800\nYou've got to understand\nhow you're gonna use it.\n\n438\n00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.220\nSo under Device Groups you don't\nhave any device groups by default.\n\n439\n00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.530\nThat's a little different\nthan the other groups.\n\n440\n00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:17.790\nLet me show you the other groups.\n\n441\n00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.680\nIf we go to users, you'll see\nthe user accounts that you've got,\n\n442\n00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.140\nand if you're on open directory you'll\nsee the various open directory accounts.\n\n443\n00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.820\nIf you go under groups,\nyou'll see the groups that you have and\n\n444\n00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.850\nthere's one group by default called,\nEveryone.\n\n445\n00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:31.790\nCoincidentally, this has everyone in it.\n\n446\n00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.930\nYou can create your own\ngroups if you want.\n\n447\n00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:37.260\nWhen you create these groups,\nthey show up in the server app.\n\n448\n00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:43.080\nSo for example let's say that I\nhave students and teachers, right?\n\n449\n00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:46.780\nWell under Groups you can hit\nthe little plus sign down here,\n\n450\n00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.160\nand I can't add a group.\n\n451\n00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.040\nI can add an enrollment profile but\nI can't add a group.\n\n452\n00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.920\nAnd there's no other little\noption here to add groups.\n\n453\n00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.000\nWhy is that?\n\n454\n00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.380\nWell the users and\ngroups that we see here are the users and\n\n455\n00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.490\ngroups from Open Directory and\nfrom the underlying MAC OS.\n\n456\n00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:04.920\nSo we manage those from the server app.\n\n457\n00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.520\nIf I wanna create students and teachers,\nI need to go into my server app, and\n\n458\n00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.150\nI need to get them set up there.\n\n459\n00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:15.280\nSo I'm gonna jump back to my server app\nand I'll just create the Azure Quick.\n\n460\n00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:20.860\nAnd then what we'll see is those show\nup back in the profile manager, okay.\n\n461\n00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:25.400\nSo here I'm in my server app and\nif I go to users I got Don Peszet, right.\n\n462\n00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.360\nI get come in and add somebody.\n\n463\n00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:32.248\nLet's add Wes so I'll create a [INAUDIBLE]\naccount.\n\n464\n00:22:32.248 --> 00:22:36.760\nAnd we'll give you a super secure\npassword that nobody can possibly guess.\n\n465\n00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.891\n>> Love the dots.\n\n466\n00:22:37.891 --> 00:22:39.795\n>> [LAUGH] We'll get that one created.\n\n467\n00:22:39.795 --> 00:22:41.630\nSo now Wes has a user account.\n\n468\n00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:43.470\nAnd then I can go under groups and\n\n469\n00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:48.450\nunder groups maybe I'll create a student\ngroup, so those will be my students.\n\n470\n00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.460\nAnd then I'll create a teachers group,\nright.\n\n471\n00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:55.520\nSo I'm creating all\nthe groups that I want.\n\n472\n00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:00.630\nWhen I go back into the profile manager,\nsee how students and teachers showed up.\n\n473\n00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:04.000\nAnd if I go under Users,\nsee how Wes showed up, right.\n\n474\n00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.650\nSo we don't create users in\ngroups from the Profile Manager.\n\n475\n00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:07.720\nWe create them from the server app.\n\n476\n00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.430\nBut what about computers?\n\n477\n00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.890\nWhat about devices and device groups?\n\n478\n00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:15.500\nWell the server app doesn't have those.\n\n479\n00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.930\nIt doesn't have a way for managing those.\n\n480\n00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:19.810\nThose you do create from\nthe profile manager.\n\n481\n00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:21.790\nThose exist just right here.\n\n482\n00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:26.620\nSo when I go to devices,\nI actually do have a plus sign down here.\n\n483\n00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.360\nI can add devices.\n\n484\n00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.770\nYou can add a placeholder if it's\na device that's coming soon,\n\n485\n00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:32.890\nand you can import placeholders.\n\n486\n00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:37.030\nThat's what you would do if you're\na part of the volume purchase or\n\n487\n00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.010\nthe enterprise enrollment program.\n\n488\n00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:44.330\nSo you could get the little CSV and\nimport then have them all or the added.\n\n489\n00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:47.350\nBut the easiest way to add\na machine here is just go to it and\n\n490\n00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:49.750\nenroll it like we did with Don's Mac.\n\n491\n00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:53.670\nThen if I look under device groups, well\nthere's nothing here but I can add some.\n\n492\n00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:59.200\nAnd so I might create a device\ngroup called students or\n\n493\n00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.160\nI'll call it student machines.\n\n494\n00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.420\nRight?\nSo this is going to be all student\n\n495\n00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:02.930\nmachines.\n\n496\n00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.598\nSo we'll get that put in there,\nand my head is covering it up.\n\n497\n00:24:06.598 --> 00:24:08.848\nBut down at the bottom there\nis a little save button.\n\n498\n00:24:08.848 --> 00:24:11.618\nAnd it's important to pay attention to\nthat because if you don't hit save and\n\n499\n00:24:11.618 --> 00:24:13.415\nyou navigate away,\nthe group disappears right?\n\n500\n00:24:13.415 --> 00:24:16.924\nSo I need to hit Save to save it and\nnow I've got a Student Machines group.\n\n501\n00:24:16.924 --> 00:24:22.154\nAnd I can add another one which I'll\ncall Teacher Machines, all right?\n\n502\n00:24:22.154 --> 00:24:24.230\nAnd so I'll go ahead and save that.\n\n503\n00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:27.970\nAnd then I might wanna create something\na little more generic, like Laptops.\n\n504\n00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:33.100\nAnd I'll save that, and\ndesktops, maybe I've got\n\n505\n00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:39.600\na power profile that I want to apply to\nlaptops that's different than desktops.\n\n506\n00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.680\nSo I need separate groups for those.\n\n507\n00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:46.000\nI might have a laptop that is\na student machine and it's a laptop.\n\n508\n00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.520\nI might have another machine that's\na teacher machine and a laptop.\n\n509\n00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.810\nBut I have a common profile that\nI want to apply to all laptops.\n\n510\n00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:55.250\nNow I've got that flexibility.\n\n511\n00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.820\nYou gotta create the groups that\nmeet the need for your organization.\n\n512\n00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.250\nThink about how you're going\nto roll your policies out and\n\n513\n00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:03.620\ncreate the groups that match up\nwith what you're going to do.\n\n514\n00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.590\nAnd it's easy enough to come and\nchange these later and\n\n515\n00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:07.840\nkind of move things around,\nyou've got that flexibility.\n\n516\n00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.891\nAll right, once I've got these groups set\nup though, the groups are kind of empty.\n\n517\n00:25:12.891 --> 00:25:17.061\nAnd so you've gotta come through and\nadd people into the groups, right.\n\n518\n00:25:17.061 --> 00:25:21.504\nAnd when you take a look at the groups, so\nlike I've got Desktops chosen right here,\n\n519\n00:25:21.504 --> 00:25:25.270\nand over here I'm gonna see in\ndevice groups not in any groups.\n\n520\n00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.280\nYou can actually nest groups.\n\n521\n00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:37.070\nSo I might wanna create a Teacher Laptops\nand a Teacher Desktops, right?\n\n522\n00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:44.000\nNow, I might want all of those to\nbe inside of the Teacher Machines.\n\n523\n00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.710\nSo a profile applied to\nTeacher Machines would apply to\n\n524\n00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:53.040\nevery Teacher Machine, versus just\nTeacher Laptops or Teacher Desktops.\n\n525\n00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:58.831\nNow, what if I want Wes's machine to be\na Teacher Laptop and a Teacher Machine?\n\n526\n00:25:58.831 --> 00:26:00.090\nI don't have to put it in both.\n\n527\n00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:01.260\nI can nest them.\n\n528\n00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.970\nSo that Teacher Laptops\nare inside of Teacher Machines.\n\n529\n00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:05.460\nYou can kind of create that environment.\n\n530\n00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:12.320\nSo I might take Teacher Laptops and edit\nthat to add it into another device group.\n\n531\n00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:17.089\nSo when you do that, you can come in and\nyou can take Teacher Machines,\n\n532\n00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.430\nand then over here you've got\nthe little plus at the bottom, and\n\n533\n00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:27.080\nyou can add devices to the group and\nyou can add device groups to the group.\n\n534\n00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:32.500\nAnd so I might choose to come in here and\nadd Teacher Desktops and Teacher Laptops.\n\n535\n00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:38.510\nAnd now, Teacher Machines contains\nTeacher Desktops and Laptops.\n\n536\n00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.810\nSo if I just put Wes's\nmachine in Teacher Laptops,\n\n537\n00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.770\nit'll now be in Teacher Machines also.\n\n538\n00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:47.070\nSo again, you're building that\nhierarchy to meet the needs of your\n\n539\n00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.630\norganization, all right?\n\n540\n00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.690\nThat's important.\n\n541\n00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:51.590\nI'll say, I'm just gonna make Wes, shoot!\n\n542\n00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:52.920\nI forgot to hit Save.\n\n543\n00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.482\nAnd so\nhere's that warning I told you guys about.\n\n544\n00:26:55.482 --> 00:26:57.370\nI warn you guys about it and\nthen I forget to do it myself.\n\n545\n00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:59.510\nSo I just need to make\nsure that I save that.\n\n546\n00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:02.490\nAll right, but I'm gonna take Wes,\nI'm just gonna make him a Student Machine.\n\n547\n00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.510\nSo I'm going to go here\nto Student Machines and\n\n548\n00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:08.240\nI'll hit that little plus sign and instead\nof adding a group I'm gonna add a device.\n\n549\n00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.642\nSo I'm gonna add a device and\nI'll choose, you know what?\n\n550\n00:27:10.642 --> 00:27:12.370\nI never enrolled your machine Wes,\nso I'll just do mine.\n\n551\n00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:16.520\nSo I'm gonna take Don's Mac and I'm gonna\nadd that in to Student Machines, okay?\n\n552\n00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.470\nSo I'll see this change to show\none member as soon as I hit Save.\n\n553\n00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:21.570\nThere we go.\n\n554\n00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.410\nSo Student Machines now has one member,\nDon's Mac.\n\n555\n00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:27.950\nTeacher Machines has two members, those\ngroups, and if we started drilling down on\n\n556\n00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:31.640\nthe groups, you can add more and\nit starts to populate that up.\n\n557\n00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.230\nSo under Teacher Laptops maybe\nI wanna add my machine there,\n\n558\n00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.130\nbecause you can have a device\nin more than one group.\n\n559\n00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:37.930\nThere's no reason you couldn't.\n\n560\n00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.364\nAnd so I can add that one in, right?\n\n561\n00:27:40.364 --> 00:27:44.080\nAnd so now I'll show up under that also,\nright?\n\n562\n00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:48.190\nNotice how Teacher Machines,\nits member count didn't increase, but\n\n563\n00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:50.280\nbecause I'm in Teacher Laptops, and\n\n564\n00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.950\nTeacher Laptops is in Teacher Machines,\nI'm now effectively in Teacher Machines.\n\n565\n00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:55.770\nIt's an easier way to manage that,\nall right.\n\n566\n00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.580\nBut you've got to arrange and depending on\nyour devices, depending on your groups,\n\n567\n00:27:58.580 --> 00:27:59.960\nit's gonna be different for you.\n\n568\n00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.398\nCreate the hierarchy based on\nthe policies you're going to apply.\n\n569\n00:28:03.398 --> 00:28:06.632\nAnd just remember, it's easy enough to\nmove people around after the fact, so\n\n570\n00:28:06.632 --> 00:28:09.425\nif you screw it up, it's just gonna\nbe a little bit more pointing and\n\n571\n00:28:09.425 --> 00:28:12.270\nclicking to get it straightened out,\nbut you can straighten it out.\n\n572\n00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:16.860\nAll right, once I've got that kind of\nstructured, I've got my groups created,\n\n573\n00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:21.535\nI've got my devices enrolled, now it's\ntime to start working with our settings.\n\n574\n00:28:21.535 --> 00:28:24.020\nAnd remember you've already\ngot some settings in place.\n\n575\n00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.870\nThat when we go into our devices and\ndevice groups and\n\n576\n00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:31.480\nstuff, well, that's all fine and good.\n\n577\n00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:37.090\nBut we have the all settings profile\nthat really just applies to every single\n\n578\n00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:42.120\nperson that's out there, and is what's\nreally affecting our systems and machines.\n\n579\n00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:46.170\nAnd so when I go under Groups,\nand I go under Everyone,\n\n580\n00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:50.530\nthis is applying literally to everyone,\nbut notice how it's a group.\n\n581\n00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:51.620\nIt's a user group.\n\n582\n00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.060\nIt's applying to every user.\n\n583\n00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.580\nSo if I have a user account,\nit doesn't matter what machine I log into.\n\n584\n00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:58.390\nThis is going to apply.\n\n585\n00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:01.040\nWhen we start to create our settings,\nyou've gotta figure out,\n\n586\n00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:06.860\ndo you want them to apply to a user or do\nyou want to apply them to a device, right?\n\n587\n00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:12.510\nI might want something that's\na laptop power saving setting.\n\n588\n00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:14.620\nI want that to apply to laptop\nregardless of who logins.\n\n589\n00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.390\nI don't care if you're a teacher or\na student,\n\n590\n00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:17.750\nI want it to apply to that laptop.\n\n591\n00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:23.550\nOr I might have something that I just want\nto apply to students, not to teachers.\n\n592\n00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:25.720\nNow I don't care if the student\nlogs in on a desktop or\n\n593\n00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.200\na laptop,\nI just care that they're a student.\n\n594\n00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:33.290\nSo some profiles will apply to users,\nsome profiles will apply to devices,\n\n595\n00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:38.220\nand then we make the decision, but\nI always apply the profiles to a group.\n\n596\n00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.760\nI rarely apply a profile\nto an individual user,\n\n597\n00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.370\nbecause there's no easy way to copy that.\n\n598\n00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.960\nIf I create a profile and I just apply it\nto Wes, and then I hire a new user and I'm\n\n599\n00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.940\nlike, I want them to have the same profile\nas Wes, there's no easy way to copy that.\n\n600\n00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:55.490\nBut if I created a group instead,\na group called ITProTV show hosts, and\n\n601\n00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.840\nput Wes in that and\ncreated the profile there.\n\n602\n00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.850\nAnd now I want somebody else\nto have that same profile?\n\n603\n00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:03.130\nI just stick them in\nthe ITProTV show host group and\n\n604\n00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:04.430\nnow they get the same profile as Wes.\n\n605\n00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:10.290\nSo there's times where you might wanna\ndeviate, but as a rule of thumb,\n\n606\n00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:14.070\nalways apply your profiles to a group,\ncuz that gives you the most flexibility.\n\n607\n00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:16.420\nYou can move people in and\ntake people out of the group.\n\n608\n00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:19.900\nYou can move devices in,\nyou can take devices out of the group and\n\n609\n00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.480\nyou can get that flexibility.\n\n610\n00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.500\n>> Now Don, I know that we have more\nto go with the Profile Manager and\n\n611\n00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.730\nconfiguration profiles.\n\n612\n00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:29.000\nBut I'm looking at the clock here and\nit looks like we're, as always,\n\n613\n00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.650\nflexing the muscles of the clock here, but\nlooks like we'll have to come back for\n\n614\n00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:33.670\na part three on this.\n\n615\n00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.613\nBut before we do, got any parting words?\n\n616\n00:30:35.613 --> 00:30:36.904\n>> It's kind of sad, Wes, I said,\n\n617\n00:30:36.904 --> 00:30:40.250\nin this episode we're actually gonna\nsee the Profile Manager do something.\n\n618\n00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:42.720\nWe still haven't technically done\nanything with the darn thing.\n\n619\n00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.480\nWe got a client enrolled, and so\n\n620\n00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.040\nwe're right at the point where\nnow we can do something.\n\n621\n00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.140\nSo in part three,\nwe're gonna create some settings.\n\n622\n00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:53.560\nI promise, scout's honor or however many\nfingers you have to hold up for that,\n\n623\n00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.900\nso we're gonna create some settings.\n\n624\n00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:57.510\nWe'll apply them.\nWe'll push them out to that client.\n\n625\n00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:59.460\nWe'll see it actually do something.\n\n626\n00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:00.804\nBut we've got all\nthe infrastructure set up.\n\n627\n00:31:00.804 --> 00:31:03.200\nIn the first episode we\nsaw setting up the server.\n\n628\n00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.890\nNow we saw enrolling the clients.\n\n629\n00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:06.860\nWe've got our basic infrastructure set up.\n\n630\n00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:07.840\nNow it's time to work with the profiles.\n\n631\n00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:08.835\nSo definitely stay tuned for part three.\n\n632\n00:31:08.835 --> 00:31:10.170\n>> Well, that's great.\n\n633\n00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:11.807\nWe will hold him to his word.\n\n634\n00:31:11.807 --> 00:31:15.230\nIn part three, we will actually\nsee configuration profiles.\n\n635\n00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:18.300\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\ntake the time to sign out here at ITProTV.\n\n636\n00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.590\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n637\n00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:20.440\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n638\n00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.889\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n639\n00:31:22.889 --> 00:31:29.066\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.876\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we're coming back at you with more\n\n4\n00:00:19.876 --> 00:00:21.650\nof our OS X server essentials.\n\n5\n00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.030\nAnd I know what you might be thinking.\n\n6\n00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.930\nThis is configuration\nprofiles the trilogy, right?\n\n7\n00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.716\nIt's kind of like one of those trilogies\nwhere you just really wanted to see them\n\n8\n00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:32.499\nturn Anakin into Darth Vader,\njust get to the point here.\n\n9\n00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:33.724\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Well,\n\n10\n00:00:33.724 --> 00:00:35.660\nwe're back with configuration profiles,\n\n11\n00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.390\nand joining me in the studio with\nthat topic is Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n12\n00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.535\nDon, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n13\n00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:41.117\n>> Doing great, Wes.\nSo it's, what is it,\n\n14\n00:00:41.117 --> 00:00:42.470\nreturn of the profile?\n\n15\n00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.144\n>> Yes.\n\n16\n00:00:43.144 --> 00:00:44.465\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, well,\n\n17\n00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:47.993\nwe're gonna dive right back in, and\nup until this point, if you didn't watch\n\n18\n00:00:47.993 --> 00:00:52.140\nepisodes one and two, episode one, we saw\nhow to set up the Profile Manager server.\n\n19\n00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.540\nEpisode two,\nwe saw enrolling the clients and\n\n20\n00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.720\nstarting to set up our groups\nin the Profile Manager itself.\n\n21\n00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.642\nSo here in episode 3,\n\n22\n00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:01.930\nnow we get to do the fun stuff,\nwhich is to mess with the clients, right?\n\n23\n00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.550\nSo the whole point of the Profile Manager\nis that we can create settings in\n\n24\n00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.310\na central database, and they can be\npushed out to one, ten, a hundred,\n\n25\n00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.260\na thousand machines with\nthe click of a button, right?\n\n26\n00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.060\nAnd so that's what we're gonna do\nright here is we're gonna start to\n\n27\n00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.025\npush those settings.\n\n28\n00:01:15.025 --> 00:01:18.075\nNow, key thing if you didn't\nwatch the last episode.\n\n29\n00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:20.400\nBefore you dive in and\nstart working with settings is,\n\n30\n00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.785\nyou're probably going to\nneed to create some groups.\n\n31\n00:01:22.785 --> 00:01:24.515\nBy default, there's only one profile.\n\n32\n00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:27.556\nAnd that profile applies to everyone,\nright.\n\n33\n00:01:27.556 --> 00:01:32.222\nSo if I go in to my Profile Manager, so\nI'm here in the Profile Manager, and\n\n34\n00:01:32.222 --> 00:01:36.860\nyou go in to groups,\nyou'll have an Everyone group by default.\n\n35\n00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.910\nAnd the Everyone group has settings.\n\n36\n00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.820\nAnd so I can see the various\nsettings that are tied to it.\n\n37\n00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.470\nMost of these are just restrictions.\n\n38\n00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.010\nWhat are we allowed to do?\n\n39\n00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.230\nWe allow access to the My Devices Portal.\n\n40\n00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.880\nWe allow device lock, device wipe,\npasscodes to be cleared, and so on.\n\n41\n00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.690\nThese are settings that kin dof\npertain to the security of the device.\n\n42\n00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.620\nBut the real settings that\nwe want are right here.\n\n43\n00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.810\nWhen we go into that settings tab,\nwe'll see that there's\n\n44\n00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.630\nsome general settings identification,\nOS X server accounts that are in place.\n\n45\n00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.870\nAnd these are what's going to\nbe affecting these clients and\n\n46\n00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.790\naffecting everybody on our network.\n\n47\n00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.840\nSo what are these?\n\n48\n00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.380\nWell, General.\n\n49\n00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.200\nGeneral actually just has basic settings\nin it that apply to the general machine.\n\n50\n00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.080\nWell see those in a minute.\n\n51\n00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.630\nThere's really not anything to crazy or\nfancy there.\n\n52\n00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.890\nIdentification, that's how we exchange\nthe client's information with our server,\n\n53\n00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.300\nthe whole certificate infrastructure,\nthat's what's being shown there.\n\n54\n00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.430\nAnd then OS X Server accounts.\n\n55\n00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.140\nWell, if my Profile Manager\nis running on a server,\n\n56\n00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.860\nthat is also a messages server or\ncalendar, contact server or mail server.\n\n57\n00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.710\nThen the client will automatically\nconfigure itself to use that messages\n\n58\n00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.000\nserver or to use that mail server, and\nso when someone fires up the Mail app,\n\n59\n00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000\nit's already set up.\n\n60\n00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.508\nWhen they fire up the Messages app,\nit's already configured and\n\n61\n00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:56.794\nthey're ready to work, right.\n\n62\n00:02:56.794 --> 00:02:58.440\nThat setting is on by default.\n\n63\n00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.070\nWe can tweak that if we want.\n\n64\n00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.020\nBut it's on by default, all right.\n\n65\n00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.850\nNow, for most of the cases I usually\ndon't mess with this Everyone profile.\n\n66\n00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.900\nThe Everyone profile applies to everyone,\nadministrators, regular users,\n\n67\n00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.510\nlaptops, desktops, everybody.\n\n68\n00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.180\nI don't really mess with it.\n\n69\n00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.140\nIf I have a company-wide policy that\ndictates a certain setting that affects\n\n70\n00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.280\nevery user in the entire company,\nthen yes, we'll do it right here.\n\n71\n00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.620\nThis affects everybody.\n\n72\n00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.590\nBut typically we don't have that.\n\n73\n00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.465\nTypically we have different needs for\ndifferent people.\n\n74\n00:03:30.465 --> 00:03:32.735\nAnd so\nwe create groups based on those needs.\n\n75\n00:03:32.735 --> 00:03:37.785\nSo one of the examples that I kept\ngiving was a laptop power policy.\n\n76\n00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:41.035\nSo I might have power settings that\nI wanna apply just to laptops.\n\n77\n00:03:41.035 --> 00:03:42.765\nSo I'm gonna go to my device groups.\n\n78\n00:03:42.765 --> 00:03:46.280\nNow, It's not gonna be a user group,\ncuz I don't care who the user is.\n\n79\n00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.530\nI don't care if it's a teacher,\nor a student, if it's Wes,\n\n80\n00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.120\nif it's me, I want this to apply\nto laptops, so it's a device.\n\n81\n00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.560\nAnd under Devices, well, I have\nTeacher Laptops, I have Student Machines.\n\n82\n00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.780\nI didn't divide students up, so I probably\nneed to divide that up a little better.\n\n83\n00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.910\nSo I might have Student Laptops and\nI might have Student Desktops, right?\n\n84\n00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.520\nSo I'm just gonna add these two\nextra groups into my group list.\n\n85\n00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.818\nAnd so now under Laptops, I can add\nall the other groups that are laptops.\n\n86\n00:04:18.818 --> 00:04:21.870\nSo I can coming here and\nsay I wanna add groups, and\n\n87\n00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.330\nI'm gonna add Student Laptops and\nTeacher Laptops to that group.\n\n88\n00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.270\nSo now if I apply a policy\nto the Laptops group,\n\n89\n00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.730\nit will affect Student Laptops and\nTeacher Laptops.\n\n90\n00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.650\nIf I add any other types of laptops in the\nfuture like Administrative Staff Laptops\n\n91\n00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.510\nor something like that,\nI would just add them into the same group.\n\n92\n00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.140\nAnd now I can create a policy that's\ngoing to affect every laptop.\n\n93\n00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.550\nNot just students, not just teachers.\n\n94\n00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.600\nI don't have to do it twice.\n\n95\n00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.960\nI can go to one place and\nit affects every laptop.\n\n96\n00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.400\nSo, if you didn't catch episode two,\ncheck that one out because you need to\n\n97\n00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.040\nplan your groups based on your polices,\nall right.\n\n98\n00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.840\nSo if I want to create that laptop\npolicy for power management, well,\n\n99\n00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.000\nnow I've got a laptop group that I can\nuse and I can go to the settings for it.\n\n100\n00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.330\nAnd in the settings,\nall I'm gonna see is General right now.\n\n101\n00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.850\nAnd General's technically empty.\n\n102\n00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.580\nThere's one entry in there\nthat says this policy exists.\n\n103\n00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.560\nSo that's really all that's there.\n\n104\n00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.540\nSo it's technically\nan empty profile right now.\n\n105\n00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.344\nIt just doesn't have\nany crazy settings for\n\n106\n00:05:24.344 --> 00:05:29.610\nme, and I need to go and edit that\nprofile, and now is where the fun starts.\n\n107\n00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.530\nThis is the edit screen for the profile,\n\n108\n00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.070\nand here's where I can jump in and\nactually start to see the settings and\n\n109\n00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.880\nget things configured and\nreally start to work with it.\n\n110\n00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.740\nNow, let's start over here on the left.\n\n111\n00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.380\nWhat you've got here is\na list of categories.\n\n112\n00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.720\nNot settings, categories.\n\n113\n00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.716\nEach one of these buttons might\nrepresent only one setting, or\n\n114\n00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:50.817\nit might represent 30 settings, right.\n\n115\n00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:54.480\nSo these are all just kind of divided\nup based on what we want to do.\n\n116\n00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.380\nAnd the first section is called OS X and\niOS, right?\n\n117\n00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.280\nThese are settings that are common for\nmachines that are running Mac OS and\n\n118\n00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.610\nmachines that are running\nthe mobile platform, iOS.\n\n119\n00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.710\nSo any setting in this category\ncould apply to a Macbook,\n\n120\n00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:17.480\na iMac, a Mac Mini, they could\nalso apply to an iPhone and iPad.\n\n121\n00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.690\nSo these will cover the gamut,\nright, all those different areas.\n\n122\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:21.720\nAnd so as you look down,\n\n123\n00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.360\nthese are gonna be really general things,\nlike password policies, right?\n\n124\n00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.650\nNetwork configurations, VPNs,\nyou have VPNs on all those devices so\n\n125\n00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.760\nwe can define the VPNs right here.\n\n126\n00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.010\nCertificates that we trust,\nwe've kind of seen that already.\n\n127\n00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.310\nThe security controls to be able\nto remote wipe and remote lock.\n\n128\n00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.310\nWe saw those in our Everyone settings.\n\n129\n00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.430\nSo these are things that are very,\nvery common.\n\n130\n00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.450\nThen you'll see sections that\nare a little more specific.\n\n131\n00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.330\nHere's settings that only\napply to iOS devices.\n\n132\n00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:56.040\nSo if I define a setting in here,\nlike Single App Mode, Single App Mode\n\n133\n00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.350\ndoesn't do anything on a MacBook or\na Mac Pro.\n\n134\n00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.087\nBut on an iPad, I gave an example in\nthe last episode about some people have\n\n135\n00:07:04.087 --> 00:07:07.848\na point of sales application, like\na cash register that runs on the iPad.\n\n136\n00:07:07.848 --> 00:07:09.798\nAnd if that's the only\nthing you want it to do,\n\n137\n00:07:09.798 --> 00:07:13.110\nyou can put it in single app mode and\nspecify, here's that cash register app.\n\n138\n00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.940\nSo when you turn on that iPad,\nit goes right to the cash register.\n\n139\n00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.292\nAnd if somebody closes the cash register,\nit goes right back to it again, right.\n\n140\n00:07:19.292 --> 00:07:20.180\nIt's a single app.\n\n141\n00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.620\nThat's it.\nYou have one app and\n\n142\n00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.430\nthat's all you can run.\n\n143\n00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.110\nSo you've created a kiosk\nout of your iPad.\n\n144\n00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.070\nYou can't do that easily\nwith a Mac OS machine.\n\n145\n00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:33.170\nSo these are settings that\nonly apply to iOS devices.\n\n146\n00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.350\nNow I called my device group Laptops, but\n\n147\n00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.630\nit doesn't actually know what's\na laptop and what isn't.\n\n148\n00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.190\nIt's all based on me,\nI put stuff in the groups.\n\n149\n00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.810\nSo I can put an iPad in the Laptops group,\nand\n\n150\n00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.010\nif I have settings here they would apply,\nright?\n\n151\n00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.750\nBut since this is really for MacBooks and\n\n152\n00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.870\nMacBook Pros,\nI'm gonna ignore this section.\n\n153\n00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.548\nThere's nothing in here\nthat's really gonna pertain.\n\n154\n00:07:53.548 --> 00:07:58.761\nSo if I keep scrolling down,\nI'll get to another section called OS X.\n\n155\n00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:02.128\nAnd here's the OS X settings\nthat don't apply to iOS.\n\n156\n00:08:02.128 --> 00:08:03.742\nThey'd just apply to OS X.\n\n157\n00:08:03.742 --> 00:08:06.645\nFor example, if I have a directory.\n\n158\n00:08:06.645 --> 00:08:11.057\nI mentioned in the last episode,\nan iPad can't bind to your Open Directory.\n\n159\n00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:13.680\nBut an OS X machine can, right.\n\n160\n00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.870\nSo I could choose Directory and I could\ncome in here and specify what I want.\n\n161\n00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.090\nAnd I could say,\nI want to configure the directory, and\n\n162\n00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.730\nI can specify what I'm\ngoing to connect to,\n\n163\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.860\nis it a Microsoft Active Directory or\nan Open Directory for Apple.\n\n164\n00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.792\nI'll choose that one.\n\n165\n00:08:27.792 --> 00:08:29.075\nWho's the server, right?\n\n166\n00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:32.419\nWell, my server is osx-server01.\n\n167\n00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:35.175\nAnd then I need an admin to\nbe able to join to it, and so\n\n168\n00:08:35.175 --> 00:08:36.570\nI can specify my account.\n\n169\n00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.650\nAnd a client ID if I want to provide one,\notherwise it'll generate one for me, and\n\n170\n00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.390\nthat's what I'll leave it at.\n\n171\n00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.490\nAnd I can say OK.\n\n172\n00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:49.360\nSo now I've got directory\nsettings inside of my profile.\n\n173\n00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.410\nI've got General,\nwhich I didn't change anything on, and\n\n174\n00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.140\nI've got directory settings.\n\n175\n00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.610\nSo let me go back into my edit screen.\n\n176\n00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:00.870\nAnd we can look through here and\nkeep finding more settings like that.\n\n177\n00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.175\nAnd there's a ton of settings in here.\n\n178\n00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:05.990\nIf you're ever bored, go through and\nkinda browse through it.\n\n179\n00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:07.980\nWe'll highlight a few of\nthem here in this episode.\n\n180\n00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.280\nBut what I wanted to point out is, see\nhow AD Certificate says Not Configured?\n\n181\n00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.780\nBut Directory now says\n1 Payload configured.\n\n182\n00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.290\nSo now that's a payload,\nthat's a part of this profile.\n\n183\n00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.180\nThis profile now has some contents, right.\n\n184\n00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.320\nBefore, when it just said general,\nthere really wasn't anything in there,\n\n185\n00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.370\nexcept for\nthe fact that the profile existed.\n\n186\n00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.730\nNow the profile has\nconfiguration settings and\n\n187\n00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.510\nit has a payload to carry along with it.\n\n188\n00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.045\nAnd so all this stuff,\nas I start to configure it, is going to\n\n189\n00:09:34.045 --> 00:09:37.860\naffect my machine, and it's gonna come\nalong with it as part of that payload.\n\n190\n00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.370\nFor the log in window, right, if I want to\nconfigure that, I can specify whether we\n\n191\n00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.160\nwant to show additional information in the\nmenu bar, whether we want a banner, right?\n\n192\n00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.831\nA lot of places have other\ninformation they want to display,\n\n193\n00:09:51.831 --> 00:09:56.399\nlike, this machine is for\nauthorized use only.\n\n194\n00:09:56.399 --> 00:10:02.380\nUnauthorized use is forbidden, right.\n\n195\n00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.464\nThese are the dumb disclaimers that people\nsee, and like, why do they even do that?\n\n196\n00:10:05.464 --> 00:10:09.094\nAnd the reason is, it's called due\ndiligence, right, that if somebody uses\n\n197\n00:10:09.094 --> 00:10:13.054\nyour machine inappropriately and you take\nthem to court, the courts can say, well,\n\n198\n00:10:13.054 --> 00:10:15.034\nyou left the machine\nout there in the open,\n\n199\n00:10:15.034 --> 00:10:17.435\nthey thought it was there for their use.\n\n200\n00:10:17.435 --> 00:10:20.770\nBut if you have a dumb little message\nin here, that's your due diligence.\n\n201\n00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.570\nYou can say, well, it said right on the\nscreen they weren't allowed to use it and\n\n202\n00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.540\nthey used it anyway, right.\n\n203\n00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.260\nThat's kind of required.\n\n204\n00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.650\nThat's why these little banners exist,\nso I can punch that in there.\n\n205\n00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.470\nWe can change the way the login prompt\nis displayed, do we want to list users?\n\n206\n00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.070\nIf we do, do we want to show local users,\nmobile accounts,\n\n207\n00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.130\ndo we want to show network users?\n\n208\n00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.640\nRight?\n\n209\n00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.490\nNormally, you don't see network users,\ncuz you might have thousands of them, but\n\n210\n00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:42.750\nwe could say, you know what,\nlet's go ahead and do it.\n\n211\n00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.180\nShow those network users.\n\n212\n00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.740\nAnd so you can start to specify\nhow you want that to be.\n\n213\n00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.710\nDo you want to show the Sleep, Restart,\nand Shut Down buttons on the login screen?\n\n214\n00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:55.431\nOr do you want to force them to log in in\norder to do Sleep, Restart, or Shut Down.\n\n215\n00:10:55.431 --> 00:10:59.873\nOn a normal Mac, you see those buttons,\nbut once you've bound to a directory,\n\n216\n00:10:59.873 --> 00:11:00.679\nthey go away.\n\n217\n00:11:00.679 --> 00:11:02.330\nI can make it where they\nshow back up again.\n\n218\n00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.600\nAnd now we'll see them even\nthough we haven't logged in.\n\n219\n00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.570\nSo you can start to specify these things.\n\n220\n00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.180\nYou've got other options buried in here.\n\n221\n00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.670\nEach of these as I start to customize them\n\n222\n00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.680\nis changing the behavior of that machine,\nright?\n\n223\n00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.640\nAnd there are tons and\ntons of settings in here.\n\n224\n00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.750\nNow, as I modify it, it's just\ngonna say one payload configured.\n\n225\n00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.460\nI changed more than one option, but\n\n226\n00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.540\nthe payload is considered\nthe login window payload.\n\n227\n00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.920\nAnd the directory is its own payload.\n\n228\n00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.760\nSo I have two payloads configured total,\nright.\n\n229\n00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.847\nAnd as we keep going through, you'll\njust see tons of different settings.\n\n230\n00:11:33.847 --> 00:11:36.230\nSoftware Update's a real popular one.\n\n231\n00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.950\nIf I have a software update server set up,\n\n232\n00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.640\nhow does the machine know to\nuse my software update server?\n\n233\n00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.997\nWell, I've got to go and\nconfigure it and give it a URL.\n\n234\n00:11:44.997 --> 00:11:48.721\nAnd so you would specify in here,\n\n235\n00:11:48.721 --> 00:11:53.509\nhttp:// followed by your server name on\n\n236\n00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:57.769\nport 8088 /index.sucatalog.\n\n237\n00:11:57.769 --> 00:12:00.910\nSo you would point it to your\nown software update server.\n\n238\n00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.610\nAnd I'm gonna turn off beta installs,\nI don't want that, but\n\n239\n00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:05.120\nI do want to stay up to date.\n\n240\n00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.590\nAnd now, any machine that this profile\napplies to will get my software update.\n\n241\n00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.270\nI might want to apply that to everyone,\nright.\n\n242\n00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.809\nBut here I'm just doing it to my laptops.\n\n243\n00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:18.920\nUnder Printing, we can add printers and\nget them in place.\n\n244\n00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.140\nEnergy Saver, that's the one I was\nlooking for in the first place.\n\n245\n00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.270\nThese are laptops.\n\n246\n00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.730\nI probably wanna be aggressive with\nmy power profiles on a laptop.\n\n247\n00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.350\nOn my desktop,\nI probably want to be less aggressive.\n\n248\n00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.900\nAnd so\nI can create separate profiles for that.\n\n249\n00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.970\nSo here this one is\njust affecting laptops.\n\n250\n00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.980\nSo now when I go to configure that,\nI can specify things like,\n\n251\n00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.080\nput the computer to\nsleep after ten minutes.\n\n252\n00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.720\nOn a desktop,\nthat'd probably be pretty annoying.\n\n253\n00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.440\nBut on a laptop,\nthat's actually a decent amount of time.\n\n254\n00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.010\nIf you haven't used it in ten minutes,\ngo to sleep.\n\n255\n00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.260\nThat way you can get a long battery life.\n\n256\n00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.240\nPut the display to sleep\nafter five minutes.\n\n257\n00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.545\nWell, maybe I wanna go a little longer\nthan that, so maybe I go 20 minutes for\n\n258\n00:12:54.545 --> 00:12:58.230\nsleep and 10 minutes for\ndisplay sleep, so I can adjust those.\n\n259\n00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.230\nPut the hard drives to sleep,\nwake on Ethernet activity,\n\n260\n00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.660\nthose kind of things we\ncan start to adjust.\n\n261\n00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.912\nYou can even set whether this\napplies to battery or on power.\n\n262\n00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:11.600\nWhen somebody's on power, maybe I don't\nwant him to go to sleep that fast, so\n\n263\n00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.500\nI'll go an hour.\n\n264\n00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.150\nIf you're plugged into a wall plug,\ndon't go to sleep right away.\n\n265\n00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.730\nMaybe we set that screen\ntimeout to 20 minutes.\n\n266\n00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.680\nBut when we're on battery,\nI want it to be aggressive.\n\n267\n00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.630\nSo now I can be specific there.\n\n268\n00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:23.960\nAnd you can set a schedule.\n\n269\n00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.840\nI don't normally use\na schedule on a desktop.\n\n270\n00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.260\nBut on a laptop I do.\n\n271\n00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.410\nWait, I got that backwards.\n\n272\n00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.070\nI don't really use a schedule on a laptop.\n\n273\n00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.490\nOn a desktop, I do.\n\n274\n00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:36.230\nSo during the workday from 8 AM to 5 PM,\nI want that machine to stay on.\n\n275\n00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:40.460\nBut after 5 PM, get it to go to sleep,\nthat way it's not sitting there eating up\n\n276\n00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.400\nelectricity overnight\nwhen nobody's using it.\n\n277\n00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.980\nSo you can come in and specify when\nyou want to start the computer up and\n\n278\n00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.660\nwhen you want it to go to sleep.\n\n279\n00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.290\n>> Don, I noticed that in\nthe configurations there,\n\n280\n00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:52.760\nyou had a network option.\n\n281\n00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.930\nNow, this is probably a two part question.\n\n282\n00:13:55.930 --> 00:14:00.150\nCan we configure some of those options\nthrough some of the standard DHCP options?\n\n283\n00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:04.560\nAnd if we can, what would be the benefit\nof maybe using the configuration profile?\n\n284\n00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.370\n>> So none of this can really\nbe done via DHCP options.\n\n285\n00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.820\nDHCP options will help you find\na server in some cases, but\n\n286\n00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.560\nhere we've got Bonjour, we've got Apple\nPush Notifications, you've got all these\n\n287\n00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.550\nother things that take effect, so you\nreally don't mess with DHCP on this one.\n\n288\n00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.700\nAnd so you go through, you configure all\nyour settings, and the client's gonna find\n\n289\n00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.140\nit thinks that device enrollment\nhas already occurred at this point.\n\n290\n00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.680\nSo the network settings, do you see those?\n\n291\n00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.290\nNot under Power,\nyou saw those back up top.\n\n292\n00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:35.060\nLet's jump back up to those, cuz what\nyou're going to see in there is things\n\n293\n00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.930\ntied more towards like identification.\n\n294\n00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:44.380\nSo if I jump under Network and\nbrowse in there, you can set what SSIDs.\n\n295\n00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:48.025\nSo if I want to pre-populate a wireless\nnetwork, whether you want to Auto Join it.\n\n296\n00:14:48.025 --> 00:14:52.920\nSo maybe I want it to automatically\nconnect to the ITProTV\n\n297\n00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.330\nwireless network that we have\nhere in the studio, right.\n\n298\n00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.080\nWe can set it to Auto Join, and\n\n299\n00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.990\nthen you can specify the security type,\nthat one's WPA2 Personal,\n\n300\n00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:07.400\n,and then we can specify that password,\nif I can remember it.\n\n301\n00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.970\nDo I know what the password\nis to our wireless?\n\n302\n00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:09.610\nI think that's it.\n\n303\n00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:13.190\nSo I can specify that, and now when\nthis profile applies to the laptop,\n\n304\n00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:17.025\nit'll already have the wireless network\nand it'll already have the SSID.\n\n305\n00:15:17.025 --> 00:15:19.430\nIt'll connect right up, and it'll go.\n\n306\n00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.060\nThese are the network settings.\n\n307\n00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.140\nAnd I did a WiFi, but\nyou can drop that down and\n\n308\n00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:28.430\nyou'll see where you can set other things\nlike Ethernet, Passpoint, and so on.\n\n309\n00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:33.390\nNotice how Ethernet, it says OS X only,\neven though I'm in the iOS and\n\n310\n00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:34.615\nOS X section.\n\n311\n00:15:34.615 --> 00:15:35.925\nWhy is that?\n\n312\n00:15:35.925 --> 00:15:38.925\nWell, I don't know of any iPhones that\nhave an Ethernet jack on them, and\n\n313\n00:15:38.925 --> 00:15:41.055\nI don't know any iPads that have\nan Ethernet jack on them either,\n\n314\n00:15:41.055 --> 00:15:42.365\nbut they've all got wireless, right?\n\n315\n00:15:42.365 --> 00:15:45.679\nSo this is a common setting thanks to\nwireless, and so we can put that in.\n\n316\n00:15:45.679 --> 00:15:46.705\nAll right?\n\n317\n00:15:46.705 --> 00:15:51.461\nBut nothing there really kinda pertaining\nto DHCP, and the main reason is,\n\n318\n00:15:51.461 --> 00:15:55.695\nif your computer's just firing up\nIf you don't have an IP address,\n\n319\n00:15:55.695 --> 00:15:58.140\nyou can't talk to the server.\n\n320\n00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.130\nAnd if you already have an IP address,\nit's too late to modify options, and so\n\n321\n00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:02.330\nit is kind of a matter of timing.\n\n322\n00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.270\nAll right, some of the other\nthings that we can see in here.\n\n323\n00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.450\nSo I did the power which is\nwhat I actually set out for,\n\n324\n00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.620\nbut let's just kinda take a look at a few\nother settings cuz they can be kinda fun.\n\n325\n00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.530\nParental Controls, that's always\na good time, you can configure those.\n\n326\n00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.160\nTime Machine, we can get Time Machine\nbackup setup and scheduled.\n\n327\n00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.300\nThis is a little trickier because if\nyou're backing up to an external drive\n\n328\n00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.740\nhow do you know what that\nexternal drive's gonna be called?\n\n329\n00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.110\nBut where this is really handy is if\nyou have a network Time Machine server.\n\n330\n00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.880\nSo if I have a network Time Machine\nserver setup I can come in here and\n\n331\n00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.030\nI can specify that server.\n\n332\n00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:39.000\nI don't have one, so I'll just make one\nup, and so I can specify the server.\n\n333\n00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.590\nAnd now, these machines will\nautomatically configure Time Machine and\n\n334\n00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:45.250\nthey'll automatically\nback up to that server.\n\n335\n00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.370\nI could have thousands of machines, and\n\n336\n00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.960\nit's all gonna happen automatically,\nright?\n\n337\n00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.730\nAnd so I can tell it what I wanna back up,\nif I just wanna do the startup volume or\n\n338\n00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:56.080\nevery volume If I want to do\nthe system files and folders,\n\n339\n00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.240\nwe don't normally need that cuz\nthe OSX install put those back.\n\n340\n00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:03.700\nWe can do automatic backups, you can do\nlocal snapshots which was introduced back\n\n341\n00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.450\nin Mavericks, that'll let you do the...\n\n342\n00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.030\nIf you're offline you can\nbackup to your own hard drive.\n\n343\n00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:10.790\nIf you have laptops,\n\n344\n00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:14.810\nthis is the laptop policy here,\nthey don't have a ton of SSD storage.\n\n345\n00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:18.240\nIf you went with SSD, so\nyou probably don't want that turned on.\n\n346\n00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.650\nBut if you've got the tera bit\nregular spinning drive in there and\n\n347\n00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.387\nthat the local snapshot\ncan be kinda handy.\n\n348\n00:17:24.387 --> 00:17:27.250\nYou can limit the backup sizes and\neven excluded paths.\n\n349\n00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:32.580\nWe can set all of this right here, and\nnow you get a new laptop you enroll it and\n\n350\n00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.870\nsold in this group, and now time\nmachine is automatically setup, and\n\n351\n00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.470\nsoftware updates are automatically setup.\n\n352\n00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.010\nThe power policy's already set up.\n\n353\n00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:42.090\nAll these things are automatically\nconfigured for us.\n\n354\n00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:46.590\nAnd if a user changes the settings,\nit just puts them right back again.\n\n355\n00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.770\nSo we can ensure that the machines are\nconfigured exactly the way that we want.\n\n356\n00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.190\nThat's the nice part about these profiles.\n\n357\n00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.370\nWhat are some other good ones.\n\n358\n00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.430\nAccessibility, accessibility's a nice one\n\n359\n00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.420\nIf you wanna make sure that\nthat's set up for people.\n\n360\n00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:03.090\nYou might even have certain laptops\nthat you know are gonna be used for\n\n361\n00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:06.520\npeople with hearing impairments or\nvisual impairments.\n\n362\n00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.210\nSo you could create groups that say,\nvisual impaired devices, or\n\n363\n00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:12.680\nhearing impaired devices.\n\n364\n00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.330\nAnd when you hire a new employee and they\nsay, well, I have a auditory impairment so\n\n365\n00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:20.110\nI need this, this, and this,\nyou say, hey, no problem.\n\n366\n00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.590\nI'm going to take your laptop and\nstick it in this profile, and\n\n367\n00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:25.760\nit will automatically get it set up with\nall of the different things that you need\n\n368\n00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.030\nfor hearing, or vision, or interacting.\n\n369\n00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.810\nSo you can get those set up.\n\n370\n00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:36.100\nI know I always use the gesture zoom,\nwhere is gesture zoom in here?\n\n371\n00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:40.470\nDoes it not have a-, Zoom via keyboard,\nZoom via ScrollWheel, Scroll wheel.\n\n372\n00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:44.140\nHm, I guess you can't do gesture zoom.\n\n373\n00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.090\nNot every setting is reflected here.\n\n374\n00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:49.430\nSo I guess I found one that isn't.\n\n375\n00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.700\nSo there's also custom settings.\n\n376\n00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.209\nCustom settings is kinda a strange one.\n\n377\n00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.320\nIf there's something like GestureZoom\nthat I know I wanna turn on and\n\n378\n00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.370\nit's not here in the UI.\n\n379\n00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:05.500\nIf I can find the defaults\ncommand that modifies it, then\n\n380\n00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.470\nyou can manually put in the key in the\nvalue here and it can modify that setting.\n\n381\n00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.980\nSo you can technically modify anything but\nI'd have to go and dig and\n\n382\n00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:12.700\ndo some research.\n\n383\n00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.550\nI'd have to go to Apple's documentation\nand figure out where the default is\n\n384\n00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.170\nstored for the gesture zoom and\nthen I could put it in here.\n\n385\n00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:22.200\nSo just because I don't have a UI element\nfor it doesn't mean I can't do it,\n\n386\n00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.550\nit just means it's going\nto be a little bit harder.\n\n387\n00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.060\nSo you could put all kinds\nof crazy stuff in there.\n\n388\n00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:30.020\nLet's see what else is fun in here\nsince we're kind of browsing around,\n\n389\n00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.890\nI didn't really mess with identifications.\n\n390\n00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.920\nLet me go back into identifications.\n\n391\n00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:38.810\nHere's where you can set user display\nname, email address, user name, password.\n\n392\n00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.560\nWhat the heck is this all about?\n\n393\n00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.940\nWell if I'm applying this to laptops I\nprobably don't wanna mess with it but\n\n394\n00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.740\nif I'm applying it to a user.\n\n395\n00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.230\nI can actually use these settings to\nenforce the user name to set a certain way\n\n396\n00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:53.100\nand force the password\nto be set a certain way.\n\n397\n00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.230\nIf somebody changes the name or\nchanges the password,\n\n398\n00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:56.590\nthis will put it back, right.\n\n399\n00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.480\nIt'll also make sure it's\ninitially configured correctly.\n\n400\n00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.390\nCuz when somebody turns\non a brand new Mac.\n\n401\n00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.700\nThey can pick whatever\nname they want can't they?\n\n402\n00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.690\nBut now I can set this in place and\nit enforces that name and enforces it, so\n\n403\n00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:11.650\nyou can change that users identity right\nhere, so kind of a not a very commonly\n\n404\n00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:15.520\nused option but one is buried in there.\n\n405\n00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.870\nAll right so basically those are some of\nthe main settings we've also got some\n\n406\n00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:22.020\nother restrictions which\ncan be kinda a nice,\n\n407\n00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.280\nif this is going to be\na student machine for example.\n\n408\n00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.800\nI might want to come in and restrict and\n\n409\n00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.550\nsay you can only get to\ncertain preference panels.\n\n410\n00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:32.780\nSo I might say restrict items\nin system preferences, and\n\n411\n00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:36.675\nI might want to hide things like users and\ngroups and just show.\n\n412\n00:20:36.675 --> 00:20:42.855\nSome of the really general kind of stuff\nthat a normal user might need to see.\n\n413\n00:20:42.855 --> 00:20:45.145\nRight, so Im going to come in here and\n\n414\n00:20:45.145 --> 00:20:48.025\ntake out anything I think\nthey can cause damage with.\n\n415\n00:20:48.025 --> 00:20:51.650\nSo this is quite a few preferences\nthat people can cause damage with.\n\n416\n00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.100\nActually you know what, let me do\na select none cuz it would be easier for\n\n417\n00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.590\nme to pick what I want them to have.\n\n418\n00:20:55.590 --> 00:21:01.020\nSo maybe I want them to get General,\nAccessibility, Bluetooth I suppose\n\n419\n00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:06.340\nis okay, Mission Control, Notifications.\n\n420\n00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.450\nThese are things that a regular end user\ncould use and not really cause trouble.\n\n421\n00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:15.930\nAnd Spotlight settings and that's probably\nabout it, maybe Time machine, right.\n\n422\n00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:19.650\nSo I'm gonna limit what they\nsee in system preferences to\n\n423\n00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.820\nbasically keep me out of trouble,\nright, someone put those in place.\n\n424\n00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:27.790\nNow all of this is happening\nkind of not really in real time.\n\n425\n00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.460\nIt's happening right here in my browser.\n\n426\n00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.900\nAnd it's not until I hit okay that that's\ngonna get saved and I've got some errors.\n\n427\n00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:34.500\nWhere are my errors?\n\n428\n00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.030\nSo it told me I've got some errors, right?\n\n429\n00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:41.090\nProbably because I turned some things\non and didn't actually customize them.\n\n430\n00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.660\nSo I need to find my errors and\n\n431\n00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.940\nif you just scroll down\nit'll highlight the errors.\n\n432\n00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.320\nSo under identification I turned it on,\nbut I didn't set anything.\n\n433\n00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.940\nSo now I have three warnings for\n\n434\n00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.300\nme over here, and\nI didn't actually want to set this.\n\n435\n00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.890\nSo if I'm not gonna use it,\nit's hard to see, but way up here,\n\n436\n00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:00.640\nthere's this little minus sign, and\nhitting that will delete the payload.\n\n437\n00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.690\nAnd so that'll take that one out, so\nthat takes care of that error, and\n\n438\n00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:05.100\nwhere's my other area.\n\n439\n00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.060\nThere we go, under custom, same thing.\n\n440\n00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.470\nI turned it on but I didn't use it.\n\n441\n00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.640\nSo I'm just going to hit that little\nminus sign to get rid of it too.\n\n442\n00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.170\nAll right.\nSo one system, I can hit okay.\n\n443\n00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.040\nAnd now, I've got a profile.\n\n444\n00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.140\nI set out to do Power Management,\nI kinda went a little crazy on this one so\n\n445\n00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.830\nyou'll see I got a ton of stuff here.\n\n446\n00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.160\nBut now this has got a lot of stuff.\n\n447\n00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.520\nOkay and it's in place,\n\n448\n00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.930\nit's going to apply to any laptops\nin my system and I'm gonna hit save.\n\n449\n00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:32.134\nSo it's gonna save those settings.\n\n450\n00:22:32.134 --> 00:22:36.720\nOkay, now under Laptops,\nif I go to Members over here,\n\n451\n00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.260\nI can see that Teacher Laptops and\nStudent Laptops are a part of it.\n\n452\n00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:46.720\nAnd if I go to Teacher Laptops, I can\nsee that Don's Mac is a part of that.\n\n453\n00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.860\nSo, my Mac is a Teacher Laptop, and\nTeacher Laptop's are a part of Laptop's.\n\n454\n00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.750\nSo the teacher profile that\napplies there should apply to me.\n\n455\n00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.480\nQuick word of warning,\n\n456\n00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.650\nyou could have multiple policies\napply to the same device.\n\n457\n00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:02.790\nSo I could have settings\non teacher laptops.\n\n458\n00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.820\nAnd I could have settings on laptops.\n\n459\n00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.480\nAnd I could have the Dom account.\n\n460\n00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.800\nAnd all three of them could hit.\n\n461\n00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.360\nAnd if I have the same\nsetting In all three of them.\n\n462\n00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.360\nRight.\nMaybe one sets a wallpaper to\n\n463\n00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.270\nBackstreet Boys and\nanother one sets the wallpaper to NSYNC.\n\n464\n00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.920\nNow we got a battle.\n\n465\n00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.920\nWe got a boy band battle, right.\n\n466\n00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.570\nWho wins?\n\n467\n00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:26.645\nIt's kinda tough to say.\n\n468\n00:23:26.645 --> 00:23:28.610\n[LAUGH] It's actually kinda tricky.\n\n469\n00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:29.800\nUsually the user one will win.\n\n470\n00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.330\nI say usually, because sometimes\nit doesn't, and if that happens,\n\n471\n00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:34.630\nyou end up with this user conflict.\n\n472\n00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:38.130\nAnd so it's really important\nthat you test your profiles.\n\n473\n00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:40.004\nTest them out to make sure\nthey work correctly and\n\n474\n00:23:40.004 --> 00:23:42.843\nthat you're getting the end result,\nbecause you might have a conflict.\n\n475\n00:23:42.843 --> 00:23:46.700\nAnd unfortunately, as powerful and\nrobust as the profile manager is,\n\n476\n00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.961\nit doesn't do good conflict detection.\n\n477\n00:23:48.961 --> 00:23:50.470\nSo it's up to you to do that.\n\n478\n00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.720\nSo, we need to go to a machine and\ncheck it out and see and\n\n479\n00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.643\nmake sure this applies, okay.\n\n480\n00:23:55.643 --> 00:23:58.280\nNow, we made the changes here.\n\n481\n00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.790\nThe changes are being sent to Apple.\n\n482\n00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:02.230\nNot the changes themselves, but\n\n483\n00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:06.100\nreally a push to Apple saying hey,\nlet everybody know there's a change.\n\n484\n00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:10.450\nAnd the push from Apple is then\ngonna go back down to Don's Mac.\n\n485\n00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:13.890\nAnd Don's Mac is gonna say, look there's\nbeen an update, I need to deal with that.\n\n486\n00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:15.490\nAnd it's gonna apply those settings.\n\n487\n00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.380\nAnd hopefully it's happening right now,\nokay?\n\n488\n00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:22.700\nBut some changes require a user\nto log out and log back on.\n\n489\n00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.670\nOther changes require the entire machine\nto reboot before they take effect.\n\n490\n00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:30.680\nSo it is possible that I might see\nsome settings and not see others.\n\n491\n00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.270\nAll right, it might be that\nI see nothing has changed.\n\n492\n00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:37.430\nSo if I go back to that laptop and\nI get logged in, right?\n\n493\n00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:41.250\nSo here I am logged in and things\nmight not look any different at all.\n\n494\n00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:45.060\nIf I go into System Preferences I still\nsee all my System Preferences all right\n\n495\n00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:45.910\nthere, okay?\n\n496\n00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:50.840\nSo you might need to reboot\nthe machine before it takes effect,\n\n497\n00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.410\nor you could manually apply the policy.\n\n498\n00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:56.570\nIf you're in a real hurry, right,\nI could always come in here and\n\n499\n00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.900\ngo to Laptops, and go to Settings.\n\n500\n00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.710\nSo here is all of\nthe settings that I just did.\n\n501\n00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.770\nAnd notice how there's a Download button.\n\n502\n00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:10.960\nI can download that device policy,\njust like we saw in episode two.\n\n503\n00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.778\nJust like episode two, I can download that\npolicy and just run it on the client and\n\n504\n00:25:14.778 --> 00:25:16.760\nit'll take effect right away.\n\n505\n00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.190\nWell I might still have to reboot right?\n\n506\n00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:20.710\nThat can certainly happen.\n\n507\n00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:21.610\nAnd, it's offering\n\n508\n00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:23.680\nto install this on my server I\ndefinitely don't want this on my server.\n\n509\n00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.910\nSo let me cancel that.\n\n510\n00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:27.030\nI don't want it on the server because,\nremember,\n\n511\n00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:29.030\nI restricted the system preferences and so\n\n512\n00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:31.990\nthat would kind of stink if I couldn't\nget into the system preferences.\n\n513\n00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:36.200\nBut now that it is downloaded,\nI can go and copy that.\n\n514\n00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.060\nAnd so I'm gonna find my settings for\nlaptop.\n\n515\n00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.930\nAnd I'm gonna drop that in a little\nshared folder I used in episode two so\n\n516\n00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.510\nthat we can load it, all right.\n\n517\n00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:46.760\nAnd I'm just trying to save\na little time from rebooting.\n\n518\n00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.750\nI don't wanna reboot if I don't have to.\n\n519\n00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:53.500\nAnd so I'm gonna come and\nfind that and just run it, and\n\n520\n00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.100\nwe're gonna get it installed.\n\n521\n00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.050\nSo if I had waited long enough,\nit would have applied on its own, or\n\n522\n00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:00.920\nif I rebooted it would have applied.\n\n523\n00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.723\nAnd once it's in,\ndid I run the wrong thing?\n\n524\n00:26:06.781 --> 00:26:08.016\nLet's see.\n\n525\n00:26:11.532 --> 00:26:17.215\nAll right, this screen's not refreshing\nfor me, but it's supposed to have loaded.\n\n526\n00:26:17.215 --> 00:26:19.254\n[LAUGH] The screen's kind of frozen.\n\n527\n00:26:19.254 --> 00:26:20.560\nI got my pinwheel of doom!\n\n528\n00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.650\nAll right, well this does happen because\nit's applying a lot of settings.\n\n529\n00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.350\nI probably should have just down power\nmanagement for the demonstration.\n\n530\n00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:27.190\nThere we go.\nSo\n\n531\n00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.990\nit was having to run through all those\ndifferent settings to view them,\n\n532\n00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:31.840\nand now it's just saying,\nam I sure I wanna install it?\n\n533\n00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.926\nI'll go ahead and say yes.\n\n534\n00:26:32.926 --> 00:26:36.400\n[LAUGH] And log out required.\n\n535\n00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.462\nI was trying to dodge having to log out,\nbut it's telling me no,\n\n536\n00:26:39.462 --> 00:26:40.439\nI do have to log out.\n\n537\n00:26:40.439 --> 00:26:44.012\nAnd in fact I'm probably better\noff just rebooting in general, but\n\n538\n00:26:44.012 --> 00:26:47.850\nwe'll do a quick log out, so\nwe can see some of the settings apply.\n\n539\n00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:52.470\nIt's installing it right now, all those\nchanges are being put into effect and\n\n540\n00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:54.590\nhonestly, this probably would have\nhappened if I'd waited anyway.\n\n541\n00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:57.930\nBut as soon as this is done, I'll be able\nto log out, and we'll see the changes.\n\n542\n00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:01.650\n>> Don, if you do a manual import of\nthe profile like you're showing us here,\n\n543\n00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:03.870\ndo we still have to worry about\nthe same kind of conflicts?\n\n544\n00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:06.630\nWill this be no different than it being\npushed out from the server itself?\n\n545\n00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.900\n>> Yeah, it'd be the same thing.\n\n546\n00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.450\nYou could still have a conflict.\n\n547\n00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:13.880\nI have two profiles already in place, and\nso I could be conflicting with those.\n\n548\n00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.850\nI don't think we messed with any\nsettings that would cause a conflict\n\n549\n00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:17.840\nhere, but you could.\n\n550\n00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.150\nAnd so you would just need to check.\n\n551\n00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:22.300\nIn fact, this is kind of one of\nthe ways that I test a new profile,\n\n552\n00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:27.160\nis I'll download it and install it\nmanually on a machine prior to putting\n\n553\n00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.890\nall the other machines in that group and\nhaving it deploy across the network.\n\n554\n00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:31.770\nSo we'll be able to see that.\n\n555\n00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:34.790\n>> So for you, you would say that your\nmanual deployment kind of becomes your\n\n556\n00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.676\ntest environment before rolling it\nout to a production environment?\n\n557\n00:27:37.676 --> 00:27:38.248\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n558\n00:27:38.248 --> 00:27:39.306\n>> Okay good.\n\n559\n00:27:39.306 --> 00:27:40.320\n>> So that's basically it.\n\n560\n00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.234\nAnd once this is done,\nwe'll look at it and we'll see.\n\n561\n00:27:42.234 --> 00:27:45.647\nNow it's just kind of a waiting game\nwhen we sit and see what happens.\n\n562\n00:27:45.647 --> 00:27:48.800\nWhoa, and just when I'm about ready\nto give up on it, it finishes.\n\n563\n00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.666\nSo there it goes, it just finished and\nI can see right here Settings for Laptops.\n\n564\n00:27:51.666 --> 00:27:55.420\nIt's got 19 settings in place,\nso all that stuff is there.\n\n565\n00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:58.890\nIt did tell me I need to log out to see\nthis in action so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n566\n00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:00.500\nlog out.\n\n567\n00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.090\nWe'll do the long log out.\n\n568\n00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:05.840\nAnd when we go to log back in, we need\nto verify the settings took effect, and\n\n569\n00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.570\nwe're looking for things like conflicts.\n\n570\n00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:11.090\nAnd I can see this machine is for\nauthorized users only.\n\n571\n00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:13.530\nUnauthorized use is forbidden.\n\n572\n00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:15.640\nI'm shaking in my boots.\n\n573\n00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.555\nI'm bound to an open directory,\ncuz I've got the other showing up, so\n\n574\n00:28:18.555 --> 00:28:20.055\nI can login via the network.\n\n575\n00:28:20.055 --> 00:28:21.829\nAnd I've got my regular user account.\n\n576\n00:28:21.829 --> 00:28:24.025\nI'm just gonna login with it for now.\n\n577\n00:28:24.025 --> 00:28:26.605\nAnd once I login, well,\n\n578\n00:28:26.605 --> 00:28:29.735\nI'm expecting to see my system\npreferences be restricted, right?\n\n579\n00:28:29.735 --> 00:28:30.475\nSo that I can't go in and\n\n580\n00:28:30.475 --> 00:28:32.950\nstart messing with all the crazy\nsetting that are in there.\n\n581\n00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:36.230\nThese are all those profile\nsettings taking affect.\n\n582\n00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:38.226\nThe main one I set out to\nprovide was power management.\n\n583\n00:28:38.226 --> 00:28:42.297\nAnd in hindsight, I restricted access to\nthe power management system preference,\n\n584\n00:28:42.297 --> 00:28:43.170\ndidn't I, Wes?\n\n585\n00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:46.790\nSo I can't verify that stupid setting\nthat I set out to do in the first place.\n\n586\n00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:51.060\nBut I know that my login window had\nthe banner message, so I know that worked.\n\n587\n00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:54.060\nI know that my login options\nwere different, that worked.\n\n588\n00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:57.560\nI'm gonna go into system preferences\nas soon as I'm done logging in and\n\n589\n00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:03.110\nwe'll get a chance to see that and\nthere we go.\n\n590\n00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:06.300\nSo once I get logged in,\nI'll jump into my system preferences, and\n\n591\n00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.550\nhopefully I'll just see a small selection.\n\n592\n00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:13.090\nRight, well, I see them all, but notice\nhow a lot of them are grayed out, right?\n\n593\n00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:16.420\nSo I can go into General, and\nthere's my general settings.\n\n594\n00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:20.070\nBut if I try and go into Language\n& Region, or Energy Saver, or\n\n595\n00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.880\nKeyboard they're all grayed out, right?\n\n596\n00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.470\nI'm restricted,\nI can't get to those anymore.\n\n597\n00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:26.190\nThe Profile Manager's applying it, right?\n\n598\n00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.990\nSo this is the real power\nof the Profile Manager.\n\n599\n00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:33.060\nAnd I used it here to restrict things,\nright, I locked things down.\n\n600\n00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.649\nBut that's not the only use for it.\n\n601\n00:29:34.649 --> 00:29:39.234\nYou can use it to just set up defaults, to\nget machines configured to be ready to use\n\n602\n00:29:39.234 --> 00:29:42.425\non day one, to already be\njoined to your open directory,\n\n603\n00:29:42.425 --> 00:29:44.670\nto have your company's wallpaper.\n\n604\n00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:46.770\nIt's not all about restrictions, right?\n\n605\n00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:50.768\nIt's about having a consistent\nconfiguration across your entire company.\n\n606\n00:29:50.768 --> 00:29:54.807\nYou can actually save a lot of money\nif you have thousands of desktops and\n\n607\n00:29:54.807 --> 00:29:57.620\nyou make a profile that says,\nyou know what?\n\n608\n00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:01.480\nAt 6 PM tell the machine to go to sleep\nand then wake it back up at 6 AM.\n\n609\n00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.199\nWell, if people get off at work at 5 PM,\n\n610\n00:30:03.199 --> 00:30:05.490\nwhat do they care if\nit goes to sleep at 6?\n\n611\n00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:08.689\nAnd if they don't come in to work until\n8 AM, and the machine wakes up at 6 AM,\n\n612\n00:30:08.689 --> 00:30:12.193\nit's already woken up by the time they get\nin, they don't even know it went to sleep.\n\n613\n00:30:12.193 --> 00:30:15.598\nMeanwhile, you save electricity,\nyour electric bill goes down,\n\n614\n00:30:15.598 --> 00:30:18.475\nbecause 12 hours a day that\nmachine's not on anymore.\n\n615\n00:30:18.475 --> 00:30:22.110\nRight, you can actually do a lot of good\nwith this stuff, it's really powerful.\n\n616\n00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:23.900\nSpend some time,\njust go through the Profile Manager and\n\n617\n00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.720\ngo through all of the little settings\nthat are inside one of those profiles,\n\n618\n00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.990\nyou'd be surprised what you can do,\nit's impressive.\n\n619\n00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:30.120\n>> Don, that's a lot of great information.\n\n620\n00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:34.968\nAnd I told you we'd get him to show you\nthe configuration profile before this\n\n621\n00:30:34.968 --> 00:30:36.037\nepisode ended.\n\n622\n00:30:36.037 --> 00:30:37.566\nDon, thank you for everything, but\n\n623\n00:30:37.566 --> 00:30:39.792\nI do see that we're coming\nto the end of this episode.\n\n624\n00:30:39.792 --> 00:30:44.256\nBut before we leave, do you have any\nadvice on using the configuration profiles\n\n625\n00:30:44.256 --> 00:30:46.445\nand the Profile Manager behind it?\n\n626\n00:30:46.445 --> 00:30:48.535\n>> The main thing is test your profiles.\n\n627\n00:30:48.535 --> 00:30:52.155\nDon't write a profile and\njust apply it to 10,000 machines, right?\n\n628\n00:30:52.155 --> 00:30:55.140\nBecause if there was anything wrong in it,\nyou just did it 10,000 times.\n\n629\n00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:56.175\nThat's not good.\n\n630\n00:30:56.175 --> 00:30:59.385\nThat's what we like to call\na career changing event.\n\n631\n00:30:59.385 --> 00:31:03.770\nSo instead, any time you write a new\nprofile, just apply it to one or\n\n632\n00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:04.790\ntwo machines.\n\n633\n00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:08.070\nOr don't apply it to anybody and manually\ndownload the profile and install it and\n\n634\n00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:09.210\nrun it that way.\n\n635\n00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:13.670\nTest it, test the profile, make sure it\nworks the way you intend it to and then\n\n636\n00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:17.570\nroll it out across the entire environment,\nacross 10,000 machines or whatever.\n\n637\n00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:19.120\nThat's where the real\npower of this comes in,\n\n638\n00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.900\nis that you can manage\ntons of machines at once.\n\n639\n00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.640\n>> Well thank you sir, we appreciate\nall that good information and\n\n640\n00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.330\nwe appreciate you,\nthe viewer, for watching.\n\n641\n00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.444\nWe're gonna take this time\nto sign out here at ITProTV.\n\n642\n00:31:28.444 --> 00:31:29.828\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n643\n00:31:29.828 --> 00:31:30.726\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n644\n00:31:30.726 --> 00:31:33.005\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n645\n00:31:33.005 --> 00:31:37.740\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.764\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.764 --> 00:00:20.543\nin today's episode we're moving\nthrough our OS X Server fundamentals.\n\n5\n00:00:20.543 --> 00:00:23.696\nAnd joining me back in the studio again\nis none other than Mr Don Pezet, Don,\n\n6\n00:00:23.696 --> 00:00:25.050\nhow you doing today, sir?\n\n7\n00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.241\n>> I'm doing great, Wes,\n\n8\n00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:30.550\nI'm ready to tax everyone's mind with\nthe most complex topic imaginable.\n\n9\n00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.390\nSharing files.\n\n10\n00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.126\nThat's right,\n\n11\n00:00:32.126 --> 00:00:35.125\n[LAUGH] we're gonna take a look at\nsharing files in OS X Server today.\n\n12\n00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:37.530\nAnd I know, it sounds kind of ridiculous.\n\n13\n00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.010\nYou can share files very easily in Mac OS.\n\n14\n00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.170\nIt doesn't have to be a server.\n\n15\n00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.850\nAnybody can create a shared folder and\nshare it on the network.\n\n16\n00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.050\nBut in the server app, we do actually\nhave a special sharing service in there.\n\n17\n00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.320\nAnd a lot of people don't necessarily\nunderstand the difference between\n\n18\n00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.450\nthe sharing service in the server\nversus the sharing service\n\n19\n00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.658\non your own desktop and what that is.\n\n20\n00:00:57.658 --> 00:01:00.496\nSo we're gonna take a look at that today,\nwhat the difference is, how we get it\n\n21\n00:01:00.496 --> 00:01:03.042\nconfigured, and why we'd even use\nthe darn thing in the first place.\n\n22\n00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:05.690\nSo couple of neat little\nthings to look at there.\n\n23\n00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.171\n>> Don, one of the things we\nalways have to look at, right,\n\n24\n00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:10.756\nwhen it comes to file sharing,\nwe got a host of protocols for\n\n25\n00:01:10.756 --> 00:01:14.458\ndifferent operating systems out there and\nwe always talk about interoperability.\n\n26\n00:01:14.458 --> 00:01:18.160\nSo when it comes to sharing, what are some\nof the protocols we can expect to see?\n\n27\n00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.490\n>> All right, now in your just\nregular old Mac OS system,\n\n28\n00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.740\neven if you don't have the server app\ninstalled, you can share a folder and\n\n29\n00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.840\nthere's two primary file sharing\nprotocols that you're gonna see used.\n\n30\n00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.730\nThere's AFP,\nwhich is the Apple File Protocol, and\n\n31\n00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.190\nif you got all Macs then that's\nprobably what you're using, right?\n\n32\n00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.060\nAFP, it's been around a long time,\nit's very robust.\n\n33\n00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.270\nIt does a great job copying files and\ntransferring data, and\n\n34\n00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.670\nit works really well.\n\n35\n00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.350\nIt even supports advanced things, like the\nfile meta data, Time Machine backups, and\n\n36\n00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.520\nmultiple instance copies of files.\n\n37\n00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.100\nIt does all that stuff really well,\nit's a great protocol.\n\n38\n00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.167\nThe only problem is,\nit's an Apple protocol.\n\n39\n00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:58.130\nWait, that sounds like\nApple's the problem.\n\n40\n00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.900\nIt's not the fact that it's an Apple\nproduct, it's just that it's Apple only.\n\n41\n00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.730\nThere's other systems out there,\nlike Linux machines and\n\n42\n00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.770\nWindows machines, right?\n\n43\n00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.060\nIn the business world you see a lot\nof Microsoft Windows machines and\n\n44\n00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.240\nthey don't run Apple File Protocol.\n\n45\n00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.197\nThey actually did for\na little while back in the early 2000s,\n\n46\n00:02:14.197 --> 00:02:17.708\nMicrosoft had licensed it for a little\nwhile, but they don't do it anymore.\n\n47\n00:02:17.708 --> 00:02:22.918\nNow, well, they use SMB,\nwhich is called Server Message Block.\n\n48\n00:02:22.918 --> 00:02:26.985\nIn the Windows world, Microsoft,\nactually Intel originally created SMB and\n\n49\n00:02:26.985 --> 00:02:28.410\nthen Microsoft bought it.\n\n50\n00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.880\nSo Microsoft owns SMB, they've been using\nit for years and years and years and\n\n51\n00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.630\nyears.\n\n52\n00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.750\nAnd there's parts of it\nthat they've open sourced,\n\n53\n00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.520\nthey've made available to other\nvendors that are out there.\n\n54\n00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.360\nAnd so SMB, Server Message Block, it was\noriginally a Microsoft-only protocol, but\n\n55\n00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.690\nnow, Linux and Mac support it.\n\n56\n00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.820\nSo that means that you can have all of\nthese systems running the same protocol to\n\n57\n00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.190\nshare files and folders.\n\n58\n00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.108\nSo on a Mac, when you share a folder,\n\n59\n00:02:53.108 --> 00:02:58.190\nyou're normally sharing it with AFP and\nwith SMB.\n\n60\n00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.270\nNow, a couple little things to remember\nhere is, it's not a perfect marriage,\n\n61\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.250\nright, between Linux, Windows, and\nMac, as far as SMB is concerned.\n\n62\n00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.670\nThere's multiple versions\nof SMB that are out there.\n\n63\n00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.004\nOn a new Windows machine,\nif you have a machine running Windows 10,\n\n64\n00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:14.708\nit's running SMB version 3.0.\n\n65\n00:03:14.708 --> 00:03:17.492\nAnd it's got a lot of fancy features\nbaked into it like encryption and\n\n66\n00:03:17.492 --> 00:03:19.610\ncompression and all this other stuff.\n\n67\n00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.190\nWell, the parts that Microsoft\nopen sourced out to the world\n\n68\n00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.670\nwere part of SMB 2.0.\n\n69\n00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.500\nAnd so most Linux boxes,\nmost Macs are running SMB 2.0 not 3.0.\n\n70\n00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.516\nSo there are a few bells and whistles that\nMicrosoft holds for their own OS, but for\n\n71\n00:03:33.516 --> 00:03:35.900\nthe most part, we don't care about those.\n\n72\n00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.020\nBut the nice thing is that you can\nshare a folder on your Mac and\n\n73\n00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.565\nyou can share that data with other Macs\nand with Windows machines and with Linux\n\n74\n00:03:44.565 --> 00:03:48.570\nmachines all in one happy little family\nand everything worked great, right?\n\n75\n00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.460\nNow for a normal Mac, that's kind of the\nextent of it, we see those two protocols.\n\n76\n00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.710\nBut if you've got the server app\ninstalled, there's a little bit more.\n\n77\n00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.120\nFor example,\nit brings in a protocol called WebDAV.\n\n78\n00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.600\nAnd WebDAV it stands for\nWeb Distributed Authoring and Versioning.\n\n79\n00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.800\nAnd what WebDAV was designed to do was\nto allow file sharing using the HTTP,\n\n80\n00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.060\nor Hypertext Transport Protocol.\n\n81\n00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.084\nAnd HTTP, you guys use it every day.\n\n82\n00:04:13.084 --> 00:04:15.560\nYou're probably using it right now\nwhen you're watching the show.\n\n83\n00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.290\nWhen you go to a website you're using\nHTTP, so everybody supports that.\n\n84\n00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.543\nWebDAV lets you do file\nsharing using HTTP.\n\n85\n00:04:23.543 --> 00:04:25.440\nThe tricky part there is authentication,\nright?\n\n86\n00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.250\nYou gotta have a method to authenticate\nand that's what WebDAV takes care of.\n\n87\n00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.110\nSo on a Mac OS machine that\nhas the server app installed,\n\n88\n00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.590\nyou can use WebDAV if you want.\n\n89\n00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.830\nNow I'll tell you,\nwhile everybody supports WebDAV,\n\n90\n00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.780\nvery few people actually use it.\n\n91\n00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.900\nEvery Windows machine supports WebDAV,\nevery Mac OS machine,\n\n92\n00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.090\nevery Linux machine does, but most users\ndon't make use of it because it's harder.\n\n93\n00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.020\nThe other protocols like AFP and\nSMB, they're easier.\n\n94\n00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.280\nYou can just browse the network and\nyou find the systems, right?\n\n95\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.750\nBut with WebDAV, you have to\nknow exactly where you wanna go.\n\n96\n00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.910\nThink of it as like a website, right?\n\n97\n00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.090\nWhen I fire up a web browser, I don't say\n\n98\n00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.550\nshow me every website in the entire world\nand then I'll pick the one I want, right?\n\n99\n00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.000\nThat wouldn't be an optimal way to do it.\n\n100\n00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.989\nWhen I fire up a web browser, I type in\nexactly what I want, www.google.com, and\n\n101\n00:05:16.989 --> 00:05:18.000\nI go right to it.\n\n102\n00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.719\nI have to already know where I wanna go,\nthat's how WebDAV is.\n\n103\n00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.760\nApple File Protocol and\nServer Message Blocks, so\n\n104\n00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.320\nAFP and SMB, they work the other way.\n\n105\n00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.200\nWhen you launch them, you say show\nme every file share in the world.\n\n106\n00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.991\nWell, the world is just your\nlocal area network and so\n\n107\n00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:38.667\nyou see all the file shares,\nall the servers that are on your network.\n\n108\n00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:43.029\nAnd then you can browse and find the one\nyou want, so AFP and SMB are designed for\n\n109\n00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:47.790\nthat kind of browsing, that just\ncasual looking and finding stuff.\n\n110\n00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.750\nWebDAV is designed specifically\nif you know what you want, and\n\n111\n00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.740\nthat's why people don't use it.\n\n112\n00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.845\nThat's why it's not any more\npopular than it really should be.\n\n113\n00:05:53.845 --> 00:05:55.600\nBut those are the three main protocols.\n\n114\n00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.750\nNow those are the ones we're\ngonna address here on the show.\n\n115\n00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.600\nThere are a few others, though.\n\n116\n00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.667\nFor example, Mac OS under the hood,\nwhat operating system is it?\n\n117\n00:06:03.667 --> 00:06:05.380\nIt's BSD Unix.\n\n118\n00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.440\nAnd in the Unix world you have NFS,\nthe Network File System.\n\n119\n00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.042\nAnd you have FTP, File Transfer Protocol.\n\n120\n00:06:12.042 --> 00:06:16.617\nAnd if you have SSH, the Secure\nShell Protocol, you can do SFTP, or\n\n121\n00:06:16.617 --> 00:06:19.170\nSecure File Transfer Protocol.\n\n122\n00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.390\nWhere FTP is then stacked on top\nof SSH to encrypt the data, right?\n\n123\n00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.200\nSo there's three protocols right there,\nNFS, FTP, and\n\n124\n00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.780\nSFTP that are built into BSD Unix\nunder the hood in Mac OS.\n\n125\n00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.860\nYou're probably not gonna\nsee them on the exam and\n\n126\n00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.460\nApple doesn't expect you to know them,\nbut they are there and you can use them.\n\n127\n00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.470\nI use them all the time myself for moving\ndata especially between Unix systems.\n\n128\n00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.900\nSo if I have Linux servers or whatever,\n\n129\n00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.850\nit's really handy to move\nthat stuff with those.\n\n130\n00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.520\nBut as far as your primary sharing,\nit's gonna be SMB,\n\n131\n00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.610\nand AFP alongside WebDAV.\n\n132\n00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.385\n>> Don, you've told before in just general\nconversation when we're talking hey,\n\n133\n00:06:57.385 --> 00:07:02.110\nWes go to the storage, that shared folder,\nright, you typed the UNC path.\n\n134\n00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.052\nAnd I noticed that through the series and\nsome of the Apple shows,\n\n135\n00:07:05.052 --> 00:07:08.710\nother Apple shows that we have, Apple\ntends to have unique names for something.\n\n136\n00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.462\nLike, for instance, a bootable\ndrive is called a blessed drive.\n\n137\n00:07:11.462 --> 00:07:14.640\nInside [LAUGH] of the Apple\nworld do we have any specifics?\n\n138\n00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.400\nDo we have any, like a term that's\ncommon to Apple when it comes to that?\n\n139\n00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.080\n>> Yeah, Wes, and\nI'm kinda guilty of not using it myself.\n\n140\n00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.208\nI say a shared folder,\nright, cuz what do we do?\n\n141\n00:07:24.208 --> 00:07:26.710\nWe make a folder and we share\nthe contents on the network, [LAUGH] so\n\n142\n00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.080\nI call it a shared folder.\n\n143\n00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.125\nBut in the Apple world they like\nto call them share points, right?\n\n144\n00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:35.778\nA share point is a point somewhere in\nyour storage that you're sharing out on\n\n145\n00:07:35.778 --> 00:07:37.010\nthe network.\n\n146\n00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.560\nThey make that distinction,\n\n147\n00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.110\nbecause what you're sharing\nmight not actually be a folder.\n\n148\n00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.418\nWhat you're sharing might be an alias,\nor it might even be an individual file.\n\n149\n00:07:44.418 --> 00:07:46.775\nYou can do that,\nyou're not supposed to, but you can.\n\n150\n00:07:46.775 --> 00:07:48.895\nSo they just use that\nslightly more generic term,\n\n151\n00:07:48.895 --> 00:07:50.871\nbecause a share point\ncould also be a printer.\n\n152\n00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:51.428\nRight?\n\n153\n00:07:51.428 --> 00:07:54.743\nA printer is not a shared folder a printer\nis a print device that we're sharing out\n\n154\n00:07:54.743 --> 00:07:55.437\non the network.\n\n155\n00:07:55.437 --> 00:07:59.290\nSo, on the exam you'll likely see and\nrefer to is as a share point.\n\n156\n00:08:00.428 --> 00:08:03.770\nNow, as far as the sharing\nsystem itself goes,\n\n157\n00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.640\nthere's actually two different systems for\nsharing folders.\n\n158\n00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.420\nThere's the one that's built into Mac OS,\nand\n\n159\n00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.410\nthen there's one that's\nbuilt Into the server app.\n\n160\n00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.270\nAnd just to kind of refresh our memories,\n\n161\n00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.010\nlet's start with the one\nthat's built into Mac OS.\n\n162\n00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:18.750\nSo, here I'm gonna take my server, and let\nme just stash the server app away here.\n\n163\n00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.530\nAnd we're just gonna go\nregular old Mac OS style.\n\n164\n00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:26.800\nAnd if I go into my System Preferences,\nand I go into the Sharing\n\n165\n00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.820\nsystem preference, right in here you'll\nsee where we've got File sharing.\n\n166\n00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.010\nAnd I can share out some files,\nlike Don Pezet's public folder,\n\n167\n00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.310\nthat's the default one\nwe're gonna share out, and\n\n168\n00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:40.250\nI can see the permissions that\nare being assigned to it, okay?\n\n169\n00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.810\nSo if I come in and turn this is on,\nso I'm gonna turn on file sharing,\n\n170\n00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:46.860\nnotice how the text up here kinda changes.\n\n171\n00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:52.000\nSo right now, it says file sharing off,\nand people can't get to my data.\n\n172\n00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.580\nBut as soon as I turn it\n\n173\n00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:00.860\non it says file sharing is on.\n\n174\n00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:06.610\nAnd other users can access shared\n\n175\n00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:10.480\nfolders on this computer,\nand administrators can\n\n176\n00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.020\naccess all volumes at afp://192.168.0.151\nor smb://192.168.0.151.\n\n177\n00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:19.230\nIt has turned on AFP for Apple File\nProtocol and SMB for Server Message Block.\n\n178\n00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.760\nI'm now doing both of those protocols.\n\n179\n00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.450\nThat's baked into the OS, we turn it on,\nand you can set the permissions for\n\n180\n00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.650\nthose folders and files right here.\n\n181\n00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:32.380\nSo my public folder by default\nhas where I can read and write.\n\n182\n00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.890\nThen everybody else just gets read only.\n\n183\n00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.310\nAnd I might wanna tweak those\npermissions and change them a bit, but\n\n184\n00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.410\nthat's the default permissions.\n\n185\n00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:43.460\nAnd if I hit Options, you'll see there's\nnot a whole heck of a lot of options in\n\n186\n00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.640\nhere, except I can tweak.\n\n187\n00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.860\nDo I want both protocols on, or just one?\n\n188\n00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.430\nI could turn off AFP and just do SMB.\n\n189\n00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.470\nOr I could turn off SMB, and just do AFP.\n\n190\n00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:55.830\nNow, why would I do that?\n\n191\n00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:00.670\nWell, if you have all Macs when\npeople browse the network they'll\n\n192\n00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.630\nactually see your system twice.They'll\nsee it as a Windows machine and\n\n193\n00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.510\nas a Mac and if they browse on\nthe Windows side they'll use SMB,\n\n194\n00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.550\nif they browse on the Mac\nside they'll use AFP.\n\n195\n00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:13.050\nYou might want to force everyone to\nuse AFP and so you could turn off SMB.\n\n196\n00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.600\nAnd now you're just running AFP and\nthat's it, right?\n\n197\n00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.730\nSo you might choose to do that, or\neven the other way around where you\n\n198\n00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.480\nforce everybody to use SMB so\nit's all consistent.\n\n199\n00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.500\nThere is a slight problem you can have, if\nyou use two protocols at the same time or\n\n200\n00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.380\nthree or four,\nhowever many protocols Protocols.\n\n201\n00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:33.560\nIf you just run one protocol,\nevery operation that's performed on a file\n\n202\n00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.010\nis performed through the same protocol\nthrough the same system on the computer,\n\n203\n00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.390\nso the operating system\nhandles it together.\n\n204\n00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.090\nBut if you're running two protocols,\n\n205\n00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:45.000\nit's two different software demons\nthat are managing that connection.\n\n206\n00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.860\nAnd if two people are connected\nto your system One on SMB and\n\n207\n00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:55.410\none on AFP, and they both go to access\nthe same file at the same time.\n\n208\n00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.620\nWhat's gonna happen?\n\n209\n00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.560\nIt's two different programs\naccessing the same file.\n\n210\n00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.450\nThat doesn't work.\n\n211\n00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.960\nSo you end up with locked file access.\n\n212\n00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.890\nOne person is gonna get an error, right?\n\n213\n00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.850\nTwo people can never truly do\nthe same thing at the same time.\n\n214\n00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.940\nSo that one of them is gonna be\na little offset from the other.\n\n215\n00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.120\nIt might be fractions of a second,\nbut there will be an offset.\n\n216\n00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.670\nAnd whoever comes in second place is\ngonna get a locking error, right?\n\n217\n00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.640\nIf it had all been done just through AFP,\nor all done just through SMB,\n\n218\n00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.890\nit can handle that better.\n\n219\n00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.970\nCuz it's all done through the same demon,\nit's able to manage that and\n\n220\n00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.660\nprovide that service connectivity.\n\n221\n00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.980\nSo, you may not want to run two protocols.\n\n222\n00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.237\nYou can tailor that right here and\nadjust it.\n\n223\n00:11:29.237 --> 00:11:32.946\n>> Don, I was looking at those resource\nlocators once you've enabled the sharing\n\n224\n00:11:32.946 --> 00:11:34.120\non your computer there.\n\n225\n00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.690\nAnd I'm familiar with the universal\nnaming conventions that we see\n\n226\n00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.820\ninside of some other systems.\n\n227\n00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:46.740\nIs this the standard inside\nof Apple is to use AFP://?\n\n228\n00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.520\nAnd if so, does the Universal Naming\nConvention come into browsing\n\n229\n00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.630\nshares and\n>> Yeah,\n\n230\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.380\nI mean that's basically how this works.\n\n231\n00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.060\nWe don't normally see it, right?\n\n232\n00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.110\nCuz we fire up our Finder and we navigate\nand we see a bunch of folders and\n\n233\n00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.820\nthat's it.\n\n234\n00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.860\nSo if I turn on this sharing,\nso I've turned it on here, and\n\n235\n00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:06.490\nI go over to another Mac like this one,\nI can just launch the Finder.\n\n236\n00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.270\nAnd in the Finder,\nI can go over here and find Shared.\n\n237\n00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.520\nAnd there I see OSX_SERVER.\n\n238\n00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.340\nAnd I can click on it and I guess I\ndidn't enable guest access on it.\n\n239\n00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.200\nSo I'm gonna have to connect as and\nI'll have to provide some credentials.\n\n240\n00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.230\nSo let me log in as myself.\n\n241\n00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.400\nAnd I connect, and there it is.\n\n242\n00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.360\nAnd I can see Dom Pazet's public folder.\n\n243\n00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.270\nAnd I can browse into it.\n\n244\n00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.650\nSo I never really saw the UNC.\n\n245\n00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:33.450\nSo UNC, the universal naming convention,\nI never really saw it, right?\n\n246\n00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.681\nBut, I could have instead\nof navigating that way,\n\n247\n00:12:36.681 --> 00:12:41.276\nI could've gone to my Go menu up top,\nand gone down to Connect to Server.\n\n248\n00:12:41.276 --> 00:12:43.705\nAnd when you choose Connect to Server,\n\n249\n00:12:43.705 --> 00:12:46.728\nnow you can type in the server\nbased on their UNC.\n\n250\n00:12:46.728 --> 00:12:52.598\nAnd so I could say,\nafp://192.168.0.151/ and\n\n251\n00:12:52.598 --> 00:12:56.577\nthe name of that folder,\nwhat was it called,\n\n252\n00:12:56.577 --> 00:13:00.683\nDon's public folder or\nsomething like that.\n\n253\n00:13:00.683 --> 00:13:02.738\nIf I get the name wrong\nit's not going to work,\n\n254\n00:13:02.738 --> 00:13:04.656\nbut if I get the name right it'll connect.\n\n255\n00:13:04.656 --> 00:13:08.050\nSo now I'm telling it to use AFP or\nI can come in here and\n\n256\n00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.810\nsay I want to do SMB instead And now\nit's gonna connect up and go that route.\n\n257\n00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.870\nYou can also do,\nwhere you leave the folder off.\n\n258\n00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.460\nAnd you'll just connect to the server and\nsee all the folders that are on it.\n\n259\n00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.335\nI'm doing it by IP,\nI could also do it by name.\n\n260\n00:13:23.335 --> 00:13:25.535\nAnd I could connect that way.\n\n261\n00:13:25.535 --> 00:13:28.445\nThat might be better, since I can't\nremember the name of the folder.\n\n262\n00:13:28.445 --> 00:13:34.295\nI'm punching it in here with\nthe fully qualified name.\n\n263\n00:13:34.295 --> 00:13:36.605\nI'm putting \".local\", but\nyou don't have to do that.\n\n264\n00:13:36.605 --> 00:13:39.505\nBonjour will help you find it if\nyou just use the individual name.\n\n265\n00:13:39.505 --> 00:13:40.870\nI can reach out and connect that way.\n\n266\n00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:44.480\nIt's going to connect and\nI have to authenticate.\n\n267\n00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.930\nSo I'll do that real quick, and\nnow it's giving me that list of folders.\n\n268\n00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.790\nSo I would have had it wrong,\nit's Don Pazette's Public Folder.\n\n269\n00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.350\nSo we can connect and\n\n270\n00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.090\nnow we're in business, so\nyeah those are all done with that UNC.\n\n271\n00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:58.450\nAll right, it's SMB: for well SMB.\n\n272\n00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.240\nAFP calling for AFP.\n\n273\n00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.580\nAnd it's HTTP when you do WebDAV, right?\n\n274\n00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.560\nThat would be the difference.\n\n275\n00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.530\nNow I didn't have WebDAV as an option here\nbecause the built in sharing on Mac OS\n\n276\n00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:09.980\ndoesn't use WebDAV, right?\n\n277\n00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.945\nSo if I go back in My system\npreferences on my server.\n\n278\n00:14:12.945 --> 00:14:17.275\nWhen I go into sharing,\nwhen I go in here, I only had AMP OR SMB.\n\n279\n00:14:17.275 --> 00:14:17.915\nNo Web DAV.\n\n280\n00:14:19.195 --> 00:14:23.545\nWeb DAV is actually\na function of the server app.\n\n281\n00:14:23.545 --> 00:14:25.825\nSo you've gotta have the server\napp to provide that functionality.\n\n282\n00:14:25.825 --> 00:14:32.060\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njust turn off our sharing here real quick.\n\n283\n00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.910\nSo I'm turning it off,\n\n284\n00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.760\ncuz I want to show you setting this\nup through the server instead, right.\n\n285\n00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.408\nSo I set it up here through the base OS.\n\n286\n00:14:39.408 --> 00:14:43.488\nEverything I showed you right there could\nbe done without the server app, but\n\n287\n00:14:43.488 --> 00:14:47.312\nif I have the server app, right,\nin the server app down in the left side,\n\n288\n00:14:47.312 --> 00:14:49.190\nyou'll find File Sharing.\n\n289\n00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:50.396\nIt's right there.\n\n290\n00:14:50.396 --> 00:14:52.110\nAnd we can come in and\nwe can turn on file sharing, and\n\n291\n00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.980\nin fact It's already turned on for me.\n\n292\n00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:58.930\nSee how it's on, and it's got\nDon Pezzet's public folder right there.\n\n293\n00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:02.680\nThe settings from the base OS,\nget brought in to the server app.\n\n294\n00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.300\nThey actually work together.\n\n295\n00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.620\nSo I'm going to turn this off.\n\n296\n00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.530\nSo it's turning it off again.\n\n297\n00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.390\nAnd I'm going back to my system\npreferences to make sure it's actually\n\n298\n00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.590\ngoing to turn off.\n\n299\n00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:17.670\nWhen you turn off file sharing, it gives\npeople time to save their documents and\n\n300\n00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:21.160\nend their connection and the smallest\ntime you can set it to is one minute.\n\n301\n00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.916\nSo now mine's kind of waiting for\nthis one minute to turn it off.\n\n302\n00:15:23.916 --> 00:15:27.554\nBut when I look here, I can see I don't\nhave a green dot by file sharing, so\n\n303\n00:15:27.554 --> 00:15:28.626\nit's not turned on.\n\n304\n00:15:28.626 --> 00:15:32.940\nAnd shortly in the system\npreferences here,\n\n305\n00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:38.830\nthis will turn off also if I just,\nI'm being impatient now.\n\n306\n00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:39.786\nThere we go, I can turn it off.\n\n307\n00:15:39.786 --> 00:15:41.481\nSo now it's off.\n\n308\n00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:45.521\nOkay, so back here, let's take a look\nat setting this up on the server.\n\n309\n00:15:45.521 --> 00:15:49.644\nNow on the server, there's two main\ntabs that we have here, settings and\n\n310\n00:15:49.644 --> 00:15:50.950\nconnected users.\n\n311\n00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.280\nYou can go to connected users and\nyou can see exactly who's connected and\n\n312\n00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.790\nwhat they're doing at any given time,\nright.\n\n313\n00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.860\nSo this is a great way to see how many\npeople are using my system right now.\n\n314\n00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.390\nI don't have any.\n\n315\n00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:05.670\nUnder settings, we can tailor permissions\nfor accessing the system, right.\n\n316\n00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.550\nNow we have permissions\non the other side too.\n\n317\n00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.020\nThat's not a big deal, right.\n\n318\n00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.260\nWell the permissions we saw a moment\nago were per folder, this is for\n\n319\n00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.740\nthe server as a whole.\n\n320\n00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.900\nI can pick what users and what networks\nare allowed to access this server as\n\n321\n00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.490\na whole regardless of what\nfolder they're going to.\n\n322\n00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.609\nSo that's kind of a nice more like\na global permission setting right there.\n\n323\n00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.900\nThen we've got Personal Folders.\n\n324\n00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.530\nThis is kind of neat.\n\n325\n00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.520\nCreate personal folders\nwhen users connect on iOS.\n\n326\n00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.460\nWhat's that all about?\n\n327\n00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.830\nWell, iOS devices can actually connect to\nan Apple server over file sharing, and\n\n328\n00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:37.470\nwhen that happens,\n\n329\n00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.420\nif we've got this turned on it will\ncreate a personal folder for them.\n\n330\n00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:45.140\nNormally, when a regular user connects, if\nthey're bound to the open directory they\n\n331\n00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.310\nmight have a home folder\nthat they can connect to.\n\n332\n00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.640\nBut iOS devices can't bind\nto your open directory, so\n\n333\n00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.650\nthey're not gonna have a home folder.\n\n334\n00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.620\nIf you want them to have one though,\nyou can choose this option, and\n\n335\n00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.660\neach iOS device will get its own folder.\n\n336\n00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.110\nIt sounds like a neat feature, but\nit's actually a pain in the butt.\n\n337\n00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.060\nLet me tell you why.\n\n338\n00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.710\nThe reason is it's tied to\nthe identity of the phone.\n\n339\n00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:08.780\nIf somebody gets a new phone, or a new\ntablet the identity is not the same, and\n\n340\n00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.250\nthey lose access to the folder, and now\nyou have to deal with changing that over.\n\n341\n00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:15.190\nSo, apple actually doesnt\nrecommend you use this.\n\n342\n00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:18.690\nInstead if you have mobile devices\nthat you want to have some kind of\n\n343\n00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.970\ncommon storage they should use icloud.\n\n344\n00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.360\nWith icloud its tied to their apple id.\n\n345\n00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.910\nAnd if they have one phone or ten phones,\n\n346\n00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.470\nif they get a new iPad\nit's all the same storage.\n\n347\n00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.270\nIt's not tied to the id of the phone.\n\n348\n00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.880\n>> Don you were mentioned,\nwith S and B traffic and\n\n349\n00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.860\nthe fact that we have Linux up.\n\n350\n00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.370\nInteroperability in Unix and\n\n351\n00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:40.600\nyou told us on many occasions\nthat the DNA of Mac here is BSD.\n\n352\n00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.310\nSo my question is, in nix-based systems,\nwe do have files and\n\n353\n00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:47.460\nfolders are case-sensitive, but\nin SNB traffic-based, and Windows,\n\n354\n00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.860\nthey're not case-sensitive.\n\n355\n00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.020\nCan that cause some kind of\ninteroperability problem?\n\n356\n00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:51.670\n>> It can.\n\n357\n00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:52.960\nA lot of it gets hidden.\n\n358\n00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.030\nSo, when you share a folder out,\nthere's actually two names for the folder,\n\n359\n00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.960\nthe original file system name,\nthen there's the shared folder name right?\n\n360\n00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.210\nSo if I have two folders that are just\noff by case, when I share them out,\n\n361\n00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.380\nI'll just have to give\nthe second one a different name.\n\n362\n00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.600\nSo that's kinda the way\nthat it corrects it.\n\n363\n00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.110\nBut the reality is with the standard\n\n364\n00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:18.170\nOS 10 extended journal file system\nformat It's not case sensitive.\n\n365\n00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.960\nEven though it's BSD under the hood,\nit's not case sensitive by default.\n\n366\n00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:26.050\nYou'd only have that problem if you\nformatted your drive as case sensitive,\n\n367\n00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:29.770\nthen it would be an issue, but\neven though we are based on BSD and\n\n368\n00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.800\nBSD is case sensitive by default,\nMac OS isn't,\n\n369\n00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.259\nthey've turned that off so\nit's not a problem.\n\n370\n00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.370\nSo when I look down here, the next\nthing I see are my shared folders and\n\n371\n00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:41.390\nsee how even Apple is\ncalling it a shared folder?\n\n372\n00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.600\nBut on the exam, you'll see shared point,\nso be ready for that.\n\n373\n00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.090\nBut here I can see my shared folders and\nI see Don Pezet's public folder and\n\n374\n00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:49.470\nif I wanna share something else out,\n\n375\n00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:51.590\nI can add it to the list,\nthen I can share it, right?\n\n376\n00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:56.150\nSo let's say that I have a,\nhere let me just go into my documents and\n\n377\n00:18:56.150 --> 00:19:01.050\nI'm gonna create a folder in here\ncalled Work Files, all right?\n\n378\n00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:04.300\nSo I've got this Work Files folder\nthat I want to share out, and so\n\n379\n00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.480\nI'm gonna come down here and\nI'm gonna add it to my Shared Folders.\n\n380\n00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:12.200\nSo I'm just gonna come in here and add\nWork Files and get that added to my list.\n\n381\n00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.570\nOkay, so there it is.\n\n382\n00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:18.380\nNow, technically,\nthe folder is in my Documents folder and\n\n383\n00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:23.280\nit's called Work Files, right, but here,\nthis is the shared folder name, and\n\n384\n00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.790\nthe shared folder name doesn't actually\nhave to match the folder underneath.\n\n385\n00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:27.820\nIt's more like a pointer,\n\n386\n00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.850\na share point, that points to\nsome other location on my drive.\n\n387\n00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:35.410\nBut the default is that it'll match\nthe name, that's kind of how that works.\n\n388\n00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:39.210\nAnd if I choose to edit that,\nyou'll see where I can change the name.\n\n389\n00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.210\nI can modify that name to\nbe something different, and\n\n390\n00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:45.270\nthat was how we resolved the case\nsensitivity issue Wes was asking about,\n\n391\n00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.740\nwe just have to give it a different name.\n\n392\n00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.000\nI might not want to call this work files,\nI might just want to call it work or\n\n393\n00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.980\nsomething.\n\n394\n00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.420\nHaving a space in the name\nmight be fine normally, but\n\n395\n00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.300\nit makes it hard when\nyou're typing in UNCs.\n\n396\n00:19:55.300 --> 00:20:00.060\nSo maybe I want to make this work-files or\nworkfiles with no space.\n\n397\n00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.760\nSo you can modify that as you see fit and\n\n398\n00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.320\nit doesn't have to match\nthe folder name under the hood.\n\n399\n00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.360\nThe other thing is look at the access,\nI've got SMB and\n\n400\n00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.300\nAFP, right, and iOS, right,\nthere's that other option.\n\n401\n00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.000\nAnd again, Apple puts it there so\nyou can use it but\n\n402\n00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.990\nthey really recommend\nyou use iCloud instead.\n\n403\n00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.100\nThe iCloud storage is\ndesigned to be far better for\n\n404\n00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.810\nmobile devices like this,\nb ut it is on by default.\n\n405\n00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.230\nThose are the three defaults.\n\n406\n00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:29.720\nThat's different than in the previous\nversions of the server app.\n\n407\n00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.480\nPrior to El Capitan it was just SMB and\nAFP by default.\n\n408\n00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.030\nRight now we have IOS added in so\nthat's a new feature.\n\n409\n00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.150\nWebDAV is right there,\n\n410\n00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:42.460\nthough I can turn on WebDAV and\nnow we'll have that available also.\n\n411\n00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:46.570\nWe didn't have that in the underlying OS,\nwe do have it here in the server app Don,\n\n412\n00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:51.620\nwhat if in that WorkFiles folder there,\nyou're storing your favorite Miley Cyrus\n\n413\n00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.740\nalbums and you don't want anybody to\nknow that when you're connecting and\n\n414\n00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.915\nbeing able to eavesdrop,\nis there a way we can protect that?\n\n415\n00:20:57.915 --> 00:21:00.968\n>> [LAUGH] My favorite albums, so\nyou mean the whole collection?\n\n416\n00:21:00.968 --> 00:21:01.472\n>> My bad.\n\n417\n00:21:01.472 --> 00:21:05.880\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well,\n>> AFP and SMB both support encryption.\n\n418\n00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.250\nThey both have that functionality\nbuilt right into them.\n\n419\n00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:09.120\nSo they can do it already.\n\n420\n00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.380\nI don't even have to do anything.\n\n421\n00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:16.000\nThe clients will determine that\non their own, but it's optional.\n\n422\n00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.710\nSo when a client connects the client\ncan choose to go encrypted or\n\n423\n00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:20.820\ncan choose not to.\n\n424\n00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.070\nRight?\n\n425\n00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.150\nBoth are supported.\n\n426\n00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:25.280\nIf it chooses not to\nthen just like West said.\n\n427\n00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:29.430\nSomebody could be sniffing on the network,\nand they can see me transferring these\n\n428\n00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.490\nfiles and they can get my\nwhole Miley Cyrus collection.\n\n429\n00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:34.240\nWhich I honestly don't think I've\never heard any of her music but\n\n430\n00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.320\nI'm sure it's phenomenal.\n\n431\n00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.570\nSo we don't necessarily want that to\nhappen so we want it to go encrypted.\n\n432\n00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:40.300\nWell the encryption's already supported,\nso\n\n433\n00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.070\nI don't have to configure anything, right?\n\n434\n00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.830\nWell, the only thing I really have\nto configure is this guy right here.\n\n435\n00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.000\nOnly allow encrypted connections.\n\n436\n00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.960\nIf I turn that on, now instead of\ngiving people the option, hey,\n\n437\n00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.840\nyou can encrypt, or\nyou can be unencrypted.\n\n438\n00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.430\nNow we can just say, look,\nyou connect encrypted or you get out and\n\n439\n00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.960\nthat's it, and that's gonna force my\nclients to encrypt their traffic.\n\n440\n00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.700\nTo the end user, what do they see?\n\n441\n00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.100\nNothing.\nIt's all kind of invisible to them.\n\n442\n00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.100\nThey just connect up like normal.\n\n443\n00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.800\nThey don't even realize it's encrypted.\n\n444\n00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.950\nBut now if somebody's\nsniffing on the network,\n\n445\n00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:12.200\nthey'll just capture that secured and\nencrypted traffic, all right?\n\n446\n00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.460\nWe also have the option to do guest users\nif we want to allow anonymous access.\n\n447\n00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:19.080\nRemember how each time I've connected\nto a I've had to provide credentials?\n\n448\n00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.880\nWell if I turn on guest user access,\nnow I won't have to deal with that, and\n\n449\n00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.160\nso, I can turn that on and\nI'll have guest user access.\n\n450\n00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.140\nThis last one here, home directors\nover SMB, it's grayed out for\n\n451\n00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.980\nme cuz I'm not running an open directory.\n\n452\n00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:37.170\nIf I had an open directory created, every\nuser would have a home directory, and\n\n453\n00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.340\nthe home directories\nare available by AFP by default.\n\n454\n00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:43.630\nWe can turn it on, and\nwe can choose whether its SMB or\n\n455\n00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.870\nAFP and\npick which way we want people to connect.\n\n456\n00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:49.220\nAnd now, when they fire up their\nmachines and log into the network,\n\n457\n00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.610\nthey'll be able to connect to their home\ndirectory automatically, and be available.\n\n458\n00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:54.599\nSo that's a nice feature if\nyou're using home directories.\n\n459\n00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:57.910\nAgain, you might not be using home\ndirectories if everybody's got\n\n460\n00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:58.750\niCloud accounts.\n\n461\n00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:02.000\nThen they might be using iCloud storage,\nand that's another option.\n\n462\n00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.220\nAll right,\nafter that we have our permissions,\n\n463\n00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.240\nand this is all on this individual folder.\n\n464\n00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.260\nSo each folder has its\nown different settings.\n\n465\n00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.720\nBut on this one I've got\nwhere I have read and\n\n466\n00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.160\nwrite, staff has read only,\neveryone else has read only.\n\n467\n00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.920\nI could come and start to tailor this.\n\n468\n00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:24.410\nNow, what we're looking at here are what\nare called the POSICS permissions.\n\n469\n00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:28.500\nIn BSD, in Unix, in the Unix world you\nhave POSICS permissions where every\n\n470\n00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.780\nfile in every folder has\nthree sets of permissions.\n\n471\n00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:36.605\nYou have the owner which is me cuz I\nmade the folder, you have the group,\n\n472\n00:23:36.605 --> 00:23:39.027\nwhich by default is gonna be Staff.\n\n473\n00:23:39.027 --> 00:23:41.361\nStaff is anybody who has a user\naccount on this computer.\n\n474\n00:23:41.361 --> 00:23:43.939\nAnd then you have everybody else.\n\n475\n00:23:43.939 --> 00:23:48.780\nIn Unix world It's called the user,\nthe group, and the other.\n\n476\n00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:53.920\nSo U, G, or I'm sorry, O, G, shoot,\nno, I had it right the first time.\n\n477\n00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.390\nU, G, O, right, user, group, other.\n\n478\n00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:57.990\nThat's in the Unix world.\n\n479\n00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:02.280\nIn Apple land, they call it owner,\ngroup, and everyone.\n\n480\n00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.180\nThese are standard Unix permissions.\n\n481\n00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.400\nBut I can add on to it.\n\n482\n00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.340\nIn Apple land we can create what's called\nan Access Control List, an ACL, where we\n\n483\n00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:15.580\nhave extended permissions that go beyond\nwhat Unix will normally let us have.\n\n484\n00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:20.220\nAnd so I can come in here and I can add,\nand I can add more stuff, other users.\n\n485\n00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:24.090\nSo if I had created a user account for\nWes, for example, I can come in here and\n\n486\n00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:24.830\nput Wes in.\n\n487\n00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.290\nNow I didn't create an account for\nhim, so it's not gonna let me do it.\n\n488\n00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:29.690\nBut that would be a second user.\n\n489\n00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:31.340\nAnd in Unix land you can't do that.\n\n490\n00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:35.960\nSo this ACL is now going to\nextend the POSIX permissions.\n\n491\n00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:41.700\nBe careful because the POSIX permissions\nand the ACL can conflict sometimes.\n\n492\n00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.820\nWe can have a difference between the\npermissions defined here in the sharing\n\n493\n00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.620\nwindow and\nthe permissions on the hard drive.\n\n494\n00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.470\nIf that happens, the ACL wins.\n\n495\n00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:51.720\nThe ACL wins over the POSIX permissions.\n\n496\n00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:55.440\nApple looks at the POSIX as the old way\nof doing things, so why let that win?\n\n497\n00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.230\nIt's gonna make the new way\nof doing it win, the ACLs.\n\n498\n00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:02.680\nSo If I want to, let me just cancel out of\nthis real quick, and let me go into Users,\n\n499\n00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.550\nand I'll just whip up a user account for\nWes real quick.\n\n500\n00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:10.750\nSo I'm gonna create an account for Wes,\nand just give you a simple password real\n\n501\n00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:13.760\nquick, and\nI can do the same thing with groups too.\n\n502\n00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.160\nSo here I'm creating a user account.\n\n503\n00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:19.490\nIf I create a group, same idea,\nso I might have a teachers group.\n\n504\n00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.080\nAnd now when I go back to File Sharing and\n\n505\n00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.930\nedit that Work Files,\nI can come in here and add.\n\n506\n00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:31.070\nAnd this time, there he is,\nI can add Wes Bryan to the list.\n\n507\n00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:36.280\nOr I can come in and\nI can add Teachers to the list.\n\n508\n00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.870\nAnd so now I have two groups and\ntwo users.\n\n509\n00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:41.240\nAnd Unix won't let me do that.\n\n510\n00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.056\nSo now I've got POSIX permissions\ncombined with an ACL.\n\n511\n00:25:45.056 --> 00:25:46.826\nThose two are gonna combine together and\n\n512\n00:25:46.826 --> 00:25:49.290\nnow I end up with this\nbigger set of permissions.\n\n513\n00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:53.070\nAnd if there's a conflict, the ACL wins.\n\n514\n00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:55.090\nIf I go and\nlook at this folder on the hard drive,\n\n515\n00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:57.220\nlet me just hit OK to save this.\n\n516\n00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.090\nSo you guys saw the permissions\nthat I just set right there.\n\n517\n00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:01.950\nSo I'm gonna save that.\n\n518\n00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.530\nAnd now, this is an important step.\n\n519\n00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.680\nI need to hit this On button right\nhere to turn on file sharing.\n\n520\n00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.346\nSo now I'm actually sharing.\n\n521\n00:26:08.346 --> 00:26:10.364\n[LAUGH] It's kind of a useful step there.\n\n522\n00:26:10.364 --> 00:26:11.790\nNow I'm gonna drop to my terminal.\n\n523\n00:26:12.825 --> 00:26:17.405\nAnd in my terminal I'm gonna go\nhunt down that folder, okay?\n\n524\n00:26:17.405 --> 00:26:22.705\nAnd when I hunt down that folder,\nwe're gonna see something interesting.\n\n525\n00:26:22.705 --> 00:26:26.522\nSo it was in my Documents and\nthere it is, Work Files.\n\n526\n00:26:26.522 --> 00:26:31.262\nAnd if I do an ls -la, there's Work Files.\n\n527\n00:26:31.262 --> 00:26:38.930\nAnd these right here, these are the Unix\npermissions, the POSIX permissions.\n\n528\n00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:43.930\nAnd so what I'm seeing are the owner,\nwhich is me, I get read,\n\n529\n00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:45.430\nwrite, and execute.\n\n530\n00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:51.520\nI see the group, which is staff,\nand staff gets read and execute.\n\n531\n00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.730\nAnd then the other, everyone else,\nthey get read and execute.\n\n532\n00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.330\nWhere's the rest of it?\n\n533\n00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.930\nWhere's the other permissions?\n\n534\n00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.480\nWell, they're in ACL,\nthey're stored separately.\n\n535\n00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.645\nAnd I know there's an ACL,\nthere's an extended set,\n\n536\n00:27:05.645 --> 00:27:06.925\nsee this little @ symbol here?\n\n537\n00:27:06.925 --> 00:27:10.528\nThat tells me there's more stuff than\nwhat's being shown on the screen here cuz\n\n538\n00:27:10.528 --> 00:27:11.614\nthis is the Unix world.\n\n539\n00:27:11.614 --> 00:27:14.120\nThe ls command that I'm\nusing is a Unix command.\n\n540\n00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.774\nAnd so I ran ls -la.\n\n541\n00:27:16.774 --> 00:27:20.238\n-l means show me the long\nform of the file listing.\n\n542\n00:27:20.238 --> 00:27:23.240\nAnd a means show me all files,\neven hidden ones.\n\n543\n00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.480\nSo I'm seeing everything\nthat's in that directory.\n\n544\n00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.964\nThere's more you can add, like la@, and\n\n545\n00:27:27.964 --> 00:27:31.280\nthe @ symbol says show me\nthe extended metadata.\n\n546\n00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.746\nAnd so I see additional metadata, but\nthat's not what I want, I want lae.\n\n547\n00:27:34.746 --> 00:27:38.350\nlae tells it to show me\nthe full access control list.\n\n548\n00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:41.770\nAnd so\nnow when I see Work Files right here,\n\n549\n00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:44.840\nlook at all this extra\nstuff after the Work Files.\n\n550\n00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:48.930\nI've got a user for spotlight, so\nthat spotlight can index the file.\n\n551\n00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:52.820\nI've got a user for wesbryan, and\nI've got a group for teachers.\n\n552\n00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:56.109\nThose permissions were\nstored separately in an ACL.\n\n553\n00:27:56.109 --> 00:27:57.706\nSo it's tracking those and\n\n554\n00:27:57.706 --> 00:28:01.676\nthose can be in conflict with\nthe POSIX permissions under the hood.\n\n555\n00:28:01.676 --> 00:28:03.840\nAnd if that's the case,\nthe ACL permissions win.\n\n556\n00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.670\nAll right, but at this point I have shared\nout that folder, I've got a SharePoint and\n\n557\n00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:13.780\nI've got several different protocols\navailable for people to connect to it.\n\n558\n00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:17.270\nAnd so because it's shared,\nI forgot to change the file name.\n\n559\n00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:20.177\nI'm gonna change it, I wanna call\nit WorkFiles without a space, so\n\n560\n00:28:20.177 --> 00:28:21.470\nI'm just gonna change that.\n\n561\n00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:24.060\nRight, so on the hard drive it's\nWork Files with a space, but\n\n562\n00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.040\nwhen I share it it's\nWorkFiles without a space.\n\n563\n00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.680\nAnd I'm doing that to make\nit easier to type in a UNC.\n\n564\n00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.080\nTyping in a UNC with a space in\nit's always really annoying.\n\n565\n00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:31.900\nYou've probably seen that,\n\n566\n00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.325\nlike you're browsing the web and\nthere's %20 in the URL.\n\n567\n00:28:35.325 --> 00:28:39.580\n%20 is like the ASCII code or\nwhatever that represents a white space.\n\n568\n00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:45.060\nSo now if I jump over to a client,\nI could browse on the Finder and\n\n569\n00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:49.810\nI could go into my shared servers and\nthere's the OS 10 server 01.\n\n570\n00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:54.320\nAnd I'm not seeing WorkFiles, right?\n\n571\n00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.970\nWell, I'm not seeing WorkFiles,\nthat's gonna be one of two things.\n\n572\n00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:58.942\nEither one, it just hasn't refreshed yet.\n\n573\n00:28:58.942 --> 00:29:01.150\nMacs are a little slow to\nrefresh on the network.\n\n574\n00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:04.126\nOr it might be that I didn't\nturn on guest access.\n\n575\n00:29:04.126 --> 00:29:06.720\nI can't remember if I checked that or\nnot, so let me authenticate real quick.\n\n576\n00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.012\nAnd that was the problem, yep.\n\n577\n00:29:09.012 --> 00:29:12.030\nSo I had checked it, but\nthen I canceled that window and\n\n578\n00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:13.760\nI must not have checked\nit back when I went back.\n\n579\n00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.155\nSo here's that WorkFiles, and\nsee how it doesn't have a space?\n\n580\n00:29:16.155 --> 00:29:19.680\nSo it doesn't have a space,\nbut I can browse into it, and\n\n581\n00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.120\nI guess it's empty so\nlet me throw something in there.\n\n582\n00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.870\nI'll throw a copy of iBooks.\n\n583\n00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.224\nSo we'll throw old iBooks in there.\n\n584\n00:29:27.224 --> 00:29:29.170\nSo there we go, so I'm copying up a file.\n\n585\n00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:32.271\nI'm allowed to copy to it because\nI'm logged in as Don Pezet and\n\n586\n00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:34.036\nI have full control of that folder.\n\n587\n00:29:34.036 --> 00:29:37.380\nI have read, write, and\nexecute, so it's copying over.\n\n588\n00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:41.473\nNow it never asked me if I wanted\nto use AFP or SMB, did it?\n\n589\n00:29:41.473 --> 00:29:46.301\nAnd if I jump back over here into my\nserver, I can go to Connected Users, and\n\n590\n00:29:46.301 --> 00:29:48.050\nwhat do I see?\n\n591\n00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:48.910\nNobody.\n\n592\n00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:51.110\nWell, the server app\ndoesn't refresh either.\n\n593\n00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:57.092\nSo a quick Cmd+R will refresh that screen,\nor you go up top to View > Refresh.\n\n594\n00:29:57.092 --> 00:30:00.808\nView > Refresh or Cmd+R,\nthat'll refresh the screen and\n\n595\n00:30:00.808 --> 00:30:05.428\nthere we can see dpezet is\nconnected from 192.168.0.150.\n\n596\n00:30:05.428 --> 00:30:07.270\nThat's my other Mac.\n\n597\n00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:12.490\nAnd I can see that I've been idle for\n0 minutes and I'm using SMB.\n\n598\n00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:15.960\nSo I'm on a Mac browsing to another Mac.\n\n599\n00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:21.036\nI've connected via the network,\nI just browsed to it and it used SMB.\n\n600\n00:30:21.036 --> 00:30:23.710\nI've got two Macs, maybe I wanna use AFP.\n\n601\n00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.280\nI can, but\nit just happened to default to SMB.\n\n602\n00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.280\nThat's how I'm connected right now.\n\n603\n00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.960\nSo if I wanna force AFP,\nI've got two choices.\n\n604\n00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.430\nChoice number one,\nI could disable SMB on the server.\n\n605\n00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:36.880\nRight, that'll certainly work.\n\n606\n00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:41.040\nChoice number two is I could\nuse a UNC to connect and\n\n607\n00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:44.200\nI could tell it to use AFP to do it.\n\n608\n00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.110\nSo those are two different ways that\nI could go about getting this done,\n\n609\n00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:48.290\nso let's do that.\n\n610\n00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:49.280\nI'm gonna go back over here.\n\n611\n00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.248\nThis is almost done copying, there we go.\n\n612\n00:30:51.248 --> 00:30:52.554\nAll right, so I'm gonna close that window.\n\n613\n00:30:52.554 --> 00:30:55.436\nNow just because I've closed the window\ndoesn't necessarily mean I've\n\n614\n00:30:55.436 --> 00:30:56.445\ndisconnected, right?\n\n615\n00:30:56.445 --> 00:31:00.130\nMacs usually stay connected to\na folder even after you close it,\n\n616\n00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.590\njust in case you wanna connect again.\n\n617\n00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:06.690\nSo sometimes you can drop into\nyour /volumes folder, and\n\n618\n00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:09.160\nyou'll see it still connected right there.\n\n619\n00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.797\nSo I am still connected, and if I fire up\nmy Finder, I'll probably see it over here\n\n620\n00:31:13.797 --> 00:31:17.514\nin my list, if I have that turned on,\nwhich apparently I don't.\n\n621\n00:31:17.514 --> 00:31:24.077\nSo see how OSX-SERVER01 here has\na little eject button by it?\n\n622\n00:31:24.077 --> 00:31:25.460\nSo I'm gonna disconnect.\n\n623\n00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.280\nI wanna make sure that I'm not\nconnected via SMB anymore, so\n\n624\n00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.630\nthat's gonna disconnect.\n\n625\n00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:34.520\nAnd over on the server I'm gonna refresh\nthis just to make sure my connection went\n\n626\n00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.030\naway, and it did.\n\n627\n00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:40.520\nAnd this time over on my Mac I'm gonna\nuse the Go menu and Connect to Server.\n\n628\n00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:47.104\nAnd when I connect, I'm gonna say\nafp:// and the name of the server.\n\n629\n00:31:47.104 --> 00:31:49.715\n/WorkFiles.\n\n630\n00:31:49.715 --> 00:31:56.798\nOkay, I'm gonna connect to a forcing\nAFP and this time when I go to connect,\n\n631\n00:31:56.798 --> 00:32:01.687\nit's gonna reach out and\nfind it [LAUGH] eventually.\n\n632\n00:32:01.687 --> 00:32:05.941\nAnd once it gets connected, it's probably\ngonna ask me for my credentials again.\n\n633\n00:32:05.941 --> 00:32:09.120\nAnd then I'll be able to access\nthat folder and browse to it.\n\n634\n00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.340\nNow it's taking a minute here.\n\n635\n00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.460\nI'll remove the .local from the name and\nso\n\n636\n00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:15.100\nBonjour is supposed to be\nfinding that server name.\n\n637\n00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.060\nApparently it's taking its time.\n\n638\n00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.720\nLet me just refresh this and\nmake sure I haven't actually connected.\n\n639\n00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.970\nI have not.\n\n640\n00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:22.440\nAnd I'm just gonna verify that.\n\n641\n00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:27.310\nRight, I didn't turn AFP off,\nif I remember right.\n\n642\n00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:28.257\nYeah, AFP is on, and\n\n643\n00:32:28.257 --> 00:32:31.283\nyou see there's the guest users\nthat I forgot to turn on something.\n\n644\n00:32:31.283 --> 00:32:32.908\nLet me turn that back on.\n\n645\n00:32:32.908 --> 00:32:34.400\nSo, let me turn that on.\n\n646\n00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:37.320\nThere we go, and back here, okay.\n\n647\n00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.487\nWe had a problem connecting,\nmore than likely name resolution, right?\n\n648\n00:32:40.487 --> 00:32:43.137\nI could try doing .local, but\nif I just wanna make sure I get there,\n\n649\n00:32:43.137 --> 00:32:45.620\ncuz I know I'm running a long time,\nI can punch in the IP.\n\n650\n00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:46.370\nSo let me do that.\n\n651\n00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:49.320\nSo, I'll punch in the IP to get connected.\n\n652\n00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.057\nThere we go.\n\n653\n00:32:50.057 --> 00:32:52.752\nAnd I can connect as a guest or\nI can connect as a registered user.\n\n654\n00:32:52.752 --> 00:32:54.719\nI do have an account,\nso I'll just do that.\n\n655\n00:32:56.310 --> 00:33:00.980\nAnd I'll connect up, and\nnow I'm connected, there's iBooks, right.\n\n656\n00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:05.440\nSo I'm connected into work files,\nI see the iBooks file that I copied over.\n\n657\n00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.140\nAnd if I jump back over to the server and\n\n658\n00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:11.240\ngo to my connected users,\nI can refresh that screen.\n\n659\n00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.050\nI see that I'm connected from my IP and\n\n660\n00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:16.790\nthis time I can see I did\nconnect with AFP, all right.\n\n661\n00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:18.750\nNow, that took the user\nmaking the decision.\n\n662\n00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:20.984\nWhen I connected,\nI had to choose to go AFP.\n\n663\n00:33:20.984 --> 00:33:23.540\nAre your end users going to think of that?\n\n664\n00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.540\nProbably not.\n\n665\n00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:28.023\nAnd so if that's the case you might be\nbetter off just turning off SMB and\n\n666\n00:33:28.023 --> 00:33:29.485\nsaying I just want to use AFP.\n\n667\n00:33:29.485 --> 00:33:33.360\nAll right, now what's the big\nadvantage in using AFP over SMB?\n\n668\n00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.219\nWas actually not a whole lot.\n\n669\n00:33:34.219 --> 00:33:37.027\nThey both perform pretty well,\nthey both provide encryption, and\n\n670\n00:33:37.027 --> 00:33:38.870\nthey both provide access to folders.\n\n671\n00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:43.030\nSMB gives you multi-vendor support,\nwhich is why Apple defaults to it.\n\n672\n00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:46.577\nAFP handles multiple file\nrevisions a little better.\n\n673\n00:33:46.577 --> 00:33:49.659\nSo you know how you have the quick\nsave features in OS X, so\n\n674\n00:33:49.659 --> 00:33:53.805\nas I start to modify a file,\nit saves previous versions of the file.\n\n675\n00:33:53.805 --> 00:33:55.485\nAFP does a really good job with that.\n\n676\n00:33:55.485 --> 00:33:59.063\nIf you're using SMB, SMB isn't aware\nof that functionality at all, and\n\n677\n00:33:59.063 --> 00:34:01.789\nso you start to lose a little\nbit of that functionality.\n\n678\n00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:04.680\nIt's a trade off that you make.\n\n679\n00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.310\nCompatibility versus feature set.\n\n680\n00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:09.670\nSo it's kinda up to you\nwhich one you wanna choose.\n\n681\n00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:11.772\nBut both are right there,\nthey're both turned on.\n\n682\n00:34:11.772 --> 00:34:15.180\nWeb DAV's the only one I didn't use,\nand you would just type in http:// and\n\n683\n00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:17.110\nbrowse and connect an app.\n\n684\n00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:19.150\nBut those are basically\nthe file sharing protocols.\n\n685\n00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:22.870\n>> Now, Don, I do realize looking at the\nclock we're a little bit short on time,\n\n686\n00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:24.780\nbut one of the last things\nI was thinking of is,\n\n687\n00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.150\nhow about things like\npermission inheritance?\n\n688\n00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:28.670\nIf I create a file or\n\n689\n00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:32.750\na folder inside of your work files folder,\nwhat permissions can I expect to see?\n\n690\n00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:35.390\n>> That's kind of a tricky one to answer,\n\n691\n00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:39.120\nso keep in mind when we're juggling\nthese different permissions, right?\n\n692\n00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.710\nSo we've seen when we got PosX permissions\nand we've got the ACL that OS X creates.\n\n693\n00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:46.300\nAnd we're sharing it out, so\nthere's the share permissions there.\n\n694\n00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.550\nYou have more than one level of\npermissions that are applying here.\n\n695\n00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:52.163\nAnd then as you start creating\nitems inside of a folder,\n\n696\n00:34:52.163 --> 00:34:56.071\ndepending on how you create them, their\npermissions could be set different ways.\n\n697\n00:34:56.071 --> 00:34:59.739\nIf you're moving a folder into\nanother folder, it'll actually retain\n\n698\n00:34:59.739 --> 00:35:03.115\nthe permissions that it had previously,\nwhich is a little weird.\n\n699\n00:35:03.115 --> 00:35:05.150\nBut if you're creating something all new,\n\n700\n00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.650\nthe permissions can end\nup a good bit different.\n\n701\n00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:12.320\nLet me just show a quick example before we\nwrap up, so you can kind of have an idea.\n\n702\n00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.210\nWe were talking about this\nwork files folder, right?\n\n703\n00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:19.834\nAnd if I do a quick get info on that, and\nwe'll take a look at the permissions on my\n\n704\n00:35:19.834 --> 00:35:24.527\nwork files folder, when I look at those\npermissions, I can see where Wes has read\n\n705\n00:35:24.527 --> 00:35:29.453\nand write, teachers have read and write,\nthere's me, the staff, and everyone.\n\n706\n00:35:29.453 --> 00:35:33.410\nRight, that's exactly what I saw on\nthe server app just a moment ago.\n\n707\n00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:34.590\nI'm seeing it right here in the OS,\n\n708\n00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:37.169\nthose are the permissions\nthat are set on that folder.\n\n709\n00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:42.598\nIf I browse into that folder and\nI'm gonna create a new folder in here, and\n\n710\n00:35:42.598 --> 00:35:45.310\nI'll just call it New Folder, right.\n\n711\n00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:46.926\nSo here's a new folder that I just made.\n\n712\n00:35:46.926 --> 00:35:53.520\nAnd when I pull up its permissions, you'll\nsee that it inherits the same permissions.\n\n713\n00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.610\nSo it's got the same permissions\nas the parent folder.\n\n714\n00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:58.266\nWhen you create something new in there,\nit makes sense that, hey,\n\n715\n00:35:58.266 --> 00:35:59.858\nwe want it to have the same permissions.\n\n716\n00:35:59.858 --> 00:36:02.760\nYou can override them,\nit doesn't have to inherit, right?\n\n717\n00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:06.600\nIf I unlock this,\nlet me just unlock it real quick.\n\n718\n00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.220\nAnd once it's unlocked I can go in, and\n\n719\n00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.730\nI can say well,\nyeah I wanted Wes to have read and\n\n720\n00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:15.180\nwrite on the main folder, but on this one,\nI want him to be read only, right?\n\n721\n00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:19.720\nAnd teachers, I really don't want teachers\nto have access to this at all, right?\n\n722\n00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.560\nNow I've broken inheritance\non this folder.\n\n723\n00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.298\nThe subfolder has different\npermissions than the parent,\n\n724\n00:36:25.298 --> 00:36:28.264\nby default they don't have the same\npermissions of the parent.\n\n725\n00:36:28.264 --> 00:36:29.815\nBut you can override these and\n\n726\n00:36:29.815 --> 00:36:33.130\nthis will apply to people\naccessing over the network.\n\n727\n00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:35.010\nSo if Wes was were to access\nthis over the network,\n\n728\n00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:37.650\non the parent folder he\nwould have read and write,\n\n729\n00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:42.170\nand then as soon as he browsed into this\nnew folder, he would just have read only.\n\n730\n00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:44.220\nI've broken the inheritance, right?\n\n731\n00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.100\nThe only time this gets really tricky,\ncuz so\n\n732\n00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.110\nfar I think everything\nI've said makes sense.\n\n733\n00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:50.420\nI mean it works the way\nyou'd expect it to work.\n\n734\n00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.210\nThe only part where it\ngets a little quirky and\n\n735\n00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:56.170\nweird, is when you move folders\nfrom one place to another.\n\n736\n00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:57.824\nSo now that I've changed that one,\n\n737\n00:36:57.824 --> 00:37:00.703\nlet me create another folder\nover here on my desktop, right.\n\n738\n00:37:00.703 --> 00:37:04.303\nSo I'm gonna make a new\nfolder here on my desktop,\n\n739\n00:37:04.303 --> 00:37:07.330\nwhich I might call Research, all right.\n\n740\n00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:11.999\nAnd so this is gonna be my Research folder\nand let me just unlock my permissions.\n\n741\n00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:18.027\nAnd see how it's me, staff,\neveryone, right, and that's it,\n\n742\n00:37:18.027 --> 00:37:20.636\nthat's the default for my desktop.\n\n743\n00:37:20.636 --> 00:37:23.987\nAnd I'm gonna take staff and I'll make\nstaff, actually I'll leave staff read\n\n744\n00:37:23.987 --> 00:37:27.080\nonly, and I'm gonna take everyone and\ngive them no access.\n\n745\n00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.920\nOkay, so everyone no access, staff read\nonly, me, I can do whatever I want.\n\n746\n00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:34.390\nThat's how this folder is, all right,\nsitting right on my desktop.\n\n747\n00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:39.955\nWhen I take that folder and I move it,\nso I'm gonna move it into Work Files.\n\n748\n00:37:39.955 --> 00:37:41.325\nWork Files,\n\n749\n00:37:41.325 --> 00:37:46.165\nwe saw just a moment ago that Work Files\nhave a lot of permissions on it.\n\n750\n00:37:46.165 --> 00:37:49.955\nIt's got, Wes has read and write,\nteachers read and write, me read and\n\n751\n00:37:49.955 --> 00:37:53.285\nwrite, staff has read only,\neveryone has read only.\n\n752\n00:37:53.285 --> 00:37:57.315\nIf I take a look at the new folder,\nResearch, and\n\n753\n00:37:57.315 --> 00:38:00.120\nI pull it up, look at what it has.\n\n754\n00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.430\nIt did not inherit\nthe permissions of the parent.\n\n755\n00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:07.510\nIt kept me with read and write,\nstaff read only, everyone else no access.\n\n756\n00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:10.260\nSo, if you make a new folder or\n\n757\n00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:14.570\nyou make a new file, it'll inherit the\npermissions of the folder you put it in.\n\n758\n00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:17.210\nSo those are gonna stay the same.\n\n759\n00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:21.571\nBut if you move a file into there,\nthen it's gonna change.\n\n760\n00:38:21.571 --> 00:38:24.372\nThen it's gonna change and,\nwell it doesn't change,\n\n761\n00:38:24.372 --> 00:38:26.610\nthe folder permission kinda change.\n\n762\n00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:30.200\nThe source file will retain\nthe permissions that it had\n\n763\n00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.630\nfrom where it came from, right?\n\n764\n00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:32.690\nSo that doesn't change.\n\n765\n00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:35.530\nThe exception is if you're coming\nfrom like removable media or\n\n766\n00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.070\na separate hard drive,\ncuz then when you move,\n\n767\n00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:42.400\nyou're technically creating a new file\non this drive, and then it will inherit.\n\n768\n00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.935\nAnd that's where it really gets weird,\nright,\n\n769\n00:38:43.935 --> 00:38:45.404\nnow permissions are going\nall over the place.\n\n770\n00:38:45.404 --> 00:38:48.296\nSo it's a good idea that if\nyou're creating something new,\n\n771\n00:38:48.296 --> 00:38:51.811\nyou don't worry about it, but\nany time you move something into a folder,\n\n772\n00:38:51.811 --> 00:38:53.700\ndouble check the permissions.\n\n773\n00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.420\nDouble check to make sure it ended up\nwith the permissions that you expected it\n\n774\n00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.210\nto have.\n\n775\n00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:00.510\nCuz if I leave it like this,\nI might know, hey Wes has read and\n\n776\n00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:01.640\nwrite to the Work Files folder.\n\n777\n00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.320\nI'm gonna put this in here and\nhe'll have access, right?\n\n778\n00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:09.280\nWell no, he doesn't have access because\nonly me and, well a staff has read only,\n\n779\n00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.350\nI guess Wes would be in staff so\nyou'd have read only, but\n\n780\n00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:12.510\nyou wouldn't have read write.\n\n781\n00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:15.030\nWes wouldn't have the permissions I\nexpected him to because of the way\n\n782\n00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.770\ninheritance was handled.\n\n783\n00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:19.190\nSo just be aware that's a little bit of a\npitfall that you can kinda step into when\n\n784\n00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.889\nyou're dealing with shared folders.\n\n785\n00:39:20.889 --> 00:39:22.943\n>> Well Don, thank you for\nall that great information.\n\n786\n00:39:22.943 --> 00:39:26.042\nAnd hopefully you know a little\nbit more about file sharing,\n\n787\n00:39:26.042 --> 00:39:27.700\nthe wonderful topic that it is.\n\n788\n00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:28.810\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\n\n789\n00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:31.060\nit does look like we're coming\nto the end another episode.\n\n790\n00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.063\nSo we're gonna take this time\nto sign out for ITProTV.\n\n791\n00:39:33.063 --> 00:39:34.364\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n792\n00:39:34.364 --> 00:39:35.420\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n793\n00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.867\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n794\n00:39:37.867 --> 00:39:43.708\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.080\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\n\n4\n00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.610\nin today's episode we're moving\nthrough our OS X server essentials.\n\n5\n00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.870\nAnd we're getting into implementing\ndeployment solutions, and\n\n6\n00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.610\nmore specifically,\na topic known as the caching server.\n\n7\n00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.550\nHelping us out with the caching server\nis none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.940\nDon, how you doing today, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:32.800\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.710\nReady to dive right into\nthe caching service.\n\n11\n00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.380\nAnd for\nthose of you that aren't familiar with it,\n\n12\n00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.430\nthe caching service actually a neat little\nsystem that's a part of the server app.\n\n13\n00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.870\nIs designed to make it where you can\nmore quickly distribute files and\n\n14\n00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.480\nupdates across your Mac while using\nthe minimal amount of bandwidth possible.\n\n15\n00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.730\nThis is great in areas where you\ndon't have a giant WAN link or\n\n16\n00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.470\nyou just have a ton of Macs and you want\nthings to be a little more efficient.\n\n17\n00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.380\nThe caching service works really well for\nthat.\n\n18\n00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.630\nSo that's what we're gonna be diving\ninto right here in this episode.\n\n19\n00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.270\n>> So Don, when we look at the caching\nserver, I've got my server app it's open,\n\n20\n00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.170\nit's ready to go.\n\n21\n00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.760\nI need to do some configuring,\nyou're gonna help us out with that.\n\n22\n00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.790\nHow do we configure it?\n\n23\n00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.180\n>> All right, this is my favorite one.\n\n24\n00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.521\nOut of all the stuff in this show,\nthe caching server literally,\n\n25\n00:01:12.521 --> 00:01:14.486\nthere's an on switch and that's it.\n\n26\n00:01:14.486 --> 00:01:17.806\nLike everything else that we've seen in\nthis series, you gotta do configurations,\n\n27\n00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:19.526\nyou got all these options to turn on and\noff.\n\n28\n00:01:19.526 --> 00:01:22.250\nThe caching server,\nwe just flip an on switch.\n\n29\n00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.310\nSo it's super simple to configure.\n\n30\n00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.550\nApple wanted to make this one\nas easy to deploy as possible.\n\n31\n00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.300\nIn fact,\nthere really just isn't much to it.\n\n32\n00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.200\nBut let's talk a little\nbit about how it works and\n\n33\n00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.780\nwhat it does to make sure\nyour deploying it correctly.\n\n34\n00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.440\nAnd you might be asking what do I need?\n\n35\n00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.430\nIf it's just on switch,\nhow can you deploy it incorrectly?\n\n36\n00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.820\nWell, we have a slight thing\nthat we need to be aware of,\n\n37\n00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.120\na big gotcha that kind of sits out there.\n\n38\n00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.690\nWhich is that the caching\nserver is not compatible\n\n39\n00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.110\nwith the software update server.\n\n40\n00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.070\nNow, we're going to talk about the\nsoftware update server in our next episode\n\n41\n00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.900\nand get a look at in how it works.\n\n42\n00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.200\nBut the two of them\nare mutually exclusive.\n\n43\n00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.030\nYou can have one or\nthe other you can't have both.\n\n44\n00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.150\nBecause both of them provide\nthe ability to distribute updates.\n\n45\n00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.400\nThe caching server.\n\n46\n00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.920\nWhat happens with the caching server\nis when there's an update available,\n\n47\n00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.560\none of the Macs on your network\nis gonna find that update.\n\n48\n00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.610\nIt's gonna reach out to Apple,\n\n49\n00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.510\nApple's gonna say hey look I've\ngot a new update for you, and\n\n50\n00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.240\nthe Mac's gonna download it.\n\n51\n00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.120\nWhen that Mac downloads it,\nif it's connected to a caching server,\n\n52\n00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.660\na copy of the update will be\nstored on the caching server.\n\n53\n00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.340\nFrom then on, if any other Mac\ngoes to download that update,\n\n54\n00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.830\nit'll just get it from the caching server.\n\n55\n00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.060\nInstead of going out to the Internet.\n\n56\n00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.720\nNow, if you just have five Macs.\n\n57\n00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.030\nIs that a big deal?\n\n58\n00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.160\nIt really isn't.\n\n59\n00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.720\nHere in the studio.\n\n60\n00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.840\nHow many Macs do we even have around here,\nWes?\n\n61\n00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.400\nWe probably have-\n>> 10, 15.\n\n62\n00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.440\n>> Yeah, 10 or 15 of them, right?\n\n63\n00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.470\nSo, not a ton.\n\n64\n00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.940\nBut we've probably got 10 or\n15 Macs here in the studios.\n\n65\n00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.650\nAnd so, for us,\nwe don't have a caching server.\n\n66\n00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.700\nWe've got 10 or 15 Macs.\n\n67\n00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.625\nIf we need to download an update,\nwe download it 10 or 15 times and\n\n68\n00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:53.765\nthen that's it.\n\n69\n00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:58.825\nBut imagine if you had 2,000 Macs and\nyou're about to download\n\n70\n00:02:58.825 --> 00:03:02.885\nthe El Capitan installer or\nany of the El Capitan updates.\n\n71\n00:03:02.885 --> 00:03:05.950\nThe El Capitan updates\nare a good 800 to 900 megs each.\n\n72\n00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.790\nIf you have 1,000 Macs that's a lot of\nbandwidth you're gonna eat up downloading\n\n73\n00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.630\nthe same update over and\nover and over and over again.\n\n74\n00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.050\nSo, it makes sense to deploy\na caching server on the network.\n\n75\n00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.920\nIf you have a caching server,\none person will download the update and\n\n76\n00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.420\nonce they've downloaded, it everybody\nelse just gets the update right from that\n\n77\n00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.890\nlocal server instead of\nreaching all the way to Apple.\n\n78\n00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.720\nSo, two things happen.\n\n79\n00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.820\nOne you use less Internet bandwidth,\nright.\n\n80\n00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.870\nSo if you have a data cap or\nwhatever it helps.\n\n81\n00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.090\nMost of us don't have data caps though.\n\n82\n00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.155\nSo it's just kinda\nminimizing that bandwidth.\n\n83\n00:03:36.155 --> 00:03:40.075\nAnd the second thing is you're\ngonna get the update faster.\n\n84\n00:03:40.075 --> 00:03:40.935\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\n85\n00:03:40.935 --> 00:03:43.205\nWell, what's your Internet bandwidth?\n\n86\n00:03:43.205 --> 00:03:47.765\nHere in our building, we have fiber\noptic Internet, and it's 80 megabit.\n\n87\n00:03:47.765 --> 00:03:50.435\nSo we have 80 megs of Internet bandwidth,\nand that's pretty good.\n\n88\n00:03:50.435 --> 00:03:53.145\nA lot of people have far,\nfar worse connections than that.\n\n89\n00:03:53.145 --> 00:03:53.915\nWe have 80 megabits.\n\n90\n00:03:53.915 --> 00:03:56.235\nSo if we go and download it,\nthat's what we're gonna download it at.\n\n91\n00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:57.495\nThat sounds great.\n\n92\n00:03:57.495 --> 00:04:01.625\nBut, if the update is sitting on\na server here on my local network,\n\n93\n00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:04.710\nour local network is gigabit, right.\n\n94\n00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.620\nGigabit, it's over ten times the bandwidth\nof that 80 meg Internet connection.\n\n95\n00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.910\nIt's a significant speed improvement.\n\n96\n00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.190\nSo we can download the update\nfrom a caching server way faster\n\n97\n00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.470\nthan we can download it\nfrom Apple servers itself,\n\n98\n00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.430\neven though we've got a great\nInternet connection, all right.\n\n99\n00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.640\nSo, that's another advantage of the\ncaching servers that it can push updates\n\n100\n00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.370\nfar, far faster.\n\n101\n00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.060\nNow, why is it not compatible\nwith the software update server?\n\n102\n00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.280\nWell the reason is,\n\n103\n00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.350\non the software update server,\nyou can download updates from Apple.\n\n104\n00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.520\nAnd you can distribute the updates\nout to your own clients right from\n\n105\n00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.830\na central machine.\n\n106\n00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.240\nThe big difference is on the software\nupdate server, you can approve and\n\n107\n00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.490\ndeny updates.\n\n108\n00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.240\nYou can enable and disable updates.\n\n109\n00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.890\nSo let's say that a new\nversion of Safari comes out.\n\n110\n00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.150\nAnd you have an application that doesn't\nwork in the newest version of Safari.\n\n111\n00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.810\nYou can go in the software update server\nand you can say disable that update.\n\n112\n00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.250\nAnd now the Safari update won't\npush out to your work stations or\n\n113\n00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.180\nnew iTunes or something like\nthat you can block things or\n\n114\n00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.860\nyou can approve things you can do\nthat often software update server.\n\n115\n00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.710\nOn a caching server you can't.\n\n116\n00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.040\nOn a caching server it's just caching.\n\n117\n00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.680\nPeople can do whatever\nupdate they want and\n\n118\n00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.670\nit's gonna get cached and\nit's gonna be distributed.\n\n119\n00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.650\nYou have no control over saying yes or\nno to an update.\n\n120\n00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.890\nSo if you want control,\nyou gotta go software update.\n\n121\n00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.920\nIf you don't want control,\nyou can go caching.\n\n122\n00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.110\nWell, in my world that's a no-brainer.\n\n123\n00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.770\nI'm just gonna go software update then.\n\n124\n00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.080\nI'd rather have that control then\nnot have it and there we go.\n\n125\n00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.140\nBut, there's a nice little feature\nabout the caching server I\n\n126\n00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.400\nhaven't mentioned yet.\n\n127\n00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.100\nAnd that is it can cache a lot\nmore than just updates, right?\n\n128\n00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.510\nUpdates are the main thing, right?\n\n129\n00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.490\nBut it can also cache things like anything\nyou've purchased to the App Store, right?\n\n130\n00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.750\nAll the apps in the Mac app\nstore it can cache those.\n\n131\n00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.650\nAll the updates I've already mentioned.\n\n132\n00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.320\nAny books that you've\npurchased through iBooks.\n\n133\n00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.090\nAny volume purchase program\nstuff from iBooks and\n\n134\n00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.980\nthe App Store it can cache those too.\n\n135\n00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.250\nIt can cache\nthe Internet Recovery Partition.\n\n136\n00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.440\nThat's a cool one, right?\n\n137\n00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.850\nWhen you boot your Mac and\nthe hard drive's completely wiped and\n\n138\n00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.150\nyou do Internet recovery, it's gonna\ndownload that from Apple's servers,\n\n139\n00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.110\nit's 700 megs, it takes a little while.\n\n140\n00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.260\nWell your caching server can cache\nthe entire Internet recovery partition.\n\n141\n00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.860\nAnd now when you boot a Mac,\n\n142\n00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.270\nit's gonna boot off of that local\ncopy of the Internet recovery.\n\n143\n00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.990\nIt's a pretty sweet feature right there,\nso makes troubleshooting go a lot faster.\n\n144\n00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.900\nSame thing with Apple TV updates we\ncan go beyond what we have in just our\n\n145\n00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.860\nregular systems.\n\n146\n00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.560\nSo it's really neat stuff.\n\n147\n00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.130\n>> Don, when it comes to deploying your\ncaching server here are we talking\n\n148\n00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.790\nabout taking astronomical\nreadings Geological surveys.\n\n149\n00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.840\nWhen it comes to the deployment here,\nhow complex is it?\n\n150\n00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.330\n>> It's really the simplest one\nto turn on, imaginable, right.\n\n151\n00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.050\nIn fact, let me show you.\n\n152\n00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.180\nCuz I can talk about this stuff but then\nseeing it in action is a different story.\n\n153\n00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.860\nSo I'm gonna connect to my server here.\n\n154\n00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.670\nAnd let's say that I want this\nserver to be a caching server, okay.\n\n155\n00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.960\nSo, first I'm gonna download\nall my documentation so\n\n156\n00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.910\nI can redo my steps, right.\n\n157\n00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.360\nWell not really on this one.\n\n158\n00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.430\nOn this one, we can go in to our server\napp, you can go over here to services and\n\n159\n00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.890\nfind caching.\n\n160\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.320\nAnd on the caching screen,\nyou can hit the on button.\n\n161\n00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.610\nAnd now you are a caching server.\n\n162\n00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.480\nJust like that it's done and\nyou are caching, okay.\n\n163\n00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.100\nThere are actually a couple of options\nright in here that we can tweak, but\n\n164\n00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.670\nby default if you just turn it on you\nare caching server in your business.\n\n165\n00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.550\nOkay, so\nwhat are some of this other options.\n\n166\n00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.360\nWell, if you look at it\nthere is permissions, right.\n\n167\n00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.850\nThe default is it's only\nset to local subnet.\n\n168\n00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.689\nIn other words, if somebody is out there\non the Internet you don't wanna cache for\n\n169\n00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:37.010\nthem they're in the Internet,\nthey can just go to Apple, right?\n\n170\n00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.283\nBut if they're local, if they're in your\nbuilding, you wanna provide a cache for\n\n171\n00:07:40.283 --> 00:07:42.100\nthem and that's the default.\n\n172\n00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.780\nYou can adjust that if you want or\nyou can leave like it is right here..\n\n173\n00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.370\nAnd it will just do it for\nall of your local networks.\n\n174\n00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.260\nThen the cache location.\n\n175\n00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.114\nThis is probably the only\none you wanna change, right?\n\n176\n00:07:53.114 --> 00:07:57.564\nIf you look at my system, if I go back up\nto my server here, and I go to storage,\n\n177\n00:07:57.564 --> 00:08:01.875\nI have one hard drive And its got 30\ngigs of storage available, right, so\n\n178\n00:08:01.875 --> 00:08:03.596\nits not a very big harddrive.\n\n179\n00:08:03.596 --> 00:08:07.373\nWell, that means I can only store\nlike 30 gigs of cached files and\n\n180\n00:08:07.373 --> 00:08:12.370\nwhen I fill that up it's filling up\nthe same harddrive as my operating system.\n\n181\n00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.520\nSo what would be better is if\nI added a second harddrive\n\n182\n00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.310\njust to be the cache, right.\n\n183\n00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.260\nOr even just a separate partition to keep\nit isolated from the operating system but\n\n184\n00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.440\na separate drive to store the cache,\nthe bigger the better.\n\n185\n00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.530\nA lot of people will use Thunderbolt or\nUSB 3 external drives,\n\n186\n00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.390\ncuz you can stick a 2 TB drive on\na system really easy that way,\n\n187\n00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.810\nand it's just caching, so\nyou're passing it over the network.\n\n188\n00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:40.020\nA USB 3 drive will work just fine for\nthat, it actually does a really good job.\n\n189\n00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.340\nSo you might wanna change that.\n\n190\n00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.530\nSo under the caching server,\nyou can change that location.\n\n191\n00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:49.580\nI recommend you change those\nsooner than later, right?\n\n192\n00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.470\nBecause, if your caching\ndrive is full of data and\n\n193\n00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.760\nyou move the storage it's got to copy all\nthat data, and that can take a while.\n\n194\n00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.730\nSo you got two options on that.\n\n195\n00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.320\nIf the drive is already full,\nif it's already cached a bunch of data and\n\n196\n00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.400\nyou wanna move it you can go ahead and hit\nChange Location, it'll copy it all over.\n\n197\n00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.240\nOr right down here you've\ngot a reset button.\n\n198\n00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.160\nNow when you hit that reset button\nit empties your cash, and so\n\n199\n00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.700\nthen you can move it and it just takes\na second because it's empty, but\n\n200\n00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.770\nnow it's got to re-download stuff\nfrom anybody who's out there, so\n\n201\n00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.840\nthe next time somebody accesses\nan update or whatever.\n\n202\n00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.980\nThey're gonna download it again and\nit will get reached.\n\n203\n00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.030\nSo it will kinda rebuild itself over time.\n\n204\n00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.440\nThe reality is you could\ndelete your entire cache, and\n\n205\n00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.860\nyou'll be all right it's just people\nhave to go back out to the internet and\n\n206\n00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.150\ndownload things that first time.\n\n207\n00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.700\nSo the next person to download it is\ngonna be a little bit slower, and\n\n208\n00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.230\nI say it's a little bit slower,\nit's gonna be normal.\n\n209\n00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.720\nIt's not gonna be faster like it will\nbe for most people the second time or\n\n210\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.150\non repeat downloads, but\nyou can easily see that.\n\n211\n00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:48.280\nIf you're going to share the same\ndrive as your operating system\n\n212\n00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.870\nyou probably need to set\na maximum cache size.\n\n213\n00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.780\nI don't want the cache to be able to fill\nup the hard drive and not leave enough\n\n214\n00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.950\nroom for my operating system, so\nI might want to shrink that down.\n\n215\n00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:02.830\nThe minimum space is 25 gigs, okay,\nif you have less than 25 gigs it doesn't\n\n216\n00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:07.220\neven bother with the caching remember that\nmost operating system updates these days\n\n217\n00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.640\nweigh in at close to a gig, and\nI didn't mention it, I probably should've.\n\n218\n00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:17.460\nWhen we do caching, it's not just for\nMac OS, it'll also cache for iOS devices.\n\n219\n00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.020\nSo if you have iPads and iPhones,\nit'll cache their updates too,\n\n220\n00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:26.960\nincluding their operating system updates,\nand those are always over a gig in size.\n\n221\n00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.700\nApps these days, I gotta a number of\napps that are well over in gig in size,\n\n222\n00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.050\nsome of are 3 or even 4 gigs in size.\n\n223\n00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.300\nI know I have a little astronomy app\nthat shows like all the constellations,\n\n224\n00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.370\nthat things like 2 gigs.\n\n225\n00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:41.610\nSo, 25 gigs is really not\na lot in the world of caching.\n\n226\n00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.400\nYou'll probably going to want more.\n\n227\n00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.700\nThe more the better, but the default\nvalue is unlimited, and if you're sharing\n\n228\n00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.340\nthe same job as your operating system,\nyou could get so much stuff in your cache\n\n229\n00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.900\nthat the operating system doesn't\nhave room to breathe anymore.\n\n230\n00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.140\nThe caging file for the operating\nsystem won't be able to grow,\n\n231\n00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.580\nand it can start to cause\ninstability on your system.\n\n232\n00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.670\nSo, either set a artificial\nlimit like I'm doing here, or\n\n233\n00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:07.530\nmake sure that you put it\non its own drive, right?\n\n234\n00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.410\nThose are the only configuration options\nwe have, and they're all optional.\n\n235\n00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.680\nWe don't have to set any of those.\n\n236\n00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.960\nI could have just hit On, and\nI'd already be set up, and\n\n237\n00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.610\nin fact that's kind of how I am.\n\n238\n00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:20.110\nI'm now a caching server and\nI'm up and running, okay.\n\n239\n00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.200\nNow, Cache Used, None,\nI haven't cached a darned thing.\n\n240\n00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.960\nSo I need to see something,\nI need to download an update or\n\n241\n00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.360\nsomething like that to actually\nsee this in action, all right.\n\n242\n00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:35.870\nSo I need to go to a client and do\nsomething to trigger this caching, right.\n\n243\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.660\nSo I've got a client sitting right here,\nand\n\n244\n00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.820\nthis client has some updates\nthat it hasn't done yet, okay?\n\n245\n00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:47.670\nSo what do I need to do here on the client\nto get a sub to use the caching server,\n\n246\n00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.030\nthis is the best part, nothing.\n\n247\n00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:54.530\nYour Macs, your iPhones,\nyour iPads, all the OS 10 and\n\n248\n00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:58.260\niOS devices, Will automatically\nfind the caching server.\n\n249\n00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.250\nYou don't have to set it up at all.\n\n250\n00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.410\nThey can see it with Bonjour.\n\n251\n00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:04.520\nThey can spot that caching server and\nthey know it's there and\n\n252\n00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.850\nthey use it automatically.\n\n253\n00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.940\nYou do absolutely nothing on the client.\n\n254\n00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.180\nThat means you can even have\nguests come on your network where\n\n255\n00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.610\nthey're not bound to your open directory.\n\n256\n00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.860\nYou don't have control of their system,\nand they'll use your caching server too\n\n257\n00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.890\nto share those resources, and\nthat way it minimizes your bandwidth.\n\n258\n00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.710\nSo, I don't have to change anything here.\n\n259\n00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:24.750\nI can fire up the App Store,\nand I can go to my Updates tab,\n\n260\n00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:28.700\nwhere it's gonna find some updates,\nand let's just get in here.\n\n261\n00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.700\nWe're checking for some updates.\n\n262\n00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.000\nI'm gonna use Updates as an example.\n\n263\n00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.100\nIf I did iBooks and downloaded a book, or\nif I download an app from the App Store,\n\n264\n00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.210\nthey would all trigger this, too.\n\n265\n00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:41.360\nThat's all kind of a part of it,\nbut updates are the easiest one for\n\n266\n00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.480\nme to do without having to buy anything.\n\n267\n00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.220\nSo it's gonna check for updates.\n\n268\n00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.460\nI should have two updates.\n\n269\n00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.670\nI know this one I'm still running 10.11.3\nand 10.11.4 is out so that's a big one.\n\n270\n00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.480\nAnd then I believe there's\na video camera update too.\n\n271\n00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.250\nAnd I guess I'm wrong on\nthe video camera update.\n\n272\n00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:02.680\nAll right, so there's just the, nope,\nthere it is, if I break it open.\n\n273\n00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.280\nSo I've got a digital camera update,\nI've got an iTunes update, and\n\n274\n00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.050\nI've got the 10.11.4 update.\n\n275\n00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:11.280\nI'm gonna start with the digital camera\nupdate cuz it's small [LAUGH], and\n\n276\n00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.250\nso it's 7.8 megabites in size.\n\n277\n00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:18.290\nSo really small, we can get that installed\nand updated, then we got iTunes 12.3.\n\n278\n00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.970\nThat ones gonna be a little\nbit bigger I'm sure.\n\n279\n00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.310\nSo I'm going and start that one too.\n\n280\n00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.100\nIt is 169 MB, right.\n\n281\n00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:31.000\nNow what's gonna happen is my machine\nalready knows about the caching server.\n\n282\n00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.540\nSo it's gonna ask the caching server,\nhey do you have a copy of this file?\n\n283\n00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.430\nAnd the caching server's gonna say no.\n\n284\n00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:36.980\nAnd so we'll zero it, we'll forget you.\n\n285\n00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.180\nWe'll just get it from Apple.\n\n286\n00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.330\nAnd so\nI'm downloading it from Apple right now.\n\n287\n00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:45.600\nBut the whole time the cashing server is\nsaying, let me have a copy of that too.\n\n288\n00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.230\nAnd so we're sharing it, right?\n\n289\n00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:50.140\nIt's actually the casing server that's\ndownloading it and giving it to me.\n\n290\n00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.720\nSo I don't necessarily see\nthat I'm connecting to Apple,\n\n291\n00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.220\nI see that I'm connecting\nto the cashing server.\n\n292\n00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.450\nSo the cashing server is getting a copy\nof these right now and for these files,\n\n293\n00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.700\nthey're pretty small, the camera\nupdate was really small, 8 megs, so\n\n294\n00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.900\nit downloaded fast.\n\n295\n00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.780\nThe iTunes one,\nit just finished downloading.\n\n296\n00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.730\nIt was 169 megabytes.\n\n297\n00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:11.300\nThis el capitan update,\nthat's a big one, right?\n\n298\n00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.690\nSo when it goes to download,\nlet me go ahead and download that one.\n\n299\n00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:18.960\nSo it's gonna start downloading\nit's 1.4 gigs in size.\n\n300\n00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.180\nSo it's a bigger update.\n\n301\n00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.080\nIt's going to take a little while\nto download, so there it goes.\n\n302\n00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.030\nAnd it's going crazy there isn't it?\n\n303\n00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:30.560\nBut it is downloading, at 1.4 gigs and\nslowly pulling that information.\n\n304\n00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.250\nNow, I don't have to sit here and\nwatch it.\n\n305\n00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.320\nI'm going to jump over\nto the caching server.\n\n306\n00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.470\nThe caching server still shows,\ncache used none.\n\n307\n00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.000\nSo it's not working, is it?\n\n308\n00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.150\nWell remember the server app\ndoesn't automatically refresh.\n\n309\n00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.850\nSo you can go to the view menu\nup there and hit refresh, or\n\n310\n00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:49.210\nyou can do command R like I just did,\nwhen you do command R it will refresh and\n\n311\n00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.853\nnow I can see cache used 1.6 gigs.\n\n312\n00:14:51.853 --> 00:14:54.830\n1.6 gigs, how did that happen?\n\n313\n00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.840\nWell, there was the camera\nupdate at 8 mgs.\n\n314\n00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.890\nThere was the Itunes update at 179 mgs,\nand\n\n315\n00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:07.330\nnow it's downloading the utility of\nthe El Capitan update which is 1.4 gigs.\n\n316\n00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.730\nIt hasn't actually downloaded yet, but\n\n317\n00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:12.810\nit's reserved that space which\nis why it's already at 1.6 gigs.\n\n318\n00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:17.550\nSo it's showing that cash being used and\nrestoring it right here on the drive.\n\n319\n00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.980\nSo I didn't change\na single thing over here.\n\n320\n00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:25.480\nI did not even tell it about the caching\nserver, and yet it knows about it,\n\n321\n00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.770\nand it's using it.\n\n322\n00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.360\nThat's kind of a nice part,\nit's automatic, right?\n\n323\n00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.369\nLet's talk a little bit about\nthat while we're waiting here.\n\n324\n00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:36.610\nThe way it really works is a little\nmore complex than just using Bonjour.\n\n325\n00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.715\nWhat happens is when I turned\non this caching server,\n\n326\n00:15:39.715 --> 00:15:44.476\nmy server reached out to Apple, and said,\nhey Apple, I'm a caching server, and\n\n327\n00:15:44.476 --> 00:15:49.375\nApple said that's nice, you're a caching\nserver, and they made a little note,\n\n328\n00:15:49.375 --> 00:15:53.929\nright added this little list, and they\nlooked at the IP address of the server,\n\n329\n00:15:53.929 --> 00:15:57.973\nnot the internal address The external\naddress, and let me show you.\n\n330\n00:15:57.973 --> 00:16:02.547\nIf I go back into my server app and\nI go to the main server page here and\n\n331\n00:16:02.547 --> 00:16:07.122\nI go to my overview, right here in\nthe overview I can see my server is\n\n332\n00:16:07.122 --> 00:16:11.704\ncalled OS10-SERVER01, and\nthere's my computer name, and\n\n333\n00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:16.989\nthen on the internet I'm\nreachable at 209.251.159.179.\n\n334\n00:16:16.989 --> 00:16:21.793\nBut that's not my address,\nI think I'm set for DHCP, but\n\n335\n00:16:21.793 --> 00:16:27.185\nanyhow, if I go into System Preferences,\nand I go into Network,\n\n336\n00:16:27.185 --> 00:16:33.210\ninside of my networking,\nmy address is 192.168.0.151.\n\n337\n00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.160\nThat's my internal address,\nthat's my network address on the LAN,\n\n338\n00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.890\non the Local Area Network.\n\n339\n00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:41.430\nBut when I go out to the internet,\nthat’s not a real address, right?\n\n340\n00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.345\nI'm not gonna be able to go out to\nthe internet with that address, so\n\n341\n00:16:44.345 --> 00:16:47.300\nthere’s a router that's\ndoing address translation.\n\n342\n00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:53.418\nAnd I'm getting translated to this IP,\nthe server app is showing that.\n\n343\n00:16:53.418 --> 00:16:59.100\nSo when I go to Apple and I say, hey, I'm\na caching server, Apple makes a note and\n\n344\n00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:07.215\nsays, there's a caching server behind\n209.251.159.179 and it makes a note of it.\n\n345\n00:17:07.215 --> 00:17:11.237\nEvery client that fires up,\nphones home to Apple.\n\n346\n00:17:11.237 --> 00:17:15.958\nWhen you boot a Mac, when you boot an\niPhone, a iPad, an OS X device, when they\n\n347\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:20.917\nfirst connect to a network, the first\nthing they do is they reach out to Apple.\n\n348\n00:17:20.917 --> 00:17:25.627\nAnd they say, hey Apple, I'm here,\nare there any caching servers for me?\n\n349\n00:17:25.627 --> 00:17:29.147\nAnd Apple will look at the IP\naddress of that workstation and\n\n350\n00:17:29.147 --> 00:17:31.857\nlook to see if there's a registered\ncaching server at that same address.\n\n351\n00:17:31.857 --> 00:17:34.650\nAnd if there is,\nthen it will let the two use each other,\n\n352\n00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.170\nthat's how they're able to discover that.\n\n353\n00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.110\nAnd then they have to use\nBonjour to find each other.\n\n354\n00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:41.870\nSo they use Bonjour at the end of the day,\nbut just to find out that caching server\n\n355\n00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.030\neven exists,\nthat actually happens through Apple.\n\n356\n00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:48.772\nSo that's kind of the way that that\nlittle process works in the background.\n\n357\n00:17:48.772 --> 00:17:53.650\n>> Now Don, speaking of routing is what's\ncoming to mind, I can only assume that if\n\n358\n00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:56.950\nwe are using the caching server, well, you\nprobably got more than those 15 Macs like\n\n359\n00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.780\nwe do here on our network and that's gonna\nbe probably a medium to large business.\n\n360\n00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.150\nSo internally,\n\n361\n00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:06.170\nwe're probably gonna have maybe\na routed environment, multiple subnets,\n\n362\n00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:09.790\nhow is this gonna effect internally on the\nLAN when we're using the caching server?\n\n363\n00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.720\n>> You know, good point,\nso let me show you this.\n\n364\n00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.520\nSo I'm gonna go over to my client, and\n\n365\n00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.720\non my client which I've got two minutes\nbefore it reboots for this update.\n\n366\n00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.790\nSo let me show you this fast.\n\n367\n00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:23.655\nSo on my client,\nif I take a look at it right now,\n\n368\n00:18:23.655 --> 00:18:28.302\nmy client is 192.168.0.150.\n\n369\n00:18:28.302 --> 00:18:32.582\nMy server was 192.168.0.151,\nwe're on the same network.\n\n370\n00:18:32.582 --> 00:18:36.170\nSo, it makes sense that these two\nwould use the same caching server.\n\n371\n00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.720\nBut what if they were\non different networks.\n\n372\n00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.180\nI'm gonna move over to\na different network real quick.\n\n373\n00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.650\nAnd when I move over\nto that other network,\n\n374\n00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:50.330\nnow my address is going\nto change any moment now.\n\n375\n00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.490\nHopefully within my\nlittle two minute window.\n\n376\n00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:56.450\nSo I'm gonna, sometimes we try and,\nthere it goes.\n\n377\n00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:56.993\nAll right, there we go.\n\n378\n00:18:56.993 --> 00:19:02.197\nSo now, I'm 192.168.41.143,\nI'm on a different network.\n\n379\n00:19:02.197 --> 00:19:05.152\nThe server is 192.168.0.whatever,\n\n380\n00:19:05.152 --> 00:19:09.339\nI'm 192.168.41.whatever,\ntwo different networks.\n\n381\n00:19:09.339 --> 00:19:15.121\nBut, when I go to the internet, I'm going\nthrough the same router as my server.\n\n382\n00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:18.995\nWe're on two different subnets, but\nwe're going through the same router.\n\n383\n00:19:18.995 --> 00:19:21.900\nOver here, the server shows as going out\n\n384\n00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:27.000\nat 209.251.159.179 that's\nthe public address on my router.\n\n385\n00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.890\nWell even though my work station\nis on a different network,\n\n386\n00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:32.070\nit's going out that same router.\n\n387\n00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.410\nNow I don't have the server\napp here to show me that, but\n\n388\n00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:38.070\nI can use public services,\nlike if I fire up a web browser and\n\n389\n00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:42.160\ngo to Showmemy.info,\n\n390\n00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:48.600\nit'll tell me when I go out to the\ninternet, here's the address I'm using.\n\n391\n00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.330\nSo on this workstation even though\nI'm on a different network,\n\n392\n00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.740\nI'm going through 209.251.159.179.\n\n393\n00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.890\nAnd so when I reach out to Apple,\n\n394\n00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:02.050\nthat's how Apple sees me, and\nthat's the same as this server.\n\n395\n00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.390\nThis server that's caching that data and\nstoring it right here inside of that\n\n396\n00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:09.580\ncaching server,\nbecause we have the same public address.\n\n397\n00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.260\nIf I had different public addresses,\nit wouldn't work.\n\n398\n00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.450\nSo, for\nexample if I have a central office, and\n\n399\n00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:18.930\nthen a bunch of branch offices, if each\nbranch office has their own internet\n\n400\n00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.350\nconnection, they're gonna have\na different public IP, they're\n\n401\n00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:24.380\nnot going to use the caching server\nat headquarters, and that make sense.\n\n402\n00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.020\nCuz if you're going to have to\ngo out to the internet anyway,\n\n403\n00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.140\nyou might as well go to Apple and\n\n404\n00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.630\nuse their bandwidth instead of\nusing your headquarter's bandwidth.\n\n405\n00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:33.900\nYou really only wanna provide services for\npeople on the same network as you.\n\n406\n00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.494\nSo that's kinda a key component there,\n\n407\n00:20:35.494 --> 00:20:38.990\nthe caching server will only work\nif the clients are going out\n\n408\n00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:42.450\nto the internet with the same IP\naddress as the caching servers.\n\n409\n00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.280\nSo that's how we kinda make that happen.\n\n410\n00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.220\nAll right, now the cache,\nit's being stored here on the hard drive.\n\n411\n00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.390\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n412\n00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.500\nReally, Apple doesn't want us\nto mess with the cache too much.\n\n413\n00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.160\nThe cache is protected.\n\n414\n00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.240\nThe reason it's protected is,\nimagine this,\n\n415\n00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.790\nimagine we downloaded an El Capitan update\nand it was stored here in the cache.\n\n416\n00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.360\nAnd then somebody wanted to be\nmalicious and they went in and\n\n417\n00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.120\nthey modified the update,\nthey put some malware in it.\n\n418\n00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.810\nAnd now every client on your network\ngoes to download that update,\n\n419\n00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:12.100\nand they get this modified\ncopy from your server.\n\n420\n00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.770\nThey're not going to get\na modified copy from Apple,\n\n421\n00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.410\nthey would have got a good\nupdate from Apple, but from us,\n\n422\n00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.740\nthey're now getting a modified\ncopy that's got malware in it, and\n\n423\n00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.350\nit'll distribute through\nyour whole network.\n\n424\n00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.500\nSo the cache needs to protected.\n\n425\n00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.670\nSo it is, it's stuck on the hard drive,\nand it's stuck in there in a way that we\n\n426\n00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:29.500\ncan't really mess with it, and if we do\nmess with it, it invalidates the files.\n\n427\n00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.740\nApple does a digital\nsignature on every file so\n\n428\n00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.810\nif they get tampered with\nit just throws them away.\n\n429\n00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.560\nBut you can see them.\n\n430\n00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.280\nLet me jump into my terminal here and\nI'll show you where they are.\n\n431\n00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.880\nThere's not really a need for\nyou to ever go into this thing.\n\n432\n00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:48.220\nIf the cache ever fills up, it'll delete\nold files to make room for new files.\n\n433\n00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.117\nSo you never really have to go in here\nto delete anything or worry about it,\n\n434\n00:21:51.117 --> 00:21:52.586\nit's all designed to be automatic.\n\n435\n00:21:52.586 --> 00:21:57.191\nBut if I go into /Library/Server,\nso just right off the root,\n\n436\n00:21:57.191 --> 00:22:02.140\n/Library/Server and you take a look\nin there you'll see we've got\n\n437\n00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:07.290\na caching folder, and\ninside of caching there's a data folder.\n\n438\n00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:12.610\nNow that data folder, I can see it\nright here, that's where the cache is.\n\n439\n00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:16.270\nAnd if I browse into it,\nI get permission denied.\n\n440\n00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.790\nIt's protected.\n\n441\n00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:21.570\nI'm an admin, but it is not gonna let\nme in get in and mess with that folder.\n\n442\n00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.834\nAnd if you try the tried-and-trued,\nlike sudo commands,\n\n443\n00:22:24.834 --> 00:22:28.229\nsudo doesn't really work with\nthe change directory command.\n\n444\n00:22:28.229 --> 00:22:31.755\nSo if I try that,\nit's gonna try move me in there and\n\n445\n00:22:31.755 --> 00:22:34.052\nthen I move right back out again.\n\n446\n00:22:34.052 --> 00:22:35.710\nAnd so, see, I'm not in the data folder.\n\n447\n00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:38.520\nSo, they're really trying to protect that\nto make sure we can't get in there, but\n\n448\n00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.508\nyou can if you do like a sudo sh.\n\n449\n00:22:40.508 --> 00:22:45.840\nSo I'm gonna drop to a root shell,\nwhich Apple really doesn't want you to do.\n\n450\n00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.980\nBut I can drop to a root shell and\nnow I can get right into that data folder.\n\n451\n00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.700\nAnd once you're in there you\ncan start to see the cache.\n\n452\n00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.370\nNow, the cache isn't going\nto mean a whole lot to you.\n\n453\n00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:57.970\nThe main file is this guy right here,\nAssetInfo.db.\n\n454\n00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.900\nThat's the database where it keeps\ntrack of all the files that is cached.\n\n455\n00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.240\nSo when a client goes to download a file,\nit asks us,\n\n456\n00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.780\nhey do you have a copy of this file?\n\n457\n00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.300\nAnd we just look at the database,\nis it in my database?\n\n458\n00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.080\nYes or no?\nIf it's not in the database,\n\n459\n00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.260\nI don't have it,\nlet's get it from the Internet.\n\n460\n00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.099\nIf it is in my database, I have it,\nand I'll serve it up to the end user.\n\n461\n00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:20.990\nNow, see this shm folder right here,\nthat's part of the security for\n\n462\n00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.600\nthis database.\n\n463\n00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.600\nThat's where our digital signatures are,\nour hashing.\n\n464\n00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.870\nSo that's all being kind\nof stored in there and\n\n465\n00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:29.290\nthen you've got a wal file\nwhich is part of its indexing.\n\n466\n00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:32.160\nSo that's all part of that database.\n\n467\n00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.130\nAll these other folders\nrepresent cached files.\n\n468\n00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:40.840\nThese are all UIDs, it's the unique\nidentifiers for the cached files.\n\n469\n00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.774\nBecause we could cache all sorts of\nthings, apps, updates, whatever.\n\n470\n00:23:43.774 --> 00:23:46.139\nSo everyone gets an ID, and\nthey don't really mean much to us.\n\n471\n00:23:46.139 --> 00:23:49.498\nOne of these will be that\ndigital camera update.\n\n472\n00:23:49.498 --> 00:23:52.240\nAnother of these will\nbe the iTunes update.\n\n473\n00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.880\nA third one will be the Yosemite update.\n\n474\n00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:58.080\nI mean El Capitan,\nwhatever it is we're using here,\n\n475\n00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.380\nthe 10.11.4 update for El Capitan.\n\n476\n00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.440\nThe other ones,\nI don't know what the heck they are.\n\n477\n00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.620\nWell, your Macs,\nthey do a lot of things in the background.\n\n478\n00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:11.560\nThey get various security updates and\nthings from Apple that don't show up as\n\n479\n00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.610\nregular updates that are manually\npushed by Apple that you don't see.\n\n480\n00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:16.650\nAnd so that'll probably be some of these.\n\n481\n00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:19.324\nOr other things that we've reached out\nto Apple for that have been cached.\n\n482\n00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:20.440\nSo it caches stuff automatically.\n\n483\n00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.310\nYou'll see things pop up\nin here all the time.\n\n484\n00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.140\n>> All right, Don,\nI got another scenario for you.\n\n485\n00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.740\nSo far we've saved some bandwidth\nhaving our caching server, but\n\n486\n00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.410\nnow management comes in and\nsays you know what?\n\n487\n00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:32.580\nWe don't have 2,000 Macs anymore,\nnow we got 10,000 Macs.\n\n488\n00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.490\nWhile our bandwidth on the WAN\nside is doing really good, man,\n\n489\n00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:40.248\nour poor caching server,\nit's just not doing so good anymore.\n\n490\n00:24:40.248 --> 00:24:45.220\nSo we decide we're gonna scale out and add\none or more caching servers to help our\n\n491\n00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.100\npoor original caching server that\njust isn't cutting the mustard.\n\n492\n00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.740\nWhat can we expect to see there?\n\n493\n00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.737\n>> All right,\nyou can do more than one caching server.\n\n494\n00:24:52.737 --> 00:24:55.840\nYou'll generally find it\ndoesn't work as well, right.\n\n495\n00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.050\nThat you'll have files that get cached\non one and not on the other, and so\n\n496\n00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:03.040\ngenerally you don't want to do multiple\ncaching servers if you can avoid it.\n\n497\n00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:08.690\nReally one caching server per public IP\nnetwork is really the way to go about it.\n\n498\n00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.920\nYou might have more than one subnet but\njust one server per is the best.\n\n499\n00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.500\nThat way,\nyou've got a consistent database of\n\n500\n00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.330\nall the cached files right there in one.\n\n501\n00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:19.680\nThe better solution is to add\nmore network adapters to it.\n\n502\n00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.406\nYou can add more network adapters\nto it to increase the bandwidth.\n\n503\n00:25:22.406 --> 00:25:24.650\nYou can even bond network\nadapters together.\n\n504\n00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:28.170\nSo if you have a gig adapter, you could\nput two gigabit adapters in there and\n\n505\n00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:29.880\nbond them together to\nincrease that bandwidth.\n\n506\n00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.820\nSo there's technologies like that to make\nit where one server could do more for\n\n507\n00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:33.530\nyou, but\n\n508\n00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:37.140\nyou're always better off having one server\nas opposed to more if you can avoid it.\n\n509\n00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:40.179\n>> Now you did say that in\nmultiple geographical locations,\n\n510\n00:25:40.179 --> 00:25:43.164\na caching server really isn't intended for\nthat point.\n\n511\n00:25:43.164 --> 00:25:46.485\nWould the same advice apply\nto multiple geographical\n\n512\n00:25:46.485 --> 00:25:49.460\nlocations about multiple caching servers?\n\n513\n00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:50.430\n>> Well, a little different.\n\n514\n00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.940\nYou still want one caching server,\none at each location.\n\n515\n00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.820\nSo let's use a school as an example,\nright?\n\n516\n00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.090\nSo here in the United States our\nschools are divided up into counties.\n\n517\n00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:02.970\nAnd so you usually have a central county\noffice and then you'll have any number of\n\n518\n00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:07.223\nelementary schools or high schools or\nwhatever located throughout.\n\n519\n00:26:07.223 --> 00:26:10.880\nSo let's say that I'm at a location\nwhere you've got the central office and\n\n520\n00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.250\nthen you've got 100 schools.\n\n521\n00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:16.670\nWhat I would need is 101 caching servers.\n\n522\n00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:20.540\nI'd need one caching server at the central\noffice and then one caching server at\n\n523\n00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:24.510\nevery single school, assuming the schools\nhad enough machines to make it worthwhile.\n\n524\n00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.020\nSome schools might be really small.\n\n525\n00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.430\nThey might only have 50 computers, and\nso I don't worry about a caching server.\n\n526\n00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:31.760\nOther schools might be bigger and\nhave 2,000 computers, and so\n\n527\n00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.130\nI do put a caching server.\n\n528\n00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:35.720\nIt's up to us how you wanna do that.\n\n529\n00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.343\nAnd remember your caching server\ncan be used for other stuff too, so\n\n530\n00:26:38.343 --> 00:26:40.426\nit could be a file server,\nan open directory server.\n\n531\n00:26:40.426 --> 00:26:44.017\nYou'll probably want an open directory\nserver at those schools anyway for\n\n532\n00:26:44.017 --> 00:26:46.880\nauthentication, so\nyou turn it into a caching server too.\n\n533\n00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.590\nIt can do more than one role with\nthe exception of software update, right?\n\n534\n00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:52.750\nYou can't do caching and software update.\n\n535\n00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:55.360\nAnd even if there are two separate boxes,\nyou're not supposed to do both.\n\n536\n00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.410\nYou gotta pick one or the other.\n\n537\n00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:59.290\nIf I have a caching server,\nno software update server.\n\n538\n00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:01.565\nIf I have a software update server,\nno caching server.\n\n539\n00:27:01.565 --> 00:27:04.490\nRight, you gotta pick one or\nthe other at those locations.\n\n540\n00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:09.430\nSo if we deploy this,\nit's not based on subnets.\n\n541\n00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:13.675\nIt's based on the WAN connectivity,\nso geographic locations.\n\n542\n00:27:13.675 --> 00:27:15.644\nOne caching server per\ngeographic location,\n\n543\n00:27:15.644 --> 00:27:17.520\nif there's enough machines to warrant it.\n\n544\n00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.930\nAll right, I guess if we wanted to go\na little bit further, I could browse into\n\n545\n00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:25.450\none of these folders and just kinda\nshow you how these updates get stored.\n\n546\n00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:30.420\nIt's kind of a mess when you really\ndig all the way down into here.\n\n547\n00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.760\nThat's a 0 byte file,\nthat's not a good example.\n\n548\n00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.340\nSo I don't know the actual\nidentifiers here, so\n\n549\n00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.720\nI kind of have to just poke around.\n\n550\n00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.730\nSo it must be in the process\nof downloading a few of these.\n\n551\n00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.720\nBut they're not necessarily named\nanything that we would recognize.\n\n552\n00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:52.250\nHm, I was kind of hoping to\nfind at least one [LAUGH]\n\n553\n00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:56.320\nthat could show us the file, but\nI'm not having much luck here.\n\n554\n00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.831\nSo once it downloads them, though,\n\n555\n00:27:57.831 --> 00:28:00.188\nthey are just files that sit\nright here on the hard drive.\n\n556\n00:28:00.188 --> 00:28:03.403\nAnd they are hashed and signed so\nthat they can't be tampered with.\n\n557\n00:28:03.403 --> 00:28:07.083\nAnd you can spot them in here, yeah,\nthese are all showing as 0 byte.\n\n558\n00:28:07.083 --> 00:28:11.731\nBut they do get stored in here somewhere\nin each of these, so they'll turn up.\n\n559\n00:28:11.731 --> 00:28:14.140\nOne just appeared too, so yeah,\nthey're gonna keep popping up.\n\n560\n00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.180\nBut that stuff gets stored right there.\n\n561\n00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.950\nIt gets saved until we reset the cache.\n\n562\n00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:23.690\nSo if I go back to my server and I reset\nthe cache, it's gonna wipe that out and\n\n563\n00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:24.960\nit's gonna empty the cache out.\n\n564\n00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.280\nBut I'm still a caching server, so\n\n565\n00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.630\nas people go to download updates, they'll\njust repopulate and start to grow again.\n\n566\n00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.400\nIn the background that database will\nget updated to reflect that we don't\n\n567\n00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.440\nhave the cache.\n\n568\n00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.723\nThese folders don't\nalways disappear though.\n\n569\n00:28:36.723 --> 00:28:40.103\nIn my case they did, but they don't always\ndisappear because sometimes it's gonna\n\n570\n00:28:40.103 --> 00:28:43.450\nimmediately start re-downloading them\nagain and so they pop right back up again.\n\n571\n00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:44.680\nI kind of assumed that would happen for\n\n572\n00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.120\nme, but\nin my case I can see they're all gone.\n\n573\n00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.530\nI've now emptied out my cache, and it'll\njust start to regrow as people update.\n\n574\n00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:53.109\n>> Well, Don, thank you for showing us\nthe ins and out of the caching server.\n\n575\n00:28:53.109 --> 00:28:56.110\nAnd I can tell you right now,\nI think I'm gonna volunteer my services\n\n576\n00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.403\nto help your clients connect\nto the caching server.\n\n577\n00:28:58.403 --> 00:29:01.060\nI think that's a job that I\ncan definitely handle there.\n\n578\n00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.250\nBut I do see that we're approaching\nthe end of the episode here.\n\n579\n00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:07.540\nBut before we do that,\ndo you have any parting advice?\n\n580\n00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.630\n>> The main thing,\nI know I've said it like 20 times now,\n\n581\n00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:12.610\nis you do need to make that decision\nbetween caching and software update.\n\n582\n00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:15.660\nWatch the software update server show,\nbecause you'll see in there that it's\n\n583\n00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.730\na very useful product and\nit does a lot of things.\n\n584\n00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.320\nSo it's a powerful one,\nit's one you'll probably want.\n\n585\n00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.970\nI usually pick software\nupdate over caching, right?\n\n586\n00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:26.175\nBut if you've got a guest wireless\nnetwork, that's a great place to have\n\n587\n00:29:26.175 --> 00:29:28.604\na caching server because you\nhave all of these guests and\n\n588\n00:29:28.604 --> 00:29:32.150\nyou want to minimize their bandwidth\nconsumption so you can use it there.\n\n589\n00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:34.360\nBut just don't mix and match the two.\n\n590\n00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.040\nThat's the main lesson to take away here.\n\n591\n00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.290\n>> Well, we thank you for\nall that knowledge on this subject.\n\n592\n00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:39.920\nAnd we thank you,\nthe viewer, for watching us.\n\n593\n00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.400\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\ntake the time to sign out here at ITProTV.\n\n594\n00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.390\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n595\n00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:45.090\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n596\n00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:48.691\n>> And we'll see you

00:00:17.953\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\nin today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:17.953 --> 00:00:20.847\nwe are moving through our\nOS X Server Essentials.\n\n5\n00:00:20.847 --> 00:00:24.204\nAnd today, we are looking at\nimplementing deployment solutions.\n\n6\n00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:27.719\nAnd more specifically, we are looking at\nthe world of software update servers.\n\n7\n00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.752\nTo help us out with that topic,\nnone other than Mr Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:30.752 --> 00:00:31.462\nDon, how are we doing today, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:31.462 --> 00:00:32.154\n>> I am doing great, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:32.154 --> 00:00:35.761\nI'm ready to explain some of\nthe comments I made in the last episode.\n\n11\n00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:36.985\nIf you didn't watch it,\n\n12\n00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:40.265\nwe filmed an episode earlier on\nthe caching service inside of OS X.\n\n13\n00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:45.401\nAnd I said many, many times that we've got\nto pick between the caching service and\n\n14\n00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:47.343\nthe software update service.\n\n15\n00:00:47.343 --> 00:00:50.042\nAnd we're not supposed to run both of\nthem, you've got to run one or the other.\n\n16\n00:00:50.042 --> 00:00:52.653\nThe problem was we hadn't learned about\nthe software update service yet and\n\n17\n00:00:52.653 --> 00:00:53.812\nin this episode we're going to.\n\n18\n00:00:53.812 --> 00:00:57.310\nWe're gonna see what the software update\nservice is, how to get it turned on,\n\n19\n00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.925\nhow to get it configured and kinda see why\nit conflicts with the caching service.\n\n20\n00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:02.763\nAnd how we can make our decision over,\n\n21\n00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:05.182\nwhich is the one that we\nwant to use on our network.\n\n22\n00:01:05.182 --> 00:01:08.662\nYou'll find that at least for me,\nit's normally the software update server.\n\n23\n00:01:08.662 --> 00:01:11.827\nI normally pick it over the caching\nserver, but you certainly,\n\n24\n00:01:11.827 --> 00:01:13.301\nyou can choose the other one.\n\n25\n00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:14.091\nThere's nothing stopping you.\n\n26\n00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:15.256\nThey're both part of the server.\n\n27\n00:01:15.256 --> 00:01:17.118\nActually, it's not likely to pay extra for\none or the other.\n\n28\n00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:19.208\nYou just need to be informed and\nmake the decision that's right for\n\n29\n00:01:19.208 --> 00:01:19.852\nyour environment.\n\n30\n00:01:19.852 --> 00:01:21.589\n>> Don, I've got the server app open.\n\n31\n00:01:21.589 --> 00:01:22.910\nIt's in front of me right now.\n\n32\n00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.129\nI wanna get it started, but\n\n33\n00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:27.052\nI do know that there are some\nconsiderations before we even turn.\n\n34\n00:01:27.052 --> 00:01:28.256\nI can only imagine by now the on switch.\n\n35\n00:01:28.256 --> 00:01:31.927\nSo, what are some things that\nwe have to consider beforehand?\n\n36\n00:01:31.927 --> 00:01:33.953\n>> So we got a little spoiled\nwith the caching server,\n\n37\n00:01:33.953 --> 00:01:36.511\ncuz the caching server you just\nflip an on switch and that's it.\n\n38\n00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:40.200\nBut the software update server though,\nwe've got some bigger problems.\n\n39\n00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.131\nWe got a little more that\nwe need to do on it and\n\n40\n00:01:42.131 --> 00:01:44.812\nthe main reason is we need to\nthink about what it's gonna do.\n\n41\n00:01:44.812 --> 00:01:47.161\nThe software update server\nis different than caching.\n\n42\n00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:50.606\nWith caching, you wait for\na client to go and download something.\n\n43\n00:01:50.606 --> 00:01:54.281\nAnd when it downloads an update,\nthe caching server stores a copy of it.\n\n44\n00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:57.129\nSo, it builds this cache overtime.\n\n45\n00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:59.203\nThe software update server\ndoesn't do it like that.\n\n46\n00:01:59.203 --> 00:02:02.063\nThe software update server\nreaches up to Apple and\n\n47\n00:02:02.063 --> 00:02:06.011\ndownloads the updates right now\nwhether somebody asks for it or not,\n\n48\n00:02:06.011 --> 00:02:08.954\nit's gonna go and\nget that update and hold on to it.\n\n49\n00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:12.876\nNow once its got the update,\nnow people can come and request it and\n\n50\n00:02:12.876 --> 00:02:13.885\nget a copy of it.\n\n51\n00:02:13.885 --> 00:02:17.821\nAnd you will have the ability to turn\nthat on or off to enable or disable it,\n\n52\n00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:20.179\nbut the point is you\nalready downloaded it.\n\n53\n00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:23.090\nSo, that's different\nthan the caching server.\n\n54\n00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.628\nSo, the number one consideration I have\nwhen I do a software update server is\n\n55\n00:02:26.628 --> 00:02:27.246\ndisk space.\n\n56\n00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:29.294\nMy server doesn't have a whole\nheck of a lot of space.\n\n57\n00:02:29.294 --> 00:02:31.544\nSo if I start going and\ndownloading a ton of stuff,\n\n58\n00:02:31.544 --> 00:02:33.751\nI'm probably gonna run\nout of hard drive space.\n\n59\n00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:37.208\nWe normally wanna have an extra\nhard drive for storing the updates.\n\n60\n00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:40.737\nWe don't necessarily need to back it up,\ncuz worst case scenario, you just go and\n\n61\n00:02:40.737 --> 00:02:43.768\ndownload them again, but\nunderstand that updates can really add up.\n\n62\n00:02:43.768 --> 00:02:48.210\nYou can end up with a ton of\nstorage if you're not careful,\n\n63\n00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.119\nbecause it's just a good chunk\nof data that every minor update.\n\n64\n00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:57.310\nSo when El Capitan first came out,\nyou download 10.11.\n\n65\n00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.263\nIt's about 3.6 gigs in size and\nthen when 10.11.1 came out and\n\n66\n00:03:02.263 --> 00:03:07.638\n10.11.2, 10.11.3,\nall of those are about a gig in size each.\n\n67\n00:03:07.638 --> 00:03:09.906\nSo, they start to add up and\nyou need each one.\n\n68\n00:03:09.906 --> 00:03:14.459\nThen if there's betas that are coming out,\nthose can get downloaded and stored.\n\n69\n00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.415\nIt can really add up.\n\n70\n00:03:15.415 --> 00:03:18.372\nSo, definitely make sure you got enough\nstorage to be able to handle that.\n\n71\n00:03:18.372 --> 00:03:20.861\nWe wanna make sure that\nwe've got it cached.\n\n72\n00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:22.967\nNow unlike the caching server,\n\n73\n00:03:22.967 --> 00:03:27.112\nthe software update server just\nfocuses on software updates.\n\n74\n00:03:27.112 --> 00:03:32.170\nIt does not do books from iBooks.\n\n75\n00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.996\nIt doesn't do things from the iTunes\nuniversity store or iTunes U.\n\n76\n00:03:34.996 --> 00:03:37.472\nIt doesn't do apps from the App Store.\n\n77\n00:03:37.472 --> 00:03:42.460\nIt just does software updates for\nApple products.\n\n78\n00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.340\nSo if I go and\n\n79\n00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.050\ndownload a third party app from the App\nStore, not on the software updates.\n\n80\n00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.444\nIf an update comes out for that third\nparty app, not on the software updates.\n\n81\n00:03:50.755 --> 00:03:53.783\nBut if an update comes out for iTunes,\n\n82\n00:03:53.783 --> 00:03:57.862\nthat will make it into\nthe software update server.\n\n83\n00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:00.674\nAnd even better,\nwe'll be able to turn it on and off.\n\n84\n00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:04.128\nSo that's going to be one of the big\nthings we need to think about before we\n\n85\n00:04:04.128 --> 00:04:07.923\nget this one turned on is that it's not as\nrobust in terms of what it can cache like\n\n86\n00:04:07.923 --> 00:04:10.553\na caching server, but\nit does give us a lot more power.\n\n87\n00:04:10.553 --> 00:04:12.851\nSo on my system, let's see.\n\n88\n00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:14.787\nWe actually might run into\na problem with my system,\n\n89\n00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:16.644\ncuz I don't have a ton of\nhard drive space on here.\n\n90\n00:04:16.644 --> 00:04:18.678\nSo, I'll show us kind of\nhow to get around that.\n\n91\n00:04:18.678 --> 00:04:20.211\nBut if you look at mine,\n\n92\n00:04:20.211 --> 00:04:24.368\nI've got a hard drive that is I\nwould say about 43 gigs in size.\n\n93\n00:04:24.368 --> 00:04:26.038\nThat's not a terribly large drive.\n\n94\n00:04:26.038 --> 00:04:28.626\nSo, am I gonna be able to\nstore a lot of updates?\n\n95\n00:04:28.626 --> 00:04:29.359\nProbably not.\n\n96\n00:04:29.359 --> 00:04:31.502\nI'm probably gonna need\nto add an extra drive.\n\n97\n00:04:31.502 --> 00:04:33.863\nAnd so like many services,\nwhen I go to turn this on,\n\n98\n00:04:33.863 --> 00:04:37.045\nI can choose to move where that storage\nis and move it to another drive.\n\n99\n00:04:37.045 --> 00:04:40.135\nNow before I turn it on,\nif you look here in my server,\n\n100\n00:04:40.135 --> 00:04:44.073\nI've got the caching server still\nturned on from our last episode.\n\n101\n00:04:44.073 --> 00:04:48.456\nSo if I had the caching server turned on,\ncan I turn on software updates?\n\n102\n00:04:48.456 --> 00:04:49.188\nActually, I can.\n\n103\n00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:52.958\nYeah, it will let you turn it on,\nbut it's not gonna work.\n\n104\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.612\n[LAUGH] So you can do that,\nit just won't work.\n\n105\n00:04:55.612 --> 00:04:59.050\nSo I need to turn one off,\nturn the other one on.\n\n106\n00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.848\nIt'll actually let you\nrun both simultaneously.\n\n107\n00:05:00.848 --> 00:05:02.599\nIt's just systems aren't gonna use it.\n\n108\n00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.697\nIf I take a client and\nI register it to use my update server,\n\n109\n00:05:05.697 --> 00:05:07.413\nit'll stop using the caching.\n\n110\n00:05:07.413 --> 00:05:10.447\nOr if I turn both of these on and\nI don't do anything to my client,\n\n111\n00:05:10.447 --> 00:05:13.896\nthe client will just use the cache and\nit won't use the software update.\n\n112\n00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:16.401\nSo, the client is only gonna use one or\nthe other.\n\n113\n00:05:16.401 --> 00:05:19.501\n>> Don, when it comes to the storage\nlocation and some of these services that\n\n114\n00:05:19.501 --> 00:05:22.305\nyou've shown us in past episodes,\nwe've had to make the choice.\n\n115\n00:05:22.305 --> 00:05:25.779\nYou make the choice now and you can\nforever hold your peace, never come back.\n\n116\n00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:29.130\nWith the storage of your software updates,\nis this another one of those where pick it\n\n117\n00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.364\nnow, because it might be\ndifficult to change it later?\n\n118\n00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:32.563\n>> Yeah, you definitely wanna pick it now.\n\n119\n00:05:32.563 --> 00:05:34.103\nYou can change it later.\n\n120\n00:05:34.103 --> 00:05:39.364\nBut if you've downloaded 500 gigs\nof updates, which is very possible.\n\n121\n00:05:39.364 --> 00:05:41.644\nThen when you go to move\nthe storage location,\n\n122\n00:05:41.644 --> 00:05:43.577\nit's gotta copy 400 gigs of files.\n\n123\n00:05:43.577 --> 00:05:44.340\nAnd so, it's gonna take awhile.\n\n124\n00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.931\nNow if you're patient and\nyou don't have a problem with that,\n\n125\n00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:51.517\nthen it's not a big deal to move it,\nbut it is kind of a hassle and\n\n126\n00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:55.346\nit's better to have the position\nset correctly in the beginning.\n\n127\n00:05:55.346 --> 00:05:58.408\nAnd that way, they all download in\nthe right place unlike the caching server.\n\n128\n00:05:58.408 --> 00:06:00.796\nRemember, on the caching server,\nwe can just empty it and\n\n129\n00:06:00.796 --> 00:06:02.273\nit would rebuild itself over time.\n\n130\n00:06:02.273 --> 00:06:04.835\nWith the update server,\nyou can't really empty it.\n\n131\n00:06:04.835 --> 00:06:06.330\nYou can if you go and empty it out, but\n\n132\n00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.705\nthen you'd have to manually\ndownload everything again.\n\n133\n00:06:08.705 --> 00:06:12.551\nIt's not really designed for you to do\nthat, so you will want to move it and\n\n134\n00:06:12.551 --> 00:06:13.618\nit just takes time.\n\n135\n00:06:13.618 --> 00:06:15.509\nJust be aware of that, but\nit is the update server.\n\n136\n00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:17.785\nIf your update server goes offline,\nwhat's gonna happen?\n\n137\n00:06:17.785 --> 00:06:19.253\nPeople stop receiving updates.\n\n138\n00:06:19.253 --> 00:06:20.737\nIf they stop receiving updates,\n\n139\n00:06:20.737 --> 00:06:24.500\nyou might have security vulnerabilities\non your network that are going unpatched.\n\n140\n00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.923\nSo, you wanna minimize that.\n\n141\n00:06:25.923 --> 00:06:29.688\nBut if it takes three hours to copy\nthose files to a new location,\n\n142\n00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:32.520\ncan I go three hours without updates?\n\n143\n00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.953\nYeah, I can, because your Mac's\nonly check for updates once a day.\n\n144\n00:06:35.953 --> 00:06:38.396\nWait, when they're connected to a local\nupdate server, it's only once a day.\n\n145\n00:06:38.396 --> 00:06:40.593\nWhen they're connected to Apple,\nit's once every four days.\n\n146\n00:06:40.593 --> 00:06:41.610\nSo, it's not even that frequent.\n\n147\n00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.162\nSo you can go a few hours,\nit'll be all right.\n\n148\n00:06:44.162 --> 00:06:46.105\nSo most of us don't worry\ntoo much about it, but\n\n149\n00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:48.497\nit certainly does make life\neasier to set it ahead of time.\n\n150\n00:06:48.497 --> 00:06:49.517\nSo, let's see that real quick.\n\n151\n00:06:49.517 --> 00:06:52.277\nSo, first thing I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna turn my caching server off.\n\n152\n00:06:52.277 --> 00:06:54.827\nI don't need it, I'm gonna use\nthe software updates instead.\n\n153\n00:06:54.827 --> 00:06:56.413\nSo, I'll turn caching off and\n\n154\n00:06:56.413 --> 00:06:59.104\nthen software updates is\ndown here under Advanced.\n\n155\n00:06:59.104 --> 00:07:01.714\nSo I need to go under Advanced and\ndown here,\n\n156\n00:07:01.714 --> 00:07:04.194\nwe'll find Software Update right here.\n\n157\n00:07:04.194 --> 00:07:08.480\nAnd when you look at software update,\nthere's not a ton of settings.\n\n158\n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.458\nIf I look at it,\nI've got the updates themselves,\n\n159\n00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:12.944\nwhich I haven't downloaded any and\nthen I've got my Settings.\n\n160\n00:07:12.944 --> 00:07:16.678\nThere's only two settings and\nit's really one setting I can pick,\n\n161\n00:07:16.678 --> 00:07:17.933\nit's a radio button.\n\n162\n00:07:17.933 --> 00:07:19.516\nThe default mode is Automatic.\n\n163\n00:07:19.516 --> 00:07:23.485\nAutomatic means whenever an update comes\nout from Apple, we are gonna download it.\n\n164\n00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:27.550\nAnd once we have got it,\nwe'll approve it for all of our clients.\n\n165\n00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.690\nIt's really not very different\nfrom the caching server.\n\n166\n00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.316\nWith the caching server, the first\ntime somebody goes to downloads it and\n\n167\n00:07:34.316 --> 00:07:36.020\nnow it's available to everyone.\n\n168\n00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.269\nThis doesn't even wait for\nsomebody to download it.\n\n169\n00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:42.048\nNobody could ask for the update,\nwe'll download it, anyway.\n\n170\n00:07:42.048 --> 00:07:43.377\nAnd now, we make it available to them.\n\n171\n00:07:43.377 --> 00:07:44.748\nSo, it's a little bit preemptive.\n\n172\n00:07:44.748 --> 00:07:48.859\nSo if I have a hundred people downloading\nthe update, the first person will get\n\n173\n00:07:48.859 --> 00:07:52.361\nit a little bit faster this way than\nthey would on a caching server.\n\n174\n00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:55.922\nCuz on a caching server, the first person\nwould have to actively download it, but\n\n175\n00:07:55.922 --> 00:07:58.154\nthat doesn't really give\nme the power that I want.\n\n176\n00:07:58.154 --> 00:08:00.256\nThe power that I want\nis when we go Manual.\n\n177\n00:08:00.256 --> 00:08:04.354\nManual let's me pick when\nI download the updates.\n\n178\n00:08:04.354 --> 00:08:08.040\nAnd it let's me pick when\nI want to enable them.\n\n179\n00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.630\nI can download an update and\n\n180\n00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:14.490\napply it to my testing machines, but\nnot apply it to the rest of my company.\n\n181\n00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.510\nAnd only when I've tested the update and\n\n182\n00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.440\nI know it's valid will I then approve\nit and now everybody can get it.\n\n183\n00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.693\nI have that control of\nwhen that update goes out.\n\n184\n00:08:21.693 --> 00:08:24.989\n>> Don, it's getting a little brighter in\nthe studio here cuz I'm having some light\n\n185\n00:08:24.989 --> 00:08:25.864\nbulb moments go off.\n\n186\n00:08:25.864 --> 00:08:26.523\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n187\n00:08:26.523 --> 00:08:29.587\nI could tell you in a past episode with\nthe caching server, you said that that was\n\n188\n00:08:29.587 --> 00:08:32.379\none of the big differences between\na caching server and a Software Update\n\n189\n00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:35.570\nserver is the fact that you have\nthe control on the Software Update server.\n\n190\n00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.520\nIs that we're seeing here?\n\n191\n00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.290\nThis is the control that\nyou're talking about?\n\n192\n00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:39.560\n>> Yeah.\nAnd we'll see it more.\n\n193\n00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.290\nWhen we get to the big list of\nall the updates that its got, and\n\n194\n00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:46.490\nwe see them, you'll see that we have\na few options that you can download, or\n\n195\n00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.800\nyou can download and enable, right?\n\n196\n00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.540\nIf I download it, I get it and I hold it,\nbut I don't give it out to people yet.\n\n197\n00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.720\nIf I download and enable,\nnow it's ready for everyone to have.\n\n198\n00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.980\nIf I've downloaded it and I've tested it,\nnow I can go and enable it.\n\n199\n00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.450\nOr if I've already enabled it and\nit's rolled out to everybody and\n\n200\n00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.100\nit's causing problems, I can disable it.\n\n201\n00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.917\nSay, stop, stop giving that to people.\n\n202\n00:09:03.917 --> 00:09:05.892\n[LAUGH] And now we can go in and\ncorrect it.\n\n203\n00:09:05.892 --> 00:09:07.418\nSo you have that.\nThat's that functionality\n\n204\n00:09:07.418 --> 00:09:08.517\nwe get with Software Update.\n\n205\n00:09:08.517 --> 00:09:10.200\n>> You also mentioned patch management.\n\n206\n00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.090\nNow, when it comes to patch management,\nand\n\n207\n00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.440\nyou said this only works\non Apple-based software,\n\n208\n00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.510\nwhat if I have existing software\nalready deployed in my enterprise?\n\n209\n00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.240\nIs there anything that I have\nto be concerned with here?\n\n210\n00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.735\n>> Concerned with the fact\nthat this doesn't handle it.\n\n211\n00:09:25.735 --> 00:09:30.060\n[LAUGH] So maybe you have\nAdobe Photoshop installed, right?\n\n212\n00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.590\nAnd Apple pushes updates for\nAdobe Photoshop all the time,\n\n213\n00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.530\nor God forbid you have Java installed,\n\n214\n00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.840\nApple pushes,Adobe pushes,\nI got to get the right companies here.\n\n215\n00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.440\nIt's Oracle.\n\n216\n00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.140\nOracle pushes updates for\nJava everyday single day it seems, right?\n\n217\n00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.660\nSoftware Update here,\nit doesn't do Oracle's Java.\n\n218\n00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:52.760\nSo if I wanna manage that, instead what\nI can use is Apple Remote Desktop.\n\n219\n00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.810\nApple Remote Desktop can push PKG files.\n\n220\n00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.820\nIt can push packages from anybody and\npush them out to people.\n\n221\n00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.490\nAnd now you get the control cuz you're\ndoing it through that separate system.\n\n222\n00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:04.010\nSo Apple Remote Desktop is better for\nmanaging third party software.\n\n223\n00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.900\nThis Software Update service is\ndesigned for Apple software.\n\n224\n00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.220\n>> All right.\nSo now what we're gonna do in our patch\n\n225\n00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.110\nmanagement solutions,\n\n226\n00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.060\nwe're gonna jump back to the side,\nApple's side of the tracks here.\n\n227\n00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.600\nNow I've got deployed in my network,\nI've got Apple-based software.\n\n228\n00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.540\nIs there anything I have to maybe consider\nconsider when it comes to updates\n\n229\n00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.060\nwhen you already have Apple-based\nsoftware deployed within your network?\n\n230\n00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.490\n>> Not really, people could already\nbe updating directly from Apple.\n\n231\n00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.880\nAs soon as I register them\nhere with this update server,\n\n232\n00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.480\nthey'll start getting them from me.\n\n233\n00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.430\nNow if they've already received\nan update that I haven't approved yet,\n\n234\n00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:35.910\nit's not going to uninstall the update.\n\n235\n00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.640\nThey're now ahead.\n\n236\n00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.940\nWe can't undo an update with a Software\nUpdate server or even if I disable\n\n237\n00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.310\nan update, if I disable an update it\ndoesn't take it away from people.\n\n238\n00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:46.840\nThey've already got it, right?\n\n239\n00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.460\nIt just stops me from handing\nit out from anybody else.\n\n240\n00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.220\nSo when we first set up\nthe Software Update server,\n\n241\n00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.520\nit's very likely that you'll have\nsome people who are already ahead.\n\n242\n00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.030\nBecause when you go to Apple,\nApple just gives you everything.\n\n243\n00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.510\nWhen you go directly to them it\ngives you the latest and greatest.\n\n244\n00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.490\nSo you'll likely have\npeople that are ahead.\n\n245\n00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.690\nAnd it may take a month or two before\nyou get to where everybody is now\n\n246\n00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.530\nset to the level of your software updates,\nor it can take a little while.\n\n247\n00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:11.970\nAll right.\nWell, on this one\n\n248\n00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.170\nwe were setting out to adjust our storage,\nright?\n\n249\n00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.560\nTo get our storage placed so we could\nthen turn on the update server and\n\n250\n00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.340\nget things in place.\n\n251\n00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.360\nSo let's pick up where that was and\njump right back in there.\n\n252\n00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.300\nNow you might have noticed that right here\non the screen that there is no option for\n\n253\n00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.670\nme to adjust storage, right?\n\n254\n00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:30.200\nOn some of these services, like when I\ndo caching, it's got Cache Location and\n\n255\n00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.560\nI can change the location and\nmove it to a different drive.\n\n256\n00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.300\nBut when I go to Software Update,\nI don't have that,\n\n257\n00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.190\nwhich is kind of a bit of\nan oversight by Apple.\n\n258\n00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:38.230\nI don't know why they did that.\n\n259\n00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.120\nBut it doesn't mean that\nwe can't move the storage.\n\n260\n00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.530\nIt just means that it's gonna\ngo at the default location.\n\n261\n00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:46.450\nAnd remember, we can change the default\nlocation by going up to our server and\n\n262\n00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.080\ngoing to the Settings tab.\n\n263\n00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.660\nAnd in the Settings tab you can define\nyour Service Data location and that's\n\n264\n00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.670\ngonna be the Service Data for everything,\nyour mail server, your web server,\n\n265\n00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:59.820\neach of the other things that don't have\ntheir own individual ability to change it.\n\n266\n00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.110\nSo I wanna change it to another location.\n\n267\n00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.480\nMy only problem is I just\nhave the one hard drive.\n\n268\n00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.936\nWell, I actually do have\nanother hard drive.\n\n269\n00:12:05.936 --> 00:12:07.360\nIt's just not prepared.\n\n270\n00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.220\nSo let me jump into my disk utility and\nI'll get that one set up.\n\n271\n00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.574\nSo I've got this other drive,\nit's a 500-gig drive so\n\n272\n00:12:13.574 --> 00:12:17.740\nit's got a nice chunk of storage on it,\nand so I'm gonna format it.\n\n273\n00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.277\nIt does need to be OS X Extended\n(Journaled), so that's the default so\n\n274\n00:12:21.277 --> 00:12:25.310\nI don't have to worry about that too much,\nand I'll just call this Storage.\n\n275\n00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.265\nThat's probably a good enough name for it.\n\n276\n00:12:27.265 --> 00:12:29.225\nSo I'll erase that so\nI've got a nice new drive,\n\n277\n00:12:29.225 --> 00:12:30.751\nwhich I am not gonna use for Time Machine.\n\n278\n00:12:30.751 --> 00:12:32.540\nAll right.\n\n279\n00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.195\nSo now, back here in my server app\nwhere it's got my service data,\n\n280\n00:12:36.195 --> 00:12:39.545\nI can change that location, and\nI can pick the other drive.\n\n281\n00:12:39.545 --> 00:12:42.815\nWell, unfortunately, the server\napp doesn't show new drives, and\n\n282\n00:12:42.815 --> 00:12:44.025\nthere's no way to refresh it.\n\n283\n00:12:44.025 --> 00:12:48.270\nYou have to quit the server app and go\nback into it, so I'll do that real quick.\n\n284\n00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.951\nAnd then it'll see that drive and\nI'll be able to add it so it's, I guess,\n\n285\n00:12:51.951 --> 00:12:53.600\na shortcoming of the server app.\n\n286\n00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.035\nThey don't expect you to add storage.\n\n287\n00:12:55.035 --> 00:12:56.120\n[LAUGH] I don't know why.\n\n288\n00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.890\nAll right, so\nwe'll give that just a second.\n\n289\n00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:59.580\nSee how it says loading?\n\n290\n00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.800\nThis is where it indexes those drives and\nit's already done it a second ago.\n\n291\n00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.090\n>> In a previous episode, Don, you showed\nus a little bit about Time Machine.\n\n292\n00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:09.320\nAnd you showed optimizing your backups and\nchanging that service data\n\n293\n00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.440\nto another drive rather than\nthe operating system drive.\n\n294\n00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.890\nIs this something that we'd have\nto take into consideration?\n\n295\n00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:16.420\nAs you've mentioned,\nthere could be 500 gigs of data.\n\n296\n00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.860\n>> Yeah, and this is something we normally\ndo very early on for a number of services,\n\n297\n00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.820\nnot just Software Update.\n\n298\n00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.540\nIf I had already downloaded my\nupdates this would take a while, but\n\n299\n00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.280\nI'm just gonna hit OK.\n\n300\n00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.400\nMine's empty, so it is copying files,\nbut it'll happen pretty quick.\n\n301\n00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.940\nBut if you've got other stuff configured,\n\n302\n00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.100\nif you're already doing software updates,\nthis could take two or three hours.\n\n303\n00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.200\nDepending on the amount\nof updates you had and\n\n304\n00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.620\nhow fast your storage was,\nit could take a while.\n\n305\n00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.420\nSee how mine's moving the data\nlocation for the profile manager now?\n\n306\n00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.890\nBut I am running the Profile Manager,\nit's gotta move that, too.\n\n307\n00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.820\nBut the Software Update\nis what I care about.\n\n308\n00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.310\nSo, it's gonna move that over.\n\n309\n00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.980\nAnd what I'll see is on the storage drive,\nI'll now have a library and\n\n310\n00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.100\nin that library I'll have a Server folder,\nright.\n\n311\n00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.540\nSo that's where it's creating it and\nin there,\n\n312\n00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:00.230\nwe'll start to see Software Update and\nthe other things that moved along with it.\n\n313\n00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:01.760\nSo that's what's going on there.\n\n314\n00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.670\nSo once that's done, now I can actually\nget the Software Update server configured.\n\n315\n00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:06.770\nGetting configured's not so hard.\n\n316\n00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:10.020\nWe really do just turn it on and\nthen tell it to download the updates.\n\n317\n00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.260\nAll right, so there we go,\nnow it's moved over.\n\n318\n00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.820\nAnd so now I can go down here\nto my Software Updates server.\n\n319\n00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.260\nAnd, I've set it to manual mode because\nI want to manually approve updates.\n\n320\n00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.160\nThat's what we normally want,\nand I'm gonna turn it on.\n\n321\n00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.265\nAs soon as that's turned on, I am now\nofficially a Software Update server.\n\n322\n00:14:27.265 --> 00:14:30.850\nAnd once a day,\nmy server's gonna reach out to Apple and\n\n323\n00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:32.340\nask for new updates and download them.\n\n324\n00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.710\nI don't have to wait on Apple though,\nI can force it.\n\n325\n00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:38.700\nIf you go to the updates tab, you'll\nsee all of the updates that you've got.\n\n326\n00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:45.360\nBy default it's gonna reach out to Apple\nand get a list of the available updates.\n\n327\n00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.970\nIf you check this box right here, it's\nnot only gonna learn about the update but\n\n328\n00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:51.630\nit's gonna download it also.\n\n329\n00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:54.280\nNow, normally I would check that.\n\n330\n00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.628\nI would check it and say go ahead and\ndownload the update so we've got it.\n\n331\n00:14:56.628 --> 00:15:00.380\nBut because this show is\nonly 30 minutes long,\n\n332\n00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:04.820\nI don't wanna check that cuz it takes\nlike two days to download all the updates\n\n333\n00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.280\ndepending on your internet connection.\n\n334\n00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.480\nWe're on an 80 megabit connection and\nit takes us about two days to get it.\n\n335\n00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.890\nSo you might not want to\ndownload all of them, right?\n\n336\n00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:17.760\nWhen you download all the updates,\nyou'll find that it's getting updates for\n\n337\n00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.310\nlaptops that haven't been sold for\nten years.\n\n338\n00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:25.190\nIt's getting updates not just for El\nCapitan but for Yosemite, and Mavericks,\n\n339\n00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.452\nand Mountain Lion, and Snow Leopard.\n\n340\n00:15:27.452 --> 00:15:29.670\nAnd OSs that you might not\neven be deploying anymore.\n\n341\n00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.910\nIt's getting a lot of stuff\nthat you might not want.\n\n342\n00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:34.770\nSo you can always go through and pick and\nchoose the ones that you want, too.\n\n343\n00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.360\nYou just don't check that box and\nthen you pick what you want to download.\n\n344\n00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.400\nI'm gonna leave it off\nhere just to save time.\n\n345\n00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.320\nAnd then down at the bottom, I'm gonna\nhit the little gear and under the gear,\n\n346\n00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.980\nyou'll see where I've got Check for\nUpdates.\n\n347\n00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.660\nSo I can force it to check for\nupdates right now, okay?\n\n348\n00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.410\nSo it's gonna start checking for\nthose updates.\n\n349\n00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:54.204\nAnd this list will populate with\nthe updates when it finds them, okay?\n\n350\n00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:58.289\nNow you can sit here and hit command\nR over and over and over again, and\n\n351\n00:15:58.289 --> 00:16:02.308\nwhat you're going to see is,\nReading Updates for a little while And\n\n352\n00:16:02.308 --> 00:16:06.213\nthen it's going to change to\nactually show the updates, right.\n\n353\n00:16:06.213 --> 00:16:07.300\nIt takes a little bit though.\n\n354\n00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.420\nSo I'm going to give it some time.\n\n355\n00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.490\nWhile I wait on it,\nI'll show you some other things.\n\n356\n00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.080\nBut what reading updates means is it.\n\n357\n00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.400\nI'd say it's going to take some time but\nit's already done.\n\n358\n00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.608\nBut it's downloading\na catalog file from Apple and\n\n359\n00:16:17.608 --> 00:16:20.750\nthen it's going to process that\ncatalog file and integrate it locally.\n\n360\n00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.550\nSo I can briefly fast.\n\n361\n00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:26.230\n>> Yeah I was going to make a comment\nlike it must really be magical.\n\n362\n00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.450\n>> I've seen it take 15,\n20 minutes sometime.\n\n363\n00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.400\nThat was really the fastest it's ever\nhappened for me, so it's impressive.\n\n364\n00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.470\nSo anyhow it got it really fast.\n\n365\n00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.730\nLook at some of the things that\nare showing up here, right.\n\n366\n00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:38.100\nLike this guy right over here.\n\n367\n00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.980\nHere's a VoiceOver Kit for iPod.\n\n368\n00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:46.400\nIt's an update that was released May 21st,\n2012, that's four years ago, right.\n\n369\n00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.110\nSo these are some updates that I might\nnot have any iPods in my company\n\n370\n00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.980\nI don't wanna download an iPod update,\nright?\n\n371\n00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.100\nSo I don't necessarily wanna get that.\n\n372\n00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.280\nBut other ones are updates that are very,\nvery recent.\n\n373\n00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.440\nI usually come in here and sort by dates.\n\n374\n00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:05.940\nAnd you'll see there's updates all the way\nback to 2005, 11 years ago, right?\n\n375\n00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.805\nDo I need the QuickTime Broadcaster?\n\n376\n00:17:08.805 --> 00:17:12.660\n[LAUGH] Probably not, I don't even know\nwhat the QuickTime Broadcaster is.\n\n377\n00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.380\nBut if we sorted it the other way by date,\nI can see updates that came out,\n\n378\n00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.320\nwhat is that, yesterday?\n\n379\n00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.850\nYep, May 11, 2016, that's yesterday.\n\n380\n00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:22.500\nHere's an update that came in out for\nthe SafeViewUAT.\n\n381\n00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.580\nOr a Safari Technology Preview.\n\n382\n00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:28.790\nI might now want to use the previews, so\nI might not want to download that, but,\n\n383\n00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.750\nall the ones in here might\nbe really important.\n\n384\n00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:34.900\nSee, we'll see like Bootcamp updates,\nthose are important if I'm using Bootcamp,\n\n385\n00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.260\nI need the latest Windows\ndrivers that are out there.\n\n386\n00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:41.470\nThere's that digital camera compatibility\nupdate we saw in the caching episode,\n\n387\n00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:45.070\nyou'll see updates in here that\nare really important like these,\n\n388\n00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:49.340\nthe OS X El Capitan update for 10.11.4.\n\n389\n00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.130\nI'm running 10.11.3 right now,\nI need this update,\n\n390\n00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:56.700\nthere's three different version of it,\n1.1 gigs, 1.5 gigs and 2.8 gigs, right?\n\n391\n00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.780\nWhy the different sizes?\n\n392\n00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:03.562\nWell, one is an update if\nI've already got 10.11.3.\n\n393\n00:18:03.562 --> 00:18:06.600\nOne's an update if I have\n10.11.0 through 10.11.2.\n\n394\n00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.540\nAnd then one's an update\nif I'm still running 10.10,\n\n395\n00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.980\nwhich would be Yosemite, and\nI'm about to upgrade El Capitan.\n\n396\n00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.490\nI'd need the full 2.8 gig\none to do that update.\n\n397\n00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:20.090\nSo different versions of the same\nupdate that are different sizes and\n\n398\n00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:21.700\nI can pick and choose amongst those.\n\n399\n00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:26.110\n>> One of the things you stress\nbetween two different servers there,\n\n400\n00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:27.630\nyou know, the caching server,\n\n401\n00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.700\nthe software update server is\nthe fact that it saves us bandwidth.\n\n402\n00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.320\nNow on the initial setup, Don,\n\n403\n00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.130\nhere are we going to have to worry that\nmaybe it will choose bandwidth, or\n\n404\n00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:39.460\nchew up your bandwidth or\nversus maybe just everybody going out\n\n405\n00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.630\ninitially to the Internet anyways,\nwould it kind of balance itself out?\n\n406\n00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.000\n>> So if you download these updates,\n\n407\n00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.780\nit's the equivalent bandwidth of one\nperson going and downloading the updates.\n\n408\n00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.970\nThe difference is no one person is\ngonna download all these updates.\n\n409\n00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.010\nSo if I had checked that\nautomatically download,\n\n410\n00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.730\nit would start downloading all of these.\n\n411\n00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:58.120\nI don't normally worry about saturating\nbandwidth though because Apple only has so\n\n412\n00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:58.680\nmuch bandwidth.\n\n413\n00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.700\nSo even though you might have a 100-meg\nInternet connection, you're only gonna\n\n414\n00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.090\nbe downloading from Apple at like two or\nthree megabytes right.\n\n415\n00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:06.940\nSo it's not gonna saturate your line and\n\n416\n00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.010\nit could take a couple of days to\ndownload the whole collection.\n\n417\n00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:11.680\nSo I don't normally sweat that and\n\n418\n00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.890\nit is about the same as people just\ngoing out and downloading it themselves.\n\n419\n00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.970\nI'm gonna pick a small update though so\nit'll go a little faster.\n\n420\n00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.250\nI'm gonna pick that digital camera update\nthat I know my system needs right.\n\n421\n00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.290\nThere's that\nDigital Camera RAW Compatibility Update.\n\n422\n00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.310\nAnd over here,\nI can see its current status.\n\n423\n00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.960\nThe status is that it's available, right.\n\n424\n00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.340\nAnd if I hit the drop-down box,\nI can choose Download, and\n\n425\n00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.210\nI can choose Download and Enable.\n\n426\n00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:38.150\nIf I choose Download, it's gonna download\na copy of that update from Apple and\n\n427\n00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:41.090\nit's gonna store it in my hard drive,\nmy hard drive storage, right.\n\n428\n00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.040\nSo it's waiting right now,\nit's gonna reach out to Apple, and\n\n429\n00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.240\nit's gonna download it.\n\n430\n00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.890\nI might do the same thing for\nlike the El Captain 10.11.4 update.\n\n431\n00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:51.640\nSo I can come here and\ntell it to download those too.\n\n432\n00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.090\nNow I'm not enabling them so\nwhat does that mean?\n\n433\n00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:57.740\nWell, its gonna download them and\nthey're just gonna sit here.\n\n434\n00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:02.335\nSo I can then choose,\nmaybe after I test 10.11.4, I can say,\n\n435\n00:20:02.335 --> 00:20:04.041\nall right, well it's safe.\n\n436\n00:20:04.041 --> 00:20:07.300\nLet me go ahead approve that for\neverybody to get it.\n\n437\n00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:13.570\nAnd when I change it from downloading or\nfrom downloaded to enabled,\n\n438\n00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.990\nnow people are going to be able to\ninstall that update and use it, but\n\n439\n00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:20.140\nI've got a way for it to download\nthat update and get installed.\n\n440\n00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.340\nOkay, and then once a day this\nlist is gonna get updated and\n\n441\n00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.390\nI just need to come through and test and\napprove test and approve that's the way\n\n442\n00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.430\nyou're supposed to this the kind\nof a life cycle that you follow.\n\n443\n00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:32.530\nAssuming everything's\ngood we can roll it out.\n\n444\n00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:36.320\nNow at this point, it's still downloading,\nit'll take a little bit of time, again I\n\n445\n00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.750\ncan sit here and refresh the screen over\nand over again or I can just wait and\n\n446\n00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:43.040\nit'll finish, but it's going to download\nthat and I can then choose to enable it.\n\n447\n00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.180\nOnce you enable an update,\nso I've got enable,\n\n448\n00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.690\nI can also disable the update, if I\nspecifically want to block this update so\n\n449\n00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:54.990\nthat nobody in my company gets it,\nI can disable and now it's taken care of.\n\n450\n00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:56.660\nNobody else will be able to get it.\n\n451\n00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.630\n>> Now Don why would\nyou disable an update?\n\n452\n00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.150\nThat's the purpose of\nthe software update server.\n\n453\n00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:03.610\nWhy would you disable one?\n\n454\n00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.470\n>> Sometimes you can have\nan update that breaks software.\n\n455\n00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:09.000\nSo for example where I see this\nthe most are the major updates.\n\n456\n00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.785\nYou might have Yosemite, fully deployed\nthroughout your environment and\n\n457\n00:21:13.785 --> 00:21:15.600\nEl Capitan comes out.\n\n458\n00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.260\nWell, your end users could update\nto El Capitan whenever they want.\n\n459\n00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.680\nIt's an update, right from Apple,\nit doesn't cost any money.\n\n460\n00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.930\nYou might want to block that,\n\n461\n00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:25.230\nbecause you might have third party\nsoftware that doesn't work on El Capitan.\n\n462\n00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:27.930\nSo you block it to keep\nyour users at Yosemite, and\n\n463\n00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:31.480\nit's only once you've approved it, would\nyou then authorize to go to El Capitan.\n\n464\n00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.970\nSo it's usually because of\nthird party software, but\n\n465\n00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:36.800\nsometimes it can be Apple's own software,\nsomething changes.\n\n466\n00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.610\nIn El Capitan they introduced\na new security feature that\n\n467\n00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:43.190\nwas called\nthe System Integrity Protection.\n\n468\n00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.860\nAnd that might cause problems\nwith the ways that your\n\n469\n00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.100\nusers are used to using their computer.\n\n470\n00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.720\nSo you might want to hold off on that.\n\n471\n00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.620\nSo, those are examples of where\nwe might want to disable.\n\n472\n00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.770\n>> Now you mentioned disabling\nsomething like that if somebody is\n\n473\n00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:59.970\nout running Yosemite, but\nthat's a specific set of computers.\n\n474\n00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:04.090\nWhat if I have an update that maybe I only\nwant to distribute to a specific set of\n\n475\n00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:04.590\ncomputers?\n\n476\n00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.230\nIs there a way that we can perform that?\n\n477\n00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:08.160\n>> That's a little harder, right.\n\n478\n00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.280\nLet's say that you want\nto have a test group.\n\n479\n00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.780\nSo I say I've got 1,000 computers,\nI'm gonna pick these ten,\n\n480\n00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.270\nI want them to be my test bed.\n\n481\n00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:18.150\nWhat you would need to do is set\nup two software update servers,\n\n482\n00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:21.360\none software update server that\nwas just for the test group, and\n\n483\n00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.040\nanother software server that was for\neverybody else.\n\n484\n00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.280\nAnd so on the test group, you'd approve\nthings really fast and then you'd wait\n\n485\n00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.050\na little while and then approve it on\nthe other server for everybody else.\n\n486\n00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:35.050\nUnlike the cashing server, clients aren't\ngonna automatically find your system.\n\n487\n00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:38.260\nYou've gotta register your clients\nto use the software update server.\n\n488\n00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.270\nSo I've gotta tell them,\nif I go to my other client,\n\n489\n00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:41.640\nlet me just jump back to this other guy.\n\n490\n00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.680\nSo here's a stock El Capitan install,\nit's on the same network as my server.\n\n491\n00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.880\nIt's not gonna use the server.\n\n492\n00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.520\nIt's gonna update from Apple.\n\n493\n00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.480\nThat's the way it works,\nunless I register it.\n\n494\n00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.930\nAnd to register it, I've gotta go into\nthe terminal and this is far easier if you\n\n495\n00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:58.970\nhave profile manager or\nif you have Apple remote desktop.\n\n496\n00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:02.180\nIf you have a profile manager, you can\njust put it in your profile manager.\n\n497\n00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.690\nYou can push a profile that sets\nthe software update server.\n\n498\n00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:07.130\nI showed that in the profile\nmanager episode.\n\n499\n00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:10.310\nIf you have Apple remote desktop, the\ncommand button that you can push from ard,\n\n500\n00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:12.600\nand you can push out to\nall your machines at once.\n\n501\n00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.130\nBut I'm gonna do it by hand here.\n\n502\n00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:18.340\nIf I want to register this client\nto use my software update server,\n\n503\n00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.440\nwhat I need to do is I need\nto issue this command.\n\n504\n00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:24.754\nI need to say sudo,\nbecause you have to be an administrator,\n\n505\n00:23:24.754 --> 00:23:28.491\ndefaults write, so\nI'm changing a default value.\n\n506\n00:23:28.491 --> 00:23:32.113\nNormally this would be a system preference\nbut there's no graphical user interface\n\n507\n00:23:32.113 --> 00:23:34.521\nfor this setting,\nI've got to do it from command line.\n\n508\n00:23:34.521 --> 00:23:37.026\nSo I'm gonna write to\n\n509\n00:23:37.026 --> 00:23:45.260\n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUp-\ndate.plist.\n\n510\n00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.960\nSo I'm writing into that preference list.\n\n511\n00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.010\nAnd the value,\nyou can actually leave plist off.\n\n512\n00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:52.753\nYou don't have to have that, but\nit doesn't hurt to have that either.\n\n513\n00:23:52.753 --> 00:23:56.127\nI'm gonna write to the catalog URL.\n\n514\n00:23:56.127 --> 00:23:58.367\nThat's where the software\nupdate catalog is.\n\n515\n00:23:58.367 --> 00:24:00.220\nAnd it normally points to Apple.\n\n516\n00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.682\nI'm going to point it.\n\n517\n00:24:01.682 --> 00:24:07.343\nTo osx dash server01\nwhich is my server colon\n\n518\n00:24:07.343 --> 00:24:13.840\n8088 slash Catalogs dot su catalog, right?\n\n519\n00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.795\nThat's gonna tell it don't look at apple,\nlook at this software update server.\n\n520\n00:24:17.795 --> 00:24:20.882\nAnd if I had 2 software update servers,\na test one, and a production one,\n\n521\n00:24:20.882 --> 00:24:23.724\nI'd point the test machines at\nthe test software update server, and\n\n522\n00:24:23.724 --> 00:24:26.265\nthe production machines\nat the production server.\n\n523\n00:24:26.265 --> 00:24:28.870\nAnd now when they go to check for updates,\n\n524\n00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:33.170\ninstead of going to Apple, they're\ngonna go to my software update server.\n\n525\n00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:35.440\n>> Don, okay, so we've run that command,\n\n526\n00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:40.410\nthe output looks absolutely amazing and\nmight I just take your word for\n\n527\n00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:42.490\nit or is there a way that we\ncan verify that it works?\n\n528\n00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:44.310\n>> You can verify,\nit might already be set, right?\n\n529\n00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.720\nYou could look in that P-list file.\n\n530\n00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.980\nThe P-list file is a binary file, so\nit's a little hard to look inside it, so\n\n531\n00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.220\nyou can use like Plutil.\n\n532\n00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.140\nAnd do a dash p,\nwhich will print the preferences.\n\n533\n00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.120\nAnd we can look in that\nsame file that we just set.\n\n534\n00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.759\nSo I can pull that up,\nand pull it from there.\n\n535\n00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.860\nThere we go.\n\n536\n00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.870\nSo I'm basically just saying PLU Til dash\nP, so print the contents of the file.\n\n537\n00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:12.250\nAnd I'm pointing that at\nsoftware update at P list file.\n\n538\n00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:15.400\nand when I run that,\nit's gonna show me my settings.\n\n539\n00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.110\nAnd what I'm looking for is catalog URL.\n\n540\n00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:19.760\nSo right there,\nI can see where I'm pointed at my server.\n\n541\n00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.310\nIf I see that missing,\nI'm pointing at apple.\n\n542\n00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.180\nOr I can see that I'm pointing to\nthe tests, the production servers.\n\n543\n00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.740\nSo you can kinda query that and\n\n544\n00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.980\nsee it even though it's\ntucked away in a binary file.\n\n545\n00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:32.090\nSo that's the command right there,\nall right?\n\n546\n00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:34.570\nSo I'm now set to use that server.\n\n547\n00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.770\nSo from now on, when I fire up\nsomething like the app store, right?\n\n548\n00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:41.580\nSo I launch the app store and\nI go to the update tab,\n\n549\n00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:46.060\ninstead of reaching out to Apple,\nit's reaching to my update server.\n\n550\n00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.780\nAnd my update server is\ngoing to tell it what to do.\n\n551\n00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.350\nNow this Mac is running 10.11.3.\n\n552\n00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:55.740\nIf it had phoned home to Apple,\nApple would tell it 10.11.4 is out and\n\n553\n00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:59.960\nit would tell me I need\nthat digital camera update.\n\n554\n00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.370\nBut instead I get no updates available.\n\n555\n00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:06.570\nBecause I haven't approved\nany updates on my server yet.\n\n556\n00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:10.400\nAnd when I go back to my server,\nwell, it's still waiting,\n\n557\n00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.620\nwhy is it still waiting?\n\n558\n00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.760\nSo apparently it's gonna take\nits time downloading that,\n\n559\n00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.150\nit's probably still\nprocessing the other list.\n\n560\n00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:15.790\nList in the background.\n\n561\n00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.490\nRemember I said it could take awhile.\n\n562\n00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:18.650\nIt is, yup.\n\n563\n00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:23.430\nSo a minute ago we were on here, it said\n860 updates, now it says 1202 updates.\n\n564\n00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.690\nIt's still downloading the list.\n\n565\n00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.030\nRemember, how I said this was\nthe fastest I've ever seen it?\n\n566\n00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.500\nThat's cuz it hadn't\nfinished loading the list.\n\n567\n00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:34.370\nIt's got to fish loading the list of\nupdates, before it can download new ones.\n\n568\n00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:39.810\nBut once this one is downloaded, I can\ncome in and choose it and choose enable.\n\n569\n00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:42.160\nAnd when I enable that update,\n\n570\n00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.870\nnow its enabled for\npeople to be able to get, okay?\n\n571\n00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:48.670\nAnd so people will be able to\npull that update and get it.\n\n572\n00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:52.260\nAnd actually, the update did\nswitch to downloading, whoops.\n\n573\n00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.720\nIt's not exactly what I wanted.\n\n574\n00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.840\nSo the status did switch to downloading.\n\n575\n00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.060\nIt's gonna download in a minute.\n\n576\n00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:01.390\nAnd as soon as it downloads, I've enabled\nit, it's going to be available for\n\n577\n00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:02.800\npeople to get.\n\n578\n00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:07.260\nAnd now, when I switch over to them,\nI just got an error.\n\n579\n00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:11.310\nBut when I switch over to them and do\nan update, it's going to see that update,\n\n580\n00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:14.490\nit's going to show up here, it'll be able\nto pull from that software update server.\n\n581\n00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:18.440\nSo that's kind of the key thing is\nthat we have to approve it first, and\n\n582\n00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.360\nthen they'll show up here and\nwe'll get those updates.\n\n583\n00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.370\n>> Now Don, what if you've handed\nthis server over to me and\n\n584\n00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:25.070\nI've decided to pull down some updates and\n\n585\n00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:30.800\nunfortunately I've got that Do you\nknow what is a 2005 iOS update.\n\n586\n00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.010\nAnd we know that's completely obsolete for\nme.\n\n587\n00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:37.270\nIs there anyway that I can remove that\nfrom the database if I don't need it?\n\n588\n00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:37.830\n>> You can.\n\n589\n00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:41.330\nIf it's just an individual updates,\nyou can go right here through the updates.\n\n590\n00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:44.520\nSo let's take this camera\nupdate as an example, right?\n\n591\n00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.500\nWhen you choose an update like\nthis You can come down here and\n\n592\n00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.490\nhit the little gear,\nand see you got Remove.\n\n593\n00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:54.340\nAnd so you can remove an individual\nupdate and pull that out and\n\n594\n00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.330\nget rid of it,\nif it's just one or two things.\n\n595\n00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:01.260\nIf you've got a ton, you can actually\nhighlight more than one update at a time,\n\n596\n00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.160\nand you can hit the gear and\nhit Remove and go that way.\n\n597\n00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.810\nSo you can pull individual ones if you\nneed, you can pull groups if you need.\n\n598\n00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:11.470\nIf you wanna purge the whole thing,\nthere's not a great way to do it.\n\n599\n00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:12.910\nIf you try and highlight them all,\n\n600\n00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:16.830\nthe system gets really wonky to\napply to 1200 updates all at once.\n\n601\n00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:19.980\nSo it doesn't really like that very much.\n\n602\n00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:23.120\nSo if you wanna purge them all,\nthere is a terminal command you can run.\n\n603\n00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.850\nWhich I'm not gonna run it here cuz\nit will freak my system out, but\n\n604\n00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.122\nI can at least show you the command.\n\n605\n00:28:27.122 --> 00:28:35.009\nIt's sudo severadmin\nswupdate:PurgeUnused = yes.\n\n606\n00:28:35.009 --> 00:28:40.710\nAnd what that can do is say,\n\n607\n00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:47.770\nif there's an update in here that's not\nactually supported by apple anymore Right.\n\n608\n00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:51.290\nIf it's a really old one that's not\nsupported by them, we can purge it and\n\n609\n00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:51.850\nget it out of there.\n\n610\n00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:53.890\nAnd that will wipe them out and\ntake those out.\n\n611\n00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:57.450\nI don't normally use these cuz you\ncan just go and have them in batches.\n\n612\n00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:58.990\nI normally sort by date.\n\n613\n00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:03.900\nIf it's something really old,\nolder than the oldest system I have.\n\n614\n00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.380\nJust because you have old systems doesn't\nmean you don't wanna update them anymore.\n\n615\n00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.300\nIf I still have max\nthat are ten years old,\n\n616\n00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.120\nI need those updates from ten years ago.\n\n617\n00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:10.830\nRight?\n\n618\n00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:15.070\nBut if I know that the oldest Mac on my\nnetwork is five years old, I just go into\n\n619\n00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:20.040\nthe update list, sort by date, and look\nfor things that are five years or older.\n\n620\n00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:24.040\nSo I can come in here, and\nI can say we're in the year 2016.\n\n621\n00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.850\nSo maybe I decide anything prior\nto 2012 I'm gonna get rid of.\n\n622\n00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:33.160\nSo I can sort and come in here and\nfind 2012 in the list.\n\n623\n00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.490\nI can pick 2011.\n\n624\n00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.210\nAnd I'll go all the way back and\nhighlight those.\n\n625\n00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:41.290\nAnd now we can go in and we can\nremove them if they were downloaded.\n\n626\n00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:43.790\nIn my case, I haven't downloaded them so\nI can't remove them.\n\n627\n00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.430\nBut if I had I could remove them this way.\n\n628\n00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.110\nAnd now we save that disk space.\n\n629\n00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.870\n>> Thank you, Don.\nA lot\n\n630\n00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.340\nof great information in this\nsoftware update server.\n\n631\n00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.360\nA lot of configurations and\ndefinitely considerations, if you will,\n\n632\n00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.170\nthat you have to take into account before\nyou are going to deploy the software\n\n633\n00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:57.990\nupdate server in your environment.\n\n634\n00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:02.610\nDon, I do see that we're pressing\nthe luck on the time clock again.\n\n635\n00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:04.320\nSo we are gonna rap this one up.\n\n636\n00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.650\nBut before we do,\nCody you have any parting words?\n\n637\n00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:09.340\n>> All right, when it comes down to\nthat choice between caching server and\n\n638\n00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.030\nsoftware updates,\nI do normally pick software updates.\n\n639\n00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:14.620\nWe wanna roll out our software\nupdates as fast as possible.\n\n640\n00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:17.450\nBut we also wanna test them to make\nsure it doesn't break our network.\n\n641\n00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:19.970\nThe software update server let's you\ndo that, the caching server does not.\n\n642\n00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:23.220\nSo given a choice, I normally\npick software update server, but\n\n643\n00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:28.240\nremember, the main benefit of the caching\nserver, is it works without configuration.\n\n644\n00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.740\nIt's automatic, and it catches apps and\nbook purchases, too.\n\n645\n00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.880\nSo it can get a lot more things.\n\n646\n00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.110\nThose app store apps,\nthey can really add up.\n\n647\n00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:39.130\nIt can be a lot of bandwidth sometimes.\n\n648\n00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:40.200\nYou get that with a catching server.\n\n649\n00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.630\nYou don't with software update,\nbut the trade-off is that control.\n\n650\n00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:45.620\nI would rather have\ncontrol of the updates.\n\n651\n00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.340\nThe software server update\nis the way to do it.\n\n652\n00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.630\n>> Well Don, thank you for\nthat information and that advice.\n\n653\n00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.510\nAnd thank you to you the viewer for\nwatching.\n\n654\n00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:53.890\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign out here at ITPro TV.\n\n655\n00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:55.370\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n656\n00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:56.135\n>> And I'm Don Piset.\n\n657\n00:30:56.135 --> 00:30:58.154\n>> And we'll see ya next

00:00:18.510\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and in today's\nepisode we are continuing through\n\n4\n00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.070\nour Mac OS 10 server essentials and\n\n5\n00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.040\nwe are looking at implementing\ndeployment solution.\n\n6\n00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.581\nMore specifically we are focusing on\ndeploying with net install we have none\n\n7\n00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:29.640\nother than Mr. Don presenting this to you.\n\n8\n00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.719\nDon how are you doing sir?\n\n9\n00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:33.578\n>> I'm doing great, Wes ready to jump\nright back into OS 10 server and\n\n10\n00:00:33.578 --> 00:00:36.487\nlike Wes said, in this episode\nwe're gonna be tackling NetInstall,\n\n11\n00:00:36.487 --> 00:00:38.550\nwhich is one of the neater technologies.\n\n12\n00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.360\nIt's another one of those technologies\nwhere if you have a small environment,\n\n13\n00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.550\nyou have your own machine, you're using\nfour or five machines, you won't need it.\n\n14\n00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.650\nAnd so you may not have used it.\n\n15\n00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.270\nBut if you have hundreds or thousands or\n\n16\n00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.090\ntens of thousands of machines,\nNetInstall is essential.\n\n17\n00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.995\nSo what is NetInstall?\n\n18\n00:00:54.995 --> 00:01:00.040\nWell, the basis of it it's a simple and\neasy method\n\n19\n00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.640\nto install OS X, and on as many machines\nas you need very, very quickly, right?\n\n20\n00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.380\nThink of it in terms of there's\na few different used scenarios, but\n\n21\n00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.909\nlet me give you one.\n\n22\n00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.953\nLet's say that last year,\nyou bought a thousand max and\n\n23\n00:01:14.953 --> 00:01:19.060\neveryone of them came with Yosemite,\nright.\n\n24\n00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.692\n10.10 Yosemite.\n\n25\n00:01:20.692 --> 00:01:25.240\nAnd now 10.11 El Capitan is out and\nyou want to upgrade now.\n\n26\n00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.180\nAnd you decide I wish it more upgrade now\nI like to format them so they're erased\n\n27\n00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.400\nand put El Capitan is nice and clean and\nthey've all got a fresh install.\n\n28\n00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.220\nWell in the past,\n\n29\n00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.050\nwhat you'd have to do is make your little\nUSB install key, go machine to machine.\n\n30\n00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.530\nPlugging it in and after you get plugged\ninto those machines they boot it up and\n\n31\n00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.130\nwell now you do the install.\n\n32\n00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.450\nBut you have to do it by hand.\n\n33\n00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.780\nIf you had a thousand machines\nyou wouldn't do them all at once.\n\n34\n00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.330\nYou would need a thousand USB key or\nyou need one person with a lot\n\n35\n00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.400\nof patience to be able to go machine,\nto machine to machine.\n\n36\n00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.180\nWell what NetInstall does, is NetInstall\nsays let's get rid of that USB key, and\n\n37\n00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.240\nlet's make this happen over the network.\n\n38\n00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.190\nIt allows a Mac boot up not only\nfrom its on hard drive, but\n\n39\n00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.870\nto boot up from the network.\n\n40\n00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.280\nAnd reach out there and\nfind an installation image of OS 10.\n\n41\n00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.090\nAnd install it on the computer.\n\n42\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.720\nI know what you might be thinking which\nis, we can already do that with Apple.\n\n43\n00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.220\nWhen you boot a Mac,\nyou can hold command r.\n\n44\n00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.728\nWhen you boot and hold r, it tries boot\nto recovery, but when you do command r,\n\n45\n00:02:27.728 --> 00:02:31.664\nI'm sorry, actually, it's command r to\nboot to recovery and it's command, shift,\n\n46\n00:02:31.664 --> 00:02:32.760\nr, there we go.\n\n47\n00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.570\nThat tells us to do Internet recovery.\n\n48\n00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.200\nAnd with Internet recovery it\nactually reaches out to Apple,\n\n49\n00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.790\nconnects to them, and you can install\nOS 10 right from Apple, fresh and\n\n50\n00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.220\nclean on your machine without any\ndata on your hard drive what so ever.\n\n51\n00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.440\nSo why would I want to set that up myself?\n\n52\n00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.970\nWell, if you've ever done the install from\nApple you've probably noticed one thing,\n\n53\n00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.320\nand that is it's slow.\n\n54\n00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.540\nIt doesn't matter how fast\nyour Internet connection is.\n\n55\n00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.680\nApple only has so much bandwidth on\ntheir end to be able to support it.\n\n56\n00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.310\nAnd so it's slow.\n\n57\n00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.640\nDoing a NetInstall from Apple servers\nvia the Internet will take hours.\n\n58\n00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.710\nBut, if you set up your own server,\non your local area network,\n\n59\n00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.260\nyour network is likely considerably faster\nthan what you're going to have available\n\n60\n00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.540\nall the way to Apple, and\n\n61\n00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.330\nyou'll be able to do these deployments\nin 10 to 15 minutes, very, very quickly.\n\n62\n00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.760\nSo, think of a school where\nyou might have a computer lab.\n\n63\n00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.560\nSo you've got a lab of 30 computers and\na bunch of kids get in there.\n\n64\n00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.730\nAnd at the end of the day\nthe machines are just trashed.\n\n65\n00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.520\nThere's software loaded on them,\nwallpapers are changed,\n\n66\n00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.380\nall sorts of stuff is junked up.\n\n67\n00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.050\nYou can erase the entire room and\n\n68\n00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.050\nhave nice clean OS 10 installs\ndone in 15 to 20 minutes.\n\n69\n00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.020\nIt can be done that quickly.\n\n70\n00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.300\nIt's very, very fast.\n\n71\n00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.060\nYou would just have to\nwalk to each machine and\n\n72\n00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.090\ntell them to boot off the network,\nand then pick that install image.\n\n73\n00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.170\n>> And\nwhen I do reset those computers like that,\n\n74\n00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.800\nDon, what about the applications?\n\n75\n00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.070\nAm I gonna have to go back and\nreinstall all the applications as well?\n\n76\n00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.660\n>> Well, it depends on what we do.\n\n77\n00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.560\nNow with NetInstall, there's actually\nthree different versions of NetInstall.\n\n78\n00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.100\nThis is where it gets a little confusing.\n\n79\n00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.200\nThe exam focuses truly on what's\nactually called NetInstall,\n\n80\n00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.440\nwhich is doing a straight\nup El Capitan install.\n\n81\n00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.620\nAnd if you format the computer and\nyou do a straightup install of El Capitan,\n\n82\n00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.360\nall your applications are gone.\n\n83\n00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.490\nAll your data is gone.\n\n84\n00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.530\nIt's a fresh and clean install,\nso you lost your information.\n\n85\n00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.230\nAll right, so yes you have to reinstall\nthat and that's not necessarily ideal.\n\n86\n00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.340\nIf you have a computer lab all set up for\nstudents and\n\n87\n00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.650\nthey're going to be using these\nmachines to run some application.\n\n88\n00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.300\nThe application is now gone.\n\n89\n00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.330\nYou've gotta fix that and there's\na few ways you can go about it, right.\n\n90\n00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.010\nWe could use third party or\n\n91\n00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.840\nother systems like Apple Remote Desktop to\npush the applications back but, there's\n\n92\n00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.550\nactually another form of that install\ncalled Net Restore that we can use and\n\n93\n00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.160\nwhat Net Restore does Is it allows us to\ndeploy El Capitan over the network also,\n\n94\n00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.650\nbut it allows us to do it\nwith a modified image.\n\n95\n00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.900\nApple has one image, right?\n\n96\n00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.940\nApple has the image of the fresh and clean\nEl Capitan install that we've all seen\n\n97\n00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.800\non a new laptop or\ndesktop that we've purchased with it.\n\n98\n00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.330\nBut with Net Restore,\nyou take that image and you customize it.\n\n99\n00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.620\nYou build it up to add\nexactly what you want.\n\n100\n00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.080\nYou put the applications in there, you put\nthe web browser you want, whatever it is.\n\n101\n00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.980\nYou put everything in there\njust the way you want it and\n\n102\n00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.620\nthen you create an installation\nimage based on that.\n\n103\n00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.830\nAnd, now, once you've got that\ninstallation image based on that\n\n104\n00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.950\nkind of source system,\nthey call it a template system.\n\n105\n00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.700\nSo, you take a MacBook,\nor an iMac, Mac mini,\n\n106\n00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.350\nwhatever it is, and\nyou us set it the way the want and\n\n107\n00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.000\nyou take an image, you make an\ninstallation image based on that computer.\n\n108\n00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.360\nAnd now you could roll that out to\nthousands of other machines and\n\n109\n00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.930\nthey all have the same applications\nwith the same configurations, and\n\n110\n00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.080\nif the junked put you jus re-deploy.\n\n111\n00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.870\nAnd that'll put right back\nto the way they were.\n\n112\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.850\nThey've got everything set\nset in the way that you want.\n\n113\n00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.650\nAnd that's called NetRestore.\n\n114\n00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.430\nAnd for me, I find that NetRestore\nis the one I almost always use.\n\n115\n00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.370\nNetInstall is nice, but NetRestore,\nboy, that's even better.\n\n116\n00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.440\nNow it's got all the applications\npackage with it, and\n\n117\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.250\nso that's probably the one\nyou'll use more often.\n\n118\n00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.380\n>> Now with NetInstall and NetRestore,\nDon, is it decentralized or\n\n119\n00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.150\nis it something that we\ncan centrally manage, or\n\n120\n00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.550\ndo we have to go somewhere\nelse to do central management.\n\n121\n00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.890\n>> It's kind of a bit of both, right.\n\n122\n00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.410\nAs far as management,\nit's all done through the server app.\n\n123\n00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.300\nSo we've got the OS10\nserver app that we fire up.\n\n124\n00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.520\nYou build a NetInstall server.\n\n125\n00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.110\nIt doesn't matter if you're\ndoing NetInstall or net restore.\n\n126\n00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.330\nThey're all done from the same place\nthrough the NetInstall server.\n\n127\n00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.080\nAnd so you can go into that one place and\n\n128\n00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.170\nmanage your images, but you can have\nmore than one NetInstall server.\n\n129\n00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.090\nAnd in fact, there's several\nreasons why you'd want that.\n\n130\n00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.970\nIf you've got a headquarters and 50 branch\noffices, well those branch offices,\n\n131\n00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.450\nthey're not gonna see the NetInstall\nserver at your headquarters.\n\n132\n00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.790\nAnd even if they did, they'd be\ncopying the image over the Internet.\n\n133\n00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.030\nThat's not necessarily gonna be fast.\n\n134\n00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.330\nSo you'll probably want more than\none NetInstall server out there.\n\n135\n00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.420\nAnd if you have more than\none NetInstall server,\n\n136\n00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.600\nyou're not really centralized any more.\n\n137\n00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.780\nNow you're decentralized.\n\n138\n00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.610\nNow it's kind of spread out and you get\ndifferent servers for different places.\n\n139\n00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.370\nNot, and that can be a little\nbit difficult to manage.\n\n140\n00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.560\nWe'll see a little bit of\nthat later in the show.\n\n141\n00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.440\nBut you can go that way.\n\n142\n00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.390\nIf you just install one\nNetInstall server though.\n\n143\n00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.610\nIt is centralized though.\n\n144\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.770\nIt's all right there in one place.\n\n145\n00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.650\nI only mentioned two of\nthe forms of NetIntstall.\n\n146\n00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.550\nNetInstall which is\nthe clean installation.\n\n147\n00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.240\nI mentioned NetRestore which is\nthe customized installation.\n\n148\n00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.830\nAnd there is a third one called Netboot,\nand\n\n149\n00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.570\nNetboot is the weirdest one\nout of all three of them.\n\n150\n00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.930\nWith the first two we're\nactually installing El Capitan\n\n151\n00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.090\non the destination machine, on the target.\n\n152\n00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.620\nSo, if I have a new Mac and I boot it\nup and I install a net installer, a net\n\n153\n00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.930\nrestorage of it, it's actually installing\nthe operating system on that machine.\n\n154\n00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.620\nAnd after it's on there, that's it.\n\n155\n00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.780\nIt's done.\nNow it can just run.\n\n156\n00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.450\nIt's an independent entity and\nthat's the end of it.\n\n157\n00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:45.190\nBut there is a third form called\nNetBoot and NetBoot is different.\n\n158\n00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:49.870\nWith NetBoot you don't install\nthe operating system on your hard drive.\n\n159\n00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.557\nIn fact what happens is your Mac boots.\n\n160\n00:07:51.557 --> 00:07:54.150\nIt look for a NetInstall server.\n\n161\n00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.671\nIt finds the NetBoot image.\n\n162\n00:07:56.671 --> 00:07:59.895\nAnd when it finds that NetBoot image,\n\n163\n00:07:59.895 --> 00:08:04.340\nnow it can take that net boot image and\nboot off of it.\n\n164\n00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.010\nWhere it actually loads it into RAM.\n\n165\n00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.190\nIt's not installing it on the hard drive,\nit's loading into RAM.\n\n166\n00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.030\nYou don't even have to have\na hard drive in your computer.\n\n167\n00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:15.790\nAlbeit every Mac has a hard drive but\ntechnically you could take it out.\n\n168\n00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:20.420\nAnd NetBoot will run from RAM,\nrunning that entire operating system.\n\n169\n00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.440\nIf it has a hard drive it will start\nto cache files onto the hard drive for\n\n170\n00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.130\nthat session, but\nas soon as the session is over,\n\n171\n00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.890\nwhen you shut that Mac down,\nall that stuff goes away, it's gone.\n\n172\n00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.010\nAnd the next time you power it on it's\ngonna boot off the network again,\n\n173\n00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.550\nit'll grab that image from the server and\nboot right off of it.\n\n174\n00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:40.090\nSo every time you turn that Mac on,\nit's fresh and clean and\n\n175\n00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.370\nback to the way it was.\n\n176\n00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.560\nNow, on a positive side that means I can\nhave something like a computer lab and\n\n177\n00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.460\nI would know that every day when I\nturn that computer on it was gonna\n\n178\n00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.650\nbe fresh and clean.\n\n179\n00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.950\nThat's good.\n\n180\n00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.370\nOn the negative side,\nit slows things down a good bit.\n\n181\n00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.460\nYour boot time takes a lot longer,\n\n182\n00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.550\ncuz you're having to copy that image\nover the network every time you boot.\n\n183\n00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.800\nAnd so it's not great if you're\nworried about performance and\n\n184\n00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.010\ngetting these done quickly cuz your\nreboots take a heck of a lot longer.\n\n185\n00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.450\nBut it is an option that's out there.\n\n186\n00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:14.780\nWhen you do NetBoot,\nyour clients become effectively,\n\n187\n00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.870\nyou almost want to call them thin clients.\n\n188\n00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.320\nNot really thin clients because they\nare still doing the processing,\n\n189\n00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.640\nyou are using their RAM.\n\n190\n00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.500\nBut they really become like terminals,\nwhere you don't store data on your client\n\n191\n00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.570\nanymore because it's gonna be\ngone the next time you reboot.\n\n192\n00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.180\nEverything's done via the network,\nso that's NetBoot.\n\n193\n00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.610\nAnd NetBoot is probably the least\nused of the three models.\n\n194\n00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:37.420\n>> When you say, Don, the whole terminal,\ndoes this mean that in theory,\n\n195\n00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.130\nlike a terminal session more than one\nperson can connect to a single image?\n\n196\n00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.350\n>> Yeah, absolutely because you are not\nactually running from the image on\n\n197\n00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.270\nthe server, you're copying\nthe image down for yourself.\n\n198\n00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:50.640\nSo if there's a thousand machines,\nthey copy it a thousand times.\n\n199\n00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.520\nThey copy it down to themselves and\nthey run on it.\n\n200\n00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.430\nThen when you shut that machine down it\nwipes that out, you boot it back up, and\n\n201\n00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:56.350\nthey download it again.\n\n202\n00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.940\nThey download it over and over again.\n\n203\n00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:04.396\nThe neat part about this is, let's say\nthat we're running 10.11 El Capitan.\n\n204\n00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:08.500\nAnd then 10.12 comes out,\nwhich doesn't exist right now.\n\n205\n00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:13.850\nSo let's call it, I don't know,\nwhat's a park that hasn't been used.\n\n206\n00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.720\n>> I don't know, there's a bunch\nof them that they're using.\n\n207\n00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.090\n>> Yeah, well let's say that,\nwhat was the one in Yogi Bear?\n\n208\n00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:19.940\nJellystone.\n\n209\n00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.350\nSo we have OS 10.12 Jellystone comes out.\n\n210\n00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.120\nAnd we wanna roll that out on the network.\n\n211\n00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.410\nWell, if you're doing NetBoot,\n\n212\n00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.010\nall you have to do is swap out\nthe image on your net install server.\n\n213\n00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.950\nGo to the net install server,\ntake the NetBoot image for El Capitan and\n\n214\n00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.030\nswap it out with Jellystone.\n\n215\n00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.980\nAnd now the next time\nall your machines boot,\n\n216\n00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.330\nthey're running Jellystone just like that,\nright?\n\n217\n00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.440\nThey're upgraded, so it make essentially\nmanaging your workstation super easy.\n\n218\n00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.640\nThat's kind of the trade off.\n\n219\n00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.320\nAs you get this kinda\ngreat feature set but\n\n220\n00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.290\nit's slower because of having\na boot off of the network, right?\n\n221\n00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:55.890\nWith NetInstall and NetRestore,\nyou do the deployment.\n\n222\n00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.460\nYou deploy it and\nnow those machines run independently.\n\n223\n00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.280\nThey are their own free standing machine,\nand\n\n224\n00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.910\nso if I wanna upgrade them I'd have to\ngo to that machine to do the upgrade.\n\n225\n00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:08.180\nOr I could create a new NetInstall\nimage and do a redeployment that way.\n\n226\n00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.730\nYou could make it work that way.\n\n227\n00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.920\nBut it's really designed just for\nthe initial deployment.\n\n228\n00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.250\nSo NetInstall and NetRestore are for\nthe initial deployment.\n\n229\n00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.750\nNetBoot is for ongoing.\n\n230\n00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.200\nNow I said NetBoot was the least used.\n\n231\n00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.110\nSo if you wanna do ongoing\nupdates to a machine,\n\n232\n00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.510\nwhat do we do if it's not NetBoot?\n\n233\n00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:30.080\nWell, it's usually easier to use\nsomething like Apple Remote Desktop.\n\n234\n00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.060\nApple Remote Desktop can\npush out application,\n\n235\n00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.950\nit can push out software updates,\nit can push out command line parameters,\n\n236\n00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.100\nyou can push settings easily to\nmachines that are already deployed.\n\n237\n00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.250\nAnd even better, it can do it if\nthe operating systems don't match.\n\n238\n00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.733\nYou might have some that\nare 10.10 Yosemite or\n\n239\n00:11:43.733 --> 00:11:45.990\n10.11 El Capitan or\n10.12 Jellystone [LAUGH].\n\n240\n00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:50.280\nIt'd be amazing if they\nactually called it that,\n\n241\n00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.740\nbut anyhow, you could have whatever it\nis and they're gonna get that image,\n\n242\n00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.710\nthey're going to get that\nsofter application made.\n\n243\n00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:57.760\nIt's a great utility.\n\n244\n00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.670\nIf you haven't used Apple Remote Desktop,\ncheck it out,\n\n245\n00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:03.020\nit's I want to say it's like $80\nin the app store or something.\n\n246\n00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.890\nIt's not terribly expensive but it does\ncost more than a server app which I think\n\n247\n00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:11.310\nis kinda funny cuz a server app does a lot\nmore, but it is a useful utility to have.\n\n248\n00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.180\n>> With memory resonant and\noperating system like NetBoot Don,\n\n249\n00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:18.100\nwhat happens, first thing I would\nthink of is if we do wanna use that,\n\n250\n00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.590\nwhat happens to storage as far\nas user settings, user's files.\n\n251\n00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.450\nHow would you set that up if\neverything's gonna be discarded when\n\n252\n00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:25.740\nwe reboot the machine.\n\n253\n00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.350\n>> So on NetBoot, ideally,\nyou'll have an open directory.\n\n254\n00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.920\nAnd with an open directory,\nyou can set it so\n\n255\n00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.090\nthat every user account has\na home directory, right?\n\n256\n00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.740\nAnd that home directory can be\na share point on your server.\n\n257\n00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.180\nSo that they can easily save that.\n\n258\n00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.420\nBut you've gotta educate your users,\nhey, don't save things locally,\n\n259\n00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.500\ncuz it's gonna go away.\n\n260\n00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.870\nMake sure you save to\nthis network drive and\n\n261\n00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.280\nthis network location,\nit's all about user education.\n\n262\n00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:47.930\nAll right, well, Wes,\n\n263\n00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.760\nwe are creeping into this episode and\nI haven't shown a darn thing yet,\n\n264\n00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.680\nso let's jump in and actually take\na look at how some of this stuff works.\n\n265\n00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.330\nNow, I'm gonna kick things off\nhere in the server app and\n\n266\n00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.480\nin a lot of these episodes\nI use virtual machines, but\n\n267\n00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.280\nbecause we're going to be pushing a lot of\ndata over the network, I'm using my actual\n\n268\n00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.550\nlaptop this time, because I wanna make\nsure I get the best performance possible.\n\n269\n00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:10.100\nAnd so this is my laptop,\nwhere I'm running El Capitan,\n\n270\n00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.860\nI think I'm running 10.11.4,\nlet's see if I'm updated, and yes.\n\n271\n00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.100\nSo I'm running 10.11.4,\n\n272\n00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.570\nthe latest version of El Capitan\nas of the filming of this episode.\n\n273\n00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.100\nAnd I've got the server app installed, but\n\n274\n00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.720\nI haven't actually\nconfigured the server app.\n\n275\n00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.070\nSo if you look at all my\nservices over here, and\n\n276\n00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.900\nthat there's no green dots on any of them.\n\n277\n00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.290\nI'm not running of the services,\nall right.\n\n278\n00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:34.870\nNow if we go down here to advanced,\nyou can find NetInstall.\n\n279\n00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:39.750\nAnd the service is called NetInstall but\nit's powering NetBoot and NetRestore also.\n\n280\n00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.970\nAll three of them powered from the same\nplace right here inside of NetInstall.\n\n281\n00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:48.220\nAnd when I go to connect to that, there's\nnot a whole lot of options here for\n\n282\n00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.300\nme to tweak.\n\n283\n00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.610\nThat's because the NetInstall server\nworks using the Bonjour protocol.\n\n284\n00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.030\nMachines find each other's\nautomatic discovery, so\n\n285\n00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.130\nmost of this stuff is pretty simple.\n\n286\n00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:03.190\nThe key things I need here are,\nI need images to deploy, and\n\n287\n00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.970\nI need to tell the server app\nwhere those images are stored.\n\n288\n00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.580\nIt's gotta be able to find them.\n\n289\n00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.920\nSo, see how I've got storage locations and\nit's got edit storage locations.\n\n290\n00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.760\nNow a lot of times, we'll see where\nthese services default to using our\n\n291\n00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.065\nMacintosh HD but this time, it didn't.\n\n292\n00:14:19.065 --> 00:14:20.125\nWhy not?\n\n293\n00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:23.235\nWell, Apple knows that these\ninstallation images are gonna be big and\n\n294\n00:14:23.235 --> 00:14:26.195\nthey know that most people are not\ngoing to have them on the Macintosh HD.\n\n295\n00:14:26.195 --> 00:14:28.965\nSo, on this one, we actually have\nto choose before we get started.\n\n296\n00:14:28.965 --> 00:14:31.345\nA little bit different than all\nthe other services that we've seen.\n\n297\n00:14:31.345 --> 00:14:32.475\nHere we just have to pick.\n\n298\n00:14:32.475 --> 00:14:34.335\nSo, I'm gonna pick where\nthese are gonna be stored.\n\n299\n00:14:34.335 --> 00:14:39.040\nNow, my laptop has an SSD which is not\nvery large, so I don't wanna use my SSD\n\n300\n00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.690\nfor storage, I have an external\nhard drive here that I'm gonna use.\n\n301\n00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:47.390\nNow anytime you use an external hard\ndrive with an OS 10 server app,\n\n302\n00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:50.720\nyou need to make sure that you\nturn on ownership on the drive.\n\n303\n00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.280\nRemovable drives ignore ownership,\n\n304\n00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.260\nin other words the file\npermissions don't work.\n\n305\n00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.030\nFor this system to work ideally,\nyou'll want a removable drive or\n\n306\n00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.170\nsome kind of extra hard drive that\n\n307\n00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:04.410\nhas ownership enabled is\nformatted OS X extended journaled.\n\n308\n00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:07.350\nIt actually doesn't have to be\nformatted OS X extended journaled but\n\n309\n00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.510\nyou will find that it\nworks better if it is.\n\n310\n00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:13.070\nSo, in my case, it is formatted that way\nbut I don't have that ownership set.\n\n311\n00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:16.150\nSo I am just gonna pull up\nthe properties on that disk.\n\n312\n00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.640\nAnd scroll down here to the bottom and,\nactually I'm wrong.\n\n313\n00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.540\nSo, see this ignore ownership on\nthis volume, and it's not checked.\n\n314\n00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.840\nSo in my case it is actually\nturned off already.\n\n315\n00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.630\nIf that was turned on, I would just need\nto uncheck it, so I'm actually good to go.\n\n316\n00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.300\nIt's curious, I don't remember setting\nthat, so apparently I did it earlier.\n\n317\n00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.990\nAll right, so now I just need\nto tell the system to use it.\n\n318\n00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:38.690\nNow that hard drive, if I open it up,\nit's completely blank.\n\n319\n00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:42.200\nAnd when I tell NetInstall to use that\ndrive for storage, it's actually gonna\n\n320\n00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.570\ncreate a little folder structure\non that disk to store the images.\n\n321\n00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:49.041\nAnd the folder structure is very specific,\nso don't create your own.\n\n322\n00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:51.792\nIt's expecting a certain set\nof file names to be in place.\n\n323\n00:15:51.792 --> 00:15:56.434\nSo I'm gonna edit my storage locations and\nI'll see the drives that I can pick and\n\n324\n00:15:56.434 --> 00:15:58.800\nI've got this storage drive.\n\n325\n00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.700\nAnd notice over here I've got stored\ndata there's actually two different\n\n326\n00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:02.560\ntypes of data.\n\n327\n00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:07.370\nIf I drop that down see how\nI've got images client data,\n\n328\n00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.246\nimages and client okay.\n\n329\n00:16:09.246 --> 00:16:13.370\nWell the images, those are what we use for\nNetInstall, NetRestore and NetBoot.\n\n330\n00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.750\nI've got to have some\nplace to put my images.\n\n331\n00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.610\nWhat's the client data?\n\n332\n00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:21.600\nWell, with NetRestore, you could\nbuild NetRestore images of people's\n\n333\n00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.870\nindividual machines, and so\nthey contain client data.\n\n334\n00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.880\nBut with NetBoot, you can choose to\n\n335\n00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:33.100\nhave their settings cached onto the server\nInstead of being cached locally.\n\n336\n00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.350\nNormally they cache locally and\n\n337\n00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:36.970\nthey get wiped out any time when\nwe reset that machine, right?\n\n338\n00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:41.090\nBut if we can cache them on the server,\nnow they can NetBoot and they'll maintain\n\n339\n00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:46.200\ntheir settings and so we can start to\ncreate a more typical use case scenario.\n\n340\n00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.100\nMy typical approach though\nis not to do that, right?\n\n341\n00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.130\nBecause if I'm gonna go through the\ntrouble of doing NetBoot I probably want\n\n342\n00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:53.910\nthat machine to be fresh and\nclean every time so\n\n343\n00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.700\nI don't wanna preserve those settings.\n\n344\n00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:00.200\nIf I wanna preserve settings I'll put\na hard drive in the machine, right, but\n\n345\n00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.800\nI have a hard drives in the machines and\nclients are saving\n\n346\n00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.610\ntheir data locally now I gotta a bunch\nof machine I gonna manage backups for.\n\n347\n00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:12.040\nIf I put all the client data on my server,\nnow, I've got one place to go and back up.\n\n348\n00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.250\nI can back up that location,\n\n349\n00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:16.950\nand I would know that I've backed up all\nof my client's data that's out there.\n\n350\n00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.240\nSo, that's why we have\nthese different options.\n\n351\n00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.720\nI'm just gonna choose Images and Client\nData, to put them both on that drive.\n\n352\n00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.740\nBut you can split them up if you want.\n\n353\n00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:28.740\nAll right, and then notice here\nthat it's telling me, images,\n\n354\n00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:33.410\nshould go in /Library/NetBoot/NetBootSP0.\n\n355\n00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:37.522\nAnd the client data will go in\n/Library/NetBoot/NetbootClients0,\n\n356\n00:17:37.522 --> 00:17:38.520\nall right.\n\n357\n00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.200\nSo, what is this?\n\n358\n00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.960\nSo, NetBootSP,\nthat's the Netboot SharePoint.\n\n359\n00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.220\nThat's the shared folder that\nis going to contain the images.\n\n360\n00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.606\nAnd then 0, this is the first one.\n\n361\n00:17:47.606 --> 00:17:51.866\nI might have more than one, in which case\nI would have NetBootSp1, NetBootSp2,\n\n362\n00:17:51.866 --> 00:17:54.140\nand so on, but this is the first one.\n\n363\n00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.280\nSame thing with clients, right?\n\n364\n00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.460\nNetBootClients, and then 0, and then as\nwe create more, they would have 1 and\n\n365\n00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.010\n2 and so on, right?\n\n366\n00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.080\nNow I don't really have to\npay attention to this path.\n\n367\n00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.470\nI do if I wanna get\nthe question right on the exam.\n\n368\n00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.380\nCuz it turns up on the exam, what path\ndo you expect the images to be in?\n\n369\n00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.040\nBut in real life,\nyou just hit OK here, and\n\n370\n00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.950\nit makes that folder storage for\nyou, right?\n\n371\n00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:18.606\nSo I've got my storage drive selected and\nif I browse into it, it made,\n\n372\n00:18:18.606 --> 00:18:23.064\nLibrary/Netboot/NetbookClient0 and\n\n373\n00:18:23.064 --> 00:18:27.902\nNetbootSP0, it made that structure for\nme so I don't have to worry about it, but\n\n374\n00:18:27.902 --> 00:18:33.485\nwhen I make my images, I need to make sure\nthat I put them in this folder right here.\n\n375\n00:18:33.485 --> 00:18:36.105\nI can't just throw them in a folder\ncalled images, or something like that.\n\n376\n00:18:36.105 --> 00:18:39.365\nIt's gotta go in this folder right here.\n\n377\n00:18:39.365 --> 00:18:41.210\nClient data,\nI don't put anything in there.\n\n378\n00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:45.080\nIf I turn on the client data option later,\nthen it will start to save there\n\n379\n00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.990\nautomatically, it will\npopulate that on its own.\n\n380\n00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:50.970\nOkay, so, I've got my storage set.\n\n381\n00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:56.720\nAnd if I go back to the server app, I can\npick which adapters that I want to run on.\n\n382\n00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.120\nNow, I'm on a laptop.\n\n383\n00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:03.350\nMy laptop has a wifi built into it and,\nI've got a Thunderbolt ethernet adapter.\n\n384\n00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:06.730\nNow, which one do you think you're\ngonna get better performance out of?\n\n385\n00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:07.810\nThe Thunderbolt adapter.\n\n386\n00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.960\nAnd Apple knows that and that's why its\nchosen here, kind of like, by default.\n\n387\n00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.520\nBut you can go in to Choose Ports and\n\n388\n00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.360\nyou can pick what adapters\nthat you want to use.\n\n389\n00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.610\nAnd, my Wi-Fi is not even showing up.\n\n390\n00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:21.030\nWhy is Wi-Fi not showing up?\n\n391\n00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:24.710\nWell, Wi-Fi doesn't necessarily\nplay nice with things like\n\n392\n00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.160\nBonjour auto discovery at boot time and\nso on.\n\n393\n00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.665\nAnd so\nit's not even showing up here in my list.\n\n394\n00:19:29.665 --> 00:19:30.950\nWi-Fi is turned on.\n\n395\n00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:34.070\nI can see up here I'm actually\nconnected to the ITPT network, but\n\n396\n00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.340\nApple knows that if you're\nsetting up a Netboot server,\n\n397\n00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.940\nyou'll want it to be under a Thunderbolt\nadapter or a physical adapter.\n\n398\n00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.710\nIf you're setting up a Mac miniserver it's\ngot a physical ethernet jack on it, and\n\n399\n00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:44.610\nit'll show up right there.\n\n400\n00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:46.240\nSo I'm just gonna pick that one.\n\n401\n00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.330\nYou might have more than one adapter,\nand you might want to turn this on for\n\n402\n00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:49.950\nmore than one.\n\n403\n00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.710\nIf you've got four adapters you could\nincrease your bandwidth by having it on on\n\n404\n00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:53.630\nall four.\n\n405\n00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.320\nBut in my case I've just got the one so,\nI'm okay with that.\n\n406\n00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.560\nAll right,\nthen we've got Restrict Access to Images.\n\n407\n00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.900\nNow normally,\nwe're not worried about that.\n\n408\n00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.170\nIf I have an El Capitan image\nstored on my server, and\n\n409\n00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:07.530\nsomebody connects to it, what do they get?\n\n410\n00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.650\nThey just get El Capitan.\n\n411\n00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.580\nIf I have a Net Restore image that's built\nup, that has all my work applications,\n\n412\n00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.920\nwell all the work computers already\nhave that, so what do I care?\n\n413\n00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.630\nBut NetRestore can actually be used to\nback up individual people's machines.\n\n414\n00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:25.670\nSo, for example, I could back up Wes's\nlaptop, making a NetRestore image.\n\n415\n00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.520\nAnd when I do that, if Wes ever had\na problem with his laptop I could redeploy\n\n416\n00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.940\nit and he would have all his settings and\n\n417\n00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.820\nall his stuff, including all of\nhis personal documents on there.\n\n418\n00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:37.120\nAnd that is something I wouldnt\nwant everyone to get to.\n\n419\n00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.490\nSo, I can restrict access to\nthe images and you can come in and\n\n420\n00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:44.200\nspecify what MAC Addresses\nare allowed to get to those images.\n\n421\n00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.420\nNow this is a global filter right here.\n\n422\n00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.300\nWe can tweak this on our\nindividual images if we want\n\n423\n00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.360\nas well as tweak it in other areas.\n\n424\n00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.270\nSo if you wanna restrict the access,\nI can come in and say let me put in\n\n425\n00:20:56.270 --> 00:21:00.560\nthe MAC address for Wes's laptop\nspecifically and that one's approved.\n\n426\n00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.560\nAnd now if somebody comes into\nthe building with their own computer and\n\n427\n00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.780\nthey're like let me see if\nI can NetRestore something,\n\n428\n00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.780\nthey're not in this list.\n\n429\n00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:08.260\nThey won't be able to\ntalk to the server so\n\n430\n00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.290\nwe can provide a little\nadditional security.\n\n431\n00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:14.240\nIt's not the greatest security in the\nworld because MAC addresses are kinda easy\n\n432\n00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.356\nto spoof, but it will take a little more\nwork than somebody just booting up and\n\n433\n00:21:18.356 --> 00:21:19.153\ndoing a NetRestore.\n\n434\n00:21:21.952 --> 00:21:22.930\nAll right,\n\n435\n00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:28.160\nso once that's done, the only other thing\nI have got on this screen are images.\n\n436\n00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.320\nAnd right now you'll see I've\ngot no images available.\n\n437\n00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.530\nI don't have any images on my hard drive\nso the server can't really do any work.\n\n438\n00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.620\nBut it's configured,\nit's set up the way that I want it.\n\n439\n00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.190\nI just need to turn it on.\n\n440\n00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.070\nAnd so when I turn it on, my machine is\nnow going to start advertising itself on\n\n441\n00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:48.000\nthe network saying hey I am a NetBoot\nserver, or a NetInstall server,\n\n442\n00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.970\nand well I could if I\nhad at least one image.\n\n443\n00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.500\nI don't want to advertise myself if I\ndon't have even have a single image to\n\n444\n00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.000\nhand out, and so it's stopping me.\n\n445\n00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.240\nThe only other thing here in\nthe server app is the connections tab.\n\n446\n00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.110\nAnd if I go to the connections tab,\n\n447\n00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.930\nI can see no clients connected\nbecause I'm not actually running.\n\n448\n00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:08.950\nSo if I want to get running I'm\ngonna need to create an image.\n\n449\n00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.340\nSo let's create one.\n\n450\n00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.500\nLet's start simple.\n\n451\n00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.380\nLet's just create a straight\nup El Capitan install image.\n\n452\n00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.520\nMaybe I've got a bunch of machines here\nthat are still running Yosemite or\n\n453\n00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.480\nMavericks, Mountain Lion, whatever.\n\n454\n00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.280\nAnd I wanted to deploy El Capitan to them\nbut I don't want to do it from Apple\n\n455\n00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.970\nservers because it takes too long and\nI don't want to do a bootable key.\n\n456\n00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:28.740\nSo I just want to make an image\nright here that I can use for that.\n\n457\n00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.420\nWell, you've actually got most\nof what you need right here.\n\n458\n00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.300\nFirst I need the installation file for\nEl Capitan.\n\n459\n00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.140\nSo if you've got a machine\nthat you've already upgraded,\n\n460\n00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:40.850\nyou can go into your applications\nfolder and in your applications folder,\n\n461\n00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:47.030\nyou shouldn have an application\ncalled install OS 10 El Capitan.\n\n462\n00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.210\nThis guy right here.\n\n463\n00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:53.130\nIf you don't have that file, you can just\ngo into the App Store and search for\n\n464\n00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:54.460\nEl Capitan.\n\n465\n00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:58.100\nSo if I go into the App Store,\nwe can search for\n\n466\n00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:03.350\nEl Capitan, and it'll turn up right here.\n\n467\n00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.860\nAnd if you've already got it installed,\nyou'll see a download button.\n\n468\n00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:06.530\nYou can hit download.\n\n469\n00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:08.800\nIt'll download it and\nsave it to your applications folder.\n\n470\n00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.030\nBut you need that file, right?\n\n471\n00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:11.700\nIt doesn't matter which\ncomputer you download it from.\n\n472\n00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.070\nThe file's always the same.\n\n473\n00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:16.570\nSo we just need that file\ndownloaded from somebody.\n\n474\n00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.880\nAnd then once we've got that file,\n\n475\n00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.740\nwe can run into what's called\nthe system image utility.\n\n476\n00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.470\nThe system image utility is kinda\none of those that's buried away.\n\n477\n00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.240\nIt used to be here under Utilities and\nApple,\n\n478\n00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.970\na couple of versions ago, they decided\nto take some of these utilities out and\n\n479\n00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:34.850\nmove them into what's called\nthe CoreServices folder.\n\n480\n00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.958\nIt's buried away inside of /System.\n\n481\n00:23:36.958 --> 00:23:40.858\nSo now, it's not like we can just\nbrowse here and find it, but\n\n482\n00:23:40.858 --> 00:23:43.110\nit is buried away on the hard drive.\n\n483\n00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:45.373\nIf you use your Spotlight,\nthat's the easiest way to get to it.\n\n484\n00:23:45.373 --> 00:23:50.700\nSo I'm gonna use my spotlight and\nI'm just gonna type system image utility.\n\n485\n00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.760\nThere it is, system image utility.\n\n486\n00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:59.720\nAnd if I launch that, this is the utility\nwe can use to build installation images or\n\n487\n00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.390\nnet boot or net restore or\nwhatever it is that we wanna do.\n\n488\n00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:06.000\nWe can build those images right here.\n\n489\n00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.509\nNow, the first thing it's gonna ask me for\nis a source.\n\n490\n00:24:09.509 --> 00:24:12.020\nWhat am I going to use as the source for\nthe boot up?\n\n491\n00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:17.460\nWell, if you have that El Capitan image in\nyour application folder, it'll find it.\n\n492\n00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:21.400\nWe got a few other options, I'll talk\nabout these in the later episodes.\n\n493\n00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.990\nBut this is the one that I want, I want\nto build an installation for El Capitan.\n\n494\n00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:31.240\nNow well actually,\nlooking at it, this is 10.11.3.\n\n495\n00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.446\nI know 10.11.4 is the latest.\n\n496\n00:24:33.446 --> 00:24:37.022\nIf I deploy this, those machines\nare gonna have to update to 10.11.4.\n\n497\n00:24:37.022 --> 00:24:40.099\nSo I should probably delete this file and\nredownload it so\n\n498\n00:24:40.099 --> 00:24:44.210\nI download the 10.11.4 version,\nand now I'll be good to go.\n\n499\n00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.630\nBut we definitely don't have time for\nthat in this episode, so\n\n500\n00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.580\nI'm just going to stick with 10.11.3.\n\n501\n00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:52.342\nJust know in real life land you can save\nyourself a lot of effort on the client\n\n502\n00:24:52.342 --> 00:24:55.868\nside if you always download the latest\nversion of the operating system\n\n503\n00:24:55.868 --> 00:24:56.961\nyou're deploying.\n\n504\n00:24:56.961 --> 00:24:59.144\nSo I'm gonna choose that and\nI'll I'll hit Next.\n\n505\n00:24:59.144 --> 00:25:03.304\nAnd now it's gonna ask me what I wanna\nmake, and here's the three options,\n\n506\n00:25:03.304 --> 00:25:06.025\nNetBoot, NetInstall, NetRestore.\n\n507\n00:25:06.025 --> 00:25:10.235\nSo it's the same utility to make these\nimages, but they're three different types.\n\n508\n00:25:10.235 --> 00:25:15.021\nAnd again, we'll see those in the next few\nepisodes, but I want to make NetInstall.\n\n509\n00:25:15.021 --> 00:25:18.414\nI'm gonna Install OS X over\nthe network from a hosted disk image,\n\n510\n00:25:18.414 --> 00:25:20.165\nthat's exactly what I wanna do.\n\n511\n00:25:20.165 --> 00:25:21.837\nNice and simple.\n\n512\n00:25:21.837 --> 00:25:23.835\nSo I'll go and hit Next on that.\n\n513\n00:25:23.835 --> 00:25:25.567\nI have to sign a license agreement,\n\n514\n00:25:25.567 --> 00:25:29.222\ncuz normally you have to agree to\na license agreement when you install OS X.\n\n515\n00:25:29.222 --> 00:25:31.913\nHere, we're gonna be deploying\nit on people's behalf, so\n\n516\n00:25:31.913 --> 00:25:33.719\nwe have to agree to this on their behalf.\n\n517\n00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.350\nNext, we've got\nAdd Configuration Profiles,\n\n518\n00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.100\nPackages and Post-Install Scripts.\n\n519\n00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.800\nThis is really powerful.\n\n520\n00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:47.470\nYou might have a profile manager, and if\nyou have a profile manager at a minimum,\n\n521\n00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:50.480\nyou've got that little certificate\nprofile you wanna hand out, so\n\n522\n00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.390\npeople will trust you, the trust profile.\n\n523\n00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:54.080\nI can add that right here, so\n\n524\n00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:59.500\nwhen I deploy El Capitan, it's already\ngoing to trust my profile manager.\n\n525\n00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:03.528\nThen when it boots up the profile manager\ncan push all the other settings onto it to\n\n526\n00:26:03.528 --> 00:26:04.307\nconfigure it.\n\n527\n00:26:04.307 --> 00:26:07.006\nAdding things like user accounts, getting\nus set up for Apple remote desktop,\n\n528\n00:26:07.006 --> 00:26:08.320\nall that stuff.\n\n529\n00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.570\nWe can do packages, if I have software\nthat I want to be installed automatically,\n\n530\n00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.785\nI can put that in here and\nit'll be installed or drivers.\n\n531\n00:26:14.785 --> 00:26:18.380\nPost-install scripts,\nI can put Python scripts in here and\n\n532\n00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:21.600\nwhen it finishes the install or\nusually you do like a Bash scripts,\n\n533\n00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.990\nit can run the scripts and\ndo all sorts of crazy things.\n\n534\n00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.850\nSo there's a lot that\nwe can customize here.\n\n535\n00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.570\nYou can even do Automator scripts.\n\n536\n00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:30.260\nSo anything you can do in Automator,\nyou can throw in right here.\n\n537\n00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:33.590\nIn fact, if I hit this Customize\nbutton down here at the bottom,\n\n538\n00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:37.530\nit'll take me to the Automator,\nat least I think it will, there we go.\n\n539\n00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:41.040\nAnd once you're in the Automator, now\nyou can do all the Automator stuff, and\n\n540\n00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.510\nit'll be stored in the image.\n\n541\n00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:46.250\nSee over here, we've got Define Image\nSource, El Capitan, and then I can\n\n542\n00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:51.510\nadd right after any Automator steps I want\nto do whatever action it is that I need.\n\n543\n00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:55.290\nSo you can customize\nthis image quite a bit\n\n544\n00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:57.360\neven though it's just\nthat base install image.\n\n545\n00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.520\n>> And from the user experience Don, would\nthat make that almost a zero touch, or\n\n546\n00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.511\nyeah, I guess it would be like a zero\ntouch type installation, not quite?\n\n547\n00:27:05.511 --> 00:27:06.533\n>> They call it a light touch.\n\n548\n00:27:06.533 --> 00:27:07.740\n>> Light touch, that's it.\n\n549\n00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.249\n>> An LTI, a light touch installation.\n\n550\n00:27:09.249 --> 00:27:14.640\nIn the deployment world, ZTI is that\nholy grail, the zero touch install.\n\n551\n00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.420\nIn other words,\nsomebody's gotta push the power button but\n\n552\n00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.100\nthen after that,\nit just installs then it's done.\n\n553\n00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.730\nThat's not what we're gonna have here,\nwe're gonna have light touch.\n\n554\n00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:27.900\nSomebody has to boot and tell it to get\nthat NetInstall image and install it.\n\n555\n00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.620\nSo you do have to do a little bit,\nbut it's very brief so\n\n556\n00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.710\nthey call it light touch.\n\n557\n00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:35.057\nSo it's a simple touch and\nthen it installs the operating system,\n\n558\n00:27:35.057 --> 00:27:38.609\nit installs the applications,\neverything else is fully automated.\n\n559\n00:27:38.609 --> 00:27:41.500\nI'm gonna hit Next on that,\nand once that's done,\n\n560\n00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.730\nnow it's gonna ask me,\nwell a few little questions here.\n\n561\n00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.480\nSo this one is saying,\nwhat I wanna do for the computer name?\n\n562\n00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.520\nEvery computer has to have a name.\n\n563\n00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.030\nNormally, when you run through the install\nwizard, you type in your name, and so\n\n564\n00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:56.480\nif I type in Dan Pezet, then it might\nbe called Don Pezet's Macbook Pro, or\n\n565\n00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.490\nDon Pezet's Mac Mini or whatever.\n\n566\n00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:00.490\nSo how does it name these?\n\n567\n00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:05.110\nWe can punch in either a unique\nidentifier type name or we can provide it\n\n568\n00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:08.600\nwith a file that contains all\nthe different computer names that we want.\n\n569\n00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:13.800\nI'm just gonna leave it empty, and\nwe'll let it figure it out for us.\n\n570\n00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.460\nThen, if I wanna bind it to\nan open directory, I can.\n\n571\n00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.930\nThe default install is just\ngonna be stand alone, so\n\n572\n00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:21.961\nI can bind it to an open\ndirectory if I want.\n\n573\n00:28:21.961 --> 00:28:26.500\nI'll leave that empty, and\nwhat drive I want to install.\n\n574\n00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.180\nNow this is an important screen,\n\n575\n00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.690\nbecause what it's asking me is what\ndrive do I want to install to?\n\n576\n00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:32.200\nBut what it's really asking,\n\n577\n00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:36.850\nwhat it's secretly asking is do I wanna\ndo a clean install or an upgrade?\n\n578\n00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:40.087\nIf I'm installing to a machine\nthat has Yosemite on it, and\n\n579\n00:28:40.087 --> 00:28:42.242\nI leave it set to these default values.\n\n580\n00:28:42.242 --> 00:28:45.235\nIt's gonna ask the user what drive they\nwant to install on and if they pick\n\n581\n00:28:45.235 --> 00:28:48.395\nthe Yosemite one, it's gonna upgrade\nthem and all of their data will stay.\n\n582\n00:28:48.395 --> 00:28:51.187\nIf I want it to be a fresh and\nclean install,\n\n583\n00:28:51.187 --> 00:28:56.011\nI need to tell it Automatically install\nto, and I need to give it the name.\n\n584\n00:28:56.011 --> 00:28:58.402\nAnd the drive is normally\ncalled Macintosh HD.\n\n585\n00:28:58.402 --> 00:29:02.977\nAnd then erase the target volume\nbefore installing, I need it to erase.\n\n586\n00:29:02.977 --> 00:29:06.731\nThis option is one of the most important\nones, because if I leave it blank,\n\n587\n00:29:06.731 --> 00:29:08.411\nit's not an automated install.\n\n588\n00:29:08.411 --> 00:29:10.454\nThis is a great exam question.\n\n589\n00:29:10.454 --> 00:29:12.079\nIt's not an automated install,\n\n590\n00:29:12.079 --> 00:29:14.871\nthey will be asked to pick\nan installation destination.\n\n591\n00:29:14.871 --> 00:29:20.468\nBut if you provide the name,\nnow it is an automated install.\n\n592\n00:29:20.468 --> 00:29:22.696\nNow, what if somebody\nrenamed that hard drive?\n\n593\n00:29:22.696 --> 00:29:25.070\nWhat if it's not called Macintosh HD?\n\n594\n00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:27.243\nWell, we can go back a few pages\nto the customize screen or\n\n595\n00:29:27.243 --> 00:29:29.790\nactually I still have my\ncustomize button right there.\n\n596\n00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:33.720\nGo into the Automator, and\nadd steps to format the hard drive and\n\n597\n00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.440\nname it Macintosh HD.\n\n598\n00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.170\nNow you know it'll have\nthat no matter what, and\n\n599\n00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.490\nnow you can do your installments\nfully automated again.\n\n600\n00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:46.070\nBut this page right here,\nis what truly determines whether it's\n\n601\n00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:50.450\nan automated install or not, and whether\nit's a clean install or an upgrade.\n\n602\n00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:52.110\nThat's really what's\nbeing decided right here.\n\n603\n00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:55.524\nSo kind of an important important page.\n\n604\n00:29:55.524 --> 00:29:56.824\nAfter that, we get a name for it.\n\n605\n00:29:56.824 --> 00:30:00.995\nThis one's just called a NetInstall\nof Install OS X El Capitan.\n\n606\n00:30:00.995 --> 00:30:02.315\nI'm gonna rename that a little bit.\n\n607\n00:30:02.315 --> 00:30:05.420\nI'll say,\nNetInstall of OS X El Capitan, and\n\n608\n00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:11.248\nthen it's got a description that shows\nthat it's 10.11.3 and an image index.\n\n609\n00:30:11.248 --> 00:30:12.977\nNow what's an image index?\n\n610\n00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:15.837\nThere's two different\nthings that I can set here.\n\n611\n00:30:15.837 --> 00:30:19.731\nI can assign a random image index where\nit just picks a number out hat or\n\n612\n00:30:19.731 --> 00:30:21.488\nI can assign it a specific one.\n\n613\n00:30:21.488 --> 00:30:27.403\nAnd what it's asking is basically, how do\nI tell this image apart from other images?\n\n614\n00:30:27.403 --> 00:30:30.273\nI might have more than one\nimage with the same name, so\n\n615\n00:30:30.273 --> 00:30:31.743\nhow do I know they're different?\n\n616\n00:30:31.743 --> 00:30:35.863\nWell you give them an index number and the\nrandom option is the default, but you can\n\n617\n00:30:35.863 --> 00:30:39.950\ncome in and tell it assign specific\nimage and it'll give it that number.\n\n618\n00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:45.192\nSo I might have two El Capitan installs\none is index five and one is index seven,\n\n619\n00:30:45.192 --> 00:30:49.813\nand I know that five is for\naccountants and seven is for sales people.\n\n620\n00:30:49.813 --> 00:30:53.510\nMaybe there's some variation in there or\nwhatever, but I keep track of that.\n\n621\n00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:57.070\nMost of us don't care most of us just give\nit a name that makes sense this is for\n\n622\n00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:00.050\naccountants so whatever that's\nthe easy way to go about it.\n\n623\n00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:04.323\nWhere index numbers really come in\nhandy is if you have more than one\n\n624\n00:31:04.323 --> 00:31:05.708\nnet install server.\n\n625\n00:31:05.708 --> 00:31:08.779\nIf you have more than one\nNetInstall server you might wanna\n\n626\n00:31:08.779 --> 00:31:11.862\nshow that one image is the same\nimage as on another server.\n\n627\n00:31:11.862 --> 00:31:14.678\nSo I'm gonna have five NetInstall\nservers and I take one image and\n\n628\n00:31:14.678 --> 00:31:16.130\nI copy it five times.\n\n629\n00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.470\nHow do those servers all\nknow it's the same image?\n\n630\n00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:19.530\nThey don't.\n\n631\n00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:24.010\nUnless you say, the Image will be\nserved from multiple servers or\n\n632\n00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:25.600\nyou give it a number that's appropriate.\n\n633\n00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:32.129\nNow if you look really close right here,\nsee how it says, (1-65535).\n\n634\n00:31:32.129 --> 00:31:35.607\nThat's the index number kind\nof range they can have and\n\n635\n00:31:35.607 --> 00:31:38.340\nthe number actually does mean something.\n\n636\n00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:42.419\nWhen I float over it, there's this\nlittle mouse tip that kind of appears.\n\n637\n00:31:42.419 --> 00:31:44.099\nI think I called it a tooltip.\n\n638\n00:31:44.099 --> 00:31:47.221\nAnd see how it says\n1-4095 is a standalone?\n\n639\n00:31:47.221 --> 00:31:51.865\nAnd then 4,096 through\n65,535 is load balanced.\n\n640\n00:31:51.865 --> 00:31:52.866\nWhat does that mean?\n\n641\n00:31:52.866 --> 00:31:58.730\nWell, 4,096 or higher is an image that's\ngonna be stored on more than one server.\n\n642\n00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:02.850\nSo if I have five servers and\nI create image number 5,000,\n\n643\n00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:06.080\nI could put that one image\non five different services.\n\n644\n00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.300\nAs long as I always\nnumbered it five thousand,\n\n645\n00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.430\nthey servers would all know\nit was the same image.\n\n646\n00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:13.210\nAnd when a client boots up and\ngoes to install, it can grab the image\n\n647\n00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:16.830\nfrom any of the five servers and it lets\nme load balance, or build redundancy.\n\n648\n00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.105\nOr distributed effort across servers.\n\n649\n00:32:19.105 --> 00:32:22.675\nSo that's really good when you\nhave a high number of machines.\n\n650\n00:32:22.675 --> 00:32:27.315\nApple actually recommends that you don't\nhave more than 50 machines downloading\n\n651\n00:32:27.315 --> 00:32:29.185\nfrom a server at one time.\n\n652\n00:32:29.185 --> 00:32:32.385\nSo, if you have a classroom\nof 50 machines,\n\n653\n00:32:32.385 --> 00:32:34.850\nthey could run off of\none net install server.\n\n654\n00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:38.100\nIf you had 10,000 machines,\nyou could still run off of\n\n655\n00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:41.190\none NetInstall server as long as you\nnever reimage more than 50 at a time.\n\n656\n00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:44.790\nBut if you knew you were\ngoing to be re-imaging 100 or\n\n657\n00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:48.060\n200 at a time, you'd want to add more\nNetInstall servers to account for that.\n\n658\n00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.480\nAnd you would just need to make sure\nthat whenever you created an image,\n\n659\n00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.730\nand that you cloned the image across\nmore than one NetInstall server,\n\n660\n00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:56.560\nthat you always give it\nthe same Index number.\n\n661\n00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.670\nAnd it needs to be 4096 or higher, so\n\n662\n00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:02.160\nthat it knows that it's\na load balanced index number.\n\n663\n00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.850\nIf it's 4095 or lower,\nit's a standalone image.\n\n664\n00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:07.490\nAnd clients will only go to one server\nto get that image, and that's it,\n\n665\n00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:09.560\nthey will not go to more\nthan one server to get it.\n\n666\n00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:15.500\nAll right, now, in my case, this is\na straight up net install of El Capitan.\n\n667\n00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.000\nI don't have any of\nthe net install servers,\n\n668\n00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.890\nbut just because I might do it in\nthe future, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n669\n00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:23.300\nchoose to assign it a specific index\nnumber, and I'm gonna give it 5,000.\n\n670\n00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.130\nSo that I can then take this and\n\n671\n00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:28.940\ncopy it to other net install servers, set\nit to index 5,000, and it'll load balance.\n\n672\n00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.260\nI'm not doing it now, but\nI'm setting myself up for\n\n673\n00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.110\nit in the future, it doesn't hurt.\n\n674\n00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:40.240\nAll right, then I can pick the hardware\nthat's allowed to get this image.\n\n675\n00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.470\nBy default it's gonna show all\nthe hardware that El Capitan supports.\n\n676\n00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:46.120\nSo, El Capitan goes all the way back.\n\n677\n00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.050\nLike the Xserve,\nthey haven't sold those things in year,\n\n678\n00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:50.070\nbut you can run El Capitan\non them if you want.\n\n679\n00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:53.100\nSo you can kinda pick and\nchoose if you want to support those,\n\n680\n00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.830\nyou can turn them off, it's all up to you.\n\n681\n00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:59.160\nAnd if you drill down inside them, you'll\nsee where you can get very Specific, so\n\n682\n00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:03.070\nthe different years, the different\nscreen sizes, it's all right in there.\n\n683\n00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:05.760\nYou're basically just picking what\nhardware will be allowed to see this.\n\n684\n00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:11.440\nAll right, then,\nFilter Clients by MAC Address.\n\n685\n00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.895\nEarlier, I showed you we could Where\nwe can filter, but it was global.\n\n686\n00:34:13.895 --> 00:34:15.725\nIt was global for the server.\n\n687\n00:34:15.725 --> 00:34:18.345\nHere, I can do a filter\njust on this image.\n\n688\n00:34:18.345 --> 00:34:20.215\nSo if this is an image of Wes' laptop and\n\n689\n00:34:20.215 --> 00:34:25.215\nit's got Wes' data in it, here I can\nfilter it to just Wes' Mac address.\n\n690\n00:34:25.215 --> 00:34:27.245\nSo I'd only be able to\nrestore it to his machine.\n\n691\n00:34:27.245 --> 00:34:28.785\nOther Mac addresses\nwouldn't be able to see it.\n\n692\n00:34:28.785 --> 00:34:30.385\nSo you can get very specific.\n\n693\n00:34:30.385 --> 00:34:33.985\nThis is usually the better way to do it,\nas opposed to doing the global filter.\n\n694\n00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.730\nAll right, and then that's about it.\n\n695\n00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:38.760\nNow, it's going to create the image.\n\n696\n00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.510\nNow when it creates the image,\n\n697\n00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:45.040\nnotice that is defaulted to\nthe NetbootSP0 folder, right.\n\n698\n00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:49.830\nBut, always double check to make sure that\nit's on the right hard drive, because,\n\n699\n00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:52.800\nyou will have a slash library,\nslash server, slash\n\n700\n00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.470\nWell it will create one inside of your\nown Macintosh HD if you're not careful.\n\n701\n00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:01.040\nSo I always like to double check that and\nmake sure that I'm on the right drive and\n\n702\n00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.390\nwhen I checked sure enough I am.\n\n703\n00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:05.440\nSo, storage, library, NetBook, NetBootSP0.\n\n704\n00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.330\nThat's exactly where I want it to be.\n\n705\n00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:10.130\nAnd so, I'll go ahead and save that.\n\n706\n00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:14.240\nNow what it's doing is\nit's going to convert\n\n707\n00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:20.410\nthe El Capitan Installer into\na network bootable installation image\n\n708\n00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:25.220\nthat clients will be able to book up off\nof and do a full install of El Capitan.\n\n709\n00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.270\nAll right.\nSo that's gonna churn along right there,\n\n710\n00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:28.530\nit's creating that image.\n\n711\n00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:31.330\nIt's not gonna take very long,\nthe image is maybe nine gigs.\n\n712\n00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:34.730\nIn fact, the longest part is gonna\nbe that I have a USB 3 drive and\n\n713\n00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:37.210\nit's gotta copy nine gigs\nof data to that drive.\n\n714\n00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:40.380\nBut it'll churn along pretty quickly,\nwe'll see some of the other images\n\n715\n00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:44.090\nlike net restore can take an hour\nto make a net restore image.\n\n716\n00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:46.500\nThis one should move along pretty fast.\n\n717\n00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:52.430\nNow once it's done, I have my first\nimage inside of my net install server,\n\n718\n00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:55.620\nand so I should be set up, I should\nbe able to flip that on switch and\n\n719\n00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:59.300\nnow we'll have net install up and\nrunning on my network.\n\n720\n00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.860\nSo we've got about 20%\nmore before that happens,\n\n721\n00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.590\nI'm going to bring my server app back up.\n\n722\n00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:06.700\nAnd really we're all set up here.\n\n723\n00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.470\nI don't have anything else to customize.\n\n724\n00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:12.020\nI just need to flip that 'on' switch\nas soon as the transfer is done.\n\n725\n00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.670\nAnd there it goes,\nfinalizing it right there, and\n\n726\n00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:17.700\nas soon as that's done\nNow we'll be in business.\n\n727\n00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:22.580\nAll right you can see all of this going\non if you browse to your hard drive.\n\n728\n00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.420\nSo if I browse into the hard drive,\nlibrary, net boot,\n\n729\n00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:29.040\nnet boot S-P zero, here's the net install.\n\n730\n00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.680\nNotice that it's a folder\nwith a file extension.\n\n731\n00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:37.570\nAll the NetBoot images, whether they\nbe NetBoot, NetRestore, or NetInstall.\n\n732\n00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:40.030\nThey all get a folder that ends in .nbi.\n\n733\n00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:44.510\nNBI just stands for\nnet boot install or net boot image.\n\n734\n00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.210\nAnd so it's got it right there.\n\n735\n00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:47.800\nIt's just a folder you\ncan browse inside of it.\n\n736\n00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:51.580\nAnd if you browse inside of it,\nyou'll see a dmg file, right?\n\n737\n00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.350\nIt is a disk image.\n\n738\n00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:54.950\nBut it's a special disc image,\n\n739\n00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:58.220\nits one that's been flagged to\nbe able to be network bootable.\n\n740\n00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.500\nAnd that's why it puts\nit in that NBI folder,\n\n741\n00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.580\nit's actually another couple little files\nthat are hidden on this, so it is creating\n\n742\n00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:07.920\na little bit of an extra structure\naround it but that's basically it.\n\n743\n00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:11.820\nAnd now that that's done, we should be\nable to jump over and turn on our image.\n\n744\n00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.370\nNow it seems to think that\nit's still copying, and\n\n745\n00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:17.450\nyeah I guess looking at my hard drive\nmy little light is still flashing.\n\n746\n00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:19.120\nBut it's less than a minute remaining.\n\n747\n00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.270\nLet's see if it will let me turn this on.\n\n748\n00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:23.967\nAnd we'll see if it starts,\neven though it's not done copying.\n\n749\n00:37:23.967 --> 00:37:26.300\n[LAUGH] Or\nif it will throw an error for us.\n\n750\n00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.560\nBut once this is done,\nwe're up and running.\n\n751\n00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.950\nNow, the image that I made.\n\n752\n00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:31.000\nYeah, not yet.\n\n753\n00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.160\nSo the image that I made is just\na clean install of El Capitan,\n\n754\n00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.130\nit's not very fancy.\n\n755\n00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.990\nWe probably want to create\nsomething fancier though.\n\n756\n00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:41.260\nAnd I'll tell you guys, net restore,\nI used the heck of those.\n\n757\n00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:45.410\nWith net restore you can have all sorts of\nstuff already set up on the machine and\n\n758\n00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:46.660\nit's a lot of fun.\n\n759\n00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:49.270\nBut I definitely didn't have time\nto cover it this episode, so\n\n760\n00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:52.260\nwe're gonna come back with\nanother episode on net restore.\n\n761\n00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.720\nAnd it's basically the same process\nas what we went through here,\n\n762\n00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.660\nexcept instead our building image\nfrom an El Capitan installer,\n\n763\n00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:01.800\nwe're going to build our image\nfrom a completely separate Mac.\n\n764\n00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.530\nA Mac that we have got set up\nas our template machine, but\n\n765\n00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:07.360\nour process tat you just say for\nnet install\n\n766\n00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.322\nreally is about the same process for\ndoing net booter or net restore.\n\n767\n00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:15.480\nAll right, this one just finished, so now\nmy image creation is officially finished.\n\n768\n00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.720\nSo I can hit Done and\nwe should be able to start.\n\n769\n00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.270\nThe service already started.\n\n770\n00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:20.370\nSo the service started for me.\n\n771\n00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:23.440\nIt's up and it's running, and\nI'm now a NetInstall server.\n\n772\n00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.480\nNotice down here I've got one image right?\n\n773\n00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.130\nIt's got a green light cuz it's active.\n\n774\n00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:29.330\nThere's that NetInstall OS ten,\nokay Capitan.\n\n775\n00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:35.370\nAnd if I hit the gear on it,\nI can set it as the default image.\n\n776\n00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:38.210\nI can edit it if I want to change\nits index number or whatever.\n\n777\n00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:40.710\nSo see how I've got the index number and\nthe filtering, so\n\n778\n00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:42.470\nyou can customize all that stuff.\n\n779\n00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:45.440\nBut That default image\nis kind of important.\n\n780\n00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:49.110\nWhen somebody boots their computer up\nthere's two ways they can boot it.\n\n781\n00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:53.370\nOne way is they can just do\nlike to do a network boot.\n\n782\n00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:55.420\nSo they can hold n while they\nboot to do a network boot.\n\n783\n00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.500\nIt will in the net install server and\n\n784\n00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.100\nit will install whatever\nis the default image.\n\n785\n00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.530\nThey don't get a choice.\n\n786\n00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:06.110\nWhen you boot off a network,\nyou install the default image, no choices.\n\n787\n00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:09.350\nSo if I have a lab of 50 computers and\n\n788\n00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:12.390\nI set the default image as\na net install for them.\n\n789\n00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.400\nI could walk around the room\nat the end of the day,\n\n790\n00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:18.570\nturn off all the machines,\npower them on while holding n And\n\n791\n00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:21.090\nthey'll reach out that NetInstall server\nand wipe themselves, and that's it.\n\n792\n00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:22.930\nSo just power it on and hold N.\n\n793\n00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:24.940\nThat's the light touch I\nwas talking about earlier.\n\n794\n00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:32.090\nBut if you wanna pick, the way you\npick is, you boot up your computer,\n\n795\n00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:37.150\neither into recovery or to full Mac OS,\nAnd you use the start up disk preference.\n\n796\n00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:39.380\nAnd you go into startup disk and\nit'll show the net install.\n\n797\n00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.500\nSo we'll see it in the episode where\nwe actually apply these images.\n\n798\n00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.390\nBut it is important to\nset at least one default.\n\n799\n00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:45.620\nWell, you can only have one default, so\n\n800\n00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:48.470\nit's important to set a default\nbecause that's the one that\n\n801\n00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:51.400\nwill automatically be installed when\npeople boot up holding N on the keyboard.\n\n802\n00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.760\nAll right, well at this point,\nwe are an operational net install server.\n\n803\n00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.990\nWe've got a typical net\ninstall image in place.\n\n804\n00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:00.710\nThis is a pretty good stopping for\nus though,\n\n805\n00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:03.250\nbecause the next thing I want to do,\nI want to show you guys net restore.\n\n806\n00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:05.350\nSo we'll do that in another episode.\n\n807\n00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:07.640\n>> Very good, well Don, thank you for\nall of this information.\n\n808\n00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.160\nAnd that's right,\n\n809\n00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:11.030\nwe are definitely flexing the muscles\nof the clock here on that one.\n\n810\n00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:15.200\nSo, Don you got anything else for\nus in this episode before we sign off?\n\n811\n00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.320\n>> Remember to keep these images updated,\nright?\n\n812\n00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.725\nSo my ten point eleven o three.\n\n813\n00:40:20.725 --> 00:40:23.450\n10.11.4 is out so\nI probably need to update that.\n\n814\n00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:25.740\nIt's not a set it and forget it thing.\n\n815\n00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:29.050\nIf I don't update this, and\nI roll it out to 1,000 machines,\n\n816\n00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:32.390\nthat's 1,000 machines that now\nneed to do the 10.11.4 update.\n\n817\n00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:34.120\nI can manage that with\na software update server,\n\n818\n00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.700\nbut it would have been better if I just\ndeployed it out there in the first place.\n\n819\n00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.040\nSo you gotta keep these updated.\n\n820\n00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.590\nWell, thanks for\nall that information, Don.\n\n821\n00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:42.430\nAnd thanks to you,\nthe viewer out there for watching.\n\n822\n00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:44.330\nWe're going to go ahead and\nsign out at ITPro TV.\n\n823\n00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:45.450\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n824\n00:40:45.450 -->

00:00:19.250\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and in today's\nepisode we are continuing through our\n\n4\n00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.140\nOS X server essentials course and\nwe are focusing in on implementing\n\n5\n00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.770\ndeployment solutions specifically we're\nlooking at deployment with net restore.\n\n6\n00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.220\nWe've got Don Pezet joining us\nin the studio to help us out.\n\n7\n00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.560\nDon how you doing today sir?\n\n8\n00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.390\n>> I'm doing great Wes ready to pick up\nwhere we left off in the last episode.\n\n9\n00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.560\nIf you didn't watch it our last\nepisode was on net install.\n\n10\n00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.340\nThen we had a chance to see how to\ncreate a net install server in the OS X\n\n11\n00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.220\nserver app, and\nto create our first net install image,\n\n12\n00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.928\nwhich was just a network\ninstallable version of El Capitan.\n\n13\n00:00:47.928 --> 00:00:50.350\nIf you wanna do a nice clean\ninstall that worked out,\n\n14\n00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.570\nit was pretty easy,\nwe tackled that all in the last episode.\n\n15\n00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.850\nBut one of the things we didn't get to\nwas what's called a NetRestore Image.\n\n16\n00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.990\nAnd I said it in the last episode,\nthis is what I normally use,\n\n17\n00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.640\nI normally use NetRestore.\n\n18\n00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.660\nBecause it's got a lot more power to it.\n\n19\n00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.560\nWith NetRestore we can do a network\ninstall, not just of El Capitan, But\n\n20\n00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.400\nEl Capitan with applications and\nconfiguration settings packaged in with\n\n21\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.950\nit, we can get it set up exactly the way\nwe want it and deploy it to our heart's\n\n22\n00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.310\ncontent knowing that it's all set\nup the way that we need it to be.\n\n23\n00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.610\nSo, it's a pretty cool feature,\n\n24\n00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.520\nbut we set it up a different\nway than we do with NetInstall.\n\n25\n00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.520\nWith NetInstall, if you didn't watch the\nepisode, we created an installation image,\n\n26\n00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.590\nand the source of that image\nwas the El Capitan installer.\n\n27\n00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.210\nSo I downloaded the El Capitan\ninstaller from the app store, and\n\n28\n00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.476\nI used that image to\nconvert it into NetInstall.\n\n29\n00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:43.812\nWith NetRestore it's not like that.\n\n30\n00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:46.742\nWith NetRestore we don't\nuse an image as our source.\n\n31\n00:01:46.742 --> 00:01:49.820\nWhen NetRestore,\nwe use an actual machine as our source.\n\n32\n00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.870\nSo over here on the table\nwith me I've got a Mac Mini.\n\n33\n00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.770\nAnd the Mac Mini is up and it's running\nand it's, I believe, running El Capitan.\n\n34\n00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.650\nNow that I think about it, I really\nhope it is because If we want to take\n\n35\n00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.720\na NetRestore image, we have to clone this\nphysical machine to create the image.\n\n36\n00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.320\nAnd I'm gonna use my laptop\nto create that image.\n\n37\n00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.480\nSo using net restore requires two\nmachines, a source machine and\n\n38\n00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.210\nthe server, right?\n\n39\n00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.640\nSo the source is the machine that I've got\nset up exactly the way that I want it and\n\n40\n00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.030\nthe server is what I'm gonna\nuse to create that image.\n\n41\n00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.640\nSo my laptop is gonna act as that server.\n\n42\n00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.520\nWell, the machine that's taking\nthe image needs to be running\n\n43\n00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.730\nthe same operating system as the machine\nthat is the source of the image.\n\n44\n00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.120\nSo if my image is El capitan,\nI need my laptop to be El Capitan.\n\n45\n00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.780\nIf my source machine is Yosemite,\nI need my laptop to be Yosemite.\n\n46\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.010\nThey've gotta be the same version in order\nfor the image process to work, all right?\n\n47\n00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.800\nSo let's jut start there\nwhere I've got this Mac Mini\n\n48\n00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.730\nlet's verify what OS it's running.\n\n49\n00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.760\nSo on my Mac, I'm gonna go ahead and\njust jump in here and\n\n50\n00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.250\nI'll go into my System Preferences and,\nactually I don't have to go there,\n\n51\n00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.990\nI can just go to About This Mac and\nfind out.\n\n52\n00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.112\nAnd hopefully it's running El Capitan and\nit is, perfect.\n\n53\n00:03:03.112 --> 00:03:07.117\nSo it's running 10.11.3,\n10.11.4 is the latest.\n\n54\n00:03:07.117 --> 00:03:10.130\nI'm running 10.11.4 on my laptop,\nbut that's not a big deal.\n\n55\n00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.340\nAs long as I'm running El Capitan and\n\n56\n00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.890\nthis Mac Mini is running El Capitan we're\ngonna be able to make a net restore image.\n\n57\n00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.960\nNow, this machine is actually\na stock install of El Capitan.\n\n58\n00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.990\nWe just installed it on here and\nthere's nothing really customized or\n\n59\n00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.210\nspecial about it.\n\n60\n00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.850\nSo if I make a net restore image of this.\n\n61\n00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.980\nIt's not really any different\nthan using a NetInstall image.\n\n62\n00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.100\nA NetInstall is a clean\ninstallation Capitan.\n\n63\n00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.180\nIt's the customization\nthat sets this apart and\n\n64\n00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.340\nwhat are some of the things\nthat we might customize?\n\n65\n00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.450\nWell, you might install third\nparty software, maybe you don't\n\n66\n00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.320\nlike Safari and so you want to\ninstall Chrome on the machine, right?\n\n67\n00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.740\nSo let me see if I downloaded that or not.\n\n68\n00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.270\nIf we install Google Chrome\nas our web browser, no,\n\n69\n00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.980\nI don't have it on here so\nlet's go on and install it, right?\n\n70\n00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.080\nSo I'll fire up Safari and\nwe'll just install it.\n\n71\n00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.610\nWe can start to customize things and\n\n72\n00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.860\nthat will become part of the image\nthat's going to be this machine.\n\n73\n00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.330\nSo we could install any software, right?\n\n74\n00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.340\nI'm using Google Chrome as an example but\nmaybe it's some accounting software you\n\n75\n00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.790\nhave or some custom line of business\napplication that only your company uses.\n\n76\n00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.420\nWhatever it is that you want,\nyou get it installed and\n\n77\n00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.070\nyou get it set up on the machine, okay?\n\n78\n00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.780\nAlso settings, things like your power\nmanagement settings, your screen saver,\n\n79\n00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.580\nyour wallpaper.\n\n80\n00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.240\nYou can create user accounts.\n\n81\n00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.550\nMaybe I know for a fact that I'm\ngonna be using Apple Remote Desktop.\n\n82\n00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.200\nWell if I'm gonna use\nApple remote desktop,\n\n83\n00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.030\nthe first time it connects to a client,\nit needs a valid user name and a password.\n\n84\n00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.430\nSo maybe I want to have\na valid username and\n\n85\n00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.670\na password to create on these\nmachines ahead of time.\n\n86\n00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.100\nThe best way to handle it is\nto use Open Directory and\n\n87\n00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.600\nwe saw on NetInstall you can get an image\nto join Open Directory real easy.\n\n88\n00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.770\nBut in lieu of that,\n\n89\n00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.780\nif I don't have an open directory, I need\na valid user account here that I can use.\n\n90\n00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.700\nActually it looks like my download\nfinished here first so let's go ahead and\n\n91\n00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.740\njust get that Chrome installer running.\n\n92\n00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.810\nAnd I'll get Chrome installing and\nthen I'll create that user account for\n\n93\n00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.150\nApple remote desktop.\n\n94\n00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.620\nWell, I said get it running.\n\n95\n00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.670\nI guess we have to verify and\nall that stuff.\n\n96\n00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.090\nThis is all time consuming.\n\n97\n00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.298\nSo we'll bounce back and\nforth between the two things.\n\n98\n00:05:13.298 --> 00:05:16.950\nI'm also gonna jump into my system\npreferences here and I'm going to go and\n\n99\n00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.900\ncreate a new user account.\n\n100\n00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.750\n[LAUGH] I'm multi tasking today,\nI'm gonna end up regretting this aren't I?\n\n101\n00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.690\nBut if I go into my users and\ngroups and so\n\n102\n00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.250\nmaybe I wanna create some account\nthat I already know about, right?\n\n103\n00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.540\nSo I'm gonna unlock this panel.\n\n104\n00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.730\nAnd then I'll just add a new user account.\n\n105\n00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.080\nAnd I'll call it maybe\nsomething like ARD or\n\n106\n00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.260\nApple Remote Desktop, ard.\n\n107\n00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.050\nAnd, shoot,\nthat's a reserve system name isn't it?\n\n108\n00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.090\nSo we'll just call it ard, all right?\n\n109\n00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.250\nAnd then I'll give it a password and\n\n110\n00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.280\nthat way I just have this valid account\nthat's already sitting right here.\n\n111\n00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.510\nAnd I might take this image and\ndeploy it to 5,000 machines.\n\n112\n00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.170\nBut now all 5,000 machines are gonna\nhave this valid ard account.\n\n113\n00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.050\nNow, there's some risk here,\nright, from a security standpoint.\n\n114\n00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.160\nIf somebody figures out that password,\n\n115\n00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.380\nthey now have a valid\naccount on all my machines.\n\n116\n00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.270\nSo what I need, the first thing I do\nwith ard is connect to the machine and\n\n117\n00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.920\nthen either remove this account or\nchange this password, right?\n\n118\n00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.760\nIt's very easy to do that from inside\nthe ard once you get connected.\n\n119\n00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.310\nThis is just to make sure I can\nget connected in the first place.\n\n120\n00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.120\nSo I've got that user\naccount created right there.\n\n121\n00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.180\nIt's got a pretty flower.\n\n122\n00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.350\nI could change that I guess but\nI don't really care, so I'll leave that.\n\n123\n00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.450\nAnd let's go see how Chrome is doing.\n\n124\n00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.240\nSo Chrome is installing in\nthe background and should be done.\n\n125\n00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.130\nSo if I go into my applications\nI should have Google Chrome and\n\n126\n00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.830\nthere we go and who knows maybe I\nwanna pin that to my bar or whatever.\n\n127\n00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.750\nI'm gonna hit Open to make\nsure it's okay to run it and\n\n128\n00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.620\nthat's gonna fire up\ngood old Google Chrome.\n\n129\n00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.670\nAnd we could do other\ncustomizations too and\n\n130\n00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.410\nnot just limited to installing things,\nright?\n\n131\n00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.190\nSo like all this stuff down here in my\ndock maybe I don't use reminders, so\n\n132\n00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.020\nI'm gonna come in here and\nremove reminders.\n\n133\n00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.670\nBy doing these things, right?\n\n134\n00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.280\nI'm changing my image.\n\n135\n00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.480\nI'm changing it from the default\nthat Apple set for us and\n\n136\n00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.380\nI'm making it something new, right?\n\n137\n00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.520\nMaking it the way that I want it for\nmy company.\n\n138\n00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.520\nAnd that way if I deploy this\nout to a thousand machines,\n\n139\n00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.280\nthey're all setup the same way.\n\n140\n00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.350\nThey've all got the same\nicons in the dock.\n\n141\n00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.410\nThey've got the same wallpaper.\n\n142\n00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.880\nThey've got the same\nwhatever it is that I want\n\n143\n00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.900\nthat's all kind of set the same way,\nright?\n\n144\n00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.390\nThat's what this is really all about.\n\n145\n00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:29.680\nNow, once that's done, I now have\nmy reference machine, my source.\n\n146\n00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.700\nThis is the machine is gonna\nserve as the source of the image.\n\n147\n00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.660\nAnd so I need to take this machine and\nget through all these crazy questions out,\n\n148\n00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.130\nyeah we'll make Chrome our\ndefault browser and there we go.\n\n149\n00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.248\nAnd so\nonce all that's done now I can go in and\n\n150\n00:07:47.248 --> 00:07:51.307\nI can start to make my image\nbased on this machine, okay.\n\n151\n00:07:51.307 --> 00:07:53.829\nNow, I think I mentioned\nthis in the last episode but\n\n152\n00:07:53.829 --> 00:07:57.381\nmaking an imagine in the machine is not\njust a one time thing and your done,\n\n153\n00:07:57.381 --> 00:08:00.705\nit's something that you're going\nto have to do over and over again,\n\n154\n00:08:00.705 --> 00:08:03.206\nright Why would we have to do it over and\nover again?\n\n155\n00:08:03.206 --> 00:08:04.466\nWell it's things like updates and\n\n156\n00:08:04.466 --> 00:08:07.530\nlittle changes that we have to make\nas part of maintaining that image.\n\n157\n00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:08.430\n>> So at this point,\n\n158\n00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:12.570\nDon, before you capture or create this\nimage, you make sure that your production\n\n159\n00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.970\nimage has all any line of\nbusiness applications, all the.\n\n160\n00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.130\n>> The default settings, not default\nsettings, customized settings and\n\n161\n00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.090\neverything that you need.\n\n162\n00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:20.750\nYeah.\nBasically,\n\n163\n00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.110\nyou just set it the way you want it and\n\n164\n00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.370\nknow that if you miss a setting,\nit's not the end of the world.\n\n165\n00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.620\nIf you rolled this out to a thousand\nmachines though and you miss something and\n\n166\n00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.000\nyou go, I need to fix that.\n\n167\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.930\nWell, if it's a little tweak it would be\nfaster to use Apple Remote Desktop to push\n\n168\n00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:38.080\nthat tweak out to the thousand machines,\nthen it would be to reimage them.\n\n169\n00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.940\nBut, you can change it in the source image\n>> And now going forward,\n\n170\n00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.490\nany new machines you image\nwill be set properly.\n\n171\n00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.530\nAnd that's a little bit of\na tricky part there, is,\n\n172\n00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.220\nremember with that NetInstall image?\n\n173\n00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.890\nI used the El Capitan\ninstaller as my source.\n\n174\n00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.280\nBut here, I'm using an actual\ncomputer as the source.\n\n175\n00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.370\nSo, if I need to change something,\n\n176\n00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.590\nI'm gonna need the source computer again,\naren't I?\n\n177\n00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.940\nRight?\nOr, another machine.\n\n178\n00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.800\nYou've always gotta have some physical\nmachine to serve as that source for\n\n179\n00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.660\nNetinstall.\n\n180\n00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.020\nYou probably could use\na virtual machine for that.\n\n181\n00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.490\nBut Apple really wants it to be true,\nphysical hardware.\n\n182\n00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.370\nSo I've got two choices how I\nwanna handle updates, right?\n\n183\n00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.040\nMy first choice is the easiest.\n\n184\n00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.340\nAnd that says, hey,\nthis Mac Mini here is my source.\n\n185\n00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.230\nI'm just gonna keep it as\na dedicated source from now on.\n\n186\n00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.270\nThis Mac will sit right here on my desk.\n\n187\n00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.740\nNobody will use it.\n\n188\n00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.840\nAny time I wanna update the image, I can\njust go and change it on this machine, and\n\n189\n00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.640\nrebuild the image, right?\n\n190\n00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.580\nOn a positive side, that's easy.\n\n191\n00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.960\nOn a negative side,\nI'm wasting an entire Mac.\n\n192\n00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.100\nSomebody could be using this.\n\n193\n00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.650\nSomebody could actually be putting\nit to some use in production,\n\n194\n00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:41.530\nas opposed to just sitting here on\nthe table gathering dust most of the time.\n\n195\n00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.720\nCuz how often do we update our images?\n\n196\n00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.860\nOnce a month, right, so\nit gets used 12 times a year.\n\n197\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.740\nThe rest of the time it just sits\nthere and it does nothing, right.\n\n198\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.690\nBut the other option is I can go ahead and\ndeploy this Mac in production.\n\n199\n00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.770\nBut now anytime I wanted to update\nthe image, I'd have to go and\n\n200\n00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.720\nget a Mac, and it could be a desktop,\nlaptop, doesn't matter.\n\n201\n00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.170\nI have to go and get a Mac.\n\n202\n00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:08.000\nI can deploy my image to it and then\nmake the changes and rebuild the image.\n\n203\n00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.250\nSo now it takes longer to make a change so\nthat's the tradeoff.\n\n204\n00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.040\nI can have a dedicated source\nmachine which wastes hardware but\n\n205\n00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:21.350\nsaves time or I can just use any old\nmachine on my network that I can grab\n\n206\n00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.630\nwhich saves on hardware but\nis not as fast, right?\n\n207\n00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.280\nSo you gotta pick which one is right for\nyou.\n\n208\n00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.610\nIf you're on a shoestring budget,\n\n209\n00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.440\nyou probably don't have the extra\nhardware laying around that you can use.\n\n210\n00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.460\nSo just take one of your existing\nmachines, redeploy the image to it so\n\n211\n00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:38.230\nit's fresh and clean, make your changes\nand then rebuild your image, okay.\n\n212\n00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:41.070\nNow this machine,\nI've customized it a little bit.\n\n213\n00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.290\nWe installed Chrome,\nI removed some icons from the taskbar,\n\n214\n00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.890\nI created that Apple Remote Desktop\naccount, right.\n\n215\n00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.290\nSo I've done a few little things to it.\n\n216\n00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.860\nNow I need to take the image.\n\n217\n00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.000\nWell with Netinstall I ran\nthe system image utility,\n\n218\n00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.020\nand the system image utility ran and\nit cloned.\n\n219\n00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.940\nThat install image from earlier.\n\n220\n00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.840\nBut, I'm gonna use that same utility here,\nbut\n\n221\n00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.870\nit works different when\nwe're doing net restore.\n\n222\n00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.180\nWith net restore,\n\n223\n00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.740\nit can't clone this hard drive because\nthe hard drive is running right now.\n\n224\n00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.860\nIf we bring it up here, let me show you.\n\n225\n00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:18.990\nSo if I fire up the system image\nutility if I can find it there we go.\n\n226\n00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.900\nWhen I run the system image utility,\nit shows me my sources.\n\n227\n00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.785\nAnd the source in the last episode we\nused the install image for El Capitan.\n\n228\n00:11:26.785 --> 00:11:28.735\nHere, no sources found.\n\n229\n00:11:28.735 --> 00:11:32.215\nWell I haven't downloaded\nthe El Capitan installer and\n\n230\n00:11:32.215 --> 00:11:36.515\nit can't clone the hard drive,\nthe Macintosh HD, because it's running.\n\n231\n00:11:36.515 --> 00:11:39.985\nSo what we have to use is\nwhat's called target mode.\n\n232\n00:11:39.985 --> 00:11:45.045\nTarget mode is where I boot this Mac up,\nnot as a Mac, but as a hard drive.\n\n233\n00:11:45.045 --> 00:11:48.790\nWe can boot it up into a mode where\nit acts like an external hard drive.\n\n234\n00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:52.250\nAnd then I can hook it up to another\ncomputer which makes it easier for\n\n235\n00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.760\nme to clone it and\nmake an image of it, okay?\n\n236\n00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.260\nSo kind of a neat little process there but\n\n237\n00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.400\nit's gonna require a little\nbit of extra effort.\n\n238\n00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.860\nFirst off, if it's a newer Mac,\nwe're gonna use Thunderbolt for it.\n\n239\n00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.920\nSo I'm gonna need a Thunderbolt cable so\nthat I can run from the Thunderbolt\n\n240\n00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.510\nport of this Mac mini to the Thunderbolt\nport on my laptop, all right.\n\n241\n00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.600\nIf it's older you might have FireWire.\n\n242\n00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.480\nAnd so you can run FireWire across the\ntwo, but you're gonna need Thunderbolt or\n\n243\n00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.260\nFireWire to be able to pull this off.\n\n244\n00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.290\nIf you've got like a Mac Book Air\n\n245\n00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.580\nwell it's only got usbc that's not\nreally gonna help you much is it?\n\n246\n00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.060\nSo your gonna use some\nvarious adapters and\n\n247\n00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.700\nthings to get that configured and\nconnected.\n\n248\n00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.270\nBut typically we're gonna be\nusing thunderbolt for this.\n\n249\n00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.680\nSo in order to do that I need\nto get a thunderbolt cable,\n\n250\n00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.130\nI just happen to have one right here\ncause I knew I was doing this show.\n\n251\n00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.400\nBe careful with thunderbolt\ncables because they're special,\n\n252\n00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.800\nthey're not like normal display for cables\nwhich have the same connector on them.\n\n253\n00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.308\nThunderbolt cables actually have\na little bit of logic in them.\n\n254\n00:12:45.308 --> 00:12:48.950\nIn these connectors there's\na little bit of circuitry and\n\n255\n00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.520\npart of is digital rights management.\n\n256\n00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.220\nBut part of it is machine host\nidentification and negotiation.\n\n257\n00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.860\nAnd we need that to happen for\nthis to work.\n\n258\n00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:00.070\nSo I've got an official Apple cable,\nthey're expensive for what they are.\n\n259\n00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.280\nI mean, they should be cheap.\n\n260\n00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.420\nI think the cable's like $80.\n\n261\n00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:09.230\nSo, they're kinda pricey but you do need\nto have at least an Apple certified cable.\n\n262\n00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.310\nI know Belkin makes them.\n\n263\n00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.000\nThey're not much less expensive.\n\n264\n00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.170\nAnd then what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna run it from the Thunderbolt port\n\n265\n00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:18.410\nof the Mac Mini to the Thunderbolt\nport on my Macbook right.\n\n266\n00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:22.290\nNow when I connect that up absolutely\nnothing is gonna happen right so\n\n267\n00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:26.670\nI'm gonna plug one end into a Thunderbolt\nport here on the Mac mini and\n\n268\n00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.920\nI'll plug one into my laptop.\n\n269\n00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.830\nAnd if we're watching on either device but\nreally if we watch on the Mac mini nothing\n\n270\n00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.860\nhappens, if we watch on my\nlaptop nothing happens.\n\n271\n00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.930\nIt's as if I didn't plug\nin anything at all.\n\n272\n00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.910\nAll right, and the reason is,\nit's expecting a hard drive or\n\n273\n00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:41.730\na monitor, right?\n\n274\n00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.550\nIt's not expecting another computer\nto be on the other end of that\n\n275\n00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.220\nThunderbolt cable.\n\n276\n00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.790\nSo now that it's hooked up,\nI need to boot this Mac and\n\n277\n00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:52.990\ntell it, don't boot as a computer,\nboot as a hard drive.\n\n278\n00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.180\nAnd the way we do that is\nby holding down the letter\n\n279\n00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.950\nT on the keyboard while we boot.\n\n280\n00:13:57.950 --> 00:13:59.520\nThat's gonna boot us into target mode.\n\n281\n00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.000\nSo let's jump over to that mac mini,\nand I'm gonna shut it down.\n\n282\n00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.380\nAnd so we'll just shut this thing down.\n\n283\n00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.880\nI do want to gracefully shut it down, and\nnot like yank the power cord or anything.\n\n284\n00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.630\nSo, it's shutting down.\n\n285\n00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.000\nAnd then as soon as it's off,\n\n286\n00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.400\nI'm gonna press the power button\nwhile holding T on the keyboard.\n\n287\n00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.010\nI'm just verifying the power\nlight is off there.\n\n288\n00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:23.660\nSo I'm gonna hold down T on the keyboard,\nand it's gonna boot into target mode.\n\n289\n00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:29.500\nNow, if you do it right, you should see a\nbig thunderbolt icon appear on the screen.\n\n290\n00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.400\nIf it was FireWire,\nyou'd see a big FireWire icon up here.\n\n291\n00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.180\nSo one or the other of those\ntwo icons is going to show up,\n\n292\n00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.720\nand now you're booted into target mode,\nokay?\n\n293\n00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.130\nNow on this Mac mini,\nit's technically a hard drive, and so\n\n294\n00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:46.510\nthere's not really anything else I\ncan do from the Mac mini itself.\n\n295\n00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.290\nThe rest I'm gonna do from my laptop, so\n\n296\n00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:53.620\nI can jump over to my laptop now and\nI can start to work with this.\n\n297\n00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:57.374\nAnd on my laptop you'll notice\nI've got my Macintosh HD,\n\n298\n00:14:57.374 --> 00:15:02.480\nthat's the hard drive from my\nlaptop right, it's a 500 gig drive.\n\n299\n00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.190\nAnd so that's it sitting right there.\n\n300\n00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:09.770\nBut as I scroll down,\nI've got another Macintosh HD, right?\n\n301\n00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.400\nThat's not my hard drive.\n\n302\n00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.000\nThat's the Mac mini's hard drive.\n\n303\n00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.490\nIt shows as removable,\nit's got the yellow drive icon so\n\n304\n00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:20.120\nI know it's a removable drive\nthat's called Macintosh HD.\n\n305\n00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.570\nThat's the Mac Mini.\n\n306\n00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.130\nI can see its hard drive and\nit's not running and\n\n307\n00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.930\nthat means I can make\nan image of this drive.\n\n308\n00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:35.580\nSo, when I fire up the system image\nutility, now when we go to the sources,\n\n309\n00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:40.300\nI can choose the El Capitan installer,\nlike I did in the last episode.\n\n310\n00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.470\nAnd I can choose the Macintosh HD.\n\n311\n00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.890\nI've got that choice right there.\n\n312\n00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:48.750\nIt sees the hard drive it sees\nthat it's 18 gigs in size,\n\n313\n00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.420\nwell it's actually a terabyte hard\ndrive at least I think it is.\n\n314\n00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.066\nLet's find out, let me make sure\nI'm telling you guys the truth.\n\n315\n00:15:54.066 --> 00:15:58.422\nSo when I look at that hard drive, yeah\nit's a terabyte hard drive which is kinda\n\n316\n00:15:58.422 --> 00:16:01.360\nfunny because I'm gonna\nimage that in my hard drive.\n\n317\n00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.591\nIf we look at my hard drive\nit is only 500 gigs, so\n\n318\n00:16:04.591 --> 00:16:08.250\nI'm half the size of that\ndrive how can I image it.\n\n319\n00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.880\nWell when you build the image file it's\nonly getting the files themselves,\n\n320\n00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.770\nthere's not make of all the empty space.\n\n321\n00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.970\nAnd so I've really only got 18 gigs of\ndata on that drive that it's gonna back\n\n322\n00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:22.050\nup, and so it's gonna grab that and\nturn it into this image.\n\n323\n00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:26.920\nAnd so I'm gonna pick that\nMacintosh HD and I'll hit Next, and\n\n324\n00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.000\nit's gonna ask what I want to\ndo in that boot when I restarts.\n\n325\n00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.280\nIf I do net boot,\nI'll create a bootable image.\n\n326\n00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.430\nAnybody in the building can boot of of,\nand they all run.\n\n327\n00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.100\nOS 10,L Capiton with Chrome,\n\n328\n00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:45.160\nwith RDA kinda run in Whatsapp but\nrun it from the LAN.\n\n329\n00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.740\nAnd it won't save their changes and\nall that other good stuff, but\n\n330\n00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:48.930\nI wanna do NetRestore.\n\n331\n00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.720\nThis is so\nthat I can quickly deploy this out and\n\n332\n00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.530\nget all my machines set up the same way.\n\n333\n00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.990\nSo I'll choose the NetRestore Image.\n\n334\n00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.590\nAnd we'll hit Next.\n\n335\n00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:57.520\nJust like NetInstall,\n\n336\n00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.850\nI've got to agree to the licensing\nagreement cuz we are installing OS X.\n\n337\n00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:04.750\nAnd in fact, for the rest of this wizard,\nit's identical to NetInstall's.\n\n338\n00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.120\nSo, if you watched the NetInstall episode,\nyou've already seen this.\n\n339\n00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.220\nBut, I can add configuration profiles,\npackages,\n\n340\n00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:14.480\nI can additional software scripts,\nI can put in whatever I need here.\n\n341\n00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.640\nAnd if I hit the Customize button,\nI can go into the Automater.\n\n342\n00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.590\nAnd in the Automater, I can customize and\ntweak and do whatever I want.\n\n343\n00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:23.760\nSo ideally, on the source machine,\n\n344\n00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.050\nI've already set up\neverything the way I wanted.\n\n345\n00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:29.300\nBut if there was something that I missed\nor forgot, I can always add it in here.\n\n346\n00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.071\nOr just something that I wanted to do\nbeyond the normal, I could punch in here.\n\n347\n00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.707\nAll right on the next screen,\nit's just asking about the computer name,\n\n348\n00:17:38.707 --> 00:17:39.740\nhow we wanna name that.\n\n349\n00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.430\nI'll just leave it be.\n\n350\n00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:45.790\nAnd directory server if I wanna bind\nto an open directory server, I can.\n\n351\n00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:49.010\nThen the install option and\njust like in the last episode,\n\n352\n00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:52.600\nthis is what truly determines whether\nthis'll be an automated install or\n\n353\n00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.740\nan install where we get asked Questions.\n\n354\n00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:59.780\nI'm gonna automatically install to\na hard drive called MacIntosh HD.\n\n355\n00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:03.180\nAnd I'll erase the target volume\nbefore installing so it's clean.\n\n356\n00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.230\nI don't wanna preserve data from before.\n\n357\n00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:10.660\nNow, if you have a computer, let's say\nthat I'm backing up Wes's computer.\n\n358\n00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:11.900\nAnd Wes's hard drive fails.\n\n359\n00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.310\nAnd so I go and buy a blank hard drive\nthat The Best Buy or whatever and\n\n360\n00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:16.080\nI throw it in his computer.\n\n361\n00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.250\nIs that hard drive gonna\nbe called Macintosh HD?\n\n362\n00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:20.030\nNo.\n\n363\n00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.950\nSo it's gonna look for\na hard drive called Macintosh HD.\n\n364\n00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:25.350\nIt's not gonna find one and\nit's going to now be an automated install.\n\n365\n00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.670\nSo if I'm worried about that I need\nto jump over to the automator and\n\n366\n00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.820\njust add a step in there to format\nthe hard drive and name it Macintosh HD.\n\n367\n00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.700\nThat'll take care of that and\nmake sure that it is automated.\n\n368\n00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:39.110\nBut as it stands, every Mac ships in the\nfactory with a drive called Macintosh HD.\n\n369\n00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.810\nSo it's a pretty safe bet.\n\n370\n00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:45.390\n>> Don, if it was looking for\nthat Macintosh HD drive, and\n\n371\n00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.940\nyou didn't do the automator steps,\ncould you run the risk of it failing, or\n\n372\n00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.400\njust pausing in the process?\n\n373\n00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.060\nIs just pops up a question.\n\n374\n00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:53.630\nRight?\nSo\n\n375\n00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.300\nif you're hoping to run through\na room of 50 computers and\n\n376\n00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:00.120\njust hold N on the keyboard while it boots\nup and be done that's not going to happen.\n\n377\n00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.630\nNow you got to go to each one and\nanswer the question.\n\n378\n00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.430\nYou gotta pick the hard drive to install.\n\n379\n00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:04.520\nIt's an inconvenience.\n\n380\n00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.800\nIt's not a showstopper, it doesn't end\nthe process, it's just an inconvenience.\n\n381\n00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:09.970\nAll right, so I'm gonna go and\n\n382\n00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.500\nhit Next on this thing, and\nnow I need to give it a name.\n\n383\n00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.560\nI've got NetRestore of Macintosh HD, and\n\n384\n00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.290\nI'm gonna rename that to\nsomething a little more useful.\n\n385\n00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:21.920\nSomething like NetRestore\nof Student Lab Machine or\n\n386\n00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.400\nAccounting computer, or whatever.\n\n387\n00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.740\nNow, every time we hire a new accountant,\nI can just throw this image on there,\n\n388\n00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.670\nand it's already got all their software,\n\n389\n00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.560\neverything they need all deployed,\nright on it.\n\n390\n00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.970\nI'll give it an image name,\nor an image number.\n\n391\n00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.070\nRemember if it's gonna be\nstored on more than one server,\n\n392\n00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:42.400\nwe need to pick an image number that is\nover 4,096, so I'll make this one 5,001.\n\n393\n00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.040\nThe one I did in the other show was 5,000.\n\n394\n00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.190\nAnd you've got this\nlittle option right here.\n\n395\n00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.940\nInclude OS X Recovery Partition.\n\n396\n00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.550\nBy default it's gonna create\nan image of the Macintosh HD.\n\n397\n00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:58.210\nIt's not gonna create an image of the\nrecovery partition and as long as we're\n\n398\n00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:00.660\ndeploying computers that already have\na recovery partition, that's fine.\n\n399\n00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.440\nRight?\nCuz there's no actual data in there.\n\n400\n00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.980\nIt's just the recovery.\n\n401\n00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.390\nWhat if the machines don't\nhave a recovery partition?\n\n402\n00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.750\nThen when we restore, we will be\nrestoring without a recovery partition.\n\n403\n00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:15.390\nIt will be up to you then to use internet\nrecovery if you ever need to do recovery\n\n404\n00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.290\non a machine.\n\n405\n00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.330\nI like to package it in,\nso that's an option.\n\n406\n00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:21.320\nIt adds about 800 megabytes\nto the size of the image.\n\n407\n00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.540\nSo it's not really signficant, but\nit does make the image bigger.\n\n408\n00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.320\nAll right, I'm going to hit next on that.\n\n409\n00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.170\nI can pick the hard ware\nthat I wanna support this.\n\n410\n00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:31.110\nNow I built this on a Mac Mini.\n\n411\n00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:33.290\nSo maybe I wanna turn off\nall this other stuff.\n\n412\n00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.470\nIf there was something\nspecial about that image.\n\n413\n00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:37.420\nIf I had some hardware driver or\nwhatever and\n\n414\n00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.590\nI wanted to hold it to a Mac Mini,\nI could.\n\n415\n00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:43.240\nBut usually these images will run\non pretty much any hardware, so\n\n416\n00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.820\nI'll go ahead and turn all these back on,\nso they can roll out that way.\n\n417\n00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.130\nAll right, we can do filtering.\n\n418\n00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:51.570\nSince this is a lab image, I probably\ndon't want to worry about the filtering,\n\n419\n00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.550\nbut if your software has\nlicensing restrictions on it.\n\n420\n00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.090\nYou probably don't want just anybody\nto be able to grab that image, so\n\n421\n00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.730\nyou could apply MAC address\nfiltering right here.\n\n422\n00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:59.560\nAnd that would take care of that.\n\n423\n00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.020\nAll right, that's all it needed.\n\n424\n00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.470\nNow it's gonna give it a name.\n\n425\n00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:08.440\nNow, the file is gonna be stored in\nNetBootSP0, just like NetInstall right?\n\n426\n00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.580\nSo it's on the hard drive that you chose,\nslash Library,\n\n427\n00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.280\nslash NetBoot, slash NetBootSP0, right.\n\n428\n00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.270\nThat's where it's gonna end up.\n\n429\n00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:20.970\nAnd it's just gonna be another NBI folder\nlike the NetInstall that we made earlier.\n\n430\n00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:22.180\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and save that.\n\n431\n00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:27.340\nI do need to be an administrator to\nperform that process, and here it goes.\n\n432\n00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.430\nWhat it's doing is,\nover the thunderbolt cable,\n\n433\n00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:34.470\nit's grabbing a copy of all\nthe data that's on that machine.\n\n434\n00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:36.570\nAnd writing it to that MBI folder.\n\n435\n00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:41.540\nSo if I browse to my storage drive,\nand I go into the net boot folder, and\n\n436\n00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.810\nnet boot SP0, I can come in here, and\n\n437\n00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:48.800\nI see NetRestore of\nStudent Lab Machine .nbi.\n\n438\n00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.370\nRight.\n\n439\n00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:52.330\nSo, if I browse in there,\nthere's the dmg that it is building.\n\n440\n00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:56.160\nJust like we built up here when\nwe did that other install.\n\n441\n00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.610\nAnd notice how I can see some of these\nother files that are appearing now.\n\n442\n00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:02.060\nThis is the boot loader for\nthat net install image.\n\n443\n00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.200\nI'll see boot loaders for\nthis image appear also, so\n\n444\n00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.220\nthat we'll be able to boot\noff it when it's done.\n\n445\n00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:10.130\nBut right now building,\nit got about 19 gigs of data to copy over.\n\n446\n00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:13.070\nAnd if I look at it right now\nit's copied a blazing 126 megs.\n\n447\n00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:17.040\nSo it gonna be a little while we might\nhave to use the magic of television here\n\n448\n00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.800\nto advance this one, but\n\n449\n00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.440\nits got to copy all the data from\nthat drive, over to my storage.\n\n450\n00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.540\nThe more data I have on that drive,\nthe longer this is gonna take.\n\n451\n00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.200\nSo it could take hours to build it.\n\n452\n00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:33.110\nThe El Capitan image I made in the last\nepisode, it built really fast.\n\n453\n00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:35.900\nIt built in under ten minutes,\nit did it live during the show.\n\n454\n00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.240\nAnd the reason is it's just\nthe installation image.\n\n455\n00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:42.110\nIt's a maximum of nine gigs in size,\nyou're not talking about a lot of data but\n\n456\n00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:45.830\nwhen you build a source machine you can\ninstall whatever you wanted on there.\n\n457\n00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.380\nYou could have gigs or\n\n458\n00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:51.570\neven terabytes of data on that machine and\nthat's gonna make the image bigger,\n\n459\n00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.939\nwhich means it'll take longer to make\nthe image and longer to deploy the image.\n\n460\n00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.800\nAll right well, let's wait for\na moment here while that install finishes.\n\n461\n00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.830\nThen we'll jump in and\ntake a look at that image and\n\n462\n00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.930\nwe'll get it added into our server.\n\n463\n00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:06.420\nIt should, actually, automatically appear,\nbut we'll verify that it shows up.\n\n464\n00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.120\nAnd then that will kind of wrap it up for\nnet restore.\n\n465\n00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.570\nAll right,\nlooks like we're all wrapped up there.\n\n466\n00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:12.070\nSo the image completed creation,\n\n467\n00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:14.820\nit built the image,\nit stored it onto my USB drive, now.\n\n468\n00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:18.490\nAnd so I get my nice little message here,\nletting me know image creation successful\n\n469\n00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:22.690\nand I'll just finish that up and it's\nalready added it right hereto my list.\n\n470\n00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:24.770\nI've got that\nNetrestore Student Lab Machine,\n\n471\n00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:29.800\nnow as far as the net install\nserver service is concerned.\n\n472\n00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.980\nIt doesn't really care if it's a net\ninstall or a net restore image.\n\n473\n00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.460\nThey're both copies of El Capitan.\n\n474\n00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.090\nThey're both able to be\ndeployed over the network.\n\n475\n00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:38.120\nThey're both MBIs.\n\n476\n00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.295\nThere really is no difference.\n\n477\n00:23:39.295 --> 00:23:41.575\nSo it treats them the same.\n\n478\n00:23:41.575 --> 00:23:45.495\nNow I know this first one is a clean\ninstall of El Capitan made from\n\n479\n00:23:45.495 --> 00:23:46.535\nthe installation image.\n\n480\n00:23:46.535 --> 00:23:50.515\nAnd I know that this one is\na NetRestore image that was made from\n\n481\n00:23:50.515 --> 00:23:52.852\nan actual source machine\nsitting Right here.\n\n482\n00:23:52.852 --> 00:23:56.243\nSo I know the difference but\nthe computer really doesnt it doesnt care.\n\n483\n00:23:56.243 --> 00:24:02.198\nAnd so, if I browse on my storage drive,\nand I go in and check out the nebu folder.\n\n484\n00:24:02.198 --> 00:24:03.917\nWhoops!\n\n485\n00:24:03.917 --> 00:24:05.693\nIf I try and check it out there we go.\n\n486\n00:24:05.693 --> 00:24:09.509\nI can see that Netinstall.dmg\nversus Netinstall.dmg.\n\n487\n00:24:09.509 --> 00:24:10.750\nSee how they're both called Netinstall?\n\n488\n00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:14.220\nEven though the bottom one\nis a NetRestore, right?\n\n489\n00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.590\nSo it really does treat the same.\n\n490\n00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:16.850\nThey've got their bootable files,\n\n491\n00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.380\nright here so\nthey'll be able to boot off the network.\n\n492\n00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.690\nAnd now they're in business.\n\n493\n00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:24.460\nOne thing I might want to change\nis notice how the NetInstall\n\n494\n00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.460\nof OS X El Capitan is\nset as my default image.\n\n495\n00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.980\nIf somebody boots holding the n\nkey on their keyboard right now,\n\n496\n00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.510\nthen they're gonna boot, and\nthey'll get regular old El Capitan.\n\n497\n00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:37.290\nIf I wanted to be\nthe Student Lab Machine instead\n\n498\n00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:41.070\nI just need to choose to use\nthat as the default boot image.\n\n499\n00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:45.250\nNow if somebody boots holding n,\nthey'll get this one instead, all right.\n\n500\n00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:45.940\nThat's important,\n\n501\n00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.690\nbecause that's what's gonna basically\ntell them which image to grab.\n\n502\n00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:53.040\nNow if I want people to be able to pick,\n\n503\n00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.960\nyou actually can't do it by\nholding n on the keyboard.\n\n504\n00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.880\nWhen you hold on n on the keyboard,\n\n505\n00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.190\nit always goes to the default image and\nthat's it.\n\n506\n00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:02.800\nIf you want to pick, that's where you\ngotta go and switch into the startup disk\n\n507\n00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.970\nutility, which I'm pretty sure that\nI can't see here from the server.\n\n508\n00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:05.910\nLet's just test that out.\n\n509\n00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:09.900\nSo if I go into my system preferences,\nand I go to start up disk,\n\n510\n00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:14.030\nI'll be able to see, not only my local\ndisks to put also networked disks.\n\n511\n00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:16.350\nSo I'm just gonna go into\nstartup disk here, and\n\n512\n00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:20.370\nwhen you go into the startup disks you\nalways see your own hard drive, right?\n\n513\n00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:25.500\nYour own bootable drive, but if you're on\na client that's kind of floating about on\n\n514\n00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:29.450\nthe network you'll see other icons appear\nhere for each of the net installer, net\n\n515\n00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:33.180\nrestore images, they'll show up and you'll\nbe able to pick them and boot to them.\n\n516\n00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:33.820\nAll right.\n\n517\n00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:37.070\nNow in my case, I'm the server, I guess I\ngot my client here that I could boot up,\n\n518\n00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.610\nit's still in target mode.\n\n519\n00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.400\nSo if I take that, and actually here,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n520\n00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.280\nreboot the other client so we can see it.\n\n521\n00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.170\nWe're gonna talk about\ndeployment in another episode,\n\n522\n00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.730\nbut I just wanted you guys to\nsee real quick how there's not\n\n523\n00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:49.450\nreally any difference\nbetween these two things.\n\n524\n00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:52.270\nSo I just wanna power that down and\nunhook this cable,\n\n525\n00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:56.060\nand we'll get that one fired back up and\nhear our happy Mac sound there.\n\n526\n00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.490\nAll right, so that one's gonna reboot and\ndo its thing.\n\n527\n00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:02.890\nNow on my side here on the server side,\nokay,\n\n528\n00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:05.750\nwhat if I need to make\nchanges to this stuff?\n\n529\n00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.810\nWhat if I want to come in and\nmodify these things?\n\n530\n00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:12.790\nWell technically, if I want to do\nsomething big like installing new\n\n531\n00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:16.600\nsoftware and changing the configuration\nsettings, then either I need to go to my\n\n532\n00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:22.410\nsource machine make the changes and\nrebuild this image, or modify this image.\n\n533\n00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:25.820\nBut I'm somewhat limited in what\nI can do in modifying this image.\n\n534\n00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.850\nIf we go to edit the image settings we\ncan highlight it, click the gear and\n\n535\n00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:31.530\nhit edit image settings, and\n\n536\n00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:35.330\nwhen we go in here we can see there's\nnot a whole heck of a lot of options.\n\n537\n00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:35.930\nRight?\n\n538\n00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:40.130\nI've got the image index number,\nI've got the restrictions, and that's it.\n\n539\n00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:42.530\nIt's very similar to that\nnet install over here, that,\n\n540\n00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.940\nif I edit that one,\nit's the same thing, right?\n\n541\n00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.720\nI only have a handful of options.\n\n542\n00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.880\nSo, not much that I can change, but\n\n543\n00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:54.390\nif I run the System Image utility, I can\nfire up the the System Image utility,\n\n544\n00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:58.100\nand we can go through and\npick a net restore source.\n\n545\n00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:03.640\nSo we can define that net restore source,\nand we can go and pick that image and\n\n546\n00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.560\nkind of go in and edit it.\n\n547\n00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.320\nBut really, the ideal way,\nwould be to take that source machine and\n\n548\n00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.090\nmake the changes there and\nrebuild the image.\n\n549\n00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:12.850\nSo that's kind of the way that\nwe'd really need to go about that.\n\n550\n00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:18.060\nThose netboot images, once they're created\nwe really shouldn't mess with them much.\n\n551\n00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.730\nAll right now my other\nlittle Mac here is booting.\n\n552\n00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:21.150\nSo let's switch over to that one.\n\n553\n00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.540\nI'm gonna jump over to my\nwireless keyboard here.\n\n554\n00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.250\nShoot.\n\n555\n00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.810\nI closed my laptop, so\nit's gonna go to sleep.\n\n556\n00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:29.600\nI need my laptop to stay awake,\nbecause it's the server, right.\n\n557\n00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.590\nSo there we go, it's awake again.\n\n558\n00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:33.740\nAnd I'm gonna need to make sure.\n\n559\n00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.400\nActually, I'm forgetting\nall sorts of things here.\n\n560\n00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.900\nSo, if you look at my server, some of you\nmight have noticed this big problem up\n\n561\n00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.510\nhere, which is I turned NetInstall off.\n\n562\n00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:41.610\nSo let me turn that back on.\n\n563\n00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:44.200\nSo I've got NetInstall on, it's on.\n\n564\n00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.980\nOn from my ethernet adapter right.\n\n565\n00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.140\nSo it's up, and\nit's servicing on the network.\n\n566\n00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:52.070\nNow I just need a client to connect and\nsee some action right.\n\n567\n00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:55.410\nIf I go to my connections tab I'll see\nthat nobody is connected right now.\n\n568\n00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:59.490\nI'll switch over to my other Mac and\non this one it's booting up.\n\n569\n00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.010\nThis one see I've got that\nARD account that we made.\n\n570\n00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:06.650\nI haven't really imaged this\nthing it's just sitting here and\n\n571\n00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:07.770\nits up and its running.\n\n572\n00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:13.520\nNow on this machine if I wanted to boot\nup and get to pick, I could have booted\n\n573\n00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:18.480\nit holding N on my keyboard and had I done\nthat, what was this thing asking me about?\n\n574\n00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.730\nShut down wasn't appropriate,\nI'm fine with that.\n\n575\n00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:24.240\nAll right, so if I booted holding n on\nmy keyboard, it would have just booted\n\n576\n00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.050\nthe default image which was that\nNetRestore for the lab machines, but\n\n577\n00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:33.210\nnow that I've got it fired up like this,\nI can go into my system preferences.\n\n578\n00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.250\nAnd I can go to these start\nup disk system preference and\n\n579\n00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:40.220\nonce I get into the start up disk\nsystem preference I'll be able to pick\n\n580\n00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.940\nfrom the different images\nthat are out there.\n\n581\n00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.420\nI'm going to go in here, and\nit's going to find my own hard drive.\n\n582\n00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:49.060\nSo there's Macintosh HD and\nsee how it paused for it moment, and\n\n583\n00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:53.750\nthen Net Install for El Capitan and\nNet Restore for lab machines.\n\n584\n00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:54.590\nThey show up.\n\n585\n00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.350\nIt found them on the network.\n\n586\n00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:57.970\nIt used Bonjour.\n\n587\n00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:01.730\nAnd if there were three\nnet install servers, and\n\n588\n00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:05.620\nI had this El Capitan image on all three,\nit wouldn't show up three times.\n\n589\n00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.370\nIt would show up once,\nbecause the index number\n\n590\n00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:12.870\nwould let me know that it was the same\nimage from three different servers, right?\n\n591\n00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:14.850\nVersus if they had different\nimage index numbers,\n\n592\n00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:16.920\nthen I would think that\nthey were different images.\n\n593\n00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.240\nBut I can come in, and I can pick\nI wanna do this clean install, or\n\n594\n00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.030\nI want to do the Netrestore, and we can\npick and now we'll be able to boot and\n\n595\n00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:25.730\nstart to use that.\n\n596\n00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:28.570\nNow, the screen is locked for\nme so I need to unlock it.\n\n597\n00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:32.290\nAnd let me provide my\nadministrative credentials, and\n\n598\n00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:35.570\nlet's say I do want to just go\nback to a fresh and clean install,\n\n599\n00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:41.010\nI can choose Netinstall So I've selected\na network Net Install of OS 10 El Capitan.\n\n600\n00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.220\nAnd if I can get my zoom under\ncontrol I can hit restart.\n\n601\n00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.330\nAnd now it's gonna reboot,\n\n602\n00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:50.350\nand it's just gonna warn me here\nam I sure I want to do that?\n\n603\n00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:51.740\nYeah I'm okay.\n\n604\n00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:52.420\nSo it's gonna reboot.\n\n605\n00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:56.130\nAnd instead of booting from\nthe internal hard drive.\n\n606\n00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.560\nInstead of booting from recovery,\ninstead of me holding N and\n\n607\n00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.170\nit installing the default,\nit's going to reach out to the server and\n\n608\n00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:05.880\nit's going to start\nthe installation of that one image.\n\n609\n00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:09.680\nAnd that process can be a little lengthy,\nso I'll show the start here.\n\n610\n00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.120\nYou guys know the end, the end is you\nhave a clean install of El Capitan.\n\n611\n00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.460\nThat's not terribly exciting.\n\n612\n00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.250\nBut it's gonna startup here, and\n\n613\n00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.090\nas soon as it does it's\ngonna boot from the network.\n\n614\n00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:19.890\nSo I should see the icons change.\n\n615\n00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:22.970\nNormally when you boot,\nyou expect to see the Apple logo, right.\n\n616\n00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:26.720\nBut here we'll actually see a little bit\nof a globe appear as it hits the network,\n\n617\n00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.800\nand then it will actually change to\nan apple at some point or another.\n\n618\n00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.310\nSo it's gonna run through that process,\nand\n\n619\n00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.300\nthen it'll start to boot\nwhat looks like recovery.\n\n620\n00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:37.880\nIt'll look like recovery, but\nit's actually gonna kick off that install.\n\n621\n00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.590\nAnd assuming that I answered everything\ncorrectly, assuming that I said install on\n\n622\n00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:45.570\na hard drive called Macintosh HD and that\nthere is a hard drive called Macintosh HD,\n\n623\n00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:50.260\nassuming that all that stuff happens,\nthen this should work out pretty well.\n\n624\n00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.115\nNow, how do I know if its working?\n\n625\n00:30:53.115 --> 00:30:55.070\nBecause when you boot it, you might\nsee a black screen, and actually,\n\n626\n00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:56.410\nthat's what I'm seeing\non my Mac right now.\n\n627\n00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:58.250\nIt's why it's not up,\nit's just a black screen.\n\n628\n00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:59.750\nWell, what's going on?\n\n629\n00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:03.590\nIn theory, it should be finding our\nserver, and if it finds the server,\n\n630\n00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:07.000\nit should then be grabbing\nthe bootable files for that image.\n\n631\n00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.010\nAnd those bootable files\ncan range in size, but\n\n632\n00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:10.140\nthey can take a little bit of time.\n\n633\n00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.970\nSo, depending on the speed\nof your network adapter,\n\n634\n00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.990\nit may take it a moment to grab those.\n\n635\n00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.030\nAnd if you want to monitor the progress,\n\n636\n00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:18.494\nyou can actually from\ninside of your server app.\n\n637\n00:31:18.494 --> 00:31:21.632\nSo like for me if I go into my server\napp and I go to connections and\n\n638\n00:31:21.632 --> 00:31:24.596\nI'll get not client is connected\nthat's not very fun, but\n\n639\n00:31:24.596 --> 00:31:27.931\nremember that the server app\ndoesn't always refresh its screen.\n\n640\n00:31:27.931 --> 00:31:33.035\nSo you might need to go up here to view\nand refresh or wherever there we go or\n\n641\n00:31:33.035 --> 00:31:39.660\ncommand R and let it refresh until you see\nyour client now I'm not seeing a client.\n\n642\n00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:41.070\nWhat does that mean?\n\n643\n00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:44.310\nWell the short answer to that is\nsomething is not working, right?\n\n644\n00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:47.860\nSo something is not working so\nwe've gotta find out why.\n\n645\n00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:50.377\nI know that my Mac was\nable to see the server,\n\n646\n00:31:50.377 --> 00:31:53.655\nbecause I was able to pick\nthe disk in the startup window.\n\n647\n00:31:53.655 --> 00:31:56.985\nRight so, what's more than likely\nhappening is it's rebooting, and\n\n648\n00:31:56.985 --> 00:31:58.594\nit's trying to go into recovery,\n\n649\n00:31:58.594 --> 00:32:02.150\nand this system might actually\nhave a damaged recovery partition.\n\n650\n00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:04.951\nIt might not even have a recovery\npartition at all In which case it's gonna\n\n651\n00:32:04.951 --> 00:32:06.499\nhave a hard time booting from that disk.\n\n652\n00:32:06.499 --> 00:32:09.616\nSo if you ever bump into this where it\ngoes to boot and it doesn't quite work,\n\n653\n00:32:09.616 --> 00:32:11.090\nthen it might be missing recovery.\n\n654\n00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:15.060\nAnd the easiest way to get around that is\nto either boot from Internet recovery or\n\n655\n00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:16.920\nto boot from a USB key.\n\n656\n00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.530\nAnd you can boot from the USB key and go.\n\n657\n00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:20.990\nBut actually it looks like\nit's getting over it.\n\n658\n00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:22.540\nSometimes you just have to be patient.\n\n659\n00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.580\nI know I get really impatient sometimes,\nso sometimes you just have to wait.\n\n660\n00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.401\nThe boot is gonna take longer because\nit's booting over the network.\n\n661\n00:32:29.401 --> 00:32:32.940\nAnd if I remember right, I believe\nthis is just 100 megabit network.\n\n662\n00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:36.860\nEven though I have a gigabit adapter\nis actually only 100 megabit.\n\n663\n00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.470\nSo it has to download the boot files,\n\n664\n00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:41.420\nwhich I believe are about\n300 megs in size.\n\n665\n00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.540\nSo it's gotta download\nabout 300 megs of data.\n\n666\n00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.590\nThen it's gonna start to boot that.\n\n667\n00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:48.170\nThen it's gotta reach out and\nstart to get the rest of it.\n\n668\n00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:49.230\nAnd this image.\n\n669\n00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:50.810\nYou know I probably should\nhave paid attention to that.\n\n670\n00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:53.260\nI think it was about 9 gigs in size.\n\n671\n00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.150\nLet me find out here real quick.\n\n672\n00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:59.995\nSo if I go to my hard drive and\nI find that installation image,\n\n673\n00:32:59.995 --> 00:33:02.281\nit is 6.39 gigs in size.\n\n674\n00:33:02.281 --> 00:33:05.550\nSo it's gonna have to copy about 6.5\ngigs of data for this to finish.\n\n675\n00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:10.290\nThe boot files themselves are considerably\nsmaller and so it's not as much\n\n676\n00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:13.340\nthat it has to copy over and\nwe can actually find out how big they are.\n\n677\n00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.900\nActually 22 megs, that's pretty small,\nsmaller than I thought it was.\n\n678\n00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.830\nSo that should be moving along and\nactually, if we look at my Mac,\n\n679\n00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:21.460\nit is actually responding now.\n\n680\n00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:22.430\nThere we go.\n\n681\n00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.880\nSo it's booting and see the little globe?\n\n682\n00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.360\nThat little globe, instead of an apple,\n\n683\n00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.470\nthat's what lets me know it's\nbooting from the network.\n\n684\n00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:31.380\nAnd it's looking for that server,\nit's looking to find the image so\n\n685\n00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.310\nthat it can go and do the install.\n\n686\n00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:37.460\nNow, had I just booted holding the N key,\nthen this would just go and\n\n687\n00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.410\ninstall whatever the default\nimage was on the server.\n\n688\n00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:43.570\nBut because we chose it\nfrom the startup disk,\n\n689\n00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:47.100\nit's gonna boot, connect to the server,\ngrab the image that I want, and\n\n690\n00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.930\nperform the install, and\nnow we just have to wait.\n\n691\n00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:51.760\nNow, it will eventually\nchange to an apple.\n\n692\n00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.840\nYou get a little status bar,\n\n693\n00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:56.350\nyou'll see the recovery screen briefly\nas it starts to do its installation.\n\n694\n00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:59.430\nSo it is gonna run through a few different\nthings as it moves through that process,\n\n695\n00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:02.620\nbut when it's all said and\ndone, you're gonna be up and\n\n696\n00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:06.910\nrunning and it'll be a clean\ninstall of OSX El Capitan.\n\n697\n00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:08.020\n>> Don, it's interesting.\n\n698\n00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.811\nAs computers get faster,\nthe faster they get, well,\n\n699\n00:34:10.811 --> 00:34:12.640\nthe more impatient we get for sure.\n\n700\n00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.850\nWe've been looking at deployment\nsolutions and specifically NetRestore.\n\n701\n00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.430\nAnd Don, it does look like we're\ncoming to the end of another episode.\n\n702\n00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:20.550\nBut before we go,\ndo you got anything else?\n\n703\n00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:21.748\nThat's about it for this one.\n\n704\n00:34:21.748 --> 00:34:25.370\nI do wanna show you guys actually\nhaving that image restore in place.\n\n705\n00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:26.460\nBut I know what kind of out of time.\n\n706\n00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.410\nIt would just take a long time.\n\n707\n00:34:28.410 --> 00:34:31.220\nKeep in mind, NetInstall,\nNetRestore, NetBoot.\n\n708\n00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:32.300\nAll three of them.\n\n709\n00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.430\nThey really work the same as\nfar as the deployment side.\n\n710\n00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:38.470\nThe only real difference is isn't\nin the creation of it, right?\n\n711\n00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:41.160\nSo when you create those images,\nwe gotta make sure\n\n712\n00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.480\nthe System Image Utility is set to\ncreate the image type that we want.\n\n713\n00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.160\nOnce they're in place,\nthey all kind of deploy the same.\n\n714\n00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.470\nWith the exception of NetBoot I guess,\n\n715\n00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:51.470\ncuz NetBoot doesn't install to the hard\ndrive like NetInstall and NetRestore do.\n\n716\n00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:53.230\n>> Well Don, we thank you for\nthat information.\n\n717\n00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:54.600\nWe thank you the viewer for watching.\n\n718\n00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.620\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign out at ITProTV.\n\n719\n00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.110\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n720\n00:34:58.110 --> 00:34:59.010\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n721\n00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:01.331\n>> And we'll see you

00:00:16.040\nI'm your host, Wes Bryant, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.500\ntoday's episode we are continuing through\nour Mac OS X Server Essentials series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.240\nAnd specifically we are looking\nat deployment solutions today.\n\n6\n00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.370\nAnd we're gonna be focusing\nin on image deployment.\n\n7\n00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.840\nTo help us out with that topic\nis none other than Mr Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.080\nDon, how are you doing today sir?\n\n9\n00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.760\n>> I'm doing great,\n\n10\n00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.730\nWes, ready to dive right back in\nto the world of deploying OS X.\n\n11\n00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.100\nAnd we filmed a couple of\nepisodes prior to this,\n\n12\n00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.680\nyou've probably watched at this point.\n\n13\n00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.640\nWe covered NetInstall images and\nwe covered NetRestore images.\n\n14\n00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.550\nAnd we talked a bit about NetBoot but\nNetBoot's really not that commonly used.\n\n15\n00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.720\nSo we got a really good chance to see\nhow to create all three image types.\n\n16\n00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.510\nWe set up a NetInstall Server,\nwe loaded our images on there.\n\n17\n00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.190\nAnd we did everything we needed\nto set up that infrastructure and\n\n18\n00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.760\non the exam,\nthat's really what they want you to know.\n\n19\n00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.120\nSo if you're just looking\nto pass the exam,\n\n20\n00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.220\nyou kind of learn what you need to know.\n\n21\n00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.750\nBut you're gonna take that knowledge out\nof the real world and actually apply it.\n\n22\n00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.450\nAnd one of things that we haven't\nseen is actually deploying the image,\n\n23\n00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.260\nputting it out onto those machines.\n\n24\n00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.280\nSo we've done all this work to\ncreate an infrastructure and\n\n25\n00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.500\nwe haven't actually used it.\n\n26\n00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.100\nAnd so in this episode, I wanna show you\nguys how we can deploy these images.\n\n27\n00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.660\nHow we can put them out there\ninto the real world and\n\n28\n00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.040\nget them laid out onto our\nMacs out in the field.\n\n29\n00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.100\nNow if you're setting up NetInstall,\nor NetBoot, or\n\n30\n00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.910\nNetRestore, the way you build\nthe image is different.\n\n31\n00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.160\nBut the way you deploy it is the same.\n\n32\n00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.680\nSo what we're about to see is really\nthe same regardless of the three different\n\n33\n00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.010\ntypes of images that we can build.\n\n34\n00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.028\nOnce the images are on\nthe NetInstall Server,\n\n35\n00:01:44.028 --> 00:01:45.745\nthey're all kind of treated equally.\n\n36\n00:01:45.745 --> 00:01:49.331\nAnd there's not really much difference\nfrom there aside from user data with\n\n37\n00:01:49.331 --> 00:01:49.845\nNetBoot.\n\n38\n00:01:49.845 --> 00:01:53.645\n>> Now Don, in the previous episode we did\nsee you creating images with NetInstall\n\n39\n00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:54.507\nand NetRestore.\n\n40\n00:01:54.507 --> 00:01:58.211\nAnd NetRestore I believe was the one\nwhere I could package the customized\n\n41\n00:01:58.211 --> 00:01:59.320\napplications.\n\n42\n00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.600\nWhich one are we gonna be deploying?\n\n43\n00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.170\n>> We actually had choices, so let's kind\nof recap what we did in the other episode.\n\n44\n00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.680\nSo I've been using my laptop as\nthe server and I've set up two images.\n\n45\n00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.670\nAnd the first image that we built\nwas just a straight up NetInstall\n\n46\n00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.100\nof OS 10 El Capitan.\n\n47\n00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.200\nSo in that episode I took\nthe El Capitan installer and\n\n48\n00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.900\nconverted it into a NetInstall image.\n\n49\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.680\nSo if we look at my server app,\nwhen I go in here,\n\n50\n00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.310\nunder my images I've got the NetInstall\nof OS 10 El Capitan sitting right there.\n\n51\n00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.834\nSo that's just a straight up\nNetInstall image, all right?\n\n52\n00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:35.770\nThen in the next episode we\nbuilt a NetRestore image.\n\n53\n00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.100\nI took my Mac Mini over here to the side.\n\n54\n00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.400\nI installed,\nwhat do they install in it, Chrome.\n\n55\n00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.190\nRight, Google Chrome,\nI changed some icons around.\n\n56\n00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.820\nI created an Apple remote\ndesktop user account,\n\n57\n00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.990\nI made customizations to the machines.\n\n58\n00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.940\nAnd then I mounted it to my\ncomputer using target mode and\n\n59\n00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.030\nI created an image of its disk.\n\n60\n00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.780\nAnd that image became the NetRestore\nimage of the Student Lab Machine.\n\n61\n00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.380\nAnd so I've got that one here too, right?\n\n62\n00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.960\nThey're both loaded,\nthey're both on my server.\n\n63\n00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.490\nAnd remember for these images,\n\n64\n00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.710\nif you want them to show up on your server\nthey've gotta go in a particular place.\n\n65\n00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.698\nSo when I browse that hard drive,\n\n66\n00:03:10.698 --> 00:03:15.405\nit's inside of /Library/NetBoot/netBootSP.\n\n67\n00:03:15.405 --> 00:03:19.130\nAnd then right in here,\nwe can see those two images that I've got.\n\n68\n00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.540\nAnd once they're on the server,\nthe server treats them as equal.\n\n69\n00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.610\nSo see how they're both just .nbi,\nnbi is NetBoot image.\n\n70\n00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.450\nSo really it's treating them both as\n\n71\n00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.260\nNetBoot even though they're\nactually NetInstall or NetRestore.\n\n72\n00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.660\nThe server really doesn't\ncare beyond this point.\n\n73\n00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.340\nThe image is what makes the difference,\nwhat's inside of it.\n\n74\n00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.890\nAnd really if we look at that,\n\n75\n00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.130\nthey're mostly just made up of a disk\nimage coupled with all their boot files.\n\n76\n00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.810\nRight, so at this point they're\nreally all treated the same.\n\n77\n00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.740\nSo Wes asked which one\nare we gonna deploy?\n\n78\n00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.420\nWell, we've kind of got a choice.\n\n79\n00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.390\nNow, when it comes to deploying\nan image there's two ways to do it.\n\n80\n00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.240\nWell, there's actually\nseveral different ways, but\n\n81\n00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.002\nthere's two ways that\nwe really care about.\n\n82\n00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.150\nWe wanna be able to deploy\nthis over the network.\n\n83\n00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.690\nAnd when you deploy it over the network,\nyou've got a choice.\n\n84\n00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.090\nYou've got one method which is\nreally streamlined, quick and easy.\n\n85\n00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.220\nAnd that is you can power on your Mac\n\n86\n00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.190\nwhile holding the End\nkey on your keyboard.\n\n87\n00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.140\nAnd when you do that,\nthat tells your Mac to do a network boot.\n\n88\n00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.530\nIt tells it to look on the network and\nfind a NetInstall Server and\n\n89\n00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.750\nboot whatever is the default image.\n\n90\n00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.890\nNotice that I've got two images here and\n\n91\n00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.340\nthis one NetRestore of Student Lab Machine\nsays it's in a default.\n\n92\n00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.480\nSo any Mac on the network\nthat boots right now,\n\n93\n00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.010\nif you hold the End key and\nit's gonna boot.\n\n94\n00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.065\nIt's gonna hit this NetRestore image and\nassuming that I've made it automated.\n\n95\n00:04:37.065 --> 00:04:40.449\nIt's gonna [INAUDIBLE] up that machine and\nit's gonna install this.\n\n96\n00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.530\nIt could potentially be bad, right?\n\n97\n00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.520\nIf I didn't make it automated,\nyou'd have a chance to cancel out, right,\n\n98\n00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.640\nif I didn't specify what\nhard drive to install to.\n\n99\n00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.940\nBut if I remember,\nwe did make that one automated.\n\n100\n00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.830\nSo it would just install and\nthat would be the end of it.\n\n101\n00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.430\nSo, holding End on the keyboard\ndoesn't give you any choices.\n\n102\n00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.670\nYou don't get to pick\nwhich image you deploy,\n\n103\n00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.800\nyou're gonna deploy\nwhatever is the default.\n\n104\n00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.020\nAnd you can easily change that.\n\n105\n00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.910\nI can pick the El Capitan image and\nI can come in here and\n\n106\n00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.970\nsay use as the default image and\nnow that one's the default.\n\n107\n00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.020\nSo if somebody boots holding End, they're\ngonna boot up and what are they gonna get?\n\n108\n00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.504\nThey're gonna get a nice\nclean install of El Capitan.\n\n109\n00:05:17.504 --> 00:05:18.960\nAnd that's kind of what I want for\n\n110\n00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.500\nthis Mac over here to my left anyway\nbecause well, I've customized it, right?\n\n111\n00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.420\nI made some changes to it and\nI want those changes to go away.\n\n112\n00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.537\nSo if I wanna put it back to normal,\nI now have this default install, right?\n\n113\n00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.740\nBut what if I wanna pick?\n\n114\n00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.565\nWhat if I've got 20 different images?\n\n115\n00:05:34.565 --> 00:05:38.265\nI've got images for accounting computers\nand images for sales computers.\n\n116\n00:05:38.265 --> 00:05:41.205\nI've got teacher computers and\nstudent computers or\n\n117\n00:05:41.205 --> 00:05:44.345\nI've got student desktops and\nstudent laptops.\n\n118\n00:05:44.345 --> 00:05:46.353\nYou might have many,\nmany different images.\n\n119\n00:05:46.353 --> 00:05:49.850\nAnd you wanna pick the image\nthat's appropriate for\n\n120\n00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.028\nthat particular user or whatever.\n\n121\n00:05:52.028 --> 00:05:54.240\nWell, holding End on the keyboard\ndoesn't give you a choice, so\n\n122\n00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.650\nyou don't have that option.\n\n123\n00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.060\nInstead, what you have to do is\nyou have to take your Mac and\n\n124\n00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.570\nyou have to boot it up into Mac OS.\n\n125\n00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.510\nYou actually have to have\na functioning operating system.\n\n126\n00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.720\nOnce you boot into Mac OS,\n\n127\n00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.930\nyou can use the startup disk\npreference to go in there and pick it.\n\n128\n00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.040\nLet me show you,\nlet's jump over to my Mac Mini over here.\n\n129\n00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.270\nAnd the Mac Mini, this is the one\nthat we customized in and so you can\n\n130\n00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.510\nsee where I've got that ARD account\nsitting right there on the desktop.\n\n131\n00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.960\nAnd if I go in and log in, I\n\n132\n00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.470\napologize now it's gonna be kind of small\ncuz the resolution's automatically set.\n\n133\n00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.060\nIt'll get a little\nbigger here in a second.\n\n134\n00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.180\nBut once I get logged in, it's\na functional version of El Capitan, right?\n\n135\n00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.590\nIt's being customized a little bit.\n\n136\n00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.190\nApparently, it's going to\nbe super slow for us today.\n\n137\n00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.120\nBut it's been customized a little bit, you\ncan see where I installed Google Chrome\n\n138\n00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.810\nright there and\nwe created that ARD account.\n\n139\n00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:50.770\nSo I wanna wipe it and just put it\nback to stock El Capitan, all right?\n\n140\n00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.060\nSo I can go up to my\nSystem Preferences and\n\n141\n00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.200\nin my System Preferences,\nI can go to these Startup Disk Preference.\n\n142\n00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.480\nAnd in the Startup Disk Preference,\n\n143\n00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.530\nI'll see my local disks that\nI can do it from, right?\n\n144\n00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.750\nThat's the normal thing is\nyou see those local disk.\n\n145\n00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.240\nBut I'll also be able to see\nall the NetInstall images and\n\n146\n00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.310\nnot just NetInstall\nimages from one server.\n\n147\n00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.200\nI'll see NetInstall images\nfrom all of my servers.\n\n148\n00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.860\nAnd, did I miss, oop, no,\nI'm being impatient today, I guess.\n\n149\n00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.590\nIt's insanely long, but anyhow.\n\n150\n00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.140\nSo I'm gonna go here to\nmy startup disk and now,\n\n151\n00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.490\nwhat it's gonna do is finish\nshowing my local disk.\n\n152\n00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.210\nAnd I see that Macintosh HD,\nthat's what I'm booted off of right now.\n\n153\n00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.708\nAnd now I also see these other images,\nokay.\n\n154\n00:07:33.708 --> 00:07:37.740\nNow I'm gonna unlock this real quick\ncuz you need to be an administrator for\n\n155\n00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.350\nthis to work, there we go.\n\n156\n00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.580\nAnd I'm seeing each of these if I float my\nmouse over, it gives me details, right?\n\n157\n00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.980\nWhat server did I learn about this\nimage from and what exactly is it?\n\n158\n00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.850\nThis one is installing OS X.\n\n159\n00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.290\nWell, this one is OS X also, right?\n\n160\n00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:53.750\nNot a big difference there.\n\n161\n00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.711\nBut one of them is a true install.\n\n162\n00:07:55.711 --> 00:07:59.119\nSee how it says System: Install OS X.\n\n163\n00:07:59.119 --> 00:08:02.630\nAnd then over here it\nsays System: Just OS 10.\n\n164\n00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.020\nIt doesn't say install.\n\n165\n00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.733\nAnd that's because this one is a\nNetRestore image and the NetRestore image,\n\n166\n00:08:07.733 --> 00:08:11.220\ntechnically OS ten has already\nbeen installed and we cloned it.\n\n167\n00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.720\nAnd so now we're going to deploy it\nin the form that it is right now.\n\n168\n00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.020\nIt's not a true install,\nversus this one that is a true install.\n\n169\n00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.180\nThat's how we can tell the difference and\nyou can see the icons are different.\n\n170\n00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.270\nSee that green arrow pointing down?\n\n171\n00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.270\nThat lets me know that\nthis is an installer.\n\n172\n00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.580\nThis is the native El Capitan installer.\n\n173\n00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.860\nVersus this one that has\nthe little network globe,\n\n174\n00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.950\nthat lets me know that is net\nrestore image of another machine.\n\n175\n00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:35.950\n>> Now Don in a scenario where maybe we\ndo have a thousand computers, we work for\n\n176\n00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:36.950\nmaybe a library.\n\n177\n00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.190\nAnd you've seen the custom image\nthat you've created with net restore\n\n178\n00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.950\nit's got Chrome.\n\n179\n00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.590\nMaybe I've got 50 of those machines\nthat I want to reprovision but\n\n180\n00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.030\nthey're not gonna be\nin my company anymore.\n\n181\n00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.320\nAnd this would be a way of giving me\nan option to actually select which image\n\n182\n00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.000\nI pick.\n\n183\n00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.740\n>> Exactly, yep.\nAnd it does require you to have a valid,\n\n184\n00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.270\nrunning operating system, right?\n\n185\n00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.430\nBecause otherwise you can't get\nto that startup disk utility.\n\n186\n00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.620\nWell, I guess you could boot to\nrecovery and do it from there.\n\n187\n00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.800\nIn recovery you can access\nthe startup disk menu also.\n\n188\n00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.160\nAnother way is,\n\n189\n00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.740\nif you don't have a bootable operating\nsystem, you could create a USB key.\n\n190\n00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:11.400\nYou know like an El Capitan installer and\nyou can boot off the USB key and\n\n191\n00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.722\ngo into the startup disk options and\nkinda go that way too.\n\n192\n00:09:13.722 --> 00:09:16.780\nThere is a few different ways you\ncould go about getting into this but\n\n193\n00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.550\nonce you're here you can pick\nfrom all of the different images.\n\n194\n00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.910\nNow, I want to point out one more thing\nabout this list before I move on from it.\n\n195\n00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:26.490\nThe list as we see it here, so if we\nlook at the list on my little Mac Mini.\n\n196\n00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:31.340\nIt's telling me the IP address of\nthe server that I viewed that image on.\n\n197\n00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.800\nOkay, this is important because\nI might see the same image\n\n198\n00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.400\nfrom more than one server, all right.\n\n199\n00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.000\nBy default, it's gonna assume\nthat every image is different.\n\n200\n00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.515\nBut if I have the same image\nstored on more than one server.\n\n201\n00:09:46.515 --> 00:09:50.772\nRemember that when we add the image to\na server, we have to set an image ID, and\n\n202\n00:09:50.772 --> 00:09:52.948\nthat image ID, it's an index number.\n\n203\n00:09:52.948 --> 00:09:59.265\nAnd the image index number,\nif it's 1 through 4,094, 4,095.\n\n204\n00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.275\n>> 96.\n\n205\n00:10:00.275 --> 00:10:05.244\n>> So it's 1 through 4,095,\nit's a unique image, all by itself.\n\n206\n00:10:05.244 --> 00:10:08.900\nBut if it's 4096 or higher, like Wes said.\n\n207\n00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:09.930\nAnything above 4096,\n\n208\n00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:15.190\nthat means that it is an image being\nstored on more than one server.\n\n209\n00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:18.680\nSo when I created the install,\nthis one right here.\n\n210\n00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:24.057\nI gave it an index number of 5000 and\nI gave this one an index number of 5001.\n\n211\n00:10:24.057 --> 00:10:26.878\nI can store those on\nfive different servers.\n\n212\n00:10:26.878 --> 00:10:29.925\nAnd as long as the index number\nwas the same on each one,\n\n213\n00:10:29.925 --> 00:10:32.750\nthe image would only show up once here.\n\n214\n00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.275\nAnd when I clicked on it like this or\nfloated over where it shows the server and\n\n215\n00:10:36.275 --> 00:10:39.043\nthe IP address it would actually\nhave more than one server.\n\n216\n00:10:39.043 --> 00:10:41.702\nIt would identify that we could actually\npull this image from more than one server.\n\n217\n00:10:41.702 --> 00:10:44.930\nAnd it'll give us some basic load\nbalancing, which is pretty useful.\n\n218\n00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.060\nSo as long as your index numbers are setup\nright, you won't see duplicate images.\n\n219\n00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.610\nIf you see duplicate images, that means\nthat you set some bad index numbers.\n\n220\n00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:55.820\n>> Now under the hood Don when it\ndoes pick the Netinstall image.\n\n221\n00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:56.790\nIs it doing a rock, paper,\n\n222\n00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.590\nscissors to figure out which server\nit's actually gonna pull it off of?\n\n223\n00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:00.318\n>> Sort of, yeah.\n\n224\n00:11:00.318 --> 00:11:02.390\n[LAUGH] It's up to Bonjour.\n\n225\n00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.575\nBonjour has some light load\nbalancing built into it.\n\n226\n00:11:04.575 --> 00:11:08.280\nIt does some basic testing there, it's\nnot perfect load balancing by any means.\n\n227\n00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.410\nBut it does try and\ndistribute the load across the systems,\n\n228\n00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:11.890\nand get that balance in place there.\n\n229\n00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:14.670\nBut, it's somewhat round robin,\nit's somewhat random.\n\n230\n00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.290\nIt's not an exact science on that one.\n\n231\n00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.120\nAlright, now remember if you screwed up\nyour index numbers, that's not a big deal.\n\n232\n00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.250\nYou can always fix it.\n\n233\n00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.295\nSo if you jump back over to my server,\non the server,\n\n234\n00:11:24.295 --> 00:11:26.457\nwhen I had my image lists right here.\n\n235\n00:11:26.457 --> 00:11:29.240\nI can come in and take one,\nso maybe my installer,\n\n236\n00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.310\nmaybe I gave it a wrong index number.\n\n237\n00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.360\nSo now I'm seeing three\ndifferent installers even though\n\n238\n00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.100\nthey're all the same.\n\n239\n00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.890\nYou can come in and\nyou can edit the image settings and\n\n240\n00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.970\nin the image settings you\ncan change the index number.\n\n241\n00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.156\nAnd if we go to edit that,\nyou can specify the alternate number.\n\n242\n00:11:43.156 --> 00:11:47.106\nJust remember and I think if I log out\ndo I get a tool tip that shows me.\n\n243\n00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:50.370\nOn the other screen you get\na tool tip which is kind of nice.\n\n244\n00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:55.100\nBut you basically need to make sure that\nyou set that, so that it's 4096 or higher.\n\n245\n00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.440\nI've kind of gotten in the habit of always\nusing numbers that are over 5,000 but\n\n246\n00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.790\nyou certainly don't have to.\n\n247\n00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.320\nIt just kind of saves you trouble\nlater on if you add another server.\n\n248\n00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:10.520\nAll right, so back on my Mac Mini\nit's seeing the different installs.\n\n249\n00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:15.100\nI can see the El Capitan installer,\nand I've got it selected, right?\n\n250\n00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.420\nAnd so now, when I reboot this\nsystem it's gonna boot up.\n\n251\n00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:23.040\nAnd it's gonna boot to that, whether it's\nset as the default on the server or not.\n\n252\n00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.860\nThis is kind of a nice thing here because\nwe don't care about what the default is,\n\n253\n00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.120\nwe just choose the disk and\nwe hit restart.\n\n254\n00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.216\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nhit restart and what should happen.\n\n255\n00:12:31.216 --> 00:12:35.049\nI'm gonna say should because in IT, we've\nalways got some levels of uncertainty.\n\n256\n00:12:35.049 --> 00:12:36.582\nIs that it's gonna boot up.\n\n257\n00:12:36.582 --> 00:12:40.430\nAnd instead of the Apple logo\nthat I normally see It's gonna be\n\n258\n00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:42.030\na little different.\n\n259\n00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.570\nI'm gonna see a globe,\nwell assuming it works.\n\n260\n00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.510\nI'm gonna see a little spinning globe.\n\n261\n00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:50.380\nAnd the spinning globe lets me know\nthat I'm booting off of the network and\n\n262\n00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.890\nnot booting off of my own hard drive.\n\n263\n00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.390\nAnd as soon as that globe clears,\nit means that I've found the server and\n\n264\n00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.110\nthat I'm ready to boot.\n\n265\n00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:01.210\nAnd as soon as the globe clears I'll\nsee the regular apple appear again, and\n\n266\n00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:02.430\nI'll see the progress bar.\n\n267\n00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:03.740\nSo right there, there we go.\n\n268\n00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.930\nSo I've got the Apple showing up on the\nscreen, and there was the globe beneath\n\n269\n00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:11.300\nit, so I know I'm booting off the network,\nand now I get the progress bar.\n\n270\n00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.420\nAnd the progress bar is gonna\nmove slower than normal.\n\n271\n00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.210\nNormally it moves by\nfairly quickly because\n\n272\n00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:17.280\nyou're booting off your own hard drive.\n\n273\n00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.800\nThis is gonna take longer because\nnow I'm booting off of the network.\n\n274\n00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.540\nRight.\n\n275\n00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:26.660\nWhen that little globe appeared it was\ndownloading a copy of my boot files.\n\n276\n00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.380\nAnd, on my other machine,\nI can look at those boot files,\n\n277\n00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.340\nthe boot files are really about 30 megs.\n\n278\n00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.180\nI think we saw them in another episode.\n\n279\n00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.830\nSo a quick download of about 30 megs,\nnot a big deal.\n\n280\n00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.890\nThen it gets to this point where it's\nready to kick in with the installer, and\n\n281\n00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.980\nnow it's gotta transfer\nsomething far bigger.\n\n282\n00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.580\nIt's basically creating a recovery\nenvironment to boot off of and\n\n283\n00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.790\nperform the install.\n\n284\n00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:50.125\nAnd the recovery environment is anywhere\nbetween 600 and 800 megs of data.\n\n285\n00:13:50.125 --> 00:13:51.825\nSo it's gonna transfer that.\n\n286\n00:13:51.825 --> 00:13:55.275\nAnd then as soon as that's done, it can\nboot up into a full recovery screen and\n\n287\n00:13:55.275 --> 00:13:56.055\nbegin the install.\n\n288\n00:13:56.055 --> 00:13:59.035\nAnd that's when it downloads\nthe whole rest of the image.\n\n289\n00:13:59.035 --> 00:14:03.780\nNow your image might be very small,\nit might be very large, right?\n\n290\n00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.720\nHow big is my net install of El Capitan?\n\n291\n00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.530\nLet's go and find out.\n\n292\n00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:12.002\nSo my net install of El Capitan\nis a blazing 6.9 gigs.\n\n293\n00:14:12.002 --> 00:14:15.090\n6.3 gigs, so not too terribly large there.\n\n294\n00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:19.750\nBut that means that I've gotta transfer\n6 gigabytes of data over the network\n\n295\n00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:20.730\nto do this install.\n\n296\n00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.790\n6.39 gigs to be exact, right?\n\n297\n00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.360\nBut if I do my other image,\n\n298\n00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:30.180\nthat NetRestore image,\nmy NetRestore image is 10.9 gigs.\n\n299\n00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.060\nAnd depending on how much software and\n\n300\n00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.950\nother things you install as part of that\nimage, your image could be 200 gigs.\n\n301\n00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:41.870\nSo, the longer the file is, the more data\nthere is, the longer it's gonna take for\n\n302\n00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:42.670\nyou to do the install.\n\n303\n00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:43.540\nAll right?\n\n304\n00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.290\nSo we'll jump back over\nto little Mac Mini.\n\n305\n00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.070\nWe'll see that it's progressing, right?\n\n306\n00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.380\nThat little bar crawling along.\n\n307\n00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.720\nBut we are going to have some waits here.\n\n308\n00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.370\nNow it's not transferring\nthe whole image right here.\n\n309\n00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.680\nSo if you have a 200 gig image,\nit's not transferring 200 gigs here.\n\n310\n00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.640\nIt's transferring\nthe recovery environment.\n\n311\n00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.995\nAnd the recovery environment\nis not usually very big.\n\n312\n00:15:02.995 --> 00:15:05.335\nLike I said 600 to 800 megs of data.\n\n313\n00:15:05.335 --> 00:15:08.185\nNow, I've got a,\nI think I'm on a gig network here.\n\n314\n00:15:08.185 --> 00:15:10.835\nSo I should be moving\nalong fairly quick and\n\n315\n00:15:10.835 --> 00:15:13.185\nwhen it's done we'll see\nit boot to recovery.\n\n316\n00:15:13.185 --> 00:15:17.395\nAnd assuming we made\nthe image fully automated,\n\n317\n00:15:17.395 --> 00:15:18.905\nwe shouldn't have to press anything.\n\n318\n00:15:18.905 --> 00:15:20.175\nRight.\nNow how do we make an image\n\n319\n00:15:20.175 --> 00:15:21.225\nfully automated?\n\n320\n00:15:21.225 --> 00:15:24.770\nWell when I made the images, if you go\nback and watch those earlier episodes.\n\n321\n00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:30.360\nThere was one screen where it asked me\nto pick the hard drive to install to and\n\n322\n00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.370\nI told it MacIntosh HD.\n\n323\n00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:36.630\nOkay, that's the one screen that\ndetermines whether automatic or not.\n\n324\n00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.550\nAll right, and I put in Macintosh HD.\n\n325\n00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:41.670\nThis Mac Mini has a hard\ndrive called Macintosh HD.\n\n326\n00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:45.650\nAnd as a result, it's gonna install\non that, it'll be fully automated.\n\n327\n00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.367\nSo I shouldn't have to give it anything.\n\n328\n00:15:47.367 --> 00:15:52.345\nIt should just run through its install and\nwhen it's done, we end up with El Capitan.\n\n329\n00:15:52.345 --> 00:15:55.740\nNow, Is it gonna be a clean install or\nan upgrade?\n\n330\n00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.550\nThat depends on whether I check\nthe box to format the hard drive and\n\n331\n00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:00.300\nif I remember, I think I did check that.\n\n332\n00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.206\nSo it's gonna format the hard drive and\nwe end up with a clean install.\n\n333\n00:16:03.206 --> 00:16:06.790\n>> So Don, as this images that\nyou create get bigger and bigger,\n\n334\n00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.080\nyou said 200 gigs as an example here.\n\n335\n00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.195\nYou really have to plan for\n\n336\n00:16:10.195 --> 00:16:13.243\nyour deployment because if we're\njust talking one, maybe not so bad.\n\n337\n00:16:13.243 --> 00:16:16.362\nBut if you're talking about 100,\n500, and God only knows,\n\n338\n00:16:16.362 --> 00:16:19.988\n1,000, you can probably say this\nisn't bandwidth degradation I mean.\n\n339\n00:16:19.988 --> 00:16:21.343\n>> Well, yes, good point, right?\n\n340\n00:16:21.343 --> 00:16:24.643\nI said, that if you have a 200 gig image,\nit could take a while to deploy it and\n\n341\n00:16:24.643 --> 00:16:26.420\nthat's just on one machine.\n\n342\n00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:32.120\nWhat if you've got a lab of 50 computers\nand you reimage them all at the same time?\n\n343\n00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.825\nOkay, well, now you've got 50 computers\nall trying to transfer 200 gigs of data,\n\n344\n00:16:36.825 --> 00:16:38.658\nit's gonna take longer, right?\n\n345\n00:16:38.658 --> 00:16:41.261\nReimaging one machine might take an hour,\nbut\n\n346\n00:16:41.261 --> 00:16:45.011\nreimaging all 50 machines at\nthe same time might take six hours.\n\n347\n00:16:45.011 --> 00:16:47.580\nAnd it's just because you're saturating\nthe bandwidth on your server.\n\n348\n00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:52.670\nThe solution to that is to either\nimplement more than one server or\n\n349\n00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.780\nto try and shrink your image down.\n\n350\n00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.194\nHow can we shrink our image down?\n\n351\n00:16:56.194 --> 00:16:59.246\nWell when you go to shrink the image\ndown what you do is you say,\n\n352\n00:16:59.246 --> 00:17:01.029\nmy reference machine, my source.\n\n353\n00:17:01.029 --> 00:17:05.601\nLet's put as little data in there as we\ncan, knowing that we can always push out\n\n354\n00:17:05.601 --> 00:17:09.780\nother software by using things like\nApple Remote Desktop or whatever.\n\n355\n00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.606\nWe can push that stuff after the fact and\npotentially get more.\n\n356\n00:17:12.606 --> 00:17:16.834\n>> Don, are we seeing right now on our\nscreen, are we seeing the recovery image\n\n357\n00:17:16.834 --> 00:17:20.071\nitself, while it's now connecting\nback to the server and\n\n358\n00:17:20.071 --> 00:17:22.005\npulling down that Restore Image?\n\n359\n00:17:22.005 --> 00:17:23.354\n>> Yeah, so like I said,\n\n360\n00:17:23.354 --> 00:17:27.900\nbecause I chose the automated option\nbecause I told it the hard drive to use.\n\n361\n00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:32.930\nIt didn't ask me any questions whatsoever,\nit just jumped right in and\n\n362\n00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.660\nstarted to do that install, right?\n\n363\n00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.890\nSo I can see it right here,\nit is cranking along and it says,\n\n364\n00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.950\nrestoring image and it's telling me\nhow much further it's got to go.\n\n365\n00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:45.852\nSo it's doing its work,\nit's kinda doing its thing.\n\n366\n00:17:45.852 --> 00:17:49.277\nHonestly, at this point, it's not really\nall that much more I can do on it.\n\n367\n00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:53.070\nIt's just going to, gotta run, right?\n\n368\n00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.880\nNow, there could have been problems here.\n\n369\n00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:00.110\nSo I can see right there on the screen,\nI guess I have a mouse,\n\n370\n00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.600\nI can point, so it says right there,\nthat it's installing the Macintosh HG.\n\n371\n00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.480\nI know it's small, it's small for\nme too, when you boot into recovery,\n\n372\n00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.160\nyou can't adjust the screen.\n\n373\n00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.390\nIt won't even let us zoom, will it?\n\n374\n00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:13.750\nNo, so we're just kind of stuck there, so\n\n375\n00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.400\nit found the hard drive\ncalled Macintosh HD.\n\n376\n00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.653\nIt formatted it, and now it's copying\nthe 6.9 gig El Capitan installer.\n\n377\n00:18:21.653 --> 00:18:25.163\nAnd now it's actually doing that long,\ndrawn-out process and\n\n378\n00:18:25.163 --> 00:18:27.446\nI didn't have to touch a button, right?\n\n379\n00:18:27.446 --> 00:18:31.430\nHad I not specified the Macintosh HD,\nwhat I would have seen instead is,\n\n380\n00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:32.930\nwhen it got to this screen,\n\n381\n00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:36.940\nit would pop up the Mac OS 10 installer\nwith the little smiley Mac on it.\n\n382\n00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.610\nAnd I would have to hit Next,\nand I'd have to pick a drive, and\n\n383\n00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.360\nthen I'd have to sign off\non the license agreement.\n\n384\n00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.220\nActually, I think the agreement's first\nand then it asks me to pick a hard drive.\n\n385\n00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.200\nAnd once I pick the drive and I hit next,\nthen it would progress to this and\n\n386\n00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.110\nstart to do it but\nI'd have to get involved.\n\n387\n00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.882\nIt's a lot more difficult to do\na large quantity of machines,\n\n388\n00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:55.084\ncuz you gotta go in and\nmake choices on every one.\n\n389\n00:18:55.084 --> 00:18:58.644\n>> Now, if you don't use the default\nMacintosh HD like you're talking about,\n\n390\n00:18:58.644 --> 00:19:01.067\nis there any way that you\ncan like use the Automator?\n\n391\n00:19:01.067 --> 00:19:04.450\nOr at that point are you gonna be in\nfront of the keyboard pushing buttons?\n\n392\n00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:08.420\n>> Your really need to use the Automator,\nI mean, you can use the keyboard.\n\n393\n00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.578\nIf it's one or two machines,\nit's not a big deal.\n\n394\n00:19:10.578 --> 00:19:13.386\nBut if you're about to deploy\nthis to a hundred machines,\n\n395\n00:19:13.386 --> 00:19:15.866\nyou don't wanna have to\ngo to all 100 machines.\n\n396\n00:19:15.866 --> 00:19:19.063\nAnd pick hard drive and\nerase it and then move forward.\n\n397\n00:19:19.063 --> 00:19:20.700\nYou don't wanna have to do that, right?\n\n398\n00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.646\nWith this, all I had to do was pick\nthe startup disc and hit restart and\n\n399\n00:19:24.646 --> 00:19:26.360\nthen I can walk away, right?\n\n400\n00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.204\nAnd it just does it's thing,\nthat's what you want.\n\n401\n00:19:28.204 --> 00:19:32.331\nWith the Automator, you can build\nAutomator steps into your image, and so\n\n402\n00:19:32.331 --> 00:19:35.687\nyou can say erase the hard drive,\ncreate one big partition.\n\n403\n00:19:35.687 --> 00:19:39.210\nAnd name it Macintosh HD and\nthen progress to the insoles.\n\n404\n00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:42.380\nAnd by doing that, you ensure that you've\ngot a hard drive called Macintosh HD, and\n\n405\n00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.190\nyou ensure that's it blank.\n\n406\n00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:47.223\nSo, I definitely recommend doing\nthat if you're gonna go that route,\n\n407\n00:19:47.223 --> 00:19:50.734\nmake sure that that hard drive\nis a consistently named drive.\n\n408\n00:19:50.734 --> 00:19:52.731\n>> If not, you're probably gonna\nhave to take your shoes and\n\n409\n00:19:52.731 --> 00:19:54.628\nline them with a little bit\nof extra radial tire there.\n\n410\n00:19:54.628 --> 00:19:56.308\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz you're gonna wear out, right?\n\n411\n00:19:56.308 --> 00:19:59.974\n>> Well, the joke I always make is\nif you're an hourly employee it's\n\n412\n00:19:59.974 --> 00:20:00.894\ngreat, [LAUGH].\n\n413\n00:20:00.894 --> 00:20:04.869\nIt's job security, but If you're in\na hurry, if it's the end of the day,\n\n414\n00:20:04.869 --> 00:20:08.678\nit's 5 PM, you're ready to go home,\nbut you wanna clean up that lab.\n\n415\n00:20:08.678 --> 00:20:11.880\nWouldn't it be nice if you could\njust walk around to each machine,\n\n416\n00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.041\nchoose the net Restore Image,\nhit restart and then just go home.\n\n417\n00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:17.695\nAnd so, overnight all those\nmachines wipe themselves, and\n\n418\n00:20:17.695 --> 00:20:21.310\nwhen you come in in the morning, the lab\nis fresh and clean and ready to go.\n\n419\n00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:24.940\nNow this is one way to do it right here,\nwhere I had to go and\n\n420\n00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.590\nuse the startup disk preference,\nwe could make it even faster right?\n\n421\n00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:33.600\nBecause the other option was to boot\nthe system while holding down the letter\n\n422\n00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.140\nN on your keyboard.\n\n423\n00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.732\nAnd that would just go and grab the\ndefault image from the net install server.\n\n424\n00:20:38.732 --> 00:20:41.321\nSo now, instead of having\nto go to every machine and\n\n425\n00:20:41.321 --> 00:20:43.319\nlaunch the system preference screen.\n\n426\n00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:46.371\nAnd go into the startup disk and\npick the image, what I could do\n\n427\n00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:51.240\nis I could tell my students, hey, at the\nend of the day, shut your computer down.\n\n428\n00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.464\nAnd so, that way they all shut their\ncomputers off and then before I go home,\n\n429\n00:20:55.464 --> 00:20:59.436\nI just go to each machine, hit the power\nbutton while holding the N key.\n\n430\n00:20:59.436 --> 00:21:02.573\nAnd then it's gonna boot off the network,\nit's gonna grab that default image, and\n\n431\n00:21:02.573 --> 00:21:03.760\nit's gonna deploy it.\n\n432\n00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.580\nSo, if I were to change my default image\nback to that Student Lab Machine, so,\n\n433\n00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.505\nI'm gonna do that here.\n\n434\n00:21:08.505 --> 00:21:11.960\nI'm gonna change the NetRestore\nof Student Lab Machine,\n\n435\n00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.320\nback to my Default Image, right?\n\n436\n00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.365\nThe El Capitan one was my default image.\n\n437\n00:21:16.365 --> 00:21:20.370\nActually, while I'm in here,\nI can go to the connections tab.\n\n438\n00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:24.020\nAnd I can see that Mac mini local,\nthat's deploying the image right now.\n\n439\n00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.620\nSee how it's restoring image,\nand it's 96%, so\n\n440\n00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.660\nI can actually track\nthe image being deployed.\n\n441\n00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.710\nIt's already deployed,\n\n442\n00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:33.390\nI had to hit Cmd+ R to refresh\nthe server app doesn't refresh itself.\n\n443\n00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.310\nAnd I can see that now it's verifying,\nright?\n\n444\n00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:38.961\nSo it's actually going through and I can\njust sit here and hit refresh over and\n\n445\n00:21:38.961 --> 00:21:42.631\nover and over again, as it moves through\nand finishes deploying that image.\n\n446\n00:21:42.631 --> 00:21:46.441\nOnce it's done, the image that\nI pushed was the Net Restore.\n\n447\n00:21:46.441 --> 00:21:47.875\nNo, actually it was the El Capitan one.\n\n448\n00:21:47.875 --> 00:21:50.892\nSo I should have a clean\nEl Capitan install,\n\n449\n00:21:50.892 --> 00:21:54.573\nno Google Chrome,\nno Apple Remote Desktop account.\n\n450\n00:21:54.573 --> 00:21:57.600\nAll that stuff should be gone, because\nI told it to format the hard drive too.\n\n451\n00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.894\nAll that data is gone, and\nnow it's back to stock, right?\n\n452\n00:22:01.894 --> 00:22:06.067\nBut if I wanna make it a student lab\nmachine again, all I need to do now is,\n\n453\n00:22:06.067 --> 00:22:09.025\nbecause I made the lab\nmachine my default image is.\n\n454\n00:22:09.025 --> 00:22:13.384\nTurn the computer off and power it\non while holding N on the keyboard.\n\n455\n00:22:13.384 --> 00:22:17.601\nAnd I was kind of hoping for this image\nto finish, we're at 94%, so if we give it\n\n456\n00:22:17.601 --> 00:22:21.408\njust a second longer it'll finish up,\nand then we'll be able to verify.\n\n457\n00:22:21.408 --> 00:22:23.945\nNow, let me throw out a few other\nlittle words of caution while we're\n\n458\n00:22:23.945 --> 00:22:24.619\nwaiting on that.\n\n459\n00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:31.172\nIf you have multiple Mac\nservers on the network.\n\n460\n00:22:31.172 --> 00:22:34.844\nSo if I have more than one NetInstall\nserver on the network, and\n\n461\n00:22:34.844 --> 00:22:37.490\nI have different default\nimages on each one.\n\n462\n00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.900\nWhat's gonna happen when I boot a Mac and\nhold the N key?\n\n463\n00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:42.990\nIt's gonna be first come, first serve.\n\n464\n00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:46.383\nWhichever server responds first,\nthat's the default image you're gonna get.\n\n465\n00:22:46.383 --> 00:22:48.190\nSo if you have more than one server,\n\n466\n00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.817\nyou kinda wanna make sure they all\nhave the same default image, right?\n\n467\n00:22:51.817 --> 00:22:54.632\nCuz otherwise, you'll get different\nresponses from different machines,\n\n468\n00:22:54.632 --> 00:22:56.980\nwhen you boot them up holding the N\nkey you get different things.\n\n469\n00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.520\nSo, your default image should\nalways be one of those\n\n470\n00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:04.460\nimages that's shared between the servers,\nthat's the same on each one.\n\n471\n00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:08.120\nYou don't have to, you can use a different\none for each server but ideally,\n\n472\n00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.240\nyou'll make them the same.\n\n473\n00:23:10.322 --> 00:23:13.356\nAll right, looks like we just\nfinished doing the verify and so now,\n\n474\n00:23:13.356 --> 00:23:16.726\nit's just gonna do a little bit of\ncleaning up and then it's gonna reboot.\n\n475\n00:23:16.726 --> 00:23:21.659\nWhat it's actually doing is, this is the\npart where it installs any packages and\n\n476\n00:23:21.659 --> 00:23:24.135\nruns any post-installation scripts.\n\n477\n00:23:24.135 --> 00:23:27.540\nAny Automator steps, which I didn't\nhave any because it was a clean install.\n\n478\n00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.130\nSo that went by really fast, right?\n\n479\n00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:33.260\nIt just finished and that was it,\nso now, it's gonna reboot and\n\n480\n00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:36.256\nit should boot into a clean\ncopy of El Capitan.\n\n481\n00:23:36.256 --> 00:23:40.882\nNow, because it was an installer, it\nknows this is a new installation and so,\n\n482\n00:23:40.882 --> 00:23:44.122\nI should start to see\nthe typical installation stuff.\n\n483\n00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:47.188\nThe Sign in with your Apple ID,\nwhat's your user name,\n\n484\n00:23:47.188 --> 00:23:50.401\nthose kind of things that it\nasks during a normal install.\n\n485\n00:23:50.401 --> 00:23:53.660\nIf this was Net Restore,\nit would already have that information.\n\n486\n00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:57.207\nIt would already know what my username\nis and all that, and it wouldn't ask for\n\n487\n00:23:57.207 --> 00:23:59.050\nthem, it would just install it, okay.\n\n488\n00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:02.940\nSo that one is all finished, and looking\nat my server connections it's gone now.\n\n489\n00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.250\nSo I'm no longer connected\nto the server app.\n\n490\n00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:09.930\nThis is now an independent machine, that's\nrunning El Capitan nice and clean, okay.\n\n491\n00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:13.030\nSo the next thing I want to do\nis I wanna actually boot it and\n\n492\n00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.870\ndo that default option just to\nkinda show you guys how that works.\n\n493\n00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:17.640\nSo let's take this little guy and\nboot him off of the network.\n\n494\n00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.230\nI'm just gonna hit the power button and\nhold the end key on my keyboard.\n\n495\n00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.500\nI hear my Apple charm go off\nin the background there.\n\n496\n00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:27.180\nAnd what I should see,\nassuming I'm holding the right letter,\n\n497\n00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:32.340\nis I should see the Apple logo\nappear with a little flashing globe.\n\n498\n00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:33.940\nThere's my flashing globe, all right?\n\n499\n00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.060\nSo the little globe is flashing so that\nlet's me know it's checking the network.\n\n500\n00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:40.270\nIt's looking to find a server\nout there on the network.\n\n501\n00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:41.610\nA net install server.\n\n502\n00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:42.950\nAnd if it finds one,\n\n503\n00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:46.870\nit's gonna kick into that boot\nprocess to install the default image.\n\n504\n00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.680\nAnd as soon as it finds the net\ninstall server, this should change and\n\n505\n00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.580\nI should see the Apple logo.\n\n506\n00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.360\nAnd so\nI'll probably see the Apple logo and\n\n507\n00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.920\nthe globe on the screen at\nthe same time for a brief while.\n\n508\n00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.730\nAnd then as soon as that's done,\nthe globe will go away and\n\n509\n00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.590\nbe replaced by a progress bar as it\nactually starts the installation.\n\n510\n00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:03.640\nIt's all happening in the background.\n\n511\n00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.870\nAnd here on the Mac Mini,\nall we see is the flashing globe,\n\n512\n00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.780\nwhich, take a little longer\nthan it normally would.\n\n513\n00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.720\nLet me just double check and\n\n514\n00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.620\nmake sure I got my network cable plugged\nin, because that does make a difference.\n\n515\n00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.990\nAnd we'll give that a moment.\n\n516\n00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:18.640\nSometimes I get impatient with this stuff.\n\n517\n00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.470\nAnd the idea is you're supposed to\nboot holding N, and then walk away.\n\n518\n00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.280\nAnd you just walk away, leave and\nlet it run and do its thing, and\n\n519\n00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.930\neventually it finds a server.\n\n520\n00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:28.620\nI can look on the server though and do\nsome basic trouble shooting if I'm trying\n\n521\n00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.950\nto figure out what's going wrong so\nlet's jump over to my laptop and do that.\n\n522\n00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:35.300\nIf it's not connecting there must be\nsome problem or, well, there we go.\n\n523\n00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.090\nPatience right?\n\n524\n00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:41.740\nSo we can see here the Apple logo let's me\nknow it did find the net install server\n\n525\n00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.260\nand the globe was that it was\ndownloading the boot files.\n\n526\n00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.360\nBoot files are like 30 megs, pretty small.\n\n527\n00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.620\nNow is actually going and\nkicking forward with the image.\n\n528\n00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.360\nRight?\nSo all that happened if I'd just been\n\n529\n00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.380\npatient and walked away.\n\n530\n00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.540\nBut let's say I was impatient and\nI wanted to troubleshoot it anyway.\n\n531\n00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.620\nLet me show you how I could have told\nit was working even though I wasn't\n\n532\n00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.950\nseeing that on the Mac.\n\n533\n00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:03.100\nOn my server If you up to Logs,\n\n534\n00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:08.110\nin your logs you can filter your\nService Log bound to just net install.\n\n535\n00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.250\nAnd when you filter to net install,\n\n536\n00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:15.420\nwhat you should see are the DHCP\nrequests from the client.\n\n537\n00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:19.440\nSo, the Mac Mini fired up and I can\ntell where it started right here at 955.\n\n538\n00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.590\nRight?\nBecause I got a bunch of activity kicking\n\n539\n00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:25.120\nof, or,\nactually at 959 Is a little more accurate.\n\n540\n00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.510\nSo that's where I actually\nkicked it on right there.\n\n541\n00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:31.960\nOkay, and so looking at what I've got,\nI've got a DHCP discover.\n\n542\n00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.110\nThe Mac Mini booted up and\nsaid hey I need an IP address.\n\n543\n00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:39.240\nAnd I offered an address to it,\nI gave it 192.168.0.150, so\n\n544\n00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:43.610\nthen it sent the request to use it,\nand we acknowledged it.\n\n545\n00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:48.330\nSo we've got that whole DORA part of DHCP,\nthe four step handshake.\n\n546\n00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:53.720\nAs soon as that was done, we got the boot\nstrap protocol kicking in right here.\n\n547\n00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.220\nRight?\n\n548\n00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:58.400\nSo it's kicking in and\nI offered it a net boot image.\n\n549\n00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.610\nThose are the bootable files.\n\n550\n00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:02.220\nI'm not actually using a net boot\nimage I'm using a net install.\n\n551\n00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.700\nBut it's net boot that\nwe actually boot off of.\n\n552\n00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.260\nAnd it's showing the architecture for\nit, and that this is a Mac Mini 7.1,\n\n553\n00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:12.170\nthat's the model the Mac made\nthat was authorized to use this.\n\n554\n00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:13.730\nSo it gets that.\n\n555\n00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:18.300\nIt acknowledged that it was gonna\nboot off of those boot files.\n\n556\n00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.740\nAnd once it booted off of the Boot files,\nright,\n\n557\n00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:27.120\nit revalidated its address,\nit updated its lease on the IP address.\n\n558\n00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.710\nAnd then it said okay now I'm ready\nto actually install something.\n\n559\n00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:31.720\nAnd so we've got it right here.\n\n560\n00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.300\nBSDP INFORM, the server told it, hey,\n\n561\n00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:39.650\nI need you to install this image here,\nand it provided it another image.\n\n562\n00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:42.610\nAnd now, it actually started the install.\n\n563\n00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:44.640\nSo the install should be running.\n\n564\n00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.090\nHere's that acknowledgement where we\nacknowledged that we were getting it.\n\n565\n00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:48.680\nAnd see how it was a list here.\n\n566\n00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.020\nGave me a list of what's available.\n\n567\n00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.340\nAnd here it's a select.\n\n568\n00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.950\nGive me that default image and\nwe're gonna install it.\n\n569\n00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:58.210\nAnd so now that Mac Mini is\nstarting the install process.\n\n570\n00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:59.470\nAnd it's not much to see.\n\n571\n00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:02.510\nIf we jump back over to the Mac Mini,\nit's an Apple logo on the screen and\n\n572\n00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:05.490\na little status bar that's\ngonna crawl across the screen.\n\n573\n00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.930\nAnd this is the bigger image.\n\n574\n00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:09.720\nRight?\nWe did the student lab image.\n\n575\n00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.420\nAnd so it's, I forget how big we said it\nwas, nine gigs or something like that.\n\n576\n00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.750\nSo it's got t o transfer all\nthat data across the network and\n\n577\n00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.280\nit's going to take a while right?\n\n578\n00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.950\nBut at this point It is transferring.\n\n579\n00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:22.080\nNow, interesting thing about this process,\nis that,\n\n580\n00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:27.170\nwhile it's at this state, I may or may not\nactually see it in the connection screen.\n\n581\n00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:30.745\nAnd, if I refresh here, yeah, I'm still\nnot showing it in the connection screen,\n\n582\n00:28:30.745 --> 00:28:32.460\nbecause we're still at the Apple logo,\nright.\n\n583\n00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:36.260\nIf we jump back over to the Mac Mini,\nwe'll see that it is just that Apple logo.\n\n584\n00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.110\nAs long as you're at this screen,\n\n585\n00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.460\nit doesn't actually show\nup in the connections yet.\n\n586\n00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:45.520\nBut, as soon as it advances past this,\nthen it's going to flip over and\n\n587\n00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.070\nits going to start using the actual\nconnection to the server.\n\n588\n00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:50.540\nAnd we will see it show up.\n\n589\n00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.780\nThe main thing that's going on here is\nit's running a lot slower then before.\n\n590\n00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:57.570\nAnd the reason is I had a cross over\ncable run between the Mac Mini and\n\n591\n00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:59.450\nmy laptop a few moments ago.\n\n592\n00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:03.330\nAnd I had to move off to a switch to make\nsure that the net discovery would occur.\n\n593\n00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.480\nWell, when I was on a crossover\ncable I was at a gigabit,\n\n594\n00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.620\nnow I'm only at 100 megabits.\n\n595\n00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.580\nSo it's actually running\nsignificantly slower.\n\n596\n00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:15.060\nKind of shows you how big an impact your\nnetwork speed can have on this process.\n\n597\n00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:19.040\nBut from this point,\nit's identical to what we say earlier.\n\n598\n00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.130\nThe only difference is here is it's\njust gonna use that default image.\n\n599\n00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.130\nSo it's gonna reach out to the server and\ngrab it.\n\n600\n00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:25.490\nInstall it, and when it's done,\nit'll boot back up.\n\n601\n00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:28.250\nAnd because I did the lab machine,\nI should have Google Chrome,\n\n602\n00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:31.090\nI should have the Apple Remote Desktop\naccount, all that stuff should still be\n\n603\n00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:34.980\npresent, because that's part of the net\nrestore image that we pushed out.\n\n604\n00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.390\n>> All right Don,\na lot of great information, but\n\n605\n00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:39.860\nit does look like we're coming to\nthe end of another great episode.\n\n606\n00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.984\nBut before we sign out,\nyou got anything else for us?\n\n607\n00:29:41.984 --> 00:29:46.100\n>> Yeah, key thing, the thing we don't\nsee in the lab here that I do is\n\n608\n00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.550\ndefinitely pay attention\nto your bandwidth.\n\n609\n00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:49.870\nPay attention to how loaded\nyour servers get, and\n\n610\n00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:54.290\nrecognize that today you might not need\nmore than one net install server but\n\n611\n00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:56.970\ndown the road you might need more or\nyou might need to add a second or a third.\n\n612\n00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:59.770\nAnd it's easy enough to do as long as\nyou keep your index number straight.\n\n613\n00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:04.550\nIt's a pretty straightforward system and\nit makes deploying Mac OS pretty easy and\n\n614\n00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:05.860\neven if you've got hundreds or\n\n615\n00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.300\nthousands of machines you can\nknock things out pretty quick.\n\n616\n00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.810\n>> Well Don as always,\nwe appreciate you being in the studios and\n\n617\n00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:12.350\nwe appreciate you, the viewer watching.\n\n618\n00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:14.270\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign out for ITProTV.\n\n619\n00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:15.634\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n620\n00:30:15.634 --> 00:30:16.390\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n621\n00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:18.654\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n622\n00:30:18.654 --> 00:30:26.300\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Bryan.\n\n3\n00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:19.437\nAnd in today's episode we\nare continuing through our series on\n\n4\n00:00:19.437 --> 00:00:24.211\nMac OS X Server Essentials, and we're\nfocusing in on providing network services.\n\n5\n00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:28.093\nAnd today, we're gonna be taking a trip\nback in time, driving 88.5 miles an hour,\n\n6\n00:00:28.093 --> 00:00:30.985\njust kidding you here,\nwe're gonna be looking at Time Machine.\n\n7\n00:00:30.985 --> 00:00:33.063\nAnd to help us out with that is Mr.\nDon Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:33.063 --> 00:00:34.283\nDon, how're you doing today, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:34.283 --> 00:00:37.509\n>> I am doing great, Wes, ready to dive\nright back into OS X Server Essentials.\n\n10\n00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:40.092\nAnd like Wes said, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at Time Machine.\n\n11\n00:00:40.092 --> 00:00:44.590\nAnd I know what some of you guys are\nthinking, we said network services, right?\n\n12\n00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.990\nTime Machine is not a network service.\n\n13\n00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.450\nIf I have a desktop or a laptop,\nI can just hook a hard drive up to it and\n\n14\n00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.120\ndo a Time Machine backup.\n\n15\n00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.152\nWell, there actually is a network version\nof Time Machine where we can set up\n\n16\n00:00:55.152 --> 00:00:58.176\na centralized server to\nprovide Time Machine services.\n\n17\n00:00:58.176 --> 00:01:00.575\nAnd you'll see it's actually\nnot that hard to set up and\n\n18\n00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:02.470\nthere's a lot of good reasons to do that.\n\n19\n00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.470\nSo before I dive into that though, let's\njust cover a couple of basics here to make\n\n20\n00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.640\nsure that everybody's on the same page.\n\n21\n00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.365\nI imagine if you're watching this\nshow that you've probably implemented\n\n22\n00:01:11.365 --> 00:01:12.191\nTime Machine before.\n\n23\n00:01:12.191 --> 00:01:15.705\nBut if you haven't, let's just\nkinda recap what that does, right?\n\n24\n00:01:15.705 --> 00:01:19.845\nTime Machine is a built-in backup\nprogram that's a part of OS X.\n\n25\n00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:23.275\nAnd it's not necessarily\na part of the server app,\n\n26\n00:01:23.275 --> 00:01:25.405\nit's a part of the base\noperating system itself.\n\n27\n00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:30.041\nSo if you have a Mac that's been\nmanufactured in the last, probably\n\n28\n00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:34.700\nlike eight years I think, then it's going\nto have Time Machine built into it.\n\n29\n00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.600\nNow it's not turned on by default.\n\n30\n00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.580\nSo just because the support is there\ndoesn't mean you're actually running it,\n\n31\n00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.600\nit is up to you to get it set up.\n\n32\n00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.440\nThe idea is that you could hook up a hard\ndrive, a Thunderbolt hard drive, or\n\n33\n00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.515\nUSB FireWire, or\neven an extra internal hard drive, but\n\n34\n00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:51.215\nsome kind of extra hard drive.\n\n35\n00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:55.525\nYou hook it up to your system,\nand the Mac will back itself up.\n\n36\n00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:58.025\nAnd if there's ever a problem, and\n\n37\n00:01:58.025 --> 00:02:00.105\nthe problems could kind of span\nseveral different sources.\n\n38\n00:02:00.105 --> 00:02:02.020\nBut if there's ever a problem,\nyou could go and\n\n39\n00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.250\nrestore your data from that hard drive,\nso you don't lose any information.\n\n40\n00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.650\nThat's the nice part.\n\n41\n00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.680\nApple tried to make it\nas easy as possible, so\n\n42\n00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.370\nTime Machine is very flexible,\nvery simple to get going, and\n\n43\n00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.920\nwe're gonna see that as\nwe move through here.\n\n44\n00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.020\nIt's designed to be a simple technology\nto make it a lot more approachable for\n\n45\n00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.310\nregular end users.\n\n46\n00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.450\n>> Don, with the Time Machine that's\nbuilt in, they really do make it easy.\n\n47\n00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.870\nI've got a Western Digital drive,\n1 terabyte, set up for Mac and everything.\n\n48\n00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.314\nAll I had to do is plug it in and\n\n49\n00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:30.100\nit basically helped me out\nthrough the whole process.\n\n50\n00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.790\nSo if I've got that,\nif you've got that into your computer,\n\n51\n00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.540\nwhy would we need the server?\n\n52\n00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.470\n>> All right, so here's the thing,\n\n53\n00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.730\nif we've got tons of people's\ncomputers that are out there, right?\n\n54\n00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.620\nIf it's just one, it's not a big deal,\nyou do just like Wes said,\n\n55\n00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.350\nyou stick a drive on there, and\nit'll automatically pop up.\n\n56\n00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.330\nHey, do you wanna use this drive for\nTime Machine, you just hit Yes, and\n\n57\n00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.950\noff you go, right?\n\n58\n00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.136\nBut if you've got 1,000 people out there,\n\n59\n00:02:53.136 --> 00:02:57.300\ndo you wanna pass out\n1,000 USB hard drives?\n\n60\n00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.850\nProbably not.\n\n61\n00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.320\nAnd the other thing is, let's say\nyou do that, let's say all right,\n\n62\n00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.300\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsend out 1,000 of these USB hard drives.\n\n63\n00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.370\nHow do I know that people\nare actually plugging them in?\n\n64\n00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.035\nSomebody might plug in and\ndo the first back up, and\n\n65\n00:03:07.035 --> 00:03:09.592\nthen they stick the hard drive in their\ndesk drawer, and they're like, yep,\n\n66\n00:03:09.592 --> 00:03:10.282\nI've got a back up.\n\n67\n00:03:10.282 --> 00:03:12.910\n[LAUGH] And that's it,\nand then they just go.\n\n68\n00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.100\nWell now, they're not backing up anymore,\nthe hard drive is in their desk drawer.\n\n69\n00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.611\nAnd they've gotta remember to go and\nplug that thing back in,\n\n70\n00:03:19.611 --> 00:03:21.700\notherwise it's not gonna perform a backup.\n\n71\n00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.744\n>> Okay, I'm guilty, I gotta say.\n\n72\n00:03:23.744 --> 00:03:27.431\nI'm running Time Machine backups, okay,\nand I'm looking at my machine today, and\n\n73\n00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:30.160\ntoday it's May 13th, right,\nwhen we're recording this.\n\n74\n00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.829\nAnd I'm looking at the last time I backed\nup, I think I'm guilty here, May 3rd,\n\n75\n00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.874\nso I'm not following the backups.\n\n76\n00:03:36.874 --> 00:03:38.802\n>> Yep, so you're creeping up\non two weeks without a backup.\n\n77\n00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:39.962\nSo what's gonna happen?\n\n78\n00:03:39.962 --> 00:03:43.220\nOne day you have a failure, and that\nfailure could be any number of things.\n\n79\n00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.030\nIt could be the hard drive fails.\n\n80\n00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.300\nIt could be somebody steals your laptop,\nthey just steal the whole thing, right?\n\n81\n00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.610\nThe hard drive's perfectly fine,\nyou just don't have it any more.\n\n82\n00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.550\nIt could be that you\naccidentally delete a file.\n\n83\n00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.440\nIt could be that you modified a file.\n\n84\n00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.320\nMaybe I went inside of\na Microsoft Word document and\n\n85\n00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.000\ndeleted a paragraph and saved it.\n\n86\n00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.490\nAnd then later on I'm like, I wish I\nhad that paragraph back again, right?\n\n87\n00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.760\nOr I edited a photo to try and\nremove red eye and messed it up, and\n\n88\n00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.440\nI'm like,\nI wish I had that original file again.\n\n89\n00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.452\nI know, I'll go back to my Time Machine,\nexcept the last Time Machine back up was\n\n90\n00:04:14.452 --> 00:04:17.200\nback on May 3rd,\nit's been almost two weeks.\n\n91\n00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.070\nI don't have that data now, right?\n\n92\n00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.810\nThat's what happens,\nthat's where your users get.\n\n93\n00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.580\nThe idea behind\nTime Machine is to be easy.\n\n94\n00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.825\nWhen you plug that drive in and\nsay yes, I wanna use Time Machine,\n\n95\n00:04:26.825 --> 00:04:29.365\nit does a full back up of\nyour computer right there.\n\n96\n00:04:29.365 --> 00:04:32.518\nSo it backs up 100% of\nthe data on your hard drive,\n\n97\n00:04:32.518 --> 00:04:34.420\nall gets backed up to the drive.\n\n98\n00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.130\nThen it runs a backup every hour.\n\n99\n00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.865\nEvery hour, once an hour,\nit runs a back up of your computer, so\n\n100\n00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:42.608\nthat it gets all the changes.\n\n101\n00:04:42.608 --> 00:04:45.218\nIt doesn't do 100% of the backup,\nit just backs up the changes,\n\n102\n00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:48.300\neverything that's changed in\nthe last hour, and it backs it up.\n\n103\n00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.790\nAnd then it tries to save as\nmany changes as possible,\n\n104\n00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.890\nas many changes as can\nfit on that hard drive.\n\n105\n00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.320\nIf I have a 500 gig hard\ndrive in my computer and\n\n106\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.840\nI stick a 1 terabyte drive\nonto it from my backup,\n\n107\n00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.340\nwell, the full backup of my\ndrive could be up to 500 gigs.\n\n108\n00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.770\nBut then the changes that occur will start\nto fill up the remainder of that drive,\n\n109\n00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.000\nand it'll try and\ngo back as far as possible.\n\n110\n00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.805\nBy default, Time Machine backs up\nonce an hour for the last 24 hours.\n\n111\n00:05:14.805 --> 00:05:18.120\nSo it's gonna save hourly backups for\nlast 24 hours.\n\n112\n00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.020\nThen it saves daily backups for\nthe last week.\n\n113\n00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.230\nThen it saves weekly backups for\n\n114\n00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.640\nas far back as it can go without\nrunning out of hard drive space.\n\n115\n00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.812\nAnd when it does run out of hard drive\nspace, it deletes old backups to make room\n\n116\n00:05:30.812 --> 00:05:33.039\nfor new backups so\nit's constantly cycling through.\n\n117\n00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.710\nBut it can go back pretty far,\nassuming the drive is plugged in.\n\n118\n00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.760\nIf you don't plug the drive in,\nit's not gonna back up.\n\n119\n00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.694\nAnd I know even my personal laptop here,\nlet's look at my personal laptop.\n\n120\n00:05:43.694 --> 00:05:47.825\nSo when I'm here doing a show like this\none, I've got the laptop right here on\n\n121\n00:05:47.825 --> 00:05:51.780\nthe desk with me and I don't have\nmy Time Machine drive hooked up.\n\n122\n00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.760\nBecause I don't want a backup\nrunning while I'm doing the show.\n\n123\n00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.180\nBut when the show is over,\nI take my laptop and\n\n124\n00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.340\nI stick it in a docking station.\n\n125\n00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.320\nAnd when I do that, Time Machine hooks up,\nand so it's able to backup.\n\n126\n00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.060\nAnd I leave it connected and so\nwhen I go into Time Machine on my laptop,\n\n127\n00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.010\nif it ever gets there,\nI can actually see it right here.\n\n128\n00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.890\nI can see the last back up occurred\ntoday at 8:11 AM, all right.\n\n129\n00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.210\nWell, you can see my clock,\nit's 10:50 AM right now.\n\n130\n00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.490\nSo it's been two hours\nsince I've had a backup,\n\n131\n00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.470\nit should have backed up twice since then.\n\n132\n00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.380\nBut I've taken my laptop out of the dock,\nI did that this morning, and so,\n\n133\n00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.180\nit hasn't backed up since that point.\n\n134\n00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.680\nBut it's been backing up prior to that.\n\n135\n00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.680\nAnd if I go into Time Machine,\nI can see that last backup.\n\n136\n00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.910\nNext back up?\n\n137\n00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.310\nWhenever the disk is connected again.\n\n138\n00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.020\nThe next time I plug it in,\nit's gonna run that backup, all right.\n\n139\n00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.110\nBut it's doing hourly backups for\nthe last 24 hours, daily backups for\n\n140\n00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.032\nthe past month.\n\n141\n00:06:43.032 --> 00:06:44.952\nYou know actually I think I said\ndaily backups for the last week,\n\n142\n00:06:44.952 --> 00:06:46.230\nit is actually the last month.\n\n143\n00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.770\nAnd then weekly backups as far back as\nit can go until that disk becomes full.\n\n144\n00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.096\nAnd if I were to enter Time Machine\non this system to try and\n\n145\n00:06:55.096 --> 00:07:00.277\nrestore files, what I'm gonna see is,\nlet me just cancel that.\n\n146\n00:07:00.277 --> 00:07:02.878\nMy disk isn't connected so\nit's complaining about that.\n\n147\n00:07:02.878 --> 00:07:06.979\nBut when I go to look at my historical\nfiles, there'll be gaps in it, and\n\n148\n00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:11.280\nthose gaps equal whenever I didn't\nhave the drive attached, right?\n\n149\n00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.330\nAnd your end users are gonna\nfrequently do this,\n\n150\n00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.020\nwhere they don't plug in their drive.\n\n151\n00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.760\nSo an alternative to doing that, where\nour end users don't have to worry about\n\n152\n00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:25.780\na drive, is that in the server app,\nwe actually have a Time Machine server,\n\n153\n00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.770\na Time Machine service that we can set\nup right inside of our server app.\n\n154\n00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.540\nAnd what it allows us to do is instead\nof using a USB hard drive as a back up,\n\n155\n00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.970\nwe can back up to an OS X server.\n\n156\n00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.500\nThe cool part there is if you\ntake a laptop like Wes's,\n\n157\n00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.260\nright, anytime he connects to\nthe network here at the ITProTV studio,\n\n158\n00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.410\nhe can see our Time Machine server and\nbackup to it.\n\n159\n00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.926\nHe doesn't even have to plug in a cable.\n\n160\n00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:53.152\nJust when he walks in the building and\nhis laptop is on, it sees the network,\n\n161\n00:07:53.152 --> 00:07:55.938\nit sees the Time Machine server,\nand it backs up.\n\n162\n00:07:55.938 --> 00:07:59.589\nSo now there's no more worrying about\nUSB hard drives, plugging them in, or\n\n163\n00:07:59.589 --> 00:08:00.960\nlosing them, or whatever.\n\n164\n00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.345\nIt's all centralized on the server.\n\n165\n00:08:02.345 --> 00:08:08.620\nThe other thing is, if I've got 1,000\nusers, I don't want 1,000 USB hard drives.\n\n166\n00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:13.670\nI can just have one centralized server,\nand those 1000 users can all backup to it.\n\n167\n00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.860\nNow, you're probably seeing\nthe weak point here.\n\n168\n00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.460\nThe weak point is storage.\n\n169\n00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.130\nThat if I want to back up\none person's computer and\n\n170\n00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:26.950\nthey've got a 256 gig SSD in it, well,\nI can get them a small USB hard drive and\n\n171\n00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.600\nthey can backup, and that's easy.\n\n172\n00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.280\nBut if I have 1,000 people that\nall have 256 gig hard drives\n\n173\n00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.790\nthat's a lot of storage.\n\n174\n00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.060\nWe're talking about\nterabytes worth of storage.\n\n175\n00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.660\nI'm gonna need a server that has\nterabytes of storage to be able to\n\n176\n00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.450\nstore all that, right?\n\n177\n00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.050\nSo you've got to plan your\nTime Machine server out for that.\n\n178\n00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.710\nIt needs to have the appropriate\nnetwork bandwidth and\n\n179\n00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.996\nit needs to have the appropriate storage\nto contain all of those backups.\n\n180\n00:08:50.996 --> 00:08:54.040\n>> So Don, you know as lazy\nas I've been apparently for\n\n181\n00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.940\nthe last ten days with my backups,\nyou said\n\n182\n00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.460\nif I plug my computer into the network\n>> It's gonna see the Time Machine server.\n\n183\n00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.502\nHow is it gonna see that\nTime Machine server?\n\n184\n00:09:03.502 --> 00:09:05.750\n>> All right, so\nit's using Bonjour to discover this, and\n\n185\n00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:06.930\nit kinda happens already.\n\n186\n00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.850\nLet me show you on a client here.\n\n187\n00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.465\nI'm gonna take this one.\n\n188\n00:09:10.465 --> 00:09:13.030\nThis is a stock install of El Capitan.\n\n189\n00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.580\nI haven't messed with it at all.\n\n190\n00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.450\nI just created my user account\nduring the install and that's it.\n\n191\n00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:23.283\nAnd on this one, if I go into my System\nPreferences, and I go into Time Machine.\n\n192\n00:09:23.283 --> 00:09:30.610\nNow Time Machine really expects us\nto have a removable drive attached.\n\n193\n00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.990\nSo when I go into it,\nhere's the Time Machine setup and\n\n194\n00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.540\nit's asking me to pick a backup disk.\n\n195\n00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.360\nAnd you see the same pick a disk,\n\n196\n00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.910\nokay you're gonna have a disk\nattached to this computer.\n\n197\n00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.200\nBut I don't I don't have\na disk attached to it.\n\n198\n00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.520\nSo when I go to select a backup\ndisk no disk shows up.\n\n199\n00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.090\nThe only thing that does show up\nis Other AirPort Time Capsule.\n\n200\n00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.100\nWhat's that?\n\n201\n00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:54.090\nWell Apple has the AirPort\nwireless access points, and\n\n202\n00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.450\na normal AirPort is just\nan access point and that's it.\n\n203\n00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.690\nBut if you take a normal AirPort and\n\n204\n00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:04.040\nyou plug USB hard-drives into it,\nit turns it into a Time Capsule.\n\n205\n00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.370\nOr Apple has a specifically\nbranded as a Time Capsule,\n\n206\n00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.860\nwhere it is an AirPort with\nthe hard drives inside of it.\n\n207\n00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.630\nYou can get a three terabyte Time Capsule.\n\n208\n00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:12.750\nThey're not terribly expensive.\n\n209\n00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.480\nAnd you can stick it on your network, and\nnow you've got a wireless access point and\n\n210\n00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.650\nrouter that's capable of\nbeing a backup destination.\n\n211\n00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.520\nAnd for home users that works out great.\n\n212\n00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.990\nIf you have a home or\neven a small office, four or\n\n213\n00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:27.000\nfive computers,\nthose Time Capsules work great.\n\n214\n00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.210\nBut if you have a thousand computers,\n\n215\n00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.890\nthe biggest time capsule they sell\nI'm pretty sure is three terabytes.\n\n216\n00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:32.850\nI don't think they have anything bigger.\n\n217\n00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.835\nThat's not going to be enough.\n\n218\n00:10:34.835 --> 00:10:38.520\nYou can't back up more than a handful of\ncomputers with three terabytes of data.\n\n219\n00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.210\nSo you're gonna need another option.\n\n220\n00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.810\nAnd it doesn't show it here, it doesn't\nsay it, but when I'm sitting here at this\n\n221\n00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:52.360\nwindow my computer is actively sending\nout Bonjour discovery messages.\n\n222\n00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.430\nAnd saying, hey,\nanybody out there a Time Machine sever?\n\n223\n00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.940\nAnd if there were Time Machine servers\non the network they would respond and\n\n224\n00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.670\nthey would show up right\nhere on this list.\n\n225\n00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:00.970\nRight now I don't have any.\n\n226\n00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.520\nAll right, let's fix that.\n\n227\n00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.480\nLet's get a Time Machine server and\nwe'll see it up here.\n\n228\n00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.028\nI'm going to cancel this just\nbecause there isn't one.\n\n229\n00:11:06.028 --> 00:11:10.510\nWe'll come back to this client though\nto get that set up here in a minute.\n\n230\n00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:14.460\nNow on the server, Time Machine\nis one of the default services.\n\n231\n00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.796\nI can see it right here in the server app.\n\n232\n00:11:15.796 --> 00:11:20.140\nI've got the time machine server, and\nI can jump in, and I can set that up.\n\n233\n00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.340\nBut I need to be really\ncareful about this.\n\n234\n00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.520\nStorage is my number one concern.\n\n235\n00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.630\nI need to make sure I have a plan for\nthat.\n\n236\n00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.260\nFigure out how many computers\nyou're going to have backing up and\n\n237\n00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.540\nlook at the size of their hard drives.\n\n238\n00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.500\nNow you might have a laptop like mine,\n\n239\n00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.500\nwhere I've got a 500 gig\nhard drive in my laptop.\n\n240\n00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.470\nSo if I take my hard drive,\n\n241\n00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.980\nI could say, hey,\na backup of this is gonna be 500 gigs.\n\n242\n00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.850\nBut if you look at it,\nI'm only using half of my hard drive.\n\n243\n00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.274\nI've got 500 gigs of storage.\n\n244\n00:11:47.274 --> 00:11:52.580\nI've only used 259 gigs,\nI've got 240 gigs available.\n\n245\n00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.660\nSo on a Time Machine server I'm\ngonna use 259 gigs of storage.\n\n246\n00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.140\nWell not necessarily.\n\n247\n00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.960\nThere's a few things that\nadjust how this works.\n\n248\n00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.660\nFirst off, yes, I probably am\ngonna use about that much space.\n\n249\n00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.370\nBut secondly,\nI've got where my changes occur, and\n\n250\n00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:13.550\nit's tracking more than\none version of a file.\n\n251\n00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:17.810\nIf I have a one megabyte file and\nI make changes to it,\n\n252\n00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:22.700\nnow it's like have two one megabyte files,\nthe original version and the new version.\n\n253\n00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.940\nIt's tracking the changes and\nstoring them separately.\n\n254\n00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.030\nSo, the revisions I make\nthe more space I'm gonna consume.\n\n255\n00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:34.255\nYou might have somebody with a 500 gig\nhard drive and they're actually consuming\n\n256\n00:12:34.255 --> 00:12:39.340\n1.2 terabytes of storage, and it's because\nof all the changes that have occurred.\n\n257\n00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.270\nSo understand that people can take\nup more space than the actual size\n\n258\n00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.530\nof their hard drive.\n\n259\n00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.690\nThe other thing to remember is that\n\n260\n00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:50.950\na lot of the files that are in here are\nsystem files, like the operating system.\n\n261\n00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.570\nAnd when you run a Time Machine backup,\n\n262\n00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:57.330\nit actually won't put the operating\nsystem files in that Time Machine backup.\n\n263\n00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.170\nThere's no need to back that up.\n\n264\n00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:03.530\nThe reason is you can't restore Time\nMachine backups unless you've already got\n\n265\n00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:04.430\nthe operating system back.\n\n266\n00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:08.690\nSo you're gonna boot to recovery and\nrestore Time Machine from there.\n\n267\n00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:12.470\nWell if you boot to recovery, it's going\nto have access to the install files, so\n\n268\n00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.100\nit doesn't need them to\nbe a part of the backup.\n\n269\n00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:19.250\nSo some of the 239 gigs that I'm\nusing is actually gonna be excluded,\n\n270\n00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.340\nbut I'm just gonna eat that\nback up with changes anyway.\n\n271\n00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:26.880\nSo just assume, you know what\nhappens when you assume, right?\n\n272\n00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.820\nBut assume that your users\nare going to use more storage\n\n273\n00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.900\nthan whatever their maximum\nhard drive size is.\n\n274\n00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.750\nSo even though I'm not using 500 gigs,\n\n275\n00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:38.840\nI'll probably consume more on backups,\nnot on day one, but definitely on day 200.\n\n276\n00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.005\nAnd definitely on day 1,000\nas we track more and more.\n\n277\n00:13:42.005 --> 00:13:44.930\nNow what's going to happen really is your\nTime Machine hard drive is going to fill\n\n278\n00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:49.430\nup, and it's going to start deleting older\nbackups to make room for newer backups.\n\n279\n00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.640\nSo you'll still be able to\nbackup all your users But\n\n280\n00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.660\nhow far back in time you go\nis what's gonna be affected.\n\n281\n00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.910\nSo you might find that right now\nyou can restore people's files from\n\n282\n00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:59.570\nsix months ago.\n\n283\n00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:04.430\nBut next year, you might only\nbe able to go back one month.\n\n284\n00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.781\nAnd in two years from now, you might\nonly be able to go back one week.\n\n285\n00:14:06.781 --> 00:14:09.891\nAnd it's because that drive's filling\nup and it's running out of room.\n\n286\n00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:12.124\nIt's deleting old backups for\nnew ones and so\n\n287\n00:14:12.124 --> 00:14:14.930\nmay need to expand\nthe storage on your server.\n\n288\n00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:18.640\nHaving an Xsan, or\nsome kind of external drive array,\n\n289\n00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.430\ncan really help with that cuz you can\nthrow additional hard drives in and\n\n290\n00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.930\nget more, and more, and\nmore storage as you go.\n\n291\n00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.690\nBut just be aware that the amount of\nstorage you have is really gonna effect\n\n292\n00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:28.190\nhow far back in time you can go.\n\n293\n00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:31.650\nAll right, so\nlet's get back to setting up this server.\n\n294\n00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:35.860\nSo if I jump back over to my server,\nI'm in my Time Machine back up.\n\n295\n00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.560\nI have an extra hard drive\nattached to my system.\n\n296\n00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.000\nAnd that's important\nbecause my Macintosh HD,\n\n297\n00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.190\nif I look at it,\nis a blazing 43 gigs in size.\n\n298\n00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.850\nI am not gonna be able to\nbackup anything on that.\n\n299\n00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:48.510\nThat's just not gonna be enough.\n\n300\n00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.540\nBut I've got this extra storage\ndrive sitting here, and\n\n301\n00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:56.780\nthe extra storage drive is,\nlooks like, about 550 gigs in size.\n\n302\n00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.950\nSo it's actually got\na good bit of space on it.\n\n303\n00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.540\nI can back up a handful of things to that.\n\n304\n00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:05.220\nI may need more in the future, but\nfor right now I can use this drive.\n\n305\n00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:12.637\nTo use a drive for Time Machine, it has\nto be formated OS10 Extended (Journaled).\n\n306\n00:15:12.637 --> 00:15:15.903\nWe have support for FAT32,\nand exFAT, and other,\n\n307\n00:15:15.903 --> 00:15:20.280\nlike some of the Unix file systems,\nwe have support for that.\n\n308\n00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.306\nBut Time Machine, the way it tracks\nthe changes is part of what's built-in to\n\n309\n00:15:24.306 --> 00:15:26.451\nthe OS X Extended (Journaled) format.\n\n310\n00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:30.741\nSo if you attach a hard drive, like if you\ngo and buy an external drive, a lot of\n\n311\n00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:35.098\ntimes the vendors will format it exFAT\nbecause exFAT works on Windows and Mac.\n\n312\n00:15:35.098 --> 00:15:36.392\nSo they're just trying\nto hedge their bets,\n\n313\n00:15:36.392 --> 00:15:38.095\nlike we don't if you're gonna\nuse it on Windows or a Mac, so\n\n314\n00:15:38.095 --> 00:15:39.740\nwe'll just format it this way.\n\n315\n00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.830\nBut then you won't be able to use it for\nTime Machine, so you'll need to format it.\n\n316\n00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.910\nAnd you just jump into Disk Utility and\nformat.\n\n317\n00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.025\nIt's not really a big deal.\n\n318\n00:15:46.025 --> 00:15:48.483\n>> So Don,\none of the things I wanted to ask is,\n\n319\n00:15:48.483 --> 00:15:52.676\nwhen it comes to storage locations,\ndo I only have a single storage point?\n\n320\n00:15:52.676 --> 00:15:54.289\nOr do we have more than one?\n\n321\n00:15:54.289 --> 00:15:55.679\n>> Well that's a good point.\n\n322\n00:15:55.679 --> 00:15:57.325\nHard drives only come so big, right.\n\n323\n00:15:57.325 --> 00:16:00.880\nSo you can go and I think you can, can\nyou get eight terabyte hard drives now?\n\n324\n00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.600\n>> I've seen the four terabytes.\n\n325\n00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.230\n>> I know fours are pretty regular.\n\n326\n00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:05.470\n>> Yeah.\n>> I think you can get eight\n\n327\n00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:06.260\nterabytes now.\n\n328\n00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.630\nIf you have an external array you can\nget arrays that hold 16 drives, and\n\n329\n00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.340\nso you can really start\nto grow them pretty big.\n\n330\n00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.630\nBut eventually you're gonna hit\nthe maximum for scaling up, and\n\n331\n00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.360\nyou're gonna have to do\nis called scaling out.\n\n332\n00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.110\nWhich is the add additional locations,\nadditional drives, and the time machine\n\n333\n00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:25.010\nserver lets you do that, so\nyou can have more than one drive added in.\n\n334\n00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:28.570\nLet me kind of show you the process here,\nso I'm in the server and\n\n335\n00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.710\nI've just gone in the time\nmachine service right here, so\n\n336\n00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:34.060\nI haven't really done anything\nother than click that.\n\n337\n00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.470\nI guess kind of under\nachieving this episode,\n\n338\n00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.580\nso when we go into\nthe time machine service.\n\n339\n00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.500\nThere's not a whole lot to configure.\n\n340\n00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.190\nYou've got your settings\nthat I'm looking at now.\n\n341\n00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.690\nAnd then backups just shows you\nwhat backups have already occurred.\n\n342\n00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:46.650\nAnd when I look at the settings,\n\n343\n00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.580\nyou've got permissions as far\nas who's allowed access to this.\n\n344\n00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.170\nAnd you'll probably wanna restrict that.\n\n345\n00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.460\nYou probably don't want just every person\nin the company being able to back up,\n\n346\n00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.430\ncuz you'll start to run\nout of hard drive space.\n\n347\n00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:59.640\nSo you wanna pick and\nchoose who you allow to back up.\n\n348\n00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.720\nBut this is the important part right here,\nbackup destinations.\n\n349\n00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.310\nI can add in a drive like that storage\ndrive that I already I already have, so\n\n350\n00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:10.390\nI can click on that and I'll go in,\nI'll choose that storage drive.\n\n351\n00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:11.940\nSo I'm just gonna come in here and\npick that one.\n\n352\n00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.470\nAnd we'll choose it, and\n\n353\n00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:18.460\nnow I've got /Volumes/Storage, that's\ngonna be my primary backup location.\n\n354\n00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:19.070\nAll right?\n\n355\n00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:24.040\nAnd once that's added I just hit Create\nand now I've got a backup folder and\n\n356\n00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.190\nit shows us having 548\ngigs of available storage.\n\n357\n00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.810\nSo there it is, it's ready to rock and\nI can start to backup.\n\n358\n00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:31.960\nBut what happens when that fills up?\n\n359\n00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.970\nIt starts deleting old stuff\nto make room for new stuff.\n\n360\n00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:39.080\nSo I can add more locations to\nincrease that hard drive size\n\n361\n00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.640\nbecause if this is a 500 gig hard drive,\nI can't make it any bigger.\n\n362\n00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.080\nI would have to replace it.\n\n363\n00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.090\nThen I'd have to copy back ups over and\nall that, this could be a perfectly good\n\n364\n00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.990\ndrive, so I could leave it and\nI could add another one.\n\n365\n00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:52.000\nI do actually have another\ndrive on this system so\n\n366\n00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.670\nlet me show you the whole process\nof getting a drive brought in here.\n\n367\n00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.480\nI'm going to fire up my disc utility\nbecause the first thing I need to\n\n368\n00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.725\ndo is I need to format it.\n\n369\n00:17:58.725 --> 00:18:00.675\nSo I've got this drive sitting here.\n\n370\n00:18:00.675 --> 00:18:03.225\nIt's another 500 gig drive,\nbut it's not formatted.\n\n371\n00:18:03.225 --> 00:18:04.775\nSo I'm gonna erase it.\n\n372\n00:18:04.775 --> 00:18:08.365\nAnd when you erase it you need to make\nsure that you do OS X extended journal.\n\n373\n00:18:08.365 --> 00:18:11.890\nThat's what it's got to be to\nsupport the Time Machine backups.\n\n374\n00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.570\nAnd I'm just gonna call\nthis one Storage 2.\n\n375\n00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:16.400\nCuz I'm creative when it\ncomes to names like that.\n\n376\n00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.400\nAnd that one's gonna format.\n\n377\n00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.830\nNow, as soon as it's done formatting,\n\n378\n00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:24.610\nMAC OS without the server app, will try\nand use that for Time Machine backup.\n\n379\n00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:27.790\nSo I get, do you want to use Storage 2 for\nTime Machine backup?\n\n380\n00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.760\nwell yeah that's what I want right?\n\n381\n00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.420\nNo.\nNo it's not what I want.\n\n382\n00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.380\nThat's if I wanted to back up this server.\n\n383\n00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.950\nDo I want to use it to back up this\nserver and that's not what I want.\n\n384\n00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.840\nI want to make this part of\nthe time machine server so\n\n385\n00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.870\nit's really important that\nyou say don't use here.\n\n386\n00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.980\nSo yes I want to use it with time machine\nbut not the way they mean it here.\n\n387\n00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.400\nThey mean to back up the server,\nI need it for other things so\n\n388\n00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.740\nI'm going to say don't use.\n\n389\n00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.040\nAll right, so that's done.\n\n390\n00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.660\nAnd now I can go back into my\nserver app and under time machine,\n\n391\n00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:03.480\nunder backup destinations I can hit add\nand I can choose that second drive.\n\n392\n00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.220\nWell, there's old Storage 2, so\nI'll go ahead and choose that one and\n\n393\n00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.540\nnow I've got a second drive\nthat I'm going to be adding in.\n\n394\n00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.700\nAnd once that's in place\nI can just hit create.\n\n395\n00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.720\nThere it is.\n\n396\n00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.720\nAnd now,\nI've got another 504 GB of storage\n\n397\n00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.290\navailable because it's\nanother 500 GB drive.\n\n398\n00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.180\nNotice the name,\nhow one was called backups and\n\n399\n00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:28.450\nthe other is called backups-1 but the\ndrives are called storage and storage 2.\n\n400\n00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:30.120\nWhere do these names come from?\n\n401\n00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.030\nWell, These are share points right?\n\n402\n00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:35.820\nJust like we talk about in the share\nfolder episode here, these are shared\n\n403\n00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:40.900\nfolders and shared folder names don't have\nto match the underlying folder structure.\n\n404\n00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.530\nIn fact these aren't even\npointing at the drive,\n\n405\n00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.760\nthey are pointing at a folder\ninside of the drive.\n\n406\n00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.590\nIf I browse into Storage or Storage 2,\n\n407\n00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:51.380\nwhat it did is it made a folder\nin there called Shared items.\n\n408\n00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.760\nAnd in that folder is backups and\n\n409\n00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.300\nin that is where our time\nmachine backups will end up.\n\n410\n00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.590\nSo we'll have like the old backup DB type\nfiles that are part of time machine.\n\n411\n00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.700\nAnd if I go into the other drive,\nI go into storage two and\n\n412\n00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.780\nshared items, it's called backups also.\n\n413\n00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.840\nThe share name is backups dash 1\nbecause we can't have two shares with\n\n414\n00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.870\nthe same name.\n\n415\n00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.500\nBut the folders themselves\nactually do have the same name.\n\n416\n00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.200\nAll right, so\nI can continue to add more drives.\n\n417\n00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.290\nSo as I fill up I can\njust keep adding more.\n\n418\n00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.580\nThat way I don't loose\nmy older back-ups and\n\n419\n00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.220\nyou just kind of scale\nthe way you need it.\n\n420\n00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.860\n>> All right Don, let's say speaking\nof drive spilling up, all right?\n\n421\n00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.970\nLet say another host is here at ITProTV,\nRonnie and\n\n422\n00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:36.650\nmyself we got 250 Gigs of drive space\nthat we need to store in that server but\n\n423\n00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:40.360\nout of 1 terrabyte drive\nwe've only got 250 gigs left.\n\n424\n00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.090\nAre we gonna have to just stop the whole\nprocess and instead we play rock, paper,\n\n425\n00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.520\nscissors, what's gonna happen?\n\n426\n00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.810\n>> I'm gonna call you out West so here\namongst the hosts at ITProTV I've never\n\n427\n00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:53.780\nmet a person who loved iso\ndisk images more than Wes.\n\n428\n00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.190\nThis guy has so many disk images.\n\n429\n00:20:56.190 --> 00:21:00.520\nSo if you have a user that's consuming\nfar more storage than everybody else,\n\n430\n00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.530\nthat hurts everybody, right?\n\n431\n00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:06.470\nBecause Time Machine needs to make\nroom for that user's backups and\n\n432\n00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:07.880\nthey're gonna delete older backups.\n\n433\n00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:12.080\nNot just from that user but\nfrom every user to make room.\n\n434\n00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.010\nSo one user can hurt everybody else.\n\n435\n00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.740\nSo it's a good idea to set a quota.\n\n436\n00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.310\nNow when you create a user in like\nOpen Directory, you can set a quota there.\n\n437\n00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:23.490\nBut the quota applies to\ntheir home directory.\n\n438\n00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.770\nTime Machine doesn't\npay attention to that.\n\n439\n00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.170\nBecause that user's home director,\n\n440\n00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:31.110\nwe need to maintain multiple versions of\nit will often times exceed that quota.\n\n441\n00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:33.870\nBut you can set a quota\non the disks themselves.\n\n442\n00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.400\nYou probably noticed it when I set it up,\nI kinda skipped the option, but\n\n443\n00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.160\nlet me pull it back up.\n\n444\n00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:42.150\nI'm gonna take just the backups drive,\nthat first one and I'll edit it and\n\n445\n00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.000\nyou'll see where I've got the option\nto set up a backup limit.\n\n446\n00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.780\nLimit each backup to\na certain amount of space.\n\n447\n00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.690\nAnd this is gonna hold users\nto a certain size, right?\n\n448\n00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.600\nNow it doesn't let me pick and choose\nby individual user, this is everybody.\n\n449\n00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:01.140\nSo I can say, I gotta 500 gig drive\nI want to make sure that nobody takes\n\n450\n00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.640\nmore than a certain amount, right.\n\n451\n00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.020\nWell here,\n\n452\n00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:11.470\nI'm saying limit each backup to 500\ngigs of space I drop that down and say.\n\n453\n00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.840\nA hundred gigs.\n\n454\n00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.590\nLimit each back-up to it.\n\n455\n00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:18.660\nNow as I set it,\nnotice this little note down here.\n\n456\n00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.540\nOnly Macs running OS X Mavericks or\nnewer will obey this limit.\n\n457\n00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.200\nThis is a feature they set in Mavericks.\n\n458\n00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.770\nIt's up to the client to\ncheck what the limit is.\n\n459\n00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.150\nIf you're running Mountain Lion.\n\n460\n00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:32.370\nIt's actually not going to check\nit's going to ignore the limit.\n\n461\n00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.230\nAnd it will do a backup\neven bigger than that.\n\n462\n00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:35.660\nSo it's kind of enforced\non the client side.\n\n463\n00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.450\nWhich isn't necessarily\nthe most effective thing.\n\n464\n00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:40.190\nSo there are other ways\nthat we can achieve it.\n\n465\n00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:41.020\nBut this is a quick and\n\n466\n00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:45.220\neasy way to make sure that one user\ncan't monopolize the whole thing.\n\n467\n00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.710\nBe aware that it is set per drive though.\n\n468\n00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.220\nSo I just set it here\non this back up drive.\n\n469\n00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.580\nI also need to go and\n\n470\n00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.950\nadjust it on the other drive if\nI want it to be set everywhere.\n\n471\n00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:56.630\nSo I'm going to come in on this one and\n\n472\n00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:00.300\nset it to 100 also,\ndoing that same basic limit.\n\n473\n00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:05.260\nYou guys can start to see where\nhere I've got two 500 gig drives,\n\n474\n00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:09.370\nthat's really not going to be enough to\nmanage any large amount of computers.\n\n475\n00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.490\nYou're gonna need far more storage\nthan what I'm allocating here.\n\n476\n00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:17.220\nAll right, so now that that's in place,\nI've got a location for\n\n477\n00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.710\nmy backups to go created.\n\n478\n00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.230\nI've got my system set up.\n\n479\n00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.960\nWell, now I just need to turn it on.\n\n480\n00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.250\nSo I'm gonna hit that on switch.\n\n481\n00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:27.050\nI know I've forgotten in\nmultiple episodes now, so\n\n482\n00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:28.280\nI'm gonna remember to do it this time.\n\n483\n00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.650\nI hit my on switch, and\nnow I'm a Time Machine server.\n\n484\n00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.324\nAll right, so\nwhat do we do on our clients?\n\n485\n00:23:33.324 --> 00:23:37.300\nWell remember the beginning of the episode\nI went to a client, I went to turn on time\n\n486\n00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:40.700\nmachine, it didn't have any extra\nhard drives, so those didn't show up.\n\n487\n00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.417\nThe only thing that showed\nup were time capsules.\n\n488\n00:23:43.417 --> 00:23:46.818\nIt was looking for airport time capsules,\nwhich we don't have any.\n\n489\n00:23:46.818 --> 00:23:48.362\nWell, I guess that's not necessarily true.\n\n490\n00:23:48.362 --> 00:23:50.463\nWe have some here in the studio,\nbut what this can see.\n\n491\n00:23:50.463 --> 00:23:54.317\nBut now, when I go to configure\nTime Machine on this client,\n\n492\n00:23:54.317 --> 00:23:58.030\nI can go to Select a Backup Disk,\nand it scans the network.\n\n493\n00:23:58.030 --> 00:23:59.320\nAnd look what it finds.\n\n494\n00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:03.620\nIt finds OSX-SERVER01,\nright, that's my server.\n\n495\n00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.930\nAnd it sees the two backup locations,\nBackups and Backups-1.\n\n496\n00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:09.920\nAnd so,\nI can pick which one I want to backup to.\n\n497\n00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:14.030\nIf one is filling up, I can go to\nthe other one and start to spread\n\n498\n00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:18.430\nout on that server, so that we don't\nrun out of space with our backups.\n\n499\n00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:20.070\nI'm just gonna pick the first one here.\n\n500\n00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:23.010\nBut see how I didn't even have to tell it,\nit found that automatically,\n\n501\n00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:24.100\nthat's Bonjour doing that.\n\n502\n00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.370\nI can still do a Time Capsule,\nI can still do local drives.\n\n503\n00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:31.299\nRemember, your local Time Machine can be\nconfigured to back up to more than one\n\n504\n00:24:31.299 --> 00:24:35.663\nlocation, but I want this networked one,\ncuz that's what this episode is all about.\n\n505\n00:24:35.663 --> 00:24:37.839\nAll right, now we do have the option\nto encrypt the backups, and\n\n506\n00:24:37.839 --> 00:24:39.430\nlet me just mention this real quick.\n\n507\n00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:40.880\nProbably won't turn up on the exam,\n\n508\n00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.490\nbut a lot of people wanna encrypt\nthe backups to keep their data private.\n\n509\n00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.850\nIf we're backing up to a central location,\nin theory,\n\n510\n00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:51.100\none user could get in another\nuser's backup, couldn't they?\n\n511\n00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.570\nAnd that would be bad.\n\n512\n00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:56.070\nWell, fortunately, they are protected,\npermissions are applied.\n\n513\n00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:59.660\nThat's another reason why the drive has to\nbe formatted OS X Extended (Journaled), so\n\n514\n00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:03.130\nthey can apply POSIX\npermissions to those files.\n\n515\n00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.706\nThat's gonna give us protection there too,\nbut if you want the utmost assurance that\n\n516\n00:25:06.706 --> 00:25:09.400\nyour data's kept private,\nyou'll wanna encrypt the backup.\n\n517\n00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.450\nAnd you can do that.\n\n518\n00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:14.810\nIf you encrypt the backup,\nit is stored encrypted on the server, and\n\n519\n00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:16.290\neven if somebody does get at the files,\n\n520\n00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:20.790\nthey won't be able to mess with it unless\nthey know the key to decrypt that data.\n\n521\n00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.060\nAll right, I'm going to leave\nmine unencrypted though.\n\n522\n00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.090\nAnd just hit Use Disk.\n\n523\n00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:27.500\nSo, it's connecting to the server,\nand now I've got to authenticate.\n\n524\n00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.610\nThis is how it's gonna know who I am, so\n\n525\n00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:32.110\nit can set the permissions properly,\nright?\n\n526\n00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.940\nOtherwise, how does it know who\nthe give permissions to the backup to.\n\n527\n00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.940\nSo, I've gotta provide it\nwith a network account.\n\n528\n00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.642\nIf I had Open Directory set up,\nI'd use the Open Directory account.\n\n529\n00:25:39.642 --> 00:25:42.590\nHere, I just have a local\none that I'm gonna use.\n\n530\n00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.850\nAnd so, I'll get that specified,\nand that's gonna connect up.\n\n531\n00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:49.880\nAnd it shows, 549 GB available on\nthe server, Oldest Backup: None,\n\n532\n00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.310\nand it's getting ready to take a backup.\n\n533\n00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:55.300\nA backup which I'm gonna\nstart a little early.\n\n534\n00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:59.533\nSo, I don't wanna wait, so\nwe will backup now, and there it goes.\n\n535\n00:25:59.533 --> 00:26:01.580\nSo now, it's looking for\nthe backup disk, right?\n\n536\n00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.470\nIt's gotta verify it can\nactually contact the server.\n\n537\n00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.570\nCuz, it could've been hours\nsince it's seen that server.\n\n538\n00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:10.360\nIf we took our laptop home and we just\ncame back into the office, it's just now\n\n539\n00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.820\non the wireless network, it's gonna\nlook for that server and connect, right?\n\n540\n00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.425\nNow a quick word of caution here.\n\n541\n00:26:15.425 --> 00:26:17.765\nYour initial backup is your biggest one.\n\n542\n00:26:17.765 --> 00:26:20.225\nSo, it's gotta do a full\nbackup from my computer.\n\n543\n00:26:20.225 --> 00:26:23.885\nIf I go and configure this on a thousand\nmachines all at the same time,\n\n544\n00:26:23.885 --> 00:26:26.355\nthey're all gonna go to backup\nwithin two minutes, and\n\n545\n00:26:26.355 --> 00:26:29.425\nI'm gonna saturate the bandwidth\non my server, right?\n\n546\n00:26:29.425 --> 00:26:32.745\nAfter the first backup,\nnow it's just backing up changes.\n\n547\n00:26:32.745 --> 00:26:34.540\nAnd we don't worry about that so much.\n\n548\n00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.470\nBut, you probably don't\nwanna turn on Time Machine\n\n549\n00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.190\non a thousand computers all at once.\n\n550\n00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:41.350\nYou probably wanna roll it out slowly.\n\n551\n00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:44.113\nAnd roll it out to ten machines here,\nand ten machines there, and\n\n552\n00:26:44.113 --> 00:26:45.429\nten machines somewhere else.\n\n553\n00:26:45.429 --> 00:26:47.829\nA great way to do that is\nwith Apple Remote Desktop.\n\n554\n00:26:47.829 --> 00:26:50.894\nApple Remote Desktop can push the\nconfiguration settings for Time Machine.\n\n555\n00:26:50.894 --> 00:26:54.780\nAnd, you can set it to only apply to\na handful of computers per hour and\n\n556\n00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.189\nspread it out over days.\n\n557\n00:26:56.189 --> 00:27:00.070\nSo, it's a great way to do it where you're\nnot having to get manually involved.\n\n558\n00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.200\nAll right, now,\nit's preparing the backups.\n\n559\n00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.200\nIf you look at my little status here,\nit says it's preparing backup.\n\n560\n00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.992\nIt's not actually backing up.\n\n561\n00:27:05.992 --> 00:27:07.080\nWhat is preparing?\n\n562\n00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:11.400\nWell, it's looking at my hard drive and\nindexing all the files it needs to backup,\n\n563\n00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.110\nand it's starting to create\nthe directory structure on the server.\n\n564\n00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:18.780\nSo, even though I'm not backing up yet,\nnow I am, I stalled long enough.\n\n565\n00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.970\nSo, now it's actually started backing up.\n\n566\n00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:25.830\nI can jump over to the server and I'll see\nthat it's creating a structure over here.\n\n567\n00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:30.150\nIf I browse into the Storage Drive,\nand I browse into Shared Items, and\n\n568\n00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:32.990\nBackups, this was empty.\n\n569\n00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.580\nNow, I've got Don's Mac, right?\n\n570\n00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:40.500\nFor each user that backs up, it's gonna\ncreate an item inside of here for them.\n\n571\n00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.740\nAnd so, I'll be able to see all the\ncomputers in my company that are backing\n\n572\n00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.190\nup, right here in one central location.\n\n573\n00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:51.170\nAnd, if we try and browse inside\nof that now I can start to see\n\n574\n00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:55.900\nthe actual Time Machine backup information\nthat we'd normally see on a computer and\n\n575\n00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.940\nthe data that's being backed\nup as a part of that.\n\n576\n00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.720\nUnless it's encrypted, if it's encrypted\nwe really won't be able to get much\n\n577\n00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.630\nfurther than what we're\nlooking at right here.\n\n578\n00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.976\nOkay, but it is backing up.\n\n579\n00:28:04.976 --> 00:28:09.503\nThis screen right here doesn't necessarily\nrefresh for us, we've seen that before,\n\n580\n00:28:09.503 --> 00:28:11.593\nwhere we have to do a Cmd+R or whatever.\n\n581\n00:28:11.593 --> 00:28:13.726\nBut, it is starting to update,\n\n582\n00:28:13.726 --> 00:28:18.180\nsee how it's only got 548.1\nGB available instead of .95?\n\n583\n00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.010\nSo, it is starting to fill, and\n\n584\n00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:24.460\nwe'll see this progress bar change to\nreflect that storage being consumed.\n\n585\n00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:28.295\nAnd instead of browsing to the hard drive,\nwe can go right over here to this Backup\n\n586\n00:28:28.295 --> 00:28:31.050\ntab, and now I can see\nthe backups that are available.\n\n587\n00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:34.450\nAnd so, I see Don's Mac right here,\nwhich is owned by me.\n\n588\n00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:39.120\nBackup is currently in progress, and\nit's tied to the first Backup drive,\n\n589\n00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.420\nnot Backups-1.\n\n590\n00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.950\nAnd the current size is 621.1 MB.\n\n591\n00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.670\nSo, I can see all of my users.\n\n592\n00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:48.600\nI can see how much space they're using,\nand\n\n593\n00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.060\nI can see the last time they backed up.\n\n594\n00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.190\nSo, see how it says Latest Backup,\nBackup in progress.\n\n595\n00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:53.570\nSo, I know they're backing up now.\n\n596\n00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:57.230\nIf I wasn't backing up now it would\ntell be the last time that I did backup.\n\n597\n00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:59.310\nSo, you can sort by this column and\n\n598\n00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.630\nfind users that haven't\nbacked up in over a week.\n\n599\n00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:02.600\nAnd you can call them on the phone and\n\n600\n00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.330\nsay, hey,\nI don't have a good backup of your system.\n\n601\n00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:06.450\nYou haven't backed up in over a week.\n\n602\n00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:08.246\nYou need to connect to the network,\nwhat's going on?\n\n603\n00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:10.090\nAnd they say, well, I was on vacation.\n\n604\n00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:12.640\nLike okay, we'll let that slide.\n\n605\n00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.847\nOr, you find out, well, you know,\nI've been working from home, and\n\n606\n00:29:15.847 --> 00:29:18.530\nI just haven't come into\nthe office to get that connected.\n\n607\n00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:22.610\nAnd you can say, well, understand if you\nlose your laptop you're gonna lose this\n\n608\n00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:25.110\nwhole week's worth of data because I\ndon't have a backup for it, right?\n\n609\n00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:27.199\nWe can start to communicate\nthat to the users.\n\n610\n00:29:27.199 --> 00:29:31.690\nAnd, if you're really worried about it,\nyou can set up a VPN.\n\n611\n00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:34.790\nSo that remote users can VPN in,\n\n612\n00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:39.130\na virtual private network, and connect and\ndo the Time Machine backup over a VPN.\n\n613\n00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.330\nBe careful though, you don't wanna\ndo the initial backup that way,\n\n614\n00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.080\ncuz the backup's gonna be huge.\n\n615\n00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.930\nBut the other backups are just changed\nfiles, and the bigger those are the more\n\n616\n00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.040\ninternet bandwidth it's gonna\nconsume to do that backup.\n\n617\n00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.200\nIt may just take a long\ntime to backup that way.\n\n618\n00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.830\nHourly backups might not be possible.\n\n619\n00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.150\nSo, just a little caveat there.\n\n620\n00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:57.520\n>> We've seen a lot of great\ninformation about Time Machine.\n\n621\n00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.505\nDon, I'm looking at the time,\n\n622\n00:29:58.505 --> 00:30:00.526\ndoes look like we're coming to\nthe end of another great episode.\n\n623\n00:30:00.526 --> 00:30:03.080\nBut before we do that,\ngot any final words?\n\n624\n00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.980\n>> Main thing,\ngetting it set up is really easy.\n\n625\n00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.550\nYou guys saw here,\nit's just a couple of steps.\n\n626\n00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:09.770\nMonitoring, right, constant vigilance.\n\n627\n00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.100\nYou are gonna run out of hard drive\nspace on your Time Machine server.\n\n628\n00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.140\nIt's a given right.\n\n629\n00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.000\nIt's gonna back up as much as it can\nuntil it runs out of hard drive space.\n\n630\n00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.340\nAnd when that happens, it's gonna start\ndeleting the older backups to make room.\n\n631\n00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:23.160\nPay attention to that, pay attention\nto how far back in time you can go.\n\n632\n00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.440\nBecause, you probably have some kind of\nservice level agreement in your company\n\n633\n00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.510\nthat says, we need to be able to\nback up data up to a month ago.\n\n634\n00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.942\nSo, you need to make sure you've\ngot enough storage on the server to\n\n635\n00:30:32.942 --> 00:30:33.503\nsupport that.\n\n636\n00:30:33.503 --> 00:30:36.040\nIf you start seeing that time\ncreep closer, and closer, and\n\n637\n00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.700\ncloser to the present,\nit means you need to add storage.\n\n638\n00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.020\nSo, you can't just turn this on and\n\n639\n00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:43.560\nforget about it, you've gotta pay\nattention to it, you've gotta watch it.\n\n640\n00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:45.434\nAnd make sure you got enough\nstorage to support it,\n\n641\n00:30:45.434 --> 00:30:46.573\njust keep an eye on the server.\n\n642\n00:30:46.573 --> 00:30:47.919\n>> Thank you for that information, Don.\n\n643\n00:30:47.919 --> 00:30:49.808\nAnd thank you,\nthe viewer here, for watching.\n\n644\n00:30:49.808 --> 00:30:53.220\nI'm gonna go clean out my ISO folder\nbefore I have to clean out my desk.\n\n645\n00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.920\nBut, before we do that we're gonna go\nahead and sign out here at ITProTV.\n\n646\n00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.350\nI've been your house Wes Bryan.\n\n647\n00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:58.470\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n648\n00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:00.592\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n649\n00:31:00.592 --> 00:31:08.300\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:18.490\nI'm your host Wes Brian and today's\nepisode we're continue through our series\n\n4\n00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.160\non Mac OS X server essentials and we've\nbeen looking at providing network services\n\n5\n00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.100\nand more specifically, we're going to\nbe focusing in on the world of DHCP.\n\n6\n00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.690\nHelp us out with that is Don Pezet,\nDon how you doing today sir?\n\n7\n00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.575\n>> I'm doing great, Wes,\nready to jump into acronym soup today.\n\n8\n00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:39.145\nWe're gonna be covering DHCP, which is\nthe Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.\n\n9\n00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:40.645\nThat's quite a mouthful.\n\n10\n00:00:40.645 --> 00:00:44.955\nAnd what it is is a neat little network\nservice that almost everybody runs.\n\n11\n00:00:44.955 --> 00:00:48.145\nThe odds are you're running\nit on your network right now.\n\n12\n00:00:48.145 --> 00:00:52.465\nWhat we need to see is that we can\nactually use our Mac as that DHCP server\n\n13\n00:00:52.465 --> 00:00:53.165\nif we want.\n\n14\n00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:56.155\nNow, I guess before I get ahead of myself,\nwhat the heck is DHCP?\n\n15\n00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:57.400\nWhat does it do?\n\n16\n00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.820\nWell whenever you plug a computer into\na network, or even connect to a wireless\n\n17\n00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.140\nnetwork, if you wanna communicate on\na network, you have to have an address.\n\n18\n00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.700\nAnd most networks use what's called IP,\nor the internet protocol, and so\n\n19\n00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.700\nyou have an IP address.\n\n20\n00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.440\nWe've seen them in some\nof the other episodes,\n\n21\n00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.410\nwhere you had an address attached so\nthat we could talk.\n\n22\n00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.840\nNow where do you get that address from?\n\n23\n00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.915\nYour computer doesn't really care,\n\n24\n00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:21.400\nthere's a number of different\nplaces it can get it.\n\n25\n00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.580\nAs long as it has one it'll use it and\nit'll work.\n\n26\n00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.520\nSo we can give our computer\na address by hand if we want, but\n\n27\n00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.500\nimagine if you had a laptop or your iPhone\nor an iPad and you go home and you connect\n\n28\n00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.010\nto a network, and then you go to Starbucks\nand you use their wireless network, and\n\n29\n00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.540\nthen you get to the office and\nyou plugin to their network.\n\n30\n00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.690\nImagine having to go in and\n\n31\n00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.778\nchange your IP address every single\ntime you connect to a network.\n\n32\n00:01:44.778 --> 00:01:46.900\nThat would be really frustrating.\n\n33\n00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.030\nMost people don't want to deal with that.\n\n34\n00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.000\nMost people don't even know\nwhat an IP address is, so\n\n35\n00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.220\nthey don't want to worry\nabout that at all.\n\n36\n00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.090\nSo that's where DHCP comes in.\n\n37\n00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.535\nDHCP takes an IP address and\nmakes it dynamic, right?\n\n38\n00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:01.215\nDynamic host configuration.\n\n39\n00:02:01.215 --> 00:02:03.765\nWe're going to configure our laptops,\nour desktops,\n\n40\n00:02:03.765 --> 00:02:07.255\nwhatever with a dynamic set of values so\n\n41\n00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:11.637\nwe don't have to manually put them in,\nand they can change on the fly as needed.\n\n42\n00:02:11.637 --> 00:02:13.665\nSo that when I travel from one network,\nto another,\n\n43\n00:02:13.665 --> 00:02:16.860\nto another,\nmy system automatically configures it.\n\n44\n00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.980\nThe way it works is when your computer\nboots up, it sees the network.\n\n45\n00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.250\nAnd if it has an address already,\nit'll talk and it will be fine.\n\n46\n00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.880\nBut if it doesn't have an address,\nit will shout out on the network.\n\n47\n00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.440\nIt will say, hey, is there somebody\nout there who can help me?\n\n48\n00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.230\nI need an address.\n\n49\n00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.676\nI can't talk without an address.\n\n50\n00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:36.570\nSomebody help.\n\n51\n00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.980\nI say it's shouting,\nit's actually called broadcasting.\n\n52\n00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.560\nA broadcast is a message that is\njust thrown on the network and\n\n53\n00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.670\ngoes to everyone.\n\n54\n00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.100\nIt's done without an address.\n\n55\n00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.590\nIt actually does have an address,\nbut it's a fake kind of address,\n\n56\n00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.475\nbut one that's designed to\njust go out to everybody.\n\n57\n00:02:50.475 --> 00:02:53.895\nAnd if you have a DHCP\nserver on the network,\n\n58\n00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:58.045\nthe DHCP server can respond back and\nsay, hey, let me help you out.\n\n59\n00:02:58.045 --> 00:02:59.855\nHere's an address that you can use.\n\n60\n00:02:59.855 --> 00:03:03.825\nHere's some other information you\ncan use to get on the network and\n\n61\n00:03:03.825 --> 00:03:05.045\nto start talking.\n\n62\n00:03:05.045 --> 00:03:08.055\nThe DHCP server will\nhelp you get connected.\n\n63\n00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:10.455\nAnd this is all done\ninvisibly to the end user.\n\n64\n00:03:10.455 --> 00:03:12.155\nThe end user doesn't\nknow this is happening.\n\n65\n00:03:12.155 --> 00:03:14.230\nIt's just an automatic process.\n\n66\n00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.770\nAnd boy is it nice.\n\n67\n00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.500\nAnd that's why I say,\n\n68\n00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.180\nmost of you out there in TV land\nare probably using this right now.\n\n69\n00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.330\nYour router might be doing it,\nor your wireless access point,\n\n70\n00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.670\nyou might have a dedicated server\non the network who's doing it, but\n\n71\n00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.240\nyou can use the OS X server app also.\n\n72\n00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.310\nIt's got a DACP server built into it.\n\n73\n00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.090\nIt's turned off by default.\n\n74\n00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.190\nWe can turn it on and start automatically\nconfiguring machines on our network.\n\n75\n00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.230\nSo it's a nice little process.\n\n76\n00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.620\nIt's not that hard to get set up.\n\n77\n00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.880\nIf you're using another\ndevice as your DACP server,\n\n78\n00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.580\ndon't feel like you have to\nuse the server app, right?\n\n79\n00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.560\nIt can certainly do it but usually if\nyou have a router that's providing it,\n\n80\n00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.380\nit's kind of better to leave it there.\n\n81\n00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.920\nJust let the router handle\nit's dedicated hardware.\n\n82\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.530\nBut if you don't, if you don't have a DHP\nserver on network, you can use your Mac.\n\n83\n00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.380\nI does a great job, works really well.\n\n84\n00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.744\nYou can get it set up and you can manage\nit right from in the server app and\n\n85\n00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:07.773\nthat's what we are going to see\nright here in this episode.\n\n86\n00:04:07.773 --> 00:04:12.164\n>> Don, one of the things I was going to\nask is if we have seen you aesthetically\n\n87\n00:04:12.164 --> 00:04:13.315\nconfigure an IP.\n\n88\n00:04:13.315 --> 00:04:15.585\nWe see the setting and the parameters.\n\n89\n00:04:15.585 --> 00:04:18.400\nI know I can set an IP address as well.\n\n90\n00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.500\nWhy wouldn't I just go\nfrom machine to machine?\n\n91\n00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.510\nWhat would be some of\nthe benefits of having DHCP,\n\n92\n00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.030\nrather than me just doing sneakernet?\n\n93\n00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.790\n>> All right, so\nfirst off there's just effort, right.\n\n94\n00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.070\nIf I have 1,000 machines,\nI'd have to go to all 1,000 of them and\n\n95\n00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.260\nmanually put in an address.\n\n96\n00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.730\nThat's gonna take a lot of work.\n\n97\n00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.380\nRight?\n\n98\n00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.960\nVersus they're just automatic.\n\n99\n00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.010\nAll we do is push a power button now, and\nthey get their address and it's done.\n\n100\n00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.030\nSo that's one thing,\nit saves us a lot of effort.\n\n101\n00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.590\nAnother is, if I have to manually type in\nthe address, Wes, you've seen me type.\n\n102\n00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.420\nIt's typo city.\n\n103\n00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.010\nI'm gonna make mistakes left and right.\n\n104\n00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.370\nAnd if you make a mistake,\nnow your machine can't talk.\n\n105\n00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.920\nRight?\nSo you're prone to making mistakes.\n\n106\n00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.780\nBut probably the riskiest part,\n\n107\n00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.350\nthe worst part,\nis if we do manual address assignment\n\n108\n00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.560\nit is super easy to accidentally use the\nsame address on more than one computer.\n\n109\n00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.320\nIf you use the same address on more\nthan one computer, it's a conflict and\n\n110\n00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.800\none of them won't be able to talk.\n\n111\n00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.830\nIt'll basically be stuck on\nthe network and it can't communicate.\n\n112\n00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.410\nSo you run the risk of duplicate IPs.\n\n113\n00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.900\nAnd how do you solve that?\n\n114\n00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.770\nWell in the old days we\nuse to make a spreadsheet.\n\n115\n00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.780\nYou use to keep a notebook and\nsay I put this IP on this computer.\n\n116\n00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.940\nWell, that's fine if you\nhave ten computers or\n\n117\n00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.700\n50 computers, but if you have 5,000\ncomputers that's one big notebook.\n\n118\n00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.460\nAnd you know you're updating it, but\n\n119\n00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.410\nare the other people in\nthe office updating it?\n\n120\n00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.300\nYou go to go to use an IP address one\nday and it turns out it's already taken.\n\n121\n00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.320\nIt becomes a management nightmare.\n\n122\n00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.190\nDHCP solves all that.\n\n123\n00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.488\nIt's a dynamic database.\n\n124\n00:05:39.488 --> 00:05:43.250\nIt tracks and it makes sure that it\nnever issues the same address twice.\n\n125\n00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.890\nIt makes sure that everything's entered in\nproperly and it solves all of that for us.\n\n126\n00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.550\nSo it really is a great technology.\n\n127\n00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.850\nIt's pretty much almost like\nan essential service on a network.\n\n128\n00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.539\nSo it's nice that we have that ability\nto make our OS X server do that.\n\n129\n00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.810\nAll right, well, let's see how this works.\n\n130\n00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.770\nSo I've got a server right here and my\nserver has an address, it's 192.168.1.151.\n\n131\n00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.000\nSo if I want somebody else to\nbe able to talk to my server,\n\n132\n00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.665\nthey need to be on this same network.\n\n133\n00:06:10.665 --> 00:06:13.955\nThey need to 192.168.1 something right?\n\n134\n00:06:13.955 --> 00:06:18.675\nSo I've got a workstation over here that\nI want to be able to talk to that server.\n\n135\n00:06:18.675 --> 00:06:24.545\nAnd if I just take this workstation and\nplug it into my network and I try and\n\n136\n00:06:24.545 --> 00:06:29.865\ntalk to the server, well, I can see right\nhere, I fire up my network utility.\n\n137\n00:06:29.865 --> 00:06:34.060\nAnd I can try to ping 192.168.1.151.\n\n138\n00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.260\nI'm gonna go ahead and try and ping it.\n\n139\n00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.800\nNo route to host, no route to host,\ntime out, time out, right?\n\n140\n00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.940\nIt's not working, okay.\n\n141\n00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.590\nWhy isn't it working?\n\n142\n00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:50.040\nWell it's not working because this\nmachine isn't configured for the network.\n\n143\n00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.050\nWhen I plugged it into the network,\nit didn't have a static IP address, so\n\n144\n00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.820\nit tried to get one.\n\n145\n00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.720\nWell, I don't have a DHCP server,\nso it couldn't get one.\n\n146\n00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:07.240\nSo when a Mac doesn't have an IP and\nit can't learn an IP, what does it do?\n\n147\n00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.610\nIt makes one up.\n\n148\n00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.200\nIt just makes up an address, cuz I'm\ngonna pick one and see what happens.\n\n149\n00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.670\nAnd it's easy to spot it if\nI get back to my info tab,\n\n150\n00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.030\nsee how my address is 169.254.20.140,\nall right?\n\n151\n00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.290\nAnytime that you see an address\n\n152\n00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.220\nthat start with 169.254,\nyou can tell it made it up, right?\n\n153\n00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.620\nThose are called APIPA address, which is,\n\n154\n00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.300\nlet me see if I can remember this,\nit's a, shoot, what is it?\n\n155\n00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.950\n>> Automatic Private IP Addressing.\n\n156\n00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:37.520\n>> There we go.\n\n157\n00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.550\nWes is my acronym finder here.\n\n158\n00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.220\nSo Automatic Private IP Addressing.\n\n159\n00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.080\nIP, Internet Protocol addressing.\n\n160\n00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.490\nSo it's automatic.\n\n161\n00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.112\nIt made it up, and\nit did as good as it could.\n\n162\n00:07:48.112 --> 00:07:51.257\nIf there's no DHCP server on\nthe network and I have ten computers,\n\n163\n00:07:51.257 --> 00:07:54.906\nthey all make up addresses, they would\nall make up a 1 6 9 2 5 4 address and\n\n164\n00:07:54.906 --> 00:07:58.358\nthey'd be able to see each other,\nright, so they at least get by there.\n\n165\n00:07:58.358 --> 00:08:00.723\nNow, that's really useful on Windows.\n\n166\n00:08:00.723 --> 00:08:03.718\nOn Mac we don't even care about that\nbecause you can use Bonjour and\n\n167\n00:08:03.718 --> 00:08:06.127\nfind each other regardless\nof what address you have so\n\n168\n00:08:06.127 --> 00:08:09.818\nBonjour saves us a lot of trouble, but for\na windows machine that can be helpful but\n\n169\n00:08:09.818 --> 00:08:11.880\neither way on a Mac it's\nusually a bad thing.\n\n170\n00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.620\nIf you see 169.254 that's\nnormally a bad thing\n\n171\n00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.840\nit means things didn't work out on\nyour network, ok we need an address.\n\n172\n00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.740\nAnd I can do it manually,\nI can come into my system preferences,\n\n173\n00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.810\nI can go into network, and\nI can assign an address.\n\n174\n00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.820\nRight now, my network adapter\nshows as self-assigned IP.\n\n175\n00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.050\nIn other words, we made it up.\n\n176\n00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:37.030\nWe just assigned it ourselves,\nwe don't know, we just made it up.\n\n177\n00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.860\nSo looking over here,\nit shows it's being made up.\n\n178\n00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.690\nWell, I can change it to manual and\n\n179\n00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:49.550\nnow I can type in 192.168.1.whatever,\nright, so maybe I'll be 1.20, okay?\n\n180\n00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:54.220\nI can type in my subnet mask if I know\nwhat the subnet mask is, all right?\n\n181\n00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.900\nWhat is my subnet mask?\n\n182\n00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:56.540\nI don't know.\n\n183\n00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.200\nI have to go look at the server or\ncheck my documentation.\n\n184\n00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.060\nI'm pretty sure it's 255.255.255.0,\nso I'll put that in there.\n\n185\n00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.180\nBut I could be making a mistake.\n\n186\n00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.720\nWho is my router?\n\n187\n00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.620\nI don't know.\n\n188\n00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.450\nI think it's .2 but I could be wrong but\nI'll go ahead and put it in there.\n\n189\n00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.540\nThis is the problem with a human\nentering this data in is that you\n\n190\n00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.870\nhave to know the information.\n\n191\n00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.550\nAnd if you're not certain you\ncould be making a mistake.\n\n192\n00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.890\nAll right?\n\n193\n00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.810\nI'm also gonna go into advanced\nbecause I need to set DNS servers.\n\n194\n00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.670\nI can't do name lookups unless\nI have a DNS server, right?\n\n195\n00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.670\nSo I need to go in,\nput that in too, right?\n\n196\n00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.280\nWe just gotta get all this\ninformation in here so\n\n197\n00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.140\nthat we'll be able to\ncommunicate on the network.\n\n198\n00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.920\nAnd when that's all done I can apply it\nand my adapter changes from yellow to\n\n199\n00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.130\ngreen cuz I now have a valid address or\nat least what it thinks is valid.\n\n200\n00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.170\nIt's only as valid as\nthe information you give it.\n\n201\n00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.930\nBut assuming that I got it all right,\n\n202\n00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.630\nI should be able to fire\nup my Network Utility.\n\n203\n00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.550\nI can see that new address right there.\n\n204\n00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:55.090\nI can go to Ping, and\nI can try to ping that server.\n\n205\n00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.220\nAnd this time I can communicate, right?\n\n206\n00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.210\nBut I had to know the data,\nand I had to do it myself.\n\n207\n00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.600\nI had to go in and configure that, right?\n\n208\n00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.680\nAnd, you can certainly\nmake your users do that.\n\n209\n00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.350\nIt didn't require administrative\nprivileges to change an IP,\n\n210\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.160\nanybody can do it.\n\n211\n00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.285\nBut you have to know the information.\n\n212\n00:10:10.285 --> 00:10:14.075\nSo wouldn't it be nice if it\nwas just automatic, right?\n\n213\n00:10:14.075 --> 00:10:15.855\nAnd that's what DHCP is all about.\n\n214\n00:10:15.855 --> 00:10:18.065\nDHCP is about making it automatic.\n\n215\n00:10:18.065 --> 00:10:21.345\nThe default setting on your MAC\nnetwork adapters is will be\n\n216\n00:10:21.345 --> 00:10:25.395\nto use DHCP instead of manual\nthey will be set to use DHCP.\n\n217\n00:10:25.395 --> 00:10:27.605\nSo I'm going to set that, all right?\n\n218\n00:10:27.605 --> 00:10:30.665\nAnd when I apply it,\nit's going to start checking the network.\n\n219\n00:10:30.665 --> 00:10:32.860\nNow notice how my DNS settings stayed?\n\n220\n00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.090\nThe DNS settings are separate and\nso if I want to use those automatic\n\n221\n00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.220\ntoo I need to go and\ndelete the settings I've put in there.\n\n222\n00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.790\nSo I'm gonna remove that server and now\nit's gonna try and use DHCP for that too.\n\n223\n00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.790\nAll right, so one extra little step.\n\n224\n00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.830\nSo now it's gonna try and\nautomatically get an address.\n\n225\n00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:47.395\nAll right.\n\n226\n00:10:47.395 --> 00:10:51.779\nWhat's happening in the background is\nwhat's called, the DHCP handshake.\n\n227\n00:10:51.779 --> 00:10:53.262\nAnd it works in four steps.\n\n228\n00:10:53.262 --> 00:10:55.383\nWes, actually has a little pneumonic.\n\n229\n00:10:55.383 --> 00:10:57.151\nWhat's the pneumonic you use?\n\n230\n00:10:57.151 --> 00:11:00.333\n>> That's DORA, discover,\noffer, request, and acknowledge.\n\n231\n00:11:00.333 --> 00:11:02.241\n>> All right so, step one is discover.\n\n232\n00:11:02.241 --> 00:11:05.984\nMy Mac plugs in to a new network and\nit says, boy I need a new address.\n\n233\n00:11:05.984 --> 00:11:08.090\nPlease somebody help me.\n\n234\n00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.320\nThat's discovery.\n\n235\n00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.470\nWe're sending a message out\njust to anybody on the network,\n\n236\n00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.330\nsomebody help, right?\n\n237\n00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.120\nSo D is for discovery.\n\n238\n00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.130\nThen we have O for offer.\n\n239\n00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:21.950\nA DHCP on the network will\nhear that discover message and\n\n240\n00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.830\nreply back with an offer.\n\n241\n00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.830\nThey'll say, hey,\nI've got an address right here.\n\n242\n00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:26.380\nYou can have it.\n\n243\n00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.300\nAnd they'll offer it to the client.\n\n244\n00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.550\nThe client receives it.\n\n245\n00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.550\nAnd if the client likes it, it says, yeah,\nthat's a good address, I wanna use it.\n\n246\n00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.200\nThen we move to R, right.\n\n247\n00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.080\nAt R's request,\n\n248\n00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.390\nthe client will then say, okay,\nI would like to request that address.\n\n249\n00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:41.520\nI wanna use it.\n\n250\n00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.990\nI know it's weird we're requesting\nit after it's been offered.\n\n251\n00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.090\nBut we're really requesting to say\ncan we have it for a long time.\n\n252\n00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:51.350\nAnd the server is then going to\ncome back with an acknowledgement,\n\n253\n00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:55.420\nthe A for acknowledgement, to say, yes,\nyou can have it for this amount of time.\n\n254\n00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.260\nAnd that is where it will\nset what's called a lease.\n\n255\n00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.440\nYou lease the address.\n\n256\n00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.360\nWe don't have to make payments or\nanything, but\n\n257\n00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.370\nyou get a certain amount of time.\n\n258\n00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.860\nI equate it more to like\nchecking out a library book.\n\n259\n00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.230\nThat hey, I get this address for a week.\n\n260\n00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.710\nAnd at the end of the week\nI've got a choice.\n\n261\n00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.760\nI can either turn it back in,\nor I can renew it and\n\n262\n00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.280\nI can keep it for another week.\n\n263\n00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.670\nAnd then I can renew and\nkeep it for another.\n\n264\n00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.100\nSo you can renew it over and over and\nover again, keep that same address for\n\n265\n00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.530\na long, long time.\n\n266\n00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:24.390\nBut if I turn my computer off and I leave\nthe building eventually my lease ends, and\n\n267\n00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.730\nthat address can be given\nto somebody else, right?\n\n268\n00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.490\nSo i only have the address temporarily.\n\n269\n00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.180\nI don't own it,\nI'm just kind of borrowing it.\n\n270\n00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.070\nIt's a lease.\n\n271\n00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.720\nBut right now I don't have a DHCP server.\n\n272\n00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.040\nSo what did it do?\n\n273\n00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.140\nIt made up an address.\n\n274\n00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.330\nJust picked one out of it's head,\nand that's what it's got.\n\n275\n00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.440\nAnd that's not going to work,\nnow I can't see the server any more.\n\n276\n00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.170\nAll right.\n\n277\n00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.590\nSo what we're gonna do next is\nwe're gonna set up that server so\n\n278\n00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:47.570\nthat it can be a DHCP server.\n\n279\n00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:51.920\nThis is my OS10 server and if I look\ndown the list of services over here,\n\n280\n00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.860\nI don't see DHCP and that's because\nit's tucked away under advanced.\n\n281\n00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.240\nAnd if we go under advanced,\nyou'll find DHCP right there, and\n\n282\n00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.140\nwe can configure a DHCP server.\n\n283\n00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.510\nThere's not a tonne of options here.\n\n284\n00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.920\nOne that you'll notice is missing\nright away, is the permissions button.\n\n285\n00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.460\nWe've seen the permissions button on\nevery single service in this show\n\n286\n00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.490\nup until this point.\n\n287\n00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:14.960\nThis is the first one that didn't have it.\n\n288\n00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.920\nAll right.\n\n289\n00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.720\nWhy doesn't it have permissions?\n\n290\n00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.880\nThe reason is, this happened so\nearly on in the communication,\n\n291\n00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.230\nthe Mac just plugged into network,\nit doesn't even have an address to talk.\n\n292\n00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.330\nSo we have no way to really identify it.\n\n293\n00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.720\nwe can't identify what you user is on\nit or whether they provided a password,\n\n294\n00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.880\nwhether they're bound\nto the open directory.\n\n295\n00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.960\nWe can't even verify if they're on\nthe right sub net because they don't have\n\n296\n00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.000\nan address yet so\nthere's no way to filter permissions.\n\n297\n00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.860\nThere actually is one way but\napple doesn't support it so\n\n298\n00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.020\nthat's why we don't have the button.\n\n299\n00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.580\nSo, we don't see that.\n\n300\n00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:50.290\nAll we see is the ability to\ncreate networks, all right?\n\n301\n00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:54.910\nAnd the server app will automatically\ncreate one network for you.\n\n302\n00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:57.130\nIt may or\nmay not match your actual network though.\n\n303\n00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:01.810\nYou'll notice mine is 190.168.0 because\nthat was an IP the server used to have.\n\n304\n00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.040\nI'm now in the 192,\nI want 168, that one network.\n\n305\n00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.190\nSo this isn't right.\n\n306\n00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.250\nSo if that happens,\nthe best thing to do is to delete it.\n\n307\n00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.350\nI could edit this network and change it,\nbut I'm just going to delete it.\n\n308\n00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.110\nAnd that way I can recreate it and\nmake sure it's the right network.\n\n309\n00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.720\nOK?\n\n310\n00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.400\nIf it matches, certainly stick with it.\n\n311\n00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.470\nIt saves you a little time.\n\n312\n00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:18.760\nIf it doesn't match just delete it.\n\n313\n00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.210\nIt's easy enough to recreate.\n\n314\n00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:23.400\nalright, now what we're going to do is\nwe're going to create what's called\n\n315\n00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.110\nthe DHCP database.\n\n316\n00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:28.490\nThe DHCP database is a pool of IP\n\n317\n00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:32.670\naddresses that we can lend out to people\nso we're going to give it a range of IPs.\n\n318\n00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:36.570\nAnd not just IPs,\nwe can give out a lot of other stuff too.\n\n319\n00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.520\nLike, what DNS servers to use,\nwhat routers to use.\n\n320\n00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.660\nYou could even do like Voice over IP\nconfigurations there's all sorts of crazy\n\n321\n00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.900\nthings that you can handle with DHCP,\n\n322\n00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.670\nwe need to be able to tell\npeople that information.\n\n323\n00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:54.820\nThe two primary ones are going\nto be the router's address and\n\n324\n00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.070\nthe name server's address.\n\n325\n00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:57.610\nRight?\nThose are kind of the two main things that\n\n326\n00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:58.560\nwe want to give out.\n\n327\n00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.030\nSo when I go to add this,\nit's gonna ask me some\n\n328\n00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:06.080\ncritical things that are focused on\nthose key pieces of information.\n\n329\n00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.870\nUnderstand that there are other options.\n\n330\n00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.070\nbut these are kind of the key ones.\n\n331\n00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.800\nSo let's walk through each of these.\n\n332\n00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.500\nThe first one is just a name.\n\n333\n00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.240\nI might have more than one network.\n\n334\n00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.840\nAnd so\nI just need to give this network a name.\n\n335\n00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.100\nIf you have more than one\nadapter in your server,\n\n336\n00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.150\nyou can point it at more than one\nnetwork and issue out those addresses.\n\n337\n00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.850\nThat's not a very common configuration.\n\n338\n00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.200\nSo I'm just going to\ncall this ITProTV Lab.\n\n339\n00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.180\nAnd I can set my lease duration.\n\n340\n00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.010\nHow long do I want it to be?\n\n341\n00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:33.000\nAnd you've got a few choices, one hour,\none day, seven days, 30 days.\n\n342\n00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:33.710\nRight.\n\n343\n00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.030\nNow the choice here is entirely up to you.\n\n344\n00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:40.746\nThe longer you pick, the less load\nit creates on a server, right?\n\n345\n00:15:40.746 --> 00:15:45.306\nIf I pick one hour, a client's\ngonna connect, and then when 50% of\n\n346\n00:15:45.306 --> 00:15:50.275\ntheir lease is up, when half their\nlease is up, they're gonna go to renew.\n\n347\n00:15:50.275 --> 00:15:52.176\nThey always try to renew halfway.\n\n348\n00:15:52.176 --> 00:15:55.994\nSo every 30 minutes\npeople are gonna renew.\n\n349\n00:15:55.994 --> 00:15:58.316\nIf I have ten computers,\nthat's not a big deal.\n\n350\n00:15:58.316 --> 00:16:03.307\nIf I have 10,000 computers, every 30\nminutes 10,000 computers are phoning home.\n\n351\n00:16:03.307 --> 00:16:06.450\nAnd they're not gonna doing it at exactly\nsame thing, but it's a lot of traffic.\n\n352\n00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.060\nYour server's gonna be busy\nhandling those renewals.\n\n353\n00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:15.690\nSo, if I have 10,000 computers, I might\nwanna go, 1 day, 7 days even 30 days.\n\n354\n00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:16.552\nIf I go 30 days,\n\n355\n00:16:16.552 --> 00:16:21.116\nnow those 10,000 computers are gonna be\nspread out over a 15-day interval, right?\n\n356\n00:16:21.116 --> 00:16:22.230\nBecause it's 50%.\n\n357\n00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.138\nSo every two weeks people are phoning in.\n\n358\n00:16:24.138 --> 00:16:26.100\nAnd that's not such a big deal anymore.\n\n359\n00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:30.090\nSo the longer the lease, the less of\na burden it places on the server.\n\n360\n00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.270\nBut there is a slight problem with this.\n\n361\n00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:37.692\nIf I have static machines, if I have\ndesktops that are always in the building\n\n362\n00:16:37.692 --> 00:16:40.410\nthat's fine, but\nwhat if I have a lot of laptops?\n\n363\n00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.500\nPeople come and go, right?\n\n364\n00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.400\nI could run out of IP addresses.\n\n365\n00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.822\nIf I run out of IP addresses, there could\nbe somebody who's laptop is turned off and\n\n366\n00:16:48.822 --> 00:16:51.790\nout of the building, and\nthey're still holding an address that I\n\n367\n00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.435\ncould be giving to\nsomebody else right now.\n\n368\n00:16:53.435 --> 00:16:58.294\nSo if I have an environment where people\nare constantly bringing computers in and\n\n369\n00:16:58.294 --> 00:17:00.947\nout all the time, like Starbucks, right?\n\n370\n00:17:00.947 --> 00:17:03.183\nIf you go to the coffee shop and\nuse their wireless,\n\n371\n00:17:03.183 --> 00:17:05.750\nhow long do you spend at the coffee shop?\n\n372\n00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.914\nMost people are only there 15 minutes,\nright?\n\n373\n00:17:07.914 --> 00:17:10.800\nOr however long it takes to get\nthat overpriced cup of coffee.\n\n374\n00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.780\nMaybe you sit down and\nread a book for a little bit,\n\n375\n00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.460\nyou might be there an hour, but\nat the end of that hour, you leave.\n\n376\n00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.830\nAnd now, you're not coming back until\nthe next day or the next week, or\n\n377\n00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:20.730\nmaybe you don't come back at all.\n\n378\n00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.870\nMaybe it was a terrible cup of coffee,\nright?\n\n379\n00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:25.085\nWell, you wouldn't want a person\nto hold onto that address for\n\n380\n00:17:25.085 --> 00:17:27.650\n30 days,\nthey've already left the building.\n\n381\n00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.215\nWe can give that address to somebody else.\n\n382\n00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:32.959\nSo, in a place we have a lot mobile\ndevices, where they're coming and going,\n\n383\n00:17:32.959 --> 00:17:36.397\nyou'll wanna shorter lease so\nthat you don't run out of IP addresses.\n\n384\n00:17:36.397 --> 00:17:39.511\nNow the reality is,\nmost of us use fake addresses anyway, so\n\n385\n00:17:39.511 --> 00:17:42.026\nyou could create a really\nbig pool if you wanted.\n\n386\n00:17:42.026 --> 00:17:45.575\nBut the shorter lease time\nallows us to use less IPs.\n\n387\n00:17:45.575 --> 00:17:47.420\nSo that's how I make that decision.\n\n388\n00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:53.510\nIf I have a ton of machines that are\nalways there, I go for long lease times.\n\n389\n00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.400\nIf I have a handful of machines but\nthey're constantly coming and going,\n\n390\n00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.810\nthen then we go to short lease time.\n\n391\n00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.635\nSo you gotta kinda pick what's right for\nyou.\n\n392\n00:17:59.635 --> 00:18:01.230\nAnd you can always change\nthis after the fact.\n\n393\n00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.102\nIt's not a big deal to change it.\n\n394\n00:18:03.102 --> 00:18:07.845\nAll right, so we'll go 1 day,\nso 24 hours from my leases.\n\n395\n00:18:07.845 --> 00:18:09.452\nThen the interface.\n\n396\n00:18:09.452 --> 00:18:11.805\nRemember I said if you had more\nthan one network interface,\n\n397\n00:18:11.805 --> 00:18:14.190\nyou can be providing DHCP for\nmore than one network?\n\n398\n00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.461\nSo I can pick which network it\nis that I'm providing DHCP for.\n\n399\n00:18:18.461 --> 00:18:19.910\nThen the pool.\n\n400\n00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:24.290\nThe pool has a start and an end, so\nthe first address to the last address.\n\n401\n00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:29.095\nI'm gonna issue, let's do 192.168.1.200.\n\n402\n00:18:29.095 --> 00:18:32.835\nI'll start with 201, and\nI'll go all the way to 250.\n\n403\n00:18:32.835 --> 00:18:35.483\nI'm making these numbers up,\njust the top of my head.\n\n404\n00:18:35.483 --> 00:18:38.985\nThat's gonna give me 50 IP\naddresses in this pool.\n\n405\n00:18:38.985 --> 00:18:42.585\nSo, if I have 50 computers,\nthey'll all be able to get an address.\n\n406\n00:18:42.585 --> 00:18:47.564\nIf I have 51 computers, the 51st person\nis gonna make up there own APIPA address,\n\n407\n00:18:47.564 --> 00:18:49.417\nand it's not gonna work.\n\n408\n00:18:49.417 --> 00:18:53.102\nSo, I just have to be aware that I need to\naccount for the amount of machines I have.\n\n409\n00:18:53.102 --> 00:18:55.886\nAs well as visitors, guests,\npeople that come and go,\n\n410\n00:18:55.886 --> 00:18:57.980\nthey're gonna occupy IP addresses too.\n\n411\n00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.220\nSo make sure you set\naside enough addresses.\n\n412\n00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.156\nThen my Subnet Mask, right?\n\n413\n00:19:03.156 --> 00:19:05.230\nFor whatever my subnet happens to be.\n\n414\n00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:09.245\nIf you're using a 192.168 type address,\nit'll be 255.255.255.0.\n\n415\n00:19:09.245 --> 00:19:15.754\nBut if you're using a 172.16 or 10.,\nit might be something different.\n\n416\n00:19:15.754 --> 00:19:18.820\nSo make sure you put in\nthe appropriate subnet mask.\n\n417\n00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.800\nAnd then lastly, your router, right?\n\n418\n00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.940\nWho is the router that\nyou're going to use?\n\n419\n00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.370\nNow, we're the network admins?\n\n420\n00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.240\nWe know this information.\n\n421\n00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.610\nWe can put it in here and\nmake sure it's correct.\n\n422\n00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:30.622\nBut all the computers that connect,\nthey don't have to know this.\n\n423\n00:19:30.622 --> 00:19:34.140\nWe're gonna tell them so there won't\nbe typos, we don't have to remember.\n\n424\n00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.580\nThey'll all figure it out and\nget it put in.\n\n425\n00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.450\nSo I'll just leave that\nat what it's set to.\n\n426\n00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.680\nNow as far as DNS,\nI'll probably wanna edit those values.\n\n427\n00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.760\nAnd I can specify the DNS servers to use.\n\n428\n00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.970\nNow if I have Open Directory, I wanna\nmake sure I put in one of my DNS servers.\n\n429\n00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:52.690\nBut if I don't have Open Directory\nthen I might wanna just put it in some\n\n430\n00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:53.820\npublic DNS servers.\n\n431\n00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.990\nIt's up to me, whatever it is that\nI need to support my network.\n\n432\n00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.530\nI can punch those all in.\n\n433\n00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:02.030\nOkay, and then the same thing\nwith the search domains.\n\n434\n00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.503\nI might have however many search domains.\n\n435\n00:20:04.503 --> 00:20:06.930\nI might have lab.itpro.tv.\n\n436\n00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:12.155\nI might have, let's see,\nplain old itpro.tv.\n\n437\n00:20:12.155 --> 00:20:16.410\nWhatever it is that you want for your\nsearch domains, that will punch those in.\n\n438\n00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.390\nWe covered all of those\nin the DNS episodes.\n\n439\n00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:21.800\nAll right, so we'll get those\nkinda punched in and in place.\n\n440\n00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.590\nSo now whenever somebody comes to me and\n\n441\n00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:29.120\nrequests an address, I've got a pool\nof addresses I can give out and\n\n442\n00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.880\nother configuration settings\nthat go along with them.\n\n443\n00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:37.284\nAll right, so I'll go ahead and hit\nCreate, and that's gonna build that pool.\n\n444\n00:20:37.284 --> 00:20:39.150\nNow, what about all\nthe other custom options?\n\n445\n00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.690\nWhat if I wanna do voice over IP\ntype stuff and things like that?\n\n446\n00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.830\nWell, the graphical user interface\ndoesn't include options for that,\n\n447\n00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.250\nI can't configure it.\n\n448\n00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.360\nBut the config files\nare stored on the hard drive.\n\n449\n00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:53.080\nIt's in /library/server/DHCP, and\nthe configures are tucked away in there.\n\n450\n00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.090\nAnd you can go in and\nedit those files directly but\n\n451\n00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.060\nyou have to do it from the command line,\nthey don't support it through the GUI.\n\n452\n00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.336\nAnd they won't hit on that on the exam,\nbut in real life if you need to do it,\n\n453\n00:21:01.336 --> 00:21:02.898\nyou can do it from the command line.\n\n454\n00:21:02.898 --> 00:21:07.290\nUnder the hood it's just the standard\nUnix DHCP server, it's not anything magic.\n\n455\n00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:10.589\nApple's just given us a nice UI\nto make it easier to work with.\n\n456\n00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.910\nAll right, but\nat this point I am a DHCP server.\n\n457\n00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:17.110\nSo if somebody starts to request\naddresses, I'll respond.\n\n458\n00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.490\nWell, assuming I remember\nto hit this On button.\n\n459\n00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.290\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nhit the On button.\n\n460\n00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:22.880\nSo now I'm a DHCP server.\n\n461\n00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:26.550\nOkay, so I'm gonna start offering\naddresses out on the network and\n\n462\n00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:27.620\npeople will get those.\n\n463\n00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.020\nSo let's jump back to my client over here,\nthis guy.\n\n464\n00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.800\nThis guy made up his own\naddress a few minutes ago.\n\n465\n00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.420\nAnd if I go into the network now and\n\n466\n00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:38.270\ntake a look at it,\nsee how it flipped real fast?\n\n467\n00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:41.610\nThat was probably hard to see, but it was\nautomatic and then it flipped to DHCP.\n\n468\n00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:45.280\nWhen you make up an address, you don't\njust make it up and then give up.\n\n469\n00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.760\nIt continually looks for\nDHCP servers in the background.\n\n470\n00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.850\nAnd so, while we were away,\nit kept watching, and\n\n471\n00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:53.930\nit saw it the moment I\nturned that DHCP server on.\n\n472\n00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:55.974\nAnd it requested an address and\nit got one.\n\n473\n00:21:55.974 --> 00:22:01.520\n192.168.1.201, the first\naddress in my pool.\n\n474\n00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.720\nAnd so it grabbed an address.\n\n475\n00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.810\nAnd it's got the subnet mask and\nthe router.\n\n476\n00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:09.870\nAnd it's got the DNS servers and the DNS\nsearch domains, they're all right there.\n\n477\n00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:12.300\nIt's pulled all that from my server.\n\n478\n00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.500\n>> All right Don, let me see if I\ncan break your network, all right?\n\n479\n00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.242\nSo, you mentioned in the DORA process,\nright?\n\n480\n00:22:18.242 --> 00:22:19.276\nThe discovery packet, right?\n\n481\n00:22:19.276 --> 00:22:22.516\nThat's like getting up on the table and\nyelling out to the whole entire courtyard,\n\n482\n00:22:22.516 --> 00:22:23.500\nhey, what's going on?\n\n483\n00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.580\nI need an IP address.\n\n484\n00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.390\nWell, if that goes to everybody, knowing\na little bit about the routing process,\n\n485\n00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:33.050\nhow am I gonna do that if I've got\na DHCP that's on another subnet?\n\n486\n00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:37.010\nSeeing that the routers themselves, they\ndon't seem to pass that broadcast traffic\n\n487\n00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:39.710\nthat means, well, they're not\ngonna get any IP addresses, right?\n\n488\n00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:42.160\n>> Yeah, you gotta do one of two things.\n\n489\n00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.999\nIf you have more than one subnet the DHP\ndiscovery messages do not pass through\n\n490\n00:22:46.999 --> 00:22:47.677\nrouters.\n\n491\n00:22:47.677 --> 00:22:49.715\nRouters kill off those,\ncuz they're broadcast and\n\n492\n00:22:49.715 --> 00:22:51.230\nrouters don't forward broadcasts.\n\n493\n00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.220\nThat's how that works, kinda like Bonjour.\n\n494\n00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.430\nBonjour doesn't spread through\nyour router, neither does this.\n\n495\n00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:56.860\nThey all work on broadcast.\n\n496\n00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.730\nSo, your two solutions,\n\n497\n00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:01.950\nsolution one is put in more than\none network adapter on DHCP server.\n\n498\n00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.330\nYou can have one adapter that\nconnects to one network and\n\n499\n00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:05.400\none adapter that connects to the other.\n\n500\n00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.800\nSo now you can serve up those\nanswers on both networks.\n\n501\n00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:15.250\nThe other option though is, a lot of\nrouters support what's called DHCP relay.\n\n502\n00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:19.570\nDHCP relay says, if they hear\na DHCP request on one network,\n\n503\n00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:22.520\nthey can forward it to a DHCP\nserver on another network.\n\n504\n00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.120\nThat's not a part of your Mac,\nthat's a part of your router.\n\n505\n00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.203\nSo you'll have to look at your router's\ndocumentation to see if it supports that.\n\n506\n00:23:28.203 --> 00:23:31.230\nOn most routers it's called, DHCP relay.\n\n507\n00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.810\nCisco likes to call it\nan IP helper address.\n\n508\n00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.260\nI don't know why they call it,\nthat but that is what they call it.\n\n509\n00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.610\nAnd so different vendors might\nhave different names for it.\n\n510\n00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:41.950\nBut it all centers around\nforwarding those DHCP requests.\n\n511\n00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:46.048\n>> All right, well I tried to break the D\nin Dora here, it didn't work too well.\n\n512\n00:23:46.048 --> 00:23:47.654\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So now I'm gonna go to the O and\n\n513\n00:23:47.654 --> 00:23:50.183\nsee if I can't break the O in\nthe Dora process, all right?\n\n514\n00:23:50.183 --> 00:23:53.341\nMaybe some of you out there have gotten\nmultiple offer letters at the same\n\n515\n00:23:53.341 --> 00:23:54.030\ntime, right?\n\n516\n00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:56.060\nYour criteria is, well,\nwho's gonna pay me more?\n\n517\n00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.430\nAnd that's gonna be the one I choose.\n\n518\n00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:01.792\nWell, I know there's probably a potential\nfor there to be multiple DHCP servers on\n\n519\n00:24:01.792 --> 00:24:04.600\na single network, and\nI've got multiple offers.\n\n520\n00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.630\nWhat's going to happen?\n\n521\n00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.990\n>> All right, so you could have\nmore than one DHCP server, and\n\n522\n00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.990\nthere's a reason for that.\n\n523\n00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.630\nIt could be an accident, you might not\nwant it, but you might want it for\n\n524\n00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:13.810\nredundancy.\n\n525\n00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:16.350\nWhat happens if my DHCP server fails?\n\n526\n00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:17.450\nNow nobody can get addresses.\n\n527\n00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:20.250\nNow, they might have a leased address\nalready, but whenever their lease\n\n528\n00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.730\nruns out, now they don't have an address,\nand so my network breaks.\n\n529\n00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:26.110\nThe DHCP server's almost like\na central point of failure.\n\n530\n00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.710\nWe don't want that, right?\n\n531\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:31.830\nSo you might have two DHCP servers so if\none fails, the other one's still running.\n\n532\n00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:35.410\nNow if you do that, they need to\nhave two different pools, right?\n\n533\n00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:37.780\nSo my pool was 201 through 250.\n\n534\n00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:40.540\nSo I might have another DHCP server.\n\n535\n00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.020\nThat's 151 to 200, right?\n\n536\n00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:45.460\nThey're in the same subnet,\nbut they don't overlap,\n\n537\n00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.280\nthat way they can issue out those\naddresses without duplicates because\n\n538\n00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.920\nthey don't do duplicate checking between\neach other, so you got to remember that.\n\n539\n00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.050\nMake sure the pulls don't overlap.\n\n540\n00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.810\nBut as soon as I have two of those servers\nthat are up, when a client sends out\n\n541\n00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:02.400\na discover, just like Wes said, we're\ngoing to get offers from both servers.\n\n542\n00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.705\nBoth servers will offer to us.\n\n543\n00:25:03.705 --> 00:25:06.450\nAnd what's going to happen is your client\n\n544\n00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:11.690\nis going to do a request on the first one\nit receives, so whoever it gets first.\n\n545\n00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:13.900\nRemember on an ethernet cable,\n\n546\n00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.540\nif two communications happen on the cable\nat the same time you get a collision.\n\n547\n00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.040\nSo your network switches prevent that,\nthey divide it up and set it so\n\n548\n00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.660\nthat one happens before the other.\n\n549\n00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:26.300\nSo you'll never get two offers at\nexactly the same time, it's impossible.\n\n550\n00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.440\nThe data will be corrupt.\n\n551\n00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.330\nSo you're always going to get one offer\nfirst, and the other offer second,\n\n552\n00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:35.230\nthey might be nanoseconds apart,\nbut they'll always be separate.\n\n553\n00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:39.560\nYou'll accept the first one, the other\none, you just ignore, you throw it away.\n\n554\n00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.210\nYou're like yeah, whatever,\nyou throw it away, all right.\n\n555\n00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:47.100\nAnd that second DACP server will\nhold that offer for a certain timer.\n\n556\n00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:50.140\nThe timer on most servers is 90 seconds,\nbut it could be shorter or\n\n557\n00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.800\nlonger, because it's customizable.\n\n558\n00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.840\nBut it'll wait for a little while, and\n\n559\n00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.970\nif it doesn't get a request back, after\na little while it says, you know what?\n\n560\n00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.010\nI'm taking that back,\nI didn't want to give it to you anyway.\n\n561\n00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.300\nYou know, sour grapes thing.\n\n562\n00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.020\nAnd said, I'll give it to somebody else,\nsomebody more deserving.\n\n563\n00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.150\nAnd that's what it does.\n\n564\n00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:10.645\nSo, you might get more than one request,\nAnd the DHCP servers are okay with that.\n\n565\n00:26:10.645 --> 00:26:12.255\nThey know you're going to pick one, and\n\n566\n00:26:12.255 --> 00:26:15.495\nthe others will just hold on to that\naddress to give to somebody else later.\n\n567\n00:26:15.495 --> 00:26:18.095\n>> All right, well for\nme, now we've got Don two,\n\n568\n00:26:18.095 --> 00:26:20.855\nWest zero, I got to try to get\nsome points up on the board here.\n\n569\n00:26:20.855 --> 00:26:22.245\nSo I've got another scenario.\n\n570\n00:26:22.245 --> 00:26:27.005\nLet's say that we've deployed some\nmaybe older TCP/IP based printers here.\n\n571\n00:26:27.005 --> 00:26:30.320\nMaybe I'm going to break your\nabilities to use AirPrint.\n\n572\n00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.230\nRight, we don't have AirPrint,\nmaybe they don't support Bonjour.\n\n573\n00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:37.010\n>> But what happens if an IP address,\nif we're using DHCP for\n\n574\n00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:39.120\nthose printers, and\nthe IP address changes.\n\n575\n00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.290\nDo I have to turn around and go back and\n\n576\n00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:44.110\nmap all the IP addresses Do\nwe have a solution in DHCP?\n\n577\n00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.010\n>> Yeah,\nyour printers are a great example that.\n\n578\n00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:50.100\nThose little menus on a printer to go in\nand configure things, it's a nightmare.\n\n579\n00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.910\nIt's really hard to to go in and\nset those things.\n\n580\n00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:53.060\nSo using DHCP for\n\n581\n00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.180\na printer is nice, because you don't\nhave to configure the network.\n\n582\n00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.610\nBut you always want your printer\nto have the same IP address so\n\n583\n00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:58.790\nyou can reliably find it.\n\n584\n00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:01.700\nSo with DHCP, that is not a guarantee.\n\n585\n00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.740\nYou are not guaranteed to\nalways have the same address.\n\n586\n00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.035\nIf your lease expires,\nyou could get a new address and\n\n587\n00:27:06.035 --> 00:27:09.250\nnow you've got to remap all the printers,\nlike Wes said.\n\n588\n00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:13.120\nSo what we can do is we can set\nup what's called a reservation.\n\n589\n00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.050\nA reservation is where you take one IP and\nyou reserve it, you set it aside.\n\n590\n00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:20.240\nAnd you say this is available just for\nthis It's one client.\n\n591\n00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.060\nAnd we can do that right here in\nthe server app, let me show you.\n\n592\n00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:27.770\nSo here my client just got the address on\nits own, but if I go back to my server and\n\n593\n00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:31.180\nI go to the clients tab,\nI can see all the addresses that I issued.\n\n594\n00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.800\nAnd so here's Don's Mac.\n\n595\n00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.240\nDon's Mac got 192.168.1.201 and\nit was dynamic.\n\n596\n00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.700\nI just asked for it and it gave it to me.\n\n597\n00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.500\nOkay?\n\n598\n00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.780\nSo that's coming right\nout of that lab network.\n\n599\n00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:47.380\nWell, when I highlight that client down\nat the bottom you can hit the gear and\n\n600\n00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.130\nyou'll see, View Client, which will\njust like browse through it that's not\n\n601\n00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:53.510\nexciting, and create static address.\n\n602\n00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:56.310\nCreating a static address\ncreates a reservation.\n\n603\n00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:59.950\nIt reserves that IP and\nholds it for this one client.\n\n604\n00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:03.650\nNo one else will be allowed\nto use this IP address.\n\n605\n00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:06.350\nIt's going to map it to my MAC address.\n\n606\n00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:11.190\nAnd that's not Mac as in Macintosh,\nthat's MAC as in Media Access Control.\n\n607\n00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:15.860\nEvery network adapter, be it wireless or\nwired, be it in a Windows or\n\n608\n00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.880\nLinux or Mac machine, it doesn't matter.\n\n609\n00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.200\nEvery network adapter and\n\n610\n00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:24.060\nevery device that supports networking\nhas a media access control address.\n\n611\n00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:28.330\nIt's a hardware address that's\nburned into the hardware.\n\n612\n00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:31.900\nI guess redundant there, but\nit's a 48 bit hexadecimal number.\n\n613\n00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.920\nSo it looks something like this, and it's\ngoing to vary based on your device, so\n\n614\n00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:40.350\nyours may look wildly different than mine\nbut it'll be in the same format, right?\n\n615\n00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:45.540\nSo, when it sees a broadcast come\nfrom this Mac address, it'll look and\n\n616\n00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.150\nit'll say, this guy always get 201.\n\n617\n00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:49.880\nNobody else is allowed to get 201.\n\n618\n00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.800\nSo for a printer,\nthat's nice because we can have set and\n\n619\n00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.590\nnow we'll know that it will\nalways get that address.\n\n620\n00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:59.810\nAnd so now when I look,\nDons-Mac no longer shows as dynamic.\n\n621\n00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:01.090\nIt shows as static.\n\n622\n00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:03.350\nA static address is one\nthat's been manually set.\n\n623\n00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:05.700\nThis one's manually\nassigned to this client.\n\n624\n00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:06.950\nNobody else will get it.\n\n625\n00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:08.530\nNow I don't have a lease timer, right?\n\n626\n00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:13.320\nSo back here, when I got an address\nthrough DHCP, normally I have a lease.\n\n627\n00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.920\nNow, I technically still have a lease,\nbut I'll always have that address even if\n\n628\n00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.540\nmy lease expires,\nI don't have to worry about that anymore.\n\n629\n00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:23.070\nNow Don, theoretically,\nwhat if I have 50 servers and\n\n630\n00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:24.870\nI wanted to manage their IP addresses?\n\n631\n00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:26.760\nIt's kind of funny,\nwe've been setting them statically but\n\n632\n00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.810\nis there any way maybe I could\nimplement this on a server as well?\n\n633\n00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:33.410\n>> You could,\nI don't like to do that personally.\n\n634\n00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:37.360\nPersonally, on a server, I manually\nassign the IPs, that's what I do.\n\n635\n00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.820\nBut you could use the DACP\nserver with reservations.\n\n636\n00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:45.220\nThe risk there is if your DACP server\ngoes down, what happens to your servers?\n\n637\n00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.800\nWell, now they might lose their\naddress when their lease expires and\n\n638\n00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:49.650\nnow your servers go down.\n\n639\n00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:50.568\nYou don't want that.\n\n640\n00:29:50.568 --> 00:29:54.250\nSo if you're going to use DACP for\nyour server make sure,\n\n641\n00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:58.130\nmake doubly sure,\nthat you've got more than one DACPserver.\n\n642\n00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:02.260\nAnd remember how I said you don't want\nthe IP's to overlap on your DACP servers?\n\n643\n00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.720\nWell, reservations like these\nwould be the exception,\n\n644\n00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.340\nbecause you need the same\nreservation to be on both servers.\n\n645\n00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:11.060\nIt doesn't matter if I get two offers for\nthe same address, if I'm reserved for\n\n646\n00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.300\nthose, that's fine.\n\n647\n00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.550\nBut every time I create a reservation,\n\n648\n00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.970\nI would need to create it on\nboth servers to reflect that.\n\n649\n00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:17.580\nPersonally, I just don't like to do it.\n\n650\n00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.470\nI will tell you, there is some\nkind of convenience, though, for\n\n651\n00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:21.530\nusing DHCP even for servers.\n\n652\n00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:25.940\nLet's say that right now,\nI'm using Google's DNS servers, so\n\n653\n00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:29.450\nwhen I set up my pool,\nlet me go back to my pool here.\n\n654\n00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:36.300\nSo when I set up the pool, I define\nmy DNS servers To be Google's, right.\n\n655\n00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.870\nAnd let's say I have 10,000 computers,\nand they're all set that way.\n\n656\n00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.180\nAnd then one day I say, you know what,\nI don't want to use Google any more.\n\n657\n00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.740\nI'm setting up an open directory, so\n\n658\n00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.050\nI need to point everybody\nat my own DNS server.\n\n659\n00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:49.310\nNow I've got to go to 10,000 computers and\nremap them, right?\n\n660\n00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:50.900\nNot with DHCP.\n\n661\n00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:54.440\nWith DHCP I can change\nthe values right here.\n\n662\n00:30:54.440 --> 00:31:01.100\nAnd so I'm going to change that out\nto my own server, and now, the next\n\n663\n00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:06.350\ntime they renew their lease, they will get\nthe new DNS configurations, all right?\n\n664\n00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:09.310\nAnd so\nif I have a one day lease duration here,\n\n665\n00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:13.660\nright then within 12 hours,\neverybody is going to check in and\n\n666\n00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.890\neverybody is going to get the DNS, so\nI don't go touch a single computer.\n\n667\n00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:22.076\nSo I just made a change in one place,\nis going to affect all of my computers.\n\n668\n00:31:22.076 --> 00:31:25.310\nSo it's kind of nice to be able to do\nthat to be able to change those settings.\n\n669\n00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:29.380\nNow, on my computer back here,\nif I look I still have those DNS servers,\n\n670\n00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:33.735\nand I can really even go in here and\noverride it if I wanted to go crazy.\n\n671\n00:31:33.735 --> 00:31:36.405\nBut if I disconnect from the network, and\n\n672\n00:31:36.405 --> 00:31:41.065\nthen reconnect, then what's going to\nhappen is I'll get those new values.\n\n673\n00:31:41.065 --> 00:31:46.166\nAnd I can just flip here to manual or\neven off here, I'll turn it off.\n\n674\n00:31:46.166 --> 00:31:47.930\nSo I'm going to turn this adapter off,\n\n675\n00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:50.230\nand I'm just going to give it\na second here, so it's off.\n\n676\n00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:52.468\nAnd then when I turn it back on,\n\n677\n00:31:52.468 --> 00:31:56.070\nit's going to reach back out and\nupdate its lease.\n\n678\n00:31:56.070 --> 00:32:00.220\nI said it's at 50% of lease expiration,\nbut also every time you reboot, every time\n\n679\n00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.830\nyou lose your network connection and\nget it back, it'll try and renew.\n\n680\n00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:06.320\nAnd so it renewed, and\nlook at that DNS Server, right.\n\n681\n00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.550\nSo that happens automatically and\n\n682\n00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:12.120\nwe can make a change across our whole\nnetwork by changing it in just one place.\n\n683\n00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.900\nThat's a nice part about DHCP.\n\n684\n00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.660\n>> A lot of good options\nthere inside of DHCP.\n\n685\n00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:19.900\nDo keep in mind what Don showed us, it's\nwe've been talking about IP addresses,\n\n686\n00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.750\nbut remember host configurations,\na lot of things that you can do with DHCP.\n\n687\n00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:26.700\nSo get into the settings,\nfind out what you can do.\n\n688\n00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.760\nDon, I'm looking at the clock right\nnow and it looks like we are burning\n\n689\n00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.660\nthe batteries up of the clock, but before\nwe call it a day, got anything else?\n\n690\n00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:36.860\nThe only other thing that I think I didn't\nmention is if you ever have a problem with\n\n691\n00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:40.310\nDHCP, remember, it's got service\nlogs right in the server app.\n\n692\n00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:44.680\nSo if I go back into my server app and\nI go up here to Logs.\n\n693\n00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:49.320\nIn the Logs, we can come in here and Just\ndown at the bottom instead of system log,\n\n694\n00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.240\nI can go in here and find DHTP.\n\n695\n00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.420\nAnd so it's got a service log right here.\n\n696\n00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:59.991\nAnd it'll show you when people request\naddresses and we can even see happening.\n\n697\n00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:03.670\nRight there is DISCOVER,\nOFFER, REQUEST Acknowledge.\n\n698\n00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:08.260\nYou can see that whole process occurring\nright there and this is Don's Man.\n\n699\n00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:09.120\nI can see the address.\n\n700\n00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.230\nIt's a great place to\ngo to troubleshoot and\n\n701\n00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:13.740\nfind out what's going on if\nyou're having issues with DACP.\n\n702\n00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:17.160\n>> Well Don, as always, thank you for that\nwealth of knowledge that you've showed us\n\n703\n00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.060\nand we look forward to seeing\nmore in this series, but\n\n704\n00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.250\nit looks like we're going to go ahead and\nsign out here at IT Pro Tv.\n\n705\n00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:24.720\nI've been your host West Bryan.\n\n706\n00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.180\n>> And I'm Don Paset.\n\n707\n00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:32.490\n>> And, we'll se you next time.\n\n",

00:00:16.482\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:21.341\nin today's episode we're continuing\nthrough our OS X Server Essentials series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.341 --> 00:00:25.761\nAnd in this one we're gonna be looking\nat network services, specifically VPNs.\n\n6\n00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:28.640\nJoining me back in the studio today\nis none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.770\nDon, how are you doing today sir?\n\n8\n00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.450\n>> I'm doing spectacular Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.795\nI'm ready to dive in right back\nin to our network services.\n\n10\n00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:36.215\nAnd like Wess said,\nwe're going to be taking a look at VPN's,\n\n11\n00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:38.265\nwhich are Virtual Private Networks.\n\n12\n00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:43.245\nI want to start off with what the heck\na VPN is first, and then we're going\n\n13\n00:00:43.245 --> 00:00:49.060\nto see how we can use OS X Server, that's\nrunning the server app, as a VPN server.\n\n14\n00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.320\nSo first of all, what the heck\nis a virtual private network?\n\n15\n00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.330\nWell, if you have all of your computers,\nand your servers,\n\n16\n00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.570\nin the same building you probably don't\ncare about virtual private networks,\n\n17\n00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.130\nbecause you have a real private network.\n\n18\n00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.440\nYou have a real network between all of\nyour workstations and your servers.\n\n19\n00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.770\nAnd it's right there in your building,\neverything is fine.\n\n20\n00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.190\nAnd that's the way the computing\nworked for a long, long time.\n\n21\n00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.310\nUntil in the late 90s when the Internet\nreally became prevalent and\n\n22\n00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.080\nlaptops became prevalent.\n\n23\n00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.910\nNow you had people who would take their\ncomputers outside of your building, and\n\n24\n00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.640\nthey would go to hotels, or home, or\nconference rooms, or other offices and\n\n25\n00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.290\nthey would still expect to\naccess company resources.\n\n26\n00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.420\nNow in the early days you just told\nthem no, [LAUGH] you can't do that.\n\n27\n00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.950\nIf you're at a hotel you can access\nwhat's on your laptop and that's it.\n\n28\n00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.700\nIf you're at home you can access your\nhome stuff and not your work stuff.\n\n29\n00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.360\nYou don't give them a way to connect,\nbut now we got options.\n\n30\n00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.770\n>> Well Don,\nwhat would be really the big deal?\n\n31\n00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.730\nWhy would I even be concerned?\n\n32\n00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.030\nI'm in a hotel,\nI've got an internet connection,\n\n33\n00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.350\njust let me connect back into\nthe company's resources.\n\n34\n00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.020\n>> All right sure.\n\n35\n00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.120\nSo pretty much every business these\ndays are connected to an internet.\n\n36\n00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.460\nOur studios here are connected\nto the internet.\n\n37\n00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.920\nWhen I go home,\nI've got an internet connection at home.\n\n38\n00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.290\nSo if my home is connected to the\ninternet, and the internet is connected to\n\n39\n00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.020\nhear at the office,\nthen my home is connected to the office.\n\n40\n00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.020\nI'm already connected,\nwhy not just browse and access stuff?\n\n41\n00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.070\nThe problem is that in between part.\n\n42\n00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.500\nWhen you cross the internet,\n\n43\n00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.520\nwhen you pass from one location to another\nvia the internet, you pass through a lot\n\n44\n00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.580\nof other people's networks,\na lot of other system that are out there.\n\n45\n00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.350\nAnd can you trust those systems?\n\n46\n00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.930\nDo you even know who they are?\n\n47\n00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.370\nMost of the time you don't, right?\n\n48\n00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.530\nMost of the time,\nthis stuff is kind of invisible to us.\n\n49\n00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.760\nWe don't even see it happen.\n\n50\n00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.540\nSo, for example here,\nlet me take this client and I'll show you.\n\n51\n00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.900\nSo, or maybe not that client,\nlet's take this server.\n\n52\n00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.660\nSo, I'm gonna take this server and\nfire up the network utility.\n\n53\n00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.370\nAnd let's say that I want\nto go to Apple's web site.\n\n54\n00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.390\nSo if I go to Ping, and\nI'm going to ping www.apple.com.\n\n55\n00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.560\nAnd I'm going to hit the old Ping button.\n\n56\n00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.425\nSo I'm sending ping This out to Apple and\neach one is taking about 17 milliseconds.\n\n57\n00:02:54.425 --> 00:02:57.645\nSo, you're pretty short trip to\nget me straight over to Apple.\n\n58\n00:02:57.645 --> 00:02:59.045\nHere's Apple's IP.\n\n59\n00:02:59.045 --> 00:02:59.745\nGreat.\n\n60\n00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:00.685\nSo, that's it.\n\n61\n00:03:00.685 --> 00:03:02.142\nI talked to Apple.\n\n62\n00:03:02.142 --> 00:03:03.052\nBut I did.\n\n63\n00:03:03.052 --> 00:03:04.092\nWell I guess I did, right.\n\n64\n00:03:04.092 --> 00:03:07.252\nBut I talked to Apple and\na bunch of other people.\n\n65\n00:03:07.252 --> 00:03:08.152\nWho are those other people?\n\n66\n00:03:08.152 --> 00:03:09.372\nWe don't even see them here.\n\n67\n00:03:09.372 --> 00:03:12.572\nWell if you go to your trace route and\nyou do the same thing.\n\n68\n00:03:12.572 --> 00:03:15.396\nSo this time I'm gonna reach out\nto Apple but do a trace route.\n\n69\n00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:19.776\nThis is going to show me all\nthe networks that I passed through on\n\n70\n00:03:19.776 --> 00:03:24.396\nmy way to Apple and so I passed through\nmore than one system and shoot I forgot.\n\n71\n00:03:24.396 --> 00:03:27.586\nThis virtual machine has\na little firewall in the way.\n\n72\n00:03:27.586 --> 00:03:31.026\nLet me just use my actual desktop here and\nI'll show you on this one.\n\n73\n00:03:31.026 --> 00:03:36.266\nSo I will ping Apple.com like\nwe did just a moment ago right,\n\n74\n00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:39.960\nso I'm able to ping Apple And,\n150 milliseconds now.\n\n75\n00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.530\nVirtual machine got better performance.\n\n76\n00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.480\nBut if I go into a trace route to Apple,\nso\n\n77\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.070\nI'll just reach out to them,\nthere we go, that's what I wanted to see\n\n78\n00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.390\nNow you can see all of the stuff I\npass through on the way to Apple.\n\n79\n00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.260\nSo here is me 10.1.230.1 that's the router\na firewall right here in the IT TV Pro\n\n80\n00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.500\nstudio and then this a104 blah blah\nakamitechnologies that's Apple's website,\n\n81\n00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.880\nthey are hosted with akamite So me and\nthe person I was talking to and\n\n82\n00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.920\nin between are 11 other people.\n\n83\n00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.800\n11 other people, 11 other companies, whose\nequipment I jumped thru on my way there.\n\n84\n00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.970\nI don't know whose\nsomeone is companies are.\n\n85\n00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.110\nSome of my.\nI do a gru.\n\n86\n00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.330\nThat's Gainesville regional utilities,\nthat's who we get our Internet through.\n\n87\n00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.660\nSo I know them.\n\n88\n00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.250\nI know some people that work there.\n\n89\n00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.640\nI can call them up and talk to them right?\n\n90\n00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.850\nSo I trust them but then gru right\nat this hop hands me off to NTT.\n\n91\n00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000\nNTT is one of the big Internet\nbackbone's here in the United States, so\n\n92\n00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.690\nit's a big company, so\nthey are pretty trustworthy.\n\n93\n00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.270\nBut I don’t know a single\nperson that works there.\n\n94\n00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.210\nI don’t know anything about whether they\nsecure their network, whether they don’t.\n\n95\n00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.620\nI don’t know the first thing about it.\n\n96\n00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.300\nIn fact,\nI don’t even really know where they are.\n\n97\n00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.200\nI can guess, right?\n\n98\n00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.300\nThis one’s in Atlanta.\n\n99\n00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.280\nThis one’s in New York, right?\n\n100\n00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.610\nI’m guessing based on the name.\n\n101\n00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.970\nThe name could be completely wrong,\nfor all I know.\n\n102\n00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.630\nI don’t even know where that is.\n\n103\n00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.830\nThen we get to Akamai.\n\n104\n00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.470\nWell.\n\n105\n00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.780\nAkamai is not Apple.\n\n106\n00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.330\nI know that Apple hosts with Akamai.\n\n107\n00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.140\nWhat if I didn't know that?\n\n108\n00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.730\nI don't even know that that's Apple,\nright?\n\n109\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.210\nSo, anybody in between me and\n\n110\n00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.320\nthe destination could intercept\nmy traffic and read it.\n\n111\n00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.020\nThey could read what I'm sending on the\nnetwork or worse, they could modify it.\n\n112\n00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.320\nThey could modify the data and\nsend it along as if it were me and\n\n113\n00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.420\nnow bad things happen.\n\n114\n00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.010\nYou know I'm trying to do a money\ntransfer to my checking account and\n\n115\n00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.090\nnow it gets transferred to\nsomebody else checking account,\n\n116\n00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.160\ncuz they intercepted it and modified it.\n\n117\n00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.030\nThe Internet is not\na trusty worthy network.\n\n118\n00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.060\nIt's not evil or bad or anything,\nit's just you don't know who's out there.\n\n119\n00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.940\nIt's the wild west.\n\n120\n00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.370\nAnd so Anytime we use the internet\nas the network that we cross over,\n\n121\n00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.430\nwe need to secure our\ncommunications somehow.\n\n122\n00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.310\nWhen you're on your own network,\nwhen you're on a regular private network,\n\n123\n00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.030\nyou don't have to worry about\npeople intercepting traffic,\n\n124\n00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.190\nbecause you own all the equipment.\n\n125\n00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.470\nBut when you cross the internet\nyou don't own that.\n\n126\n00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.610\nAnd so we need to create\na virtual private network,\n\n127\n00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.800\na private network that just takes\ncare of our communications and\n\n128\n00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.810\nmakes them just as safe and\nsecure as if we were on our own network.\n\n129\n00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.730\nAnd so I've got a little diagram\nhere that shows how this works.\n\n130\n00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.590\nBasically the way a private network or\na VPN works Is that,\n\n131\n00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.940\nyou have a laptop that's connected to\nthe Internet, and you've got your work\n\n132\n00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.350\nthat's connected to the Internet, so\nthey should be able to see each other.\n\n133\n00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:29.710\nWell, you build a connection from you to\na firewall, or even to a server, right?\n\n134\n00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.110\nYou can actually connect.\n\n135\n00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.290\nLet me move this out of the way.\n\n136\n00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.950\nyou can actually connect\nall the way to a server.\n\n137\n00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.380\nAt your headquarters.\n\n138\n00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.020\nAnd when you connect like that,\n\n139\n00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.680\nwhat's gonna happen is you're able\nto create an encrypted tunnel.\n\n140\n00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.700\nAnd all of your regular data will\nget sent within that tunnel.\n\n141\n00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.610\nSo now, I might be checking my email,\nI might be sending a message,\n\n142\n00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.950\nI might be Loading my contacts list.\n\n143\n00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:02.550\nAnd even if I'm doing that unencrypted,\nit'll hit the tunnel, it'll get encrypted,\n\n144\n00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.140\nget sent across the Internet\nin a fully encrypted form and\n\n145\n00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.960\nthen dropped off at\nthe server on the other end,\n\n146\n00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.250\nwhere the server at the other end can\ndecrypt it and then read that information.\n\n147\n00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.110\nWe're creating an encrypted session.\n\n148\n00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.080\nNow there's protocols like SSL.\n\n149\n00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.970\nYou go to a webpage, right?\n\n150\n00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.100\nAnd you go to check out and\nbuy something and it switches you to SSL.\n\n151\n00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.950\nWell that's building an encrypted\ntunnel for just that one webpage.\n\n152\n00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.330\nWhat a VPN does is it builds\nup encrypted tunnels for\n\n153\n00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.130\nevery single communication between you And\nthat destination network.\n\n154\n00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.100\nSo now you get an encrypted session.\n\n155\n00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.630\nIf somebody intercepts the traffic in\nthe middle, they just see encrypted data.\n\n156\n00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.270\nIt means nothing to them.\n\n157\n00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:44.330\nAnd now, you're just as secure as if\nyour laptop was actually in your office.\n\n158\n00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.370\nNow you have that level of security.\n\n159\n00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.950\nIt's a really neat thing to have.\n\n160\n00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.590\nAnd it creates a safe environment on\na network that would otherwise be\n\n161\n00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:52.430\nuntrustworthy.\n\n162\n00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.961\n>> So Don, when you say, every protocol or\nevery communication successful, right?\n\n163\n00:07:56.961 --> 00:08:00.182\nI can't think of it, like or imagine an\nadministrator, somebody calls up and says,\n\n164\n00:08:00.182 --> 00:08:02.259\nhey our in-house DNS servers,\nsomething's wrong.\n\n165\n00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:03.187\nCan you connect in?\n\n166\n00:08:03.187 --> 00:08:07.199\nWell, DNS can be secure, but it's a lot\nof steps you have to go through, but\n\n167\n00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:09.220\nover the VPN, you'd be secure.\n\n168\n00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.840\n>> Yeah, take a protocol like FTP,\nwhere FTP can't be secured.\n\n169\n00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.950\nThere's alternative versions of FTP, but\n\n170\n00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.620\nthe main true version of\nFTP can't be secured.\n\n171\n00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.930\nSame thing with Telnet.\n\n172\n00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.260\nTelnet can't be secured.\n\n173\n00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.970\nSo, you've got a choice,\nyou can either go and\n\n174\n00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.080\nuse a different protocol,\ninstead of Telnet, I'm going to use SSH.\n\n175\n00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.810\nInstead of FTP, I'm gonna use STFP or\nsomething like that.\n\n176\n00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.710\nOr, if I need to use FTP, I can.\n\n177\n00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.320\nIf I need to use Telnet I can,\nif I flow them over a VPN tunnel.\n\n178\n00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.850\nI let the tunnel do the encryption,\n\n179\n00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.310\nand then I can use\nunencrypted protocols on it.\n\n180\n00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.770\nI can even double encrypt.\n\n181\n00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.380\nMaybe I know that SSL does encryption for\nwebpages, but\n\n182\n00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.620\nI put it over a VPN tunnel anyways,\nso now I'm encrypting with SSL and\n\n183\n00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.060\nencrypting with the tunnel\nthat's double the security.\n\n184\n00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.060\nRight?\nSo, it can be a very good thing and\n\n185\n00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.010\nit can make the internet\na very usable network.\n\n186\n00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:59.220\nSo, now somebody could go anywhere in\nthe world on any network, trustworthy or\n\n187\n00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:04.200\nnot, build up a VPN tunnel and\nthen work resting secure in the knowledge\n\n188\n00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.850\nthat their data is being encrypted and\nprotected on the network.\n\n189\n00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.040\nAll right so, if we want to see\nthis in action, how can we do it?\n\n190\n00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.590\nWell, let me show you what\nI'm gonna set up here.\n\n191\n00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.600\nSo I've got some servers\nkinda bouncing around.\n\n192\n00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.490\nLet me, I'm gonna give everybody motion\nsickness if I keep flipping around.\n\n193\n00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.390\nThe server that I've been\nusing all throughout the show,\n\n194\n00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.680\nthis guy right here, is on a network.\n\n195\n00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:31.170\nAnd that network is 192.168.0, so\nif I take a look at its IP address,\n\n196\n00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:36.282\nit is 192.168.0.151, so\nthis is my work network, 192.161.0.\n\n197\n00:09:36.282 --> 00:09:42.220\nI have a work station, this guy right\nhere, who is on a different network.\n\n198\n00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.770\nIf I take a look at it,\nit's on the 192.168.1 network.\n\n199\n00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:48.280\nThat's a different network.\n\n200\n00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:53.260\nSo in order for this workstation\nto get to that server, it's\n\n201\n00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.050\ngoing to have to cross the internet, or\nit's going to have to cross the routers,\n\n202\n00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.220\nor some kind of equipment to be able\nto jump from one network to the next.\n\n203\n00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.200\nThis client is not\nconnected to that server.\n\n204\n00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.020\nSo if this client were to try and\nping this server if we were\n\n205\n00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:11.460\nto try and ping 192 dot 168 dot\nzero dot 151, that's the server.\n\n206\n00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:15.735\nIf we try to ping that we get,\nrequest timed out, right?\n\n207\n00:10:15.735 --> 00:10:16.985\nI'm not connected to that network.\n\n208\n00:10:16.985 --> 00:10:18.695\nI can't get to it.\n\n209\n00:10:18.695 --> 00:10:22.875\nBut I can build a VPN\ntunnel from this system\n\n210\n00:10:22.875 --> 00:10:27.025\nto a VPN server on the 192.168.0 network.\n\n211\n00:10:27.025 --> 00:10:28.405\nAnd now I would be able to access it,\n\n212\n00:10:28.405 --> 00:10:31.235\nI'd be able to complete that\ncommunication, all right?\n\n213\n00:10:31.235 --> 00:10:35.630\nSo in order to do that,\nI just need to get a few things set up.\n\n214\n00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.340\nI'm going to take this\nserver way over here.\n\n215\n00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.500\nThis guy.\n\n216\n00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.030\nAnd this guy is a little bit special.\n\n217\n00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.690\nBecause it has two network adapters.\n\n218\n00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.080\nSo this server has two network adapters.\n\n219\n00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:53.080\nOne network adapter is on the 192.168.0\nnetwork on my internal, private network.\n\n220\n00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:53.730\nIt's my LAN.\n\n221\n00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.140\nAnd then the another network adapter is\n\n222\n00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:02.060\nout on the 192.168.1 network this would be\nthe one you put on the internet, right?\n\n223\n00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.510\nYou'd normally have a public IP here,\nI'm using a private one.\n\n224\n00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:09.390\nSo it's connected to the internet and\nit's connected to my local area network.\n\n225\n00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.350\nAnd this way somebody out there on the\ninternet can build a VPN tunnel to here\n\n226\n00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.630\nand then I'll provide them\naccess to the internal network.\n\n227\n00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.410\nThe server is on two networks at once,\nall right?\n\n228\n00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:23.510\nSo if we use my diagram way back here,\n\n229\n00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.910\nthis would be the equivalent of\nlike replacing this firewall, and\n\n230\n00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:32.370\nsaying the firewall is connected to two\ndifferent networks, so we'll have that max\n\n231\n00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:36.290\nserver sitting here connected to the two\ndifferent networks clients VPN into that\n\n232\n00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.720\nMac server and from there they're able\nto gain access to the internal network.\n\n233\n00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:45.260\nTo get that set up,\nI need to fire up my server app and\n\n234\n00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.330\nyou've got a VPN server right\ninside of the server app.\n\n235\n00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.050\nThis is the first time I've fired\nup the server app on this server so\n\n236\n00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.110\nit's gonna do a quick configuration.\n\n237\n00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:56.120\nWhile it's doing that I need\nto set up one more thing.\n\n238\n00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.890\nSo if I look at my diagram, I've got all\nthese different servers in here, and\n\n239\n00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:03.740\nif somebody comes in on\na VPN through that server,\n\n240\n00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.670\nI need to be able to reply back to them, I\nneed to be able to go back to that device.\n\n241\n00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:11.540\nSo I need to change that server's\ndefault gateway to be my VPN server, so\n\n242\n00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.170\nI'm gonna change that real quick while\nI'm waiting on the other one anyway.\n\n243\n00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.720\nSo, if I go into my system preferences,\nand\n\n244\n00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.910\ngo into my network adaptor,\nI can change that.\n\n245\n00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:26.664\nNow, that VPN Server,\nif I go back into my network utility,\n\n246\n00:12:26.664 --> 00:12:30.218\nits 192.168.0 address is 154.\n\n247\n00:12:30.218 --> 00:12:33.490\nSo, I am just going to update\nthat here on this system.\n\n248\n00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.550\nSo that it will have that\nproper default gateway action.\n\n249\n00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.930\nI'm using DHCP on this server anyway,\nI don't want that.\n\n250\n00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.860\nSo I'll switch all of that at once.\n\n251\n00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.729\nSo I'm gonna make it 192.168.0.151.\n\n252\n00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:46.320\nWe'll set it's default\ngateway to 192.168.0.154.\n\n253\n00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.890\nThat's my VPN server.\n\n254\n00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.800\nI need to go back out to the VPN server so\n\n255\n00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.580\nI'll be able to get to those clients\nthat are out there on the network.\n\n256\n00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.830\nSo I'll just set that and apply it.\n\n257\n00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:59.880\nSo now that's set properly.\n\n258\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.160\nOkay.\nSo now, on my VPN server,\n\n259\n00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.540\nit's still setting up it's server so,\nwe'll give it just a second.\n\n260\n00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.120\nSo, let me recap what I did just to make\nsure that we're on the same page and\n\n261\n00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.500\neverybody knows what I'm talking about\nis that, if we have a server sitting on\n\n262\n00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.990\nthe network, we've got two different paths\nof communication that are occurring.\n\n263\n00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.960\nSo, one path, is the client coming in.\n\n264\n00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.980\nAnd then we've got the server\nthat has to reply back.\n\n265\n00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.700\nOkay.\nSo for example,\n\n266\n00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.380\nwhen the client communicates in,\n\n267\n00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.750\nwhat's happening is,\nlet me make my line look pretty.\n\n268\n00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:38.430\nOkay, there the clients' data comes in and\nhits the firewall server here,\n\n269\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:39.730\nthe VPN server.\n\n270\n00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.620\nSo, the data crosses the Internet and\ncomes here, and\n\n271\n00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:46.800\nthis VPN server is going to\nsend the data into the server.\n\n272\n00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.220\nThe VPN server knowns how\nto get to that server.\n\n273\n00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.300\nThat's fine.\n\n274\n00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.000\nAnd so,\nit's gonna forward that data along.\n\n275\n00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.810\nThis guy here is just gonna send all\nof its traffic to the VPN server, but\n\n276\n00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.320\nthis server, when it receives\na communication, it has to reply back, and\n\n277\n00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.750\nwhen it replies back,\nit's got to reply to the VPN server.\n\n278\n00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.180\nAnd so that's what I was just fixing.\n\n279\n00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.010\nI changed the default\ngateway on this server, so\n\n280\n00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.760\nthat it would go back to\nthe VPN server on its way out.\n\n281\n00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.100\nYou might not have to do that\nbecause in real life land,\n\n282\n00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.280\nthis server might be your router already.\n\n283\n00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.860\nBut often times we have\na separate router and\n\n284\n00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.370\nif you have a separate router that's\nmoving the data, so for example if I have\n\n285\n00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:26.270\na Cisco router or something else that's\nsitting on the network like this,\n\n286\n00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.680\nwell that router which I just made\nlook really, really terrible.\n\n287\n00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.500\nThere we go.\nThat router,\n\n288\n00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:35.030\nit might not know about\nthese different networks.\n\n289\n00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:38.910\nAnd so you'd have to go into your router\nand add a route statement that said,\n\n290\n00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.750\nthis network is on the VPN,\nthis other network is internal,\n\n291\n00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.980\nthey kind of define it so the router\nwould know where to send people, and\n\n292\n00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.720\nthat would be your default gateway.\n\n293\n00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.020\nBut in my case, I'm going to use my\nVPN server as the default gateway.\n\n294\n00:14:50.352 --> 00:14:53.810\nAll right, so going back here,\nthere we go, now we're ready.\n\n295\n00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.440\nInside of our server app,\nyou'll actually see\n\n296\n00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.340\nthe two different networks that you've\ngot and so I've got my internal network,\n\n297\n00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.250\nthat's my private network, and I've got my\nexternal, my public, or my WAN network.\n\n298\n00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.740\nThat's where the clients\nare going to be coming in at.\n\n299\n00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.390\nAnd on the left side you'll see where\nyou've got your VPN server, and so\n\n300\n00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.110\nI can choose VPN.\n\n301\n00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.120\nIt's not even under advanced,\njust one of the regular services.\n\n302\n00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.040\nAnd we've got a handful of configuration\noptions that we're gonna need\n\n303\n00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.350\nto specify here.\n\n304\n00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:21.920\nNow, if you look at it,\nthe first decision is permissions.\n\n305\n00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.240\nWho's allowed to use it?\n\n306\n00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.170\nWe've seen that on every server so either\nwe can dictate IP's or user accounts, or\n\n307\n00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:29.410\nwhoever that are allowed to use the VPN.\n\n308\n00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.370\nThen we get to the real important stuff.\n\n309\n00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.528\nWhat kind of VPN do we want?\n\n310\n00:15:32.528 --> 00:15:37.440\nThere's two choices, L2TP and PPTP.\n\n311\n00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.820\nL2TP is the Layer 2 tunnelling protocol.\n\n312\n00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.610\nIt uses IPsec for encryption and\n\n313\n00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:45.230\nthat's very strong,\nthat's a good VPN protocol to use.\n\n314\n00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.460\nThat's the one Apple defaults to.\n\n315\n00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.830\nThe problem is not\neverybody supports L2TP.\n\n316\n00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:54.284\nAnd so if you want a protocol that's a\nlittle more well supported you can go with\n\n317\n00:15:54.284 --> 00:15:57.001\nPPTP, the point to point\ntunneling protocol.\n\n318\n00:15:57.001 --> 00:16:01.160\nThe problem with point to point tunneling\nprotocol is it uses encryption called\n\n319\n00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.219\nMPPE, and MPPE defaults to 40 bits.\n\n320\n00:16:03.219 --> 00:16:04.841\nAnd that's not very strong.\n\n321\n00:16:04.841 --> 00:16:10.010\nSo PPTP uses weak encryption,\nbut everybody supports it.\n\n322\n00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:14.080\nL2TP uses strong Encryption,\nbut not everybody supports it.\n\n323\n00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.740\nIf you're just dealing with Windows and\nMacs, L2TP is great.\n\n324\n00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.300\nThat's the one you want.\n\n325\n00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:24.340\nBut if you start bringing in VOIP phones,\nor Linux boxes,\n\n326\n00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.730\na lot of times you'll be limited to PPTP\nand so you might have to support that.\n\n327\n00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.710\nBut ideally, you'll just wanna do L2TP.\n\n328\n00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:31.350\nRight?\nBut\n\n329\n00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:32.880\nyou can certainly support\nboth if you want.\n\n330\n00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:39.520\nAfter that, you specify what your VPN Host\nName is or what's the name of your server.\n\n331\n00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.130\nYou'll have some kind of DNS name\nattached to the server and so\n\n332\n00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.700\nyou'll punch that here,\nwhatever that public DNS server is.\n\n333\n00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.190\nThen, a shared secret.\n\n334\n00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.950\nShared secret is a password.\n\n335\n00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:52.490\nFor somebody to build the VPN connection\nup, they're gonna have to have a password.\n\n336\n00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.970\nAnd it automatically generates one for\nyou, which you can certainly use.\n\n337\n00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.120\nI'm not gonna be able to remember\nthat That so for the show,\n\n338\n00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.430\nI'm just gonna type sharedsecret so\nthat I can remember that.\n\n339\n00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.230\nBut you can put in whatever\nyou want in there.\n\n340\n00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:08.340\nThe auto-generated one is kinda nice\ncuz it's random and fairly secure.\n\n341\n00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.830\nThen, client addresses.\n\n342\n00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:16.430\nBasically how many addresses is it\ngoing to set aside for VPN connections.\n\n343\n00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.880\nYou'll see my setting aside 16 for\nL2TP and 15 for PPTP.\n\n344\n00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.440\nYou can edit that and adjust those\nnumbers to make more or less space.\n\n345\n00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.810\nBasically it's going to grab some\nIP addresses and set them aside.\n\n346\n00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.470\nIf you've got DHCP it can\ngrab them right from that,\n\n347\n00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.610\notherwise it's just gonna set up a range.\n\n348\n00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.410\nHere it's starting with 192.168.0.224 and\ngoing on.\n\n349\n00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:37.750\nNow, from my network,\nthat might actually be a problem,\n\n350\n00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:41.190\nbecause I might have servers\nwho have IPs up in that range.\n\n351\n00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:45.090\nSo I might need to adjust this to pick a\nrange of IPs that aren't currently in use.\n\n352\n00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.700\nBut, you can certainly tweak that and\nset it however you want.\n\n353\n00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.330\nYou can reduce the numbers and so on.\n\n354\n00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.300\n>> Don, when you were hovering over that\nslider bar there it looked like there were\n\n355\n00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:52.860\ntwo ranges.\n\n356\n00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.860\nIs that two different scopes,\none for each protocol there?\n\n357\n00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:00.690\n>> Yeah, basically it's just saying the\n>> L2TP you'll get sixteen IPs, and\n\n358\n00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:01.940\nthose are gonna be 224 through 239.\n\n359\n00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:05.630\nAnd then fifteen from the other one,\nthat's 240 through 254.\n\n360\n00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:09.200\nIt just makes it a little easier to\nidentify based on the clients what\n\n361\n00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.090\nprotocol they connect it on.\n\n362\n00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.310\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n363\n00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.950\nIn fact, I know I don't have that\nmany clients so I could sit here and\n\n364\n00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:18.000\nreduce this number and\nmaybe I'll cut it down to ten.\n\n365\n00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.940\nNow I'll have five IPs available for each.\n\n366\n00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.790\nNow they're kind of slated in there.\n\n367\n00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:27.530\nAnd I can adjust this to say start it 230.\n\n368\n00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:31.370\nAnd so\nnow 230 through 234 will be L2TP and\n\n369\n00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:35.720\n235 through to 40 I guess would be PPTP.\n\n370\n00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:40.090\nSo, you have that little pop up tool tip,\nthere it goes.\n\n371\n00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:42.340\nThere's only 239, all right,\nwell we'll say Ok to that.\n\n372\n00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.830\nAnd so now I've got some IP's set.\n\n373\n00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.030\nI didn't have to adjust that, but\n\n374\n00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.740\nif I had more than 31 clients I'd\nneed to bump that up significantly.\n\n375\n00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.480\nThen, we've got our DNS Settings, right?\n\n376\n00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.380\nWhen somebody connects,\nwhat DNS server do I want them to use?\n\n377\n00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:59.520\nWhat domain for search suffix is the one\nthat I use and you can edit this and\n\n378\n00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.230\nset those values to however you want.\n\n379\n00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.960\nThey're gonna default to the local server\nand that might be what you want so\n\n380\n00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.680\nI'll just leave it be.\n\n381\n00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:11.530\nThen any custom routes if there's extra\nroutes that I want to provide as far as\n\n382\n00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:13.770\nconnectivity to other networks\nI can put it in there.\n\n383\n00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:17.150\nI'm gonna get routes for\nthe networks that I have interfaces on.\n\n384\n00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.240\nBut my company might have many,\nmany networks behind the scenes, and\n\n385\n00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.340\nI can add each one here into this list\nto make sure that they're able to route.\n\n386\n00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.170\nAnd then the configuration profile.\n\n387\n00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:30.670\nConfiguring a VPN is not an easy thing,\nand on the client side there's a lot\n\n388\n00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.870\nof settings that have to get put in, and\nyour clients are not going to remember it.\n\n389\n00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:39.590\nSo to make life easy, you can save\na profile and when you save that profile,\n\n390\n00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:44.610\nit's gonna save a mobile.config\nfile that has the VPN configuration\n\n391\n00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.910\nalready present so that clients can\njust double-click it and they get it.\n\n392\n00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:51.650\n>> Don, that configuration profile,\nis that something that you could put in\n\n393\n00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:55.460\nthe Profile Manager and push that out and\nhave that configured, so you wouldn't have\n\n394\n00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.760\nto go sneaker netting from every\ncomputer or device device device?\n\n395\n00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.180\n>> Yeah,\nthat's certainly the easiest way to do it,\n\n396\n00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.080\nyou go into profile manager and\nyou set it up.\n\n397\n00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.660\nBut the nice thing about is this is I\ndon't have to have a profile manager.\n\n398\n00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:08.370\nIn fact, the client's don't even have to\nbe bound to my directory or managed by\n\n399\n00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.420\na profile manager, so I'm gonna have\nguests that I wanna be able to VPN in.\n\n400\n00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.240\nI could put this on a USB key and\ngive it to them.\n\n401\n00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.310\nNow there is a little risk, in that if\nsomebody gets ahold of that USB key,\n\n402\n00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.090\nwhat can they do?\n\n403\n00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.400\nThey can VPN in, sort of.\n\n404\n00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.400\nWe still have to have a valid username and\na password, right?\n\n405\n00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.670\nYou still have to be able to\nauthenticate to get into the system, so\n\n406\n00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.210\nthere's still protection there.\n\n407\n00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.620\nBut this shared secret is gonna let\nthem build up an encrypted tunnel.\n\n408\n00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.800\nThey won't be able to decrypt\nsomebody else's data but\n\n409\n00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.470\nthey'll be able to encrypt their own.\n\n410\n00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:35.290\nAnd get connected.\n\n411\n00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:38.260\nAll right, now the tricky part.\n\n412\n00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.500\nWell, I guess the easy\npart of turning it on.\n\n413\n00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.990\nI need to do that so\nI'm going to turn it on.\n\n414\n00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:43.220\nNow the tricky part.\n\n415\n00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.460\nThe tricky part is I need to get this\nconfiguration profile over to a client.\n\n416\n00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.380\nAnd like I said, you could copy it to\na USB or something of that nature.\n\n417\n00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.070\nFor me, since these are actually\non the same network right now,\n\n418\n00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.480\nI'm gonna share this out.\n\n419\n00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.010\nAnd so if I go into file sharing.\n\n420\n00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.750\nIt's warning me about\nchanging my shared secret.\n\n421\n00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.310\nI'm gonna go ahead and let it change.\n\n422\n00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:07.490\nWhich means, because I just changed that.\n\n423\n00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:09.420\nYou have to be careful with changes.\n\n424\n00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.730\nBecause there's two things.\n\n425\n00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.320\nNotice down here it says VPN must be\nrestarted for the changes to take effect.\n\n426\n00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.680\nSo I had to restart for\nthat change to actually kick in,\n\n427\n00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.200\notherwise it wouldn't have happened.\n\n428\n00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.600\nAnd then the second thing is,\nwhen I exported that profile,\n\n429\n00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.760\nwhich secret did it have,\nthe old one or the new one?\n\n430\n00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.090\nI don't honestly know.\n\n431\n00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:27.730\nSo I need to export that profile again.\n\n432\n00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.150\nAgain, so that I've got it.\n\n433\n00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:33.250\nSo I'm gonna call this one VPN-new\n[LAUGH] so I can remember and so\n\n434\n00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.110\nthat it'll have the updated information,\nokay.\n\n435\n00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:38.470\nNow I need to get that profile\ncopied over to my client.\n\n436\n00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.730\nSo I'm gonna go over here to file\nsharing And I'll turn that on.\n\n437\n00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.790\nAnd my Public folder\nis already shared now.\n\n438\n00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:48.860\nSo I'm just going to move that\nprofile over into my public folder.\n\n439\n00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:53.270\nSo I'll take that new one,\nthen I'll go into my documents.\n\n440\n00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:57.070\nOr no, not my documents, I need to go\ninto my actual profile folder, my Home.\n\n441\n00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.680\nAnd then I can go into Public.\n\n442\n00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.800\nAnd I can drop it right there.\n\n443\n00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.280\nAll right.\nNow I'm going to jump over to my client.\n\n444\n00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.082\nNow, realize in real life that your\nclient is probably somebody remote.\n\n445\n00:22:07.082 --> 00:22:09.700\nThey're probably out there in a hotel or\nwhatever, so\n\n446\n00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.545\nyou're not going to be able to do a shared\nfolder to hand it off to him, right?\n\n447\n00:22:12.545 --> 00:22:16.185\nYou're more than likely going to\nhave to put it on a USB key or\n\n448\n00:22:16.185 --> 00:22:18.315\nsend it to him via email or something.\n\n449\n00:22:18.315 --> 00:22:20.141\nI think I forgot to turn that on didn't I?\n\n450\n00:22:20.141 --> 00:22:21.455\nNope, it's on, good.\n\n451\n00:22:21.455 --> 00:22:24.365\nAll right so on my client I'm going to\nbrowse the network and get that file.\n\n452\n00:22:26.085 --> 00:22:27.945\nI say I'm going to do it but.\n\n453\n00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:32.920\nHere we go, so\nlet me get connected to that server, and\n\n454\n00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.080\nI'll copy that profile over.\n\n455\n00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.070\nAnd then installing is super easy right?\n\n456\n00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:40.430\nNot a big deal there,\nto get that in place.\n\n457\n00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:48.120\nAnd there we go, all right so\nlet me just get that installed.\n\n458\n00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.590\nSo can't be opened, let me copy it local.\n\n459\n00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.040\nSometimes with profiles you get that,\n\n460\n00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.590\nwhere you're trying to open\nit from the network share and\n\n461\n00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:58.540\nit won't let you do it but\nif you copy it local it should do it fine.\n\n462\n00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.230\nThere we go.\n\n463\n00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:01.350\nJust copy it, and it's gonna go.\n\n464\n00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.290\nAll it's containing are the VPN settings.\n\n465\n00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:05.750\nNotice that it's asked me for a username.\n\n466\n00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.960\nThe VPN settings never actually asked for\na username but\n\n467\n00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.930\nI've gotta provide one in order to log in.\n\n468\n00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.880\nSo, I am gonna provide my account details.\n\n469\n00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.850\nMy account's donpezet.\n\n470\n00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:16.030\nAnd so it will install it.\n\n471\n00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:18.890\nYou have to be an administrator on\nthe local machine to add it, so\n\n472\n00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.560\nI just have to provide credentials\nthere and now VPN settings are in.\n\n473\n00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.520\nThat's gonna save me a lot of time and\nsave me from a lot of mistakes.\n\n474\n00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.350\nBecause if I go back here, and\n\n475\n00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:32.960\nI go into my network, I'll see that I\nnow have a VPN defined in my network.\n\n476\n00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.620\nAnd when you define a VPN,\nyou gotta provide your server address,\n\n477\n00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:37.430\nyour user account.\n\n478\n00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:39.140\nYou gotta provide the type of VPN.\n\n479\n00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.340\nYou gotta provide a lot of information.\n\n480\n00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:46.180\nThat is easy to make a mistake on,\nespecially that shared secret, right?\n\n481\n00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.984\nBecause a shared secret\ncould be really long and\n\n482\n00:23:47.984 --> 00:23:49.884\ncomplex you don't want\nyour user to type that in.\n\n483\n00:23:49.884 --> 00:23:52.958\nThe only thing it doesn't have\nat this point is my password so\n\n484\n00:23:52.958 --> 00:23:55.025\nI'm gonna punch that in so it's saved.\n\n485\n00:23:55.025 --> 00:23:56.715\nAnd I'll say OK to that.\n\n486\n00:23:56.715 --> 00:23:59.427\nAll right and now I'm good to go.\n\n487\n00:23:59.427 --> 00:24:02.836\nNow the thing about VPNs,\nonce you've got them created,\n\n488\n00:24:02.836 --> 00:24:05.490\nconnecting to them can\nbe a little annoying.\n\n489\n00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:07.860\nBecause what your end user\nwould effectively have to do,\n\n490\n00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:13.740\nis anytime they wanted to connect to the\nVPN, right, so they're out at some hotel,\n\n491\n00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.800\nthey want to connect they'd have\nto go to System Preferences.\n\n492\n00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.100\nThey'd have to go to Network.\n\n493\n00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.420\nThey'd have to click on the VPN.\n\n494\n00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.130\nThey'd have to click Connect.\n\n495\n00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.790\nThat's annoying.\n\n496\n00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:24.070\nAnd then once they're connected,\n\n497\n00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.500\nif it ever disconnects,\nthey might necessarily notice that.\n\n498\n00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.530\nAnd now they're sending data\nunencrypted on the network.\n\n499\n00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:34.010\nSo there's this little option down\nhere I really like Show VPN status in\n\n500\n00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:37.910\nMenu Bar and\nby turning that on it does two things.\n\n501\n00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:42.280\nOne, it gives you a little status icon\nup here that you can always see, so\n\n502\n00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.150\nyou will know if your connected or not.\n\n503\n00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.310\nAnd two, it makes it really easy to\nconnect because I can get out of this\n\n504\n00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:52.100\nscreen and I can just click on that icon,\nand you can connect right from there.\n\n505\n00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.420\nAnd so, I can just quick and easy whenever\nI want to connect jump up there and\n\n506\n00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:59.690\nI hit Connect and now it's reaching out\nand trying to VPN into that server.\n\n507\n00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.000\nAnd once it connects, I'll see that.\n\n508\n00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.770\nI'll have a visual queue right there.\n\n509\n00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:05.330\nIt let's me know it connected.\n\n510\n00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:06.840\nA big fat connection failed.\n\n511\n00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:11.060\nSo I'll see that I connected and\nif it ever drops, I'll see it.\n\n512\n00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.930\nI've got a visual queue on the screen.\n\n513\n00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.200\nNow I got authentication failed.\n\n514\n00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.330\nThere was the pre-shared key, which I\nknow is right, because it carried over.\n\n515\n00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:20.600\nAnd there was my own username and\npassword and\n\n516\n00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.870\nI'm betting I got my own\nusername wrong on the server.\n\n517\n00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:27.010\nSo let me just jump back to server and\nverify what my username is.\n\n518\n00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:27.620\nShut.\n\n519\n00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.000\nMy username is dpuset,\nI put in donpuset, so\n\n520\n00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.450\nlet my go fix that on my VPN connection.\n\n521\n00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.930\nSo I just need to go into\nmy system preferences.\n\n522\n00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.460\nGo into network find the VPN.\n\n523\n00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.720\nAnd fix my stinking user name.\n\n524\n00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.870\nThere we go all right.\n\n525\n00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:47.030\nSo now that that's fixed I should be good\nto go now sometimes I would clear out your\n\n526\n00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.570\npassword so I'm just going to double\ncheck and make sure my password stayed.\n\n527\n00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:56.060\nIt didn't and so now I should be able to\nretry that and we'll connect our vpn.\n\n528\n00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.600\nNow, at the beginning of the show\nI tried to ping from this client\n\n529\n00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.670\nto a server on the other network.\n\n530\n00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:03.590\nI'm on the 192.168.1 network.\n\n531\n00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:07.070\nI tried to connect to the 192.168.0\nnetwork and it failed.\n\n532\n00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:10.560\nSo I can see right here where\nI did that ping and it failed.\n\n533\n00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.370\nBut once I VPN'd in and\nI'm connected, right?\n\n534\n00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:17.760\nSo it shows right here, I'm connected\nto the VPN, I've been connected for\n\n535\n00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.170\n18 seconds now I should be\nable to talk to that network,\n\n536\n00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.110\nassuming everything is set right.\n\n537\n00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:27.380\nAnd when I connect,\nI should be able to move all my data and\n\n538\n00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.330\nknow it's encrypted and\nknow that it's safe.\n\n539\n00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:31.830\nNow notice how my icon didn't change.\n\n540\n00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:32.410\nIt used to.\n\n541\n00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:36.140\nIn older versions of OS X,\nit would actually turn green.\n\n542\n00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.890\nAnd Apple did this thing where they want\nall the menu bar icons to be gray now.\n\n543\n00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.710\nAnd so, I don't get a great\nvisual confirmation by default\n\n544\n00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.140\nwhether I'm connected or not.\n\n545\n00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.290\nBut, you can do this\nshowtime connected option.\n\n546\n00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:50.010\nAnd now it'll display a time and\n\n547\n00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.820\nthat way if I ever get\ndisconnected the time disappears.\n\n548\n00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.830\nAnd so now I've got that visual cue and\n\n549\n00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:59.550\nit's in the grey visual format that\nApple likes for whatever reason.\n\n550\n00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.580\nI've been connected for a solid minute,\nlet's see if this thing is even working.\n\n551\n00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:09.000\nIf I also click and look at it here,\nyou get Show Status While Connecting,\n\n552\n00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.240\nbut I don't see the actual status,\nI don't know, am I actually using it?\n\n553\n00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.900\nI'm going to try and ping, and\nthis time I'm pinging that server and\n\n554\n00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.860\nI can actually get to it.\n\n555\n00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:24.130\nI'm able to see the 192.168.0 network even\nthough I couldn't see it before cause I\n\n556\n00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:27.720\nwas remote and I'm going over\nthat VPN tunnel to get there.\n\n557\n00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.730\nAll my data is being encrypted, sent\nacross the tunnel to the other side, and\n\n558\n00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:34.440\nnow I can talk to this network\nthat I did have access to before.\n\n559\n00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.065\n>> Don, let's say.\n\n560\n00:27:35.065 --> 00:27:37.755\nIf you were pinging right now and\nlike you've shown us,\n\n561\n00:27:37.755 --> 00:27:39.735\nyou've got both sides set up right.\n\n562\n00:27:39.735 --> 00:27:43.105\nAnd all of a sudden, you go to ping,\nand you can't ping, and\n\n563\n00:27:43.105 --> 00:27:44.505\nyou've got a firewall in between.\n\n564\n00:27:44.505 --> 00:27:46.855\nIs there any consideration,\nsomething you can troubleshoot,\n\n565\n00:27:46.855 --> 00:27:48.430\nas to why it might block that?\n\n566\n00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:53.270\nWell Wes, the firewall wouldn’t\nlike interrupt your connection,\n\n567\n00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:55.500\nit would stop you from\nconnecting in the first place.\n\n568\n00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:59.480\nIn order to get connected,\nyou’ve got to pass through a firewall to\n\n569\n00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:04.350\nget to the VPN server, and it’s expecting\ncertain ports and connections to be open,\n\n570\n00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.210\nand if they aren’t, it’s gonna break.\n\n571\n00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:10.140\nNow the ports are different\nbased on whether it’s PPTP or\n\n572\n00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:15.200\nL2TP PPTP, the point to point tunneling\nprotocol, it's the most basic of the two,\n\n573\n00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.040\nand so it's really just using\ntwo things to get connected.\n\n574\n00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.740\nIt's got TCP port 1723,\n\n575\n00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:24.390\nthat's the main port that is establishing\nit's connection on and is running with.\n\n576\n00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:27.400\nBut it also uses another\nprotocol called GRE.\n\n577\n00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.880\nGRE is the generic routing and\nencapsulation protocol.\n\n578\n00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.680\nAnd what it does is it allows you to\nmove traffic across the tunnel, but\n\n579\n00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.980\nthe traffic's not encrypted.\n\n580\n00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.100\nAnd then it uses NPPE\nto do the encryption.\n\n581\n00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:42.450\nSo on your firewall it has\nto allow TCP port 723 and\n\n582\n00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:45.120\nGRE, which is sometimes\ncalled protocol 47.\n\n583\n00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.350\nA lot of protocols have a number assigned\nto them, this one's protocol 47.\n\n584\n00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:53.160\nSo, if those two things are open on the\nfirewall to allow us to get to the server\n\n585\n00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.960\nthat's acting as our VPN server\nwe'll get to it and it's just fine.\n\n586\n00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.720\nIf those aren't opened,\nwe won't connect them in the first place.\n\n587\n00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.070\nSo, it's not so much a matter of\nour connection being interrupted.\n\n588\n00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:04.840\nIt's just we never, actually,\nget there to begin with.\n\n589\n00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.330\nAnd, it's easy to spot that type of thing\non your server because you can look in\n\n590\n00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:11.420\nthe logs and you won't see people even get\nto the server better yet get there and\n\n591\n00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.040\nfail, right?\n\n592\n00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.990\nSo, if they don't even get there,\nit's probably a firewall problem.\n\n593\n00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:16.280\nBut that's just PPTP.\n\n594\n00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.340\nIt's the easier of the two.\n\n595\n00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.110\nL2TP is a little more involved.\n\n596\n00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:22.290\nThere's actually four things\nthat need to be open for L2TP.\n\n597\n00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:26.710\nWe had a couple of ports,\nthere's UDP port 500,\n\n598\n00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:31.970\nthere's UDP port 1701, and\nthen there's UDP port 4500.\n\n599\n00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:33.520\nThree different ports.\n\n600\n00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.970\nAnd that's because L2TP is using IPsec.\n\n601\n00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:38.930\nAnd IPsec is not a protocol.\n\n602\n00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:39.780\nIt's a framework.\n\n603\n00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.910\nIt's a collection of protocols.\n\n604\n00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:45.270\nAnd so each of these ports are responsible\nfor different functions inside of\n\n605\n00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:48.630\nthe communication as far as\nsetting up your hashing algorithm,\n\n606\n00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:53.360\ndoing your verified signatures,\ndoing your actual tunnel and encryption.\n\n607\n00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.530\nEach one needs different connectivity.\n\n608\n00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:56.370\nSo, it's three different ports.\n\n609\n00:29:56.370 --> 00:30:00.130\nAnd then, when it actually starts\nmoving the encrypted data,\n\n610\n00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:05.380\nit's using a protocol called ESP,\nthe Encapsulated Security Payload.\n\n611\n00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.240\nAnd what ESP does Is it actually\nencrypts and tunnels your data, and\n\n612\n00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.340\nit has a protocol number\njust like GRE does.\n\n613\n00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:16.400\nESP is protocol number 50, and so\non your firewall it might show as ESP or\n\n614\n00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.100\nit might show as protocol 50,\nbut that'll have to be enabled.\n\n615\n00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:24.800\nIf you're just using L2TP You don't\nneed to open up the PPTP Ports.\n\n616\n00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.330\nIf you're just using PPTP,\nyou don't have to open up the L2TP.\n\n617\n00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:30.950\nBut if you're using both, you're\ngoing to need to open them all up and\n\n618\n00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:35.190\nlet them through to be able to get to\nthe Mac that's acting as your VPN server.\n\n619\n00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:36.840\nIf you can, you'll be able to connect.\n\n620\n00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.660\nIf you can't,\nyou won't even make it to the server, and\n\n621\n00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.550\nthat's just going to kill it right there.\n\n622\n00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:44.130\nDon't expect to see\nintermittent disconnects.\n\n623\n00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:47.480\nIf you get intermittent disconnects,\nit's not gonna be because of a firewall.\n\n624\n00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:50.170\nIt's going to be because of\nthings like network congestion,\n\n625\n00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.840\npoor wireless networks, low bandwidth.\n\n626\n00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.250\nThat's what's going to cause you to\nintermittently disconnect and that's\n\n627\n00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:59.870\nnot the fault of the VPN or your firewall,\nit's the fault of your network connection.\n\n628\n00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:03.880\nBut once you're connected you can kind\nof rule the firewall out as a problem.\n\n629\n00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.220\nYou've already passed\nthrough the firewall,\n\n630\n00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:08.060\nyou got connected, everything else\nis gonna be tied to the network.\n\n631\n00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:11.110\n>> Don, with the Generic Routing\nEncapsulation protocol is there any kind\n\n632\n00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:14.500\nof identifier or anything that I\ncan ensure that it is turned on?\n\n633\n00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.339\nCuz you said the protocol itself, is\nthere any identifier associated with it?\n\n634\n00:31:18.632 --> 00:31:23.340\nNot really, you have these [INAUDIBLE]\nthat define these protocol numbers, and\n\n635\n00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.120\nGRE is actually protocol number 47.\n\n636\n00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.140\nSo on some firewalls they'll\ncall it protocol 47.\n\n637\n00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.810\nBut normally they just call it GRE.\n\n638\n00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:35.000\nAnd so TCP 1723 and GRE or protocol 47,\n\n639\n00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.060\nthose need to be open, that's going\nto make sure we have functionality.\n\n640\n00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:44.600\nThere's a few others that you might bump\ninto with L2TP, which is, let's see,\n\n641\n00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:50.885\nI've got them jotted down here, UDP port\n500, UDP port 1701 and UDP port 4500.\n\n642\n00:31:50.885 --> 00:31:56.559\nBut if I enable all of those on a PPTP and\nL2TP functionality If I just want L2TP,\n\n643\n00:31:56.559 --> 00:32:00.911\nyou can actually get away with\njust the last three that i said.\n\n644\n00:32:00.911 --> 00:32:05.278\nThe UDP500, UDP1701 and UDP4500.\n\n645\n00:32:05.278 --> 00:32:07.820\nYou guys probably notice I'm\nlooking at my notes on that.\n\n646\n00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:08.790\nI don't have these memorized.\n\n647\n00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:11.060\nThey don't expect you to have them\nmemorized on the exam, either.\n\n648\n00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.760\nBut, just know that these are the port\nnumbers that you've gotta have open\n\n649\n00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:14.590\non that firewall.\n\n650\n00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:16.590\n>> All right, I'm going to test\nmy memory on this one, Don, and\n\n651\n00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:18.410\nsee if I can remember.\n\n652\n00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.390\nBoy, those UDP ports,\nthat port 500 and that port 4500,\n\n653\n00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:23.730\nthose really sound like\nIPsec encryption ports.\n\n654\n00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:24.780\nIs that what we're looking at there?\n\n655\n00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:25.760\n>> That's exactly it.\n\n656\n00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.400\nIt L2TP is using IPsec.\n\n657\n00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.850\nThat's what it's using to encrypt and\nsecures data.\n\n658\n00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:31.870\nIPsec is not a protocol.\n\n659\n00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.410\nIt's actually a framework, so\nmultiple protocols to get in the mix, and\n\n660\n00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.190\nso you'll see all sorts of different\nthings that bump up there.\n\n661\n00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.760\nAnother one that can creep up,\nit's another protocol,\n\n662\n00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:46.590\nGRE is the Generic Routing Encapsulation\nand PPTP really likes to use that.\n\n663\n00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:52.950\nL2TP will typically use ESP,\nthe Encapsulating Security Payload.\n\n664\n00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:54.000\nThere we go, ESP.\n\n665\n00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.660\nAnd that one is protocol 50.\n\n666\n00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:59.260\nSo protocol 47 for GRE,\nprotocol 50 for ESP.\n\n667\n00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.360\nThose two get into the mix also.\n\n668\n00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.620\nThese are all different\nports that get into the mix.\n\n669\n00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:06.850\nAnd like I said, if they're not open,\nyou just won't connect, right.\n\n670\n00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:09.310\nAnd so you just don't get in\nthere in the first place.\n\n671\n00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:13.370\nBut, once you get connected, usually the\nonly reason you get disconnected is if you\n\n672\n00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:16.740\nstayed connected too long,\ncuz there is a maximum time on a tunnel.\n\n673\n00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.970\nUsually something less than 24 hours.\n\n674\n00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:21.460\nAnd then the other thing is just\nif the network gets too congested,\n\n675\n00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.920\nyou start dropping too many packets,\nyou can get disconnected.\n\n676\n00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.260\nAnd when you get disconnected now you're\nnot gonna be able to talk to those remote\n\n677\n00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:27.870\nhosts anymore.\n\n678\n00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.310\nYou become isolated and unsecured.\n\n679\n00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:34.370\nSo, all different things to think about\nto make sure that we secure the system.\n\n680\n00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.910\nAnother thing you can do if you ever wanna\ntest, you can fire up a network sniffer\n\n681\n00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:41.040\nand see if your traffic's actually\ngetting encrypted on the network.\n\n682\n00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.860\nYou're average end user's not gonna\ndo that, but as an admin you can do\n\n683\n00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:47.340\nit to see and actually verify your\nVPNs doing what it's supposed to do.\n\n684\n00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:51.100\n>> A lot of great information on VPNs, and\nI love it when we talk security there.\n\n685\n00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.380\nNow, I know in the past I've talked to you\nbefore, supporting them sometimes can be\n\n686\n00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.440\na little bit difficult, but it does look\nlike we're coming to the end of another\n\n687\n00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:01.170\nepisode here Don, but before we do,\ndo you got any additional advice on VPNs?\n\n688\n00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:02.770\n>> If they don't work, right?\n\n689\n00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:05.240\nIf things aren't working your\nfirewall is a great place to check,\n\n690\n00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.040\none thing to look at.\n\n691\n00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.387\nAlso you have logs on your server,\nlike everything,\n\n692\n00:34:09.387 --> 00:34:10.756\nI can pull those up here real quick.\n\n693\n00:34:10.756 --> 00:34:14.906\nSo, if I go to the server app, and\nI go to logs and I go to my system log,\n\n694\n00:34:14.906 --> 00:34:19.588\nyou've got a VPN service log in there and\nit will show you people connecting.\n\n695\n00:34:19.588 --> 00:34:23.000\nIf somebody tries to connect and\nit fails, it will turn up in here.\n\n696\n00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.810\nYou can also see whether people\nare connecting with L2TP or PPTP and\n\n697\n00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:28.960\nevaluate how they're connecting.\n\n698\n00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.540\nEarlier I tried to connect and\nI had a bad password, right.\n\n699\n00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:36.710\nSo if I scroll back through the logs,\nhere I can see user dpezet authorized for\n\n700\n00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:39.120\naccess, that's when I was\nactually able to connect.\n\n701\n00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:42.445\nBut if I keep going back I should be\nable to find where I tried to connect as\n\n702\n00:34:42.445 --> 00:34:44.195\ndonpozet right here.\n\n703\n00:34:44.195 --> 00:34:47.085\nCHAP peer authentication failed for\ndonpozet.\n\n704\n00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:51.595\nSo, you can start to see and then find\nout this is why he was disconnected.\n\n705\n00:34:51.595 --> 00:34:56.557\nHe tried to connect with L2TP but got\ndisconnected because bad password, right.\n\n706\n00:34:56.557 --> 00:34:57.800\nAuthentication failure.\n\n707\n00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.470\nIn my case, it was bad user name,\nnot bad password, but you get the idea.\n\n708\n00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:04.370\nSo, remember that you've got these logs\nthat if you need to troubleshoot and\n\n709\n00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:07.160\nfind out why something went wrong,\nthis is a great place to look.\n\n710\n00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.940\n>> Well,\nDon we appreciate that information and\n\n711\n00:35:08.940 -->

00:00:16.394\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\n\n4\n00:00:16.394 --> 00:00:21.481\ntoday's episode we're continuing through\nour OS X Server Essential series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:24.381\nAnd what we're looking at today\nis providing network services,\n\n6\n00:00:24.381 --> 00:00:26.730\nmore specifically web services.\n\n7\n00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.000\nAnd we've got none other than Mr.\nDon Pezet in the house.\n\n8\n00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.180\nDon, how are you doing sir?\n\n9\n00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.850\n>> I'm doing great Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.530\nReady to dive right back into\nthe world of the server app in OS X.\n\n11\n00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.380\nAnd looking at a web server.\n\n12\n00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.850\nRight now a lot of organizations use\nweb servers for various purposes.\n\n13\n00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.640\nYou might have web applications,\nyou might have an internal website.\n\n14\n00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.290\nOr maybe you're just messing around and\nyou need a quick web server fired up.\n\n15\n00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.128\nWell, the server app has support for that.\n\n16\n00:00:48.128 --> 00:00:51.300\nI know I've mentioned in other episodes\nhow really the server app is a graphical\n\n17\n00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.920\nuser interface to a lot of\nopen source technologies.\n\n18\n00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.960\nSo these are things that Apple\ndidn't have to create from scratch,\n\n19\n00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.560\nthey just made the UI for it.\n\n20\n00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.860\nThe web server is no exception.\n\n21\n00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.140\nSo the web server available in\nthe server app is actually Apache,\n\n22\n00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.530\nApache is the most common\nweb server in the world.\n\n23\n00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.920\nSome people say that nginX\nis the most popular,\n\n24\n00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.410\nbut nginX is not technically a web server,\nit's a proxy.\n\n25\n00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.990\nSo Apache is the most popular\nweb server in the world,\n\n26\n00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.850\nand, it's built in to your Mac.\n\n27\n00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.040\nIt's actually built into your Mac even if\nyou don't have the server app installed.\n\n28\n00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.880\nBut when you install the server app,\nit gives you the ability to control it.\n\n29\n00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.440\nWithout it, it's the system that\ncontrols it and uses it for\n\n30\n00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.840\nvarious system processes.\n\n31\n00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.740\nBut with the server app installed, you can\nnow control it to host your own web pages\n\n32\n00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.230\nand build up a web server right\ninside of your own environment.\n\n33\n00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.810\nAnd you'll find that it's\nactually pretty powerful.\n\n34\n00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.050\nIt can do a lot of neat stuff.\n\n35\n00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.520\nSo, we're going to film two\nepisodes on the web server.\n\n36\n00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.870\nThis first one, I just wanna\nfocus on the basic web server.\n\n37\n00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.930\nHow it works, what it does, how we can\nthrow some web pages in there, and\n\n38\n00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.590\nget our own site created.\n\n39\n00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.050\nIn the next episode we're gonna\ngo a little more advanced, and\n\n40\n00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.650\nwe'll talk about web applications.\n\n41\n00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.450\nActually getting executable programs\nthat can run inside of a web page,\n\n42\n00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.470\nhosted from the web server.\n\n43\n00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.880\nIts neat stuff, definitely\nsomething we will want to cover.\n\n44\n00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.350\nBut let's just start off with the basics.\n\n45\n00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.770\nFor the basics I think most of you\nguys understand what a web server is.\n\n46\n00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.440\nSo its a server that's holding\na bunch of web pages, and\n\n47\n00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.460\nthe web pages are normally written\nin HTML, hyper text markup language.\n\n48\n00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.080\nSo you have a bunch of text\nfiles that are in HTML format.\n\n49\n00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.290\nAnd a web server is just sitting there\nwaiting for people to ask for the pages.\n\n50\n00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.786\nSo a client connects to the server and\nuses the Hypertext Transport Protocol, or\n\n51\n00:02:22.786 --> 00:02:24.450\nhttp, to talk to the server.\n\n52\n00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.000\nAnd say hey could you give\nme a copy of this web page.\n\n53\n00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.330\nAnd then all the server does is\nsends that HTML to the client.\n\n54\n00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.230\nIt's really like a file transfer protocol.\n\n55\n00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.010\nWe're just copying a file from the server\nto the client so the client can render it.\n\n56\n00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.750\nWhere that gets different\nis web applications,\n\n57\n00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.850\nthen it really starts to get crazy.\n\n58\n00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.400\nBut for\nwhat we're gonna see here in this episode,\n\n59\n00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.030\nit's really not that much different\nthan file transfer protocol.\n\n60\n00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.180\nThen our clients are able to\ntranslate that into a webpage and\n\n61\n00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.840\nwe see a pretty web page,\nthat's happening all the time.\n\n62\n00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.260\nAnytime you browse the web that\nstuff is going on in the background.\n\n63\n00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.190\nWell if we want our Mac to be a web\nserver, all we have to do is turn it on.\n\n64\n00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.293\nNow when you go into the OS X server app,\nso\n\n65\n00:02:58.293 --> 00:03:02.464\nI've got the server app fired up here on\nmy client, and we look down the left side.\n\n66\n00:03:02.464 --> 00:03:05.950\nWhat you're gonna find is\none entry called Websites.\n\n67\n00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.790\nNow there's actually two things that are\ntied to the web server, Websites and Wiki.\n\n68\n00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.720\nWe'll talk about the Wiki\nmore in another episode, but\n\n69\n00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.500\nall a Wiki is is a webpage that people\ncan edit directly from their web browser.\n\n70\n00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.410\nA website normally needs to be edited\nsomewhere else, through your Dreamweaver,\n\n71\n00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.700\nor some other application.\n\n72\n00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.040\nJust a text editor, but\nit's done outside of the web browser.\n\n73\n00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.120\nThese two are both using Apache,\nand actually so is Calendar.\n\n74\n00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.758\nCalendar uses CALDAV, Calendar\nDistributed Authoring and Versioning, so\n\n75\n00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:39.672\nCALDAV, I guess, C-A-L-D-A-V.\n\n76\n00:03:39.672 --> 00:03:42.060\nAnd CALDAV is built on top\nof the web server, too.\n\n77\n00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.040\nDon't quote me on this, but I believe\ncontacts is tied into the same thing, but\n\n78\n00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.250\nI could be wrong on that.\n\n79\n00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.440\nBut Websites and Wiki absolutely both tied\nto Apache, they both turn that service on.\n\n80\n00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.752\nNow let's focus on the website side.\n\n81\n00:03:54.752 --> 00:03:57.380\nI wanna build a web server,\nI wanna turn on Apache, and\n\n82\n00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.020\nI want it to host some web pages.\n\n83\n00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.860\nSo the websites, that's what I need,\nthat's going to turn on Apache.\n\n84\n00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.140\nAnd when you look at\nthe settings that are available,\n\n85\n00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.750\nthere's not a whole heck of a lot for\nus to customize.\n\n86\n00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.800\nThe first thing we've got here is\njust the status and permissions,\n\n87\n00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.510\nlike we've seen on pretty\nmuch every service.\n\n88\n00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.900\nYou can control who is\nallowed to get to it.\n\n89\n00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.350\nI might want to have\nan internal only website.\n\n90\n00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.770\nI don't want anybody in the outside world\ngetting to it, just internal for me.\n\n91\n00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.570\nI could come in and edit the permissions\nand changes, that was a network only, and\n\n92\n00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.330\nnow we would just have it.\n\n93\n00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.725\nBut if I leave it at the default as all\nnetworks, anybody who could get through my\n\n94\n00:04:31.725 --> 00:04:34.482\nfirewall and get to the server\nwould be able to see that webpage.\n\n95\n00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:38.067\nThen you've got some advanced options\nhere like enabling PHP and Python.\n\n96\n00:04:38.067 --> 00:04:42.027\nNow normally a web page is HTML,\nhypertext markup language and\n\n97\n00:04:42.027 --> 00:04:47.347\nit's just a text file that got copied from\nthe web server to the client and rendered.\n\n98\n00:04:47.347 --> 00:04:50.988\nPython and PHP are different,\nwith Python and PHP,\n\n99\n00:04:50.988 --> 00:04:53.817\nyou have scripts that are on the server.\n\n100\n00:04:53.817 --> 00:04:57.635\nAnd the server runs those scripts and\nthe scripts generate results.\n\n101\n00:04:57.635 --> 00:05:01.130\nAnd the and the results are HTML\nthat's sent to the clients.\n\n102\n00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.330\nSo the clients aren't\ngetting a static text file.\n\n103\n00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.500\nThey're getting a dynamic text file\nthat's generated by the server.\n\n104\n00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.230\nThe server has to do some work.\n\n105\n00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.320\nNow, there's pros and cons to that.\n\n106\n00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.050\nOn the pro side, you can create\ncustomized web pages for your users.\n\n107\n00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.480\nThink about when you go to Amazon.\n\n108\n00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.850\nIf you go to www.amazon.com\nyou see a homepage.\n\n109\n00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.150\nIf you've never been to Amazon ever\nbefore it's the first time you go,\n\n110\n00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.410\nyou'll see the same homepage that anyone\nelse there for the first time is.\n\n111\n00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.210\nBut what do you see the second\ntime you go to Amazon's page?\n\n112\n00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.460\nOr the third time?\n\n113\n00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.610\nYou see a little bar of items\nthat you looked at previously, or\n\n114\n00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.490\nstuff you left in your shopping cart.\n\n115\n00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.473\nOr hey you bought X-Files on\nDVD maybe you'd like to buy\n\n116\n00:05:41.473 --> 00:05:43.134\nMarried With Children on DVD.\n\n117\n00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:44.945\nThat kind of stuff,\nyou get recommendations.\n\n118\n00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:47.920\nThat webpage was custom generated for you.\n\n119\n00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.290\nAnd they do that by using\ntechnologies like PHP and Python.\n\n120\n00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:56.270\nThere's a script that ran on the server\nthat said, all right, Don just connected.\n\n121\n00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.930\nHe's got a cookie, so\nI know that it is him.\n\n122\n00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.304\nAnd last time,\nhe bought some X-Files DVDs.\n\n123\n00:06:01.304 --> 00:06:04.534\nSo, this time, let me recommend\nthese other features to him.\n\n124\n00:06:04.534 --> 00:06:09.025\nAnd then it builds a custom HTML file\njust for me and sends it to me so\n\n125\n00:06:09.025 --> 00:06:10.424\nI can see that page.\n\n126\n00:06:10.424 --> 00:06:12.497\nIt's a lot of work that's\ndone on the server end.\n\n127\n00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:15.166\n>> Now Don,\nI could say that that sounds like there's\n\n128\n00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.227\na complexity versus a basic text file.\n\n129\n00:06:17.227 --> 00:06:20.505\nAnd with any kind of complexity it\nseems like it could be prone to errors,\n\n130\n00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.215\nis that what we might be seeing here?\n\n131\n00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:25.040\n>> Yeah,\nthe errors can take a few different forms.\n\n132\n00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.007\nSo the biggest thing that we need to\nworry about is simply processor power.\n\n133\n00:06:28.007 --> 00:06:32.514\nIs when it's HTML, we just copy\na file to the client and that's it.\n\n134\n00:06:32.514 --> 00:06:34.486\nAll the work's really being\ndone by the web browser.\n\n135\n00:06:34.486 --> 00:06:37.717\nBut with PHP and In Python,\nyour server's doing the work.\n\n136\n00:06:37.717 --> 00:06:40.134\nSo, if you have a lot of\npeople hitting your site,\n\n137\n00:06:40.134 --> 00:06:42.274\nyou've got to watch the activity monitor.\n\n138\n00:06:42.274 --> 00:06:45.940\nMake sure you're not gonna run out\nof resources and bog things down.\n\n139\n00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.790\nThe other thing is,\nyour server is running a program.\n\n140\n00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.150\nA program that's available to users\nthat are out there on the Internet.\n\n141\n00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.620\nSo what's out there on the Internet?\n\n142\n00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.760\nHackers, people who are going\nto attack your website.\n\n143\n00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.500\nAnd if they can find\na vulnerability in your PHP or\n\n144\n00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.750\na vulnerability in your Python, they can\npossibly inject their own code into it and\n\n145\n00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.910\nhave it execute on your server.\n\n146\n00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.130\nSo you've always gotta make sure you\nfollow proper security practices when you\n\n147\n00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.660\ncreate these apps and put them in place.\n\n148\n00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.470\nIt's definitely a concern that we have,\none that's more and\n\n149\n00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.410\nmore visible today than ever.\n\n150\n00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.680\nNow your web server is gonna be\nconstantly patched by Apple to\n\n151\n00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.390\nmake sure that it stays up to date and\nstays protected.\n\n152\n00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.920\nBut when it comes to Python and\nPHP, you write those.\n\n153\n00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.240\nThat's your own application\nthat you create.\n\n154\n00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.390\nIt's up to you to keep that secure and\nsafe, and\n\n155\n00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.590\na lot of people just don't\ntake the proper precautions.\n\n156\n00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.520\nSo, those are some of the things\nthat we need to think about.\n\n157\n00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.560\nThe only other stuff that we have\nright here are the ports, and\n\n158\n00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.280\nyou'll notice that it defaults to two\ndifferent ports, port 80 and port 443.\n\n159\n00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.490\nWhenever you connect to a network service,\n\n160\n00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.990\nthere's a port number that\nidentifies what the service is.\n\n161\n00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:53.250\nAnd HTTP, the hypertext transport\nprotocol, uses port 80 by default, so\n\n162\n00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.430\nI see port 80.\n\n163\n00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.070\nSo what's 443?\n\n164\n00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.468\nWell, it's HTTP also, but\nusing SSL, Secure Socket Layer.\n\n165\n00:08:00.468 --> 00:08:03.624\nAnd I say SSL, but\nmost sites don't actually use SSL anymore.\n\n166\n00:08:03.624 --> 00:08:06.214\nNow they use TLS,\nTransport Layer Security.\n\n167\n00:08:06.214 --> 00:08:09.860\nBarthilas runs on 443 also,\nso it's the same thing.\n\n168\n00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:15.722\nSo basically, what you have is unencrypted\nweb traffic and encrypted web traffic.\n\n169\n00:08:15.722 --> 00:08:17.923\nNow if this is going to be\navailable to the Internet,\n\n170\n00:08:17.923 --> 00:08:20.923\nyou probably don't want to change\nthese because people on the Internet\n\n171\n00:08:20.923 --> 00:08:23.189\nexpect your services to be\navailable on these ports.\n\n172\n00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:25.208\nBut if it's an internal only service,\n\n173\n00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:27.726\nyou can change these ports\nto whatever you want.\n\n174\n00:08:27.726 --> 00:08:31.508\nSo for example my internal site,\nI might wanna add it that and\n\n175\n00:08:31.508 --> 00:08:36.106\nchange it to dictate only certain people\ncan get to it or I might want to edit\n\n176\n00:08:36.106 --> 00:08:40.206\nthe advanced settings, and\ngo in here and tweak settings there.\n\n177\n00:08:40.206 --> 00:08:42.735\nYou'll see there's a lot of\ndifferent things that we can modify.\n\n178\n00:08:42.735 --> 00:08:45.948\nBut the one thing that we don't see\nhere that it's letting me modify is that\n\n179\n00:08:45.948 --> 00:08:46.919\nport number, right?\n\n180\n00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:50.091\nEverything here is kinda\ntied to that port number.\n\n181\n00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:55.203\nBut I can add in a new name, and\npunch in a different port number,\n\n182\n00:08:55.203 --> 00:08:58.344\nlike 8080 or something like that.\n\n183\n00:08:58.344 --> 00:09:02.022\nAnd now my website can exist\non a different port number,\n\n184\n00:09:02.022 --> 00:09:04.760\nthat gives us a lot of flexibility there,\n\n185\n00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.688\ncuz you can host more than one\nwebsite from the same server.\n\n186\n00:09:08.688 --> 00:09:11.453\nI'm gonna have one server that\nhosts 20 different websites,\n\n187\n00:09:11.453 --> 00:09:13.585\neach with a different port number.\n\n188\n00:09:13.585 --> 00:09:16.405\nNow for a user to browse to a site\nthey'd have to know the port number, so\n\n189\n00:09:16.405 --> 00:09:17.725\nthat's not the best way to do it.\n\n190\n00:09:17.725 --> 00:09:21.985\nThere's other ways to do it with name\naliases that are a lot easier, but\n\n191\n00:09:21.985 --> 00:09:23.834\nthis is one method of doing it.\n\n192\n00:09:23.834 --> 00:09:24.467\nAll right.\n\n193\n00:09:24.467 --> 00:09:26.143\nSo notice when I come in here,\n\n194\n00:09:26.143 --> 00:09:30.047\nthese are actually considered two\ndifferent websites, all right?\n\n195\n00:09:30.047 --> 00:09:32.790\nThe regular website and\nthe encrypted website.\n\n196\n00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:38.041\nAnd if I edit those,\nI can see Store Site Files in default.\n\n197\n00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:40.631\nSo, these are just stored\nin the default location.\n\n198\n00:09:40.631 --> 00:09:44.405\nAnd if I take a look at that other site,\nthe unencrypted one,\n\n199\n00:09:44.405 --> 00:09:47.002\nit's set to store site files in default.\n\n200\n00:09:47.002 --> 00:09:50.025\nSo, they're storing their\nfiles in the same place and\n\n201\n00:09:50.025 --> 00:09:52.468\nthat means it's gonna\nbe the same web page.\n\n202\n00:09:52.468 --> 00:09:54.126\nAs we create our own servers in here,\n\n203\n00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:56.331\nyou can store the files\nin different locations.\n\n204\n00:09:56.331 --> 00:09:59.233\nSo you can have a custom name,\nwith a custom directory and\n\n205\n00:09:59.233 --> 00:10:01.661\na completely separate\nsite based on that name.\n\n206\n00:10:01.661 --> 00:10:05.176\n>> Now Don, you said there were\na few different services that used\n\n207\n00:10:05.176 --> 00:10:06.914\nthe web server or used Apache.\n\n208\n00:10:06.914 --> 00:10:10.371\nHow is it that a single machine\nknows that well, hey this is for\n\n209\n00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:13.911\ncalendar, and hey this is for\nwiki, and this is for websites?\n\n210\n00:10:13.911 --> 00:10:17.310\nHow does it know which\nservice is provided?\n\n211\n00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.722\n>> So it's really based on the port\nnumber that's happening right?\n\n212\n00:10:19.722 --> 00:10:22.860\nSo let me show you a quick example,\nProfile Manager, right?\n\n213\n00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.581\nIf you watched our Profile Manager\nepisode you'd know it's got a web based\n\n214\n00:10:25.581 --> 00:10:28.099\nadministration panel, so\nif I come in here and turn that on, right.\n\n215\n00:10:28.099 --> 00:10:32.787\nSo I'm gonna go under my website here,\nI'll go down to Profile Manager.\n\n216\n00:10:32.787 --> 00:10:34.962\nSo, I'm just in the server\napp going to Profile Manager.\n\n217\n00:10:34.962 --> 00:10:36.502\nI'm not gonna tweak any of these settings.\n\n218\n00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:38.611\nI'm just gonna turn the thing on.\n\n219\n00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:40.492\nAnd so now,\nI'm gonna run the Profile Manager.\n\n220\n00:10:40.492 --> 00:10:42.921\nWell, the Profile Manager is\na web-based management page.\n\n221\n00:10:42.921 --> 00:10:45.060\nSo, it needs a web server.\n\n222\n00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.900\nWe've already got a web server, right?\n\n223\n00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:51.750\nSo, how can I run a regular web server and\nthe Profile Manager at the same time?\n\n224\n00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.730\nWell the way it does it is down here,\n\n225\n00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.700\nif I click the link to connect\nto the Profile Manager,\n\n226\n00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.668\nit's gonna fire up Safari and it's gonna\nload the Profile Manager's webpage, right?\n\n227\n00:11:01.668 --> 00:11:03.330\nSo here it goes, loading it up.\n\n228\n00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.634\nAnd if I look up here I just\nsee my server name, right?\n\n229\n00:11:05.634 --> 00:11:10.370\nSo I see osx-server01.local, and\nhere's the log in screen for it, right?\n\n230\n00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:15.623\nBut if I click on the bar to see\nwhat's actually up there, well,\n\n231\n00:11:15.623 --> 00:11:21.870\nit's got osx-server01.local/auth?redirect\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n232\n00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:25.551\nAnd then it's look for\nthis /devicemanagement folder.\n\n233\n00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:30.806\nWhat it's done, it has created an alias,\na sub-directory alias.\n\n234\n00:11:30.806 --> 00:11:35.804\nSo, I browse to the server on port 80 but\nbecause I went to /devicemanager,\n\n235\n00:11:35.804 --> 00:11:38.712\nit is redirecting me to\nthe Profile Manager.\n\n236\n00:11:38.712 --> 00:11:41.500\nAnd if I left that /devicemanager off,\n\n237\n00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.453\nthen it would go to\nthe regular web server.\n\n238\n00:11:44.453 --> 00:11:52.100\nIf I were to just type in here,\nlet me just get to, http://osx-server01.\n\n239\n00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.595\nSo if were to just browse to my regular\nold server with nothing else special in\n\n240\n00:11:56.595 --> 00:12:01.249\nthat line, just browsing to the name,\nI'm gonna get the regular web server.\n\n241\n00:12:01.249 --> 00:12:03.679\nAnd what you'll notice is\nit's just kinda sitting here.\n\n242\n00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:05.670\nIt's trying,\nsee my little status bar is moving?\n\n243\n00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.612\nAnd that's probably cuz I never\nactually turned the web server on.\n\n244\n00:12:08.612 --> 00:12:10.034\nThat'll probably make a big difference,\nright?\n\n245\n00:12:10.034 --> 00:12:14.141\nSo, let me jump back here and\nI'm gonna go to my websites.\n\n246\n00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:16.591\nAnd I'm gonna flip that\non switch to turn it on.\n\n247\n00:12:16.591 --> 00:12:20.260\nThat's gonna turn it on which is gonna\nenable my default website, okay?\n\n248\n00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.508\nSo now, if I go back to my web browser.\n\n249\n00:12:22.508 --> 00:12:25.454\nAnd I'm just gonna try,\nand re-browse to it again.\n\n250\n00:12:25.454 --> 00:12:28.650\nThis time it'll browse to it,\nit's trying to resolve the name.\n\n251\n00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:33.332\nLet me just do it by IP and\nwe'll browse, there we go.\n\n252\n00:12:33.332 --> 00:12:37.750\nWhat we get is the default OS 10 webpage.\n\n253\n00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.401\nSo this is the default,\nregular, old web server.\n\n254\n00:12:41.401 --> 00:12:45.589\nAnd so I see it, and see how it's links\nfor Profile Manager, and the Wiki, and\n\n255\n00:12:45.589 --> 00:12:47.001\nXcode, and my settings.\n\n256\n00:12:47.001 --> 00:12:49.537\nThese are all things being hosted\non the same web server but\n\n257\n00:12:49.537 --> 00:12:51.080\nin different sub-directories.\n\n258\n00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:56.360\nSo that's one way, then we can have more\nthan one service using the website and\n\n259\n00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.083\nit'll all be nested under one service.\n\n260\n00:12:59.083 --> 00:13:01.940\nBut what if I want them\nto separate services?\n\n261\n00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:06.309\nWhat if I wanna have an intranet site\nthat's only available to my internal users\n\n262\n00:13:06.309 --> 00:13:09.960\nand then I wanna have my website\nthat's available to everybody out\n\n263\n00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.020\nthere on the Internet?\n\n264\n00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:18.479\nWell, I can achieve that by using either\naliases or different port numbers.\n\n265\n00:13:18.479 --> 00:13:20.792\nWe have two different ways\nto kinda solve that problem.\n\n266\n00:13:20.792 --> 00:13:23.905\nThe sub-directory alias, that's one way,\ndomain aliases are another.\n\n267\n00:13:23.905 --> 00:13:25.590\nLet me go back to my server app.\n\n268\n00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.652\nAnd when we look right here,\nwhat we see are these default websites.\n\n269\n00:13:30.652 --> 00:13:34.980\nAnd see how it says Address,\nAll IP addresses.\n\n270\n00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.100\nI might have more than one\nnetwork adapter in my machine.\n\n271\n00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.051\nAnd I could say this website is\ntied to this network adapter and\n\n272\n00:13:41.051 --> 00:13:43.855\nthis other website is tied to\nthis other network adapter.\n\n273\n00:13:43.855 --> 00:13:47.660\nNow they have their own IP addresses and\nthey're separate based on IP.\n\n274\n00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.334\nOr they could share an IP and\nhave different port numbers, right?\n\n275\n00:13:52.334 --> 00:13:55.415\nSo, different options are available for\nhow we wanna handle that.\n\n276\n00:13:55.415 --> 00:14:00.169\nIf I go and add another website, it's\ngonna ask me for a domain name, right?\n\n277\n00:14:00.169 --> 00:14:01.337\nWhat's the domain name gonna be?\n\n278\n00:14:01.337 --> 00:14:04.695\nMaybe this is lab.itpro.tv, okay?\n\n279\n00:14:04.695 --> 00:14:06.515\nThat's gonna be my site.\n\n280\n00:14:06.515 --> 00:14:10.052\nAnd notice up here,\nwhere's it gonna store it?\n\n281\n00:14:10.052 --> 00:14:15.880\n/Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites and\nthere's the site that I'm creating, right?\n\n282\n00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.205\nNow the default site,\nthis is now it's own site.\n\n283\n00:14:19.205 --> 00:14:23.236\nFor IP address, if I was gonna tie it to a\nspecific network adapter I could choose it\n\n284\n00:14:23.236 --> 00:14:24.943\nfrom the drop down box right here.\n\n285\n00:14:24.943 --> 00:14:28.801\nEach site could have its own IP and\nnow they're separated by IP address.\n\n286\n00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:31.972\nBut I've only got one IP address,\nso I can't really do that, can I?\n\n287\n00:14:31.972 --> 00:14:36.400\nSo, I've already got a web server\non port 80 on this system.\n\n288\n00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.331\nSo maybe I wanna make this one port 8080,\njust give me a different port number.\n\n289\n00:14:41.331 --> 00:14:41.870\nSo now,\n\n290\n00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:47.263\nI'll be able to tell this apart from the\nother based on that different port number.\n\n291\n00:14:47.263 --> 00:14:50.602\nIf I want it to support SSL,\nI could punch in my SSL Certificate here.\n\n292\n00:14:50.602 --> 00:14:52.883\nI've got one, but\nI'm gonna leave it off for now.\n\n293\n00:14:52.883 --> 00:14:55.793\nAnd I can choose to move the site's\ndirectory somewhere else.\n\n294\n00:14:55.793 --> 00:14:57.548\nIf I don't wanna store it here,\n\n295\n00:14:57.548 --> 00:15:01.199\nI could move it somewhere else by\nchanging this option right here.\n\n296\n00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:04.875\nThen we start to get into permissions,\nwho's allowed to access it and\n\n297\n00:15:04.875 --> 00:15:06.520\nother settings, right?\n\n298\n00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.441\nSo, what are these other settings?\n\n299\n00:15:07.441 --> 00:15:10.351\nWell, additional domains.\n\n300\n00:15:10.351 --> 00:15:12.901\nRight now it's called lab.itpro.tv.\n\n301\n00:15:12.901 --> 00:15:18.067\nMaybe I also want to add another name\n\n302\n00:15:18.067 --> 00:15:23.240\nof www.lab.itpro.tv, right?\n\n303\n00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:28.510\nThat way, if somebody types either name,\nthey're gonna get this site, right?\n\n304\n00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:33.182\nNow this is the only server on port 8080,\nbut if I had more than one site on port\n\n305\n00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:37.123\n8080 we could use these aliases\nto tell them apart, all right.\n\n306\n00:15:37.123 --> 00:15:41.014\nThat's a very effective way to have\nmultiple hosts stored on one IP.\n\n307\n00:15:41.014 --> 00:15:44.647\nIt's always better to have multiple IP's\nif you can but most of us don't have a ton\n\n308\n00:15:44.647 --> 00:15:47.344\nof external IP's just laying\naround to use however we want.\n\n309\n00:15:47.344 --> 00:15:51.614\nSo, having multiple aliases on\none IP can help to reduce that.\n\n310\n00:15:51.614 --> 00:15:55.203\nWe can do redirects, if somebody comes\nto this page, maybe this is our old web\n\n311\n00:15:55.203 --> 00:15:58.811\nserver and I wanna redirect them to our\nnew web server, so I can do a redirect.\n\n312\n00:15:58.811 --> 00:16:01.320\nWe can also configure those other aliases.\n\n313\n00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:05.964\nHere, I did www.lab.itpro.tv\nas an additional domain but\n\n314\n00:16:05.964 --> 00:16:09.992\nI might have aliases,\nlike this is lab.itpro.tv.\n\n315\n00:16:09.992 --> 00:16:14.153\nMaybe it's also www or\nsomething like that and here,\n\n316\n00:16:14.153 --> 00:16:17.677\nwe can do the URL matching\nthat we saw before.\n\n317\n00:16:17.677 --> 00:16:22.252\nWhere like /, what was it, devicemanager,\npointed to a different folder, and\n\n318\n00:16:22.252 --> 00:16:23.843\nthen slash this slash that,\n\n319\n00:16:23.843 --> 00:16:28.170\nwe create these virtual directories\nto point to different places.\n\n320\n00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.730\nThis is basically saying when\nusers visit a URL that matches,\n\n321\n00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:34.660\nso if they type a URL that matches this,\nwhere do I send them?\n\n322\n00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.660\nOr we can change that and we can do\na regular expression like wild cards.\n\n323\n00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.150\nIf they do a URL that\nstarts with something,\n\n324\n00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.970\nthen send them to this other place.\n\n325\n00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:44.420\nSo you've got a lot of power here,\n\n326\n00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.760\nwith how you wanna do\nthese virtual directories.\n\n327\n00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.710\nSo, for me,\n/images might actually be a completely\n\n328\n00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:55.180\ndifferent location on my hard-drive\nthan where the web server is,\n\n329\n00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.180\nall my images might be\nstored somewhere else.\n\n330\n00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:03.226\nSo I could come in and find out where that\nis, maybe it's my pictures folder, right?\n\n331\n00:17:03.226 --> 00:17:06.879\nSo now, if somebody goes to\nlab.itpro.tv/pictures, or\n\n332\n00:17:06.879 --> 00:17:10.900\n/images, then they'll get\nthe content of this folder, right?\n\n333\n00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.038\nSo we're creating an alias based on that,\nand\n\n334\n00:17:14.038 --> 00:17:17.911\nthat's what the profile manager\nwas using a moment ago.\n\n335\n00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:21.270\nAnd then the index files, by default,\nwe've got three index files.\n\n336\n00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:25.680\nThere's index.html, which is kind\nof the Internet standard for HTTP.\n\n337\n00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.576\nThere's index.php if you're\ngonna be using that, and\n\n338\n00:17:28.576 --> 00:17:31.798\nthen default.html that actually\ncame from Microsoft world.\n\n339\n00:17:31.798 --> 00:17:35.210\nThey use default.html and so,\nthey've added it here too, but\n\n340\n00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:37.960\nyou can add whatever you want\nhere to be the default page.\n\n341\n00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.430\nIf somebody just types your server name,\n\n342\n00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:42.140\nthis is the page that's\ngonna be given to them.\n\n343\n00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.830\nIt's gonna look for these and\nit does look in this order.\n\n344\n00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:50.060\nSo index.html is the one it's\ngonna prefer, and then php next.\n\n345\n00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:54.750\nIf you know that php is what you're gonna\nbe using, you can just drag that and\n\n346\n00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.300\nplace it at the top, which is easier\nsaid than done apparently, there we go.\n\n347\n00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.010\nAnd you can get that index.php\nright at the top and now,\n\n348\n00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.680\nthat'll be the default\ndocument it goes to.\n\n349\n00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.920\nIn fact, if you know you're not\ngonna use these others at all,\n\n350\n00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.570\nyou can just get rid of them and now,\nthat's the only one you got, all right?\n\n351\n00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.938\nWell, I actually am gonna use index.html,,\nso I'm gonna put that back, and\n\n352\n00:18:11.938 --> 00:18:13.172\nI'll just say okay to that.\n\n353\n00:18:13.172 --> 00:18:16.600\nAll right, so once that's done,\n\n354\n00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:21.040\nI've now created a site that's on this\nport, this alternate port number.\n\n355\n00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.710\nSo, I'm gonna create that and\n\n356\n00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:26.570\nit's building it's putting the files\nin place and it's getting it ready.\n\n357\n00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:28.733\nSo as soon as that's done, there we go.\n\n358\n00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:31.160\nNow, when I browse to my server,\n\n359\n00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:35.513\nI could browse to the server itself and\nI'm gonna get this.\n\n360\n00:18:35.513 --> 00:18:39.077\nThe default page or\nI could browse to the server, and\n\n361\n00:18:39.077 --> 00:18:45.060\nlet me type this all the way out\nhttp://127.0.0.1 that's my loopback.\n\n362\n00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:51.540\nPoints to myself, :8080 and now,\nwhen I browse to it, what do I get?\n\n363\n00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.940\nYou don't have permission\nto access on this server.\n\n364\n00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.190\nI've accessed an empty folder,\nthere's nothing in there and\n\n365\n00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:58.910\nI'm not allowed to list the contents.\n\n366\n00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:02.661\nSo it's a blank site, I really need to put\nsomething in there, to make it exciting.\n\n367\n00:19:02.661 --> 00:19:06.689\nAll right, well, we can put something\nin there, I've take a course or\n\n368\n00:19:06.689 --> 00:19:09.795\ntwo on basic HTML, so\nwe can throw something in there.\n\n369\n00:19:09.795 --> 00:19:13.314\nLets fire up my trusty terminal, whoops,\n\n370\n00:19:13.314 --> 00:19:17.430\nfire up the terminal on my\nserver not on my laptop.\n\n371\n00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.998\nAnd I'm gonna whip up a quick and\ndirty webpage.\n\n372\n00:19:21.998 --> 00:19:25.326\nNow, I will tell you guys that there are\nweb developers out there that are super\n\n373\n00:19:25.326 --> 00:19:27.257\ntalented and\nI am absolutely not one of them.\n\n374\n00:19:27.257 --> 00:19:32.261\nSo I'm gonna keep this super basic,\nbut the first thing I need to do is\n\n375\n00:19:32.261 --> 00:19:37.096\nget into the directory where my\nweb server is storing everything,\n\n376\n00:19:37.096 --> 00:19:41.960\nso that's /Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites,\nall right.\n\n377\n00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.605\nSo this is where all of my sites are and\nI got two sites,\n\n378\n00:19:45.605 --> 00:19:48.080\nthe default site and the lab.\n\n379\n00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:54.540\nIf I go in, look inside of the default\nsite, you'll see all these default files.\n\n380\n00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.015\nThey're language localized, right?\n\n381\n00:19:56.015 --> 00:19:58.690\nSo there's French, Italian and so on.\n\n382\n00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:03.310\nThis is the default website, and\ninside of it, I'm seeing all these\n\n383\n00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:07.099\nHTML files that are what's gonna be\nrendered by default from info.php.\n\n384\n00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:12.340\nBut, in my new site, in lab.itpro.tv,\n\n385\n00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:16.620\nwhen I look in there, well,\nI've got those defaults also.\n\n386\n00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.295\nBut notice how I'm missing the one\nthat ties it all together,\n\n387\n00:20:19.295 --> 00:20:22.083\nup here it was info.php that made\nsure that I got the right page.\n\n388\n00:20:22.083 --> 00:20:25.655\nI don't have an info.php here, I just have\nall these language files, and that's it.\n\n389\n00:20:25.655 --> 00:20:29.371\nAnd in fact, I don't even want those,\nso I'm just gonna get rid of all that.\n\n390\n00:20:29.371 --> 00:20:32.701\nSo let me just get rid, oops,\n\n391\n00:20:32.701 --> 00:20:37.366\nlet me do a -y on that, oops, or a -f.\n\n392\n00:20:37.366 --> 00:20:39.820\n[LAUGH] ownership.\n\n393\n00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.190\nOwnership is important, these files have\npermissions that are set to them, so\n\n394\n00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.060\nI was just looking at the files.\n\n395\n00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:49.980\nLet me do an LS-LA and show you guys that\nall of these files are actually links.\n\n396\n00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.060\nSee how they're linked\nto a central location?\n\n397\n00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:56.770\nAnd they're owned by root, so\nI'm not allowed to mess with them.\n\n398\n00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:01.760\nI'm gonna have to sudo,\nto get rid of those, and\n\n399\n00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.000\nso let me do that, and now it's empty.\n\n400\n00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.210\nOkay, so now, I can put my files in,\n\n401\n00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.150\nalways a good idea to get\nrid of the default files.\n\n402\n00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.040\nIf you're not gonna use them,\n\n403\n00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.260\nget rid of them, because if there's\nsome kind of flaw in those files,\n\n404\n00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.140\nit's something an attacker can take\nadvantage of, so just get rid of them.\n\n405\n00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:20.361\nI'm gonna create my own and\nI'm gonna create index.html, all right?\n\n406\n00:21:20.361 --> 00:21:24.528\nAnd in this file,\nI'm gonna add a little bit of HTML.\n\n407\n00:21:24.528 --> 00:21:28.702\nAnd like I said, I'm not any kind of\nweb developer, master, or anything, so\n\n408\n00:21:28.702 --> 00:21:30.678\nlet me just try and keep this simple.\n\n409\n00:21:30.678 --> 00:21:35.528\nSo I'm gonna create a HTML\nfile with a heading and\n\n410\n00:21:35.528 --> 00:21:40.750\nthe title will be something\nlike Example HTML Page.\n\n411\n00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:49.745\nAnd that should be enough for\na heading and then we need a body.\n\n412\n00:21:49.745 --> 00:21:55.159\nI'll try and not mess this up too bad, and\n\n413\n00:21:55.159 --> 00:22:03.225\nI'm just gonna say this text\nis rendered using HTML, there.\n\n414\n00:22:03.225 --> 00:22:06.920\nAnd we'll close that out and\nwe'll close out the HTML.\n\n415\n00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.900\nThere we go,\nthis is a super simple webpage.\n\n416\n00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:13.187\nIt's just gonna display some text that'll\nsay this text is rendered using HTML, and\n\n417\n00:22:13.187 --> 00:22:13.849\nthat's it.\n\n418\n00:22:13.849 --> 00:22:17.718\nRight, so just real simple file,\nnothing too special there,\n\n419\n00:22:17.718 --> 00:22:23.849\nand, Can't open file for writing, what?\n\n420\n00:22:23.849 --> 00:22:27.365\nSo I'm in a directory that I\ndon't have permissions to,\n\n421\n00:22:27.365 --> 00:22:31.703\nand so I should have remembered to\nsudo that command also and I forgot.\n\n422\n00:22:31.703 --> 00:22:33.060\nSo let me just paste that.\n\n423\n00:22:34.767 --> 00:22:35.760\nThere we go.\n\n424\n00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.900\nAll right, so now I've gotta index.html\nfile, it's got some text in it.\n\n425\n00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.700\nI should be able to render that page.\n\n426\n00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.570\nNow, I might need to be\ncareful with my permissions.\n\n427\n00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:48.930\nIn this case, I'm all right, it's got root\nand admin because I used sudo to do it.\n\n428\n00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:52.030\nIf you move the file there some other way,\nyou might be the owner instead of root,\n\n429\n00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.870\nand so\nyou might need to change ownership of it.\n\n430\n00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:58.050\nYou can use the chown command but\nin my case, everything's set fine.\n\n431\n00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:02.319\nWe'll see if it works, so\nI'm gonna go back to good old Safari.\n\n432\n00:23:02.319 --> 00:23:07.100\nAnd on Safari, a moment ago when I\nbrowsed here, I got this access denied.\n\n433\n00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:11.420\nNow when I browse, I get this text\nis rendered using HTML, right.\n\n434\n00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:16.810\nSo I'm a valid web server, I'm up,\nI'm on port 8080 and there's the content.\n\n435\n00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:18.310\nBut if I get rid of that port 8080 and\n\n436\n00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:22.490\nI just browse to the server,\nI get the default page.\n\n437\n00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.418\nI've got two different websites running\non the same server separated by\n\n438\n00:23:25.418 --> 00:23:26.188\nthe port numbers.\n\n439\n00:23:26.188 --> 00:23:28.673\nSo, easy enough to do and on my firewall,\n\n440\n00:23:28.673 --> 00:23:32.443\nI can set it where only internal\nusers can get to port 8080.\n\n441\n00:23:32.443 --> 00:23:34.899\nAnd everybody else on the Internet\ncan just get to port 80,\n\n442\n00:23:34.899 --> 00:23:35.920\nget to the regular site.\n\n443\n00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.660\nNow I got an internal and an external\nsite separated out by those port numbers.\n\n444\n00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.510\nThe only negative here is my internal\nusers, you have to remember to type in\n\n445\n00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:47.700\nthat 8080 as part of the server name, and\na lot of them are not gonna remember that.\n\n446\n00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.550\nSo that's where its better to\nbind it to a separate IP address.\n\n447\n00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:55.008\nThen we can just use a DNS name,\nI could have intranet.itpro.tv.\n\n448\n00:23:55.008 --> 00:23:59.499\nThat points to an IP that's internal\nonly And I could have www.itpro.tv,\n\n449\n00:23:59.499 --> 00:24:03.860\nwhich is what the world sees and\npoints to a publicly accessible address.\n\n450\n00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.070\nSo a little bit of flexibility there.\n\n451\n00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.017\nAll right, now the page that I\njust made was basic HTML, right.\n\n452\n00:24:09.017 --> 00:24:13.066\nBut we saw back in the server app,\nif I jump back over to it,\n\n453\n00:24:13.066 --> 00:24:15.950\nthat we can enable PHP if we want.\n\n454\n00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:17.260\nIt's off by default.\n\n455\n00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.454\nBut if we turn it on,\nnow we can put dynamic pages,\n\n456\n00:24:20.454 --> 00:24:23.816\npages that are generated for\nour users at that time.\n\n457\n00:24:23.816 --> 00:24:27.090\nSo I'm gonna turn that on just\nby checking the little box.\n\n458\n00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.270\nAnd technically, you don't have to.\n\n459\n00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:32.224\nBut I find that it's generally better\nif you turn the server off and\n\n460\n00:24:32.224 --> 00:24:34.191\nturn it back on again,\nwhen you turn on PHP.\n\n461\n00:24:34.191 --> 00:24:35.960\nSo I'm just gonna do that.\n\n462\n00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.430\nSo I'm turning it off, and\nthen I'll turn it back on again.\n\n463\n00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:43.320\nThat's going to allow me to put\nPHP documents on my server.\n\n464\n00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:47.400\nAnd so now if I go and\ncreate a PHP file I'll be able to use it.\n\n465\n00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:55.500\nSo I'm going to create\na file called test.php.\n\n466\n00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:00.340\nAnd PHP files are written similar to, well\nactually, you know what, I can reuse, save\n\n467\n00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:06.480\nus a little screen time here, and reuse\nthe index that we created a second ago.\n\n468\n00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:12.433\nSo I'm going to copy\nthat index to test.php,\n\n469\n00:25:12.433 --> 00:25:16.000\nand we'll edit that.\n\n470\n00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:24.400\nNow the way that HTML works is we hand the\nHTML off to a client and what do they do?\n\n471\n00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.590\nThey render it into a web page, so\nit's really all done by the client.\n\n472\n00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:31.470\nWith PHP, the server actually\nassembles the HTML first.\n\n473\n00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:32.800\nAnd so I'm gonna come in here and\n\n474\n00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:37.900\nkinda tweak this a little bit to\nrender some text for us via PHP.\n\n475\n00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:42.720\nSo here where I've got,\nthis text is rendered using HTML.\n\n476\n00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.160\nThat's just in line, right?\n\n477\n00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.380\nSo I'm gonna come in and change that.\n\n478\n00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:51.770\nAnd instead of being a regular paragraph,\nI'm gonna use PHP to render it.\n\n479\n00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:57.180\nAnd in PHP what we can do is,\nwe can say something like, echo some text.\n\n480\n00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:02.114\nAnd the text I wanna echo is,\nthe paragraph marker,\n\n481\n00:26:02.114 --> 00:26:06.835\nand this text is rendered using,\nwe'll say PHP.\n\n482\n00:26:06.835 --> 00:26:08.356\nThere we go.\n\n483\n00:26:08.356 --> 00:26:09.559\nAnd I'll close that out.\n\n484\n00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:12.890\nAnd I'll close out my script,\n\n485\n00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:16.990\nwhich actually now that I think about it I\nhave an error way back at the beginning.\n\n486\n00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:21.800\nAll right, so what's happening\nhere is I'm calling PHP and\n\n487\n00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.490\nI'm telling it to echo\nsome text to the screen.\n\n488\n00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:27.230\nAnd the text that's echoing to\nthe screen is this message right here,\n\n489\n00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:30.820\nthe text is rendered using PHP,\nand then I close off my script.\n\n490\n00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.010\nThis is an executable script.\n\n491\n00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:35.320\nOn the server, we see the script.\n\n492\n00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.280\nAnd the script runs on the server.\n\n493\n00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:42.120\nSo the end user,\nthey see whatever we echo.\n\n494\n00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:42.790\nThis little blurb right here.\n\n495\n00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.480\nThey just see the HTML.\n\n496\n00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:48.339\nBut I can be pulling in variables querying\ntoday's date, querying a user name,\n\n497\n00:26:48.339 --> 00:26:51.010\npopulating, you can do all\nsorts of stuff with PHP.\n\n498\n00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:52.590\nThis isn't a programming show.\n\n499\n00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:54.320\nBut you can do a ton of stuff.\n\n500\n00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.554\nBut here I'm just managing this one line,\npulling it with PHP.\n\n501\n00:26:58.554 --> 00:27:00.280\nAll right, so let's see if this works.\n\n502\n00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.510\nWe'll see if I can write valid code.\n\n503\n00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:09.200\nSo I'm gonna go back to my browser, and\nwhen I browse to the server on 8080,\n\n504\n00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.890\nwhoops, which I can't type,\nso let me try that again.\n\n505\n00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:16.520\nThere we go, I get a message that\nthis text is rendered using HTML,\n\n506\n00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:21.210\nI'm just going to add to the end of that,\n/test.php.\n\n507\n00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:26.040\nAnd now I get,\nThis text is rendered using PHP.\n\n508\n00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.410\nAnd if I were to view\nthe source code of this page,\n\n509\n00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:32.010\nwhich does Safari let us\nview the source code?\n\n510\n00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:34.800\nA lot of browsers have that option.\n\n511\n00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.930\nI don't know if Safari lets us do it.\n\n512\n00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:42.370\nBut if we were to view the source code,\nwe actually won't see that PHP.\n\n513\n00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:48.390\nAll you'll see in here is HTML,\nwhat was echoed out by PHP, and that's it.\n\n514\n00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:53.390\nSo we get just that kinda simplified view,\nthe server did the work.\n\n515\n00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:56.640\nBut it was easy enough, we just checked\nthat PHP box and now we're running it.\n\n516\n00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.870\nAnd PHP needs updates,\njust like anything, so\n\n517\n00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:02.950\nyou need to make sure that you're\nrunning your updates on the server.\n\n518\n00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:04.730\nBecause Apache will get updated, and\n\n519\n00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:08.370\nApache will come along with PHP updates\nalso, and so those stay hand in hand.\n\n520\n00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:16.000\nAll right, so we've seen HTML,\nwe've seen PHP, we've created a website.\n\n521\n00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.470\nThose are the basics for\ngetting this up and going.\n\n522\n00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:22.370\nBe careful with port numbers because your\nend users have to remember to type in\n\n523\n00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:23.010\nthose port numbers.\n\n524\n00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:24.590\nThat can always be a challenge.\n\n525\n00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:26.800\nBe careful with DNS aliases.\n\n526\n00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.638\nSo for example, when I come in and\nI add a website and attach it to an IP,\n\n527\n00:28:30.638 --> 00:28:33.610\nI need some kind of DNS\nalias that ties it to that.\n\n528\n00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:35.734\nSo for example,\nlet me show you real quick.\n\n529\n00:28:35.734 --> 00:28:37.528\nI made lab.itpro.tv, but\n\n530\n00:28:37.528 --> 00:28:42.552\nif somebody were to type in lab.itpro.tv\nright now, what are they gonna get?\n\n531\n00:28:42.552 --> 00:28:43.570\nThey're gonna get nothing.\n\n532\n00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:45.840\nI need DNS to go along with it, right?\n\n533\n00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:50.520\nSo when I look at lab.itpro.tv, it's\ntied to all IP addresses on this server.\n\n534\n00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.916\nI've only got one IP address.\n\n535\n00:28:51.916 --> 00:28:55.740\nBut I would need to go into DNS,\nwherever I'm hosting that,\n\n536\n00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.270\nwhich might be right here,\nit might be on a public service.\n\n537\n00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:02.685\nBut I would need to go into DNS, and\nI would need to create an entry for\n\n538\n00:29:02.685 --> 00:29:08.840\nlab.itpro.tv that pointed to\nthis server's IP address.\n\n539\n00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.430\nNow DNS will only point to IP addresses.\n\n540\n00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:14.511\nIt can't point to port numbers, right.\n\n541\n00:29:14.511 --> 00:29:18.820\nSo if I put this in here, and I create it.\n\n542\n00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.700\nNow, somebody will be\nable to do a lookup and\n\n543\n00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.545\nthey'll be able to find\nout about lab.itpro.tv.\n\n544\n00:29:24.545 --> 00:29:27.880\nBut they won't necessarily know\nto put in the port number, so\n\n545\n00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.690\nthat's where that becomes\na bit of a challenge.\n\n546\n00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:32.215\nSo the better option is if\nyou have more than one IP,\n\n547\n00:29:32.215 --> 00:29:35.860\ncuz then you can have the DNS for\neach site point to the different IPs, and\n\n548\n00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.595\nnow they're separated and\nnobody has to remember port numbers.\n\n549\n00:29:38.595 --> 00:29:40.980\nCuz everybody can be reusing port 80.\n\n550\n00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.898\nYou can have port 80 on 5\ndifferent IPs and it's fine.\n\n551\n00:29:43.898 --> 00:29:46.809\nSo, it definitely makes things a little\nsmoother as far as your end user\n\n552\n00:29:46.809 --> 00:29:47.422\nexperience.\n\n553\n00:29:47.422 --> 00:29:51.510\nAll right, otherwise I think that's\nabout it for the basic web server.\n\n554\n00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:54.330\nJust like all the other services you\ndo have your logs that you can look at.\n\n555\n00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:59.040\nIf i jump in to my logs up here,\nI can filter my service logs and\n\n556\n00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.970\nI can filter it down to\njust the web servers.\n\n557\n00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:03.280\nSo if I filter that and\nI come in and look,\n\n558\n00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:08.430\nnow notice on the websites we actually\nhave logs for each of the different sites.\n\n559\n00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.640\nHere's lab.itpro.tv as\nwell as the default site.\n\n560\n00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:16.080\nSo those are in there, and I can go and\npull just the access log for\n\n561\n00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.450\nthe lab site that I just created.\n\n562\n00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:21.270\nSo you can see already clients connecting\nto it, and I can pull up the error log,\n\n563\n00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:23.240\nwhich hopefully I don't have any errors.\n\n564\n00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:29.065\nBut if I had written bad PHP, the errors\nthat PHP generates would be right in here.\n\n565\n00:30:29.065 --> 00:30:32.145\nAnd I would see those,\nin fact maybe I did make an error.\n\n566\n00:30:32.145 --> 00:30:34.355\nSo, let's see.\n\n567\n00:30:34.355 --> 00:30:35.475\nNo, these are just core notices.\n\n568\n00:30:35.475 --> 00:30:37.615\nThis is just it creating the log files.\n\n569\n00:30:37.615 --> 00:30:40.911\nSo when it starts up, it ties it to\na log file and that's all these are.\n\n570\n00:30:40.911 --> 00:30:42.269\nOoh, actually that's\na bad one right there.\n\n571\n00:30:42.269 --> 00:30:44.925\nWhen, did that happen today?\n\n572\n00:30:44.925 --> 00:30:49.590\n[LAUGH] Just real world kind of example\nhere,if you ever see a SIGTERM like this\n\n573\n00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:55.110\nright, that's a signal termination,\nand it means that a program crashed.\n\n574\n00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:57.668\nEvery PHP page that you write\nis technically a program,\n\n575\n00:30:57.668 --> 00:30:58.927\nit runs in the background.\n\n576\n00:30:58.927 --> 00:31:02.970\nAnd so something ran and\ncrashed, and that's not good.\n\n577\n00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:05.450\nSo, that's telling me I've got a problem.\n\n578\n00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:09.990\nMy PHP, I might have had a non-terminating\ncharacter or something like that.\n\n579\n00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:11.980\nAnd so I'm getting a SIGTERM.\n\n580\n00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:16.150\nI can ignore it, except if you look,\nI've got another SIGTERM right here.\n\n581\n00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:16.950\nAnd another one here.\n\n582\n00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.930\nSo it's happening over and\nover and over again.\n\n583\n00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:23.730\nWhich more than likely means I wrote some\nbad PHP and I need to troubleshoot it.\n\n584\n00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:27.230\nFortunately, you've got a log\nthat you can jump into and look,\n\n585\n00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:32.980\nthe Apache error log right here,\n/var/log/apache2/error_log.\n\n586\n00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.780\nAnd so I can always go and\ntake a look at that and try and\n\n587\n00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.490\nget an idea of what is going on.\n\n588\n00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:43.370\nAnd it actually looks like it's\nshowing me pretty much the same thing.\n\n589\n00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:44.420\nSo not a lot of detail there.\n\n590\n00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:47.690\nSo I'm gonna need to add\nsome debug code to my PHP\n\n591\n00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:50.400\nto be able to find out where\nthat's actually crashing out.\n\n592\n00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.230\nBut I can see here that\nbasically it's crashing.\n\n593\n00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.670\nAnd then you've got this\nresuming normal operations,\n\n594\n00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:57.940\nwhere it's basically restarting Apache.\n\n595\n00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.109\nThat's a problem.\n\n596\n00:31:59.109 --> 00:32:01.550\nIt's a developer problem,\nnot my problem, fortunately.\n\n597\n00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:03.470\nSo you turn it over to them and\nlet them find out.\n\n598\n00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:09.260\nBut basically, the web server is a fully\nfunctional installation of Apache and\n\n599\n00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.040\nyou fill your web pages in there,\nit'll serve them up.\n\n600\n00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:11.730\nIt does a pretty good job.\n\n601\n00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:13.720\n>> A lot of great information, Don.\n\n602\n00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.080\nAnd thank you for pushing the ends\nof your development knowledge there.\n\n603\n00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.940\nBut I do see that we are running\nto the end of another episode.\n\n604\n00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.670\nBut we before sign out,\nyou got any additional words?\n\n605\n00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:25.920\n>> What I showed you right\nthere was super basic, right.\n\n606\n00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.684\nWe did HTML, we did PHP, and that was it.\n\n607\n00:32:28.684 --> 00:32:32.084\nSome of you are gonna wanna do bigger\nthings, like throw WordPress in there, or\n\n608\n00:32:32.084 --> 00:32:33.526\nall sorts of crazy other things.\n\n609\n00:32:33.526 --> 00:32:35.097\nAnd you certainly can do that.\n\n610\n00:32:35.097 --> 00:32:37.129\nThe functionality is there for\nyou to do it.\n\n611\n00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:42.910\nBut you'll bump into\nthings where like Apple\n\n612\n00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:45.650\ndoesn't necessarily run\nthe latest version of Apache.\n\n613\n00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:48.226\nThey don't necessarily run\nthe latest version of PHP.\n\n614\n00:32:48.226 --> 00:32:51.694\nSo if you really need the latest\nversions of those softwares,\n\n615\n00:32:51.694 --> 00:32:56.150\nyou might not want to use the website\nthat's built into the server app.\n\n616\n00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:59.250\nInstead, you might want to install\nsomething like the Homebrew\n\n617\n00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:02.000\nservice into Apple, into OS X.\n\n618\n00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.640\nAnd you can get the latest\nversion of Apache and MySQL, and\n\n619\n00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:10.000\nall those other services that are a part\nof whatever your web application is.\n\n620\n00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.550\nSo, just understand that this is\ngreat as a basic web server, but\n\n621\n00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.290\nwhen you wanna start\ngetting more advanced,\n\n622\n00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:19.030\nApple doesn't provide any support on this,\nand so you're kind of left to your own.\n\n623\n00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:21.250\nDon't hesitate to move away\nfrom this web server and\n\n624\n00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.490\njust natively install\nApache on the system.\n\n625\n00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:26.240\nUse Brew to do that,\nit'll make life a lot easier for you.\n\n626\n00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.840\n>> Well, Don, we thank you for\nthat information.\n\n627\n00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.610\nWe thank you the viewer for joining\nus today but we're gonna go ahead and\n\n628\n00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:32.340\nsign out here at

00:00:16.313\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\n\n4\n00:00:16.313 --> 00:00:21.220\nin today's episode we're continuing\nthrough our OS X server essentials series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.770\nAnd today we're looking at\nproviding network services.\n\n6\n00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.902\nMore specifically we're looking\nat advanced web server.\n\n7\n00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:29.595\nJoining me in the studio today is\nnone other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:30.775\nDon, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:30.775 --> 00:00:31.865\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.975\nReady to jump right back into\nthe wacky world of web services.\n\n11\n00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:37.765\nIn our last episode, we had a chance\nto see the web server that's\n\n12\n00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:40.275\nbuilt into the server app as part of OS X.\n\n13\n00:00:40.275 --> 00:00:42.499\nAnd that web server, it's Apache so\n\n14\n00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:47.541\nit's an open-source web server that's\nused by tons of systems across the world.\n\n15\n00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:51.050\nAnd we just saw the basic configuration.\n\n16\n00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.780\nHow to get a web server up and running and\nserve up some simple HTML or PHP pages.\n\n17\n00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.210\nBut in this episode,\n\n18\n00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.530\nI wanna go a little bit deeper into\nthat web server cuz there's some really\n\n19\n00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.780\nadvanced features that you can turn\non that are all off by default.\n\n20\n00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.600\nSo I just wanna run\nthrough what those are.\n\n21\n00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.800\nAnd then, I just want to show\nyou guys how to actually use it.\n\n22\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.220\nOn the exam, they want you to be familiar\nwith what each of the advanced options\n\n23\n00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.010\nare but they don't necessarily really\nhit you on how to truly use them.\n\n24\n00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.660\nAnd if you go out into the world,\n\n25\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.860\nthe documentation on this\nis actually really light.\n\n26\n00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.320\nApple hasn't done a great job documenting\nit because well, it's dance stuff,\n\n27\n00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.720\nthey figure you're already gonna know it.\n\n28\n00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.840\nSo I wanna show you guys an actual\nimplementation of how we can load\n\n29\n00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.740\nsomething like a server based\napplication into the web server and\n\n30\n00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.920\nget that fired up and going.\n\n31\n00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.010\nIt's a pretty neat process and we'll\nget a chance to see it all right here.\n\n32\n00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.670\nAll right, well let's pick things\nup kinda where we left off.\n\n33\n00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.520\nWe actually have an all new server\nto use on this episode from the one\n\n34\n00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.790\nthat I had in the last episode.\n\n35\n00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.980\nSo I've got a OS X Server up and that\njust means that its running El Capitan.\n\n36\n00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.501\nI'm running, I think I'm on 10.11.3,\n\n37\n00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:56.530\n10.11.5 is current, but\nthey're all the same.\n\n38\n00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.740\nSo I'm up and I'm running that one and I'm\nnot configured as a web server just yet.\n\n39\n00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.947\nSo if I look over here at my left bar,\nI can come down here and\n\n40\n00:02:05.947 --> 00:02:08.509\nfind websites and\nI don't have the green dot.\n\n41\n00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.670\nSo I'm not a web server.\n\n42\n00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.694\nAnd in our last episode, we walked\nthrough all these different options,\n\n43\n00:02:12.694 --> 00:02:14.340\nhow to get things configured.\n\n44\n00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.250\nI'm just gonna come in here and\nturn this thing on.\n\n45\n00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.820\nSo there we go.\n\n46\n00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.790\nSo now I'm up and\n\n47\n00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.400\nI'm running just the default web\nserver that's a part of my system.\n\n48\n00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.210\nNow notice how my available statement up\nhere says that it's OSX-SERVER01.local.\n\n49\n00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.500\nThat's my local name.\n\n50\n00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.590\nAnd my local name is not necessarily what\nI wanna serve my website up as, right.\n\n51\n00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.040\nSo I probably want to set something up\n\n52\n00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.860\nthat is named a little more\nappropriate from what this is.\n\n53\n00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.220\nNow, that name right there\nis actually being pulled\n\n54\n00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.220\nfrom the main server configuration.\n\n55\n00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.030\nSo if I go up here to OSX-SERVER01,\nI can look and\n\n56\n00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.660\nthere's my host name, OSX-SERVER01.Local.\n\n57\n00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.630\nSo that's where that name comes from and\nthat's where people are kinda seeing this.\n\n58\n00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.100\nNow, if I wanna change the name\nof the whole sever, I can.\n\n59\n00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.790\nIf I want this to be www.ITProTV.com,\n\n60\n00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.320\nI could change the name\nof my server to that.\n\n61\n00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.380\nBut I might have more than one web server.\n\n62\n00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.810\nI might have five web servers that\nare all serving up www.ITProTV.com,\n\n63\n00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.060\nbecause I know I might\nget a lot of traffic.\n\n64\n00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.700\nI don't want all my servers\nto have the same name,\n\n65\n00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.790\nthat's going to cause some problems.\n\n66\n00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.750\nWe normally leave that as some kind of\ngeneric name, based on this server.\n\n67\n00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.020\nBut on the site, we go in and\nwe give it an alias, right?\n\n68\n00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.088\nSo when we look at this site here,\nI've got Server Website,\n\n69\n00:03:32.088 --> 00:03:36.510\nit's tied to all my IP addresses,\nit's on Port 80, and I can edit that.\n\n70\n00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.140\nAnd in the definition, you'll start\nto see things like Aliases and\n\n71\n00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.090\nAdditional Domains.\n\n72\n00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.400\nNow Aliases are sub-directories,\nAdditional Domains,\n\n73\n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.450\nthat's the domain name itself.\n\n74\n00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.486\nAnd I'm gonna add one to mine, so\nthat I call it Lab.itpro.tv, all right?\n\n75\n00:03:51.486 --> 00:03:57.450\nSo I'm just going to add that alias in\nhere, so the server is OSX-server01.\n\n76\n00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.630\nAnd I might have server 02,\nserver 03, server 04, but\n\n77\n00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.840\nthey all have an alias of lab.itpro.tv\nthat's shared across them, right?\n\n78\n00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.774\nSo I'm just setting that domain name.\n\n79\n00:04:06.774 --> 00:04:08.340\nNow, understand in order for\n\n80\n00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.585\nthis work I probably need a DNS server\nset up to be able to resolve this.\n\n81\n00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:17.350\nAnd you may or may not host your own DNS\nserver, you might have your registrar\n\n82\n00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.715\nwhere you registered your domain with or\nother servers that are acting as DNS.\n\n83\n00:04:20.715 --> 00:04:24.035\nIn my case, I don't actually\nhave a DNS server set up, so\n\n84\n00:04:24.035 --> 00:04:27.805\nI'll just whip one up real quick, so that\nI can properly resolve that to my own IP.\n\n85\n00:04:28.895 --> 00:04:32.066\nSo, in here I can see that I am\nset up to be a DNS server, well,\n\n86\n00:04:32.066 --> 00:04:34.698\nyou know we had that\nfunctionality in server app.\n\n87\n00:04:34.698 --> 00:04:41.208\nBut I need to add lab.itpro.tv, and add\nmy IP address so it'll come back to me.\n\n88\n00:04:41.208 --> 00:04:44.156\nI'm just 192.168.0.151.\n\n89\n00:04:44.156 --> 00:04:47.850\nYou'll put in the public IP of\nwhatever your server happens to be.\n\n90\n00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.570\nSo I'm gonna punch that in and\nget that created.\n\n91\n00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.520\nAnd I'll turn that thing on, there we go.\n\n92\n00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.740\nAll right, so now I'm up and\nI'm going as a DNS server but I don't know\n\n93\n00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.820\nif I'm actually using myself for DNS so\nlet me just double check that real quick.\n\n94\n00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.696\nIf I go into my system preferences,\nI probably am not.\n\n95\n00:05:03.696 --> 00:05:05.499\nSo I'm going to go into network and\n\n96\n00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:08.731\nI can see that I'm actually using\na different server for DNS,\n\n97\n00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:13.530\nso I need to point that to myself, so\nI'll just real quick override that.\n\n98\n00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.961\nAnd point it to me.\n\n99\n00:05:14.961 --> 00:05:18.720\nAnd what I'm trying to do here,\nyou know, is several different steps.\n\n100\n00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.140\nBut though the main goal here is to\nget myself resolving my own name so\n\n101\n00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.947\nthat I can browse and see this site.\n\n102\n00:05:23.947 --> 00:05:29.750\nSo, let me just apply that and\ntest it to make sure that we're good.\n\n103\n00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.563\nNow, if I go to lab.itpro.tv,\n\n104\n00:05:32.563 --> 00:05:37.396\nit resolves to 192.160.0.151.\n\n105\n00:05:37.396 --> 00:05:43.356\nAnd if I fire up Safari, and\nI browse to lab.itpro.tv,\n\n106\n00:05:43.356 --> 00:05:47.795\nit's pumping me over to the secure page,\nbut then I see right here, right,\n\n107\n00:05:47.795 --> 00:05:51.385\nmy standard OS X Server default webpage,\nright?\n\n108\n00:05:51.385 --> 00:05:55.405\nSo that's the basic web server\nthat we saw in the last episode.\n\n109\n00:05:55.405 --> 00:06:00.715\nBut we can do a lot more than just\nrender up a simple HTML page like this.\n\n110\n00:06:00.715 --> 00:06:06.270\nWhen I go back into the server app and\nI look at my websites and\n\n111\n00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.990\nI come down here and I browse to the site\nbecause that's what I meant to do.\n\n112\n00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.150\nIf I go back here and\nI look at the site itself right so\n\n113\n00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.400\nhere's the site running on\nall IP addresses on port 80.\n\n114\n00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.530\nIf I edit that site, here's what we see.\n\n115\n00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.880\nStore the site files in\na particular directory.\n\n116\n00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.380\nWho's allowed to access.\n\n117\n00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.110\nI got a redirect configured.\n\n118\n00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.870\nWhat's the redirect?\n\n119\n00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.210\nWell, if I edit that,\n\n120\n00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.450\nI can see that's it's actually\nredirecting to the secure Secure page.\n\n121\n00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:32.320\nWe saw that a moment ago.\n\n122\n00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.900\nI'm gonna turn that off.\n\n123\n00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.670\nI don't necessarily want to\nredirect to the secure page.\n\n124\n00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.910\nI'm creating a web application\nthat I want people to access and\n\n125\n00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.200\nthen maybe I don't need SSL.\n\n126\n00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.040\nSo I'm just gonna turn\nthat little redirect off.\n\n127\n00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.790\nRight?\nThose are easy enough to configure.\n\n128\n00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.630\nNot really a big deal.\n\n129\n00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.680\nBut then, if I go to advanced settings\nhere's where we can have some real fun.\n\n130\n00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.730\nWhen I go into my advanced settings,\n\n131\n00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.080\nyou've got a ton of options here you can\nturn on that are all off by default.\n\n132\n00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.540\nLet's run down this list and\ntalk about what each one is.\n\n133\n00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.810\nSome of these are old, support for\nolder technologies you don't want anymore.\n\n134\n00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.220\nSome are stuff that's new that we do want.\n\n135\n00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.660\nThe very first one,\nEnable Server Side Includes.\n\n136\n00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.210\nServer Side Includes back in the day, so,\n\n137\n00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.870\nback when I first started learning\nabout writing web pages and things.\n\n138\n00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.796\nThis would have been around 1993.\n\n139\n00:07:18.796 --> 00:07:19.841\nSo, around 1993,\n\n140\n00:07:19.841 --> 00:07:23.620\nServer Side Includes are one of the\nearliest ways to create web applications.\n\n141\n00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:29.030\nSo, they were files, or really scripts,\nthat would run on the server.\n\n142\n00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.740\nAnd then render output to\nus to be able to view.\n\n143\n00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.430\nAnd it was flexible, it was useful.\n\n144\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.560\nThey had created this technology\nto generate these applications.\n\n145\n00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.720\nBut it was risky.\n\n146\n00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.882\nThere were security concerns to your\nactually running an application\n\n147\n00:07:41.882 --> 00:07:42.582\non the server.\n\n148\n00:07:42.582 --> 00:07:45.521\nNow, when we run that,\nas long as you write it properly,\n\n149\n00:07:45.521 --> 00:07:49.381\nas long as you code it all in there and\nyou put the information in it's safe,\n\n150\n00:07:49.381 --> 00:07:53.519\nbut if you make even one mistake, this is\nthe type of thing that people exploit.\n\n151\n00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:57.420\nAnd we never really wanna have\nan application run on a server that isn't\n\n152\n00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.341\nApproved by us.\n\n153\n00:07:58.341 --> 00:08:01.675\nAnd so server side includes,\nhave largely been replaced.\n\n154\n00:08:01.675 --> 00:08:03.570\nWe really don't see\nthem out there anymore.\n\n155\n00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:04.710\nAnd most people don't use them.\n\n156\n00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.740\nThey're off by default.\n\n157\n00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.560\nI doubt you'll ever have\na need to turn those on,\n\n158\n00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.930\nbecause again they're just kind of\nincreasing your attack surface for a hack.\n\n159\n00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.930\nThe next one,\nallow overrides using htaccess file.\n\n160\n00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:22.160\nAn htaccess file is a hidden file,\nso it's got a dot before it,\n\n161\n00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.120\nand Apache supports having these little\nhidden files in every directory.\n\n162\n00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.240\nAnd you can put operators in\nthere to do all sorts of things.\n\n163\n00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.060\nThey can rewrite your URL, they can\nredirect people to other webpages,\n\n164\n00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.410\nthey can change file names,\nthey can do all sorts of crazy magic.\n\n165\n00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:37.520\nThey're really powerful files.\n\n166\n00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.320\nThey do a lot of stuff.\n\n167\n00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.800\nBut they're not supported by default.\n\n168\n00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.510\nWe have to turn that on.\n\n169\n00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.680\nNow I had a redirect, right?\n\n170\n00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.660\nBack here we could do a redirect\nright in the regular settings,\n\n171\n00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.660\nif I added that we can add in one or\nmore redirects.\n\n172\n00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.760\nBut that's a redirect, that's pulling\nsomebody from one spot to another.\n\n173\n00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.400\nAn HT access file can actually do\na lot more than just redirect.\n\n174\n00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.130\nIt can do things like require\na password to access the page, right?\n\n175\n00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:05.610\nWell, you can actually set\nsome of that stuff with the,\n\n176\n00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.630\nwho can access Settings on these.\n\n177\n00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.390\nSo if I limit it to a particular\nuser it's gonna prompt for\n\n178\n00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.190\na password whenever they access the site.\n\n179\n00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.990\nBut then they have to have a user account.\n\n180\n00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.220\nWith htaccess I could just\nhave a generic password.\n\n181\n00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.620\nYou can define all sorts of\ncrazy things in htaccess.\n\n182\n00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.630\nSo if I wanna do that\nI need to turn it on.\n\n183\n00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:28.730\nNow turning it on isn't gonna make any\nvisible difference for you, like when I\n\n184\n00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:35.260\nturn that support on it's all still going\nto run just the way that it has been.\n\n185\n00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.070\nThere's not really much that's\ngonna be changing here,\n\n186\n00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:42.490\nso once that's turned on it's\nup to me to go and create\n\n187\n00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:47.360\nthe htaccess files to actually go and\ndo whatever it is that I'm trying to do.\n\n188\n00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.550\nNow once that option is turned on we're\nnot really going to notice anything\n\n189\n00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.890\ndifferent right, because well we\ndon't have any ht access files.\n\n190\n00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.690\nWe turned the support on but the files\ndon't exist we have to go and create them.\n\n191\n00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.480\nSo just as a quick example let me\nshow you a basic htaccess file and\n\n192\n00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.050\nwhat we would do.\n\n193\n00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.720\nSo I'm gonna fire up my terminal,\nand I just have the default website.\n\n194\n00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.552\nSo I need to get into the folder for\nthe default website, so\n\n195\n00:10:09.552 --> 00:10:14.385\nI'm just gonna go into\n/Library/Server/Web/Data,\n\n196\n00:10:14.385 --> 00:10:16.567\nsite/default, right?\n\n197\n00:10:16.567 --> 00:10:18.908\nIf this was another website we have\nto go to the name for that one.\n\n198\n00:10:18.908 --> 00:10:22.113\nBut that's the full path to\nget to where the files are.\n\n199\n00:10:22.113 --> 00:10:24.019\nHere I can see like info.php and\n\n200\n00:10:24.019 --> 00:10:28.290\nin those guys that are actually\ngonna load when one of this page.\n\n201\n00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:32.320\nSo, I need to create a page and\nI'm gonna use sudo to do this because you\n\n202\n00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.120\nhave to be in the admin\nto write this directory.\n\n203\n00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:39.300\nSo, I'm gonna create\na file called .htaccess.\n\n204\n00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.340\nAnd the dot at the beginning means\nit's gonna be a hidden file and\n\n205\n00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.480\nthis is going to contain any htaccess\noperatives that I wanna put in here.\n\n206\n00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.660\nSo, I can do things like\nturn on the rewrite engine.\n\n207\n00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.180\nSo I'll turn that option on.\n\n208\n00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.740\nAnd then I can do rewrite rules,\nor redirect, or\n\n209\n00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.710\nwhatever it is that I wanna do.\n\n210\n00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.160\nSo I'm gonna do a redirect.\n\n211\n00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.550\nThere's two types of redirects.\n\n212\n00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.810\nA 302 that's temporary, and\na 301 that's permanent.\n\n213\n00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:02.860\nI'll just do a 302.\n\n214\n00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:10.780\nAnd I'm gonna redirect my entire website,\nso slash to another website, like that.\n\n215\n00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.120\nAnd so now it's gonna redirect, so\n\n216\n00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.670\nanybody visiting the webpage\nis gonna get redirected.\n\n217\n00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.710\nAnd if I look in the directory, if I just\ndo a ls I don't see that access file,\n\n218\n00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.110\nbut if I do a ls -a.\n\n219\n00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.340\nIt shows up right there, .htaccess.\n\n220\n00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:30.050\nNow, every time somebody visits the site,\nit's gonna look for that htaccess file and\n\n221\n00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:31.680\nthen do whatever it says in there.\n\n222\n00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.400\nSo, in my case, it would redirect\nus to another website, right?\n\n223\n00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.960\nNow, I don't actually want that in place,\ncuz I need to show you another example\n\n224\n00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.590\nhere in a minute, so\nI'm gonna get rid of that.\n\n225\n00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:44.750\nHtaccess file there so\nthat we're not doing the redirect.\n\n226\n00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.110\nSo, that's another advanced feature and\n\n227\n00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.810\nthat's one that you pretty\nmuch are guaranteed to use.\n\n228\n00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.700\nIt's very, very common for\npeople to use htaccess files.\n\n229\n00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.500\nSo that's one that you'll see.\n\n230\n00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.180\nService not so much, htaccess yes.\n\n231\n00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.510\nAll right, some of the other ones.\n\n232\n00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:01.940\nFolder listings.\n\n233\n00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.870\nIn the early days of the Internet,\ninstead of FTP servers,\n\n234\n00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.060\nsome people would just throw\nfiles on a web server.\n\n235\n00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.630\nAnd you can browse to a directory and\n\n236\n00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.070\njust see a listing of all\nthe files that were in it.\n\n237\n00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.150\nThese days we don't want that.\n\n238\n00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.010\nWe don't want people just\nbrowsing around on the website so\n\n239\n00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.350\nthat functionality is turned off.\n\n240\n00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:19.261\nBut if you have a folder\nwith a ton of files and\n\n241\n00:12:19.261 --> 00:12:23.274\nyou just want people to see\na listing of all that are in there,\n\n242\n00:12:23.274 --> 00:12:27.939\nas opposed to getting default a webpage,\nyou can turn this option on.\n\n243\n00:12:27.939 --> 00:12:29.474\nThe next one is CGI execution.\n\n244\n00:12:29.474 --> 00:12:32.066\nCGI is common gateway interface,\nand it's designed for\n\n245\n00:12:32.066 --> 00:12:33.637\nserver site executable scripts.\n\n246\n00:12:33.637 --> 00:12:36.136\nIf we wanna run things like Python or\nwhatever,\n\n247\n00:12:36.136 --> 00:12:40.014\nthose are technically scripts and\nexecutables that run from the server.\n\n248\n00:12:40.014 --> 00:12:44.824\nCGI's a gateway that allows users to\ninteract with these programs running on\n\n249\n00:12:44.824 --> 00:12:46.030\nthe server.\n\n250\n00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.515\n>> Now Don you said what\nthe server side includes and\n\n251\n00:12:48.515 --> 00:12:52.390\nbeing bale to run html on your server that\nwas a little bit of a well a lot a bit of\n\n252\n00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.860\na security vulnerability.\n\n253\n00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.837\nIs this gonna be the same thing with\nthe CG, what is it, the CGI [CROSSTALK]?\n\n254\n00:12:56.837 --> 00:12:58.445\nYeah.\n>> It is.\n\n255\n00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:00.420\nIt's really exactly the same.\n\n256\n00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.406\nAnd even PHP can be a little\nrisky from time to time.\n\n257\n00:13:03.406 --> 00:13:08.440\nBut these, more so, because typically,\nthey're compiled scripts, binary files\n\n258\n00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.840\nthat can run, and in theory, if somebody\ncan find a way to modify that file.\n\n259\n00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.750\nThey can now get the server to execute\ncommands on their behalf, which\n\n260\n00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.640\nmeans they'll get elevated privileges and\nthey'll be able to operate as root.\n\n261\n00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.750\nSo you gotta make sure that you take\ncare with any of these applications.\n\n262\n00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.920\nAnywhere there's field input,\n\n263\n00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.430\nyou've gotta make sure that you're\nchecking the data that's being input.\n\n264\n00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.840\nTo make sure people aren't doing\nthings like buffer overflows and\n\n265\n00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.550\nsequel injection attacks, and all those of\nthe types of attacks that is out there.\n\n266\n00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:36.120\nIt's just, stuff here developers\nshould be watching up for already.\n\n267\n00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.500\nAll right, the last option is to\nuse a custom error page, right?\n\n268\n00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.840\nSo, I can turn this option to\nget different error pages.\n\n269\n00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:47.790\nThe default is, if I command and provide\na URL that doesn't point anywhere, right?\n\n270\n00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:54.090\nSo, if I go to Safari and\nI browse to lab.itpro.tv/ test, okay?\n\n271\n00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:58.110\nWell test doesn't exist, and\nso I get this Not Found.\n\n272\n00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.560\nBut a lot of times you guys have\nprobably seen where you get a 404\n\n273\n00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.180\nPage Not Found, right?\n\n274\n00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.400\nThis is a 404 error.\n\n275\n00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.400\nBut this is just the generic\nlittle error that I get.\n\n276\n00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.410\nYou might want to have a custom error page\nthat looks all pretty, that has your logo,\n\n277\n00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.100\nor what is it, Twitter that has\nthe fail whale that appears?\n\n278\n00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.210\nYou might have a mascot for your failures.\n\n279\n00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.290\nAnd if that's the case you'll need\nto override these error pages, and\n\n280\n00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.280\nthat's what this last option is all about.\n\n281\n00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.440\nUse custom error page and you can specify.\n\n282\n00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.840\nNow the only one that they\nprovide support for, right here.\n\n283\n00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.360\nIs, well really just a single page, right?\n\n284\n00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.950\nThey show 500.\nThat would be an application failure, but\n\n285\n00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.320\nyou can do 404 for page not found,\nbut there's quite a few.\n\n286\n00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.760\nThere's 403 errors, 500s, 404s.\n\n287\n00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.310\nIf you wanna override more than one,\nyou can't do it.\n\n288\n00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.480\nYou can only override one from here.\n\n289\n00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.160\nIf you wanna override more than one,\nyou'll need to use an htaccess file.\n\n290\n00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.090\nHtaccess can let you override\nevery single error page you want,\n\n291\n00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:49.990\nand you can put it all in there.\n\n292\n00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.769\nSo, you may have to use a mixture of\nthese options to achieve what you want.\n\n293\n00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.430\nNow the last thing that I want to\ntalk about on the advanced side\n\n294\n00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.060\nare these python applications.\n\n295\n00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:02.100\nThese are web applications that can\nbe stored inside of the web server.\n\n296\n00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.840\nThey're programs that can run and generate\nweb content that's unviewable to users.\n\n297\n00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.835\nYou can do very,\nvery powerful things here.\n\n298\n00:15:07.835 --> 00:15:10.865\nThere's a lot of web services\nused that work this way.\n\n299\n00:15:10.865 --> 00:15:12.215\nThings like Facebook.\n\n300\n00:15:13.425 --> 00:15:15.445\nEven Ebay, even Amazon.\n\n301\n00:15:15.445 --> 00:15:16.685\nWhen you go to their web pages,\n\n302\n00:15:16.685 --> 00:15:20.285\nthey're not just simple HTML pages,\nthey're full blown applications.\n\n303\n00:15:20.285 --> 00:15:22.975\nIf you use any web based\nemail you deal with this.\n\n304\n00:15:22.975 --> 00:15:23.605\nLike Gmail.\n\n305\n00:15:23.605 --> 00:15:25.705\nThe Gmail interface is very,\nvery powerful.\n\n306\n00:15:25.705 --> 00:15:28.130\nIt's go pop up chat, it's got all\nsorts of crazy things built into it.\n\n307\n00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.750\nThose are web applications and\n\n308\n00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.160\nthey need far more than just\na handful of HTML files.\n\n309\n00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.710\nThey're very complex.\n\n310\n00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:38.170\nSo we can register Python\napplications with our web server and\n\n311\n00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.490\nhave them up and running.\n\n312\n00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.205\nThe thing is,\nit's actually kind of difficult.\n\n313\n00:15:41.205 --> 00:15:44.881\nIt looks easy, like hey I've got\nthis Hello World app right here.\n\n314\n00:15:44.881 --> 00:15:47.279\nI just check the box and\nI've got Hello World.\n\n315\n00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:48.574\nThat was easy, right?\n\n316\n00:15:48.574 --> 00:15:51.985\nAnd on the exam, that's probably the limit\nof what they want you to know, but\n\n317\n00:15:51.985 --> 00:15:55.606\nyou take the exam, you pass it, you're\ncertified, you go out in the real world,\n\n318\n00:15:55.606 --> 00:16:00.160\nand somebody says, hey okay, here's our\nPython app, can you get that registered?\n\n319\n00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.630\nWell it's actually really hard, because it\ndoesn't show up here on the list, right.\n\n320\n00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.670\nYou can't check it.\n\n321\n00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:05.970\nHow am I supposed to do that?\n\n322\n00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.500\nWell there is actually a whole process we\nhave to go through to get an application\n\n323\n00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.660\nloaded in the server.\n\n324\n00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.420\nAnd there's a reason for that.\n\n325\n00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:16.810\nI know Apple usually makes things easy,\nthis is not easy, and the reason is\n\n326\n00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:20.440\nyou cause a lot of damage with this, you\ncan expose yourself to a lot of risk and\n\n327\n00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.270\nso Apple wants to make sure\nthat you are doubly and\n\n328\n00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:25.470\ntriply sure that you want that be there,\nso we have several steps,\n\n329\n00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.490\nwe have to go through to get\nthe application in place.\n\n330\n00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:32.890\nSo as an example,\nlet me go to my desktop here.\n\n331\n00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:36.110\nI uploaded before the show, so that you\nguys wouldn't have to watch me type.\n\n332\n00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:40.624\nI created a little example script, and I'm\njust gonna open this with a text editor or\n\n333\n00:16:40.624 --> 00:16:41.335\nsomething.\n\n334\n00:16:42.799 --> 00:16:47.391\nAnd I'll show you guys this simple\nscript here, and what this is,\n\n335\n00:16:47.391 --> 00:16:51.180\nis a very simple Python application,\nall right.\n\n336\n00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.790\nAnd what it's doing is generating a web\npage, much like PHP does, where PHP will\n\n337\n00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:59.470\ngenerate a web page and you end up getting\nan HTML when the application runs.\n\n338\n00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:03.260\nAnd so what this one is doing,\nis it's checking my server status and\n\n339\n00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:09.060\nthen it's generating a page that says,\nthis text is rendered using Python.\n\n340\n00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.390\nJust like we saw in the last episode,\nthis text was rendered using PHP or HTML,\n\n341\n00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.390\nthis would be rendered using Python.\n\n342\n00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:17.530\nAnd then Python is generating that as\na response header, and then outputs,\n\n343\n00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.330\nand then we end up with a web page.\n\n344\n00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.050\nSo I'm constructing a page through Python.\n\n345\n00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:24.390\nVery, very simple example here.\n\n346\n00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:29.230\nSo I've got the application and\nwhat do I do with it?\n\n347\n00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.240\nWell there's two things.\n\n348\n00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.470\nOne is the application itself.\n\n349\n00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:32.890\nSomebody's got to write that.\n\n350\n00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.710\nSo that's gonna be this wsgi file.\n\n351\n00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.040\nThat's the application itself.\n\n352\n00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.180\nI need a copy added in my web server.\n\n353\n00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.920\nAnd then I need to register it\nwith the server by creating\n\n354\n00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.220\na preference file for it.\n\n355\n00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.260\nAnd I've created a preference\nfile ahead of time.\n\n356\n00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:52.747\nSo I've got this tv.itpro.example, because\nthe web page might be example .itpro.tv.\n\n357\n00:17:52.747 --> 00:17:57.110\nI did lab.itpro.tv, so\nI might actually need to rename that.\n\n358\n00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:00.870\nBut that would be the example\nkind of file that I'm using.\n\n359\n00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:05.070\nAnd then underneath that\nI've got wsgi.plist, right.\n\n360\n00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.110\nIt's a preference file.\n\n361\n00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.560\nAnd if I open that one and\ntake a look at it,\n\n362\n00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.350\nwell you'll see there's not\na whole heck of alot in here.\n\n363\n00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.150\nI give it a name,right.\n\n364\n00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:17.280\nSo here's the string name for the file and\nthen the name of the application.\n\n365\n00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.205\nI called it,\nExample Python app at /example.\n\n366\n00:18:21.205 --> 00:18:24.245\nEvery Python app is going to\nbe attached to an A list.\n\n367\n00:18:24.245 --> 00:18:25.945\nAnd the A list will be a subdirectory.\n\n368\n00:18:25.945 --> 00:18:28.785\nSo I'm creating a subdirectory\ncalled /example, and\n\n369\n00:18:28.785 --> 00:18:30.425\nthat's where this app is going to live.\n\n370\n00:18:30.425 --> 00:18:32.785\nIt doesn't matter that my domain\nname doesn't quite match,\n\n371\n00:18:32.785 --> 00:18:34.310\nas long as that directory name does.\n\n372\n00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.690\nSo I'm gonna have /example.\n\n373\n00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.100\nThe example that Apple\nbuilds in is in /wsgi.\n\n374\n00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.210\nThat's where you browse to get that one.\n\n375\n00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.730\nAnd then I tell it where the file\nis gonna reside, and so you'll see,\n\n376\n00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.210\nit's put in that web apps folder.\n\n377\n00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.550\nI'm gonna have to copy that\nover to get it in place.\n\n378\n00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:52.870\nAnd then after that, it ties it in\ninto Apache's global configuration.\n\n379\n00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.680\nThis preference file is pretty\nimportant it's what's actually tying\n\n380\n00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.860\neverything together.\n\n381\n00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.680\nAnd I'll put a copy of this\nfile in the show notes.\n\n382\n00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.370\nSo don't worry about jotting this down\nif you're trying to get it in a hurry.\n\n383\n00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.514\nIt's all a part of the show notes.\n\n384\n00:19:03.855 --> 00:19:06.115\nAll right.\nSo to get this all setup and working,\n\n385\n00:19:06.115 --> 00:19:09.925\nI'm gonna have to drop to my terminal and\nget serious for a minute here.\n\n386\n00:19:09.925 --> 00:19:14.075\nRight, so right now I'm in my\ndefault site directory and\n\n387\n00:19:14.075 --> 00:19:20.848\nthat's not exactly where I need to be,\nif you browse around inside of the web\n\n388\n00:19:20.848 --> 00:19:25.950\nserver's folder,\nthe directory where everything is stored.\n\n389\n00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:30.250\nSo /library/server/web/data, you'll see\nthere's actually two folders in there,\n\n390\n00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.050\none called sites.\n\n391\n00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.580\nAnd that's where I've been going,\nthat's where the websites actually are.\n\n392\n00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.650\nBut then there's another\nfolder called WebApps.\n\n393\n00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.290\nAnd that's where your web\napplications are supposed to live.\n\n394\n00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:42.060\nApple puts them into a separate folder\n\n395\n00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.380\nbecause it wants to manage\npermissions differently.\n\n396\n00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.710\nYou don't want some external user\ncoming and modifying these files.\n\n397\n00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.510\nIt wants to manage them separately, so\nit puts them into a separate directory.\n\n398\n00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.880\nAnd I can see hello.wsgi.\n\n399\n00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.130\nThat's the example from Apple.\n\n400\n00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.650\nThat's the one that they\npackage with the system.\n\n401\n00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.740\nNow, if I look at the permissions on that,\n\n402\n00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:04.110\nnotice how it's owned by root and\nthe group is set to wheel.\n\n403\n00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:08.890\nThat's a little different than our\nwebpages from earlier, where they were in,\n\n404\n00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:12.180\nhere let me just pull that up.\n\n405\n00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.910\nWhere these were owned by root and\nthe group was admin.\n\n406\n00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.210\nAll right, so what's going on there?\n\n407\n00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:22.290\nWell admin, that is the group\nthat is the OS X administrator.\n\n408\n00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:28.010\nBut wheel, those are superusers in BSD,\nin the UNIX under the hood level.\n\n409\n00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:31.140\nSo this is like a higher\nlevel of administrator.\n\n410\n00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.170\nAnd so\nthis is where our risks starts to come in.\n\n411\n00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:39.530\nThat these are scripted executables that\ncan run as full blown administrators.\n\n412\n00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.490\nAnd so that's why we've gotta be\ncareful with how these are written and\n\n413\n00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:45.240\nwith the risk we create,\nwhen we expose applications like these.\n\n414\n00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.910\nAll right, so I need to copy my\napplication into this folder.\n\n415\n00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:54.960\nSo I have mine tucked away right here.\n\n416\n00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:00.320\nSo I'm just gonna copy that file in here\nand when I look at it, I gotta be careful,\n\n417\n00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.870\ncuz see who it's owned by?\n\n418\n00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:05.490\nRight, it's owned by me, and with the\nadmin group, it's not owned by root and\n\n419\n00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.150\nwheel like it needs to be.\n\n420\n00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.870\nSo I've got to fix the permissions on this\nfile, permissions are really important, so\n\n421\n00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.290\nI'll have to change that right here.\n\n422\n00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:15.640\n>> And Don I can only imagine that\nwe don't get a nice gooey for\n\n423\n00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.130\nthis one, so\nare we gonna be dropping down to some\n\n424\n00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.685\nof the traditional unit base permissions\n>> Yes,\n\n425\n00:21:21.685 --> 00:21:23.323\nthis is straight up positix, right.\n\n426\n00:21:23.323 --> 00:21:26.021\nSo this is unix subsystem\nthat we gotta do, so\n\n427\n00:21:26.021 --> 00:21:30.000\nI'm gonna have to use the CHMOD\ncommand and the CHOWN command.\n\n428\n00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.190\nCHMOD for modifying the permissions and\nCHOWN for changing the ownership.\n\n429\n00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.040\nAnd I'm gonna have to sudo all this,\ncuz I can't do it as myself,\n\n430\n00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.870\nI'm just a regular Joe Schmoe user.\n\n431\n00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:41.800\nSo I'm gonna start by\nchanging the permissions,\n\n432\n00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.500\ncuz if you look minor read and\nwrite with no execute.\n\n433\n00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.150\nSo I need to give execute permissions\non here it's not gonna work out, so\n\n434\n00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:51.310\nwell, so I'll go ahead and do that.\n\n435\n00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:55.790\nAnd let me authenticate, and\nthen I need to change the owner also.\n\n436\n00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:57.450\nSo I'm gonna use the chown or\n\n437\n00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:01.220\nchange owner command,\nto make it owned by root and wheel.\n\n438\n00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.390\nAnd if you forget it's easy to\nremember because you can just look at\n\n439\n00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:10.220\nhello dot apple package, and\nyours should end up just looking the same.\n\n440\n00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.190\nSo there's mine and they look the same.\n\n441\n00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:13.300\nWell they sort of look the same,\n\n442\n00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.990\nI actually have a little problem\nI'm gonna add symbol on mine.\n\n443\n00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:18.600\nThat means I get some kind of\nextended metadata on this.\n\n444\n00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.760\nIt's probably not a big deal.\n\n445\n00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.430\nLet me just add on mine,\nso you can see what it is.\n\n446\n00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.260\nAnd it's text encoding,\n\n447\n00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.490\ncuz I opened it in TextEdit,\nTextEdit created a little extra metadata.\n\n448\n00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.670\nIf I opened this other file in TextEdit,\nI'd end up with the same thing, so\n\n449\n00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:32.210\nI can ignore that.\n\n450\n00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:37.270\nAll right, so now though,\nI do have two files, they're both here,\n\n451\n00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:41.390\nthey got the same permissions, they got\nthe same ownerships, so now I'm kinda set.\n\n452\n00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:45.300\nExcept the server doesn't know where\nto make this application available.\n\n453\n00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.630\nIt doesn't know what directory to mount it\nto, so I've gotta add a preference file.\n\n454\n00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:53.030\nIf I were to go back to my server app and\nedit my website.\n\n455\n00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:57.920\nAnd going to advanced,\nI will see my application, right.\n\n456\n00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.930\nAnd it is because the preference\nfile is still missing, so\n\n457\n00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:03.818\nI need to put that in place before\nit really get some privacy.\n\n458\n00:23:03.818 --> 00:23:06.020\nAlright, so that's gonna be my next step.\n\n459\n00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.640\nNow the preference file actually goes into\na different location into a different\n\n460\n00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.730\nfolder, so I am gonna copy that and\n\n461\n00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.950\nlet me get to that folder first\nto make life easier for me.\n\n462\n00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:18.950\nSo I'm gonna /Libraries/Server/Web/Config.\n\n463\n00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:24.210\nAnd then in there you got an apache2 for.\n\n464\n00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.860\nThe web server is actually Apache,\nApache version two.\n\n465\n00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.400\nSo even though it shows\nas like being the OS X\n\n466\n00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.310\nserver app web server is\nactually just Apache.\n\n467\n00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:36.620\nAnd inside of there, you'll see Apache\nas a ton of configuration files.\n\n468\n00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.410\nJust all sorts of stuff in here.\n\n469\n00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:42.620\nAnd inside of here there's\na folder called webapps.\n\n470\n00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.925\nAnd that's where we register our webapps.\n\n471\n00:23:44.925 --> 00:23:48.048\nSo unless it's in here,\nApache doesn't know about it.\n\n472\n00:23:48.048 --> 00:23:51.079\nAnd if Apache doesn't know about it, then\nthe server app doesn't know about it and\n\n473\n00:23:51.079 --> 00:23:52.173\nthat's why we don't see it.\n\n474\n00:23:52.173 --> 00:23:54.719\nSo I need to send that plist file in here.\n\n475\n00:23:54.719 --> 00:23:58.406\nAnd notice here's this\ncom.example.mywebapp.plist,\n\n476\n00:23:58.406 --> 00:24:03.400\nthat's the example from Apple, that's\ntheir Hello example that they've got.\n\n477\n00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.350\nI'm gonna copy my own in.\n\n478\n00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:09.369\nSo I'm gonna copy,\nactually I gotta sudo this one also.\n\n479\n00:24:09.369 --> 00:24:13.237\nSo from my little desktop example file,\n\n480\n00:24:13.237 --> 00:24:18.829\nI need to get that file,\ncopy right into here, all right.\n\n481\n00:24:18.829 --> 00:24:21.630\nAnd, command not found?\n\n482\n00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:22.914\nDid I typed copy wrong?\n\n483\n00:24:22.914 --> 00:24:24.321\nI never actually typed copy.\n\n484\n00:24:24.321 --> 00:24:27.145\nSo I need to do cp to copy.\n\n485\n00:24:27.145 --> 00:24:28.420\nThat will help.\n\n486\n00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.365\nAll right, so now when I take a look,\nthere's my little ITProTV plist file,\n\n487\n00:24:32.365 --> 00:24:33.850\nsitting right there.\n\n488\n00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:35.520\nIt's owned by root and wheel.\n\n489\n00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.680\nIt's got the right permission, so I don't\neven have to mock about with ownership or\n\n490\n00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.580\npermission of this one.\n\n491\n00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:43.670\nIt's set the way that I need it to be, and\nso I'm in good shape there, all right.\n\n492\n00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:46.930\nSo at this point,\nnow Apache knows what to look at.\n\n493\n00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:49.160\nIt knows that this app should exist.\n\n494\n00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.340\nBut I need to restart Apache for\nit to recognize it.\n\n495\n00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.568\nSo I'll do it from\nthe command line this time.\n\n496\n00:24:54.568 --> 00:24:56.850\nI could go back to the UI and\nstop it and start it.\n\n497\n00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:02.050\nBut from the command line,\nyou can just use sudo apachectl restart.\n\n498\n00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.590\nAnd when you issue that, that's gonna\nrestart Apache in the background.\n\n499\n00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:11.410\nThat's the same as if I came to the GUI,\nwent to websites, and\n\n500\n00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:16.830\nflipped it off, waited a second, and then\nflipped it on again, same basic thing.\n\n501\n00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:19.730\nNow I will tell you this,\neven stopping and starting the service\n\n502\n00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:23.900\nfrom here does not cause the server\napp to refresh the interface.\n\n503\n00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.630\nAnd so you might not see your application\neven though we've done that restart.\n\n504\n00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:31.200\nSo I've kind of gotten in the habit\nof closing the server manager and\n\n505\n00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.210\nopening it again just\nto be on the safe side.\n\n506\n00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.460\nThat's the way you guarantee\nyou get a full refresh.\n\n507\n00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.500\n>> Now, Don, you've taken us\nthrough quite a few steps here.\n\n508\n00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:43.410\nHow can we verify that all of\nthose steps worked for us?\n\n509\n00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:46.920\n>> But wait, we can't quite verify it yet,\ncuz we haven't actually turned it on.\n\n510\n00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.870\nAnd we could see that in the list,\nthat it's registered properly, right.\n\n511\n00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:52.200\nBut we gotta go and\nturn it on before it will actually work.\n\n512\n00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.400\nEven Apple's example is\nturned off by default.\n\n513\n00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.830\nSo, let's do that.\n\n514\n00:25:55.830 --> 00:26:00.110\nIf I jump back into my server app, and\nI go to my default website here and\n\n515\n00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:03.310\nI edit it,\nI'll go into my advanced settings, and\n\n516\n00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:06.230\nnow I can see,\nthere's the Python app from Apple.\n\n517\n00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:08.810\nThere's my Python app that's\nnow registered properly.\n\n518\n00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:12.300\nSo I know it's registered properly, but\nI don't know if it's actually working.\n\n519\n00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.230\nSo I can go and I'll turn them both on.\n\n520\n00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:15.570\nSo we'll turn them both on.\n\n521\n00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.580\nNotice how mine's gonna\nbe mounted at /example.\n\n522\n00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.274\nTheirs is mounted is at /wsgi.\n\n523\n00:26:19.274 --> 00:26:21.213\nSo, we'll be able to test both.\n\n524\n00:26:21.213 --> 00:26:22.850\nSo we're going to set that.\n\n525\n00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.485\nAnd then I'm gonna fire up Safari and\n\n526\n00:26:24.485 --> 00:26:26.555\nnow we can just test to see if it works,\nright.\n\n527\n00:26:26.555 --> 00:26:30.830\nSo if I go to lab.itpro.tv4/wsgi,\n\n528\n00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:34.850\nthat should take me to Apple's app.\n\n529\n00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:37.860\nAnd sure enough,\nthis text is displayed by a Python script,\n\n530\n00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:41.950\nexecuted via the webapp.plist(8)\nmechanism, blah, blah, blah, right.\n\n531\n00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.870\nSo I know the Python subsystem is working,\nthe app comes up.\n\n532\n00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:53.260\nBut if I fire mine up, so I'll do\n/example, right, I get 404 not found.\n\n533\n00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.510\nAll right, so I screwed something up.\n\n534\n00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.660\nWell, let's run through what I did.\n\n535\n00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:01.050\nI copied the actual application\ninto the web apps folder and\n\n536\n00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.480\nthen we created the plist\nfile that registered it.\n\n537\n00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.640\nAnd normally, I'd say time to check for\nsome typos, but\n\n538\n00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.710\nthis time I copied the files so I know\nthere's no typo in there, they're right.\n\n539\n00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:15.310\nSo I must have missed a step, and\nI can kind of think of it already here.\n\n540\n00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:20.356\nWhen we mounted to this, that is an alias,\nright, /example is an alias.\n\n541\n00:27:20.356 --> 00:27:25.488\nAnd I pointed out earlier how even\nthough we've got these guys /wsgi and\n\n542\n00:27:25.488 --> 00:27:29.613\n/example, that if I go back\ninto my Advanced Settings and\n\n543\n00:27:29.613 --> 00:27:34.010\nI look at aliases,\nthere's no aliases configured, right.\n\n544\n00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:36.031\nIf I edit that,\nthere's no folders that are mapped.\n\n545\n00:27:36.031 --> 00:27:38.644\nSo how does it actually know\nthat those aliases exist?\n\n546\n00:27:38.644 --> 00:27:43.296\nAnd the answer is Python applications\ndon't have an alias listed here, but\n\n547\n00:27:43.296 --> 00:27:48.110\nthey do have an alias registered in the\nbackground and I forgot to register it.\n\n548\n00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:49.980\nSo that's the third step that I missed.\n\n549\n00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.150\nYou gotta copy your application\nto the web app folder.\n\n550\n00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.850\nYou gotta create the plist\nfile to register it.\n\n551\n00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:58.090\nAnd then you've got to add the alias,\nand I have not done that.\n\n552\n00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:01.560\nSo let me fire up my terminal and\nwe will fix that.\n\n553\n00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.612\nAnd the way this works\nis the alias is actually\n\n554\n00:28:04.612 --> 00:28:07.755\nstored in the configuration file for\nApache.\n\n555\n00:28:07.755 --> 00:28:15.475\nSo I need to get back into\n/Library/Server,/Web/Config/apache2.\n\n556\n00:28:15.475 --> 00:28:17.556\nSo I'm gonna get all the way back there,\nand\n\n557\n00:28:17.556 --> 00:28:20.520\nthat's where we saw all\nthose various Apache files.\n\n558\n00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:27.580\nAnd the one I'm looking for\nin here is called httpd_wsgi.conf, right.\n\n559\n00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.330\nThat's the configuration file for\nall of the registered Python apps.\n\n560\n00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:36.690\nAnd so I'm gonna edit that file and\n\n561\n00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:40.560\ninside of it, I have to do a sudo,\ncuz you gotta be an administrator.\n\n562\n00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:45.780\nBut inside of it, I can see right here the\nalias for Apple, right, for their example.\n\n563\n00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:48.690\nAnd I just need to add to this, mine.\n\n564\n00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:53.490\nSo I'm just gonna come in here and\nsay, WSGIScriptAlias,\n\n565\n00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.260\nwhich if I spell right will\nwork a little bit better.\n\n566\n00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:01.903\nAnd I'm gonna mount mine to /example,\ninstead of /wsgi like they're doing.\n\n567\n00:29:01.903 --> 00:29:07.868\nAnd it'll be\n/Library/Server/Web/Data/WebApps/,\n\n568\n00:29:07.868 --> 00:29:12.689\nand then mine was called example.wsgi,\nright.\n\n569\n00:29:12.689 --> 00:29:15.443\nThat's how it's gonna know\nabout that subdirectory.\n\n570\n00:29:15.443 --> 00:29:18.752\nThat's how it'll know about that\nmapping and it'll put it in place.\n\n571\n00:29:18.752 --> 00:29:20.772\nLet me just save that.\n\n572\n00:29:20.772 --> 00:29:23.765\nAnd so now that I've got the alias\nin there, I'm good to go,\n\n573\n00:29:23.765 --> 00:29:26.010\nbut I do need to restart\nthe web server again.\n\n574\n00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:33.110\nSo I'm gonna restart it just one more time\nwith a little sudo apachectl restart.\n\n575\n00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:39.820\nAnd now my web application's registered,\nit's turned on, and the alias is there.\n\n576\n00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:42.316\nSo hopefully it'll work this time,\nhopefully.\n\n577\n00:29:42.316 --> 00:29:46.070\nSo [LAUGH] so I'll fire up Safari again.\n\n578\n00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:47.570\nI'm gonna pull up Apple's example.\n\n579\n00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.810\nAll right, and now I'm gonna try and\npull up my example.\n\n580\n00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.980\nAnd, it still didn't load.\n\n581\n00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.070\nSo why didn't it load?\n\n582\n00:29:57.070 --> 00:30:03.340\nWell, I restarted Apache, but it may\nnot have recognized that taking affect.\n\n583\n00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.420\nSo I'm just gonna do one more thing.\n\n584\n00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:11.470\nI'm gonna go into the server app and make\nsure that I actually did turn that app on.\n\n585\n00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:12.550\nSo it is on.\n\n586\n00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.790\nAnd then I 'm just gonna flip\nthe old power switch here and\n\n587\n00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:19.640\ngive it just a second to stop and then\nI'll flip it and turn it back on again.\n\n588\n00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.500\nJust one more quick restart\nto make sure it gets that.\n\n589\n00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.486\nThe other thing is my web browser\nmight be causing the problem, so\n\n590\n00:30:23.486 --> 00:30:24.796\nI'm gonna close Safari and open it again.\n\n591\n00:30:24.796 --> 00:30:29.474\nBut assuming that it does,\nthen it should work and we should be in.\n\n592\n00:30:29.474 --> 00:30:30.973\nAll right, so that's started.\n\n593\n00:30:30.973 --> 00:30:37.136\nI'm gonna get out of Safari and\nrelaunch Safari, and we'll try and\n\n594\n00:30:37.136 --> 00:30:42.665\nbrowse that one more time,\nso live.itpro.tv/example.\n\n595\n00:30:42.665 --> 00:30:44.347\nThere we go, now it's working for us.\n\n596\n00:30:44.347 --> 00:30:48.350\nSo I can see this text is\nrendered using Python, right.\n\n597\n00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:50.490\nSo my Python app is now firing.\n\n598\n00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:51.920\nIt was a lot of steps to go through,\nright.\n\n599\n00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.290\nI had to copy the app\nto the web apps folder.\n\n600\n00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:57.970\nI had to register it with a plist file,\nand then I had to create the alias for\n\n601\n00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:58.500\nthe subfolder.\n\n602\n00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.800\nBut once all that was done,\n\n603\n00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.460\nnow I've got a valid web\napplication that's up and running.\n\n604\n00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.590\nAnd I can actually use it on\nmore than one site if I want.\n\n605\n00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:09.170\nBecause if I've got a secure version of\nthe site, I'll actually need to go into\n\n606\n00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:12.780\nthe server manager, and\nedit the secure version of the site, and\n\n607\n00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.940\ngo into Advanced Settings and\nturn it on there, too, right.\n\n608\n00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:19.050\nSo I've gotta enable those applications\nto be able to run on the site.\n\n609\n00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:23.200\nSo you may need to reuse that in more than\none place or it could just be tied here.\n\n610\n00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.650\nBut now you've got a lot more power,\nbut without a GUI to manage it.\n\n611\n00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:29.040\n>> Don, thanks for that information.\n\n612\n00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.360\nA lot of great information here and\nadvance configurations as well.\n\n613\n00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.190\nNow, I do see that we're creeping\nup on the end of another episode.\n\n614\n00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:38.990\nBefore we do though,\ndo you have any additional information?\n\n615\n00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:40.030\n>> That's really about it.\n\n616\n00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.250\nJust be careful with these things.\n\n617\n00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:44.858\nAnd you'll find that if you have\na really complex web application,\n\n618\n00:31:44.858 --> 00:31:48.560\nthe server app and Apple subsystems\njust may not be able to handle it.\n\n619\n00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.810\nSo don't hesitate to install full-blown\nApache on your system if you need it.\n\n620\n00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:56.220\nYou can use the Brew app to install that\nreally quickly and get it up and running,\n\n621\n00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.720\nespecially if you need advanced\nthings like a MySQL database.\n\n622\n00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.910\nThat can work out a lot\nbetter in many scenarios.\n\n623\n00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:03.450\nSo don't hesitate to do that.\n\n624\n00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:04.530\nThis web server's great.\n\n625\n00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:07.580\nIt works fine, but\nthe more complex your configuration,\n\n626\n00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.430\nthe more difficult it becomes to support,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n627\n00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:11.580\n>> Well, Don, we thank you for that.\n\n628\n00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.600\nAnd we thank you,\nthe viewer out there, for watching.\n\n629\n00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.160\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off here at ITProTV.\n\n630\n00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.680\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n631\n00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.721\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n632\n00:32:19.721 --> 00:32:28.080\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.300\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.930\nAnd in today's episode we're moving\nthrough our OS10 Server Essentials.\n\n5\n00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.780\nNow through the last couple of episodes,\n\n6\n00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.060\nwe've really been focusing\non network services.\n\n7\n00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.760\nWell, it's gonna change\nup a little bit today and\n\n8\n00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.350\nwe're gonna be talking about\ncollaborative services and Wiki websites.\n\n9\n00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.530\nAnd joining us in the studios to help us\nwith that very endeavor is none other than\n\n10\n00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.360\nMr Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.680\nDon, how you doing today, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.610\n>> I'm doing great, Wes,\nready to jump into our new section.\n\n13\n00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.030\nAnd when we call it a new section,\n\n14\n00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.920\nreally all these collaborative\nservices are network services.\n\n15\n00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.960\nBut they're network services\nthat have a common goal.\n\n16\n00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.550\nAnd that goal is to help\npeople talk to each other.\n\n17\n00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.960\nSo, I know, you could just go and talk\nto somebody but God forbid we did that.\n\n18\n00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.495\nSo instead, we've got a number of\ndifferent different services here that we\n\n19\n00:00:53.495 --> 00:00:57.375\ncan use to collaborate things like\nthe email server and the wiki server.\n\n20\n00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:01.445\nNow wiki is one of those things that\n10 years ago nobody cared about and\n\n21\n00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:02.345\nit seemed like a dumb idea.\n\n22\n00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:06.160\nBut today people use wiki\ntype services all the time.\n\n23\n00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.960\nIf you're not familiar what wikis, well,\n\n24\n00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.220\nyou probably heard of Wikipedia which is\none of them biggest examples of this.\n\n25\n00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.450\nAll a wiki is is a webpage.\n\n26\n00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.250\nBut unlike a normal webpage that\nhas content that you can just view,\n\n27\n00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.830\na wiki can be edited and changed.\n\n28\n00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.090\nAnd so you can use it just like a central\nnotice board of sorts, where people can\n\n29\n00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.120\npost information and edit and change\nthe data to keep it lively and relevant.\n\n30\n00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.760\nA lot of companies use these internally\nfor employees to do knowledge transfer,\n\n31\n00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.150\nto exchange information.\n\n32\n00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.800\nSo they're powerful from that respect.\n\n33\n00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.080\nBut you can also have it where\nyour customers make use of it to\n\n34\n00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.680\nhelp flesh out the documentation for\nyour product, or whatever.\n\n35\n00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.000\nWhich is, one of the, I guess,\nsadder uses of wikis.\n\n36\n00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.270\nBut it is a neat function and\n\n37\n00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.860\nwe do have a wiki server built\nright into the server app in OS X.\n\n38\n00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.490\nNow, it is turned off by default and it\nis built on top of the website's service.\n\n39\n00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.380\nSo, it's very similar to what we\ncovered in the website service.\n\n40\n00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.500\nBut when we talk about websites, that\nwas simply us making pages available for\n\n41\n00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.860\nviewing by other users.\n\n42\n00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.240\nWe weren't letting users\nedit the site at all.\n\n43\n00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.560\nWith the wiki, we do allow them to edit\nand we don't require third party software\n\n44\n00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.260\nfor it or anything like that, they can\nedit it right from their web browser.\n\n45\n00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.390\nIt's actually using web distributed\nauthoring versioning here, WEBDAV,\n\n46\n00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.130\nto be able to provide that functionality.\n\n47\n00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.390\nAnd it's entirely web based which\nmeans you don't have software you\n\n48\n00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.520\nhave to use to support it.\n\n49\n00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.012\nPeople can be on a Linux box, Windows,\nMac, whatever, and they can edit the Wiki,\n\n50\n00:02:29.012 --> 00:02:31.758\naccess the information and\ndo whatever they need.\n\n51\n00:02:31.758 --> 00:02:34.350\nLet's take a look at the service.\n\n52\n00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.920\nThis is one of those services that's\nreally simple to get fired up.\n\n53\n00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.040\nIf you go into your server app and\nlook down the left side,\n\n54\n00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.590\nyou've got websites which you don't\nnecessarily have to have turned on.\n\n55\n00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.130\nI've got mine turned on already.\n\n56\n00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.400\nWhen you turn on wiki, it's gonna turn\non the website functionality anyway.\n\n57\n00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.140\nSo they kind of go hand in hand.\n\n58\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.130\nBut when you go to the wiki service,\n\n59\n00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.150\nthere's not a whole lot\nwe can customize on it.\n\n60\n00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.030\nYou can edit permissions as far\nas who's allowed to use it.\n\n61\n00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.120\nSo that's kind of a nice thing.\n\n62\n00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.320\nYou might not want everybody\nto be able to access it.\n\n63\n00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.835\nAnd then after that enable\nWebDAV access to Wiki files.\n\n64\n00:03:06.835 --> 00:03:09.680\nYou can actually use the Wikis and\n\n65\n00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.120\nedit the content without\nhaving WebDAV turned on.\n\n66\n00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.200\nBut if you have it turned on,\nyou can use third party software and\n\n67\n00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.160\nactually melt the files, and\n\n68\n00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.790\nif you need to make bulk changes\nthat becomes a lot more convenient.\n\n69\n00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.050\nSo you've got the ability to turn\nthat on or off, that's up to you.\n\n70\n00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.190\nBut otherwise, there's not really\nmuch that we need to tweak.\n\n71\n00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.700\nNotice here,\n\n72\n00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.420\nit says that if we have WebDAV turned on,\nIOS users can edit the files using iWork.\n\n73\n00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.610\nThey can actually fire up the iWork app,\nwhich is kinda being replaced right now,\n\n74\n00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.250\nbut anyhow, they can use it to access\nthat and start to modify those files very\n\n75\n00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.690\neasily, but they could just as\nwell do it from the Web browser.\n\n76\n00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.310\nAll right, so as far as configuration\nthere's not much to be seen here.\n\n77\n00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.220\nAnd that's because it's kind of\nsimilar to the profile manager.\n\n78\n00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.370\nWhere profile manager you\nturn on in the server app,\n\n79\n00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.300\nand then everything else you do via\nthe webpage, that's how the wikis are.\n\n80\n00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.530\nYou turn it on here,\neverything else you do via the webpage.\n\n81\n00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.470\nSo, I'm gonna turn this on.\n\n82\n00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.380\nI'm gonna try and turn it on, there we go.\n\n83\n00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.090\nAnd right now it says,\nall users can create wikis.\n\n84\n00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.250\nI could change that to say that you know,\njust me.\n\n85\n00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.690\nI'm able to create wikis and\nthe other people can use it.\n\n86\n00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.760\nBut, I'm gonna leave it where\nall my users can do this.\n\n87\n00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.400\nThen, everything else is\ndone via the web page.\n\n88\n00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.950\nWe fire up our browser.\n\n89\n00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.940\nAnd when we browse to it,\n\n90\n00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.030\nthe default path is whatever your\nserver name is /wiki, right.\n\n91\n00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.620\nSo, that's the folder that it's gonna\nsend us to, right there, /wiki.\n\n92\n00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.730\nAnd so, in the background,\nI see that Welcome to the server.\n\n93\n00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.960\nI'm now connected to the Wiki\nservice inside of my server app.\n\n94\n00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.230\nNow as you look at it here, it's showing\nus kinda this default overview page.\n\n95\n00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.070\nAnd we don't see a whole lot of\ninformation here because it's locked.\n\n96\n00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.310\nUp at the top it's telling me,\nlog in to access more services.\n\n97\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.060\nAnd I got a little gear here\nwhere I can get About and Help.\n\n98\n00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.880\nAnd I've got the lock which is tied\ninto me not being logged in, all right.\n\n99\n00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.590\nBecause they don't know if\nI'm coming from a Mac, or\n\n100\n00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.810\na Windows machine or a Linux machine.\n\n101\n00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.555\nThey don't know much about me, they just\nknow that I've viewed this web page.\n\n102\n00:05:01.555 --> 00:05:04.095\nI want people to be able\nto view the web page.\n\n103\n00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.935\nBut in order to be able to edit and\nmake changes you've got to authenticate.\n\n104\n00:05:06.935 --> 00:05:09.205\nSo, I'm going to log in as me.\n\n105\n00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:10.895\nAnd so I'll punch in those credentials.\n\n106\n00:05:10.895 --> 00:05:12.645\nAnd your end users would\nneed to do this too,\n\n107\n00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:15.020\nthey're going to log in as themselves.\n\n108\n00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.680\nAnd once they log in,\nthis is where the real power comes in.\n\n109\n00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.420\nUp top, I now have a little pencil icon.\n\n110\n00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.450\nAnd that pencil icon is the edit one.\n\n111\n00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.820\nNow I can edit this page and\nchange what's on it, modify it,\n\n112\n00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.230\nchange the way that it works.\n\n113\n00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.430\nI can hit the plus sign\nto create new Wikis.\n\n114\n00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.640\nYou might want to have several\nWikis that are nested in here.\n\n115\n00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.350\nAnd my little gear,\nI don't just have About and Help,\n\n116\n00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.780\nnow I have my User Settings also.\n\n117\n00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.440\nSo, I can start to set\nsome of the defaults for\n\n118\n00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.190\nhow I experience this page and\nI can log back out again, right?\n\n119\n00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.000\nSo, that's all stuff that we gain by\nmaking sure that we're logged in.\n\n120\n00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.230\nIf I hit my little navigation bar over\nhere, I can see the main wiki that I'm on,\n\n121\n00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.600\nMy Activity and My Documents, so stuff\nthat I've added, and all activities and\n\n122\n00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.830\nwikis, so I can start to see that\ninformation too, and then the Web Calendar\n\n123\n00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.070\nthat we'll talk about a little\nbit more in another episode.\n\n124\n00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.260\nSo the cool thing about a wiki is that you\ncan come in here and start to edit it and\n\n125\n00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.620\nit's super easy.\n\n126\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.240\nWe just hit that little pencil and\nnow we're in edit mode.\n\n127\n00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.860\nAnd when you're in edit mode,\nyou have what's called the Wysiwyg editor.\n\n128\n00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.290\nWysiwyg stands for\nwhat you see is what you get.\n\n129\n00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.370\nSo, if I edit this and I see one thing,\n\n130\n00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.848\nthat's what everybody\nelse is going to see.\n\n131\n00:06:23.848 --> 00:06:28.170\nSo instead of welcome to sever\nmaybe I want it to say welcome\n\n132\n00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.388\nto the ITProTV Lab all right?\n\n133\n00:06:30.388 --> 00:06:32.560\nSo this is gonna be our lab.\n\n134\n00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.440\nAnd then I can come in and\n\n135\n00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.230\nI can specify other things like maybe\nI don't want these icons here anymore.\n\n136\n00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.610\nPeople can get that from their menu\nbar right so I don't need it here, so\n\n137\n00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.340\nI can come in and\nI can delete the individual icons.\n\n138\n00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.870\nOr I can delete the table as a whole and\nstart to get rid of that stuff, right?\n\n139\n00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.310\nAnd so now I'm customizing it and\nchanging it.\n\n140\n00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.330\nThey've got a link to\nthe Profile Manager here.\n\n141\n00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.090\nMaybe I don't want that.\n\n142\n00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.780\nMy regular users don't need to get\nto the Profile Manager, or do they?\n\n143\n00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.205\nIf they want to be able to remote lock or\nwipe their devices,\n\n144\n00:07:03.205 --> 00:07:06.398\nthis might be the main\nhomepage they go to.\n\n145\n00:07:06.398 --> 00:07:08.720\nSo I might wanna leave\nthat link there after all.\n\n146\n00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.010\nRight?\nIts up to me.\n\n147\n00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.870\nBut I just edit this.\n\n148\n00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.040\nI've got all the standard formatting\ntools up here that you'd expect to\n\n149\n00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.210\nnormally have.\n\n150\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.710\nWe can insert images, tables,\n\n151\n00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.320\nyou've got paragraphs and\nthe alignment of the text and so on.\n\n152\n00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.990\nYou can specify all that very easily.\n\n153\n00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.060\nAnd once you're done,\nwe just hit the Save button up top and\n\n154\n00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.230\nit saves it and there's the new web page.\n\n155\n00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.930\nAnd see how it looks exactly\nas it did when I edited it,\n\n156\n00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.190\nthat's the Wiziwig part,\nwhat you see is what you get.\n\n157\n00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:42.120\nI can quickly and easily create web\npages here without having to use\n\n158\n00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.590\nAdobe Dreamweaver or other products\nlike that to create a robust page.\n\n159\n00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.520\nI didn't even have to know HTML, right.\n\n160\n00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.790\nIn the background, it is converting\nthis into hypertext markup language.\n\n161\n00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.034\nThere's the various\nheader column names and\n\n162\n00:07:54.034 --> 00:07:56.109\nother things that are being put in place.\n\n163\n00:07:56.109 --> 00:07:57.069\nI don't have to know any of that.\n\n164\n00:07:57.069 --> 00:08:01.301\nSo no programming knowledge needed, and\nyou can create a web page very quickly and\n\n165\n00:08:01.301 --> 00:08:01.801\neasily.\n\n166\n00:08:01.801 --> 00:08:03.984\nThanks to the Wiki functionality.\n\n167\n00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:07.886\nAll right now, that's a part of it but\nyou can actually go even further.\n\n168\n00:08:07.886 --> 00:08:09.450\nSo I just have the one Wiki here.\n\n169\n00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:14.350\nIf I hit the plus sign up top,\nI can create new pages inside of it.\n\n170\n00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.508\nSo, I might want to have\nan employee handbook.\n\n171\n00:08:17.508 --> 00:08:20.416\nSo I'll go up top,\nI'll hit my plus sign and\n\n172\n00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:23.415\nI'll do New Page in My Documents or\nNew Wiki.\n\n173\n00:08:23.415 --> 00:08:25.676\nI can create an entirely separate Wiki.\n\n174\n00:08:25.676 --> 00:08:28.851\nAnd if I do a new Wiki I might\ncall this the employee handbook.\n\n175\n00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:33.950\nAnd so this is where I'm going to have all\nthe information that employees need on\n\n176\n00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.360\nvacation time and so on.\n\n177\n00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.378\nAnd when you are going to create it you\ncan specify who is allowed to get at it.\n\n178\n00:08:38.378 --> 00:08:44.290\nSo I might say that logged in users get\nread only, anybody else gets no access.\n\n179\n00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.050\nI only want my employees\nto get to the handbook.\n\n180\n00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.200\nAnd while the nice part about\na Wiki is that anybody can edit it,\n\n181\n00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.210\nI don't want the employees\nediting a handbook.\n\n182\n00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:56.210\nBecause it will just a little while for\nsomebody to say, the Wiki says I have two\n\n183\n00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:00.590\nweeks of vacation time, just edit that and\nnow I have three weeks of vacation time.\n\n184\n00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.890\nSo we don't necessarily want them to edit.\n\n185\n00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:04.840\nWe've got the ability to control that.\n\n186\n00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.590\nAnd you can add more groups.\n\n187\n00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.730\nSo, I might have a human\nresources group for example.\n\n188\n00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:12.650\nSo let me create a human resources group,\n\n189\n00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.500\nactually here I'll do it\nin the server manager, so\n\n190\n00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.480\nI'm going to go into groups and I'll just\ncreate a group called human resources.\n\n191\n00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:24.280\nAnd I do want the human resources group\nto be able to edit this Wiki, right.\n\n192\n00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.940\nThey're the ones who define\nthat employee handbook.\n\n193\n00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:33.680\nSo back here where it's asking for that\ngroup name, I can type in human resources.\n\n194\n00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.540\nAnd I'm gonna give them read and write.\n\n195\n00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.460\nSo if you're in the human resources group\nyou'll be able to edit the employee\n\n196\n00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.970\nhandbook, everybody else will\njust be able to read it.\n\n197\n00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.540\nAnd, you can send email\nnotifications to new members,\n\n198\n00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.470\nto let them know they\nhave that new access.\n\n199\n00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:51.700\nBut, we do need to be careful with that,\nbecause you can spam people with too much\n\n200\n00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.000\nhere, I've got all logged in users,\nthat would be anybody who has an account.\n\n201\n00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.580\nThis could be quite a large amount\nof people, I'm not going to do that.\n\n202\n00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.960\nAlright, then we can set a Wiki icon,\nyou know what we want it to look like,\n\n203\n00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.100\nyou can upload your own image or\nit get's the default one and\n\n204\n00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.240\nyou can pick the color scheme, so maybe\nI want to go, I'll go green on this one.\n\n205\n00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.160\nAnd we'll create it.\n\n206\n00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.080\nAlright.\nSo\n\n207\n00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.840\nwhen that's done,\nnow I've got an all new Wiki site.\n\n208\n00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.440\nRight.\n\n209\n00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.420\nI've got my main Wiki site that I was on\nearlier, so the main site was this guy\n\n210\n00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:24.600\nright here and I just hit my navigation\nbutton and click on the main Wiki link.\n\n211\n00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.070\nBut under this,\nyou can go to all Wiki's and\n\n212\n00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.650\nnow you'll see a list of all the other\nWiki's that have been created.\n\n213\n00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.890\nAnd here's that employee\nhandbook that I made.\n\n214\n00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.120\nAnd so I can go into employee handbook and\nnow I see it.\n\n215\n00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.600\nWe get this default page that we can\nnow edit and start to putting content.\n\n216\n00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.750\nAnd so I would tell my human resources\nteam, all right, you guys have a Wiki.\n\n217\n00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:47.450\nThey would browse to it and start to\nedit it, start to put in the data.\n\n218\n00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.708\nAnd they'll probably want to put\nin a table of contents type thing.\n\n219\n00:10:50.708 --> 00:10:52.910\nRight?\nThis is our main document, and so\n\n220\n00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.890\nwe'll have sub-documents\nthat go underneath it.\n\n221\n00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.810\nSo there might be a vacation request form.\n\n222\n00:10:58.810 --> 00:10:59.930\nAnd so you would put that in here.\n\n223\n00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.110\nYou'd go under Documents.\n\n224\n00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.350\nAnd you'd add the document in here and\nthen you could go and\n\n225\n00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.590\ncreate a link to it from that main page.\n\n226\n00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.710\nOr you can just edit and\nadd more pages right from here.\n\n227\n00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:15.540\nSo when I hit the plus sign, now instead\nof seeing New Page in My Documents.\n\n228\n00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:20.030\nI see new page in Employee Handbook,\nand upload file to Employee Handbook.\n\n229\n00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.630\nWe're now putting this in\nthe Employee Handbook.\n\n230\n00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.320\nSo this might be my Vacation Policy.\n\n231\n00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.020\nSo, I'll add that page.\n\n232\n00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:33.300\nAnd then I might add another page for,\nactually I guess I need to save that.\n\n233\n00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:38.021\nSo, there's my Vacation Policy,\nand I might add another page for\n\n234\n00:11:38.021 --> 00:11:39.548\na Sick Leave Policy.\n\n235\n00:11:41.917 --> 00:11:43.010\nSo, we'll add that in, too.\n\n236\n00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.980\nAnd so now, I've got a couple of pages,\n\n237\n00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.930\nand what's gonna happen is if I go back\nto the main, oops got to hit save.\n\n238\n00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.390\nIf you don't hit save the page disappears.\n\n239\n00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:57.950\nSo now when I go to the main employee\nhandbook page right over here I can see\n\n240\n00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:01.140\nrecent documents and\nI can see sick leave and vacation policy.\n\n241\n00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.370\nBut what happens over time as I edit\nmore and more of this stuff and\n\n242\n00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.430\nthose things start to go away they're\nnot going to show up here anymore.\n\n243\n00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.740\nSo I might want to put\nlinks In the page itself.\n\n244\n00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:16.330\nSo if somebody wants to get to that\nsick leave policy I can link to that.\n\n245\n00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:22.700\nSo if I edit this main page, I can go down\nhere and I can start to add entries for\n\n246\n00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:28.240\nthe sick leave policy and\nvacation policy and all of those.\n\n247\n00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.060\nI'll try and\nmake it look somewhat professional.\n\n248\n00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.860\nAnd each of those can be turned\ninto links as part of the process.\n\n249\n00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:42.810\nSo whenever I create something like that,\nyou'll see this button up top,\n\n250\n00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:48.050\nwe've got insert an image,\ninsert a table, add an HTML snippet,\n\n251\n00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:51.470\nso I could reference another page, and\nyou've got several different things.\n\n252\n00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.960\nHere I can add a link to another page or\nexternal URL.\n\n253\n00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:00.370\nAnd I can actually pick sick leave policy\nand vacation right outta there, I picked\n\n254\n00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:04.330\nthe wrong one, so now it's linking to the\nwrong thing, but I can link it that way.\n\n255\n00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:09.060\nAnd so here's the sick leave policy and I\nwanna link that to the sick leave policy.\n\n256\n00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:14.300\nAnd I need to change this one so that it's\nactually linked to the vacation policy.\n\n257\n00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:19.120\nAnd now, those links will appear right\nthere on the homepage and so, I don't have\n\n258\n00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.340\nto worry about whether they show up under\nrecent or not, it'll always be right here.\n\n259\n00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.250\nVery easy to do this.\n\n260\n00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:27.340\nYou guys see where, I don't have to\nbe a web wizard to create this stuff,\n\n261\n00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.470\nI just need to have an idea of\nwhat I want, and I can built\n\n262\n00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:34.110\nthe main page page out as like a table of\ncontents, links to all these other ones.\n\n263\n00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:38.510\nAnd the links could be a page like\nI just did or they could be files.\n\n264\n00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.300\nIf I'd uploaded a file this\ncould be a link to a pdf or\n\n265\n00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.290\nsome other kind of document and\nI would just link right into that.\n\n266\n00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.650\nYou got that, that flexibility.\n\n267\n00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:51.640\nSo, whats going on in the background\non this is that, I'm telling it to edit\n\n268\n00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.980\nstuff and technically the server is using\nWebDAV to do this editing for me but\n\n269\n00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.090\nit's all on the back end,\non the server end.\n\n270\n00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:01.150\nIf I use true WebDAV to connect to\nthe Wiki then I can browse it like\n\n271\n00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:01.860\na file system.\n\n272\n00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.140\nAnd that's where you normally use\nthird party software to do that.\n\n273\n00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.780\nSo it is all being leveraged\nby WebDAV in the background.\n\n274\n00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.640\nAnd we're editing, creating the pages and\n\n275\n00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.420\ndoing it all entirely from\nwithin the web browser.\n\n276\n00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.040\nJust pretty powerful.\n\n277\n00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.510\nAnd you can create as many Wikis as you\nwant, you can create a ton of them.\n\n278\n00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.950\nSome you can make read only,\nsome you can make where they can change,\n\n279\n00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.520\nyou can get the full advantages of Wiki.\n\n280\n00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.190\nIf you make it read only,\n\n281\n00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:26.150\nit's really just like a regular web\nserver with a super easy editor, and\n\n282\n00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:30.140\nthat's valuable in and of itself,\neven if you don't use the Wiki side of it.\n\n283\n00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.810\nBut if you really leverage the Wiki side,\nand you let people update the documents\n\n284\n00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:39.420\nfor you, you can start to create something\nlike a knowledge base or a Wikipedia.\n\n285\n00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.790\nThat's a living document that's growing\nwith all of your corporate knowledge,\n\n286\n00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.980\nright, they call it your corporate tribal\nknowledge that people build as they work\n\n287\n00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:46.870\nat your company.\n\n288\n00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.830\nThey can start putting that data here,\nand now we get knowledge transfer.\n\n289\n00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.070\nSo it's a very powerful utility.\n\n290\n00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.470\nNow there is another way\nthat we can use the Wikis.\n\n291\n00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:59.270\nSo normally, we're using it just as\na Wiki, like this, as web pages.\n\n292\n00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.050\nAnd you'll see as I create them,\nthey start to get added up here, so\n\n293\n00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:05.050\nI see my Wikis, and\nthen my Employee Handbook, and\n\n294\n00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:09.030\nI can always jump back to the main page,\nwhere I get a list of my various Wikis.\n\n295\n00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:12.610\nWell, you can also create blogs.\n\n296\n00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:14.506\nA blog is like a Wiki.\n\n297\n00:15:14.506 --> 00:15:17.580\nIf I have a blog, so\na web page where I post updates and\n\n298\n00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.100\nnews articles and things like that,\nit's me editing the page.\n\n299\n00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:21.970\nIt's a blog.\n\n300\n00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:22.920\nBut nobody else can edit it.\n\n301\n00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.000\nEverybody else can just see it.\n\n302\n00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.780\nSo if I wanted to create Don's IT Blog and\npost great IT news to it every single day,\n\n303\n00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.890\nwell, I could actually\nleverage this server to do it.\n\n304\n00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.000\nNot as a Wiki though.\n\n305\n00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.910\nWith a Wiki, I have to customize\nthis whole page, and edit it.\n\n306\n00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:41.010\nBut I wanna post articles,\nI want it to be sorted by date,\n\n307\n00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:43.050\nthe way that blogs typically are.\n\n308\n00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:45.510\nYou can't really do that with\na standard Wiki and have it nice and\n\n309\n00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:46.890\neasy to work with.\n\n310\n00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:51.273\nBut, Apple has baked blog support\nright into this so that we can go and\n\n311\n00:15:51.273 --> 00:15:52.869\ncreate a blog if we want.\n\n312\n00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:56.370\nAnd what you basically do,\nis you end up creating a Wiki and\n\n313\n00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:59.386\nthen changing its settings\nto make it into a blog.\n\n314\n00:15:59.386 --> 00:16:01.012\nSo, let me show you how that works.\n\n315\n00:16:01.012 --> 00:16:07.013\nI'm gonna add another Wiki and\nI'm gonna call this one Don's IT Blog,\n\n316\n00:16:07.013 --> 00:16:10.327\nit's gonna be awesome let me tell you.\n\n317\n00:16:10.327 --> 00:16:13.340\nThere's so many people do a better job\nthat I would so I'm gonna leave that be.\n\n318\n00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.300\nBut I'm gonna go and create one,\nand I'm gonna come in here and\n\n319\n00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.280\nI'm gonna set it so that I,\nwhoop, that's not what I wanted.\n\n320\n00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.168\nThere we go.\n\n321\n00:16:24.168 --> 00:16:27.160\nIt was trying to insert my V-card details,\nI wanted my actual account.\n\n322\n00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.440\nIt's not gonna let me insert my account,\nis it?\n\n323\n00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.970\nWell anyhow, so I'll set so\nthat I have read and write.\n\n324\n00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:36.080\nAnd that unauthenticated users,\neverybody else, they will get read access.\n\n325\n00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.410\nI want this to be a public blog.\n\n326\n00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.500\nI want people to be able to see it,\nI don't want them to change it,\n\n327\n00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.630\nI just want them to be able to see it.\n\n328\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.480\nSo, I'll punch that in.\n\n329\n00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.410\nSo, I continue to do that and\nwe'll create it.\n\n330\n00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:53.090\nI guess I could pick,\nI'll make my blog orange, there we go.\n\n331\n00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:55.260\nAll right, so now it's created a wiki, and\n\n332\n00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:59.060\nit is just a standard wiki,\nit doesn't know that it's a blog.\n\n333\n00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.920\nBut I can go up here into the Settings,\nand\n\n334\n00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.990\nin the Settings you've got Wiki Settings.\n\n335\n00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.220\nAnd here's where we can customize\nhow the wiki itself works.\n\n336\n00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.860\nAnd so, I got the Wiki Name,\nDon's IT Blog, the Wiki Description, and\n\n337\n00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.350\nthen Services, Calendar, and Blog.\n\n338\n00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:18.318\nYou can actually host a calendar in here.\n\n339\n00:17:18.318 --> 00:17:21.250\nSo, it'll actually render a calendar on\nscreen, that can be edited, and updated,\n\n340\n00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:25.700\nso that if you wanted a community\ncalendar, and you can do a blog.\n\n341\n00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.600\nAnd so, I'm gonna check that little box,\nright there.\n\n342\n00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.690\nSo, this is gonna be Don's IT Blog,\nand I check that box so\n\n343\n00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.360\nthat it knows that I'm\ngoing to have that service.\n\n344\n00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.300\nAll right, and I'll save that.\n\n345\n00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.170\nAnd now the screen kind of refreshes as it\nconverts itself to be ready to handle that\n\n346\n00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:40.588\nblog type activity.\n\n347\n00:17:40.588 --> 00:17:43.170\nNow I'm gonna go back into those Settings\nreal quick because there are a few other\n\n348\n00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.280\nthings I wanted to point out in here.\n\n349\n00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.590\nYou've also got the Appearance if you\nchange your mind about the color or\n\n350\n00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.890\nthe banner you can customize that stuff.\n\n351\n00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.830\nAnd you've got the Permissions.\n\n352\n00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.580\nAnd so I might wanna come back in here and\nchange this and\n\n353\n00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:59.780\nmodify it somehow to say like logged\nin users only get read access.\n\n354\n00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.390\nAnd I'm an admin so\nI'm gonna have write access anyway or\n\n355\n00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:03.870\nI can punch in other users.\n\n356\n00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:07.930\nWe can always modify that stuff after\nthe fact if you need to, all right.\n\n357\n00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:11.290\nAnd then Comments,\nmaybe I don't want comments, like ugh,\n\n358\n00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.880\npeople post comments I don't want that.\n\n359\n00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:18.180\nOr I do, I wanna allow anybody,\nbut I'm gonna moderate it.\n\n360\n00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:22.480\nSo if it's an anonymous comment I have to\napprove it before it shows up on the site,\n\n361\n00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.820\nbut if somebody logs in, it'll have it.\n\n362\n00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.280\nSo we can have full\nComment Moderation right there, and\n\n363\n00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:31.270\nthat's a really handy feature, cuz public\nblogs, they get all sorts of spam and\n\n364\n00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.400\njunk in them all the time.\n\n365\n00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.115\nSo this is a chance for\nus to kind of curtail that a little bit.\n\n366\n00:18:37.435 --> 00:18:40.365\nAll right, now one thing you\nmight notice is that my wiki\n\n367\n00:18:40.365 --> 00:18:42.085\ndidn't really change, did it?\n\n368\n00:18:42.085 --> 00:18:45.695\nIt still looks the same, but\nit actually did, it's just hard to notice.\n\n369\n00:18:45.695 --> 00:18:50.420\nUp here in the navigation bar,\nI got a new entry called Blog.\n\n370\n00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.910\nAnd if I click on that,\nthat's gonna take me to my blog view.\n\n371\n00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:59.430\nAnd in the blog view is where we\nstart to see the posts that we make.\n\n372\n00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.580\nNow the posts are just documents.\n\n373\n00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:06.823\nAnd so when I go up here and hit the +,\nyou'll see where I've got New Page,\n\n374\n00:19:06.823 --> 00:19:11.087\nUpload a File, New Blog Post,\nand so I can do a new blog post.\n\n375\n00:19:11.087 --> 00:19:17.360\nAnd I can come in here and\nI can say Apple announces iPhone 7.\n\n376\n00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.638\nI'm predicting the future in\nthe easiest way possible,\n\n377\n00:19:19.638 --> 00:19:21.209\ncuz you know there'll be an iPhone 7.\n\n378\n00:19:21.209 --> 00:19:25.940\nSo I'll go ahead and do that,\nand here's my new post.\n\n379\n00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:30.106\nAnd so I can edit this, well,\nI'm editing it right now I guess.\n\n380\n00:19:30.106 --> 00:19:32.540\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njust highlight all that junk.\n\n381\n00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:41.268\nAnd say, it's the best iPhone\nreleased since the iPhone 6.\n\n382\n00:19:41.268 --> 00:19:43.847\nIt's like way better, and\nway better than a 5, believe me.\n\n383\n00:19:43.847 --> 00:19:47.173\nSo we can post in all our information,\nand then we can save it, and now,\n\n384\n00:19:47.173 --> 00:19:49.040\nI just made my first blog post.\n\n385\n00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.460\nAnd so somebody browsing into my blog,\nwill now see that.\n\n386\n00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.740\nAnd as I add more posts,\nI'll add another blog post.\n\n387\n00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:00.860\nIt's sorting them as like cards, by date\nand putting that information so Microsoft\n\n388\n00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:06.360\nannounces Windows 11, which goes to 11.\n\n389\n00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.270\nAnd so we can come in and put that in,\n\n390\n00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.160\nI'll just leave it at the default text and\nsave it.\n\n391\n00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:15.025\nSo now I'm gonna start getting that\nmuch more traditional blog type view\n\n392\n00:20:15.025 --> 00:20:19.840\nwhere when I come in I see, here's my\nfirst post, here's my second post.\n\n393\n00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.770\nAnd users can come in and they can read\nthat, they can see the information and\n\n394\n00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.080\nit works much more like what\nwe expect a blog to be.\n\n395\n00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.130\n>> Now Don, you showed us briefly\nthere that the calendar service,\n\n396\n00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.490\nthe blog service is enabled\nwhen you turn blogs on.\n\n397\n00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:36.200\nSo, see that this is coming through Safari\nI can only imagine that you've got some\n\n398\n00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.210\nkind of web site service and it's\nrunning and it has to be enabled right?\n\n399\n00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:43.230\n>> Yeah this is all powered by the website\nservice and even if you don't turn it on,\n\n400\n00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.270\nthis turns it on, this makes it fire up so\n\n401\n00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:48.403\nyou gotta Apache under the hood\nthat's powering all of this.\n\n402\n00:20:48.403 --> 00:20:52.026\nAnd it's really just loading\nin those wiki pages for\n\n403\n00:20:52.026 --> 00:20:54.260\nyou to get it set up and in place.\n\n404\n00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.372\nYou don't really have to mess around with\nthe file system on this one much, but\n\n405\n00:20:57.372 --> 00:20:59.540\nif you ever want to see where\nall this junk is ending up,\n\n406\n00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.090\nit's actually ending up in\nkind of a little database.\n\n407\n00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:07.682\nIf you browse to /Library/Server/Wiki,\n\n408\n00:21:07.682 --> 00:21:14.597\nI know I screwed up that whole\ntyping thing right there,\n\n409\n00:21:14.597 --> 00:21:18.900\nso /Library/Server/Wiki/.\n\n410\n00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:25.750\nIf you look around in there, what you'll\nsee is it's got a PostgreSQL database.\n\n411\n00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:29.180\nSo it's got a database that's\nstoring all the wiki pages, and\n\n412\n00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.870\nso it's right here, and that's where\nthe pages are being rendered from.\n\n413\n00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:37.330\nSo what happens is you have\nthe Apache service that queries\n\n414\n00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:41.160\nthe database to find out what's your home\npage, all right, what links are off of it.\n\n415\n00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:41.860\nWhen you click a link,\n\n416\n00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.850\nwhat's the content of that page\nall coming out of that database.\n\n417\n00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.205\nI didn't set any of that up,\nI flipped an on switch.\n\n418\n00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:51.644\nSo you may have never even heard of\nPostgreSQL, but it's a very common\n\n419\n00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:57.320\ndatabase that's out there that's not\nthe easiest thing to get up and running.\n\n420\n00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.390\nYou didn't have to know that,\nyou didn't even have to know it existed.\n\n421\n00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:01.220\nIt's all in the background,\nit's all done for us.\n\n422\n00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.040\nSo you rarely have to get in here and\nmess with anything.\n\n423\n00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.996\nBut you've got your preferences, files and\nthings to be able to mess with that.\n\n424\n00:22:07.996 --> 00:22:12.623\nI can't think of an example where I've\never had to go in here and change it.\n\n425\n00:22:12.623 --> 00:22:14.491\nThe only thing I didn't\nshow is the calendar.\n\n426\n00:22:14.491 --> 00:22:19.009\nIf I go into the calendar system,\nwhen I edited my wiki, for example,\n\n427\n00:22:19.009 --> 00:22:21.320\nand I go back into my Wiki Settings.\n\n428\n00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.180\nI'd turn on the blog.\n\n429\n00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:26.600\nIf I turn on the Calendar too,\nI can save that, and\n\n430\n00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.820\nnow I get a new option up here for\nthe Calendar.\n\n431\n00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:33.670\nAnd so I can choose Calendar, and now\nI'm gonna view this nice, new calendar.\n\n432\n00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:37.790\nAnd when I go to add entries up here,\nwell, I have New Page,\n\n433\n00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:39.590\nUpload File, New Blog Post.\n\n434\n00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:42.490\nI don't have new calendar item.\n\n435\n00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:48.210\nWell, the reason is this calendar is not\nindependently powered by the wiki service.\n\n436\n00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:51.070\nThis is powered by the calendar service,\nand\n\n437\n00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.020\nwe haven't turned\nthe calendar service on yet.\n\n438\n00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.490\nSo we gotta have that turned\non before this works.\n\n439\n00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.600\nSo here it's just telling me that it can't\naccess it because the calendar service\n\n440\n00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.510\nis not running.\n\n441\n00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.582\nSo if I go back to my server app and\nI turn that on, we'll see it.\n\n442\n00:23:01.582 --> 00:23:04.006\nAnd we're gonna have an episode\non the calendar service later, so\n\n443\n00:23:04.006 --> 00:23:05.920\nI don't want to send too much time on it.\n\n444\n00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.120\nBut I can go and turn this on, and\n\n445\n00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:12.340\nnow I have a full blown calendar here\nthat we will be able to add entries to.\n\n446\n00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.680\nAnd you don't use the + up\nhere to add the entries,\n\n447\n00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.880\nit's gonna be really hard to see but,\n\n448\n00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.420\nright here we have a little + where we can\nadd calendar entries and put it in place.\n\n449\n00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.700\nBecause it's not the wiki services\nadding the calendar entry,\n\n450\n00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:25.550\nit's the calendar service.\n\n451\n00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:29.720\nWhat it's actually doing is using CalDAV,\nthe Calendar Distributed Authoring and\n\n452\n00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.670\nVersioning, to edit the calendar for\nus through our web browser.\n\n453\n00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:37.750\nSo it is a neat system if mine\nwould ever load up, there we go.\n\n454\n00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.970\nAnd so that one's gonna start and\n\n455\n00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.270\nwe'll see if we can at least\nget it to display really quick.\n\n456\n00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.938\nAnd now you can have that community\ncalendar type of experience.\n\n457\n00:23:44.938 --> 00:23:48.520\n>> So the web server you didn't have to\nturn on, that happened automatically.\n\n458\n00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.680\nBut if you're gonna use calendar,\nyou gotta remember,\n\n459\n00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.710\nyou have to go in there and manually\nturn it on to get that functionality.\n\n460\n00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:57.324\n>> That's exactly it and mine is trying\nto get the events from the server now, so\n\n461\n00:23:57.324 --> 00:23:58.776\nit's actually reaching out.\n\n462\n00:23:58.776 --> 00:24:01.377\nSo you start to see how those\ntwo pieces talk together.\n\n463\n00:24:01.377 --> 00:24:02.468\nAnd so it's reaching out.\n\n464\n00:24:02.468 --> 00:24:03.057\nThere we go.\n\n465\n00:24:03.057 --> 00:24:04.389\nSo now it's loaded my calendar.\n\n466\n00:24:04.389 --> 00:24:07.800\nAnd my calendar's empty so\nI need to add a calendar entry.\n\n467\n00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.280\nBut up top,\nI still don't have an add calendar\n\n468\n00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:15.035\nbecause I've gotta use this\nlittle button down here.\n\n469\n00:24:15.035 --> 00:24:18.805\nAnd so now I can come in and\nI can add a new calendar.\n\n470\n00:24:18.805 --> 00:24:24.295\nSo I'll call this Don's IT calendar,\nand I'll create that.\n\n471\n00:24:25.695 --> 00:24:29.935\nAnd now I can pull up Don's IT calendar\nand we can start to see those events.\n\n472\n00:24:29.935 --> 00:24:36.170\nI'll create a new event, which we'll\ncall the Apple show or whatever it is.\n\n473\n00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:37.667\nWe'll do live from London.\n\n474\n00:24:37.667 --> 00:24:40.530\nI mean, if we're gonna go big,\nwe might as well go all out.\n\n475\n00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:43.160\nRight.\nSo I'll go in here and create that, and so\n\n476\n00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.470\nnow I start to have\nthese calendar entries.\n\n477\n00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:49.580\nAnd let's make that show a little longer,\nthat's a short show.\n\n478\n00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.675\nSo we'll run it all the way through,\nlike 3 PM.\n\n479\n00:24:54.519 --> 00:24:55.520\nThere we go.\n\n480\n00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.800\nAnd now the calendar starts lighting up.\n\n481\n00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.080\nAnd depending on how I set\nthe permissions on this,\n\n482\n00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.800\nI can dictate whether I want\neverybody to be able to come in and\n\n483\n00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.890\ncreate events or\nif this needs to be a central thing.\n\n484\n00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:09.680\nIf you're doing something like a vacation\ncalendar to keep track of when people\n\n485\n00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:13.240\nare on vacation and all that, you probably\ndon't want everybody editing that.\n\n486\n00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.100\nYou want Human Resources editing it.\n\n487\n00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.940\nSo you can adjust the permissions and\nsettings on this too.\n\n488\n00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.110\nThat's really all done\nthrough the calendar service.\n\n489\n00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:23.306\n>> Can you set it as well to where other\npeople can view it if they wanna say,\n\n490\n00:25:23.306 --> 00:25:25.512\nhey okay what's Don doing\non this specific day?\n\n491\n00:25:25.512 --> 00:25:27.775\nThey can come to this blog,\nthey can see what you're doing, or\n\n492\n00:25:27.775 --> 00:25:29.795\nis that just something separate\nthat you have to set up?\n\n493\n00:25:29.795 --> 00:25:32.427\n>> No, it's controlled by your\nwiki at this point, and so\n\n494\n00:25:32.427 --> 00:25:36.413\nif you've given them access to your wiki\nthen they'll be able to see that calendar.\n\n495\n00:25:36.413 --> 00:25:39.310\nAs far as editing it that's where\nthe counter service comes in.\n\n496\n00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:42.500\nBut as far as viewing it you could\nactually go and tweak the permissions of\n\n497\n00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:46.170\nthe counter service and break it but\nby default they'll be able to see it.\n\n498\n00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:49.010\nSo just kind of a neat\nlittle extension of it.\n\n499\n00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:52.030\nThe key thing that I want you to take away\nfrom this especially for the exam but\n\n500\n00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:55.900\nalso for real life is the Wiki\nservices is more then just Wiki's.\n\n501\n00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:56.680\nRight.\n\n502\n00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.530\nYes, it does Wikis.\n\n503\n00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:58.830\nIt does a great job with that.\n\n504\n00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.590\nBut it also does blogs,\n\n505\n00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:05.540\nit also does calendar and\nyou can even use it for read only pages.\n\n506\n00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:09.730\nSo not very Wiki-like, but just as\na convenient web editor so that you can\n\n507\n00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:14.090\nquickly create a hierarchy of pages and\nnot have to be some kind of crazy expert.\n\n508\n00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:18.590\nNow on a positive side this\nis really easy to get going.\n\n509\n00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:21.930\nOn a negative side Apple\ndoesn't update it very often.\n\n510\n00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:26.942\nThis Wiki service has not changed in\nthe last three or four versions of OS ten.\n\n511\n00:26:26.942 --> 00:26:29.936\nSo if you're looking for\nsomething with great extensibility and\n\n512\n00:26:29.936 --> 00:26:34.070\nthe latest features, well that's where\nWordPress and things like that come in.\n\n513\n00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:38.100\nBut if you want a stable rock solid blog\nservice that you can power quickly and\n\n514\n00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.955\neasily, this works out great.\n\n515\n00:26:39.955 --> 00:26:43.085\nAnd so I find that a lot of companies\nleverage this for intranet sites,\n\n516\n00:26:43.085 --> 00:26:44.665\nfor internal websites.\n\n517\n00:26:44.665 --> 00:26:48.815\nThings like the employee handbook\nexample there, or a company calendar,\n\n518\n00:26:48.815 --> 00:26:50.435\ncompany newsletter stuff like that.\n\n519\n00:26:50.435 --> 00:26:53.060\nReally lends itself well\nto being managed this way.\n\n520\n00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.680\nAnd it's pretty straightforward.\n\n521\n00:26:54.680 --> 00:27:00.140\nNow do remember that these\nare living things that are stored in\n\n522\n00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:03.750\nthat post SQL database that\nwe don't normally see.\n\n523\n00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:08.530\nSo, what happens if I need to replace\nmy server or if my server crashes?\n\n524\n00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:11.910\nWell you need to make sure you got\na time machine backup of this thing.\n\n525\n00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:12.770\nThis is a lot harder.\n\n526\n00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:14.730\nWe can't just copy the files\nsomewhere else and\n\n527\n00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:16.970\nhave them somewhere like\nwe could with a website.\n\n528\n00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:20.240\nBecause there's a database involved, you\nreally should be making sure you do your\n\n529\n00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.060\ntime machine backups so\nthat you can restore that with the system.\n\n530\n00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:27.340\nSo that's a key thing to take away on\nthis is that back ups are a little more\n\n531\n00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.860\nimportant than some of the other services.\n\n532\n00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.150\n>> That's a very cool technology.\n\n533\n00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:32.240\nIt seems like it's very fun.\n\n534\n00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.750\nNow if I set up a Wiki,\n\n535\n00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:36.980\nthere's not gonna be too many pages in\nit there as far as knowledge base goes.\n\n536\n00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.630\nBut Don, it does look like we're\ncoming to the end of another episode.\n\n537\n00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:43.220\nBut before we sign out, do you have\nany additional words of wisdom?\n\n538\n00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.700\n>> I guess one thing would be,\na gotcha that I've seen,\n\n539\n00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:50.290\nI said how if we turn on the Wiki service,\nit's gonna turn on the web service for us.\n\n540\n00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:52.700\nYou don't actually have to have\nthe web service on and, in fact,\n\n541\n00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:56.850\nif it's not on you won't see a green dot\nappear beside it, but it still does work.\n\n542\n00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:01.430\nSo If you're in your server app and\nyou've got wiki turned on and\n\n543\n00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:03.970\nyou noticed your website service is off.\n\n544\n00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:08.490\nSee how I was able to turn websites\noff but the wiki service is still lit?\n\n545\n00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:10.800\nWhat's going on is\nApache is still running.\n\n546\n00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.800\nApache shut off our other services,\nbut it's kept the wiki service live.\n\n547\n00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.850\nSo don't feel like you have to start\nthe default website if you don't want to.\n\n548\n00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:21.020\nYou can just have\nthe blog service running.\n\n549\n00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.770\nThe web server is running, even though\nwe don't have that green light.\n\n550\n00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.980\nAnd back here is, what you'll see is these\nare all, like, sub directories, right.\n\n551\n00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:34.180\nThis slash wiki is an alias created on\nthe web server, and that alias is running.\n\n552\n00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.410\nAll the other aliases have been turned\noff, cuz I stopped the website server.\n\n553\n00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:41.230\nSo, they are two sort\nof independent things,\n\n554\n00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:44.390\nalthough Wiki service is\nlying on top of Apache.\n\n555\n00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.490\n>> Don we thank you for that information,\nand we thank you the viewer for watching.\n\n556\n00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:51.015\nBut we're gonna go ahead and sign out here\nat ITProTV, I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n557\n00:28:51.015 --> 00:28:51.823\n>> And I'm Don

Bryan,\n\n3\n00:00:16.356 --> 00:00:20.695\nand in today's episode we're continuing\nthrough our OS 10 Server Essentials and\n\n4\n00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:23.870\nwe're looking at today using\ncollaborative services.\n\n5\n00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.500\nAnd joining us into the studios today\nis none other than Mr. Don Pizett.\n\n6\n00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.740\nDon, how you doing today, sir?\n\n7\n00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.520\n>> I'm doing great, Wes,\n\n8\n00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.310\nready to dive right back into\nour collaborative services.\n\n9\n00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.905\nAnd the collaboration that we're gonna\nlook at in this one is the mail server,\n\n10\n00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:38.719\nwhich is honestly probably the primary way\nthat people communicate on the internet\n\n11\n00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.300\nthese days, is via email.\n\n12\n00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.300\nYou know we do have several services\nbuild into these server app that let us\n\n13\n00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.140\ntalk to other people,\n\n14\n00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.315\nwe got things like the messages\nservice where you can do live chat.\n\n15\n00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:52.470\nBut email is a tried and true technology,\nit's been around a long time and, for\n\n16\n00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.460\na lot of us, if we wanna set up email,\nwhat do you do?\n\n17\n00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.850\nYou just let somebody else run it for you.\n\n18\n00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.000\nYou sign up for iCloud accounts or\nGmail, Hotmail.\n\n19\n00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.920\nYou might do Office 365, or\n\n20\n00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.290\nsomething like that where they\ncompletely host your email environment.\n\n21\n00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.400\nBut there's plenty of people that still\nneed to run their own mail server and\n\n22\n00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.010\nhave it completely in their control.\n\n23\n00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.420\nAnd if you're one of those people, well,\n\n24\n00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.920\nthe OS10 server app actually\nworks out really well for that.\n\n25\n00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.420\nIt's got a mail server built right\ninto it that we can turn on.\n\n26\n00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.880\nYou'll see it's really easy to\nget it configured and up and\n\n27\n00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.470\nrunning and that's really a nice thing.\n\n28\n00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.880\nBecause the mail server that's a part of\nthe server app, it's all built on top of,\n\n29\n00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.110\nlook I said this before right,\nbuilt on top of BSD Unix, under the hood.\n\n30\n00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.660\nAnd Unix has a number of different mail\nserver programs that are part of it and\n\n31\n00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.060\nthey've been around a long time, open\nsource, anybody can throw them on there.\n\n32\n00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.870\nBut they're very complex.\n\n33\n00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.090\nThey're very difficult to configure, and\n\n34\n00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.020\nyou'll find that in order to run a mail\nserver, it's not just one service.\n\n35\n00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.570\nIt's actually 4 or\n\n36\n00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.500\n5 different services all tied together\nto provide your mail functionality.\n\n37\n00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.170\nAnd that's really hard to set up.\n\n38\n00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.030\nSo what Apple has done is they've stepped\nin, they've taken all that open source\n\n39\n00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.030\nstuff, they've put it all together for\nyou, they've pre-configured it.\n\n40\n00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.110\nAnd we just need to flip an on switch and\nthen tweak it as we need it.\n\n41\n00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.720\nSo it makes what would normally be\na pretty difficult process, super easy.\n\n42\n00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.500\nSo, just to kind of run down some of\nthe solutions I'm talking about here.\n\n43\n00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.350\nWhen we think of a mail server,\nwhat do you think?\n\n44\n00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.304\nYou think, I need to be able to\nwrite an email, send it, and\n\n45\n00:02:19.304 --> 00:02:21.500\nthen I need to be able\nto receive an email.\n\n46\n00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.660\nWell, a lot of what you do is\nthrough your mail client, right?\n\n47\n00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.250\nYou write your email in the mail client.\n\n48\n00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.000\nSo, you need to be able to send\na copy of an email to a server,\n\n49\n00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.800\nthe server needs to be able to receive\nthat email, find the destination person,\n\n50\n00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.190\nand send it over to them so\nthey can get the email.\n\n51\n00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.570\nAnd there might be other things that\nwe wanna do during that process,\n\n52\n00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.340\nlike we might want to scan the email for\nviruses, or scan it for spam.\n\n53\n00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.150\nWe might want to do a pending\ndisclaimer to the bottom of the email.\n\n54\n00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.890\nThere's a lot of extra actions\nthat we might wanna perform, and\n\n55\n00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.310\nthe server is what's gonna\nhave to perform those.\n\n56\n00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.370\nSo, the pieces that Apple put\ntogether to do this are pretty neat.\n\n57\n00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.540\nThe main one, the key component under\nthe hood, it's what's called Postfix.\n\n58\n00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.720\nPostfix is an open source SMTP server,\nthat's the Simple Mail Transport Protocol.\n\n59\n00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.880\nAnd SMTP, it's the standard for\nemail transport in every system\n\n60\n00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.530\nin the entire world, so it doesn't matter\nif it's Unix or Windows, Linux, whatever.\n\n61\n00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.770\nIt doesn't matter if it's\nApple's mail server or\n\n62\n00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.310\nMicrosoft's Exchange or whoever\nowns Lotus these days, or whatever.\n\n63\n00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.840\nIt doesn't really matter\nwho the mail server is.\n\n64\n00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.600\nThey all use SMTP to move email back and\nforth.\n\n65\n00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.060\nAnd so Postfix is really the heart of\nthe OS X server app's mail server.\n\n66\n00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.250\nAnd that's the key one that's running,\nhandling the email exchange.\n\n67\n00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.320\nThe only problem with Postfix is it's\ndesigned to handle exchanges between\n\n68\n00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.530\nservers.\n\n69\n00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.730\nIt's not designed to handle exchanges\nbetween clients and the server.\n\n70\n00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.660\nSo we need something else to allow our\nclients to be able to see their email.\n\n71\n00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.760\nAnd for that Apple uses a software\npackage called Dovecot.\n\n72\n00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.080\nAnd Dovecot is another open source package\nand it provides POP and IMAP support.\n\n73\n00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.780\nSo POP is the Post Office Protocol.\n\n74\n00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.310\nIMAP, I always screw that one up.\n\n75\n00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.570\nInternet Message and something.\n\n76\n00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.490\n>> Message Access Protocol, that's right.\n\n77\n00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.350\n>> Thank you, Wes.\n\n78\n00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.690\nSo Internet Message Access Protocol,\nthose two are very,\n\n79\n00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.990\nvery standard connectivity methods for\na client to talk to a mail server.\n\n80\n00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.170\nAnd what would be your client.\n\n81\n00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.090\nWell, your client might be your iPhone,\nor your iPad.\n\n82\n00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.770\nOn an actual OS X machine\nyou've got the mail app.\n\n83\n00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.070\nSo you fire up your mail app,\nand it's gotta talk to a server.\n\n84\n00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.260\nSo you're gonna use either POP 3 or IMAP 4\nto talk to that server to get your email.\n\n85\n00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.580\nNow when you send email, you'll send email\nusing SMTP just like the servers do.\n\n86\n00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.470\nBut when you're checking and downloading\nemail, when you mark it as read,\n\n87\n00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.300\nwhen you create folders and all that good\nstuff, you'll use POP for your IMAP 4.\n\n88\n00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.646\nAnd that's what Dovecot provides.\n\n89\n00:04:51.646 --> 00:04:54.970\nSo, Postfix and\nDovecot are kind of the two\n\n90\n00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.750\nprimary components with Postfix being the\nmost important on your Mac mail server.\n\n91\n00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.865\nAfter that we got antivirus services,\nwhich are provide by ClamAV.\n\n92\n00:05:03.865 --> 00:05:07.300\nClamAV is another open source\nantivirus product that's out there.\n\n93\n00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.265\nAnd so the Mac mail server can scan\nevery single email that passes\n\n94\n00:05:10.265 --> 00:05:12.805\nthrough it to look for viruses,\nand it's all preconfigured.\n\n95\n00:05:12.805 --> 00:05:16.695\nAnd the last major component\nis SpamAssassin, and\n\n96\n00:05:16.695 --> 00:05:19.595\nlike its name indicates,\nit's what's scanning your email for spam.\n\n97\n00:05:19.595 --> 00:05:22.899\nAnd so filtering out spam messages so\nthey don't junk up your mailbox.\n\n98\n00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.167\nNow, those four components,\nthey're all open source, they're all free,\n\n99\n00:05:27.167 --> 00:05:28.843\nyou could go and download them right now.\n\n100\n00:05:28.843 --> 00:05:30.267\nSo you might be thinking,\n\n101\n00:05:30.267 --> 00:05:34.620\nboy that server app, it's $20,\nthat's not really a lot of money, right?\n\n102\n00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.452\nBut it's $20.\n\n103\n00:05:35.452 --> 00:05:37.883\nMaybe I'll just save the $20,\nand I'll go ahead and\n\n104\n00:05:37.883 --> 00:05:40.380\ninstall all these products yourself,\nright?\n\n105\n00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.600\nWell, you can do that.\n\n106\n00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.660\nI've done it.\n\n107\n00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.950\nIt takes a long time.\n\n108\n00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.540\nIt takes a lot of work, even if you\nknow exactly what you're doing,\n\n109\n00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.240\nit's gonna take you at least an hour to\nget those products downloaded, installed,\n\n110\n00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.160\nand a basic configuration put on them, and\n\n111\n00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.860\nthen all the configuration is done\nthrough text files, in the batch prop.\n\n112\n00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.320\nSo you gotta drop down to your terminal,\n\n113\n00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.540\nyou gotta go in there and\nconfigure them, it's very challenging.\n\n114\n00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.640\nIs it worth $20 to just not\nhave to deal with that?\n\n115\n00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.680\nAbsolutely.\n\n116\n00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.070\nSo the server app,\nwe flip a switch and it's on, and\n\n117\n00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.130\nall four of those products are installed,\nconfigured, and turned on, and now\n\n118\n00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.610\nwe have a nice little UI to manage it so\nthat's kinda the glory of the mail server.\n\n119\n00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.550\nSo you can quickly and\n\n120\n00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.840\neasily set up your own mail environment\nin just a manner of moments.\n\n121\n00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.770\n>> And Don, if you were doing this the\nmanual way like you're saying, going in\n\n122\n00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.400\nand configuring all the individual files,\nwouldn't you have to turn around and\n\n123\n00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.650\nthen manage each of those individual\ncomponents as ongoing maintenance as\n\n124\n00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.450\nfar as your mail server, versus\nusing something like the server app?\n\n125\n00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.700\n>> Yeah, yeah, you know like ClamAV and\nSpamAssasin, they get signature and\n\n126\n00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.200\ndefinition updates every day.\n\n127\n00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.510\nWe have to set that up to be\nable to get those updates.\n\n128\n00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.930\nAnd any time Postfix or Dovecot got\nan update, we'd have to push those out.\n\n129\n00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.980\nDovecot doesn't get updated all that much,\nbut Postfix does, and so\n\n130\n00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.200\nwe'd have to push updates.\n\n131\n00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.550\n>> So Don, if we do have all these\nsoftware as a service out there like\n\n132\n00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.040\nGmail, we've got a ton of them out there.\n\n133\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.600\nWhat would be some of the reasons that we\nwould even wanna run a mail server on our\n\n134\n00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.340\nnetworks, if we do have access to all\nthe solutions that really do it for us?\n\n135\n00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.610\n>> This is the point where,\nit'd be a really good segway for\n\n136\n00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.385\na Hilary Clinton joke, wouldn't it?\n\n137\n00:07:09.385 --> 00:07:12.630\n[LAUGH] If anybody could explain\nwhy we need our own mail server,\n\n138\n00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.400\nI think it would be her.\n\n139\n00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.630\nThere are various legitimate reasons\nwhy you might wanna set up your own\n\n140\n00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.220\nmail server.\n\n141\n00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.049\nAnd it doesn't matter what\npolitical party you're in.\n\n142\n00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.840\nJust the best example,\nmaybe you work for a hospital.\n\n143\n00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.935\nAnd here in the United States we have\nthis government regulation called HIPAA,\n\n144\n00:07:28.935 --> 00:07:30.120\nH-I-P-A-A.\n\n145\n00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.170\nAnd HIPAA is a set of compliance\nregulations that specify\n\n146\n00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.140\nhow patient data can be handled.\n\n147\n00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.290\nSo medical records are not allowed\nto be sent unencrypted, and so on.\n\n148\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.800\nWell, when you're leveraging\na third party mail service,\n\n149\n00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.220\nyou don't necessarily know\nhow that data's being stored.\n\n150\n00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.390\nYou don't know if it's safe,\nyou don't have that control.\n\n151\n00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.882\nSo if you need that control,\nyou need to set up your own mail server.\n\n152\n00:07:52.882 --> 00:07:57.094\nYou can set up your own mail service right\nhere and you have complete 100% control of\n\n153\n00:07:57.094 --> 00:08:01.015\nit, and you can dictate what emails\nare allowed to be sent, which ones aren't,\n\n154\n00:08:01.015 --> 00:08:03.107\nwhether encryption is enforced and so on.\n\n155\n00:08:03.107 --> 00:08:07.237\nYou have that control so\nIf you need complete control of your data,\n\n156\n00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:10.920\nrunning your own mail server\nis the solution, right?\n\n157\n00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.990\nThat's one reason.\n\n158\n00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.490\nAnother reason might be limited bandwidth,\nright?\n\n159\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.330\nIf the mail server is out there at a third\nparty, then they are out in the Internet.\n\n160\n00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.180\nAll of my clients are gonna\nhave to reach out to\n\n161\n00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.870\nthe Internet to access their mailbox.\n\n162\n00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.500\nSo if I have thousands upon thousands of\nusers all going out to the Internet to\n\n163\n00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.020\naccess their mailbox, I would need\nthe Internet bandwidth to handle that.\n\n164\n00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.800\nBut if the mail server was internal to my\nnetwork, it wouldn't hit the Internet.\n\n165\n00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.800\nIt'd all be hitting the internal server\nand so I could save on bandwidth.\n\n166\n00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.870\nSo that's another reason\nwhy we might do that.\n\n167\n00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:43.010\nSo control, security, bandwidth,\n\n168\n00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.630\nthose are all reasons why we might\nwant to set up our own mail server.\n\n169\n00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.440\nThe other thing can be cost, right?\n\n170\n00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.460\nIf you take a look at services like,\nGmail or iCloud even, iCloud is free.\n\n171\n00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.140\nYou can set up iCloud email account and\nit doesn't cost you a dime.\n\n172\n00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.380\nYou can set up a Gmail account and\nit doesn't cost you a dime.\n\n173\n00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.100\nBut they don't give you any\ncentralized management of it, right?\n\n174\n00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.920\nI can't turn on and off accounts because\neverybody set up their own account, right?\n\n175\n00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.780\nThey're all individual and separate.\n\n176\n00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:10.560\nSo if I want something that I can manage,\nwell with GMail it becomes Google Apps and\n\n177\n00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.708\nnow you've got to pay, right?\n\n178\n00:09:11.708 --> 00:09:15.880\nIt's like $6 per mailbox,\nper month, if I remember right.\n\n179\n00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.400\nSo that adds up.\n\n180\n00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.690\nIf you have thousands of users, that's\na pretty big check to write every month.\n\n181\n00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.450\nAnd with Apple, you can still use iCloud,\nbut you have to sign up for an MDM,\n\n182\n00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:27.420\na mobile device management service, a\nthird party that manages all that for you.\n\n183\n00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.580\nSo they can tie in all the Apple IDs,\n\n184\n00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.760\nand that is a pretty big check that you\nwrite every month versus setting up your\n\n185\n00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.460\nmail server where you pay $20 one time and\nthat's it.\n\n186\n00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.940\nAnd now you can build up\nyour own infrastructure.\n\n187\n00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.060\nNow there is a trade off.\n\n188\n00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.260\nBy running your own mail server, you\nare going to have to administrate them,\n\n189\n00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.690\nApple does make it easy, but if it\nbreaks you are going to have to fix it.\n\n190\n00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.500\nThose third party providers if something\nbreaks, they are going to have to fix it.\n\n191\n00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.380\nWith your server,\nyou've gotta back it up, right?\n\n192\n00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.530\nAll those emails are sitting\nright here in your server,\n\n193\n00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.300\nand if your server fails,\nyou lose that data.\n\n194\n00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.640\nSo services like Time Machine\nbecome really important.\n\n195\n00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.600\nWe need to have a good backup in that\nmail server, so if something goes wrong,\n\n196\n00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.130\nwe can restore.\n\n197\n00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.820\nSo, that's all really important, and\n\n198\n00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.230\njust things we need to consider\nwith running our mail server.\n\n199\n00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.640\n>> All right, Don.\nSo, I've got my server set up.\n\n200\n00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.290\nIt's in my basement,\n[LAUGH] and we're ready to go.\n\n201\n00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.210\nConfiguration, am I gonna pretty\nmuch just be configuring everything\n\n202\n00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:19.560\nthrough the server itself?\n\n203\n00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.680\n>> Pretty much, yeah.\n\n204\n00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.430\nThe process for getting mail server\nset up is pretty straightforward.\n\n205\n00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:24.620\nThere's only one part\nthat's a little tricky.\n\n206\n00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.060\nLet's just run through it real quick, so\nI'm in my server app here, so I've got\n\n207\n00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.770\nan OSX server and I'm using a different\nlab environment than the previous episode.\n\n208\n00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:33.370\nSo if you've been following along,\n\n209\n00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.190\nthis is a different server\nbecause I'm in Open Directory.\n\n210\n00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.940\nYou don't have to have\nan Open Directory for\n\n211\n00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.650\nyour mail server, but\nboy does it help, right.\n\n212\n00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.390\nIf you're gonna have centralized email\naccounts, having an Open Directory that\n\n213\n00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.810\nstores all those accounts\nwill make it much easier for\n\n214\n00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:49.660\nyou to have more than one server for\nredundancy and things like that.\n\n215\n00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.260\nSo typically we're gonna deploy the mail\nserver alongside an Open Directory.\n\n216\n00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.200\nSo I've already got an Open Directory\ncreated right here, and\n\n217\n00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.530\nI'm running DNS to be\nable to support that.\n\n218\n00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.540\nSo if you haven't learned about Open\nDirectory jump back to our Open Directory\n\n219\n00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.530\nepisode and we run through all of that.\n\n220\n00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.430\nBut the mail server itself,\nI can just click on Mail and you'll see,\n\n221\n00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.880\nwe do have some settings\nhere to mess with.\n\n222\n00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.190\nFor the most part,\n\n223\n00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.890\nthere's only two things we need to set\nto get this mail server up and running.\n\n224\n00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:17.880\nFirst you need to put the on switch right\nI forgot that in more than one episode so\n\n225\n00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.650\nI'm gonna do it first this time\nI'm just gonna turn it on.\n\n226\n00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.940\nAnd then the second thing\nis you have to tell it what\n\n227\n00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.300\nemail domains you're going to control.\n\n228\n00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.820\nSo when somebody sends to one of\nyour users what's their address?\n\n229\n00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.820\nIt's going to be some kind of name @ and\nyour domain.\n\n230\n00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.280\nSo let say that my domain is lab.itpro.tv,\nright.\n\n231\n00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.110\nSo I can come down here and\nI can go down to my Domains and\n\n232\n00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.410\nI can specify that domain.\n\n233\n00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.770\nSo I'm just gonna add to the list here and\nI'll come in and say, oops,\n\n234\n00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:51.370\nsorry I need to add the domain up here,\nlab.itpro.tv.\n\n235\n00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:55.210\nSo I'm gonna add that as my domain and\nI'll hit Create.\n\n236\n00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.630\nOkay, so it's gonna create\nthat domain on my mail server.\n\n237\n00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:04.720\nSo when an email comes in,\nif it's bob@lab.itpro.tv,\n\n238\n00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.300\nI know that's supposed to\ngo to this mail server.\n\n239\n00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:12.330\nIf it's going to bob@somethingelse.com,\n[LAUGH] then I know that's not for\n\n240\n00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.310\nme, and I need to relay it over to\nwhoever that is that it goes to, right?\n\n241\n00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:20.050\nSo that's how we tell what's an incoming\nemail versus an email that we're\n\n242\n00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.130\nforwarding along to another destination.\n\n243\n00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.050\nThat's why we've gotta define that, right.\n\n244\n00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:27.110\nThis is also where we attach\nemail addresses to our users.\n\n245\n00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:31.730\nSee how it says email address is zero and\nI need to add email addresses to my users?\n\n246\n00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:35.520\nSo if I go and edit that domain\nagain I can come in here and\n\n247\n00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:40.610\nI can add my users, and\nso I'm gonna add Wes.\n\n248\n00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:45.866\nSo there's old Wes, and then I'll add me.\n\n249\n00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:48.140\nI should be in that list, there we go.\n\n250\n00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.710\nAnd you'll see over here, it's taking\nmy Mac user name and making it,\n\n251\n00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:55.690\nso donpezet@lab.itpro.tv,\nor wesbryan@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n252\n00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.170\nI'm adding each of the users\nwho I want to have a mailbox.\n\n253\n00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:03.250\nSo I've turned on the mail server,\nI've added my domain, and\n\n254\n00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.170\nI've enabled a couple of users on it.\n\n255\n00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.320\nTechnically I'm done,\nthis is a mail server.\n\n256\n00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.960\nI could go to a client and set up a mail\napp to point to this server, and Wes and\n\n257\n00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.120\nI now have mailboxes.\n\n258\n00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.008\nAnd Wes and I could email each other and\n\n259\n00:13:16.008 --> 00:13:18.730\nwe could even email out to\nthe internet if we wanted to.\n\n260\n00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.290\nEverything would be fine.\n\n261\n00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.550\nSort of.\n\n262\n00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.540\nEverything I just said would work.\n\n263\n00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:28.260\nThe thing that I left out is, how can\nwe receive email from the Internet?\n\n264\n00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.045\nIf somebody's out there in internet land,\nand they want to send an email to\n\n265\n00:13:31.045 --> 00:13:34.800\nWes@lab.itpro.tv, if you\nwere to do that right now.\n\n266\n00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.030\nIt would fail.\n\n267\n00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:40.370\nAnd the reason is you don't\nknow how to get to our server.\n\n268\n00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.120\nAnd so, we have to tell you\nhow to get to our server.\n\n269\n00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.080\nAnd the way that's done\nis with a DNS record.\n\n270\n00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:51.360\nYou create DNS records that are called\nMX records, or mail exchange records.\n\n271\n00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.710\nSo, inside a DNS you\nnormally have A records.\n\n272\n00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.762\nThese are host records, a name to an IP.\n\n273\n00:13:55.762 --> 00:14:02.420\nAn MX record is different, MX record is a\ndomain name and it points to mail servers.\n\n274\n00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.370\nSo, it says if you're gonna send\nan email to anybody in this domain,\n\n275\n00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.160\nhere's the mail server you go to.\n\n276\n00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.520\nAnd so, these are really common.\n\n277\n00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.260\nLet me bring up a terminal\nreally quick and I'll show you.\n\n278\n00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.250\nIf I were to send an email to\nsomebody at AOL.com, right?\n\n279\n00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.226\nSo I'm gonna fire off\nan email to bob@aol.com.\n\n280\n00:14:18.226 --> 00:14:22.210\nWell, how do I know where\nAOL's mail servers are, right?\n\n281\n00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.350\nWell, I guess I get a time machine first\nand then I'll find them right, but\n\n282\n00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.100\nthey're still out there.\n\n283\n00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.290\nSo you can use the dig\ncommand in the terminal.\n\n284\n00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:33.310\nAnd the dig command will actually\nshow you somebody's mail servers.\n\n285\n00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:34.800\nBy default it does host records.\n\n286\n00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:40.010\nSo I need to do a dig with a -t MX,\nI'm telling you,\n\n287\n00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:44.830\ngonna do a DNS lookup, and I'm looking for\nfor MX records, not regular host records.\n\n288\n00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.876\nAnd I'm gonna lookup aol.com.\n\n289\n00:14:46.876 --> 00:14:51.010\nOkay, so if I were to send\nan email to aol.com, well,\n\n290\n00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.140\nthey've a couple of servers, don't they?\n\n291\n00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.070\nAOL has a ton of servers.\n\n292\n00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.120\nAll these servers pop up in the list.\n\n293\n00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.120\nSome of them are IPv4.\n\n294\n00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.695\nSome of them are IPv6.\n\n295\n00:14:59.695 --> 00:15:01.580\nThey're all out there.\n\n296\n00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.660\nIf I want to give an email to Bob@aol.com,\n\n297\n00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.220\nI can send it to any one of these\nservers and it will get to him, and\n\n298\n00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:10.060\nthat's cool because if one server fails,\nI can just move on to the next, and so on.\n\n299\n00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.000\nSo we've got some nice little\nredundancies set up here.\n\n300\n00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.380\nNow it isn't always like that.\n\n301\n00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.440\nWe don't always have redundancy.\n\n302\n00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:20.540\nSometimes you'll do an MX record lookup\nand somebody might only have one server.\n\n303\n00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.860\nThat does happen.\n\n304\n00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.180\nAnd if that one server goes down\nnow I can't send email to them.\n\n305\n00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:29.788\nWell, I my case I've only got one server,\nbut I need to create these name records.\n\n306\n00:15:29.788 --> 00:15:35.260\nOtherwise people aren't gonna be able to\nemail to me, if I were to do dig- t MX and\n\n307\n00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:40.370\nlook up lab.itpro.tv,\nwhen I look that up, what do I get?\n\n308\n00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:45.820\nWell I actually got a response, I got\na response from Amazon about a name server\n\n309\n00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:50.780\nright and it's for itpro.tv,\nnot lab.itpro.tv, right?\n\n310\n00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.610\nAnd that's because, what we have itpro.tv,\nthat's what our real email's like.\n\n311\n00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.337\nI'm don@itpro.tv,\nif you send me an email, I'll get it.\n\n312\n00:15:57.337 --> 00:16:01.807\nBut we don't for lab.itpro.tv.\n\n313\n00:16:01.807 --> 00:16:04.221\nAnd so notice right here under\nthe MX records, I've got nothing,\n\n314\n00:16:04.221 --> 00:16:05.479\nthere's no mail servers listed.\n\n315\n00:16:05.479 --> 00:16:12.504\nSo if I want the world to be able\nto email to me at Don@lab.ITPro.tv.\n\n316\n00:16:12.504 --> 00:16:15.569\nI would need to go to Amazon and\nadd that extra domain and\n\n317\n00:16:15.569 --> 00:16:18.640\nadd an MX record that\npointed to my server.\n\n318\n00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.220\nSo whoever your public DNS server is,\nthat's where you'd have to go and add it.\n\n319\n00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.060\nWell here, for the show,\nI'm just gonna use my internal DNS server.\n\n320\n00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:29.630\nNow Internals gonna make it work here in\nmy lab, but for you at home it won't work.\n\n321\n00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:30.830\nYou won't be able to resolve it.\n\n322\n00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.740\nSo we really want to do this on our public\nDNS server, it's the best place to do it.\n\n323\n00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.570\n>> Don,\nif you do set those public MX records,\n\n324\n00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:41.020\ncan you give us roughly an idea of\nhow long it would take to propagate?\n\n325\n00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:45.540\nSo now, all of a sudden,\nwe can send emails to lab.ITPro.Tv?\n\n326\n00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.550\n>> So it kind of depends.\n\n327\n00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:50.170\nIf you didn't have an MX record at all\nbefore, the change is almost immediate.\n\n328\n00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.057\nRight, cuz you never had one, so\npeople are constantly doing a look up, and\n\n329\n00:16:53.057 --> 00:16:55.430\nthe change will happen almost immediately.\n\n330\n00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:59.130\nIf you had a record before though and you\nare changing it, like maybe you had an MX\n\n331\n00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:04.180\nrecord that pointed to Microsoft's\noffice 365 and you're migrating\n\n332\n00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.370\nto your own mail service, so you change\nthe MX record to point to your own server.\n\n333\n00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:10.270\nWell, your MX records have\na time deliv on them.\n\n334\n00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.730\nAnd whatever that time deliv, is how long\nit can take for this to take effect.\n\n335\n00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:15.570\nSo like when I queried AOL.\n\n336\n00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:19.180\nIf I go back and look at AOL.\n\n337\n00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.410\nShoot.\nIt's kind of displaying it.\n\n338\n00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.499\nAnd it's displaying it in a way\nthat I can't really read.\n\n339\n00:17:23.499 --> 00:17:26.620\nBut this number right here,\nis kind of our time deliv.\n\n340\n00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:30.900\nAnd it's laying that out, actually I guess\nright here is the main one that I care\n\n341\n00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.450\nabout and\nthese are just set to five minutes.\n\n342\n00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.990\nSo these are all set to just five minutes,\nso within five minutes\n\n343\n00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.980\neverybody will refresh and get the new\none, but yours may be set differently.\n\n344\n00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.070\nYou always have that time\ndeliv to worry about.\n\n345\n00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:44.190\nSo when I go to setup my server,\nI just need to be aware of that.\n\n346\n00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:45.370\nThere may be a time delay, and\n\n347\n00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.740\nsometimes it'll tell you it\ncould take up to 48 hours.\n\n348\n00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.600\nWell, nobody has a 48 hour time deliv on\ntheirs, but you could, in theory, have.\n\n349\n00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.580\nI think 72 hours is the maximum,\nbut you could go higher.\n\n350\n00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:58.120\n>> Now, you let us know that multiple\nMX records provide redundancy.\n\n351\n00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.050\nIs there any other benefit to\nhaving more than one public MX\n\n352\n00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.670\nrecord other than just redundancy?\n\n353\n00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:03.810\n>> It's usually just redundancy.\n\n354\n00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.340\nI mean, you could set priorities on them.\n\n355\n00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.186\nSo that one gets preferred over the other,\nand so\n\n356\n00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:09.406\nmaybe have one at the back-up center and\none at your main.\n\n357\n00:18:09.406 --> 00:18:13.035\nSo they might not both be running at\nthe same time, that would be more,\n\n358\n00:18:13.035 --> 00:18:14.150\nI guess redundancy.\n\n359\n00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:19.020\nIf they all have the same priority,\nthen you'd load balance across them,\n\n360\n00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.060\nso you'd get a little\nmore resources out of it.\n\n361\n00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.130\nAll right well I'm just gonna\ngo into my DNS server here and\n\n362\n00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.100\nI'm going to add an MX record for\nmy system.\n\n363\n00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:31.120\nNow normally when you go in here and\nadd records it's adding a records, a name\n\n364\n00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:36.340\nto an IP, which I've already got one for\nmy server, but I need to add an MX record.\n\n365\n00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.000\nSo if I were to just hit the little\nplus sign here see how it's gonna\n\n366\n00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.210\ndo a host name or a whatever, but\n\n367\n00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:46.010\nit's got right down here,\ncreate an MX record for this host name.\n\n368\n00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:49.870\nAnd so I can come in and\npunch in lab.itpro.tv and\n\n369\n00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.620\ndown here, I can choose to\ncreate an MX record for it, so\n\n370\n00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.810\nthat it'll know that I need to\nhave that MX record, right?\n\n371\n00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:02.490\nAnd when I come in and punch this one in,\nwell actually, you know what,\n\n372\n00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.670\nsince I've already got one I can probably\njust edit the one I've already got,\n\n373\n00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:05.470\nlet me go that route.\n\n374\n00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:07.590\nSo if I edit this one, there we go.\n\n375\n00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.280\nSo this is my server that\nI've already got in place.\n\n376\n00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.650\nAnd I can just check that box to say hey,\nthis is gonna be a mail server also.\n\n377\n00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.560\nAnd so now when I say OK to that,\nit's gonna create the extra record.\n\n378\n00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.140\nNow, visually I'm not gonna see that.\n\n379\n00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.330\nUnless I hit the gear and\nchoose Show All Records.\n\n380\n00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.950\nAnd now it's gonna show me everything and\nI can expand that out.\n\n381\n00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:33.360\nAnd see how I've got an A Record for\nserver01, and I've got an MX Record?\n\n382\n00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.180\nSo now when somebody goes to send\nme an email, if I come in here and\n\n383\n00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:39.850\ndo that dig again, now I get an answer.\n\n384\n00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:45.180\nThere's lab.itpro.tv as an metric and\npeople will be able to find me right.\n\n385\n00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.860\nThat's really the hardest part is setting\nup your own mail server is getting that\n\n386\n00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:48.730\nput in place.\n\n387\n00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.440\nAfter that the mail server's up and\nrunning.\n\n388\n00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.000\nIt's done.\n\n389\n00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:56.240\nLet's go over some of the other\nsettings through just to be complete.\n\n390\n00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:01.400\nSo back on my mail settings here,\nthere were a lot of different options.\n\n391\n00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.600\nAnd some of the ones that we're used to,\nright, like permissions.\n\n392\n00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.000\nWho's allowed to connect\nto the mail server?\n\n393\n00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.430\nThe default is everybody but\nyou might wanna tweak and change that.\n\n394\n00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.450\nThen we've got authentication.\n\n395\n00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:12.660\nWhen people connect to the mail server,\nthey've gotta authenticate.\n\n396\n00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.360\nSo what methods do I support?\n\n397\n00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.933\nIf you edit that you'll see\nit's set to automatic, but\n\n398\n00:20:17.933 --> 00:20:21.328\nyou can force it to use open directory or\nlocal or even a Microsoft activity\n\n399\n00:20:21.328 --> 00:20:24.531\ndirectory, so you can kind of pick and\nchoose how you want that to go.\n\n400\n00:20:24.531 --> 00:20:25.890\nI am going to leave mine automatic.\n\n401\n00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.652\nI only have an open directory, so\nthat's really all I've have got.\n\n402\n00:20:28.652 --> 00:20:29.640\nSo it'll support that,\n\n403\n00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.189\nbut it'll also support local\naccounts to if I want that route.\n\n404\n00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.430\nAll right.\nThen we've got push notifications,\n\n405\n00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:36.790\nand push notifications.\n\n406\n00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:39.970\nThey don't actually do anything for\nan OS ten client, but\n\n407\n00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.560\nif you have an iPhone or an iPad.\n\n408\n00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.405\nPush notifications come in really handy.\n\n409\n00:20:44.405 --> 00:20:49.035\nIn the olden days, [LAUGH] if you set up\na mail account on your iPhone or iPad,\n\n410\n00:20:49.035 --> 00:20:54.273\nit would have to reach out every 5 minutes\nor every 15 minutes to check your email.\n\n411\n00:20:54.273 --> 00:20:55.350\nAnd that's what it would do.\n\n412\n00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.280\nIt's just constantly reaching\nout every couple of minutes.\n\n413\n00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.540\nWell, it affects your battery life.\n\n414\n00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.570\nThe more frequently it checks, it's gotta\nkeep the phone awake to do that and\n\n415\n00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:03.900\nit starts to eat up battery.\n\n416\n00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.820\nSo you'd wanna set a longer time so\nthat you'd save battery.\n\n417\n00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.690\nBut the longer time you set,\nthe longer it was before you get an email.\n\n418\n00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:11.980\nSomebody would send you an email and\n\n419\n00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.020\nyou wouldn't necessarily get it for 15\nminutes cuz your phone wasn't checking in.\n\n420\n00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:19.130\nWhat Push Notifications do is instead\nof the phone having to reach out to\n\n421\n00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:22.720\nthe servers every so often, the phones\ncan just listen, they just wait.\n\n422\n00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.130\nAnd the servers will reach out to them and\nlet them know, hey, you got a new email.\n\n423\n00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.010\nAnd that way we get that notification.\n\n424\n00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.790\nSo not as important on a desktop.\n\n425\n00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.260\nVery important on mobile devices.\n\n426\n00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.360\nSo you can turn that on if you want.\n\n427\n00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.940\nThen we've got the filtering\nside of things.\n\n428\n00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.360\nRemember I mentioned ClamAV and\nSpamAssassin?\n\n429\n00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.580\nWell, here's where we can\nturn those on and off, and\n\n430\n00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.850\nnormally that means we've gotta jump down\nto some text files and start to do this\n\n431\n00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.410\nhuge complex configuration, but\nhere I just hit filter settings.\n\n432\n00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:52.230\nAnd now I can tweak it.\n\n433\n00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:54.540\nThe virus filtering doesn't really\nhave a whole lot of options here.\n\n434\n00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.005\nYou just turn it on or off.\n\n435\n00:21:56.005 --> 00:21:58.110\nIt's going to scan every email and\n\n436\n00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:02.350\nif it finds an email that's infected\nthen it will quarantine it.\n\n437\n00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:03.750\nEverything else will pass through.\n\n438\n00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:06.790\nSo you can turn plan maybe on or off.\n\n439\n00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.070\nThen we've got blacklist filtering.\n\n440\n00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.850\nWhat is that?\n\n441\n00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.780\nWell, there's a number of\ndifferent companies around\n\n442\n00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.648\nthe world that offer spam\nblacklists where they try and\n\n443\n00:22:15.648 --> 00:22:20.250\ndocument all of the IP addresses out there\nin the Internet that are relaying spam.\n\n444\n00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:21.350\nThese are mail servers.\n\n445\n00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:25.680\nThey're trying to identify mail servers on\nthe Internet that are transmitting spam.\n\n446\n00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.490\nAnd you can block connections\nto those servers.\n\n447\n00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.070\nAnd you do it by attaching\nto one of their blacklists.\n\n448\n00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.890\nNow, on a positive side you can stop spam\n\n449\n00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.350\nbefore it even gets to\nyour server by doing this.\n\n450\n00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:41.060\nOn a negative side, these guys have\nvery high false positive rates, and\n\n451\n00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.180\nso it's kind of a trade off.\n\n452\n00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:49.840\nDo you want less spam, but\nyou block a lot of good email too,\n\n453\n00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:54.670\nor you want the risk of more spam and\nyou don't block email by accident.\n\n454\n00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:59.260\nIf you're a business where you make money\nvia email, you don't want false positives\n\n455\n00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.000\nand so this doesn't work out so\nwell, that's why it's off by default.\n\n456\n00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.180\nBut if this is your own personal email or\nsomething then you may want to turn this\n\n457\n00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.419\non and it'll signficantly reduce\nthe amount of spam that you get.\n\n458\n00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:10.650\nThen we've got greylist filtering.\n\n459\n00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:11.490\nAll right.\n\n460\n00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.370\nGreylist filtering is a tough one.\n\n461\n00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:15.480\nIt's turn off my default and\n\n462\n00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.410\nyou'll see that it temporarily\nrejects mail from unknown senders.\n\n463\n00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.940\nAfter a delay a legitimate\nsender will retry.\n\n464\n00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.980\nAll right, what happens is spam servers,\n\n465\n00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:30.340\nwhen they shoot out spam, they just\ntry and fire out as much as they can.\n\n466\n00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.029\nMillions of emails per\nhour as fast as they can.\n\n467\n00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:36.250\nAnd if a server rejects them,\nthey just give up.\n\n468\n00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:37.130\nThey don't retry.\n\n469\n00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.390\nThey just move on to the next server.\n\n470\n00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:44.870\nBut if this were a legitimate email,\nlegitimate mail servers will try\n\n471\n00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:49.390\nonce every 30 seconds for three tries.\n\n472\n00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:53.770\nAnd then they'll try once every, if I\nremember right it's every five minutes for\n\n473\n00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:54.950\nthree tries.\n\n474\n00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:57.115\nAnd then it goes up to every six hours for\nthree tries.\n\n475\n00:23:57.115 --> 00:23:59.832\nAnd then two more tries at 24 hours.\n\n476\n00:23:59.832 --> 00:24:03.466\nSo you end up at basically a 72 hour\nwindow of attempts that a legitimate\n\n477\n00:24:03.466 --> 00:24:04.428\nserver will make.\n\n478\n00:24:04.428 --> 00:24:07.735\nAnd you might have seen these emails that\nyou get every now and then that say,\n\n479\n00:24:07.735 --> 00:24:10.640\nmessage delivery has been delayed,\nblah, blah, blah, right?\n\n480\n00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.680\nThat's waiting on that\nemail server to respond.\n\n481\n00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.610\n>> Now Don, is that a way for\nthe legitimate mail server there to try to\n\n482\n00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:21.410\nkeep itself off of those DNS\nblacklists that you're talking about?\n\n483\n00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:25.540\nIs that the purpose for\nthe retry and staggered retry?\n\n484\n00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.820\n>> No, it's really redundancy.\n\n485\n00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.640\nIf my mail server goes down,\nmaybe I just need to reboot it, right?\n\n486\n00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.290\nWhat happens if an email's\ncoming in while I reboot?\n\n487\n00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.150\nThe email's gone, I lost it.\n\n488\n00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:38.700\nUnless, the sender retries and\nnow the server comes back online and\n\n489\n00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:39.560\nit comes in, so.\n\n490\n00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.780\nIf I ever have an email server fail, as\nlong as I can get it back up within say,\n\n491\n00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.730\n48 hours, I probably won't lose any email.\n\n492\n00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:50.210\nThat as long as I get it back up in 48\nhours, everybody else would just continue\n\n493\n00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:53.150\nto retry and then those emails will\ntrickle in as soon as the server comes\n\n494\n00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:55.480\nback up, that's kind of what\nthe purpose is of that.\n\n495\n00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:01.010\nHere, this is a tricky way of using it\nto get around finding spam servers.\n\n496\n00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:05.240\nNow, this is frowned upon by a lot\nof people because what it does\n\n497\n00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.800\nis it makes all the legitimate\nservers have to email to you twice.\n\n498\n00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.730\nThey try and send to you once and\nyou reject, and then they retry and\n\n499\n00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:13.570\nsend you again.\n\n500\n00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.320\nSo you're actually\nincreasing the workload for\n\n501\n00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.830\nthose other servers in exchange for\nyou getting less spam.\n\n502\n00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:22.610\nAnd so that's not really fair to\nthe other people that are out there, and\n\n503\n00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:24.110\nthat's why this one is off.\n\n504\n00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:28.230\nYou can turn it on if you want,\nbut that's the way that one works.\n\n505\n00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.570\nThen we got junk mail filtering.\n\n506\n00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.770\nThis is the spam assassin.\n\n507\n00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.420\nAnd with spam assassin, you can tweak it.\n\n508\n00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.410\nIt's got all sorts of\nhighly customizable files.\n\n509\n00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.450\nBut at the end of the day,\nwhat most people need is this right here,\n\n510\n00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:44.510\nit's just a slider that indicates whether\nwe want it to be aggressive or cautious.\n\n511\n00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:49.190\nAggressive will get you less spam but\nmore false positives.\n\n512\n00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:53.430\nCautious will get you more spam but\nless false positives.\n\n513\n00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:55.640\nAnd you've gotta find that happy medium.\n\n514\n00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.080\nAnd I know what you're thinking,\nwell, Don,\n\n515\n00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.880\nthe happy medium's right here,\nit's labeled moderate.\n\n516\n00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:04.530\nBut if you go that route, honestly you'll\nfind that you get a lot of spam, that\n\n517\n00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:08.650\nthe thresholds are just kinda set where\nyou never really wanna go beneath that.\n\n518\n00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:11.970\nSee how it says, minimum score for\njunk mail 6 points.\n\n519\n00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:16.800\nEvery time an email comes in,\nit runs this score card against the email.\n\n520\n00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.730\nAre the letters in all capitals?\n\n521\n00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:20.330\nThat counts for one.\n\n522\n00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.380\nIs there the word unsubscribe?\n\n523\n00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.000\nThat counts for one.\n\n524\n00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.025\nIs it from an email\naddress who's MX record\n\n525\n00:26:29.025 --> 00:26:32.945\nis tied to a different IP then what we\njust received it on, that counts for one.\n\n526\n00:26:32.945 --> 00:26:33.915\nEach of these things count for\n\n527\n00:26:33.915 --> 00:26:38.575\npoints, these are standard things\nthat indicate a spam message.\n\n528\n00:26:38.575 --> 00:26:41.680\nIs the entire email message an image?\n\n529\n00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.090\nThat counts for one.\n\n530\n00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:45.880\nAnd if it adds up to 6, that's spam.\n\n531\n00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.130\nIf it adds up to 6 or higher, it's spam.\n\n532\n00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:51.980\nAs we adjust this slider,\nyou'll see the number goes up.\n\n533\n00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:55.570\nSo now its gotta add up\nto 16 to count as spam.\n\n534\n00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:59.060\nSo it might have several red flags but\nnot enough to get all the way to 16.\n\n535\n00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:02.500\nIf I go aggressive, 0 points.\n\n536\n00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:07.360\nIf I even remotely think that it might be\nspam, it's going in the spam folder and\n\n537\n00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.240\nyou'll find that's way to aggressive.\n\n538\n00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.280\nEven one point can be too aggressive.\n\n539\n00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.540\nBecause if somebody has a word in there\nthat's in all capitals that can throw off,\n\n540\n00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.740\nthere's this ratio that it measures\ncapital letters to lowercase and\n\n541\n00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.540\nso on, that if it throws\nthat off it'll become spam.\n\n542\n00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.290\nSo you've gotta find what works for\nyou and\n\n543\n00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:25.490\nyou'll find that tip if you have to come\nin and tweak this value to get it right.\n\n544\n00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.030\nOkay, so that was kind of filtering.\n\n545\n00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:31.310\nLastly we've got, well,\nI guess we have two more options,\n\n546\n00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:33.750\nso next we've got the Mail Relay.\n\n547\n00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:35.235\nMail Relay is an interesting one.\n\n548\n00:27:35.235 --> 00:27:39.230\n[COUGH] When your email server\ngoes to send outgoing email,\n\n549\n00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:43.590\nby default it'll look up the MX record and\nit'll reach directly out to that server.\n\n550\n00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:47.010\nSo if it has an email to bob@aol.com,\nit's gonna try and\n\n551\n00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:48.970\nconnect to AOL's email servers.\n\n552\n00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:53.510\nAnd if it has an email to jane@icloud.com,\nit's gonna look up the MX records for\n\n553\n00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.350\niCloud and it's gonna go and\nconnect to them.\n\n554\n00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:58.290\nSo your server is reaching out\nto all these different servers\n\n555\n00:27:58.290 --> 00:27:59.940\non the Internet, all right?\n\n556\n00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.630\nWell, that can create a lot\nof load on the server.\n\n557\n00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:06.030\nSo instead,\nyou might wanna setup a dedicated server\n\n558\n00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:09.595\nthat does those connections, or\nyour ISP might provide it for you.\n\n559\n00:28:09.595 --> 00:28:13.335\nA lot of ISPs provide this, they provide\nwhat's called a mail bagging service.\n\n560\n00:28:13.335 --> 00:28:17.475\nWhere all your incoming email and all your\noutgoing email is relayed through them.\n\n561\n00:28:17.475 --> 00:28:19.965\nAnd so if you want to do that,\nyou can turn that option right here,\n\n562\n00:28:19.965 --> 00:28:23.980\nRelay outgoing email through an ISP,\nand you go into the Relay Options, and\n\n563\n00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:28.390\nyou can tell it the IP address of the\nsystem that you're going to relay through.\n\n564\n00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:31.460\nNow normally, they authenticate based on\nIPs so you don't need authentication.\n\n565\n00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.230\nBut if you do, you can turn that on and\nyou can provide the credentials.\n\n566\n00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:37.900\nAnd now, your outbound email will\nall be sent to this one IP and\n\n567\n00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:41.170\nit will be up to that system to\nrelay it wherever it needs to go.\n\n568\n00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.590\nNot everybody has that.\n\n569\n00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:45.970\nThe big advantage of mail bagging like\nthis is if your server goes down,\n\n570\n00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:47.160\nthey collect all the email.\n\n571\n00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.780\nAnd now you can be down more than 72 hours\nbut all your email is safely collected\n\n572\n00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.990\nright there and you can get it as\nsoon as your system is back online.\n\n573\n00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:57.141\nThis used to be a popular thing,\nit's not very popular anymore at all.\n\n574\n00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.200\nAll right, the last setting that we've\ngot here is the Mailbox Size limit.\n\n575\n00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.050\nPeople use email weird ways, right?\n\n576\n00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:08.050\nEmail is really just supposed to\nbe used to send text messages.\n\n577\n00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.450\nAnd those messages are very small.\n\n578\n00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:13.030\nYour typical email is less than\none kilobyte in size, right?\n\n579\n00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.480\nIf you're just writing text,\n\n580\n00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.830\nthe example I always give is\nthe Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\n581\n00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.230\nIf you were to take the encyclo,\n\n582\n00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:22.760\nwell, I don't know, some of our viewers\nmight not remember encyclopedias.\n\n583\n00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.960\nSo if you were to take the Encyclopedia\nBritannica, it's a series of books, and\n\n584\n00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.520\nall these books, if you were to take\nall 26 volumes of that encyclopedia and\n\n585\n00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.690\njust take the text and\n\n586\n00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:36.379\nput it in an email, it would add up\nto about one and half megabytes.\n\n587\n00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.490\nThat's basically what it would add up to,\none and a half megabytes.\n\n588\n00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:43.030\nAnd is one and\na half megabytes a lot of storage?\n\n589\n00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:43.680\nAbsolutely not.\n\n590\n00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.620\nIt's a drop in a bucket.\n\n591\n00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:48.120\nIn fact, most mail servers limit\nemail to about 10 megabytes.\n\n592\n00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:52.070\nSo you can have several copies in the\nEncyclopedia Britannica right there in one\n\n593\n00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.870\nemail, right?\n\n594\n00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:57.630\nBut when you throw pictures into\nthe mix all of a sudden that changes.\n\n595\n00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:58.530\nBinary files.\n\n596\n00:29:58.530 --> 00:29:59.980\nBinary files are big.\n\n597\n00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:03.990\nIt's not uncommon for a picture,\neven a low quality picture these days is 5\n\n598\n00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:07.970\nmegs but they'll oftentimes be 50 or\n60 megs just for a single picture,\n\n599\n00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:11.380\nif they'd been done in HD and high-quality\nbitrate and all that good stuff.\n\n600\n00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.170\nSo files can get big.\n\n601\n00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:17.100\nWell, email wasn't intended to be used for\nfile transfers.\n\n602\n00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.120\nBut people use it that way.\n\n603\n00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.080\nPeople use attachments all the time.\n\n604\n00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.420\nHey Wes, can you send me that PDF\nwe were talking about yesterday?\n\n605\n00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.520\nWell, you could go to Dropbox,\nand generate a link and\n\n606\n00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.390\nsend it to me, or you could put it\non a file server, and I can go and\n\n607\n00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:33.260\nconnect to it, or you could just attach\nit to an email and send it to me, right?\n\n608\n00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.530\nAnd that's what people do.\n\n609\n00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:38.240\nAnd as a result, your mailboxes grow\nbigger, and bigger, and bigger.\n\n610\n00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.880\nAll right.\nNow, what's wrong with that?\n\n611\n00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.851\nYou could just say, fine,\nI'm okay with that.\n\n612\n00:30:41.851 --> 00:30:43.749\nLet the mailboxes grow big,\nwhat do I care?\n\n613\n00:30:43.749 --> 00:30:49.220\nWell, the bigger the mailboxes get, the\nlonger it takes for you to back them up.\n\n614\n00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:53.860\nAnd If there's ever a failure,\nthe longer it'll take you to restore them.\n\n615\n00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:58.520\nKeeping your mail server database small,\nmakes it easy to backup, easy to restore.\n\n616\n00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:03.300\nSo when a failure occurs, you can react\nvery quickly and minimize your downtime.\n\n617\n00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.650\nThe bigger your mailbox database, the\nharder it is to minimize that downtime.\n\n618\n00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:07.720\nSo that's the risk we take.\n\n619\n00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.560\nSo you could just say, forget it,\nyou have a mailbox as big as you want.\n\n620\n00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.840\nBut understand that's the trade off,\nthe trade off is recovery time, right?\n\n621\n00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.800\nAnd just general maintenance.\n\n622\n00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.180\nEventually your hard drive fills up,\n\n623\n00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.670\nyour mailbox database starts to\nget slower because it's so big.\n\n624\n00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:22.160\nThose are all things that\ncan kind of lead to that.\n\n625\n00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:26.680\nAll right, so we can limit that mailbox\nsize and you can be really aggressive on\n\n626\n00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:31.090\nthis or you can be nice and just say, hey,\nI want everybody to be limited to 2 gigs.\n\n627\n00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:32.780\nRight?\nSo I'll put in 2000 megabytes,\n\n628\n00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.940\nthat's a pretty decent sized mailbox.\n\n629\n00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.640\nI know when GMail started they\nlimited everybody to 10 gigs.\n\n630\n00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.340\nI think they're, I don't know if they're\nunlimited now but it's really big.\n\n631\n00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:43.510\nSo you can set something like that but\nthis will just make sure that I can\n\n632\n00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:45.945\nunderstand the maximum size\nin my mailbox database.\n\n633\n00:31:47.715 --> 00:31:50.645\nAll right, once that's setup,\nwe're done, right?\n\n634\n00:31:50.645 --> 00:31:54.085\nThat's our mail server, we're all\nconfigured, everything's in business.\n\n635\n00:31:54.085 --> 00:31:54.900\nWe're now up and running, okay?\n\n636\n00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.920\nNow there's not a lot of activity going\non in this mail server, but it is running\n\n637\n00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:03.008\nthe database, and it is ready to receive\nemail, ready to check and handle data.\n\n638\n00:32:03.008 --> 00:32:07.060\nDon I've noticed sometimes in using\neven the Cloud base services, or\n\n639\n00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:10.493\nmaybe even on a network where\nthey have an exchange server,\n\n640\n00:32:10.493 --> 00:32:15.232\nspeaking of those attachments, as an email\nadministrator, I'm sure you love,\n\n641\n00:32:15.232 --> 00:32:19.240\nwhere it bounces back because the email,\nthe attachment is too big.\n\n642\n00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.030\nIs that something that we can control\ninside of the mail server here?\n\n643\n00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:26.490\n>> Not via the GUI, so you can drop to the\ncommand line and tweak the configurations\n\n644\n00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:29.580\nand you can adjust the maximum the mail\nsize there, but via the GUI you can't.\n\n645\n00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.030\nSo they don't get us a way for that.\n\n646\n00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:34.650\nIt is somewhat simplified here\nas far as the options in it.\n\n647\n00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:37.510\nYou really see that with Spam Assassin\nwhere all you had is that slider.\n\n648\n00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:40.500\nI'll tell you guys that Spam Assassin\nis infinitely configurable.\n\n649\n00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.790\nBut, we don't see that here,\nit's been simplified.\n\n650\n00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.100\nAnd, just for your own reference,\nlet me draw up to a terminal real quick.\n\n651\n00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.770\nI wanna show you guys where all\nthis stuff is being stored, right?\n\n652\n00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.530\nSo, all of this is just running\n\n653\n00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:54.450\nin the same way that it would\non a standard Unix or Linux box.\n\n654\n00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:59.990\nIf I browse into /Library/Server/Mail,\n\n655\n00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:02.920\ninside of there you'll see Config and\nData.\n\n656\n00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:08.262\nAnd in the config folder is where we\nhave post figs, clamav, spam assassin.\n\n657\n00:33:08.262 --> 00:33:10.210\nAll right,\nyou see their folders right there and\n\n658\n00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:12.390\nall of their associated\nconfiguration files.\n\n659\n00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.700\nSo like Wes mentioned\nthe maximum mail size.\n\n660\n00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.580\nWell, I would jump in to\nthe post figs folder and\n\n661\n00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.585\ngo in to the configuration files for\npost figs.\n\n662\n00:33:19.585 --> 00:33:21.974\nMain.CF has the bulk of it right there.\n\n663\n00:33:21.974 --> 00:33:24.333\nAnd so I would jump in there and\nhunt down that option for\n\n664\n00:33:24.333 --> 00:33:25.990\nthe maximum mail size and set it.\n\n665\n00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:27.540\nI'll need to restart the mail server\n\n666\n00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.980\nbefore that takes effect but\nyou can do it.\n\n667\n00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:32.140\nSo those are our options you might have\nto customize from the command line.\n\n668\n00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.313\nOtherwise you really don't\nneed to come here very often,\n\n669\n00:33:35.313 --> 00:33:39.647\nif you ever want to see how big your mail\ndatabase is, all of the email is stored,\n\n670\n00:33:39.647 --> 00:33:41.347\nlet's see what folder am I in.\n\n671\n00:33:41.347 --> 00:33:49.576\nLet me get back up here to\nthe data folder, whoops.\n\n672\n00:33:49.576 --> 00:33:52.775\nLet me get in the right folder,\nthere we go.\n\n673\n00:33:52.775 --> 00:33:57.125\n/Library/server/mail and\nI'm gonna get into the Data folder.\n\n674\n00:33:57.125 --> 00:34:01.105\nAnd in the Data folder is where you'll\nstart to find your mailbox database.\n\n675\n00:34:01.105 --> 00:34:02.395\nNow there's other stuff in here but\n\n676\n00:34:02.395 --> 00:34:06.902\nthis right here is where our mailbox\ndatabase is stored, that mail folder.\n\n677\n00:34:06.902 --> 00:34:10.663\nAnd if I go into the mail folder I'm\ngonna see that little shared folder for\n\n678\n00:34:10.663 --> 00:34:13.707\nDovecot and I actually don't\nsee my mailbox database yet.\n\n679\n00:34:13.707 --> 00:34:16.182\nAnd that's because we haven't\nprocessed a single email.\n\n680\n00:34:16.182 --> 00:34:17.612\nBut as soon as we process an email,\n\n681\n00:34:17.612 --> 00:34:20.472\nas soon as we get a client connected,\nthe mailbox database will appear.\n\n682\n00:34:20.472 --> 00:34:23.172\nAnd we'll start to see our data,\nand that'll start to\n\n683\n00:34:23.172 --> 00:34:27.222\ngrow as information gets put in there,\nso you can kinda track how big that is.\n\n684\n00:34:27.222 --> 00:34:32.480\nIncoming and outgoing email is being\nprocessed goes in the Spool folder,\n\n685\n00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:38.030\nso I'm in /Library/Server/Mail/Data/Spool.\n\n686\n00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:42.670\nAnd if you look in there, here's where\nyour incoming email, your bounced email,\n\n687\n00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:45.880\nmail that's dropped,\nall those things are going right here\n\n688\n00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:49.190\nwhile it's handling them before\nputting them into our mailbox.\n\n689\n00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:54.900\nAnd the last one that's important\nto us is the virus quarantine.\n\n690\n00:34:54.900 --> 00:35:00.166\nIf something gets quarantined, it ends\nup in the data folder in the scanner\n\n691\n00:35:00.166 --> 00:35:05.098\nfolder and if we go into scanner there\nis another folder in there called\n\n692\n00:35:05.098 --> 00:35:09.845\nvirusmail which might not exist yet\nit doesn't exist yet for me.\n\n693\n00:35:09.845 --> 00:35:14.085\nNo it's virusmail with an s that\nwill make a difference there we go.\n\n694\n00:35:14.085 --> 00:35:18.080\nSo that virusmail's folder that's\nwhere it get quarantined email goes.\n\n695\n00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.140\nSo if it finds a virus it sticks it there\nand then after a while it deletes it.\n\n696\n00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.240\nNow, I got permission\ndenied because it's secure.\n\n697\n00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.990\nThey don't want just any old user browsing\ninto that folder cuz this is where\n\n698\n00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.640\nthe infected emails are.\n\n699\n00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:33.760\nBut we could always do a sudo and pull\nup what's in there, it should be empty.\n\n700\n00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.970\nSo let me just get it and,\nyeah, so it's empty.\n\n701\n00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:39.850\nI haven't received any infected email but\nif I had they'd be right there.\n\n702\n00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:43.600\nThey'd be eml files that you could\nread if If it was actually safe,\n\n703\n00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.200\nyou could pull the data out of there.\n\n704\n00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.070\nOdds are if it makes it into that\nfolder though it's not safe and\n\n705\n00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:50.560\nyou may want to flush it out every now and\nthen on your own, or you can just wait and\n\n706\n00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.320\nthe system will flush it out for you.\n\n707\n00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:56.216\n>> Don, great information on\ngetting the server side app setup.\n\n708\n00:35:56.216 --> 00:35:59.224\nNow I know, we don't have any\ninformation in that database yet,\n\n709\n00:35:59.224 --> 00:36:01.040\nbecause we don't have a client setup.\n\n710\n00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.390\nAnd you're going to show us that, so\na lot more good information on that, but\n\n711\n00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:06.990\nlooking at the clock here, it does look\nlike we're coming to the end of another\n\n712\n00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:09.970\nepisode, but before we sign out,\ndo you got any additional information?\n\n713\n00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:12.698\n>> Yeah, we'll do a part two because\nwe need to show the client side,\n\n714\n00:36:12.698 --> 00:36:14.161\nget an email client connected, and\n\n715\n00:36:14.161 --> 00:36:17.158\nshow some email actually moving\nbecause that's kinda the whole point.\n\n716\n00:36:17.158 --> 00:36:20.320\nJust be aware that setting a mail server\nis really easy It does require some\n\n717\n00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.340\nmaintenance, right?\n\n718\n00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:24.340\nWe need to make sure we are doing those\nbackups, that's really important.\n\n719\n00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:28.330\nAnd then make sure your MX records\nare configured properly otherwise\n\n720\n00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:29.300\nemail is not gonna come in.\n\n721\n00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.430\nYour outgoing email will work fine,\nbut your incoming won't.\n\n722\n00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:33.270\nSo definitely be aware of that.\n\n723\n00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:36.090\n>> Well Don, we appreciate your wealth of\nknowledge on that, and we appreciate you,\n\n724\n00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:36.940\nthe viewer, for watching.\n\n725\n00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:40.480\nWe are gonna go ahead and sign off for\nITProTV, I have been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n726\n00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.057\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n727\n00:36:41.057 --> 00:36:43.241\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n728\n00:36:43.241 --> 00:36:50.930\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.670\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.115\nwe're continuing through our\nseries on OSX Server essentials.\n\n5\n00:00:21.115 --> 00:00:23.785\nSpecifically, we're looking\nat collaborative services and\n\n6\n00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:27.400\nwe're coming back with a part two,\nthat's right, mail server the sequel.\n\n7\n00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.740\nJoining me in the studios today,\nis none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.020\nDon, how are you doing to day, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.664\n>> Doing great Wes, ready to wrap\nup our mail server conversation.\n\n10\n00:00:33.664 --> 00:00:34.662\nIf you didn't watch it,\n\n11\n00:00:34.662 --> 00:00:37.419\nwe filmed an episode already about\nsetting up the mail server piece,\n\n12\n00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:40.940\nwe went through that whole process,\ngot the mail server up and running.\n\n13\n00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.600\nBut we never actually used the darn thing,\nright.\n\n14\n00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.480\nIt was just sitting there.\n\n15\n00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.520\nAnd we say it's a mail server, but\nhow do we know it's actually working?\n\n16\n00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.380\nSo in this episode what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna get some clients connected to\n\n17\n00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.250\nit, and actually send some email,\n\n18\n00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.820\ncuz that's kinda the whole point\nof having one of these things.\n\n19\n00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.470\nSo we're gonna jump in and\nget that set up.\n\n20\n00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.150\nNow fortunately, OS X includes an email\nplan, it's actually a pretty good one.\n\n21\n00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.270\nSome operating systems,\nlike that one from those Microsoft people,\n\n22\n00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.830\nhave a really crummy email\nplan package with them.\n\n23\n00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.700\nBut in OS X,\nthe mail app is pretty full featured.\n\n24\n00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.096\nAnd if we're running our own mail server,\nwe can get connected really fast and\n\n25\n00:01:13.096 --> 00:01:16.455\nnow we're up and we're running and\nwe don't need any third party software.\n\n26\n00:01:16.455 --> 00:01:18.370\nIt's all kind of self contained.\n\n27\n00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.373\nSo let's tackle that.\n\n28\n00:01:19.373 --> 00:01:23.077\nAnd before I jump into the client, let me\nstart here in this server and just recap\n\n29\n00:01:23.077 --> 00:01:27.270\nso my settings, cuz we are gonna need\nsome information to get a client setup.\n\n30\n00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.050\nWhen a client connects to a mail server,\nthey're going to use two protocols.\n\n31\n00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.066\nOne for sending e-mail and\none for receiving e-mail.\n\n32\n00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:40.070\nNow on the sending side it's only SMTP,\nthere's just one protocol, that's easy.\n\n33\n00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.130\nBut on the receiving side\nthere's two protocols, and so\n\n34\n00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.400\nI need to look at my server\nto see what's even supported.\n\n35\n00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.901\nSo before you connect a client,\nwe need to understand some basic things,\n\n36\n00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:50.790\nlike how can I authenticate?\n\n37\n00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.365\nRight now my authentication is\nset to automatic, right, so\n\n38\n00:01:53.365 --> 00:01:56.457\nI'm in the server app and I'm just\ngoing to the mail server to find this.\n\n39\n00:01:56.457 --> 00:02:00.713\nAnd authentication is set to automatic, so\nthat means that I can use Open Directory,\n\n40\n00:02:00.713 --> 00:02:03.270\nActive Directory,\nLocal Users, whatever it is.\n\n41\n00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.140\nNow I'm not connected\nto an Active Directory,\n\n42\n00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.790\nso I'm gonna have to use\nan Open Directory account or\n\n43\n00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.890\na Local User account to be able to\nauthenticate and connect to email.\n\n44\n00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.000\nSo that's fine, I've got an Open\nDirectory, that's what I'm gonna use.\n\n45\n00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.638\nAfter that,\n\n46\n00:02:15.638 --> 00:02:18.954\nI'm kind of left to the various\nprotocols that I wanna connect via.\n\n47\n00:02:18.954 --> 00:02:24.150\nAnd Apple supports all the main ones.\n\n48\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.455\nSMTP for sending email, and we have\nPOP3 and IMAP4 for receiving email.\n\n49\n00:02:30.455 --> 00:02:33.405\nSo when I set up my client,\nI can kind of pick and choose.\n\n50\n00:02:33.405 --> 00:02:36.155\nSo let's jump over to\na client like this guy.\n\n51\n00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:40.475\nSo here I've got an El Capitan install\nthat is basically a stock install that I\n\n52\n00:02:40.475 --> 00:02:43.755\nhaven't really messed with, and\nwe're gonna configure that mail app.\n\n53\n00:02:43.755 --> 00:02:46.335\nAnd the mail app is right\nhere in our dock by default.\n\n54\n00:02:46.335 --> 00:02:50.100\nSo we'll just fired that up, and\nit's got no mail account by default, so\n\n55\n00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.380\nwe gotta add one.\n\n56\n00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.096\nSo it's offering to connect iCloud,\nwhich is what Apple wants everybody use\n\n57\n00:02:56.096 --> 00:03:00.810\nthese days, we've got Microsoft Exchange,\nyou've got Google for Gmail or\n\n58\n00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.456\nGoogle apps, Yahoo email and\nAOL, or Other Mail Account.\n\n59\n00:03:04.456 --> 00:03:08.280\nIf you're hosting your own server,\nyou are a Other Mail Account.\n\n60\n00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.250\nSo I'll need to choose that and\nhit Continue.\n\n61\n00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.570\nThe nice part about picking\none of these others is that\n\n62\n00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.750\nApple already knows who\nthe mail server should be.\n\n63\n00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.200\nApple already knows,\ndo they use SMTP, do they use POP3,\n\n64\n00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.342\ndo they use IMAP 4, they already know\nall of that for these providers.\n\n65\n00:03:24.342 --> 00:03:27.177\nSo if you are using one of those\nproviders, that's what you wanna choose,\n\n66\n00:03:27.177 --> 00:03:30.740\nbut in our case we have our own server,\nso we've gotta choose other.\n\n67\n00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.440\nAnd now it's gonna try and\nautomatically discover the mail server.\n\n68\n00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.560\nNow this works great for things like\nGmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, whatever, because\n\n69\n00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.970\nthey have auto discovery records that\nare set up to be able to find your server.\n\n70\n00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.640\nFor your own private server though, we\ndon't have those auto discovery records,\n\n71\n00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.800\nand so this doesn't normally work.\n\n72\n00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.970\nSometimes it will work if your client is\non the same network as the mail server,\n\n73\n00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.667\nlike Bonjour could do some discovery, but\n\n74\n00:03:55.667 --> 00:03:57.360\nyou'll find that most of\nthe time it doesn't work.\n\n75\n00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.370\nI'll give it a shot here just\nto see if it finds mine.\n\n76\n00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.640\nSo I am putting in my email\naddress donpezet@lab.itpro.tv and\n\n77\n00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.460\nI'll punch in my password.\n\n78\n00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.800\nAnd then we will attempt to sign in.\n\n79\n00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.040\nSo what it's going to do is going\nto try and find that mail server.\n\n80\n00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.790\nNow I fully expect it to fail.\n\n81\n00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.820\nAnd if it fails, the screen just\nbecomes a little more complex.\n\n82\n00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.780\nAnd now we have the ability to type\nin all the details it couldn't\n\n83\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.570\nautomatically figure out.\n\n84\n00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.320\nSo, the user name is set to automatic.\n\n85\n00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.170\nAnd by automatic it means I'm\ngonna use the email address.\n\n86\n00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.410\nMost systems use the email address as the\nuser name and so we can stick with that.\n\n87\n00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.540\nBut some don't.\n\n88\n00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.780\nLike if I'm connecting to a Microsoft\nActive Directory, your user name might\n\n89\n00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.790\nnot match your email address and so you\ncan override that right here if you want.\n\n90\n00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.690\nThen you punch in your password.\n\n91\n00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.010\nNext, you've gotta provide what\ntype of account it's going to be.\n\n92\n00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.940\nIs it IMAP or POP?\n\n93\n00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.910\nI always talk about these two.\n\n94\n00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.630\nThe original protocol for receiving\nemail is POPs, the Post Office Protocol.\n\n95\n00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.916\nAnd what it would let you do is your\nclient can connect to a mail server, and\n\n96\n00:05:00.916 --> 00:05:02.931\nit can say,\nhey do you have a new email for me?\n\n97\n00:05:02.931 --> 00:05:04.620\nAnd the server would say yes.\n\n98\n00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.860\nAnd you would grab a copy of it and\n\n99\n00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.070\ndelete the email from the server, and so\nnow the email just existed on your system.\n\n100\n00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.659\nAnd so the server only had new email,\nit never had old email.\n\n101\n00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.930\nWell, that was fine when people\njust had one computer, but\n\n102\n00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.240\nthere's some problems with that.\n\n103\n00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.400\nFor example, what happens if your computer\ncrashes, if your hard drive dies?\n\n104\n00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.900\nYou just lost all your email, right?\n\n105\n00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.590\nThe server doesn't have a copy of it\nanymore, so that was one problem.\n\n106\n00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.923\nAnother problem is what\nif I had two devices?\n\n107\n00:05:30.923 --> 00:05:34.090\nI might download some email on one\ndevice and some email on another device.\n\n108\n00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.393\nSo back when POP was created, it was\nlucky for someone to have one computer,\n\n109\n00:05:37.393 --> 00:05:39.580\nbetter yet two, so it wasn't a big deal.\n\n110\n00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.260\nBut in today's world where you\nhave a tablet, and a phone and\n\n111\n00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.630\na computer, it doesn't work so well.\n\n112\n00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.230\nSo they actually had to change POP.\n\n113\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.380\nIn POP version 3, you can leave email on\nthe server and you can mark it as read.\n\n114\n00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.828\nSo now one device will know that another\ndevice has already read the email or\n\n115\n00:05:53.828 --> 00:05:57.100\ndownloaded it, but it gets left\non the server, so that's good.\n\n116\n00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.782\nBut it also is still very simple.\n\n117\n00:05:58.782 --> 00:06:00.920\nIt doesn't support things like folders.\n\n118\n00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.350\nI don't about you Wes, but\n\n119\n00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.090\nI create a ton of folders inside of my\nmailbox, POP doesn't let you do that.\n\n120\n00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.350\nSo everything is in one big folder,\nand if you have an email box\n\n121\n00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.160\nwith 10,000 emails in it,\nthat's a bit of challenge, right.\n\n122\n00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.324\nSo POP is the older protocol.\n\n123\n00:06:15.324 --> 00:06:19.724\nStill works, still perfectly viable,\nbut largely it's been replaced by IMAP.\n\n124\n00:06:19.724 --> 00:06:22.023\nAnd you saw how the mail\nclient defaulted to IMAP,\n\n125\n00:06:22.023 --> 00:06:24.620\nthat's what most people\nare going to want to use.\n\n126\n00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.220\nWith IMAP, it supports sub-folders,\nit was designed to leave the emails\n\n127\n00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.130\non the server, so, if your client loses\nits hard drive, it's no big deal,\n\n128\n00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.580\nall your email's still on the server.\n\n129\n00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.250\nYou can mark messages as read, so\n\n130\n00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.950\neverybody can see that\nit's already been read.\n\n131\n00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.550\nIt handles multiple devices just fine.\n\n132\n00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.170\nSo it's a very well rounded protocol and\nit's the one you wanna use.\n\n133\n00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.060\nNow, the Mac mail server supports both.\n\n134\n00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.600\nSo I could choose either here and\nget connected, but for\n\n135\n00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.899\nthe best functionality, I wanna do IMAP.\n\n136\n00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.070\nThen I need to put the name of my server.\n\n137\n00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.590\nNow the name of the server, is well,\nhowever you connect to it, right?\n\n138\n00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.664\nSo mine is osxserver01.lab.itpro.tv,\n\n139\n00:06:58.664 --> 00:07:02.526\nyou'll put in whatever\nthe name of yours is.\n\n140\n00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.630\nYour outgoing mail server might not be\nthe same as your incoming mail server.\n\n141\n00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.810\nSo you might have one SMTP server that you\nsend out through, and a different POP and\n\n142\n00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.780\nIMAP server that you receive through.\n\n143\n00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.150\nIn my scenario where I'm using\nthe Mac mail server, it's all in one.\n\n144\n00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.321\nSo I'm gonna put the exact\nsame name in the next box.\n\n145\n00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:22.919\nThere, so it'll be the same.\n\n146\n00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.920\nNow it only lets me set one username and\npassword here.\n\n147\n00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.240\nMost SMTP servers authenticate based on\nIP, so you don't need a user name and\n\n148\n00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.720\npassword to send an email.\n\n149\n00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.500\nBut some do, and if that happens,\nit will prompt me for that password later.\n\n150\n00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.910\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign in.\n\n151\n00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.280\nNow it's gonna reach out to that server,\nand try and connect.\n\n152\n00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.763\nAll right, hopefully it connects.\n\n153\n00:07:43.763 --> 00:07:45.030\nThat's what I expect to see.\n\n154\n00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.820\nIf it gets a failure, it will let me know.\n\n155\n00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.390\nThere I go, all right.\n\n156\n00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.339\nSo it connected, it's asking if I\nwanna do Mail and Notes or just Mail.\n\n157\n00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:53.369\nA lot of people don't realize it,\nbut the notes system that is in,\n\n158\n00:07:53.369 --> 00:07:55.983\nthat is in Mac OS,\nthose notes are actually just emails.\n\n159\n00:07:55.983 --> 00:07:58.885\nIt stores them like emails,\nand they show up as notes.\n\n160\n00:07:58.885 --> 00:08:00.977\nWell you can sync that\nthrough your server and so\n\n161\n00:08:00.977 --> 00:08:05.140\nnow you can synchronize your notes across\nmultiple devices, kind of a cool feature.\n\n162\n00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.540\nSo I'll go ahead and let that stay on.\n\n163\n00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.470\nAnd now it's gonna connect to the server,\nall right.\n\n164\n00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.020\nSo I'm connected and\nI'm logged into mailbox.\n\n165\n00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.304\nNow it's empty, right,\nI don't have any email.\n\n166\n00:08:15.304 --> 00:08:20.300\nSo we can generate a new message or I can\nemail myself just to see something appear.\n\n167\n00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:26.550\nSo if I whip up a new email and\nI email donpezet@lab.itpro.tv,\n\n168\n00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.958\nall right, so I can email myself and\n\n169\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:34.180\nmaybe I'll cc Wes on this one,\nthere we go.\n\n170\n00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.995\nSee how it found his name?\n\n171\n00:08:35.995 --> 00:08:40.150\nIt's finding his name or\neven my name if I would have waited there.\n\n172\n00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.080\nSee how it says found on server.\n\n173\n00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.140\nIt's looking at the server and\npulling up that list of users.\n\n174\n00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.030\nIt's doing that through the contact\nservice, which I never actually turned on\n\n175\n00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.020\nthe contact service,\nit's handling that for me.\n\n176\n00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.110\nWe'll see it more in the contacts episode.\n\n177\n00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.690\nBut we get basic name lookup just\nright through the mail server.\n\n178\n00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.780\nSo I can send an email to myself.\n\n179\n00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.660\nThat's a big hint right there that\nyes I am connected to the server and\n\n180\n00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.540\nthings are working fine,\ncuz I was able to do those lookups.\n\n181\n00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.030\nSo this is a initial test email.\n\n182\n00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:12.580\nThis email will test the mail server,\nright?\n\n183\n00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.166\nSo I'm just gonna punch that in,\nand when I hit Send,\n\n184\n00:09:16.166 --> 00:09:21.600\nit's gonna use SMTP to send\nthe message to the server.\n\n185\n00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.826\nSo the Simple Mail Transport Protocol is\ngonna get used to send that to the server.\n\n186\n00:09:25.826 --> 00:09:30.243\nAnd then I'm checking\nthe server with IMAP4.\n\n187\n00:09:30.243 --> 00:09:34.730\nAnd so\nnow I see that email thanks to IMAP4.\n\n188\n00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:39.920\nSo I just tested both protocols, I was\nable to send and receive right here and\n\n189\n00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.130\nI got my own email, I emailed myself,\nwhich is not terribly exciting.\n\n190\n00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.515\nI also emailed to Wes, and so\n\n191\n00:09:44.515 --> 00:09:49.820\nWes should have the email too, and\nwe can always log in and check that out.\n\n192\n00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:54.293\nIf this didn't work, right,\nwhat could cause that problem?\n\n193\n00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:56.150\nWell, we'd need to troubleshoot it.\n\n194\n00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.660\nIt could be that I put in a bad password.\n\n195\n00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.760\nIt could be as simple as that, right?\n\n196\n00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.540\nSo we always need to check our settings.\n\n197\n00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.800\nYou can go up to Mail, and then Accounts.\n\n198\n00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.710\nAnd when you go in here,\n\n199\n00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:08.800\nyou'll see the accounts that\nyou've got set up, eventually.\n\n200\n00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.880\nThere we go.\n\n201\n00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.560\nAnd I can see lab.itpro.tv,\nand if I click on it,\n\n202\n00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.650\nI can see the basic information for it.\n\n203\n00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.320\nRight, there's nothing\nreally here except for\n\n204\n00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.270\npassword that would\nreally cause a problem.\n\n205\n00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.650\nSo if I think I put the wrong password in,\nI could fix it right here.\n\n206\n00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:27.280\nBut if I go into Advanced,\nnow I can see the Hostname for the server.\n\n207\n00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.720\nAnd so I can punch that in if there\nwas a path prefix, but there never is.\n\n208\n00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.690\nSo we can punch that information in and\nhave it in business.\n\n209\n00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:39.580\nThe path prefix, that would be if we\nneeded to connect using SSL versus not,\n\n210\n00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.270\nit auto negotiates all that though, so\n\n211\n00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.680\nyou never really have to\nput anything in there.\n\n212\n00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.570\nSo I can tweak that, I can adjust it,\n\n213\n00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.620\nI can even add in other mail accounts\nif I have more than one mail account,\n\n214\n00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.120\nyou can punch each one in,\nsee if you've got it available.\n\n215\n00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.770\nBut assuming that's all good, we should\nbe able to send and receive email.\n\n216\n00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:59.270\nIf I still can't, if I'm still having\nsome kind of a failure, it could be that\n\n217\n00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:03.660\nthere's a firewall or network connectivity\nproblem between me and the server.\n\n218\n00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.660\nAnd you can test that\na few different ways.\n\n219\n00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.470\nThe easiest way to test it, in my opinion,\nis to drop down to your terminal.\n\n220\n00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.610\nI know, I just said easy and dropped down\nto the terminal in the same sentence.\n\n221\n00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:17.140\nBut you can drop down to your terminal and\nyou can use the Telnet protocol\n\n222\n00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.230\nto test out whether you can\neven connect to the server.\n\n223\n00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.920\nSMTP uses port 25 to communicate.\n\n224\n00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:29.680\nSo I can use Telnet and I can say\ntelnet osx-server01.lab.itpro.tv and\n\n225\n00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.850\nthen I can say 25.\n\n226\n00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.500\nNormally Telnet uses port 21 to\ncreate a shell connection, but\n\n227\n00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.670\nif I tell it port 25, it's gonna\ntry to connect to the SMTP server.\n\n228\n00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.640\nAnd I should get one of two\nthings when I press Enter.\n\n229\n00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.010\nOne, I might get nothing.\n\n230\n00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:48.090\nIf I get nothing, I fail to connect,\nthat means I've got a network issue.\n\n231\n00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.352\nNetwork connectivity between me and\nthe server.\n\n232\n00:11:50.352 --> 00:11:54.910\nOr two, I should get a banner saying that\nI connected to the mail server, right?\n\n233\n00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.410\nAnd that's how I'll know that I am\nable to talk to the mail server.\n\n234\n00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.620\nSo if I run that, I got a banner.\n\n235\n00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.653\nHere's the banner saying\n220-osx-server01.lab.itpro.tv\n\n236\n00:12:03.653 --> 00:12:05.000\nESMTP Postfix.\n\n237\n00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.040\nI connected.\n\n238\n00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.620\nNow, if you really wanna test,\nif you know enough about the server,\n\n239\n00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.110\nyou can actually craft an email\nright here from this prompt.\n\n240\n00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.540\nWe'll see if I can remember enough.\n\n241\n00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.094\nThe first thing you do is\nyou say HELO with one l, and\n\n242\n00:12:16.094 --> 00:12:17.766\nyou announce your work station.\n\n243\n00:12:17.766 --> 00:12:22.680\nSo, I'm on osx-client01.lab.itpro.tv,\nright?\n\n244\n00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.800\nSo I announce myself, and now, I tell\nit that I'm gonna generate an email.\n\n245\n00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.991\nAnd this is gonna be a MAIL FROM,\nand I'll say that it's from,\n\n246\n00:12:33.488 --> 00:12:36.780\npresident@whitehouse.gov.\n\n247\n00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:37.640\nShoot, I made a mistake.\n\n248\n00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.480\nWell, you can't use backspace when you do\nit this way, cuz it thinks I'm a computer.\n\n249\n00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.110\nAnd computers don't make mistakes,\nso you can't use backspace, but\n\n250\n00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.510\nI'm just telling it,\nI'm gonna get an email from the president.\n\n251\n00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.930\nAnd it's going to be going to and\n\n252\n00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.949\nwe'll send it to donpezet@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n253\n00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:57.610\nAll right, it's ok with that.\n\n254\n00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.710\nAnd now the data for the email.\n\n255\n00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.510\nAnd so I'll have a subject,\nwhich is gonna be, congratulations!\n\n256\n00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:09.990\nAnd now a message body, congratulations on\n\n257\n00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:15.706\nyour nomination to the supreme court,\nright.\n\n258\n00:13:15.706 --> 00:13:18.220\nAnd then when I'm done I can just\nterminate that and finish it.\n\n259\n00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.930\nSo now see how it says it's queued?\n\n260\n00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.180\nI just crafted an email\nentirely on the server.\n\n261\n00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:27.500\nSo I built that email on the server,\nthe server received it, and\n\n262\n00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.270\nsaid, this is going to Don Pezet,\nlet me stick it in his mailbox.\n\n263\n00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:31.410\nAnd I don't know if you could hear it, but\n\n264\n00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.790\nthe little mail chime went off\nin the background and, so,\n\n265\n00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:38.000\nif I go back to my mail client,\nI've got an e-mail.\n\n266\n00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.410\nIt says no sender,\nI must have typed that wrong, too.\n\n267\n00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:45.210\nBut here it is, and I got an e-mail and\nit shows congratulations,\n\n268\n00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:49.170\nthat's the e-mail that came in,\nso, I just tested the mail server\n\n269\n00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:51.840\nwithout using a client,\nI use Telnet to do the whole thing.\n\n270\n00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.749\nThat's a great way to troubleshoot and\n\n271\n00:13:54.749 --> 00:14:00.136\nmake sure that server is working and\ninteresting that it says No Sender.\n\n272\n00:14:00.136 --> 00:14:02.840\nI wonder why it's doing that,\nbut I must have typed it wrong.\n\n273\n00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.972\nSo when you type that\nMAIL FROM right here,\n\n274\n00:14:05.972 --> 00:14:09.802\nthat MAIL FROM statement,\nI put it in parenthesis,\n\n275\n00:14:09.802 --> 00:14:14.600\nthat email address, and\nyou can also put the full name before it.\n\n276\n00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.980\nAnd I think cuz I left that out\nthat's why it's showing as no sender.\n\n277\n00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.110\nIf I had put a full name\nin there it'd show it.\n\n278\n00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.760\nBut that's an interesting way that you can\ngo in and you can test that connection,\n\n279\n00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.920\nwhoops let me disconnect, and\njust a neat way to troubleshoot.\n\n280\n00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.450\nIf I didn't connect there,\nI would know I had firewall issues and\n\n281\n00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.080\nnetwork connectivity and\nhave to focus on that.\n\n282\n00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.920\nSo don't spend a ton of time\ntroubleshooting the client,\n\n283\n00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.130\nwhen it might be the network\nthat's the problem.\n\n284\n00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.272\nAll right, so now that I can see that\nI've got basic mail flow going on,\n\n285\n00:14:40.272 --> 00:14:41.154\nat least for me.\n\n286\n00:14:41.154 --> 00:14:45.070\nI know I sent Wes an e-mail, and so\nI might wanna login and check for Wes.\n\n287\n00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:49.660\nNow, if I switch over to Wes' account, so\nlet me just do a little fast user switch\n\n288\n00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:55.600\nhere and I'll log in as Wes, Wes doesn't\nhave his email account set up yet.\n\n289\n00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.050\nSo I could just repeat the process\nthat I did a moment ago.\n\n290\n00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:01.580\nPunch in the login for IMAP and\nSMTP and all that good stuff.\n\n291\n00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.650\nBut there is actually a neat way that\nwe can automatically configure this,\n\n292\n00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:06.730\nif you have the Profile Manager set up.\n\n293\n00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.910\nThe Profile Manager can actually\npush configuration settings out to\n\n294\n00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:10.830\nthe end users.\n\n295\n00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.940\nWhen you have the Profile Manager set up,\nif I go and turn this thing on, I'm just\n\n296\n00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:19.126\ngonna turn the Profile Manager on, I'm\nnot gonna configure anything too crazy.\n\n297\n00:15:19.126 --> 00:15:23.220\nBut down here at the bottom, you've\ngot your Settings for Everyone, right?\n\n298\n00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.140\nThese are settings that are just gonna\npush out to every user that connects to\n\n299\n00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:26.830\nthe Profile Manager.\n\n300\n00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:31.150\nAnd if I go into Configure for that,\nyou'll see Settings for Everyone,\n\n301\n00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.810\nInclude configuration for services,\nand it's got the Mail icon, okay?\n\n302\n00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:40.104\nIf I had the calendar server,\nthe contact server, the messages server,\n\n303\n00:15:40.104 --> 00:15:43.787\nif I had all those set up too,\nthey would all light up here also.\n\n304\n00:15:43.787 --> 00:15:48.053\nAnd so now when I connect somebody to the\nProfile Manager, they'll get automatically\n\n305\n00:15:48.053 --> 00:15:52.270\nset up for email, messages, contacts,\ncalendar, all those different services.\n\n306\n00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.398\nSo it's kinda nice that it can do it and I\ndon't have to worry about all those email\n\n307\n00:15:55.398 --> 00:15:56.968\nsettings to get the client configured.\n\n308\n00:15:56.968 --> 00:15:59.259\nSo my Profile Manager is turned on now,\nand\n\n309\n00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:02.680\nit's set to publish those\nsettings to everyone.\n\n310\n00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:07.290\nSo if I jump back over here to Wes,\nI could fire up Safari, and\n\n311\n00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.570\nwe could browse to that\nprofile manager server.\n\n312\n00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.140\nAnd I didn't take the time to set\nup certificates and stuff, so\n\n313\n00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.400\nI'll get a certificate error on this,\nbut if we just ignore that.\n\n314\n00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.850\nLet me browse through the server.\n\n315\n00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:19.760\nAnd so I'm browsing through\nthe profile server and\n\n316\n00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.000\nI'm gonna go to slash my devices, right.\n\n317\n00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.670\nThat's the page that\nan end user would go to.\n\n318\n00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.460\nSo I give a new computer to somebody and\nI say hey, you just need to go to\n\n319\n00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:33.240\nthe website and go to the login screen,\nlog in with your open directory account.\n\n320\n00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.370\nSo if you log in as Wes Bryan.\n\n321\n00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.910\nHe'll punch in his password and log in.\n\n322\n00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:43.880\nAnd when he goes to log in,\nhere's the two profiles he can download.\n\n323\n00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:49.130\nThe main trust profile, so he trusts my\nserver and then settings for everyone.\n\n324\n00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:53.410\nAnd if I hit show contents on settings for\neveryone, it's got basic identification,\n\n325\n00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.570\nit always has that, and mail.\n\n326\n00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.320\nThe mail setting's right there.\n\n327\n00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.350\nSo he can download,\n\n328\n00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:01.440\nwe'll do the trust profile first,\nwhich we have to be an administrator for.\n\n329\n00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.230\nSo it's gonna ask me to authenticate.\n\n330\n00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:05.450\nAnd there it is.\n\n331\n00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.700\nSo we'll punch in the administrator so\n\n332\n00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.150\nI've got a little help desk\naccount that I've been using.\n\n333\n00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:15.340\nAnd then, now I trust the profile server,\nand so now I can come in and\n\n334\n00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.600\nI can download my other settings,\nand we'll do this install.\n\n335\n00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.930\nAnd I could've pushed this\nwith Apple Remote Desktop, or\n\n336\n00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.560\na number of other ways too.\n\n337\n00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.850\nHere it's just asking for\na password for wesbrian@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n338\n00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:29.290\nIt already knows his email address.\n\n339\n00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.690\nIt already knows the server to connect to.\n\n340\n00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.650\nThe only thing it doesn't\nknow is his password.\n\n341\n00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.650\nAnd so we'll punch in that password and\n\n342\n00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:38.280\nit's gonna configure everything else for\nme.\n\n343\n00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.440\nSo now if I go back into\nmy system settings here and\n\n344\n00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.623\nI go to internet accounts,\nsee how it’s already got set up for mail.\n\n345\n00:17:44.623 --> 00:17:46.890\nI didn’t have to know the server name.\n\n346\n00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:49.680\nI didn’t have to know,\nis it IMAP or is it POP.\n\n347\n00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.360\nIt just automatically populates that so\n\n348\n00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.470\nwhen I choose it, now right here\nit’s already got the server name,\n\n349\n00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.120\nit’s already got his information,\nthe account is enabled.\n\n350\n00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.880\nIf I go into Advanced to scout the server\neverything’s already configured.\n\n351\n00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:07.280\nSo, if I’m using the profile manager\nall the user has to do is log in and\n\n352\n00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.990\nfire up the mail client and\nit'll already be set up.\n\n353\n00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.960\nThat's the best.\n\n354\n00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.560\nIf you've got thousands of users,\nyou don't want it to go and\n\n355\n00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.450\nadd this account to every one.\n\n356\n00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:16.982\nNow they just log in and\nit's already set up,\n\n357\n00:18:16.982 --> 00:18:20.290\nbecause it's part of the profile manager's\ncontrol profile for that machine.\n\n358\n00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:23.100\nAnd so when I log in as Wes,\nthere's that email and\n\n359\n00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.380\nI can see he got the initial email and\nhe can reply back and\n\n360\n00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.650\nsay, that's great, or\nwhatever it is that Wes is prone to say.\n\n361\n00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.080\nThree, four,\n\n362\n00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.620\nexclamation points because that's how Wes\nrolls and we'll go ahead and send that.\n\n363\n00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.360\nAnd so now he's up and communicating.\n\n364\n00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.620\nI received the email, right.\n\n365\n00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:45.100\nSo I know that POP3 is working, or IMAP4,\nwhichever one it is that I'm using.\n\n366\n00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.190\nAnd then I've sent it so\nI'm seeing if SMTP is working.\n\n367\n00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:51.970\nAnd so now if I jump back over to\nmy account I should have a new\n\n368\n00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:52.530\nemail from Wes.\n\n369\n00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.910\nAnd we'll see if that happens.\n\n370\n00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:57.300\nAssuming that I do.\n\n371\n00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.700\nThere it is.\nI got an email from Wes.\n\n372\n00:18:58.700 --> 00:18:59.530\nThat's great.\n\n373\n00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:00.280\nLook at that.\n\n374\n00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.080\nIt is great, isn't it,\nwhen things actually work.\n\n375\n00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.520\nSo there it is, it's working.\n\n376\n00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.430\nIn the background a lot actually happened.\n\n377\n00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.360\nRight?\n\n378\n00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.120\nWes wrote the email and\ndid that in his client.\n\n379\n00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.330\nHe hit send.\n\n380\n00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:15.060\nAn SMTP connection was made between\nthe client and the server and\n\n381\n00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.860\nhe handed the email to the server.\n\n382\n00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.620\nWhen that happened It went to\nthe server's incoming queue.\n\n383\n00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:25.044\nSo on the server that incoming queue\n\n384\n00:19:25.044 --> 00:19:29.763\nis buried down here on the hard drive,\n\n385\n00:19:29.763 --> 00:19:38.471\ninside of /Library/Server/Mail/Data/ and\nmail, there we go.\n\n386\n00:19:38.471 --> 00:19:41.153\nSo a couple of different things happen\nactually before it even got there.\n\n387\n00:19:41.153 --> 00:19:44.830\nSo, the, [LAUGH] I'm gonna\nscrew this up as much as I can.\n\n388\n00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:48.930\nSo, what happened was, the email came in,\nand the email came in to this\n\n389\n00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:53.650\nfolder right here,\n/Library/Server/Mail/Data/spool.\n\n390\n00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.080\nThat's where incoming email comes in.\n\n391\n00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.990\nSo, he wrote an email via SMTP,\nwhich transferred to the server.\n\n392\n00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.510\nIt was dropped right here in this folder.\n\n393\n00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.070\nOkay, when you look at this folder.\n\n394\n00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.590\nFor the most part it should be empty.\n\n395\n00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:04.160\nRight?\n\n396\n00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:09.590\nAnd, well, it's got some folders, so,\nincoming is where it actually ends up.\n\n397\n00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:13.310\nThere, which is protected,\nso let me get around that.\n\n398\n00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.770\nAnd eventually we'll be able to\nsee the contents of this folder,\n\n399\n00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:16.970\nwhich should be empty.\n\n400\n00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.540\nThere we go.\n[LAUGH] It's kinda anti-climactic, right?\n\n401\n00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:23.990\nBut it should be empty, because emails\nshouldn't sit there in the spool.\n\n402\n00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:27.030\nAn email should come in,\nbe processed and sent out.\n\n403\n00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.650\nIf emails are sitting here in the spool,\nthat means you've got a problem, right?\n\n404\n00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.900\nMaybe the server that it's heading for\nis down, and it can't get there.\n\n405\n00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.660\nOr maybe the mailbox is corrupt,\nand so it's stuck here.\n\n406\n00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.710\nIf you see emails stuck here,\nthat's a problem.\n\n407\n00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.240\nSo, it should be empty.\n\n408\n00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.930\nHis email came here, the server saw it.\n\n409\n00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:46.040\nIt looked at it, scanned it for\nspam, scanned it for viruses.\n\n410\n00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.000\nOnce that was done,\nit recognized that it was destined for\n\n411\n00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.150\nmy mailbox, and it put it in my mailbox.\n\n412\n00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.490\nNow my mailbox,\nis not here in the Spool folder,\n\n413\n00:20:55.490 --> 00:21:00.980\nit's actually back here in the Data\nfolder inside of the Mail sub-folder.\n\n414\n00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:04.050\nAnd inside of the Mail\nsub-folder what you're gonna see\n\n415\n00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:07.330\nare a couple of different folders here and\nsee how they're all owned by dovecot?\n\n416\n00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:09.240\nDovecot is the POP3 and IMAP4 server.\n\n417\n00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.720\nAnd so I can see these individual\nGUIDs that are created.\n\n418\n00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.180\nThe map to each of our mailboxes.\n\n419\n00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.490\nNow I don't know which one is me.\n\n420\n00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:19.060\nOne of those would be mine.\n\n421\n00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.360\nOne of those would be Wes.\n\n422\n00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.080\nAnd you've got this users folder\nwhere additional data is stored,\n\n423\n00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.340\nwhich is like metadata for our mailboxes.\n\n424\n00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:31.290\nAnd if I pull some of that,\nactually that one.\n\n425\n00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.200\nThere we go.\n\n426\n00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:38.130\nI can see Don Pezet and [LAUGH], having\na hard time typing today, there we go.\n\n427\n00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:44.670\nDon Pezet and Wes Bryan, and if I look in\nthere, I can start to see the message log,\n\n428\n00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:48.840\nthe key words, all that metadata\nthat's being stored from my mailbox.\n\n429\n00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.190\nAll right in there and somewhere in there,\n\n430\n00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:53.970\none of those entities\nare identified which GUID is mine.\n\n431\n00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:58.720\nAnd then my actual message is,\nend up in whichever one of these nice,\n\n432\n00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.400\nlong easier member folders is typed me.\n\n433\n00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.880\nI don't know which one.\n\n434\n00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.400\nSo, if I were to try and\npull out just one of those, there we go.\n\n435\n00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.550\nYou look inside of it and you see a lot\nof the same type data that's tied to it.\n\n436\n00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:15.260\nSo that's where all of our information is\nactually ending up, maildirfolder, right?\n\n437\n00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.600\nSo it's all tucked away in there,\nand then when I go to check my mail,\n\n438\n00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.930\nI reach out with dovecot\nIMAP 4 in this case.\n\n439\n00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:24.190\nAnd it says yeah, you've got new email,\nhere let me send it to you.\n\n440\n00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:28.270\nAnd the client downloads it, and\nwe see it right here in the mail app.\n\n441\n00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.850\nSo its a lot cleaner and a lot easier.\n\n442\n00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.680\nThe end users don't see all the stuff\ngoing on behind the scenes, but\n\n443\n00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.500\nthat's what's actually happening.\n\n444\n00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:40.380\nA lot of places something can go wrong and\nstop an email from flowing And\n\n445\n00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.190\nwith troubleshooting,\nthe Telnet tool that I showed you guys,\n\n446\n00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:44.610\nthat works out really well.\n\n447\n00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:48.660\nBut usually the first place I go\nto troubleshoot is the server log.\n\n448\n00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:53.460\nThat if we jump back to our server and\nyou go up to logs,\n\n449\n00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:57.650\ninside of logs you've got specific\nlogs for the mail server.\n\n450\n00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:58.720\nAnd so if I come down here and\n\n451\n00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.470\nlook at it, under mail it's got\nmore logs than anything else.\n\n452\n00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.120\nYou've got antivirus logs.\n\n453\n00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.537\nYou got junk mail and spam scanning logs.\n\n454\n00:23:06.537 --> 00:23:08.210\nYou got the mail server log itself.\n\n455\n00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:12.170\nYou got a log just for IMAP,\njust for POP and just for SMTP.\n\n456\n00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:14.270\nHow do I know I'm actually using IMAP 4?\n\n457\n00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:17.605\nWell it's kind of hard to see,\nin the mail client it doesn't show you but\n\n458\n00:23:17.605 --> 00:23:20.395\nI can go to my POP log and\nsee that it's empty.\n\n459\n00:23:20.395 --> 00:23:22.895\nRight?\nSo nobody's connecting via POP, and\n\n460\n00:23:22.895 --> 00:23:27.515\nI can flip to my i-map log and\nsee that I've got all these connections.\n\n461\n00:23:27.515 --> 00:23:30.770\nAnd I can see connections coming\nfrom a particular client.\n\n462\n00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:32.960\nIf the user's not filled in\nthen it hasn't logged in.\n\n463\n00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.690\nBut right after that,\n\n464\n00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:37.450\nsee how I see the login for wesbryan,\nso this is Wes connecting via imap.\n\n465\n00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:40.660\nAnd up here I see donpezet\nconnecting via imap.\n\n466\n00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.900\nSo you can actually spot that.\n\n467\n00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.757\nAnd if there's some kind of\ntroubleshooting problems,\n\n468\n00:23:43.757 --> 00:23:46.260\nif it's a bad password, or whatever,\nyou'll see that information.\n\n469\n00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:51.810\nOr here I'm just seeing\nDisconnected: Logged out in=30 out=510.\n\n470\n00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:55.010\nI was connected and I idled,\nand so I disconnected.\n\n471\n00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:59.530\nAnd so, in that time I sent 30 bytes of\ndata and I received 510 bytes of data.\n\n472\n00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:02.050\nAnd you'll see more connections\nthat are like that as we\n\n473\n00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:04.130\nquery to see if the mailbox\nhad data in it.\n\n474\n00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.540\nThose are periodic check\nins that are occurring.\n\n475\n00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.250\nAll that's right here in the logs,\n\n476\n00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.780\nyou can pull up all that\ninformation if you have a problem.\n\n477\n00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.720\nThe mail server error log is\nanother great way to look.\n\n478\n00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.740\nAnd you'll see here where\nI made some changes and\n\n479\n00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.460\nsort of had to reload the config.\n\n480\n00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.910\nThat's not a error,\nthat is just kind of a notice.\n\n481\n00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:23.050\nBut then you have other\nerrors that pop up in here.\n\n482\n00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:26.220\n>> Well, Don, if we do not have anything\nelse, what do you say if we wrap this up?\n\n483\n00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.370\nBut before we do,\ndo you got any additional information?\n\n484\n00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.330\n>> You know, here in the show for\nthe sake of the exam,\n\n485\n00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.880\nwe focused on the mail app inside of OS\n10 because that will be what on the exam.\n\n486\n00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.658\nIn real life land,\nyou could be using anything.\n\n487\n00:24:36.658 --> 00:24:40.290\nYou could use Thunderbird, or heck,\nyou can even go old school Unix and\n\n488\n00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:42.630\nthrow in Pine or\nsomething crazy like that if you wanted.\n\n489\n00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:46.970\nIt all works, this is all open standard\nstuff so really compatible, but\n\n490\n00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.280\non the exam you will\njust see the mail client.\n\n491\n00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.870\nSo as long as you've got that under\nyour belt, you're in good shape.\n\n492\n00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:53.620\n>> All right, well we appreciate that\ninformation and we appreciate you,\n\n493\n00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.220\nthe viewer.\n\n494\n00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.940\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n495\n00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:57.940\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n496\n00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.327\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n497\n00:25:00.327 --> 00:25:08.300\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.429\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.430\nwe're continuing through our\nOS X Server Essentials, and\n\n5\n00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.591\nover the last couple of episodes we've\nbeen looking at Collaborative Services.\n\n6\n00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:26.720\nWell, we're gonna keep\non that train here and\n\n7\n00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.130\njoining us in the studios is\nnone other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.250\nDon, how you doing today, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.190\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.030\nReady to collaborate and listen.\n\n11\n00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.630\nSo, in this episodes,\n\n12\n00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.830\nwe're gonna be tackling the Calendar\nservice inside of the Server app.\n\n13\n00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.750\nIf you're watching these episodes in\norder, our the last episode was the Mail\n\n14\n00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.280\nserver, which is arguably the most\nuseful collaboration service.\n\n15\n00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.820\nYou email people, they can read it, and\n\n16\n00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.530\nyou just talk to somebody,\nit's great, it's exciting.\n\n17\n00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.140\nWith a calendar,\nwe don't really talk to people, right?\n\n18\n00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.720\nBut you do coordinate\nevents with a calendar.\n\n19\n00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.390\nSo for example,\n\n20\n00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.550\nI might want to schedule a meeting, and\nI want to invite Wes to the meeting.\n\n21\n00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.280\nSo I need to let him know\nthat there's a meeting,\n\n22\n00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.270\nI need to get it put it on my calendar,\nI need to put it on his calendar.\n\n23\n00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.060\nThose are all things that go into\nsetting up and scheduling a meeting.\n\n24\n00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.630\nWell, the Calendar service\ncan facilitate that.\n\n25\n00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.030\nNow, you don't actually\nneed the Calendar service.\n\n26\n00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.360\nEverybody has the calendar app on their\nMac already, so you can just fire up your\n\n27\n00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.130\ncalendar and start creating\nevents to your heart's content.\n\n28\n00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.320\nThe problem is,\nthose are decentralized calendars.\n\n29\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.160\nIn other words, if I launch\nthe calendar app on my laptop, and\n\n30\n00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.130\nI start creating events, they exist\nright here on my laptop and that's it.\n\n31\n00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.470\nIf I get a new laptop,\nthose calendar events aren't there.\n\n32\n00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.170\nIf I invite Wes to a meeting,\nand I put it on my calendar,\n\n33\n00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.730\nthat's great, it's not on his calendar.\n\n34\n00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.840\nA centralized calendar,\na shared calendar is what we need.\n\n35\n00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.490\nWe need some way to tie\neverybody's calendars together,\n\n36\n00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.920\nand there's a few reasons for that, right?\n\n37\n00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.720\nThere might be that we want to\nhave a true central calendar,\n\n38\n00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.180\nlike a corporate calendar.\n\n39\n00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.784\nThese are the days that we are open,\nthese are the days that we are closed,\n\n40\n00:01:54.784 --> 00:01:56.763\nhere's special events like\nthe end of our fiscal year.\n\n41\n00:01:56.763 --> 00:02:00.417\nThose are corporate calendar type items so\nwe might have that one big shared\n\n42\n00:02:00.417 --> 00:02:05.020\ncalendar, but then we want everyone else\nto have their own individual calendars.\n\n43\n00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.660\nBut we still want them stored centrally.\n\n44\n00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.180\nAnd there's a big reason for that.\n\n45\n00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.270\nThere's the backup reason right that we\ndon't want if someone's laptop fails we\n\n46\n00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.290\ndon't want them to lose their calendar.\n\n47\n00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.380\nIf we have it centralized It\ncan be stored on a server.\n\n48\n00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.870\nIt can be backed up there.\n\n49\n00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.640\nBut the other thing is if I want to\nschedule a meeting, and I want to schedule\n\n50\n00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.390\nit for tomorrow I might say when is\nWes going to be available tomorrow.\n\n51\n00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.360\nWell, in a decentralized environment,\nI just have to pick a time.\n\n52\n00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.820\nI'm gonna say, hey, I'm gonna\nschedule a meeting for 2 PM tomorrow.\n\n53\n00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.250\nAnd let me just invite Wes.\n\n54\n00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.220\nAnd then Wes can accept or decline.\n\n55\n00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.480\nIf he's busy at 2 PM tomorrow,\nhe'll decline it.\n\n56\n00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.180\nAnd now I gotta go and\nfind another time, and\n\n57\n00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.000\nwe keep guessing like that until we find\na good time that lines up for everybody.\n\n58\n00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.930\nThe more people in the meeting,\nthe harder that becomes.\n\n59\n00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.710\nIf we have centralized calendars,\nI can actually view Wes' free busy data.\n\n60\n00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.670\nI can look and, not necessarily see\nwhat he's doing, at any given time, but\n\n61\n00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.600\nI can see whether he's busy or not.\n\n62\n00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.390\nAnd so, when I look at Wes' calendar for\ntomorrow, I might see that he's busy.\n\n63\n00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.150\nFrom noon to 2 PM and\nbusy from 3 PM to 5 PM, but\n\n64\n00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.280\nfrom 2 to 3, he's available, and\nso if I schedule a meeting and\n\n65\n00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.020\nI put it in that slot, he's more likely\nto accept and attend the meeting.\n\n66\n00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.710\nNow, we're better able to manage\nwhen people are available, and\n\n67\n00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.670\na centralized calendar server\nis what facilitates that.\n\n68\n00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.100\nNow that sounds complex, its a lot of\nmoving pieces and believe me it is.\n\n69\n00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.292\nIts a hard thing to set up\nunless we have the Server app.\n\n70\n00:03:28.292 --> 00:03:32.718\nRight, the Server app, Apple takes open\nsource source Caliber Technologies, and\n\n71\n00:03:32.718 --> 00:03:35.597\nthey package it in a super-easy\nto implement manner.\n\n72\n00:03:35.597 --> 00:03:39.855\nWe can turn this on, get it set up and\nhave people connected in short order.\n\n73\n00:03:39.855 --> 00:03:42.235\n>> Don, how about compatibility\nwith other clients?\n\n74\n00:03:42.235 --> 00:03:43.597\nIs that something we get here as well?\n\n75\n00:03:43.597 --> 00:03:47.220\n>> Yeah, so it is based on\nOpenSource technologies, and\n\n76\n00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.250\nwhat it's really based off of\nis something called CalDAV.\n\n77\n00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.480\nCal is C-A-L for Calendar and DAV is D-A-V\nfor Distributed, Authoring and Versioning.\n\n78\n00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.200\nThat might sound familiar to you,\n\n79\n00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.720\nin another episode we\ntalked about WebDAV Right?\n\n80\n00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.940\nWeb Distributed Authoring and Versioning.\n\n81\n00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.279\nAnd what WebDAV did is, it allows people\nto edit a website via some standards,\n\n82\n00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:09.360\nprotocols.\n\n83\n00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.310\nWell, CalDAV lets you do the same\nthing but for a calendar.\n\n84\n00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.570\nIt's the same protocol converted over, and\n\n85\n00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.000\nbecause it's an open standard protocol,\npretty much everybody supports it.\n\n86\n00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.500\nYou can connect to a CalDAV calendar\nfrom the calendar app inside of a mac,\n\n87\n00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.050\nwhich is what will be on the exam.\n\n88\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.110\nBut in real life you can connect from\nThunderbird or Microsoft Outlook.\n\n89\n00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.930\nYou can connect from any third party\ncalendar service that supports the CalDAV\n\n90\n00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.670\nprotocol, which most of them do.\n\n91\n00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.070\nSo, it's pretty cool that you can\nconnect with however you want,\n\n92\n00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.150\nand then the counter store\nthe same way on the server.\n\n93\n00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.990\n>> Now Don, in some of the other services,\nthe network services and\n\n94\n00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.450\nhere on the Collaborative Services,\n\n95\n00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.360\nyou've shown us how we fire up\nthe server up and we turn it on.\n\n96\n00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.310\nNow, is that what we're gonna be doing\nhere or is it gonna be a little bit more\n\n97\n00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.170\nconfiguration as to go on before we\ncan get this set up and running?\n\n98\n00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.190\nThis is pretty much\na flip-the-switch type thing.\n\n99\n00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.810\nLet me show you here, so\nI'm on my server, and,\n\n100\n00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.470\nthis is the same server I used in the Mail\nepisode, so when we set up a Mail server.\n\n101\n00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.960\nSo, the only thing really special about it\nis, I do have an Open Directory, right?\n\n102\n00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.550\nYou don't have to have an open\ndirectory to make all this stuff work.\n\n103\n00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.840\nBut, the Collaboration Services are really\ndesigned to work with an Open Directory.\n\n104\n00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.440\nAnd have it with the user accounts\nexist here on the server.\n\n105\n00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.790\nIf you do it without it,\ndiscovery becomes a real challenge.\n\n106\n00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.960\nSo this is normally going to\nbe coupled open directory.\n\n107\n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.910\nSo, if you don't know about open\ndirectory check out our episode on that,\n\n108\n00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.160\nwe show how to set it up and\nget all that fired up.\n\n109\n00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.710\nBut the calendar itself is right up here.\n\n110\n00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.060\nThe Calendar service.\n\n111\n00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.070\nAnd we can pull up its configuration and\nas soon as it loads,\n\n112\n00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.540\nyou'll see there's not\na whole lot to set up.\n\n113\n00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.760\nIn fact, if I really wanted, I could\njust hit the On button and I'm done.\n\n114\n00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.030\nThat's it,\nI'm now a calendar server, right?\n\n115\n00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.250\nEverything else is gonna be\ndone from the client side.\n\n116\n00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.090\nWell, there are a few things\nthat we can customize here.\n\n117\n00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.600\nSome of this is stuff that we've\nseen plenty of times, right?\n\n118\n00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.430\nPermissions, I can dictate who is allowed\nto connect to the server and who isn't.\n\n119\n00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.990\nMaybe I do not want all\nmy users to connect,\n\n120\n00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.270\nor maybe I want anonymous\nusers to be able to connect.\n\n121\n00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.930\nI can pick, right?\n\n122\n00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.430\nSo we edit permissions to set that.\n\n123\n00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.740\nAfter that, we've got how invitations and\nalerts are handled, right?\n\n124\n00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.960\nAn alert is like a reminder\nbell that goes off.\n\n125\n00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.210\nHey you've got a meeting\nin fifteen minutes, right.\n\n126\n00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.510\nHow were those handled?\n\n127\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.780\nWell, invitations are handled via email.\n\n128\n00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.380\nIf I invite Wes to a meeting,\nhow does it tell him that he's invited?\n\n129\n00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.730\nAnd he needs to accept or decline.\n\n130\n00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:21.710\nHow is that handled?\n\n131\n00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.260\nIt's handled via an email.\n\n132\n00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.010\nWe send an email to him.\n\n133\n00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.540\nHe sees it as a calendar invite.\n\n134\n00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.720\nHe accepts or declines, and\nsends an email back to us.\n\n135\n00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.550\nNow we know if he's going to attend.\n\n136\n00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.910\nAnd so if we want to enable that,\nwe need to turn it on on the server.\n\n137\n00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.260\nAnd when we turn it on,\n\n138\n00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.480\nwe've gotta specify the mail server that\nwe're gonna use to communicate with, okay?\n\n139\n00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.500\nAnd if we want this to really work well,\nwe need to have that account set up,\n\n140\n00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.280\nnot just to be able to send email,\nbut to be able to receive email too.\n\n141\n00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.040\nWe've gotta receive the response that\nlets us know whether Wes accepted or\n\n142\n00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.930\ndeclined that email.\n\n143\n00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.060\nSo we'll need to set up an email\naccount to get this really working, but\n\n144\n00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.750\nit is optional.\n\n145\n00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.640\nYou don't have to set that up,\n\n146\n00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.900\nit's just you're going to lose some\nfunctionality by not having it.\n\n147\n00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.660\nSame thing with push notifications.\n\n148\n00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.310\nBy default,\n\n149\n00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.700\nthe clients have to check in with us to\nsee if there's been any calendar updates,\n\n150\n00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.460\nso every so often they'll check in and\nlook to see if the calendar has changed.\n\n151\n00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.940\nBut if I set up Push Notifications as\nsoon as we make a change to the calendar\n\n152\n00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.920\na push goes out to the clients, and\nthey learn that that change has occurred.\n\n153\n00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.140\nAnd they don't have to check in over and\nover again.\n\n154\n00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.800\n>> Don when we were setting up\nthe mail server, you had made mention\n\n155\n00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.410\n>> That the push notifications don't\n\n156\n00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.170\nnecessarily go to the Mac devices,\nthey go to the iOS devices.\n\n157\n00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.040\nIs this a little bit different here,\ndoes this go,\n\n158\n00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.370\ndo these push notifications go to\niOS devices and the Mac devices too?\n\n159\n00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.020\n>> It does both, yeah this one does both.\n\n160\n00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.320\nAnd in fact, I'm glad you mentioned that,\nbecause when you set up for\n\n161\n00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.240\none, you set it up for the other two.\n\n162\n00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.230\nIn the mail episode,\nI think we talked about it and\n\n163\n00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.350\ndidn't actually turn it on, right?\n\n164\n00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.410\nSo if I go to mail, yeah, so\n\n165\n00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.515\nhow my push notifications are disabled\nright now under the mail service?\n\n166\n00:07:48.515 --> 00:07:50.411\n>> Because we talked about it but\nwe didn't turn it on.\n\n167\n00:07:50.411 --> 00:07:54.703\nWell if I go back to the counter, and\nI'm gonna turn on the push notifications.\n\n168\n00:07:54.703 --> 00:07:56.015\nWill I enable that?\n\n169\n00:07:56.015 --> 00:07:58.957\nPush notifications actually\nrun through Apple.\n\n170\n00:07:58.957 --> 00:08:01.165\nSo it's gonna require\na valid verified Apple ID,\n\n171\n00:08:01.165 --> 00:08:04.650\nand I know we've seen this in other\nepisodes, but I'm gonna do it again here.\n\n172\n00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.930\nSo I'm gonna get connected\nwith a valid Apple ID,\n\n173\n00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:13.830\nassuming I remember my password,\nI think that's it.\n\n174\n00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.470\nIt's gonna get that certificate from\nApple to be able to verify who I am, so\n\n175\n00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.300\nwhen a client connects to me\nthey'll see this Apple-issued\n\n176\n00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.220\ncertificate that they'll already trust.\n\n177\n00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.392\nAnd, so now I'm configured.\n\n178\n00:08:25.392 --> 00:08:28.050\nAlthough it's showing my\nApple ID as empty, so\n\n179\n00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.644\nI don't know what's up with that,\nbut it says that it's done.\n\n180\n00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:32.990\nDid it actually turn on?\n\n181\n00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.880\nNo, it didn't turn on.\n\n182\n00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.460\nOops, there, I'm just not being patient,\nso there we go, so now I'm connected.\n\n183\n00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.300\nSo Apple ID is set to my email address and\nthen it expires, this is good for a year.\n\n184\n00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.960\nSo a year from now I'll\nhave to renew this.\n\n185\n00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.350\nAnd you renew by hitting the renew button,\nit's really, really hard.\n\n186\n00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:48.680\nSo that's it, right?\n\n187\n00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.520\nSo I now have push notifications\nenabled for the calendar.\n\n188\n00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.110\nIf I jump over to Mail,\npush notifications are enabled, right?\n\n189\n00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.800\nSo we only have to send it out once.\n\n190\n00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.520\nIf you have the Profile Manager,\n\n191\n00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.700\nyou're definitely going to\nwant push notifications.\n\n192\n00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.290\nAnd so when you turn that on,\nit turns it on for everything else, too.\n\n193\n00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.550\nSo you just have to set that up once.\n\n194\n00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.820\nThe email notifications though,\nthat's different.\n\n195\n00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.720\nThe invitations, that we're gonna\nhave to set up here, right?\n\n196\n00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.710\nBut once that's done,\n\n197\n00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.885\nthat's really the last thing that we\nneed to configure here for our system.\n\n198\n00:09:15.885 --> 00:09:17.320\nAnd then, we're in business.\n\n199\n00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.545\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nset up the invitation system real quick.\n\n200\n00:09:20.545 --> 00:09:23.945\nWhat I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna do\na dedicated user account for that.\n\n201\n00:09:23.945 --> 00:09:26.925\nSo I'm going to go into my Users, and\n\n202\n00:09:26.925 --> 00:09:32.986\nI'll create a new Open Directory\naccount which I'm gonna call a Meeting,\n\n203\n00:09:32.986 --> 00:09:37.234\n[LAUGH] which I can't spell,\nMeeting Invitations.\n\n204\n00:09:37.234 --> 00:09:41.357\nAll right, so this is gonna be\nmeetinginvitations@live.ITPro.tv.\n\n205\n00:09:41.357 --> 00:09:44.805\nThat's gonna be my email address,\nI'll give it a password,\n\n206\n00:09:44.805 --> 00:09:47.740\nwhich we'll just use a simple password.\n\n207\n00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.450\nI don't need it to be administrator or\nanything, I just need it to have a valid\n\n208\n00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.650\nemail address, so I'm not gonna configure\nanything else, I'll create that.\n\n209\n00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:57.900\nAnd so now I got this\nmeetinginvitations@lab.itprotv.\n\n210\n00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.360\nAnd if I go under Mail,\n\n211\n00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.790\nI can see that it's actually\ncreated a mailbox for that account.\n\n212\n00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.800\nSo I have a valid mailbox, and\nI'm using the Mac mail server.\n\n213\n00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.060\nYou could use a third party mail server.\n\n214\n00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.200\nIt actually doesn't care where it is,\n\n215\n00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.420\ncuz it's just gonna use POP3 to be able to\nconnect to it, or IMAP, it supports both.\n\n216\n00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.930\nSo if I go back to my calendar I can\nchoose to enable invitations, and\n\n217\n00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:25.310\nnow I'm gonna have to set up a mail server\nto be able to connect to, all right?\n\n218\n00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.430\nSo it's verifying my data,\nit's looking for calendar and\n\n219\n00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.690\nmail configurations that\nare already in place.\n\n220\n00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.256\nAnd then it'll let me punch that in and\ntry to be patient.\n\n221\n00:10:33.256 --> 00:10:35.150\nAll right so here's the email address.\n\n222\n00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.720\nNow, it's generating an email address for\nus.\n\n223\n00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:42.143\nDoing com.apple.calendarserver\nblah blah blah.\n\n224\n00:10:42.143 --> 00:10:42.990\nI don't want that.\n\n225\n00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.710\nThe self-generated mailbox is always\nweird that's why I like to create my own.\n\n226\n00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:55.049\nSo, we created\nmeetinginvitations@lab.itpro.tv, I think.\n\n227\n00:10:55.049 --> 00:10:57.465\n[LAUGH] That sounds right,\nmeetinginvitations.\n\n228\n00:10:57.465 --> 00:11:01.600\nSo I'll go ahead and hit Next, and\nnow it's gonna ask for a password.\n\n229\n00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.790\nI can connect via IMAP or\nPOP, doesn't really matter.\n\n230\n00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.660\nIt's not gonna use subfolders or\nanything, so either one will work.\n\n231\n00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.290\nWe'll do IMAP.\n\n232\n00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:14.410\nSo it is osx-server01.lab.itpro.tv\nas my server.\n\n233\n00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:16.850\nI've got my port and\nwhether I wanna use SSL.\n\n234\n00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:18.610\nThis is right here on the same system, so\n\n235\n00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.700\nit doesn't really matter if I use SSL or\nnot.\n\n236\n00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.390\nIn real life when I deal, you'll\nprobably want to use SSL, but again, for\n\n237\n00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.730\nmine it doesn't matter.\n\n238\n00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:32.771\nAnd my user account is\nmeetinginvitations@lab.itprotv and\n\n239\n00:11:32.771 --> 00:11:34.380\nmy password.\n\n240\n00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.140\nAll right, it needs this mailbox so\nthat it can send the invites, but also so\n\n241\n00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.360\nthat it can check and\nsee the responses, right?\n\n242\n00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.660\nSo now the server's gonna\nbe able to check that.\n\n243\n00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.590\nI've got my outgoing mail server\nfrom where I send the invite,\n\n244\n00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.600\nwhat I just did with the incoming,\nso, mine are actually the same.\n\n245\n00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.945\nYour's might not be,\nyou might have different ones.\n\n246\n00:11:50.945 --> 00:11:53.895\nSo you'll have to check that,\nbut we can punch that in.\n\n247\n00:11:53.895 --> 00:11:56.655\nI shouldn't need authentication for\nthis, cuz I'm just sending email.\n\n248\n00:11:56.655 --> 00:12:00.045\nBut if I'm sending to external domains\nthat I may need to authenticate,\n\n249\n00:12:00.045 --> 00:12:02.365\nthen I have a fully valid account,\nso I can come in and\n\n250\n00:12:02.365 --> 00:12:05.185\nspecify that it's not a big issue for me.\n\n251\n00:12:05.185 --> 00:12:09.875\nSo I need to change authentication type,\nwe'll do plain.\n\n252\n00:12:09.875 --> 00:12:13.360\nAnd, again, you probably wanna use SSL,\nhere it's on the same system so\n\n253\n00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.690\nI'm not worried about it.\n\n254\n00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.930\nBut if you're going to a different system,\nyou'll wanna use SSL.\n\n255\n00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.320\nSo we'll punch in that same thing.\n\n256\n00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.794\nA smarter me would've copied this.\n\n257\n00:12:21.794 --> 00:12:23.690\nSo I now have to type it over and\nover again.\n\n258\n00:12:25.738 --> 00:12:26.960\nThere we go, all right.\n\n259\n00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.220\nSo now I can just hit Next on that.\n\n260\n00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.560\nThat should be all\nthe information it needs.\n\n261\n00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.000\nWe can finish that off and\nnow we can send and\n\n262\n00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.160\nreceive those meeting invites\nfrom the server itself.\n\n263\n00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:41.020\nIf we don't set it up on the server and\nyou're using the calendar app on your Mac,\n\n264\n00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.790\nif you have the mail app set up also,\nit'll actually just use your mail app to\n\n265\n00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.460\ndo the same thing and\nyou'll process the meeting invites.\n\n266\n00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.150\nBut that causes problems with\nsome resource accounts and\n\n267\n00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.800\nother things we'll see a little bit later.\n\n268\n00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.160\nBut now that that's set up,\n\n269\n00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.081\nnow we can do invitations by email right\nfrom the server, and we're in business.\n\n270\n00:12:56.081 --> 00:13:00.430\nThat's really it for configuring\nthe calendar server, it's done.\n\n271\n00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:01.580\nIt's ready for end users to use it.\n\n272\n00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.460\nAll right, now before I jump into\nthe end user side of things,\n\n273\n00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.310\nthere is one more thing we\ncan configure if we want to.\n\n274\n00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:13.032\nSpeaking of meetings, when you schedule\na meeting we normally worry about people.\n\n275\n00:13:13.032 --> 00:13:17.360\nI wanna invite Wes to my meeting,\nI wanna invite Megan to my meeting or\n\n276\n00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.890\nsomebody like that, so\nI add them to my little meeting list,\n\n277\n00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.010\nwe invite them and that's it.\n\n278\n00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.560\nThey've all got mailboxes,\nthey get their invitations.\n\n279\n00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.600\nBut sometimes we wanna\nschedule resources also.\n\n280\n00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.630\nSo let's say for example your\ncompany has two conference rooms.\n\n281\n00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:33.992\nAnd so you might wanna book one conference\nroom over another, for some reasons.\n\n282\n00:13:33.992 --> 00:13:37.420\nMaybe one has a better view, I don't know,\none might have more seats, right.\n\n283\n00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.620\nOne might have ten chairs,\nthe other one has four chairs.\n\n284\n00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.240\nI'm gonna have a meeting with six people,\nso I need the one with ten chairs.\n\n285\n00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.150\nWell, how do I make sure that\nmeeting room is not in use when I go\n\n286\n00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.540\nto schedule my meeting?\n\n287\n00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.160\nWe can create what are called resources.\n\n288\n00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.700\nAnd resources are,\nthey're basically mailboxes except\n\n289\n00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.360\nthey're not tied to a person,\nthey're tied to a thing.\n\n290\n00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.260\nAnd we can schedule those resources\nto reserve them for a meeting.\n\n291\n00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.230\nAnd so when I look at my calendar\nsettings, that's actually the last thing\n\n292\n00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.220\ndown here at the bottom of the screen,\nLocations and Resources.\n\n293\n00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.470\nSo I can come in here,\nand I can add things.\n\n294\n00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:11.690\nA meeting room would be a location.\n\n295\n00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.920\nSo that's like a physical place.\n\n296\n00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.040\nA resource would be an object,\nsomething like a projector, or a laptop.\n\n297\n00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.160\nSomething like that,\nthat we might be reserving.\n\n298\n00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.850\nAnd so you can come in and\nspecify that data.\n\n299\n00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:25.600\nSo I might have Conference Room 1,\n\n300\n00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.870\nand I can put the address if I\nhave more than one building.\n\n301\n00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:35.530\nThat way, people will know what building\nit is, if you got a really big campus.\n\n302\n00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.370\nAnd it's doing mailing address validation,\nso\n\n303\n00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.640\nit actually found it right there for me.\n\n304\n00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.710\nAnd so we can pick that and\nsee how it gives me a map now.\n\n305\n00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:49.480\nAnd that way if I invite somebody to this\nmeeting, well eventually that will update,\n\n306\n00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.740\nand it will show the map and\n\n307\n00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:55.480\nthey can use it to navigate and\nfind where that meeting is going to be.\n\n308\n00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.950\nSo we can do that.\n\n309\n00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.080\nYou can set a delegate.\n\n310\n00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.780\nThe delegate is not really\nnecessary by default.\n\n311\n00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.200\nBy default, if somebody wants\nto schedule this meeting room,\n\n312\n00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:09.000\nit shows as available, they can invite it,\nand now it shows as busy, right.\n\n313\n00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.630\nIf somebody goes to invite that meeting\nroom and it's busy, well, they can't.\n\n314\n00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.160\nIt's already busy,\nthat's the default functionality.\n\n315\n00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.550\nBut there's times where you might\nnot want it to be automatic.\n\n316\n00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.320\nLet me give you an example, maybe\nyou've got a guy down in the mail room.\n\n317\n00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.010\nSo John down in the mail room,\n\n318\n00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:26.300\nhe books the nicest conference room\navailable at a particular time.\n\n319\n00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.130\nAnd then later that day the CEO\nwants to book that same room.\n\n320\n00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.724\nSo Alice, the CEO, comes in and\nsays, I need that for a meeting.\n\n321\n00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:35.960\nAnd they're like sorry, John down\nin the mail room's already got it.\n\n322\n00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.960\nWell, we have priorities,\nthe CEO takes priority.\n\n323\n00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.700\nSo we might wanna control who is\nallowed to invite those rooms.\n\n324\n00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.225\nSo the easiest way to do\nthat is to set a delegate,\n\n325\n00:15:46.225 --> 00:15:48.082\nwe can put somebody in charge of it.\n\n326\n00:15:48.082 --> 00:15:51.832\nThis is the person who can view and\nmanage the resource and\n\n327\n00:15:51.832 --> 00:15:56.366\nthen change it to instead of saying\nAccept if Free, Decline if Busy,\n\n328\n00:15:56.366 --> 00:15:59.514\nto change it to say\nRequire Delegate Approval.\n\n329\n00:15:59.514 --> 00:16:04.059\nNow, anybody trying to reserve the room\nwill have to be approved by whoever\n\n330\n00:16:04.059 --> 00:16:05.730\nI specify as the Delegate.\n\n331\n00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:10.452\nSo I can set a Delegate and\nI can make it me, or Wes, or whoever.\n\n332\n00:16:10.452 --> 00:16:13.080\nSo, I'll be the Delegate on this one,\nright.\n\n333\n00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.170\nAnd you can set an Accept Group.\n\n334\n00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:19.420\nThis says, if somebody in this particular\ngroup goes to invite this meeting,\n\n335\n00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.650\nalways approve them.\n\n336\n00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:24.710\nSo, for example, the executives, I might\ncreate an executives group for the CEO and\n\n337\n00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.850\nthe vice presidents, and if they want\na room, they're always going to get it.\n\n338\n00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.470\nI would punch in that group name here.\n\n339\n00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.990\n>> Now, Don,\nsetting yourself as the Delegate,\n\n340\n00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:35.850\ndoes that mean any time somebody goes\nto reserve this resource you're gonna\n\n341\n00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.540\nget an email as to whether you're\ngonna approve it or deny it.\n\n342\n00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.610\n>> Yep, that's exactly it.\n\n343\n00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.110\nAnd if I don't approve it or\ndeny it, it just sits there and\n\n344\n00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.890\nthey don't get the room.\n\n345\n00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.500\nSo now,\nI've put myself in the line of fire.\n\n346\n00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.790\nI've gotta be involved in it.\n\n347\n00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.680\nIf I take myself back out,\nlet me just bump myself out here, and\n\n348\n00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.340\nI switch this drop down box, you'll see\nthere's several different modes, right?\n\n349\n00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:59.050\nLike, Accept Invitations If Free, Require\nDelegate Approval, Accept All Invitations.\n\n350\n00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.257\nThat allows you to double or\neven triple book a conference.\n\n351\n00:17:01.257 --> 00:17:03.056\nIt won't stop you from doing that.\n\n352\n00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:06.900\nSo, the normal method we want is\nAccept If Free, Decline If Busy.\n\n353\n00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.250\nThat makes the room a first come,\nfirst serve type room.\n\n354\n00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:10.860\nWhoever asks for\n\n355\n00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:15.420\nit first gets it, everybody else is\ngonna have to pick a different time.\n\n356\n00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.310\nAll right, so I'll go ahead and\ncreate that one.\n\n357\n00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.970\nSo there's Conference Room 1.\n\n358\n00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.930\nNow I can go in and\nI can create other conference rooms,\n\n359\n00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.950\nmaybe I need Conference Room 2.\n\n360\n00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:26.940\nAnd the other options that I put in\nlike Address and Delegate and all that,\n\n361\n00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:27.920\nthat's all optional.\n\n362\n00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.470\nThe Name's really all you have to have,\nand\n\n363\n00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.120\nyou can hit Create and\nyou got another conference room, right?\n\n364\n00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.100\nSo each of those are locations\nthat we'll be able to book.\n\n365\n00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.310\nWe can do other types of objects,\nbut these are the most common.\n\n366\n00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:42.263\n>> What if I have, Don, maybe,\nlike say, a series of rooms,\n\n367\n00:17:42.263 --> 00:17:44.402\nmaybe we've got four rooms in a building.\n\n368\n00:17:44.402 --> 00:17:49.180\nThat's obviously a location, but only one\nof those rooms has a projector in it.\n\n369\n00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:52.230\nCan we do something like that where we\nsay, okay, well, this room has a projector\n\n370\n00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:55.548\nand we make a resource or\nan object to reserve the projector itself?\n\n371\n00:17:55.548 --> 00:17:58.320\n>> So\nif the projector were permanent to a room,\n\n372\n00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.960\nmaybe it's installed in\nthe ceiling in Conference Room 1.\n\n373\n00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.290\nThen you'd probably just want to add it\nto the name of the conference room or\n\n374\n00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:04.378\nits description, right?\n\n375\n00:18:04.378 --> 00:18:08.390\nIf you edit it, actually,\nyou don't have a description field do you.\n\n376\n00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:09.490\nYeah, it hides that.\n\n377\n00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.622\nWell, there is a description field,\nyou just can't see it so\n\n378\n00:18:11.622 --> 00:18:12.649\nit doesn't help your users.\n\n379\n00:18:12.649 --> 00:18:14.054\nSo, you can put it in the Name.\n\n380\n00:18:14.054 --> 00:18:18.775\nFor example, I can change conference\nroom one to have a name like that so\n\n381\n00:18:18.775 --> 00:18:23.353\nthat people recognize,\nthat's the room that has a projector.\n\n382\n00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:27.160\nAnd so when they go to book a room,\nI wanna pick Conference Room 1.\n\n383\n00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.650\nI've seen a lot of people where\nthey put the number of seats.\n\n384\n00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.210\nLike this is a ten person room or a five\nperson room so you can recognize that and\n\n385\n00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:34.480\npick appropriately.\n\n386\n00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.540\nBut if the projector is portable, like\nmaybe we can move it from room to room,\n\n387\n00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.560\nwe can book the projector separately.\n\n388\n00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.470\nMaybe I need Conference Room 1,\nbut I don't need the projector.\n\n389\n00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.980\nOr I need Conference room 2 and\nI do need the projector.\n\n390\n00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.453\nI'm gonna take it out of the name here, so\n\n391\n00:18:48.453 --> 00:18:51.288\nthis is just a regular\nold conference room now.\n\n392\n00:18:51.288 --> 00:18:55.255\nAnd, I'll create a separate resource\njust for that projector; so\n\n393\n00:18:55.255 --> 00:18:58.250\ninstead of doing a Location,\nI can do a Resource.\n\n394\n00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:02.430\nSo when I go and hit the plus sign,\nI created a Location a moment ago,\n\n395\n00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.030\nthis time I can do a Resource.\n\n396\n00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:07.030\nAnd really, the only difference,\nyou'll see that Address disappeared.\n\n397\n00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.890\nThere's no Address for a Resource.\n\n398\n00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:13.230\nAnd so I can call this Projector 1, or\nthis is the projector, or whatever.\n\n399\n00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.260\nAnd I could set Delegates and booking.\n\n400\n00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.800\nI'll leave it at the default,\nthe first come, first serve and\n\n401\n00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.800\nit's got the Accept Group.\n\n402\n00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.003\nSame settings as a Location and\nwhen I create that, now,\n\n403\n00:19:22.003 --> 00:19:25.697\nI've got a projector resource\nthat could be booked separately.\n\n404\n00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:29.597\nAnd so, I can book Conference Room 2 and\nthe projector, or\n\n405\n00:19:29.597 --> 00:19:32.176\nConference Room 1 and the Projector.\n\n406\n00:19:32.176 --> 00:19:36.280\nAnd if somebody else needs the project,\nthey'll see that's it's busy at that time.\n\n407\n00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.970\nSo, it's kind of a neat little function\nthat we can set up right there\n\n408\n00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.120\non the Calendar server.\n\n409\n00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.040\nNow, we've literally seen everything\nwe can configure on the server.\n\n410\n00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.140\nThere is nothing for\nus to tweak here on the server.\n\n411\n00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.440\nEverything else is done on the client\nside, it's done by our end users.\n\n412\n00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.128\nThey connect to the Calendar server and\nthey start to set up resources and\n\n413\n00:19:54.128 --> 00:19:55.960\nother things to be able to use them.\n\n414\n00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.830\nSo, let's take a look at that, right?\n\n415\n00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.977\nI'm gonna jump over to a client, and\n\n416\n00:19:59.977 --> 00:20:03.457\nthis is the client that we used\nin the email server episode.\n\n417\n00:20:03.457 --> 00:20:06.350\nSo, I'm logged in with my\nopen directory account and\n\n418\n00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:10.625\nI've got the mail client set up, but\nI don't have the calendar set up.\n\n419\n00:20:10.625 --> 00:20:12.255\nSo if I fire up the Calendar app,\n\n420\n00:20:12.255 --> 00:20:17.155\nwhen I launch that,\nI'm gonna see the default local calendar.\n\n421\n00:20:17.155 --> 00:20:19.045\nNow, how do I know it's\nthe local calendar?\n\n422\n00:20:19.045 --> 00:20:23.038\nWell, if I click the Calendar's button up\ntop, it'll show me what I'm connected to.\n\n423\n00:20:23.038 --> 00:20:26.621\nAnd by default,\nyou've got two calendars, Home and Work,\n\n424\n00:20:26.621 --> 00:20:28.809\nand they're both on my Mac, right?\n\n425\n00:20:28.809 --> 00:20:30.420\nIn other words, they're right here.\n\n426\n00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.460\nThey're not in iCloud.\n\n427\n00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.010\nThey're not on a central server.\n\n428\n00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.050\nThey're right here on this machine.\n\n429\n00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.700\nIf I start creating stuff here,\nnobody else sees it.\n\n430\n00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.480\nIt's just here on mine.\n\n431\n00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.450\nThat's not what I want.\n\n432\n00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.170\nI want to connect to the server.\n\n433\n00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:47.240\nSo to connect to the server, you can\ngo up top to Calendar and Add Account.\n\n434\n00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.100\nAnd so I'm gonna add an account.\n\n435\n00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.250\nAnd it's got iCloud, Exchange,\nall the big providers.\n\n436\n00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:56.990\nWe need to do Other CalDav Account, right,\nso we actually see that CalDav name,\n\n437\n00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.330\nso we spot that protocol.\n\n438\n00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:00.910\nAnd now I can provide it the information.\n\n439\n00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.790\nNow we can leave\nthe Account Type as Automatic.\n\n440\n00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:03.940\nYou can do Manual.\n\n441\n00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.440\nIt's gonna try and\nautomatically discover the server.\n\n442\n00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.270\nIt usually fails, so if you go Manual,\nyou can just type the server name,\n\n443\n00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:10.239\nsaves you a little time.\n\n444\n00:21:10.239 --> 00:21:13.942\nSo I'm gonna connect, I'm donpezet@,\nwait, this is me, right?\n\n445\n00:21:13.942 --> 00:21:15.835\nYeah, making sure I'm\nnot logged in as Wes.\n\n446\n00:21:15.835 --> 00:21:22.050\nSo, donpezet@lab.itpro.tv, and\nI'll punch in my password.\n\n447\n00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:25.300\nAnd I'll punch in the server address.\n\n448\n00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.210\nSo that will be everything it needs\nto know to connect to that server.\n\n449\n00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.470\nAnd I'm gonna hit Sign In.\n\n450\n00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:33.620\nNow, the sign in process can take\na little bit of time the first time.\n\n451\n00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.010\nWhich apparently it's\ngonna connect really fast.\n\n452\n00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:37.343\nBut, sometimes it can take a little while.\n\n453\n00:21:37.343 --> 00:21:38.990\nYou'll see the gears spin for a moment.\n\n454\n00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.500\nJust wait a second and it'll connect.\n\n455\n00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.930\nMine went really fast.\n\n456\n00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:45.280\nBut when you're connected,\nyou'll see a new calendar appear.\n\n457\n00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.060\nSee how I've got lab.ITpro.TV,\nand there's the calendar.\n\n458\n00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.540\nThat's the centralized calendar,\nthe one that's stored on the server.\n\n459\n00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.540\nAnd I know it's remote, cuz it's\ngot the little Wi-Fi signal on it.\n\n460\n00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.350\nJust letting me know\nit's a remote calendar.\n\n461\n00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:58.627\nThis one's on the server.\n\n462\n00:21:58.627 --> 00:22:01.238\nSo now,\nwhenever I create a new calendar item,\n\n463\n00:22:01.238 --> 00:22:03.341\nI can put it on that central calendar.\n\n464\n00:22:03.341 --> 00:22:04.687\nIt can be on that server.\n\n465\n00:22:04.687 --> 00:22:07.690\nSo if I go in here, and\nI'll create a new event.\n\n466\n00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:14.352\nAnd so maybe it's our Apple Show, and\nI'm gonna schedule it for today from,\n\n467\n00:22:14.352 --> 00:22:19.375\nlet's go like, 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, okay.\n\n468\n00:22:19.375 --> 00:22:24.100\nSo, from 1:00 to 5:00, I'm gonna schedule\nthis Apple Show, and I need to be careful\n\n469\n00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:28.480\nhere, cuz when I schedule it, it's picking\nto schedule it on that central calendar,\n\n470\n00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.900\nbecause that was what I had highlighted.\n\n471\n00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.220\nIf I had a different calendar highlighted,\nit would be defaulting to it, so\n\n472\n00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.800\nI've got the little box up here where\nI can pick which calendar I'm about to\n\n473\n00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.780\ncreate this on, and\nI've got it on my name,\n\n474\n00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.380\nso you gotta make sure you\nchoose the right calendar.\n\n475\n00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.790\nSo I've got that set, and\nthen I can invite people to the meeting.\n\n476\n00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:49.630\nAnd so,\nI might want to invite somebody like Wes.\n\n477\n00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:54.025\nAnd if you just start typing their name\nit'll look them up against the server and\n\n478\n00:22:54.025 --> 00:22:54.775\nit should find them.\n\n479\n00:22:54.775 --> 00:22:56.625\nAnd so I see Wes right there.\n\n480\n00:22:56.625 --> 00:22:57.925\nI can pick him.\n\n481\n00:22:57.925 --> 00:22:59.515\nAnd so now it's got him, and\n\n482\n00:22:59.515 --> 00:23:02.625\na little check mark cuz I'm\ngonna invite him to my meeting.\n\n483\n00:23:02.625 --> 00:23:04.975\nAnd I can invite things\nlike the conference room.\n\n484\n00:23:04.975 --> 00:23:08.970\nSo if I wanna invite the conference room,\nI can actually go up here to Add Location.\n\n485\n00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:12.200\nAnd if I just start typing it'll\ndo a lookup against the server and\n\n486\n00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.980\nI can start to see the conference rooms,\nright?\n\n487\n00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.290\nThere's my conference rooms as well as\nother suggestions in the near area.\n\n488\n00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.450\nSo I'm gonna book Conference Room 1 for\nthis.\n\n489\n00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.150\nAnd so you'd pick it just\nlike you would a person.\n\n490\n00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.740\nSo I'm inviting Wes,\nI'm inviting the Conference Room,\n\n491\n00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:29.950\nI'm inviting myself cuz I'm\ncreating this so I have to do that.\n\n492\n00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:32.519\nAnd then I can go ahead and just hit Send.\n\n493\n00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:37.930\nAll right, so now I've created\nthe meeting, the meeting is on the central\n\n494\n00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:41.210\ncalendar, and I've invited Wes and\nthe Conference Room, right?\n\n495\n00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:44.882\nNow Wes will get a notification,\nan invitation, so\n\n496\n00:23:44.882 --> 00:23:49.065\nhe'll see that and be able to accept or\ndecline it, right?\n\n497\n00:23:49.065 --> 00:23:52.110\nNow, Wes is gonna see\nthat invitation two ways.\n\n498\n00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:55.470\nHe's going to get it via email\nbecause we set up email invitation.\n\n499\n00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.916\nBut he is also going to get\nit in the calendar app.\n\n500\n00:23:57.916 --> 00:24:02.465\nIf he's got a calendar connected directly\nto this, if he's internal to my network,\n\n501\n00:24:02.465 --> 00:24:05.450\nhe'll get a notification\nright through the calendar.\n\n502\n00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:07.730\nBut for people outside our network,\nthey have to get it via email.\n\n503\n00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.500\nBut our internal people\nactually get it both ways, so\n\n504\n00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.300\nit depends on which way Wes sees it first.\n\n505\n00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.110\nHe might see it via email first, or\n\n506\n00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:17.430\nhe might see it via the calendar app\nfirst, and he can accept in either place.\n\n507\n00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:19.460\nSo I'm going to switch over to Wes.\n\n508\n00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:23.470\nNow for Wes, I need to get him\nconnected to that calendar.\n\n509\n00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:26.400\nAnd I talked a little bit about\nthis in the mail episode,\n\n510\n00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.800\nthat if your using the Profile Manager.\n\n511\n00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.615\nThe Profile Manager can push out\nthe settings for the calendar app for us.\n\n512\n00:24:32.615 --> 00:24:37.795\nSo, like I've got the profile\nmanager set up somewhere, here.\n\n513\n00:24:37.795 --> 00:24:40.765\nAnd if you go into settings for everyone,\n\n514\n00:24:40.765 --> 00:24:44.227\nsee how it's pushing out the calendar\nsettings alongside the email settings?\n\n515\n00:24:44.227 --> 00:24:47.737\nSo, it's gonna push those out to all my\npeople to set up their calendar for us.\n\n516\n00:24:47.737 --> 00:24:50.687\nThe problem is it can take\na little bit of time.\n\n517\n00:24:50.687 --> 00:24:54.157\nSo it might be a few hours before\nWes's machines takes that into affect.\n\n518\n00:24:54.157 --> 00:24:57.204\nSo I don't know if Wes is gonna be\nautomatically configured for that or not.\n\n519\n00:24:57.204 --> 00:24:59.060\nSo, I'm gonna fire up the calendar, and\n\n520\n00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.778\nI'm not gonna be surprised if\nhe's not set up and he isn't.\n\n521\n00:25:01.778 --> 00:25:04.777\nIf I wait long enough,\nit will automatically set that up, and\n\n522\n00:25:04.777 --> 00:25:07.448\nthen he'll just go right\ninto his calendar.\n\n523\n00:25:07.448 --> 00:25:09.438\nBut we'll manually add it\nhere just to save time.\n\n524\n00:25:09.438 --> 00:25:13.108\nI'm gonna double check and make sure the\ncalendar's not showing up an dit isn't.\n\n525\n00:25:13.108 --> 00:25:18.338\nSo, I'll add an account here,\nand we'll do a cal dave account,\n\n526\n00:25:18.338 --> 00:25:21.439\nand I'll go manual and\nI'm just gonna log in as Wes on this one.\n\n527\n00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:27.210\nAnd I'll try and get the information\nright, so that it actually works.\n\n528\n00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:30.900\nAnd this is just the same data except for\nhis account, right,\n\n529\n00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.240\nto be able to connect to the server.\n\n530\n00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:36.970\nAll right, so that's gonna connect,\nthere he gets that lab.\n\n531\n00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:39.010\nI produced central calendar, all right.\n\n532\n00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:44.120\nSo notice how as soon as I logged in, he\ngot a little notification number, right.\n\n533\n00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.360\nAnd up here on the notifications,\nhe's been invited to the Apple show and\n\n534\n00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.250\nhe can accept or decline.\n\n535\n00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:50.690\nSo I'm going to accept it.\n\n536\n00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.580\nAnd I did all that without going to email.\n\n537\n00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.590\nBut he would get an email notification\nalso, because we had both set up,\n\n538\n00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.035\nfor insurance internal employees.\n\n539\n00:25:58.035 --> 00:26:00.575\nExternal people would just get the email.\n\n540\n00:26:00.575 --> 00:26:03.945\nAll right, so he’s now accepted and\nhe’s got a meeting on the calendar.\n\n541\n00:26:03.945 --> 00:26:07.055\nNow, maybe Wes wants to\nschedule a meeting also.\n\n542\n00:26:07.055 --> 00:26:08.475\nAnd so he goes to add an event.\n\n543\n00:26:08.475 --> 00:26:10.625\nNow I’m gonna click on\nthe central calendar to make sure\n\n544\n00:26:10.625 --> 00:26:11.990\nI create the event there.\n\n545\n00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:15.890\nAnd I'll click on the 19th, to create\nan event just like I did a moment ago.\n\n546\n00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.090\nNow when he goes to create this meeting,\n\n547\n00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.430\nmaybe it's just some\nkind of status briefing.\n\n548\n00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:30.320\nSo we'll do status briefing, and he's\ngonna schedule it from 12PM to 2PM today.\n\n549\n00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:35.720\nAnd when he goes to add a location,\nlike a conference room, he could go and,\n\n550\n00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:40.160\nsee how Conference Room 1 has an X by it,\nbut Conference 2 still has a check.\n\n551\n00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.150\nIt can see that Conference Room\n1 is busy during that time.\n\n552\n00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.040\nSomebody else already has it booked.\n\n553\n00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.500\nHe could choose Conference Room 2,\nand it's open.\n\n554\n00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:54.090\nBut maybe he really wanted conference room\none, because it's got extra chairs or\n\n555\n00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.030\nit's got a projector or something.\n\n556\n00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:59.120\nHe can look at that and say,\nooh I need to move my meeting.\n\n557\n00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.840\nI need to move the meeting to a different\ntime, so I can get that room.\n\n558\n00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.940\nBut he gets that notification, that's one\nof the big advantages of a centralized\n\n559\n00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.790\ncalendar is you can see this stuff.\n\n560\n00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:12.530\nYou can see the information, and know\nthat it's busy and pick the right time.\n\n561\n00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:15.940\nIt's really cool when you do it for\npeople, whoops or\n\n562\n00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.190\nyou kill the whole event like I just did.\n\n563\n00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:21.940\nSo let me recreate that,\nand I'll put that back from\n\n564\n00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:27.600\nnoon to 2 with people, so if he goes\nto add an invitee, and he adds me.\n\n565\n00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.090\nSo here's me,\nhe's gonna add me to the meeting.\n\n566\n00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:31.370\nNow, I'm busy also.\n\n567\n00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:33.580\nSo see how I get the little x by my name?\n\n568\n00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:37.030\nSo he can't invite me to the meeting\ncuz I'm busy during that time.\n\n569\n00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:41.500\nIf he hits Check Availability,\nthat'll open up the scheduling planner.\n\n570\n00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.760\nAnd when the scheduling planner comes up,\n\n571\n00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:48.900\nwhat he's gonna see is his schedule and\nmy schedule and\n\n572\n00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.710\nthe conference room schedules and anybody\nelse that's been invited to the thing.\n\n573\n00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:56.490\nAnd he's gonna see when they're available,\nall right.\n\n574\n00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:59.740\nSo he can look at this and say,\nall right, I want to invite Don And\n\n575\n00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:04.460\nlooking at Don, well he's open in\nthe morning but it's already passed.\n\n576\n00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.080\nThat's why it's this kind of light pink\narea, and we don't want to schedule there.\n\n577\n00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.310\nThen we hit noon to two, and\nthat's what I'm trying to schedule.\n\n578\n00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.170\nAnd see these gray bars?\n\n579\n00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:17.990\nThat's when we're busy, so\nwe're busy during this time.\n\n580\n00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:20.040\nI'm overlapping with that and\nthat's a problem.\n\n581\n00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.290\nSo what do I do?\n\n582\n00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:23.350\nWell I can take the meeting.\n\n583\n00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:24.710\nAnd I can move it.\n\n584\n00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:28.850\nI can move it forward in time and\nhave it start here, and\n\n585\n00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:33.680\nnow I'm not overlapping, or\nI can move it back in time to try and\n\n586\n00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.390\nschedule later but\nI'm getting passed our Work close hours.\n\n587\n00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.310\nSo I'm just gonna move\nit forward like that.\n\n588\n00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:41.080\nAnd so now, it's available.\n\n589\n00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.750\nMaybe I need to move it to tomorrow.\n\n590\n00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:46.790\nAnd so we can just hit tomorrow, and\nnow we've got plenty of availability.\n\n591\n00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:47.290\nSo all right.\n\n592\n00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:48.290\nWell, we're too busy today.\n\n593\n00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:49.480\nLet's put it tomorrow.\n\n594\n00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.940\nAnd we're both free tomorrow afternoon,\nso we can schedule that or\n\n595\n00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.150\nyou can just set next available time,\n\n596\n00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:58.070\nit will find the best time possible for\neverybody you've invited.\n\n597\n00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.930\nWe're just two people.\n\n598\n00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:00.050\nIt's not a big deal.\n\n599\n00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:02.220\nBut if you try to invite\n30 people to a meeting,\n\n600\n00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:05.680\nit is really difficult to find\na time where everybody's available.\n\n601\n00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.670\nThis is it's a great way to find that.\n\n602\n00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:12.260\nAnd so now when you hit done, it's gonna\nautomatically change the meeting date, and\n\n603\n00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.210\nnow we can send it.\n\n604\n00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:16.130\nSo this'll be my All Hands Meeting.\n\n605\n00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:21.340\nAnd he can send it,\neverybody's invited, everybody's happy.\n\n606\n00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.140\nNow people just have to\naccept the invitation.\n\n607\n00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:26.410\nAnd if I switch back to my account, I\nshould have an invitation waiting for me.\n\n608\n00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.210\nBecause we turned on push\nnotifications I don't have to wait.\n\n609\n00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:31.110\nIt should already be lit up.\n\n610\n00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:33.120\nAnd, yep.\nI missed my notification,\n\n611\n00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.770\nbecause it happened so fast, but I've got\na little number one on my calendar here.\n\n612\n00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:38.800\nThere it is.\n\n613\n00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:39.830\nYep.\nAnd I can accept.\n\n614\n00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:41.100\nAnd now I'm in that meeting too.\n\n615\n00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:41.820\nAll right.\nSo\n\n616\n00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.880\nall this being handled by that\ncentralized calendar service.\n\n617\n00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.310\nPretty neat stuff.\n\n618\n00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:47.890\nWas it hard to set up?\n\n619\n00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:49.370\nNah, it's really easy.\n\n620\n00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:51.910\nWe just turn the stuff on and\nyou're in business.\n\n621\n00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.850\nIt's one of the cooler\ncollaboration services.\n\n622\n00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:59.220\n>> Well, it looks like we're ready to do a\nlittle bit of collaborating here now, Don.\n\n623\n00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.730\nA lot of great information.\n\n624\n00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.860\nLooking at the clock, it does look like\nwe're about ready to wrap this one up.\n\n625\n00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.360\nBut before we do,\ndo you have any additional words?\n\n626\n00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.090\nThat's about it.\n\n627\n00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:10.360\nI can't stress enough how important\nit is to back up the calendar server.\n\n628\n00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.300\nYou really need to back it up,\nbecause if you lose the server you've\n\n629\n00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.220\njust lost the centralized calender\nthat you're telling everyone to use.\n\n630\n00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:19.280\nAlso, make sure you educate your users,\nthat when they create a calendar item that\n\n631\n00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.870\nthey need to create it in that\ncentral calendar, not in their own.\n\n632\n00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.060\nSo that it'll actually\nreside on the server.\n\n633\n00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:28.210\nThey can still maintain their own private\ncalendar if they want, for personal stuff.\n\n634\n00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:30.570\nBut all the business stuff needs\nto go on that central calendar,\n\n635\n00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:32.440\nit's all about user education there.\n\n636\n00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.930\n>> Well, we thank you for\nthat information.\n\n637\n00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:35.890\nAnd we do thank you,\nthe viewer, for watching.\n\n638\n00:30:35.890

00:00:16.113\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.113 --> 00:00:19.419\nAnd in today's episode, we're\ncontinuing through our series on OS X s\n\n5\n00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:23.071\nServer Essentials and we're coming\nback with more collaborative services.\n\n6\n00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:25.552\nIn this episode,\nwe're gonna be talking about contacts and\n\n7\n00:00:25.552 --> 00:00:28.192\njoining me in the studio today is\nnone other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:28.192 --> 00:00:29.332\nDon, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:29.332 --> 00:00:30.194\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:30.194 --> 00:00:32.627\nReady to jump right back into\ncollaborative services and\n\n11\n00:00:32.627 --> 00:00:34.104\nmuch like Jodie Foster found out.\n\n12\n00:00:34.104 --> 00:00:36.498\nIf we want to reach out and talk to\nsomebody, we've got to make contact.\n\n13\n00:00:36.498 --> 00:00:37.462\nAnd in this episode,\n\n14\n00:00:37.462 --> 00:00:40.471\nwe're gonna look at the contact\nservice as part of the server app.\n\n15\n00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:44.047\nThis one's not one of the glamorous\nservices that's gonna blow your mind with\n\n16\n00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:47.801\namazement, but it is a very functional,\nvery useful service that is built-in.\n\n17\n00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:51.280\nBecause we talk about collaboration,\nwe talked about sending email or\n\n18\n00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.675\nchat messages or whatever.\n\n19\n00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:55.696\nIn order to chat with somebody or\nin order to send somebody an email,\n\n20\n00:00:55.696 --> 00:00:57.711\nyou have to know their\ncontact information.\n\n21\n00:00:57.711 --> 00:01:00.188\nYou have to know their email address or\nXNP address or\n\n22\n00:01:00.188 --> 00:01:03.370\nwhatever it is that you're\ngonna use to talk to them with.\n\n23\n00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.240\nSo, how do you find that out?\n\n24\n00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.175\nThere's the old fashioned what,\nwhich is you ask them,\n\n25\n00:01:08.175 --> 00:01:10.759\nwhich is nice if they're\nright there in the room.\n\n26\n00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.735\nSo hey, Wes, what's your email address?\n\n27\n00:01:12.735 --> 00:01:14.280\nI can find out, right, he's right here.\n\n28\n00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.360\nBut what if it's somebody, I might\nwork with a company with 5,000 people,\n\n29\n00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.560\nI haven't met all 5,000 people and some\nof them might be in different states or\n\n30\n00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.016\neven different countries.\n\n31\n00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:27.618\nSo I can't just ask them in the hallway,\nI can call them on the phone, but\n\n32\n00:01:27.618 --> 00:01:29.466\nnow I gotta know their phone number.\n\n33\n00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:33.169\nSo one way or another, I've gotta be able\nto find the people to then communicate\n\n34\n00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:35.837\nwith them and\nthe contact service is what provides that.\n\n35\n00:01:35.837 --> 00:01:39.888\nNow, the primary purpose of\nthe contact service is to create\n\n36\n00:01:39.888 --> 00:01:43.793\na centralized directory of\nour employees and their data.\n\n37\n00:01:43.793 --> 00:01:46.875\nAnd by their data,\nI mean their name, email address,\n\n38\n00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:49.825\nmaybe phone number,\nother information like that.\n\n39\n00:01:49.825 --> 00:01:51.662\nThe stuff you have on a business card.\n\n40\n00:01:51.662 --> 00:01:55.677\nNow I know what you might be thinking is\nwell, doesn't the Open Directory do that?\n\n41\n00:01:55.677 --> 00:01:58.481\nWe can have an Open Directory and we can\nhave all of our user accounts in there,\n\n42\n00:01:58.481 --> 00:02:01.026\nand it would have all their name,\nand address, and phone number, and\n\n43\n00:02:01.026 --> 00:02:02.780\nwe could pull it right\nfrom the open directory.\n\n44\n00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.315\nAnd you're absolutely right,\nwe certainly could.\n\n45\n00:02:04.315 --> 00:02:08.841\nIn fact, if you watched our episode\nthat we did on the email server and\n\n46\n00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:14.006\non the calendar server, we did that\nwithout having the contact server set up.\n\n47\n00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:16.942\nWe were able to create meetings and\nsend emails, and\n\n48\n00:02:16.942 --> 00:02:19.086\nwe did it all through Open Directory.\n\n49\n00:02:19.086 --> 00:02:22.778\nSo, open Directory can take\nthe place of the contact server or\n\n50\n00:02:22.778 --> 00:02:26.290\ncontact server can take\nthe place of open directory.\n\n51\n00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.957\nOpen Directory provides authentication.\n\n52\n00:02:27.957 --> 00:02:29.353\nWhat if I don't care about authentication?\n\n53\n00:02:29.353 --> 00:02:32.560\nWhat if I don't wanna bind people's\nmachines to my Open Directory?\n\n54\n00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.775\nI don't want that.\nEverybody has their own\n\n55\n00:02:33.775 --> 00:02:34.663\nindependent machines.\n\n56\n00:02:34.663 --> 00:02:38.242\nI can setup a contact server,\nhave everybody's accounts right there\n\n57\n00:02:38.242 --> 00:02:43.140\ncentralized and people can find that\ndata without being bound to our network.\n\n58\n00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.179\nBut most commonly, you use them both.\n\n59\n00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:48.591\nYou use them both together,\nbecause they are very functional and\n\n60\n00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:51.940\nit does make a lot of sense, so\nyou can have the Open Directory and\n\n61\n00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.288\nyou can have the contact service\nboth running at the same time and\n\n62\n00:02:55.288 --> 00:02:57.978\nnow that's much easier to\nfind people resources.\n\n63\n00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:00.233\nSo, let's take a look at how this works.\n\n64\n00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:03.594\nThe contact service itself\nis pretty easy to get setup,\n\n65\n00:03:03.594 --> 00:03:06.320\nit's one of those that\nis not just very hard.\n\n66\n00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.437\nWe've already seen calendar and mail in\nsome of the other episodes and so on.\n\n67\n00:03:10.437 --> 00:03:12.079\nSo on this one,\nwe're taking a look at contacts.\n\n68\n00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.308\nAnd if I click on it, you'll see that\nthere's not a whole lot of options.\n\n69\n00:03:16.308 --> 00:03:18.911\nWe've got the permissions that we\nsee on pretty much every server.\n\n70\n00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:20.470\nSo, whose allowed to contact?\n\n71\n00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.334\nAnd then after that,\nwe've got our push notification and\n\n72\n00:03:23.334 --> 00:03:27.494\nnotice my push notifications are already\nenabled and that's cuz we turned them on.\n\n73\n00:03:27.494 --> 00:03:32.485\nIn one of the episodes, either the nail\nepisode or the calendar episode.\n\n74\n00:03:32.485 --> 00:03:34.461\nYou turn it on for one service,\nit turns it on for all of them.\n\n75\n00:03:34.461 --> 00:03:37.064\nSo, that's the push\nnotifications through Apple.\n\n76\n00:03:37.064 --> 00:03:40.294\nSo really,\nthe only option I have here is this one.\n\n77\n00:03:40.294 --> 00:03:44.311\nAllow users to search the directory\nusing Contacts application.\n\n78\n00:03:44.311 --> 00:03:45.612\nWhat's that?\n\n79\n00:03:45.612 --> 00:03:49.986\nWell, by default,\nthe contact service has a separate\n\n80\n00:03:49.986 --> 00:03:53.800\nlist of user accounts\nthan the Open Directory.\n\n81\n00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.379\nThey're two separate things,\n\n82\n00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.182\nbecause the contact service can operate\nindependent of the Open Directory.\n\n83\n00:03:59.182 --> 00:04:00.532\nI don't even have to\nhave an open directory.\n\n84\n00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:05.750\nI can go shut that service off and\njust do contacts, and it ran just fine.\n\n85\n00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.356\nBut if I wanna run both\nof them simultaneously,\n\n86\n00:04:08.356 --> 00:04:11.297\nit's a good idea to check\nthis little box right here.\n\n87\n00:04:11.297 --> 00:04:14.962\nAnd what that says is if somebody\nconnects to the contacts server and\n\n88\n00:04:14.962 --> 00:04:18.949\nthey do a search, it'll search all\nthe contacts in the contact server and\n\n89\n00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:21.613\nit'll search everybody\nin the open directory.\n\n90\n00:04:21.613 --> 00:04:23.566\nSo now, they are truly merged together.\n\n91\n00:04:23.566 --> 00:04:27.188\nI get it all right here in one place and\nthings kind of operate the way we want.\n\n92\n00:04:27.188 --> 00:04:29.395\nIf I don't have an Open Directory,\nI don't need to check this.\n\n93\n00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:31.070\nI can ignore it and everything is fine.\n\n94\n00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.994\nSo kinda up to me on how\nI wanna go on that, but\n\n95\n00:04:32.994 --> 00:04:34.660\nusually we're gonna wanna check it.\n\n96\n00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.675\nBut that's the only real\noption I've got here and\n\n97\n00:04:38.675 --> 00:04:43.940\nonce that's set, I can turn it on and\nI've got a contact server.\n\n98\n00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.118\nSo, what just happened in the background\nsince obviously something had to happen\n\n99\n00:04:47.118 --> 00:04:48.233\nthat we couldn't see here?\n\n100\n00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:49.211\nSo, what happened?\n\n101\n00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:53.116\nWell, the contact service started and\nwhat the contact\n\n102\n00:04:53.116 --> 00:04:57.943\nservice is is it's actually built\noff of something called CardDAV.\n\n103\n00:04:57.943 --> 00:05:02.347\nCardDAV is card distributed authoring and\nversioning, that should sound familiar.\n\n104\n00:05:02.347 --> 00:05:04.783\nWhen we talked about the web server,\nwe talked about WebDAV.\n\n105\n00:05:04.783 --> 00:05:08.578\nWeb Distributed Authoring and Versioning\nwhere somebody could connect and\n\n106\n00:05:08.578 --> 00:05:10.947\nedit files, and\npush data up to the server, and\n\n107\n00:05:10.947 --> 00:05:14.342\ndo all that via their web browser,\nand we saw that with Wikkis also.\n\n108\n00:05:14.342 --> 00:05:17.608\nAnd then when we got the calendars,\nthere was CalDAV,\n\n109\n00:05:17.608 --> 00:05:21.163\nwhich was A modified version\nof WebDAV used for calendars.\n\n110\n00:05:21.163 --> 00:05:24.598\nWell, CardDAV is a modified\nversion of WebDAV, but\n\n111\n00:05:24.598 --> 00:05:29.560\nit's designed to be used for\nbusiness cards or vCards, really.\n\n112\n00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.708\nThe digital business cards we have\nthat have your name, phone number,\n\n113\n00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:35.908\nemail address, mailing address,\nfax number, whatever else it is that\n\n114\n00:05:35.908 --> 00:05:39.223\nyou wanna put in there, even a picture,\nit can all be a part of that format.\n\n115\n00:05:39.223 --> 00:05:41.961\n>> So, Don, it really looks like\nWebDAV when it comes down to it,\n\n116\n00:05:41.961 --> 00:05:45.234\nforms like a basis for a lot of the\nservices you see inside of the server app.\n\n117\n00:05:45.234 --> 00:05:46.374\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n118\n00:05:46.374 --> 00:05:48.350\nIt's an open standard,\nso it's really flexible.\n\n119\n00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.675\nApple uses it for all of this stuff,\nand plenty of other vendors do too.\n\n120\n00:05:50.675 --> 00:05:52.720\nThis is not just an Apple special thing.\n\n121\n00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.115\nSo, when we get this set up, we're gonna\nuse the contact service here in OS X, but\n\n122\n00:05:57.115 --> 00:05:58.983\nyou can use third party software.\n\n123\n00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:02.450\nThere's tons of different things out\nthere, like the GTD software and\n\n124\n00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.381\neven Microsoft Outlook that can connect\nup and pull contacts through cardDAV and\n\n125\n00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:08.600\npull your calendar through CalDAV and\nso on.\n\n126\n00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.550\nSo, that's what's really\nnice about this stuff.\n\n127\n00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.672\nIt is technically using\nHTTP behind the scenes.\n\n128\n00:06:13.672 --> 00:06:16.065\nSo it's using the hypertext\ntransfer protocol, but\n\n129\n00:06:16.065 --> 00:06:18.311\non a different port number\nthan what were used to.\n\n130\n00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:20.541\nSo normally when you browse the web,\nit's on port 80.\n\n131\n00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:24.317\nBut when you're doing CardDAV, it ends up\non a crazy port, I can never remember,\n\n132\n00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:25.649\nI wrote it down, 8800.\n\n133\n00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:32.409\nSo, 8800 for the unsecured traffic and\n8843 for the secure traffic.\n\n134\n00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:36.266\nSo it's got these different port\nnumbers it uses, but it's still HTTP.\n\n135\n00:06:36.266 --> 00:06:37.360\nIt's still that standard protocol.\n\n136\n00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.592\nIt makes it really easy for\nthird parties to support it.\n\n137\n00:06:39.592 --> 00:06:44.232\nSo in the Mac world, we see it used\nin the mail app, the calendar app,\n\n138\n00:06:44.232 --> 00:06:45.513\nthe contacts app.\n\n139\n00:06:45.513 --> 00:06:49.486\nThey all use these WebDAV variations.\n\n140\n00:06:49.486 --> 00:06:52.063\nBut just in general,\nin the third party world,\n\n141\n00:06:52.063 --> 00:06:54.650\nyou see tons of software\nthat leverages it too.\n\n142\n00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.464\nSo, that got turned on in the background.\n\n143\n00:06:56.464 --> 00:07:00.740\nKind of a mini web server was turned\non and a database was created.\n\n144\n00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.250\nA database for all these contacts\nthat are going to be created.\n\n145\n00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.115\nNow if I didn't link\nto the Open Directory,\n\n146\n00:07:07.115 --> 00:07:10.915\nthen the database is just empty and\nI've got no contacts.\n\n147\n00:07:10.915 --> 00:07:12.718\nBut now as I start creating user accounts,\n\n148\n00:07:12.718 --> 00:07:14.781\nthey'll automatically\nget contacts created.\n\n149\n00:07:14.781 --> 00:07:18.457\nWell, I've actually already got a few user\naccounts, so it should have been drawn in.\n\n150\n00:07:18.457 --> 00:07:20.678\nBut otherwise, up to us to go in and\nstart creating the contacts.\n\n151\n00:07:20.678 --> 00:07:24.744\n>> Do the clients, Don, do they use\nname resolution for client discovery?\n\n152\n00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:26.718\n>> They can.\n\n153\n00:07:26.718 --> 00:07:30.306\nTypically, and we're gonna see this here\nin a minute, is that you got to manually\n\n154\n00:07:30.306 --> 00:07:33.744\nadd your contact server to your contacts\napp to be able to connect, and see it.\n\n155\n00:07:33.744 --> 00:07:36.647\nSo it's not really a discovery\nbased service, but\n\n156\n00:07:36.647 --> 00:07:40.966\nthe first time you launch the context\nserver, it can try auto-discover and\n\n157\n00:07:40.966 --> 00:07:43.349\nit will use DNS to try to auto-discover.\n\n158\n00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:47.047\nBut I'll be honest with you guys,\nit never works because CardDAV and\n\n159\n00:07:47.047 --> 00:07:50.570\nthese services really weren't designed for\nauto-discovery.\n\n160\n00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.707\nIt was really designed for\nemail and it works there sometimes.\n\n161\n00:07:53.707 --> 00:07:55.216\nBut even there,\nit doesn't always work perfectly.\n\n162\n00:07:55.216 --> 00:07:58.832\nSo don't count on the discovery\nalthough it does technically run it,\n\n163\n00:07:58.832 --> 00:08:00.743\nI wouldn't count on it in this case.\n\n164\n00:08:00.743 --> 00:08:04.623\nWhen we get to messages, message does\na great job of doing auto discovery, so\n\n165\n00:08:04.623 --> 00:08:07.620\nthat's an example of where it does work,\nhere not so much.\n\n166\n00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.260\nAlright, so that's fired up,\nthat's kind of running in the background,\n\n167\n00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.890\nwe're kind of in business there.\n\n168\n00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.195\nIf I want my clients to be\nable to connect to the server,\n\n169\n00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:18.475\nI'm gonna have to get them set up and\nto get them set up.\n\n170\n00:08:18.475 --> 00:08:22.545\nI'm going to have to punch in a server\nname and such where DNS comes in as I\n\n171\n00:08:22.545 --> 00:08:26.125\nhave to have DNS map this server or\nI just have to know the name.\n\n172\n00:08:26.125 --> 00:08:29.235\nRight now, my server, if I go and\nlook at my server settings here,\n\n173\n00:08:29.235 --> 00:08:30.965\nso let me just pull this back up,\n\n174\n00:08:30.965 --> 00:08:35.715\nmy server is called OSX dash server\nO one dot lab that IT proto TV.\n\n175\n00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:39.870\nThat's the name and it says it's\nreachable at this public IP so\n\n176\n00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.970\nin theory I should be able to go to any\ncomputer out there in the world and\n\n177\n00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.650\nconnect to OSX Server\n1 dot lab at tv right.\n\n178\n00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.970\nWe'll if you guys try it from home right\nnow you'll find that that name does not\n\n179\n00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:54.190\nresolve to this IP and that's because\nI've got it on a internal DNS server and\n\n180\n00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.490\nnot a public one.\n\n181\n00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.680\nIf I just want internal people to connect,\nI'm fine, I'm good to go.\n\n182\n00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.670\nBut if I want you guys to be\nable to connect from home,\n\n183\n00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.750\nI'm gonna have to make sure this\nis put on my public DNS servers.\n\n184\n00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.290\nAnd then you'll be able to see that and\nconnect and work from there.\n\n185\n00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.720\nSo, I may have a little bit more work\nto do on that one, but, otherwise,\n\n186\n00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.330\nthat's basically it.\n\n187\n00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.910\nAnd then, lastly, you know, I talked about\nthe push notifications under contacts.\n\n188\n00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:20.770\nWhat's going to happen is, by default your\ncontext application is going to reach out\n\n189\n00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:24.660\nfrom time to time to the server and\ncheck for changes and download them and\n\n190\n00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.710\nkind of maintain an offline database.\n\n191\n00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:29.830\nIf you turn on push notifications,\nthen anytime a change happens,\n\n192\n00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.580\nit will get pushed out to your clients.\n\n193\n00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.640\nSo they get that information faster.\n\n194\n00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.880\nOn a desktop, it doesn't really matter.\n\n195\n00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.474\nBut on a mobile phone or\nan iPad it makes a big difference,\n\n196\n00:09:38.474 --> 00:09:41.285\ncuz you can consume a lot of\nbattery doing periodic check ins,\n\n197\n00:09:41.285 --> 00:09:44.530\nif you have push notifications\nyou don't to check in every time.\n\n198\n00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.860\nYou can just wait for\nthe server to reach out to you.\n\n199\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.130\nA lot of us don't change our contacts out\nvery often, and so, you're not adding and\n\n200\n00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.870\nremoving contacts on a daily basis.\n\n201\n00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.570\nSo, if that's the case, you don't need\nto be checking in every 15 minutes when\n\n202\n00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.499\nyou're only making changes\nonce every 24 hours.\n\n203\n00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:03.180\nAll right, so once that's up and\nrunning, we're done.\n\n204\n00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.160\nWell, we're sort of done.\n\n205\n00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.490\nWe haven't actually seen it do anything,\nright.\n\n206\n00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.390\nSo I'm gonna jump over to a client and\nget this setup.\n\n207\n00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.550\nSo I'm logged in here on this client and\nremember what I said.\n\n208\n00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.570\nIt doesn't matter if you have\nan open directory or not.\n\n209\n00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.900\nThe contact service works\nindependent of the open directory.\n\n210\n00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.360\nI just happen to be logged in\nwith the network account here and\n\n211\n00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.650\nI'm gonna fire up my contacts app.\n\n212\n00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:27.790\nNow the contacts app by default is set\nto use a local contacts database and\n\n213\n00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.330\nso that's what I'm seeing right here.\n\n214\n00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:33.330\nWhen I first launch it I'm not connected\nto a server, I'm just connected to my\n\n215\n00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.290\nown local machine and those\nare the contacts that I'm looking at.\n\n216\n00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.390\nSo I can see that I've got\nApple Incorporated right,\n\n217\n00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.750\nthey create that one for us and that's it.\n\n218\n00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.800\nI don't have anybody else in here,\nthis is the default.\n\n219\n00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.610\nSo now I can start creating contacts,\nbut these are stored right here\n\n220\n00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:52.720\non my own machine so what I need to do is\nI need to get this connected to my server.\n\n221\n00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.860\nAnd there's two ways to do that.\n\n222\n00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.089\nThe easy way and the hard way.\n\n223\n00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:57.441\nSo let's start with the hard way.\n\n224\n00:10:57.441 --> 00:11:00.630\nThe hard way is I go up to contacts,\nand I go to add an account, right?\n\n225\n00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.350\nSo I can add the account right here, and\n\n226\n00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:07.130\nwhen I go to add it in, it's going to\nask where i'm getting my contacts from.\n\n227\n00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.490\niCloud, Exchange, Google, Facebook and so\n\n228\n00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.700\non, you can pick one of those if\nthat's who you're connecting to.\n\n229\n00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.290\nBut if you're setting up your own server,\n\n230\n00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.940\nyou're gonna need to\nchoose other contacts.\n\n231\n00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:21.450\nSo we'll go ahead and choose that, and\nnow we can specify a CardDAV server.\n\n232\n00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.150\nAnd that's basically what\nour OS X server app is.\n\n233\n00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.370\nThe account type,\nI'm gonna switch it to Manual.\n\n234\n00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.200\nIf you do Automatic it's gonna try and\nfind the server on its own and\n\n235\n00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.340\nit almost always fails.\n\n236\n00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.580\nSo I'm gonna do it manually cuz that'll\nlet me specify the server address.\n\n237\n00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.879\nSo I'll put in my name, so\nit's my email address and\n\n238\n00:11:37.879 --> 00:11:44.750\nthen I'll punch in my password and lastly\nthe server that I'm going to connect to.\n\n239\n00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:47.948\nSo I get that punched in.\n\n240\n00:11:47.948 --> 00:11:51.130\nAnd you know obviously you'll put\nin whatever it is that matches\n\n241\n00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.460\nwith your environment.\n\n242\n00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.830\nAll right, so I'll sign in and\nit's gonna reach out to that server and\n\n243\n00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:56.360\nit's gonna connect.\n\n244\n00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:02.340\nNow when it connects I'm now connected\nto this Centralized Contact Server.\n\n245\n00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.860\nLook how different everything is,\nit's not.\n\n246\n00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.160\nNot different at all, right?\n\n247\n00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.070\nSo what happened?\n\n248\n00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.980\nWell, once you're connected you're\nactually viewing contacts from more than\n\n249\n00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.840\none source, and so when you take a look\nat what you're kinda peering at here,\n\n250\n00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.870\nit doesn't look much different.\n\n251\n00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.910\nAnd when we go through to start creating\nthings, like creating new cards and\n\n252\n00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:24.910\nnew groups, you're gonna create them and\nthey all get blent together.\n\n253\n00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.760\nOn a positive side that's nice because\nall your contacts are in one place.\n\n254\n00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.980\nOn a negative side it can be\na little hard to tell which\n\n255\n00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.420\nservice am I looking at\nhere when I connect in.\n\n256\n00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.160\nWho am I actually connected to.\n\n257\n00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.330\nAnd so we can kind of tweak our view\na little bit to help with that.\n\n258\n00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:47.340\nIf you go up to the view menu up top\nyou've got the groups bar that I just\n\n259\n00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.030\nturned over here on the side.\n\n260\n00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.450\nThe group's view is hidden by default.\n\n261\n00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:55.880\nAnd when you turn that on, now you\ncan see exactly what you're viewing.\n\n262\n00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:00.400\nAnd notice that I've got On My Mac so\nthose are ones that I have created right\n\n263\n00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.190\nhere and that's where that\nApple Incorporated one is.\n\n264\n00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.680\nI've got the open directory\nif I'm connected to one and\n\n265\n00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:12.480\nI've got lab.itpro.tv, that's my contact\nserver and so when I choose that.\n\n266\n00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.630\nI'm now viewing the contact server itself,\nand\n\n267\n00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.050\nsince it's a brand new\ncontact server it's empty.\n\n268\n00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:20.970\nThere's not anything in there.\n\n269\n00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.870\nSo I need to come in and\nstart to create some contacts, and\n\n270\n00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:27.520\nthese are being created in\nthe central contact repository.\n\n271\n00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.670\nBut the contact repository it is\nconnected to the open directory too, so\n\n272\n00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.610\nif I start searching in it,\nit probably won't find it right away.\n\n273\n00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.860\nIt takes a little time for it to index.\n\n274\n00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.290\nBut after it's had time to index\nI'll be able to do a search and\n\n275\n00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.700\nit'll actually find the Open Directory\naccounts also, right?\n\n276\n00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:48.860\nBut as it stands, there we go, we can\npull it right under Directory Services.\n\n277\n00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.740\nYour name appeared for\nthe briefest moment there, Wes.\n\n278\n00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:52.300\nWhere did it go?\n\n279\n00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:55.570\nNow it's just playing with me.\n\n280\n00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:56.090\nThere we go.\n\n281\n00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.190\nSo I can pull it up and\n\n282\n00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.570\nI can see Wes right there pulling\nright from the directory.\n\n283\n00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:05.130\nAll right, but if I go back here to\nlab.itpro.tv, I can create a card.\n\n284\n00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.720\nAnd so\nI'm gonna create a contact over here.\n\n285\n00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.440\nAnd I'll provide some contact information.\n\n286\n00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.798\nLet's create one for\none of our other show hosts here.\n\n287\n00:14:11.798 --> 00:14:13.940\nWe'll do Ronnie Wong and\n\n288\n00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.990\nhe's with IT Pro TV and hold on let's\nput his cell phone number in here Wes.\n\n289\n00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.910\nAlright maybe not.\n\n290\n00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:25.430\nWe'll just put in some other information\non how you can get to talk to him.\n\n291\n00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:26.840\nAll right.\nSo, basically,\n\n292\n00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.580\njust populating it with whatever\ninformation it is you need to track on\n\n293\n00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.640\nthat employee.\n\n294\n00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.090\nYou know you got a ton of\nstuff you can put in here.\n\n295\n00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:35.730\nI guess I should put an email address for\nhim, or whatever, so\n\n296\n00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:40.890\nhe might have Ronnie@lab.itpro.tv or\nsomething like that.\n\n297\n00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:43.670\nSo I'm just gonna punch all this in.\n\n298\n00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:48.390\nNow Ronnie is not in my Open Directory,\nhe doesn't have an Open Directory account,\n\n299\n00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.690\nbut he now has a card\non the contact server.\n\n300\n00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.710\nAnd I can continue to create cards for\nanybody else and\n\n301\n00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:56.380\nit's all being created\nright here in the server.\n\n302\n00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.920\nNow notice when I hit done, I'm getting\nmy spinning pinwheel of doom right,\n\n303\n00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.920\nbecause this isn't like creating\na contact on my own system.\n\n304\n00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.160\nIt's gotta reach out to the server,\nit's gotta create the card and\n\n305\n00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.800\nsince this is the very first one, the\ndatabase is being structured right now.\n\n306\n00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.130\nSo the very first contact always does\ntake a little bit longer to create and\n\n307\n00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:19.200\nif I just, be patient here for a moment,\nit'll go ahead and get it created.\n\n308\n00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.920\nNow, what if it fails?\n\n309\n00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.330\nIf it fails and I get an error here,\nit doesn't create it then there might be\n\n310\n00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:28.080\nsomething wrong on the server and there's\na number of things that can cause it.\n\n311\n00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.810\nWell it finished right there,\nso it did work.\n\n312\n00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:35.070\nBut if it fails, I can jump over to\nthe server and I could take a look at\n\n313\n00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:38.572\nthe error logs on the contact database and\nsee if there's any problems there.\n\n314\n00:15:38.572 --> 00:15:41.970\nAnd so we'll take a look at that in\na minute but right now I'm connected up,\n\n315\n00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:46.620\nI can see my contacts and we can\ncontinue to add anybody that we need to.\n\n316\n00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.411\nAnd the cool part about this is they're\ncentralized so everybody else that\n\n317\n00:15:49.411 --> 00:15:51.684\nconnects to the contacts now\ngets to see these contacts too.\n\n318\n00:15:51.684 --> 00:15:54.258\nWe can create a company\ndirectory right here and\n\n319\n00:15:54.258 --> 00:15:57.099\neverybody's information is easy and\naccessible.\n\n320\n00:15:57.099 --> 00:15:58.691\nNow I've set this up the hard way.\n\n321\n00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:02.280\nThe hard way is,\nI've got to manually go in and\n\n322\n00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.236\nadd this server, and add my account.\n\n323\n00:16:05.236 --> 00:16:09.725\nAn easier way to push this out is\nwith the profile manager right?\n\n324\n00:16:09.725 --> 00:16:12.310\nAnd we saw this in the mail episode.\n\n325\n00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.970\nI think we looked at it a little\nbit in the last episode we did, but\n\n326\n00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:16.630\nlet's see it again.\n\n327\n00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:22.020\nSo if I wanna quickly configure\neverybody to use the contact server,\n\n328\n00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:26.140\nthe easiest way to do that,\nis if you've got the profile manager.\n\n329\n00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.310\nIn the profile manager, which if you\nhaven't used the profile manager before,\n\n330\n00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:32.590\ndefinitely check out our\nprofile manager episode.\n\n331\n00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:36.360\nBut the profile manager just allows us to\npush settings out to client computers, and\n\n332\n00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.220\none of its default settings,\nright here, this settings for everyone,\n\n333\n00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:45.690\nhas the option in there to include\nconfigurations for services.\n\n334\n00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:50.723\nAnd notice how it's got the calendar and\nthe contacts icon, right?\n\n335\n00:16:50.723 --> 00:16:53.259\nI turned on the contacts server, and so,\n\n336\n00:16:53.259 --> 00:16:57.250\nnow it can push out the contacts\nconnection to all of my machines.\n\n337\n00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:01.300\nI could be managing 10,000 machines and\nit's gonna push out the settings for me so\n\n338\n00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.720\nthat everybody's automatically\nset up to use it.\n\n339\n00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.660\nNow I'll probably have to wait.\n\n340\n00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.220\nMost machines only check in once a day to\nsee if there's an update to their policy.\n\n341\n00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.880\nAnd then it'll take that update and\nget kind of clear and move forward.\n\n342\n00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.780\nBut, if I’m in a hurry,\nI can always go to a client machine and\n\n343\n00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.700\nmanually apply the profile to them.\n\n344\n00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.085\nSo, for example,\nif I come back over here to this machine,\n\n345\n00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:26.420\nI’m gonna switch over to Wes,\nso I'm gonna log in as Wes.\n\n346\n00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:31.809\nAnd for Wes,\nhe is set to use the profile manager.\n\n347\n00:17:31.809 --> 00:17:35.373\nSo, his login,\nwhen he gets connected into this laptop,\n\n348\n00:17:35.373 --> 00:17:39.790\nhe's gotta set up with a profile\nmanager as managing this system.\n\n349\n00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.508\nAnd so, it's automatically\nconfiguring accounts for him.\n\n350\n00:17:42.508 --> 00:17:46.018\nWell, it probably won't have\nconfigured the contacts account.\n\n351\n00:17:46.018 --> 00:17:47.020\nLet me just check.\n\n352\n00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.947\nI'm gonna go into system preferences.\n\n353\n00:17:48.947 --> 00:17:50.538\nAnd I'll go into Internet accounts, and\n\n354\n00:17:50.538 --> 00:17:52.360\nI'll just see if the contact\naccount shows up.\n\n355\n00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.910\nIt should show up there.\n\n356\n00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:57.020\nSo, when I go under Internet accounts.\n\n357\n00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:00.250\nAnd I look,\nsee how I've got mail and calendars?\n\n358\n00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.860\nNo contacts, right?\n\n359\n00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.470\nAnd that's just because I haven't waited.\n\n360\n00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.740\nAnd if we wanted to do a 24 hour show and\nwait,\n\n361\n00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:08.433\nat some point in that 24\nhour period it would update.\n\n362\n00:18:08.433 --> 00:18:13.262\nBut if I want to force it along, all we\nreally have to do Is login to the profile\n\n363\n00:18:13.262 --> 00:18:15.940\nmanager and just reapply that profile.\n\n364\n00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.900\nSo I'm gonna browse to that server.\n\n365\n00:18:20.008 --> 00:18:24.252\nAnd I'm just using a web browser to browse\nto the server name /mydevices, right?\n\n366\n00:18:24.252 --> 00:18:27.170\nThat's the end user login for\nthe profile manager.\n\n367\n00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.537\nAnd so Wes is gonna get logged into this.\n\n368\n00:18:29.537 --> 00:18:33.457\nAnd when he gets logged in, he can see the\ndifferent profiles that are available, and\n\n369\n00:18:33.457 --> 00:18:34.770\nthe settings for everyone.\n\n370\n00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.660\nThat's the one that\ncontains the configuration.\n\n371\n00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:42.223\nSee how it's got contacts, calendar,\nright, and he'll apply that eventually.\n\n372\n00:18:42.223 --> 00:18:45.630\nBut, if I just reinstall it,\nthat'll make it apply right now.\n\n373\n00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:47.090\nSo I'm gonna reapply it.\n\n374\n00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:48.770\nSo here we go applying that.\n\n375\n00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:53.180\nAnd that file contains everything\nneeded except for his password, right?\n\n376\n00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.322\nIt's not gonna transmit his\npassword as a part of this file,\n\n377\n00:18:55.322 --> 00:18:56.419\nthat would be a security risk.\n\n378\n00:18:56.419 --> 00:18:59.185\nSo when it goes to apply,\nit's just gonna prompt for that password.\n\n379\n00:18:59.185 --> 00:19:02.314\nSo I'll punch it in, and\nnow it's gonna re-apply so\n\n380\n00:19:02.314 --> 00:19:06.778\nit's gonna get us configured for\nthe calendar and the contacts, and so on.\n\n381\n00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:11.534\nSo, Wes doesn't have to know, he doesn't\nhave to know the server address or\n\n382\n00:19:11.534 --> 00:19:15.377\nany of that stuff,\nit's just automatically configured.\n\n383\n00:19:15.377 --> 00:19:16.706\nI must have put the wrong password in.\n\n384\n00:19:16.706 --> 00:19:19.290\nSo now I can see here that\nI've got calendars and\n\n385\n00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.755\nit's twice because it was already applied.\n\n386\n00:19:21.755 --> 00:19:23.000\nI kind of rushed it.\n\n387\n00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.800\nBut then i've got contacts already set up,\nand I guess I did get the password right,\n\n388\n00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.410\nit's already got it.\n\n389\n00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.936\nIf you get the password wrong, then\ninstead of saying right contacts here,\n\n390\n00:19:32.936 --> 00:19:34.490\nit will say inactive.\n\n391\n00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:37.400\nAnd so mine says contacts,\nso it is apparently right.\n\n392\n00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.060\nSo now I can go and\nI can fire up the contacts screen.\n\n393\n00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:44.304\nAnd it should be set up\nto connect to the server.\n\n394\n00:19:44.304 --> 00:19:45.987\nNow I just see Apple incorporated, but\n\n395\n00:19:45.987 --> 00:19:49.048\nthat's probably cuz I'm viewing\nmy local account database, right?\n\n396\n00:19:49.048 --> 00:19:54.170\nSo I'm gonna take that and go up to\nmy view and turn on the group view.\n\n397\n00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.830\nAnd now I can see that server name in\nthere, and boy is that server name long.\n\n398\n00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.738\nAnd notice down here under directories,\n\n399\n00:20:00.738 --> 00:20:04.450\nhe's seeing the server down there\ntoo because the server is set\n\n400\n00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:09.450\nto do quires not just for the cards,\nbut also for the directory.\n\n401\n00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.316\nSo the server shows up in both places.\n\n402\n00:20:11.316 --> 00:20:16.405\nAll right, so if he chooses that server,\nthen, well we're getting\n\n403\n00:20:16.405 --> 00:20:21.160\nnew results right now, but\nit's still, it does have to index.\n\n404\n00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.230\nWhat it's actually doing is it's building\na local copy of that database, and\n\n405\n00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.140\nit's gotta wait to download that and\npull it.\n\n406\n00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:30.695\nSo I have to give it a minute to do that,\nbut basically it's gonna connect up and\n\n407\n00:20:30.695 --> 00:20:33.780\npull those contacts, and then we'll\nbe able to search and find them.\n\n408\n00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.200\nAnd, actually I'm searching for\nyou, and we created a contact for\n\n409\n00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:36.850\nRonnie, didn't we?\n\n410\n00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.250\nYeah, given enough time that will turn up.\n\n411\n00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.392\nSo, we just have to kind of wait.\n\n412\n00:20:41.392 --> 00:20:44.031\nBut, it's connected to the server,\nit's querying the data, and\n\n413\n00:20:44.031 --> 00:20:45.897\nthen that information will come in and\nshow up.\n\n414\n00:20:45.897 --> 00:20:50.989\n>> Don, when the user decides that they\nwanna add a new contact to their contacts,\n\n415\n00:20:50.989 --> 00:20:54.791\ndoes that get stored in that\ndatabase as well, centrally?\n\n416\n00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:58.084\nFor instance, if I wanted to create\na contact, would it get stored there?\n\n417\n00:20:58.084 --> 00:21:00.088\nOr would that be something\nan administrator has to do?\n\n418\n00:21:00.088 --> 00:21:03.341\n>> So it's up to you, once you're\nconnected you can create contacts, right?\n\n419\n00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:05.660\nSo everybody's got the little plus sign,\nand\n\n420\n00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.410\nwhat it comes down to is what you're\nhighlighting when you go to create it.\n\n421\n00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.078\nWhen you go to create a new contact,\nyou can look and\n\n422\n00:21:12.078 --> 00:21:15.181\nsee how it's got the whole add photo,\nname, and so on, and\n\n423\n00:21:15.181 --> 00:21:18.679\nnowhere in here does it mention\nwhere it's actually creating it.\n\n424\n00:21:18.679 --> 00:21:21.770\nSo it's up to you to create\nit to the right place.\n\n425\n00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:26.030\nSo on the left side here,\nif I click on all on my Mac, and\n\n426\n00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:29.340\nI go to create a contact, it's gonna\ncreate it right here on my own computer.\n\n427\n00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.544\nBut if I choose that central directory and\nI create it here,\n\n428\n00:21:32.544 --> 00:21:34.349\nnow it's gonna be on the server.\n\n429\n00:21:34.349 --> 00:21:38.270\nAnd when I go to all contacts, I'll see\nthe mixture of all those in one place.\n\n430\n00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:42.210\nAnd so when I go to add a contact here it\ngets really confusing, because it doesn't\n\n431\n00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:46.070\nnecessarily know where to create it,\nand it's gonna default to on your Mac.\n\n432\n00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.779\nAnd so you could be creating\nthem on your Mac when you think\n\n433\n00:21:48.779 --> 00:21:50.586\nyou're creating them on the server,\n\n434\n00:21:50.586 --> 00:21:54.325\nwhich in hindsight, I might have done\nthat when I created Ronnie's account.\n\n435\n00:21:54.325 --> 00:21:58.614\n>> Don, if you've created a contact and\nit's stored in that centralized location,\n\n436\n00:21:58.614 --> 00:22:02.059\ncan I edit it, or is that something\nthat's like for permissions?\n\n437\n00:22:02.059 --> 00:22:04.384\nYou're the owner of it and\nI can't modify it.\n\n438\n00:22:04.384 --> 00:22:05.884\n>> You are the owner of it, and so\n\n439\n00:22:05.884 --> 00:22:09.724\nit is kinda limited to you unless you\nhappen to be an administrator, right?\n\n440\n00:22:09.724 --> 00:22:14.395\nSo, when you create a network account on a\nserver, so like if I jump back up here and\n\n441\n00:22:14.395 --> 00:22:18.593\nI take a look at these use accounts,\nsee how my account is listed here, and\n\n442\n00:22:18.593 --> 00:22:19.920\nI'm an admin.\n\n443\n00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.641\nAnd so since I'm flagged as an admin,\nI can edit any of them.\n\n444\n00:22:22.641 --> 00:22:24.363\nBut then if we take\na look at your account,\n\n445\n00:22:24.363 --> 00:22:26.147\nWes, we can see that you're not an admin.\n\n446\n00:22:26.147 --> 00:22:28.954\nAnd so you wouldn't be able to\nedit somebody else's contacts.\n\n447\n00:22:28.954 --> 00:22:31.919\n>> Yeah, and the reason I ask that\nis I would think of conflicts,\n\n448\n00:22:31.919 --> 00:22:34.827\nif two people could edit the same\ncontent at the same time, so\n\n449\n00:22:34.827 --> 00:22:39.080\nwe don't really have to worry about\nthose conflicts here in that context.\n\n450\n00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.690\n>> Yeah, I mean you could still\ntechnically have a conflict if there were\n\n451\n00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:46.730\ntwo admins that wanted to modify the same\ncontact, then really it's just whoever\n\n452\n00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:50.330\ndoes it last that wins,\nthey overwrite the other person.\n\n453\n00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:53.973\nAnd so that kind of stuff does happen.\n\n454\n00:22:53.973 --> 00:22:58.624\nAny kind of shared service is gonna\nhave there where you get a conflict and\n\n455\n00:22:58.624 --> 00:23:01.228\nit's just a standard occurrence, so.\n\n456\n00:23:01.228 --> 00:23:02.951\nBut it is nice to have\nthe central repository,\n\n457\n00:23:02.951 --> 00:23:04.551\nyou create all your users accounts there.\n\n458\n00:23:04.551 --> 00:23:07.725\nYou've got this one place to go and\nmultiple people can update it, so\n\n459\n00:23:07.725 --> 00:23:08.446\nit stays live.\n\n460\n00:23:08.446 --> 00:23:12.345\nPeople can update their own record, so if\nI know that my data changes I can go and\n\n461\n00:23:12.345 --> 00:23:14.430\nupdate my own record and people see that.\n\n462\n00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:20.070\nSo, a lot of different flexibilities\nthere that make it easier to use.\n\n463\n00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:23.580\nLet's see, what else did I\nwant to mention on this one?\n\n464\n00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.970\nLet's see, we saw the directories,\n\n465\n00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:30.750\nwe talked about DNS, the actual database\nitself probably won't turn up on the exam,\n\n466\n00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:34.470\nbut just if you're ever curious,\nit is tucked away on the hard drive.\n\n467\n00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:40.747\nIf we browse into slash\nlibraries slash servers, And\n\n468\n00:23:40.747 --> 00:23:44.998\nlook in there you'll see where\nyou've got a series of folders, and\n\n469\n00:23:44.998 --> 00:23:49.484\nunlike the other ones, right,\nremember how some of them, like mail.\n\n470\n00:23:49.484 --> 00:23:52.750\nMail has its own directory or\nWiki has its own directory, and\n\n471\n00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.231\nweb has its own directory.\n\n472\n00:23:54.231 --> 00:23:55.822\nAs you look through here.\n\n473\n00:23:55.822 --> 00:23:59.044\nContacts doesn't,\nit's combined with calendar.\n\n474\n00:23:59.044 --> 00:23:59.763\nCalendar and\n\n475\n00:23:59.763 --> 00:24:04.075\ncontacts, they actually share the same\nservice one's CalDav ones CardDav,\n\n476\n00:24:04.075 --> 00:24:08.930\nbut they're grouped together so it's not\na separate folder like the other ones.\n\n477\n00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.970\nBut if we poke in there,\n\n478\n00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:14.840\nwhich I'll have to bump up my\nprivileges a little bit to do.\n\n479\n00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.350\nSo I'm going to get back into there.\n\n480\n00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:22.040\nSo we take a look in there,\nyou'll see the Config and the Data and\n\n481\n00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:26.390\nit is all combined together, so\nit's not separate stuff and so\n\n482\n00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:30.640\nyou've got an actual database right here\nWhere that information is being stored.\n\n483\n00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.290\nSo when you're looking up against\nthe context database you're creating a new\n\n484\n00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:37.750\ncontext that are being put right in there\nand then you got some basic XML files that\n\n485\n00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:43.410\nare just details about the configuration,\nso all that get tucked away.\n\n486\n00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:47.220\nAgain, it's doubtful that you would\never really have to mess around in here.\n\n487\n00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.440\nBut there are some things that you\ncan configure from the command line.\n\n488\n00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.240\nAnd so you actually have this\nwhole caldavd-system.plist.\n\n489\n00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.120\nYou don't have that for contacts because\nit is technically one service so you've\n\n490\n00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.540\ngot some Contact configuration that's in\nthere as well as calendar configuration.\n\n491\n00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.900\nAfter that, it's really about it for\nthe Contact Services.\n\n492\n00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.910\nIt's not amazingly crazy and complex.\n\n493\n00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:14.340\nIt is a nice thing to have even if you\ndon't plan on manually creating contacts,\n\n494\n00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.910\nif you just want to use\nthe open directory,\n\n495\n00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.340\nit's still nice to turn\non the contacts service.\n\n496\n00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.990\nBecause now we can use the contacts app\nto look up against the open directory.\n\n497\n00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:25.650\nYou can use the contacts app to look up\nagainst the open directory even without\n\n498\n00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:26.760\nthe contacts service though.\n\n499\n00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.940\nSo you can go that route, it's just up\nto you how you want to go about it.\n\n500\n00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.320\nAt the end of the day,\n\n501\n00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.700\nif you just do the open directory\nend users can't create contacts.\n\n502\n00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.160\nThey can create them locally, but they\ncan't create them in the open directory.\n\n503\n00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.980\nIf they have the contacts service though,\n\n504\n00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.110\nnow they can create contacts on the\nserver, and get that extra functionality.\n\n505\n00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.350\nSo you just have to weigh whether or\nnot you need that.\n\n506\n00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.130\nMaybe you don't need it and\nthen it doesn't matter and\n\n507\n00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.920\nyou don't bother creating\na contact service.\n\n508\n00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.620\n>> Well Don we do appreciate a lot more\ngreat information on using collaborative\n\n509\n00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.170\nservices.\n\n510\n00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:56.710\nI'm looking at the time clock and\n\n511\n00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.450\nit does look like we're coming to\nthe end of another great episode.\n\n512\n00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:04.390\nBut before we sign out, do you got any\nadditional words you'd like to say.\n\n513\n00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:07.110\n>> Not too much, I do, I guess I want\nto point out that Ronnie's contact did\n\n514\n00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:09.700\nfinally show up,\nit just took me waiting forever.\n\n515\n00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.410\nBut it did finally turn up.\n\n516\n00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:15.330\nSo this is a matter of patience, it is\nsynchronizing between you and the server.\n\n517\n00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:18.980\nContacts aren't the most highly\nprioritized service that's\n\n518\n00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:24.510\nout there because it knows that you're\nnot constantly adding new contacts.\n\n519\n00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:27.160\nIt's however often you hire and\nfire people is what it changes.\n\n520\n00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.530\nBut it did finally turn up, so I get\na little bit of indication there, so.\n\n521\n00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:33.730\nI get impatient sometimes\nwith these services, the way,\n\n522\n00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:37.390\nI guess the one thing I didn't show was,\nif we have to troubleshoot, right?\n\n523\n00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:39.650\nSo, if we have to troubleshoot,\nlet me pull this up just real quick and\n\n524\n00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:40.750\nthen we'll wrap up.\n\n525\n00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:44.600\nIf I go back to my server app and I go to\nLogs, When we go and look at the logs.\n\n526\n00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.500\nIf I was having a problem like if\nRonnie contact never did show up.\n\n527\n00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:53.430\nI could come in here into my logs and\ncounter and contacts are combined and\n\n528\n00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.560\nso you've got an access log that\nshows people accessing the system.\n\n529\n00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.050\nThat's not necessarily good or bad.\n\n530\n00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:59.280\nIt's just people accessing.\n\n531\n00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.900\nAnd then you got the Error Log.\n\n532\n00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.690\nAnd so you can jump into the Error Log and\n\n533\n00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:05.250\nyou look to see if any\nproblems have occurred.\n\n534\n00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.870\nAnd I can see I've actually\ngot a handful of errors here,\n\n535\n00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:12.170\nlike IllegalServerResponse,\nsome kind of message that happened there.\n\n536\n00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.780\nBut if I look at the timestamps\non these this is actually, well,\n\n537\n00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.500\nactually that's all within\nthe last minute, so\n\n538\n00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.730\nI've got some kinda error\ngoing on in the background.\n\n539\n00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:23.290\nIMAP login failed for\nmeeting invitations at lab ITVPRO.\n\n540\n00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:25.970\nOkay that's from the mail\nepisode that we put up.\n\n541\n00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:27.610\nI must have put the wrong password in or\nsomething,\n\n542\n00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:29.910\nso it's trying to login to check for\ninvitations.\n\n543\n00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:30.800\nBut you can come in and look for\n\n544\n00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.730\nthat stuff and that's nice because\nwell you can troubleshoot.\n\n545\n00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:37.960\nIt's not so nice, in that the contacts and\ncalendar are combined.\n\n546\n00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.430\nRight the meeting invitation service\nthat was part of the calendar and\n\n547\n00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:42.330\nthis group right here.\n\n548\n00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:45.990\nSo I don't necessarily know if these\nare errors in the contact system or\n\n549\n00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:49.330\nthe calendar system,\nunless I look right here.\n\n550\n00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:54.470\nSee how this one says caldav-1,\nthat tells me these are calendar errors.\n\n551\n00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:59.400\nIf I scroll back I don't see any\ncardDAV errors, so it looks like I'm\n\n552\n00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.650\nin the clear as far as my card server,\neverything is working there.\n\n553\n00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:06.020\nMy calendar server might need a little\nattention though, its got some problems.\n\n554\n00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.060\n>> All right, Don, thanks again for\nall that information and we do thank you,\n\n555\n00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.340\nthe viewer, out there for watching.\n\n556\n00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.340\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign out here, IT Pro TV.\n\n557\n00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.840\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n558\n00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.970\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n559\n00:28:14.970

00:00:16.500\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.020\nAnd in today's episode, we're continuing\nthrough our OS X Server Essentials.\n\n5\n00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.850\nWe're looking at using\ncollaborative services today,\n\n6\n00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.740\nspecifically, we're looking at messages.\n\n7\n00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.350\nJoining me back in the studio again\nis none other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.540\nDon, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.865\n>> Doing swell, Wes, ready to jump\nright back into our collaboration.\n\n10\n00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:32.993\nAnd in this episode,\n\n11\n00:00:32.993 --> 00:00:36.700\nwe're taking a look at the Messages\nservice inside of the Server app.\n\n12\n00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.889\nNow, every Mac that's been sold in\nthe last, I don't know, eight or\n\n13\n00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:42.948\nnine years has had the iMessages or\n\n14\n00:00:42.948 --> 00:00:47.070\nnow just plain old Messages app as\npart of the default install of OS X.\n\n15\n00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.340\nSo you've had a way to do basically\ninstant messaging, text-based chat\n\n16\n00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.680\nbetween you and other people in your\nnetwork or even around the world.\n\n17\n00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.000\nAnd that service is still there,\nhere in El Capitan.\n\n18\n00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.840\nAnd it's a very useful one,\n\n19\n00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.800\nespecially for internal\ncommunications inside of a company.\n\n20\n00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.900\nIt's like text messaging on a cellphone,\nexcept done through your computer.\n\n21\n00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.550\nSo, we don't need cellular plans,\n\n22\n00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.605\nwe don't have to worry about\nwireless signal and all that stuff.\n\n23\n00:01:08.605 --> 00:01:11.315\nNow you can just get\nthe message right across.\n\n24\n00:01:11.315 --> 00:01:13.625\nPeople get it, they're able to\nquickly easily communicate.\n\n25\n00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:16.335\nThey can send, not just text,\nbut even pictures and\n\n26\n00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:20.080\nfiles can be transmitted this way via the\nMessages service, pretty powerful stuff.\n\n27\n00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.145\nAnd it's even been extended to do video.\n\n28\n00:01:23.145 --> 00:01:26.730\nSo you can have a video message\nbetween you and someone else, and\n\n29\n00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.360\nit's pretty powerful stuff.\n\n30\n00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.800\nNow, Apple didn't create\nthis from scratch.\n\n31\n00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.675\nIt's not like FaceTime.\n\n32\n00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:35.180\nFaceTime, Apple did create from scratch,\nbut this, the Messages service as\n\n33\n00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.495\na part of the Server app,\nis actually based on open standards.\n\n34\n00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:40.370\nIt's designed for open communications.\n\n35\n00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.240\nFaceTime, well,\nthat just works with Apple devices, but\n\n36\n00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.070\nthe Messages service in the Server app is\nbuilt on top of a protocol called XMPP.\n\n37\n00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.248\nAnd that's the, I have to cheat on\nthis one, the Extensible Messaging and\n\n38\n00:01:52.248 --> 00:01:53.453\nPresence Protocol.\n\n39\n00:01:53.453 --> 00:01:55.270\nSo what does that mean?\n\n40\n00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.749\nExtensible, it supports add-ons.\n\n41\n00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.460\nIt can do a lot more than just text.\n\n42\n00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.420\nYou can extend that functionality.\n\n43\n00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.830\nMessaging, when we send messages,\nyou send text blurbs,\n\n44\n00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.180\ntypically is what you send along.\n\n45\n00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.220\nPresence, presence means it'll tell me\nif you're active on your computer or\n\n46\n00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.390\nif you've been idling for\n15 minutes, right?\n\n47\n00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.820\nAre you away or are you there?\n\n48\n00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.320\nDo you get a green light or red light?\n\n49\n00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.270\nSo we get presence information.\n\n50\n00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.940\nAnd then protocol, it's a language that\ntwo computers can speak to each other.\n\n51\n00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.660\nNow, XMPP doesn't really\nroll off the tongue, and so\n\n52\n00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.030\nit has another name that a lot of\npeople call it, and that's Jabber.\n\n53\n00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.720\nJabber is J-A-B-B-E-R, Jabber.\n\n54\n00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.760\nAnd the Jabber protocol is XMPP, and\nXMPP is Jabber, they're the same thing.\n\n55\n00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.940\nSo, when you go out on the Internet,\nyou're gonna learn about this protocol,\n\n56\n00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.080\nyou'll see people call it\nthe two different names, but\n\n57\n00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.670\nit is actually the same.\n\n58\n00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.610\nNow, with Jabber,\nit's nice because it's an open standard.\n\n59\n00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.060\nAnybody can support it.\n\n60\n00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.850\nAnd for a while, a lot of people did.\n\n61\n00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.970\nSo, for example, Google Talk.\n\n62\n00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.370\nGoogle was using XMPP, and you could tap\ninto that and move your information and\n\n63\n00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.870\nexchange the data really easily.\n\n64\n00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.400\nAnd then about a year and\na half ago, Google said, no,\n\n65\n00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.520\nwe're gonna pull the plug on that,\nand they did.\n\n66\n00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.140\nAnd now, it's closed off to\ntheir own little world and\n\n67\n00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.580\nyou can't communicate with them.\n\n68\n00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.490\nAnd several other vendors have\ndone the exact same thing.\n\n69\n00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.430\nSo it used to be that you could\nfire up the Messages app and\n\n70\n00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.770\nyou could connect to AOL Instant Messenger\npeople, the Microsoft.\n\n71\n00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.390\nWhat's Microsoft's called, not Live\nMessenger, it's got a different name now.\n\n72\n00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.700\nBut, anyway, when Microsoft rolled\ntheirs into Skype, that broke that.\n\n73\n00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.960\nGoogle Talk, Facebook Messenger,\nall of those used to be open.\n\n74\n00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.190\nAnd now, they're starting to close off.\n\n75\n00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.780\nBut it doesn't mean\nthe Messages app is dead\n\n76\n00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.870\ncuz it's still a great way to talk\nbetween Macs on your own network.\n\n77\n00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.800\nAnd you can even do it without a server.\n\n78\n00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.060\nHaving a server is nice, but\n\n79\n00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.370\nyou don't have to have one because\nthe Messages app can actually use Bonjour,\n\n80\n00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.550\nfind the other Macs on the network and\nyou can chat with no server involved.\n\n81\n00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.472\nSo if I don't need a server,\nwhy bother having one?\n\n82\n00:03:56.472 --> 00:03:58.050\nWell, that's a very valid question, and\n\n83\n00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.040\nthere's two main reasons you're\ngonna wanna have that server.\n\n84\n00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.320\nThe first one is what if I\nhave more than one computer?\n\n85\n00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.450\nWhat if I have a laptop and\na desktop and I start chatting on one?\n\n86\n00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.280\nWell, with Bonjour,\neach machine is treated separately so\n\n87\n00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.660\nthe chat that I start on one computer\nis not present on the other one, right?\n\n88\n00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.240\nSo I've gotta make sure to\n\n89\n00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.350\nfinish off a conversation before\nmoving to another machine.\n\n90\n00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.130\nThat's always a bit of a challenge.\n\n91\n00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.360\nThe other thing is, as a company, we\nmight be required to archive those chats.\n\n92\n00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.970\nSo, for example,\nif you work for the government,\n\n93\n00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.877\nyou might have record retention policies\nthat say you've gotta record the chats.\n\n94\n00:04:33.877 --> 00:04:37.190\nWell, if everybody's chatting just\ndirectly between their own machines,\n\n95\n00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.286\nit’s really hard for\nus to record that, isn't it?\n\n96\n00:04:39.286 --> 00:04:43.220\nBut if I have a centralized server,\nall the chats pass through the server, and\n\n97\n00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.052\nwe can create a chat archive\nright there on the server.\n\n98\n00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:47.540\nAnd that’s really the main reason for\n\n99\n00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.318\nhaving a chat server is to be\nable to generate that archive.\n\n100\n00:04:50.318 --> 00:04:53.010\nNow, if somebody’s computer gets lost or\nstolen,\n\n101\n00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.437\nwe still have a record of those chats and\nthey can be recovered.\n\n102\n00:04:55.437 --> 00:04:58.760\nAnd end users never really\ngonna ask you for that.\n\n103\n00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.322\nIt's usually legal.\n\n104\n00:05:00.322 --> 00:05:01.440\n[LAUGH] It's gonna come around and\n\n105\n00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.800\nsay, we need a record of all of\nthis person's communications.\n\n106\n00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.340\nWell, you can pull up the phone log and\nyou can pull up their email, and\n\n107\n00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.670\nnow you can pull up their chat archive.\n\n108\n00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.059\nSo you'd have all of that in one place.\n\n109\n00:05:12.138 --> 00:05:13.780\nAll right, now,\n\n110\n00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.020\nas far as getting the chat servers up and\nrunning, it's actually pretty easy.\n\n111\n00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.930\nBut I will say, and\nthis is just a quick word of caution,\n\n112\n00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.460\nthis won't be on the exam I'm sure, but it\nis the most sensitive of all the services.\n\n113\n00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.430\nIt's extremely easy to break\nthe Messages service on OS X.\n\n114\n00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.970\nAnd this is in El Capitan,\nthe latest and greatest version.\n\n115\n00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.700\nIt's been like this for\nthe last four versions.\n\n116\n00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.180\nIt has always been super sensitive.\n\n117\n00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.780\nSo, if you're just gonna turn it on and\nrun it, it runs great.\n\n118\n00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.789\nBut if you start tweaking settings,\nit breaks real fast.\n\n119\n00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:51.445\nAnd even during upgrades,\nit has a tendency to break real fast.\n\n120\n00:05:51.445 --> 00:05:55.194\nAnd so I've got a series of steps that I\ngo through to reset the chat server and\n\n121\n00:05:55.194 --> 00:05:58.708\nrebuild it, and so I wanna show you\nguys those two, not in the exam, but\n\n122\n00:05:58.708 --> 00:05:59.425\nin real life.\n\n123\n00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:02.113\nIt's something that you're [LAUGH]\nbound to see sooner or later.\n\n124\n00:06:02.113 --> 00:06:05.007\nBut as far as just getting it up and\ngoing, it's pretty straightforward.\n\n125\n00:06:05.007 --> 00:06:05.770\nLet me show you.\n\n126\n00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.828\nSo I'm gonna go into my Server app.\n\n127\n00:06:07.828 --> 00:06:10.210\nAnd down to the left side,\nas we just look down the line,\n\n128\n00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.280\nwe'll find Messages right there.\n\n129\n00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.170\nAnd so I can choose Messages.\n\n130\n00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.470\nAnd then over here,\nwe have just a handful of settings, okay?\n\n131\n00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.610\nWe've got Permissions, who is\nallowed to use the messaging server.\n\n132\n00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.039\nSo you might not want everybody to use it.\n\n133\n00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:25.524\nYou can pick and choose just like\nall the services we've seen.\n\n134\n00:06:25.524 --> 00:06:28.590\nThen we've got the Federation, okay?\n\n135\n00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.280\nWhat's a federation?\n\n136\n00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.230\nWell, when you create a chat server,\nit thinks it's all by itself.\n\n137\n00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.130\nIt thinks it's the only chat\nserver that's out there.\n\n138\n00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.210\nBut when you create a federation,\n\n139\n00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.160\nyour chat server gets linked\nto other chat servers.\n\n140\n00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.350\nAnd now Messages can get relayed\nbetween the different servers.\n\n141\n00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.576\nThis might be a chat server at\na remote location for your company.\n\n142\n00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:52.485\nThis might be a chat server that belongs\nto a completely separate company,\n\n143\n00:06:52.485 --> 00:06:54.780\nthat's like a business\npartner you deal with.\n\n144\n00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.840\nThis might be a public service\nlike Facebook that you\n\n145\n00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.500\nfederate with to be able to exchange\nchat messages back and forth with them.\n\n146\n00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.540\nIt's whatever you want it to be really,\nbut\n\n147\n00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.040\nit's connecting your chat server to\nother chat environments out there.\n\n148\n00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.427\nIf you edit the Federation settings,\nyou'll see here where you can come in and\n\n149\n00:07:11.427 --> 00:07:14.330\nyou can create that\nserver-to-server federation.\n\n150\n00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.800\nAnd you can add in domains\nthat are allowed to federate.\n\n151\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.610\nNow notice how it doesn't actually let\nme specify who to connect to, right?\n\n152\n00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.380\nBy default, this is allow\nfederation with any domain, and\n\n153\n00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.480\nthat's it, or\nI can restrict it to domains.\n\n154\n00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.330\nBut if I wanna connect to a third party\nvendor, how do I put their server in here?\n\n155\n00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.960\nThey don't have a way, all right?\n\n156\n00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.410\nApple supports being the target for\nthe federation, not the source.\n\n157\n00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.080\nIn other words, I would need\nto go to the other company and\n\n158\n00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.650\npoint them to my server\nto have them connect.\n\n159\n00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.810\nAnd as long as this was turned on,\nI would allow that federation and\n\n160\n00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.750\nwe'd start exchanging messages.\n\n161\n00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:56.284\nBut they haven't given me the graphical\nuser interface elements to be able to\n\n162\n00:07:56.284 --> 00:07:59.787\nbe the source,\nto point to somebody else that's not here.\n\n163\n00:07:59.787 --> 00:08:03.925\nWe can do it from the command line, but\nremember what I said just a moment ago,\n\n164\n00:08:03.925 --> 00:08:05.071\nthe chat service is so\n\n165\n00:08:05.071 --> 00:08:08.461\neasy to break that you really\nwanna avoid doing that if you can.\n\n166\n00:08:08.461 --> 00:08:12.592\nBut you do have that ability to come in\nand create a federation of servers and\n\n167\n00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:15.817\nget those linked together to\nexchange that information.\n\n168\n00:08:15.817 --> 00:08:18.590\nI'm going to turn that off because\nI don't have any other servers.\n\n169\n00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.970\nThis is going to be my only chat server.\n\n170\n00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.470\nThe last option is to\nArchive all messages.\n\n171\n00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.054\nIt is off by default.\n\n172\n00:08:25.054 --> 00:08:28.501\nSo by default, somebody chats, and the\nchats disappear, and that's the end of it.\n\n173\n00:08:28.501 --> 00:08:31.690\nThere's no way to recover those\nchat messages once they're gone.\n\n174\n00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:36.106\nIf I turn on the archive, now every\ntime somebody chats through the server,\n\n175\n00:08:36.106 --> 00:08:37.558\nwe're gonna record it.\n\n176\n00:08:37.558 --> 00:08:40.415\nAnd it's gonna store it on the hard\ndrive in an archive folder, and\n\n177\n00:08:40.415 --> 00:08:42.980\nthey give us a nice little button\nto find that in the Finder.\n\n178\n00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.357\nNow the folder probably doesn't exist yet\ncuz I haven't started the service.\n\n179\n00:08:46.357 --> 00:08:47.810\nSo I'm gonna turn the service on.\n\n180\n00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:48.350\nThere we go.\n\n181\n00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.960\nSo it's up and it's on, and\nnow I'll hit that Show in Finder.\n\n182\n00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.832\nAnd it's gonna bring\nup a Finder window and\n\n183\n00:08:53.832 --> 00:08:56.010\ntake me to the Message Archives folder.\n\n184\n00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.381\nNow we can't see it, but\nit's in /Library/Server.\n\n185\n00:08:59.381 --> 00:09:03.321\nActually here,\nlet me turn on my little path.\n\n186\n00:09:03.321 --> 00:09:05.122\nWhere's the path preview?\n\n187\n00:09:05.122 --> 00:09:06.427\nThere we go.\n\n188\n00:09:06.427 --> 00:09:11.340\n/Library/Server/Messages/Data/message_arc-\nhives, and so\n\n189\n00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:16.759\nnow as people chat, they'll get lumped\nright here into the archive folder.\n\n190\n00:09:16.759 --> 00:09:20.224\nAnd I don't have any chats yet, but we're\ngoing to do some chats here in a moment\n\n191\n00:09:20.224 --> 00:09:23.620\nand we'll see those appear and actually\nget a chance to see the files pop up.\n\n192\n00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:28.180\nSo it's going to create these files that\nlog all of the chat messages for each day,\n\n193\n00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.240\nand that's going to grow over time so\n\n194\n00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.170\nwe need to make sure we\nbackup this folder, and\n\n195\n00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.480\neventually we'll need to purge some of the\ndata out of the folder if it gets too big.\n\n196\n00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.330\nWe don't wanna fill up our hard drive.\n\n197\n00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:42.298\nChat messages don't normally take up\na whole lot of space, so you can go years,\n\n198\n00:09:42.298 --> 00:09:46.319\neven, without purging this,\nbut eventually you'll need to.\n\n199\n00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:48.290\nSo at this point I've got\na messenger server up and running.\n\n200\n00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.680\nIt really was pretty easy.\n\n201\n00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.634\nThe only thing I did was turn on\narchiving, and I flipped the on switch.\n\n202\n00:09:54.634 --> 00:09:57.420\nWe're done, on the server side.\n\n203\n00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.360\nNow we need to get our clients connected,\nand just like with the other services,\n\n204\n00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.300\nthere's a hard way and an easy way.\n\n205\n00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.020\nThe hard way is we\nmanually add the server.\n\n206\n00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.150\nThat certainly works.\n\n207\n00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.770\nThe easy way is we use the Profile Manger\nto push out the settings,\n\n208\n00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.520\nwhich it does automatically.\n\n209\n00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.710\nIf I go to my Profile Manager and\nI look at these Settings for Everyone.\n\n210\n00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:19.180\nInside of Settings for Everyone,\nI can see that it's pushing mail,\n\n211\n00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.540\ncalendar, contacts, and messages.\n\n212\n00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.290\nSo it's gonna push the configuration for\nmessages out.\n\n213\n00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.030\nSo when people launch\ntheir messages client,\n\n214\n00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.060\nit's already set up to connect\nto our server and chat.\n\n215\n00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.730\nSo we're already taken care of.\n\n216\n00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.781\nSo that makes life a lot\neasier if we go this route.\n\n217\n00:10:34.781 --> 00:10:37.708\nSo the Profile Manager, that's the easy\nway, but let's do this the hard way.\n\n218\n00:10:37.708 --> 00:10:39.570\nWe're gonna jump over to the client and\nmanually set it up.\n\n219\n00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.450\nSo I've got my trusty El Capitan\nworkstation here, and\n\n220\n00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.790\nI'm gonna fire up my Messages app.\n\n221\n00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:49.870\nIt's in the dock by default, but\nyou can launch it from Applications.\n\n222\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.182\nAnd it's gonna to try and\nconnect us out to iCloud.\n\n223\n00:10:53.182 --> 00:10:55.137\nApple wants you to use iCloud for\na lot of this stuff.\n\n224\n00:10:55.137 --> 00:10:57.349\nThey can manage the chat server for\nyou and off you go.\n\n225\n00:10:57.349 --> 00:11:01.223\nBut in our case we want to run our own\nserver, so we're going to say, Not Now,\n\n226\n00:11:01.223 --> 00:11:03.340\nand Yes, we really mean it.\n\n227\n00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.780\nAnd now it's gonna take\nus into the Messages app,\n\n228\n00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.470\nand it's not very functional by default.\n\n229\n00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:13.310\nSo it's asking us to connect to Google,\nYahoo, Aol, or an other messages account.\n\n230\n00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.220\nNow the Google one,\nI don't think that one works anymore,\n\n231\n00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.950\nunless something's changed\nthat I don't know of.\n\n232\n00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.583\nBut the other two you could connect to.\n\n233\n00:11:18.583 --> 00:11:21.280\nI'm gonna choose Other messages account.\n\n234\n00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.010\nAnd now it's gonna ask what type\nof server I wanna connect to, and\n\n235\n00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.560\nI've got an Aol instant message server.\n\n236\n00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.210\nThat's not necessarily Aol.\n\n237\n00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:32.740\nYou can run your own private AIM server,\nif you want, but we've got Jabber.\n\n238\n00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.490\nXMPP is Jabber,\nthat's what I'm gonna choose, and\n\n239\n00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.160\nnow we can get connected to our server.\n\n240\n00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.998\nSo I'm gonna punch in my user name.\n\n241\n00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:42.208\nNow your user name is basically whatever\nyou're logging into the server with.\n\n242\n00:11:42.208 --> 00:11:47.149\nSo I'm gonna connect, and I'm gonna\nuse the local name of that server,\n\n243\n00:11:47.149 --> 00:11:52.090\nand I'll punch in my password, and\nthen the server that we're actually\n\n244\n00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:57.288\ngoing to connect to, so I'll punch that\nin right here and get that defined.\n\n245\n00:11:57.288 --> 00:11:59.140\nSo these are the servers\nwe're gonna connect to.\n\n246\n00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.140\nThe port, I can leave that automatic.\n\n247\n00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.570\nRemember what I said,\nthat by default it uses port 5222?\n\n248\n00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.600\nThat's for unencrypted connections.\n\n249\n00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.650\n5223 is for encrypted.\n\n250\n00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.860\nIt can figure that out for us,\nand I've got a set to use SSL, so\n\n251\n00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.090\nit's going to try and use that.\n\n252\n00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.631\nNow I never did set up\ncertificates on my server, so\n\n253\n00:12:15.631 --> 00:12:17.768\nthat means I've gotta self-signed one.\n\n254\n00:12:17.768 --> 00:12:19.622\nAnd so I'm probably going to\nget a certificate warning,\n\n255\n00:12:19.622 --> 00:12:21.680\nlike that it can't validate the identity,\nbut that's okay.\n\n256\n00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.028\nI'll clear it.\n\n257\n00:12:23.028 --> 00:12:25.313\nIf you want to go unencrypted,\nyou certainly can, but\n\n258\n00:12:25.313 --> 00:12:27.560\nthat may not be the best choice\nyou make in a given day.\n\n259\n00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.940\nSo I'm going to leave that set.\n\n260\n00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.108\nNow we do have Kerberos\nauthentication as an option.\n\n261\n00:12:31.108 --> 00:12:33.027\nThat's not for when we connect to a Mac.\n\n262\n00:12:33.027 --> 00:12:36.272\nThat's for when we connect to\na third party XMPP server.\n\n263\n00:12:36.272 --> 00:12:38.313\nThey might have that set to require it.\n\n264\n00:12:38.313 --> 00:12:39.323\nMicrosoft does it.\n\n265\n00:12:39.323 --> 00:12:40.970\nA lot of Unix systems do it.\n\n266\n00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:44.380\nOn the Apple side, though, we use\nour regular Apple authentication, so\n\n267\n00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.270\nwe don't have to worry about that.\n\n268\n00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.050\nAnd I go and hit sign in.\n\n269\n00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:49.750\nI can try and hit Sign In.\n\n270\n00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.720\nThere we go.\nAnd it's gonna reach out to the server.\n\n271\n00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.360\nSo it's gonna say Connecting, and\nthen one of two things is gonna happen.\n\n272\n00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.240\nEither one, it's gonna go offline,\nor two, it's gonna connect.\n\n273\n00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.250\nWell mine went offline, so\nthat meant I have a problem, and\n\n274\n00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.810\nmy problem is we can't\nverify the identity.\n\n275\n00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.660\nI don't trust the certificate that\ncame from the server cuz we're using\n\n276\n00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.990\na self-signed one.\n\n277\n00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.390\nI'm okay with that, so I'll hit Continue.\n\n278\n00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.400\nAnd now it connects, and I'm available.\n\n279\n00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.030\nI see my buddy list,\nall my friends that are out there.\n\n280\n00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.160\nAnd I can see right down here that\nmy status is currently available.\n\n281\n00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.440\nNow my buddy list is kinda empty\nbecause I don't have any buddies.\n\n282\n00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.325\nI have no friends, and I'm also the only\nperson set up for using messages\n\n283\n00:13:27.325 --> 00:13:30.863\nright now, so I can't connect anybody\nelse unless they get connected too.\n\n284\n00:13:30.863 --> 00:13:36.845\nSo I'm gonna jump over to Wes' account and\nget him set up to use messages also.\n\n285\n00:13:36.845 --> 00:13:41.515\nSo, again, I could use the Profile Manager\nto push the settings out to him, or\n\n286\n00:13:41.515 --> 00:13:44.845\nI could just jump in here and\nget it set up myself,\n\n287\n00:13:44.845 --> 00:13:49.170\nwhich is what I'm gonna do, after we\nclose all this other junk that he has.\n\n288\n00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:51.330\nAnd so we'll get into Messages and\n\n289\n00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.200\nwe'll get him logged in the same\nway I just did a moment ago.\n\n290\n00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.140\nYou see where this would be a problem\nif we had a thousand machines.\n\n291\n00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.030\nI don't want everybody to have to go and\nlog in and\n\n292\n00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.670\nknow the server name and all that.\n\n293\n00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.520\nProfile Manager makes that a lot easier.\n\n294\n00:14:03.675 --> 00:14:08.226\nSo just getting him logged in,\npunching in my server.\n\n295\n00:14:08.226 --> 00:14:12.660\nAnd I do want to mention again that\nwe don't have to have a server.\n\n296\n00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.465\nWe could just use Bonjour on the local\nnetwork without a server and\n\n297\n00:14:15.465 --> 00:14:17.000\nthat would work just fine.\n\n298\n00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.430\nBut because I wanna make sure that I get\nan archive of all the chats that occur,\n\n299\n00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.070\nI really wanna have that server.\n\n300\n00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.620\nSo that's why I'm wanting to provide this.\n\n301\n00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.770\nAlmost typed the port number,\nwhich I could type the port number,\n\n302\n00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.930\nit wouldn't matter, but\nit'll find it on its own, too.\n\n303\n00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.060\nSo we'll get connected there.\n\n304\n00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:33.820\nSo he's gonna connect.\n\n305\n00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.340\nHe'll probably get the same\ncertificate warning.\n\n306\n00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.274\nActually you might not because,\nno, there you did.\n\n307\n00:14:39.274 --> 00:14:42.111\nI was going to say, you might not because\nyou had the Profile Manager set up for\n\n308\n00:14:42.111 --> 00:14:45.160\nyour account, so you may trust\nthat certificate, but there we go.\n\n309\n00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.750\nSo now I'm up and going,\nand he sees Don Pezet,\n\n310\n00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.400\nnot necessarily as one\nof his super buddies.\n\n311\n00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.570\nSo I'm gonna just kind of leave, well\nactually, you're there, just my regular\n\n312\n00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:58.170\ncommunication, but it is showing me\nas offline which is a little odd.\n\n313\n00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:04.170\nIf I float over DonPezet, I show as being\nthere, but I'm under the offline category.\n\n314\n00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.400\nHow am I offline?\n\n315\n00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.270\nI was just logged in a second ago.\n\n316\n00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:10.360\nWell what happens is the client\nis actually really smart.\n\n317\n00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.140\nIt's showing as available.\n\n318\n00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.600\nIf Wes were to walk away and\nnot touch this computer for\n\n319\n00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.100\nfive minutes,\nit'll change that to show you as away.\n\n320\n00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.500\nBut I locked my screen.\n\n321\n00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.750\nWhen I used fast user switching to jump\nover to Wes' account I locked my screen,\n\n322\n00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.260\nand so, when that happens,\nit flags you as offline.\n\n323\n00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.428\nIt's paying attention to\nthe state your computer is in.\n\n324\n00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:32.555\nIf you're computer goes to sleep,\nif you're computer powers down,\n\n325\n00:15:32.555 --> 00:15:35.417\nit changes you to offline first to\nmake sure that people know that\n\n326\n00:15:35.417 --> 00:15:37.340\nyou're not available right now.\n\n327\n00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.130\n>> And Don, is this all part of Jabber or\n\n328\n00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.720\nthe XMPP, that presence you said\nin the lovely acronym there?\n\n329\n00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.490\n>> Yep, absolutely.\n\n330\n00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:47.480\nIt's a part of it, and it's one of the\nmore valuable parts too, cuz I might look,\n\n331\n00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.920\nand if I see that you're not available,\nthat means you're not at your desk.\n\n332\n00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.220\nIf you're not at your desk,\n\n333\n00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.540\nmaybe you've already left that meeting\nwe have scheduled or something.\n\n334\n00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.610\nYou kinda get an idea what that\nperson's current activities are.\n\n335\n00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.040\nBut if they're at their desk, and\nyou called and they don't answer,\n\n336\n00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.050\nwell maybe they're busy.\n\n337\n00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:02.170\nMaybe they're working on something.\n\n338\n00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.244\nSo you get a little\ninformation about that person.\n\n339\n00:16:04.244 --> 00:16:05.379\nIt's a neat thing to have.\n\n340\n00:16:05.379 --> 00:16:07.206\nAnd you can manually change your status.\n\n341\n00:16:07.206 --> 00:16:10.115\nIf I go down here to that little menu,\nI can click on it.\n\n342\n00:16:10.115 --> 00:16:11.250\nAnd I can go Offline.\n\n343\n00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:14.605\nI can go Invisible, where I'm online but\npeople think I'm offline.\n\n344\n00:16:14.605 --> 00:16:18.410\nYou can have it show\nyour Current iTunes Song.\n\n345\n00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.830\nThere's a valuable use of time.\n\n346\n00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.400\nBut you can also set it as Away,\nor Custom Away.\n\n347\n00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:28.770\nYou can change it to Custom Away,\nand you can say, Left for meeting.\n\n348\n00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:33.030\nAnd now people know you're away, but\nthey know that you'll be back soon.\n\n349\n00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:37.260\nOr you could even change it\nto change it to say like,\n\n350\n00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:41.120\nBack at 3 pm, and that way they have\nan idea of when you'll be back online,\n\n351\n00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.410\nand that's kind of a neat thing to have.\n\n352\n00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:44.378\n>> Well Don,\nI'd like you to set mine, please,\n\n353\n00:16:44.378 --> 00:16:46.402\nto ignoring Don playing video games,\nplease.\n\n354\n00:16:46.402 --> 00:16:47.543\n>> [LAUGH] There you go.\n\n355\n00:16:47.543 --> 00:16:52.076\nFor Wes, if he jumps into his chat,\nhere, and\n\n356\n00:16:52.076 --> 00:16:57.326\nreaches out to communicate with me or\nsomebody else.\n\n357\n00:16:57.326 --> 00:16:59.331\nLet's see, is it, shoot.\n\n358\n00:16:59.331 --> 00:17:02.290\nI don't have any existing conversations so\nit's not gonna let me do that.\n\n359\n00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:07.090\nBut if he goes to throw a chat message\nto me and I'm offline, does it not work?\n\n360\n00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:07.854\nNo, it goes.\n\n361\n00:17:07.854 --> 00:17:12.094\nIt just gets stored on the server and I'll\nsee it the next time that I log in and\n\n362\n00:17:12.094 --> 00:17:13.031\nget connected.\n\n363\n00:17:13.031 --> 00:17:16.264\nLet me get him back to online and\navailable.\n\n364\n00:17:16.264 --> 00:17:17.950\nThere we go.\n\n365\n00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:22.550\nAnd so now if he starts to chat or\nwhatever, so he's gonna send me a chat.\n\n366\n00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.710\nAnd you can just use the To field up here,\nkinda like an e-mail.\n\n367\n00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.980\nI didn't mean to maximize that,\noops, now I'm gonna make it worse.\n\n368\n00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:34.610\nAnyhow, so he can send me chat,\nand here is a chat.\n\n369\n00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:35.876\nSo he's sending me a message.\n\n370\n00:17:35.876 --> 00:17:39.752\nNow I'm offline, so\nI'm not gonna get that message right away,\n\n371\n00:17:39.752 --> 00:17:42.100\nuntil I'm online again.\n\n372\n00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:47.049\nBut if I jump back over to my account,\nand let me just log back in.\n\n373\n00:17:47.049 --> 00:17:49.040\nSo I've got iMessage up and running.\n\n374\n00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.150\nSee how it's trying to\nconnect to the server again?\n\n375\n00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:54.260\nAnd there's the chat from Wes,\nright there.\n\n376\n00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.524\nSo I got it and now we can start to\ncommunicate, and everything's fine.\n\n377\n00:17:57.524 --> 00:18:00.050\nKind of a neat little way to be\nable to communicate quickly.\n\n378\n00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:04.050\nYou can also drag and drop files onto\nthis and it'll send a file across.\n\n379\n00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:07.670\nIf you've got a video camera,\nyou can hit the little camera icon and\n\n380\n00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.200\ninitiate a video call.\n\n381\n00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.190\nSo here it's gonna try and reach out to\nmy camera, which Is slowly turning on.\n\n382\n00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.888\nBut as soon as that turns on, then I'll\nhave a video call open with Wes, and\n\n383\n00:18:17.888 --> 00:18:20.998\nhe'll be able to see me and\nwe can then communicate, chat, and\n\n384\n00:18:20.998 --> 00:18:23.690\nall that other great stuff,\njust like that.\n\n385\n00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.530\n>> With the archive, Don,\nyou said that you wouldn't really have to\n\n386\n00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.270\npurge it because it's not\nreally a big file size.\n\n387\n00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.421\nBut if you start dragging and\ndropping files,\n\n388\n00:18:31.421 --> 00:18:34.025\nis that gonna grow that\narchive exponentially faster?\n\n389\n00:18:34.025 --> 00:18:35.890\n>> Those don't actually\ngo through the server.\n\n390\n00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.320\nSo that is something that gets lost.\n\n391\n00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.143\nIt doesn't get archived.\n\n392\n00:18:40.143 --> 00:18:42.734\nUnless there's some crazy feature I\ndon't know about to turn that on,\n\n393\n00:18:42.734 --> 00:18:43.820\nit doesn't make it in there.\n\n394\n00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.940\nSo it is just kind of the text-based data.\n\n395\n00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.490\nSo that could be a problem.\n\n396\n00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.820\nThat could be a problem if you\nneed to keep a record of that too,\n\n397\n00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.320\nthen you may need some kind of\nalternative way to track it.\n\n398\n00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.770\nNow if I jump back over to my server,\nlet's talk about that archive.\n\n399\n00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.237\nSo on the server, we turn the archive on.\n\n400\n00:18:58.237 --> 00:19:02.589\nIf I go back here into messages, and I\nfind that Archive all messages option, and\n\n401\n00:19:02.589 --> 00:19:07.230\nShow in Finder, that when I jumped in\nhere earlier, it was completely empty.\n\n402\n00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:11.150\nNow I've got this\njabberd_user_messages.log.\n\n403\n00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.230\nThat's the current log file.\n\n404\n00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:17.440\nAnd every day it does a rollover and so\nit will split this off into a second file.\n\n405\n00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.600\nAnd so it will leave files behind for\neach day.\n\n406\n00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.760\nAnd so if I want to view somebody's\nmessages I find it here by day,\n\n407\n00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.560\nand then I go inside and its got\neverybody's messages, and I can go and\n\n408\n00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.620\nlook at them and find out what's what.\n\n409\n00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.840\nIf I were to open that log file,\nwell, I don't have permission,\n\n410\n00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.349\nso let me do it from a show\nwhere I can get permissions.\n\n411\n00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.734\nAnd then we'll be able to see that file.\n\n412\n00:19:38.734 --> 00:19:42.773\nWhoops, make that a little bit bigger for\nus.\n\n413\n00:19:42.773 --> 00:19:45.059\nSo I'm gonna get into\n\n414\n00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:51.950\n/Library/Server/Messages/Data/message_arc-\nhives.\n\n415\n00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:53.980\nAnd when you look in there,\nthere's that file.\n\n416\n00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:58.217\nAnd you've got to be\nan administrator to open it up, so\n\n417\n00:19:58.217 --> 00:20:00.808\nI'm going to do this as an admin.\n\n418\n00:20:00.808 --> 00:20:02.470\nAnd we can start to look inside of it.\n\n419\n00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:07.430\nSo right here I can see\nI had a chat from Wes\n\n420\n00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:12.800\ngoing to Don Pezet and\nhe said, here's a chat.\n\n421\n00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.000\nAnd then I responded back,\nNice to see you.\n\n422\n00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.790\nIt's all right here in the log files.\n\n423\n00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.990\nIt's keeping track of\nwhat client I was on.\n\n424\n00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.760\nIt's keeping track of what time it was,\nthe IP,\n\n425\n00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.330\nall of that information is being tucked\naway right in here, so that we can go and\n\n426\n00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:27.405\nreconstruct conversations and\nhave that record of it.\n\n427\n00:20:27.405 --> 00:20:30.315\nSo it's all kinda piled right in here.\n\n428\n00:20:30.315 --> 00:20:32.425\nNormally you probably wouldn't open\nthis straight up as a text file.\n\n429\n00:20:32.425 --> 00:20:34.825\nYou might load it in something else,\na spreadsheet, or whatever,\n\n430\n00:20:34.825 --> 00:20:37.175\nto be able to filter and\nfind information, but\n\n431\n00:20:37.175 --> 00:20:40.290\njust to be able to quickly view those\nchats, they're all logged right here.\n\n432\n00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:41.910\nDon, when it comes to troubleshooting,\n\n433\n00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:46.220\nspeaking of logs, you said that this\nservice could be very, very sensitive.\n\n434\n00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.480\nSo when it comes to troubleshooting,\nwhat's the first thing we do?\n\n435\n00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.472\nDo we create it a safe spot,\n\n436\n00:20:49.472 --> 00:20:51.683\nput the server there, so\nit's feelings don't get hurt or?\n\n437\n00:20:51.683 --> 00:20:53.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What's the first step?\n\n438\n00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.120\n>> All right, it is really sensitive.\n\n439\n00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.336\nIt is very easy to break this.\n\n440\n00:20:56.336 --> 00:20:59.020\nIn fact, for those of you watching\nrecorded, you didn't see it.\n\n441\n00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.592\nFor those of you who\nare watching the show live,\n\n442\n00:21:00.592 --> 00:21:02.964\nyou'll know that my server actually\nbroke right here during the show.\n\n443\n00:21:02.964 --> 00:21:05.493\nAnd what happens is,\nwhen you first install the server app,\n\n444\n00:21:05.493 --> 00:21:07.278\nit gathers a bunch of\nsettings together and\n\n445\n00:21:07.278 --> 00:21:10.460\nputs them in those text files that\nare hidden behind the scenes.\n\n446\n00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:13.970\nAnd then you can make changes to your\nserver that don't get reflected in those\n\n447\n00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.190\ntext files, and Jabber breaks.\n\n448\n00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:18.479\nAnd so when that happens,\nyou've got two choices.\n\n449\n00:21:18.479 --> 00:21:21.502\nOne, you can become an expert on\nJabber configuration and figure out\n\n450\n00:21:21.502 --> 00:21:24.702\nall the text files and the configuration,\nwhich is kind of a nightmare.\n\n451\n00:21:24.702 --> 00:21:29.194\nOr two, you can completely destroy\nthe Jabber service and let it rebuild, and\n\n452\n00:21:29.194 --> 00:21:33.630\nthat way it'll be nice and clean and\nthen actually functioning again.\n\n453\n00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:37.160\nAnd so in my case,\nI had brought up the server and\n\n454\n00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.830\nchanged its name after\nbringing up the server.\n\n455\n00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:43.040\nAnd so in all my config files, I had\nthe old name instead of the new name, and\n\n456\n00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.120\nthat really kind of\nmessed things up a bit.\n\n457\n00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.760\nAnd I could have just blown away\nthe Jabber service and recreated it, and\n\n458\n00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.990\nit would have the server's\nnew name in there.\n\n459\n00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.970\nIf you do that, make sure you back\nup your message archives first.\n\n460\n00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:56.810\nCuz the message archives\nare kind of important.\n\n461\n00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:57.600\nThey've got all that logs.\n\n462\n00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.670\nIf I blow it away,\nwe're gonna lose those archives.\n\n463\n00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.400\nSo if I just copy them\noff somewhere else and\n\n464\n00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.180\nthen blow it all away, then I'll still\nhave that record and I'm in good shape.\n\n465\n00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.370\nIf we want to see that,\nit's not not going to be on the exam, but\n\n466\n00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.710\nI put it in the show notes,\n\n467\n00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:14.990\nthe actual steps to go through to kind\nof rebuild the server if you need to.\n\n468\n00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:18.993\nI guess we have just a couple of minutes,\nbut, basically,\n\n469\n00:22:18.993 --> 00:22:21.003\nthe process works like this.\n\n470\n00:22:21.003 --> 00:22:23.644\nThe first thing is you need\nto stop the Jabber server.\n\n471\n00:22:23.644 --> 00:22:24.900\nYou need to get it to turn off.\n\n472\n00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:32.400\nSo I'm gonna do a serveradmin stop jabber.\n\n473\n00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.720\nAnd so\nthat's gonna shut down the Jabber service.\n\n474\n00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.500\nI could also go into the GUI and\nflip the off switch there.\n\n475\n00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.345\nSo, basically, you're gonna shut it down,\nand once it's shut down,\n\n476\n00:22:40.345 --> 00:22:43.960\nyou gotta delete all the stuff\nthat's tied to that Jabber server,\n\n477\n00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.810\nand, sadly, there's a lot of stuff.\n\n478\n00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:49.064\nIt's kind of spread out\nall over the place, and so\n\n479\n00:22:49.064 --> 00:22:53.572\none of the things that we have to wipe\nout is the private folder for it.\n\n480\n00:22:53.572 --> 00:22:56.400\nSo it has this temporary folder\nwhere it stores a lot of data.\n\n481\n00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:00.080\nIf I remove the service and try and\nput it back, this data's still there,\n\n482\n00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.248\nI have a bad configuration.\n\n483\n00:23:01.248 --> 00:23:07.385\nSo I've gotta kinda wipe that out,\nand so I'm gonna hit that real quick.\n\n484\n00:23:07.385 --> 00:23:09.390\nAnd this is a process identifier file, so\n\n485\n00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:13.190\nit's basically showing that jabberd was\nrunning, and so now I can kill that.\n\n486\n00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:14.460\nSo it's not running.\n\n487\n00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.325\nWe can wipe out its preferences,\nwhich is the next part.\n\n488\n00:23:18.325 --> 00:23:21.120\nAnd so that's gonna be\n\n489\n00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:28.903\n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.messageser-\nver.\n\n490\n00:23:28.903 --> 00:23:33.335\nActually I might not even have this file,\nbut it's messageserver.plist.\n\n491\n00:23:33.335 --> 00:23:34.795\nIt may not exist for you.\n\n492\n00:23:34.795 --> 00:23:37.630\nIn my case it doesn't exist, so\nI don't have to worry about that one.\n\n493\n00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:41.780\nThen we can get rid of all\nthe files that are tied to it,\n\n494\n00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:45.389\nwhich are in /Library/Server/Messages.\n\n495\n00:23:45.389 --> 00:23:49.320\nAnd so I'm just gonna wipe out everything\nin that directory, so that kills it.\n\n496\n00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.189\nAnd that, right there, is where I\nwould lose my message archive, and\n\n497\n00:23:52.189 --> 00:23:53.220\nthat would be a problem.\n\n498\n00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.740\nI just lost all this history.\n\n499\n00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.860\nWell, hopefully, you've got backup of your\nservers, so you can get it from a backup.\n\n500\n00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.320\nBut copy it somewhere else and\nthen blow this directory away.\n\n501\n00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.960\nAnd then the last thing we need to\ndo is to put it all back again.\n\n502\n00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.730\nSo what I just did is I just\nkilled the Jabber service.\n\n503\n00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:09.441\nIt's now gone.\n\n504\n00:24:09.441 --> 00:24:12.197\nAll its configuration files,\nall its other data is gone.\n\n505\n00:24:12.197 --> 00:24:13.614\nNow I need to put it back.\n\n506\n00:24:13.614 --> 00:24:16.726\nWell Apple actually has\na script to put it back.\n\n507\n00:24:16.726 --> 00:24:21.983\nIt's a part of the server app,\nand so if I run\n\n508\n00:24:21.983 --> 00:24:30.379\n/Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerR-\noot/System,\n\n509\n00:24:30.379 --> 00:24:35.780\nit's a bit of a long one, /library, oops,\n\n510\n00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:40.945\nno, sorry, I'm going to the wrong spot.\n\n511\n00:24:40.945 --> 00:24:48.409\n/ServerRoot, there we go, /usr,\nbecause it's a user file,\n\n512\n00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:55.641\n/libexec/copy_message_server_config_files-\n.sh.\n\n513\n00:24:55.641 --> 00:24:59.330\nIt's a script that Apple has\npackaged specifically for\n\n514\n00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:03.830\nthis purpose, to put all the messages\nback to the way that it's supposed to be\n\n515\n00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:06.010\nafter you've killed off\nwhat was already there.\n\n516\n00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:09.880\nSo I'm gonna call this script and\nit's gonna run, doesn't take long and\n\n517\n00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.570\nit's gonna put default\nconfiguration files back.\n\n518\n00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.710\nAnd this way,\nif I've changed a server name or\n\n519\n00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.100\nwhatever, when I launch\nthis jabber daemon,\n\n520\n00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.710\nagain, it's gonna grab the new data,\npopulate it, and have it correct.\n\n521\n00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:22.680\nAnd so this would have fixed\nthe problem that I had earlier,\n\n522\n00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.800\nif I had been more patient.\n\n523\n00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.130\nSo [COUGH] I can punch this in.\n\n524\n00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:27.450\nNow those are recreated.\n\n525\n00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:31.530\nThe last thing I need to do is\nactually fire up the jabber daemon and\n\n526\n00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.980\ntell it to populate its data for\nthe first time and so\n\n527\n00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.370\nwe have to use the launch controller for\nthat.\n\n528\n00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:41.990\nThis is kind of a weird thing to do but\nwe're gonna use launchctl\n\n529\n00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:46.080\nload -w and then we can point\nit to a preference file and\n\n530\n00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.480\nit is going to tell it to launch and\nconfigure itself and get in business.\n\n531\n00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.130\nNow this is actually\nregistering it to launch, and\n\n532\n00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:57.030\nthen we'll use the server admin\ncommand to actually start it.\n\n533\n00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:01.028\nSo when I point to this file, which is in\n\n534\n00:26:01.028 --> 00:26:11.028\n/Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerR-\noot/System\n\n535\n00:26:12.316 --> 00:26:20.857\n/library/launchdaemons/org.jabber.jabberd-\n\n536\n00:26:20.857 --> 00:26:23.810\n.plist, right?\n\n537\n00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:25.910\nSo it's a preference list\nthat I'm pointing to.\n\n538\n00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:29.290\nIt's gonna register that to\nbe a runnable service now.\n\n539\n00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:30.900\nAnd so now I know about it.\n\n540\n00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:37.100\nAnd I can do a sudo\nserveradmin start jabber.\n\n541\n00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.890\nAll right, and that's gonna start it.\n\n542\n00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:42.440\nSo now it's a completely clean\njabber system that comes up.\n\n543\n00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.640\nAnd it's sad, I've had to do this a lot.\n\n544\n00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.820\nAnd all of those steps\nare in the show notes, so\n\n545\n00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.150\ndon't feel like you gotta\njot all those down.\n\n546\n00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:50.750\nIt's all in the show notes,\nand you can get it.\n\n547\n00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:55.580\nI keep them handy because anytime that I\nhave a messages server that dies on me,\n\n548\n00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.350\nthis is usually what I end up doing.\n\n549\n00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:59.490\nYou can try and\nmuck about in all the text files and\n\n550\n00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:03.660\ntry and find the configuration and sort\nthe messaging, the errors, and all that.\n\n551\n00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.890\nBut it's really hard.\n\n552\n00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:06.370\nAnd they don't make it easy.\n\n553\n00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:07.940\nAnd it's so sensitive.\n\n554\n00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:12.480\nThe only real data you have on the jabber\nserver to worry about is your archive.\n\n555\n00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.600\nSo you just copy your archive\nout somewhere else and\n\n556\n00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.980\nyou run those steps that\nI just showed you and\n\n557\n00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.180\nit blows away the entire jabber service,\nmakes it nice and clean.\n\n558\n00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:22.380\nNow it's up and running and healthy\nagain and you get people to connect.\n\n559\n00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.520\nDo double check to make sure\nthe archive is still turned on.\n\n560\n00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.330\nSo in the server app, I'm gonna go here\nand refresh my messages screen and\n\n561\n00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:32.400\nnotice, Archive all messages is turned\noff because that's the default.\n\n562\n00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.030\nI'm back to all defaults.\n\n563\n00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:38.240\nSo I need to turn that back on, but\nthe other stuff is already there.\n\n564\n00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.190\nNow we're fine, okay.\n\n565\n00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.675\nSo that was really the only one thing\nthat I had to do after blowing it away.\n\n566\n00:27:42.675 --> 00:27:43.435\nThat's how simple it is.\n\n567\n00:27:43.435 --> 00:27:45.005\nAnd that's why this is\nkinda my default go to.\n\n568\n00:27:45.005 --> 00:27:47.125\nIf I have problems, this is what I do.\n\n569\n00:27:47.125 --> 00:27:48.855\n>> Very simplistic to set that up, Donald.\n\n570\n00:27:48.855 --> 00:27:50.225\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Do appreciate that.\n\n571\n00:27:50.225 --> 00:27:54.785\nNow even more so, the real world scenario\nwhich maybe wasn't quite so simplistic.\n\n572\n00:27:54.785 --> 00:27:55.785\nBut it is good to see that,\n\n573\n00:27:55.785 --> 00:27:59.095\nknow what you're gonna do in maybe\nyour Enterprise environment.\n\n574\n00:27:59.095 --> 00:28:00.025\nNow Don, looking at the time,\n\n575\n00:28:00.025 --> 00:28:03.015\ndoes look like we're creeping up on\nthe end of another episode here.\n\n576\n00:28:03.015 --> 00:28:05.470\nBut before we go,\ndo you have any additional words?\n\n577\n00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:06.650\n>> Just be aware.\n\n578\n00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:07.790\nI mean, it is really sensitive.\n\n579\n00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:09.830\nI don't mean to talk\nbad about the product.\n\n580\n00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.270\nAll the other services are so easy.\n\n581\n00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:13.100\nYou flip a switch and\nthen they're on and that's it.\n\n582\n00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.930\nBut this one, this one's sensitive.\n\n583\n00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:16.250\nSo you might want to\nconsider not using it.\n\n584\n00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:17.800\nYou might want to consider\na third party product.\n\n585\n00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.350\nThere's plenty of them that out there.\n\n586\n00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.020\nBut this is the one that's on the exam.\n\n587\n00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.090\nSo be aware of it.\n\n588\n00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:23.380\nMain thing to remember.\n\n589\n00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:26.230\nThe easy one that people get wrong\non the exam is that XMPP and\n\n590\n00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:28.960\njabber are the same thing,\ninterchangeable terms.\n\n591\n00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.510\n>> Thank you, Don.\n\n592\n00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:32.460\nWe appreciate that, and we appreciate you,\nthe viewer, out there for watching.\n\n593\n00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.550\nSign out for ITProtv,\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n594\n00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:36.190\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n595\n00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.206\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n596\n00:28:38.206 --> 00:28:46.060\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n",
