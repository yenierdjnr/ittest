we're\ngonna go over what exactly are we gonna\n\n6\n00:00:19.893 --> 00:00:22.706\nbe covering in this series,\nwho is this for?\n\n7\n00:00:22.706 --> 00:00:25.499\nWhat are some other things I

providing for you.\n\n10\n00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:34.193\n[LAUGH] What are we going to\nbe covering in this show?\n\n11\n00:00:34.193 --> 00:00:38.494\nWe're gonna be talking about the basic\nintroduction to what is email?\n\n12\n00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:40.420\nAnd what does it mean when they say SMTP?\n\n13\n00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.680\nAnd what is a server,\nwhat is all this terminology?\n\n14\n00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.210\nBecause that's really the name of\nthe game to really get started.\n\n15\n00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.720\nAnd to really feel comfortable knowing\nwhat you're talking about when you're,\n\n16\n00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.120\nwell, talking about email.\n\n17\n00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.832\nThat is one of the things that\nOutlook is well known for.\n\n18\n00:00:55.832 --> 00:00:58.577\nAnd we're going to be sending and\nreceiving emails,\n\n19\n00:00:58.577 --> 00:01:00.714\ngoing through formatting our messages.\n\n20\n00:01:00.714 --> 00:01:05.510\nAdvanced functions of our options\nthat we can add in our emails, and\n\n21\n00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.100\neverything you can know about for\nemailing other people.\n\n22\n00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.592\nWe also have the section in Outlook for\ncalendar, we'll make sure we're organized.\n\n23\n00:01:14.592 --> 00:01:16.938\nWe're gonna be adding appointments and\nmeetings.\n\n24\n00:01:16.938 --> 00:01:20.503\nWe're also gonna be sharing our\ncalendars with other people.\n\n25\n00:01:20.503 --> 00:01:24.900\nContacts, that's a huge thing\nin our industry with an office.\n\n26\n00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.940\nYou need to know who you're talking to and\n\n27\n00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.190\nhaving those business cards on hand to\nbe able to virtually hand out to people.\n\n28\n00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.270\nWe'll be covering all of those different\ntopics within our context area.\n\n29\n00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.441\nTasks and Notes,\nwe wanna make sure we stay on task.\n\n30\n00:01:39.441 --> 00:01:43.016\nI love a to do list, and I love to\ncross that off so we can go ahead and\n\n31\n00:01:43.016 --> 00:01:45.740\ndo that virtually as well through Outlook.\n\n32\n00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.610\nAnd add little sticky notes here and\nthere to just I have a note for our self.\n\n33\n00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.530\nIn the wonderful world of groups,\nworking in collaboration that's of course\n\n34\n00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.340\nwhat Office365 is really kind\nof wants to get in with you.\n\n35\n00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.906\nThey wanna be able to give you\nall the different tools for\n\n36\n00:02:01.906 --> 00:02:03.333\nyou to collaborate as a group.\n\n37\n00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:06.287\nAnd so you can do that right\nhere through Outlook and\n\n38\n00:02:06.287 --> 00:02:09.250\nnot even have to hopefully\ncontact your IT person.\n\n39\n00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.305\nWho is this for?\n\n40\n00:02:11.305 --> 00:02:13.490\nThis is for all Office users.\n\n41\n00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.900\nAnd when I say Office,\n\n42\n00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.000\nI'm not necessarily always referring\nto the product of Microsoft Office.\n\n43\n00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.474\nIf you're in a working environment,\nwhether it's in a large organization or\n\n44\n00:02:23.474 --> 00:02:24.830\na small organization,\n\n45\n00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.403\nusing Outlook is going to be like the\nlynch pin in all different organizations.\n\n46\n00:02:29.403 --> 00:02:31.628\nBig and small to keep you organized, and\n\n47\n00:02:31.628 --> 00:02:34.600\nto keep you communicating\nwith other people.\n\n48\n00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.570\nThis starts from the very,\nvery beginning of what is an email and\n\n49\n00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.882\nwhat is a server like I\nsaid in that introduction.\n\n50\n00:02:39.882 --> 00:02:44.762\nIt goes all the way to the advanced\nfeatures of going through the options\n\n51\n00:02:44.762 --> 00:02:47.772\nwithin Outlook talking about some higher,\n\n52\n00:02:47.772 --> 00:02:53.400\nif you wanna say level topics to really be\nable to maximize the use of this product.\n\n53\n00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.304\nWhat do I need to know\nbefore I get started?\n\n54\n00:02:57.304 --> 00:03:00.128\nNot much.\nIf you've never use Outlook before\n\n55\n00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:01.163\nthat's fine.\n\n56\n00:03:01.163 --> 00:03:05.265\nNow if you've had familiarity with some\nother Office products may be you know Word\n\n57\n00:03:05.265 --> 00:03:07.232\nreally well or used Excel really well.\n\n58\n00:03:07.232 --> 00:03:12.192\nMaybe you're coming over from using Google\nor Yahoo or some Internet based email.\n\n59\n00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:16.644\nAnd you're now required to use Outlook\nthat can be some great help for\n\n60\n00:03:16.644 --> 00:03:19.962\nyou to be able to get\nsomewhat of your familiarity.\n\n61\n00:03:19.962 --> 00:03:23.141\nBut if you've never used it\nbefore this is the show for you.\n\n62\n00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:26.603\nKnowing some of those basic windows,\nlike when to right click,\n\n63\n00:03:26.603 --> 00:03:30.912\ndouble clicking, your windows operating\nsystem, where is the start button.\n\n64\n00:03:30.912 --> 00:03:35.280\nThose are some things that would be\nprerequisite for this particular show.\n\n65\n00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.530\nAny extras,\nwell there's always other options\n\n66\n00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.490\nI might show you to do a specific\nfunction in outlook by clicking a button.\n\n67\n00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.778\nBut someone might come, do you know that\nyou could right click on that or do you\n\n68\n00:03:47.778 --> 00:03:51.086\nknow if you do a triple loop and stand on\nyour head you could do the same thing too.\n\n69\n00:03:51.086 --> 00:03:55.656\nYes, that is true there are lots of\ndifferent was to do the same thing in any\n\n70\n00:03:55.656 --> 00:03:59.160\nproduct and outlook is none the different.\n\n71\n00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.950\nUpdates happen,\nyes these products update all the time.\n\n72\n00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.809\nAnd so at the time your watching this show\nthere might have been a update that there\n\n73\n00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:12.325\nis a new button or\na new feature that is not covered in here.\n\n74\n00:04:12.325 --> 00:04:16.791\nWell that's because they're always doing\nthat with your Office365 subscription,\n\n75\n00:04:16.791 --> 00:04:20.899\nthat's the beauty of having a subscription\nbased product is that your constantly\n\n76\n00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.160\ngetting those updates.\n\n77\n00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.180\nI don't have all the answers for you but\n\n78\n00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.570\nthere is the wide world of internet out\nthere for you to search for your answers.\n\n79\n00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.889\nMicrosoft Office support websites they\nreally help you and they've shown us with\n\n80\n00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.222\neach ones of these episodes do have a lot\nof references to those particular sites.\n\n81\n00:04:40.222 --> 00:04:43.660\nThat Microsoft is not the only people\nthat know about their products.\n\n82\n00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.135\nSo definitely go ahead and\n\n83\n00:04:45.135 --> 00:04:50.042\nsearch that Internet to find that answer\nthat you're looking for, that's what I do.\n\n84\n00:04:50.042 --> 00:04:53.011\nEvery server is different,\nevery organization is different.\n\n85\n00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:58.004\nAnd every organization has different\nadministrative settings, and access,\n\n86\n00:04:58.004 --> 00:05:00.471\nand privileges, and group policies.\n\n87\n00:05:00.471 --> 00:05:03.930\nAnd we can start talking techie but\neverybody is different.\n\n88\n00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.550\nSo if there's something that I show in an\nepisode that you're like you click on it.\n\n89\n00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.125\nAnd like I don't even have\nthat option it's grayed out.\n\n90\n00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:13.957\nTalk to your IT people there might be\na reason of why you can't do that.\n\n91\n00:05:13.957 --> 00:05:17.108\nAnd of course above all\nhave fun with this.\n\n92\n00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:21.803\nI know it can get frustrating of not\nknowing why it's doing something or\n\n93\n00:05:21.803 --> 00:05:25.300\nnot doing something I\nexperience it all the time.\n\n94\n00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.280\nBut in the grand scheme of\nthings just keep an open mind,\n\n95\n00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.380\ntry to have fun with it.\n\n96\n00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.720\nBecause once you get familiar I think\nyou can know how to use a product.\n\n97\n00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.300\nOnce you know something it\nbecomes a lot more enjoyable.\n\n98\n00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.352\nSo with that I hope you have a great time\nin this episode, and I'll see you soon.\n\n99\n00:05:46.353 --> 00:05:49.376\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

I may have my day planner with\nthe stamps in it which probably\n\n41\n00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.950\ndon't work anymore.\n\n42\n00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.950\n&gt;&gt; Then actually we have a rolex.\n\n43\n00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.933\nCuz I mean not that you're\ncarrying around a Rolodex.\n\n44\n00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:48.183\nBut what I'm trying to get around\nhere to is that your day planners and\n\n45\n00:01:48.183 --> 00:01:51.261\nall the things we used to\ndo through pen and paper,\n\n46\n00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:55.255\nwhich I still actually print out\ncalendars and write them down.\n\n47\n00:01:55.255 --> 00:01:55.796\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes you do.\n\n48\n00:01:55.796 --> 00:01:57.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I do you've seen them.\n\n49\n00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.400\nWell, all of these things that\nyou can do with mailing letters,\n\n50\n00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.920\nor now I guess you could said e-mail,\nand then your to-do list, and\n\n51\n00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.890\nyour contacts, that's all Outlook,\nthat's what Outlook does.\n\n52\n00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.620\nAnd so, when you hear the word Outlook,\n\n53\n00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.200\nyou can think of it in\na couple different ways.\n\n54\n00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.360\nSo I have a slide here that kind of\njust demonstrates because Outlook is,\n\n55\n00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.860\nit's almost like a brand name.\n\n56\n00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.020\nWhen you hear the brand name of Outlook,\nit's not just one thing.\n\n57\n00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.260\nIts Outlook as in Outlook 2016.\n\n58\n00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.910\nA locally installed product in\nthe Office 365 subscription\n\n59\n00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.900\nmodel like word, Powerpoint,\nOutlook, those are a program.\n\n60\n00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.920\nSo its an application that you use to go\nahead and do things like emailing but\n\n61\n00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.160\ntheres also something called\noutlook.com so there's that name.\n\n62\n00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.230\nAnd then,\nthere's Outlook Web Access, or OWA.\n\n63\n00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.660\nSo how are these different?\n\n64\n00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.490\nWell, Outlook.com is web-based.\n\n65\n00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.940\nOutlook is a program, and\nOWA is web-based as well, but we're\n\n66\n00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.730\ngonna go through some of all of these\npieces and a little bit more in depth.\n\n67\n00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.550\nSo let's kinda get a starting point as to\nwhere we're at in this particular show.\n\n68\n00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.885\nThis is Outlook, Outlook is,\nlike I said a locally.\n\n69\n00:03:13.885 --> 00:03:19.035\n[LAUGH] A locally installed version\nof this particular application.\n\n70\n00:03:19.035 --> 00:03:21.975\nIt is used for emailing in your calendars.\n\n71\n00:03:21.975 --> 00:03:23.465\nYou download it to your computer, so\n\n72\n00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:27.177\nthat way you go to your\nOffice 365 account install.\n\n73\n00:03:27.177 --> 00:03:31.975\nThe OfficeSuite usually has\nan entire suite of applications but\n\n74\n00:03:31.975 --> 00:03:35.645\nyou could go ahead and I guess locally\ninstall just Outlook if you wanted to and\n\n75\n00:03:35.645 --> 00:03:38.605\nit's going to give you all of\nthe full features of Outlook.\n\n76\n00:03:38.605 --> 00:03:42.560\nSo this is going to be\nthe most robust version\n\n77\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.210\nof Outlook is your locally\ninstalled application here.\n\n78\n00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.890\nIt is part of the Office 365 like we said,\nso it will come as a package.\n\n79\n00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.710\nThere's a bunch of\ndifferent product plans, or\n\n80\n00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.936\nsubscription models,\nthat you can use in Office 365.\n\n81\n00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.660\nThere's so many of them, right, Ronnie?\n\n82\n00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.190\n&gt;&gt; There are.\n&gt;&gt; And there's the ones for\n\n83\n00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.830\njust your home, business,\nand education you can see.\n\n84\n00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.710\nBut then you have your business models and\nyour enterprise versions.\n\n85\n00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.820\nThere's 3s and 5s and lots and\nlots of different versions of them.\n\n86\n00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.340\nBut I think almost every single\none of them Comes with Outlook.\n\n87\n00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.030\nWell, I say that and then the account that\n\n88\n00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.500\nI use to demo a lot of these products,\nhis name is JT for Justin Timberlake.\n\n89\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.410\nJT's account didn't have Outlook.\n\n90\n00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it originally didn't, but\n\n91\n00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.880\nyou can actually,\neven if you don't have it, right?\n\n92\n00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.710\nAnd you set up an account like this and\nyou want it.\n\n93\n00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.560\nYou normally can get\nthat account upgraded.\n\n94\n00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.550\nAnd then once you get it upgraded,\nthen you can install it.\n\n95\n00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.110\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we had to do actually,\nI had to talk to my IT department,\n\n96\n00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.770\nif we were to say here.\n\n97\n00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.465\nAnd say hey, you know what?\n\n98\n00:04:45.465 --> 00:04:50.530\nI wanna use JT in using for\nmy Outlook program or my Outlook show.\n\n99\n00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.920\nCan we go ahead and\njust extend Outlook and\n\n100\n00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.500\nthe emailing services if you would say in\nthat particular Office subscription and\n\n101\n00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.290\nDon like yep, he went in did some\nthings and he is like okay you are set.\n\n102\n00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.260\nI'm like perfect and\nI logged in and now JT has email.\n\n103\n00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.460\nSo I guess you always has an account but\nwe'll get to that in just a sec and\n\n104\n00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.720\nit was really just the availability\nof Outlook to be part\n\n105\n00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.350\nof The whole subscription that I,\nas JT, had.\n\n106\n00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.100\nSo if you don't have it just\ncheck with your IT department.\n\n107\n00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.040\nOr if you don't have an IT department\nyou can always contact Outlook.\n\n108\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.020\nOutlook?\n\n109\n00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.075\nOffice, Microsoft, that is.\n\n110\n00:05:28.075 --> 00:05:30.740\n[LAUGH] And be able to clarify that, so.\n\n111\n00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.578\n&gt;&gt; You have a couple of\ndifferent models here, right?\n\n112\n00:05:33.578 --> 00:05:38.430\nSometimes your brand-new computer may come\nwith the trial version of Office itself\n\n113\n00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.880\nand it may allow you to\ninstall Outlook right then.\n\n114\n00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.490\nOr you might find out that you can go\ndirectly to the Office 365 website and\n\n115\n00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.470\njust pick and choose which one you want.\n\n116\n00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.600\nAnd as long as it says Outlook\nis available for download and\n\n117\n00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.560\ninstallation on that local computer,\nyou can also get it that way.\n\n118\n00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.050\nSo you have many options for\ngetting it on to your computer.\n\n119\n00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.250\nBut the key here is just to remember that\nyou need it on your computer if you wanna\n\n120\n00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.360\nlearn more about Outlook.\n\n121\n00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.380\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes, and\nthat's because you'll see I\n\n122\n00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.140\nmight be jumping a little bit ahead\nof my slideshow presentation but\n\n123\n00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.230\nthat is what we're going to be\nteaching this particular show.\n\n124\n00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.400\nThis is an Outlook 2016 this is going\nto be a low clean installed version\n\n125\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.930\nof the application with it's full\ncapabilities of what Outlook\n\n126\n00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.440\ncan do for you.\n\n127\n00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.660\nBut let's step into the next\none that have Outlook.com we've\n\n128\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.755\nestablished that Outlook is\nthe program that you locally install.\n\n129\n00:06:29.755 --> 00:06:33.800\nOutlook.com is what you access\nthrough your web browser.\n\n130\n00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.961\nAnd this could be either a free or\nan account that you have with Office365.\n\n131\n00:06:39.961 --> 00:06:44.620\nAnd I have the different log ins that,\nthey pretty much all go to the same place.\n\n132\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.120\nBut it will have most of your features.\n\n133\n00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.051\nBut this is a web-based Interface for\nyou to use for your email,\n\n134\n00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:57.094\nis very similar to if your familiar with\nthat Gmail or you have a Yahoo account.\n\n135\n00:06:57.094 --> 00:07:00.356\nSo any of those web-based\nemail subscription or\n\n136\n00:07:00.356 --> 00:07:04.020\nemail client since it's not\na client it's a service.\n\n137\n00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.650\nTry to use the correct terminology here\nbecause a lot of times we use all of these\n\n138\n00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.060\nwords interchangeable.\n\n139\n00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.220\nAnd we're saying email client but\nit's really not\n\n140\n00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.150\nclient because it's really a web service\nand you go through your web browser.\n\n141\n00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.960\nAnd whether or not you even know\nwhat the definition of client means,\n\n142\n00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.920\ndon't worry about it.\n\n143\n00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.345\nJust know that Outlook.com is the one that\nyou would actually have to go to your\n\n144\n00:07:24.345 --> 00:07:28.504\ncomputer, be connected to the internet\nLog on through your web browser,\n\n145\n00:07:28.504 --> 00:07:31.142\nto your account and\nuse this interface there.\n\n146\n00:07:31.142 --> 00:07:32.868\nTo be able to send, receive,\n\n147\n00:07:32.868 --> 00:07:37.494\nadd your attachments do all the things\nthat you would do in outlook or emailing,\n\n148\n00:07:37.494 --> 00:07:41.460\nor calendars or tasks,\nanything like that on your browser.\n\n149\n00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.040\nNot the locally installed\noutlook on your machine.\n\n150\n00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.370\nNow, I wanna throw this\nslide in here because\n\n151\n00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.980\nif any of you all have a Hotmail account,\ndid you have a Hotmail account?\n\n152\n00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.400\n&gt;&gt;

Early 90s.\n\n160\n00:08:09.744 --> 00:08:14.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so it became MSN Hotmail and\nthen Windows Live Hotmail.\n\n161\n00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.350\nWell, all of that has become Outlook.com.\n\n162\n00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.688\nOkay, so if you had a Hotmail, you can\nactually probably still use your email\n\n163\n00:08:21.688 --> 00:08:24.375\naddress just kinda like\nI know people have AOL.\n\n164\n00:08:24.375 --> 00:08:28.430\nAnd I mean, it still exists and it's\nstill around and that's your email, but\n\n165\n00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:32.160\nit really does belong to Microsoft and\nthat this is what Outlook.com.\n\n166\n00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.850\nSo that's the progression and\nwhere this is kinda coming from.\n\n167\n00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.890\nAnd while I'm on this slide,\nlike the Windows Live.\n\n168\n00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.430\nAnd I have this MSN,\nthere's like the little butterfly and\n\n169\n00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:45.240\nall these different things that Microsoft\nhas done throughout the years that's kinda\n\n170\n00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.640\nchanged along the way of how\nthey've branded themself.\n\n171\n00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.530\nAnd what they call things.\n\n172\n00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.210\nAnd sometimes it's kind of hard to\nkeep up with all of these things.\n\n173\n00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.880\nCuz like you now have your,\n\n174\n00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.010\nI think they just call it a Microsoft\naccount, I think that's what your Office.\n\n175\n00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.030\nBut it used to be Office Live,\n\n176\n00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.870\nWindows Live, they had different names for\nall of this stuff.\n\n177\n00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.680\nAnd so,\nI wannsto throw in this website here.\n\n178\n00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.810\nAnd this is in the show notes and\n\n179\n00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.720\nthis is actually in the speaker\nnotes of the PowerPoint presentation\n\n180\n00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.760\nthat should be attached to this\nepisode on the website here.\n\n181\n00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.050\nSo I just wanna show\nlike right here the ID.\n\n182\n00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.770\nWe used to be like if your\nMicrosoft account and\n\n183\n00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.900\nthey used to call it like Microsoft Live,\nand\n\n184\n00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.940\nthis is just a really great website\nto go through all the things of.\n\n185\n00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.445\nWhat they used to be called and\nwhat they're called now like OneDrive.\n\n186\n00:09:31.445 --> 00:09:35.990\nOneDrive is a program that you can\nuse as kind of like a cloud based\n\n187\n00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:39.320\nplace to store your files,\nthey used to call it Sky Drive.\n\n188\n00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.025\nI remembered that when I looked\nat this website I thought \" yeah,\n\n189\n00:09:42.025 --> 00:09:43.220\nI remember SkyDrive, okay.\n\n190\n00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.200\nWell, it's really just One Drive.\n\n191\n00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.100\nAnd like the messaging that you\nused to have, that's now Skype.\n\n192\n00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.440\nBecause Microsoft bought Skype.\n\n193\n00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.400\nSo this website just kinda in Wikipedia\ngives you all of these different\n\n194\n00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.430\nthings that you can go through to see what\nwas its name before, what's its name now.\n\n195\n00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.280\nLike Messenger is now replaced with Skype.\n\n196\n00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.410\nCertain things are, remember Movie Maker?\n\n197\n00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.030\nI remember good old Movie Maker.\n\n198\n00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.723\nLet's discontinue, so just check this\nwebsite out in this page just to kinda get\n\n199\n00:10:10.723 --> 00:10:13.081\nyou familiar with all the terminology.\n\n200\n00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:16.914\nSo when you see Windows Live is\nreally actually if you go a way,\n\n201\n00:10:16.914 --> 00:10:20.843\nit is a discontinued brand name,\nbut it did exist at one point.\n\n202\n00:10:20.843 --> 00:10:23.257\nSo if you are kind like\nwhere did it ever go?\n\n203\n00:10:23.257 --> 00:10:25.711\nIt's still there, it's look loke were go?\n\n204\n00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:27.160\n&gt;&gt; It's still there,\nthey just renamed it, so.\n\n205\n00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.470\nNice little tidbit for you right there.\n\n206\n00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.030\nAll right,\nwhat do I have on my next slide?\n\n207\n00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.490\nOkay.\n[LAUGH] We have OWA.\n\n208\n00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.780\nNow, OWA is Outlook Web Access.\n\n209\n00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.065\nIt's like well, wait a second?\n\n210\n00:10:41.065 --> 00:10:43.130\n[LAUGH] Isn't that what\nwe just talked about?\n\n211\n00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:48.280\nIsn't Outlook.com the place where you Go\nthrough your web browser and go through\n\n212\n00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.070\nyour email, this is the same thing to it\nsays access through your web browser.\n\n213\n00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.570\nIt's like well then what's the difference?\n\n214\n00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:56.250\nIt's my favorite saying,\nit's the same but different.\n\n215\n00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:00.280\nSo you're still accessing your email, and\n\n216\n00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.730\nthe things in Outlook\nthrough a web browser.\n\n217\n00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.770\nBut OWA specifically, it's more for\n\n218\n00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.330\nanybody that's on\na Microsoft exchange server.\n\n219\n00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.380\nFor example, when I used to work\nat a university here in town,\n\n220\n00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.970\nwe had to go to mail.ufl.edu.\n\n221\n00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.830\nThat was the place where you would go to\n\n222\n00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:25.300\nwhen you were not in your office\nto be able to access your mail.\n\n223\n00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:29.910\nAnd that's where it was connected to\na very large Microsoft Exchange Server.\n\n224\n00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:36.270\nAnd so, this was my condo if you wanna say\nto getting into my Outlook through OWA.\n\n225\n00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:39.850\nAnd so it really just depends on\nhow your organization's set up\n\n226\n00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.530\nIf you're an Exchange Server\nyou might see this.\n\n227\n00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:46.564\nOr you might be on an Exchange Server and\nnot even use this and still just go\n\n228\n00:11:46.564 --> 00:11:51.280\nthrough the regular log in that you would\ngo to like your own personal Office 365.\n\n229\n00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.570\nSo it's one in the same,\nbut it's kind of not.\n\n230\n00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when it comes down to it right,\nthere's a couple of different things here.\n\n231\n00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.890\nThe Outlook.com usually individuals,\nor maybe even small\n\n232\n00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:08.710\ncompanies that say, I don't really\nneed to manage my own e-mail.\n\n233\n00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.910\nI don't need to have that much control,\nI just need e-mail.\n\n234\n00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.580\nWell, that works in the system, just like\nyou might hear of other systems that\n\n235\n00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.420\nare out there, like Gmail,\nlike what you were mentioning before.\n\n236\n00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.720\nOther ones, Yahoo!\n\n237\n00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.558\nThey operate essentially email service,\nbut there are times\n\n238\n00:12:23.558 --> 00:12:28.450\nthat a company itself says I need to have\nmore control and I need to manage this.\n\n239\n00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.318\nBut I still need the same features as\nsomething like outlook.com where people\n\n240\n00:12:32.318 --> 00:12:35.410\ncan gain access to it\nregardless of where they go.\n\n241\n00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.402\nThat's when you're going\nto connect to OWA instead.\n\n242\n00:12:38.402 --> 00:12:42.930\nSo Outlook.com, it will work for\nyou connecting into\n\n243\n00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:47.490\na personal email server or if your company\nsays, I'm not managing my own email.\n\n244\n00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.020\nYou might connect through there, and\n\n245\n00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.550\neven though you might share your\ncompany's domain name; in other words,\n\n246\n00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:56.800\nthe same part to the right of the 'at'\nsymbol for your email address.\n\n247\n00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.870\nWhereas this one,\nthe central background difference is,\n\n248\n00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:05.460\nI'm gonna be the one that's managing\nthose servers, handling all the emails.\n\n249\n00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.350\nSo when you connect in that,\n\n250\n00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.410\nyou're looking at what you're seeing\nover there on the left hand side.\n\n251\n00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.390\nNormally when you connect to that website,\n\n252\n00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.100\nlike what Vaughn was talking about with\nthe university, or you're actually going\n\n253\n00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.250\nto be connecting to something that\nlooks like that blue thing right there.\n\n254\n00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.770\nAnd you're directly connecting\nto your business portal,\n\n255\n00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:23.310\nis what that one's called.\n\n256\n00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:27.190\nAnd that will allow you to also gain\naccess to there and more tools.\n\n257\n00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.860\nThe Outlook Web access only really for\nemail and for Outlook.\n\n258\n00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.830\nBut whereas the other one, it may give\nyou access to even more information and\n\n259\n00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.640\nmore tools that you'll have available.\n\n260\n00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.970\nSo that's really the big distinguishing\ndifference between them.\n\n261\n00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and I know you've actually set\nup an exchange server here or there.\n\n262\n00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:44.270\nBecause I know that you do that.\n\n263\n00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.790\nYou do episodes, and\nyou do whole shows on Microsoft.\n\n264\n00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.320\nExchange and Office 365 as an admin.\n\n265\n00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:55.180\nSo like he's saying, it really depends on\nwho is administrating your servers and\n\n266\n00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.300\nwe have another episode after this,\n\n267\n00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.610\nif you're watching in sequential order,\nthat is going to be talking about.\n\n268\n00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:04.490\nExchange and a little bit more,\nwhat is it versus IMAP and POP and\n\n269\n00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.300\nsome of those different terminologies\nthat you're going to be hearing when\n\n270\n00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.840\nassociating with emailing and\nservers and clients.\n\n271\n00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.690\nSo yeah, does somebody else manage it or\ndoes your company manage it?\n\n272\n00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.200\nLarge university like\nUniversity of Florida,\n\n273\n00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.920\nthey have multiple exchange servers and\nmultiple different colleges had it.\n\n274\n00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.669\nSo that's what we have here and\nthat's what OWA is.\n\n275\n00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:29.680\nLike I said I jumped a little bit ahead\nour set up in this particular series we're\n\n276\n00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.475\ngoing to be doing outlook.\n\n277\n00:14:32.475 --> 00:14:36.410\n[LAUGH] We are doing Outlook\n2016 a locally installed version\n\n278\n00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:40.420\nof this product we're gonna have all\nthe full capabilities of Outlook.\n\n279\n00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:45.500\nAnd we are using Windows 10 pro it\nis a 64 bit operating system so and\n\n280\n00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.890\nby the way my account is set\nup as an Office 365 ProPlus.\n\n281\n00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.970\nBut actually we upgraded\nit to an E3 didn't we.\n\n282\n00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.964\n&gt;&gt; We did and\nthat's still the same licensing for\n\n283\n00:14:53.964 --> 00:14:58.438\nOffice 2016 that you download\nfrom your Office 365 account.\n\n284\n00:14:58.438 --> 00:15:01.940\nAnd that just goes onto your machine and\nyou let it install.\n\n285\n00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.035\nAnd once it installs and you run it,\nyou'll see the very first thing that pops\n\n286\n00:15:06.035 --> 00:15:10.067\nup is Outlook 2016, is what'll pop up,\nso that is just the version, or\n\n287\n00:15:10.067 --> 00:15:14.673\nthe licensing version, that you'll see\nthere, when you see Office 365 ProPlus.\n\n288\n00:15:14.673 --> 00:15:17.145\n&gt;&gt; And we're gonna get into the interface,\nif we're like,\n\n289\n00:15:17.145 --> 00:15:18.360\nwell what version do I have?\n\n290\n00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.000\nI'll show you where you can find that, and\nactually right here, what is your set up?\n\n291\n00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.370\nIf you want to have the full\nbenefits of this series to\n\n292\n00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:31.340\nMirror what you're looking at, you need a\nlocally installed version of Outlook 2016.\n\n293\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:36.793\nNow if you have Outlook 2013,\nyeah, it's probably gonna be.\n\n294\n00:15:36.793 --> 00:15:38.550\n&gt;&gt; Similar.\n&gt;&gt; Very, very similar.\n\n295\n00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:42.975\nThe differences between 13 and 69,\nI don't think they're a lot honestly.\n\n296\n00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:47.205\nSo, if you're on a lower version\nof 2013 you probably would\n\n297\n00:15:47.205 --> 00:15:49.025\nhave all the same features.\n\n298\n00:15:49.025 --> 00:15:51.795\nIf you go a little lower than that,\nI'm not sure about that one.\n\n299\n00:15:51.795 --> 00:15:56.186\nI can't guarantee anything, and if you\ndon't know what's going on, definitely\n\n300\n00:15:56.186 --> 00:16:00.217\ntalk to your IT department if you have\nan IT department that you can refer to.\n\n301\n00:16:00.217 --> 00:16:04.140\nIt really just depends on the size of\nyour company or your organization.\n\n302\n00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.751\nBut that's what we're gonna\nbe doing in this series, and\n\n303\n00:16:07.751 --> 00:16:11.374\nwe're going to go dive into Outlook and\ndo some emailing.\n\n304\n00:16:11.374 --> 00:16:14.310\nAnd we're gonna be doing some Calendars,\nwe're gonna do all sorts of fun stuff.\n\n305\n00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.670\n&gt;&gt; All right Von,\nit sounds like a great time for\n\n306\n00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:23.020\nus to think about the very fact of\nwhy it's gonna be important to us.\n\n307\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.990\nVon has just showed us what\nwe're actually doing, right?\n\n308\n00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:30.280\nWe're replacing older systems that\nare out there such as the day planner and\n\n309\n00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.130\nsome of the other things.\n\n310\n00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.620\nBut we're really focusing\nin on email a little bit,\n\n311\n00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:37.710\ncuz that's pretty much our experience is\nwhat we're seeing a lot of times here.\n\n312\n00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:41.320\nAnd then, we're gonna show you of\ncourse how to get in to all of that,\n\n313\n00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.730\nhow to customize it,\nhow to get it all set up.\n\n314\n00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:44.940\nSo make sure you stay tune for\n\n315\n00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.200\nthat if that's what your actually\nlooking to be able to do.\n\n316\n00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.080\nAll right, Vonne any last words for our\nviewers before we go and end this episode?\n\n317\n00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:55.800\n&gt;&gt; There was one note that I made in my\npresentation that I forgot to mention and\n\n318\n00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.450\nso I\n&gt;&gt; Throw that out there right now.\n\n319\n00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.040\nSo you talk about where Hotmail was and\nhas come from.\n\n320\n00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.570\nI also wanted to throw in Outlook Express.\n\n321\n00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:05.290\nDo you remember Outlook Express?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do.\n\n322\n00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's going back some time.\n\n323\n00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.050\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; I think Windows 7, maybe.\n\n324\n00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.420\n&gt;&gt; It may be earlier than that.\n\n325\n00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.660\nI don't think it appeared in Windows 7.\n\n326\n00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.180\nAnd even if- &gt; Is that one of those-\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember it being\n\n327\n00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:14.920\nthere any more.\n\n328\n00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.990\n&gt;&gt; Okay, just in case, we're talking about\na little bit of history and everything.\n\n329\n00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.470\nOutlook Express was something that came\n\n330\n00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:25.100\nwith your installing of your operation\nsystem, so they went ahead and put that.\n\n331\n00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:30.015\nAnd it was like an Outlook Lite if you\nwanna say, so it was able to go ahead and\n\n332\n00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:33.684\ndo all the things that you\ncould do through Outlook, but\n\n333\n00:17:33.684 --> 00:17:35.578\nin a much smaller capacity.\n\n334\n00:17:35.578 --> 00:17:39.640\nSo it was at the baby Outlook and\nit came with your operating system.\n\n335\n00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.920\nAnd I remember back in the day\nwhen we would teach Outlook,\n\n336\n00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:47.820\nyou'd always have to explain no\nOutlook Express is not he same as Outlook.\n\n337\n00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.710\nBut it's on my machine it's right there.\n\n338\n00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:52.820\nIt's not the same thing.\n\n339\n00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:56.120\nSo, I just wanted to put it out there\ntaking a trip down memory lane.\n\n340\n00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:56.940\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n341\n00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.210\n&gt;&gt; And if you look in\n&gt;&gt; She\n\n342\n00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.110\nsaid something about Outlook Express,\nbut she didn't cover it.\n\n343\n00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:01.720\nSo, now I've covered it.\n\n344\n00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.000\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, thank you again for\n\n345\n00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.010\neven that last little tidbit of\ninformation on Outlook Express.\n\n346\n00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:09.590\nA trip down memory lane no doubt in that.\n\n347\n00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.620\nBut remember that what we're\nactually gonna be doing here in\n\n348\n00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.660\nOutlook is to make sure that you get\neverything that you actually need if\n\n349\n00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.570\nyou're wanting to learn\nmore about Outlook.\n\n350\n00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:20.180\nSo make sure you watch all\nthe episodes that are right here with\n\n351\n00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.890\nVonne Smith, as well.\n\n352\n00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:23.850\nThat's a great place for us to sign off.\n\n353\n00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.860\nFor Office ProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n354\n00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:27.840\n&gt;&gt;

Well,\nwe're gonna start from the very beginning.\n\n27\n00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.162\nSo I have a PowerPoint presentation and\nwe are not doing PowerPoint,\n\n28\n00:01:17.162 --> 00:01:18.324\nwe're doing Outlook.\n\n29\n00:01:18.324 --> 00:01:20.590\n[LAUGH] I tried to say\nthat a couple of times.\n\n30\n00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.550\nSo let's just jump right\nin about Email Terminology.\n\n31\n00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.050\nSo let's start at the very,\n\n32\n00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.020\nvery beginning about server and clients,\ncuz you hear these terms all the time.\n\n33\n00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.656\nAnd so what is a server?\n\n34\n00:01:32.656 --> 00:01:36.363\nA server is just really a special\ncomputer, if you wanna say,\n\n35\n00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:38.440\nthat serves other computers.\n\n36\n00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.070\nAnd you, I would say,\nif you're sitting in an office and\n\n37\n00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.000\nyou are in a networked environment to\nwhere you have maybe a file server.\n\n38\n00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.940\nThere's email servers,\nthere's mail servers.\n\n39\n00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.720\nWell, I guess email and\nmail servers [LAUGH] are the same thing.\n\n40\n00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.985\nYou have different types of servers\nthat do different functionalities.\n\n41\n00:01:56.985 --> 00:02:02.460\nAnd so, if you're sitting at your desk,\nyou're at the client, you're at your own\n\n42\n00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.268\nmachine, that is connected to that server,\nand that they have a communications setup.\n\n43\n00:02:08.268 --> 00:02:13.490\nThat your computer can talk to the server\nand the server can talk to your computer.\n\n44\n00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.440\nAnd so, and I also think of servers,\n\n45\n00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.730\nit's almost like servers in a restaurant,\nright?\n\n46\n00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.850\nYou have some people that\nare just food runners, and\n\n47\n00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.560\nthen you have some people\nthat take your orders.\n\n48\n00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.729\nWhat were those,\nthe wine people called, with the fancy-\n\n49\n00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:30.376\n&gt;&gt; No, now you're talking way above me.\n\n50\n00:02:30.376 --> 00:02:32.922\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Talking about terminology,\n\n51\n00:02:32.922 --> 00:02:34.366\nI can't remember what that name is.\n\n52\n00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:38.345\nThe guy that's the wine guy and\nthey come around.\n\n53\n00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:39.142\n&gt;&gt; The guy in the beer truck.\n\n54\n00:02:39.142 --> 00:02:41.078\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n55\n00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:43.233\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The guy in\nthe beer truck works too, so.\n\n56\n00:02:43.233 --> 00:02:48.235\nBut they all have different reasons\nof why they serve the clients.\n\n57\n00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:49.986\nAnd clients are people in the restaurant.\n\n58\n00:02:49.986 --> 00:02:54.575\nSo that's always what I kinda think of and\nthat your server coordinates between\n\n59\n00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:58.765\nthe cooks in the back that get your\nfood to you, and then brings it to you.\n\n60\n00:02:58.765 --> 00:03:00.605\nYou don't talk directly to the cooks.\n\n61\n00:03:00.605 --> 00:03:03.515\nYou talk to the server, and\nthen the server talks to other people.\n\n62\n00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:08.163\nAnd so that's what I kind of equate\nthe whole server, client relationship.\n\n63\n00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:08.985\n&gt;&gt; And now, Vonne,\n\n64\n00:03:08.985 --> 00:03:13.975\nif I can kind of add in just a little\nbit to try and I hope to help out here.\n\n65\n00:03:13.975 --> 00:03:16.660\nMost of the time when you hear this right?\n\n66\n00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.840\nIt sounds confusing because the people\nthat talk about it understand what's going\n\n67\n00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.350\non, and you may be looking at it like,\nI don't have a clue.\n\n68\n00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.910\nI really don't have a clue\nwhat's going on here.\n\n69\n00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.664\nBut let's try to distinguish this\na little bit even simpler than that.\n\n70\n00:03:29.664 --> 00:03:32.913\nA server is a computer that you and\nI, as humans,\n\n71\n00:03:32.913 --> 00:03:37.180\nwe don't have to interact with\nit to make it do its job.\n\n72\n00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.360\nWhen we talk about a server, it's going\nto do its job once it's turned on.\n\n73\n00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.960\nThe client,\n\n74\n00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.550\nthough, is when you sit down at a computer\nand you have to interact with it.\n\n75\n00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.630\nSo, whether we're talking about\nthe software that's on it, or\n\n76\n00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.150\nwhether we're talking about\nthe physical machine,\n\n77\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.287\nwhen I set up an actual server itself,\nI'm installing software.\n\n78\n00:03:55.287 --> 00:04:00.272\nAnd once I install it and I configure\nit the way that it needs to work,\n\n79\n00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:04.880\nI can just wash my hands of it and\nsay, you do your job.\n\n80\n00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.620\nI don't ever have to touch it\nagain unless something goes wrong.\n\n81\n00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; But overall,\nthough, I really don't.\n\n82\n00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.780\nBut in what we're gonna\nbe taking a look at,\n\n83\n00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.600\nespecially with Outlook,\nOutlook is considered a client itself.\n\n84\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.750\nWhich means that somebody\nhas to interact with it.\n\n85\n00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.410\nIt's not just going to go and get email.\n\n86\n00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.560\nIt's not just gonna go and\ndo the things that it needs to do.\n\n87\n00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.750\nSomebody has to say, yes,\nget that, do this, run this.\n\n88\n00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.150\nMake sure that this actually happens here.\n\n89\n00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.394\nSo that's what you're normally doing\nwhen you're sitting at your computer and\n\n90\n00:04:36.394 --> 00:04:37.926\nyou're getting emails that come in.\n\n91\n00:04:37.926 --> 00:04:42.227\nOr when you're sending, the software\non your computer is not gonna go,\n\n92\n00:04:42.227 --> 00:04:46.180\nI think I'm just gonna\nsend Vonne Smith an email.\n\n93\n00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.670\nIt's me that says,\nI need to send Vonne an email.\n\n94\n00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.510\nAnd I go and I interact with\nthat software on that machine.\n\n95\n00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.730\nAnd then that says, all right,\nI'm gonna send this email.\n\n96\n00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.165\nBut when you do,\nit's gonna send it to the server.\n\n97\n00:04:58.165 --> 00:04:59.585\nThe server's gonna say,\n\n98\n00:04:59.585 --> 00:05:03.780\nI'll take care of giving it to Vonne,\nyou stay out of this process, Ronnie.\n\n99\n00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.520\nI know the job that I'm doing.\n\n100\n00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.554\nSo that's kind of the easiest and\nbasic way.\n\n101\n00:05:08.554 --> 00:05:11.409\nAnd that's why your server\nanalogy at the restaurant works.\n\n102\n00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:14.095\nWe're not really paying for the waiter.\n\n103\n00:05:14.095 --> 00:05:15.287\nI know it seems strange, right?\n\n104\n00:05:15.287 --> 00:05:17.397\nWe're really paying to get the food.\n\n105\n00:05:17.397 --> 00:05:20.260\nWe're really paying for\nthe end result that what we want.\n\n106\n00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.300\nThe servers really help us to do that,\nto get the end result.\n\n107\n00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.908\nAnd even though we might interact\nwith a waiter a lot of times,\n\n108\n00:05:26.908 --> 00:05:30.118\nif the waiter wasn't there, we'd\nprobably still go to that restaurant and\n\n109\n00:05:30.118 --> 00:05:31.338\neat when it comes down to it.\n\n110\n00:05:31.338 --> 00:05:32.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n111\n00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.080\nthat's what server really helps us do.\n\n112\n00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.425\nI hope that kind of clarifies\nit a little bit more.\n\n113\n00:05:36.425 --> 00:05:37.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n114\n00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.550\nthat's a great description of it because\nI think it's something that's basic.\n\n115\n00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.540\nAnd it's so basic, but yet\nif you don't understand,\n\n116\n00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.370\nthen your IT people are throwing all these\nterms and you're just like, wait, what?\n\n117\n00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.335\nYeah, just like you're talking about, so\n\n118\n00:05:52.335 --> 00:05:55.056\nI really like that you're saying you\nas a client, you have to do something.\n\n119\n00:05:55.056 --> 00:05:59.566\nBut the server,\nit does normally work until it goes down.\n\n120\n00:05:59.566 --> 00:06:02.361\nYou hear, the servers are down and\nthat's when the IT people come in and\n\n121\n00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:03.288\nthey go ahead and fix it.\n\n122\n00:06:03.288 --> 00:06:07.120\nAnd they do break, but for\nthe most part, they're set to run.\n\n123\n00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's the key, right?\n\n124\n00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.660\nIs that we really don't have to have a lot\nof interaction to make it do its job.\n\n125\n00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.310\nIt says, turn me on watch,\n\n126\n00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.140\nwhat I'll do and you just configure\nme to operate the way that needs to.\n\n127\n00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.656\nIf a glitch happens, come in and fix me.\n\n128\n00:06:20.656 --> 00:06:22.897\nBut besides that, let me do the job.\n\n129\n00:06:22.897 --> 00:06:25.125\nAnd so nobody's actually there.\n\n130\n00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:29.144\nThere's not a guy sitting there at that\nserver saying ,this goes to Vonne Smith,\n\n131\n00:06:29.144 --> 00:06:30.726\nthis email goes to Ronnie Wong.\n\n132\n00:06:30.726 --> 00:06:35.142\nCuz we pay that guy a ton of money as much\nemails are being moved around to do all\n\n133\n00:06:35.142 --> 00:06:36.965\nthat stuff, there's no way.\n\n134\n00:06:36.965 --> 00:06:37.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That server,\n\n135\n00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.130\nwe turn it on and\nit looks at it at lightning fast speeds,\n\n136\n00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.860\nhandles it within microseconds\nif not milliseconds.\n\n137\n00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.060\nAnd it's doing a great job doing it.\n\n138\n00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.790\nThat's why we appreciate the setup\nthe way that we have it now.\n\n139\n00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.424\nBecause it really does help to\nmake things much more efficient.\n\n140\n00:06:53.424 --> 00:06:57.062\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and we appreciate all those IT\nguys for setting it up, like Ronnie.\n\n141\n00:06:57.062 --> 00:06:59.663\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I break it more often than I set it up.\n\n142\n00:06:59.663 --> 00:07:01.615\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Come on,\n\n143\n00:07:01.615 --> 00:07:03.299\ngive yourself more credit than that, so.\n\n144\n00:07:03.299 --> 00:07:04.506\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n145\n00:07:04.506 --> 00:07:07.687\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n146\n00:07:07.687 --> 00:07:08.358\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n147\n00:07:08.358 --> 00:07:12.657\nso talking about more terminology,\nnow we've set up that we're client and\n\n148\n00:07:12.657 --> 00:07:13.933\nOutlook is a client and\n\n149\n00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:18.740\nthat it goes to some type of server that\nhandles all of our mail and everything.\n\n150\n00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.920\nSo then there's some other terminology\nthat we're going to encounter.\n\n151\n00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.585\nWe're talking about email in general,\nand this is not just for Outlook.\n\n152\n00:07:25.585 --> 00:07:27.732\nThis for just any email.\n\n153\n00:07:27.732 --> 00:07:32.096\nSo you have POP, IMAP,\nExchange, and SMTP, all right?\n\n154\n00:07:32.096 --> 00:07:32.763\nSo what do these all mean?\n\n155\n00:07:32.763 --> 00:07:38.697\nSo you could see that POP,\nthat stands for Post Office Protocol.\n\n156\n00:07:38.697 --> 00:07:41.203\nAnd 3 is just because there was\nmultiple versions of it and\n\n157\n00:07:41.203 --> 00:07:44.644\n3 is the last version that kinda stuck and\nthey haven't really gone past that.\n\n158\n00:07:44.644 --> 00:07:49.534\nI think there is something that POP4,\nbut it never really came into fruition.\n\n159\n00:07:49.534 --> 00:07:53.275\nSo POP3 it's like, it's working, it works\ngreat, so why don't we just keep that?\n\n160\n00:07:53.275 --> 00:07:56.982\nWell, then there's also IMAP,\nan Internet Message Access Protocol And\n\n161\n00:07:56.982 --> 00:08:01.229\nthen there's Exchange, Microsoft Exchange\nServer, which we've kind of already\n\n162\n00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:05.750\nmentioned in some of our other episodes,\nsince we are using a Microsoft product.\n\n163\n00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.430\nAnd then there's SMTP,\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol.\n\n164\n00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:14.865\nAll right, so what is a protocol?\n\n165\n00:08:14.865 --> 00:08:16.795\nAnd I'm actually,\nI'm using my notes over here.\n\n166\n00:08:16.795 --> 00:08:18.215\nAnd these are all in the show notes,\n\n167\n00:08:18.215 --> 00:08:23.173\nthat gives you address, or links to\nthe addresses you can find on Wikipedia.\n\n168\n00:08:23.173 --> 00:08:26.302\nSo a protocol is a system of rules and\ntelecommunications that allow two or\n\n169\n00:08:26.302 --> 00:08:29.852\nmore entities of communication\nsystems to transmit information via\n\n170\n00:08:29.852 --> 00:08:32.597\nany kind of variation\nof a physical quantity.\n\n171\n00:08:32.597 --> 00:08:33.777\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, that's a mouthful.\n\n172\n00:08:33.777 --> 00:08:37.202\n[LAUGH] It's really just how\ntwo things talk to each other,\n\n173\n00:08:37.202 --> 00:08:38.522\nthat's really all it is, okay?\n\n174\n00:08:38.522 --> 00:08:41.092\nAnd there's lots fo different\nprotocols that you can see right here,\n\n175\n00:08:41.092 --> 00:08:46.510\nthere's a POP, or post office protocol\nInternet Message Access Protocol.\n\n176\n00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.810\nIt's just different ways that we\ntalk to people or talk to things.\n\n177\n00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.020\nIt's almost like languages.\n\n178\n00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.730\nIf we're talking in English versus\nSpanish, we're still communicating.\n\n179\n00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.605\nIt just depends on which version if you\nwanna say, or what language we've both\n\n180\n00:08:58.605 --> 00:09:01.849\ndecided on, that that's how we're\ngoing to talk to each other.\n\n181\n00:09:01.849 --> 00:09:03.121\nThat's really what a protocol is.\n\n182\n00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:07.300\n&gt;&gt; And that's a great, very simplified\ndescription of what a protocol is.\n\n183\n00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.960\nIt is agreeing, those two machines that\nmay speak a different language, but\n\n184\n00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.110\nthey agree on a protocol\nthat they're gonna use.\n\n185\n00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:17.190\nThis diagram, or the slide that\nVonne actually puts up here,\n\n186\n00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:21.855\nreally does help us out, because it\nshows us some that computers can't do.\n\n187\n00:09:21.855 --> 00:09:24.250\nVonne and I,\neven if we were total strangers,\n\n188\n00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:28.550\nwe could set up an entire communication\nprocess just by walking the room and\n\n189\n00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.250\nintroducing ourselves to each other.\n\n190\n00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.940\nBut from that point we're\nalready communicating, and\n\n191\n00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.150\nthat's because we're both listening as\nwell as being able to send messages to\n\n192\n00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:42.690\neach other because we can talk and we\ncan actually hear almost simultaneously.\n\n193\n00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:46.945\nComputers need to be told how to do that,\nand the problem is it's not like us where\n\n194\n00:09:46.945 --> 00:09:50.024\nwe're learning and\nwe can understand that after a while.\n\n195\n00:09:50.024 --> 00:09:54.850\nFor example that SMTP down there Vonne,\nthat is used for sending messages.\n\n196\n00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.780\nIf I want to send a message, or-\n&gt;&gt; Like this.\n\n197\n00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go, yeah.\n\n198\n00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.120\nIf I want to do that,\nthen I have to use that protocol.\n\n199\n00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.180\nBut receiving messages,\nthey have to be different,\n\n200\n00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.530\nso that's what we're doing here, is we're\nactually showing that particular process.\n\n201\n00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:11.030\nIs that hey, here's how it has to work,\n\n202\n00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.412\nand if you have different systems\nthat are all over the world.\n\n203\n00:10:14.412 --> 00:10:16.380\nThey've gotta be able to\nuse that same language, and\n\n204\n00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.210\nthat's why these protocols\nare very important.\n\n205\n00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.840\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, like you just said that these\nprotocols of where there is two way\n\n206\n00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:28.380\ncommunication, but the way it goes out is\nusing that simple mail transfer protocol.\n\n207\n00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.699\nSo your outgoing has to go to the SMTP.\n\n208\n00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:34.981\nAnd then you also hear,\nmaybe we'll probably talk a little bit of,\n\n209\n00:10:34.981 --> 00:10:38.380\nmaybe even in the next episode about\nports, and the different ports,\n\n210\n00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.780\nI think they are listening.\n\n211\n00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.360\nI love the terminology, as you were\nalready saying, the listening, and\n\n212\n00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.890\nthe talking, and the speaking, and\n\n213\n00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:48.580\nhow computers actually,\nthey have to be configured to do that.\n\n214\n00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.080\nNow, a lot of this, it's already\npre-done and it's like all right.\n\n215\n00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.869\nSo I think SMTP was a 443.\n\n216\n00:10:54.869 --> 00:10:56.151\n&gt;&gt; Port 25.\n\n217\n00:10:56.151 --> 00:10:58.616\n&gt;&gt; 25,\nwell 443 was something though wasn't it?\n\n218\n00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:01.044\n&gt;&gt; HTTPS [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay see, [LAUGH] it's a little bit\n\n219\n00:11:01.044 --> 00:11:03.076\nof my Net+ coming out there [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There you go\n\n220\n00:11:03.076 --> 00:11:04.110\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Very limited.\n\n221\n00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:08.870\nBut there are certain ports that these\nparticular protocols are already mapped\n\n222\n00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.300\nto within the big old matrix\nof what a computer is,\n\n223\n00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.320\nif you wanna say for\nlack of a better terminology there.\n\n224\n00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.614\nBut yes, SMTP is for\nyou outgoing and how it comes in,\n\n225\n00:11:19.614 --> 00:11:24.781\nhow your mail comes to you, and\non your client from your server.\n\n226\n00:11:24.781 --> 00:11:27.490\nIt's either going to be in POP or IMAP.\n\n227\n00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.560\nAnd it's really just same but\ndifferent, my favorite term.\n\n228\n00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.670\nBut it's just different ways\nof how it needs to come in.\n\n229\n00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.420\nSo let's go ahead and\nexplain a little bit more.\n\n230\n00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.350\nNow I've already said about\nemail clients right here.\n\n231\n00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:43.660\nSo if you're going to be getting\nyour email through Outlook,\n\n232\n00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:48.450\nwhich this show is based on, then you\naren't going to be using that as a client.\n\n233\n00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:53.374\nSo you're going to have to tell your\ncomputer how to configure how it's going\n\n234\n00:11:53.374 --> 00:11:56.645\nto list them up how your\nemails are coming in to you.\n\n235\n00:11:56.645 --> 00:11:58.055\nBut if you're doing a webmail,\n\n236\n00:11:58.055 --> 00:12:01.031\nlike if you're going to Outlook.com,\nor you're going to Gmail,\n\n237\n00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:04.659\nyour Yahoo, you're going to your browser,\nyou're logging into your account.\n\n238\n00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.936\nThen you don't need to know anything\nreally about the protocols,\n\n239\n00:12:08.936 --> 00:12:11.343\nbecause it's almost like\nyou're at the source.\n\n240\n00:12:11.343 --> 00:12:15.484\nYou don't have to worry about how that's\ngoing to be coming into your device.\n\n241\n00:12:15.484 --> 00:12:18.090\nAnd we're not just talking\nabout your computer,\n\n242\n00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.270\nyou get this a lot on your phones, right?\n\n243\n00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:24.210\nTo set up your email on your phone,\nyou have to sometimes designate,\n\n244\n00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.900\nis this a POP account,\nis this an IMAP account?\n\n245\n00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.587\nFor example, and this could be in Outlook,\nthis could also be,\n\n246\n00:12:30.587 --> 00:12:35.165\ncuz IA is Cox Communications, because\nthat's a cable company around here, so\n\n247\n00:12:35.165 --> 00:12:37.830\nI use that, and\nI have a Cox email address.\n\n248\n00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.480\nSo if I was going to be setting up my\nphone to get that, there are some times on\n\n249\n00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.960\nyour phone that you have to set\nwhat is the IMAP if I'm using IMAP.\n\n250\n00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.736\nAnd all the your companies,\nthey either have IMAP or POP.\n\n251\n00:12:49.736 --> 00:12:51.781\nMost of the times they have both.\n\n252\n00:12:51.781 --> 00:12:53.376\nSometimes they might have one or\nthe other,\n\n253\n00:12:53.376 --> 00:12:56.305\nbecause that's just the way they're set\nup, but a lot of times they offer both,\n\n254\n00:12:56.305 --> 00:13:00.290\nso okay, I'm gonna set up IMAP, and we'll\nexplain in a little bit what that means.\n\n255\n00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:04.000\nSo you have to tell it what is\nthe address for your incoming, and\n\n256\n00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.950\nthen what is your address for\nyour outcoming.\n\n257\n00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:07.181\nYou can find that.\n\n258\n00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:12.004\nIf you go to Cox Communication and\nyou type in email settings,\n\n259\n00:13:12.004 --> 00:13:16.198\nthey'll give you,\nit'll be like smtp.cox.net.\n\n260\n00:13:16.198 --> 00:13:18.887\nOr and then it's like imap.cox.net.\n\n261\n00:13:18.887 --> 00:13:21.785\nI don't know if those\nare the actual addresses.\n\n262\n00:13:21.785 --> 00:13:23.865\nBut it's something along those lines.\n\n263\n00:13:23.865 --> 00:13:28.335\nAnd so whatever place you\nhave an email set up through,\n\n264\n00:13:28.335 --> 00:13:32.325\nwhether maybe it's like GoDaddy or\nany type of things like that.\n\n265\n00:13:32.325 --> 00:13:33.635\nThose are things I just remember\n\n266\n00:13:33.635 --> 00:13:35.880\nthroughout my life that\nI've had to set up.\n\n267\n00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.270\nThen you have to configure your device\non how that's all going to be set up,\n\n268\n00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.070\ncomputer, phone, tablet.\n\n269\n00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.920\nSo that would be an email client\nsetting up how your mail gets through.\n\n270\n00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.240\nBut like I said webmail,\n\n271\n00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.170\nyou're going to source, you don't\nneed to worry about those things.\n\n272\n00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.790\nSo let's take a look a little\nbit more in depth about POP.\n\n273\n00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.379\nOkay, so POP, wow!\n\n274\n00:13:56.379 --> 00:13:57.204\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Post office.\n\n275\n00:13:57.204 --> 00:13:58.246\n&gt;&gt; Post Office Protocol.\n\n276\n00:13:58.246 --> 00:14:03.012\n[LAUGH] So that is an application-layer\nInternet standard protocol used by local\n\n277\n00:14:03.012 --> 00:14:07.804\nemail clients to retrieve email from\na remote server over a TCP-IP connection.\n\n278\n00:14:07.804 --> 00:14:09.785\nAgain,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n279\n00:14:09.785 --> 00:14:10.979\n&gt;&gt; I'm reading this directly from\n\n280\n00:14:10.979 --> 00:14:13.856\nWikipedia and you've already like I'm\ngone, just tell me what this means.\n\n281\n00:14:13.856 --> 00:14:17.880\nAll right, but I wanted to give you\na little bit of backend on that TCP-ICP.\n\n282\n00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.510\nT-C-P-I-P, I already used\nsome more letters didn't I.\n\n283\n00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:28.270\nSo that is transmission control protocol,\nand the internet protocol.\n\n284\n00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:32.840\nSo it's really, again, just how your\ncomputer sets up how to listen.\n\n285\n00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.010\nIt's listen and talk, basically.\n\n286\n00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.550\nOkay so the TCP is a layer in\nyour application, the OSI,\n\n287\n00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:43.010\nagain I'm digressing a little bit,\nbut it's just all about computers and\n\n288\n00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:46.500\nhow they work, and just say,\nall right that's great, thanks Vonne.\n\n289\n00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.735\nHand wave, let's keep on going.\n\n290\n00:14:47.735 --> 00:14:51.420\n[LAUGH] So POP,\nthis is where you establish connections.\n\n291\n00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:55.885\nIt's almost like a bridge, okay, so\nthere's a bridge between your server,\n\n292\n00:14:55.885 --> 00:15:00.352\nthat's the thing on the left, and\nthen your client, that's your computer or\n\n293\n00:15:00.352 --> 00:15:01.910\nyour phone.\n\n294\n00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.454\nAnd so you set this up, and it's more\nof a one way communication system\n\n295\n00:15:06.454 --> 00:15:09.303\nin the sense that when\nyou set up your phone or\n\n296\n00:15:09.303 --> 00:15:12.316\ncomputer to receive your\nmessages using POP.\n\n297\n00:15:12.316 --> 00:15:15.181\nThen it says all right,\nwell here's everything on the server,\n\n298\n00:15:15.181 --> 00:15:17.780\nlet me go ahead and\nput everything down to your client, and\n\n299\n00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.130\nthen I'm gonna stop talking to you in\na sense, like the bridge is closed.\n\n300\n00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:25.330\nThe bridge only goes from the server to\nthe client, and then you can do whatever\n\n301\n00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.230\nyou want on your client phone,\ncomputer, whatever you wanna say.\n\n302\n00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:32.630\nAnd then, I can go ahead and say,\nmove messages, delete messages,\n\n303\n00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.110\nbut everything stays up on\nthe server as my server.\n\n304\n00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:39.150\nBut my client,\nI just get what I wanna do with it.\n\n305\n00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:44.318\nSo in the demonstration here, well what if\non my phone or computer I went ahead and\n\n306\n00:15:44.318 --> 00:15:49.039\ndeleted one of my emails in Outlook here,\ncuz I don't need that anymore.\n\n307\n00:15:49.039 --> 00:15:52.197\nWell then it's deleted on the client,\nand the client only.\n\n308\n00:15:52.197 --> 00:15:55.109\nIt still stays up on that server.\n\n309\n00:15:55.109 --> 00:15:58.277\nIn that kind of depository,\nif you want to say, in your account.\n\n310\n00:15:58.277 --> 00:16:01.236\nIt's still going to stay there,\ncuz remember that bridge,\n\n311\n00:16:01.236 --> 00:16:05.082\nthe information went over the bridge,\nand then it's like, now it's yours.\n\n312\n00:16:05.082 --> 00:16:09.139\nWe're gonna keep a copy of everything over\nhere, but what you do on your side of\n\n313\n00:16:09.139 --> 00:16:12.651\nthe bridge doesn't bother us,\nyou do whatever you want with this.\n\n314\n00:16:12.651 --> 00:16:17.953\nCuz it doesn't really necessarily talk\nback, in a sense, to your server.\n\n315\n00:16:17.953 --> 00:16:20.990\nNow remember, you're like well wait\na second, then how am I sending emails?\n\n316\n00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:22.440\nRemember it's two different protocols,\n\n317\n00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.860\nwe're only talking about\nincoming messages.\n\n318\n00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.379\nHow you send messages out,\nthat goes out through SMTP, so\n\n319\n00:16:26.379 --> 00:16:27.526\nthat's something completely different.\n\n320\n00:16:27.526 --> 00:16:31.798\nIt still goes through your server,\nbut it's outgoing,\n\n321\n00:16:31.798 --> 00:16:37.620\nnot incoming, so that's what we have\ngoing on with our POP protocol.\n\n322\n00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.276\nAnd IMAP, IMAP is a little different,\n\n323\n00:16:40.276 --> 00:16:45.118\nIMAP is an Internet standard to\nretrieve email messages using TCP ICP.\n\n324\n00:16:45.118 --> 00:16:50.408\nBut it will allow you to use\nmultiple devices, in a sense that\n\n325\n00:16:50.408 --> 00:16:56.660\nI could have my computer set up with\nmy email coming down on my Outlook.\n\n326\n00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.561\nI can have my Outlook on\nmy phone go ahead and\n\n327\n00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:02.877\nbringing in my messages using IMAP or\nwhatever.\n\n328\n00:17:02.877 --> 00:17:06.200\nAnd it doesn't necessarily\nneed to be my Office 365,\n\n329\n00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.980\nthis could be my cox.net account,\nall right.\n\n330\n00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.552\nSo if I had it set up here,\nthe way this means is like,\n\n331\n00:17:11.552 --> 00:17:13.084\nit is a two way communication.\n\n332\n00:17:13.084 --> 00:17:16.164\nIn a sense that whatever's on your server,\nand\n\n333\n00:17:16.164 --> 00:17:20.870\nwhatever's on your client,\nit's mirroring, it talks to each other.\n\n334\n00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:24.965\nSo for\nexample if I go ahead on my computer,\n\n335\n00:17:24.965 --> 00:17:28.345\nI delete a couple emails,\nwell it's going to.\n\n336\n00:17:28.345 --> 00:17:31.115\nI forgot to delete these over here\non my slide, whoops [LAUGH] here,\n\n337\n00:17:31.115 --> 00:17:35.775\nthose are supposed to be gone, all right,\nso I forgot here, let's do this.\n\n338\n00:17:35.775 --> 00:17:36.993\nWhoop, bad slide, bad slide.\n\n339\n00:17:36.993 --> 00:17:41.345\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go, now let's go ahead and\n\n340\n00:17:41.345 --> 00:17:44.730\nrun that slideshow from where we were,\nnothing to see here.\n\n341\n00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:45.977\nNow we're ready [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n342\n00:17:45.977 --> 00:17:48.634\n&gt;&gt; So you could see that if I delete it on\n\n343\n00:17:48.634 --> 00:17:52.885\nmy computer, and\nthen that means that it will delete it on\n\n344\n00:17:52.885 --> 00:17:56.100\nthe server where all your mail is located.\n\n345\n00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.149\nAnd then it will sync over to your device,\n\n346\n00:17:58.149 --> 00:18:01.372\nthat's on your phone, and so\nit's all one, if you wanna say, so\n\n347\n00:18:01.372 --> 00:18:04.614\nit's almost like multiple remote controls,\nif you want to say.\n\n348\n00:18:04.614 --> 00:18:06.967\nIf I delete it on my phone,\nit's deleted on my computer,\n\n349\n00:18:06.967 --> 00:18:09.370\nif I delete it on my computer,\nit's deleted on my phone.\n\n350\n00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:14.270\nBecause it's really talking to each other\nthrough your server and your client,\n\n351\n00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.770\nand that's what IMAP does.\n\n352\n00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:17.489\nNow, which way is better?\n\n353\n00:18:17.489 --> 00:18:22.145\nIt really just depends on your flavor of\nthings, I mean there's goods and bads for\n\n354\n00:18:22.145 --> 00:18:23.640\nall of this kind of stuff.\n\n355\n00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.500\nSo it really just depends on how\nyou want your mail configured.\n\n356\n00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.730\nI don't ever wanna delete\nanything on the server side,\n\n357\n00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.630\nthen you might wanna go ahead and use POP.\n\n358\n00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:35.178\nIf you're like, no I want everything\nto look the same everywhere,\n\n359\n00:18:35.178 --> 00:18:36.798\nthen you might wanna go ahead and\nuse IMAP.\n\n360\n00:18:36.798 --> 00:18:39.986\nSo those are your different protocols for\nyour incoming messages.\n\n361\n00:18:39.986 --> 00:18:45.250\nNow we talked about Exchange,\nnow Exchange isn't really a protocol.\n\n362\n00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:49.060\nExchange is what Microsoft uses,\nwe've talked about for\n\n363\n00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:54.700\nsetting up your own mail servers, but\nit's a mail server and calendaring.\n\n364\n00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.680\nYes, that is a word.\n\n365\n00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.570\nServer developed by Microsoft, and\n\n366\n00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:02.600\nit runs exclusively on\nthe Windows Server operating systems.\n\n367\n00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:08.119\nIt uses a proprietary protocol\ncalled M-A-M-I, MAPI.\n\n368\n00:19:08.119 --> 00:19:08.828\n&gt;&gt; MAPI.\n\n369\n00:19:08.828 --> 00:19:12.296\n&gt;&gt; Or MAPI, [LAUGH] MAPI, MAPI,\nwhichever way you wanna say it, and\n\n370\n00:19:12.296 --> 00:19:13.695\nwhat does that stand for?\n\n371\n00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:17.814\nIt stands for Messaging\nApplication Programming Interface,\n\n372\n00:19:17.814 --> 00:19:22.176\nmessaging architecture and\ncomponent object model based [SOUND].\n\n373\n00:19:22.176 --> 00:19:27.160\nOkay yeah I'm already like what,\n[LAUGH] so remember POP and IMAP.\n\n374\n00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:32.270\nWell, Exchange uses MAPI,\nokay, but it is Windows-based,\n\n375\n00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:36.300\nlike I said,\nproprietary to Exchange servers.\n\n376\n00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.910\nSomething you also might hear about when\nyou're talking about Exchange servers,\n\n377\n00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:41.690\nif you're talking with your IT people.\n\n378\n00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.680\nIs they'll might throw out things like\nActive Directory, and ActiveSync,\n\n379\n00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.741\nis that what it's called?\n\n380\n00:19:45.741 --> 00:19:46.900\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n381\n00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:51.556\nyou have these different things that are\nvery Microsoft specific, it's almost like,\n\n382\n00:19:51.556 --> 00:19:57.640\nwhat do I call, like a closed-circuit TV,\nit's only within that one little area.\n\n383\n00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:02.646\nAnd that's why I kind of drew this\npicture right here, is that if you're\n\n384\n00:20:02.646 --> 00:20:08.248\nset up on an Exchange server, and your\nclient is talking to Microsoft Exchange.\n\n385\n00:20:08.248 --> 00:20:12.694\nAnd so everything that's on your computer,\nwhile Outlook still,\n\n386\n00:20:12.694 --> 00:20:14.800\nit is connected to that server.\n\n387\n00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.940\nAnd I put a little,\n\n388\n00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:19.400\nwe'll call this a trapezoid, around these\ncomputers that are all set up that way.\n\n389\n00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.580\nBecause within this kind\nof closed-circuit TV, or\n\n390\n00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.860\nthis like kind of closed system, you\nactually have some extended capabilities.\n\n391\n00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:30.610\nThat only people that\nyou are associated with,\n\n392\n00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:35.700\nwithin your Microsoft Exchange server,\nthat you can be able to take advantage of.\n\n393\n00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.480\nThings like later we'll see voting\nbuttons, and yeah, voting buttons, and\n\n394\n00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:43.080\nthings that you can put in your email,\nand maybe sending attachments.\n\n395\n00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.511\nI know I could be able to send a really\nlarge attachment to somebody else with\n\n396\n00:20:46.511 --> 00:20:49.235\nthe university because we were\nall on Exchange server, and\n\n397\n00:20:49.235 --> 00:20:50.939\nwe didn't have as many size limits.\n\n398\n00:20:50.939 --> 00:20:54.486\nBut if I was trying to send\nsomething somebody in Gmail,\n\n399\n00:20:54.486 --> 00:20:58.420\nGmail has different limitations\non their attachment sizes.\n\n400\n00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:03.182\nAnd so I could do certain things within my\nExchange environment, if you wanna say, or\n\n401\n00:21:03.182 --> 00:21:06.227\nmy ecosystem that I could\nwith other Exchange people,\n\n402\n00:21:06.227 --> 00:21:08.560\nthat I couldn't do with people outside.\n\n403\n00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.160\nSo that's why you have the trapezoid\nthat goes around people.\n\n404\n00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.340\nNow, I can still go ahead and\nemail people in Gmail or whatever, and\n\n405\n00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:21.200\nI could still go ahead and set up\nOutlook on my phone to connect to my\n\n406\n00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.290\nemail that is being administrated\nby an Exchange server.\n\n407\n00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:25.110\nOr I could go ahead and\n\n408\n00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:31.000\nsetup my computer at home to be able\nto connect to my Exchange server.\n\n409\n00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.330\nBut I'm not necessarily on-premise if you\nwanna say, I'm not in the trapezoid, but\n\n410\n00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:36.880\nI can still go ahead and connect.\n\n411\n00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.090\nSo again, that Exchange server goes ahead\nand manages everything that way, and so\n\n412\n00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:45.330\nthat's what we have Exchange, or\nMAPI as the protocol to use there.\n\n413\n00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.960\nAnd this is a slide,\nit really just goes ahead and\n\n414\n00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.531\nsummarizes everything of just giving the,\nnot analogies,\n\n415\n00:21:53.531 --> 00:21:58.170\nthe acronyms, what they actually mean,\nand just a little bit about it.\n\n416\n00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:01.340\nAnd that is I believe the end of\nmy slide presentation, yes it is.\n\n417\n00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.650\nSo hopefully this gives\nyou a little bit more\n\n418\n00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:08.020\nexplanation into all of these words that\npeople are gonna be throwing around,\n\n419\n00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.500\nespecially so you can start talking\nthe talk and walking the walk.\n\n420\n00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.889\nAs you get into Outlook, when we start\ntalking about setting up your email\n\n421\n00:22:14.889 --> 00:22:16.703\naccounts, you will see these things.\n\n422\n00:22:16.703 --> 00:22:20.893\nSo knowing what they are,\nI think, is, start place one,\n\n423\n00:22:20.893 --> 00:22:23.665\nstart place one, yeah, square one.\n\n424\n00:22:23.665 --> 00:22:26.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's where we're starting in right now,\n\n425\n00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.015\nthat's where we're ending, so.\n\n426\n00:22:27.015 --> 00:22:29.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, well thank you for\n\n427\n00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.960\nintroducing us to that\ndifferent terminology.\n\n428\n00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.327\nThat really is gonna give us at least\na basic understanding of what a server is,\n\n429\n00:22:35.327 --> 00:22:38.501\nand a client, and the different\ncommunication protocols between them.\n\n430\n00:22:38.501 --> 00:22:42.530\nThat we're normally taking a look at\nespecially when dealing with email.\n\n431\n00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:47.200\nWell there's more for us to come than\njust terminology, so let's go ahead and\n\n432\n00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.640\nget right to it, it's a great place for\nus to stop this episode and\n\n433\n00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.740\nthen to start another one as well.\n\n434\n00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.994\nSo signing off for Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n435\n00:22:55.994 --> 00:22:57.330\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n436\n00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:01.357\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Office 2016 shows.\n\n437\n00:23:01.357 -->

host\n\n3\n00:00:11.105 --> 00:00:15.451\nRonnie Wang and today we gonna be a look\nat setting up an email account and\n\n4\n00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:18.120\nhere to help us do that, Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n5\n00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.322\nVonne welcome back to the show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:20.090\n&gt;&gt; Hi Ronnie.\n\n7\n00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.864\nYes, hello everybody.\n\n8\n00:00:20.864 --> 00:00:23.165\nWe are going to setup email accounts,\njust like you said.\n\n9\n00:00:23.165 --> 00:00:27.040\n[LAUGH] So when we get Outlook on\nour computer, say we want to tour,\n\n10\n00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.549\nwe have an Office 365 account and\nwe went ahead and sign into our account,\n\n11\n00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:36.199\nwe download it or install Outlook and\nWord and PowerPoint and everything on our\n\n12\n00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.455\ncomputer, well then we turn on and look\non and then now what's suppose to happen?\n\n13\n00:00:41.455 --> 00:00:45.417\nWell, before you can actually start doing\nanything in Outlook, for the most part,\n\n14\n00:00:45.417 --> 00:00:49.237\nyou're gonna have to go ahead and\nset up your email in Outlook, to say,\n\n15\n00:00:49.237 --> 00:00:52.667\nall right, I'm going to use\nOutlook to manage my mail.\n\n16\n00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:55.693\nSo I need to set up how the messages\nare going to be coming in, and\n\n17\n00:00:55.693 --> 00:00:57.793\nthen the how they're\ngoing to be coming out.\n\n18\n00:00:57.793 --> 00:00:59.533\nAnd so how do you do that?\n\n19\n00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.163\nWell, I'm here to tell you.\n\n20\n00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:04.463\nSo I have a PowerPoint\npresentation that I went ahead and\n\n21\n00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:08.791\ndid some screenshots for\na fresh install Of Outlook.\n\n22\n00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:13.491\nSo I went ahead and did the same thing\nwhen I built my Virtual Machines because\n\n23\n00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:16.451\nI'm on a Mac here, but I went ahead and\nbuilt my Window machines and\n\n24\n00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:20.561\nI did the whole process and so\nI took some snapshots and screenshots as\n\n25\n00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:24.281\nI went through that so that way you\nguys could see the same exact thing.\n\n26\n00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:28.041\nBut before we get into that, I did want\nto go ahead and throw this web address\n\n27\n00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:32.590\nout there that's on this slide and I have\nit pulled up on my web browser as well\n\n28\n00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.440\nbecause it, the support in Microsoft,\nthey're actually really good.\n\n29\n00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.530\nTheir help files online\nare extremely helpful which is\n\n30\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.190\nyou know weird to say because I remember\nusing the help files back in the day.\n\n31\n00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.040\nMicrosoft Help Files are built in,\nthey weren't very helpful, so\n\n32\n00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.630\nkudos to Microsoft for\nreally vamping those up, and\n\n33\n00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.520\nyou can really just find a lot of\nthings here on your support.office.com.\n\n34\n00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.340\nReally just go to Microsoft and type in\nsupport and you'll be able to find it.\n\n35\n00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.010\nBut this is addressed right here,\ngetting started with Outlook, and\n\n36\n00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.880\nthis does apply to, as you can see,\nOutlook versions all the way down to 2007.\n\n37\n00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.750\nAnd talk about some basics and\naccessibility but\n\n38\n00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.080\nwe're going to talk specifically\nabout setting up your account.\n\n39\n00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.770\nYou can see there's pop in iMap that\nwe talked before Ronnie in our other\n\n40\n00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.620\nepisodes.\n\n41\n00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.460\nSo just knowing what that means\nis going to be important.\n\n42\n00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.970\nAnd if you don't know what it means\nit actually has some links in\n\n43\n00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.550\nhere that we'll go ahead and\nexplain it to you.\n\n44\n00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.290\nSo If those out there to show\nthat how do I set up my path or\n\n45\n00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.360\nImap setting for Outlook how do I add\nmy Outlook.com account in Outlook so\n\n46\n00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.740\nhow do I go ahead and\nget everything set up?\n\n47\n00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.739\nSo great reference here\ndefinitely check that out\n\n48\n00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.040\ngoing back over here to our\npower point presentation.\n\n49\n00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.790\nI have outlook already\ninstalled on my machine.\n\n50\n00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.300\nI’m going to go ahead and bring it up but\nyou can see its already setup.\n\n51\n00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:07.450\nMy email account has been connected to\nmy jt@officeprodemoco.micorosoft.com.\n\n52\n00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.790\nThis is already setup so\nhow did I get this?\n\n53\n00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.240\nLike I said, I installed the program,\nI tried to open it up, and\n\n54\n00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.850\nit said hey, welcome,\nhere let me show you.\n\n55\n00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.470\nIt says hey welcome to\n[LAUGH] Outlook 2016.\n\n56\n00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.140\nLet me help you go ahead and set up\nhow we can do your account together.\n\n57\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.790\nAnd I said great,\nthank you Outlook and so it said,\n\n58\n00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.750\nlet me zoom in on this a little bit here.\n\n59\n00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.230\nIt says are you going to be using\nOutlook to connect to Email?\n\n60\n00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.190\nThat's part, you have an account and\nyou have an IMAP.\n\n61\n00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.910\nAre you going to be using\nOutlook to connect?\n\n62\n00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.370\nYes.\nI do want that.\n\n63\n00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.500\nSo then the next step is going to be able,\nlet me go ahead.\n\n64\n00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.870\nAnd auto configure auto set\nup this account for you.\n\n65\n00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.890\nGo ahead and tell me what your name is and\nso I typed in my name Justin Timberlake\n\n66\n00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.990\nand then I went ahead and\nput in my email address and\n\n67\n00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.720\nthe password that I use to go ahead and\naccess my account.\n\n68\n00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.900\nAnd that is all I needed to do.\n\n69\n00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.820\nAnd then it just did all the work for me.\n\n70\n00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.770\nAnd it just said ok well let me\ngo ahead and search out there,\n\n71\n00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.750\nlet me establish network connections so\nyep I found them.\n\n72\n00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.140\nLet me go ahead and see about settings for\nthat particular count.\n\n73\n00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.950\nAnd it realized since it was\nan Office 365 it was like,\n\n74\n00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.685\nlet me go out there yep I found it,\n\n75\n00:04:19.685 --> 00:04:24.160\nokay, yeah perfect I got it and then\nI'm going to start logging into email.\n\n76\n00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.920\nAnd you basically just sit there and wait.\n\n77\n00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.150\nIt might take a while sometimes.\n\n78\n00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.310\nThis could take anywhere from 30\nseconds to maybe three or five minutes.\n\n79\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.420\nIt really depends on your connection, how\nlong it has to kind of go out there and\n\n80\n00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.120\nsearch for everything.\n\n81\n00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.800\nBut if it takes a while, that's okay.\n\n82\n00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.160\nNow if it takes 25 minutes.\n\n83\n00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.060\nOkay, now you might be like.\n\n84\n00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.500\nHe might just be like hey I'm looking and\nI don't see anything.\n\n85\n00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.710\nSo if it's an extended period of time.\n\n86\n00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.330\n&gt;&gt; Check for typos\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and\n\n87\n00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.990\na lot of times it will give you an error,\nlike I can't connect.\n\n88\n00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.830\nI don't understand.\n\n89\n00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.020\nSo everything that I have here,\n\n90\n00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.930\nit's showing all the successful\ninstallations and everything.\n\n91\n00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.640\nBut if there's something along\nthe way that's like I don't see it.\n\n92\n00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.340\nIt will tell you connection\ncannot be found or\n\n93\n00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.280\ncannot establish network connection.\n\n94\n00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.610\nWell maybe I'm not\nconnected to the internet.\n\n95\n00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.840\nSo those are different things.\n\n96\n00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.070\nSo check your cables and\nall that good stuff.\n\n97\n00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.030\nI threw in this slide\nright here because for\n\n98\n00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.110\nsome reason the way that our\naccounts are set up It gave me,\n\n99\n00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.860\ncuz I all ready typed in my email\naddress and I typed in my password.\n\n100\n00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.880\nBut then it came back and\nit was like, okay well I found it,\n\n101\n00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.010\nand you can see our little Office Pro demo\noccur well waiting for our demonstrations\n\n102\n00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.950\nthere that Ronnie went ahead and\nset up cuz he administrated this.\n\n103\n00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.710\nI created the logo, you did the setup.\n\n104\n00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.790\nAnd so I had to sign in again, I had\nto put my password in one more time so\n\n105\n00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.950\nit's like okay, let me go ahead and\nconnect your account.\n\n106\n00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.335\nSo, just in case you're on an Office\n365 account, you might see it again.\n\n107\n00:05:51.335 --> 00:05:52.415\nSo I just wanna have and through that.\n\n108\n00:05:52.415 --> 00:05:54.045\nIf you don't see it that's fine too.\n\n109\n00:05:54.045 --> 00:05:57.205\nAnd then you can see at the end\n\n110\n00:05:57.205 --> 00:06:02.315\non this slide it says all right well yap\nI wanna had and found here email address.\n\n111\n00:06:02.315 --> 00:06:06.935\nI got all the settings and I'm going to\ngo ahead and I've configured this and\n\n112\n00:06:06.935 --> 00:06:10.560\ntried to go ahead in years and I'm ready\nto go, and I think there's a couple more\n\n113\n00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.260\nslides after this, just because\nthis was a fresh installation.\n\n114\n00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.720\nOne thing, down here, let me zoom in\na little bit more so you can see that.\n\n115\n00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.235\nYou see how it says,\nSet up Outlook Mobile on my phone too.\n\n116\n00:06:22.235 --> 00:06:25.805\nI didn't want to scroll down too far\nthough because then it's gonna go\n\n117\n00:06:25.805 --> 00:06:26.585\nto the next slide.\n\n118\n00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:29.105\nBut that check box is down on\nthe bottom left-hand corner.\n\n119\n00:06:29.105 --> 00:06:30.405\nIf it's checked on,\n\n120\n00:06:30.405 --> 00:06:34.415\nit's gonna automatically send\nyou out to the website here.\n\n121\n00:06:34.415 --> 00:06:37.045\nAnd you can see it says, www.outlook.com.\n\n122\n00:06:37.045 --> 00:06:40.605\nAnd it's saying, here, go ahead and\nput in your phone number and\n\n123\n00:06:40.605 --> 00:06:41.705\nwe'll send you a link.\n\n124\n00:06:41.705 --> 00:06:45.220\nIt's basically a text message I think\nit's a text message for the most part.\n\n125\n00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.060\nAnd I'll go ahead and click on it, and\n\n126\n00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.010\nyou can go ahead and have it setup on\nyour phone to that kinda automatic setup.\n\n127\n00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.710\nOkay, well I didn't need to have\nit configured on my phone so\n\n128\n00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.010\nI just closed out of the web browser and\nsaid no, that's fine.\n\n129\n00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.750\nI didn't have it send me any information.\n\n130\n00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.950\nBut if you're wondering why this is coming\nup, it's because of that little check box.\n\n131\n00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.600\nAnd it's on by default.\n\n132\n00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.121\nSo if you don't want this step just\nuncheck it and then you can skip the step.\n\n133\n00:07:07.121 --> 00:07:10.962\nAnd then it says all right, well first\nthings first, remember this is a fresh\n\n134\n00:07:10.962 --> 00:07:15.100\ninstallation of Office on my computer so\nit's taking all the screenshots as it goes\n\n135\n00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.136\nit's like this is going to be\nset up with automatic updates.\n\n136\n00:07:18.136 --> 00:07:23.018\nFor the most part you wanna keep\nthe automatic update unless your company\n\n137\n00:07:23.018 --> 00:07:27.739\nis set up for some reason, whatever\nthe reason may be where they don't\n\n138\n00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:32.461\nwant to have updates automatically,\nit's really kind of, I guess,\n\n139\n00:07:32.461 --> 00:07:36.224\npersonal choice for a company,\nbut updates are good and\n\n140\n00:07:36.224 --> 00:07:41.140\nthat's why we have a subscription\nbased product such as Office 365.\n\n141\n00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.750\nTo say, hey, go ahead and give me\nthe updates and we'll do all those kind of\n\n142\n00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.850\nlike, maybe some new features, and\nof course there's always security issues.\n\n143\n00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:52.250\nOur security Patches and things of why\nyou'd want to have your updates to do\n\n144\n00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.270\nautomatically and\nyou're accepting the agreement there.\n\n145\n00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.517\nAnd then the next one it says,\nall right well then there you go, and\n\n146\n00:07:57.517 --> 00:07:58.171\nopens up Outlook.\n\n147\n00:07:58.171 --> 00:08:02.201\nWell actually I already had Outlook open,\nand so it says here let me go ahead and\n\n148\n00:08:02.201 --> 00:08:05.337\ngive you some new features, and\nit gives you a quick little.\n\n149\n00:08:05.337 --> 00:08:07.630\nOverview, and then you're set.\n\n150\n00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.260\nAnd then that's how I got to this.\n\n151\n00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.195\nAnd so this is my account, and\nI have everything set up, and\n\n152\n00:08:13.195 --> 00:08:14.388\nwe're all ready to go.\n\n153\n00:08:14.388 --> 00:08:17.040\nSo, that's where you can go to do that.\n\n154\n00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.180\nNow, let's just say that you have Outlook,\nand you already had it installed.\n\n155\n00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.040\nAnd you're like, okay, well,\n\n156\n00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.640\nit didn't give me a prompt to go ahead and\nset up anything.\n\n157\n00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.280\nI think it always does,\nif it doesn't detect an account.\n\n158\n00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.840\nSo I think it happens automatically,\nbut just in case, for whatever reason,\n\n159\n00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:39.180\nwhat if I needed to go find where I\ncould do that whole setup in Outlook?\n\n160\n00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.340\nNow we have a whole episode on\nexploring the Outlook interface, so\n\n161\n00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.280\nthat's coming up.\n\n162\n00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.480\nIf you're watching in succession,\nthat would be the next one.\n\n163\n00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.660\nBut for now, I'm just gonna show you,\ngo over to the File tab on the ribbon, and\n\n164\n00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.600\nthe File tab, it's technically\ncalled the backstage view,\n\n165\n00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.460\nand it takes you back to here.\n\n166\n00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.750\nAnd right here, you see Account Settings,\nand then if you drop that down,\n\n167\n00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.160\nyou can go into your account settings.\n\n168\n00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.954\nAnd you can add or remove accounts and\nchange existing connection settings.\n\n169\n00:09:04.954 --> 00:09:07.206\nAnd so maybe you have something set up,\n\n170\n00:09:07.206 --> 00:09:11.300\nand there has been a server change\n[LAUGH] or some type of thing that like,\n\n171\n00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.932\nwhatever you configured it and\nnow it has to go somewhere else.\n\n172\n00:09:14.932 --> 00:09:18.146\nOr maybe you have a different email, you\ndon't want this one to be there anymore,\n\n173\n00:09:18.146 --> 00:09:19.369\nand you wanna remove this one.\n\n174\n00:09:19.369 --> 00:09:24.829\nAnd then because remember, Outlook is\nreally just the referee, if you wanna say,\n\n175\n00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:30.490\nit's the intermediary between how you want\nto interact with you, with your email.\n\n176\n00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.750\nSo accounts can come and go in a sense,\nit's like I don't wanna go ahead and\n\n177\n00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.730\nuse Outlook to manage\nthis particular account.\n\n178\n00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.493\nBut I wanna go ahead and\nhave it manage my other account.\n\n179\n00:09:40.493 --> 00:09:44.763\nNow if you're in an office,\nyou probably only want Outlook to be\n\n180\n00:09:44.763 --> 00:09:49.439\nconfigured to do just your Office\naccounts, just your work account.\n\n181\n00:09:49.439 --> 00:09:51.879\nBut you could have it manage\nmultiple accounts, and\n\n182\n00:09:51.879 --> 00:09:54.380\nI'll show you an example of\nthat in just a little bit.\n\n183\n00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:58.520\nBut I did wanna go ahead and get you\ninto this Account Settings dialog box\n\n184\n00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.972\nbecause this is where you would\ngo to do all of those things.\n\n185\n00:10:01.972 --> 00:10:05.796\nAnd you can see right here in your\nemail accounts, in my email tab,\n\n186\n00:10:05.796 --> 00:10:09.340\nthis is where I would be able\nto set up a new connection.\n\n187\n00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.680\nOr if I wanted to take this one,\nI could remove this one and add others.\n\n188\n00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.748\nSo just to go ahead and\nclick here on the New button right here,\n\n189\n00:10:16.748 --> 00:10:20.555\nthat those screenshots I had taken\nin the PowerPoint, it's right here.\n\n190\n00:10:20.555 --> 00:10:24.200\nHere's my auto account set up, and\nthat's exactly what I could do,\n\n191\n00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.330\nI can go ahead and\ndo all the same steps right in here.\n\n192\n00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.480\nAll right, perfect, and this is\nthe same if you, now I'm giving you\n\n193\n00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:38.460\nthe demonstration on an Office 365\naccount, right, that's established.\n\n194\n00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.864\nBut it's the exact same thing for\na Gmail account,\n\n195\n00:10:41.864 --> 00:10:44.883\nbecause you could use it,\nsay, I use Gmail.\n\n196\n00:10:44.883 --> 00:10:50.805\nAnd I would like to go ahead and have\nOutlook configured to manage my Gmail.\n\n197\n00:10:50.805 --> 00:10:54.777\nThat seems almost kinda weird,\nbut it's totally legit.\n\n198\n00:10:54.777 --> 00:10:58.712\nAgain, it's just a client that you can\nuse to go ahead and use this to email.\n\n199\n00:10:58.712 --> 00:11:02.617\nInstead of you going online and logging\ninto Gmail, even though it's really easy,\n\n200\n00:11:02.617 --> 00:11:04.605\n[LAUGH] maybe you want that for\nsome reason.\n\n201\n00:11:04.605 --> 00:11:08.534\nSo I wanted to go ahead and show you\non this PowerPoint presentation that\n\n202\n00:11:08.534 --> 00:11:12.300\nthe Gmail setup,\nit was the exact same way, and I did this.\n\n203\n00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.810\nOkay, I went ahead and set up.\n\n204\n00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:19.020\nI have another account that I'm going to\nbe using in these shows along the way,\n\n205\n00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:23.310\nthat we might go over and jump into\nGmail with Chris, Chris Kirkpatrick.\n\n206\n00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:27.700\nAnd he has a Gmail account, and\nI went ahead and set up his username and\n\n207\n00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.850\npassword, or the email and his password.\n\n208\n00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.423\nAnd did the exact same steps,\nthey went through and went out and\n\n209\n00:11:33.423 --> 00:11:35.252\nestablished that connection.\n\n210\n00:11:35.252 --> 00:11:39.663\nAnd it searched for the settings,\nand then when it was done,\n\n211\n00:11:39.663 --> 00:11:41.663\nit said, I'm ready to go.\n\n212\n00:11:41.663 --> 00:11:44.678\nI just typed in my email address, typed\nin my password, and it did everything.\n\n213\n00:11:44.678 --> 00:11:50.220\nAnd notice it said your IMAP email\naccount is successfully configured.\n\n214\n00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.860\nBack to that episode we just finished\nwatching, hopefully if you're watching in\n\n215\n00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:58.390\norder, we talked about the IMAP, and\nthe POP3, and the SMTP, and all those\n\n216\n00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:04.900\ndifferent terminology that is associated\nwith using email on your computer.\n\n217\n00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.729\nSo Gmail, auto setup, but\n\n218\n00:12:07.729 --> 00:12:13.391\nlet's just say maybe your\nauto setup isn't working.\n\n219\n00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:15.530\nIt's saying nope, I can't connect.\n\n220\n00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.620\nAnd I've had this happen to me\nbefore I think even when I,\n\n221\n00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:22.530\nI don't know,\nmaybe when I was at the university.\n\n222\n00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:27.360\nThey had to go into the manual setup,\nthey had to go into a configure\n\n223\n00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.050\nbecause maybe the SMTP was on a different\nport, or something to that effect.\n\n224\n00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:36.320\nBut it's like no, the auto detection\nisn't working to where it knows all of\n\n225\n00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.940\nthese settings automatically, so maybe\nyou have to go through the manual setup.\n\n226\n00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:45.214\nIn the previous episode, I talked about\nthat I have a cox.net account with my\n\n227\n00:12:45.214 --> 00:12:50.080\nemail because that's my cable provider,\nand they provided me with an email.\n\n228\n00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.588\nI haven't used it in a really long\ntime [LAUGH], but I still have it and\n\n229\n00:12:53.588 --> 00:12:55.262\nit's still part of my account.\n\n230\n00:12:55.262 --> 00:13:00.004\nSo I wanna show you that I actually\nbrought up, I typed in my search,\n\n231\n00:13:00.004 --> 00:13:02.730\nI typed in cox email settings.\n\n232\n00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.690\nAnd it shows right here, there we go.\n\n233\n00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:07.840\nLet's go ahead and\nshow you how you can go ahead and\n\n234\n00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.480\nset up your client,\nwhatever email clients you're working on.\n\n235\n00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.212\nAnd this could be Outlook or\n\n236\n00:13:14.212 --> 00:13:19.197\nThunderbird, I think that was an older\none back in the day, but you could use.\n\n237\n00:13:19.197 --> 00:13:21.316\nIn fact, I'm damn sure some\npeople still use it maybe.\n\n238\n00:13:21.316 --> 00:13:25.228\n[LAUGH] But I just kind of\nassociate it with back in the day.\n\n239\n00:13:25.228 --> 00:13:26.969\nSo you can see that it's going through and\n\n240\n00:13:26.969 --> 00:13:29.940\ntrying to give you a little bit more\ninformation about, what is IMAP?\n\n241\n00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.230\nWhat is POP?\n\n242\n00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.990\nAnd then it goes through,\nand you can see right here.\n\n243\n00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:38.380\nThese are the IMAP settings for cox\ncommunication, and it's listening on this\n\n244\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:42.653\nparticular port with an SSL secure\nsocket layer, is that correct, Ronnie?\n\n245\n00:13:42.653 --> 00:13:43.762\n&gt;&gt; That is.\n&gt;&gt; All right, good,\n\n246\n00:13:43.762 --> 00:13:45.038\nthat Net Plus is coming back to me.\n\n247\n00:13:45.038 --> 00:13:50.196\n[LAUGH] And so it's seeing that\nyou might have to go in and\n\n248\n00:13:50.196 --> 00:13:54.030\nmanually type in these settings.\n\n249\n00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.170\nAnd you could see that it has\nalso has the POP accounts, or\n\n250\n00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.150\nthe POP3 account settings as well.\n\n251\n00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:04.710\nSo where would I go ahead and\nenter that into in Outlook?\n\n252\n00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:09.042\nWhen I go back over here to my file, and\nI'm gonna go to my Account Settings,\n\n253\n00:14:09.042 --> 00:14:10.849\nI'm gonna click on Accounts Settings.\n\n254\n00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.093\nAnd I'm gonna go through and\nclick on the New.\n\n255\n00:14:14.093 --> 00:14:19.009\nAnd I'm not gonna actually finish the\nsetup, but I wanted to show you that this\n\n256\n00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:23.947\nis doing a auto setup right here,\nmanual setup, or additional server types.\n\n257\n00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:27.628\nCuz I need to put in that extra\ninformation because that it's a different\n\n258\n00:14:27.628 --> 00:14:29.860\nport or something to that effect.\n\n259\n00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:33.124\nSo I'll go ahead and click on that,\nI'll click on Next, and\n\n260\n00:14:33.124 --> 00:14:37.689\nit's going to, sorry, [LAUGH] I was like,\nand it's, it's already there.\n\n261\n00:14:37.689 --> 00:14:39.038\n[LAUGH] I just had to read my screen.\n\n262\n00:14:39.038 --> 00:14:41.831\nSo you can see,\nare you setting up in Office 365?\n\n263\n00:14:41.831 --> 00:14:46.020\nNo, I'm setting up a POP or\nan IMAP setting.\n\n264\n00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.270\nOr you could see there is\nan Exchange option here, too.\n\n265\n00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.400\nBut we'll stick on the POP and the IMAP.\n\n266\n00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.473\nWe'll go ahead and click Next, and you\ncan see you can put in your username and\n\n267\n00:14:55.473 --> 00:14:58.052\nemail, like you had in\nthe auto configuration.\n\n268\n00:14:58.052 --> 00:15:02.949\nBut this is where you can tell it\nwhich type of protocol you're using,\n\n269\n00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:04.943\nwhether the POP or the IMAP.\n\n270\n00:15:04.943 --> 00:15:10.008\nAnd then you can type in those addresses\nthat are given to you on your settings,\n\n271\n00:15:10.008 --> 00:15:14.693\nwhether it's in cox communication or\nuniversity or whatever your cable\n\n272\n00:15:14.693 --> 00:15:19.171\nprovider, your telecommunications\nprovider is going to give you.\n\n273\n00:15:19.171 --> 00:15:22.501\nYou might have to go into the settings\nhere, and then type them in,\n\n274\n00:15:22.501 --> 00:15:24.289\nput in your username and password.\n\n275\n00:15:24.289 --> 00:15:28.003\nAnd then go ahead and\nlet it do its thing, and then hopefully,\n\n276\n00:15:28.003 --> 00:15:31.157\nit'll say, yep, I'm all good,\nI'm ready to go.\n\n277\n00:15:31.157 --> 00:15:32.750\nAnd you have everything set up.\n\n278\n00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:39.366\nSo sometimes, you might need a more of\na manual installation of your accounts.\n\n279\n00:15:39.366 --> 00:15:43.732\nBut for the most part, I would say\nthat it's, I don't wanna say it's so\n\n280\n00:15:43.732 --> 00:15:46.340\neasy because it's easy if it works.\n\n281\n00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.860\nWhen it doesn't work,\nthat's when it's like no, this isn't easy.\n\n282\n00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.588\nSo if you ever needed a little\nbit more tech support,\n\n283\n00:15:51.588 --> 00:15:55.880\nI mean there's always reasons why it\ndoesn't connect for one reason or another.\n\n284\n00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.927\nAnd that's why you might need to\neither contact your IT department or\n\n285\n00:15:59.927 --> 00:16:02.648\ncall somebody or\ntake it to another provider,\n\n286\n00:16:02.648 --> 00:16:07.003\nsome type of service provider that\nwill allow you to get some assistance.\n\n287\n00:16:07.003 --> 00:16:11.461\nBut for the most part,\nIt should go ahead and get you setup.\n\n288\n00:16:11.461 --> 00:16:15.781\nNow I do have, I want to just jump\nover really quick to show you Lance,\n\n289\n00:16:15.781 --> 00:16:17.658\nokay because now I'm Lance.\n\n290\n00:16:17.658 --> 00:16:20.608\nLance is setup to where you can have\n\n291\n00:16:20.608 --> 00:16:25.100\nOutlook be able to manage\nmultiple email accounts.\n\n292\n00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:29.206\nSo you can see that Lance is set\nup on lance@officeprodemo.co.\n\n293\n00:16:29.206 --> 00:16:32.591\nNow I know this is Chris, but\nlet's pretend that Lance and\n\n294\n00:16:32.591 --> 00:16:34.470\nChrise are the same person.\n\n295\n00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:39.677\nSo I can have Outlook setup to\nbring in my Office ProMail.\n\n296\n00:16:39.677 --> 00:16:42.388\nI could also had it bring in my Gmail.\n\n297\n00:16:42.388 --> 00:16:44.613\nI could have it bring in my Yahoo.\n\n298\n00:16:44.613 --> 00:16:48.035\nI mean you can have it\nmanage multiple accounts, or\n\n299\n00:16:48.035 --> 00:16:52.492\nthis could be maybe you work in\nan office to where you are in charge,\n\n300\n00:16:52.492 --> 00:16:57.427\nmaybe you're some type of assistant or\na helper to where you actually have\n\n301\n00:16:57.427 --> 00:17:01.040\naccess to one of your coworkers or\nyour boss email.\n\n302\n00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.020\nAnd you have your inbox,\nyou also have somebody else's inbox.\n\n303\n00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.292\nNow that's not, that's a little different.\n\n304\n00:17:06.292 --> 00:17:10.853\nThat's not the same as like setting up\nyour Gmail and like two different mail\n\n305\n00:17:10.853 --> 00:17:15.272\naccounts, but you can also set it up\nto where you can delegate, people can\n\n306\n00:17:15.272 --> 00:17:20.141\ndelegate you to be an authenticated user,\nif you want to say from their account.\n\n307\n00:17:20.141 --> 00:17:24.170\nSo you might see over here; you\nmight have multiple inboxes.\n\n308\n00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.740\nThat's what it supposed to do,\nits allowed and its able to do that.\n\n309\n00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:31.280\nSo it just depends on how many\naccounts you need to manage or\n\n310\n00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.310\nhow many accounts do you want to manage.\n\n311\n00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:37.620\nSo it can be configured multiple ways and\njust to show you back in that\n\n312\n00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.880\naccount settings to where you can say\nthat there are multiple accounts.\n\n313\n00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.180\nOne is using Microsoft Exchange,\nits like well wait, I'm not on and\n\n314\n00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:49.730\nexchange server, but\nOffice 365 is almost like\n\n315\n00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:53.140\nthe biggest exchange server you\ncould ever get if you wanna say.\n\n316\n00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:57.220\nWe're not, like there's nobody within our\norganization here that is managing that\n\n317\n00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.570\nexchange server, it is Office 365.\n\n318\n00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.862\nSo don't let that confuse\nyou of like wait,\n\n319\n00:18:02.862 --> 00:18:08.310\nI thought you said they're different,\nsame but different you know my saying.\n\n320\n00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:13.265\nSo it will detect that it is still\na Microsoft product as opposed to you can\n\n321\n00:18:13.265 --> 00:18:16.608\nsee those Gmail account\nthat I have configured.\n\n322\n00:18:16.608 --> 00:18:20.388\nThis is using that IMAP and SMTP and\nwe know what those things are,\n\n323\n00:18:20.388 --> 00:18:23.080\nbecause we went over on so about that.\n\n324\n00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.860\nSo we've got that.\n\n325\n00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.233\nWell last thing that I wanna go\nover is removing an account.\n\n326\n00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:32.913\nNow let me jump back over to JT,\nand Ronnie, you and\n\n327\n00:18:32.913 --> 00:18:35.576\nI actually had to ask you about this.\n\n328\n00:18:35.576 --> 00:18:37.023\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I'm like hey,\n\n329\n00:18:37.023 --> 00:18:38.517\nwhy isn't this working?\n\n330\n00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:43.058\nBecause if we jump over to the website but\nby getting started with Outlook,\n\n331\n00:18:43.058 --> 00:18:46.680\nit's like Go ahead,\nI think there's one remove, right?\n\n332\n00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.827\nRemove an account from Outlook and\nit just says, go ahead and\n\n333\n00:18:49.827 --> 00:18:52.060\njust click on the account and\ngo to step 3.\n\n334\n00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:57.413\nSorry, moving around and\nit's like just click on the email and\n\n335\n00:18:57.413 --> 00:19:04.060\njust say remove, and then you're done,\n[LAUGH] It's not that simple.\n\n336\n00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.480\nIt is simple, but there is one extra step,\nat least that I noticed,\n\n337\n00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.540\nbecause I have been playing\naround with all these accounts.\n\n338\n00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.329\nAdding accounts, deleting accounts,\n\n339\n00:19:12.329 --> 00:19:14.970\njust going all sorts of crazy\nof getting these shows set up.\n\n340\n00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.950\nSo let me show you.\n\n341\n00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.290\nIf I come over here to JT's account, and\n\n342\n00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:23.050\nI say that I would like to go ahead and\nI want to remove this.\n\n343\n00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:24.740\nI'm going to say, remove'.\n\n344\n00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.420\nI was gonna say,\nwell before you do that you can't.\n\n345\n00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.384\nYou have to create a new data file and\nbe able,\n\n346\n00:19:31.384 --> 00:19:36.000\nonce you create a new data file,\nthen you can go ahead and delete this.\n\n347\n00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.251\nNow remember, just before I go any\nfurther, if I'm deleting this account that\n\n348\n00:19:39.251 --> 00:19:42.310\ndoesn't mean that I'm removing every\nsingle email that I've ever done or\n\n349\n00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.298\never lived ever since.\n\n350\n00:19:43.298 --> 00:19:46.400\nAnd because remember,\nIt all lives on the server, doesn't it?\n\n351\n00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.010\nI'm just using my email client.\n\n352\n00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:51.670\nSo I would be deleting\nthe account from my email client.\n\n353\n00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.610\nNot all of the information in my account.\n\n354\n00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.060\nSo let's clarify that before.\n\n355\n00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.040\nBut because you have this\non your local machine.\n\n356\n00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.320\nThey use something called a data\nfile to be able to store all that\n\n357\n00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.910\nlocal information on this computer.\n\n358\n00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:10.080\nSo like, your settings, things with\nyour calendars and your emails.\n\n359\n00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.640\nLike all of that is going to need to\nbe somewhat configured on your machine.\n\n360\n00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.720\nAnd that's what this is saying.\n\n361\n00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.845\nIt's like,\nwell I can't delete it unless you give me,\n\n362\n00:20:18.845 --> 00:20:20.852\nit's almost like a backup, okay?\n\n363\n00:20:20.852 --> 00:20:24.290\nSo let's go over here to data files.\n\n364\n00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.469\nNow I don't wanna go too deep into this\nparticular area, because we will be\n\n365\n00:20:27.469 --> 00:20:30.880\ntalking a lot about this when we get\ninto archiving, won't we Ronnie?\n\n366\n00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.950\nSo we'll be talking more\nabout what this means and\n\n367\n00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.900\nhow you can use it to be able to force it,\nand\n\n368\n00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.510\narchive and what it means to retrieve\nyour information and things like that.\n\n369\n00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.940\nBut again,\nthink about it as a backup o f like,\n\n370\n00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.400\nsomething that I can always go\nback to reconfigure everything and\n\n371\n00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.690\nhave everything just kind\nof get right back in here.\n\n372\n00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:52.110\nSo I would actually have\nto add the data file.\n\n373\n00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:56.207\nMake it, I can just say, okay sure fine,\nwhatever, make my Outlook go ahead and\n\n374\n00:20:56.207 --> 00:20:57.130\nget that backup.\n\n375\n00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:00.491\nAnd then you would have to make\nthat your primary, is that right?\n\n376\n00:21:00.491 --> 00:21:05.230\nYou would have to make that\nsecondary data file as your default.\n\n377\n00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.550\nYou can see there's some things right\nin here that I can set as default.\n\n378\n00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:12.660\nSo you make your backup your default,\nthen you can remove your account, and\n\n379\n00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:13.620\nthen everything's fine.\n\n380\n00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:17.900\nSo again, if you have some issues, you\nmight have to call somebody, ask for help.\n\n381\n00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.690\nI had to call Ronnie, cuz I was just like,\n\n382\n00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:23.990\nwell I just peeked over the part and I'm\nlike hey Ronnie, come over and help me.\n\n383\n00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.870\nSo, he had to kind of walk me through a\nlittle bit about how to make this happen.\n\n384\n00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.070\nBut once I did, I was able to delete\nthe JT account and it was fine.\n\n385\n00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:35.020\nAnd if you don't know about what a data\nfile is, you can say tell me more.\n\n386\n00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:39.715\nAnd it actually takes you out to\nthe support.office.com and it says,\n\n387\n00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:44.175\nwell let's go ahead and introduce\nyou to a PST and an OST account, or\n\n388\n00:21:44.175 --> 00:21:46.694\nnot an account, I'm sorry, files.\n\n389\n00:21:46.694 --> 00:21:48.989\nAnd you can see that\nit's going through and\n\n390\n00:21:48.989 --> 00:21:52.370\nsays that your Outlook data file\ncontains all your messages and\n\n391\n00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:56.700\neverything that's stored on your\ncomputer and what this means.\n\n392\n00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.570\nWhat our OST file is.\n\n393\n00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:02.360\nAgain, we're not having to go too far\ninto this lesson right now of like what\n\n394\n00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.130\nthis all means.\n\n395\n00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.410\nBut I just at least wanted to\ngive you that little tidbit,\n\n396\n00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:07.320\nbecause I know I ran into it.\n\n397\n00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.320\nSo if you're going to try to remove an\naccount you're probably gonna run into it\n\n398\n00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.140\nif you have an Office 365 account.\n\n399\n00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.272\nSo just giving you a little heads up,\nbut once you get that data file,\n\n400\n00:22:16.272 --> 00:22:17.144\nyou can delete it.\n\n401\n00:22:17.144 --> 00:22:22.147\nAnd then if you want, you can reinstall it\nlike I did at least three or four times.\n\n402\n00:22:22.147 --> 00:22:24.310\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, Vonne.\n\n403\n00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:29.750\nWell that's a great introduction to the\nidea of setting up an email account for\n\n404\n00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.100\nour Outlook client that we have.\n\n405\n00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:36.110\nMost of the time when you're setting this\nup, the great thing is really all you need\n\n406\n00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:39.290\nis your email address and you're password\nto make sure you can confirm it.\n\n407\n00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.460\nAnd if everything else\nis working correctly,\n\n408\n00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.750\nit's just kind of clicking next and\nafter a while it will set it up.\n\n409\n00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.480\nBut Vonne also showed us\nthe ability to go and\n\n410\n00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.610\nmanually configured it when nothing\nworks exactly the way that it should.\n\n411\n00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:54.405\nThere maybe some manual settings\nwe also have to put in there.\n\n412\n00:22:54.405 --> 00:22:58.910\nThere are times when when\nthe easiest fixes is to delete\n\n413\n00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:03.160\nthe account as well another remove it, and\nthen they have it at you replaced again.\n\n414\n00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.615\nBut before that Outlook wants\nto protect you by saying,\n\n415\n00:23:05.615 --> 00:23:10.670\nlet's make sure we have a good backup just\nin case nothing goes well at this point.\n\n416\n00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:12.840\nAnd then have to move over\nto a different computer.\n\n417\n00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.400\nThen you can also take your emails and\nall of the other settings with it too.\n\n418\n00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.360\nSo it's a great introduction to\nall of these different things\n\n419\n00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.670\nthat you may find useful as you\nstart dealing with Outlook.\n\n420\n00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:26.220\nBecause you are connecting\nto a live server\n\n421\n00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:30.240\nas you are actually retrieving emails and\nsending emails.\n\n422\n00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.140\nAnd some of the stuff can work really\nwell, some of it may not work well.\n\n423\n00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.588\nSo it's a good introduction.\n\n424\n00:23:35.588 --> 00:23:38.840\nThank you Vonne, for\nhelping us to get started here.\n\n425\n00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.089\nAnd thank you also for watching.\n\n426\n00:23:40.089 --> 00:23:42.610\nGreat place for us to sign off.\n\n427\n00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:45.430\nFor OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n428\n00:23:45.430 -->

00:00:10.990\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.166\nAnd today you're watching Outlook 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:18.360\nWe are about to get started\nnavigating the Outlook interface.\n\n6\n00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.878\nAnd here to help us in that navigation\npattern is gonna be Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:21.878 --> 00:00:23.230\nVonne, welcome back to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.800\n&gt;&gt; Hi, Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.877\nHello, everyone.\n\n10\n00:00:24.877 --> 00:00:27.920\nYes we're going to be\nexploring our environment.\n\n11\n00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.211\nWe're going to be getting familiar\nwith our different tabs and\n\n12\n00:00:31.211 --> 00:00:33.582\nwhat is a ribbon and\nwhat is our status phone.\n\n13\n00:00:33.582 --> 00:00:35.175\nWhere do I find my contacts?\n\n14\n00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:38.208\nAll of those different things\nto just kinda get us started so\n\n15\n00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:42.029\nwe know where we're going when we really\nstart diving in to our emailing and\n\n16\n00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:43.746\nour calendars and our contacts.\n\n17\n00:00:43.746 --> 00:00:48.260\nNow to do this and tasks and, well I guess\nwe're tasking to this whole same things.\n\n18\n00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.240\nBut anyways, why don't we go ahead and\njump down into my computer,\n\n19\n00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.340\nand, these computers are a little slower.\n\n20\n00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.615\nI'm actually on my backup\ncomputer right now.\n\n21\n00:00:57.615 --> 00:01:01.091\nI'm on my personal computer it's\nlike seven years old actually.\n\n22\n00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:05.767\nIt's still kicking pretty good, but\nit's a little slower than my new computer,\n\n23\n00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:07.790\nwhich is in the shop right now.\n\n24\n00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.984\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nstart Outlook up.\n\n25\n00:01:10.984 --> 00:01:14.870\nActually I'm just bringing it up from\nthe taskbar right here to go ahead and\n\n26\n00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:15.740\nget it started.\n\n27\n00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.236\nSo this is what Outlook is always going\nto open up to when you start Outlook\n\n28\n00:01:20.236 --> 00:01:24.971\nbecause this is when it's configured\nby default as to open up to your email.\n\n29\n00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:28.247\nYou could change it if you want to,\nand I can show you that, but\n\n30\n00:01:28.247 --> 00:01:31.650\nthis is the default view for\nopen outlook, here is your email.\n\n31\n00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.590\nAnd this is where we always start.\n\n32\n00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.508\nWhere are different pieces,\n\n33\n00:01:35.508 --> 00:01:40.043\nof pretty much every single thing\nthat you use in any office products?\n\n34\n00:01:40.043 --> 00:01:41.019\nThey're all gonna be the same.\n\n35\n00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:44.493\nSo if you've heard this, that we've talked\nabout in PowerPoint we've talked about\n\n36\n00:01:44.493 --> 00:01:46.680\nthis in Word,\nit's gonna be the same in Outlook too.\n\n37\n00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.780\nSo, let's start with the title bar.\n\n38\n00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.556\nWhere is our title bar?\n\n39\n00:01:49.556 --> 00:01:51.740\nThe title bar is up at the top.\n\n40\n00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.883\nIt's in the blue right now,\nbecause my Office is configure right now,\n\n41\n00:01:55.883 --> 00:01:58.521\nwith a default theme and\nbackground colors.\n\n42\n00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:03.028\nSo you that it says inbox, there's my\nemail address, and this is Outlook.\n\n43\n00:02:03.028 --> 00:02:07.584\nOn that same title bar, you're going to\nhave your basic way of controls like your\n\n44\n00:02:07.584 --> 00:02:09.750\nminimize, and then it goes down.\n\n45\n00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.130\nAnd then if you click on it you\nhave your maximize button as well.\n\n46\n00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.090\nWhich is, actually is restore down now\nbecause I already had it maximized.\n\n47\n00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.130\nSo if I go ahead and maximize it and\nof course we have our big red X, and\n\n48\n00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.100\nthat's over on the right hand corner.\n\n49\n00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.750\nI'm not gonna close it right now because\nlike I said it's gonna take a while for\n\n50\n00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.710\nthis baby to get back up.\n\n51\n00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.900\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and\nkeep it open.\n\n52\n00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.360\nBut that is our title bar.\n\n53\n00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.867\nThe other major component of every Office\n\n54\n00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:37.809\nproduct is going to be\nour Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n55\n00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:41.860\nThe Quick Access Toolbar is up in\nthe left hand corner of the top.\n\n56\n00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.565\nThis Quick Access Toolbar is, well,\nthere to quickly access different\n\n57\n00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:50.897\ncommands on that bar for\nyou to be able to perform different tasks.\n\n58\n00:02:50.897 --> 00:02:56.870\nSay like saving or printing or\nother things that you might wanna do.\n\n59\n00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.420\nI can't think of any other ones right now.\n\n60\n00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.804\nBut that is the Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n61\n00:03:00.804 --> 00:03:03.260\nRight below that,\nyou're going to have your ribbon.\n\n62\n00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.782\nThe ribbon has a bunch of tabs along\nthe way that you can be able to click on,\n\n63\n00:03:08.782 --> 00:03:12.094\nto be able to access\nmore of those commands.\n\n64\n00:03:12.094 --> 00:03:16.792\nBecause I'm in my email section right now\nI'm going to have things like on my home\n\n65\n00:03:16.792 --> 00:03:19.901\ntab I would have things like New email and\nDelete, and\n\n66\n00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:25.110\nsome other things that are going across\nhere on this particular tab on the ribbon.\n\n67\n00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.629\nThere's also a send and receive tab that\nyou can use too well, send and receive.\n\n68\n00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:34.299\n[LAUGH] There is also some folder and\nsome views and that's all\n\n69\n00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.234\nthe tab that I have right now on this\nparticular ribbon of where at right now.\n\n70\n00:03:39.234 --> 00:03:42.599\nMore on that on just a little bit\nlike what do you mean where you're at\n\n71\n00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.050\nright now?\n\n72\n00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.120\nI'll tell you.\n\n73\n00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.457\nBut on that on this ribbon you are always\ngonna have your File tab but that File tab\n\n74\n00:03:49.457 --> 00:03:53.429\nworks a little bit differently than\nsome of the other tabs in the ribbon.\n\n75\n00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:56.900\nBecause it actually takes you to\nwhat's called the back Sage view.\n\n76\n00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.051\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick on this and do you see it kind of.\n\n77\n00:04:00.051 --> 00:04:03.537\nIt almost it shows you it kind of moves\nover a little bit to show you what's\n\n78\n00:04:03.537 --> 00:04:04.780\nbehind the scenes.\n\n79\n00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.478\nAnd so this is what replaced the old\nfile menu from way back in the day of\n\n80\n00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:13.134\nwhere you have things such as save as,\nprint, exit.\n\n81\n00:04:13.134 --> 00:04:17.222\nAll the same things that you would\nnormally find on a file menu if you had\n\n82\n00:04:17.222 --> 00:04:22.180\na regular menu bar across in some of\nyour older versions of these products.\n\n83\n00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.188\nAnd right here you can\nsee I have the info.\n\n84\n00:04:24.188 --> 00:04:27.390\nWe've actually already been to this screen\nbefore when we were talking about setting\n\n85\n00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.820\nup our e-mail accounts.\n\n86\n00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.310\nAnd you can see that there's\naccount settings and\n\n87\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.350\nthe different things that\nare on that intro tab.\n\n88\n00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.110\nSuch as your rules and\nalerts we'll be talking about.\n\n89\n00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.200\nWe'll also talk about how\nto set up your auto office,\n\n90\n00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.630\nyour automatic replies to certain things.\n\n91\n00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.740\nAnd of course,\nwhere you can manage your add-ins, and\n\n92\n00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.710\nthen also shows you your mailbox settings.\n\n93\n00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.425\nAnd that's actually something really good\nto know where it's at, because you might\n\n94\n00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:56.077\nhave some limitations especially depending\nupon your organization sets of how much\n\n95\n00:04:56.077 --> 00:05:00.286\nyou can really kinda keep in your inbox,\nor in your Outlook if you wanna say.\n\n96\n00:05:00.286 --> 00:05:02.560\nSo you might wanna watch that, and\n\n97\n00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.025\nsay see now I've got quite\na few I've got what 99 gigs?\n\n98\n00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:09.302\n&gt;&gt; Free.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I don't think I'll be using\n\n99\n00:05:09.302 --> 00:05:11.105\nall that up anytime soon, so.\n\n100\n00:05:11.105 --> 00:05:14.940\nBut that might not be the same one as\nyours because you have different setups.\n\n101\n00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.373\nAnd just a little bit more on\nthis Office 365 account settings.\n\n102\n00:05:18.373 --> 00:05:19.440\nYou see this picture?\n\n103\n00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.661\nThis actually came from my account\nsettings that I have set as well my\n\n104\n00:05:23.661 --> 00:05:25.446\naccounting Office 365.\n\n105\n00:05:25.446 --> 00:05:30.166\nAnd since that's a nice try to think about\nyour Office 365 subscription has like once\n\n106\n00:05:30.166 --> 00:05:32.353\nyou go ahead and configure everything.\n\n107\n00:05:32.353 --> 00:05:34.477\nLike this is my profile\nit's going to come down and\n\n108\n00:05:34.477 --> 00:05:37.630\nto all of your products because well\nit's all connected to your account.\n\n109\n00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.291\nAnd so there you go here, you also have\nyour open and export is where you can see\n\n110\n00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:46.690\nyou can open and export different\noptions within either your computer.\n\n111\n00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.380\nOr you can import from other\nplaces whether it's your\n\n112\n00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.330\nown maybe somebody else's stuff so\nyou can do that.\n\n113\n00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.716\n&gt;&gt; Your Save as this is where it's\ngoing to, well, save as certain things.\n\n114\n00:05:55.716 --> 00:05:57.161\nNow, was it saving?\n\n115\n00:05:57.161 --> 00:06:00.671\nAgain a little bit more of where that's\ngonna come from in a little bit,\n\n116\n00:06:00.671 --> 00:06:03.080\nbut it all depends on\nwhere you're at right now.\n\n117\n00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.203\nRight now I was specifically on\na particular e-mail, and so it's asking\n\n118\n00:06:08.203 --> 00:06:13.590\nme to save that e-mail in whatever sort\nof format that I might want to save.\n\n119\n00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.136\nSo if you were somewhere else,\nyou would get other options.\n\n120\n00:06:17.136 --> 00:06:18.295\nAgain, I'll get there.\n\n121\n00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:19.840\n[LAUGH] So, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n122\n00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.670\ncancel out that, and go back over to\nthe file, and you can see the print.\n\n123\n00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.590\nWhat do you think I'm gonna say, Ronnie?\n\n124\n00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.427\n&gt;&gt; Print.\n&gt;&gt; Print, [LAUGH] And it all depends on?\n\n125\n00:06:28.427 --> 00:06:29.470\n&gt;&gt; Where you're at.\n\n126\n00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.430\n&gt;&gt; Where you're at right now.\n\n127\n00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.500\nSo, if I'm going to be printing,\nit's going to try and\n\n128\n00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.220\nprint out that email message and\nso that's perfect and you can see.\n\n129\n00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.761\nWhoops sorry.\nAnd you can see some of our other options.\n\n130\n00:06:38.761 --> 00:06:42.255\nOur Office account, this is\nthe place where I said in the title,\n\n131\n00:06:42.255 --> 00:06:44.570\nby the title bar's blue.\n\n132\n00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.090\nAnd it has these little\npictures over towards the top.\n\n133\n00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.063\nThese are all things that you can control\nwithin your Office account settings of\n\n134\n00:06:51.063 --> 00:06:54.811\nlike maybe changing, maybe I don't\nwant the circle and stripes anymore.\n\n135\n00:06:54.811 --> 00:06:57.130\nI want some doodle circles.\n\n136\n00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.808\nOoh, those are cute.\n\n137\n00:06:57.808 --> 00:07:00.430\nOr maybe some lunch boxes.\n\n138\n00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.497\nI always seem to talk about food\nwhen I'm on these episodes.\n\n139\n00:07:02.497 --> 00:07:04.130\nIt always starts making me hungry.\n\n140\n00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.962\nSo maybe I'll stick with the stars.\n\n141\n00:07:05.962 --> 00:07:08.532\nI think I'm gonna just stick\nwith the circle and stripes, but\n\n142\n00:07:08.532 --> 00:07:10.361\nI wanted to show you\nwhere you could do this,\n\n143\n00:07:10.361 --> 00:07:13.098\nright here to kinda just give it\na little more of a personal touch.\n\n144\n00:07:13.098 --> 00:07:17.943\nAs to what you want those graphics\nto be up in your title bar in ribbon\n\n145\n00:07:17.943 --> 00:07:20.116\narea within your interface.\n\n146\n00:07:20.116 --> 00:07:25.280\nAnd you can also change,\nI don't really like the dark grey.\n\n147\n00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.012\nActually I don't really mind this one,\nbut for\n\n148\n00:07:27.012 --> 00:07:29.623\ndemonstration purposes I really just\nlike to stick with the colorful.\n\n149\n00:07:29.623 --> 00:07:33.847\nBecause blue is always Outlook,\norange is always PowerPoint.\n\n150\n00:07:33.847 --> 00:07:35.936\nActually blue is usually Word.\n\n151\n00:07:35.936 --> 00:07:36.791\nNow that I think about it.\n\n152\n00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:37.344\n&gt;&gt; Dark blue now.\n\n153\n00:07:37.344 --> 00:07:37.904\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n154\n00:07:37.904 --> 00:07:38.973\n&gt;&gt; Very dark blue.\n\n155\n00:07:38.973 --> 00:07:40.030\n&gt;&gt; You're right.\n\n156\n00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.787\nYes, the dark blue, and then Outlook\nis the light blue and Excel is green.\n\n157\n00:07:42.787 --> 00:07:46.900\nSo I just associate those colors,\nso I don't even change this.\n\n158\n00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.018\nBut it's up to you.\n\n159\n00:07:48.018 --> 00:07:51.434\nThis is other place where you can find\nwhat version of Outlook that you're\n\n160\n00:07:51.434 --> 00:07:52.049\nworking on.\n\n161\n00:07:52.049 --> 00:07:55.504\nLIke I can see that I have and\nOffice 365 Pro Plus Account.\n\n162\n00:07:55.504 --> 00:07:56.671\nAnd it also shows the version.\n\n163\n00:07:56.671 --> 00:08:00.713\nSometimes those versions can make\na difference as to like Maybe one of your\n\n164\n00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:02.929\ncoworkers has a feature in Office that,\n\n165\n00:08:02.929 --> 00:08:05.880\nlike in PowerPoint,\nhow did you get that zoom thing?\n\n166\n00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.520\nI didn't know there was zoom, I don't\nhave zoom, or, I have the emojis or\n\n167\n00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.030\nthe icons in there.\n\n168\n00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.890\nWell you might be on a different build or\nversion of your Office 365 account,\n\n169\n00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.450\nand you haven't gotten those updates yet.\n\n170\n00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:21.230\nSo sometimes kinda interesting to find,\nor at least know where it is.\n\n171\n00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.803\nBecause you'd go out and\nlook at documentations, it's only for\n\n172\n00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:26.630\nversion [SOUND], and you're like,\nwell I don't have that version.\n\n173\n00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.812\nOkay, so\nI should probably go out and update.\n\n174\n00:08:28.812 --> 00:08:33.510\nSo different things there, and\nyou can see the feedback and support.\n\n175\n00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.420\nThose are all the different things that\nMicrosoft has in all of their products,\n\n176\n00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.490\nwhere you could give\nfeedback on certain things.\n\n177\n00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.490\nAnd then always right there, your options,\nI will just say, we're not gonna go\n\n178\n00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.040\nthrough these right now, but\nI just wanted to show you where they are.\n\n179\n00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:52.090\nThere are a ton of options in Outlook,\nI mean, a lot of them.\n\n180\n00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.850\nSo you can see, in the options,\nthe different subcategories of, how do you\n\n181\n00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:59.490\nwanna change you mail, and your calendar,\nand your group, you can go through these.\n\n182\n00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.170\nWe're gonna be going\nthrough these here and\n\n183\n00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:05.130\nthere throughout the entire series\nthat we're talking about here.\n\n184\n00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.346\nSo I want to kind of pull\nthem up as needed, and\n\n185\n00:09:08.346 --> 00:09:11.750\nwhen they're the most applicable.\n\n186\n00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:12.930\nWell, I already said one,\n\n187\n00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.710\nremember, the default of where\nalways opens up in your inbox?\n\n188\n00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.275\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Well, where it that?\n\n189\n00:09:17.275 --> 00:09:20.566\nIt's in the Advanced, and\nin the Advanced section,\n\n190\n00:09:20.566 --> 00:09:23.850\nyou can see right there,\nOutlook start and exit.\n\n191\n00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.480\nStart Outlook in this folder, inbox.\n\n192\n00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.250\nSo if you wanted to change it, maybe you\nwanna start in your calendar or whatever,\n\n193\n00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.890\nyou could always do that there.\n\n194\n00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.292\nEmpty deleted folders\nwhen exiting Outlook.\n\n195\n00:09:34.292 --> 00:09:37.862\nWhen we start talking about what is the\ndeleted items, and where is your trash,\n\n196\n00:09:37.862 --> 00:09:39.100\ndo you want that to happen?\n\n197\n00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:44.500\nSo you can see already right here,\njust in the Advanced section, there's\n\n198\n00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.100\na bunch of things that I could configure,\nand it keeps on going down the list.\n\n199\n00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.085\nSo, definitely check out your\noptions; if something's not right,\n\n200\n00:09:51.085 --> 00:09:53.790\nor you want something to\nbe configured differently,\n\n201\n00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.360\nthis is usually the place\nwhere you can find it.\n\n202\n00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.890\nSo, that was of course,\nour exploration into the File or\n\n203\n00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.360\nthe backstage view of Outlook.\n\n204\n00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.028\nI'm going to go,\n\n205\n00:10:03.028 --> 00:10:05.622\nwhoops, I didn't mean to go back\nover to File, I meant to go to Home.\n\n206\n00:10:05.622 --> 00:10:10.233\nNow, I did say something about\nwhere you are at right now,\n\n207\n00:10:10.233 --> 00:10:13.850\nthat's really an important place to know.\n\n208\n00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:20.380\nI'm in my Email, but how do I get to my\ncalendar, how do I get to my contacts?\n\n209\n00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.141\nThey're there, they're just kinda hiding,\nif you [LAUGH] wanna say.\n\n210\n00:10:24.141 --> 00:10:28.334\nThey're down here, this area over\nhere on the left-hand side is called\n\n211\n00:10:28.334 --> 00:10:31.648\nyour folder pane, so\nthis general vicinity on the left.\n\n212\n00:10:31.648 --> 00:10:34.617\nAnd you can see that the little icon\nthat looks like a piece of mail,\n\n213\n00:10:34.617 --> 00:10:36.870\nwell, that's where you go for your mail.\n\n214\n00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.820\nThe thing that looks like a little\ncalendar, hm I wonder what that is?\n\n215\n00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.892\n&gt;&gt; Calendar.\n&gt;&gt; That's your calendar, [LAUGH] exactly,\n\n216\n00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:47.216\nso, if you click on it now,\nyou're in the calendar area of Outlook.\n\n217\n00:10:47.216 --> 00:10:49.445\nSo this is where you can configure,\n\n218\n00:10:49.445 --> 00:10:54.390\nyou can see that we had a canceled meeting\nin the band room over here on the 5th.\n\n219\n00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.240\nSo you can see that I\nalready have an appointment,\n\n220\n00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.360\nI don't have a lot going on here because\nwe're going to be adding appointments and\n\n221\n00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.490\neverything throughout our\ndifferent lessons and everything.\n\n222\n00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.672\nBut I wanted at least give you\na little bit to start with.\n\n223\n00:11:05.672 --> 00:11:08.310\nAnd so our calendar,\nnotice the Ribbon now?\n\n224\n00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:14.090\nMy Home tab on my Ribbon doesn't say\nnew email, it says New Appointment.\n\n225\n00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:18.480\nIt has the different arrangings of how\nI can be looking at certain things,\n\n226\n00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.430\nit talks about opening up calendars.\n\n227\n00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:26.290\nSo this Home tab is completely different\nnow, because I'm in the calendar section.\n\n228\n00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:29.411\nJust to reiterate,\nif I go back over to email or the mail,\n\n229\n00:11:29.411 --> 00:11:33.200\nmy Home tab switches over to New Mail and\ndifferent things like that.\n\n230\n00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.552\nSo what area, I'm gonna call them areas,\nand I might call them different things\n\n231\n00:11:37.552 --> 00:11:41.235\nthroughout the shows, but\nI'm calling it the areas of Outlook.\n\n232\n00:11:41.235 --> 00:11:44.009\nThat is really about where\nyou're at right now.\n\n233\n00:11:44.009 --> 00:11:49.764\nIf I go back over to that calendar, and I\ncome over here to File, and I go to Print,\n\n234\n00:11:49.764 --> 00:11:54.843\nnotice it's going to be printing out\ncalendars now instead of emails,\n\n235\n00:11:54.843 --> 00:11:57.570\ncuz that's the section I'm in.\n\n236\n00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.658\nSame thing with like my Save calendar,\n\n237\n00:11:59.658 --> 00:12:03.213\nSave is going to be different now\nbecause I'm in a different area.\n\n238\n00:12:03.213 --> 00:12:05.179\nLet's go back out there, all right so\n\n239\n00:12:05.179 --> 00:12:09.180\nif we keep on going to our other areas\nof Outlook, where else can we go?\n\n240\n00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:13.980\nWe can go into our contacts, and you might\nalso see that be referred to as people\n\n241\n00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:19.456\nnow, because I know that in Office 365, I\nthink they use people instead of contacts.\n\n242\n00:12:19.456 --> 00:12:20.200\nIs that right, Ronnie?\n\n243\n00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.882\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, perfect, so\n\n244\n00:12:21.882 --> 00:12:26.518\nwe're still going to see them as\ncontacts here in Outlook 2016, but\n\n245\n00:12:26.518 --> 00:12:30.486\nin case you hear that terminology and\nthose words being used.\n\n246\n00:12:30.486 --> 00:12:33.613\nSo this is where we, well,\nthis is our address book, so\n\n247\n00:12:33.613 --> 00:12:37.808\nthis is where we can go ahead and\nfind our contacts, and get phone numbers,\n\n248\n00:12:37.808 --> 00:12:41.293\nor addresses, or different things,\nyou can put birthdays.\n\n249\n00:12:41.293 --> 00:12:45.959\nYou can put whole bunch of information\nabout people, companies, or anything that\n\n250\n00:12:45.959 --> 00:12:50.038\nyou that you need to have in your\naddress book, or really your contacts.\n\n251\n00:12:50.038 --> 00:12:53.307\nNow I have some dot-dot-dots over here,\nyou might see a couple more icons in\n\n252\n00:12:53.307 --> 00:12:55.635\nyours, it depends on\nthe resolution of your monitor.\n\n253\n00:12:55.635 --> 00:12:59.430\nThat if I click on here you could see\nI have some other things like tasks.\n\n254\n00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:03.350\nThis is my to do list, so I could\ngo ahead and create to do lists for\n\n255\n00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:06.590\nmyself, just to be able to keep\nmyself organized, I need to do this.\n\n256\n00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.582\nAnd just like you had on a piece of paper,\nyou can cross them off,\n\n257\n00:13:09.582 --> 00:13:11.536\nyou can do the same thing here in Outlook.\n\n258\n00:13:11.536 --> 00:13:14.145\nI don't really have anything\non my To Do list right now, so\n\n259\n00:13:14.145 --> 00:13:15.294\nI guess we're done, bye.\n\n260\n00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:16.263\nI guess, no, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n261\n00:13:16.263 --> 00:13:17.813\n&gt;&gt; So we have our to do list here,\n\n262\n00:13:17.813 --> 00:13:22.540\nthere is some other things you can also\nuse within Outlook, they're called notes.\n\n263\n00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.525\nJust like a sticky note,\nyou're making a note to yourself.\n\n264\n00:13:25.525 --> 00:13:28.485\nJust like we had in our day planner that\nwe talked about in our introduction to\n\n265\n00:13:28.485 --> 00:13:30.535\nOutlook, you could go ahead and\ncreate notes here.\n\n266\n00:13:30.535 --> 00:13:34.002\nAnd my Home tab talks about a new note,\nmy View,\n\n267\n00:13:34.002 --> 00:13:37.133\nI also wanna concentrate on that View tab.\n\n268\n00:13:37.133 --> 00:13:41.717\nEvery time you're in a different area,\nyou're going to have a bunch of different\n\n269\n00:13:41.717 --> 00:13:44.700\nways that you can view what\narea you're looking at.\n\n270\n00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.945\nRight now I'm in the notes, you can\nsee I have large and small icons, and\n\n271\n00:13:48.945 --> 00:13:53.346\nI can do it in list view, I have nothing\nin here, so it's not gonna change.\n\n272\n00:13:53.346 --> 00:13:58.164\nBut if I go back over to calendar, notice\nmy view tab in the calendar is gonna\n\n273\n00:13:58.164 --> 00:14:00.930\ntalk about my day, my work week, my week.\n\n274\n00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:06.740\nWay different types of views in calendars,\nthan, I would even come into my mail, and\n\n275\n00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:12.270\nI go over to my View tab,\ndifferent ways that I can view my mail.\n\n276\n00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.510\nAnd all these different things, we will be\ngoing over, what is the folder pane, and\n\n277\n00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.440\nwe actually already know what\nthe folder pane is, right?\n\n278\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.450\nThe folder pane is the thing that's\nalways on the left-hand side,\n\n279\n00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:22.200\nno matter what area you're in.\n\n280\n00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.652\nLook at calendar,\nthere's that left-hand side, folder pane,\n\n281\n00:14:26.652 --> 00:14:29.437\nmy contacts, there is that folder pane.\n\n282\n00:14:29.437 --> 00:14:32.220\nAnd if I go to View,\nit's in every single one of them.\n\n283\n00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.450\nA lot of them have the same things, but\n\n284\n00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:39.170\nyou don't necessarily see reading panes\nand people panes in all of these areas.\n\n285\n00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.798\nBut they are going to be coming up and\n\n286\n00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:45.836\neach one of those areas'\nView tabs within the Ribbon.\n\n287\n00:14:45.836 --> 00:14:49.288\nSo if you wanted to start changing that,\nyou could start\n\n288\n00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:54.720\nexploring your different views, and\nyou can see how everything has changed.\n\n289\n00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.320\nSo if I wanted to take that folder\npane and make it minimized, right,\n\n290\n00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.970\ncuz maybe you came into Office and\nlike, well, sorry Outlook and I'm like,\n\n291\n00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.620\nthat's how mine looks.\n\n292\n00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.720\nWell, now that you know what the name is,\nyou can come over and say, no,\n\n293\n00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.150\nI want the folder pane to\nbe in the normal view.\n\n294\n00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.900\nAnd you can go through each one of them.\n\n295\n00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.180\nI'm gonna save some of these view options\nwhen we get into the email sections,\n\n296\n00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.750\nwhen we start talking about\nthe email interface specifically, or\n\n297\n00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.490\nthe calendar interface specifically.\n\n298\n00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:24.760\nSo I'll be going over in\na little bit more detail\n\n299\n00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.750\nin some of those other episodes\nwe can go through there.\n\n300\n00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:32.408\nSo but I just wanted to kind of give\nyou the whole basic idea of what's\n\n301\n00:15:32.408 --> 00:15:35.531\ngoing on in your different\nareas of Outlook.\n\n302\n00:15:35.531 --> 00:15:37.691\nSo if we keep on moving\ndown our interface,\n\n303\n00:15:37.691 --> 00:15:41.595\nwe have the very bottom-bottom,\nthe bottom-bottom, is that I just said?\n\n304\n00:15:41.595 --> 00:15:42.469\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n305\n00:15:42.469 --> 00:15:47.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The bottom bar, that's what\nI'm trying to say, of the status bar.\n\n306\n00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:50.573\nAgain, if you're in an Office product,\nthey all have a status bar.\n\n307\n00:15:50.573 --> 00:15:52.340\nAnd if you see, actually behind my head,\n\n308\n00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.182\nyou could see that we have some\ndifferent buttons down below here.\n\n309\n00:15:55.182 --> 00:15:58.285\nYou have your zoom,\nsince I'm in email right now,\n\n310\n00:15:58.285 --> 00:16:02.326\nif I start clicking the zoom button,\nit's going to be zooming in on\n\n311\n00:16:02.326 --> 00:16:06.245\nthe actual Reading pane,\nthat's the thing that's over here.\n\n312\n00:16:06.245 --> 00:16:07.084\nRemember, view.\n\n313\n00:16:07.084 --> 00:16:09.280\nSo I can turn that reading pane on and\noff.\n\n314\n00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.750\nBut the default view has\nthe reading pane on the right.\n\n315\n00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:17.550\nSo that zoom is going to be zooming in on\nthe actual message that I'm looking at.\n\n316\n00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:18.910\nIf I was in the calendar,\n\n317\n00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.620\nof course, the zoom's going to\nbe a little bit different there.\n\n318\n00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:26.040\nI actually don't have a zoom right on here\nbecause this particular layout doesn't\n\n319\n00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.650\nreally need to be zoomed in or out.\n\n320\n00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:33.650\nBut just know that that status bar down\nat the bottom, the different buttons or\n\n321\n00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.490\nzooms, it all depends on\nthe areas that you're in.\n\n322\n00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:40.250\nAnd it also gives me things like,\nlook, all my folders are up to date.\n\n323\n00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:44.170\nBecause really what we're talking about\nhere, with your mail, your calendar,\n\n324\n00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.270\nyour contacts, they are folders.\n\n325\n00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.800\nThink about a desk.\n\n326\n00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.530\nYou actually have a drawer and\nyou have a filing system.\n\n327\n00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.240\nAnd you have different folders of\ndifferent things that you need to do.\n\n328\n00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.780\nIt's the same thing here.\n\n329\n00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.720\nSo your inbox or your mail is a folder.\n\n330\n00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.970\nYour calendar is like a folder.\n\n331\n00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:03.910\nIt's like where Outlook is\nstoring that information.\n\n332\n00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.847\nSo that's why we actually\nhave a folder tab here and\n\n333\n00:17:06.847 --> 00:17:11.493\nyou have different things of like all of\nthe different folders, like that little\n\n334\n00:17:11.493 --> 00:17:15.616\ndot dot dot here, and it's gonna go\nthrough all the different things.\n\n335\n00:17:15.616 --> 00:17:20.287\nIt's just listing everything like in\na folder view because that's really what\n\n336\n00:17:20.287 --> 00:17:24.121\nthese things are even though we're\nreferring to them as Email and\n\n337\n00:17:24.121 --> 00:17:26.717\ncalendars and all those different things.\n\n338\n00:17:26.717 --> 00:17:31.817\nSo a few things that I want to to go back\ninto it's a little bit of customization\n\n339\n00:17:31.817 --> 00:17:36.605\nwithin our overall interface and\nwhat we're looking at right now we're\n\n340\n00:17:36.605 --> 00:17:40.939\ngoing to concentrate on the quick\naccess toolbar and the ribbon.\n\n341\n00:17:40.939 --> 00:17:43.122\nI'm going to come back\nover here to my mail,\n\n342\n00:17:43.122 --> 00:17:46.980\nI'm going to go back over to Home just to\nkind of give me like a starting point.\n\n343\n00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.880\nThe quick access toolbar\nis always going to stay on,\n\n344\n00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.690\nif you want to say, no matter what tab,\nwhat area you are in Outlook.\n\n345\n00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:58.460\nSo I could be in the contacts and\n\n346\n00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:02.880\nI could be in the view tab but anything\nup here, that's always going to stay.\n\n347\n00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.790\nSo if you had commonly used commands\nthat you're always going to\n\n348\n00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:12.650\nwant to get to but you didn't want to\nhave to jump all over into your areas,\n\n349\n00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.320\ninto your tabs on your ribbon.\n\n350\n00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.720\nYou could go ahead and add them right\nhere to the Quick Access toolbar.\n\n351\n00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.140\nSo on the very last part of\nthe Quick Access toolbar,\n\n352\n00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.560\nthere's a little droppy down.\n\n353\n00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.480\nThat's a technical term there, Ronnie.\n\n354\n00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.003\n&gt;&gt; I heard.\n\n355\n00:18:24.003 --> 00:18:27.451\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You know me,\nI like to make up things.\n\n356\n00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:30.074\nSo this customized Quick\nclick Access toolbar button,\n\n357\n00:18:30.074 --> 00:18:31.536\nI think that's its real name.\n\n358\n00:18:31.536 --> 00:18:32.093\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n359\n00:18:32.093 --> 00:18:32.976\n&gt;&gt; Is it?\n\n360\n00:18:32.976 --> 00:18:33.565\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n361\n00:18:33.565 --> 00:18:34.799\n&gt;&gt; Good, I used it correctly.\n\n362\n00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:38.888\nSo you could say that you could add things\nlike print cuz maybe you have to print out\n\n363\n00:18:38.888 --> 00:18:41.490\na lot of your emails cuz\nthat's what you need to do.\n\n364\n00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.650\nYou can add a print command\nhere I could add a reply,\n\n365\n00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.520\nso let's go ahead and start adding\nsome of them, I'll add a Print.\n\n366\n00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.970\nNow these are ones that are like the most\ncommonly used, or the ones like it things,\n\n367\n00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.572\nlike Office, no Outlook,\nwell I guess Outlook is Office.\n\n368\n00:18:55.572 --> 00:18:58.650\nThat [LAUGH] Outlooks wants\nyou to put on here, but\n\n369\n00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.240\nwhat if there's something that\nI want that's not on here?\n\n370\n00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.136\nYou can always go to\nthe More Commands down at the bottom.\n\n371\n00:19:05.136 --> 00:19:09.130\nWhen we're go into more commands\nyou're actually in the Outlook\n\n372\n00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:13.980\noptions that we had got to from\nthe file tab at the backstage view.\n\n373\n00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:18.630\nAnd we're in the Quick Access\ntoolbar section of our options.\n\n374\n00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.240\nSo, you could've got\nto it from either way.\n\n375\n00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.695\nSo, you could see that if I wanted\nto ask some other things over here,\n\n376\n00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:26.316\nI would have to find out\nlike where they are because,\n\n377\n00:19:26.316 --> 00:19:29.090\nnotice there's a lot of different tabs,\nright?\n\n378\n00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:32.360\nWell, you see there's a home on the mail,\nthere's a home on the calendar,\n\n379\n00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.920\nthere's a home on the task.\n\n380\n00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.150\nSo if there is a specific\ncommand that you want to add,\n\n381\n00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:41.310\nyou kinda need to know where it lives\non the ribbon before you start.\n\n382\n00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.340\nBut if you feel like, well,\nI don't remember what it is.\n\n383\n00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.454\nI just need to do the add new\ngroup meeting or do new meeting.\n\n384\n00:19:47.454 --> 00:19:48.950\nAnd I don't remember where that's at.\n\n385\n00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.610\nWell, you can always go\nto the All Commands, and\n\n386\n00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.350\nit's going to list everything\nin alphabetical order.\n\n387\n00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:58.730\nIt might take you awhile because there\nmight a lot of A's and things like that.\n\n388\n00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:02.390\nYou can go ahead and\nfind it in your All Commands,\n\n389\n00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:04.780\nbecause maybe I want to\ndo Add to Favorites.\n\n390\n00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.650\nI'm just randomly picking right now,\n\n391\n00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:08.270\nbecause I really [LAUGH] didn't\nfeel like scrolling anymore.\n\n392\n00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:11.730\nSo if I wanted to add this,\nI can do ahead and add that.\n\n393\n00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.760\nAnd All Categories that\nmight be a good one to add.\n\n394\n00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.450\nWe'll talk about what a category\nis at one point, and so\n\n395\n00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:21.670\nI can go ahead and start really filling\nup my Quick Access Toolbar to have\n\n396\n00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.020\nas many commands as I want them to have.\n\n397\n00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.850\nOne thing I would like to point out is\nthat, if you start adding a bunch of stuff\n\n398\n00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:33.780\nand gosh and I'd kind of, I really don't\nwant any of this things on here anymore.\n\n399\n00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:38.040\nYou do have an option to reset\nany of your customization.\n\n400\n00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:44.370\nAnd notice it says Reset Quick Access Only\nor All Customization because not only can\n\n401\n00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:48.880\nyou customize the Quick Access toolbar,\nyou can customize the ribbon as well.\n\n402\n00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.190\nYou can make, just like you're making a,\nsorry, I'm crossing streams right now.\n\n403\n00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.640\nJust like right now how you're adding\na bunch of commands on your quick access\n\n404\n00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.810\ntoolbar for\nyou to be able to quickly access.\n\n405\n00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:04.820\nYou could make your own\ntab on the ribbon and\n\n406\n00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.980\nstart adding all of your\nown commands there.\n\n407\n00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.410\nSo it really just depends on\ndo you want it on a toolbar?\n\n408\n00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:10.760\nOr do you want it in the ribbon?\n\n409\n00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.786\nIt's really up to you, it's your option\nfor how much you wanna customized.\n\n410\n00:21:13.786 --> 00:21:17.700\nBut that's why it's giving you this\ntwo choices of just the toolbar,\n\n411\n00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.679\nall customization, that would include,\nany of your ribbon options or\n\n412\n00:21:21.679 --> 00:21:24.010\nanything that you made there.\n\n413\n00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:25.610\nWe'll jump back to that in just a second.\n\n414\n00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:28.370\nBut I just wanted to show you really\nquickly the end result of all this\n\n415\n00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:29.680\ncustomization.\n\n416\n00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.070\nYou can see that now, all of our\ndifferent commands are right here so\n\n417\n00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:37.110\nwe can be able to access it regardless\nof what tab we are on on the ribbon.\n\n418\n00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:42.210\nOne other thing, the Quick Access toolbar,\nyou could always show below the ribbon.\n\n419\n00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.164\nIt all depends on if you want\nit all the way at the top or\n\n420\n00:21:44.164 --> 00:21:45.374\ndo you want it below the ribbon.\n\n421\n00:21:45.374 --> 00:21:49.275\nAnd notice that all of\nyour little buttons come,\n\n422\n00:21:49.275 --> 00:21:54.710\nI kinda like it below cuz it's less\nroom to travel if you want to say.\n\n423\n00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:55.850\nSo, it's kind of easier to get to,\n\n424\n00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:59.750\nit's really up to you how\nyou want to configure that.\n\n425\n00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:03.690\nLet's talk about really quickly about\ndoing that ribbon customization,\n\n426\n00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:06.540\nbecause I wanted to make my own tab.\n\n427\n00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.822\nI'm gonna go a different way,\nthan we were just there,\n\n428\n00:22:08.822 --> 00:22:10.196\nwe're gonna go over to the file.\n\n429\n00:22:10.196 --> 00:22:14.990\nWe're gonna go to options, and then\nwe're going to go to customize ribbon,\n\n430\n00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:19.860\nand you can see here, this is where\nI can start customizing my ribbon.\n\n431\n00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:20.995\nNow before you start doing that,\n\n432\n00:22:20.995 --> 00:22:23.220\nyou're going to have to\none: make your own ribbon.\n\n433\n00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.250\nYou are going to have to add a ribbon.\n\n434\n00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:29.220\nAnd before you can add any commands you\nare going to have to add a new group.\n\n435\n00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.430\nWell what is a group?\n\n436\n00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.520\nWhat are you talking about group?\n\n437\n00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.610\nThis is what I mean.\n\n438\n00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:39.480\nFor example, here I am in the contacts,\nI am in the view tab The Arrangement,\n\n439\n00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.160\nthat is the group name,\nthe Layout, that is a group name.\n\n440\n00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:47.690\nIf I go back over to Home, New, Delete,\nCommunicate, those are group names.\n\n441\n00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:51.600\nSo you always have to have the ribbon and\nthen you have that at least one group,\n\n442\n00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.170\nif you don't make a group, it won't let\nyou, and actually it will warn you.\n\n443\n00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.170\nIt will say no, you gotta do this first.\n\n444\n00:22:56.170 --> 00:23:02.330\nSo let's go back over to File Options,\nCustomize Ribbon.\n\n445\n00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.140\nRight over here, how am I going\nto make a new tab on the ribbon?\n\n446\n00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.234\nYou click New Tab and\nthen I go ahead and click New Tab.\n\n447\n00:23:09.234 --> 00:23:12.678\nAnd then you can notice\nthat I have my new tab, but\n\n448\n00:23:12.678 --> 00:23:15.700\nthat's not a very good name is it?\n\n449\n00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.550\nSo if you click on it, you have options\ndown here to then well, Rename.\n\n450\n00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:21.910\nBecause maybe I want to name this Von's,\n\n451\n00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:25.060\nwell let's not capitalize the o,\nVon's Stuff.\n\n452\n00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.280\nThere we go.\n\n453\n00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:28.780\nPerfect.\n\n454\n00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:32.720\nSo, we're going to go ahead and\nclick okay, and\n\n455\n00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.950\nthen you can see that's the name.\n\n456\n00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.220\nI have a group.\n\n457\n00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:41.190\nNow you have to be selected here,\nbefore you can start adding your commands.\n\n458\n00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.790\nRemember I said you have to have a group,\nyou don't have to make a group but\n\n459\n00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.070\nyou just have to make\nsure that you're here.\n\n460\n00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:51.070\nCuz watch, if I click here and I say I\nwanna go ahead and add a new email, and\n\n461\n00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:55.120\nI click add, it's gonna say nope, you have\nto be in the group before you can add it.\n\n462\n00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.434\nOkay thank you for letting me know.\n\n463\n00:23:56.434 --> 00:24:00.972\nLet me come over here to group and\nI'll click on new email and now I'll add.\n\n464\n00:24:00.972 --> 00:24:04.420\nAnd then I can start adding all sorts of\ncommands and I'm just gonna Honestly,\n\n465\n00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:08.147\nI don't even know what I'm clicking on\nanymore, I'm just adding certain things.\n\n466\n00:24:08.147 --> 00:24:12.673\nAnd if you wanted to give your group\na different name, you can click on that\n\n467\n00:24:12.673 --> 00:24:17.860\ngroup and you can rename and you can say\nstuff cuz I don't know what else to say.\n\n468\n00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.540\nAnd you can keep on going, notice you\ncan add more groups in your ribbon.\n\n469\n00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.450\nYou can start adding all\nthe different commands that you\n\n470\n00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:28.870\nmight have that you want to go ahead and\nput in all one place and your ribbons.\n\n471\n00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:30.630\nAnd that you could add some more things.\n\n472\n00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:36.100\nI'm just gonna, I don't even know, let's\ngrab this one and we'll grab this one.\n\n473\n00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.690\nPerfect, okay.\n\n474\n00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:39.970\nAnd then I can go ahead and click OK.\n\n475\n00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:44.940\nNotice that right now there's my Vonne\nstuff, and I can see it right there.\n\n476\n00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.476\nIt's always going to be here,\n\n477\n00:24:47.476 --> 00:24:52.947\nas a tab no matter what area I am\nin in Outlook, it's gonna be a tab.\n\n478\n00:24:52.947 --> 00:24:57.087\nAnd I could always move it over back\nin that customization as like up and\n\n479\n00:24:57.087 --> 00:25:01.480\ndown buttons or if you want it to go\nbefore Home instead of after Home.\n\n480\n00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.560\nThat's just where I was.\n\n481\n00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.850\nAnd so you can see that I have\nall the different commands and\n\n482\n00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:09.410\nyou can really start\ncustomizing your area.\n\n483\n00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.680\nJust really quickly gonna\ngo back over there to\n\n484\n00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.860\nthe customized ribbon to see right here,\nwhere it says the Vonne stuff.\n\n485\n00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.563\nThe up and down arrows, that's what\nI wanted to show, the bumpy arrows,\n\n486\n00:25:20.563 --> 00:25:21.354\nas I call them.\n\n487\n00:25:21.354 --> 00:25:24.989\nWhere you can bump it all the way\nup to be in front of everything.\n\n488\n00:25:24.989 --> 00:25:27.770\nSo, my tab will be first in all of them.\n\n489\n00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:32.510\nAnd of course, you could always\nreset this if you wanted to later.\n\n490\n00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:37.940\nAnd that's where you can really kind of\nstart making your interface your own and\n\n491\n00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.510\nhow you want it to live, if you wanna say.\n\n492\n00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.400\nCuz this is how I want everything to work.\n\n493\n00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.986\nThere's one last thing that\nI wanted to point out.\n\n494\n00:25:46.986 --> 00:25:51.697\nAnd I remember the first time that I\ninstalled this, cuz it's been a while.\n\n495\n00:25:51.697 --> 00:25:54.878\nI was working on 2013 for\nthe longest time.\n\n496\n00:25:54.878 --> 00:25:56.920\nAnd I didn't have this version.\n\n497\n00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.500\nI didn't have it on a new laptop.\n\n498\n00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.070\nI didn't have an Office 365 account,\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n499\n00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.950\nAnd this thing over here on the right,\nokay,\n\n500\n00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:07.810\nsome of it's a little behind my head but\nyou see this little guy right over here?\n\n501\n00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.920\nThis bar and\nI didn't even know what it was called.\n\n502\n00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.621\nI'm like, I'm looking for it,\nI'm looking in the View, I'm like,\n\n503\n00:26:14.621 --> 00:26:16.140\nit's not turning off.\n\n504\n00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:16.910\nWhy won't it go?\n\n505\n00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:21.697\nAnd it's there depending on whether I'm in\nCalendar or I'm in Mail and I'm just like,\n\n506\n00:26:21.697 --> 00:26:24.970\nI didn't even know what it's\ncalled to get rid of it.\n\n507\n00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:27.438\nOkay, because I'm like,\nI don't really want that.\n\n508\n00:26:27.438 --> 00:26:30.753\nIt can be handy, it's kind of almost\nlike my Quick Access over but\n\n509\n00:26:30.753 --> 00:26:32.810\nI have too many of them.\n\n510\n00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:37.120\nThat thing is called, well,\nI don't even know what it's called.\n\n511\n00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.220\nBut it's called the Touch Mouse Mode,\nokay?\n\n512\n00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:44.560\nSo this is really more for\nif you're using touchscreen monitors.\n\n513\n00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.292\nBecause, of course,\nwith the new Windows operating systems and\n\n514\n00:26:47.292 --> 00:26:49.637\nall the new computers,\nit's all about touchscreens.\n\n515\n00:26:49.637 --> 00:26:52.495\nAnd I read an article about\nthat that's why they made them.\n\n516\n00:26:52.495 --> 00:26:55.765\nAnd I'm like, well, that makes sense but\nI don't want it, so\n\n517\n00:26:55.765 --> 00:26:57.500\nit told me how to turn it off.\n\n518\n00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:01.366\nSo I'm gonna tell you, from the Quick\nAccess toolbar, now mine's down below\n\n519\n00:27:01.366 --> 00:27:04.882\nbecause remember I had shown my\nQuick Access toolbar below my ribbon for\n\n520\n00:27:04.882 --> 00:27:05.480\nright now.\n\n521\n00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:10.480\nIf I click on that,\nit's right there, Touch Mouse Mod.\n\n522\n00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:13.544\nIf I click on that button, it's just\nadding that button on the Quick Access\n\n523\n00:27:13.544 --> 00:27:16.188\ntoolbar, because, well,\nthat didn't do anything, I know.\n\n524\n00:27:16.188 --> 00:27:20.095\nBecause now, you can click on\nthe button and you drop down and\n\n525\n00:27:20.095 --> 00:27:25.224\nyou can see that it's going to give me\nmore options here of if I'm doing a mouse,\n\n526\n00:27:25.224 --> 00:27:29.680\ncuz I'm on a computer with mouse,\nI don't have touch screen.\n\n527\n00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.490\nSo if I click here,\nnotice how it takes that away and\n\n528\n00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:37.270\neverything actually\ncondenses a little bit more.\n\n529\n00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.028\nDi you see that?\n\n530\n00:27:38.028 --> 00:27:41.790\nAll of these options here, let me go\nback on that and go back over to Touch.\n\n531\n00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:45.651\nDid you see how much more space\nis available on the ribbon now?\n\n532\n00:27:45.651 --> 00:27:47.988\nAll the commands are spaced out\na little bit more, cuz think about,\n\n533\n00:27:47.988 --> 00:27:51.033\ncuz I know sometimes you touch things and\nit's like, wait, no, that's the wrong.\n\n534\n00:27:51.033 --> 00:27:54.549\nEspecially my interface on my car,\nthe touch screen is so off, I'm like I'm\n\n535\n00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:58.354\nclicking on one button and it's clicking\nsomething over here and I'm like, arg.\n\n536\n00:27:58.354 --> 00:28:02.805\nSo it's just the different modes and not\nonly just like this bar over on the right\n\n537\n00:28:02.805 --> 00:28:07.520\nhand side, but how much real estate, how\nmuch space you have around the commands.\n\n538\n00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.470\nSo if you have a touch screen, that\nmight be one that you would wanna have.\n\n539\n00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:15.630\nBut if you are like me, I'm a mouse\nperson, I need to have my mouse.\n\n540\n00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:17.300\nSo you can switch it over here to mouse.\n\n541\n00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.970\nIt takes that little thing over there\non the right hand side away and\n\n542\n00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:24.750\nyou get a lot more commands on\nyour ribbon that you can see.\n\n543\n00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.140\nAnd I think it's just a little bit easier.\n\n544\n00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:29.200\nSo I wanted to throw that out to you\nbecause it bothered me when I first did my\n\n545\n00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.250\ninstallation.\n\n546\n00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:35.369\nSo it might bother you as well, so that's\nmy little tip of the day for this episode.\n\n547\n00:28:35.369 --> 00:28:39.108\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne, well, thank you for\nhelping us to learn a little bit more\n\n548\n00:28:39.108 --> 00:28:43.269\nabout the interface before we really dive\ninto making sure that we can get Office to\n\n549\n00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:47.170\nwork the way that we want to or\nOutlook to work the way that we want to.\n\n550\n00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:51.600\nHaving a brief and a beginning\nunderstanding of where the things are and\n\n551\n00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.990\nsome of the terminology\nin which Vonne used,\n\n552\n00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:56.710\nis gonna help us especially\nthroughout the entire show.\n\n553\n00:28:56.710 --> 00:29:00.230\nSo thank you for helping us there too and\nthank you also for joining us.\n\n554\n00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:03.970\nBut that's a great place for\nus to also wrap up right here too.\n\n555\n00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:06.930\nFor OffficeProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong,\n\n556\n00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:07.980\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n557\n00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.210\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Outlook 2016 shows.\n\n558\n00:29:12.210 -->

00:00:12.680\nYou're watching the Outlook 2016 show.\n\n4\n00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.820\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today,\nwe're gonna be learning about\n\n5\n00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.500\nthe email interface and Vonne Smith's\ngoing to help guide us through that.\n\n6\n00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.660\nVonne, welcome back to our studios.\n\n7\n00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.867\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:26.447\nI'm excited to be here, cuz we've left\noff in our previous episode we were\n\n9\n00:00:26.447 --> 00:00:31.411\ntalking about the Outlook interface,\nabout the whole program in its entirety.\n\n10\n00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:36.300\nAnd now we're gonna be focusing\ndirectly in the email area of Outlook.\n\n11\n00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.075\nSo we're gonna get familiar\nwith the different folders,\n\n12\n00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:42.018\ntalk about what they are,\nidentify the different views, and\n\n13\n00:00:42.018 --> 00:00:45.630\nall the different options you can have for\nlooking at what you're seeing.\n\n14\n00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.160\n[LAUGH] For lack of a better term.\n\n15\n00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.162\nAnd then that way you get a better\nidea of where we're going,\n\n16\n00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:55.889\nso in our future episodes we'll be\nable to just identify those in a bit.\n\n17\n00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:58.560\nI know what that is because I\nwatched the email interface episode.\n\n18\n00:00:59.582 --> 00:01:04.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Vonne that really does make sense\nfor us to have a solid foundation here.\n\n19\n00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.940\nEmail is probably what we spend\nthe majority of the time on anyways.\n\n20\n00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.580\nSo it's good for\nus to get a good solid grounding on\n\n21\n00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.020\nall the different things that\nwe'll end up seeing here.\n\n22\n00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.486\nBecause it's more than just sending and\nreceiving emails,\n\n23\n00:01:15.486 --> 00:01:16.897\nthere's a lot more that we can do.\n\n24\n00:01:16.897 --> 00:01:18.347\nSo Vonne where are we gonna begin?\n\n25\n00:01:18.347 --> 00:01:21.897\n&gt;&gt; Alright, well why don't we go ahead and\njump down to my computer and\n\n26\n00:01:21.897 --> 00:01:24.591\nI have Outlook already\nopened up on this computer.\n\n27\n00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:29.015\nAnd I set some things up before this\nepisode to be able to show you all\n\n28\n00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:32.180\nthe different pieces and\nareas within email.\n\n29\n00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.530\nSo let's start over on\nthe left hand side and\n\n30\n00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.935\nthis area right over here,\nwe identified as the folder pane,\n\n31\n00:01:38.935 --> 00:01:43.075\nbecause everything that we're working\nwith in Outlook it it really is a folder.\n\n32\n00:01:43.075 --> 00:01:47.169\nLike we have our inbox is a folder,\nour outbox is a folder.\n\n33\n00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:51.809\nThe calendar really is a folder as well,\neven though we're calling it an area or\n\n34\n00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:53.553\ndifferent piece of Outlook.\n\n35\n00:01:53.553 --> 00:01:58.376\nBut the way Outlook sees it, they're all\nfolders within the Outlook filing cabinet,\n\n36\n00:01:58.376 --> 00:01:59.374\nif you would say.\n\n37\n00:01:59.374 --> 00:02:02.790\nSo in this main section of the email\ninterface over on the right,\n\n38\n00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.093\nthat would be the other right, that would\nbe the left, [LAUGH] the left hand side,\n\n39\n00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.127\nwe have our inbox.\n\n40\n00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:10.410\nSo what is the inbox?\n\n41\n00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.100\nKind of says it itself.\n\n42\n00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.080\nIt's the place where all\nyour mail comes into.\n\n43\n00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.650\nSo that's what we've got right over here.\n\n44\n00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.510\nAnd if I click on it\non the left hand side,\n\n45\n00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.470\nnothing's really gonna change right now.\n\n46\n00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.536\nBecause I'm already in\nthe inbox by default.\n\n47\n00:02:24.536 --> 00:02:26.402\nSo what is the drafts folder?\n\n48\n00:02:26.402 --> 00:02:30.713\nThe drafts is kind of, if you think\nabout if I'm drafting a letter or\n\n49\n00:02:30.713 --> 00:02:33.890\nI'm creating a draft\nbefore my final paper.\n\n50\n00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.490\nIt's a place where you kind of won't\nlet things hang out for a little bit.\n\n51\n00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.270\nAnd kind of let it breed if you wanna say.\n\n52\n00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.930\nSo place where if you saved any mail,\nlike if you are starting a new message.\n\n53\n00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.190\nAnd you click the save button,\n\n54\n00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.450\nit's automatically gonna\ngo into your drafts folder.\n\n55\n00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.060\nAnd so that's where your\nsaved messages will hang out.\n\n56\n00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.803\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and click on it,\nand you can see once I single click on\n\n57\n00:02:55.803 --> 00:02:59.668\nthe left-hand side on the drafts folder,\nit takes me in to the drafts area and\n\n58\n00:02:59.668 --> 00:03:02.724\nshows me all the different things\nthat are in that right now.\n\n59\n00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:06.422\nSo this area right here in\nthe main middle section is\n\n60\n00:03:06.422 --> 00:03:11.324\ngoing to be viewing whatever folder\nthat you are in at that time, and\n\n61\n00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:15.288\nI had put one in here that I\nstarted in an email to Lance.\n\n62\n00:03:15.288 --> 00:03:19.554\nAnd I was going to save it for later, and\nyou can see I actually gave it a subject\n\n63\n00:03:19.554 --> 00:03:23.770\nline, and it says, saving for later,\ncuz I'm not ready to send it.\n\n64\n00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.660\nSo I'm letting it hangout in the drafts.\n\n65\n00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.771\nYou can also see over on the left-hand\nside the little numbers to the right\n\n66\n00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:31.372\nof each of the folder names.\n\n67\n00:03:31.372 --> 00:03:34.668\nAnd the inbox I have\na bold number 2 in there.\n\n68\n00:03:34.668 --> 00:03:38.971\nIn the drafts folder I have a 1 in\nthose little square brackets, and\n\n69\n00:03:38.971 --> 00:03:42.143\nthat's just indicating\nthe amount of drafts, or\n\n70\n00:03:42.143 --> 00:03:46.730\namount of emails that I have in\nthe drafts folder waiting for me.\n\n71\n00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.430\nAnd the two means that I have\ntwo unread messages in my inbox.\n\n72\n00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.610\nNow once I go ahead and\nread those messages,\n\n73\n00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.870\nthat number two is gonna go to zero.\n\n74\n00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.916\nBut that's always the number\nthat you look at is like,\n\n75\n00:03:57.916 --> 00:03:59.125\nhow many new e-mails do I have.\n\n76\n00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:04.317\nAnd I can remember coming back from\na vacation, or a weekend, and that's just\n\n77\n00:04:04.317 --> 00:04:09.444\na really large number, and you just\nkind of go, okay, let's jump right in.\n\n78\n00:04:09.444 --> 00:04:11.460\n[LAUGH] And get cracking on that.\n\n79\n00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.930\nSo that's what the numbers\nmean over there.\n\n80\n00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.870\nSo let's go ahead and keep navigating\nthrough our different folders.\n\n81\n00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.140\nThe sent Items.\n\n82\n00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.920\nWhat do you think that means, Ronnie?\n\n83\n00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.970\n&gt;&gt; I'm assuming that it means that it's\nemails that we actually have sent.\n\n84\n00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:25.750\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes.\n\n85\n00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.450\nIt's items that we have sent.\n\n86\n00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.100\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n87\n00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.120\nthose are the different ones that\nI have sent to somebody else.\n\n88\n00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.490\nI don't really know how many other\nways I can really explain that,\n\n89\n00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.430\nexcept it's the sent items.\n\n90\n00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.710\nLet's keep on moving down.\n\n91\n00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.560\nDeleted, well,\nthat's pretty self-explanatory as well.\n\n92\n00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.872\nThis is your trashcan.\n\n93\n00:04:41.872 --> 00:04:44.316\nIt's the Items that you have said,\nI don't want that email.\n\n94\n00:04:44.316 --> 00:04:46.549\nCuz maybe coming back\nafter that vacation and\n\n95\n00:04:46.549 --> 00:04:50.483\nyou've got a bunch of emails from\nsomebody that's just talking about, well,\n\n96\n00:04:50.483 --> 00:04:52.671\nthe pizza that they had for\nlunch on Friday.\n\n97\n00:04:52.671 --> 00:04:55.075\nIt's like, well I wasn't here on Friday so\nI don't really mind.\n\n98\n00:04:55.075 --> 00:04:56.850\nBut I don't really want\nto hear about this.\n\n99\n00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.940\nSo you just hit the delete key and\nit just goes away and\n\n100\n00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.340\nit goes into your deleted items.\n\n101\n00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.470\nNow just because you go ahead and\n\n102\n00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.530\ndelete a message doesn't mean\nthat they permanently go away.\n\n103\n00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.240\nIt is like our recycle bin on our desktop\nor in our operating system is that\n\n104\n00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.830\nyou put something in the trash, but that\ndoesn't mean that you cannot fish that\n\n105\n00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.350\nthing out of the trash, I know we've all\ndone that before, so the same thing here.\n\n106\n00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.710\nIf you now delete your trash, or\n\n107\n00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.950\nyou go ahead and empty your deleted items,\nwell then it's permanently gone.\n\n108\n00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.090\nSo they just go ahead and\nhang out in the trash bin, or\n\n109\n00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.650\nthe deleted items until\nyou're ready to do that.\n\n110\n00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.160\nAnd the rest I'm going down.\n\n111\n00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.230\nWe have our archive.\n\n112\n00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.920\nWe're gonna be showing all about\nthe different archives and\n\n113\n00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.260\nlike the things that are saved.\n\n114\n00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.450\nSo if think about the word\narchive in general,\n\n115\n00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.560\nit's just the ones that's kinda hanging\nout and being archived for safe keeping.\n\n116\n00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.390\nAnd right now it really actually is\nsomething that I have a test from Joey,\n\n117\n00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.120\nand I had set that to go ahead and\ngo into the archives folder.\n\n118\n00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.060\nI wanted to have something in there.\n\n119\n00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.840\nWe don't really have any\nconversation histories,\n\n120\n00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.140\nbecause we don't have any\nconversations for one thing.\n\n121\n00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.570\nWe also don't have Skype setup.\n\n122\n00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.444\nSo we don't have anything\ngoing on in here.\n\n123\n00:06:04.444 --> 00:06:08.595\nThe junk mail, we'll talk a lot about our\njunk mail in a specific episode about what\n\n124\n00:06:08.595 --> 00:06:11.164\ndoes it mean to actually\nget things into junk mail?\n\n125\n00:06:11.164 --> 00:06:14.010\nHow do I have it not\ngo into the junk mail?\n\n126\n00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.815\nMaybe I wanna send something to\nthe junk mail, so I stop looking at it.\n\n127\n00:06:17.815 --> 00:06:21.052\nSo its just another place that\nyour mail goes to automatically.\n\n128\n00:06:21.052 --> 00:06:25.983\nBut these are automatic settings that\nOutlook puts on what it thinks is junk and\n\n129\n00:06:25.983 --> 00:06:28.460\nwhat it doesn't think is junk.\n\n130\n00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.250\nAnd that something that you at\na certain level don't really control.\n\n131\n00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.660\nBut now you can control what\nhappens if it goes in there and\n\n132\n00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.170\nthat's something we'll go ahead and\nexplore in a later episode.\n\n133\n00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.220\nNow your outbox is well, the outbox.\n\n134\n00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.900\nSometimes, and I've had things hang out in\nthere, because maybe earlier this morning,\n\n135\n00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.740\nmy connection to this particular virtual\nmachine It just stopped working,\n\n136\n00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.460\nit said that Outlook was disconnected.\n\n137\n00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.730\nI'm like well I'm connected to\nthe Internet and everything.\n\n138\n00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.430\nI had to do the good old\nrestart your computer and\n\n139\n00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.590\nguess what happened, everything was fixed.\n\n140\n00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:01.869\nWhen in doubt, restart.\n\n141\n00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:06.413\nSo I had emails that I had composed and\nI had to send,\n\n142\n00:07:06.413 --> 00:07:10.766\nI said send it out, but\nthere was no connection.\n\n143\n00:07:10.766 --> 00:07:12.823\nSo I had something in the outbox.\n\n144\n00:07:12.823 --> 00:07:16.712\nAnd so if you're ever working on like,\nokay I don't want to be connected to\n\n145\n00:07:16.712 --> 00:07:20.499\nthe server for any reason,\nbecause maybe you don't have that ability.\n\n146\n00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:23.615\nBut you still have outlook and you wanna\ngo ahead and get everything ready, because\n\n147\n00:07:23.615 --> 00:07:26.732\nmaybe you're sitting in the airport or\nsomething and you don't have connection,\n\n148\n00:07:26.732 --> 00:07:29.130\nbecause you don't want to get on WiFi or\nwhat have you.\n\n149\n00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.930\nAnd so you can go ahead and\nsend that, put them in the Outbox.\n\n150\n00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.930\nWhen you get back to the office or\nwherever you will have, where Outlook can\n\n151\n00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.850\nconnect back to your server, then it\nwill go ahead and send it back out.\n\n152\n00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.550\nSo that's what the outback means.\n\n153\n00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.075\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Vonne, also on the Outback,\n\n154\n00:07:44.075 --> 00:07:47.177\nif you choose to schedule\na message to go out.\n\n155\n00:07:47.177 --> 00:07:49.965\nSo if Vonne is going on vacation,\nshe may even go ahead and\n\n156\n00:07:49.965 --> 00:07:53.974\nsend to her department something that was\nsupposed to be due, let's say Monday,\n\n157\n00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:55.388\nbut she's leaving Friday.\n\n158\n00:07:55.388 --> 00:07:59.102\nShe doesn't wanna send it out Friday,\ncuz it's gonna be a long list of tasks and\n\n159\n00:07:59.102 --> 00:08:00.444\npeople are gonna regret it.\n\n160\n00:08:00.444 --> 00:08:04.673\nShe can actually wait until Monday\nmorning, but instead of her trying to try\n\n161\n00:08:04.673 --> 00:08:09.380\nand check back in during vacation, she can\nschedule it and it just sits in her inbox.\n\n162\n00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.354\nAnd when it sits there,\n\n163\n00:08:10.354 --> 00:08:13.280\nit will just sit there until\nthe time it is scheduled to go out.\n\n164\n00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.786\nSo it really is a holding place and\nit's gonna be temporary,\n\n165\n00:08:16.786 --> 00:08:19.550\nsometimes you will get\nthose messages back up.\n\n166\n00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.920\nBut then when it sends out, it's gonna\nempty itself which is kind of neat.\n\n167\n00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.590\nYeah, and I think you said Inbox,\nI kno you meant Outbox.\n\n168\n00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.020\nBut just to clarify, they were like wait,\nare we talking about in or out?\n\n169\n00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:29.930\nYes, we're talking about out.\n\n170\n00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:30.800\nBut that's a great point.\n\n171\n00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.390\nAnd we are gonna have an entire episode\n\n172\n00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:38.140\non some advanced email features of how you\ncan, well, wait until later to send that.\n\n173\n00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.790\nLike you send it after\nyou leave the office,\n\n174\n00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:43.990\nso nobody can come knocking on your door\nand be like, hey what's going on here?\n\n175\n00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.650\nLike, I don't know, I'm not here.\n\n176\n00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.860\n[LAUGH] So it's nice to be able to\nhave those different options of\n\n177\n00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.150\nwhen your email gets sent rather\nthan just click it and it goes.\n\n178\n00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.070\nSo great point.\n\n179\n00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.830\nThanks for bringing that up there, Ronnie.\n\n180\n00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:55.368\nAll right.\nAnd so\n\n181\n00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:59.467\nyou can see back down in here that pretty\nmuch completes our left-hand navigation in\n\n182\n00:08:59.467 --> 00:09:00.600\nour folder pane.\n\n183\n00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.493\nWe do have an RSS feed.\n\n184\n00:09:02.493 --> 00:09:03.838\nIs it real simple syndication?\n\n185\n00:09:03.838 --> 00:09:04.573\n&gt;&gt; Real simple syndication.\n\n186\n00:09:04.573 --> 00:09:05.210\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n187\n00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.661\nI was hoping I remembered that acronym.\n\n188\n00:09:07.661 --> 00:09:10.760\nBecause as soon as I started,\nI'm like I hope this is what it means.\n\n189\n00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.819\nBut luckily Ronnie,\nyou're here with me and\n\n190\n00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:15.432\nI know that you're a walking\nencyclopedia of acronyms.\n\n191\n00:09:15.432 --> 00:09:16.551\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n192\n00:09:16.551 --> 00:09:17.770\n&gt;&gt; I know a lot of them.\n\n193\n00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.310\n&gt;&gt; You do, you definitely do.\n\n194\n00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.760\nAnd we'll talk about searching\nin other episodes as well.\n\n195\n00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.200\nIn this particular set up,\nI am part of what's known as a group.\n\n196\n00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.110\nNow you might not see groups hanging\nout there, because this depends,\n\n197\n00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.220\nwhat is a group?\n\n198\n00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:38.320\nWell think about a group as in\ngeneral like a group of friends, and\n\n199\n00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.430\nyou kind of have your closed circuit and\nthose you talk to each other, but\n\n200\n00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.825\nmaybe not to everybody else.\n\n201\n00:09:43.825 --> 00:09:45.907\nWell this is sounding like\na middle school episode right now.\n\n202\n00:09:45.907 --> 00:09:47.392\nSo [LAUGH].\n\n203\n00:09:47.392 --> 00:09:49.315\n&gt;&gt; I think it is, I think the term\nyou're looking for is squad.\n\n204\n00:09:49.315 --> 00:09:50.562\nI think that's what I understand.\n\n205\n00:09:50.562 --> 00:09:52.631\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, the cool cliques.\n\n206\n00:09:52.631 --> 00:09:54.200\nYeah I was never a part of one of those.\n\n207\n00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.350\nBut at least in my own\nmind I thought I was cool.\n\n208\n00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:58.420\nAnyways, I digress.\n\n209\n00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.875\nLet's not go back to middle school,\nI'm starting to have flashbacks.\n\n210\n00:10:00.875 --> 00:10:04.970\n[LAUGH] So but if you think about it,\nits a closed group.\n\n211\n00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.420\nLike we go ahead and\ninteract with each other.\n\n212\n00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:11.498\nThat maybe we're on let's say we're on,\nlike a marketing team.\n\n213\n00:10:11.498 --> 00:10:16.650\nAnd there's other people that we talk to\nall the time, but there is a set number of\n\n214\n00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.700\npeople that we need to interact, that we\ncan like share calendars and contacts, and\n\n215\n00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.510\nthings that well,\nlike you would do in any type of group.\n\n216\n00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.860\nI also think about like Facebook groups.\n\n217\n00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:32.240\nI'm a part of a Facebook group that\nfollows a certain NHL hockey team.\n\n218\n00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.800\nAnd we talk about the hockey team.\n\n219\n00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.030\nBut it's a closed group,\nit's not a public group.\n\n220\n00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.480\nYou have to be invited or asked in, and\n\n221\n00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.755\nI was luckily enough to have\na friend that let me in.\n\n222\n00:10:40.755 --> 00:10:45.600\n[LAUGH] So now I get to get all\nthe different updates on my favorite team.\n\n223\n00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.350\n&gt;&gt; The advantage of using groups,\nespecially for the email is simple.\n\n224\n00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.890\nIf Vonne has let's say 25 people in her\ngroup and she goes, you know something?\n\n225\n00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:57.000\nI really need to make sure\nthat everybody sees this.\n\n226\n00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.550\nWell it's likely at some point,\nespecially at let's Friday at 4:55,\n\n227\n00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:05.490\nVonne's trying to get out of there to\nhit the hockey game later that evening.\n\n228\n00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:10.410\nSo she, of course, is able to send\nit let's say to 23 out of 25 people,\n\n229\n00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.070\nbecause that's all\nthe emails she can remember.\n\n230\n00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:17.655\nThose two others, right, it might be that\nthey feel a little bit left out now that\n\n231\n00:11:17.655 --> 00:11:19.788\nVonne forgot them in that list.\n\n232\n00:11:19.788 --> 00:11:23.300\nWell instead Vonne could of actually\nhad a group created for her, or\n\n233\n00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.080\nshe might be able to create her own group.\n\n234\n00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.620\nSay here's everybody on my team,\nlet me go ahead and put them in there.\n\n235\n00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.170\nAnd Vonne, all she has to do is\nsend that to one email address and\n\n236\n00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.960\nthat automatically distributes\nit to the entire group\n\n237\n00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.740\nwithout Vonne ever having to worry\nif she forgot anyone in that group.\n\n238\n00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:42.190\nSo it really does make it easy to send\nout a mass communication that we need,\n\n239\n00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:45.710\nand we normally call that something\nlike a distribution list as well.\n\n240\n00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:49.355\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was going to say,\nif you're somewhat familiar with Outlook,\n\n241\n00:11:49.355 --> 00:11:51.380\nthat's what I always was reminded of.\n\n242\n00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.693\nAnd I actually asked you about this, well\nlike it's the same as a distribution list,\n\n243\n00:11:54.693 --> 00:11:56.590\nright, where you create\nwithin your contacts.\n\n244\n00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.990\nNow we're not in the contacts area of\nthis show just yet, but when we get into\n\n245\n00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:05.250\ncontacts we can make a distribution list\nto where I can have all of the hosts.\n\n246\n00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:09.851\nI know back in the university, I would do\nall of the instructors for summer 2016.\n\n247\n00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:13.292\nAnd I would put them all in a group,\nand so when I wanted to email them all,\n\n248\n00:12:13.292 --> 00:12:16.410\nI said, go ahead and use\nthe distribution list to email them all.\n\n249\n00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.391\nAnd that's where I know\nthat I didn't miss anybody,\n\n250\n00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:23.910\nbut with groups it's like a distribution\nlist but with extended capabilities.\n\n251\n00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.030\nYou could have your own calendar.\n\n252\n00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.862\nSo you could have your own kind of chain.\n\n253\n00:12:27.862 --> 00:12:30.921\nAnd I know that we have here at\nITPRO.TV we have like a host,\n\n254\n00:12:30.921 --> 00:12:33.980\nit's like hosts at something something,\nsomething, and\n\n255\n00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.665\nthat means that all of us are added on\nthere and so we go ahead and do that.\n\n256\n00:12:37.665 --> 00:12:43.864\nBut groups are something that needs to\nbe established by your administration.\n\n257\n00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:49.763\nSo if you're in a large organization that\nis using Office 365 as your exchange.\n\n258\n00:12:49.763 --> 00:12:53.641\nNow again I put in quotes there, because\nexchange we talked about in that other\n\n259\n00:12:53.641 --> 00:12:57.960\nepisode of where it's kind of a closed\nsystem that somebody builds for you.\n\n260\n00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.840\nIt's the same idea here of they can\ncreate groups, or you're able to\n\n261\n00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:08.440\ncreate groups within that Office 365\nbusiness level setup, if you wanna say.\n\n262\n00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.540\nIf you're just a normal user or\n\n263\n00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.225\nsomebody that's not within a large\norganization, you like I don't see groups,\n\n264\n00:13:14.225 --> 00:13:17.730\nyou're not supposed to, so\ndon't feel left out of the group.\n\n265\n00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:23.130\nOkay, anyway that's pretty much everything\nthat's going on the left-hand side.\n\n266\n00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:27.560\nThere is an online archive, but again we\nwill talking about what an archive means.\n\n267\n00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:32.708\nAnd remember since we are doing anything\nwith my Office 365 subscription,\n\n268\n00:13:32.708 --> 00:13:37.622\neverything lives like if you wanna say\nonline in my online storage within my\n\n269\n00:13:37.622 --> 00:13:39.800\nOffice 365 subscription.\n\n270\n00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.040\nSo it's really always hang out there,\nand that's what it does.\n\n271\n00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.300\nSo I went ahead and clicked back on the\ninbox, cuz there's one last thing that I\n\n272\n00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.730\nwanted to point out on this left-hand\nside is at the very, very top.\n\n273\n00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:54.710\nThe jt@officeprodemo.co,\nthat is my main account.\n\n274\n00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:55.928\nIf you click on that,\n\n275\n00:13:55.928 --> 00:13:59.600\nyou're going to go to where this\nplace is called Outlook Today.\n\n276\n00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.360\nDo you remember this, Ronnie?\n\n277\n00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.617\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n&gt;&gt; This has been around for a long time.\n\n278\n00:14:02.617 --> 00:14:06.777\nAnd this was something that I think came\non by default when you opened Outlook\n\n279\n00:14:06.777 --> 00:14:09.512\nwhen, I think back in like 2002 or 2005.\n\n280\n00:14:09.512 --> 00:14:11.079\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI don't remember exactly when, but\n\n281\n00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:12.150\nit's been around forever.\n\n282\n00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it was a long time ago\nthat that was like the default setting.\n\n283\n00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.220\nAnd if you think about it,\nit's like what am I looking at today?\n\n284\n00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.040\nIt's like the front\npage of the news paper.\n\n285\n00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.060\nAnd you could see,\nwhat do I have on my calendar?\n\n286\n00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.067\nWhat are my task?\n\n287\n00:14:23.067 --> 00:14:24.596\nI don't have anything in here right now,\n\n288\n00:14:24.596 --> 00:14:26.660\ncuz we haven't really\nkinda populated that.\n\n289\n00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:30.170\nOnce you start really using Outlook\nto organize your life basically.\n\n290\n00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:33.520\nYou could come here and say,\nwhat do I have on the calendar?\n\n291\n00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.750\nWhat do I have on my tasks?\n\n292\n00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:38.370\nLet me look at the messages, and\nyou can see that you can customize your\n\n293\n00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.650\nOutlook Today to be able\nto do different things.\n\n294\n00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:44.140\nI remember there's the winter and\nthe summer, right, the different looks.\n\n295\n00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.410\nThose have been around, and it really\njust means that ones more yellow and\n\n296\n00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:48.850\nones more blue.\n\n297\n00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:50.360\nThat's really all it does.\n\n298\n00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.520\nBut you can see that\nyou could go ahead and\n\n299\n00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:58.340\nchoose what you want to have in your\nOutlook Today if you want to use it.\n\n300\n00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:03.250\nAnd notice right there, you can see when\nstarting go directly to Outlook Today.\n\n301\n00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.572\nSo if you wanted to do it,\ngo ahead and check that box off and\n\n302\n00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:10.700\nit will give you this kind of overview\nof everything that you're doing.\n\n303\n00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.810\nAnd then you can go into\nyour mail as you want.\n\n304\n00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:16.663\nBy default it always starts by\nopening up into your inbox, but\n\n305\n00:15:16.663 --> 00:15:20.676\nI wanted to point out that\nOutlook Today is still alive and well.\n\n306\n00:15:20.676 --> 00:15:22.660\nIt's a little hidden now,\nif you wanna say.\n\n307\n00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.560\nBut you can go ahead and choose that.\n\n308\n00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.870\nAnd I'm gonna save my changes.\n\n309\n00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.497\nOkay, I'll go with my summer theme.\n\n310\n00:15:27.497 --> 00:15:30.599\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then we have our Outlook Today, and\n\n311\n00:15:30.599 --> 00:15:35.395\nthat's the very top of your\nfolder pane in your navigation.\n\n312\n00:15:35.395 --> 00:15:38.055\nA few things I wanted\nto just point out that\n\n313\n00:15:38.055 --> 00:15:41.875\nyou should know about by being\nover in your folder pane.\n\n314\n00:15:41.875 --> 00:15:46.495\nWe went through everything, but\nright-clicking on your folders\n\n315\n00:15:46.495 --> 00:15:49.420\nwill give you a lot of options,\ncuz you might read tutorials like,\n\n316\n00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.480\nyou need to go into\nthe properties of your inbox.\n\n317\n00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.288\nWell where is that?\n\n318\n00:15:53.288 --> 00:15:57.024\nIf you right-click on it, you can see that\ndown at the bottom there is properties.\n\n319\n00:15:57.024 --> 00:16:01.236\nThere's also some other things like when\nwe get into how we can organize ourselves\n\n320\n00:16:01.236 --> 00:16:02.773\nand make some other folders.\n\n321\n00:16:02.773 --> 00:16:06.603\nIn our mailbox, that's one way\nwe could go ahead and do that.\n\n322\n00:16:06.603 --> 00:16:09.932\nWe can clean up, we'll talk about what\nit means to clean up your folder,\n\n323\n00:16:09.932 --> 00:16:13.700\nyou probably don't want to delete your\nentire inbox, that might not be something\n\n324\n00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.305\nyou want to do, but you can see that you\ncan go through some different options by\n\n325\n00:16:17.305 --> 00:16:21.210\nright clicking on it, and this kind of\nleads into, well, what is the Favorites?\n\n326\n00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:25.080\nUp at the very top left of your navigation\npane, you do have your Favorites,\n\n327\n00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.071\njust think about what are your favorite\nthings in life, what's your favorite\n\n328\n00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:32.164\nthings in Outlook that you want\nto be able to quickly access?\n\n329\n00:16:32.164 --> 00:16:35.901\nCuz when we start making lots of folders,\nmaybe there's a specific folder that\n\n330\n00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:39.022\nyou've put a lot of stuff in that\nyou're always working out of, so\n\n331\n00:16:39.022 --> 00:16:41.230\nyou can go ahead and\nadd that to the Favorites.\n\n332\n00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.596\nAnd notice that there was something by\nright clicking on it where it says,\n\n333\n00:16:44.596 --> 00:16:47.541\nmine says, Remove from Favorites,\nbecause Drafts is in that.\n\n334\n00:16:47.541 --> 00:16:48.911\nSo you could go ahead and\n\n335\n00:16:48.911 --> 00:16:53.775\ncustomize what you want in that Favorites\nsection if you want to go ahead and, well,\n\n336\n00:16:53.775 --> 00:16:57.832\nuse your favorites, so,\nthat's where you've got your Favorites.\n\n337\n00:16:57.832 --> 00:17:01.666\nI've clicked on Drafts,\nlet me go back over into my inbox, now,\n\n338\n00:17:01.666 --> 00:17:06.525\nstaying in the inbox, what do we see in\nour default settings and our default view?\n\n339\n00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:10.392\nOur main section in the middle is\nwhere all of our emails come in,\n\n340\n00:17:10.392 --> 00:17:13.183\nwhat I see right now with the blue and\nthe bold,\n\n341\n00:17:13.183 --> 00:17:17.619\nthat means that I have emails that\nare unread, so I have one from Joey, and\n\n342\n00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:22.236\none from Lance, and I can see that those\nare the ones that I have not read yet.\n\n343\n00:17:22.236 --> 00:17:26.376\nOver on the right hand side is our reading\npane, which we'll get into as well,\n\n344\n00:17:26.376 --> 00:17:30.240\nbut if you look through down here like,\nhow does it group everything?\n\n345\n00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.651\nRight now, it shows me what\nemails have come in today,\n\n346\n00:17:33.651 --> 00:17:37.657\nwhat came in yesterday if I scroll down,\nwhat came in last week,\n\n347\n00:17:37.657 --> 00:17:41.536\nwhat came in two months ago,\nnot months, weeks, weeks ago.\n\n348\n00:17:41.536 --> 00:17:46.538\nThis is an automatic setting of how\nOutlook is grouping your items,\n\n349\n00:17:46.538 --> 00:17:49.170\nand notice it is grouping by dates,\n\n350\n00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:54.894\nbecause another thing is it's default\nsorting by whatever is newest on top.\n\n351\n00:17:54.894 --> 00:17:59.876\nAnd you can see up at the top, it shows\nus that this is sorting by date, and\n\n352\n00:17:59.876 --> 00:18:03.330\nthe newest is on top,\nthe oldest is on the bottom.\n\n353\n00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:07.400\nSo if I scroll down, since I haven't\nreally been using this account too,\n\n354\n00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.563\ntoo much, you can see that my\nend of my list is pretty low.\n\n355\n00:18:10.563 --> 00:18:14.885\nBut I mean, if you've been using your\nemail for a couple of years, it might take\n\n356\n00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:19.205\na really long time to get to the end, or\nthe oldest email within your account, so\n\n357\n00:18:19.205 --> 00:18:21.750\nthose are the default\nsettings that you have.\n\n358\n00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:26.105\nAnd there's going to be little icons over\non the right hand side, for example,\n\n359\n00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:30.590\nthis little icon right here, that means\nthat this has been received, actually,\n\n360\n00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:33.134\nI just realized that is what it means,\nright?\n\n361\n00:18:33.134 --> 00:18:34.350\n&gt;&gt; Opened.\n\n362\n00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:38.981\n&gt;&gt; Opened, right, okay, [LAUGH], wow, I'm\nexplaining to you what the icons mean and\n\n363\n00:18:38.981 --> 00:18:43.222\nI can't even remember what they are,\nbut you'll get used to them as you see,\n\n364\n00:18:43.222 --> 00:18:48.330\nlike there's the little paper clip, that\nmeans that that email had an attachment.\n\n365\n00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:52.310\nThis guy, right here, from last week,\nit's red, why is it red?\n\n366\n00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:56.378\nNow, it means, it's not that it hasn't\nbeen read, I flagged this, I flagged\n\n367\n00:18:56.378 --> 00:19:00.569\nthis for some reason to say hey, follow\nup on this, and we're talking about being\n\n368\n00:19:00.569 --> 00:19:05.280\norganized, we'll talk about what does that\nmean, well, I'm just flagging something.\n\n369\n00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:09.454\nI'm putting a little sticky note on it,\nlike, make sure you follow up with this,\n\n370\n00:19:09.454 --> 00:19:12.719\nand so that's why the red flag is\nover on the right-hand side and\n\n371\n00:19:12.719 --> 00:19:14.246\nwhere the text is red as well.\n\n372\n00:19:14.246 --> 00:19:19.191\nAnd you'll see other icons like,\nthis was a cancelled meeting that was sent\n\n373\n00:19:19.191 --> 00:19:23.515\nby Lance, then this little green\ncheck box, this was a green check\n\n374\n00:19:23.515 --> 00:19:28.470\nbox that I had actually flagged something,\nand then I followed up with it.\n\n375\n00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:31.372\nSo what I wanted to do,\nI wanted to check that flag off, and\n\n376\n00:19:31.372 --> 00:19:34.631\nthen it turns green, so it's like,\nyep, followed off with it,\n\n377\n00:19:34.631 --> 00:19:38.693\nthis is actually kind of connected with\ntasks, that we'll be covering as well.\n\n378\n00:19:38.693 --> 00:19:43.379\nBut in this sense, it's just how am\nI going to keep myself organized, and\n\n379\n00:19:43.379 --> 00:19:48.365\nI really need to look at this later, I'm\nnot ready to look at this or answer it,\n\n380\n00:19:48.365 --> 00:19:52.540\nbut let me flag it, and so\nI use those follow up flags a lot, okay?\n\n381\n00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.982\nAnd so the different icons\nare going to come through here,\n\n382\n00:19:55.982 --> 00:20:00.898\nthe other thing you'll see as the default\nview, is you will see who this is from, so\n\n383\n00:20:00.898 --> 00:20:04.083\nyou can see that this\nparticular email is from Lance.\n\n384\n00:20:04.083 --> 00:20:07.999\nThere is a subject line,\nwhich is saying hi, and\n\n385\n00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:12.530\nthen right now I can see\nthe first line of that email.\n\n386\n00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:16.881\nNotice on this, this is known as message\npreviewing, which we'll be able to modify\n\n387\n00:20:16.881 --> 00:20:20.495\nin a little bit, you can see at this\none it says on this lovely monday and\n\n388\n00:20:20.495 --> 00:20:24.449\nit says end, it's telling me right\nthere that there's nothing past this.\n\n389\n00:20:24.449 --> 00:20:26.682\nBut if I look at an email down here,\n\n390\n00:20:26.682 --> 00:20:31.690\nyou can see that it's given me just like\na snippet and there's obviously more\n\n391\n00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:36.851\nlines within that message body that\nare there, so it doesn't show you the end,\n\n392\n00:20:36.851 --> 00:20:40.580\nbut that's why they have end to well,\nindicate the end.\n\n393\n00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.696\nSo those are all of the default settings\nof how your emails look when they\n\n394\n00:20:44.696 --> 00:20:49.445\nare coming in, well, if there's defaults,\nyou know what that means, Ronnie.\n\n395\n00:20:49.445 --> 00:20:50.362\n&gt;&gt; You can change them.\n\n396\n00:20:50.362 --> 00:20:54.825\n&gt;&gt; We can change them, so we're gonna\nchange the way we're looking at things, so\n\n397\n00:20:54.825 --> 00:20:57.098\nwhat tab are we gonna go to on our ribbon?\n\n398\n00:20:57.098 --> 00:20:59.465\nWe're gonna go to the View tab,\nso in our View tab,\n\n399\n00:20:59.465 --> 00:21:02.548\nthese are some different things\nthat we can turn on, turn off, and\n\n400\n00:21:02.548 --> 00:21:05.710\nchange all the different things\nthat we want to go with.\n\n401\n00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.898\nNow we've identified the folder pane,\nthat's the thing on the left, we've\n\n402\n00:21:09.898 --> 00:21:14.339\nidentified the reading pane, the reading\npane is the thing on the right, so up here\n\n403\n00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:18.348\non our View there is a folder pane, and\nyou can still click on its drop down.\n\n404\n00:21:18.348 --> 00:21:22.575\nAnd there's Normal, Minimize, Off,\nand do I want my Favorites on or off?\n\n405\n00:21:22.575 --> 00:21:25.570\nSo you can go ahead and say,\nwell, let's check minimized,\n\n406\n00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:29.270\nkind of sucks it over there to the left\nand makes a little smaller bar there,\n\n407\n00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:33.083\nup to you how you want to, I have never\nbeen a fan of this, but that's just me,\n\n408\n00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:35.800\nit is a complete personal preference.\n\n409\n00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.589\nI like to be able to see all the folders,\n\n410\n00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:41.403\nit really depends on what type of real\nestate you want, remember those Favorites?\n\n411\n00:21:41.403 --> 00:21:45.288\nIf you dont want to se the Favorites,\nthen just uncheck the Favorites, and\n\n412\n00:21:45.288 --> 00:21:49.000\nthen you just have your regular account,\nkeep the Favorites on or off.\n\n413\n00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.319\nAnd then the folder pane,\nthe Options down at the bottom,\n\n414\n00:21:52.319 --> 00:21:56.520\nthese things out in the bottom,\nthe very bottom of your navigation pane,\n\n415\n00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.599\nlike how many buttons that\ngo across that you can see?\n\n416\n00:21:59.599 --> 00:22:02.928\nNotice it says right now, it says four,\nnow I can increase this and\n\n417\n00:22:02.928 --> 00:22:05.365\nit's not gonna change anything,\nthe reason for\n\n418\n00:22:05.365 --> 00:22:08.060\nme is because of the resolution\nof my monitor, okay?\n\n419\n00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:12.022\nBut if you have a larger monitor, or a\nhigher resolution, you could go ahead and\n\n420\n00:22:12.022 --> 00:22:16.044\nput all of the different buttons for the\nnotes and the tasks, instead of clicking\n\n421\n00:22:16.044 --> 00:22:20.063\non the little dot, dot, dot, the little\nellipsis to where you can go into more,\n\n422\n00:22:20.063 --> 00:22:22.527\nand you change the order\nof them if you wanted to.\n\n423\n00:22:22.527 --> 00:22:28.104\nI keep them all in defaults, cuz I'm just\nkind of used to looking at it that way,\n\n424\n00:22:28.104 --> 00:22:33.380\nbut I wanted at least to show you, so\nthat you know what that is indicating.\n\n425\n00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:36.306\nReading pane, do I want it to the right,\ndo I want it to the bottom, or\n\n426\n00:22:36.306 --> 00:22:37.021\ndo I want it off?\n\n427\n00:22:37.021 --> 00:22:42.027\nCompletely up to you, if I go to the\nbottom, notice it does change the whole\n\n428\n00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:47.320\nlook of my inbox, like the default\nplace where I'm listing all my emails.\n\n429\n00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:51.654\nIt puts them more in a list view and\nit gives me different columns, because,\n\n430\n00:22:51.654 --> 00:22:56.530\nwith an e-mail that comes in, there's\na lot of different, we'll say properties,\n\n431\n00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:58.721\nI think they're called properties?\n\n432\n00:22:58.721 --> 00:22:59.426\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n433\n00:22:59.426 --> 00:23:03.458\n&gt;&gt; We'll call them properties,\nwhat is the subject, who is it from,\n\n434\n00:23:03.458 --> 00:23:06.924\nwhen was it received,\nwhat is the size of the attachment,\n\n435\n00:23:06.924 --> 00:23:10.283\ndoes it have an importance,\ndoes it have a follow-up?\n\n436\n00:23:10.283 --> 00:23:15.003\nAll of these columns are the things that\ncan be associated with an email, and\n\n437\n00:23:15.003 --> 00:23:19.134\nin this particular view of putting\nthe reading pane to the bottom,\n\n438\n00:23:19.134 --> 00:23:24.075\nit's going to go ahead and give us a more\nlist like, columnized, columnized,\n\n439\n00:23:24.075 --> 00:23:25.670\nis that a word, Ronnie?\n\n440\n00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:26.912\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n441\n00:23:26.912 --> 00:23:27.788\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n442\n00:23:27.788 --> 00:23:28.948\n&gt;&gt; It is now.\n\n443\n00:23:28.948 --> 00:23:33.453\n[LAUGH] So in a columnized view, so that's\nwhat the reading pane does when you put,\n\n444\n00:23:33.453 --> 00:23:37.957\nwell, what the view does when you put the\nreading at the bottom, or you can go ahead\n\n445\n00:23:37.957 --> 00:23:42.420\nand turn it off, and it still stays\nwithin this list view, if you want.\n\n446\n00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:46.669\nI'm gonna go ahead and put it back over on\nthe right, and you can see it goes ahead\n\n447\n00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:51.049\nand changes this, some other things that\nwe have across here, we have our to do bar\n\n448\n00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:55.519\nand our people pane, to do bar, well, that\nsounds like, what am I gonna do today?\n\n449\n00:23:55.519 --> 00:23:58.691\nBut just like that Outlook today\nview that we were looking at,\n\n450\n00:23:58.691 --> 00:24:02.351\nthere's other things besides emailing,\nI might have appointments,\n\n451\n00:24:02.351 --> 00:24:06.443\nI might have certain people that I need to\ntalk to, or that I talk to all the time.\n\n452\n00:24:06.443 --> 00:24:09.526\nSo if I turn on these different\npieces in the to-do bar,\n\n453\n00:24:09.526 --> 00:24:12.370\nyou can see it puts my\ncalendar over there.\n\n454\n00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:16.020\nIf I turn on my, and I have nothing\nscheduled in the next seven days.\n\n455\n00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.190\nMan.\nThen why am I here?\n\n456\n00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.700\nNo, cuz I'm here with you guys\nto be able to show you all\n\n457\n00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.490\nthe beautiful things about Outlook.\n\n458\n00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:24.030\nWell if we keep on going down to,\nwhat am I gonna show with my people.\n\n459\n00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:28.000\nNow, I have specified in this, and\nthen there's a little bit behind my head.\n\n460\n00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.414\nSo you can see that\nJoey's hanging out there,\n\n461\n00:24:29.414 --> 00:24:31.020\ncuz he's kind of poking out\nto the sides over there.\n\n462\n00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.860\nAnd he was like, well, okay.\n\n463\n00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:38.130\nBut see, because I turned on\nthe people in my to-do bar and\n\n464\n00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.950\nI designated in my contacts that\nJoey is one of my favorites.\n\n465\n00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.975\nOnce we get in the contacts area, we'll\ngo ahead and show you what that means and\n\n466\n00:24:44.975 --> 00:24:46.074\nhow you can mark favorites.\n\n467\n00:24:46.074 --> 00:24:50.487\nBecause maybe there certain people, well,\nthat you're always talking to like JT and\n\n468\n00:24:50.487 --> 00:24:53.570\nJoey, they talk all the time, so\nhe put them as a favorite and\n\n469\n00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.330\nhe put him in the to-do bar.\n\n470\n00:24:55.330 --> 00:25:00.433\nI can also go ahead and turn on my tasks\nand you can see that just goes ahead and\n\n471\n00:25:00.433 --> 00:25:05.941\nkeeps on lining up over here on the right\nhand side within this to-do bar of just,\n\n472\n00:25:05.941 --> 00:25:10.508\nwell, keeping me on task, and\non point of what I need to do in here.\n\n473\n00:25:10.508 --> 00:25:12.508\nSo you could go ahead and\nturn that on, off, and\n\n474\n00:25:12.508 --> 00:25:14.190\nwhatever different pieces you want.\n\n475\n00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:15.690\nI'm gonna go ahead and turn it off now.\n\n476\n00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:18.930\nSo that way it goes back\nto our normal view.\n\n477\n00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:20.740\nLet's go into our people pane.\n\n478\n00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.030\nWhat is the people pane mean?\n\n479\n00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.130\nWell, let's turn it on and\nsee what happens.\n\n480\n00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:27.090\nThis means when you go ahead and\nget an email in, this bottom pane,\n\n481\n00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:30.700\nI remember this was on by\ndefault on one of my set-ups and\n\n482\n00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.180\nI'm like, why does this keep coming,\nand I would minimize it.\n\n483\n00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.487\nSee right down here, there's this little\nminimize and I would always collapse.\n\n484\n00:25:36.487 --> 00:25:39.455\nI'm like,\nI really don't want it to come on at all.\n\n485\n00:25:39.455 --> 00:25:40.917\nCan it really just stop doing that?\n\n486\n00:25:40.917 --> 00:25:43.859\nI didn't know what it was called so\nI didn't know how to turn it off.\n\n487\n00:25:43.859 --> 00:25:47.868\nBut then I just started poking around and\nI'm like, it's the people pain so\n\n488\n00:25:47.868 --> 00:25:52.290\nI figured out that that was what it\nwas doing and that I didn't like it.\n\n489\n00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:57.410\nBut it will give you that Lance is\na person that is with this e-mail,\n\n490\n00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:00.820\nand it will, it is kind of nice\nonce you start looking at it\n\n491\n00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:05.460\nbecause you can see that\nit's associating every thing\n\n492\n00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:10.200\nthat is in your Outlook right\nnow that has to do with Lance.\n\n493\n00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.920\nSo you can see that he sent me some\nemails and there's an attachments.\n\n494\n00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.490\nThere was a cancelled meeting.\n\n495\n00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:20.394\nThere's an email that said vote, and if I\nlook over through here I can also start\n\n496\n00:26:20.394 --> 00:26:23.248\nfiltering it by,\nwhat were the attachments,\n\n497\n00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:27.075\nwhat were the meetings, and so\nit's actually kind of handy.\n\n498\n00:26:27.075 --> 00:26:31.930\nOnce I got used to it I actually turn this\npeople pane back on because it's really\n\n499\n00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:35.295\nmore of,\neverything that's associated with Lance.\n\n500\n00:26:35.295 --> 00:26:38.258\nSo it helps you with,\njust organization and\n\n501\n00:26:38.258 --> 00:26:41.633\njust being able to know\nwhat's going on in there.\n\n502\n00:26:41.633 --> 00:26:44.205\nAnd so I,\nI really kind of like that, and so\n\n503\n00:26:44.205 --> 00:26:48.010\nthose are the different things\nthat we have through our views.\n\n504\n00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:52.192\nA few last little things\nthat I wanted to point out.\n\n505\n00:26:52.192 --> 00:26:55.860\nOver on the left hand side of our\nview tab we have, because when\n\n506\n00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.030\nwe were turning on and off reading pains\nor bars it was changing things around.\n\n507\n00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.360\nI'm gonna turn that people pane off again.\n\n508\n00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.180\nIf you go to change view,\nthere's also compact, single and preview.\n\n509\n00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.470\nIt's really just kind of\nlike an altogether changing\n\n510\n00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:12.980\nof what everything looks like, so\nlet's just look at them really quickly.\n\n511\n00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.410\nWe have single, and\nsingle just goes ahead and\n\n512\n00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:17.780\nmakes like where it's like a single line.\n\n513\n00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:22.550\nAnd then you also have your preview,\nand the preview goes ahead, to me,\n\n514\n00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:24.700\nit's like, it's not really a preview.\n\n515\n00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.980\nTo me, preview is more like with\nthe reading pane on the right.\n\n516\n00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.270\nBut again,\n\n517\n00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:33.400\nit's really just kinda quick ways that\nyou can change what your view looks like.\n\n518\n00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.640\nI'm gonna go back to that compact view.\n\n519\n00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.410\nOkay, a few other little things.\n\n520\n00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:40.570\nThe Message Preview, the lines, right,\n\n521\n00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:44.550\nwhere I could see one line of\nmy message within this list.\n\n522\n00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:48.710\nWell, Message Preview will go ahead and\nbe able to show if you wanted more lines,\n\n523\n00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:51.200\nmaybe you wanted three lines to show.\n\n524\n00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.745\nAnd notice that when I\nchange this its asking for,\n\n525\n00:27:53.745 --> 00:27:56.359\nwhat do you wanna change\nthat's in all mailboxes?\n\n526\n00:27:56.359 --> 00:27:58.860\nYou're like, well,\nI only have one mailbox.\n\n527\n00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:02.060\nWell, you have multiple mailboxes in\nthe sense that there's an archive and\n\n528\n00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.430\nyou also have multiple folders.\n\n529\n00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.860\nHow you want your sents to be shown,\nhow you want your drafts to be shown.\n\n530\n00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:12.652\nSo it's really more of, the folders within\nin you mailbox is what it's really saying.\n\n531\n00:28:12.652 --> 00:28:16.930\nI'm gonna just go with this folder only,\njust to show you what it's going to do.l\n\n532\n00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:21.593\nAnd, well, it doesn't, well, I have to get\nto emails that have more than two lines.\n\n533\n00:28:21.593 --> 00:28:23.050\nThere we go, Ronnie.\n\n534\n00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:25.940\nSo I can see that in\nthese billing statements,\n\n535\n00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.640\nthat's where I can have more or\nless lines.\n\n536\n00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.550\nIt's really up to you.\n\n537\n00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:33.290\nOr you can just turn them off and have it\nto where I don't want any of the previews.\n\n538\n00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:37.130\nCuz maybe you have so many emails you\nreally don't want that to be shown.\n\n539\n00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:40.490\nI'm gonna go back to the one,\nokay, let me change this.\n\n540\n00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:42.420\nThe last one I wanted to show you.\n\n541\n00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:46.150\nAll right, remember how I said\nthe grouping, the today, the yesterday,\n\n542\n00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:47.490\nthe last week.\n\n543\n00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:48.570\nI like this.\n\n544\n00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.120\nI never really saw a problem with it.\n\n545\n00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.363\nBut what if you didn't\nwant it to show that way?\n\n546\n00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:56.890\nI don't want it to organize and\ngroup by the dates.\n\n547\n00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:58.430\nIf you go into your view settings, and\n\n548\n00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.940\nthis is where it can go really crazy on\nall the different things that you can do.\n\n549\n00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:09.950\nBut you can see that it's going into\nthe group by, notice that it says none.\n\n550\n00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:11.240\nSo it's a little confusing.\n\n551\n00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.120\nYou're like, well,\nit's not grouped by anything, but it is.\n\n552\n00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.000\nYou go to Grouped By,\n\n553\n00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.320\ndo you see where it says automatically\ngroup according to arrangement?\n\n554\n00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.070\nIt's arranged by dates.\n\n555\n00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:24.400\nSo if I unchecked that and click OK,\n\n556\n00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:30.210\nand click OK again,\nall of those groups are going to go away.\n\n557\n00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:31.840\nJust in case you didn't like it and\n\n558\n00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:37.180\nyou wanted to turn it off, I am gonna turn\nit back on cuz I tend to think it's nice.\n\n559\n00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:37.783\nAnd again,\n\n560\n00:29:37.783 --> 00:29:42.304\nwe're sorting it by date right now, really\nquickly, we're gonna have another episode\n\n561\n00:29:42.304 --> 00:29:45.819\nwhere we do a lot more about searching\nhow to kinda organize ourself.\n\n562\n00:29:45.819 --> 00:29:49.367\nBut if you don't wanna sort it by\ndate at the tops of column you can\n\n563\n00:29:49.367 --> 00:29:53.300\nalways come down here cuz maybe\nyou are trying to find something.\n\n564\n00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:56.250\nYou can always sort it\nby different things.\n\n565\n00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:00.160\nSince we are talking about email,\nI think date makes the most sense,\n\n566\n00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.370\nbut if you ever needed to change it here\nyou could do it and then change it back.\n\n567\n00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:08.460\nChange it from, do you want the oldest or\nnewest on top and\n\n568\n00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.380\nso, it's different ways of sorting and\nfiltering, if you want to say.\n\n569\n00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.510\nIt's really sorting,\nwe're not really filtering.\n\n570\n00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:15.850\nSo, we're sorting our emails.\n\n571\n00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:20.050\nAnd, I think that covers everything\nabout the email interface\n\n572\n00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.330\nthat I have listed in my notes.\n\n573\n00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:23.198\nSo, I think we're done, Ronnie.\n\n574\n00:30:23.198 --> 00:30:24.346\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne,\n\n575\n00:30:24.346 --> 00:30:28.202\nwell, thank you for introducing\nus to the email interface itself.\n\n576\n00:30:28.202 --> 00:30:32.450\nRemember that there's a lot more to\nwhat you're actually seeing before you.\n\n577\n00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:34.880\nMost of us might just jump in there,\nand send emails and\n\n578\n00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.440\nnever explore all of\nthe options that you'll see.\n\n579\n00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.020\nBut realize, it is a powerful\ninterface that we can do more\n\n580\n00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:44.870\nin the display that we have, as well as\nchange the way that we interact with it.\n\n581\n00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:49.360\nIt takes a little more time but\nat least now you'll have the ability to\n\n582\n00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.730\ncontinue forward with the show and\nknow exactly what we're talking about.\n\n583\n00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:55.510\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to also sign off then.\n\n584\n00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:58.580\nFor Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n585\n00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.600\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n586\n00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.379\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Outlook 2016 shows.\n\n587\n00:31:02.379 --> 00:31:06.452\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Thank you Daniel,\nglad to be here with you, yes.\n\n9\n00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.260\nAnd we're talking today-\n&gt;&gt; Stop.\n\n10\n00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.802\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n11\n00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:29.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And today,\n\n12\n00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.330\nwe're going to be talking\nabout Focused Inbox.\n\n13\n00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.590\nAnd if you're watching these episodes\nin order, you're like, well,\n\n14\n00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.050\none, Vonne's wearing a different shirt.\n\n15\n00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.583\nAnd, two, we have a different host.\n\n16\n00:00:39.583 --> 00:00:41.188\nIt's not Ronnie anymore,\n\n17\n00:00:41.188 --> 00:00:45.950\nbecause I'm putting this episode in\nthe order right after the Email interface.\n\n18\n00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.400\nSo this is almost like a part two,\nbut it's not a part two.\n\n19\n00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.658\nIt's a continuation of the interface, so\nit's not really a part two at all, is it?\n\n20\n00:00:55.658 --> 00:00:57.925\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's its own episode, but\n\n21\n00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:01.711\nit's something that actually\nhappen to me just last week.\n\n22\n00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:05.857\nFilming, we were right in the middle\nof filming the Outlook 2016,\n\n23\n00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:07.870\nwe've done quite a few episodes.\n\n24\n00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.195\nAnd now I'm just like,\nI come back to my desk and I'm like,\n\n25\n00:01:11.582 --> 00:01:15.445\nIt doesn't look the same as when I was\njust in the studio, what just happened?\n\n26\n00:01:15.445 --> 00:01:19.078\n&gt;&gt; No, our sweet little lamb here got\nangry and frustrated at the same time.\n\n27\n00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:23.214\nI thought the world was gonna implode on\nitself with the fire and the snorting,\n\n28\n00:01:23.214 --> 00:01:23.975\nit was crazy.\n\n29\n00:01:23.975 --> 00:01:25.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI did have a little mini-meltdown.\n\n30\n00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.674\nBecause I originally just thought,\nokay, all right, well,\n\n31\n00:01:29.674 --> 00:01:31.934\nsomething changed in the interface.\n\n32\n00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:34.750\nLet me just switch it back,\nI couldn't switch back.\n\n33\n00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.300\nAnd I'm thinking well,\nI'm filming this entire show based\n\n34\n00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.280\non the interface that\nI am presenting here.\n\n35\n00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.650\nAnd now, my interface has changed.\n\n36\n00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.642\nAnd while it really is,\nit's a small thing,\n\n37\n00:01:47.642 --> 00:01:49.850\nit really is a very small\nchange in the interface.\n\n38\n00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.528\nBut it's one of those, that it's small\nenough to be really, really big.\n\n39\n00:01:53.528 --> 00:01:58.290\nAnytime that your environment changes, and\nMicrosoft decides to put a button that\n\n40\n00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.884\nonce was on the right,\nbut it's on the left.\n\n41\n00:02:00.884 --> 00:02:02.386\nIt throws your whole world off for\na while.\n\n42\n00:02:02.386 --> 00:02:05.715\n&gt;&gt; It's a paradigm shift,\nand people get really crazy.\n\n43\n00:02:05.715 --> 00:02:08.014\nBecause they're so\nused to being able to, I mean,\n\n44\n00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:11.298\nyou almost get muscle memory to\ngoing to things that you're used to.\n\n45\n00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:13.838\nThere's where my Start button is,\nthere's where this button is,\n\n46\n00:02:13.838 --> 00:02:15.360\nthere's where that button is.\n\n47\n00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.770\nAnd when you change that on someone,\nthey feel lost in the woods.\n\n48\n00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.809\nAnd we've all be there, we've all\ndone that, we all understand that.\n\n49\n00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:27.030\nSo today, I guess we're gonna talk about\nfinding our ways through those woods.\n\n50\n00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.531\nUnderstanding where has\nMicrosoft put things and, so\n\n51\n00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:31.840\nthat we can become more\nfamiliarized with it.\n\n52\n00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.140\nThat being said, what do they mean\nwhen they say Focused Inbox, Vonne?\n\n53\n00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.160\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n54\n00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.280\nif you're looking at the interface in the\nepisode that you just finished watching.\n\n55\n00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.960\nIf you're, again, in order,\nmine doesn't look anything like that.\n\n56\n00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.027\nSo let's jump down into my computer, and\n\n57\n00:02:46.027 --> 00:02:49.287\nlet me give you some demonstrations\nas to what I am talking about.\n\n58\n00:02:49.287 --> 00:02:51.589\nSo right here,\nI'm in Joey's inbox right now.\n\n59\n00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:55.139\nBecause as you know,\nI'm multiple people in this episode, and\n\n60\n00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.360\nsometimes-\n&gt;&gt; True schizophrenic.\n\n61\n00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.901\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and sometimes you take on some\n\n62\n00:02:57.901 --> 00:02:59.201\nother personalities as well.\n\n63\n00:02:59.201 --> 00:02:59.718\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n64\n00:02:59.718 --> 00:03:02.891\n&gt;&gt; So\nit's all a big fun game of who's who.\n\n65\n00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:03.611\n&gt;&gt; Who's who.\n\n66\n00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:05.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right now, so\nthis is Joey's inbox.\n\n67\n00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.944\nAnd you can see in the interface, the way\nthat we had filmed the previous episode.\n\n68\n00:03:09.944 --> 00:03:14.102\nWhere we had the buttons on the top,\nwhere we had All, Unread, Mentions, and\n\n69\n00:03:14.102 --> 00:03:15.301\nsorted them by dates.\n\n70\n00:03:15.301 --> 00:03:19.806\nAnd I just touched upon it, we didn't\nreally go into depth as to using those and\n\n71\n00:03:19.806 --> 00:03:24.127\nthe functionalities of that top row,\nI'm calling it, with the buttons.\n\n72\n00:03:24.127 --> 00:03:27.960\nBut I did show it, well, this is Joey.\n\n73\n00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.456\nAnd let me show you JT, because JT was\nthe account that I was teaching from,\n\n74\n00:03:33.456 --> 00:03:35.210\nand now look at the top.\n\n75\n00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.940\nThere's no Mentions, there's no Unread,\n\n76\n00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.260\nand there's no buttons of the Sort By,\nthe dates and how to arrange it.\n\n77\n00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.864\nAnd so I was like, what just happened?\n\n78\n00:03:42.864 --> 00:03:47.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is the new interface that all of\n\n79\n00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.200\nyour Outlook 2016s are going to.\n\n80\n00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.040\nNow this is something\nthat's not new to me.\n\n81\n00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.680\nI've seen this because, I think,\nI know you use Outlook.com, you go online.\n\n82\n00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.740\nYou don't have Outlook installed\non your computer, correct?\n\n83\n00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.850\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n84\n00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this doesn't look\nanything new to you, correct?\n\n85\n00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.423\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because Outlook.com has been\n\n86\n00:04:05.423 --> 00:04:09.802\nusing this interface for a while,\nso I wasn't completely thrown off.\n\n87\n00:04:09.802 --> 00:04:11.936\nBut enough to where I thought,\n\n88\n00:04:11.936 --> 00:04:17.270\nlocally installed versions of\nOutlook don't have this just yet.\n\n89\n00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.730\nSo, what happened, why did it happen,\nand how can I use it?\n\n90\n00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.841\nSo it changed over to the Focused and\nthe Other.\n\n91\n00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:27.685\nAnd then if I come over\nhere to the View tab,\n\n92\n00:04:27.685 --> 00:04:32.508\nI have a new button on the View tab\nthat says, Show Focused inbox, okay.\n\n93\n00:04:32.508 --> 00:04:35.905\nSo what does this all mean?\n\n94\n00:04:35.905 --> 00:04:41.142\nWhat a Focused Inbox,\nit's Outlook being smart for us.\n\n95\n00:04:41.142 --> 00:04:46.080\nIt is where Outlook is determining\nwhat email comes to you,\n\n96\n00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.061\nthat it thinks is important to you.\n\n97\n00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:52.550\nAnd then the Other,\nthat's kind of secondary.\n\n98\n00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.350\nBecause we get e-mails all day long,\nand we usually get a lot of junk mail,\n\n99\n00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.150\nand we do have an entire\nepisode about junk mail.\n\n100\n00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.270\nAnd what gets treated as junk,\nwhat gets treated as Other,\n\n101\n00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.630\nwhat gets treated as Focused.\n\n102\n00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.780\nIt's kind of right now,\nI feel that, Outlook and Microsoft,\n\n103\n00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.566\nthey're kind of in a shifting phase,\nright?\n\n104\n00:05:10.566 --> 00:05:14.800\nThey're in a transition right now,\nof all of these different services.\n\n105\n00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.394\nFor Outlook to really help you, to be able\nto just get to what you need to get, and\n\n106\n00:05:19.394 --> 00:05:21.395\nnot get you all the other clutter.\n\n107\n00:05:21.395 --> 00:05:24.169\nI'm mentioning clutter,\nspecifically, as a word.\n\n108\n00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.873\nBecause there are some previous\nversions of Outlook that was using\n\n109\n00:05:28.873 --> 00:05:31.396\na Clutter folder, your junk mail.\n\n110\n00:05:31.396 --> 00:05:34.661\nSo if you're coming from Outlook 2013, or\n\n111\n00:05:34.661 --> 00:05:38.588\nany type of Office 365 where\nyou had a Clutter folder?\n\n112\n00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:43.960\nWell, this is the new Clutter,\nthis is the new Junk.\n\n113\n00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.960\nEven though we still have Junk Mail, it's\njust trying to sort out your mail for you.\n\n114\n00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.730\nI think this can be a good feature, but\nof course it's like, well, Microsoft,\n\n115\n00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.920\nhow do you know it's important to me?\n\n116\n00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.887\nI know it's important to me,\nso can you please stop?\n\n117\n00:05:58.887 --> 00:06:01.889\nSo it's funny, if you go online,\nyou start looking at message boards?\n\n118\n00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.276\nThere are people just\nup in arms about this.\n\n119\n00:06:04.276 --> 00:06:06.765\nHow are you supposed to tell\nme what I'm supposed to do?\n\n120\n00:06:06.765 --> 00:06:09.406\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They're not happy.\n\n121\n00:06:09.406 --> 00:06:12.280\nBut that's something-\n&gt;&gt; And they say it exactly like that, too.\n\n122\n00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.076\n&gt;&gt; Yes, all caps, I'm very mad!\n\n123\n00:06:15.076 --> 00:06:17.202\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, it's one of those,\n\n124\n00:06:17.202 --> 00:06:21.626\nwe're in transition, and\nanything that starts being different,\n\n125\n00:06:21.626 --> 00:06:24.041\nit gets us a little worked up, okay.\n\n126\n00:06:24.041 --> 00:06:28.360\nSo, it's a good thing,\nif you want it to be-\n\n127\n00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n128\n00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.074\n&gt;&gt; And if you allow it to be.\n\n129\n00:06:31.074 --> 00:06:34.070\nNow, how did I get this to change?\n\n130\n00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.600\nWe have talked in our\nepisodes about updates, and\n\n131\n00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.220\nwhat version of Outlook that you are in.\n\n132\n00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.020\nNow that's gonna be another big thing.\n\n133\n00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.865\nSo let's jump over here to Joey,\nso Joey's account.\n\n134\n00:06:44.865 --> 00:06:48.277\nI'm gonna come over here to my file, and\nI'm gonna go over to my Office account.\n\n135\n00:06:48.277 --> 00:06:50.309\nAnd over here in the Product Information,\n\n136\n00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:53.025\nthere's always somewhere where\nyou need to be aware of.\n\n137\n00:06:53.025 --> 00:06:57.720\nCuz right here, you can see that this is\nVersion 1703, and there's a build number.\n\n138\n00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.270\nAnd then I also have,\nwhat type of update schedule I'm on.\n\n139\n00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.390\nRight now, Current Channel means that it's\ngoing to be updating itself every month,\n\n140\n00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.060\nautomatically.\n\n141\n00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.244\nThere is another channel, which I honestly\ncan't remember the name of it, but\n\n142\n00:07:12.244 --> 00:07:13.877\nit updates every four months.\n\n143\n00:07:13.877 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd these are the settings that you\ncan control in your Admin section.\n\n144\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:23.115\nAnd you can say, that I want to be on the\nCurrent Channel, or the Deferred Channel?\n\n145\n00:07:23.115 --> 00:07:26.632\nI don't think that's the right name,\nbut I can go and look up which it is.\n\n146\n00:07:26.632 --> 00:07:29.206\nIt's basically one choice or\nthe other choice, okay,\n\n147\n00:07:29.206 --> 00:07:30.590\nwhichever one you want to do.\n\n148\n00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.955\nNow these are settings that you\nmight not be able to control.\n\n149\n00:07:32.955 --> 00:07:37.961\nIf you're in an environment, that your\nIT department controls when you update.\n\n150\n00:07:37.961 --> 00:07:41.977\nBut if you're more of a personal user,\nor in a small organization,\n\n151\n00:07:41.977 --> 00:07:43.460\nyou have access to that?\n\n152\n00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.650\nThen that's something\nthat you can control.\n\n153\n00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.900\nSo something you might not be able to.\n\n154\n00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.260\nLet's jump over to JT's account,\nand let's go over here to File, and\n\n155\n00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.500\ngo into the Office account here.\n\n156\n00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:01.696\nNotice his version is 1704, and\nit's a build that's 8,000-something,\n\n157\n00:08:01.696 --> 00:08:04.590\nthe other build was 7,000-something.\n\n158\n00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:08.110\nSo right here,\nthat's a big indication, to me,\n\n159\n00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:13.920\nthat JT is on the next version or\nthe next update of that Office product.\n\n160\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.385\nAnd in that update, that's probably where\nthe Focused and the Other came about.\n\n161\n00:08:19.385 --> 00:08:25.091\nAnd so that's, I think, the reason\nof why JT's account went ahead and\n\n162\n00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:27.861\nchanged, versus Joey and Lance.\n\n163\n00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:30.524\nThat I also have other virtual\nmachines that have those.\n\n164\n00:08:30.524 --> 00:08:32.758\nThey're not updated, and so\nthey don't have the Focused.\n\n165\n00:08:32.758 --> 00:08:36.185\nThey have the same, well I guess\nyou can call it old school way,\n\n166\n00:08:36.185 --> 00:08:38.330\neven though it's not really that old.\n\n167\n00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.070\n&gt;&gt; Justin's through the looking glass,\nas it were.\n\n168\n00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.390\nHe's on the other side of, welcome to\nthe new ways in which we do things, and\n\n169\n00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.090\nyou're not going back.\n\n170\n00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.850\nAnd the other guys aren't there now.\n\n171\n00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.854\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and that was where, well\nI'll just set it, I can't set it back.\n\n172\n00:08:50.854 --> 00:08:56.407\nOver in JT, the only thing I have control\nover in my View tab Iis whether I want,\n\n173\n00:08:56.407 --> 00:08:59.619\nwhether or not I want it to Focus or\nnot Focus.\n\n174\n00:08:59.619 --> 00:09:02.805\nAnd that's kind of a nice thing, if\neveryone's, I don't want focus to happen,\n\n175\n00:09:02.805 --> 00:09:04.440\njust turn it off.\n\n176\n00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.110\nAnd if I click this,\nnow you can see that it just says, Inbox.\n\n177\n00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:13.011\nThere's no automatic sorting, based upon\nMicrosoft's looking at your mail and\n\n178\n00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:14.866\ndetermining what goes where.\n\n179\n00:09:14.866 --> 00:09:19.640\nIt's like, no, okay, fine, I won't go\nahead and use your Focused anymore.\n\n180\n00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.500\nAnd so that's how you can turn it off,\nif you don't like that feature.\n\n181\n00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.330\n&gt;&gt; What is it exactly is it focusing on?\n\n182\n00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.490\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of like,\n\n183\n00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:28.570\nyou know how junk mail-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n184\n00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.210\n&gt;&gt; Where it determines,\nthis is junk, this is spam,\n\n185\n00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.970\nthis is people just doing\na email blast to you.\n\n186\n00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.500\n&gt;&gt; So instead of, I mean,\nwe obviously have the junk mail,\n\n187\n00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.466\nI can see right there\non your left hand pane.\n\n188\n00:09:38.466 --> 00:09:42.464\nBut junk mail's junk mail, but you\nmight have some stuff that's not maybe,\n\n189\n00:09:42.464 --> 00:09:43.272\nlike you said.\n\n190\n00:09:43.272 --> 00:09:45.161\nPeople are saying,\nhow do you know what's important to me?\n\n191\n00:09:45.161 --> 00:09:47.927\nIt still goes to your inbox,\nit's still technically in your inbox.\n\n192\n00:09:47.927 --> 00:09:51.039\nIt's just not hitting that Focus,\nif you have Focus turned on.\n\n193\n00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:55.909\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, I know for\nexample, when I use Focus.\n\n194\n00:09:55.909 --> 00:09:58.379\nBecause the Focused and\nOther, like I said,\n\n195\n00:09:58.379 --> 00:10:02.739\nit was already being used on Outlook.com,\nand it was also for Outlook for Mac.\n\n196\n00:10:02.739 --> 00:10:07.563\nAnd with our ITProTV email, I had it set\nup on my Mac, and I go online to check it,\n\n197\n00:10:07.563 --> 00:10:08.867\nI have it on my phone.\n\n198\n00:10:08.867 --> 00:10:13.327\nSo I've been seeing this for a long time,\nthe things like the Twitter alerts.\n\n199\n00:10:13.327 --> 00:10:15.667\nWhen it says that we're\nbeing live right now, and\n\n200\n00:10:15.667 --> 00:10:17.345\nit goes out to our Twitter account.\n\n201\n00:10:17.345 --> 00:10:20.410\nBecause we have a great social media\nperson that manages all that for\n\n202\n00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.090\nus, which is great,\nthat goes into the Other.\n\n203\n00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.760\nWhen I get a new login, when it says,\n\n204\n00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.790\nhey you've logged into Dropbox\nin another virtual machine.\n\n205\n00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.999\nBecause you've built your virtual\nmachines 15 times in the last two weeks,\n\n206\n00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:33.321\nthat gets put into the Other​.\n\n207\n00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:36.894\nWhen we do our scheduling\nupdates on whatever, was it fox?\n\n208\n00:10:36.894 --> 00:10:37.432\n&gt;&gt; OMS?\n\n209\n00:10:37.432 --> 00:10:40.064\n&gt;&gt; Our scheduling thing that we work with,\nto know what studios and\n\n210\n00:10:40.064 --> 00:10:42.370\nwhat time we're doing,\nthat all gets sent to my Other.\n\n211\n00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.951\nSo it's those types of things,\nthat's, it's there, so it's not junk,\n\n212\n00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:51.329\nit's not being deleted, it's just\nkind of putting it over to the side.\n\n213\n00:10:51.329 --> 00:10:54.185\nAnd then it's,\nthe Focused are the ones like, hey,\n\n214\n00:10:54.185 --> 00:10:56.355\nthere's key lime pie in the break room.\n\n215\n00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:57.782\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In the break room, yeah.\n\n216\n00:10:57.782 --> 00:11:00.153\nYeah, things from Renee, things from Tim.\n\n217\n00:11:00.153 --> 00:11:03.095\nThings from people within our\norganization, that gets into my Focus.\n\n218\n00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:04.323\n&gt;&gt;

No cutting.\n\n362\n00:18:22.761 --> 00:18:26.457\n&gt;&gt; We're cluttering, we're de-cluttering,\nso that's what's going on.\n\n363\n00:18:26.457 --> 00:18:28.126\nIt says, can you keep using it?\n\n364\n00:18:28.126 --> 00:18:32.560\nYou can, but it's going to be replaced,\nso you might as well give it up now.\n\n365\n00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.005\nCan I turn, will I still be\nable to use the Focus, yes.\n\n366\n00:18:37.492 --> 00:18:41.920\nHow does it work, does it sort\nmy mail as soon as it turns on?\n\n367\n00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:47.170\nIt says, yes it does, but it will get\nsmarter as it goes, so you could see that.\n\n368\n00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:50.816\nAnd then, I am already using the Focused,\nis anything gonna change, no.\n\n369\n00:18:50.816 --> 00:18:53.048\nSo this is a really\ngood page to reference,\n\n370\n00:18:53.048 --> 00:18:55.284\nto give you a little bit more information.\n\n371\n00:18:55.284 --> 00:19:00.076\nFrom the source, right from the horse's\nmouth, right from Microsoft, and so\n\n372\n00:19:00.076 --> 00:19:02.810\nyou can understand what the Focused is.\n\n373\n00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:08.090\nThe nice thing is, you can turn it off if\nyou want to, and have it stop doing that.\n\n374\n00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:11.530\nBut that's what's going to\nbe new in your Outlook 2016,\n\n375\n00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.880\nof a locally-installed,\nif you have updates.\n\n376\n00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.572\nSo wanted to let you all know, and\n\n377\n00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:19.915\nI think that covers everything I\nwanted to cover there, Daniel.\n\n378\n00:19:19.915 --> 00:19:23.182\n&gt;&gt; All right, we'll be on the lookout for\nthat Focused Inbox,\n\n379\n00:19:23.182 --> 00:19:25.562\ncoming your way this May 2017, right?\n\n380\n00:19:25.562 --> 00:19:27.031\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:41.140\nSo one recipient.\n\n14\n00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.750\nRonnie and I are going to be sending\nsome emails back and forth, so\n\n15\n00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.540\nwe can just kinda get our feet wet with\nsome super basic, let's just get started.\n\n16\n00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.740\nSo why don't we go ahead and\njump down into my computer,\n\n17\n00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.230\nso I can start demonstrating here.\n\n18\n00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.040\nSo I've got Outlook already opened and\nI have some emails in here that I was\n\n19\n00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.750\nsetting up for our part twos and possibly,\nprobably, maybe, not probably, maybe.\n\n20\n00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.620\nIt's probably gonna definitely\ngonna go into a part three.\n\n21\n00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.240\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; How many times can I say probably in\n\n22\n00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.844\nthat sentence?\n\n23\n00:01:12.844 --> 00:01:14.117\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A lot.\n\n24\n00:01:14.117 --> 00:01:15.180\n&gt;&gt; All right, so.\n\n25\n00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.780\nLike I said,\nwe're gonna start from the very,\n\n26\n00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.160\nvery beginning of I want to email Lance.\n\n27\n00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.290\nYou're Lance today, right?\n\n28\n00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.223\n&gt;&gt; I am Lance.\n\n29\n00:01:22.223 --> 00:01:27.305\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and I am J.T., so we're putting\non our boy band outfits right now.\n\n30\n00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:28.110\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes we are.\n\n31\n00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.189\n&gt;&gt; Yes we are and so I, as J.T.\n\n32\n00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.455\nhave Lance's email address\nthat I had received from him.\n\n33\n00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:36.220\nMaybe we had a phone call or whatever.\n\n34\n00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.310\nHe's like, here's my email address.\n\n35\n00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.930\nI'm like, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Keep up, keep in touch.\n\n36\n00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.828\n&gt;&gt; Yes, please, yes.\n\n37\n00:01:39.828 --> 00:01:42.531\nWe've definitely got to keep in touch,\nkeep the band together for\n\n38\n00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:44.350\nthat reunion tour that we're going to do.\n\n39\n00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.893\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n40\n00:01:44.893 --> 00:01:46.710\n&gt;&gt; Gosh I wish so much.\n\n41\n00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.296\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n42\n00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:52.171\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so why don't we go ahead and\nget started here that I have it open.\n\n43\n00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:54.490\nI'm in the mail section of Outlook.\n\n44\n00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.250\nAnd I want to start a new email.\n\n45\n00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.560\nI'm on the Home tab of the ribbon, so I'm\njust gonna go ahead and click New Email.\n\n46\n00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.170\nNow the biggest thing to notice\nwhen you start getting into doing\n\n47\n00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.160\na lot of emailing,\nyou've really got to watch your windows.\n\n48\n00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.070\nThat's like the biggest thing that\nI've noticed in working in Outlook,\n\n49\n00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.144\nis your window management and\nwhere are you.\n\n50\n00:02:14.144 --> 00:02:15.222\nWhat window am I in?\n\n51\n00:02:15.222 --> 00:02:18.200\nAnd there's gonna be multiple ones,\nespecially if you're sending lots of\n\n52\n00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.440\ndifferent emails at the same time,\nand you're forwarding and replying.\n\n53\n00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.370\nSo watching your title bar and\n\n54\n00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.110\nunderstanding where you're at,\nis going to be really important.\n\n55\n00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.220\nSo as you can see that it does\nopen in a new message window.\n\n56\n00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.230\nAnd when I'm in a new message window, I'm\ngoing to have my ribbon across the top.\n\n57\n00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.040\nIt's gonna be different than my\nribbon back over here on this screen.\n\n58\n00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.410\nOr in this window of Outlook,\nOutlook we'll call it, versus my message.\n\n59\n00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.250\nAnd by the way, I just did an Alt+Tab\nto switch between windows,\n\n60\n00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.390\ncuz I like Windows shortcuts.\n\n61\n00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.960\nI love keyboards, so\nwe'll just go with that.\n\n62\n00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.920\nSo I can go ahead and\nlook at here across these ribbons.\n\n63\n00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.510\nNotice I have an insert tab.\n\n64\n00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.570\nThat's new.\n\n65\n00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.560\nI have Options.\n\n66\n00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.200\nI have Format Text.\n\n67\n00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.100\nAnd I have Review.\n\n68\n00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.383\nWe will be going over formatting our\nmessage body in future episodes.\n\n69\n00:03:07.383 --> 00:03:10.435\nBut for right now, we are just going\nto concentrate on just like a few quick\n\n70\n00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:13.600\nlittle lines of hey, how's it going,\nand we are going to send and receive.\n\n71\n00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.050\nSo I am going to go back onto that message\ntab that we always start off with.\n\n72\n00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.240\nOne other thing I might\nas well go ahead and\n\n73\n00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.850\npoint out right now, is that the file tab,\nor the back stage view.\n\n74\n00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.880\nThis is going to be a little bit different\nwhen you're in the message window as well.\n\n75\n00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.824\nJust kind of keep where you're at,\nwhat file am I in,\n\n76\n00:03:31.824 --> 00:03:35.164\nwhat backstage am I in,\nwhat window I'm in?\n\n77\n00:03:35.164 --> 00:03:37.481\nAll right, perfect, so let's go ahead and\n\n78\n00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:41.750\njump down into what do we have\ngoing on in this particular window.\n\n79\n00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.260\nI will say if you're looking\nat your window by default,\n\n80\n00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.820\nmine doesn't look the same.\n\n81\n00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.700\nI had left something on from some\nepisodes I did or some testing.\n\n82\n00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.450\nI have a BCC field, so I have a To,\na CC, and a BCC field.\n\n83\n00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.790\nIf you're like, I don't see a BCC field,\nso where's that coming from, I left it on.\n\n84\n00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.009\nIn the options tab, do you see how there's\nan option to add this particular field?\n\n85\n00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:08.750\nWell, I don't even know what it means.\n\n86\n00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.440\nI'll get to the definition\nin just a second.\n\n87\n00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.420\nI just wanted to say that if you're\nfollowing along with your own computer,\n\n88\n00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.421\nyou're gonna first all say I don't,\nwhat's going on?\n\n89\n00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:21.860\nSo I want to clarify that\nright out of the gate.\n\n90\n00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.810\nLet's go back over to message.\n\n91\n00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.480\nSo To,\nthat is who we are addressing it to.\n\n92\n00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.205\nWho am I sending my email to?\n\n93\n00:04:29.205 --> 00:04:31.150\nCC would be carbon copy.\n\n94\n00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.480\nThis is just I am sending this\nas a copy to another person, so\n\n95\n00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.020\nboth people will be able to receive that.\n\n96\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.160\nThat BCC field, that's blind carbon copy.\n\n97\n00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.062\nThat means kind of what it sounds like,\n\n98\n00:04:43.062 --> 00:04:48.160\nit's a blind or\nhidden copy to other recipients.\n\n99\n00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.158\nWe'll talk more about the BCC\nfield in depth in our part two of\n\n100\n00:04:53.158 --> 00:04:57.086\nour email basics show\nthat we're doing right.\n\n101\n00:04:57.086 --> 00:05:00.930\nAnd, of course, we have our subject line,\nwhat we're going to title this.\n\n102\n00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.940\nWe have our Send button, and\nwe have our message body right in here.\n\n103\n00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.980\nSo these are the things,\nit's like a form basically,\n\n104\n00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.180\nthat you need to fill out\nwhen sending an email.\n\n105\n00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.440\nSo let's start with the To.\n\n106\n00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.413\nWho am I sending this to?\n\n107\n00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:14.760\nI'm sending it to Lance.\n\n108\n00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.950\nI have Lance's email written\ndown on a piece of paper.\n\n109\n00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.340\nSo I'm going to go ahead.\n\n110\n00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.940\nI forgot to clear this.\n\n111\n00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.100\n[LAUGHTER] Before I started the show,\nI was trying to get it to where\n\n112\n00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.660\nit wouldn't have what you're\nseeing right now on my screen,\n\n113\n00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.390\nwhich is what's known as auto complete.\n\n114\n00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.920\nIt's actually really nice.\n\n115\n00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.002\nAuto complete list is where if you\nstart sending emails to people and\n\n116\n00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:38.693\nyou're addressing it in the To field,\nOutlook's going to remember it for you.\n\n117\n00:05:38.693 --> 00:05:42.533\nAnd it's going to say hey, that first\nletter, let me give you a list of all\n\n118\n00:05:42.533 --> 00:05:45.930\nthe people that starts with L\nthat you have emailed recently.\n\n119\n00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.020\nIt's really, really handy.\n\n120\n00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.060\nAnd so it's good to have.\n\n121\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.800\nI wanted to demonstrate it\nto where it wasn't there, so\n\n122\n00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.420\nyou could physically type it out.\n\n123\n00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.270\nAnd since you don't really wanna see me\ntyping anyways, cuz I'll probably make\n\n124\n00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.670\nsome mistakes, I am gonna go ahead and\nclick on this right now.\n\n125\n00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.820\nIt is doing something else that it's kinda\n\n126\n00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.410\nchanging where the email address doesn't\nlook like the email address anymore.\n\n127\n00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.240\nIt just says, Lance Bass.\n\n128\n00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.636\nWhat is that going on?\n\n129\n00:06:14.636 --> 00:06:17.287\nHow is that his email address?\n\n130\n00:06:17.287 --> 00:06:21.890\nWell, that's because Lance and J.T.\nwork in the same organization.\n\n131\n00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.259\nWe are all part of Office Pro demo Co and\n\n132\n00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:29.461\nit is set up that we are on our own system\nif you wanna say it, administratively set.\n\n133\n00:06:29.461 --> 00:06:33.402\nSo it's checking the name of Lance and\nsaying yep,\n\n134\n00:06:33.402 --> 00:06:39.270\nthat's verified in our directory of\npeople that work at Office Pro Demo Co,\n\n135\n00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:46.260\nso it's just translating it back into, all\nright, well, Lance's email is Lance Bass.\n\n136\n00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.420\nSo it's doing all of those\nthings automatically,\n\n137\n00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.740\nbecause I've already been using Outlook\nfor a while here and testing things out.\n\n138\n00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.810\nSo let's say if you're in your company and\nyou're in a large organization,\n\n139\n00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.820\nyou start typing in somebody's name, I see\nit in the auto complete, then it changes,\n\n140\n00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.670\nat least you know what's\ngoing on when that happens.\n\n141\n00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.880\nSo it's very common, it will always\nhappen in larger organizations.\n\n142\n00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.315\nSo that's how we do it.\n\n143\n00:07:12.315 --> 00:07:15.805\nI want to go ahead and\ndo a quick little off to the side,\n\n144\n00:07:15.805 --> 00:07:17.595\na little,\n&gt;&gt; Tangent?\n\n145\n00:07:17.595 --> 00:07:18.614\n&gt;&gt; Squirrel.\n\n146\n00:07:18.614 --> 00:07:22.479\nBecause I feel this is a good place\nto show you that auto complete,\n\n147\n00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:26.204\nthis is what I was supposed to do\nbefore I started this episode,\n\n148\n00:07:26.204 --> 00:07:30.060\nwas I wanted to actually clear\nout that auto complete list.\n\n149\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.600\nSo that way, it doesn't remember anything.\n\n150\n00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.230\nIt's like clearing a cache, basically.\n\n151\n00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.489\nDon't remember anything that I've typed.\n\n152\n00:07:37.489 --> 00:07:40.103\nAnd this is also a good demonstration\nof like, you know what,\n\n153\n00:07:40.103 --> 00:07:42.090\nI wasn't really ready to email Lance.\n\n154\n00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:46.240\nSo I wanna close this message window,\nthat I started,\n\n155\n00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.670\nand it's going to automatically prompt me,\nwell hey, guess what?\n\n156\n00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.770\nYou're starting something.\n\n157\n00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.810\nDo you want me to save this for\nyou and come back later?\n\n158\n00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.717\nFor this example we're just gonna say no.\n\n159\n00:07:55.717 --> 00:07:57.543\nWe're gonna say I don't\nwant you to save anything.\n\n160\n00:07:57.543 --> 00:08:01.292\nI kind of just kind of messed up a little\nbit, so we're just gonna say no and\n\n161\n00:08:01.292 --> 00:08:02.730\nclear that out.\n\n162\n00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.990\nSo let me show you where that\nauto complete list is located.\n\n163\n00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.840\nIt is in the Options.\n\n164\n00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.290\nSo back in Outlook, I'm gonna go to File.\n\n165\n00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:14.188\nI am going to go to Options,\nand I am going to go to Mail.\n\n166\n00:08:14.188 --> 00:08:18.792\nYou're gonna see us going over into the\noptions throughout these episodes a lot.\n\n167\n00:08:18.792 --> 00:08:24.019\nBecause there are a lot of options\nthat you can set within Outlook,\n\n168\n00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:25.615\nI mean tons of them.\n\n169\n00:08:25.615 --> 00:08:30.103\nSo we're going to kind of meander our way\nthrough these long lists of options as we\n\n170\n00:08:30.103 --> 00:08:30.834\ngo through.\n\n171\n00:08:30.834 --> 00:08:33.715\nAnd I'm I'm gonna point out\nthe ones that I think that\n\n172\n00:08:33.715 --> 00:08:35.075\nare the most important to point out.\n\n173\n00:08:35.075 --> 00:08:36.725\nSo, I'm gonna scroll on down here.\n\n174\n00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:38.475\nI'm in the mail section.\n\n175\n00:08:38.475 --> 00:08:41.145\nAnd right there,\nwhere it says empty auto complete list,\n\n176\n00:08:41.145 --> 00:08:44.795\nthis is where it's staying at\nthe suggest names as we type.\n\n177\n00:08:44.795 --> 00:08:47.815\nReally great, but for this particular\ndemonstration, we're going to say yes,\n\n178\n00:08:47.815 --> 00:08:49.465\nI want to empty this out.\n\n179\n00:08:49.465 --> 00:08:50.496\nI'm going to click OK.\n\n180\n00:08:50.496 --> 00:08:52.095\nBecause maybe it's actually,\n\n181\n00:08:52.095 --> 00:08:56.450\nI've actually had to do this where it's\nremembering emails that were wrong.\n\n182\n00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:02.230\nOr that weren't applicable anymore,\n\n183\n00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.140\nbecause maybe that person's email changed,\nand it's just keeping our memory.\n\n184\n00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:09.325\nSo it's good I think to know where it's\nat, to know where we know how to clear.\n\n185\n00:09:09.325 --> 00:09:11.363\nAll right, [SOUND] so\nlet's start over now Ronnie [LAUGH].\n\n186\n00:09:11.363 --> 00:09:12.600\n&gt;&gt; Well, sounds good.\n\n187\n00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.580\n&gt;&gt; Let's go back to New Email.\n\n188\n00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:22.790\nAnd we're going to type in\nlance@officeprodemoco.onmicrosoft.com.\n\n189\n00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.800\nOops, see, look at that Ronnie.\n\n190\n00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.410\nI always do that, micro, micru?\n\n191\n00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.920\nMicrosoft, I think that's right [LAUGH].\n\n192\n00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:40.830\nSo I've typed in my email address,\nand that is Lance's email, perfect.\n\n193\n00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.730\nI'm not going to carbon copy anybody,\n\n194\n00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:46.060\nbecause we said we're just doing\na single recipient of send and receive.\n\n195\n00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.660\nSome I'm gonna type in a subject.\n\n196\n00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:52.030\nI'm going to say, first email of the day,\n\n197\n00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.320\nwhich is really not true, but\nwe're gonna pretend it is [LAUGH].\n\n198\n00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.250\nOf the episode, how about that?\n\n199\n00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.050\nEpisode.\n\n200\n00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:01.830\nAnd then I'm gonna say, hi Lance.\n\n201\n00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.480\nWhat is your favorite color?\n\n202\n00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.270\nSo we're just gonna go with color today,\nokay?\n\n203\n00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.600\nI know that, why don't we do another one?\n\n204\n00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:20.710\nWhat is you're favorite, you're?\n\n205\n00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.130\nYour favorite animal.\n\n206\n00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.360\nWow, all right.\n\n207\n00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:29.030\nAs you can see, when people look at\nme typing, I type really poorly.\n\n208\n00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.980\nAnimal, but it does bring up that red\nsquigglies, what does that mean, Ronnie?\n\n209\n00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.242\n&gt;&gt; Means there's a misspelling somewhere.\n\n210\n00:10:34.242 --> 00:10:38.283\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes, and we'll be going over\nlots of auto formatting as you type in\n\n211\n00:10:38.283 --> 00:10:39.852\nauto correcting as you type.\n\n212\n00:10:39.852 --> 00:10:44.018\nAnd I keep wanting to say previous,\nfuture episodes.\n\n213\n00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:48.370\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, but before we move\non from here, the email address,\n\n214\n00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:49.450\nthat looks a little bit funny.\n\n215\n00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.741\nWhat's that about?\n\n216\n00:10:50.741 --> 00:10:53.417\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, so with email addresses,\n\n217\n00:10:53.417 --> 00:10:58.160\nbecause you don't necessarily always\nsee double dots, as I call it.\n\n218\n00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.570\nBut it's completely valid.\n\n219\n00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.644\nThe way that email addresses\nwork is whatever's in the front,\n\n220\n00:11:02.644 --> 00:11:03.863\nthat's like your name.\n\n221\n00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:07.440\nAnd you could have underscores,\nyou can have dots,\n\n222\n00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.302\nyou could have Von.Smith.OfficePro.\n\n223\n00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:14.750\nI mean anything that comes in the front\nis just your username, if you wanna say.\n\n224\n00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.580\nAnd the at,\n\n225\n00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:22.100\nthe at means where you're going to that's\nthe next domain, the domain level.\n\n226\n00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:27.500\nAn officeprodemoco.onmicrosoft.com,\nthose are the domains.\n\n227\n00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.925\nNow the .com,\nthat's your top level domain.\n\n228\n00:11:29.925 --> 00:11:33.170\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And then the OfficeProdemo.co,\n\n229\n00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:39.333\nthat's a domain that's part of Microsoft,\nso it's almost a subdivision.\n\n230\n00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:45.290\nThe top top, and then topest,\nI know topest is not the word.\n\n231\n00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:46.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Peak.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, peak [LAUGH].\n\n232\n00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:51.950\nI tend to make up est words on things that\naren't supposed to have est's on there.\n\n233\n00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:56.090\nSo, but that's the kind of\nthe composition of an email address.\n\n234\n00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:59.340\nAnd that sometimes if you\nmisspell a domain, or\n\n235\n00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.960\nyou misspell a user,\nyou're gonna get undeliverable warnings,\n\n236\n00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.070\nwhich I've actually recreated\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n237\n00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:10.040\nI'm going to demonstrate in parts of these\nepisodes as well, to kind of show you,\n\n238\n00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.640\nmaking sure you have the right\naddress is going to be important.\n\n239\n00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.597\nIt's like when you were using a telephone,\nyou dial the wrong number, that [SOUND].\n\n240\n00:12:17.597 --> 00:12:21.900\nAnd the operator's like I can't connect,\nso it can't understand it.\n\n241\n00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:26.350\nSo great point Ronnie, and something\nelse has happened in that to field.\n\n242\n00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.380\nIt's underlined.\n\n243\n00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.850\nIt is.\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n244\n00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:30.660\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n\n245\n00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.460\nIf you have an underline,\n\n246\n00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:37.780\nwhat it's doing is Outlook is checking\nthat looks like a valid email address.\n\n247\n00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.120\nNow, it's not proofing for\nspelling mistakes.\n\n248\n00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.580\nIf I put in Lance with 3 A's,\nit's going to still say,\n\n249\n00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.720\nyeah that looks like\na valid email address.\n\n250\n00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.653\nAnd everything's fine.\n\n251\n00:12:48.653 --> 00:12:50.886\nNow if we're on the same network,\n\n252\n00:12:50.886 --> 00:12:55.590\ncuz Lance is in our Active Directory\nof our company of Office Pro Demo Co.\n\n253\n00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:02.800\nIt should detect that things are wrong\nin the user name, but not always.\n\n254\n00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.322\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if it can find it, right?\n\n255\n00:13:04.322 --> 00:13:07.998\nSo in other words, if it's already\nexisting, the format that it is in,\n\n256\n00:13:07.998 --> 00:13:12.122\nit will automatically go ahead and check\nand verify that everything is correct.\n\n257\n00:13:12.122 --> 00:13:16.550\nIf it's not, it may tell you, hey I can't\nthis, and that might let you know that\n\n258\n00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:20.565\neither you've mistyped, or\nhe's not currently a part of that domain.\n\n259\n00:13:20.565 --> 00:13:21.210\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n260\n00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.350\n&gt;&gt; So you may get some different options.\n\n261\n00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.932\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n262\n00:13:23.932 --> 00:13:28.150\nthis is the perfect place to point\nout the Check Name button right here.\n\n263\n00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:31.590\nCuz when I'm getting ready to send it,\nI don't wanna send mistakes.\n\n264\n00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:33.070\nSo yes, I would definitely proof my email,\n\n265\n00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:34.610\nmake sure I don't have\nany spelling mistakes.\n\n266\n00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.907\nBut I should proof to make\nsure that the name exist, or\n\n267\n00:13:37.907 --> 00:13:40.563\nthe email address is in the proper format.\n\n268\n00:13:40.563 --> 00:13:43.906\nLike I didn't forget the @ sign,\nor I didn't forget the .com, or\n\n269\n00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:47.620\nthe dot between the com, and the other\ndomain so, the check names is good.\n\n270\n00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:51.960\nAnd if I say, now it's already checked\nit because it does underline it.\n\n271\n00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.780\nAnd I would do this a lot when I was\nsending emails to multiple people within\n\n272\n00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.530\nmy organization,\nI would always clicked that checked names.\n\n273\n00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:02.012\nIf I didn't see underlines on some people,\nsomething is wrong.\n\n274\n00:14:02.012 --> 00:14:03.910\nSo I clicked on their name, but\n\n275\n00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.490\nclicking on their name means I\ncan go ahead and click here.\n\n276\n00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:10.320\nAnd it would usually go ahead and\npop up, see right there.\n\n277\n00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.740\nIt will go ahead and pull something up.\n\n278\n00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.060\nEspecially if I'm in\nthe same organization.\n\n279\n00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.301\nIf it didn't pull something up or\nyes, this is valid,\n\n280\n00:14:17.301 --> 00:14:20.549\nI need to make sure I'm sending\nit to the right person.\n\n281\n00:14:20.549 --> 00:14:21.421\nRight, great,\n\n282\n00:14:21.421 --> 00:14:25.592\nall these great features of just sending\nan email to always be checking for.\n\n283\n00:14:25.592 --> 00:14:28.200\nThings that you might just kind\nof overlook here and there.\n\n284\n00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.250\nBut since we're kind of really diving into\nthe basics and getting a good foundation,\n\n285\n00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.060\nthese are all the things you\nneed to start being aware of.\n\n286\n00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.860\nSo I feel like my email is finished.\n\n287\n00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.980\nI have a person, I have a subject.\n\n288\n00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.240\nAlways make that subject line.\n\n289\n00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.250\nDo you know how many emails\nI've gotten that are blank?\n\n290\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:44.780\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n291\n00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:45.640\n&gt;&gt; I've done it too.\n\n292\n00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.410\nSo it's, you should always try to title,\nand give it a proper title.\n\n293\n00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:54.310\nCuz, when you start getting\ninto how people search for\n\n294\n00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:58.060\nthings, having a good title\nit will be important.\n\n295\n00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:02.480\nIt will come in to play later\ndown the road for you and for\n\n296\n00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.535\nyour recipients, so\nit's good to have that.\n\n297\n00:15:04.535 --> 00:15:07.590\n&gt;&gt; Von, speaking of that subject line,\nit's really important\n\n298\n00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:12.160\nnow that we do add in subject lines and\ndescriptive subject lines as we can.\n\n299\n00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:18.770\nThe reason why is a lot of times in the\nbackground when your email server itself.\n\n300\n00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.420\nIt might look and\ngo it doesn't have a subject line.\n\n301\n00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.318\nI'm going to automatically\nshoot that over to spam.\n\n302\n00:15:23.318 --> 00:15:23.886\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n303\n00:15:23.886 --> 00:15:28.280\nit's because of the way that malware\nworks and some other different things.\n\n304\n00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.460\nSo normally putting in a subject line,\n\n305\n00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.760\nit might be something that really at least\nallows your matches to even be delivered.\n\n306\n00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.930\n&gt;&gt; That's a great point, Ronnie.\n\n307\n00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.160\nYeah, I totally forgot\nabout something like that.\n\n308\n00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.760\nAnd if you're writing a title\nthat's kinda spammy [LAUGH]\n\n309\n00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you gotta be careful.\n\n310\n00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:47.780\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna sound like\nthose phishing type of emails,\n\n311\n00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.354\nbecause yeah,\nit does read your subject lines.\n\n312\n00:15:50.354 --> 00:15:51.172\n&gt;&gt; Your keywords.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n313\n00:15:51.172 --> 00:15:54.128\nAnd it's like okay, nope,\nwe're going over to spam.\n\n314\n00:15:54.128 --> 00:15:56.140\nWe have a whole episode about spam and\njunk mail.\n\n315\n00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.840\nSo we'll go ahead and\naddress that when we get down the line.\n\n316\n00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.810\nAll right, perfect so I think I'm good,\nI'm gonna go ahead and send this off.\n\n317\n00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:07.612\nSo I click on the Send button Notice\nhow my message window closed.\n\n318\n00:16:07.612 --> 00:16:08.750\nIt's like, okay, you're done composing.\n\n319\n00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.380\nSo my message is closed, and there I go.\n\n320\n00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.630\nDid I, did I misspell this?\n\n321\n00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.997\nI did, didn't I?\n\n322\n00:16:15.997 --> 00:16:16.608\nOkay, well.\n\n323\n00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:19.655\n[LAUGH] I already got\nan undeliverable message.\n\n324\n00:16:19.655 --> 00:16:21.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I thought I had proofed it and\n\n325\n00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.240\neverything was great.\n\n326\n00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.120\nSo, well, you know what?\n\n327\n00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.021\nBest time to go ahead and look at this.\n\n328\n00:16:27.021 --> 00:16:31.795\nOkay, let's go ahead and\nI'm going to open this and\n\n329\n00:16:31.795 --> 00:16:37.894\nit says that your\nofficelanceatofficeprodemocothatonmy.\n\n330\n00:16:37.894 --> 00:16:41.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n331\n00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.260\nAll right you know, teachable moment.\n\n332\n00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.220\nI did the check name and\nit was like yep, it's valid.\n\n333\n00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.140\nBut I did notice one thing.\n\n334\n00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.680\nIt didn't turn to Lance Bass.\n\n335\n00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.209\n&gt;&gt; It did not.\n&gt;&gt; It didn't turn to its name that's in\n\n336\n00:16:53.209 --> 00:16:58.064\nthe directory of this email as associated\nwith Lance Bass, so it didn't turn over.\n\n337\n00:16:58.064 --> 00:17:01.751\nI actually I thought about it and\nwent [NOISE] keep going.\n\n338\n00:17:01.751 --> 00:17:06.130\nSo it's fine, but see right here,\ngood as point as any.\n\n339\n00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.036\nI can mess up too.\n\n340\n00:17:07.036 --> 00:17:08.200\nYou can all mess up.\n\n341\n00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.040\nIt happens.\n\n342\n00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:14.520\nBut this is nice that it is telling\nme that something's wrong here and\n\n343\n00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.620\nI can't find it.\n\n344\n00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.800\nThe domain doesn't exist.\n\n345\n00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.230\nSo reading your error messages.\n\n346\n00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:21.550\nIt's really helpful.\n\n347\n00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.026\nAnd I had to look at it.\n\n348\n00:17:23.026 --> 00:17:24.380\nI looked at it three times.\n\n349\n00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.297\nI think you saw it too.\n\n350\n00:17:25.297 --> 00:17:26.639\nYeah, duh, this look totally fine.\n\n351\n00:17:26.639 --> 00:17:29.610\nOr maybe you saw it too and\ndidn't tell me, Ronnie.\n\n352\n00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:30.791\n&gt;&gt; I actually couldn't read it.\n\n353\n00:17:30.791 --> 00:17:33.244\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was too far away from the screen\n\n354\n00:17:33.244 --> 00:17:33.773\nto see.\n\n355\n00:17:33.773 --> 00:17:35.454\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's true.\n\n356\n00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:41.330\n&gt;&gt; All right, well anyways,\nreal life situation, right here.\n\n357\n00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.712\nThat I have delivered an email\nthat was not correct.\n\n358\n00:17:44.712 --> 00:17:49.290\nAnd this is another thing where it's\ntelling me it didn't get out of the gate.\n\n359\n00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.470\nIt was undeliverable.\n\n360\n00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.340\nSo now I need to go ahead and\nsay, let's try it again.\n\n361\n00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.924\nAll right, so\nthis time we're gonna go ahead and\n\n362\n00:17:56.924 --> 00:18:00.783\ndo Lance Bass, but see,\nthat's that autocomplete where it's wrong.\n\n363\n00:18:00.783 --> 00:18:04.891\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and choose it,\nand then just go ahead and\n\n364\n00:18:04.891 --> 00:18:07.583\nthen proof it to where it's Microsoft.\n\n365\n00:18:07.583 --> 00:18:11.039\nYou know what, I forgot, when we do this,\n\n366\n00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:16.629\nit can't get back into it, so\nyou know what, let's start all over.\n\n367\n00:18:16.629 --> 00:18:22.150\nLance@Officeprodemoco.onmicrosoft.\n\n368\n00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:23.167\nI spelled it wrong, again.\n\n369\n00:18:23.167 --> 00:18:23.839\nMy goodness gracious.\n\n370\n00:18:23.839 --> 00:18:26.848\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft.\n\n371\n00:18:26.848 --> 00:18:28.290\nYou all are loving this.\n\n372\n00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.103\nOkay, let's go ahead and\ncheck the name right now.\n\n373\n00:18:30.103 --> 00:18:30.711\nThere we go.\n\n374\n00:18:30.711 --> 00:18:31.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Success.\n\n375\n00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.550\n[LAUGH] Lance exists.\n\n376\n00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:40.574\nOkay, we're going to say email for you.\n\n377\n00:18:40.574 --> 00:18:42.850\nNot very descriptive title is it.\n\n378\n00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:46.300\nOkay, hello favorite animal.\n\n379\n00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.292\nSo I'm just gonna keep it short and\nsimple, done.\n\n380\n00:18:50.292 --> 00:18:55.072\n[LAUGH] Let's go ahead and\nhit that send button.\n\n381\n00:18:55.072 --> 00:18:56.610\nI think we're okay.\n\n382\n00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.775\nAnd I also actually saw a status.\n\n383\n00:18:58.775 --> 00:19:01.400\nThat status bar is a good\nplace to look at too.\n\n384\n00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.335\nI saw it kind of pop up.\n\n385\n00:19:02.335 --> 00:19:03.540\nYep, we're good.\n\n386\n00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.243\nWhile I'm doing this and\nwhile Ronnie, or I'm sorry, Lance.\n\n387\n00:19:07.243 --> 00:19:10.351\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Lance is responding to my email.\n\n388\n00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:12.478\nLet's go ahead and\ncheck out that sent items.\n\n389\n00:19:12.478 --> 00:19:13.563\nCuz I have to do that a lot.\n\n390\n00:19:13.563 --> 00:19:14.873\nDid I send that email?\n\n391\n00:19:14.873 --> 00:19:15.901\nDid that go out?\n\n392\n00:19:15.901 --> 00:19:20.365\nLet me check my sent items, because my\ninbox is for my inbox, my sent is for\n\n393\n00:19:20.365 --> 00:19:20.950\nmy sent.\n\n394\n00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.860\nExactly.\n\n395\n00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:27.188\nSo if I go into my sent items,\nnotice right here in today at this\n\n396\n00:19:27.188 --> 00:19:31.040\nparticular time, yes,\nI have addressed it to Lance.\n\n397\n00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:31.823\nHere is my title.\n\n398\n00:19:31.823 --> 00:19:35.090\nThis is the time of when I sent it,\nand the date.\n\n399\n00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.710\nI verify it did go out.\n\n400\n00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.780\nI'm happy, everything is working.\n\n401\n00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.500\nOkay, so your sent items is\nalways a good place to check\n\n402\n00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.740\nto see what you actually did.\n\n403\n00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.950\nAnd actually behind my head you can\nsee that something just popped up.\n\n404\n00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:49.440\nThis is a good little indication\nwhen you're working in Outlook.\n\n405\n00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.703\nIt's just like a little message.\n\n406\n00:19:50.703 --> 00:19:52.530\nLike, hey, guess what,\nyou've got an email.\n\n407\n00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:57.340\nBecause I might be off doing something\nin Excel, or off into another program.\n\n408\n00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.930\nAnd it will just pop up\non top of everything.\n\n409\n00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:01.110\nHey, you got a message.\n\n410\n00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:04.860\nAnd I could click on that, and it could\nactually open up that message right away.\n\n411\n00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.513\nNow, Outlook does have to be running.\n\n412\n00:20:08.513 --> 00:20:11.513\nSo when I'm working,\nespecially back at the university,\n\n413\n00:20:11.513 --> 00:20:13.254\nOutlook was open the entire time.\n\n414\n00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:16.446\nI would minimize it, then kind of\nemail as I needed to go to, but\n\n415\n00:20:16.446 --> 00:20:18.677\nit's always kind of in the background, and\n\n416\n00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:22.918\nthose little pop-up messages would really\nhelp me know when things are coming in.\n\n417\n00:20:22.918 --> 00:20:26.409\nAll right, so\nlet's go back into that inbox,\n\n418\n00:20:26.409 --> 00:20:29.641\ncuz now I have received\na reply from Lance.\n\n419\n00:20:29.641 --> 00:20:32.242\nHow do I know that it's a reply\nto an email that I sent.\n\n420\n00:20:32.242 --> 00:20:35.976\nIn that subject line it says RE and\nright now it's bold,\n\n421\n00:20:35.976 --> 00:20:38.900\nbecause I haven't read it yet.\n\n422\n00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:39.770\nI'm gonna click on it.\n\n423\n00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:43.836\nNow I'm single clicking on this right now,\nbecause how you respond and\n\n424\n00:20:43.836 --> 00:20:47.716\nreply to your messages really depends on,\nwell, where are you at?\n\n425\n00:20:47.716 --> 00:20:50.957\nThere's a lot of different\nways you can reply.\n\n426\n00:20:50.957 --> 00:20:52.721\nI have the reading pane opened and\n\n427\n00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:56.630\nthat's my configuration with the view\nthat I want Outlook to be in.\n\n428\n00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:01.552\nAnd so in the reading pane, I can see\nthat this is the email I have from me, so\n\n429\n00:21:01.552 --> 00:21:03.443\nI have my original message.\n\n430\n00:21:03.443 --> 00:21:05.510\nI have the reply on top.\n\n431\n00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:08.020\nAnd then I can see that Lance says thanks,\nyou're the best.\n\n432\n00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.690\nThanks.\n\n433\n00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.300\nYou like otters.\n\n434\n00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.520\nCute little otters, that's adorable.\n\n435\n00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.497\nSo now, I want to respond back to Lance.\n\n436\n00:21:17.497 --> 00:21:19.530\nLots of different ways I could do this.\n\n437\n00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:20.528\nBut it's all the same thing.\n\n438\n00:21:20.528 --> 00:21:22.060\nRight, it all gets to the same place.\n\n439\n00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:27.150\nIn the reading pane, I could click\nthe reply button right here and\n\n440\n00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:31.210\nI can reply within this reading pane.\n\n441\n00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:32.310\nI could also go ahead and\n\n442\n00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:36.740\nclick the reply button up here\non the ribbon in the Home tab.\n\n443\n00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:44.960\nOr I could also open the reply in its\nown window and then reply from there.\n\n444\n00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.810\nSo let’s go with the first\none that I talked about.\n\n445\n00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:49.408\nLet’s reply within the reading pane.\n\n446\n00:21:49.408 --> 00:21:51.880\nBecause we going to like do\nquick little back and forth.\n\n447\n00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.143\nSo I click reply and\nit stays within the reading pane.\n\n448\n00:21:55.143 --> 00:21:57.880\nIt doesn't open up in a new window.\n\n449\n00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.540\nAnd then I have here,\nthat I could go ahead and work with it and\n\n450\n00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:05.430\nstill work from within this contextual\ntab that just popped up on our ribbon,\n\n451\n00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.050\nthat's talking about compose tools.\n\n452\n00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.870\nAnd I can use my messages, and\nI can attach things, and I can do\n\n453\n00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:14.450\neverything from the ribbon right from\nwithin Outlook and not open a new window.\n\n454\n00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:16.610\nTotally fine, totally works.\n\n455\n00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:20.430\nBut if I'm thinking I want to kind of\ngive myself a little bit more space,\n\n456\n00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:21.670\nlittle bit more room.\n\n457\n00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:24.250\nSometimes it's like, it's almost\nlike I want a bigger piece of paper.\n\n458\n00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:29.630\nYou could pop out the message from\nthe reading pane out into a new window.\n\n459\n00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.270\nLet's do that.\n\n460\n00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.230\nLet's go ahead and pop this out.\n\n461\n00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:35.768\nNow it's opened up in the same\nplace that I was at, so\n\n462\n00:22:35.768 --> 00:22:38.151\nI could have started typing\nIn the reading pane.\n\n463\n00:22:38.151 --> 00:22:42.590\nAnd let me go ahead and bring this out,\ncuz I wanna just want more real estate.\n\n464\n00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:46.030\nPop it out, it keeps everything in there,\nand then you continue on typing.\n\n465\n00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:48.870\nAnd I'll be like, I like bunnies.\n\n466\n00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.671\nWow, I am just doing so\ngreat with typing today.\n\n467\n00:22:53.671 --> 00:22:54.810\nI like bunnies.\n\n468\n00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:58.890\nSo now I'm replying and\nI would like to go ahead and send this.\n\n469\n00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:00.490\nSo I click Send.\n\n470\n00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:06.932\nAnd that's gone off, and now I've\nstarted this conversation with Lance.\n\n471\n00:23:06.932 --> 00:23:09.330\nAnd so we can go back and forth and talk.\n\n472\n00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:10.410\nI can double-check.\n\n473\n00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:12.020\nDid I send this out?\n\n474\n00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.030\nAnd here we go.\n\n475\n00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:16.480\nAnd I've already mentioned\nthe word conversation.\n\n476\n00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.561\nThere's a reason why\nI'm popping that up or\n\n477\n00:23:18.561 --> 00:23:21.890\nbringing this out in this conversation\nthat we're having right now.\n\n478\n00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:26.761\nIt's because if I start going back and\nforth with Lance, we might be back and\n\n479\n00:23:26.761 --> 00:23:31.252\nforth on this particular subject of\nemail for you, since I titled it so\n\n480\n00:23:31.252 --> 00:23:33.180\nappropriately.\n\n481\n00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:38.900\nFor maybe today, for a couple days and\nI wanna keep the whole thread.\n\n482\n00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:43.714\nI call them threads, and I think they\ndo actually refer in the terminology of\n\n483\n00:23:43.714 --> 00:23:48.400\na thread, of all the different\nways we have communicated.\n\n484\n00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.170\nAnd that's something we're\ngoing to show in the view.\n\n485\n00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:56.057\nI figure I'll just get one more email\nback from Lance to be able to show it.\n\n486\n00:23:56.057 --> 00:24:00.258\nBut I'm gonna just show you while we're\ngoing through this on the View tab\n\n487\n00:24:00.258 --> 00:24:01.970\nThat show as conversations.\n\n488\n00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:04.729\nI have friends that can't\nstand conversations.\n\n489\n00:24:04.729 --> 00:24:06.610\nThey're like I do not like\nto have conversations.\n\n490\n00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:12.410\nI want everything to be email,\nemail, email, email, totally fine.\n\n491\n00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:13.761\nI prefer, I like it.\n\n492\n00:24:13.761 --> 00:24:17.477\nI really like to have conversations cuz\nit keeps it, it's just organization,\n\n493\n00:24:17.477 --> 00:24:19.840\nit's just a different way of grouping.\n\n494\n00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:24.045\nSo you can say, that bunnies,\nthey're vicious animals yes.\n\n495\n00:24:24.045 --> 00:24:26.850\n[LAUGH] It's just a wee rabbit right?\n\n496\n00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:30.558\n[LAUGH] So yes, they can be I guess,\nbut they're really adorable too.\n\n497\n00:24:30.558 --> 00:24:33.550\nSo I've gotten a couple things back and\nforth.\n\n498\n00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:37.210\nSo let's go back over here,\nwell I'm already here, to the view tab and\n\n499\n00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:39.280\nshow as conversations.\n\n500\n00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.950\nNotice I am in my inbox right now,\njust pointing that out.\n\n501\n00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:46.760\nI'm gonna click on show as conversations\nand it's saying, do you wanna do this for\n\n502\n00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.940\nall of your mailboxes?\n\n503\n00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.060\nYou're like, well I have one.\n\n504\n00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.970\nWell, this means like your sent items.\n\n505\n00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:55.950\nIt means multiple mailboxes and multiple\nfolders like, everything that you do in\n\n506\n00:24:55.950 --> 00:25:00.250\nOutlook because you might configure\nyour inbox to show as conversations.\n\n507\n00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.580\nBut you sent to not show us conversations.\n\n508\n00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:04.690\nTotally up to you.\n\n509\n00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:07.650\nI'm going to go ahead and\njust go with this folder for now, and\n\n510\n00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:09.060\nI'm going to click OK.\n\n511\n00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:14.301\nAnd notice that this particular\nemail subject, of email for\n\n512\n00:25:14.301 --> 00:25:19.964\nyou it turns into a little triangle\nthat is next to Lance's name.\n\n513\n00:25:19.964 --> 00:25:21.607\nAnd if I expand this out,\n\n514\n00:25:21.607 --> 00:25:27.290\nit's showing me all the different things\nthat I have done within this conversation.\n\n515\n00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:31.420\nI can see that I started\nit with the sent item.\n\n516\n00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.010\nAnd then Lance responds.\n\n517\n00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:34.410\nAnd then I responded.\n\n518\n00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.070\nAnd then Lance responds.\n\n519\n00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.520\nAnd so I can keep everything in there.\n\n520\n00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.870\nAnd this might go on, I mean,\nI have conversations that go across weeks,\n\n521\n00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:45.920\nmonths because we're talking\nabout that same subject matter.\n\n522\n00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:51.360\nSo it's like, all in one little section\nfrom me that I can collapse and\n\n523\n00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.450\nI can expand and I can kinda just\nkeep it the way that I want to do it.\n\n524\n00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:58.360\nNow, if you don't wanna show\nthis as conversations anymore.\n\n525\n00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:03.410\nIf I uncheck this, it's basically just\ngoing to ungroup if you wanna say.\n\n526\n00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.984\nAnd I could say not in this folder or,\nfor now,\n\n527\n00:26:05.984 --> 00:26:08.697\nI do wanna keep it in conversations but\nI can't.\n\n528\n00:26:08.697 --> 00:26:14.587\nSo I just wanted to show you that you\ncould always take it out of conversations,\n\n529\n00:26:14.587 --> 00:26:16.830\nif you ever wanted to do that.\n\n530\n00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.390\nSo that's perfect, wonderful.\n\n531\n00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:23.175\nSo I've got the send and\nreceive, we have conversations,\n\n532\n00:26:23.175 --> 00:26:26.970\nthe other thing that I wanted\nto start here is attachments.\n\n533\n00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:30.885\nBecause sometimes when we're\ntalking to each other,\n\n534\n00:26:30.885 --> 00:26:35.150\nI need to do more than just send\nsomething in the email body.\n\n535\n00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.319\nMaybe I have a report that\nI need to send somebody,\n\n536\n00:26:38.319 --> 00:26:42.180\nmaybe I need to show them a picture\nof the bunnies that I like.\n\n537\n00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:45.085\nI don't have any pictures of bunnies,\nbut I have pictures of cats.\n\n538\n00:26:45.085 --> 00:26:49.378\n[LAUGH] So maybe I'd like to send\nyou a picture of Fuego and Bishop.\n\n539\n00:26:49.378 --> 00:26:51.250\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n&gt;&gt; All right I'm going to do that for you.\n\n540\n00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:54.420\nSo I'm gonna go back to home,\nI'm in my inbox, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n541\n00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:55.820\nclick new email.\n\n542\n00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:56.880\nAnd I'm going to,\n\n543\n00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.399\nthis is right here that auto complete of\nI wanna make sure I'm doing to right one.\n\n544\n00:27:01.399 --> 00:27:04.830\nOffice, Pro, Demo, Co on Microsoft, yes.\n\n545\n00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:07.526\nAnd I can always do my check mail,\nwe're good.\n\n546\n00:27:07.526 --> 00:27:12.645\nAnd I'm going to say of photo of kitties.\n\n547\n00:27:12.645 --> 00:27:17.854\n[LAUGH] I can already tell that this\nshow is going to be lots of like,\n\n548\n00:27:17.854 --> 00:27:20.719\nhow is Ron going to mistype things?\n\n549\n00:27:20.719 --> 00:27:23.101\n[LAUGH] So photos of kitties and\nI should probably go ahead and\n\n550\n00:27:23.101 --> 00:27:24.730\ncapitalize my first words of sentence.\n\n551\n00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:27.560\nIt's a kind of bad habit\nI've kind of gotten into.\n\n552\n00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.990\nIt's Word, and all those auto-correct\nthings that it's been doing for so long.\n\n553\n00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:33.176\n&gt;&gt; And your phone, your smartphone, yeah.\n\n554\n00:27:33.176 --> 00:27:36.950\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and\nyeah I do it all the time, like stop.\n\n555\n00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:43.820\nSo all right, so for you, how am I\ngoing to attach a photo to this email?\n\n556\n00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:47.046\nThere is right in the message\nthere is attach file.\n\n557\n00:27:47.046 --> 00:27:52.339\nThere's also attach item, but that gets\ninto items that were within Outlook,\n\n558\n00:27:52.339 --> 00:27:55.505\nso as you can see business cards and\ncalendars.\n\n559\n00:27:55.505 --> 00:27:58.936\nSo I don't want to go with\nthat particular attachment and\n\n560\n00:27:58.936 --> 00:28:02.160\nthe paperclip of like\nattaching this to a file, wow!\n\n561\n00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.720\nOkay, [LAUGH] that was\na great description.\n\n562\n00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.050\nI think it's kind of self explanatory.\n\n563\n00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:10.818\nThe nice thing about here is that it will\ngive me a list of some of my recently used\n\n564\n00:28:10.818 --> 00:28:12.717\nitems or commonly used files.\n\n565\n00:28:12.717 --> 00:28:16.850\nI don't have a lot of files\non this computer right now.\n\n566\n00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:19.520\nSo it's kind of showing\neverything that I have.\n\n567\n00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.590\nSo if it doesn't show up within this list,\n\n568\n00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:24.071\nyou can always go down to\nthe browse this location.\n\n569\n00:28:24.071 --> 00:28:28.610\nOr, if you have things in your OneDrive,\nI think that's behind my head, actually.\n\n570\n00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:32.643\nYou can see that if I go here, it will\nconnect to my OneDrive account that is\n\n571\n00:28:32.643 --> 00:28:35.590\nassociated with my email\non my account all together.\n\n572\n00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:39.139\nSo if you have that as your storage\nplace you can always go to it.\n\n573\n00:28:39.139 --> 00:28:42.746\nSo I'm just gonna click on browse to\nPC just to show you that you can go to\n\n574\n00:28:42.746 --> 00:28:43.800\ndifferent places.\n\n575\n00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.090\nIt was already in that list but\nI'm going a long way.\n\n576\n00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:50.442\nWe'll go over to desktop, we'll go over\nto pictures and I will go ahead and\n\n577\n00:28:50.442 --> 00:28:53.912\nsend you this adorable picture\nof Mister Fuego and Bishop.\n\n578\n00:28:53.912 --> 00:28:59.307\nNotice that it gives me like\na new field in my me-mail?\n\n579\n00:28:59.307 --> 00:29:02.264\n[LAUGH] Email form, if you will say,\n\n580\n00:29:02.264 --> 00:29:08.090\nthat says here is the attached image or\nattached file with this email.\n\n581\n00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:11.390\nAwesome, I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick Send.\n\n582\n00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:16.018\nAnd then Ronnie goes ahead, or\nsorry Lance, receives the attachment.\n\n583\n00:29:16.018 --> 00:29:20.946\nNow I have actually have a email\nfrom Lance from yesterday or\n\n584\n00:29:20.946 --> 00:29:25.490\nanother time that we were\ndoing a show that has it here.\n\n585\n00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:28.930\nSo I'm going to, I have to kind\nof scroll on down to find it.\n\n586\n00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.720\nSee this photo,\nnotice it is in a conversation.\n\n587\n00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.567\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nexpand this out and\n\n588\n00:29:35.567 --> 00:29:41.180\nI know that there are attachments that I\nhave received because of the little icon.\n\n589\n00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:44.920\nAnd notice on this particular\nemail in my reading pane that\n\n590\n00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.500\nyou are showing me a picture of Fred.\n\n591\n00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.230\nRight, so I'm gonna open this\nemail to get in a new window.\n\n592\n00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:53.658\nGoing to open it, here we go.\n\n593\n00:29:53.658 --> 00:29:59.700\nSo I'm receiving an email with\nan attachment, so what can I do with this?\n\n594\n00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:04.950\nI can open the attachment with in\nthe preview or preview it within message.\n\n595\n00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:08.790\nI could open it externally\nas its own file.\n\n596\n00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.660\nAnd then what am I gonna\ndo with that file?\n\n597\n00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.800\nA lot of times I'm sending files\nto people I want them to have it.\n\n598\n00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.560\nHe would like me to\nhave a picture of Fred.\n\n599\n00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.902\nSo I wanna save it to my computer.\n\n600\n00:30:18.902 --> 00:30:24.450\nSo there's all the different things that\nwe can do with sent attachments to us.\n\n601\n00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:25.740\nSo let me show you.\n\n602\n00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:29.629\nSingle clicks, versus double clicks,\nversus clicking on the droppy down, yeah,\n\n603\n00:30:29.629 --> 00:30:30.300\ndrop it down.\n\n604\n00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.024\n&gt;&gt; Drop it down.\n[LAUGH]\n\n605\n00:30:32.024 --> 00:30:34.832\n&gt;&gt; Single clicking on a file,\n\n606\n00:30:34.832 --> 00:30:40.100\nyou can see that it's going\nto open in the message.\n\n607\n00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:40.924\nIt's not really opening on a message.\n\n608\n00:30:40.924 --> 00:30:46.057\nIt's really just showing you in preview,\nwithin the window that you're in,\n\n609\n00:30:46.057 --> 00:30:51.160\nyour received email Window, I think\nthat's what we're going with, yeah?\n\n610\n00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.946\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; It's this window that we're in, okay?\n\n611\n00:30:52.946 --> 00:30:56.140\nAnd how do I get back and\nI don't remember, I would always do this.\n\n612\n00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.390\nAnd I'm like, ugh, I didn't really want\nto preview it, I wanted to open it.\n\n613\n00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:03.720\nBut now I can't get back to\nthe message that was sent.\n\n614\n00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.935\nIt's right there, you see where it says\nback to message, so you gotta look for\n\n615\n00:31:06.935 --> 00:31:07.872\na tiny little button.\n\n616\n00:31:07.872 --> 00:31:12.432\nI feel like they need to make that bigger,\nmake it have a yellow border around it or\n\n617\n00:31:12.432 --> 00:31:16.270\nsomething to kinda really focus that\nbecause I miss it all the time.\n\n618\n00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:18.460\nAlso notice, really quickly,\n\n619\n00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:22.680\nthat since I clicked on it, they is an\nattachments contextual tab that comes up.\n\n620\n00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.840\nThat's going to give me all sorts of\ndifferent things that I could do as well.\n\n621\n00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.610\nNotice copy, save, so\nall the things that I'm showing,\n\n622\n00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:31.320\nthere's multiple ways to get to it.\n\n623\n00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:36.190\nSo, whether you wanna go to preview,\ngo to the contextual tab, that's fine.\n\n624\n00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:37.941\nWe're gonna go back to message.\n\n625\n00:31:37.941 --> 00:31:42.294\nIf I double-click on this, notice that\nit's going to open up into whatever\n\n626\n00:31:42.294 --> 00:31:45.090\nprogram that is associated\nwith that file type.\n\n627\n00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:49.711\nSince this is an image, that is so\ncute, [LAUGH] since this is a file,\n\n628\n00:31:49.711 --> 00:31:54.070\nis a picture it's gonna open\nin our photos application.\n\n629\n00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:55.980\nIf this was Word,\nit would open up in Word.\n\n630\n00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.740\nIf it was a PDF,\nit would open up in either reader or\n\n631\n00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.210\nyour Outlook, not Outlook, Acrobat.\n\n632\n00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:02.550\nSo it depends on what it is.\n\n633\n00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:05.320\nYou might get somebody that sends\nyou a file where it's I don't know\n\n634\n00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:09.330\nhow to open it, because maybe it's\na file extension that you don't have.\n\n635\n00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:14.070\nSo, if it doesn't open up, it's not\nthat it's broken, it could be broken.\n\n636\n00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:18.210\nIt might just be that you can't open it\nbecause you don't have the application to\n\n637\n00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:19.310\ngo with it.\n\n638\n00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:22.903\nSo from here you can see we've got it\nopened, watching my window management.\n\n639\n00:32:22.903 --> 00:32:27.920\nI'm in a new program so I'm going to\njust close this but I would really\n\n640\n00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:32.950\nlike to have a picture of Fred for\nme to do, put it on my desktop right?\n\n641\n00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.687\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Because I think it's adorable I want to\n\n642\n00:32:34.687 --> 00:32:36.470\nput this as my background.\n\n643\n00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:41.073\nI click on the drop down from that\nfile and notice I can do a save as.\n\n644\n00:32:41.073 --> 00:32:43.644\nI can save it directly to\nOneDrive cuz I'm connected.\n\n645\n00:32:43.644 --> 00:32:45.877\nI could remove it, but I don't\nwanna remove this adorable picture,\n\n646\n00:32:45.877 --> 00:32:46.540\nit's really cute.\n\n647\n00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.520\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and click Save As.\n\n648\n00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.238\nThis is where now I can go ahead.\n\n649\n00:32:51.238 --> 00:32:56.116\nI don't really like that file name either\nso I'm just gonna go ahead and say Fred,\n\n650\n00:32:56.116 --> 00:33:01.204\nthe Otter and I'm gonna put it, put it on\nmy desktop as that's an easier place for\n\n651\n00:33:01.204 --> 00:33:02.428\nme to find it later.\n\n652\n00:33:02.428 --> 00:33:07.540\nSo you go ahead and say where you want\nto put it change it's name, click Save.\n\n653\n00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:11.980\nAnd now it is part of\nmy files that I have.\n\n654\n00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:15.588\nI can then close this message\nbecause I am done with it.\n\n655\n00:33:15.588 --> 00:33:19.221\nAnd just for\nfun let me see here's an updated.\n\n656\n00:33:19.221 --> 00:33:23.260\nSo let's go ahead and\ndouble click it, I'm gonna open it.\n\n657\n00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.352\nAw, that is too cute, Ronnie.\n\n658\n00:33:27.352 --> 00:33:31.829\nSo I think honestly that's probably\nthe perfect place to end on\n\n659\n00:33:31.829 --> 00:33:34.457\nthis cute picture of Fred the Otter.\n\n660\n00:33:34.457 --> 00:33:38.552\n&gt;&gt; All right, Von, well, thank you\nagain for helping us get started.\n\n661\n00:33:38.552 --> 00:33:42.364\nAnd take a look at being on the stand and\nas well as receive emails and\n\n662\n00:33:42.364 --> 00:33:45.920\nalso working with different\nattachments available.\n\n663\n00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.209\nWe did see kinda some of different\nthings will encounter especially in\n\n664\n00:33:49.209 --> 00:33:50.054\nbusiness sense.\n\n665\n00:33:50.054 --> 00:33:52.390\nSo make sure you watch\nthe show a couple of times.\n\n666\n00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:56.140\nIt's not the most difficult show\na lot of it was fairly intuitive.\n\n667\n00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:57.165\nBut it never helps, never helps.\n\n668\n00:33:57.165 --> 00:34:00.116\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It never hurts to go over some of\n\n669\n00:34:00.116 --> 00:34:02.043\nthe basics we have available to us.\n\n670\n00:34:02.043 --> 00:34:04.660\nThat's a great place for\nus to also sign off.\n\n671\n00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.302\nFor OFFICE ProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n672\n00:34:07.302 --> 00:34:07.990\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Von Smith.\n\n673\n00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:11.432\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right

how all of that works.\n\n14\n00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.540\nSo why don't we go ahead and\njump on into this.\n\n15\n00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.885\nI've got Outlook already ready and\nit is just a continuation from part 1 but\n\n16\n00:00:56.885 --> 00:01:02.331\nif you seem like I don't remember\nreceiving these emails or they are unread.\n\n17\n00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:06.333\nWhat I did is I actually marked them\nas unread even though I had already,\n\n18\n00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.350\nwe had done some set up\nbefore we started everything.\n\n19\n00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.920\nI wanted to just kind of\ndraw attention to them,\n\n20\n00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.430\nlike how did you do that I'll show you.\n\n21\n00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.380\nLike for example this one.\n\n22\n00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.520\nI've already read it, but\nI wanted to mark it as unread and\n\n23\n00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.150\nwhy would I want to do that.\n\n24\n00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.910\nMaybe just to kinda remind yourself\nto just say hey come back to this.\n\n25\n00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.280\nI mean this is all on how you work.\n\n26\n00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.750\nAnd how you want to identify\nwhat you need to follow up on.\n\n27\n00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.720\nWe're gonna have lots of emails,\n[LAUGH] lots of episodes about how to\n\n28\n00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.610\nstay organized within Outlook, so\nit's really just how you want to do it.\n\n29\n00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.490\nBut how do I mark it as unread?\n\n30\n00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.800\nI do it by right clicking.\n\n31\n00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.960\nOkay, there's a lot of stuff you can do by\nright clicking so I like to go ahead and\n\n32\n00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.930\nchoose then, mark unread.\n\n33\n00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.020\nSomething will pop up on this\nparticular one, well it didn't do it.\n\n34\n00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.058\nIs that sometimes when you do it\nwithin conversations it will say,\n\n35\n00:02:00.058 --> 00:02:02.890\ndo you want to mark this for\neverything in this conversation?\n\n36\n00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.810\nAnd that little warning box will pop\nup and you can either say yes or no.\n\n37\n00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.315\nFor some reason it wanted to go ahead and\nnot show.\n\n38\n00:02:10.315 --> 00:02:13.780\n[LAUGH] It's trying to really\ngo against me right now.\n\n39\n00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.490\nBut it's okay.\n\n40\n00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.880\nWe can roll with it,\nbecause we can do that.\n\n41\n00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.460\nI could always come into the expanding.\n\n42\n00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.480\nAnd I could go ahead and\nmark an individual one as unread, and\n\n43\n00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.240\nthen we can go.\n\n44\n00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.480\nYou know why it was?\n\n45\n00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.970\nCuz it was the center.\n\n46\n00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.440\nOkay it was, it wasn't against me,\n\n47\n00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.110\nit's just saying Vonny, forgot what\nyou actually put in that conversation.\n\n48\n00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.840\nSo that's why it marked it.\n\n49\n00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.110\nIt didn't give me the warnings.\n\n50\n00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.680\nSo I didn't have multiple inbox replies\nin this particular conversation.\n\n51\n00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.770\nSo good, now we know.\n\n52\n00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.800\nWe're gonna talk about emailing\nmultiple people, like I said.\n\n53\n00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.170\nSo let's go ahead and get started.\n\n54\n00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.340\nWe're going to start a new email.\n\n55\n00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.359\nIf I want to create multiple recipients,\nI want to send this not only to Lance but\n\n56\n00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.211\nI also want to send it to Joey.\n\n57\n00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:01.947\nBecause those are the two people I'm\nworking on in a project to get JT back\n\n58\n00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:04.770\ninto that reunion toy that\nwe keep talking about.\n\n59\n00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.830\nSo, I wanna email those two,\nwe're going to go ahead and\n\n60\n00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.180\nstart typing that Lance is already in my\nauto complete and it is the correct one.\n\n61\n00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.680\nSo I'll go ahead and type that in.\n\n62\n00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.750\nBut, I have Joey.\n\n63\n00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.830\nNow if I start typing in J O, I know\nthat Joey is part of my organization.\n\n64\n00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.450\nAnd when we're part of an organization\nthat we're all on the same domain,\n\n65\n00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.450\nsame company,\n\n66\n00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.720\nsame university, I know that there's\nsomething as a global address book.\n\n67\n00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.310\nSo I know I could find him in there.\n\n68\n00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.075\nSo lets go ahead and address that and\nother ways of getting people into\n\n69\n00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:46.018\nour different fields cause we're also\ngonna talk about CC and the BCC.\n\n70\n00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:49.970\nHow can I make it a little easier for\nme and just typing?\n\n71\n00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.760\nEach one of these buttons cause\nthey really are a button,\n\n72\n00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.400\nthey go to a select name dialog\nbox where I can go ahead access.\n\n73\n00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.217\nThat global address book and\nyou can also address you contacts.\n\n74\n00:04:03.217 --> 00:04:08.111\nWe're not in the contacts\narea of Outlook just yet but\n\n75\n00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:13.780\nwe will go ahead and have episodes\non that in just a little bit.\n\n76\n00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.450\nLittle bit is a relative term depending\non where you are in the series.\n\n77\n00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.450\nClick on one of the buttons.\n\n78\n00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.430\nIf I click on the two you can see that\nit opens up into the select names for\n\n79\n00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.750\nanyone of your fields that\nyou're addressing this to.\n\n80\n00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.210\nAnd it opens up in the off\nthe global address list for\n\n81\n00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.790\nout office pro demo co company.\n\n82\n00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.450\nIn a global address book there going to\nbe not just people there could be groups,\n\n83\n00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.000\nthere could be things in this\ndistribution list, there can\n\n84\n00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.960\nalso be resources you can see that maybe\nI'm addressing this to this Porsche.\n\n85\n00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.390\nWell, a Porsche isn't a person\nI think that's a resource.\n\n86\n00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.010\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n87\n00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.110\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n88\n00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.660\nSo the different icons-\n&gt;&gt; The company car.\n\n89\n00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.530\n&gt;&gt; It is a company car?\n\n90\n00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.780\nYes, I like this yeah good job.\n\n91\n00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.524\nSo we have the different icons next\nto what this thing is in a global\n\n92\n00:05:05.524 --> 00:05:10.010\naddress book and it always opens\nup to this global address list\n\n93\n00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.052\nby default when you do that select names.\n\n94\n00:05:13.052 --> 00:05:16.763\nNow, maybe there's somebody that's not\nin our global address list that's in my\n\n95\n00:05:16.763 --> 00:05:19.360\ncontacts, that's outside\nof my organization.\n\n96\n00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.750\nYou can choose where you're pulling these\nnames from in the address book dropdown.\n\n97\n00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.510\nAnd notice, that contacts,\nthose are my contacts here, in Outlook,\n\n98\n00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.100\nthat are for me.\n\n99\n00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.340\nAnd you can see that it also breaks down\nthe different ways, the rooms, the users,\n\n100\n00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.950\nthe groups,\n\n101\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.580\nif you wanna kinda filter down your\nglobal address list, you could go ahead.\n\n102\n00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.630\nAnd actually, it's all of your addresses,\n\n103\n00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.920\nwhether it's in a global or\nlocal contacts, if you wanna say.\n\n104\n00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.910\nSo just to show you that, my kinda,\nI don't have a lot of contacts in here,\n\n105\n00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.910\ncuz we haven't really\nbuilt that up too much.\n\n106\n00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.073\nAnd you are like well Joey and\nLance are in your contacts.\n\n107\n00:05:55.073 --> 00:05:57.310\nYeah, I put them in my contacts.\n\n108\n00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.933\nYou can take somebody from global and\nput them in your local just for\n\n109\n00:06:00.933 --> 00:06:02.361\norganization purposes.\n\n110\n00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:04.140\nIt is really up to you\nhow you want to do it.\n\n111\n00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.840\nLet us go back to that global and\nI want to email this to Joey,\n\n112\n00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.290\nnow you have to be careful\nabout where am I at.\n\n113\n00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.536\nI'm in the to field.\n\n114\n00:06:12.536 --> 00:06:14.080\nSee how it's kinda highlighted?\n\n115\n00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.540\nSo if I double click right now,\nI'm going to populate it into that field.\n\n116\n00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.210\nIf I didn't want that, maybe I\ndouble clicked oops too many times,\n\n117\n00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.520\nyou can come down here and just get\nyour cursor and hit the backspace.\n\n118\n00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.370\nAnd it's gonna backspace over\nthe entire name, that entire email or\n\n119\n00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.300\ncontact that you have in here.\n\n120\n00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.550\nThen maybe,\nI wanna Joey to go to the CC field.\n\n121\n00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.360\nNow, we really haven't addressed\nspecifically what the CC field is just\n\n122\n00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.640\nyet, but if I wanted him to go into the CC\ninstead, let me backspace out of that.\n\n123\n00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.950\nI have my name, my highlighting on Joey,\nI can click which button,\n\n124\n00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.510\nor which field I want\nhim to populate into.\n\n125\n00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:01.246\nSo if I click here notice that Joey\ngoes down into the CC field instead of\n\n126\n00:07:01.246 --> 00:07:02.222\nthe to field.\n\n127\n00:07:02.222 --> 00:07:05.870\nAnd you could also, you could actually\njust drag them if you wanted to.\n\n128\n00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.460\nSo it's like oops, need to go ahead and\nput him down in there.\n\n129\n00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.620\nSo you could see I just clicked\nhim once to highlight it.\n\n130\n00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.810\nAnd then I can get the four\npointed arrows and\n\n131\n00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.700\nI can move it around into\nthe specific field that I wanted.\n\n132\n00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.550\nSo let's go ahead and move that back\nbecause I'm addressing this directly to\n\n133\n00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.290\nLance and Joey, those are they people\nthat I'm specifically speaking to.\n\n134\n00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.540\nNow that CC field.\n\n135\n00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.640\nMaybe there's somebody that I would\nlike to copy onto this email.\n\n136\n00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.960\nIt's more an indirect conversation.\n\n137\n00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.680\nI want somebody to know that I'm having\na conversation between Lance and Joey.\n\n138\n00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.950\nAnd if we start responding,\n\n139\n00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:49.260\nif that person stays CC'ed, then they\nknow the conversation that's going on.\n\n140\n00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.924\nThis is where you have to kinda\ndetermine within your organization, or\n\n141\n00:07:52.924 --> 00:07:53.970\nyour own workflow.\n\n142\n00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.353\nWhen to CC and when not to CC.\n\n143\n00:07:57.353 --> 00:07:58.428\nI call it the CC game.\n\n144\n00:07:58.428 --> 00:08:04.020\nBecause sometimes you want people to know,\nhey, I'm talking to these people.\n\n145\n00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.530\nMaybe like your boss?\n\n146\n00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.170\nOr somebody that's like, you see,\nI'm doing what I'm supposed to do.\n\n147\n00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.700\nIt all depends on when and\nwhere to use it.\n\n148\n00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:20.180\nAnd you have to kinda determine that,\nbut it can be a good thing.\n\n149\n00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.710\nIt can kind of backfire on you, sometimes.\n\n150\n00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.230\nAnd I don't want to be\na part if this conversation.\n\n151\n00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.170\nI thought you did.\n\n152\n00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:30.720\nSo, and you have people that are in cc but\n\n153\n00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.825\nyou really be talking to both of them,\nand everybody's on it.\n\n154\n00:08:34.825 --> 00:08:40.570\nAgain, I'm digressing here, but\nwhat that particular field means.\n\n155\n00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:45.600\nAnd so I could go ahead and\naddress this to Chris.\n\n156\n00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.570\nSo Chris is another person\nin our organization.\n\n157\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.480\nHe's in the band, but he has an e-mail\naddress that's not part of it.\n\n158\n00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.400\nSo we're gonna do Chris.\n\n159\n00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.895\nOffice pro demo code at Gmail.com.\n\n160\n00:08:58.895 --> 00:09:03.440\nSo I have created Chris a Gmail account.\n\n161\n00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.602\nAnd so I am putting that in the CC so that\nway, cuz I have already, maybe it's like\n\n162\n00:09:07.602 --> 00:09:11.765\nI've already talked to Chris about this,\nand I told him that I am going to contact\n\n163\n00:09:11.765 --> 00:09:15.340\nJoey and Lance, so I'll CC you on that so\nyou can see what is going on.\n\n164\n00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.730\nPerfect, we'll get the PBC [LAUGH],\n\n165\n00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.620\nthe-\n&gt;&gt; BCC.\n\n166\n00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.828\nYeah, I did it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We keep doing that.\n\n167\n00:09:24.828 --> 00:09:27.910\nClick OK, and so now you can see\nthat this went ahead and popped it.\n\n168\n00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:32.470\nI'm gonna go ahead and check that name\njust to see that I did get Gmail.\n\n169\n00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:33.300\nSo it does see it.\n\n170\n00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.530\nAnd Chris.officeprodemo.com.\n\n171\n00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:38.570\nOkay, I think I've got that right.\n\n172\n00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.740\nSo let's go ahead and have a conversation.\n\n173\n00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:46.730\nWe'll say reunion,\nreunion tour, reunion tour.\n\n174\n00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.040\nLet's do it.\n\n175\n00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.147\nThat's good enough.\n\n176\n00:09:51.147 --> 00:09:54.474\nOkay, so now I've gone ahead and\naddressed it to multiple people.\n\n177\n00:09:54.474 --> 00:09:56.210\nI've CC'd Chris.\n\n178\n00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.770\nAnd so that way,\nChris will see it that, yeah,\n\n179\n00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:02.980\nI see that you've talked to, you're\ntalking to Lance and Joey in the to field.\n\n180\n00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.320\nThey will see that Chris is in the CC.\n\n181\n00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.930\nSo everybody sees what's\non the table right now.\n\n182\n00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:13.060\nIf I go ahead and click Send, now you\ncan see that I have sent that off to my\n\n183\n00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.840\nmultiple people, and they will be able\nto see everything and then reply.\n\n184\n00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:23.500\nOkay, so\nlet's talk about on the receiving end.\n\n185\n00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.760\nI need to reply to an e-mail that\nhas multiple recipients in it.\n\n186\n00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:33.220\nI have right here something from\nLance that we had set up everybody.\n\n187\n00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.745\nSo I am going to open this so\nwe can see this a little bit better.\n\n188\n00:10:36.745 --> 00:10:41.875\nI can see that this is sent to me, but\n\n189\n00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:49.060\nit is also sent to Joey and\nit is also sent to Chris.\n\n190\n00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:54.120\nSo I know that I am on\na multiple recipient e-mail.\n\n191\n00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.040\nThis is where I need to decide do\nI want to talk to everybody, or\n\n192\n00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.710\ndo I want to just talk to Lance?\n\n193\n00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:05.261\nOkay, the Reply All, and I'm sure maybe\nwe've been in organizations where it's\n\n194\n00:11:05.261 --> 00:11:09.096\nlike the one person you see an e-mail\nthat goes back to the sender, but\n\n195\n00:11:09.096 --> 00:11:12.585\nit was, we really weren't all\nsupposed to see that response.\n\n196\n00:11:12.585 --> 00:11:14.250\n[LAUGH] The reply all.\n\n197\n00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.990\nOr somebody that always hits\nthe reply all when you really,\n\n198\n00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.540\nI don't need to see everything.\n\n199\n00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:26.380\nAgain, all up to how you and\nyour workflow, and your company work for.\n\n200\n00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:32.924\nI'm going to click, if I do click Reply\nAll, I'm sending back this to everybody.\n\n201\n00:11:32.924 --> 00:11:36.960\nIf it's long, everybody sees it.\n\n202\n00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.260\nBut maybe I really only\nwanted to talk to Lance.\n\n203\n00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.810\nI'm gonna close this cuz, nope,\nI don't wanna Reply to All.\n\n204\n00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:48.560\nIf I click Reply, it's only to\nthe person that sent it to me.\n\n205\n00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:54.440\nSo I only wanna talk to Lance, and say,\nhey, so can you take me off the reply all?\n\n206\n00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:59.480\nOr the ones that respond to the reply all,\nlike take me off this list.\n\n207\n00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.840\nSorry.\nI'm just gonna say thanks,\n\n208\n00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.230\ncuz we don't really say anything here.\n\n209\n00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:11.650\nBut just kind of explaining when to\nreply and when to reply all here.\n\n210\n00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.730\nOne thing to notice, though,\nand this always throws me off.\n\n211\n00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.870\nRemember I talked about multiple windows\nand watching your window management?\n\n212\n00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:21.760\nLet me do that again.\n\n213\n00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.040\nSo I'm going open this up.\n\n214\n00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.740\nAnd this is the one.\n\n215\n00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.290\nI've opened the window.\n\n216\n00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:31.510\nAnd so here's,\nmy second window is in Outlook.\n\n217\n00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.305\nI'm going to reply.\n\n218\n00:12:33.305 --> 00:12:37.695\nNotice, it's opened up another window,\nokay?\n\n219\n00:12:37.695 --> 00:12:41.910\nAnd so, the reply is from this,\nthat's in this.\n\n220\n00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.650\nSo if I reply,\nI'm going to just type in reply again.\n\n221\n00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.920\nAnd I send it, I just sent that one,\nand this stays open.\n\n222\n00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.990\nSo if you're replying to multiple windows,\n\n223\n00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.060\nand I've done that where I've come back\nand close, close, close, close, close.\n\n224\n00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.720\nI'm closing all of the e-mails\nthat I opened because I\n\n225\n00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.630\ndidn't do it like within the reading\npane and it kept it open.\n\n226\n00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:07.730\nThis is just a default setting\nthat Outlook has to say\n\n227\n00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.129\nI will always open up a new window for\nthe reply.\n\n228\n00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.830\nIf you don't like that, just to let\nyou know that you can set that.\n\n229\n00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:22.593\nIt's in your options,\nand it's in your mail,\n\n230\n00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:26.660\nand then it is in right here.\n\n231\n00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.730\nYou see where it says replies and\nforwards?\n\n232\n00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:33.850\nIt says close original message\nwindow when replying or forwarding.\n\n233\n00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:37.010\nIf you wanted to have\nthat stop staying open,\n\n234\n00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:41.380\ncheck that box off and\nit will automatically close that.\n\n235\n00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:46.010\nSo a little setting that I've done\nbecause it kept bothering me so\n\n236\n00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.333\nI wanted to point that out here.\n\n237\n00:13:48.333 --> 00:13:55.256\nOkay, [LAUGH] can we do [LAUGH] No,\nI'm the king of the robots.\n\n238\n00:13:55.256 --> 00:14:00.372\nSo, yes, we,\nyou can see that Lance has replied, and\n\n239\n00:14:00.372 --> 00:14:05.950\nI can see that Lance replied to me,\nand to Joey and to Chris.\n\n240\n00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.845\nSo, he did a reply all.\n\n241\n00:14:07.845 --> 00:14:10.890\nSo, there we go, wonderful.\n\n242\n00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:12.300\nAnd now we have a conversation.\n\n243\n00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.750\nWe understand what these\ndifferent fields are.\n\n244\n00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.060\nSo, where we gonna go to next?\n\n245\n00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:18.940\nGoodness.\n\n246\n00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.210\n&gt;&gt; The BCC.\n\n247\n00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:24.160\n&gt;&gt; The BCC field in your e-mail,\nblind carbon copy.\n\n248\n00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:28.030\nThis is where you start hiding things.\n\n249\n00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:32.312\nMaybe you're having a conversation\nbetween you and a co-worker, and\n\n250\n00:14:32.312 --> 00:14:35.804\nyou want to include your boss on this or\nsomebody else, but\n\n251\n00:14:35.804 --> 00:14:38.388\nyou don't want the other person to see it.\n\n252\n00:14:38.388 --> 00:14:41.860\nAnd this is where it starts sounding\na little devious [LAUGH] and\n\n253\n00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.820\na little covert.\n\n254\n00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.762\nSo I guess that's also, always be aware,\n\n255\n00:14:46.762 --> 00:14:52.320\nat any time in any of your e-mail\nexchanges, anyone could be bcc'd on that.\n\n256\n00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.010\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n257\n00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:55.140\n&gt;&gt; So\nbe cautious about what you say sometimes.\n\n258\n00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:57.851\nJust throwing it out there.\n\n259\n00:14:57.851 --> 00:15:02.880\n[LAUGH] So what is the, like I said it's\nthe bcc, it's the blind carbon copy.\n\n260\n00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.340\nAnd who's seeing what?\n\n261\n00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.322\nAnd this is where,\nis everybody in the BCC field, or\n\n262\n00:15:08.322 --> 00:15:09.960\nare there people in the To field?\n\n263\n00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.160\nLet me explain.\n\n264\n00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.590\nI'm gonna come into here.\n\n265\n00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:17.570\nIf I address this to Lance,\nand I see, I go ahead and,\n\n266\n00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.330\nlet me go ahead and,\nI thought I was doing the auto complete.\n\n267\n00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:21.680\nI forgot where I was at.\n\n268\n00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.708\nWe'll go ahead and do Lance.\n\n269\n00:15:23.708 --> 00:15:31.626\nAnd I BCC Joey,\nJoey needs to go down here, okay?\n\n270\n00:15:31.626 --> 00:15:37.940\nJoey is going to receive the e-mail and\nsee that it went to Lance.\n\n271\n00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.190\nLance will also see that it went to him,\nbut he won't see Joey.\n\n272\n00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:44.530\nSo if there's somebody in the To or\nthe BCC field,\n\n273\n00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:50.130\nthat person that gets blind carbon copied\non it, it sees those recipients, okay?\n\n274\n00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.950\nI actually have an example over here.\n\n275\n00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:58.550\nThis is Chris' e-mail in Gmail\njust show you something here.\n\n276\n00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:05.030\nIs that I can see that Justin sent this\nto me, but it was to Lance and Joey.\n\n277\n00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:10.640\nI'm not in the to field, so\nI can see that conversation,\n\n278\n00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.760\nbut Lance and\nJoey didn't see me on their email.\n\n279\n00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.840\nOkay, so just kind of clarifying.\n\n280\n00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:23.330\nTo and\nCcs always get shown to everybody, okay?\n\n281\n00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.180\nLet's come back over to here.\n\n282\n00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:30.770\nSo that's kind of the composition\nof where our addresses are.\n\n283\n00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:34.410\nNow, I moved Lance down into the Bcc.\n\n284\n00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.550\nI gotta make sure I got that\nsemicolon in between them.\n\n285\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:41.330\nAlways separate your multiple\nrecipients by semicolons.\n\n286\n00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.550\nWhen I was using this, it automatically\ndid this and sometimes when you delete it,\n\n287\n00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.330\nyou get multiple semicolons.\n\n288\n00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:50.520\nSo just kinda go back and proof it out and\nmake sure that there is a semicolon\n\n289\n00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.800\nbetween each recipient in\nwhatever field you're working in.\n\n290\n00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:01.320\nNow if I sent this to Joey and\nLance, that were both gonna be Bcc,\n\n291\n00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:06.965\nand nobody's in the To or the CC,\nwhat this is gonna look like is that Joey\n\n292\n00:17:06.965 --> 00:17:12.140\nthinks that this email has only\nbeen sent to him from me, SJT.\n\n293\n00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:17.540\nLance will also receive\nan email from JT and\n\n294\n00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.630\nthink that he is the only\nperson on that email as well.\n\n295\n00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.810\nIt's like you're basically\nprotecting people,\n\n296\n00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.670\nif you wanna say,\nfrom their email addresses.\n\n297\n00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.470\nLike if I was emailing this out to a list\nof students or all of my instructors and\n\n298\n00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:34.530\nI wanted them to see like this\nglobal message from me, but if\n\n299\n00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:39.040\nI put them all in the to field, everybody\nsees each other's email addresses.\n\n300\n00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.000\nAnd of course, what does that mean?\n\n301\n00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.317\nYou can take them and\nyou can email that person individually.\n\n302\n00:17:43.317 --> 00:17:45.997\nSo I'm trying to kind of\nhide their identity but\n\n303\n00:17:45.997 --> 00:17:48.147\njust hide their privacy a little bit.\n\n304\n00:17:48.147 --> 00:17:52.334\nLike I don't want to send every single\nstudent everybody's email address because\n\n305\n00:17:52.334 --> 00:17:54.520\nthey don't need to see that.\n\n306\n00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:59.690\nSo putting everybody in the Bcc,\nmessage to everybody but\n\n307\n00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:03.580\nit's only to a single\nrecipient on their end.\n\n308\n00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.830\nSo understanding when\nto use the Bcc versus\n\n309\n00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:11.230\nputting everybody into the To field.\n\n310\n00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.780\nDo you want everybody to see everything or\n\n311\n00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.590\nyou want people to not see everything,\nokay?\n\n312\n00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:20.393\nSo that's always a good\nthing to notice about.\n\n313\n00:18:20.393 --> 00:18:23.447\nSo if I go ahead and say okay,\nI'm in the Bcc field and\n\n314\n00:18:23.447 --> 00:18:25.610\nnotice that that field came back up.\n\n315\n00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.690\nIn our previous episode,\nyou could always add the Bcc\n\n316\n00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:35.270\ninto that field in your new email\naddresses by going to options and\n\n317\n00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.830\nthen typing,\ncuz maybe you have your auto completes.\n\n318\n00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.770\nYou don't wanna go into that\nselect name dialog box,\n\n319\n00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:45.260\nyou can always add that field and\nmove in from there.\n\n320\n00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:49.510\nSo, if I typed in here and\nI can say like, to you,\n\n321\n00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:56.808\nfor you only which isn't really true and\nthen I'll say,\n\n322\n00:18:56.808 --> 00:19:01.960\nyou are Bcc and\nI know she gotten emails like that.\n\n323\n00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.150\nThis is sent to everybody.\n\n324\n00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:08.020\nThis is blind carbon copy to everybody\nin the organization or whatever.\n\n325\n00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.610\nI actually seen like,\nyou're not the only one in here.\n\n326\n00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:12.894\nIt's sometimes kinda nice.\n\n327\n00:19:12.894 --> 00:19:15.650\nOkay, well thank you for\nletting me know that this is global,\n\n328\n00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:17.390\nthat it isn't just to me.\n\n329\n00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.010\nI'm not special.\n\n330\n00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.610\nEverybody's getting this email.\n\n331\n00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:25.990\nYou're just letting me know that it's a\nglobal message but I don't see everything.\n\n332\n00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:29.510\nSo I click Send and\nthen we go on from there.\n\n333\n00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:34.520\nAnd I've actually gotten some, I showed\nyou the Chris email of where we had some\n\n334\n00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:39.940\nTo fields and then this is the one that\n\n335\n00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.460\nBcc and\nthen everybody just gets that as me.\n\n336\n00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.460\nI don't see anybody else,\neven if I did a reply all.\n\n337\n00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.380\nIt doesn't show me that as well.\n\n338\n00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.900\nSo Bcc's, good thing to know about and\nwhen to use them.\n\n339\n00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.290\nNext part in this demonstration,\nin this particular episode,\n\n340\n00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:00.430\nI wanted to get into the drafts.\n\n341\n00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.420\nThe drafts folder over here,\n\n342\n00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.830\nnow I actually have a few things\ncuz I'm setting up for later.\n\n343\n00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:07.930\nWhat does the drafts do?\n\n344\n00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.890\nWe know from that previous episode\nit's where all of our saved\n\n345\n00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:14.380\nemails go into because maybe\nI wanna start an email.\n\n346\n00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.780\nI'm not ready to send it.\n\n347\n00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.470\nFor example here, I'm doing a draft test.\n\n348\n00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:20.590\nI address it to Lance.\n\n349\n00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.310\nI put a subject matter in there.\n\n350\n00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:27.690\nI went ahead and started writing,\nbut I wasn't ready to send this yet.\n\n351\n00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:31.520\nSo putting it into that\ndrafts is important.\n\n352\n00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.050\nIf I go back over to home and\nI go into my new email and\n\n353\n00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:36.460\nlet's go ahead and\nwe'll start another one.\n\n354\n00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:42.240\nAnd we'll go with Lance and\nwe're going to say, save for later part 2.\n\n355\n00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.070\nSo I know which one, and I start typing.\n\n356\n00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.160\nI could go ahead say, I'm not ready,\nI don't know what I wanna say just yet.\n\n357\n00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.950\nIf you click the save button in\nyour compose message window,\n\n358\n00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:57.300\nit will automatically go\nright into your drafts.\n\n359\n00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.580\nSo if I close this, notice it right there.\n\n360\n00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:05.515\nAnd it's bold because this is the newest\none within your drafts folder that you\n\n361\n00:21:05.515 --> 00:21:07.170\nhaven't addressed yet.\n\n362\n00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.720\nOne thing to notice though,\nwhen you are typing an email, and\n\n363\n00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.000\nthis has happened to me a lot of times,\nI'm in the middle of writing a long email.\n\n364\n00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.520\nIt's like five, six, seven minutes in and\nthen I step away and I come back and\n\n365\n00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.070\nI look into my drafts folder because\nmaybe I've minimized this and\n\n366\n00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.140\nI don't even know what's going on.\n\n367\n00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.350\nBecause I have so many things going on.\n\n368\n00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:27.820\nIf I go in my drafts.\n\n369\n00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.490\nIt will do an auto-save to where,\nit's an auto-save and\n\n370\n00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:34.190\ngoes into your drafts after three minutes.\n\n371\n00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.310\nSo I can go in my drafts and\nI can see lots of incomplete messages but\n\n372\n00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.130\nthey're still open.\n\n373\n00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.530\nSo if you ever see that,\nthat's what's happening.\n\n374\n00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:45.700\nAnd you can set this,\nactually, in your options.\n\n375\n00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:50.210\nIf you go into Options and\nyou go into mail,\n\n376\n00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:56.130\nyou go into, right there, save messages,\nautomatically saves items that have not\n\n377\n00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:01.140\nbeen sent after this many minutes,\nand save it into this drafts folder.\n\n378\n00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:05.508\nOkay, so if I waited long enough and\nI started this email right here.\n\n379\n00:22:05.508 --> 00:22:09.998\nEven though I don't have\nanything addressed to it and\n\n380\n00:22:09.998 --> 00:22:14.685\nI haven't sent it,\nit will show up in that drafts folder\n\n381\n00:22:14.685 --> 00:22:19.200\nwhile I still have it open,\nand I'll see it in there.\n\n382\n00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:23.130\nLet me go ahead and\nstart addressing this, whoops, okay.\n\n383\n00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:25.999\nRight here, there was that window,\nthat warning that was like,\n\n384\n00:22:25.999 --> 00:22:27.572\nhey do you wanna save your changes?\n\n385\n00:22:27.572 --> 00:22:32.909\nAnd even if it's doing the autosave,\nthe warning will change to where it says,\n\n386\n00:22:32.909 --> 00:22:37.609\nwe have already saved a version of this\nright now do you want to save your\n\n387\n00:22:37.609 --> 00:22:41.530\nmost recent changes or\ndo you wanna not save your changes?\n\n388\n00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:45.450\nSo that warning box will change.\n\n389\n00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:52.610\nIf you've gone past that auto save time\nlimit that is set within your Outlook.\n\n390\n00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:56.180\nSo just in case your,\nyour warning buttons look different after,\n\n391\n00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.870\nwhen you're closing an email\nthat you're not ready to send or\n\n392\n00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.740\nyou don't like anything,\nI just wanted to kind of point that out.\n\n393\n00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:06.398\nBut I am gonna go ahead and\nclose this and not save the changes,\n\n394\n00:23:06.398 --> 00:23:07.569\ncuz I have some right in here.\n\n395\n00:23:07.569 --> 00:23:12.984\nSo let's say I have this saving for\nlater that I had done a while ago,\n\n396\n00:23:12.984 --> 00:23:17.850\nand I really want to go ahead and\nnow send this to Lance.\n\n397\n00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:22.780\nI'm in my drafts, I know it was in there,\nI can go ahead and maybe attach a file.\n\n398\n00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.320\nCuz I was waiting for\nthat file to come in.\n\n399\n00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.140\nAnd then I can go ahead and send this out.\n\n400\n00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.390\nNotice that it goes away.\n\n401\n00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:32.880\nIt's not in my Drafts folder\nanymore because I've completed it.\n\n402\n00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.390\nI wanted it.\n\n403\n00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:34.800\nI saved it.\n\n404\n00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.650\nNow I'm done.\n\n405\n00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:40.740\nIt goes out into my Sent Items,\nto where I've sent that out.\n\n406\n00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.820\nOkay, cuz maybe I was waiting for\nthat picture that I wanted to send.\n\n407\n00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.868\nOr I was waiting for somebody else to send\n\n408\n00:23:49.868 --> 00:23:54.760\nme the report to be able\nto then send on to Ronnie.\n\n409\n00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.840\nThat will be forwarding.\n\n410\n00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.269\nI want to forward a message,\nI got it from someone else And now,\n\n411\n00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:02.811\nokay, I just wanna send\nit right on to Ronnie.\n\n412\n00:24:02.811 --> 00:24:07.795\nSo maybe I got this one from Joey,\nhere we go.\n\n413\n00:24:07.795 --> 00:24:10.923\nThis email that I received\nfrom him to Justin, and\n\n414\n00:24:10.923 --> 00:24:13.390\nI'm like, this is a great email.\n\n415\n00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:15.578\nIt says all about this lorem ipsum.\n\n416\n00:24:15.578 --> 00:24:16.890\nLorem ipsum is great.\n\n417\n00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:18.854\nI think Ronnie would\nreally interested in this.\n\n418\n00:24:18.854 --> 00:24:21.730\nSo, forwarding it moves it on.\n\n419\n00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:26.260\nI can still open it,\ngo from the reading pane, or\n\n420\n00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.630\ngo from the ribbon, whichever way.\n\n421\n00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:31.030\nI'm gonna click the Forward\nfrom the reading pane, and\n\n422\n00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:35.960\nI'm going to type into Lance,\nand I'm going to say, great read.\n\n423\n00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.890\nI'm sure we've all gotten\nthese emails before.\n\n424\n00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.270\nIt's found something on the internet,\nand then you can see it's been what?\n\n425\n00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.470\nForwarded, forwarded, and\nforwarded, and forwarded.\n\n426\n00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:50.610\nAnd you see, that in the title or\nthe subject you can see FW to Lance.\n\n427\n00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:54.040\nSo he knows that I am\nforwarding this on to him.\n\n428\n00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:59.570\nAnd if I go ahead and click Send,\nnow I've moved that along.\n\n429\n00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.940\nKinda moved it down the chain, and\n\n430\n00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.880\nnow Ronnie is going to receive\na forwarded email from me.\n\n431\n00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:12.500\nWhat if I wanted to send something\nto Ronnie, not just as a forward,\n\n432\n00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:16.660\nthere's also something that\nis forward as attachment?\n\n433\n00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.530\nMaybe I have a long, a long email chain.\n\n434\n00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:23.390\nAnd I still wanna be able to go ahead and\nsend it to Ronnie, but\n\n435\n00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.300\nI don't want him to just kind\nof scroll on through it.\n\n436\n00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.380\nI just wanted it as an attachment.\n\n437\n00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.080\nSo that's something\nelse that you could do.\n\n438\n00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.520\nMaybe I could forward this along\nto you [LAUGH], my undeliverable.\n\n439\n00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:39.382\nSo I take this, I'm gonna open\nthis up to show you that there\n\n440\n00:25:39.382 --> 00:25:42.708\nis the option of forward as attachment.\n\n441\n00:25:42.708 --> 00:25:46.664\nNow I'm in the more button right here,\nbecause you might actually see it on your\n\n442\n00:25:46.664 --> 00:25:49.480\nribbon, but\nmy real estate doesn't allow me.\n\n443\n00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.800\nSo I'm going to forward as attachment,\nand look what happens.\n\n444\n00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.100\nIt opens up in another window.\n\n445\n00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.950\nIt gives the same subject, but\nnow I have it as an attached item.\n\n446\n00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.560\nNow this is an Outlook item file.\n\n447\n00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.064\nBut if it was an email,\nit usually would either zip it, up or\n\n448\n00:26:05.064 --> 00:26:08.220\nthat there's files that\nwill zip it up as well.\n\n449\n00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.796\nSo I'm sending this to him,\nnot as the body but\n\n450\n00:26:11.796 --> 00:26:14.834\nas an attachment, so that is another.\n\n451\n00:26:14.834 --> 00:26:16.580\nWhoops, that's the wrong one.\n\n452\n00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.957\nSo that is something that\nyou have an option for\n\n453\n00:26:19.957 --> 00:26:24.210\nif you wanted to give forward\nas a package, necessarily.\n\n454\n00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:26.992\nBecause, then that person\ncould then save that file and\n\n455\n00:26:26.992 --> 00:26:29.500\ndo whatever they would need to do with it.\n\n456\n00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.020\nAll right, I'm gonna close this window.\n\n457\n00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:35.970\nLet me go back to that cuz the last\nthing I wanted to address in this\n\n458\n00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:40.330\nparticular episode or\nthis part 2 is printing.\n\n459\n00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:45.420\nI want to take this email from Joey,\nand I wanna read this later,\n\n460\n00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.840\nI need to send it to the boss and\nthey're not on email.\n\n461\n00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.480\nWhatever reason you wanna print,\nwe're going to open the message.\n\n462\n00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.080\nWe're gonna go to File.\n\n463\n00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:58.400\nWe're gonna go to Print, and\nyou can see that it will go ahead and\n\n464\n00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.930\nprint out my options.\n\n465\n00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:03.805\nThey're usually, sometimes we'll\nhave different settings in here,\n\n466\n00:27:03.805 --> 00:27:05.730\ndepending on what item it is.\n\n467\n00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:07.040\nSo you could go ahead and do that.\n\n468\n00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:11.830\nBut I opened up the message\nspecifically that I wanted to print.\n\n469\n00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:15.030\nAnd that's just kind of\nthat window management\n\n470\n00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:20.300\nof making sure you are at\nthe place you want to print.\n\n471\n00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.120\nAnd I'm gonna close all of that out.\n\n472\n00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.355\nAnd for this part two.\n\n473\n00:27:24.355 --> 00:27:27.805\nI think that covers everything\non my little list over here, but\n\n474\n00:27:27.805 --> 00:27:29.095\nwe do have a part three.\n\n475\n00:27:29.095 --> 00:27:32.085\nWe have a couple more things that\nI want to address, maybe a little,\n\n476\n00:27:32.085 --> 00:27:34.495\nkind of tips and tricks here and there.\n\n477\n00:27:34.495 --> 00:27:37.465\nSo definitely come back and\ncheck it out one more time.\n\n478\n00:27:37.465 --> 00:27:41.400\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne, well that's a great\nplace for us to also sign off then.\n\n479\n00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.380\nFor OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n480\n00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:45.340\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Von

00:00:13.653\nYou're watching the Office 2016 show,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:13.653 --> 00:00:17.871\ntoday we're going into what some more\ndetails on email and basics here.\n\n5\n00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:20.292\nThis is a part three,\nhelping us to finish up and\n\n6\n00:00:20.292 --> 00:00:23.335\nwrap up all the content of this\nis gonna be Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:23.335 --> 00:00:24.271\nVonne, welcome back to the studios.\n\n8\n00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:25.609\n&gt;&gt; Hello, yes.\n\n9\n00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.991\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hello.\n\n10\n00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:30.578\nYes, we are on to part three\nof our basic emails and\n\n11\n00:00:30.578 --> 00:00:33.365\nwhen you think basic emails\nmaybe should just be one.\n\n12\n00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:37.107\nBut again, we're just getting a nice\nfoundation to establish for sending and\n\n13\n00:00:37.107 --> 00:00:38.105\nreceiving emails.\n\n14\n00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:43.986\nWe've gone through single recipients,\nmultiple recipients, the BCC.\n\n15\n00:00:43.986 --> 00:00:44.516\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n16\n00:00:44.516 --> 00:00:45.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I got it right.\n\n17\n00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.106\n[LAUGH] And\n\n18\n00:00:46.106 --> 00:00:51.530\nnow we're just on to just a few little\nkind of tidbits I would like to call them.\n\n19\n00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.070\nSo I wanna go over some attachments again.\n\n20\n00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.110\nThere gonna be some things\nwith dragging and dropping.\n\n21\n00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.405\nWe're gonna be dragging and\ndropping a lot actually.\n\n22\n00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:02.664\nWe're gonna talk about deleted emails and\nwhat we need to do with that.\n\n23\n00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:06.427\nAnd then, we're also going to\ntalk about undeliverables,\n\n24\n00:01:06.427 --> 00:01:11.369\nwhich we actually had happen in the first\npart which I didn't actually plan on,\n\n25\n00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.420\nbut hey,\nwe turned it into a teachable moment.\n\n26\n00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.244\nAnd so why don't we have another\nteachable moment as well.\n\n27\n00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:22.530\nSo let's jump back down into my\ninbox that I already have opened.\n\n28\n00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.401\nAnd then, in the first episode, the reason\nwe had that undeliverable message pop\n\n29\n00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:30.588\nback up was because I had\nmisspelled the domain name.\n\n30\n00:01:30.588 --> 00:01:33.840\nWe talked about the different\npieces of an email address.\n\n31\n00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.780\nAnd just let's go back to that message\nthat we got earlier in part one.\n\n32\n00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.565\nIt was saying that Lance could not\nreceive my email, because the DNS,\n\n33\n00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:48.283\nthe Domain Naming System,\ncouldn't understand what was going on.\n\n34\n00:01:48.283 --> 00:01:51.090\nAnd that's because I\nmisspelled was it Microsoft?\n\n35\n00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.670\nYes I always misspell Microsoft.\n\n36\n00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.050\nI forgot that S in there and so,\nthat's what the problem was.\n\n37\n00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.150\nWell, I have another mistake,\nI guess I would call it or\n\n38\n00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.780\na undeliverable message that came back,\nand here's this one, so\n\n39\n00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.740\nyou can see that this is coming from\nOffice 365, so a little bit different of\n\n40\n00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.520\nan error message than the one that I\nhad when I misspelled Lance's email.\n\n41\n00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.480\nOn this one it says that Vaughn,\nVaughn wasn't found on ITProTV.\n\n42\n00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.005\nSo it recognized that\nthe address after the at sign.\n\n43\n00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:32.860\nItpro.tv is a valid domain name,\nlike that's not the problem.\n\n44\n00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.930\nThe thing is that there is not a user in\n\n45\n00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.500\nthe itpro.tv domain of\nVaughn with three v's.\n\n46\n00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.432\nSo I misspelled the user name and you\ncan see that the error is different and\n\n47\n00:02:44.432 --> 00:02:48.501\nit's also nice that it gave us little\nlike hey, this is how you might fix it.\n\n48\n00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:52.298\nThank you very much,\ngives me some little links and\n\n49\n00:02:52.298 --> 00:02:56.373\nsome some feed back on what I\nmay be able to do with this.\n\n50\n00:02:56.373 --> 00:02:58.828\nAnd also more info for email domains.\n\n51\n00:02:58.828 --> 00:03:01.778\nThat's nice it kinda gives us\na little tutorial on what it\n\n52\n00:03:01.778 --> 00:03:03.875\nmeans to actually have an email domain.\n\n53\n00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:08.300\nNow, if I scroll on down through a little\nbit further, it actually gives me some\n\n54\n00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.054\nother, if you're not really familiar with\nsome techie jargon, as I like to call it,\n\n55\n00:03:13.054 --> 00:03:17.170\nbecause when you have emails,\nyou have things known as headers, right?\n\n56\n00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.690\nLike, if you think about like a head,\nand a body, and\n\n57\n00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.570\na foot, then the head is like\nthe beginning part of it.\n\n58\n00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.531\nIt's the header packets that get\nsent through all the TCP/IP,\n\n59\n00:03:27.531 --> 00:03:32.535\nall that kind of, see, I start talking\ntechie and I start tripping over myself.\n\n60\n00:03:32.535 --> 00:03:37.800\n[LAUGH] But it's the part that comes first\nand it has that basic information like\n\n61\n00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.004\nwho it's from, where it's going to,\nand the stuff to kinda get it started.\n\n62\n00:03:43.004 --> 00:03:46.977\nThen the meat, the middle part\ncomes in and then, I don't know if,\n\n63\n00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:47.963\nis there a foot?\n\n64\n00:03:47.963 --> 00:03:50.692\nThey're not really a footer in the packet,\nis there?\n\n65\n00:03:50.692 --> 00:03:52.270\n&gt;&gt; Well, there can be.\n\n66\n00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n\n67\n00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.499\nIn an e-mail, not?\n\n68\n00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:56.300\n&gt;&gt; There can be.\n\n69\n00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.450\nSo it just depends on the message itself.\n\n70\n00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.930\nSo all we're doing is we're seeing\ndifferent parts of the email.\n\n71\n00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.150\nThis information is useful for\ntroubleshooting, especially in message\n\n72\n00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.730\nlike this, and these details might not be\nany use to you and me as an end user, but\n\n73\n00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.920\nto your email administrator, it's gonna\nbe useful information they can use to\n\n74\n00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.240\njust really pinpoint in what\nothers use might be there.\n\n75\n00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that might be where if\nyou keep getting undeliverables, and\n\n76\n00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.270\nlike I know this exist, this person\nis here and hey I need some help.\n\n77\n00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.492\nYou could forward this message on to your\nIT personnel that might be able to look at\n\n78\n00:04:28.492 --> 00:04:32.216\nsome of these gully goop that might\nlook to you they're like, no,\n\n79\n00:04:32.216 --> 00:04:34.041\nI know exactly what the reason is.\n\n80\n00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:40.540\nAnd I know a little bit of this stuff but\nenough to know I don't know anything.\n\n81\n00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.543\nBut I actually have had undeliverable\nmessages to me before where I've looked\n\n82\n00:04:45.543 --> 00:04:50.948\nthrough stuff and I've found something\nin there, but is there a mailbox size?\n\n83\n00:04:50.948 --> 00:04:54.642\nSo it wasn't that it didn't exist, it's\nthat they had reached their capacity and\n\n84\n00:04:54.642 --> 00:04:58.095\nI wasn't able to send it, or there was\nsomething about maybe an attachment.\n\n85\n00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:00.925\nSo I was able to do\na little detective work\n\n86\n00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:04.945\nby reading through some\nof this stuff in here.\n\n87\n00:05:04.945 --> 00:05:08.783\nWhile I don't understand all of it,\nI got a little bit out of it.\n\n88\n00:05:08.783 --> 00:05:13.371\nSo just try it, see what you can look for\nand see if there is\n\n89\n00:05:13.371 --> 00:05:18.451\nan answer in this code to why you\nare getting an undeliverable.\n\n90\n00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:22.649\nAnd if it keeps on bouncing out, talk\nto the person, like, call the person on\n\n91\n00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:26.680\nthe phone or text them if you have\nsome other way of contacting them.\n\n92\n00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.566\nBut try to say like, hey,\nI'm not being able to get into your inbox,\n\n93\n00:05:30.566 --> 00:05:34.658\nlike it's just, do I have the right\naddress, what's wrong with this?\n\n94\n00:05:34.658 --> 00:05:39.447\nI mean, there is many different feature of\nsteps, I would say, along the way of where\n\n95\n00:05:39.447 --> 00:05:44.120\nyou can have something break, might not\nalways be you, might not always be them.\n\n96\n00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.994\nIt could just be, as I call it,\na fauna matrix, right,\n\n97\n00:05:46.994 --> 00:05:50.683\nthe hamsters running in the wheels\nare taking a little break right now.\n\n98\n00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:55.290\nSo, it happens, you can't always\nfigure out exactly what's wrong.\n\n99\n00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.960\nBut, isn't that just the world\nof computers we live in anyways.\n\n100\n00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.250\nSo, but at least, we can at least\nget some of our information\n\n101\n00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.510\nfrom our undeliverable messages.\n\n102\n00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.270\nOkay, perfect.\n\n103\n00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.130\nSo let's move on to another topic.\n\n104\n00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.489\nSo we're gonna take a turn, and\nwe're gonna go back to attachments\n\n105\n00:06:13.489 --> 00:06:19.611\nthat we had done, I believe, in part\none of our basic emailing shows, here.\n\n106\n00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:22.851\nWhen I start a new message and\nI'm ready to go ahead and\n\n107\n00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:25.800\nsend something, and I have an attachment.\n\n108\n00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.755\nI don't know if you do this Ronnie, but\n\n109\n00:06:27.755 --> 00:06:30.434\nI sometimes wait to the end\nto put an attachment on it.\n\n110\n00:06:30.434 --> 00:06:34.595\nAnd then guess what I do,\nI send it and there's no attachment.\n\n111\n00:06:34.595 --> 00:06:38.397\nAnd the person says, hey,\ndid you mean to attach that file like,\n\n112\n00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:40.346\nyes, I did, let me try it again.\n\n113\n00:06:40.346 --> 00:06:44.398\nIt's really great when you send it out\nto a really big list of people and\n\n114\n00:06:44.398 --> 00:06:49.095\nyou get to have everybody say that,\nhmm yeah, I forgot my attachment.\n\n115\n00:06:49.095 --> 00:06:54.240\nWell, the nice thing is that if\nyou word your email correctly,\n\n116\n00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.483\nand what I mean by correctly,\nin the eyes of Microsoft Outlook,\n\n117\n00:06:59.483 --> 00:07:05.042\nOutlook will help detect, hey,\ndid you mean to attach a file here?\n\n118\n00:07:05.042 --> 00:07:06.342\nIt'll give me a warning, and\n\n119\n00:07:06.342 --> 00:07:09.130\nI will tell you, that's actually\nsaved me quite a few times.\n\n120\n00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.900\nSo let's go ahead and\naddress this to Lance,\n\n121\n00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.061\njust to kinda get something started and\nI'll be like a file for\n\n122\n00:07:18.061 --> 00:07:24.731\nyou, and I will write in the message body,\nhello, I have the report attached.\n\n123\n00:07:24.731 --> 00:07:30.250\nPlease check and respond or\nsomething to that effect.\n\n124\n00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:30.870\nSo here we go.\n\n125\n00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:36.195\nSo I have written something in\nthe message that is kinda saying, hey,\n\n126\n00:07:36.195 --> 00:07:42.171\nI've got an attachment attached,\nfile, I mean, there's different ways.\n\n127\n00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:44.250\nAnd I haven't found the exact algorithm.\n\n128\n00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.310\nBut I'm pretty sure the keyword\nright there is attached, or\n\n129\n00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.142\nfile is attached for you.\n\n130\n00:07:49.142 --> 00:07:51.532\nThere is something in there that\nMicrosoft won't understand.\n\n131\n00:07:51.532 --> 00:07:54.901\nNow if I send this, see right there.\n\n132\n00:07:54.901 --> 00:07:59.950\nThere's the warning,\nyou may have forgotten to attach a file.\n\n133\n00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.934\nDo you wanna send this anyways?\n\n134\n00:08:01.934 --> 00:08:04.234\nOr, good, thanks Microsoft.\n\n135\n00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:05.817\nThank you for catching me.\n\n136\n00:08:05.817 --> 00:08:08.360\nLet me go ahead and\nget that attachment for you.\n\n137\n00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.900\nSo, this could be really, really helpful.\n\n138\n00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:15.440\nNow, there is situations where maybe\nyou're saying the report is attached\n\n139\n00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.460\nto your desk or attached to your door.\n\n140\n00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.660\nSo make sure you check it.\n\n141\n00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.647\nSo, we're wording it in a way that\nis like it's physically somewhere,\n\n142\n00:08:26.647 --> 00:08:28.624\nnot attached in this email.\n\n143\n00:08:28.624 --> 00:08:33.422\nSo there might be times where it's like,\nno, no, I'm gonna go ahead and send it\n\n144\n00:08:33.422 --> 00:08:38.434\nanyway, but it's nice that it gives enough\nof an intelligence, right, to get it to\n\n145\n00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:43.670\nwhere we might have forgotten something,\nso thanks for the warning there Microsoft.\n\n146\n00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:48.030\nI'm gonna go ahead and send it anyways,\nand then go ahead and send on.\n\n147\n00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.940\nSo, warning with your attachments.\n\n148\n00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.080\nOther things with attachments,\nwe went ahead and\n\n149\n00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.810\nshowed you how you can attach\na file by creating a new message.\n\n150\n00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:02.890\nComing in to the attached file and it's\nnice that it gives like the most recently\n\n151\n00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:07.200\nused or the most frequently\nused files in your system.\n\n152\n00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:07.810\nThat's great.\nBut\n\n153\n00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.730\nwhat if I have a bunch of files\nthat I wanna send and they're from\n\n154\n00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:15.790\nall different places and some are from\nmy My Documents and some are from here.\n\n155\n00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:20.310\nThere's other ways that you can\nget attachments into your email.\n\n156\n00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.510\nAnd I actually use this a lot.\n\n157\n00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.420\nI like this method.\n\n158\n00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.020\nSo what I just did is I went back and\nclicked on my main Microsoft window.\n\n159\n00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.470\nMy message window is still there.\n\n160\n00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.280\nYou can see down here in my\ntask bar that I've got two\n\n161\n00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.410\nwindows were opened up\nin this application.\n\n162\n00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.120\nI'm going to minimize Outlook,\nand just have the message.\n\n163\n00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.513\nCuz I work on multiple monitors and\nso I would have one over here and\n\n164\n00:09:44.513 --> 00:09:47.240\none over there and\nI could kinda move things around.\n\n165\n00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.990\nAnd so I have my File Explorer,\nor well it is the File Explorer.\n\n166\n00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:55.407\nThat's what it's technically called,\nWindows Explorer, whoops, sorry.\n\n167\n00:09:55.407 --> 00:09:59.172\nI forgot this computer's a little slower\nthan my other computer that's in the shop\n\n168\n00:09:59.172 --> 00:10:03.750\nright now, so I have to remember to let it\nbreathe a little bit like it's working.\n\n169\n00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.800\nIt's seven years old but\nit's still kicking pretty good.\n\n170\n00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.202\nSo we have here my\nFile Explorer in this email.\n\n171\n00:10:10.202 --> 00:10:13.230\nI have files in a folder called files and\n\n172\n00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:18.460\nI would like to send this Word\ndocument and this Excel file.\n\n173\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.560\nNow they're right next to each other,\nso I can use my Shift key or\n\n174\n00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.810\nmy Ctrl key to go ahead and\nselect multiple files.\n\n175\n00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.460\nShift would go ahead and\ngive you the range.\n\n176\n00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.290\nCtrl will be able to select files\nthat aren't next to each other.\n\n177\n00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.780\nSo, select all the files that I want.\n\n178\n00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.860\nIf I want those to be\nattachments into this message,\n\n179\n00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.080\nall I gotta do is drag and drop.\n\n180\n00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.250\nNow the thing is, you gotta be\ncareful where you drop it into.\n\n181\n00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:44.080\nSo if you drag it, I actually see,\nif I come down here, my mouse turns to\n\n182\n00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.850\na white arrow with a box over it,\nas opposed to here, with a no sign.\n\n183\n00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.570\nSo you do need to drop it\ninto the message body, but\n\n184\n00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.660\nyou're not actually putting\nit into the message body,\n\n185\n00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:58.640\nwatch what happens when I let go,\nit just adds itself as an attachment, fun!\n\n186\n00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.580\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love the drag and drop method,\n\n187\n00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.730\nbecause there's a lot of times,\n\n188\n00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.710\nif I'm sending multiple files\n&gt;&gt; Why don't I do it this way?\n\n189\n00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:08.030\nBecause then I can come back out\ninto here, take my pictures.\n\n190\n00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.300\nLet's say I wanna send all of these files.\n\n191\n00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:14.420\nI'm gonna click on one,\ndo a Ctrl+A for select all.\n\n192\n00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.420\nAnd I can then just drag and\ndrop those right into there.\n\n193\n00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.320\nMake sure I get it into it.\n\n194\n00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.580\n&gt;&gt; And then there we go.\n\n195\n00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.970\nPerfect.\nI can just drag and\n\n196\n00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:25.930\ndrop my attachments right into my composed\nmessage, or if it's a reply message, so\n\n197\n00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.480\nit doesn't always have\nto be a new message.\n\n198\n00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.690\nIt's just anytime you are writing or\n\n199\n00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:34.130\ncomposing a message that you want files\nattached, just drag those guys in there,\n\n200\n00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.800\nand then you could go ahead and\nsend it on your merry way.\n\n201\n00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:42.810\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust name this files, For you.\n\n202\n00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:48.790\nI think I already said that a couple of\ntimes but we'll just say files, that's it.\n\n203\n00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:52.023\nI'm not gonna do anything else with\nthis just so I can see if I can\n\n204\n00:11:52.023 --> 00:11:55.870\nshow you those auto save features,\nthis is gonna go in your drafts folder.\n\n205\n00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.900\nWell you have to wait a little bit, so\nI'm just gonna go ahead and minimize this.\n\n206\n00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:05.700\nAnd then we are going to bring back up\nour Outlook and then move on from there.\n\n207\n00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.286\nMultiple attachments,\nnow that was a way I could go ahead and\n\n208\n00:12:09.286 --> 00:12:12.462\nadd multiple attachments by dragging and\ndropping.\n\n209\n00:12:12.462 --> 00:12:15.530\nBut what if I receive\nmultiple attachments?\n\n210\n00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:21.150\nThere is a few things that you can do\nwith that and I actually have a message\n\n211\n00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:26.040\nthat has multiple photos and\nnow I have to of course remember which\n\n212\n00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:31.170\none it is and I think it was down here.\n\n213\n00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.620\n&gt;&gt; Yvonne, is there a way that we\ncan search for that email, perhaps?\n\n214\n00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.030\n&gt;&gt; We can,\nthere actually is a search capability.\n\n215\n00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.700\nThere's extensive search features in here.\n\n216\n00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:44.240\nWith mine, I would have Dash remember,\n[LAUGH] what the name of the emails or\n\n217\n00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:44.820\nsomething.\n\n218\n00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.995\nNow I could sort by attachments and\nsearch for multiple attachments, so\n\n219\n00:12:48.995 --> 00:12:50.782\nI could go ahead and find that.\n\n220\n00:12:50.782 --> 00:12:51.710\nBut you know what?\n\n221\n00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:54.000\nI actually did find it\nwhile you were talking.\n\n222\n00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.210\nI'm like there it is.\n\n223\n00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:59.180\nSo I did set this up to\ndemonstrate the fact of,\n\n224\n00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.600\nI've received multiple attachments and\nwhat can I do with it?\n\n225\n00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.710\nAnd this is actually from you, well.\n\n226\n00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:09.927\nYou'll know that you did that,\nyeah, [LAUGH], I actually did that.\n\n227\n00:13:09.927 --> 00:13:13.671\nSo I have my email from Lance and\nit's to me, and\n\n228\n00:13:13.671 --> 00:13:17.240\nyou can see that I've\ngot these couple guys.\n\n229\n00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:21.469\nAnd what I did is I had set\nup on Lance's computer,\n\n230\n00:13:21.469 --> 00:13:25.199\nmy virtual machine with Lance's account,\n\n231\n00:13:25.199 --> 00:13:31.530\nto set up Chris' account to be able\nto receive Gmail into Outlook.\n\n232\n00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:35.890\nLong story short, I took some\nscreenshots under that virtual machine.\n\n233\n00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:39.600\nI wanted to send it to Justin Timberlake,\nand\n\n234\n00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.020\nI figure it's a great way to\ndemonstrate multiple attachments.\n\n235\n00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.030\nSo we talked about how if I single-click\non it, I could see the preview.\n\n236\n00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.930\nI also could double click\non it to open it up.\n\n237\n00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:53.450\nNow, we also talked about how\nI could save the attachments,\n\n238\n00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.528\nbut I want to have all of\nthese attachments saved.\n\n239\n00:13:56.528 --> 00:13:59.382\nI don't wanna go to save,\nsave, save to three of them.\n\n240\n00:13:59.382 --> 00:14:02.830\nI might have 17 files attached here.\n\n241\n00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:07.090\nSo what you could do is you have\nthe option to go ahead and save all of\n\n242\n00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:12.558\nthe attachments as one file, so\nthat's the thing that I would like to do.\n\n243\n00:14:12.558 --> 00:14:15.720\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and just click\non one, and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n244\n00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.180\nsay save all attachments.\n\n245\n00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:22.150\nNow, notice that it's gonna go ahead and\nlist out the files attached in that email.\n\n246\n00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.774\nAnd I'm gonna say, yep,\nthat's what I want.\n\n247\n00:14:23.774 --> 00:14:24.920\nGo ahead and bring them all down.\n\n248\n00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:29.452\nAnd now, it's gonna ask me, well,\nwhere do you want to save them?\n\n249\n00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:34.711\nLet's go ahead and put that on the desktop\nfor now, and we'll go ahead and click OK.\n\n250\n00:14:34.711 --> 00:14:37.575\nAnd now let's go out and\ncheck out that desktop.\n\n251\n00:14:37.575 --> 00:14:42.020\nLet's go ahead and close this,\nlet's minimize this and minimize this.\n\n252\n00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:47.530\nYou can see right there that all\nof them are on my desktop here.\n\n253\n00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:50.010\nI will say that sometimes I've\nactually had them where there's so\n\n254\n00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:51.960\nmany it zips the file.\n\n255\n00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.970\nSo if you get multiple attachments and\nyou're like I don't see the files\n\n256\n00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.060\nindividually, you might\nsee a zipped folder.\n\n257\n00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:03.390\nThat has happened quite a few times\nto me in different scenarios.\n\n258\n00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:07.357\nI'm not sure if there's a threshold\nof when it zips the files.\n\n259\n00:15:07.357 --> 00:15:10.370\nI just know it's done both ways.\n\n260\n00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.590\nSo just in case, you can look at that.\n\n261\n00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.320\nI did wanna show you how you could\nsave multiple attachments here.\n\n262\n00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.304\nLet's see if we have gotten\npast that 3 minute mark.\n\n263\n00:15:19.304 --> 00:15:21.471\n&gt;&gt; All right\n&gt;&gt; When I talk about 3 minute,\n\n264\n00:15:21.471 --> 00:15:26.526\nthat was the time limit set on the auto\nsave feature of if I am in a Email\n\n265\n00:15:26.526 --> 00:15:31.250\nthat I have not sent yet, so\nlet's go check our Drafts folder.\n\n266\n00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:34.080\nThere it is, right there.\n\n267\n00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:39.420\nSo I can see that my file,\nit's still open over here, right,\n\n268\n00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:43.080\nbut it went ahead and did an auto save,\nand just kinda remembering.\n\n269\n00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.649\nAnd I've had that where I've, in the\nmiddle of an email, I'm typing, typing,\n\n270\n00:15:46.649 --> 00:15:49.822\ntyping away and I get a phone call,\nthat it always gets back that drafts.\n\n271\n00:15:49.822 --> 00:15:52.600\nAnd sometimes I'll go back\nin my drafts folder and\n\n272\n00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.123\nsee like a whole bunch\nof blank emails setup.\n\n273\n00:15:55.123 --> 00:15:58.259\nI was like whoops, okay,\nlet me go ahead and delete all of those.\n\n274\n00:15:58.259 --> 00:16:00.144\nSo the auto-save feature.\n\n275\n00:16:00.144 --> 00:16:03.850\nLet me go ahead and close this to\nshow you the different message.\n\n276\n00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.960\nWe have saved a draft of this message for\nyou.\n\n277\n00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.380\nDo you wanna keep it?\n\n278\n00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.330\nAnd that's wherever you were at,\nif you click save,\n\n279\n00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.800\nit's just gonna remember that state.\n\n280\n00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:18.570\nIt's kind of already in auto-save, but\nthis is like I'm now like committing to,\n\n281\n00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.392\nkeeping in the draft versus no, I'm good.\n\n282\n00:16:21.392 --> 00:16:23.460\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsay no, I don't need it and\n\n283\n00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.360\nyou can see that it goes ahead and\ntakes it out of the drafts folder.\n\n284\n00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.670\nSpeaking about deleting,\n\n285\n00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:34.600\nthat's one of the areas that we\nhaven't covered in our Email basics.\n\n286\n00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.350\nI don't need Emails in\nwhatever folder I'm in.\n\n287\n00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:42.570\nIt could be my inbox, it could be\nmy drafts, it could be my sent.\n\n288\n00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.530\nI don't normally delete things\nfrom my sent folder for\n\n289\n00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:49.050\nme because, I kind of need\na record of what I am sending, but\n\n290\n00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:53.490\nmy inbox is like, okay I don't need to\nknow that everybody had pizza on Friday.\n\n291\n00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:57.307\nI wasn't here on Friday, so I don't\nwanna hear about how delicious it was so\n\n292\n00:16:57.307 --> 00:16:59.178\nI'm gonna go ahead delete that out.\n\n293\n00:16:59.178 --> 00:17:02.930\nOr if I'm in my draft folder,\nthere is a save relater part two,\n\n294\n00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:08.058\nI don't really need that any more because\nI realized I didn't need to save that.\n\n295\n00:17:08.058 --> 00:17:11.213\nSo while I'm here,\nwhy don't I go ahead and delete it.\n\n296\n00:17:11.213 --> 00:17:15.491\nI'm gonna go ahead and I can click now,\nsince I am in the reading pane and\n\n297\n00:17:15.491 --> 00:17:20.341\nI'm looking at this saved draft, I can\nclick the discard button right here, and\n\n298\n00:17:20.341 --> 00:17:21.220\nit goes away.\n\n299\n00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:25.507\nThere's a lot of ways that you can delete,\nyou can hit the delete key on your\n\n300\n00:17:25.507 --> 00:17:29.931\nkeyboard, you can come up to the top in\nthe ribbon, you can right click on it,\n\n301\n00:17:29.931 --> 00:17:31.930\nyou can drag it into the trash can.\n\n302\n00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:36.600\nSo let's go over a couple of those\ndifferent ways, let's go with here,\n\n303\n00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.580\nlet's take this email from Lance,\nI can single click on it.\n\n304\n00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.350\nThere is the delete key up on\nthe Home tab of our ribbon,\n\n305\n00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:50.990\nI could also go ahead and take,\nhere, we'll do this particular one.\n\n306\n00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:57.640\nI'm going to right click on this and\nI will go ahead and delete here, perfect.\n\n307\n00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.460\nMaybe this one, let's take this one and\nlet's go ahead and\n\n308\n00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.380\nhit the Delete key on the keyboard.\n\n309\n00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.340\nNow, this one specifically is going\nto give me a different message,\n\n310\n00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.430\nbecause it's saying that this\nis part of a conversation.\n\n311\n00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.415\nRemember, the emails for you, that was\nthe one that you and I went back and\n\n312\n00:18:12.415 --> 00:18:15.655\nforth about bunnies, and\nyou thought that they were such vicious,\n\n313\n00:18:15.655 --> 00:18:16.850\nferocious animals\n&gt;&gt; They are.\n\n314\n00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:21.685\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so I have multiple messages\nin here because I have my grouped- as\n\n315\n00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:27.093\nconversations in my view, it's saying\ndo you wanna do this to all of them?\n\n316\n00:18:27.093 --> 00:18:31.413\nYeah, I wanna delete our entire\nconversation but if I didn't,\n\n317\n00:18:31.413 --> 00:18:36.453\nif I only wanna delete up pieces of\nthat conversation I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n318\n00:18:36.453 --> 00:18:40.940\ncancel this cuz I just change my\nmind instead, I do that sometime.\n\n319\n00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:45.714\nI'm going to expand this out and\nmaybe I wanna just say, I don't like that\n\n320\n00:18:45.714 --> 00:18:50.411\nlast one so I can write Click and\ndelete just that last email response that\n\n321\n00:18:50.411 --> 00:18:55.126\nI had gotten from Lance,about how\nbunnies are vicious animals, okay?\n\n322\n00:18:55.126 --> 00:18:58.400\nSo deleting parts of a conversation versus\n\n323\n00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.870\ncollapsed conversations and\ndeleting them from there.\n\n324\n00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.350\nSo it gives you different\nwarning messages.\n\n325\n00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:07.390\nThe other one I could do.\n\n326\n00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:10.470\nSo let's say this particular one here.\n\n327\n00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:15.770\nAll of these folders they,\nyou can drag and drop things between them.\n\n328\n00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.430\nSo if I took this, I could go ahead,\n\n329\n00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.815\nI forgot there's the x over there\non the right hand side too.\n\n330\n00:19:20.815 --> 00:19:21.315\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n331\n00:19:21.315 --> 00:19:22.380\nYou can take this and\n\n332\n00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.210\nI can drag it into my deleted items.\n\n333\n00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.700\nSo many different ways to\nget rid of things here.\n\n334\n00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.750\nBut, did they really go away?\n\n335\n00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:36.800\nNo, they're still in, that trash can.\n\n336\n00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.280\nIt's like,\nI threw something away, and oops.\n\n337\n00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.350\nI gotta go fish through the trash,\nget that piece of paper back out.\n\n338\n00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:45.480\nWe've all done it, especially it's really\nbad if there's like coffee grounds on top\n\n339\n00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.335\non it, and everything.\n\n340\n00:19:46.335 --> 00:19:47.680\n[LAUGH] It's kind of smelly,\n\n341\n00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.710\nso ew okay, what if I needed to\nget one of those emails back?\n\n342\n00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.360\nIt's a folder so we're gonna go ahead and\nclick over here and\n\n343\n00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.020\nthen look at all of the emails\nthat I have that I had deleted,\n\n344\n00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:01.020\nand maybe I'm thinking this is\nthe one from the draft load and\n\n345\n00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.980\nlike why is that bold versus the one\nthat's Lance, well Lance is already read.\n\n346\n00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:10.051\nThe files I hadn't really gone\nback to draft and opened it, so\n\n347\n00:20:10.051 --> 00:20:15.760\nit's showing as unread cuz well,\nI really didn't do anything with it.\n\n348\n00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.540\nI didn't read it and never kinda came\nto completion, so that's why its bold.\n\n349\n00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.760\nBut I really want to have this back.\n\n350\n00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.630\nI want to get it back to my drafts,\nlet's drag and drop it.\n\n351\n00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:29.680\nYou could, if you wanted to,\nyou could right click and go there.\n\n352\n00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.190\nI tend to prefer the drag methods.\n\n353\n00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:36.240\nIt's faster because if I want to\nmove it then I have to go back into\n\n354\n00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.840\nwhich folder do I want it to?\n\n355\n00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.510\nNow, it does say inbox right here.\n\n356\n00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.200\nBut, let's just drag it.\n\n357\n00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.700\nSo, click, hold, drag.\n\n358\n00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.660\nThe only thing about dragging is you have\nto make sure you drop it in the right\n\n359\n00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.490\nplace, so making sure I'm over the inbox.\n\n360\n00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:50.540\nI put it back into there, perfect.\n\n361\n00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.935\nAnd, I didn't really complete it so\nnot sure why dragged it into the inbox.\n\n362\n00:20:53.935 --> 00:20:56.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know what, that's okay.\n\n363\n00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.830\nHey, why don't you go to the inbox,\ntake this one and drag it into the drafts.\n\n364\n00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:01.680\nThat sounds good.\n\n365\n00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.270\nOkay, we're just having a drag and\ndrop party over here.\n\n366\n00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:07.010\nWe can go crazy with it.\n\n367\n00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:11.020\nSo, taking things out of\nthe trash is always a good thing.\n\n368\n00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.600\nI would go ahead and just keep on deleting\neverything, and once it gets to a certain\n\n369\n00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.310\npoint, it's like, you know what, I really\ndon't want any of these files anymore.\n\n370\n00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:20.210\nI want them to go away.\n\n371\n00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:24.270\nAnd this is also something that you\ngotta consider about your mailbox space.\n\n372\n00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:28.339\nIf you have space limitations in your\norganization where you can only keep\n\n373\n00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:33.000\none gig or 500 megabytes or what have you.\n\n374\n00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.980\nIf your trash can starts\ngetting filled up and\n\n375\n00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.140\nyou know you don't want those emails,\nyou should empty them.\n\n376\n00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:43.580\nNow when you empty your trash\nyou should consider that gone.\n\n377\n00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.640\nWe're just gonna go ahead and stop right\nthere, you should consider it gone.\n\n378\n00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.800\nCan you bring it back?\n\n379\n00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.880\nWell, we'll leave that for\nthe super techies.\n\n380\n00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.820\nSo we're gonna take our deleted items,\n\n381\n00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:58.424\nright clicking on the mailbox, well\nthat's not a mailbox, that's a folder.\n\n382\n00:21:58.424 --> 00:22:01.510\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That is the deleted items folder.\n\n383\n00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:06.720\nYou can see that you can go to empty\nfolder, like, empty the trash out,\n\n384\n00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.830\ntake it all the way to the landfill,\nand let's get rid of it.\n\n385\n00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:14.210\nSo if I empty the folder, it's going to\nsay, hey this will be permanently deleted.\n\n386\n00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.180\nAre you sure you wanna do that?\n\n387\n00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.030\nIt's nice that it does give us a warning.\n\n388\n00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:20.360\nJust in case we're like,\nooh no, well, maybe I shouldn't.\n\n389\n00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.250\nIn this case, yes, we want to.\n\n390\n00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.800\nWe'll go ahead and delete everything.\n\n391\n00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:29.130\nIf I had a lot of files or\nI'm sorry, emails in that folder,\n\n392\n00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:34.790\nit would start freeing up space and\nthat would be a very good thing.\n\n393\n00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:38.100\nSo delete once, it's not really gone.\n\n394\n00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.200\nEmpty the deleted, it's really gone.\n\n395\n00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:44.491\nAnd I believe that has covered I think,\n\n396\n00:22:44.491 --> 00:22:48.630\nall the topic for\nthis point of basic emails.\n\n397\n00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:51.340\nIf there's other ways to do\nthings that I haven't shown,\n\n398\n00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.740\nwell, you know what, there probably is.\n\n399\n00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.880\nThere's many, many different ways\nto get around this but hopefully\n\n400\n00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.300\nyou've gotten a good overview of getting\nstarted with emailing back and forth.\n\n401\n00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.390\nJust as a reminder,\nmake sure you check those options.\n\n402\n00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:08.230\nThe options can do so many things for\nyou, and configure things,\n\n403\n00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:11.510\nlike if it's starting to kind of annoy\nyou, go ahead and check those options.\n\n404\n00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:15.120\nI bet you there's something that will like\nturn it on or turn it off, and that will\n\n405\n00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:20.680\nmake it a little bit easier for you in\nthe way you want outlook to work for you.\n\n406\n00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.210\n&gt;&gt; Alright Von,\nthat sounds like a great place for\n\n407\n00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:26.290\nus to finish any last thoughts\nbefore we close out this episode.\n\n408\n00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:29.020\n&gt;&gt; You know there actually\nwas one thing that\n\n409\n00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.010\nI forgot that I wanna\ntalk to you guys about.\n\n410\n00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:35.030\nAnd that is about downloading\nimages in an email and\n\n411\n00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.920\ngetting that warning so\nlet me show you what I mean.\n\n412\n00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.940\nMaybe you guys have already seen this\nbefore, so let's go back into my inbox.\n\n413\n00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.650\nAnd I'm going to scroll down a little bit.\n\n414\n00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.667\nI have some things here from\nMicrosoft Services Team.\n\n415\n00:23:49.667 --> 00:23:52.706\nAnd they have something about I think\nyou were setting some stuff up on these\n\n416\n00:23:52.706 --> 00:23:53.774\naccounts,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n417\n00:23:53.774 --> 00:23:55.993\n&gt;&gt; When you were doing your\nOffice 365 admin show.\n\n418\n00:23:55.993 --> 00:23:58.201\nAnd so I wanted to show you\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n419\n00:23:58.201 --> 00:24:01.340\nI'm gonna open this up,\nit's this one right here.\n\n420\n00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.270\nBecause I've said, have you guys\never gotten this warning before?\n\n421\n00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:07.190\nWhere it's saying, hey, there are some\npictures that you need to download,\n\n422\n00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.550\nbut it didn't do it automatically.\n\n423\n00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:11.560\nWhat's going on here?\n\n424\n00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.550\nWell, let me open up the email, so\nwe can maybe see it a little bit better.\n\n425\n00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:18.456\nAnd a lot of times, there's a lot of\ntimes, I don't even think about it and\n\n426\n00:24:18.456 --> 00:24:19.350\nI click on it.\n\n427\n00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:21.860\nBut we should just go ahead and\nmention right here.\n\n428\n00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.980\nThat you do wanna make sure\nthat when you click on this,\n\n429\n00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.920\nthat you know where this is coming from.\n\n430\n00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.300\nThat this is a reliable source.\n\n431\n00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:35.480\nThis is one of those kind of\nphishing tactics that the bad guys,\n\n432\n00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.840\nexcuse me, are out there to try to\nphish out information from you.\n\n433\n00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.700\nAnd try to get you to connect,\nin a sense, for\n\n434\n00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.490\nthem to be able to take their information.\n\n435\n00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:45.520\nWon't go into major details on that.\n\n436\n00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.457\nWe actually do have some security shows,\n\n437\n00:24:47.457 --> 00:24:49.290\ntoo, that you might want\nto be able to watch on.\n\n438\n00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:53.440\nAnd user security, of how to keep yourself\nsafe in here, and this is one of them.\n\n439\n00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:57.510\nBut what is happening in this\nparticular email is that this company,\n\n440\n00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.030\nwhich is Microsoft.\n\n441\n00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:03.590\nThere's pictures that is\nin the body of this email,\n\n442\n00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.780\nwhich is in an HTML format,\nwhich is HyperText Markup Language.\n\n443\n00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:11.100\nWe'll talk a little bit more about email\nformats in our next episodes coming up.\n\n444\n00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:16.080\nBut this is written to where there's\ninformation in here that has pictures,\n\n445\n00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.920\nthat they're not embedded in the email.\n\n446\n00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.870\nWe're going to talk about inserting\nimages into an email, and\n\n447\n00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:25.000\nthen sending it off to\nsomebody by Insert Picture.\n\n448\n00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.123\nThat's different, the picture\nlives in the body of the email.\n\n449\n00:25:29.123 --> 00:25:33.747\nIn this sense, the pictures live outside,\nif you want to say.\n\n450\n00:25:33.747 --> 00:25:36.360\nThey live on a website,\nthey live on a web address.\n\n451\n00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:41.490\nAnd there's a link, they're linked images,\nthey're not embedded images.\n\n452\n00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:44.448\nWell the thing is here, the reason why\nit's giving me this warning is because\n\n453\n00:25:44.448 --> 00:25:46.560\nthey are outsider-linked to a website.\n\n454\n00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.350\nThat means that you need\nto make a connection,\n\n455\n00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.660\nto be able to retrieve those messages.\n\n456\n00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.690\nOr sorry, not message,\nthe images within this message.\n\n457\n00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:56.230\nSo you're establishing a connection,\n\n458\n00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.350\nyou can see right there with\nthat whole phishing scheme.\n\n459\n00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:02.750\nYou've established a connection, it could\nbe to a website that is there to collect\n\n460\n00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.660\ninformation without you even knowing it.\n\n461\n00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.320\nSo that's where you need to be\na little careful about that.\n\n462\n00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.830\nBut I wanted to give you\na little background as to how\n\n463\n00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:15.250\na message like this is built, and\nwhy it's giving me this warning.\n\n464\n00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:18.220\nIt's saying,\nyou want to download the pictures\n\n465\n00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:22.760\nfrom a site to this particular\nmessage onto your computer.\n\n466\n00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.930\nDo you want me to do this?\n\n467\n00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:28.360\nNow, this is from Microsoft,\nand I know it's from Microsoft.\n\n468\n00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.316\nSo if I click on it, yes,\nI would like to go ahead and do this.\n\n469\n00:26:31.316 --> 00:26:35.918\nAnd this is also where we start getting\ninto our Safe Senders list, and\n\n470\n00:26:35.918 --> 00:26:38.882\nthis will be tied into our junk mail and\nspam.\n\n471\n00:26:38.882 --> 00:26:43.849\nAbout, do you always want to accept\npictures from this particular domain, or\n\n472\n00:26:43.849 --> 00:26:45.215\nadd to Safe Senders?\n\n473\n00:26:45.215 --> 00:26:47.771\nBut again,\nmore on that in another episode.\n\n474\n00:26:47.771 --> 00:26:49.943\nBut right here,\nlet's just go ahead and say, yep.\n\n475\n00:26:49.943 --> 00:26:53.450\nLet's go ahead and download these\npictures for this particular email.\n\n476\n00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:59.120\nI wouldn't start changing the settings to\ndownload from any email that comes in.\n\n477\n00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.780\nBecause that's where you wanna\nkinda keep yourself safe.\n\n478\n00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.950\nTell me as I need, and\nthen I can say, there it is.\n\n479\n00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.430\nDownload the logo from\nthis particular web site.\n\n480\n00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.550\nAnd I think the other one's another logo,\nyep, there's the Microsoft logo.\n\n481\n00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:15.740\nSo just wanted to point that out, and\nto give you a little background on it.\n\n482\n00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:19.877\nAnd now I think I have covered\neverything that I wanted to,\n\n483\n00:27:19.877 --> 00:27:22.421\nin this part three of email basics.\n\n484\n00:27:22.421 --> 00:27:23.719\nAll right, Vonne, well,\n\n485\n00:27:23.719 --> 00:27:26.717\nthank you again for helping us\nto round out our knowledge here.\n\n486\n00:27:26.717 --> 00:27:31.580\nOn some of the basic emailing features\nthat are gonna be available in Outlook.\n\n487\n00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:35.740\nRemember that in this episode, we did talk\nabout some of the undeliverable messages,\n\n488\n00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.690\nand the information\nthat it shows us there.\n\n489\n00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.469\nWe also, of course,\ntook a look at attachments.\n\n490\n00:27:40.469 --> 00:27:44.024\nWhen you have multiple attachments, and\nwhat we do with multiple attachments.\n\n491\n00:27:44.024 --> 00:27:47.850\nNot only sending them, how to send them,\nwe can click and drop and drag.\n\n492\n00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:49.550\nAnd of course, even receiving them,\n\n493\n00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:53.150\nhow do we get all of those different\nimages back on to our computer?\n\n494\n00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:55.521\nAnd lastly here, different deleted emails.\n\n495\n00:27:55.521 --> 00:28:00.266\nAnd then Vonne also showed us some of the\ndifferences with the images that also come\n\n496\n00:28:00.266 --> 00:28:01.453\nin on emails, too.\n\n497\n00:28:01.453 --> 00:28:04.861\nSomething we have pay attention to and\nbe aware of.\n\n498\n00:28:04.861 --> 00:28:07.997\nBut that is a great place for\nus to also end this show, then.\n\n499\n00:28:07.997 --> 00:28:12.615\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Long.\n\n500\n00:28:12.615 --> 00:28:13.326\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n501\n00:28:13.326 --> 00:28:18.564\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here, for\n\n502\n00:28:18.564 --> 00:28:24.492\nmore Outlook 2016 shows.\n\n503\n00:28:24.492 --> 00:28:25.950\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.750\nWelcome to another great episode\nright here on OfficeProTV.\n\n2\n00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.150\nYou're watching the Outlook 2016 show.\n\n3\n00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.540\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.460\nAnd today, we're gonna be taking a look\nat formatting our email messages and\n\n5\n00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.660\nwhat we can do with that.\n\n6\n00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.030\nAnd here to help us to see some of\nthose details is Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.360\nVonne, welcome back to the studios.\n\n8\n00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.530\n&gt;&gt; Hello Ronnie, good to see you.\n\n9\n00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.670\n&gt;&gt; Goo to see you, too.\n\n10\n00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.370\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n11\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.490\nSo yes, we're gonna be formatting\nthe message body of our email.\n\n12\n00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.330\nNow, a lot of the things that we're\ngonna be going over in this episode, and\n\n13\n00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.940\nI'm assuming we're gonna go to a part two.\n\n14\n00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.870\nBecause I do have a lot to\ntalk about here, of it.\n\n15\n00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.860\nThese are going to be things\nthat I'm gonna go kind of fast.\n\n16\n00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.910\nI'm just going to identify where they are,\n\n17\n00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.440\ngive you a quick example of what\nthat particular formatting does.\n\n18\n00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.449\nAnd then we're gonna move on\nbecause everything that we're doing\n\n19\n00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.320\nhere in the message body\nis really part of Word.\n\n20\n00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.140\nCuz we talked about in some\nprevious episodes are referring to\n\n21\n00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.275\nWord being like the default\neditor of your Outlook messages.\n\n22\n00:01:04.275 --> 00:01:07.755\nAnd well its not really\nWord inside of Outlook,\n\n23\n00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:10.450\nits It's really all the same features.\n\n24\n00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.160\nAnd there's an extensive\namount of features and\n\n25\n00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.830\noptions within the composing\npart of your message.\n\n26\n00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.420\nSo I'm going to point some of those out.\n\n27\n00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.340\nBut you can really dive deep into some of\nthese things, and really customize it.\n\n28\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.050\nJust like we've come to find out\nin all of our other episodes of\n\n29\n00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.290\nwe have a lot of customizations\nwe can be doing in Outlook.\n\n30\n00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.010\nSo if you want a little bit more in depth\non things like paragraph formatting and\n\n31\n00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.920\nthe space after paragraph and the styles\nand how we can use styles and themes.\n\n32\n00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.400\nAre we using some terminology that we're\ngoing to be going into this episode?\n\n33\n00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.880\nWe do have an entire series on Word so\nyou can go ahead and\n\n34\n00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.141\ntake a little bit of more time to\nget through some of these concepts.\n\n35\n00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:55.100\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne, I remember\nwhen I first started using email.\n\n36\n00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.070\nThere was really none of this\nformatting in terms of email messages.\n\n37\n00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.560\nIt was simply typing on the screen and\njust pressing send.\n\n38\n00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.480\nAnd that was pretty much it.\n\n39\n00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.295\nSo where are we going to begin when\nwe start taking a look at formatting\n\n40\n00:02:06.295 --> 00:02:06.932\nour messages?\n\n41\n00:02:06.932 --> 00:02:10.195\n&gt;&gt; That is the most perfect\nplace to start, I think.\n\n42\n00:02:10.195 --> 00:02:14.280\nBecause we really need to talk about not\njust the things that we can do in Outlook.\n\n43\n00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.090\nTo begin with, we need to talk about\nthe difference between HTML formatting,\n\n44\n00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.130\nrich text formatting, and\nplain text formatting.\n\n45\n00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.180\nSo, while we gonna go and\nget in to the computer so\n\n46\n00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.610\nwe have just some type of video reference\n\n47\n00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.850\nto guide us along as we start talking\nabout some of these concepts.\n\n48\n00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.420\nJust to let you know where I am at,\nI'm in my drafts folder.\n\n49\n00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.630\nBecause I went ahead and got a message\nalready created with a bunch of text so\n\n50\n00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.690\nI have something in here\nto start formatting.\n\n51\n00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.610\nBecause you don't really want to see me\ntry to type out a really long passage\n\n52\n00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.510\nof text in here.\n\n53\n00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.840\nSo I took some placeholder texts, there\nare a lot of texts I've been using in my\n\n54\n00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.100\nepisodes to go ahead and get us started.\n\n55\n00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.080\nSo let me go ahead and\nopen up that message and\n\n56\n00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.950\nnow I'm in the actual message window.\n\n57\n00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.100\nAnd into the tabs along our ribbon\nthat we are going to be able to\n\n58\n00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.870\nuse to format everything.\n\n59\n00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:00.630\nSo where is that,\n\n60\n00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.860\nat the very beginning what format am I\nactually using to create my message?\n\n61\n00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.891\nI'm gonna jump over here\nto the Options tab.\n\n62\n00:03:09.891 --> 00:03:13.980\nNow, that's actually not the right one,\nthat's the Format text [LAUGH].\n\n63\n00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.236\nThe next tab over the Format text tab.\n\n64\n00:03:17.236 --> 00:03:20.845\nAnd a lot of the same things you see on\nthe Format text you will see a little bit\n\n65\n00:03:20.845 --> 00:03:21.666\non the message.\n\n66\n00:03:21.666 --> 00:03:25.320\nSo just you know, there's two different\nplaces where I can choose like fonts, and\n\n67\n00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.570\nbold, and italic, and things like that.\n\n68\n00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.370\nRight now, everything's grayed out.\n\n69\n00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.440\nThe reason is, is cuz I'm not actually\nclicked into the Message body.\n\n70\n00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.710\nI'm in the To field.\n\n71\n00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.650\nYou can't really format the To field.\n\n72\n00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.300\nIt's just, that's straight text.\n\n73\n00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.220\nSo let me click on down\nhere to go ahead and\n\n74\n00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.300\nactivate the different options\nwe have on our Ribbon.\n\n75\n00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.340\nSo right over here on the left hand\nside we can see that we have HTML,\n\n76\n00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.800\nPlain Text, and Rich Text, so\nwhat's the difference between these?\n\n77\n00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.617\nWe'll start with plain text.\n\n78\n00:03:52.617 --> 00:03:57.427\nEven if it's in the middle as your choice,\nI feel actually the bottom that's just in\n\n79\n00:03:57.427 --> 00:04:00.580\nme like a hierarchy,\nlike what the formatting can do.\n\n80\n00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.940\nWell, plain text is almost exactly\nlike what it says, it's plain text.\n\n81\n00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.290\nIt can only support things\nlike your characters, numbers,\n\n82\n00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.750\nalphanumerical characters and that's it.\n\n83\n00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.490\nYou can't make it a different font,\nyou can't make it a different size,\n\n84\n00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.810\nit's just text,\nno extra formatting on there.\n\n85\n00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.024\nRich text formatting is just\ntaking plain text one step up.\n\n86\n00:04:25.024 --> 00:04:29.860\nWhere you can do some of your formattings,\nlike some fonts, and some colors.\n\n87\n00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.880\nI believe you can do some spacing,\nnot spacing but a bold.\n\n88\n00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.350\nI know bold and italic, and\nthose are all character level formattings.\n\n89\n00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.040\nI think you can do centered.\n\n90\n00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.214\nAnd bullets possibly?\n\n91\n00:04:40.214 --> 00:04:41.213\nYou know what?\n\n92\n00:04:41.213 --> 00:04:41.945\nWe could check that out.\n\n93\n00:04:41.945 --> 00:04:43.036\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n94\n00:04:43.036 --> 00:04:45.747\n&gt;&gt; But what I'm trying to say is it's this\n\n95\n00:04:45.747 --> 00:04:47.810\none level up from plain text.\n\n96\n00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.870\nSo, there will be some formatting\nthat you will be able to\n\n97\n00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.390\ndo in your formatting because\nRich text will allow you.\n\n98\n00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.430\nThen the highest level is HTML formatting.\n\n99\n00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.460\nAnd HTML stands for\nHyperText Markup Language.\n\n100\n00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.960\nAnd it's using a series of tags and\ncodes to be able to format your message.\n\n101\n00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.810\nYou don't have to know\nanything about HTML.\n\n102\n00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.680\nYou don't even have to know what's a tag.\n\n103\n00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.590\nWhat?\nDon't worry about that.\n\n104\n00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.100\nIt's really just the most\nextensive type of formatting\n\n105\n00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.190\nthat you are allowed to do\nwhen composing a message.\n\n106\n00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.950\nAnd that's the default mode\nthat your email editor or\n\n107\n00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.310\ncomposing your messages\nare going to be in.\n\n108\n00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.780\nAnd so\nthat's the one that we're going to do.\n\n109\n00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.010\nNow, why does this make a difference?\n\n110\n00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.630\nYou're like, well,\n\n111\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.230\nI should always use HTML, because that\ngives me everything that I want to do.\n\n112\n00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.150\nWell, you have to remember that we're\nnot the only people using Outlook.\n\n113\n00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.220\nAnd there's other people that use Outlook,\nbut\n\n114\n00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.620\nthere are a bunch of other type\nof mail servers that you can use.\n\n115\n00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.888\nI mean, there's Gmail, there's Yahoo,\nthere's old versions of thing,\n\n116\n00:05:49.888 --> 00:05:53.440\nI mean there's all sorts of\ndifferent levels of mail servers.\n\n117\n00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.130\nAnd what those servers are configured\nto allow your messages to be.\n\n118\n00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.430\nAnd I say, it's a big difference.\n\n119\n00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.068\nSo I can go ahead,\nI have always capabilities.\n\n120\n00:06:02.068 --> 00:06:06.746\nBut I might be sending somebody with an\nemail that they've actually configured it\n\n121\n00:06:06.746 --> 00:06:09.810\nto where they won't allow\nany HTML to come into them.\n\n122\n00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.270\nThey only want plain text because of\nmaybe they have slow connections.\n\n123\n00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.730\nI mean, there's a whole myriad of reasons\nwhy people want to use plain text.\n\n124\n00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.920\nAlso security reasons, right?\n\n125\n00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.420\nBecause if it was plain text,\nthere's not any links of the emails.\n\n126\n00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.440\nWe talked about downloading the pictures\nthat could be some issues with\n\n127\n00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.260\nthe security.\n\n128\n00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.354\nSo, it's not just you\nyou have to think about.\n\n129\n00:06:32.354 --> 00:06:36.361\nYou have to think of the recipient,\nthe person on the other end, and\n\n130\n00:06:36.361 --> 00:06:38.345\nwhat they could or could not see.\n\n131\n00:06:38.345 --> 00:06:43.610\nAnd you kind of have to make that\ndecision as to which one you want to do.\n\n132\n00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.340\n&gt;&gt; Vonne,\nI think that that makes a very good point.\n\n133\n00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.920\nNormally, I won't say best practice,\nbut the protocol or\n\n134\n00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.920\nthe etiquette behind this is simple.\n\n135\n00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.440\nIf you get an email message and\nit's in plain text, usually what you\n\n136\n00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.750\nwant to respond with is a plain text\nemail, is what it comes down to.\n\n137\n00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.870\nIf you get one in rich text,\nusually it's trying to do the same thing.\n\n138\n00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.640\nSo that way, on their end, if there is\na limitation like Vonne was explaining,\n\n139\n00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.470\nthat you're not trapped.\n\n140\n00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.250\nBecause you sent something in a higher\nformat than what their email server\n\n141\n00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.640\nis going to handle.\n\n142\n00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.180\nSo that's at least what we would call that\nprotocol or that etiquette to be able\n\n143\n00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.920\nto do that is that you want to\nsend it in the same manner.\n\n144\n00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.739\nYou may even get unusual messages\nthat return back to you that says,\n\n145\n00:07:24.739 --> 00:07:29.568\nyour email was rejected because we don't\ntake anything but plain text, sometimes.\n\n146\n00:07:29.568 --> 00:07:32.478\nAnd I've seen a couple of\ncompanies like that before.\n\n147\n00:07:32.478 --> 00:07:36.089\nBut that's just kind of a nice\nlittle basic way if you're going,\n\n148\n00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:38.133\nwhen should I choose which one to do.\n\n149\n00:07:38.133 --> 00:07:41.779\nWell, if you get it that way,\nsend it back in that particular format.\n\n150\n00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:43.659\nAnd that probably helps\nthem out at the same time.\n\n151\n00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:45.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a really great point.\n\n152\n00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.790\nIt's, don't do something that they can't.\n\n153\n00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:49.320\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n154\n00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.370\n&gt;&gt; So really great point.\n\n155\n00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.410\nI really appreciate that Ronnie because\nit is nice etiquette, so [LAUGH]\n\n156\n00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.032\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n157\n00:07:55.032 --> 00:07:57.057\n&gt;&gt; But we are going to go ahead and\n\n158\n00:07:57.057 --> 00:08:01.514\nuse that HTML formatting to be able\nto see the capabilities of what\n\n159\n00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:03.065\nOutlook can do for us.\n\n160\n00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:07.654\nAnd we're also gonna take it to our,\nI wanna call it HTML extended,\n\n161\n00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:10.483\nthat doesn't really exist in real life.\n\n162\n00:08:10.483 --> 00:08:15.256\nBut we're gonna be doing things to where\nwere gonna be entering smart art, and\n\n163\n00:08:15.256 --> 00:08:19.810\nwe're gonna be entering some charts,\nand graphs, and things like that,\n\n164\n00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.796\nthat are very,\nI would say Microsoft specific.\n\n165\n00:08:22.796 --> 00:08:27.663\nAnd Microsoft Exchange specific, and yeah,\nI would say it that way, because anybody\n\n166\n00:08:27.663 --> 00:08:31.462\nthat's on the R same server,\nthey would probably be able to see it,\n\n167\n00:08:31.462 --> 00:08:35.710\nagain if they have configured\ntheir email client to allow that.\n\n168\n00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:40.690\nSo we'll be doing things that\nare very kind of exclusive,\n\n169\n00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.020\nso use them accordingly,\nand remember your audience.\n\n170\n00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.577\nWho are you targeting,\nwho are you trying to email and\n\n171\n00:08:47.577 --> 00:08:51.938\njust kind of know when and\nwhere to use all of these capabilities.\n\n172\n00:08:51.938 --> 00:08:55.091\nAll right, perfect, so\nlet's go ahead, get back into here.\n\n173\n00:08:55.091 --> 00:08:58.655\nAnd on our format tab,\ntypes of formatting that you have,\n\n174\n00:08:58.655 --> 00:09:04.310\nthere's character level formatting and\nthere's paragraph level formatting.\n\n175\n00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:09.250\nEasiest way to kind of demonstrate that,\nanything in this box over here,\n\n176\n00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.510\nthe font group,\nthat's character level formatting.\n\n177\n00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.870\nAnything over here,\nmost anything over here,\n\n178\n00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.110\nthat's gonna be paragraph\nlevel formatting.\n\n179\n00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:23.180\nIt's whether the formatting is associated\nwith the words or the paragraph itself.\n\n180\n00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.670\nWhen you actually hit the enter key on\nthe keyboard, that creates a paragraph and\n\n181\n00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.240\nwhat formatting is going\nto adhere to each part.\n\n182\n00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.950\nSo let's start at the beginning of\ndoing character level formatting.\n\n183\n00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.460\nI wanna change font, size, color, bold,\n\n184\n00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:44.610\nitalics, underline, change case, all of\nthese different buttons right in here.\n\n185\n00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.030\nSo I want the text to look a little bit\ndifferent, so let's drop this down and\n\n186\n00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.000\nlet's use our text.\n\n187\n00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.845\nWe have that auto preview,\nthe previewing of our different fonts and\n\n188\n00:09:54.845 --> 00:09:58.789\nlet's go with good old\nBernard MT Condensed.\n\n189\n00:09:58.789 --> 00:10:00.192\nI just don't wanna\nscroll down any further.\n\n190\n00:10:00.192 --> 00:10:04.611\n[LAUGH] So we'll go there, we could go\nahead and make our font size bigger and\n\n191\n00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:06.130\nsmaller.\n\n192\n00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.841\nWe have our little bumpy arrows,\nthat's what I call them.\n\n193\n00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:14.001\n[LAUGH] Their technical names is increase\nfont size and decrease font size.\n\n194\n00:10:14.001 --> 00:10:18.192\nI really love this button, this is\nprobably one of my favorite buttons in\n\n195\n00:10:18.192 --> 00:10:22.606\nall of Office, is being able to change\nthings from upper case to lower case.\n\n196\n00:10:22.606 --> 00:10:26.097\nAs opposed to like backspacing over it and\nthen having to retype it,\n\n197\n00:10:26.097 --> 00:10:28.560\nlike not with the Caps Lock.\n\n198\n00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:34.246\nSo I love that change case, so maybe I'll\ngo ahead and make it all upper case and\n\n199\n00:10:34.246 --> 00:10:39.264\nbold, italic, underline,\nthese are also like on and off buttons.\n\n200\n00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:43.562\nIf I make it italic,\nthen how do I make it not italic?\n\n201\n00:10:43.562 --> 00:10:47.310\nWith the text selected, I would go\nahead and then turn the button off.\n\n202\n00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.200\nSo I can make it bold, make it underlined.\n\n203\n00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.023\nSomething about making things underlined,\nyou might want to avoid that.\n\n204\n00:10:54.023 --> 00:10:54.739\nCuz Ronnie,\n\n205\n00:10:54.739 --> 00:10:59.048\nwhat do you usually think of when you\nhave text that's underlined sometimes.\n\n206\n00:10:59.048 --> 00:11:00.347\n&gt;&gt; Links?\n\n207\n00:11:00.347 --> 00:11:01.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, hyperlinks.\n\n208\n00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.310\nSo someone might be clicking on that,\nbut like, why isn't that going anywhere?\n\n209\n00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.195\nEspecially if it's blue, then-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n210\n00:11:06.195 --> 00:11:09.650\n&gt;&gt; You're really,\nyou're throwing them off a little bit.\n\n211\n00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.430\nI've done it many times,\nlike why did you format it that way?\n\n212\n00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.180\nBut that's just me.\n\n213\n00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.730\nSo there we go,\nwe have superscript, subscript, and\n\n214\n00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.238\nthen we have highlighting,\nand then we have font color.\n\n215\n00:11:20.238 --> 00:11:23.760\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nmaybe I'll pick a color in here.\n\n216\n00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.200\nNow these are pulling off of a theme.\n\n217\n00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.580\nYou are more than welcome\nto change your theme.\n\n218\n00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.000\nThink about a theme like a party theme,\nright?\n\n219\n00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.650\nSay we're going to a My Little Pony party,\nright, Ronnie?\n\n220\n00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:34.396\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n221\n00:11:34.396 --> 00:11:37.099\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I know you would love to\ncome to my little pony party.\n\n222\n00:11:37.099 --> 00:11:37.929\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.\n\n223\n00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:41.615\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I wanna have everything\npinks and purples, and light blues and\n\n224\n00:11:41.615 --> 00:11:42.610\nthings like that.\n\n225\n00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:43.576\n&gt;&gt; Catch me on the weekend.\n\n226\n00:11:43.576 --> 00:11:45.417\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, you and your party hat.\n\n227\n00:11:45.417 --> 00:11:46.604\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n228\n00:11:46.604 --> 00:11:48.552\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So you can go ahead and\n\n229\n00:11:48.552 --> 00:11:54.230\nchoose what theme and even taking that\na little bit extended to where the fonts,\n\n230\n00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:58.888\nand like I had a certain set of fonts\nthat I wanted to choose from and\n\n231\n00:11:58.888 --> 00:12:00.570\ncertain colors.\n\n232\n00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.450\nAll of these types of things,\nthese are all part of your themes.\n\n233\n00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:06.910\nSince I'm mentioning this,\nwhere do you go to find that?\n\n234\n00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:11.280\nYou go over into your options, and\nthen your options tab right over here.\n\n235\n00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.370\nSo you have your themes that go with\nthe color, and the font scheme.\n\n236\n00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.340\nBut then you can go ahead and\npick them individually as well.\n\n237\n00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:25.660\nYou can choose colors separately than your\nfonts, and different than your effects.\n\n238\n00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.320\nThe effects of where you're going to\nput on effects with your pictures and\n\n239\n00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.610\nyour smart art.\n\n240\n00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.200\nSo all the different things.\n\n241\n00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.752\nSo you're more than welcome\nto change whatever themes,\n\n242\n00:12:34.752 --> 00:12:38.060\nsince I talked about My Little Pony,\nlet's go with that red violet them.\n\n243\n00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:43.368\nSo if I come back over to my format text\nin my colors, notice that these themes and\n\n244\n00:12:43.368 --> 00:12:47.887\nthe different variances on those\nparticular colors will come up for\n\n245\n00:12:47.887 --> 00:12:49.489\nme to be able to choose.\n\n246\n00:12:49.489 --> 00:12:53.870\nSo let's go with some pink right there,\nlove that.\n\n247\n00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.580\nAnd there we have our font formatting.\n\n248\n00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.680\nCharacter level, no, not character,\nI just finished character didn't I?\n\n249\n00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.680\nParagraph level formatting, changing\nthe differences of our whole paragraphs.\n\n250\n00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.320\nEvery time you hit that enter key.\n\n251\n00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.960\nThis is also one of my most\nfavorite buttons in all of Office,\n\n252\n00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.370\nis a show hide character marks.\n\n253\n00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:19.270\nAnytime that somebody or whoever has\nimputed this, they use a spacebar,\n\n254\n00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.910\nor they'll use a tab.\n\n255\n00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:25.420\nWhether they use a line\nbreak versus a enter.\n\n256\n00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.710\nSo like a softer term\nversus a harder term.\n\n257\n00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:33.350\nThat all makes a huge difference in\nhow you're gonna be formatting things.\n\n258\n00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.425\nI've done a lot of things with\ntype setting and laying out,\n\n259\n00:13:36.425 --> 00:13:37.550\nlike full text books.\n\n260\n00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:41.690\nSo I need this,\nI need to see every single little parts.\n\n261\n00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.662\nAny one that does double\nEnters after a paragraph.\n\n262\n00:13:44.662 --> 00:13:48.065\nNo, cuz I wanna format things\nwith space after paragraphs and\n\n263\n00:13:48.065 --> 00:13:50.759\nif you have double Enters,\nit throws me all off.\n\n264\n00:13:50.759 --> 00:13:53.570\nBut I digress, yet again.\n\n265\n00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:58.145\nBut just wanted to let you all know here,\nso I'm gonna click on that, and\n\n266\n00:13:58.145 --> 00:14:01.150\nI have everywhere that I\ncan see my paragraphs.\n\n267\n00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:06.983\nSome basic paragraph formatting that maybe\na lot of people aren't familiar with,\n\n268\n00:14:06.983 --> 00:14:08.231\nbullets and numbering.\n\n269\n00:14:08.231 --> 00:14:11.277\nI want to make a list of items here.\n\n270\n00:14:11.277 --> 00:14:15.690\nI take my selected paragraph,\ncuz you always want select an effect.\n\n271\n00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.870\nI'm gonna click on this button\nright here where it says bullets.\n\n272\n00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.460\nI have choices of bullets.\n\n273\n00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.462\nI could go and format my bullets,\nI can make little pictures.\n\n274\n00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:26.643\nI could do all sorts of different\nthings with defining a new bullet, but\n\n275\n00:14:26.643 --> 00:14:28.615\nlet's just take whatever we've got here.\n\n276\n00:14:28.615 --> 00:14:30.510\nLet's make some check marks there.\n\n277\n00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:31.780\nI'll have some check boxes here.\n\n278\n00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:37.110\nSome other things with paragraph\nlevel formatting, spacing.\n\n279\n00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.940\nI already started hinting at that,\n\n280\n00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:43.860\nthe double enters of space\nbetween the paragraphs.\n\n281\n00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.190\nNot the lines, the paragraphs.\n\n282\n00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:50.070\nBut notice, they put it together\nas line and paragraph spacing.\n\n283\n00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.520\nTwo different things.\n\n284\n00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.650\nI'm going to change this and I will,\nnow if I use the double spacing,\n\n285\n00:14:55.650 --> 00:15:02.640\ndouble spacing like, okay well that looks\nthe same as if I went to add space after.\n\n286\n00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.970\nRight now its looking that way,\n\n287\n00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:08.900\nbecause I have paragraphs that\nare only a couple words long.\n\n288\n00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.280\nLet's add this.\n\n289\n00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.850\nLet me change it here to where\nI have these two paragraphs.\n\n290\n00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.030\nLet me go ahead and select this.\n\n291\n00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:23.460\nI'm gonna change the line spacing, cuz\nthese numbers here are the spaces between\n\n292\n00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:29.080\nthe lines versus add a space after or\nbefore the paragraphs.\n\n293\n00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.340\nI think this is the biggest demonstration\nof the differences between line spacing\n\n294\n00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.500\nand paragraph spacing.\n\n295\n00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.100\nSometimes it appears it looks the same,\nbut it's not.\n\n296\n00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.501\nThey're very different concepts.\n\n297\n00:15:40.501 --> 00:15:42.947\nSo lines or paragraphs and\n\n298\n00:15:42.947 --> 00:15:48.626\nhow you can kind of let the text breathe,\nas I like to call it.\n\n299\n00:15:48.626 --> 00:15:52.637\nYou also have left, right,\ncenter, fully justified text.\n\n300\n00:15:52.637 --> 00:15:56.512\nSo the different ways that you\ncan align your paragraphs.\n\n301\n00:15:56.512 --> 00:16:00.291\nMaybe I'd like to have this title here,\nwell we're calling it a title.\n\n302\n00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:04.807\nWe'll go ahead and move that over into\nthe middle, so I have it center aligned.\n\n303\n00:16:04.807 --> 00:16:07.571\nYou also have tabs and indents.\n\n304\n00:16:07.571 --> 00:16:10.439\nReally quickly, what is an indent mean?\n\n305\n00:16:10.439 --> 00:16:11.762\nMove it in.\n\n306\n00:16:11.762 --> 00:16:13.004\nI call it outdent.\n\n307\n00:16:13.004 --> 00:16:17.521\nOutdent would be out denting it, so these\nlittle buttons here, we'll go ahead and\n\n308\n00:16:17.521 --> 00:16:18.966\nincrease the indent.\n\n309\n00:16:18.966 --> 00:16:21.720\nI have that paragraph selected as well,\nthose are your buttons here.\n\n310\n00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.358\nAnd if you did have things that needed\nto be sorted, you could go ahead and\n\n311\n00:16:25.358 --> 00:16:26.444\nsort by a paragraph.\n\n312\n00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:32.170\nSo quick overview of everything that's\ngoing on in most of all the buttons here.\n\n313\n00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.887\nWe do have this button here of the\nshading, the shading will then shade like\n\n314\n00:16:35.887 --> 00:16:39.200\nthe background of the paragraph\nnot the page, not the words.\n\n315\n00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:44.445\nCuz this fill button, as I call it,\nversus the highlight button.\n\n316\n00:16:44.445 --> 00:16:50.680\nThey look similar but against,\nwhat level of formatting are your doing?\n\n317\n00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:55.340\nThe everything if I just single click in\nthis paragraph and then use the bucket,\n\n318\n00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:59.020\nyou see how I didn't even have\nto select the text, did I?\n\n319\n00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.553\nBecause my cursor is in the paragraph.\n\n320\n00:17:00.553 --> 00:17:04.757\nWhen you're doing paragraph-level\nformatting as long as you're in\n\n321\n00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:10.470\nthe paragraph, and choose that formatting,\nit will apply to the whole paragraph.\n\n322\n00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.922\nIf I try to do the highlighter here,\nit wouldn't do anything,\n\n323\n00:17:13.922 --> 00:17:17.507\nbecause I would have to make sure\nthat I am selecting the words that\n\n324\n00:17:17.507 --> 00:17:21.695\nneed highlighting, versus the background\nor fill color of the paragraph.\n\n325\n00:17:23.367 --> 00:17:25.640\nAnd then this is the border button.\n\n326\n00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.760\nThis is to where you could go ahead and\nadd a bottom border to that paragraph.\n\n327\n00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:36.180\nIt's not a line,\nit is a border on the paragraph, so\n\n328\n00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.980\nyou could go ahead and\nuse some of those, all right.\n\n329\n00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.437\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, I think this is\na good point for us to try and\n\n330\n00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:44.196\nlook at the screen here just briefly.\n\n331\n00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:47.879\nYou may actually find, if you're trying\nto follow along and you're saying,\n\n332\n00:17:47.879 --> 00:17:51.421\nyeah that looks great, but why is my\nscreen not looking the same as Vonne's?\n\n333\n00:17:51.421 --> 00:17:54.383\nAnd that is because the resolution\non Vonne's is set just a little bit\n\n334\n00:17:54.383 --> 00:17:55.924\nlower than what you might have set.\n\n335\n00:17:55.924 --> 00:18:00.044\nSo you might also be seeing words besides\nthe buttons that Vonne has been clicking\n\n336\n00:18:00.044 --> 00:18:04.526\non, so don't get alarm but you're saying,\nI want mine to look exactly like Vonne's,\n\n337\n00:18:04.526 --> 00:18:07.540\nwell you have to really\nreduce your resolution down.\n\n338\n00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.490\nThis is so\nyour not squinting at the same time,\n\n339\n00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.297\nthat you're also watching this episode.\n\n340\n00:18:11.297 --> 00:18:13.310\nSo, don't get alarmed by it.\n\n341\n00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:16.576\nAs you hover over them, if you don't have\nthe words just like what Vonne was doing,\n\n342\n00:18:16.576 --> 00:18:19.437\nyou'll get this, I think it's called\na tooltip, if I remember right.\n\n343\n00:18:19.437 --> 00:18:21.630\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n&gt;&gt; You'll get these tooltip and\n\n344\n00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:25.240\nthey'll kind of line up with the words\nthat you're probably seeing in\n\n345\n00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.720\nthe button that you're actually\nhovering over at the same time, so.\n\n346\n00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.098\nJust a nice little pointer just in\ncase you are trying to follow along at\n\n347\n00:18:33.098 --> 00:18:33.849\nthe same time.\n\n348\n00:18:33.849 --> 00:18:36.647\n&gt;&gt; That's a great point, in the sense\nI've been looking at the screen for so\n\n349\n00:18:36.647 --> 00:18:37.652\nlong in this resolution.\n\n350\n00:18:37.652 --> 00:18:39.881\nI've gotten used to what\nthe buttons look like.\n\n351\n00:18:39.881 --> 00:18:40.412\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n352\n00:18:40.412 --> 00:18:44.947\n&gt;&gt; We talked about our dynamic ribbon\nsizing when you have resolution.\n\n353\n00:18:44.947 --> 00:18:48.580\nI thnk one of the webinar outlook\ninterface [INAUDIBLE] in one point.\n\n354\n00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.134\nI might have made mention\nto really quickly but\n\n355\n00:18:51.134 --> 00:18:55.281\nI'm really glad you point that out\nbecause, mine doesn't look the same.\n\n356\n00:18:55.281 --> 00:18:57.323\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's supposed to look that way.\n\n357\n00:18:57.323 --> 00:19:00.642\nSo we've gone over our\ncharacter level formatting,\n\n358\n00:19:00.642 --> 00:19:05.362\nour paragraph level formatting,\npretty glossing over it like just going,\n\n359\n00:19:05.362 --> 00:19:07.955\nlet's go, I do wanna talk about styles.\n\n360\n00:19:09.358 --> 00:19:13.896\nWe talked about themes, with our color\nthemes, we went over to our options, and\n\n361\n00:19:13.896 --> 00:19:17.631\nthen, what type of fonts that I\nwould like to use in my document, or\n\n362\n00:19:17.631 --> 00:19:20.210\nat least the ones that\ncan be available to me.\n\n363\n00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:25.540\nNotice if I come over to the options and\nfonts, it's changing everything in\n\n364\n00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:30.840\nmy document or my email, I guess I should\nsay, to where I'm picking a font theme.\n\n365\n00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:35.852\nAlong that same line of a theme that\neverything is set with specific colors and\n\n366\n00:19:35.852 --> 00:19:39.530\nyou have matching hats, of course\nI'm still going with my little pony.\n\n367\n00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:43.717\n[LAUGH] That hats and the plates and\neverything matches, they're set.\n\n368\n00:19:43.717 --> 00:19:47.721\nIt's similar,\nit's not exactly as in but difference.\n\n369\n00:19:47.721 --> 00:19:48.236\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n370\n00:19:48.236 --> 00:19:52.063\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Styles, styles is just a named,\n\n371\n00:19:52.063 --> 00:19:54.520\nnamed group of formating.\n\n372\n00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.592\nHeading one, heading two,\ntitles, subtitles,\n\n373\n00:19:58.592 --> 00:20:03.680\nthese are all the different\nformatings under the named name.\n\n374\n00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.860\nHeading one would maybe be a little\nbit bigger, a little bolder,\n\n375\n00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.810\ndifferent color, maybe even\na different font than your normal.\n\n376\n00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:15.628\nNormal is your default style in all of\nyour emailing when you first start in HTML\n\n377\n00:20:15.628 --> 00:20:16.513\nformatting.\n\n378\n00:20:18.011 --> 00:20:19.675\nWhen you start moving around,\n\n379\n00:20:19.675 --> 00:20:23.643\nthen it takes Normal with all of these\nwhat are known as local formats, and\n\n380\n00:20:23.643 --> 00:20:28.320\nsometimes when you keep the local formats,\nand you hit enter, it retains all of that.\n\n381\n00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.380\nI know, since I know styles,\nand I love styles.\n\n382\n00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.550\nI think they're great.\n\n383\n00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:37.510\nWhen I start doing style overrides\nthat local formatting of, for example,\n\n384\n00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:40.360\nthis would be local formatting.\n\n385\n00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.150\nIf I took my cursor here\nfrom this paragraph and\n\n386\n00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:46.240\nI hit enter,\nit stays within that formatting.\n\n387\n00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:51.130\nSo maybe you've encountered and\nI wanna hit enter, and I want it to stop\n\n388\n00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:55.170\ndoing that, because maybe you're\nformatting as you type, as I call it.\n\n389\n00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:57.465\nWell, not what I call it,\nit's what you are doing.\n\n390\n00:20:57.465 --> 00:21:00.084\n[LAUGH] When you hit enter,\nit's remembering that formatting.\n\n391\n00:21:00.084 --> 00:21:04.930\nSo to try to get it back\nto stop doing all of this.\n\n392\n00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:09.420\nIf you come up to your styles and\nclick Normal, it removes all of\n\n393\n00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.170\nthe local formatting, cuz we made it pink,\nmade it bigger, and made it centered.\n\n394\n00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:17.860\nAnd it takes you back to normal,\ngets you to your starting point again.\n\n395\n00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.700\nAnd then you can move on and\nformat from there.\n\n396\n00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:26.300\nSo styles are very important, and\nthey're everywhere in Word/Outlook.\n\n397\n00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.551\nSo being aware of them and understanding\nto, even if you just get back to normal,\n\n398\n00:21:30.551 --> 00:21:33.694\n[COUGH] it goes ahead and\nclears everything, you're good.\n\n399\n00:21:33.694 --> 00:21:38.541\nThe other thing that's nice is, you can\nuse these styles that are already built\n\n400\n00:21:38.541 --> 00:21:42.230\ninto here to do some kind\nof quick level formatting.\n\n401\n00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.406\nIf I had multiple headings,\nI only have one right now,\n\n402\n00:21:45.406 --> 00:21:47.415\nI wanted them to all look the same.\n\n403\n00:21:47.415 --> 00:21:51.534\nYou could select the text and\nquickly click Heading one, and\n\n404\n00:21:51.534 --> 00:21:53.730\nthen it makes that as a heading.\n\n405\n00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:57.530\nLet's pretend that this here\nis going to be that heading.\n\n406\n00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.450\nI select that, and\nthen I chose Heading one.\n\n407\n00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.254\nNotice how the paragraph formatting or\nspacing,\n\n408\n00:22:03.254 --> 00:22:07.658\nit removes the space after it made a\ncertain size, it made a certain color, and\n\n409\n00:22:07.658 --> 00:22:11.110\nyou could go ahead and\nquickly format all of that.\n\n410\n00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.950\nI love styles, I think they're fantastic.\n\n411\n00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:18.070\nIf you just understand that they do exist,\nand that you can use them,\n\n412\n00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:21.570\nand they are already kind of\npre-loaded if you wanna say,\n\n413\n00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.720\nuse them, use them to your advantage.\n\n414\n00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:29.700\nAnd if you did go over to your Options and\nstart changing your themes, because your\n\n415\n00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:34.770\nusing styles, it's going to say that, all\nof the formats that are associated with\n\n416\n00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:40.452\nthat theme is going to apply to anything\nthat you have formatted with a style.\n\n417\n00:22:40.452 --> 00:22:47.005\nSo, style a name group of formatting that\nyou can use to quickly format your text.\n\n418\n00:22:47.005 --> 00:22:49.510\n&gt;&gt; Vonne,\nI really agree that the idea styles\n\n419\n00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:53.800\nhelp us especially on these long\ntypes of emails, where we can make it\n\n420\n00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.500\nfairly consistent without having to\ndo a lot of work to make that happen.\n\n421\n00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:02.405\nSo now that we have a little bit of sense\non what we can do on the character and\n\n422\n00:23:02.405 --> 00:23:05.255\nthe paragraph level formatting, Vonne,\n\n423\n00:23:05.255 --> 00:23:09.926\nwhat are some of the other tools that\nwe need to know that really helps in\n\n424\n00:23:09.926 --> 00:23:14.311\nour formatting, so that we actually\nhave great looking emails?\n\n425\n00:23:14.311 --> 00:23:17.806\n&gt;&gt; All of the auto things that,\nauto things [LAUGH].\n\n426\n00:23:17.806 --> 00:23:18.464\n&gt;&gt; Auto bots.\n\n427\n00:23:18.464 --> 00:23:22.614\n&gt;&gt; Auto things that happen in Outlook,\nwe have auto correct,\n\n428\n00:23:22.614 --> 00:23:25.530\nauto format as you type, auto spelling.\n\n429\n00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.169\nLet me show you, if I scroll on down,\nI made a little heading.\n\n430\n00:23:30.169 --> 00:23:36.230\nWhy don't we go ahead and\nformat with a Heading one, use our style.\n\n431\n00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:40.220\nI already had an enter mark after\nthat to put me back into the normal.\n\n432\n00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.353\nBut if I had clicked from here and\nhit enter, I'd have to hit that normal,\n\n433\n00:23:44.353 --> 00:23:48.751\nto get me back to, let's go ahead and\ninsert and type, and stay at normal, and\n\n434\n00:23:48.751 --> 00:23:51.435\ndon't remember all of\nthat local formatting.\n\n435\n00:23:51.435 --> 00:23:55.833\nThe things that Word will do,\nI keep saying Word, but Word,\n\n436\n00:23:55.833 --> 00:24:00.427\nOutlook, auto capitalize\nthe first words of your sentences.\n\n437\n00:24:00.427 --> 00:24:04.480\nI've gotten so used to it doing it for\nme, that I stopped doing it manually.\n\n438\n00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:12.160\nIf I type in, let's say if we can get\nthat little bit easier for us to see.\n\n439\n00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.360\nThen type in hte.\n\n440\n00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:13.920\nOkay.\n\n441\n00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.080\nNow this happen.\n\n442\n00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.731\nAs soon as I space after it,\nit did two things,\n\n443\n00:24:20.731 --> 00:24:25.577\nautomatically capitalized that\nfirst word of the sentence,\n\n444\n00:24:25.577 --> 00:24:29.418\nand hte is a commonly misspelled The,\nT-H-E.\n\n445\n00:24:29.418 --> 00:24:33.700\nIf you've seen that happen,\nit'll automatically switch things for you.\n\n446\n00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.280\nThat is all built into the program.\n\n447\n00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.850\nIf I, what do I have,\nlet's see if this one did it.\n\n448\n00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.331\nOkay.\nI was trying to type dog, D-O-G.\n\n449\n00:24:42.331 --> 00:24:44.410\nIt didn't change that, did it?\n\n450\n00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:51.900\nIt's not in Outlook's memory bank\nof those commonly misspelled words.\n\n451\n00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.650\nLet's go with, di- whoops,\nI was trying to do it automatically.\n\n452\n00:24:57.992 --> 00:24:59.429\nGoodness.\n\n453\n00:24:59.429 --> 00:25:03.676\n[LAUGH] I am trying to force\nmyself to not type it.\n\n454\n00:25:05.627 --> 00:25:07.540\nRight there.\n\n455\n00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.840\nI was trying to get to where if you\ntype in words that have contractions and\n\n456\n00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:15.130\nyou didn't use that apostrophe,\nit'll automatically change all of that.\n\n457\n00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:18.330\nAnd I could say, okay, sleep.\n\n458\n00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:20.180\nI was trying to say,\nthe dog didn't sleep in the bed.\n\n459\n00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:23.920\nSo I like these autoformats that happen.\n\n460\n00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.940\nI think it's great because I\nwant it to help me correct.\n\n461\n00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:32.950\nBut then the red squigglies,\nred squigglies indicate that I have, Ron.\n\n462\n00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:33.740\n&gt;&gt; A misspelling.\n\n463\n00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.110\n&gt;&gt; Misspelling.\n\n464\n00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.160\nThey don't have it in here, but\ndo you remember what the green ones are?\n\n465\n00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:38.800\n&gt;&gt; I don't.\n\n466\n00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.270\n&gt;&gt; The green ones are grammar mistakes.\n\n467\n00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:41.962\n&gt;&gt; Grammar.\n&gt;&gt; Yes if you have grammar,\n\n468\n00:25:41.962 --> 00:25:46.010\nsubject-verb agreement, those types\nof things, spaces after periods.\n\n469\n00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:48.640\nNow it's not bringing up any\nof the grammar mistakes.\n\n470\n00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.602\nIt's not bringing up any of the green,\n\n471\n00:25:50.602 --> 00:25:53.690\nbecause I'm pretty sure it doesn't\nautomatically check for it.\n\n472\n00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:58.960\nBut we can talk about how can we\nmake those corrections happen again.\n\n473\n00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.590\nBut sometimes if you have this\nauto-corrections in your email,\n\n474\n00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:05.685\nyou don't really want them to do that.\n\n475\n00:26:05.685 --> 00:26:08.580\nI need to zoom back out,\nmy mouse couldn't start working again.\n\n476\n00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:11.395\nCome on.\n\n477\n00:26:11.395 --> 00:26:15.861\nI think my computer is deciding\nto slow down a little bit.\n\n478\n00:26:19.157 --> 00:26:24.625\nAnd there we go, okay.\n\n479\n00:26:24.625 --> 00:26:27.640\n[LAUGH] That was a little\nbit of a freak-out.\n\n480\n00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:32.040\nSo all those corrections\nthat I had done in there,\n\n481\n00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:37.110\nI like them to have a,\nmaybe HTE is the name of our company, and\n\n482\n00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:42.410\nwe need to always have it do HTE,\nand stop auto-correcting.\n\n483\n00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:46.180\nMaybe I don't want it to auto-correct\nthe first letters of my sentences.\n\n484\n00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:51.640\nI didn't want it to, the D-I-D-N-T,\nmaybe that is an acronym for something.\n\n485\n00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:57.530\nSo all of these auto features can\nbe disabled at the local level,\n\n486\n00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:59.890\nwe'll call it, within this one document.\n\n487\n00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:01.920\nOr at the global level of,\n\n488\n00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.720\nthis program needs to stop\nidentifying these different things.\n\n489\n00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.190\nAt the local level,\nthere are things known as smart tags, and\n\n490\n00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:12.930\nI'm going to see if I can make\nthem enter so we can see this.\n\n491\n00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:14.170\nCome back up right here, and\n\n492\n00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:19.090\nyou see that little blue line\nthat comes under the word?\n\n493\n00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:22.670\nIt's remembering that it did something for\nyou.\n\n494\n00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:25.810\nThese little liney things,\nthey are called smart tags.\n\n495\n00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:29.590\nAnd they bring up a little tag\nthat is giving you options.\n\n496\n00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:32.810\nWe're going to see this again when\nwe start doing paste options and\n\n497\n00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:36.390\nfrom other places into our e-mail,\nor anything in Office,\n\n498\n00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:38.470\nyou're gonna see these\nsmart tags all over.\n\n499\n00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:43.220\nI used to think they were highly annoying,\nI quickly learned to love them\n\n500\n00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.610\nwith all of my heart,\nbecause it really, really helps me.\n\n501\n00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:50.120\nWhen you click on it, you can see that\nit's giving me some options of, do you\n\n502\n00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.570\nwant me to stop doing the corrections,\nyou want me to stop correcting the.\n\n503\n00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.699\nYou're not seeing it on my screen,\ncuz I'm zoomed in a little bit.\n\n504\n00:27:56.699 --> 00:28:00.530\nBut it has the control autocorrect options\nall together so that's where I was talking\n\n505\n00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:05.070\nabout local level, stop doing it for\nthis particular email, or\n\n506\n00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:09.623\ngo right into where I can start\nchanging everything program-wide and\n\n507\n00:28:09.623 --> 00:28:15.670\nthat h-t-e is not going to be\nrecognized ever again in my document.\n\n508\n00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:19.710\nSo these are all the different things\nthat Word will do automatically for you.\n\n509\n00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:23.880\nWe're gonna go ahead and jump into that\ncontrol autocorrect options because we\n\n510\n00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:29.660\nare down into all of the different\ntabs across the autocorrect in here.\n\n511\n00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.740\nThe capitalization, the,\nthe correct two capitalizations,\n\n512\n00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.390\nI do that all the time when I can\nremember to actually manually\n\n513\n00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:38.290\ncapitalize the first\nwords of my sentences.\n\n514\n00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:40.710\nThe replace as you type.\n\n515\n00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:45.500\nMaybe you do the copyright symbol all the\ntime, if you do that open parenthesis C,\n\n516\n00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.420\nclose parenthesis,\nit automatically changes it for you.\n\n517\n00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.390\nScroll on down through.\n\n518\n00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:51.820\nHere's the entire list of everything.\n\n519\n00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:57.810\nEvery single word that it sees typed in\nwrong, and then it replaces it with it.\n\n520\n00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:03.000\nSo you can either delete entries,\nyou can also add your own,\n\n521\n00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.350\nreplace with a correction.\n\n522\n00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.150\nAll of this is customizable.\n\n523\n00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:12.350\nThe autoformat as you type, where it\nautomatically creates a bulleted list,\n\n524\n00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:13.040\nthat's another thing.\n\n525\n00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.570\nIf you dash space and then start typing,\nit automatically makes a bullet.\n\n526\n00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:18.700\nMaybe you don't want it to do that.\n\n527\n00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:23.800\nThe auto format, that's again\nthe same built in the paragraphs.\n\n528\n00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.520\nAll of these things in here.\n\n529\n00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.370\nAuto format and auto format to\ntype is almost the same, but\n\n530\n00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:33.050\nyou can see as you type\nversus how it actually\n\n531\n00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:38.090\napplies the different ways of the hyphens\nwith the dash, dashes and en dashes.\n\n532\n00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:40.430\nThat's another big thing for\nme with typesetting.\n\n533\n00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.370\nEn dash.\nThink about the letter N, letter M?\n\n534\n00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:45.780\nEn is this big.\n\n535\n00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.020\nIs that big.\n\n536\n00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.206\nLook it up.\nE-N versus E-M.\n\n537\n00:29:49.206 --> 00:29:51.390\nTheir measurements.\n\n538\n00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.355\nI'll go off in a tangent\nif I don't stop right now.\n\n539\n00:29:53.355 --> 00:29:54.620\n[LAUGH] Click okay.\n\n540\n00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.410\nSo these are all different\nautocorrect options.\n\n541\n00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:00.270\nBut I did want to point out\nthat there are some options,\n\n542\n00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:03.140\ncuz we went back in,\nwe were in the program options.\n\n543\n00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:09.210\nRight now you have an open window,\nyour options from the backstage view of\n\n544\n00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:14.770\nyour composing versus the backstage\nview or the file tab of your Outlook.\n\n545\n00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:18.240\nThere will be some differences\ndepending on where you are at.\n\n546\n00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.090\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne,\nwe've just got a few minutes left.\n\n547\n00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:23.920\nCan you just show us where that option\nis and we'll see what we can do there.\n\n548\n00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.790\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you're keeping me on track,\nRonnie,\n\n549\n00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:28.920\nbecause I could talk about this for\nprobably days honestly.\n\n550\n00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.250\n[LAUGH] So, where if you wanted\nto make sure that my spelling and\n\n551\n00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:36.720\ngrammar is going to be checked at any\ntime that I'm ready to send my mail,\n\n552\n00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:41.360\nif I go under my file tab and\nI go in to options,\n\n553\n00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:45.450\nit's right here in the mail\nsection in the compose message.\n\n554\n00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:48.630\nAlways check spelling before sending.\n\n555\n00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:50.950\nAnd that's something you might want to\ngo ahead and do, and then of course,\n\n556\n00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:54.550\nyou can get back into these options,\nso options, options, options.\n\n557\n00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:55.300\nThis is available,\n\n558\n00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:59.810\ncuz I had said something about being in\na message body versus in your Outlook.\n\n559\n00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:04.500\nThis particular one is the same,\nso you can check it in either one.\n\n560\n00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:08.170\nBut always proof, always make\nsure

Thank you so much for having me back.\n\n9\n00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.205\nYes, I'm here for part 2.\n\n10\n00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:29.712\nI have so\n\n11\n00:00:29.712 --> 00:00:33.992\nmuch to talk about with formatting\ntechs that we had a extend this out.\n\n12\n00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:38.942\nAnd get into how we can insert more\ncontent into our messages that Outlook\n\n13\n00:00:38.942 --> 00:00:42.700\nwill allow us to do in\nour default HTML editing.\n\n14\n00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.843\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, when we start do something\nlike this, I'm starting to see some of\n\n15\n00:00:46.843 --> 00:00:50.949\nthe familiarities and we had talked about\nit before the show with Word a lot.\n\n16\n00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.112\nBut the idea here is that we can pretty\nmuch do a lot more formatting just even on\n\n17\n00:00:55.112 --> 00:00:56.650\nthe email messages.\n\n18\n00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.500\nSo now that we know that we\ncan do paragraph level and\n\n19\n00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.760\nalso the character level,\nwhat else can we do?\n\n20\n00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.510\n&gt;&gt; Now we're going to get into\nmore Microsoft specific content.\n\n21\n00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.054\nThis is the Office specific content\nthat we had mentioned in the previous\n\n22\n00:01:11.054 --> 00:01:15.460\nepisode about that I can be able to\ncreate it and make messages with it.\n\n23\n00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.022\nBut it might not always be completely\nappropriate when sending it to\n\n24\n00:01:20.022 --> 00:01:22.983\nrecipients that are outside\nof my network or\n\n25\n00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:27.155\nmy Exchange Server that are going\nto Gmail, Yahoo accounts.\n\n26\n00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:32.530\nYou might want to decide when you want to\nuse this or if you ever want to use it.\n\n27\n00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.080\nBut it is part of Outlook and Office\nin general, so we are going to do that.\n\n28\n00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.910\nLike Ronnie said,\nif you are familiar with Word,\n\n29\n00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.740\nit's gonna do everything that Word can do,\nso it's available for you.\n\n30\n00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.390\nSo if more in depth, go back and\nwatch our Word shows.\n\n31\n00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.730\nAnd of course, check out part one of-\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Outlook in Office.\n\n16\n00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:52.855\n&gt;&gt; I know-\n&gt;&gt; Which is an Office product, right?\n\n17\n00:00:52.855 --> 00:00:55.115\n&gt;&gt; We've been mix-and-matching\nthose words the whole time.\n\n18\n00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:58.131\nAnd so, yeah, we're just gonna\nkeep on keeping on with that one.\n\n19\n00:00:58.131 --> 00:00:58.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n20\n00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.515\njust bear with us, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n21\n00:00:59.515 --> 00:01:00.035\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n22\n00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:02.664\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When you have two products that start\n\n23\n00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:06.490\nwith an O, and end in 2016,\nyou're gonna flip-flop them.\n\n24\n00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.163\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; It does happen, so.\n\n25\n00:01:08.163 --> 00:01:10.634\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so well,\nwe'll try to say that we're in Outlook.\n\n26\n00:01:10.634 --> 00:01:11.387\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n27\n00:01:11.387 --> 00:01:15.258\n&gt;&gt; And we'll be going to our Outlook\noptions, so there's another O.\n\n28\n00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:16.875\n&gt;&gt; There's another O.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n29\n00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:19.178\n&gt;&gt; Let's jump down into my computer,\n\n30\n00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:21.565\nand get into Joey's email account.\n\n31\n00:01:21.565 --> 00:01:26.706\nAnd we're going to start composing\nmessages with these email options.\n\n32\n00:01:26.706 --> 00:01:33.149\nSo we've gone through our basic emails\nwith, what's our To field, our CC field.\n\n33\n00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.363\nWe even covered our BCC field,\naddressing to multiple people.\n\n34\n00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:38.687\nSo, we're going to take that and\njust expand.\n\n35\n00:01:38.687 --> 00:01:43.354\nSo we're going to start\nin a New Message from our\n\n36\n00:01:43.354 --> 00:01:47.683\nHome tab of our ribbon\nin our Email section.\n\n37\n00:01:47.683 --> 00:01:51.967\nAnd let's start over on our, well, why\ndon't I start here on this Message tab?\n\n38\n00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:57.010\nCuz some of the things that we are going\nto be covering are on this particular tab.\n\n39\n00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.150\nThere's only a couple of them,\nand they're over here.\n\n40\n00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.859\nThey're the Importance level, the High\nImportance and the Low Importance.\n\n41\n00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:07.232\nSo I just wanted to point that\nout that they are on this tab.\n\n42\n00:02:07.232 --> 00:02:10.876\nBut I'd like to go ahead and\nexplain what exactly that means,\n\n43\n00:02:10.876 --> 00:02:13.540\nwhen we get over in to our Other section.\n\n44\n00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.046\nWe are going to get in to our Options tab,\nof our New Message window.\n\n45\n00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:22.607\nAnd so, we have our different fields\nhere that we've covered, the BCC field,\n\n46\n00:02:22.607 --> 00:02:24.457\nwhich is our blind carbon copy.\n\n47\n00:02:24.457 --> 00:02:26.905\nTo where we can put people in there,\n\n48\n00:02:26.905 --> 00:02:31.159\nthat it makes it look like a CC\naddress to them, but only them.\n\n49\n00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.351\nBut if there's multiple\npeople in that BCC field,\n\n50\n00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:37.180\nthen there's multiple messages going out.\n\n51\n00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.035\nAnd, of course, in there is\nanything in the To or CC field,\n\n52\n00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:41.490\nthat gets shown up as well.\n\n53\n00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.180\nBut that was covered in another episode.\n\n54\n00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.110\nBut at least here,\nyou could go ahead and add that field\n\n55\n00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.640\ninto our Message window, if you wanted\nto go ahead and do it from there.\n\n56\n00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.560\nThere's also the From field,\nI'm not sure if we covered this yet.\n\n57\n00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.500\nAnd right now you're like,\n\n58\n00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.170\nwell, why would I ever need to have it\nbe from somebody else other than me?\n\n59\n00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.310\nWell that's because Joey, right now,\nis only managing his email,\n\n60\n00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.220\njust one email account within Outlook.\n\n61\n00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.057\nBut you can configure Outlook\nto manage multiple accounts.\n\n62\n00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:15.086\nI could have, I might have access to,\nsay, my boss's email.\n\n63\n00:03:15.086 --> 00:03:18.134\nAnd I can go ahead and\ncontrol his inbox, and\n\n64\n00:03:18.134 --> 00:03:21.140\nbe able to send email on behalf of him.\n\n65\n00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.302\nSo I need to determine, well,\nwho is this email coming from, and\n\n66\n00:03:24.302 --> 00:03:25.924\nthen I could switch the account.\n\n67\n00:03:25.924 --> 00:03:29.502\nSo if I click on that From field, you can\nsee, well, it gives you that field, and\n\n68\n00:03:29.502 --> 00:03:31.044\nthe little drop-down over here.\n\n69\n00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:35.580\nThis is where, if you did have multiple\naccounts, you could then choose,\n\n70\n00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.430\nwhich one is this going to\nlook like it's coming from?\n\n71\n00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.482\nSo I know in the University,\nI manage multiple accounts,\n\n72\n00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:45.742\nand so I would always have to make\nsure that that was always on.\n\n73\n00:03:45.742 --> 00:03:49.525\nAnd I'd have to think,\nevery time I send emails, who am I today?\n\n74\n00:03:49.525 --> 00:03:50.837\nKind of like how I am\nin all these episodes.\n\n75\n00:03:50.837 --> 00:03:54.318\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Am I Joey, am I Lance, am I JT?\n\n76\n00:03:54.318 --> 00:03:55.998\n&gt;&gt; Poor Vonne has no idea\nwho she is sometimes.\n\n77\n00:03:55.998 --> 00:03:57.746\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know,\n\n78\n00:03:57.746 --> 00:04:01.709\nit's kind of hard keeping\nthese all in check and track.\n\n79\n00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.653\n&gt;&gt; She's like, what, email who?\n\n80\n00:04:03.653 --> 00:04:06.914\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I have to watch myself, and\n\n81\n00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:08.262\nI have to remind you.\n\n82\n00:04:08.262 --> 00:04:12.090\nWhat account are we in today,\nwho are we saying that we are?\n\n83\n00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.649\nAnd so, don't worry, we're going to get\ninto Chris and JC a little later, too.\n\n84\n00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:19.234\nBut for right now, we are Joey, and this\nis where this email's coming from, and\n\n85\n00:04:19.234 --> 00:04:20.834\nit's the only account that I have.\n\n86\n00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:25.859\nSo the From field isn't necessarily\napplicable, in this instance.\n\n87\n00:04:25.859 --> 00:04:28.663\nLet's get in over to these other options.\n\n88\n00:04:28.663 --> 00:04:32.374\nBecause a lot of the things that we're\ngoing to be covering here are going to be\n\n89\n00:04:32.374 --> 00:04:33.960\nright here on this ribbon.\n\n90\n00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.040\nThe Voting, which we'll get into,\nthe Delivery and\n\n91\n00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.650\nRead Receipts, and the Delay options.\n\n92\n00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.530\nNow I did mention the Importance, but\n\n93\n00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.378\nthe Importance buttons aren't on\nthis Options tab, but they are here.\n\n94\n00:04:46.378 --> 00:04:50.095\nWe're going to go to what\nI call the More button,\n\n95\n00:04:50.095 --> 00:04:54.415\nI think the technical name is\nthe Dialog Box Launcher button.\n\n96\n00:04:55.585 --> 00:04:57.695\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't really roll off the tongue,\ndoes it?\n\n97\n00:04:57.695 --> 00:05:00.412\n&gt;&gt; No, no, and\nit doesn't really describe what it does,\n\n98\n00:05:00.412 --> 00:05:05.022\nwhich is gives you more options, so-\n&gt;&gt; Well I love how they call it the dialog\n\n99\n00:05:05.022 --> 00:05:07.802\nbox, and you're thinking,\nwhat the heck is a dialog box?\n\n100\n00:05:07.802 --> 00:05:11.442\nAnd typically that's anytime you click\non something, and a window opens up.\n\n101\n00:05:11.442 --> 00:05:14.222\nSomething jumps up and\ngives you options, Windows,\n\n102\n00:05:14.222 --> 00:05:16.372\nor Microsoft likes to\ncall it a dialog box.\n\n103\n00:05:16.372 --> 00:05:17.911\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes,\nI mean it could be like the prompt.\n\n104\n00:05:17.911 --> 00:05:21.120\nEven like the Save,\nif you wanna save or not save?\n\n105\n00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.935\nWell, you can call it a prompt,\nyou can call it the Save window.\n\n106\n00:05:23.935 --> 00:05:26.955\nI mean, we tend to kinda label\nthings the way we wanna label.\n\n107\n00:05:26.955 --> 00:05:28.667\n&gt;&gt; The way we think we would label them,\nright, yeah.\n\n108\n00:05:28.667 --> 00:05:32.036\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and kinda like how I make\nup all my own terminology anyways.\n\n109\n00:05:32.036 --> 00:05:33.581\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's the More button.\n\n110\n00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:35.667\n&gt;&gt; The thingamajig on the doohickey,\nthat's what we're talking about.\n\n111\n00:05:35.667 --> 00:05:36.557\n&gt;&gt; Do you know how many\ntimes I've used that?\n\n112\n00:05:36.557 --> 00:05:39.259\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne, those are technical terms.\n\n113\n00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:42.019\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They are, they are, so.\n\n114\n00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:45.334\nAll right, so\nwe are going to click on this More Button.\n\n115\n00:05:45.334 --> 00:05:49.814\nBecause to me, this is where it\ntakes you into all of these advanced\n\n116\n00:05:49.814 --> 00:05:52.565\nfeatures of sending our email message.\n\n117\n00:05:52.565 --> 00:05:54.850\nThey're all right in this dialog box.\n\n118\n00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:01.460\nAnd so you can see that Importance, and\nthose were the buttons on the Home tab.\n\n119\n00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.630\nSo what does this mean?\n\n120\n00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.330\nIf I'm sending a message, and\nI didn't set anything, it's just normal.\n\n121\n00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.390\nIt's, okay, we don't see any type\nof indication, as a receiver,\n\n122\n00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.912\nthat this is some type\nof a priority level.\n\n123\n00:06:13.912 --> 00:06:18.434\nSo I could set this as a High Priority or\na Low Priority.\n\n124\n00:06:18.434 --> 00:06:20.682\nOr Importance, I mean,\nI guess they labeled it Importance, so\n\n125\n00:06:20.682 --> 00:06:21.986\nI should use the right word there.\n\n126\n00:06:21.986 --> 00:06:25.627\nSo if I've labelled this as High,\nall this gonna do is,\n\n127\n00:06:25.627 --> 00:06:29.667\nit's just going to give a little\nindication to the receiver.\n\n128\n00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:33.905\nThey're gonna see a little exclamation\npoint as an icon, in their email.\n\n129\n00:06:33.905 --> 00:06:37.325\nWhether they're in\nthe Compact View that we're in, or\n\n130\n00:06:37.325 --> 00:06:40.395\nin the Preview View which\nwe'll be getting into.\n\n131\n00:06:40.395 --> 00:06:43.929\nAgain, when we get into our Organize and\nSearch and Customize episodes,\n\n132\n00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:46.608\nyou'll be seeing where this\nis going to come into play.\n\n133\n00:06:46.608 --> 00:06:51.332\nBut it's really just for you to try to\ntell that person, hey, this is important,\n\n134\n00:06:51.332 --> 00:06:53.260\nit's like speaking in all caps.\n\n135\n00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.290\n&gt;&gt; You need to look at this,\npay attention to me.\n\n136\n00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:01.000\nAnd like you said, there is a little red\nicon exclamation point, or is it a flag?\n\n137\n00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.150\nIt's a red exclamation point.\n\n138\n00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay, red exclamation point.\n\n139\n00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.530\n&gt;&gt; There are red flags.\n\n140\n00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:04.670\n&gt;&gt; There are red flags, that's right.\n\n141\n00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:05.403\n&gt;&gt; Something a little different.\n\n142\n00:07:05.403 --> 00:07:10.098\nYes, so it's just trying for you to, and\nall of this stuff is for you to try.\n\n143\n00:07:10.098 --> 00:07:15.451\nTo tell the sender what you\nare wanting this email to either do,\n\n144\n00:07:15.451 --> 00:07:17.625\nor to be treated as.\n\n145\n00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:22.285\nNow how the receiver goes ahead and\nacknowledges your Importance,\n\n146\n00:07:22.285 --> 00:07:23.601\nis another story.\n\n147\n00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:25.154\nAnd I, it's funny,\n\n148\n00:07:25.154 --> 00:07:30.315\ncuz I've had some people where\nevery single email is important.\n\n149\n00:07:30.315 --> 00:07:31.410\n&gt;&gt; That's the narcissist flag.\n\n150\n00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.455\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what we call that,\n\n151\n00:07:32.455 --> 00:07:35.050\nlet's check that,\nI'm important, look at me.\n\n152\n00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.203\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's like,\n\n153\n00:07:36.203 --> 00:07:37.510\nthere's cookies in the break room.\n\n154\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.410\nWell, I would think that's\nan important thing.\n\n155\n00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is important,\nwe all know about that.\n\n156\n00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.810\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but if you're treating\neverything as important,\n\n157\n00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.630\nthen it kinda loses its meaning.\n\n158\n00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.770\nIt's like the girl who cried wolf, right?\n\n159\n00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:49.460\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n160\n00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.830\n&gt;&gt; It's like, well now, I can't gauge-\n&gt;&gt; You're hammering it too hard.\n\n161\n00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.234\nAnd people gonna think, well,\nyou say everything's important,\n\n162\n00:07:57.234 --> 00:07:59.453\nthat it rained three drops or\nan inch today.\n\n163\n00:07:59.453 --> 00:08:01.428\nWell, that's nice but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n164\n00:08:01.428 --> 00:08:05.055\n&gt;&gt; Probably not business-sensitive kind of\n\n165\n00:08:05.055 --> 00:08:09.694\nstuff So\nplease put importance responsibly, right?\n\n166\n00:08:09.694 --> 00:08:11.836\n&gt;&gt; Yes. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Use response actually,\n\n167\n00:08:11.836 --> 00:08:12.876\nall of these features.\n\n168\n00:08:12.876 --> 00:08:13.457\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n169\n00:08:13.457 --> 00:08:15.020\n&gt;&gt; I would say use-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n170\n00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.057\n&gt;&gt; Responsibly.\n\n171\n00:08:16.057 --> 00:08:18.340\nAnd I guess along those same lines,\nwe have the sensitivity.\n\n172\n00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:24.044\nThe sensitivity right here is where we\nhave personal, private and confidential.\n\n173\n00:08:24.044 --> 00:08:28.164\nNow, it's not gonna do anything special to\nyour email, except add a little line, and\n\n174\n00:08:28.164 --> 00:08:30.000\nit's actually kind of small.\n\n175\n00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.970\nSo if somebody's not paying attention,\nthey might not ever see this.\n\n176\n00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.420\nBut it is something that if\nyou start to establish, and\n\n177\n00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.723\nthis is one of those you\nhave to know your workflow.\n\n178\n00:08:38.723 --> 00:08:41.823\nAnd you have to know your people,\nif you wanna say.\n\n179\n00:08:41.823 --> 00:08:46.234\nAnd almost make it like an established\nprecedent or rule like hey,\n\n180\n00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:51.533\nif I mark something as confidential in\nmy email by this setting that I'm using.\n\n181\n00:08:51.533 --> 00:08:56.140\nMake sure you don't go ahead and\ntell everybody in the office.\n\n182\n00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.930\nI really want this to be confidential, and\n\n183\n00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.620\nsometimes you have to really\njust tell people that.\n\n184\n00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.640\nI'm going to use this, and\nthis is what it's going to mean.\n\n185\n00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.233\nSo let's try to go ahead and we agree\nthat this is how we're gonna talk to each\n\n186\n00:09:08.233 --> 00:09:10.044\nother, so let's go ahead and use it.\n\n187\n00:09:10.044 --> 00:09:11.050\nNow-\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n188\n00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.838\nthat's something you can also\nput in your employee handbook.\n\n189\n00:09:12.838 --> 00:09:17.488\nA lot of people put employee rules and\nhandbooks on intranet sites.\n\n190\n00:09:17.488 --> 00:09:21.017\nSo you just have to browse to it, and\nthere's all the information you need.\n\n191\n00:09:21.017 --> 00:09:24.599\nAnd this is probably one of those areas\nwhere you want to take some time and\n\n192\n00:09:24.599 --> 00:09:28.355\neffort to really define what you mean\nwhen you send a confidential email, or\n\n193\n00:09:28.355 --> 00:09:30.670\na private email or something like that.\n\n194\n00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.844\nSo that your employees are fully aware of\nwhat each one of those things are supposed\n\n195\n00:09:33.844 --> 00:09:34.447\nto be used for.\n\n196\n00:09:34.447 --> 00:09:37.637\n&gt;&gt; And if it's truly confidential,\ndon't send it in an email.\n\n197\n00:09:37.637 --> 00:09:39.995\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] that's the rule, right?\n\n198\n00:09:39.995 --> 00:09:43.880\n&gt;&gt; I mean if we're really getting down\nto it, because anything you have in\n\n199\n00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.574\nyour email, it is a trail just like-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n200\n00:09:46.574 --> 00:09:50.696\n&gt;&gt; It's right there in black and\nwhite, so just be careful.\n\n201\n00:09:50.696 --> 00:09:52.804\nThat's a totally different subject,\nbut yes.\n\n202\n00:09:52.804 --> 00:09:53.508\n&gt;&gt; Which we're gonna kind of get to,\nright?\n\n203\n00:09:53.508 --> 00:09:55.838\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we will.\n\n204\n00:09:55.838 --> 00:09:56.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n205\n00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.441\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So you can go ahead and\n\n206\n00:09:58.441 --> 00:10:00.995\nmark the sensitivity as personal,\nprivate or confidential.\n\n207\n00:10:00.995 --> 00:10:02.494\nI'll go with personal for right now.\n\n208\n00:10:02.494 --> 00:10:06.738\nOkay, so we are getting into\nover here the Security settings.\n\n209\n00:10:06.738 --> 00:10:11.230\nNow this is one of those where we're\nkind of gonna gloss over surfaces.\n\n210\n00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:15.059\nJustin always says that this\nis gonna be hand wave section.\n\n211\n00:10:15.059 --> 00:10:15.841\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n212\n00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:18.285\n&gt;&gt; Like we're just going to gloss over and\nwe're all good.\n\n213\n00:10:18.285 --> 00:10:21.508\n[LAUGH] But\nI want to at least where these options and\n\n214\n00:10:21.508 --> 00:10:24.666\nsettings are in your\nmessage that your sending.\n\n215\n00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:27.587\nYou could encrypt the message contents and\n\n216\n00:10:27.587 --> 00:10:32.865\nthat's where anything that along the ways\nof where it's being sent from your\n\n217\n00:10:32.865 --> 00:10:37.914\ncomputer through the matrix as I call it,\nand then received to somebody.\n\n218\n00:10:37.914 --> 00:10:41.370\nYou could encrypt all the contents and\nattachments in there.\n\n219\n00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.930\nYou could also add a digital\nsignature to this message.\n\n220\n00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.005\nDigital signatures are not\nthe same as email signature,\n\n221\n00:10:49.005 --> 00:10:53.117\nsomething that you can add that goes in\nto the message by it says Vonne Smith.\n\n222\n00:10:53.117 --> 00:10:56.095\nAnd has my address and my contact,\nmy phone number and everything,\n\n223\n00:10:56.095 --> 00:10:58.190\nthat's completely different.\n\n224\n00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:05.120\nDigital signatures are a way that you\ncan use to basically verify who you are.\n\n225\n00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.649\nAnd then verify that whatever is\nbeing sent, whether it's an email,\n\n226\n00:11:09.649 --> 00:11:11.951\nWord document, Excel file, PDF,\n\n227\n00:11:11.951 --> 00:11:16.741\nthat when it gets to the receiver that\nthat receiver knows it's from you.\n\n228\n00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:24.000\nLike really you, and that it hasn't been\ntampered with anybody else along the way.\n\n229\n00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.980\nAnd it works with what are known as keys.\n\n230\n00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.558\nAnd like I have a key and\nit's known as also a certificate.\n\n231\n00:11:30.558 --> 00:11:32.619\nSo you're gonna hear words\nlike certificate and keys.\n\n232\n00:11:32.619 --> 00:11:36.409\nI have a certificate almost like\na birth certificate, like this is me,\n\n233\n00:11:36.409 --> 00:11:37.760\nthis validates me.\n\n234\n00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.670\nIt been issued by an certificate\nauthoring company,\n\n235\n00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.092\nservice, we'll call it-\n&gt;&gt; Infrastructure.\n\n236\n00:11:44.092 --> 00:11:45.372\n&gt;&gt; Infrastructure, okay, thank you.\n\n237\n00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:46.202\n&gt;&gt; PKI.\n\n238\n00:11:46.202 --> 00:11:48.577\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] I have an expert here-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n239\n00:11:48.577 --> 00:11:49.268\n&gt;&gt; In digital signature so\n\n240\n00:11:49.268 --> 00:11:50.446\nI'm glad that you're hosting with me.\n\n241\n00:11:50.446 --> 00:11:53.694\nBecause basically I have my key,\nI sent it to you.\n\n242\n00:11:53.694 --> 00:11:56.895\nYou would have my certificate\nto facely verify-\n\n243\n00:11:56.895 --> 00:11:57.689\n&gt;&gt; You've got two keys.\n\n244\n00:11:57.689 --> 00:11:58.472\n&gt;&gt; Two keys, okay.\n\n245\n00:11:58.472 --> 00:11:59.661\n&gt;&gt; Everybody has two keys, right?\n\n246\n00:11:59.661 --> 00:12:03.461\nThis is how it works,\nVonne gets a public key and a private key,\n\n247\n00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:06.030\nI get a public key and a private key.\n\n248\n00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.883\nSo if I want something to go to\nVonne that only she can see,\n\n249\n00:12:08.883 --> 00:12:12.221\nI take her public key which is public,\nit's for everyone to have.\n\n250\n00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:15.990\nAnd I encrypt that message and\nI send it to Vonne.\n\n251\n00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.110\nOnly she can decrypt it,\nbecause that's what her private key does.\n\n252\n00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:22.170\nSame in reverse,\nI can use my signature and\n\n253\n00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.250\ncreate a hashed value\nusing a hashing algorithm.\n\n254\n00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:28.506\nBasically just math against whatever\nyou type in, could be your name,\n\n255\n00:12:28.506 --> 00:12:29.549\nwhatever the case is.\n\n256\n00:12:29.549 --> 00:12:33.120\nMaybe it's my public key that she can see,\nright?\n\n257\n00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.980\nI hash that up and\nthen I get a little value.\n\n258\n00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.748\nI put that inside of the thing\nthat only she can encrypt.\n\n259\n00:12:38.748 --> 00:12:43.226\nShe decrypts it, she checks that\nvalue against my digital signature or\n\n260\n00:12:43.226 --> 00:12:47.565\nnot my signature, my public key,\nand sees if anything has changed.\n\n261\n00:12:47.565 --> 00:12:52.100\nIf anything has changed then she knows,\nmaybe that's not a good idea, right?\n\n262\n00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.436\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So it's all about verifying integrity.\n\n263\n00:12:54.436 --> 00:12:56.397\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and like you were saying-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n264\n00:12:56.397 --> 00:12:59.177\n&gt;&gt; It's we agree, and\nwe have our special decoder rings-\n\n265\n00:12:59.177 --> 00:13:00.009\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n266\n00:13:00.009 --> 00:13:03.666\n&gt;&gt; To decode each other's messages,\nbecause we've established\n\n267\n00:13:03.666 --> 00:13:07.809\nthat relationship as I have your key,\nyou have my key, or certificate.\n\n268\n00:13:07.809 --> 00:13:11.240\nIt's all that secret handshake,\nand we all know.\n\n269\n00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.190\nWe know it's you, we're good to go.\n\n270\n00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:14.958\nAnd so\nthis is where you could go ahead and\n\n271\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.943\nadd your digital signature\nto this message.\n\n272\n00:13:16.943 --> 00:13:20.933\nAnd this is something that if\nyou're using digital signatures in\n\n273\n00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:25.080\nyour Workflow in your company,\nthey're gonna set this up for you.\n\n274\n00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.010\nAnd they're going to have okay,\nhere's your certificate,\n\n275\n00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.030\nthis is where you find it.\n\n276\n00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.077\nAnd there's certificate servers-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n277\n00:13:30.077 --> 00:13:32.524\n&gt;&gt; And there's whole spaces-\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot of upkeep.\n\n278\n00:13:32.524 --> 00:13:33.275\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n279\n00:13:33.275 --> 00:13:37.650\n&gt;&gt; And I said that you would hash\nthe public key, that was wrong.\n\n280\n00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.790\nIt's the data inside of your email.\n\n281\n00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:43.653\nEverything inside of that email gets\nhashed and then encrypted, right?\n\n282\n00:13:43.653 --> 00:13:45.323\n&gt;&gt; And then the key.\n&gt;&gt; Right, well you encrypt with the key.\n\n283\n00:13:45.323 --> 00:13:46.690\n&gt;&gt; With the key, okay.\n\n284\n00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.142\n&gt;&gt; With the key, so there you go.\n\n285\n00:13:48.142 --> 00:13:50.039\nThat should give you,\nI know it sounds like a lot of wow.\n\n286\n00:13:50.039 --> 00:13:52.357\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're blowing my mind here,\n\n287\n00:13:52.357 --> 00:13:53.524\nwith this crazy key business.\n\n288\n00:13:53.524 --> 00:13:58.404\nIt is definitely deep security, just know\nthat you are able to verify integrity by\n\n289\n00:13:58.404 --> 00:14:00.540\nturning on these types of options.\n\n290\n00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.482\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and those words that we use,\nlike certificate-\n\n291\n00:14:02.482 --> 00:14:03.106\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n292\n00:14:03.106 --> 00:14:04.143\n&gt;&gt; And keys.\n\n293\n00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:07.135\nIf I went into the security properties\nright here within this dialog box.\n\n294\n00:14:07.135 --> 00:14:11.331\nAnd I choose Change Settings, you can\nsee there is a sign in certificate,\n\n295\n00:14:11.331 --> 00:14:13.090\nencryption certificate.\n\n296\n00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.281\nSo all those things that\nwe're talking about,\n\n297\n00:14:15.281 --> 00:14:17.853\nthese are things that you\nwould have to navigate out to,\n\n298\n00:14:17.853 --> 00:14:20.137\nmaybe often to your server that is-\n&gt;&gt;

And\n\n344\n00:15:55.782 --> 00:15:58.169\nthat's the same thing,\nthese are all requests.\n\n345\n00:15:58.169 --> 00:16:00.501\nAnd these are things that you can set up,\nbut\n\n346\n00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:03.286\nI don't set up that I have\nthe reads on my cell phone.\n\n347\n00:16:03.286 --> 00:16:05.452\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I don't want people to see that.\n\n348\n00:16:05.452 --> 00:16:06.304\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n349\n00:16:06.304 --> 00:16:07.359\n&gt;&gt; So I turn that off.\n\n350\n00:16:07.359 --> 00:16:08.686\nWell the same thing here.\n\n351\n00:16:08.686 --> 00:16:13.726\nIs that, if I request a delivery receipt,\nI'm requesting from my\n\n352\n00:16:13.726 --> 00:16:18.670\nserver that I want that message to say,\nhey, did I get that out?\n\n353\n00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:23.187\nIt's like the snail mail, where we have to\nsend like a certified message, that I know\n\n354\n00:16:23.187 --> 00:16:27.675\nthat the, I think it was when I was paying\nmy parking tickets or something like that.\n\n355\n00:16:27.675 --> 00:16:28.726\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Von.\n\n356\n00:16:28.726 --> 00:16:31.651\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know,\nit was a while ago, I was young,\n\n357\n00:16:31.651 --> 00:16:33.907\n[LAUGH] So I know that that got there.\n\n358\n00:16:33.907 --> 00:16:38.360\nAnd so all these things we've seen\nprobably throughout our different\n\n359\n00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:43.266\nplaces in life, whether we're using\nsnail mail or using our text messages,\n\n360\n00:16:43.266 --> 00:16:46.834\nof being delivered and\nthen getting that read receipt.\n\n361\n00:16:46.834 --> 00:16:52.549\nNow you could go ahead and check a read\nreceipt off the person that's getting it,\n\n362\n00:16:52.549 --> 00:16:55.770\nthey can choose to not\nsend that back to you.\n\n363\n00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.047\nSo, they can be like, well I read it but\nI'm not gonna let you know, or\n\n364\n00:16:59.047 --> 00:17:01.660\nthey can say, yes and\nthey can go ahead and let you know,\n\n365\n00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.067\nbut that doesn't mean they actually\ncomprehended the actual message.\n\n366\n00:17:05.067 --> 00:17:09.734\nSo these again, all are requests and\nways that you can help hopefully verify,\n\n367\n00:17:09.734 --> 00:17:12.563\nbut that's something\nagain in your workflow,\n\n368\n00:17:12.563 --> 00:17:16.540\nif your boss is sending a read receipt,\nyou might wanna send that.\n\n369\n00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:21.620\n&gt;&gt; And that's really the context in which\nyou see this, it's more of a courtesy\n\n370\n00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:25.370\nif it's just between friends but if it's\nin a business, someone sends you a read\n\n371\n00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:30.000\nreceipt that is meant to be answered and\nsay, yes, I have read this.\n\n372\n00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.010\nI may enable that feature,\nI have a delivery receipt, yes it has\n\n373\n00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.450\nbeen delivered, they know because they\nneed to keep that workflow going and\n\n374\n00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.650\nwe don't need any break, and we don't\nneed people to go, I didn't see that.\n\n375\n00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.780\nBecause people try that, and\nthey go, no, we know you saw it,\n\n376\n00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.910\nso we have to keep an eye on what\nthings are happening in a business.\n\n377\n00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:51.010\n&gt;&gt; Think of this as coming from HR and\nthere's some new policy on the parking for\n\n378\n00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:54.850\nthat particular afternoon, and\nthat way you come back, my car was towed.\n\n379\n00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:58.040\nWell, we sent out the message and\nyou said that you read this and so\n\n380\n00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:02.227\nit's a football game tonight and you will\nbe towed, I'm remembering those things.\n\n381\n00:18:02.227 --> 00:18:05.177\n&gt;&gt; You worked at a university\nwith a large football team.\n\n382\n00:18:05.177 --> 00:18:10.767\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it was a huge deal, so these are\nall the things and the delivery receipts,\n\n383\n00:18:10.767 --> 00:18:16.193\nthis is where if you're with an exchange\nserver and everything, that'll go\n\n384\n00:18:16.193 --> 00:18:21.464\nahead and be honored but not all mail\nservers honor the delivery receipts.\n\n385\n00:18:21.464 --> 00:18:24.844\nSo maybe you're emailing somebody\nthat has a Yahoo account or\n\n386\n00:18:24.844 --> 00:18:29.199\nsome other type of server, they've set\nup their own internal Domino servers or\n\n387\n00:18:29.199 --> 00:18:30.900\nwhatever, all that stuff.\n\n388\n00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.378\n&gt;&gt; Don't even get started.\n\n389\n00:18:32.378 --> 00:18:34.850\n&gt;&gt; I know [LAUGH], old school stuff, but\n\n390\n00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:40.450\nif they don't always say, like,\nyeah, it's been delivered, so, again,\n\n391\n00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:45.740\nit's a request that you can go ahead and\nchoose if you would like to.\n\n392\n00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.480\nLet's come around to a couple other\nthings in this delivery options,\n\n393\n00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.680\nwe haven't gone over voting buttons,\nI'll come back around to that,\n\n394\n00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.570\nhave replies sent to,\n[LAUGH] this one's fun.\n\n395\n00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:03.879\nThat let's say I'm the boss and I'm like,\nhey, we're gonna plan a party for\n\n396\n00:19:03.879 --> 00:19:09.601\nJC, it's a surprise party, go ahead and\nwhen you reply it's gonna go sent to Joey.\n\n397\n00:19:09.601 --> 00:19:12.550\nSo it's like I'm sending out, or\nwait I'm Joey right now sorry.\n\n398\n00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:13.998\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you!\n\n515\n00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:52.900\nSo you can see that it's\ntalking about how delivery and\n\n516\n00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:57.230\nread receipts are going to be\nrequested and sent to you.\n\n517\n00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:59.870\nSo you can see that for\nany message received\n\n518\n00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:03.710\ndo you want me to ask every time or right\nthere, see, never send a read receipt.\n\n519\n00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:07.329\nSo remember, I said people,\nthey don't have to respond to you.\n\n520\n00:26:07.329 --> 00:26:11.229\nSo somebody could have this set up\nthat they'll never get a read receipt\n\n521\n00:26:11.229 --> 00:26:12.663\nsent back to that person.\n\n522\n00:26:12.663 --> 00:26:17.439\nSo just kinda check some of these\noptions of what you might want to\n\n523\n00:26:17.439 --> 00:26:19.960\nhave your inbox set up with.\n\n524\n00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:24.200\nSo you could go ahead and make sure this\nis how people are tracking my response,\n\n525\n00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.450\nespecially with those receipts, and\n\n526\n00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:31.320\nthen the other section I wanted to show\nyou was in the send message category.\n\n527\n00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.770\nThe default importance level.\n\n528\n00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:35.601\nRemember how I said that\nsomebody went ahead and\n\n529\n00:26:35.601 --> 00:26:37.308\nset all their emails were high importance.\n\n530\n00:26:37.308 --> 00:26:38.111\nYeah, they probably set it up right here.\n\n531\n00:26:38.111 --> 00:26:39.733\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n532\n00:26:39.733 --> 00:26:41.582\n&gt;&gt; So, I'd probably keep that\n\n533\n00:26:41.582 --> 00:26:44.740\nas normal and\nthe sensitivity as normal as well,\n\n534\n00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:49.610\nand those were the two that I really\nwanted to kind of go ahead and point out.\n\n535\n00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:52.930\nThere's something about mark\nall of your messages by default\n\n536\n00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.490\nexpired after this many days.\n\n537\n00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:59.050\nI'm not sure if I would want\nto do such a global setting.\n\n538\n00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:03.390\n&gt;&gt; This is probably for, you know we have\nan account that's specifically set up\n\n539\n00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:07.680\nto inform our user base for something, and\n\n540\n00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.250\nyou can set these options for that\nmailbox, and everybody knows, everything\n\n541\n00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:16.700\nthat comes from this user is important,\nand will expire after x amount of days.\n\n542\n00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.350\nThat's what I would think\nthey would use that for.\n\n543\n00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:19.390\n&gt;&gt; That's a good scenario.\n\n544\n00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:20.001\nI didn't even think about that.\n\n545\n00:27:20.001 --> 00:27:20.798\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just like,\n\n546\n00:27:20.798 --> 00:27:24.111\nI'm not sure if I'd ever use that, but-\n&gt;&gt; I worked in a large office for\n\n547\n00:27:24.111 --> 00:27:25.533\nquite some time.\n\n548\n00:27:25.533 --> 00:27:28.747\n&gt;&gt; And see, that's an, to each its own,\nand everybody had a different reasons for\n\n549\n00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:29.989\nwhy you wanna set all those up.\n\n550\n00:27:29.989 --> 00:27:35.744\nBut those are in the options\nof your Outlook within Office.\n\n551\n00:27:35.744 --> 00:27:36.533\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n552\n00:27:36.533 --> 00:27:40.738\n[LAUGH] I think that covers everything\nthat I wanted to do about composing our\n\n553\n00:27:40.738 --> 00:27:42.673\nmessages with these options, and\n\n554\n00:27:42.673 --> 00:27:47.170\nthen we'll be back in just a little bit\nwith a receiving of all of these options.\n\n555\n00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:49.080\n&gt;&gt; All right, part two sounds\nlike it's gonna be a lot of fun,\n\n556\n00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.380\ndefinitely join us for that.\n\n557\n00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.920\nVonne, we do think you for\nwhat we've learned so far.\n\n558\n00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.920\nWe thank you good folks for joining us,\nbut as Vonne said time has expired.\n\n559\n00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.710\nJoin us in part two to see more.\n\n560\n00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:02.519\nThat being said, for OfficeProTV I've\nbeen your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n561\n00:28:02.519 --> 00:28:03.590\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n562\n00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.534\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n563\n00:28:05.534 --> 00:28:10.744\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

It is little tiny.\n\n104\n00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.940\nI mean, even for something that's\nsupposed to be, by the way,\n\n105\n00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.100\ndon't tell anyone about this.\n\n106\n00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.450\nIt's kind of like tucked off, it doesn't\ndraw a lot of attention to itself.\n\n107\n00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I mean,\nwith the high importance,\n\n108\n00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.030\nat least you get that\nred exclamation point.\n\n109\n00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.830\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And that is default says that.\n\n110\n00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.260\n&gt;&gt; That looks almost like an informatic.\n\n111\n00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.800\nI mean, I guess technically it is an\ninformatic, but it's also like an alert.\n\n112\n00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's something that I\nfeel it should be more prominent.\n\n113\n00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.750\nNow, when we get into our organizing and\nchanging and\n\n114\n00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.850\ncustomizing of our views,\nyou could go ahead and add this column,\n\n115\n00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.620\nCuz all of these options are you can\ntreat them as columns in a specific view.\n\n116\n00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.970\nI'm just gonna jump over there really,\nreally quickly because I'm one of those\n\n117\n00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.073\nlike, well, if you're gonna tell me about\nit, why don't you go ahead and show me?\n\n118\n00:06:03.073 --> 00:06:04.610\n[LAUGH] Just don't make me wait til later.\n\n119\n00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.030\nBut I did that a lot anyways.\n\n120\n00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.700\nSorry, guys.\n\n121\n00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.180\nSo we're gonna come over here to View,\nand you can go into your Preview.\n\n122\n00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.060\nAnd you see I have different columns,\nand the column for\n\n123\n00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.980\nsensitivity isn't shown in here.\n\n124\n00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.740\nWell, you can always go into\nyour View Settings, and\n\n125\n00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.470\nyou can come into your Columns.\n\n126\n00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.880\nAgain, I'm going pretty quickly.\n\n127\n00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.145\nBut you could add, you see there\nis sensitivity, see, down there.\n\n128\n00:06:31.145 --> 00:06:33.535\nIt is something that you could display\n\n129\n00:06:34.545 --> 00:06:38.595\nin your View of how you are seeing\nthe lists of your emails.\n\n130\n00:06:38.595 --> 00:06:43.081\nYou could put that in a column, move the\ncolumn up or down, put it into this view.\n\n131\n00:06:43.081 --> 00:06:46.714\nAnd then just like we have a column\nright here with a exclamation point for\n\n132\n00:06:46.714 --> 00:06:49.993\nthe importance, you could have\na column for sensitivity, and so\n\n133\n00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:51.560\nthen that way you could see it.\n\n134\n00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.070\nBut, again, that's something that, I mean,\nI had to go kind of far down into this.\n\n135\n00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.081\nLike, I had to show you\nhow to go to the View tab.\n\n136\n00:06:58.081 --> 00:07:01.209\nYou had to go into the Preview view,\nthen you had to go into the View Settings,\n\n137\n00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:02.668\nthen you had to click on the column.\n\n138\n00:07:02.668 --> 00:07:03.421\nWow!\n[LAUGH]\n\n139\n00:07:03.421 --> 00:07:03.921\n&gt;&gt;

Yes, [LAUGH] we've been so\nmany people in this episode, so.\n\n157\n00:07:18.106 --> 00:07:19.357\n&gt;&gt; It gets confusing, ladies and gents.\n\n158\n00:07:19.357 --> 00:07:25.098\n&gt;&gt; So it says that my message that was to\nLance with this subject was recalled and\n\n159\n00:07:25.098 --> 00:07:27.260\neverything should be fine.\n\n160\n00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:32.188\nI'm gonna switch over to Lance just\nto go ahead and see that, yep,\n\n161\n00:07:32.188 --> 00:07:36.590\nin my inbox,\nI don't see anything that says thanks.\n\n162\n00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.410\nI don't see anything\nthat says in the Sent,\n\n163\n00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.090\nso yeah, you-\n&gt;&gt; Successfully recalled that message.\n\n164\n00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:43.976\n&gt;&gt; You're good.\n\n165\n00:07:43.976 --> 00:07:47.717\nBut if Lance had opened that email,\nthen you wouldn't have been able to do it.\n\n166\n00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:54.318\nAnd I actually have a recall\nthat I have from down here.\n\n167\n00:07:54.318 --> 00:07:55.022\nThere we go.\n\n168\n00:07:55.022 --> 00:07:58.582\nSo you could see that Joey\nsent an email to Justin.\n\n169\n00:07:58.582 --> 00:08:03.138\nAnd the first one to Justin\nwas recalled successfully.\n\n170\n00:08:03.138 --> 00:08:05.690\nCuz I was trying to give you\nan error message as well.\n\n171\n00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.565\nWell, the second one recall to,\nquestion mark,\n\n172\n00:08:09.565 --> 00:08:15.676\nthat one could not be recalled, so Justin\nread it, so you tried and it failed.\n\n173\n00:08:15.676 --> 00:08:20.054\nSo this is your failure message\n[LAUGH] of, it didn't work, so\n\n174\n00:08:20.054 --> 00:08:24.115\nyou better go down that hall and\nstart apologizing, so.\n\n175\n00:08:24.115 --> 00:08:28.164\n&gt;&gt; I wish it would just play\na little MP3 of [SOUND]\n\n176\n00:08:28.164 --> 00:08:29.589\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n177\n00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:30.746\n&gt;&gt; Like, no.\n\n178\n00:08:30.746 --> 00:08:33.336\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you hang your head.\n\n179\n00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:34.822\n&gt;&gt; You failed.\n\n180\n00:08:34.822 --> 00:08:41.066\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so this is great if\nyou're on the same Exchange server.\n\n181\n00:08:41.066 --> 00:08:44.032\nSo what if you're not on\nthe same Exchange server?\n\n182\n00:08:44.032 --> 00:08:45.531\nWhat if you're using Gmail?\n\n183\n00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:46.991\nThat's where it won't work.\n\n184\n00:08:46.991 --> 00:08:48.010\n&gt;&gt; It really doesn't work.\n\n185\n00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:54.039\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I found this on the Internet,\nbut I thought it was a pretty decent one.\n\n186\n00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:58.844\nYou could Google all of this, but I liked\nthis article on this recall-email.com,\n\n187\n00:08:58.844 --> 00:09:00.343\n[LAUGH] rightfully named.\n\n188\n00:09:00.343 --> 00:09:02.338\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, somebody was thinking ahead.\n\n189\n00:09:02.338 --> 00:09:03.692\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's nice,\n\n190\n00:09:03.692 --> 00:09:06.288\ncuz it talks about how the different\nservers that you could do this on.\n\n191\n00:09:06.288 --> 00:09:12.890\nBut the one in Outlook, and the biggest\none, act quickly, you better go quick.\n\n192\n00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.840\nAnd it does have to be that\nyou're on the same Exchange,\n\n193\n00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.510\nwith Exchange account on the same server.\n\n194\n00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.200\nSo even you're on Exchange, but\nit's on a different server.\n\n195\n00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.187\nSo you could see right here,\nsent to a different Exchange server.\n\n196\n00:09:25.187 --> 00:09:28.169\nWe're all using Outlook,\nwe're all using Exchange, but\n\n197\n00:09:28.169 --> 00:09:30.743\nwe're not within the same\ncircle if you wanna say.\n\n198\n00:09:30.743 --> 00:09:32.498\nSo that could be a difference.\n\n199\n00:09:32.498 --> 00:09:37.830\nOr if you're using Yahoo or Gmail outside,\nthen that's not gonna work.\n\n200\n00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:42.713\nAnd it has to be that they\nhaven't opened the email yet.\n\n201\n00:09:42.713 --> 00:09:47.087\nSo those are a couple variants that-\n&gt;&gt; Couple of provisos, yeah.\n\n202\n00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:49.489\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but that's a lot.\n\n203\n00:09:49.489 --> 00:09:52.791\nCuz how many times are you gonna\nbe emailing people that aren't on\n\n204\n00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:54.000\nyour Exchange server?\n\n205\n00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.055\nWhat if you're not even\non an Exchange server?\n\n206\n00:09:56.055 --> 00:09:59.501\nWhat if you start doing something that,\nsomebody's just sitting there reading\n\n207\n00:09:59.501 --> 00:10:01.689\ntheir email every single\nsecond that they come in?\n\n208\n00:10:01.689 --> 00:10:06.560\nSo you shouldn't rely on this\nas your kinda safety net.\n\n209\n00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.000\nJust really think before you send.\n\n210\n00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.530\nAnd then it goes through the same\noptions that we just did.\n\n211\n00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.785\nIt is in the actions,\nthere's not that button.\n\n212\n00:10:15.785 --> 00:10:18.120\n[LAUGH] Not that one, it's this one.\n\n213\n00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.630\nSo I think they kinda look the same.\n\n214\n00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; There's two little things in there.\n\n215\n00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:23.990\n&gt;&gt; We all make mistakes.\n\n216\n00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.858\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n217\n00:10:24.858 --> 00:10:25.754\n&gt;&gt; But you can't recall that.\n\n218\n00:10:25.754 --> 00:10:26.274\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n219\n00:10:26.274 --> 00:10:30.094\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, [LAUGH] so that email, or the,\n\n220\n00:10:30.094 --> 00:10:31.180\nwhat is this?\n\n221\n00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.803\nThis is a web page that I\nwanted a reference for that.\n\n222\n00:10:33.803 --> 00:10:35.738\nI just thought it was\npretty decent information.\n\n223\n00:10:35.738 --> 00:10:38.535\nAnd so, that is recall messages.\n\n224\n00:10:38.535 --> 00:10:45.524\nThe other topic that we mentioned\nwas the mention, the whole @whoever.\n\n225\n00:10:45.524 --> 00:10:49.254\nI have emails that somebody emailed.\n\n226\n00:10:49.254 --> 00:10:55.505\n[LAUGH] I had like, you're the receiver\nof this, and let me find it, there it is.\n\n227\n00:10:55.505 --> 00:11:00.687\nOkay, so Justin Timberlake used this\nfeature in the body of his email.\n\n228\n00:11:00.687 --> 00:11:03.662\nAnd I know that I have a mention.\n\n229\n00:11:03.662 --> 00:11:05.191\nIt's like, I've been tagged in a photo.\n\n230\n00:11:05.191 --> 00:11:09.459\nYou know how Facebook if you have certain\nparameters, you have to be alerted that\n\n231\n00:11:09.459 --> 00:11:13.691\nyou were tagged in a photo and be able to\naccept it before that person can tag you?\n\n232\n00:11:13.691 --> 00:11:18.189\nSo it's sort of like that,\nthat I've got to mention.\n\n233\n00:11:18.189 --> 00:11:23.939\nAnd I'm gonna click on this, and\nyou notice shout out to @JoeyFatone and\n\n234\n00:11:23.939 --> 00:11:28.032\n@LanceBass for\ngetting the tour bus back in order.\n\n235\n00:11:28.032 --> 00:11:32.621\nAnd it actually has it looking like\nin Facebook like you're tagging,\n\n236\n00:11:32.621 --> 00:11:34.739\nit's to that specific person.\n\n237\n00:11:34.739 --> 00:11:35.907\nYou can tell I don't use Twitter.\n\n238\n00:11:35.907 --> 00:11:36.836\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n239\n00:11:36.836 --> 00:11:38.368\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm like,\n\n240\n00:11:38.368 --> 00:11:40.003\n[LAUGH] I think this is\na whole Twitter thing.\n\n241\n00:11:40.003 --> 00:11:41.189\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There are some people going,\n\n242\n00:11:41.189 --> 00:11:42.383\nI follow Vonne on Twitter,\nand it's not really her.\n\n243\n00:11:42.383 --> 00:11:47.293\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is me, I do check it.\n\n244\n00:11:47.293 --> 00:11:47.907\n&gt;&gt; You do, yeah.\n\n245\n00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:49.660\n&gt;&gt; I get the alerts and everything.\n\n246\n00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.267\nThat's why you have a great\nsocial media manager.\n\n247\n00:11:52.267 --> 00:11:52.862\n&gt;&gt; They do help.\n\n248\n00:11:52.862 --> 00:11:56.907\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes,\nthey're a very valuable person.\n\n249\n00:11:56.907 --> 00:11:57.804\n&gt;&gt; Worth their money.\n\n250\n00:11:57.804 --> 00:12:02.029\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, so you could see that I\nhave that, those are the shoutouts and so\n\n251\n00:12:02.029 --> 00:12:02.980\nI get a mention.\n\n252\n00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:09.664\nYou do have to be on, well,\nwhat does this matter in a sense?\n\n253\n00:12:09.664 --> 00:12:15.282\nAnd if nobody's using it, then it's really\njust another tag, another category.\n\n254\n00:12:15.282 --> 00:12:20.661\nAnother thing that kind of helps\ncompartmentalize your emails and\n\n255\n00:12:20.661 --> 00:12:21.916\nhow you use it.\n\n256\n00:12:21.916 --> 00:12:26.726\nNotice in this particular layout\nthat I have, I have the top level\n\n257\n00:12:26.726 --> 00:12:31.371\nsorts on the top row that I could\nsort if by, did I get a mention?\n\n258\n00:12:31.371 --> 00:12:34.375\nSo I could find all the emails\nthat it's filtering and\n\n259\n00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:37.592\nshowing me only the results\nthat I have mentions in here.\n\n260\n00:12:37.592 --> 00:12:40.921\nAnd I can go back to the All, and\nif you're in a newer interface,\n\n261\n00:12:40.921 --> 00:12:43.883\nwe had a whole episode about\nthat with the Focused Inbox,\n\n262\n00:12:43.883 --> 00:12:45.940\nabout how they changed the interface.\n\n263\n00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.893\nI'm gonna switch on over here to JT.\n\n264\n00:12:47.893 --> 00:12:50.655\nNotice that JT doesn't\nhave that same button.\n\n265\n00:12:50.655 --> 00:12:55.288\nBut I could go ahead and use\nthe Mentioned in that dropdown for All.\n\n266\n00:12:55.288 --> 00:12:59.319\nAnd you can see that Justin Timberlake\nwas mentioned in here.\n\n267\n00:12:59.319 --> 00:13:06.550\nThis was Joey sending the email to Justin,\nand tagged Justin in this email.\n\n268\n00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:07.285\nSo many people in here.\n\n269\n00:13:07.285 --> 00:13:10.838\n&gt;&gt; So you just have to do the @ symbol and\nthen their Outlook name?\n\n270\n00:13:10.838 --> 00:13:12.170\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n271\n00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.747\n&gt;&gt; However it shows up in\nthe address book or something?\n\n272\n00:13:14.747 --> 00:13:18.107\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I was showing you how\nthe end result of it's in there.\n\n273\n00:13:18.107 --> 00:13:21.395\nSo what about composing\na message with that?\n\n274\n00:13:21.395 --> 00:13:24.509\nLet's go over here to Home,\nand we'll go to New Email.\n\n275\n00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:26.810\nThis does connect with your contacts,\n\n276\n00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:31.004\nwhich we haven't gone over in this\nseries just yet if you're in order.\n\n277\n00:13:31.004 --> 00:13:34.868\nSo we haven't done contacts, so\nyou do have to have that set up.\n\n278\n00:13:34.868 --> 00:13:36.908\nIf you don't have any of\nthat in your contacts,\n\n279\n00:13:36.908 --> 00:13:38.650\nthis isn't necessarily going to work.\n\n280\n00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.800\nNow, I also should clarify that contacts,\nbut\n\n281\n00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.250\nyou also have global address books,\nlike global address.\n\n282\n00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:49.310\nSo you'd have to have one or both, or\n\n283\n00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:54.930\nsomething that Outlook could understand\nyou've got somebody that your mentioning.\n\n284\n00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.270\nLet me show you.\n\n285\n00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.310\nSo this is going to be from Joey.\n\n286\n00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:03.346\nI just had that From field\nfrom our previous episodes.\n\n287\n00:14:03.346 --> 00:14:06.244\nWe're gonna address this to Chris,\nhow about that?\n\n288\n00:14:06.244 --> 00:14:08.260\nSo yes, there's Chris.\n\n289\n00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.280\nCome on, Chris, there we go.\n\n290\n00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:18.280\nAnd then we're gonna put in the title,\nmentions, and we're gonna say, great job!\n\n291\n00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.390\nThis is where, if I use the @ sign, and\n\n292\n00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:25.730\nnotice, as soon as I type that @ sign,\nit is pulling from my contacts.\n\n293\n00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:30.370\nSo, in my contacts, I have Chris,\nI have Justin, I have myself,\n\n294\n00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.958\nas Lance, I have me, and\nI have a couple other people in there.\n\n295\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:38.640\nSo you could see that I want to say,\n@Justin Timberlake and\n\n296\n00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.030\nit just pops it right in there.\n\n297\n00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.452\nAlso, look what just\nhappened in the To field.\n\n298\n00:14:42.452 --> 00:14:43.901\nJustin gets added in the To field.\n\n299\n00:14:43.901 --> 00:14:44.525\n&gt;&gt;

I'm not gonna get any\nkinda cool notification.\n\n308\n00:15:09.385 --> 00:15:10.184\n&gt;&gt; No, you're not.\n\n309\n00:15:10.184 --> 00:15:13.154\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's one, it has to be connected\n\n310\n00:15:13.154 --> 00:15:17.106\nto your contacts, but\nI do think that's a nice, little feature.\n\n311\n00:15:17.106 --> 00:15:20.167\nTo where, I need to bring Lance in,\nlet me just do @Lance.\n\n312\n00:15:20.167 --> 00:15:24.302\nAnd that way you could even do\nmaybe in a list like, hey Justin,\n\n313\n00:15:24.302 --> 00:15:26.031\nyou're going to do this.\n\n314\n00:15:26.031 --> 00:15:27.200\nLance, you're going to do this.\n\n315\n00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.657\nWe're planning that party for JC, so\nLance, make sure you bring that cheese.\n\n316\n00:15:31.657 --> 00:15:36.593\nAnd Justin, go ahead and\nbring the boombox, I just said boombox.\n\n317\n00:15:36.593 --> 00:15:38.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just dated myself, okay.\n\n318\n00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.656\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna do some popping and\n\n319\n00:15:41.656 --> 00:15:43.609\nlocking and watch electric bugaloo, right?\n\n320\n00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:45.032\n&gt;&gt; Pop and Lochness Monster.\n\n321\n00:15:45.032 --> 00:15:45.569\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n322\n00:15:45.569 --> 00:15:48.944\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So yes, but you're gonna go\n\n323\n00:15:48.944 --> 00:15:54.947\nahead and use this feature to go ahead and\ncall people out and put it into the To.\n\n324\n00:15:54.947 --> 00:15:58.556\nAnd then when you send it,\nif they're using Outlook,\n\n325\n00:15:58.556 --> 00:16:04.200\nthen they could use that filter that is in\nOutlook to go ahead and sort their mail.\n\n326\n00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.170\nI should say filter cuz\nfiltering does filter.\n\n327\n00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.210\nSorting does sorting.\n\n328\n00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:09.249\nIt's kinda different, but\nwe use them interchangeably.\n\n329\n00:16:09.249 --> 00:16:12.166\nSo anyways, you could go ahead and\nuse that as a category to say,\n\n330\n00:16:12.166 --> 00:16:13.786\nhow many mentions do I have?\n\n331\n00:16:13.786 --> 00:16:14.897\nI only have one.\n\n332\n00:16:14.897 --> 00:16:20.760\n[LAUGH] But that's how it works and\nit's pretty handy if you have contacts.\n\n333\n00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.825\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff.\n\n334\n00:16:21.825 --> 00:16:24.091\nNow we know how we can work\nout what these mentions.\n\n335\n00:16:24.091 --> 00:16:28.957\nAnd kinda start tagging our friends, or\nanything that people need a cool mention,\n\n336\n00:16:28.957 --> 00:16:30.810\nlike Vonne was showing us.\n\n337\n00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:32.106\nYou guys did a great job.\n\n338\n00:16:32.106 --> 00:16:36.786\nKinda gives them a little\nextra bit of social status.\n\n339\n00:16:36.786 --> 00:16:39.985\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Social status\nwithin Outlook Exchange.\n\n340\n00:16:39.985 --> 00:16:42.301\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, hey,\nI'm trying to sell it here, honey.\n\n341\n00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:44.745\nDon't [LAUGH] throw shade on me here.\n\n342\n00:16:44.745 --> 00:16:46.059\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n343\n00:16:46.059 --> 00:16:49.020\nThat being said,\nthis is our last thing we wanted to show\n\n344\n00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.370\nyou guys when it came to advanced\nfeatures inside of Outlook.\n\n345\n00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:53.678\nThe cool options that they give us.\n\n346\n00:16:53.678 --> 00:16:57.109\nVonne, we do thank you for\nwalking us through this.\n\n347\n00:16:57.109 --> 00:16:58.943\nWe could see how all these things work.\n\n348\n00:16:58.943 --> 00:17:02.669\nBut looks like we've come to the end of\nthis little miniseries inside the series,\n\n349\n00:17:02.669 --> 00:17:04.127\nso thank you guys for watching.\n\n350\n00:17:04.127 --> 00:17:06.240\nWe're signing off for OfficeProTV.\n\n351\n00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.460\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n352\n00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.534\n&gt;&gt;

do you want my signature,\nI'm going to be famous soon, so\n\n16\n00:00:41.776 --> 00:00:43.869\nI don't know what to for, but [LAUGH].\n\n17\n00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:45.862\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We are going-\n\n18\n00:00:45.862 --> 00:00:46.895\n&gt;&gt; Man review it.\n\n19\n00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:48.484\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n20\n00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:53.505\nThat's kind of my goal\nin life right now so.\n\n21\n00:00:53.505 --> 00:00:56.200\n[LAUGH] What we're gonna be\ntalking about in these is like\n\n22\n00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.930\nending our e-mails with the signature.\n\n23\n00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.760\nSo why don't I go ahead and show you some\nexamples of signatures right here in\n\n24\n00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.530\nJT's inbox right now.\n\n25\n00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.170\nSo JT has created a couple\nof signatures and\n\n26\n00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.590\nhe sent an e-mail to\nJoey with that signature.\n\n27\n00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.450\nSo you could see right here,\nlet me go ahead and open this so\n\n28\n00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.320\nwe can get this a little bit bigger.\n\n29\n00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.580\nSo this was from Justin.\n\n30\n00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.770\nIt says, hello Joey,\nhere is my fancy signature.\n\n31\n00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.130\nMaybe you've seen these in e-mails that\nyou've gotten from other people where they\n\n32\n00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.470\nhave their photo and they have their name,\nand there's a link to their websites and\n\n33\n00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.060\nmaybe some other things.\n\n34\n00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.800\nI think we were talking about signatures\nthat we've seen throughout the years of,\n\n35\n00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.220\nthey're like 50 lines long,\ndancing rainbows.\n\n36\n00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.920\n&gt;&gt; GIFs all over the joint,\nand stars and sparkles and\n\n37\n00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.010\nunicorns, and it gets, and\nthat's not an exaggeration.\n\n38\n00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.970\nI've literally seen those\ntype of signatures.\n\n39\n00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.860\n&gt;&gt; And I'm like I would love\nto have a signature like that.\n\n40\n00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.040\n&gt;&gt; Well, and it's like and\nwhere was that site again?\n\n41\n00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.760\nI just want it for reference purposes.\n\n42\n00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.470\n&gt;&gt; I would love some rainbows, and\nsome dancing unicorns, and bears,\n\n43\n00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.610\nand everything,\nthat would be fantastic, so.\n\n44\n00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.720\n&gt;&gt; It's the person that gets them\nthat are like goodness gracious.\n\n45\n00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we should probably keep\nour signatures tasteful, right?\n\n46\n00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.480\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Like anything here.\n\n47\n00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.340\n&gt;&gt; Appropriate toward the end, so\nif you're in a business, rainbows and\n\n48\n00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.420\nunicorns, as cool as that may be,\nprobably not,\n\n49\n00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.720\nit's not inappropriate,\nit doesn't lend itself.\n\n50\n00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.610\n&gt;&gt; Depends on where you work.\n\n51\n00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.580\n&gt;&gt; That's true, that's true.\n\n52\n00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.340\nYou can be in a creative outlet.\n\n53\n00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.690\nYou have to stay relevant.\n\n54\n00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.150\nThat's what I'm looking for.\n\n55\n00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.097\nIt's not relevant to your business and\n\n56\n00:02:25.097 --> 00:02:28.474\npeople might go why you keep giving\nme these rainbows and unicorns?\n\n57\n00:02:28.474 --> 00:02:29.230\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n58\n00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.690\nthe other one that I always think\nabout is if the same signature for\n\n59\n00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.430\neverything, and if you've gone back and\nforth with somebody over and\n\n60\n00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.420\nover again, and every single\nreply has that 50 line signature.\n\n61\n00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.130\nIt's kinda like, I get it.\n\n62\n00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.890\nI get who you are.\n\n63\n00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.690\nSo, let's maybe not use that signature.\n\n64\n00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.180\nWell, you can control that in Outlook.\n\n65\n00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.590\nYou can determine, hey,\n\n66\n00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.040\nanytime I start a new message, I want\nthis to always be my default signature.\n\n67\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.200\nOr, maybe not set a default signature.\n\n68\n00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.170\nYou can go ahead and pick which ones\nyou want because maybe you have\n\n69\n00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.280\nmultiple signatures, maybe you have\npeople that you deal with that\n\n70\n00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.350\nyour specific title is\nthe director of awesomeness.\n\n71\n00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.374\nAnd I think actually somebody\nhere has that title.\n\n72\n00:03:12.374 --> 00:03:14.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The director of awesomeness.\n\n73\n00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.930\n&gt;&gt; And then maybe, so those are your\npeople within your organization.\n\n74\n00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.370\nBut to the outside organization,\nyou're the director of marketing, or\n\n75\n00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.960\nsomething to that sense.\n\n76\n00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.090\nAnd so you can pick which signature\nyou want to insert into your message,\n\n77\n00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.410\nand when you want it to do it by default.\n\n78\n00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.649\nAnd all of those kind of\nsettings that you can, well, set.\n\n79\n00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:37.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So here's Justin's fancy\n\n80\n00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.715\nsignature with his address and\na link to his Wikipedia page.\n\n81\n00:03:41.715 --> 00:03:43.839\n&gt;&gt; Is that his actual address?\n\n82\n00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:44.969\nRoad.\nIs that what it says?\n\n83\n00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:45.580\nMiraval Lane.\n\n84\n00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.530\nYou made that up.\n\n85\n00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.455\n&gt;&gt; Well, yes I, well,\nit's not, I made it up.\n\n86\n00:03:50.455 --> 00:03:51.355\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n87\n00:03:51.355 --> 00:03:52.290\n&gt;&gt; That's his actual signature.\n\n88\n00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.315\n&gt;&gt; Miraval is one of his tours.\n\n89\n00:03:54.315 --> 00:03:56.268\nOkay, so and then from.\n\n90\n00:03:56.268 --> 00:04:00.102\nBut 12345 is not the right zip code but-\n&gt;&gt; No, probably not.\n\n91\n00:04:00.102 --> 00:04:01.352\n&gt;&gt; Anyways-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n92\n00:04:01.352 --> 00:04:05.632\n&gt;&gt; Huge JT fan over here ladies and gents.\n\n93\n00:04:05.632 --> 00:04:08.180\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nJust slightly, so [LAUGH]\n\n94\n00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.470\nwe have his signature and you can see that\nJoey said hey nice picture, that's great.\n\n95\n00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.900\nAnd then back here that the one that,\nI have it to where he says thanks and\n\n96\n00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.090\nthere's another signature.\n\n97\n00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.330\nHere, let me switch over to Joey.\n\n98\n00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.380\nThere we go.\n\n99\n00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.030\nThere's Joey's response from Justin.\n\n100\n00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.630\nIt says, hey, thanks.\n\n101\n00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.590\nAnd you can see Justin Timberlake is\nthe CEO of JT and the Tennessee Kids.\n\n102\n00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.320\nSo he has a different signature for\n\n103\n00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.270\nhis reply than the one that\nhe sent on the new message.\n\n104\n00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.930\nSo that's different ways you control.\n\n105\n00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.710\nSo I'm going over all the things\nthat we're going to create in\n\n106\n00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.510\njust a little bit.\n\n107\n00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.890\nBut I wanted to just demonstrate\nthe end result before we go ahead.\n\n108\n00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.050\nWell, then tell me how I make that.\n\n109\n00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.490\nBe there in just one minute.\n\n110\n00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.560\nI'm going to come over here to JT.\n\n111\n00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.090\nSo we're back in Justin Timberlake's\ne-mail, and we are gonna go ahead and\n\n112\n00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.790\nclick on the new e-mail button.\n\n113\n00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.350\nAnd notice that there is\nnothing in here by default.\n\n114\n00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:06.272\nI did not set to go ahead and make all\nnew messages have a signature by default.\n\n115\n00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:09.140\nI want to be able to go ahead and\nput that in whenever I'm ready.\n\n116\n00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.662\nNow, you could put in in at the beginning,\nyou could go ahead and\n\n117\n00:05:11.662 --> 00:05:13.620\ndo it when you are done with the message.\n\n118\n00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.480\nIt doesn't matter,\nit's always just gonna go ahead and\n\n119\n00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.550\nput it at the end of\nwhatever your message is.\n\n120\n00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.710\nSo I'll just say hello.\n\n121\n00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.980\nOver here on the message tab,\nin the signature button over here,\n\n122\n00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.560\ntowards the right,\nif I click this drop down.\n\n123\n00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.680\nNotice I have a couple\ndifferent named signatures.\n\n124\n00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.780\nI have simple, fancy and\nbusiness card signature.\n\n125\n00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.520\nI made those up.\n\n126\n00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.700\nSo those are, you are going to be able\nto name your different signatures\n\n127\n00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.670\nto whatever it means to you.\n\n128\n00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.820\nSo if I click the simple signature,\n\n129\n00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.060\nyou can see this is the one that\njust has his name and his title.\n\n130\n00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.770\nIf I go ahead and switch this to fancy,\n\n131\n00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.090\nnotice that this is the fancy one\nwhere it has a picture and a link.\n\n132\n00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.850\nThe other type is where\nyou could go ahead and\n\n133\n00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.550\ninsert what is known as a business card.\n\n134\n00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.690\nAnd you can see the business\ncard almost looks like\n\n135\n00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.330\nthe physical business card that you\nwold hand out to people on paper.\n\n136\n00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.864\n&gt;&gt; Does it work like a contact\nwhere you would click on that and\n\n137\n00:06:06.864 --> 00:06:08.540\nimport that as a contact?\n\n138\n00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.640\n&gt;&gt; You've received these haven't you?\n\n139\n00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.190\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH] that's exactly what it is.\n\n140\n00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.630\nBecause this VCF, virtual card form,\n\n141\n00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.845\ncontact form, I really don't know\nwhat the extension c is for.\n\n142\n00:06:20.845 --> 00:06:22.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was trying to make it up as I go.\n\n143\n00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.390\nBut yes, it is associated with contacts.\n\n144\n00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.460\nAnd while we haven't really gotten\ninto contacts within Outlook just yet,\n\n145\n00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.530\nwe're still in the e-mail portion,\nit does coincide with that.\n\n146\n00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.540\nAnd so, Justin created-\n&gt;&gt; Virtual contact file.\n\n147\n00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.240\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\nI was close [LAUGH].\n\n148\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.930\n&gt;&gt; Very close.\n\n149\n00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.100\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I was saying card, but contact.\n\n150\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.432\nSo Justin went ahead and\ncreated his own contact.\n\n151\n00:06:45.432 --> 00:06:48.820\nWait, I have to make my\nown contact in my context?\n\n152\n00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.700\nI think I know myself.\n\n153\n00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.920\nWell, the reason why you\nwould do that is for\n\n154\n00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.560\nyou to be able to create\na business card just like this.\n\n155\n00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.890\nAnd then you send it just like you\nwould be handling somebody out,\n\n156\n00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.060\nyour business card.\n\n157\n00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.161\nThey receive this e-mail,\nthey can click on that VCF file and\n\n158\n00:07:05.161 --> 00:07:08.020\nit will import directly\ninto those contacts.\n\n159\n00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.600\nSo maybe you've seen these before,\nmaybe you haven't.\n\n160\n00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.550\nBut maybe now, hey, I think I want to\ndo that, especially when I'm trying\n\n161\n00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:19.284\nto give my information to maybe an outside\nvendor or somebody that I'm working with.\n\n162\n00:07:19.284 --> 00:07:20.596\nHey, it's great to meet you.\n\n163\n00:07:20.596 --> 00:07:22.150\nGreat that we talked on the phone.\n\n164\n00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.060\nHere's my business card.\n\n165\n00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.260\nAnd then you could go ahead and send that.\n\n166\n00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.000\nSo these are the different choices,\nsome different examples of where,\n\n167\n00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.190\nwhat kind of signatures you can create.\n\n168\n00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.602\nSo let's go ahead and create them.\n\n169\n00:07:33.602 --> 00:07:35.140\nI'm going to not save the changes.\n\n170\n00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.460\nLet's jump over to Joey.\n\n171\n00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.100\nWhere do I make my signatures?\n\n172\n00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.460\nYou can go into the Options and\ngo to the signatures from there.\n\n173\n00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.540\nAnd I'll take you there.\n\n174\n00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.190\nGo to File.\n\n175\n00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.194\nWe go to Options.\n\n176\n00:07:48.194 --> 00:07:53.331\nAnd in the mail section over here on the\nleft, you can see right there, signatures.\n\n177\n00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:56.336\nAnd then it opens up this dialogue box.\n\n178\n00:07:56.336 --> 00:07:58.187\nWe actually went here once before,\n\n179\n00:07:58.187 --> 00:08:01.960\nwhen we were talking about Stationery\nback in the format message body.\n\n180\n00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.430\nSo this dialogue box has\nthe two tabs across the top\n\n181\n00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.700\nof our personal stationery,\nand our email signature.\n\n182\n00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.290\nAnd so\nyou can see that these are the ones where\n\n183\n00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.520\nwe're going to be making\nour new signature.\n\n184\n00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.050\nOver here on the right,\n\n185\n00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:20.580\nit has what default signatures you\nwould like to choose for new messages,\n\n186\n00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:26.390\nand then ones that you could set for\nreplies, or forwards to people.\n\n187\n00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.350\nSo that's one way you can get to it.\n\n188\n00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.680\nThe other way you could get to this,\nlet me cancel it.\n\n189\n00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.592\nI'm gonna start a new message, and\nover here, this is where we were inserting\n\n190\n00:08:34.592 --> 00:08:37.870\nthe signatures from back when I\nwas showing you Justin's email.\n\n191\n00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.700\nI don't have anything with Joey.\n\n192\n00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.000\nJoey doesn't have any\ncreated signatures yet.\n\n193\n00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.640\nSo those signatures dot, dot,\ndot will take you to the same place.\n\n194\n00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.780\nSo whichever way you want to get to it,\nyou're still gonna need to get to this\n\n195\n00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:55.110\ndialog box to go ahead and create,\ndelete, or edit any of your signatures.\n\n196\n00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.270\nSo why don't we start with a simple one?\n\n197\n00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.428\nWe'll go with new,\nyou name it whatever you want.\n\n198\n00:09:00.428 --> 00:09:05.790\nWe'll say simple, and I'm just gonna\ngo with Joey so I can remember,\n\n199\n00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.960\nI am in Joey's inbox, yeah, but it's\ngood to, all these little reminders for\n\n200\n00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.710\nmyself to keep myself organized when I'm\nmanaging three different email accounts.\n\n201\n00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:18.540\nSo we'll click OK, and\nnow I've made the name,\n\n202\n00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.050\nnow you're gonna go ahead and create it.\n\n203\n00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:25.650\nDown here in this area, this is the, it's\nnot the message body, it's the signature\n\n204\n00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.310\nbody, we'll call it that, to where we\ncan go ahead and edit our signature.\n\n205\n00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.240\nWhat is his name?\n\n206\n00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:37.310\nHis name is Joey, Joey Fatone,\nand he is the funny one of,\n\n207\n00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:42.410\nwell, he's not JT and the Tennessee Kids.\n\n208\n00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:48.040\nHe's the funny one of best boy band ever.\n\n209\n00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:48.805\nHow about that?\n\n210\n00:09:48.805 --> 00:09:51.040\n[LAUGH] Very simple.\n\n211\n00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.890\nSome text.\n\n212\n00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.570\nWe could go ahead and\nselect our text here.\n\n213\n00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.960\nI will say that, I don't know if it's\nmy virtual machine, or something,\n\n214\n00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.300\nit's not wanting to select the text\nby dragging for some reason.\n\n215\n00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.550\nBut if I use the keyboard.\n\n216\n00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.560\n&gt;&gt; It works fine.\n\n217\n00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe it's a flaw within\nmy little system right there.\n\n218\n00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.800\nIt's just like a tiny little bug,\nbut my workaround, so\n\n219\n00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.460\nif yours isn't doing it,\njust use your Shift key.\n\n220\n00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.870\nIf you hold your Shift key and\nuse your arrow keys,\n\n221\n00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:22.520\nthat's how you can select your text when\nyour mouse, in this case, isn't working.\n\n222\n00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.955\nI can change the font.\n\n223\n00:10:24.955 --> 00:10:26.680\nMaybe I'll make this Arial Black.\n\n224\n00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.080\nMaybe it'll make it a little bit bigger.\n\n225\n00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.900\nAnd how about we pick a color?\n\n226\n00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:32.792\nLet's go with purple.\n\n227\n00:10:32.792 --> 00:10:33.696\nI'm wearing purple today.\n\n228\n00:10:33.696 --> 00:10:34.540\nWe'll go with purple.\n\n229\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.146\nThere you go, simple as that.\n\n230\n00:10:37.146 --> 00:10:38.920\nSo I can say, that's what I like.\n\n231\n00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.316\nI go ahead and click Save.\n\n232\n00:10:40.316 --> 00:10:42.870\nYou should probably get in\nthe habit of doing that.\n\n233\n00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.500\nI've done stuff where I click, OK,\nand it still saves, and it's fine.\n\n234\n00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.991\nOther times, for some reason, it doesn't.\n\n235\n00:10:47.991 --> 00:10:51.610\nSo we should probably do the-\n&gt;&gt; Safely.\n\n236\n00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:55.390\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah,\nmake sure we've got the save step done.\n\n237\n00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.040\nIt is now grayed out so\nit understands that\n\n238\n00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:03.150\nall the changes that I've made to the\nsimple Joey's signature have been applied.\n\n239\n00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.950\nI click OK now and\nI have created a signature.\n\n240\n00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:12.280\nSo in my message that I'm creating,\nI want to insert that signature.\n\n241\n00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.230\nIt is now in my little list, and\nI click on it, and it goes ahead and\n\n242\n00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.990\ngoes right in.\n\n243\n00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Vonne, I like this.\n\n244\n00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.990\nSignatures are not too difficult.\n\n245\n00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.170\nThey are very straight forward.\n\n246\n00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:22.710\nThis is a very easy process.\n\n247\n00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.489\nWe're not talking about\nrocket surgery here, right,\n\n248\n00:11:25.489 --> 00:11:28.870\nit doesn't take a scientist and\na PhD degree to create a signature.\n\n249\n00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.600\nVery simple, straightforward,\nyou just need to know where to click,\n\n250\n00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.960\nhow to get to these signature areas so\nthat you can easily edit, create,\n\n251\n00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.505\nand save your signature.\n\n252\n00:11:37.505 --> 00:11:41.110\nPut your name, your contact information,\nmaybe your business you work for,\n\n253\n00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:44.230\nphone number, email address,\nvery simple stuff, very straight forward.\n\n254\n00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:45.936\nAnd then once you get that figured out,\n\n255\n00:11:45.936 --> 00:11:48.360\nthen we can dive into\nsomething more complex.\n\n256\n00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.220\nThat is a perfect segue.\n\n257\n00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.742\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As to where we're going\n\n258\n00:11:50.742 --> 00:11:54.970\nnext because yes, I think, like you're\nsaying, this is straight forward.\n\n259\n00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.590\nWhat if I did want to go ahead and\nadd, maybe, my website address?\n\n260\n00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.090\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n261\n00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.190\n&gt;&gt; I wanna put ITProTV in here.\n\n262\n00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.930\nI'm combining boy bands and ITPROTV, but\n\n263\n00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.030\nI'm just thinking of a website\nthat I could go to quickly.\n\n264\n00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.212\nSo I like this signature,\nbut I want to edit it.\n\n265\n00:12:09.212 --> 00:12:12.690\nI wanna add the phone number and\nthe website.\n\n266\n00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:13.510\nWhere do I go?\n\n267\n00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.710\nSame place we were just in.\n\n268\n00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.320\nWe come into Signatures.\n\n269\n00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.960\nI am with the only signature that I have.\n\n270\n00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.750\nAnd so I'm coming down here, into the\nEdit Signature, and anything that I add,\n\n271\n00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.710\nthat's where that whole Save button that\nI was saying, always make sure you save.\n\n272\n00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.640\nSo we're going to go ahead and\ncommit those changes.\n\n273\n00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.930\nLet's put our phone\nnumber as 888-555-1234.\n\n274\n00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.030\nCuz I'm sure that's the phone number.\n\n275\n00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.260\nI do wanna put in a web address.\n\n276\n00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:43.159\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and jump\ndown into my browser, and I will type in\n\n277\n00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:48.840\nITPro.TV to make sure that I'm getting\nthe direct address right from the browser.\n\n278\n00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:55.120\nSo I can take this, go ahead and copy it,\ncome back down into the signature.\n\n279\n00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:02.130\nNow I could put in the address just as\nthe web address where I could just paste\n\n280\n00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:06.760\nit in and there is the HTTPS ITProTV,\nand I could put that in.\n\n281\n00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:12.940\nBut maybe I wanted to say, click here for\njoining ITProTV, or something to that\n\n282\n00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.770\neffect, instead of just seeing the web,\nI want it to be attached to some words.\n\n283\n00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:19.980\nSo that is where you could go ahead and\ninsert a hyperlink.\n\n284\n00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:24.500\nAnd I'll say our website.\n\n285\n00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.370\nI personally,\nI like when the address is out there,\n\n286\n00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.080\nrather than having the words\nwith the link on it.\n\n287\n00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.480\n&gt;&gt; Well you've got to worry about phishing\nscams nowadays where people like say,\n\n288\n00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.310\ngo to FedEx.com, or Facebook, or\nwhatever, and you click on it and\n\n289\n00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.510\nit looks like Facebook, it looks like\nFedEx, it looks like whatever, but\n\n290\n00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:45.270\nit's actually an evil site that's\ngathering information about you, or worse.\n\n291\n00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.000\nSo I'm with you Vonne,\n\n292\n00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.970\nit's alway good to know exactly what\nis that web address that I'm following.\n\n293\n00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:55.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would say our website,\ncolon, and then the web address so\n\n294\n00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.060\nthey know what it is.\n\n295\n00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:01.540\nI'm kind of labeling it, but I'm also\nshowing the address as the address.\n\n296\n00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:06.070\nSo that's a personal preference that\nI prefer, and like for your saying,\n\n297\n00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:09.370\nI think for security issues people might\nnot want to click on it because they're\n\n298\n00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:13.150\nvery scared of phishing and\nscams, so maybe not.\n\n299\n00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.310\nBut just to show you, the click,\nhold and drag just went.\n\n300\n00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.820\nIt just worked.\n\n301\n00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.410\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes it works,\nsometimes it doesn't.\n\n302\n00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.149\n&gt;&gt; It hasn't been working for me for\ndays [LAUGH] but that's okay.\n\n303\n00:14:21.149 --> 00:14:22.960\nWe'll go with it now, it's fine.\n\n304\n00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.430\nSo I'm selecting the text.\n\n305\n00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:28.370\nI can come over here to the Add\na hyperlink button over on the right hand\n\n306\n00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:33.620\nside of my Editor, and then I can\npaste the address right into here.\n\n307\n00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.440\nSo the text displaying is our website.\n\n308\n00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:41.610\nThe address that it's going to go to is\nITProTV, and I can insert that hyperlink.\n\n309\n00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.300\nSo these are the just basic\nbuttons that we've gone across,\n\n310\n00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.760\nall the formatting, and then the link.\n\n311\n00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.120\nAnd then this is, I believe,\ninsert a picture.\n\n312\n00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:50.655\nYes it is.\n\n313\n00:14:50.655 --> 00:14:51.779\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, the reason all\n\n314\n00:14:51.779 --> 00:14:55.690\nthis is working is because our editor\nhere, it actually reads HTML, correct?\n\n315\n00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:57.618\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n316\n00:14:57.618 --> 00:15:01.890\n&gt;&gt; It's actually interpreting and\nunderstanding that HTML tagging and code.\n\n317\n00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:02.400\nYes, and\n\n318\n00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.230\nthat's a good point because this is HTML,\nthe way it's formatting everything.\n\n319\n00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:10.760\nIf you were sending plain text emails with\nthis, then it's not gonna understand it\n\n320\n00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.876\nbecause the plain text is not HTML so it's\nnot in a language that it understands.\n\n321\n00:15:14.876 --> 00:15:18.239\nAnd the reason why I didn't know what\nthis button was right off the bat was cuz\n\n322\n00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.880\nI wanna put it in a picture.\n\n323\n00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.670\nYou don't wanna put it here.\n\n324\n00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.730\nIt doesn't always work the right way.\n\n325\n00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.890\nI do not know why, I really don't.\n\n326\n00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:30.950\nBut I have a workaround for you.\n\n327\n00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:31.960\nAnd I have notes.\n\n328\n00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:37.010\nAnd there is actual website in the show\nnotes that you can go to that talks about\n\n329\n00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:42.360\nhow to take photos into your signatures,\nand why you want to do that.\n\n330\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.130\nSo definitely check that out,\nbut I will show you how to do it.\n\n331\n00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.310\nFor now,\nwe are editing our simple signature.\n\n332\n00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.660\nWe're going to save our changes to this.\n\n333\n00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.784\nClick OK, insert our signature again.\n\n334\n00:15:53.784 --> 00:15:57.429\nAnd now you can see that it\ndidn't do two signatures.\n\n335\n00:15:57.429 --> 00:16:00.971\nIt just saw, well this isn't the most\nrecent version of it, so here is.\n\n336\n00:16:00.971 --> 00:16:05.330\nThe simple signature that you have\nedited and put in that website address.\n\n337\n00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:10.630\nLet's move over to business card before\nwe get into the fancier signature like\n\n338\n00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.610\nthe picture because a lot of people\nwanna put their pictures in there.\n\n339\n00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.100\nGet that to then, in just a second.\n\n340\n00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.590\nLet me jump over to the context.\n\n341\n00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:23.257\nI'm gonna close this out because I did\nwanna show you where that business card is\n\n342\n00:16:23.257 --> 00:16:23.923\ncoming from.\n\n343\n00:16:23.923 --> 00:16:27.860\nAnd while like I said,\nthis isn't the context area of our show.\n\n344\n00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:33.120\nWe have over here, I just realized,\nI don't think I have Joey as a contact.\n\n345\n00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.520\nSo I wouldn't be able to\nadd him as a business card.\n\n346\n00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.552\nSo you know what, instead of that, let's\njump over to JT, [LAUGH] cuz JT has one.\n\n347\n00:16:40.552 --> 00:16:45.050\nSo in his contacts, you could see that\nthere are some contacts in here for\n\n348\n00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:46.890\nLance and for Joey.\n\n349\n00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:51.110\nAnd there is a contact in\nJustin Timberlake's Outlook for\n\n350\n00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.100\nJustin Timberlake.\n\n351\n00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:56.090\nHe went ahead and created and\nput all of his work information, and\n\n352\n00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.200\nhis address, and links.\n\n353\n00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:03.030\nSo you create your own contact, you put\nin your own picture in your contact,\n\n354\n00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:06.240\nthis will become the business card.\n\n355\n00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.646\nJumping back over into our mail,\nI'm going to go to mail,\n\n356\n00:17:09.646 --> 00:17:13.340\nnew mail and go into signature cuz\nthis is always a place I go to.\n\n357\n00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:16.272\nI don't really go over in the options,\nfor some reason.\n\n358\n00:17:16.272 --> 00:17:18.610\nI don't know why, I just,\nthis is the way I go.\n\n359\n00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:20.800\nSo come in and do signatures.\n\n360\n00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.512\nI'm going to delete this one,\ncuz this is another thing.\n\n361\n00:17:23.512 --> 00:17:25.420\nI don't want this signature.\n\n362\n00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.880\nGo ahead and click on it and\nmake it go away.\n\n363\n00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.840\nNow it's gone, so\nI just have the simple and the fancy.\n\n364\n00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:36.216\nNow I'm gonna make a new one so\nyou can see how I did the business card.\n\n365\n00:17:36.216 --> 00:17:39.432\nAnd we'll say card, click OK.\n\n366\n00:17:39.432 --> 00:17:42.600\nHere is the named signature I want.\n\n367\n00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.380\nJust click the button,\nit's that simple and\n\n368\n00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.765\nthen that's I have to click which\ncard I'm gonna put in there.\n\n369\n00:17:47.765 --> 00:17:49.570\n[LAUGH] Sorry, forgot that extra step.\n\n370\n00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.394\n&gt;&gt; So you're just choosing a contact out\nof your contacts and it creates the card.\n\n371\n00:17:52.394 --> 00:17:56.415\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I don't think you'd really\nwanna put Joey Fatona as your signature in\n\n372\n00:17:56.415 --> 00:18:00.455\nJustin's email, but that's why you need\nto make sure you pick your contact.\n\n373\n00:18:00.455 --> 00:18:03.463\n&gt;&gt; Well, and this comes into play because\nyou might be connecting to different\n\n374\n00:18:03.463 --> 00:18:04.645\naddress books.\n\n375\n00:18:04.645 --> 00:18:09.134\nAnd you'll go, I want my contact from\nthis address book, so that's why it\n\n376\n00:18:09.134 --> 00:18:13.633\ngives you ability to choose, and not\njust go, well, you are you, here you go.\n\n377\n00:18:13.633 --> 00:18:15.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a great point, yes,\n\n378\n00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.190\ncuz you can have multiple\ncontacts in multiple places, and\n\n379\n00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.778\nyou have global addresses,\nyou have your own contacts.\n\n380\n00:18:21.778 --> 00:18:24.279\nYes, definitely different\nstorage places for\n\n381\n00:18:24.279 --> 00:18:26.664\ndifferent reasons of why\nyou are who you are.\n\n382\n00:18:26.664 --> 00:18:30.270\nClick OK here,\nthere's my business card, click OK.\n\n383\n00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:34.350\nAnd now any time that I\ninsert that signature card.\n\n384\n00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:35.530\nI named it card.\n\n385\n00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:37.880\nIt goes ahead and\nit puts it at the bottom.\n\n386\n00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.650\nAnd it always adds it as an attachment.\n\n387\n00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:44.680\nAnd these business cards,\nwhen you're sharing it this way, they work\n\n388\n00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:49.058\non not only everything in Outlook like\nExchange Servers, it goes past that.\n\n389\n00:18:49.058 --> 00:18:54.490\nGmail, cuz we send this to Chris over\non his Gmail account, works just fine.\n\n390\n00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.661\nAnd they can go ahead and click on it and\nput it into the contacts.\n\n391\n00:18:56.661 --> 00:19:00.630\nThat VCF, it's not Outlook specific.\n\n392\n00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.020\nIt's not a Microsoft specific format.\n\n393\n00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:08.310\nIt is a more universal for all platforms,\nfor all different types of mail servers.\n\n394\n00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.140\nAnd that's why it's nice because\nyou can start exchanging it.\n\n395\n00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.080\nAnd we will talk about\nsharing contacts and\n\n396\n00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.210\neverything when we get\ninto those episodes.\n\n397\n00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.960\nSo we've covered all of those.\n\n398\n00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.020\nWhere's my fancy signature?\n\n399\n00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:24.067\nThe easiest way to do a fancy,\nand when I say fancy,\n\n400\n00:19:24.067 --> 00:19:28.869\nis to create one with a picture and\nwith your alignment cuz you\n\n401\n00:19:28.869 --> 00:19:34.410\ndon't get these options in\nthe edit signature dialogue box.\n\n402\n00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.250\nThe easiest way to do it, and\nyou get a lot more options,\n\n403\n00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:41.820\nis to create the signature\nin a new message.\n\n404\n00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:48.580\nSelect it all, copy it, and\nthen paste it into the signature edit box.\n\n405\n00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.599\nSo that's what we're gonna do.\n\n406\n00:19:49.599 --> 00:19:50.567\nDan is over here going.\n\n407\n00:19:50.567 --> 00:19:53.493\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've done this before.\n\n408\n00:19:53.493 --> 00:19:57.759\n[LAUGH] I've had people go, how do I make\nthe cool Gliffy things with, you know,\n\n409\n00:19:57.759 --> 00:20:00.195\nthe rainbows and\nthe sparkles, I need that!\n\n410\n00:20:00.195 --> 00:20:02.863\nAnd I'm like, I don't think you\ncan just throw it in there.\n\n411\n00:20:02.863 --> 00:20:05.539\nAnd we had to go through the whole\nprocess and figure it out.\n\n412\n00:20:05.539 --> 00:20:09.745\nYou create a new email and put all\nthis stuff, cuz it's an HTML editor.\n\n413\n00:20:09.745 --> 00:20:10.445\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n414\n00:20:10.445 --> 00:20:12.875\n&gt;&gt; Chuck your stuff in there, copy it,\nand throw it in, and you're good to go.\n\n415\n00:20:12.875 --> 00:20:14.360\n&gt;&gt; Actually like, yeah!\n\n416\n00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:14.976\n&gt;&gt; It's like a blast from the past.\n\n417\n00:20:14.976 --> 00:20:18.405\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's all coming back to me now.\n\n418\n00:20:18.405 --> 00:20:19.765\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like waves of nostalgia.\n\n419\n00:20:19.765 --> 00:20:22.132\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You make me really wanna sing\n\n420\n00:20:22.132 --> 00:20:22.840\nright now.\n\n421\n00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.560\n[LAUGH] So we're going to say,\nthis is Joey Fatone.\n\n422\n00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.060\nI'm not putting in the picture first.\n\n423\n00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.630\nFrom experience, you put your text in\nfirst, and then you put your picture in.\n\n424\n00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:34.510\nIt's a little bit easier.\n\n425\n00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:38.367\nWhen you put your picture in from\nthe very first thing you do in Word,\n\n426\n00:20:38.367 --> 00:20:42.357\nit takes up space, and sometimes\nit's hard to get underneath it, and\n\n427\n00:20:42.357 --> 00:20:45.083\nmove it around, so\ntext first, picture last.\n\n428\n00:20:45.083 --> 00:20:51.240\nSo we'll say, Joey Fatone,\n555 Dance Shoes Lane.\n\n429\n00:20:52.255 --> 00:20:53.131\n&gt;&gt; He was on Dancing with the Stars.\n\n430\n00:20:53.131 --> 00:20:54.492\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He was.\n\n431\n00:20:54.492 --> 00:20:55.885\n&gt;&gt; He was, he was.\n\n432\n00:20:55.885 --> 00:21:00.038\nAnd we'll just say, New York, New York,\ncuz I can't think of anything else, right?\n\n433\n00:21:00.038 --> 00:21:01.134\nWhere's the Y?\n\n434\n00:21:01.134 --> 00:21:01.759\nThere it is.\n\n435\n00:21:01.759 --> 00:21:02.639\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's on the keyboard.\n\n436\n00:21:02.639 --> 00:21:07.049\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] 12345, and I could go ahead and\n\n437\n00:21:07.049 --> 00:21:08.475\nformat my text.\n\n438\n00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:10.935\nWe'll make this, well, we can go with red.\n\n439\n00:21:10.935 --> 00:21:13.905\nWe'll make it bold and\nwe'll make it a little bit bigger.\n\n440\n00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:17.780\nYou could put your website address and\nanything else that you would want into.\n\n441\n00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:20.270\nBut for times' sake,\nwe'll just leave it right here.\n\n442\n00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:21.620\nWanna put in my picture.\n\n443\n00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:26.690\nI'm gonna click back in front of the J,\nbecause I do want it off to the left.\n\n444\n00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.560\nWe'll insert, we'll put in a photo.\n\n445\n00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:35.034\nI do have a picture of Mr Joey,\n[LAUGH] and we will insert him there.\n\n446\n00:21:35.034 --> 00:21:39.516\n&gt;&gt; He's a little big, so I'll take my\ncorner, always grab from the corner so\n\n447\n00:21:39.516 --> 00:21:41.630\nit stays the-\n&gt;&gt; I love how it scales, yeah.\n\n448\n00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:44.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the, my gosh, aspect ratio.\n\n449\n00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.769\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It constrains the proportions,\n\n450\n00:21:45.769 --> 00:21:46.844\nthat's what I was trying to say.\n\n451\n00:21:46.844 --> 00:21:49.500\n[LAUGH] Move it on over here.\n\n452\n00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.090\nBecause I have the picture selected,\nI get my picture tools.\n\n453\n00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:56.442\nI could go ahead and format it, and\nmake it pretty, but what I really want is\n\n454\n00:21:56.442 --> 00:22:00.329\nthe wrap text of how I want the text\nto wrap around this photograph.\n\n455\n00:22:00.329 --> 00:22:01.930\nYou can choose square.\n\n456\n00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.906\nI'll probably go ahead and\npick square, and\n\n457\n00:22:04.906 --> 00:22:09.370\nmaybe make this a little bit smaller,\nso it kinda lines up.\n\n458\n00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.559\nOkay, I need to stop right now,\n\n459\n00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:12.732\nbecause I can start feeling\nmy designing stuff coming on.\n\n460\n00:22:12.732 --> 00:22:13.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's getting crazy.\n\n461\n00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:19.920\n&gt;&gt; Stop, got my signature or what's going\nto become my signature, ready to go.\n\n462\n00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.980\nYou can do a Ctrl+A for Select All.\n\n463\n00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:24.090\nYou could do click, hold, and\n\n464\n00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.650\ndrag, whichever way you wanna make\nsure you get everything selected.\n\n465\n00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:28.552\nAnd I'm going to copy.\n\n466\n00:22:28.552 --> 00:22:31.930\nI'm gonna click on this button up here so\nyou can see that I am copying,\n\n467\n00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:34.370\nbesides me just using\nmy keyboard shortcuts.\n\n468\n00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.280\nCopy this.\n\n469\n00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:42.660\nCome into signature, go to signatures,\nyou're gonna go ahead and make a new one.\n\n470\n00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.366\nWe'll name this Fancy.\n\n471\n00:22:44.366 --> 00:22:47.270\nI'm gonna say Fancy Pants\ncuz I want to say that.\n\n472\n00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:49.730\nI'm in my Fancy Pants signature.\n\n473\n00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:52.180\nClick down into the editor.\n\n474\n00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:57.740\nI am going to paste and I'm just,\nyou know I'm pasting, but\n\n475\n00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.670\nI'm just gonna go ahead and do Ctrl+V.\n\n476\n00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:00.260\nWhere's the picture?\n\n477\n00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:00.810\nWhere's the picture?\n\n478\n00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.080\nAnd this always freaks people out.\n\n479\n00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.315\nIt freaks me out, too.\n\n480\n00:23:03.315 --> 00:23:06.226\nCuz I know the picture's\nsupposed to be in there.\n\n481\n00:23:06.226 --> 00:23:07.260\nJust trust me.\n\n482\n00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.330\n&gt;&gt; It's there, right?\n\n483\n00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:09.150\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n484\n00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:13.994\nIt just doesn't want to show you so\nyou click Save, you click OK.\n\n485\n00:23:13.994 --> 00:23:16.860\nI'm going to close this message so\nwe don't get kind of, well,\n\n486\n00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:17.878\nit's already there.\n\n487\n00:23:17.878 --> 00:23:19.640\nI'm not saving any changes.\n\n488\n00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.951\nStarting from scratch, let's go, new mail.\n\n489\n00:23:23.951 --> 00:23:26.610\nYou know why this is happening?\n\n490\n00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:30.230\nIt set this as the default and\nI wasn't looking at it.\n\n491\n00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:32.280\n&gt;&gt; What are you gonna do?\n&gt;&gt; We'll come over and fix that.\n\n492\n00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.300\nCome over to Signature.\n\n493\n00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.490\nI'm going to see right there,\nnew messages, the first one, and\n\n494\n00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.520\nI think it does that by default.\n\n495\n00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.750\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, if you have a signature,\nit thinks you want to use a signature,\n\n496\n00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.070\nso it thinks, well,\nwe'll go with one by default.\n\n497\n00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:46.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we'll go ahead and\njump onto this side right here, and\n\n498\n00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:51.450\nsay I don't want it to have any\ndefault signature in my message body,\n\n499\n00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:53.240\nso I'm gonna go ahead and click None.\n\n500\n00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.910\n&gt;&gt; Click OK here.\n\n501\n00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:55.708\nMoment of truth.\n\n502\n00:23:55.708 --> 00:23:57.140\nDid the picture come over?\n\n503\n00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.990\nIt did.\n\n504\n00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.994\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so just a big note on that one,\n\n505\n00:24:01.994 --> 00:24:03.970\ntrust that it will work.\n\n506\n00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:07.920\nIt does come over, it's just that\nyou will never get it in the preview\n\n507\n00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.860\nof the edit signature dialogue box.\n\n508\n00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.950\nOnce you insert it, it will come on in.\n\n509\n00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:15.968\nAnd yes, kind of going back\nto those settings of hey,\n\n510\n00:24:15.968 --> 00:24:18.919\nI always want this to be\nthe signature that comes when\n\n511\n00:24:18.919 --> 00:24:23.100\nI make my first message that I want to\nsend to somebody or my business card.\n\n512\n00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:27.374\nBut then on all of my replies I just want\na smaller one that just has my name.\n\n513\n00:24:27.374 --> 00:24:31.090\nBecause it is always good to put\na signature like who is this from?\n\n514\n00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.487\nCuz I've gone back through some emails\nespecially if I'm going back and\n\n515\n00:24:34.487 --> 00:24:37.337\nforth to people and\nthey don't put their name at the bottom.\n\n516\n00:24:37.337 --> 00:24:39.642\nI get kind of confused.\n\n517\n00:24:39.642 --> 00:24:40.951\nWho said that?\n\n518\n00:24:40.951 --> 00:24:42.990\n&gt;&gt; It's just a real easy way to realize,\n\n519\n00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:46.060\nokay, this was the person\nwho sent this email.\n\n520\n00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.150\n&gt;&gt; Even if it's just sincerely,\nVonne Smith.\n\n521\n00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:50.460\nSomething very, very simple and\n\n522\n00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:55.870\njust make that the default of every\nmail whether it's new and/or forwarding.\n\n523\n00:24:55.870 --> 00:25:00.003\nThen people know that that is who\nI am receiving this message from.\n\n524\n00:25:00.003 --> 00:25:03.319\nSo I remember in elementary school we\nhad to do like the parts of a letter.\n\n525\n00:25:03.319 --> 00:25:05.520\n&gt;&gt; Learned how to type a letter,\nwrite a letter, yeah.\n\n526\n00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the address block and\nthe salutation.\n\n527\n00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.248\n&gt;&gt; Sincerely, your name and it was always,\nyou always ended a letter that way.\n\n528\n00:25:12.248 --> 00:25:14.370\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes.\n\n529\n00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:15.960\nI wonder if they still\nteach that in school?\n\n530\n00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.514\nCuz I mean, we were writing this out.\n\n531\n00:25:16.514 --> 00:25:20.067\n&gt;&gt; I hope so, but nowadays they tell\nyou not even to write stuff anymore.\n\n532\n00:25:20.067 --> 00:25:20.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\n[LAUGH]\n\n533\n00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:21.470\n&gt;&gt; Who'd get rid of a written language?\n\n534\n00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:22.314\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n535\n00:25:22.314 --> 00:25:23.463\nlet's just go ahead and text each other.\n\n536\n00:25:23.463 --> 00:25:24.852\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's all text, here's an emoji for ya.\n\n537\n00:25:24.852 --> 00:25:27.836\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're veering, so we should come back.\n\n538\n00:25:27.836 --> 00:25:29.796\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're starting to digress.\n\n539\n00:25:29.796 --> 00:25:34.387\n&gt;&gt; Just go ahead and set those different\ndefaults by coming into our signatures.\n\n540\n00:25:34.387 --> 00:25:35.920\nWhat do I want?\n\n541\n00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.070\nWhat signature do I want for\nmy new message?\n\n542\n00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.660\nWhat signature do I want for my replies?\n\n543\n00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:44.981\nAnd if you're managing multiple accounts,\nif I had multiple inboxes in here,\n\n544\n00:25:44.981 --> 00:25:47.883\nyou could just go ahead and\nset it up for each account,\n\n545\n00:25:47.883 --> 00:25:51.707\nwould have different signatures,\nand different default settings.\n\n546\n00:25:51.707 --> 00:25:56.606\nSo I think that is everything that I can\nthink of, honestly, about signatures, and\n\n547\n00:25:56.606 --> 00:26:01.305\nnow you know to go ahead and put your\nlittle, no, salutation's the beginning.\n\n548\n00:26:01.305 --> 00:26:04.027\nYour closing,\nclose every message with a signature.\n\n549\n00:26:04.027 --> 00:26:05.068\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Vonne,\n\n550\n00:26:05.068 --> 00:26:07.680\nyou have made us all signature masters,\nat least hopefully.\n\n551\n00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.600\nI know that was your goal and\n\n552\n00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.820\nI think you did a great job of walking us\nthrough each of the individual steps that\n\n553\n00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:16.100\nwe can go through to make a very\neffective signature for us.\n\n554\n00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.163\nThat being said, Vonne, I'm looking at\nour clock and we have run out of time for\n\n555\n00:26:19.163 --> 00:26:19.773\nthis episode.\n\n556\n00:26:19.773 --> 00:26:20.701\nWe do thank you for joining us.\n\n557\n00:26:20.701 --> 00:26:22.925\nWe thank you good folks out there for\nwatching.\n\n558\n00:26:22.925 --> 00:26:26.190\nSigning off for Office ProTV,\nI've been your host,

OfficeProTV,\n\n3\n00:00:10.271 --> 00:00:13.260\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, well,\n\n4\n00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.345\nwe are continuing on with more\non our Outlook 2016 series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:19.740\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio\nto light up our lives, our good friend,\n\n6\n00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.490\nMs Vonne Smith, Vonne, we're so glad\nto have you back, how's it going today?\n\n7\n00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.793\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, it's going great,\ntoday we are going to organize,\n\n8\n00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:29.671\ncustomize, and search, my [LAUGH].\n\n9\n00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:31.597\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It sounded like a cheer.\n\n10\n00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:36.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like the whole organize,\ncustomize, and search.\n\n11\n00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.240\nJust really rolls of the tongue?\n\n12\n00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.948\n&gt;&gt; I really wanna keep saying it but\nwe should probably go ahead with just-\n\n13\n00:00:39.948 --> 00:00:42.071\n&gt;&gt; Order some pom-poms here in a second.\n\n14\n00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:42.701\n&gt;&gt; Don't get me started.\n\n15\n00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:45.326\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n16\n00:00:45.326 --> 00:00:49.711\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go over all the different\nthings to try to just keep you in check\n\n17\n00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:53.123\nwhen you are using Outlook\nbecause this is your day planner\n\n18\n00:00:53.123 --> 00:00:55.718\nthat we talked about\nin the very beginning.\n\n19\n00:00:55.718 --> 00:01:01.758\nThe things that will get you through your\nday and everything in your business and\n\n20\n00:01:01.758 --> 00:01:07.840\nin your office and emails, contacts,\ntasks, how do I keep myself organized?\n\n21\n00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.396\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and show you\nsome different things that you can do in\n\n22\n00:01:11.396 --> 00:01:16.040\nOutlook, so jump down into the computer,\nI'm Joey and\n\n23\n00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.140\nin this episode, so\nwe are gonna stay in Joey's inbox.\n\n24\n00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.410\nSome of the things that we are going to\ncover is gonna be a little bit of a review\n\n25\n00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.720\nif you have seen the other episodes.\n\n26\n00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.237\nBut I just wanna gloss over them\na little bit, not necessarily gloss, but\n\n27\n00:01:30.237 --> 00:01:34.115\njust review them, like I've already said,\nso you get what I'm talking about.\n\n28\n00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:38.918\nOne of the first things we can\ndo is Show as conversations,\n\n29\n00:01:38.918 --> 00:01:44.222\nJoey's inbox is showing as conversations,\ndid I turn it back?\n\n30\n00:01:44.222 --> 00:01:50.393\nNo it's not showing as conversations,\n\n31\n00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:54.260\nJT was showing as conversations.\n\n32\n00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.300\nGoing back and forth a little bit but\nthat is something nice that I did this for\n\n33\n00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.220\na review of, why would you\nwanna show those conversations?\n\n34\n00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.490\nWell, it keeps it organized to me\nas to we went back and forth, and\n\n35\n00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.020\nit also shows me right in the inbox\nwhen I have sent something.\n\n36\n00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.729\nSo i really like to see that and\nthe whole conversation,\n\n37\n00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:18.860\nso I'm gonna click on that check box and\nit is going to prompt me,\n\n38\n00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.380\ndo I want to do it for\nthis particular folder, or all mailboxes?\n\n39\n00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.276\nI'm only in the inbox, All mailboxes\nwould be Drafts, Sent, your Junk mail,\n\n40\n00:02:28.276 --> 00:02:33.827\nI wanna keep those separate but if you\nwanted to do that option, you could.\n\n41\n00:02:33.827 --> 00:02:36.794\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nclick on this folder and\n\n42\n00:02:36.794 --> 00:02:41.150\nI can see that now I have some\nconversations here, especially right here.\n\n43\n00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.470\nThis is the signature from\nJustin Timberlake, it went back and\n\n44\n00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.660\nforth a couple times and I can go ahead\nand click the little drop down to see that\n\n45\n00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.130\nJustin sent it, I responded as Joey.\n\n46\n00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.890\nSo you can see that that says Sent\nover there and it is italicized, and\n\n47\n00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.780\nthen Justin said something back to me and\nthen Justin said something back\n\n48\n00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.140\nto me again because I missed\nsomething over in JT's inbox.\n\n49\n00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.570\nSo I like to Show as conversations,\n\n50\n00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.700\nthat's one way that we can go ahead and\nkeep organized.\n\n51\n00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.797\nAll of these emails right now in my\ninbox are marked as that I've read them,\n\n52\n00:03:18.797 --> 00:03:20.350\nI've clicked on them.\n\n53\n00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.766\nThe reason I've read them though is\nbecause I also have the reading paint over\n\n54\n00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:31.620\nhere on the right, set by default, to mark\nit as Read after I've clicked off of it.\n\n55\n00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.890\nBut this is another way that I like\nto try to keep myself organised,\n\n56\n00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.610\nis, let me go ahead and\nmark it as unread again.\n\n57\n00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.147\nSo when I come back in it's bold,\nI get those visual indications,\n\n58\n00:03:44.147 --> 00:03:49.171\nthat you need to pay attention to this,\nso if I wanted to mark that Lance's\n\n59\n00:03:49.171 --> 00:03:53.895\ntour bus talk and this meeting\nrequest that I have received from him.\n\n60\n00:03:53.895 --> 00:03:57.897\nI haven't followed up with it just set,\nmarker is on Read,\n\n61\n00:03:57.897 --> 00:04:02.810\nI right-click to get to him and\nthen I can mark right here as Unread.\n\n62\n00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.801\nIt takes it back to where\nit is that bold and\n\n63\n00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:10.940\nthere's that indication in my inbox\nalso shows me the number one here.\n\n64\n00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.155\nBut about that reading pane,\n\n65\n00:04:13.155 --> 00:04:17.951\nmaybe I don't want the reading\npane to be treated as being read.\n\n66\n00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:19.930\nCuz sometimes I'm just clicking\nback up through the emails and\n\n67\n00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.434\nI'm not really paying\nattention to anything.\n\n68\n00:04:21.434 --> 00:04:24.918\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you wanna change that default\noption to where it says, yeah, if you look\n\n69\n00:04:24.918 --> 00:04:28.230\nat this email at all I'm just going to\ngo ahead and mark it as you read it.\n\n70\n00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.288\nEven though a lot of the times you're\njust scrolling through your inbox, and\n\n71\n00:04:31.288 --> 00:04:34.674\nyou click on something, and it says,\nyeah, he read that, no, I didn't read it,\n\n72\n00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:35.918\nI just happened to click on it.\n\n73\n00:04:35.918 --> 00:04:40.436\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the way that I could\nmake sure that I can either mark it\n\n74\n00:04:40.436 --> 00:04:44.526\nmanually as I have read this,\nor if I double click on it and\n\n75\n00:04:44.526 --> 00:04:50.310\nactually open up the message,\nthen that's okay, I have read this email.\n\n76\n00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.468\nYou can change that reading pane setting\nif you go over into your options,\n\n77\n00:04:54.468 --> 00:04:57.216\nif you go over the file and\nthen you go to options,\n\n78\n00:04:57.216 --> 00:05:00.255\nI wanna make sure it's in\nthe right place in the mail.\n\n79\n00:05:00.255 --> 00:05:05.358\nAnd then if we scroll on down into, no,\n\n80\n00:05:05.358 --> 00:05:12.637\nit's not there, I wrote it down,\nthere it is [LAUGH].\n\n81\n00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.909\n&gt;&gt; Well, it says, Options, Mail, Reading\npane, and I'm looking for, I was like,\n\n82\n00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:18.294\nthat doesn't say Reading Pane [LAUGH].\n\n83\n00:05:18.294 --> 00:05:19.250\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n84\n00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.671\nSo I probably should have put Compose\nmessage, and then Reading pane,\n\n85\n00:05:23.671 --> 00:05:26.763\nI need to make a note to check that,\nin your notes so\n\n86\n00:05:26.763 --> 00:05:30.540\nwhen you watch, or\nlook at them you have the right one.\n\n87\n00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.800\nSo I'm gonna come over to Reading pane,\ncustomize how items are marked as read,\n\n88\n00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.580\nthat's where I wanna go,\nI want to turn off here,\n\n89\n00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.640\nmark item as red when selection changes.\n\n90\n00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.170\nAnd that's where I'm selecting\nmy messages in my inbox,\n\n91\n00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.220\nyou uncheck that and\nit will stop doing that.\n\n92\n00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.500\nSo that is a setting that I\nwould suggest doing to keep\n\n93\n00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.410\nyourself a little bit more organized.\n\n94\n00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.300\nSome of the other things you\ncan do to keep you organized,\n\n95\n00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.990\nI'm a big color coder person,\nI put sticky notes on everything.\n\n96\n00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.270\nMy pink sticky notes mean something\ndifferent than my blue sticky notes,\n\n97\n00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.802\nthen and my yellow sticky notes,\nthey mean something to me.\n\n98\n00:06:10.802 --> 00:06:14.413\n[LAUGH] I don't actually remember\nwhich one's are which right now.\n\n99\n00:06:14.413 --> 00:06:15.837\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be different on any given\nday but it means something to you.\n\n100\n00:06:15.837 --> 00:06:20.458\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I'm still getting into\nmy own flow of what they actually\n\n101\n00:06:20.458 --> 00:06:24.004\nmean just right now, but\nback at my old job, yeah,\n\n102\n00:06:24.004 --> 00:06:28.170\nthe sticky notes actually\nmeant something for real.\n\n103\n00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.630\nSo you could go ahead and\nput categories on your e-mails,\n\n104\n00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.540\nnow categories expand across\neverything in Outlook.\n\n105\n00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.740\nIt's not just an e-mail, you could\ncategorize or tag if you wanna say,\n\n106\n00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.200\na contact, you could tag a task,\nyou could tag a meeting,\n\n107\n00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.340\nand that's where you have to know\nthat the orange tags mean something.\n\n108\n00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.920\nMaybe orange tags are your\nmarketing projects and\n\n109\n00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.730\nthe blue tags are categories,\nthose are your HR categories.\n\n110\n00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.460\nYou set what the colors mean and\nyou can go ahead and\n\n111\n00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.480\nset the names of those categories as well,\nso\n\n112\n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.080\nhow do I add a category to an email?\n\n113\n00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.740\nMaybe we'll go with, here,\nLance, this thanks email,\n\n114\n00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.080\nmaybe we'll go with this one instead,\nwe'll go with Lance and the redirect Joey.\n\n115\n00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.810\nI want to categorize this as green, you\n\n116\n00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:31.270\ncome over to your home tab and\non the home tab right there is Categorize.\n\n117\n00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:35.250\nI believe you can also right-click and\nyou can categorize as well,\n\n118\n00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.200\nso either way you wanna go,\ndid I say green?\n\n119\n00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:38.980\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay well,\n\n120\n00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.010\nso we'll go with green,\nanything from Lance is green, and\n\n121\n00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:47.323\nLance is associated with\nthe green category [LAUGH].\n\n122\n00:07:47.323 --> 00:07:49.942\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just totally lost it there, so\n\n123\n00:07:49.942 --> 00:07:54.380\nwe're gonna go and say the Green\ncategory and it has been applied,\n\n124\n00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.756\nnow if you have never used a category\nbefore, it will prompt you.\n\n125\n00:07:58.756 --> 00:08:02.281\nAnd the very first time you use it,\nit's saying hey, so\n\n126\n00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:07.460\nyou really haven't used this before, do\nyou know what you want to say about this?\n\n127\n00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.700\nSo maybe we'll go with this business\ncard from Justin Timberlake.\n\n128\n00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.293\nThis is going to be categorized in the,\nI don't know if I've used yellow before,\n\n129\n00:08:14.293 --> 00:08:14.875\nthere we go.\n\n130\n00:08:14.875 --> 00:08:18.747\nSo yellow, this is the first time,\ndo you wanna rename it, so\n\n131\n00:08:18.747 --> 00:08:21.840\nit's not just saying yellow category?\n\n132\n00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.843\nMaybe we could say that this\nis associated with the band.\n\n133\n00:08:24.843 --> 00:08:29.310\nAnd so anything that's associated with\nthe band is going to be colored yellow.\n\n134\n00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.560\nAnd if you don't like yellow, you could go\nahead and choose all these other colors.\n\n135\n00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.835\nMaybe some pinks in there and\n\n136\n00:08:33.835 --> 00:08:35.840\nsome purples-\n&gt;&gt; Chartreuse.\n\n137\n00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.940\n&gt;&gt; Chartreuse, I love a chartreuse.\n\n138\n00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.840\nSo we're [LAUGH] gonna keep the yellow.\n\n139\n00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.778\nSay yes, and now I've started to catalog,\nor categorize, our different things.\n\n140\n00:08:45.778 --> 00:08:53.058\nLet's say maybe this is yellow as well,\nand maybe this one is going to be yellow.\n\n141\n00:08:53.058 --> 00:08:56.970\nI'm just getting a couple of different\nthings in there that have that category,\n\n142\n00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.400\nbecause why would you wanna\nkeep it as a category?\n\n143\n00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.920\nBecause if you attach it with a category,\nwe get into searching.\n\n144\n00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.651\nYou could use that as one of your\ncriterias of what you are looking for.\n\n145\n00:09:06.651 --> 00:09:09.938\nI know it's banned, and\nI know I marked it.\n\n146\n00:09:09.938 --> 00:09:14.530\nSo show me everything that\nhas a category of yellow.\n\n147\n00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:19.135\nAnd again,\ncrosses over to all items in Outlook.\n\n148\n00:09:19.135 --> 00:09:23.742\nAnother thing that you could do to give\nyou some more visual indications of hey,\n\n149\n00:09:23.742 --> 00:09:25.250\nyou know what?\n\n150\n00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.300\nI need to make sure that\nI don't forget this.\n\n151\n00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:32.750\nAnd this is a system that I implemented\na lot when I was back at the university.\n\n152\n00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:38.140\nIt's flagging my emails that I\nneed to follow up with this.\n\n153\n00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:44.770\nSo maybe this one here, my Lance tour bus,\nI definitely need to not forget this.\n\n154\n00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:48.224\nJust click the little red flag\nthat's off to the right hand side.\n\n155\n00:09:48.224 --> 00:09:51.660\n&gt;&gt; I remember I used to do flagging, and\nthere would be on the right hand pane\n\n156\n00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.950\nnext to the reading pane, it would give me\na list of all the ones that I had flagged.\n\n157\n00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.550\nSo I could just easily and\nquickly reference those.\n\n158\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.510\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nthat's how we can customize our views.\n\n159\n00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:07.400\nSo while we're talking about it, it's the\nview, and it's your to do bar over here.\n\n160\n00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.770\nAnd so you can go ahead and\ngo to your tasks, and those are the ones.\n\n161\n00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.960\nAnd because the flags are not\njust like a follow up for\n\n162\n00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.570\nyou in email, it is associated with tasks.\n\n163\n00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.400\nTasks are a specific\nplace in Outlook that,\n\n164\n00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.470\nwell, they're tasks that you have to do,\nand that's why they call it a to do list.\n\n165\n00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.719\nAnd then all of these\nemails that are here,\n\n166\n00:10:28.719 --> 00:10:32.000\nthat these are the ones\nthat I've already flagged.\n\n167\n00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.950\nNow right now,\nLance's email about the tour bus talk,\n\n168\n00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.740\nit's not showing anything but\nthe red flag off to the right.\n\n169\n00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:44.020\nIf I scroll down to some other emails,\nlike right here,\n\n170\n00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.200\nI flagged this one a while ago, and\nlook at what color it is, it's red.\n\n171\n00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.340\nSo I know that if I'm going through\nmy inbox and I see red emails,\n\n172\n00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.430\nthat's something that I have marked\nas you need to follow up with this.\n\n173\n00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:58.353\nAnd so okay,\n\n174\n00:10:58.353 --> 00:11:02.140\nI need to make sure that Lance is\ngoing to be followed up with this.\n\n175\n00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.230\nThis is everyone in the to field,\n\n176\n00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:07.160\nthis is when we're going back and\nforth with creating our messages.\n\n177\n00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.650\nLet's say I did this,\nmaybe he wanted me to water his plants or\n\n178\n00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.320\nsomething like that.\n\n179\n00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.692\nSo I went ahead and did that.\n\n180\n00:11:12.692 --> 00:11:16.162\nI wanna check this off as being completed,\nclick on it.\n\n181\n00:11:16.162 --> 00:11:19.226\nAnd now that has become\na little green checkmark.\n\n182\n00:11:19.226 --> 00:11:20.714\nSo it's a nice, like,\nI've done it and notice-\n\n183\n00:11:20.714 --> 00:11:21.370\n&gt;&gt; It's a checklist.\n\n184\n00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.002\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's exactly what a checklist is.\n\n185\n00:11:23.002 --> 00:11:24.481\nAt least, well, it is a checklist.\n\n186\n00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:25.637\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is a checklist,\n\n187\n00:11:25.637 --> 00:11:26.466\nliterally a checklist.\n\n188\n00:11:26.466 --> 00:11:29.501\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's literally a checklist, and\n\n189\n00:11:29.501 --> 00:11:34.102\nit has come off of my to do pane over\nhere on the right hand side that\n\n190\n00:11:34.102 --> 00:11:37.695\nI was using in my view\nwhile customizing our view.\n\n191\n00:11:37.695 --> 00:11:41.025\nAnd we'll turn that off,\ncome back over to home.\n\n192\n00:11:41.025 --> 00:11:43.331\nAnd so those are some\ndifferent things you can do.\n\n193\n00:11:43.331 --> 00:11:46.551\nThe other things I would suggest is make\nsure that you're always checking your\n\n194\n00:11:46.551 --> 00:11:47.248\ndrafts folder.\n\n195\n00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:49.845\nYour drafts folder are the ones\nthat you're using as,\n\n196\n00:11:49.845 --> 00:11:51.715\nwhether you're saving it on purpose.\n\n197\n00:11:51.715 --> 00:11:55.764\nAnd we talked about that auto-saving in\nsome of our other episodes of where I've\n\n198\n00:11:55.764 --> 00:11:59.218\nactually come back to my draft folder\nmaybe like every couple weeks,\n\n199\n00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:02.360\nand there's a whole bunch of\nemails that are just blank.\n\n200\n00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.380\nBlank, blank, blank, blank, blank because\nit just auto-saved, and it just was like,\n\n201\n00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.500\nI'm leaving for the day, close, close,\nclose, close, close, close, close.\n\n202\n00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.000\nAnd I've got all this stuff just\nhanging out in my drafts folder.\n\n203\n00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.250\nSo come in here, clean it up,\ndelete the ones that you need to delete.\n\n204\n00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:20.140\nAnother thing to keep you organized,\nmake sure you go and delete your trash,\n\n205\n00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.900\nyour deleted items.\n\n206\n00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.420\nBecause we talked about that,\nonce you delete something,\n\n207\n00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.220\nit doesn't actually delete delete.\n\n208\n00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.620\nIt's still kinda hanging\nout in the trash can.\n\n209\n00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.580\nThis will also help you with space,\nkeeping you organized that way.\n\n210\n00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.170\nSo, emptying your trash can here, and\n\n211\n00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:40.090\nthen this is permanently deleting it,\nthat will help you keep organized and\n\n212\n00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.120\neven just organized more for,\nlike I said, mailbox size.\n\n213\n00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.930\nYou could also use\nwhat's known as cleanup.\n\n214\n00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.162\nNow cleaning up is just\nwhat it sounds like.\n\n215\n00:12:50.162 --> 00:12:54.975\nIt's gonna clean up your inbox,\nor clean up a conversation.\n\n216\n00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:58.970\nCleanup is used to where maybe\nyou have a conversation, so\n\n217\n00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.920\nyou need to have things\nshown as a conversation.\n\n218\n00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.618\nAnd there's a bunch of back and\nforths, and maybe a couple people have\n\n219\n00:13:04.618 --> 00:13:07.286\nbeen talking back and forth that\ndon't have anything to do with you.\n\n220\n00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:12.920\nAnd you don't really want that, then\nOutlook will come and clean it up for you.\n\n221\n00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.380\nThe only think about this is,\nit's doing it automatically.\n\n222\n00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.370\nIt's determining what it\nthinks it needs to clean up.\n\n223\n00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.330\n&gt;&gt; Probably gonna not employ that feature.\n\n224\n00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.290\n&gt;&gt; You know-\n&gt;&gt; Not for myself, personally.\n\n225\n00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:27.040\n&gt;&gt; I personally wouldn't either,\nbut you could.\n\n226\n00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.840\nThe nice thing is,\nis when you go ahead and clean up,\n\n227\n00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.900\nyou can designate what\nfolder it goes into.\n\n228\n00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and that's a little better.\n\n229\n00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nit's not like it's deleting it.\n\n230\n00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.190\nIt's gonna say,\n\n231\n00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.830\nhey, I'm gonna move all this stuff\nthat I think is junk or clutter.\n\n232\n00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.660\nWe talked about that with the focus inbox.\n\n233\n00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.210\nSo, it's gonna move it in, and\n\n234\n00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.950\nthen I could look at that folder and\ndetermine mm, nope.\n\n235\n00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.290\nYou gotta go back in, and\nthen you know what, this is pretty good.\n\n236\n00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:51.900\nNow I'll go ahead and delete all of these.\n\n237\n00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.600\nSo, you could go ahead and designate that.\n\n238\n00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.880\nWhere is the cleanup?\n\n239\n00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.600\nIt's right in here.\n\n240\n00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.480\nAnd because my ribbon is a little smaller,\nit doesn't say cleanup next to it.\n\n241\n00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.240\nNow notice it say clean up conversation.\n\n242\n00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:10.730\nIf I was selected on a conversation, then\nit would just go with that particular one.\n\n243\n00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.826\nIf I said clean up folder,\nthat means my entire inbox.\n\n244\n00:14:13.826 --> 00:14:19.030\nAnd then, clean up folder or in sub\nfolders, if I have folders off my inbox,\n\n245\n00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.590\nwhich we will get to in just a second,\nyou could go ahead and\n\n246\n00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.350\ndesignate what you're cleaning up.\n\n247\n00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:26.227\nYou know what, we'll just go here.\n\n248\n00:14:26.227 --> 00:14:28.531\nAnd I didn't really need to\nmove to a different email.\n\n249\n00:14:28.531 --> 00:14:33.270\n[LAUGH] Cuz I'm going to\nuse the cleanup folder.\n\n250\n00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.710\nNow, watch what happens when I do this.\n\n251\n00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:35.210\nIt's saying hey,\n\n252\n00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:39.980\nall redundant messages in the current\nfolder will be moved to the deleted items.\n\n253\n00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.150\nI don't know if I wanna mix\nit all in the deleted items,\n\n254\n00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.790\nbecause I'm gonna have deleted\nitems from the whole week.\n\n255\n00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.400\nYou can change this with your settings.\n\n256\n00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.667\nSo, on the left hand side of this dialog\nbox, you can come in to your cleanup, and\n\n257\n00:14:53.667 --> 00:14:59.258\nyou come down in here, in the conversation\ncleanup, they will go into which folder?\n\n258\n00:14:59.258 --> 00:15:04.828\nThis first item,\nI can browse and set a folder.\n\n259\n00:15:04.828 --> 00:15:06.908\nNow, all of these folders right here,\n\n260\n00:15:06.908 --> 00:15:10.680\nthey're the default ones\nthat come with the program.\n\n261\n00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.810\nI don't wanna put in deleted,\nso I'm gonna make a new folder.\n\n262\n00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:21.159\nI want a new place for it to go,\nand I will name it clean up stuff.\n\n263\n00:15:21.159 --> 00:15:26.730\nRight now, it is going to make it\noff of the deleted items folder.\n\n264\n00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.027\nIt's gonna be a folder within a folder,\n\n265\n00:15:28.027 --> 00:15:29.793\nwhich we're going to get to\nin just a second, as well.\n\n266\n00:15:29.793 --> 00:15:34.500\nIt's another way that we can keep\nourselves organized, start making folders.\n\n267\n00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:39.364\nSo I'll keep it there, but you could put\nit anywhere, you could put it off of\n\n268\n00:15:39.364 --> 00:15:44.014\nyour main email box, you could put it\noff of the inbox, if you wanted to.\n\n269\n00:15:44.014 --> 00:15:48.888\nSince this is a cleanup, I just think\nit kind of is trying to clean up, so\n\n270\n00:15:48.888 --> 00:15:52.953\nI might as well go ahead and\nbe in the deleted items already,\n\n271\n00:15:52.953 --> 00:15:55.659\njust as a subfolder, a subset of that.\n\n272\n00:15:55.659 --> 00:15:57.578\nClick OK.\n\n273\n00:15:57.578 --> 00:15:58.876\nThat's where it's going to go.\n\n274\n00:15:58.876 --> 00:16:01.964\nClick OK again.\n\n275\n00:16:01.964 --> 00:16:04.596\nAnd notice by the way this should\ntake you into the Outlook options.\n\n276\n00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:09.488\nSo I could have gotten to that way,\ngone to this first, set my folder up,\n\n277\n00:16:09.488 --> 00:16:12.070\nand then clicked the clean up button.\n\n278\n00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.601\nClick OK here, I do want you to\nclean up this folder Outlook.\n\n279\n00:16:15.601 --> 00:16:17.990\nAnd now let's go see what it did.\n\n280\n00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.481\nWe'll come into the little what is this?\n\n281\n00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:23.690\nThe collapsible button, the expand button.\n\n282\n00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.479\nI think that's what they're called,\nI'm gonna call it that.\n\n283\n00:16:26.479 --> 00:16:31.277\nSo if I expand out the deleted items,\nI have my subfolder into here and\n\n284\n00:16:31.277 --> 00:16:34.510\nall right, it took the signature.\n\n285\n00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.822\nAnd it took the reunion tour, but\nthe reunion tour's so important.\n\n286\n00:16:37.822 --> 00:16:40.042\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n287\n00:16:40.042 --> 00:16:41.912\n&gt;&gt; So I really hope they do that.\n\n288\n00:16:41.912 --> 00:16:44.770\n&gt;&gt; I can see why it probably did that,\ncuz it was just a reply, like let's do it.\n\n289\n00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.960\nIt wasn't anything pertinent information.\n\n290\n00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.830\nAnd I'm guess the algorithm\nthat runs through this said,\n\n291\n00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:54.440\nthat doesn't seem like it's insane amounts\nof information, probably unnecessary.\n\n292\n00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.260\n&gt;&gt; And that makes sense to me.\n\n293\n00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.134\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So I guess it makes sense in\n\n294\n00:16:57.134 --> 00:16:58.086\nOutlook-\n&gt;&gt; Brain.\n\n295\n00:16:58.086 --> 00:17:02.298\n&gt;&gt; Brain two. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you can see that it's subdividing\n\n296\n00:17:02.298 --> 00:17:05.545\nall of my messages, and\nputting it into this clean up.\n\n297\n00:17:05.545 --> 00:17:09.703\nSo try it out, maybe you don't like it\nto determine what it needs to clean or\n\n298\n00:17:09.703 --> 00:17:10.370\nnot clean.\n\n299\n00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:14.174\nBut at least it does give you\nthe option of putting it somewhere, and\n\n300\n00:17:14.174 --> 00:17:16.020\nyou can go back and look at it.\n\n301\n00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.914\n&gt;&gt; And we got the chance to\nanthropomorphize Outlook.\n\n302\n00:17:17.914 --> 00:17:18.454\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n303\n00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:19.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n304\n00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.671\n&gt;&gt; Word of the day everyone,\n\n305\n00:17:21.671 --> 00:17:23.210\nword of the day.\n\n306\n00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.983\n&gt;&gt; Anthropomorphize.\n\n307\n00:17:23.983 --> 00:17:26.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't even think I can say that.\n\n308\n00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.006\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It means we give it human qualities\n\n309\n00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:30.400\neven though it's not a human.\n\n310\n00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.606\n&gt;&gt; I like that word better.\n\n311\n00:17:31.606 --> 00:17:32.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n312\n00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.702\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's combine lots\n\n313\n00:17:33.702 --> 00:17:34.607\nof words, right?\n\n314\n00:17:34.607 --> 00:17:36.130\n[LAUGH] Perfect, yes.\n\n315\n00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.151\nWe did what Daniel said, we just did.\n\n316\n00:17:38.151 --> 00:17:41.516\n[LAUGH] I'm not even gonna try again.\n\n317\n00:17:41.516 --> 00:17:44.157\n&gt;&gt; That's funny,\nlet's use that [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n\n318\n00:17:44.157 --> 00:17:46.964\n&gt;&gt; So we started going into with the clean\n\n319\n00:17:46.964 --> 00:17:51.623\nup that we made a folder,\na subfolder, off the deleted items.\n\n320\n00:17:51.623 --> 00:17:55.969\nSo that's like I said, another way\nthat we could keep ourself organized.\n\n321\n00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:00.500\nYou could use this however\nmuch that you want to.\n\n322\n00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:06.430\nI know a good friend of mine, she uses\nfolders like nobody's business and\n\n323\n00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.530\neverything gets put\nsomewhere into a folder.\n\n324\n00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.725\nEmail comes in, she moves it, and\n\n325\n00:18:11.725 --> 00:18:16.971\nwe'll also talk about next episode about\nmaking rules designed automatically.\n\n326\n00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:19.550\nRight now we're going to talk\nabout doing it manually.\n\n327\n00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:22.473\nBecause may be I have a LANs folder or\n\n328\n00:18:22.473 --> 00:18:27.253\nI have a reunion tour folder,\nand I have a tour bus folder.\n\n329\n00:18:27.253 --> 00:18:31.077\nBecause anything that is\nassociated with these projects or\n\n330\n00:18:31.077 --> 00:18:35.900\nthese kinda high level topics,\nI wanna be able to put them in there.\n\n331\n00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.669\nJust like we have drawers of file\nfolders and we have all the little tabs.\n\n332\n00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:43.578\nAnd they're marked taxes 2015, 2016,\n2017, I'm just thinking my own.\n\n333\n00:18:43.578 --> 00:18:44.428\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah.\n\n346\n00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.655\n&gt;&gt; I have a Vonne Smith folder, so\n\n347\n00:19:12.655 --> 00:19:16.353\nwhen Vonne sends me something, I drop it\nor I create a rule, so it will do that for\n\n348\n00:19:16.353 --> 00:19:18.167\nme.\n&gt;&gt; We were just talking about\n\n349\n00:19:18.167 --> 00:19:20.467\nthis before the episode, our Fox MS.\n\n350\n00:19:20.467 --> 00:19:21.244\n&gt;&gt; OMS.\n&gt;&gt; OMS-\n\n351\n00:19:21.244 --> 00:19:21.844\n&gt;&gt;

great, glad to be back for\nOrganize, Customize, and Search.\n\n13\n00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:36.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I just love that.\n\n14\n00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.490\nI really wanna cheer it out.\n\n15\n00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.650\n&gt;&gt; Man, I'm telling you.\n\n16\n00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So yes, we are back for Part 2.\n\n17\n00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.270\nWe had talked about the different\nways we can organize ourselves.\n\n18\n00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.020\nNow we're gonna move on to\nthe customize and search.\n\n19\n00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.090\nJump right in, let's get started.\n\n20\n00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.530\n&gt;&gt; Hit the ground running.\n\n21\n00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.230\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and we have done some of\nthese things in our other episodes.\n\n22\n00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.120\nAnd actually, in our Part 1,\n\n23\n00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.910\nyou talked about the To Do list\nover on the right hand side.\n\n24\n00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.720\nI remember that that was over there and\n\n25\n00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.650\nthat is a customization that\nwe can do in our views.\n\n26\n00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.510\nWe also talked about this a lot\nin our Outlook interface.\n\n27\n00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.950\nSo let's just go and\nreview really quickly.\n\n28\n00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.470\nOn the View tab, these buttons\nover onto the right hand side.\n\n29\n00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.910\nThe folder pane is off to the left, and\n\n30\n00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.400\nthat is where you want to\nkeep it either normal.\n\n31\n00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.490\nI like it as normal.\n\n32\n00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.650\nI don't want to really keep it as\nminimized cuz then I don't see\n\n33\n00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.440\nall of the folders and it's just not\nthe way that I'm used to seeing it.\n\n34\n00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.250\nBut if you wanted to,\nyou're more than welcome to do that.\n\n35\n00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.730\nI'm gonna put that back over here.\n\n36\n00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.950\nThe reading pane is the one on the right.\n\n37\n00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.490\nIf you wanted to keep that,\nit's the default setting so\n\n38\n00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.900\nI've got used to that way.\n\n39\n00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.530\nBut maybe you don't want the reading pane.\n\n40\n00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.120\nTurn it off.\nThe To Do is where you can choose to put\n\n41\n00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.456\nthe calendar, your people and/or\nyour tasks over on that pane.\n\n42\n00:01:53.456 --> 00:01:55.650\nActually the tasks are behind\nmy head right there.\n\n43\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.270\nAnd so you can go ahead and\norganize the ones that you want to do and\n\n44\n00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.172\nyou can scroll through them.\n\n45\n00:02:02.172 --> 00:02:06.090\nAnd I can keep them on or\nkeep them off, if I wanted to.\n\n46\n00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.290\nI'll take that To Do bar off.\n\n47\n00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.850\nThe people pane is something that\nyou could use to where it puts it at\n\n48\n00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.640\nthe bottom of the email messages.\n\n49\n00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.160\nAnd actually the people pane, and\nthe reading pane, the folder pane,\n\n50\n00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.680\nit does not matter if\nyou are in the mail or\n\n51\n00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.550\nthe calendar or your contacts all of\nthese buttons are going to be available\n\n52\n00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.400\nto you because they are kind of\nfundamental pieces of Outlook.\n\n53\n00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.970\nBut I will say your reading pane and\nyour people pane,\n\n54\n00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.190\nthey look a little different\nif you're in say the calendar.\n\n55\n00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.330\nThe calendar is going to be the reading\npane on the actual meeting,\n\n56\n00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.740\nit's not going to be on your email.\n\n57\n00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.470\nSo we normally associate with reading\nan email, but does go across other areas.\n\n58\n00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.020\nSo those are all things\nthat we have done before.\n\n59\n00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.280\nAnd coming over here to the left\nhand side of our View tab,\n\n60\n00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.490\nwe have different ways that we can look at\nit, it's like a theme, if you wanna say.\n\n61\n00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.420\nThe compact view that we're looking at\nnow is what we're looking at right now.\n\n62\n00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.820\nIf I click on single,\nthis puts everything into single lines.\n\n63\n00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.142\nAnd if I come over here to Preview, the\npreview just takes off the reading pane,\n\n64\n00:03:23.142 --> 00:03:25.929\nputs everything into a columnized list.\n\n65\n00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:30.322\nAnd it's kind of like in Windows Explorer\nwhere you can show as icons or\n\n66\n00:03:30.322 --> 00:03:31.300\nshow details.\n\n67\n00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.495\nYou can show all the details\nof like the file size and\n\n68\n00:03:34.495 --> 00:03:37.070\nlike the date that it was created.\n\n69\n00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.024\nI usually like that view because\nI want to see all these pieces.\n\n70\n00:03:40.024 --> 00:03:44.720\nSo I can see from this Details view\nthat I have different columns.\n\n71\n00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.810\nAnd across the top, I have these\nrow headers, where the exclamation,\n\n72\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.370\nthat's our importance.\n\n73\n00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.420\nI have my alert, if I have set\na reminder for that, if what type of\n\n74\n00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.890\nicon that that is associated with, either\nlike a forward, or a medium request.\n\n75\n00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.490\nThe from, the subject received,\n\n76\n00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.200\nthink you can kinda read them across\nto see that the different categories or\n\n77\n00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.380\ncolumn headers,\nthat you have within this particular view.\n\n78\n00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:18.080\nYou can change all of this, you could add\nnew columns, you could move them around.\n\n79\n00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.076\nMaybe you want to have the subject first,\nand then who it's from.\n\n80\n00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:25.410\nMaybe you want it to have received\nas the first thing that you see\n\n81\n00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.510\nafter these little icons.\n\n82\n00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.730\nMaybe you don't want any\nof these icon columns.\n\n83\n00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.760\nYou can go crazy with how\nmuch you want to change this.\n\n84\n00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.610\nIn this particular view,\nyou also can change the column widths.\n\n85\n00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.150\nYou get the line with the two\npointed arrows on either side and\n\n86\n00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.800\nyou can change how wide or how not wide\n\n87\n00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.560\nyou want one of these columns\nto show the information.\n\n88\n00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.730\nMaybe the subject would\nbe a little bit bigger.\n\n89\n00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.440\nWhoops, I actually just sorted it.\n\n90\n00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.730\nThe subject would be a little bit\nbigger than the received or from.\n\n91\n00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.940\nI want received over on that side.\n\n92\n00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.455\nYou just click, hold, and drag it.\n\n93\n00:05:01.455 --> 00:05:06.776\nClick+hold drag and you just watch for\nthose little red lines that come\n\n94\n00:05:06.776 --> 00:05:12.020\nto show you where it's going to be in\nthat new location when you let go.\n\n95\n00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:19.270\nAnd now you can see that I'm reordering or\nrestructuring what columns are where.\n\n96\n00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.130\nThe little triangle things on the top\nof each one of these columns,\n\n97\n00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.710\nthese are your sorts.\n\n98\n00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:32.100\nNow we will get into the sort and\nsearch in just little bit.\n\n99\n00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.502\nSince we are here,\nthe receive means it is going to show like\n\n100\n00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:40.760\nthis is the latest date on top,\nlike the newest.\n\n101\n00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.020\nSo if I scroll up.\n\n102\n00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.440\nSo here's today.\n\n103\n00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.750\nIf I click on here it's\ngoing to sort by the oldest.\n\n104\n00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.330\nSo those are some quick ways within\nthis particular view that you can sort.\n\n105\n00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.050\nMaybe I want to sort from the person.\n\n106\n00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.759\nFrom Justin and then from Justin.\n\n107\n00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:59.070\n[LAUGH] There's a lot\nof things from Justin.\n\n108\n00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.721\nThere we go, Yammer,\nso you can see Yammer,\n\n109\n00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:07.633\nthis is sorting descending as\noppose to sorting ascending.\n\n110\n00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:12.531\nAnd so, b, there we go, so the band Boys,\nis the one that's going to be in\n\n111\n00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:16.334\nthe first thing of our ascending\norder of the from field.\n\n112\n00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:20.930\nSo you can change it right from dragging\nand dropping and changing the columns.\n\n113\n00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.520\nBut the other columns, I wanna add,\nsay like a sensitivity column,\n\n114\n00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.030\ncuz we talked about adding sensitivity\nlevels in our email options,\n\n115\n00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.040\nin our advanced features episode.\n\n116\n00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.310\nI don't see that in here.\n\n117\n00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.320\nOver on the left hand side,\nyou can customize these view settings.\n\n118\n00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.507\nWhen you come into your Advanced View\nsettings in the columns,\n\n119\n00:06:41.507 --> 00:06:45.062\nthat first option right there,\nthis is where it shows\n\n120\n00:06:45.062 --> 00:06:49.027\nyou the columns that in this\nparticular view in this order.\n\n121\n00:06:49.027 --> 00:06:53.000\nAnd these are all of\nthe different properties or\n\n122\n00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.175\ncolumns that are available for\nyou to see your list of emails.\n\n123\n00:06:58.175 --> 00:07:01.410\nThe one that I had set\nwas the sensitivity.\n\n124\n00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.885\nI wanna bring that over,\nso I click on the left.\n\n125\n00:07:03.885 --> 00:07:08.290\nTell it come on over by\nclicking the add on the right.\n\n126\n00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.016\nI don't want the sensitivity to be on\nthe very last column, so you click and\n\n127\n00:07:12.016 --> 00:07:12.950\nmove it up.\n\n128\n00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.740\nI can click the move up button\nto put it whatever I want.\n\n129\n00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.151\nYou might go ahead and\nput it in the very beginning.\n\n130\n00:07:19.151 --> 00:07:21.067\nClick OK.\nWe'll come back to this is just a sec and\n\n131\n00:07:21.067 --> 00:07:23.190\ngo through some of these other ones.\n\n132\n00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:28.020\nAnd you can see the results of the\nsensitivity now has it's own column within\n\n133\n00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.040\nthis Preview view.\n\n134\n00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.520\nOther things that I could set,\nthe Group By, this is the one that where\n\n135\n00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.780\nit's grouping by the today,\nor last week, or yesterday.\n\n136\n00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.060\nThat's on by default.\n\n137\n00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.795\nBut you could also if you wanted to have\nit stop grouping automatically based on\n\n138\n00:07:46.795 --> 00:07:47.953\nthe arrangement.\n\n139\n00:07:47.953 --> 00:07:53.179\nSo if I had arranged this to be by\nthe To field or by the Subject,\n\n140\n00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:57.212\nthen it would group it\nin automatically for me.\n\n141\n00:07:57.212 --> 00:08:00.854\nI can choose to group it by,\nlet's say, and\n\n142\n00:08:00.854 --> 00:08:05.110\nthis is where we could go,\nwe could say from.\n\n143\n00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.930\nWho is it from, and then by?\n\n144\n00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:11.790\nSo you can have multiple\nlevel types of grouping, and\n\n145\n00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.920\nI guess in the same sense sorting as well.\n\n146\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.189\nIt is sorting your information around.\n\n147\n00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.160\nSo we could choose which one and\nlet's say by attachment.\n\n148\n00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.840\nSo who it's from and\nthen with the attachment click OK.\n\n149\n00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.870\nClick OK.\n\n150\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.670\nWell, I can tell you right now\nI'm starting to get a, actually,\n\n151\n00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.330\nI don't even know what I'm\nlooking at anymore [LAUGH].\n\n152\n00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.380\n&gt;&gt; You've really gone\nberserk on this thing.\n\n153\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.390\n&gt;&gt; I have, yes.\n\n154\n00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:38.540\nBut it is, but\nyou can see from Joey by attachments.\n\n155\n00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.550\nI don't really have a lot of attachments,\nso\n\n156\n00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:46.670\nthat might not have been the best\ncriteria to go ahead and group by.\n\n157\n00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:51.220\nBut I hope you're getting the idea\nhere is that you can sit here and\n\n158\n00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:57.210\ncustomize to your heart's content\nto how you want to see this view.\n\n159\n00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:01.990\nNow, I already said I'm kinda getting\na little far off the track where like, so,\n\n160\n00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.070\ncan we just go back to\nthe way it used to be?\n\n161\n00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:08.284\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love, I always end up tweaking\nthese things to where they're unusable.\n\n162\n00:09:08.284 --> 00:09:09.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n163\n00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.085\nkinda like what I'm doing right now.\n\n164\n00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:13.560\n[LAUGH] You can always reset it.\n\n165\n00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.240\nYay, reset button.\n\n166\n00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.700\nOver here on the left-hand side.\n\n167\n00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.910\nYou click it, are you sure you\nwould like to reset the preview?\n\n168\n00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.360\nRemember, we had the compact,\npreview, and single?\n\n169\n00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.100\nI want to set the preview back\nto its original settings.\n\n170\n00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.150\nYou click yes, and phew,\nokay, now it's good.\n\n171\n00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.965\n&gt;&gt; Things look normal.\n\n172\n00:09:31.965 --> 00:09:32.551\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n173\n00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:35.080\n[LAUGH] We're back to where we started,\nbut\n\n174\n00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.010\nthat's the nice thing,\nit's like a safety net.\n\n175\n00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.160\nSo get in there, dig in there,\n\n176\n00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.780\ncustomize it cuz maybe you might find I\nreally like this, for you to keep it.\n\n177\n00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.690\nAnd then you can move on and then if you\ndon't like it you can always reset it.\n\n178\n00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:52.600\nA few of the ones that I did want to point\nout that I had been using to help me in\n\n179\n00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.860\nwhat I'm looking at, it's the customizing,\nbut then it goes back into the organizing.\n\n180\n00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.848\nSo organize and customize.\n\n181\n00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:04.920\n[LAUGH] Go into view, we have our other\nsettings and the conditional formats.\n\n182\n00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.150\nThe other settings in here.\n\n183\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:12.960\nWhat is the font of my column heading,\nmy column fonts and my row fonts.\n\n184\n00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.950\nWhat does that mean?\n\n185\n00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.450\nI'm gonna click OK, and OK here.\n\n186\n00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:20.780\nYour rows are basically the list\nof all of your e-mails.\n\n187\n00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.340\nThe column headings are the ones\nup here on the top.\n\n188\n00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.970\nThe from and the subject.\n\n189\n00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.190\nComing back into the view settings and\nto the other settings.\n\n190\n00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:35.160\nYou can change all of the default\nfonts that you have in anything.\n\n191\n00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.170\nThat's kinda hard to say.\n\n192\n00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.980\n&gt;&gt; All the default fonts, I love that.\n\n193\n00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.531\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n194\n00:10:38.531 --> 00:10:41.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That actually came out of my mouth\n\n195\n00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:41.900\ndidn't it.\n\n196\n00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.730\nAnd I kept on going like\nI think that was wrong.\n\n197\n00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.100\n&gt;&gt; This is happening\n&gt;&gt; That's kind\n\n198\n00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.480\nof hard to say a bunch of times.\n\n199\n00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.670\n&gt;&gt; You committed to it, though.\n\n200\n00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.600\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you\n&gt;&gt; Got to give you credit.\n\n201\n00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.670\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do that a lot where I'm like\nwait, did I just say something wrong?\n\n202\n00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.890\n&gt;&gt;

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.860\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n4\n00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.210\nwe're coming back at you with\nmore of our Outlook 2016 series.\n\n5\n00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.020\nJoining us in the studio, the Outlook\nmistress herself, Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n6\n00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.796\nMiss Vonne Smith, welcome,\nhow's it going today?\n\n7\n00:00:22.796 --> 00:00:24.502\n&gt;&gt; I like that title [LAUGH].\n\n8\n00:00:24.502 --> 00:00:28.274\n&gt;&gt; We give her cool titles\nthat she enjoys [LAUGH].\n\n9\n00:00:28.274 --> 00:00:31.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we are here today to\ntalk about rules and automation.\n\n10\n00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.864\nActually I had to look down,\nI'm like, which one are we doing?\n\n11\n00:00:33.864 --> 00:00:38.700\nWe are doing rules and automation, we're\ngoing to be faster and leaner, and quicker\n\n12\n00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.460\nand meaner, and sounds like we're training\nfor a boxing match or something [LAUGH].\n\n13\n00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.505\nBut this is just ways that we\ncould go ahead and start, well,\n\n14\n00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:50.350\nautomating some of our tests that we do\nin Outlook to make us more efficient.\n\n15\n00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.048\nSo let's jump down into Justin's email,\nbecause I wanted to give you an example\n\n16\n00:00:55.048 --> 00:00:58.158\nof the finished product of\nwhere we're going to, and\n\n17\n00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:01.079\nthe first one that we gonna\ndo is just Quick Parts.\n\n18\n00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.577\nWell, Quick Parts, putting in parts of\nan email that, well, are quick [LAUGH].\n\n19\n00:01:06.577 --> 00:01:08.317\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Very descriptive.\n\n20\n00:01:08.317 --> 00:01:09.583\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n21\n00:01:09.583 --> 00:01:11.275\n&gt;&gt; Tell us more about that\nthing you said [LAUGH].\n\n22\n00:01:11.275 --> 00:01:16.440\n&gt;&gt; They label it very well, so I'm in\nJT's email and let's start a new email.\n\n23\n00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.386\nMaybe you have to send out a bunch of\nemails that always have the same amount of\n\n24\n00:01:21.386 --> 00:01:22.091\ncontent.\n\n25\n00:01:22.091 --> 00:01:26.617\nMaybe you're running a contest or\nsome type of promotion and it's like,\n\n26\n00:01:26.617 --> 00:01:28.880\nclick here to ask us more questions.\n\n27\n00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.962\nAnd they email you like,\nI'd like to know more about\n\n28\n00:01:31.962 --> 00:01:35.900\nthat trip that you're promoting\nto Australia, or what have you.\n\n29\n00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.371\nI think that's what the Quick Parts, at\nleast that's what I already made it into,\n\n30\n00:01:39.371 --> 00:01:40.581\n[LAUGH], so we'll find out.\n\n31\n00:01:40.581 --> 00:01:41.855\nSo I don't wanna have to keep typing.\n\n32\n00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:44.397\nNow, yes, you could go and\nfind another email,\n\n33\n00:01:44.397 --> 00:01:46.815\ncopy up the information,\npaste it into here.\n\n34\n00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:49.760\nBut what if it was just ready to go,\nkinda like a stamp?\n\n35\n00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.630\nI want that stamp, and\nthen you put it on the email,\n\n36\n00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.550\nand it just puts the content in.\n\n37\n00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.500\n&gt;&gt; So you're rubber stamping\nthings that you want to do\n\n38\n00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.260\nvery quickly that you normally tend to do.\n\n39\n00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.755\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you can put in pictures,\ntables, charts,\n\n40\n00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:08.192\nwhatever you want, any type of content.\n\n41\n00:02:08.192 --> 00:02:12.900\nWell, you create it first, you select it,\nyou add it into the Quick Parts library.\n\n42\n00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.180\nAnd then when you're ready to go, you just\npick out a library and just put it in.\n\n43\n00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.910\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'm sold.\n\n44\n00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.245\nI wanna see how to do this,\ncuz this actually sounds very efficient.\n\n45\n00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:24.240\n&gt;&gt; It is, so here we go,\nI'm in a new email body.\n\n46\n00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.930\nWe go over to the Insert tab,\nand in this Insert tab,\n\n47\n00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.570\nover towards the right-hand side in\nthe Text group, there is Quick Parts.\n\n48\n00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.010\nNow Quick Parts, this is not just\nsomething that's in Outlook,\n\n49\n00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.430\nthis is something that's in Word too.\n\n50\n00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.340\nBecause, of course, we're really\nusing Word inside of Outlook anyways.\n\n51\n00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.160\nAnd so we have our Quick Parts gallery,\n\n52\n00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.640\nyou can see that the very first one that I\nhave, I've already made something in here.\n\n53\n00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.203\nSo I wanna put my cursor\nwhere I want that to be.\n\n54\n00:02:49.203 --> 00:02:53.680\nGo into Quick Parts, click it, and\nboom, it just put in all of that.\n\n55\n00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.950\nIt went ahead and put in the paragraphs,\nthe link that I wanted to,\n\n56\n00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.920\na bulleted list, a picture.\n\n57\n00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.987\nAnd here we go, this is like, hey, thank\nyou for your inquiry, here's our page.\n\n58\n00:03:02.987 --> 00:03:06.659\nAnd this is an actual live page,\nand I was looking through and\n\n59\n00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.753\nnow I wanna go to Australia [LAUGH].\n\n60\n00:03:08.753 --> 00:03:09.803\nSo you can see, and\n\n61\n00:03:09.803 --> 00:03:14.345\nI took it right from the website about the\ninformation about going to the Outback.\n\n62\n00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:17.660\nAnd there you go, address it, send it off.\n\n63\n00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.918\nAnd there you go, wonderful.\n\n64\n00:03:18.918 --> 00:03:22.356\nI can add as many things as I\nwant into my Quick Parts Library.\n\n65\n00:03:22.356 --> 00:03:27.690\nThere is something known as AutoText\nas well, how are they different?\n\n66\n00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.340\nWell, I would say AutoText is more for\njust text,\n\n67\n00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.410\nthe Quick Parts is where you can put\na bunch of other things, the images, and\n\n68\n00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.340\nthe links, and the tables,\nand things like that.\n\n69\n00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.070\nBut you could save anything to either\npart, the Quick Parts or the AutoText.\n\n70\n00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.590\nAnd this is just a bulleted\nlist that I added in here.\n\n71\n00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.980\nI'm gonna make sure,\n\n72\n00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.190\nalways make sure your cursor's in\nthe place where you want it to go.\n\n73\n00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.215\nSo let me go to Quick Parts, AutoText,\ncome down to this list of chapters,\n\n74\n00:03:56.215 --> 00:03:58.415\nand then it just goes ahead and\nputs that list of chapters in.\n\n75\n00:03:58.415 --> 00:04:00.605\nSo really it's more for\ntext information, but\n\n76\n00:04:00.605 --> 00:04:03.613\nit all is part of what's\nknown as building blocks.\n\n77\n00:04:03.613 --> 00:04:05.420\nAnd there's these building blocks,\n\n78\n00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.587\nthese are called, I think they\nactually used to call it AutoText.\n\n79\n00:04:08.587 --> 00:04:12.111\nAnd now AutoText has become just\nlike a piece of the building blocks,\n\n80\n00:04:12.111 --> 00:04:14.070\nwhich is part of Quick Parts.\n\n81\n00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.890\nAll words that you might see,\n\n82\n00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.490\nwell you will see if you\nstart looking this stuff up.\n\n83\n00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.598\nBut for the most part it just\nsaves stuff for you, it's great.\n\n84\n00:04:22.598 --> 00:04:24.000\nYeah, so how do I make it?\n\n85\n00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.580\nLet's come over here to Joey's machine.\n\n86\n00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.571\nAnd I have that email with all\nthe same content ready to go,\n\n87\n00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:36.065\nbecause Joey doesn't have anything\nin his Quick Parts Library.\n\n88\n00:04:36.065 --> 00:04:41.251\nSo, to make it go a little faster,\nI have one ready to go for us.\n\n89\n00:04:41.251 --> 00:04:45.740\nAnd I have it in the Draft folder, so\nI'd saved it for Joey to be able to use.\n\n90\n00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.775\nSo I've composed everything that I want.\n\n91\n00:04:48.775 --> 00:04:52.935\nI can do a Ctrl+A, Ctrl+A is select all,\nor you can click, hold and drag,\n\n92\n00:04:52.935 --> 00:04:55.300\nwhichever way makes you feel better.\n\n93\n00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.552\nTo go ahead and select the information\nthat you want to become a Quick Part.\n\n94\n00:05:00.552 --> 00:05:03.882\nYou go back over the same place I\nwas just in on the Insert tab, and\n\n95\n00:05:03.882 --> 00:05:07.461\nthen in the Quick Parts,\nnotice that this looks a little different,\n\n96\n00:05:07.461 --> 00:05:10.460\nbecause the resolution\nwill change on this one.\n\n97\n00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.550\nSave Selection to Quick Part Gallery.\n\n98\n00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.206\nl think l called it a library, gallery,\nlibrary, it's close enough [LAUGH].\n\n99\n00:05:18.206 --> 00:05:20.700\nThe container of where it's going to.\n\n100\n00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.481\nAnd so we can name this our,\nnot Outlook, Outback promo,\n\n101\n00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:29.688\nand it's going to go into\nthe Quick Parts Gallery.\n\n102\n00:05:29.688 --> 00:05:32.990\nNotice there are other things in here,\nbut these are the things that are,\n\n103\n00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.702\nlike I said, that are coming to Word.\n\n104\n00:05:34.702 --> 00:05:38.216\nThat, if you do use Word, and you can\ninsert your headers, your footers, and\n\n105\n00:05:38.216 --> 00:05:39.130\nyour page numbers.\n\n106\n00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.080\nThis is where it stores\neverything into those quick to\n\n107\n00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.340\nuse selections when you say Insert Header.\n\n108\n00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.485\nDon't worry about where it's going,\njust keep the default,\n\n109\n00:05:49.485 --> 00:05:51.750\nyou can keep the category\nas general as well.\n\n110\n00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.775\nI wouldn't get too crazy with this,\n\n111\n00:05:53.775 --> 00:05:56.989\njust keep it all in the same\nplace as where it tells it to go.\n\n112\n00:05:56.989 --> 00:06:02.510\nYou click OK, now I'm ready to start my\nnew mail just like we did with Justin.\n\n113\n00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.090\nInsert, Quick Parts, and\nthere it is, easy peasy [LAUGH].\n\n114\n00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.043\n&gt;&gt; Lemon squeezy [LAUGH].\n\n115\n00:06:09.043 --> 00:06:10.745\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n116\n00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:15.556\nNow, another thing that you\ncould do within your messages\n\n117\n00:06:15.556 --> 00:06:17.823\nis something known as Tap.\n\n118\n00:06:17.823 --> 00:06:22.850\nAnd this is definitely newer than,\nold, wow.\n\n119\n00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Newer than old.\n\n120\n00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:30.927\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just said that [LAUGH],\nit's a newer feature.\n\n121\n00:06:30.927 --> 00:06:34.769\nIt works by adding parts of a document.\n\n122\n00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:38.874\nInstead of inserting an entire file,\nhey, go ahead and look at this report,\n\n123\n00:06:38.874 --> 00:06:41.940\nwhat if you only wanted\nthe chart out of that report?\n\n124\n00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.420\nOr maybe you just wanted\nto send somebody one slide\n\n125\n00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.470\nout of your PowerPoint presentation.\n\n126\n00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.390\nThat's where you get into\nyour Tap functions, and\n\n127\n00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.350\nit's called a document item.\n\n128\n00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.698\nNotice it says, find and reuse parts\nof documents within your organization.\n\n129\n00:06:56.698 --> 00:07:01.218\nWithin your organization,\ncuz I did do some research on this,\n\n130\n00:07:01.218 --> 00:07:05.760\nit pulls from your OneDrive\nand/or your SharePoint account.\n\n131\n00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:11.161\nSo you can't necessarily go out and\nsearch for it on your desktop.\n\n132\n00:07:11.161 --> 00:07:12.290\n&gt;&gt; Interesting feature.\n\n133\n00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's why I was like, well,\n\n134\n00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.150\nI wanna do something that's\nfiles on my computer.\n\n135\n00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.955\nBut it seems to only want to pull from\na OneDrive account or a SharePoint.\n\n136\n00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:23.245\nIt's part of the Office 365,\n\n137\n00:07:23.245 --> 00:07:26.390\nyou do have to have an Office 365\naccount to be able to use this feature.\n\n138\n00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.050\nSo you have a standalone,\nnot 365-associated account,\n\n139\n00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.320\nthen that's not going to work.\n\n140\n00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.490\nSo just make sure you're\nkind of looking for that.\n\n141\n00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.950\nSo there are items in my\nOne Drive account for\n\n142\n00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:44.040\nJoey that I put in here just to kinda give\nus little bit of something to look at.\n\n143\n00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.070\nNotice it has document and\nit says nothing to insert.\n\n144\n00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:53.174\nSo it is finding information that\nit can kind of identify as a piece,\n\n145\n00:07:53.174 --> 00:07:55.111\nlike a table in Word.\n\n146\n00:07:55.111 --> 00:07:59.934\nThis Test 1, this is the one that I\nused for the Alice text document,\n\n147\n00:07:59.934 --> 00:08:04.839\nwhere I copied from the Alice in\nWonderland And it had a table and notice\n\n148\n00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:10.432\nthat it's showing me, hey, you wanna\nadd this table from that Word document.\n\n149\n00:08:10.432 --> 00:08:12.934\nBut this document has text in it, but\n\n150\n00:08:12.934 --> 00:08:17.064\nit's not giving me anything to\nkind of find pieces out of it.\n\n151\n00:08:17.064 --> 00:08:23.862\nSo it can only identify certain\nthings within our files.\n\n152\n00:08:23.862 --> 00:08:26.944\nIn our OneDrive and/or\nSharePoint accounts.\n\n153\n00:08:26.944 --> 00:08:30.304\nNow I know I have a PowerPoint\npresentation in here, and\n\n154\n00:08:30.304 --> 00:08:32.963\nI know it's called Prepare Presentation.\n\n155\n00:08:32.963 --> 00:08:35.640\nBut it's not showing up\nin my Recommended Files.\n\n156\n00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.800\nThanks for recommending,\nbut I don't want these.\n\n157\n00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.775\nSo if I search my OneDrive and\nSharePoint accounts for prepare,\n\n158\n00:08:43.775 --> 00:08:46.575\nbecause I know that that is in the title.\n\n159\n00:08:46.575 --> 00:08:50.010\nNotice it's going to come up\nwith the Prepare Presentation,\n\n160\n00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.850\nand it's going to bring up the slides.\n\n161\n00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.900\nIt's actually behind my head, but there's\na couple little buttons right there.\n\n162\n00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.300\nThere's the little dot, dot,\n\n163\n00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.590\ndot buttons that if I click on it,\nit's going to show me all the items.\n\n164\n00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:08.812\nI can even open the information or the\nactual file in PowerPoint right from here.\n\n165\n00:09:08.812 --> 00:09:13.400\nSo there's a website that I have in\nthe notes that shows this, what it's use\n\n166\n00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:18.200\ncontent that you need without ever\nleaving, it says Word or Outlook.\n\n167\n00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.066\nSo it's trying to be\nthe kinda one stop shop and\n\n168\n00:09:21.066 --> 00:09:25.257\nuse that collaboration that it\nuses with OneDrive and SharePoint,\n\n169\n00:09:25.257 --> 00:09:28.507\nand be able to kind of make\nit a little easier for you.\n\n170\n00:09:28.507 --> 00:09:31.443\nI'm gonna View all items here.\n\n171\n00:09:31.443 --> 00:09:35.501\nAnd so it's showing all the different\nslides that are in this presentation.\n\n172\n00:09:35.501 --> 00:09:39.533\nCuz may be I would like to just\nadd this cute little slide,\n\n173\n00:09:39.533 --> 00:09:43.280\nto my document or\nguess in this case my message.\n\n174\n00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.360\nClick outside.\n\n175\n00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.156\nThere we go and then it goes ahead and\nputs the slide right into,\n\n176\n00:09:49.156 --> 00:09:51.502\nI put it twice I got\na little quick copy there.\n\n177\n00:09:51.502 --> 00:09:52.804\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n178\n00:09:52.804 --> 00:09:55.377\n&gt;&gt; I did, I was totally total Jimmy click\n\n179\n00:09:55.377 --> 00:09:56.108\nit there.\n\n180\n00:09:56.108 --> 00:09:59.547\nSo I go ahead and put just that\none piece within that document.\n\n181\n00:09:59.547 --> 00:10:04.717\nSo it can be really handle if you\nuse your OneDrive folder I guess,\n\n182\n00:10:04.717 --> 00:10:09.041\ncuz there are sorts of storage\ndevice all the time, and\n\n183\n00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:13.880\nbe able to have documents that\nhave peaceable information.\n\n184\n00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.920\nSo you do have to kinda\nhave both of those factors,\n\n185\n00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.830\nto be able to use the document item or\nwhat it's really named is TAP.\n\n186\n00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.945\nSo that's where we can get\na a little bit more efficient.\n\n187\n00:10:23.945 --> 00:10:26.485\nI'm going to go ahead and\nselect this and close it out.\n\n188\n00:10:27.625 --> 00:10:30.520\nQuick steps, just like it sounds like.\n\n189\n00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.479\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's an old timey dance from the 20s.\n\n190\n00:10:32.479 --> 00:10:33.090\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah.\n\n191\n00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.151\nWe can do a little.\n\n192\n00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:35.727\n&gt;&gt; Quick Step.\n[LAUGH]\n\n193\n00:10:35.727 --> 00:10:36.555\n&gt;&gt; I don't think that's\n\n194\n00:10:36.555 --> 00:10:37.343\nthe Quick Step, so.\n\n195\n00:10:37.343 --> 00:10:38.239\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't pay money [INAUDIBLE].\n\n196\n00:10:38.239 --> 00:10:41.036\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well actually my parents do ballroom\n\n197\n00:10:41.036 --> 00:10:41.895\ndancing for real.\n\n198\n00:10:41.895 --> 00:10:42.779\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]?\n\n199\n00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:45.538\n&gt;&gt; So if they saw me doing that for\nthe Quick Step, they'd probably be like,\n\n200\n00:10:45.538 --> 00:10:46.884\nno Vonne, that's not how it goes.\n\n201\n00:10:46.884 --> 00:10:47.396\n&gt;&gt; Wrong.\n\n202\n00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:48.293\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n203\n00:10:48.293 --> 00:10:50.932\nthen they probably try to show me, I'm\nlike [SOUND], no, that's not [INAUDIBLE]\n\n204\n00:10:50.932 --> 00:10:51.833\n&gt;&gt; Plus your form was horrible,\n\n205\n00:10:51.833 --> 00:10:52.705\nyou have to keep your.\n\n206\n00:10:52.705 --> 00:10:53.619\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the whole frame.\n\n207\n00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:55.411\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's tango.\n\n208\n00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:59.043\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So what are quick steps?\n\n209\n00:10:59.043 --> 00:11:00.891\n[SOUND] Yeah.\n\n210\n00:11:00.891 --> 00:11:03.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How's that different from Quick Parts?\n\n211\n00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.250\nRight, we've got Quick Parts and\n\n212\n00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.280\nQuick Steps, they sound like\nthey're probably pretty similar.\n\n213\n00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.361\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a great question.\n\n214\n00:11:10.361 --> 00:11:14.664\nQuick Parts are the things that part\nthat we put into a message body.\n\n215\n00:11:14.664 --> 00:11:18.764\nQuick Steps, if you think about\nsteps that we do in Outlook.\n\n216\n00:11:18.764 --> 00:11:24.016\nMaybe every Friday, you send out a message\nto your group that there is cake\n\n217\n00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:29.013\nin the break room, because you always\nhave cake at this one meeting and\n\n218\n00:11:29.013 --> 00:11:33.269\nthere's always leftovers, and\nyou send it every Friday.\n\n219\n00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:35.372\nHey, come get cake in a break room.\n\n220\n00:11:35.372 --> 00:11:39.513\nSo those would be okay, I'd opened up\nan email, I addressed it too, the same\n\n221\n00:11:39.513 --> 00:11:44.650\nthree or four people, I will say the same\nmessage body and I would click send.\n\n222\n00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:49.100\nYou could put that into a Quick Step,\nsay hey one stop shop click a button and\n\n223\n00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.460\nwhoop does the whole thing for you.\n\n224\n00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.660\n&gt;&gt; That does sound pretty delightful.\n\n225\n00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:57.420\nI mean, we do tend to do, when you're\nin an environment like a business.\n\n226\n00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.120\nMaybe not so much at home, you're\nprobably, if you're a home user you're\n\n227\n00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.570\ngonna be sending out random emails and\nworking with different people that way.\n\n228\n00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:07.240\nBut in business environments,\nyou tend to do repetitive tasks.\n\n229\n00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.115\nAnd this can really\nsave you a lot of time,\n\n230\n00:12:09.115 --> 00:12:12.329\nbecause I don't know about you Vonne,\nbut I'm definitely been like,\n\n231\n00:12:12.329 --> 00:12:15.988\nI have six other things to do before I can\nget to things you've just asked me to do.\n\n232\n00:12:15.988 --> 00:12:16.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know you think\n\n233\n00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:17.365\nit's a five alarm fire.\n\n234\n00:12:17.365 --> 00:12:18.588\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n235\n00:12:18.588 --> 00:12:20.606\nlet me tell you where that's gonna end up.\n\n236\n00:12:20.606 --> 00:12:24.998\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we get, what is that we\nalways see, turn in your time clocks,\n\n237\n00:12:24.998 --> 00:12:27.312\nsheets or whatever for the managers.\n\n238\n00:12:27.312 --> 00:12:30.740\nAnd hey, send this report in or\nmake sure you check that.\n\n239\n00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.362\nMake it a Quick Step, and\nit makes your life a lot easier.\n\n240\n00:12:33.362 --> 00:12:35.901\nSo let's switch over into JT's account.\n\n241\n00:12:35.901 --> 00:12:37.480\nSo I've already switched over.\n\n242\n00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.890\nI'll go ahead and close this message.\n\n243\n00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.640\nAnd I don't wanna save the changes here.\n\n244\n00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.560\nI've actually already created\nsome Quick Steps you can see.\n\n245\n00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.550\nAnd I have food in the break room.\n\n246\n00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.950\nSo this is on our home\ntab of our mail section,\n\n247\n00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.200\nand it is labeled as\nthe group Quick Steps.\n\n248\n00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.780\nAnd there's a little list that's in here.\n\n249\n00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.000\nAnd there's some that\ncome in automatically.\n\n250\n00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.380\nI think there was the team email and\nthe team manager,\n\n251\n00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:03.150\nbut I made the move Lance and\nI also did the food in the break room.\n\n252\n00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.473\nCuz this is also not just for\nmail, necessarily.\n\n253\n00:13:06.473 --> 00:13:07.697\nIt's for everything.\n\n254\n00:13:07.697 --> 00:13:12.031\nYou'll see when we get into the step\nby step of what you want to program\n\n255\n00:13:12.031 --> 00:13:12.946\nas your step.\n\n256\n00:13:12.946 --> 00:13:14.042\nIt's like macros.\n\n257\n00:13:14.042 --> 00:13:17.264\nIf you know anything about macros and\nother products,\n\n258\n00:13:17.264 --> 00:13:21.125\nit's just recorded steps into\na clickable button a lot of times.\n\n259\n00:13:21.125 --> 00:13:21.740\nThat's what we're doing.\n\n260\n00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.460\nSo food in break room.\n\n261\n00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:24.960\nI click it.\n\n262\n00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.720\nOpens up a new message, it addressed\nit to three people, puts a subject and\n\n263\n00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.890\nputs in the body.\n\n264\n00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.610\nThen all I gotta do is click Send.\n\n265\n00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:34.524\n&gt;&gt; That is amazing stuff.\n\n266\n00:13:34.524 --> 00:13:35.369\n&gt;&gt; It is isn't it.\n\n267\n00:13:35.369 --> 00:13:40.280\n[LAUGH] The move Lance,\nthat would be if I had a specific email\n\n268\n00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.060\nfrom Lance that I want to move\ninto the Lance folder, and\n\n269\n00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.490\nthen I can also set a category on it,\neverything.\n\n270\n00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:52.254\nLet's jump over into Joey, and see what\nwe could do with making our Quick Steps.\n\n271\n00:13:52.254 --> 00:13:55.854\nSo We go into the home tab,\nwe go into that little drop down,\n\n272\n00:13:55.854 --> 00:13:58.744\nnotice New Quick Step,\nand we can go into here.\n\n273\n00:13:58.744 --> 00:14:00.922\nAnd we can also Manage Quick Step.\n\n274\n00:14:00.922 --> 00:14:02.190\nSo let's go to this place.\n\n275\n00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.163\nWe can kinda see the whole thing.\n\n276\n00:14:04.163 --> 00:14:10.066\nClick here, these are the Quick Steps that\nI already have recorded in Joey's account.\n\n277\n00:14:10.066 --> 00:14:11.882\nAnd actually I don't even\nremember making this one.\n\n278\n00:14:11.882 --> 00:14:12.645\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n279\n00:14:12.645 --> 00:14:15.785\nI must have been playing around with it.\n\n280\n00:14:15.785 --> 00:14:17.255\nYes, cuz I do have a JT folder.\n\n281\n00:14:17.255 --> 00:14:23.295\nSo I made a Quick Step to move it to\nJT and mark it as read, so that's one.\n\n282\n00:14:23.295 --> 00:14:26.415\nThese are the ones that came\nwith the product to try it,\n\n283\n00:14:26.415 --> 00:14:28.690\njust give you something to start with.\n\n284\n00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:33.010\nYou could come into it and notice you\ncan edit them, you could take it, and\n\n285\n00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.130\nduplicate, and\nthen edit the other duplicate.\n\n286\n00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.700\nOr we can go ahead and\ncreate a new message.\n\n287\n00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:44.560\nSo we're going to do a new well, where's\ncustom, that's what I'm looking for.\n\n288\n00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I wanted to say New Quick Step but\n\n289\n00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.221\nI forgot that.\n\n290\n00:14:46.221 --> 00:14:46.893\n&gt;&gt; New custom.\n\n291\n00:14:46.893 --> 00:14:47.519\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n292\n00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:51.749\nwe're going to do a custom Quick Step,\nrather than the one's where it says, like,\n\n293\n00:14:51.749 --> 00:14:52.655\nFord, new mail.\n\n294\n00:14:52.655 --> 00:14:54.870\nWe can go through each step individual.\n\n295\n00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:59.500\nLet's name this, well,\nwe'll name it food and break room.\n\n296\n00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.160\nRemember that was in JT,\nnow we're in Joey.\n\n297\n00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.530\nChoose an action.\n\n298\n00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.020\nWell what action do I want to do?\n\n299\n00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.942\nAs it has things like to Move or\nDelete Message.\n\n300\n00:15:07.942 --> 00:15:11.590\nChange the status of\nthat particular message.\n\n301\n00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:15.190\nGo ahead and mark a category in here,\nset a category,\n\n302\n00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:18.190\nset a flag, go ahead and put a reminder.\n\n303\n00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.350\nWe can go ahead and\ndo different responses.\n\n304\n00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:21.070\nMake appointments.\n\n305\n00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:23.020\nSo this is not just for mail.\n\n306\n00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.288\nThis is for\na lot of different things within Outlook.\n\n307\n00:15:26.288 --> 00:15:29.966\nCuz maybe you get an email that\ntriggers you like, I gotta go ahead and\n\n308\n00:15:29.966 --> 00:15:33.093\nmake the directors meeting\nthat's gonna be on this Friday,\n\n309\n00:15:33.093 --> 00:15:34.890\nit happens once every two months.\n\n310\n00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.913\nAnd though you don't have any a calendar,\nso you can just go ahead and\n\n311\n00:15:37.913 --> 00:15:40.643\ncreate a Quick Step,\nbecause you have a few things to go with.\n\n312\n00:15:40.643 --> 00:15:43.946\nLet's go with New Message for\nthis particular one, and\n\n313\n00:15:43.946 --> 00:15:45.356\nwho is it going to be to?\n\n314\n00:15:45.356 --> 00:15:48.330\nYou could type them in or\nuse the To button to pick.\n\n315\n00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.360\nWe'll put Joey, no we're Joey right now.\n\n316\n00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.625\nSo we don't wanna email our self.\n\n317\n00:15:52.625 --> 00:15:54.041\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n318\n00:15:54.041 --> 00:15:58.243\n&gt;&gt; So we'll go with Justin,\noops, too many clicks.\n\n319\n00:15:58.243 --> 00:16:00.065\nMan, I am very click happy today.\n\n320\n00:16:00.065 --> 00:16:03.578\nWe'll go with Lance, and I think those\nare the only two people we're gonna.\n\n321\n00:16:03.578 --> 00:16:05.120\n&gt;&gt; It's the seven cups of\ncoffee you had before the show.\n\n322\n00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know.\n\n323\n00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.960\nI didn't actually even drink any coffee.\n\n324\n00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.541\nYou don't wanna see me-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Vonne's just\n\n325\n00:16:10.541 --> 00:16:11.586\nnaturally jittery [LAUGH].\n\n326\n00:16:11.586 --> 00:16:15.345\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna see me on coffee,\nit's a really scary situation.\n\n327\n00:16:15.345 --> 00:16:17.950\n[LAUGH].\nSo we have our new message,\n\n328\n00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.530\nthen we're going to start\nadding more things.\n\n329\n00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.470\nLet's add another action.\n\n330\n00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:23.970\nMaybe we can set this as important.\n\n331\n00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.610\nYay, let's add another action.\n\n332\n00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.730\nSo, you get the idea here,\n\n333\n00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:32.420\nis you just keep on adding steps,\nprogrammable things that we want to do.\n\n334\n00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.830\nLet's make a message body.\n\n335\n00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:39.550\nSo, we're going to go into new-\n&gt;&gt; New message?\n\n336\n00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:40.300\n&gt;&gt; Wait, you know what?\n\n337\n00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.320\nIt's not a step by itself.\n\n338\n00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.440\nThis is a perfect example of a K,\nI didn't wanna add another action.\n\n339\n00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.770\nWe'll, close that,\nit's the options, there we go.\n\n340\n00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:54.850\nIn the options, this is a, I thought there\nwas like compose message was a step.\n\n341\n00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:59.570\nIt's actually all within, excuse me, the\nnew message action that we're going to do.\n\n342\n00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:02.160\nSo we'll do the subject of food.\n\n343\n00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.040\nAnd maybe we'll,\nwe won't necessarily need to flag it.\n\n344\n00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.540\nBut there's the important, well,\nthe set, we can set the importance here.\n\n345\n00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.460\nWe'll close this one out, sorry.\n\n346\n00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.097\n&gt;&gt; Food in the break room\nis important [CROSSTALK]\n\n347\n00:17:11.097 --> 00:17:12.594\n&gt;&gt; It is pretty important, right?\n\n348\n00:17:12.594 --> 00:17:13.636\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n349\n00:17:13.636 --> 00:17:14.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I didn't actually have to add that\n\n350\n00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.650\nas a separate step,\nit's all within the message body.\n\n351\n00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:22.545\nAnd we could say, food in break room, run.\n\n352\n00:17:22.545 --> 00:17:26.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I like that.\n\n353\n00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.840\nSo I can add other options.\n\n354\n00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.290\nYou can categorize it, as you can see,\nwe can move on through there.\n\n355\n00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:34.510\nYou could even add a shortcut\nkey if you wanted to.\n\n356\n00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:38.318\nCTRL+SHIFT+6, cuz you'll\nalways remember that one.\n\n357\n00:17:38.318 --> 00:17:42.380\n[LAUGH] And then you could also do\nlike a tool tip text if you wanted.\n\n358\n00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.429\nI'm gonna click Finish.\n\n359\n00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.840\nAnd I'm going to say OK.\n\n360\n00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.800\nAnd now I'm ready to test it out.\n\n361\n00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.490\nWe click the button,\nmakes my message, yay.\n\n362\n00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:53.140\n&gt;&gt; Ba da bing.\n\n363\n00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:57.100\nNow Von this is very interesting because\nokay I've never seen this before,\n\n364\n00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.100\nvery cool thing.\n\n365\n00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:58.890\nI like it a lot.\n\n366\n00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.180\nI'm into things like this.\n\n367\n00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.490\nIt reminds me a lot of\nsetting a rule In Outlook so\n\n368\n00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:08.310\nthat I can make it automate\nsome processes for myself.\n\n369\n00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.180\n&gt;&gt; It is very much like that.\n\n370\n00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.690\nYou must be reading the notes, aren't you?\n\n371\n00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:11.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cuz that's the next thing.\n\n372\n00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.680\n&gt;&gt; You see what I did there?\n\n373\n00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.320\nDo you like that?\n\n374\n00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.080\nDo you like that?\n\n375\n00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:14.850\n&gt;&gt; I love your lead ins.\n\n376\n00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:15.886\nYou're just like,\n[SOUND] It's like butter.\n\n377\n00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:18.157\n[LAUGH] As we're talking about food.\n\n378\n00:18:18.157 --> 00:18:22.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, how is this different from rules?\n\n379\n00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.400\n&gt;&gt; This is something where\nyou can make your steps,\n\n380\n00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.870\nand you choose when it happens.\n\n381\n00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:33.660\nLike I have to click the button in\nthe Quick Steps gallery to say,\n\n382\n00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:36.480\nhey go ahead and write this message.\n\n383\n00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.910\nAnd notice I have to\nclick the send button.\n\n384\n00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.780\nSo I tell it to happen\nwhen I want it to happen.\n\n385\n00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.402\n&gt;&gt; And there is interaction from you.\n\n386\n00:18:45.402 --> 00:18:46.002\nMm-hm.\n\n387\n00:18:46.002 --> 00:18:48.050\nOr otherwise, it will not occur.\n\n388\n00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.780\n&gt;&gt; Correct, as opposed to to rules.\n\n389\n00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.090\nRules is where it's it's very similar.\n\n390\n00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.720\nI want to record steps\nthat are going to happen.\n\n391\n00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:04.650\nAnytime I get a new message from Lance,\nI want it to move into the Lance folder.\n\n392\n00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:07.034\nAnd I believe we mentioned this\nwhen we were talking about-\n\n393\n00:19:07.034 --> 00:19:09.060\n&gt;&gt; Creating subfolders?\n\n394\n00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:09.560\n&gt;&gt; Was that?\n\n395\n00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.180\nYes, thank you.\n\n396\n00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.550\nI'm like, I know we talked about it.\n\n397\n00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.182\nI can't remember what episode it was in.\n\n398\n00:19:13.182 --> 00:19:14.916\n[LAUGH] But we had kind of hinted to this.\n\n399\n00:19:14.916 --> 00:19:15.420\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n400\n00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.720\nSo those are things that\nhappen automatically.\n\n401\n00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.870\nThere is a trigger and then it does it.\n\n402\n00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.840\nAnd it happens kind of just running\nin the background at the whole time.\n\n403\n00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.520\nSo why don't we use that?\n\n404\n00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:32.320\nI want to create a rule that all\nmessages from Lance are going to go\n\n405\n00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.110\ninto the Lance folder.\n\n406\n00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.400\nThis is one with the Fox OMS.\n\n407\n00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:37.970\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n408\n00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.725\n&gt;&gt; Yes, any time we have our scheduling,\nI just put it,\n\n409\n00:19:39.725 --> 00:19:40.939\nit just goes right into that folder.\n\n410\n00:19:40.939 --> 00:19:42.340\nAnd I just check it every once in a while.\n\n411\n00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.150\nHow do I make this rule?\n\n412\n00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.460\nWe go into our file tab.\n\n413\n00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.159\nWe come into our Rules and Alerts.\n\n414\n00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.440\nWe click here.\n\n415\n00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.518\nThere we go.\nI almost clicked it again.\n\n416\n00:19:55.518 --> 00:19:57.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Give it a second.\n\n417\n00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.170\nSo we're in our email rules.\n\n418\n00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:01.750\nAnd our Manage Alerts,\njust to let you know.\n\n419\n00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:06.340\nThis is something that would happen\nwhen you're on like a SharePoint server,\n\n420\n00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.460\nthat you're getting\nalerted on certain things.\n\n421\n00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.360\nIf you're not using SharePoint, then I\nwouldn't worry about managing alerts.\n\n422\n00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.120\nBecause there's nothing really for\nyou to manage, cuz you don't use it.\n\n423\n00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.560\nBut the rules, those are for you, and your\nmailbox, and how you want it to happen.\n\n424\n00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.560\nSo I want to create a new rule,\nand I have all of these.\n\n425\n00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.968\nThe Rules Wizard,\nthat's kinda hard to say.\n\n426\n00:20:27.968 --> 00:20:30.590\n[LAUGH] It's gonna take\nyou through a wizard.\n\n427\n00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:34.490\nIt's just a step by step of asking you for\nthe information.\n\n428\n00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.430\nAnd it's going to go ahead and\nbuild out that thing.\n\n429\n00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:40.330\nThere's the Mail Merge Wizard in Word.\n\n430\n00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:43.070\nSo it tells you step by step,\nhere is the Rules Wizard.\n\n431\n00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.090\nWhat do I want to do?\n\n432\n00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.650\nDo I want to move messages,\n\n433\n00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:49.320\ndo I wanna flag messages,\ndo I wanna play certain sounds?\n\n434\n00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.680\nSo you can see all the different\noptions that you can have\n\n435\n00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.630\nfrom a specific starting point.\n\n436\n00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:00.020\nAnd I will click the Move messages\nfrom someone to a folder.\n\n437\n00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:06.410\nNotice down here, it has in the Step 2 Of\nanything that is blue and has underlines.\n\n438\n00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:11.100\nThat's something that it's almost like\na field that you need to populate.\n\n439\n00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.670\nSo you have to say, well, who is it from?\n\n440\n00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:17.630\nAnd what folder do I need to\nmove it from or move it to?\n\n441\n00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:20.900\nSo you can click on\nthose different things.\n\n442\n00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.375\nAnd let me go ahead and\nmove that back out.\n\n443\n00:21:22.375 --> 00:21:24.110\nBut if I click Next.\n\n444\n00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:28.720\nBut notice it's going to go through these\nsteps for me as I click the Next, Next,\n\n445\n00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.830\nNext button.\n\n446\n00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.710\nOkay so what are the conditions\nthat you want to check?\n\n447\n00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.650\nI do want it to be from people.\n\n448\n00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.440\nAnd this is where you\ncould add multiple things.\n\n449\n00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.060\nLike maybe I want it to be,\nit comes from Lance and\n\n450\n00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:43.980\nit has to say meeting or\nsomething to that effect.\n\n451\n00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.980\nOr the important flag is checked off.\n\n452\n00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.660\n&gt;&gt; Correct, so there's a,\nyou have to set the criteria or\n\n453\n00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.460\nconditions that this rule must adhere to.\n\n454\n00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:56.580\nAnd if it doesn't meet these,\nthen it's not going to run it.\n\n455\n00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.720\nSo I'm gonna say yes,\nI want it from this specific person.\n\n456\n00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.850\nLet's come down in here.\n\n457\n00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:02.700\nWho do I want it from?\n\n458\n00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.570\nI want it from Lance Bass.\n\n459\n00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:07.870\nThat's my one thing that I wanna do.\n\n460\n00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:08.430\nClick Next.\n\n461\n00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.750\nWhat do I want to do with this message?\n\n462\n00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:14.010\nI do wanna move it to a specific folder.\n\n463\n00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:17.290\nAnd of course,\nadding other things if I wanted to.\n\n464\n00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:18.720\nAssign a category.\n\n465\n00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.540\nMaybe that's where I had it from Lance,\nand it's talking about directors.\n\n466\n00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.113\nI think I just switched my\ncriteria in the middle but.\n\n467\n00:22:25.113 --> 00:22:27.673\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Directors, and that's always gonna\n\n468\n00:22:27.673 --> 00:22:32.290\nbe flagged with an orange category\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna keep it simple.\n\n469\n00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:33.170\n&gt;&gt; Well, and this is typically where\n\n470\n00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:36.350\nI see a lot of people get in trouble\nwhen they try to create their own rules.\n\n471\n00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.490\nAnd they're like, I don't understand\nwhy this isn't working, or\n\n472\n00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:40.090\nsomething's not working correctly.\n\n473\n00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:42.040\nIs you have the options,\nyou're in the step up top.\n\n474\n00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.421\nAnd then the options for\nthat step show up down below.\n\n475\n00:22:44.421 --> 00:22:45.370\nMm-hm.\n\n476\n00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:47.162\nTo click on those clickable items.\n\n477\n00:22:47.162 --> 00:22:49.370\nYes.\nAnd put something there.\n\n478\n00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:50.910\nOtherwise, you're not\nreally doing anything.\n\n479\n00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:52.084\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like, well, yeah.\n\n480\n00:22:52.084 --> 00:22:53.814\nThe specify folder of Lance.\n\n481\n00:22:53.814 --> 00:22:56.234\nIt's like, well,\nyou said that out of your mouth.\n\n482\n00:22:56.234 --> 00:22:56.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n483\n00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:59.030\nthe computer does not understand English.\n\n484\n00:22:59.030 --> 00:22:59.538\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yet.\n\n485\n00:22:59.538 --> 00:23:00.453\n[LAUGH]\n\n486\n00:23:00.453 --> 00:23:00.981\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n487\n00:23:00.981 --> 00:23:04.300\n[LAUGH] So we have to specify the folder.\n\n488\n00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:09.680\nAnd we are going to put it into our Lance\nfolder that we created as a subfolder\n\n489\n00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.920\noff of our inbox when we were\nin that organization episode.\n\n490\n00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.310\nSo I'm choosing that.\n\n491\n00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.900\nPerfect.\n\n492\n00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.110\nClick Next.\n\n493\n00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:19.780\nI like this, Exceptions.\n\n494\n00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:23.550\nWhat if it was with somebody else, or\n\n495\n00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:27.510\nthere was other words that were\nattached to his particular email?\n\n496\n00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:30.820\nYou can start making exceptions for\nyour rules in this step.\n\n497\n00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:34.900\nNow, if you don't have any exceptions,\nthen you don't check any of them off.\n\n498\n00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.960\nBecause it does say, if necessary.\n\n499\n00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.140\nIn this particular example,\nit's not necessary.\n\n500\n00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.610\nSo we move on to the next.\n\n501\n00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:45.210\nIt says,\nwhat do you want to name this rule?\n\n502\n00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:47.630\nAnd we'll just say Lance Bass Move.\n\n503\n00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.192\nAnd, the next one, step two.\n\n504\n00:23:51.192 --> 00:23:52.581\nYou could turn on this rule.\n\n505\n00:23:52.581 --> 00:23:56.106\nAnd then it will go on from this\nday forward or this time forward.\n\n506\n00:23:56.106 --> 00:23:58.917\nEverything will go ahead and\nstart applying that rule.\n\n507\n00:23:58.917 --> 00:24:03.217\nBut nothing past or\nin the past will have that rule,\n\n508\n00:24:03.217 --> 00:24:09.085\nunless you tell it to run this rule\non message already in the inbox.\n\n509\n00:24:09.085 --> 00:24:12.653\nWow, that's sounds like a really\neasy quick way to just [SOUND].\n\n510\n00:24:12.653 --> 00:24:14.469\nYeah, I like rules.\n\n511\n00:24:14.469 --> 00:24:18.000\nI like that, cuz I start getting\nemails from certain people, and\n\n512\n00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.410\nI might not even think\nabout it until a month in.\n\n513\n00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:22.767\nIt's like, my gosh, do you know how many?\n\n514\n00:24:22.767 --> 00:24:24.540\n&gt;&gt; And they completely\noverwhelmed you with email.\n\n515\n00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.648\nAnd you're like, I need to organize this.\n\n516\n00:24:26.648 --> 00:24:31.442\nLet me go either do this all manually,\nor let's use one of these cool rules.\n\n517\n00:24:31.442 --> 00:24:35.101\nAnd then, you're like, well now I'm\nstuck with it'll work from now on.\n\n518\n00:24:35.101 --> 00:24:39.540\nBut no, they haven't got a little\ncheckbox and say, ah-ha, I can do it.\n\n519\n00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.030\nFrom prior till now, forward.\n\n520\n00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.630\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I love that line.\n\n521\n00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:45.340\nSo we're gonna check this on just\nbecause it sounds like fun, and\n\n522\n00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.840\nI wanna see how it works.\n\n523\n00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:47.639\nSo click Finish.\n\n524\n00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.910\nNotice that, I was bringing up the tap.\n\n525\n00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:53.510\nThis is where I was at before.\n\n526\n00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:56.600\nSo definitely check that out,\nit's in the show notes.\n\n527\n00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.590\nClick OK, let it do its thing,\ncuz it is kinda moving some stuff around.\n\n528\n00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:06.050\nLet's come back over into our Mailbox,\nand notice,\n\n529\n00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:10.250\nthat Lance, and you're like well did,\nI'm like, wait, did it work?\n\n530\n00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:14.030\nYes, it did,\nbecause I'm not in the inbox right now.\n\n531\n00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:16.550\nIf I look at my main inbox,\nI was already in Lance's folder.\n\n532\n00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:17.595\n&gt;&gt; You're like what's going on?\n\n533\n00:25:17.595 --> 00:25:20.740\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nthere are a few other things from Lance,\n\n534\n00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.110\njust to let you know, but\nthis is a little different.\n\n535\n00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.690\nCuz we're like, well,\nthere's something from Lance.\n\n536\n00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:26.760\n&gt;&gt; But\nit didn't meet all the criteria you said.\n\n537\n00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.930\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and this is not just from Lance.\n\n538\n00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:33.325\nThis is Lance from a group,\nso different, yeah.\n\n539\n00:25:33.325 --> 00:25:35.722\nI didn't make that exception, or\n\n540\n00:25:35.722 --> 00:25:41.080\nI didn't put that in like you have to\ninclude him being sent from his group.\n\n541\n00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.060\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n542\n00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:42.800\n&gt;&gt; Groups are different.\n\n543\n00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.934\nWe've got an episode on that too.\n\n544\n00:25:43.934 --> 00:25:47.154\nBut if I come over here\nto the Lance inbox,\n\n545\n00:25:47.154 --> 00:25:51.114\nlook at all of the messages\nfrom Lance are in there.\n\n546\n00:25:51.114 --> 00:25:55.765\nAnd notice that I have the little bold\nnumbers off to the right-hand side to let\n\n547\n00:25:55.765 --> 00:26:00.090\nme know how many unread messages I\nhad in that particular subfolder.\n\n548\n00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:03.400\nSo just to see if this is gonna work,\nif I come back over here.\n\n549\n00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.780\nI didn't turn Lance back on.\n\n550\n00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.280\nLet's see if I-\n&gt;&gt; Fortunately, it doesn't take long.\n\n551\n00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:12.075\n&gt;&gt; We say that and I'll mess it up and\nit'll take forever.\n\n552\n00:26:12.075 --> 00:26:13.521\n&gt;&gt; Vonne can't type a password.\n\n553\n00:26:13.521 --> 00:26:14.187\n&gt;&gt; Let's see.\n\n554\n00:26:14.187 --> 00:26:15.270\n&gt;&gt; You can do it.\n\n555\n00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.181\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, first try.\n\n556\n00:26:16.181 --> 00:26:18.292\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n\n557\n00:26:18.292 -->

00:26:26.896\nthe background, to try to keep myself\norganized like I've done before.\n\n561\n00:26:26.896 --> 00:26:28.895\nWe'll come over to our new mail.\n\n562\n00:26:28.895 --> 00:26:30.722\nI

and\n\n581\n00:27:15.551 --> 00:27:17.890\nwe will click Send.\n\n582\n00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:18.872\nSo now Lance has sent,\n\n583\n00:27:18.872 --> 00:27:21.529\nI can see that it did send down\nat the status bar at the bottom.\n\n584\n00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:23.090\nI'll come over here.\n\n585\n00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:26.460\nI know it works, or it did work,\nbecause before it said four,\n\n586\n00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.660\nand now look at the number over at Lance.\n\n587\n00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:29.220\n&gt;&gt; It says five.\n\n588\n00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:33.260\n&gt;&gt; It says five, and there is my,\ncome on, come on, scroll on up.\n\n589\n00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:37.180\nThere is my test,\nwe know the rule works, wonderful.\n\n590\n00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.790\nBut what if I didn't want\nthat rule to happen any more?\n\n591\n00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.830\nYou can go back over and\nturn your rules off.\n\n592\n00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:44.770\nSo that's sometimes we have to\nremember how many rules you've set.\n\n593\n00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:47.454\nAnd maybe you don't want\nthat to happen any more, so\n\n594\n00:27:47.454 --> 00:27:49.774\nyou can come back into your rules and\nalerts.\n\n595\n00:27:49.774 --> 00:27:52.189\nAnd I can take this,\nand I can delete this.\n\n596\n00:27:52.189 --> 00:27:54.803\nAnd I will say,\ndo you want to delete this rule?\n\n597\n00:27:54.803 --> 00:27:57.873\nAnd I can say, yes, and\nit will stop doing that.\n\n598\n00:27:57.873 --> 00:28:00.234\n&gt;&gt; Can also uncheck it,\nwhich will disable it.\n\n599\n00:28:00.234 --> 00:28:01.715\nSo it will still be there.\n\n600\n00:28:01.715 --> 00:28:05.908\nYou're like, I'm not sure if I\nwanna fully get rid of it yet.\n\n601\n00:28:05.908 --> 00:28:08.482\nI wanna test the waters,\nsee how my life goes.\n\n602\n00:28:08.482 --> 00:28:10.075\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not having it around.\n\n603\n00:28:10.075 --> 00:28:13.406\nIf it goes fine, then you can\ndelete it later, but if it doesn't,\n\n604\n00:28:13.406 --> 00:28:15.798\njust rechecking it and\nit starts to work again.\n\n605\n00:28:15.798 --> 00:28:18.360\nNow one way I like to\nactually create a rule is,\n\n606\n00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:22.520\ncuz I hate having to go through that and\ngo, okay, what I do need to do here?\n\n607\n00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.390\nWhat do I need there?\n\n608\n00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:28.410\nJust as email comes in, I can right-click\nfrom the sender and say, create rule.\n\n609\n00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:32.830\nAnd just, it's so much easier just to\ncreate a rule straight out of the gate.\n\n610\n00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:35.220\n&gt;&gt; That's a great point to bring up.\n\n611\n00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.330\nAnd, yes, you can totally do that.\n\n612\n00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:40.410\nIf I have an email in here,\nI'm Joey right now,\n\n613\n00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:45.620\nmaybe I wanted to make a rule just like\nLance's to go JT goes into the JT folder.\n\n614\n00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.850\nNow I already made the folder over here.\n\n615\n00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:52.042\nAnd again, we can do way more things than\njust move it to a folder as you saw.\n\n616\n00:28:52.042 --> 00:28:59.245\nBut hey, Justin Timberlake, that's kind of\ntriggering me like I wanna organize him.\n\n617\n00:28:59.245 --> 00:29:04.350\nRight-click on it and you can go\nright to your rules, there it is.\n\n618\n00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:08.630\nAnd I like to always move messages from,\nwell, it says, Lance Bass, why is this?\n\n619\n00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:09.168\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because you're Lance.\n\n620\n00:29:09.168 --> 00:29:11.904\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] well,\nif you look at the title,\n\n621\n00:29:11.904 --> 00:29:14.850\nLance Bass on behalf of Justin Timberlake.\n\n622\n00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:18.410\nThis is getting into-\n&gt;&gt; The multiple, yeah.\n\n623\n00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:21.870\n&gt;&gt; A future episode, where we're going to\nbe talking about sharing mailboxes, and\n\n624\n00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:23.855\nthat there's different delegates.\n\n625\n00:29:23.855 --> 00:29:29.175\nAnd Justin delegated Lance to\nbe able to use his mailbox.\n\n626\n00:29:29.175 --> 00:29:33.595\nSo why don't we come maybe down here to\nanother, well, I'm in Lance's folder.\n\n627\n00:29:33.595 --> 00:29:38.002\nAnd also in Lance's folder,\ngotta remember where you're at!\n\n628\n00:29:38.002 --> 00:29:38.558\n[LAUGH] Here we go.\n\n629\n00:29:38.558 --> 00:29:42.378\nSo I can go ahead and create a,\nthat's not junk, this is rules.\n\n630\n00:29:42.378 --> 00:29:43.207\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n631\n00:29:43.207 --> 00:29:48.187\nI can always move messages from Justin\nTimberlake, or I can create a rule here,\n\n632\n00:29:48.187 --> 00:29:53.807\nand it's going to already kind of give\nme some stuff from the small box here.\n\n633\n00:29:53.807 --> 00:29:57.810\nAnd I do like this one, because it doesn't\ngive you all of the here's the steps, so\n\n634\n00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.840\nmake sure you go down to that step two.\n\n635\n00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.630\nIt's kind of like the things\nthat a lot of people want to do.\n\n636\n00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:07.610\nIf the subject says,\nif it's from Justin Timberlake,\n\n637\n00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.690\nmaybe play a cute little sound\nevery time he emails you.\n\n638\n00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:13.520\nSo [LAUGH] or\nyou could move it to a folder.\n\n639\n00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.800\nSo it's some very common\nthings that people want to do.\n\n640\n00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:20.102\n&gt;&gt; Hold on, when you send stuff to\nDeleted Items, does it do bye, bye, bye?\n\n641\n00:30:20.102 --> 00:30:20.602\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n642\n00:30:20.602 --> 00:30:21.487\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Come on, right?\n\n643\n00:30:21.487 --> 00:30:22.554\nYou've gotta make that happen.\n\n644\n00:30:22.554 --> 00:30:23.507\n[LAUGH]\n\n645\n00:30:23.507 --> 00:30:24.815\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I might have to totally do this.\n\n646\n00:30:24.815 --> 00:30:25.720\n[LAUGH]\n\n647\n00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.552\n&gt;&gt; I just totally ruined her.\n\n648\n00:30:26.552 --> 00:30:27.598\n[LAUGH]\n\n649\n00:30:27.598 --> 00:30:28.429\n&gt;&gt; I'm just like!\n\n650\n00:30:28.429 --> 00:30:29.209\n[LAUGH] Okay, so\n\n651\n00:30:29.209 --> 00:30:31.609\nI'm gonna need to get the sound,\nthe song, and\n\n652\n00:30:31.609 --> 00:30:34.412\nthen I'm gonna put it into a wave file.\n&gt;&gt; We'll need copyright.\n\n653\n00:30:34.412 --> 00:30:36.418\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Yeah, okay.\n\n654\n00:30:36.418 --> 00:30:38.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n655\n00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:39.378\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, I'm already\n\n656\n00:30:39.378 --> 00:30:40.377\ndigressing.\n[LAUGH]\n\n657\n00:30:40.377 --> 00:30:41.683\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, she's losing it now.\n\n658\n00:30:41.683 --> 00:30:42.217\n[LAUGH]\n\n659\n00:30:42.217 --> 00:30:44.837\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we're doing rules, and\n\n660\n00:30:44.837 --> 00:30:47.707\nwe could go into our Advanced Options,\njust to show you that you can get right\n\n661\n00:30:47.707 --> 00:30:50.320\nback into that wizard that\nwe had started off with,\n\n662\n00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:54.360\nif you wanted to get into those different\nexceptions that we had done from before.\n\n663\n00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:58.490\nSo thank you for reminding me about\nbeing able to do the right-click.\n\n664\n00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:00.400\nThat's fine, continue anyways.\n\n665\n00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.797\nI'm going to cancel, okay, that's fine.\n\n666\n00:31:02.797 --> 00:31:03.548\nThank you.\n\n667\n00:31:03.548 --> 00:31:04.114\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's really bound and\n\n668\n00:31:04.114 --> 00:31:04.936\ndetermined to make you [CROSSTALK].\n\n669\n00:31:04.936 --> 00:31:06.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, please do this!\n\n670\n00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:06.965\n&gt;&gt; You sure?\n\n671\n00:31:06.965 --> 00:31:08.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I want to just get away,\n\n672\n00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:09.762\nso I just don't say okay.\n\n673\n00:31:09.762 --> 00:31:12.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The last thing that I wanted to\n\n674\n00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:18.160\ncover in the automation process\nis your out of office assistant.\n\n675\n00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.042\nIf you're going on vacation, and\nyou're gonna be gone for a couple of days.\n\n676\n00:31:21.042 --> 00:31:24.503\nAnd maybe you hold a position that\nyou are on your email all day long,\n\n677\n00:31:24.503 --> 00:31:29.062\nbecause that's how everybody communicates\nwith you, you should probably be nice, and\n\n678\n00:31:29.062 --> 00:31:31.430\nlet me them know that you're not there.\n\n679\n00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:33.310\nSo out of office assistant.\n\n680\n00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:36.990\nIt is in the File tab and\nit is right here, Automatic Replies.\n\n681\n00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:38.695\nOut of office.\n\n682\n00:31:38.695 --> 00:31:40.070\nWe click on this.\n\n683\n00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.006\nYou wanna set up your automatic reply so\n\n684\n00:31:44.006 --> 00:31:48.953\nthat way if somebody emails you like,\nhey, I need to talk to you now.\n\n685\n00:31:48.953 --> 00:31:53.822\nThey'll get an automatic message\nthat says, so and so, Joey,\n\n686\n00:31:53.822 --> 00:31:56.088\nor Vonne is out of the office.\n\n687\n00:31:56.088 --> 00:31:58.003\nI will be gone for this amount of time.\n\n688\n00:31:58.003 --> 00:32:02.670\nAnd that way they know that, man,\nwhy didn't she get back to me?\n\n689\n00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.029\nIt's been like five days.\n\n690\n00:32:04.029 --> 00:32:04.923\n&gt;&gt; She's a real jerk.\n\n691\n00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:05.887\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n692\n00:32:05.887 --> 00:32:07.080\n&gt;&gt; She never emailed me back.\n\n693\n00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:12.346\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let them know that, hey,\nI'm in Barcelona or whatever.\n\n694\n00:32:12.346 --> 00:32:15.970\nI'm not here, so let them know.\n\n695\n00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.272\nYou can set it up for a specific time,\ncuz that's another thing.\n\n696\n00:32:18.272 --> 00:32:19.526\nMake sure you turn your out of office.\n\n697\n00:32:19.526 --> 00:32:23.894\nBefore anything you'd have to go\ninto it and manually turn it off,\n\n698\n00:32:23.894 --> 00:32:28.280\nbesides putting are-\n&gt;&gt; Now it gives a date range.\n\n699\n00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.178\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so here we go.\nOnly sender in this range and\n\n700\n00:32:31.178 --> 00:32:33.360\nwe got one day.\n\n701\n00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.559\nInside my organization, cuz that's a nice\nthing that you can set different messages.\n\n702\n00:32:36.559 --> 00:32:41.063\nPeople inside your group, maybe the\nmarking group, you might wanna send them\n\n703\n00:32:41.063 --> 00:32:45.227\na separate message than sombody\nthat's outside of your organization,\n\n704\n00:32:45.227 --> 00:32:48.451\nsomebody maybe you don't deal\nwith on a regular basis.\n\n705\n00:32:48.451 --> 00:32:56.220\nSo you can add different messages in each\none of them, and then once you turn it on.\n\n706\n00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:57.670\nThen you can go ahead and\n\n707\n00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:02.560\njust know that anybody that emails\nyou is gonna get that, hey,\n\n708\n00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:07.150\nout of office, right there in that title,\nand that they have that indication to you.\n\n709\n00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:09.730\nBut there's other things that\nyou could do if you wanted,\n\n710\n00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:13.920\nbecause maybe when you're out of\nthe office, certain people that email you\n\n711\n00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:17.890\nreally need to be addressed, and so\nthey could be directed to somebody else.\n\n712\n00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:21.680\nMaybe if it's from this\nparticular manager,\n\n713\n00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.980\nthen make sure that that gets sent to\nmy assistant, or so on and so forth.\n\n714\n00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:29.350\nSo you can set some rules down\nat the bottom left-hand corner\n\n715\n00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:31.440\nthat apply into here.\n\n716\n00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.300\nThere is a condition and\nthen there is an action.\n\n717\n00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:39.610\nSo if you add a rule, so you could\nsee if it's from a specific person,\n\n718\n00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:43.978\nmake sure it is sent to\nthat particular person.\n\n719\n00:33:43.978 --> 00:33:46.821\nAnd you could do a lot of different\nthings in the subject and the body.\n\n720\n00:33:46.821 --> 00:33:52.411\nSo you have some other options that you\ncan set when you're out of the office,\n\n721\n00:33:52.411 --> 00:33:56.630\nand how your different inquiries\nare going to be handled.\n\n722\n00:33:56.630 --> 00:34:01.544\nSo it's very, very handy, it's very nice\nto make sure people know that you're\n\n723\n00:34:01.544 --> 00:34:05.682\nnot going to be there, and\nthat you stay up to date with everything.\n\n724\n00:34:05.682 --> 00:34:12.022\nAnd so, believe that is the last item\non my list of rules and automations.\n\n725\n00:34:12.022 --> 00:34:14.570\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne, it was very informative,\nit was very helpful for us.\n\n726\n00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:18.278\nNow we can set up all these awesome\nquick steps, that was very nice.\n\n727\n00:34:18.278 --> 00:34:19.948\nQuick steps, and what was the other?\n\n728\n00:34:19.948 --> 00:34:20.766\n&gt;&gt; Quick parts.\n\n729\n00:34:20.766 --> 00:34:23.690\n&gt;&gt; Quick parts, right?\n\n730\n00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:24.840\nNew to me, so it might be new to you.\n\n731\n00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.650\nBut very interesting thing,\n\n732\n00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:30.620\nvery helpful when it comes to\nmaking automation part of our day.\n\n733\n00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.380\nWe don't have to spend our\ntime in the minutia of,\n\n734\n00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:35.360\nI've gotta send these little emails,\nI always have to write this up.\n\n735\n00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.340\nIt makes it very easy.\nAnd then set up rules,\n\n736\n00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.890\nyou don't even have to\nbe a part of the action.\n\n737\n00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:41.560\nIt just does it,\nthat's what I definitely like.\n\n738\n00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.740\nVonne, thank you so much for today.\n\n739\n00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.410\nWe appreciate your time and\nyour effort into

watching\n\n3\n00:00:10.473 --> 00:00:15.270\nthe Outlook 2016 show where we are about\nto dive into the world of junk mail.\n\n4\n00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.969\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.939\nAnd today, to help us out and to get a\nbetter understanding on what junk mail is\n\n6\n00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.595\nand some of the other details we need\nto know about, is Ms Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:25.270\nVonne, welcome back to our studios.\n\n8\n00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.356\n&gt;&gt; Hello, good to be here, and\nwe're gonna junk it up in here.\n\n9\n00:00:28.356 --> 00:00:30.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n10\n00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.470\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna talk about junk mail.\n\n11\n00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.950\nAnd what does it mean?\n\n12\n00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.440\nHow can we control it?\n\n13\n00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.490\nAnd when do I need to be\non a good sender list or\n\n14\n00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.100\na bad sender list, and\nhow you can control it.\n\n15\n00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.973\nSo, let's start at the beginning, Ronnie.\n\n16\n00:00:43.973 --> 00:00:45.715\nWhat is junk mail?\n\n17\n00:00:45.715 --> 00:00:50.810\nIts mail that Outlook thinks is junk or\nspam,\n\n18\n00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.490\ncuz sometimes they call it a spam\nfolder or junk mail folder.\n\n19\n00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.981\nTechnically, in Outlook,\nit's labeled and says junk mail, but\n\n20\n00:00:59.981 --> 00:01:04.565\nwe always refer to it in,\nI think in everyday talk as well, as spam.\n\n21\n00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:09.549\nYou're being spammed, and\nOutlook decides who and\n\n22\n00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.652\nwhen the mail gets kinda\nseparated out into the junk.\n\n23\n00:01:14.652 --> 00:01:17.890\nSo, it's one of those things\nthat Outlook and Microsoft,\n\n24\n00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.488\nyou wanna say has control over it, because\nMicrosoft is really trying to get a little\n\n25\n00:01:22.488 --> 00:01:24.780\nbit more intelligent, if you wanna say.\n\n26\n00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.060\nIt's not necessarily, well,\n\n27\n00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.957\nI guess you could say it's a variation\nof artificial intelligence,\n\n28\n00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:38.136\nwhere your Outlook is determining what is\ngood, what is bad, what is more important.\n\n29\n00:01:38.136 --> 00:01:42.892\nThis is kind of coming down the pipeline\na little bit when we get into the focused\n\n30\n00:01:42.892 --> 00:01:47.864\nand the other mailbox and the mentions,\nI'm just mentioning it right now because\n\n31\n00:01:47.864 --> 00:01:52.070\nwe do have another episode that I\nplan to film that covers all of this.\n\n32\n00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.123\nSo it's trying to determine what is\nhelping you, it's trying to help you\n\n33\n00:01:58.123 --> 00:02:02.639\nget your mail differently, and so\nit makes those decisions for us.\n\n34\n00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:07.439\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, that's really good in terms\nof what happens as far as Outlook goes,\n\n35\n00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.960\nbut just remember,\nif you're new to emailing, right?\n\n36\n00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.360\nWe're actually past that\npart of our culture today.\n\n37\n00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.393\nAnd it's hard to believe that we're that\nfar past it where when we receive regular\n\n38\n00:02:20.393 --> 00:02:21.631\nold snail mail, right?\n\n39\n00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:26.498\nActually, mail that we get in our mailbox,\nthat you kind of ended up with a bundle\n\n40\n00:02:26.498 --> 00:02:31.890\nat times of just stuff that you just\nwent junk, junk, junk and threw it away.\n\n41\n00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.360\nAnd that's kind of the same\nanalogy in terms of junk mail\n\n42\n00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.130\ninside of our email boxes.\n\n43\n00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.630\nWell, because email is sent so\nvoluminously and\n\n44\n00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.870\ndoesn't cost anybody anything,\nwe probably get more junk\n\n45\n00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.700\nemail than we ever got real pieces\nof junk mail in our own mailbox.\n\n46\n00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.070\nYou might wonder like,\nwhy is that really bad?\n\n47\n00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.100\nThe reason why it's really bad for\na lot of companies is simple.\n\n48\n00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.900\nOut there on the Internet,\n\n49\n00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.960\nand the surveys have actually\nbeen done over the past years.\n\n50\n00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.382\nThat not just the idea of business email,\nbut\n\n51\n00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:07.345\n90 plus percent of all\nemails that are sent today,\n\n52\n00:03:07.345 --> 00:03:12.498\nevery single one that's sent is\nprobably junk mail, 90% plus.\n\n53\n00:03:12.498 --> 00:03:15.590\nNow you might go, so\nwhat's the big deal, it's junk mail.\n\n54\n00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.680\nWell, the big deal is,\nif you have a company and\n\n55\n00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.740\nthey've set up an infrastructure to build\ntheir own email server in order to handle\n\n56\n00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.900\ntheir own email for their companies,\nwell, that means that they literally put\n\n57\n00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.418\nthousands of dollars into this server to\nhandle 90% of stuff that we don't want.\n\n58\n00:03:32.418 --> 00:03:33.152\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I mean,\n\n59\n00:03:33.152 --> 00:03:36.910\nthat's a waste of resources\nis what it comes down to.\n\n60\n00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.072\nSo, the problem is simple, right?\n\n61\n00:03:39.072 --> 00:03:43.180\nAs you have to check junk mail, as Vonne\nhas to check junk mail just to make sure\n\n62\n00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.354\none of those isn't really a legitimate\npiece of email, it's wasting time and\n\n63\n00:03:47.354 --> 00:03:48.760\nproductivity.\n\n64\n00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.990\nSo, just like what Vonne explained,\nMicrosoft and Outlook, and of course,\n\n65\n00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.470\neven the servers behind it, there's some\nof that in the background that says,\n\n66\n00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.360\nlet me go ahead and prejudge this,\nand that way I'll at least mark it as\n\n67\n00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.360\nbeing junk mail, so that you're not\nreally having to worry about it too much.\n\n68\n00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.200\nIt's kind of presorted for us,\nand it shuffles it off somewhere.\n\n69\n00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.550\n&gt;&gt; And like you were kind of hinting in\nthere, sometimes, it's trying to help us,\n\n70\n00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.720\nand sending something into our junk,\nwhich is like, wait, wait,\n\n71\n00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.410\nno, that's actually real,\nI need to talk to that person.\n\n72\n00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.960\nWhat might look like a Spam or just kinda\nlike a blanket email of trying to sell\n\n73\n00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.990\nme something, that's the sales person that\nI was talking to from this particular\n\n74\n00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.520\ncompany that maybe had pushed\nout a mass marketing email.\n\n75\n00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.660\nAnd so, Outlook was starting to look at\nlike, company X is sending you a lot of\n\n76\n00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.960\njunk but you started working with company\nX, and you started working with Bob there,\n\n77\n00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.970\nand Bob is emailing you directly and\nit's like no, no, no.\n\n78\n00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.524\nNow you have to say, no, no, no,\ncome back, let's put Bob on the good list,\n\n79\n00:04:53.524 --> 00:04:54.766\nin the safe senders,\n\n80\n00:04:54.766 --> 00:04:58.921\nwhich we're going to get into of\nlooking into our different accounts.\n\n81\n00:04:58.921 --> 00:05:03.041\nAnd now, Ronnie, I know that you\nset up and administrate Office 365\n\n82\n00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:06.817\nat a higher level than what we're\ndoing in this particular show,\n\n83\n00:05:06.817 --> 00:05:08.690\nas like we are a client-level.\n\n84\n00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.125\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So, would you mind kind of expanding\n\n85\n00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:15.653\na little bit on what you could do as\nthe IT director, if you wanna say,\n\n86\n00:05:15.653 --> 00:05:20.730\nof managing our little system, as opposed\nto Outlook doing it itself but then\n\n87\n00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.840\nthere's the level of you administratively\nsetting parameters as well.\n\n88\n00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.757\n&gt;&gt; Sure thing, what normally ends up\nhappening, at least administratively,\n\n89\n00:05:29.757 --> 00:05:33.673\nis once you get your company setup and\nthe email server setup that you want to,\n\n90\n00:05:33.673 --> 00:05:36.385\nyou also have to go in and\nnow you start configuring for\n\n91\n00:05:36.385 --> 00:05:40.271\nthings like junk mail, because it really\ndoes handle a lot of information.\n\n92\n00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:44.727\nAt that level, what I can decide for\neverybody within\n\n93\n00:05:44.727 --> 00:05:49.481\nmy organization is how I want\nthe junk mail to be handled,\n\n94\n00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:56.100\nI can even configure to a point what\nwe call SCLs or spam confidence levels.\n\n95\n00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.030\nAnd that's just saying, look at this\nemail, and there's a certain type of\n\n96\n00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.480\nguideline that raised emails of whether or\nnot it's considered spam or not.\n\n97\n00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.269\nSo it's kind of weird, Vonne,\nthere's this where it's not spam at all,\n\n98\n00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:12.530\nand then it goes up to confidence\nlevel of, it's pretty much spam, and\n\n99\n00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.360\nthen a very high confidence\nlevel that it's spam.\n\n100\n00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.280\nSo, it's very strange on how this like,\nwe know that this is spam but\n\n101\n00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.260\nthen there's a high confidence\nthat there's spam as well, and\n\n102\n00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.620\nthose things I can set\nup as the administrator.\n\n103\n00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.210\nWhen we get that type of email\nthat comes into my email server,\n\n104\n00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.620\nthen it's automatically configured.\n\n105\n00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.700\nI'm not having to go through every single\npiece of email that comes through.\n\n106\n00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.540\nIt's just saying, all right,\nyou hit this level, so\n\n107\n00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.870\nit's either gonna be considered\njunk mail or it's not.\n\n108\n00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.730\nSo, every single email that\ncomes in there's gonna be\n\n109\n00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.280\na rating essentially that's put on it,\nand we're filtering it out that way.\n\n110\n00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.420\n&gt;&gt; And that we're like,\nsomeone like me as the client say,\n\n111\n00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.450\nwe're gonna do that,\nyou're the administrator, I'm the client,\n\n112\n00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.330\nI'm the one using Outlook,\nI might not even see that.\n\n113\n00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.318\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It wouldn't even be in my junk mail or\n\n114\n00:06:55.318 --> 00:06:58.740\nmy inbox or anywhere because it's\nbeing stopped like at the big gate,\n\n115\n00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.555\nwe'll call it.\n\n116\n00:06:59.555 --> 00:07:02.110\nAnd you're the gatekeeper\nof what goes through.\n\n117\n00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.630\nSo I might not even see half or even 75,\n\n118\n00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:11.405\nmaybe 90% of the spam because it is being\ncontrolled at that administrative level.\n\n119\n00:07:11.405 --> 00:07:12.700\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, that's a real good point.\n\n120\n00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.738\nThe very fact is, some of this, if not\neverything that I've just talked about\n\n121\n00:07:16.738 --> 00:07:19.674\nhere is gonna happen in\nthe background of what the users,\n\n122\n00:07:19.674 --> 00:07:21.531\nthey're not gonna experience it.\n\n123\n00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:25.148\nIt's gonna be really when the email\ncomes into the system, those\n\n124\n00:07:25.148 --> 00:07:30.100\nare the configurations and settings that\nI can put in place as an administrator.\n\n125\n00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.654\nSometimes you may even go to that point,\nor a company, excuse me,\n\n126\n00:07:33.654 --> 00:07:36.850\nmay go to the point and says, look,\nI really need a special device, and\n\n127\n00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.580\nthey can go out and\nactually buy a special device\n\n128\n00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.710\nthat handles it before it even gets to\ntheir own if they choose to as well.\n\n129\n00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.530\nSo it just depends on how your\nadministrator chooses to do that.\n\n130\n00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:48.222\nMost of the time,\n\n131\n00:07:48.222 --> 00:07:50.814\nwhen they choose it, it's because\nthis is effective as it can be.\n\n132\n00:07:50.814 --> 00:07:53.288\nAnd that's what they're\nwilling to work with, or\n\n133\n00:07:53.288 --> 00:07:56.002\nthey buy another device to\nmake it even more effective.\n\n134\n00:07:56.002 --> 00:07:56.897\nBut whatever it is,\n\n135\n00:07:56.897 --> 00:08:00.320\nit's trying to handle all that\nvoluminous amount of junk mail that.\n\n136\n00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.153\nThat gets into the system.\n\n137\n00:08:01.153 --> 00:08:05.159\nBut Vonne you do make a very good\npoint that sometimes though they\n\n138\n00:08:05.159 --> 00:08:07.470\ncan be a little bit more aggressive.\n\n139\n00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.410\nIn other words, I can be a little\nbit too aggressive at things.\n\n140\n00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.170\nBut sometimes when that happens,\n\n141\n00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:16.130\nright, is that what you start seeing\ndepending on how I set it up.\n\n142\n00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.770\nI'd mentioned this that normally\nthe way that we do it is that\n\n143\n00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.350\nwe also have a filter then we action.\n\n144\n00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.690\nIn other words, once it meets this level,\nwhere do we want it to go?\n\n145\n00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:29.030\nSo, when we have something like that at\nthe administrative side, I can say, hey,\n\n146\n00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.710\nI wanna send it to Vonne's\njunk mail folder, okay?\n\n147\n00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.300\nAnd that can be done.\n\n148\n00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.812\nOr, I might say,\nwhen it comes in at this level,\n\n149\n00:08:37.812 --> 00:08:41.252\nI want it going to\na quarantine folder instead.\n\n150\n00:08:41.252 --> 00:08:43.602\nWell, if that goes into\na quarantine folder,\n\n151\n00:08:43.602 --> 00:08:47.400\nVonne is not even gonna get a chance\nto get it onto her own computer.\n\n152\n00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.140\nIt's just gonna be put aside, and\nwaiting for me to administratively\n\n153\n00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.520\ndecide whether I'm gonna discard it or,\ndo I want to forward this on to Vonne?\n\n154\n00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.620\nSo it does make a difference,\n\n155\n00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.440\ndepending on who's managing it, and what\nthe security protocols are gonna be and\n\n156\n00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.700\nthat agreement is gonna be in terms\nof policy and how that's set up.\n\n157\n00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.830\n&gt;&gt; I remember, back at the University,\nI would even see things like,\n\n158\n00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.900\nthis has been sent to,\nI remember seeing some type of message.\n\n159\n00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:19.360\nEven at my level, as the client level,\nof like, hey, we're marking this.\n\n160\n00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.960\nAnd like you're saying,\nin administrative, l you might say, okay,\n\n161\n00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.780\nwe're looking at it, but we're still\ngonna let you, Vonne, client, see and\n\n162\n00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:32.010\nmake and determine if it really is junk or\nyou're never gonna see it.\n\n163\n00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.670\nSo if you think about me as a client and\n\n164\n00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.540\nI'm talking with Bob at Company X,\nand we're talking on the phone and\n\n165\n00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:43.480\nBob is saying, hey, I've emailed you six\ntimes, I'm like, I've never even seen it.\n\n166\n00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.850\nThis might be a situation\nwhere this has happened,\n\n167\n00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.360\nwhere up to this administrative level,\nBob's blocked.\n\n168\n00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.400\nSo I'm never even going\nto see it come to me.\n\n169\n00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.840\nSo and that's where sometimes it does\n\n170\n00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.620\ntend to get where it's out\nof our hands sometimes.\n\n171\n00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.830\nSo a lot of this that we're talking\nabout is really about scenario based.\n\n172\n00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.290\nAnd it all depends on your scenario,\nyour company set up and\n\n173\n00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.380\nwhat the parameters are, what Outlook set,\nwhat's the administrative set.\n\n174\n00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.220\nAnd now let's get into, okay, so\nwe've gotten the mail of some sort,\n\n175\n00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.900\nwhat can we do now at the client level\nto start controlling some of our spam.\n\n176\n00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.610\nSo why don't we go ahead and jump down\ninto my computer and I've got Outlook set\n\n177\n00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:28.910\nup and just a little FYI, if you've been\nfollowing along with all of our episodes.\n\n178\n00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.570\nI am Joey in this sense.\n\n179\n00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.080\nI've been JT.\n\n180\n00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.230\nWe've been Joey.\n\n181\n00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.930\nWe've been Chris.\n\n182\n00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:33.760\nWe've been Lance.\n\n183\n00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.873\nWe've gotta get JC in this mix eventually,\nso yeah.\n\n184\n00:10:36.873 --> 00:10:38.850\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're like, of course.\n\n185\n00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.815\nI know exactly who JC is [LAUGH].\n\n186\n00:10:41.815 --> 00:10:43.505\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't, but, sure.\n\n187\n00:10:43.505 --> 00:10:44.305\nWhy not, let's do it.\n\n188\n00:10:44.305 --> 00:10:46.055\n&gt;&gt; Don't worry,\nI'll be emailing JC throughout.\n\n189\n00:10:46.055 --> 00:10:47.665\nWe're planning a party for him.\n\n190\n00:10:47.665 --> 00:10:51.795\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so at the client\n\n191\n00:10:51.795 --> 00:10:57.830\nlevel, I have my inbox, and\nI do have a Junk Mail folder.\n\n192\n00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:02.630\nAnd there's actually some junk mail in\nhere cuz in this particular configuration,\n\n193\n00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.740\nI put some of the Microsoft stuff in it.\n\n194\n00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.340\nLet's jump into it.\n\n195\n00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.560\nSo, this is the folder.\n\n196\n00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.870\nWe can come in here to see\nthat guess what, Ronnie.\n\n197\n00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, look at that.\n\n198\n00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.240\n&gt;&gt; You're junk.\n\n199\n00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.940\n&gt;&gt; I am, always have been.\n\n200\n00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.160\n&gt;&gt; No you are the best, you're the prize.\n\n201\n00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.790\nI'm so glad you're here with\nme to talk about junk mail.\n\n202\n00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.180\nBut yes, we did set this up as a test.\n\n203\n00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:28.100\nAnd let's talk a little bit briefly about\nthat was at an administrative level,\n\n204\n00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:32.140\nyou were doing episodes in the Office\n365 administrative shows where\n\n205\n00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.500\nyou block yourself at that level.\n\n206\n00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's sometimes\nwhere you to test this out and\n\n207\n00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.460\nyou have to configure a couple of things.\n\n208\n00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:44.220\nBut what I did for this entire\ndomain that Vonne is working in,\n\n209\n00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.770\nis that I said,\nif it gets an email from Ronnie, me,\n\n210\n00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:52.940\nthen it automatically sends it\ninto Vonne's junk mail folder.\n\n211\n00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.380\nThat's what it's gonna be.\n\n212\n00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.370\nEarlier in an episode on the Office 365,\n\n213\n00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.360\nI even showed it where I\ncould quarantine it as well.\n\n214\n00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.750\nSo it was just showing the administrative\nside of these things here to\n\n215\n00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:04.830\nbe able to do that.\n\n216\n00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:08.400\nAnd that's really kind of the key is\nrealize that all this can be controlled.\n\n217\n00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.310\nAnd here in this instance at\nleast you're able to get it.\n\n218\n00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.450\nAnd that may be a safer bet\nthan just quarantining things.\n\n219\n00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.840\n&gt;&gt; And just to clarify,\nwhen he says Vonne, he really means Joey.\n\n220\n00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.139\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Joey, yes, sorry.\n\n221\n00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:22.826\n&gt;&gt; You're referring to me as [CROSSTALK],\nthe email that I am working with,\n\n222\n00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:24.342\nI thought she was Joey today.\n\n223\n00:12:24.342 --> 00:12:29.115\nSo yes, Joey, JT, and Lance, are all\nin the office pro-demo code domain that\n\n224\n00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:34.050\nRonnie sets up administratively and has\ncontrol over it and so that's what it is.\n\n225\n00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.310\nCuz like wait,\nVonne is not part of this domain.\n\n226\n00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:41.640\nWe keep switching personalities too,\n[LAUGH] so it's kinda hard to keep up.\n\n227\n00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.490\nSo I do have things in my junk mail and\nthis is one of those\n\n228\n00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.270\nalways check your junk mail,\none of those public service announcements.\n\n229\n00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:53.070\nYou always need to check your junk mail,\ndon't just sit in your inbox all day.\n\n230\n00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:56.630\nBecause maybe Ronnie has been emailing me,\nI have never gotten it but\n\n231\n00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:57.900\nI haven't looked at my junk mail.\n\n232\n00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.510\nSo let's just say that Ronnie is\nsomebody has gotten into here and\n\n233\n00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.570\nthen I don't want him\nto be treated as junk.\n\n234\n00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.910\nHe's a prize,\nhe needs to be in that inbox.\n\n235\n00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:13.420\nSo how can I make my client,\nmy Outlook stop treating him as junk mail?\n\n236\n00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.090\nWhen I'm in my junk mail folder,\n\n237\n00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.160\nyou can right click on the message,\nI think that's the easiest way.\n\n238\n00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.300\nThere's a couple other ways,\n\n239\n00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.270\nI believe that it's up here on\nthe Home tab of the ribbon,\n\n240\n00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.800\nyou can go the same thing that we're\ngoing to be seeing on the right click.\n\n241\n00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.210\nI like the right click cuz\nthis particular message.\n\n242\n00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.640\nIt's just personal preference.\n\n243\n00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.910\nCome down into junk and you can see we\nhave a couple different options here for\n\n244\n00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.620\nthis particular mail that\nis in the junk folder.\n\n245\n00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:44.830\nAs never block sender, that would be to\nRonnie as the sender stop blocking him.\n\n246\n00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.880\nSo anything that comes through\nfrom Ronnie, let's go ahead and\n\n247\n00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.960\nput him on that safe senders list.\n\n248\n00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.740\nI have a list, it's almost like\nthe VIP list getting into a club or\n\n249\n00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.500\nsomething like that.\n\n250\n00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.315\nLike no, I'm on the list, I really am.\n\n251\n00:13:56.315 --> 00:13:58.880\n[LAUGH] So I'm usually not on those lists.\n\n252\n00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.500\n&gt;&gt; Me neither.\n\n253\n00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.950\n&gt;&gt; But [LAUGH] we can say that I do not\nwant to ever block him as a sender.\n\n254\n00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:09.630\nThen there is a couple other levels using\nnever block the senders level domain.\n\n255\n00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:15.309\nNotice it says,\nat example.com coz Ronnie at ITProTV and\n\n256\n00:14:15.309 --> 00:14:21.466\nbasically then saying not just Ronnie but\nanybody from ITPro.TV.domain,\n\n257\n00:14:21.466 --> 00:14:27.952\nthe top level domain, well, I guess\nmid-level domain, top would be the .TV.\n\n258\n00:14:27.952 --> 00:14:28.604\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n259\n00:14:28.604 --> 00:14:33.100\n[LAUGH] just clarifying, anybody in Mike's\nProTV don't have anybody blocked there.\n\n260\n00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.930\nAnd then you can see never block\nthis group or mailing list.\n\n261\n00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:42.650\nThis would be if this was part of a\ndistribution list, if it was hosts@itprotv\n\n262\n00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:46.560\nand there was multiple people on\nthat particular, in the to field.\n\n263\n00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.560\nSo we can go ahead and\n\n264\n00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.700\nset those parameters here or\nI could keep on blocking him.\n\n265\n00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.190\nI could put him on the block senders or\nthe block list and\n\n266\n00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:01.020\nsay, yes, definitely keep him blocked,\nblocked for real.\n\n267\n00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.280\nI know that you're making\nthe judgement call right now, or\n\n268\n00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.355\nat an administrative level making\nthat judgement to get here, but\n\n269\n00:15:06.355 --> 00:15:09.420\nI'm confirming that he\nshould not be on that list.\n\n270\n00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.720\nSo you could go ahead and put that,\nlet's put him on the never block sender so\n\n271\n00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:18.040\nwe could see that he's been\nadded to my safe senders list.\n\n272\n00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.746\nWhere is that safe sender list?\n\n273\n00:15:19.746 --> 00:15:22.740\nI'm gonna right click on the email again.\n\n274\n00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.600\nYou could also come up to here\nbecause what I wanted get into for\n\n275\n00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.070\na second is the Junk email option.\n\n276\n00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:33.460\nWe can get that dialogue box up and\nwe can start looking at those pieces.\n\n277\n00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:38.490\nSo notice in the Options for\nmy Junk mail, it is saying that the level\n\n278\n00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:43.786\nof protection that I want is make sure\nthat only mail from these people or\n\n279\n00:15:43.786 --> 00:15:49.524\ndomains are my safe center or safe\nrecipients, we'll get there in a second,\n\n280\n00:15:49.524 --> 00:15:53.091\nneed to come in,\nthat was the default setting.\n\n281\n00:15:53.091 --> 00:15:58.180\nThose other settings, one of the,\nif you start getting into none, or low,\n\n282\n00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:03.268\nor high, I don't I'm not sure if I would\ncompletely advise on doing that, I\n\n283\n00:16:03.268 --> 00:16:09.030\nthink keeping those safe senders list and\nthen you go ahead and verify as needed.\n\n284\n00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:11.000\nLet's go ahead and add,\nlet go ahead and add,\n\n285\n00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.850\nI think this is going\nto keep you the safest.\n\n286\n00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.010\nBecause it's not just of what's important,\n\n287\n00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:19.700\nwhat's not important, it's also keeping\nyou safe from phishing emails and\n\n288\n00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:25.170\nanything that could be, not just spam but\nScam, we don't wanna have that area.\n\n289\n00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:28.767\nSo those are the different options\nthat you could go ahead and\n\n290\n00:16:28.767 --> 00:16:32.525\nchange, permanently deleting suspected\njunk mail instead of moving it.\n\n291\n00:16:32.525 --> 00:16:35.940\nI'm not sure if I would advise against\nthat, because that's again where\n\n292\n00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.730\nI would never even see it,\nI don't get to make that judgement call.\n\n293\n00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.040\nMy suggestion, I would probably\njust keep all the defaults,\n\n294\n00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:47.930\ncuz it does work most of the time, 90% of\nthe time, 90, probably 99% of the time.\n\n295\n00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:51.150\nPretty well,\nthere are some safe senders lists,\n\n296\n00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.480\nnotice that Ronnie has been added to this.\n\n297\n00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:58.045\nI could always go ahead and start adding\npeople from this area as well going in to\n\n298\n00:16:58.045 --> 00:17:00.320\nthe options and then adding people.\n\n299\n00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.426\nI like to kinda just do it from the mail,\nI think it's just a little bit easier, and\n\n300\n00:17:05.426 --> 00:17:10.480\nso this is saying that anybody receiving\nmy mail is, or that sender to me is safe.\n\n301\n00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.452\nNow there's also safe recipients,\nand this it gets a little,\n\n302\n00:17:13.452 --> 00:17:15.180\nit kinda gets a little confusing.\n\n303\n00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.695\nI've actually had to verify\nwith talking with you\n\n304\n00:17:18.695 --> 00:17:22.590\nthis is exactly how it worked\nbecause it's two ways.\n\n305\n00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:26.436\nThere's safe senders, there's Ronnie, and\nI can add him to the safe sender's list.\n\n306\n00:17:26.436 --> 00:17:31.730\nBut then there's also\nwhat when I send mail out\n\n307\n00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.900\nto Ronnie, that that's a safe recipient so\n\n308\n00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:39.990\nthat way I don't get treated as spam or\njunk mail to you.\n\n309\n00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.930\nCorrect, Ronnie?\n\n310\n00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:46.010\n&gt;&gt; It is, it works in that same\nvery that fashion, normally,\n\n311\n00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.630\nwhen we have something like the safe\nrecipients list, lets take for an example\n\n312\n00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:56.060\nright here at IT PRO TV that Vonne and\nI were part of the host here at IT PRO TV.\n\n313\n00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:01.500\nThere is what we call a distribution list\nfor us as well as for the other hosts.\n\n314\n00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.730\nIf Vonne chooses to go ahead and\n\n315\n00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:09.980\nsend an email to host@itprotv, I don't\nknow if that's the actual name or not.\n\n316\n00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.580\nBut if she chooses to do that,\nwell that's gonna get distributed to me\n\n317\n00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.654\nas well as to the other hosts\nindividually in our inboxes,\n\n318\n00:18:16.654 --> 00:18:19.230\nwe'll end up seeing that piece of email.\n\n319\n00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:23.920\nBut let's take, for example,\nsomething like this, Vonne sending that\n\n320\n00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.866\nemail though, and\nI have Vonne on the blocked senders list.\n\n321\n00:18:28.866 --> 00:18:34.250\nRight up there where it says block sender,\nwell now if she replied back to that\n\n322\n00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:39.660\nlist or if she sent to that list, well,\nin my own inbox it'd still be blocked.\n\n323\n00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:44.620\nSo what is happening here is that Vonne\ncan set up on her computer it says look,\n\n324\n00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:45.360\nI'm a part of this group.\n\n325\n00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.360\nIf I reply back to that particular\ngroup or if I send to that group,\n\n326\n00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:55.940\nthen Ronnie's box is also not going\nto reject me because it came from me.\n\n327\n00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:56.750\nBut it came from who?\n\n328\n00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:02.740\nIt came from that host@itprotv, so\neven though Vonne's the originator\n\n329\n00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:07.960\nof that message, the message is actually\nreally coming from that one email.\n\n330\n00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:13.550\nSo it is a little bit convoluted, and\nit's not as easy to explain as it seems.\n\n331\n00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:16.810\nBut that's the whole idea behind\nthe safe recipients is so\n\n332\n00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:20.010\nthat it doesn't intentionally\nblock her when she really,\n\n333\n00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.390\nshe might not have even\nbeen addressing it to me.\n\n334\n00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:25.463\nShe might have been addressing it to\neverybody else but me, even in that list,\n\n335\n00:19:25.463 --> 00:19:29.041\nand I was just kind of really copied\nin because I was in that group, but\n\n336\n00:19:29.041 --> 00:19:32.214\nI still need to see it and\nif I do then this doesn't block her.\n\n337\n00:19:32.214 --> 00:19:33.269\nSo that's the whole goal.\n\n338\n00:19:33.269 --> 00:19:36.607\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the way I think of it\nis like if you have senders and\n\n339\n00:19:36.607 --> 00:19:40.659\nrecipients is we have a mutual\nunderstanding between the two of us,\n\n340\n00:19:40.659 --> 00:19:44.230\nbecause it's not just mail from\none person to me coming in.\n\n341\n00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:50.000\nIt's me to that person, so it's those\nboth streets if you wanna say that\n\n342\n00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.018\nI accept you, you accept me and\nI accept your acceptance of me.\n\n343\n00:19:55.018 --> 00:19:57.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's why it's confusing.\n\n344\n00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:57.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n345\n00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.980\n&gt;&gt; So it really does take a little bit of\ntime most of us are probably not going to\n\n346\n00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:07.090\nuse this unless we're in a larger\norganization which has tons of groups and\n\n347\n00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.520\nwe happen to be a part\nof all those groups.\n\n348\n00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.900\nAnd if you're, I don't,\nI try not to send out a ton of emails, but\n\n349\n00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.830\nI know if I'm the person\nthat's getting sent a ton or\n\n350\n00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:20.400\nif I'm the one having to send a ton emails\nit could be that someone like Vonne goes,\n\n351\n00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.325\nI don't wanna see any\nmore emails from Ronnie.\n\n352\n00:20:22.325 --> 00:20:24.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But she's a part of those groups too,\n\n353\n00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.020\nI still need her to get to read my emails.\n\n354\n00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.770\nI can then add that in there and\nnow her Outlook goes, yeah,\n\n355\n00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:34.560\nit's coming from the group,\nit's not really coming from Ronnie.\n\n356\n00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:39.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah, and it really comes\ndown to, I can configure my settings.\n\n357\n00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:45.038\nRonnie or Lance or JT, whoever I'm sending\nit, they can configure their own settings,\n\n358\n00:20:45.038 --> 00:20:49.367\nso that's that whole we have our own\nsettings but in this set, we're good.\n\n359\n00:20:49.367 --> 00:20:53.928\nWe're on good terms and we're not blocked,\nwe're not on the bad list, so.\n\n360\n00:20:53.928 --> 00:20:56.920\nBut while we're talking about a bad list\nand I know there's a couple other tabs.\n\n361\n00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.150\nWe have the blocked senders,\nwhich we've touched on, let's go ahead and\n\n362\n00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:00.540\nget somebody on the blocked senders.\n\n363\n00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.520\nAnd we will come back and touch on this\ninternational tab just to make sure we\n\n364\n00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.560\nround out all the different\njunk mail options.\n\n365\n00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.460\nLet's jump into the inbox and\n\n366\n00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:12.510\ndo the scenario of somebody\nis coming in to my inbox.\n\n367\n00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.450\nAnd it knows that we're okay, like I said,\n\n368\n00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:21.270\nI really don't wanna see anymore emails\nfrom Ronnie or this person, just I need to\n\n369\n00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:26.640\nlet Outlook know to treat\nthis person as spam, as junk.\n\n370\n00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.781\nIt needs to come down and I think there's\none from me, yeah, right here, and\n\n371\n00:21:30.781 --> 00:21:34.250\nit's funny, this particular email's,\nlike you blocked me.\n\n372\n00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:38.777\nI was helping you test out those settings\nfor your show of doing the quarantines and\n\n373\n00:21:38.777 --> 00:21:39.573\neverything.\n\n374\n00:21:39.573 --> 00:21:43.181\nAnd so it's like, Ronnie's like,\nhey send me an email so\n\n375\n00:21:43.181 --> 00:21:45.990\nI can block you on\nthe administrative level.\n\n376\n00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:50.059\nAnd so we were testing this out,\nin this scenario now,\n\n377\n00:21:50.059 --> 00:21:54.630\nJoey doesn't really wanna see\nemails from Vonne anymore.\n\n378\n00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:56.410\nIt's like mm I'm done with you,\n\n379\n00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:00.640\nyou need to be blocked, same way that we\ntook our junk mail and put it to the safe.\n\n380\n00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:05.030\nWe can take our safe and send it to\nthe block, right clicking on that email,\n\n381\n00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:08.870\ncoming into our junk options and\nwe can do it, it's the same options now.\n\n382\n00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:14.480\nI can say you are going to be blocked,\nI don't want you to be here,\n\n383\n00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:19.510\nand notice that Vonne@itprotv has been\nadded to my blocked senders list,\n\n384\n00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:21.760\nthank you very much for doing that.\n\n385\n00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.385\nI have just blocked myself.\n\n386\n00:22:23.385 --> 00:22:27.361\n[LAUGH] And now I'm on the blocked email,\nif I, Vonne, sorry,\n\n387\n00:22:27.361 --> 00:22:32.628\nall these pronouns are starting to get\nconfusing, like I can't remember who I am!\n\n388\n00:22:32.628 --> 00:22:37.560\nVonne emails Joey,\nVonne will go into the spam\n\n389\n00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.484\nof Joey's mail and we go from there.\n\n390\n00:22:41.484 --> 00:22:47.074\nJumping back into the junk mail options,\nmaybe I got on Joey's good side again,\n\n391\n00:22:47.074 --> 00:22:52.170\nand I say I promise I will stop emailing\nyou pictures of sparkly rainbows,\n\n392\n00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.160\nand kittens, and bunnies.\n\n393\n00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.881\nI promise I will stop doing that,\n\n394\n00:22:55.881 --> 00:22:59.280\nokay I'll take you off\nthe blocked senders list, Vonne.\n\n395\n00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.764\nTake this and I could go ahead and\nremove it to take it,\n\n396\n00:23:02.764 --> 00:23:06.920\nand the same way that if I wanted to\nhave you not be a safe sender and\n\n397\n00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:11.730\nmaybe you and I get on bad terms, and\nmm no, you're going back down to the list.\n\n398\n00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.020\nI can control my options here.\n\n399\n00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:18.180\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, a couple of interesting buttons\nthere on the lower right hand corner where\n\n400\n00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:23.290\nit says, the Import from file and\nExport to a file, this is really neat.\n\n401\n00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:26.620\nBecause if for some reason there are 15 or\n\n402\n00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:32.340\n20 emails that Vonne really\ndoesn't ever want to hear from.\n\n403\n00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.930\nIn other words, not to get into her inbox,\n\n404\n00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:39.450\nshe doesn't have to type in\nevery single one, one at a time.\n\n405\n00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:44.110\nShe can create a file that will allow\nher to actually import all of those\n\n406\n00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:45.030\nin if she chooses to.\n\n407\n00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:49.274\nAnd that's neat because sometimes you\nmight get 50, you might get 100 of these\n\n408\n00:23:49.274 --> 00:23:53.118\nemails that you go, I really don't wanna\nhear from any of these ever again.\n\n409\n00:23:53.118 --> 00:23:56.639\nAnd I've actually done this\nthrough years Vonne, is that,\n\n410\n00:23:56.639 --> 00:24:00.440\nI exported out that list\nthat I created originally.\n\n411\n00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.122\nIt was actually Outlook Express.\n\n412\n00:24:02.122 --> 00:24:03.030\nAnd I exported it.\n\n413\n00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:07.275\nAnd then when I got into Outlook,\nI imported them back in.\n\n414\n00:24:07.275 --> 00:24:09.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I could make sure that regardless of\n\n415\n00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.212\nwhat e-mail I was on,\nI was never gonna get those e-mails again.\n\n416\n00:24:12.212 --> 00:24:12.971\n&gt;&gt; That's a great example.\n\n417\n00:24:12.971 --> 00:24:15.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's true, I did it for years.\n\n418\n00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.779\n&gt;&gt; You're carrying around\nyour black list [LAUGH].\n\n419\n00:24:17.779 --> 00:24:18.687\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I did, I did.\n\n420\n00:24:18.687 --> 00:24:20.224\n&gt;&gt; You will never get\noff this list [LAUGH].\n\n421\n00:24:20.224 --> 00:24:21.558\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n422\n00:24:21.558 --> 00:24:23.185\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a great example, and\n\n423\n00:24:23.185 --> 00:24:26.370\nI was just coming in here to\nsee that it is just a txt file.\n\n424\n00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:29.260\nAnd so if you had that list and\nyou're traveling along with it,\n\n425\n00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:33.190\nit's then usually separated out by\nmaybe commas or semicolons or enters.\n\n426\n00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:34.700\n&gt;&gt; And this stuff is just in email.\n\n427\n00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:39.840\nSo all you have to to is type in eGMail\non each line, and it just pulls it in.\n\n428\n00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:44.028\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's a character term, it's\nseparated by, there has to be some type of\n\n429\n00:24:44.028 --> 00:24:47.800\na delimiter or a separator of this,\nthe beginning and end of an e-mail.\n\n430\n00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:48.708\nSo just an enter, import it.\n\n431\n00:24:48.708 --> 00:24:51.475\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's a great example.\n\n432\n00:24:51.475 --> 00:24:53.000\n[LAUGH] I really like that.\n\n433\n00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.380\nBecause-\n&gt;&gt; Shows you how petty I really am.\n\n434\n00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think it's genius, honestly.\n\n435\n00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.270\nI'm like why didn't I do that?\n\n436\n00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:05.660\nBecause you are setting your e-mail up on\nmultiple accounts, multiple computers.\n\n437\n00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.170\nI mean, I just finished doing that.\n\n438\n00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:10.330\nI can't tell you how many times I have had\nto build virtual machines in the last two\n\n439\n00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:12.510\nweeks because I had a computer die,\nand then it came back, and\n\n440\n00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:13.300\nthen I got an old one.\n\n441\n00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:17.440\nSo, I know exactly,\nI think I have set up Joey and JT and\n\n442\n00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.980\nLance's inboxes at least\nseven times [LAUGH].\n\n443\n00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.566\n&gt;&gt; Practice makes perfect [LAUGH].\n\n444\n00:25:22.566 --> 00:25:27.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, so that's a great\nexample of those different buttons and\n\n445\n00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:32.360\nwhy we wanna bring our white list and our\nblack list, and our good and our bad list.\n\n446\n00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.880\nAnd, nope, we're good.\n\n447\n00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.990\nAll right, perfect.\n\n448\n00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:39.110\nLet's go over to that last tab and\ntalk about the international tab.\n\n449\n00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:46.997\nWhen we're blocking or adding Ronnie onto\nthe safe senders list, I said @itpro.tv.\n\n450\n00:25:46.997 --> 00:25:50.741\nAnd I corrected myself cuz I started\nsaying top level domain, and then wait,\n\n451\n00:25:50.741 --> 00:25:52.948\nthat's not actually not\na top level domain.\n\n452\n00:25:52.948 --> 00:25:57.998\nThe .tv is the top, and\nthe ITPro is the sub-domain,\n\n453\n00:25:57.998 --> 00:26:01.280\ncalled the middle domain, but we go here.\n\n454\n00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.370\nIn this tab,\nyou could block whole countries.\n\n455\n00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:08.350\nLike dot we have examples here .ca,\n\n456\n00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:12.192\nI wouldn't wanna block anybody from\nCanada I got a lot of friends in Canada.\n\n457\n00:26:12.192 --> 00:26:15.960\n[LAUGH] Or different countries\nthat I could block here.\n\n458\n00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:21.280\nThe thing is, if you start blocking at\nthis top level, you're going to the top\n\n459\n00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:27.590\nand so you're filtering out a whole bunch\nof stuff that could be completely valid.\n\n460\n00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:30.490\nAnd so,\nI don't how much you wanna get into this,\n\n461\n00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:33.910\nbut at least you know that\nyou do have this option.\n\n462\n00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:39.060\nYou could block everything from .biz,\nis that, that's a, yeah, .biz.\n\n463\n00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.360\nDon't ever want that,\nforever whatever reason.\n\n464\n00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.250\nYou probably won't wanna\nblock a .com though, right?\n\n465\n00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:44.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be pretty bad.\n\n466\n00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:45.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And if you think about it,\n\n467\n00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.200\nthis makes sense.\n\n468\n00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:52.010\nAnything that ends in these domains,\ndot, whatever, .gov, dot whatever, well,\n\n469\n00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:56.290\nif you block that, that means every e-mail\naddress, it doesn't matter who it is,\n\n470\n00:26:56.290 --> 00:27:01.680\nit's gonna get blocked if it ends in\nthat particular .com, .gov, .whatever.\n\n471\n00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:08.100\nSo realize that this can really stop you\nfrom giving all e-mails very quickly.\n\n472\n00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.420\nAnd you might be wondering why the heck\nwould they allow us to do this?\n\n473\n00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.750\nIt's because Outlook knows something.\n\n474\n00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:17.440\nYou may be running this in\na domain like Office 365,\n\n475\n00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.780\nwhere you're in control\nof the organization.\n\n476\n00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.910\nAnd that may be perfectly legitimate and\nvalid to do so.\n\n477\n00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:24.650\nBut also, you may not be.\n\n478\n00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:28.150\nAnd so, they wanna give you that power and\nthat option.\n\n479\n00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:31.260\nEven if you're running just from\nyour own standalone computer and\n\n480\n00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.410\nyou're getting tired of getting\nthese e-mails that's telling you,\n\n481\n00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:38.910\nplease buy this land over here in our\ncountry and whatever it might be.\n\n482\n00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:41.520\nAnd you're like I don't really\nwanna see those e-mails.\n\n483\n00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.970\nYou can block those types of domain lists,\ntoo.\n\n484\n00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:47.760\nBut you gotta be careful, especially if\nyou block something that you know you're\n\n485\n00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.540\nnormally receiving e-mails from.\n\n486\n00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.780\nSo most of us are probably never\ngoing to adjust anything like this.\n\n487\n00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.940\nIf it's done in an organization, that's\nprobably done at the administrative level,\n\n488\n00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.460\nnot so\nmuch at the individual computer level.\n\n489\n00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.010\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, great.\n\n490\n00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:02.950\nAnd so,\nI think the moral of the story is this is,\n\n491\n00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:07.030\nit's all dependent on every single piece.\n\n492\n00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:12.780\nOutlook, administrative, client, and then\nyou have client to client and making sure\n\n493\n00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:17.460\nwe're okay and we're both on the good\nsenders, and whether or not I see it.\n\n494\n00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.880\nAnd, I mean,\nif there is somebody like I don't\n\n495\n00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.720\nknow why I am not getting your e-mail,\ncall your IT.\n\n496\n00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.046\nThey are like, well,\nwe can't change that parameter.\n\n497\n00:28:27.046 --> 00:28:30.250\nThen, hey, Bob, from company x,\ndo you have a Gmail?\n\n498\n00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:33.420\nCan you just go ahead and start\ne-mailing me from your Gmail account or\n\n499\n00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.280\nsomething else?\n\n500\n00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.968\nI can't get you off of\nthe blocked sender's list.\n\n501\n00:28:37.968 --> 00:28:41.690\nBecause there are certain things\nthat will be out of your control.\n\n502\n00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:45.170\nBut at least hopefully in this episode\nthat we've given you a nice overview\n\n503\n00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:47.640\nof the different pieces so\nyou have a better understanding.\n\n504\n00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.460\nIt's one of those, sometimes it's out\nof our hands, we can't control it.\n\n505\n00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:56.240\nBut if we understand why,\nit makes it a little easier for us.\n\n506\n00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.130\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne,\nwell, thank you again for\n\n507\n00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:01.370\nhelping us out to understand a little\nbit more about the junk mail and\n\n508\n00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:05.290\nsome of the settings that we can\ncontrol right from Outlook as well.\n\n509\n00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:09.330\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to also sign off for this episode.\n\n510\n00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:12.090\nFor OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n511\n00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:13.010\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n512\n00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:17.204\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore

ProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.490\nI am your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n4\n00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.017\nAnd today, we're going to be talking\nabout setting up our mailbox archive.\n\n5\n00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.110\nAnd here to help us is Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.214\nHello, Ronnie.\n\n7\n00:00:20.214 --> 00:00:21.480\nHow are you doing, Vonne?\n\n8\n00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.269\nI'm doing great, and\nwe've switched roles a little bit here.\n\n9\n00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.572\nWe have, just a little bit.\n\n10\n00:00:25.572 --> 00:00:27.758\nYes, yes, so\nif you've watched some other episodes,\n\n11\n00:00:27.758 --> 00:00:29.301\nwe're on the other sides of the table.\n\n12\n00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:33.249\nBut, I wanted to bring you\nin on this specific episode,\n\n13\n00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:36.556\nbecause you know a lot\nabout archiving email.\n\n14\n00:00:36.556 --> 00:00:41.528\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] So I wanted you to tell\nall the great folks out there exactly,\n\n15\n00:00:41.528 --> 00:00:44.140\nwhat is archiving, where should we start?\n\n16\n00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.774\nWhen it comes down to\nthe idea of archiving email,\n\n17\n00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:51.490\nwe need to make sure that we understand,\nwell, a couple of things, right?\n\n18\n00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.760\nOne, why do we want to\nactually archive email, and\n\n19\n00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.040\nof course, two, what is archiving about,\nand what's the whole purpose behind it?\n\n20\n00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.950\nThe answer of course, it doesn't matter\nwhich order you actually answer them in.\n\n21\n00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:04.970\nYou have to have both,\n\n22\n00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.750\nif you wanna effectively do this,\nbecause it doesn't make sense\n\n23\n00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.450\nto archive something if you don't know\nthe reason why you're doing it as well.\n\n24\n00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.960\nWhen it comes down to,\nwhat archiving is that?\n\n25\n00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.360\nArchiving at least for\nemails allows us to be able to\n\n26\n00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.870\nunclutter, or declutter our inboxes.\n\n27\n00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.760\nAnd the whole goal and\nidea behind that is,\n\n28\n00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.530\nthat the more emails that\nyou end up getting, and\n\n29\n00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.050\nthe more that your mailbox builds up\nthose emails that are inside of it.\n\n30\n00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.980\nEven searchability becomes a little\nbit more challenging old stuff\n\n31\n00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.000\ngets mixed in with new stuff, and\nwhen you're trying to find something, and\n\n32\n00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.310\nyou get a lot of results instead of pin\npointing exactly the result that you want,\n\n33\n00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.060\nwell, archiving helps us to fix that.\n\n34\n00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.400\nAnd the way that it actually helps us\nto fix that is, by simply moving those\n\n35\n00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.050\nemails into another folder, really\nis technically what we end up doing.\n\n36\n00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.420\nBut it allows us to kinda\nmove them off to the side\n\n37\n00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.770\nto where those are still searchable,\nif we choose to make them searchable.\n\n38\n00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.270\nBut now we're not getting rid of them\nmy deleting them, we're not actually\n\n39\n00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.930\nremoving them out of the realm of\nreachability anymore, but we're simply\n\n40\n00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.170\nsetting them aside to be stored, that way\nwe're not actually losing any information.\n\n41\n00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.600\nI mean, when I think of the word archive,\nI think of a museum.\n\n42\n00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.787\nOr for some reason,\nIndiana Jones is coming into my mind.\n\n43\n00:02:28.787 --> 00:02:33.460\nAnd we're gonna go search the archives\nto find out what we're looking for.\n\n44\n00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.500\nNo, that's actually a great idea, because\nit does have to do with the history and so\n\n45\n00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.510\nIndiana Jones ties right in.\n\n46\n00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.110\nThe idea of archives is that,\nit gives us a historical\n\n47\n00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.120\nability to go backward in time when\nwe need to, and that's the key.\n\n48\n00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.540\nIf we keep everything in our\nmailbox inside of our inbox,\n\n49\n00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.710\nIt gives us great searchability like\nwe said, but the problem in timeliness,\n\n50\n00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.790\nit's context in what we need them for.\n\n51\n00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.440\nWe don't want to return a bunch of\nsearches from three years ago, if I'm only\n\n52\n00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.570\nlooking for an email that's a year, or\nmaybe six months, or three months ago.\n\n53\n00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.600\nInstead I might go, I know it's within\nthe last month or so, but now I'm\n\n54\n00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.838\ngetting results from six years ago, and\nthat's something we really don't want.\n\n55\n00:03:14.838 --> 00:03:18.860\nAnd this, this something with a mailbox\nsize come into play with this,\n\n56\n00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.580\ncuz I remember working in the university.\n\n57\n00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.560\nWe had specific mailbox sizes, and\nthey would always say something about\n\n58\n00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.210\narchiving, and I understood what archiving\nwas, but it happened automatically.\n\n59\n00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.500\nIs that something tied into archive?\n\n60\n00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.720\nYes, it really can be,\n\n61\n00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.900\ndepending on the way that your\norganization has your inboxes setup.\n\n62\n00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.370\nYou're given a certain amount of,\nwell, space, right,\n\n63\n00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.910\nso that you can have your email\nstorage up there and ready to go.\n\n64\n00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.112\nThat space is limited.\n\n65\n00:03:47.112 --> 00:03:48.250\nThe larger organization,\n\n66\n00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.710\nthe more people that you have, you're\nonly gonna be afforded so much space.\n\n67\n00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.400\nSome people get a ton more\nemail than others do.\n\n68\n00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.860\nAnd the way to keep that stuff\nreally down to certain sizes,\n\n69\n00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.396\nis by moving off emails that\nare not as important or\n\n70\n00:04:06.396 --> 00:04:10.296\nnot as timely now into an archival system.\n\n71\n00:04:10.296 --> 00:04:16.058\nThat way, we can keep our current inbox\nas a separate sized mailbox that we have,\n\n72\n00:04:16.058 --> 00:04:19.190\nand we're never really filling it up.\n\n73\n00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.037\nSo the archive essentially extends the\ncapacity that we have to have emails, but\n\n74\n00:04:24.037 --> 00:04:28.740\nits really not growing at a tremendously\nquick rate such as our regular inbox is\n\n75\n00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.398\ngonna be.\n\n76\n00:04:29.398 --> 00:04:34.320\nAnd is it safe to assume that our\norganization could set up the archiving\n\n77\n00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.902\nfor us?\n\n78\n00:04:34.902 --> 00:04:39.708\nAnd does that something maybe as an end\nuser in a large organization that,\n\n79\n00:04:39.708 --> 00:04:44.049\nI wouldn't necessarily always need\nto do an actionable item, but\n\n80\n00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:48.954\nunderstanding what it's doing is probably,\nmaybe all I might need to do.\n\n81\n00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:52.144\nAnd then maybe in the second level,\nif I do need to archive it myself,\n\n82\n00:04:52.144 --> 00:04:54.340\nis that what we're going to be covering?\n\n83\n00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.320\nYeah, there's a couple of things, right?\n\n84\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.720\nSo, depending on your organizations and\na couple of, you hate to say this,\n\n85\n00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.480\nsecurity needs that are out there.\n\n86\n00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.260\nAnd also,\nlegal needs that are out there as well.\n\n87\n00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.540\nThe very fact is, if you're part of\nan organization and it deals with say\n\n88\n00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.700\npublicly traded data and\nstuff like that, or healthcare or\n\n89\n00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.710\nanything like that, where you're\nhandling other people's information.\n\n90\n00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.662\nMore than likely, archiving is gonna\nbe a part of everything that you do,\n\n91\n00:05:23.662 --> 00:05:26.850\nbecause they're gonna want if\nthey get sued at some point,\n\n92\n00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.427\nto be able to back and\nsearch that information.\n\n93\n00:05:29.427 --> 00:05:32.130\nAnd you might go, well,\nI just deleted that.\n\n94\n00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.750\nMore than likely,\n\n95\n00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.000\nthere's gonna be something that is set\nup on the administrative side that says,\n\n96\n00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.870\nyou're not really deleting.\n\n97\n00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.922\nOr we're kind of moving all that\nstuff out to the back Instead.\n\n98\n00:05:39.922 --> 00:05:43.694\nSo auto archiving or some of the features\nthat are there, they can be set up that\n\n99\n00:05:43.694 --> 00:05:48.060\nway where they're all maply archived, and\neven for legal holds too, is possible.\n\n100\n00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.130\nYeah, I mean, working at a university,\n\n101\n00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.080\nI remember they were always kind of,\nI wanna say drilled down to our heads.\n\n102\n00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.830\nIt really make sure we understand that,\n\n103\n00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.730\nanything that you do is the property\nof the university, Right.\n\n104\n00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.070\nAnd, it really profits the state,\nI mean, it's a government institution.\n\n105\n00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.836\nEverything that is sent back and\nforth in email, it's stored,\n\n106\n00:06:06.836 --> 00:06:08.589\nwhether you delete it or not.\n\n107\n00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:12.570\nBut that was again, like you said, it's\nup higher in the administrative settings,\n\n108\n00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.540\nif you wanna say.\n\n109\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.468\nSo, I just had to make sure I understood,\nthat it's never really gone, and\n\n110\n00:06:18.468 --> 00:06:19.549\nso it's there.\n\n111\n00:06:19.549 --> 00:06:20.783\nAnd that makes sense, right?\n\n112\n00:06:20.783 --> 00:06:24.198\nOrganizations need that to happen because\nif you're operating as an agent of\n\n113\n00:06:24.198 --> 00:06:25.149\nthat organization.\n\n114\n00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:27.220\nYou're a sales person for\nthat organization,\n\n115\n00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.070\nyou're representing a department for\nthat organization, whatever it is.\n\n116\n00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.186\nIt can come a time when they're\ngonna call upon you perhaps,\n\n117\n00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:38.737\nif it's a legal kind of issue,\nwhere they'll say,\n\n118\n00:06:38.737 --> 00:06:43.276\nI need every single piece of email\nthat mentions so and so's name.\n\n119\n00:06:43.276 --> 00:06:47.508\nAnd that's not only for what's inside\nof bonds on personal mailbox, but\n\n120\n00:06:47.508 --> 00:06:50.960\nit could be across the entire\norganization as well.\n\n121\n00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.776\nSo, getting the archive features set up,\ngetting some of these other features set\n\n122\n00:06:54.776 --> 00:06:59.470\nup, goes hand in hand because that way,\nwe can continue to have storage and\n\n123\n00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.860\nto get every email out there that's\navailable the last ten years or\n\n124\n00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.400\nwhatever it might be,\nto be ready to go and to be set up.\n\n125\n00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.900\nBut Vonne's right,\nsometimes we're not in that organization.\n\n126\n00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.050\nThe very fact is, you may connect in and\ngo, look, I'm not really a part of that.\n\n127\n00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.750\nSo it's not gonna be set up for\nyou automatically.\n\n128\n00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.710\nAnd that means that, if you know that\nyou're just running Outlook on your own,\n\n129\n00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.050\nand you are connected to Office 365,\nthat's fine.\n\n130\n00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.790\nThere are some features that\nare turned on automatically but\n\n131\n00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.740\nwhere you archive, it's normally\ngonna be right on your own computer.\n\n132\n00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.390\nAnd that's what we're really gonna get\ninto is setting up the archiving feature\n\n133\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.600\nfor Outlook itself.\n\n134\n00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:40.050\nFor our local client, for our machine,\nand our information on the machine,\n\n135\n00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.740\nas opposed to the Office 365 and\nthe cloud, like all of our emails in\n\n136\n00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.030\nthe cloud, but we're really\ntalking about this, our machine.\n\n137\n00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.630\nRight, because it's the one\nthing that we can configure.\n\n138\n00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:55.534\nRegardless of whether we are connected\nto an Office 365 network itself, or\n\n139\n00:07:55.534 --> 00:08:00.290\ninfrastructure, or we're just\nconnected to Outlook, or outlook.com,\n\n140\n00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.583\nand we're still using email client and\ndoing that.\n\n141\n00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:05.143\nWhichever one it is is perfectly fine.\n\n142\n00:08:05.143 --> 00:08:12.020\nArchiving really is about how much you\nreally do need to keep your data on hand.\n\n143\n00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.470\nBusinesses again, like we said will\nprobably have security issues,\n\n144\n00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.120\nthat they're dealing with legal issues.\n\n145\n00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.780\nYou on your own, it depends on your\nbusiness and what you want to keep.\n\n146\n00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.710\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at some\nof the different ways that we can setup\n\n147\n00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.980\nsome archiving right here in Outlook.\n\n148\n00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.010\nNow, I'm actually posing\nas Lance right now.\n\n149\n00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:32.000\nAnd you can see that,\nright here at the top of the screen.\n\n150\n00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.889\nWhere it says Lance, and\nhere's his email inbox right now.\n\n151\n00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:40.557\nWhat we're going to do, is we're gonna\ntake a look at probably the most common\n\n152\n00:08:40.557 --> 00:08:43.299\noption that's actually available\nto us which is simple.\n\n153\n00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.446\nIf I click on the Home tab,\ninside the Home tab,\n\n154\n00:08:46.446 --> 00:08:50.473\nif I want to start archiving,\nI've got a couple of options.\n\n155\n00:08:50.473 --> 00:08:53.085\nProbably it's fairly easy,\nas you can see right here Vonne,\n\n156\n00:08:53.085 --> 00:08:54.700\nit's simple on the Home tab.\n\n157\n00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.680\nWithin the Delete group itself,\nnotice that there's a nice button for\n\n158\n00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.270\nus that says Archive.\n\n159\n00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.130\nAnd it really tells us\nexactly what's going on.\n\n160\n00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.380\nIt's not doing anything\nspecial to what we're doing,\n\n161\n00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.620\njust saying move to an archive folder.\n\n162\n00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.320\nMove this item to your archive folder.\n\n163\n00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.750\nNow, what does that mean?\n\n164\n00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:16.120\nIt means whatever item that you're\nactually setting up on your machine or\n\n165\n00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.980\nthat you've got selected.\n\n166\n00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.320\nSo right now I have a single\nemail selected right here.\n\n167\n00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.360\nIf I choose to,\nI can click on that particular button.\n\n168\n00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:30.810\nAnd now you'll end up seeing where\nit says Set-up One Click Archive.\n\n169\n00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.450\nWe didn't find an existing\narchiving folder.\n\n170\n00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.130\nCreate a new folder called Archive.\n\n171\n00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:40.700\nSo it allows you to say hey look, I can\ncreate a brand-new one if I haven't had it\n\n172\n00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:45.700\nsetup, or I can choose an existing\nfolder to move those emails into.\n\n173\n00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.030\nIt is up to you on how you\ndecide to set this up.\n\n174\n00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:52.370\nSo, if you don't have one,\nyou can go ahead and do this.\n\n175\n00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.770\nThe majority of times, though,\nif you take a look and\n\n176\n00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.640\nyour, what did we call this again,\nVonne, over here?\n\n177\n00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.350\n&gt;&gt; The navigation pane.\n\n178\n00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:59.840\n&gt;&gt; The navigation pane.\n\n179\n00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.435\n&gt;&gt; Or folder pane [CROSSTALK].\n\n180\n00:10:00.435 --> 00:10:01.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, folder pane.\n\n181\n00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.350\nYeah, I always call it navigation pane.\n\n182\n00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:04.244\n&gt;&gt; The thing on the left.\n\n183\n00:10:04.244 --> 00:10:05.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The thing on the left.\n\n184\n00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.350\nThat actually works, though,\ntoo most organizations,\n\n185\n00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:12.730\nwhen you do get this things setup in terms\nof archiving, you'll normally see that\n\n186\n00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:17.230\nthere's an archive folder already\nthere and you don't have to create it.\n\n187\n00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:21.320\nBut if you happen to be like on this\none where it's not there, well,\n\n188\n00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.160\nit's not gonna actually be setup.\n\n189\n00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.130\nSo if I select Create an Archive Folder,\n\n190\n00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:30.210\nnow you can notice then\nArchive folder is created.\n\n191\n00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.510\nAnd if I click in that Archive folder,\n\n192\n00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:36.100\nlet's see, Joey requested a read\nreceipt to whoever it was sent.\n\n193\n00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.378\nNo, I don't want that.\n\n194\n00:10:37.378 --> 00:10:38.794\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, that was me.\n\n195\n00:10:38.794 --> 00:10:42.472\nI was setting up for another episode and\nI sent it to you, too.\n\n196\n00:10:42.472 --> 00:10:43.963\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's fine.\n\n197\n00:10:43.963 --> 00:10:46.082\nSo now I'll just try and\nclick on the archive folder.\n\n198\n00:10:46.082 --> 00:10:50.828\nYou can now see where this latest\nemail from Justin has been sent and\n\n199\n00:10:50.828 --> 00:10:54.070\nnow it's been archived and\navailable to us.\n\n200\n00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.420\nAnd that's kind of easy enough to do.\n\n201\n00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:01.450\nNow, the great thing about this is\nnot only do I now have this setup,\n\n202\n00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:02.830\nbut you'll notice something.\n\n203\n00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.820\nNow, it's actually every single\nitem that I select here.\n\n204\n00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.120\nThe other way to do this is,\nlet me come down here,\n\n205\n00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.780\nthere's some of the older ones here.\n\n206\n00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.410\nSo if I just click on this one for\nexample, remember when I\n\n207\n00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.890\nhovered over this, I also saw that\nlittle tool tip that was available.\n\n208\n00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.120\nLet me see if I can do this again.\n\n209\n00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.260\nAnd look what's inside of\nthe parenthesis there.\n\n210\n00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.750\nIt says backspace.\n\n211\n00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.570\nWell, what does that actually mean though?\n\n212\n00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:30.410\nSo if I come back down here,\nand I'll select this one.\n\n213\n00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:35.880\nIf I just select it and then I hit\nthe backspace key, it disappears out of\n\n214\n00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:41.850\nmy inbox and I might be, did that actually\ngo to the deleted items at this point?\n\n215\n00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:42.980\nNo, it didn't.\n\n216\n00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:48.630\nIf I select archive, you'll now notice\nthat even from this past Wednesday,\n\n217\n00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.910\nit went ahead and allowed me to do that.\n\n218\n00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.790\nSo it's very quick and\neasy for most users.\n\n219\n00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.750\nYou don't have to setup a ton\nto get archiving working.\n\n220\n00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.150\nIf you can just remember\nthat if I click on email and\n\n221\n00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.340\nI look at it really quickly and go,\nI wanna send that to the archive,\n\n222\n00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.220\njust hit your backspace key and that will\nstart setting it up for you as well.\n\n223\n00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:10.580\n&gt;&gt; I've actually done this and me, being\nthe keyboard shortcut fanatic that I am,\n\n224\n00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:15.540\nI was like, why isn't this in the deleted,\nso I just did a,\n\n225\n00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.070\nI had one of those moments\nright over here off camera.\n\n226\n00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.430\nI was going,\nnow I understand where it went.\n\n227\n00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.470\nYeah and\nthis is something that's really neat.\n\n228\n00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:28.224\nRemember that if you're on a stand\nalone edition of Office 2016,\n\n229\n00:12:28.224 --> 00:12:33.948\nthat means you're not really connecting\ninto like an Office 365 organization,\n\n230\n00:12:33.948 --> 00:12:38.884\nbut let's say that you've bought\nyour subscription of Office 365.\n\n231\n00:12:38.884 --> 00:12:42.137\nYou might find it awesome that you\ndon't have some of those other\n\n232\n00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:45.510\nthings that you might see available\nsuch as online archiving.\n\n233\n00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:48.690\nIn other words, the administrator is\nsaying we're gonna archive for you,\n\n234\n00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.310\nyou're not gonna have to worry about it.\n\n235\n00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:54.880\nBut here, that's gonna probably be\nabout your only real option for\n\n236\n00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.945\nthe modern archiving that we're talking\nabout which is as easy as this,\n\n237\n00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:02.820\nit's just getting that setup\nto do what we want to do.\n\n238\n00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.540\nNow, the issue here though,\n\n239\n00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.310\nis it doesn't save us from things like\nwhat Vonne was mentioning before.\n\n240\n00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.200\nThe very fact of we're just saying, look,\n\n241\n00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.330\nto keep your mailbox\nkind of not overflowing,\n\n242\n00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:19.330\nto make sure it stays relatively small,\narchiving is what helps you here.\n\n243\n00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.390\nWell, in this instance it doesn't.\n\n244\n00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.880\nNotice in my entire folder structure,\nI just really created another folder.\n\n245\n00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.540\nI didn't move it off of the machine or\nout of the location.\n\n246\n00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.570\nI've just created another folder and\nmoved it there.\n\n247\n00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:34.930\nSo it's not gonna save me any\nparticular space that I have.\n\n248\n00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:40.050\nIn Office 2016, another advantage\nthat we have from older editions of\n\n249\n00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:45.470\narchiving that was available to us is\nthat, it remains searchable, okay?\n\n250\n00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.680\nAnd in this sense, very easily searchable.\n\n251\n00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.390\nI don't have to really do anything to it.\n\n252\n00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:56.410\nBut in older ones, if I actually\narchived only to my local machine,\n\n253\n00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.220\nit's searchable when I go, all right.\n\n254\n00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.750\nLet me make sure I also\ninclude the archive in there.\n\n255\n00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:05.230\nAnd that can become much more\ndifficult if I am disconnected from\n\n256\n00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:06.620\nthe Exchange server.\n\n257\n00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.310\nSo if I'm disconnected from my online and\nbeing able to send email, and at the lower\n\n258\n00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:15.730\nIPM corner, it says not connected or\ndisconnected, whatever it says.\n\n259\n00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.960\nI'm not gonna be able to\nsearch through my own archive\n\n260\n00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.020\non my local computer at that point.\n\n261\n00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.980\nSo here, it's doesn't reduce the size.\n\n262\n00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.420\nAnd another benefit of course,\nis that it actually remains searchable.\n\n263\n00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.070\nThat's something that\nwe want to have happen.\n\n264\n00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:34.710\nOkay, so everything actually\nworks fairly well, fairly simply,\n\n265\n00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:39.650\nit doesn't take, not a ton of\nclicks to get everything done so\n\n266\n00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:44.570\nuser should be, okay that's pretty\ncomfortable for us to be able to do.\n\n267\n00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.810\nI should be able to figure this one out.\n\n268\n00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:53.430\nBut if you're like me, okay, sometimes you\nkind of get a little a bit of click happy.\n\n269\n00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.653\nSo just like the very first time when I\nsaid this stuff, I said click that archive\n\n270\n00:14:57.653 --> 00:15:01.530\nfolder, but what if I go,\nI really didn't want that archive folder.\n\n271\n00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:04.560\nI want it to go into a different location.\n\n272\n00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.560\nWell, now that you've gone there\ncan you change the location\n\n273\n00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.620\nof where I am archiving the information?\n\n274\n00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:14.440\nCuz it doesn't seem like it really\ngives me any other choice, right?\n\n275\n00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.359\nSo let's go back to the inbox and let me\nshow you what I'm talking about here.\n\n276\n00:15:17.359 --> 00:15:21.724\nSo I come down a little bit later on,\nlook, a message about reunion tour.\n\n277\n00:15:21.724 --> 00:15:28.360\nAnd I now hit the backspace, kept\ncalling it delete here, the backspace.\n\n278\n00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.550\nWell, that works, but\nit still goes directly into archive.\n\n279\n00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:37.351\nThat's because I automatically had it\nsetup and that's what makes sense.\n\n280\n00:15:37.351 --> 00:15:40.590\nBut what if you go,\nI really didn't want it there.\n\n281\n00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:42.820\nI want it to go somewhere else.\n\n282\n00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:47.440\nNotice that even if I click on this again,\nright, let me go back to the inbox.\n\n283\n00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.256\nWe can choose another one, there we go.\n\n284\n00:15:49.256 --> 00:15:50.444\nSo even I select that,\n\n285\n00:15:50.444 --> 00:15:54.150\nnotice it didn't give me that option\nthat says, you really set it up?\n\n286\n00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.104\nWhat are you going to do?\n\n287\n00:15:56.104 --> 00:15:59.328\nBut the great thing is,\nthey don't limit you that way,\n\n288\n00:15:59.328 --> 00:16:01.258\nyou can also change this as well.\n\n289\n00:16:01.258 --> 00:16:04.474\nThe way that we do this is\nthrough the back stage area.\n\n290\n00:16:04.474 --> 00:16:07.895\nAnd that is going to file,\nif I select file and\n\n291\n00:16:07.895 --> 00:16:12.580\nonce I actually get into files\nI am now gonna scroll down.\n\n292\n00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.210\nAnd inside of our kind\nof a stage back here,\n\n293\n00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:20.480\nnotice that there is a tile called tools,\nlet me zoom out so I can get to it.\n\n294\n00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.720\nAnd this is where we have several\noptions that are available.\n\n295\n00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:30.540\nNow we're gonna talk about this item in\njust a moment, but take a look at this.\n\n296\n00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:35.173\nSet the archive folder, set destination\nfolder for quick archiving.\n\n297\n00:16:35.173 --> 00:16:39.744\nIf I select this,\nI can see currently right now exactly what\n\n298\n00:16:39.744 --> 00:16:43.957\nmy current archive folder is,\nthe one that I created.\n\n299\n00:16:43.957 --> 00:16:48.977\nBut if I wanted to, I could redirect that,\nlet's say to junk mail or\n\n300\n00:16:48.977 --> 00:16:52.248\nI can click new,\ncreate a brand new folder.\n\n301\n00:16:52.248 --> 00:16:56.874\nAnd that way I might tie it to something,\nlike this is gonna be my work archive\n\n302\n00:16:56.874 --> 00:17:00.570\nright now, or whatever it might be,\ndepartment archive.\n\n303\n00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:05.090\nI don't care, you're gonna actually be\nable to do that and then redirect all your\n\n304\n00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:10.090\nmail that you wanna archive very quickly\nby doing something just as simple as this.\n\n305\n00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:13.450\nSo you're not held down\nto just one location.\n\n306\n00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.120\nYou can change that location\nwherever you actually want to go.\n\n307\n00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.470\nAnd get that all set up and ready to do.\n\n308\n00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.380\nSo that actually does help us out.\n\n309\n00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.490\n&gt;&gt; And we're setting up these folders,\nlike the archive folder that it did for\n\n310\n00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:29.340\nus automatically, or we could go ahead,\nand like you said, make a new one,\n\n311\n00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:35.340\ncuz it's almost like we're filing it\naway to be able to put to storage.\n\n312\n00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.840\nIt's almost like we're\nputting it in a box.\n\n313\n00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.900\nThat button actually looks\nlike a little bankers box.\n\n314\n00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:39.980\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; Putting everything in,\n\n315\n00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:45.260\nand then we're gonna put it into storage\nas opposed to if we put it into the trash.\n\n316\n00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.740\nThat's like you're going\nto be thrown away.\n\n317\n00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.920\nSo it's different than being\nthrown away and being stored.\n\n318\n00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.250\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; At least that's how I'm thinking of it.\n\n319\n00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's still a folder location, right?\n\n320\n00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.570\nThe goal and the idea of\nthe purpose is different, right?\n\n321\n00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.660\nWe essentially assume that everything\nthat's in our deleted Items.\n\n322\n00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.430\nAnd I'm making a big\ngeneral assumption here.\n\n323\n00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:08.780\nEverything in our deleted Items is\nessentially at one point useless,\n\n324\n00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:12.040\nbut I do know and I've heard stories\nabout people that actually use\n\n325\n00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.230\ntheir deleted items folder\nas an archival system.\n\n326\n00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.340\nI don't know why you would\nchoose to do that, but you can.\n\n327\n00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.530\nAnd it's available to you.\n\n328\n00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:24.810\nBut by setting it up this way though, you\nknow that the machine actually is gonna\n\n329\n00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:27.090\nrespond to the commands that\nwe've talked about here.\n\n330\n00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:29.020\nWhether by clicking on this little icon or\n\n331\n00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.090\nby using the backspace key,\nit's automatically gonna archive for you.\n\n332\n00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.070\nYou're not going to have to\nworry did I delete that or not.\n\n333\n00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:38.230\nYou know that if you're going to do this,\nit's just gonna get rid of the clutter for\n\n334\n00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.370\nyou from inside of your inbox.\n\n335\n00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.250\nAnd that's whats gonna help you out.\n\n336\n00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:48.600\nBut lets say that, is this our only\noption that's available to us?\n\n337\n00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:54.450\nNot necessarily, normally when you're\ninside of an Office 365 organization,\n\n338\n00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:58.830\nthere is technically something that\nis called the online archiving system\n\n339\n00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.820\nthat is actually set up there for us.\n\n340\n00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.650\nNow we're not really getting into the set\nup of that, because it happens in\n\n341\n00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:09.330\nthe administrative level says look,\nI'm just gonna turn on archiving.\n\n342\n00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.590\nAnd most companies are going to do this.\n\n343\n00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.960\nAnd it's because of\nthe reasons we talked about.\n\n344\n00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:18.500\nUsually, if it's a company that's dealing\nwith people's information, they want to,\n\n345\n00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.260\nbecause they're gonna also enable\nsomething called a legal hold if\n\n346\n00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.430\nthey need to.\n\n347\n00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.980\nAnd that essentially allows that inbox,\n\n348\n00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.650\nregardless of whether a person's\nleft the organization or not.\n\n349\n00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.680\nAnd if they've archived information.\n\n350\n00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.370\nIt will still be there even\nafter the person leaves, and\n\n351\n00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.280\nthen they can even search through all that\nstuff and bring up everything that they\n\n352\n00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.050\nneed to using some search ability\nfunction that they have available.\n\n353\n00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:41.760\nSo online archiving is cool,\n\n354\n00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.760\nbecause it allows us to do\na couple of other things too.\n\n355\n00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:51.429\nIt's available, the archive is available\nfor search not only through Outlook 2016,\n\n356\n00:19:51.429 --> 00:19:56.117\nbut if you're actually using the OWA,\nthe Outlook Web Access.\n\n357\n00:19:56.117 --> 00:19:57.289\nI couldn't remember what app.\n\n358\n00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:57.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n359\n00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.290\nsometimes people call it app as well.\n\n360\n00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:04.300\nThe OWA, or the Outlook for\niOS or Android too.\n\n361\n00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.380\nSo regardless of what device you're on,\n\n362\n00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.530\nthat even makes your archives\nsearchable even on those devices.\n\n363\n00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:15.760\nAnd that is something that we normally\nwill end up seeing in organizations.\n\n364\n00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.232\nSo if you end up seeing that,\nthat's where it's going to pop up, okay?\n\n365\n00:20:19.232 --> 00:20:22.300\nAll right, so now that we've\ngot kind of that idea down and\n\n366\n00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.810\nsetting that up, let's just kind of see\njust a couple of other options here in\n\n367\n00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:27.640\nthe last few minutes that we have.\n\n368\n00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.130\nIf you go look,\nthat's not the way I like to do it.\n\n369\n00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:35.470\nI remember in an earlier edition of\nOutlook that I could actually turn\n\n370\n00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:37.650\non stuff here for archiving.\n\n371\n00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.270\nNow how can I do that\nmanually if I do that?\n\n372\n00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:47.900\nWell if I go back to File and then under\nTools, it is here where you do that.\n\n373\n00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.960\nSo it's under Tools,\nit says clean up old items.\n\n374\n00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:56.480\nIf I select this, notice it's gonna say\nmove this to an Outlook data file instead.\n\n375\n00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.426\nAnd this is instead the option\nthat you would have.\n\n376\n00:20:58.426 --> 00:21:02.073\nAnd the easiest way to turn it on,\nand notice it brings up\n\n377\n00:21:02.073 --> 00:21:06.584\nthe old dialogue box that I've\nseen I think since 2003 at least.\n\n378\n00:21:06.584 --> 00:21:07.084\n&gt;&gt; I remember this one.\n\n379\n00:21:07.084 --> 00:21:08.350\n&gt;&gt; At least as well.\n\n380\n00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.880\nArchive all folders in\nthe AutoArchive settings.\n\n381\n00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.420\nArchive this and all subfolders as well.\n\n382\n00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.900\nAnd notice all of the availability\nfeatures that you have.\n\n383\n00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:23.700\nThis automatically stores it underneath\nyour user profile, under the documents,\n\n384\n00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.060\nand Outlook files that it creates for\nyou if you choose this, okay?\n\n385\n00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.950\nSo it does save it on\na location on your own machine.\n\n386\n00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.620\nBut this also means you better be doing\ngood backups if you're doing this.\n\n387\n00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.750\nIf this machine crashes,\nyour archives are also gone.\n\n388\n00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:43.440\nSo it's not necessarily the greatest\nthing if you're doing that.\n\n389\n00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:48.790\nBut if you already have a nice backup\nscheduled then you're ready to go.\n\n390\n00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:52.050\nBut there's also one other feature too,\n\n391\n00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:56.740\nwhich is listed right up here\ncalled auto archive settings.\n\n392\n00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:02.240\nNow on the auto archive settings, this\none's a little bit more unusual as well.\n\n393\n00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.630\nNot only do we have that Outlook files,\nbut\n\n394\n00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.080\nthere's also something\ncalled a PST file as well.\n\n395\n00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:12.600\nAnd that's for personal storage files for\nour Outlook settings as well.\n\n396\n00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.780\nNow the other one on the archive\nthat we just showed you.\n\n397\n00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:20.970\nIt gives somebody the ability to go\ninto their mailbox on their computer,\n\n398\n00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.170\neven if it's not connected\nto the Internet.\n\n399\n00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:28.120\nThe PST though, really acts as a true\narchive, is when it really acts.\n\n400\n00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.035\nSo this way,\nwe can also end up seeing that,as well.\n\n401\n00:22:31.035 --> 00:22:34.686\nNow to be able to get to that,\nI wanna make sure I can find it,\n\n402\n00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:37.554\nis once I'm actually in\nthe backstage again.\n\n403\n00:22:37.554 --> 00:22:41.699\nI'm going to select Options,\nand when I do so,\n\n404\n00:22:41.699 --> 00:22:47.900\nit's gonna bring me the Outlook options,\nthen in Advanced.\n\n405\n00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.500\nAnd once I'm here in Advanced,\nnotice the setting is still here.\n\n406\n00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.480\nBut Vonne, we've talked about this before\nthat there are some items that are just\n\n407\n00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.560\nburied.\n\n408\n00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.790\nAnd this one, remember, you have to go\ninto File and get to the backstage,\n\n409\n00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:01.530\nand then go Options.\n\n410\n00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:02.700\nAnd then once you actually get in there,\n\n411\n00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.370\nyou have to be able to get into\nthe Advance and there it is, Auto Archive.\n\n412\n00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:12.010\nThis one reduces the mailbox and\nnotice that's the key, right?\n\n413\n00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:14.310\nThe archive feature that we\ntalked about at the beginning?\n\n414\n00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:20.940\nIt doesn't reduce the mail box, this one\nactually is going to either delete or\n\n415\n00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:26.810\nmove the items in this file which means\nits no longer gonna be on the server.\n\n416\n00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:31.440\nSo you're not gonna be able to access this\nvery easily anymore when you do this.\n\n417\n00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.450\nSo once you remove it,\nthat's what's gonna end up happening.\n\n418\n00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.120\n&gt;&gt; This is like taking the banker's\nbox to the storage unit.\n\n419\n00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.620\nIt's offsite and\nit's no longer retrievable.\n\n420\n00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.070\nI'm also thinking of zip files, like if\nyou're gonna take a bunch of files and\n\n421\n00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.050\nI'm zipping it.\n\n422\n00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.350\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Then I'm compressing it, and\n\n423\n00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.260\nI'm moving it off somewhere else,\nthat's what I'm thinking.\n\n424\n00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.115\n&gt;&gt; That's actually a good analogy,\nbecause it really is.\n\n425\n00:23:51.115 --> 00:23:53.169\nYou're now locating it somewhere else,\n\n426\n00:23:53.169 --> 00:23:56.520\nand that means that if you are to do\na search from many other devices.\n\n427\n00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:00.246\nIt might go, either can't find\nwherever that file is located, so\n\n428\n00:24:00.246 --> 00:24:02.370\nI can't really archive it as well.\n\n429\n00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.870\n&gt;&gt; But for whatever reason, it's stored.\n\n430\n00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:11.510\nAnd I could go back and get it in that\nPST file, and be able to retrieve it.\n\n431\n00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:15.100\nI just needed to move it off,\ncuz it's too much for me right now.\n\n432\n00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.200\n&gt;&gt; And you might find that out.\n\n433\n00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.940\nIs that, once you actually told that.\n\n434\n00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.920\nYou need to do this archiving\nto help save space,\n\n435\n00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.320\nthis may be exactly what\nthey're telling you.\n\n436\n00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.040\nAnd the great thing about it\nbecause it's called auto archive,\n\n437\n00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:31.280\nthat means you can set it up to run\nautomatically if you choose to.\n\n438\n00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.470\nNotice that it gives you those options.\n\n439\n00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:35.120\nRun archive every fourteen days.\n\n440\n00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.220\nWell, you have this little spinner,\n\n441\n00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:41.150\nthat you can change the actual time\nperiod that you want this to run.\n\n442\n00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:44.710\nYou can tell it to prompt you\nbefore it runs during the archive.\n\n443\n00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:49.460\nDelete expired items if you choose to,\nbut only from the email folders.\n\n444\n00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.970\nDelete archive or old items.\n\n445\n00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.660\nShow archive folder in the folder list.\n\n446\n00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.680\nIf you go look, I really don't wanna\nsee that, you can simply uncheck it and\n\n447\n00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.590\nthat will also do that too.\n\n448\n00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:00.710\nClean it out.\n\n449\n00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:04.000\nYou name it, there's also these\nother settings that are available.\n\n450\n00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.370\nSo there is a lot in here again,\n\n451\n00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:11.030\nit's stored this time in\nthe archive.pst as well.\n\n452\n00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.830\nSo you might see OST files and\n\n453\n00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:17.820\nPST files, they really kind of\ngive you the same information.\n\n454\n00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.500\nBut one is for accessibility,\n\n455\n00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.380\nwhen you're not connected\ndirectly on to the server itself.\n\n456\n00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.920\nThis one is really for the purpose of\narchiving itself, as what we're seeing.\n\n457\n00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.630\nSo if you choose not to archive at all or\ndo it automatically, you simply uncheck it\n\n458\n00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:39.030\nand then you are, you click OK and now\nyou won't archive automatically as well.\n\n459\n00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:41.684\n&gt;&gt; And with that archive,\nthat auto archive setting,\n\n460\n00:25:41.684 --> 00:25:45.018\nif not making an archive one,\narchive two, it's the same file.\n\n461\n00:25:45.018 --> 00:25:48.676\nAnd it's basically just doing a file save,\nfile save, file save.\n\n462\n00:25:48.676 --> 00:25:50.440\nAnd then it's just kind of keeping.\n\n463\n00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.100\n&gt;&gt; It's adding more information to it.\n\n464\n00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.350\nYes, that's what you're actually doing.\n\n465\n00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:57.502\nSo, when we start thinking\nabout archiving, remember\n\n466\n00:25:57.502 --> 00:26:02.276\nthat in an organization, you're probably\nnot the one that's setting all this up.\n\n467\n00:26:02.276 --> 00:26:06.538\nBut if you're on your own, or if you\ndon't have that exchange organization and\n\n468\n00:26:06.538 --> 00:26:07.820\neverything's set up.\n\n469\n00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.381\nThese are some of the things\nyou might want to consider,\n\n470\n00:26:10.381 --> 00:26:12.899\nespecially if those emails\nin the past are important.\n\n471\n00:26:12.899 --> 00:26:16.059\nBut at the same time, you don't wanna\nbe flooded with a ton of emails and\n\n472\n00:26:16.059 --> 00:26:18.709\nhaving to search through things\nyou don't really want to.\n\n473\n00:26:18.709 --> 00:26:23.377\nIt is a great feature, it's something that\nwe don't really have to worry too much\n\n474\n00:26:23.377 --> 00:26:26.708\ninside of Office 365,\nbecause the online archiving.\n\n475\n00:26:26.708 --> 00:26:30.670\nBut on your own though,\nit's something that you should consider,\n\n476\n00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:34.230\nespecially if you really get\na ton of emails at the same time.\n\n477\n00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:39.441\n&gt;&gt; And I actually have one last little\nanecdote if you want to say for,\n\n478\n00:26:39.441 --> 00:26:44.300\nwhere I actually [SOUND] [LAUGH]\nexperience this just recently.\n\n479\n00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.391\nIn some of the other episodes\nyou have been watching,\n\n480\n00:26:46.391 --> 00:26:49.545\nI was mentioning that I have had to\nset up a lot of virtual machines.\n\n481\n00:26:49.545 --> 00:26:52.650\nMany, many times in the last couple of\nweeks, because of one computer dying and\n\n482\n00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:54.910\nanother computer having to get back on.\n\n483\n00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:56.490\nOnline, if you want to say.\n\n484\n00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.870\nAnd I'm an Office 365 subscriber.\n\n485\n00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:05.730\nAnd I had installed Joey's inbox,\nOutlook on Joey's account.\n\n486\n00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.586\nAnd then that computer died,\nand then I brought it back up.\n\n487\n00:27:08.586 --> 00:27:15.435\nAnd then I'm resetting Joey's\nsettings on Outlook for that machine.\n\n488\n00:27:15.435 --> 00:27:18.552\nIt brought it back up but\nit was from two weeks ago, and\n\n489\n00:27:18.552 --> 00:27:20.853\nit wasn't showing any of the new mail.\n\n490\n00:27:20.853 --> 00:27:24.180\nBut I'm like, but\nI'm connected to my account.\n\n491\n00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.260\nWhy isn't it showing and it gave me\nan actual little warning that said,\n\n492\n00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:33.730\nwhat you are going to need to do is\nyou're going to delete that PST file.\n\n493\n00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:37.454\nAnd then, once you delete that\nwhen I turn back on Outlook,\n\n494\n00:27:37.454 --> 00:27:40.000\nit's going to reset everything for me.\n\n495\n00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.684\nSo, I have actually encountered\nthis same file in the same context,\n\n496\n00:27:44.684 --> 00:27:49.170\nit was archiving,\nit was remembering all of my settings.\n\n497\n00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:53.300\nBut now I'm re-setting up that\nmachine with that account.\n\n498\n00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.425\nI had to start it over.\n\n499\n00:27:55.425 --> 00:27:58.000\nSo, that's something that I had to find.\n\n500\n00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.913\nAnd I actually have like\na little PowerPoint.\n\n501\n00:28:00.913 --> 00:28:03.589\nYeah, let's go ahead and\ncheck Ronnie's account really or sorry,\n\n502\n00:28:03.589 --> 00:28:05.307\ncheck Ronnie's computer really quickly.\n\n503\n00:28:05.307 --> 00:28:07.581\nBecause I sent this to him.\n\n504\n00:28:07.581 --> 00:28:10.879\nIs I had to actually go find that file,\nand\n\n505\n00:28:10.879 --> 00:28:16.270\nwhat I did is I went back into my\naccount settings into the data file.\n\n506\n00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.632\nAnd I have the steps written out for\nyou, and I can go ahead and\n\n507\n00:28:18.632 --> 00:28:20.250\nattach it to this episode.\n\n508\n00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:20.880\nThere we go.\n\n509\n00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.630\nPerfect.\n\n510\n00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:26.050\nAnd so you can see that I had to, it gave\nme a warning and then I had to go into it.\n\n511\n00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:29.940\nI deleted those two JT files\nright there at the bottom.\n\n512\n00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:33.012\nI deleted it out of there, and\nthen restarted Outlook, and\n\n513\n00:28:33.012 --> 00:28:34.372\neverything was perfect.\n\n514\n00:28:34.372 --> 00:28:38.514\nSo, the one thing is you have to check\non that hidden files in the file,\n\n515\n00:28:38.514 --> 00:28:40.846\none is explorer to be able to look at it.\n\n516\n00:28:40.846 --> 00:28:44.019\nBut, definitely check out that little\nPowerPoint presentation that's attached to\n\n517\n00:28:44.019 --> 00:28:44.920\nthis episode.\n\n518\n00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.550\nSo you can see the steps in case\nyou encounter that as well, so.\n\n519\n00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:50.110\nWell, thank you very much Ronnie.\n\n520\n00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:53.010\nGreat information about archiving,\nwhen to do it.\n\n521\n00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:56.100\nYou might not ever need to do it if\nyour organization does it for you, but\n\n522\n00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.370\nat least you'll understand the concept and\nwhere it's all going.\n\n523\n00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:01.390\nAnd it's never really gone, is it Ronnie?\n\n524\n00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.050\n&gt;&gt; True.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n525\n00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:03.890\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you so much for

It's going great.\n\n10\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.194\nWe're gonna talk about different ways that\nwe can share and manage multiple accounts.\n\n11\n00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.380\nSo this is where we're gonna,\n\n12\n00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.040\n[LAUGH] We're gonna start getting\na little circular in this episode.\n\n13\n00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.440\nSo you're gonna need to\nstick with me on this,\n\n14\n00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.750\nbecause I'm going to be demonstrating\nfrom all three accounts.\n\n15\n00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.730\nToday we're gonna be talking about JT,\nand Joey, and\n\n16\n00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.390\nLance and\nhow they all kind of work together.\n\n17\n00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.480\nAnd so,\nI'm gonna try to kind of start with\n\n18\n00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.300\nsome terminology right away\nof the owner and the manager.\n\n19\n00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.324\nSo let's say that JT is\nthe CEO of Boyband.com,\n\n20\n00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:02.490\nor whatever, and\nhe is going to be the main guy.\n\n21\n00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.210\nHe is going to be the owner\nof his email account.\n\n22\n00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.920\nJoey and Lance, they are assistants for\nJT, or we're using both,\n\n23\n00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.150\njust so I can see some variations on\nhow we're going to be sending emails.\n\n24\n00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.786\nBut they're going to be managing his\nemail account, cuz JT is a very busy man,\n\n25\n00:01:22.786 --> 00:01:25.541\nand he's going to be out\nof the office at time.\n\n26\n00:01:25.541 --> 00:01:28.239\nAnd so his assistant, or assistants,\n\n27\n00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:32.320\nare going to be managing\neverything within his Outlook.\n\n28\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.794\nMaybe his email, his calendar,\nhis tasks, all those different things\n\n29\n00:01:37.794 --> 00:01:42.834\nthat he is going to delegate access\nto the managers of his account.\n\n30\n00:01:42.834 --> 00:01:44.840\nSo that's what we're gonna start with.\n\n31\n00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.920\nJT is the owner, and\nLance and Joey are managers.\n\n32\n00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.970\nAnd when you set this is up, you're going\nto have to have two sides of the coin.\n\n33\n00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.065\nThe owner is going to have to give\npermission, is going to have to delegate\n\n34\n00:01:59.065 --> 00:02:04.261\nauthority, or access, to those people\nto allow them into their account.\n\n35\n00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:08.181\nThe other thing that owner is going to\nhave to do is they are going to have\n\n36\n00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:12.670\nto make sure that the folders are visible\nfor them to be able to access.\n\n37\n00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.840\nSo that's kind of side\none on the owner part.\n\n38\n00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.230\nSide two as the manager,\n\n39\n00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.620\nthey're going to have to configure their\naccounts to be able to show that owner's\n\n40\n00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.400\nmailbox in their side navigation pane\nover on the left to make sure that\n\n41\n00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.250\nthey can start monitoring the inbox and\nthen sending out emails on behalf.\n\n42\n00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.960\nSo those are the two different\nparts that we're going to get.\n\n43\n00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.961\nSo we're going to jump into here and\nI'm gonna start demonstrating.\n\n44\n00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:42.237\nAnd I have these things,\nI have all of this already set up, and\n\n45\n00:02:42.237 --> 00:02:44.380\nsome examples of emails back and forth.\n\n46\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.560\nJust so we can kind of not have to wait\nfor some of the things to take hold.\n\n47\n00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.790\nBecause we are working in an Office 365\nenvironment, which means that anything\n\n48\n00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.530\nthat we do here has to go up into the\ncloud, and then back down to the cloud.\n\n49\n00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.990\nAnd it is very possible that these things,\nit takes some time.\n\n50\n00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.032\nSo it-\n&gt;&gt; So timing might not be perfect.\n\n51\n00:03:06.032 --> 00:03:08.997\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah so if I wanted to say,\nlet me go ahead and delegate this\n\n52\n00:03:08.997 --> 00:03:12.594\nauthority, and then on the other part, let\nme go ahead and get this mailbox setup.\n\n53\n00:03:12.594 --> 00:03:15.782\nWell, if this has been mail\nthat's been going on for years,\n\n54\n00:03:15.782 --> 00:03:18.910\nit might take a while for\nall of these things to happen.\n\n55\n00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.690\nSo I kinda set all of this up before\nthe show, [LAUGH] so we can go ahead and\n\n56\n00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.080\nhave this.\n\n57\n00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.772\nAnd the same would be like if we\nwere going to be removing access.\n\n58\n00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:29.530\nWhere I'm, okay,\nnow I don't want you managing anymore.\n\n59\n00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.900\nWell, I could try to demonstrate that but\nthat takes a while.\n\n60\n00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.926\nSo it's like, well,\nit's supposed to be removed but\n\n61\n00:03:35.926 --> 00:03:38.206\n[LAUGH] it's not really showing right now.\n\n62\n00:03:38.206 --> 00:03:40.510\n[LAUGH] So\nthat's why I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n63\n00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.350\njust demonstrate all of\nthese different pieces.\n\n64\n00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.975\nAll right, so,\nthere are some other emails, not emails.\n\n65\n00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:51.840\n[LAUGH] Web addresses that are in\nthe show notes that I would\n\n66\n00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.870\nreally want you guys to look at because\nit's going to outline all of these steps\n\n67\n00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.190\nthat I'm going to be going through.\n\n68\n00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.219\nSo there's the part of like how to\ndelegate your access as the owner,\n\n69\n00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:04.422\nthey call it, and\nthis is where they call it a manager.\n\n70\n00:04:04.422 --> 00:04:06.820\nEven though now I'm using\nmanager on the other side.\n\n71\n00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.205\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So don't get too confused.\n\n72\n00:04:08.205 --> 00:04:10.730\n[LAUGH] I know, I'm already circling.\n\n73\n00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.503\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n74\n00:04:11.503 --> 00:04:16.467\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but then there's another website\nand a page in there that talks about how\n\n75\n00:04:16.467 --> 00:04:21.010\nyou, as the manager or person,\nI don't know what other word to use.\n\n76\n00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.008\nThe other person managing\nsomebody else's account.\n\n77\n00:04:23.008 --> 00:04:25.250\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, if you think about it,\nthe way you're using it,\n\n78\n00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.510\nyou have the owner,\nits the person that this is their account.\n\n79\n00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.070\nThey are also a manager because\nthey can manage the account.\n\n80\n00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.536\nThey can say I want to do this,\nI don't wanna do that.\n\n81\n00:04:33.536 --> 00:04:35.905\nAnd they can make settings and\nchanges, right?\n\n82\n00:04:35.905 --> 00:04:39.172\nAnybody else that can make settings\nchanges is also a manager.\n\n83\n00:04:39.172 --> 00:04:43.228\n&gt;&gt; Yes. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; It might not be\nthe owner, might not be them, right?\n\n84\n00:04:43.228 --> 00:04:44.550\nBut they can manage it.\n\n85\n00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.870\nSo think of it in those terms.\n\n86\n00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.470\nThe owner, it is their mailbox.\n\n87\n00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.340\nThe manager, anyone that can make\nchanges and manage the mailbox.\n\n88\n00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.520\n&gt;&gt; I like that, that's perfect.\n\n89\n00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.632\nSo we have all of our mailboxes and all of\nour accounts open, on all of my machines,\n\n90\n00:04:55.632 --> 00:04:58.745\nall of my virtual machines I keep\nswitching back and forth to.\n\n91\n00:04:58.745 --> 00:05:00.104\nSo this JT.\n\n92\n00:05:00.104 --> 00:05:05.820\nAs the owner, he wants to have\nsomebody else manage his email.\n\n93\n00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.762\nSo what that person is going to\nneed to do is come over into File.\n\n94\n00:05:09.762 --> 00:05:15.710\nCome over into the account settings,\nand we're going to delegate access.\n\n95\n00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.830\nThis is where they're going\nto allow somebody to be\n\n96\n00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.195\nadded onto managing their account.\n\n97\n00:05:22.195 --> 00:05:26.550\nAnd as you can see, Joey and\nLance are already both there.\n\n98\n00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.800\nBut if this was blank, and\nyou're adding your assistant into here,\n\n99\n00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.780\nyou would then click the Add button,\npick the person from your organization,\n\n100\n00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.830\nand then go in to the next field or\nthe next window which is gonna show up,\n\n101\n00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.810\nwhich is about how you want\nto set the permissions.\n\n102\n00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.550\nIf you go ahead also make a big note here,\nlike big asterisks.\n\n103\n00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.300\nYou have to be on an Exchange Server\nto be able to do this.\n\n104\n00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.597\nOr on Office 365,\nwhich in a sense is an Exchange Server.\n\n105\n00:05:54.597 --> 00:05:59.050\nSo if you are not on Exchange,\nnone of this is applicable.\n\n106\n00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.030\nSo that's a big, big note here.\n\n107\n00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.670\nAnd that's why it's pulling\nfrom my global address list.\n\n108\n00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.380\nAnd that's pretty much the only place\nyou would be able to pick people from.\n\n109\n00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.184\nBecause in a global address list,\nyou're all in the same Exchange Server.\n\n110\n00:06:12.184 --> 00:06:14.983\nSo let's pretend we picked somebody.\n\n111\n00:06:14.983 --> 00:06:18.065\nAnd I am gonna come into one\nof these people's accounts.\n\n112\n00:06:18.065 --> 00:06:20.645\nAnd I'm gonna click on\nthe permissions over here,\n\n113\n00:06:20.645 --> 00:06:23.831\nbecause this box is gonna show up\nin just a second, there it is.\n\n114\n00:06:23.831 --> 00:06:27.674\nThis is what's going to come up next\nafter you say, I've added my person,\n\n115\n00:06:27.674 --> 00:06:28.597\nwhat do I do next?\n\n116\n00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:35.086\nAnd this is where you give the permission\nto that manager of your account.\n\n117\n00:06:35.086 --> 00:06:39.950\nThis is where if you didn't want them to\nbe able to send email on your behalf,\n\n118\n00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.990\nmaybe that assistant is\njust there to monitor,\n\n119\n00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.270\njust to be able to read your mail.\n\n120\n00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.960\nThen they can just be a reviewer.\n\n121\n00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.998\nSo you don't have to give them full access\nto be able to write emails on your behalf.\n\n122\n00:06:52.998 --> 00:06:54.912\nYou could just have them\nlook at everything.\n\n123\n00:06:54.912 --> 00:07:00.281\nI mean, it's up to you on what permissions\nthat you, or what access that you want to\n\n124\n00:07:00.281 --> 00:07:05.520\ngrant to that person that you're wanting\nto help manage your life, basically.\n\n125\n00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.134\n[LAUGH] So if I wanted to, you could\nchange these different parts here and\n\n126\n00:07:09.134 --> 00:07:12.900\nmaybe you wanna give them just access\nto your inbox and not your calendar.\n\n127\n00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.370\nBut a lot of times an assistant,\nthey're probably gonna be putting\n\n128\n00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.310\nthings on your calendar and\nmanaging your schedule as well.\n\n129\n00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.480\nEverything is up to you on how\nyou want to delegate that access.\n\n130\n00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.720\nBut these are the different\nsettings that Joey has.\n\n131\n00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.110\nHe can edit and do everything in\nthe inbox and the calendar, but\n\n132\n00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.860\ndoes not have access to contacts,\ntasks, or notes.\n\n133\n00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.510\nYou could also send a message to that\nperson that's going to summarize,\n\n134\n00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:44.020\nI'll give you an example of that when we\ngo over to Lance's account and see that.\n\n135\n00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.430\nAnd I'm pretty sure Lance\nhas the same permissions.\n\n136\n00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.842\nYes, so we've got two people\nthat are able to delegate.\n\n137\n00:07:49.842 --> 00:07:53.220\nNow I'm not sure if you'd\nreally wanna have two people.\n\n138\n00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.918\nBecause then if-\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n139\n00:07:54.918 --> 00:07:58.303\nyou get too many chefs in the kitchen,\nthe soup starts getting salty, right?\n\n140\n00:07:58.303 --> 00:07:59.909\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and\n\n141\n00:07:59.909 --> 00:08:00.783\nI do like a lot of salt.\n\n142\n00:08:00.783 --> 00:08:01.498\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so.\n\n143\n00:08:01.498 --> 00:08:02.153\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yeah,\n\n144\n00:08:02.153 --> 00:08:03.032\nthat's a great point right there.\n\n145\n00:08:03.032 --> 00:08:07.691\nAnd the other thing, as I'm gonna\nshow you Is that as the owner,\n\n146\n00:08:07.691 --> 00:08:13.401\nif they're sending e-mails out on your\nbehalf, you're not gonna see them.\n\n147\n00:08:13.401 --> 00:08:15.180\nJust keep that in the back\nof your mind for one second.\n\n148\n00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.547\nSo if you think about two different\npeople, Lance isn't gonna see what Joey's\n\n149\n00:08:18.547 --> 00:08:21.059\nsending and Joey's not gonna\nsee what Lance is sending, so\n\n150\n00:08:21.059 --> 00:08:22.433\nthat could get a little sticky.\n\n151\n00:08:22.433 --> 00:08:26.100\nIt's like why am I getting this\nresponse from Justin twice?\n\n152\n00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.460\nThese people aren't talking, so\n\n153\n00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:32.020\nI'd probably stick this to maybe\njust one person or have some\n\n154\n00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:36.530\nreally lock-tight system where everybody\nknows what's going on at all times.\n\n155\n00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.380\nSo be careful about that.\n\n156\n00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.981\nThat's just my side note.\n\n157\n00:08:39.981 --> 00:08:42.660\n[LAUGH] We'll click OK.\n\n158\n00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:46.130\nLike I said, there's two things\nthat an owner would need to do.\n\n159\n00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.960\nOne is delegate the authority or access.\n\n160\n00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.300\nThe other is to make their folder visible.\n\n161\n00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:59.540\nSo back over here in JT's mailbox up\nat the top level, his account level,\n\n162\n00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.450\nyou're going to right-click on this, and\nyou're going to go to Folder Permissions.\n\n163\n00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.360\nRemember, this is all laid\nout on those steps on those\n\n164\n00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.850\nweb addresses that are in my show notes.\n\n165\n00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.350\nYou would need to add that\nparticular person, and down here at\n\n166\n00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:17.660\nthe bottom where it says Other, you need\nto make sure that the folder is visible.\n\n167\n00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.596\nIf you don't have that checked off, the\nperson is gonna say, I can't see anything,\n\n168\n00:09:21.596 --> 00:09:22.921\nit's not giving me access.\n\n169\n00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:25.179\nWell, I already delegated access for you.\n\n170\n00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:26.233\nHe's like no, I can't see it.\n\n171\n00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:30.360\nIt's the visibility, because if you look\nat the default, the default doesn't.\n\n172\n00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.300\nYou don't wanna have that.\n\n173\n00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.700\nDon't change the default\nfolder visibility.\n\n174\n00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:40.410\nAdd that user and add the visibility\nto just that user, not anybody else.\n\n175\n00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.680\nI don't think those steps,\nspecify add the user.\n\n176\n00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.460\nOr it might be like really small,\nand it's not bolded or anything.\n\n177\n00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.010\nSo definitely make sure you do that.\n\n178\n00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.940\nOkay, so\nthat's all set up on the owner's side.\n\n179\n00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.124\nLet's go see what then\nthe manager would need to do.\n\n180\n00:09:58.124 --> 00:10:02.700\nI'm over here in Joey now, and\nJoey's actually already got it set up.\n\n181\n00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.920\nSee, if I scroll down here,\nnotice it says Justin Timberlake.\n\n182\n00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.720\nAnd by the way, the support team,\nJoey's on a group, and so\n\n183\n00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.530\nthat you see that the group\nshows inbox drafts, and deleted.\n\n184\n00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.390\nThat is from something completely\ndifferent that we will have another\n\n185\n00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:20.500\nepisode to talk about what groups are,\nand how they are pretty awesome.\n\n186\n00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.160\nBut for now,\nthat's why mine is set up this way.\n\n187\n00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.382\nJustin Timberlake, there's the inbox,\nthis is Justin's email.\n\n188\n00:10:29.382 --> 00:10:30.944\nWhen you start managing multiple accounts,\n\n189\n00:10:30.944 --> 00:10:32.682\nyou gotta be very careful\nabout where you're at.\n\n190\n00:10:32.682 --> 00:10:37.475\n[LAUGH] Because I have done this prepping\nfor this show of like, wait, what?\n\n191\n00:10:37.475 --> 00:10:41.475\n[LAUGH] Okay,\nwhose mailbox am I managing right now?\n\n192\n00:10:41.475 --> 00:10:45.163\nSo I've been saying this\nthrough all my episodes,\n\n193\n00:10:45.163 --> 00:10:49.297\nI'm having who am I issues\nthroughout this entire show.\n\n194\n00:10:49.297 --> 00:10:51.729\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, you're gonna have to spend\na lot of time on a comfy couch.\n\n195\n00:10:51.729 --> 00:10:53.112\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n196\n00:10:53.112 --> 00:10:55.345\nI'm definitely gonna need\ntherapy after this show.\n\n197\n00:10:55.345 --> 00:11:00.620\nSo I have Justin Timberlake's\ninbox that Joey is managing.\n\n198\n00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.260\nAnd so he can see all of that,\nhe can open them.\n\n199\n00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.920\nHe can respond from them as well.\n\n200\n00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.888\nBut back to that setup,\nhow would Joey even get to that?\n\n201\n00:11:09.888 --> 00:11:11.584\nHe knows that JT has delegated.\n\n202\n00:11:11.584 --> 00:11:13.160\nJT said hey, I got everything set up.\n\n203\n00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.220\nGo ahead and add me.\n\n204\n00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:21.020\nYou come over to File &gt; Account Settings\n&gt; Account Settings again.\n\n205\n00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.170\nAnd what you're gonna do is your going\nto add the mailbox into your account.\n\n206\n00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.360\nYou're not adding a new email account\n\n207\n00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.130\nbecause if you're doing that you would\nneed JT's username and password.\n\n208\n00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:34.390\nThey're not gonna give you that.\n\n209\n00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:39.210\nYou're not having full access\nto everything that JT does.\n\n210\n00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.130\nYou're managing his under\nyour account as well.\n\n211\n00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:47.230\nSo that's kind of the kicker right there.\n\n212\n00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:48.660\nKicker, something like that.\n\n213\n00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.840\n&gt;&gt; It works.\n[LAUGH]\n\n214\n00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.007\n&gt;&gt; So I have my mailbox.\n\n215\n00:11:52.007 --> 00:11:53.480\nYou want to click the Change button.\n\n216\n00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.990\nYou click the Change button,\n\n217\n00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:00.040\nthen you've gotta go over to the More\nSettings button down at the bottom.\n\n218\n00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.820\nIt's kind of hidden.\n\n219\n00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.520\n&gt;&gt; They're really burying\nit down in there.\n\n220\n00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they really are.\n\n221\n00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.830\nThat's why I follow those steps,\ncuz they're outlined there.\n\n222\n00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.040\nGo over to Advance and\n\n223\n00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:13.580\nnotice that I have Justin Timberlake as\nopen these additional mailboxes listed.\n\n224\n00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.410\nIf I was doing this for\nthe first time you would click Add.\n\n225\n00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.000\nGo ahead and\ntype in the person's e-mail address,\n\n226\n00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.960\nnot just the person's name on this one.\n\n227\n00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:28.152\nBut jt@officeprodemocode.micro,\n.onmicrosoft, mic [SOUND].\n\n228\n00:12:28.152 --> 00:12:29.355\nI can't even say it.\n\n229\n00:12:29.355 --> 00:12:31.497\n[LAUGH] I can't even type it either.\n\n230\n00:12:31.497 --> 00:12:34.561\nonmicrosoft.com, the whole e-mail address.\n\n231\n00:12:34.561 --> 00:12:38.740\nYou click OK, and then it shows right here\nthat Justin Timberlake has been added.\n\n232\n00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.980\nAnd it will say you're all set.\n\n233\n00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.890\nAnd you might, it always goes up to other,\nsetting it up on your phone.\n\n234\n00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.760\nWe don't wanna go ahead and do that.\n\n235\n00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.550\nWe go ahead and close.\n\n236\n00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.850\nAnd now you might have to restart Outlook.\n\n237\n00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.320\nSo if you scroll down here,\nI don't see the mailbox.\n\n238\n00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.040\nIt's always the, did you try turning\nit on and turning it off again?\n\n239\n00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.860\n[LAUGH] You need to restart Outlook.\n\n240\n00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.800\nSometimes even just go ahead and\nrestart your computer.\n\n241\n00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:07.460\nIf all else fails,\nrestart everything, and usually,\n\n242\n00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.810\nwell, I'd say maybe 70% of\nthe time it fixes things, maybe.\n\n243\n00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:11.506\n&gt;&gt; I'd give it more.\n\n244\n00:13:11.506 --> 00:13:13.157\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Really?\n\n245\n00:13:13.157 --> 00:13:13.793\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, wow, nice.\n\n246\n00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:14.819\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was like,\n\n247\n00:13:14.819 --> 00:13:17.919\n[SOUND] I didn't wanna go too far,\ncuz I was gonna say 90%, but-\n\n248\n00:13:17.919 --> 00:13:18.949\n&gt;&gt; We used to tell people,\n\n249\n00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:20.620\nhave you turned it off and on again?\n\n250\n00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.178\nYeah, the three times you tell us that.\n\n251\n00:13:22.178 --> 00:13:24.244\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We've done it all three times already.\n\n252\n00:13:24.244 --> 00:13:25.600\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now I can help you.\n\n253\n00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.301\n&gt;&gt; This is the magic fourth\ntime you're gonna do that.\n\n254\n00:13:27.301 --> 00:13:28.963\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now we can move and\n\n255\n00:13:28.963 --> 00:13:29.751\nwe can go from there.\n\n256\n00:13:29.751 --> 00:13:32.470\n&gt;&gt; And then they restart it and go, well,\nbecause sometimes they don't just actually\n\n257\n00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:35.482\nrestart it, just log out and log back in,\nand they think that's a restart.\n\n258\n00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:36.409\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n259\n00:13:36.409 --> 00:13:39.510\n&gt;&gt; So we always tell people, restart it.\n\n260\n00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no.\n\n261\n00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:41.643\n&gt;&gt; Turn the power off.\n\n262\n00:13:41.643 --> 00:13:43.690\n[LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; Restart button.\n\n263\n00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:44.330\nYou gotta do that?\n\n264\n00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.962\nYeah, that's what we mean when we say\nRestart, that you hit the Restart button.\n\n265\n00:13:46.962 --> 00:13:50.574\n[LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, terminology.\n\n266\n00:13:50.574 --> 00:13:51.560\n&gt;&gt; It helps, it helps.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes.\n\n267\n00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.893\n&gt;&gt; It helps us speak the same language.\n\n268\n00:13:52.893 --> 00:13:55.904\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what we think is that thing.\n\n269\n00:13:55.904 --> 00:13:57.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's agree on terms.\n\n270\n00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.535\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely, all right.\n\n271\n00:14:00.535 --> 00:14:05.177\n[LAUGH] So now that I have\nrestarted Outlook, and now as Joey,\n\n272\n00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:07.551\nI can look at Justin's email.\n\n273\n00:14:07.551 --> 00:14:09.125\nAnd I can see that.\n\n274\n00:14:09.125 --> 00:14:13.260\nI can see all these media requests and\nI have all of that access,\n\n275\n00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.140\nI would also have access to his\ncalendar and the whole nine.\n\n276\n00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:22.450\nSo if I'm looking at some mail, here\nlet's go with, I think there's something.\n\n277\n00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:23.370\nHere, Chris.\n\n278\n00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:27.940\nSo if I wanted to,\nI would reply to Chris because remember,\n\n279\n00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:33.250\nI am Joey managing Justin, so I'm going\nto be acting on the behalf of Justin.\n\n280\n00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:37.620\nIf I open up his mail,\nwhen I reply to this,\n\n281\n00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.790\nthe other big thing is you being\na manager, you gotta have that From field.\n\n282\n00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.770\nBecause that From field,\nit might try to, hey,\n\n283\n00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:48.370\nI'm gonna look like\nyou're answering as Joey,\n\n284\n00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:52.630\nbut you're really answering as Justin,\neven though you're in Justin's mail.\n\n285\n00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.848\nIt doesn't always set that up right away.\n\n286\n00:14:54.848 --> 00:14:59.400\nSo make sure you have that Options tab,\nyou have the From field.\n\n287\n00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.119\nAnd if it's not listed, then you're\ngonna have to, the very first time,\n\n288\n00:15:03.119 --> 00:15:04.963\nremember I've already set this up.\n\n289\n00:15:04.963 --> 00:15:06.650\nSo like, hey, I don't see Justin's email.\n\n290\n00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:10.930\nYou'd have to click on\nOther Email Address, type that in, and\n\n291\n00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.280\nthen it comes into this drop down for\n\n292\n00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:18.820\nyou to be able to choose who am I emailing\nfrom, because of those multiple accounts.\n\n293\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.200\nSo always make sure as\nthe manager you've got this.\n\n294\n00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.923\nKeep your head in place as\nto who you are at all times.\n\n295\n00:15:26.923 --> 00:15:31.289\nAnd then you can go ahead and\nsend this off and\n\n296\n00:15:31.289 --> 00:15:37.330\nit will be sent as you on behalf\nof Justin Timberlake, okay?\n\n297\n00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:41.005\nRemember, I said that Joey and\nLance are managers,\n\n298\n00:15:41.005 --> 00:15:45.680\nbut I did that specifically to show\nyou that thing that I just said,\n\n299\n00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.624\nthat on behalf of, whoops,\nwhoops, the wrong swipe.\n\n300\n00:15:49.624 --> 00:15:56.370\n[LAUGH] Let's go ahead and move up and\nwe have here, let me, okay.\n\n301\n00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:57.520\nThis is the one.\n\n302\n00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.589\nLet's jump over to Lance.\n\n303\n00:15:59.589 --> 00:16:01.110\nRemember, stick with me, so.\n\n304\n00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:04.477\n[LAUGH] I'm in Lance's computer.\n\n305\n00:16:04.477 --> 00:16:06.325\nAll right, this is the one right here.\n\n306\n00:16:06.325 --> 00:16:07.945\nSo do you see this email?\n\n307\n00:16:07.945 --> 00:16:13.279\nAnd let's zoom in on this,\nit says it's from Joey\n\n308\n00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:21.640\non behalf of Justin Timberlake\nbecause Lance emailed Justin, okay.\n\n309\n00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.720\nJustin said, hey, and\nhe's like hi Justin, this from Lance.\n\n310\n00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.440\nRemember Joey is a manager\non JT's account.\n\n311\n00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.900\nSo Joey is replying on behalf of JT.\n\n312\n00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:36.190\nSo you would see that, and like okay.\n\n313\n00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.640\nWell at least I know this.\n\n314\n00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:45.570\nNow this is a setting that's automatic\nwhen you start delegating access,\n\n315\n00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:48.250\nand the manager is emailing out\non the behalf of the owner.\n\n316\n00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.296\nIt will show that in that from field.\n\n317\n00:16:51.296 --> 00:16:55.990\nI think that's a good thing,\ncuz then everybody knows who's doing what.\n\n318\n00:16:55.990 --> 00:17:02.390\nBut what if you as the owner,\nyou don't want that to be shown that way.\n\n319\n00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:07.062\nOr maybe on the part of the manager or\nthe assistant to the CEO, it doesn't wanna\n\n320\n00:17:07.062 --> 00:17:11.201\nshow, it's Cheryl sending it on\nthe behalf of the CEO of the company.\n\n321\n00:17:11.201 --> 00:17:15.521\nYou just want to make it look like\nit show from Justin Timberlake or\n\n322\n00:17:15.521 --> 00:17:18.150\nfrom that owner of the account, okay.\n\n323\n00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:19.591\nLet me give you the example over here.\n\n324\n00:17:19.591 --> 00:17:23.337\nAnd this is gonna be really hard, you\njust gonna have to trust me on this one.\n\n325\n00:17:23.337 --> 00:17:29.938\nDo you see, this is an email\nthat is coming to Joey and\n\n326\n00:17:29.938 --> 00:17:35.270\nit says that it is wait, yeah, hold on.\n\n327\n00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.510\nWait. Hold on. It's the other way around.\n\n328\n00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.895\nThis is to Justin, wait,\nremember what I just said?\n\n329\n00:17:40.895 --> 00:17:41.543\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where am I?\n\n330\n00:17:41.543 --> 00:17:42.918\nI'm in the wrong inbox.\n\n331\n00:17:42.918 --> 00:17:45.615\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All over the map here.\n\n332\n00:17:45.615 --> 00:17:47.690\n&gt;&gt; I am.\n[LAUGH] Goodness.\n\n333\n00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:48.791\nHere we go.\n\n334\n00:17:48.791 --> 00:17:51.439\nBack to the inbox of Lance's inbox.\n\n335\n00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.680\nNo this is Joey's inbox.\n\n336\n00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.820\n&gt;&gt; This is Joey.\n\n337\n00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:55.580\n&gt;&gt; What did I just say?\n\n338\n00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:58.210\nLet me just show you this email.\n\n339\n00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:01.943\nIt says hello Joey,\nthis email's originating from Lance,\n\n340\n00:18:01.943 --> 00:18:05.903\nbut the from will only say\nJustin Timberlake, not on behalf of.\n\n341\n00:18:05.903 --> 00:18:10.329\nI'm trying to give you the demonstration\nhere [LAUGH] of if I didn't know any\n\n342\n00:18:10.329 --> 00:18:12.715\nbetter, it says Justin Timberlake.\n\n343\n00:18:12.715 --> 00:18:13.570\nIt does not say, on behalf of.\n\n344\n00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.325\nIt doesn't say anything else.\n\n345\n00:18:15.325 --> 00:18:17.480\nI have no idea that this came from Lance.\n\n346\n00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:22.780\nAnd this is where you might want\nto have this as the setting.\n\n347\n00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.770\nFor like the CEO does not wanna show\nthat the assistant is doing all of\n\n348\n00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:27.375\nhis emailing.\n\n349\n00:18:27.375 --> 00:18:30.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's just gotta come from that person.\n\n350\n00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:35.100\nThis is a setting that only at\nthe administrative level that you can set.\n\n351\n00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:39.090\nIt is the send as list.\n\n352\n00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.130\nI think it's a mailbox\ndelegations in the Office 365?\n\n353\n00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.710\nI had to ask Ronnie this because\nI don't have access to this.\n\n354\n00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.150\nI'm just end users right here.\n\n355\n00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:53.350\nRonnie is the administrator of\nour OfficePro demo co company.\n\n356\n00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.390\nHe is the administrator\non the whole account.\n\n357\n00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.550\nI asked him to go ahead and do that.\n\n358\n00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:04.290\nTo go ahead and\nput that Lance was on the send as list.\n\n359\n00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:09.230\nSo anything that Lance as the manager\nof JT's account, it only show\n\n360\n00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:14.630\nbeing from Justin,\nnot from Lance on behalf of.\n\n361\n00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.560\nSo you as an end user can't set that.\n\n362\n00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.594\nYou have to go to the administrative\nlevel and do that so you,\n\n363\n00:19:19.594 --> 00:19:22.462\nthat's where you would have\nto call your IT department.\n\n364\n00:19:22.462 --> 00:19:24.317\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you would have to call the IT and\nsay,\n\n365\n00:19:24.317 --> 00:19:26.611\nI want that gone please\ntake it away cuz it's ugly.\n\n366\n00:19:26.611 --> 00:19:28.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we would have to call you.\n\n367\n00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:30.260\nAnd they would have to set that.\n\n368\n00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:30.804\n&gt;&gt; I got that call.\n\n369\n00:19:30.804 --> 00:19:32.339\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Many times.\n\n370\n00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:33.971\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n371\n00:19:33.971 --> 00:19:37.150\n[LAUGH] And so\nthose are the different things.\n\n372\n00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.890\nAnother point that I would\nlike to make as the owner, and\n\n373\n00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.790\nI already mentioned it, right?\n\n374\n00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:46.650\nSo we have these emails that kinda\nwent back and forth from Lance and\n\n375\n00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:49.310\nJoey as the managers of JT's account.\n\n376\n00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.690\nCome back over at JT's inbox.\n\n377\n00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:55.537\nIt's, hello, Justin from Lance, but\n\n378\n00:19:55.537 --> 00:20:00.510\nremember, Joey responded\non behalf of JT to Lance.\n\n379\n00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.220\nWell, JT doesn't see that.\n\n380\n00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:08.190\nHe's like, well, I don't- Justin,\nJT, the owner of the account,\n\n381\n00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:12.820\nwill not see any of the sent\nmail from the manager.\n\n382\n00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.175\nSo you, two things here.\n\n383\n00:20:16.175 --> 00:20:19.120\nYou better trust that that person\nthat's managing your account,\n\n384\n00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:19.910\n&gt;&gt; Implicitly.\n\n385\n00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:24.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes that is, you will never\nquestion anything that's coming\n\n386\n00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:28.030\nfrom your mouth via them.\n\n387\n00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.350\nSo you better trust them a lot.\n\n388\n00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.010\nThe other thing would be,\nif you wanna see that,\n\n389\n00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:39.530\nyou might wanna set up some kinda\nlike internal office policy.\n\n390\n00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.790\nOffice meaning like a physical office,\nnot Office as like the program.\n\n391\n00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.430\n&gt;&gt; As in, you work for this company and\nthe company policy is X.\n\n392\n00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:51.460\n&gt;&gt; Correct, and as you as a manager\nof the CEO's mail, you need to bcc\n\n393\n00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:57.820\nthe owner to every response\nthat you're sending from them.\n\n394\n00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.930\nSo that way,\ncuz then the owner only gets there in, so-\n\n395\n00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.310\n&gt;&gt; Right, they only get the replies.\n\n396\n00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.860\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n397\n00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:08.840\n&gt;&gt; So if I had somebody managing my\naccount and they sent you an email,\n\n398\n00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.395\nand you reply to it, I would get that.\n\n399\n00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:11.610\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I would get that reply.\n\n400\n00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:13.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But I wouldn't get the fact that they\n\n401\n00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.170\nhad sent that email to you.\n\n402\n00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.180\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; I'll be like, what is this reply from?\n\n403\n00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful that\n\n404\n00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.590\nVonne has reached out to me, but why?\n\n405\n00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like,\nI'm glad I see that I said that.\n\n406\n00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But if that person had never replied to\n\n407\n00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.990\nthe person managing your account\nthat sent that, wow, see the circle?\n\n408\n00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.990\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSee how it goes?\n\n409\n00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.555\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n410\n00:21:28.555 --> 00:21:34.990\n[LAUGH] So you as the owner do not\nsee the sent mail on your behalf.\n\n411\n00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:36.160\nBecause you didn't send it.\n\n412\n00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.290\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It didn't come from your account.\n\n413\n00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.570\nSo it's never gonna show\nup in your sent box.\n\n414\n00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:45.130\nSo you would tell that person, bcc me on\neverything that's like has my name on it.\n\n415\n00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.365\nAnd that way,\ncuz the bcc you receive it so\n\n416\n00:21:48.365 --> 00:21:52.999\nyou're gonna see what people\nare saying out of your mouth.\n\n417\n00:21:52.999 --> 00:21:55.536\n&gt;&gt; You could've easily set that up\nwith a rule or something, right?\n\n418\n00:21:55.536 --> 00:21:58.700\n&gt;&gt; The quick steps, remember the quick\nsteps where you click a little button?\n\n419\n00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.070\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; You could go ahead and do that.\n\n420\n00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:03.530\nSo all the different things on the rules\nand automation, that episode, go back and\n\n421\n00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:04.990\nlook at that one.\n\n422\n00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.637\nAnd you can see that, set up a quick step.\n\n423\n00:22:07.637 --> 00:22:09.407\nClick the little button,\n\n424\n00:22:09.407 --> 00:22:13.870\nalways bcc Justin Timberlake to\nevery single thing that you do.\n\n425\n00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.860\nSo always a good thing to do.\n\n426\n00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:20.360\nLast step, well its not really\na step that I'm going to complete.\n\n427\n00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.240\nBut JT as the owner has decided,\n\n428\n00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:28.390\nI don't want to have Lance and\nJoey managing my account anymore.\n\n429\n00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:32.980\nThe owner would come back into\ntheir delegate access and\n\n430\n00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.590\nin here you would remove them.\n\n431\n00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:39.320\nYou would remove them, but the two other,\nremember there's two steps?\n\n432\n00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.590\nYou remove the delegation or the access.\n\n433\n00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:50.200\nYou would also come back into your mailbox\nsettings into the folder permissions and\n\n434\n00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:56.210\nyou would remove that user with\nthe visibility on your folder too.\n\n435\n00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:59.680\nSo that way they can't see it,\nthey don't have access.\n\n436\n00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:04.450\nSo if you did two steps to set it up,\nyou gotta do two steps to remove it.\n\n437\n00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:08.715\nAnd on the receiver side, they might see\nJustin Timberlake, they might see inbox.\n\n438\n00:23:08.715 --> 00:23:12.670\nBut when they click on it, remember this\nis the manager, it's just gonna be blank.\n\n439\n00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.550\nThey're not gonna see anything out\nbecause you removed visibility,\n\n440\n00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.180\nas the owner, from your account.\n\n441\n00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.106\nOn their side they're not\ngonna be able to see it.\n\n442\n00:23:21.106 --> 00:23:23.252\nSo they can't so anything to it,\n\n443\n00:23:23.252 --> 00:23:27.851\nbut if you wanted to remove that to\njust seeing it in your folder option,\n\n444\n00:23:27.851 --> 00:23:32.400\nyou would have to go into on the,\nremember, let's go back over here.\n\n445\n00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.766\nYou'd come over into File,\nAccount Settings, Account Settings,\n\n446\n00:23:36.766 --> 00:23:38.130\nI'm clicking fast.\n\n447\n00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:38.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Go to Change,\n\n448\n00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:40.170\ngo to back to more Settings.\n\n449\n00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:45.670\n[LAUGH] Come into Advanced and\nremove seeing that in your folder of pane.\n\n450\n00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.737\nSo the same way you set it up is the same\nway [CROSSTALK] you can tear it down,\n\n451\n00:23:49.737 --> 00:23:50.350\nexactly.\n\n452\n00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:55.690\n[LAUGH] So I think that is about\neverything, but I can cover on sharing and\n\n453\n00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:59.339\nusing multiple accounts\nwith delegate access,\n\n454\n00:23:59.339 --> 00:24:04.070\nwhich is different than you're\nsetting up an entire mailbox.\n\n455\n00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:08.720\nLike you're managing both your Gmail and\nyour outlook account.\n\n456\n00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:14.930\nIf you're doing that in your account then\nyou are setting it up as a new mailbox.\n\n457\n00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:19.880\nAnd we did cover that in our\nemail basics or in the interface,\n\n458\n00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.580\nsetting up your account,\nthat's what I believe.\n\n459\n00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:25.550\nSo, in the setting up account,\nif it's you managing just your mail,\n\n460\n00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:30.560\nthat would be multiple separate accounts,\ncuz you have user and passwords.\n\n461\n00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.070\nPhew.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it gets real fun.\n\n462\n00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.970\nIt gets real fun.\n\n463\n00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:36.370\nHopefully your head is not\nspinning to terribly badly.\n\n464\n00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:40.215\nAnd if it is, take a breathe,\nhave a Coke and a smile and a rest.\n\n465\n00:24:40.215 --> 00:24:42.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Come back, rewatch the episode,\n\n466\n00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:44.620\nverify that you understand\neach little step.\n\n467\n00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:47.135\nThat's the great thing about\nwatching it as a recording.\n\n468\n00:24:47.135 --> 00:24:48.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can stop, you can pause,\n\n469\n00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:53.685\nyou can take it into your inner being,\nunderstand it and then move on from there.\n\n470\n00:24:53.685 --> 00:24:54.550\nVonne, we do thank you for\n\n471\n00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:55.533\nexplaining this to us-\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n472\n00:24:55.533 --> 00:24:57.170\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I know it was really difficult.\n\n473\n00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:00.190\nEven thought we know these things,\nit can be very hard to explain it and\n\n474\n00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.600\nmaybe even harder for you to understand.\n\n475\n00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.740\nSo, like I said,\nrewatch this as necessary.\n\n476\n00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.280\nThat being said we have come\nto the end of the episode.\n\n477\n00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.670\nWe do thank you for watching.\n\n478\n00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.210\nSigning off for Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n479\n00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:09.915\n&gt;&gt; And I am Vonne Smith.\n\n480\n00:25:09.915 --> 00:25:11.643\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n481\n00:25:11.643 --> 00:25:21.643\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we have our contacts in here,\n\n36\n00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.540\nand you can see that there are quite\na few different contacts in\n\n37\n00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.600\nJustin's contacts already.\n\n38\n00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.290\nSo I can give you some things to look at.\n\n39\n00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.830\nSo we always wanna go\nthrough the interface first.\n\n40\n00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.880\nWhat am I looking at?\n\n41\n00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.150\nHow can I organize it?\n\n42\n00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.230\nJust the same way that we went through\nour email and we did a whole episode on\n\n43\n00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.600\nthe interface, what is the interface\nthat we're working with in context.\n\n44\n00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.270\nNow the thing is it's not nearly as\nrobust if you wanna say as email.\n\n45\n00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.630\nThere's only so\nmany ways you can look at your contacts.\n\n46\n00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.740\nAnd there's only one real folder in\na sense, they're just my contacts.\n\n47\n00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.710\nAs opposed to the mail where we have like\nour sent mail and our draft mail and\n\n48\n00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.880\nall those different places.\n\n49\n00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.660\nSo once you're in your contacts\n\n50\n00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.800\nwhat are some of the things\nthat we need to look for?\n\n51\n00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.220\nWe have of course our ribbon across\nthe top just like everything.\n\n52\n00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.560\nOur home tab is going to show different\nthings associated with contacts\n\n53\n00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.490\nas opposed to the home tab in\nthe mail area of our Outlook.\n\n54\n00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.950\nSo we have things like new contact,\nwe'll talk about what a group and\n\n55\n00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.260\na contact group,\nthey're not the same thing.\n\n56\n00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.490\nThey're very different.\n\n57\n00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.760\nSo we'll go over with things.\n\n58\n00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.530\nWhat those are, how to delete.\n\n59\n00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.310\nWe have the current view.\n\n60\n00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.370\nNow, before when we're doing our mail,\nwe'll come over to the view tab and\n\n61\n00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.060\ngo through all the different things here.\n\n62\n00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.963\nWith contacts, you really just kinda have\na few ways to look at the contacts and\n\n63\n00:03:11.963 --> 00:03:14.260\nthey're right here on the home tab.\n\n64\n00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.540\nYou have it to where you can\nlook at them in the people view,\n\n65\n00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.030\nwhich I'm looking at, let's see what\nit looks like for business cards.\n\n66\n00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.270\nIt's kind of like, did you ever, I've\nseen people have like those business card\n\n67\n00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.520\nholders, they're leather bound,\nand they can flip through and.\n\n68\n00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.520\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n69\n00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.790\n&gt;&gt; So it's kind of like that, I'm looking\nat every one of my contacts as a card.\n\n70\n00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.210\nDepending on the amount\nof information that's on\n\n71\n00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.010\nthat particular contact\ndepends on what's being shown.\n\n72\n00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.000\nWe have just the card view as well.\n\n73\n00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.180\nThat's almost like the old rolodex\ncards that you have the little\n\n74\n00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.900\nhookies at the bottom,\nthe spinnable thing around.\n\n75\n00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.268\nI used to love playing with that thing.\n\n76\n00:03:50.268 --> 00:03:50.768\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The Filofax.\n\n77\n00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.820\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n78\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.619\n&gt;&gt; With the slide thing down and\nyou push the button.\n\n79\n00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:56.562\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; I loved that thing, it was so cool.\n\n80\n00:03:56.562 --> 00:03:58.330\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, and I would play with it.\n\n81\n00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.620\nMy aunt had one at her house and\n\n82\n00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.590\nI would go to my aunt's house\nevery day after school.\n\n83\n00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.400\nI was fascinated by that thing.\n\n84\n00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And she would always get mad because I\n\n85\n00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.450\nkept messing with it, and I'd all crinkle\nthe pages and they wouldn't go past the.\n\n86\n00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.313\n&gt;&gt; It it wasn't ten kinds of awesome,\nmaybe you wouldn't have touched it.\n\n87\n00:04:13.313 --> 00:04:15.249\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, right?\n\n88\n00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:18.608\nYeah, so yes, this is the card view,\nwe're talking about our childhood,\n\n89\n00:04:18.608 --> 00:04:20.822\nI think we're dating\nourselves too a little bit.\n\n90\n00:04:20.822 --> 00:04:24.990\n[LAUGH] So we have our card view.\n\n91\n00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.010\nYou also have your phone view This is\nreally kind of like your list view,\n\n92\n00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.550\nhonestly.\n\n93\n00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.260\nBecause if you look at your list,\nit looks kind of the same as well.\n\n94\n00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.070\nBut really what you're doing here is\njust different ways of organizing them.\n\n95\n00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.890\nAnd the different, like I am organizing\nthese by it says like by company here.\n\n96\n00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.380\nAnd then you can also sort\nby your different columns,\n\n97\n00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.210\nthis is where in your view you,\nsorry clicking the wrong part,\n\n98\n00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.125\nyou can go through and\nit's the same thing right?\n\n99\n00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:57.115\nBecause I said yes you\ncan go to the view tabs.\n\n100\n00:04:57.115 --> 00:04:58.915\nI didn't want you to\nthink that you couldn't.\n\n101\n00:04:58.915 --> 00:05:02.085\nIt's just that it's not nearly\nas extensive as the mail.\n\n102\n00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:05.645\nBut you can go through and change your\nview settings just like we did in our\n\n103\n00:05:05.645 --> 00:05:11.367\nemail, our search, organize, and\ncustomize, customize, organize and search.\n\n104\n00:05:11.367 --> 00:05:12.122\nYay my cheer.\n\n105\n00:05:12.122 --> 00:05:15.127\n[LAUGH] So\nthe same thing that you can do here of\n\n106\n00:05:15.127 --> 00:05:19.057\nadding different columns how you can\nsort them, how you can filter them,\n\n107\n00:05:19.057 --> 00:05:22.400\nall of the different features,\nsame thing with your contacts.\n\n108\n00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.250\nSo if you're curious about exploring\nthese, watch that one episode.\n\n109\n00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.830\nEven though it's based on email,\nyou'll get the same procedures,\n\n110\n00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.520\nif you wanna say, for\ncustomizing your looks in your contacts.\n\n111\n00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.430\nI like to just keep it over on\nto the regular people view for\n\n112\n00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.250\nnow because we don't have a lot, but some\npeople, I mean, they have hundreds and\n\n113\n00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.030\nhundreds of contacts.\n\n114\n00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.450\nIf you think about it, if you're in sales,\nyou might have a bunch of people in there.\n\n115\n00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.910\nSo understanding how to organize them and\n\n116\n00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.401\nhow you want them to\nlook is very important.\n\n117\n00:05:56.401 --> 00:05:58.850\nAnd so you can go ahead and\n\n118\n00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:04.130\nmess around with some of those view\nsettings, but as you can see in the people\n\n119\n00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.640\nview there's not nearly as many\nas you have with your list view.\n\n120\n00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.440\nAnd if you need to search your contacts\nyou can always click up on the search\n\n121\n00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.000\nfield just like you did in searching\nyour emails and you can search for\n\n122\n00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.410\npeople's names.\n\n123\n00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.280\nYou could also use it by\ncategory because you can\n\n124\n00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.590\ncategorize any of your contacts\njust like your mail and\n\n125\n00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.900\nall of your different search\ntools to get you through here.\n\n126\n00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.410\nNow I don't have, I'm gonna close this\nsearch, I don't have a lot of them.\n\n127\n00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.714\nBut if you start getting them into where\nyou have a lot of them under like as and\n\n128\n00:06:35.714 --> 00:06:39.410\nbs and cs, then those letters\nare going to come into play\n\n129\n00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.420\nwhen you start getting into those lists\nviews of the different card views.\n\n130\n00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.960\nAnd you'll have more to search by and\nhave them organized.\n\n131\n00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.540\nDon't have as many here because,\nwell, we only have a few people\n\n132\n00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.693\nthat we're working with and I don't wanna\nspend time making hundreds of contacts.\n\n133\n00:06:56.693 --> 00:06:58.831\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For no reason other than to show them.\n\n134\n00:06:58.831 --> 00:07:00.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\n\n135\n00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.840\nI think we can demonstrate everything we\nneed to with just a handful right here.\n\n136\n00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.280\nSo looking at the different\nways that we can\n\n137\n00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.650\nchange our view within\nthe contacts area of Outlook.\n\n138\n00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.280\nNow contacts are part of our address book.\n\n139\n00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.182\nSo I remember having an address book and\nit had little animals for every letter.\n\n140\n00:07:20.182 --> 00:07:22.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I had that.\n\n141\n00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.230\nI loved that little address book.\n\n142\n00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.970\nI have no idea where it went.\n\n143\n00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.673\nBut I was actually using it all the way\nthrough, almost through college.\n\n144\n00:07:27.673 --> 00:07:28.421\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n145\n00:07:28.421 --> 00:07:29.892\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay now I'm dating myself.\n\n146\n00:07:29.892 --> 00:07:30.826\n&gt;&gt; When did you go to college?\n\n147\n00:07:30.826 --> 00:07:33.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] 1998.\n\n148\n00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.210\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's when I graduated.\n\n149\n00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.010\nHigh school, high school,\nI graduated high school in 98.\n\n150\n00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so now you know.\n\n151\n00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.695\n&gt;&gt; There you go, and\nknowing is half the battle.\n\n152\n00:07:41.695 --> 00:07:45.165\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, this is how old I am, so.\n\n153\n00:07:45.165 --> 00:07:48.720\n[LAUGH] But I can remember these things,\nand like you had your address book and\n\n154\n00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.700\nyou took that with you and everything.\n\n155\n00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.697\nAn address book in Outlook\nis two different things.\n\n156\n00:07:54.697 --> 00:07:57.289\nIt's over here on the left hand hand side,\n\n157\n00:07:57.289 --> 00:08:02.185\nby the way if you are in the mail section\nas well it's over on that, Find section.\n\n158\n00:08:02.185 --> 00:08:06.130\nIt doesn't matter which section you're\nin or what area of Outlook you're in.\n\n159\n00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.910\nI'm gonna go back over to Contacts,\ncuz that's what we're talking about.\n\n160\n00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.850\nBut your address book is everything.\n\n161\n00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:16.447\nIt could be your Global Address List,\ndepending on where you work.\n\n162\n00:08:16.447 --> 00:08:20.824\nIf you are set up on an Exchange server or\nsome type of Office 365 server,\n\n163\n00:08:20.824 --> 00:08:24.307\nif you wanna say,\nit's where you have your organization.\n\n164\n00:08:24.307 --> 00:08:28.100\nYou're all part of a specific\nuniversity or a company.\n\n165\n00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.791\nAnd you all have the same, well, server.\n\n166\n00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:36.860\nThat comes with that item,\nif you wanna say, of your network.\n\n167\n00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.920\nYou have your Global Address List.\n\n168\n00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.990\nBut you also have your Contacts.\n\n169\n00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:46.199\nNow the Personal is something\nthat JT has set up specifically.\n\n170\n00:08:46.199 --> 00:08:47.600\nAnd I'll show you what that is.\n\n171\n00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.750\nSo if you're not seeing\nPersonal in your address book,\n\n172\n00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.820\nyou're not supposed to, because this\nis something specific to this account.\n\n173\n00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.757\nBut the Contacts, these are the things\nthat are locally stored in\n\n174\n00:08:58.757 --> 00:09:02.633\nyour Outlook not the global\ncompany address list.\n\n175\n00:09:02.633 --> 00:09:04.647\nSo this is containing everything.\n\n176\n00:09:04.647 --> 00:09:08.011\nAnd this is the thing that you are\naccessing when you hit that To field in\n\n177\n00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:09.959\nyour email, that To button on the side.\n\n178\n00:09:09.959 --> 00:09:13.798\nAnd it brings this up so\nyou then could search for and\n\n179\n00:09:13.798 --> 00:09:18.390\nadd into that To field,\nbased your Global or your Contacts.\n\n180\n00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.939\nIt aways defaults to opening up\nin your Global Address List.\n\n181\n00:09:21.939 --> 00:09:26.966\nThis is something that kinda bothered me\nwhen I was working at the university,\n\n182\n00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:30.430\nbecause I had who I needed\nto deal with in my Contacts.\n\n183\n00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.500\nIf you think about\nthe University of Florida,\n\n184\n00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.170\ncan you imagine that Global Address List?\n\n185\n00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.103\n&gt;&gt; It's probably pretty large.\n\n186\n00:09:36.103 --> 00:09:37.188\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot [LAUGH].\n\n187\n00:09:37.188 --> 00:09:42.430\nSo I didn't wanna have to always keep\nhaving to switch it to my Contacts.\n\n188\n00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.830\nYou could change this\nin your Address Book.\n\n189\n00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.200\nIf you go up on the menu to the Tools.\n\n190\n00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.970\nAnd you go to Options.\n\n191\n00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:53.090\nIn the Options you see it says,\nStart with Global Address List.\n\n192\n00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:57.380\nNow I want it to start with my\nparticular folder, my Contacts folder.\n\n193\n00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:03.661\nOr if I had multiple folders within my\nContacts, I could specify those as well.\n\n194\n00:10:03.661 --> 00:10:09.687\nSo that's something like a little tip that\nI honestly wish I kinda knew further back.\n\n195\n00:10:09.687 --> 00:10:10.391\n&gt;&gt; A while back [LAUGH]?\n\n196\n00:10:10.391 --> 00:10:12.134\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because I'm like [SOUND].\n\n197\n00:10:12.134 --> 00:10:13.766\nYeah, cuz you know what?\n\n198\n00:10:13.766 --> 00:10:15.688\nIt bothered me so\nmuch one day that I went searching for it.\n\n199\n00:10:15.688 --> 00:10:17.642\nAnd I'm like, there it is.\n\n200\n00:10:17.642 --> 00:10:20.190\nSo you could always change that,\nif you want.\n\n201\n00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.330\nI'm gonna put it back to Global Address\nList just to keep the default settings.\n\n202\n00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.109\nCuz I'll change something and forget.\n\n203\n00:10:25.109 --> 00:10:26.772\nAnd like, why is it not doing that?\n\n204\n00:10:26.772 --> 00:10:27.969\nI changed it, [LAUGH].\n\n205\n00:10:27.969 --> 00:10:31.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Whoops, that's the wrong one.\n\n206\n00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.019\nSo I'm going to come into my\nGlobal Address List to show you all of\n\n207\n00:10:36.019 --> 00:10:37.754\nmy global addresses.\n\n208\n00:10:37.754 --> 00:10:43.255\nSo that's what our Address Book looks\nlike and what it contains in Outlook.\n\n209\n00:10:43.255 --> 00:10:46.720\nSo we went over the views and we went\nover the different things that we have.\n\n210\n00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.630\nThe folders.\n\n211\n00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.948\nNotice over here that I have Contacts and\nI also have Personal.\n\n212\n00:10:51.948 --> 00:10:54.960\nAnd in Personal, I have Mr.\nBishop Timothy.\n\n213\n00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.757\nGotta get the cats in there [LAUGH].\n\n214\n00:10:56.757 --> 00:10:59.140\nSo this is Justin's folder.\n\n215\n00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:03.550\nHe went ahead and compartmentalized,\nif you wanna say, certain contacts.\n\n216\n00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.780\nAnd that's just for\nyour organizational purposes.\n\n217\n00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.470\nIt's however you want to do it.\n\n218\n00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.700\nSo how the end result gets to.\n\n219\n00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.333\nLet's jump over to Joey's.\n\n220\n00:11:14.333 --> 00:11:17.077\nJoe, I almost said Justin,\nand then kind of extended it.\n\n221\n00:11:17.077 --> 00:11:19.073\nJoey [LAUGH].\n\n222\n00:11:19.073 --> 00:11:20.180\n&gt;&gt; You've got a cockney accent,\nall of a sudden.\n\n223\n00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.020\n&gt;&gt; I know, we're getting into the accents,\nwhich I don't do very well.\n\n224\n00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.973\nBut I know you do them really well.\n\n225\n00:11:24.973 --> 00:11:25.583\n&gt;&gt; Maybe [LAUGH].\n\n226\n00:11:25.583 --> 00:11:27.939\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We talked about trying\nto do a whole episode of [LAUGH].\n\n227\n00:11:27.939 --> 00:11:32.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I would love to do a whole\nepisode in like a Scottish brogue.\n\n228\n00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.730\nIt would just be awesome [LAUGH].\n\n229\n00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.594\n&gt;&gt; The thing is I said that we couldn't\ndo it because I wouldn't be able\n\n230\n00:11:36.594 --> 00:11:37.129\nto get through it.\n\n231\n00:11:37.129 --> 00:11:38.617\n&gt;&gt; No,\nshe'd be dying hysterically [LAUGH].\n\n232\n00:11:38.617 --> 00:11:42.499\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah, it's pretty good.\n\n233\n00:11:42.499 --> 00:11:46.312\nSo back in Joey, I'm ready to\nstart looking at his contacts.\n\n234\n00:11:46.312 --> 00:11:47.050\nAnd, well, guess what?\n\n235\n00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:47.890\nHe has none.\n\n236\n00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.490\nI did this on purpose so we can make one.\n\n237\n00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:54.194\nSo how do I make a new\ncontact from scratch?\n\n238\n00:11:54.194 --> 00:11:56.990\n&gt;&gt; I come over into Contacts and\nwe go to New Contact.\n\n239\n00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.572\nJust like if we we're making a new email.\n\n240\n00:11:59.572 --> 00:12:02.231\nAnd it brings us into\nthe New Contact dialogue.\n\n241\n00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:02.954\nNo, this isn't a dialogue.\n\n242\n00:12:02.954 --> 00:12:05.952\nWell, this is a box.\n\n243\n00:12:05.952 --> 00:12:06.535\nIt's not really a dialogue box.\n\n244\n00:12:06.535 --> 00:12:07.494\n&gt;&gt; It's a dialogue box, I'd say it is.\n\n245\n00:12:07.494 --> 00:12:09.380\n&gt;&gt; We'll call it a window, how about that?\n\n246\n00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.118\nNew Contact window, [LAUGH].\n\n247\n00:12:11.118 --> 00:12:12.931\nAnd then we just start filling it out.\n\n248\n00:12:12.931 --> 00:12:17.880\nAnd the one that we're going to do here\nis we're gonna create our own contact.\n\n249\n00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.788\nBecause in other episodes,\nremember we talked about business cards?\n\n250\n00:12:21.788 --> 00:12:27.270\nWell here we wanna be able to use\nthis business card to send to people.\n\n251\n00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.770\nSo even though it's us, myself, as Joey,\n\n252\n00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:34.760\nyou wanna make your own contact to be\nable to distribute to other people.\n\n253\n00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.540\nSo you can go ahead and just say Joey.\n\n254\n00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:43.996\nAnd your company is Boy Band, Inc.\n\n255\n00:12:43.996 --> 00:12:48.926\nAnd your job title is The Funny One.\n\n256\n00:12:48.926 --> 00:12:50.496\nAnd we can file it this way.\n\n257\n00:12:50.496 --> 00:12:52.390\nYou could go ahead and add a picture.\n\n258\n00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.931\nSo you really just start finding it.\n\n259\n00:12:53.931 --> 00:12:55.940\nAnd this is a picture I've\nalready had on my computer.\n\n260\n00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:00.301\nAnd notice that it is building\nover here on the right-hand side\n\n261\n00:13:00.301 --> 00:13:04.840\nwhat your business card,\nYour Virtual Card File, the VCF file.\n\n262\n00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.993\nI think that's what we-\n&gt;&gt; Contact file.\n\n263\n00:13:05.993 --> 00:13:08.900\n&gt;&gt; Contacts, it was contacts,\nyes, Virtual Contact File.\n\n264\n00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.926\nThat file that you're going to be able\nto attach into your email with your\n\n265\n00:13:12.926 --> 00:13:13.720\nsignatures.\n\n266\n00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.776\nIf you haven't watched that episode,\ngo back and watch your signatures.\n\n267\n00:13:15.776 --> 00:13:17.463\nThis ties together very well.\n\n268\n00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:18.870\n&gt;&gt; Very nicely, yes.\n\n269\n00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.770\n&gt;&gt; And we could go ahead and\nput our email address in there.\n\n270\n00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.779\nAnd luckily it's not JT, it's Joey.\n\n271\n00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:26.396\nDon't make me write this again [LAUGH].\n\n272\n00:13:26.396 --> 00:13:28.548\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Copy and paste this [LAUGH].\n\n273\n00:13:28.548 --> 00:13:30.483\n&gt;&gt; Right, seriously.\n\n274\n00:13:30.483 --> 00:13:34.207\nofficeprodemoco.\n\n275\n00:13:34.207 --> 00:13:37.573\nI'm just gonna say .com,\ncuz I don't wanna keep going [LAUGH].\n\n276\n00:13:37.573 --> 00:13:39.033\nEven though it's totally wrong.\n\n277\n00:13:39.033 --> 00:13:40.720\nAnd then we could put\nit in our web address.\n\n278\n00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.986\nAs you can see,\nyou start filling out your fields.\n\n279\n00:13:43.986 --> 00:13:47.390\nWe can come into our\nBusiness Phone number.\n\n280\n00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.945\nWe should probably put an area code,\nbecause this is so real, isn't it?\n\n281\n00:13:51.945 --> 00:13:57.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; 123-456-7890, perfect.\n\n282\n00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.214\nYou can come into your address and\nyou can put in your address,\n\n283\n00:14:01.214 --> 00:14:06.419\n555, Fancy Pants Lane.\n\n284\n00:14:06.419 --> 00:14:08.960\nI am completely making this up [LAUGH].\n\n285\n00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.420\n&gt;&gt; People live in some interesting\nplaces [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH].\n\n286\n00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.989\n&gt;&gt; Right, you should see them.\n\n287\n00:14:12.989 --> 00:14:18.270\nSo I've got my address in here,\nand that looks great.\n\n288\n00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.917\nNotice that as soon as\nI start clicking off,\n\n289\n00:14:19.917 --> 00:14:21.662\nit's always gonna bring\nthis Check address.\n\n290\n00:14:21.662 --> 00:14:24.020\n[LAUGH] It's not right.\n\n291\n00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.990\nBut it's also,\nit's not understanding what I wrote.\n\n292\n00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.976\nSee how it put the Gainesville, Florida,\ncuz I didn't put that comma there?\n\n293\n00:14:31.976 --> 00:14:35.700\nSo it's nice that it is\nchecking you to say, hey,\n\n294\n00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.530\nI don't understand what\nyou're doing right now.\n\n295\n00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.080\nSo you make sure you go ahead and\nput that in.\n\n296\n00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.724\nAnd I was trying to copy and paste.\n\n297\n00:14:43.724 --> 00:14:45.541\nI just don't think it worked very well.\n\n298\n00:14:45.541 --> 00:14:50.054\nSo you make sure you fill in\nthe appropriate fields into the Address.\n\n299\n00:14:50.054 --> 00:14:54.648\nAnd then if it was a real address,\nyou could click on the Map It Out and\n\n300\n00:14:54.648 --> 00:14:55.786\nview a map of it.\n\n301\n00:14:55.786 --> 00:14:56.720\nAnd you can-\n&gt;&gt; That's kinda cool.\n\n302\n00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is very cool,\nif we were using real addresses [LAUGH].\n\n303\n00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.734\nThat would be really nice.\n\n304\n00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:02.072\nAnd then you could always\nput in your notes.\n\n305\n00:15:02.072 --> 00:15:08.820\nSo you wanna create your contacts\nas detailed as you want it to be.\n\n306\n00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.680\nDo you have to use all the fields?\n\n307\n00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.255\nNo.\n\n308\n00:15:11.255 --> 00:15:13.471\nYou should probably have\nthe right email address.\n\n309\n00:15:13.471 --> 00:15:17.301\nThis is kinda bothering me, like I\ncan't let it go now, officeprodemoco.\n\n310\n00:15:17.301 --> 00:15:19.175\nNow I'm gonna have to do it all over.\n\n311\n00:15:19.175 --> 00:15:27.297\noffjoeyatofficeprodemoco.onmicrosoft.com.\n\n312\n00:15:29.516 --> 00:15:30.266\nRight?\n\n313\n00:15:30.266 --> 00:15:32.962\nYes, check, good [LAUGH].\n\n314\n00:15:32.962 --> 00:15:36.041\nSo I wanna go ahead and save this contact.\n\n315\n00:15:36.041 --> 00:15:39.655\nAnd now I have a contact\nof myself [LAUGH].\n\n316\n00:15:39.655 --> 00:15:42.739\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You never know when that's\ngoing to come in handy, right?\n\n317\n00:15:42.739 --> 00:15:44.313\n&gt;&gt; It will come in handy, yes.\n\n318\n00:15:44.313 --> 00:15:48.456\nCuz now I have a business card that I\ncould go ahead and add my signature.\n\n319\n00:15:48.456 --> 00:15:49.790\nI could forward this.\n\n320\n00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.330\nWe're gonna talk about in the next episode\nabout forwarding or sharing contacts.\n\n321\n00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:57.513\nSo I can send this off to\npeople as my business card.\n\n322\n00:15:57.513 --> 00:16:00.752\nAnd this is not just for Outlook,\nthis is for all mail servers.\n\n323\n00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:02.732\nCuz maybe you're talking to somebody like,\nyeah.\n\n324\n00:16:02.732 --> 00:16:05.281\nI'll go ahead and send you my business\ncard when I get back to the office.\n\n325\n00:16:05.281 --> 00:16:06.704\nIt could be a Gmail, Yahoo.\n\n326\n00:16:06.704 --> 00:16:09.275\nThey will get this,\nthey put into their contacts.\n\n327\n00:16:09.275 --> 00:16:14.120\nSo it's really like you're helping other\npeople out by making your own contact.\n\n328\n00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.369\nSo that's how we can go ahead and\ncreate a new contact.\n\n329\n00:16:17.369 --> 00:16:21.320\nIf I wanted to edit my contact,\nyou can open up the contact and\n\n330\n00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.504\nhere's a little bit different in\nthe window because now you have\n\n331\n00:16:25.504 --> 00:16:30.505\nthe different plus signs for the different\nfields that you're going into.\n\n332\n00:16:30.505 --> 00:16:32.656\nCuz maybe you wanted to\nadd another phone number.\n\n333\n00:16:32.656 --> 00:16:38.130\nYou would have to click the plus sign, and\nthen add, is this a home, is this a work.\n\n334\n00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:43.314\nMaybe we'll go ahead and\nadd a mobile here and\n\n335\n00:16:43.314 --> 00:16:46.462\njust make up some numbers.\n\n336\n00:16:46.462 --> 00:16:51.410\nAnd so now I've saved,\nI've edited that particular contact.\n\n337\n00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:56.500\nIf you are on a Exchange server,\na lot of times this is, cuz I know back\n\n338\n00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:01.570\nat the university, a lot of these\ncontacts in your contact card is based\n\n339\n00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:05.190\non the Active Directory, and everything\nthat's set up within your system.\n\n340\n00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:09.446\nSo you might already have some of this,\nor you might get information from, or\n\n341\n00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:13.454\nwhen we start adding in contacts from\nother people or from other places.\n\n342\n00:17:13.454 --> 00:17:17.282\nYou'll see you might have a lot of\nthat stuff that you don't even have\n\n343\n00:17:17.282 --> 00:17:18.525\ncontrol over.\n\n344\n00:17:18.525 --> 00:17:23.950\nOf what area you're in cuz it's\ndesignated by your company.\n\n345\n00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:28.100\nSo just know that there are some things\nthat you might not necessary control\n\n346\n00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:30.560\nin your contact, yourself.\n\n347\n00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.490\nBut you are making a local contact, so\nthat's different than your global contact.\n\n348\n00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.260\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so anyway,\n\n349\n00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.070\njust throwing that out there in\ncase you see some different things.\n\n350\n00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:42.680\nWe're gonna make one more new one,\n\n351\n00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:47.030\nbecause I want to you show you\nabout adding from the same company.\n\n352\n00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:53.250\nLet's move into, we're gonna talk\nabout Bishop Timothy of the cat.\n\n353\n00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:58.297\nAnd we will just say, Xmas cats, right,\n\n354\n00:17:58.297 --> 00:18:02.769\nXmas cats Inc, and for time purposes\n\n355\n00:18:02.769 --> 00:18:07.540\nwe're just gonna save and close that.\n\n356\n00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.613\nSo now I have a Bishop Timothy for that,\n\n357\n00:18:11.613 --> 00:18:17.445\nI want to make another contact\noff of this same company.\n\n358\n00:18:17.445 --> 00:18:21.800\nAnd this is where if I had the address,\neverything kind of populating in here.\n\n359\n00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.170\n&gt;&gt; This is like a template?\n\n360\n00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just saying,\nit's almost like you wanna copy this, and\n\n361\n00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.850\njust change out a few things.\n\n362\n00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:33.620\nYou can make a new contact\nfrom the same company.\n\n363\n00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:37.210\nAnd notice that it's pulling\nin all of that information, so\n\n364\n00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:40.950\nall I have to do is\nchange out the name here.\n\n365\n00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:44.580\nAnd it's just an easier\nway to get you started.\n\n366\n00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.445\nCuz a lot of times,\n\n367\n00:18:45.445 --> 00:18:48.816\nyou might be working with a bunch of\ndifferent people at the same company.\n\n368\n00:18:48.816 --> 00:18:52.070\nI don't want to have to redo all that\nstuff, just go ahead and do that.\n\n369\n00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:58.448\nSo I like the making a new contact\noff of another one, basically.\n\n370\n00:18:58.448 --> 00:19:03.510\nSo that's ways we can go ahead and\nstart adding contacts in manually.\n\n371\n00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.207\nBut a lot of times we get\nemails from people, and\n\n372\n00:19:06.207 --> 00:19:08.577\nall their contact information is there.\n\n373\n00:19:08.577 --> 00:19:11.945\nAnd it sounds like I wanna make sure\nI remember that person's email and\n\n374\n00:19:11.945 --> 00:19:13.240\nthen I fill in other pieces.\n\n375\n00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:20.590\nI'm gonna come back over to the mail\nsection in Joey and I have Chris.\n\n376\n00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.720\nThis is what, actually,\nhere, let's go to this one.\n\n377\n00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.550\nHello!\nFor you to add the contacts.\n\n378\n00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:27.380\nI like Chris.\n\n379\n00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.890\nI want his email address right there.\n\n380\n00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:33.790\nOne way you can do this is when\nyou come over into the from field,\n\n381\n00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.060\nwhether you open it or\nin the reading pane.\n\n382\n00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:40.280\nIf you right click on this, you can\nadd this directly into your contacts.\n\n383\n00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:40.930\nI love this.\n\n384\n00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.790\nThis is something I use all the time.\n\n385\n00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.770\nI'm building my contact book up.\n\n386\n00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.230\nIt's a lot of times from all\nthe stuff I'm already doing.\n\n387\n00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:49.870\nI add this into my contact.\n\n388\n00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.970\nAnd then I could go ahead and add some\nmore things in here because, maybe,\n\n389\n00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.400\nthis is just showing like the front.\n\n390\n00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.170\nAnd this is where I was saying that\na lot of times you might see things\n\n391\n00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:01.263\nfrom your organization\nalready populated into here.\n\n392\n00:20:01.263 --> 00:20:03.908\nAnd it's probably the global address list,\nbut\n\n393\n00:20:03.908 --> 00:20:06.660\nyou're adding it into your local contacts.\n\n394\n00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.360\nThat's where it's coming into play from\nwhat I was just talking about just\n\n395\n00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.084\na second ago [LAUGH].\n\n396\n00:20:11.084 --> 00:20:16.263\nBut you could go ahead and populate some\nmore things that are not associated or\n\n397\n00:20:16.263 --> 00:20:20.258\ncoming over with it on your own and\nyou can save it like that.\n\n398\n00:20:20.258 --> 00:20:21.548\nLet me show you Lance's.\n\n399\n00:20:21.548 --> 00:20:26.640\nThis is the one where Lance has\nactually sent me his business card.\n\n400\n00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.890\nHe attached his contact like\nwe were just making for\n\n401\n00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.164\nJoey, he went ahead and said here it is.\n\n402\n00:20:32.164 --> 00:20:35.160\nIf I had come up to\nLance Bass in the From field,\n\n403\n00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.200\nlike we just did with Chris,\nand I right clicked and\n\n404\n00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:43.370\nI added this to my Contact, notice that\nit's only gonna give me his email address.\n\n405\n00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:47.310\nIt has his IM address, but\nthat's all that's in here.\n\n406\n00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:52.850\nThat's not nearly as extensive as\nhis actual business card is it.\n\n407\n00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:58.440\nSo you might wanna ask somebody hey,\ndo you have a business card?\n\n408\n00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.320\nSend it to me, and\nhopefully they know how to do that.\n\n409\n00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.960\nAnd you're gonna learn how to do that too.\n\n410\n00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.760\nSo I wouldn't right click on this one.\n\n411\n00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.600\nI would come into the VCF card.\n\n412\n00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.100\nDrop this down, and actually, sorry,\nyou're not dropping it down there,\n\n413\n00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.630\ncuz I'm treating it like an attachment.\n\n414\n00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:16.910\nYou wanna open it.\n\n415\n00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:20.130\nIf you double click it,\nlook at where it opens up into.\n\n416\n00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:22.027\n&gt;&gt; It looks just like\nthe create a contact menu.\n\n417\n00:21:22.027 --> 00:21:25.441\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nYeah, so everything's populated, it's like\n\n418\n00:21:25.441 --> 00:21:30.364\nyes, I will save and close this, and\nnow I have all that person's information.\n\n419\n00:21:30.364 --> 00:21:31.893\nSo those are always a good one.\n\n420\n00:21:31.893 --> 00:21:36.743\nI wanted to show you\nhere that Justin sent me\n\n421\n00:21:36.743 --> 00:21:41.210\na contact, but it's not a VCF card.\n\n422\n00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:45.660\nThis is a contact that they're\nsending it as an Outlook item.\n\n423\n00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:50.157\nNow this is something you probably would\nnot wanna send to somebody that's on\n\n424\n00:21:50.157 --> 00:21:53.009\na Gmail account,\nbecause Gmail is not Outlook.\n\n425\n00:21:53.009 --> 00:21:59.151\nSo Outlook specific, you could send it as\nan Outlook item, and if I open this up.\n\n426\n00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:06.190\nSee it still opens up into the contact,\nit's just very Outlook or Office specific.\n\n427\n00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:11.270\nSo when we get into how you forward\ncontacts and move things around for\n\n428\n00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:13.690\npeople, that will be an option.\n\n429\n00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:19.785\nDo you wanna send as an Outlook contact or\nyou wanna send this as a VCF contact?\n\n430\n00:22:19.785 --> 00:22:21.719\nAnd depending on where you're at, or\n\n431\n00:22:21.719 --> 00:22:25.470\nwhere you're sending it to would\nbe the answer to your question.\n\n432\n00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:28.900\nThe other thing that's gonna happen here,\nis like this is Bishop Timothy, correct?\n\n433\n00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.280\nIf I click and save, I have a problem.\n\n434\n00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.964\nRemember we just made a Bishop Timothy\ncontact for ourselves, but\n\n435\n00:22:35.964 --> 00:22:39.534\nthis is somewhere else where\nit's saying there's a conflict.\n\n436\n00:22:39.534 --> 00:22:42.000\nHey which one do you want?\n\n437\n00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.950\nI put that he was in Xmas Cats Inc, but\nhe's actually now at Cute Cats Inc.\n\n438\n00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:50.842\nIt's another local modeling company for\ncats, cuz he's so adorable.\n\n439\n00:22:50.842 --> 00:22:53.281\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm so biased.\n\n440\n00:22:53.281 --> 00:22:57.215\nSo you could say, do I wanna update this?\n\n441\n00:22:57.215 --> 00:23:01.270\nNow, it does say a backup copy will\nbe saved in your deleted items.\n\n442\n00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:05.420\nGood, so at least that way I'm not\ncompletely getting rid of the one that I\n\n443\n00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.890\nhad as a backup.\n\n444\n00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:12.191\nOr I could add it as a new contact cuz\nmaybe there's another person named\n\n445\n00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:15.372\nBishop Timothy, it's quite-\n&gt;&gt; It could happen.\n\n446\n00:23:15.372 --> 00:23:18.350\n&gt;&gt; It's quite possible that they\nname their favorite cat after their\n\n447\n00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.322\nfavourite goalie or their favorite\nhockey team and then they get traded.\n\n448\n00:23:21.322 --> 00:23:23.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Did you know, it happens, so\n\n449\n00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.819\nwe'll go ahead and\nupdate this information and so\n\n450\n00:23:27.819 --> 00:23:32.270\nnow my contact for\nBishop Timothy has been updated.\n\n451\n00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:36.226\nSo it's always nice to be\nable to have that backup,\n\n452\n00:23:36.226 --> 00:23:39.447\njust in case it's in the deleted folder.\n\n453\n00:23:39.447 --> 00:23:41.912\nWhat about a contact group.\n\n454\n00:23:41.912 --> 00:23:44.303\nWe were adding individual contacts.\n\n455\n00:23:44.303 --> 00:23:45.800\nI use these a lot.\n\n456\n00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.277\nBack where I used to work, I was in\ncharge of many different adjuncts for\n\n457\n00:23:51.277 --> 00:23:52.759\ndifferent semesters.\n\n458\n00:23:52.759 --> 00:23:57.758\nAnd so I had a group of people that\nI would work with in Fall 2016 or\n\n459\n00:23:57.758 --> 00:23:59.351\nSummer of 2015.\n\n460\n00:23:59.351 --> 00:24:03.245\nAnd I needed to be contacting them\nall the time throughout the semester.\n\n461\n00:24:03.245 --> 00:24:06.359\nI didn't wanna add very single\nperson's name individually.\n\n462\n00:24:06.359 --> 00:24:09.925\nSo every semester,\nI would create a new contact group.\n\n463\n00:24:09.925 --> 00:24:13.605\nThis is also referred to as\na distribution list from back in the day.\n\n464\n00:24:13.605 --> 00:24:16.589\nIf you've been back there and\nyou've heard of that,\n\n465\n00:24:16.589 --> 00:24:19.121\nthen this is the new name,\nso distribution.\n\n466\n00:24:19.121 --> 00:24:20.270\n&gt;&gt; Now you're speaking my language.\n\n467\n00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:20.977\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n468\n00:24:20.977 --> 00:24:23.521\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cuz we were like,\ncontact group?\n\n469\n00:24:23.521 --> 00:24:24.696\n&gt;&gt; What the heck is that?\n&gt;&gt; What the heck is a contact group?\n\n470\n00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:25.533\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Distribution.\n\n471\n00:24:25.533 --> 00:24:26.712\n&gt;&gt; Distribute, yeah.\n\n472\n00:24:26.712 --> 00:24:27.254\nGood to go.\n\n473\n00:24:27.254 --> 00:24:28.625\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n474\n00:24:28.625 --> 00:24:30.313\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm right there.\n\n475\n00:24:30.313 --> 00:24:35.085\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So the thing with the contact\ngroup is you need to make sure that each\n\n476\n00:24:35.085 --> 00:24:40.600\nperson that you are adding into your\ngroup is already part of your contacts.\n\n477\n00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.820\nSo, if I was going to be making\na group of Lance, Joey and\n\n478\n00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:48.200\nChris, well, they're already here,\nin my contacts.\n\n479\n00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.790\nSo that's not gonna be a problem.\n\n480\n00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.740\nIt's when they're not already in it,\nthat's where you have to.\n\n481\n00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:56.740\nWait, let me go add them back in there and\nnow I can get them all in a group.\n\n482\n00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:00.790\nSo, new contact group,\nwe're going to name this The Crew.\n\n483\n00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:05.290\nAnd I will add members here.\n\n484\n00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:06.810\nI can add the members.\n\n485\n00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:10.942\nDo I wanna have it from my My Outlook\ncontacts or my address book?\n\n486\n00:25:10.942 --> 00:25:13.490\nAnd this is a lot of times where the\npeople I was working with weren't always\n\n487\n00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:14.472\nin the global address list.\n\n488\n00:25:14.472 --> 00:25:15.200\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n489\n00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.410\n&gt;&gt; So I wanted to get them\ninto my contacts first.\n\n490\n00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:20.060\nSo let's go with from Outlook contacts.\n\n491\n00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.375\nI will pick, well,\nthese people right here.\n\n492\n00:25:22.375 --> 00:25:27.024\nAdd the three however any people that\nyou wanna go into your contacts.\n\n493\n00:25:27.024 --> 00:25:29.064\nYou could also do it from multiple places.\n\n494\n00:25:29.064 --> 00:25:31.053\nIt doesn't have to always\nbe in your contacts.\n\n495\n00:25:31.053 --> 00:25:34.173\nThat's just saying if they're\nnot in the global address list,\n\n496\n00:25:34.173 --> 00:25:36.670\nyou need to make sure that\nthey're in there first.\n\n497\n00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:38.982\nSo I guess that's what\nI was trying to say,\n\n498\n00:25:38.982 --> 00:25:41.112\nwhy you need to put them in there first.\n\n499\n00:25:41.112 --> 00:25:45.040\nNow Vonne,\nhow does this differ from a group?\n\n500\n00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:52.830\n&gt;&gt; Well, a group, it's like\na distribution list, but extended.\n\n501\n00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.178\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; With a contact group,\n\n502\n00:25:55.178 --> 00:26:00.742\nI am adding specific people,\nthat it's really a shortcut for\n\n503\n00:26:00.742 --> 00:26:05.785\nme to address something to\nmultiple people at one time.\n\n504\n00:26:05.785 --> 00:26:12.580\nA group is where,\nit's almost like a clique.\n\n505\n00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.030\nYou remember little\ncliques from high school?\n\n506\n00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.340\n&gt;&gt; Who doesn't remember that?\n\n507\n00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:20.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes and in your group,\nyou have your own little handshakes,\n\n508\n00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:23.910\nand you have your little notes that\nyou pass back and forth to each other.\n\n509\n00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:27.705\n&gt;&gt; I can't say that I've been involved\nin a secret handshake or note passing.\n\n510\n00:26:27.705 --> 00:26:29.178\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm starting to get flashbacks from\n\n511\n00:26:29.178 --> 00:26:29.724\nmiddle school again.\n\n512\n00:26:29.724 --> 00:26:35.846\n[LAUGH] But a group in Outlook,\nit gives you not just contacts.\n\n513\n00:26:35.846 --> 00:26:39.720\nYou get a shared calendar,\nyou get a shared mailbox.\n\n514\n00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:45.130\nLike if you wanted to create\na group of hosts at ITProTV,\n\n515\n00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:47.020\nI could create that right from here.\n\n516\n00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.680\nAnd then we would have\nall of those things.\n\n517\n00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.890\nWe would even have\na shared OneDrive account,\n\n518\n00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:52.980\nwe'd have a shared SharePoint account.\n\n519\n00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:58.161\n&gt;&gt; So it becomes more an actual group\nin a more of a corporate sense of,\n\n520\n00:26:58.161 --> 00:27:00.298\nhere's a group I created.\n\n521\n00:27:00.298 --> 00:27:02.868\nHere are the people that are part of\nthat group, it gets to a mailbox and\n\n522\n00:27:02.868 --> 00:27:03.706\nall that other stuff.\n\n523\n00:27:03.706 --> 00:27:07.628\nAnd like you said, the contacts and\ncalendar and whatnot, and\n\n524\n00:27:07.628 --> 00:27:09.115\nwe all share into that.\n\n525\n00:27:09.115 --> 00:27:09.775\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n526\n00:27:09.775 --> 00:27:12.970\n&gt;&gt; If I send an email to that group,\neverybody in the group gets it, correct?\n\n527\n00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:19.160\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, and it's nice that\nthey've made it so easy to do.\n\n528\n00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.650\nBefore you had to have the IT\npeople set it up and everything.\n\n529\n00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:25.090\nSo the way it's set up here,\nit's quite easy.\n\n530\n00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:29.040\nSo we could go ahead and\ncreate our new contact group.\n\n531\n00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.929\nAnd we can se it's The Crew over here.\n\n532\n00:27:30.929 --> 00:27:35.440\nIf I jump over into my mail\njust to demonstrate this.\n\n533\n00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:40.212\nIf I go with New and\nI just start typing T-H-E,\n\n534\n00:27:40.212 --> 00:27:44.300\nsee, it shows up, The Crew and\nI could say, yep, that's what I want.\n\n535\n00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:48.674\nOr I could click on the to field and\nnotice that it is in my\n\n536\n00:27:48.674 --> 00:27:53.155\ncontacts as a group that I can\ngo ahead and address it to.\n\n537\n00:27:53.155 --> 00:27:56.232\nSo I see it that way,\nthey're not gonna see it that way.\n\n538\n00:27:56.232 --> 00:27:58.640\nThey see it as multiple entries, and\n\n539\n00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.832\nif you click this plus sign,\nit will expand out.\n\n540\n00:28:01.832 --> 00:28:02.830\n&gt;&gt; It gets angry about that.\n\n541\n00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.665\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, it's like-\n&gt;&gt; If you do this, we can't go back.\n\n542\n00:28:05.665 --> 00:28:07.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you will not be able, and\n\n543\n00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:08.840\nthat's fine.\n\n544\n00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.235\nIt's okay cuz they're gonna\nsee it this way anyway.\n\n545\n00:28:11.235 --> 00:28:13.490\nIt's really more for me.\n\n546\n00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:16.640\nAnd I'm double checking, yep,\nI've got everybody in here.\n\n547\n00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:22.957\nWe are good to go and\nthen I can go ahead and send that off.\n\n548\n00:28:22.957 --> 00:28:24.927\nWhoops, I'm like, what is that noise?\n\n549\n00:28:24.927 --> 00:28:26.246\nYou do not wanna save the changes.\n\n550\n00:28:26.246 --> 00:28:27.652\nYou are correct.\n\n551\n00:28:27.652 --> 00:28:32.147\nSo I have a few other\nlittle things right here.\n\n552\n00:28:32.147 --> 00:28:33.563\nBut, where are we, good on time?\n\n553\n00:28:33.563 --> 00:28:34.063\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n554\n00:28:34.063 --> 00:28:34.977\n&gt;&gt; We have a few minutes,\n\n555\n00:28:34.977 --> 00:28:37.501\nour timer's a little off.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, because I was like,\n\n556\n00:28:37.501 --> 00:28:41.206\nI didn't see any hand signals, just Jeff.\n[LAUGH] I was like, I do have a few more,\n\n557\n00:28:41.206 --> 00:28:43.607\nso let's just keep on going.\n&gt;&gt; Let's keep on trucking.\n\n558\n00:28:43.607 --> 00:28:45.278\n&gt;&gt; Good, thank you, [LAUGH] thank you for\n\n559\n00:28:45.278 --> 00:28:46.790\nthat permission.\n\n560\n00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:51.210\nHow can I start organizing my contacts\na little better for me to be able to find?\n\n561\n00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:55.066\nYou can add categories to them,\njust like you can categorize or\n\n562\n00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:59.307\ncolor code your emails, you can do\nthe same thing for your contacts.\n\n563\n00:28:59.307 --> 00:29:04.275\nBecause maybe Fuego Cat,\nFuego Cat is part of a category that you\n\n564\n00:29:04.275 --> 00:29:09.336\nhave already determined through\nyour color coding that purple,\n\n565\n00:29:09.336 --> 00:29:12.939\nfor some reason,\nis your extraneous people.\n\n566\n00:29:12.939 --> 00:29:16.578\n[LAUGH] Or not part of your organization,\n\n567\n00:29:16.578 --> 00:29:22.575\nhowever you determine what these\ncolors mean to you is up to you.\n\n568\n00:29:22.575 --> 00:29:25.500\nOkay, purple means something to you.\n\n569\n00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.100\nGreen means something to you.\n\n570\n00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.500\nAnd if you wanted to make their names\na little bit better than just purple\n\n571\n00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.480\ncategory and everything, you can see band.\n\n572\n00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.630\nWe did this in the email part where we\nwere doing our organize, customize, and\n\n573\n00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:38.390\nsearch, yay.\n\n574\n00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:40.690\nYou can designate those different parts.\n\n575\n00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:44.850\nSo I can attach categories to Context.\n\n576\n00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.890\nI can do it to tasks.\n\n577\n00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:48.210\nI can do it to emails.\n\n578\n00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:51.077\nAnything can become a category.\n\n579\n00:29:51.077 --> 00:29:55.835\nAnd it just makes it a lot easier for\nus to be able to search for later,\n\n580\n00:29:55.835 --> 00:30:01.080\nthat everything is associated\nwith that particular category.\n\n581\n00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.300\nSo I wanted to show you\nhow you can assign that.\n\n582\n00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:08.950\nThe other thing we saw in Justin's\nemail was that he had two folders.\n\n583\n00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:12.360\nHe had a contacts and\nthen he had a personal.\n\n584\n00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.810\nMaybe you wanna do that.\n\n585\n00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:16.320\nMaybe I wanna organize it that way.\n\n586\n00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.910\nNow Joey's was a little bit different.\n\n587\n00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:21.926\nYou see he's got the Skype for Business.\n\n588\n00:30:21.926 --> 00:30:25.395\nThat's because I actually set\nup Skype on this computer.\n\n589\n00:30:25.395 --> 00:30:29.680\nThose contacts for his particular mailbox,\n\n590\n00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.610\nthat's what the one we've been working\non because that's the one by default.\n\n591\n00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.093\nThere's also something where\nit says contact support team.\n\n592\n00:30:35.093 --> 00:30:37.806\nThis is a group, but it's of like,\n\n593\n00:30:37.806 --> 00:30:41.344\nI almost wanna call it\na super group in a sense.\n\n594\n00:30:41.344 --> 00:30:46.286\nBecause was created from the admin level\nwhen Ronnie was doing his Office 365\n\n595\n00:30:46.286 --> 00:30:49.690\nshows, he was using that\nhe created a support team.\n\n596\n00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:53.619\nSo that's why you see multiple things\nover here on the left-hand side in Joey's\n\n597\n00:30:53.619 --> 00:30:56.875\naccount, which looks a little\nbit different from JT's account.\n\n598\n00:30:56.875 --> 00:31:00.900\nBut in the contacts folder for\nJoey's account,\n\n599\n00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:05.036\nthis is where you can make\nother folders off of it.\n\n600\n00:31:05.036 --> 00:31:10.824\nIf you right-click on your contacts,\nnot the my contacts, don't do that,\n\n601\n00:31:10.824 --> 00:31:17.155\nif you click on the contacts and go to\nNew folder, I could name this Personal.\n\n602\n00:31:17.155 --> 00:31:19.023\nAnd it is in the contacts folder.\n\n603\n00:31:19.023 --> 00:31:23.975\nAnd if I click OK,\nnotice that now I have another subfolder.\n\n604\n00:31:23.975 --> 00:31:29.112\nAnd if I wanted to put, let's say\nBishop Timothy, over into the Personal,\n\n605\n00:31:29.112 --> 00:31:34.020\neasiest way, just like our email,\nclick, hold, drag and drop.\n\n606\n00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.318\nI can drag it over into Personal.\n\n607\n00:31:35.318 --> 00:31:38.760\nSo, notice that it is no\nlonger in my main contact.\n\n608\n00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.080\nIt's in my personal group of contacts.\n\n609\n00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:46.460\nAnd so\nit's really just my way of subdividing out\n\n610\n00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:49.160\nmy information how I want it to look like.\n\n611\n00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.134\nSo you don't have to make subdirectories,\nyou could if you want to.\n\n612\n00:31:52.134 --> 00:31:56.800\nAnd the last thing I wanna show you,\nhow to print your contacts.\n\n613\n00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.710\nLet's come back over into\nour main contacts folder.\n\n614\n00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:03.590\nYou can come over here to File and\nyou can go to Print.\n\n615\n00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:08.380\nAnd you can see that there are different\nways that you can print the contacts out.\n\n616\n00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.370\nThe card style, the small booklet style,\n\n617\n00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:14.865\ncuz maybe you have\nthe small booklet style.\n\n618\n00:32:14.865 --> 00:32:17.490\n[LAUGH] The medium booklet style,\nthe memo style.\n\n619\n00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:20.750\nAnd the phone directory,\nwhere it goes ahead and lists this out.\n\n620\n00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:24.716\nNow when you're printing from this place,\nyou're printing all of your contacts.\n\n621\n00:32:24.716 --> 00:32:27.396\nThe whole list of contacts that I have,\nand\n\n622\n00:32:27.396 --> 00:32:31.560\nI wanna put them out in whatever\nway I want them to look like.\n\n623\n00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.480\nLet me move back.\n\n624\n00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:36.251\nBut I really wanna print out this one,\nmaybe just Lance's.\n\n625\n00:32:36.251 --> 00:32:39.157\nBecause I need to give that\nto somebody really quickly.\n\n626\n00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:43.933\nIndividually printing your contacts\nyou wanna do by right-clicking and\n\n627\n00:32:43.933 --> 00:32:45.170\ngo to Quick Print.\n\n628\n00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:47.214\nAnd when I click on, whoops, okay.\n\n629\n00:32:47.214 --> 00:32:48.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You just did it.\n\n630\n00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:49.957\nThis is going out in\nthe printer right now.\n\n631\n00:32:49.957 --> 00:32:51.470\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it is.\n\n632\n00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:54.634\nI just realized-\n&gt;&gt; Someone's gonna be like,\n\n633\n00:32:54.634 --> 00:32:57.890\nI'm getting Lance Bass's content,\nwhat is this?\n\n634\n00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:02.900\n&gt;&gt; Because the printer is set up on\nthis computer on the other account,\n\n635\n00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.460\nI can't remember which account,\nbut it actually have a connection.\n\n636\n00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:09.440\nSo I was going to have it print to a PDF.\n\n637\n00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.420\nBut hey, guess what quick print does?\n\n638\n00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.915\n&gt;&gt; It's hardcore printing.\n\n639\n00:33:12.915 --> 00:33:15.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's gonna print\nto your default printer and\n\n640\n00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:17.170\nthat's what it's gonna look like.\n\n641\n00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:21.414\nSo I believe I have this over,\ndid I have it on Lance.\n\n642\n00:33:21.414 --> 00:33:25.863\nI might've had it on Justin's,\nto where I printed it out onto a PDF so\n\n643\n00:33:25.863 --> 00:33:28.020\nyou could see the result.\n\n644\n00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:32.984\nAnd then you can see it's just one sheet\nof paper with that person's contact on it\n\n645\n00:33:32.984 --> 00:33:33.787\nand, nope!\n\n646\n00:33:33.787 --> 00:33:34.535\nIt's not Lance.\n\n647\n00:33:34.535 --> 00:33:37.856\nI bet you, then, it's JT, there it is, JT.\n\n648\n00:33:37.856 --> 00:33:41.722\nSo we have Lance quick print, there we go.\n\n649\n00:33:41.722 --> 00:33:46.786\nAnd notice that this is what the result\nis that the people that our office is\n\n650\n00:33:46.786 --> 00:33:52.330\ngoing to be seeing off of the printer and\nthis is Lance's contact information.\n\n651\n00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:56.490\nSo quick print individually printing\nyour contacts versus all of\n\n652\n00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:59.840\nyour contacts in your entire Outlook.\n\n653\n00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:00.530\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Vonne,\n\n654\n00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:03.930\nthanks

and\n\n657\n00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:11.385\nI have a feeling that we're not quite\nout of the contact woods quite yet.\n\n658\n00:34:11.385 --> 00:34:13.246\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But as for this episode, we are.\n\n659\n00:34:13.246 --> 00:34:14.050\nThere's not a part two or\nanything like that.\n\n660\n00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:14.857\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n661\n00:34:14.857 -->

Yeah, we use it here.\n\n73\n00:02:34.794 --> 00:02:35.826\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do, don't we?\n\n74\n00:02:35.826 --> 00:02:38.687\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll talk to our switch crew,\nlike maybe Vonne might be\n\n75\n00:02:38.687 --> 00:02:41.391\ntalking to you and\nthe switches need to tell me something,\n\n76\n00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:44.749\nyou've got something on your face, or\ncan you move something to the left?\n\n77\n00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:46.949\nI can get that on my computer,\nyou guys are none the wiser.\n\n78\n00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:48.565\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you say yeah, we do that.\n\n79\n00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:50.032\nObviously I haven't gotten\non that bandwagon yet.\n\n80\n00:02:50.032 --> 00:02:51.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I didn't have the-\n\n81\n00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.613\n&gt;&gt; I don't say we do it a lot.\n\n82\n00:02:52.613 --> 00:02:53.613\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n83\n00:02:53.613 --> 00:02:56.701\nAnd I had a computer completely\nblow up and have to reset it, and\n\n84\n00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:58.289\nthen I had multiple computers.\n\n85\n00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:01.834\nSo I haven't got fully set back up\ninto it, but I was using it before.\n\n86\n00:03:01.834 --> 00:03:07.835\nBut I loved it because you could set, It's\nall connected to your calendar in Outlook.\n\n87\n00:03:07.835 --> 00:03:12.606\nSo if you were in a meeting, that status\nwould actually show up differently.\n\n88\n00:03:12.606 --> 00:03:16.603\nAnd it would show up not just in Skype,\nit would show up in Outlook as well.\n\n89\n00:03:16.603 --> 00:03:19.916\nSo I think it's a really,\nreally great thing to use, and\n\n90\n00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:22.208\nyes you can set up your status in Skype.\n\n91\n00:03:22.208 --> 00:03:25.004\nAnd if I was, this is Joey.\n\n92\n00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:28.463\nIf I was in meeting,\nit would show like In a meeting.\n\n93\n00:03:28.463 --> 00:03:31.255\nAnd after right there, I am available.\n\n94\n00:03:31.255 --> 00:03:35.000\nIn Skype, I could set that as\nDo Not Disturb, or I'm Not Here, or\n\n95\n00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.238\nanything like that.\n\n96\n00:03:36.238 --> 00:03:39.787\nSo that's the tie-in and\nthat's what green check is for you.\n\n97\n00:03:39.787 --> 00:03:41.466\nSo, pretty neat.\n\n98\n00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:44.321\nJust wanted to show you, and\nit showed me, it's behind my head, but\n\n99\n00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:46.611\nit says that Skype is still\nrunning in the background.\n\n100\n00:03:46.611 --> 00:03:50.306\nSo I've closed it, but I didn't sign out.\n\n101\n00:03:50.306 --> 00:03:54.356\nSo if someone was gonna IM me or\nSkype me or, well I guess IM-\n\n102\n00:03:54.356 --> 00:03:55.147\n&gt;&gt; I guess IM.\n\n103\n00:03:55.147 --> 00:03:55.683\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n104\n00:03:55.683 --> 00:03:58.454\n&gt;&gt; It's hard to put a-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n105\n00:03:58.454 --> 00:03:59.363\n&gt;&gt;

All rolled into one big ball of fine.\n\n110\n00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:07.716\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n111\n00:04:07.716 --> 00:04:08.837\n&gt;&gt; It's called collaborating.\n\n112\n00:04:08.837 --> 00:04:10.732\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n113\n00:04:10.732 --> 00:04:12.573\n&gt;&gt; So if Vonne wanted to collaborate,\nshe still could.\n\n114\n00:04:12.573 --> 00:04:14.172\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n115\n00:04:14.172 --> 00:04:17.751\nYes, cuz I'm available,\nso it would pop back up.\n\n116\n00:04:17.751 --> 00:04:19.839\nAnyways, that's where the-\n&gt;&gt;

Right.\n&gt;&gt; Give and take.\n\n178\n00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.029\n&gt;&gt; Kindergarten, right?\n\n179\n00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.925\nIt's what we learned.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n180\n00:07:33.925 --> 00:07:35.005\n&gt;&gt; You share.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n181\n00:07:35.005 --> 00:07:39.358\n[LAUGH] So\nI could request permission to also see\n\n182\n00:07:39.358 --> 00:07:44.169\nthe person I'm sharing\nwith's contacts as well.\n\n183\n00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:45.868\nSo it's a both way type of thing.\n\n184\n00:07:45.868 --> 00:07:47.924\n&gt;&gt; And now,\nLance can spam everyone in your contacts.\n\n185\n00:07:47.924 --> 00:07:50.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, exactly.\n\n186\n00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.569\nSo you can see that those are the two\ncheck boxes that I'm allowed or\n\n187\n00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:59.335\nI can check on or\noff when I'm sharing my contacts.\n\n188\n00:07:59.335 --> 00:08:01.471\nSo now it becomes a sharing request.\n\n189\n00:08:01.471 --> 00:08:02.162\nAs well.\n\n190\n00:08:02.162 --> 00:08:03.219\nI've done both.\n\n191\n00:08:03.219 --> 00:08:07.940\nSo I'm going to click send, and then it\nis saying hey this is a reviewer-only.\n\n192\n00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.770\nThis is read only.\n\n193\n00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.850\nSo they're only supposed\nto be able to see them.\n\n194\n00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.730\nThey can't edit them.\n\n195\n00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.220\nYou probably want to keep that,\n\n196\n00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.930\nbecause you don't really want\nthem changing your contacts.\n\n197\n00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.320\nBut unless this is where\nyou have an assistant and\n\n198\n00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.400\nthey need to have that particular access,\nyou would have to go and\n\n199\n00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.410\nchange the permissions, which I'll show\nyou where, on your contacts folder.\n\n200\n00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.580\n&gt;&gt; So, Von, this isn't them\nactually downloading your contacts\n\n201\n00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.750\ninto their outlook.\n\n202\n00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.440\nThis is them accessing your\ncontacts from your account.\n\n203\n00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.290\n&gt;&gt; They can see them but once, and\nI'll show you once we get over there,\n\n204\n00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.400\nthey can move them into their account.\n\n205\n00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.430\n&gt;&gt; Initially,\nthey're just looking at them.\n\n206\n00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.080\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\nSo we're going to say.\n\n207\n00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.760\nYes, I want them to do a view only.\n\n208\n00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.120\nNotice it gives me that little visual.\n\n209\n00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.100\nIt's like the old visual where it's\nlike moving over, moving over.\n\n210\n00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Like\nthe little nostalgia over there?\n\n211\n00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:03.100\nAnd so now I have shared\nout my contacts with Lance.\n\n212\n00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.190\nIf I come over to Lance's email,\n\n213\n00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:12.200\nnotice that there is an email from\nJoey that is requesting to share.\n\n214\n00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.200\nAnd if I open this,\nit says Joey has requested permission.\n\n215\n00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.450\nThis person has also invited you to\nview his or her contact folder, so\n\n216\n00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.960\nthat's the tiny type that's\nright there in that email.\n\n217\n00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.110\nUp at the top, do you want to\ngive them access to your contact?\n\n218\n00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.980\nOr do you not want to give\nthem access to your contacts?\n\n219\n00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.410\nBecause this is a request,\nso you know, it's up to you.\n\n220\n00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:36.540\nWe'll say yes.\n\n221\n00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.000\nWe're nice, and we're okay with everybody,\n\n222\n00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.780\nand we accepted that\nthis is going to happen.\n\n223\n00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.255\nSo it's supposed to close\nwhen I click allow.\n\n224\n00:09:47.255 --> 00:09:48.390\n[LAUGH] But that's okay.\n\n225\n00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.680\nWe know that it has done it.\n\n226\n00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.470\nI can even do it here.\n\n227\n00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.830\nOpen this, and the nice thing is,\nright here, there we go.\n\n228\n00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.510\nJoey.\n\n229\n00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.200\nOkay, I was waiting that up you know what?\n\n230\n00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.540\nI think I clicked too many times.\n\n231\n00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.810\nIt's like I'm getting there just hold on.\n\n232\n00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:02.960\n&gt;&gt; You look click happy.\n\n233\n00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.370\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n&gt;&gt; You gotta calm it down there.\n\n234\n00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.750\n&gt;&gt; Jimminy clickit I'm sorry.\n\n235\n00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.820\nSo all right,\n\n236\n00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.770\nso now you can see that I'm sharing with\nJoey the permission would be read only.\n\n237\n00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.200\nI say yes, there's that dialog box.\n\n238\n00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.400\nYour contacts has been shared with Joey.\n\n239\n00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.120\nJoey also has granted you\naccess to their contacts.\n\n240\n00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.770\nClick the open this count.\n\n241\n00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:20.920\nIt's funny here.\n\n242\n00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:26.690\nI know this left open this calendar,\nthey have a typo in their message prompt.\n\n243\n00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:30.430\n&gt;&gt; It's not the calendar, they just\naccidentally let the slide through.\n\n244\n00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just thought that was funny.\n\n245\n00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.120\n&gt;&gt; That is, you should submit that\nas a bug report to Microsoft, yeah.\n\n246\n00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz its like,\n\n247\n00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:39.490\nno its not a calendar, we're doing\ncontacts, and its not the people.\n\n248\n00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:40.785\n&gt;&gt; Vonne is gonna change\nthe whole face of Microsoft.\n\n249\n00:10:40.785 --> 00:10:44.405\n[LAUGH] People are gonna\nlose their job over this!\n\n250\n00:10:44.405 --> 00:10:48.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So don't let that throw you,\ncuz it threw me, cuz I was like, okay.\n\n251\n00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.310\nBut it does-\n&gt;&gt; But you know what though?\n\n252\n00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.330\nThat's a legitimate thing,\nthat would throw the uninitiated,\n\n253\n00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.470\nthe people that aren't super tech-savvy.\n\n254\n00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.710\nThis would really bother,\nthey wouldn't know, I'm clicking Calendar.\n\n255\n00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:00.820\nIt says click on the calendar.\n\n256\n00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:01.800\nIt's not showing up.\n\n257\n00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I'm following your\ndirections verbatim Microsoft.\n\n258\n00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.520\nThey're telling me what to do,\nand it's not right.\n\n259\n00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.920\n&gt;&gt; It's not, it's not right.\n\n260\n00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.520\n&gt;&gt; So they're both Cs,\nand we'll give them it.\n\n261\n00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.050\nWe do Office and Outlook all day long.\n\n262\n00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:15.826\n&gt;&gt; Someone's losing their job.\n\n263\n00:11:15.826 --> 00:11:17.937\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n264\n00:11:17.937 --> 00:11:22.790\nSo we're gonna open this\ncontacts folder from the e-mail.\n\n265\n00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.520\nAnd when I come over there notice that,\nover my left-hand side,\n\n266\n00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.040\nmy folder pane has become\nto shared contacts.\n\n267\n00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.860\nI am now looking at Joey's contacts,\nthis is where we have Fuego and Chris and\n\n268\n00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:42.040\nJoey and the crew, if I click on Lance's\ncontacts, Lance only has these contacts.\n\n269\n00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:49.080\nSo this gets back into managing multiple\nmailboxes or accounts or really contacts.\n\n270\n00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.860\nWhere are you?\n\n271\n00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.860\nWho am I doing?\n\n272\n00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:51.700\nWho am at?\n\n273\n00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.580\nWhere am I going?\n\n274\n00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.370\nWhat am I doing?\n\n275\n00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.870\nAll of that kind of stuff.\n\n276\n00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.040\nSo I'm in Joey's.\n\n277\n00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.130\nIf I wanted to take Fuego cat,\nand notice if I click hold and\n\n278\n00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:08.050\ndrag into me as Joey's contacts,\nI've brought in Fuego cat.\n\n279\n00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:13.060\nSo the sharing part and\nopening the contents, that's great.\n\n280\n00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.810\nBut if I came into here, and\nthis should not let me change this, but\n\n281\n00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.614\nthis is where I notice-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n282\n00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:20.146\n&gt;&gt; It does let you change it.\n\n283\n00:12:20.146 --> 00:12:21.753\nEven though it said, read only.\n\n284\n00:12:21.753 --> 00:12:25.570\nBackup.\n\n285\n00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.020\n&gt;&gt; Is it actually changing it?\n\n286\n00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.160\nBecause sometimes they'll\nlet you make a change.\n\n287\n00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:31.870\n&gt;&gt; Actually.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n288\n00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.710\nthen it doesn't actually change anything.\n\n289\n00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:35.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it changed it.\n\n290\n00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:37.120\n&gt;&gt; It made a change?\n\n291\n00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nBut I didn't give it permission to\n\n292\n00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:39.500\nchange so.\n\n293\n00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.570\n&gt;&gt; Now go over to Joey's email account and\nsee if it has changed that.\n\n294\n00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:44.550\n&gt;&gt; Let's see.\n\n295\n00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:45.230\nLet's start.\n\n296\n00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:46.520\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Did you try it on and\n\n297\n00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.370\nturning if off again?\n\n298\n00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.390\n&gt;&gt; I tried, yeah.\n\n299\n00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.690\nCuz maybe it's just in the-\n&gt;&gt; Because it just changed for you, right?\n\n300\n00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:52.680\n&gt;&gt; Good point, you know what?\n\n301\n00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.500\nThis is an experiment.\n\n302\n00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.758\n&gt;&gt; I love learning on the fly,\n\n303\n00:12:54.758 --> 00:12:58.164\ncuz that's exactly what's happening\nright now [LAUGH] I am learning.\n\n304\n00:12:58.164 --> 00:12:59.762\n&gt;&gt; And look at that,\nI'm learning something too.\n\n305\n00:12:59.762 --> 00:13:00.960\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See, there you go, so\n\n306\n00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.210\nit just changes for you.\n\n307\n00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:03.380\n&gt;&gt; In the shared view.\n\n308\n00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.810\n&gt;&gt; In your shared view, right.\n\n309\n00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.440\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but the originator,\nthis person, the owner's.\n\n310\n00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.260\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't change.\n&gt;&gt;

Yep, we are.\n\n477\n00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.660\nSo you can see that these are the contacts\nthat I have in here from Chris.\n\n478\n00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.540\nAnd he needs to give him a whole list.\n\n479\n00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:06.890\nSo if I wanted to export this,\nI click this, what type do I want?\n\n480\n00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:10.800\nAll contacts, I'm gonna go for\njust this group because all contacts\n\n481\n00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.150\nwould be the ones Chris has been\nemailing back and forth on.\n\n482\n00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:18.960\nAnd notice at the bottom, do you wanna\ndo it in like a Google CSV format,\n\n483\n00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.910\nan Outlook CSV format?\n\n484\n00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:23.140\nYou're like, I didn't realize that\nthere were Google and Outlooks.\n\n485\n00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's just the way that\n\n486\n00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:25.950\nthey're using their delineators-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n487\n00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:27.600\n&gt;&gt; And their field names and\nthings like that.\n\n488\n00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.717\nSo that's why it's-\n&gt;&gt; It goes back to that whole mapping\n\n489\n00:21:28.717 --> 00:21:29.354\nthings to make them work correctly.\n\n490\n00:21:29.354 --> 00:21:30.808\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n491\n00:21:30.808 --> 00:21:33.670\n&gt;&gt; Google's already said,\nwe understand people.\n\n492\n00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:37.100\nThere are those out there that are crazy,\nand don't wanna use Outlook,\n\n493\n00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.720\nor Google mail.\n\n494\n00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.440\nSo we'll make it easy for\nyou to migrate over to Outlook,\n\n495\n00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.110\nif that's what you prefer.\n\n496\n00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's nice they do this.\n\n497\n00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.\n\n498\n00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:49.760\n&gt;&gt; We go to Outlook,\nbecause we are bringing this into Outlook.\n\n499\n00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.630\nWe go ahead and export.\n\n500\n00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.330\nNotice there's a [COUGH] vCard format.\n\n501\n00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:58.650\nIf you're in Google and were wanting\nto give your vCard from here you would\n\n502\n00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:04.340\njust select your one contact go into to\nexport, export to selected contacts give\n\n503\n00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:09.160\nthe vcf format and then attach it in your\nmail to send it off to somebody else.\n\n504\n00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.730\nSo we're gonna export all of them.\n\n505\n00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:12.580\nBrings it down.\n\n506\n00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.040\nWe're gonna save this.\n\n507\n00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.050\nI know that it is in my downloads folder,\nso if I view my download,\n\n508\n00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:19.160\nwait that's the wrong one.\n\n509\n00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.830\nWe're gonna come over to here and\nview our downloads and here we go.\n\n510\n00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:27.100\nThere are my contacts,\nno that's the vCard, there it is.\n\n511\n00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.270\nIt's this one, look at the date,\nyou can tell I was practicing.\n\n512\n00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ngot a little Excel icon on there as well.\n\n513\n00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.110\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n514\n00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:34.560\nGood point, see, I was testing you.\n\n515\n00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.813\n&gt;&gt; We're paying attention.\n\n516\n00:22:35.813 --> 00:22:39.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nI have the contacts in my download.\n\n517\n00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.780\nIf I wanted to come in\nto Lance's computer now,\n\n518\n00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.950\nI said it was Joey but\nI've switched over to Lance.\n\n519\n00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:53.580\nLance is now going to import\nthose contacts into here.\n\n520\n00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.520\nSo we come in to open and\nexport, we go to import and\n\n521\n00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.860\nexport, we would like to\nimport from another program or\n\n522\n00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:05.160\nfile because all of the other options of\nimports don't match with what we want.\n\n523\n00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:10.500\nWe click next, we are importing\nin a comma separated value.\n\n524\n00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.970\nNow it's going to tell us where is\nthe file that you would like to import?\n\n525\n00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:17.170\nWe will browse.\n\n526\n00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.220\nWe know we put it in the Downloads.\n\n527\n00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:23.340\nAnd this is the only CSV\nfile that we have in here.\n\n528\n00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.860\nWe click OK.\n\n529\n00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.210\nAllow duplicates to be created?\n\n530\n00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.400\nOr replace duplicates with items imported?\n\n531\n00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:35.543\nBecause maybe there is a contact for\nJoey or the other Joey, that would be\n\n532\n00:23:35.543 --> 00:23:41.285\nJoey McIntire [LAUGH] or Debbie, somebody\nin our office is like, who's that?\n\n533\n00:23:41.285 --> 00:23:43.295\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n&gt;&gt; How do you not know Debbie Gibson?\n\n534\n00:23:43.295 --> 00:23:44.149\nI'm sorry.\n\n535\n00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:45.539\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You get these little\nmillennials running around the office.\n\n536\n00:23:45.539 --> 00:23:46.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n537\n00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:49.323\n&gt;&gt; And it is so much fun to go, you do\nknow what I am talking about, right?\n\n538\n00:23:49.323 --> 00:23:50.036\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n539\n00:23:50.036 --> 00:23:50.714\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n540\n00:23:50.714 --> 00:23:52.294\n&gt;&gt; Who is Debbie Gibson?\n\n541\n00:23:52.294 --> 00:23:54.042\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n542\n00:23:54.042 --> 00:23:55.730\nThen you feel really, really dated.\n\n543\n00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.892\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n544\n00:23:57.892 --> 00:23:58.927\n&gt;&gt; So we'll go here,\n\n545\n00:23:58.927 --> 00:24:01.134\nwe'll allow duplicates to be created.\n\n546\n00:24:01.134 --> 00:24:03.235\nBecause maybe the one\nthat's coming is like, ooh,\n\n547\n00:24:03.235 --> 00:24:06.198\nthat's not the one I wanted because\nthis person worked somewhere else and\n\n548\n00:24:06.198 --> 00:24:08.135\nmaybe it's old, and\nthen you could manually.\n\n549\n00:24:08.135 --> 00:24:11.049\n&gt;&gt; Right, or maybe you have something\nthat's a part of that contact that you\n\n550\n00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:13.140\nalready have that's not\npart of the new contact.\n\n551\n00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.230\nAnd if it overwrites it, well,\nthat's lost to history, right, so.\n\n552\n00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:20.037\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd rather do a little bit\nmore manual, and see how that works.\n\n553\n00:24:20.037 --> 00:24:25.029\nSo we click Next, and we're going to\nbe putting it into our Office Pro demo,\n\n554\n00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:30.190\nbut I want to put it into my contacts,\nso cuz contacts are going into contacts.\n\n555\n00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:33.760\nSo make sure it's going into or\nimporting into the place you want it.\n\n556\n00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.360\nWe click Next, that's what I want.\n\n557\n00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.960\nThat map fields will be something\nyou want to check out, but\n\n558\n00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.047\nGoogle already translated into Outlook,\nso.\n\n559\n00:24:40.047 --> 00:24:41.115\n&gt;&gt; Should be good.\n\n560\n00:24:41.115 --> 00:24:43.740\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna trust them.\n\n561\n00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.850\nIt imports it in, why is it not working?\n\n562\n00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:49.090\nI'm in Joey's contacts [LAUGH].\n\n563\n00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:51.371\nCome over into my contacts, there we go.\n\n564\n00:24:51.371 --> 00:24:52.332\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n565\n00:24:52.332 --> 00:24:59.760\n&gt;&gt; So now we have Debbie Gibson,\nwho is [LAUGH] yeah, the queen of pop.\n\n566\n00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.370\n&gt;&gt; She is.\n&gt;&gt; That is her contact, and\n\n567\n00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.340\nher picture didn't come over,\nwhich was interesting.\n\n568\n00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:08.720\nSo I've made quite a few references\nover here, and then, of course,\n\n569\n00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.240\nwe have our other good boys\nover here with Jordan.\n\n570\n00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.606\n&gt;&gt;

today?\n\n18\n00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.445\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna talk\nall about the calendar.\n\n19\n00:00:40.445 --> 00:00:44.625\nSo we've talked about contacts, again I'm\nalways I'm talking about how I'm filming\n\n20\n00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:46.557\nthem in order, but you can go anywhere.\n\n21\n00:00:46.557 --> 00:00:51.547\nBut this is going to get into calendars\nas opposed to contacts and mail,\n\n22\n00:00:51.547 --> 00:00:56.148\nwhere we've been before, or\nmaybe you haven't been there yet.\n\n23\n00:00:56.148 --> 00:00:57.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna talk about\n\n24\n00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.318\nthe calendar today.\n\n25\n00:00:58.318 --> 00:01:02.800\nAnd we're gonna start off by just\nreally getting in Into the interface of\n\n26\n00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.648\nthe calendar for you to be kind of seeing\nwhat it all looks like on the flip side,\n\n27\n00:01:07.648 --> 00:01:08.398\non the end.\n\n28\n00:01:08.398 --> 00:01:11.735\nAnd then we'll go ahead and\nmove backwards and get into, so\n\n29\n00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:13.600\nhow do I create an appointment?\n\n30\n00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.000\nWhat is an appointment versus a meeting?\n\n31\n00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.841\nWhat is an organizer versus an attendees\nand when a reoccurrence and a private,\n\n32\n00:01:19.841 --> 00:01:20.885\nall that good stuff.\n\n33\n00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:22.056\n&gt;&gt; You're scaring me, Vonne.\n\n34\n00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:24.744\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's okay,\n\n35\n00:01:24.744 --> 00:01:29.777\nI'm here to guide you so, [LAUGH] while\nwe get started with Joey's machine and\n\n36\n00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:32.270\nwe left off here with him in his email.\n\n37\n00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.628\nOkay, so we're here in Joey's\ncomputer like we just said, and\n\n38\n00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.006\nwe've got his mail open.\n\n39\n00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:39.840\nI wanna go over into the calendar.\n\n40\n00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.970\nDown on the bottom in our navigation pane.\n\n41\n00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.230\nWe're gonna click on the little thing\nthat, well, looks like a calendar.\n\n42\n00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.107\n&gt;&gt; Looks like a calendar.\n\n43\n00:01:45.107 --> 00:01:48.896\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll jump down into here,\nand here is my calendar.\n\n44\n00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:52.149\nI know a lot of people live and\nbreathe by their calendar.\n\n45\n00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:58.151\nEverything needs to be scheduled to\nthe minute, everything in there.\n\n46\n00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:03.525\nSo however you utilize your calendar,\nwhether it's just a little bit or\n\n47\n00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:07.417\nyou gotta, this is my life,\nwe have it here for you.\n\n48\n00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:12.390\nThis right now is in the month view\nbecause up at the top we have a new\n\n49\n00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.060\nset of ribbons just like\nwhen we were in mail.\n\n50\n00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.120\nYour Home tab is gonna be looking\ndifferent in your calendar versus your\n\n51\n00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.870\nHome tab in your mail or your contacts.\n\n52\n00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.570\nSo we have a lot of things\nthat look like calendars.\n\n53\n00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.246\nThings that say like day,\nwork week, week, month,\n\n54\n00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:30.877\nthose are the different ways that we\ncan arrange what we're looking at.\n\n55\n00:02:30.877 --> 00:02:33.757\nWe do have our folder and send receive,\n\n56\n00:02:33.757 --> 00:02:38.050\nthose are the same in all of\nthe areas that we're going to.\n\n57\n00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.812\nAnd you do have your View tab that we\nspend a lot of time on by customizing what\n\n58\n00:02:41.812 --> 00:02:42.848\nwe're looking at.\n\n59\n00:02:42.848 --> 00:02:46.455\nAnd it, well, kinda looks the same\n[LAUGH] as the Home tab in the sense\n\n60\n00:02:46.455 --> 00:02:50.521\nthat it has the different places that\nwe can arrange what we're looking at.\n\n61\n00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:54.877\nSo let's jump over into that View tab,\nbecause I do want to spend a little bit of\n\n62\n00:02:54.877 --> 00:02:57.860\ntime here,\ngetting used to our calendar interface.\n\n63\n00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.703\nI tend to always like the month view.\n\n64\n00:03:00.703 --> 00:03:02.997\nI like to be able to see everything,\n\n65\n00:03:02.997 --> 00:03:08.130\nbecause I also don't have all sorts of\ndifferent meetings throughout the day.\n\n66\n00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.800\nSo mine just have a few things here and\nthere.\n\n67\n00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.455\n&gt;&gt; My calendar might look very, very\nsimilar to what you have on the screen.\n\n68\n00:03:13.455 --> 00:03:17.980\nMaybe a thing here,\na thing there, not too booked up.\n\n69\n00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I will be honest, I use\na Google calendar for my personal stuff.\n\n70\n00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.100\nBut since like you said I\ndon't have a lot of things.\n\n71\n00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.070\nI always know I'm gonna.\n\n72\n00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.500\nAnd we have our Fox OMS and that shows me\nwhere every time I'm going to be teach,\n\n73\n00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.950\nnot teaching, what are we doing?\n\n74\n00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.132\n&gt;&gt; Filming.\n&gt;&gt; Filming, yes and\n\n75\n00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:37.163\nteaching you fine folks about Outlook.\n\n76\n00:03:37.163 --> 00:03:40.472\nSo I just use that, so\nthat's a cool another interface, so\n\n77\n00:03:40.472 --> 00:03:43.660\nmy Google Calendar is really more for\nmy personal stuff.\n\n78\n00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.176\nAnd it has things like vacations and\nsome birthdays here and there and\n\n79\n00:03:47.176 --> 00:03:49.690\nthat's really all I've got.\n\n80\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.026\nBut which view you want to be in,\nit depends on how much stuff you've got.\n\n81\n00:03:53.026 --> 00:03:56.182\nI'm gonna scroll up a little bit or\nI guess down.\n\n82\n00:03:56.182 --> 00:04:00.460\nSo I'm gonna scroll down into\nanother month into here.\n\n83\n00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.345\nAnd notice at the top it's gonna\ntell me what month I'm in.\n\n84\n00:04:04.345 --> 00:04:08.185\nThis is May to June, then we're going\ninto June and July, then we're in July.\n\n85\n00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:11.955\nSo the more we scroll down, it's gonna\nkind of tell you where you're at.\n\n86\n00:04:11.955 --> 00:04:14.985\nLet's take this one right here,\nbecause I've put a lot of stuff\n\n87\n00:04:14.985 --> 00:04:17.995\nin the calendar by default to just\nkind of get you familiar with it.\n\n88\n00:04:17.995 --> 00:04:20.028\nWe go over into the week view,\nthere's our week view.\n\n89\n00:04:20.028 --> 00:04:23.924\nIf we go under our work week,\nhow is that different?\n\n90\n00:04:23.924 --> 00:04:26.468\nWell, that takes off the Saturdays and\nSundays and\n\n91\n00:04:26.468 --> 00:04:28.966\nit's just showing me\nthe Monday through Friday.\n\n92\n00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:33.572\nNow if anybody of you's gonna be going\nlike, well that's great if you're on\n\n93\n00:04:33.572 --> 00:04:37.629\na regular work week but maybe our\nwork week is Tuesday through Sunday,\n\n94\n00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.953\nor something different than\nthe traditional work week.\n\n95\n00:04:40.953 --> 00:04:43.490\nMaybe even the work time\nlike eight to five.\n\n96\n00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.375\nIt's showing it's starting at eight and\nit's ending at five.\n\n97\n00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:50.600\nWell, it puts the gray line there, maybe\nthose aren't your regular work hours.\n\n98\n00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.194\n&gt;&gt; Maybe you're night shift.\n\n99\n00:04:51.194 --> 00:04:51.950\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n100\n00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.270\nSo where are you going to go to?\n\n101\n00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.958\nYou're going to go into\nthe calendar options.\n\n102\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.646\nI'll show you that towards\nthe end where we at least\n\n103\n00:04:57.646 --> 00:05:00.030\ngive you all of those\noptions that you can do.\n\n104\n00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.804\nYou come over into the day view,\nwell it depends on, well,\n\n105\n00:05:02.804 --> 00:05:04.200\nwhat day you're looking at.\n\n106\n00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.890\n[LAUGH] And so on July 14th, it doesn't\nlook like we have anything there.\n\n107\n00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.810\nSo maybe we'll jump back\nover into the work week or\n\n108\n00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.490\neven to the work month and\nwe could select which date.\n\n109\n00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.350\nNow how do I know which date that I'm on?\n\n110\n00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.734\nIf you just start clicking on the days,\n\n111\n00:05:18.734 --> 00:05:22.213\nit's highlighting that this\nis the day I want to look at.\n\n112\n00:05:22.213 --> 00:05:26.350\nThis is the day I want to look like or\nlook at.\n\n113\n00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.320\nIn this month view, that little triangle\nthat's on the bottom right-hand side,\n\n114\n00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.110\nif you see that in the month view, that\nmeans that it's saying there's more items.\n\n115\n00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.520\nThere's more than just one appointment or\nmeeting or\n\n116\n00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.456\nsomething that is\nscheduled within that day.\n\n117\n00:05:41.456 --> 00:05:45.036\nSo if I select this particular day and\nthen come over here to the day view,\n\n118\n00:05:45.036 --> 00:05:48.218\nI can see that this gives me at\nleast there's something in here.\n\n119\n00:05:48.218 --> 00:05:52.810\nI have a directors meeting at 9 and\nI have some office hours at 2 PM.\n\n120\n00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.140\nWhy are they different colors?\n\n121\n00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.810\nThe orange, the orange is coming from\nthe default colors that I have chosen for\n\n122\n00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.650\nthe entire calendar.\n\n123\n00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.476\nThe green, the green is a category, we\ntalked about in our search organize and,\n\n124\n00:06:08.476 --> 00:06:13.118\norganize, customize, and search,\nyay, in the email [LAUGH].\n\n125\n00:06:13.118 --> 00:06:16.434\nTalked a lot about categories and\nthe different ways we can reset our views.\n\n126\n00:06:16.434 --> 00:06:21.639\nThat applies pretty much across the board,\nin contacts, into our calendar.\n\n127\n00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.447\nSo I would definitely go back and\nwatch that episode to get into some\n\n128\n00:06:25.447 --> 00:06:28.507\nof these different view\nsettings that I get into, and\n\n129\n00:06:28.507 --> 00:06:32.056\nchanging the view into these\ndifferent ways and managing it.\n\n130\n00:06:32.056 --> 00:06:35.260\nIt applies here into our calendar.\n\n131\n00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.617\nI'm not gonna go too deep into that\nsince it's kind of all the same,\n\n132\n00:06:39.617 --> 00:06:41.308\njust same but different.\n\n133\n00:06:41.308 --> 00:06:42.376\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; My favorite saying.\n\n134\n00:06:42.376 --> 00:06:44.840\n[LAUGH] So definitely watch that.\n\n135\n00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.720\nBut the categories is where\nyou're color coding your self, or\n\n136\n00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.570\nyour life of what green means to you and\nwhat orange means to you.\n\n137\n00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.200\nAnd you can set that across\nall of your different items,\n\n138\n00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.470\ncalendar items, meetings, emails,\n\n139\n00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:06.400\ncontacts, that everybody that's associated\nwith green means something to you.\n\n140\n00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.820\nSo you start tagging your items.\n\n141\n00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.702\nLet's come back over to month view.\n\n142\n00:07:11.702 --> 00:07:16.080\nLike I was saying that color,\nI can choose a color scheme.\n\n143\n00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.950\nThis is not the automatic,\nblue is the automatic.\n\n144\n00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.280\nI was trying to,\nsince I work with JT, and Lance, and\n\n145\n00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.290\nJoey on our different machines, trying\nto keep myself as to which one I'm in.\n\n146\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.500\nI've done the office theme across the top,\nbut just to give it a little bit of\n\n147\n00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:37.670\na different flair in here, so I've picked\norange for the color on this view tab.\n\n148\n00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:41.195\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's interesting how just\nthe different colors can help you in\n\n149\n00:07:41.195 --> 00:07:44.302\nyour mind very quickly categorize and\norganize where it is and\n\n150\n00:07:44.302 --> 00:07:46.170\nwhat you're doing at just a glance.\n\n151\n00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.098\nYou don't even have to read any specifics.\n\n152\n00:07:49.098 --> 00:07:51.176\nI see the red color,\nI know exactly what that's about.\n\n153\n00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:52.591\n&gt;&gt; And that color means something to me.\n\n154\n00:07:52.591 --> 00:07:55.555\nProbably doesn't mean anything to you,\nbut [LAUGH] it means something to me.\n\n155\n00:07:55.555 --> 00:08:00.019\nSome other things that we're seeing in the\noverall interface across the top, we have\n\n156\n00:08:00.019 --> 00:08:04.049\nthe weather that's across here, and\n[LAUGH] depending on what season you're\n\n157\n00:08:04.049 --> 00:08:08.740\nwatching this recording, and what area\nof the country, and you're like really?\n\n158\n00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.760\nThat's your weather that\nyou live with everyday?\n\n159\n00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.041\nYeah, I know it's horrible isn't it?\n\n160\n00:08:12.041 --> 00:08:13.241\n&gt;&gt; Actually that is super nice weather.\n\n161\n00:08:13.241 --> 00:08:15.684\nNormally it would be like 97.\n\n162\n00:08:15.684 --> 00:08:17.444\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n163\n00:08:17.444 --> 00:08:18.766\n&gt;&gt; With humidity of 100 percent.\n\n164\n00:08:18.766 --> 00:08:23.099\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but if you're in somewhere\nlike North Dakota or Minnesota and\n\n165\n00:08:23.099 --> 00:08:26.320\nit's sleeting rain, you kind of like.\n\n166\n00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.460\n&gt;&gt; Right now we're having\nunseasonably nice weather.\n\n167\n00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.135\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's beautiful.\n\n168\n00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:30.635\n&gt;&gt; That's very nice.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n169\n00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:31.135\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n170\n00:08:31.135 --> 00:08:32.137\n&gt;&gt; So but it's nice that\n\n171\n00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:34.196\nthe weather is right\nthere across the top for\n\n172\n00:08:34.196 --> 00:08:37.034\nme to go ahead and look at and\nsee what it's like outside, and\n\n173\n00:08:37.034 --> 00:08:39.140\nwhat it's going to be for this weekend.\nAnd\n\n174\n00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.508\nI'm really looking forward to a gorgeous\nweekend and I will be going to the beach.\n\n175\n00:08:43.508 --> 00:08:44.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n176\n00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.202\n&gt;&gt; So I have that weather across the top.\n\n177\n00:08:46.202 --> 00:08:49.060\nWhat are the other things we're looking\n\n178\n00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.280\nat in our interface?\nOver on the left-hand side in our\n\n179\n00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.640\nfolder pane, our navigation,\nor whatever we wanna say,\n\n180\n00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:01.010\nwe have this part over here on the left\nthat's giving us a month view.\n\n181\n00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:05.370\nIf you look at it, there's some numbers\nin here that are bold and not bold.\n\n182\n00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.860\nWhat does that indicate?\n\n183\n00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.910\nIf it's bold,\nyou have something scheduled for that day.\n\n184\n00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.400\nIf it's not bold, you don't have\nanything scheduled for that day.\n\n185\n00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.750\nSo that's a nice little intro, a visual\nright there as to what you're looking at.\n\n186\n00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.550\nThere is a line in between here,\n\n187\n00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:23.040\nthat if you hover between them as you\nget the two-pointed white arrows.\n\n188\n00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.590\nSo if it comes in looking like this, where\nyou have two months, you could have that.\n\n189\n00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.250\nSince there's not a lot of real estate\nin this resolution I have on my monitor,\n\n190\n00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.250\nI went ahead and\nmoved that up to just show one month.\n\n191\n00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.970\nAnd you can use this here to go ahead and\n\n192\n00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.856\nnavigate into what month\nyou want to look at.\n\n193\n00:09:39.856 --> 00:09:44.490\nInstead of using the scroll, you could\njump over into July or to August or\n\n194\n00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:45.620\nto September.\n\n195\n00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.350\nAnd back and forth, and\n\n196\n00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:52.480\nkinda navigate throughout the calendar\nwithin this little view right here.\n\n197\n00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.080\nThe bottom left hand side,\n\n198\n00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.320\nyou have the different calendars\nthat you might have access to.\n\n199\n00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:03.330\nIn Joey's calendar,\nhe's got a couple of them in here.\n\n200\n00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.050\nYou also should have the holidays and\nthe birthdays.\n\n201\n00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:10.080\nNow birthdays would be associated with,\neither your contacts or\n\n202\n00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.050\nyour global address list, and\nyou can go ahead and start adding them.\n\n203\n00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:19.000\nAnd they've actually added that to\nwhere you could add them yourself.\n\n204\n00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.260\nThe support team, that's something that\nwe've created here at Office Pro Demo Co,\n\n205\n00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.520\nis that Ronnie that uses these accounts as\nwell to demonstrate the different things\n\n206\n00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:33.480\non the administrative side, he went ahead\nand created a group called support team,\n\n207\n00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.290\nand added certain members.\n\n208\n00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.310\nAnd so that's why support team is here.\n\n209\n00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.800\nSo that's part of our groups that I\nhave mentioned in other episodes,\n\n210\n00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.360\nthat we have another episode about.\n\n211\n00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:47.140\nAnd we also have\nJustin Timberlake's calendar.\n\n212\n00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:48.180\nWhy do I have that?\n\n213\n00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.600\nBecause Justin.\n\n214\n00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.900\nWe did a whole episode about sharing or\ndelegating access to accounts.\n\n215\n00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:59.700\nAnd I chose that Justin delegated\naccess to the email and\n\n216\n00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.640\nthe calendar of his account to Joey.\n\n217\n00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.300\nAnd I haven't turned\nthose features off and\n\n218\n00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.540\nhaven't removed any of\nthose access levels.\n\n219\n00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.180\nSo that's why you see that here.\n\n220\n00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.940\nAnd so\nwe have that over on our left hand side.\n\n221\n00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:20.770\nWhen you start getting in to\nthe different pieces in our calendar,\n\n222\n00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.410\nthere's a lot of things to look for.\n\n223\n00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:26.830\nThere's a couple ways you could do it.\n\n224\n00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.940\nLet's do the first way of where\nif you just start hovering\n\n225\n00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.530\nover the different pieces.\n\n226\n00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:35.100\nIf I hover over this meeting,\n\n227\n00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.950\nI know it is, well this is actually\na Skype meeting, I can see about this.\n\n228\n00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.330\nSo I start seeing all of the details.\n\n229\n00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.210\nIt gives me the name, it gives me the\nstart and the end date, and the organizer.\n\n230\n00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.810\nAnd so\nthere's a lot of different icons in here.\n\n231\n00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.000\nFirst is here, if I hover over this one.\n\n232\n00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.020\nThis is a doctor's appointment.\n\n233\n00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.850\nNotice there is a lock on\nthe bottom right hand corner here.\n\n234\n00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:02.915\nThis indicates that this\nis a private appointment.\n\n235\n00:12:02.915 --> 00:12:06.878\nI know this is an appointment, trying to\nuse that terminology, cuz appointments and\n\n236\n00:12:06.878 --> 00:12:10.566\nmeetings, they all kind of blend together,\nbut they do mean specific things,\n\n237\n00:12:10.566 --> 00:12:11.906\ndifferently, in Outlook.\n\n238\n00:12:11.906 --> 00:12:16.370\nThis is an appointment that\nI set as Joey for myself.\n\n239\n00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:20.405\nI made it private,\nbecause if I share out my calendar, or\n\n240\n00:12:20.405 --> 00:12:25.180\nhave people open my calendar,\nif I set it as private,\n\n241\n00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.590\nthey won't see the details,\nthey won't even see doctor's appointment.\n\n242\n00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.380\nThey won't see any of the reminder,\nthey won't see any of the details.\n\n243\n00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.760\nIt will just show private.\n\n244\n00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.280\nSo, you don't see,\nI also set something else here too.\n\n245\n00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.250\nYou won't see the details.\n\n246\n00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.210\nWhat just popped up?\n\n247\n00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.460\nA reminder to say hi to you, Daniel.\n\n248\n00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:44.570\n&gt;&gt; Hi, Vonne.\n\n249\n00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:51.910\n&gt;&gt; This is a reminder that I set on\nan appointment for myself today.\n\n250\n00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:56.350\nAnd that is something you can also set\nin everything is, when to remind me.\n\n251\n00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.160\nAnd I could hit the snooze if I wanted to,\nand\n\n252\n00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:03.430\nI have set this to be five\nminutes before my set time.\n\n253\n00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.550\nI set that, this is at 3:30 today,\nand I was supposed to say hi,\n\n254\n00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:07.700\nhere is my reminder.\n\n255\n00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.750\nI live by these reminders.\n\n256\n00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.550\nAt the university, it was like,\nI was having reminders all day long,\n\n257\n00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.270\nbecause I had a lot of different meetings.\n\n258\n00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.330\nIt was really good,\nlike 15 minutes before the meetings start.\n\n259\n00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.860\nLet me go ahead and gather my notes,\nget everything together.\n\n260\n00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.770\nSo you can snooze it, just like,\nif you think about an alarm on your,\n\n261\n00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.648\nlike hitting it on the side.\n\n262\n00:13:24.648 --> 00:13:26.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not just my phone.\n\n263\n00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:26.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n264\n00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.730\n&gt;&gt; That failed me this morning [LAUGH], so\nI can snooze it, how long to go ahead and\n\n265\n00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.220\nsnooze, or I could dismiss this one.\n\n266\n00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:38.090\nDismiss all would mean that if I had\nmultiple reminders that I'm dismissing\n\n267\n00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:41.090\nall of my reminders or\njust this specific one.\n\n268\n00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.490\nSo reminders are something you can set for\nany of your appointments or\n\n269\n00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.280\nmeetings that you want to remind yourself.\n\n270\n00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.090\nAnd then it's like, are you sure\nyou wanna dismiss all of these?\n\n271\n00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.770\nYes, I do.\nI don't want to have that.\n\n272\n00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:56.630\nSo lots of different things or\nproperties, we'll call them, properties,\n\n273\n00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.760\ndetails, that you can set on your\nappointments and/or meetings.\n\n274\n00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:05.665\nThe private, we talked about,\nthe reminder, you see how some of these,\n\n275\n00:14:05.665 --> 00:14:10.910\nit's kind of small, but over to the left,\nthat would be the other right.\n\n276\n00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:14.330\nSome of them are white and\nsome of them are purple.\n\n277\n00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:19.980\nThose are just different statuses that\nyou can set, of out of the office or,\n\n278\n00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:25.690\nit's free or I am busy, or\ndon't disturb, those types of things.\n\n279\n00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.120\nI don't think there was do not disturb,\n\n280\n00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.660\nI think it's just busy, is the different\nstatuses that you can put through here.\n\n281\n00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.940\nSo you can go ahead and hover over this.\n\n282\n00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.170\nLet's look at some other\nicons on this particular one.\n\n283\n00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:40.380\nNotice on the bottom right-hand corner,\nthere's like a little arrow circly things.\n\n284\n00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.090\nThat's the descriptive terminology.\n\n285\n00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.740\nThat means it's a reoccurring appointment.\n\n286\n00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.720\nActually, this is not an appointment.\n\n287\n00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.870\nThis is a meeting.\n\n288\n00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.230\nHow do I know this is a meeting?\n\n289\n00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.340\nIt says organizer.\n\n290\n00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.800\nWhen there's an organizer attached to it,\n\n291\n00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.160\nthat means that a meeting\nhas multiple people.\n\n292\n00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.180\nAn appointment is something for me.\n\n293\n00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.700\nLike I set it for just me.\n\n294\n00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.380\n&gt;&gt; Just you.\n\n295\n00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.030\n&gt;&gt; A meeting is,\n\n296\n00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:08.690\nI have invited people into this meeting\nand other people are either accepting or\n\n297\n00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:14.040\nrejecting or doing different things to say\nthat, yes, we're all supposed to be here.\n\n298\n00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:19.490\nI know that I am the organizer of it\nbecause it says that I am the organizer,\n\n299\n00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.970\nso all of these different pieces.\n\n300\n00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.110\nUp at the top,\nI did wanna come back up to the view,\n\n301\n00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.100\nbecause these different things we've\ntalked about in other interfaces,\n\n302\n00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.840\nthe email interface,\nwe've also talked about in the context.\n\n303\n00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.100\nThe folder pane is the things to left.\n\n304\n00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.440\nThe reading pane, so normally that's\nthe thing where it reads your emails.\n\n305\n00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:41.170\nIn this case, if you put the reading pane\non, it's going to read the different\n\n306\n00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:46.110\ndetails of the appointment that you\nclick on over in your calendar.\n\n307\n00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.525\nSo you could see the green category apply.\n\n308\n00:15:48.525 --> 00:15:52.454\nI can see that this was addressed or\npeople invited.\n\n309\n00:15:52.454 --> 00:15:54.762\nThere was Lance, Justin, and Chris.\n\n310\n00:15:54.762 --> 00:16:00.545\nI could also see that who has accepted or\nrejected, or I guess I just say declined.\n\n311\n00:16:00.545 --> 00:16:03.711\nOr tentatively accepted\nwithin this meeting and\n\n312\n00:16:03.711 --> 00:16:07.630\nall of the different notes and\nthings that I have.\n\n313\n00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.902\nAnother thing to note is up at the top\nwhen you start clicking on your\n\n314\n00:16:11.902 --> 00:16:16.320\ndifferent items in your calendar\nyou have your contextual tab.\n\n315\n00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.360\nThe contextual tab on your ribbon\nwill let you know what this is.\n\n316\n00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:23.220\nThis says it is a meeting series.\n\n317\n00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.970\nAnd I have different\nbuttons that I am allowed\n\n318\n00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.620\nto click on because this is a meeting.\n\n319\n00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:33.610\nThe reoccurrence, reminder,\nthe show us [INAUDIBLE] the status.\n\n320\n00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:34.580\nThe tracking.\n\n321\n00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:37.580\nAdd or remove attendees.\n\n322\n00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:42.170\nWatch if I click on this particular\nappointment it says, appointment.\n\n323\n00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:42.872\n&gt;&gt; Appointment.\n\n324\n00:16:42.872 --> 00:16:44.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It does.\n\n325\n00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:45.410\nLook at how it does that.\n\n326\n00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.955\n&gt;&gt; I can see that.\n\n327\n00:16:45.955 --> 00:16:47.610\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's so smart.\n\n328\n00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:51.320\nSo this is a different set of\nbuttons on this contextual tab\n\n329\n00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.850\nbecause it's a different item.\n\n330\n00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.020\nIf I click on this, now,\nwhy is this one dimmed down?\n\n331\n00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:02.240\nThis is because it is a meeting\nrequest that was organized by Lance,\n\n332\n00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.520\nI love this reading pane in the calendar.\n\n333\n00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:09.300\nIt was organized by Lance,\nand it's about the tour bus.\n\n334\n00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.264\nAnd this is the day, so\nI have our starting and stoppings, and\n\n335\n00:17:12.264 --> 00:17:14.090\nthis is just between you and me [LAUGH].\n\n336\n00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:17.700\nIt has a high importance too and\nit's private.\n\n337\n00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.910\nSo these are all the different things\nthat Lance set when it's sent to me,\n\n338\n00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.140\nthe thing is, I haven't answered him.\n\n339\n00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.320\nThat's why it's dimmed\ndown on my calendar.\n\n340\n00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:31.100\nIt's like, hey, this is a meeting request,\nthat has been sent to you,\n\n341\n00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.180\nbut you have not replied to it.\n\n342\n00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.010\nAnd that's why I have things like,\naccept, decline.\n\n343\n00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.510\nPropose a new time,\n\n344\n00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:43.160\nbecause that's the property of this\nparticular item on my calendar.\n\n345\n00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:48.450\nSo if it's dimmed, that's why,\nas opposed to the full colors.\n\n346\n00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:49.510\nSo let's see.\n\n347\n00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:51.050\nJust looking at my notes to make sure.\n\n348\n00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.430\nWe have one other one here.\n\n349\n00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.140\nThe VMA performance,\nthe meeting to discuss.\n\n350\n00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.330\nThis is something that came from a group.\n\n351\n00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:02.500\nNotice the organizer is band_boys.\n\n352\n00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.490\nThis is a group that I've\ncreated to go ahead and\n\n353\n00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:11.130\nstart demonstrating groups, and\nwe will go into groups in another episode.\n\n354\n00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:16.240\nSo all of these different\ndetails can be shown\n\n355\n00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:20.700\nthrough the reading pane and\nor the contextual tabs.\n\n356\n00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.070\nAnd if you wanted to open it up and\n\n357\n00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.440\nmaybe cuz I don't want to have the reading\npane open, that's the people pane.\n\n358\n00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.990\nOver here, reading pane,\nand I turn this off.\n\n359\n00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.940\nWhen I get into the details you\ncan open these just like you open\n\n360\n00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.710\nemails you just double click on it.\n\n361\n00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.620\nSo I open this up.\n\n362\n00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.780\nNow this is where if it's your\nreoccurring versus a single instance,\n\n363\n00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.570\nit's going to give you these options.\n\n364\n00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:45.710\nDo I want to open just this one or\ndo I wanna open the entire series?\n\n365\n00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.900\nThat depends so you have\nthe reoccurring meeting such as the VMA\n\n366\n00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.230\nperformance that's going to be every\nmonth that I still haven't accepted.\n\n367\n00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:57.100\nBut maybe I need to make a change on\njust this particular month's meeting,\n\n368\n00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.700\ncuz maybe I need to propose a new time.\n\n369\n00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.880\nSo I'm not gonna be\nthere on that Thursday.\n\n370\n00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:06.230\nAs opposed to the entire series where\nmaybe I need to give it a category.\n\n371\n00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:09.980\nI wanna categorize it as yellow,\ncuz I've made that category.\n\n372\n00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.750\nSo this is where you have\nto determine which part\n\n373\n00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:17.520\nof a recurring appointment or\nmeeting that you want to do.\n\n374\n00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.640\nLet's go with entire series here.\n\n375\n00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.700\nAnd notice that it opens up all\nthe same information that I\n\n376\n00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.320\nwas looking at in those\ndifferent views are here.\n\n377\n00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.180\nAnd then I can get into it and\nstart making changes,\n\n378\n00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.590\nif I needed to, and\nthen saving and closing it.\n\n379\n00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.700\nI don't wanna make any changes right now.\n\n380\n00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.370\nJust showing you the different places and\n\n381\n00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:41.420\ndifferent ways that you can start\ngetting into your calendar.\n\n382\n00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:45.670\nHovering, using the reading pane,\ndouble clicking to go ahead and open it.\n\n383\n00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:51.160\nAll the different places that you can\nstart getting those details out of\n\n384\n00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.540\nyour items.\n\n385\n00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.030\nSo let me look at my notes really quick.\n\n386\n00:19:56.030 --> 00:20:01.840\nLets move over into Lance cuz Lance\nhas a little bit of a different setup.\n\n387\n00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.630\nHe has multiple calendars over here.\n\n388\n00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:07.570\nSo he has his Lance at office pro demo co.\n\n389\n00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.580\nRemember he has, well,\nif you've watched the delegate access\n\n390\n00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.837\nof the sharing mailboxes and\nsharing e-mail accounts.\n\n391\n00:20:13.837 --> 00:20:16.590\nYou could see that he has\naccess to Justin's catalog.\n\n392\n00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:20.590\n&gt;&gt; Calendar?\n&gt;&gt; Thank you [LAUGH].\n\n393\n00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.580\nCalendar, not catalog.\n\n394\n00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.412\nWhat was I doing, comments for contacts?\n\n395\n00:20:25.412 --> 00:20:26.030\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n396\n00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:29.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's just amazing\nhow the mind works sometimes.\n\n397\n00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.470\nSo I have all these other ones too here,\nlook, he has a cat shows calendar.\n\n398\n00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:34.006\n&gt;&gt; That's special.\n\n399\n00:20:34.006 --> 00:20:34.719\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is.\n\n400\n00:20:34.719 --> 00:20:37.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] He's going to watch cat\nshows like they're going out of style.\n\n401\n00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:39.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So he's gonna have a whole calendar\n\n402\n00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:40.220\ndevoted-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n403\n00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:40.785\n&gt;&gt; To this cat show.\n\n404\n00:20:40.785 --> 00:20:41.820\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And he might not wanna\n\n405\n00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.010\nreally put that in with his work calendar.\n\n406\n00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.680\n&gt;&gt; True.\n&gt;&gt; But it's something that he would\n\n407\n00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.340\nlike to keep to keep himself organized and\nhe uses Outlook throughout everything.\n\n408\n00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:54.119\nSo you could go ahead and\ncreate a separate calendar to well,\n\n409\n00:20:54.119 --> 00:20:56.871\nkeep your cat shows\ncalendar if you want to.\n\n410\n00:20:56.871 --> 00:21:00.436\n&gt;&gt; If you guys were out there working\nin any kind of corporate environment,\n\n411\n00:21:00.436 --> 00:21:03.717\na business, these calendars do\nget cluttered up pretty quickly.\n\n412\n00:21:03.717 --> 00:21:07.662\nAnd Microsoft does a great job trying to\nkeep these things separated making it easy\n\n413\n00:21:07.662 --> 00:21:09.120\nand organizable.\n\n414\n00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.750\nBut, eventually, you're just gonna\noverwhelm it and overwhelm yourself.\n\n415\n00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.970\nSo, breaking it up into multiple counters,\n\n416\n00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:20.635\ncan be a great way of reorganizing\nthat to make it easier to look at.\n\n417\n00:21:20.635 --> 00:21:25.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I even know on my phone,\nwhen I'm using my phone calendar.\n\n418\n00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.040\nIt'll say, do you want to add\nthis to your Gmail account?\n\n419\n00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.230\nOr do you want to add this\nto your iPhone calendar?\n\n420\n00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:33.345\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Your iCalendar and well,\n\n421\n00:21:33.345 --> 00:21:38.150\nwhen I was at the university and\nwe all used shared Google Calendars.\n\n422\n00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:42.490\nThere is things I didn't really want my\nwork people to see on my Google Calendar,\n\n423\n00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:44.090\nbecause I shared it out to them.\n\n424\n00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.660\nI used those different calendars for\ndifferent reasons.\n\n425\n00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:50.096\n&gt;&gt; Dentist appointment probably not going\nto make it to your business side of your\n\n426\n00:21:50.096 --> 00:21:50.623\ncalendar.\n\n427\n00:21:50.623 --> 00:21:53.490\n&gt;&gt; No that I'm going to\nthe beach every weekend.\n\n428\n00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:57.330\nI'll just keep that to\nmyself because then they're\n\n429\n00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:01.980\njust going to start getting jealous\n[LAUGH] those types of things.\n\n430\n00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.410\nSo with Lance he has his cat shows.\n\n431\n00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.390\nIf I want to see that\nyou have check boxes.\n\n432\n00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:10.390\nSo notice I can open up another calendar\nand so over on the cat shows maybe I don't\n\n433\n00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:14.610\nwant to see my work calendar\nright now then I uncheck that.\n\n434\n00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.430\nAnd so I can see that.\n\n435\n00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.450\nWe have the Persian Parade\ncoming up really soon.\n\n436\n00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:20.671\n&gt;&gt; I look forward to that every year.\n\n437\n00:22:20.671 --> 00:22:23.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Its a monthly.\n\n438\n00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.554\n&gt;&gt; Yes, look at the calendar.\n\n439\n00:22:24.554 --> 00:22:26.450\n&gt;&gt; That's right it is a recurring monthly.\n\n440\n00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:27.960\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of behind\nmy head a little bit.\n\n441\n00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.420\nBut you can say that the Persian parade.\n\n442\n00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:30.270\n&gt;&gt; Persian parade.\n\n443\n00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's the first\nFriday of every month and\n\n444\n00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:36.840\nthe Tom Cat Tuesdays and\nthe Siamese Sundays.\n\n445\n00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.355\nYes, I had a grand old time making\nthis up in my own little mind.\n\n446\n00:22:41.355 --> 00:22:44.510\n[LAUGH] Like okay-\n&gt;&gt; Yvonne just doesn't understand why\n\n447\n00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:45.775\nthese aren't real things.\n\n448\n00:22:45.775 --> 00:22:48.450\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, well I do remember going\n\n449\n00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:53.620\nto cat shows when I was little as part\nof the girls, it was like girls scouts.\n\n450\n00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:57.680\nYeah, and I think the troop leader\nwas really into cat shows and so\n\n451\n00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:01.770\nwe would go and like help out with\nthe cats and clean up the cat show.\n\n452\n00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.600\nYeah, it is a-\n&gt;&gt; It's a real thing.\n\n453\n00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.312\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is so serious.\n\n454\n00:23:07.312 --> 00:23:08.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n455\n00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:09.205\n&gt;&gt; For real, yeah.\n\n456\n00:23:09.205 --> 00:23:10.880\n&gt;&gt; You'll have to [INAUDIBLE].\n\n457\n00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As soon as this episode's over,\n\n458\n00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.273\nI'm going online to look at cat shows now.\n\n459\n00:23:15.273 --> 00:23:15.957\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n460\n00:23:15.957 --> 00:23:16.790\n&gt;&gt; I have to see this.\n\n461\n00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:19.165\n&gt;&gt; It's a whole world,\nit's very interesting, so.\n\n462\n00:23:19.165 --> 00:23:21.291\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean, I love cats, I'm just,\n\n463\n00:23:21.291 --> 00:23:22.672\nthis is so cool [LAUGH].\n\n464\n00:23:22.672 --> 00:23:24.971\nAnyway, I talking to you about that Lance,\n\n465\n00:23:24.971 --> 00:23:29.790\ndoesn't want everybody seeing that he goes\nto Tom Cat Tuesdays on his work calendar.\n\n466\n00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:32.220\nThat's why he separated it out and\nyou can make it.\n\n467\n00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:36.320\nNow down, a little bit lower,\nwe have some shared calendars over here.\n\n468\n00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.800\nNow we have it just in here,\nand we also have it down here.\n\n469\n00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.510\nThere's differences between a shared\ncalendar and an open calendar.\n\n470\n00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.100\nLet me explain.\n\n471\n00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.740\nWe've talked a lot about Exchange Servers\nthroughout this entire show.\n\n472\n00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:56.828\nSo everybody here in Office Pro demo co is\non the same networks, on the same server.\n\n473\n00:23:56.828 --> 00:24:00.574\nSo as a person within this organization,\n\n474\n00:24:00.574 --> 00:24:04.747\nI could come up over here\nto Open Calendar, and\n\n475\n00:24:04.747 --> 00:24:10.110\nI can open anybody's calendar\nin the global address list.\n\n476\n00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.150\nAnd I would do this at\nthe university all the time,\n\n477\n00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:16.680\nbecause there was a lot of people that\nI would have to be associated with.\n\n478\n00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.430\nSo I would go in and\nI would open up their calendars.\n\n479\n00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.150\nNow that's just seeing it.\n\n480\n00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:25.300\nBut I could not change anything in\ntheir calendars, I couldn't see their\n\n481\n00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:30.520\nprivate information, but at least as I'm\ntrying to get a couple different directors\n\n482\n00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.249\ninto a meeting, I could just look at\ntheir calendars side by side and say,\n\n483\n00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:39.640\nthat person's on vacation for a month or\nthat person's out of the country or\n\n484\n00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.810\nfor the summer, those types of things,\nor on sabbatical.\n\n485\n00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:46.670\nI could go ahead and see all of those\nfeatures, but you can't touch them.\n\n486\n00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:53.040\nSo opening a calendar within your\nExchange network, that's okay.\n\n487\n00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.350\nWhen you share a calendar,\nnotice here I could share a calendar\n\n488\n00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:00.920\njust like we talked about in the context\nsession, if you look at that,\n\n489\n00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.130\nthere's an episode called share and\ntransfer contacts.\n\n490\n00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.960\nSo I could share this out with\nsomebody else in my network,\n\n491\n00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.150\nand I can request them to\nshare out their calendar.\n\n492\n00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:14.260\nAnd then I can have different\npermission levels of whether or\n\n493\n00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:18.870\nnot I can change any of their information,\nor I can just view it.\n\n494\n00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:21.670\nSo, sharing and opening,\nthey look similar and\n\n495\n00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:25.380\nthey kind of go under this category over\nhere, but they are a little bit different.\n\n496\n00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:29.780\nI'm going to check the boxes for Joey and\nI'm going to check the boxes for Justin.\n\n497\n00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.520\nI'm going to turn off\nthe cat show over here.\n\n498\n00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n499\n00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:39.230\nif I look at Joey's calendar as Lance,\nI could say well let me look at this one.\n\n500\n00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.040\nNotice it says when I\ntry to double click it,\n\n501\n00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.710\nyou do not have permission\nto view this calendar.\n\n502\n00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:48.710\nBut do you want to ask Joey for\npermission?\n\n503\n00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:50.140\nI'm going to say no for this one.\n\n504\n00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:54.980\nAs opposed to Justin Timberlake, Justin\nTimberlake gave me access to his calendar.\n\n505\n00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.090\nSo it I double clicked over here on\nJune 2nd, that's, yes that's true.\n\n506\n00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:04.320\nNotices it opens up into a windows where\nI can start creating an appointment for\n\n507\n00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.990\nJustin because he have me\nthat access to his calendar.\n\n508\n00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:14.780\nSo all of the different ways that\nyou can use that calendar interface.\n\n509\n00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.690\nLet's turn off these shared calendars,\n\n510\n00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:22.310\nnotice that it automatically turns\non my default calendar here.\n\n511\n00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:25.280\nI did mention those options\nin the beginning of the show,\n\n512\n00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.780\nlike what if my work week is\nnot Monday through Friday?\n\n513\n00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.490\nWhat if my time is not eight to five?\n\n514\n00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:33.890\nIf you go into the File tab,\nyou come into the Options,\n\n515\n00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:37.090\nwe've been here quite a few\ntimes throughout this show.\n\n516\n00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:42.740\nWhere do you think we're going to go to if\nwe're talking about our calendar options?\n\n517\n00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.752\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to say language.\n\n518\n00:26:44.752 --> 00:26:46.658\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And that would be wrong.\n\n519\n00:26:46.658 --> 00:26:49.200\n&gt;&gt; Wrong.\n[LAUGH] Like some weird stroke of events,\n\n520\n00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.294\nso this is actually,\nno I'm kidding it's on the calendar.\n\n521\n00:26:51.294 --> 00:26:53.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's the calendar right here.\n\n522\n00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:57.660\nSo this is where you can set the settings\nfor your different meetings,\n\n523\n00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.420\nand time zones.\n\n524\n00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.780\nMaybe you're working with a lot of\npeople over on the West Coast, or\n\n525\n00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:06.050\nmaybe over in China, or India, and\n\n526\n00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:09.220\nyou need to make sure that you know,\nif you're trying to schedule meetings,\n\n527\n00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:13.620\nyou should see what their time is, and\nhow it correlates I'll show you that.\n\n528\n00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.920\nSo where do you want my start time to be?\n\n529\n00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.670\nWhat are my work weeks?\n\n530\n00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:19.080\nWhat is the first day of my week?\n\n531\n00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.950\nIt's Sunday.\n\n532\n00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.040\nMaybe I don't want to be Sunday.\n\n533\n00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.740\nI know a lot of times\nwhen I do my iCalendars,\n\n534\n00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.650\nI really want it to be on Monday, so\nI always want the weekends to be on\n\n535\n00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:30.000\nthe side, because that's where\nI walk out on my weekend.\n\n536\n00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.410\nWhat is the first day of the year?\n\n537\n00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:34.360\nWell, fiscal calendars.\n\n538\n00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:34.870\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n539\n00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:35.560\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n540\n00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.980\nYeah.\nIf you work on a fiscal calendar, and\n\n541\n00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.110\nthat's, that's what your,\nthat is your year.\n\n542\n00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.340\nDoesn't matter what January is.\n\n543\n00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.090\nYou can see the default reminders.\n\n544\n00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:50.000\nAdding holidays into your calendar, that's\ndifferent than having a separate calendar.\n\n545\n00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.320\nOnce you add them in, and\nI actually remember when you add them in,\n\n546\n00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.820\nit was hard to get rid of them.\n\n547\n00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.860\nI've Googled this and it was back in the\nday, how do you actually get rid of it?\n\n548\n00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:00.960\nIt's been some time,\n\n549\n00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.390\nbut I'm pretty sure that's why they\nseparate it out into US holidays.\n\n550\n00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:09.750\nTo where you don't have to add them all\nin and want to get rid of them all.\n\n551\n00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:10.700\nSo you can add but\n\n552\n00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:15.850\nif you wanted to, you can import which\nyou want to say into default calendar.\n\n553\n00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:18.850\nYou also have this different\ncolors that we were talking about.\n\n554\n00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:22.480\nScroll on down a litter bit further,\nthis is the time zone.\n\n555\n00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.830\nSo we're in Eastern Time,\nbecause we're in Gainesville, Florida.\n\n556\n00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:27.745\nBut if I wanted to show\na second time zone,\n\n557\n00:28:27.745 --> 00:28:31.220\nbecause I would like to\nhave it over in California.\n\n558\n00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.350\nWe'll just say, Cali to be cool.\n\n559\n00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.440\nSo what is California?\n\n560\n00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:41.560\nThey are in Pacific Time, and that's what\nI'd like to show a second time zone.\n\n561\n00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.300\nAnd the other thing is the weather.\n\n562\n00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.650\nMaybe you don't want to see what\nthe weather is on your calendar.\n\n563\n00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:46.770\nYou can turn it off.\n\n564\n00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:47.600\nI kind of like it.\n\n565\n00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.630\nIt's cute, so we'll click okay.\n\n566\n00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:51.190\nNow I'm changed it.\n\n567\n00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.830\nWell okay,\nnow where's that other timezone?\n\n568\n00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:54.690\nI don't see it.\n\n569\n00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:56.620\nYou're not going to see\nit in the month view.\n\n570\n00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:01.340\nYou will see it in the week view,\nthe work week view and\n\n571\n00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.570\nthe day view, and so no month view.\n\n572\n00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.790\nSo if you've set it, and\nyou don't think it happened, it did.\n\n573\n00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:13.240\nSo now, you can see that it is 12 PM in\nGainesville, but it is 9 AM in California.\n\n574\n00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.120\nSo I like those timezones.\n\n575\n00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.980\nIt gives you some different variations for\nmaybe clients that are in that place.\n\n576\n00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:23.100\nLast little bit, printing your calendar.\n\n577\n00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:28.220\nIf you wanted, you can come over\nto your file, you go to Print,\n\n578\n00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:35.133\ndepending on what day you had selected is\nwhere you can go into the daily style,\n\n579\n00:29:35.133 --> 00:29:37.744\nweekly, monthly.\n\n580\n00:29:37.744 --> 00:29:40.680\nI'll tell you that [LAUGH] I do this.\n\n581\n00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.350\nI actually make new calendars,\nI keep them completely blank, and\n\n582\n00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.265\nI print them out, and then I physically\nwrite them on a piece of paper.\n\n583\n00:29:47.265 --> 00:29:50.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's just my way.\n\n584\n00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.965\n&gt;&gt; Old habits die hard.\n\n585\n00:29:51.965 --> 00:29:55.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, it's just the way\nI would do it for a long time, and\n\n586\n00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:59.040\nthen I'd staple them altogether and\nput them in my filing cabinet.\n\n587\n00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.880\nAnd I have all this technology, at my\nfingertips literally on my phone, and\n\n588\n00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.970\nI still print them out.\n\n589\n00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.160\n&gt;&gt; That reminds me of Miss Headbury,\n\n590\n00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.409\nwho said people with flyers\nit's like saying here.\n\n591\n00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.380\nFeel this way for me.\n\n592\n00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.600\n&gt;&gt; Exactly It's just I can't help it so,\nbut\n\n593\n00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:19.650\nif you wanted to print your calendar\nthat's where you go to do it and so\n\n594\n00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:24.750\nbeing from, there's a lot of pieces\nwithin the calendar interface so that's\n\n595\n00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:28.430\nwhy I wanted to take this episode just to\nkinda get you familiar with everything.\n\n596\n00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:32.520\nClicking on stuff, know what's going\non and then will going to go ahead and\n\n597\n00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.020\ndive into creating our appointment,\ncreating our meaning,\n\n598\n00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:40.420\nmoving our meanings and then how to\nshare our calendar so more to come.\n\n599\n00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:45.060\n&gt;&gt; That sounds awesome, I know there are\ngood audience probably looking a lot for\n\n600\n00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:49.350\nto that and I will say that a good email,\n\n601\n00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:54.860\na client worth its salt, really is tested\nand tried by how well the calendar and\n\n602\n00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:59.570\nthe email portion of that functionality\nworks together, and Outlook does a great\n\n603\n00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:03.530\njob of doing that just being able to put\nin an item and it shows up in email.\n\n604\n00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:05.600\nYou can send emails from the calendar,\n\n605\n00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.250\nyou can add items to\nthe calendar from email events.\n\n606\n00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:12.560\nIt's very, very intertwined and very\ninterconnected and it works super well.\n\n607\n00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.380\nIt's the unsung hero of Outlook that's for\nsure.\n\n608\n00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Vonne you've definitely got\n\n609\n00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.750\nus acclimated to the calendar waters.\n\n610\n00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:22.020\nWe appreciate that, but looking at\nthat clock and it's that time again.\n\n611\n00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.660\n&gt;&gt; It's that time.\n&gt;&gt; Time for us to sign off.\n\n612\n00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.660\nFor Office ProTV,\nwe do thank you for watching.\n\n613\n00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:26.950\nI've been your host Daniel

host, Wes Bryan, and we got\na great show for you in store today.\n\n4\n00:00:11.112 --> 00:00:14.781\nAnd joining us back in the studios is\nOfficeProTV's very own Vonne Smith,\n\n5\n00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:15.960\nhow you doing, Vonne?\n\n6\n00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.770\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great,\nready to make some appointments.\n\n7\n00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.310\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n8\n00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.610\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's what we're going to\nbe concentrating on in this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.239\nSo we took some time getting familiar\nwith the calendar interface, and\n\n10\n00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.139\nnow we're gonna go ahead and\nstart using the calendar and\n\n11\n00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:30.907\nstart scheduling appointments.\n\n12\n00:00:30.907 --> 00:00:34.034\nCuz it's going to be very important\nto keep your life in order,\n\n13\n00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:37.855\nmake sure you've got to know where\nyou're supposed to be at all times.\n\n14\n00:00:37.855 --> 00:00:41.226\nI know I struggle with that every\nday a little bit there, Wes.\n\n15\n00:00:41.226 --> 00:00:43.089\nI'm like, what am I doing today?\n\n16\n00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:44.057\nWhat is my purpose?\n\n17\n00:00:44.057 --> 00:00:45.353\nWhere am I going [LAUGH]?\n\n18\n00:00:45.353 --> 00:00:48.455\n&gt;&gt; I would say that if I didn't\nhave a neck, I'd forget my head.\n\n19\n00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:50.275\nSo it's a good design, great design.\n\n20\n00:00:50.275 --> 00:00:51.625\nSo when it comes to appointments,\n\n21\n00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:54.080\nwhat are we gonna see here\nwhen it comes to creating it?\n\n22\n00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.100\nWell we're gonna do all of the different\ndetails like what is the appointment\n\n23\n00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.010\nabout, where is it going to be, and any\ntype of notes that I might need to add.\n\n24\n00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.800\nAnd if you've worked with appointments or\na calendar on your phone,\n\n25\n00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.560\nI mean I know we all live on our phones.\n\n26\n00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.760\nIf you've scheduled it on your Android or\n\n27\n00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.950\nyour iPhone, it's pretty much\nthe same thing in Outlook.\n\n28\n00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.810\nIt's just that Outlook is going to\nbe a lot more robust of what it's\n\n29\n00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.150\ngoing to be able to do.\n\n30\n00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.652\nBut now appointments, to be specific,\nare going to be for us.\n\n31\n00:01:19.652 --> 00:01:25.940\nWe put it to where we're the only person\nreally invited to the party to say.\n\n32\n00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.680\nNow of course, you could have this as\nan appointment that you're going to be\n\n33\n00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.110\nmeeting somebody, but it's different\nthan a meeting, per se, in Outlook.\n\n34\n00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.900\nSo if you schedule a meeting,\nyou're going to be inviting attendees.\n\n35\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.710\nAnd then, of course, that interacts with\nhow that's going to email people and\n\n36\n00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.568\nput it on your calendars, and\nthen put it on the invitees, or\n\n37\n00:01:45.568 --> 00:01:48.080\nattendees` [LAUGH]\nthe people you're inviting.\n\n38\n00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.760\nIt puts it on their calendar and all of\nthat robustness of what makes Office and\n\n39\n00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.020\nOutlook, specifically, so great to use\nto organize those types of things.\n\n40\n00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.360\nBut appointments are going to go on our\ncalendar, only our calendar, and so\n\n41\n00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.310\nit reminds us.\n\n42\n00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.791\nSo let's just jump down\ninto Joey's calendar.\n\n43\n00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:10.401\nAnd actually I left it right here just\nto make sure that we had that reminder,\n\n44\n00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:13.932\nbecause I had already scheduled a,\nI think it's, well,\n\n45\n00:02:13.932 --> 00:02:16.901\nit says it's a meeting right there,\nWes [LAUGH].\n\n46\n00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:18.875\nSo I was like, is this an appointment or\nis this a meeting?\n\n47\n00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:22.945\nBut thankfully, it let's us know that,\nhey, this is a reminder.\n\n48\n00:02:22.945 --> 00:02:27.935\nIt's like an alarm clock that I set on\nthis particular meeting to let me know,\n\n49\n00:02:27.935 --> 00:02:29.115\nhey, it's time to go.\n\n50\n00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:31.555\nIt's 21 minutes overdue right now,\nso hey, guess what?\n\n51\n00:02:31.555 --> 00:02:34.487\nI'm late [LAUGH] to the marketing meeting.\n\n52\n00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:37.597\nBut we had had that come up\nin the calendar interface, so\n\n53\n00:02:37.597 --> 00:02:39.817\nanytime you schedule an appointment or\na meeting,\n\n54\n00:02:39.817 --> 00:02:45.197\nyou can put in that alarm clock,\nthat reminder to tell me hey,\n\n55\n00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:48.629\nI need to make sure I'm supposted to\nbe there at that particular time.\n\n56\n00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.497\nAnd then, of course,\nthe good old snooze button.\n\n57\n00:02:50.497 --> 00:02:53.327\nI don't know how many times I hit that\nsnooze button every morning, Wes.\n\n58\n00:02:53.327 --> 00:02:56.540\nI have five different alarms and\nI have all the snoozes,\n\n59\n00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.230\nand hopefully they coincide to get\nme actually out of bed [LAUGH].\n\n60\n00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.036\n&gt;&gt; The only time I've seen a snooze button\nwork is when I set it on the other side of\n\n61\n00:03:05.036 --> 00:03:05.925\nthe house [LAUGH].\n\n62\n00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:07.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] exactly,\nI would have two alarm clocks.\n\n63\n00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.156\nAnd now, yeah, and that phone,\nthat stop button and\n\n64\n00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:13.040\nthe snooze button are kinda close\ntogether, I don't like that.\n\n65\n00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.040\nI think they need to change that iPhone.\n\n66\n00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.930\nOkay, so we have our meeting reminder, and\nthen I'm going to go ahead and dismiss.\n\n67\n00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.500\nDismiss and dismiss all at this point\ndoesn't really make a difference,\n\n68\n00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.020\nbecause there's only one\nreminder that I have set here.\n\n69\n00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.830\nSo I'll just go ahead and\nclick dismiss all.\n\n70\n00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.540\nIt's just hey,\n\n71\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.330\nare you sure you want to make sure\nthat I'm gonna stop reminding you.\n\n72\n00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.090\nThat's okay, thank you,\nOutlook, for letting me know.\n\n73\n00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.878\nAnd yep, I'm 21 minutes overdue anyways,\nso I'm good.\n\n74\n00:03:36.878 --> 00:03:40.000\nOkay, so I'm actually in\nthe email section right now.\n\n75\n00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.540\nLet's switch over into our calendar,\njump into here.\n\n76\n00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.695\nYou can see that today at\nthe time of this filming,\n\n77\n00:03:46.695 --> 00:03:50.314\nwe had a marketing meeting\nat 9:30 in Bob's office.\n\n78\n00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:53.650\nAnd so that was something that was set,\nand it was reminding me.\n\n79\n00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.670\nThis is actually a reoccurring meeting.\n\n80\n00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.280\nAnd that's another thing that we're\ngoing to be doing with appointments.\n\n81\n00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.400\nIs this a single time appointment that\nI only need to have on the schedule for\n\n82\n00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.990\none time, or\n\n83\n00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.450\nis this something that happens every other\nweek, every other month, every year?\n\n84\n00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.490\nWhat time and what occurrences do I\nneed to set on these appointments?\n\n85\n00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.600\nSo how do I make an appointment?\n\n86\n00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.640\nThere's a couple different ways,\n\n87\n00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.398\njust like everything in any of our\nOutlook or Office products I would say.\n\n88\n00:04:20.398 --> 00:04:22.670\nYou can right-click, you can double click,\nyou can click on a button.\n\n89\n00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.140\nYou can run around the block and\nthen stand on your head,\n\n90\n00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.070\nand you can go ahead and\nmake it that way, too.\n\n91\n00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.820\nSo the different ways that we can make\nan appointment would be up on the ribbon,\n\n92\n00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.870\nthat's in the Home tab, we can go\nahead and make a new appointment here.\n\n93\n00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.900\nNotice, appointment, meeting,\ntwo different things.\n\n94\n00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.470\nI could also find the date that I want to\nhave that appointment to be created on.\n\n95\n00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.240\nAnd I could right-click,\nor I could double click.\n\n96\n00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.400\nSo all the different ways.\n\n97\n00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.188\nLet's pick a date, let's go with June 7th,\nthat sounds perfect.\n\n98\n00:04:52.188 --> 00:04:56.490\nSo selecting the date, I can,\nnow notice when I single click,\n\n99\n00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.030\nit does actually give me a little\npoint where I could start typing.\n\n100\n00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.330\nI don't want to use this method, so I'm\njust going to go ahead and click off it.\n\n101\n00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.029\nSo if you're gonna right-click,\nmake sure you right-click right away,\n\n102\n00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:08.915\nnot left click, then right-click.\n\n103\n00:05:08.915 --> 00:05:11.890\nCuz did you see when I did that,\nit did something completely different?\n\n104\n00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.750\nSo on here, I wanted to right-click and\nsay I can make a new appointment.\n\n105\n00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.810\nSince I'm right here,\nlet's go ahead and do that.\n\n106\n00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.310\nOpens up the new appointment dialog box,\n\n107\n00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.850\njust like if you opened up a new email,\nit brings up the new mail dialog.\n\n108\n00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.841\nWell, this would be a window,\nI guess I would say.\n\n109\n00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.310\nIt's this thing that opens up,\nhow about that?\n\n110\n00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.160\nOkay, so now the subject,\nwhat is the subject of my appointment?\n\n111\n00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.780\nSo this is June 7th, we're going to a\nlunch date, so we're going to have a lunch\n\n112\n00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.710\nwith, we'll go with JC,\nand now the location.\n\n113\n00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.780\nMaybe there's a specific restaurant\nthat you're going to be meeting at.\n\n114\n00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.720\nYou're going to be meeting\nat Pizano's Pizza.\n\n115\n00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.935\nWhy is it always go back to pizza,\nWes [LAUGH]?\n\n116\n00:05:54.935 --> 00:05:59.026\nSo we're gonna be meeting at Pizano's,\nand notice the start time.\n\n117\n00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:03.240\nNow this is just a single day appointment,\nactually a single time.\n\n118\n00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.990\nBut of course,\nyou might have an appointment,\n\n119\n00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.310\nmaybe you're going to a conference\nthat spans across a couple days.\n\n120\n00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.580\nSo your start and end time, that's where\nyou designate your start and end time.\n\n121\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.280\nWhen am I going?\n\n122\n00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.282\nAnd if it's just a single appointment\nthat's only going to be for\n\n123\n00:06:17.282 --> 00:06:20.229\na couple hours, the same start and\nend time is going to be there,\n\n124\n00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.102\nthe date in there is going to be the same.\n\n125\n00:06:22.102 --> 00:06:25.273\nBut then over here, you have your\ndifferent fields of where you can set\n\n126\n00:06:25.273 --> 00:06:27.286\nthe times of when it starts and\nwhen it ends.\n\n127\n00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:29.950\nWe're gonna be doing a little\nbit of an early lunch, so\n\n128\n00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.060\nwe're gonna be meeting at 11 AM.\n\n129\n00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.810\nAnd usually, when I have lunch with JC,\n\n130\n00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.470\nbecause remember, I'm Joey right now,\nit usually goes a little long.\n\n131\n00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.710\nSo I wanna make sure that I set\nenough time, cuz we need to catch up.\n\n132\n00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.820\nSo I'm gonna set this to be two hours.\n\n133\n00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.760\nNotice that the dropdown options do\ngive you in half-hour increments.\n\n134\n00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.860\nIf you were meeting at 11:15,\nyou can come into the field,\n\n135\n00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.770\nclick your cursor, get your flashing\ncursor where it needs to be.\n\n136\n00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.960\nAnd you can go ahead and\ntype in 11:15 if you need to.\n\n137\n00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.880\nIt doesn't have to be on the top or\nthe middle of the hour,\n\n138\n00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.680\nyou could put it to wherever you want.\n\n139\n00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.630\nAnd then the same thing with the ending\ntime, you could set that as well.\n\n140\n00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:15.320\nSo, but we will go ahead and keep it\nas a two hour duration appointment.\n\n141\n00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.230\nNotice if it was an all day appointment,\nmaybe I was going to that\n\n142\n00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.310\nconference that we'll be away for one,\ntwo, three days, you check that box off.\n\n143\n00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.190\nAnd notice that those fields\nover there on the side,\n\n144\n00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.446\nthey gray out a little bit because well,\nthere are no times, per se.\n\n145\n00:07:29.446 --> 00:07:31.220\nIt's just gonna be an entire day event, so\n\n146\n00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.050\nit's gonna show in your calendar as\nblocked off for that entire day.\n\n147\n00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.690\nWe're gonna uncheck that and\nI'm gonna zoom out a little bit.\n\n148\n00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.426\nSo these are the different places or\ndifferent fields that come up by default.\n\n149\n00:07:43.426 --> 00:07:46.752\nDown in this big box at the bottom,\nthis is where you can add notes.\n\n150\n00:07:46.752 --> 00:07:52.512\nMaybe I need to make a note to myself\nlike bring pictures of new tour bus,\n\n151\n00:07:52.512 --> 00:07:55.109\nwhatever I want to put in there.\n\n152\n00:07:55.109 --> 00:07:57.209\nAnd all of these other ribbons, or\n\n153\n00:07:57.209 --> 00:08:00.693\nother tabs on our ribbons\nacross the top that are Insert.\n\n154\n00:08:00.693 --> 00:08:03.109\nThis is where you could insert all\nof the things we talked about,\n\n155\n00:08:03.109 --> 00:08:04.607\nwhere we could do things in your Email.\n\n156\n00:08:04.607 --> 00:08:07.158\nYou could do here in\nyour Appointment notes.\n\n157\n00:08:07.158 --> 00:08:10.250\nYou could insert a table,\nyou could insert an icon.\n\n158\n00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.450\nYou could go ahead, and put in your\nquick parts that we talked about.\n\n159\n00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.970\nYou can format your text\nto your heart's content.\n\n160\n00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.211\nAnd then, you can review to make sure\nyou got your spelling and grammar,\n\n161\n00:08:19.211 --> 00:08:20.712\nbecause I always need to do that.\n\n162\n00:08:20.712 --> 00:08:24.720\nSo you could go through all of your\ndifferent tabs and edit your notes.\n\n163\n00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.180\nJust like you would any other text or\ndocument within Outlook, or\n\n164\n00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.790\nWord, or what have you.\n\n165\n00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.380\nSo those are the ones that\nare going across the top.\n\n166\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:38.800\nLet's go over a couple other things on\nthis Appointment tab that comes up.\n\n167\n00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.566\nWe have the Scheduling Assistant.\n\n168\n00:08:40.566 --> 00:08:44.650\nNow we don't need to worry about that,\nbecause we're not doing a meeting, okay.\n\n169\n00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.190\nWhen we get into meetings\nin our other episode,\n\n170\n00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.700\nwe'll talk about the importance of\nwhat a schedule assistant will be.\n\n171\n00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.266\nWe're not doing a Skype meeting,\nwe're not doing any meeting notes for\n\n172\n00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:54.075\nthis particular one.\n\n173\n00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:58.105\nI will cover what these are in\nanother episode, and invite attendees.\n\n174\n00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:00.775\nAgain, all of these things are for\nmeetings.\n\n175\n00:09:00.775 --> 00:09:04.505\nMy appointment doesn't have anybody\nelse that I'm going to be including,\n\n176\n00:09:04.505 --> 00:09:06.365\nlike we've talked about in\nthe beginning of the show.\n\n177\n00:09:06.365 --> 00:09:09.215\nSo I don't need to worry about\nany of these buttons right now.\n\n178\n00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:10.535\nShow as.\n\n179\n00:09:10.535 --> 00:09:12.766\nShow as would be, it's like a status.\n\n180\n00:09:12.766 --> 00:09:14.825\nWhat it's gonna show on your calendar.\n\n181\n00:09:14.825 --> 00:09:18.655\nBecause remember, with our calendars you\ncould be sharing them with other people,\n\n182\n00:09:18.655 --> 00:09:21.100\nwhich we have a whole episode about that.\n\n183\n00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.910\nAnd how people are going to be able to\nsee these on your calendar as free,\n\n184\n00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.150\nbusy, out of the office,\nworking elsewhere.\n\n185\n00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.780\nThat's something that's\na little bit newer.\n\n186\n00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.440\nI don't think I've ever seen that one,\nlike back in the day.\n\n187\n00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.060\nWhat was it 2013 and stuff?\n\n188\n00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.725\n&gt;&gt; No I'm not exactly sure on that one.\n\n189\n00:09:37.725 --> 00:09:39.000\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I'm pretty sure we didn't see\n\n190\n00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000\nworking elsewhere.\n\n191\n00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.722\nSo that's a little bit of a newer\nstatus item that's on there.\n\n192\n00:09:42.722 --> 00:09:43.880\nSo I like that.\n\n193\n00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.080\nBecause it's not that\nI'm out of the office,\n\n194\n00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.100\nlike out of the office not working,\nI'm actually working elsewhere.\n\n195\n00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:55.053\nSo, I'm kinda glad that they add that\nas part of their show as my statuses.\n\n196\n00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:57.264\nSo, I could say that I\nam out of the office,\n\n197\n00:09:57.264 --> 00:09:59.610\ncuz this is going to be a lunch meeting.\n\n198\n00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.290\nAnd while we're working,\nwe're eating pizza, so\n\n199\n00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.530\nwe're gonna be out of the office.\n\n200\n00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:09.368\nThis is that reminder that I could set for\nmyself as, by default it's at 15 minutes.\n\n201\n00:10:09.368 --> 00:10:13.700\nNow you can reset this in your\nOptions if you want to say,\n\n202\n00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.580\nI want all my reminders to always be 30\nminutes, because I'm always changing that.\n\n203\n00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.290\nSo the default settings could be managed,\nif you wanted to.\n\n204\n00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.070\nBut maybe I wanted to put\nthose as 30 minutes before,\n\n205\n00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.570\nbecause I wanna make sure I\ngive myself plenty of time.\n\n206\n00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:27.949\nHit that Snooze button\na couple of times too.\n\n207\n00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.150\nAnd so over here,\nwe also have how to categorize this.\n\n208\n00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:36.910\nWe talk a lot about how we can organize,\ncustomize, and search.\n\n209\n00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.560\nYey, I have to do that every time.\n\n210\n00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.700\n[LAUGH] So in our emails, the same thing\nhere with categorizing our appointments.\n\n211\n00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.790\nWhat did these colors mean to you?\n\n212\n00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.609\nAnd this is associated with a band,\nso maybe I'll go ahead and\n\n213\n00:10:48.609 --> 00:10:50.028\nthrow a band category on that.\n\n214\n00:10:50.028 --> 00:10:53.430\nSo I can use that in my search\nof all of my Outlook items.\n\n215\n00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.170\nTo make sure I'm organized, and\n\n216\n00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.890\nthis particular appointment is in that\ncategory that means something to me.\n\n217\n00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.660\n&gt;&gt; And Vonne, let's say that the tour\nbus here was supposed to be a surprise.\n\n218\n00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.844\nThis is a brand new tour bus.\n\n219\n00:11:02.844 --> 00:11:04.265\nAnd we don't want anybody else and\n\n220\n00:11:04.265 --> 00:11:06.720\nthe rest of the band to actually\nknow what's going on here.\n\n221\n00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.435\nCuz don't want to let the cat out of\nthe bag before we actually go on tour.\n\n222\n00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:10.760\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Is there a way that we can do that by\n\n223\n00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.090\nkeeping that out of\nthe view of other people?\n\n224\n00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:17.307\n&gt;&gt; That's a perfect segway\ninto Private because.\n\n225\n00:11:17.307 --> 00:11:19.800\nYes, it's got the little lock on there.\n\n226\n00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.747\nAnd notice it says,\nmark this item as private, so\n\n227\n00:11:22.747 --> 00:11:25.566\nthat other people cannot\nsee the details of it.\n\n228\n00:11:25.566 --> 00:11:32.920\nSo they'll see that there is blocked time\nfrom 11:15 am to 1:15 pm, on June 7th.\n\n229\n00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.330\nThey'll see it, but\nthey don't see anything else.\n\n230\n00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.250\nAnd so, they don't even see the subject.\n\n231\n00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.070\nThey don't see the location.\n\n232\n00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:43.340\nThey just know that something's on\nyour calendar, but they can't see it.\n\n233\n00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:48.010\nSo that is actually very important\nbecause of how much exposure, we'll say,\n\n234\n00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.100\nthat you can give with your calendars.\n\n235\n00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.026\nAnd you wanna make sure nobody sees it.\n\n236\n00:11:52.026 --> 00:11:56.170\nNow, depending on our permissions\nthat we give to certain people.\n\n237\n00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:00.590\nAnd we'll talk about that in our share and\ntransfer calendars episode.\n\n238\n00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.000\nSo check back on that.\n\n239\n00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.524\nIs that maybe you do have an assistant\nthat you trust with your private\n\n240\n00:12:05.524 --> 00:12:08.396\nappointments, and\nthey're managing your calendar.\n\n241\n00:12:08.396 --> 00:12:13.540\nYes, you can see details of\na private message, or not see that.\n\n242\n00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.830\nSo that's a great point there to make sure\nthat we keep it out of the view of others,\n\n243\n00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.240\nbecause yes, it is very important.\n\n244\n00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.860\nWe're doing our rainbow sparkles.\n\n245\n00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.155\nIf you've been following along\nwith the series, we did a vote and\n\n246\n00:12:23.155 --> 00:12:26.240\nrainbow sparkles is what we're going to be\n&gt;&gt; I'll just remember that, yep [LAUGH].\n\n247\n00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.891\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And then of course,\nyou have your high and\n\n248\n00:12:28.891 --> 00:12:30.894\nlow importants that you could set.\n\n249\n00:12:30.894 --> 00:12:32.424\nThe same way that you do with your Emails,\n\n250\n00:12:32.424 --> 00:12:35.114\nnow if you put everything as high\nimportance now as we talked about this.\n\n251\n00:12:35.114 --> 00:12:39.493\nMake sure you use it sparingly and\nefficiently to where it actually means\n\n252\n00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:42.600\nsomething, and\nwe don't have the whole cry wolf.\n\n253\n00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.640\n&gt;&gt; That goes back to that\nsaying that we say in security,\n\n254\n00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.450\nif everything's critical\nnothing's critical at all.\n\n255\n00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:48.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH], exactly.\n\n256\n00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.876\nIt's like, this is so\nimportant that we talk about the tour bus.\n\n257\n00:12:51.876 --> 00:12:54.820\nI mean rainbow sparkles\nis important to me,\n\n258\n00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.080\nbut it might not be important to others.\n\n259\n00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.022\nYes, exactly.\n\n260\n00:12:58.022 --> 00:13:04.062\nSo one thing I wanted to point out is\nthey do not have a phone number field.\n\n261\n00:13:04.062 --> 00:13:06.948\nWhich is something that I've\nnoticed through out like,\n\n262\n00:13:06.948 --> 00:13:08.820\ncuz when I'm scheduling meetings.\n\n263\n00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.430\nCuz I would always have to go ahead and\nmanage some of the meetings for\n\n264\n00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.240\nthe Director that I used to work with for\nthe university.\n\n265\n00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.320\nAnd we're always on a phone meeting.\n\n266\n00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.990\nAnd I wish they would have a field like\na specific field that had a phone number.\n\n267\n00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:21.940\nCuz they have a location, a start time.\n\n268\n00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.296\nSo, if you have a phone number,\n\n269\n00:13:23.296 --> 00:13:26.377\nyou gotta show it in the meeting notes\nto make sure that you've got that.\n\n270\n00:13:26.377 --> 00:13:29.612\nAll right, so I think we've\ngone through all the different\n\n271\n00:13:29.612 --> 00:13:32.450\npieces that are in the new\nappointment Window.\n\n272\n00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:36.380\nAnd so now my last thing to do is\nto go ahead and Save and Close, and\n\n273\n00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.570\nit puts it on my calendar.\n\n274\n00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:42.130\nYou can see that that little purple strip\ndown the side, when we hover to discover,\n\n275\n00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.900\nwe go ahead and get our little details.\n\n276\n00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.020\nWe know it's private,\nbecause of the little lock down there.\n\n277\n00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:51.620\nAnd now it is on my calendar,\nand there we go.\n\n278\n00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.800\nLet's say that JC calls me, or\ntexts me, and everything and says,\n\n279\n00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.270\nhey you know what I can't meet on\nWednesday, but I can meet on Tuesday.\n\n280\n00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.470\nCan we move our lunch meeting to Tuesday?\n\n281\n00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.060\nSame time and everything,\nI just need a different date.\n\n282\n00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.830\nSure.\nSo there's always gonna be times where\n\n283\n00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.570\nyou're going to need to edit\nyour different appointments.\n\n284\n00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:09.610\nTwo ways we could do it.\n\n285\n00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:10.583\nWe can double-click.\n\n286\n00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:12.635\nWhen we double-click on the appointment,\n\n287\n00:14:12.635 --> 00:14:15.580\nit's going to open up that\nappointment in the same dialog box.\n\n288\n00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:20.260\nAnd I can go ahead and make my changes\nto go ahead and move it over to the 6th.\n\n289\n00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.650\nOr maybe I needed to change the time, or\nmaybe I need to add some different notes.\n\n290\n00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:26.176\nSo I could go ahead and\ndo anything that I need here.\n\n291\n00:14:26.176 --> 00:14:30.047\nAny changes that you make, you Save and\nyou Close, and you do that.\n\n292\n00:14:30.047 --> 00:14:34.040\nBut if you're just moving dates,\nyou don't have to change anything else.\n\n293\n00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:38.030\nI do like the drag and\ndrop method of taking it from\n\n294\n00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:42.310\nhere in my Month view,\ngrab it, and drag it.\n\n295\n00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:44.360\nMove it over to the six, let go.\n\n296\n00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.490\nAnd I've just changed that appointment.\n\n297\n00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:51.329\nAnd so you can edit by dragging across the\ncalendar, if you need to change the date,\n\n298\n00:14:51.329 --> 00:14:53.071\nand no other of the specific.\n\n299\n00:14:53.071 --> 00:14:54.600\nSo, I like that.\n\n300\n00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.550\nNow what if I needed to create\na reoccurring appointment,\n\n301\n00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:05.190\nsomething that I need to do like we said\nevery other week, or every two days.\n\n302\n00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:08.250\nWell I'm not sure if every two days would\nkinda work out with a five day work week.\n\n303\n00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.010\nBut hey, maybe we work six days a week,\nwho knows?\n\n304\n00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.050\nSo that could well work.\n\n305\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.403\nWhatever type of occurrence you\nneed to set, you can do that.\n\n306\n00:15:15.403 --> 00:15:17.834\nSo let's pick, let's pick.\n\n307\n00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:22.225\nLet's say that, I'm gonna be meeting with\n\n308\n00:15:22.225 --> 00:15:27.566\nthe Director of\nThe Rainbow Sparkles paint company,\n\n309\n00:15:27.566 --> 00:15:33.110\nevery Monday at 9:00 a.m for\nthe next two months.\n\n310\n00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.088\nI'm totally making this up.\n\n311\n00:15:35.088 --> 00:15:37.940\n[LAUGH] So,\nI need to put it on the calendar.\n\n312\n00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.066\nSo I need to make sure\nthat my 9 am on Monday,\n\n313\n00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:45.379\nevery other Monday is going to be set for\nthe next two months.\n\n314\n00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:49.938\nCuz right now, at the time of filming\nit is May 30th, starting June 1st.\n\n315\n00:15:49.938 --> 00:15:55.176\nThat would be, well the beginning of June\n[LAUGH] all the way to the end of July,\n\n316\n00:15:55.176 --> 00:15:58.253\nevery other Monday starting with June 5th.\n\n317\n00:15:58.253 --> 00:15:59.286\nSo I picked this.\n\n318\n00:15:59.286 --> 00:16:00.119\nI always do that.\n\n319\n00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:02.920\nI'm going to double click on this\ncuz I like the double click.\n\n320\n00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.560\nNow, the double click method\ndoes automatically put this\n\n321\n00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.110\ninto an all day event.\n\n322\n00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:11.270\nSo when I had right clicked on it before,\nit gave me those times.\n\n323\n00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.610\nI just uncheck it and\nthen I can go ahead and set my timing.\n\n324\n00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:16.500\nThat's just kind of the way\nthat I've always gotten used to\n\n325\n00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.550\nadding appointments to my calendar.\n\n326\n00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:24.416\nSo I said 9 AM, we'll meet from 9 to we'll\njust do a 30 minute meeting, that's fine.\n\n327\n00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:29.563\nand we'll say meet with bus painter and\nthe location would be in the,\n\n328\n00:16:29.563 --> 00:16:33.640\nlet's say the garage,\nthe garage, there we go.\n\n329\n00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.959\nAnd we've got that, I can add my notes.\n\n330\n00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:42.030\nBut this is going to be every Monday for\nthe next two months.\n\n331\n00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:45.260\nReoccurrence, over here,\nI can click on this.\n\n332\n00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.820\nAnd now it gives me what my\npattern it needs to be and\n\n333\n00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.090\nhow I could designate this.\n\n334\n00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.810\nIs this a daily occurence?\n\n335\n00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.330\nMaybe this is something I\nhave to do every single day.\n\n336\n00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.840\nOr like when I said every other day,\nlike every two days.\n\n337\n00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.810\nNotice if I choose daily,\nevery two days, every four days,\n\n338\n00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.510\nhowever many days it's going to do.\n\n339\n00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:10.500\nIf I do weekly, okay, reoccurs every\nhow many weeks on this particular day.\n\n340\n00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.290\nIt's checked off on Monday.\n\n341\n00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.380\nMaybe I had to meet with him Monday and\nWednesdays.\n\n342\n00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.830\nSo I could go ahead and set this here.\n\n343\n00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:20.740\nI'd open up Monday's appointment and\nset the reoccurrence in here.\n\n344\n00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.810\nThe range of the reoccurrence,\nno end date in sight.\n\n345\n00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.690\nWe're gonna be meeting forever,\nor after however many occurences.\n\n346\n00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.310\nThis could be, hey, we're gonna meet\nsix times between now and December.\n\n347\n00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.020\nAnd it's gonna be every month.\n\n348\n00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:40.950\nSo you could go ahead and set after six\noccurences and it could be every month.\n\n349\n00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.880\nOr you have a specific end date.\n\n350\n00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.645\nAnd I'm going to choose that one\nbecause I just know that it's\n\n351\n00:17:45.645 --> 00:17:47.360\ngonna be until the end of July.\n\n352\n00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.090\nI don't know how many Mondays\nthat's going to be, so\n\n353\n00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:52.980\nI don't know how many\noccurrences it's gonna be.\n\n354\n00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.250\nI just know that there's a specific date.\n\n355\n00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:59.080\nAnd if the Monday like the every other\nMonday is that last week in July.\n\n356\n00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.460\nOkay then that's fine.\n\n357\n00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.254\nSo it will go ahead and schedule\naccordingly based on the patterns that\n\n358\n00:18:05.254 --> 00:18:08.739\nyou're setting and the specific\ndate that you want it to end by.\n\n359\n00:18:08.739 --> 00:18:12.930\nSo let's go ahead and choose July 31st.\n\n360\n00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:16.950\nWe're doing every two weeks on a Monday,\n\n361\n00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.570\nit's starting on the 5th cuz\nthat's the first Monday of June.\n\n362\n00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:23.990\nWe have our time set,\nlooks good, we click OK.\n\n363\n00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.580\nAnd now you can see at this little note,\n\n364\n00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.000\noccurs every two weeks on\nMonday until this date.\n\n365\n00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.010\nIt puts the reoccurrence\ndown at the bottom.\n\n366\n00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:33.720\nAnd I'm good.\n\n367\n00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.620\nI will keep this as busy, keep it as\n15 minutes, keep all the default parts.\n\n368\n00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:42.350\nAnd I think I've got everything set,\nand I'll click Save and Close.\n\n369\n00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:48.890\nPuts it on, notice if I scroll down,\nthere's my 9:00 AM, every other week.\n\n370\n00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:52.590\nAnd all the way down to, yep,\nAugust, it's off my Calendar.\n\n371\n00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.650\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vaughan, let's say that we met\na couple of times with the Rainbow Sparkle\n\n372\n00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:56.480\npaint company and\n\n373\n00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.395\nall of a sudden we have to make a decision\nbetween pink flamingo and salmon.\n\n374\n00:19:00.395 --> 00:19:01.961\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And the fact that I know those\n\n375\n00:19:01.961 --> 00:19:05.365\ncolors probably is saying something but\nwe can't make up our mind, and\n\n376\n00:19:05.365 --> 00:19:08.731\nwe need to have some other people\ncome on board with this appointment.\n\n377\n00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:11.885\nIs there a way that we can tie in other\npeople to an appointment if we can't\n\n378\n00:19:11.885 --> 00:19:13.575\nchoose the right color?\n\n379\n00:19:13.575 --> 00:19:15.075\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n380\n00:19:15.075 --> 00:19:16.135\nYes, we can.\n\n381\n00:19:16.135 --> 00:19:18.815\nNow there's a couple\nways that we can do this.\n\n382\n00:19:18.815 --> 00:19:23.355\nWe can invite in,\nhere let me open it up for you.\n\n383\n00:19:23.355 --> 00:19:25.775\n[LAUGH] So then I can read it off.\n\n384\n00:19:25.775 --> 00:19:27.155\nAnd this is actually,\n\n385\n00:19:27.155 --> 00:19:29.890\nthere's a couple things that\nwe're going to cover right here.\n\n386\n00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:33.910\nBecause this is a reoccurring appointment,\nright now.\n\n387\n00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.420\nSo, when I'm double-clicking on this one,\non June 5th.\n\n388\n00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:40.630\nIt is asking me, hey, so do you wanna open\n\n389\n00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:45.440\njust this specific occurrence,\nor the entire series?\n\n390\n00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.990\nAnd this is, where like you're asking,\nhey, if I wanted to add in,\n\n391\n00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:54.020\nI really need Lance's help on this, I'm\nwanna go ahead and bring him in on this?\n\n392\n00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.000\nAnd I want him the whole series, that's\nwhere I could go ahead and determine.\n\n393\n00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.300\nWe'll go ahead and\ndo another situation where hey,\n\n394\n00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:04.970\nmaybe the bus driver calls and\nsays hey that first week in July.\n\n395\n00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:08.130\nI can't meet on Monday but I can meet\non Wednesday for you but, just for\n\n396\n00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.380\nthat one week.\n\n397\n00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:13.056\nThat would be an instance that we\nwould say hey, just go ahead and\n\n398\n00:20:13.056 --> 00:20:17.687\nopen up this one particular event or\nthis one occurrence, not the whole series,\n\n399\n00:20:17.687 --> 00:20:21.296\nlet's move that first week in\nJuly's meeting to Wednesday but\n\n400\n00:20:21.296 --> 00:20:24.380\nthen after that we keep on\nour regular occurrence.\n\n401\n00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.060\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat attribute doesn't propagate itself\n\n402\n00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.730\nto the rest of the series as well, right?\n\n403\n00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:32.800\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, if we choose just\nthis one when editing this\n\n404\n00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.600\nparticular appointment because it says\nright here is it part of a series.\n\n405\n00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.940\nSo what do you want to do?\n\n406\n00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:43.870\nThe entire series or\njust that one particular event?\n\n407\n00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:45.710\nI had to choose my, I almost said meeting.\n\n408\n00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:46.990\nI'm like, wait, it's not a meeting.\n\n409\n00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:50.340\nGotta use that vocabulary correctly\nbecause we kind of interchange it all and\n\n410\n00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.950\nit all gets blended together.\n\n411\n00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.190\nSo let's go with the whole series.\n\n412\n00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.883\nWe click OK.\n\n413\n00:20:55.883 --> 00:21:02.230\nAnd yes, I can go ahead and\ninvite attendees.\n\n414\n00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.192\nI keep my switching the i's and\nthe a's around in there.\n\n415\n00:21:05.192 --> 00:21:07.344\n[LAUGH] But\nthere's a lot of e's in there too.\n\n416\n00:21:07.344 --> 00:21:09.390\nSo, [LAUGH] lots of those.\n\n417\n00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:13.910\nIf I invite Attendees,\nthen it becomes a meeting.\n\n418\n00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:18.000\nWhich is fine, there's nothing wrong with\nthat, it's just going to once you rope him\n\n419\n00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.860\nin, then it's going to do the whole\nemailing him, putting on his calendar,\n\n420\n00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.460\nletting him accept it.\n\n421\n00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.970\nGreat way to go ahead and\nbring that person in.\n\n422\n00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.740\nOr if you didn't wanna necessarily\nbring him in as a meeting but\n\n423\n00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:35.090\nyou wanna let Lance know,\nhey, this is my appointment.\n\n424\n00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:40.780\nAnd I wanna give it to you as your\nown appointment, not as a meeting.\n\n425\n00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.170\nYou can do what's known as forwarding,\n\n426\n00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:47.570\nand when you forward this particular\nmessage, or this appointment sorry.\n\n427\n00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:52.760\nIt's sending it as an item, just like\nwhen we were doing sharing of contacts.\n\n428\n00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.410\nI want to forward a contact\nto one of my friends, and\n\n429\n00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:02.190\nit brings it up as either a A VCF or\nan Outlook item.\n\n430\n00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:05.040\nSo either one because\nwe're all using Outlook.\n\n431\n00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.130\nSo I could go ahead and do this.\n\n432\n00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:10.220\nAnd notice that the different options\nhere is forward and forward is iCalendar.\n\n433\n00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.500\nThis would be if I was\nforwarding it as an iCalendar,\n\n434\n00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:16.058\nthat might be one that where\nsomebody is not using Outlook.\n\n435\n00:22:16.058 --> 00:22:19.840\nSo I wanna go ahead and give it to them\nin a particular format like a generic\n\n436\n00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.600\nformat that all calendars and\nmail programs go ahead and talk in.\n\n437\n00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.310\nLike if I was doing a Yahoo or\nGoogle for somebody.\n\n438\n00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:31.930\nBut since we're sending it to Lance\nas a forward, as an appointment,\n\n439\n00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:36.640\nI'll just go ahead and use the forward\noption here and then click this.\n\n440\n00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.520\nNotice that it does choose\nas an Outlook item.\n\n441\n00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:45.440\nAnd then I could go ahead and bring this\nover to Lance and for this meeting, I can\n\n442\n00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:52.660\ngive him a little note for you to put on\nyour calendar to know about painting.\n\n443\n00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.770\nI actually typed that all right.\n\n444\n00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:56.640\nAmazing.\n\n445\n00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:02.000\nAnd then I can send that on to him,\nand yes I am sending it from Joey.\n\n446\n00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.370\nAlways double checking.\n\n447\n00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:07.512\nI've just got in a habit before you\nclick that send button, double check,\n\n448\n00:23:07.512 --> 00:23:09.561\nyes that is to who I want it to, good.\n\n449\n00:23:09.561 --> 00:23:11.540\nCuz you don't wanna send\nemails to the wrong person.\n\n450\n00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.352\nCuz you do it once you're like ooh,\nall right, [LAUGH].\n\n451\n00:23:15.352 --> 00:23:17.830\nSo I always double check\nmyself before moving on.\n\n452\n00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.350\nAnd then we'll go ahead and jump over\nto Lance and see what he sees, and\n\n453\n00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.010\nthen we can go ahead and\nmove it onto his appointment.\n\n454\n00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.850\nSo make sure I go ahead and\ndo that there, Wes.\n\n455\n00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:28.390\n&gt;&gt; Will do.\n\n456\n00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.390\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, so, but back to the,\n\n457\n00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:35.039\nbecause we got a couple little trees going\noff on here, I wanna get back to that hey.\n\n458\n00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.600\nThe first week in July, I need to move\nthat appointment for just that one.\n\n459\n00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.770\nOkay, so I am in June, there is July.\n\n460\n00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.130\nOkay, there's July 3rd, so\n\n461\n00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:48.046\nthat looks like that is the first one,\nbecause it's 4th July.\n\n462\n00:23:48.046 --> 00:23:49.102\nPlan that.\n\n463\n00:23:49.102 --> 00:23:53.746\n[LAUGH] So\nhe needs to meet with us on Wednesday.\n\n464\n00:23:53.746 --> 00:23:56.201\nNow I can already tell that\nWednesday's not gonna work for me,\n\n465\n00:23:56.201 --> 00:23:59.462\nbecause I'm looking at my Calendar and\nit looks like I have a Director's meeting.\n\n466\n00:23:59.462 --> 00:24:02.304\nSo, maybe I've talked to him and\nsaid Hey, well all go ahead.\n\n467\n00:24:02.304 --> 00:24:06.371\nHow about we meet on the 7th?\n\n468\n00:24:06.371 --> 00:24:07.990\nWe'll meet on that Friday.\n\n469\n00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:11.330\nBecause I have to make sure I'm looking at\nmy calendar that it doesn't work for me.\n\n470\n00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.560\nNow this is all we're talking\nover the phone, by the way.\n\n471\n00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:18.360\nAnd when we start getting to meetings,\nthis can all be done by Email.\n\n472\n00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.369\nSo, you can see why there might be\nreasons why you want to do meetings.\n\n473\n00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:28.110\nWe'll go ahead and open this one instance\nof this re-occurring appointment.\n\n474\n00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:34.940\nGoing to move this over to the start date\nis going to be the 7th, so that's Friday.\n\n475\n00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.830\nGo ahead and click Save.\n\n476\n00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.700\nNow, you change the date\nof these occurrence, so\n\n477\n00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.380\nwe get to change all\nthe dates of [INAUDIBLE].\n\n478\n00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.211\nIt is also reminding me right now, hey,\nare you sure you know where you are at?\n\n479\n00:24:45.211 --> 00:24:48.865\nOkay, yes I'm glad that you're giving\nme a little prompt to say like hey,\n\n480\n00:24:48.865 --> 00:24:51.486\nif you like the whole series\nto move to every Fridays.\n\n481\n00:24:51.486 --> 00:24:54.150\nNow, just this one, so I click Yes.\n\n482\n00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:57.910\nAnd then that moves on over, but\nyou can see the regular re-occurrence and\n\n483\n00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:00.530\nthe pattern stays in tact.\n\n484\n00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.850\nSo that's why you can go ahead and\nmove that.\n\n485\n00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:07.150\nLet's jump over to Lance right now.\n\n486\n00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.170\nAnd let's go ahead and\nstart up his machine.\n\n487\n00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.070\nI thought I had it on, but\nI guess it, he went to sleep.\n\n488\n00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:13.155\nHe's a little tired.\n\n489\n00:25:13.155 --> 00:25:16.080\n[LAUGH] Let's go ahead and sign him in.\n\n490\n00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:21.110\nIt'll bring up Lance,\nnotice I am in Lance inbox right here.\n\n491\n00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:26.120\nI have that Joey has forwarded\nme a meeting with a bus painter.\n\n492\n00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.850\nI can open it.\n\n493\n00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:32.886\nAnd once I open it, it opens right\nhere into an appointment series.\n\n494\n00:25:32.886 --> 00:25:36.770\nAnd so, it's giving me the option for\nme, look at right at the top.\n\n495\n00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:42.623\nTo copy to my calendar,\nnot as an attendee of a meeting,\n\n496\n00:25:42.623 --> 00:25:46.368\nas my calendar for my appointment.\n\n497\n00:25:46.368 --> 00:25:48.102\nI say OK here.\n\n498\n00:25:48.102 --> 00:25:51.140\nI come over to my calendar.\n\n499\n00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:56.520\nAnd notice that now that same appointment\nthat was on Joey's calendar has\n\n500\n00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.970\nnow been copied over to Lance's calendar.\n\n501\n00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.994\nAnd so everybody knows, and\nit's pretty easy to do.\n\n502\n00:26:01.994 --> 00:26:06.671\nSo I think that's pretty much everything\nI have to cover about appointments.\n\n503\n00:26:06.671 --> 00:26:09.290\nThey're for you,\nyou set up the re-occurrences.\n\n504\n00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:10.850\nYou can categorize them.\n\n505\n00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:13.380\nMake them all pretty, and then,\ngo ahead and, you know what?\n\n506\n00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.401\nGet your life in order.\n\n507\n00:26:14.401 --> 00:26:16.310\nSo [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A lot of great information there,\n\n508\n00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.050\nVonne about making appointments.\n\n509\n00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.880\nNow, it does look like one thing\nthat we're running short on is,\n\n510\n00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.140\nwell, time in this episode.\n\n511\n00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:25.340\nBut, before we do, do you have any final\nwords that you might want to impart to\n\n512\n00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:28.290\nour viewers about managing\nappointments inside of Outlook?\n\n513\n00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:32.400\nI would say just make sure to organize\nthem however, it makes sense for you.\n\n514\n00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.940\nYou know, your mess is your mess,\nas I always say.\n\n515\n00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.930\nMe and my mom would always say, how could\nyou find anything in that room of yours?\n\n516\n00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:42.585\nI know which piles are the kind of clean,\nand then half clean.\n\n517\n00:26:42.585 --> 00:26:44.374\nWe all have our own organization.\n\n518\n00:26:44.374 --> 00:26:48.815\nSo, use those categories,\ngo ahead and make your notes.\n\n519\n00:26:48.815 --> 00:26:52.495\nThe notes are really important,\nand just try to keep yourself as\n\n520\n00:26:52.495 --> 00:26:55.705\norganized as possible, because that's\nwhat we're all trying to do, so.\n\n521\n00:26:55.705 --> 00:26:56.565\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne.\n\n522\n00:26:56.565 --> 00:27:00.115\nAs always, we appreciate having you in\nthe studios with us at OfficeProTV, and\n\n523\n00:27:00.115 --> 00:27:01.835\nwe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n524\n00:27:01.835 --> 00:27:03.595\nSigning out I've been your host,\nWes Brian.\n\n525\n00:27:03.595 --> 00:27:04.495\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n526\n00:27:04.495 --> 00:27:06.472\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n527\n00:27:06.472 --> 00:27:11.482\n[SOUND]\n\n",

so\nif you're watching in succession you\n\n11\n00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.640\nheard me talk about meetings in our\nappointments and now we are at meetings so\n\n12\n00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.730\nwe're gonna talk about meetings.\n\n13\n00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.170\nWow, how many times can I say\nmeetings in a small little time?\n\n14\n00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.647\n&gt;&gt; So what you're saying, Vonne,\n\n15\n00:00:35.647 --> 00:00:38.672\nis in this episode we're gonna be\ntalking about meetings, right?\n\n16\n00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:40.909\nAll right, so when it comes to meetings,\nwhere do we start?\n\n17\n00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:43.810\n&gt;&gt; You know sometimes you have to\nhave a meeting to have a meeting.\n\n18\n00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.795\nYou know what I'm talking about.\n\n19\n00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:51.820\n[LAUGH] So we're gonna talk about actually\ninviting attendees into our meeting and\n\n20\n00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.350\nhow it all works with multiple calendars,\nputs it all in there, proposing new times.\n\n21\n00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.700\nSo, we're going to be, we're gonna\nhave another round of who are we and\n\n22\n00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.370\na sense of that I'm going to be Joey\nas the organizer of the meeting.\n\n23\n00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.490\nI'm going to be the one that creates it,\nand I'm going to invite Joey.\n\n24\n00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.390\nNo, wait.\n\n25\n00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.600\nSee, I already messed up.\n\n26\n00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.300\nI'm going to invite Justin and\nI'm going to invite Lance.\n\n27\n00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.200\nSince I have access to all\nof these different machines,\n\n28\n00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.010\nwe're gonna be switching back and\nforthto say okay, now let's go ahead and\n\n29\n00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.920\nnow I'm Justin, now let's go back,\nnow I'm Joey [LAUGH] and now I'm Lance.\n\n30\n00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.690\nSo we'll go ahead and keep that in check.\n\n31\n00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.080\nAnd I have color coded all\nof our calendars to try and\n\n32\n00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.230\nkeep it along the way.\n\n33\n00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.030\nSo if we're ready to go ahead and\n\n34\n00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.962\nget on this journey of being all of\nthese people let's jump right in.\n\n35\n00:01:41.962 --> 00:01:44.820\n[LAUGH] So I have Joey's calendar up.\n\n36\n00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.000\nWe had made some meetings about the tour\nbus painting in our previous episode,\n\n37\n00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.700\nso now I want to make a meeting with\nthose two other individuals that I said\n\n38\n00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.824\nto talk about the upcoming tour.\n\n39\n00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.060\nWhich I would love to have happen, but the\ntour that's going to be coming up because\n\n40\n00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.630\nthere's a little rumble, so\nthey want to go ahead and meet about this.\n\n41\n00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.743\nSo, as Joey, I'm determining what\ntime do I want to meet with them.\n\n42\n00:02:12.743 --> 00:02:18.023\nAnd I'm going to pick May, no,\nJune 6th on this particular date.\n\n43\n00:02:18.023 --> 00:02:22.305\nThere is a specific reason why I'm\nchoosing this because I wanna tell you\n\n44\n00:02:22.305 --> 00:02:24.350\nabout the scheduling assistant.\n\n45\n00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.430\nHow do I make a new meeting?\n\n46\n00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.050\nThe same way that I made an appointment.\n\n47\n00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.220\nI can double click, I can right click.\n\n48\n00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.320\nI can come up onto the home\ntab of the ribbon.\n\n49\n00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.350\nWhy don't we go with that one.\n\n50\n00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.500\nWe'll say a New Meeting.\n\n51\n00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.880\nNow when I go ahead and\nuse this particular button,\n\n52\n00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.080\nit automatically adds a To field.\n\n53\n00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.140\nAnd that's really the only difference\nbetween creating an appointment and\n\n54\n00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.440\ncreating a meeting is that it adds\nthat field for you to go ahead and\n\n55\n00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.540\ninvite people.\n\n56\n00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.470\nSo if you've seen the episode\nabout the appointments,\n\n57\n00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.038\nthen pretty much all the fields\nare the exact same besides just that one.\n\n58\n00:02:54.038 --> 00:02:58.560\nExcept for one other button.\n\n59\n00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.700\nSo I have To, who do I want to\nhave people come in to this?\n\n60\n00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.050\nI want this to be Justin and since he's\nin my remembrance, if you wanna say,\n\n61\n00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.160\nthe autocomplete and he's in my global\naddress list if I wanted to ever go there.\n\n62\n00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.710\nJustin and Lance and you know, what\nwe're gonna throw in Chris in there too.\n\n63\n00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.490\nAnd I wanted to throw him in here,\nbecause he is not on Outlook.\n\n64\n00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.690\nHe uses Gmail, so that's the one I have.\n\n65\n00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.660\nNow, is that going to make\na difference when I start setting\n\n66\n00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.920\nup these meetings with people?\n\n67\n00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.950\nThey actually work really well together.\n\n68\n00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.280\nSo I actually created a meeting a while\nago, and had Chris respond so you can\n\n69\n00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.840\nsee that he can respond the same way\nthat Lance and JT are going to respond.\n\n70\n00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.690\nAnd it'll still add on his calendar, and\n\n71\n00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.530\neverything to that effect is just\ngoing to be that it works with Gmail.\n\n72\n00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.290\nSo almost all of the features\nthat you can do with meetings,\n\n73\n00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.750\nthey don't all have to be on Outlook.\n\n74\n00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.910\nNow the different ways that I'm gonna show\nyou are going to be within Outlook, but\n\n75\n00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.850\nI just wanted to go ahead and\nthrow him into the mix.\n\n76\n00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.160\nSo the subject is Tour?\n\n77\n00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.790\nThe location, location is where\nI can go ahead and set this.\n\n78\n00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.480\nNow this is something that I didn't\nactually address in the appointments,\n\n79\n00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.570\nbecause well, I just wanted to wait for\nthe meetings.\n\n80\n00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.080\nSo over here on the right-hand\nside there is a Rooms button.\n\n81\n00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.580\nAnd this Rooms button would be if\nyour organization has went ahead and\n\n82\n00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.600\ndesignated rooms or\ndifferent resources within your\n\n83\n00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.220\nglobal address book, then you might\nbe able to go ahead and have this.\n\n84\n00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.310\nNow this does have to be set up\nat that administrative level\n\n85\n00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.160\nto where they add this.\n\n86\n00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.120\nSee there's conference room A and\nsince Ronnie is the administrator of\n\n87\n00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.280\nall of the OfficePro demo co accounts,\nhe went ahead and set that.\n\n88\n00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.170\nSo if you don't have anything in your\nrooms, that's because well, your IT or\n\n89\n00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.300\nadministrator didn't set that up.\n\n90\n00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.210\nSo it's not horrible\nif it doesn't show up.\n\n91\n00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.520\nBut I wanted to throw that out to you,\n\n92\n00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.730\nbecause a lot of organizations\nwill go ahead and use that.\n\n93\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.610\nBecause if you have a large organization\nwith many different types of meeting rooms\n\n94\n00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.590\nand conference rooms, you wanna make\nsure you're reserving that and so\n\n95\n00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.930\neverybody sees that you are using\nthat particular resource.\n\n96\n00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.390\nSo I wanted to throw that out to you,\nand the drop down right here,\n\n97\n00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.040\nthese are all the ones that I have\nbeen using throughout Joey's calendar.\n\n98\n00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.020\nSo you can see there's Pizano's Pizza,\nthere's Studio, there's Joey's office,\n\n99\n00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.420\nthere's the garage that we were\ntalking about with the tour bus.\n\n100\n00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:41.400\nSo that drop down will come to the ones\nyou have used the most frequently\n\n101\n00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.410\nor in the last,\nhowever recent you've done it.\n\n102\n00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.610\nWe're going to say Joey's office,\n\n103\n00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.975\nwhich I think was already in there but\nwe're going to type it again.\n\n104\n00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:53.311\nJoey's office.\n\n105\n00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:57.420\n[LAUGH]\nWow, okay.\n\n106\n00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.305\nPretend you didn't see that.\n\n107\n00:05:59.305 --> 00:06:01.810\n[LAUGH] So I have this,\nthis is the time I want them to meet.\n\n108\n00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:02.980\nWhat do I want them to meet?\n\n109\n00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.390\nI want to meet.\n\n110\n00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.360\nMaybe I wanna meet in the afternoon.\n\n111\n00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.970\nBut the thing is,\nI don't know if Justin, Lance,\n\n112\n00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.160\nand Chris are going to be able\nto meet at that particular time.\n\n113\n00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.130\nRemember, I prefaced and\nsaid I picked this date for a reason?\n\n114\n00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.890\nI wanna show you the scheduling assistant.\n\n115\n00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.070\nUp at the top, on the meeting tab in\nour ribbon, there is appointment,\n\n116\n00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.770\nand there is scheduling assistant.\n\n117\n00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.780\nThink of like it an assistant\nthat helps you with scheduling.\n\n118\n00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.970\nWow, that's pretty good on their naming.\n\n119\n00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.890\nSo, this brings up the calendars for\n\n120\n00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.660\nall the different people that\nare in your organization.\n\n121\n00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.770\nNow notice that the Chris part in here,\n\n122\n00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.690\nremember I said most everything\nis going to be available for\n\n123\n00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.440\nyou when people are not within your same\norganization or your same Exchange server.\n\n124\n00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.250\nChris is not on here,\n\n125\n00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.510\nso I'm not gonna be able to see his\ncalendar in a scheduling assistant.\n\n126\n00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:57.300\nBut Joey, no wait, Justin and Lance and,\nwell, I'm Joey too, it's gonna show me\n\n127\n00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.600\neverybody's schedules that are already on\nit because we're all on the same network.\n\n128\n00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.860\nSo I'm just gonna scroll\nover a little bit.\n\n129\n00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.580\nI have to find the time and the reason why\nit's not being set right now is because,\n\n130\n00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.120\nlet me go ahead and get back to the\nappointment, I didn't set the date yet.\n\n131\n00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.990\nSo if I go back to the appointment,\nyou know, I set the date and\n\n132\n00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.480\nit's not the right one.\n\n133\n00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.190\nThat's okay.\n\n134\n00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.660\nBut do notice right here that I changed\nthe buttons because once you get into\n\n135\n00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.180\nthe scheduling system,\n\n136\n00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.100\nI want to hit, there should be\na back button or something.\n\n137\n00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.610\nIt's not Delete,\nI don't want to delete it.\n\n138\n00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:30.770\nHow can I get back to where I was?\n\n139\n00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.350\nIt's Appointment.\n\n140\n00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.570\nSo there's two different views in here\nif you wanna get back to where it\n\n141\n00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:35.330\nnormally looks.\n\n142\n00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.150\nIt's kinda strange, cuz I'm like wait,\nI thought we're doing a meeting but\n\n143\n00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.830\nwe're in an appointment, okay.\n\n144\n00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.420\nHey, whatever.\n\n145\n00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.145\nThe button is that gets me to where\nI need to go, we can push it.\n\n146\n00:07:43.145 --> 00:07:48.567\nSo I come back to here, and I wasn't being\nable to see the scheduling assistant for\n\n147\n00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:52.572\nJuly 6th because I went to that ribbon,\nthat's what I did,\n\n148\n00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:55.737\nI went to the ribbon and\nchoose new New meeting?\n\n149\n00:07:55.737 --> 00:07:59.352\nAnd so, it wasn't associated\nwith any particular date or\n\n150\n00:07:59.352 --> 00:08:03.777\nit really was probably wherever I\nwas last clicked on, in my calendar,\n\n151\n00:08:03.777 --> 00:08:06.390\nwhen I clicked that new meeting button.\n\n152\n00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.210\nSorry, I just accidentally\nmaximized that Window for you.\n\n153\n00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:15.170\nSo, if I go ahead and\nset the date to July,\n\n154\n00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.092\nJune 6, whoo, I'm all over the place.\n\n155\n00:08:19.092 --> 00:08:21.920\n[LAUGH] June 6, here we go.\n\n156\n00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.790\nNow, we'll go into\nthe Scheduling Assistant.\n\n157\n00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:27.451\nSo now I'm a little closer to the date\nthat I want to get this appointment or\n\n158\n00:08:27.451 --> 00:08:28.760\nthis meeting scheduled.\n\n159\n00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.650\nNow scroll over a little bit,\nand I can see well cool.\n\n160\n00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:37.044\nAt least now, I can see that hey Justin is\ngoing to be out to lunch with Chris that\n\n161\n00:08:37.044 --> 00:08:39.321\nday until it looks like about 1:30.\n\n162\n00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:41.401\nLance, I don't see the details,\n\n163\n00:08:41.401 --> 00:08:46.320\nbut I see that he's got something\nscheduled on his calendar from 1 to 2:30.\n\n164\n00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.340\nOkay, perfect so that way I at least know\nright up top that I probably should have\n\n165\n00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.420\nscheduled the meeting during that times\nbecause I know that they're not gonna be\n\n166\n00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.143\nable to come.\n\n167\n00:08:55.143 --> 00:08:59.034\nSo I love the Scheduling Assistant if\nyou're all using the same exchange\n\n168\n00:08:59.034 --> 00:08:59.620\nservers.\n\n169\n00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:04.279\nSo definitely check that out so I can say\nI think 3 o'clock looks like it's open for\n\n170\n00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:07.387\neverybody, can't see Chris but\nwe'll just go ahead and\n\n171\n00:09:07.387 --> 00:09:09.675\nhopefully that 3 o'clock will be fine.\n\n172\n00:09:09.675 --> 00:09:12.590\nSo the scheduling system very handy.\n\n173\n00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.460\nLet's go back over to appointment.\n\n174\n00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.810\nNow we know that it's going to be 3 PM,\nthat we are going to set the time.\n\n175\n00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.570\nWe usually talk a lot, so\nwe'll go ahead and set that for an hour.\n\n176\n00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.710\nI could make notes.\n\n177\n00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.860\nBring tour notes.\n\n178\n00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.780\nWhat do I want to set\nthis as my importance?\n\n179\n00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.690\nWhether it's private, the categories,\nkeeping ourselves organized.\n\n180\n00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:42.530\nI'm gonna throw on a purple\ncategory onto this.\n\n181\n00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.935\nIt means something purpley.\n\n182\n00:09:44.935 --> 00:09:48.820\n[LAUGH] The reason why I'm setting this\nis just to make it a little easier for\n\n183\n00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.290\nus to find that on all of our calendars,\nsometimes we're gonna be jumping back and\n\n184\n00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.120\nforth from JT to Joey, to Lance.\n\n185\n00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.990\nSo I'll make a purple category and\n\n186\n00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.899\nit will retain with that when\nit goes onto their calendars.\n\n187\n00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.030\nAnd I think that's about\neverything I need to do.\n\n188\n00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:09.340\nThere is one thing, we're gonna see the\nresponses, or you are going to be seeing\n\n189\n00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:14.550\non the receiving end of getting\na meeting request from somebody.\n\n190\n00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:18.210\nOne of the things you're gonna\nbe able to do as an attendee,\n\n191\n00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.720\nyou're going to be able to either propose\na new time or be able to decline, so\n\n192\n00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:28.770\nresponse options, as the creator Joey\nis the organizer of this meeting.\n\n193\n00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.470\nHe can set whether or not you even\nallow them to propose a new time.\n\n194\n00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:36.080\nIt's like you know,\nno you can even do that.\n\n195\n00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.930\nRight now its checked on all of them like\nrequest responses I think that would be\n\n196\n00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.200\nnice like I would like them to either.\n\n197\n00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.190\nAccept or decline, so\nI might keep that one.\n\n198\n00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.300\nBut I don't want them\nto propose a new time.\n\n199\n00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.550\nSo if I click that notice\nthat it unchecks it.\n\n200\n00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.780\nNow that check box is off.\n\n201\n00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.300\nI'm gonna put it back on for\nthis instance.\n\n202\n00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.390\nSo we can see the variations\nof what happens.\n\n203\n00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.975\nBut that's something as a organizer,\nyou might want to set and\n\n204\n00:11:03.975 --> 00:11:07.775\nthen of course what the busy and\nthe reminders are for everything.\n\n205\n00:11:07.775 --> 00:11:11.260\nI'll keep everything the same and\nI think that looks good.\n\n206\n00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.040\nDouble checking everything,\ngot the right date, got the right time,\n\n207\n00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.830\ngot the right people.\n\n208\n00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.170\nYep, I'm gonna send this off.\n\n209\n00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.770\nAnd it sends off as the meeting\norganizer I've sent it out.\n\n210\n00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:29.270\nSo what happens on the receiving end,\nlet's go ahead and switch over to JT going\n\n211\n00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:35.380\nto come over to JT's email, tour?\n\n212\n00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.050\nSo anytime you as an organizer,\nas Joey sent it out, JT and\n\n213\n00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:46.390\nLance gets an email in their\ninbox to let them know that hey,\n\n214\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.790\nyou have been requested for a meeting.\n\n215\n00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:54.880\nI can see that the people who\nare required to attend are in here.\n\n216\n00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.700\nSo I can see that I, its not just me,\n\n217\n00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.770\nits also Lance and Chris are going\nto be invited to this meeting.\n\n218\n00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.920\nI can see that is has some notes,\nit has a date, it has a location.\n\n219\n00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.735\nSo now what do I want to do?\n\n220\n00:12:08.735 --> 00:12:13.204\nThat because my Windows is a little\nsmaller you might actually see\n\n221\n00:12:13.204 --> 00:12:17.114\nsome other buttons across\nthe top where it says respond.\n\n222\n00:12:17.114 --> 00:12:20.995\nSo this is also, I will say that\nthere are some new interfaces so\n\n223\n00:12:20.995 --> 00:12:24.728\nif you see like buttons that say,\nlike a big check or an X or a,\n\n224\n00:12:24.728 --> 00:12:29.520\nI think it's a yellow question mark,\nthey might go across the ribbon.\n\n225\n00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:34.890\nSo it could be that I'm pretty sure\nit's the resolution of my monitor,\n\n226\n00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:36.974\nbut I do know that they\nhave been changing.\n\n227\n00:12:36.974 --> 00:12:39.606\nIt's purple, sorry, it's a purple question\nmark it's not a yellow question mark.\n\n228\n00:12:39.606 --> 00:12:41.107\nI thought it was yellow?\n\n229\n00:12:41.107 --> 00:12:43.384\nOkay, so\nnow I can see what do I want to do?\n\n230\n00:12:43.384 --> 00:12:45.565\nDo I want to accept this?\n\n231\n00:12:45.565 --> 00:12:47.545\nDo I want to decline this?\n\n232\n00:12:47.545 --> 00:12:49.225\nDo I want to tell them tentative?\n\n233\n00:12:49.225 --> 00:12:50.254\nOr do I want to propose a new time?\n\n234\n00:12:50.254 --> 00:12:53.939\nBecause maybe its like hey it's not on\nmy schedule with the scheduling system,\n\n235\n00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:56.036\nbut I know I have to leave\nearly that day as JT.\n\n236\n00:12:56.036 --> 00:12:58.862\nSo maybe I'd say hey I'd love to meet but\ncan we move it up or\n\n237\n00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:00.319\ncan we move it to another day.\n\n238\n00:13:00.319 --> 00:13:03.090\nSo you can always choose\nthat type of options.\n\n239\n00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.660\n&gt;&gt; And Vonne would that be also\nsomething that might be handy too,\n\n240\n00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.850\nto give a responses to the proposal of\na new time because in this example,\n\n241\n00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.650\nChris you couldn't see what his\nactual times were blocked out.\n\n242\n00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:14.850\nWhat if he says well since\nyou can't see the time.\n\n243\n00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:15.744\nI'm actually meeting that time.\n\n244\n00:13:15.744 --> 00:13:16.684\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n245\n00:13:16.684 --> 00:13:20.390\n&gt;&gt; Since you don't have control over\nof that he able to respond back.\n\n246\n00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:24.660\n&gt;&gt; Exactly yes, so its a nice way to\ngive him that option, cause you really\n\n247\n00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:29.230\nwant to get this meeting on schedule but\nif you need to work with people.\n\n248\n00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:33.490\nSo giving them the option to propose\na new time is always really nice.\n\n249\n00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.870\nSo why don't we do one of\nthem will propose a new time.\n\n250\n00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:40.481\nLet's go accept this one, just for now.\n\n251\n00:13:40.481 --> 00:13:42.550\nAnd then we'll go over to Lance.\n\n252\n00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.960\nLance will be the one that's\nhaving to propose a new time.\n\n253\n00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.130\nSo that way we can see all\nthe different options.\n\n254\n00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.980\nSo I'm gonna yep,\nI'd like to go ahead and accept.\n\n255\n00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.806\nNotice that it says\nthe meeting has been accepted.\n\n256\n00:13:53.806 --> 00:13:55.432\nIt will be moved to your calendar.\n\n257\n00:13:55.432 --> 00:13:58.520\nDo you want to include\ncomments with your response?\n\n258\n00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:04.310\nThis is me as Justine\nresponding to Joey's request.\n\n259\n00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:08.990\nNow if I just choose send the response\nnow, and click okay, I'm just saying okay.\n\n260\n00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.572\nJoey will get that answer.\n\n261\n00:14:09.572 --> 00:14:14.689\nIt will be added to my calendar as Justin,\nand that's great or I could edit\n\n262\n00:14:14.689 --> 00:14:20.231\nthis because maybe I would like to add,\nhey cant wait to be there super excited.\n\n263\n00:14:20.231 --> 00:14:25.128\nYou can go and edit the response and\ndon't send a response would be that\n\n264\n00:14:25.128 --> 00:14:28.863\nyou just accept it and\nyou don't send anything back.\n\n265\n00:14:28.863 --> 00:14:33.520\nI would be nice and\nprobably choose one of the top two.\n\n266\n00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.600\nSo lets go this edit\njust to see that option.\n\n267\n00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.560\nWe click OK.\n\n268\n00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:44.530\nNotice that it brings up accepted\nto the tour meeting to Joey.\n\n269\n00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:51.181\nAll the lens are like,\nexcited excited to talk.\n\n270\n00:14:51.181 --> 00:14:53.207\nOkay, perfect.\n\n271\n00:14:53.207 --> 00:14:56.840\n[LAUGH] And it says, yes, I will attend.\n\n272\n00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.610\nWe click Send.\n\n273\n00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.390\nThat email gets sent off to Joey.\n\n274\n00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.470\nLet's jump down into JT's calendar.\n\n275\n00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:07.960\nIf I scroll down a little bit into,\nthere it is.\n\n276\n00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.300\nIt didn't keep the category,\nokay, well that's good.\n\n277\n00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.340\nWell honestly that's\nprobably a good thing.\n\n278\n00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.510\nI said it came over with it but\n\n279\n00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:21.710\nI just realized that the categories\nmean something to me in my Outlook.\n\n280\n00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:25.527\nSo JT might have a yellow category that\nmeans something completely different.\n\n281\n00:15:25.527 --> 00:15:29.527\nSo let me correct myself [LAUGH]\nright here and say that Joey,\n\n282\n00:15:29.527 --> 00:15:31.373\nas a meeting coordinator.\n\n283\n00:15:31.373 --> 00:15:33.614\nHe went ahead and made it a category for\n\n284\n00:15:33.614 --> 00:15:36.847\nhim because his organization\nmeans something to him.\n\n285\n00:15:36.847 --> 00:15:43.155\nJT could categorize it something\ndifferently for him as opposed to Joey.\n\n286\n00:15:43.155 --> 00:15:46.763\nSo, I stand corrected that is\nthat we know now that is that\n\n287\n00:15:46.763 --> 00:15:49.330\nturns into a teachable moment, right?\n\n288\n00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:54.502\n[LAUGH] So now we know that anybody could\ncategorize things how they Want to know\n\n289\n00:15:54.502 --> 00:15:59.620\nhow to do it, and I can have it right\nhere on my calendart that's wonderful.\n\n290\n00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.200\nAnd I already accepted,\nso those are the buttons.\n\n291\n00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.720\nSee, those are the buttons\nI was talking about,\n\n292\n00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:08.380\nand that's where I'm opening up\nthe actual meeting on J2's calendar.\n\n293\n00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.444\nPerfect, let's move back over to Joey.\n\n294\n00:16:10.444 --> 00:16:12.680\nLet's see what Joey's seeing over here.\n\n295\n00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:18.410\nIf i go over to his mail Joey sees that,\ngood, awesome.\n\n296\n00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.342\nSo we've got that everybody is here,\nthe reason why this is happening,\n\n297\n00:16:22.342 --> 00:16:24.411\nI'm just gonna tell you this right now.\n\n298\n00:16:24.411 --> 00:16:25.780\nYou're like, why do I have this twice?\n\n299\n00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.875\nLittle sidenote,\nI forgot to turn this off.\n\n300\n00:16:29.875 --> 00:16:34.760\n[LAUGH] Joey is a delegate of\n\n301\n00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.410\nJT's account if you wanna go back and\n\n302\n00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:43.660\nwatch this share multiple\naccounts in the email section.\n\n303\n00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:50.860\nWe talked about how JT gave\naccess to both Joey and Lance.\n\n304\n00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:56.810\nAnd that's the reason why this\nis coming up in my as Joey's\n\n305\n00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.700\nemail box is because I\nalso manage JT's calendar.\n\n306\n00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.550\nSo this normally would not happen\nto you if you don't have access,\n\n307\n00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:09.650\nif you're not a delegate of somebody\nelse's account so let's pretend,\n\n308\n00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:13.790\nwe'll do that hand wave right here like\nthat wasn't suppose to happen [LAUGH] but\n\n309\n00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.780\nyou would get the accepted.\n\n310\n00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:20.230\nEmail right here that good I'm glad\nto see that Justin has accepted\n\n311\n00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.320\nmy meeting request.\n\n312\n00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.550\nI could open this and look and\nsay that's wonderful perfect.\n\n313\n00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:30.170\nThis is just an email to Joey\nknowing that Justin said yes.\n\n314\n00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:36.144\nBefore I move over to Lance cuz\nwhat we're gonna do with Lance's\n\n315\n00:17:36.144 --> 00:17:38.609\nresponse Joey is the organizer.\n\n316\n00:17:38.609 --> 00:17:40.900\nWhat about tracking who is responding?\n\n317\n00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:45.160\nBecause I have three people, maybe I have\n30 people invited to this meeting, and\n\n318\n00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.170\nI wanna make sure I, cuz people,\n\n319\n00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:51.390\nthe emails keep coming in that\nthey're responding, but who said what?\n\n320\n00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:55.590\nComing back over to the calendar and\n\n321\n00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.400\nscroll down to the 3 o'clock meeting.\n\n322\n00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:04.350\nI open the meeting itself up in my\nas the organizer's calendar and\n\n323\n00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.783\nthere is a tracking right here.\n\n324\n00:18:06.783 --> 00:18:10.554\nI could come down here,\nI can view the tracking status And\n\n325\n00:18:10.554 --> 00:18:14.956\nnotice that it's giving me all\nthe list of attendees and whether or\n\n326\n00:18:14.956 --> 00:18:18.580\nnot they have responded\nwith an acceptance or not.\n\n327\n00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.510\nSo that's always a good\nthing to go ahead and\n\n328\n00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.420\nkeep that tracking there\nas the organizer and\n\n329\n00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:27.980\nthen you could always copy the status to a\nclipboard and then put that into an email\n\n330\n00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:32.200\nbecause maybe we just send it to somebody\nthat you're working with and coordinating\n\n331\n00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.510\nwith that meeting and then you can just\npaste it into that and send it off.\n\n332\n00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.660\nSo it's kinda like a status update.\n\n333\n00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.990\nSo I wanted to hit up that tracking.\n\n334\n00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:44.990\nSo I have a few more things to\nlook at as the recipient of\n\n335\n00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:50.010\na meeting invitation, and\nproposing that new time.\n\n336\n00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:52.280\nSwitch on our real Lance,\nokay, here we go.\n\n337\n00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.402\nSo Lance is all grey.\n\n338\n00:18:54.402 --> 00:18:57.688\nThat castle grey, and I don't know,\nit's just in my brain.\n\n339\n00:18:57.688 --> 00:19:02.320\n[LAUGH] So I have Lance's email,\nlet's come over here.\n\n340\n00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.840\nWe can see that it has the tour.\n\n341\n00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.010\nWhat do I want to do with this?\n\n342\n00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:11.966\nI want for him to propose a new time.\n\n343\n00:19:11.966 --> 00:19:16.364\nNow, this is where you could decline and\npropose a new time.\n\n344\n00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:17.755\nYou could, which was kind of weird.\n\n345\n00:19:17.755 --> 00:19:19.951\nIt's like, okay so I'm not gonna come but\n\n346\n00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:22.640\nI'm gonna tell you what\ntime to schedule those for.\n\n347\n00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.610\nI like the tentative like,\nhey, I'd like to come.\n\n348\n00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:30.680\nSo put me on as like maybe but I really\ncan't make it at this particular time.\n\n349\n00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.270\nNotice that it says, knife of\nthe Scheduling Assistant like, hey well so\n\n350\n00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.600\nwhat time could you maybe go ahead and\ndo this?\n\n351\n00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.480\nI could say that everybody is a little\nbusy but I just needed to be put\n\n352\n00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:48.373\nback to 3:30 instead of 3, so\nI can see what's going on here.\n\n353\n00:19:48.373 --> 00:19:49.780\nOkay, perfect.\n\n354\n00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.240\nI can see people's schedule.\n\n355\n00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:56.540\nLet's propose a new time that I would\nlike to go ahead and set this to- Whoops.\n\n356\n00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.360\nI didn't- did I miss something?\n\n357\n00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.480\nLet's go back here.\n\n358\n00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.040\nLet's no, I don't want to save my changes.\n\n359\n00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:02.930\nLet's open this back up.\n\n360\n00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.838\nWe're gonna propose a new time.\n\n361\n00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:09.985\nOkay, I skipped a step, sorry guys.\n\n362\n00:20:09.985 --> 00:20:13.650\n[LAUGH] Right here, remember, as Lance,\n\n363\n00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:17.440\nI wanna propose a new time,\nthis is the current time.\n\n364\n00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:23.912\nFor me to propose it, and it gets all\nthe right way, instead of me typing it in,\n\n365\n00:20:23.912 --> 00:20:29.519\nI'm saying here that I propose\na 3:30 time instead of a 3 time.\n\n366\n00:20:29.519 --> 00:20:33.810\nSo you can see it kind of moves over,\nso I can see the overlapping schedules.\n\n367\n00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:34.610\nThat's what I want.\n\n368\n00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:37.430\nThat's the part I missed,\nsorry about that.\n\n369\n00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.050\nSo we will propose that new time.\n\n370\n00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:40.950\nNow there we go.\n\n371\n00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:42.630\nI was looking for this.\n\n372\n00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.684\nThis is being emailed to Joey from Lance,\n\n373\n00:20:45.684 --> 00:20:49.273\nthat the current meeting\nwas from three to four.\n\n374\n00:20:49.273 --> 00:20:53.763\nI'm proposing that it\ngoes to 3:30 to 4:30,\n\n375\n00:20:53.763 --> 00:20:59.050\nthe location do the same and\nnotice in the subject line that Joey\n\n376\n00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:05.061\nwill receive is new time propose and\nlike can we move back 30 minutes.\n\n377\n00:21:07.253 --> 00:21:11.315\nLet's send that to Joey.\n\n378\n00:21:11.315 --> 00:21:15.700\nWhoops, sorry my, hold on one second.\n\n379\n00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.930\nThere we go, okay all right, come on.\n\n380\n00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:19.845\nSee okay, my mouse is wait.\n\n381\n00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:20.905\nThere it is.\n\n382\n00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:22.017\nThat's that little trick, right Wes?\n\n383\n00:21:22.017 --> 00:21:22.925\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n384\n00:21:22.925 --> 00:21:24.925\nYeah, just a little bit\nof a swipe sometimes.\n\n385\n00:21:24.925 --> 00:21:26.816\nLuxury's a modern technology.\n\n386\n00:21:26.816 --> 00:21:30.304\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and when you're working with\nmultiple virtual machines on your Mac\n\n387\n00:21:30.304 --> 00:21:32.667\nlike I was trying,\nI was doing that zoom for you and\n\n388\n00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:34.595\nit just kind of freaked out a little bit.\n\n389\n00:21:34.595 --> 00:21:36.515\nSo all right, mouse is back.\n\n390\n00:21:36.515 --> 00:21:37.335\nWe can move on.\n\n391\n00:21:37.335 --> 00:21:41.539\nSo Lance is proposing this new\ntime to Joey, go ahead and send.\n\n392\n00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:48.090\nWe go back over here to Jolly,\nwe come back into his email\n\n393\n00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:52.370\nwe can see that Lance had\nproposed anytime, okay?\n\n394\n00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:57.560\nWell, I think that will be fine as\na meeting organizer and of course if you\n\n395\n00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.950\nhave 30 people and everybody is proposing\nin your time, this is what that option you\n\n396\n00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:04.630\nare like you don't get to propose on your\ntime, you can even decline or accept.\n\n397\n00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:08.590\nThat's cool with me but\neverybody telling me what other times,\n\n398\n00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.840\nI might get a little crazy on there.\n\n399\n00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.390\nSo yeah, I think that's good.\n\n400\n00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:16.680\nLet's go with accept proposals,\n\n401\n00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:21.280\nno instead view all proposals if multiple\npeople had been proposing new times.\n\n402\n00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.437\nI like it, we go ahead and\naccept the proposal notice that it brings\n\n403\n00:22:26.437 --> 00:22:31.778\nup a Window right now to say, hey,\nwell, if I'm accepting Lance's\n\n404\n00:22:31.778 --> 00:22:36.750\nproposal of a new time, I need to\ninform my other members of JT and\n\n405\n00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:41.021\nChris and everybody who was\njoined in on this meeting.\n\n406\n00:22:41.021 --> 00:22:43.467\nAnd say all right,\nwell this is a new time.\n\n407\n00:22:43.467 --> 00:22:47.212\nThis is where using those notes down at\nthe bottom can be really helpful, but\n\n408\n00:22:47.212 --> 00:22:49.377\nalso just watching where\nthe subject are and\n\n409\n00:22:49.377 --> 00:22:52.500\njust getting familiar with these\ndifferent medium requests.\n\n410\n00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.010\nSo that looks good.\n\n411\n00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:58.880\nNotice it tells me one accepted, one\ntentatively accepted, zero have declined,\n\n412\n00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.490\nand no other people, one or\nmore have proposed a new time.\n\n413\n00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:06.870\nPerfect, we click Send Update,\nthere's only one so.\n\n414\n00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:12.012\nNow my calendar as Joey,\nthe meeting has been moved to 3:30,\n\n415\n00:23:12.012 --> 00:23:16.219\nwe jump over to JT if you guys\nhave seen a pattern here,\n\n416\n00:23:16.219 --> 00:23:19.041\nit's all very seamless right now.\n\n417\n00:23:19.041 --> 00:23:21.415\nHey, as an organizer, I set this.\n\n418\n00:23:21.415 --> 00:23:23.856\nAs a receiver,\nhey these are the options that I can do.\n\n419\n00:23:23.856 --> 00:23:26.480\nIt goes ahead and as soon as you\nsay yes or no in your email,\n\n420\n00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.825\nit moves everything around in your\ncalendar, which is really nice.\n\n421\n00:23:29.825 --> 00:23:32.967\n&gt;&gt; And what I noticed is you didn't have\nto go individually, the old sneaker net,\n\n422\n00:23:32.967 --> 00:23:36.607\nto every single calendar, and\nmanually adjust that cuz that can seem\n\n423\n00:23:36.607 --> 00:23:39.197\nreally decentralized and\nreally disorganized.\n\n424\n00:23:39.197 --> 00:23:42.257\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nthat's the beauty of using Outlook for\n\n425\n00:23:42.257 --> 00:23:44.138\nthese different things with the meetings.\n\n426\n00:23:44.138 --> 00:23:45.648\nIt's all integrated.\n\n427\n00:23:45.648 --> 00:23:48.411\nYou get a message,\nit moves the calendar, you can do this.\n\n428\n00:23:48.411 --> 00:23:51.145\nAnd if once we cancel a meeting\nbecause Joey's gonna go ahead and\n\n429\n00:23:51.145 --> 00:23:54.246\ncancel in a second [LAUGH], then it\ngoes ahead and you say, okay, great.\n\n430\n00:23:54.246 --> 00:23:57.288\nI accept the cancellation, and\nthen it takes it off your Your calendar.\n\n431\n00:23:57.288 --> 00:23:59.958\nIt's beautiful how it all works together.\n\n432\n00:23:59.958 --> 00:24:04.216\nNotice as a receiver of\na different time that whether,\n\n433\n00:24:04.216 --> 00:24:07.930\nit doesn't matter to me\nas JT why he moved this.\n\n434\n00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:11.070\nIt's just hey,\ngood glad that you let me know.\n\n435\n00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.020\nI'm good with this.\n\n436\n00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.300\nI can accept this, and\nI don't even need to edit it.\n\n437\n00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.520\nI'm just gonna say yep, I'm good.\n\n438\n00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.065\nSend that response.\n\n439\n00:24:18.065 --> 00:24:20.310\nCome over to JT's calendar.\n\n440\n00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.560\nIt's been moved to 3:30, perfect.\n\n441\n00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.310\nSwitch back over to Joey.\n\n442\n00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.770\nGoing a little faster now.\n\n443\n00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:33.180\nNotice that yep,\nJustin accepted the meeting request.\n\n444\n00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:37.770\nAnd remember, that was that whole weird\nthing going on with my multiple inboxes.\n\n445\n00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.800\nCome over here to Lance, okay?\n\n446\n00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.240\nWe've got the same thing of hey,\nthis is the new time.\n\n447\n00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.080\nYep, I want this.\n\n448\n00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.380\nI'm gonna go right over here\non the reading pane as Lance.\n\n449\n00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.360\nAccept this.\n\n450\n00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.920\nSend it now, okay.\n\n451\n00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.990\nThis is again this kind of got\nmultiple inboxes going on here.\n\n452\n00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:59.370\nAnd now everybody has accepted.\n\n453\n00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:00.330\nThere we go.\n\n454\n00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.760\nJustin Timberlake has accepted.\n\n455\n00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.006\nSorry about the multiple stuff.\n\n456\n00:25:05.006 --> 00:25:05.870\nDid I just accept?\n\n457\n00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:09.180\nI think I just accepted on Lance's behalf.\n\n458\n00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:12.960\nOkay sorry getting a little confused\nwith all these multiple inboxes.\n\n459\n00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.100\nBut everybody has accepted the meeting.\n\n460\n00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.540\nEverybody's liking it.\n\n461\n00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:23.720\nI can come back as Joey\nto the original email.\n\n462\n00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.480\nLook at my tracking.\n\n463\n00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.850\nOkay, it looks like Justin has accepted.\n\n464\n00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:28.660\nLance didn't accept.\n\n465\n00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:33.960\nThat was the one where it started kicking\nin that Lance are also organizes and\n\n466\n00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.310\nmanages JT's calendar.\n\n467\n00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:40.060\nSo I think if we just go ahead and\naccept this one.\n\n468\n00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.180\nThere we go.\nNow accepted both of them.\n\n469\n00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:45.218\nAnd that should go ahead,\nwhoops, here we go.\n\n470\n00:25:45.218 --> 00:25:46.782\nJoey, keep it in check.\n\n471\n00:25:46.782 --> 00:25:49.610\n[LAUGH] So\nwe've got a couple different people.\n\n472\n00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:51.600\nThere!\nNow Lance has accepted.\n\n473\n00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.792\nAnd I'm glad that that is all working.\n\n474\n00:25:54.792 --> 00:26:00.579\nNow gotta remember to turn off and\nremove access to those multiple inboxes.\n\n475\n00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.520\nAnd now I can see,\nwith my tracking here, there we go,\n\n476\n00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.390\nI can see that Justin and\nLance has accepted and we're doing good.\n\n477\n00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:15.410\nSo we're tracking, we can see all\ndifferent sides of what's going on and\n\n478\n00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:18.200\njust like I had prefaced, if.\n\n479\n00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.720\nAs the meeting organizer Joey decides hey,\n\n480\n00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.620\nyou know what,\nthis isn't gonna work any more.\n\n481\n00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.080\nI have got to cancel this meeting.\n\n482\n00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.780\nSorry guys, something's come up.\n\n483\n00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.250\nI can come in as the organizer,\nremember I'm Joey right now.\n\n484\n00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:37.070\nWe cancel the meeting and then I could go\nahead and say I'm sorry, have to cancel.\n\n485\n00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.410\nWe'll just stop there.\n\n486\n00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:42.230\nI can send the cancellation.\n\n487\n00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:45.330\nSends out the cancellation, so\n\n488\n00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.120\nWes what do you think's gonna\nhappen when J T answers this?\n\n489\n00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:52.410\n&gt;&gt; Well I have a feeling that if\nconsistency shows us that it's going to be\n\n490\n00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:53.840\ncancelled across the board?\n\n491\n00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.400\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nIt'll be taken off of his calendar.\n\n492\n00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.990\nSo we'll take it right here.\n\n493\n00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:59.970\nWe'll say that hey, guess what?\n\n494\n00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.330\nSo it has been cancelled.\n\n495\n00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:03.570\nIt's right up there.\n\n496\n00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.550\nRemove from my calendar.\n\n497\n00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:09.170\nAs Justin takes it off my calendar so\n\n498\n00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:11.240\nI don't have a meeting anymore and\nthat's great.\n\n499\n00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:17.230\nSo all that kinda seamless integration is\nreally, really beautiful with Outlook.\n\n500\n00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:19.730\n&gt;&gt; A lotta great information\non meetings there Vonne and\n\n501\n00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:25.070\nI love how where you can just modify\nit in one little place there and\n\n502\n00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.220\nit modifies it across all the calendars.\n\n503\n00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.110\nWe don't have to go\ncompletely decentralized.\n\n504\n00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:32.850\nNow I am looking at the clock and\nit does look like we're running\n\n505\n00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:35.950\nshort on some time here but\nbefore we call it a day,\n\n506\n00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:38.380\ndo you have any final words you'd\nlike to impart to our viewers?\n\n507\n00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.660\n&gt;&gt; I have two small\nlittle things on here so.\n\n508\n00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.040\nWe were talking about creating\nmeetings in Outlook and\n\n509\n00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.360\nsetting it up to where it\nwas in Joey's office or\n\n510\n00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.840\nin a physical location, but\nthere's also online meetings.\n\n511\n00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.330\nWe have Skype meetings, right?\n\n512\n00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.750\nAnd Skype is a great feature for you to be\nable to use to go ahead and meet online.\n\n513\n00:27:55.750 --> 00:28:01.900\nAnd Skype does tie in,\nright into your Office 365 account.\n\n514\n00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.820\nAnd so if you have Skype for business\nset up and you can go ahead and do that.\n\n515\n00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:10.590\nNow if you don't have Skype for business\non your computer, that might start to be\n\n516\n00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:15.300\nlike you might not wanna schedule a Skype\nmeeting if you don't have that configured.\n\n517\n00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:19.371\nOkay, but i get these all the time like\neither a google hangout request or\n\n518\n00:28:19.371 --> 00:28:21.370\na request for a Skype meeting.\n\n519\n00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.200\nAnd even if I'm not on it,\nI can click on it and it will install.\n\n520\n00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.530\nSo its not too terribly difficult but\n\n521\n00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:32.000\njust make sure you know that if\nsomebody is not set up on it,\n\n522\n00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:38.022\nit could sometimes be a more trouble for\nthem than, can we just get on the phone?\n\n523\n00:28:38.022 --> 00:28:39.810\nBut let me show you how to do it.\n\n524\n00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:40.990\nLet's go back over to Joey.\n\n525\n00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:45.502\nI'm going to come over here to\na new meeting, a new Skype meeting.\n\n526\n00:28:45.502 --> 00:28:50.290\nAnd when I click on a new Skype meeting,\ngive it a second,\n\n527\n00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:54.400\nnotice how it goes ahead and puts all\nof the details right here in the notes.\n\n528\n00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.160\nHey join this Skype meeting.\n\n529\n00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.000\nTrouble joining?\n\n530\n00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:57.960\nTry Skype for web.\n\n531\n00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.822\nSo if somebody doesn't have it installed,\nthey could always do the web interface.\n\n532\n00:29:00.822 --> 00:29:05.340\nSo this is actually pretty, I don't wanna\nsay pretty easy because as soon as you use\n\n533\n00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.981\nthat terminology people are like,\nwell, it's easy for you.\n\n534\n00:29:07.981 --> 00:29:12.500\n[LAUGH] It's, they try to make\nit as seamless as possible.\n\n535\n00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.290\nAnd notice you could do\na whole teleconference.\n\n536\n00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:19.880\nYou could join in via just the phone,\nnot with a camera and\n\n537\n00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.080\na microphone through the computer.\n\n538\n00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.240\nSo there's different ways that\nyou can bring this in it so\n\n539\n00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.390\nshows that it has a conference ID.\n\n540\n00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:27.590\nEverything is setup for\n\n541\n00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:32.330\ntrying to get multiple access\nto an online meeting to people.\n\n542\n00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:33.790\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n543\n00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:37.500\naddress this to JT just to give you\na quick little point right here.\n\n544\n00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.905\nI'll send that out I guess I should,\nI didn't put a subject.\n\n545\n00:29:40.905 --> 00:29:47.200\n[LAUGH] So let's go ahead and\nnot send, and we'll do Skype test.\n\n546\n00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.470\nWe'll send that off.\n\n547\n00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:49.960\nJust to show you really quickly,\n\n548\n00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.900\nwhen that gets received to that person\nthey'll be able to click on that link.\n\n549\n00:29:54.900 --> 00:30:00.280\nI'm not switching over to JT right now\nbecause I do have this set up as Joey.\n\n550\n00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:05.400\nSo notice that if I click on this\nit does come right into Skype for\n\n551\n00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.540\nbusiness, that is set up.\n\n552\n00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.560\nNotice that it says, hey, do you want to\nuse Skype for Business or call me at.\n\n553\n00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.630\nSo you can see those different options.\n\n554\n00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:16.520\nI'm gonna click OK just to show\nyou that it will go ahead and\n\n555\n00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.290\nget me into the window that says, hey,\n\n556\n00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:20.490\nlooks like you're the only\none on this call right now.\n\n557\n00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:25.180\nBut you have your same buttons for hey,\nshare your microphone, share your screen.\n\n558\n00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.030\nYou can be able to see everybody.\n\n559\n00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:30.460\nSo if you've done any\ntype of Skyping before,\n\n560\n00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:35.130\nit's all integrated right into here\nbecause Skype is part of Microsoft.\n\n561\n00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:37.970\nAnd so it's nice and\nseamless that you could put as\n\n562\n00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:42.440\nan invitation to a Skype business\nmeeting in your calendar.\n\n563\n00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.440\nI'm going to go ahead and\nclose all that stuff.\n\n564\n00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.940\nClose, close, close, close.\n\n565\n00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.900\nThe last one I wanted to\nmention is the meeting notes.\n\n566\n00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.790\nThis is another application,\njust like Skype is a separate application.\n\n567\n00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:54.470\nOneNote, OneNote's pretty awesome, okay.\n\n568\n00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:59.170\nThere is some things that you do\nhave to set up and I do have a link.\n\n569\n00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:03.440\nI have a URL for something off\nthe Microsoft support so go ahead and\n\n570\n00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.885\ncheck out those show notes that\nare attached to this episode and\n\n571\n00:31:06.885 --> 00:31:07.815\nbe able to click that one.\n\n572\n00:31:07.815 --> 00:31:13.155\nSo you're going to have to setup\na notebook in OneNote first,\n\n573\n00:31:13.155 --> 00:31:18.175\nand in OneNote, not Outlook,\nin OneNote you can then attach\n\n574\n00:31:18.175 --> 00:31:23.000\nthat particular notebook to\na meeting in your calendar and so\n\n575\n00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.280\nwhen you open it you can\ngo right to that notebook.\n\n576\n00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.610\nI'll do it really quickly for you.\n\n577\n00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:31.270\nI have OneNote on my computer,\nOneNote 2016,\n\n578\n00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:35.020\nnot the one that's part\nof your operating system.\n\n579\n00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:40.190\nSo I come into here, I already have\na notebook created called VMA Notes.\n\n580\n00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:41.150\nSo I have this.\n\n581\n00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:47.140\nNotice over here on the right-hand side\nof this ribbon, I have Meeting Details.\n\n582\n00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:50.140\nAnd so\nit's connected right into my Outlook.\n\n583\n00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:55.225\nSo if I wanted to set what meeting,\nor what appointment,\n\n584\n00:31:55.225 --> 00:31:59.855\nI want to have associated with this,\nwe'll go with this one.\n\n585\n00:31:59.855 --> 00:32:04.685\nSo yes, this is the OneNote notebook that\nI want to associate with this particular\n\n586\n00:32:04.685 --> 00:32:07.515\nmeeting that is on my calendar.\n\n587\n00:32:07.515 --> 00:32:10.935\nI can insert the details, and\nnotice how look, it's right in here.\n\n588\n00:32:10.935 --> 00:32:15.440\nAnd it puts it right over here to\nthe side and everything is ready to go.\n\n589\n00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:22.520\nIf I comeback over here to Outlook,\nnow if I open up that VMA performance and\n\n590\n00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:26.730\nI open this up, and I'll just go ahead and\nadjust this for now to give you an option.\n\n591\n00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:28.400\nMeeting notes at the top.\n\n592\n00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.578\nTake notes on your own.\n\n593\n00:32:29.578 --> 00:32:32.280\nNotice look at how it goes right on over\n\n594\n00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.140\ninto now I have this associated with\nthe marketing meeting notes, so\n\n595\n00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:38.700\nthis is something a little,\nI kinda went a little crazy on this one.\n\n596\n00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:43.730\nBut I'm just trying to show you that\nyou can connect your OneNote Office\n\n597\n00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:49.060\n365 in your OneDrive account, OneNote,\nOneDrive [LAUGH] all up into there.\n\n598\n00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.770\nAssociate with a meeting.\n\n599\n00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:53.890\nTalk to each other, go ahead and type\nyour notes and it's all right in there.\n\n600\n00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:55.130\nIt's a beautiful thing.\n\n601\n00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:56.980\nSo definitely check out that URL.\n\n602\n00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.300\nI know those little quick\nlittle gloss over but\n\n603\n00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.070\nat least I wanted to throw\nthat out to you I think.\n\n604\n00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.880\nNow I'm done.\n[LAUGH]\n\n605\n00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.380\n&gt;&gt; All

Bryan.\n\n3\n00:00:09.531 --> 00:00:11.221\nAnd we got a great episode for you today,\n\n4\n00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:15.490\nwe're coming back with more Office\n365 specifically looking at Outlook.\n\n5\n00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.640\nAnd joining us back in the studios today\nis none other than Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n6\n00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.318\nHow you doing today Vonne?\n\n7\n00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:21.570\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.810\nWe're going to be sharing and\ntransferring our calendars to\n\n9\n00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.170\nother people because its no\nfun to just have it on me.\n\n10\n00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.570\nWe have to share it with the world.\n\n11\n00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.160\nSo I had to go ahead and learn how to\nshare my calendar with my coworkers.\n\n12\n00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.040\nGo ahead and set those permissions.\n\n13\n00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.900\nAnd what if I am leaving a job or leaving\na specific account and transferring over.\n\n14\n00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.500\nMaybe I'm going from Outlook to Google.\n\n15\n00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.980\nMaybe I'm going from Google to Outlook,\nwhich way are we gonna go?\n\n16\n00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.810\nSo we'll go ahead and\n\n17\n00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.330\nshow you those different things that you\ncan do with importing and exporting.\n\n18\n00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.320\nWe do have some good references along\nthe way of our office support online.\n\n19\n00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.200\nThose help files that actually,\nvery, very helpful for\n\n20\n00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.530\nus which I'm glad they've kind of evolved.\n\n21\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.070\nBecause some of our help files\nthroughout the years have been like,\n\n22\n00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.124\nthat's not doing anything for me.\n\n23\n00:01:09.124 --> 00:01:12.430\nSo [LAUGH] but definitely consult\nthe office support online and\n\n24\n00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.020\nit will give you a lot of different\ntopics for what you're looking for.\n\n25\n00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.790\nBecause I know I look at them, so\nI'm gonna have you look at them too.\n\n26\n00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.890\nSo before we get started I do have a\ncouple, I wanna almost do clarifications.\n\n27\n00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.750\nSome of you might not be\nwatching this in succession.\n\n28\n00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.710\nSome of you might be watching succession,\nbut\n\n29\n00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.440\nwe did have a whole episode on meetings.\n\n30\n00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.070\nSo I wanted to jump into our computer and\n\n31\n00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.470\njust give you a couple\nlittle pointers to go out.\n\n32\n00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.280\nBecause we are making as Joey,\nwe were meeting creator and\n\n33\n00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.840\nwe were inviting people into our meeting.\n\n34\n00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.800\nNow, just to clarify, and\ni did mention this that JT delegated\n\n35\n00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.960\naccess to both Lance and to Joey, okay.\n\n36\n00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.600\nAnd this is kind of perfect because\nwe did this in the share and\n\n37\n00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.970\nmanaged multiple email accounts,\nthat whole episode we talked about it.\n\n38\n00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.450\nAnd I left all of those settings on.\n\n39\n00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.320\nSo if you are ever in that situation to\nwhere you are a meeting organizer, but\n\n40\n00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.510\nyou're also inviting the person that\nyou're [LAUGH] managing their calendar and\n\n41\n00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.680\nhave access to everything.\n\n42\n00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.120\nYou always gonna make sure you know\nwhere you're at because if I look at,\n\n43\n00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.170\nthis is Joe's account,\nI'm gonna scroll on up here.\n\n44\n00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.020\nNow, he was a meeting coordinator, but\n\n45\n00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.240\nlook at this one,\nsee right here was where it says tour.\n\n46\n00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.280\nThis is the original one,\nnow we've set cancel that, but\n\n47\n00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.330\nI just wanted you right here Received for\nJustin Timberlake.\n\n48\n00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.430\nAlways watch that, okay, because if you\nare organizing multiple accounts you need\n\n49\n00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.077\nto make sure with those emails coming\nin of who you're at right now.\n\n50\n00:02:49.077 --> 00:02:53.200\nBut in the sharing of the emails we\ntalked about well, the inbox for\n\n51\n00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.860\nJustin Timberlake is down here.\n\n52\n00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.430\nSo, I'm in Joey's in boxes,\nso why am I getting?\n\n53\n00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.192\nThat's just how it works when you delegate\nthat access, it's just kind of like,\n\n54\n00:03:05.192 --> 00:03:10.384\nit's just reminding you as Joey,\nhey, you also control JT's account.\n\n55\n00:03:10.384 --> 00:03:14.585\nSo I'm making sure that you know\nthere's a meeting request for\n\n56\n00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:18.320\nJustin Timberlake,\neven though you're the creator.\n\n57\n00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.120\nSo we're clear in there?\n\n58\n00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.880\nI mean even for me cause I have\nto demonstrate all these and\n\n59\n00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.880\nall those accounts, and\nremember that I had access.\n\n60\n00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.440\nSo, I just wanted to kind of share\nthat with you and its part of sharing\n\n61\n00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.610\ncalendars with each other and access,\nso I just wanted to throw that in there.\n\n62\n00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.220\n&gt;&gt; So be careful because you could get\nyourself in a situation where your\n\n63\n00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.981\nflooding your own inbox very,\nvery quickly.\n\n64\n00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:43.447\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, exactly.\n\n65\n00:03:43.447 --> 00:03:45.996\nAnd you have do just what\nI'm doing of like, who am I?\n\n66\n00:03:45.996 --> 00:03:48.880\n[LAUGH] Who am I controlling?\n\n67\n00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.920\nExactly, so and the other one I wanted\nto just point out is I mentioned that\n\n68\n00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.020\ninviting people to a meeting that is\nnot on Outlook will Chrisca Patrick,\n\n69\n00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.870\nthe one, I have him as a Gmail.\n\n70\n00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.570\nThis is a different meeting that I\ndemonstrated in that particular episode.\n\n71\n00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.379\nBut I wanted to show you that\nwhen you have somebody that\n\n72\n00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.470\naccepts your meeting from Gmail.\n\n73\n00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.260\nIt does the same thing.\n\n74\n00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.020\nIt says, Google Calendar has accepted\nthis meeting on behalf of Chris.\n\n75\n00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.550\nIt goes ahead and\n\n76\n00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:24.690\nlets you know that this person has\naccepted your invitation to your meeting.\n\n77\n00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.290\nAnd I'm just gonna switch on over to\nLance, because on Lance's computer,\n\n78\n00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.330\nI do have right here.\n\n79\n00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.650\nThis is Chris's Gmail account,\nand this is his Gmail calendar.\n\n80\n00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.160\nThat when he accepted,\n\n81\n00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.420\nit put it right into his calendar\non his Google Calendar too.\n\n82\n00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.810\nSo going across those different\naccounts not in Outlook,\n\n83\n00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.260\nit still can work and\nyou can still go ahead and\n\n84\n00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.360\nmanage and be in the loop,\nif you wanna say, with everything.\n\n85\n00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.400\nSo I just wanted to make those two\nlittle points before we get into how\n\n86\n00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.080\nwe're gonna share and transfer a calendar.\n\n87\n00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.800\nSo go back and\nwatch that meetings episode, and\n\n88\n00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.870\nyou'll know what I'm talking about.\n\n89\n00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.280\nWhere are we gonna start?\n\n90\n00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.640\nSo, we did go in our appointments.\n\n91\n00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.680\nWe can always forward\nan appointment to somebody.\n\n92\n00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.120\nAnd that's a part of how we can share.\n\n93\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.193\nAnd that's where Joey went ahead and\nforwarded his appointment\n\n94\n00:05:17.193 --> 00:05:22.230\nto Lance by just clicking on that\nparticular appointment or meeting, really.\n\n95\n00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.570\nAnd then forwarding it along to somebody.\n\n96\n00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.510\nSo just as a quick reminder of\nhow we do this, I'm back in Joey.\n\n97\n00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.360\nLet's go ahead and\nget over into his calendar.\n\n98\n00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.990\nIf I wanted to for, this one where I was,\nthis is past due, but\n\n99\n00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.890\nwhen I was working with Daniel.\n\n100\n00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.024\nIf I wanted to forward that I\ncould go ahead and do that.\n\n101\n00:05:41.024 --> 00:05:45.568\nWe did determine that you could do this\nas an Outlook item, that would just be\n\n102\n00:05:45.568 --> 00:05:50.543\nforward or as an iCalendar because we are\ntalking about transferring and sharing.\n\n103\n00:05:50.543 --> 00:05:55.600\nThe iCal, the iCalendar format is\nsomething that you can go from across\n\n104\n00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.770\ndifferent platforms meaning to Yahoo, or\nto Google, and not just Outlook specific.\n\n105\n00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.040\nSo you could always forward that on,\nand that's one way of sharing.\n\n106\n00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.420\nAnother thing you can do if you\nare on an exchange server, and\n\n107\n00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.970\nyou're all on the same network,\nis you can open other people's calendar.\n\n108\n00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.190\nThat's where setting those private\nappointments that we talked about\n\n109\n00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.300\nin our appointments episode, you wanna\nmake sure that, hey, if you don't\n\n110\n00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.040\nwant other people to see what's going on,\nmake sure you hit that private button.\n\n111\n00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.420\nAnd so they can't see the details.\n\n112\n00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.680\n&gt;&gt; In that other episode, Vonne you did\ntell us that hey, it's nice to have that\n\n113\n00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.080\nindustry wide format cuz we can\nshare it across multiple platforms.\n\n114\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.600\nIs there anything like functionality\nthat you might lose if you're sharing it\n\n115\n00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.740\noutside of Outlook, and\nmaybe sharing it to another platform?\n\n116\n00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.640\nIs there anything as far as\njust viewing the calendar,\n\n117\n00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.900\nor do you lose functionality that way?\n\n118\n00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.214\n&gt;&gt; You shouldn't necessarily\nuse functionality,\n\n119\n00:06:49.214 --> 00:06:52.252\nlike the details should be there and\nhow something maps to other.\n\n120\n00:06:52.252 --> 00:06:54.621\nWe talked about when we did contacts,\n\n121\n00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:59.230\nthe field mapping of like this first\nname go to first name and each one.\n\n122\n00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.090\nBut it's such a universal format that\nyou shouldn't lose any of the details.\n\n123\n00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.798\nNow it functions within that platform,\nthat could be, slightly different because\n\n124\n00:07:07.798 --> 00:07:12.400\na Google Calendar doesn't work exactly\nlike outlook, but the information should\n\n125\n00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.030\nall be there,\nthat's of course the tried and true.\n\n126\n00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.545\nEverything should work beautifully\n[LAUGH] doesn't always work that way.\n\n127\n00:07:22.545 --> 00:07:27.262\n[SOUND] Real life and\nour steps don´t always coincide but for\n\n128\n00:07:27.262 --> 00:07:32.462\nthe most part, you should be able\nto go across it and be just fine.\n\n129\n00:07:32.462 --> 00:07:34.180\nSo, good point.\n\n130\n00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:39.180\nSo on Joey here,\nif he wanted to open Lance's calendar,\n\n131\n00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.650\nthey're all one Office Pro Demo Co,\nhe could do that.\n\n132\n00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.580\nAnd I had mentioned this in the interface\none is I would do this all the time\n\n133\n00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.350\nback in university.\n\n134\n00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.519\nI would just go ahead and\nopen up everybody's calendar,\n\n135\n00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:51.602\njust to see what they're doing so I could\ngo ahead and help schedule the meeting.\n\n136\n00:07:51.602 --> 00:07:53.945\nSo where do you go to do that?\n\n137\n00:07:53.945 --> 00:07:57.470\nIf I go over here to\nthe home tab of my calendar.\n\n138\n00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.311\nArea.\n\n139\n00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:04.110\nAnd I go to Open Calendar, and\nI can open this from my address book.\n\n140\n00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.684\nAnd I'm coming into my global\naddress list right here.\n\n141\n00:08:07.684 --> 00:08:14.570\nAnd if I wanted to bring up Lance's\ncalendar, and I click okay.\n\n142\n00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.580\nIt will open up Lance's calendar\nover here it's updating so\n\n143\n00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.680\nit's taking a little bit of time to go\nahead and grab all that information.\n\n144\n00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.744\nBut I can go ahead and see everything\nthat he's doing, there we go.\n\n145\n00:08:25.744 --> 00:08:31.780\nNotice I can see he's free at this point,\nI can see tentative, I see busy.\n\n146\n00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.794\nI see some other things on here so\nI can open it just fine.\n\n147\n00:08:34.794 --> 00:08:38.130\nAnd notice that it comes over\ninto the shared calendars.\n\n148\n00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:39.552\nNow this is a little mm-hm,\n\n149\n00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:42.871\nyou're not really sharing right now\nbecause if I came over here and\n\n150\n00:08:42.871 --> 00:08:46.560\nsaid, well let me go ahead and\ntry to open this up, look what it says.\n\n151\n00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.870\nIt says you do not have\npermission to create an entry.\n\n152\n00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.960\nYou don't have permissions to\nlike see all of that stuff.\n\n153\n00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.480\nBut if you wanted to you would go ahead\nand make sure you check the permissions.\n\n154\n00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.010\nAnd then ask, set the folder on your\nadministrator to change your permissions.\n\n155\n00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.530\nSo you have to go ahead and\nbasically ask for permission.\n\n156\n00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.470\nSo it's a little, I would say misleading.\n\n157\n00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.010\nBecause this is not a shared calendar,\nyou've just opened it up.\n\n158\n00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:17.490\nIt's a view only type of access\nbecause you're on that same network.\n\n159\n00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:23.770\nSo opening is not the same as\npermissions or sharing calendars.\n\n160\n00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:27.540\nSo just wanted to clarify that.\n\n161\n00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.680\nAnd why you can do that.\n\n162\n00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.170\nSo we've got our shared calender's\nwell kind of we really just opened it.\n\n163\n00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.640\nYou can unchecked these over here.\n\n164\n00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.650\nNow I did want, I said I don't think I\npointed this out in my other episodes.\n\n165\n00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:41.447\nIf you come over here to Lance.\n\n166\n00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:46.080\nLance had, [LAUGH] Lance had\nhis cat's calendar, right?\n\n167\n00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.094\nSo, [LAUGH] when Daniel was with me,\n\n168\n00:09:49.094 --> 00:09:53.120\nwe had grand old time\nwith the Siamese Sundays.\n\n169\n00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.005\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\nYes and the Persian parade.\n\n170\n00:09:56.005 --> 00:09:58.448\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No Russian Blues in there, darn.\n\n171\n00:09:58.448 --> 00:10:01.980\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I had a Russian Blue,\nhis name was Sasha.\n\n172\n00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.330\nMy little baby.\n\n173\n00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:08.481\nYeah, so but then I was like Russian,\nI couldn't find that whole iteration type.\n\n174\n00:10:08.481 --> 00:10:10.577\nLike yeah, so that's what we want.\n\n175\n00:10:10.577 --> 00:10:11.329\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n176\n00:10:11.329 --> 00:10:11.991\n&gt;&gt; Anyways,\n\n177\n00:10:11.991 --> 00:10:14.770\nhow did he make this calendar, okay?\n\n178\n00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:18.531\nAnd maybe that's another calendar that you\nwanna then share out the permissions to\n\n179\n00:10:18.531 --> 00:10:20.850\nsomebody else which we'll\nget to in just a second.\n\n180\n00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.789\nSo I just wanted to throw that in cuz I\nfeel like I didn't cover it just yet.\n\n181\n00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.981\nYou come over here to the home tab and\nyou go over to new items.\n\n182\n00:10:28.981 --> 00:10:32.926\nYou might look at this and be like,\nI don't see like a new calendar in here.\n\n183\n00:10:32.926 --> 00:10:35.694\nIf you come down into your My Calendars,\nI clicked that and\n\n184\n00:10:35.694 --> 00:10:38.010\nit actually gave me all of\nthe calendars right away.\n\n185\n00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.838\nLet me uncheck some of those there.\n\n186\n00:10:39.838 --> 00:10:44.510\nYou can right-click on a calendar,\nthat's actually a calendar group.\n\n187\n00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.373\nLet me go, there it is.\n\n188\n00:10:45.373 --> 00:10:47.000\nAdd Calendar.\n\n189\n00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.250\nSo I can go ahead and do here, or I could\nalso just go ahead, I keep doing that.\n\n190\n00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.918\nI can right-click on the calendar\nnot the group, okay.\n\n191\n00:10:54.918 --> 00:10:59.340\nYou go ahead that's where I realized when\nI right-clicked I'm in the wrong place.\n\n192\n00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.795\nThis is not where you go ahead and\nadd a new calendar.\n\n193\n00:11:00.795 --> 00:11:04.860\n[LAUGH] You go ahead and\nadd a new calendar here.\n\n194\n00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:09.535\nAnd then I could name this Dog Calendar,\ncuz if we got a calendar,\n\n195\n00:11:09.535 --> 00:11:13.112\nwe have one for cats,\nwe should have one for dogs.\n\n196\n00:11:13.112 --> 00:11:16.820\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nput that into the calendar.\n\n197\n00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:21.020\nYou click OK and\nnotice that it adds it right here.\n\n198\n00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.710\nBut I could also move this.\n\n199\n00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.550\nSo if I wanted,\nhere let me check all these guys.\n\n200\n00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:30.970\nI could take this and I could move\nit down into the other calendars.\n\n201\n00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.044\nAnd that way I can go ahead and\norganize it for myself.\n\n202\n00:11:34.044 --> 00:11:38.790\nSo you don't have to only have one\ncalendar, you can have multiple calendars.\n\n203\n00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:43.130\nAnd then you can go ahead and\nstart creating the different\n\n204\n00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:47.860\ndog show appointments and meetings that\nyou have on this particular calendar\n\n205\n00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.900\nthat is separate then your\nJoey Calendar over here.\n\n206\n00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.488\nAnd that way you can do that.\n\n207\n00:11:53.488 --> 00:11:57.010\nSo its not necessarily,\nwell you could share it like I said but\n\n208\n00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:00.110\nI wanted to throw that out there to\nmake sure you know where to get it.\n\n209\n00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.722\nSo what about sharing calendars?\n\n210\n00:12:03.722 --> 00:12:06.987\nOkay, I've decided that as\nJoey I would like Lance,\n\n211\n00:12:06.987 --> 00:12:09.830\nI'd like to share my\ncalendar out with Lance.\n\n212\n00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:13.471\nSo that way he could see things and\nI can give him certain permissions.\n\n213\n00:12:13.471 --> 00:12:16.640\nI could give him where he\ncan access just the details.\n\n214\n00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.890\nHe could either make appointments for me.\n\n215\n00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.590\nDoes he see my private details?\n\n216\n00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.150\nAll those different things.\n\n217\n00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.190\nSo how do I share this\nparticular calendar?\n\n218\n00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.456\nI am Joey.\nI come up here to my home tab of my ribbon\n\n219\n00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:31.936\nand you've got right there,\nshare calendar.\n\n220\n00:12:31.936 --> 00:12:33.970\nI click it.\n\n221\n00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.360\nIt's going to create\nan email that's ready to go.\n\n222\n00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.932\nNow I have to address it to the person\nthat I want to share my calendar with and\n\n223\n00:12:40.932 --> 00:12:43.560\nit's not, there we go, there's Lance.\n\n224\n00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:48.287\nAnd so it's saying hey, Joey is asking,\nthis is going to be to Lance,\n\n225\n00:12:48.287 --> 00:12:51.264\nthat he is asking you\nto share his calendar.\n\n226\n00:12:51.264 --> 00:12:59.805\nNow as Joey I can request to\nget access to his calendar.\n\n227\n00:12:59.805 --> 00:13:02.876\nBecause if we're gonna share, cuz maybe I\nwanna be able to see what Lance is doing.\n\n228\n00:13:02.876 --> 00:13:05.872\nAnd be able to help control him because\nmaybe we'll work on our project together\n\n229\n00:13:05.872 --> 00:13:08.335\nso we really need access\nto each other's calendar.\n\n230\n00:13:08.335 --> 00:13:12.007\nYou can request permission to\ndo that person's calendar.\n\n231\n00:13:12.007 --> 00:13:18.060\nAnd this is where you get the details\nof what you can see on their calendar.\n\n232\n00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.060\nNotice or what they would be\nable to see on your calendar.\n\n233\n00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.780\nAnd notice that it says in\nthe availability it shows that the time\n\n234\n00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.330\nwill be shown as busy.\n\n235\n00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.680\nIf I change this to limited details,\n\n236\n00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.030\nnotice that it gives me\nthe subjects of the calendar items.\n\n237\n00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.980\nAnd then the full details would be like\nthe notes and everything that I could see.\n\n238\n00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:39.527\nSo what do I want them to\nbe able to see or not see.\n\n239\n00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:41.238\nLet's go limited details for\n\n240\n00:13:41.238 --> 00:13:44.599\nhere cuz I don't wanna have\nthem get everything in there.\n\n241\n00:13:44.599 --> 00:13:48.500\nAnd then something like they're whole like\ncan they see my private appointments?\n\n242\n00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.533\nThere's another set to this.\n\n243\n00:13:51.533 --> 00:13:55.397\nThis is right now I'm just giving them\non basis hey, you can see my calendar,\n\n244\n00:13:55.397 --> 00:13:57.490\nI'd like to be able to see your calendar.\n\n245\n00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:01.202\nAnd then I can set permission\nlevels after the fact.\n\n246\n00:14:01.202 --> 00:14:02.852\nI'll click send to Lance,\n\n247\n00:14:02.852 --> 00:14:06.880\nnotice that it says are you making\nsure that you're sharing this.\n\n248\n00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.849\nAnd it has limited details,\nthat's your permission level and you say,\n\n249\n00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:10.500\nyep I'm good.\n\n250\n00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.060\nGo ahead and gives us an old\nschool look for transferring.\n\n251\n00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.240\nWe're not really\ntransferring we're sharing.\n\n252\n00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.292\nAnd so now I've got that.\n\n253\n00:14:17.292 --> 00:14:25.810\nLet's switch over to Lance to see\nwhat he sees on the receiving end.\n\n254\n00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:32.257\nI come over to Lance's email and\nLance gets a, sharing request from Joey.\n\n255\n00:14:32.257 --> 00:14:35.516\nSo we open up the email that\nhas our sharing request and\n\n256\n00:14:35.516 --> 00:14:38.060\nyou can see I have my allow button or\ndeny.\n\n257\n00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.383\nBecause this is where I as Lance do\n\n258\n00:14:41.383 --> 00:14:46.520\nI want to allow Joey to be\nable to see my calendar?\n\n259\n00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.510\nBut also wanted to show you,\nI'm gonna close this.\n\n260\n00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:49.977\nYou could also do it\nfrom your reading pane.\n\n261\n00:14:49.977 --> 00:14:54.049\nAnd there's some like small little glitch\nright now that my allow button in that\n\n262\n00:14:54.049 --> 00:14:55.203\ndialog box won't, or\n\n263\n00:14:55.203 --> 00:14:59.180\nthe window it wasn't showing you the next\nprompt that I wanted it to show you.\n\n264\n00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.710\nSo you know what,\nwe'll just go the other way.\n\n265\n00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:02.383\nWe'll go from the reading pane.\n\n266\n00:15:02.383 --> 00:15:06.556\nAnd we will click allow because this\nis what I wanted to see it says okay,\n\n267\n00:15:06.556 --> 00:15:09.477\nwell hey,\nI'm responding back to Joey that yes,\n\n268\n00:15:09.477 --> 00:15:12.695\nI have allowed your sharing\nrequest to your calendar.\n\n269\n00:15:12.695 --> 00:15:16.780\nSo we're all good,\nI just wanted to make sure that you know.\n\n270\n00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.380\nThat we're sharing now.\n\n271\n00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.490\nSo we click send to Joey.\n\n272\n00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:24.992\nNotice that, remember Lance is also\nsharing his calendar with Joey.\n\n273\n00:15:24.992 --> 00:15:27.830\nSo it's kind of a mutual agreement.\n\n274\n00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:32.888\nWe click okay, and now we should be\nable to go ahead and be sharing.\n\n275\n00:15:32.888 --> 00:15:37.950\nNow it says on this one it says Joey has\nalso granted you access to your calendar.\n\n276\n00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:41.679\nClick the calendar button on the\ninvitation to add it to the folder pane in\n\n277\n00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:42.546\nyour calendar.\n\n278\n00:15:42.546 --> 00:15:47.208\nSo I like that it´s giving you just\na little bit of guidance like all right,\n\n279\n00:15:47.208 --> 00:15:52.169\nwell you allowed this request but now you\ncan go ahead and see Joey´s calandar.\n\n280\n00:15:52.169 --> 00:15:55.858\nBecause that´s the whole thing\nthat he wanted you to do as Lance.\n\n281\n00:15:55.858 --> 00:15:56.991\nTo be able to see his calendar.\n\n282\n00:15:56.991 --> 00:16:00.367\nSo right at the top it says,\nOpen This Calendar.\n\n283\n00:16:00.367 --> 00:16:01.640\nI click it.\n\n284\n00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.790\nNotice that now as Lance,\nI can see Joey's calendar over here,\n\n285\n00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:13.200\nand in my shared calendars it comes over\ninto, sorry, it comes over into Joey.\n\n286\n00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.790\nRemember Lance always also\ncontrols Justin Timberlake, so\n\n287\n00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.840\nthat's why you have that down there,\nas well.\n\n288\n00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.860\nPerfect, so that's how you can start\nsharing calendars out with each other.\n\n289\n00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.620\n&gt;&gt; Now, Von is there a way that\nyou can publish calendars as well?\n\n290\n00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:26.900\nI know sometimes we need to do that.\n\n291\n00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.654\nCan you show us an example of how\nwe would do something like that?\n\n292\n00:16:29.654 --> 00:16:34.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is where, if we're all\non Outlook, that's great, right?\n\n293\n00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.800\nWe can go ahead and\nshare each other's calendar.\n\n294\n00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.730\nBut what if I am not on Outlook, or\n\n295\n00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:43.250\nI am sending it to somebody who is\nnot in that particular environment?\n\n296\n00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.050\nSo this is like another level of sharing.\n\n297\n00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:49.054\nYou are putting this\nout into the Internet.\n\n298\n00:16:49.054 --> 00:16:54.530\nAnd that as long as you have a URL,\nyou will be able to access that calendar.\n\n299\n00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:58.760\nAnd then you can go ahead and give the\nsame permissions as I'm doing right here.\n\n300\n00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.180\nSo yes, you can totally publish it.\n\n301\n00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.810\nLet's jump over back over to Joey.\n\n302\n00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:02.750\nAnd you know what?\n\n303\n00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.774\nActually before I get into the publishing,\n\n304\n00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:06.752\nI do wanna do one last\npart on that sharing.\n\n305\n00:17:06.752 --> 00:17:11.770\nCuz it all kinda ties together of\nthose permission levels, right?\n\n306\n00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:16.830\nBecause what if I wanted Lance\nto be able to see the private\n\n307\n00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:21.290\nmeetings that I have, or\nbe able to create meetings for me?\n\n308\n00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:25.470\nI've shared out the calendar with him, but\nnow I need to give him even more access.\n\n309\n00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.230\nAs Joey to Lance.\n\n310\n00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.574\nYou can right click on your Calendar,\n\n311\n00:17:30.574 --> 00:17:33.062\ncuz that's where we get the properties\ninformation for everything.\n\n312\n00:17:33.062 --> 00:17:36.060\nWe've done this in Contacts,\nwe've also done it in E-mails.\n\n313\n00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.690\nSo we go over to the properties\nof this particular calendar.\n\n314\n00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:40.959\nWe come over to the Permissions tab.\n\n315\n00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:46.090\nAnd as a permissions,\nnotice that Lance right here.\n\n316\n00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.980\nThat's that part where when\nI shared the calendar,\n\n317\n00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.956\nit created this permission level.\n\n318\n00:17:50.956 --> 00:17:55.110\nBut it's just showing that he\ncan read the free and busy time.\n\n319\n00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:56.060\nAnd the folder is visible,\n\n320\n00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.720\ncuz that was one of those things we\ntalked about with delegating authority.\n\n321\n00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.820\nSo this was all done for us.\n\n322\n00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:06.479\nBut maybe, I need him to be able to\nsee more, I need him to be able edit.\n\n323\n00:18:06.479 --> 00:18:12.440\nSo this is where I can have him be able to\ncreate items, I could have him edit items.\n\n324\n00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:16.419\nThen there's also different\npermission levels that will give them\n\n325\n00:18:16.419 --> 00:18:19.360\nall as authoring levels or\neditor letters [LAUGH].\n\n326\n00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.920\nYou'll notice that the little buttons\nstart edit all, create items,\n\n327\n00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.150\nfolder visible, delete.\n\n328\n00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:31.820\nOther free busy options, this is\nwhere they can publish to a location.\n\n329\n00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.675\nI don't wanna necessarily\nget into this part with him.\n\n330\n00:18:35.675 --> 00:18:40.950\nBut this is where you can go ahead,\nand give them more options to.\n\n331\n00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:43.200\nThat's just the properties of Lance, so\n\n332\n00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:48.430\nthat's where I can give him all of\nthose different levels of items.\n\n333\n00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:52.053\nSo, if I wanted to,\nI'm gonna just go ahead and go back to,\n\n334\n00:18:52.053 --> 00:18:54.159\nhe's just going to be a reviewer.\n\n335\n00:18:54.159 --> 00:18:57.297\nHe can see the location and\nthat's about it.\n\n336\n00:18:57.297 --> 00:19:01.010\nAnd he can not delete any items, perfect.\n\n337\n00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.773\nSo that's where I wanted to see that.\n\n338\n00:19:03.773 --> 00:19:04.927\nIn the private level,\n\n339\n00:19:04.927 --> 00:19:08.480\nthat's where if you want to have\nthem be able to get everything.\n\n340\n00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.290\nCuz you notice there was, I was often,\nI was actually kind of searching for\n\n341\n00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:12.300\nlike the private.\n\n342\n00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.526\nI remember, it's in a different place.\n\n343\n00:19:13.526 --> 00:19:16.991\nSo, if you want them to be\nable to access everything,\n\n344\n00:19:16.991 --> 00:19:20.770\nyou're wanna going to grant\nthem access to your account.\n\n345\n00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.254\nAnd that was back over into\nthe sharing of multiple accounts,\n\n346\n00:19:24.254 --> 00:19:26.335\njust a quick little part light here.\n\n347\n00:19:26.335 --> 00:19:30.822\nThe delegate access is here, and\nthat's where I can go ahead and\n\n348\n00:19:30.822 --> 00:19:33.185\ngive them access to my calendar.\n\n349\n00:19:33.185 --> 00:19:35.370\nMaybe not even Email, but\njust a Calendar, and and\n\n350\n00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:40.060\nthat's where you can set even more\npermissions of seeing the private details.\n\n351\n00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.050\nSo, definitely double check that.\n\n352\n00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:45.350\nSo, two different types of sharing.\n\n353\n00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:50.030\nJust the calendar versus\naccess to everything.\n\n354\n00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:53.570\nMail, and our calendars, and our task,\nall of those different parts,\n\n355\n00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:54.790\nso check that episode out.\n\n356\n00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:56.430\nSo back to your question, Rus.\n\n357\n00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.670\nYou talked about publishing calendars?\n\n358\n00:19:58.670 --> 00:19:59.390\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n359\n00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:05.150\nYes, so here in Joey, what if I wanted to\npublish this calendar as a sharable link?\n\n360\n00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.761\nI come over here to Publish, and\nI go to Publish This Calendar.\n\n361\n00:20:08.761 --> 00:20:10.363\nSo make sure you're on the Calendar,\n\n362\n00:20:10.363 --> 00:20:13.150\nbecause if I was going to\npublish the dog's calendar.\n\n363\n00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.500\nYou've got to make sure\non the one that you need.\n\n364\n00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:20.852\nWe go over here to Publish This Calendar,\nit will automatically take you\n\n365\n00:20:20.852 --> 00:20:26.570\nto your account online, your Office\n365 admin center, if you wanna say.\n\n366\n00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:28.840\nSo that's gonna happen automatically.\n\n367\n00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.950\nI'm going to go ahead and login as Joey,\nand it's going to send me right in to\n\n368\n00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.970\nthe Calendar publishing settings, because\nI had clicked on that button from Outlook.\n\n369\n00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:41.730\nSo what calendar am I going to do?\n\n370\n00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:45.210\nNotice this is where hey, if you were on\nthe dog calendar, and you realize no,\n\n371\n00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.500\nI didn't wanna share that one out.\n\n372\n00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.787\nYou can pick the one you wanted.\n\n373\n00:20:47.787 --> 00:20:50.077\nSo I'm going to pick the Calendar.\n\n374\n00:20:50.077 --> 00:20:53.285\nAnd then, select Permissions.\n\n375\n00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:57.175\nThis is back to where we had done\nwith that sharing to Joey's account.\n\n376\n00:20:57.175 --> 00:21:02.435\nDo I want to do the availability only,\nlimited details, full details.\n\n377\n00:21:02.435 --> 00:21:04.575\nMaybe I'll go with limited for\nthis example.\n\n378\n00:21:05.575 --> 00:21:06.525\nI like that.\n\n379\n00:21:06.525 --> 00:21:09.979\nI click save As soon as i\nsave this right down here,\n\n380\n00:21:09.979 --> 00:21:12.875\nnotice there are two different formats.\n\n381\n00:21:12.875 --> 00:21:17.140\nYou can send this as an HTML format or\nan ICS.\n\n382\n00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:21.235\nThis is that ICAL,\nthat universal language,\n\n383\n00:21:21.235 --> 00:21:25.860\nif you wanna say,\nof sharing out that information.\n\n384\n00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:30.644\nSo if I go ahead and [COUGH] excuse me,\nif I'll click on this,\n\n385\n00:21:30.644 --> 00:21:34.890\nit will take me out to that\nparticular web address.\n\n386\n00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.000\nThere's a long, long one.\n\n387\n00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.665\nSo this is what I would be able to send,\nthis URL.\n\n388\n00:21:40.665 --> 00:21:45.871\nI could copy this,\nI could then send that in an email,\n\n389\n00:21:45.871 --> 00:21:49.009\nI could put it in a chat in Skype.\n\n390\n00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:55.710\nIt is now a website that you can send to\npeople, and have them be able to see this.\n\n391\n00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.370\nThey can't change anything about it, but\n\n392\n00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:01.360\nthis is where it's\nthe next level of sharing.\n\n393\n00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:06.035\nIt's sharing like really out there\n[LAUGH], so you could go ahead and\n\n394\n00:22:06.035 --> 00:22:07.110\npublish that.\n\n395\n00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:10.445\nMaybe you realized, all right,\nI thought that was great,\n\n396\n00:22:10.445 --> 00:22:14.530\nbecause I was working with a lot of\ndifferent people on this one project.\n\n397\n00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.126\nAnd now the project is over, and\n\n398\n00:22:16.126 --> 00:22:18.920\nI don't really want people\nto see that anymore, okay.\n\n399\n00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.335\nThe same way that we\nhad got back into this.\n\n400\n00:22:21.335 --> 00:22:25.736\nSo say you've close everything down you\ncan go back to Publish Calendar, or\n\n401\n00:22:25.736 --> 00:22:28.710\nto be able to get into\nthis from your Office 365.\n\n402\n00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.890\nI think is just easier to click\nthe button again back in Outlook.\n\n403\n00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.778\nBecause, this is kind of down into here.\n\n404\n00:22:34.778 --> 00:22:36.480\nBut you could always come\ninto your Office 365,\n\n405\n00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.530\ndo a search, search is awesome,\nand get into here.\n\n406\n00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:44.600\nI don´t want that calendar\nto be published anymore.\n\n407\n00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.670\nAll you have to do is just change\nyour permission to Not Shared.\n\n408\n00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.643\nAs soon as you click Not Shared and\nclick Save,\n\n409\n00:22:50.643 --> 00:22:53.247\nnotice the URL doesn't exist anymore.\n\n410\n00:22:53.247 --> 00:22:59.220\nSo say somebody you gave that URL to\nsomebody, maybe a month or two ago.\n\n411\n00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.984\nAnd they still have it, maybe they've\nbookmarked it, or what have you,\n\n412\n00:23:01.984 --> 00:23:04.008\nonce you change the permission,\nit doesn't exist.\n\n413\n00:23:04.008 --> 00:23:08.090\nThey're gonna get a website not found,\nor some type of 404.\n\n414\n00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:13.110\nSome type of error that says like,\nhey, this just doesn't exist anymore.\n\n415\n00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.570\nSo, it's all gone [LAUGH].\n\n416\n00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:18.810\nSo it's nice to like,\nit's great to know how to share, but hey,\n\n417\n00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:21.260\nI wanna dial that back a little bit.\n\n418\n00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:21.904\nI don't want that to happen.\nAnd\n\n419\n00:23:21.904 --> 00:23:25.730\none other thing just talking\nalong that same line.\n\n420\n00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:30.098\nif I'm back over here as Joey,\nand I don't want to share out my\n\n421\n00:23:30.098 --> 00:23:34.976\ncalendar with Lance anymore,\nyou can go in to the permissions here.\n\n422\n00:23:34.976 --> 00:23:38.600\nJust like we had modified them\nto give more permissions,\n\n423\n00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:43.590\nyou can also remove the permissions\nfrom somebody else's calendar or inbox.\n\n424\n00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:48.561\nJust always go into the properties\nof that particular folder,\n\n425\n00:23:48.561 --> 00:23:51.200\nwhether it be email or calendar.\n\n426\n00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.890\nAnd make sure you take off the people\nthat you don't want to have access to.\n\n427\n00:23:55.890 --> 00:24:01.080\nBecause, things happen, and\nthere's different reasons why you want\n\n428\n00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.540\nto share at one time, and\nthen not share it another.\n\n429\n00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.960\nSo just remember,\n\n430\n00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:11.020\nI forgot that I still have that delegate\naccess from JT to everybody else.\n\n431\n00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:15.710\nSo that's how you can go ahead and\nstart removing permissions.\n\n432\n00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:20.480\nNow, Wes, I can see you looking at me\nover there in the corner like, hey.\n\n433\n00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:24.660\nI think we're getting towards the end,\nand I do have more things to talk about.\n\n434\n00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.590\nBecause we did talk about sharing,\nbut what about transferring?\n\n435\n00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:29.450\nWhat about importing and exporting?\n\n436\n00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:31.620\nI wanna at least go ahead and\ncover those, so\n\n437\n00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.970\nI think that we're gonna need a part two.\n\n438\n00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:35.320\n&gt;&gt; Hey, well that sounds good.\n\n439\n00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.130\nWe can always make one\nshow that much better.\n\n440\n00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:42.538\nBecause it is, as Vonne says, we\nare coming to the end of another episode.\n\n441\n00:24:42.538 --> 00:24:45.480\nBut before we do Von,\ndo you have any final words?\n\n442\n00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.180\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nleave them with a cliffhanger, and\n\n443\n00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.030\nwe'll just say,\nyou'll have to see it in part two.\n\n444\n00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:51.000\n&gt;&gt; Come back for more [LAUGH].\n\n445\n00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.061\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, Von, as always we\nappreciate having you here in the studios,\n\n446\n00:24:54.061 --> 00:24:56.111\nand we appreciate having\nyou the viewer watch it.\n\n447\n00:24:56.111 --> 00:24:57.438\nNow, if you haven't been seeing some\n\n448\n00:24:57.438 --> 00:24:59.210\nof the other shows that\nwe have in OfficePro.TV.\n\n449\n00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:01.020\nCheck them out, because remember,\n\n450\n00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.270\nwe're gonna help you accelerate\nyour productivity in the workplace.\n\n451\n00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:05.410\nAnd I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n452\n00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:06.620\n&gt;&gt; I'm Von

00:00:09.720\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.350\nAnd we got a great episode for you today.\n\n5\n00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.290\nIn fact we're coming back with a part two\non sharing and transferring calendars,\n\n6\n00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.810\nand joining us back in the studios\nis none other than Mrs. Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.160\nHow are we doing today Vonne?\n\n8\n00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.660\n&gt;&gt; I'm good.\n\n9\n00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.988\nWe're continuing on just like you said,\n[LAUGH].\n\n10\n00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:24.429\nWe're trudging forward.\n\n11\n00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.284\nI don't know if trudging is\nthe right word for this one.\n\n12\n00:00:26.284 --> 00:00:26.889\n&gt;&gt; That's okay,\n\n13\n00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:30.018\nI always tells them we'll make our own\ncontributions in the English language.\n\n14\n00:00:30.018 --> 00:00:31.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly, [LAUGH].\n\n15\n00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.610\nYeah so, we're gonna keep on moving,\nbecause we didn't get into the exporting\n\n16\n00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.400\nand importing of your calendars\nbecause things changed.\n\n17\n00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.750\nYou change positions, you change accounts.\n\n18\n00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.185\nYou were using Google for\nthe longest time and Gmail, but\n\n19\n00:00:45.185 --> 00:00:47.937\nnow you're at an organization\nthat now you're using Outlook.\n\n20\n00:00:47.937 --> 00:00:50.949\nAnd you're like, hey, I wanna just\njump on that Outlook bandwagon,\n\n21\n00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.131\nbecause it's so awesome.\n\n22\n00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:57.590\nAnd so I need to bring everything over\nfrom my Google account into Outlook.\n\n23\n00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.495\nSo those are some scenarios\nthat we are going to go over.\n\n24\n00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:03.300\nI do have some references in the show\nnotes, so make sure to go ahead and\n\n25\n00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.929\nlook at those.\n\n26\n00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:05.695\nThere's some really good ones,\n\n27\n00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:09.111\nbecause these are all very common\nthings that happen to people.\n\n28\n00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:13.413\nYou're with one type of platform\nthen you move over to the other, and\n\n29\n00:01:13.413 --> 00:01:18.850\nthe support information on the website of\nMicrosoft's help files are really great.\n\n30\n00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.500\nLet me go ahead and\nshow you a few of them down here.\n\n31\n00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.340\nI'm in Joeys machine, and so\n\n32\n00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.630\nwe have the Share an Outlook\ncalendar with other people.\n\n33\n00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.110\nThat was all the things that\nwe had done in the part one.\n\n34\n00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.840\nSo it does go ahead and\nshow you how to share,\n\n35\n00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.070\nchange permissions,\npublishing it to a web page.\n\n36\n00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.530\nThose are all the things that we have\nalready gone over in our part one.\n\n37\n00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.640\nThe other tabs that I have across here,\n\n38\n00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.410\nexport an Outlook calendar\nto Google calendar.\n\n39\n00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.830\nThat sounds like what a lot\nof people need to do,\n\n40\n00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.580\nor import a Google calendar to Outlook.\n\n41\n00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.660\nAnd then there's another one that\nwe're going to test, or go ahead and\n\n42\n00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.030\nhit on is the show your\nGoogle calendar and Outlook.\n\n43\n00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.630\nNow this isn't an import, export.\n\n44\n00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.220\nThis is more of a,\nhey I still have two calendars and I do.\n\n45\n00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.250\nI have my Gmail calendar,\nor my Google calendar.\n\n46\n00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.890\nAnd that's really more for\nme, my personal stuff.\n\n47\n00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.260\nAnd I have my Outlook here at work.\n\n48\n00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.420\nAnd I go ahead and use Outlook.\n\n49\n00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.750\nBut maybe I wanna be able to see it all.\n\n50\n00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.760\nThat doesn't mean I can change\nthings on my Google calendar, but\n\n51\n00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.430\nit's just bringing it in here.\n\n52\n00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.110\nSo it has the information on this\nwebsite of how you can do this.\n\n53\n00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.010\nAnd so I'll show you the end result,\nbut these steps that are right here.\n\n54\n00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.090\nThey're the ones that I used and\nit worked, so you can use it too.\n\n55\n00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.110\nSo importing, exporting.\n\n56\n00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.740\nOnce you get, it's really kind of\neverything you're kind of taking out.\n\n57\n00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.425\nNo, wait where am I?\n\n58\n00:02:40.425 --> 00:02:46.060\n[LAUGH] If Outlook is the place that\nI am exporting, cuz I want to then\n\n59\n00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.740\ntransfer to Google, you're gonna have to\ntake this and export it out as a file.\n\n60\n00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.640\nJust like we had talked about exporting\nout your contacts as to a CSV file.\n\n61\n00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.170\nHere you're going to go ahead and\n\n62\n00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.600\nexport these out as an iCal or that CV-\n&gt;&gt; ICS?\n\n63\n00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.435\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, something like that,\nsome letters out there,\n\n64\n00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:09.370\n[LAUGH] to a particular file format\nthat everybody can go ahead and see.\n\n65\n00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Vonne, so you mentioned exporting\nyour contacts out to a CSV file.\n\n66\n00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.060\nAre we looking at something that like?\n\n67\n00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.498\nIs the process is gonna be the same there?\n\n68\n00:03:15.498 --> 00:03:17.243\n&gt;&gt; Almost, [LAUGH].\n\n69\n00:03:17.243 --> 00:03:21.255\nYour still going over to the file tab and\nyou're going out,\n\n70\n00:03:21.255 --> 00:03:24.878\nbut you're not gonna do the import or\nopen an export.\n\n71\n00:03:24.878 --> 00:03:30.190\nIt's the save calendar, so\nit's close but not [LAUGH].\n\n72\n00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.467\nLet me show you.\nSo let's come back to here,\n\n73\n00:03:32.467 --> 00:03:37.572\nI've got the calendar that I want to save\nout, cuz I'm transferring that over.\n\n74\n00:03:37.572 --> 00:03:42.197\nI come over here to my file tab, this is\nwhere you would think you were going,\n\n75\n00:03:42.197 --> 00:03:46.360\nbecause that's where we go to\nour exporting out our contacts.\n\n76\n00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.730\nNow when we're exporting our calendar,\nyou actually go to Save Calendar.\n\n77\n00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.800\nAnd your like, okay well I'm\nsaving just this one calendar.\n\n78\n00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.061\nAnd it is in that iCalander format,\nthat format that we've been talking about,\n\n79\n00:03:59.061 --> 00:04:00.385\nbut I wanna get all of it.\n\n80\n00:04:00.385 --> 00:04:03.143\nYou have to go into your more options,\nso that were,\n\n81\n00:04:03.143 --> 00:04:06.603\nback in those references that I gave you,\nthis is on those steps.\n\n82\n00:04:06.603 --> 00:04:10.187\nSo you go to more options And\nwhat is the date range?\n\n83\n00:04:10.187 --> 00:04:14.290\nNow this is where do I wanna go ahead and\ndo the next seven days?\n\n84\n00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.235\nThe next 30 days?\n\n85\n00:04:15.235 --> 00:04:17.490\nBut I want the whole calendar,\n\n86\n00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:22.420\nbecause if I was moving all over into\nGoogle and not using Outlook anymore,\n\n87\n00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:28.110\nI'd probably want the whole thing, or\nmaybe like from now until whenever.\n\n88\n00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.100\nSo you could specify the dates or have the\nones that they have as like the next 30,\n\n89\n00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.280\nthe next seven.\n\n90\n00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.510\nSo when does it start?\n\n91\n00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.720\nWhen does it end?\n\n92\n00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.070\nWhat do I want to go ahead and give out,\nso I can go over into that full details.\n\n93\n00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.811\nYou could also come into the advanced,\nand you could see that right there.\n\n94\n00:04:44.811 --> 00:04:47.297\nInclude details of items marked private.\n\n95\n00:04:47.297 --> 00:04:51.037\nThat would be like if you were the owner\nof the calendar going into another\n\n96\n00:04:51.037 --> 00:04:52.000\naccount.\n\n97\n00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.820\nYou could do this, but of course if you\nwere exporting this out to somebody else\n\n98\n00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.600\nfor them to be able to see in that format.\n\n99\n00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.570\nRather than, the sharing of the calendars\nor the publish options that we did.\n\n100\n00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.620\nYou're actually just giving\nthem the whole file for\n\n101\n00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.930\nthem to be able to do\nwhat they need with it.\n\n102\n00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.880\nYou might not wanna include these two\ndifferent things, or include attachments\n\n103\n00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.830\nwithin calendar items, because you could\nalways attach them into the notes.\n\n104\n00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.860\nSo those are your options\nthat you would want to do.\n\n105\n00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.899\nLet´s go ahead and\ndo just the next three days for now, and\n\n106\n00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:26.146\nwe will do full details and\nI will click OK.\n\n107\n00:05:26.146 --> 00:05:29.980\nI'll put this out on the desktop and\nI'll click Save.\n\n108\n00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.991\nSo now that file is saved as\nthat iCal format right here, and\n\n109\n00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:41.204\nyou could see this would be the file that\nI would transfer to a share drive or\n\n110\n00:05:41.204 --> 00:05:46.515\nput up on your Google drive, or\nwherever you would need to go and\n\n111\n00:05:46.515 --> 00:05:49.347\nbe able to import it into Google.\n\n112\n00:05:49.347 --> 00:05:51.041\nI've already kind of hinted on that,\nlike all right.\n\n113\n00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:55.522\nWell now you can get stuff out,\nwhat about bringing stuff in?\n\n114\n00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:59.806\nMaybe you are coming from\nGoogle into Outlook, and\n\n115\n00:05:59.806 --> 00:06:02.803\nyou need to bring your calendar in.\n\n116\n00:06:02.803 --> 00:06:07.230\nWell the first step would be in Google,\nyou'd have to export it out.\n\n117\n00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.770\nAnd then now you'd have to import it in,\nokay so there's both sides.\n\n118\n00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.710\nYou've gotta kind of get each one.\n\n119\n00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.780\nAnd those steps in the references\nlike I said will do it.\n\n120\n00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.010\nSo if I'm here in Outlook I\nneed to bring in a calendar.\n\n121\n00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.010\nThis is where you do go to open and\nexport.\n\n122\n00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.020\nYou would come into the import and export.\n\n123\n00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.370\nI am going to import this here.\n\n124\n00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.460\nIt's not gonna be another program or file,\nbecause it actually has right there import\n\n125\n00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:40.900\nan iCalendar, the ICS or\nthe VCS file format.\n\n126\n00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:47.630\nAnd this is where you would go out and\nfind that exported Google calendar format.\n\n127\n00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.550\nFind the file that you want,\nclick open, go to the next steps.\n\n128\n00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.091\nI'm not going to complete this, cuz I\ndon't want it to mess up the rest of my\n\n129\n00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:58.740\ncalendar and everything is, I don't\nneed to import a calendar right now.\n\n130\n00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.890\nBut those would be the steps that you\nwould need to do to import calendar in.\n\n131\n00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.287\nLast thing,\nthat showing of your Google Calendar.\n\n132\n00:07:08.287 --> 00:07:13.935\nOver here in Lance's account,\nI have already done the steps for\n\n133\n00:07:13.935 --> 00:07:18.340\nthat and\nnotice it has Chris's Google Calendar.\n\n134\n00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:25.522\nSo I can see this and I have Chris,\nbecause pretend this is Lance's calendar.\n\n135\n00:07:25.522 --> 00:07:28.860\nBut the only Gmail account I\nhave created is for Chris.\n\n136\n00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.410\nAnd so\nI could see the calendar right along side.\n\n137\n00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.410\nI can see all the appointments.\n\n138\n00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.120\nIf I try to open them.\n\n139\n00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.580\nOkay, well there's lunch with JC.\n\n140\n00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:42.705\nNow if I try to make a change,\nit's going to not let me change this.\n\n141\n00:07:42.705 --> 00:07:44.257\nSo if you're like, I could get into it.\n\n142\n00:07:44.257 --> 00:07:46.350\nWell yeah,\nthat's cuz you can see the details.\n\n143\n00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:50.750\nBut you can't make any changes,\nbecause it is a read only folder.\n\n144\n00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.570\nSo that way you can at least,\nI don't need to save my changes,\n\n145\n00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.250\ncuz I can't make changes.\n\n146\n00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.570\nAnd so you can see those,\nthat calendar right next to you.\n\n147\n00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.508\nAnd this is Google Calendar,\nthat's wonderful.\n\n148\n00:08:02.508 --> 00:08:06.950\nI just want to jump back over to Joey\nto give you that reference here,\n\n149\n00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:11.620\nis that you do have to subscribe\nto your Google Calendar.\n\n150\n00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:16.630\nSo that's where, you have to do this\nsetting in your Google Calendar\n\n151\n00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:21.600\nto set up that I am going to under\na private address click this button.\n\n152\n00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.280\nGet that shortcut, notice that note,\n\n153\n00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.330\nit says don't click it, make sure\nyou right click on it to copy it.\n\n154\n00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:32.540\nAnd then in Outlook, you're gonna\ncome into your account settings.\n\n155\n00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:39.533\nGo on the Internet Calendar tab,\nclick New, and then paste that address in.\n\n156\n00:08:39.533 --> 00:08:44.613\nAnd so that is what, no this is Joey.\n\n157\n00:08:44.613 --> 00:08:51.183\n[LAUGH] Back over here, this is\nwhere Lance in his account settings.\n\n158\n00:08:51.183 --> 00:08:55.914\nIn the Internet Calendars,\nthere's that address that I had\n\n159\n00:08:55.914 --> 00:09:00.657\ngotten from Chris's,\nthat is the totally wrong computer.\n\n160\n00:09:00.657 --> 00:09:04.553\n[LAUGH] Okay, sorry guys.\n\n161\n00:09:04.553 --> 00:09:07.665\nI'm giving you a little,\nthere you go, there´s Lance.\n\n162\n00:09:07.665 --> 00:09:08.525\nThere we go.\n\n163\n00:09:08.525 --> 00:09:10.015\nSo in his calendar,\n\n164\n00:09:10.015 --> 00:09:14.660\nthis is Chris's calandar,\nwe are all over the map today, aren't we?\n\n165\n00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.890\nI went ahead and made those adjustments.\n\n166\n00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.700\nSo if I made any changes\nin the Google Calendar,\n\n167\n00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.890\nit would then update in the view\nof my Outlook Calendar.\n\n168\n00:09:27.105 --> 00:09:29.785\nSorry, I took you on a couple of trips\naround there to all of these different\n\n169\n00:09:29.785 --> 00:09:31.445\nmachines that I have going on.\n\n170\n00:09:31.445 --> 00:09:34.995\nBut that does cover all of the other\nthings that I wanted to show you about\n\n171\n00:09:34.995 --> 00:09:39.037\nthe importing, the exporting,\nespecially from the Google to Outlook,\n\n172\n00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:40.520\ncuz that's a big thing.\n\n173\n00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.350\nAnd then of course seeing your\nGoogle calendar within Outlook.\n\n174\n00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.430\n&gt;&gt; Well I think you did a great job,\n\n175\n00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.191\ncuz I have a hard time\ntracking just my own calendar.\n\n176\n00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:49.485\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let alone 4 or 5 of them.\n\n177\n00:09:49.485 --> 00:09:52.855\nVonne we appreciate you taking the time to\njust kind of tie off the loose ends here\n\n178\n00:09:52.855 --> 00:09:56.025\nwe have when it comes to sharing and\ntransferring contacts, but contact,\n\n179\n00:09:56.025 --> 00:09:58.213\nexcuse me calendars,\nthat was the other episode.\n\n180\n00:09:58.213 --> 00:09:59.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n181\n00:09:59.020 --> 00:09:59.808\n&gt;&gt; That's right, but\n\n182\n00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:02.632\nbefore we sign out do you have any final\nwords when it comes to just working\n\n183\n00:10:02.632 --> 00:10:04.643\nwith the calendars between\ndifferent platforms.\n\n184\n00:10:04.643 --> 00:10:08.468\n&gt;&gt; Just always make and sure you know\nwhich swiping your doing on your Mac to\n\n185\n00:10:08.468 --> 00:10:11.275\nknow which virtual machine\nyou're going into, and\n\n186\n00:10:11.275 --> 00:10:13.398\nwhat account that you need to control.\n\n187\n00:10:13.398 --> 00:10:14.519\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n188\n00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:17.748\nWell, Vonne, as always we appreciate\nyou being here with us and sharing and\n\n189\n00:10:17.748 --> 00:10:19.320\nlending your expertise in Outlook.\n\n190\n00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.620\nAnd we

you're joining us today.\n\n4\n00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.890\nWe got a great episode for you.\n\n5\n00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.390\nI'm your show host Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.000\nIn today's episode, we're going to\nbe looking at more Outlook 2016.\n\n7\n00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.035\nAnd joining us back in the studios\nis none other than Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:18.035 --> 00:00:19.250\nVonne, how you doing today?\n\n9\n00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.400\nI'm fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.820\nSo, Wes I have a task for you.\n\n11\n00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.140\nNo, goodness.\n\n12\n00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.340\nIs to keep me in check.\n\n13\n00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.845\nOkay.\n\n14\n00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:27.810\n[LAUGH] Deal.\n\n15\n00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.480\nAwesome.\n\n16\n00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.260\nWell, then I can mark you as complete.\n\n17\n00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.050\nBecause today,\nwe're going to be talking all about tasks.\n\n18\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.210\nDid you see what I did there?\n\n19\n00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.390\nI seen that, I seen that.\n\n20\n00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.880\nYeah.\nSo, we're gonna be talking about tasks and\n\n21\n00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.230\nalso notes.\n\n22\n00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.760\nSo that the two, I guess, last areas\nof Outlook that we haven't covered,\n\n23\n00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.710\nagain, if you're watching in succession.\n\n24\n00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.248\nSo Outlook is great for\nemailing and for calendars and\n\n25\n00:00:50.248 --> 00:00:54.579\ncontact, but you can also go ahead and\ncreate your own to do list.\n\n26\n00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.590\nAnd be able to track how much you have\ncompleted, what you haven't completed.\n\n27\n00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.943\nYou could assign tasks to others just\nlike I assigned the task to Wesk, Wesk.\n\n28\n00:01:02.943 --> 00:01:04.191\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n29\n00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:07.300\n[LAUGH] Adding those keys\neverywhere around here.\n\n30\n00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.090\nSo I could go ahead and\n\n31\n00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.250\nassign that task to Wes and\nhave him go ahead and complete it.\n\n32\n00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.520\nAnd then, have him give me\nstatus reports on his progress.\n\n33\n00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.190\nSo, all of those different things\nyou can do within Outlook.\n\n34\n00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.680\nAnd then notes, notes are just like\nnotes that you write for yourself.\n\n35\n00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.380\nAnd you could go ahead and\n\n36\n00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.490\nput a little sticky note on your monitor,\nI´m kind of notorious for doing that, and\n\n37\n00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.840\nall my different colors and everything,\nthey´re like electronic sticky notes.\n\n38\n00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.460\nThey´re really just for\nyou to have some notes.\n\n39\n00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.870\nNow, there is a whole\nproduct called OneNote,\n\n40\n00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.150\nwhich is pretty fantastic\nI will let you say.\n\n41\n00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.490\nI will let you say?\n\n42\n00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.870\nI will let you know, and I will say to\nyou, but that´s a whole other show and\n\n43\n00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.560\na whole other topic that I really wanna\ngo ahead and film a whole series on that.\n\n44\n00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.032\nSo stay tuned and hopefully look for\nit in your library.\n\n45\n00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:59.590\nSo let's go ahead and\nget down into Joey's machine here.\n\n46\n00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.950\nWe've got his email open.\n\n47\n00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.310\nAnd so\nI need to get to the task area of Outlook.\n\n48\n00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.420\nDown here in our Navigation Pane,\nthat's where we can get to our tasks.\n\n49\n00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.570\nWe've been through our calendar and\nour contacts.\n\n50\n00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.570\nThe little checkbox little list looking\nthing, that's your to-do list, your tasks.\n\n51\n00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.740\nAnd just like any other area of Outlook,\n\n52\n00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.370\nyou can start changing the views\nof what you're looking at.\n\n53\n00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.440\nRight now,\nthis is in I think the to-do list view.\n\n54\n00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.000\nI believe so,\nit does say to do list up at the top so\n\n55\n00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.600\nI´m pretty sure that´s what it is.\n\n56\n00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.287\nWhere we´ve been going in all of our\ndifferent areas, to change our views,\n\n57\n00:02:37.287 --> 00:02:38.960\nwe go over to our view tab.\n\n58\n00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.940\nAnd in this view tab we have the different\ntypes of created, ready to go views here.\n\n59\n00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.390\nThere´s quite a few of them here.\n\n60\n00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.250\nA little bit more than we have seen\nin our other areas with details,\n\n61\n00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.600\nsimple lists, priorities.\n\n62\n00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.680\nRemember, this is your tasks list.\n\n63\n00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.740\nWhat am I supposed to do?\n\n64\n00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.660\nWhat am I supposed to give myself,\nlike reminders of my daily chores?\n\n65\n00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.610\nNow, how is this different\nfrom appointments?\n\n66\n00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.426\nYou might be asking yourself that.\n\n67\n00:03:05.426 --> 00:03:07.281\nWell, not much.\n\n68\n00:03:07.281 --> 00:03:09.810\n[LAUGHS] I guess they´re really\njust in two different areas.\n\n69\n00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.649\nIt´s really how you want\nto organize yourself.\n\n70\n00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.456\nYour appointments they go in a calendar.\n\n71\n00:03:17.456 --> 00:03:19.500\nSo, you're going to see\nit within your calendar.\n\n72\n00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.693\nYour tasks is really just a to do list,\nand it can be prioritized or\n\n73\n00:03:23.693 --> 00:03:28.134\norganized with end dates,\nbecause you can give yourself due dates.\n\n74\n00:03:28.134 --> 00:03:31.956\nSo, it's really just how you want to put\nwhat you need to do to keep yourself\n\n75\n00:03:31.956 --> 00:03:32.630\norganized.\n\n76\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.840\nI like to do something like here,\nwhat are the plants for next week?\n\n77\n00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.433\nPlan JC's surprise party.\n\n78\n00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:43.693\nI mean that's no necessarily\nan appointment that I need to go to be at\n\n79\n00:03:43.693 --> 00:03:48.028\nsomewhere, it's just something\nthat I need to write down of, hey,\n\n80\n00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:49.854\nlet's go ahead and do this.\n\n81\n00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:52.840\nI'm gonna go ahead and put some\nnotes in with this particular thing.\n\n82\n00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.240\nAnd let me track my progress.\n\n83\n00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.095\nThat's where you would maybe\nput your stuff in tasks.\n\n84\n00:03:57.095 --> 00:04:01.335\nBut I can see where the line of what\nshould I put as an appointment and\n\n85\n00:04:01.335 --> 00:04:05.750\nwhat should I put as a task it could\nbe a small blur in the middle there.\n\n86\n00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.496\nSo pick and choose which ever\nway you feel most comfortable.\n\n87\n00:04:11.496 --> 00:04:14.660\nSpeaking about most comfortable,\nwhat about our views.\n\n88\n00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.840\nThe to do list right here, it does give\nme the ones that have the little flags.\n\n89\n00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.230\nNow we've covered this in our other\nepisodes when we were doing our email.\n\n90\n00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.385\nWe could flag our emails for followup.\n\n91\n00:04:26.385 --> 00:04:29.144\nAnd that was just like within our emails,\nif it starts three red and\n\n92\n00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:32.540\nit's got that little red flag next to it,\nI know that's an indication to me that,\n\n93\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.890\nhey, this email is important.\n\n94\n00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.560\nYou need to follow up on it.\n\n95\n00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.680\nMaybe I needed to do research some things\nfirst before I respond to that email.\n\n96\n00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.810\nThat goes ahead and gets flagged,\nbut it goes into your to do\n\n97\n00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.420\nlist cuz you're telling yourself hey, you\nneed to follow up on this particular item.\n\n98\n00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.960\nSo that's why we have some of them in\nthis particular list that are more red,\n\n99\n00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.890\nwell I guess they are red.\n\n100\n00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.440\nAnd some that are black because they\ncome from either being flags in email or\n\n101\n00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.960\nan actual task that I created for\nmyself within the tasks area.\n\n102\n00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.730\nYou can see over here there's some\nother icons within this view,\n\n103\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.260\nto where it has a little bell.\n\n104\n00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.770\nThat means it has a reminder on it,\n\n105\n00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.310\njust like we can put\na reminder on our appointment.\n\n106\n00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.640\nThese other icons depend\non whether it came from,\n\n107\n00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.080\nlike this is indicating\nthat this is a meeting.\n\n108\n00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.980\nThis is indicated this is created\nfrom a task, this is really small.\n\n109\n00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.920\nBut you can see that there's one that\nlooks like there's little swirly lines\n\n110\n00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.580\naround it, or swirly arrows that\nmeans it's a reoccurring test,\n\n111\n00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.590\njust like we had recurring appointment.\n\n112\n00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.580\nThe little colored boxes, those are your\ncategories and then our flags are for\n\n113\n00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.800\nour follow-ups.\n\n114\n00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.170\nYou can see that they're\norganized in Today.\n\n115\n00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.150\nNow, why does it say Today?\n\n116\n00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.813\nBecause when you flag an email,\n\n117\n00:05:41.813 --> 00:05:45.680\nyou're not necessarily setting a date\nby when you need to complete it.\n\n118\n00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.772\nIt's just, hey, it's flagged.\n\n119\n00:05:46.772 --> 00:05:53.150\nOnce likw, and if I flag something today,\nit'll turn up tomorrow in Today in red.\n\n120\n00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.220\nSo it's just saying, hey,\ndo this today cuz you haven't done it yet.\n\n121\n00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.380\nSo that's why we have it here.\n\n122\n00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.930\nSo this is within this particular list,\n\n123\n00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.260\nthere is a reading pane over here that if\nI started clicking on them, it will bring\n\n124\n00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.280\nup this email or this particular task\ndepending on what I'm clicking on.\n\n125\n00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.950\nAnd so,\nI have that reading pane over here and\n\n126\n00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.400\nthose same buttons that\nwe've had in every view tab.\n\n127\n00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.200\nThey´re right there too.\n\n128\n00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.398\nComing over to our different\nviews of our tasks,\n\n129\n00:06:19.398 --> 00:06:24.166\nI really like the detailed tab or\nthe detailed view within this view tab.\n\n130\n00:06:24.166 --> 00:06:26.400\nBecause this gives me all sorts of things.\n\n131\n00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.050\nIt´s actually showing me more tasks\nin this list than in the to do list.\n\n132\n00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.065\nIt´s showing me the completed tasks.\n\n133\n00:06:32.065 --> 00:06:36.690\nThe ones that have a strike through,\nwhere it´s crossed out.\n\n134\n00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.540\nKinda like how you physically\nwrite on a paper and cross it off,\n\n135\n00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.410\nit's such a satisfying feeling\nwhen you cross it off,\n\n136\n00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.180\ncause I still write everything\nin paper and pencil.\n\n137\n00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.004\nIn pencil, not pen I don't like pen,\nI like pencils,\n\n138\n00:06:50.004 --> 00:06:54.390\n[LAUGH] so we have these different lists\nand it gives me the different columns.\n\n139\n00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.950\nThat this is sorting by, or\n\n140\n00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.310\nat least being organized by subject,\nor status, the date completed.\n\n141\n00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.170\nAll of these different\ncategories that I could\n\n142\n00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.960\narrange by just like if you had an Excel.\n\n143\n00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.950\nNow, could you add or\nmodify columns that are in that section?\n\n144\n00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.058\nYou totally can, and that's actually\nsomething I like to do because if I'm\n\n145\n00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:17.310\ngonna be assigning tasks to people I would\nlike to see that in one of my columns.\n\n146\n00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.370\nAnd actually, right now,\nI do have some modifications to this.\n\n147\n00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.000\nThe reason I know that there's some\nmodifications to this view is,\n\n148\n00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.300\nyou see that reset view?\n\n149\n00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.581\nIt's allowing me to click the button.\n\n150\n00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:31.143\nAnd it's also, here, let me show you.\n\n151\n00:07:31.143 --> 00:07:32.152\nIf I click it.\n\n152\n00:07:32.152 --> 00:07:36.010\nWas gonna say are you sure you wanna reset\nthe detailed view to the original settings\n\n153\n00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:36.950\nand I click yes.\n\n154\n00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.410\nSee this is actually how\nit would look by default.\n\n155\n00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.065\nI had done some modifications before\nthis kinda playing around, and\n\n156\n00:07:43.065 --> 00:07:45.596\nthat's why it kinda looks\na little different.\n\n157\n00:07:45.596 --> 00:07:48.349\nBut you see now how the reset\nview is not grayed out.\n\n158\n00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:52.891\nThat means that this is the starting point\nof how Outlook determines the detailed\n\n159\n00:07:52.891 --> 00:07:56.522\nview and I've reset it to its\nFactory settings if you wanna say.\n\n160\n00:07:56.522 --> 00:07:58.473\nThat seems like it'd be\na great setting for Wes,\n\n161\n00:07:58.473 --> 00:08:00.580\nbecause I could tell you I\ncould mess up some things.\n\n162\n00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.962\nSo if you hose it up a little bit and\nyou're not liking it,\n\n163\n00:08:02.962 --> 00:08:05.991\ngets a little bit too jumbled, you can\ncome back to more of a basic view and\n\n164\n00:08:05.991 --> 00:08:09.188\nkinda set yourself straight before maybe,\nlike Wes, messing it up again.\n\n165\n00:08:09.188 --> 00:08:12.962\n[LAUGH] Yeah it's great it's like the no,\nno, no, let's start over yes.\n\n166\n00:08:12.962 --> 00:08:19.338\nAnd we've covered all of this in detail in\nour search customized organize and search.\n\n167\n00:08:19.338 --> 00:08:21.120\nI think I switched those around.\n\n168\n00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.666\nIn our email episode or email group, so\n\n169\n00:08:23.666 --> 00:08:28.543\ndefinitely all the same thing apply\nhere but you can start adding columns.\n\n170\n00:08:28.543 --> 00:08:31.270\nOver here there is an add column button.\n\n171\n00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.470\nThere also is the view settings,\nwhere you can go.\n\n172\n00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.940\nYou can start getting really\ncrazy in here about these\n\n173\n00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.590\nadvanced view settings with how you want\nto filter it, how you want to group it.\n\n174\n00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.310\nHow do you want\nthe conditional formatting?\n\n175\n00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:44.810\nWe covered that in\nthe email episode as well.\n\n176\n00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:50.577\nI want all tasks that are assigned to me\nto be bright green and 45 point font.\n\n177\n00:08:50.577 --> 00:08:53.584\nThat would probably be a little overkill,\nbut you could go ahead and\n\n178\n00:08:53.584 --> 00:08:57.200\nchange all those conditional formattings\nin your default formattings.\n\n179\n00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.180\nBut right here you can also\nchange the columns, and\n\n180\n00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.890\nthen add your columns from the available,\nbring them on over here and\n\n181\n00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:10.220\nthen drag them up or move them up in\nthe order to see what you want to do.\n\n182\n00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.370\nI'm gonna go ahead and go the other\nway and click this Add Columns button.\n\n183\n00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.900\nLook, it throws me to\npretty much the same place.\n\n184\n00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.475\nSo well, I just wanted to show you,\nthat's why.\n\n185\n00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:21.420\n[LAUGH] So I could say Assigned To.\n\n186\n00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.260\nI wanna add that column.\n\n187\n00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:30.510\nI want to do the, there's a Status Update\nto where we have requests,\n\n188\n00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:35.020\ncustom status, that's a custom status.\n\n189\n00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.071\nSo is it already over here?\n\n190\n00:09:37.071 --> 00:09:37.900\nMaybe.\n\n191\n00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:43.832\nWell, we could go ahead and\nfind our status update in here.\n\n192\n00:09:43.832 --> 00:09:45.656\nI really want to find this.\n\n193\n00:09:45.656 --> 00:09:49.508\nOkay, we'll go with custom status.\n\n194\n00:09:49.508 --> 00:09:55.000\n[LAUGH] We'll see if that's the one that\ngoing to go through, it's all in here.\n\n195\n00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.900\nModified, date completed,\nall right never mind, we're all good.\n\n196\n00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.530\nWe'll go ahead and move this up, but\nthe point here is you can go ahead and\n\n197\n00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.520\nfind whatever category you\nwant to put into your columns.\n\n198\n00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.430\nYou can move them around, you can also\ncome within this list view and start\n\n199\n00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:14.150\nchanging the column width to the date that\nit's modified, the date it's completed.\n\n200\n00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.742\nYou can move the date completed\nover to the other side, looking for\n\n201\n00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:18.714\nthose red lines.\n\n202\n00:10:18.714 --> 00:10:23.401\nSo you can customize to\nyour heart's content about\n\n203\n00:10:23.401 --> 00:10:28.580\nhow you want to view your\ntasks within this view.\n\n204\n00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.380\nNow I see a couple of tasks\nalready in place for us, but\n\n205\n00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.470\nwe've got the keys to the car.\n\n206\n00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:34.690\nCan we take this for a test drive?\n\n207\n00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.390\nCan you show us how to\ncreate one of these tasks?\n\n208\n00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.725\nDefinitely.\n\n209\n00:10:37.725 --> 00:10:41.909\nWhy don't we go over to our home tab,\nand we'll go with our new task.\n\n210\n00:10:41.909 --> 00:10:43.348\nAre there other ways to do it?\n\n211\n00:10:43.348 --> 00:10:44.184\nWhy, sure.\n\n212\n00:10:44.184 --> 00:10:47.490\nYou could right click over\nin the task area, and\n\n213\n00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.558\nI'm wanting to make my own task for\nmyself.\n\n214\n00:10:50.558 --> 00:10:54.210\nWell, since I've already right clicked,\nlet's go with here.\n\n215\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.610\nNew task and\nthen you start filling it out.\n\n216\n00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:57.780\nWhat is the subject?\n\n217\n00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:02.980\nWell, we need to make\nsure that we order cake,\n\n218\n00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.060\ncuz we seem to always have cake here.\n\n219\n00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.300\nSo we're gonna order cake for Wes.\n\n220\n00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.356\nPerfect.\nYes.\n\n221\n00:11:08.356 --> 00:11:09.971\nI love cake.\n\n222\n00:11:09.971 --> 00:11:14.200\nYes, exactly, and that's why we're\nordering cake, cuz Wes likes cake.\n\n223\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.700\nSo we're gonna order cake for Wes.\n\n224\n00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.148\nNow, when do I want it to start?\n\n225\n00:11:18.148 --> 00:11:21.012\nYou don't necessarily have\nto have a start date,\n\n226\n00:11:21.012 --> 00:11:24.898\ncuz maybe your task is an ongoing\ntask that are, or something that,\n\n227\n00:11:24.898 --> 00:11:28.189\nlike I know it's coming up and\nI know by the end of Friday.\n\n228\n00:11:28.189 --> 00:11:29.164\nSo sorry, I switched.\n\n229\n00:11:29.164 --> 00:11:29.803\nWe're not getting cake today.\n\n230\n00:11:29.803 --> 00:11:30.774\nWe're getting cake on Friday.\n\n231\n00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:33.660\nDarn.\n[LAUGH] So the due date will be for\n\n232\n00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.710\nFriday, the 2nd.\n\n233\n00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.510\nSo it doesn't necessarily need to start.\n\n234\n00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.140\nI just know I have to have\nit done by this point.\n\n235\n00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.210\nWhat is my status?\n\n236\n00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.150\nWell, right now I haven't started it.\n\n237\n00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.080\nBut when we come back and\n\n238\n00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:49.535\nstart updating our task, we could see\nhere we have an in progress, completed.\n\n239\n00:11:49.535 --> 00:11:52.367\nWaiting on someone else,\nthat's always a good excuse, right?\n\n240\n00:11:52.367 --> 00:11:53.835\n[LAUGH] So we could go through here.\n\n241\n00:11:53.835 --> 00:11:55.445\nThe percent completed.\n\n242\n00:11:55.445 --> 00:12:00.165\nMaybe I placed a call to the bakery and\njust got a quote for\n\n243\n00:12:00.165 --> 00:12:05.030\na price, but I didn't actually order\nthe cake, so maybe I'm 50% done.\n\n244\n00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.950\nWhat is the priority?\n\n245\n00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.810\nWell, this has gotta be a high\npriority for cake for Wes.\n\n246\n00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.230\nAnd then what do I need a reminder for?\n\n247\n00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:16.060\nI need to make sure, hey, if by 8\nAM on a Friday I haven't done this,\n\n248\n00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.110\nmake sure I alert myself,\ncuz we're doing the cake in the afternoon.\n\n249\n00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.900\nSo I should go ahead and make sure.\n\n250\n00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.478\nLet's make this happen, so\nI can put reminders on here.\n\n251\n00:12:26.478 --> 00:12:30.470\nAnd then you can see across the top,\nit's very much like an appointment.\n\n252\n00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:35.100\nYou do have a reoccurring one and we'll go\nthrough that example in just a little bit,\n\n253\n00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.820\nbecause I have one created.\n\n254\n00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:41.060\nAnd then you could also add in all\nof your notes within your task here.\n\n255\n00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.670\nYou can go through your insert and\nyour format and\n\n256\n00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:49.300\nyour review tab to do all the different\nformatting options that you would want for\n\n257\n00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.600\nwhere you want to put in\nsome of your information.\n\n258\n00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:59.040\nI'm gonna come back over to this task\ntab within this new task window.\n\n259\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.020\nThese are just the basics.\n\n260\n00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:01.530\nWhat is it?\n\n261\n00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:02.200\nWhen is it due?\n\n262\n00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.020\nWhat's the priority?\n\n263\n00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.440\nWhat's my status?\n\n264\n00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.370\nBut you could also have,\nover here, the details.\n\n265\n00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:08.380\nThe date completed.\n\n266\n00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.620\nThe total work.\n\n267\n00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.150\nActual work.\n\n268\n00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.830\nMileage.\n\n269\n00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:15.773\nSo if you think about it, this is\nwhere depending on your organization,\n\n270\n00:13:15.773 --> 00:13:20.877\nyou might use tasks to be able to kind\nof log your time on a specific project,\n\n271\n00:13:20.877 --> 00:13:25.677\nor maybe this is almost like an invoice\nfor your hours as a freelancer.\n\n272\n00:13:25.677 --> 00:13:29.975\nNot sure as a freelancer, I would\ndefinitely have like an actual invoice and\n\n273\n00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:32.530\ncontract, but that's another topic.\n\n274\n00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:36.810\nBut you can see that there are some other\ndetails that you can add to a task, and\n\n275\n00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:40.270\nthen once you start updating\nyou could send a report.\n\n276\n00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.640\nI like the assigned task one and\nthen I could also mark that as complete.\n\n277\n00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:49.027\nSo the different buttons across the top\nthat are associated with this new task\n\n278\n00:13:49.027 --> 00:13:49.577\nwindow.\n\n279\n00:13:49.577 --> 00:13:54.564\nBut for right now, I've got my order\nin the cake task completed, or\n\n280\n00:13:54.564 --> 00:13:59.288\nwell, the creating of the task\ncompleted and I'm gonna save and\n\n281\n00:13:59.288 --> 00:14:01.930\nclose that, and it goes in my list.\n\n282\n00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:02.930\nThere it is.\n\n283\n00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:07.730\nThat I have order cake for Wes and I have\nall of my different statuses right there.\n\n284\n00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.800\nAnd status is already in there,\nso that's why.\n\n285\n00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.650\nOkay, there's my column.\n\n286\n00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.100\nAnd I could go and give it a category or\n\n287\n00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:19.933\nanything else that I would like to do\nto organize myself and there you go.\n\n288\n00:14:19.933 --> 00:14:26.060\nNow I did have a task on this list\nthat says, show task episode.\n\n289\n00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.090\nHey guess what?\n\n290\n00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.460\nI'm doing that right now, aren't I?\n\n291\n00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.413\nSo I should go ahead and update this task.\n\n292\n00:14:30.413 --> 00:14:34.672\nOne other thing that happened\nbefore we started is that I had\n\n293\n00:14:34.672 --> 00:14:37.120\na reminder that came up.\n\n294\n00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.006\nNow we've had reminders come\nup when we have appointments.\n\n295\n00:14:40.006 --> 00:14:42.293\nBut they come up as tasks too.\n\n296\n00:14:42.293 --> 00:14:46.485\nBut you see that it gets a little\ndifferent icon than an appointment or\n\n297\n00:14:46.485 --> 00:14:51.970\na meeting because, well, it's not either\none of those, so it shows a task.\n\n298\n00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:55.990\nI did read a few things about when you\nstart getting into a reoccurring task.\n\n299\n00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.730\nLike maybe you need something every day\nto remind you, hey, what are the plans.\n\n300\n00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.190\nOr walk the dog.\n\n301\n00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:04.900\nOr something to that effect, and\nyou want it to remind you every day.\n\n302\n00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.340\nWell, if you dismiss it,\nit's going to not do that anymore,\n\n303\n00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.640\njust like what the dismissed means.\n\n304\n00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.210\nSo there's one of those where hey, I wanna\nmake sure that when this window comes up,\n\n305\n00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:17.230\nit's like I've already done it.\n\n306\n00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.960\nYou don't wanna just dismiss it.\n\n307\n00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.100\nYou can right click it on and\nyou can mark as complete.\n\n308\n00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.220\nAnd that way it'll cross it off your list.\n\n309\n00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.334\nSo when you come back in your task later,\nit's like, no, I know I walked the dog.\n\n310\n00:15:28.334 --> 00:15:32.930\nWell, dismiss is not the same as complete\nwithin this little reminder window.\n\n311\n00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.370\nNow of course,\nyou can come in your task and\n\n312\n00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.610\nI'll show you how to mark\nit as complete separately.\n\n313\n00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.910\nBut I just wanted to kind of throw\nthat out there for you there.\n\n314\n00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.770\nI'm gonna close this just cuz I don't\nwant to do anything within this window,\n\n315\n00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.380\nto show you the other way.\n\n316\n00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.810\nUpdating a task.\n\n317\n00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.345\nWe're half way through this episode, or\nat least I think we're half way through.\n\n318\n00:15:49.345 --> 00:15:50.032\n&gt;&gt; Yes we are.\n\n319\n00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:53.941\n&gt;&gt; All right, perfect, so I wanna say\nthat I'm 50% complete with the task\n\n320\n00:15:53.941 --> 00:15:56.934\nat hand today,\nwhich is showing the task in the episode.\n\n321\n00:15:56.934 --> 00:15:59.444\nOpen up the task, just double-click it.\n\n322\n00:15:59.444 --> 00:16:01.186\nIt opens this up.\n\n323\n00:16:01.186 --> 00:16:03.990\nSo now, let me go ahead and\nupdate my status.\n\n324\n00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:05.356\nIt is In Progress.\n\n325\n00:16:05.356 --> 00:16:08.200\nIt is about 50% complete.\n\n326\n00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.678\nI can make a note of saying going good.\n\n327\n00:16:11.678 --> 00:16:13.970\nOkay well, if I could type.\n\n328\n00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.050\nThere we go.\n\n329\n00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.025\nI add my little note.\n\n330\n00:16:18.025 --> 00:16:21.643\nThis is where in your notes within\nyour tasks you might wanna put things\n\n331\n00:16:21.643 --> 00:16:23.740\nlike a time and date, like a time stamp.\n\n332\n00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.560\nAnd that's where OneNote can have\nsome other really cool features.\n\n333\n00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.230\nIt's a different product,\nbut just extending out and\n\n334\n00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:34.110\ngiving you a little teaser about using\nOneNote to keep yourself organized\n\n335\n00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:35.430\nin conjunction with Outlook.\n\n336\n00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:36.310\nIt's pretty awesome.\n\n337\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:41.740\nSo I Save and close this, and\nnow I have it's In Progress.\n\n338\n00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.990\nI can show my task, yes thank you.\n\n339\n00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:47.503\nI am going to go ahead and\ndismiss this for now.\n\n340\n00:16:47.503 --> 00:16:49.755\nYes, I don't want to\nhave you show me anymore.\n\n341\n00:16:49.755 --> 00:16:51.039\nAnd so there we go.\n\n342\n00:16:51.039 --> 00:16:55.868\nWell, what if I have a boss that\nwants me to update them on the status\n\n343\n00:16:55.868 --> 00:16:59.688\nas I'm doing a specific project or\nusing that task.\n\n344\n00:16:59.688 --> 00:17:03.320\nWell, I'm halfway through my show,\nor my episode, and\n\n345\n00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:08.655\nmaybe I need to send this to Don, or\nto Tim, or to Peter, to anybody, right?\n\n346\n00:17:08.655 --> 00:17:10.520\nI can open up this task.\n\n347\n00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:16.220\nI can send this status report and\nnotice that the email will show them\n\n348\n00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:21.140\nthat this is the subject, this is the due\ndate and all of my services and my notes.\n\n349\n00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.379\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n350\n00:17:22.379 --> 00:17:27.300\nNotice they will get a task status report.\n\n351\n00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.930\nThat's hard to say if you go really fast.\n\n352\n00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:33.653\nSo I can address this to,\nwe'll go with JT.\n\n353\n00:17:33.653 --> 00:17:38.050\nAnd that way JT can see\nthe status of my tasks.\n\n354\n00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:39.330\nAnd I will Save and close this.\n\n355\n00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.357\nOr we'll get a little further down, so\n\n356\n00:17:42.357 --> 00:17:46.596\nI'll bump that up to 75 now and\nI will Save and close.\n\n357\n00:17:46.596 --> 00:17:50.211\nI have some other ones, some reoccurring\nappointments, [LAUGH] I say,\n\n358\n00:17:50.211 --> 00:17:51.970\nit's really reoccurring tasks.\n\n359\n00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:55.600\nCuz you think about reoccurring\nappointments, I put those two together.\n\n360\n00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.270\nWe're on task.\n\n361\n00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.659\nWe have watering the plants.\n\n362\n00:17:58.659 --> 00:17:59.991\nOpen this up.\n\n363\n00:17:59.991 --> 00:18:01.924\nNotice that this is due on Friday,\n\n364\n00:18:01.924 --> 00:18:05.801\ncuz I need to water the plants while\nthe assistant is out on vacation.\n\n365\n00:18:05.801 --> 00:18:09.717\nCuz usually her job is to take care\nof the plants, because when I try to,\n\n366\n00:18:09.717 --> 00:18:10.840\nI always kill them.\n\n367\n00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.080\nSo we need to make sure\nthat somebody helps me.\n\n368\n00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.937\nBut it's my job, and\nI got to remind myself, so\n\n369\n00:18:16.937 --> 00:18:22.823\nI put a re-occurrence on this,\nto make sure that it happens everyday and\n\n370\n00:18:22.823 --> 00:18:28.149\nto also regenerate new task one\nday after each task is completed.\n\n371\n00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:31.792\nSo go ahead and\nmake sure you make it happen again.\n\n372\n00:18:31.792 --> 00:18:34.523\nSo it reminds me the very next\nday that this is gonna happen.\n\n373\n00:18:34.523 --> 00:18:37.933\nAnd this is gonna happen after five\noccurrences because it starts on Monday\n\n374\n00:18:37.933 --> 00:18:39.250\nand goes to Friday.\n\n375\n00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:43.460\nSo, I can set this re-occurrence just the\nsame way that you can do an appointment.\n\n376\n00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.450\nAnd I can say yes.\n\n377\n00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.740\nNow, this is set for next week, so\n\n378\n00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:52.020\nthat's why you're not going to\nsee it in the list as completed.\n\n379\n00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.550\nBut, I wanted to jump over to\nLance really quick because\n\n380\n00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:58.530\nI put a reoccurring\nappointment on his tasks.\n\n381\n00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:04.080\nAnd you can see eat breakfast [LAUGH] you\nknow sometimes you gotta remind yourself.\n\n382\n00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.824\nSo it has eat breakfast and\nhe completed it on the 30th.\n\n383\n00:19:07.824 --> 00:19:11.619\nAnd then you can see eat breakfast\ncompleted on the 30th, eat breakfast,\n\n384\n00:19:11.619 --> 00:19:15.830\nlook there's today, which is 6/1,\nwell actually today's the 31st.\n\n385\n00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.888\nWell anyways, I got a little ahead of\nmyself, but if I came into here and\n\n386\n00:19:19.888 --> 00:19:21.522\nI marked this as completed.\n\n387\n00:19:21.522 --> 00:19:26.111\nAnd by the way, let me just show you\na little trick if you want to say in this\n\n388\n00:19:26.111 --> 00:19:29.121\nList View,\ndo you see that this little status,\n\n389\n00:19:29.121 --> 00:19:34.090\nI don't necessarily have to open the task,\nI can mark it right here.\n\n390\n00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:38.830\nOr, I could change some different things,\nmaybe I want to say eat breakfast now.\n\n391\n00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.530\nI could go ahead and\nactually type in the subject.\n\n392\n00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.450\nSo, this List View is also\nmore of like an editor or\n\n393\n00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:49.080\nupdating, as well as just\nopening the task individually.\n\n394\n00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:54.420\nSo, I could mark this as completed.\n\n395\n00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.300\nAnd did you see, right there.\n\n396\n00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.107\nIt happened kinda quickly,\nbut it went ahead and\n\n397\n00:19:59.107 --> 00:20:02.403\nput this one as Completed and\nthe next one as Not Started.\n\n398\n00:20:02.403 --> 00:20:05.454\nSo that regenerated and\nthat re-occurrence is going ahead and\n\n399\n00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:06.900\nputting that back in my list.\n\n400\n00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.330\nI'm a little jumping ahead in time here.\n\n401\n00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.630\nWe're time traveling.\n\n402\n00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:15.223\nBut well we're time traveling all the time\nin these recording episodes cuz it can be\n\n403\n00:20:15.223 --> 00:20:18.708\nwhatever day it is for you, but\nit's whatever day it is for me.\n\n404\n00:20:18.708 --> 00:20:22.222\nYou know Vonn, you've shown us how to do\nit let's say from the first person but\n\n405\n00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:25.400\nwhat if I happen to be, I don't know,\nlet's say a project lead.\n\n406\n00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.390\nAnd I have multiple tasks that\nmaybe I want to assign out to other\n\n407\n00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.200\npeople in the team.\n\n408\n00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.190\nIs there a way that I can do that, rather\nthan just from the first person view,\n\n409\n00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.340\nmaybe assign somebody on a task as well?\n\n410\n00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.910\nI love that step.\n\n411\n00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:40.820\nSo let's switch over here to Joey,\nand you know what?\n\n412\n00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.530\nI have determined that I am\nnot responsible enough for\n\n413\n00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:45.760\nwatering the plants.\n\n414\n00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.460\nSo I'm gonna give that to you, Wes.\n\n415\n00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.607\nPerfect.\nWell, you are now going to be JT.\n\n416\n00:20:49.607 --> 00:20:52.521\nYou might want to change the color from\nthe green status cuz I'm not a green\n\n417\n00:20:52.521 --> 00:20:53.290\nthumb, to brown.\n\n418\n00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:54.870\nCuz I'll probably kill it too.\n\n419\n00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:55.500\nYeah, I know.\n\n420\n00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.335\nWe make a great team here.\n\n421\n00:20:56.335 --> 00:20:56.947\nPerfect.\n\n422\n00:20:56.947 --> 00:21:02.384\n[LAUGH] So if I wanted to assign a task\nto somebody I'm going to open it and\n\n423\n00:21:02.384 --> 00:21:08.210\nI'm saying, hey, I'm gonna move this\non and I'm going to assign a task.\n\n424\n00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:11.945\nNow this is assigning a task from\nan already created task that I made for\n\n425\n00:21:11.945 --> 00:21:12.461\nmyself.\n\n426\n00:21:12.461 --> 00:21:14.980\nSo I open it and now I'm passing it off.\n\n427\n00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:18.600\nThe other option, just really quickly,\nthat the new task,\n\n428\n00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.400\nthere is also in the new items\nthere is a Task Request.\n\n429\n00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.663\nThis is where I'm not even gonna go\nthrough the process of making it\n\n430\n00:21:25.663 --> 00:21:26.314\nfor myself.\n\n431\n00:21:26.314 --> 00:21:28.802\nI'm just gonna assign it right away.\n\n432\n00:21:28.802 --> 00:21:30.510\nSo it's whichever way you wanna do it.\n\n433\n00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.340\nIt's gonna end up being the same thing.\n\n434\n00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.845\nYou're putting it off to somebody else.\n\n435\n00:21:34.845 --> 00:21:38.942\n[LAUGH] So\nlet's open this existing one [SOUND].\n\n436\n00:21:38.942 --> 00:21:39.667\nLet's go ahead and\n\n437\n00:21:39.667 --> 00:21:42.560\nthat was a little hiccup by the way I\nhave these random hiccups that come.\n\n438\n00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.745\nI don't know why,\n\n439\n00:21:43.745 --> 00:21:48.871\npeople are like excuse you I'm like no\nthat it's just a hiccup but thank you.\n\n440\n00:21:48.871 --> 00:21:52.517\nSo I'm going to assign this task and\nI'm going to assign\n\n441\n00:21:52.517 --> 00:21:57.027\nit to I've decided to change it to Lance,\nyou're going to be Lance.\n\n442\n00:21:57.027 --> 00:21:59.595\nOkay, as long as I have his paycheck.\n\n443\n00:21:59.595 --> 00:22:03.260\nYeah right, his royalties are awesome.\n\n444\n00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.180\nSo we have Lance,\nwe're going to water the plants and\n\n445\n00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:10.050\nI wanna ask him to send me a status\nreport when the task is complete.\n\n446\n00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.680\nThat's fantastic, great water the plants.\n\n447\n00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.260\nAnd it says keep an updated\ncopy on this task list.\n\n448\n00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.300\nThat's okay.\n\n449\n00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.410\nIt's not allowing me to check this off\nbecause it's gonna already do that.\n\n450\n00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:21.830\nSo I'm gonna send this.\n\n451\n00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:26.690\nSince you are no longer,\nthe task reminder has been turned off.\n\n452\n00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:27.790\nGood.\n\n453\n00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:30.580\nGoes ahead and sends it off.\n\n454\n00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.329\nSo let's jump over here to Lance and\nsee what Lance gets.\n\n455\n00:22:34.329 --> 00:22:38.384\nWell just like an appointment or\na meeting request,\n\n456\n00:22:38.384 --> 00:22:43.923\nthat it will come up into his email\nthat Joey has given me a task request.\n\n457\n00:22:43.923 --> 00:22:48.891\nNow of course, Lance could always deny it,\n[LAUGH] no, you water the plants.\n\n458\n00:22:48.891 --> 00:22:54.192\nBut let's say Lance is like, hey,\nyou know what Joey's the boss so\n\n459\n00:22:54.192 --> 00:22:58.842\nI need to make sure I do what\nthe boss says so I'll go ahead and\n\n460\n00:22:58.842 --> 00:23:01.826\naccept this and put it on my response.\n\n461\n00:23:01.826 --> 00:23:04.910\nNow I could go ahead and\nsend the response without editing it.\n\n462\n00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:07.350\nI can make a little note if I wanted to.\n\n463\n00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:10.220\nAs Lance, I will say OK.\n\n464\n00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.886\nCome over here to my Tasks list and\n\n465\n00:23:12.886 --> 00:23:17.562\nit will be on my Tasks list right there,\nwater the plants.\n\n466\n00:23:17.562 --> 00:23:20.923\nAnd now I have been the one that is,\nas Lance,\n\n467\n00:23:20.923 --> 00:23:25.184\nthat is going to be responsible for\nwatering the plants.\n\n468\n00:23:25.184 --> 00:23:30.677\nNow if I wanted to go ahead, and\nas Lance say that it is in progress, and\n\n469\n00:23:30.677 --> 00:23:37.900\nit is 10% complete, cuz you don't have to\ngo by the bumpy arrows for the 25 and 50%.\n\n470\n00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:42.403\nAnd I'm saying, Started Early.\n\n471\n00:23:42.403 --> 00:23:46.297\nI don't know why I capitalized early,\nbut I'm going to Save and Close that.\n\n472\n00:23:46.297 --> 00:23:51.671\nAnd I could send those progress reports\nback to Joey as he gets them or\n\n473\n00:23:51.671 --> 00:23:55.365\nas I'm done with them and\nI send them off to it.\n\n474\n00:23:55.365 --> 00:24:00.912\nNow if I wanted to mark this as complete,\nthen that will be sent over to Joey,\n\n475\n00:24:00.912 --> 00:24:06.050\nthat says task is completed and\nthen everything is crossed off.\n\n476\n00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:09.600\nSo the same way that you could\ndo your meetings, and yes,\n\n477\n00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.660\neverybody's accepted and\nit goes ahead and crosses it off.\n\n478\n00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.884\nIt will do the same thing for\nyou with your task.\n\n479\n00:24:15.884 --> 00:24:17.597\nAnd I believe that he should have,\n\n480\n00:24:17.597 --> 00:24:21.749\nyes, he should have gotten an email over\nhere that says that the task was accepted.\n\n481\n00:24:21.749 --> 00:24:25.620\nAnd he will get the same response\nwhen the task is completed.\n\n482\n00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:30.082\nSo assigning tasks is a beautiful thing to\nkind of start letting people know that you\n\n483\n00:24:30.082 --> 00:24:32.350\nwant them to do things.\n\n484\n00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:35.141\nAll right, now there's another\nthing that I can't on this one,\n\n485\n00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:37.088\nI really don't understand the difference.\n\n486\n00:24:37.088 --> 00:24:39.248\nSo you're gonna have to\nhelp me out on this one,\n\n487\n00:24:39.248 --> 00:24:42.710\nbecause that's not the only way we can\nget somebody else involved in a task.\n\n488\n00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.430\nCan you tell me a little bit\nabout forwarding a task?\n\n489\n00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:49.805\nYes, so forwarding,\nit's not the same as assigning.\n\n490\n00:24:49.805 --> 00:24:52.829\nIt's just like when we\nforward a contact or\n\n491\n00:24:52.829 --> 00:24:57.630\nwe forward an appointment,\nwe're not requiring them to be there.\n\n492\n00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:59.857\nSo we're not asking them for a meeting.\n\n493\n00:24:59.857 --> 00:25:03.552\nAnd the same with a contact,\nwe're not sharing the contact necessarily,\n\n494\n00:25:03.552 --> 00:25:04.940\nlike all of our contacts.\n\n495\n00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.641\nI'm just giving them this one and\n\n496\n00:25:06.641 --> 00:25:10.712\nthen they can put that appointment on\ntheir calendar as their own appointment,\n\n497\n00:25:10.712 --> 00:25:14.622\nor their contacts in their contacts,\nand then it becomes them as the owner.\n\n498\n00:25:14.622 --> 00:25:17.723\nBut there's no connection,\nif you wanna say,\n\n499\n00:25:17.723 --> 00:25:22.828\nback to me as being the meeting\norganizer or the assigner of the task.\n\n500\n00:25:22.828 --> 00:25:25.726\nSo you could forward on a task and\nthey can move it on over.\n\n501\n00:25:25.726 --> 00:25:28.329\nAnd that actually brings up,\nfor some reason,\n\n502\n00:25:28.329 --> 00:25:33.230\nI don't know why this is bringing it up,\nI could also make multiple task lists.\n\n503\n00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:37.570\nJust like if I have contacts,\nI have my regular contacts for my work.\n\n504\n00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.131\nMaybe I wanna make a separate one for\nmy personal contacts.\n\n505\n00:25:40.131 --> 00:25:42.756\nOr just like we had Lance\nhad his own cat calendar for\n\n506\n00:25:42.756 --> 00:25:45.518\nall of his different cat shows\nthat he was going to do.\n\n507\n00:25:45.518 --> 00:25:48.100\nYou can do the same thing with your tasks.\n\n508\n00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.260\nLet me show you.\n\n509\n00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.455\nDown here in Joey,\nif I come over to my tasks.\n\n510\n00:25:52.455 --> 00:25:56.577\nIf I wanna make my own task list,\nlet's start with that first.\n\n511\n00:25:56.577 --> 00:26:01.730\nYou right-click on the task list,\nthe one that is here.\n\n512\n00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:03.440\nBy the way, this task support team,\n\n513\n00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.020\nthis is because Joey's part\nof a support team group.\n\n514\n00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.610\nThat's why there's already another task\n\n515\n00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.598\nlist that is not the same\nas his default one.\n\n516\n00:26:13.598 --> 00:26:19.280\nIf I right-click on here and\ngo to New Folder, I'm making one called\n\n517\n00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.870\nmy personal tasks, and\nis going into the task folder.\n\n518\n00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:30.020\nJust making sure, we click OK, and notice\nthat now I have another subcategory,\n\n519\n00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:34.940\nor just separate category of\ntasks that I can have for myself.\n\n520\n00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.840\nSo always an option to\nmake your own lists.\n\n521\n00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.440\nIf I open up my tasks, and\n\n522\n00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:46.660\nI wanted to, maybe forward this episode,\nthe show tasks in episode.\n\n523\n00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:52.030\nI can forward this on to,\nwe'll go with Lance as well.\n\n524\n00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.820\nNotice it shows up as an Outlook item.\n\n525\n00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:59.720\nClick Send, and then Lance will be able\nto go ahead and get it as a email.\n\n526\n00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.484\nIt comes over to him.\n\n527\n00:27:03.484 --> 00:27:04.946\nHere is the forward.\n\n528\n00:27:04.946 --> 00:27:10.890\nSo I could open this here,\nand now it has just the task.\n\n529\n00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:16.930\nBut I want this task to come\ninto my tasks cuz now I'm Lance.\n\n530\n00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:20.650\nYou can, really the easiest way,\nkeep the email open,\n\n531\n00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:24.990\nbring over your tasks\nin your main Outlook.\n\n532\n00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:32.600\nBring up the email, and you can just\ndrag it right into your task list.\n\n533\n00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:39.600\nYou might have saw it behind me, but now\nyou can see that the show tasks is here.\n\n534\n00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.786\nAnd now I've gone ahead and added it\nto my, it's not assigned from Joey,\n\n535\n00:27:43.786 --> 00:27:47.769\nit's just now he was like sharing it\nwith me and forwarding it along for\n\n536\n00:27:47.769 --> 00:27:50.040\nme as Lance to be able to do what I want.\n\n537\n00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.030\nIt could have just been\nlike I just need to see it.\n\n538\n00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:53.460\nI don't need to add it to my own list.\n\n539\n00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:56.170\nOr, hey, I want to add it to mine\nbecause I think that's a good task for\n\n540\n00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:57.490\nme to have as well.\n\n541\n00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:58.720\nSo that's how you can forward it.\n\n542\n00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.960\nA lot of great information there in\nOutlook, when it comes to tasks and notes.\n\n543\n00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.170\nHowever, it does look like we are coming\nto the end of another great episode.\n\n544\n00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:08.990\nBut before we do, Vonne, do you have\nany additional words you'd like to say?\n\n545\n00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:12.510\nI have one last note,\nit's to show you, how to do notes.\n\n546\n00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.240\nVery good.\n\n547\n00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:18.220\nBut it is kind of small, so there's not\na lot of things you can do with notes.\n\n548\n00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.850\nIt's really just a place where\nyou put them, that's it.\n\n549\n00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:25.220\nLet's jump back down in here\none last time, and you can see,\n\n550\n00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:29.340\nif I jump over here to Joey,\nand I'm going to close this.\n\n551\n00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.890\nMy notes are in the navigation\npane down at the bottom.\n\n552\n00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:34.209\nYou're not gonna see them across the top.\n\n553\n00:28:34.209 --> 00:28:36.960\nOne, because I don't have\na large enough resolution.\n\n554\n00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:42.060\nBut also because, I think it's by\ndefault to only show four little icons.\n\n555\n00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:43.830\nIf you go to the Navigation Icons.\n\n556\n00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:44.790\nThere it is, yeah.\n\n557\n00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:48.310\nYou wanna go ahead and do five, and\nnotice that one, two, three, four, five.\n\n558\n00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:51.560\nNotes is the fifth one in this list.\n\n559\n00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.180\nSo you can go ahead and put that in.\n\n560\n00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.880\nAnd that way your notes will\nshow down at the bottom.\n\n561\n00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.240\nNotice I just went to five and\nit still doesn't do anything.\n\n562\n00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.490\nThat's okay,\nwe click the little ellipsis button.\n\n563\n00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:03.890\nWe click on Notes, and\nthat's really all it is.\n\n564\n00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:05.990\n[LAUGH] They're little,\nelectronic sticky notes.\n\n565\n00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:07.528\nI have note number two.\n\n566\n00:29:07.528 --> 00:29:09.550\nI will type more info in this note.\n\n567\n00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:14.044\n[LAUGH] And it does have the date and\ntime, so that's a nice little feature.\n\n568\n00:29:14.044 --> 00:29:18.360\nI could, this is my note,\nooh wow, that's a really good one.\n\n569\n00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:23.325\nIf I want to make a new one,\nI could say new note number three.\n\n570\n00:29:23.325 --> 00:29:25.115\nAnd all you do is just close it.\n\n571\n00:29:25.115 --> 00:29:27.095\nAnd you can move them around.\n\n572\n00:29:27.095 --> 00:29:30.920\nYou can put categories on them, so that\nway when you start doing your searching,\n\n573\n00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:35.915\nit'll search for anything in Outlook\nwith this particular category.\n\n574\n00:29:35.915 --> 00:29:37.315\nSo you could go there.\n\n575\n00:29:37.315 --> 00:29:40.825\nYou could forward a note.\n\n576\n00:29:40.825 --> 00:29:43.563\nJust like you could forward a contact and\neverything like that.\n\n577\n00:29:43.563 --> 00:29:44.995\nYou could print it.\n\n578\n00:29:44.995 --> 00:29:50.820\nI could put them into the last\nseven days and new notes.\n\n579\n00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.670\nAnd this is not like as an afterthought,\nbut\n\n580\n00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:58.520\nthere's really not much more you\ncan do with your notes necessarily.\n\n581\n00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:02.230\nIt's just your notes.\n\n582\n00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:03.225\nThat's all, really.\n\n583\n00:30:03.225 --> 00:30:05.860\n[LAUGH] I guess views, right there.\n\n584\n00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.490\nWe have the small icons,\nwe could have our lists.\n\n585\n00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:11.140\nJust the same way that we've done\nwith all of our different items.\n\n586\n00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:14.980\nAnd I can change them, I can reset them,\nand I can categorize them.\n\n587\n00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.470\nAnd that's about it for notes.\n\n588\n00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:20.623\nBut, it's a cute little feature.\n\n589\n00:30:20.623 --> 00:30:21.490\n[LAUGH] I like to move them around.\n\n590\n00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:25.060\nI like to make them color coded, and I\nreally like to write on physical notes for\n\n591\n00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:25.990\nmyself.\n\n592\n00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:27.070\nAnd stick them to my monitor.\n\n593\n00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.320\nJust don't put your passwords there.\n\n594\n00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.180\nThat's right,\nthat's never where we put passwords.\n\n595\n00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.300\nWell, that's a great place to wrap it up,\nand also to give me a chance to\n\n596\n00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.580\nhit the treadmill before I\ntackle the task of eating cake.\n\n597\n00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:41.720\nSo great place there, remember I've been\nyour host for OfficeProTV, Wes Brian.\n\n598\n00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.530\nAnd I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n599\n00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:43.762\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n600\n00:30:43.762 -->

your productivity\nin the workplace.\n\n4\n00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:10.746\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n5\n00:00:10.746 --> 00:00:14.835\nIn today's episode, we're continuing\nthrough our series in Office 2016.\n\n6\n00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:17.800\nJoining us back in the studios is\nnone other than Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.820\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n8\n00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.890\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great,\nwe have come to the groups episode.\n\n9\n00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.283\nYes, I have been referring to groups\npretty much through the entire show.\n\n10\n00:00:28.283 --> 00:00:29.355\n[LAUGH] You're like,\n\n11\n00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:33.238\nI'm gonna find that episode and learn\nabout what these groups are all about.\n\n12\n00:00:33.238 --> 00:00:38.135\nSo you are here, we're ready to go,\nso what is a group?\n\n13\n00:00:38.135 --> 00:00:41.507\nIt's just like you think of\na regular group of people, right?\n\n14\n00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:45.319\nWe're kinda hanging out, and\nwe have a group, if you wanna say.\n\n15\n00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:47.660\nWe're the hosts, right, of ITProTV.\n\n16\n00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.369\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n17\n00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:51.342\n&gt;&gt; And we even have an email address for\nthat, don't we?\n\n18\n00:00:51.342 --> 00:00:55.828\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it's allhosts@itpro.tv,\nif I can remember what our address is.\n\n19\n00:00:55.828 --> 00:00:57.924\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] and I'm like,\nit's something like that.\n\n20\n00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:03.303\n[LAUGH] There's something where it's\nnot just vonne@itprotv or wes@itprotv.\n\n21\n00:01:03.303 --> 00:01:07.222\nWe are hosts@itprotv.\n\n22\n00:01:07.222 --> 00:01:10.530\nAnd you might see these\nemails all the time like\n\n23\n00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.070\nsupport@company.com or what have you.\n\n24\n00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.938\nSo it's not to a specific person.\n\n25\n00:01:16.938 --> 00:01:19.894\nIt is a catch all email if you wanna say.\n\n26\n00:01:19.894 --> 00:01:26.510\nAnd so what you could do in Office\n365 is you can create your own group.\n\n27\n00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.040\nAnd the nice thing is,\nis that you can do it on your own.\n\n28\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.108\nIn the sense of, you don't have\nto have an administrator do this.\n\n29\n00:01:33.108 --> 00:01:37.125\nNow I'm gonna pause right there for\na quick little part of like depending on\n\n30\n00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:41.145\nyour security settings and how your\nadministrator sets up your particular\n\n31\n00:01:41.145 --> 00:01:45.890\nnetwork, that might have another thing to\nwhere, well, I can't create my own group.\n\n32\n00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.657\nYou told me I could create my own group,\nVonne, talk to your IT guy.\n\n33\n00:01:49.657 --> 00:01:54.096\n[LAUGH] So I don't want to say a blanket\nstatement because as soon as I say that,\n\n34\n00:01:54.096 --> 00:01:55.820\nthere's some group policy.\n\n35\n00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.728\nI know you know all about group policy,\nWes.\n\n36\n00:01:57.728 --> 00:02:01.680\nThere's something that can make\nsomebody not do something.\n\n37\n00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.742\nWow, that was really descriptive.\n\n38\n00:02:03.742 --> 00:02:08.220\n[LAUGH] So let's go ahead and\njump into our computer.\n\n39\n00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.710\nI brought up a couple websites,\nthese are in your show notes so\n\n40\n00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.980\ndefinitely look at that, and learning\nall about what is an Office 365 group.\n\n41\n00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.713\nJust like I said, it's a group of people,\nand it allows you to collaborate with\n\n42\n00:02:20.713 --> 00:02:25.391\nyour teammates within the same circle,\nif you wanna say, your same network.\n\n43\n00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:30.129\nMaybe we have a project coming up, like\na big project that's gonna be lasting for\n\n44\n00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.790\nsix months and it's for\nthe marketing team.\n\n45\n00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.962\nAnd we decided that we are gonna\nneed to have our own calendar\n\n46\n00:02:35.962 --> 00:02:37.049\nto be able to set up.\n\n47\n00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.850\nAnd it's very specific to\nthis particular project.\n\n48\n00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.201\nAnd we're going to need to have\nsome of our different tasks and\n\n49\n00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:46.816\nwe wanna be able to collaborate with\neach other on all of our notes.\n\n50\n00:02:46.816 --> 00:02:49.855\nYou can create a group and\nyou can name it and\n\n51\n00:02:49.855 --> 00:02:53.839\nyou get your own email that\nis separate from your email.\n\n52\n00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:55.753\nThat you could go ahead and\n\n53\n00:02:55.753 --> 00:03:01.060\nemail everybody at one time like\nprojectamazingness@itprotv.com,\n\n54\n00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.150\nand then everybody on that\nparticular group gets that.\n\n55\n00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.380\nYou can have conversations.\n\n56\n00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.930\nIt's a great way to collaborate,\nso it's pretty cool.\n\n57\n00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.990\nAnd you can see in this particular article\nor this website that's talking about,\n\n58\n00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.880\nyour groups, what do you get in a group?\n\n59\n00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.810\nYou get a shared inbox for conversations.\n\n60\n00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.450\nYou get a shared calendar.\n\n61\n00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.160\nYou get your own SharePoint\ndocument library.\n\n62\n00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.080\nYou can also think of it\nas your own OneDrive folder\n\n63\n00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.800\nthat is separate than your\npersonal OneDrive folder.\n\n64\n00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.010\nLet me clarify that.\n\n65\n00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.131\nYour OneDrive 2016, not the one that's\non your OS on your Windows machine,\n\n66\n00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:46.121\nyour OneNote 2016 that you have all\nof your files storage and everything.\n\n67\n00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:49.888\nBut it's separate, so\nI have regular work, specific group and\n\n68\n00:03:49.888 --> 00:03:54.520\nthen everybody within that group can\nshare documents with each other.\n\n69\n00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.596\nYou can even have your own SharePoint\nteam site where you can have your\n\n70\n00:03:58.596 --> 00:04:02.257\nown website if you wanna say,\nyour intranet with each other.\n\n71\n00:04:02.257 --> 00:04:04.361\nAnd you also get this\nthing called Planner.\n\n72\n00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:09.335\nPlanner is another application\nwithin the Office 365 suite.\n\n73\n00:04:09.335 --> 00:04:13.617\nNow this is what it's saying that you get\nas the default settings of creating group\n\n74\n00:04:13.617 --> 00:04:14.390\nin Outlook.\n\n75\n00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.310\nRemember, every network's\na little bit different,\n\n76\n00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.760\nso make sure you contact your\nIT people about that one.\n\n77\n00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.620\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, this seems like the concept's\na lot like in a Window's domain,\n\n78\n00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.310\nwhere we group people together, based\non a level of access they might need,\n\n79\n00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.580\na certain amount of\nresources they might need or\n\n80\n00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.600\na role that they're performing\nwithin our company.\n\n81\n00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.790\nAnd it doesn't look like\nit's much different here.\n\n82\n00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.405\n&gt;&gt; Spoken like a true techie, yeah.\n\n83\n00:04:35.405 --> 00:04:37.838\n[LAUGH] I'm like, exactly, yep.\n\n84\n00:04:37.838 --> 00:04:42.990\n[LAUGH] And that's what they're letting\nyou do as users to create it yourself.\n\n85\n00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.398\nBut you are right,\nit does allocate specific resources.\n\n86\n00:04:46.398 --> 00:04:49.732\nAnd there are parts in this article\nthat talks about like, hey,\n\n87\n00:04:49.732 --> 00:04:53.340\nwhen you're done with a group,\nyou might wanna delete it in a sense.\n\n88\n00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.677\nLike, you don't need all that,\n\n89\n00:04:55.677 --> 00:05:01.700\nbecause it does take up room on whatever\nyou're storage is within your big stuff.\n\n90\n00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.619\nWow, okay.\n\n91\n00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:06.180\n[LAUGH] But I don't need a tech guy\nto be able to create it for me.\n\n92\n00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.610\nSo yeah, you're exactly right.\n\n93\n00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.556\nI think that's what they did there.\n\n94\n00:05:09.556 --> 00:05:13.010\n[LAUGH] So you can see that it's\ngiving you some information about it.\n\n95\n00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.300\nNow, there are some other products out\nthere in the Office 365 environment.\n\n96\n00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.529\nThere's things called teams.\n\n97\n00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:22.297\nThere's also something called Yammer, so\n\n98\n00:05:22.297 --> 00:05:26.800\nthere's other services that Office\n365 does allow people to have.\n\n99\n00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.460\nDepending on whatever level\nof Office 365 subscription or\n\n100\n00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.320\nplan your organization has.\n\n101\n00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.380\nYou might not have some of it.\n\n102\n00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.488\nBut they're all very much\nthe same flavor in a sense.\n\n103\n00:05:38.488 --> 00:05:40.250\nIt's all about collaborating.\n\n104\n00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.718\nYammer is like your own\npersonal Facebook thing.\n\n105\n00:05:44.718 --> 00:05:48.940\nTeams, it's funny there's an article,\nif you search for\n\n106\n00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.790\nwhat is the difference between teams and\ngroups.\n\n107\n00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.270\nThere's a very interesting article\nthat they talk about the differences.\n\n108\n00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.200\nAnd it's like, well, wait,\nare there differences?\n\n109\n00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.760\nAnd groups are part of teams but\nteams are an extension and\n\n110\n00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.191\nit goes a little crazier and wait, so\nI don't understand what's going on.\n\n111\n00:06:03.191 --> 00:06:05.120\nThat's okay,\nlet's just stick with groups okay?\n\n112\n00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.550\n[LAUGH] But\nI'm not saying that teams are bad.\n\n113\n00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.880\nI think they're very nice,\nit's just an extension.\n\n114\n00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.400\nI think they're kind of using\na little bit of the same\n\n115\n00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.080\nterminology that might get people\na little bit more confused.\n\n116\n00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.020\nSo we're gonna stick with groups, but\nI just at least wanted to mention\n\n117\n00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.930\nthat there are teams out there\nin the Office 365 world.\n\n118\n00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.033\nBack down into this website, you can see\nthat, what do I need to have groups?\n\n119\n00:06:28.033 --> 00:06:33.042\nYou need to have a subscription\nthat has an Exchange outline, and\n\n120\n00:06:33.042 --> 00:06:38.520\nSharePoint outline, so that's,\nI said outline, that says online.\n\n121\n00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.414\n[LAUGH] Wow, my brain was actually\nkind of catching myself there.\n\n122\n00:06:42.414 --> 00:06:43.427\nWhat?\n\n123\n00:06:43.427 --> 00:06:47.610\n[LAUGH] And whether or\nnot it's a public versus a private group.\n\n124\n00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.490\nAnd how do you manage your groups and\nso this is some really good guides for\n\n125\n00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.982\nyou to go through, and\ncheck everything out.\n\n126\n00:06:53.982 --> 00:06:56.474\nNow, how do I create a group in Outlook?\n\n127\n00:06:56.474 --> 00:07:02.263\nBecause I already have one made in\nour Office Pro demo co that has,\n\n128\n00:07:02.263 --> 00:07:06.800\nyou guessed it, JT, Lance and\nJoey all part of it.\n\n129\n00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.601\nSo I can at least show you what\na already created group does, but\n\n130\n00:07:10.601 --> 00:07:15.435\nto create a group it really just,\nyou click the new button in Outlook 2016.\n\n131\n00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:18.472\nIt shows you right there on the Home tab,\nyou can create new group.\n\n132\n00:07:18.472 --> 00:07:21.440\nI know these are really small but\nI'll come to it in just a second.\n\n133\n00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.286\nYou go ahead and give it a name and\nthat becomes your whatever the name is,\n\n134\n00:07:26.286 --> 00:07:30.186\nat, then your domain .com,\ngov, or whatever you have.\n\n135\n00:07:30.186 --> 00:07:32.005\nI don't know if you'd be\nable to do that on .gov.\n\n136\n00:07:32.005 --> 00:07:35.330\n[LAUGH] We'll leave that up to them.\n\n137\n00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.430\nAnd then you can then add members.\n\n138\n00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.943\nAdd members to your group,\nyou can also control whether or\n\n139\n00:07:40.943 --> 00:07:45.188\nnot they see the subscription because\nyou are subscribing to a group.\n\n140\n00:07:45.188 --> 00:07:49.330\nAnd it's just like if you like a Facebook\npage or you become some type of online\n\n141\n00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.774\ngroup to where you start getting\nthose notifications that hey,\n\n142\n00:07:52.774 --> 00:07:54.770\nyou're part of this group.\n\n143\n00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.953\nYou're gonna see that in your news feed.\n\n144\n00:07:56.953 --> 00:08:01.815\nSo you can have it controlled to where\nyou'll see your conversations come through\n\n145\n00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:06.126\nyour inbox So that way you don't have\nto go to your group specific email.\n\n146\n00:08:06.126 --> 00:08:08.900\nSo it just kinda comes through,\nso it's almost like an alert.\n\n147\n00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.640\n&gt;&gt; When you add the members to the group,\nwhen you create them, Vonne,\n\n148\n00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.200\ndoes that give them access to\nthe resources within the group?\n\n149\n00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.700\nRather than having to say, hey,\nokay, I've got this one person, and\n\n150\n00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.150\nI'll manually assign them\nthe access to every resource.\n\n151\n00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.020\nThat seems like it would\nbe a little problematic.\n\n152\n00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.240\n&gt;&gt; That's the cool part about it.\n\n153\n00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.460\nThis is all automatic.\n\n154\n00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.505\nYou just say, I want a new group,\nthis is the name, here are the people and\n\n155\n00:08:27.505 --> 00:08:31.958\nthen poof, all the resources are added for\nyou, so it's pretty, pretty cool.\n\n156\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.667\nAnd then, of course,\nI do have a web page for\n\n157\n00:08:34.667 --> 00:08:38.830\ndeleting a group just to let you\nknow cuz it does talk about.\n\n158\n00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.295\nIt says system resources, so\n\n159\n00:08:40.295 --> 00:08:44.058\nthere is that thing that you were talking\nabout with your techie talk about.\n\n160\n00:08:44.058 --> 00:08:44.918\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n161\n00:08:44.918 --> 00:08:48.750\n[LAUGH] they do allocate specific\namount of resources within your system.\n\n162\n00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.360\nLet's come down over into Joey's Outlook.\n\n163\n00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.082\nIn his inbox, there's actually some,\nin his regular inbox,\n\n164\n00:08:58.082 --> 00:09:02.550\nthat are associated with\na particular group that he's in.\n\n165\n00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:07.315\nSo, it says that Joey Fatone, you have\nbeen added to the Reunion_tour group.\n\n166\n00:09:07.315 --> 00:09:08.806\n[LAUGH] And it says that, hey,\n\n167\n00:09:08.806 --> 00:09:12.995\njust getting started with it you're gonna\nhave some conversations, some files.\n\n168\n00:09:12.995 --> 00:09:15.790\nAll those different things that we\nsaid that come along with a group.\n\n169\n00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:21.699\nSo this is his welcome email that\ncame into his inbox because Joey,\n\n170\n00:09:21.699 --> 00:09:25.190\nI believe Joey was the creator of this.\n\n171\n00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.590\nAnd he made this, and\nhe checked the box on that said, yes,\n\n172\n00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.410\nmake sure all of our conversations\ndo go into each other's inbox.\n\n173\n00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.970\nIf I come over here to this side,\nfolder pane,\n\n174\n00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.797\nnotice there is a section for groups.\n\n175\n00:09:39.797 --> 00:09:43.850\nYou expand that out, there is that\nIT TierOne that he is also a part of.\n\n176\n00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.870\nThis is when Ronnie was teaching\nhis Office 365 Admin episode.\n\n177\n00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.720\nHe was demonstrating\nthat on the back end and\n\n178\n00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.690\nthen this is where Joey is a member of\nthat, and here is the Reunion Tour.\n\n179\n00:09:54.690 --> 00:10:00.510\nThese are some different items\nwithin this particular inbox,\n\n180\n00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.620\nso it is reunion_tour@officeprodemoco.com.\n\n181\n00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.480\nThey have some conversations.\n\n182\n00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.920\nAnd look at how it's not\nlike an email thread.\n\n183\n00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.870\nIt's like a conversation you\nhave almost like a text message\n\n184\n00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.160\nwhere you can see everybody.\n\n185\n00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.790\nAnd it says, hey guys, what's going on?\n\n186\n00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.094\nYou can like different\nparts of that conversation.\n\n187\n00:10:18.094 --> 00:10:20.868\nAnd then that gets sent back and forth, so\n\n188\n00:10:20.868 --> 00:10:25.560\nit's very much a chat within Outlook\nwhen you create a conversation.\n\n189\n00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.321\nAlso notice the tab across\nthe top in our ribbon,\n\n190\n00:10:29.321 --> 00:10:34.183\nthe Home tab of our group,\nConversation, Calendar, Files,\n\n191\n00:10:34.183 --> 00:10:38.772\nNotebook, all of those online\ncollaborative things now,\n\n192\n00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:43.210\nthose resources that we have,\nright for us here.\n\n193\n00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.210\nYou can see that I have the membership.\n\n194\n00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:46.974\nI could unsubscribe to this,\n\n195\n00:10:46.974 --> 00:10:51.080\nand I probably wouldn't want to do\nthis since I am part of this group.\n\n196\n00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.540\nYou could edit the group.\n\n197\n00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.860\nNotice that this is where he did\ncreate this, I don't think as a, well,\n\n198\n00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.650\nwe'll double check this on Lance.\n\n199\n00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.000\nCuz he's a member,\nwe can see if he can edit it too.\n\n200\n00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.480\nSo you could see that he is the owner.\n\n201\n00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.260\nAnd then this is why I think\nthat Lance can't do it.\n\n202\n00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.599\nSo deleting the group,\nadding people to the group.\n\n203\n00:11:10.599 --> 00:11:11.860\nYou can put descriptions.\n\n204\n00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.000\nWhether it's public or\nprivate and that's right there.\n\n205\n00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.090\nSee where it says subscribe new,\nwhoops sorry.\n\n206\n00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.500\nSo they get the group\nconversations in their inbox.\n\n207\n00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.080\nSo if you didn't want them and people\nare like, hey, can you stop having it come\n\n208\n00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.650\ninto the inbox, you as the owner can\ngo ahead and change that for you.\n\n209\n00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:29.620\nAnd you could delete the group.\n\n210\n00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.040\nYou could also change the picture.\n\n211\n00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.570\nI've just kept it the regular Rt there but\n\n212\n00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:38.450\nit does take you out into your account\nonline and you can go ahead and\n\n213\n00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:44.720\nstart managing the different pictures and\nthings like that.\n\n214\n00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.860\nLet's jump over here to Lance.\n\n215\n00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.730\nAnd you can see that\nLance also has the group.\n\n216\n00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.770\nAnd he can come into here,\nclick on Reunion_tour.\n\n217\n00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.430\nSee the same things and\n\n218\n00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.330\nthere's the, yeah, edit group\nis not even available for Lance.\n\n219\n00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.950\nI just wanted to double check on\nthat because I was pretty sure, but\n\n220\n00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.190\nit's one of those.\n\n221\n00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.580\nI know you know this, Wes.\n\n222\n00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.750\nAnytime we say like,\nit will always be this way, guess what?\n\n223\n00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.539\n&gt;&gt; Murphy's law.\n\n224\n00:12:06.539 --> 00:12:08.238\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It won't be.\n\n225\n00:12:08.238 --> 00:12:10.069\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And somebody will be like, no, no,\n\n226\n00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:11.860\nyou can do dah, dah, dah and change it.\n\n227\n00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.573\nYep, you're right.\n\n228\n00:12:12.573 --> 00:12:18.370\n[LAUGH] So I get very careful\nabout this will be this way 100%.\n\n229\n00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.930\nBut notice that Lance has the same options\nof going into the Conversations and\n\n230\n00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:22.650\nthe Calendar.\n\n231\n00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:28.540\nIf you click on Calendar, this is the\nReunion_tour calendar that is different\n\n232\n00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:34.530\nfrom Lance's, or Joey's, or JT's\ncalendar so we can keep it all separate.\n\n233\n00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:40.230\nBut you still have the same options of\ncreating meetings, putting appointments,\n\n234\n00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:41.390\nchanging all your views.\n\n235\n00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.510\nSo it's the same thing that we've\ncovered in all of our other lessons,\n\n236\n00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:50.550\nit's just in a specific space that is\nonly associated with your group and\n\n237\n00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.920\nyour group members and\nbe able to collaborate.\n\n238\n00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.280\nIf I started a new conversation\ninto the Reunion_tour,\n\n239\n00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.890\nI don't even have to address it\nto all the different people.\n\n240\n00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.230\nIt's very much like a distribution list.\n\n241\n00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:08.900\nOr a new group list,\nwhen we're talking about contacts.\n\n242\n00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.170\nI know distribution is the old name.\n\n243\n00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.654\nIt's a new contact group.\n\n244\n00:13:12.654 --> 00:13:14.820\nIt's not the same as a group, okay?\n\n245\n00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.630\nSo just know there's a little\nbit of that difference.\n\n246\n00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.180\nWe did talk about that in the context.\n\n247\n00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.915\nI said it's an extension of it.\n\n248\n00:13:20.915 --> 00:13:22.950\nAnd I can be, hello again.\n\n249\n00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.780\nHi, I know we already have like a hi\nemail, or a conversation going,\n\n250\n00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.900\nI send it along, and then with Joey,\n\n251\n00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:37.890\nJoey will see the Reunion_tour,\nin his groups.\n\n252\n00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:39.950\nAnd he could then start a message here.\n\n253\n00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:42.359\nHow's it going?\n\n254\n00:13:44.078 --> 00:13:45.467\nCome on, go ahead and correct yourself.\n\n255\n00:13:45.467 --> 00:13:46.438\nThere we go.\n\n256\n00:13:46.438 --> 00:13:47.444\nHow's it going?\n\n257\n00:13:47.444 --> 00:13:48.544\nAnd you send it.\n\n258\n00:13:48.544 --> 00:13:52.159\nSo it's not just like\na regular email like I said,\n\n259\n00:13:52.159 --> 00:13:56.620\nyou can see it in action\nnow of our conversation.\n\n260\n00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.110\nWhat if I wanted to go to our Notebook?\n\n261\n00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:03.056\nIf I click on our Notebook,\nthis is gonna take me out to OneNote.\n\n262\n00:14:03.056 --> 00:14:07.000\nNow, it's telling me that I have\na potential security [LAUGH] issue.\n\n263\n00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.905\nThis is because this is connected to\nonline, so it's giving me a little.\n\n264\n00:14:11.905 --> 00:14:13.980\nWell, hey,\nare you sure you want to do this?\n\n265\n00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.727\nBut notice it does, if you look at\nthe address, see it says that it's on\n\n266\n00:14:17.727 --> 00:14:22.170\nour Office Pro, it's on our SharePoint,\nit's on our Reunion_tour site assets.\n\n267\n00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.638\nIt's just saying, I just wanna\nmake sure you're okay with this,\n\n268\n00:14:24.638 --> 00:14:26.680\ndo you know where this is coming from?\n\n269\n00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.380\nAlways read your security warnings,\nYes, I'm good.\n\n270\n00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.690\nSo we're okay to continue.\n\n271\n00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:38.398\nSo it should go ahead and\nlet itself search for some stuff.\n\n272\n00:14:38.398 --> 00:14:39.167\nAnd there we go.\n\n273\n00:14:39.167 --> 00:14:42.752\nYou can see that it's loading up\nthe Reunion_tour notebook right\n\n274\n00:14:42.752 --> 00:14:43.904\ninto my OneNote, and\n\n275\n00:14:43.904 --> 00:14:48.140\nwe're talking about some places that\nwe're going to need to stop on our tour.\n\n276\n00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:51.410\nThey're gonna definitely have to\nstop by Gainesville and come see me.\n\n277\n00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:52.302\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n278\n00:14:52.302 --> 00:14:54.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so\nyou can start adding different things and\n\n279\n00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.950\nthis is available that\nanybody can come into it.\n\n280\n00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:01.100\nNotice it does say that JT and\nlook at last modified,\n\n281\n00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.230\nhow awesome is that, so we all go under\nour same notebook and start adding notes.\n\n282\n00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:08.530\nWe can see who added it, it's almost\nlike trap changes but extended.\n\n283\n00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.080\nSo it's like this great.\n\n284\n00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.414\nSo we can have our OneNote.\n\n285\n00:15:13.414 --> 00:15:15.490\nWe go into our OneDrive account.\n\n286\n00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:20.190\nWe can come into our Files and go into,\nnotice it's taking us out online.\n\n287\n00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:24.004\nWe can go ahead and\nlog in with our regular log in,\n\n288\n00:15:24.004 --> 00:15:27.085\nlog in with our regular log in, [LAUGH].\n\n289\n00:15:27.085 --> 00:15:31.478\nAnd I had actually put a file,\nthank you so much, we got a new look,\n\n290\n00:15:31.478 --> 00:15:33.140\nI guess we upgraded.\n\n291\n00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.530\nAnd that's wonderful,\nI'm gonna go ahead and close this.\n\n292\n00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:40.458\nNotice that I'm in the Reunion_tour,\nSharePoint Drive, you could also refer\n\n293\n00:15:40.458 --> 00:15:45.169\nto it as like your OneDrive within here\ncuz they're One Drive, SharePoint,\n\n294\n00:15:45.169 --> 00:15:46.122\nkind of thing.\n\n295\n00:15:46.122 --> 00:15:48.590\nSame but different, my favorite saying.\n\n296\n00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.750\nAnd I've uploaded a file into here.\n\n297\n00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:54.025\nI can then upload another one and\neverybody has access to it.\n\n298\n00:15:54.025 --> 00:15:58.668\nWe can see our different members and\nso it's just a really great\n\n299\n00:15:58.668 --> 00:16:03.143\nthing that you can do to\ncollaborate with your teammates so.\n\n300\n00:16:03.143 --> 00:16:05.442\nThose are the resources\nthat are in a group.\n\n301\n00:16:05.442 --> 00:16:08.955\nMy suggestion would be to go ahead and\njust jump right in,\n\n302\n00:16:08.955 --> 00:16:11.620\ncreate a group, see how it works.\n\n303\n00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.745\nWith any group, you're gonna have\nto have group participation.\n\n304\n00:16:15.745 --> 00:16:20.736\n[LAUGH] So you need to make sure that\neverybody is on board with this and\n\n305\n00:16:20.736 --> 00:16:25.293\nwilling to go into the group assets and\nreally utilize that and\n\n306\n00:16:25.293 --> 00:16:28.729\nnot kinda say well,\nI always use my calendar.\n\n307\n00:16:28.729 --> 00:16:29.880\nNo, use this calendar.\n\n308\n00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:35.296\nSo you do have to kind of an all in\nmentality from your group to really\n\n309\n00:16:35.296 --> 00:16:40.156\nmaximize a full potential of\na group within Office 365.\n\n310\n00:16:40.156 --> 00:16:44.700\nBut if you can get all your members on\nboard, I think you can see that there's\n\n311\n00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.325\nsome really great benefits to be\nable to get in a group [LAUGH].\n\n312\n00:16:48.325 --> 00:16:52.274\n&gt;&gt; It seems like that's a great piece\nof software or product, if you will,\n\n313\n00:16:52.274 --> 00:16:55.190\nto have when it comes to\nenhancing collaborations and\n\n314\n00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:59.040\nthen simplifying the collaboration\nbetween multiple people there.\n\n315\n00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.361\nI know that we have other types of\ntechnologies that we try to implement that\n\n316\n00:17:02.361 --> 00:17:03.370\nsynchronizes stuff.\n\n317\n00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:07.601\nAnd it's nice to have it in a centralized\nlocation where, like you said, I can look\n\n318\n00:17:07.601 --> 00:17:11.542\nat the timestamps, and I can say,\nokay well, somebody just modified that.\n\n319\n00:17:11.542 --> 00:17:13.693\nSo maybe I don't have to get on\nthe horn with them right away.\n\n320\n00:17:13.693 --> 00:17:15.727\nBut just to have that visibility is great.\n\n321\n00:17:15.727 --> 00:17:17.922\n&gt;&gt; And you mentioned other products and\n\n322\n00:17:17.922 --> 00:17:22.250\nI would like to say that because there\nare a ton of these things out there.\n\n323\n00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:26.608\nAnd not to name names, I'm sure if you're\nanywhere familiar with some of these\n\n324\n00:17:26.608 --> 00:17:29.873\nyour like well, this is just like X or\nthis is just like Y.\n\n325\n00:17:29.873 --> 00:17:33.076\nYou're right,\nthere's all sorts of products out there.\n\n326\n00:17:33.076 --> 00:17:35.678\nI mean social media,\nthere's all this online,\n\n327\n00:17:35.678 --> 00:17:37.653\neverybody wants to be in this space.\n\n328\n00:17:37.653 --> 00:17:42.550\nAnd so I'm not saying that one is better\nthan the other, cuz I honestly just\n\n329\n00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:47.321\ndon't have enough exposure to all of\nthem to really make that decision.\n\n330\n00:17:47.321 --> 00:17:50.722\nI know that since I'm already in Office,\nand\n\n331\n00:17:50.722 --> 00:17:54.580\nI'm using all of this,\nwhy go outside of that?\n\n332\n00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:59.420\nIt's all within this, and if this\nis the thing, if you wanna say that\n\n333\n00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:03.930\nI'm using in my organization,\nif we're all about Office and\n\n334\n00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:10.450\nwe're on Office 365, then use their\nproducts, use what's already there.\n\n335\n00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:14.340\nDon't recreate the wheel, and how do I\nget this to talk to this system, and\n\n336\n00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.920\neverything like that.\n\n337\n00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.148\nEverybody's different,\nbut hey, check it out.\n\n338\n00:18:18.148 --> 00:18:21.022\nAnd yes, it's the same flavor\nof a lot of different things.\n\n339\n00:18:21.022 --> 00:18:25.154\n&gt;&gt; And what I like about it, Vonne, is\njust the fact that every modern operating\n\n340\n00:18:25.154 --> 00:18:29.751\nsystem, I don't care if you come from a\nWindows environment, we've got Macs here.\n\n341\n00:18:29.751 --> 00:18:31.870\nAll they need is a web browser.\n\n342\n00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.780\nYou don't need all these\ndifferent crazy third party tools,\n\n343\n00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.130\nwondering if they're integrating,\nbecause think about it,\n\n344\n00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:41.170\nthat's one of the most common applications\nin any operating system worldwide.\n\n345\n00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:46.080\nAnd it's all you need to really just\nleverage the power of this platform.\n\n346\n00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.620\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and I'm showing you here\nwith our locally installed Outlook\n\n347\n00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.380\n2016 because this is the name of the show.\n\n348\n00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.500\nAnd I was using OneNote, but\n\n349\n00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.836\nall of this stuff is in your\nonline Office 365 account.\n\n350\n00:18:58.836 --> 00:19:01.020\nAnd like you said,\nall you need is a web browser.\n\n351\n00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.710\nSo and I could be in the airport,\nI could be in another country,\n\n352\n00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.310\nI could be all over the world.\n\n353\n00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.810\nAnd as long as I get an internet\nconnection, that's always the main thing.\n\n354\n00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:12.133\nAs long as I can get internet,\nyou can go ahead and do all this, and\n\n355\n00:19:12.133 --> 00:19:16.197\nuse all of the same resources that you\nhave right from your particular account.\n\n356\n00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:20.704\nAnd you can go into your groups and your\nplanner that I didn't necessarily go over\n\n357\n00:19:20.704 --> 00:19:23.564\nright now,\nbecause it is a separate application.\n\n358\n00:19:23.564 --> 00:19:28.409\nBut it's all right at your fingertips\nas long as you get a browser, and\n\n359\n00:19:28.409 --> 00:19:30.722\nthat is the beauty of all of this.\n\n360\n00:19:30.722 --> 00:19:32.857\n&gt;&gt; It kinds sounds like a Mini-Wheats\ncommercial here for me.\n\n361\n00:19:32.857 --> 00:19:35.156\nIt's like the kid in me says,\nwow that's flashy.\n\n362\n00:19:35.156 --> 00:19:37.914\nAnd the techy in me says man,\nthat simplifies administration there.\n\n363\n00:19:37.914 --> 00:19:39.485\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it does look like we're coming to\n\n364\n00:19:39.485 --> 00:19:40.950\nthe end of another episode, Vonne.\n\n365\n00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.960\nBut before we do, do you got any\nparting words that you might\n\n366\n00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.370\nlike to impart to the viewers\nwhen it comes to this product?\n\n367\n00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:52.128\n&gt;&gt; For me, this is the last show or\nmy episode that I'm filming,\n\n368\n00:19:52.128 --> 00:19:55.341\nthis is the last group within our topics.\n\n369\n00:19:55.341 --> 00:20:00.036\nAnd I just really hope you kinda just jump\nright in, really get into the product,\n\n370\n00:20:00.036 --> 00:20:03.990\ncuz the only way you're gonna know\nhow to do it is to use it and try it.\n\n371\n00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:07.200\nWe try it all day long, I mean, I've been\ncreating groups, and I delete them and\n\n372\n00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:07.850\nmove them off.\n\n373\n00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.020\nAnd it's just fun.\n\n374\n00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.230\nSo I hope you've enjoyed everything.\n\n375\n00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:14.988\nAnd if you're watching this cassette\nin succession, if you're not,\n\n376\n00:20:14.988 --> 00:20:17.815\nthen go checkout your other episodes and\njust try it.\n\n377\n00:20:17.815 --> 00:20:20.160\n&gt;&gt; All right, well there's not\nmuch more I can say to that.\n\n378\n00:20:20.160 -->
