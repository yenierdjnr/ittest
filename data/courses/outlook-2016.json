providing for you.\n\n10\n00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:34.193\n[LAUGH] What are we going to\nbe covering in this show?\n\n11\n00:00:34.193 --> 00:00:38.494\nWe're gonna be talking about the basic\nintroduction to what is email?\n\n12\n00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:40.420\nAnd what does it mean when they say SMTP?\n\n13\n00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.680\nAnd what is a server,\nwhat is all this terminology?\n\n14\n00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.210\nBecause that's really the name of\nthe game to really get started.\n\n15\n00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.720\nAnd to really feel comfortable knowing\nwhat you're talking about when you're,\n\n16\n00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.120\nwell, talking about email.\n\n17\n00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.832\nThat is one of the things that\nOutlook is well known for.\n\n18\n00:00:55.832 --> 00:00:58.577\nAnd we're going to be sending and\nreceiving emails,\n\n19\n00:00:58.577 --> 00:01:00.714\ngoing through formatting our messages.\n\n20\n00:01:00.714 --> 00:01:05.510\nAdvanced functions of our options\nthat we can add in our emails, and\n\n21\n00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.100\neverything you can know about for\nemailing other people.\n\n22\n00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.592\nWe also have the section in Outlook for\ncalendar, we'll make sure we're organized.\n\n23\n00:01:14.592 --> 00:01:16.938\nWe're gonna be adding appointments and\nmeetings.\n\n24\n00:01:16.938 --> 00:01:20.503\nWe're also gonna be sharing our\ncalendars with other people.\n\n25\n00:01:20.503 --> 00:01:24.900\nContacts, that's a huge thing\nin our industry with an office.\n\n26\n00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.940\nYou need to know who you're talking to and\n\n27\n00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.190\nhaving those business cards on hand to\nbe able to virtually hand out to people.\n\n28\n00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.270\nWe'll be covering all of those different\ntopics within our context area.\n\n29\n00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.441\nTasks and Notes,\nwe wanna make sure we stay on task.\n\n30\n00:01:39.441 --> 00:01:43.016\nI love a to do list, and I love to\ncross that off so we can go ahead and\n\n31\n00:01:43.016 --> 00:01:45.740\ndo that virtually as well through Outlook.\n\n32\n00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.610\nAnd add little sticky notes here and\nthere to just I have a note for our self.\n\n33\n00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.530\nIn the wonderful world of groups,\nworking in collaboration that's of course\n\n34\n00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.340\nwhat Office365 is really kind\nof wants to get in with you.\n\n35\n00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.906\nThey wanna be able to give you\nall the different tools for\n\n36\n00:02:01.906 --> 00:02:03.333\nyou to collaborate as a group.\n\n37\n00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:06.287\nAnd so you can do that right\nhere through Outlook and\n\n38\n00:02:06.287 --> 00:02:09.250\nnot even have to hopefully\ncontact your IT person.\n\n39\n00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.305\nWho is this for?\n\n40\n00:02:11.305 --> 00:02:13.490\nThis is for all Office users.\n\n41\n00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.900\nAnd when I say Office,\n\n42\n00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.000\nI'm not necessarily always referring\nto the product of Microsoft Office.\n\n43\n00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.474\nIf you're in a working environment,\nwhether it's in a large organization or\n\n44\n00:02:23.474 --> 00:02:24.830\na small organization,\n\n45\n00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.403\nusing Outlook is going to be like the\nlynch pin in all different organizations.\n\n46\n00:02:29.403 --> 00:02:31.628\nBig and small to keep you organized, and\n\n47\n00:02:31.628 --> 00:02:34.600\nto keep you communicating\nwith other people.\n\n48\n00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.570\nThis starts from the very,\nvery beginning of what is an email and\n\n49\n00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.882\nwhat is a server like I\nsaid in that introduction.\n\n50\n00:02:39.882 --> 00:02:44.762\nIt goes all the way to the advanced\nfeatures of going through the options\n\n51\n00:02:44.762 --> 00:02:47.772\nwithin Outlook talking about some higher,\n\n52\n00:02:47.772 --> 00:02:53.400\nif you wanna say level topics to really be\nable to maximize the use of this product.\n\n53\n00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.304\nWhat do I need to know\nbefore I get started?\n\n54\n00:02:57.304 --> 00:03:00.128\nNot much.\nIf you've never use Outlook before\n\n55\n00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:01.163\nthat's fine.\n\n56\n00:03:01.163 --> 00:03:05.265\nNow if you've had familiarity with some\nother Office products may be you know Word\n\n57\n00:03:05.265 --> 00:03:07.232\nreally well or used Excel really well.\n\n58\n00:03:07.232 --> 00:03:12.192\nMaybe you're coming over from using Google\nor Yahoo or some Internet based email.\n\n59\n00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:16.644\nAnd you're now required to use Outlook\nthat can be some great help for\n\n60\n00:03:16.644 --> 00:03:19.962\nyou to be able to get\nsomewhat of your familiarity.\n\n61\n00:03:19.962 --> 00:03:23.141\nBut if you've never used it\nbefore this is the show for you.\n\n62\n00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:26.603\nKnowing some of those basic windows,\nlike when to right click,\n\n63\n00:03:26.603 --> 00:03:30.912\ndouble clicking, your windows operating\nsystem, where is the start button.\n\n64\n00:03:30.912 --> 00:03:35.280\nThose are some things that would be\nprerequisite for this particular show.\n\n65\n00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.530\nAny extras,\nwell there's always other options\n\n66\n00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.490\nI might show you to do a specific\nfunction in outlook by clicking a button.\n\n67\n00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.778\nBut someone might come, do you know that\nyou could right click on that or do you\n\n68\n00:03:47.778 --> 00:03:51.086\nknow if you do a triple loop and stand on\nyour head you could do the same thing too.\n\n69\n00:03:51.086 --> 00:03:55.656\nYes, that is true there are lots of\ndifferent was to do the same thing in any\n\n70\n00:03:55.656 --> 00:03:59.160\nproduct and outlook is none the different.\n\n71\n00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.950\nUpdates happen,\nyes these products update all the time.\n\n72\n00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.809\nAnd so at the time your watching this show\nthere might have been a update that there\n\n73\n00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:12.325\nis a new button or\na new feature that is not covered in here.\n\n74\n00:04:12.325 --> 00:04:16.791\nWell that's because they're always doing\nthat with your Office365 subscription,\n\n75\n00:04:16.791 --> 00:04:20.899\nthat's the beauty of having a subscription\nbased product is that your constantly\n\n76\n00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.160\ngetting those updates.\n\n77\n00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.180\nI don't have all the answers for you but\n\n78\n00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.570\nthere is the wide world of internet out\nthere for you to search for your answers.\n\n79\n00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.889\nMicrosoft Office support websites they\nreally help you and they've shown us with\n\n80\n00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.222\neach ones of these episodes do have a lot\nof references to those particular sites.\n\n81\n00:04:40.222 --> 00:04:43.660\nThat Microsoft is not the only people\nthat know about their products.\n\n82\n00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.135\nSo definitely go ahead and\n\n83\n00:04:45.135 --> 00:04:50.042\nsearch that Internet to find that answer\nthat you're looking for, that's what I do.\n\n84\n00:04:50.042 --> 00:04:53.011\nEvery server is different,\nevery organization is different.\n\n85\n00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:58.004\nAnd every organization has different\nadministrative settings, and access,\n\n86\n00:04:58.004 --> 00:05:00.471\nand privileges, and group policies.\n\n87\n00:05:00.471 --> 00:05:03.930\nAnd we can start talking techie but\neverybody is different.\n\n88\n00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.550\nSo if there's something that I show in an\nepisode that you're like you click on it.\n\n89\n00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.125\nAnd like I don't even have\nthat option it's grayed out.\n\n90\n00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:13.957\nTalk to your IT people there might be\na reason of why you can't do that.\n\n91\n00:05:13.957 --> 00:05:17.108\nAnd of course above all\nhave fun with this.\n\n92\n00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:21.803\nI know it can get frustrating of not\nknowing why it's doing something or\n\n93\n00:05:21.803 --> 00:05:25.300\nnot doing something I\nexperience it all the time.\n\n94\n00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.280\nBut in the grand scheme of\nthings just keep an open mind,\n\n95\n00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.380\ntry to have fun with it.\n\n96\n00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.720\nBecause once you get familiar I think\nyou can know how to use a product.\n\n97\n00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.300\nOnce you know something it\nbecomes a lot more enjoyable.\n\n98\n00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.352\nSo with that I hope you have a great time\nin this episode, and I'll see you soon.\n\n99\n00:05:46.353 --> 00:05:49.376\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
