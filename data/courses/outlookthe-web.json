00:00:33.398\ntalk about the topics that we are going\nto be covering in this series.\n\n11\n00:00:33.398 --> 00:00:36.089\nWe're gonna start off with,\nwell, an introduction.\n\n12\n00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:38.590\nGonna be going over some terminology.\n\n13\n00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.533\nWhat is an email server,\nwhat is a pop, and what's an iMap?\n\n14\n00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:45.232\nAnd all of different things that you\nmight be hearing when people talk\n\n15\n00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:46.198\nabout emailing.\n\n16\n00:00:46.198 --> 00:00:48.736\nAnd especially some of those\nIT professionals that you\n\n17\n00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:50.820\nmight be working with in your help desk.\n\n18\n00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.064\nSo just gets you a little bit more\nfamiliar with the area of emailing,\n\n19\n00:00:55.064 --> 00:00:59.835\nan exchange servers, and Office 365 and\nfree accounts in Outlook.com.\n\n20\n00:00:59.835 --> 00:01:04.763\nSo we're also gonna be talking about\nthe interface of your mail in your\n\n21\n00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:07.890\nbrowser because this is out on the web.\n\n22\n00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.070\nSo we will be taking\nsome time to go ahead and\n\n23\n00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.779\ncompare and contrast between having\nthe Outlook in your web interface.\n\n24\n00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:20.090\nAnd then also your local ones with this\nshow is targeted to Outlook on the web.\n\n25\n00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.177\nI will also gonna go ahead and talk about\nyour account set-up which honestly,\n\n26\n00:01:23.177 --> 00:01:26.187\nthey're really isn't much set-up to\ndo because you're already online.\n\n27\n00:01:26.187 --> 00:01:28.290\nAnd so, that's kinda of the nice thing.\n\n28\n00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.780\nWe're also going to talk about\nsome emailing, all right.\n\n29\n00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.598\nThat's probably a lot with Outlook is\nknown for so we're going to send and\n\n30\n00:01:34.598 --> 00:01:35.740\nreceive emails.\n\n31\n00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.652\nWe're also gonna be\nformatting our messages.\n\n32\n00:01:37.652 --> 00:01:42.293\nWe're gonna go over how to organize and\ncustomize your Outlook environment and\n\n33\n00:01:42.293 --> 00:01:45.488\nhow to be best effective and\nefficient for your needs.\n\n34\n00:01:45.488 --> 00:01:48.170\nWe'll also talk about, ooh,\ngood old junk mail, right.\n\n35\n00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.436\nThat can always be a pain in our sides.\n\n36\n00:01:49.436 --> 00:01:51.761\nWe'll hopefully we'll try\nto alleviate that and\n\n37\n00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:55.930\nbe able to show you all the different\noptions you have through junk mail.\n\n38\n00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.767\nAnd we'll go over rules and\nautomation that can be really,\n\n39\n00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:00.708\nreally handy to making more efficient.\n\n40\n00:02:00.708 --> 00:02:02.470\nWe're also gonna talk about people.\n\n41\n00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.130\nNow if you're from back in the day,\nwhat are people?\n\n42\n00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.598\nIt's your contacts,\nthey're really the same thing.\n\n43\n00:02:07.598 --> 00:02:11.640\nWe'll be creating new contacts,\nwe'll be editing contacts.\n\n44\n00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.174\nAnd all the different things that you\ncan do within that particular area of\n\n45\n00:02:15.174 --> 00:02:16.145\nOutlook on the web.\n\n46\n00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:20.220\nAnd doing some comparing and\ncontrasting in that area, specifically,\n\n47\n00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.898\nbecause there are some decent amount of\ndifference between the local installation\n\n48\n00:02:24.898 --> 00:02:28.129\nthe online version that you\nhave in Outlook, on the web.\n\n49\n00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.910\nWe'll also talk about\nour wonderful calendar.\n\n50\n00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.303\nKeeping ourselves organized by creating\nappointments, creating meetings.\n\n51\n00:02:34.303 --> 00:02:38.491\nAnd then also being able to share\ncalendars within your organization.\n\n52\n00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:43.920\nAlso outside of your organization\nby going ahead and publishing it.\n\n53\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.480\nAnd then we have our other topic,\n\n54\n00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.995\nthat's where we're going\nto talk about some tasks.\n\n55\n00:02:47.995 --> 00:02:50.852\nAnd what you have on local installation\nwhich are known as notes and\n\n56\n00:02:50.852 --> 00:02:52.650\nwhere they are on the outlook for the web.\n\n57\n00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.243\nAnd any other miscellaneous items\nthat we would like to go ahead and\n\n58\n00:02:57.243 --> 00:03:00.943\ninclude we'll go ahead and\nput it in that other area.\n\n59\n00:03:00.943 --> 00:03:02.930\nNow who was this for?\n\n60\n00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.686\nIt's all Office users.\n\n61\n00:03:04.686 --> 00:03:09.403\nThis is Office with a capital O\nmean that you are using Office,\n\n62\n00:03:09.403 --> 00:03:11.560\nthe suite of application.\n\n63\n00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.218\nYou have either an Outlook, or\nsorry an Office 365 subscription,\n\n64\n00:03:15.218 --> 00:03:19.128\nyou have an account that you have paid\nfor, and have a paid version of that.\n\n65\n00:03:19.128 --> 00:03:26.240\nBut this show also covers the outlook.com,\nyour free version of using Outlook.\n\n66\n00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.359\nSo that's why we have Office,\nit doesn't mean, Office with a capital.\n\n67\n00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.072\nIt does not mean you have to\nbe In an office environment or\n\n68\n00:03:33.072 --> 00:03:38.760\nin a large organization, you can be in\nan organization of two, one, or 20000.\n\n69\n00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.160\nSo it doesn't matter what size of\nthe office that you physically obtain or\n\n70\n00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.570\nwhere you actually work from and\nuse Outlook.\n\n71\n00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.350\nBut you can see that I do\nhave using Outlook online.\n\n72\n00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.359\nSo this is where your gonna be\nusing the web interface and\n\n73\n00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.966\nnot the local installation.\n\n74\n00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:58.314\nIf you have access to it, that's great but\n\n75\n00:03:58.314 --> 00:04:02.434\nI do take it from the standpoint that\nyou're only gonna be using it online.\n\n76\n00:04:02.434 --> 00:04:04.367\nAnd yes I will compare and contrast but\n\n77\n00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:07.520\nthat's why we have this entire\nseries where out gone the web.\n\n78\n00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.495\nAnd this is for a basic user, I would\nsay taking from like some basic skills\n\n79\n00:04:12.495 --> 00:04:17.550\nup into an intermediate level of\nusing this particular product.\n\n80\n00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.664\nNow what do you need to\nknow before we get started?\n\n81\n00:04:19.664 --> 00:04:24.244\nHaving some Windows basics with your\noperating system is going to always be\n\n82\n00:04:24.244 --> 00:04:24.760\nhandy.\n\n83\n00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.205\nSo know where your start menu,\nyou know where your browsers,\n\n84\n00:04:27.205 --> 00:04:29.240\ndo you know what browser\nyou're going to be using.\n\n85\n00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.083\nAre you using Chrome,\nare you using Firefox?\n\n86\n00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:33.040\nAre using Edge?\n\n87\n00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.797\nAnd I actually kinda cover quite\na few of them, kinda jump back and\n\n88\n00:04:36.797 --> 00:04:41.388\nforth in between them with the different\nusers within this particular series.\n\n89\n00:04:41.388 --> 00:04:44.640\nWe're gonna be using our good\nold Justin and Joey and Lance.\n\n90\n00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.194\nIf you haven't watched any of\nmy other series, well get ready,\n\n91\n00:04:47.194 --> 00:04:48.150\nthey are coming at you.\n\n92\n00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.620\nAnd so that's where we're\ngoing to be using those.\n\n93\n00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.085\nSo having some familiarity\nwith some other Office\n\n94\n00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:58.710\nproducts is always a helpful leg up for\nyou but it's not required.\n\n95\n00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.068\nIf you've used Excel before,\nor you have Word,\n\n96\n00:05:01.068 --> 00:05:04.070\nyou know a little bit about\nOffice products, that's great.\n\n97\n00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.044\nOr maybe you've been using Google, or\nyou've been using Yahoo for your mail and\n\n98\n00:05:08.044 --> 00:05:10.682\nnow you're kind of familiar\nwith those interfaces.\n\n99\n00:05:10.682 --> 00:05:14.953\nThat might go ahead and give you a little\nbit of something to start with when you\n\n100\n00:05:14.953 --> 00:05:16.680\nstart using Outlook on Web.\n\n101\n00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.118\nBut again, not required.\n\n102\n00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:20.260\nI start from the very beginning and go on.\n\n103\n00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.825\nExtra things to always keep in mind,\nthere are always other options.\n\n104\n00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:30.327\nMaybe not as many of them on-line\nbecause of course this is a,\n\n105\n00:05:30.327 --> 00:05:36.730\nI would call almost like a slimmed down\nversion of what is capable within Outlook.\n\n106\n00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.535\nBecause it is on the web and\n\n107\n00:05:38.535 --> 00:05:42.322\nyou are limited to how\nthe browser is going to respond.\n\n108\n00:05:42.322 --> 00:05:45.475\nSo sometimes right clicking\nis not always going to work\n\n109\n00:05:45.475 --> 00:05:48.980\nin your low section of products,\nthat's always an option.\n\n110\n00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.165\nThere's usually like six or\nseven ways to do something.\n\n111\n00:05:51.165 --> 00:05:53.960\nMaybe here you might only have two or\nthree.\n\n112\n00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.676\nSo do keep that in mind, but\nthere could always be other ways of\n\n113\n00:05:57.676 --> 00:06:02.550\ngetting to perform different tasks, that\nI'm showing you the way I go about it.\n\n114\n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.530\nYou might have some other ways\nthat you might be able to do it.\n\n115\n00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.730\nAnd I did throw in here the browsers.\n\n116\n00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.372\nWhile there might not be too many\noptions it could make a difference of\n\n117\n00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:17.309\nwhether you're using Outlook\nthrough the Edge browser.\n\n118\n00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:22.304\nA Microsoft product, versus let's\nsay Chrome, or even if you're on\n\n119\n00:06:22.304 --> 00:06:27.234\na Mac with a Safari browser,\nthat could Have something to do with it.\n\n120\n00:06:27.234 --> 00:06:28.887\nIf you do any type of searching, and\n\n121\n00:06:28.887 --> 00:06:31.840\nyou can see that's one of my\nbullet points right there.\n\n122\n00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.465\nSearching for the answers, there's\nalways something that's gonna come up or\n\n123\n00:06:35.465 --> 00:06:36.774\nlike, why is it doing that?\n\n124\n00:06:36.774 --> 00:06:38.930\nYou go out and you search for the web.\n\n125\n00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.394\nAnd a lot of those forums that\ncome from the Microsoft Help,\n\n126\n00:06:41.394 --> 00:06:43.278\nthey'll be like what\nbrowser are you using?\n\n127\n00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:47.856\nThey're always gonna ask the people who\nare asking questions in those forums,\n\n128\n00:06:47.856 --> 00:06:51.970\ntell me what browser you're using\nbecause it could make a difference.\n\n129\n00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.691\nMaybe there are certain features that\nare not available within that particular\n\n130\n00:06:55.691 --> 00:06:57.757\nversion of the browser that you're using.\n\n131\n00:06:57.757 --> 00:07:02.190\nAnd another one that's always happening,\nupdates.\n\n132\n00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.404\nUpdates can throw things\nall out of whack sometimes.\n\n133\n00:07:04.404 --> 00:07:08.372\nThat's actually happened to me right in\nthe middle of one of my episodes where\n\n134\n00:07:08.372 --> 00:07:12.291\nthere's an Office update and\nit's completely reconfigured everything.\n\n135\n00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:15.000\nSo it could happen, it will happen.\n\n136\n00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.372\nAnd it might have some changes in what\nyou're looking at at the time that you're\n\n137\n00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:22.720\nwatching this as opposed to\nthe time that I did the tutorial.\n\n138\n00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.283\nAnd of course anytime we had any major\nchanges, we will always go ahead and\n\n139\n00:07:27.283 --> 00:07:29.720\nupdate those episodes for you.\n\n140\n00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.695\nAnd of course everybody has a different\nreason for using Outlook, and\n\n141\n00:07:32.695 --> 00:07:35.230\nyou might not use it the same\nway that somebody else uses it.\n\n142\n00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.887\nBut that's okay to eat its own,\nand so I wanna try and\n\n143\n00:07:37.887 --> 00:07:40.020\ngive you all the different options.\n\n144\n00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.694\nSo just keep that in mind, like I don't\nwanna use that feature, then don't,\n\n145\n00:07:43.694 --> 00:07:45.710\nit's okay, you use it to your advantage.\n\n146\n00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.286\nBut the most part, but the most\nimportant thing, try to have fun, or\n\n147\n00:07:49.286 --> 00:07:50.960\nat least watch these episodes.\n\n148\n00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.064\nWe try to keep it light, and\nhave some playing around and\n\n149\n00:07:54.064 --> 00:07:57.710\nmaking some jokes here and\nthere to try to keep your learning fun.\n\n150\n00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.138\nBecause I will tell you,\n\n151\n00:07:59.138 --> 00:08:02.950\nI get just as frustrated sometimes\nwhen something doesn't work.\n\n152\n00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.880\nAnd so that's where you have to kinda\nsit back and just kinda take a breath.\n\n153\n00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.107\nAnd make sure that you always say,\nthis will figure it's self out,\n\n154\n00:08:10.107 --> 00:08:14.350\nI will learn how to do this, and\njust have fun with everything.\n\n155\n00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.679\nAnd I hope to see you in some\nepisodes really, really soon.\n\n156\n00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:23.306\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.347 --> 00:00:12.566\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\nin today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:17.260\nwe're getting started with Outlook on the\nWeb and that may be a little confusing for\n\n5\n00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.440\nyou, but no worries,\nwe have the meister of Outlook.\n\n6\n00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.340\nAnd that's Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.355\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n8\n00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:25.420\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, and\nyou definitely hit the nail on the head.\n\n9\n00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.490\nMicrosoft can be a little confusing\nsometimes with how they label things and\n\n10\n00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.490\nhow they describe things and\nreally kind of use the same name for\n\n11\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.770\na lot of the same things.\n\n12\n00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.800\nSo I have a lovely PowerPoint presentation\nready for us to go through all\n\n13\n00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.830\nthe different things about Outlook on the\nweb and really just Outlook in general.\n\n14\n00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.120\nSo let's start here.\n\n15\n00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.250\nDo you remember your day planner, Justin?\n\n16\n00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.360\nDid you have one of those?\n\n17\n00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.205\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, no.\n\n18\n00:00:50.205 --> 00:00:52.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was a horrible planner,\n\n19\n00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.420\n&gt;&gt; prepper kind of individual, so\n\n20\n00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.580\nI was like day planner, throw that away.\n\n21\n00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.175\nI'm sorry, I was a horrible example.\n\n22\n00:00:58.175 --> 00:01:00.470\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well actually Justin,\n\n23\n00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.835\nI don't think I had one either.\n\n24\n00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:04.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I do remember then,\n\n25\n00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.770\nI know that a lot of people would\n&gt;&gt; take them with them,\n\n26\n00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.360\nand it was their thing.\n\n27\n00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.890\nThey had to have their day planner for\nwhatever they were doing,\n\n28\n00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.650\nbecause it kept you organized.\n\n29\n00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.920\nIt had things like your address book,\nooh, that's the wrong way,\n\n30\n00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.300\nhow about we go the other way.\n\n31\n00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.835\nThere we go.\n\n32\n00:01:19.835 --> 00:01:23.250\n[LAUGH] Learn the keyboard\n&gt;&gt; to move your Power Point presentation.\n\n33\n00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.060\nSo let's go down a slide.\n\n34\n00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.990\nAnd remember things like\nyour address book, and\n\n35\n00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.010\nyou had maybe like a to-do list in there,\nmaybe you carried some stamps around there\n\n36\n00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.240\nto have some envelopes to be able\nto go ahead and mail some things.\n\n37\n00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.711\nDo you remember that Rolodex there?\n\n38\n00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:38.780\nMan, Roladexes.\n\n39\n00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.340\nAll I know is I just like to spin them\nreally fast and see all the cards fly out.\n\n40\n00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.460\nI didn't really know what they were for\nat that point in time.\n\n41\n00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.360\n&gt;&gt; I remember doing that at\nmy parent's business, and\n\n42\n00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.090\nmy mom would get really mad at me because\nI would pull the cards out and all that.\n\n43\n00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.010\nAnd one with slider, remember the slider?\n\n44\n00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those were cool.\n\n45\n00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, with the metal one,\nyou pop it up, yeah.\n\n46\n00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.710\nThat was at my aunt's house.\n\n47\n00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.224\nShe didn't like that one so.\n\n48\n00:02:03.224 --> 00:02:07.455\n[LAUGH] But all of these different things\nwere the reason why people went ahead and\n\n49\n00:02:07.455 --> 00:02:11.010\ncarried your day planner around,\nbecause it kept you organized.\n\n50\n00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.390\nWho do I need to contact?\n\n51\n00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.770\nWhat do I need to do today?\n\n52\n00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.820\nWho do I need to send a letter to?\n\n53\n00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.990\nWell, that really is Outlook.\n\n54\n00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.780\nOkay, so\nOutlook is your digital day planner.\n\n55\n00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.490\nIt's where you do your email and\n\n56\n00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.690\nthat's probably a lot of people,\nmaybe in a collective knowledge,\n\n57\n00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.440\nassociate Outlook with the emailing,\nand that's exactly true.\n\n58\n00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.720\nBecause that's what you do, and that's\nwhat you use to go ahead and email people.\n\n59\n00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.610\nIt also stores all your contacts.\n\n60\n00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.880\nYou can have to-do lists.\n\n61\n00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.590\nYou have tasks.\n\n62\n00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.910\nYou have calendars,\nthe all important calendar and\n\n63\n00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.120\nyour schedule about where we're going and\nwhat we're doing.\n\n64\n00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.730\nAnd so this brand that Microsoft\nhas created as Outlook and\n\n65\n00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.160\nassociating itself with email is like\nwhat I said, a lot of people know about.\n\n66\n00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.610\nBut when you start getting into\nthe newer things that are going around\n\n67\n00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.598\non the internet,\nyou know we're talking about the internet.\n\n68\n00:03:04.598 --> 00:03:05.318\nEverything's online.\n\n69\n00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:06.635\nWe're talking about cloud computing,\n\n70\n00:03:06.635 --> 00:03:11.080\nwe're talking about cloud storage and\neverything is through our browsers and\n\n71\n00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.170\nnot necessarily through locally\ninstalled programs on our machine.\n\n72\n00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.170\nAnd so I think that's where\nthe confusion of, is this Outlook?\n\n73\n00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.560\nJust plain Outlook?\n\n74\n00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.970\nOr is this Outlook on the web?\n\n75\n00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.470\nOr is this Outlook.com?\n\n76\n00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.230\nOWA?\nWhat are all of these things?\n\n77\n00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.220\nThey all have the name Outlook in it.\n\n78\n00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.300\nBut they are slightly different.\n\n79\n00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.300\nSo let's go through some\nof the different brands and\n\n80\n00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.470\nthings that Microsoft has\nwith the word Outlook.\n\n81\n00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.750\nRight here, we have the regular Outlook\nlogo and this logo has been through so\n\n82\n00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.840\nmany iterations.\n\n83\n00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.740\nThey've gotten fancy, they went to the\nmetro look, they went to the flat design.\n\n84\n00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.900\nSo this is the most current Version of it.\n\n85\n00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.020\nIt looks like a little letter\npeeking out behind the door.\n\n86\n00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.550\nAnd then you have Outlook.com.\n\n87\n00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.180\nI also have over here some pictures\nof different logins that you see when\n\n88\n00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.750\nyou go to online, you go to a browser,\nand go ahead an log in.\n\n89\n00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.730\nAnd this is the key\ndifference here is that\n\n90\n00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.360\nare you going to Outlook\ngoing to your programs?\n\n91\n00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.960\nYou go to your start menu or your\nspotlight or whatever platform you’re on,\n\n92\n00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.360\nwhether a PC or Mac, and you’re going to\na program that is on the machine that is\n\n93\n00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.480\nlocally installed, that’s Outlook 2016.\n\n94\n00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.260\nSometimes, you refer to it as Outlook 365.\n\n95\n00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.595\nAnd that's where, again, I feel like\nI'm gonna start talking in circles.\n\n96\n00:04:33.595 --> 00:04:35.790\n[LAUGH] You know,\nbecause we have Outlook 365.\n\n97\n00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.740\nBut are you using the locally\ninstalled version or\n\n98\n00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.750\nare you using the online version?\n\n99\n00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.319\nNow that's different than Outlook.com.\n\n100\n00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:51.110\nOutlook.com is still online so\nwe're still going to a browser to be able\n\n101\n00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.000\nto get to that account, but\nthis one specifically is the free version.\n\n102\n00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000\nYour free account is\nnot tied to Office365.\n\n103\n00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.360\nSo if you have it,\nit's still a little confusing.\n\n104\n00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.710\nI still feel like I'm almost confusing\nmyself the more I talk about it.\n\n105\n00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne,\n\n106\n00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.880\nlet me just add to the confusion.\n\n107\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.640\nYou were saying Outlook so many times\nit kinda spurred along a little bit of\n\n108\n00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.650\na throwback from, I guess,\nmy teenage years.\n\n109\n00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.370\nWasn't there at one point\nlike an Outlook Express or\n\n110\n00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.680\nsomething like that that would've\nwent with all these other Outlooks?\n\n111\n00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.900\n&gt;&gt; You know, you threw another\none in the hat, didn't you?\n\n112\n00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.730\nYeah, another Outlook in the ring, yes.\n\n113\n00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.860\nIt is a little dated and\nI totally know what you're talking about,\n\n114\n00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.740\nbecause I remember that very well too.\n\n115\n00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.560\nOutlook Express was something that\nMicrosoft put in their operating\n\n116\n00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.140\nsystem when you bought a computer that\nhad your Windows operating system on it.\n\n117\n00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:50.100\nYou had Outlook Express as part of that\nOut, as part of your operating system.\n\n118\n00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.580\nAnd so you had that ready to go, but\n\n119\n00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.480\nit was like Outlook light,\nif you want to say.\n\n120\n00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.760\nIt was like the smaller version, and\nit wasn't the full-fledged version\n\n121\n00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.270\nof Outlook, whatever number and version\nthey are, whatever year they were in.\n\n122\n00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.000\nThat was like the full version that you,\nand\n\n123\n00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.900\nthe other thing was that\nyou had to purchase it.\n\n124\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.520\nSo this was almost like kind of\nwhere we are right here, right?\n\n125\n00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.240\nYou can buy Outlook 2016 either\nthrough a subscription or\n\n126\n00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.220\na stand-alone product buy or\n\n127\n00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.230\nif you had like the lighter version\nif you wanna say, Outlook.com or\n\n128\n00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.520\nwhat used to be Outlook Express,\nwhich used to be a lot of other things.\n\n129\n00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.850\nSo, yes, many, many words,\nsame words, different things,\n\n130\n00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.570\nmy favorite saying as I always say,\nthe same but different.\n\n131\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.020\nSo let's go ahead and go through\nsome of those, some of the details.\n\n132\n00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.630\nI've already kinda said some of it.\n\n133\n00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.990\nOutlook, Outlook 2016 as part\nof the Office 365 suite or\n\n134\n00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:50.120\na stand-alone purchase of that product,\nof that one application.\n\n135\n00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.250\nIt is locally installed on your computer.\n\n136\n00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.720\nSometimes I refer to this as\nthe desktop version of Outlook.\n\n137\n00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.350\nSo as you can see,\nit's downloaded to your computer.\n\n138\n00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.810\nIf you have that Office 365 account,\nyou go ahead and go online.\n\n139\n00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.190\nDownload the software, the application,\nput it on your computer and use it.\n\n140\n00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.690\nAnd it has the full features of Outlook.\n\n141\n00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.320\nA lot of large corporations,\nlarge organizations or\n\n142\n00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.110\neven smaller organizations,\nthey go ahead and use this system and\n\n143\n00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:23.430\nthey use Outlook on your desktop to be\nable to email, keep your calendars and so\n\n144\n00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:29.710\nit has a lot of features that you can take\nadvantage of by using the desktop version.\n\n145\n00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.090\nAs I said, it is also part of the Office\n365 suite of applications and\n\n146\n00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.400\nsubscriptions that you can buy.\n\n147\n00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.220\nThis is just a slide that has\na couple other products out there.\n\n148\n00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.140\nSome of them you might not have\nseen before maybe have ever even\n\n149\n00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.850\nknow how to even work with like Visio or\nInfoPath or Publisher.\n\n150\n00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:51.190\nAnd some of these are not even available\nfor certain product plans because there\n\n151\n00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:55.410\nare many different, many different product\nplans and subscriptions that you can\n\n152\n00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:00.340\nget in Office 365 whether it is for\nhome, business, education.\n\n153\n00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.540\nThen you have all the different business\nlevels, you have enterprise levels,\n\n154\n00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:05.970\nyou have personal.\n\n155\n00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:06.652\nThere's a lot.\n\n156\n00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:10.300\n[LAUGH] And this is where it can get\na little bit more confusing here.\n\n157\n00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.920\nIt's which product and\nwhat plan am I supposed to buy?\n\n158\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.540\nWell, they do have a very good\ncomparison on the website to where like\n\n159\n00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.560\nwhat do you need.\n\n160\n00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.260\nAnd really if you want to,\njust go ahead and\n\n161\n00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.230\nsearch for what office plan or\nwhat office subscription works for me.\n\n162\n00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.950\nAnd they do have a lot of articles out\nthere by people that will go ahead and\n\n163\n00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.630\nkind of break it down for you.\n\n164\n00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.080\nAnd you don't wanna buy something\nthat's bigger than you need.\n\n165\n00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.060\nYou just need to go ahead and\nget what you need.\n\n166\n00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.270\nThat was a nice closer.\n\n167\n00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.280\nI'm feeling everything.\n\n168\n00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.950\n&gt;&gt; That's from the department\nof redundancy department.\n\n169\n00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.440\nThose are some of my favorite things.\n\n170\n00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.230\nI do them too.\n\n171\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.960\nDon't worry about it.\n\n172\n00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.450\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\nSo here we are at Outlook.com.\n\n173\n00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.340\nBiggest difference here is that we´re\naccessing everything through your browser.\n\n174\n00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:57.320\nYou were going to your computer,\nclicking on whether it´s Microsoft Edge,\n\n175\n00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.415\nInternet Explorer, Chrome,\nFirefox, Safari, other ones.\n\n176\n00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:03.680\n[LAUGH] So we have other browsers, but\n\n177\n00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:10.020\nthe main thing is that you´re going to the\nweb to go ahead and access your account.\n\n178\n00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.790\nAnd I can see, we have,\nis it a free account, or\n\n179\n00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.190\nis it connected to a purchased\nsubscription plan?\n\n180\n00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.940\nAnd as I do have two different URL´s here,\n\n181\n00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.830\nbecause these are the two different\nlogins that you would use.\n\n182\n00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:27.790\nIf you are going to the Outlook.live.com,\nthat is your free version.\n\n183\n00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.870\nThat´s where you sign up for\nyour own account.\n\n184\n00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.920\nit's very similar to Gmail,\nwhere it's free.\n\n185\n00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.700\nI just want to sign up and\nthen make my email, and\n\n186\n00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.728\nthen I can go ahead and access my account.\n\n187\n00:09:37.728 --> 00:09:42.390\nThe login .Microsoft online,\nthat's the one where it's associated\n\n188\n00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.980\nwith an Office 365 account, and that might\nbe one that you have for your school or\n\n189\n00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:51.300\nfor your work or if you have purchased\nyour own particular subscription plan.\n\n190\n00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.740\nAnd now I have most features.\n\n191\n00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.850\nIt has most of the features of Outlook\nthat you could do if you had a fully\n\n192\n00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.190\ninstalled version locally\ninstalled on your computer.\n\n193\n00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:05.600\nBut it's still got most, not every single\npart, and a lot of times it's almost\n\n194\n00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.510\nlike It's almost like somebody went into\nyour kitchen and rearranged everything.\n\n195\n00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.652\nHave you ever had that done,\nwhere you go in and like, wait,\n\n196\n00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:13.390\nI keep going to that drawer with those\nspoons and they're not there anymore?\n\n197\n00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.620\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne, I hate to tell you,\n\n198\n00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.891\nif people are rearranging things in your\nkitchen, you should probably tell someone.\n\n199\n00:10:17.891 --> 00:10:20.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I understand what you're saying.\n\n200\n00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.532\nI'm like, this is the knives, I guess.\n\n201\n00:10:22.532 --> 00:10:23.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I thought it was the forks.\n\n202\n00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.690\nBut yeah, so there are different places.\n\n203\n00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:30.920\nAnd actually since I do some development\nwork between Windows and PC, I'll use\n\n204\n00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.920\nthe exact same application but then like\nthe settings will be under the Apple menu.\n\n205\n00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.066\nLike the actual application name.\n\n206\n00:10:38.066 --> 00:10:38.580\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n207\n00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.460\n&gt;&gt; And then on PC it might\nbe under the Edit menu,\n\n208\n00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.760\nlike edit settings instead of preferences.\n\n209\n00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.650\nSo you just gotta look a little bit,\nbut most of them are there.\n\n210\n00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.420\nNot always all of them.\n\n211\n00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.980\n&gt;&gt; You just have to go hunting\nin a different location.\n\n212\n00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:51.620\nExactly.\n\n213\n00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.720\nSo we have that here with Outlook.com.\n\n214\n00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.360\nAnd now I wanted to throw this slide in\ncuz we're talking about nostalgia here.\n\n215\n00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.330\nDo you remember Hotmail?\n\n216\n00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.540\n&gt;&gt; I do remember Hotmail.\n\n217\n00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:06.330\nI'm not gonna say I had some\nvery interesting Hotmail ads.\n\n218\n00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.710\nemail addresses, but that was all\nthe rage, you had to have a Hotmail.\n\n219\n00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.041\nSo I remember it fondly.\n\n220\n00:11:12.041 --> 00:11:12.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n221\n00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.620\nThen it was Hotmail, and then their was\nWindows Live, and then there was MSN,\n\n222\n00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.180\nbecause MSN was a part of it.\n\n223\n00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.690\nThey went through a couple\niterations of this, and\n\n224\n00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.361\nto where it has become Outlook.com.\n\n225\n00:11:24.361 --> 00:11:29.220\nIf you had a Hotmail or you still have\na Hotmail account and you're like, yeah,\n\n226\n00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:33.110\nI do know about this because they went\nahead and migrated me over to Outlook.com.\n\n227\n00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.760\nTalk about rearranging the kitchen again,\nright?\n\n228\n00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.770\nYou used to one interface using your\nYahoo and then they do some UX and\n\n229\n00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:43.210\nUI changes and what's going on?\n\n230\n00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:49.667\nUser interface and user experience\nis the two letters I just sent out.\n\n231\n00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:50.290\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n232\n00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.093\n&gt;&gt; And then now that is what Outlook.com\n\n233\n00:11:53.093 --> 00:11:54.330\nhas become.\n\n234\n00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.250\nIt is all the way through there.\n\n235\n00:11:56.250 --> 00:12:02.160\nAnd actually, in the show notes of this\nepisode and also in the actual PowerPoint,\n\n236\n00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:07.160\nthere's some links to some\nWikipedia articles that have some\n\n237\n00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:12.230\nreally interesting, like what they used to\nname something, and what the name is now.\n\n238\n00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:16.700\nAnd you can see all the different\niterations of what Microsoft has branded\n\n239\n00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:21.240\nall of their products, and\nwhat used to be the, that's what that was.\n\n240\n00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:26.500\nAnd so SkyDrive, that was the old name for\nOneDrive, and so, it's a little fun.\n\n241\n00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.650\nI kind of love that stuff anyways, so\n\n242\n00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.100\nI just wanted to throw\nthat out there to you.\n\n243\n00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.920\nNow, I didn't mention OWA,\nOutlook Web Access.\n\n244\n00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.791\nYou're like, okay this is access\nthrough the web browser so\n\n245\n00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:41.944\nit's the same thing as Outlook.com or\n\n246\n00:12:41.944 --> 00:12:47.674\nwhat I'm saying Outlook on the web,\n[SOUND] kind of if you're with OWA,\n\n247\n00:12:47.674 --> 00:12:53.432\nthis is specifically connected to\na Microsoft exchange server set up.\n\n248\n00:12:53.432 --> 00:12:58.926\nFor example, I used to work at a large\nuniversity, they weren't on Office 365.\n\n249\n00:12:58.926 --> 00:13:02.112\nThey still managed all their\nown exchange servers and\n\n250\n00:13:02.112 --> 00:13:07.400\nactive directories and then we had whole\nIT departments that set everything up.\n\n251\n00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.220\nSo this is what everything was.\n\n252\n00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:14.780\nIt still is, it's very much still\nin play and in production, but\n\n253\n00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.245\nwhat Microsoft with Office 365 is where\n\n254\n00:13:18.245 --> 00:13:22.705\nyou don't have to have somebody dedicated\nto building an entire exchange server.\n\n255\n00:13:22.705 --> 00:13:23.825\nIt's all there.\n\n256\n00:13:23.825 --> 00:13:28.682\nThat's one of the benefits of being on an\nOffice 365 account is that a lot of this\n\n257\n00:13:28.682 --> 00:13:33.002\nkinda higher level administrative\nstuff is kinda taken care of for you.\n\n258\n00:13:33.002 --> 00:13:37.122\nNow, there still are administrators and\nIT people that still need to manage it on\n\n259\n00:13:37.122 --> 00:13:40.882\na different level than you\nas an end user need to do.\n\n260\n00:13:40.882 --> 00:13:46.392\nBut I just wanted to kinda\nclarify that is OWA is\n\n261\n00:13:46.392 --> 00:13:50.970\nexchange specific like I don't want to say\nold exchange, because it's not that old.\n\n262\n00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.010\nWhen you say old,\nit seems like like dated.\n\n263\n00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.890\nIt's not entirely, but it's still there.\n\n264\n00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:59.250\nSo I wanted to go ahead and\nthrow that out there for you as well.\n\n265\n00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.890\nSo you have that clarification.\n\n266\n00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.899\nAnd if you are on OWA, and\nyou're watching these episodes,\n\n267\n00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:09.090\nagain that maybe the drawers\nare over on the left-hand side, but\n\n268\n00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:10.430\nI'm going to the right-hand side.\n\n269\n00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.025\nIts still all in there, but\n\n270\n00:14:13.025 --> 00:14:16.955\nit's just enough to be different\nto maybe be too different.\n\n271\n00:14:16.955 --> 00:14:19.030\n[LAUGH] So just keep that in mind.\n\n272\n00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:22.707\nAnd I am back to my terminology\nof this entire show,\n\n273\n00:14:22.707 --> 00:14:25.810\nits called Outlook on the Web.\n\n274\n00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.198\nWhere did I get that?\n\n275\n00:14:27.198 --> 00:14:32.154\nWell because it is all on the web, and\nwe are going to go through mostly through\n\n276\n00:14:32.154 --> 00:14:37.340\nan Office 365 account that is connected\nto my Office Pro Demo Co, where we're\n\n277\n00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:42.330\ngoing to be talking with Justin and\nJoey and Lance and using them as examples.\n\n278\n00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.840\nIf you watched any of my other shows,\nthey're the same people, so\n\n279\n00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.160\nwe're all on the same account.\n\n280\n00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.530\nSo this is where we're going\nto be mainly focused on.\n\n281\n00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:55.420\nAnd the Wikipedia articles,\nthey also refer to as Outlook on the Web.\n\n282\n00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.880\nAnd they say not to be\nconfused with Outlook.com.\n\n283\n00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.500\nI'm like don't, that's a little confusing.\n\n284\n00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.380\nBut free versus subscription based.\n\n285\n00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.040\nThat's mainly the biggest difference.\n\n286\n00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.570\nNotice here Outlook on the Web.\n\n287\n00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.360\nWe, I do have a free account\nthat I have created for\n\n288\n00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.170\nmyself to be able to demonstrate\nsome of the differences.\n\n289\n00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.780\nWe might jump over from here to there in\nsome of these episodes and be like, okay,\n\n290\n00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:24.490\nso the regular Outlook.com accounts,\nthis is what you'll see and\n\n291\n00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:29.130\nyou might not have as many features\nas one that has a subscription based.\n\n292\n00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:35.530\nSo, that is the the origination\nof my show title.\n\n293\n00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.195\nOur setup, what are we going to be using?\n\n294\n00:15:37.195 --> 00:15:39.980\nWe're going to be on a Windows\n10 operating system.\n\n295\n00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.970\nWe are going to be using Microsoft Edge\nas our browser for the most part.\n\n296\n00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:50.630\nThis account is part of an Office 365\nProPlus account so I might have some\n\n297\n00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:54.390\nfeatures when I go in to the admin like\nthey're kinda the back end of the account.\n\n298\n00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.830\nIt might look a little different\nthan yours possibly and\n\n299\n00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:01.330\nlike I said Outlook.com account\nis well in this episodes.\n\n300\n00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.992\nWe will be able to throw this in here and\nthere.\n\n301\n00:16:03.992 --> 00:16:07.910\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne,\nthis is the first time that someone's like\n\n302\n00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:11.045\nwe're gonna use Microsoft Edge and\na development of community.\n\n303\n00:16:11.045 --> 00:16:13.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We stay away from those products\n\n304\n00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:14.070\n&gt;&gt; But with that said,\n\n305\n00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.000\nif somebody has a preferred browser or\n\n306\n00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.370\nif they wanna be on a Mac, are there\ngonna be any issues that come up?\n\n307\n00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.990\nI know you touched on it a little bit.\n\n308\n00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.360\nBut should we be aware?\n\n309\n00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.850\nIt shouldn't be different.\n\n310\n00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:25.514\nBut could it be?\n\n311\n00:16:25.514 --> 00:16:26.444\n&gt;&gt; Possibly?\n\n312\n00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:28.894\n[LAUGH] Very possibly.\n\n313\n00:16:28.894 --> 00:16:35.000\nBut the beauty of having\na web-based email client is that\n\n314\n00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.170\nit should look the same whether you're\nusing Chrome or Firefox or PC or Mac.\n\n315\n00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:43.610\nI know that I have a Mac\ncomputer right here, but\n\n316\n00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.190\nI'm on a Windows operating\nsystem in a virtual machine.\n\n317\n00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:50.030\nSo I am in and out of browsers, platforms,\n\n318\n00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:54.130\nbut I still go ahead and\naccess our own ITPRO.TV email.\n\n319\n00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:58.520\nI go through the web portal,\nif you want to say, through my account.\n\n320\n00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:03.780\nAnd it's pretty much the same throughout\neverything, so you shouldn't with a little\n\n321\n00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:08.740\nasterisk on there, you shouldn't have any\ndifferences so and that talking about your\n\n322\n00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:12.500\nsetup, as long as you're accessing\nit through some type of browser and\n\n323\n00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:17.590\nI love you Microsoft, but I'm kind of\nwith you there on the Microsoft Edge.\n\n324\n00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:22.380\nI do some coding as well and\nyou kind of, you pick your flavor.\n\n325\n00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.710\nAnd I'm sure somebody's gonna\nhave some other type of something\n\n326\n00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:28.220\nto say about no don't do that, use this.\n\n327\n00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:32.340\nSo to each his own and\neverybody has their own flavor.\n\n328\n00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.820\nSo whether it's for work or personal or\n\n329\n00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:39.320\nthat OWA,\nit should all be mostly the same.\n\n330\n00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.060\nYou will have to talk to your particular\n\n331\n00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:45.370\nIT department about how\nyour network is set up.\n\n332\n00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:48.370\nBecause when you have a large\norganization, some would like to go ahead\n\n333\n00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:52.920\nand put in certain restrictions,or group\npolicies or things that like okay,\n\n334\n00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.360\nwell you're not allowed to do that because\nwe just don't allow that on our network.\n\n335\n00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.050\nEverybody has different levels of\nsecurity, different organizations, whether\n\n336\n00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:05.490\nit's for government work or anything with\npublic sector versus the private sector.\n\n337\n00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.240\nSo just go ahead and\ntalk to the people and say, hey,\n\n338\n00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.780\nI saw this on this OfficeProTV.\n\n339\n00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.100\nWhy can't I do it?\n\n340\n00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.109\nAnd they'll probably say,\nwell, you just can't.\n\n341\n00:18:13.109 --> 00:18:16.130\n[LAUGH] But it could come up.\n\n342\n00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:19.482\nSo I believe that is\nthe end of the slide show.\n\n343\n00:18:19.482 --> 00:18:21.505\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, definitely thank you for\n\n344\n00:18:21.505 --> 00:18:26.375\nhelping us navigate through the Outlook\nforests [LAUGH] how we call it.\n\n345\n00:18:26.375 --> 00:18:29.705\nI am kind of excited,\nbecause I know I've been trying to do some\n\n346\n00:18:29.705 --> 00:18:33.002\nmore advanced email features\nthrough the web-based clients,\n\n347\n00:18:33.002 --> 00:18:37.285\nand not quite got them to work, so\nI'm ready, and hopefully you are as well,\n\n348\n00:18:37.285 --> 00:18:39.300\nbut we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up this episode.\n\n349\n00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.290\nBut join us back for more Outlook.\n\n350\n00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:42.470\nSigning off for OfficePro TV.\n\n351\n00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.120\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n352\n00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.070\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n353\n00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:49.190\n&gt;&gt; See you next time.\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.070\nI'm your host Justin Dennison,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.580\nwell, we're continuing on with Outlook for\nthe Web, and more specifically,\n\n5\n00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.680\nwe're gonna look at some of these terms\nthat you should know, I should know, and\n\n6\n00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.110\nwell, everybody should know before\nembarking on our Outlook adventure.\n\n7\n00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.200\nAnd here to help us with that is none\nother than the Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.971\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:30.130\n&gt;&gt; I'm great, and so\nready to talk about letters.\n\n10\n00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.550\nYes, seriously, we're gonna be\ntalking about acronyms today and\n\n11\n00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.521\ngoing through all of the different things\nthat are associated with emailing.\n\n12\n00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:41.956\nAnd these are the things that you might\nhave seen throughout your adventures in\n\n13\n00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:46.794\nthe world of emailing, throughout the\ndifferent email addresses that you've had,\n\n14\n00:00:46.794 --> 00:00:50.415\nso hopefully,\nwe're gonna clarify some of these things.\n\n15\n00:00:50.415 --> 00:00:52.895\nAnd just at least, again,\nit's just a foundational knowledge.\n\n16\n00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:58.225\nWe're not going to go into the\nsuper-depths of being all techy, I know\n\n17\n00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:01.465\nthere's a lot of people running around\nhere that are always talking about tech.\n\n18\n00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:03.832\nAnd I, but to throw out all of\nthese letters, and I'm like,\n\n19\n00:01:03.832 --> 00:01:04.860\nwhat does that stand for?\n\n20\n00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.346\nAnd they're like,\nI don't remember [LAUGH].\n\n21\n00:01:08.346 --> 00:01:13.160\nLike HTML and DOM and JS,\nand I'm like, what is that?\n\n22\n00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.630\n&gt;&gt; You know Vonne I can provide\nsome different context for that.\n\n23\n00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.580\nYou know what I think\nthe acronyms are for?\n\n24\n00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.370\nYes they make some long verbage simpler\nbut also they make you feel smart.\n\n25\n00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.760\nI think that's really the biggest reason\nfor it is, if I can say a bunch of\n\n26\n00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.960\nacronyms in front of someone and they just\nglaze over like yes, I'm intelligent and\n\n27\n00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.420\nI think that's really the take away for\nall these acronyms.\n\n28\n00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.320\n&gt;&gt; I do love to speak like that.\n\n29\n00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.060\nYeah, the kind of glaze over and\nthen somebody ask me, and I'm like, God,\n\n30\n00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.543\nI just turned into one of them.\n\n31\n00:01:41.543 --> 00:01:44.338\nI don't remember what it stands for, so.\n\n32\n00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:46.808\nBut that's okay, you know what,\nthat's why we have notes.\n\n33\n00:01:46.808 --> 00:01:49.603\n[LAUGH] Because I don't\nremember all of them either.\n\n34\n00:01:49.603 --> 00:01:54.679\nSo, definitely confer, consult,\ngo look at the show notes and\n\n35\n00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.950\nI will be using them as well as we\ngo through the email terminology.\n\n36\n00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.270\nHave another PowerPoint\npresentation ready to go.\n\n37\n00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.060\nSo let's jump in and\ntalk about these words and\n\n38\n00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.160\nletters and talking about protocols.\n\n39\n00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.597\nAnd a protocol is a system of rules and\ntelecommunications that allows two or\n\n40\n00:02:13.597 --> 00:02:18.313\nmore entities of communications systems\nto transmit information via any kind of\n\n41\n00:02:18.313 --> 00:02:20.416\nvariation of a physical quantity.\n\n42\n00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:22.335\nOoh, my goodness gracious, really?\n\n43\n00:02:22.335 --> 00:02:25.770\n[LAUGH] I know, right, that kinda\nhurt my brain a little bit there.\n\n44\n00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.898\nBut, yes, luckily,\nI'm reading it off a piece of paper.\n\n45\n00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:33.190\nSo what is, a protocol is just\nsomething that we've all determined and\n\n46\n00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.190\nwhen we say we all, there's governing\nbodies out there that went ahead\n\n47\n00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.930\ncreated these different protocols and\nsay that all of us here in computer world,\n\n48\n00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.300\nwe are gonna start using them.\n\n49\n00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.470\nSo we are going to jump through a few of\nthem but I would like to start at the very\n\n50\n00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.740\nvery beginning of let's clarify,\nwhat is a client?\n\n51\n00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.730\nWhat is a server?\n\n52\n00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.150\nI like to think of servers almost\nlike a server at a restaurant.\n\n53\n00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.200\nWhat is their job?\n\n54\n00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.150\nIt's to serve the clients.\n\n55\n00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.110\nLook at that right?\n\n56\n00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.860\nOr the customers here, and so\nthey act between maybe the kitchen and\n\n57\n00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.720\nmaybe the bar and then you go ahead and\nask them for things and they go ahead and\n\n58\n00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.500\ngrab it and then give it back to you.\n\n59\n00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.380\nSo it's kind of like that\nin computers as well.\n\n60\n00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.970\nA server, it's still a computer, just\nlike your client, that's a computer, but\n\n61\n00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.500\nthey serve different functions.\n\n62\n00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.560\nA server is going to serve up files.\n\n63\n00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.710\nIt'll serve up email, it'll serve\nup the network, if you wanna say,\n\n64\n00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.900\nof your directories.\n\n65\n00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.570\nIt is the thing that all of\nyou as a client-based operator\n\n66\n00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.210\nyou talk to in most cases.\n\n67\n00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.157\nNow that doesn't mean everybody talks\nto a server but if you're emailing,\n\n68\n00:03:46.157 --> 00:03:48.783\nwhether it is through Outlook or Gmail or\n\n69\n00:03:48.783 --> 00:03:53.653\nany other type of email based thing\nwe'll call it for lack of better terms,\n\n70\n00:03:53.653 --> 00:03:58.089\nyou are connecting and communicating\nwith the server of some sort.\n\n71\n00:03:58.089 --> 00:04:02.148\nSo whether it's built on your premise or\nit's out in the cloud,\n\n72\n00:04:02.148 --> 00:04:06.990\nthere is something out there that\nyou talk to as you as a computer.\n\n73\n00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.210\n&gt;&gt; It's funny that you bring up that\nanalogy because that's something\n\n74\n00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.130\nI explained when we build software servers\nwhen I'm teaching other things but\n\n75\n00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.340\nto really drive that home, I like to think\nof the protocol in that instance is, well\n\n76\n00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.620\nif you went and sat down in a restaurant,\nand your server came up to you and spoke\n\n77\n00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.200\na completely different language, then\nyour ability to request things, right.\n\n78\n00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.670\nI need a fork, and they're just like,\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n79\n00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.900\nThen you don't have that interface\nbetween the server and the client.\n\n80\n00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.200\nSo they have to speak\nthe same language and\n\n81\n00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.460\nit has to be pre agreed upon and I think\nthat's what helps me internalize protocol.\n\n82\n00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.400\nIs it technically correct?\n\n83\n00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.030\nIt could be iffy but it is helpful for\nme to reason about these things.\n\n84\n00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.215\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I love that correlation of like,\nthis is, they're languages, and\n\n85\n00:04:53.215 --> 00:04:56.524\nif we're talking English\nversus Spanish versus French,\n\n86\n00:04:56.524 --> 00:05:01.000\nso as long as we know, okay let me\nswitch and talk in that language.\n\n87\n00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.250\nAnd so that's a great analogy for how all\nof this stuff in computers really work,\n\n88\n00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.360\nwork in, work for, work with, all of that.\n\n89\n00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.600\nSo we are a client, and we're gonna\nbe talking with a email server.\n\n90\n00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.690\nNow these protocols.\n\n91\n00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.960\nWe have POP, IMAP, Exchange, and SMTP.\n\n92\n00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.671\nI say Exchange with this weird kind of\ninflection in there because it's, it is,\n\n93\n00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:32.390\nI'm not sure if we've seen how it starting\nto go in that circle again, right?\n\n94\n00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.387\nIs it a protocol?\n\n95\n00:05:33.387 --> 00:05:37.275\nBut I went ahead and threw it in here\nbecause we are talking about different\n\n96\n00:05:37.275 --> 00:05:39.797\nthings associated with emailing,\nall right?\n\n97\n00:05:39.797 --> 00:05:43.967\nAnd so you can see POP and\nPOP3 is post office protocol,\n\n98\n00:05:43.967 --> 00:05:49.118\nit's an application layer\nInternet Standard Protocol used by local\n\n99\n00:05:49.118 --> 00:05:55.640\nemail clients to retrieve email from\na remote server over TCPIP connection.\n\n100\n00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.940\nOkay, I threw out some more letters.\n\n101\n00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.836\nTCP is transmission control protocol,\nand the internet protocol.\n\n102\n00:06:01.836 --> 00:06:04.430\nRemember that I was talking\nabout the languages?\n\n103\n00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.591\nOr even back on our phones right,\nyou have to pick up the phone and\n\n104\n00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:08.632\nyou get a dial tone, and\nthen you have to type in the number and\n\n105\n00:06:08.632 --> 00:06:10.660\nthen it goes out to another and\nthat switch board operates.\n\n106\n00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.542\nI mean you can kind of think back to all\nof these different ways of how incoming\n\n107\n00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:19.128\nand outgoing messages go,\nwhether through the phone,\n\n108\n00:06:19.128 --> 00:06:24.340\nthrough the snail mail as we call it now,\nthe post office, post office, right.\n\n109\n00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.870\nSo all of these words kinda come\nfrom that is it going in or\n\n110\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.028\nis it going out when talking\nabout these messages.\n\n111\n00:06:32.028 --> 00:06:35.494\nAnd Exchange kinda uses all of this and\n\n112\n00:06:35.494 --> 00:06:40.702\nthen there's that simple\nmail transfer protocol SMTP.\n\n113\n00:06:40.702 --> 00:06:44.548\nI think the next slide is really going\nto clarify some of this, which I said,\n\n114\n00:06:44.548 --> 00:06:45.884\nincoming and outcoming.\n\n115\n00:06:45.884 --> 00:06:49.510\nSo, POP3 and IMAP are, they are kinda like\n\n116\n00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:54.120\ndifferent dialects we'll say,\nof the same language.\n\n117\n00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.510\nOkay, they're different\nflavors of the same ice cream.\n\n118\n00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.940\nWell yeah, yeah, okay.\n\n119\n00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me further clarify, I mean, I get\n\n120\n00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.740\nmade fun of a little bit because sometimes\nmy southern twang comes out, right.\n\n121\n00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.900\nI'm still speaking English,\nbut if I go full on in a,\n\n122\n00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.550\npeople are like,\nI don't know what you're saying.\n\n123\n00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.720\nBut it's still English,\n\n124\n00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.080\nand as long as you can understand that,\nyou get the same results.\n\n125\n00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.560\nAnd just to emphasize,\n\n126\n00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.550\na protocol is an agreed upon\ninterface of how you interact, right?\n\n127\n00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.570\nIf the push versus pull doors,\n\n128\n00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.100\nif you ever went up to those, you're like,\naw, this is a push handle and\n\n129\n00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.560\nyou find out it's a pull handle and\nit's not designed appropriately.\n\n130\n00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.080\nWell, you just need to know that\nthe established agreed upon language or\n\n131\n00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.400\ninterface and what I mean by interface\nis how you interact with said thing.\n\n132\n00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.120\nSo you have to keep that in mind and\nwhatever model who work for\n\n133\n00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.595\nyou, well\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n134\n00:07:49.595 --> 00:07:50.750\n&gt;&gt; Just reason about it right?\n\n135\n00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.598\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n136\n00:07:51.598 --> 00:07:54.250\nAnd you're like, well I don't know\nif I'm supposed to use POP or IMAP,\n\n137\n00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.001\na lot of this is determined for\nyou, honestly.\n\n138\n00:07:56.001 --> 00:07:58.894\n[LAUGH] Especially if you're in\nan organization that everybody's managing\n\n139\n00:07:58.894 --> 00:07:59.700\nthis for you.\n\n140\n00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.660\nThat's fine.\n\n141\n00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:08.680\nBut there's also like, I know this from\nwhen I had to set up my email on my phone.\n\n142\n00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.570\nAnd this was like awhile ago, or\n\n143\n00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:16.210\nmaybe on the Outlook Express that we\nhad mentioned in our introduction,\n\n144\n00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:21.990\nto where you had to configure,\nyou had to know the address for\n\n145\n00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.860\nyour POP mail and your SMTP mail.\n\n146\n00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:30.860\nSo whatever software or\nphone device you had to say,\n\n147\n00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.530\nhey if I'm using around this area\nthere's Cox communication and\n\n148\n00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:39.710\nso I had a Cox communication\nemail address, and so\n\n149\n00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:45.010\nI had to go to their website and\nlook up their POP and\n\n150\n00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:50.180\nSMTP URLs,\nthose addresses to where my phone\n\n151\n00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.630\nknew how to bring my mail into my phone\nand how it could send the mail out.\n\n152\n00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:59.910\nAnd so this is where you're gonna see a\nlot of these letters and these protocols.\n\n153\n00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:05.000\nWhen setting up emails from\ndifferent communication companies or\n\n154\n00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.200\ndifferent providers, and you want Outlook\nto manage them, you might need to find\n\n155\n00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.440\nthese settings from whoever is providing\nyou that particular email address.\n\n156\n00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.640\nNow the cool thing is, a lot of this,\nlike I said, it does it for you.\n\n157\n00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.090\nNow you just type in, especially if\nyou're in the local version of Outlook,\n\n158\n00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.495\nyou just type it in, boop,\nit does it all for you.\n\n159\n00:09:24.495 --> 00:09:28.270\nThat you might have to go into some\nof those advanced settings and\n\n160\n00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.280\nbe able to make sure it knows.\n\n161\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.360\nIt being whatever client\nyou're working with,\n\n162\n00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.660\nlike Outlook knows where it's coming in.\n\n163\n00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.070\nAnd the same is gonna be for Outlook for\nweb, because you can use it to configure\n\n164\n00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.960\nyour Gmail, or your Yahoo account,\nyou could have outlook.com,\n\n165\n00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.480\nor your Office 365 Outlook to go ahead and\ndo that for you.\n\n166\n00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:55.340\nSo understanding at least what the letter\nstand for, and where you can find them for\n\n167\n00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.410\nyour provider, and what you're\nlooking for, that's half the battle.\n\n168\n00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:04.310\nYou don't need to know much past it's\nan internet standard protocol by your\n\n169\n00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.740\napplication layer within the OSI model.\n\n170\n00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.763\nSee, I actually do not\nknow what that means,\n\n171\n00:10:08.763 --> 00:10:10.531\nthat's about as far as I know about it.\n\n172\n00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:12.592\nThrowing out those terminology,\n\n173\n00:10:12.592 --> 00:10:16.650\nyou don't have to go that deep just\nhave this basic understanding.\n\n174\n00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:22.466\nNow, this slide,\nEmail Clients versus Webmail.\n\n175\n00:10:22.466 --> 00:10:28.038\nEmail clients such as Outlook 2016, that\nis locally installed on your computer,\n\n176\n00:10:28.038 --> 00:10:31.623\nthat you have to tell that\nsoftware how the SMTP and POP,\n\n177\n00:10:31.623 --> 00:10:34.979\nor IMAP is going to be configured,\nversus Webmail,\n\n178\n00:10:34.979 --> 00:10:39.720\nwhich is what this show is about,\nwe are doing Outlook on the web.\n\n179\n00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.650\nWell with a Outlook, for\n\n180\n00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.130\nthe Webmail you don't even have to\ngo into that whole configuration.\n\n181\n00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:47.350\nIt's almost like you're going\nto the direct to the source, so\n\n182\n00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:50.098\nit's just there so\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n183\n00:10:50.098 --> 00:10:52.570\nIt's like of then why are we\ngoing over all this terminology?\n\n184\n00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.940\nBecause it can be\nconfigured to go ahead and\n\n185\n00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.810\nget your other email from other providers,\nlike I had mentioned earlier.\n\n186\n00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.150\nBut I just wanted to clarify\nthis a little bit more.\n\n187\n00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:07.370\n&gt;&gt; And it is good to know this because\nI've run into this when I hadn't,\n\n188\n00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.170\nI started signing up for\nemail addresses, I had like 30 of them.\n\n189\n00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.120\nAnd I was like this is getting unruly,\nI need some way to manage this and\n\n190\n00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.410\nI wasn't using a local client and I wanted\nto forward them to my various emails.\n\n191\n00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:21.635\nI remember having to search\na great deal like, what is a POP3?\n\n192\n00:11:21.635 --> 00:11:26.860\nLike this was, this ass a little while\nago, but I eventually was able to take\n\n193\n00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:32.340\na little bit of terminology and make the\nright searches in the documentation to go,\n\n194\n00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.230\nthey're using IMAP or they're using POP3.\n\n195\n00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.300\nAnd then I finally had everything.\n\n196\n00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.793\nSo it's good to know what those are,\njust so you're not like, well,\n\n197\n00:11:40.793 --> 00:11:43.413\nI'm gonna take a nap now and\njust forget about this.\n\n198\n00:11:43.413 --> 00:11:46.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's like,\nI don't even know where to start.\n\n199\n00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.391\nOr sometimes I would spell words so\nwrong it's like, I don't even, I can't\n\n200\n00:11:50.391 --> 00:11:54.703\neven close to getting the spellcheck to\neven recognize a word I'm trying to do.\n\n201\n00:11:54.703 --> 00:11:56.870\nSo [LAUGH] half the battle.\n\n202\n00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.320\nLet's go through some of the examples.\n\n203\n00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.630\nWhat is the difference between POP and\nIMAP because there on\n\n204\n00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.030\nthe right hand side on that slide\nthey were all about incoming.\n\n205\n00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:09.140\nSo I have little diagram here of\nthe server which is on the left and\n\n206\n00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.770\nthen the client which is on the right.\n\n207\n00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:16.020\nSo what you do is the server,\nyour email provider will go ahead and\n\n208\n00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:21.110\nhave the mail come down into your client\nand so everything kind of get pushed down.\n\n209\n00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:25.150\nWell, the big difference here is you\ncan see like if I'm on my phone or\n\n210\n00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:30.800\nI'm on my computer and\nI delete an email on that program,\n\n211\n00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.640\nthat software that I'm using,\nthe email stays in the server.\n\n212\n00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.378\nSo it never is deleted off the server.\n\n213\n00:12:36.378 --> 00:12:39.230\nIt's a one-way communication.\n\n214\n00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:43.420\nOnce the mail comes into\nyour client it's yours,\n\n215\n00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.840\nyou can figure out however\nyou want to do it.\n\n216\n00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:49.080\nYou can delete it all, you can move it all\naround, but the server is still gonna have\n\n217\n00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.060\nthat copy over there because it's like I\npush it down, we're not talking anymore.\n\n218\n00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.590\nYou do you, and I'm gonna stay\nover here and continue to do me.\n\n219\n00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.090\nSo that's what POP3 does.\n\n220\n00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:03.020\nLet's do the variation\nhere on what IMAP does.\n\n221\n00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.200\nSo I have a server on the left and\nI have actually a phone,\n\n222\n00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:10.290\nthat's a phone by the way, and\na client over here, because I might have\n\n223\n00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:15.760\nit to where it's at work or on my computer\nat home, but I also have my phone.\n\n224\n00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.790\nSo everything's down here,\nnotice the arrows here.\n\n225\n00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:24.890\nThey go both ways, because let's say I\nwent ahead and deleted an email on my\n\n226\n00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:30.410\nclient which would be my desktop,\nit deletes that email off the server.\n\n227\n00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:34.210\nSo it's always communicating\nwith each other and syncing,\n\n228\n00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:38.430\nif you wanna say, to where everything,\nall of your devices, will go ahead and\n\n229\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:42.190\nconnect together, and\neverybody's talking on the same page.\n\n230\n00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:46.070\nSo that's the big difference\nbetween POP versus IMAP.\n\n231\n00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:46.910\nNow which one's better?\n\n232\n00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:50.420\nIt really depends on how\nyou need to use your email.\n\n233\n00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.694\nThe POP, there is something kind of,\nlike a safety net,\n\n234\n00:13:53.694 --> 00:13:56.450\nthat's like it's never gonna be\ndeleted off your server with POP.\n\n235\n00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:57.140\nWith IMAP,\n\n236\n00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.700\nif you hit the wrong button, you know,\nit's gonna be deleted on the server.\n\n237\n00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.090\nSo there's a direct connection between\nthat with this particular protocol.\n\n238\n00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:08.460\n&gt;&gt; I can see this as more of a, like\na retail if you will oriented type thing,\n\n239\n00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.240\nlike you will IMAP so everything stays\nin sync but from a business aspect,\n\n240\n00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.470\nI could see hey we will always\nwanna a copy on the server.\n\n241\n00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:19.110\nEspecially if you have certain\nrequirements for retention of data, and\n\n242\n00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.980\nthings of that nature.\n\n243\n00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:24.400\nI know in some states they have laws where\nyou can always public records request\n\n244\n00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.070\nall emails.\n\n245\n00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.180\nSo, you have to have those available, and\n\n246\n00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.630\nif I was allowed to make the decision to\ndelete them everywhere, well it would be\n\n247\n00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.950\nhard to comply with state requirements and\nthen it can be a lot of trouble.\n\n248\n00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:40.150\nSo, the choice of those is\na use case based decision.\n\n249\n00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.110\n&gt;&gt; And\nI think those are excellent examples.\n\n250\n00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.415\nI couldn't have said it better myself,\nJustin.\n\n251\n00:14:44.415 --> 00:14:46.600\n[LAUGH] Well, thank you so much.\n\n252\n00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:51.170\nSo I mentioned exchange in there,\nI threw that in there, and\n\n253\n00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.580\nExchange isn't necessarily a protocol.\n\n254\n00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:59.330\nActually, it works on a MAPI or MAPI,\n\n255\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:04.308\nwhichever one you wanna say, a Messaging\nApplication Programing Interface and\n\n256\n00:15:04.308 --> 00:15:06.490\nit is a messaging architecture and\n\n257\n00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:11.960\na Component Object Model based API,\nmy gosh I'm done.\n\n258\n00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.220\nAgain, it's that,\nit's that type of protocol or\n\n259\n00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:19.910\nterminology or technology when\nsay that Exchange is built on.\n\n260\n00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:23.340\nExchange is very Microsoft centric, okay.\n\n261\n00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:27.850\nYou have in a Microsoft Exchange Server\nand everybody talks all the clients.\n\n262\n00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:31.930\nAnd you can see that little trapezoid that\nI have drawn here on this slide is that\n\n263\n00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:36.390\nthere are certain things that people that\nare on the same Exchange Server that can\n\n264\n00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.720\ndo with communicating between each other.\n\n265\n00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.720\nThen different,\nthen if you're on just a POP or an IMAP.\n\n266\n00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.830\nSo it's kind of like a closed\ncircuit if you wanna to say.\n\n267\n00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.550\nThe special in crowd.\n\n268\n00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:54.380\nIf you're in an Exchange environment,\nyou can talk to each other in certain ways\n\n269\n00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:59.620\nif you wanna say that might be different\nif talking without people outside of it.\n\n270\n00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.840\nBack at the university,\nI could send really large attachments to\n\n271\n00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.950\nsomebody else in the Exchange\nenvironment because that was fine.\n\n272\n00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.630\nOutside of it,\nif I had someone that was using Gmail or\n\n273\n00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:13.270\nYahoo, they might have different\nsize limitations and so\n\n274\n00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:18.030\nI wouldn't be able to send them\ncertain attachments of a certain size.\n\n275\n00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:22.980\nExchange has a lot of kind of inside\ncircle stuff that they can, like I said,\n\n276\n00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.240\ntalk with each other,\nthat they couldn't do with outside people.\n\n277\n00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:30.820\nSo it's very Exchange based,\nvery Microsoft centric.\n\n278\n00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.380\nAnd so, that's why I wanted\nto throw Exchanges, and\n\n279\n00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.490\nyou get into active directory and\nall sorts of different fun stuff that\n\n280\n00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:41.021\nI'm just gonna say active directory\nbecause I know it exists.\n\n281\n00:16:41.021 --> 00:16:45.850\n[LAUGH] I wouldn't know the first thing\nabout managing it, but it can be done.\n\n282\n00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:47.060\nSo if you're on Exchange.\n\n283\n00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.180\nThis is a slide that basically\njust kind of overviews everything.\n\n284\n00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:54.330\nThe one way versus two way with\nthe POP and the IMAP Exchange.\n\n285\n00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.383\nIt does work a lot like IMAP in a sense\nthat if you going to be deleting it off\n\n286\n00:16:58.383 --> 00:17:01.506\nyour client, it does delete it\noff a server in a sense but\n\n287\n00:17:01.506 --> 00:17:05.040\nthere's always ways that they\ncan go ahead and archive thing.\n\n288\n00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.920\nAs Justin was using an example\nof like you're working for\n\n289\n00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.103\na governmental institution that\nyou have to have everything,\n\n290\n00:17:11.103 --> 00:17:14.160\nI'm sure they have backups\nupon backups upon backups.\n\n291\n00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:19.070\nYou should look for the backup episode\n[LAUGH] from ITProTV on social network.\n\n292\n00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:21.660\nIt's pretty hilarious,\nI was laughing a lot.\n\n293\n00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.615\n&gt;&gt; Well I hope they have\nbackups because if they don't,\n\n294\n00:17:23.615 --> 00:17:25.870\nit could get a little hairy.\n\n295\n00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:31.640\nAnd just to further the Exchange\nconversation, part of that is, that entire\n\n296\n00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.130\ninfrastructure is set up to not only do\nemail, but also a lot of other stuff.\n\n297\n00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:40.040\nAnd part of that is,\nyou had this IMAP like interface,\n\n298\n00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.180\nwe also have the ability to do like remote\nprocedure calls, which allow you to\n\n299\n00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.840\ninstantiate actions that are taken\nthrough this messaging platform.\n\n300\n00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.900\nSo email is not the only type of\nmessaging that can kind of move\n\n301\n00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.310\nthrough an Exchange network,\nfrom my understanding.\n\n302\n00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n303\n00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.385\nIt's just everything.\n\n304\n00:17:57.385 --> 00:18:01.500\n[LAUGH] That you can do in talking\nwith each other in communication.\n\n305\n00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:06.729\nSo yeah, it's all of it, like you said,\nyou threw out some good terminology there.\n\n306\n00:18:06.729 --> 00:18:08.413\nI like your wordage.\n\n307\n00:18:08.413 --> 00:18:12.210\n[LAUGH] And\nthat comes to the end of my slide show.\n\n308\n00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.930\nSo again, just giving you a foundational\nknowledge on some of this stuff, so\n\n309\n00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:20.270\nyou can go to your next dinner party and\nthrow out these terms, and just lean your\n\n310\n00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:24.460\nhead back and laugh, and ha ha ha, and\nthen walk away, and feel really smart.\n\n311\n00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.110\n&gt;&gt; Well, not only can we do that,\nbut we can also have an intelligible\n\n312\n00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:30.210\nconversations about these\nvarious email technologies.\n\n313\n00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.490\nAnd it's important to know the differences\nbetween these two, cuz I've definitely had\n\n314\n00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:37.250\nthose conversations where, hey, I deleted\nthis, but it didn't delete over here.\n\n315\n00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:41.930\nWell, that depends on what type\nof protocol you're using, so.\n\n316\n00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.320\nI'm glad we've started there.\n\n317\n00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.710\nAnd I look forward to more Outlook and\nhopefully, you do as well.\n\n318\n00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.970\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and sign\noff for OfficeProTV, I've been your host,\n\n319\n00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:50.680\nJustin Dennison.\n\n320\n00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.630\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n321\n00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.890\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n322\n00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:58.920\n[SOUND]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.550\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison,\n\n4\n00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.238\nand in today's episode, well, we're coming\nback at you with more Outlook on the web.\n\n5\n00:00:14.238 --> 00:00:18.330\nIn particular, well, we need a little\nmore setup before we dive into Outlook.\n\n6\n00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.490\nAnd here to help us put\non our arm floaties, so\n\n7\n00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.030\nwe don't get all kinds of crazy,\nMs Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.025\nHow're you doing, Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:24.025 --> 00:00:24.530\n&gt;&gt; I love arm floaties.\n\n10\n00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n11\n00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.444\nI wanna make sure I'm\nbuoyant in the water.\n\n12\n00:00:28.444 --> 00:00:30.990\nYeah, but then I got too big,\nand they wouldn't slide.\n\n13\n00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.990\nAnd they would hurt so\nbad when they go on.\n\n14\n00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.660\n&gt;&gt; They would and they kinda just\nhold your head under water, so.\n\n15\n00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.548\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n16\n00:00:36.548 --> 00:00:38.534\n&gt;&gt; But hopefully,\nwe're not gonna do that in Outlook today.\n\n17\n00:00:38.534 --> 00:00:43.368\n&gt;&gt; Well luckily, you don't really need\nmany floaties when setting up Outlook\n\n18\n00:00:43.368 --> 00:00:48.520\naccounts on your web based email client,\nor really, your web based interface.\n\n19\n00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.379\nBecause you have to log into your account\nwith, well, your email address and\n\n20\n00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.440\nyour password, and it sets it all up for\nyou, and you're done.\n\n21\n00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.114\nSo it's almost like, okay, so we have an\nentire episode about setting up your email\n\n22\n00:01:01.114 --> 00:01:03.000\naccount that doesn't require any setup?\n\n23\n00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.646\nHm, then why are we here?\n\n24\n00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:06.297\n[LAUGH] Well, I wanted to go ahead and\n\n25\n00:01:06.297 --> 00:01:08.626\ngive you just a little bit\nmore information on it.\n\n26\n00:01:08.626 --> 00:01:13.985\nAnd also how, well, maybe you wanna use\nOutlook on the web, whether outlook.com or\n\n27\n00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:18.240\nthe Outlook Web App, as they like\nto refer to it as in Office 365.\n\n28\n00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.290\nMaybe you wanna use those accounts\nto manage your other email accounts.\n\n29\n00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.080\nMaybe your Gmail, or your Yahoo,\nor maybe another work account.\n\n30\n00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.700\nSo you can have these platforms,\nif you wanna call them.\n\n31\n00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.580\nEven though it's not perfect, that's not\nreally the right technology, technology?\n\n32\n00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.325\nTerminology, wow,\nfun with words today, [LAUGH] but\n\n33\n00:01:36.325 --> 00:01:39.197\nit's the place where you go ahead and\nmanage your mail.\n\n34\n00:01:39.197 --> 00:01:43.504\nAnd so you can manage multiple email\naccounts, so I would like to go ahead and\n\n35\n00:01:43.504 --> 00:01:44.865\naddress some of those.\n\n36\n00:01:44.865 --> 00:01:47.870\nI have a small PowerPoint\npresentation that actually\n\n37\n00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.450\nfollows the show notes that\nare included with this episode.\n\n38\n00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.460\nBut it's really just more of\na guide to just walk us through\n\n39\n00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.400\nhow to set up an email account.\n\n40\n00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.420\nWell, like I said, you have to log in to\nyour different accounts, whether it's your\n\n41\n00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.680\npaid subscription based model or your free\nversion with that username and password.\n\n42\n00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.950\nBut you go ahead and set up your\nentire account based off of that.\n\n43\n00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.580\nSo your mail is ready to go.\n\n44\n00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.840\nYou log in, and your mail is there.\n\n45\n00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.300\nAnd whether you have been using\nthat particular email through,\n\n46\n00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.120\nsay, your desktop application\nversion of Outlook.\n\n47\n00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.920\nAnd you go ahead and\n\n48\n00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.785\nlog into the web interface and\nall your email is already there.\n\n49\n00:02:25.785 --> 00:02:28.312\nOr you've signed up for\na brand new subscription or\n\n50\n00:02:28.312 --> 00:02:30.325\na brand new account with outlook.com.\n\n51\n00:02:30.325 --> 00:02:33.430\nAnd so you go to the mail and\nthere's, well, nothing there.\n\n52\n00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.590\nCuz you haven't emailed or done anything\nthrough that particular email address.\n\n53\n00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.410\nSo we've looked at the different log\nin URLs that we've seen in some of\n\n54\n00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.550\nour other episodes.\n\n55\n00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.623\nThat go ahead and\n\n56\n00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:50.383\ndirect us to the free versus the paid\nre-subscriptions of our accounts.\n\n57\n00:02:50.383 --> 00:02:54.327\nSo you go ahead and choose which one\nyou would need to log into, well,\n\n58\n00:02:54.327 --> 00:02:55.690\nbased on what you have.\n\n59\n00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.683\nThere's something we should talk about\nhere is supported browsers to be using\n\n60\n00:03:00.683 --> 00:03:01.921\nwith your web interface.\n\n61\n00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:07.413\nReally, pretty much any of your newer\nbrowsers, whether it be Chrome,\n\n62\n00:03:07.413 --> 00:03:11.296\nor Firefox, or Safari,\nthey're all gonna work.\n\n63\n00:03:11.296 --> 00:03:16.210\nNow this is very small type because this\nis just the actual URL that actually\n\n64\n00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.170\nhas all of this information.\n\n65\n00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.380\nAnd it's really the office\nsystem altogether.\n\n66\n00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.260\nIf you're doing like PowerPoint Online or\n\n67\n00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.010\nExcel Online, then it's\nthe requirements that you need to have.\n\n68\n00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.767\nAnd you can see that they,\nof course, they prefer for\n\n69\n00:03:30.767 --> 00:03:32.733\nyou to might use Microsoft products.\n\n70\n00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:34.206\nImagine that there, Justin.\n\n71\n00:03:34.206 --> 00:03:42.900\nSo we have Office 365 is designed\nto work with that latest version.\n\n72\n00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.210\nThat is the one that I am currently\nusing right now since I am on my Windows\n\n73\n00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.320\nmachine, I might as well just stay\nin the family and keep using that.\n\n74\n00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.046\nBut you see that all of the most\ncurrent versions of Safari, Chrome, and\n\n75\n00:03:55.046 --> 00:03:59.542\nFirefox are designed to support\nyour Office Online, and of course,\n\n76\n00:03:59.542 --> 00:04:01.930\nyour Outlook Online.\n\n77\n00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.280\nSo as long as you have a newer\nversion of any of your browsers,\n\n78\n00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.040\nyou're gonna be okay.\n\n79\n00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.686\nWe should talk about-\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne,\n\n80\n00:04:10.686 --> 00:04:14.639\nbefore we move on any further,\nin my development experience,\n\n81\n00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:19.125\nwe always had requests, hey,\ncan you make this work with IE8, IE6?\n\n82\n00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:23.280\n[LAUGH] I'm like no, no, I just said no.\n\n83\n00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.690\nBut I do wanna howl out\na couple of things.\n\n84\n00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.060\nThere are some browsers listed there\nthat people use that aren't listed.\n\n85\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.560\nExcuse me, let me back up.\n\n86\n00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.750\nPeople use them, they're not listed\nlike Opera and things like that.\n\n87\n00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.670\nJust give it a try, even if they're\nnot listed, you may find out Opera has\n\n88\n00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.955\na similar underneath the covers\nruntime that Safari does and may work.\n\n89\n00:04:42.955 --> 00:04:46.270\nNow, I'm not saying that's true,\nbut keep that in mind.\n\n90\n00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.773\nAlso if you are in a corporate\nenvironment, a lot of times,\n\n91\n00:04:48.773 --> 00:04:52.030\nthere's this inertia that you have\nto overcome in order to update.\n\n92\n00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.940\nThe fine print there says\nInternet Explorer 11 if you're in Internet\n\n93\n00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.370\nExplorer, right, they're recommending\nEdge, Internet Explorer 11 will work.\n\n94\n00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.650\nBut if you're at a company or\n\n95\n00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.100\nmaybe a government entity\nwhere Internet Explorer 10.\n\n96\n00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.759\nWell, you should be aware that\nif you use the UI on the web,\n\n97\n00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:12.418\nthe web interface, things may get\na little iffy through those browsers.\n\n98\n00:05:12.418 --> 00:05:17.232\nAnd that's just from experience from mine,\nnot necessarily something that's\n\n99\n00:05:17.232 --> 00:05:20.783\nOutlook specific, but\njust web applications in general.\n\n100\n00:05:20.783 --> 00:05:24.143\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's funny you mention IE6,\nthat's like no, no, bad.\n\n101\n00:05:24.143 --> 00:05:27.671\n[LAUGH] I remember back in the day from\nthere, IE 6 was not so great, sorry,\n\n102\n00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:28.690\nMicrosoft.\n\n103\n00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.846\nBut they've gotten much better.\n\n104\n00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:33.206\nBut it's actually a really good point that\nyou make about these different browsers,\n\n105\n00:05:33.206 --> 00:05:35.225\nand they are listing the ones\nthat are supportive.\n\n106\n00:05:35.225 --> 00:05:36.325\nBut what if you don't have a choice?\n\n107\n00:05:36.325 --> 00:05:38.575\ni know sometimes if you\nare in an organization,\n\n108\n00:05:38.575 --> 00:05:40.500\nyou're not allowed to upgrade.\n\n109\n00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.907\nBecause maybe whatever proprietary portal\nthat they're using only works in IE 8.\n\n110\n00:05:44.907 --> 00:05:50.180\nSo they're never gonna upgrade because\nwell, they can't change their portal.\n\n111\n00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.000\nSo you do have those\nlimitations sometimes.\n\n112\n00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.700\nSo I'm actually gonna jump a slide because\nyou mentioned that there is something, why\n\n113\n00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.865\ndon't I go ahead and get the slide fixed\nin there, something called Outlook Light.\n\n114\n00:06:02.865 --> 00:06:08.514\nAnd one of the things that Outlook Light\nwill do is that you can still go ahead and\n\n115\n00:06:08.514 --> 00:06:11.005\nrun it on an unsupported browser.\n\n116\n00:06:11.005 --> 00:06:13.585\nIt gives you a light version of Outlook.\n\n117\n00:06:13.585 --> 00:06:16.267\nIt is an HTML based application, and\n\n118\n00:06:16.267 --> 00:06:21.380\nit works better with assistive technology,\nsuch as screen readers.\n\n119\n00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.130\nI'm actually reading a little paragraph\noff of one of the links that I have\n\n120\n00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.350\non this slide for you to get more\ninformation about using Outlook Light.\n\n121\n00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.822\nSo it says light versions also work with\nbrowsers that don't support the standard\n\n122\n00:06:32.822 --> 00:06:34.043\nversion of Outlook Web App.\n\n123\n00:06:34.043 --> 00:06:38.264\nAnd then it says to find if your browser\nsupports the full features, go ahead and\n\n124\n00:06:38.264 --> 00:06:42.359\nclick the supported browsers, which is\nthat slide that I had before with that\n\n125\n00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:46.410\nlittle excerpt from the support web\npage through the Microsoft help files.\n\n126\n00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.360\nSo it's funny that you mention that,\nif you did go to one,\n\n127\n00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.450\nyou'd probably just be forced to be\nlogging into or be using Outlook Light.\n\n128\n00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.920\nSo you could go ahead and at least send\nand receive mail, you might not be able to\n\n129\n00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.740\ndo much more than that, but at least,\nyou can, well, get your message across.\n\n130\n00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.210\nSo Outlook Light is something\nout there that you might\n\n131\n00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.580\nrun into from time to time if needed.\n\n132\n00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:17.087\nNow, backing up to my other slide,\nI did wanna mention Outlook.com Premium.\n\n133\n00:07:17.087 --> 00:07:21.734\nNow this is something new because\nOutlook.com is our free version of our\n\n134\n00:07:21.734 --> 00:07:23.960\nOutlook on the web.\n\n135\n00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.680\nWell, if it's free, guess what\nthey're gonna be putting on there?\n\n136\n00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.230\nAds, so you're going to get a little\nside banner over there on the right all\n\n137\n00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.360\nthe time that's going to be\ncontinuously running ads.\n\n138\n00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.736\nI tend to just ignore them, honestly.\n\n139\n00:07:35.736 --> 00:07:39.303\nAnd sometimes, I mean, it's that\nsubliminal advertising where I find I'm at\n\n140\n00:07:39.303 --> 00:07:43.473\nthe store and I'm like, for some reason, I\nreally want this body wash right now, why?\n\n141\n00:07:43.473 --> 00:07:48.342\nBecause I've been seeing it for\ndays upon days in my Outlook.com, so\n\n142\n00:07:48.342 --> 00:07:52.890\nI think it actually works, and\nit kind of makes me think about it.\n\n143\n00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.929\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne,\nI've seen this ad bar a little bit, and\n\n144\n00:07:55.929 --> 00:08:00.240\nit's not a pervasive set of ads,\nlike some things I've seen on other sites.\n\n145\n00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.132\nSo, is there other things that we get with\nthe premium model versus the free model?\n\n146\n00:08:05.132 --> 00:08:09.230\nIs that the only difference, or\ndo we get kind of power ups, so to speak?\n\n147\n00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.460\n&gt;&gt; There is a power up,\nthere is a green mushroom in there.\n\n148\n00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:18.070\nSo it will [LAUGH] allow you to add\nyour own domain names with your account.\n\n149\n00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.695\nSo for example, let's say that you already\nhave a website, you have vonnesmith.com.\n\n150\n00:08:22.695 --> 00:08:27.500\nAnd you wanna say me@vonnesmith.com, and\nthat's the email address that I use.\n\n151\n00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:34.170\nWell, you could go ahead and use\nthe premium account to be able to do that.\n\n152\n00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:37.813\nAnd so I have on this slide some\nlinks there to some websites that\n\n153\n00:08:37.813 --> 00:08:38.997\ngive you some FAQs.\n\n154\n00:08:38.997 --> 00:08:43.353\nAnd so you can see that it does talk\nabout, lets you share your custom domain\n\n155\n00:08:43.353 --> 00:08:47.592\namong five people and removes banner\nads from your Outlook.com inbox.\n\n156\n00:08:47.592 --> 00:08:53.070\nSo those are the two main features\nof the Outlook.com premium account.\n\n157\n00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:58.770\nNow this is a newer feature, or at least,\nnewer at the time of this recording.\n\n158\n00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.110\nSo it hasn't been out for\na very long time.\n\n159\n00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.581\nI did see in these websites\nabout certain areas of\n\n160\n00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:08.970\nthe world that it was even an option.\n\n161\n00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:13.710\nSo there are certain countries,\nthere are certain segments, I would say,\n\n162\n00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.720\nthat it wasn't being offered.\n\n163\n00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.630\nMaybe it's like, I really have\nno idea why they're doing that,\n\n164\n00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:22.480\nmaybe they're just doing a smaller roll\nout first to see if it's gonna catch on.\n\n165\n00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:28.076\nAnd then go ahead and open it up, but\nthat's just me completely speculating.\n\n166\n00:09:28.076 --> 00:09:30.140\n[LAUGH] I don't have any\nproof to back that up.\n\n167\n00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.967\nThat's just me making stuff up.\n\n168\n00:09:31.967 --> 00:09:36.873\n[LAUGH] So we have Outlook.com Premium.\n\n169\n00:09:36.873 --> 00:09:39.330\nNow we did go through the slide\nwith the Outlook Light.\n\n170\n00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.860\nSo let's move on to the next one.\n\n171\n00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.063\nNow managing multiple accounts,\nthis is what I was talking to you\n\n172\n00:09:44.063 --> 00:09:47.689\nin the beginning about hey, I wanna\ngo ahead and manage my Yahoo account.\n\n173\n00:09:47.689 --> 00:09:50.691\nAnd then I have three other emails,\nI think I have, man,\n\n174\n00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:54.020\nI think I've lost count, seven,\neight, nine, ten emails.\n\n175\n00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.570\nAnd all the ones I don't even\nremember from way back in the day.\n\n176\n00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.830\nSo, if you wanted to do that,\nyou could go ahead and set this up.\n\n177\n00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.655\nNow, you can see that it\nhas different links for\n\n178\n00:10:04.655 --> 00:10:07.201\nthe different types of accounts you have.\n\n179\n00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:09.405\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick on this one,\n\n180\n00:10:09.405 --> 00:10:12.520\njust to pull this up to give us\na little bit of a background.\n\n181\n00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.742\nYou can see that it talks about connecting\nit, and if you're using Outlook.com,\n\n182\n00:10:16.742 --> 00:10:19.590\ngo to the other website that\nI have listed on that slide.\n\n183\n00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.910\nBecause it gives you a little bit\nof different set of instructions.\n\n184\n00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:28.350\nIt does talking about if you are going to\nbe using or wanting to have Outlook in\n\n185\n00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:33.960\nmanager, Gmail, you have to do sometimes\na little bit of prepping on the Gmail\n\n186\n00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:39.230\nside first to allow it that email\naddress to be managed by another server,\n\n187\n00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:43.162\nif you wanna say, or at least,\nanother email client.\n\n188\n00:10:43.162 --> 00:10:47.133\nI keep using words that every time it\ncomes out of my mouth, I'm like, again,\n\n189\n00:10:47.133 --> 00:10:51.364\nthat's not totally technically correct,\nbut we kind of blend them all together.\n\n190\n00:10:51.364 --> 00:10:56.855\nSo you can see it gives you some steps,\nsorry, about going into your mail settings\n\n191\n00:10:56.855 --> 00:11:01.810\nand going into your accounts, and\ngoing into your connected accounts.\n\n192\n00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:07.130\nAnd then, talking about those POP\naccounts, remember in our email\n\n193\n00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:12.745\nterminology episode, we did things like,\nwhat is POP, what is SMTP?\n\n194\n00:11:12.745 --> 00:11:15.739\nAnd so it's giving you some of\nthose informations here and\n\n195\n00:11:15.739 --> 00:11:18.745\nhas some troubleshooting of\nhow to connect your account.\n\n196\n00:11:18.745 --> 00:11:24.385\nI love how it says it's usually a typo,\nand yeah, I do that a lot.\n\n197\n00:11:24.385 --> 00:11:29.625\nSo if you ever wanted to configure your\naccounts to manage all of your emails,\n\n198\n00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:32.375\nyou're more than welcome to do so.\n\n199\n00:11:32.375 --> 00:11:33.558\nSo those are just some of the things I\n\n200\n00:11:33.558 --> 00:11:35.381\nwanted to go over about\nsetting up your email account.\n\n201\n00:11:35.381 --> 00:11:39.742\nLike I said, it's already done for\nyou when you sign up for\n\n202\n00:11:39.742 --> 00:11:45.010\na subscription or for your free account,\nand you're ready to go.\n\n203\n00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:48.180\nAnd so what we're gonna do after this\nepisode, we're gonna start jumping\n\n204\n00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.530\ninto the actual interface, getting\nfamiliar with that thing on the right.\n\n205\n00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.877\nWhat's that thing on the right and\nthe left, the other right?\n\n206\n00:11:53.877 --> 00:11:58.784\n[LAUGH] And then being able to go ahead\nand manage our emails, and our context,\n\n207\n00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:03.790\nand our Calendars, and all the fun stuff\nthat Outlook on the web has to offer.\n\n208\n00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.637\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, definitely thanks for\noutlining those.\n\n209\n00:12:05.637 --> 00:12:08.655\nOutlook.com, the free edition and\nthe premium edition,\n\n210\n00:12:08.655 --> 00:12:13.010\nnuanced differences that we have to keep\nin mind when we make those decisions.\n\n211\n00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:16.098\nBut we got more Outlook on the web\ncoming at you, so definitely stay tuned.\n\n212\n00:12:16.098 --> 00:12:18.424\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for OfficeProTV.\n\n213\n00:12:18.424 --> 00:12:20.780\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n214\n00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.590\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n215\n00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:22.340\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n216\n00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.917\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

the Web.\n\n5\n00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.910\nYou thought I was going to\nsay something bad there.\n\n6\n00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.470\nMore specifically we're gonna look at\nthe Interface of Outlook on the web and\n\n7\n00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.406\nhere to help us along is Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:23.406 --> 00:00:24.830\nHow are you doing Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.442\n&gt;&gt; I was almost like wait,\nwhat show are we on?\n\n10\n00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:28.002\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wait, am I in the wrong place?\n\n11\n00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:29.448\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I thought we were\n\n12\n00:00:29.448 --> 00:00:30.514\ngonna talk about Outlook.\n\n13\n00:00:30.514 --> 00:00:33.178\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we are, I almost had you.\n\n14\n00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:37.614\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes so we are going to\nbe exploring the Outlook interface.\n\n15\n00:00:37.614 --> 00:00:39.840\nJust getting us familiar\nwith our environment.\n\n16\n00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.560\nI kinda talked about kitchens\nbefore in some other episodes.\n\n17\n00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.500\nWe need to know where the drawer for\nthe forks are and\n\n18\n00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.960\nwhere the cupboard is with the glasses\nin it so we know where we're going.\n\n19\n00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.990\nAnd how to navigate around our\nkitchen as we go through and\n\n20\n00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.410\nstart baking up some wonderful brownies.\n\n21\n00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.889\nYep, that's where I went, cuz, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know I've had this discussion with\n\n22\n00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:03.723\nfriends when I've been over.\n\n23\n00:01:03.723 --> 00:01:05.610\nI'm like where are your it's\nin the cupboard on the left.\n\n24\n00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.810\nAnd then I go in and on the cupboard\non the left, there's like 30 of them.\n\n25\n00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'm like, which one?\n\n26\n00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.136\nAm I just supposed to\nrifle through your things?\n\n27\n00:01:12.136 --> 00:01:14.761\nBut then you took up the brownies,\nand I got interested again and\n\n28\n00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:17.348\nstopped having the panic attacks\nthat I was having off camera.\n\n29\n00:01:17.348 --> 00:01:19.542\nSo thank you for that, but carry on.\n\n30\n00:01:19.542 --> 00:01:24.352\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Why don't we jump down\ninto my computer, I am using Joey's\n\n31\n00:01:24.352 --> 00:01:29.580\ncomputer today, so we have our\nbeautiful landscape going on here.\n\n32\n00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.377\nHow do I get to our Outlook?\n\n33\n00:01:31.377 --> 00:01:33.560\nWe go to our web browser.\n\n34\n00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.788\nSo, we're gonna jump on in here.\n\n35\n00:01:34.788 --> 00:01:38.060\nNow, I have these marked\non my favorites bar.\n\n36\n00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.830\nI have my Office 365 log in and\nI also have my Outlook.com log in, so\n\n37\n00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.030\nwhy don't I go ahead and jump in here.\n\n38\n00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.220\nJoey's account is already ready to go and\n\n39\n00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.960\nit's remembering the password\nbecause I have it set at that,\n\n40\n00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.670\nbecause it's a very complex password and\nI type it in wrong a lot.\n\n41\n00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.660\nso I'm gonna go ahead and sign in,\nnotice there was that keep me signed in\n\n42\n00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.730\non that dialogue box or that web page I\nshould say, that you could keep that on so\n\n43\n00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.450\nthat way when you log in and\n\n44\n00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.160\nyou click on that favorites button you're\nright in to wherever you're starting from.\n\n45\n00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.950\nNow I say wherever you're starting from\nbecause well this is the start page that\n\n46\n00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.093\nyou've got right now.\n\n47\n00:02:14.093 --> 00:02:19.035\nWell, yes that's because I've kept\nthe default of logging into my Office\n\n48\n00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:23.977\n365 account and it will always start\nin this admin view if you wanna say to\n\n49\n00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:28.840\nwhere you have all of the different\napplications that you can jump into and\n\n50\n00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.860\nlaunch whenever you're ready\nto go ahead and click on them.\n\n51\n00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.970\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne,\nlet me just back up a little bit.\n\n52\n00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.177\nCuz you know me.\n\n53\n00:02:37.177 --> 00:02:38.442\nI tend to be a little paranoid.\n\n54\n00:02:38.442 --> 00:02:41.620\nWell if you don't know me,\nsometimes I get a little antsy.\n\n55\n00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.470\nBecause we can access\nthis through the web,\n\n56\n00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.480\nwe can pretty much access\nthis on any computer.\n\n57\n00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.575\nSo that check box for keep me signed in,\n\n58\n00:02:47.575 --> 00:02:51.762\nyou should be very careful about what\ncomputers you're checking that on.\n\n59\n00:02:51.762 --> 00:02:55.250\nBecause well you don't wanna let\npeople have access to your email.\n\n60\n00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.130\nAnd various other possible\ninterfaces as we've seen here.\n\n61\n00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.666\n&gt;&gt; That's a really good point, because I\nwas actually just at my friend's house up\n\n62\n00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:04.012\nin New York, and\nI went hey I need to check my email.\n\n63\n00:03:04.012 --> 00:03:08.875\nAnd I go, I was going to my Gmail,\nand I have all of his stuff.\n\n64\n00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:11.245\nI'm in his Google Drive,\nbut I'm on his computer.\n\n65\n00:03:11.245 --> 00:03:13.355\nSo of course, we're friends.\n\n66\n00:03:13.355 --> 00:03:15.145\nI just signed him off and\nI signed myself in.\n\n67\n00:03:15.145 --> 00:03:19.815\nBut if you're on shared network computers,\nespecially if you're on work computers,\n\n68\n00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:22.731\nyou might not wanna go ahead and\nkeep that check box in.\n\n69\n00:03:22.731 --> 00:03:26.327\nAnd so I know you do a lot\nof development work, too.\n\n70\n00:03:26.327 --> 00:03:30.413\nAnd so when you start doing dev work, you\nstart to think about security a lot, too.\n\n71\n00:03:30.413 --> 00:03:32.300\nSo, [LAUGH] Good point, very good point.\n\n72\n00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:39.679\nSo I'm here in my home page or my start\npage of my Office 365 subscription,\n\n73\n00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:44.230\nI can check which one I\nwant to be able to go into.\n\n74\n00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.741\nNow notice over here I have mail,\ncalendar, people, and\n\n75\n00:03:48.741 --> 00:03:51.052\na whole bunch of other stuff.\n\n76\n00:03:51.052 --> 00:03:54.629\nNow you might not have all of these\nbuttons because of course you have\n\n77\n00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.639\ndifferent levels of subscriptions,\n\n78\n00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.741\nand different applications that you can\nhave access to or not have access to.\n\n79\n00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:04.382\nBut one thing I want to point out right\noff the bat is that it doesn't say\n\n80\n00:04:04.382 --> 00:04:04.951\nOutlook.\n\n81\n00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:09.738\nWe're not looking for Outlook like\nyou look for say Word or Excel or\n\n82\n00:04:09.738 --> 00:04:13.580\nPowerPoint, those particular applications.\n\n83\n00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.600\nSo Outlook as its own\nentity doesn't live here.\n\n84\n00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.130\nThey've broken it up into those\ndifferent parts that Outlook manages,\n\n85\n00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.110\nsuch as your mail, your calendar.\n\n86\n00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.812\nWhat they normally say as contacts\nin the desktop version of Outlook,\n\n87\n00:04:31.812 --> 00:04:33.571\nthey call it People here.\n\n88\n00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:35.570\nSo who are the people that you know?\n\n89\n00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.040\nSo People, contacts, mean the same thing.\n\n90\n00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.010\nYou also have your tasks.\n\n91\n00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.476\nThese are normally all together\nin that Outlook application that\n\n92\n00:04:44.476 --> 00:04:47.951\nyou have look himself, so\nyou have them kinda spread out in here.\n\n93\n00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:51.125\nAnd that can be sometimes\na little confusing off the bat,\n\n94\n00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:54.047\nbecause you're looking for\nthat particular word.\n\n95\n00:04:54.047 --> 00:04:58.990\nNow when I start,\nsay you're always going to want to go\n\n96\n00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.900\ninto your mail from your start.\n\n97\n00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.630\nLike I log in,\nI wanna go right to my email.\n\n98\n00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.584\nYou could go ahead and\nchange that in the settings.\n\n99\n00:05:06.584 --> 00:05:09.221\nNow all of your Office 365 applications,\nand\n\n100\n00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:12.142\nonce we get into the mail in\nhere it'll look the same.\n\n101\n00:05:12.142 --> 00:05:17.096\nYou're gonna have this top I call\nit the header, navigation bar.\n\n102\n00:05:17.096 --> 00:05:22.246\nI actually went and looked through\na lot of different web sites.\n\n103\n00:05:22.246 --> 00:05:26.250\nI couldn't find the technical name\nthat Microsoft is saying what this is.\n\n104\n00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.740\nSo I've determined it as\nthe top header navigation.\n\n105\n00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.608\nAcross the top you can see that you have\nthe button that allows you to go back to\n\n106\n00:05:34.608 --> 00:05:37.694\nthis tile view to the different\napplications that are within\n\n107\n00:05:37.694 --> 00:05:42.070\nthe subscription that you have, and it's\ntelling you that you are in Office 365.\n\n108\n00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.998\nWe come over here to the right hand side,\nwe have a little bell, those are for\n\n109\n00:05:46.998 --> 00:05:48.470\nyour notifications.\n\n110\n00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.210\nAnd then you have the little wheel guy\nyes, that's the technical name as well.\n\n111\n00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.150\nThe little wheelie guy,\nthat is your Settings button.\n\n112\n00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.530\nSo you can click on this Settings button,\nand right here you have Start page.\n\n113\n00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.820\nThe start page of what's gonna start\nwhen you login to your account.\n\n114\n00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.680\nAnd this is where you could set this\nto where I could put it to go right\n\n115\n00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.670\ndirectly to my mail or to my calendar or\nto the thing that I use the most.\n\n116\n00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.924\nIf this tiled view of all of your\napplication then keep it right where\n\n117\n00:06:17.924 --> 00:06:20.220\nit's at you don't have\nto change the default.\n\n118\n00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.233\nBut I do know that since a lot of\npeople only use this for mail or\n\n119\n00:06:24.233 --> 00:06:28.565\nprimarily that's something that\nI've had people ask me about so\n\n120\n00:06:28.565 --> 00:06:31.024\nI wanted to throw that in right away.\n\n121\n00:06:31.024 --> 00:06:36.560\nSo if I wanted to jump in to my email,\njust click on mail.\n\n122\n00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.118\nI click on mail, opens up and\nnotice it does open up in a new tab,\n\n123\n00:06:41.118 --> 00:06:43.628\nand then it brings up my Outlook.\n\n124\n00:06:43.628 --> 00:06:49.282\nAnd so now I'm in Office 365 Outlook,\nand here is my inbox.\n\n125\n00:06:49.282 --> 00:06:52.468\nNow once you're in the mail application,\n\n126\n00:06:52.468 --> 00:06:58.230\nover here on the left-hand side down\nat the bottom, in the navigation pane.\n\n127\n00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.337\nThis is where if you're familiar\nwith the desktop version of Outlook,\n\n128\n00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:04.300\nyou're like okay now it's starting\nto look somewhat familiar.\n\n129\n00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.302\nCuz they call this area\nthe navigation pane to where you can\n\n130\n00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:10.071\njump into the different\nareas that Outlook manages.\n\n131\n00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:14.740\nYour calendar, your contacts, or people.\n\n132\n00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.020\nI'll probably keep saying\ncontacts by the way, and\n\n133\n00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.690\nany time you hear me say\ncontacts it really is people.\n\n134\n00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:20.510\nAnd then your tasks.\n\n135\n00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.358\nSo if I jump down here,\nit's going to open up\n\n136\n00:07:24.358 --> 00:07:29.051\nwithin the same browser tab\nto get into the calendar.\n\n137\n00:07:29.051 --> 00:07:33.310\nOr I can come over to the People,\nand it shows me my People.\n\n138\n00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.861\nBut if I come back over to the tab where\nmy home navigation, my admin page is,\n\n139\n00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:45.890\nI could have accessed my People,\nsaid it right, from here.\n\n140\n00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.960\nAnd notice then it jumps\nover into a new tab.\n\n141\n00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.229\nCome back over to the tab\nthat has my main page.\n\n142\n00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:56.522\nI could click on calendar notice that\nthis time every time its opening\n\n143\n00:07:56.522 --> 00:07:57.272\nup in a new tab.\n\n144\n00:07:57.272 --> 00:08:04.478\nSo if you didn't want to have everything\nstaying within the same, Browser tab.\n\n145\n00:08:04.478 --> 00:08:09.389\nYou could open each one up individually\nand go back from your calendar to your\n\n146\n00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:13.547\npeople, to your, well now I have\npeople open twice on two tabs.\n\n147\n00:08:13.547 --> 00:08:17.890\nSo maybe if you come down over here and\nclick on my mail.\n\n148\n00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.476\nCould be slightly confusing if\nyou're not really paying attention.\n\n149\n00:08:21.476 --> 00:08:23.352\nAnd you're getting kinda click happy.\n\n150\n00:08:23.352 --> 00:08:24.787\nYou know okay, click, click,\nclick, click, click and\n\n151\n00:08:24.787 --> 00:08:25.735\nnow you got all these different tabs.\n\n152\n00:08:25.735 --> 00:08:30.649\nAnd you have five tabs open with\nthe same area of like people.\n\n153\n00:08:30.649 --> 00:08:35.822\nWatch the tabs, watch for where\nyou're at and know that clicking from\n\n154\n00:08:35.822 --> 00:08:42.250\nyour admin page opens up separately versus\nnavigation, same window to each its own.\n\n155\n00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:46.580\nIt's really a personal preference\non each one you want to be able to\n\n156\n00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.890\nwork in the interface of how\nyou're working through here.\n\n157\n00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:55.320\nSo being familiar with a tabbed\nenvironment within your browser or\n\n158\n00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.610\nleast multiple windows.\n\n159\n00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:01.001\nBecause you can set these different\nparameters within your browser settings of\n\n160\n00:09:01.001 --> 00:09:04.882\nhow you want all links to open up in\na new window, or all links a new tab.\n\n161\n00:09:04.882 --> 00:09:09.685\nSo those browser settings might\noverride some of this settings that I´m\n\n162\n00:09:09.685 --> 00:09:14.190\nmoving through that,\nwhat I´m talking about here using edge.\n\n163\n00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:19.370\nSo just be aware that and\nknow that hey, I can close one tab\n\n164\n00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:25.200\nseparately than closing the entire\nweb browser, the whole program down.\n\n165\n00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.950\nSo be very aware of that.\n\n166\n00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:31.047\nAnd if you haven't been familiar with it,\nyou'll start to get pretty familiar with\n\n167\n00:09:31.047 --> 00:09:33.308\nit pretty quickly with\nusing this interface.\n\n168\n00:09:33.308 --> 00:09:36.896\nSo just to kinda keep it\na little easier for me,\n\n169\n00:09:36.896 --> 00:09:40.630\nI'm gonna stay within one browser window.\n\n170\n00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:47.150\nAnd going back and forth from our\ndifferent areas in this one same window.\n\n171\n00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:52.330\nNow in this mail application across the\ntop, in our top navigation or top header\n\n172\n00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:57.400\nnavigation we still have the same buttons\nthat we had seen in our admin page.\n\n173\n00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.771\nWe had the notifications.\n\n174\n00:09:58.771 --> 00:10:00.297\nWe have the little wheel guy.\n\n175\n00:10:00.297 --> 00:10:05.550\nNow the settings here, these\nare the settings for your mail as opposed\n\n176\n00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:10.370\nto back over in our admin,\nthe settings are for the admin page.\n\n177\n00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.570\nSo it is all about where are you at,\n\n178\n00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:18.510\nat the time when you clicked that top\nwheel button they will be different.\n\n179\n00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.986\nAgain, just being very aware of what\ntab you are in and where I'm going.\n\n180\n00:10:21.986 --> 00:10:23.440\nAnd where am I?\n\n181\n00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.963\nIt's a question I am always asking,\nJustin.\n\n182\n00:10:24.963 --> 00:10:29.110\n&gt;&gt; So I think the navigation can be\na little tricky something that I have\n\n183\n00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.670\ntrouble with because I'm a tab fanatic.\n\n184\n00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:32.650\nI don't know about you, but\n\n185\n00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:36.860\nI like having a bunch of tabs open just\nto make my life more difficult sometimes.\n\n186\n00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:41.180\nBut there is something that I noticed on\nthe original Office 365 home page where\n\n187\n00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.860\nwe can access mail and things.\n\n188\n00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:47.280\nIf we look there it's actually\nhard to see Office 365.\n\n189\n00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.052\nIs there any way to change that to where\nnot only maybe the color's different?\n\n190\n00:10:52.052 --> 00:10:57.577\nBut I'm not getting a lot of\nfeedback on that top header nav bar.\n\n191\n00:10:57.577 --> 00:11:03.640\nI know I'm in Outlook on the subsequent\npages, but can it be Outlook people?\n\n192\n00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.720\nOr can I just change the color, or what?\n\n193\n00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.910\n&gt;&gt; That what you're looking\nat there is themes.\n\n194\n00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.944\nAnd that's where you can\npersonalize what it looks like.\n\n195\n00:11:09.944 --> 00:11:13.440\nI chose these blocks and I actually\nnoticed that too when I using it.\n\n196\n00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.961\nI'm like you can't really use Office 365.\n\n197\n00:11:15.961 --> 00:11:17.624\nAnd so I was coming back around.\n\n198\n00:11:17.624 --> 00:11:22.459\nSo I'm so glad you pointed it out right\nnow because it is kind of hard to see\n\n199\n00:11:22.459 --> 00:11:26.230\nwhere I'm at,\nin this admin page in the settings.\n\n200\n00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.450\nI have an option for\nthemes and I could go crazy.\n\n201\n00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.204\nHey, let's throw some pink in there.\n\n202\n00:11:31.204 --> 00:11:33.237\nSee, I would choose something like this.\n\n203\n00:11:33.237 --> 00:11:35.546\n[LAUGH] Justin's over there going,\nthat's a little too much.\n\n204\n00:11:35.546 --> 00:11:39.275\n&gt;&gt; That´s a little overwhelming on that.\n\n205\n00:11:39.275 --> 00:11:42.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean if I needed to go out at night\n\n206\n00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:44.520\nand be reflective I\nwould just have that up.\n\n207\n00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.175\nBut other than that,\nI don´t know if I could use that.\n\n208\n00:11:46.175 --> 00:11:47.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hyper colors,\ndo you remember that?\n\n209\n00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:48.680\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yep.\n\n210\n00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.862\n&gt;&gt; I had those shirts.\n\n211\n00:11:49.862 --> 00:11:54.080\n[LAUGH] Yes,\nI have this actually on my work account.\n\n212\n00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.260\nThis is the web interface,\n\n213\n00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.140\nI have the kitties cause as\nyou all know me I like cats.\n\n214\n00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:02.130\nSo you can go ahead and change your\ntheme to whatever you feel like.\n\n215\n00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:06.957\nAnd they do have some solid colors there\nto make it a little less crazy there.\n\n216\n00:12:06.957 --> 00:12:09.010\nThey have some nice gradients in there.\n\n217\n00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:14.000\nYou can pick your theme to make it\nmore towards what you want to see\n\n218\n00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.400\nin your interface.\n\n219\n00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.881\nSo very good point there.\n\n220\n00:12:16.881 --> 00:12:18.039\nNow across the top and\n\n221\n00:12:18.039 --> 00:12:21.520\nnotice that I do have a different\ntheme here in my mail right now.\n\n222\n00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.390\nAnd also I haven't refreshed my browser so\nit hasn't really taken on.\n\n223\n00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.100\nOne thing to notice though.\n\n224\n00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.770\nIf I click on say the calendar down in\nthe navigation, it still says Outlook.\n\n225\n00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:35.540\nIf I click on the people\nit still says Outlook.\n\n226\n00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.940\nThis is, I feel one of the default\nsettings because we're in\n\n227\n00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.750\nOffice 365 cuz it really is all Outlook.\n\n228\n00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.420\nLet me jump over here,\nI'm gonna open up a brand new tab and\n\n229\n00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:51.750\nI'm gonna log into the outlook.com\naccount that I have.\n\n230\n00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:57.984\nAnd it is vonne@officeprodemo,\nI have to do this every time.\n\n231\n00:12:57.984 --> 00:13:02.730\n[LAUGH] It's also a little new to me, so\noutlook.com, let's see if I can get the-\n\n232\n00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:03.443\n&gt;&gt; PowerLook.\n\n233\n00:13:03.443 --> 00:13:04.620\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, t there.\n\n234\n00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.034\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, see Justin,\nI was seeing if you were paying attention.\n\n235\n00:13:08.034 --> 00:13:08.955\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Good job.\n\n236\n00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:11.781\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I was mesmerized with the amount of\n\n237\n00:13:11.781 --> 00:13:14.720\nvarious characters that you\nkinda strung together there.\n\n238\n00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.570\nSo I understand your play.\n\n239\n00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:19.570\n&gt;&gt; I probably should go ahead and\nsave the password, I know.\n\n240\n00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:23.820\nBut I'm gonna do our security,\nyou know best practices and not save it.\n\n241\n00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:28.080\nAnd so look at this,\nthis is my free version of Outlook.com.\n\n242\n00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.110\nI mean, Outlook Mail and it says nail.\n\n243\n00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.930\nSame navigation's, so\na lot of the interface that's,\n\n244\n00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:39.740\nall this whole episode does apply the both\noutlook.com, and our Outlook web app.\n\n245\n00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.671\nVery slight difference, maybe a little\nbit of verbage here and there.\n\n246\n00:13:42.671 --> 00:13:44.883\nBut overall it's much the same.\n\n247\n00:13:44.883 --> 00:13:47.787\nBut if I do click on the calendar\nit does say calendar and\n\n248\n00:13:47.787 --> 00:13:50.260\nif I click on people it does say people.\n\n249\n00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:55.340\nI do like that, I personally like to\nknow where I'm at, but I've just noticed\n\n250\n00:13:55.340 --> 00:14:00.580\nthat the default settings it seems that in\nOffice 365 versus free and that's where.\n\n251\n00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:04.460\n&gt;&gt; Now Von you keep saying default\nsettings in the Office 365 version versus\n\n252\n00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.193\nthe free one.\n\n253\n00:14:05.193 --> 00:14:09.101\nIs there any way that I can tweak instead\nof it saying Office 365 Outlook I can get\n\n254\n00:14:09.101 --> 00:14:14.030\nsomething like in the free version where\nit'll say Outlook Mail or Outlook People?\n\n255\n00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:17.380\n&gt;&gt; You know I'm gonna be\ncompletely honest, I don't know.\n\n256\n00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.020\nI've tried, I've actually looked.\n\n257\n00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:23.420\nI have looked this up and\nI have not found anything.\n\n258\n00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:27.096\nBut just like any the wonderful\nworld of the Internet, I'm sure\n\n259\n00:14:27.096 --> 00:14:32.690\nsomebody's written something in some\nscripting language that has changed this.\n\n260\n00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.929\nAgain, I'm making it up right now but\nI I've looked at this.\n\n261\n00:14:35.929 --> 00:14:38.466\nI have not found anything as of yet.\n\n262\n00:14:38.466 --> 00:14:42.691\nSo maybe I'll throw a challenge out there\nand see if anybody else can find it and\n\n263\n00:14:42.691 --> 00:14:44.686\ngo ahead and email me and let me know.\n\n264\n00:14:44.686 --> 00:14:47.478\n[LAUGH] I haven't seen it though.\n\n265\n00:14:47.478 --> 00:14:52.232\n&gt;&gt; That is unfortunate because you\nwould think that should be applicable.\n\n266\n00:14:52.232 --> 00:14:55.505\nBut sometimes those features\ndon't translate easily or\n\n267\n00:14:55.505 --> 00:14:58.517\nthey're just intentionally not translated,\nso.\n\n268\n00:14:58.517 --> 00:14:59.907\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You and\n\n269\n00:14:59.907 --> 00:15:04.044\nI think a lot alike because I did look for\nit, too.\n\n270\n00:15:04.044 --> 00:15:06.825\nSo that's why I kept\nsaying default settings,\n\n271\n00:15:06.825 --> 00:15:11.060\ndefault settings because that's\nthe default setting, awesome.\n\n272\n00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:16.150\nSo back over into here, we do have\na cross of our top header navigation.\n\n273\n00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.770\nWe also have our help.\n\n274\n00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.200\nAlways good to know where the help is.\n\n275\n00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.111\nOur help files are very\nhelpful in Microsoft.\n\n276\n00:15:22.111 --> 00:15:26.167\nNow you also have your account\ninformation to where you can go into\n\n277\n00:15:26.167 --> 00:15:30.313\nsigning out to your account,\nviewing your account information.\n\n278\n00:15:30.313 --> 00:15:33.645\nAnd since this is\nan Office Pro Plus account and\n\n279\n00:15:33.645 --> 00:15:39.035\nI think we might even be in the e level\ncuz we had to upgrade some things.\n\n280\n00:15:39.035 --> 00:15:42.515\nIf I go into my account settings it\nmight look a lot different than yours.\n\n281\n00:15:42.515 --> 00:15:44.795\nSo just know that it might\ntake you have to delve or\n\n282\n00:15:44.795 --> 00:15:50.249\nsome other type of area that it manages\nyour directory information we'll call it.\n\n283\n00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.523\nYou do have a little x over here on\nthe top right corner to where if you start\n\n284\n00:15:55.523 --> 00:15:57.792\nclicking on these buttons across the top.\n\n285\n00:15:57.792 --> 00:16:01.933\nThey're bringing up this right\nhand side pane of the settings and\n\n286\n00:16:01.933 --> 00:16:03.295\nthe notifications.\n\n287\n00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:04.911\nAnd your account information.\n\n288\n00:16:04.911 --> 00:16:10.086\nAnd a lot of times there's that X, but\nthe other thing is if you don't see the X,\n\n289\n00:16:10.086 --> 00:16:14.920\nif you click the button again,\nit kinda swooshes it again, swoosh.\n\n290\n00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.909\n&gt;&gt; That is a really good word,\nVonne I'm gonna start using that.\n\n291\n00:16:16.909 --> 00:16:18.838\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Click that button and\n\n292\n00:16:18.838 --> 00:16:19.865\nit'll swish it away.\n\n293\n00:16:19.865 --> 00:16:21.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna file that\n\n294\n00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.020\naway for later use.\n\n295\n00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.750\n&gt;&gt; It's funny you said swish and\nI said swoosh.\n\n296\n00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:29.552\n&gt;&gt; Who knows, with my accent,\nwho knows what I said so.\n\n297\n00:16:29.552 --> 00:16:30.315\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n298\n00:16:30.315 --> 00:16:32.030\n&gt;&gt; I would say one of the two, Vonne.\n\n299\n00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:35.005\n&gt;&gt; Okay,and the letters are right\nnext to each other on the keyboard.\n\n300\n00:16:35.005 --> 00:16:36.795\nSo you're typing it in your brain, right?\n\n301\n00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:37.837\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n302\n00:16:37.837 --> 00:16:43.495\n[LAUGH] So coming back over here to the\nleft-hand side, this is our folder pane.\n\n303\n00:16:43.495 --> 00:16:46.565\nDepending on which area\nof Outlook we're in,\n\n304\n00:16:46.565 --> 00:16:51.410\nwhether we're in our People or\nour Calendar or\n\n305\n00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:56.128\nour Mail, you can see that that\nleft-hand folder pane is gonna change.\n\n306\n00:16:56.128 --> 00:17:01.850\nBecause that's gonna show you the basic\nnavigation of that particular area and\n\n307\n00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:03.600\nyour different folders.\n\n308\n00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.540\nAnd whether you're looking at calendars or\nmail, or in this instance, I'm back\n\n309\n00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:12.490\nin my mail in my inbox versus my deleted\nitems versus my conversation history.\n\n310\n00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:13.700\nAnd things like that.\n\n311\n00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.945\nSince we're talking about the overall\ninterface, we're not gonna get\n\n312\n00:17:17.945 --> 00:17:22.300\ntoo deep into this mail interface,\ncuz we have our own episode on that.\n\n313\n00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:28.060\nBack up at the top on this left-hand side,\nwe have Search, Mail, and People.\n\n314\n00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.950\nSearching is always a very\ngood thing to do because hey,\n\n315\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.000\nI know we talked about lunch,\nbut was that an email?\n\n316\n00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.060\nWas that a calendar item?\n\n317\n00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.370\nI don't remember which one.\n\n318\n00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:40.920\nDo take notice before I go ahead and\n\n319\n00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:45.410\nstart typing, if I'm in the Calendar\nsection, I'm searching my calendar.\n\n320\n00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.940\nIf I'm in People, I'm searching people.\n\n321\n00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:53.780\nSo the search does get, we'll call it\nfiltered, to whatever area you are in.\n\n322\n00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:57.695\nBut if you trying to do a search\nacross all of the different areas,\n\n323\n00:17:57.695 --> 00:18:02.530\nif you go to the Mail section and\nyou type in, let's say lunch.\n\n324\n00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.040\nAnd I hit Enter, now notice it says,\nsearch People, searching Groups.\n\n325\n00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.350\nIf I hit Enter,\nit brings my folder pane, or\n\n326\n00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:15.230\nthat left-hand side,\nwe'll just call it, into my search.\n\n327\n00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:19.090\nAnd so it's giving me different\nthings here of all folders versus no,\n\n328\n00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:22.260\njust stick with the Inbox, or\njust stick with the Sent Items.\n\n329\n00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:27.050\nAnd notice I have over here,\nI have an email, I also have a calendar,\n\n330\n00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:28.350\nI have some other things.\n\n331\n00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:32.860\nSo you might need to try to stay in that\none area to try and get an overall search,\n\n332\n00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:38.142\nrather than getting more specific in the\ndifferent areas that you need to be in.\n\n333\n00:18:38.142 --> 00:18:42.160\nNotice that you do have some\nother types of filterings and\n\n334\n00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.060\nsearch parameters when you\nstart going into your search.\n\n335\n00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.965\nBut now it's like okay,\nI'm done with my search.\n\n336\n00:18:46.965 --> 00:18:51.893\nIt's nice that I put right there at\nthe top, Exit Search, you come back into\n\n337\n00:18:51.893 --> 00:18:56.360\nhere and you're back into where ever\nyou had left off on in your mail.\n\n338\n00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.320\nNext to the search area, across the top,\n\n339\n00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:06.420\nthis main section up here,\nI'm gonna call that the top menu bar.\n\n340\n00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:07.681\nThat's what I'm calling it.\n\n341\n00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:11.711\n[LAUGH] Because it is going to give you\ndifferent options that come up depending\n\n342\n00:19:11.711 --> 00:19:13.190\non what you are on.\n\n343\n00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:17.760\nRight now it just says New,\ncuz I'm in the inbox area of my mail.\n\n344\n00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.700\nSo if I have a drop down, normally I'm\ngonna probably start a new message.\n\n345\n00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.510\nBut I do have a different option of\ndoing a calendar event or a group.\n\n346\n00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:31.360\nBut if I select a specific email, notice\nhow my menu bar, my top navigation area,\n\n347\n00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.680\nit changes to say, well now you're\nactually in a specific message.\n\n348\n00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.440\nWhat do you wanna do with that message?\n\n349\n00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.570\nDo you want to move it?\n\n350\n00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:39.490\nDo you wanna categorize it?\n\n351\n00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.040\nDo you wanna delete it?\n\n352\n00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:45.420\nIf I was back over in my Calendar,\nnotice that it's says Adding Calendars.\n\n353\n00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.920\nInteresting calendars, and\nthat's were you could actually pull up\n\n354\n00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:53.410\ndifferent calendars that are tied to your\nfavorite sports team or different things.\n\n355\n00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:57.020\nIt's kind of a cute little\nfeature that it allows you to do.\n\n356\n00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:01.828\nAnd of course I'm following my\nfavorite hockey team, go Lightning.\n\n357\n00:20:01.828 --> 00:20:02.754\nSo [LAUGH] you could go ahead and\ndo things like that.\n\n358\n00:20:02.754 --> 00:20:07.182\nBack into that search again,\nnotice, or sorry, the settings,\n\n359\n00:20:07.182 --> 00:20:12.075\nsince I'm here in Calendar, it is\ngiving me calendar appearance settings.\n\n360\n00:20:12.075 --> 00:20:16.888\nVersus back in the Mail, the settings\nare gonna talk about things like automatic\n\n361\n00:20:16.888 --> 00:20:19.260\nreplies and display settings.\n\n362\n00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:25.646\nSo it does take you to specific areas of\nthose settings that are in that area.\n\n363\n00:20:25.646 --> 00:20:28.929\nAnd actually it's behind my head,\nso if you go ahead, and\n\n364\n00:20:28.929 --> 00:20:30.950\nlet me show you behind me.\n\n365\n00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:35.670\nWe've got, down here, your app settings,\nat the very bottom, I did have to scroll.\n\n366\n00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.450\nMaybe I'm in the Mail section, but\n\n367\n00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.260\nI wanted to change some\nof my calendar settings.\n\n368\n00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:45.186\nIt goes right over here, it doesn't\nmatter which one you click on it.\n\n369\n00:20:45.186 --> 00:20:49.346\nCuz when you click on it,\nnotice over on the left-hand side,\n\n370\n00:20:49.346 --> 00:20:52.070\nyou're getting to all of the settings.\n\n371\n00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.178\nIt's kind of like if your\non the desktop version,\n\n372\n00:20:54.178 --> 00:20:58.350\nyou're going to that File tab or the\nbackstage view, and going to Options and\n\n373\n00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.710\nthen getting that dialog box that\nhas all the different pieces.\n\n374\n00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:08.170\nThis is where you find it, and so it's\nthere, you have to kind of dig for it.\n\n375\n00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.340\nNow since I've been to it so\nmany times, it's just second nature.\n\n376\n00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:16.430\nBut it took me a while to find that\nat first, where is my out of office?\n\n377\n00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:22.240\nWhere is where I can change how\nwhat's been read in my message box?\n\n378\n00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.539\nAll of it's in here in your Settings.\n\n379\n00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.850\nIf you come into the General,\nyou have your things like your account.\n\n380\n00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.080\nYou could go ahead and\nmanage the lite version.\n\n381\n00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:35.840\nWe did mention Outlook Lite in our talking\nabout setting up our email account.\n\n382\n00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.462\nSo that's where you could go ahead and\nchange that.\n\n383\n00:21:38.462 --> 00:21:42.290\nYou could change your theme, but that's\nalways over on the right-hand side too.\n\n384\n00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:46.840\nAnd then you go into your different\nareas of My Mail Settings.\n\n385\n00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.950\nHow do I change my junk mail reporting?\n\n386\n00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.030\nHow do I do my mark as read?\n\n387\n00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:55.769\nMy retention policy, now this is something\nthat you might not have access to,\n\n388\n00:21:55.769 --> 00:21:59.521\ndepending on your level of subscription,\nso don't worry if it's not there.\n\n389\n00:21:59.521 --> 00:22:03.040\nConnected accounts, we talked about\nthat in the set up email accounts.\n\n390\n00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.480\nMaybe you wanna manage your Gmail or\n\n391\n00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.370\nother types of email accounts here,\nyou could add them.\n\n392\n00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:13.590\nSo you could see here, any type of area\nthat I wanna control the settings,\n\n393\n00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:17.970\nI just go down to that bottom\nright-hand side, get into the area.\n\n394\n00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:22.650\nMy left-hand side navigation pane\nbrings up all the information that\n\n395\n00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:27.040\nI need to go ahead and access, and\nthat's where you control everything.\n\n396\n00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:32.954\nOne small note, everything, like I said,\nis pretty much the same in Outlook.com.\n\n397\n00:22:32.954 --> 00:22:35.013\nThe biggest difference\nis that your settings,\n\n398\n00:22:35.013 --> 00:22:36.770\nit just shows as a little drop down menu.\n\n399\n00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:40.990\nIt doesn't show over as a navigation\npane like the other ones.\n\n400\n00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:44.230\nBut if I go into Options,\n\n401\n00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.388\nit gives me all the same things over\nthere on that left-hand side as well.\n\n402\n00:22:47.388 --> 00:22:51.540\nSo you could go into the General,\nin the Mail, in the Calendar, and\n\n403\n00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.920\ngo through things like that.\n\n404\n00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.385\nSo just know that where you're\nclicking on makes a big difference.\n\n405\n00:22:57.385 --> 00:23:01.340\nBeing very aware of your tabs,\nwhat panes are coming up.\n\n406\n00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.330\nDo I need to go to the left,\ndo I need to go to the right?\n\n407\n00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:07.430\nIt takes a while to find the measuring\ncups and find the flour and\n\n408\n00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.790\nfind your bowl and make those brownies.\n\n409\n00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:14.485\nBut you'll be able to start baking\nto your heart's content very soon.\n\n410\n00:23:14.485 --> 00:23:17.375\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne, just to continue on\nwith that analogy, just remember,\n\n411\n00:23:17.375 --> 00:23:20.015\nif you're in the bedroom, you're probably\nnot gonna find your baking goods like you\n\n412\n00:23:20.015 --> 00:23:21.595\nanticipated, so always-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n413\n00:23:21.595 --> 00:23:23.235\n&gt;&gt; Always be aware of where you are within\n\n414\n00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:23.885\nthe application.\n\n415\n00:23:23.885 --> 00:23:28.075\nNow I didn't know that the Outlook\npremium model had as many features, and\n\n416\n00:23:28.075 --> 00:23:30.375\nit's pretty full-fledged\nto be a web application.\n\n417\n00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:31.975\nSo if you've always thought,\n\n418\n00:23:31.975 --> 00:23:35.150\nit's kind of a watered down version of\nthe install, it's not what I'm seeing.\n\n419\n00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:38.170\nAnd I know we have a lot more to do.\n\n420\n00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:41.540\nSo definitely join us back as\nwe continue Outlook on the Web..\n\n421\n00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.900\nBut, for now, signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n422\n00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:45.560\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n423\n00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.969\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n424\n00:23:47.969 -->

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.710\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\n\n4\n00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.150\nin today's episode well we're\nback at you with more Outlook.\n\n5\n00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.210\nYou asked for it, we got more of it and\n\n6\n00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.800\nin particular well we're gonna\nlook at the mail interfacing.\n\n7\n00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.180\nAnd to help us do that\nis Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.220\nHow you doing today Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.860\n&gt;&gt; I'm good.\n\n10\n00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.150\nYes, we are going to explore the interface\nspecifically in the mail section\n\n11\n00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.850\nof our Outlook on the web or\nour Outlook Web application.\n\n12\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.938\nSo let's jump right in and get started.\n\n13\n00:00:33.938 --> 00:00:37.860\nI've got Joey's email\npulled up right here and\n\n14\n00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.280\nwe're in the mail section and so\nlet's talk about these different areas.\n\n15\n00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.770\nWe did talk about the Outlook interface\n\n16\n00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.370\naltogether of where the calendar\nis in these different places.\n\n17\n00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:55.720\nNow let's talk about these folders\nwithin our email, I almost said system.\n\n18\n00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.670\nJust throwing out words here.\n\n19\n00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.950\nThey're technically called folders.\n\n20\n00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.770\nWhat type of folders do we have\nthat are working with our mail?\n\n21\n00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.640\nWe have our inbox inmail that's\ncoming into us that we are receiving.\n\n22\n00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.320\nThere's a couple of different icons and\n\n23\n00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.020\nthings that as we move\naround through here,\n\n24\n00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.940\nwhether you hover over them, there's some\nthings with some numbers to the right.\n\n25\n00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.590\nThere's these little\ncarrot looking things,\n\n26\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.560\nat least that's what I'm calling them.\n\n27\n00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.670\nYou can call them collapse expand buttons,\nthey're little arrows but\n\n28\n00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.660\nthey look like carrots to me so-\n&gt;&gt; I would also typify that as a carrot.\n\n29\n00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.620\nI'd say carrots for the little up and\n\n30\n00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.400\ndown arrows so yeah,\nI'm gonna go with it, we'll go with it.\n\n31\n00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.350\n&gt;&gt; And I don't know if it's like a coding\nthing or just a keyboard thing or it's,\n\n32\n00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.510\nyou know what?\n\n33\n00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.043\nYou can name it anything you want, but\nit's those little icons to the right,\n\n34\n00:01:49.043 --> 00:01:52.710\nthat would be the other right\n[LAUGH] of some of these folders.\n\n35\n00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.620\nSo there it just means that\nthere's more things to it.\n\n36\n00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.000\nAlso known as what I'm\nstarting to hover over things\n\n37\n00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.190\nespecially over here on the left hand side\nthere's this little stars that come up\n\n38\n00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.170\ncuz that has to indicate with what's\nover here which are favorites.\n\n39\n00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.950\nWe think about I think a lot of times\nyou actually have it right up here,\n\n40\n00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.940\nthe star on your address bar\nto add to your favorites.\n\n41\n00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.130\nSo it's nice they're keeping with\nthe same theme going with stars\n\n42\n00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.450\nbecause over on our left\nhand file navigation pane,\n\n43\n00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.250\nyou can see that we have things that\nyou could mark as your favorites.\n\n44\n00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.070\nRight now, the only thing that's\nin our favorites is our inbox.\n\n45\n00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.185\nBut maybe there are specific folders that\nyou've created cuz you can create your\n\n46\n00:02:34.185 --> 00:02:39.625\nown custom folders for organization cuz,\nwe keep calling these folders and\n\n47\n00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:43.115\nthey are and I always equate it\nback to well you have a desk.\n\n48\n00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:46.350\nLike a physical desk that you sit at and\nyou have a drawer and\n\n49\n00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.600\nyou have file folders, and\nthey are compartmentalized into\n\n50\n00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.090\ndifferent things that, these are the taxes\nfor this year, taxes for another year.\n\n51\n00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.130\nCuz that's pretty much the only\nthing I keep in my file folder.\n\n52\n00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.150\n&gt;&gt; I was going along with you there\nVonne until your brought up taxes, and\n\n53\n00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.315\nthen I kinda got sad.\n\n54\n00:03:00.315 --> 00:03:03.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yeah we tend to,\n\n55\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.510\nwhatever we do we divide them up in the\nlogical units that make sense to us and\n\n56\n00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.890\nthat's what these are reflecting.\n\n57\n00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.960\nThey're not necessarily physical folders\nthat you would see like on your desktop or\n\n58\n00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.590\nsomething because well,\nhow would you add to [INAUDIBLE].\n\n59\n00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.330\nIt's kind of I would add\nfolders inside of folders and\n\n60\n00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.346\nif you haven't truly have that\nhappen you may have some fun times.\n\n61\n00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:23.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can just click for days.\n\n62\n00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.425\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n63\n00:03:24.425 --> 00:03:25.900\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it is a logical\n\n64\n00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.140\norganizational thing.\n\n65\n00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.000\n&gt;&gt; And we can make our own folders to\nput things in and that's where for\n\n66\n00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.340\nexample, my inbox,\n\n67\n00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.030\nyou might be looking at yours like I\ndon't have that carrot thing to the left.\n\n68\n00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.938\nWhy do you have it?\n\n69\n00:03:36.938 --> 00:03:38.920\nBecause if I click on it,\n\n70\n00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.060\nit's actually expanding out to show you\nthat I have created my own folders.\n\n71\n00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.070\nIn here for me to organize myself,\nbecause I could say hey,\n\n72\n00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.030\nany messages that's coming in from JT,\nI wanna put them in JT folder that's\n\n73\n00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.510\ninside of the inbox folder and\nI could, like Justin was saying,\n\n74\n00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.480\nI could put folders inside of\nfolders to keep myself organized.\n\n75\n00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.750\nWhatever floats your boat,\n\n76\n00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.330\nwhatever makes your life easier\n&gt;&gt; Some people like to like super\n\n77\n00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.190\norganized, micro-level, some people just\nkeep everything in the same place and\n\n78\n00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.100\nhave naming conventions or\ntheir own kind of system.\n\n79\n00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.510\nYour system, your rules, that's fine.\n\n80\n00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.860\nJust go ahead and make sure that Outlook\nmatches that and it's working for you and\n\n81\n00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.770\nnot against you, and then sometimes it can\nstart to work against us a little bit.\n\n82\n00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.520\nBut that's why I have\nthese carrot things and\n\n83\n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.011\nthe different names next to\nthem that you might not see.\n\n84\n00:04:31.011 --> 00:04:34.190\nThe numbers to the right hand side,\nI'm trying to hover over it so\n\n85\n00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.950\nyou could see it but every time I hover\nover it the little star comes up,\n\n86\n00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.250\nlike the drafts folder.\n\n87\n00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.940\nSo what is a drafts folder to start with?\n\n88\n00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.890\nThat's where you keep all your saved\nemails, like hey I'm typing an email but\n\n89\n00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.030\nI got to run to lunch or I got\na phone call and I wanna save that and\n\n90\n00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.100\nbe able to bring it back up later and then\nsend it off, that's your drafts folder.\n\n91\n00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.980\nAnd a lot of times you're gonna type\nin emails that will automatically\n\n92\n00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.670\nsave in your drafts folder and when we get\ninto actually composing mail you'll be\n\n93\n00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.560\nable to see those things that pop up on\nthe righthand side that says, autosave and\n\n94\n00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.020\nhas like the timestamp for you.\n\n95\n00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.135\nBut the number next to it indicates\nhow many items are in that folder,\n\n96\n00:05:13.135 --> 00:05:14.210\nyou're like there's only two.\n\n97\n00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.210\nWell for this particular folder,\nthe drafts folder, yes there is only two.\n\n98\n00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.750\nIn the deleted items what do you\nthink deleted items there for?\n\n99\n00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.120\nWell its for\nthe things you wanna throw away.\n\n100\n00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.620\nIt's like your trash can off the side but\nyou haven't actually taken it out to\n\n101\n00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.440\nthe dumpster and the dump truck takes it\nto the landfill, so just sitting there.\n\n102\n00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.080\nThat has a number 5.\n\n103\n00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.190\nDoes that mean there's\nonly 5 items in there?\n\n104\n00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.980\nNo.\nAnd those that this number is bold and\n\n105\n00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.590\nit's a different color than the number 2\nnext to the draft folder because that's\n\n106\n00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.050\njust telling me that that's how many\nunread emails I have in the deleted items.\n\n107\n00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.830\nI didn't even read them.\n\n108\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.770\nI threw them into the trash\ncuz I didn't need that.\n\n109\n00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.370\nSo that's why you have\nthose highlighted numbers.\n\n110\n00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.980\nAnd if I had actual emails in my\ninbox that I have not read yet,\n\n111\n00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.350\nthe received, I would have a number and\nit would be in bold and\n\n112\n00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.860\nwhatever color scheme you have,\ncuz if yours is pink you might\n\n113\n00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.370\nhave the pink cat themes that I would\nnormally have but I went with the blocks.\n\n114\n00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.740\nSo that's what the numbers mean\nnext to these different folders.\n\n115\n00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.910\nKeeping on, moving down hm, sent items.\n\n116\n00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.070\nProbably for your Sent items, exactly.\n\n117\n00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.940\nAnd you can click on it.\n\n118\n00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.540\nWhy don't I go ahead and\n\n119\n00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.970\nclick on it now to notice that your\nfolder list or your message list.\n\n120\n00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.400\nThat's what we should call it.\n\n121\n00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.320\nNow it changed to show me\neverything that's in my Sent items.\n\n122\n00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.420\nClicking on Drafts takes me\ninto the Drafts folder and\n\n123\n00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.480\nit actually puts Draft in those\nlittle square brackets there to\n\n124\n00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.560\nlet me know that this is not a completed\nmessage and it is just waiting there.\n\n125\n00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.250\nClicking back on my inbox,\n\n126\n00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.990\nI can see that my message list is\nshowing me whatever is in my inbox.\n\n127\n00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.240\nSo that same thing we talked\nabout in the interface of hey\n\n128\n00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.960\nmake sure you know where you're at in your\nbrowser as to what tab you are in and\n\n129\n00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.300\nwhere you're at, the same thing in each\narea of Outlook that you're using.\n\n130\n00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.140\nAm I in my inbox?\n\n131\n00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.730\nThere's so many times where I'm like,\nI just can't find, I'm in the sent items.\n\n132\n00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.180\nThat's why I can't find it,\ncuz I'm not in the right area.\n\n133\n00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.410\nMoving on down,\nwe have some other folders down here.\n\n134\n00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.890\nConversation history, now that's something\nthat is directly connected to Skype for\n\n135\n00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:25.440\nBusiness and if you have Skype\nmessages that you're sending back and\n\n136\n00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.350\nforth, it's like your chat functionality.\n\n137\n00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.561\nBut it is a separate application we'll\ncall it, but it is built in to our web\n\n138\n00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:38.610\ninterface as well and you do have to\nhave a specific subscription level of\n\n139\n00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.856\nOffice 365 to have Skype or even have\na conversation to history folder.\n\n140\n00:07:43.856 --> 00:07:49.251\nSo if you don't see it, you're not\nnecessarily missing anything, you just\n\n141\n00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:55.069\ndon't have that feature of that particular\nprescription level of Office 365.\n\n142\n00:07:55.069 --> 00:07:56.267\nYeah, they're junk mail.\n\n143\n00:07:56.267 --> 00:08:00.870\nThis is where you have, now like I said\nin here, junk will have a specific\n\n144\n00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.804\nepisode going over junk mail and\nhow to control the junk mail.\n\n145\n00:08:04.804 --> 00:08:07.895\nAnd the different ways\nthat you can kinda keep\n\n146\n00:08:07.895 --> 00:08:11.078\nyour inbox from being\nflooded with junk mail.\n\n147\n00:08:11.078 --> 00:08:13.153\n&gt;&gt; One quick aside, though.\n\n148\n00:08:13.153 --> 00:08:16.504\nYou should always periodically check it\neven if you haven't done any settings.\n\n149\n00:08:16.504 --> 00:08:20.061\nCuz I can't tell you how many times\nI've been like, someone's like, hey,\n\n150\n00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:22.323\nI sent you that email\nabout our lunch date.\n\n151\n00:08:22.323 --> 00:08:22.851\nNo, you didn't.\n\n152\n00:08:22.851 --> 00:08:24.759\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And they're like, no,\n\n153\n00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:25.563\nI'm sure I sent it to you.\n\n154\n00:08:25.563 --> 00:08:27.464\nAnd then I click on the junk mail and\nthere it is.\n\n155\n00:08:27.464 --> 00:08:29.059\nIt's been sitting there for two weeks.\n\n156\n00:08:29.059 --> 00:08:32.963\nSo always just randomly check\nthat like every two days or so.\n\n157\n00:08:32.963 --> 00:08:37.055\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I'm completely guilty of that\nbecause even today when I was checking out\n\n158\n00:08:37.055 --> 00:08:40.737\nsome stuff and I was doing some prepping\nbefore these episodes it's like,\n\n159\n00:08:40.737 --> 00:08:43.271\nokay let's make sure I've\ngot some things set up.\n\n160\n00:08:43.271 --> 00:08:48.189\nI was sending email from\nthe Outlook.com account,\n\n161\n00:08:48.189 --> 00:08:52.667\nmy vonne_opdc [LAUGH],\nfor Office Pro Demo Co.\n\n162\n00:08:52.667 --> 00:08:55.147\nI'm like, why is it,\nI know I'm sending it to Joey.\n\n163\n00:08:55.147 --> 00:08:58.404\nI'm like refreshing, I'm doing all those\nstuff and like, is something broke?\n\n164\n00:08:58.404 --> 00:09:00.060\nI'm going through my settings.\n\n165\n00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.953\nIt took me like a good\nten minutes before I went\n\n166\n00:09:03.953 --> 00:09:07.262\nI'm getting sent into the junk mail.\n\n167\n00:09:07.262 --> 00:09:09.606\nOkay it doesn't recognize that.\n\n168\n00:09:09.606 --> 00:09:13.793\nSo I almost broke the cardinal rule\nof always check your junk mail.\n\n169\n00:09:13.793 --> 00:09:16.438\nAnd so I was being junked.\n\n170\n00:09:16.438 --> 00:09:19.212\nSo, [LAUGH] definitely\nmake sure you check that.\n\n171\n00:09:19.212 --> 00:09:22.916\nYou also have it, we keep on going down\nthe left hand side, you have Notes.\n\n172\n00:09:22.916 --> 00:09:27.443\nIn the desktop version of Outlook,\nNotes is like a separate area.\n\n173\n00:09:27.443 --> 00:09:30.557\nLike I actually have\nan episode on Tasks and Notes.\n\n174\n00:09:30.557 --> 00:09:34.343\nNotes is not separate here,\nit's just over in like a folder.\n\n175\n00:09:34.343 --> 00:09:39.754\nAnd these are ones, since this is my\nOffice 365 account, and I did a whole show\n\n176\n00:09:39.754 --> 00:09:45.181\nfor the desktop version before I started\nfilming the Outlook on the web version.\n\n177\n00:09:45.181 --> 00:09:49.604\nSo I made notes on that desktop version,\nthat's why I have it in here and\n\n178\n00:09:49.604 --> 00:09:52.056\nthey're just, well, little notes.\n\n179\n00:09:52.056 --> 00:09:54.200\nThat's all there is to it.\n\n180\n00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.323\nKeep on going down, Groups.\n\n181\n00:09:56.323 --> 00:09:58.319\nYou might not have Groups either.\n\n182\n00:09:58.319 --> 00:10:00.459\nGroups are,\nGroups are actually really cool.\n\n183\n00:10:00.459 --> 00:10:03.592\nGroups are, [LAUGH] groups are groups.\n\n184\n00:10:03.592 --> 00:10:07.515\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I couldn't have said it better myself,\n\n185\n00:10:07.515 --> 00:10:08.095\nVonne.\n\n186\n00:10:08.095 --> 00:10:08.982\nGroups are groups.\n\n187\n00:10:08.982 --> 00:10:10.256\n&gt;&gt; They are.\n&gt;&gt; They are in fact that.\n\n188\n00:10:10.256 --> 00:10:13.331\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and\nthat they're exactly what they sound like.\n\n189\n00:10:13.331 --> 00:10:17.638\nHere is that, you can create a group\nthat you have specific people in,\n\n190\n00:10:17.638 --> 00:10:19.692\nlike within your organization.\n\n191\n00:10:19.692 --> 00:10:22.031\nThe cool thing is it's like,\nit's like their own little click.\n\n192\n00:10:22.031 --> 00:10:26.954\nThey have their own inbox,\nthey have their mail\n\n193\n00:10:26.954 --> 00:10:31.880\naddress like it might\nbe host@itprotv.com or\n\n194\n00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:39.036\nmarketing@officeprodemoco, and\nyou can create that on your own.\n\n195\n00:10:39.036 --> 00:10:42.060\nYou get your own calendar, so\nyou have a group calendar,\n\n196\n00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.652\nyou have some group,\nyou have a group One Drive.\n\n197\n00:10:44.652 --> 00:10:48.652\nSo it's your own kind of, it's almost\nlike your own Intranet, if you wanna\n\n198\n00:10:48.652 --> 00:10:52.478\ncall it like it's your own central\ngroup and then you can work within it.\n\n199\n00:10:52.478 --> 00:10:58.166\nAnd I have a couple that are created here,\nand so I've used this for demonstration.\n\n200\n00:10:58.166 --> 00:11:01.719\nSo same function as you have\nin the desktop version,\n\n201\n00:11:01.719 --> 00:11:06.098\nyou have in the web version and\nthat's what a group is all about.\n\n202\n00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:09.503\nSo that's what I have over here\non my left navigation folder and\n\n203\n00:11:09.503 --> 00:11:14.000\nhow we can go through our Favorites, I'm\njust looking at my notes really quickly,\n\n204\n00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.560\nmake sure I got everything.\n\n205\n00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:21.170\nPerfect, so now let's talk about some of\nour default views of now we know where\n\n206\n00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:27.129\nour folders are, what about this message\nlist and this right hand thing over here?\n\n207\n00:11:27.129 --> 00:11:28.528\nYep, that's descriptive.\n\n208\n00:11:28.528 --> 00:11:30.848\nLet's go back to that Inbox.\n\n209\n00:11:30.848 --> 00:11:32.944\nThe thing over here on the right,\nthis big area?\n\n210\n00:11:32.944 --> 00:11:34.181\nThis is your reading pane.\n\n211\n00:11:34.181 --> 00:11:37.874\nYour reading pane allows you\nto read the emails right here.\n\n212\n00:11:37.874 --> 00:11:42.549\nNow, this is what the default\nsetting is of our mail interface.\n\n213\n00:11:42.549 --> 00:11:44.308\nSome people don't like the reading pane.\n\n214\n00:11:44.308 --> 00:11:47.198\nNow I can see pros and cons for them.\n\n215\n00:11:47.198 --> 00:11:50.985\nI always have it on just cuz I usually\ndon't mess with the defaults too much,\n\n216\n00:11:50.985 --> 00:11:53.307\nespecially since I teach\nall these products.\n\n217\n00:11:53.307 --> 00:11:56.577\nI wanna make sure I keep it\nin the way that it starts, so\n\n218\n00:11:56.577 --> 00:11:58.772\nI've just kinda gotten used to it.\n\n219\n00:11:58.772 --> 00:12:03.332\nBut that thing is the reading pane,\nyou can turn it off In your settings.\n\n220\n00:12:03.332 --> 00:12:06.231\nWe'll get back into that\njust a little bit later.\n\n221\n00:12:06.231 --> 00:12:09.606\nLet's focus over here on our Message List.\n\n222\n00:12:09.606 --> 00:12:12.601\nLet's start it, the focused mailbox.\n\n223\n00:12:12.601 --> 00:12:17.952\nThis particular mailbox is\nset up as a focused inbox.\n\n224\n00:12:17.952 --> 00:12:22.707\nNow at the time of this recording,\nthis is where they had actually\n\n225\n00:12:22.707 --> 00:12:27.633\nstarted to make the shift from\nthe older interface if you wanna say,\n\n226\n00:12:27.633 --> 00:12:32.128\nand this is like the new interface\nof Outlook trying to help you\n\n227\n00:12:32.128 --> 00:12:35.347\nfocus on emails that\nmostly pertain to you.\n\n228\n00:12:35.347 --> 00:12:40.519\nAnd put all that Junk, now it's\nnot junk mail but it's other mail.\n\n229\n00:12:40.519 --> 00:12:41.865\nAnd so they separate it out.\n\n230\n00:12:41.865 --> 00:12:45.320\nIt's Outlook trying to be intelligent for\nus.\n\n231\n00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.524\nIt's the whole kind of smartness, wow!\n\n232\n00:12:49.524 --> 00:12:55.397\nThe smartness of like just\nhelping you not be so cluttered.\n\n233\n00:12:55.397 --> 00:12:57.182\nAnd they've went to this item.\n\n234\n00:12:57.182 --> 00:12:58.578\nNow you have different areas.\n\n235\n00:12:58.578 --> 00:13:00.325\nYou have Focused and you have Others.\n\n236\n00:13:00.325 --> 00:13:02.845\nBut notice what's in this\nOthers section over here,\n\n237\n00:13:02.845 --> 00:13:05.823\nlike the Microsoft Online Service Teams,\nMicrosoft Office.\n\n238\n00:13:05.823 --> 00:13:09.553\nIt's things that,\nwhere it's not necessarily junk, but\n\n239\n00:13:09.553 --> 00:13:12.546\nit's probably not stuff\nyou need all the time.\n\n240\n00:13:12.546 --> 00:13:16.089\nNow it is doing this on its own and\nyou can control this.\n\n241\n00:13:16.089 --> 00:13:20.104\nSo say, hey stop going to the Other,\ngo over to the Focused.\n\n242\n00:13:20.104 --> 00:13:23.127\nOr stop being Focused\ngo over to the Other.\n\n243\n00:13:23.127 --> 00:13:24.378\nOr you can send it to your junk mails.\n\n244\n00:13:24.378 --> 00:13:28.821\nThese are all specific settings that we\nwill focus on in the junk mail episode and\n\n245\n00:13:28.821 --> 00:13:32.085\nget a little bit more into like\nhow do I do all of that stuff?\n\n246\n00:13:32.085 --> 00:13:36.948\nBut for right now, that's how they're\nusing this in this default view\n\n247\n00:13:36.948 --> 00:13:41.824\nI'm gonna go back over to focus\nunderneath that they have your agenda.\n\n248\n00:13:41.824 --> 00:13:45.475\nI do like this part because it's\nshowing us what's on our calendar.\n\n249\n00:13:45.475 --> 00:13:46.077\nAnd hey, guess what?\n\n250\n00:13:46.077 --> 00:13:50.838\nThere's a brownie social in the break\nroom, Justin, in 11 minutes.\n\n251\n00:13:50.838 --> 00:13:53.088\n&gt;&gt; That does sound delicious to me.\n\n252\n00:13:53.088 --> 00:13:56.245\nThat's the second time today you've\nsaid something about brownies, and\n\n253\n00:13:56.245 --> 00:13:58.210\nthen I'm just like mmm, that's delicious.\n\n254\n00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:02.080\nBut while we're talking about it,\nbefore we get too excited about brownies,\n\n255\n00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.478\nI also wanna give a similar warning\nto the other pane, the other tab,\n\n256\n00:14:05.478 --> 00:14:06.665\nas I did with junk mail.\n\n257\n00:14:06.665 --> 00:14:11.567\nIt's really bad, cuz you're like\nI'm not getting any emails.\n\n258\n00:14:11.567 --> 00:14:15.195\nAnd then there's actually stuff in the\nother tab that may be important to you.\n\n259\n00:14:15.195 --> 00:14:17.913\nIt's trying to be helpful by saying,\nall right,\n\n260\n00:14:17.913 --> 00:14:20.059\nhere's all of your mail in your inbox.\n\n261\n00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:23.307\nThe focused ones are probably\nthe things that you really care about.\n\n262\n00:14:23.307 --> 00:14:27.460\nAnd the other ones, well,\ntheir probably sort of important, but\n\n263\n00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.843\nit's not in your forefront, right?\n\n264\n00:14:29.843 --> 00:14:33.421\nIn your immediate field of view,\nso always check.\n\n265\n00:14:33.421 --> 00:14:37.487\nI know I've almost got in the habit every\nmorning, I'm like Focused, Other, cool,\n\n266\n00:14:37.487 --> 00:14:38.277\nlet it do it's.\n\n267\n00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:42.219\nI check it once a day just to make\nsure there's nothing crazy there, but\n\n268\n00:14:42.219 --> 00:14:43.677\ndo be careful about that.\n\n269\n00:14:43.677 --> 00:14:46.387\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do that especially with our\nwork mail because it's always coming from\n\n270\n00:14:46.387 --> 00:14:49.071\nTwitter and all of our social media\naccounts, and that's going into Other.\n\n271\n00:14:49.071 --> 00:14:53.270\nAnd there's something with my health\ninsurance, was something in there.\n\n272\n00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.380\nIt got sent over to Other,\nI'm like that's really important to me.\n\n273\n00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:01.363\nAnd it took two days after they sent\nit that I finally found that, so.\n\n274\n00:15:01.363 --> 00:15:05.157\nTalking about that agenda of keeping\nus like hey guess what's coming up.\n\n275\n00:15:05.157 --> 00:15:07.821\nThere is a reminder that just popped up,\nand\n\n276\n00:15:07.821 --> 00:15:12.501\nthat is connected to my calendar that's\nsaying, hey I set a reminder that ten\n\n277\n00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:16.108\nminutes before the Brownie\nsocial I wanted that reminder.\n\n278\n00:15:16.108 --> 00:15:18.186\nSo that's what's coming over\nhere on the right hand side.\n\n279\n00:15:18.186 --> 00:15:22.123\nAnd I could snooze it or\nI could go ahead and dismiss it,\n\n280\n00:15:22.123 --> 00:15:25.044\nI'm a big fan of the snooze button, so.\n\n281\n00:15:25.044 --> 00:15:29.298\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and dismiss that\nfor right now since we're focusing on\n\n282\n00:15:29.298 --> 00:15:33.569\nthe mail Interface and not the calendar\nsection, but I wanted to pop that up.\n\n283\n00:15:33.569 --> 00:15:35.800\nAnd it did pop up for us.\n\n284\n00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.155\nBack over in this message list,\nthe Focused and the Others and\n\n285\n00:15:40.155 --> 00:15:42.602\nhow are they organizing our mail.\n\n286\n00:15:42.602 --> 00:15:46.445\nIf I scroll down, see, there's this\nlittle kind of subheadings of last week.\n\n287\n00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:48.894\nI scroll down a little bit further,\ntwo weeks ago.\n\n288\n00:15:48.894 --> 00:15:54.546\nSo right now, this is being sorted\nby date and the newest on top.\n\n289\n00:15:54.546 --> 00:15:58.516\nYou can also see some of these in here,\nlike for example right there.\n\n290\n00:15:58.516 --> 00:16:01.897\nThere's that little caret again or\nthat triangle.\n\n291\n00:16:01.897 --> 00:16:04.064\nIs indicating what is that?\n\n292\n00:16:04.064 --> 00:16:07.560\nThis is also this mail\nthat we have right here.\n\n293\n00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.450\nIt's showing your messages\nin conversations.\n\n294\n00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:15.720\nConversations means if I'm having\na conversation of an email going back and\n\n295\n00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:21.647\nforth with replies, that it's showing all\nin one block that if I click the triangle,\n\n296\n00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:25.131\nit's going to expand out and\nshow me that thread.\n\n297\n00:16:25.131 --> 00:16:27.276\nThat's another kind of\nway people describe it,\n\n298\n00:16:27.276 --> 00:16:30.800\nthis is my email thread that's going back,\nand it's keeping it all together.\n\n299\n00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.270\nAll of these things whether\nyou want a focused inbox,\n\n300\n00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:38.680\nwhether you want it to be shown\nas conversations, or vice\n\n301\n00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:43.840\nversa would be in messages where each\nindividual message is by itself.\n\n302\n00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.039\nYou can control all of\nthat if you wanted to.\n\n303\n00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:52.350\nThat's over on that right hand side, the\nfilter, we'll call it a button over here.\n\n304\n00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.410\nThe sort by notice it's from date.\n\n305\n00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:01.491\nI could sort this by the subject,\nby the attachments, I could show\n\n306\n00:17:01.491 --> 00:17:07.412\nit as messages or conversation, and\nI could show it as a focused inbox or not.\n\n307\n00:17:07.412 --> 00:17:13.140\nAnd if I change this to messages,\nI personally, I prefer conversations.\n\n308\n00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:17.310\nI like to kinda keep everything together\nbecause if I start talking about this\n\n309\n00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:20.040\nJune online,\neach one comes in individually.\n\n310\n00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:25.640\nAnd you might have 4 or 5, 14,\n20 emails going back and forth.\n\n311\n00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.930\nI personally like conversations better.\n\n312\n00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:32.140\nSo I'm gonna just put that back, but\nI did wanna show you that is quite easy\n\n313\n00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.250\nto make it kinda go back and\nforth from that.\n\n314\n00:17:36.996 --> 00:17:38.724\nWell now I can't show it as conversations.\n\n315\n00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:42.860\nThat's okay because if you can't find it\nhere, you can always go to your settings.\n\n316\n00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:47.310\nAnd we're gonna end on those\nsettings to kind of focus on some.\n\n317\n00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:52.240\nI'm going to show you some ones\nthat I find particularly handy.\n\n318\n00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:57.160\nAnd I can turn off the focused inbox and\nnow, I don't have that focus in other.\n\n319\n00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.560\nIt's just all of my mail\nis coming in to my inbox.\n\n320\n00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.490\nI still have my junk mail,\nso don't forget that one.\n\n321\n00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:08.080\nBut they're not separating it out\ninto those different pieces, so\n\n322\n00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.350\nyou can always change that.\n\n323\n00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.540\nIn these mails, the message list,\n\n324\n00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.590\nyou do have a lot of icons that\nare gonna be popped up in here,\n\n325\n00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:22.520\nto where if I scroll down,\nthere's some with a little paper clip.\n\n326\n00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.720\nThat means that it has an attachment.\n\n327\n00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:30.080\nThis one right here, this one, the little\narrow, this means that I forwarded it.\n\n328\n00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.290\nI'm pretty sure that means I forwarded it.\n\n329\n00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.963\nOr maybe I replied to it.\n\n330\n00:18:33.963 --> 00:18:34.720\nThat's okay.\n\n331\n00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.690\nIt will let me know if I\nclick on the actual email,\n\n332\n00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.300\nthat it will give me the details.\n\n333\n00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.020\nI replied.\n\n334\n00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.390\nSo, the arrow going backward.\n\n335\n00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:45.430\nAnd, this is my little Info bar that\ncomes up when I click on the message,\n\n336\n00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:49.120\nand this handy reading pane\nis giving me those details.\n\n337\n00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.180\nAnd so, always looking at the email\ndetails can help you remember,\n\n338\n00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.280\nwas that a forward or was that a reply?\n\n339\n00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.140\nYou might see some things with some\ndifferent colored bars off to the side.\n\n340\n00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.245\nThat means it's a category.\n\n341\n00:19:01.245 --> 00:19:02.740\nNotice it different when I hover.\n\n342\n00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.250\nWhen I hover over my messages,\n\n343\n00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.930\nthat's giving me those quick things\nlike do I want to delete this?\n\n344\n00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.500\nDo I want to mark as unread?\n\n345\n00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.560\nAnd if I didn't know what they mean,\nI'm just doing that hover to discover,\n\n346\n00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.780\nto let me know what this is,\nwhether I can flag it or\n\n347\n00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:23.310\nI can pin this different places of how\nI can start helping me organize myself.\n\n348\n00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:27.286\nSo there's a lot of different icons\nthat come up, like that is a calendar.\n\n349\n00:19:27.286 --> 00:19:30.970\nI need to stop doing the hovering when I'm\ntrying to point something out to you guys.\n\n350\n00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:34.620\nThis is a calendar request and\nso on and so forth.\n\n351\n00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.580\nLots of different icons, some have\ndifferent colors with the flags and\n\n352\n00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:39.790\nthe importance.\n\n353\n00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:44.670\nSo we'll be going through all of these\ndifferent settings for your messages when\n\n354\n00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:50.170\nwe get into composing or actually creating\nour email basics in some future episodes.\n\n355\n00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.920\nBut wanted to point those out.\n\n356\n00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:58.300\nNotice as we pointed out in the Outlook\ninterface, your top menu bars or\n\n357\n00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.610\ncolumns, or navigation bar,\nwill give you different options,\n\n358\n00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:02.950\ndepending on what you're clicking on.\n\n359\n00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.780\nSo you click on a message, and\n\n360\n00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.410\nyou'll get things like,\ndo I want to reply all, delete?\n\n361\n00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:13.000\nYou also get this little dot dot dot your,\nellipses, off the top, that's not the top,\n\n362\n00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.090\nthat's the right.\n\n363\n00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:20.860\nAnd it will give even more options\nthat you can do with your messages.\n\n364\n00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.810\nQuick little side note\non any of these things,\n\n365\n00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:28.410\nwhether it's a message,\na folder in your folder pane.\n\n366\n00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:32.803\nA lot of times right clicking will give\nyou that same option which is sometimes\n\n367\n00:20:32.803 --> 00:20:36.620\nweird when you're web interface cuz when\nyou're web interface a lot of times if\n\n368\n00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.725\nyou're right clicking you're only\njust gonna get like open a new tab.\n\n369\n00:20:39.725 --> 00:20:44.510\nOr the different things that come up by\ndefault when you're in a browser, but\n\n370\n00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:49.220\nspecifically in this web application\nright clicking in this area will\n\n371\n00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.040\ngive you some different options.\n\n372\n00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:58.060\nSo definitely check that out as well,\nand then lastly are settings.\n\n373\n00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.090\nMaybe you don't want\nthe reading pane to come up.\n\n374\n00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:05.225\nMaybe you want something\nelse to do be different.\n\n375\n00:21:05.225 --> 00:21:08.468\n[LAUGH] Cuz I can't remember what I've,\nI know I said something else, but\n\n376\n00:21:08.468 --> 00:21:11.560\nI'm pretty sure it was-\n&gt;&gt; The conversations instead of individual\n\n377\n00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.076\nmessages.\n\n378\n00:21:12.076 --> 00:21:16.620\nAnd I tend to like conversation as well\nbecause you may have a conversation\n\n379\n00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.390\nover a series of time, over a time span.\n\n380\n00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.810\nAnd if it says messages, well I'm gonna\nhave to search through a bunch of things.\n\n381\n00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:27.820\nAnd if there's a difference of two\nweeks and I've gotten a lot of email,\n\n382\n00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:32.090\nwell the last one and\nthe first one may be distinctly apart.\n\n383\n00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:36.160\nBut if I group them by conversations,\nthen it's based on the most recent one,\n\n384\n00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.640\nand they're grouped together.\n\n385\n00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.450\nSo replies are nice, but\nhow do we get that back?\n\n386\n00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:42.435\nI want that back.\n\n387\n00:21:42.435 --> 00:21:45.200\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and I'm so glad you're here to\nkeep me on point, because I'm like,\n\n388\n00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.820\nI know I mentioned two things specifically\nabout going back to those settings.\n\n389\n00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.810\nSo yes, focused inbox,\n\n390\n00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:55.940\nlet's get into our mail settings by coming\nover here to our little wheelie guy.\n\n391\n00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.060\nAnd you come into our display settings.\n\n392\n00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:02.806\nIf you don't like display settings,\nyou can always go down behind my head and\n\n393\n00:22:02.806 --> 00:22:05.592\nget into all of the mail\nsettings down below.\n\n394\n00:22:05.592 --> 00:22:10.330\nBut, let's go to Display settings and hit\na few of those ones, because the ones that\n\n395\n00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:14.120\nhave the most commonly used\nitems like the display settings.\n\n396\n00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.090\nReading pane, perfect.\n\n397\n00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:19.900\nSo that's where I could hide the reading\npane cuz I don't want to have that here.\n\n398\n00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.501\nAnd notice it does say\napply to all folders,\n\n399\n00:22:22.501 --> 00:22:27.460\nso that means like our inbox,\nour sent items, our draft items.\n\n400\n00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:28.988\nIt will go across all of them.\n\n401\n00:22:28.988 --> 00:22:32.590\nIf you don't want it to be different then\nyou could always of course uncheck that,\n\n402\n00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.640\nchoose what happens when I move or\ndelete an item.\n\n403\n00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.230\nSo those are different options that\nyou could have with our reading pane.\n\n404\n00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:42.660\nLet's go over to our message list.\n\n405\n00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.595\nMaybe I don't want to have\nmy sender name on top.\n\n406\n00:22:45.595 --> 00:22:47.830\nI wanna have my subject line.\n\n407\n00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:48.540\nUp to you.\n\n408\n00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.010\nMaybe I don't wanna have any preview text.\n\n409\n00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:51.953\nI could hide the preview text.\n\n410\n00:22:51.953 --> 00:22:54.959\nThose are the ones where\nit give you that one line,\n\n411\n00:22:54.959 --> 00:22:58.696\nthe first line of that email to\ngive you just a little preview.\n\n412\n00:22:58.696 --> 00:23:00.697\nAnd so these are different\nparts that you can go through.\n\n413\n00:23:00.697 --> 00:23:03.490\nDisplay settings,\nthere's our conversations.\n\n414\n00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:08.470\nOkay, now this one it's like, okay, well\nthat's not exactly what I was looking for,\n\n415\n00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.630\nbut that's all right.\n\n416\n00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:12.480\nLet's click on,\nlet's go over to our focused inbox, and\n\n417\n00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:17.510\nlet's go to sort messages into focus,\nbecause I would like to have that.\n\n418\n00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:21.780\nNow, if I click OK here, and\nif you try to click off of it,\n\n419\n00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.170\nit will give you like, hey,\nyou've made some changes in your settings.\n\n420\n00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.040\nAnd do you want to actually\nsave that before you move on?\n\n421\n00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:33.470\nSo you will get a warning\nif you don't click that OK.\n\n422\n00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.290\nJust a few quick things where I'm here.\n\n423\n00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:36.973\nNotice how the reading pane is gone.\n\n424\n00:23:36.973 --> 00:23:41.120\nI get a lot more details\nin this particular view.\n\n425\n00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.610\nThis is where you could go\ninto in the desktop version.\n\n426\n00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:46.450\nGo to the view tab and go into details.\n\n427\n00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:52.540\nAnd now once I turn this into a focused\ninbox notice that my show conversations,\n\n428\n00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.400\nthat will give me that,\nso that focused inbox and\n\n429\n00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.370\nthat show conversations\nare kinda tied together.\n\n430\n00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:01.410\nSo I wanted to point that out, because\nI've done that a couple of times when I'm\n\n431\n00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:03.550\nlike, I wanna just go back\nto the conversations.\n\n432\n00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:08.060\nBut if you put it back to focused it will\ngive you it in this drop-down message and\n\n433\n00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:13.690\nyou can go ahead and organize all of\nyour Information by conversation.\n\n434\n00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:17.180\nSo we did the reading pane and\nwe did the show as conversations.\n\n435\n00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:22.218\nJust a couple quick more, a few more\nback over in settings, behind my head\n\n436\n00:24:22.218 --> 00:24:27.283\nthere's down at the bottom we have our\napp settings, and we go into mail.\n\n437\n00:24:27.283 --> 00:24:32.252\nSince we are talking about this\ninterface I did want to point out\n\n438\n00:24:32.252 --> 00:24:34.138\na mail section layout.\n\n439\n00:24:34.138 --> 00:24:36.877\nAnd in the layout that is\nwhere some of the stuff\n\n440\n00:24:36.877 --> 00:24:41.765\nwe already saw in the display settings,\nbut this is where some more things are in.\n\n441\n00:24:41.765 --> 00:24:46.685\nThere's our focused inbox, so\njust like any Office products there's\n\n442\n00:24:46.685 --> 00:24:49.585\nalways at least 15 ways\nto get to the same thing.\n\n443\n00:24:49.585 --> 00:24:51.135\nSo there's that one.\n\n444\n00:24:51.135 --> 00:24:54.183\nAnd then the message list.\n\n445\n00:24:54.183 --> 00:24:56.181\nThis is the one I wanted to show you.\n\n446\n00:24:56.181 --> 00:25:00.645\nThe same thing that I was talking about\nin the display settings that hide,\n\n447\n00:25:00.645 --> 00:25:02.075\npreview and the next calendar.\n\n448\n00:25:02.075 --> 00:25:06.590\nSo all of these different parts that\nI had got to in display settings,\n\n449\n00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:11.920\nanother way you could get to it, and how\nyou can control your interface to match\n\n450\n00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.150\nhow you want your mail or\nOutlook to work for you.\n\n451\n00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.511\nSo, there you go.\n\n452\n00:25:18.511 --> 00:25:19.253\nLots of lots of settings.\n\n453\n00:25:19.253 --> 00:25:22.200\n&gt;&gt; Well I'll tell ya,\nI'm gonna need a nap after that.\n\n454\n00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.000\nI was unprepared for\n\n455\n00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.830\nthe amount of configuration that\nwe could actually go through.\n\n456\n00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.240\nAnd honestly I'm gonna tell you,\n\n457\n00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.720\nI'm probably gonna go back\nto my desk here shortly, and\n\n458\n00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.110\nchange a few of those settings myself,\ncuz I'm like, I want that.\n\n459\n00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:35.120\nI want that.\n\n460\n00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.440\nSo, wonderful wonderful information there,\nbut\n\n461\n00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.420\nI know we have a great deal more coming at\nyou, so you should definitely stay tuned.\n\n462\n00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.881\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for Alpha's Pro TV.\n\n463\n00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:45.370\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n464\n00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:46.200\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n465\n00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.769\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n466\n00:25:47.769 -->

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.610\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.840\nAnd well, we're coming right back at\nyou with more Outlook on the web.\n\n5\n00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.400\nSpecifically, well we're gonna\nstart diving into sending and\n\n6\n00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.750\nreceiving email, and who knows what\nother shenanigans we'll get into.\n\n7\n00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.910\nBut here to help us with that very\ntopic is our one and only Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.930\nHow you doing today Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.389\n&gt;&gt; I'm great.\nI'm ready for all the shenanigans.\n\n10\n00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:26.978\n[LAUGH].\n\n11\n00:00:26.978 --> 00:00:29.366\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do love a good shenanigans.\n\n12\n00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.318\n&gt;&gt; I do too.\nAnd I love a good email, and\n\n13\n00:00:31.318 --> 00:00:35.820\na nice response, and I like an attachment,\nand all those wonderful things.\n\n14\n00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.300\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and\ncover everything that we need to know,\n\n15\n00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.098\nto just have basic email exchanges.\n\n16\n00:00:41.098 --> 00:00:43.100\nWe're gonna be composing some messages.\n\n17\n00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.570\nI'm not gonna too crazy into formatting,\njust a quick hey, how's it going?\n\n18\n00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.110\nAnd then we'll say hello to our friend,\n\n19\n00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.180\nand then they'll reply back and\nall of that.\n\n20\n00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.700\nAnd I broke this up into three parts so\nthere will be part one, and two and three.\n\n21\n00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.568\nAnd with this one,\n\n22\n00:00:56.568 --> 00:01:00.422\nwe're going to concentrate on just like\na single recipient, just one person we're\n\n23\n00:01:00.422 --> 00:01:03.856\ngonna email, and how to go back and\nforth with it, and how to attach a file.\n\n24\n00:01:03.856 --> 00:01:07.033\nSo those are the main topics\nwe're gonna be covering,\n\n25\n00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:10.705\nso why don't we jump in to\nJoey's Outlook on the web right now.\n\n26\n00:01:10.705 --> 00:01:12.671\nIt's his Office 365 Subscription.\n\n27\n00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:17.791\nAnd actually let me take a small\nlittle side veer for a second,\n\n28\n00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:24.787\nthat everything that we're going to be\ncovering in these basic emailing episodes,\n\n29\n00:01:24.787 --> 00:01:30.150\nthey will work for\nboth the Office 365 and the Outlook.com.\n\n30\n00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.880\nSo there's really not much difference.\n\n31\n00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.140\nThere's a few things that might\nchange in like the menus,\n\n32\n00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.610\nI know in one thing in the Outlook.com,\nit says like my friend has been hacked.\n\n33\n00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.700\nI thought that was one of the cutest\noptions in the drop down menu.\n\n34\n00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.300\nI was like so\nyou're trying to keep your friend safe.\n\n35\n00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.560\nAnd like hey,\nthis is not coming from the same person.\n\n36\n00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.730\nSo when we get into that button\nthen we apply to an email,\n\n37\n00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.570\nthat might be the biggest difference\nyou're gonna see between the two versions.\n\n38\n00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.960\nAnd then when we start\ntalking about attachments,\n\n39\n00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.090\nthere's some other things on the storage\nside that you might see in Outlook.com.\n\n40\n00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.880\nOnce we get to it,\nyou'll know what I'm talking about.\n\n41\n00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.340\nSo we're gonna stay, I'm gonna stay\nstrictly in Office 365 for these episodes.\n\n42\n00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.190\nSo, Joey's inbox I actually left this,\nI did a little changing here.\n\n43\n00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.410\nI don't have the reading\npane on right now.\n\n44\n00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.940\nSo I'm just having it in what\nkind of looks like detailed view,\n\n45\n00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.598\nif you're used to looking at\nthis the desktop version.\n\n46\n00:02:22.598 --> 00:02:25.460\nI figured I'd change up\nthe view a little bit and\n\n47\n00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.360\ngive us a different\noutlook on our Outlook.\n\n48\n00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.820\nWhat do I wanna do to\ncompose a new message?\n\n49\n00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.930\nI'm in my inbox or\nat least somewhere within the mail area.\n\n50\n00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.740\nWhether I am in sent mail or\nI'm in junk mail,\n\n51\n00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.410\nyou'll still have that\nNew button at the top.\n\n52\n00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.130\nSince I'm starting from the beginning,\nI'd just like to go ahead and\n\n53\n00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.390\nget back into the inbox, so\n\n54\n00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.970\nI can see all of the messages that\nI've already received from people.\n\n55\n00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.160\nSo I clicked on the New button, and\nit goes ahead and starts our new message\n\n56\n00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.880\narea, I should say in the reading\npane like right in this area.\n\n57\n00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.900\nI said reading pane but I've just\ntold you that reading pane's off, so\n\n58\n00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.110\ntechnically not a reading pane what's were\ngonna call this main area, how about that?\n\n59\n00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.520\nAnd you can stay in here and\nbe totally fine with it.\n\n60\n00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.410\nBut the two buttons I wanna show you over\ntowards the right hand side, over here.\n\n61\n00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.340\nYou have what looks like two little\nwindows, and you have an x, and\n\n62\n00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.060\nyou can see if I'm hovering over it,\nit says Save and Close.\n\n63\n00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.220\nI missed the hover.\n\n64\n00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.778\nThere we go Save and Close.\n\n65\n00:03:29.778 --> 00:03:33.392\nSo that way if you're like I don't wanna\nstart a new message, I'm not ready,\n\n66\n00:03:33.392 --> 00:03:35.733\njust hit the x and\nit's gonna go ahead and close that.\n\n67\n00:03:35.733 --> 00:03:37.157\nBut it does say Save,\n\n68\n00:03:37.157 --> 00:03:41.351\none thing I'll just go ahead and\nsay right now before we start,\n\n69\n00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:46.829\nis when you start composing messages in\nOutlook on the web, it saves all the time.\n\n70\n00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.290\nUnlike the auto save setting\nsettings on the desktop,\n\n71\n00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.510\nI think it's a couple minutes,\nI think the default's three minutes.\n\n72\n00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.190\nSo it doesn't always go into\nyour Drafts right away.\n\n73\n00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.293\nBut just know that it will\nbe saving all the time.\n\n74\n00:03:58.293 --> 00:04:01.050\nAnd when we come into explaining\nabout our Drafts folder,\n\n75\n00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.763\nyou might see a ton of messages that you\nnever started, you never addressed but\n\n76\n00:04:04.763 --> 00:04:07.580\nthey're all still hanging\nout in the Drafts folder.\n\n77\n00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.220\nThat's something that this\nparticular web version of Outlook.\n\n78\n00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.820\nIt does a little bit more, at least\nthat's what I've noticed from myself.\n\n79\n00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.390\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne.\n\n80\n00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.830\nI do wanna jump in there.\n\n81\n00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.960\nIt may seem a little annoying,\nthis kind of always saving these and\n\n82\n00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.090\nyou have to manage it.\n\n83\n00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.050\nBut I can't tell you how\nmany countless times,\n\n84\n00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.720\nthat I've either start at something and\nwaited to save, let me hold off.\n\n85\n00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.140\nIt's almost like a little reminder for\nme, but also since the autosaves always\n\n86\n00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:39.020\nhappening, power goes out,\nno or internet goes down, no.\n\n87\n00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.070\nAnd just keep in mind,\nit's auto-saving and increments, right?\n\n88\n00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.010\nYou may not get everything but\nit does a pretty good job, and\n\n89\n00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.040\nit saved me from those giant email\ncompositions just going into the.\n\n90\n00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.200\nSo it's handy, even though at times\nit may seem a little too much.\n\n91\n00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.563\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like a good/bad situation.\n\n92\n00:04:59.563 --> 00:05:02.391\nIt could be bad,\nI don't think it's really that bad, but\n\n93\n00:05:02.391 --> 00:05:05.700\nit could clutter up my Drafts folder and\nI have a habit of doing that.\n\n94\n00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.649\nYou'll actually see it\nwhen we get into it,\n\n95\n00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:10.190\nthat I have a bunch of\nmessages that I've started.\n\n96\n00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.080\nBut that is why the button\nwhen you're hovering over it,\n\n97\n00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.080\nit's saying Save and Close,\nbecause it's kind of odd.\n\n98\n00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.420\nNormally when we see x's\nyou just think close, so\n\n99\n00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.160\nthat's why I wanted to really,\nreally explain why that hover\n\n100\n00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.530\nto discover is giving us that prompt\nof what that button is doing.\n\n101\n00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.500\nThe other button next to it on the left,\nthis is the Edit in a separate window or\n\n102\n00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.650\nsometimes they call it a pop out window.\n\n103\n00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.077\nSo you could keep it here.\n\n104\n00:05:35.077 --> 00:05:36.479\nNo problem with that.\n\n105\n00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.279\nBut sometimes, you might wanna pop it out\n\n106\n00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:43.600\ninto its own browser window to be\nable to maybe see more buttons.\n\n107\n00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.220\nMaybe the resolution on your monitor,\ndoesn't allow for\n\n108\n00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.160\nall the buttons down at the bottom\nof the formatting options.\n\n109\n00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.850\nAnd you wanna see everything?\n\n110\n00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.810\nTotally fine.\n\n111\n00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.000\nI will give you one little\nnotice at least from me.\n\n112\n00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.500\nMaybe all those connections\nare a little bit faster.\n\n113\n00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.470\nI am on a Virtual Machine\non my Mackintosh computer.\n\n114\n00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.690\nWhen I click this button,\nit takes a while.\n\n115\n00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.228\nCome on you can do, there you go.\n\n116\n00:06:07.228 --> 00:06:09.970\n[LAUGH] It's slow.\n\n117\n00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.850\nMaybe it won't be as slow for\nyou when you click that pop-up button,\n\n118\n00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.060\nbut there's times when I'm like wait,\ndid I click it?\n\n119\n00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.290\nI click it again and I'm like wow,\n\n120\n00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.470\nI just did the thing that\nI tell people not to do.\n\n121\n00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.995\nJust click it and wait.\n\n122\n00:06:21.995 --> 00:06:25.290\nBut it takes a while for my computer.\n\n123\n00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:30.130\n&gt;&gt; To help quell any of those fears,\nit works fairly expeditiously for me.\n\n124\n00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.280\nSo I don't have a real slow down.\n\n125\n00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.500\nNow, that depends on internet\nconnectivity and some external factors.\n\n126\n00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.248\nSo your situation may vary.\n\n127\n00:06:37.248 --> 00:06:39.596\nDon't say hey,\nJustin told me it's gonna be fast.\n\n128\n00:06:39.596 --> 00:06:40.432\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no,\n\n129\n00:06:40.432 --> 00:06:44.520\nI said it's fast for me, not necessarily\nfor you, so keep that in mind.\n\n130\n00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.462\n&gt;&gt; It's slow for me in my situation,\nso you might not have any problem.\n\n131\n00:06:48.462 --> 00:06:51.570\nBut do be aware that now I'm\nin a new browser window, so\n\n132\n00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.557\nwatching your task bar down at\nthe bottom or if you're in a Macintosh,\n\n133\n00:06:55.557 --> 00:07:00.890\nmaking sure you're just watching like what\nwindow I am in right now, what am I doing.\n\n134\n00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:06.680\nBecause, this is where you also don't\nget the same areas around your message.\n\n135\n00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.230\nLike with the top header navigation,\nthe folder pane.\n\n136\n00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:14.580\nSo sometimes its nice to just focus right\non the message that I am trying to send.\n\n137\n00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.322\nSo, it's a little bit bigger here for\nus in demonstration mode.\n\n138\n00:07:17.322 --> 00:07:20.640\nSo what am I'm gonna do in this\nnew composing message window?\n\n139\n00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.640\nWell I'm going to address it to somebody.\n\n140\n00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.790\nI have to have somebody's\nemail address to send this to.\n\n141\n00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.143\nNow this is just like if I'm\ndialing somebody's phone number,\n\n142\n00:07:30.143 --> 00:07:32.160\nI gotta have the phone number\nto know where I'm going.\n\n143\n00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.678\nAnd you gotta have the right phone number\nor the right email address, to be able to\n\n144\n00:07:35.678 --> 00:07:39.069\nmake sure that it actually gets to that\nparticular person it should going to.\n\n145\n00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:43.402\nNow, this is Joey's account\nwhich he has been or\n\n146\n00:07:43.402 --> 00:07:47.670\nI have been emailing\nunder his account a lot.\n\n147\n00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.128\nSo this is, it's got a lot of\nstuff in memory we'll say,\n\n148\n00:07:51.128 --> 00:07:55.683\nit's going to remember people that\nI've already addressed messages to.\n\n149\n00:07:55.683 --> 00:07:58.385\nSo when I start typing somebody's name,\n\n150\n00:07:58.385 --> 00:08:02.329\nit's gonna start putting up\na bunch of suggested contacts.\n\n151\n00:08:02.329 --> 00:08:03.096\nIt'll be pulling from my contacts.\n\n152\n00:08:03.096 --> 00:08:05.590\nOr my global address list.\n\n153\n00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.666\nSo those are some things that\nmight happen to you as well,\n\n154\n00:08:08.666 --> 00:08:12.040\neven thought this is the first\ntime I have used Outlook.\n\n155\n00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.180\nBut you could be connected\nto your companies network,\n\n156\n00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.660\nand it might start pulling up a bunch of\nstuff, so don't be alarmed in that or\n\n157\n00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.050\ndon't be alarmed that it doesn't happen.\n\n158\n00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:24.210\nSo I am gonna start typing in the letter\nJ to show you that I was going to address\n\n159\n00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.470\nthis to Justin Timberlake, and\nyou can see it pulled up all these people.\n\n160\n00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:32.780\nLike I just said, I do have things in my\ncontacts, I do have a global address list,\n\n161\n00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:38.522\nand it is looking and finding things\nthat it might give me some suggestions.\n\n162\n00:08:38.522 --> 00:08:42.185\nIf it is somebody that, yes,\nthat's exactly who I want.\n\n163\n00:08:42.185 --> 00:08:47.015\nIf you just click that in the drop-down,\nit automatically populates for you.\n\n164\n00:08:47.015 --> 00:08:50.115\nThat's fantastic, great, I don't have to\ntype it cuz this email address is really,\n\n165\n00:08:50.115 --> 00:08:50.840\nreally long.\n\n166\n00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.717\n[LAUGH] So that's always good to do, but\n\n167\n00:08:53.717 --> 00:08:56.547\nmaybe I don't wanna address\nthis to Justin, you see how\n\n168\n00:08:56.547 --> 00:08:59.767\nevery time you address something to\nsomebody it outs it a little bubble.\n\n169\n00:08:59.767 --> 00:09:03.437\nNow it's choosing Justin Timberlake and\nhis picture,\n\n170\n00:09:03.437 --> 00:09:07.217\nbecause he's part of our global address\nlist, which I'll explain in just a second,\n\n171\n00:09:08.327 --> 00:09:12.227\nif it wasn't part of my global addresses\nor somebody that I did not have\n\n172\n00:09:12.227 --> 00:09:15.477\nin my contacts already, it might just\nhave the person's email address.\n\n173\n00:09:15.477 --> 00:09:18.860\nIt might be jsutin@itpro.tv cuz maybe\n\n174\n00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.415\nthat's the first time I've ever\nemailed Justin, that Justin.\n\n175\n00:09:22.415 --> 00:09:23.745\n[LAUGH] Not that Justin.\n\n176\n00:09:23.745 --> 00:09:25.970\n[LAUGH] From this account.\n\n177\n00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:30.980\nSo it will show that way but it does\nput it in this little bubble like thing\n\n178\n00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.540\nin each recipient within\neach of your field.\n\n179\n00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.540\nAnd that's what the two field is saying,\nwho do I want it from.\n\n180\n00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.740\nThe little x will be,\nI don't want that there so\n\n181\n00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.330\nI can say, nope let's go ahead and\nget rid of that.\n\n182\n00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.080\nYou could also take your\ndelete keys sometimes and\n\n183\n00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.610\nbackspace over that, but sometimes it\ndoesn't work, it's browser specific and\n\n184\n00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:55.560\nsome browsers won't let you do that within\nthe to field, because some of the browsers\n\n185\n00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.280\nyour backspace or your delete\nkey means a keyboard shortcut to\n\n186\n00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.910\ngo backwards in your browsing your\nhistory so just keep that in mind.\n\n187\n00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.070\nWhat is a Global Address List?\n\n188\n00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:13.170\nIn a nutshell,\nit is your company's main address book\n\n189\n00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.990\nof everybody within your organization,\nif you're in a networked environment.\n\n190\n00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:19.870\nIf you're not in a networked environment,\n\n191\n00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.910\nyou might not ever see\na Global Address List.\n\n192\n00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:27.650\nSo, it's one of those,\nhey it depends on where you're at.\n\n193\n00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.580\nIn a company and\nhow your network or lack thereof,\n\n194\n00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.820\nif you wanna say, network is set up.\n\n195\n00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.880\nAnd your contacts are things you have\nwithin your Outlook account, and\n\n196\n00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.840\nthat way it's like you're saving people\nin your own personal address list.\n\n197\n00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.810\nBut that's where if you click this\ntwo button It'll bring you to where\n\n198\n00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:54.060\nyou could choose from those\ncontacts you have in your\n\n199\n00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:59.410\nparticular outlook, or that global\naddress list that is for a company.\n\n200\n00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:02.400\n&gt;&gt; Now, I just have a quick question,\nmaybe I missed it,\n\n201\n00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.400\nI just wanna make sure I understand it.\n\n202\n00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.370\nWhat about, so global address list,\nthat's populated from some kind of.\n\n203\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.000\nCorporate infrastructure or\nbusiness infrastructure.\n\n204\n00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.660\nAnd then I have my contacts\nwhich will also be populated.\n\n205\n00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.090\nBut what if they're not in my contacts,\nbut I've emailed them at least one time?\n\n206\n00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.870\nWill that also pre-populate, or\nis that something that I have to set up?\n\n207\n00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.710\n&gt;&gt; It will start remembering.\n\n208\n00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:28.750\nIt's that once you do it once,\nthe next time you come back and\n\n209\n00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.610\naddress it it will come up in that list.\n\n210\n00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:35.130\nSo, yes, there is situations where it\nwon't be in either of those places.\n\n211\n00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:40.220\nBut you've used it enough times, where it\njust remembers the most frequently used,\n\n212\n00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.980\nor your most recent addresses\nthat you've typed in.\n\n213\n00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:49.680\nSo, good clarification there, cuz it\nsometimes won't be in either one of them.\n\n214\n00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.530\nSo, yeah, clicking on that 2 field,\nyou can see it's going to bring up\n\n215\n00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:58.030\nplaces that you can find your contacts,\nor in your global address list.\n\n216\n00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.390\nYou see this little button over here\nto where it's like expanding and\n\n217\n00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:05.840\ncontracting, this is where\nyou're seeing your context.\n\n218\n00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.010\nAnd then also some things in your\ndirectories, okay, and that might be to\n\n219\n00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:14.490\nwhere you see things differently depending\non how your network is set up, and\n\n220\n00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:19.610\nso it's great if you have this stuff\nalready populated in your Outlook account.\n\n221\n00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:25.390\nNow I don't wanna use this address book in\nthe two button when I was in the email.\n\n222\n00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:29.630\nSo it's like okay, well how do I get out\nof it, cancel is always a good button.\n\n223\n00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:36.350\nSee I'm still back in my message window\nthat I'm using, It's just type it in.\n\n224\n00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:40.830\nOr use that To button to be\nable to populate our to field.\n\n225\n00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:44.070\nI'll be like, I am going to, and\nnotice I even just clicked it and\n\n226\n00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:51.760\nI didn't even type anything, and see,\nyou're seeing I had put in vonne@opdc.\n\n227\n00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.629\nThat's not in my contacts, but\nI was using that to email myself.\n\n228\n00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.605\nSo all these episodes I'm\njust emailing myself,\n\n229\n00:12:59.605 --> 00:13:01.146\nbecause I'm all sorts of people here.\n\n230\n00:13:01.146 --> 00:13:05.220\n&gt;&gt; But they say that you should talk to\nyourself to really understand something.\n\n231\n00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.685\nAnd well we're seeing it in action.\n\n232\n00:13:06.685 --> 00:13:08.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But also you're\n\n233\n00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.940\ntelling us a little bit about yourselves,\nand Justin Timberlake's number one.\n\n234\n00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.265\nI have been mistaken for\nhim a time or two.\n\n235\n00:13:13.265 --> 00:13:15.102\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Justin it is crazy.\n\n236\n00:13:15.102 --> 00:13:18.900\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH] Yes you haven't\nhosted with me that much,\n\n237\n00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:22.010\nso you don't know\nthe inner workings of this.\n\n238\n00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.970\nStay around you'll see where we go.\n\n239\n00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.020\n&gt;&gt; I can't wait.\n\n240\n00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can't wait.\n\n241\n00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.490\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, so\nthese are the fields in our basic message.\n\n242\n00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.387\nYou have the two,\nyou have the Cc, Cc stands for\n\n243\n00:13:34.387 --> 00:13:39.171\ncarbon copy, we will be explaining that\na little bit more in the next episode,\n\n244\n00:13:39.171 --> 00:13:43.737\na little bit more in-depth this is just\nan overview it's somebody that you\n\n245\n00:13:43.737 --> 00:13:47.459\nwant to be copied in in\nan email,that maybe not directly to.\n\n246\n00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:49.456\nWe'll talk about the Cc again soon, and\n\n247\n00:13:49.456 --> 00:13:52.040\nthen the next one we have\nover here is Add a Subject.\n\n248\n00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.290\nWe need to put a subject or\n\n249\n00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.600\na title for the message that\nwe're going to be sending.\n\n250\n00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:04.200\nSo let's just say, hello friend,\nright, yeah friend, [LAUGH] yay.\n\n251\n00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.250\nI just hit the tab key.\n\n252\n00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.340\nI didn't actually use my mouse,\n\n253\n00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.600\nbecause you can use your tab key as\nyou go through these different fields.\n\n254\n00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.430\nYou can address it, hit the tab,\ngo to the cc tab, type in your subject.\n\n255\n00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.287\nTab get into your message body.\n\n256\n00:14:17.287 --> 00:14:18.790\nAnd so those are some ways you can do it.\n\n257\n00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.140\nAnd there's nothing wrong\nwith using your mouse.\n\n258\n00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.860\nWe'll point out if you're like, well hey,\nyou've gotten all the way down to this box\n\n259\n00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.600\ndown here and you didn't see what\nwas here on the right hand side.\n\n260\n00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.920\nThere is this BCC field,\n\n261\n00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.320\nwhich is blind carbon copy that you\ncould use to go ahead and populate that.\n\n262\n00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.290\nWhat does that mean?\n\n263\n00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.280\nCome on back for part 2!\n\n264\n00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.662\n&gt;&gt; And just as a little teaser, I like\nto call it the blindside carbon copy.\n\n265\n00:14:40.662 --> 00:14:43.134\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's how I think of it.\n\n266\n00:14:43.134 --> 00:14:46.934\n&gt;&gt; Because sometimes you\nmight be blindsided of,\n\n267\n00:14:46.934 --> 00:14:51.020\nlike hey I didn't realize\nthat this is not just me.\n\n268\n00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; Come on, [LAUGH] Awesome.\n\n269\n00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.100\nSo back down into our message.\n\n270\n00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.590\nWhat are we going to say to our friend?\n\n271\n00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:03.110\nWe are just going to say,\nhello exclamation point, how are you?\n\n272\n00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.420\n&gt;&gt; Short and sweet, there you go.\n\n273\n00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.550\nAnd you could see actually\nbehind my head just to point\n\n274\n00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.850\nout that down here on the bottom that\nauto saving that we're talking about,\n\n275\n00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.140\nit says draft saves at 2:08.\n\n276\n00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.270\nIt, you were talking about\nthe incremental save.\n\n277\n00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.410\nIt's pretty In vast increments.\n\n278\n00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:24.520\nSo it goes very, very quickly,\nunlike the three minutes or\n\n279\n00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.600\nthe five minutes as you have\nin our desktop version.\n\n280\n00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.290\nSo just a little point out in\nthe bottom right-hand corner.\n\n281\n00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.030\nAll the rest of the buttons will talk\nabout it in another episode to make things\n\n282\n00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.480\nlook really pretty over there.\n\n283\n00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.840\nWe're gonna say yep,\nI'm done and I'm gonna send.\n\n284\n00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.700\nNow, discard would mean that\nI don't want this anymore.\n\n285\n00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.280\nIt would give you a window that says hey,\ndo you really wanna do this,\n\n286\n00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.260\nyou really wanna delete this?\n\n287\n00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.470\nAnd you would say yes.\n\n288\n00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:50.219\nNow there is a send in the bottom,\nthere is also a send in the top so\n\n289\n00:15:50.219 --> 00:15:53.704\nwhichever way you wanna go,\nwe 're gonna click that send.\n\n290\n00:15:53.704 --> 00:15:58.836\nIt sends, it closes my extra window that I\nhad used when I used to pop that out, and\n\n291\n00:15:58.836 --> 00:16:04.200\nnow it is gone through the Ether, and\nsomebody on the other end will receive it.\n\n292\n00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.862\nHopefully I will address it to the right\nperson I have done that where I typed\n\n293\n00:16:08.862 --> 00:16:10.270\nsomebody's name in.\n\n294\n00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.996\nJust a little wrong, and\nthey emailed me back like,\n\n295\n00:16:13.996 --> 00:16:17.140\nI think you're looking for somebody else.\n\n296\n00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.235\nI'm like, yes, I sure did.\n\n297\n00:16:19.235 --> 00:16:20.970\n[LAUGH] So be careful about that.\n\n298\n00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:26.578\nMake sure you double check your number,\nyour address to the right person.\n\n299\n00:16:26.578 --> 00:16:32.710\nNow since this was sent off,\nit will show up in my sent items folder.\n\n300\n00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.223\nIf I click on the Sent Items,\nit shows me that,\n\n301\n00:16:35.223 --> 00:16:38.843\nI did send an email to Justin Timberlake,\nthat said Hello Friend.\n\n302\n00:16:38.843 --> 00:16:43.982\nHad a little preview of the line, the time\nthat I sent it, so I know that I sent it.\n\n303\n00:16:43.982 --> 00:16:46.440\nCuz I always do that,\nI'm like, did I do that?\n\n304\n00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.660\nDid I actually emailed that person?\n\n305\n00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:52.460\nYou can tell it through your sent items.\n\n306\n00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:58.210\nNow I'm going to go ahead and jump over,\nand be Mr Justin Timberlake over here,\n\n307\n00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.797\nand good,\nmy virtual machine didn't fall asleep yet.\n\n308\n00:17:00.797 --> 00:17:02.270\n[LAUGH] So I have it here,\n\n309\n00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:07.760\nI'm like now, what is it going to be like\nwhen I'm on the receiving end of an email.\n\n310\n00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:13.320\nSo as Justin,\nI now see my message from Joey Fetone.\n\n311\n00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.723\nSingle clicking and double clicking,\n\n312\n00:17:16.723 --> 00:17:21.162\nyou need to be just aware\nenough about what it does.\n\n313\n00:17:21.162 --> 00:17:24.614\nAnd I always tell people, single\nclick first, and if it doesn't work,\n\n314\n00:17:24.614 --> 00:17:26.042\nthen double click it, okay?\n\n315\n00:17:26.042 --> 00:17:30.690\nSo kinda, as a rule of thumb, if I single\nclick this, I have selected this email.\n\n316\n00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.500\nI do have the reading\npane on in his account.\n\n317\n00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.716\nSo it says, hey,\nI'm looking at this email that says,\n\n318\n00:17:37.716 --> 00:17:42.023\nI have received an email from Joey Fatone,\nat this date,\n\n319\n00:17:42.023 --> 00:17:45.821\nit is addressed to me, and\nI have seen this email.\n\n320\n00:17:45.821 --> 00:17:49.133\nIf you double click it,\nnow I'm double clicking right here,\n\n321\n00:17:49.133 --> 00:17:51.310\nI'm going to wait a second.\n\n322\n00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:55.340\nNow I've actually opened it up into\nanother window, just like I demo and\n\n323\n00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.840\nI popped up that message.\n\n324\n00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:01.701\nSo, whichever way you wanna do it,\nthey both will work, they just take you\n\n325\n00:18:01.701 --> 00:18:05.962\nto the slightly different places,\nand just being aware of that.\n\n326\n00:18:05.962 --> 00:18:08.290\nI'm gonna close this.\n\n327\n00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:11.800\nI'm gonna go ahead and just click this\nlittle x right here to close that message.\n\n328\n00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:17.730\nIn that window, coming back, cuz I can\nstill do everything from the reading pane.\n\n329\n00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:21.155\nIf I wanted to reply to this message,\n\n330\n00:18:21.155 --> 00:18:26.236\nthe little button up here on\nthe top right hand corner,\n\n331\n00:18:26.236 --> 00:18:33.542\nI think this is very interesting that,\nthe default first option is reply all.\n\n332\n00:18:33.542 --> 00:18:38.195\nI think that's, I now maybe know why\nI've been on an email before back at\n\n333\n00:18:38.195 --> 00:18:43.309\nthe university where it's addressed to\neverybody, and there would be at least\n\n334\n00:18:43.309 --> 00:18:48.367\nsix or seven people that would always\nclick the reply all, every single time.\n\n335\n00:18:48.367 --> 00:18:51.976\nAnd I bet they are just like, that's just\na default button, I'm gonna click it, and\n\n336\n00:18:51.976 --> 00:18:53.600\nit goes to everywhere.\n\n337\n00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.500\nNow, I'm saying there's a default on this,\nthat means, we could probably change it.\n\n338\n00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:03.084\nYou can, I personally I have changed this\non my Outlook on the web, my account.\n\n339\n00:19:03.084 --> 00:19:07.612\nI've made that to where reply all is not\nmy first button because sometimes we just\n\n340\n00:19:07.612 --> 00:19:08.886\ngo and click it and go.\n\n341\n00:19:08.886 --> 00:19:10.530\nI'll show you where to change that.\n\n342\n00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.810\nThe dropdown next to it, this is\nwhere you get all sorts of options.\n\n343\n00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:16.160\nThere's a couple, actually,\nmore options behind my head as well,\n\n344\n00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.310\njust to show the full list of everything.\n\n345\n00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:24.690\nYou could see that I've got Reply, Reply\nall, Forward, I have some Mark as junk,\n\n346\n00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:28.090\nand I have some other things like\nprinting, viewing the message details.\n\n347\n00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:30.770\nSo there's a lot of different\nthings that it's giving you as\n\n348\n00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:35.540\nactions on what you could do with\nthe email that you have received.\n\n349\n00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.680\nRight now, I really just wanna\nreply back to the person.\n\n350\n00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.220\nI just want to do a simple one.\n\n351\n00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.940\nSo clicking the dropdown\non the action button,\n\n352\n00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:47.684\nclicking Reply and\nnow I am answering the email from Justin,\n\n353\n00:19:47.684 --> 00:19:51.511\ncuz remember, wait no,\nI'm Justin right now.\n\n354\n00:19:51.511 --> 00:19:56.251\nI'm [LAUGH] answering Joey, and\nI'm saying, yes, I'd like to go ahead and\n\n355\n00:19:56.251 --> 00:19:58.439\nsay, I'm great.\n\n356\n00:19:58.439 --> 00:19:58.969\nThank you.\n\n357\n00:19:58.969 --> 00:20:00.166\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And Vonne,\n\n358\n00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:03.265\nI'm sorry that you're having\na little bit of an identity crisis.\n\n359\n00:20:03.265 --> 00:20:04.318\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, but\n\n360\n00:20:04.318 --> 00:20:07.475\njust to further reiterate why\nthat's a reply all there.\n\n361\n00:20:07.475 --> 00:20:10.612\nWhen we talked about conversations\nversus the messages, all right,\n\n362\n00:20:10.612 --> 00:20:14.494\nthose conversations are grouped, and if\nit's among multiple people, and everybody\n\n363\n00:20:14.494 --> 00:20:18.630\nneeds to stay in the loop, well that's\nkind of when you're gonna wanna reply all.\n\n364\n00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:22.870\nBut do keep in mind that, if you wanna\nreply to the person who send it to you and\n\n365\n00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:27.063\nnot to everybody else that they send\nit to, don't just click that button.\n\n366\n00:20:27.063 --> 00:20:31.754\nBut if it's a conversation that you're\nhaving remotely at kind of at scale,\n\n367\n00:20:31.754 --> 00:20:34.580\nreply all, and\nthen that'll just make sure.\n\n368\n00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.926\nIt's kind of almost like a bulletin board-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n369\n00:20:36.926 --> 00:20:39.300\n&gt;&gt; Of sorts, so keep that in mind.\n\n370\n00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:43.194\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, and that's it's\nalways that stop, think, where am I at,\n\n371\n00:20:43.194 --> 00:20:44.984\nwhat I am doing, what do I wanna say?\n\n372\n00:20:44.984 --> 00:20:45.831\nWhat button do I need to click?\n\n373\n00:20:45.831 --> 00:20:49.546\nSo I always tell people to like stop,\nbreathe, and then keep going.\n\n374\n00:20:49.546 --> 00:20:54.880\nAnd I have to remind myself that all\nthe time is like, I just did it.\n\n375\n00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.540\nWell, we all do it, so that's good.\n\n376\n00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:02.930\nAs Justin,\nI'm replying to my friend, Joey.\n\n377\n00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:07.396\nI'll click the Send button all right\nhere within the reading pane, and\n\n378\n00:21:07.396 --> 00:21:10.679\nnow I have done a very simple\nreply as Justin to Joey.\n\n379\n00:21:10.679 --> 00:21:14.590\nLet's jump back over into Joey's mailbox.\n\n380\n00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.573\nAnd you can see that, I almost starting\ndoing like, it hasn't come in yet.\n\n381\n00:21:19.573 --> 00:21:21.050\nDo you know why I haven't seen it?\n\n382\n00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:23.240\nWhy can't I see that there, Justin?\n\n383\n00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:28.423\n&gt;&gt; You're in the Sent Items instead of\nthe Inbox which I'm not gonna say I have,\n\n384\n00:21:28.423 --> 00:21:30.349\nbut I have done that before.\n\n385\n00:21:30.349 --> 00:21:31.493\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So gotta be careful,\n\n386\n00:21:31.493 --> 00:21:32.840\ngotta know who you are, right?\n\n387\n00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You can't make brownies,\n\n388\n00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:35.460\nif you're in your bedroom.\n\n389\n00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.184\nSo that's important.\n\n390\n00:21:36.184 --> 00:21:39.589\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, I think we've said\nit a couple times, and hopefully,\n\n391\n00:21:39.589 --> 00:21:43.300\nwe've drilled it into your head enough,\nbecause I have to do the same thing.\n\n392\n00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.190\nHere we go.\n\n393\n00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:46.050\nThere's Justin's message.\n\n394\n00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.580\nIt is in conversation.\n\n395\n00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:53.220\nI have everything grouped into showing us\nconversations, not individual messages.\n\n396\n00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:57.500\nSo I can click the little triangle down\nhere, just to see that, okay, there we go.\n\n397\n00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:02.030\nI sent it, Justin is replying, and I could\nclick that, or I can just click that, or\n\n398\n00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.410\nI can just click this one right here.\n\n399\n00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:04.580\nSo it doesn't matter which one,\n\n400\n00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:09.700\nbecause I am the one receiving it,\nand now I have the replies, great.\n\n401\n00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:13.150\nAnd I could go ahead as Joey,\nand reply back and forth.\n\n402\n00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:16.290\nI do want to point out something, and we\ndon't have a really long thread right now.\n\n403\n00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.860\nAnd actually, let me go back to another\nemail that has a little bit longer thread.\n\n404\n00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:24.930\nI'm gonna close this right here at\nthe top, and I have one from here.\n\n405\n00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:30.551\nThis is one I went back and\nforth with myself for demonstrations.\n\n406\n00:22:30.551 --> 00:22:33.982\nSo this was from Justin to Joey,\nand then Justin replied back.\n\n407\n00:22:33.982 --> 00:22:37.070\nYou see these little dots right here?\n\n408\n00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:41.964\nCuz everything is, all right, I click on\nthis part, this is what Justin sent to me.\n\n409\n00:22:41.964 --> 00:22:43.740\nI'm Joey, remember?\n\n410\n00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:47.698\nPerfect, it says hello Joey, this is\nwhat I, oops, I clicked the wrong part.\n\n411\n00:22:47.698 --> 00:22:51.196\nI went ahead and clicked the message and\nnow this is what I said, and\n\n412\n00:22:51.196 --> 00:22:52.420\nhere it is back.\n\n413\n00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.033\nIt can get even for me,\nit gets confusing sometimes like,\n\n414\n00:22:56.033 --> 00:23:00.632\nwhere I'm I clicking, what I'm I doing,\nlet me see the message thread.\n\n415\n00:23:00.632 --> 00:23:04.097\nBut these little dots right here,\nand if you've been in Gmail,\n\n416\n00:23:04.097 --> 00:23:07.320\nif you're a Gmail person then,\nyou see these in Gmail too.\n\n417\n00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:12.227\nIts showing a message history, if I\nclick on it, here it is almost in the,\n\n418\n00:23:12.227 --> 00:23:14.854\nI almost wanna say in the classic view.\n\n419\n00:23:14.854 --> 00:23:19.548\nIn the classic view of where you're\nseeing it all kind of in one string.\n\n420\n00:23:19.548 --> 00:23:22.370\nBut then, it's down here again too, so\n\n421\n00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:28.100\njust be a little careful of not getting\nyourself too confused as what's going on.\n\n422\n00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:32.160\nBut I do like, if I don't wanna have to\nclick on each one of those little pieces,\n\n423\n00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.200\nclicking the dots will show it all\nlike inline, if you wanna say.\n\n424\n00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.239\nSo that's what that button does if you\nwanted to see it in a different way.\n\n425\n00:23:40.239 --> 00:23:45.492\nBut there was something that happened\nthere that I did by mistake.\n\n426\n00:23:45.492 --> 00:23:50.086\nIf I wanted to get to it is that,\nif you click on the person's name,\n\n427\n00:23:50.086 --> 00:23:55.600\nlike your sender, who it's from, you can\nget into the details of that person.\n\n428\n00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.278\nIt comes over kind of like\nthe people pane in the desktop view.\n\n429\n00:23:58.278 --> 00:24:02.854\nAnd there's actually a little bit more\nbehind my head as well, you could see that\n\n430\n00:24:02.854 --> 00:24:07.027\nI see that this is Justin Timberlake And\nbecause he's part of my address,\n\n431\n00:24:07.027 --> 00:24:11.500\nI can see things like his phone number and\nI can see the contact details.\n\n432\n00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:15.121\nI can see that he is also part of\na group that we're in together.\n\n433\n00:24:15.121 --> 00:24:19.956\nAnd then I can also see related\nitems to Justin Timberlake.\n\n434\n00:24:19.956 --> 00:24:22.813\nOther emails that he has sent me.\n\n435\n00:24:22.813 --> 00:24:27.730\nOther maybe files that he has\nattached that were sent to me.\n\n436\n00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.776\nOther events that we have\non the calendar together.\n\n437\n00:24:30.776 --> 00:24:33.270\nSo it's like a more button.\n\n438\n00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:37.040\nIt's the details that people\npane on that particular person,\n\n439\n00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.700\nand you can find all of the information\nthat you might need to have.\n\n440\n00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.340\nAnd so\nthat's clicking on the person's name.\n\n441\n00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:49.030\nI'm going to scroll up to the top,\nclose this pane that comes up, and that is\n\n442\n00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:54.590\nthe people pane and you could always go\nto add to contacts from there as well.\n\n443\n00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.490\nWell, where are we going now?\n\n444\n00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.270\nWe need to talk about attachments for\na minute.\n\n445\n00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:04.530\nBecause I can type in some messages and\nmake my message in the email body but\n\n446\n00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.570\nwhat if I needed to send him a report or\n\n447\n00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:11.390\nI wanted to send him a picture of\nmy cat or something to that effect.\n\n448\n00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.224\nI need to attach a file.\n\n449\n00:25:13.224 --> 00:25:15.697\nLet's go back over to here.\n\n450\n00:25:15.697 --> 00:25:16.831\nLet's go to a new message.\n\n451\n00:25:16.831 --> 00:25:20.685\nWe'll start a new one and we will\naddress this to Justin Timberlake and\n\n452\n00:25:20.685 --> 00:25:22.070\nwe will say attachment.\n\n453\n00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:26.671\nAnd like a check it out.\n\n454\n00:25:26.671 --> 00:25:28.100\nWhat am I going to attach?\n\n455\n00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:33.270\nThere's two places that I can\nattach a file, up at the top or\n\n456\n00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.860\ndown at the bottom,\nthe little piece of paper note.\n\n457\n00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:37.750\nPaper note?\n\n458\n00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:38.646\n&gt;&gt; Paperclip.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n459\n00:25:38.646 --> 00:25:40.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was those things that we\n\n460\n00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:43.445\nused before the digital age to actually\nbind a bunch of stuff together.\n\n461\n00:25:43.445 --> 00:25:45.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like attach other things together.\n\n462\n00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:46.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; To give them\n\n463\n00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:50.521\nI don't know if I use a paperclip\nother than to get CDs out of drawers.\n\n464\n00:25:50.521 --> 00:25:52.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And things like that.\n\n465\n00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.060\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nYeah to get the sim card out of things or\n\n466\n00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.210\nto make those little chains.\n\n467\n00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:57.690\nThat's what I always used to do especially\nif there were different colors.\n\n468\n00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.060\nSo I'm going to attach a file.\n\n469\n00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.540\nI'll go to the top button.\n\n470\n00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.290\nWhen I click the attach button.\n\n471\n00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:08.660\nThis works a little differently than\nour desktop version in the sense that\n\n472\n00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.960\nit puts us in this window.\n\n473\n00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.830\nAnd then it takes us to certain places\non our computer or into our One Drive.\n\n474\n00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:20.000\nNow that's not too different than\nan attachment in the desktop version.\n\n475\n00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.500\nLike okay so what's really different?\n\n476\n00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.210\nI'll show you when I actually\ngo to attach a file.\n\n477\n00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:26.320\nNow, if I do want to attach a file for\n\n478\n00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.440\nmy OneDrive account that's associated\nwith this, that's wonderful.\n\n479\n00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.870\nIf it is a picture that is on my computer,\nI can click on my computer and notice that\n\n480\n00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:40.690\nit brings up the old Windows, what I call\nit, or the normal Windows dialog box.\n\n481\n00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:43.880\nAnd then I can choose a picture.\n\n482\n00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.640\nDoesn't matter if you're doing OneDrive or\na computer.\n\n483\n00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.180\nSo, I'm just going to click this one for\nnow and click open.\n\n484\n00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.120\nIt's this part that happens.\n\n485\n00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:58.390\nOnce you select a file,\nhow do you want to attach this file to it?\n\n486\n00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.940\nUploading it attaches a OneDrive file.\n\n487\n00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:08.220\nIt's a shared document to where it lives\nin your computer, not your computer,\n\n488\n00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.230\nyour Cloud computer, your OneDrive.\n\n489\n00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:16.040\nThe person gets a link to be\nable to share, a shared link,\n\n490\n00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:21.510\nto that document, and they can click\nit and see it up in the Cloud.\n\n491\n00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:25.480\nAnd that means that since it's\nin a central storage location,\n\n492\n00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.910\nif you make changes to that file,\nthey still have that link.\n\n493\n00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:32.072\nThey'll be able to see\nthose changes in real time.\n\n494\n00:27:32.072 --> 00:27:38.050\nIt's like sharing a document or\nsharing files in any place, really.\n\n495\n00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:41.910\nIt's just that they give you\nthis option automatically\n\n496\n00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.200\nas an option when you have\nit in Outlook for Web.\n\n497\n00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:48.420\nIn this case, I don't really want that,\n\n498\n00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:53.140\nI just want to give them\na copy of the picture.\n\n499\n00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:57.564\nSo, attaching as copy means\nthey're getting the file.\n\n500\n00:27:57.564 --> 00:28:01.490\nIt's not a link to a shared file,\nthat would be option number one.\n\n501\n00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:06.336\nSo that's the biggest difference\nin attaching a file to an email in\n\n502\n00:28:06.336 --> 00:28:08.140\nOutlook for Web.\n\n503\n00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.650\nNow, once you have it attached,\nyou can see it shows up right here.\n\n504\n00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:15.865\nCouple options before we leave this\nepisode, I can see looking at me there,\n\n505\n00:28:15.865 --> 00:28:17.965\nJess, like hey, gotta wrap this up.\n\n506\n00:28:17.965 --> 00:28:22.105\nSo you can close this or when I say\nclose that means removing it like oops I\n\n507\n00:28:22.105 --> 00:28:23.745\ndidn't want to attach that file.\n\n508\n00:28:23.745 --> 00:28:27.635\nThere's also a drop down next to it\nto where you could preview this,\n\n509\n00:28:27.635 --> 00:28:29.425\nI can see what it looks like.\n\n510\n00:28:29.425 --> 00:28:32.545\nI could upload to OneDrive, hmm well\nthat's kind of an interesting thing.\n\n511\n00:28:32.545 --> 00:28:36.545\nSo if I wanted to have this here but\nit's like but it's my file but\n\n512\n00:28:36.545 --> 00:28:38.050\nI really want it on my computer.\n\n513\n00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:40.930\nThink about it when you receive\nattachments you're going to have\n\n514\n00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:45.390\nsome of these same options, so it's pretty\ncool that it gives you, it's all seamless.\n\n515\n00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:50.100\nBut in this case since it's already mine,\nI don't really need to do that.\n\n516\n00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.570\nBut the other one I wanted to point out\nwas move image to the message body.\n\n517\n00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:55.740\nInstead of saving it as an attachment,\n\n518\n00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:59.330\nor sending it as an attachment,\nyou put it in line with the message.\n\n519\n00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.940\nIt's personal preference but\n\n520\n00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:06.500\nif it's in the message it's\nmore of a formatting thing.\n\n521\n00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.930\nIf it's in an attachment,\nI know that that's to me.\n\n522\n00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:11.880\nI want to give you this file.\n\n523\n00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:16.370\nSo I'd probably stick\nwith keeping it as is but\n\n524\n00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:21.290\nI wanted to at least explore some of\nthose options with you before we go.\n\n525\n00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:27.320\nLet me go ahead and send this off to\nJustin that he gets a picture of Joey and\n\n526\n00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.820\nthat is just some of the basic things\nyou can do with composing an email.\n\n527\n00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.320\nAddressing it to somebody.\n\n528\n00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:37.580\nReceiving the emails, responding to it and\nhow to add an attachment.\n\n529\n00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:41.190\n&gt;&gt; Well Von it definitely seems really\neasy when you list them off like that but\n\n530\n00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:44.425\nit's actually a lot more complicated\nwhen you actually dive in.\n\n531\n00:29:44.425 --> 00:29:48.170\nNow I know we have a lot more to do\nwith composing and managing emails so\n\n532\n00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:50.350\nwe're gonna have to come\nback with some more parts.\n\n533\n00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:54.280\nSo continue with us, but we're gonna\ngo ahead and sign off for OFFICEPRO.TV.\n\n534\n00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.830\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n535\n00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:56.640\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n536\n00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:00.380\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n537\n00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.240\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:10.473\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:10.473 --> 00:00:13.340\nAnd well you're back,\nI'm here, Vonne's here.\n\n5\n00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.090\nAnd we're coming with\nmore Outlook on the Web.\n\n6\n00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.078\nAnd specifically, well, we're continuing\non with learning how to send, receive, and\n\n7\n00:00:20.078 --> 00:00:20.975\nmanage our emails.\n\n8\n00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:23.748\nAnd well Vonne is with\nus as I've already said.\n\n9\n00:00:23.748 --> 00:00:25.066\nHow are you doing do today Vonne?\n\n10\n00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.012\n&gt;&gt; I'm good.\n\n11\n00:00:26.012 --> 00:00:27.412\nBack for part two.\n\n12\n00:00:27.412 --> 00:00:27.989\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n13\n00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:29.729\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Back, right.\n\n14\n00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:30.392\nLets go.\n\n15\n00:00:30.392 --> 00:00:36.100\n[LAUGH] So in part one we talked about\naddressing an email to a single recipient.\n\n16\n00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.850\nAnd now we're gonna be dealing\nwith multiple recipients.\n\n17\n00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.021\nAnd we're gonna talk about that wonderful\nBCC field, and we're gonna talk\n\n18\n00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:47.664\nabout being blindsided and talk about the\nCC game, and explore that drafts folder.\n\n19\n00:00:47.664 --> 00:00:52.038\nWhy don't we just go ahead and\njump right in to Joey's account, and\n\n20\n00:00:52.038 --> 00:00:55.430\nwe're on our Inbox and we're ready to go.\n\n21\n00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.810\nSo there's a lot of times where you need\nto address emails to multiple people.\n\n22\n00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.029\nLike we're in a group, and let me clarify,\n\n23\n00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:08.608\ndifferent than a group here in Outlook\nwhere a just general group of people.\n\n24\n00:01:08.608 --> 00:01:13.659\nAnd so I need to address say hey,\nwe're gonna go to lunch, or we need\n\n25\n00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.555\nto go ahead get organized to get that\nboss's Christmas present taken care of.\n\n26\n00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:25.183\nSo give me some money, so I can go buy\nsomething or those types of things.\n\n27\n00:01:25.183 --> 00:01:30.325\nWhy don't we start a new message and\nlook at those options that we have.\n\n28\n00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:35.121\nSo new message, here's our to field,\nand the to field is the people we\n\n29\n00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:40.020\nwant to address an email to, wow,\nfeeling very circular right there.\n\n30\n00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.761\nBut this is the direct person\nthat we're talking to.\n\n31\n00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:48.130\nThe cc,\nnow the cc field is carbon copy, and\n\n32\n00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.880\nthis is the place where I\ntalk about the cc game.\n\n33\n00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.310\nNow let me tell you a little\nwhat I mean by that, and\n\n34\n00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.540\nJustin you might have been privy to this\nwonderful game from time to time maybe.\n\n35\n00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.150\nSo I will see that it is addressed to me,\n\n36\n00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.640\nbut there are six people\ncarbon copied on it.\n\n37\n00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.934\nAnd they're my boss, my boss's boss,\nmy boss's boss's boss.\n\n38\n00:02:10.934 --> 00:02:12.319\nAnd it's like, okay so are you,\n\n39\n00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.559\nI think he's trying to tell\nme something right here.\n\n40\n00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:19.659\n[LAUGH] And then hey, and\nyou're also seeing this,\n\n41\n00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:25.840\neverybody is on this to let them\nknow that I'm talking to you.\n\n42\n00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.730\nAnd I think it could be\nvery effective sometimes.\n\n43\n00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.378\nThere's times where I've used it in\nreverse I guess you could say, where I'm\n\n44\n00:02:35.378 --> 00:02:39.969\nsending an emailing to somebody and\nI want them to know that, hey guess what?\n\n45\n00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:44.177\nThe boss is in on this, so it's out there.\n\n46\n00:02:44.177 --> 00:02:45.880\nIt's like this is public record.\n\n47\n00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.310\nEverybody is all knowing that\nwe're all talking to each other,\n\n48\n00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.210\nand this is the communication.\n\n49\n00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.510\nAnd so you're not addressing\nthem directly, but indirectly.\n\n50\n00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.669\nAnd it can be effective or\nsometimes ineffective.\n\n51\n00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:04.918\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n52\n00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:07.899\nif you're directly addressing\neverybody in a group,\n\n53\n00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:12.092\nlike you're speaking to a group,\nyou should put everybody in the to field.\n\n54\n00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:15.300\nBut you're talk about the cc game,\n\n55\n00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.640\nhowever sometimes I think of it\nas the passive aggressive button.\n\n56\n00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.808\nIt's the, or the eavesdrop button.\n\n57\n00:03:20.808 --> 00:03:24.951\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're like giving a direct line\n\n58\n00:03:24.951 --> 00:03:27.110\nthe two cups and a string.\n\n59\n00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.630\nYou're like here,\nhold this I'm gonna talk to them.\n\n60\n00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.800\nHold this by my side.\n\n61\n00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.360\nSo be aware that the CC, those people\nare privy to the conversation.\n\n62\n00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.170\nAnd it's kinda weird, because how\nis that different than To and CC?\n\n63\n00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.120\nCC, you're a bystander.\n\n64\n00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.880\nYou're just listening in,\nunless things get out of hand, right?\n\n65\n00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.155\nHopefully that never happens\nin an email or in general.\n\n66\n00:03:48.155 --> 00:03:51.597\nTo though, you're broadcasting the message\nand you're looking for input for\n\n67\n00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:52.685\nanybody in the To field.\n\n68\n00:03:52.685 --> 00:03:55.790\nIt's a little semantic difference,\nbut it's important.\n\n69\n00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.150\nEspecially in email etiquette in the sort.\n\n70\n00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI totally hear what you're saying.\n\n71\n00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.930\nI love the eavesdropping button,\nI think that's a great way of putting it.\n\n72\n00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.935\nAnd yeah, there's times when I'm CC'd and\nI never respond.\n\n73\n00:04:06.935 --> 00:04:09.613\nIn the sense that I feel\nlike I know my role, but\n\n74\n00:04:09.613 --> 00:04:14.840\nthen there's other times where I'll jump\nin maybe throw my two cents into the ring.\n\n75\n00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.700\nAnd I love the game where there's\npeople CC'd on it and then you reply or\n\n76\n00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.040\nsomebody replies back to just you.\n\n77\n00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.195\nAnd then you reply back to them, but\nthen put the people back in the CC.\n\n78\n00:04:25.195 --> 00:04:29.307\nSo it's like, hey, I know that you're\ntrying to talk to just me, but\n\n79\n00:04:29.307 --> 00:04:32.027\nthere are sometimes where\nI have to go ahead and\n\n80\n00:04:32.027 --> 00:04:34.780\nbring these people back\nin the conversation.\n\n81\n00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.021\nSo this might be a little,\nI wouldn't say digressing,\n\n82\n00:04:39.021 --> 00:04:44.617\nbecause it is just the name of the game\nwhen we're talking about emails and\n\n83\n00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:48.355\nlooking at who is in\nthese specific fields.\n\n84\n00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:53.420\nAnd how to act accordingly,\nand what to do with that.\n\n85\n00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.660\nSo let's actually start addressing\nmultiple people within this message.\n\n86\n00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.820\nI'm going to use my suggestion, so I don't\nhave to type my email in all the way.\n\n87\n00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.590\nSo I'm going to address\nthis to Justin Timberlake.\n\n88\n00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.970\nAnd this is where I'm directly going\nto address Justin, let's say Lance and\n\n89\n00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.520\nChris, because those are the three\npeople that are on the committee for\n\n90\n00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.640\nthe Christmas party planning.\n\n91\n00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.080\nJust making this up top of my head.\n\n92\n00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.147\nSo let's go ahead and\nstart typing in Lance.\n\n93\n00:05:21.147 --> 00:05:28.110\nQuick point here, and\nI've used this in my Outlook 2016 series.\n\n94\n00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.910\nI typed Lance's email in wrong on\npurpose to show what would happen for\n\n95\n00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.590\nundeliverable messages.\n\n96\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.018\nTake notice that it's remembering\nthe lance@officeprodemocode.com.\n\n97\n00:05:41.018 --> 00:05:42.620\nThat's not right.\n\n98\n00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.820\nThere's no typos in there, it's just that\nI've missed an entire part of the address.\n\n99\n00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.150\nIt's Officeprodemoco.onmicrosoft.com.\n\n100\n00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.117\nSo it remembers your wrongs ones too.\n\n101\n00:05:55.117 --> 00:06:02.790\n[LAUGH] So make sure you watch to get\nthe ones that you want in there correctly.\n\n102\n00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.850\nI'm going to check on Lance, so\nthese are my multiple people and\n\n103\n00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.610\nI'll type in Chris as well.\n\n104\n00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.020\nThose are the three people\nthat I want to address it to.\n\n105\n00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.050\nEverybody gets their own little bubble,\nso I could remove one or\n\n106\n00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.310\nthe other if I needed to as necessary.\n\n107\n00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.270\nAnd then I could go ahead and\n\n108\n00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.330\npopulate the CC field if I wanted\nsomebody carbon copied on this.\n\n109\n00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.300\nMaybe say, I have an assistant\nthat needs to just be aware\n\n110\n00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.180\nof the conversations that Justin,\nLance and Chris and\n\n111\n00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.610\nI are all having together, so that person\ncan make notes or so on and so forth.\n\n112\n00:06:41.948 --> 00:06:44.699\nMaybe I realize like,\nwait we had that conversation\n\n113\n00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.220\nin person that Chris didn't really\nwanna be part of the committee,\n\n114\n00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.530\ncuz he wasn't sure he was\nbe able to commit to it.\n\n115\n00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.960\nBut I want him to stay in the loop, so\n\n116\n00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.380\nmaybe I will throw him in the CC,\ncuz I already have him in the To field.\n\n117\n00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.894\nThe cool thing is,\nis that you can just drag and\n\n118\n00:07:00.894 --> 00:07:04.460\ndrop the people around to\nthe places you want them to go.\n\n119\n00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.590\nI can just take it and\nit turns into like a little finger.\n\n120\n00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.530\nI can take this and\njust drag it down into the CC field.\n\n121\n00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:12.554\nAnd then, it moves on down there.\n\n122\n00:07:12.554 --> 00:07:15.140\nSo that way I don't have to delete and\ntype it over,\n\n123\n00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.138\nI can just start moving people around.\n\n124\n00:07:17.138 --> 00:07:19.714\nSo I really like the drag and\n\n125\n00:07:19.714 --> 00:07:26.330\ndrop game that you can play\nwithin your messages in Outlook.\n\n126\n00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.630\nAnd we could go ahead and\nput in a subject, we'll say Christmas,\n\n127\n00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.415\nI can't believe I'm talking about\nChristmas already, it's only June.\n\n128\n00:07:33.415 --> 00:07:38.395\n[LAUGH] Wow, and I can't even spell\nChristmas, Christmas planning and\n\n129\n00:07:38.395 --> 00:07:40.390\nI'll say that let's meet.\n\n130\n00:07:41.638 --> 00:07:46.440\nJust to, now have you watch me type\nwords in incorrectly all the time, and\n\n131\n00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.710\nthis is a common thing that I do.\n\n132\n00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.595\nI forget to capitalize, because after\nall of these years of teaching Word and\n\n133\n00:07:51.595 --> 00:07:54.524\nusing Word as a processor,\nlike the actual application,\n\n134\n00:07:54.524 --> 00:07:58.206\nwhere it automatically capitalizes\nyour first word of your sentences.\n\n135\n00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:00.745\nYeah, it's a bad habit to get into and\nI keep forgetting.\n\n136\n00:08:00.745 --> 00:08:02.654\n[LAUGH] Justin's over\nhere shaking your head.\n\n137\n00:08:02.654 --> 00:08:04.137\nYou know what I'm talking about,\ndon't you?\n\n138\n00:08:04.137 --> 00:08:08.166\n&gt;&gt; I do and our editors, so\nwhether they be very rich like Word or\n\n139\n00:08:08.166 --> 00:08:12.940\nI use some simpler ones that\nare geared more toward programming.\n\n140\n00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.199\nThey offer all these helpers, and\nthen if you're without those, you're like,\n\n141\n00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:17.437\nI don't know what I'm doing.\n\n142\n00:08:17.437 --> 00:08:20.104\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You have all these assistive\n\n143\n00:08:20.104 --> 00:08:25.800\ntechnologies and you kinda just lose your\nway, amble around, you go, I don't know.\n\n144\n00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.760\nBut then, you adapt and it's all good.\n\n145\n00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.640\nBut email clients, sometimes they'll\ntell you about misspellings but\n\n146\n00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.580\nthey're not gonna force\ngrammatical rules and things.\n\n147\n00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.923\nAnd part of that is, well, is that\nreally important when discussing emails?\n\n148\n00:08:35.923 --> 00:08:36.652\nI can tell you,\n\n149\n00:08:36.652 --> 00:08:40.030\nthere have been times where I haven't\nworried about capitalization.\n\n150\n00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.740\nI would say, okay, and\njust quick reply or something like that.\n\n151\n00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.680\nSo I don't want this strict\ngrammatical enforcement,\n\n152\n00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.740\njust because it's outside of\nthe scope of what I care about.\n\n153\n00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.460\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's funny you talk about all of\nthese assistive technologies that we get\n\n154\n00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:58.170\nso used to, come back for the formatting\nmessages that we're going to do.\n\n155\n00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.150\nI think it's format message body, you'll\nsee some really interesting compare and\n\n156\n00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.400\ncontrasting when you talk\nabout your different browsers,\n\n157\n00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.490\nand how much I realize I'm very\ndependent on a lot of these things.\n\n158\n00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.990\nSo multiple recipients,\nthe different fields that we have in here,\n\n159\n00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.980\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nsend this off right now.\n\n160\n00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:23.260\nLet's talk about the Bcc field, this is\none that can get a little interesting.\n\n161\n00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.260\nWhat is it?\n\n162\n00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.050\nIt stands for Blind Carbon Copy.\n\n163\n00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.941\nAnd I'm gonna click it over here\non the right-hand side to show it,\n\n164\n00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:33.407\nbecause then it actually becomes an actual\nfield that I could start populating.\n\n165\n00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:35.734\nBut I do like it that\nit's off to the side and\n\n166\n00:09:35.734 --> 00:09:38.470\nthat you can click on it really quickly.\n\n167\n00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:43.700\nThe other things that you can do, it might\nshow up in here for once in a while.\n\n168\n00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.210\nAnd there is an option,\nactually I don't think it's in here,\n\n169\n00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:48.860\nI'm crossing two streams.\n\n170\n00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.876\nYou could set in your options, or\n\n171\n00:09:50.876 --> 00:09:55.632\nyour settings to where you always see\na Bcc field when you start a new messages.\n\n172\n00:09:55.632 --> 00:10:03.040\nAnd you could, in that same setting, you\ncould have it only showing it from field.\n\n173\n00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.350\nIt's like, why would I ever wanna\nhave it showing from field,\n\n174\n00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.300\nthe only person it's coming from is me.\n\n175\n00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.050\nWell, if you're managing\nmultiple email accounts, and\n\n176\n00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:15.410\nyou want to send an email out from your\naccount, or your boss's account, or\n\n177\n00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.250\nmaybe your other Gmail or Yahoo account,\n\n178\n00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:23.000\nthen you might wanna make sure you\nhave that from field showing as well.\n\n179\n00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.950\nSo you could go ahead and click on that,\nand to let you know where those settings\n\n180\n00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:32.540\nare, I just said it's somewhere in here,\nI know it's down in the Mail.\n\n181\n00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.012\nAnd then I believe you can go into your\n\n182\n00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:41.480\nmessage options, that's not it.\n\n183\n00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.930\nIt's in here, [LAUGH] I should have\nwritten it down exactly where it is at.\n\n184\n00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.570\nBut it is in here.\n\n185\n00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:50.450\n&gt;&gt; Actually, if you\n\n186\n00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.572\ngo back to the actual email-\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n187\n00:10:52.572 --> 00:10:53.457\n&gt;&gt; Never mind.\n\n188\n00:10:53.457 --> 00:10:55.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you for\nthat filler, though.\n\n189\n00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.240\nCuz I'm like, I will find it.\n\n190\n00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.240\nThose are the ones that hey,\nyou know what, this is real life.\n\n191\n00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.426\nI do this all the time, I know it's\nin here, I click on each single one.\n\n192\n00:11:03.426 --> 00:11:05.150\nIt's like, oop, there it is.\n\n193\n00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:09.260\nI usually write it in my show notes,\nbut I forgot where that was [LAUGH].\n\n194\n00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.280\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes we forget and that's okay.\n\n195\n00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.602\nAnd if you forget, you should emulate\njust what you saw from Vonne and\n\n196\n00:11:14.602 --> 00:11:17.809\njust start clicking around until\nyou start saving weird options,\n\n197\n00:11:17.809 --> 00:11:21.267\nyou're not really messing anything up so\ndon't be afraid to explore.\n\n198\n00:11:21.267 --> 00:11:25.288\nIt's not like you're gonna\nencounter a snake or a chupacabra,\n\n199\n00:11:25.288 --> 00:11:28.053\nyou're just gonna find some new messages.\n\n200\n00:11:28.053 --> 00:11:29.055\n&gt;&gt; Nice, yeah.\n\n201\n00:11:29.055 --> 00:11:31.739\n[LAUGH] Sorry, you said chupacabra and\nit just made me laugh.\n\n202\n00:11:31.739 --> 00:11:35.744\n[LAUGH] So here it is, [INAUDIBLE] wow,\n\n203\n00:11:35.744 --> 00:11:39.891\nthere and there, click or not click.\n\n204\n00:11:39.891 --> 00:11:43.542\n[LAUGH] And if you don't like it,\nyou can just always disregard it and\n\n205\n00:11:43.542 --> 00:11:44.810\ncome back, perfect.\n\n206\n00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.854\nSo, done with that let's go ahead and\nleave our options.\n\n207\n00:11:47.854 --> 00:11:52.206\nComing back into our messages, the nice\nthing is and sometimes when you're working\n\n208\n00:11:52.206 --> 00:11:56.740\nwith a single window that way, gosh did I\njust delete my email, it's still there,\n\n209\n00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.726\nyou just have to kinda move it around.\n\n210\n00:11:58.726 --> 00:12:03.340\nSo back to the Bcc, or\nwhat did you call it, the blind?\n\n211\n00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.210\n&gt;&gt; Well, in the previous episode,\nI called it the blind side carbon copy,\n\n212\n00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.690\nbecause it's something near and\ndear to my heart,\n\n213\n00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:14.070\njust like when we walk in the studios,\nand we don't know if the mics are on, and\n\n214\n00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:18.480\nwe should be respectful of our viewers or\nour members.\n\n215\n00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.313\nWell, we make sure that we keep everything\non the level, Bcc can blindside\n\n216\n00:12:23.313 --> 00:12:27.775\nyou if you're an email, you should\nalways keep things on the level.\n\n217\n00:12:27.775 --> 00:12:32.745\nYou should assume that everybody that you\nknow is reading your emails because well,\n\n218\n00:12:32.745 --> 00:12:34.076\nthey very well may be.\n\n219\n00:12:34.076 --> 00:12:37.759\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, gosh now I'm\ngetting little scared [LAUGH].\n\n220\n00:12:37.759 --> 00:12:45.060\nBecause what is it, it means that somebody\nis Cc'ed on this email but blindly.\n\n221\n00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:49.650\nSo let's go through a couple of\nscenarios of what Justin just said, and\n\n222\n00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.185\nwhere Bcc can be used, maybe for good.\n\n223\n00:12:52.185 --> 00:12:56.671\nIf I put, let's say I go ahead and\nput in Justin,\n\n224\n00:12:56.671 --> 00:13:01.200\nhere and I put in Lance and\nI put in Chris.\n\n225\n00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:09.000\nI put the three people into Bcc and I say\nhello, welcome to so on and so forth.\n\n226\n00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.410\nI'm addressing it to all the people\nthat are in the Bcc, but\n\n227\n00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:18.340\nwhen they receive the email, it looks to\nthem like it's only addressed to them.\n\n228\n00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:24.410\nIf it shows a Justin Timberlake,\nit only shows, to Justin Timberlake,\n\n229\n00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:29.190\ndoesn't show you Lance, or Chris, or\nmaybe the 700 other people that are Bcc'd\n\n230\n00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:33.830\nin this field, because you don't see that.\n\n231\n00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.090\nThat's the difference of putting\nin the Bcc versus the To field.\n\n232\n00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:42.180\nIf I put it all in the To field, everybody\ncan see each others email addresses, and\n\n233\n00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.380\nsometimes is not what you want.\n\n234\n00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:47.982\nI know I have examples of where I, back\nat the university I would manage multiple\n\n235\n00:13:47.982 --> 00:13:51.843\nadjuncts and I might be addressing\n40 to 50 people at one time.\n\n236\n00:13:51.843 --> 00:13:56.293\nAnd I need to send it to everybody,\ncuz this is a message for everybody, but\n\n237\n00:13:56.293 --> 00:13:59.910\nI don't want to have everybody,\nsee each other's emails.\n\n238\n00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:04.830\nIt's kind of like somewhat of a privacy\nin the sense in that way of hey,\n\n239\n00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.900\nit's just to you but\nit's also to other people.\n\n240\n00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:11.008\nAnd a lot of times what I'll say\nis you are bcc'd on this list.\n\n241\n00:14:11.008 --> 00:14:18.860\nSo they kinda know that this is kind of\nlike an email blast if you want to say.\n\n242\n00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.090\nBut you don't see everybody else.\n\n243\n00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.070\nIf I put somebody in the Cc field,\n\n244\n00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:29.410\nall the people that are addressed in\nthe Bcc will also see that as well.\n\n245\n00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:32.780\nIt still looks like it's addressed\nto them but they see the Cc.\n\n246\n00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:36.680\nSo a lot of times I'll put in, like if I\nwas sending a message out to everybody but\n\n247\n00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:41.390\nI also wanted to have the director\nknow that it was sent out.\n\n248\n00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.370\nAnd all those other people\nthat was sending it out, but\n\n249\n00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:47.940\nthe director was on it too back to that\nCc game, I would show that as well.\n\n250\n00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:54.850\nSo if you put anything in the To or the Cc\nfield with the Bcc, you see those top two.\n\n251\n00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.480\nI hope I didn't get too\nconfusing on that one.\n\n252\n00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.820\n&gt;&gt; I think we can break it down.\n\n253\n00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:03.843\nThe To is who you are formally addressing\nand they can all be in a group and\n\n254\n00:15:03.843 --> 00:15:04.905\nyou can just shout at them.\n\n255\n00:15:04.905 --> 00:15:08.620\nNot necessarily shout,\ndon't type in all caps, that's bad.\n\n256\n00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:14.330\nThe Cc are the bystanders that may be,\nwell, kind of in your peripheral vision.\n\n257\n00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.160\nPeople know they're there, but\nthey also know they're listening.\n\n258\n00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.780\nThe Bcc, well they're hanging\nfrom the ceiling in camo, kind of\n\n259\n00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:25.910\noverhearing all of your conversations and\nyou probably don't know they're there,\n\n260\n00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.760\nunless they directly tell you or\nidentify themselves.\n\n261\n00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.050\nAnd those are the things\nthat you need to be wary of.\n\n262\n00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:34.880\nOr not necessarily wary, it may not,\nas you say, this may not be a bad thing.\n\n263\n00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.870\nIt's to address maybe sensitive issues\nthat you need to address with a bunch of\n\n264\n00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:42.760\npeople, but you wanna make it\nlook like it's to them only, and\n\n265\n00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.720\nnot expose everybody else's identities.\n\n266\n00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.265\nYou just have to be aware that\nother people may be watching and\n\n267\n00:15:49.265 --> 00:15:51.893\nreading your emails,\nespecially when you reply and\n\n268\n00:15:51.893 --> 00:15:54.832\nthat reply all button shenanigans,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n269\n00:15:54.832 --> 00:15:58.990\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and that's where I say we're\nhaving a conversation where I have\n\n270\n00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:02.227\naddressed it to Justin and\nhe's addressing it back to me.\n\n271\n00:16:02.227 --> 00:16:07.081\nBut while I'm thinking that I'm just\ntalking to him, who knows if he's\n\n272\n00:16:07.081 --> 00:16:12.175\nputting Person x in the bcc field every\nsingle time he's replying to me, and\n\n273\n00:16:12.175 --> 00:16:18.350\nI never see that, even when I click reply\nor reply all, I'm never gonna see that.\n\n274\n00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:19.372\nSo like you say,\n\n275\n00:16:19.372 --> 00:16:23.391\njust always think somebody's\nhanging from the ceiling in camo.\n\n276\n00:16:23.391 --> 00:16:29.084\nI love that,\nbe aware of what you're saying anywhere.\n\n277\n00:16:29.084 --> 00:16:33.097\nBecause if it's in a email, kind of like\nif it's on the web it's out there forever,\n\n278\n00:16:33.097 --> 00:16:35.370\nthat's one of those things\njust to be careful.\n\n279\n00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.200\nAnd this doesn't have to scare you.\n\n280\n00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.783\nCuz a lot of people start getting a little\nlike, gosh, I'm never leaving my home.\n\n281\n00:16:39.783 --> 00:16:42.810\nI'm never gonna come\nout from under my rock.\n\n282\n00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.110\nYou just need to be aware.\n\n283\n00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.449\nSometimes, taking a breath,\nand saying you know what,\n\n284\n00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:50.287\nI'm not gonna answer that email\nright now cuz I'm a little fired up.\n\n285\n00:16:50.287 --> 00:16:53.700\nTake a breath and\njust think about what you're gonna say and\n\n286\n00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.581\nthat's where the BCC could be-\n&gt;&gt; As quick aside,\n\n287\n00:16:56.581 --> 00:17:01.671\nthat organizationally specific, if there\nare, if you're apart of a government\n\n288\n00:17:01.671 --> 00:17:06.469\nentity that doesn't have classification\nrules but has public record access\n\n289\n00:17:06.469 --> 00:17:11.050\nrules BCC may not work necessarily all\nthe way like you anticipate it to.\n\n290\n00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.660\nI could go make a public records request.\n\n291\n00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.930\nAnd some states I can get everybody,\nall recipients that are on that email,\n\n292\n00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.840\neven the ones that were\nblind carbon copied,\n\n293\n00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.540\nbecause that's part of the public\nrecord retention rules for that state.\n\n294\n00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:27.540\nSo something to keep in mind\nif you're like I can just do,\n\n295\n00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.782\nI always present it in an evil way but\nit does have its benefits.\n\n296\n00:17:31.782 --> 00:17:34.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, excellent point to make for sure.\n\n297\n00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.200\nSo if you type it and\nyou send it, it's there.\n\n298\n00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.029\nGreat, so all these different fields, and\n\n299\n00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:45.017\nunderstand that BCC the CC the To,\nand I'm gonna, you know?\n\n300\n00:17:45.017 --> 00:17:48.932\nI'm gonna go ahead and discard this\nbecause I don't really have anything to\n\n301\n00:17:48.932 --> 00:17:53.397\nsay and notice that when I have discarded\nit's saying, this message will be deleted,\n\n302\n00:17:53.397 --> 00:17:55.440\nso you wanna make sure you do that.\n\n303\n00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.650\nI do like that are you sure button.\n\n304\n00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.130\nSo that's always a good thing to do.\n\n305\n00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.116\nLet's talk about the Drafts folder for\na little bit.\n\n306\n00:18:02.116 --> 00:18:05.008\nWe mentioned it in part one,\nthat anytime you start typing,\n\n307\n00:18:05.008 --> 00:18:07.880\nthat's gonna go into that\nDrafts folder automatically.\n\n308\n00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.640\nIt's gonna save it for you.\n\n309\n00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.720\nThe Drafts are just like it sounds like,\n\n310\n00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:16.340\nit's a place where you're keeping your\ndrafts until you're ready to send it.\n\n311\n00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.289\nMaybe you started an email,\nyou got a phone call in the middle and\n\n312\n00:18:19.289 --> 00:18:22.345\nyou forgot it, you go back to lunch,\nyou come back and said man,\n\n313\n00:18:22.345 --> 00:18:25.534\nI need to send that email off It's\nhanging out in your drafts folder.\n\n314\n00:18:25.534 --> 00:18:29.490\nI have drafts folder, I have six of\nthem in here, I'm gonna click over here.\n\n315\n00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:35.870\nThis is the one like look it's like no\nsubject, no subject, half done, test save.\n\n316\n00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.890\nSo those are the one that I started\nan email, didn't really do much with it,\n\n317\n00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:43.560\nclosed it and\nI don't have anything in there, but\n\n318\n00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.950\nmaybe I addressed it to somebody.\n\n319\n00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:50.160\nSo it's just hanging out,\nready for me to address later for\n\n320\n00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:55.540\nexample I was playing around with how I'm\ngoing to be doing the format message body.\n\n321\n00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.548\nAnd the copy content and\nsome this copied information and\n\n322\n00:18:59.548 --> 00:19:03.486\nhow we're going to be formating\nit as I do this episode.\n\n323\n00:19:03.486 --> 00:19:07.215\nSo I saved it to kind of remind\nmyself of what I had done,\n\n324\n00:19:07.215 --> 00:19:12.828\ndon't wanna send it off I just wanna save\nit and that's where I put it in my drafts.\n\n325\n00:19:12.828 --> 00:19:16.330\nI'm gonna close that message and\nanything here.\n\n326\n00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.590\nThis is where sometimes you need\nto come into your draft folder and\n\n327\n00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:22.665\ndelete all of those not addressed\nno contact information.\n\n328\n00:19:22.665 --> 00:19:24.995\nAnd if you do that you just wanna hover.\n\n329\n00:19:24.995 --> 00:19:28.602\nI do like the hovering buttons\nthat are in the web interface,\n\n330\n00:19:28.602 --> 00:19:33.004\nto where I can just click this little\ntrash can right here really quickly.\n\n331\n00:19:33.004 --> 00:19:35.355\nOr I could always mark it as unread.\n\n332\n00:19:35.355 --> 00:19:38.948\nCuz any time you select\nit you've read the email.\n\n333\n00:19:38.948 --> 00:19:41.965\nWell sometimes I use that for\norganizational purposes.\n\n334\n00:19:41.965 --> 00:19:45.137\nI'll be like hey you didn't do anything\nbut I don't want you to forget this.\n\n335\n00:19:45.137 --> 00:19:49.370\nAnd then of course the other don't\nforget this, the flagging of the email.\n\n336\n00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:53.468\nWhat we'll talk about a little bit\nmore in depth in some other episodes.\n\n337\n00:19:53.468 --> 00:19:55.630\nAgain, I really like that hovering quick.\n\n338\n00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.270\nI want to delete this.\n\n339\n00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.845\nI don't actually want to delete that one,\nhere I'll do this one.\n\n340\n00:19:59.845 --> 00:20:01.940\nI'll delete that and then it goes where?\n\n341\n00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.770\nAnd then that goes into\nmy deleted items folder.\n\n342\n00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:10.290\nSo drafts are always good you can open\nthem back up, finish it, send it off.\n\n343\n00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:14.451\nAnd then once you do send it off,\nit won't be in your draft folder anymore.\n\n344\n00:20:14.451 --> 00:20:16.713\nThen it goes into your Sent Items.\n\n345\n00:20:18.367 --> 00:20:23.580\nThe Reply All button, we did talk about,\nhey, if you wanna change that default.\n\n346\n00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.100\nLet's move back over into our inbox and\n\n347\n00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.850\ngo into an email that I have\na multi a multi-people message.\n\n348\n00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.291\nOkay we'll go with that.\n\n349\n00:20:32.291 --> 00:20:37.150\n[LAUGH]\nI have it here if I wanted to\n\n350\n00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:42.039\nreply to all let's click the button\neverybody that it was addressed to is\n\n351\n00:20:42.039 --> 00:20:44.660\ngoing to be in that same reply.\n\n352\n00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:49.357\nTotally fine but I did mention\nthat maybe I didn't want to have\n\n353\n00:20:49.357 --> 00:20:53.526\nreply all as the default\nbutton I'm gonna close this.\n\n354\n00:20:53.526 --> 00:20:58.653\nI'm going to close this, and cuz I didn't\nreally do anything with it, open it\n\n355\n00:20:58.653 --> 00:21:04.030\nup one more time to get to the it's\nremembering this, so let's do this whoa.\n\n356\n00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.750\nYou know what I told you about this\nsingle click and the double click?\n\n357\n00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:07.400\nGuess what I did.\n\n358\n00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:12.533\n&gt;&gt; You gotta a little click happy,\nI've done it too and the worst is when you\n\n359\n00:21:12.533 --> 00:21:16.895\nget click happy, you're looking too much\nand then you got like Windows, on Windows,\n\n360\n00:21:16.895 --> 00:21:20.420\non Windows and I think it actually\nprevents you in the issue life of from\n\n361\n00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.245\nopening at a bunch of times up,\nyou're shaking your head no, I was wrong.\n\n362\n00:21:24.245 --> 00:21:25.988\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I haven't been click happy for\n\n363\n00:21:25.988 --> 00:21:26.804\na while so just be careful.\n\n364\n00:21:26.804 --> 00:21:31.577\nClick once, give it some time,\ndouble click it,\n\n365\n00:21:31.577 --> 00:21:37.386\ngive it some time, and\nthen if nothing happens then, well.\n\n366\n00:21:37.386 --> 00:21:38.165\n&gt;&gt; Click it again.\n\n367\n00:21:38.165 --> 00:21:39.332\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Click it again.\n\n368\n00:21:39.332 --> 00:21:41.190\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n369\n00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.095\n&gt;&gt; So, that's our three steps of clicks.\n\n370\n00:21:43.095 --> 00:21:46.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Where I'm\nback to is the button,\n\n371\n00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.520\nI was trying to get back\nto the button right there.\n\n372\n00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.820\nSo the more buttons or the more actions,\nthere is an option right here,\n\n373\n00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.420\nthe Change Default.\n\n374\n00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:59.106\nI don't want it to be Reply All,\nI want it to be Reply.\n\n375\n00:21:59.106 --> 00:22:05.040\nSo that way it's not just a quick\nfix to hit the Reply All,\n\n376\n00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:09.180\nbecause maybe in this particular email,\nit says it's all two people but\n\n377\n00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:14.440\nI just want to reply to Justin, just like\nhey I'm gonna have to be out on vacation,\n\n378\n00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.230\nand I really don't need the rest\nof the group to see it.\n\n379\n00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:23.600\nSo I can click that reply button and\nnow it is just to that particular person.\n\n380\n00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.830\nBut changing that default\nI take his little handy.\n\n381\n00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:30.155\nAnd I've already done it\nmy personal accounts.\n\n382\n00:22:30.155 --> 00:22:33.830\nSo I wanted to show you\nwhere that is around.\n\n383\n00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:37.726\nBut when you do have the reply all,\nor maybe I hit the reply and\n\n384\n00:22:37.726 --> 00:22:39.803\nI didn't want certain people.\n\n385\n00:22:39.803 --> 00:22:41.580\nYou could still go ahead and\ndelete people.\n\n386\n00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:46.830\nYou can move the around to the CC fields\njust like we did when we were addressing,\n\n387\n00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:51.240\nan email with multiple people so\nyou have those same options and\n\n388\n00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.700\nthat's how you can change your default.\n\n389\n00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.620\nI will close this window here.\n\n390\n00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:58.490\nDouble checking to make sure I don't\nhave multiple windows open from\n\n391\n00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.210\ngetting a little too click happy there.\n\n392\n00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:01.786\nAnd I will go ahead and\n\n393\n00:23:01.786 --> 00:23:05.823\ndiscard the changes that I\nhad made in my reading pane.\n\n394\n00:23:05.823 --> 00:23:10.910\nAnd now, we're going to move\non to forwarding a message.\n\n395\n00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:13.120\nNow, what is forwarding?\n\n396\n00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.841\nIt's, hey,\n\n397\n00:23:13.841 --> 00:23:18.064\nI'm gonna forward this on to you, I don't\nknow how many other words to say it.\n\n398\n00:23:18.064 --> 00:23:22.357\nI am taking an email that I already have,\nand\n\n399\n00:23:22.357 --> 00:23:27.705\nI'm just sending it to you\nfrom somebody else, okay.\n\n400\n00:23:27.705 --> 00:23:31.598\nAnd you can still compose some\ninformation into it if you want to, but\n\n401\n00:23:31.598 --> 00:23:34.700\nit's kind of like a pass along,\nremember hot potato?\n\n402\n00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.780\nYou pass, pass ,pass pass.\n\n403\n00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.937\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I was always bad at that game\nit just made me sick, thanks for\n\n404\n00:23:39.937 --> 00:23:43.579\nmaking me relive that Vonne, but\nit's okay, I'll let you by this time.\n\n405\n00:23:43.579 --> 00:23:47.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, thank you, sorry about\nthat, believe me there's many times I was\n\n406\n00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.317\nlike this is like a flashback from\nmiddle school like I got to run away So,\n\n407\n00:23:51.317 --> 00:23:52.670\nI want to forward a message.\n\n408\n00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.855\nLet's go down here to\none that Chris sent me.\n\n409\n00:23:55.855 --> 00:24:00.599\nSo, this is from Chris and maybe there's\nsome great information in this email that\n\n410\n00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:04.258\nI need to pass along to Justin Timberlake,\nor Justin Dennison,\n\n411\n00:24:04.258 --> 00:24:06.722\nwhichever Justin I feel like addressing.\n\n412\n00:24:06.722 --> 00:24:10.513\nBut I just wanna take all this,\nmove it on.\n\n413\n00:24:10.513 --> 00:24:14.710\nI'm gonna click the little drop down\nbutton, and I'm going to choose Forward.\n\n414\n00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:18.450\nI want to forward this email\nonto another person, and\n\n415\n00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:21.820\nnotice when I do that,\nin the subject it puts that Fw.\n\n416\n00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:26.290\nSo that way, the recipient knows, hey,\n\n417\n00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:30.210\nyou're getting a forwarded\nemail from Joey.\n\n418\n00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:36.680\nBut its the email from Chris that Joey\nreceived, so just moving it on along.\n\n419\n00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:43.103\nAnd I can address this to Justin Ford,\n\n420\n00:24:43.103 --> 00:24:50.344\nand I can say take\na look at Chris's email.\n\n421\n00:24:50.344 --> 00:24:55.380\nSo you can still go ahead and\nadd whatever information you need in here.\n\n422\n00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:59.360\nSometimes I would do this with a lot\nof the people that I was working with.\n\n423\n00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:03.086\nMaybe there was an alert from the IT\ndepartment at the university,\n\n424\n00:25:03.086 --> 00:25:07.809\nI was talking about different changes that\nwe're gonna be coming up on the network,\n\n425\n00:25:07.809 --> 00:25:10.270\nhey, just making sure you got this.\n\n426\n00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:14.920\nOr with any other organization that maybe\nthey weren't on that distribution list or\n\n427\n00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.440\nthat mass email list, so\nI'd forward it along to say hey,\n\n428\n00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.398\nmake sure you go ahead and check this out.\n\n429\n00:25:19.398 --> 00:25:23.645\nIn the flip-side, you could\nalways take a forwarded email and\n\n430\n00:25:23.645 --> 00:25:27.861\nyou could get rid of all of this\nextra information sometimes.\n\n431\n00:25:27.861 --> 00:25:30.390\nLike, so I just wanted to show you this,\n\n432\n00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:33.483\nyou don't need to see, cuz I might have\nhad it forwarded, forwarded, forwarded,\n\n433\n00:25:33.483 --> 00:25:38.430\nI don't want all the extra in the middle\npart, you can delete all that out.\n\n434\n00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:43.400\nYou technically can go ahead and\ndelete out the Fw: in the subject,\n\n435\n00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.490\nso it doesn't even look\nlike a forwarded email.\n\n436\n00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:48.380\nIt's just coming from you and\n\n437\n00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.429\nthey don't see all of that other\ninformation in the middle of it.\n\n438\n00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:58.100\nIt's still some type of information\nthat you have control over\n\n439\n00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.220\nto be able to send it\nalong however you want to.\n\n440\n00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.590\nThat is the button where you\nknow you have forwarded it.\n\n441\n00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:09.420\nI will go ahead and send this and\nnow I have forwarded it.\n\n442\n00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:14.780\nThe only other thing I wanted to\naddress would be printing an email,\n\n443\n00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:20.190\nif you ever needed to have a hard\nphysical copy of somebody's email.\n\n444\n00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:23.000\nI did that double clicking again,\nhere we go,\n\n445\n00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.980\nthat's fine,\nwe can totally double-click it.\n\n446\n00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.310\nI really wanna double-click today now,\ndon't I?\n\n447\n00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.780\n&gt;&gt; Teaching by counter example.\n\n448\n00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.470\nIt's one of my favorite methods.\n\n449\n00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:32.694\nI'm gonna show you the things not to do,\nso don't do them.\n\n450\n00:26:32.694 --> 00:26:36.000\nDo as I say, not as I do,\nthat's an important point to remember.\n\n451\n00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.480\n&gt;&gt; And you can totally double-click,\nit's not wrong,\n\n452\n00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.079\nif you wanna open up, it's just.\n\n453\n00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.640\nI'm expecting it to open\nup the single one and\n\n454\n00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.720\nI'm not even understanding what I'm doing.\n\n455\n00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.169\nWow, cuz you feel like,\nand you're teaching us?\n\n456\n00:26:50.169 --> 00:26:53.940\n[LAUGH] But back here to in the message,\n\n457\n00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:58.210\ncuz there's always more\nthan one wrong [LAUGH].\n\n458\n00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:02.160\n&gt;&gt; There's always more than one\nway to accomplish the same task.\n\n459\n00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.340\nAnd that's pretty uniform\nthroughout most technologies.\n\n460\n00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.830\nSo if you're like,\nwell I found this other way,\n\n461\n00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:12.590\nyou very well may have, but we go\nthrough the more commonly accepted ones.\n\n462\n00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:16.870\n&gt;&gt; And I was trying to say,\nthere's more than one right way and\n\n463\n00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:20.860\nI one more wrong way and\nI was like, ew, okay that is too.\n\n464\n00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:24.020\n&gt;&gt; But behind my head just to show\nyou that in the bottom of this\n\n465\n00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:28.370\ndrop down I have Print, so\nI could go ahead and take this message,\n\n466\n00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:33.220\nsend it out to my printer options,\nthere we go.\n\n467\n00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.715\nSo now I have, wow, here we go, yay.\n\n468\n00:27:35.715 --> 00:27:40.960\n[LAUGH] My Edge is configuring and\ntrying to find the printer\n\n469\n00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:46.040\nthat this is connected to and this is a\nnetworked printer over in the over office.\n\n470\n00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.400\nSo I could take and\n\n471\n00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.920\nchange any of the options that I\nmight need to have this printed out.\n\n472\n00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.430\nNow this is connected to your browser.\n\n473\n00:27:55.430 --> 00:28:00.860\nSo depending on what browser\nyou have your print dialog box\n\n474\n00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.700\ncould look different, I am using Edge.\n\n475\n00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.250\nSo if you're using Chrome or\n\n476\n00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:09.340\nSafari you might have a little bit\ndifferent things going on here.\n\n477\n00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.990\nBut the concept is if I wanted to\nprint where do I find the button?\n\n478\n00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:17.510\nIt's in that actions button on that\nparticular email, and then you could send\n\n479\n00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:22.070\nit to your printer and draw pretty little\npictures all over it if you wanted to.\n\n480\n00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.540\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne, you've definitively\neliminated a few things for us, and\n\n481\n00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:28.170\nby a few things, I mean a lot.\n\n482\n00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:30.420\nThere was a great deal there.\n\n483\n00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.780\nAnd remember, carbon copy, too, and\nblind carbon copy, to some extent,\n\n484\n00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.290\nit's a semantic difference.\n\n485\n00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.370\nBut it's an important one to remember.\n\n486\n00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:40.680\nAlso that print function that\nshe was just talking about.\n\n487\n00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.930\nIf you're an unsupported browser,\nyou may get some weird print.\n\n488\n00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:49.600\nLike it'll actually print the Outlook\ninterface instead of the actual email.\n\n489\n00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.535\nSo if you get some weirdness,\nyou may have to try out another browser.\n\n490\n00:28:52.535 --> 00:28:56.090\nBut we're not done with actually\ninteracting with email, so\n\n491\n00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:58.720\nyou should join us back for a part three.\n\n492\n00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.780\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for OfficeProTV.\n\n493\n00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.390\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n494\n00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:03.170\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n495\n00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:07.043\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n496\n00:29:07.043 -->

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:10.619\nI'm your host Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.439\nAnd well we're coming\nback with a part three.\n\n5\n00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:17.297\nYeah, a part three on mail basics for\nOutlook on the web.\n\n6\n00:00:17.297 --> 00:00:21.069\nAnd here to help us along, to make sure\nwe don't get lost and wonder off, Ms.\n\n7\n00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:21.790\nVonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:22.730\nHow do you doing today, Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.032\n&gt;&gt; I'm good.\nTalking about wandering off,\n\n10\n00:00:25.032 --> 00:00:30.428\nwe're gonna talk about missing attachments\nthat have somehow just wandered off and\n\n11\n00:00:30.428 --> 00:00:34.311\nnot gone on to my email,\nwhich I have done a couple times too.\n\n12\n00:00:34.311 --> 00:00:37.606\n[LAUGH] We are people just like you.\n\n13\n00:00:37.606 --> 00:00:41.482\nAnd yeah, I have sent an email off\nthat says, hey, just go ahead and\n\n14\n00:00:41.482 --> 00:00:44.280\nmake sure you look at\neverything on this report.\n\n15\n00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.170\nSent it out to 25 people, and I start\ngetting like no attachment, no attachment.\n\n16\n00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.364\nI'm like, sorry, and\nI had to bring it on back.\n\n17\n00:00:51.364 --> 00:00:55.950\nSo we can always make sure that,\nthat is actually a point right there is\n\n18\n00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.320\nalways check your email\nbefore you send it.\n\n19\n00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.390\nAnd checking your name,\nam I addressing it to the right person?\n\n20\n00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.860\nDo I have the subject line?\n\n21\n00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.840\nDid I attach the file that I\nsaid I was going to attach?\n\n22\n00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.830\nAnd did I spell everything right?\n\n23\n00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.050\nDid I say from, instead of form?\n\n24\n00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.613\nProofing is always a good thing to do.\n\n25\n00:01:14.613 --> 00:01:19.002\nAnd the nice thing about these attachments\nthat may have wandered off the page, or\n\n26\n00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:21.878\nreally wandered off from\nour memory of attaching it.\n\n27\n00:01:21.878 --> 00:01:24.900\nAt least you have a little bit\nof a warning system in here.\n\n28\n00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.570\nSo I wanna show you what that means.\n\n29\n00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.187\nAnd we're also gonna talk about,\nhey I had sent it to the wrong person and\n\n30\n00:01:30.187 --> 00:01:33.625\nI got a warning, and we're gonna\ndo a like, yeah that was actually,\n\n31\n00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:37.745\nyes there is a button that looks just like\nthis, and we're gonna like some stuff.\n\n32\n00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:40.780\nAnd then we're gonna talk\nabout deleting our emails.\n\n33\n00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.900\nLet's jump on in.\n\n34\n00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.420\nWe've got Joey's email here.\n\n35\n00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.395\nUndeliverable emails.\n\n36\n00:01:47.395 --> 00:01:50.773\nNow I went head in send off two emails,\n\n37\n00:01:50.773 --> 00:01:56.800\nwell I never actually sent them off,\nbecause I typed them in wrong.\n\n38\n00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.210\nAnd notice here in my inbox,\nI have from Microsoft Outlook that I have\n\n39\n00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.666\nthis little icon right there, that looks\nlike arrows with little lines off of it.\n\n40\n00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:14.391\nThis is an indication to me that\nI have an undeliverable message,\n\n41\n00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:17.420\nI have a warning, let's open it.\n\n42\n00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.980\nOpen this from Microsoft Outlook and\nit is saying I did that double clicking.\n\n43\n00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.889\nAgain, I think it's just double click day,\nyou know what?\n\n44\n00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:29.492\nThat's what we're going to deem this as,\nnothing wrong with it, but it says,\n\n45\n00:02:29.492 --> 00:02:33.202\nI can't request, actually,\n[LAUGH] it just saying, no Vonne,\n\n46\n00:02:33.202 --> 00:02:37.087\nyou ain't gonna have it so-\n&gt;&gt; You have already double clicked it into\n\n47\n00:02:37.087 --> 00:02:39.027\nnon existence, you went click happy\n\n48\n00:02:39.027 --> 00:02:40.216\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it's broke.\n\n49\n00:02:40.216 --> 00:02:42.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So what should we do?\n\n50\n00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.550\nWell I always like the IT go to,\nhave you tried cutting it off and\n\n51\n00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.092\nturning it back on again.\n\n52\n00:02:48.092 --> 00:02:49.219\nAnd in this case,\n\n53\n00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:53.740\nclosing the window and seeing what\nhappens if we try to bring it back up.\n\n54\n00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.866\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I broke the internet.\n\n55\n00:02:54.866 --> 00:02:59.640\n[LAUGH] With all of my famous things of,\nhey I double click too much.\n\n56\n00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.716\nSo back in here as I have single\nclicked to select this and\n\n57\n00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:06.332\nshow it in the main area right here.\n\n58\n00:03:06.332 --> 00:03:10.906\nIt tells me that,\ndelivery has failed to these recipients.\n\n59\n00:03:10.906 --> 00:03:14.921\nAnd if I look at what is wrong with this,\n\n60\n00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:19.910\nthat was a whole,\nI had Lance's email in there,\n\n61\n00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.690\nin the suggested ones and\nit's doing the wrong one.\n\n62\n00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.910\nSo it's in the format of\nwhat an email needs to have.\n\n63\n00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.560\nThere's nothing wrong with this.\n\n64\n00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.985\nIt has a name, it has an at symbol,\nso that's fine.\n\n65\n00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:42.490\nOfficeprodemoco.com, so\nit has a top level domain.\n\n66\n00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.940\nIt has the sub domain if you wanna call it\nor the main address, and it has a name and\n\n67\n00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.720\nit has an at symbol.\n\n68\n00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.400\nSo there would be nothing wrong\nwhen I check the name of this.\n\n69\n00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.080\nI'll tell you what I mean, and I'll\ndemonstrate that in just a second when I\n\n70\n00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.120\nmake a new email and I'll show\nyou the check name functionality.\n\n71\n00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.110\nBut it wouldn't have caught this.\n\n72\n00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.480\nIt kind of goes back to the beginning\nof the show where I said always proof.\n\n73\n00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.200\nThis would not come up as a mistake,\nit's correct,\n\n74\n00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.220\nbut you missed the whole other part of it.\n\n75\n00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.530\nSo it's letting you know\nthat it can't be received.\n\n76\n00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.213\nAnd this is where reading your\nundeliverable messages that come back\n\n77\n00:04:21.213 --> 00:04:24.937\nfrom Microsoft Outlook or\njust Microsoft in general.\n\n78\n00:04:24.937 --> 00:04:28.006\nRead these,\nnow sometimes you might feel like, okay,\n\n79\n00:04:28.006 --> 00:04:31.875\nthe DNS report the recipient like,\nI don't even know what DNS means.\n\n80\n00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:37.550\nBut at least sometimes it will show\nyou maybe there's a size limitation,\n\n81\n00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.230\nor not receivable, or\nemail doesn't exist, so read them.\n\n82\n00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.209\nSometimes you can decipher, hey that\nperson just doesn't exist anymore or\n\n83\n00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:52.108\nthey can't receive my email, because\nmy attachment is too large to be able\n\n84\n00:04:52.108 --> 00:04:55.170\nto go through the channels\nthat it needs to be.\n\n85\n00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:01.570\nSo watch these ones, let me go back and\nclose here, come back to another delivery.\n\n86\n00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.837\nAnd I clicked it again.\n\n87\n00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:06.110\n&gt;&gt; You do love double clicking.\n\n88\n00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.669\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n89\n00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:07.401\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n90\n00:05:07.401 --> 00:05:10.490\nwhile we're resolving that shenanigans,\nright?\n\n91\n00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.530\nJust something to reiterate.\n\n92\n00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.450\nTypically, this message have this\ntop level like error, right?\n\n93\n00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.429\nDelivery has failed to these recipients or\ngroups, and then you get this list.\n\n94\n00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.840\nA lot of times the first thing I do,\nbefore I even read the rest of it,\n\n95\n00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.310\nis I just look back through the email real\nquick, because after a second glance it's\n\n96\n00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.850\nalready went out and come back to you,\nyou're like, I put an extra M in there.\n\n97\n00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:32.510\nThat's not right.\n\n98\n00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.750\nBut keep in mind, right below those list\nof emails you do get that specification.\n\n99\n00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.070\nSometimes it's a little tech heavy, but\nyou can pick out keywords like attachment,\n\n100\n00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.310\nbig or large or something like that.\n\n101\n00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.560\nAnd so even if you don't know what a DNS\nis or whatever, you just wanna use email.\n\n102\n00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.950\nYou can still pick out, right,\n\n103\n00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.200\nthe DNS, that's not the part I care about,\nrecipient's domain does not exist.\n\n104\n00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.080\nRecipient does not exist, and\nthat's all you really need to know.\n\n105\n00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.350\nThat probably means that the email's down,\nwhat I mean is it doesn't exist,\n\n106\n00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.670\nor you've typed an extra letter or\n\n107\n00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:11.090\nyou mistyped something, or you just copied\nit wrong or something of that nature.\n\n108\n00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.463\n&gt;&gt; Or you've said Microoooosoft.\n\n109\n00:06:14.463 --> 00:06:19.422\n[LAUGH] It's like okay, I've had a couple\nof different o's, I forgot an i and\n\n110\n00:06:19.422 --> 00:06:23.030\nthis is one of those PEBCAC\nerrors that we love, right?\n\n111\n00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:29.148\nThe PEBCAC error is my favorite, it's the\nproblem exists between computer and chair.\n\n112\n00:06:29.148 --> 00:06:34.552\nYes, so [LAUGH] sometimes that happens.\n\n113\n00:06:34.552 --> 00:06:36.676\nSo check these deliverables, but\n\n114\n00:06:36.676 --> 00:06:41.813\nit's usually almost immediate like when\nyou send it, it will kind of bounce back.\n\n115\n00:06:41.813 --> 00:06:45.360\nAnd this is like people say,\nmy, your email bounced.\n\n116\n00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.050\nThis is what they're talking about,\nit's like it bounced back to me and\n\n117\n00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:55.760\nit didn't get out, it did not send out\npass my outbox and I never got it to you.\n\n118\n00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.820\nThe bounced emails is your undeliverables,\nit happens.\n\n119\n00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.010\nAnd so check those messages out.\n\n120\n00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.130\nNow the check name that\nI had mentioned before.\n\n121\n00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.120\nLet's start a new email.\n\n122\n00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.770\nAnd we're going to address this.\n\n123\n00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.325\nAnd I'm gonna type this out,\nand I'm gonna say\n\n124\n00:07:13.325 --> 00:07:22.930\njustin@officeprodemoco.com.\n\n125\n00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.680\nThat is a valid email address.\n\n126\n00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:31.510\nWe talked about the at,\nthe dot, the top level domain.\n\n127\n00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.923\nIn the dot, dot, or the ellipses up here,\n\n128\n00:07:33.923 --> 00:07:38.010\nyou have the option of checking\nnames to make sure Hade is exist.\n\n129\n00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.845\nIf I click on that it's gonna say,\nnope, it looks fine, nothing wrong.\n\n130\n00:07:42.845 --> 00:07:46.292\nThat could be a valid email address.\n\n131\n00:07:46.292 --> 00:07:50.630\nBut if you had just\ntyped in justin.com and\n\n132\n00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:56.788\nwent to check names,\nsee where it says, no match was found.\n\n133\n00:07:56.788 --> 00:08:00.770\nIf it doesn't pull out\na little bubble around it.\n\n134\n00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.024\nThen something's wrong.\n\n135\n00:08:02.024 --> 00:08:06.270\nIt's saying, I can't even determine\nthat this is even gonna work.\n\n136\n00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:11.450\nThere's no at symbol,\nthere's not a complete email address.\n\n137\n00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:17.340\nSo the check names can be very handy for\nsome of your errors, but not all of them.\n\n138\n00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.030\nSo I wouldn't rely on that as,\nhey, I'm good.\n\n139\n00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:25.360\nI'm not gonna have any problems,\nor any undeliverable errors,\n\n140\n00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.990\nthat's gonna happen to me.\n\n141\n00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.560\n&gt;&gt; And I can provide some insight on that.\n\n142\n00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.800\nFrom a programmatic standpoint, validating\nemail addresses is actually pretty hard,\n\n143\n00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.555\nwhen you're building some kinda user form.\n\n144\n00:08:34.555 --> 00:08:38.915\nWell, you can check the format, there's an\nat symbol, and you have that domain, and\n\n145\n00:08:38.915 --> 00:08:41.000\nthen kind of your extension.\n\n146\n00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.460\nYou could possibly send that like a lead\nemail, but then that clutters up things.\n\n147\n00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.800\nSo probably what's happening, and\nI'm postulating here, I'm not saying for\n\n148\n00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.190\ncertain, that this is what happening,\nthey're using regular expressions to make\n\n149\n00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:58.270\nsure these are just so, and they may do\na quick check, may, may do a quick check,\n\n150\n00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:02.940\nto see if that domain name actually exists\nanywhere, with some kind of DNS service.\n\n151\n00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.200\nBut beyond that,\n\n152\n00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.780\nit's really hard to validate whether\nan email address exists until you send it,\n\n153\n00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.050\nand then it tries to resolve it,\nand then you get that kickback.\n\n154\n00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:16.330\nSo even with this check name,\nyou still may get a DNS undeliverable, or\n\n155\n00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:21.060\nexcuse me, a mail undeliverable,\nnot necessarily just a DNS issue.\n\n156\n00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or\nyou sent it to the wrong person.\n\n157\n00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.220\nI had, it was somebody's name at\ngmail.com, and it was just her last name,\n\n158\n00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:33.330\nbut the real email was, like the first\nletter of the name was before it,\n\n159\n00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.174\nand somebody else wrote me back,\nand was like, mm.\n\n160\n00:09:36.174 --> 00:09:40.173\nI'm like, ooh, that's why I didn't send\nyou anything that was a little sensitive\n\n161\n00:09:40.173 --> 00:09:42.780\nabout information, so it could happen.\n\n162\n00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.040\nI'm going to delete this in my to field,\nand I am going to remove this,\n\n163\n00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.100\nand let's put in Justin Timberlake's\nactual email address.\n\n164\n00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.060\nAnd sometimes with that check names,\nespecially if I'm using\n\n165\n00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:58.310\nwithin my organization, I'll use that\nto verify against the global addresses,\n\n166\n00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.472\ncuz maybe I didn't realize that\nperson was in the address list, and\n\n167\n00:10:01.472 --> 00:10:04.790\nsometimes, you get like,\ntheir picture will come up.\n\n168\n00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.300\nAnd maybe like a different display name\nwill happen because you typed in their\n\n169\n00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.850\nemail and I typed in JT at office for\ndemo code, and\n\n170\n00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.440\nit changed to Justin Timberlake,\nit's like, wait, how did that happen?\n\n171\n00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.350\nThat's just part of the contact, or\nthe information, that is listed for\n\n172\n00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:22.960\nthat particular person that it recognizes.\n\n173\n00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.330\nSo, if that ever happens, that's okay.\n\n174\n00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.470\nSo that was the checked names.\n\n175\n00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.840\nThe other one I wanted to\ndemonstrate in this example is that\n\n176\n00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.626\nwandered off attachment, let's say file.\n\n177\n00:10:34.626 --> 00:10:38.331\nPlease see\n\n178\n00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:44.990\nattached file, and\nI will even say file attached.\n\n179\n00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.490\nLet's pretend I can type and\nspell correctly.\n\n180\n00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:54.500\nSo I've set it multiple places,\nsee attached file, file attached.\n\n181\n00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.610\nI've used words and phrases,\n\n182\n00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:01.240\nthat are indicating that I'm supposed\nto have an attachment in here.\n\n183\n00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.354\nWhen I click the Send button,\nthat what is it,\n\n184\n00:11:05.354 --> 00:11:09.370\nthat the assistant-\n&gt;&gt; Assistive technologies, right?\n\n185\n00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.440\nI can't tell you how many\ntimes I've done this,\n\n186\n00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.050\nback in the days before\nthis was an actual feature.\n\n187\n00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:15.370\nLike see this attached file,\n\n188\n00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.220\npeople are like I don't know\nwhat you're talking about.\n\n189\n00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:18.970\nThey just looked at me.\n\n190\n00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.700\nWell I assumed they were staring\nat their screen, like I was crazy.\n\n191\n00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:26.104\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that, like the said,\nThey was emailing me back and\n\n192\n00:11:26.104 --> 00:11:28.850\nI would get, bing, I'm like sorry.\n\n193\n00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:33.830\n[LAUGH] I like that it is giving me this,\nyou might have,\n\n194\n00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.730\nyou may have forgotten the attachment,\n\n195\n00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:43.100\ncuz I could have used attachment or\nattach In another context,\n\n196\n00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:48.180\nbesides I'm trying to send you a file,\nalong with this email.\n\n197\n00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.420\nSo sometimes it's right,\n\n198\n00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.960\nsometimes it's not right, but\nat least it's giving me enough.\n\n199\n00:11:53.960 --> 00:12:01.030\nNow maybe I have not used enough phrases\nor keywords that it recognized for\n\n200\n00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.980\nit, to give me this this warning, and\nI really did mean to attach it, and again,\n\n201\n00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:11.950\njust like one of those check names, don't\nalways rely on this, it could be wrong.\n\n202\n00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:15.710\nSo I'm not going to send this,\ncuz I would like to go ahead and\n\n203\n00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:19.190\nattach a file from my computer.\n\n204\n00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.995\nNow, a little trick that I like to do,\n\n205\n00:12:21.995 --> 00:12:26.209\nwe talked about clicking the add\nan attachment button for\n\n206\n00:12:26.209 --> 00:12:30.974\nour, well, this button,\nnot the paper note, the paper clip.\n\n207\n00:12:30.974 --> 00:12:35.400\n[LAUGH] That we attach a note to, I think\nthat's where I blended two words together.\n\n208\n00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:41.480\nYou could also drag and\ndrop files from outside of your browser,\n\n209\n00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.930\nor on your computer, right into it.\n\n210\n00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:49.060\nI'm going to minimize my browser down,\nto show my desktop,\n\n211\n00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:56.360\nand if I wanted to send Justin this email\ntechnology PowerPoint Presentation,\n\n212\n00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:01.180\nI can take it from here, drag it all\nthe way in here, notice how like I have\n\n213\n00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.430\nto make sure I'm dropping in the right\nplace, and right there, that's not gonna,\n\n214\n00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:09.880\nI was, it's trying to give\nme that little x mark there.\n\n215\n00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.110\nI want to put it right there.\n\n216\n00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:16.150\nIf it says drop it there, let go,\nand it goes ahead and attaches it.\n\n217\n00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.880\nI love that little trick, I love doing\nthat by just, I need this, boom,\n\n218\n00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.330\nboom, boom, drop it in.\n\n219\n00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:22.730\nI can go ahead and get another one.\n\n220\n00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:24.870\nI can grab this one, drop it in there.\n\n221\n00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:30.840\nYou could also do it in reverse,\nif you receive files with attachments,\n\n222\n00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:35.200\nyou could drag and\ndrop it from that section, and\n\n223\n00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.360\nput it on to your desktop and download it.\n\n224\n00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.240\nThere's no air quotes on that one,\nyou're just really downloading your file.\n\n225\n00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:47.980\nSo I like the drag and\ndrop method, for your attachments.\n\n226\n00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.960\nI'm going to save this.\n\n227\n00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:55.670\nNow I know it's being autosaved,\nbut maybe I just wanna make sure.\n\n228\n00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:58.090\nCome up to the Docs &gt; Save Draft.\n\n229\n00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:02.730\nIt's kinda like there's no disk button and\nthat sometimes, it's like,\n\n230\n00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.080\nmaybe it's just a mental thing.\n\n231\n00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.980\nCuz I've gotten so into save, save, save,\n\n232\n00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.550\ndon't forget to save, cuz you don't\nwant to delete all your changes.\n\n233\n00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:13.840\nSo, making it commit my draft changes and\n\n234\n00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.270\nthen closing my email,\nit kinda makes me feel better.\n\n235\n00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:23.380\nI know it's gonna be saved, but just\nin case, cuz I wanna save it for later.\n\n236\n00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:29.280\nWell I wanted to come over into\nan email that was sent by Justin to me,\n\n237\n00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.140\nand I, look what I did.\n\n238\n00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.330\nI single clicked.\n\n239\n00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.277\nI did not double click.\n\n240\n00:14:33.277 --> 00:14:34.640\n&gt;&gt; I am incredibly proud of you.\n\n241\n00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.645\nI mean,\nI don't know if I've been prouder today.\n\n242\n00:14:36.645 --> 00:14:39.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Than I am right now.\n\n243\n00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.650\n&gt;&gt; I think it's what, you just get\nin a loop, and you keep it, and\n\n244\n00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.880\nit was like, stop doing that.\n\n245\n00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.200\nSo you got to witness that, and hopefully\nyou're getting a good chuckle out of it,\n\n246\n00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.885\nbecause, hopefully, you've done it too.\n\n247\n00:14:49.885 --> 00:14:54.240\n[LAUGH] So now that I've single-clicked\nto open the email right here, and\n\n248\n00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:59.550\nI have the attachments,\nI can actually see some of the previews,\n\n249\n00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.570\nlike there is a png, a picture in here.\n\n250\n00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.490\nI have a picture here.\n\n251\n00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:08.762\nEach one of these attachments, I can\ndrop-down, the little droppy down, and\n\n252\n00:15:08.762 --> 00:15:10.310\nget to, can I preview this?\n\n253\n00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:11.220\nCan I download it?\n\n254\n00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.830\nOr save it to OneDrive?\n\n255\n00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.248\nWe mentioned that in Part 1,\nwhen we were attaching files.\n\n256\n00:15:16.248 --> 00:15:18.048\nNow on the receiving end,\nthis is where, ooh,\n\n257\n00:15:18.048 --> 00:15:20.420\nmaybe I do just want to put\nthis right into my OneDrive.\n\n258\n00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.070\nCuz maybe you put everything\nin your Cloud Storage.\n\n259\n00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.170\nYou don't wanna save\nanything on your computer.\n\n260\n00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.050\nYou wanna save everything in your Cloud.\n\n261\n00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.860\nThat just depends on\nthe policy of your company.\n\n262\n00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.540\nI know with us it's like, don't ever\nsave anything on your local drive.\n\n263\n00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.960\nYou have to put everything up on\nthe network drive, because you never know,\n\n264\n00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.110\ncomputers crash.\n\n265\n00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.570\nYou just need to make sure\nyou put everything up there.\n\n266\n00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:41.120\nSo that's nice that it's there.\n\n267\n00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:46.076\nI wanted to go to the preview, and\nshow you that it brings it up into almost\n\n268\n00:15:46.076 --> 00:15:51.464\nlike another screen, another window,\nand the preview's pretty nice.\n\n269\n00:15:51.464 --> 00:15:53.960\nI can see it really big, I like that.\n\n270\n00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.448\nI can scroll down to see the other\npreview, or the other options,\n\n271\n00:15:57.448 --> 00:15:58.852\nsorry, the other files.\n\n272\n00:15:58.852 --> 00:16:03.492\nThat I have been sent,\nI can click on them, see the preview and\n\n273\n00:16:03.492 --> 00:16:07.610\nespecially if it is an Office\nfile such as PowerPoint.\n\n274\n00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:11.276\nIt actually puts me into almost\nlike a baby PowerPoint in\n\n275\n00:16:11.276 --> 00:16:16.490\nthe sense that I could start editing\nthe slide show, I could edit and reply.\n\n276\n00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:20.910\nThe collaboration that's where Microsoft\nhas really started to really excel,\n\n277\n00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.320\nI know you really like\nthat pun right there?\n\n278\n00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:28.158\nAnd how it works with its Office\nproducts together online in this cloud\n\n279\n00:16:28.158 --> 00:16:30.440\ncollaborative environment.\n\n280\n00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.131\nSo you have the email, and\nyou've got the PowerPoint right here and\n\n281\n00:16:34.131 --> 00:16:37.260\nI can do all the different things\nthat I want to do with it.\n\n282\n00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.070\nDown below my head there\nare some other options here.\n\n283\n00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:44.992\nOnce I'm in preview if I wanted to\nbring them all down at one time,\n\n284\n00:16:44.992 --> 00:16:50.560\nit gives me the option to download all or\nI could save them all to OneDrive.\n\n285\n00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.386\nSo, coming into this preview window and\nseeing the different options\n\n286\n00:16:55.386 --> 00:17:00.210\nthat you have, it's kinda cool and\nI like the functionality that this\n\n287\n00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:04.700\noutlook on the web gives us\nwhen working with attachments.\n\n288\n00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:08.697\nNow if I want to get out of this preview\nmode we've got that little x we're always\n\n289\n00:17:08.697 --> 00:17:11.400\nlooking for that x gonna close it and\nreturn to email.\n\n290\n00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.020\nAnd even so I was pretty quick with those\nHover to Discover always remember those\n\n291\n00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.010\nHover to Discovers.\n\n292\n00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.520\nIf you're a little scared\nlike what does that do?\n\n293\n00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.960\nJust hover, see what it does.\n\n294\n00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.690\nAnd hopefully it will give you enough of\na description to tell you what it will do.\n\n295\n00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:27.456\nNow all those same buttons\nare right here in this window.\n\n296\n00:17:27.456 --> 00:17:31.940\nYou don't have to go into preview\nto get into the download all or\n\n297\n00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:36.940\nto save them all to your OneDrive account,\nthey're all in there.\n\n298\n00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.831\nAnd of course you do have the fun,\ndrag and\n\n299\n00:17:39.831 --> 00:17:45.202\ndrop of taking the learned PowerPoint,\ndragging it out on to your desktop and\n\n300\n00:17:45.202 --> 00:17:48.690\nthen of course it didn't do that for\nme this time.\n\n301\n00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:51.704\nThat's okay, we can always go ahead and\ndownload it and\n\n302\n00:17:51.704 --> 00:17:53.780\nmake sure that it gets out onto there.\n\n303\n00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.500\nPutting it into the email,\nthat always works.\n\n304\n00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.990\nMaybe dragging it out.\n\n305\n00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.240\nI don't know if it's the browser,\nbut it's not working.\n\n306\n00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.930\nBut if it doesn't work for you,\nyou always have the options.\n\n307\n00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.560\nAnd if it works, hey, that's awesome.\n\n308\n00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.470\nLet's go ahead and maximize this back up.\n\n309\n00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:10.880\nMoving on to the Like button.\n\n310\n00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.468\nAnd Justin,\nthis is kind of your thing isn't it?\n\n311\n00:18:15.468 --> 00:18:19.111\n&gt;&gt; You're right Vonne, I've actually been\ndoing that off camera this whole time and\n\n312\n00:18:19.111 --> 00:18:20.010\nyou caught me.\n\n313\n00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:20.635\nYou caught me.\n\n314\n00:18:20.635 --> 00:18:21.185\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n315\n00:18:21.185 --> 00:18:25.980\nI have played around with the like\nbutton within our email clients at work.\n\n316\n00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.898\nAnd I don't think I know all about it but\n\n317\n00:18:27.898 --> 00:18:30.234\nI'm sure you're here to illuminate it for\nme.\n\n318\n00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:34.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah and it's one of\nthose like, why are we doing this?\n\n319\n00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.931\nI like this and if anybody, if you wanna\ntemper to DevProTV you can see Justin's\n\n320\n00:18:38.931 --> 00:18:42.980\nevery single email or every single\nthumbnail of the video as, and\n\n321\n00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.820\nit's pretty awesome,\nit's kinda like his signature move.\n\n322\n00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:50.897\nSo I'm actually very glad, that you\nare hosting with us on this wonderful\n\n323\n00:18:50.897 --> 00:18:53.280\nepisode about the like button and emails.\n\n324\n00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.750\nSo, this is right over here.\n\n325\n00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:56.730\nDo you see right there?\n\n326\n00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:00.775\nAnd this one has already been liked,\nI liked this,\n\n327\n00:19:00.775 --> 00:19:04.130\nI thought this was a fun email.\n\n328\n00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:05.370\nWhat does it mean?\n\n329\n00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.620\nIt's kinda like why do I flag anything?\n\n330\n00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.600\nWhy do I catalog or categorize anything?\n\n331\n00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:17.000\nAnd why do we like people's pictures in\nFacebook or on Instagram and social media?\n\n332\n00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.030\nBecause you go back and look,\nis like how many likes did I get?\n\n333\n00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.000\nHow many people like my email?\n\n334\n00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.647\nWell that's a way that we can communicate\nwith each other by not even having to\n\n335\n00:19:26.647 --> 00:19:27.610\nrespond.\n\n336\n00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:31.538\nIf I click the like button\non this email from Justin,\n\n337\n00:19:31.538 --> 00:19:36.110\nwhat Justin is going to get is\nhe's gonna get a little bling.\n\n338\n00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:41.028\nHe's gonna get like a little notification\njust like you have in social media,\n\n339\n00:19:41.028 --> 00:19:43.250\nto say, hey Joey like my email.\n\n340\n00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:48.970\nThis is, that would be Justin talking to\nhimself or well I'm Justin right now.\n\n341\n00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:49.930\nBut you're Justin.\n\n342\n00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.521\n&gt;&gt; There's that identity crisis again.\n\n343\n00:19:51.521 --> 00:19:53.684\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be a problem.\n\n344\n00:19:53.684 --> 00:19:55.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure but\n\n345\n00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.914\nwe'll try to manage,\nwe'll try to manage back to liking things.\n\n346\n00:19:58.914 --> 00:20:03.223\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, so it's just\na notification of I likes the email and\n\n347\n00:20:03.223 --> 00:20:04.290\nthat's great.\n\n348\n00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:08.550\nSo what can I see,\ndid somebody else like my email?\n\n349\n00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:12.660\nAnd it does pop-up right\nhere in your notifications.\n\n350\n00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.490\nAnd in real time,\nlike let's see if I, you know what?\n\n351\n00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.680\nLet's do it really quickly\nbefore I go back into here.\n\n352\n00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.680\nLet's switch over to JT.\n\n353\n00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:24.710\nAnd I have an email from Joey to JT.\n\n354\n00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:29.372\nAnd let's say, and I just double-clicked\nit, because I'm so in that loop right now,\n\n355\n00:20:29.372 --> 00:20:32.020\nI'm in a loop,\nI'm in a horrible loop right now.\n\n356\n00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.590\nBut I don't want you to think\nthat double-clicking is horrible.\n\n357\n00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:38.520\nThe only reason it's horrible for me,\njust to clarify, it takes so long.\n\n358\n00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:43.020\nIf it was so quick I probably wouldn't\neven be noticing any of this.\n\n359\n00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.700\nBut the like button is right here,\nI'm gonna click it.\n\n360\n00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:49.030\nSo yep, good job, liked it.\n\n361\n00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:53.220\nClose this, it's jam packed over to Joey,\nthere it is.\n\n362\n00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:58.046\nYou see that, I have a little 1 under\nthe bell or on top of the bell and\n\n363\n00:20:58.046 --> 00:20:59.160\nme as Joey now.\n\n364\n00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:07.130\nAnd I click it, look, Justin Timberlake\nlike my email message, that's awesome.\n\n365\n00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:13.550\nI know without him even responding,\nthat he's good to go, he liked it.\n\n366\n00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:16.168\nAnd the show more in the notifications,\n\n367\n00:21:16.168 --> 00:21:21.020\nwell what other things did,\nJustin liked a couple other of my emails.\n\n368\n00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.310\nCool I like that, I like that.\n\n369\n00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.950\nI can send it back to him and\nwe could just sit there and\n\n370\n00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.670\njust click the like button all day long\nand just know that we're all good.\n\n371\n00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:35.324\nNow, before any of you all get super\nexcited about this, I do wanna\n\n372\n00:21:35.324 --> 00:21:40.314\nmention that at the time of this\nrecording the like is only available for\n\n373\n00:21:40.314 --> 00:21:43.260\ncommercial subscriptions.\n\n374\n00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.329\nNow, with that word\ncommercial subscriptions,\n\n375\n00:21:46.329 --> 00:21:50.859\nthis is what I'm inferring from that\nstatement that maybe a Office 365\n\n376\n00:21:50.859 --> 00:21:54.312\npersonal account might not\nhave the like ones on there.\n\n377\n00:21:54.312 --> 00:21:58.027\nI meant this might be at an Enterprise\nlevel, or in a Business Plus or\n\n378\n00:21:58.027 --> 00:22:00.980\nBusiness Pro Plus,\nwhich is a type of account I have.\n\n379\n00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.888\nI think I'll share on an E level two, so\n\n380\n00:22:03.888 --> 00:22:07.690\nif you don't have this\nfunctionality it's okay.\n\n381\n00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:11.860\nIt's not available for\neverybody out there or at Outlook.com.\n\n382\n00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:19.110\nSo just keep a note of the specifications\non whether or not you have likes or not.\n\n383\n00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:22.730\nNow last part of our basic emails.\n\n384\n00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:26.819\nWe've done all sorts of\ndifferent things about sending,\n\n385\n00:22:26.819 --> 00:22:30.750\nreceiving, forwarding, bcc,\ncc where are we going?\n\n386\n00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.780\nI like it and then sometimes I don't like\nit, I want to throw it in the trash.\n\n387\n00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:39.804\nSo we have out deleted items things\nthat come in that I don't need anymore,\n\n388\n00:22:39.804 --> 00:22:43.330\nmaybe like this undeliverable\nwith a single click.\n\n389\n00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:48.210\nI don't want this anymore,\nI don't want this in my inbox anymore.\n\n390\n00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.560\nYou can click the Delete\nbutton at the top.\n\n391\n00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.840\nWe also talked about\ngoing back to our inbox.\n\n392\n00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.433\nI will close this, because sometimes\nwhen you've opened one and\n\n393\n00:22:57.433 --> 00:23:00.580\nyou do something like delete it,\nit goes to the next one.\n\n394\n00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.590\nSo come back into your main list here.\n\n395\n00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:08.613\nYou have you're hovering over so\nI can click the trash can here and\n\n396\n00:23:08.613 --> 00:23:11.770\ndelete my other messages,\ncuz I don't need them.\n\n397\n00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:15.802\nBut it's just like throwing a piece of\npaper into a trash can in your house\n\n398\n00:23:15.802 --> 00:23:18.578\nis that it's still on that\ntrash can over there and\n\n399\n00:23:18.578 --> 00:23:23.470\nuntil I actually take it out to the curb\nand it gets picked up by the dump truck.\n\n400\n00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:26.580\nI could still go in and\nclean off the coffee grinds, and\n\n401\n00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:30.908\nall the other stuff that's on there, and\nbe able to get that piece of paper or\n\n402\n00:23:30.908 --> 00:23:34.040\nthat receipt that I need to\nhave to return those shoes.\n\n403\n00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:38.360\nYes, this just happened to me last week,\nso [LAUGH] this is what happens.\n\n404\n00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.590\nAnything that goes into your deleted\nitems, come over here to the left.\n\n405\n00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.600\nIt's hanging out in that trash can.\n\n406\n00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.397\nSo if I ever need to be like,\n\n407\n00:23:47.397 --> 00:23:51.317\noops, I really need to have\nthat PowerPoint message back.\n\n408\n00:23:51.317 --> 00:23:55.530\nI need to make,\nhave it come back into my place.\n\n409\n00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:57.910\nNotice I single-clicked it to open it.\n\n410\n00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:00.569\nYou can recover this email.\n\n411\n00:24:00.569 --> 00:24:05.560\nI wanna bring it back out of\nthe trash can, then close this here.\n\n412\n00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.450\nYou should also be able to without\neven opening it or single or\n\n413\n00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:12.620\ndouble clicking it,\nyou can click the recover there as well.\n\n414\n00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.230\nIf you did, you also have the drag and\ndrop method.\n\n415\n00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:21.431\nI wanna take this email and put it\ninto my inbox or put it into any other\n\n416\n00:24:21.431 --> 00:24:26.096\nof the folders that I have designated\nto drag and drop method works as well.\n\n417\n00:24:26.096 --> 00:24:30.744\nDragging it over notice right there,\nputting it into the inbox and\n\n418\n00:24:30.744 --> 00:24:36.150\nit's moved out of the deleted items\nfolder, and went into the other places.\n\n419\n00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:41.330\nSo recovery is good, but I really\nwanna get rid of all those emails.\n\n420\n00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:42.610\nThey need to go away.\n\n421\n00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:47.740\nI want to delete the trash can or\nremove everything.\n\n422\n00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:48.987\nYou could do it a couple different ways.\n\n423\n00:24:48.987 --> 00:24:53.977\nI'm going to show you this one, by\nright-clicking on the deleted items, and\n\n424\n00:24:53.977 --> 00:24:57.770\nin the deleted items folder,\nyou want to say delete all.\n\n425\n00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:02.730\nOnce I click delete all, and I'm going\nto do it, are you sure you want to\n\n426\n00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:07.860\npermanently delete the items and\nsub folders in the deleted items?\n\n427\n00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:15.630\nOnce you click Ok, you should think that\nthis are gone, they are gone, gone, gone.\n\n428\n00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.300\nAlways is a good rule of thumb,\ncould you retrieve them?\n\n429\n00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.890\nYou might need some help from IT, and\n\n430\n00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:28.140\nI would probably say,\njust think they are really, really gone.\n\n431\n00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:32.710\nIt is possible, we could go into a whole\nnother thing about data recovery, and\n\n432\n00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:33.250\nthings like that.\n\n433\n00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:38.645\nBut for an end user,\nyou need to make sure that you're done.\n\n434\n00:25:38.645 --> 00:25:42.540\nSo, there is one point that I wanna\nmake before we completely exit.\n\n435\n00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.090\nIt does have to kinda\ngo along with exiting.\n\n436\n00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:51.100\nMaybe every time that I close my browser\ndown and I exit out of my account,\n\n437\n00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:56.840\nI want everything that's in the deleted\nitem folder to be actually deleted gone.\n\n438\n00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.460\nSo there is a setting, and I wrote it\ndown this time Justin, so in [LAUGH]\n\n439\n00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:05.420\nthe settings, if we go down, behind my\nhead, there is the app settings for\n\n440\n00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:11.800\nmail and\nin mail we have our message options.\n\n441\n00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:16.344\nSo let's find, there it is,\nMessage options the check box for\n\n442\n00:26:16.344 --> 00:26:19.795\nempty the deleted items\nfolder when I sign out.\n\n443\n00:26:19.795 --> 00:26:25.068\nIt will do exactly that, it tweet to\nsound if you wanna make sure it goes away\n\n444\n00:26:25.068 --> 00:26:30.606\nespecially if you have a very limited\nmailbox size, you might want to do that.\n\n445\n00:26:30.606 --> 00:26:34.421\nBut at least I wanted to point that out so\nyou know where that option is and\n\n446\n00:26:34.421 --> 00:26:37.850\nyou can get rid of all\nthe things you don't want to.\n\n447\n00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:41.010\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne, I definitely don't wanna\nget rid of this information, right?\n\n448\n00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.710\nIn these past three episodes\nyou have taken us from on\n\n449\n00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:46.380\nemail apprentice all the way\nto an email magician.\n\n450\n00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.570\nSo thank you for that.\n\n451\n00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:51.510\nBut we are not done with Outlook on the\nWeb, so you should definitely join us for\n\n452\n00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:53.730\nmore episodes on Outlook on the Web.\n\n453\n00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:55.374\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for OfficeProTV.\n\n454\n00:26:55.374 --> 00:26:57.380\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n455\n00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:58.220\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n456\n00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:05.030\nWe'll see you next time.\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

message bodies.\n\n5\n00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.845\nWe need to add a little pizzazz,\na little something extra, right?\n\n6\n00:00:18.845 --> 00:00:21.070\n[FOREIGN] to our messages, and\n\n7\n00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.310\nhere to help us is our very own\nOutlook oracle Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.230\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.171\n&gt;&gt; Wow, Outlook oracle, I sound so fancy.\n\n10\n00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:30.841\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, it is meant to be fancy.\n\n11\n00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:35.374\nYou are the all-seeing,\nthe all-knowing in the land of Outlook.\n\n12\n00:00:35.374 --> 00:00:36.740\n&gt;&gt; I love this.\n\n13\n00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.613\n[LAUGH] Well, we are going to add\na little bit of extra pizzazz,\n\n14\n00:00:41.613 --> 00:00:44.910\nyeah, I said it right, to our messages.\n\n15\n00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.950\nWe're gonna make stuff maybe some pink and\nsome purple.\n\n16\n00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.063\nSee some fonts here and\n\n17\n00:00:49.063 --> 00:00:51.934\nthere, and I really get into\nadding some extra elements,\n\n18\n00:00:51.934 --> 00:00:56.054\nlike, maybe a table, maybe we'll throw\nin an image there, and some hyperlinks.\n\n19\n00:00:56.054 --> 00:01:00.215\nAnd all the different things that we could\ndo in our message body to go ahead and\n\n20\n00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:01.248\nadd that content.\n\n21\n00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:05.080\nSo I have got Justin's,\nno actually, no, we're doing Joey.\n\n22\n00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.980\nI have Joey's computer ready, and\nin the spirit of formatting messages,\n\n23\n00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.470\nI went ahead and mixed it up a little bit.\n\n24\n00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.848\nI threw a new theme on my interface,\n\n25\n00:01:13.848 --> 00:01:17.188\njust cuz I just wanted\na little bit of difference.\n\n26\n00:01:17.188 --> 00:01:21.268\nThat's the nice thing, is you can go ahead\nand customize what your feeling, maybe,\n\n27\n00:01:21.268 --> 00:01:21.787\nthat day.\n\n28\n00:01:21.787 --> 00:01:23.064\nEven though it was blue,\nI'm not feeling blue.\n\n29\n00:01:23.064 --> 00:01:25.845\nI'm actually feeling pretty\ngood about everything, but\n\n30\n00:01:25.845 --> 00:01:27.271\nI thought it was very techie.\n\n31\n00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:30.808\nAnd very ITProTV, OfficeProTV, DevProTV,\n\n32\n00:01:30.808 --> 00:01:36.812\nall of those wonderful TVs that we have,\nso I went ahead through that on there.\n\n33\n00:01:36.812 --> 00:01:38.640\nAll right, so where are we gonna start?\n\n34\n00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.154\nWell we gotta go ahead and create a new\nmessage before we start adding in\n\n35\n00:01:43.154 --> 00:01:45.382\nthe content to an actual message.\n\n36\n00:01:45.382 --> 00:01:50.230\nAnd for this one, I am gonna go ahead and\npop this out into its own window just to\n\n37\n00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.869\ngive us a little extra room and be able\nto kinda just focus on this message.\n\n38\n00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.452\nNow, when we go ahead and\nget started with adding in our content,\n\n39\n00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:05.157\ncuz we did our basic mail episodes where\nwe just typed a couple little lines,\n\n40\n00:02:05.157 --> 00:02:09.240\nbut you might need to add some\nheadings to your message.\n\n41\n00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.800\nMaybe you need to add\nan image in a table so,\n\n42\n00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.870\nsome different options\nthat you're gonna have.\n\n43\n00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.570\nBut before we get started,\nI do wanna make a point that,\n\n44\n00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.370\nusing Outlook on the web,\nwhether it's outlook.com or\n\n45\n00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.270\nthe Office 365 version,\nyou have a lot less options for\n\n46\n00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.270\nadding content or\nformatting content in your messages than\n\n47\n00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.189\nyou do if you are on a desktop\nversion of Outlook 2016.\n\n48\n00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.874\nSo coming from a place where I\ncan do all of these things that I\n\n49\n00:02:42.874 --> 00:02:45.988\nhave insert tab and I have a review tab.\n\n50\n00:02:45.988 --> 00:02:49.477\nAnd all of these different things\nwhen I'm composing a message,\n\n51\n00:02:49.477 --> 00:02:51.530\nlike I'd be working in Word.\n\n52\n00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.980\nLike on my local version of Outlook 2016,\nyou don't have as many things here.\n\n53\n00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.540\nSo it could be a good thing and\na bad thing.\n\n54\n00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.430\nSometimes it's like,\nI don't need all of those extra features.\n\n55\n00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.770\nI really just need to get in some\nstuff from this basic content.\n\n56\n00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.775\nAnd so the Outlook on the web version\nmight be like just what you need,\n\n57\n00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:13.640\ncuz it just gives you,\nwell, just what you need.\n\n58\n00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.375\nWe can address this, that's fine.\n\n59\n00:03:16.375 --> 00:03:20.700\nWe'll address it to JT and\nwe will say format.\n\n60\n00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.310\nAnd I am going down into my message body.\n\n61\n00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.597\nWhen we start composing messages,\n\n62\n00:03:27.597 --> 00:03:32.743\nyou have two options of how\nyour content is formatted and\n\n63\n00:03:32.743 --> 00:03:36.680\nthat is in either HTML or plain text.\n\n64\n00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.830\nNow HTML, what does that stand for?\n\n65\n00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.090\nThat's Hyper Text Markup Language.\n\n66\n00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.650\nIt is the language of the web.\n\n67\n00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.530\nIt's all about a series of tags and\nattributes and,\n\n68\n00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.760\nif you have no idea what I am\ntalking about, don't worry about it.\n\n69\n00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.344\nYou can just think that it's the format\nthat allowed you to do all of\n\n70\n00:03:52.344 --> 00:03:56.568\nthe different types of formatting like\ncharacter and paragraph formatting,\n\n71\n00:03:56.568 --> 00:03:59.324\nwhich we'll talk a little\nbit more about in detail.\n\n72\n00:03:59.324 --> 00:04:02.930\nThings like adding tables,\nadding images cuz that language and\n\n73\n00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.609\nthat format supports\nthose types of elements.\n\n74\n00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.110\nPlain text is exactly what it's sounds.\n\n75\n00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.320\nIt's just text, you can't add color,\nyou can't add font.\n\n76\n00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.931\nYou can't left indent or\nright indent, or write align or\n\n77\n00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:20.330\nleft align any of your text,\nit's just text as text.\n\n78\n00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:26.030\nAnd it's something to consider when you're\nsending out messages because not all, I'm\n\n79\n00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.730\ngonna sound a little dated right here, not\nall email servers allows HTML formatting.\n\n80\n00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.910\nNow as soon as I say that and that\ncomes out of my mouth, in this day and\n\n81\n00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.820\nage, I don't know if that's\nstill true honestly [LAUGH].\n\n82\n00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.510\n&gt;&gt; Well I can jump in here Vonne.\n\n83\n00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.630\nI know that HTML emails are actually\nlimited to a subset of HTML.\n\n84\n00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.860\nNow this is a little beyond the technical\nspec, so there are still some limitations.\n\n85\n00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.070\nBut also, it's kind of nice if you know\nthat someone's gonna have reduced Internet\n\n86\n00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.890\navailability and\nmaybe using those light versions.\n\n87\n00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.420\nIf you get plain text, well,\nall you're gonna see is plain text.\n\n88\n00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.190\nIf you get the HTML version, well,\nit may not render the HTML but\n\n89\n00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.420\ninstead give you the HTML representation\nwhich, behind the scenes, is still text.\n\n90\n00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.550\nSo you've got text in text and it's gonna\nbe a little harder to read if, well,\n\n91\n00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.826\nthey're using some kind of client that\nhas, well, HTML rendering turned off.\n\n92\n00:05:16.826 --> 00:05:21.430\nAnd there may be entities such as\ngovernment or corporate entities,\n\n93\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.340\nthat will still use those\njust to reduce bandwidth and\n\n94\n00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.770\nmaintenance or a Legacy system.\n\n95\n00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so it might not be\nnecessary that they can't support HTML.\n\n96\n00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.240\nYes, definitely the connections and\nthe different things that you need,\n\n97\n00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.500\nI don't need all of that bandwidth, so\nI wanna go ahead and condense it down.\n\n98\n00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.380\nSo that's a great example of why\nyou might wanna go ahead and\n\n99\n00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.540\nuse plain text rather\nthan HTML formatting.\n\n100\n00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.773\nSo the message bar that I have right now,\n\n101\n00:05:49.773 --> 00:05:52.937\nI know right now that this\nmessage is formatted as a HTML.\n\n102\n00:05:52.937 --> 00:05:57.907\nThe reason I know that is all of\nthese buttons down across the bottom\n\n103\n00:05:57.907 --> 00:06:00.020\nof this message area.\n\n104\n00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.191\nSo all these buttons allow me to do\nthings, and if I hover to discover,\n\n105\n00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:07.745\nchange the font, change the font size,\nmake things bold.\n\n106\n00:06:07.745 --> 00:06:10.620\nGo ahead and change the font color.\n\n107\n00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.973\nSo making sure you know what each\none of these icons does within\n\n108\n00:06:14.973 --> 00:06:19.277\nyour formatting is really nice\nwith that hover to discover.\n\n109\n00:06:19.277 --> 00:06:22.339\nNow if you don't see this\nbar across the bottom,\n\n110\n00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:26.995\nit could be that you don't actually\nsee the formatting options.\n\n111\n00:06:26.995 --> 00:06:30.502\nDown here on the bottom, after the right\nhand side of all of our send and\n\n112\n00:06:30.502 --> 00:06:33.015\ndiscard buttons,\nthere's a little carrot looking button.\n\n113\n00:06:33.015 --> 00:06:34.077\nThe more actions and\n\n114\n00:06:34.077 --> 00:06:38.150\nyou could see that it's giving me some\ninformation right here for me to show.\n\n115\n00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.798\nAnd if it didn't show all the options, you\nmight not see like formatting options and\n\n116\n00:06:42.798 --> 00:06:46.007\nit will tell you,\nlike show these formatting options, or\n\n117\n00:06:46.007 --> 00:06:50.021\na lot times it will be off to the side,\nover here on the right-hand side.\n\n118\n00:06:50.021 --> 00:06:54.884\nBut talking about that HTML in plain text,\nthe option to switch\n\n119\n00:06:54.884 --> 00:07:00.230\nit into plain text is in that\nActions button down at the bottom.\n\n120\n00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.620\nAnd if I switch it over to plain text,\nit's giving me a warning right here to say\n\n121\n00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.450\nthat, hey if you'd already started\ntyping things in and you had formats and\n\n122\n00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.540\nyou had things that we're\nusing an HTML formatting,\n\n123\n00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.360\nyou're gonna lose some of that,\nmaybe not all of it but most of it.\n\n124\n00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.522\nSince we don't have anything\nto start with, that's fine,\n\n125\n00:07:18.522 --> 00:07:22.804\nI'll click OK and notice that all the\nbuttons across the bottom, they're gone.\n\n126\n00:07:22.804 --> 00:07:26.758\nI don't have anything to make it\na font color, or a font size, or\n\n127\n00:07:26.758 --> 00:07:28.710\naligning it differently.\n\n128\n00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.628\nSo those options get taken away.\n\n129\n00:07:30.628 --> 00:07:35.665\nAnd this could come into play to when\nyou're responding to somebody in a plain,\n\n130\n00:07:35.665 --> 00:07:38.210\nthey sent it to you in plain text.\n\n131\n00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:43.290\nIt might default to go ahead and\nformat in plain text when you respond.\n\n132\n00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.250\nAnd you're like, what's going on here?\n\n133\n00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.897\nSo that might be why you don't\nhave as many of those options.\n\n134\n00:07:48.897 --> 00:07:53.221\nNow if I'm in plain text,\nI wanna go back to HTML, you can do that.\n\n135\n00:07:53.221 --> 00:07:56.716\nYou can click on that and\nswitch this over to HTML and\n\n136\n00:07:56.716 --> 00:07:59.572\nthen it gives you all the buttons across.\n\n137\n00:07:59.572 --> 00:08:03.130\nBut be mindful like just I was\nsaying you might go ahead and\n\n138\n00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:07.875\ncreate in the message in HTML and all\nthese fancy formattings, and send it to\n\n139\n00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:12.644\nsomebody that is only allowing their\nmessages to be received in plain text.\n\n140\n00:08:12.644 --> 00:08:16.650\nThey might not see it\nthe same way that you intend.\n\n141\n00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:21.680\nSo it's more of just being aware\nof the different formattings, and\n\n142\n00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.800\nwhat it can and cannot do, and\njust knowing that it is available.\n\n143\n00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.950\nI will give one side note that if you're\nused to Outlook on your desktop version,\n\n144\n00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:35.030\nOutlook 2016, there is a third\ntype of format; it's called RTF,\n\n145\n00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.370\nwhich is Rich Text Formatting.\n\n146\n00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.030\nIt's kinda like in between.\n\n147\n00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.810\nIt's not all the full function\ncapabilities of an HTML formatting.\n\n148\n00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:44.150\nBut it's just not plain text.\n\n149\n00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:48.780\nYou can get some formatting, you can\nchange like I think it accepts colors,\n\n150\n00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.060\nI think maybe like bold and italic.\n\n151\n00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:55.190\nThose kinds of basic formattings but\nnot the extent to HTML.\n\n152\n00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:56.430\nThere is no in between.\n\n153\n00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.717\nThere is no RTF formatting within\nyour Outlook on the web, so\n\n154\n00:09:00.717 --> 00:09:02.995\nI just wanted to throw that out.\n\n155\n00:09:02.995 --> 00:09:06.247\nThe other thing,\nas we start to get into one,\n\n156\n00:09:06.247 --> 00:09:11.383\nadding text into our message body and\nthen formatting it, you will also\n\n157\n00:09:11.383 --> 00:09:16.840\nhave some differences in some\nvariations depending on your browsers.\n\n158\n00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:22.360\nBecause when we're inputting,\nI try to say,\n\n159\n00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.215\ninserting and inputting at the same time,\nthat kinda weird thing going on there.\n\n160\n00:09:26.215 --> 00:09:31.070\nWhen I'm putting text into this text area,\nthis is all in the web.\n\n161\n00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:35.000\nSo if we're on the web, there is some\ntype of HTMLing, if you wanna say,\n\n162\n00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.430\ngoing on here, and\nhow your browsers interpret or\n\n163\n00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.930\nrender as it's called, what's going\non in these different interfaces.\n\n164\n00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.309\nThere will be some variations.\n\n165\n00:09:44.309 --> 00:09:47.306\nAnd I actually I have JT over here, and\n\n166\n00:09:47.306 --> 00:09:51.860\nI have him setup with his mail and\nhe's in Chrome.\n\n167\n00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:56.625\nSo I wanted to give you just a few\nexamples while we're doing this of\n\n168\n00:09:56.625 --> 00:10:01.477\nthe differences of me using Edge\nas my browser versus using Google,\n\n169\n00:10:01.477 --> 00:10:05.663\nthe Chrome browser, for\nputting some of these things in.\n\n170\n00:10:05.663 --> 00:10:08.300\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nput him up over here.\n\n171\n00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.720\nAnd actually right behind my head, I just\nwanted to give you a quick notice that\n\n172\n00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.270\nnotice that I'm in the reading pane area.\n\n173\n00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.100\nI'm composing my message here.\n\n174\n00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.050\nI don't have as many options.\n\n175\n00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:22.402\nSo the More button over there is gonna\ngive me some of those other buttons that\n\n176\n00:10:22.402 --> 00:10:23.226\nare allowed.\n\n177\n00:10:23.226 --> 00:10:28.130\nAnd so you can see that you could still\nhave the plain text and everything there.\n\n178\n00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:31.290\nBut that's where in case you\ndon't see all of those buttons,\n\n179\n00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.440\nthat More button over there\nwill give you them as well.\n\n180\n00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.310\nAnd all of the formatting options\nthat we're gonna do are the same in\n\n181\n00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.110\nOutlook 365 and Outlook.com.\n\n182\n00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.350\nI think I already said that.\n\n183\n00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.680\nI'm just gonna say it again.\n\n184\n00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.298\nLet's switch back over to Joey.\n\n185\n00:10:44.298 --> 00:10:47.220\nI'm going to start typing and\nI'm using Edge.\n\n186\n00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:53.270\nThe thing that I wanna point out here is,\nsome of these auto-correct options,\n\n187\n00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:58.510\nthat if you are using a Microsoft browser\nsuch as Edge, it might help you along.\n\n188\n00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.754\nLet me give you an example.\n\n189\n00:11:00.754 --> 00:11:05.790\nIf I type in the word,\nI'm gonna say can I do the dishes?\n\n190\n00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.260\nCan I, yeah, can I do the dishes?\n\n191\n00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.423\nI don't really wanna do the dishes.\n\n192\n00:11:09.423 --> 00:11:11.860\nSo I usually pass that one off.\n\n193\n00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.040\n&gt;&gt; Who does want to do the dishes.\n\n194\n00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.477\nMy idea of doing the dishes is even\nif they're nice porcelain dishes,\n\n195\n00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:20.228\nwe should just throw them away and\nbuy new ones, right?\n\n196\n00:11:20.228 --> 00:11:21.357\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I will do them but\n\n197\n00:11:21.357 --> 00:11:22.928\nI'm gonna do it grudgingly.\n\n198\n00:11:22.928 --> 00:11:26.776\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly so, and either things\nI wanna get a task, I can assign you that\n\n199\n00:11:26.776 --> 00:11:29.737\ntask and then I guess I'll have\nto go buy some more dishes.\n\n200\n00:11:29.737 --> 00:11:37.063\nSo if I type in the word can,\nC-N-A and I hit the Space.\n\n201\n00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:41.905\nIf you notice that what that little trick\nthat I had, you have to really mentally\n\n202\n00:11:41.905 --> 00:11:46.020\nthink about type this in wrong,\nis that as soon as I spaced off that,\n\n203\n00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:50.790\nit switched that CNA to CAN,\nwell that was pretty cool, what is that?\n\n204\n00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:55.440\nThose are those auto correct features that\nall of your Microsoft Office products\n\n205\n00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.980\ndo for\nyou a lot like especially with Word,\n\n206\n00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.400\nall of those auto correct features I mean,\nI love them, they're fantastic.\n\n207\n00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.283\nAnd Edge is doing this for it.\n\n208\n00:12:03.283 --> 00:12:05.900\nIt's not Outlook necessarily.\n\n209\n00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.650\nIt's not Outlook on the web that's\ndoing it, it's the browser.\n\n210\n00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.417\nSo you do have that going on here.\n\n211\n00:12:10.417 --> 00:12:17.900\nI'm gonna say Ken,\nI do the HTE, there's that.\n\n212\n00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.466\nOnce I space off,\nit goes ahead and corrects it.\n\n213\n00:12:20.466 --> 00:12:24.147\nCan I do the dishes?\n\n214\n00:12:24.147 --> 00:12:27.350\nSee, it did all of that correction for me.\n\n215\n00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:31.470\nIf I type in the word like birthday\nwith an H and a T switched over,\n\n216\n00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:35.010\nor my favorite, the receive, right?\n\n217\n00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.370\nI before e except after c.\n\n218\n00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:41.400\nAnd I have to tell myself every\nsingle time I type that in.\n\n219\n00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.610\nWell, it will fix those types\nof commonly misspelled words.\n\n220\n00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:46.910\nAnd that's really great.\n\n221\n00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:52.520\nLet's jump over here to\nJT who's using Chrome.\n\n222\n00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.303\nIf I said C&amp;A, nope.\n\n223\n00:12:56.303 --> 00:13:02.381\nDo can I do HTE,\n\n224\n00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:05.190\nnope.\n\n225\n00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.341\nNo it doesn't like that.\n\n226\n00:13:07.341 --> 00:13:10.749\nSo it's not Outlook, it's the browser.\n\n227\n00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:15.663\nNow over here it is giving me, and\nlet's jump over here again and\n\n228\n00:13:15.663 --> 00:13:19.485\njust again,\nif I type in something really wrong,\n\n229\n00:13:19.485 --> 00:13:23.131\nthat's not wrong [LAUGH]\nif I type in something.\n\n230\n00:13:23.131 --> 00:13:27.536\n&gt;&gt; You actually did spell it wrong and\nthen it quickly corrected that.\n\n231\n00:13:27.536 --> 00:13:29.580\n&gt;&gt; You saw that.\n\n232\n00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.313\n&gt;&gt; These little transpositions\nare common spelling error.\n\n233\n00:13:32.313 --> 00:13:36.720\nWe'll, you'll notice, if you look back\na few episodes, it says right there.\n\n234\n00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.330\nOutlook for the web is optimized and\nrecommended to be used with edge.\n\n235\n00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.320\nAnd you're seeing some of those\nfeatures that kind of come forth.\n\n236\n00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.640\nI will tell you this.\n\n237\n00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.310\nSometimes this can be annoying because\nif you work in the medical industry and\n\n238\n00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.630\nyou're talking about interviewing CNAs,\n\n239\n00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.970\nwell it's always gonna\nautocomplete the can.\n\n240\n00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:56.000\nAnd maybe that's a good time\nto switch to Chrome just\n\n241\n00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.380\nto alleviate if you're using\nabbreviations and things like that.\n\n242\n00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.520\nSo it's one of those nuance things that\nsometimes drives you crazy depending on\n\n243\n00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.586\nwhat you need to do.\n\n244\n00:14:03.586 --> 00:14:05.692\n&gt;&gt; Now, as soon as you just said that,\n\n245\n00:14:05.692 --> 00:14:10.270\nI wanted to pick that up because I was\nactually gonna use that exact example.\n\n246\n00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.855\nAre you reading my mind over here?\n\n247\n00:14:11.855 --> 00:14:14.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am all in your mind or\n\n248\n00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.210\nmaybe you're in mine?\n\n249\n00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:15.990\nYou're the Oracle.\n\n250\n00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.875\nWho knows?\n\n251\n00:14:16.875 --> 00:14:20.586\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nmm [LAUGH] my special powers.\n\n252\n00:14:20.586 --> 00:14:25.899\nSo yes, exactly, if I am working with CNAs\nand I want it to stop recognizing that,\n\n253\n00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:30.520\nthese auto-correct features that\nare the mechanical intelligence,\n\n254\n00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.480\nthe, what did you?\n\n255\n00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.772\n&gt;&gt; Assistive technologies.\n\n256\n00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:36.086\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there we go.\n\n257\n00:14:36.086 --> 00:14:38.780\nWow, I'm gonna just pretend\nthat I just said that.\n\n258\n00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:42.910\nIt's telling us and helping us,\nbut you can have it don't do that.\n\n259\n00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:47.720\nSo if I right clicked on that word that\nit corrected for me, I could tell it hey,\n\n260\n00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.100\ndon't do that anymore.\n\n261\n00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.180\nSame with the HTE.\n\n262\n00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:51.770\nI could do that.\n\n263\n00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.310\nAnd the nice thing here is,\nhey, I misspelled birthday,\n\n264\n00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:57.110\nthose red squiggly lines that, hopefully,\n\n265\n00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.480\nif you've been using Microsoft products\nyou've maybe seen this before.\n\n266\n00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.560\nSpelling mistakes.\n\n267\n00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.250\nI didn't spell this right.\n\n268\n00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.060\nWell if I right-click on it, nice.\n\n269\n00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:11.570\nI spelled it enough to the word that it\nrecognize that I wanted to say birthday or\n\n270\n00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.670\nI could be breathy.\n\n271\n00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.150\nEither one of this I would spell it so\n\n272\n00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.990\nwrong sometimes that it's like I\ncan't give you any suggestions.\n\n273\n00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.527\nI have no idea what you're talking about,\nwhich happens a lot.\n\n274\n00:15:21.527 --> 00:15:26.628\nBut you can see that it's giving me some\nof those options for me to correct it.\n\n275\n00:15:26.628 --> 00:15:30.820\nNow let's jump back over here to Chrome\nand if I wanted to say do the dishes,\n\n276\n00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:35.400\nlook at the options that when\nright clicking in Chrome gives me.\n\n277\n00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.302\nI have a couple other things cuz\nnow it's like search Google for\n\n278\n00:15:38.302 --> 00:15:39.407\nthat particular word.\n\n279\n00:15:39.407 --> 00:15:42.008\nAdd to the dictionary and\nthen it goes ahead and\n\n280\n00:15:42.008 --> 00:15:44.730\ngives me that spelling correction as well.\n\n281\n00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:49.934\nSo browser specific for\nall this type of auto correcting.\n\n282\n00:15:49.934 --> 00:15:54.934\nHow it's going to format and what I\nmean by format when we start copying and\n\n283\n00:15:54.934 --> 00:15:58.332\npasting in a part two of\nthis format message body.\n\n284\n00:15:58.332 --> 00:16:02.742\nAll of these are going to have some\nvariation, so just be aware it.\n\n285\n00:16:02.742 --> 00:16:06.695\nAnd hopefully, if it's the browser\nthat you're most comfortable using,\n\n286\n00:16:06.695 --> 00:16:11.315\nyou might have already been familiar with\nsome of these things that it already does.\n\n287\n00:16:11.315 --> 00:16:13.525\nBecause that's why there's so\nmany different browsers.\n\n288\n00:16:13.525 --> 00:16:18.173\nIt's really kind of your personal\nchoice on which one you like the best.\n\n289\n00:16:18.173 --> 00:16:21.942\nAnd I won't get into that debate\nbecause it can get really heated,\n\n290\n00:16:21.942 --> 00:16:24.515\nespecially with some developers out there.\n\n291\n00:16:24.515 --> 00:16:28.416\nSo we have,\nback over here in Joey's account,\n\n292\n00:16:28.416 --> 00:16:33.400\nthe other thing really quickly,\nthere is no spell-check.\n\n293\n00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.207\nThis where I'm right-clicking and\nit is allowing me or\n\n294\n00:16:37.207 --> 00:16:40.040\ngiving me options to correct words.\n\n295\n00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.140\nI can't just do Check Spelling and\n\n296\n00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:47.260\nit goes through my entire message and\npicks out which ones are there.\n\n297\n00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.640\nSo make sure you proof read your emails.\n\n298\n00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:56.530\nI think I did the example of form and\nfrom, which very commonly happens to me.\n\n299\n00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.214\nSo double check everything, but\n\n300\n00:16:58.214 --> 00:17:02.070\nat least it gives you enough with\nthe right-clicking to allow it to do that.\n\n301\n00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:06.010\nAnd they may add to dictionary if you\nare gonna be using CNA all the time or\n\n302\n00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.072\nlike, Von.\n\n303\n00:17:07.072 --> 00:17:09.650\nI always gotta have that to every\ndictionary that I have to do,\n\n304\n00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.000\nso double check all of that.\n\n305\n00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.390\nSo automatic things that can happen.\n\n306\n00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:18.765\nNow, I'm going to close this window here,\n\n307\n00:17:18.765 --> 00:17:21.700\nbecause I just wanted to show\nyou the auto-corrections.\n\n308\n00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.130\nBut where is it going right now?\n\n309\n00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:25.030\nIt's going in my drafts\ncuz it's remembering,\n\n310\n00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.330\nthat's why it didn't say, hey,\ndo you wanna save your changes?\n\n311\n00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:28.560\nIt already did for me.\n\n312\n00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.560\nSo speaking of drafts, I'm gonna jump\nover here into my drafts folder.\n\n313\n00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:38.080\nBecause I have a message that I already\ncomposed a little while ago that\n\n314\n00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.710\nhas a lot of text already there for me.\n\n315\n00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:44.890\nSo I can do the formatting\ndemonstrations that I want,\n\n316\n00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.810\nand I will click it to pop\nit out into a new window.\n\n317\n00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:53.470\nWait because my computer takes a long\ntime for that double-clicking pop up.\n\n318\n00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.560\nWe know that pretty well, so\n[LAUGH] I have the text in here.\n\n319\n00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.260\nCharacter and paragraph formatting,\nI could talk for days about this.\n\n320\n00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.920\nLiterally days, but\nI'm gonna keep it very short for you.\n\n321\n00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.130\nCharacter level formatting is\nhow you want your text to look,\n\n322\n00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.220\nthings like font, size, color.\n\n323\n00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.670\nParagraph level formatting would be\nhow your paragraphs are formatted.\n\n324\n00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:20.040\nThose will be things like left aligned,\ncenter aligned, right aligned, bullets and\n\n325\n00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:24.530\nnumbering, and then your indents and\nparagraph spacing.\n\n326\n00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:30.737\nWe don't have spacing like line spacing\nand paragraph spacing in Outlook for Web.\n\n327\n00:18:30.737 --> 00:18:34.713\nBut it is part of that and it's just\nkind of like my daily, not daily,\n\n328\n00:18:34.713 --> 00:18:39.880\nit's just my routine when talking about\nthese different levels of formatting.\n\n329\n00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.560\nSo am I formatting things by hitting\nthe Enter key on my keyboard?\n\n330\n00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.810\nThat is a paragraph,\nanything that you hit Enter, even\n\n331\n00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:55.405\nif it's a couple of words long or\nmultiple long words long, wow.\n\n332\n00:18:55.405 --> 00:18:58.010\n[LAUGH] I don't know what that one\n\n333\n00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.570\nwas but-\n&gt;&gt; That was a lot of long words about long\n\n334\n00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.905\nwords, so who knows?\n\n335\n00:19:01.905 --> 00:19:03.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I have faith in you,\n\n336\n00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.730\nyou're gonna get it.\n\n337\n00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:06.345\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good, thank you.\n\n338\n00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:07.545\n[LAUGH] I am the oracle right now, right?\n\n339\n00:19:07.545 --> 00:19:08.797\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You are, you are.\n\n340\n00:19:08.797 --> 00:19:11.400\n&gt;&gt; So anytime you hit Enter it's\na paragraph, we'll just leave it at that.\n\n341\n00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:16.510\nSo how do I wanna change,\nsay Chapter 1 Down the Rabbit Hole?\n\n342\n00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.915\nThe first thing you need to do\nis you gotta select to affect.\n\n343\n00:19:19.915 --> 00:19:23.690\nYou've got to make sure you have\neverything selected that you want to\n\n344\n00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.340\nmake a change or affect.\n\n345\n00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:29.271\nSo click, hold, and drag,\njust drag your cursor across that and\n\n346\n00:19:29.271 --> 00:19:30.850\nmake sure I get that text.\n\n347\n00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:33.672\nBe careful about if you start\nselecting some text and\n\n348\n00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:35.580\nyou say, I didn't get it all.\n\n349\n00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.090\nSo let me click off of here,\nand that's another thing.\n\n350\n00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.430\nTo deselect your text,\nyou click off into some other place.\n\n351\n00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.995\nDoesn't matter if it's on a word or\nsomething else,\n\n352\n00:19:43.995 --> 00:19:46.048\njust stop having it selected, click off.\n\n353\n00:19:46.048 --> 00:19:50.340\nIf I click, hold, and drag here, and\nrealize, oops, I didn't get enough.\n\n354\n00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:55.550\nIf you start to drag over the selected\ntext and start moving it.\n\n355\n00:19:55.550 --> 00:20:01.638\nYou're not gonna get what you're trying to\ndo, you're not extending that selection.\n\n356\n00:20:01.638 --> 00:20:04.260\nYou're either deselecting or sometimes,\nespecially if you're on your desktop\n\n357\n00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.740\nversions, you're actually moving,\nyou're doing the drag and drop text.\n\n358\n00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:12.180\nNow, it's not doing the drag and drop text\nhere, but it's not doing what you want.\n\n359\n00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:16.220\nSo always, if you didn't do it right the\nfirst time, click off, and do it again.\n\n360\n00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.288\nSo, click, hold, and drag, getting that\ni-beam cursor over the text that I want.\n\n361\n00:20:20.288 --> 00:20:22.789\nNow something else that's happening here,\n\n362\n00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:26.290\nis that you get what's known as\nthis mini toolbar that pops up.\n\n363\n00:20:27.322 --> 00:20:30.750\nThis can be really handy\nbecause maybe you're way far\n\n364\n00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:35.170\ndown to get to some of the buttons\nthat I want to get to formatting.\n\n365\n00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:40.700\nIt's right here over the text and\nthis is character level formatting only.\n\n366\n00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.950\nYou don't see the center button or\nthe bullet button\n\n367\n00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:47.860\nbecause it's just showing what\nyou can do with the words here.\n\n368\n00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.220\nSo either from here or\ndown here you can go through and\n\n369\n00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.210\nchange the font that is available to you.\n\n370\n00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:59.376\nWhy don't I pick one,\nlet's go with Impact, sounds good.\n\n371\n00:20:59.376 --> 00:21:02.446\nChanging the font size,\nmake it bigger, make it smaller.\n\n372\n00:21:02.446 --> 00:21:04.220\nWe'll make it a little bit bigger.\n\n373\n00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:10.171\nBold, italic and underline,\nI don't know how else to explain bold,\n\n374\n00:21:10.171 --> 00:21:12.028\nitalic, and underline.\n\n375\n00:21:12.028 --> 00:21:13.250\n[LAUGH] They just do.\n\n376\n00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.940\n&gt;&gt; I can provide some different context.\n\n377\n00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.360\nDepending on who you're talking to,\n\n378\n00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:22.030\nbold can mean I really want to,\nlike this is important.\n\n379\n00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:28.110\nItalics is for emphasis or\nmaybe presents with sarcasm,\n\n380\n00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.850\nand then underline is either for\ntitles or something.\n\n381\n00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:36.590\nOr to say really look at this,\nit's kind of an extra added boom.\n\n382\n00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:41.156\nBut yeah, as far as what they do,\nthey're bold, italic, and underline.\n\n383\n00:21:41.156 --> 00:21:43.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there's not a lot to say about that.\n\n384\n00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:47.850\n&gt;&gt; You can tell I do a lot of\ndemonstration with bold italic.\n\n385\n00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:48.970\nHow do I explain bold?\n\n386\n00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:53.240\nIt just makes it bold, it's like you're\ndescribing the word with the word?\n\n387\n00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.760\nYeah, I feel like I'm almost there,\nso thank you very much for\n\n388\n00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.916\nthat lovely insight there.\n\n389\n00:21:56.916 --> 00:21:59.887\nAnd then sometimes, some fonts,\nyou make it bold and\n\n390\n00:21:59.887 --> 00:22:04.620\nit doesn't look any different because\nit's already like a thick font there.\n\n391\n00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:09.810\nAgain I want to try to keep it\nshort because I love topography and\n\n392\n00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:10.640\nall about typesetting.\n\n393\n00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.340\nSo we're gonna keep on moving.\n\n394\n00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:16.300\nOne thing about the underline though,\nif you underline something.\n\n395\n00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.660\nJustin, sometimes what does that mean\nto you if some text is underlined?\n\n396\n00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:25.255\n&gt;&gt; It's a title or\na heading or it's underlined?\n\n397\n00:22:25.255 --> 00:22:27.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Or a link?\n\n398\n00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.120\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n399\n00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.770\nSee, you made me look silly there, Oracle.\n\n400\n00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:36.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's okay though, she cast her spell.\n\n401\n00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:38.130\nBut, yeah, if it's a link.\n\n402\n00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.460\nBut usually I think of links of\nhaving a different color as well.\n\n403\n00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.410\nBut yeah, a lot of times in emails,\nif it's underlined, you should be careful.\n\n404\n00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:46.750\nBecause it may be a link,\n\n405\n00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:50.710\neven if it isn't a different color cuz\nsomeone can make it the same text color.\n\n406\n00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:54.878\nYou can change that and I'm sure we'll\nget to all that fun stuff [INAUDIBLE]\n\n407\n00:22:54.878 --> 00:22:56.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I've done that before,\n\n408\n00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.455\nwhere I'm clicking on things.\n\n409\n00:22:57.455 --> 00:23:00.800\nI'm like, why isn't this,\nyou just underlined it.\n\n410\n00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.390\nSo maybe it's more of like a me thing,\n\n411\n00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:06.760\nlike my head thinks, hey if it's\nunderlined it's gonna be a link.\n\n412\n00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.750\nBut, good, that was fun [LAUGH].\n\n413\n00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.730\nSo if I go over here to\nhigh lighting the text,\n\n414\n00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.830\nthat's just changing like\nthe background color of that text.\n\n415\n00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:18.212\nMaybe I'll make it yellow, and you don't\nsee it right now cuz it's still selected.\n\n416\n00:23:18.212 --> 00:23:25.420\nAnd let's change the font color to purple,\nclick off of it, there we go.\n\n417\n00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:29.490\nI have applied character\nformatting to this text.\n\n418\n00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:32.870\nSo I could do that with as\nmany words as I select,\n\n419\n00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:37.050\nwhether it's a few words,\nin a paragraph, the entire paragraph,\n\n420\n00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:41.455\nthe entire line,\njust those words have that formatting.\n\n421\n00:23:41.455 --> 00:23:47.290\nCenter, left, and right align, that\nwould be a paragraph level formatting.\n\n422\n00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.190\nAnd I know that there is a paragraph\nbecause right here I can\n\n423\n00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:53.101\nsee where the line has broken and\nit's starting another.\n\n424\n00:23:53.101 --> 00:23:58.136\nNow, I want to stop myself\nbecause you could have something\n\n425\n00:23:58.136 --> 00:24:03.573\nknown as line break to where it\nis- It's not a carriage return,\n\n426\n00:24:03.573 --> 00:24:07.000\nlike a full paragraph Enter mark.\n\n427\n00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.403\nIt is a Shift+Enter or\nbreaking the line that starts it, but\n\n428\n00:24:10.403 --> 00:24:12.685\nit's still part of the same paragraph.\n\n429\n00:24:12.685 --> 00:24:17.559\nI can't really tell that right now, but as\nsoon as I start making some formattings,\n\n430\n00:24:17.559 --> 00:24:21.074\nI would be able to do that,\nI just wanna throw that out there.\n\n431\n00:24:21.074 --> 00:24:23.668\nI'm gonna select this\nparagraph right here, and\n\n432\n00:24:23.668 --> 00:24:27.385\nthen down here I have left aligned,\nwhich it's already left aligned.\n\n433\n00:24:27.385 --> 00:24:31.132\nI have centered aligned, which then\ngoes ahead and center aligns this\n\n434\n00:24:31.132 --> 00:24:35.653\nwhole paragraph and, now this is where,\nnotice how I've selected just this.\n\n435\n00:24:35.653 --> 00:24:40.333\nI didn't actually plan for it to do\nthat but this is a perfect example of,\n\n436\n00:24:40.333 --> 00:24:44.888\nI selected this, but It's actually\ncentering this, this and this.\n\n437\n00:24:44.888 --> 00:24:49.135\nBut these aren't, right,\nso why is that happening?\n\n438\n00:24:49.135 --> 00:24:50.648\nThat was an example of,\n\n439\n00:24:50.648 --> 00:24:55.180\nit doesn't think that this is\na separate paragraph right now.\n\n440\n00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:59.773\nIf I hit Enter here,\nselect this paragraph, come over and\n\n441\n00:24:59.773 --> 00:25:04.668\nmake that left, you see how it\ndid not affect this paragraph.\n\n442\n00:25:04.668 --> 00:25:07.905\nSo this is where it can\nget a little weird,\n\n443\n00:25:07.905 --> 00:25:14.023\nsee how it did all of it where I thought\nit was just gonna do one, but it did both.\n\n444\n00:25:14.023 --> 00:25:20.081\nThose are kind of those hidden\nsyntax that you can't see sometimes,\n\n445\n00:25:20.081 --> 00:25:23.860\nof line breaks versus paragraph returns.\n\n446\n00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:28.246\nSo just be careful about that, and if I\nneeded it to be separate, like this needs\n\n447\n00:25:28.246 --> 00:25:32.643\nto be right aligned, the other needs to\nbe centered, and this needs to be left.\n\n448\n00:25:32.643 --> 00:25:37.262\nPutting your cursor into the place\nwhere you need to make a new paragraph,\n\n449\n00:25:37.262 --> 00:25:42.403\nthat will separate out, because I can\nhave different paragraph formatting for,\n\n450\n00:25:42.403 --> 00:25:44.790\nwell, different paragraphs.\n\n451\n00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:48.527\nSo that can throw things off here and\nthere, but\n\n452\n00:25:48.527 --> 00:25:50.967\nat least you know how to fix it.\n\n453\n00:25:50.967 --> 00:25:54.040\nWhat if I wanted to make\nsomething into a bulleted list?\n\n454\n00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:59.790\nYou select the text, I want to have these\nbe a numbered list or a bulleted list.\n\n455\n00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:01.430\nEither one, these are in HTML,\n\n456\n00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:06.830\nthis is ol and ul,\nan ordered list versus an unordered list.\n\n457\n00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:07.830\nDon't need to know that, but\n\n458\n00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:11.050\nif you think ordered, numbered,\nunordered, it's just bullets.\n\n459\n00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:15.974\nI can click on these different ones here,\nmake it either numbers or bullets,\n\n460\n00:26:15.974 --> 00:26:18.269\nI'm gonna put these into bullets.\n\n461\n00:26:18.269 --> 00:26:23.339\nIf I clicked here, because I needed\nanother level, say I needed to have\n\n462\n00:26:23.339 --> 00:26:29.271\na pool of tiers, but I need to have like a\nsublist, or a nested list as it's called.\n\n463\n00:26:29.271 --> 00:26:32.101\nYou can hit Enter because\nit's still going to,\n\n464\n00:26:32.101 --> 00:26:36.420\nanytime you hit Enter after a paragraph\nthat has paragraph formatting,\n\n465\n00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:40.830\nit's going to retain that level of\nformatting when you go to the next one.\n\n466\n00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:44.189\nSo you see how it's\nstaying in a bullet here,\n\n467\n00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:48.268\nthat's all right, though,\ncuz I want to go in one.\n\n468\n00:26:48.268 --> 00:26:52.455\nThe easiest way to do that in,\nlike writing text in a paragraph,\n\n469\n00:26:52.455 --> 00:26:54.147\nis just hit the Tab key.\n\n470\n00:26:54.147 --> 00:26:57.618\nIf you hit the Tab key,\nthat's going to indent yourself, and\n\n471\n00:26:57.618 --> 00:27:00.541\nmake you into that particular\nlevel of your list.\n\n472\n00:27:00.541 --> 00:27:04.954\nI can say sub topic 1,\nhit Enter again, and\n\n473\n00:27:04.954 --> 00:27:10.517\nthen it's going to go ahead and\ngive me sub topic 2.\n\n474\n00:27:10.517 --> 00:27:14.681\nLet's say I need another paragraph or\nanother, in this sense,\n\n475\n00:27:14.681 --> 00:27:16.542\nthese are chapters, sorry.\n\n476\n00:27:16.542 --> 00:27:21.232\nI wanna do another paragraph\nchapter [LAUGH], hit Enter.\n\n477\n00:27:21.232 --> 00:27:26.304\nI wanna get back out though, I don't\nwanna be in this same indented level.\n\n478\n00:27:26.304 --> 00:27:31.188\nTab to get in, Shift+Tab,\nhold your Shift key, click the Tab key,\n\n479\n00:27:31.188 --> 00:27:36.080\nand it'll take you out one level,\nand then I can say new chapter here.\n\n480\n00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.482\nSo I already had text typed in that I\nwanted to select and then format after it,\n\n481\n00:27:40.482 --> 00:27:43.622\nbut say you went ahead and\nsaid, I want to start a list.\n\n482\n00:27:43.622 --> 00:27:47.036\nAnd you click the bullet button, and\nyou start typing, and you hit Enter, and\n\n483\n00:27:47.036 --> 00:27:47.775\nyou keep going.\n\n484\n00:27:47.775 --> 00:27:54.250\nThat's how you could do your indenting and\noutdenting, as I call it.\n\n485\n00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:57.440\nAnd any time if I hit Enter\nin this particular paragraph,\n\n486\n00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.210\nI don't want to have the bullets.\n\n487\n00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:02.570\nYou just come down here and\nyou turn the bullets off, and\n\n488\n00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:05.790\nthen it's an on or off type of thing.\n\n489\n00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:08.664\nNow, the last thing,\n\n490\n00:28:08.664 --> 00:28:12.327\nbecause I think we're getting towards\nthe end of our episode here, so.\n\n491\n00:28:12.327 --> 00:28:17.140\n&gt;&gt; Yes you are absolutely correct,\nit is, we're running nigh on time.\n\n492\n00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.736\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well let me show you this one,\nand\n\n493\n00:28:19.736 --> 00:28:23.283\nthat will complete our\nparagraph level formatting.\n\n494\n00:28:23.283 --> 00:28:28.297\nAnd then we'll move on to some of\nthe other stuff that I want to talk about.\n\n495\n00:28:28.297 --> 00:28:30.884\nI think we might have a few parts here,\nJustin.\n\n496\n00:28:30.884 --> 00:28:33.989\n&gt;&gt; We may do it, but\nthat's all right, because, well,\n\n497\n00:28:33.989 --> 00:28:39.200\nyou're gonna have beautiful, a little, how\ndo you say, wonderful emails, right, so.\n\n498\n00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:39.957\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, gorgeous.\n\n499\n00:28:39.957 --> 00:28:43.503\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Just, I am at a lost of words.\n\n500\n00:28:43.503 --> 00:28:45.296\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know right?\n\n501\n00:28:45.296 --> 00:28:48.581\nAnd I'm looking at this and I'm like,\nI'm not sure if we can categorize this as\n\n502\n00:28:48.581 --> 00:28:51.150\ngorgeous, but you know what,\nwe'll run with it, so [LAUGH].\n\n503\n00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:55.486\nI have this paragraph, let's go ahead and\nmake this left aligned for now.\n\n504\n00:28:55.486 --> 00:29:00.590\nBecause the other things that you can do\nare known as, you can go ahead and indent.\n\n505\n00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:05.671\nIf I indent it, let's decrease,\nif I indent, I'm pulling in what\n\n506\n00:29:05.671 --> 00:29:10.765\nwe call from the margins in here,\nand I'm indenting my paragraph.\n\n507\n00:29:10.765 --> 00:29:14.101\nIf I click it again,\nnotice that it's indenting even more.\n\n508\n00:29:14.101 --> 00:29:17.491\nSo if you ever needed to do that and\nkinda force it over,\n\n509\n00:29:17.491 --> 00:29:22.600\nmaybe you wanna add a little emphasis, or\nthis is a quote, you can do that as well.\n\n510\n00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.199\nNow, back on those lists,\n\n511\n00:29:24.199 --> 00:29:27.196\ncuz I was telling you to do your Tabs and\nShift+Tabs.\n\n512\n00:29:27.196 --> 00:29:31.285\nThese buttons, these indenting,\nincrease indent and\n\n513\n00:29:31.285 --> 00:29:35.600\ndecrease indent,\nthey also work in your list levels.\n\n514\n00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:40.069\nFor example, if I click my cursor, cuz I\ngotta put my cursor into the place that\n\n515\n00:29:40.069 --> 00:29:44.976\nI want to change, and also take notice,\nI'm not selecting the text that's in here.\n\n516\n00:29:44.976 --> 00:29:47.864\nBecause any time you have\nparagraph level formatting,\n\n517\n00:29:47.864 --> 00:29:51.560\nyou actually don't have to select\nall the words within the paragraph.\n\n518\n00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:57.080\nBecause that level of formatting\nwill apply to the whole paragraph.\n\n519\n00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:01.420\nI put my cursor where I want here,\nand if I click this increase indent,\n\n520\n00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.451\nnotice that it will then\nindent that list level.\n\n521\n00:30:04.451 --> 00:30:09.283\nOr, with the cursor where I want it,\nI can decrease this indent.\n\n522\n00:30:09.283 --> 00:30:14.003\nSo if you don't like to do\nthe Shift+Tab and the Tabs to go in and\n\n523\n00:30:14.003 --> 00:30:20.255\nout of your list levels, you can use these\nbuttons to increase or decrease as well.\n\n524\n00:30:20.255 --> 00:30:25.549\nSo, that actually does cover all of\nthe character level formating and\n\n525\n00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:29.587\nparagraph level formating\nthat is available to you,\n\n526\n00:30:29.587 --> 00:30:32.563\nwhen you're using Outlook on the web.\n\n527\n00:30:32.563 --> 00:30:34.533\nAnd so we will continue from there.\n\n528\n00:30:34.533 --> 00:30:37.681\n&gt;&gt; Well, sounds like we're gonna\nhave a part two, maybe even a part,\n\n529\n00:30:37.681 --> 00:30:39.958\nwho knows how many parts\nwe're gonna have here.\n\n530\n00:30:39.958 --> 00:30:43.496\nBut I do know that we have a lot more\nformatting that is available to us\n\n531\n00:30:43.496 --> 00:30:45.933\nwhen we're using kind\nof this richer editor.\n\n532\n00:30:45.933 --> 00:30:50.441\nAnd if you've been around for a while,\nyou know that email used to just be,\n\n533\n00:30:50.441 --> 00:30:52.527\nyou type the text and you hit Send.\n\n534\n00:30:52.527 --> 00:30:55.790\nBut our oracle has definitely\nilluminated our way for us.\n\n535\n00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:59.897\nBut we do have more, so continue with\nus as we look at Outlook on the web.\n\n536\n00:30:59.897 --> 00:31:02.507\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for OfficeProTV.\n\n537\n00:31:02.507 --> 00:31:03.588\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n538\n00:31:03.588 --> 00:31:04.520\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n539\n00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.218\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n540\n00:31:06.218 --> 00:31:11.801\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Pro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.930\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and well,\nwe're back with more Outlook on the Web,\n\n4\n00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.670\nand we're in the part two\nof formatting our messages.\n\n5\n00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.910\nAnd here to help us along, well,\nour journey through the Outlook\n\n6\n00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.510\nlandscape is our very own Outlook oracle,\nMs. Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.490\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n8\n00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.710\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nI decided to come back on my Falcor, and\n\n9\n00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.280\ntell you all about the wonderful\nworld of message formatting.\n\n10\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.804\nAnd like he said, we are continuing on.\n\n11\n00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:38.556\nIn part one, we talked about our\ncharacter and paragraph level formatting,\n\n12\n00:00:38.556 --> 00:00:42.727\nand some of the AutoCorrect options, and\nfeatures that happen within your browser.\n\n13\n00:00:42.727 --> 00:00:47.792\nSo now we're going to start adding\nsome other content within our HTML\n\n14\n00:00:47.792 --> 00:00:53.060\nformatted messages, to allow for\nimages, hyperlinks and tables.\n\n15\n00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.460\nSo let's jump back in.\n\n16\n00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.610\nI'm actually right where we\nleft off in our part one,\n\n17\n00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.780\nas we were going down that rabbit hole.\n\n18\n00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.260\nAnd we decided to make this some purple\ntext with some yellow highlighting,\n\n19\n00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.670\nwe did our different paragraph level\nformatting with our alignments and\n\n20\n00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.387\nour bulleted, and\nour numbered list in the different levels.\n\n21\n00:01:12.387 --> 00:01:16.072\nA few more little tiny things about\nsome character level formattings,\n\n22\n00:01:16.072 --> 00:01:19.946\nto really just go through each one of\nthese buttons before we get into what\n\n23\n00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:23.810\nthese little loopy things look like,\nwhich are insert hyperlink.\n\n24\n00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.615\nYou have some other character\nformattings which would be superscript,\n\n25\n00:01:28.615 --> 00:01:30.749\nsubscript and strike through.\n\n26\n00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:34.396\nSo these are things that you would\nhave to add to specific characters.\n\n27\n00:01:34.396 --> 00:01:38.400\nSo that's that character level formatting\nversus that paragraph level formatting.\n\n28\n00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.180\nSo for example, if for some reason I\nneeded sub topic 1 to be almost like\n\n29\n00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.660\nan exponent, sub topic to the 1,\nwhich isn't it always itself?\n\n30\n00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.030\nSome of that statistics is coming back.\n\n31\n00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.766\nIt's starting to scare me.\n\n32\n00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:53.956\n&gt;&gt; Yes, to the first power.\n\n33\n00:01:53.956 --> 00:01:54.477\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n34\n00:01:54.477 --> 00:01:55.615\n&gt;&gt; I was like, I'm confused.\n\n35\n00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:58.538\nSubtopic is one is, I guess,\nthat's what you put it at.\n\n36\n00:01:58.538 --> 00:01:59.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yes,\n\n37\n00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.090\nto the first power is itself, right?\n\n38\n00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.190\nOne to the one,\none to the first power is one so.\n\n39\n00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.001\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n40\n00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:07.129\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're correct.\n\n41\n00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:09.787\n&gt;&gt; It's been a long time\nsince I took statistics and\n\n42\n00:02:09.787 --> 00:02:13.130\nanything math related, so\nI was just trying to remember that.\n\n43\n00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.278\nBut as you can see, if I selected\nthat particular character and\n\n44\n00:02:17.278 --> 00:02:22.770\nmade it a superscript, it goes above\nthe sub, would go, well, here, let me.\n\n45\n00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.712\nI would have to actually undo here.\n\n46\n00:02:24.712 --> 00:02:25.306\nPerfect.\n\n47\n00:02:25.306 --> 00:02:29.565\nNow I can go to the Undo button of where\nI didn't really want to do that, and\n\n48\n00:02:29.565 --> 00:02:33.069\nI can undo again because what I did is,\nI superscripted it and\n\n49\n00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.436\nthen I wanted to subscript the\nsuperscript, and it got a little confused.\n\n50\n00:02:37.436 --> 00:02:41.015\nSo I needed to go ahead and\ndo our lovely Undo button.\n\n51\n00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:42.289\nNever forget that button.\n\n52\n00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:45.020\nIt's a grand old thing, so I can undo it.\n\n53\n00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.764\nSo now once I've gotten back to\nthe character being in the regular format,\n\n54\n00:02:49.764 --> 00:02:53.207\nwe'll say, and we can go ahead and\nthen subscript it.\n\n55\n00:02:53.207 --> 00:02:57.941\nAnd you can see it's really small because\nthose types of things are a little\n\n56\n00:02:57.941 --> 00:03:03.060\nsmaller, but that's where the character\nis going above or below the baseline.\n\n57\n00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.680\nThe baseline is where all\nthe text actually sits.\n\n58\n00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.845\nLike lined paper on say, well, graph\npaper, lined paper, college ruled paper.\n\n59\n00:03:12.845 --> 00:03:16.054\nI'm gonna stop because I can already feel\nmyself wanting to explain all of things.\n\n60\n00:03:16.054 --> 00:03:19.573\n[LAUGH] And get into letting and\nwe'll stop.\n\n61\n00:03:19.573 --> 00:03:23.715\nSo we have our strike through as well,\nthat's just going to strike through our\n\n62\n00:03:23.715 --> 00:03:27.255\ntext to maybe show people\nthat it is crossed out.\n\n63\n00:03:27.255 --> 00:03:31.579\nSo that would complete\nthe character formatting\n\n64\n00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.940\noptions that we have on this line.\n\n65\n00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.460\nThese right here, these two buttons are\nwhether you want your text to go left to\n\n66\n00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.250\nright or right to left,\ndepending on your language preference.\n\n67\n00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.310\nSo if I selected this paragraph and\nnoticed that it goes that way, that\n\n68\n00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.750\ngets a little confusing so we're gonna go\nahead and put it the other way cuz I can't\n\n69\n00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.020\nread right to left, but at least you\nknow that those buttons do exist.\n\n70\n00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.040\nAnd so if you wanted to remove\nthe character formatting, let's say, mm,\n\n71\n00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.330\nthis down the rabbit hole, I don't like\nthe purple and yellow going on here.\n\n72\n00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.136\nIf I select that text over here towards\nthe end, I have the A with a little,\n\n73\n00:04:16.136 --> 00:04:21.398\nlooks like a little eraser and\nit's remove formatting or eraser.\n\n74\n00:04:21.398 --> 00:04:26.598\nAnd notice if I click on that,\nit will not erase it.\n\n75\n00:04:26.598 --> 00:04:27.806\nAnd [LAUGH] why is that?\n\n76\n00:04:27.806 --> 00:04:29.490\nLet's try it again.\n\n77\n00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.110\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, it seems like you're\nhaving a little bit of an issue.\n\n78\n00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.275\nUsually that works for me as well because\nI like to get a little crazy with\n\n79\n00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.680\nformatting, and\nthen I second guess myself.\n\n80\n00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.690\nWhat do you think is going on?\n\n81\n00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.997\n&gt;&gt; What I'm thinking here is that, okay.\n\n82\n00:04:42.997 --> 00:04:48.396\nSo the way I have my computer set up,\nI am running a Windows operating\n\n83\n00:04:48.396 --> 00:04:53.628\nmachine with an Edge browser through\na virtual machine on my Mac.\n\n84\n00:04:53.628 --> 00:04:56.259\nAnd if anybody's worked in\nvirtual machines before,\n\n85\n00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.156\nthey can get a little wonky sometimes.\n\n86\n00:04:58.156 --> 00:05:01.574\nI know you have to do some mapping and\nsome keyboard things.\n\n87\n00:05:01.574 --> 00:05:05.273\nAnd so I'm pretty sure that this\nis going to be blamed on the VM,\n\n88\n00:05:05.273 --> 00:05:08.020\nbecause I use this button\nall the time as well.\n\n89\n00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.118\nAnd I've never had an issue\nwith why is it not doing it?\n\n90\n00:05:11.118 --> 00:05:12.533\nSo let's do something.\n\n91\n00:05:12.533 --> 00:05:17.252\nWe're going to jump over into\nmy actual Macintosh computer.\n\n92\n00:05:17.252 --> 00:05:20.861\nSo we're going to past Justin,\nand we're gonna come out here.\n\n93\n00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:25.801\nSo this is my actual desktop of my\ncomputer in Mac, I'm in Chrome,\n\n94\n00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:28.570\nhave the same email pulled up.\n\n95\n00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.680\nAnd I think the button is\nactually now behind my head.\n\n96\n00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.840\nSo let's try this again, so\nyou can see it actually working.\n\n97\n00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.431\nI'm selecting a text that I want\nto remove the formatting to, and\n\n98\n00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:42.949\nthen back over there that button\nthat is the A with the eraser thing.\n\n99\n00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.267\nTa-da, see?\n\n100\n00:05:44.267 --> 00:05:46.920\n[LAUGH] So it does work.\n\n101\n00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.252\nI just am having a little bit of some\ntechnical issues with those VMs.\n\n102\n00:05:51.252 --> 00:05:54.905\nBut love them sometimes, most of the time,\nbut every once in a while.\n\n103\n00:05:54.905 --> 00:05:58.327\n&gt;&gt; And actually this is kind of a problem\nthat I've had with VMs, too, like\n\n104\n00:05:58.327 --> 00:06:02.387\nthe weird mouse captures and sometimes\nwhen you're selecting things and trying to\n\n105\n00:06:02.387 --> 00:06:06.290\nclick some other things to do, kind of\nthis orchestrated series of events.\n\n106\n00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.990\nSometimes the VM kind of flickers on me.\n\n107\n00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.360\nAnd you have two VMs open, so\n\n108\n00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.660\nthat kind of exacerbates the problem cuz\nyou're consuming a lot of resources.\n\n109\n00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.982\nBut we know it works and\nthat's what's important.\n\n110\n00:06:15.982 --> 00:06:18.001\nSo good thinking on your feet there,\nVonne.\n\n111\n00:06:18.001 --> 00:06:19.938\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, thank you for that.\n\n112\n00:06:19.938 --> 00:06:21.148\nBut like hey, what's going on?\n\n113\n00:06:21.148 --> 00:06:23.674\nI bet you that's what it is,\ncuz I know you've run into that, too.\n\n114\n00:06:23.674 --> 00:06:25.969\nSo let's jump back over.\n\n115\n00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:30.730\nI do love the swipe gesture so\n[LAUGH], it's just kind of fun.\n\n116\n00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.998\nSo back here into where we're going next,\n\n117\n00:06:32.998 --> 00:06:37.300\nwe've covered all those different\ncharacter and paragraph formattings.\n\n118\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.840\nLet's move on to hyperlinks.\n\n119\n00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.090\nSo I want to put in a hyperlink.\n\n120\n00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.700\nNow if I'm copying and pasting,\na lot of times a hyperlink or\n\n121\n00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.030\nthe URL linked to wherever\nI'm going is going to copy.\n\n122\n00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.400\nBut right down here I\nhave let's go to Amazon,\n\n123\n00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.750\ncuz maybe I want to purchase a few things.\n\n124\n00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.250\nSo I want to make this in a hyperlink or\nmaybe I just wanna go ahead and\n\n125\n00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.200\ncopy the URL from my browser,\nand then just paste it into here.\n\n126\n00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.070\nSo I wanna show you\nthese different options.\n\n127\n00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:09.858\nYou could select the text first to\nmake that text be the actual link.\n\n128\n00:07:09.858 --> 00:07:12.660\nLet's jump down into my browser.\n\n129\n00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.451\nWe'll another tab over here.\n\n130\n00:07:15.451 --> 00:07:20.343\nAnd we will go to amazon.com, or well,\nI guess Bing will take me there first and\n\n131\n00:07:20.343 --> 00:07:22.240\nthen I will click on this.\n\n132\n00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.620\nAnd so now I'd like to go ahead and\ncreate a link to this website.\n\n133\n00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:32.033\nSo I do need to come up into the address\nbar and get the link that I want to copy.\n\n134\n00:07:32.033 --> 00:07:35.760\nI'm gonna right-click on this so\nyou can see me actually doing it.\n\n135\n00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.640\nCome back down into my message.\n\n136\n00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.080\nAnd with the text selected, if I wanted\nto make that clickable to that particular\n\n137\n00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.600\nURL, you do the little link buttons\ndown here on this format toolbar.\n\n138\n00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.003\nSo inserting a link, and then here is\nwhere I could go ahead and paste that in.\n\n139\n00:07:55.003 --> 00:08:00.132\nI click OK and\nnow this has become a clickable link.\n\n140\n00:08:00.132 --> 00:08:04.197\nWhen somebody gets that, they can go\nahead and click it and it goes to it.\n\n141\n00:08:04.197 --> 00:08:09.907\nAll well and good if I wanted the words\nto be different than the actual address.\n\n142\n00:08:09.907 --> 00:08:12.522\nLet me show you something\na little different.\n\n143\n00:08:12.522 --> 00:08:15.771\nLet's go back over to Amazon,\nwell I've already copied it so\n\n144\n00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:19.338\nI'm not gonna copy again but\njust to go through the procedure again.\n\n145\n00:08:19.338 --> 00:08:23.748\nYou go to the website,\nyou copy the address and\n\n146\n00:08:23.748 --> 00:08:30.100\nyou come back to your message, and\nthen you just paste in the link.\n\n147\n00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.967\nAnd notice what happens if I scroll down,\nit's like what's that?\n\n148\n00:08:33.967 --> 00:08:37.437\nThis is the wonderful\nworld of link previewing.\n\n149\n00:08:37.437 --> 00:08:39.573\nIf you've ever used Facebook before,\n\n150\n00:08:39.573 --> 00:08:43.586\nthis might look familiar where in a post\nyou go ahead and post something and\n\n151\n00:08:43.586 --> 00:08:46.970\nit gives you like that little picture and\nsome text next to it.\n\n152\n00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.940\nAnd sometimes it doesn't even match up, or\nsometimes it doesn't even give it to you.\n\n153\n00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:55.240\nWell, Outlook is doing that as well or\nat least Outlook on the web.\n\n154\n00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.102\nSo the link previewing is built in.\n\n155\n00:08:58.102 --> 00:09:02.654\nI will say, that not every website with\ntheir URL if you paste in this way,\n\n156\n00:09:02.654 --> 00:09:05.528\nnot everyone's gonna have a preview, okay.\n\n157\n00:09:05.528 --> 00:09:09.327\nSo if it doesn't, don't get too alarmed.\n\n158\n00:09:09.327 --> 00:09:14.971\nI kinda like this, and I kinda don't like\nit, it just depends on the situation.\n\n159\n00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:20.249\nBut this is a setting,\nthis is a setting that is in your mail,\n\n160\n00:09:20.249 --> 00:09:23.380\nthat you can turn on or off.\n\n161\n00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.060\nAnd while I'm still on the pop out,\nI'm not going to navigate to it but\n\n162\n00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.260\nit is in your setting,\nyou go in through the mail and\n\n163\n00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.520\nyou go on to the layout section and\nit's under link preview.\n\n164\n00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.501\nSo definitely go back and\nlook for that in your settings and\n\n165\n00:09:38.501 --> 00:09:42.166\nyou can turn this previewing\noff if you do not like it.\n\n166\n00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:45.065\nAnd we'll keep it there for now.\n\n167\n00:09:45.065 --> 00:09:49.486\nLet's move on to inserting a picture.\n\n168\n00:09:49.486 --> 00:09:52.623\nNow this is not the same\nas attaching a picture.\n\n169\n00:09:52.623 --> 00:09:57.658\nYou're putting the picture inside of\nthe message body, not as a separate\n\n170\n00:09:57.658 --> 00:10:02.209\nfile that you want people to be able\nto transfer to their own computer.\n\n171\n00:10:02.209 --> 00:10:05.034\nSo you put your cursor where\nyou want the picture to go.\n\n172\n00:10:05.034 --> 00:10:06.216\nThat's always step one.\n\n173\n00:10:06.216 --> 00:10:07.390\nSelect to effect.\n\n174\n00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.488\nThis is what I want.\n\n175\n00:10:08.488 --> 00:10:13.244\nDown here at the bottom,\nyou have the insert picture in line,\n\n176\n00:10:13.244 --> 00:10:15.535\nso in line with your message.\n\n177\n00:10:15.535 --> 00:10:19.318\nI click it and now its going to\ntake me out into my computer,\n\n178\n00:10:19.318 --> 00:10:22.575\nwhere I can go ahead and\nfind pictures that I want.\n\n179\n00:10:22.575 --> 00:10:24.469\nNow it automatically goes\nto my Pictures folder,\n\n180\n00:10:24.469 --> 00:10:26.720\nbecause that's just the way Windows works.\n\n181\n00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.400\nNow, if you did have\nyour One Drive connected,\n\n182\n00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.550\nyou could always get\ninto your cloud services.\n\n183\n00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.770\nBut you would have to have\nOne Drive of your subscription\n\n184\n00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.460\ninstalled on your computer.\n\n185\n00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.840\nAnd you need to be able\nto access it there,\n\n186\n00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.130\nnot the regular One Drive that is\ninstalled with your operating system.\n\n187\n00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.520\nSo I wanna throw that out there.\n\n188\n00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.460\nI'll pick this selected picture.\n\n189\n00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.640\nWe'll go with Joey.\n\n190\n00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.840\nI click Open and\nthen my picture comes into my message.\n\n191\n00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.572\nNow this pictures kinda big right there.\n\n192\n00:10:58.572 --> 00:10:59.563\n[SOUND] Okay,\n\n193\n00:10:59.563 --> 00:11:05.158\nwell I really didn't want it to take\nup all of the space within my message.\n\n194\n00:11:05.158 --> 00:11:06.969\nCouple things you can do here.\n\n195\n00:11:06.969 --> 00:11:10.093\nIf you select the picture and\nit's kind of small and\n\n196\n00:11:10.093 --> 00:11:14.890\nit kind of hard to see, but there's some\nblue dots and each one on the corner and\n\n197\n00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:18.834\nthere's a thin blue line to let\nyou know you have that selected.\n\n198\n00:11:18.834 --> 00:11:20.651\nOnce you have it selected,\n\n199\n00:11:20.651 --> 00:11:26.220\nyou could come over here to the corners\nwith the two pointed arrows.\n\n200\n00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:30.842\nYou could click, hold, and drag and\nstart dragging that in to make it smaller.\n\n201\n00:11:30.842 --> 00:11:35.972\nThe nice thing about this is that it does\nkeep the aspect ratio and the proportions\n\n202\n00:11:35.972 --> 00:11:40.661\nconstrained, so you don't have to\nworry about squashing your picture.\n\n203\n00:11:40.661 --> 00:11:43.708\nBut an easier way to do\nsome of this sizing,\n\n204\n00:11:43.708 --> 00:11:47.870\nis if you, once selected, so\nmust have it selected first.\n\n205\n00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:48.958\nIf you right click,\n\n206\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:54.090\nnotice that right-clicking will give you\noptions that you can do with this picture.\n\n207\n00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.570\nAnd some of them are pretty cute.\n\n208\n00:11:55.570 --> 00:12:00.512\nYou can apply a border, you could apply a\nshape and you can apply, it's really only\n\n209\n00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:05.050\nsquare or round and it's just the corners,\nand you can apply some shadows.\n\n210\n00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:09.913\nSo some of those really cool features that\nyou can do with image manipulation within\n\n211\n00:12:09.913 --> 00:12:14.497\nyour Office products is being carried\nover in to the Outlook for Web versions,\n\n212\n00:12:14.497 --> 00:12:16.663\nso you have a couple of neat options.\n\n213\n00:12:16.663 --> 00:12:22.329\nThe one I'm starting with was the size,\nthe small, best fit and original.\n\n214\n00:12:22.329 --> 00:12:25.980\nI can just come in here, click on\nsmall and like well that's perfect.\n\n215\n00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:30.585\nIt kinda just automatically sizes it to\nalmost like in proportion to my message\n\n216\n00:12:30.585 --> 00:12:32.063\nand it makes it smaller.\n\n217\n00:12:32.063 --> 00:12:35.333\nThat's a lot easier than\ntrying to drag the corner and\n\n218\n00:12:35.333 --> 00:12:37.670\nmake the picture a little bit tinier.\n\n219\n00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:42.210\nBut again, selecting it first,\nthen right-clicking it,\n\n220\n00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:47.194\nyou could rotate this turn it left or\nright, or flip it horizontal,\n\n221\n00:12:47.194 --> 00:12:50.767\ncuz maybe I want the joey\nto be turning this way.\n\n222\n00:12:50.767 --> 00:12:52.328\nSo now he's looking that way.\n\n223\n00:12:52.328 --> 00:12:53.206\nIsn't that cute?\n\n224\n00:12:53.206 --> 00:12:58.589\nSo left-click, right-click,\ncoming into the border colors,\n\n225\n00:12:58.589 --> 00:13:03.310\nmaybe throw on a purple-ish,\nmauve color border there.\n\n226\n00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.089\nAnd maybe the border shapes.\n\n227\n00:13:05.089 --> 00:13:07.016\nThis is where I was showing you,\nit's just going to round the corners.\n\n228\n00:13:07.016 --> 00:13:09.097\nIt's not going making an actual circle.\n\n229\n00:13:09.097 --> 00:13:13.503\nAnd you could also throw on\na drop shadow of a medium or\n\n230\n00:13:13.503 --> 00:13:16.315\nthicker or smaller drop shadow.\n\n231\n00:13:16.315 --> 00:13:20.766\nSo just some cute,\nlittle formats that you can do.\n\n232\n00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:25.969\nNow, one thing I wanted to\nthrow out there as well,\n\n233\n00:13:25.969 --> 00:13:29.116\nwould be the instert alt text.\n\n234\n00:13:29.116 --> 00:13:34.110\nInsert alt text is something with\naccessibility, because we had talked about\n\n235\n00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:38.799\nmessage formatting in the sense of a plain\ntext or an HTML or maybe you have,\n\n236\n00:13:38.799 --> 00:13:43.140\nJustin said about how HTML is\nrendered within different browsers.\n\n237\n00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.102\nSome of those may be on a limited HTML.\n\n238\n00:13:46.102 --> 00:13:50.332\nThere could be that people\naren't showing pictures and\n\n239\n00:13:50.332 --> 00:13:54.330\nit'll show a box, but\nnothing else in there.\n\n240\n00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.740\nWell, if you add alternate text,\na lot of times,\n\n241\n00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:03.230\nit'll put the text inside that box to\nlet you know what the picture was about.\n\n242\n00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:06.202\nThis is also really important for\naccessibility,\n\n243\n00:14:06.202 --> 00:14:11.038\ncuz you have things like screen readers to\nbe able to read the information that's in\n\n244\n00:14:11.038 --> 00:14:13.752\nthe page without being\nable to see it visibly.\n\n245\n00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:19.893\nSo you could add that alternate text of\nwhat is this picture supposed to be, and\n\n246\n00:14:19.893 --> 00:14:26.421\nyou could say cute baby kangaroo or just\njoey, whichever one you wanted to go with.\n\n247\n00:14:26.421 --> 00:14:30.511\nYou're not gonna see it but\nthe code, if you wanna say,\n\n248\n00:14:30.511 --> 00:14:34.427\nthat goes along with this\npicture will stay with it and\n\n249\n00:14:34.427 --> 00:14:39.586\nthat's always a good thing to know\nabout when you're adding images.\n\n250\n00:14:39.586 --> 00:14:43.904\nLast thing here is if I try to get rid of\nthis, I don't want this, a lot of times\n\n251\n00:14:43.904 --> 00:14:47.573\nyou think about just hitting\nthe Backspace key or the Delete key.\n\n252\n00:14:47.573 --> 00:14:50.829\nAnd that doesn't seem to work all\nthe time either because that Delete or\n\n253\n00:14:50.829 --> 00:14:54.730\nBackspace can sometimes be mapped\ndifferently to within your browser.\n\n254\n00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.900\nSo that's why they put that trashcan\nover there on the left hand side for\n\n255\n00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:03.500\nyou to be able to remove this\npicture if you wanted to.\n\n256\n00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.080\nAnd I guess one last thing.\n\n257\n00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:12.195\nSorry, there's a last, last thing,\nis that there's no text wrap on an image.\n\n258\n00:15:12.195 --> 00:15:15.856\nIf I took this image, and\nlet's go ahead and cut this.\n\n259\n00:15:15.856 --> 00:15:20.841\nI'm going to do a Ctrl+X to get to cut,\nand I come up into here, and\n\n260\n00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:25.662\nthen I come into the middle of\nmy paragraph, and then I Ctrl+V.\n\n261\n00:15:25.662 --> 00:15:29.324\nI can't take this and move it around and\nhave the text go to the left or\n\n262\n00:15:29.324 --> 00:15:31.100\nto the right of this image.\n\n263\n00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.520\nIt doesn't really like that very well.\n\n264\n00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:40.300\nSo just know that if you're used to\nbeing able to use some of these advanced\n\n265\n00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.730\nformattings of images in your Outlook for\nyour desktop like Outlook 2016,\n\n266\n00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:49.840\nyou don't have that same capabilities\nhere in the Outlook for web.\n\n267\n00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.435\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and just click\nthat undo button a couple of times and,\n\n268\n00:15:54.435 --> 00:15:55.790\nthere we go, keep on moving down.\n\n269\n00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.240\nMaybe undo one more time.\n\n270\n00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:58.770\nThere we go.\n\n271\n00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:02.362\nYeah, just keep on clicking\nuntil you get backwards, and\n\n272\n00:16:02.362 --> 00:16:05.678\nthere we have our insert images and\nhow we can do that.\n\n273\n00:16:05.678 --> 00:16:09.580\nYou could always insert an emoji\nwhich are kind of cute now.\n\n274\n00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.564\nI've gotten emails from people and it puts\nlike the little boxes with an x on it,\n\n275\n00:16:13.564 --> 00:16:15.770\nhave you ever gotten one of those, Justin?\n\n276\n00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:19.770\n&gt;&gt; I haven't and they don't have a the\nemoji set, essentially the character set\n\n277\n00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:22.620\nin order to render the emojis, and you're\njust like I don't know what you're saying.\n\n278\n00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.562\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It just looks like you went x x x x.\n\n279\n00:16:24.562 --> 00:16:27.935\nI was like, is it, are you trying to\ntell me, am I fired or something?\n\n280\n00:16:27.935 --> 00:16:29.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What happened?\n\n281\n00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:30.850\nBut yeah,\nI've gotten things like that as well.\n\n282\n00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:35.174\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and the emoji set that\nis here in Outlook for web,\n\n283\n00:16:35.174 --> 00:16:38.120\nif we go down here to the little emoji.\n\n284\n00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.340\nThey don't, of course I picked a bunny,\nsomewhere in there, but\n\n285\n00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:46.900\nthey don't look like the same\nemojis that I have on my iPhone and\n\n286\n00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.490\nI don't know if the coding\nbehind it is the same.\n\n287\n00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.148\nAnd it's funny cuz once I've gotten\nback on Outlook for web, or read it,\n\n288\n00:16:53.148 --> 00:16:56.157\nI'm like,\nthat's it the emoji that they're seeing,\n\n289\n00:16:56.157 --> 00:17:00.012\nversus I'm in my Gmail and it's the same\none, I'm like, what's going on.\n\n290\n00:17:00.012 --> 00:17:04.762\nSo some of these don't always translate\nbut it is cute to go ahead and\n\n291\n00:17:04.762 --> 00:17:09.108\nadd a little smiley face in there\nif you wanted to add an emoji,\n\n292\n00:17:09.108 --> 00:17:11.218\na little graphical fun there.\n\n293\n00:17:11.218 --> 00:17:15.880\nThe last element that you can add into\nyour message body would be a table.\n\n294\n00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:22.223\nNow, a table is a set of information\nthat is in a row and column or\n\n295\n00:17:22.223 --> 00:17:28.090\na tabular format and where columns and\nrows intersect are known as cells.\n\n296\n00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:29.720\nIt's actually behind my head.\n\n297\n00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:35.810\nThe button down over here that looks like\na table is where you can insert table.\n\n298\n00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.730\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nmake a pretty small one for now.\n\n299\n00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:42.240\nLet's go with a three by two.\n\n300\n00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.011\nSo that means I'm doing three columns,\ntwo rows.\n\n301\n00:17:46.011 --> 00:17:49.711\nSo you just hover over\nthe amount of boxes, we'll say,\n\n302\n00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:53.230\nto say this is the amount of rows and\ncolumns I want.\n\n303\n00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.210\nYou click it and it goes ahead and\nputs a table in.\n\n304\n00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:00.070\nTo go ahead and put text into the table\nyou can either use your cursor\n\n305\n00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:05.310\nto click your cursor into the cell that\nyou want the information to go into and\n\n306\n00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.280\nthen you can type in the information.\n\n307\n00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.770\nI'm just going to say text.\n\n308\n00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:15.100\nTo get to the next cell over, you can hit\nyour tab key but of course using your\n\n309\n00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:21.290\nmouse, there's nothing wrong with that and\nI can type in text and I can type in text.\n\n310\n00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.530\nDon't hit the enter key at that last row.\n\n311\n00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:24.990\nYou hit the tab key.\n\n312\n00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:29.340\nSo if you're familiar with working\nin tables from other programs,\n\n313\n00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.797\nthat tab and moving around this fine.\n\n314\n00:18:31.797 --> 00:18:37.712\nI wanna point out though that using\ntables in Outlook for web, it's not as,\n\n315\n00:18:37.712 --> 00:18:44.790\nI wanna say fluid as working with tables\nin Outlook 2016 on the desktop version.\n\n316\n00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:49.680\nFor example if I wanted to\nchange the colors of the cells,\n\n317\n00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:57.930\nI can't select the text or select empty\ncells and say do things like merge cells.\n\n318\n00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:01.306\nIt's something that it's kinda ingrained\nin me because that's what you would need\n\n319\n00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:04.300\nto do to merge, you would need\nto select them and merge them.\n\n320\n00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.860\nIt doesn't work like that necessarily.\n\n321\n00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.300\nYou have to kinda go about\nit in a different way.\n\n322\n00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.440\nIt's all about where your cursor is,\nright clicking.\n\n323\n00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:19.128\nJust like we had right clicked on that\nimage to get some of the options for\n\n324\n00:19:19.128 --> 00:19:24.617\nimages, if I right click within this cell\nwithin the second row, there is a merge.\n\n325\n00:19:24.617 --> 00:19:27.785\nAnd so this is where merge\nabove below left and right.\n\n326\n00:19:27.785 --> 00:19:30.900\nYou have to do it one cell at a time.\n\n327\n00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.010\nSo to merge these three cells across,\n\n328\n00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:38.540\nI would have to say let's merge to\nthe right and those two cells merge.\n\n329\n00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.670\nNow that I'm in this cell,\nI would right-click again and\n\n330\n00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:48.220\ngo with Merge right and\nthat's how I can get merged cells.\n\n331\n00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:53.060\nIf you have text inside of your cells,\nyou could select it but\n\n332\n00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.950\nagain you're not gonna be able\nto do table formatting here.\n\n333\n00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:00.880\nYou're just going to be formatting the\ncharacters or the character formatting or\n\n334\n00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.050\nparagraph level formatting\nof that particular text.\n\n335\n00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:08.420\nSo, just know that you're not\nreally selecting cells and\n\n336\n00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:13.150\nformatting the cells individually,\nit's only the information inside of it.\n\n337\n00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:17.291\nBut you do have some other limited\nformatting with some styles,\n\n338\n00:20:17.291 --> 00:20:21.734\nto where you could go ahead and\ndo like a two tone or a light banded for\n\n339\n00:20:21.734 --> 00:20:25.830\nthe entire table but you see then\nit takes the table borders off.\n\n340\n00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.960\nSo you can put in tables,\nyou can add information into it.\n\n341\n00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.620\nYou can do some merging and\nsplitting of your cells but\n\n342\n00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:39.950\nnot much past that if you're\na very tabular type of person and\n\n343\n00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.070\nhave used tables in other applications.\n\n344\n00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:47.410\nSo it's there, just not as fluid.\n\n345\n00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:48.200\nWe'll just go with that.\n\n346\n00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.440\n&gt;&gt; Not as fluid.\n\n347\n00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.240\nNow Vonne, correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n348\n00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.590\nWe have a few other things but we're kind\nof getting near the end of this episode.\n\n349\n00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:58.020\nShould we go ahead and\nmake it a part three?\n\n350\n00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.780\n&gt;&gt; We're going to go for that trace right\nthere because we're going to talk about\n\n351\n00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.250\ncopying and pasting from other\napplications because sometimes I don't\n\n352\n00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:09.170\nalways want to type it all in myself if\nsomebody's already done it for me so.\n\n353\n00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:10.770\nWe'll go over those options as well.\n\n354\n00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.910\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm a lazy person,\nthat sounds like a great deal to me but\n\n355\n00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:16.830\njust real quick,\nyou're a hockey fan, right?\n\n356\n00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:17.370\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n357\n00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.200\n&gt;&gt; So three, that's a hat trick, right?\n\n358\n00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:20.990\nAm I wrong?\n\n359\n00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.500\n&gt;&gt; I'm beaming with pride right now.\n\n360\n00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.200\nYes, we're going for that hat trick.\n\n361\n00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.643\n&gt;&gt; But\nwe are gonna have the Outlook hat trick so\n\n362\n00:21:28.643 --> 00:21:32.938\nyou should definitely join us back as we\nfinish up this message formatting but\n\n363\n00:21:32.938 --> 00:21:35.560\nwe're gonna go ahead and end this episode.\n\n364\n00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.570\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n365\n00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:39.201\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n366\n00:21:39.201 --> 00:21:41.383\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n367\n00:21:41.383 -->

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.157 --> 00:00:11.514\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and\n\n4\n00:00:11.514 --> 00:00:14.970\nwe're back with a part three\nof message formatting.\n\n5\n00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.750\nWell, you wanted to know a lot\nabout Outlook on the web,\n\n6\n00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.710\nand you're getting just that.\n\n7\n00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.340\nAnd well,\n\n8\n00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.210\nwe have a little more to talk about for\nformatting our actual messages, right?\n\n9\n00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.940\nAnd here to help us is Ms Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.890\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n\n11\n00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.440\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n12\n00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.660\nWe're going to continue on as\nyou say with our messaging and\n\n13\n00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.430\nI don't like to type a lot sometimes.\n\n14\n00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.290\nEspecially if it's already out there for\nme.\n\n15\n00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.830\nAnd, we're gonna talk\na lot about copying and\n\n16\n00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.670\npasting into our messages,\nin this episode.\n\n17\n00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.427\nAnd this is where, we talked a lot about\nin the other episodes, is where you're\n\n18\n00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:56.691\ngoing to run into some variations\nwhen working in different browsers.\n\n19\n00:00:56.691 --> 00:01:00.366\nAnd so I will demonstrate that with\nour Edge and Chrome comparison,\n\n20\n00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.760\nthat we were doing in\nsome of our other ones.\n\n21\n00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.852\nSo if you haven't checked those out,\ndefinitely go back.\n\n22\n00:01:04.852 --> 00:01:07.590\nSo but we are going for\na hat trick, like he said.\n\n23\n00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.235\nSo we're gonna go into part three\nwith our messages, let's go.\n\n24\n00:01:12.235 --> 00:01:15.270\n[LAUGH] So I have Joey's email up, and\n\n25\n00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.690\nI actually have a couple\nother tabs open across this.\n\n26\n00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.199\nBecause where we are going to\nbe getting our information from.\n\n27\n00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.410\nLet's say we have a Word document\nthat has a bunch of text that's\n\n28\n00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.890\nalready typed out for us.\n\n29\n00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.070\nAnd that's what I want my message to be.\n\n30\n00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.510\nOr maybe I have something in Excel.\n\n31\n00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.650\nOr maybe there's something in\na website that I need to copy and\n\n32\n00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.220\npaste into my messages.\n\n33\n00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.127\nSo we're gonna go across those different\noptions, and throwing out those hey,\n\n34\n00:01:41.127 --> 00:01:45.963\nthat's a little different than that,\nand hm, that's not carrying over, and\n\n35\n00:01:45.963 --> 00:01:46.849\ngo from here.\n\n36\n00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:51.846\nSo I have OneDrive account with\nthis Office 365 subscription, and\n\n37\n00:01:51.846 --> 00:01:56.348\nI do have some text documents and\nsome Excel documents in here.\n\n38\n00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:59.910\nAnd I actually have this opened\nover here in this other tab.\n\n39\n00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.830\nSo this is the Alicetext.docx.\n\n40\n00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.320\nThat's a mouthful right there [LAUGH].\n\n41\n00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.520\nAnd this is the one of Word online.\n\n42\n00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.780\nSo scrolling down I just wanted to show\nyou that there is a paragraph in here that\n\n43\n00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.390\nhas some of that local formatting, or\njust character formatting we'll call it.\n\n44\n00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.640\nThat's what we'll call it,\nbecause that's what it is.\n\n45\n00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.910\nBut we have it here.\n\n46\n00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.509\nI also have the same document opened in my\n\n47\n00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:32.522\nlocally installed version of Word as well.\n\n48\n00:02:32.522 --> 00:02:34.330\nWhy do you think I'm doing that?\n\n49\n00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.430\nBecause I'm gonna show you just\na little bit of differences of\n\n50\n00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.970\ncopying from one place, and then copying\nfrom another and what to do with it.\n\n51\n00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.556\nAnd then how to control our paste options.\n\n52\n00:02:46.556 --> 00:02:51.510\nLet's jump back down into Joey's mail and\nstart a new message.\n\n53\n00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.990\nWe're not gonna,\nwe could address it to somebody\n\n54\n00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.270\neven though I don't know if we're\nactually going to send it just yet.\n\n55\n00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.520\nWe'll come down into the message body.\n\n56\n00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.580\nDon't forget that subject line.\n\n57\n00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.510\nYou know what, I sometimes do that.\n\n58\n00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.540\nYou don't wanna send a message\nwith no subject line.\n\n59\n00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.646\nI've gotten that quite a few times and\npeople are like, mm, well,\n\n60\n00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:10.618\nI guess we don't have\nany subjects [LAUGH].\n\n61\n00:03:10.618 --> 00:03:13.210\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know what I do when I\nget a message with no subject line?\n\n62\n00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.820\nI assume it's spam, mark it as spam,\nthrow it away, and well,\n\n63\n00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.590\nI don't actually do that.\n\n64\n00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.503\nBut a lot of times I won't even read it,\nor\n\n65\n00:03:20.503 --> 00:03:24.028\nit'll get kind of pushed down after\nthings that don't have subject lines.\n\n66\n00:03:24.028 --> 00:03:27.856\nSo always put subject lines in there,\ncuz if you're spending all this time\n\n67\n00:03:27.856 --> 00:03:31.712\nto copy and paste from appropriate\nsources, you want somebody to read it.\n\n68\n00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:34.554\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes,\nthat's kind of the email etiquette,\n\n69\n00:03:34.554 --> 00:03:37.060\nand having a subject line that\nactually means something.\n\n70\n00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.985\nNot just hi,\ncuz if I'm trying to find something,\n\n71\n00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:43.533\nit's probably good to have\na nice descriptive subject line.\n\n72\n00:03:43.533 --> 00:03:46.735\nBut copy and paste or copy and\npaste sounds good to me, and\n\n73\n00:03:46.735 --> 00:03:50.000\nwe'll jump down into our message body.\n\n74\n00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.490\nSo I want to get the text\nout of the document.\n\n75\n00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.810\nLet's start with a local copy of Word.\n\n76\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.394\nAnd down, down, down,\nthere's nothing else to do.\n\n77\n00:03:59.394 --> 00:04:03.410\nLet's select the text that I want to copy.\n\n78\n00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.500\nWe can right click, we can control C.\n\n79\n00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.360\nI'm gonna right click so\nyou can see me doing this.\n\n80\n00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.460\nAnd then I'm going to have that ready\nto go on my clipboard, as it's called.\n\n81\n00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.905\nWe'll come down over to my message,\nand I can right click and I can paste.\n\n82\n00:04:18.905 --> 00:04:23.468\nNow notice here that the formatting\nthat was with that text,\n\n83\n00:04:23.468 --> 00:04:27.851\nthe red and the larger text,\nthe italicized purple text,\n\n84\n00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:33.412\nis coming over into here, and you also\nget something known as a smart tag.\n\n85\n00:04:33.412 --> 00:04:37.701\nRemember this is where we have\n\n86\n00:04:37.701 --> 00:04:42.740\nthose assisted technologies.\n\n87\n00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.620\nThere you go.\n\n88\n00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.192\nI did it right.\n\n89\n00:04:44.192 --> 00:04:46.250\nI could see it, you were like,\nI'm not gonna tell you.\n\n90\n00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.342\nI'm gonna let you do it yourself.\n\n91\n00:04:47.342 --> 00:04:50.368\n&gt;&gt; No I was going to let you flounder and\nI would come in and\n\n92\n00:04:50.368 --> 00:04:52.665\nswoop in and save you at the last moment.\n\n93\n00:04:52.665 --> 00:04:53.890\nI wouldn't let you go down in flames.\n\n94\n00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.209\nBut you got it, I'm very proud of you.\n\n95\n00:04:58.209 --> 00:04:59.947\n&gt;&gt; My oracle powers came out there too and\n\n96\n00:04:59.947 --> 00:05:02.430\nI could just kinda reach it\nout of your brain so [LAUGH].\n\n97\n00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.883\nSo, I have this here and\n\n98\n00:05:03.883 --> 00:05:07.900\nthis is also very common across\nall of our Office product as well.\n\n99\n00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.839\nOf paste options,\nthey are not as extensive if you\n\n100\n00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:18.270\nare using Word or\na local copy of any of these products.\n\n101\n00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.369\nBut it does have the ones of,\npaste as is P.\n\n102\n00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:25.975\n[LAUGH] Just straight up paste like I did,\nI pasted the text.\n\n103\n00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:31.187\nBut then there's also ones where\nI have paste simple HTML and\n\n104\n00:05:31.187 --> 00:05:33.750\nI also have paste as text.\n\n105\n00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.790\nAnd this one where I usually like to\ngo to a lot, because a lot of times,\n\n106\n00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.100\nI don't want it to retain\nthe formatting that it came over with.\n\n107\n00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.140\nThis is especially true if\nI'm copying from a webpage,\n\n108\n00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.154\nwhich I'll show you in a little bit.\n\n109\n00:05:48.154 --> 00:05:53.749\nThat's why I remember HTML, right,\nwe're picking a webpage that has HTML and\n\n110\n00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:59.370\nwe're putting it into a web based email\nsystem that is also in HTML formatting.\n\n111\n00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.370\nAnd a lot of times like I don't need\nall of that extra stuff that comes\n\n112\n00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.608\nwith the language that I'm using,\nso I just want a text.\n\n113\n00:06:08.608 --> 00:06:13.337\nIf I click on this, it's just straight up\ntext and all the formatting gets stripped.\n\n114\n00:06:13.337 --> 00:06:16.980\nCuz maybe I wanna format it\ndifferently than where it came from.\n\n115\n00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.340\nSo those paste options can be really,\nreally helpful for\n\n116\n00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.865\ngetting rid of the things you don't want.\n\n117\n00:06:22.865 --> 00:06:27.157\nAnd just as a demonstration,\nsame paragraph, right?\n\n118\n00:06:27.157 --> 00:06:32.391\nSame document, but in the online version,\nif I, I love that one,\n\n119\n00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:37.285\nI can go ahead and right click and\nsay hey, use these shortcuts.\n\n120\n00:06:37.285 --> 00:06:39.528\nSo cuz I love shortcuts,\nbut when I'm demonstrating,\n\n121\n00:06:39.528 --> 00:06:42.550\nwhen I try to give you some visual\nindication of what I'm doing.\n\n122\n00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:49.042\nIf I then right click and paste,\nnotice that it did that already,\n\n123\n00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:53.895\nand it didn't wanna keep the red and\nthe purple.\n\n124\n00:06:53.895 --> 00:06:55.412\nAnd it just happens.\n\n125\n00:06:55.412 --> 00:06:59.883\nSo but at least if you're aware of it,\nand why you want it to happen,\n\n126\n00:06:59.883 --> 00:07:02.942\njust knowing that I can't\nget it out of this and\n\n127\n00:07:02.942 --> 00:07:07.030\nit might just be the formatting\nthat it is already created in.\n\n128\n00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.219\nAnd that's something that\nwhile I'm here copying and\n\n129\n00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:16.610\npasting from files that are in\na different format, such as PDFs.\n\n130\n00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.734\nThat's a big one.\n\n131\n00:07:17.734 --> 00:07:20.889\nI know a lot of people use PDF documents,\nand\n\n132\n00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:23.710\nI wanna get that information out of it.\n\n133\n00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.337\nI can see, [LAUGH] look at Justin.\n\n134\n00:07:26.337 --> 00:07:28.785\n&gt;&gt; It is all kinds of bad.\n\n135\n00:07:28.785 --> 00:07:31.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is, Ican't tell you.\n\n136\n00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.690\nI've spent, I think the most that I've\nspent on that is probably about an hour,\n\n137\n00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.350\njust going, I don't understand\nwhat you're trying to paste.\n\n138\n00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.560\nI just want this paragraph of text,\n\n139\n00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.330\nI should have just typed it at that point,\nbut I was determined.\n\n140\n00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.460\nI'm gonna right click, copy, paste.\n\n141\n00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.420\nPDFs are a tricky subject.\n\n142\n00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.750\n&gt;&gt; They are, and it's funny because\nI saw his head goes like this and\n\n143\n00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.444\ngoes [SOUND] [LAUGH], like gosh, yeah.\n\n144\n00:07:55.444 --> 00:07:58.087\nAnd the thing is because\nof the way the PDFs work,\n\n145\n00:07:58.087 --> 00:08:01.389\nit's like they're translating\nit into that PDF language.\n\n146\n00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:06.217\nIt also talks about the authoring product,\nor the authoring application that it was\n\n147\n00:08:06.217 --> 00:08:10.300\nmade in originally, in its native format,\nbefore it came out as a PDF.\n\n148\n00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.951\nLet's say it was made in InDesign,\nor it was made in Illustrator, and\n\n149\n00:08:13.951 --> 00:08:16.653\nto you,\nit just looks like just regular old text.\n\n150\n00:08:16.653 --> 00:08:21.012\nBut you try and copy and paste it, and\nit is just doing all sorts of wrongs, and\n\n151\n00:08:21.012 --> 00:08:22.368\njust this weird stuff.\n\n152\n00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:26.441\nAnd there's boxes everywhere, and\nyou don't understand why it's doing it,\n\n153\n00:08:26.441 --> 00:08:27.728\nit's just the way it is.\n\n154\n00:08:27.728 --> 00:08:31.241\nNow if it was created in Word,\nmade in SimpleText, and then made as PDF,\n\n155\n00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:32.808\nyou might be able to get it okay.\n\n156\n00:08:32.808 --> 00:08:37.369\nA lot of times, what you do when\nyou're coping out of PDFs is,\n\n157\n00:08:37.369 --> 00:08:41.160\neach line within a paragraph\nbecomes its own paragraph.\n\n158\n00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.940\nSo, there is a hard return\nafter each of end-of-line, and\n\n159\n00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:50.400\nit breaks up your text in these weird\nways, and it can be very, very confusing.\n\n160\n00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.195\nSo going from Office\nproduct to Office product,\n\n161\n00:08:53.195 --> 00:08:57.260\nyou're usually gonna have\na pretty decent time with that.\n\n162\n00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.232\nEven sometimes with that,\nit can get a little wonky, too.\n\n163\n00:08:59.232 --> 00:09:04.434\nBut just know that it can get you\ninto some, I don't understand\n\n164\n00:09:04.434 --> 00:09:09.550\nwhy you're not doing it the way\nI want it to, it's just text.\n\n165\n00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:14.910\nIt doesn't see it that way,\nin whatever format you're working with.\n\n166\n00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.470\nSometimes pasting it into\na like a simple editor,\n\n167\n00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.420\nlike Notepad, or into just a plain text\neditor, to kind of strip it all out.\n\n168\n00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.710\nI know, that's a little trick that\nI've always done with a lot of stuff.\n\n169\n00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.770\nGet in there, then take all\nthe Enter marks out of it and\n\n170\n00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:33.970\nthen copy it from there, and paste it\ninto my Word document, or into my email.\n\n171\n00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:38.513\nI do that a lot, so it's just something\nthat you would need to know of\n\n172\n00:09:38.513 --> 00:09:43.240\nuncommon file types, can give you\nsome weird stuff going over there.\n\n173\n00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.927\nNow, copying from a web page,\nand I'm going to, you know what,\n\n174\n00:09:47.927 --> 00:09:52.302\nlet's just start over, just for\nfun, we'll go over here.\n\n175\n00:09:52.302 --> 00:09:58.204\nI wanna paste some information from,\nlet's say, ITProTV.\n\n176\n00:09:58.204 --> 00:10:02.506\nThis is a website that I'd like\nto get some information from,\n\n177\n00:10:02.506 --> 00:10:07.900\ncuz this Engaging Courses, I really\nlike this little blurb of information.\n\n178\n00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.164\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and select it.\n\n179\n00:10:09.164 --> 00:10:13.514\nI am selecting from the bottom because I\nwant to get everything that's in here, for\n\n180\n00:10:13.514 --> 00:10:15.700\nthis particular demonstration.\n\n181\n00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.450\nSo I'm just gonna click,\n\n182\n00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:20.260\nhold, and drag up, and\nget this whole chunk of information.\n\n183\n00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:26.690\nI'll go ahead and right-click and\nCopy, get that into my clipboard,\n\n184\n00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:30.670\ncome over into my message, and then paste.\n\n185\n00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.910\nAnd that doesn't look really\nlike what this looks like.\n\n186\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:40.870\nDo you see how the text looks different,\nthe font, the placement of the image?\n\n187\n00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:44.326\nThat's what it did,\nnow why did it do that?\n\n188\n00:10:44.326 --> 00:10:48.305\nI really don't know, I mean,\nhow it translates the HTML, and\n\n189\n00:10:48.305 --> 00:10:51.708\nwhy it's not bringing over the text and\neverything?\n\n190\n00:10:51.708 --> 00:10:53.077\nWell I mean, I do know a little bit,\n\n191\n00:10:53.077 --> 00:10:56.054\nbecause there's something known as CSS,\nwhich is Cascading Style Sheets,\n\n192\n00:10:56.054 --> 00:10:58.226\nof how it's actually formatting\nthe text that you see.\n\n193\n00:10:58.226 --> 00:11:01.424\nAnd there's Global Style Sheets and,\nIn-line Style Sheets.\n\n194\n00:11:01.424 --> 00:11:05.368\nAnd if you're glazing over right now,\nI'll leave it to Justin,\n\n195\n00:11:05.368 --> 00:11:07.538\njust handwave right on over there.\n\n196\n00:11:07.538 --> 00:11:09.739\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just imagine, [SOUND] and\n\n197\n00:11:09.739 --> 00:11:13.909\nthen onward we go, but I can provide\na little bit of insight there.\n\n198\n00:11:13.909 --> 00:11:18.207\nAlso, when you're selecting the browser,\nyou're not necessarily selecting from\n\n199\n00:11:18.207 --> 00:11:21.200\nthe interface,\nthe underlying style sheets all the time.\n\n200\n00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.425\nSo that's being applied, but\nyou're only selecting what you're seeing.\n\n201\n00:11:25.425 --> 00:11:29.880\nAnd formatting, even though you're like,\nthat's what I see, gets a little tricky.\n\n202\n00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:34.727\nYou think of it as a data type thing,\nyou're grabbing just the data aspect,\n\n203\n00:11:34.727 --> 00:11:39.308\nand not necessarily the presentation\nof the data, in all capacities.\n\n204\n00:11:39.308 --> 00:11:43.570\nYeah, you had the links, but those\nare one of the things that carries over.\n\n205\n00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.690\nSo it can get a little wonky from\nbrowsers, I've had that issue as well.\n\n206\n00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:50.610\n&gt;&gt; And also, depending on the website that\nyou're on and how the page is coded if\n\n207\n00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.944\nyou're selecting what you think\nis just a picture and some text?\n\n208\n00:11:53.944 --> 00:11:57.563\nYou might see all these like tables and\nthings that the programmer,\n\n209\n00:11:57.563 --> 00:12:01.803\nI wouldn't say programmer, the coder,\nor whoever built that website or\n\n210\n00:12:01.803 --> 00:12:04.380\nhowever it is, it's all built in tables.\n\n211\n00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.704\nAnd so you might get some extra things,\nthat you don't even see,\n\n212\n00:12:07.704 --> 00:12:10.735\ninto it when you come in,\nthat's not supposed to be there.\n\n213\n00:12:10.735 --> 00:12:16.670\nSo again, just knowing those\nkind of nuances is good to go.\n\n214\n00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.752\nLet's come over here to Justin,\nbecause I wanted, just for\n\n215\n00:12:19.752 --> 00:12:22.395\nfun, select that same\namount of text in here.\n\n216\n00:12:22.395 --> 00:12:25.730\nWe'll go ahead and copy it,\nI just did a Ctrl+C.\n\n217\n00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:30.120\nCome over to Justin who's using Chrome,\ninto a new message, and\n\n218\n00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.200\nI'm gonna go ahead and paste.\n\n219\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.611\nAnd well, look at that,\nthis one went ahead and\n\n220\n00:12:34.611 --> 00:12:38.440\nused, it even has the background\ncolor of that h1 tag.\n\n221\n00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:44.513\nSorry, h1 is a heading, it might be an h1,\nit might be an h2 or an h3.\n\n222\n00:12:45.524 --> 00:12:48.890\n[LAUGH] It's text, but\nit kept the centering,\n\n223\n00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.959\nit kept the green text,\nit kept the background colors.\n\n224\n00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:56.590\nWhy did this, I did the same thing?\n\n225\n00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:01.420\nIt's just those browsers, and\nthis is Chrome versus Edge.\n\n226\n00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:07.490\nYou're always gonna get those differences,\nbut knowing it is half the battle.\n\n227\n00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.790\nAnd you do have your paste options,\n\n228\n00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.340\njust like you did from\nthe selecting of the text in Word.\n\n229\n00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.226\nIf I click on here,\na little bit behind my head right there.\n\n230\n00:13:16.226 --> 00:13:21.443\nBut you can see, that if I didn't want\nsome of that extra-ness that comes over,\n\n231\n00:13:21.443 --> 00:13:24.222\nand especially pacing out from a web page.\n\n232\n00:13:24.222 --> 00:13:27.976\nI'll tend to say, I just want the text,\na lot of times that's all I really want.\n\n233\n00:13:27.976 --> 00:13:31.452\nI just want the information\nto come into the web page.\n\n234\n00:13:31.452 --> 00:13:35.613\nAnd then of course,\nI could throw in the hyperlink, like we\n\n235\n00:13:35.613 --> 00:13:40.536\ndid in the Part Two of this Formatting\nMessage Body series of episodes.\n\n236\n00:13:40.536 --> 00:13:43.750\nAnd go from there, so\nat least they know where it comes from.\n\n237\n00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:50.056\nAnother thing that I wanted\nto cover was screenshots.\n\n238\n00:13:50.056 --> 00:13:53.410\nBecause many times,\nsay you're in a networked environment.\n\n239\n00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:58.970\nAnd you're telling your IT department, I'm\nhaving this error, something's happening.\n\n240\n00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:00.800\nAnd they're like,\ncan you send me a screenshot?\n\n241\n00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:07.116\nWell if you're only in the Microsoft,\nwell, what are we doing?\n\n242\n00:14:07.116 --> 00:14:08.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Outlook for Web.\n\n243\n00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n244\n00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.284\n&gt;&gt; You know sometimes I\n\n245\n00:14:10.284 --> 00:14:13.266\nask myself that also,\nI'm like, how did I get here?\n\n246\n00:14:13.266 --> 00:14:15.455\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well it's like,\nokay, we're on Outlook, but\n\n247\n00:14:15.455 --> 00:14:17.440\nthen that's all part of the Office,\nand it is a Microsoft product.\n\n248\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.830\nAnd I'm like, wait, yes,\nokay, it's all of the above.\n\n249\n00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:25.400\nSo if this is the only\nversion of Mail that I have,\n\n250\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.800\nI don't have the Insert Screenshot,\nwhich is super handy\n\n251\n00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.610\nin your locally installed\nversions of your Office products.\n\n252\n00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.590\nI love that button, but how can I get it?\n\n253\n00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:41.620\nIf you're in a Microsoft Windows operating\nsystem, you can use the snipping tool.\n\n254\n00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.788\nNot sure how many of you know of\nthis lovely tool, it's fantastic.\n\n255\n00:14:44.788 --> 00:14:48.970\nSo if I wanted to use the snipping tool to\nsay, I'm going to minimize some of this.\n\n256\n00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.808\nCuz maybe there's something\nweird going on my desktop, or\n\n257\n00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:55.780\nI had an error message that popped up,\nand I need to get that little piece.\n\n258\n00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.354\nComing down here to your search,\nyou can type in S-N-I-P.\n\n259\n00:14:59.354 --> 00:15:03.083\nAnd it brings up your search\nto find the snipping tool,\n\n260\n00:15:03.083 --> 00:15:06.987\nwhich will allow you to take\nlittle snips of your screen.\n\n261\n00:15:06.987 --> 00:15:10.603\nAnd no matter,\nwhatever you have up on your screen,\n\n262\n00:15:10.603 --> 00:15:15.585\nyou can click on the New button, and\nthen be able to grab a piece of it, and\n\n263\n00:15:15.585 --> 00:15:17.900\ndo stuff with it really quickly.\n\n264\n00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.641\nThe delay, this is a newer feature of it.\n\n265\n00:15:19.641 --> 00:15:22.169\nCuz a lot of the times,\nwhat I'm trying to do is,\n\n266\n00:15:22.169 --> 00:15:25.712\nI'm showing step-by-step\ninstructions on how to do something.\n\n267\n00:15:25.712 --> 00:15:27.820\nAnd I need to get it to where\nI can click the drop-down, and\n\n268\n00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:28.975\nshow the drop-down options.\n\n269\n00:15:28.975 --> 00:15:33.288\nWell, before they had this delay, I had to\ngo really fast and see if I can grab it.\n\n270\n00:15:33.288 --> 00:15:37.938\nWell, if I put the delay on for\ntwo seconds, I can get it set up, and\n\n271\n00:15:37.938 --> 00:15:41.360\nthen it gets ready for\nmy snapshot, I love that.\n\n272\n00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.662\nSo I'm gonna go to New,\nit takes me out, dims my screen.\n\n273\n00:15:43.662 --> 00:15:48.595\nNow I just click, hold, and\ndrag the area that I want to snap.\n\n274\n00:15:48.595 --> 00:15:52.022\nOnce I get into here,\nI could do some fun stuff,\n\n275\n00:15:52.022 --> 00:15:55.212\nlike maybe circle this, and what have you.\n\n276\n00:15:55.212 --> 00:15:59.020\nBut I need this to get into my message.\n\n277\n00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:03.350\nNow of course you could save it and\nthen attach the file to the message.\n\n278\n00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.580\nBut I really want it in the message.\n\n279\n00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.763\nJust copy and paste.\n\n280\n00:16:06.763 --> 00:16:10.509\nYou can Ctrl+C or Edit &gt; Copy.\n\n281\n00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:12.506\nCome back into my browser.\n\n282\n00:16:12.506 --> 00:16:13.628\nHere is my message.\n\n283\n00:16:13.628 --> 00:16:18.940\nCtrl+V or right-click, and\nthen I've got the screenshot right there.\n\n284\n00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.629\nSo, getting a screenshot into your\nmessage without having a button,\n\n285\n00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:24.324\nlittle work around is in there.\n\n286\n00:16:24.324 --> 00:16:27.147\nNow, if for some reason you're\non a Macintosh computer,\n\n287\n00:16:27.147 --> 00:16:31.250\nI don't know how many of you know about\nthese taking screenshots in a Mac.\n\n288\n00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:36.263\nYou could do Shift+Cmd+3, which would then\ntake a picture of your entire Desktop or\n\n289\n00:16:36.263 --> 00:16:41.087\nwhatever screens you have, and if you had\nmultiple monitors, I guess all of them.\n\n290\n00:16:41.087 --> 00:16:44.168\nBut, this same snipping tool,\nin Mac the equivalent is\n\n291\n00:16:44.168 --> 00:16:49.099\nif you do Cmd+Shift+4 it gets your little\ncrossair going and then you just drag, and\n\n292\n00:16:49.099 --> 00:16:53.961\nthen it makes a snapshot and automatically\nputs on your desktop, and it does date and\n\n293\n00:16:53.961 --> 00:16:56.865\ntime or at least,\nI'm pretty sure date and time.\n\n294\n00:16:56.865 --> 00:17:02.070\n&gt;&gt; I think it says, Snapshotdatetime.png\nand might have one other\n\n295\n00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:06.140\npiece of information, I don't recall right\noff hand what that information is though.\n\n296\n00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:06.720\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n\n297\n00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.294\nI love that,\nI use that all the time and if you,\n\n298\n00:17:09.294 --> 00:17:13.980\nyou're like why don't have it written down\nonce in show notes and really just search\n\n299\n00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:18.606\nfor screenshots Mac and it will give you\nall of those little pieces in there, okay.\n\n300\n00:17:18.606 --> 00:17:23.161\nI'm hopefully covering all of\nthe different areas that you're going\n\n301\n00:17:23.161 --> 00:17:27.714\nto need to insert content, by typing it,\nformatting it, copying and\n\n302\n00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:30.020\npasting it from multiple places.\n\n303\n00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:35.500\nKnowing those little nuances of our\nbrowsers, and things like that.\n\n304\n00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.740\nLast thing I'd like to leave you on,\nsince we are talking about images,\n\n305\n00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:45.340\nis what if you get a message that gives\nyou that download images messages?\n\n306\n00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.210\nAnd I don't know how many of\nyou have seen that before, but\n\n307\n00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.564\nI wanted to cover,\nlet me give you the example.\n\n308\n00:17:50.564 --> 00:17:54.781\nI have, it's actually my junk mail, so\n\n309\n00:17:54.781 --> 00:18:00.113\nif I come here to junk mail and\nI believe it is this one\n\n310\n00:18:00.113 --> 00:18:05.220\nright here, if I open this,\nit is right, okay.\n\n311\n00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.390\nThe message was,\nwait that's the save senders.\n\n312\n00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:08.870\nI think it's the other one.\n\n313\n00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.130\nLet's go back over here, one second.\n\n314\n00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.310\nHow about we go to here.\n\n315\n00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.715\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne, is it that little\nyellow bar that you're looking for?\n\n316\n00:18:15.715 --> 00:18:20.499\nBecause sometimes those messages they just\nkind of stack up and we overlook one.\n\n317\n00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:24.799\n&gt;&gt; It is [LAUGH], it totally is and\nis one of those, you know it's like,\n\n318\n00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:28.806\nit's right in front of you, so\nyou can't see and type things.\n\n319\n00:18:28.806 --> 00:18:33.113\nAnd I do work in so many different\nversions of online versions, local\n\n320\n00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:38.624\nversions, SMAC versions, PC versions, so I\ngot a little confused there for a second.\n\n321\n00:18:38.624 --> 00:18:41.257\nSo let me show you what I'm looking at,\nand\n\n322\n00:18:41.257 --> 00:18:45.574\nexplain to you what I'm trying to\nget around to because, like I said,\n\n323\n00:18:45.574 --> 00:18:50.208\ntalk about images here and we were\ninserting images into our message body.\n\n324\n00:18:50.208 --> 00:18:53.820\nHave you ever got an email\nlike this where it says,\n\n325\n00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.960\nhey you have content that\nthe images are not being shown.\n\n326\n00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:01.300\nCan I download this information for\n\n327\n00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.690\nyou and show you the content\nthat I can't show you right now?\n\n328\n00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.773\nWell, that is one, not what we were doing\nwhen we were entering the pictures,\n\n329\n00:19:10.773 --> 00:19:11.869\nnecessarily, okay.\n\n330\n00:19:11.869 --> 00:19:16.450\nWhat we're talking about here is,\npeople are going phishing.\n\n331\n00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:21.355\nSometimes, people will use this to\nbe able to have you click this and\n\n332\n00:19:21.355 --> 00:19:26.091\nit's going to go out to the internet and\ndownload information for\n\n333\n00:19:26.091 --> 00:19:29.383\nanother server and\nget those pictures in it.\n\n334\n00:19:29.383 --> 00:19:33.498\nAnd it could possibly be that it's\ninjecting some malicious code or\n\n335\n00:19:33.498 --> 00:19:34.880\nsome type of viruses.\n\n336\n00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.450\nAnd I am sure you have heard about this.\n\n337\n00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:40.020\nIt's all over the news a lot\nof times about ransom ware.\n\n338\n00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.760\nNow, this is not the exact same thing.\n\n339\n00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:46.270\nBut it's all about that, there is\nsecurity vulnerabilities out there that\n\n340\n00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:50.700\nwe should all just be aware of to\nmake sure we keep ourselves safe.\n\n341\n00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.856\nAnd what Justin was saying,\nhit that yellow black line and\n\n342\n00:19:52.856 --> 00:19:55.020\ndon't worry about the other\ngray ones right here.\n\n343\n00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.840\nThe show blacked content,\nthat's what I'm looking for.\n\n344\n00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:03.171\nIt might come up on a different message\nand if you're using a maybe lower\n\n345\n00:20:03.171 --> 00:20:07.789\ndifferent, [LAUGH] a different version\nof Outlook for the web, maybe the OWA\n\n346\n00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:12.437\nlike an actual, like web portal that\nis using to your Microsoft Exchanged.\n\n347\n00:20:12.437 --> 00:20:18.486\nRegardless of what or how the message\nis formatted, or what the verbage is,\n\n348\n00:20:18.486 --> 00:20:24.063\nit's saying hey, I'm blocking\ninformation that I see is asking me,\n\n349\n00:20:24.063 --> 00:20:27.580\nOutlook, and you to get that information.\n\n350\n00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.170\nSo you need to be a little\ncareful about this.\n\n351\n00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.232\nI'm not saying don't ever click on it.\n\n352\n00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:37.520\nThis right here, this is from\nthe Microsoft Online Services and\n\n353\n00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:42.580\nI can see it's addressed to Ronnie and\nit' also addressed to Don here,\n\n354\n00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:46.090\nand I know that those are people\nwithin my organization and\n\n355\n00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:49.900\nthose are the people that are on the\naccount that we pay for the subscription.\n\n356\n00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.520\nSo, I know that this is valid.\n\n357\n00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:56.010\nThis is not Microsoft with RRO.\n\n358\n00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:57.700\nThose are the things you need to look for.\n\n359\n00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:03.400\nIf you see something suspicious that,\nthis just doesn't look like it's valid.\n\n360\n00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.220\nThen I would say don't click on it.\n\n361\n00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.310\nOkay, but for this one,\nif I click on the Show Block content,\n\n362\n00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.480\nthe only thing that pops up is right here.\n\n363\n00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.830\nIt's the logo.\n\n364\n00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:16.300\nI've seen this with people's signature\nlines, to where it's saying hey, there's\n\n365\n00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.870\nblock content and I click it, and it's\njust their little picture and a signature.\n\n366\n00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:24.150\nBecause possibly how\nthey're set up with Group,\n\n367\n00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:25.810\nI'm not sure if Group policy\nis the way to say it.\n\n368\n00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:29.060\nBut like it's bigger on their network\nto where all of their signatures\n\n369\n00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:33.330\nare being stored somewhere else\nthan their local computer.\n\n370\n00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:37.515\nAnd then you get it sent and then,\nhey I need to download it from our server.\n\n371\n00:21:37.515 --> 00:21:39.945\nThat's where you start getting\ninto these things, okay.\n\n372\n00:21:39.945 --> 00:21:43.211\nSo, just be aware of it and\nalso know like I said,\n\n373\n00:21:43.211 --> 00:21:48.078\nyou inserting an image that Joey\npictured or copied screenshot from your\n\n374\n00:21:48.078 --> 00:21:52.945\nsniffing tool into your document,\ndoes not always mean that people that\n\n375\n00:21:52.945 --> 00:21:57.969\nyour sending it to are going to get the\nsame message because it's like apples and\n\n376\n00:21:57.969 --> 00:22:02.100\noranges, it's two different\nthings they are still fruit.\n\n377\n00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.100\nBut they come from different sources.\n\n378\n00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:09.210\nThey're still images, but how they\nare inserted into the email are different.\n\n379\n00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:13.130\nWe were embedding\nthe information into that file.\n\n380\n00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:18.070\nThese types of images are linked\nout to external sources and\n\n381\n00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:22.100\nparticularly out to websites or\nweb servers that you have to download\n\n382\n00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:28.330\nthe files to your computer or\nservice to be able to be visible.\n\n383\n00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:30.290\nSo just wanted to throw that in there.\n\n384\n00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:33.310\nJust a little bit about phishing and\nkeeping us safe and\n\n385\n00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:38.550\nunderstanding the difference\nbetween linked and embedded images.\n\n386\n00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:41.070\nAnd that is the end.\n\n387\n00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.959\nI am taking my hockey stick and\nI'm shooting that puck.\n\n388\n00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:46.080\nGoal?\n\n389\n00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.680\n&gt;&gt; Goal!\nAll right.\n\n390\n00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:53.570\nWe've completed our hat trick and\njust a quick aside, it is also, hey, it is\n\n391\n00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:58.170\nalso something to reduce bandwidth usage\nas well as to keep you from accidentally\n\n392\n00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:01.970\nseeing a lot of inappropriate content, if\nyou're getting hit with a bunch of spam.\n\n393\n00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:03.230\nSo, there's multiple uses there.\n\n394\n00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:06.650\nWe should always be aware who's sending\nthe message before we click that\n\n395\n00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:07.580\nget blocked content.\n\n396\n00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:08.550\nBut you know, Vonne,\n\n397\n00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:13.010\nI didn't know that the online version\nof Outlook had all these options.\n\n398\n00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:16.100\nBut we finally made it, so\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n399\n00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.990\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n400\n00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.930\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n401\n00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.759\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n402\n00:23:20.759 --> 00:23:26.358\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

I know, I just got all tongue tied\nabout how exited I am to be back here and\n\n13\n00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.580\ntalk about Outlook on the web.\n\n14\n00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.250\nYes, so we've gone over quite\na few different things so far.\n\n15\n00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.892\nWe've been talking about some basic\nemailing, with our cc and our bcc, we also\n\n16\n00:00:54.892 --> 00:00:59.831\ndid some formatting and now we're getting\ninto some more advanced email features.\n\n17\n00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:04.556\nAnd these are really more of like our\noptions that we have when we are composing\n\n18\n00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:08.407\na message, and some different\nthings that we could put on it for\n\n19\n00:01:08.407 --> 00:01:12.210\nthe recipients to know,\nhey this is really important.\n\n20\n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.070\nSo I'm gonna add a little exclamation\npoint to the subject line.\n\n21\n00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.860\nWell not really the subject line but\nthe actually importance of that email, so\n\n22\n00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.800\nyou can see that this is\nsomething very important.\n\n23\n00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.190\n&gt;&gt; You know it's not\nfiguratively speaking,\n\n24\n00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.120\nthere's actual exclamation\npoint that shows up.\n\n25\n00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe're gonna see the icon that shows up,\n\n26\n00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.450\nthat's hey, this is really important.\n\n27\n00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.160\nAnd then we're also\ngonna talk sensitivity.\n\n28\n00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.075\nHey, you really should treat this\nas a confidential information,\n\n29\n00:01:39.075 --> 00:01:41.740\nthat this is personal or\n\n30\n00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.870\nthat something about this you probably\nshouldn't be telling your friends, okay.\n\n31\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.822\nAnd then hey, can you also let me know\nthat you actually read this email?\n\n32\n00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:55.300\nSo we're gonna talk about receipts,\ndelivery receipts and read receipts.\n\n33\n00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.800\nSo we're gonna go into\nsome of those things.\n\n34\n00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.673\nNow we are talking about Outlook on\nthe web, so we're on our web application.\n\n35\n00:02:01.673 --> 00:02:07.390\nAnd while this is a web show, I am gonna\nshow you some comparing and contrasting\n\n36\n00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.270\nwith the Outlook locally installed, the\nOutlook 2016, so you can just get an idea.\n\n37\n00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.810\nBecause I know at least, for me maybe for\n\n38\n00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.910\nyou Daniel, I have my locally installed\nversion of the outlook on my Mac side.\n\n39\n00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.050\nBut then, I can also go ahead and\n\n40\n00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.300\nlog in to the web app when I'm\nnot on that particular computer.\n\n41\n00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.655\nSo, I use both all the time.\n\n42\n00:02:26.655 --> 00:02:29.252\n&gt;&gt; I'm the exact same way,\nwhen I'm sitting at my own computer,\n\n43\n00:02:29.252 --> 00:02:32.760\nguess what, I'm going to use\nthe locally installed client for\n\n44\n00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.020\nOutlook because it has every feature\nunder the sun that I can imagine.\n\n45\n00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.480\nBut when I'm not on my computer or\nI'm out and\n\n46\n00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.660\nabout somewhere, maybe I'm not\nconnected to my local network.\n\n47\n00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.614\nRight, you wanna make sure\nthings stay secure, I use OWA or\n\n48\n00:02:45.614 --> 00:02:47.988\nthe Outlook web access,\nas they use to call it.\n\n49\n00:02:47.988 --> 00:02:52.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's where,I mean and\nsome people only use the online version.\n\n50\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.340\nAnd that's why we have this\nentire show Outlook on the Web,\n\n51\n00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.680\ncuz some people never even\ntouch the local version.\n\n52\n00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.470\nSo if you're one of those people that,\nI'm never gonna do local anyways,\n\n53\n00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.870\nI at least wanted to show you the options.\n\n54\n00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.240\nCuz maybe as you as a recipient, that's\nwhere we're gonna get into a part two\n\n55\n00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.670\nof being on the receiving end of some\nof these features that you might not\n\n56\n00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.210\nhave to be able to use when you\ncompose a message in the Outlook for\n\n57\n00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.970\nWeb, but\nhow it's gonna be shown as you receive it.\n\n58\n00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.700\nSo we're just gonna kinda\ncover all bases and basics.\n\n59\n00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

And\n\n155\n00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:09.050\nit's probably a good idea to state inside\nof your employee handbook or something.\n\n156\n00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.160\nIf you're working in email, make sure that\nif it says confidential or sensitive, or\n\n157\n00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.385\nwhatever the case may be,\nthat you treat it in such a manner, so\n\n158\n00:08:16.385 --> 00:08:19.370\nthat they know that that has been defined,\nand they don't go, well,\n\n159\n00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.040\nto me sensitive meant this and\nto you it meant that.\n\n160\n00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.060\nAnd here we go back and forth.\n\n161\n00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:24.860\nThat's not gonna work.\n\n162\n00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.360\nYou need to clearly define those things,\n\n163\n00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.990\nso that when someone does\nuse this incorrectly,\n\n164\n00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.950\nyou can say it states very plainly right\nhere that what you did was not acceptable.\n\n165\n00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:34.923\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and, of course,\n\n166\n00:08:34.923 --> 00:08:37.964\nhow many of our organizations actually\nhave those types of policies?\n\n167\n00:08:37.964 --> 00:08:39.642\nIt really depends on where you work.\n\n168\n00:08:39.642 --> 00:08:43.928\nBut even if you want to set like\nan internal policy, if the people that you\n\n169\n00:08:43.928 --> 00:08:48.523\nwork with like, hey if I ever put this\nas confidential, do treat it that way.\n\n170\n00:08:48.523 --> 00:08:51.203\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n174\n00:08:59.362 --> 00:09:01.766\nI mean can send this to you and\nI can tell you, but\n\n175\n00:09:01.766 --> 00:09:03.665\nthen I'm gonna have to put you away.\n\n176\n00:09:03.665 --> 00:09:04.753\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n177\n00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:06.915\nWe'll put you in a hole somewhere\nthat no one will ever find you again.\n\n178\n00:09:06.915 --> 00:09:08.628\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just because you wanted to know what\n\n179\n00:09:08.628 --> 00:09:09.180\nwas in my email.\n\n180\n00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.801\nI mean, that's fine, we can do that.\n\n181\n00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:11.637\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n182\n00:09:11.637 --> 00:09:14.660\nyou can say that\nthe sensitivity level is there.\n\n183\n00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.108\nNow let's look at some\nof these other options.\n\n184\n00:09:16.108 --> 00:09:17.470\nThere's two other check boxes.\n\n185\n00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.230\nThere is request a delivery receipt and\nrequest a read receipt.\n\n186\n00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.440\nNotice it's a request.\n\n187\n00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.400\nI'm asking.\n\n188\n00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.695\nJust because you ask doesn't\nmean you gonna get it.\n\n189\n00:09:27.695 --> 00:09:29.675\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you're just asking for\n\n190\n00:09:29.675 --> 00:09:30.850\nthis information.\n\n191\n00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.150\nNow a delivery receipt, what is that?\n\n192\n00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:37.208\nThat is for\nyour server to know that it was delivered.\n\n193\n00:09:37.208 --> 00:09:41.992\nNow, as I'm saying your server and\nthen also the server of who\n\n194\n00:09:41.992 --> 00:09:46.134\nyou're sending it to,\nto send back, yup, I got it.\n\n195\n00:09:46.134 --> 00:09:50.649\nNow, and\nI think you know some of this here Daniel,\n\n196\n00:09:50.649 --> 00:09:55.070\nis that not all servers\neven do deliver receipts.\n\n197\n00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:58.641\nThey don't even acknowledge it and they\nwon't even, like they just won't do it.\n\n198\n00:09:58.641 --> 00:09:59.372\nI can't find the right word.\n\n199\n00:09:59.372 --> 00:10:03.209\nThey won't confine, not confine.\n\n200\n00:10:03.209 --> 00:10:04.633\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They don't recognize\n\n201\n00:10:04.633 --> 00:10:07.340\ndelivery receipts and so\nthey won't send it back to you.\n\n202\n00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.677\nYou as the sender to that recipient,\nthe recipient server doesn't send it back.\n\n203\n00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:12.705\nThey just ignore it.\n\n204\n00:10:12.705 --> 00:10:14.514\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; I'm wondering if it's also,\n\n205\n00:10:14.514 --> 00:10:17.908\nas long they don't receive some sort\nof error, that the email was sent and\n\n206\n00:10:17.908 --> 00:10:21.359\nno error comes back, because you send\nsomething, and you're looking for\n\n207\n00:10:21.359 --> 00:10:25.072\na response that it was delivered, that it\nmade it to where you were trying to go.\n\n208\n00:10:25.072 --> 00:10:27.791\nThey don't receive an error is\nsomething that it will still say, yeah,\n\n209\n00:10:27.791 --> 00:10:28.490\nit was delivered.\n\n210\n00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.230\n&gt;&gt; And we've actually gone over that in\nsome episodes where we've actually said,\n\n211\n00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.760\nall right well you got that,\nlike you know what, you got the kick back.\n\n212\n00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.540\nYou know it was undeliverable.\n\n213\n00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.722\nAnd there are some reasons\nwhy it didn't get back.\n\n214\n00:10:37.722 --> 00:10:41.890\nSo it's a little bit different here\nas in it wasn't necessarily an error,\n\n215\n00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:43.900\nit's just they ignored it.\n\n216\n00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.170\nAnd I mean that's just, all the things\nI've read, it's just some servers.\n\n217\n00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.840\nThey weren't specific on\nwhich servers they were.\n\n218\n00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.231\nIt's a possibility you\nwon't get anything back.\n\n219\n00:10:53.231 --> 00:10:56.345\n&gt;&gt; That's cuz they want you\nto use all Microsoft servers.\n\n220\n00:10:56.345 --> 00:10:58.951\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know which ones they are,\n\n221\n00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:00.151\nbut just in case-\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm emailing Justin within\n\n298\n00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.620\nthe Office Pro demo codes, Microsoft,\nso it's going to give me that.\n\n299\n00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.230\nIt says yep, there you go.\n\n300\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:08.260\nYour message has been delivered\nto Justin Timberlake.\n\n301\n00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.534\nSo I know it got to him.\n\n302\n00:14:11.534 --> 00:14:14.390\nSo there's another of like,\nI didn't get your email.\n\n303\n00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:18.865\nI have a delivery receipt\nthat says it was delivered.\n\n304\n00:14:18.865 --> 00:14:20.971\nBut, it's another one of like,\n\n305\n00:14:20.971 --> 00:14:24.444\nhow that end user has setup\nhow it receives your email.\n\n306\n00:14:24.444 --> 00:14:27.839\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it hit a stinking weird Outlook\nrule that caught it and deleted it, and\n\n307\n00:14:27.839 --> 00:14:29.227\nthey never even saw the thing.\n\n308\n00:14:29.227 --> 00:14:32.767\nThat's definitely possible, but\nyou're gonna have to go down that road and\n\n309\n00:14:32.767 --> 00:14:34.902\nfollow the bread trail and\nsee where it leads.\n\n310\n00:14:34.902 --> 00:14:36.270\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n180\n00:08:17.429 --> 00:08:18.606\n&gt;&gt; So it's from Justin.\n\n181\n00:08:18.606 --> 00:08:21.338\nI am Joey, I'm receiving this\ninformation from Justin.\n\n182\n00:08:21.338 --> 00:08:24.376\nIf I click Reply watch where\nit's going to be sent to.\n\n183\n00:08:24.376 --> 00:08:27.495\nThat's not Justin, that's Lance.\n\n184\n00:08:27.495 --> 00:08:30.900\n&gt;&gt; Unless Justin is starting\nwith an L nowadays.\n\n185\n00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.573\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n186\n00:08:31.573 --> 00:08:32.640\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure that's not Justin.\n\n187\n00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly [LAUGH] This is where\nhe made the message did that redirect.\n\n188\n00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.321\nThough in the local version those\noptions that we showed he went ahead and\n\n189\n00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:46.583\nsaid send replies to Lance Bass because\nLance is gonna be the one that's going to\n\n190\n00:08:46.583 --> 00:08:48.066\nbe taking up this project.\n\n191\n00:08:48.066 --> 00:08:49.504\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's from Justin so\n\n192\n00:08:49.504 --> 00:08:52.344\nit's like the big man said\nthat we're gonna do this but\n\n193\n00:08:52.344 --> 00:08:54.652\nI'm basically handling this off to Lance.\n\n194\n00:08:54.652 --> 00:08:56.623\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, due to the delegation.\n\n195\n00:08:56.623 --> 00:09:01.202\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] so that's why as\na recipient you might see that.\n\n196\n00:09:01.202 --> 00:09:03.895\nSo it can be really confusing and\n\n197\n00:09:03.895 --> 00:09:09.581\nthat's where I think I did say\nthis in the Outlook 2016 series,\n\n198\n00:09:09.581 --> 00:09:16.380\nI said make sure you explain this in\nthe body to people like, hey, I'm Justin.\n\n199\n00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.431\nI'm gonna go ahead and tell you to\ndo all these great things but, hey,\n\n200\n00:09:19.431 --> 00:09:21.862\nwhen you reply,\nyou're going to be replying to Lance,\n\n201\n00:09:21.862 --> 00:09:24.003\nbecause Lance is the organizer\nof this project.\n\n202\n00:09:24.003 --> 00:09:26.093\nYou wanna explain that in the body.\n\n203\n00:09:26.093 --> 00:09:30.442\n&gt;&gt; Not just why is coming from Justin and\ngoing to Lance when I hit eply.\n\n204\n00:09:30.442 --> 00:09:33.871\nNot making a whole lot of sense to\nme without that context, right?\n\n205\n00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:36.421\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and maybe like, and\ndon't include me in the reply.\n\n206\n00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:36.987\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n207\n00:09:36.987 --> 00:09:39.091\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm not gonna pay attention\nto it because I've delegated.\n\n208\n00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:39.792\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n209\n00:09:39.792 --> 00:09:41.627\n&gt;&gt; My responsibilities to other people.\n\n210\n00:09:41.627 --> 00:09:44.800\n[LAUGH] So, make sure you give\na little context in that.\n\n211\n00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.956\nSo there's what we can\ndo with the redirect.\n\n212\n00:09:47.956 --> 00:09:49.583\nAll right, Voting buttons.\n\n213\n00:09:49.583 --> 00:09:52.344\nNow, I will say I like Voting buttons.\n\n214\n00:09:52.344 --> 00:09:54.602\nI always say it's a really cute feature,\nokay?\n\n215\n00:09:54.602 --> 00:09:55.713\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It really is cute.\n\n216\n00:09:55.713 --> 00:09:56.914\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure Microsoft loves to hear that.\n\n217\n00:09:56.914 --> 00:09:59.348\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, yes,\n\n218\n00:09:59.348 --> 00:10:03.753\nthis adorable features that's\nvery Microsoft specific,\n\n219\n00:10:03.753 --> 00:10:07.904\nand it's also very Microsoft\nlocalization specific.\n\n220\n00:10:07.904 --> 00:10:11.183\nAnd then you can even go\nas far as Microsoft domain,\n\n221\n00:10:11.183 --> 00:10:16.650\nlike making sure all the same server\nbecause it's kind of specialty.\n\n222\n00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.366\nSo if you're sending this stuff\nwith voting buttons to people\n\n223\n00:10:20.366 --> 00:10:24.939\noutside your organization and also to\nlike Gmail and all that kind of stuff,\n\n224\n00:10:24.939 --> 00:10:27.095\nyou are not gonna get this feature.\n\n225\n00:10:27.095 --> 00:10:27.602\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n226\n00:10:27.602 --> 00:10:31.657\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so just know to use them\nsparingly, and well actually in the web\n\n227\n00:10:31.657 --> 00:10:36.429\nversion you can't create voting buttons\nanyway, so you won't be able to use it.\n\n228\n00:10:36.429 --> 00:10:40.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just stick to the web version,\nit won't trip you up on things, and\n\n229\n00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.323\ntempt you with things you can actually do.\n\n230\n00:10:42.323 --> 00:10:44.708\n&gt;&gt; But it is tempting because\nhere let's look at this.\n\n231\n00:10:44.708 --> 00:10:49.208\n&gt;&gt; All right, so now we have Justin who\ncreated voting buttons in his local\n\n232\n00:10:49.208 --> 00:10:54.083\ninstallation he wanna go ahead and said,\nthis is Justin, I wanna go ahead and\n\n233\n00:10:54.083 --> 00:10:57.533\ndo options of, go ahead and\nuse some voting buttons and\n\n234\n00:10:57.533 --> 00:11:02.346\nI can make custom ones and I can send it\nall out to everybody and I can track it.\n\n235\n00:11:02.346 --> 00:11:04.031\nIts actually a really cool feature, okay?\n\n236\n00:11:04.031 --> 00:11:07.162\nWatch the Outlook 2016 show,\nits pretty neat.\n\n237\n00:11:07.162 --> 00:11:08.172\nSo there, it's great.\n\n238\n00:11:08.172 --> 00:11:13.466\nSo lets go ahead and say that as Justin\nlocally and so I go ahead and create that\n\n239\n00:11:13.466 --> 00:11:18.781\nWell, what about people who don't use\nlocal versions of Outlook, right?\n\n240\n00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:25.590\nHow does he know that Justin, wait Joey,\nJoey over here is only using the web app?\n\n241\n00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.762\nSo, is he gonna be able to see it?\n\n242\n00:11:27.762 --> 00:11:29.892\nWell, actually, yeah.\n\n243\n00:11:29.892 --> 00:11:30.802\nBut it's really small.\n\n244\n00:11:30.802 --> 00:11:35.058\nSo look at this, so, this is the one\nthat says, this is, remember I'm Joey,\n\n245\n00:11:35.058 --> 00:11:37.903\nJustin made this and\nit says hey, do you like pizza?\n\n246\n00:11:37.903 --> 00:11:38.637\nPlease vote.\n\n247\n00:11:38.637 --> 00:11:40.954\nAnd I'm like vote, vote where?\n\n248\n00:11:40.954 --> 00:11:42.550\nWell, it says right.\n\n249\n00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.035\n&gt;&gt; Type in yes [LAUGH].\n\n250\n00:11:44.035 --> 00:11:46.508\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But look at that,\nit's so small.\n\n251\n00:11:46.508 --> 00:11:47.182\nRemember those status?\n\n252\n00:11:47.182 --> 00:11:48.465\n&gt;&gt;

You just can't create one,\nlike that has a voting structure.\n\n256\n00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:04.491\n&gt;&gt; Yes, as the receiver of a voting\nbuttons message, you can do it.\n\n257\n00:12:04.491 --> 00:12:09.430\nNow I'm saying can with a big\nasterisk on this one, okay?\n\n258\n00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:14.256\nSo, at the time of this recording\n[LAUGH] from my research,\n\n259\n00:12:14.256 --> 00:12:18.892\nso far Chrome is good,\nSafari is good on both Mac and PC.\n\n260\n00:12:18.892 --> 00:12:21.774\nWell, I guess Safari on PC\ndoesn't really played it.\n\n261\n00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:22.529\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n262\n00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:27.221\n&gt;&gt; All the ones that I have access to, it\nseemed to be working okay on Office 365,\n\n263\n00:12:27.221 --> 00:12:30.534\nI have not tested Firefox,\njust tell you that right now.\n\n264\n00:12:30.534 --> 00:12:32.757\nHaven't done like Opera and\nall of those things.\n\n265\n00:12:32.757 --> 00:12:34.821\nAnd it did work in the Edge, of course.\n\n266\n00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:36.318\n&gt;&gt; Right, that make sense.\n\n267\n00:12:36.318 --> 00:12:39.443\n&gt;&gt; I did not test IE,\nwhatever version of IE they're on.\n\n268\n00:12:39.443 --> 00:12:40.642\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Yeah.\n\n269\n00:12:40.642 --> 00:12:41.631\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, something like that.\n\n270\n00:12:41.631 --> 00:12:44.871\nSo my thing here is it\nmight not always work.\n\n271\n00:12:44.871 --> 00:12:48.252\n&gt;&gt; As Justin says, not Justin Timberlake,\nbut Justin here says,\n\n272\n00:12:48.252 --> 00:12:49.511\nyour mileage may vary.\n\n273\n00:12:49.511 --> 00:12:52.898\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah so just know that it\n\n274\n00:12:52.898 --> 00:12:58.991\nmight not go all across the board, even\nif you're emailing people on Microsoft.\n\n275\n00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:02.566\nAnd then the other thing that I noticed\nis that on the Outlook.com one,\n\n276\n00:13:02.566 --> 00:13:04.960\nthe recipients they don't\neven get an option.\n\n277\n00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.121\nThey do not see,\nthey do not get a status bar.\n\n278\n00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:08.273\nSo actually, here let me show you.\n\n279\n00:13:08.273 --> 00:13:13.941\nIf I come over here to\nmy Von OPDC account.\n\n280\n00:13:13.941 --> 00:13:15.712\nThis is one that, can you see voting?\n\n281\n00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:18.805\nAnd Justin didn't email me Von.\n\n282\n00:13:18.805 --> 00:13:19.317\n&gt;&gt;

Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's something a little bit different.\n\n287\n00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.606\nSo just know it might not go everywhere.\n\n288\n00:13:30.606 --> 00:13:35.843\nBut it is kinda cute and I could go ahead\nand vote yes and then it went ahead and\n\n289\n00:13:35.843 --> 00:13:39.853\nI could reply to that as well and\ngo on to so on and so forth.\n\n290\n00:13:39.853 --> 00:13:41.471\nSo, it does, right there.\n\n291\n00:13:41.471 --> 00:13:44.951\nYou've chosen to reply,\nyes, yes, okay cool.\n\n292\n00:13:44.951 --> 00:13:45.772\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt;

I would say, a cool heads prevail and\nyou should type the right thing.\n\n404\n00:19:21.474 --> 00:19:23.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd this is where in the local version,\n\n405\n00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.813\nwe talked about recalling a message\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n406\n00:19:25.813 --> 00:19:28.333\n&gt;&gt; You can recall it, doesn't always work.\n\n407\n00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:31.401\n&gt;&gt; And as the the damage already is\nkinda done at that point, right?\n\n408\n00:19:31.401 --> 00:19:32.018\n&gt;&gt; And it could be.\n\n409\n00:19:32.018 --> 00:19:35.730\nIt's one of those it has to be\nwhere they had an open did.\n\n410\n00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.465\nAll that kinda stuff\nthat doesn't always work.\n\n411\n00:19:37.465 --> 00:19:40.847\nSo the moral of story is don't send it.\n\n412\n00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:48.260\nBut if just in case there is in the web\nversion, you don't have recall message.\n\n413\n00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.846\nSo what do I have.\n\n414\n00:19:49.846 --> 00:19:54.909\nBut you do have an option to\ndelay your sending of an email\n\n415\n00:19:54.909 --> 00:20:00.636\nby a certain time increment, and\ngives you the option to undo.\n\n416\n00:20:00.636 --> 00:20:02.733\n&gt;&gt;

Right, cuz I know who it is coming\nfrom, we are having a conversation.\n\n197\n00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nI tend to personally like that option off.\n\n198\n00:09:02.515 --> 00:09:06.000\nAnd especially in the web version,\nsince remember I said there is only what,\n\n199\n00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.475\nyou only get one address, notice\nthere's no options to create multiples.\n\n200\n00:09:09.475 --> 00:09:13.220\nLemme just jump over really\nquickly to JT's local account.\n\n201\n00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.560\nSo you can see here, that this is where\nwhen he's, I'm in the local version, and\n\n202\n00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.940\nwe come over here to signatures.\n\n203\n00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.930\nI'm just gonna jump into\nthe signatures box.\n\n204\n00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.980\nLook at, I could have a whole\nbunch of different signatures.\n\n205\n00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.650\nI can create a simple one, a fancy one.\n\n206\n00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.170\nI can create a business card one.\n\n207\n00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.920\nSo way more options with\nsignatures in the local version.\n\n208\n00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.546\nAnd then notice right here, I can have\na different type of signature for\n\n209\n00:09:38.546 --> 00:09:40.098\nreplies and forwards.\n\n210\n00:09:40.098 --> 00:09:41.898\nAnd this is where I have\nit set up to where,\n\n211\n00:09:41.898 --> 00:09:44.779\nnew messages they get my business card,\nwhere they can go ahead and\n\n212\n00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:47.170\nadd to their contacts, and\nall that kind of fun stuff.\n\n213\n00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.476\nBut then when we start doing replies,\nit just goes to the simple one,\n\n214\n00:09:50.476 --> 00:09:52.647\nthe one where it has\njust Justin Timberlake.\n\n215\n00:09:52.647 --> 00:09:53.522\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; He's the CEO.\n\n216\n00:09:53.522 --> 00:09:54.416\nWhat else is he?\n\n217\n00:09:54.416 --> 00:09:56.520\nWay more options here, okay?\n\n218\n00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.100\nSo that's kind of a neat thing.\n\n219\n00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.450\nThe other reason why I wanted to\ncome back over to here, was because,\n\n220\n00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:04.600\nlook this is a new message.\n\n221\n00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.440\nThis is his signature that\nI've went ahead and done.\n\n222\n00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:14.161\nWe don't need to set the draft, so\nlook at the web version for JT.\n\n223\n00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:15.232\nSo we're still in JT.\n\n224\n00:10:15.232 --> 00:10:20.212\nI go ahead and make a new message,\nthere is not the same options right here.\n\n225\n00:10:20.212 --> 00:10:22.603\nI do not have any signature that I have,\n\n226\n00:10:22.603 --> 00:10:26.922\nbecause I want to emphasize\nthe point they're not connected.\n\n227\n00:10:26.922 --> 00:10:28.635\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n228\n00:10:28.635 --> 00:10:30.857\nAll right, and\nthat's where I want to come over here.\n\n229\n00:10:30.857 --> 00:10:35.606\nThese links are in the show notes but\nthis is on the, where am I?\n\n230\n00:10:35.606 --> 00:10:39.710\nI'm on the Microsoft help ones on\ncreating and adding a signature.\n\n231\n00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.528\nNow this is applying to Outlook 2016,\nbut I wanted to point this one out.\n\n232\n00:10:43.528 --> 00:10:46.090\nIf you have a Mirco, what is that?\n\n233\n00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:50.610\nRead Vonne, online account [LAUGH],\nthey're not connected.\n\n234\n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.660\nYou will need to create\na signature in each.\n\n235\n00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.488\n&gt;&gt; I mean I guess that makes sense,\nbecause if you're working with Outlook as\n\n236\n00:10:57.488 --> 00:11:01.621\na client inside of a company, it's\ntypically connected to an exchange server,\n\n237\n00:11:01.621 --> 00:11:04.120\nwhich is their email service, right?\n\n238\n00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.600\nAnd that's where that signature is going\nto be stored, is either on that client or\n\n239\n00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.540\non that server.\n\n240\n00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.421\nSo once you jump out to the web,\nit's saying, well,\n\n241\n00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:14.482\nwe're kind of giving you web access.\n\n242\n00:11:14.482 --> 00:11:15.322\nIt might be a different service.\n\n243\n00:11:15.322 --> 00:11:15.912\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n244\n00:11:15.912 --> 00:11:17.691\nit might not have all the bells and\nwhistles.\n\n245\n00:11:17.691 --> 00:11:20.552\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so it's nice that they just\nkind of put it right out there for you,\n\n246\n00:11:20.552 --> 00:11:22.070\nlike they're not gonna be the same.\n\n247\n00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.834\nSo I could send you one from my local,\nhave a completely different signature.\n\n248\n00:11:25.834 --> 00:11:27.474\n&gt;&gt; I can't tell you how many\ntimes I got this phone call.\n\n249\n00:11:27.474 --> 00:11:30.026\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where's my signature?\n\n250\n00:11:30.026 --> 00:11:34.030\nIt's not there, cuz you're using a WA or\nthe web app or Office 365.\n\n251\n00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.770\nWe're like, well,\nI made it in the Outlook thing.\n\n252\n00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.620\nWell yeah, you did, but\nthat's not how this works.\n\n253\n00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:39.363\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n254\n00:11:39.363 --> 00:11:40.370\nthey don't talk to each other.\n\n255\n00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.410\n&gt;&gt; And then you wonder, well, why not?\n\n256\n00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.630\nBecause that's not how this works.\n\n257\n00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.540\nAnd for their intents and purposes,\nthat's basically the answer.\n\n258\n00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.902\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\nAnd I do get it, but.\n\n259\n00:11:47.902 --> 00:11:48.654\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n260\n00:11:48.654 --> 00:11:49.798\n&gt;&gt; It is one of those that.\n\n261\n00:11:49.798 --> 00:11:50.310\n&gt;&gt; Gotta know it.\n\n262\n00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:54.697\n&gt;&gt; It seems logical also, it's like,\nwell they're the same thing.\n\n263\n00:11:54.697 --> 00:11:55.538\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n264\n00:11:55.538 --> 00:11:56.337\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n265\n00:11:56.337 --> 00:11:56.837\n&gt;&gt; It's the same but different.\n\n266\n00:11:56.837 --> 00:11:57.621\n[LAUGH]\n\n267\n00:11:57.621 --> 00:11:58.157\n&gt;&gt; I like-\n\n268\n00:11:58.157 --> 00:11:59.591\n&gt;&gt; I know, my favorite saying.\n\n269\n00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:00.790\nI love it so much.\n\n270\n00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:05.740\nOkay, so now we've got that cleared away,\nback over in Joey.\n\n271\n00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:10.580\nSo I do have the option making one\nsignature, and I can add a bunch of stuff.\n\n272\n00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.620\nNow I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n273\n00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.780\ndelete all this to pretend\nthat I didn't start anything.\n\n274\n00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.320\nAnd I don't have any of\nthese check boxes on, so\n\n275\n00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.540\nI didn't have a signature to begin with.\n\n276\n00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.220\nNow notice you can do quite\na few different things\n\n277\n00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.900\nin the formatting options.\n\n278\n00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:28.576\nI could go ahead and make this say Joey,\nsorry, this is already pre-formatted.\n\n279\n00:12:28.576 --> 00:12:32.124\n[LAUGH] So you can go ahead and pretend\nthat, there we go, I cancelled it out.\n\n280\n00:12:32.124 --> 00:12:36.215\nJoey Baton,\nyou could see that I could select my text.\n\n281\n00:12:36.215 --> 00:12:37.210\nI could make it bold.\n\n282\n00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.450\nI could go ahead and change my fonts.\n\n283\n00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.270\nI could go ahead and\nmake it bigger or smaller.\n\n284\n00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.340\nAll the different thing you\ncould do with formatting.\n\n285\n00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.790\nThere's even some more options here\nof like centering and lots of that.\n\n286\n00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:50.104\nAnd you notice when I\ndid that new message,\n\n287\n00:12:50.104 --> 00:12:52.167\nit was centered aligned in the email.\n\n288\n00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:54.470\nI probably,\nhonestly suggest doing it all left one,\n\n289\n00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.193\ncuz everything's are a left\naligned in your messages anyway.\n\n290\n00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:59.465\nSo putting a signature and center is.\n\n291\n00:12:59.465 --> 00:13:00.008\n&gt;&gt; Weird.\n\n292\n00:13:00.008 --> 00:13:01.660\n&gt;&gt; I personally is it throws me off,\n\n293\n00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.197\nso I did that on purpose\nto say maybe don't do that.\n\n294\n00:13:04.197 --> 00:13:08.270\n&gt;&gt; Yvonne, inside of our Office\n365 the Outlook on the web.\n\n295\n00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.692\nAre you able to put in your\nrainbow jumping over a unicorn, or\n\n296\n00:13:10.692 --> 00:13:11.606\nthe other way around?\n\n297\n00:13:11.606 --> 00:13:14.720\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

It doesn't happen often though, right?\n\n318\n00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.440\nI mean, most people nowadays are\nsupporting an HTML type of environment,\n\n319\n00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.900\njust because why not?\n\n320\n00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:10.800\nIt's around.\nIt's been around.\n\n321\n00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.279\nWe love it.\nIt does great stuff.\n\n322\n00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:13.910\nBut every now and then,\nyou're gonna run into that.\n\n323\n00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.015\nSo you've just gotta be prepared.\n\n324\n00:14:15.015 --> 00:14:17.007\n&gt;&gt; And it's also more of a user setting.\n\n325\n00:14:17.007 --> 00:14:19.607\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n&gt;&gt; They might only, they limit it.\n\n326\n00:14:19.607 --> 00:14:21.340\n&gt;&gt; For security reasons, right?\n\n327\n00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:25.240\nBecause I can put injectable\ncode inside of my signature.\n\n328\n00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.090\nYou're downloading that.\n\n329\n00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:27.071\nIt's coming to your box.\n\n330\n00:14:27.071 --> 00:14:32.633\nAnd then your computer's saying yes,\nrun this HTML code, I want to see that.\n\n331\n00:14:32.633 --> 00:14:33.610\nAnd it's like great,\n\n332\n00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:37.274\nhere's your trojan that let's me backdoor\naccess to your computer, sweet [LAUGH].\n\n333\n00:14:37.274 --> 00:14:40.719\n&gt;&gt;

Okay.\n\n408\n00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:34.790\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n409\n00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:38.300\nthe first one is well, I inserted\nthe picture from my local computer.\n\n410\n00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.390\nIt was a picture of Joey, right?\n\n411\n00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:42.860\nIt was my pictures folder, right?\n\n412\n00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.520\nSo it doesn't live on the web,\nit lives on my computer.\n\n413\n00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.750\nI put it in an email, and there we go.\n\n414\n00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:54.740\nWell, on every direction that you have,\neven on right here.\n\n415\n00:18:54.740 --> 00:19:00.460\nLook at this one, this is from\nMicrosoft Help Files Outlook Web,\n\n416\n00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:04.380\nOffice 365, and it says something\nabout pictures right here.\n\n417\n00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.750\nTo include an image with your signature,\nyou can copy the image from a source and\n\n418\n00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.180\npaste that image into a text box.\n\n419\n00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:14.180\nOkay, keep that in mind for a second, cuz\nthere's this whole thing, I don't know.\n\n420\n00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.440\nDo you remember this, back in the day,\n\n421\n00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.700\nwhen you had to have the image\nHosted somewhere online.\n\n422\n00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.400\n&gt;&gt; So that they can reach out and grab it.\n\n423\n00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.\n\n424\n00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:25.670\n&gt;&gt; Who was dumb.\n\n425\n00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:29.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHTER] And I get the idea, because\nit was like, I'm not going to go into your\n\n426\n00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.850\nlocal picture,\nit's like a picture that you created and\n\n427\n00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:35.900\ninserted into your email-\n&gt;&gt; When bandwidth was lower and\n\n428\n00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:36.720\nstorage was lower,\n\n429\n00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.190\nthat made a whole lot of sense, because we\ndidn't have the storage capacity to keep.\n\n430\n00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.340\nEverybody's signature picture\nloaded on our computer, or\n\n431\n00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.100\nthe bandwidth to go out and grab that\npicture when you're on the internet.\n\n432\n00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.860\nWe're talking dialup days, and\nthings of that nature, remember?\n\n433\n00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.000\nIt wasn't fun.\n\n434\n00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So that's kind of why we did that.\n\n435\n00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.280\nNowadays, we've got high speed bandwidth\nand we've got tons of storage.\n\n436\n00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.970\nThere's no reason to really\nhave to do that anymore.\n\n437\n00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, and this is where I\nfeel like it's almost a contradiction,\n\n438\n00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.170\nbecause this\n&gt;&gt; Help file is for\n\n439\n00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:07.780\nOutlook on the Web Office 365,\nthis is the most up to date one.\n\n440\n00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:08.820\nIt's still saying this.\n\n441\n00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.630\nAnd over here there's on in here where\n\n442\n00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:14.280\nit says how to add an image\nthrough email signature.\n\n443\n00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:18.240\nNow this is from 2015, but\nit just said, right here,\n\n444\n00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.740\nthe whole as we know signatures\nadded do not show up in Web App.\n\n445\n00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.910\nYou have to create two\nsignatures okay that's fine.\n\n446\n00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:27.690\nBut it's just your image will\nhave to be stored on the web,\n\n447\n00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:28.990\nnot your local computer.\n\n448\n00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.060\nAnd I've known this whole thing of\nlike you would have to go ahead and\n\n449\n00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.110\ntake it to somewhere on a website,\n\n450\n00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:41.810\nlike maybe your company email,\nyour signatures on your company.\n\n451\n00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:46.580\nWebsite you go out to that particular\none you go ahead and right click on it\n\n452\n00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:52.440\ncopy the image and then paste it into and\npasting the direct link.\n\n453\n00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.930\nYes, and then of course as\na receiver maybe if you had this two\n\n454\n00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:00.660\nyou had it it says pictures\nhave not been downloaded and\n\n455\n00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.680\nthen you click the download and\nit's just the image.\n\n456\n00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.980\nIt's just the picture in the signature\n\n457\n00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.910\nbecause it's hosted\nexternally on a website.\n\n458\n00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:13.300\nSo this is where it gets\nkinda cloudy honestly.\n\n459\n00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.276\n&gt;&gt; You might made there.\n\n460\n00:21:14.276 --> 00:21:16.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Completely yes.\n\n461\n00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.860\nAnd that's where it's a little or\neven their instruction will tell me.\n\n462\n00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:26.700\nBut wait a second I just wanna had made\na signature and when I made a new message,\n\n463\n00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:32.902\nI was able to go ahead and insert\nthe signature with the picture fine.\n\n464\n00:21:32.902 --> 00:21:34.080\nOkay, I've already done this, right?\n\n465\n00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:34.960\nI've tested this.\n\n466\n00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.330\nSo I'm like okay well maybe it won't work.\n\n467\n00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:43.040\nI sent it to my Gmail account, I sent it\nto my ITProTV account, I sent it to Renee.\n\n468\n00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.390\nHey Renee, can you test this?\n\n469\n00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:47.940\nAnd I'm sending it from Joey's account.\n\n470\n00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.210\nIt's like yeah, it's doing just fine.\n\n471\n00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:53.640\nI can just click the button\nthat says insert news.\n\n472\n00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.090\n&gt;&gt;

Basically your own cloud.\n\n486\n00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:45.750\nYou're making what we call\nan on premises private cloud.\n\n487\n00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:46.527\n&gt;&gt; Yes, right, what you said.\n\n488\n00:22:46.527 --> 00:22:47.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Techie stuff but\n\n489\n00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:51.110\nthat's the whole idea of like your\norganization is set up that way with like\n\n490\n00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:55.430\nI'm gonna say like physical servers like\nmachinery that lives in a room somewhere.\n\n491\n00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.370\nKind of.\n&gt;&gt; That own specifically.\n\n492\n00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:00.880\nThat's the difference.\n\n493\n00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.690\n&gt;&gt; Completely.\n\n494\n00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:05.370\n&gt;&gt; We don't own\nthe Outlook Office 365 servers.\n\n495\n00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:05.920\nMicrosoft does.\n\n496\n00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.090\nThey have control over that.\n\n497\n00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.420\nWe just rent it as a service.\n\n498\n00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.790\nWhereas if I had my own machine sitting\nin a room, like what Von's talking about,\n\n499\n00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:14.280\nI can make it do whatever I want.\n\n500\n00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.340\nI have different capabilities\nbecause of having that\n\n501\n00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:23.420\nupper level of Administrative\nfunctionality because of what I'm.\n\n502\n00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:27.640\n&gt;&gt; And when we go to our old WA as\na user within that organization,\n\n503\n00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.260\nI am getting like,\ndirect access into that server.\n\n504\n00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.550\nPer web thing that's different\nthan the Office 365.\n\n505\n00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.140\nAnd that one I do remember.\n\n506\n00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.130\nYou couldn't-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n507\n00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:37.760\n&gt;&gt; That's the whole,\nyou had to have it hosted, and you have-\n\n508\n00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.740\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n509\n00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:39.560\n&gt;&gt; See?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n510\n00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it makes sense to me-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n511\n00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:45.089\n&gt;&gt; It makes sense to you, and hopefully,\nit's making sense to you as well, even if,\n\n512\n00:23:45.089 --> 00:23:46.390\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Again, just trust us.\n\n513\n00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:49.120\n&gt;&gt; There's magic that's\nhappening behind the scenes.\n\n514\n00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.880\nAnd just understand that you might\nnot get the result you're looking for\n\n515\n00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.550\nwhen it comes to signature pictures.\n\n516\n00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:56.700\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, and\nwe could have just ended it there.\n\n517\n00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.790\nBut I wanna tell you-\n&gt;&gt; yeah, give you a little bit more.\n\n518\n00:23:58.790 --> 00:23:59.890\n&gt;&gt; But why, why?\n\n519\n00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:01.410\n&gt;&gt; Right, like the kid, you know,\n\n520\n00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:04.060\nthe child that doesn't know,\nthey really wanna understand.\n\n521\n00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.200\nThat makes sense, I'm still that way.\n\n522\n00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.060\nI still wanna know why that is.\n\n523\n00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.390\nSo there you go.\nNow you know, right?\n\n524\n00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's why I wanted to explain it to you.\n\n525\n00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:13.860\nSo anyways, it works great, totally good.\n\n526\n00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.870\nSo if you're on Office\n365 you should be fine.\n\n527\n00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.510\nBut just wanted to let you know.\n\n528\n00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.840\nAll right, and the only other thing,\nI'm just looking at my notes to make sure.\n\n529\n00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.740\nOkay, what are possible\nissues with our images.\n\n530\n00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:28.330\nIs that, all of this stuff is the same\non the free version, the outlook.com.\n\n531\n00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:32.170\nYou can go ahead and setup here one\nsingle signature, you can go ahead and\n\n532\n00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:36.530\ninsert an image and that was the one\nin our other episodes where in the web,\n\n533\n00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:42.010\nwhat is this like, .com one I setup\nto mister Bishop Timothy, and so\n\n534\n00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:45.900\nI put in a picture, it's in the same exact\nplace and your options and everything.\n\n535\n00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.990\nSo, you can go ahead And do that.\n\n536\n00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:52.530\nBut if anybody's like, I don't see\na picture of Mr. Bishop, you're like, hm,\n\n537\n00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:57.410\nokay, well then your server doesn't accept\nit, but we know that mileage may vary.\n\n538\n00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.170\n&gt;&gt;

They do.\n\n54\n00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:29.703\n&gt;&gt; They hire people to keep\ntheir lives organized.\n\n55\n00:02:29.703 --> 00:02:35.185\n[LAUGH] Yeah, so these are just gonna be\ndifferent ways that we can go ahead and\n\n56\n00:02:35.185 --> 00:02:37.939\njust lend to us being more organized.\n\n57\n00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.301\nAll right, so why don't we jump on down,\nwe're still in Joey's computer,\n\n58\n00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:43.747\nI'm already signed in,\nwe've got everything set up.\n\n59\n00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:46.277\nSo we're gonna first go over\nsome things that, well,\n\n60\n00:02:46.277 --> 00:02:48.153\nit's actually a little bit of a review.\n\n61\n00:02:48.153 --> 00:02:52.520\nSo we've talked about our mail interface,\nand we've talked about,\n\n62\n00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.480\nin that particular episode, about\nconversations showing as a focused inbox,\n\n63\n00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.490\nsome of those different ways.\n\n64\n00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.757\nAnd it does lend ourselves\nto being more organized, or\n\n65\n00:03:03.757 --> 00:03:06.647\nhow you want to organize your inbox.\n\n66\n00:03:06.647 --> 00:03:09.340\nSo let's go ahead and review those.\n\n67\n00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.113\nNow this is somewhere where\nyou can go into your Settings,\n\n68\n00:03:12.113 --> 00:03:14.048\nwhere we have our little wheel up there.\n\n69\n00:03:14.048 --> 00:03:18.638\nAnd we also have our Filter at\nthe top of our message list, and\n\n70\n00:03:18.638 --> 00:03:22.700\nI do have the reading\npane on to the right.\n\n71\n00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.179\nSo you can say, show as messages or\nconversations, now,\n\n72\n00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:28.098\nthis is a personal preference.\n\n73\n00:03:28.098 --> 00:03:32.970\nI knew somebody that did not like\nconversations at all, I tend to love them.\n\n74\n00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.318\nBecause if I'm having a conversation\nwhere you and I are emailing back and\n\n75\n00:03:36.318 --> 00:03:38.694\nforth over many days about\none particular subject,\n\n76\n00:03:38.694 --> 00:03:41.400\nI don't want them all interspersed\ndown into my messages.\n\n77\n00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.412\nI want everything on that one thread to\nbe together, so I prefer conversations.\n\n78\n00:03:47.412 --> 00:03:48.580\nDo you have a preference, Daniel?\n\n79\n00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.080\n&gt;&gt; I do, I do not like\nthe conversation view at all.\n\n80\n00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.643\nI'm so used to, I just come from that old\nschool where I want to be able to go,\n\n81\n00:03:54.643 --> 00:03:57.652\nokay, that was on, that was\nyesterday when we were talking, so\n\n82\n00:03:57.652 --> 00:04:00.429\nI'll just look in yesterday,\nI'll look at the dates.\n\n83\n00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:01.078\n&gt;&gt; Really?\nOkay.\n\n84\n00:04:01.078 --> 00:04:04.738\n&gt;&gt; And it helps me keep more organized,\nbecause I see my life in like a linear\n\n85\n00:04:04.738 --> 00:04:08.942\nfilm, so that conversation messes me up,\nI'm like, where's all the rest of it?\n\n86\n00:04:08.942 --> 00:04:10.145\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We've gotta include all this,\n\n87\n00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:10.733\nand now all that's gone.\n\n88\n00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:12.161\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm just like this.\n\n89\n00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:13.256\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n90\n00:04:13.256 --> 00:04:14.852\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So it's like,\nwait, what did I just say?\n\n91\n00:04:14.852 --> 00:04:19.300\nI don't remember yesterday, so that's\ninteresting, I love that perspective.\n\n92\n00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.154\n&gt;&gt; To each his own, right?\n\n93\n00:04:20.154 --> 00:04:21.542\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so, [LAUGH].\n\n94\n00:04:21.542 --> 00:04:22.626\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna throw mine\n\n95\n00:04:22.626 --> 00:04:23.243\ninto conversations, so.\n\n96\n00:04:23.243 --> 00:04:23.805\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n97\n00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:24.913\nyou do that, you show us how it's done.\n\n98\n00:04:24.913 --> 00:04:25.769\n&gt;&gt; I will.\n\n99\n00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:29.564\nSo you can see that I've got\nthis all in conversations now.\n\n100\n00:04:29.564 --> 00:04:34.371\nAnd what I see are these little triangles\nnext to it that will let me know\n\n101\n00:04:34.371 --> 00:04:36.991\nif there is any type of back and forth.\n\n102\n00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:41.051\nAnd I mean, I know that I used this\nwhen I worked at the university, because\n\n103\n00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:45.250\nwe could have a conversation on the same\ntopic over months and months of time.\n\n104\n00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.706\nAnd so it's all right there, so\nI can keep it organized into,\n\n105\n00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:55.120\nI think more of, I remember talking\nto Daniel and what we were saying.\n\n106\n00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.778\nI don't remember when, I just remember\nwhat we were talking about in that\n\n107\n00:04:58.778 --> 00:05:02.650\nsentence there, so keeping it in\nconversations is one way to do it.\n\n108\n00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.146\nAnother way that you can do, that's\njust how we're going to kind of have our\n\n109\n00:05:07.146 --> 00:05:10.743\nmessage list, is whether not\nyou wanna show focused inbox.\n\n110\n00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:14.323\nThis is something newer,\nand when I say newer,\n\n111\n00:05:14.323 --> 00:05:17.733\nat the time of this recording,\nit was newer.\n\n112\n00:05:17.733 --> 00:05:20.912\nThis is where when focused comes in,\n\n113\n00:05:20.912 --> 00:05:25.628\nit's kind of like your junk mail and\nalso kind of like,\n\n114\n00:05:25.628 --> 00:05:30.880\nwhat was used to be known as clutter,\nclutter still exists.\n\n115\n00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.510\nAnd we will talk about these concepts more\nin depth when we get into the junk mail\n\n116\n00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.764\nepisode, so, check that one out if\nyou want a little bit more in here.\n\n117\n00:05:37.764 --> 00:05:40.206\nBut basically what it is, it's like,\n\n118\n00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:44.951\nwhat are things that are focused to me\nversus maybe some promotional ideas?\n\n119\n00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:48.708\nThis is something that in my\npersonal mail, or my work mail for\n\n120\n00:05:48.708 --> 00:05:53.359\nmy ITProTV account, this is where all\nof our Twitter feeds and everything.\n\n121\n00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:53.992\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n122\n00:05:53.992 --> 00:05:57.574\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you know we're all on social\nmedia and everything like that, and\n\n123\n00:05:57.574 --> 00:06:00.597\nit's like, so and so\nis following you, this and that, or\n\n124\n00:06:00.597 --> 00:06:05.970\nthat goes into my other, it's important,\nbut it's really, well, not as important.\n\n125\n00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.844\nNow, this is one of those things\nthat it kind of judges whether\n\n126\n00:06:10.844 --> 00:06:15.171\nit's in the other or\nwhether it's focused on its own.\n\n127\n00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:20.365\nAnd you have to kind of train it to know,\nhey, I really want this\n\n128\n00:06:20.365 --> 00:06:25.472\nto be in my focused section of\nmy mailbox rather than my other.\n\n129\n00:06:25.472 --> 00:06:29.729\nBecause it is something that I do want to\nput my focus on and have it come in, and\n\n130\n00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.280\nso that's one of those things\nthat's kinda like our junk mail.\n\n131\n00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.280\nAgain, I'm kinda lumping this all\ntogether, it's in our organization, too.\n\n132\n00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.218\nAlways check your junk mail, because you\ncan set policies and everything like that,\n\n133\n00:06:41.218 --> 00:06:42.920\nbut sometimes it just goes in there.\n\n134\n00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.760\nAnd you don't know why or\nhow it gets there sometimes,\n\n135\n00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.439\nI know we've had this problem.\n\n136\n00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:49.023\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; With our regular mail, too, right?\n\n137\n00:06:49.023 --> 00:06:49.876\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n138\n00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:54.861\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I've been talking to James,\nand we were talking in our inbox,\n\n139\n00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:58.320\nbut then somehow all three\nof his responses to me.\n\n140\n00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.889\n&gt;&gt; It's fun.\n\n141\n00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:01.332\n&gt;&gt; Right, he got, I'm like,\nwhy did you send that to junk mail?\n\n142\n00:07:01.332 --> 00:07:03.406\nI've been talking to him for\ntwo weeks, so.\n\n143\n00:07:03.406 --> 00:07:05.644\n&gt;&gt; It's just trying, it's just Microsoft\ntrying to wreck relationships.\n\n144\n00:07:05.644 --> 00:07:08.612\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and so you have,\n\n145\n00:07:08.612 --> 00:07:13.219\nit actually talks about in blogs and\nthings that I read, that you train it.\n\n146\n00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:17.202\nYou literally have to say no,\nstop going into junk, or no,\n\n147\n00:07:17.202 --> 00:07:20.639\nstop going into the other,\nand put it on the focus.\n\n148\n00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:25.656\nSo notice it just becomes these two\nkind of filters up at the top when you\n\n149\n00:07:25.656 --> 00:07:30.772\nhave a focused versus other, or\nfocused versus a non-focused inbox.\n\n150\n00:07:30.772 --> 00:07:33.130\nAnd you can even see some of this stuff,\n\n151\n00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.993\nlike the No Reply to SharePoint Online\nwhen something has been shared with Joey,\n\n152\n00:07:37.993 --> 00:07:42.380\nor in the Office 365 Team,\nlike some of these things from Microsoft.\n\n153\n00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.432\nOkay, I need to know what\nthey're telling me, but\n\n154\n00:07:44.432 --> 00:07:45.878\nI don't really need it in my focus.\n\n155\n00:07:45.878 --> 00:07:50.988\nBut this is something where if I\ndid really need this, I can right\n\n156\n00:07:50.988 --> 00:07:56.965\nclick on this message and you can see\nthat I can move it to the focused inbox.\n\n157\n00:07:56.965 --> 00:08:01.425\nAnd so then it's like,\njust move over onto that side, and\n\n158\n00:08:01.425 --> 00:08:06.906\nhopefully it will remember that and\nnot put a email from, what do I got?\n\n159\n00:08:06.906 --> 00:08:11.177\nMicrosoft Office 365 Team on my other,\nit'll put it back on my focused, so\n\n160\n00:08:11.177 --> 00:08:14.040\nthose are other ways that\nyou can go ahead and start.\n\n161\n00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.650\nOr same way as if your in a focused inbox,\nyou could go ahead and\n\n162\n00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:22.164\ntake an email from the focused side, and\nput it over to the other, like okay,\n\n163\n00:08:22.164 --> 00:08:24.329\nthat's just not just as important.\n\n164\n00:08:24.329 --> 00:08:29.621\nSo it just kinda threw it over to each\nside of my inbox, if I wanna go ahead and\n\n165\n00:08:29.621 --> 00:08:34.010\nshow it as focused,\nthat's pretty awesome, so there we go.\n\n166\n00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.331\nYou can see some other things, some\nother ways that we can use our filters,\n\n167\n00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:42.995\nwhich we'll come back around to when we\ntalk about flags and unread, and so on and\n\n168\n00:08:42.995 --> 00:08:43.629\nso forth.\n\n169\n00:08:43.629 --> 00:08:47.690\nOkay, so we're on this whole\ntopic of staying organized,\n\n170\n00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:53.075\ncuz sometimes you might come into your\nemail, I've got 65 emails in there.\n\n171\n00:08:53.075 --> 00:08:57.168\nHm, okay, well, I gotta take some time\nto prioritize what I need to do and\n\n172\n00:08:57.168 --> 00:08:58.631\nwho I need to answer when.\n\n173\n00:08:58.631 --> 00:09:02.633\nAnd all right, well, maybe one email,\nI just need to kinda let it sit back for\n\n174\n00:09:02.633 --> 00:09:04.743\na while, let me read it really quickly.\n\n175\n00:09:04.743 --> 00:09:08.337\nBut then let me go ahead and\nmark it back as unread, so\n\n176\n00:09:08.337 --> 00:09:13.550\nthat's an indication to me that that's\nsomething I need to follow up on.\n\n177\n00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.660\nSo let's talk about the mark as unread,\nand the settings that you can go ahead and\n\n178\n00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.784\nset from within, well, your settings.\n\n179\n00:09:19.784 --> 00:09:26.960\n[LAUGH] So let's come back in here, we\nhave this, this is our Lance test, okay?\n\n180\n00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.314\n[LAUGH] Cuz Lance is having\nsome problems this week.\n\n181\n00:09:29.314 --> 00:09:29.962\n&gt;&gt;

He's a deadbeat, that's what it is,\nhe's got no money, that's the problem.\n\n185\n00:09:38.145 --> 00:09:38.791\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n186\n00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:39.718\n&gt;&gt; Somebody didn't pay the bill.\n\n187\n00:09:39.718 --> 00:09:42.531\n&gt;&gt; Well, what happens, or something\nlike that, is your credit card expires,\n\n188\n00:09:42.531 --> 00:09:45.086\nyou forget about it, you forget where\nyou've got auto pay set up, and\n\n189\n00:09:45.086 --> 00:09:45.934\nthese things happen.\n\n190\n00:09:45.934 --> 00:09:48.497\n&gt;&gt;

So sweet of him.\n\n194\n00:09:53.206 --> 00:09:56.918\n&gt;&gt; So it's making sure that actually Lance\ncould go ahead and email back and forth,\n\n195\n00:09:56.918 --> 00:09:58.325\nso that was my test.\n\n196\n00:09:58.325 --> 00:10:00.978\nWell, this is something that maybe,\nas I'm going down my list, it's like,\n\n197\n00:10:00.978 --> 00:10:02.642\nI've read it, but\nnow I wanna mark it as unread.\n\n198\n00:10:02.642 --> 00:10:07.340\nSo one way you can do this is to go ahead\nand right-click and mark as unread.\n\n199\n00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.146\nAnd notice that when I click\noff of this to the next one,\n\n200\n00:10:10.146 --> 00:10:13.688\nnow it's just showing me that,\nhey, you didn't catch it just yet.\n\n201\n00:10:13.688 --> 00:10:17.842\nCuz that's maybe some way of your\norganization, of if it's not blue, or\n\n202\n00:10:17.842 --> 00:10:22.331\nwhatever color your theme is, by the way,\nand it's saying that it's unread,\n\n203\n00:10:22.331 --> 00:10:24.208\nI know I need to follow up on that.\n\n204\n00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:27.241\nSo that's one way that you can do it,\nbut notice if I'm going through and\n\n205\n00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:31.635\nI come back over to tests, and I click off\nof it, well, look at what just happened.\n\n206\n00:10:31.635 --> 00:10:36.451\nJust by me clicking off of this in\nmy message list, it goes ahead and\n\n207\n00:10:36.451 --> 00:10:42.041\nputs it back to, well, it's marked as red,\nso I'd have to keep going back,\n\n208\n00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:46.172\nso this is a setting that you\ncan do within your settings.\n\n209\n00:10:46.172 --> 00:10:47.377\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\n\n210\n00:10:47.377 --> 00:10:48.433\nlet's keep on spinning.\n\n211\n00:10:48.433 --> 00:10:53.113\nSo we're gonna go into our mail settings,\ninto here, and\n\n212\n00:10:53.113 --> 00:10:57.880\nthen over on the left hand\nside you can see mark as read.\n\n213\n00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.626\nAnd this is where you can see there's\nsome different options in here,\n\n214\n00:11:01.626 --> 00:11:05.260\nmark as read when selection changes,\nthat's what's happening.\n\n215\n00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:09.106\nI'm selecting it within my message\nlist with the reading pane on, and so\n\n216\n00:11:09.106 --> 00:11:12.810\nnow it's gonna go ahead and\nsay, yep, I've already read it.\n\n217\n00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:17.429\nSo if you didn't like that, you could go\nahead and tell it to, don't automatically\n\n218\n00:11:17.429 --> 00:11:21.673\nmark items as read, that way I have to\nmanually right-click and say, read.\n\n219\n00:11:21.673 --> 00:11:23.890\nSo those are some different things,\n\n220\n00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:27.480\nmark items as read as soon\nas they are selected.\n\n221\n00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.954\nThat's just like, not, as soon as you\nselect it, then it just stops right there.\n\n222\n00:11:30.954 --> 00:11:33.608\nThis is after you've clicked it and\nmoved on to it,\n\n223\n00:11:33.608 --> 00:11:35.786\nthat's what it's like when it changes.\n\n224\n00:11:35.786 --> 00:11:42.560\nAnd then mark if you have, after a delay,\nI probably wouldn't do this.\n\n225\n00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.945\nIf anything, I would do the stop\nautomatically marking it and\n\n226\n00:11:45.945 --> 00:11:47.450\nthen me manually go ahead.\n\n227\n00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.966\nAnd if I'm using this kind of read and\n\n228\n00:11:49.966 --> 00:11:55.090\nunread as a way of organizing myself\nas to know what I'm doing around here.\n\n229\n00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.190\nSo I wanted to go ahead and\npoint that out to you.\n\n230\n00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:01.447\nI'm gonna keep it with the,\nas selection changes, because, well,\n\n231\n00:12:01.447 --> 00:12:04.850\njust because, [LAUGH],\nit's what I'm used to, okay?\n\n232\n00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:09.090\nI don't use this as the read and\nunread to organize myself, for\n\n233\n00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:12.611\nme personally, so\nwe wanted to go ahead and do that.\n\n234\n00:12:12.611 --> 00:12:18.289\nI did want to show you that\nwhen the reading pane is off,\n\n235\n00:12:18.289 --> 00:12:25.456\nthis is one of those, this gets into\nmy personal opinions of things.\n\n236\n00:12:25.456 --> 00:12:30.322\nLike when I go into the reading pane,\nwhich is down here in the Layout,\n\n237\n00:12:30.322 --> 00:12:34.860\nand I go to Reading pane,\nyou can hide the reading pane.\n\n238\n00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.654\nNow if I take that off and I save this,\nlet's push off the settings,\n\n239\n00:12:38.654 --> 00:12:41.663\nwe'll take out the options,\nand now I have this way.\n\n240\n00:12:41.663 --> 00:12:45.720\nI actually I like this view,\nif I'm on a desktop view.\n\n241\n00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.991\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because, it's, I have to,\n\n242\n00:12:47.991 --> 00:12:52.763\nif I wanna open a mail, I'd have to\ngo ahead and double click on it.\n\n243\n00:12:52.763 --> 00:12:55.870\nWell, the thing is, with this,\nwhen you have the reading pane off,\n\n244\n00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.297\nI didn't double click it,\nI just single clicked it.\n\n245\n00:12:58.297 --> 00:13:03.956\nSo this is another one of those things\nthat just kind of bothers me personally,\n\n246\n00:13:03.956 --> 00:13:08.844\nwhere if I close this, and I,\ncuz I wanna use this as a selection.\n\n247\n00:13:08.844 --> 00:13:10.757\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; To select it within my message list\n\n248\n00:13:10.757 --> 00:13:14.065\nto say, hey, all right, let me-\n&gt;&gt; You just wanna highlight that email,\n\n249\n00:13:14.065 --> 00:13:15.028\nnot necessarily open it.\n\n250\n00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:18.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you click it,\nit will always open it.\n\n251\n00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.556\n&gt;&gt; I wonder if that's due to\nthe fact that it's inside a browser,\n\n252\n00:13:22.556 --> 00:13:26.519\nit's a Web thing, where inside of Web,\nyou single click stuff.\n\n253\n00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:29.843\n&gt;&gt; That's a really good way to think about\nit, yeah, cuz it's like you click it.\n\n254\n00:13:29.843 --> 00:13:30.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You go somewhere.\n\n255\n00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.944\n&gt;&gt; It's one man's musings, could be wrong.\n\n256\n00:13:32.944 --> 00:13:33.446\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n257\n00:13:33.446 --> 00:13:34.993\n&gt;&gt; Who knows?\nWhat the heck?\n\n258\n00:13:34.993 --> 00:13:36.437\n&gt;&gt; I'll roll with that.\n\n259\n00:13:36.437 --> 00:13:37.914\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, these are one of those things, and\n\n260\n00:13:37.914 --> 00:13:40.280\nI don't know if you all out there too,\nwhere I'm just like!\n\n261\n00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.784\nIt bothers me, it's like,\nI really want to stay in this,\n\n262\n00:13:43.784 --> 00:13:47.303\nnot have the reading pane on,\ncuz I really like this view.\n\n263\n00:13:47.303 --> 00:13:50.642\nBut I can't stand that you won't\nlet me just single click it and\n\n264\n00:13:50.642 --> 00:13:52.220\nnot open the actual message.\n\n265\n00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.940\n&gt;&gt; What if you just do the control click,\n\n266\n00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:59.040\nlike if you were gonna select\nmore than one message?\n\n267\n00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:04.797\n&gt;&gt; Well, I can, okay, so, that's one\nthing, if I'm selecting multiples,\n\n268\n00:14:04.797 --> 00:14:10.660\nand this is, again, one of those, I just\nwant to click it and not have it open.\n\n269\n00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:16.783\nWell, the thing is, if I just kind of use\nthe check box, if I want to select that,\n\n270\n00:14:16.783 --> 00:14:21.670\nI can do it, but I have to always think,\ngo over to the check box.\n\n271\n00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:22.669\n&gt;&gt; Click right there in the box.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n272\n00:14:22.669 --> 00:14:27.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or hold control down and\nclick on it.\n\n273\n00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.222\n&gt;&gt; Again, one of those, it's so\nslight, it's like, just let it go,\n\n274\n00:14:29.222 --> 00:14:30.110\njust click the box and you'll be fine.\n\n275\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.653\nI don't know, it's just a thing with me,\nI'm like, I don't want you to open it, and\n\n276\n00:14:33.653 --> 00:14:35.765\nautomatically my mouse just goes-\n&gt;&gt; Whoa there, Vonne.\n\n277\n00:14:35.765 --> 00:14:37.314\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Pull it back, girl.\n\n278\n00:14:37.314 --> 00:14:38.678\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; He's like, all right,\n\n279\n00:14:38.678 --> 00:14:40.670\ndon't get all in a tissy.\n\n280\n00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.631\n&gt;&gt; Put the guns away.\n\n281\n00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:43.292\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly,\n\n282\n00:14:43.292 --> 00:14:47.126\nso it's just one of those things\nthat I wanted to point out to you,\n\n283\n00:14:47.126 --> 00:14:49.660\ncuz maybe it is just me and\nmy little thing.\n\n284\n00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:54.359\nBut, I just have to remember that\nif I am in the non-reading pane, or\n\n285\n00:14:54.359 --> 00:14:58.895\nif the reading pane is off, I have\nto use the check boxes to be able to\n\n286\n00:14:58.895 --> 00:15:02.639\nselect things,\nto be able to do things with it, okay?\n\n287\n00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:05.605\nIf I did wanna open it,\nthen I go ahead and\n\n288\n00:15:05.605 --> 00:15:10.331\nclick on to the subject line, and\nthen I can go ahead and open it.\n\n289\n00:15:10.331 --> 00:15:13.259\nSo it's kind of a me thing,\nall right, yes, but\n\n290\n00:15:13.259 --> 00:15:16.416\nI've kinda just trained myself to,\nyou know what?\n\n291\n00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:19.087\nJust go ahead and put the reading\npane back on and you'll be fine,\n\n292\n00:15:19.087 --> 00:15:20.203\ncuz that's just-\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n293\n00:15:20.203 --> 00:15:23.132\nif you do the reading pane instead\nof to the right and the above,\n\n294\n00:15:23.132 --> 00:15:27.220\nyou can kind of get that view and\nyou can shrink the reading pane view.\n\n295\n00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.375\nAnd basically give you what you're looking\nfor with barely a reading in there.\n\n296\n00:15:30.375 --> 00:15:32.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're right, I like that.\n\n297\n00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.750\nJust with my resolution I\ndon't have enough space.\n\n298\n00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.154\nSo it's just more of like a, I'm gonna,\n\n299\n00:15:38.154 --> 00:15:42.294\nlet's just show really quickly where\nit's on the bottom right there.\n\n300\n00:15:42.294 --> 00:15:46.430\nIt's just, okay, I gotcha, and I know I\ncan come with that little line, like he's\n\n301\n00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:50.423\ntalking about, so I'm glad you pointed\nthis out so we can go ahead and show this.\n\n302\n00:15:50.423 --> 00:15:53.467\nBut then it's like, I can't even\nreally see anything that much.\n\n303\n00:15:53.467 --> 00:15:55.088\n&gt;&gt; But you don't want to use it anyway,\nright?\n\n304\n00:15:55.088 --> 00:15:56.966\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so, you know what?\n\n305\n00:15:56.966 --> 00:15:58.683\nNow that you're saying it,\nI’m like actually this isn't too bad.\n\n306\n00:15:58.683 --> 00:16:02.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I just hadn't had that resolution to\n\n307\n00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.929\nhave this space.\n\n308\n00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:04.468\n&gt;&gt; I’m problem solver Vonne,\nthat's what I do.\n\n309\n00:16:04.468 --> 00:16:05.402\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n310\n00:16:05.402 --> 00:16:08.566\nthis is the whole idea of this\nepisode is to keep you organized and\n\n311\n00:16:08.566 --> 00:16:10.100\nto keep you running smoothly.\n\n312\n00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.248\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nIt's all about making it so easy for\n\n313\n00:16:12.248 --> 00:16:15.700\nyou to navigate throughout\nOutlook that it's second nature.\n\n314\n00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.000\nEverything is just exactly\nwhere you think it should be,\n\n315\n00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.760\nbecause that's how you think, that's how\nyou work, it's how your mind operates.\n\n316\n00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.723\nAnd being able to adjust it to that\nwill help you be much more organized and\n\n317\n00:16:24.723 --> 00:16:25.730\nmore efficient.\n\n318\n00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.740\n&gt;&gt;

That's right.\n&gt;&gt; I’m just gonna start over.\n\n368\n00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.620\nThat's probably not the way you wanna go.\n\n369\n00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.380\n&gt;&gt; Probably not.\n\n370\n00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.120\n&gt;&gt; Probably not.\n\n371\n00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.000\nSo, that box up at the top\nis like an all button\n\n372\n00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.770\nin a sense of screenshot\nversus then select everything.\n\n373\n00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:13.600\nOkay, so\ndifferent ways that we can select things.\n\n374\n00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:19.004\nLet's move on to, ooh the way that I like\nto organize myself is to flag things.\n\n375\n00:19:19.004 --> 00:19:21.306\nNow I've actually flagged\na couple right now.\n\n376\n00:19:21.306 --> 00:19:28.235\nYou can see right here on Renee's email,\nI've got this little red flag on there.\n\n377\n00:19:28.235 --> 00:19:32.232\nThis is just that kind of internal,\nhey gotta follow up on this,\n\n378\n00:19:32.232 --> 00:19:34.390\nmake sure that I come back to that.\n\n379\n00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:36.770\nAnd I use this exclusively.\n\n380\n00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.717\nThis is my way of organizing myself.\n\n381\n00:19:38.717 --> 00:19:42.239\n&gt;&gt; My only thing that I don't like about\nthe flags is I don't think they're\n\n382\n00:19:42.239 --> 00:19:42.883\nbig enough.\n\n383\n00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.540\n&gt;&gt; I really like visual cues and\nthat's a great one.\n\n384\n00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:51.056\nIt's just a little small, so\nif you're scrolling a little too fast,\n\n385\n00:19:51.056 --> 00:19:52.618\nyou'll miss them sometimes.\n\n386\n00:19:52.618 --> 00:19:54.104\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I wish it was just a little bit\n\n387\n00:19:54.104 --> 00:19:55.409\nbigger to stand out a little more.\n\n388\n00:19:55.409 --> 00:19:56.866\nOther than that, this is a great program.\n\n389\n00:19:56.866 --> 00:19:58.750\n&gt;&gt; That's a good point.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n390\n00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:59.540\n&gt;&gt; So, right, perfect.\n\n391\n00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.124\nYeah, it is a little small and\nthere's also something like,\n\n392\n00:20:02.124 --> 00:20:03.675\nwhat are those little colored bars.\n\n393\n00:20:03.675 --> 00:20:04.530\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I've checked it off and it's good.\n\n403\n00:20:33.771 --> 00:20:37.150\nAnd yes, I've followed up with Renee,\nlet me check that off.\n\n404\n00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of people do use their\ninbox as like a checklist of things.\n\n405\n00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:40.778\nI've gotta do that.\n\n406\n00:20:40.778 --> 00:20:43.680\nOnce I'm done,\nI check it off and I'm done.\n\n407\n00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.390\nMy checklist is decreasing.\n\n408\n00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:49.249\n&gt;&gt; And now I get the icon, there's like\nsomething satisfying about the [NOISE].\n\n409\n00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:50.752\nYeah, I did it.\n\n410\n00:20:50.752 --> 00:20:51.252\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n411\n00:20:51.252 --> 00:20:53.486\n&gt;&gt;

I do, I love color coding,\n\n415\n00:20:56.816 --> 00:21:00.116\nI like checking things off.\nI mean, I have it in my list of my\n\n416\n00:21:00.116 --> 00:21:04.027\nepisodes, like [NOISE], done, yay!\nAnd yes, cuz I print things out and\n\n417\n00:21:04.027 --> 00:21:06.616\nthen write it and check it off.\nYes I do that.\n\n418\n00:21:06.616 --> 00:21:07.324\nAll right, so\n\n419\n00:21:07.324 --> 00:21:10.342\nsome other ways that we can go ahead and\norganize ourselves.\n\n420\n00:21:10.342 --> 00:21:12.730\nThere's also pinning.\n\n421\n00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:17.580\nYou could pin an email to\nthe top of your message list.\n\n422\n00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.054\nFor example, maybe this one from Joey.\n\n423\n00:21:20.054 --> 00:21:22.225\nWell, this is from Joey to Joey.\n\n424\n00:21:22.225 --> 00:21:23.920\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why don't we go with Justin?\n\n425\n00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.300\nHere we go about Excel.\n\n426\n00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:29.100\nSo I can take this little icon,\nthis is what they call the quick view,\n\n427\n00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.450\nI believe it's called.\n\n428\n00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.350\nSo this area right in here\nwhere I hover over it.\n\n429\n00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:35.590\nI can say, yep,\nlet's go ahead and pin that.\n\n430\n00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:37.220\nAnd now I have a conversation pinned.\n\n431\n00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:41.503\nIf you've used Facebook Groups,\nif you have anything like that,\n\n432\n00:21:41.503 --> 00:21:44.414\nyou know there's always\nlike a pinned post.\n\n433\n00:21:44.414 --> 00:21:45.114\nYou know what I’m talking about?\n\n434\n00:21:45.114 --> 00:21:48.202\n&gt;&gt; Well, usually like the rules of the\ngroup of whatever, something that's always\n\n435\n00:21:48.202 --> 00:21:51.081\non top so as soon as you go to that page,\nthat's the first thing you'll see.\n\n436\n00:21:51.081 --> 00:21:52.000\n&gt;&gt; It's exactly like that.\n\n437\n00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.558\n&gt;&gt; Forums do the same thing.\n\n438\n00:21:53.558 --> 00:21:56.360\nYeah, so you can have pinned messages.\n\n439\n00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.460\nIf I wanted to take this,\nlike the read and\n\n440\n00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.570\ndelivery receipt, pin it up to the top.\n\n441\n00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.398\nAnd you can see that it\nwill always go ahead and\n\n442\n00:22:03.398 --> 00:22:06.458\ngive me my little icon\nover there onto the right.\n\n443\n00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:08.712\nNow the pin instead of\ngoing this way is up, down.\n\n444\n00:22:08.712 --> 00:22:12.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Straight up and down versus horizontal.\n\n445\n00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:14.250\nSo now I know that I've pinned this.\n\n446\n00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:17.930\nAnd once I have something pinned,\nif I wanted to not have it pinned,\n\n447\n00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:21.550\nI could go ahead and\nkeep this message at the top.\n\n448\n00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:25.562\nOkay, well now I'm going to take it off,\nand notice that it will go back into-\n\n449\n00:22:25.562 --> 00:22:26.280\n&gt;&gt; Its order.\n\n450\n00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.030\n&gt;&gt; Its order of how you have it sorted.\n\n451\n00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.270\nMight as well throw that in there\nreally quickly is in the filter,\n\n452\n00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.360\nyou can also sort by.\n\n453\n00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.842\nNow, the default one is dates\nin descending order, so\n\n454\n00:22:36.842 --> 00:22:38.439\nthe newest is at the top.\n\n455\n00:22:38.439 --> 00:22:39.621\n&gt;&gt; You mean the right way.\n\n456\n00:22:39.621 --> 00:22:42.144\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n457\n00:22:42.144 --> 00:22:45.339\nBut you can see you could\nalways sort it by attachments.\n\n458\n00:22:45.339 --> 00:22:49.434\nThis is one of those like I know somebody\nsent it, I know it was an attachment,\n\n459\n00:22:49.434 --> 00:22:51.556\nand I know it was something with Excel.\n\n460\n00:22:51.556 --> 00:22:55.131\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I'll just go ahead and\nsort it by attachments and then,\n\n461\n00:22:55.131 --> 00:22:56.041\noop there it is.\n\n462\n00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:58.480\nAnd again other ways,\nthat's more of a searching.\n\n463\n00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.473\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of searching.\n\n464\n00:22:59.473 --> 00:23:02.833\nIt's organized, it's all, what is it?\n\n465\n00:23:02.833 --> 00:23:05.860\nOrganize, customize, and search, my!\n\n466\n00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.790\n[LAUGH] So we're good with that one.\n\n467\n00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:11.340\nAll right, let's keep on moving.\n\n468\n00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.805\nI think there's one other\nthing that we can go ahead and\n\n469\n00:23:13.805 --> 00:23:15.852\ncover it right now before\nwe gotta wrap it up.\n\n470\n00:23:15.852 --> 00:23:19.260\nI know that you're giving me the little\nsignal, like we're coming towards the end.\n\n471\n00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.325\nYep, exactly.\n\n472\n00:23:20.325 --> 00:23:23.650\nWe're going to talk about categories.\n\n473\n00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:27.058\n[LAUGH] So with categories,\nthese are the color codes.\n\n474\n00:23:27.058 --> 00:23:29.150\nThis is where I get to\ncolor code everything.\n\n475\n00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.095\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne loses her mind and\nwe all reap the benefits.\n\n476\n00:23:32.095 --> 00:23:35.212\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah so I can see that,\n\n477\n00:23:35.212 --> 00:23:40.041\nnow I don't have any scheme going\non right now for Joey's inbox, but\n\n478\n00:23:40.041 --> 00:23:44.869\nnotice that with Justin,\nI had a little guy over here, right there,\n\n479\n00:23:44.869 --> 00:23:48.224\nI think that's, we'll call that red, okay?\n\n480\n00:23:48.224 --> 00:23:51.445\nAnd then the one from Renee,\nthat's green and if I scroll down,\n\n481\n00:23:51.445 --> 00:23:54.980\nthere's one that's Orange,\nnow this is where, what do those mean?\n\n482\n00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:59.213\nWell, it means something to you,\nit means something to someone, yeah.\n\n483\n00:23:59.213 --> 00:24:01.293\nI would have to determine,\n\n484\n00:24:01.293 --> 00:24:07.177\neverything that's red is dealing with\nthe VMA Awards that we're planning.\n\n485\n00:24:07.177 --> 00:24:12.745\nOr the green means something about\nredoing the tour bus painting,\n\n486\n00:24:12.745 --> 00:24:15.240\nall of those types of things.\n\n487\n00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:20.077\nYou have to determine what\nyour colors mean to you.\n\n488\n00:24:20.077 --> 00:24:25.090\nNow how can we, one,\napply a category to an email?\n\n489\n00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.888\nAnd categories, by the way, is not just\nfor emails, it could be for contacts,\n\n490\n00:24:28.888 --> 00:24:31.458\nit could be for tasks,\nit could be for appointments.\n\n491\n00:24:31.458 --> 00:24:34.821\nAnything that's within Outlook all\ntogether, you could go ahead and\n\n492\n00:24:34.821 --> 00:24:35.508\ncategorize.\n\n493\n00:24:35.508 --> 00:24:37.846\nAnd think about it,\nif you start color coding and\n\n494\n00:24:37.846 --> 00:24:41.614\ncategorizing all of these different\nthings, you're thinking, well,\n\n495\n00:24:41.614 --> 00:24:44.237\nthen if I just go ahead and\njust show me all the yellows,\n\n496\n00:24:44.237 --> 00:24:48.028\ntell me everything that is categorized\nas yellow, then it'll pull it all up.\n\n497\n00:24:48.028 --> 00:24:51.909\nNow don't get too ahead of yourself,\nbecause there's a little snafu in\n\n498\n00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:54.849\nthat one,\nwhen you talk about searching by category.\n\n499\n00:24:54.849 --> 00:24:56.353\nIt's not as straightforward in Outlook for\nWeb.\n\n500\n00:24:57.612 --> 00:24:59.742\n&gt;&gt; It is on the desktop version,\nway better.\n\n501\n00:24:59.742 --> 00:25:03.036\nBut that's just something about how to\nkind of pull it all out from within\n\n502\n00:25:03.036 --> 00:25:03.960\nthe web interface.\n\n503\n00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:08.052\nAll right, now, back to here,\nif I wanted to color-code this\n\n504\n00:25:08.052 --> 00:25:12.856\nJustin Timberlake Excel message,\nyou can do a couple different things.\n\n505\n00:25:12.856 --> 00:25:15.611\nYou can right-click on it, categorize, and\n\n506\n00:25:15.611 --> 00:25:18.512\nyou can see that I have\ndifferent colors in here.\n\n507\n00:25:18.512 --> 00:25:23.280\nYou could also come up to the top and\nuse the category in that menu,\n\n508\n00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.679\nthat top menu bar.\n\n509\n00:25:24.679 --> 00:25:28.957\nAnd notice that it has blue, green,\norange, then there's one called band.\n\n510\n00:25:28.957 --> 00:25:30.343\nWell that's because I named it.\n\n511\n00:25:30.343 --> 00:25:32.711\n&gt;&gt; Because, how do you think\nyou can manage your categories?\n\n512\n00:25:32.711 --> 00:25:35.835\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, you click on that, and\n\n513\n00:25:35.835 --> 00:25:41.325\nthen you can see, if I go to here,\nif I wanted to take this blue category,\n\n514\n00:25:41.325 --> 00:25:44.663\nI could even change it\nto teal if I wanted to.\n\n515\n00:25:44.663 --> 00:25:49.469\nAnd then I could also go ahead and close\nit out, you could add a new category.\n\n516\n00:25:49.469 --> 00:25:52.628\nAnd some different ways that you\ncan do that, so you can say,\n\n517\n00:25:52.628 --> 00:25:56.600\nmaybe I don’t want that category, I don't\nwant this here, you can close it out.\n\n518\n00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.060\nBut now it says, there are items\nthat are already assigned to this,\n\n519\n00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.238\ndo you want to have it affected?\n\n520\n00:26:00.238 --> 00:26:04.106\nSo you've got to be careful about this,\nthis is one of those things you probably\n\n521\n00:26:04.106 --> 00:26:07.009\ngo ahead and set pretty,\nI would say in the beginning, or?\n\n522\n00:26:07.009 --> 00:26:08.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, early in the game.\n\n523\n00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.121\n&gt;&gt; Early in the game, yeah.\n\n524\n00:26:09.121 --> 00:26:14.075\nOr now the other thing is, well,\nI don't know about red, but\n\n525\n00:26:14.075 --> 00:26:20.867\nI really want to make a pink category and\nhave it to be, talk unicorns, or whatever.\n\n526\n00:26:20.867 --> 00:26:21.881\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say\nbreast cancer awareness.\n\n527\n00:26:21.881 --> 00:26:23.822\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We can do that.\n\n528\n00:26:23.822 --> 00:26:24.718\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense right?\n\n529\n00:26:24.718 --> 00:26:27.828\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, especially if\nthe band's coming together for\n\n530\n00:26:27.828 --> 00:26:31.915\nan event at a football game for\nbreast cancer awareness, there we go.\n\n531\n00:26:31.915 --> 00:26:37.119\nSo you can see that I can add a new\ncategory in there and we can name it pink.\n\n532\n00:26:37.119 --> 00:26:42.019\nAnd then we can go ahead and say Half\ntime event, or something to that effect.\n\n533\n00:26:42.019 --> 00:26:47.072\nSo we can say that, that's something\nthat I know that we need to go ahead,\n\n534\n00:26:47.072 --> 00:26:51.165\nand I start categorizing things\nas with the pink category.\n\n535\n00:26:51.165 --> 00:26:54.606\nAnd know so that way you can rename\nthe ones that are already there,\n\n536\n00:26:54.606 --> 00:26:56.339\nmake your own, you can go crazy.\n\n537\n00:26:56.339 --> 00:26:59.747\nAnd then once you start going ahead and\nsaying, yep,\n\n538\n00:26:59.747 --> 00:27:04.685\nyou're going to have a category of Half\ntime event, and then we go with that.\n\n539\n00:27:04.685 --> 00:27:08.109\nSuper cool,\nI really like the color coding part of it.\n\n540\n00:27:08.109 --> 00:27:12.974\nLike I said, the only part that's not\nthe best is that you can't just come over\n\n541\n00:27:12.974 --> 00:27:16.824\nhere to your search and say,\npull up everything that is pink.\n\n542\n00:27:16.824 --> 00:27:21.830\nThere is, I'm giving you a little\ntoo much of the next episode,\n\n543\n00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:25.923\nbut there is one that's if\nyou use the right search.\n\n544\n00:27:25.923 --> 00:27:27.747\n&gt;&gt; Parameters?\n&gt;&gt; Parameters, there you go.\n\n545\n00:27:27.747 --> 00:27:32.195\nThe kind of key words you are going\nto say, and know how to type it in,\n\n546\n00:27:32.195 --> 00:27:33.458\nthen you can do it.\n\n547\n00:27:33.458 --> 00:27:37.180\nBut that's okay, I've got a website for\nyou, and I'll let you know,\n\n548\n00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.869\nI've got your back on that one.\n\n549\n00:27:38.869 --> 00:27:41.438\nSo, but I think that's it for\nthis particular episode,\n\n550\n00:27:41.438 --> 00:27:43.158\nbecause I know you're saying, hey!\n\n551\n00:27:43.158 --> 00:27:44.300\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:52.342\nWe would go on over a lot of\nthose different techniques,\n\n16\n00:00:52.342 --> 00:00:56.248\nor different ways that you can go\nahead and make yourself organized.\n\n17\n00:00:56.248 --> 00:00:59.616\nAnd we had actually left\noff with categories.\n\n18\n00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:03.647\nAnd there's actually a few more things\nthat I wanna talk to you guys about\n\n19\n00:01:03.647 --> 00:01:08.270\ncategories, because this series does\ncover everything of Outlook on the Web.\n\n20\n00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.810\nAnd so, that way we have our paid\nversions and our free versions, and\n\n21\n00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.508\nup until this point,\neverything has been the same.\n\n22\n00:01:14.508 --> 00:01:19.100\nAnd actually, everything past this\npoint is gonna be the same in both\n\n23\n00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.810\nversions as well, except for\nthis one little section of categories.\n\n24\n00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.020\nSo I wanna go ahead and pick that up here.\n\n25\n00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.040\nNow I'm back here with Justin's,\nnope, not Justin, this is Joey.\n\n26\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.845\nAll right, we've got his inbox right here,\nand we have it focused.\n\n27\n00:01:32.845 --> 00:01:36.580\nAnd just really quickly, wanna let you\nknow that over here on my folder pane over\n\n28\n00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.422\non the left, if you're like,\nthat doesn't look the same,\n\n29\n00:01:39.422 --> 00:01:42.240\nit's because right there,\nI just need to click this More.\n\n30\n00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.498\nAnd then I'll go ahead and\nget me all of them.\n\n31\n00:01:44.498 --> 00:01:48.088\nI had actually clicked this button\nat one point, to kinda say,\n\n32\n00:01:48.088 --> 00:01:51.090\ngo back into the compact view,\nif you wanna call it.\n\n33\n00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.570\nI don't know if that's what its real\nname is, but I'm just letting you know,\n\n34\n00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.440\nif you're kind of wondering about that.\n\n35\n00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.946\nAnd I've done that to myself before,\nI'm like, where's my center?\n\n36\n00:01:59.946 --> 00:02:02.050\nClick the More button and then move on.\n\n37\n00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.286\nSo, more of that customization,\nor anything like that.\n\n38\n00:02:04.286 --> 00:02:08.120\nAll right, so categories, we left off\non how we went ahead and marked it.\n\n39\n00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.036\nWe made a pink category for October for\nBreast Cancer Awareness Month, and\n\n40\n00:02:13.036 --> 00:02:15.777\nthat the boys are gonna be playing a show.\n\n41\n00:02:15.777 --> 00:02:20.550\nNSYNC's gonna come back with a fury,\nand I would be so happy.\n\n42\n00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.070\nAnd so, we've got all of that,\ndifferent ways.\n\n43\n00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.420\nWe talked about how you can't\nfilter it in the paid version,\n\n44\n00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.900\nwhich is really interesting, honestly.\n\n45\n00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.489\nYou can't use the filter\nby a specific category.\n\n46\n00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.340\nYou can on the desktop version,\nit's fantastic.\n\n47\n00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.230\nIt's really, really great.\n\n48\n00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.189\nBut I'm just like, really, why?\n\n49\n00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.110\nAnd you can see forums where\npeople are like, bring it back!\n\n50\n00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.280\nWhat is wrong with you?\n\n51\n00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.930\nThis is a huge thing.\n\n52\n00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.027\nSo you can't search by it,\nbut the thing is, funny,\n\n53\n00:02:47.027 --> 00:02:51.410\nswitch over to the free version,\nthe Outlook.com one.\n\n54\n00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.870\nYou actually have the same\nidea with the categories and\n\n55\n00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.585\neverything, but you can also filter\nby those particular categories.\n\n56\n00:03:00.585 --> 00:03:03.421\nNotice, I have the green category and\norange category.\n\n57\n00:03:03.421 --> 00:03:06.190\nNow this isn't by default though.\n\n58\n00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.570\nYou do have to change this.\n\n59\n00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.469\nSo if you come over here\ninto your settings, and\n\n60\n00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:14.818\nnotice with the free version instead\nof the little pane that comes out,\n\n61\n00:03:14.818 --> 00:03:19.312\nit's just a drop down, and I come\ninto options, same options over here,\n\n62\n00:03:19.312 --> 00:03:22.740\nexcept that in the mail layout\nthere is the categories.\n\n63\n00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.170\nCool, so you can see,\nshow the category column the message list.\n\n64\n00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.259\nNow, this is where there's\na little twist in this one.\n\n65\n00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:33.478\nDon't you love it when you go ahead and\ncheck these boxes off and\n\n66\n00:03:33.478 --> 00:03:35.200\nit will work, right?\n\n67\n00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.665\nAnd then you can't make it\nwork to save your life.\n\n68\n00:03:38.665 --> 00:03:42.060\n[LAUGH] And I've spent, I'm telling you-\n&gt;&gt; Countless hours.\n\n69\n00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.210\n&gt;&gt; Countless hours going through, trying\nto do all different types of strings,\n\n70\n00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.710\nand how to try to find this in Google,\ncategories aren't showing,\n\n71\n00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.610\nso on and so forth.\n\n72\n00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.320\nJust keep that in mind for a second,\nand I'll come back around.\n\n73\n00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.110\nBecause right here it says, categories,\n\n74\n00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.920\nshow this in the category\ncolumn in the message list.\n\n75\n00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.267\nCool, and they had these, contacts,\nbills, photos, and all that,\n\n76\n00:04:05.267 --> 00:04:08.542\nthose were all pre-made in\nthis version of Outlook.\n\n77\n00:04:08.542 --> 00:04:13.402\nSo I was like, cool, show in the folder\npane, and then show in the filter.\n\n78\n00:04:13.402 --> 00:04:16.225\nOkay, cool,\nthat was that drop down that I showed you.\n\n79\n00:04:16.225 --> 00:04:17.370\nIt wasn't by default.\n\n80\n00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.150\nI had to check this off, so\nthese are pre-made ones.\n\n81\n00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.397\nNow, the ones down here, we still have\nthe whole option of coming into here, and\n\n82\n00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:27.159\nthen we could also,\nthat's not the right-click.\n\n83\n00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:29.427\nI'm sorry, wrong version.\nI was gonna try and do the rename, but\n\n84\n00:04:29.427 --> 00:04:32.530\nwe could always add more,\ndelete the ones that we don't like.\n\n85\n00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.274\nAnd we could make a pink category,\ngive it a name, show in the pane,\n\n86\n00:04:36.274 --> 00:04:38.790\nall that kind of good stuff, right?\n\n87\n00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.930\nSo I could make my own categories for\nphotos, documents, and so on and so forth.\n\n88\n00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.144\nBut you're like, it's already there,\nit should show up.\n\n89\n00:04:46.144 --> 00:04:48.405\nOkay, it says, we all see that, right?\n\n90\n00:04:48.405 --> 00:04:50.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Really zooming in.\n\n91\n00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.978\n&gt;&gt; Show in the category column.\n\n92\n00:04:51.978 --> 00:04:54.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'm not doing any changes to words,\n\n93\n00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.260\nso I don't have to save.\n\n94\n00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.450\nSo let me leave my options,\nwe select this, we come to categorize.\n\n95\n00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.110\nThere's nothing in there that\nsays anything about documents or\n\n96\n00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.450\nphotos, all the things that I had checked\non in my settings to say go ahead and\n\n97\n00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.050\nshow in the column, it won't do it.\n\n98\n00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.456\n&gt;&gt; So it's a liar?\n\n99\n00:05:12.456 --> 00:05:18.208\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I thought maybe it's the browser,\nwent into Edge.\n\n100\n00:05:18.208 --> 00:05:19.348\nIt didn't work.\n\n101\n00:05:19.348 --> 00:05:22.670\nIt won't show me it.\n\n102\n00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:23.597\nI'm not sure-\n&gt;&gt; I didn't wanna do it anyway,\n\n103\n00:05:23.597 --> 00:05:24.140\nso how about that?\n\n104\n00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n105\n00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.567\nI'm just gonna go ahead and make my own.\n\n106\n00:05:26.567 --> 00:05:28.240\nI'm not going to use your pre-made one.\n\n107\n00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.152\n&gt;&gt; Take my categories and go home.\n\n108\n00:05:29.152 --> 00:05:32.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, there is a work-around.\n\n109\n00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.930\nYou make your own photos category.\n\n110\n00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.340\nBut I just thought it was so strange,\n\n111\n00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.450\ncuz I'm looking at forms, I'm looking\nat instructions, and it's like see?\n\n112\n00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.722\nYou just click it and\nshows it in the screenshots.\n\n113\n00:05:42.722 --> 00:05:43.550\nI'm not sure.\n\n114\n00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.380\nI honestly can't tell you why.\n\n115\n00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.335\nSo if yours are showing in those\npre-made ones, more power to you.\n\n116\n00:05:49.335 --> 00:05:51.740\n[LAUGH] Cuz that's awesome.\n\n117\n00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.685\nI can't make it work, so.\n\n118\n00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:55.615\nBut notice that over here\nin my folder pane now,\n\n119\n00:05:55.615 --> 00:05:57.800\nif I wanted to click on the family.\n\n120\n00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.280\nI think the green category is the one.\n\n121\n00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.810\nCuz I couldn't get the family or\ndocuments to work.\n\n122\n00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.513\nBut you can see, I went ahead and\n\n123\n00:06:03.513 --> 00:06:07.440\nadded some of my messages with the green\ncategory, and so on and so forth.\n\n124\n00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.003\nSo, wanna through that out,\n\n125\n00:06:10.003 --> 00:06:15.443\nas a kind of caveat of Outlook.com\nversus paid Office 365.\n\n126\n00:06:15.443 --> 00:06:20.357\nThat's the only variation I've seen so\nfar of what we're talking about in\n\n127\n00:06:20.357 --> 00:06:25.362\nthese episodes, which is the organizing,\ncustomizing, search, my.\n\n128\n00:06:25.362 --> 00:06:29.351\nAll right, we've got one other\nthing about categories and\n\n129\n00:06:29.351 --> 00:06:32.062\nthen we can move on to the next one.\n\n130\n00:06:32.062 --> 00:06:36.040\nNotice that if I'm in the message list,\n\n131\n00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.590\nthis is the only place where you could\ngo ahead and mark your categories.\n\n132\n00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.890\nIf I open this, I double click on this and\nI open this up.\n\n133\n00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:51.970\nNotice there is no mark as category in\nthe window, or the message that is opened.\n\n134\n00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.400\nIn the reading pane or,\nin a sense, a new window, so\n\n135\n00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.480\nyou gotta have it in the message list\nof how you can go ahead and apply it.\n\n136\n00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.970\nMore organization techniques,\nover here in my folder pane,\n\n137\n00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.245\nnotice that I have the Joey Fatone.\n\n138\n00:07:06.245 --> 00:07:07.200\nThat's the main one.\n\n139\n00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.950\nAnd I have the inbox, but there's a\nlittle, little triangle right next to it.\n\n140\n00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.970\nWhat that means is there's\nmore folders in here.\n\n141\n00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.058\nNotice, there's a JT folder and\nthere's a Lance folder.\n\n142\n00:07:17.058 --> 00:07:19.380\nYou're like,\ndid that make it automatically?\n\n143\n00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.720\nNo, I did that, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.110\nI did that in my desktop version-\n&gt;&gt; It'd be a strange thing for\n\n145\n00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.279\nMicrosoft to put in by default.\n\n146\n00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:24.932\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n147\n00:07:24.932 --> 00:07:25.717\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like,\n\n148\n00:07:25.717 --> 00:07:27.250\nhow did it know I would talk about some.\n\n149\n00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.580\nI mean, these intelligence services,\nthey get a little scary sometimes.\n\n150\n00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.070\nWow, you guys are really smart.\n\n151\n00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.861\nAnd then sometimes you're like no,\nyou're really not smart.\n\n152\n00:07:35.861 --> 00:07:36.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n153\n00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.892\nyou have these different\nfolders that you can make.\n\n154\n00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:44.840\nAnd again, you wanna go ahead and make\nfolders for every single thing you do.\n\n155\n00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.620\nGo right ahead.\n\n156\n00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.008\nAnd then you can move\nyour messages into them.\n\n157\n00:07:49.008 --> 00:07:52.768\nI know people that live and\nbreathe by this technique,\n\n158\n00:07:52.768 --> 00:07:56.934\nwhere I'm going to make a folder for\nA class, or a person, or\n\n159\n00:07:56.934 --> 00:08:00.710\nan event, or\nhowever you want to go ahead and do it.\n\n160\n00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.639\nAnd all the messages that come into\nthe main box, I then filter or\n\n161\n00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:09.100\ncatalog it away into their own folders.\n\n162\n00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.390\nSo that way I can come over to the folder\nand now I have everything that's in\n\n163\n00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:17.228\nthe J.T. folder, or in the Lance, I guess\nLance doesn't have anything, sorry.\n\n164\n00:08:17.228 --> 00:08:19.516\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you can go ahead and\n\n165\n00:08:19.516 --> 00:08:25.690\njust have it that way, so it's not in\nthe main box, it's in the subfolder box.\n\n166\n00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:26.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, simple.\n\n167\n00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and now, you can also have\nit in the same line of the inbox,\n\n168\n00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.076\nso it really just depends on\nhow much you want to nest.\n\n169\n00:08:35.076 --> 00:08:35.615\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n170\n00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:39.928\n&gt;&gt; Or how much down you wanna go,\nbecause you might have JT, and\n\n171\n00:08:39.928 --> 00:08:43.502\nthen two folders under JT for\nVMA's and tour bus.\n\n172\n00:08:43.502 --> 00:08:50.714\nAnd it's completely up to you how deep, or\nhow not deep, shallow you want this to go.\n\n173\n00:08:50.714 --> 00:08:52.890\nWell then how did you do that?\n\n174\n00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.210\nUp here at the top where\nit says Joey Fatone,\n\n175\n00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:59.390\nnotice there's a plus sign right next\nto it and it says create new folder.\n\n176\n00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.321\nSo if I click on this, and then add it,\n\n177\n00:09:02.321 --> 00:09:06.811\nknows it adds it down to the bottom\nwithin all of these, and\n\n178\n00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:12.236\nI can type in Organize, organize,\nthere we go, hit enter to accept.\n\n179\n00:09:12.236 --> 00:09:16.990\nAnd now it scroll, its down here,\nso this is off like the main line.\n\n180\n00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:20.160\nWell what if I wanted to\nput this in the inbox?\n\n181\n00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.230\nIt's really distracting drop, okay.\n\n182\n00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.280\nSo I'm gonna just scroll\nup just a little bit, okay,\n\n183\n00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.890\nwe're gonna grab this, click hold,\ndrag up, up, up, up, up.\n\n184\n00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.530\nYou do have to watch,\nI wanna get into like right there,\n\n185\n00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.010\nit's like kind of highlighting over inbox.\n\n186\n00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.400\nYou don't wanna kind of come out too far,\nand\n\n187\n00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:43.340\nwhen I let go notice that it then drops\nit down into the inbox under Organize.\n\n188\n00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:48.940\nIf I wanted to put Organize into the JT\nfolder, notice that now the JT folder,\n\n189\n00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:53.250\nso this is the levels that you need or\nwant to be able to do it.\n\n190\n00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:58.925\nAnd then if I wanted to take\nmessages from my main inbox and\n\n191\n00:09:58.925 --> 00:10:03.666\nput them into there you can drag and\ndrop again.\n\n192\n00:10:03.666 --> 00:10:07.418\nOr you can also use the move to,\nand then go ahead and\n\n193\n00:10:07.418 --> 00:10:11.014\nfind the folder that you\nwant it to move to there.\n\n194\n00:10:11.014 --> 00:10:16.840\nI tend to like the drag and drop one,\njust cuz it just feels better.\n\n195\n00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.950\nAnd you can have this on\nmultiple selected emails,\n\n196\n00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.580\nit just depends on how you want to do it.\n\n197\n00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.810\nSo I will just take this, click hold,\ndrag, hover over organize, and\n\n198\n00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:31.390\nnow you can see when I click on there,\nthere you go, there's where my email goes.\n\n199\n00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:36.120\nReally like that feature, I know people\nthat this is the only thing they do,\n\n200\n00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.890\nthey don't use any flags or anything else,\nthey just use the folder options.\n\n201\n00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.380\nSo you could go ahead and do all those.\n\n202\n00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.704\nNow if you're thinking,\nwell what if I just wanna go ahead and\n\n203\n00:10:44.704 --> 00:10:45.740\nmake that automatically.\n\n204\n00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:50.290\nLike anytime an email from Justin, with\nthis subject comes in I wanna go ahead and\n\n205\n00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.490\nmove it into that.\n\n206\n00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.440\nThat's another level, or not a level,\n\n207\n00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.550\nanother episode honestly,\nit's into writing rules.\n\n208\n00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; To say if this happens, then do this.\n\n209\n00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:03.916\nSo, lots of fun stuff with how you\ncan automate some of these features.\n\n210\n00:11:03.916 --> 00:11:06.350\nAnd the other thing you\ncould do if you wanted to,\n\n211\n00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.280\nthere is a whole part up\nhere with favorites, right.\n\n212\n00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.200\nMaybe my organize folder is something\nthat I'd always like to see, so\n\n213\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.210\nyou just go ahead, and notice we hover\nover it, there's a little star next to it.\n\n214\n00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:22.350\nYou click on the star, and\nnow the stared items go in my favorites,\n\n215\n00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.140\nso then I can just quickly go here.\n\n216\n00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:30.960\nIt's moving anything, it's just an alias,\na short cut into your favorites.\n\n217\n00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.147\nWe have those with our favorites bar,\nand all of like the bookmarks bar.\n\n218\n00:11:34.147 --> 00:11:39.647\nSo that should be somewhat more of\na familiar things to people that use,\n\n219\n00:11:39.647 --> 00:11:40.965\nwell anything.\n\n220\n00:11:40.965 --> 00:11:43.020\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anything with favorites.\n\n221\n00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, so it's along those same lines.\n\n222\n00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.091\nAnd of course you can always remove\nit from the Favorites as well,\n\n223\n00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:50.374\nif you take the star off,\nyou could just take that.\n\n224\n00:11:50.374 --> 00:11:54.266\nDo you want to remove it from there,\nyou click OK, and then it takes it off.\n\n225\n00:11:54.266 --> 00:11:56.400\nSo different ways that you can do that.\n\n226\n00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.670\nAll right, so\nlet's move on to some customizing.\n\n227\n00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.820\nNow you're like, well we've been\ncustomizing this whole time,\n\n228\n00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.355\nI would call those organizing techniques.\n\n229\n00:12:06.355 --> 00:12:12.905\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, customizing is creating something\nnew that's specific to you, right?\n\n230\n00:12:12.905 --> 00:12:16.208\n&gt;&gt; Yes, or\ntaking what my interface looks like.\n\n231\n00:12:16.208 --> 00:12:18.536\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And changing the settings.\n\n232\n00:12:18.536 --> 00:12:19.419\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n233\n00:12:19.419 --> 00:12:21.408\n&gt;&gt; So, that's what were gonna go over.\n\n234\n00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:22.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n235\n00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:26.928\n&gt;&gt; So why don't we come into\nthe settings here, and we'll go over to,\n\n236\n00:12:26.928 --> 00:12:28.358\nwhere are we going?\n\n237\n00:12:28.358 --> 00:12:30.200\n[LAUGH] Let me look at my notes.\n\n238\n00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.590\nSo let's go to, well some of this\nstuff we've already gone over.\n\n239\n00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:37.740\nWe've gone over the display settings,\nand about the reading pane.\n\n240\n00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.930\nAnd up in the display settings you can\nsee that you have like the message list.\n\n241\n00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.520\nThis is one that we might not\nhave gone over too much, but\n\n242\n00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.100\nnotice we have the sender name first.\n\n243\n00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.570\nWell, maybe you don't want that\nbecause it's saying Justin Timberlake,\n\n244\n00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.360\nmaybe you want the subject to be first.\n\n245\n00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.590\nAnd you can even see it kinda ghosted\nback over there, so that's one that,\n\n246\n00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.770\nand I remember I've shown some people,\nthat's where that thing is.\n\n247\n00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.740\nYep, okay, cool, and\n\n248\n00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.800\nthen there's also the preview text,\ndo you want that there or not?\n\n249\n00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.460\nWe can hide that, and so\nnow it just kind of compacts everything.\n\n250\n00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.080\nAnd we can do that,\nlet's click okay just so you can see it.\n\n251\n00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.700\nAnd so there you go, it's the subject,\nnot the sender that is on top.\n\n252\n00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.460\nSo that's some customization there for us.\n\n253\n00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.980\nWe also talked about,\n\n254\n00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.590\nor maybe we've talked about in the\nconversations from the display settings.\n\n255\n00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:30.763\nDo you want your newest messages\non the top or the bottom, so\n\n256\n00:13:30.763 --> 00:13:33.610\nthat's a setting that you can go there.\n\n257\n00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.319\nAnd then do you wanna have\nit show deleted items,\n\n258\n00:13:36.319 --> 00:13:39.505\nnow if you have your inbox set\nup to show as conversation.\n\n259\n00:13:39.505 --> 00:13:42.625\nIf you don't have it showing\na conversation this means nothing to you.\n\n260\n00:13:42.625 --> 00:13:44.175\nAnd then of course we have our focus,\nwhether or\n\n261\n00:13:44.175 --> 00:13:47.690\nnot you wanted to turn off the focus\ninbox, you could do it here,\n\n262\n00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:52.375\nit's also in that drop down from\nthe filtering, so that's one.\n\n263\n00:13:52.375 --> 00:13:55.770\nThis is something that once I found this\n\n264\n00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.230\nit was just like my gosh that's\nall I've been wanting to do.\n\n265\n00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.920\nAnd I've kind of been hiding it from\ny'all if you've been watching this in\n\n266\n00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.440\nsuccession.\n\n267\n00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.630\nTo get to this particular episode,\nyou're like what are you talking about?\n\n268\n00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.600\nLet me show you.\n\n269\n00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.714\nIf I click the new, notice that the new\ncomes in the reading pane, right.\n\n270\n00:14:11.714 --> 00:14:16.590\nOr if I had the reading pane\noff it was always in the space.\n\n271\n00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.230\nAnd I always come up to this little box\nright here and say, I just wanna put it in\n\n272\n00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.912\na separate window because I wanna,\nyou've probably watched me do this.\n\n273\n00:14:22.912 --> 00:14:24.116\n&gt;&gt; A bunch of times.\n\n274\n00:14:24.116 --> 00:14:27.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know what there's\na setting that you can-\n\n275\n00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.215\n&gt;&gt; That changes this?\n\n276\n00:14:28.215 --> 00:14:30.363\n&gt;&gt; Yes, my gosh.\n\n277\n00:14:30.363 --> 00:14:31.503\n&gt;&gt; You wrote them a nasty gram,\ndidn't you?\n\n278\n00:14:31.503 --> 00:14:34.334\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n279\n00:14:34.334 --> 00:14:36.396\n&gt;&gt; Man, it was really more of those like,\nthat's where that thing is.\n\n280\n00:14:36.396 --> 00:14:37.821\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n281\n00:14:37.821 --> 00:14:42.340\nI'm gonna tell you why it\ntook me awhile to find this.\n\n282\n00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.915\nBecause if we go back into,\ncuz it's a reading pane.\n\n283\n00:14:44.915 --> 00:14:47.134\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking it's a reading pane thing,\n\n284\n00:14:47.134 --> 00:14:50.870\nwell, okay come to display settings,\nand you see, okay you don't see,\n\n285\n00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.660\nalright it says something\nabout deleted items.\n\n286\n00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:58.510\nOkay, you're selected, all right,\nwhere the, okay, fine, that's great.\n\n287\n00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.191\nBut look at this, if I click OK,\nscroll down to the bottom, and\n\n288\n00:15:02.191 --> 00:15:06.369\nat the bottom you have where it's\na little behind the head right there.\n\n289\n00:15:06.369 --> 00:15:09.428\nYou can see your app settings,\nyou can see that you have mail and\n\n290\n00:15:09.428 --> 00:15:11.870\nwe've gone to this place\nquite a few sometimes.\n\n291\n00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.020\nAnd then over here in the left we have,\nwhere are you?\n\n292\n00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.650\nWe have the layout, and\nwe have the reading pane, look at that.\n\n293\n00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.290\nChoose what happens, wrong one.\n\n294\n00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:25.953\nChoose whether to write messages\nin the reading pane, or\n\n295\n00:15:25.953 --> 00:15:27.947\na new window, really, yeah.\n\n296\n00:15:27.947 --> 00:15:28.705\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n297\n00:15:28.705 --> 00:15:33.657\ndid you notice that when we were in\ndisplay settings, no, it's not in there.\n\n298\n00:15:33.657 --> 00:15:37.687\nYou had to go into like the mail,\ninto the layout, into the reading pane,\n\n299\n00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:39.192\nso it's like wait, what!\n\n300\n00:15:39.192 --> 00:15:41.850\n&gt;&gt; Cuz somebody's brain works\ndifferent than yours, Vaughn.\n\n301\n00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.258\n&gt;&gt; Well that's just wrong.\n\n302\n00:15:43.258 --> 00:15:45.147\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At least in this sense, right?\n\n303\n00:15:45.147 --> 00:15:47.213\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's just, to me it's like it\njust seems like the reading pane to be.\n\n304\n00:15:47.213 --> 00:15:49.407\n&gt;&gt; It makes it more intuitively to be-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n305\n00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:52.561\nand it's like you have the reading pane\nand the reading pane in different places,\n\n306\n00:15:52.561 --> 00:15:54.220\nyou would think you have the same options.\n\n307\n00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:54.920\n&gt;&gt; You would think.\n\n308\n00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.250\n&gt;&gt; You would think, all right.\n\n309\n00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.620\nBut you know what, that's why you have me.\n\n310\n00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:58.896\n&gt;&gt; Don't believe everything\nyou think there, Vonne.\n\n311\n00:15:58.896 --> 00:16:03.108\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if I could just turn this on, and\n\n312\n00:16:03.108 --> 00:16:07.821\nthis could be whether you have\nthe reading pane off or on.\n\n313\n00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:12.309\nWhen you Save this, and\nI come out to right here, and\n\n314\n00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:17.205\nI click there, I'm like,\nyay, [LAUGH] I'm so happy.\n\n315\n00:16:17.205 --> 00:16:18.179\nIt's the small things.\n\n316\n00:16:18.179 --> 00:16:19.678\n&gt;&gt; It's the little things that get you.\n\n317\n00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:20.574\n&gt;&gt; It's always that way.\n\n318\n00:16:20.574 --> 00:16:26.353\nSo I wanted to let you all know that\nthere, cuz it's a big one for me.\n\n319\n00:16:26.353 --> 00:16:29.115\nLet's go over a few\nother settings in here.\n\n320\n00:16:29.115 --> 00:16:32.545\nWe'll come back over into our General.\n\n321\n00:16:32.545 --> 00:16:36.333\nWhen I come down to the bottom and\nwe go to Mail, we have some General.\n\n322\n00:16:36.333 --> 00:16:40.290\nAgain, I know we've gone over\nsome of this in other places.\n\n323\n00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:41.554\nChanging your theme.\n\n324\n00:16:41.554 --> 00:16:45.496\nYou don't want the blue theme,\nyou want some crayons, or hey,\n\n325\n00:16:45.496 --> 00:16:47.548\nhow about some clouds and stars?\n\n326\n00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:48.542\nWe'll go with that.\n\n327\n00:16:48.542 --> 00:16:50.721\nKitty meow, there we go,\n[LAUGH] I have to.\n\n328\n00:16:50.721 --> 00:16:52.186\n&gt;&gt; Again, you sent them a letter,\ndidn't you?\n\n329\n00:16:52.186 --> 00:16:55.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is my personal account.\n\n330\n00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.488\nI think you guys have already\nheard me say that, so [LAUGH].\n\n331\n00:16:58.488 --> 00:17:02.684\nAnd keyboard shortcuts,\nlet me go ahead and save my changes there.\n\n332\n00:17:02.684 --> 00:17:04.592\nCuz I am doing some theme things.\n\n333\n00:17:04.592 --> 00:17:09.576\nSo if you do use keyboard shortcuts,\nyou can use the same ones\n\n334\n00:17:09.576 --> 00:17:14.386\nthat you use for Gmail and for\nYahoo, so you could do that.\n\n335\n00:17:14.386 --> 00:17:19.692\nIn the web version, I'm not as shortcutty\nas I normally am in desktop version.\n\n336\n00:17:19.692 --> 00:17:22.100\nSo, just wanted to throw\nthat out to you guys.\n\n337\n00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:22.610\nAnd of course,\n\n338\n00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:26.570\nyou also have your region and time zone,\nif for any reason you need to change that.\n\n339\n00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:31.483\nA few other ones in\nthe automatic settings.\n\n340\n00:17:31.483 --> 00:17:36.042\nThis is something that we did\nnot cover in the read receipts.\n\n341\n00:17:36.042 --> 00:17:40.191\nI think this was advanced mail features\nthat we did, to where we, yes,\n\n342\n00:17:40.191 --> 00:17:41.150\nokay, sorry.\n\n343\n00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:46.220\n[LAUGH] I keep doing things that it needs\nto, it needs to go ahead and redo itself.\n\n344\n00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.190\nCome on back.\n\n345\n00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.950\nThere we go.\n\n346\n00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.530\nRead receipts.\n\n347\n00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:50.740\nAnd it's thinking.\n\n348\n00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.020\nIt's getting there.\n\n349\n00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:52.650\n&gt;&gt; It'll happen.\n\n350\n00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:53.700\n&gt;&gt; It'll happen.\n\n351\n00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.360\nCome on, you can do it.\n\n352\n00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.000\nThere we go.\n\n353\n00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.950\nSo in read receipts, this is where we\nhave the always send a response or\n\n354\n00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:03.000\nnever send a response, or\nask me every single time.\n\n355\n00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.210\nI'm not, and this is where we said I\ncould just go ahead and ignore them.\n\n356\n00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.700\nYou could always ignore them.\n\n357\n00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So this could be a universal setting of\n\n358\n00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.800\nalways send it or not ever send it,\nask me every single time.\n\n359\n00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.480\n&gt;&gt; I got actually,\nI didn't get in trouble, but\n\n360\n00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.532\nI got talked to about this setting at\na job I work at because I had it set,\n\n361\n00:18:21.532 --> 00:18:24.035\nI think by default it\nwas ask me every time.\n\n362\n00:18:24.035 --> 00:18:26.890\nAnd I just was like,\nI don't wanna do these things.\n\n363\n00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.020\nAnd I unchecked it.\n\n364\n00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.986\nI changed setting to never.\n\n365\n00:18:28.986 --> 00:18:30.964\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then someone was like I'm never\n\n366\n00:18:30.964 --> 00:18:32.570\ngetting read receipts from you.\n\n367\n00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:33.420\nAnd I'm like, yeah, so?\n\n368\n00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.650\nI need to know when you read that.\n\n369\n00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.075\nI'm like, didn't say that in the e-mail.\n\n370\n00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:37.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n371\n00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.250\nwe talked about that as workflow policy.\n\n372\n00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.150\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nyou need to make them this setting change.\n\n373\n00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well that's not fun.\n\n374\n00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.321\n&gt;&gt; So I just stopped reading e-mails.\n\n375\n00:18:50.321 --> 00:18:51.733\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n376\n00:18:51.733 --> 00:18:52.314\nGoodness.\n\n377\n00:18:52.314 --> 00:18:54.220\n&gt;&gt; Take that.\n\n378\n00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.600\n&gt;&gt; As we keep on going through\nsome of these that reply settings\n\n379\n00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.480\nto where it's always like\nthe Reply All versus Reply.\n\n380\n00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.230\nAgain, we're doing a little bit more of\na review, but keeping it all together.\n\n381\n00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.000\nThe Attachment options.\n\n382\n00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.850\nThis is one that I\nthought was interesting.\n\n383\n00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:11.620\nSo you come over here to the Attachment\noptions because this is where when we\n\n384\n00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.615\ntalked about, well, attaching files,\nthe different ways that you could do it.\n\n385\n00:19:15.615 --> 00:19:19.734\nAnd I like that now it says the whole,\nlike it says do you wanna attach them as\n\n386\n00:19:19.734 --> 00:19:23.650\na OneDrive file, like upload it up to your\nOneDrive, and then given them a link.\n\n387\n00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.440\nOr do you wanna send them as copies?\n\n388\n00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.480\nSo this is where, from your computer,\nfrom OneDrive, and from groups,\n\n389\n00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.630\nwhich we have a whole thing on groups.\n\n390\n00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.386\nYou can set the defaults of\nhow you want it to happen.\n\n391\n00:19:35.386 --> 00:19:36.685\nCuz that’s the other thing to me.\n\n392\n00:19:36.685 --> 00:19:38.240\nIt's like I’m pretty much always, for\n\n393\n00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.810\nme, I'm always gonna want\nto send it as a copy.\n\n394\n00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:44.985\nI wanna send you the actual file,\nfor the most part.\n\n395\n00:19:44.985 --> 00:19:48.405\nSo that's where I might wanna come in and\nchange these.\n\n396\n00:19:48.405 --> 00:19:51.685\nBut then, of course, as soon as a change\nit to an absolute there's always that\n\n397\n00:19:51.685 --> 00:19:54.894\nwell, now I need to set it\nback to ask me every time.\n\n398\n00:19:54.894 --> 00:19:55.547\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n399\n00:19:55.547 --> 00:19:58.368\nI wanted to point that\none out to you guys.\n\n400\n00:19:58.368 --> 00:20:03.327\nThen in the layout, into here,\nwe've talked a lot about some of these.\n\n401\n00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:04.920\nThere's where our signatures are.\n\n402\n00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.570\nThe two that I wanted to point\nout were the quick actions.\n\n403\n00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:12.580\nThis is when we do the hovering over\nthe message in the message list.\n\n404\n00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.370\nThose little icons that come up,\nthat we could use the Pin, or\n\n405\n00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.355\nthe flag, or the Delete.\n\n406\n00:20:18.355 --> 00:20:20.592\nWell, you can actually change them.\n\n407\n00:20:20.592 --> 00:20:23.872\nSo you could have an Archive\ninstead of Delete.\n\n408\n00:20:23.872 --> 00:20:28.001\nYou can have it Move, or you could just\nhave it do nothing, you don't want this\n\n409\n00:20:28.001 --> 00:20:32.655\nand you want these blanks, you don't like\nthe hover buttons and the quick actions.\n\n410\n00:20:32.655 --> 00:20:35.395\nThought that was kind of interesting.\n\n411\n00:20:35.395 --> 00:20:38.570\nThen the other one we\nhave is message format.\n\n412\n00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:44.003\nIf you wanted to change your default\nfont for your messages, if you wanted\n\n413\n00:20:44.003 --> 00:20:49.567\nit to not be Calibri, you always want it\nto be Comic Sans, purple, 24 point font.\n\n414\n00:20:49.567 --> 00:20:54.647\n&gt;&gt; That sounds awesomely bad.\n\n415\n00:20:54.647 --> 00:21:02.165\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've had some e-mails where it's\nlike, you found the change default font.\n\n416\n00:21:02.165 --> 00:21:03.820\n&gt;&gt; You've been playing with things.\n\n417\n00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:04.322\nCause it's fun.\n\n418\n00:21:04.322 --> 00:21:04.883\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n419\n00:21:04.883 --> 00:21:06.612\n&gt;&gt; Until you ruin things.\n\n420\n00:21:06.612 --> 00:21:10.246\n&gt;&gt; Until it becomes a little obnoxious,\neven by my standards,\n\n421\n00:21:10.246 --> 00:21:11.969\nwhich we've talked about.\n\n422\n00:21:11.969 --> 00:21:13.410\n&gt;&gt; Which is very lenient.\n\n423\n00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:19.330\n&gt;&gt; I love sparkly glitter,\nrainbow, unicorns, I want it all.\n\n424\n00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:20.710\nBut, then I want.\n\n425\n00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:24.015\n&gt;&gt; Why is this two sentence\ne-mail from Vonne 7 megs?\n\n426\n00:21:24.015 --> 00:21:25.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n427\n00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.880\n&gt;&gt; So\nI would probably keep it professional and\n\n428\n00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.040\nall-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n429\n00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.180\n&gt;&gt; But maybe instead of Calibri you want-\n&gt;&gt; Know your audience.\n\n430\n00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.220\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n431\n00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.300\nKnow your target audience, for sure.\n\n432\n00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:37.990\nSo we've got that.\n\n433\n00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:41.550\nAnd we did talk about this in our\nmessage formats and everything to that.\n\n434\n00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.110\nAnd all the settings that we're doing\nright now is the same in Outlook.com.\n\n435\n00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:48.515\nThe only thing would be that we\nhad that categories in the Layout.\n\n436\n00:21:48.515 --> 00:21:52.390\nThen lastly, the Search.\n\n437\n00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:56.780\nThis is where it gets a little [LAUGH]\n\n438\n00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.830\nonly because the Search in\nthe desktop version is so extensive.\n\n439\n00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:01.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, there's so\n\n440\n00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:02.750\nmany things you can do.\n\n441\n00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.050\n&gt;&gt; It's really nice.\n\n442\n00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:04.660\n&gt;&gt; It's beautiful, right?\n\n443\n00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.038\n&gt;&gt; Like a very nice search.\n\n444\n00:22:06.038 --> 00:22:09.390\n&gt;&gt; And you could say I want it to be\nfrom this person with attachments,\n\n445\n00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.870\ncoded with this category,\nand what have you.\n\n446\n00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:15.370\nYou can put all these love it.\n\n447\n00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:16.880\n&gt;&gt; Stewed to a perfection.\n\n448\n00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.050\n&gt;&gt; And it's not nearly\nthe same in the web version.\n\n449\n00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.960\nIt's way more limited.\n\n450\n00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:27.240\nSo that's the one that can be\na little disheartening, I would say.\n\n451\n00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.380\nNow in my mail part of the Outlook.\n\n452\n00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.460\nAnd notice,\nit does say search Mail and People.\n\n453\n00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.930\nSo if I'm looking for something\nthat I'm gonna have to type it in.\n\n454\n00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:42.070\nAnd then notice down at the bottom\nit does have Search People.\n\n455\n00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:46.823\nI've already made some\nsearches before here.\n\n456\n00:22:46.823 --> 00:22:49.702\nNotice that it has the VMA lunch tour.\n\n457\n00:22:49.702 --> 00:22:52.890\nSo it's nice that does remember\nthe most recently used.\n\n458\n00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:55.158\n&gt;&gt; Especially if you're like\nwhat was that I searched for\n\n459\n00:22:55.158 --> 00:22:57.610\nthat brought up that e-mail\nof exactly what I needed?\n\n460\n00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:58.770\nThere's my history, sweet.\n\n461\n00:22:58.770 --> 00:22:59.500\nThere it is right there.\n\n462\n00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.060\nClick.\n\n463\n00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I use the history all the time.\n\n464\n00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.150\nI know I was looking at this\none way page yesterday.\n\n465\n00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.090\nSo let me just go, there it is.\n\n466\n00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:09.470\nLove that feature.\n\n467\n00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:11.720\nSo that's very similar to here.\n\n468\n00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.290\nSo you could go ahead and do that.\n\n469\n00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:15.090\nSo you could type in anything.\n\n470\n00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.040\nI could say Excel cuz I now that\nwe have something in there.\n\n471\n00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.520\nNotice that it's automatically saying,\n\n472\n00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.990\nwell, do you want me to\nsearch Excel in the people?\n\n473\n00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:23.410\nNo, just the mail.\n\n474\n00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:27.362\nSo you hit Enter, and\nthen it goes ahead and once it finds this,\n\n475\n00:23:27.362 --> 00:23:31.615\nthere does become this secondary\npain of now you're in the Search,\n\n476\n00:23:31.615 --> 00:23:34.099\ndo you want it to search just the inbox?\n\n477\n00:23:34.099 --> 00:23:36.171\nJust the drafts?\n\n478\n00:23:36.171 --> 00:23:37.225\nThose types of things.\n\n479\n00:23:37.225 --> 00:23:40.014\nSo you can see,\nis it from a certain person?\n\n480\n00:23:40.014 --> 00:23:41.148\nDoes it have with attachment?\n\n481\n00:23:41.148 --> 00:23:46.813\nSo there are some kind of second\nlevel filters or search items.\n\n482\n00:23:46.813 --> 00:23:48.392\n&gt;&gt; Getting more granular.\n\n483\n00:23:48.392 --> 00:23:51.773\n&gt;&gt; Yes, parameters, criteria,\nthat's what I'm looking for.\n\n484\n00:23:51.773 --> 00:23:54.850\nAnd the nice thing is,\nthere's also some names of dates.\n\n485\n00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:58.950\nI know it was in the month\nbetween June 1st and June 25th,\n\n486\n00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:01.000\nor something to that effect.\n\n487\n00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.166\nSo that's kinda nice that you\ncan use a date to kind of,\n\n488\n00:24:05.166 --> 00:24:08.810\nthe granular nature of-\n&gt;&gt; I like the highlighting that it does.\n\n489\n00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:12.200\nIn Excel, it's in yellow,\nof there it is, Excel.\n\n490\n00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.890\nYes, it's kinda drawing your eye\ntoward the pertinent information.\n\n491\n00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:16.600\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, yeah.\n\n492\n00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.760\nSo that is nice.\n\n493\n00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.790\nSo it's like, okay,\nwell this isn't too bad.\n\n494\n00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.440\nIt really isn't, but again,\nwe're on the desktop version.\n\n495\n00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:28.310\n&gt;&gt; When you go from the heights of glory\ndown to just a standard search [LAUGH].\n\n496\n00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:30.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n497\n00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.080\nSo you have those kind of parameters.\n\n498\n00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:37.316\nNow, I don't have the link pulled up\nright now, but it is in the show notes.\n\n499\n00:24:37.316 --> 00:24:41.891\nBecause there is some parameters\nthat you can use like we talked\n\n500\n00:24:41.891 --> 00:24:44.058\nabout the category, right?\n\n501\n00:24:44.058 --> 00:24:45.120\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n502\n00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:51.400\n&gt;&gt; Well, notice right here, I have things\nmarked as a category of band, okay?\n\n503\n00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.259\nSo it's the yellow one.\n\n504\n00:24:53.259 --> 00:24:57.139\nAs long as you type it in Category: and\n\n505\n00:24:57.139 --> 00:25:03.470\nthen the name of the category,\nlike if I did cat, cata [LAUGH].\n\n506\n00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.781\n&gt;&gt; Yes cata-\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about cata,\n\n507\n00:25:05.781 --> 00:25:09.150\ncuz I always put cata with two a's\nin there and it's never right.\n\n508\n00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:12.745\nCategory green, let's see if this work.\n\n509\n00:25:12.745 --> 00:25:13.620\nYeah, there's Rene.\n&gt;&gt; Beautiful.\n\n510\n00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:18.490\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so you just have to put that\nkinda of keyword if you wanna say.\n\n511\n00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:22.870\nI can't, they named it, it's something\nwith SQL, or something with an s in there.\n\n512\n00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:25.224\nLook at the notes and\nyou'll see the link in there.\n\n513\n00:25:25.224 --> 00:25:28.878\nSo you can see the signature\nwith the category of green,\n\n514\n00:25:28.878 --> 00:25:33.450\nyou can search by category,\nyou just have to put it in there.\n\n515\n00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:38.060\nSo that's the only kind of thing\nin there that is a little weird.\n\n516\n00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:42.592\nBut of course, category filterings\nis possible and not without .com.\n\n517\n00:25:42.592 --> 00:25:43.979\nIt's not in here but\n\n518\n00:25:43.979 --> 00:25:48.636\nanyways I wanted to at least show\nyou that the search, it does work.\n\n519\n00:25:48.636 --> 00:25:49.740\nYou kind of have to tweak it.\n\n520\n00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.185\nAnd there's some other keywords,\nlike if you put two colon and\n\n521\n00:25:53.185 --> 00:25:54.620\nthen the person's name.\n\n522\n00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.684\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Then it's gonna search for\n\n523\n00:25:56.684 --> 00:25:59.840\nitems that were to that person or\nfrom colon.\n\n524\n00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:04.325\nSo it's a nice list in that website\nthat gives you those kind of keywords.\n\n525\n00:26:04.325 --> 00:26:05.422\nIn the desktop version,\n\n526\n00:26:05.422 --> 00:26:09.142\nthere's just check boxes that you can use\nin the search tab and it's little easier.\n\n527\n00:26:09.142 --> 00:26:13.400\nSo it's the same idea,\nyou just have to physically type it in.\n\n528\n00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.920\nAnd then of course, it's not in here but\nwe can use the search,\n\n529\n00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:21.650\nso wanted to throw that in there and\nI think that actually covers.\n\n530\n00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:24.000\nSorry, I've been looking at my notes\nas well, but they're extensive notes.\n\n531\n00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.816\n&gt;&gt; Yes, a lot of stuff to go through\nwhen it comes to organizing and\n\n532\n00:26:27.816 --> 00:26:30.600\ndoing searching and categorizations\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n533\n00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.670\n&gt;&gt; So a lot of bells and whistles and\na lot of knobs and stuff to tweak.\n\n534\n00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:37.080\n&gt;&gt; And we kind of were going\nlike this all through it.\n\n535\n00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.220\n&gt;&gt; You don't want to\nforget anything obviously.\n\n536\n00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.369\n&gt;&gt; This is one of those where when I was\nplanning this episode out, it's like,\n\n537\n00:26:42.369 --> 00:26:45.810\nokay, I want to try to keep it logical cuz\nwe had a lot of little things to cover.\n\n538\n00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:47.644\nWe keep going into the settings,\nthen we keep popping out,\n\n539\n00:26:47.644 --> 00:26:48.567\nthen we keep going over here.\n\n540\n00:26:48.567 --> 00:26:53.287\nAnd so it's a lot, but I wanted to\nshow you pretty much everything, so\n\n541\n00:26:53.287 --> 00:26:56.490\nit's like, well,\nI wanna know how to do this.\n\n542\n00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.880\nSo I take that approach,\nand give it to you guys.\n\n543\n00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.768\nAnd hopefully that gives you\na couple of different techniques to\n\n544\n00:27:02.768 --> 00:27:07.499\nhelp you become more organized,\ndo your searching, and be customized.\n\n545\n00:27:07.499 --> 00:27:08.022\nMy.\n\n546\n00:27:08.022 --> 00:27:09.522\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Vonne,\n\n547\n00:27:09.522 --> 00:27:10.810\nI think you did a great job.\n\n548\n00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:11.630\nDon't worry about it.\n\n549\n00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:16.269\nI think it was very thorough and very\nclearly explained as well because I've\n\n550\n00:27:16.269 --> 00:27:20.559\nworked the help desk and got a lot of\nthese calls like, how do I do this?\n\n551\n00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:23.400\nOr this has happened and\nnow I don't like this.\n\n552\n00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.130\nIt's showing me something\nI've never seen before.\n\n553\n00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:26.490\nHow do I turn that off?\n\n554\n00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:30.620\nThis is that show that people that want\nto know how to do those things need to be\n\n555\n00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:34.530\nwatching, so that they can manipulate\ntheir interface to be more efficient for\n\n556\n00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.300\nthemselves inside of their environment.\n\n557\n00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.480\nSo I think you did a fantastic job.\n\n558\n00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.630\nWe appreciate your time and effort.\n\n559\n00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.950\nWe do appreciate you good folks out\nthere watching as well, but guess what?\n\n560\n00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:47.815\nWe've come to the end of another great\nepisode, courtesy of this one over here.\n\n561\n00:27:47.815 --> 00:27:50.470\n[LAUGH] Signing off for OfficePro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n562\n00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:51.261\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne

to another\ngreat episode of Office Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.110\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.070\nit's more in our Outlook\non the Web Series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.320\nAnd joining us back in the studio, and\na little background change for today,\n\n7\n00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.450\nwe like to just jazz it up here from\ntime to time, move things around on you.\n\n8\n00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.630\nBut joining us in this studio\ntoday our good friend Ms.\n\n9\n00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.860\nVonne Smith, obviously,\nVonne how's it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.410\n&gt;&gt; It's going beautifully.\n\n11\n00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.100\n&gt;&gt; Beautifully.\n\n12\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.850\nSo good you can't even speak.\n\n13\n00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.230\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say something about blue,\ncuz we're the blue team today.\n\n14\n00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.330\nWe did not plan that, we just showed up.\n\n15\n00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.170\n&gt;&gt; It's the sympatico vibe we have going.\n\n16\n00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.710\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so change the set,\nbut we've got us in tandem.\n\n17\n00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.460\n&gt;&gt; Consistent.\n\n18\n00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.100\n&gt;&gt; All right so\nwhat are we talking about today, Daniel?\n\n19\n00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.650\nLet me consult my notes.\n\n20\n00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.460\nWe're talking about junk mail.\n\n21\n00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.280\nEverybody's kind of nemesis,\nalmost, right?\n\n22\n00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.700\nYou don't really know what it does and\nthen when it does what it's supposed to\n\n23\n00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.600\ndo, you don't like it, and then you're\nlike, why are you doing this, right?\n\n24\n00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.178\nIt's quite confusing, so we're gonna\ntry to demystify the junk mail.\n\n25\n00:01:22.178 --> 00:01:23.957\nAt least get you into the settings so\n\n26\n00:01:23.957 --> 00:01:27.292\nyou know where you can start maybe\ncontrolling some of this stuff.\n\n27\n00:01:27.292 --> 00:01:32.260\nBut there is that kind of asterisks\nof it's still gonna do somethings\n\n28\n00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.300\nthat you probably are never\ngonna be able to figure out.\n\n29\n00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.992\n&gt;&gt; I see it as the email\nwell meaning spouse, right,\n\n30\n00:01:38.992 --> 00:01:43.567\nthat's just trying to help you and solve\nyour problems and failing miserably at it!\n\n31\n00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:44.623\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n32\n00:01:44.623 --> 00:01:49.405\nputting your socks in the wrong\ndrawer every single time.\n\n33\n00:01:49.405 --> 00:01:51.787\nAnd you're like no, stop doing that!\n\n34\n00:01:51.787 --> 00:01:55.107\n[BLANK AUDIO]\n&gt;&gt; I've had this happen to me\n\n35\n00:01:55.107 --> 00:01:58.837\njust recently, I was emailing back and\nforth with somebody.\n\n36\n00:01:58.837 --> 00:02:00.407\nI think I talked about\nthis in the other episode.\n\n37\n00:02:00.407 --> 00:02:01.617\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; With James.\n\n38\n00:02:01.617 --> 00:02:03.267\nWe're going back and forth.\n\n39\n00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:06.237\nI send him something and\nthen I didn't hear from him.\n\n40\n00:02:06.237 --> 00:02:07.197\nI'm like, I wonder.\n\n41\n00:02:07.197 --> 00:02:11.027\nI asked him to look at this,\nI'm like, okay, well maybe he's busy.\n\n42\n00:02:11.027 --> 00:02:14.170\nA week goes by, I'm like, seriously?\n\n43\n00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.470\nOf course, I look in my junk mail.\n\n44\n00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.070\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n45\n00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.890\n&gt;&gt; And there's his response.\n\n46\n00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.100\nI'm like, but I was just talking to him.\n\n47\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.000\nWhat's going on here?\n\n48\n00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.793\nSo it's like right in the middle\nwhere he was safe but now he's junk.\n\n49\n00:02:27.793 --> 00:02:30.744\n&gt;&gt; You must have some buzz word in there,\nit was like this is not good,\n\n50\n00:02:30.744 --> 00:02:32.210\nit's going to the junkie pile.\n\n51\n00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.460\n&gt;&gt; Well it's good that you just\nsaid like a buzz word because what\n\n52\n00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.710\nMicrosoft and Outlook and everything is\ndoing is it's trying to be smart for you.\n\n53\n00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.321\nIt's gonna go through and\nlook and scan your emails and\n\n54\n00:02:44.321 --> 00:02:46.316\nsay, that looks like a phishing scam.\n\n55\n00:02:46.316 --> 00:02:49.227\nOr that totally looks like you're\nnot supposed to be getting that.\n\n56\n00:02:49.227 --> 00:02:52.481\nAnd for the most part, honestly,\nit will do a good job,\n\n57\n00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:56.859\nit's just those ones where you have\nto say no, don't treat those as junk.\n\n58\n00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.007\nOr maybe it gets into your inbox and\nyou're like hey wait no,\n\n59\n00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:03.460\nyou need to recognize this as junk,\nand it's like okay.\n\n60\n00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.180\nSo you need to kind of teach it,\n\n61\n00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.600\nyou have to kind of train\nit to know what it's doing.\n\n62\n00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.880\nSo great automatic features and\neverything, but it sometimes needs\n\n63\n00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.525\na little tweaking, and then sometimes\nyou tweak it and it doesn't even work.\n\n64\n00:03:14.525 --> 00:03:17.880\n[LAUGH] And I do wanna clarify now,\nwe'll probably go ahead and talk about it\n\n65\n00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.120\nsomewhere else in here, is that there\nare different levels of junk filtering.\n\n66\n00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.090\nAnd what I mean by you as a client,\nas an end user,\n\n67\n00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.260\nyou do have some things that\nyou can do with adding people\n\n68\n00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.460\nto the safe senders list or putting\npeople on the naughty list or whatever.\n\n69\n00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.952\nBut then there's parts above you,\non your admin level,\n\n70\n00:03:37.952 --> 00:03:41.029\nthings that you might not\neven be able to control.\n\n71\n00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:45.842\nAnd so it's like, hey, I've done\neverything on my end that I could do but\n\n72\n00:03:45.842 --> 00:03:48.885\nI'm still not able to\nhave James get through.\n\n73\n00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:52.608\nSo it might be on a higher level\nthan what you are able to do, so\n\n74\n00:03:52.608 --> 00:03:57.134\nif you're in a large organization you\nmight need to contact your IT people\n\n75\n00:03:57.134 --> 00:04:00.700\nabout some of the things that\nyou need to be able to do.\n\n76\n00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.750\nAnd then maybe even at the admin level,\nI know there's third party apps that kind\n\n77\n00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.020\nof catch things even outside before\nit even gets into your cert.\n\n78\n00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.140\nDo you know what I'm talking about?\n\n79\n00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've worked with those\nin corporate environments.\n\n80\n00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.780\nThey kind of tie-in to the systems\nto be a more robust solution for\n\n81\n00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.800\nweeding out the bad things and\nonly allowing the good things in.\n\n82\n00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.400\nIt is more focused into that area, so\nthey'll make that connection that way.\n\n83\n00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.221\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes, it's even put\nbefore your server or something, so\n\n84\n00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:33.840\nthere's multiple levels.\n\n85\n00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.980\n&gt;&gt; Yea,\nthe one I used was called Web Sense.\n\n86\n00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.305\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It does Internet blocking and\n\n87\n00:04:38.305 --> 00:04:40.180\nemail filtering as well.\n\n88\n00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.670\n&gt;&gt; I know my husband's organization does,\nI don't remember what the name is, but\n\n89\n00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.564\nthere was one incident where he had\nto go to that level to have vendors,\n\n90\n00:04:48.564 --> 00:04:51.884\napproved vendors for\ntheir organization to get past that.\n\n91\n00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:56.746\nSo anyways, we digress but I do want to\ngive you kind of that background knowledge\n\n92\n00:04:56.746 --> 00:05:01.548\nof hey I'll show you these things and\nyou're like didn't work, Vonne I know.\n\n93\n00:05:01.548 --> 00:05:03.216\n&gt;&gt; This is a real crap shoot, right?\n\n94\n00:05:03.216 --> 00:05:04.730\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nit's like what are you talking about?\n\n95\n00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.160\nThat doesn't do anything.\n\n96\n00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.120\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes it does.\n\n97\n00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.950\n&gt;&gt; So there's my disclaimer before\nwe even get down into the computer.\n\n98\n00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.530\n&gt;&gt; Your mileage may vary, right?\n\n99\n00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.163\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, on everything.\n\n100\n00:05:15.163 --> 00:05:19.142\nSo let's come on down, I've got Joey's\ncomputer and I still have my kitty-cat\n\n101\n00:05:19.142 --> 00:05:22.491\nfrom our last episodes and I am not\ngoing to change it cause I like it.\n\n102\n00:05:22.491 --> 00:05:27.473\nAll right, so I do have some websites that\nI wanted to just pull up that I have in\n\n103\n00:05:27.473 --> 00:05:29.478\nshow notes, you can go ahead.\n\n104\n00:05:29.478 --> 00:05:33.810\nAnd it's just an overview of the junk\nmail filter, what it's doing.\n\n105\n00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.560\nI do love that it's a good idea\nto regularly check your email,\n\n106\n00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.200\nI actually put that in all\ncaps in the show notes.\n\n107\n00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.515\nYes, I'm telling you always do this.\n\n108\n00:05:43.515 --> 00:05:45.215\nSo it's nice that it tells you but\n\n109\n00:05:45.215 --> 00:05:49.041\nit's just try giving you like an overview\nof what what is a safe recipient,\n\n110\n00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:52.160\nwhat is a block sender,\ndifferent domains and everything.\n\n111\n00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.485\nSo I just want to kind of point that\nout that there is some good information\n\n112\n00:05:55.485 --> 00:05:58.605\nout there on the Microsoft help sites\nthat will go ahead and do that.\n\n113\n00:05:58.605 --> 00:06:03.400\nAnd then it also talks about the different\njunk mail settings that you have in here.\n\n114\n00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.920\nAgain, more information on what you\nwill be looking in your settings.\n\n115\n00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.170\nSo, let us bring up Joey's back up here.\n\n116\n00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.730\nSo, I do have this.\n\n117\n00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.070\nI do want to show you that I have\na junk folder right in here.\n\n118\n00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.410\nAnd, there we go.\n\n119\n00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.963\nSo, you can see that some of the things,\nlike the Microsoft services team,\n\n120\n00:06:22.963 --> 00:06:24.399\nmy billing statement.\n\n121\n00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:28.844\nHm, I might think that's junk,\nbut it's kind of not.\n\n122\n00:06:28.844 --> 00:06:30.577\nSo it's-\n&gt;&gt; Remember the dead letter office?\n\n123\n00:06:30.577 --> 00:06:34.807\nIt's where mail goes that never gets\nactually delivered or is undeliverable for\n\n124\n00:06:34.807 --> 00:06:35.560\nsome reason?\n\n125\n00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.195\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And they say that\n\n126\n00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:36.710\nyou never find a bill in there.\n\n127\n00:06:37.765 --> 00:06:40.950\n[LAUGH] They always find you.\n\n128\n00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.349\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right?\n\n129\n00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:45.870\nSo this is one of those maybe I\nshouldn't be treating that as junk.\n\n130\n00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:52.313\nOr right in here, obviously me on my\nOffice Pro demo, my Outlook.com account,\n\n131\n00:06:52.313 --> 00:06:57.360\nsomehow in Joey's setting I am\nnot getting through his mail.\n\n132\n00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.170\nI'm not going into the inbox.\n\n133\n00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.470\nYou can see this is a couple\nemails that have gotten through.\n\n134\n00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:07.690\nSo something in Joey's settings is not\nallowing this person to come through.\n\n135\n00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.870\nSo, let's go ahead and\nlook at where those settings are, and\n\n136\n00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.110\nthen where we can kind of tweak it.\n\n137\n00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.200\nAnd I'll tell you probably why, probably-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n138\n00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.340\n&gt;&gt; Why that's happening.\n\n139\n00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.710\nSo, we're gonna come over\nhere to the settings.\n\n140\n00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.800\nAnd we're gonna scroll on down to\nthe bottom and you can see there\n\n141\n00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.420\nare Apps Settings down here what says\nMail and we'll go head and click on that.\n\n142\n00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.000\nThen we jump over to here and\nthen it is in accounts and\n\n143\n00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.250\nyou can see Block or Allow.\n\n144\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.850\nAnd by the way, I just wanna go ahead and\npoint out right now that any settings that\n\n145\n00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:43.860\nyou do on your desktop version of Outlook\nwill go ahead and come through and\n\n146\n00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.192\nsync, if you want to say, in your web app,\nbecause of course, it's the same account.\n\n147\n00:07:48.192 --> 00:07:50.976\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nYou're just either doing it through your\n\n148\n00:07:50.976 --> 00:07:52.772\nlocal or your web version,\n\n149\n00:07:52.772 --> 00:07:56.769\nbut your local version has\na couple different dialog boxes.\n\n150\n00:07:56.769 --> 00:07:59.189\nBut if you add somebody\nto any of these lists.\n\n151\n00:07:59.189 --> 00:08:02.710\nHere it is on the other side other side so\nhere.\n\n152\n00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:03.769\nSo just going through there.\n\n153\n00:08:03.769 --> 00:08:06.405\nSo you can see that I've got\na couple of these things.\n\n154\n00:08:06.405 --> 00:08:11.808\nAnd this is something that I actually did\nin that series that Outlook 2016 series,\n\n155\n00:08:11.808 --> 00:08:14.632\nthat I added Ronnie to\nthe safe senders list.\n\n156\n00:08:14.632 --> 00:08:18.450\nAnd notice that it does have, that it is\nautomatically filtering my junk mail.\n\n157\n00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:23.070\nSo that I guess we should start with\nthe very top is if I found I don't have\n\n158\n00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:27.937\nany emails going to your junk folder,\nyou might wanna turn that on, okay.\n\n159\n00:08:27.937 --> 00:08:30.380\nAnd then down here we\nhave a safe senders list.\n\n160\n00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:36.310\nBasically, anybody that has this email\naddress, always treat them as safe.\n\n161\n00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:37.392\nAnd that's something that you can do.\n\n162\n00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:40.164\nIf somebody keeps getting\nsent into your junk mail,\n\n163\n00:08:40.164 --> 00:08:43.568\nadd them to this particular list and\nyou can go ahead and do that.\n\n164\n00:08:43.568 --> 00:08:45.500\nAnd notice I have some people here.\n\n165\n00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.578\nWe have Chris with his Gmail account.\n\n166\n00:08:48.578 --> 00:08:51.076\nI have Rene and Ronnie from ITProTV.\n\n167\n00:08:51.076 --> 00:08:55.090\nAnd I've noticed right here I have Ronnie,\nRene And Mike.\n\n168\n00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:59.832\nWhat I could do instead of\njust having individual people,\n\n169\n00:08:59.832 --> 00:09:05.846\nyou could just do @ITProTV or\nITProTV.com or wait what, or ITPro.TV.\n\n170\n00:09:05.846 --> 00:09:11.760\nYou add that domain level and then\nanybody with that domain will be sent.\n\n171\n00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:17.140\nSo you don't have to specify individual\npeople, I just did this for fun.\n\n172\n00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.300\nAnd so you can see also, look at this,\ntrust emails from my contacts.\n\n173\n00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:26.594\nThat might be good like if I've added\nthem as my contacts, they're good.\n\n174\n00:09:26.594 --> 00:09:27.940\n&gt;&gt; They're gonna want their stuff.\n\n175\n00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:28.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n176\n00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.420\nSo, you're okay with them.\n\n177\n00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.280\nTreat them as good, all right.\n\n178\n00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.490\nI don't have to add them all to my list,\njust anybody in the contact, let's go out.\n\n179\n00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.210\nI'm gonna scroll out for a little bit.\n\n180\n00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.288\nNow, [LAUGH] Daniel.\n\n181\n00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:44.196\n&gt;&gt; You weren't enjoying my quad\ndaily inspirational platitudes?\n\n182\n00:09:44.196 --> 00:09:46.918\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No.\n\n183\n00:09:46.918 --> 00:09:49.510\n[LAUGH] I don't wanna be inspired.\n\n184\n00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:50.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so.\n\n185\n00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:55.260\n&gt;&gt; So you can see I put you on the naughty\nliest, I put you on a blocked sender.\n\n186\n00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:00.360\nSo that's where hey you are getting a\nbarrage of emails from a specific person,\n\n187\n00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.190\nI need to stop that.\n\n188\n00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:06.160\nPut them on the bad list,\nput them on the blocked senders list.\n\n189\n00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.210\nAnd this is where you physically\ntype in their email addresses and\n\n190\n00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.020\neverything like that.\n\n191\n00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.350\nBut it's gonna be a little bit different\nwhen we go back into the mail and\n\n192\n00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.070\nstart doing like mark as junk,\nmark as not junk.\n\n193\n00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:23.180\nThis is like you're going to the center\nof everything like command central.\n\n194\n00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:29.860\nAnd this is probably why, I'm saying\nprobably, why the vonne_officeprodemoco,\n\n195\n00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.450\nwith the initials right there you can see.\n\n196\n00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:38.350\nDon't trust email unless it comes\nfrom someone in my safe senders and\n\n197\n00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.390\nrecipients list.\n\n198\n00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:44.640\nI wonder if that's, its basically\nsaying if its not anything in here,\n\n199\n00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.530\neverybody else is out.\n\n200\n00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:47.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n201\n00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.330\n&gt;&gt; That might be something you\nmight not wanna turn on, okay.\n\n202\n00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.560\n&gt;&gt; It's a little extreme, right?\n\n203\n00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.390\nCuz like you said,\nunless you're in my safe centers list or\n\n204\n00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.890\nyour recipients list It's\nnot gonna come through.\n\n205\n00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.660\nSo, if you have to work\nwith outside entities,\n\n206\n00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.620\nyou need email to come in from them, maybe\nyou're in sales or something like that.\n\n207\n00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:06.870\nThat's not gonna work for you, right?\n\n208\n00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:07.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; Cuz they won't be able to\n\n209\n00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:08.670\nsend you that stuff.\n\n210\n00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.330\n&gt;&gt; And for\nthese particular demonstrations,\n\n211\n00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.640\nthese are accounts I'm pretty much\nonly emailing between Joe, Lance and\n\n212\n00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.730\nJT,\n&gt;&gt; Right\n\n213\n00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.170\n&gt;&gt; and maybe a few people in\n\n214\n00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:17.800\nthe IT pro tv set.\n\n215\n00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.370\nSo, I'm not even getting outside emails.\n\n216\n00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:20.550\nBut if I was getting a lot more,\n\n217\n00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:25.630\nif this was real account, I'd probably be\ngetting everybody sent to my junk mail.\n\n218\n00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:26.290\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n219\n00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.545\n&gt;&gt; Again, probably.\n\n220\n00:11:27.545 --> 00:11:30.300\n[LAUGH] So\nthat's probably why we've got that.\n\n221\n00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.550\nSo I would advise for right now.\n\n222\n00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.061\nI'm not even gonna advise cuz [LAUGH].\n\n223\n00:11:36.061 --> 00:11:38.835\nI'm just gonna say,\nmake sure you know that that exists.\n\n224\n00:11:38.835 --> 00:11:40.680\n[LAUGH] So we've got that there.\n\n225\n00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.900\nAnd so this is where you can go ahead and\n\n226\n00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:48.610\ncontrol the master list of who gets\nthrough and who doesn't get through.\n\n227\n00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.520\nSo we've got that.\n\n228\n00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.690\nLet's go ahead and leave the options.\n\n229\n00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.640\nI will go ahead and put this over.\n\n230\n00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.650\nSo now back into our inbox.\n\n231\n00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.240\nIf I have somebody that came through.\n\n232\n00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.810\nNow, this is gonna be like a,\n\n233\n00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:06.370\none of those like, it's not a total\nexact example because I have Renee.\n\n234\n00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Remember,\n\n235\n00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:08.690\nRene's on my safe senders list.\n\n236\n00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.356\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, but I don't have many other people\n\n237\n00:12:10.356 --> 00:12:11.802\n[LAUGH] that I have through the email.\n\n238\n00:12:11.802 --> 00:12:16.698\nMaybe I'd rather like, you know what\nRenee, you gotta be treated as junk, okay?\n\n239\n00:12:16.698 --> 00:12:22.240\nSo, if I right-click on my inbox,\nnotice there is an option to mark as junk.\n\n240\n00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.620\nThis is that kind of training\nof your junk filters and\n\n241\n00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.890\nyour outlets to say no let's\ngo ahead put them as junk.\n\n242\n00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:33.610\nAnd then it will remember and then\nhopefully next time that you get another\n\n243\n00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:37.770\nemail from this particular person,\nit'll go ahead and get into junk.\n\n244\n00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.437\nLike I said,\nshe's already in the safe senders though.\n\n245\n00:12:40.437 --> 00:12:43.168\nIt's just like a contradicting myself.\n\n246\n00:12:43.168 --> 00:12:45.369\n&gt;&gt; When you say mark as junk it's\nmarking the person as junk and\n\n247\n00:12:45.369 --> 00:12:47.936\nnot necessarily the content of\nthe email that they're sending you?\n\n248\n00:12:47.936 --> 00:12:48.560\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n249\n00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.685\n&gt;&gt; And that's a very important\ndistinction to make,\n\n250\n00:12:50.685 --> 00:12:53.800\ncuz maybe I just didn't\nlike the email she sent me.\n\n251\n00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.860\nIt's like it's the 12th\ninspirational platitude for the day.\n\n252\n00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:01.110\nThat's the mail I want to go to as junk\nand not necessarily everything from Renee.\n\n253\n00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:05.004\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's actually where\nyou can start getting into rules and\n\n254\n00:13:05.004 --> 00:13:07.120\nwe have a whole other episode on that.\n\n255\n00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.910\nWhere you can say if\nanything in the subject line\n\n256\n00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:13.261\nthat says inspirational platitudes,\nyou're like no,\n\n257\n00:13:13.261 --> 00:13:16.919\nyou're gonna go right into my junk mail or\nto my deleted item.\n\n258\n00:13:16.919 --> 00:13:20.214\nSo that's something to\nwhere it's similar but\n\n259\n00:13:20.214 --> 00:13:23.760\non a different level of-\n&gt;&gt; More your control than it is\n\n260\n00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.150\nthe automated control with Outlook.\n\n261\n00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:29.020\n&gt;&gt; Correct and you're telling it\na rule based on a specific criteria.\n\n262\n00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:33.170\nThe criteria, the subject has these words,\nthat's what we'll get into.\n\n263\n00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:34.972\nBut again, we actually have\nan episode all about that.\n\n264\n00:13:34.972 --> 00:13:35.725\n&gt;&gt; We'll get to that.\n\n265\n00:13:35.725 --> 00:13:37.178\n&gt;&gt; We will get to that.\n\n266\n00:13:37.178 --> 00:13:40.461\nSo you can go ahead and mark that as junk.\n\n267\n00:13:40.461 --> 00:13:43.865\nAnd the same thing would be\nif I'm in my junk folder, so\n\n268\n00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:46.290\nI'll go over to my junk email.\n\n269\n00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.250\nAnd right here if I wanted to say,\nhey, you know what,\n\n270\n00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:52.910\nstop treating the Vonne_OPDC,\nOfficePro.TV.\n\n271\n00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:56.690\nI have to say it in my\nhead every time [LAUGH].\n\n272\n00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:01.794\nSo hey, stop marking this as junk so\nthat you can mark not as junk.\n\n273\n00:14:01.794 --> 00:14:06.490\nSo you have those options right within\nyour messages to go ahead and control.\n\n274\n00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:12.110\nBut again, if it's still not taking go to\nthose settings, that we were just at and\n\n275\n00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:17.261\nstart doing the add to saved senders or\nthe block list and things like that.\n\n276\n00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:22.140\nBecause that's going to take a little\nbit more hold, if you want to say.\n\n277\n00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.920\nSo those are some different\noptions with your junk mail.\n\n278\n00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:31.873\nFor your Outlook.com, I wanted to go ahead\nsince we are doing both paid and free.\n\n279\n00:14:31.873 --> 00:14:34.266\nLet's switch back over to JT.\n\n280\n00:14:34.266 --> 00:14:41.710\nAnd I have the VONOPDC email pulled up\non this particular virtual machine.\n\n281\n00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.101\nSo with this one you don't really have,\nlet's go over to the settings so\n\n282\n00:14:45.101 --> 00:14:45.834\nI can show you.\n\n283\n00:14:45.834 --> 00:14:51.267\nI'll go over to options and we'll scroll\ndown in just a, we're already here.\n\n284\n00:14:51.267 --> 00:14:52.431\nOkay, perfect [LAUGH].\n\n285\n00:14:52.431 --> 00:14:58.510\nSo you can see in the the junk mail, you\ncan see that it's a little bit different.\n\n286\n00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:01.701\nYou have safe senders and\nyou have blocked senders.\n\n287\n00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:05.219\nSo it's kinda showing the options\nin a littler bit different place.\n\n288\n00:15:05.219 --> 00:15:07.897\nIt didn't just say block or\nallow, it says,\n\n289\n00:15:07.897 --> 00:15:12.135\nokay here are you're block senders and\nhere are you're safe senders.\n\n290\n00:15:12.135 --> 00:15:15.499\nAll right, do you want to go ahead and\ndo your filters and reporting.\n\n291\n00:15:15.499 --> 00:15:18.705\nAnd sorry,\non the other side there is an option for\n\n292\n00:15:18.705 --> 00:15:23.893\nwhether you want to report your junk mail,\nto like, to that Microsoft and everything.\n\n293\n00:15:23.893 --> 00:15:25.197\nIt's in a different part of,\n\n294\n00:15:25.197 --> 00:15:27.865\nlike different area in you\nsettings in your create account.\n\n295\n00:15:27.865 --> 00:15:32.825\nBut it's all about how do you want to\nshare report to Microsoft to let them know\n\n296\n00:15:32.825 --> 00:15:34.669\nabout what's going wrong.\n\n297\n00:15:34.669 --> 00:15:38.088\nBecause of course,\nthe more that we contribute to Microsoft,\n\n298\n00:15:38.088 --> 00:15:42.582\nit's juts gonna make there intelligence\nservices, if you wanna say, smarter.\n\n299\n00:15:42.582 --> 00:15:46.501\nSo add to the greater good or\nsomething like that.\n\n300\n00:15:46.501 --> 00:15:50.140\n[LAUGH] So just a little bit different\nsettings on here that you could go ahead\n\n301\n00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.894\nand look for in your outlook.com.\n\n302\n00:15:51.894 --> 00:15:54.004\nSo that's pretty much the same thing.\n\n303\n00:15:54.004 --> 00:15:58.626\nThe only other difference that you have\nin the outlook.com Is like let's say, and\n\n304\n00:15:58.626 --> 00:16:02.671\nit's funny because I was just making\nsure that Joey passed, and he did.\n\n305\n00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:04.643\nHe went ahead and got into the inbox.\n\n306\n00:16:04.643 --> 00:16:10.143\nCuz at one point, there is Joy Fatone\nin the junk mail as well so, you know?\n\n307\n00:16:10.143 --> 00:16:14.875\nBut if you have this up on the top\nmenu bar, you have the junk and\n\n308\n00:16:14.875 --> 00:16:17.670\nthere's, my friend's been hacked.\n\n309\n00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.055\nI thought that was kinda cute.\n\n310\n00:16:19.055 --> 00:16:21.770\n[LAUGH] You don't have\nthat in the paid version.\n\n311\n00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:24.458\nIf I came over here,\nnotice there is that junk of,\n\n312\n00:16:24.458 --> 00:16:27.480\nthis is where we said Mark has junk,\nyou come at the top.\n\n313\n00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.351\nThere's not a,\nmy friend's been hacked option.\n\n314\n00:16:31.351 --> 00:16:35.526\nAnd then just to let you know that on\nthose websites that I have pulled up over\n\n315\n00:16:35.526 --> 00:16:38.707\nthere, in the show notes it\ndoes talk a little bit about,\n\n316\n00:16:38.707 --> 00:16:43.550\nit's just a different feature that they're\ntrying to use on the Outlook.com version\n\n317\n00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:46.970\nof if somebody has been\nhacked on their account.\n\n318\n00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:50.166\nBut on both parts,\nyou also have this phishing scam.\n\n319\n00:16:50.166 --> 00:16:51.923\nAnd this is where, hey,\n\n320\n00:16:51.923 --> 00:16:56.801\nmaybe I need to make sure that I am\nreporting this as a phishing email.\n\n321\n00:16:56.801 --> 00:16:59.910\nAnd that we've talked about\nsome of these things about,\n\n322\n00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:04.100\nit's your bank that says you need\nto go and change your account.\n\n323\n00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.062\n&gt;&gt; Click on this link to log in, right?\n\n324\n00:17:06.062 --> 00:17:09.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's like-\n&gt;&gt; No, don't click on the link.\n\n325\n00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.634\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like Bank of\nAmerica with a k in America.\n\n326\n00:17:12.634 --> 00:17:16.790\n&gt;&gt; Or actually, it could be totally\nlegit looking to be honest with you.\n\n327\n00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:19.550\nIt all comes down to those links\nthat they tell you to click on.\n\n328\n00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.290\nWhat is in that URL?\n\n329\n00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:25.948\nSo, being able to look and see what that\nis, which I do believe you can do inside\n\n330\n00:17:25.948 --> 00:17:29.282\nof Outlook,\nis paramount to avoiding phishing scams.\n\n331\n00:17:29.282 --> 00:17:30.722\nBecause if you click on that link and\n\n332\n00:17:30.722 --> 00:17:33.746\nit takes you to a page that looks just\nlike the sign-in for Bank of America,\n\n333\n00:17:33.746 --> 00:17:36.486\nyou type in your password and\npassword because, my goodness!\n\n334\n00:17:36.486 --> 00:17:37.852\nSomething's wrong with my account!\n\n335\n00:17:37.852 --> 00:17:40.739\nThen it says, we're having\ntrouble logging you in right now,\n\n336\n00:17:40.739 --> 00:17:42.220\nplease try again in a few moments.\n\n337\n00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.943\nAnd then it redirects you to\nthe actual Bank of America account.\n\n338\n00:17:44.943 --> 00:17:46.320\nAnd you log in, everything seems fine.\n\n339\n00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.486\nAnd you're thinking, whew, crisis averted.\n\n340\n00:17:48.486 --> 00:17:51.881\nYou just gave a hacker your username and\npassword to your Bank of America account,\n\n341\n00:17:51.881 --> 00:17:54.008\nand they're gonna log in and\nsteal all your money.\n\n342\n00:17:54.008 --> 00:17:54.732\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and\n\n343\n00:17:54.732 --> 00:17:58.135\nwe have that whole series of end-user\nsecurity that we talk a lot about this.\n\n344\n00:17:58.135 --> 00:18:00.560\nSo, really important stuff to know about.\n\n345\n00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.510\nAnd it's nice that they're\nputting it right into\n\n346\n00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:08.240\ntheir program right here with the web\naccess of, hey, go ahead and report this.\n\n347\n00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.530\nAnd I'll just show you that it's like,\nhey, it's gonna go ahead.\n\n348\n00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:12.385\nWhoops, I just reported.\n\n349\n00:18:12.385 --> 00:18:14.719\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Oops, okay,\n\n350\n00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:18.754\nI thought it was gonna give me a,\nhey, are you sure you wanna do this?\n\n351\n00:18:18.754 --> 00:18:20.691\nThat was what I was supposed to get,\nuh-oh.\n\n352\n00:18:20.691 --> 00:18:22.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n353\n00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:26.339\nmaybe I should go make sure that\nJoey's [LAUGH] account still works.\n\n354\n00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:30.342\nAll right, anyways, but you could see\nthat it does talk about the phshing and\n\n355\n00:18:30.342 --> 00:18:31.519\nare you reporting it.\n\n356\n00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:32.748\nI was hoping I would get that.\n\n357\n00:18:32.748 --> 00:18:33.610\nSo guess what?\n\n358\n00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:39.424\nIn outlook.com, [LAUGH] we just learned\nyou don't get an option of, are you sure?\n\n359\n00:18:39.424 --> 00:18:40.838\n&gt;&gt; Just reporting.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I guess what?\n\n360\n00:18:40.838 --> 00:18:43.752\nI just did that to myself so-\n&gt;&gt; Good job, Vonne.\n\n361\n00:18:43.752 --> 00:18:46.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Don's gonna be like,\nwhat's going on with this account?\n\n362\n00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:47.440\nSorry.\n\n363\n00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.248\n&gt;&gt; I've been flagged as a spammer and\na phisher.\n\n364\n00:18:49.248 --> 00:18:53.951\n&gt;&gt; It was for the teaching part.\n\n365\n00:18:53.951 --> 00:18:56.145\nI taught myself right out of my account.\n\n366\n00:18:56.145 --> 00:18:59.241\nAll right, so I just wanted to\ngo ahead and show you that.\n\n367\n00:18:59.241 --> 00:19:03.730\nAnd then overall, that's pretty\nmuch what we have about junk mail.\n\n368\n00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.381\nShowed you the settings, what we can do.\n\n369\n00:19:05.381 --> 00:19:07.980\nSometimes you can't control\nit as much as you want to.\n\n370\n00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.661\nCuz we talked about that admin level and\nclient level and\n\n371\n00:19:10.661 --> 00:19:13.242\nsome of those other filters\nthat it might go through.\n\n372\n00:19:13.242 --> 00:19:17.996\nBut at least you know where there's parts\nthat you can hopefully try to control.\n\n373\n00:19:17.996 --> 00:19:23.324\nAnd just be all and end all,\nalways check your junk mail folder.\n\n374\n00:19:23.324 --> 00:19:28.310\nCheck it every day and make sure\nthat you're not missing something.\n\n375\n00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:29.872\nSo that's my final thought.\n\n376\n00:19:29.872 --> 00:19:32.754\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Vonne, it looks like\nwe've wrapped up yet another episode.\n\n377\n00:19:32.754 --> 00:19:33.663\nWe do thank you for\n\n378\n00:19:33.663 --> 00:19:37.367\nteaching us about how we can use our\njunk mail feature inside of Outlook.\n\n379\n00:19:37.367 --> 00:19:40.910\nVery important thing is, even though it\ncan be a little frustrating at times.\n\n380\n00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.118\nSo make sure that you're familiar\nwith all those settings and\n\n381\n00:19:43.118 --> 00:19:45.090\ncan work with them inside\nyour environments.\n\n382\n00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.530\nBut it does, like I said, looks like\nwe're at the end of this episode.\n\n383\n00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:49.100\nWe do thank you for watching as well.\n\n384\n00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.843\nSigning off for Office ProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n385\n00:19:51.843 --> 00:19:52.680\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n386\n00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.281\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n387\n00:19:55.281 --> 00:20:00.150\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another great\nepisode of OFFICEPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.154 --> 00:00:18.832\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n5\n00:00:18.832 --> 00:00:22.757\nit's a days episode we're back with\nmore in our Outlook on the web series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:27.488\nAnd joining us yet again, lending her\nlovely self to us and her immense and\n\n7\n00:00:27.488 --> 00:00:30.782\nmassive amount of knowledge\nabout Outlook [LAUGH].\n\n8\n00:00:30.782 --> 00:00:33.038\nThat's gonna come in handy in this series,\nthat's for sure.\n\n9\n00:00:33.038 --> 00:00:34.275\nOur good friend, Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:35.555\nVonne, welcome back, how's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:37.227\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, how are you?\n\n12\n00:00:37.227 --> 00:00:38.643\n&gt;&gt; I can complain, thank you.\n\n13\n00:00:38.643 --> 00:00:41.699\n&gt;&gt; Good, I realize I don't\nusually ask you how you're doing.\n\n14\n00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.087\n&gt;&gt; Horrible.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, I'm sorry,\n\n15\n00:00:43.087 --> 00:00:44.603\nyou're going to have to keep going, so.\n\n16\n00:00:44.603 --> 00:00:46.267\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Suck it up, buddy!\n\n17\n00:00:46.267 --> 00:00:48.650\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly [LAUGHS] Well,\n\n18\n00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.461\nwe're going to be talking about rules and\nautomation.\n\n19\n00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:53.245\nI almost said animation.\n\n20\n00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:54.884\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHTER]\n&gt;&gt; Wonder why?\n\n21\n00:00:54.884 --> 00:00:58.179\n&gt;&gt; I know, so\nwe have rules and automation.\n\n22\n00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:02.816\nAnd we're going to well,\nmake some rules and automate some stuff.\n\n23\n00:01:02.816 --> 00:01:07.144\n[LAUGH] We actually kind of\nalluded to rules when we were\n\n24\n00:01:07.144 --> 00:01:09.269\ntalking about junk mail.\n\n25\n00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:13.788\nAbout well, when we write a rule\nwe basically have a criteria and\n\n26\n00:01:13.788 --> 00:01:16.392\nthen this is going to have an action.\n\n27\n00:01:16.392 --> 00:01:18.328\nSo it’s like an if then statement.\n\n28\n00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:22.848\nIf I receive an email from say Justin,\n\n29\n00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:27.944\nI want to then move it\nto a specific folder.\n\n30\n00:01:27.944 --> 00:01:31.021\nOkay because we did this in\nthe organization organize,\n\n31\n00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:33.451\ncustomize and search my, that episode.\n\n32\n00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:35.535\nTo where we started making\nindividual folders.\n\n33\n00:01:35.535 --> 00:01:38.279\nWell, you could go ahead and\nwrite a rule that just says,\n\n34\n00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:40.506\nhey, move that right into that folder.\n\n35\n00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:44.925\nSweet, so that way, I could go ahead and\nkeep organizing myself even more and\n\n36\n00:01:44.925 --> 00:01:46.904\njust have it do it automatically.\n\n37\n00:01:46.904 --> 00:01:47.979\nSo that's what we've got.\n\n38\n00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.371\nAnd I think we talked\nabout the platitudes,\n\n39\n00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:50.923\nour inspirational platitudes\nin our junk mail.\n\n40\n00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:54.198\n&gt;&gt; Yes, God love them [LAUGH].\n\n41\n00:01:54.198 --> 00:01:55.373\nThey are fun.\n\n42\n00:01:55.373 --> 00:01:58.230\n&gt;&gt; But when it's like I\ndon't want any more, so hey.\n\n43\n00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.874\nIf you see an email that says\ninspirational platitudes then throw it in\n\n44\n00:02:02.874 --> 00:02:03.669\nthe trash.\n\n45\n00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:05.437\nThose type of things.\n\n46\n00:02:05.437 --> 00:02:09.229\nSo we're gonna go through some of those\ndifferent settings, how to create rules,\n\n47\n00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.432\nand see what's going on.\n\n48\n00:02:10.432 --> 00:02:16.491\nI've got Joey's account, and we're also\ngonna be jumping around accounts today,\n\n49\n00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:19.603\nso we're gonna hang out with Lance and\nJT and\n\n50\n00:02:19.603 --> 00:02:23.158\nJoe with the whole crew\nwell minus Chris and JC.\n\n51\n00:02:23.158 --> 00:02:24.961\nMy gosh I almost forgot.\n\n52\n00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:26.129\nI can't remember.\n\n53\n00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.363\nOkay anyway so\ndown here we've got some things going on.\n\n54\n00:02:31.363 --> 00:02:34.608\nNow I do wanna show you\nthat there are some\n\n55\n00:02:34.608 --> 00:02:38.534\nrules that are already\ncreated in Joys account.\n\n56\n00:02:38.534 --> 00:02:42.992\nSo let's go ahead and\nlook at where they are in our web version\n\n57\n00:02:42.992 --> 00:02:47.365\nbecause if you have rules\ncreated in your desktop version,\n\n58\n00:02:47.365 --> 00:02:51.747\nthey will most of the time\ntranslate over into your web app.\n\n59\n00:02:51.747 --> 00:02:54.357\nWe keep talking about that\nit's the same account.\n\n60\n00:02:54.357 --> 00:02:55.822\nSo it's just different\nways of getting there.\n\n61\n00:02:55.822 --> 00:03:00.179\nBut where we get to our rules here as\nwe go ahead and go to our settings.\n\n62\n00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:02.024\nAnd down towards the very bottom,\n\n63\n00:03:02.024 --> 00:03:05.086\nat the we have our app settings\nwe've got mail down here.\n\n64\n00:03:05.086 --> 00:03:09.715\nYou guys have been seeing me do this\na lot so, we come over here, and\n\n65\n00:03:09.715 --> 00:03:15.092\nthen the automatic processing it's over\non the left side we go to the inbox and\n\n66\n00:03:15.092 --> 00:03:16.110\nsweep rules.\n\n67\n00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.874\nWe will be addressing what sweep means\nin this episode, but for right now,\n\n68\n00:03:19.874 --> 00:03:23.008\njust say okay, let's I don't\nfeel like sweeping right now.\n\n69\n00:03:23.008 --> 00:03:23.758\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n70\n00:03:23.758 --> 00:03:25.685\n&gt;&gt; We have our inbox rules, and\n\n71\n00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:30.503\nyou can see that we have a rule that\nsays Justin Timberlake band label and\n\n72\n00:03:30.503 --> 00:03:33.499\nwe also have move\nmessages from Lance Bass.\n\n73\n00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:36.782\nI’m just gonna scroll over a little bit so\nyou can just see.\n\n74\n00:03:36.782 --> 00:03:39.637\nThe difference right here, gosh,\nyou’ve got to really scroll on over.\n\n75\n00:03:39.637 --> 00:03:44.218\nThis particular one, I just wanted to\npoint out, it says the rules you have\n\n76\n00:03:44.218 --> 00:03:48.876\nselected cannot be viewed because this\nis created in a desktop version, but\n\n77\n00:03:48.876 --> 00:03:52.039\nyou're like well,\ndoes that mean I can't use it?\n\n78\n00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:57.044\nNo, it's still there, but\nif the way that the rule is written,\n\n79\n00:03:57.044 --> 00:04:03.084\nis that it's not an option that you\nhave necessarily within the web version.\n\n80\n00:04:03.084 --> 00:04:09.054\nIf it was written in that space,\nyou need to go to that space to edit it.\n\n81\n00:04:09.054 --> 00:04:14.750\nThat's talking about why you can't\ncome in and edit this particular rule.\n\n82\n00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.695\nIt's still on.\n\n83\n00:04:16.695 --> 00:04:20.006\nWhat will happen cuz remember it's gonna\nbe doing it on the desktop version anyway\n\n84\n00:04:20.006 --> 00:04:21.497\nso it's gonna apply right here too.\n\n85\n00:04:21.497 --> 00:04:26.333\nAll good, so this is the one where you\ncan see it move messages from Lance Bass,\n\n86\n00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:28.622\nthis one it looks a little different.\n\n87\n00:04:28.622 --> 00:04:32.659\nLet's look, move messages from Lance Bass,\nafter the message arrives and\n\n88\n00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:37.281\nthe message was received from Lance Bass,\nbecause there's different criteria's.\n\n89\n00:04:37.281 --> 00:04:38.207\nDo the following.\n\n90\n00:04:38.207 --> 00:04:42.563\nJust move it into the Lance folder,\nand then don't do anything else.\n\n91\n00:04:42.563 --> 00:04:47.116\nStop after this, and just not keep on\ngoing, because that's what we got.\n\n92\n00:04:47.116 --> 00:04:48.664\nAnd this rule is on.\n\n93\n00:04:48.664 --> 00:04:50.703\nCool, all right well, there you go.\n\n94\n00:04:50.703 --> 00:04:54.345\nAnd notice that we have some\ndifferent Icons up here at the top,\n\n95\n00:04:54.345 --> 00:04:58.073\nthat we can add a new row which\nwill go through that dialogue box.\n\n96\n00:04:58.073 --> 00:05:01.166\nYou can see the steps, and\nwe can edit the rule, so\n\n97\n00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:05.445\nthat if maybe I wanted to add another\ncriteria on this existing rule,\n\n98\n00:05:05.445 --> 00:05:08.639\nI could trash it, and\nthen I can move it up and down.\n\n99\n00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.363\nNow why would you wanna move it up and\ndown because it will, if you have rules\n\n100\n00:05:13.363 --> 00:05:18.100\nthat kind of follow each other,\nI need to have this done first, then this.\n\n101\n00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.151\nThere is a pecking order if you wanna say,\nthe sequence and\n\n102\n00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:27.860\nhow you stack this does make a difference\nif your rules kind of play off each other,\n\n103\n00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.699\nfor lack of a better term.\n\n104\n00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.620\nAnd then if you don't wanna just like,\nyou don't wanna delete it,\n\n105\n00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.658\nyou just wanna turn it off,\nthen you just uncheck the boxes over here.\n\n106\n00:05:35.658 --> 00:05:39.719\nBut notice that this one on the Justin\nTimberlake band label, I can't edit, and\n\n107\n00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:43.377\nthat was that whole thing because it\nwas created in the desktop version.\n\n108\n00:05:43.377 --> 00:05:47.788\nAll right, let's scroll on out, and\njust to see, well, you know what?\n\n109\n00:05:47.788 --> 00:05:48.625\nLet me pause.\n\n110\n00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:52.114\nI was gonna say, let's see this in action,\nI'll switch over to Lance and\n\n111\n00:05:52.114 --> 00:05:54.442\nactually write an email\nto Joey to see it happen.\n\n112\n00:05:54.442 --> 00:05:57.666\nBut let's just stay in here for\na little bit longer and\n\n113\n00:05:57.666 --> 00:06:01.622\nthen we'll see it because what if\nI wanted to write another rule?\n\n114\n00:06:01.622 --> 00:06:04.604\nWe talked about that\ninspirational platitudes,\n\n115\n00:06:04.604 --> 00:06:07.232\nright let's see if we\ncould write that out.\n\n116\n00:06:07.232 --> 00:06:12.581\nSo you click on the plus sign and\nyou basically just follow the steps.\n\n117\n00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:17.002\nWhat I wanna name this, and we'll just say\ntest because I'm not necessarily sure it's\n\n118\n00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:18.629\ngoing to really mean anything.\n\n119\n00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:20.658\nI only have so many senders really.\n\n120\n00:06:20.658 --> 00:06:25.612\nSo when the message arrives and\nit matches all of these conditions, and\n\n121\n00:06:25.612 --> 00:06:28.265\nlook at what we have all through here.\n\n122\n00:06:28.265 --> 00:06:31.138\nIt was sent from somebody.\n\n123\n00:06:31.138 --> 00:06:36.070\nIt was sent to me, that kinda stuff.\n\n124\n00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.016\nMaybe only me and not other people.\n\n125\n00:06:39.016 --> 00:06:43.205\nSo, you have those kinds of\ndifferent options that you can do.\n\n126\n00:06:43.205 --> 00:06:44.665\nIt includes this words.\n\n127\n00:06:44.665 --> 00:06:50.243\nThat’s what we're talking about like if\nit's in the subject line I wanted to say,\n\n128\n00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:53.276\nno I have to spell\ninspirational platitudes.\n\n129\n00:06:53.276 --> 00:06:53.819\n&gt;&gt; In spirit.\n\n130\n00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:59.403\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] In spirit-\n&gt;&gt; Pirational.\n\n131\n00:06:59.403 --> 00:06:59.998\n&gt;&gt; Inspir.\n\n132\n00:06:59.998 --> 00:07:04.491\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; S-P-I-R-I-T.\n\n133\n00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:08.019\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Daniel, [LAUGH] there we go.\n\n134\n00:07:08.019 --> 00:07:09.891\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not the greatest spellers, are we?\n\n135\n00:07:09.891 --> 00:07:10.654\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n136\n00:07:10.654 --> 00:07:13.985\nI am a horrible speller I will\njust tell you that right now.\n\n137\n00:07:13.985 --> 00:07:17.535\nSo we're gonna say,\ndoes it actually have Daniel in the title,\n\n138\n00:07:17.535 --> 00:07:19.588\nokay cuz I can spell your name [LAUGH].\n\n139\n00:07:19.588 --> 00:07:24.066\nWe click okay, so\nthere is my one condition.\n\n140\n00:07:24.066 --> 00:07:26.147\nIt has it in the subject.\n\n141\n00:07:26.147 --> 00:07:28.838\nNow, that could just be\nyour only condition.\n\n142\n00:07:28.838 --> 00:07:30.283\nYou don't have to have multiples.\n\n143\n00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:34.439\nBut if you wanted to,\nI could have another condition.\n\n144\n00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:39.055\nIf I add another condition, maybe it has\nto have the subject line that has to\n\n145\n00:07:39.055 --> 00:07:41.562\nhave something, a word that is Daniel.\n\n146\n00:07:41.562 --> 00:07:46.236\nAnd it has to be sent from,\nor received from,\n\n147\n00:07:46.236 --> 00:07:49.934\nand then we'll say Fuego, right?\n\n148\n00:07:49.934 --> 00:07:53.245\nOkay so if Fuego,\nthere's no email address, okay sorry.\n\n149\n00:07:53.245 --> 00:07:55.225\nOkay we'll go with Chris [LAUGH].\n\n150\n00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:58.494\nWe'll go with Chris, and\nthen we'll say okay so\n\n151\n00:07:58.494 --> 00:08:03.675\nif Chris is sending me a message, and it\nhas a subject line in there of Daniel or\n\n152\n00:08:03.675 --> 00:08:06.623\nany word,\nit just has to have that one word,\n\n153\n00:08:06.623 --> 00:08:11.931\nit can be there's other words in there\nThat would be that it will do something.\n\n154\n00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:13.990\nWe will move it.\n\n155\n00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.460\nYou see we can pin the message,\nwe can forward it to it.\n\n156\n00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:21.070\nCuz maybe if Chris is\nemailing me about Daniel.\n\n157\n00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.780\nYou know what?\n\n158\n00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.540\nI don't have any control over Daniel.\n\n159\n00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.092\nI'm gonna send that right over to Don.\n\n160\n00:08:25.092 --> 00:08:28.340\n[LAUGH] Those types of things,\nyou can have those rules.\n\n161\n00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:33.010\nOr maybe I want to move\nthis to delete the message.\n\n162\n00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.131\nI just don't want to hear\nanything about Daniel from Chris.\n\n163\n00:08:36.131 --> 00:08:37.870\nSo, we have those different.\n\n164\n00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.300\nYou like haha, sure right.\n\n165\n00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.530\nSo I can have all these different\nactions that I can take.\n\n166\n00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.490\nBut, there are also exceptions.\n\n167\n00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:51.720\nOkay, except if there's something\nthat its a marked with an importance.\n\n168\n00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.240\nOkay?\nAnd you can see there's\n\n169\n00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.710\nmany different combinations of these\ndifferent things that you can add.\n\n170\n00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.490\n&gt;&gt; And were going through\nin each one today [LAUGH].\n\n171\n00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.129\n&gt;&gt; Yeah right, every single one.\n\n172\n00:09:01.129 --> 00:09:03.730\nSo you would be here for a long time.\n\n173\n00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.910\n&gt;&gt; Part 17 of our show\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] Then you'll want it\n\n174\n00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:07.780\nto be the leading me.\n\n175\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:08.310\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n176\n00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.455\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So you can see that I can\nmake an exception to this rule or\n\n177\n00:09:12.455 --> 00:09:16.160\nthis condition and\nthen it will go ahead and go path.\n\n178\n00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.820\nAnd then of course,\nthought processing more rules.\n\n179\n00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:24.520\nWhat that means is that okay, then after\nthis, just don't move on in a sense.\n\n180\n00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.960\nI don't want you to do anything else and\nif there's any other rules that kind of\n\n181\n00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.430\nhad happened before then everybody\nup to this point now to stop\n\n182\n00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:33.560\n&gt;&gt; It seems like again,\n\n183\n00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.910\nI always come back to this\nprogrammatic thing of how we program,\n\n184\n00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:43.040\nwhen you're programming things to do\nstuff you're saying if this then do this.\n\n185\n00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.860\nIf that then do this is this is basic\nconditional statement that we're creating\n\n186\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.460\nit's just a nice wizard that walks us\nthrough we don't have to code this in.\n\n187\n00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.160\nAnd usually at the end\nof statements like that,\n\n188\n00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.380\nthere's some sort of way to get out of it,\nsay, okay, I'm done processing that.\n\n189\n00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.480\nThat's what we're seeing here.\n\n190\n00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; With this,\n\n191\n00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.030\nokay, we're done with that statement.\n\n192\n00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.320\nYou can move on to something else.\n\n193\n00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're talking about with\nloops and everything like that, so\n\n194\n00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.840\nthat's exactly what we have here.\n\n195\n00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.320\nAnd so that's how you can create a rule,\nand I'm gonna click OK.\n\n196\n00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.900\nAnd, I have a few errors, good,\nlet me tell you, what is it?\n\n197\n00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.200\nThe exception, so I added an exception,\nbut I didn't choose-\n\n198\n00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.707\n&gt;&gt; But there was no exception there.\n\n199\n00:10:19.707 --> 00:10:21.150\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so the nice thing is,\n\n200\n00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.940\nwell, there is no exception, okay?\n\n201\n00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.930\nI just put the little x right here to say,\nno, I didn't want to add an exception.\n\n202\n00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.200\nSo it's nice that it's checking, we've\ngot a little error checking In our basic\n\n203\n00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:38.380\nwriting a program right now so we click\nok and then now I have an inbox rule\n\n204\n00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:44.294\nthat says that if Chris emails me anything\nabout Daniel I'm putting it in the trash.\n\n205\n00:10:44.294 --> 00:10:46.140\n[LAUGH] No more of you.\n\n206\n00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:51.200\nSo that's what we've got going on with Our\nrules, which can be really, really handy.\n\n207\n00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.756\nSo just to see this in action like I said,\nlet's come over here to our,\n\n208\n00:10:55.756 --> 00:11:00.070\nwhoops, I just collapsed my Favorite,\nwe're in our Inbox.\n\n209\n00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.555\nAll right,\nlet's switch over here to Lance.\n\n210\n00:11:02.555 --> 00:11:08.580\nWe will create a new message and\njust say, a BTW here with Lance.\n\n211\n00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:13.091\nI've been using Firefox for Lance, cuz\nI've been using Lance kinda like my test\n\n212\n00:11:13.091 --> 00:11:16.288\nground to get everything or\nanything like that.\n\n213\n00:11:16.288 --> 00:11:19.378\nIt is so fast with Firefox,it's so\n\n214\n00:11:19.378 --> 00:11:23.910\nmuch faster than Edge,\n[LAUGH] so it's kind of like,\n\n215\n00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:29.010\nI'm kind of liking Firefox in this-\n&gt;&gt; Started to win you over all right.\n\n216\n00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.660\n&gt;&gt; It is, yeah, I just like and\n\n217\n00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.760\nwhen we had this discussion I mean I\nhaven't been using Firefox for some time.\n\n218\n00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.540\nNot for any reason, just because.\n\n219\n00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:36.420\n&gt;&gt; Just because it happened that way.\n\n220\n00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.720\n&gt;&gt; Man it was fast with this stuff so\nI was pretty happy about that.\n\n221\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.290\nSo we're going to email Joey and\nwe're going to say hello and\n\n222\n00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.470\nwe'll just say hi, nothing too big.\n\n223\n00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.150\nWe're gonna go ahead and send it on.\n\n224\n00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:55.800\nFrom Lance's account we'll jump on over\nselect will jump on over to Joey and\n\n225\n00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:00.720\nif I'm looking in my inbox and,\nwhere did it go?\n\n226\n00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.425\nWell, it's right there.\n\n227\n00:12:02.425 --> 00:12:07.640\nCuz my rule was when I get an email from\nLance, go ahead and put it directly into\n\n228\n00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.680\nLance's folder, and that's where I\nhave my hello message from Lance.\n\n229\n00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.580\nSo these rules work.\n\n230\n00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:17.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of my favorite things to\ndo with these folder re-directions,\n\n231\n00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.560\nwhen you get an email from Lance,\nsend it to the Lance folder.\n\n232\n00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.050\nWhen I first started doing this,\n\n233\n00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:26.590\njust a little real world scenario here\nsince it wasn't going to my inbox\n\n234\n00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.540\nI wasn't getting an audible\nnotification that I got a new email.\n\n235\n00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:35.590\nSo I was missing a lot of incoming email\nbecause it was redirecting to the folder.\n\n236\n00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.725\nYou can add that function\nin to your rules and\n\n237\n00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:42.485\nI suggest doing it so\nthat you don't miss the audible tone.\n\n238\n00:12:42.485 --> 00:12:44.655\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think if I'm not mistaking,\n\n239\n00:12:44.655 --> 00:12:46.595\nI think you can do that\nin the desktop version.\n\n240\n00:12:46.595 --> 00:12:47.125\n&gt;&gt; At the bottom of that.\n\n241\n00:12:47.125 --> 00:12:48.245\n&gt;&gt; You know what, let's go look at it.\n\n242\n00:12:48.245 --> 00:12:49.395\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Let's go look right now.\n\n243\n00:12:49.395 --> 00:12:52.297\nBecause I'm thinking, I'm like,\nI don't I do not remember seeing,\n\n244\n00:12:52.297 --> 00:12:53.737\nadd a sound, to that.\n\n245\n00:12:53.737 --> 00:12:54.402\n&gt;&gt; Add a sound?\n\n246\n00:12:54.402 --> 00:12:57.907\n&gt;&gt; But\nthat is a really good point right there.\n\n247\n00:12:57.907 --> 00:12:59.761\nBecause I was like, \" yea\".\n\n248\n00:12:59.761 --> 00:13:00.497\nBecause I was thinking the same thing.\n\n249\n00:13:00.497 --> 00:13:01.376\n&gt;&gt; Or give you the little pop-up.\n\n250\n00:13:01.376 --> 00:13:04.992\nThe little pop-up box wasn't\nshowing up either to say,\n\n251\n00:13:04.992 --> 00:13:07.488\nyou have a new email from such and such.\n\n252\n00:13:07.488 --> 00:13:09.127\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n253\n00:13:09.127 --> 00:13:09.847\n&gt;&gt; I needed all of those.\n\n254\n00:13:09.847 --> 00:13:11.110\nI was so used to it.\n\n255\n00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.880\nIt's like a clutch for me, and\nif it wasn't there I couldn't work.\n\n256\n00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.880\n&gt;&gt; That's a really good point, let's do.\n\n257\n00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.780\nOkay so do the phone,\nyou have move a message.\n\n258\n00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:25.052\nAnd then do we have, okay so right\nhere we don't have like play a sound,\n\n259\n00:13:25.052 --> 00:13:29.667\nwhich is interesting, but\nI do know like down here.\n\n260\n00:13:29.667 --> 00:13:32.333\nI'm just jump on to the what is this,\n\n261\n00:13:32.333 --> 00:13:37.321\nthe local version right here because\nwe do have our managing rules and\n\n262\n00:13:37.321 --> 00:13:42.395\nyou can see right there if I go into\nediting this one, we could go into,\n\n263\n00:13:42.395 --> 00:13:47.727\nall right let's go ahead I think just\nclicked let's come back over here,\n\n264\n00:13:47.727 --> 00:13:53.170\ntry it again, we'll come back into here\nand we will go and double click it.\n\n265\n00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:57.059\nThat's what I was forgetting and so\nyou can see there is the we're gonna set\n\n266\n00:13:57.059 --> 00:14:01.195\nthe condition we've all ready got that so\nlet's go to the next what is the action\n\n267\n00:14:01.195 --> 00:14:04.739\nwe have it to move and then there\nis right there, see, play a sound.\n\n268\n00:14:04.739 --> 00:14:05.874\n&gt;&gt; And then you choose the sound you want.\n\n269\n00:14:05.874 --> 00:14:06.444\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n270\n00:14:06.444 --> 00:14:10.544\nSo maybe if I do have access to\na desktop version I could do that.\n\n271\n00:14:10.544 --> 00:14:15.492\n&gt;&gt; With Office 365 I can't remember\ndo you get at least one installation\n\n272\n00:14:15.492 --> 00:14:17.690\nof a local client with a 365?\n\n273\n00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.945\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n\n274\n00:14:18.945 --> 00:14:21.960\nIf you have an Office 365 account.\n\n275\n00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.900\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; You have the option to install\n\n276\n00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:30.080\nlocal versions, or locally installed\nversions of all of your products.\n\n277\n00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.782\n&gt;&gt; RIght.\n&gt;&gt; It is one of those things where,\n\n278\n00:14:31.782 --> 00:14:35.732\nI guess it really depends, and that's\nwhere I was like, well, if we can do\n\n279\n00:14:35.732 --> 00:14:40.161\nthe web app, we can also have a local, but\nthen some people only work in the web app.\n\n280\n00:14:40.161 --> 00:14:40.727\n&gt;&gt; It's true, they do, they do.\n\n281\n00:14:40.727 --> 00:14:43.035\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's why we have this whole series.\n\n282\n00:14:43.035 --> 00:14:43.544\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n283\n00:14:43.544 --> 00:14:45.454\n&gt;&gt; But yes, you are correct in that sense.\n\n284\n00:14:45.454 --> 00:14:47.322\n&gt;&gt; There are some limitations to the web\n\n285\n00:14:47.322 --> 00:14:50.818\napp versus the locally installed client,\nbecause, as you can see,\n\n286\n00:14:50.818 --> 00:14:54.506\nit is extremely feature full when it\ncomes to locally installed client.\n\n287\n00:14:54.506 --> 00:14:56.348\nSo ,maybe just install it for\n\n288\n00:14:56.348 --> 00:14:59.294\nthings of this nature,\nand then I don't know,\n\n289\n00:14:59.294 --> 00:15:03.845\nwill that transfer over to the Office 365?\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's see, cuz I mean,\n\n290\n00:15:03.845 --> 00:15:07.994\nI'm doing it right here where I'm adding\nI play the sound to this and I go ahead.\n\n291\n00:15:07.994 --> 00:15:08.824\nYou can't save your rule\n\n292\n00:15:08.824 --> 00:15:10.090\nbecause a value is missing.\n\n293\n00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.661\nOkay let's set the under cuz it sounds.\n\n294\n00:15:12.661 --> 00:15:18.012\nOkay we'll go ahead and\nadd chose okay now this is where since\n\n295\n00:15:18.012 --> 00:15:23.172\nit's pulling from our media I'm\nwondering if that's where it\n\n296\n00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:27.932\nmight not pull it, I'm not, necessarily-\n&gt;&gt; Is there anything in the music,you can\n\n297\n00:15:27.932 --> 00:15:28.567\ngrab it from anywhere.\n\n298\n00:15:28.567 --> 00:15:31.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is true,I don't know\nif I have any music on here so,-\n\n299\n00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.030\n&gt;&gt; There's usually a default MP3 in there.\n\n300\n00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.699\n&gt;&gt; I thought so yeah,\n&gt;&gt; Grab the music, click to your left,\n\n301\n00:15:35.699 --> 00:15:37.586\nyeah, there you there,\nthere is your alarms.\n\n302\n00:15:37.586 --> 00:15:41.192\n&gt;&gt; There it is, okay perfect we'll\ngo with alarm [INAUDIBLE] thank you,\n\n303\n00:15:41.192 --> 00:15:41.750\n[ [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n304\n00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:42.485\n&gt;&gt; So we click and\n\n305\n00:15:42.485 --> 00:15:45.060\nthat should go ahead and\nthere's no exceptions,\n\n306\n00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:49.106\nokay we're doing that,we'll go ahead and\nfinish this rule will run, okay,\n\n307\n00:15:49.106 --> 00:15:52.538\nif it isn't, that's just making\nsure that if it's not running,\n\n308\n00:15:52.538 --> 00:15:56.064\nyou have to make sure that you're\nonline and everything like that.\n\n309\n00:15:56.064 --> 00:16:00.437\nSo, we'll click okay and okay?\n\n310\n00:16:00.437 --> 00:16:00.988\nThere's a rule.\n\n311\n00:16:00.988 --> 00:16:04.335\nHas a condition that\nthe server cannot process.\n\n312\n00:16:04.335 --> 00:16:05.595\nRemains server rule.\n\n313\n00:16:05.595 --> 00:16:09.233\nOkay, it's just basically telling me that\nthis you have that stop are you sure you\n\n314\n00:16:09.233 --> 00:16:09.926\nwanna do this?\n\n315\n00:16:09.926 --> 00:16:11.621\nThat was just a warning, that's okay.\n\n316\n00:16:11.621 --> 00:16:13.353\nSo we're good there.\n\n317\n00:16:13.353 --> 00:16:18.255\nNow, if I come back over to here,\nand we're gonna cancel this, and\n\n318\n00:16:18.255 --> 00:16:20.848\nthen we'll come back over to here.\n\n319\n00:16:20.848 --> 00:16:25.007\nLet’s just do a refresh it's always good\nto do a refresh to make sure like you've\n\n320\n00:16:25.007 --> 00:16:25.933\ngot everything.\n\n321\n00:16:25.933 --> 00:16:29.075\n&gt;&gt; It's pulling the most current\ninformation that it can, right?\n\n322\n00:16:29.075 --> 00:16:33.136\n&gt;&gt; Correct, so let's look at this and see,\nI'm sure the options are gonna be there.\n\n323\n00:16:33.136 --> 00:16:35.470\nI'm just wondering if\nit's not gonna do it.\n\n324\n00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:36.692\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm wondering.\n\n325\n00:16:36.692 --> 00:16:40.118\n&gt;&gt; So I'm sure that's gonna show you\nthat they have a sound in there.\n\n326\n00:16:40.118 --> 00:16:40.851\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n327\n00:16:40.851 --> 00:16:45.125\n&gt;&gt; But, if you're actually going\nto hear it in your web app.\n\n328\n00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:45.756\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n329\n00:16:45.756 --> 00:16:47.891\n&gt;&gt; That’s-\n&gt;&gt; You do have your sound turned up right?\n\n330\n00:16:47.891 --> 00:16:49.333\n&gt;&gt; I do, we have that.\n\n331\n00:16:49.333 --> 00:16:52.297\nSo why don't we just double check.\n\n332\n00:16:52.297 --> 00:16:58.294\nWe’ll go into mail, I'm already there and\nthen we go here and then we have this one.\n\n333\n00:16:58.294 --> 00:17:01.383\nWell you know what this is,\nthis is a fun little sideways.\n\n334\n00:17:01.383 --> 00:17:02.395\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, little sideways.\n\n335\n00:17:02.395 --> 00:17:04.992\n&gt;&gt; That we're going,\nbecause look what happens now.\n\n336\n00:17:04.992 --> 00:17:06.580\nI can't edit that rule.\n\n337\n00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:11.589\nI can't see the rule because I\nedit it in the desktop version.\n\n338\n00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:12.158\n&gt;&gt; How about that.\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n339\n00:17:12.158 --> 00:17:13.632\n&gt;&gt; It's just on.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, exactly.\n\n340\n00:17:13.632 --> 00:17:20.517\nWe can just make sure that I have my\nsound on and we've got that there.\n\n341\n00:17:20.517 --> 00:17:26.053\nAnd now if we go ahead and, yes I know, we\ndon't want to talk about that right now.\n\n342\n00:17:26.053 --> 00:17:27.029\nSound works.\n\n343\n00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:28.207\n&gt;&gt; Sound is on.\n\n344\n00:17:28.207 --> 00:17:29.643\n&gt;&gt; Won't let me do it, will it?\n\n345\n00:17:29.643 --> 00:17:31.272\nOkay, let's just review.\n\n346\n00:17:31.272 --> 00:17:32.471\nAnd yes, I accept.\n\n347\n00:17:32.471 --> 00:17:34.058\nOkay, just accept, move on, let's go.\n\n348\n00:17:34.058 --> 00:17:35.043\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, let's go.\n\n349\n00:17:35.043 --> 00:17:35.803\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure what\n\n350\n00:17:35.803 --> 00:17:36.521\nthat just said, but hey.\n\n351\n00:17:36.521 --> 00:17:37.564\n&gt;&gt; Get out of my way, man.\n\n352\n00:17:37.564 --> 00:17:38.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hey, it's a virtual machine.\n\n353\n00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:39.685\nI could always blow it away.\n\n354\n00:17:39.685 --> 00:17:46.583\n[LAUGH] So let's go ahead and\nchoose from Joey.\n\n355\n00:17:46.583 --> 00:17:49.165\nAnd we will add test, and\nwe will send, and we'll jump over.\n\n356\n00:17:49.165 --> 00:17:52.064\n[NOISE]\n&gt;&gt; And it worked, hey!\n\n357\n00:17:52.064 --> 00:17:52.766\n&gt;&gt; Look at that!\n\n358\n00:17:52.766 --> 00:17:53.982\n&gt;&gt; We learn something new every day,\nright?\n\n359\n00:17:53.982 --> 00:17:54.877\n&gt;&gt; That was super cool!\n\n360\n00:17:54.877 --> 00:17:55.566\n&gt;&gt; That is super cool.\n\n361\n00:17:55.566 --> 00:17:56.463\n&gt;&gt; I was a little nervous.\n\n362\n00:17:56.463 --> 00:17:58.583\nI'm like, gosh I'm not sure\nthis is going to work, Danny,\n\n363\n00:17:58.583 --> 00:17:59.759\nyou're throwing me a curveball.\n\n364\n00:17:59.759 --> 00:18:01.099\nBut, that was awesome.\n\n365\n00:18:01.099 --> 00:18:02.114\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was, very good.\n\n366\n00:18:02.114 --> 00:18:03.425\n&gt;&gt; It did work.\n\n367\n00:18:03.425 --> 00:18:04.311\nWait.\n\n368\n00:18:04.311 --> 00:18:05.286\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n369\n00:18:05.286 --> 00:18:05.898\n&gt;&gt; I have this on.\n\n370\n00:18:05.898 --> 00:18:12.061\n[CROSSTALK] there was [LAUGH] well now\nyou're give me all sort of noises.\n\n371\n00:18:12.061 --> 00:18:17.745\nAll right, but that was like,\ngosh, did it work?\n\n372\n00:18:17.745 --> 00:18:18.761\nSo I did this have open.\n\n373\n00:18:18.761 --> 00:18:20.433\n[CROSSTALK] Okay, we'll retest.\n\n374\n00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:24.903\n[CROSSTALK] Close that down,\nokay, try it again.\n\n375\n00:18:24.903 --> 00:18:25.593\nThis is fun.\n\n376\n00:18:25.593 --> 00:18:26.979\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll try it.\n\n377\n00:18:26.979 --> 00:18:27.588\nOkay.\n\n378\n00:18:27.588 --> 00:18:28.526\nTest again.\n\n379\n00:18:28.526 --> 00:18:30.395\nTest, I don't really need test subject.\n\n380\n00:18:30.395 --> 00:18:30.920\n[CROSSTALK] Okay.\n\n381\n00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.213\n&gt;&gt; There it is!\n\n382\n00:18:34.213 --> 00:18:35.026\n&gt;&gt; Okay!\n&gt;&gt; Does work.\n\n383\n00:18:35.026 --> 00:18:35.557\n&gt;&gt; It was this.\n\n384\n00:18:35.557 --> 00:18:41.571\nOkay, we make sure our variables\nare closed and so it did work.\n\n385\n00:18:41.571 --> 00:18:42.544\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n386\n00:18:42.544 --> 00:18:46.617\nOkay, so, we have learned, I've learned\na very powerful lesson, right there.\n\n387\n00:18:46.617 --> 00:18:49.206\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; But you do have the desktop version to\n\n388\n00:18:49.206 --> 00:18:53.282\nadd the sound into the rule, but\nit will carry over and play that sound.\n\n389\n00:18:53.282 --> 00:18:54.216\nOkay, sweet.\n\n390\n00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:56.733\nAnd just install,\ndo a local install just for that.\n\n391\n00:18:56.733 --> 00:18:58.092\n&gt;&gt; Just for those purposes, right.\n\n392\n00:18:58.092 --> 00:18:59.190\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n393\n00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:01.023\nThat's pretty sweet.\n\n394\n00:19:01.023 --> 00:19:05.129\nAll right, so we have a few other things\nto talk about here when we've talking\n\n395\n00:19:05.129 --> 00:19:09.062\nabout our inbox rules because we're\ntalking about this sweep down here.\n\n396\n00:19:09.062 --> 00:19:11.151\nSweep is pretty neat.\n\n397\n00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:11.800\n&gt;&gt; Sweep delay.\n\n398\n00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.539\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n399\n00:19:12.539 --> 00:19:15.061\n&gt;&gt; Sweep delay Johnny, you gotta do it.\n\n400\n00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:19.124\n[LAUGH] So I wanted to do this on Lance's\naccount, because it's my test ground and\n\n401\n00:19:19.124 --> 00:19:20.330\neverything like that.\n\n402\n00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:24.211\nAnd this is where, it's kinda like a rule,\nbut it's kinda not.\n\n403\n00:19:24.211 --> 00:19:25.961\nIt's this, what does it do?\n\n404\n00:19:25.961 --> 00:19:31.560\nIt sweeps up all of the stuff you don't\nwant, just put it right out the door.\n\n405\n00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.913\nAnd it's based on a specific email and\na sender.\n\n406\n00:19:35.913 --> 00:19:41.177\nOkay so let's just talk about here\nthat maybe at this particular point,\n\n407\n00:19:41.177 --> 00:19:45.423\nwe'll come down here to Justin Timberlake,\nright here.\n\n408\n00:19:45.423 --> 00:19:50.631\nI don't want to have any more\nof Justin's emails here.\n\n409\n00:19:50.631 --> 00:19:52.952\nI want to just sweep them out of the way.\n\n410\n00:19:52.952 --> 00:19:57.782\nSo I've got this, and I noticed that this\nis a specific date, and if I go to sweep,\n\n411\n00:19:57.782 --> 00:20:00.232\nnotice that there's pretty cool stuff.\n\n412\n00:20:00.232 --> 00:20:04.592\nOkay, an email from Justin Timberlake,\nso it's based on your sender.\n\n413\n00:20:04.592 --> 00:20:09.782\nDo I want to delete all\nthe messages from the inbox?\n\n414\n00:20:09.782 --> 00:20:11.905\nJust throw them all out,\nI don't want that.\n\n415\n00:20:11.905 --> 00:20:14.184\nThis is where if you have,\nit's almost like a spam control.\n\n416\n00:20:14.184 --> 00:20:15.231\nIt’s not really spam.\n\n417\n00:20:15.231 --> 00:20:16.632\n&gt;&gt; Just cleaning up your inbox really.\n\n418\n00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:21.373\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so now the other thing is\nyou have the option to delete or archive.\n\n419\n00:20:21.373 --> 00:20:23.895\nNow we have a whole\nepisode on archiving but\n\n420\n00:20:23.895 --> 00:20:28.168\narchive is kind of like a well if you\nthink about what an archive in general\n\n421\n00:20:28.168 --> 00:20:31.862\nterms it's like we're just\n&gt;&gt; Storing it over here you're not gonna\n\n422\n00:20:31.862 --> 00:20:35.746\nreally see it or use it unless you\nabsolutely need it then you can go get it.\n\n423\n00:20:35.746 --> 00:20:37.110\n&gt;&gt; I call it almost like a back up drive.\n\n424\n00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.913\n&gt;&gt; Most people call it\nthe deleted items folder [LAUGH].\n\n425\n00:20:39.913 --> 00:20:43.334\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and just to show you and\nwe'll talk about this as well.\n\n426\n00:20:43.334 --> 00:20:46.049\n&gt;&gt; You can put it in the deleted items and\nyou can put it in the archives.\n\n427\n00:20:46.049 --> 00:20:47.068\nIt is almost like the same thing.\n\n428\n00:20:47.068 --> 00:20:48.493\nIt is just a place where you put stuff.\n\n429\n00:20:48.493 --> 00:20:50.643\n&gt;&gt; Here is the fun thing about\nthe deleted items folder.\n\n430\n00:20:50.643 --> 00:20:53.800\nAs working with\na multi-thousand user system,\n\n431\n00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.272\npeople tend to use that deleted\nitems folder as long-term storage.\n\n432\n00:20:58.272 --> 00:21:00.506\nAhh, because here is what happens.\n\n433\n00:21:00.506 --> 00:21:04.392\nIt grows in size by like,\nbecause you never delete anything.\n\n434\n00:21:04.392 --> 00:21:08.510\nEverybody gets frozen in fear that there\ngonna delete something that they need.\n\n435\n00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:12.572\nCreate folders use archive push those\nthings into somewhere that’s organized and\n\n436\n00:21:12.572 --> 00:21:15.254\nyou can get out them if you\nfeel like you will need them.\n\n437\n00:21:15.254 --> 00:21:19.381\nThe daily adds or whatever,\nit can definitely be deleted.\n\n438\n00:21:19.381 --> 00:21:23.722\nOkay, if you hit delete, It should be\nbecause you don't need that email.\n\n439\n00:21:23.722 --> 00:21:27.303\nAnd it’s going to delete that items\nfolder because you don't need that email.\n\n440\n00:21:27.303 --> 00:21:31.563\nRegularly, create a rule that once a week\ndeletes your deleted items because it will\n\n441\n00:21:31.563 --> 00:21:35.343\ngrow your mailbox into such size that\nwe're going to have to put limits on it\n\n442\n00:21:35.343 --> 00:21:37.143\nand it’s gonna delete it anyways.\n\n443\n00:21:37.143 --> 00:21:37.753\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n444\n00:21:37.753 --> 00:21:40.569\n&gt;&gt; Better not lose the thing\nthat you've organized and\n\n445\n00:21:40.569 --> 00:21:43.520\nthat you might need versus\nthe things that you don’t.\n\n446\n00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.260\nJust word of advice.\n\n447\n00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.107\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and like you said,\npeople treat it the same way, but\n\n448\n00:21:48.107 --> 00:21:51.788\narchiving is you really are storing it\naway untill maybe you might need it.\n\n449\n00:21:51.788 --> 00:21:54.650\nAnd it also deals with\nmailbox size when you\n\n450\n00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:57.355\narchive it\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't really attribute necessarily\n\n451\n00:21:57.355 --> 00:21:58.130\nto the overall.\n\n452\n00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:59.923\n&gt;&gt; It probably compresses it a whole lot.\n\n453\n00:21:59.923 --> 00:22:03.118\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and on the desktop version,\nthere's this PST files and\n\n454\n00:22:03.118 --> 00:22:04.032\nall that kind of.\n\n455\n00:22:04.032 --> 00:22:04.841\n&gt;&gt; Yes, OSTs.\n\n456\n00:22:04.841 --> 00:22:07.433\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in the online version you\ndon't really have any of that,\n\n457\n00:22:07.433 --> 00:22:09.452\nbut we are getting into\nthat particular episode.\n\n458\n00:22:09.452 --> 00:22:10.211\n&gt;&gt; You still have a mailbox.\n\n459\n00:22:10.211 --> 00:22:11.912\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And that mailbox is growing, so.\n\n460\n00:22:11.912 --> 00:22:12.412\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n461\n00:22:12.412 --> 00:22:14.776\n&gt;&gt; Be prepared for\nan IT worker one day to call you and\n\n462\n00:22:14.776 --> 00:22:16.571\ngo you have three terabyte mailbox?\n\n463\n00:22:16.571 --> 00:22:17.483\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n464\n00:22:17.483 --> 00:22:18.164\n&gt;&gt; This is no bueno.\n\n465\n00:22:18.164 --> 00:22:18.812\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n466\n00:22:18.812 --> 00:22:21.089\n&gt;&gt; And we will definitely talking about\n\n467\n00:22:21.089 --> 00:22:22.710\nthis on the archive show.\n\n468\n00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:26.025\nSo or episodes, we'll definitely\ngo with it but right here,\n\n469\n00:22:26.025 --> 00:22:29.786\nI'm just giving you the option and\nthe sweep either go to the deleted or\n\n470\n00:22:29.786 --> 00:22:31.913\ngo to the archive which is pretty cool.\n\n471\n00:22:31.913 --> 00:22:33.757\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Which we got that, so\n\n472\n00:22:33.757 --> 00:22:38.239\nand then notice like we had to\ndelete all messages in the inbox and\n\n473\n00:22:38.239 --> 00:22:43.144\nany future messages okay or\nkeep the latest line and then delete rest.\n\n474\n00:22:43.144 --> 00:22:46.933\nOkay.\nAnd then delete all always delete messages\n\n475\n00:22:46.933 --> 00:22:50.516\nthen notice there is always and\nalways okay.\n\n476\n00:22:50.516 --> 00:22:54.568\nIf you choose one of these,\nit then becomes a sweep rule that\n\n477\n00:22:54.568 --> 00:22:58.392\ngoes into the rules that we\nwere just in of our settings.\n\n478\n00:22:58.392 --> 00:23:00.267\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's why we didn't have any of\n\n479\n00:23:00.267 --> 00:23:03.553\nthem before cuz we didn't choose this and\nwe didn't choose our always.\n\n480\n00:23:03.553 --> 00:23:05.930\nSo it's kinda neat where if like and\nthis one.\n\n481\n00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.413\n&gt;&gt; It's like a one time versus every time.\n\n482\n00:23:07.413 --> 00:23:11.208\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I'm gonna put this in\nthe archive cuz that way if I'm playing\n\n483\n00:23:11.208 --> 00:23:15.140\naround with this, I can bring all of\nJustin's emails back into my inbox.\n\n484\n00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.315\nI just go ahead and select everything in\nthe archive, and then move it, just say,\n\n485\n00:23:18.315 --> 00:23:18.923\nmove to inbox.\n\n486\n00:23:18.923 --> 00:23:19.520\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n487\n00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.151\n&gt;&gt; So, this way,\nI'm not deleting, deleting.\n\n488\n00:23:22.151 --> 00:23:26.484\nI'm just gonna go ahead and do that for\nthis particular demonstration,\n\n489\n00:23:26.484 --> 00:23:27.772\nand then it's gone.\n\n490\n00:23:27.772 --> 00:23:29.150\n&gt;&gt; It is gone, there they go.\n\n491\n00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:34.143\n&gt;&gt; JT is not in there, and,\nin my archive, there's all the stuff from\n\n492\n00:23:34.143 --> 00:23:36.938\nJustin Timberlake\n&gt;&gt; So, pretty neat little rule,\n\n493\n00:23:36.938 --> 00:23:38.811\npretty cool little feature of sweeping.\n\n494\n00:23:38.811 --> 00:23:43.502\nTrying to get like just easier\naccess to just what's moving on out.\n\n495\n00:23:43.502 --> 00:23:45.051\nSo, pretty cool.\n\n496\n00:23:45.051 --> 00:23:47.174\nNice automation step right there.\n\n497\n00:23:47.174 --> 00:23:49.121\nAll right, another automation.\n\n498\n00:23:49.121 --> 00:23:55.635\nLet's go ahead and have a back here\nin Joey, let's email Justin, okay?\n\n499\n00:23:55.635 --> 00:24:02.920\nWe'll just go ahead and say,\nwe'll go jt and we will say lunch.\n\n500\n00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.426\nYeah, and then, we will send it,\nand we will move on.\n\n501\n00:24:06.426 --> 00:24:09.140\nAnd I'll push this off to the side,\nand I'll come to my inbox.\n\n502\n00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.121\nI'll go up to the beginning and\n[SOUND] there we go.\n\n503\n00:24:13.121 --> 00:24:15.158\nYou can see, hey guess what?\n\n504\n00:24:15.158 --> 00:24:21.561\n[LAUGH] Justin Timberlake has told\nme that he is out of the office.\n\n505\n00:24:21.561 --> 00:24:22.893\nOkay, that's the wrong one.\n\n506\n00:24:22.893 --> 00:24:24.213\n[SOUND] Okay why don't\nwe go ahead [LAUGH] and\n\n507\n00:24:24.213 --> 00:24:25.805\nexpand this out because I\nhad it in conversation.\n\n508\n00:24:25.805 --> 00:24:27.140\nSorry, guys.\n\n509\n00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.100\nAnd let's go ahead, and open up.\n\n510\n00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:29.693\nWell, there we go.\n\n511\n00:24:29.693 --> 00:24:30.869\nLet's do it over here.\n\n512\n00:24:30.869 --> 00:24:36.750\nDon't try to call me [LAUGH], because\nJustin said it's an automatic reply.\n\n513\n00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:39.210\n&gt;&gt; I should call and\nask him if that's fake or real [LAUGH].\n\n514\n00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:39.986\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n515\n00:24:39.986 --> 00:24:42.435\nThis is an out of office reply, okay?\n\n516\n00:24:42.435 --> 00:24:43.741\nThis is a really good thing to always do.\n\n517\n00:24:43.741 --> 00:24:45.080\n&gt;&gt; Really handy feature.\n\n518\n00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.330\n&gt;&gt; Yes, if I'm gonna be out of the office\nfor a week and people rely on me,\n\n519\n00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:53.485\nto contact me through my email,\njust tell them you're not there.\n\n520\n00:24:53.485 --> 00:24:56.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And it's very easy to turn on, and\n\n521\n00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.480\nit's made it easier.\n\n522\n00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.500\nBecause before, it's like you forget\nto turn it off because you have to\n\n523\n00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.070\nturn it on and turn it off.\n\n524\n00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.960\nNow, you can actually set dates.\n\n525\n00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.320\nLet's jump over here to JT, so we can see.\n\n526\n00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.580\nAnd I've already got it kinda\npulled up to where in the settings,\n\n527\n00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:10.550\non the right hand side.\n\n528\n00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:14.630\nI just go to automatic replies,\ncreate an automatic reply for\n\n529\n00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:17.150\nthe out-of-office message.\n\n530\n00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.700\nAnd then, we go ahead and try that again.\n\n531\n00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.820\nAnd I've had this happen,\nit gets a little glitchy.\n\n532\n00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.450\nLet me just go ahead and do a-\n&gt;&gt; A refresh.\n\n533\n00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:26.160\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nLet me go ahead, and refresh the browser.\n\n534\n00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:29.156\nYeah, this has happened\nto me quite a few times.\n\n535\n00:25:29.156 --> 00:25:31.240\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So, let's refresh.\n\n536\n00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.471\nNow, we'll come over to our settings.\n\n537\n00:25:33.471 --> 00:25:34.496\nThis is, this.\n\n538\n00:25:34.496 --> 00:25:35.280\n&gt;&gt; Has gone berserk.\n\n539\n00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:35.883\n&gt;&gt; Wow, okay.\n\n540\n00:25:35.883 --> 00:25:37.572\nWell, why don't we go ahead.\n\n541\n00:25:37.572 --> 00:25:38.296\n&gt;&gt; There we go!\n\n542\n00:25:38.296 --> 00:25:39.134\n&gt;&gt; And there we go!\n\n543\n00:25:39.134 --> 00:25:40.033\nAll right [LAUGH].\n\n544\n00:25:40.033 --> 00:25:41.625\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to the show, Outlook [LAUGH].\n\n545\n00:25:41.625 --> 00:25:45.025\n&gt;&gt; You know what that was,\nthat was loading up that CSS file.\n\n546\n00:25:45.025 --> 00:25:46.870\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it was just a drop-down menu,\nnow it's over here.\n\n547\n00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:48.710\nThat's what I'm thinking, I'm not sure.\n\n548\n00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:50.910\nOkay, [LAUGH] we'll go\nwith automatic replies.\n\n549\n00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:51.640\nThere we go.\n\n550\n00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.640\nNow, we're cooking with Crisco.\n\n551\n00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.460\nWe've got automatic replies.\n\n552\n00:25:55.460 --> 00:26:00.723\nAnd right now, you can see that it\nis set on send automatic replies.\n\n553\n00:26:00.723 --> 00:26:04.446\nAnd the cool thing is, is that if I\ndidn't check that on, then it's just on.\n\n554\n00:26:04.446 --> 00:26:05.279\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n555\n00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:09.440\nBut you check that box off, and\nI can set when I want it to turn off.\n\n556\n00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.746\nThat's really handy.\n\n557\n00:26:10.746 --> 00:26:12.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nBecause you're gonna forget\n\n558\n00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:13.996\nwhen you come back to the office,\nand guess what?\n\n559\n00:26:13.996 --> 00:26:16.630\nYour people are gonna be getting\nautomatic replies from you, and\n\n560\n00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:18.365\nyou're gonna be like,\nI need to go turn that off.\n\n561\n00:26:18.365 --> 00:26:19.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You will forget,\n\n562\n00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:21.560\nand it will cause consternation,\nevery time.\n\n563\n00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n564\n00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:27.240\nSo I like that they finally evolved into\nbeing able to set the time, on and off.\n\n565\n00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.270\nAnd notice that there's some\nother cool things in here.\n\n566\n00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:30.690\nYou can block my calendar.\n\n567\n00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:34.410\nYou can also decline any media\nrequests that we have going.\n\n568\n00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:36.610\nAnd then,\nnotice you have don't try to call me.\n\n569\n00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:38.400\nThat's probably not something\nyou wanna say to people.\n\n570\n00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.410\nBut notice, look.\n\n571\n00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:43.755\nIt's for inside your organization, so\nI can have an internal message for\n\n572\n00:26:43.755 --> 00:26:45.234\npeople that I work with.\n\n573\n00:26:45.234 --> 00:26:48.865\nLike, hey, just go ask Daniel,\nbut I'm not here.\n\n574\n00:26:48.865 --> 00:26:51.350\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And then, you also have the ones for\n\n575\n00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:55.460\nwhen you have people that have external\nsenders outside your organization.\n\n576\n00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.591\nSo if it's not from ITPro.TV,\nthen I'm out of the office and\n\n577\n00:26:59.591 --> 00:27:01.664\nwill return on August 23rd.\n\n578\n00:27:01.664 --> 00:27:02.320\n&gt;&gt; 31st.\n\n579\n00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.680\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, [LAUGH] and so,\nthat's what we've got going on there.\n\n580\n00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.760\nAnd it's very easy to set, okay?\n\n581\n00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.486\nAnd it's just right there in the settings.\n\n582\n00:27:09.486 --> 00:27:10.111\n&gt;&gt; Very straight forward.\n\n583\n00:27:10.111 --> 00:27:13.897\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,and just I'm not here,\ngo ahead and set that.\n\n584\n00:27:13.897 --> 00:27:16.700\nSo, there is JT's setting.\n\n585\n00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:21.391\nNow, the only other thing that I wanted to\njust touch on here is something that is\n\n586\n00:27:21.391 --> 00:27:23.020\nclutter, okay?\n\n587\n00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:29.070\nBut the thing is clutter has kind\nof gone to the wayside, all right?\n\n588\n00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:32.931\nClutter is, and I think it's a couple of\nyears ago that they introduced it, and\n\n589\n00:27:32.931 --> 00:27:35.987\nit's saying moves low priority\nmessages out of your inbox, so\n\n590\n00:27:35.987 --> 00:27:38.620\nyou can easily scan for\nimportant messages.\n\n591\n00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.530\nOkay, cool, right?\n\n592\n00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:44.866\nWell the thing is, is that the thing.\n\n593\n00:27:44.866 --> 00:27:49.794\nWell, what was clutter is\nnow the Focused Inbox.\n\n594\n00:27:49.794 --> 00:27:51.060\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay, so.\n\n595\n00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:54.580\nAnd we've talked about that, where\nthat it has the Focused and the other.\n\n596\n00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.159\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and it's not getting sent to our\n\n597\n00:27:57.159 --> 00:28:00.754\njunk, it's just determining that\nthis is a low priority email.\n\n598\n00:28:00.754 --> 00:28:02.972\nI'm gonna put it in the other,\nand that's it.\n\n599\n00:28:02.972 --> 00:28:04.550\nSo says it, right there.\n\n600\n00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:08.311\nOkay, so Focused kills clutter eventually,\nand that's what we.\n\n601\n00:28:08.311 --> 00:28:10.980\nAnd now,\njunk is something different though.\n\n602\n00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.248\nIt's like they have\nthe clutter intelligence, and\n\n603\n00:28:14.248 --> 00:28:16.780\nthe junk intelligence, if you want to.\n\n604\n00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:21.678\nAnd so, it's thinking about all this, and\nit is going to determine where it goes.\n\n605\n00:28:21.678 --> 00:28:23.560\nBut that's what I wanted to let you know.\n\n606\n00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:29.180\nThat it does exist, and\nyou can turn it on if you wanted to.\n\n607\n00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:32.180\nIf you go into the mail,\nit's right over here.\n\n608\n00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:37.740\nSo it's there, but again,\nyou've got your Focused Inbox, now.\n\n609\n00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.870\nSo I probably wouldn't turn on both,\nyou've got them in there, but-\n\n610\n00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:43.340\n&gt;&gt; I've found clutter to be extremely\n\n611\n00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.530\nconfusing in the way it was operating,\nso I just shut it off.\n\n612\n00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:51.277\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's funny, because I've read\na couple of other articles of like when\n\n613\n00:28:51.277 --> 00:28:54.395\nthis came out, everyone was like\nwhat is this, and it's all like.\n\n614\n00:28:54.395 --> 00:28:57.660\nAnd the person that was writing it was\nlike, I trained it pretty well, but\n\n615\n00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.096\nit took a while to kind of\nunderstand what's going on.\n\n616\n00:29:00.096 --> 00:29:02.174\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n617\n00:29:02.174 --> 00:29:04.151\n&gt;&gt; But then,\nthey kind of went over to Focused, and\n\n618\n00:29:04.151 --> 00:29:05.803\nthere was another retraining process.\n\n619\n00:29:05.803 --> 00:29:07.539\nBut now,\nit's kind of caught up with itself.\n\n620\n00:29:07.539 --> 00:29:08.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n621\n00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:11.770\n&gt;&gt; So just use your Focused Inbox, or\nif you don't want to use Focused Inbox,\n\n622\n00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:13.050\nyou can turn it on.\n\n623\n00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:16.720\nIt's up to you, but at least you\nknow that this service is available.\n\n624\n00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.890\nBut I think it's gonna probably be-\n&gt;&gt; Phased out.\n\n625\n00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:21.110\n&gt;&gt; Phased out, yes.\n\n626\n00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:22.300\nSo, taken out of commission.\n\n627\n00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:22.830\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n628\n00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.580\n&gt;&gt; All right, and that's what I've got for\nrules and automation.\n\n629\n00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:26.450\nLots of fun stuff.\n\n630\n00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:28.060\nI love writing rules.\n\n631\n00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.200\nIt's a nice little thing.\n\n632\n00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n633\n00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.515\n&gt;&gt; Like I am not gonna get\nan email from you, Daniel.\n\n634\n00:29:32.515 --> 00:29:35.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And to me, it's the part of my brain\n\n635\n00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:40.960\nthat likes to tweak, and turn, and\nadjust, and make fine tunings on things.\n\n636\n00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.280\nRules are great for that.\n\n637\n00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.620\nThey can really make your email experience\na whole lot better than what comes out of\n\n638\n00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:49.380\nthe box from Microsoft, so take advantage\nof them, they're a lot of fun to write.\n\n639\n00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:53.000\nAnd they just make your life a whole lot\neasier, when it comes to getting mail,\n\n640\n00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.950\norganizing mail, staying organized,\nand it's doing it all for you.\n\n641\n00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.760\nIt's a little work on the front end,\nbut as soon as that's done, man,\n\n642\n00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.120\nyour email life is off to the races,\nand it's smooth sailing.\n\n643\n00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.150\nSo great stuff.\n\n644\n00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.680\nWell, thanks for showing us how to make\nthese adjustments inside of Outlook.\n\n645\n00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.770\nWell, it looks like our time's has\nadjusted itself to zero for this episode,\n\n646\n00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:12.220\nso we're gonna call it a day.\n\n647\n00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.470\nSigning off for OfficePro.TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n648\n00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:16.080\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n649\n00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.113\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

Why thank you, I am awesome today cuz\nwe're gonna be talking about archiving.\n\n10\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.809\nWell, that didn't really match very well.\n\n11\n00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.594\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's just nowhere to go there.\n\n12\n00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:40.922\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, I was like okay,\n\n13\n00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:44.105\nwell it starts with a, cuz then every\ntime you introduce I'm like okay,\n\n14\n00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:46.621\nwhat am I gonna say about when\nhe's asking how am I doing?\n\n15\n00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:50.077\nAnd I'm like we're talking about\narchiving so do an a, awesome, okay,\n\n16\n00:00:50.077 --> 00:00:52.245\nyeah I'm awesome, but it doesn't really.\n\n17\n00:00:52.245 --> 00:00:54.945\nWe just got that alliteration with the a,\nthat's all I've got, so.\n\n18\n00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:58.909\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well grab your animals two by two,\n\n19\n00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.388\ncuz we're gonna arc.\n\n20\n00:01:00.388 --> 00:01:02.028\n&gt;&gt; See that's so good, man.\n\n21\n00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:03.276\n&gt;&gt; I try.\n\n22\n00:01:03.276 --> 00:01:05.373\n&gt;&gt; Not as clever as you there, Daniel.\n\n23\n00:01:05.373 --> 00:01:05.942\n&gt;&gt; In my moment.\n\n24\n00:01:05.942 --> 00:01:07.114\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n25\n00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:10.827\nwe are gonna be talking about\narchiving in this episode.\n\n26\n00:01:10.827 --> 00:01:15.457\nAnd this is, I'll be completely honest,\narchiving is a little,\n\n27\n00:01:15.457 --> 00:01:18.199\nit's a little weird with me in my head.\n\n28\n00:01:18.199 --> 00:01:22.857\nI understand the concepts and I understand\nwhat it does and everything, but\n\n29\n00:01:22.857 --> 00:01:26.586\nit's kind of like I thought it\nwas more than it was, that it-\n\n30\n00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:29.066\n&gt;&gt; It seems very complex.\n\n31\n00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:29.619\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n32\n00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.687\n&gt;&gt; I'm archiving, I'm saving things,\nand doing stuff, and\n\n33\n00:01:33.687 --> 00:01:37.696\nmaybe even some compression\nof stuff is involved, right?\n\n34\n00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:38.950\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and that's where,\n\n35\n00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.086\nI mean I think this is also coming\nmore from the desktop versions.\n\n36\n00:01:42.086 --> 00:01:45.236\nBecause before there was even\nOffice 365 and the cloud,\n\n37\n00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:48.764\nI mean everything was hard coded\nif you wanna say, hard wired, and\n\n38\n00:01:48.764 --> 00:01:52.239\nyou had your servers, and the spaces,\nand all that kinda stuff.\n\n39\n00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:57.438\nAnd there's this OST files and\nthe PST files and if you set them and then\n\n40\n00:01:57.438 --> 00:02:03.190\nyou go ahead and compress them, and it\nwas always a little kind of weird to me.\n\n41\n00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.850\nBut it's really very simple.\n\n42\n00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.381\nI mean, on the desktop version if\nyou think about what archive is,\n\n43\n00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:11.155\nlet's just backup for a second.\n\n44\n00:02:11.155 --> 00:02:15.655\nIn general,\nif we're archiving I think of old scripts,\n\n45\n00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:18.898\nold scrolls set in-\n&gt;&gt; It's some cave somewhere,\n\n46\n00:02:18.898 --> 00:02:23.138\nthey're lining a wall on a wood shelf and\nthere's monks walking around.\n\n47\n00:02:23.138 --> 00:02:26.497\n&gt;&gt; And I've been watching way too\nmuch Game of Thrones, right now,\n\n48\n00:02:26.497 --> 00:02:28.710\nit was just on just\nthis last past episode.\n\n49\n00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.046\nSo it's just yeah, that's what I envision,\nyou've archived all this stuff.\n\n50\n00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:37.457\nWell it's the same idea, archiving is\ngoing ahead and putting it into a storage\n\n51\n00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:43.150\narea in case you need to be able to access\nit later and be able to bring it out.\n\n52\n00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.160\nAnd so in that sense okay,\n\n53\n00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.240\nso if I put it into my archive\nfolder then that's what we do.\n\n54\n00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.708\nNow again, while I'm talking back on the\ndesktop version there is always this okay,\n\n55\n00:02:52.708 --> 00:02:56.305\nwell then if you compress it into this\nOST file and PST file I'm like so\n\n56\n00:02:56.305 --> 00:02:57.382\nwhere does that go?\n\n57\n00:02:57.382 --> 00:03:00.460\nWell it's really just compressing it,\nit's like vacuum out the air,\n\n58\n00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.214\nlike with those bags to suck out the air.\n\n59\n00:03:02.214 --> 00:03:06.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all sorts of meat in here and\nstore it for 16 years, and yeah.\n\n60\n00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nit's the exact same thing.\n\n61\n00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n62\n00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.918\n&gt;&gt; And then maybe because\nof the sizes of mailboxes,\n\n63\n00:03:11.918 --> 00:03:15.342\nand the size of the server\nyou're always having to do that,\n\n64\n00:03:15.342 --> 00:03:19.932\nand companies were going ahead and making\nyour PST files to just have this backup\n\n65\n00:03:19.932 --> 00:03:24.479\nin case you needed it, or transfer\ncomputers, and all that kind of fun stuff.\n\n66\n00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:31.189\nSo that all still exists, okay, but\nthis show is Outlook on the Web.\n\n67\n00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:36.026\nAnd so when we're talking about Outlook\non the web, and Office 365 accounts or\n\n68\n00:03:36.026 --> 00:03:39.390\nfree accounts,\nnow you're getting into the all right,\n\n69\n00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.218\nwell you have this much\nspace available to you.\n\n70\n00:03:42.218 --> 00:03:45.968\nIt's almost like buying an iPhone, or any\ntype of phone, you have a 16 gig iPhone so\n\n71\n00:03:45.968 --> 00:03:47.520\nthat's how much space you have.\n\n72\n00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.021\nIf you start filling that up,\n\n73\n00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:52.562\nyou're gonna have to get to a point\nwhere it's like hey, guess what,\n\n74\n00:03:52.562 --> 00:03:56.542\nwe're at a point where we're at capacity,\nyou gotta start deleting photos.\n\n75\n00:03:56.542 --> 00:04:00.672\nI get those ones all the time of okay,\ndon't have enough space anymore, gotta.\n\n76\n00:04:00.672 --> 00:04:01.456\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n77\n00:04:01.456 --> 00:04:04.837\n&gt;&gt; And that's the same idea\nthat we're doing here,\n\n78\n00:04:04.837 --> 00:04:08.783\nright, is you have enough\nspace that you're allotted and\n\n79\n00:04:08.783 --> 00:04:13.393\nso you can go ahead and put it in\nthe archive folder and that's fine.\n\n80\n00:04:13.393 --> 00:04:18.296\nBut it's still going to keep\nthe same size of your mailbox, and\n\n81\n00:04:18.296 --> 00:04:23.754\nthat's the one thing that can be\na little misleading in a sense because\n\n82\n00:04:23.754 --> 00:04:30.410\nit's if I'm archiving I thought I'm gonna\nbe keeping space out of my mailbox.\n\n83\n00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.460\nIn this sense, not really okay, and\nthis is where we actually had this\n\n84\n00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.740\nright before the show started where I\nactually went out and talked to Ronnie.\n\n85\n00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.459\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n86\n00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:40.570\ncuz Ronnie knows a lot about Office 365.\n\n87\n00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.130\n&gt;&gt; Consulted the Office\n365 oracle of ITProTV.\n\n88\n00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.850\n&gt;&gt; Seriously, he's the admin guy so\nhe knew, and so we had a look and\n\n89\n00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.100\neverything like that.\n\n90\n00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.500\nAnd this is where I just wanted to clarify\nthat hey, putting it into the archive\n\n91\n00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.470\nfolder doesn't just automatically\nmake more space for you, right?\n\n92\n00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.850\nIn the cloud version he's like correct,\n\n93\n00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.393\nunless you have a certain\nsubscription level.\n\n94\n00:05:04.393 --> 00:05:08.500\nCuz we have the Office,\nwhat is it, the Pro Plus and\n\n95\n00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.394\nthen we also have Enterprise Licensing.\n\n96\n00:05:10.394 --> 00:05:14.523\nE1s I think three and five, and\nI have this in the show notes,\n\n97\n00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:20.900\nthere's an article that actually shows\nthat it just depends on what type\n\n98\n00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.350\nof subscription you have whether or\nnot your archiving actually is a separate\n\n99\n00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.990\nstorage area that has its own size limit\ndifferently than your mailbox size.\n\n100\n00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.880\nAnd actually, why don't we go ahead and\npull up my computer just so I can show you\n\n101\n00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.650\nthis, and this is the website and I have\nit in the show notes and everything.\n\n102\n00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.120\nSo it's just talking about how,\nsee it's a 50 gig mailbox okay, and\n\n103\n00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.950\nthat's what we've got, and then it's\nsaying important to understand that\n\n104\n00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.600\nthe unlimited archive is an E3 feature.\n\n105\n00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.510\nOtherwise, it's basically saying\nit's a combined total for\n\n106\n00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.640\nall of your stuff, and\nI'm not reading this verbatim but\n\n107\n00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.530\nI'm just kind of letting you know\nthat that's what's going on so\n\n108\n00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.850\nthat you understand just putting it\nthere doesn't free up space necessarily.\n\n109\n00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.470\nDesktop versions you get into those\nPST and OST files, then it compresses,\n\n110\n00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:20.580\nthen it does actually give you more space,\nbut we're not on that version here.\n\n111\n00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.420\nAnd this is another thing\nthat if you're working for\n\n112\n00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.680\nan organization, honestly you\nprobably have no control over this.\n\n113\n00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.374\n[LAUGH] In the sense of they have set,\nhopefully,\n\n114\n00:06:32.374 --> 00:06:35.977\na specific policy as that\nyou need to go ahead and\n\n115\n00:06:35.977 --> 00:06:40.683\ndelete emails that are over six\nmonths old, or two years old.\n\n116\n00:06:40.683 --> 00:06:42.120\nYou know all about the [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n117\n00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.683\nyou are at the whim of the god Outlookius\nand may he feel favor towards you or\n\n118\n00:06:47.683 --> 00:06:53.874\nnot is really up to what the legal stance\nof the company, is typically where it is,\n\n119\n00:06:53.874 --> 00:06:58.763\nbecause that archiving,\nit's a retention policy, how long?\n\n120\n00:06:58.763 --> 00:07:03.457\nIf we don't have a policy set then those\nfiles could be used in a legal sense for\n\n121\n00:07:03.457 --> 00:07:07.305\nwhatever reason,\nmaybe it will never happen, maybe it will.\n\n122\n00:07:07.305 --> 00:07:11.734\nI've been involved with companies that it\nhas happened so that changed our policy\n\n123\n00:07:11.734 --> 00:07:15.454\nto be we don't use OSTs and\nPSTs because then we're legally bound and\n\n124\n00:07:15.454 --> 00:07:18.103\ngive those over any lawyer\never subpoenas them.\n\n125\n00:07:18.103 --> 00:07:21.490\nIf we don't, if we have a policy that says\nwe don't use them, well then they're not\n\n126\n00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.400\nthere to give, right, so\nit could just fall under that spectrum.\n\n127\n00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then you throw in the whole\nif you work for a government organization,\n\n128\n00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:29.462\neverything public record.\n\n129\n00:07:29.462 --> 00:07:34.920\nI mean, these are things that as an end\nuser I just want you to be aware\n\n130\n00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.170\nof what is an archive, how it works.\n\n131\n00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:42.130\nBut you have to consult your particular\ncompany as to what your rules\n\n132\n00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:47.361\nare to how you save emails,\nhow you don't save emails, what is there?\n\n133\n00:07:47.361 --> 00:07:51.144\nSo there's a lot of aspects that,\nhonestly, they go over my head too,\n\n134\n00:07:51.144 --> 00:07:54.000\nto where it's like hey,\nI'll just let the big boys-\n\n135\n00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.866\n&gt;&gt; That's lawyer stuff, man.\n\n136\n00:07:55.866 --> 00:07:58.806\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, let them figure it out And\nall that, so\n\n137\n00:07:58.806 --> 00:08:03.613\nthe things that I'm going to show you of\nwhere the settings are and everything,\n\n138\n00:08:03.613 --> 00:08:08.346\nyou might not even see this, it's like,\nno, this is completely off limits,\n\n139\n00:08:08.346 --> 00:08:11.518\nyou have no control over this,\nso just consult it.\n\n140\n00:08:11.518 --> 00:08:14.592\nNow if you're not in a company and\nyou're just using this as for\n\n141\n00:08:14.592 --> 00:08:17.782\nmy own personal use, this is where\nit's just kind of that whole,\n\n142\n00:08:17.782 --> 00:08:21.958\njust don't keep what you don't need,\n&gt;&gt; Right, I think of it like kinda moving\n\n143\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:26.750\nback to that monkeyish archive room that\nyou have, I think of a library, right?\n\n144\n00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.570\nYou have a library, it's got x amount\nof space inside of it to hold books.\n\n145\n00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.720\nWell, we want books that are actually\nrelevant to people that might wanna\n\n146\n00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.770\ncome in and borrow those books, but\nwe don't wanna necessarily destroy or\n\n147\n00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.970\nget rid of the books that have\nkinda fallen out of relevancy,\n\n148\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.210\nso we put it in the archive room.\n\n149\n00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.444\nIf we need those books,\nwe can go out there and get them, but\n\n150\n00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:51.859\nthey're not cluttering up the main face\nof the data that we have available to us.\n\n151\n00:08:51.859 --> 00:08:53.290\n&gt;&gt; And, it's like you say,\nit's still the same space.\n\n152\n00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.420\nAnd then once you go back, and maybe after\ntwo years, you go to that archive room and\n\n153\n00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.418\nrealize, you know what, we really don't\nneed these, let's just go ahead and\n\n154\n00:08:59.418 --> 00:08:59.980\ndelete them.\n\n155\n00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:00.678\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just get rid of it.\n\n156\n00:09:00.678 --> 00:09:02.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n157\n00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.080\nAnd that's where, well, then what's the\ndifference between your Archive folder and\n\n158\n00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.870\nyour Deleted Items folder?\n\n159\n00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.510\nWell, it's kind of more on the lines\nof what he's talking about.\n\n160\n00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:14.715\nYou might need it later, but you-\n&gt;&gt; Deleted items is, I don't need this,\n\n161\n00:09:14.715 --> 00:09:15.820\ndelete it.\n\n162\n00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.815\nAnd then eventually I'll get around to,\n\n163\n00:09:17.815 --> 00:09:21.520\nhopefully in some sort scheduled\nmaintenance of your Deleted Items folder,\n\n164\n00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.260\nof deleting the things in\nyour Deleted Items folder.\n\n165\n00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.095\nIt doesn't delete just cuz you hit,\nsend to Deleted Items.\n\n166\n00:09:27.095 --> 00:09:30.132\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we've talked about this where\nit's like you throw something in the trash\n\n167\n00:09:30.132 --> 00:09:32.142\nbut you haven't actually\ntaken it out to the dumpster,\n\n168\n00:09:32.142 --> 00:09:34.431\nand then it's taken away to the landfill,\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n169\n00:09:34.431 --> 00:09:40.500\nSo it is more of a, just get in the habit\nof keeping your stuff organized.\n\n170\n00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.504\nYou don't have to hold every single email,\nyou really don't,\n\n171\n00:09:44.504 --> 00:09:47.259\nso you have to kinda\nstart letting go [LAUGH].\n\n172\n00:09:47.259 --> 00:09:50.513\n&gt;&gt; Yes, take the pacifier out,\nI know it's hard to let go of.\n\n173\n00:09:50.513 --> 00:09:53.136\nI've got a daughter who's going\nthrough that right now, and\n\n174\n00:09:53.136 --> 00:09:56.266\nit's a little unnerving, but\neventually someone will hold your hand and\n\n175\n00:09:56.266 --> 00:09:58.400\nguide you through it, and you'll be fine.\n\n176\n00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, and so that's where\njust kind of abide by those rules,\n\n177\n00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.230\nand you'll be fine.\n\n178\n00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.271\nAnd you won't get,\ncuz you were talking about this before,\n\n179\n00:10:08.271 --> 00:10:11.132\nyou won't get your IT people\ncoming to you and be like, so\n\n180\n00:10:11.132 --> 00:10:14.303\nyou're the worst offender on\nthe biggest mailbox, right?\n\n181\n00:10:14.303 --> 00:10:17.527\n&gt;&gt; Man, we had some people that would not,\nI don't care what it was,\n\n182\n00:10:17.527 --> 00:10:19.371\nif it was ads for Toyota or something,\n\n183\n00:10:19.371 --> 00:10:23.260\nthey're like, I better put that\nin my Deleted Items folder.\n\n184\n00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.310\nWell, are you deleting it?\n\n185\n00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.270\nWell, no, I can't delete the stuff\nin my Deleted Items folder.\n\n186\n00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.380\nWhy not?\n\n187\n00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.210\nBecause I might need that.\n\n188\n00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.320\nI don't think you need that ad.\n\n189\n00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.210\n&gt;&gt;

Well, the trouble came in the fact\nthat they were not organizing what was\n\n194\n00:10:42.616 --> 00:10:43.122\ngoing in.\n\n195\n00:10:43.122 --> 00:10:45.881\nThey were treating deleted\nitems as archived, so\n\n196\n00:10:45.881 --> 00:10:49.951\nthings that they did need to delete,\nthat Toyota ad for a new car, right,\n\n197\n00:10:49.951 --> 00:10:52.360\nshould go in the Deleted Items folder.\n\n198\n00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.963\nBut because they were mingling it with\nthings that they actually may need later\n\n199\n00:10:55.963 --> 00:10:59.786\ndown the road but wanted some long-term\nstorage so that it wasn't in their Inbox,\n\n200\n00:10:59.786 --> 00:11:01.280\ncluttering it up, guess what?\n\n201\n00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.160\nThere's an Archive folder waiting for\nyou, just put it in there.\n\n202\n00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.860\nSeparate the two so\nthat you can empty your trash.\n\n203\n00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:12.050\nIt's not crippling you\nwith fear of deletion\n\n204\n00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.670\nthat you might have something in there.\n\n205\n00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.240\nSo keep those things organized, use that\nArchive folder, it'll really help you out.\n\n206\n00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.442\n&gt;&gt; And again,\nthis is not an Outlook thing.\n\n207\n00:11:18.442 --> 00:11:19.005\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n208\n00:11:19.005 --> 00:11:20.071\n&gt;&gt; This is more of a mental thing, really.\n\n209\n00:11:20.071 --> 00:11:21.180\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is, it really is.\n\n210\n00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:27.280\n&gt;&gt; It's your brain thing of how you have\nto think about and treat the content of\n\n211\n00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.350\nyour, I think that's honestly the best way\nyou could describe it, so that's awesome.\n\n212\n00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.630\nSo let's just jump down into another\nwebsite that I had as well, and\n\n213\n00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:40.540\nthis is where we have Retention\npolicies and Archive policies here, so.\n\n214\n00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:45.183\nIt says when you use Retention policies,\nit's basically just kind of a policy of\n\n215\n00:11:45.183 --> 00:11:47.984\nhow it's going to take and\ntreat your messages,\n\n216\n00:11:47.984 --> 00:11:52.101\nof how long it needs to stay somewhere\nbefore it's moved to an archive.\n\n217\n00:11:52.101 --> 00:11:55.150\nAnd then, after it's been archived for\nso long, what's the deleted setting?\n\n218\n00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.781\nSo this is, again, things that you might\nnot have control over, but it's saying,\n\n219\n00:11:59.781 --> 00:12:03.450\nthis is an optional feature, and\nit might not be available to you.\n\n220\n00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.688\nSo it kinda just goes through, and\n\n221\n00:12:05.688 --> 00:12:08.940\nit shows you where you can\nfind some of this stuff.\n\n222\n00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:13.730\nAgain, you might not even be able to\ndo it, but it has different settings of\n\n223\n00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:18.617\nwhat you can do when, where, how,\nat a more of an admin level than you have.\n\n224\n00:12:18.617 --> 00:12:21.470\nBut let me also just go ahead and\ngive you a little demonstration.\n\n225\n00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.670\nSo I have JT's account, and\nyou can see that right now,\n\n226\n00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:30.000\nif I open up this particular\nemail right here.\n\n227\n00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.018\nYou see where it has a label that it says,\na one month delete?\n\n228\n00:12:34.018 --> 00:12:39.292\nOoh, okay, so I assigned a policy\nto this email, and that's, again,\n\n229\n00:12:39.292 --> 00:12:45.620\nif you have your administration is set up,\nthese are the policies, you can assign it.\n\n230\n00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.840\nThis is, as an end user, you do have some\nof this control, if it's even set up for\n\n231\n00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.016\nyou to begin with, okay?\n\n232\n00:12:51.016 --> 00:12:52.850\nSo that's where we've got that, and\n\n233\n00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:56.760\nif I scroll on down here\nto maybe some of this one.\n\n234\n00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.300\nOkay, so this one has a different label.\n\n235\n00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:05.406\nThis one is labeled as\na Marketing Default [LAUGH] nine months.\n\n236\n00:13:05.406 --> 00:13:10.200\nAnd it's funny, because I'm using this\naccount, me and Ronnie, we share this.\n\n237\n00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.590\nAll of a sudden one day,\nall my emails kept getting this label.\n\n238\n00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.848\nI was like, what just happened?\n\n239\n00:13:14.848 --> 00:13:18.280\nWell, Ronnie, at an admin level,\nwent ahead and\n\n240\n00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:23.837\nassigned my entire JT account, the whole\nmailbox has that particular setting,\n\n241\n00:13:23.837 --> 00:13:27.271\nthat every email will\nhave a nine-month policy,\n\n242\n00:13:27.271 --> 00:13:31.954\nand that's where, I think it goes\ninto archive after nine months.\n\n243\n00:13:31.954 --> 00:13:34.080\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe it goes right to delete.\n\n244\n00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.990\nHe set it, and he's like,\nI don't even remember doing that.\n\n245\n00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.543\nHe's like, yeah,\nI did it in that one show.\n\n246\n00:13:38.543 --> 00:13:39.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n247\n00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.062\nit's kind of one of those types of things.\n\n248\n00:13:42.062 --> 00:13:45.320\nSo let me just show you, if I take\nthis and I right-click on this email,\n\n249\n00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.460\ndo you see where it says Assign Policy?\n\n250\n00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:54.040\nNotice that I only have a one-month\noption, and then I also have Use parent\n\n251\n00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.197\nfolder policy, that was the whole,\nthe Justin Timberlake folder.\n\n252\n00:13:59.197 --> 00:14:02.150\nThe whole user account has that.\n\n253\n00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.310\nAnd he was, of course, in one of his\nepisodes using that as a demonstration.\n\n254\n00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:10.200\nSo, this is where, if you do have\npolicies assigned, you can go ahead and\n\n255\n00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.730\nadd them right to your emails.\n\n256\n00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.390\nAnd that's the kinda nice thing,\nyou know what, this one's not that great.\n\n257\n00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:17.090\nI might need it, that ad,\ncuz it's gonna run out in a month, but\n\n258\n00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:20.490\nI was really thinking about buying a new\nToyota or whatever, but I'll put like,\n\n259\n00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.810\nyou know what,\nafter one month go ahead and delete it.\n\n260\n00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:23.473\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n261\n00:14:23.473 --> 00:14:27.658\nyou can set this to help\norganizing yourself.\n\n262\n00:14:27.658 --> 00:14:32.892\nNow, JT is an admin on this account,\nso he could go ahead and\n\n263\n00:14:32.892 --> 00:14:37.620\nmake some other things and\nsome retention policies.\n\n264\n00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:42.210\nAnd I'll show you in your Settings, if I\ngo down to the Mail settings, and then I\n\n265\n00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:48.860\ncome over here to some of our Retention,\nthere it is, Retention Policies.\n\n266\n00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.650\nAgain, if you don't see this,\nit's okay, you're not supposed to.\n\n267\n00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:54.369\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, and then, it's taking a second\n\n268\n00:14:54.369 --> 00:14:59.010\nto load, and it should go ahead and,\nno, we got the spinning wheel.\n\n269\n00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:03.380\nAnyways, it'll go ahead and give us,\nin a minute, a list of different policies,\n\n270\n00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.912\nthere we go, that have been created,\nand notice that it says, all right,\n\n271\n00:15:07.912 --> 00:15:13.832\nthere's what it's gonna do, all right,\nand I could add a policy into this,\n\n272\n00:15:13.832 --> 00:15:17.575\nI see, these are the ones that have\nbeen set at another admin level.\n\n273\n00:15:17.575 --> 00:15:20.615\nHey, I wanna do a five-year delete, okay?\n\n274\n00:15:20.615 --> 00:15:25.194\nSo, wow, after five years, it'll finally\ndelete it, or a one-year, or a one-week,\n\n275\n00:15:25.194 --> 00:15:26.115\nor never delete.\n\n276\n00:15:26.115 --> 00:15:27.665\nThat might be-\n&gt;&gt;

Exactly, so you can go ahead, and\nthat's where hey, maybe like the five\n\n286\n00:15:58.412 --> 00:16:02.449\nyears is a little much but you can go\nahead and you can start doing this.\n\n287\n00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:05.694\nNow if you don't you could maybe try\nto add ones that are in here but\n\n288\n00:16:05.694 --> 00:16:09.730\nif it's not on this list, how could\nI go ahead and create my own that's.\n\n289\n00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:13.690\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's something that you can set\n\n294\n00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:34.430\nwhere it will delete your deleted\nitems folder every time you sign out.\n\n295\n00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.190\nAnd it's somewhere in here,\n[LAUGH] there it is.\n\n296\n00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:41.140\nYes, I found it.\nSo message options,\n\n297\n00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.870\nempty the deleted items when I sign out.\n\n298\n00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.095\n&gt;&gt;

[INAUDIBLE] an informational episode\nmore than it is a show and tell.\n\n339\n00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nit does get a little cloudy for\n\n340\n00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.500\npeople of I don't have\nany control over it.\n\n341\n00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.380\nJust make the mental note,\n\n342\n00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.890\ndelete, delete, archive,\nyou might want to keep, and that's it.\n\n343\n00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.440\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\nI think this was a very good show as far\n\n344\n00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.710\nas the information it was informational.\n\n345\n00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.350\nBut its very good information for\n\n346\n00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:12.230\nyou as an end user to know what's\nhappening with older email.\n\n347\n00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:17.260\nThere is some behind the scenes things\nthat are going on that dictate why or\n\n348\n00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.555\nwhy not If not,\nyou would keep older agendas around, and\n\n349\n00:19:19.555 --> 00:19:22.755\nhow can we organize older stuff\nthat I do want to retain?\n\n350\n00:19:22.755 --> 00:19:24.935\nSo, it's been a very good thing.\n\n351\n00:19:24.935 --> 00:19:27.365\nVonne, anything else that we need\nto cover before we call it a day?\n\n352\n00:19:27.365 --> 00:19:29.655\n&gt;&gt; Just make sure you like what I say,\ntalk back to,\n\n353\n00:19:29.655 --> 00:19:33.957\nI'm thinking, I know that email was\nthere but it was two years ago.\n\n354\n00:19:33.957 --> 00:19:36.027\nAnd you're like, why is this gone?\n\n355\n00:19:36.027 --> 00:19:37.207\nI know it was there.\n\n356\n00:19:37.207 --> 00:19:40.397\nIt's probably because they have\nthat delete after two years policy.\n\n357\n00:19:40.397 --> 00:19:45.437\nAnd so make sure you talk to them and\njust like- I don't know why this is gone.\n\n358\n00:19:45.437 --> 00:19:48.657\nI've already said it once before, but\nit's like it's all behind the scenes.\n\n359\n00:19:48.657 --> 00:19:51.877\nJust make sure you understand what\nyour company does to your stuff.\n\n360\n00:19:51.877 --> 00:19:52.700\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n361\n00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.010\nAll right.\n&gt;&gt; But you don't get scared.\n\n362\n00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:55.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay sorry okay now I'm good.\n\n363\n00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:56.935\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Now she is gonna let me close the show.\n\n364\n00:19:56.935 --> 00:19:58.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Vonne for\n\n365\n00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.885\nallowing me to run my own show.\n\n366\n00:19:59.885 --> 00:20:01.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now it's been a lot of fun she is got\n\n367\n00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.360\ngreat information listen to her because\nwhat she is saying is good for you.\n\n368\n00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.080\nNow that being said we are out of time for\nthis episode we do thank for\n\n369\n00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.900\nwatching and joining us but\nwe're gonna call it a day.\n\n370\n00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.700\nSigning off for officeprotv I've\nbeen your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n371\n00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:14.300\n&gt;&gt;

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:18.581\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\nin today's episodes,\n\n4\n00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:21.949\nwe're getting deeper into\nthe Outlook on the web woods.\n\n5\n00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.976\nI took a chance and I actually made it.\n\n6\n00:00:23.976 --> 00:00:27.560\nSpecifically, we're looking at sharing and\nmanaging mailboxes.\n\n7\n00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.546\nThis is right up my ally because I\ndon't particularly like managing or\n\n8\n00:00:31.546 --> 00:00:33.475\ndoing anything with my mailbox.\n\n9\n00:00:33.475 --> 00:00:37.310\nBut I don't know how to do it, so\nluckily, we have the one and only Ms.\n\n10\n00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.536\nVaughn Smith here to help us, show us,\nguide us, be our guide, so to speak.\n\n11\n00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:42.620\n&gt;&gt; Be our guest.\n\n12\n00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.839\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, be our guest.\n\n13\n00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.935\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking of all sorts of\nDisney movie references right now.\n\n14\n00:00:46.935 --> 00:00:49.639\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we'll go with be our guide,\n\n15\n00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:53.940\nbe our guest, you are our yogi,\nI guess of Outlook.\n\n16\n00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.547\n&gt;&gt; Well wow, that's a pretty\nmagnificent title right there.\n\n17\n00:00:57.547 --> 00:00:58.311\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n18\n00:00:58.311 --> 00:00:59.622\n&gt;&gt; I'm a little scared right now.\n\n19\n00:00:59.622 --> 00:01:04.448\n[LAUGH] But yes,\nthis whole web of trying to figure out how\n\n20\n00:01:04.448 --> 00:01:08.146\nto get permission to share mailboxes, and\n\n21\n00:01:08.146 --> 00:01:13.600\nthen manage other people mail,\nother people's mailboxes.\n\n22\n00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.994\nWow, that is a mouthful, right?\n\n23\n00:01:14.994 --> 00:01:20.124\nIt's a little confusing when we get\ninto our Outlook on the web and\n\n24\n00:01:20.124 --> 00:01:25.066\nwhat you can and can't do at this\nparticular level as an end user\n\n25\n00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:30.302\nversus how that translates into\nOutlook as a local installation.\n\n26\n00:01:30.302 --> 00:01:33.884\nNow, of course, we do have the show\nOutlook on the web to where you're\n\n27\n00:01:33.884 --> 00:01:37.270\nthinking, well,\nI don't ever have a local version of it.\n\n28\n00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.220\nBut I have been doing\na lot of comparing and\n\n29\n00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.401\ncontrasting of these different\nproducts as we go through because,\n\n30\n00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:44.937\nyou might be somebody that\ndoes use both interfaces.\n\n31\n00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:47.883\nMainly, when you're at your\ndesk you're gonna go ahead and\n\n32\n00:01:47.883 --> 00:01:50.482\nuse the local installation,\nbut when you're away,\n\n33\n00:01:50.482 --> 00:01:53.099\nyou're going to have to use\nyour Outlook for the web.\n\n34\n00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:58.182\nAnd this is one of the areas where, if\nyou are managing somebody else's account,\n\n35\n00:01:58.182 --> 00:02:02.751\nyou gotta make sure that your Outlook\non the web is configured properly for\n\n36\n00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:07.480\nyou to be able to do the same thing\nthat you can do in a local insulation.\n\n37\n00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.386\nSo it gets a little confusing.\n\n38\n00:02:08.386 --> 00:02:11.835\nSo yeah, this is going to be one of\nthose episodes where we're gonna have\n\n39\n00:02:11.835 --> 00:02:13.200\nto remember what path we on.\n\n40\n00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.825\nI'm gonna have to remember what person,\nwhat I am, am I Just, am I Joey,\n\n41\n00:02:16.825 --> 00:02:17.418\nam I Lance?\n\n42\n00:02:17.418 --> 00:02:18.948\nBecause we're gonna be bouncing back and\n\n43\n00:02:18.948 --> 00:02:20.747\nforth with a couple\ndifferent demonstrations.\n\n44\n00:02:20.747 --> 00:02:26.440\nSo I really wanna kinda show you all the\ndifferent intricacies of all these levels.\n\n45\n00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.269\nSo you have a good understanding of\nwhat you need to do, to go ahead and\n\n46\n00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.925\nget all this setup properly.\n\n47\n00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:36.028\n&gt;&gt; So Vaughn, just to make sure I\nunderstand, there's enough of a divergence\n\n48\n00:02:36.028 --> 00:02:40.222\nbetween how these things work but I look\non the web and I look to installation.\n\n49\n00:02:40.222 --> 00:02:44.363\nThat is probably get to see this in\nthe context of each other just in order\n\n50\n00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:45.122\nto get okay,\n\n51\n00:02:45.122 --> 00:02:49.416\nI can do this if I want to do this that's\nnot available and I look on the web.\n\n52\n00:02:49.416 --> 00:02:51.631\nThis is one of those\ndecision making points so\n\n53\n00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:56.090\nyou can't really fuse those apart,\na lot of times in our previous episodes.\n\n54\n00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.855\nThey're close enough that we can go,\n\n55\n00:02:57.855 --> 00:03:00.018\nhere's the little bit\nof nuance difference.\n\n56\n00:03:00.018 --> 00:03:04.507\nThis is a large enough difference my\nunderstanding that it requires a treatment\n\n57\n00:03:04.507 --> 00:03:06.414\nof both in order to compare them.\n\n58\n00:03:06.414 --> 00:03:07.118\n&gt;&gt; Definitely and\n\n59\n00:03:07.118 --> 00:03:10.750\nespecially when you're going to be talking\nabout that level of what we're at.\n\n60\n00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.412\nWe're talking about,\nyou as a boss and I'm you assistant.\n\n61\n00:03:15.412 --> 00:03:18.260\nI need to be able to control your mailbox.\n\n62\n00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.075\nI need to answer mail on your behalf.\n\n63\n00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.598\nI need to go ahead and\nsend those things out, and\n\n64\n00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:26.320\nthat's where you need to make sure\nthat you understand what levels and\n\n65\n00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.248\nwho you need to talk to,\nalso to get this taken care of.\n\n66\n00:03:29.248 --> 00:03:29.950\nSo why don’t we jump down.\n\n67\n00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.630\nI have a PowerPoint\npresentation to get us started.\n\n68\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.139\nJust to kinda get familiar with all of\nthese different things that we're going to\n\n69\n00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.740\nbe weaving our way through.\n\n70\n00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.082\nSo sharing versus delegating\nthe local legislation versus\n\n71\n00:03:43.082 --> 00:03:45.900\nthe online legislation of Outlook.\n\n72\n00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.108\nAnd then send as, and then send on behalf.\n\n73\n00:03:49.108 --> 00:03:50.540\nThose are two different things.\n\n74\n00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.998\nAnd this is the end just like an overview.\n\n75\n00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:57.770\nSo, right here, just because you share\na folder with somebody does not mean\n\n76\n00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.660\nthat you're actually delegating\nthem to act on your behalf.\n\n77\n00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.250\nAnd so that's the biggest difference\nright here, sharing folders.\n\n78\n00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.448\nSo folder sharing lets other\npeople access one or more folders.\n\n79\n00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:12.540\nHowever, it does not include permissions\nfor them to act on your behalf.\n\n80\n00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.286\nThat's a big, big key right there\nthat I think trips everybody up.\n\n81\n00:04:16.286 --> 00:04:18.758\nWell, I went ahead and\nshared my mailbox with you.\n\n82\n00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.880\nYou should be able to do everything.\n\n83\n00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.001\nNo, it doesn't work that way.\n\n84\n00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:23.440\nYou have to delegate.\n\n85\n00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.904\nYou have to actually do this whole\ndelegate access pf where you're giving\n\n86\n00:04:27.904 --> 00:04:28.775\npermission.\n\n87\n00:04:28.775 --> 00:04:32.485\nThere’s another kinda trick because you're\nactually changing the permissions on\n\n88\n00:04:32.485 --> 00:04:33.330\na folder to share.\n\n89\n00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.457\nBut then, you're gonna talk about\npermissions to act on your behalf.\n\n90\n00:04:36.457 --> 00:04:39.980\nNo, you're delegating access,\nthat's the biggest key right there.\n\n91\n00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.940\nAnd so it says you have an assistance,\nyou wanna go ahead and create meetings,\n\n92\n00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.785\nblah blah blah.\n\n93\n00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:49.300\nAll that kinda fun stuff, so\nyou're going to have to delegate access.\n\n94\n00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.588\nIn this web link right there.\n\n95\n00:04:50.588 --> 00:04:52.261\nIt's in our show notes.\n\n96\n00:04:52.261 --> 00:04:54.236\nIt's actually a really good website for\n\n97\n00:04:54.236 --> 00:04:57.149\nsome resources on how you actually\ndo this at a local level.\n\n98\n00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:59.980\nSo, why don't we kinda\nmove on to our next slide.\n\n99\n00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.536\nIf you're going to be sharing a folder\nlike I wanna share my inbox with you.\n\n100\n00:05:04.536 --> 00:05:08.486\nI can either set that at the local\ninstallation of Outlook or\n\n101\n00:05:08.486 --> 00:05:12.015\non the online version of\nyour account of Outlook.\n\n102\n00:05:12.015 --> 00:05:14.852\nAnd it's going to be\nthe same in either one.\n\n103\n00:05:14.852 --> 00:05:16.585\nSo you do it at your local level.\n\n104\n00:05:16.585 --> 00:05:20.675\nYou go into your online access,\nyou'll see the same share information.\n\n105\n00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:27.370\nSo that, we'll go ahead and kind of\ntranspose from one version of the other.\n\n106\n00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.898\nBut delegating,\ndelegating access to somebody else for\n\n107\n00:05:32.898 --> 00:05:39.015\nyour account, you can do that at\nthe local level as an end user.\n\n108\n00:05:39.015 --> 00:05:43.304\nPretty much you can figure everything\non their own so you can go ahead and\n\n109\n00:05:43.304 --> 00:05:48.780\nset this up without ever really talking\nto your IT person most of the time, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.548\nAnd that's where you can be\nable to send email on behalf,\n\n111\n00:05:52.548 --> 00:05:56.562\nand that actually is gonna show\nup in the title of your email.\n\n112\n00:05:56.562 --> 00:05:59.936\nAnd maybe you are in an organization\nwhere you've already seen that,\n\n113\n00:05:59.936 --> 00:06:02.979\nwhere you've seen Lance Bass on\nbehalf of Justin Timberlake.\n\n114\n00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:07.793\nSo you know that Lance is speaking on\nbehalf of Justin, and so that way one acts\n\n115\n00:06:07.793 --> 00:06:12.407\nas the assistant, and Justin is the boss,\nand you can actually see that.\n\n116\n00:06:12.407 --> 00:06:14.467\nYou can set that to local level,\n\n117\n00:06:14.467 --> 00:06:18.750\nbut say you are somebody that is\nmanaging that person's account.\n\n118\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.155\nYou go to your online version, and\nyou don't have that same delegation power,\n\n119\n00:06:23.155 --> 00:06:24.218\nif you want to say.\n\n120\n00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:27.884\nThat’s because the only\nway that you can have your\n\n121\n00:06:27.884 --> 00:06:32.334\nOutlook on the web be able to\nact on somebody else's behalf,\n\n122\n00:06:32.334 --> 00:06:36.990\nto have that delegation,\nyou have to do it at the admin level.\n\n123\n00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:43.414\nSo you would have to contact your IT guy\nor girl and be able to set that there.\n\n124\n00:06:43.414 --> 00:06:48.085\nNow, I am gonna go through those steps\nat the end of this episode because, hey,\n\n125\n00:06:48.085 --> 00:06:51.840\nmaybe you're a small organization and\nyou are the IT person.\n\n126\n00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.915\nYou are the one that has\ncontrol over that account and\n\n127\n00:06:53.915 --> 00:06:55.247\nyou need to be able to set that up.\n\n128\n00:06:55.247 --> 00:06:57.002\nIt's actually not too difficult.\n\n129\n00:06:57.002 --> 00:06:58.060\nIt really isn't.\n\n130\n00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.896\nJust follow a couple of steps, and\nI'll be able to show you that so\n\n131\n00:07:00.896 --> 00:07:02.507\nthat's the one thing you need to do.\n\n132\n00:07:02.507 --> 00:07:07.560\nNow, the next slide that I want to show\nyou is the send as, versus send on behalf.\n\n133\n00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.286\nAnd again, we'll see these in a little bit\nthat at the top, where it's sending on\n\n134\n00:07:12.286 --> 00:07:16.600\nbehalf, if you don't want that to show,\nlet's say I am your assistant and\n\n135\n00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.213\nI need to be able send emails from your\naccount that looks like its actually you.\n\n136\n00:07:21.213 --> 00:07:22.975\nAnd there is no middlemen in there,\n\n137\n00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:26.500\nit just look like its you even\non the way behind the keyboard.\n\n138\n00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.899\n&gt;&gt; Well that makes sense.\n\n139\n00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:32.638\nHow else would I frame all my productivity\nif I had on behalf of Justin.\n\n140\n00:07:32.638 --> 00:07:36.891\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, I want it to be just my name but\n\n141\n00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:38.859\nI want you to take care of it.\n\n142\n00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:41.449\n&gt;&gt; Exactly so\nthat would be doing a send as, and\n\n143\n00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:44.110\nthat you have to talk\nto your administrator.\n\n144\n00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.935\nIt doesn't matter if it's on\nthe local level or the online level,\n\n145\n00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:49.927\nyou've got to talk to your admin.\n\n146\n00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:51.550\nSo guess what?\n\n147\n00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:52.964\nIt's Ronnie!\n\n148\n00:07:52.964 --> 00:07:55.075\nThere's Ronnie here to save the day.\n\n149\n00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:57.428\nAnd yes, he's in glowing pink because.\n\n150\n00:07:57.428 --> 00:08:01.356\nHe is the Outlook or Office 365 admin.\n\n151\n00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:05.431\nHe's the one I go to to say, hey,\nwe're at that next level up and\n\n152\n00:08:05.431 --> 00:08:08.771\nthen he goes and saves the day,\nlike he always does.\n\n153\n00:08:08.771 --> 00:08:12.174\nI mean, the guy has his own T shirt,\nit's a pretty awesome T shirt.\n\n154\n00:08:12.174 --> 00:08:12.993\nSo [LAUGH].\n\n155\n00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:15.632\nSo that's who you would have to talk to.\n\n156\n00:08:15.632 --> 00:08:20.639\nSo now, what I'd like to do is go\nthrough all the different types\n\n157\n00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:25.388\nof scenarios that you have with\nsharing versus delegating.\n\n158\n00:08:25.388 --> 00:08:28.612\nSo we're gonna start with Joey, and\n\n159\n00:08:28.612 --> 00:08:32.991\nhe is going to share his inbox with JT,\nall right?\n\n160\n00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.102\nSo again, we're gonna try and\ndo different demos.\n\n161\n00:08:36.102 --> 00:08:40.058\nThis is demo one,\nJoey shares inbox with JT.\n\n162\n00:08:40.058 --> 00:08:46.812\nSo at the Joey level, Joey has to change\nthe folder permissions for JT to access.\n\n163\n00:08:46.812 --> 00:08:50.007\nSo what you'd have to do is,\nover here on your folder panel,\n\n164\n00:08:50.007 --> 00:08:54.032\nyou go to the folder that you want to\nshare which, in this case is your Inbox.\n\n165\n00:08:54.032 --> 00:08:56.940\nAnd you go down to the bottom\nwhere it says Permissions.\n\n166\n00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.752\nIn the local installation,\nI believe it's the properties.\n\n167\n00:08:58.752 --> 00:09:00.451\nYou right click and go to properties.\n\n168\n00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:02.995\nSo I'm gonna go to Permissions.\n\n169\n00:09:02.995 --> 00:09:05.601\nAnd then none of this\nwould normally be here.\n\n170\n00:09:05.601 --> 00:09:09.283\nI've already set this all up because\nany time you're gonna start doing\n\n171\n00:09:09.283 --> 00:09:10.143\npermissions and\n\n172\n00:09:10.143 --> 00:09:14.391\nsharing and all of these different things\nthat's kind of changing your account.\n\n173\n00:09:14.391 --> 00:09:17.516\nThis is a cloud based\nsystem in Office 365.\n\n174\n00:09:17.516 --> 00:09:21.954\nSo you're gonna have to let it,\nit's kind of like letting it breathe.\n\n175\n00:09:21.954 --> 00:09:24.561\nI know Justin, you deal with this in\nthe development world all the time.\n\n176\n00:09:24.561 --> 00:09:27.601\nYou change something, you got to kinda\nlike walk away for a couple hours, right?\n\n177\n00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:30.812\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sometimes it has to propagate\nthrough the system in order for\n\n178\n00:09:30.812 --> 00:09:34.246\neverything, all these changes to take\neffect and this is kind of part for\n\n179\n00:09:34.246 --> 00:09:36.073\nthe course for some admin level task.\n\n180\n00:09:36.073 --> 00:09:39.732\nSo, maybe you're intermittently\noffline and you have to wait for\n\n181\n00:09:39.732 --> 00:09:44.043\nyour local installation to get online in\norder to find out that the permissions\n\n182\n00:09:44.043 --> 00:09:45.171\nhave been changed.\n\n183\n00:09:45.171 --> 00:09:51.000\nSo sometimes just being patient will\nactually get you a lot further than going,\n\n184\n00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.574\nwhy don't you work?\n\n185\n00:09:52.574 --> 00:09:54.006\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't understand.\n\n186\n00:09:54.006 --> 00:09:56.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and-\n&gt;&gt; So we have to let it breathe.\n\n187\n00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.346\n&gt;&gt; And we all do that anyway, right?\n\n188\n00:09:57.346 --> 00:09:58.892\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I even let you breathe, right?\n\n189\n00:09:58.892 --> 00:10:00.333\nI was like, jump right in, go, go, go.\n\n190\n00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:03.129\nYes, so that's one of those\nthings that I went ahead and\n\n191\n00:10:03.129 --> 00:10:05.282\nset all this up before\nwe did this episode.\n\n192\n00:10:05.282 --> 00:10:07.571\nThat way we could go ahead and\nI could just show you.\n\n193\n00:10:07.571 --> 00:10:13.152\nSo what you would need to do is as Joey,\nhe needs to get permission of his inbox or\n\n194\n00:10:13.152 --> 00:10:16.464\nJustin Timberlake, and that's right here.\n\n195\n00:10:16.464 --> 00:10:18.311\nAnd the biggest thing\nI can say right here.\n\n196\n00:10:18.311 --> 00:10:22.765\nWhen you're going to give access to\nsomebody else on your mail boxer whatever\n\n197\n00:10:22.765 --> 00:10:25.709\nfolder, do not do it on\na default cuz people come and\n\n198\n00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:27.161\nI have done it [LAUGH] too.\n\n199\n00:10:27.161 --> 00:10:30.412\nYou come down here and let me go ahead and\nchange permission level and\n\n200\n00:10:30.412 --> 00:10:33.252\nyou're doing it on a default,\nyou don't want that to happen.\n\n201\n00:10:33.252 --> 00:10:38.387\nYou need to make sure you are specifying\na user to have that access,\n\n202\n00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:41.974\nso you'd have to put that\nplus sign at the top.\n\n203\n00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:47.923\nAdd the person in and then make sure you\nare selected on that particular person and\n\n204\n00:10:47.923 --> 00:10:50.562\nthen change the permission level.\n\n205\n00:10:50.562 --> 00:10:54.632\nBig bold asterisk right\nthere make sure you do that.\n\n206\n00:10:54.632 --> 00:10:57.024\nAnd so\nyou can see that Justin is an owner.\n\n207\n00:10:57.024 --> 00:11:00.204\nAnd there are different\npredetermined access levels or\n\n208\n00:11:00.204 --> 00:11:04.543\npermission levels that you can do to\nwhere somebody's just a contributor.\n\n209\n00:11:04.543 --> 00:11:08.642\nSee, they don't have make necessarily\nthe option to edit certain things.\n\n210\n00:11:08.642 --> 00:11:14.171\nBut if you go to an Author versus\nEditor and you can see that there.\n\n211\n00:11:14.171 --> 00:11:17.521\nDo they have permission\nto read full details?\n\n212\n00:11:17.521 --> 00:11:21.153\nWhat type of folder access do they have?\n\n213\n00:11:21.153 --> 00:11:24.300\nCan they create their own sub folders?\n\n214\n00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.985\nHow much stuff really,\ncan they do what level?\n\n215\n00:11:28.985 --> 00:11:33.330\nNow these are all predetermine but\nyou can go back and reconfigure them.\n\n216\n00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:37.272\nYou can start with an Owner and\nthen turn some of them on and off and\n\n217\n00:11:37.272 --> 00:11:39.842\nto make the custom level of permissions.\n\n218\n00:11:39.842 --> 00:11:44.687\nBut for now I'm just gonna say\nJustin Timberlake will be the owner of\n\n219\n00:11:44.687 --> 00:11:46.731\nJoey's inbox right there.\n\n220\n00:11:46.731 --> 00:11:48.558\nAnd so that's what you say, you click OK.\n\n221\n00:11:48.558 --> 00:11:51.737\nI'm just gonna click Cancel at this\npoint because I've already got it set.\n\n222\n00:11:51.737 --> 00:11:56.860\nAnd so now Joey has shared with JT.\n\n223\n00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.881\nPerfect, so\nnow let's come over to JTs account.\n\n224\n00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:04.300\nOn JTs level, now this is somebody that\nhey somebody shared a folder with me.\n\n225\n00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:10.712\nNow, how do I add that person's folder for\nme to be able to view their content.\n\n226\n00:12:10.712 --> 00:12:15.173\nYou go up onto the main account level\nright here on the Justin Timberlake.\n\n227\n00:12:15.173 --> 00:12:16.828\nSo that's your account name.\n\n228\n00:12:16.828 --> 00:12:21.608\nYou right click and\nyou want to do the Add shared folder.\n\n229\n00:12:21.608 --> 00:12:23.885\nAnd when you click Add shared folder,\nthen you go ahead and\n\n230\n00:12:23.885 --> 00:12:25.734\nput the person's name\nthat you want in there.\n\n231\n00:12:25.734 --> 00:12:28.518\nI'm gonna go ahead and Cancel that\nbecause I've already done that,\n\n232\n00:12:28.518 --> 00:12:29.867\ncuz if I scroll down a little bit.\n\n233\n00:12:29.867 --> 00:12:33.759\nThere is, Joey Fatone and\nif I click the Inbox underneath and\n\n234\n00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:35.297\nit might be collapsed.\n\n235\n00:12:35.297 --> 00:12:38.034\nSo you might have to expand this up.\n\n236\n00:12:38.034 --> 00:12:46.973\nThis is Joey Fatone inbox as me Justin\nTimberlake because it's a shared folder.\n\n237\n00:12:46.973 --> 00:12:48.720\nThat's all I can view.\n\n238\n00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.666\nRemember that's the whole\nthing about sharing and\n\n239\n00:12:50.666 --> 00:12:52.555\ndelegating two different things.\n\n240\n00:12:52.555 --> 00:12:54.008\nIt's a shared folder.\n\n241\n00:12:54.008 --> 00:13:00.329\nSo I can open the mail but\nI can't respond for Joey.\n\n242\n00:13:00.329 --> 00:13:02.347\nJT cannot send an email from it.\n\n243\n00:13:02.347 --> 00:13:03.508\nAnd I'll just show you really quickly.\n\n244\n00:13:03.508 --> 00:13:07.846\nIf I show you, new,\nlet me go ahead and pop this out.\n\n245\n00:13:07.846 --> 00:13:11.879\nCuz in our other show, we talked about\nwhen you're sending from other accounts,\n\n246\n00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:13.407\nyou always use the from field.\n\n247\n00:13:13.407 --> 00:13:16.201\nSo you do the show from and\nyou can drop this down and choose.\n\n248\n00:13:16.201 --> 00:13:20.959\nYou'll never be able to choose another\nperson this way at this particular\n\n249\n00:13:20.959 --> 00:13:23.962\nlevel because it just\ndoesn't work that way.\n\n250\n00:13:23.962 --> 00:13:28.882\nSharing is a view only type\nof thing that you can do.\n\n251\n00:13:28.882 --> 00:13:32.390\nNow just to kind of preface what we're\ngonna do later cuz you might see some\n\n252\n00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:35.852\ntutorials where it's like,\nI'll just open another person's inbox.\n\n253\n00:13:35.852 --> 00:13:39.027\nSo if you go over here to\nthe right hand side and\n\n254\n00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:44.892\nthen go to Open another mailbox thinking,\nI have shared permissions, I'm fine.\n\n255\n00:13:44.892 --> 00:13:49.600\nI type in Joey, and\nthen we click Open, it's like,\n\n256\n00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:55.383\nnope can't do that because you\ndon't have delegation access.\n\n257\n00:13:55.383 --> 00:13:58.872\nIt's only a shared folder, so that's\nwhere it says, why isn't it working?\n\n258\n00:13:58.872 --> 00:14:01.481\nIt’s because you didn't have\nthe right steps, all right.\n\n259\n00:14:01.481 --> 00:14:05.597\nSo, that is going to be the end\nof our demo one of sharing and\n\n260\n00:14:05.597 --> 00:14:10.052\nthe online level, cuz that not\nmight be the only what you need.\n\n261\n00:14:10.052 --> 00:14:13.644\nYou just need to see it you just right,\nyou just need to monitor, right?\n\n262\n00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:15.535\nMaybe I just need to\nmonitor what you're doing.\n\n263\n00:14:15.535 --> 00:14:17.612\nI don't actually have\nto act on your behalf.\n\n264\n00:14:17.612 --> 00:14:20.020\n&gt;&gt; So I think I got this.\n\n265\n00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.883\nSo sharing is like\nloaning someone your car.\n\n266\n00:14:22.883 --> 00:14:25.813\nBut then delegating is\ngiving them approval\n\n267\n00:14:25.813 --> 00:14:29.702\nto maybe repaint your car bright\npurple if they so choose.\n\n268\n00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:32.325\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like a pretty\ngood analogy there.\n\n269\n00:14:32.325 --> 00:14:35.090\nAnd I wouldn't mind if you painted\nmine purple, I love purple.\n\n270\n00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:39.363\n&gt;&gt; Well, now that we've seen how to share,\nhow does this delegation come back?\n\n271\n00:14:39.363 --> 00:14:43.807\nCuz remember back to the PowerPoint\nthat we saw earlier in the episode,\n\n272\n00:14:43.807 --> 00:14:46.334\ndelegation was a little bit different.\n\n273\n00:14:46.334 --> 00:14:50.831\nThere were some nuances or idiosyncracies\nthat we had to be very careful of, right?\n\n274\n00:14:50.831 --> 00:14:53.823\n&gt;&gt; You paid attention to the PowerPoint,\nI'm so proud [LAUGH].\n\n275\n00:14:53.823 --> 00:14:56.170\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to learn here Vonne,\nI'm trying to learn.\n\n276\n00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.091\n&gt;&gt; Well, let me show you.\n\n277\n00:14:57.091 --> 00:14:59.852\nSo why don't we come\nover here to demo two.\n\n278\n00:14:59.852 --> 00:15:04.220\nDemo two is going to be, we're gonna\nlook at some of the local settings and\n\n279\n00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.902\nhow that differs from\nyour online settings.\n\n280\n00:15:06.902 --> 00:15:08.242\nSo I'm back here at Joey.\n\n281\n00:15:08.242 --> 00:15:11.423\nSo in this demo two,\nnow you've got to keep me on track here.\n\n282\n00:15:11.423 --> 00:15:15.661\nJoey is delegating to Lance,\non the local level.\n\n283\n00:15:15.661 --> 00:15:18.231\nSo let's go over here to\nthe local installation of Outlook.\n\n284\n00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:22.132\nAnd again, I'm not gonna go in detail\nof this because it is in another show.\n\n285\n00:15:22.132 --> 00:15:25.002\nBut just to show you that\nthis is delegated access,\n\n286\n00:15:25.002 --> 00:15:27.152\ngiving permission to somebody else.\n\n287\n00:15:27.152 --> 00:15:32.557\nAnd then you can see that Joey\nhas delegated to Lance that\n\n288\n00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:37.853\nhe has permission to,\ndrum roll please, there it is.\n\n289\n00:15:37.853 --> 00:15:42.497\nThat he can go ahead and read, create,\nand modify Inbox items, Tasks,\n\n290\n00:15:42.497 --> 00:15:44.567\nCalender, the whole shebang.\n\n291\n00:15:44.567 --> 00:15:47.791\nOkay, so we’ve got that going on and\n\n292\n00:15:47.791 --> 00:15:53.313\nthe Joey side because Joey has\nto set that level of delegation.\n\n293\n00:15:53.313 --> 00:15:55.627\nNow, the receiver would be Lance, and\n\n294\n00:15:55.627 --> 00:15:59.650\nit looks like I did not turn on my\nvirtual machine before we started.\n\n295\n00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:03.331\nBut you know what, guess what, I hope they\ngive us, I was hoping for the cute foxes.\n\n296\n00:16:03.331 --> 00:16:04.476\nI really like those cute foxes.\n\n297\n00:16:04.476 --> 00:16:07.120\n&gt;&gt; I do enjoy those cute foxes.\n\n298\n00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.890\nThey make me warm and fuzzy inside.\n\n299\n00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:12.980\nOf course,\nthat sunset photo is pretty nice as well.\n\n300\n00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.754\n&gt;&gt; It is, and there we go, yay,\nI got my password down the second try.\n\n301\n00:16:15.754 --> 00:16:18.097\n[LAUGH] Or was that the third?\n\n302\n00:16:18.097 --> 00:16:22.450\nYeah, [LAUGH] so now we're here at\nthe Lance level local, all right.\n\n303\n00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:26.986\nAnd now this is where he can go ahead,\nand Joey has delegated, so\n\n304\n00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:30.016\nyou can see that Joey can,\nI see the inbox.\n\n305\n00:16:30.016 --> 00:16:32.990\nAnd that's where you just go to\nopen somebody else's mailbox.\n\n306\n00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:38.811\nAnd I could go to the new mail, and\nnotice that I have in the front field,\n\n307\n00:16:38.811 --> 00:16:41.543\nI have the option to send as Joey.\n\n308\n00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:45.273\nPretend that JT, that's demo three,\n[LAUGH] that we get JT and\n\n309\n00:16:45.273 --> 00:16:47.025\nLance going on in here.\n\n310\n00:16:47.025 --> 00:16:54.310\nSo, Lance can send\nan email that's from Joey.\n\n311\n00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.190\nPerfect, okay,\nbecause Lance is Joey's assistant.\n\n312\n00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:57.881\nThat's the local level.\n\n313\n00:16:57.881 --> 00:17:01.160\nSo you're thinking, okay,\nthat's fantastic, right?\n\n314\n00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.561\nWell, guess what?\n\n315\n00:17:02.561 --> 00:17:05.015\nOn the online level, you can't do that.\n\n316\n00:17:05.015 --> 00:17:09.655\nOkay, if Lance goes ahead and\ntries to send, wait, okay, so, [LAUGH] at\n\n317\n00:17:09.655 --> 00:17:14.541\nthe local level, sorry, see this is\nwhere I'm getting confused already.\n\n318\n00:17:14.541 --> 00:17:18.537\nHe went ahead and sent it, so\nlet's go ahead and pretend that I didn't\n\n319\n00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:22.360\nsay anything else after that, so\ncan you stay with me for a second?\n\n320\n00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.578\nComing back over here to JT,\nall right, JT,\n\n321\n00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:31.240\nI wanted to show you what\nhe sees as the recipient of\n\n322\n00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.358\nan email from Lance as Joey,\nso there we go.\n\n323\n00:17:35.358 --> 00:17:38.148\nSo you can see that this is JT now,\n\n324\n00:17:38.148 --> 00:17:43.310\nis getting an email from Lance\non behalf of Joey Fatone.\n\n325\n00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:48.258\nSo this is something that you\nsee a lot of, where it's like,\n\n326\n00:17:48.258 --> 00:17:53.999\nyou need to have the person know that\nit is from Lance, the assistant.\n\n327\n00:17:53.999 --> 00:17:57.520\nAnd he's speaking on behalf of Joey.\n\n328\n00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.590\nJoey is the boss.\n\n329\n00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.730\nAnd this is something I would see\na lot at the university level because\n\n330\n00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:06.860\nthe administrative assistant was emailing\non behalf of that particular director.\n\n331\n00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.690\nAnd at that level,\nit's like okay, that's great.\n\n332\n00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:15.451\nSometimes you need to be able to see\nit that way cuz you don't want people\n\n333\n00:18:15.451 --> 00:18:19.822\nthinking it's really Joey when Lance\nis the one typing, that kind of stuff.\n\n334\n00:18:19.822 --> 00:18:23.002\nSo if you wanna keep it this level,\nthat's totally fine.\n\n335\n00:18:23.002 --> 00:18:25.907\nBut if you want it to be\nfrom that particular person,\n\n336\n00:18:25.907 --> 00:18:30.010\nwhere you don't see any of the on behalf,\nthat's something different.\n\n337\n00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:33.270\nThat's that whole send on behalf and\nsend as.\n\n338\n00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:38.350\nAnd that's the admin level, which I\nwill show you in just a little bit.\n\n339\n00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.410\nBut that's just where we are right now.\n\n340\n00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:50.640\nComing back over here to Lance, wanted\nto go ahead and sign into my account.\n\n341\n00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.309\nFirst of all, because remember,\nthe local version,\n\n342\n00:18:54.309 --> 00:18:58.957\nLance would go ahead and do the front\nfield and everything like that.\n\n343\n00:18:58.957 --> 00:19:03.457\nIt does not translate for\nLance as the assistant\n\n344\n00:19:03.457 --> 00:19:07.855\nto email on behalf from\nthe Outlook on the web.\n\n345\n00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:10.742\nBut all the settings are on the local,\nI do it all the time because\n\n346\n00:19:10.742 --> 00:19:13.757\nI'm at the office, I'm at the desk,\nI could go ahead and do that.\n\n347\n00:19:13.757 --> 00:19:15.204\nYou can't, all right?\n\n348\n00:19:15.204 --> 00:19:22.440\nYou cannot come over here to Lance,\nand open up the other mailbox.\n\n349\n00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.735\nSorry, it's catching up with itself.\n\n350\n00:19:23.735 --> 00:19:27.510\nThere we go, we go over here,\nopen another mailbox.\n\n351\n00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:31.340\nAnd if I type in Joey and click there,\n\n352\n00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:35.796\nit's gonna say nope, you can't, okay?\n\n353\n00:19:35.796 --> 00:19:42.080\nThere is that example of local,\neverything's great, online, can't happen.\n\n354\n00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.880\nThe only place you can do that is\nin the administration settings.\n\n355\n00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.630\nSo, that's where I'm gonna get\ninto demo three, all right?\n\n356\n00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:53.502\nAre we all still with me?\n\n357\n00:19:53.502 --> 00:19:56.230\nI got a little off track there for\na little bit there, Justin.\n\n358\n00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:59.650\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, there are a lot\nof identities to manage here.\n\n359\n00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:02.970\nAnd I'm super proud of you that you\nhaven't had an identity crisis up\n\n360\n00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.250\nuntil this point.\n\n361\n00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:08.780\nBut now that we've seen that these don't\nsync, I'm kinda interested, if I'm\n\n362\n00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:13.610\njust an Outlook on the web user, how do\nI actually make that come to fruition?\n\n363\n00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:17.487\nIs that something that I can do,\nor am I totally off base here?\n\n364\n00:20:17.487 --> 00:20:19.108\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nyou're talking about access, right?\n\n365\n00:20:19.108 --> 00:20:23.021\n[LAUGH] It depends on if you have\nadministrative privileges on your own\n\n366\n00:20:23.021 --> 00:20:23.631\naccount.\n\n367\n00:20:23.631 --> 00:20:28.318\nNow this is something that\nyou might not be able to do\n\n368\n00:20:28.318 --> 00:20:33.448\nbecause you aren't\nan administrator of your account.\n\n369\n00:20:33.448 --> 00:20:35.848\nBut it's me, I can control my account.\n\n370\n00:20:35.848 --> 00:20:37.627\nWell, let me show you, okay?\n\n371\n00:20:37.627 --> 00:20:39.473\nSo right over here, do you see?\n\n372\n00:20:39.473 --> 00:20:40.220\nThis is Lance.\n\n373\n00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.550\nDo you see that there's no button\nin here that says admin, is there?\n\n374\n00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.060\nOkay, just double checking, right?\n\n375\n00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.740\nNo, there's no admin, okay?\n\n376\n00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.538\nLance can't control his own account.\n\n377\n00:20:50.538 --> 00:20:56.160\nWell, it's really Ronnie, [LAUGH] but\nlet's come over here to JT.\n\n378\n00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.763\nRemember, we're all on\nOffice pro demo code, right?\n\n379\n00:20:58.763 --> 00:21:01.616\nJT has an admin button.\n\n380\n00:21:01.616 --> 00:21:05.490\nHe's the only one that has admin level.\n\n381\n00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:09.194\nIt's one of those,\nlike Justin is the one who went ahead and\n\n382\n00:21:09.194 --> 00:21:11.862\npurchased the subscription, the E5, or\n\n383\n00:21:11.862 --> 00:21:15.216\nthe Enterprise level subscription for\nthe company.\n\n384\n00:21:15.216 --> 00:21:18.721\nSo Justin would be the only\none that had accessed this.\n\n385\n00:21:18.721 --> 00:21:20.004\nOr in this case, Ronnie, right?\n\n386\n00:21:20.004 --> 00:21:23.428\nRonnie is the one who goes ahead and\ndoes this.\n\n387\n00:21:23.428 --> 00:21:28.604\nSo let me just show you, if you ever\nhave to do this as somebody controlling\n\n388\n00:21:28.604 --> 00:21:34.130\nthe administrative part of your accounts,\nyou would need to have this set up.\n\n389\n00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:39.767\nSo you go over here to your admin, then\nyou scroll on down to your Admin centers.\n\n390\n00:21:39.767 --> 00:21:45.079\nAnd then Admin centers, scroll down a\nlittle bit more, you're going to Exchange.\n\n391\n00:21:45.079 --> 00:21:49.237\nActually, you and I talked about this when\nwe were doing our terminology of what is\n\n392\n00:21:49.237 --> 00:21:53.390\na POP3, what is a server,\nwhat's Exchange, all that kind of stuff.\n\n393\n00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:59.320\nSo you would come into\nthe Exchange Admin Center.\n\n394\n00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:04.690\nAnd it is thinking, wow, I've never\nseen that type of circle going there.\n\n395\n00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.403\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne,\nthat's the fun time with crowd services,\n\n396\n00:22:07.403 --> 00:22:10.067\nsometimes you get that\nlittle bit of spinny-roos.\n\n397\n00:22:10.067 --> 00:22:12.360\nA lot of times, that's just redirects.\n\n398\n00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.101\nSo if you just wait it out, it'll work.\n\n399\n00:22:14.101 --> 00:22:16.879\nNow, however,\nI have had times where redirects,\n\n400\n00:22:16.879 --> 00:22:18.826\nthey're doing some weird things.\n\n401\n00:22:18.826 --> 00:22:21.611\nAnd probably the first thing I would\ntry is close out of my browser,\n\n402\n00:22:21.611 --> 00:22:24.270\ncome all the way back, and\nmaybe it was a hiccup in the browser.\n\n403\n00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:28.090\nBut luckily, it looks like yours actually\nresolved, and we're good to go now.\n\n404\n00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:32.955\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually while you were talking,\nI closed that tab, I did a refresh.\n\n405\n00:22:32.955 --> 00:22:37.900\nI just did a Ctrl+R or\nwhatever the keyboard shortcut is here.\n\n406\n00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.690\nI'm like, okay, and\nthen I tried it again, and it works.\n\n407\n00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:44.870\nSo yeah, the wonderful cloud computing,\nit happens sometimes.\n\n408\n00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:46.410\nSo just to recap, where are we?\n\n409\n00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.282\nWe were in the admin center.\n\n410\n00:22:48.282 --> 00:22:50.761\nSo we went from the admin center,\nExchange, and\n\n411\n00:22:50.761 --> 00:22:52.790\nit always opens up in more tabs.\n\n412\n00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:58.405\nSo from here, because what we're\ntrying to do is get that delegation at\n\n413\n00:22:58.405 --> 00:23:03.473\nthe web level as an admin, so\nwe come over here to the mailboxes.\n\n414\n00:23:03.473 --> 00:23:08.640\nAnd from mailbox, we go ahead and\nfind the person, the account.\n\n415\n00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.230\nBecause right now, remember, we're in the\nadmin of Office Pro demo code right now.\n\n416\n00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:13.670\nSo what are we doing?\n\n417\n00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:18.060\nSo I am showing you our\nthird demo right now,\n\n418\n00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.470\neven though we went from two,\nnow we're doing the third one.\n\n419\n00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:27.670\nTo where at the online version,\nwe want JT, okay, to delegate to Lance.\n\n420\n00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:33.902\nSo JT is the boss, and he's wanting\nLance to be his assistant, okay?\n\n421\n00:23:33.902 --> 00:23:37.340\nI know, we've been going back and\nforth on all these different people.\n\n422\n00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.900\nSo JT delegates to Lance.\n\n423\n00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.580\nSo we're gonna have to say,\nlet's go ahead to JT's account.\n\n424\n00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.146\nWe click on the little pencil right there.\n\n425\n00:23:45.146 --> 00:23:50.502\nAnd in this window,\nwe want to go to the mailbox delegation.\n\n426\n00:23:50.502 --> 00:23:52.472\nThat's exactly what we're doing.\n\n427\n00:23:52.472 --> 00:23:53.602\nAll right so what do we need to do?\n\n428\n00:23:53.602 --> 00:23:54.936\nThere's three different boxes.\n\n429\n00:23:54.936 --> 00:23:58.380\nI'm gonna start at the bottom one\nbecause look at what we have.\n\n430\n00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:03.250\nThe full access permissions allows\na delegate to open this mailbox, JT,\n\n431\n00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:09.260\nremember JT's the boss, and\nbehave as the mailbox owner.\n\n432\n00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:10.190\nThat's Lance.\n\n433\n00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.780\nSo that's where you get really confused,\nare we putting this on Lance or\n\n434\n00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:13.500\nare we putting this on JT?\n\n435\n00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.300\nNo.\nJT is the boss.\n\n436\n00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:19.900\nHe needs to have Lance be the delegate.\n\n437\n00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.860\nSo, that's where we get full access there.\n\n438\n00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:27.450\nNow, the other two, just to show you, this\nis that Send As and Send on Behalf, right?\n\n439\n00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:31.430\nWe saw the Send on Behalf\nwhere you see the middle man,\n\n440\n00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:34.390\nthe assistant acting\non behalf of the boss.\n\n441\n00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:38.223\nBut if you put that Lance can Send As,\n\n442\n00:24:38.223 --> 00:24:43.910\nwhat that's going to do is that\nLance will be behind the keyboard\n\n443\n00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:49.720\nsending an email to Chris or\nwhatever for, on behalf of JT.\n\n444\n00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:53.730\nChrist would see it as it's just\nstraight from Justin Timberlake.\n\n445\n00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:57.750\nEven though he didn't see any thing of\nthat cuz Lance is the one actually doing\n\n446\n00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.340\nall of his dirty work.\n\n447\n00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.210\nSo that's where we put\nthat in the Send As.\n\n448\n00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:03.590\nNow notice you could do it in either one.\n\n449\n00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.350\nYou could wanna go ahead and\ndo just Send on Behalf.\n\n450\n00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:06.170\nAnd that's what I said,\n\n451\n00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:09.750\nsometimes their whole like, I still\ncan't send on the behalf of somebody.\n\n452\n00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:13.480\nYou might have to have the IT\npeople come and set it here too, so\n\n453\n00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.606\njust letting you know that.\n\n454\n00:25:14.606 --> 00:25:18.640\nOne other side note, if you are somebody\nthat's in a small organization and\n\n455\n00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.480\nyou're going into this level right here.\n\n456\n00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.740\nDo not take off this NT authority self,\n\n457\n00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:29.220\nbecause JT is like the person,\nis like the name on the lease, right?\n\n458\n00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.070\nIt's his name on the buying or\n\n459\n00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:36.840\npurchasing of the subscription for\nall of Office Pro download codes.\n\n460\n00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.160\nSo don't get rid of that.\n\n461\n00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.824\nKeep that there.\nDon't touch it, okay?\n\n462\n00:25:39.824 --> 00:25:43.209\nSo, just showing you that this is\non the admin level of what you do,\n\n463\n00:25:43.209 --> 00:25:46.360\nyou go ahead and click Save or\nin this case, I'll hit Cancel.\n\n464\n00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.070\nAnd so that's not too hard, is it?\n\n465\n00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:53.180\nYou just find the right places to go\nahead and set the admin level for\n\n466\n00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.330\nthe access to the accounts online.\n\n467\n00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:01.100\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't too bad, so\nJT, Justin Timberlake,\n\n468\n00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:06.380\nis the person that is going to set up\nall delegation privileges from to to.\n\n469\n00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:11.300\nSo if it was Joey wants\nto delegate to Lance,\n\n470\n00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.530\nJT has to set that up,\nbecause he's the admin.\n\n471\n00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:16.260\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\nAnd a lot of time in an organization,\n\n472\n00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.970\nyou might not ever even get to this\nlevel so you'd have to call somebody.\n\n473\n00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:22.940\nCuz they block off a lot of this stuff for\nyou end users cuz they don't,\n\n474\n00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.270\nI mean, this is everything\nwithin this entire account.\n\n475\n00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.220\nSo you gotta have a special level there.\n\n476\n00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.480\nBut I did wanna at least show you all.\n\n477\n00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.220\nAnd maybe for ya'll end users that don't\never have access to it, it's like,\n\n478\n00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.290\nhey at least I know what\nthey're doing back there.\n\n479\n00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:37.960\nAnd so I can even you know\ntalk talk with them, and\n\n480\n00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.407\njust to show you how this all works,\nI just gonna go head and\n\n481\n00:26:42.407 --> 00:26:48.290\nnow demonstrate that back over here,\nthat's Lance that's go head and.\n\n482\n00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:51.868\nYou know what, there's, we are Lance.\n\n483\n00:26:51.868 --> 00:26:53.740\n[LAUGH] Sorry guys.\n\n484\n00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:57.124\nSo as Lance, you could see here\nthat if go into the mail, and\n\n485\n00:26:57.124 --> 00:26:59.445\nI've got a couple extra tabs over here.\n\n486\n00:26:59.445 --> 00:27:00.946\nLet me go ahead and\nclose out that other one.\n\n487\n00:27:00.946 --> 00:27:04.499\nNow that other one here,\nLance is sending and\n\n488\n00:27:04.499 --> 00:27:09.750\nbeing able to delegate JT's accounts,\nhe's the delegate of JT.\n\n489\n00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:10.600\nSo watch.\n\n490\n00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:15.900\nIf I come over here to Lance and\nI go to Open another mailbox,\n\n491\n00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:22.379\nand we type in Justin Timberlake brings\nup my directory and I click open.\n\n492\n00:27:22.379 --> 00:27:24.571\n[MUSIC]\n\n493\n00:27:24.571 --> 00:27:25.641\nThere we go.\n\n494\n00:27:25.641 --> 00:27:33.520\nNow, we've got Lance having\nfull control over JT's mailbox.\n\n495\n00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.206\nThe whole thing.\n\n496\n00:27:35.206 --> 00:27:37.862\nSo, cuz see it still says\nLance Bass over there.\n\n497\n00:27:37.862 --> 00:27:41.121\nBut, and that's where remember I tried\nto do the greens and the blues so\n\n498\n00:27:41.121 --> 00:27:43.010\nto know who I'm at, at what time.\n\n499\n00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.550\nIf he goes ahead and does this, it is and\n\n500\n00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:49.610\nI'll just show you the from,\nit's from Justin Timberlake.\n\n501\n00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:52.770\nThat Lance is the one behind\nthe keyboard and then he goes ahead.\n\n502\n00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:56.358\nAnd it's nice because then\nLance as regular Lance,\n\n503\n00:27:56.358 --> 00:28:00.523\nthis is his mailbox then Lance says JT,\nthis is his mailbox.\n\n504\n00:28:00.523 --> 00:28:04.010\nYou don't do the whole Add\nthe folder thing in everything when\n\n505\n00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:06.829\nyou're controlling\nsomebody else's account,\n\n506\n00:28:06.829 --> 00:28:11.404\nyou open the other mailbox from this panel\nand then you control it on another tab.\n\n507\n00:28:11.404 --> 00:28:14.638\nIt keeps it a little bit more separate and\nit makes it a lot easier.\n\n508\n00:28:14.638 --> 00:28:22.730\nSo that was Long trip through a very\ncluttered woods of Outlook, like you said.\n\n509\n00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:25.280\nAnd it's like, okay,\nas long as you have the permissions,\n\n510\n00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.989\nall you gotta do is click on\nthe person and open another mailbox.\n\n511\n00:28:27.989 --> 00:28:30.643\nYes, completely, and I could have\njust ended the show right there.\n\n512\n00:28:30.643 --> 00:28:35.973\nBut I really wanted to try to give you\nall that kind of back knowledge to really\n\n513\n00:28:35.973 --> 00:28:41.570\nunderstand the ideas because if you're\nlike me, I wanna know why, but why?\n\n514\n00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:42.260\nWhat about this?\n\n515\n00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.180\nWhat about that?\n\n516\n00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.230\nWhat about this variable?\n\n517\n00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:49.310\nSo I really I wanted to try to give you\nall of that to help you understand,\n\n518\n00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.830\nwhat is it?\n\n519\n00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:55.310\nA pretty basic concept and really like\neasy to do in a sense of like the steps.\n\n520\n00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:59.890\nBut seeing everything to know\nis kind of a big thing for me.\n\n521\n00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:01.270\nSo I'm passing them to you.\n\n522\n00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:02.510\nI hope I didn't confuse you too much.\n\n523\n00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.670\nI confused myself there a little bit.\n\n524\n00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:07.170\n[LAUGH] But\na lot of times you're not gonna have\n\n525\n00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:09.180\naccess to tons of these accounts and\neverything like that.\n\n526\n00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:09.970\nSo, or maybe you are.\n\n527\n00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:11.700\nMaybe you're an administrative assistant.\n\n528\n00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.434\nThat has to manage for even people's\nmailboxes, as long as you have your trusty\n\n529\n00:29:15.434 --> 00:29:17.903\nRonnie IT guide, just go ahead and\nset it up for you.\n\n530\n00:29:17.903 --> 00:29:21.577\nThen you just go ahead and open up\neverybody's mailbox and go to town, so\n\n531\n00:29:21.577 --> 00:29:22.311\nthere you go.\n\n532\n00:29:22.311 --> 00:29:25.448\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, I can definitely say\nthere's a few take aways, number one,\n\n533\n00:29:25.448 --> 00:29:27.067\nif I was an administrative assistant,\n\n534\n00:29:27.067 --> 00:29:29.236\nI would need a flowchart to\nmake sure I knew who I was.\n\n535\n00:29:29.236 --> 00:29:34.166\nNumber two, it ultimately is easy, but\nkeep in mind, you're not necessarily\n\n536\n00:29:34.166 --> 00:29:38.972\nrole playing like we were during this\nepisode, well mostly Vonne actually.\n\n537\n00:29:38.972 --> 00:29:40.920\nI've like trying to assume identities.\n\n538\n00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.090\nNow if you're\nthe administrative assistant,\n\n539\n00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:44.850\nyou may be doing that on behalf.\n\n540\n00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:48.153\nBut just if you're the management,\nwell I need to set it up so\n\n541\n00:29:48.153 --> 00:29:50.088\nLance can send Joey's email, cool.\n\n542\n00:29:50.088 --> 00:29:55.447\nAnd it's pretty easy, but\nI do like that you showed us the sharing.\n\n543\n00:29:55.447 --> 00:29:59.331\nPretty standard, local versus online.\n\n544\n00:29:59.331 --> 00:30:03.452\nBut then it gets a little iffy when\nit comes to, I'll look on the web,\n\n545\n00:30:03.452 --> 00:30:05.315\nversus a local installation.\n\n546\n00:30:05.315 --> 00:30:06.535\nSo thank you so much.\n\n547\n00:30:06.535 --> 00:30:09.417\nI know it was a well-fought battle,\nVonne, but\n\n548\n00:30:09.417 --> 00:30:12.803\nit looks like we are running\nout of time for this episode.\n\n549\n00:30:12.803 --> 00:30:17.133\nBut don't stay away because we've got\nmore Outlook on the web coming at you, so\n\n550\n00:30:17.133 --> 00:30:18.575\ndefinitely tune in.\n\n551\n00:30:18.575 --> 00:30:22.705\nBut for now, signing off for Office Pro\nTV, I've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n552\n00:30:22.705 --> 00:30:23.355\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n553\n00:30:23.355 --> 00:30:24.877\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n554\n00:30:24.877 --> 00:30:30.169\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

You don't control your\nGlobal Address List at all.\n\n319\n00:13:28.013 --> 00:13:31.480\nAnd that's all involved with\nhow the network is setup by\n\n320\n00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.592\nadministrators to be able\nto do things like that.\n\n321\n00:13:34.592 --> 00:13:35.903\nAnd so, and I would do the same thing.\n\n322\n00:13:35.903 --> 00:13:36.491\n&gt;&gt;

Right, you want to ask me as\nan admin to do that for you,\n\n331\n00:14:00.903 --> 00:14:03.663\nthat's one of the calls I\nwould constantly get is.\n\n332\n00:14:03.663 --> 00:14:10.173\nI just got a new computer, and I'm looking\nfor this group list to send Email to.\n\n333\n00:14:10.173 --> 00:14:11.174\nI don't find it.\n\n334\n00:14:11.174 --> 00:14:13.955\nI look at him, yeah, it doesn't exist,\nthat's why you're not finding it.\n\n335\n00:14:13.955 --> 00:14:16.210\nNo, no.\nI use it all the time.\n\n336\n00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.825\nI go, Well it's not in our directory.\n\n337\n00:14:17.825 --> 00:14:21.455\nAnd it's either been deleted since\nyou got your new computer, or\n\n338\n00:14:21.455 --> 00:14:24.055\nit's never been in our directory,\nwhich is more like the case.\n\n339\n00:14:24.055 --> 00:14:25.585\nIt's on a personal list which you created.\n\n340\n00:14:25.585 --> 00:14:29.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it is a hard thing to\nkinda get because it's here but\n\n341\n00:14:29.745 --> 00:14:31.754\nit's there, but wait what?\n\n342\n00:14:31.754 --> 00:14:36.580\n&gt;&gt; As soon as you start typing to\nwhomever, and if it's a group that's fine.\n\n343\n00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.918\nThey just show up.\nThey don't say, well,\n\n344\n00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:39.263\nI got this from your personal list.\n\n345\n00:14:39.263 --> 00:14:41.075\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:30.430\n&gt;&gt; Outstanding.\n\n11\n00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.310\n&gt;&gt; Amazing.\n\n12\n00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.430\n&gt;&gt; On our outlook show.\n\n13\n00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.400\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n&gt;&gt; See, I did a good one there, right?\n\n14\n00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.101\n&gt;&gt; You did, you did good.\n\n15\n00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:36.564\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was thinking like.\n\n16\n00:00:36.564 --> 00:00:37.887\n&gt;&gt; With my help, you could be the best.\n\n17\n00:00:37.887 --> 00:00:40.279\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Maybe.\n\n18\n00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:41.794\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n19\n00:00:41.794 --> 00:00:46.880\nwe're [LAUGH] continuing on with more\nin our contacts show, or people,\n\n20\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.738\ncuz that is the topic of this,\nbecause that's what they called it.\n\n21\n00:00:51.738 --> 00:00:52.679\n&gt;&gt; Or peeps.\n\n22\n00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:54.965\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, shout out to our peeps.\n\n23\n00:00:54.965 --> 00:00:58.636\nSo we're going to create contacts,\nwe're going to edit some contacts, and\n\n24\n00:00:58.636 --> 00:01:01.473\nI'll show you some things\nabout importing and exporting.\n\n25\n00:01:01.473 --> 00:01:04.577\nSo if your haven't checked out\nthe episode before this, or\n\n26\n00:01:04.577 --> 00:01:07.928\nin the library before this,\nwhere we talk about the interface,\n\n27\n00:01:07.928 --> 00:01:11.050\ndefinitely check that one out\nbecause that's not in here.\n\n28\n00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.230\nWe're just going right in there.\n\n29\n00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.640\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\njump into Joey.\n\n30\n00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.430\nAnd we need to make a new contact.\n\n31\n00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.335\nI don't have have you in my contacts\nDaniel, so were going to go ahead and\n\n32\n00:01:22.335 --> 00:01:22.855\ndo that.\n\n33\n00:01:22.855 --> 00:01:25.025\n&gt;&gt; Well we need to remedy that situation,\ndon't we.\n\n34\n00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:28.385\n&gt;&gt; Don't we, so, I just went ahead and\nclicked it before telling you,\n\n35\n00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:30.925\nI'm going to go ahead and\nclick on the button that says New.\n\n36\n00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:33.897\nNow there is a drop down here that\nsays I can do a new contact or\n\n37\n00:01:33.897 --> 00:01:36.109\ncontact list, which we will also address.\n\n38\n00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:40.474\nIt's really just a collection,\nnot to use the word group,\n\n39\n00:01:40.474 --> 00:01:43.632\na collection of emails under one heading.\n\n40\n00:01:43.632 --> 00:01:48.360\nBut you go ahead and use that, and then it\nhas multiple recipients within that list.\n\n41\n00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.820\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go ahead and\nGoogle synonyms for a collection.\n\n42\n00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.670\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n43\n00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.174\n&gt;&gt; I have a feeling a word that starts\n\n44\n00:01:53.174 --> 00:01:54.151\nwith G will be there.\n\n45\n00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:54.804\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but\n\n46\n00:01:54.804 --> 00:01:59.720\nsince groups are something specific in\nOutlook, I was trying to avoid that.\n\n47\n00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.832\nYou know I was doing that.\n\n48\n00:02:00.832 --> 00:02:01.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n49\n00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.787\n&gt;&gt; We were talking about this at length\n\n50\n00:02:03.787 --> 00:02:07.130\nbefore this episode,\nof just why do they wanna go ahead and\n\n51\n00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.575\njust confuse us so much?\n\n52\n00:02:08.575 --> 00:02:12.720\n[LAUGH] So we're gonna go ahead and use\nour new contact, and we're gonna add it.\n\n53\n00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.463\nAnd we're gonna say Daniel Lowrie at,\n\n54\n00:02:15.463 --> 00:02:19.216\nthat's not how you spell your name,\nand there we go.\n\n55\n00:02:19.216 --> 00:02:24.799\nAnd we're just gonna say\nDaniel@awesome.com and there we go.\n\n56\n00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:25.636\n&gt;&gt; You've been to my domain?\n\n57\n00:02:25.636 --> 00:02:27.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n58\n00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.400\nIt is, and so, you can see we\ncan keep on going through here.\n\n59\n00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.110\nNow what if Daniel has\nmultiple email addresses?\n\n60\n00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.080\nCuz you might have your awesome email and\nthen your ITProTV email.\n\n61\n00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.950\nSo we could go ahead and\nadd multiples in there.\n\n62\n00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.760\nAnd notice I can have an email 2, and\nemail 3, because a lot of our contacts,\n\n63\n00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.230\nI mean, they do have, well,\nmultiple email addresses.\n\n64\n00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.150\nAnd that would be the same for\nif they had, well, multiple names.\n\n65\n00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.185\n[LAUGH] Well really, it's just like\nif you had a title and a suffix and\n\n66\n00:02:54.185 --> 00:02:56.432\nthose types of things,\nor a middle name, right?\n\n67\n00:02:56.432 --> 00:02:57.988\nI don't even know your middle name.\n\n68\n00:02:57.988 --> 00:03:00.570\nSo but well-\n&gt;&gt; It's a mystery for the ages isn't it?\n\n69\n00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.499\n&gt;&gt; It is, okay,\nI'll ask you ask you off camera.\n\n70\n00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:06.474\nThat's what I was trying to say.\n\n71\n00:03:06.474 --> 00:03:08.054\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; AFC.\n\n72\n00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:08.576\nAway from camera.\n\n73\n00:03:08.576 --> 00:03:09.907\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so,\n\n74\n00:03:09.907 --> 00:03:13.500\nyou can see this the same thing for\nlike all of the phones and the IMs.\n\n75\n00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.043\nBut notice here,\nif you don't even have a field for\n\n76\n00:03:16.043 --> 00:03:18.482\nan instant message,\nyou can go ahead and add it.\n\n77\n00:03:18.482 --> 00:03:22.085\nI'm not gonna go through every single one\nof these, because ya'll seen how I type,\n\n78\n00:03:22.085 --> 00:03:22.810\nit's not good.\n\n79\n00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.720\nBut the one thing that\nI do want to point out,\n\n80\n00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.740\nbecause when you make a new contact\nin the local installation of it.\n\n81\n00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.770\nHere, I'll just show you.\n\n82\n00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.930\nIf you go to New Contact.\n\n83\n00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.612\nOkay, you know why?\n\n84\n00:03:36.612 --> 00:03:40.020\nSorry, I was in the shared\nfolder of Lance and\n\n85\n00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.050\nI don't have permission to\nwrite to those shared contacts.\n\n86\n00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.780\nI have permission to read,\nbut not create, so\n\n87\n00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.710\nthere's different\npermission levels in here.\n\n88\n00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.170\nSo let's make sure I'm back in my contacts\nbefore I click on new contact, and this is\n\n89\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.360\nwhat I was talking about right here,\nsee where it says company, job, title.\n\n90\n00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.640\nThat's something that I'm just used to\nseeing when I put in the person's name.\n\n91\n00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.090\nWhen I come over to the web interface,\nit actually took me a while.\n\n92\n00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.040\nIt was like, it's in the work section.\n\n93\n00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.330\nThere is the job title, and\nthe department, and the company, and\n\n94\n00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.940\nall of that kind of stuff.\n\n95\n00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.070\nThey actually have quite a few\ndifferent things in here.\n\n96\n00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.090\nBut I'm so\nused to seeing it right with the name,\n\n97\n00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.855\nthat I had to click all\nthe buttons before, there it is.\n\n98\n00:04:18.855 --> 00:04:22.190\nSo in case you're looking for that,\nI figure I'd throw that in there too.\n\n99\n00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.840\nSo we could go ahead and\nput job title of host,\n\n100\n00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.870\nI was gonna say hostess, but\nI'll say host with the most.\n\n101\n00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.040\nSee I can't type [LAUGH] there we.\n\n102\n00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.082\nHost with the host.\n&gt;&gt; Host with the host.\n\n103\n00:04:33.082 --> 00:04:36.008\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And let's keep in going.\n\n104\n00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:38.775\n&gt;&gt; See that, doing a show together.\n\n105\n00:04:38.775 --> 00:04:41.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly\n&gt;&gt; So we could go ahead and\n\n106\n00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.610\nput in addresses, notice we have\na business and a home address.\n\n107\n00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.010\nWe could also put in some other things\nlike your birthday, your anniversary, all\n\n108\n00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.420\nthose different things, your significant\nother, yes, your lovely significant other.\n\n109\n00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.250\n&gt;&gt; She's very pretty.\n\n110\n00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.900\n&gt;&gt; She is.\n\n111\n00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.600\nYes, she's so nice too, I really like her.\n\n112\n00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.700\nSo we have our notes, and then you\ncan add notes that he's pretty okay.\n\n113\n00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.570\nSo you can add anything in there.\n\n114\n00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.740\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, that was funny,\nyou got me, you got me good, aiight.\n\n115\n00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.870\n&gt;&gt; Aiight, yeah exactly.\n\n116\n00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.000\nSo we can add our contact,\nand then we can save it.\n\n117\n00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.040\n&gt;&gt; And then, it goes ahead and\nyou get added into my contacts.\n\n118\n00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.844\nYay, yay, yay.\n\n119\n00:05:22.844 --> 00:05:26.072\nNow, the only thing you can't\ndo in the web interface.\n\n120\n00:05:26.072 --> 00:05:29.140\nWell, there's a lot of things, but\none thing is I can't add a picture.\n\n121\n00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.696\n&gt;&gt; You don't control NASA.\n\n122\n00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:31.542\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n123\n00:05:31.542 --> 00:05:33.980\nSo I can't add a photo of you.\n\n124\n00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.750\nI've looked it up, it doesn't work.\n\n125\n00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.629\nSo at least at the time of this recording-\n&gt;&gt; It's like I'm a vampire or something.\n\n126\n00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:41.691\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No film.\n\n127\n00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:46.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I mean,\nwhat did it pick this background for you?\n\n128\n00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.975\nThis-\n&gt;&gt; It's something like a mountain.\n\n129\n00:05:47.975 --> 00:05:51.765\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's stoic, majestic.\n\n130\n00:05:51.765 --> 00:05:55.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly,\nI just thought that was fun.\n\n131\n00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.725\nOkay, well that's what we got.\n\n132\n00:05:56.725 --> 00:05:57.760\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n133\n00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.940\nyou can see that I can't add a picture for\nyou, but I have your initials in there,\n\n134\n00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.410\nhow I've inserted your contact into\nthis whole system, and so there we go.\n\n135\n00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.980\nSo that's how you could go ahead and\nadd a contact.\n\n136\n00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.313\nNow, there's some other\nways that you could do it.\n\n137\n00:06:12.313 --> 00:06:16.220\nLet's come over here to our mail.\n\n138\n00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.260\nAnd let's go into,\nwhich is the one I want to do?\n\n139\n00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.400\nI want to do Justin Timberlake,\nright here.\n\n140\n00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.940\nNow I have two, there's two examples\nthat I'm gonna pull out from this.\n\n141\n00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.320\nIs something you can do in local versions.\n\n142\n00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.000\nAnd maybe, other people,\ncuz somebody else is on a local version.\n\n143\n00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.560\nThey can send what are known as VCF files.\n\n144\n00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.370\nI think it's virtual card file?\n\n145\n00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.710\nVirtual card format.\n\n146\n00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.180\nIts like, it's the business card.\n\n147\n00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so\n\n148\n00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.260\nif you see this a lot,\nit's like somebody attaches it, and\n\n149\n00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.640\nyou can see I think this\nis what it looks like.\n\n150\n00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.667\nAnd normally in a local\ninstallation of Outlook,\n\n151\n00:06:55.667 --> 00:06:58.124\nyou could double click on this VCF file.\n\n152\n00:06:58.124 --> 00:07:01.767\nIt opens right up into your contacts and\nyou just choose save, and\n\n153\n00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:05.640\nit puts all of that right\ninto your contacts, perfect.\n\n154\n00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:12.690\nYou can't directly import VCF\nfiles into the web interface.\n\n155\n00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.030\nYou could download it, but\n\n156\n00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.120\nthe file format itself, It doesn't\nreally work in this environment.\n\n157\n00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.650\nSo that's kind of like a all right.\n\n158\n00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.920\nThe things is, this is one of those I,\nyou can't do that but,\n\n159\n00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:32.000\nhow somebody creates this virtual card\nfile is from their contact information\n\n160\n00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.030\nin their, because you basically\nmake your own contact for yourself,\n\n161\n00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.160\nput in all your stuff, make it a VCF file\nand then, you go ahead and attach it.\n\n162\n00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.450\nWell, then you had all that\ninformation in your contact anyways.\n\n163\n00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:48.361\nSo this should, most of the time,\nbe the same, if it's the same person.\n\n164\n00:07:48.361 --> 00:07:50.176\nIf they're sending you\nsomebody else's virtual card,\n\n165\n00:07:50.176 --> 00:07:51.241\nthen that's a different story.\n\n166\n00:07:51.241 --> 00:07:56.497\nBut if I click on the person's name, cuz\nsee, I got the little finger right there,\n\n167\n00:07:56.497 --> 00:07:59.649\nwhen I'm on The sender's name,\nif I click on it,\n\n168\n00:07:59.649 --> 00:08:04.704\nit actually opens up all the information\nthat is associated with that contact.\n\n169\n00:08:04.704 --> 00:08:08.122\nIn this instance,\nJustin is sending me his business card.\n\n170\n00:08:08.122 --> 00:08:10.770\nIt had to come from his account,\nso I'm gonna get everything.\n\n171\n00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.824\nSo you can see I've got\nall the contact details.\n\n172\n00:08:12.824 --> 00:08:16.217\nIf I click on this and I scroll all\nthrough this, you can see if you go\n\n173\n00:08:16.217 --> 00:08:20.353\na little lower down behind me, there you\ngo, you can see I got IM and the profile.\n\n174\n00:08:20.353 --> 00:08:25.659\nAll of this stuff is associated\nwith his contact information,\n\n175\n00:08:25.659 --> 00:08:28.672\nso I'm gonna get anything anyway.\n\n176\n00:08:28.672 --> 00:08:32.882\nSo how can I add this to my Contact\nfrom here in my web interface?\n\n177\n00:08:32.882 --> 00:08:36.310\nIt's these three little dots at the top,\nthe More Actions button.\n\n178\n00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:37.540\nSo, there it is.\n\n179\n00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.800\nAdd to Contacts.\n\n180\n00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.190\nAnd really quickly,\nthis view SharePoint profile,\n\n181\n00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:46.040\nthat's just because we're all on\nthe same domain for Office Pro Demo Co.\n\n182\n00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.450\nSo you're like, I don't see that, and\nthat's because you don't have anything\n\n183\n00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:49.810\nassociated with the SharePoint,\nso it's okay.\n\n184\n00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.640\nSo, I click Add to Contacts, and\nthen it comes right into here,\n\n185\n00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.700\npopulates everything into there.\n\n186\n00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.810\nAnd I could add more here\nif I wanted to go ahead and\n\n187\n00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:03.670\nput in my own notes or anything other,\nor so on and so forth.\n\n188\n00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:08.120\nSo you go ahead and either keep what they\ngave you, add more in, click Save, and\n\n189\n00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.590\nthen you've just created a contact\nfrom somebody e-mailing you.\n\n190\n00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.600\nAnd that's really,\nreally handy cuz that's like,\n\n191\n00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.790\nhey I know I'm gonna start talking to this\nperson, add them right into my contacts.\n\n192\n00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.660\nSo that's pretty easy to do.\n\n193\n00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.560\nBut it also depends what's in there.\n\n194\n00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.750\nIt might only be just their name and\ntheir e-mail address, so\n\n195\n00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.740\nyou could always come back later and\npopulate it.\n\n196\n00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.710\nFor example, if I go back over into\nMy People, and let's say I need to\n\n197\n00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:39.820\nadd some more information\ninto Justin's contacts.\n\n198\n00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:40.830\nSo if I go ahead and\n\n199\n00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:45.850\nclick on it, notice the same little\nbuttons are right there with More Actions.\n\n200\n00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:51.560\nNow that it's in my contacts, I can\ngo to and edit the contact from here.\n\n201\n00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.990\nYou also had it from up on\nthe top of the main menu,\n\n202\n00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:55.830\nis that I can go ahead and edit.\n\n203\n00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.780\nAnd then it just takes me right into the\nsame place that we keep on going back to\n\n204\n00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.333\nwhen we create our contacts.\n\n205\n00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:07.160\nAnd you can add another\nthing in the work like,\n\n206\n00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.360\nthe Job Title is Mr. Fantastic.\n\n207\n00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.803\nFantastic that I will be seeing\nyou very soon in October Mr. JT.\n\n208\n00:10:14.803 --> 00:10:15.303\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am.\n\n209\n00:10:15.303 --> 00:10:16.120\n&gt;&gt; Don't gush.\n\n210\n00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.770\nIt doesn't become you.\n\n211\n00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:19.630\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty awesome.\n\n212\n00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.720\nBut I'm very excited.\n\n213\n00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.660\nSo I get to see him in concert.\n\n214\n00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.630\nYes, again.\n\n215\n00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:24.470\nOkay, anyways.\n\n216\n00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.160\nSo, we've got that going on, and\n\n217\n00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.850\nyou can go ahead and\nedit your contact if you need to.\n\n218\n00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.130\nOkay, so now,\nlet's talk about those folders.\n\n219\n00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:37.940\nFrom the other episode, we learned\nthat you can create other folders,\n\n220\n00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.400\nand I even showed you a quick\nlittle version of how.\n\n221\n00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.610\nThe thing is,\nyou can't start moving contacts around.\n\n222\n00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.460\nYou cannot organize them.\n\n223\n00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.670\nI can't take my Daniel Lowrie contact and\n\n224\n00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:53.740\nmove it into my personal contacts, cuz he\nwants to hang out with Fuego and Bishop.\n\n225\n00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:54.420\nI know you do, so.\n\n226\n00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.830\n&gt;&gt; They're cool cats, man.\n\n227\n00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they are pretty cool cats.\n\n228\n00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.090\n&gt;&gt; They're swinging cats.\n\n229\n00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.085\n&gt;&gt; It's like you know\nthem from the episodes.\n\n230\n00:11:00.085 --> 00:11:01.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is kinda like that now.\n\n231\n00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.710\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n[LAUGH] So\n\n232\n00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:07.415\nbut I can't take this and go to,\nsee, there's no move button up here.\n\n233\n00:11:07.415 --> 00:11:09.080\nNo, not at all.\n\n234\n00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.650\nCan't right-click on it.\n\n235\n00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.550\nI can copy the e-mail address,\nand it's just gonna go ahead and\n\n236\n00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:17.201\nput that in there where it says I've\ncopied this to the clipboard, okay?\n\n237\n00:11:17.201 --> 00:11:20.640\nBut no, there's nothing that tells me\nhow I can move this into Personal.\n\n238\n00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.476\nI don't know why,\nit's just not gonna work.\n\n239\n00:11:23.476 --> 00:11:24.930\n&gt;&gt; What if you open it?\n\n240\n00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.690\n&gt;&gt; You can, well, here,\nI can open it over here.\n\n241\n00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.860\nI can edit the contacts,\nand there's nothing,\n\n242\n00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.620\nthere's no button that says like Copy.\n\n243\n00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.579\nCuz I was even just,\neven if I could just copy a contact and\n\n244\n00:11:36.579 --> 00:11:39.613\nmake a new one put it in, and\nno, it doesn't do anything.\n\n245\n00:11:39.613 --> 00:11:42.945\n&gt;&gt; What if you start from\nthe other end of the spectrum?\n\n246\n00:11:42.945 --> 00:11:47.659\nWhat if you go into where you wanna be and\nstart to create a new contact, and\n\n247\n00:11:47.659 --> 00:11:48.582\nthen import?\n\n248\n00:11:48.582 --> 00:11:49.792\nMaybe that does that?\n\n249\n00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:54.637\n&gt;&gt; Well, you're, okay, like, yeah,\nthen you went into this whole import, but\n\n250\n00:11:54.637 --> 00:11:55.820\nthat is a key.\n\n251\n00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:01.680\nIf I knew that I wanted to have\nyou in the Personal folder,\n\n252\n00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.750\nI should have gone to the Personal\nfolder first, then create a new context.\n\n253\n00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.990\nBut there's still no in port into.\n\n254\n00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.530\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's only if you knew that beforehand.\n\n255\n00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.630\nIf you didn't after the fact and it's\nalready created what are you gonna do?\n\n256\n00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:16.840\n&gt;&gt; And that's the way I do everything.\n\n257\n00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.320\nI put everything on my desktop.\n\n258\n00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.260\n&gt;&gt; You're manually creating\ncontexts at this point, right?\n\n259\n00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's like I put everything on my desktop.\n\n260\n00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.990\nAnd then I file it away later once.\n\n261\n00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:27.210\nCuz that's just my way\nof organizing my files.\n\n262\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.461\nSo, I don't think that far ahead.\n\n263\n00:12:29.461 --> 00:12:30.620\nI organize after.\n\n264\n00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.870\nSo this is, for me,\nI don't think this linear.\n\n265\n00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:41.285\nSo, but notice, if I did put Personal, and\nI went into here, and then I put Dan L.\n\n266\n00:12:41.285 --> 00:12:46.425\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you can see if I go ahead and\n\n267\n00:12:46.425 --> 00:12:49.758\nadd, dan@dan.com.\n\n268\n00:12:49.758 --> 00:12:52.996\nAnd then we go with, I don't call you Dan.\n\n269\n00:12:52.996 --> 00:12:54.150\nPeople call you Daniel, right?\n\n270\n00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.873\n&gt;&gt; That's what I go by, yeah.\n\n271\n00:12:54.873 --> 00:12:57.713\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I was like-\n&gt;&gt; A couple of people I know all my life\n\n272\n00:12:57.713 --> 00:12:58.500\ncall me Dan.\n\n273\n00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I didn't think so.\n\n274\n00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.160\nAnd no Danny, right?\n\n275\n00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.090\n&gt;&gt; No, never been a Danny.\n\n276\n00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, now you all know too.\n\n277\n00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:08.137\n&gt;&gt; It's been quite the conversation\nthroughout my entire life.\n\n278\n00:13:08.137 --> 00:13:09.424\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure.\n&gt;&gt; Not Dan or Danny?\n\n279\n00:13:09.424 --> 00:13:11.100\nJust Daniel?\n\n280\n00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:11.890\nThat is my name.\n\n281\n00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:12.920\n&gt;&gt; Your actual name?\n\n282\n00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.018\n&gt;&gt; My actual name.\n\n283\n00:13:14.018 --> 00:13:15.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Weird [LAUGH]\n\n284\n00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.490\n&gt;&gt; Why would you do that?\n\n285\n00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.504\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you're gonna go by smurf.\n\n286\n00:13:19.504 --> 00:13:21.840\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know what I get a lot?\n\n287\n00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.060\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; Is Vonn short for anything?\n\n288\n00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.522\nI'm like, short for what?\n\n289\n00:13:25.522 --> 00:13:26.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n290\n00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.720\n&gt;&gt; What could it be short for?\n\n291\n00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, it could be short for Yvonne.\n\n292\n00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:30.990\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n293\n00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.504\n&gt;&gt; All right, which I've had some\npeople I have actually known.\n\n294\n00:13:34.504 --> 00:13:38.170\nBut there's very few people\nI know with my name.\n\n295\n00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.390\nBut it's, anyways, we should stop talking\nabout names cuz it goes on a whole other\n\n296\n00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.983\nsubject [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Mispronounced my entire\n\n297\n00:13:43.983 --> 00:13:44.720\nlife, yes.\n\n298\n00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.320\nIt's like, it's not that hard of a name.\n\n299\n00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.840\n[LAUGH] But anyways, so\nyou can see that we've got that\n\n300\n00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.600\nI have to be in the folder\nbefore I make the contact for\n\n301\n00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.840\nit to go into that particular folder\nat the time of this recording.\n\n302\n00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.050\nI'm always gonna put that asterisk on\nthis one because just to make sure.\n\n303\n00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.620\nSo, just wanna point that out to you.\n\n304\n00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:10.505\nNow, the other thing that you\ncan't do in the web version,\n\n305\n00:14:10.505 --> 00:14:15.800\nis you can't assign\na category to a contact.\n\n306\n00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.230\nYou can in local version.\n\n307\n00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:22.860\nSo you could come into any of your\ncontacts in here, and if I went to like\n\n308\n00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:28.330\nDemo Guy Test Person, I can categorize\nthis as purple or what have you.\n\n309\n00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.200\nAnd then that's associated with Purple.\n\n310\n00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.440\nAnd then of course,\nwith our searches and everything and\n\n311\n00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.745\nhow I can kind of see things by category,\ngreat.\n\n312\n00:14:36.745 --> 00:14:40.503\nWe've already talked about how the\nlimitations of seeing things by category\n\n313\n00:14:40.503 --> 00:14:41.494\nin the web version.\n\n314\n00:14:41.494 --> 00:14:45.700\nBut you still can use that category\n\n315\n00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:50.648\nkeyword search that I say category and.\n\n316\n00:14:50.648 --> 00:14:53.106\nNot catar, cate.\n\n317\n00:14:53.106 --> 00:14:53.834\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n318\n00:14:53.834 --> 00:14:56.480\n[LAUGH]\nPurple.\n\n319\n00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.150\nDid it already take yet?\n\n320\n00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.730\nOkay, not yet.\n\n321\n00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.130\nI don't think it populated that.\n\n322\n00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:07.150\nYou know what, I know there is one for\nband, though, because I have done that.\n\n323\n00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:07.840\nThere you go.\n\n324\n00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:15.150\nSo JC and Lance have a category of yellow,\nwhich I have named band and Joey's stuff.\n\n325\n00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.990\nSo you can still go ahead and\nfind it by the search.\n\n326\n00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:22.150\nYou just don't really\nsee it anywhere within\n\n327\n00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.250\nany of the interfaces that you've got.\n\n328\n00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.838\nAnd that's why you just don't see it,\nokay?\n\n329\n00:15:27.838 --> 00:15:31.890\nThey still exist,\nit just doesn't totally go there.\n\n330\n00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:35.100\nAll right, okay, so now,\nnow we need to go to Contact lists.\n\n331\n00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.444\n&gt;&gt; This is what we've all\nbeen waiting for, Vonne.\n\n332\n00:15:37.444 --> 00:15:39.304\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n333\n00:15:39.304 --> 00:15:43.440\n&gt;&gt; Let the fuel on\nthe confusion fire burn bright.\n\n334\n00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.140\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, because, all right,\nso I specifically said not Groups,\n\n335\n00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.002\ncuz we talked about how Groups\nis like a special clique.\n\n336\n00:15:50.002 --> 00:15:51.589\nThat's how I keep associating it.\n\n337\n00:15:51.589 --> 00:15:53.603\nIn our other episode we talked\na little bit about that.\n\n338\n00:15:53.603 --> 00:15:58.371\nSo it is something that's\nvery A new thing that\n\n339\n00:15:58.371 --> 00:16:02.774\nMicrosoft does and has termed groups, but\n\n340\n00:16:02.774 --> 00:16:08.650\na contact list is also known\nas a distribution list.\n\n341\n00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:13.695\nFor people like me that have been using\nthis stuff for a long, long time,\n\n342\n00:16:13.695 --> 00:16:19.498\na distribution list was just a list of who\nyou're going to distribute messages to.\n\n343\n00:16:19.498 --> 00:16:20.650\n&gt;&gt; Those email out to, yeah.\n\n344\n00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:25.601\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\nI could name it ITProTV hosts.\n\n345\n00:16:25.601 --> 00:16:27.028\nWe actually have one of those, don't we?\n\n346\n00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:27.653\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n347\n00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:29.740\nin the hosts it would have all of us.\n\n348\n00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:34.203\nAll eight, nine, however many of us there\nare now, and so we would have Daniel,\n\n349\n00:16:34.203 --> 00:16:37.615\nMike, and Vonne, and,\nI almost said Vonne and me, [LAUGH] but\n\n350\n00:16:37.615 --> 00:16:42.013\nwe have all our hosts in there and all you\nhave to type in is that name of the group,\n\n351\n00:16:42.013 --> 00:16:44.078\nand then it goes ahead and does that.\n\n352\n00:16:44.078 --> 00:16:47.263\nAll right, well,\nthey still call it distributionless\n\n353\n00:16:47.263 --> 00:16:49.840\nsome places, like in the-\n&gt;&gt; Probably if you're in\n\n354\n00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.285\na active directory domain, like\nan enterprise, a corporate environment,\n\n355\n00:16:53.285 --> 00:16:55.459\nthey'll probably call\nit a distribution list.\n\n356\n00:16:55.459 --> 00:16:57.993\nBut now they call them contact groups,\nor contact lists?\n\n357\n00:16:57.993 --> 00:17:00.102\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nif they call it contact lists, but\n\n358\n00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:03.377\nthen in the local version sometimes\nthey call it contact group.\n\n359\n00:17:03.377 --> 00:17:05.800\nIt's really weird, so-\n&gt;&gt; And they are synonymous.\n\n360\n00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.323\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n361\n00:17:06.323 --> 00:17:07.601\n&gt;&gt; They're not different things.\n\n362\n00:17:07.601 --> 00:17:08.123\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n363\n00:17:08.123 --> 00:17:08.837\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not weird, at all.\n\n364\n00:17:08.837 --> 00:17:09.915\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n365\n00:17:09.915 --> 00:17:11.338\nThere's that confusion of, so\n\n366\n00:17:11.338 --> 00:17:14.775\nwhy are we calling it four different\nthings when it's really the same thing?\n\n367\n00:17:14.775 --> 00:17:16.750\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat you have to take Microsoft training.\n\n368\n00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And give them the money, right?\n\n369\n00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:18.991\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes.\n\n370\n00:17:18.991 --> 00:17:20.286\n&gt;&gt; That's why I'm convinced, convinced.\n\n371\n00:17:20.286 --> 00:17:22.791\n&gt;&gt; Yes, or you just keep watching us,\nand we'll tell you.\n\n372\n00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:23.675\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Forget them.\n\n373\n00:17:23.675 --> 00:17:24.406\nWatch us.\n\n374\n00:17:24.406 --> 00:17:25.008\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n375\n00:17:25.008 --> 00:17:29.625\nSo that's how you can go ahead and\nsay, I need to put Lance, JC, and\n\n376\n00:17:29.625 --> 00:17:34.161\nJoey all in one group, because I\ndon't want to have to keep going,\n\n377\n00:17:34.161 --> 00:17:36.921\nokay Joey, Justin, all those people.\n\n378\n00:17:36.921 --> 00:17:41.863\nI just wanna hot type in the crew, or\nthe boys, or whatever I wanna type in,\n\n379\n00:17:41.863 --> 00:17:45.247\nand then it just goes ahead and\nputs it all in there.\n\n380\n00:17:45.247 --> 00:17:49.280\nSo down in here,\nhow can we make a new contact group?\n\n381\n00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.736\nFrom scratch,\nyou can come into this drop down and\n\n382\n00:17:52.736 --> 00:17:57.116\nchoose contact list,\nnotice that group, not the same thing.\n\n383\n00:17:57.116 --> 00:17:58.264\nThat's separate.\n\n384\n00:17:58.264 --> 00:18:03.485\nSo we're gonna say new contact list,\nand then what's the list name,\n\n385\n00:18:03.485 --> 00:18:08.281\nand we'll just say, we'll say,\nthe band, and you know what?\n\n386\n00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:12.807\nI can honestly tell you, I don't know if,\nlike the capital and the spaces,\n\n387\n00:18:12.807 --> 00:18:14.292\nsince it's a web thing,\n\n388\n00:18:14.292 --> 00:18:18.000\nI wanna do the underscore band,\nlower case, the whole nine.\n\n389\n00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.100\nI'm gonna assume that all the spaces and\n\n390\n00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.264\neverything is okay, but-\n&gt;&gt; Only one way we found out.\n\n391\n00:18:26.264 --> 00:18:27.316\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\n\n392\n00:18:27.316 --> 00:18:28.600\nYou know what?\nWe're gonna say, The Band.\n\n393\n00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.162\nAll right, there we go, and then we're\ngonna go ahead and add members, and\n\n394\n00:18:33.162 --> 00:18:36.957\nyou can see that if I start typing,\nif I start typing in Justin.\n\n395\n00:18:36.957 --> 00:18:39.353\nNotice, it's just gonna\npull up all my contacts.\n\n396\n00:18:39.353 --> 00:18:42.231\nThis is one thing that I would start\ngoing ahead and creating groups.\n\n397\n00:18:42.231 --> 00:18:44.801\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Nope, sorry, list [LAUGH] and\n\n398\n00:18:44.801 --> 00:18:49.648\nthen I realized like,\nI hadn't added them to my contacts.\n\n399\n00:18:49.648 --> 00:18:52.430\nThey were still in the global address\nlist that we're talking about.\n\n400\n00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.856\nI was like, okay,\nlet me go into the global address list,\n\n401\n00:18:55.856 --> 00:19:00.446\nadd them to my regular contacts, come back\nin to the group, list, sorry, [LAUGH] and\n\n402\n00:19:00.446 --> 00:19:01.434\nthen add them in.\n\n403\n00:19:01.434 --> 00:19:05.642\nSo that is one of those things,\nthey have to be in your contacts for\n\n404\n00:19:05.642 --> 00:19:10.246\nit to be able to pull, and understand\nthat, it needs to be in your list.\n\n405\n00:19:10.246 --> 00:19:14.491\nSo, we'll go ahead and\nsay we'll add Justin, and\n\n406\n00:19:14.491 --> 00:19:20.119\nthen we'll add Lance, and\nthen we'll add JC, and that's good for\n\n407\n00:19:20.119 --> 00:19:24.658\nnow, not that I'm,\nwe can go ahead and add Chris too,\n\n408\n00:19:24.658 --> 00:19:29.052\nand then we can add,\nwell Justin's the last one.\n\n409\n00:19:29.052 --> 00:19:29.785\nOkay, perfect.\n\n410\n00:19:29.785 --> 00:19:32.004\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, well Joey's already in there, so\n\n411\n00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:34.118\nhe's the one adding it, wonderful.\n\n412\n00:19:34.118 --> 00:19:38.468\nSo we go ahead and click save, and\nokay, yeah, all the spacing is fine.\n\n413\n00:19:38.468 --> 00:19:41.971\nSorry that's just an old web thing for\nme, you can't have any spaces, you\n\n414\n00:19:41.971 --> 00:19:46.043\ncan't have any capital, or you shouldn't\ncapitalize, all that kind of good stuff.\n\n415\n00:19:46.043 --> 00:19:46.602\nAll right wonderful.\n\n416\n00:19:46.602 --> 00:19:51.515\nSo now I can see that, hey if I'm here in\nmy contacts, and I wanna send a message\n\n417\n00:19:51.515 --> 00:19:56.502\nto all these people, or any one person,\nnotice when I have it right there I can go\n\n418\n00:19:56.502 --> 00:20:01.489\nahead and send a message, and I click on\nit, well I will try to do that again, and\n\n419\n00:20:01.489 --> 00:20:06.402\nI will send the message, and no I won't,\nokay well you might wanna go ahead and\n\n420\n00:20:06.402 --> 00:20:09.800\ndo a refresh here, [LAUGH] and\nsee if it works that way.\n\n421\n00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.362\nSo and that way,\nI can go ahead and address, and\n\n422\n00:20:13.362 --> 00:20:18.618\nmessage right from my contacts, and\nwe're gonna try one more time and\n\n423\n00:20:18.618 --> 00:20:21.399\nsee if it'll work, and there we go.\n\n424\n00:20:21.399 --> 00:20:26.670\nNow I've got the finger, and\nnow I can go ahead and create a message.\n\n425\n00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.509\nYou know what's happening?\n\n426\n00:20:28.509 --> 00:20:32.518\nThis is, this is on me,\nsorry, see that right there?\n\n427\n00:20:32.518 --> 00:20:34.353\nPop-ups are blocked.\n\n428\n00:20:34.353 --> 00:20:37.485\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and remember how I was so\nexcited about that one\n\n429\n00:20:37.485 --> 00:20:42.443\nsetting when we did the customize,\nthe organize, customize, and search, my.\n\n430\n00:20:42.443 --> 00:20:45.881\nWe, I went ahead and said, always\nstart a new message in a new window.\n\n431\n00:20:45.881 --> 00:20:46.810\n&gt;&gt; That's correct you did.\n\n432\n00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:50.452\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well I also forgot to\nturn off the pop-ups [LAUGH].\n\n433\n00:20:50.452 --> 00:20:52.329\nSo, I should go ahead and-\n&gt;&gt; You can make exceptions right,\n\n434\n00:20:52.329 --> 00:20:53.598\nyou don't have to have it turned off?\n\n435\n00:20:53.598 --> 00:20:57.082\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and I just need to tell\nChrome right now, just go ahead,\n\n436\n00:20:57.082 --> 00:20:59.777\nanytime that I'm in here go ahead and\nallow it.\n\n437\n00:20:59.777 --> 00:21:02.894\nSo, and this has happened to me for\ncouple of days now, and I was,\n\n438\n00:21:02.894 --> 00:21:05.107\nhonestly I was waiting,\nbecause it was like,\n\n439\n00:21:05.107 --> 00:21:08.041\nI hope this happens during my episode so\nI could show people.\n\n440\n00:21:08.041 --> 00:21:08.780\n&gt;&gt; So I can point that out.\n\n441\n00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:09.545\nThat's right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n442\n00:21:09.545 --> 00:21:10.818\nthen it got me all lost again.\n\n443\n00:21:10.818 --> 00:21:11.770\n&gt;&gt; Those happy mistakes, right?\n\n444\n00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So there we go.\n\n445\n00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.317\nSee, now it works.\n\n446\n00:21:15.317 --> 00:21:16.688\nThat's probably why it\nwasn't working last time.\n\n447\n00:21:16.688 --> 00:21:17.234\n&gt;&gt; Probably.\n\n448\n00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:21.047\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\na good refresh is always a first start.\n\n449\n00:21:21.047 --> 00:21:23.915\nSo you can see that I've got a,\nwell, you know what?\n\n450\n00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:25.920\nIt started a message,\nand it didn't populate.\n\n451\n00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.770\nWell, that's okay.\n\n452\n00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:31.665\nWe can just go ahead and site the band,\nand, well we'll go with,\n\n453\n00:21:31.665 --> 00:21:33.534\nwe'll go with the crew.\n\n454\n00:21:33.534 --> 00:21:34.169\n&gt;&gt; Same kind of thing.\n\n455\n00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:34.722\n&gt;&gt; Same idea.\n\n456\n00:21:34.722 --> 00:21:37.183\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then you got all of that and\n\n457\n00:21:37.183 --> 00:21:40.228\nnotice that this can't\nbe expanded right now.\n\n458\n00:21:40.228 --> 00:21:42.244\nOkay cuz normally you could go ahead and\n\n459\n00:21:42.244 --> 00:21:44.576\nclick that button when\nyou have a group list.\n\n460\n00:21:44.576 --> 00:21:45.422\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n461\n00:21:45.422 --> 00:21:48.152\n&gt;&gt; That you can [LAUGH] click the button\nand it shows all the recipients.\n\n462\n00:21:48.152 --> 00:21:50.693\n&gt;&gt; Then it gets mad and says,\nonce you've done this you can't undo it.\n\n463\n00:21:50.693 --> 00:21:52.260\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n464\n00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.629\nYes, it gets very angry, and it's like,\nno, I understand, it's okay.\n\n465\n00:21:55.629 --> 00:21:57.344\n&gt;&gt; So to verify that I'm sending\nthis to the right people.\n\n466\n00:21:57.344 --> 00:22:00.252\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I do that all the time, so just in\n\n467\n00:22:00.252 --> 00:22:05.044\ncase, mine's not cooperating, perfectly\nright now but you get the idea that we can\n\n468\n00:22:05.044 --> 00:22:09.526\ndo it and I really thought it was gonna\npopulate, but okay, we're all right.\n\n469\n00:22:09.526 --> 00:22:14.425\nI am going to go ahead and leave this\nwindow, and we can go on from there.\n\n470\n00:22:14.425 --> 00:22:15.785\nSo creating a contact list,\n\n471\n00:22:15.785 --> 00:22:20.465\nnow there's another way that you\ncan do this if you wanted to.\n\n472\n00:22:20.465 --> 00:22:25.388\nYou could take, let's go over into my,\nnot my directory,\n\n473\n00:22:25.388 --> 00:22:31.010\nmy contacts, and I will go over in\nmy other contacts, my personal.\n\n474\n00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.579\nSo let's just say that I needed\nto have all of these people, or\n\n475\n00:22:34.579 --> 00:22:38.024\nhowever many people, make,\nI wanna make a list from them.\n\n476\n00:22:38.024 --> 00:22:39.887\nSo you can-\n&gt;&gt; But wait, I'm the only people in there.\n\n477\n00:22:39.887 --> 00:22:43.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes, well you know what,\n\n478\n00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.863\nyou're gonna be included with them.\n\n479\n00:22:44.863 --> 00:22:45.775\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n480\n00:22:45.775 --> 00:22:46.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so,\n\n481\n00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:50.177\ndan@dan.com, you can see that\nI've got all three of them.\n\n482\n00:22:50.177 --> 00:22:51.696\nAll I did was did a shift click.\n\n483\n00:22:51.696 --> 00:22:56.585\nI did a single click, hold my shift key,\nor if I only wanted Fuego and not Dan,\n\n484\n00:22:56.585 --> 00:22:59.796\nyou know Bishop and Fuego, notice-\n&gt;&gt; Put them on the non-people list.\n\n485\n00:22:59.796 --> 00:23:02.428\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] I could, well come one,\n\n486\n00:23:02.428 --> 00:23:03.213\nthere we go.\n\n487\n00:23:03.213 --> 00:23:06.917\nI had to hover right over\nthat little checkbox.\n\n488\n00:23:06.917 --> 00:23:10.621\nSo notice you select them all from\nyour list, and I'll just go ahead and\n\n489\n00:23:10.621 --> 00:23:14.958\nthrow in Dan, cuz you're Daniel, not Dan,\nso it's a totally different person.\n\n490\n00:23:14.958 --> 00:23:19.956\n[LAUGH] We've got this, and\nup at the top, where it says list,\n\n491\n00:23:19.956 --> 00:23:25.053\nI can create a new contact list\nfrom selecting them in my list and\n\n492\n00:23:25.053 --> 00:23:27.094\nthen name this The cats.\n\n493\n00:23:27.094 --> 00:23:29.021\nOkay, and we click enter, and\n\n494\n00:23:29.021 --> 00:23:33.545\nthen notice that now I have a distribution\nlist that has the members, and\n\n495\n00:23:33.545 --> 00:23:37.713\nyou can see behind my head,\nthe members of this particular group.\n\n496\n00:23:37.713 --> 00:23:42.521\nWe've got Bishop, we've got Dan,\nand we've got Fuego Cat.\n\n497\n00:23:42.521 --> 00:23:44.124\nSo you can see that we've got all of them.\n\n498\n00:23:44.124 --> 00:23:45.645\nThey really are back there,\nso there you go.\n\n499\n00:23:45.645 --> 00:23:48.573\nSo now you can see, and\nlook all the pretty colors that I got.\n\n500\n00:23:48.573 --> 00:23:50.062\nI like this color scheme\ngoing on right now.\n\n501\n00:23:50.062 --> 00:23:54.627\n[LAUGH] So, now you can just see\nthe members within the group.\n\n502\n00:23:54.627 --> 00:23:58.866\nSo two ways that you can create those\nlists, go ahead and make list, and\n\n503\n00:23:58.866 --> 00:23:59.721\nadd members.\n\n504\n00:23:59.721 --> 00:24:03.680\nSelect them in your list,\ngo up to the top, and create them.\n\n505\n00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.986\nNow.\nWhat if I realized I really don't need\n\n506\n00:24:06.986 --> 00:24:08.580\nthat Contact List.\n\n507\n00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.545\nI almost hit Distribution List.\n\n508\n00:24:09.545 --> 00:24:11.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's the same thing.\n\n509\n00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.130\nI don't need this anymore,\nso I wanna make it go away.\n\n510\n00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:16.810\nSorry, you can't right click on there.\n\n511\n00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.970\nBut you can select it and go up to Delete.\n\n512\n00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:21.630\nSo if I wanna delete this out.\n\n513\n00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:23.380\nYou sure you want it to be deleted?\n\n514\n00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.430\nYes, I do.\nAnd you know what, sorry, Dan.\n\n515\n00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.115\n&gt;&gt; I wonder who that guy is.\n\n516\n00:24:28.115 --> 00:24:31.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I keep wanting to right click,\nsorry.\n\n517\n00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:35.250\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and select it,\nand then Delete, and then it goes away.\n\n518\n00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.180\nNow, is it gone forever?\n\n519\n00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:42.373\nNo, it's actually over in our deleted\nitems over in our mail folder.\n\n520\n00:24:42.373 --> 00:24:46.790\nSo if I go over to deleted items,\nyou should be able to see, there they are.\n\n521\n00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:52.230\nAnd notice that I can tell that this is\na contact because of the little icon.\n\n522\n00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:53.630\nSee right there?\n\n523\n00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:58.150\nWell I didn't want to hover too close, cuz\nthen it turns to a Trashcan, let's see.\n\n524\n00:24:58.150 --> 00:24:59.640\nThat looks like a little notecard.\n\n525\n00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.380\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's an indication to you,\n\n526\n00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:05.930\nand then like this one down here,\nso that's a meeting.\n\n527\n00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:09.971\nSo, the little icons do actually\ntell you quite a few things,\n\n528\n00:25:09.971 --> 00:25:12.782\nif you just look at them carefully enough.\n\n529\n00:25:12.782 --> 00:25:17.120\nWe did talk about in the other episode,\nbut you can't share contacts.\n\n530\n00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.391\nIt's just not a possibility.\n\n531\n00:25:19.391 --> 00:25:26.410\nSo, if you needed to take this information\nand send it to somebody as a VCF card.\n\n532\n00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:29.520\nYou'd have to do that in\na local version only,\n\n533\n00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.610\nit's just not possible, so unfortunately.\n\n534\n00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:38.170\nAnd then the last one I wanted to\ntalk about is our import options.\n\n535\n00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:43.920\nNow, this is one of those where\nif you are importing contacts,\n\n536\n00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.850\nyou had to have them exported\nfrom somewhere else.\n\n537\n00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:48.060\nOkay so for-\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n538\n00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n539\n00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.520\nAnd the file format that you need to\nhave them in is known as a CSV file.\n\n540\n00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.463\nThe Common Separated Value file.\n\n541\n00:25:56.463 --> 00:25:59.280\nBut let's get through some of them,\ncuz it's actually tells you.\n\n542\n00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.829\nIt's nice it gives you a little tips and\ntricks in there, and\n\n543\n00:26:02.829 --> 00:26:07.362\nnot also remember which folder do I wanna\nbe in and before I input any contact.\n\n544\n00:26:07.362 --> 00:26:11.792\nUnder the main folder, just because,\nand so if I go to Manage,\n\n545\n00:26:11.792 --> 00:26:14.480\nnotice there's an option to import.\n\n546\n00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.630\nThere's also that connect to\nsocial network that we talked\n\n547\n00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:17.960\nabout in the other episode.\n\n548\n00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.980\nImport them.\n\n549\n00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.942\nSo when I click on here, it's like, okay,\nwhere would you like to import them from?\n\n550\n00:26:22.942 --> 00:26:27.360\nBecause they have to come from\nsome other mail program for\n\n551\n00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.540\nyou to be able to import them, as well.\n\n552\n00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.898\nAnd the thing is,\nall of these different mail clients,\n\n553\n00:26:32.898 --> 00:26:37.440\nthey're all gonna have pretty\nmuch the same format, in a sense.\n\n554\n00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.587\nA CSV file is nothing more than\na really an Excel file, columns.\n\n555\n00:26:41.587 --> 00:26:45.230\nI actually have one here\nthat we're gonna work with.\n\n556\n00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:48.750\nI wanted to just show you what it\nlooks like before we get started.\n\n557\n00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:53.950\nIs that, it's just a, like an Excel like\nfile, it's not Excel, it's actually CSV.\n\n558\n00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.697\nBut, see first, last,\n\n559\n00:26:55.697 --> 00:27:01.537\nall of these different columns that we saw\nwhen we were populating our new contact.\n\n560\n00:27:01.537 --> 00:27:05.882\nAnd so, there's our e mail address and so,\nit pretty much follows the same thing,\n\n561\n00:27:05.882 --> 00:27:08.633\nthey all have the same fields,\nas they're called.\n\n562\n00:27:08.633 --> 00:27:11.910\nAnd so, what you're going to do\nis you're going import that.\n\n563\n00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:14.940\nAnd the nice thing is,\nis that here, if like say,\n\n564\n00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:18.830\nhey I have some Gmail contacts that\nI'd like to bring into my Office 365.\n\n565\n00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:22.362\nCool thing is that it's gonna\ngive you some instructions.\n\n566\n00:27:22.362 --> 00:27:25.040\nHey, go to Google, go ahead and export.\n\n567\n00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.550\nYou're gonna get the CSV file, then\nyou're gonna go ahead and come into here.\n\n568\n00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:31.059\nSelect that CSV file, and\nthen go ahead and upload.\n\n569\n00:27:31.059 --> 00:27:35.441\nSo, it's nice that it kinda tells you, and\npretty much is gonna say the same thing,\n\n570\n00:27:35.441 --> 00:27:36.503\nis if like Outlook.\n\n571\n00:27:36.503 --> 00:27:38.401\nNo one to Outlook, go ahead next for it.\n\n572\n00:27:38.401 --> 00:27:39.584\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Bring it in here.\n\n573\n00:27:39.584 --> 00:27:42.693\nBut it's at least showing\nyou the different files, and\n\n574\n00:27:42.693 --> 00:27:46.090\ndifferent places where you have to go,\nso it's kinda nice.\n\n575\n00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:50.436\nThe ones that I have in that CSV\nfile did come from a Gmail account,\n\n576\n00:27:50.436 --> 00:27:53.294\nwas actually from the Chris Kirkpatrick.\n\n577\n00:27:53.294 --> 00:27:56.320\nI made a Chris Kirkpatrick Gmail account.\n\n578\n00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.190\nJust to kind of test things out\nthrough tall these different shows.\n\n579\n00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.781\nAnd so, I know that's where it came from.\n\n580\n00:28:00.781 --> 00:28:03.560\nI go to here,\nI've already exported it, you saw it.\n\n581\n00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.370\nThere's a browse button to\nthe right of this field.\n\n582\n00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:08.510\nIt's behind my head, but\nI promise you it's there.\n\n583\n00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:10.720\nSo it's right there when we click Browse.\n\n584\n00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:15.380\nBut as we come out, I put it on\nmy desktop, there is my contacts.\n\n585\n00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.360\nAnd then I open it, and\n\n586\n00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.030\nthen yep, we want that, notice it\nsays the upload button right there.\n\n587\n00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:26.433\nWe upload and then yay,\nmy upload was successful and perfect.\n\n588\n00:28:26.433 --> 00:28:31.100\nNow, I have Debbie's contact,\nand I have Jordan and Joey's.\n\n589\n00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:35.962\nI got everybody in there that was\nfrom that exported out file from\n\n590\n00:28:35.962 --> 00:28:39.484\nsomewhere into my account and\nthat's great.\n\n591\n00:28:39.484 --> 00:28:43.451\nNow, let's say, you talked about the whole\nlike leaving the company, right?\n\n592\n00:28:43.451 --> 00:28:48.009\nAnd you wanna go ahead and have all of the\ncontacts that you had in your contacts,\n\n593\n00:28:48.009 --> 00:28:49.383\nnot the distribution.\n\n594\n00:28:49.383 --> 00:28:53.850\nNo, global address list, or\nwhat they call directory here.\n\n595\n00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:58.690\nSo you can go ahead and export your\ncontacts to send it to somebody else,\n\n596\n00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:00.912\nor use it for yourself.\n\n597\n00:29:00.912 --> 00:29:04.670\nNotice that you can have all contacts,\nor from specific folders.\n\n598\n00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:08.073\nWe talked about how it can kind\nof sub directory, those things.\n\n599\n00:29:08.073 --> 00:29:13.110\nBut notice one thing, it's not pulling my\npersonal folder, like it just won't let\n\n600\n00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.540\n&gt;&gt; Keeps lock down, doesn't it?\n\n601\n00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.380\n&gt;&gt; It really does,\n\n602\n00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:19.102\nand I don't know if it's because how\nI created it in like a local version.\n\n603\n00:29:19.102 --> 00:29:23.030\nIt's like completely skipping that for\nsome reason.\n\n604\n00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:28.150\nBut notice you can pick other folders, and\nthen go ahead and then, we'll just say all\n\n605\n00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:33.370\ncontacts, export it, and it's noticing,\nit's going to, it's down here.\n\n606\n00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:37.460\nIt went ahead and exported out my folder,\nthey called it contacts as well, and\n\n607\n00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.050\nso there.\n\n608\n00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:40.090\nBut you know,\nthat actually didn't make one point that,\n\n609\n00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:44.510\nlet me just quickly come back around to\nwhat if I wanted to make my own folder?\n\n610\n00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:48.290\nCuz we talked about how to make\na new contact in a folder,\n\n611\n00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:50.780\nbut I didn't show you\nhow to make a folder.\n\n612\n00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:55.080\nSo, you come up to Contacts,\nand we go to New Folder.\n\n613\n00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.132\nWell, I guess I showed this everyone.\n\n614\n00:29:56.132 --> 00:29:58.233\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But we'll go with New Folder, and\n\n615\n00:29:58.233 --> 00:30:01.644\nwe'll go ahead and say, hello,\nand then you hit Enter.\n\n616\n00:30:01.644 --> 00:30:07.952\nAnd then notice that this now is a folder\nthat I have in my directory if you wanna,\n\n617\n00:30:07.952 --> 00:30:12.120\nnot my directory, my contacts,\nyes, there we go.\n\n618\n00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.540\nAnd then I could go ahead and\nuse that, and\n\n619\n00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:20.690\nonce the accounts sinks or whatever,\nit will show, it's right there, see.\n\n620\n00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:22.690\nIt shows up in my local versions, as well.\n\n621\n00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:25.510\nSo, it works the same way.\n\n622\n00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:28.170\nWe just know that we can't drag and\ndrop, or move them.\n\n623\n00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:31.640\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't like to do the drag and\ndrop there in the web app, does it?\n\n624\n00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.908\n&gt;&gt; It does not, no,\nat least at the time of these recording.\n\n625\n00:30:34.908 --> 00:30:35.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n626\n00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:36.720\n&gt;&gt; Gonna keep on saying that.\n\n627\n00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.490\n&gt;&gt; And that's pretty much all I've got.\n\n628\n00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:40.926\nAll the other things in\nOutlook.com are the same there.\n\n629\n00:30:40.926 --> 00:30:44.247\nSo, yeah, that’s how you can\ncreate manager context pretty,\n\n630\n00:30:44.247 --> 00:30:47.570\npretty straight,\nI would call it somewhat straight forward.\n\n631\n00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:50.114\n[SOUND] Somewhat straight forward,\nif I can go ahead, and\n\n632\n00:30:50.114 --> 00:30:51.227\nget that out of my mouth.\n\n633\n00:30:51.227 --> 00:30:54.673\n[LAUGH] But now you know how to do it,\nand hopefully you can go ahead and\n\n634\n00:30:54.673 --> 00:30:57.532\npopulate your address book,\nand feel really popular.\n\n635\n00:30:57.532 --> 00:31:01.454\n&gt;&gt; That’s right, and\nknowing how to do this will actually kind,\n\n636\n00:31:01.454 --> 00:31:06.043\nto me kind of jumps back to that\norganizing and customizing kind of thing.\n\n637\n00:31:06.043 --> 00:31:08.008\nCuz you're kind of organizing things, and\n\n638\n00:31:08.008 --> 00:31:11.740\nmaking sure everything's there that you\nneed, so that you could create an email.\n\n639\n00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.540\nIt goes right to the person\nyou know exactly\n\n640\n00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:14.790\nthat all their information is correct.\n\n641\n00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:17.630\nYou don't have to worry about it,\ncuz you know you created that contact.\n\n642\n00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:20.950\nIt's there, you just need to use\nit whenever you're ready for it.\n\n643\n00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:24.569\nNow, thanks to Vonne, we know all the\nmultitude of ways in which we can do that,\n\n644\n00:31:24.569 --> 00:31:25.334\nwork with them.\n\n645\n00:31:25.334 --> 00:31:29.924\nHow they're different, if you're\nworking inside of a directory structure\n\n646\n00:31:29.924 --> 00:31:32.966\nversus a personal style of environments,\nright?\n\n647\n00:31:32.966 --> 00:31:36.520\nSo just be aware of those differences,\nso you don't get confused.\n\n648\n00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.820\nI know it's hard to do.\n\n649\n00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.453\nWe'll take our Microsoft medicine and\ndo what they say, but\n\n650\n00:31:40.453 --> 00:31:41.674\nwhat you're gonna do, right?\n\n651\n00:31:41.674 --> 00:31:43.504\nWell, thanks so much for\nshowing us this stuff today.\n\n652\n00:31:43.504 --> 00:31:46.310\nW appreciate it, all your time and\neffort you put into this.\n\n653\n00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:48.033\nI know that you worked\nreally hard on this episode.\n\n654\n00:31:48.033 --> 00:31:51.300\nFor our good viewers out there to\nbenefit from, hopefully you did.\n\n655\n00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.870\nIt does look like we are coming\nto the end of this episode.\n\n656\n00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:55.350\nWe're all out of time.\n\n657\n00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:57.970\nSigning off for OFFICEPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n658\n00:31:57.970 --> 00:31:58.610\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Von Smith.\n\n659\n00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:59.800\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n660\n00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.336\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:33.879\nYes, we're on that Outlook train.\n\n14\n00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.161\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; It's like you're on it with us, so.\n\n15\n00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:37.272\n&gt;&gt; Choo choo.\n\n16\n00:00:37.272 --> 00:00:39.677\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's go.\n\n17\n00:00:39.677 --> 00:00:44.057\n[LAUGH] So\nwe are moving on to the calendar in our\n\n18\n00:00:44.057 --> 00:00:48.801\nOutlook on the Web [CROSSTALK]\nthat way too right?\n\n19\n00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:50.231\n&gt;&gt; Totally messed you up,\nI got inside your head.\n\n20\n00:00:50.231 --> 00:00:51.048\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n\n21\n00:00:51.048 --> 00:00:54.959\nI know, it's like okay well we are in for\naround the web we are here and\n\n22\n00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:56.183\nit's all good, so.\n\n23\n00:00:56.183 --> 00:00:57.239\n&gt;&gt; For what ever purposes in your life.\n\n24\n00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.031\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n25\n00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:00.417\nSo what do we do with our calendar?\n\n26\n00:01:00.417 --> 00:01:03.191\nIt's, well a lot of us lived by.\n\n27\n00:01:03.191 --> 00:01:04.542\nWhat am I doing today?\n\n28\n00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:05.886\nWhat type of meetings do I have?\n\n29\n00:01:05.886 --> 00:01:07.916\nWhat do I've scheduled here and there?\n\n30\n00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:09.868\nI need to know where I'm supposed to be.\n\n31\n00:01:09.868 --> 00:01:14.519\nSo I know some people that are just like,\nthey're just like tied to their calendar.\n\n32\n00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:16.471\nThey put everything on their calendar.\n\n33\n00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:19.692\nYou know, when to feed the cats,\nwhen to go to the grocery store.\n\n34\n00:01:19.692 --> 00:01:22.425\nOkay, maybe I'm getting\na little overzealous there, but\n\n35\n00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:24.620\nthat's what we're going\nto be talking about.\n\n36\n00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.260\nAnd we're gonna just explore\nthe interface first,\n\n37\n00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.205\njust like we've done in all of\nour other areas of Outlook.\n\n38\n00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:33.534\nIt just like, let's just get familiar\nwith it before we start creating them and\n\n39\n00:01:33.534 --> 00:01:34.138\neverything.\n\n40\n00:01:34.138 --> 00:01:37.960\nSo let's know what's that thing on\nthe left, what is that thing on the right?\n\n41\n00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.243\nWhat happens if I single\nclick versus double click?\n\n42\n00:01:40.243 --> 00:01:42.009\nSo we're gonna cover all of those.\n\n43\n00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.576\nSo while I go ahead and just get\nstarted right from how do you even\n\n44\n00:01:45.576 --> 00:01:49.292\nget to the Calendar, well,\nI've signed into Joey's account.\n\n45\n00:01:49.292 --> 00:01:53.639\nAnd just like we saw with the people,\nif I wanted to access the calendar,\n\n46\n00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:55.717\nI can go right from this main menu.\n\n47\n00:01:55.717 --> 00:02:00.841\nAnd it will jump into\nthe calendar area of Outlook.\n\n48\n00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:03.793\nBut we also know,\nif you've seen previous episodes,\n\n49\n00:02:03.793 --> 00:02:07.589\nthat we have the little mini-navigation\nbar down at the bottom left.\n\n50\n00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:11.754\nSo if you were already in Mail you\ncould just click down at the bottom for\n\n51\n00:02:11.754 --> 00:02:14.519\nthe calendar and\nthen jump right over to here.\n\n52\n00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.908\nSo I've been making some different\nthings in the calendar to give us\n\n53\n00:02:18.908 --> 00:02:21.455\nsomething to have before we get going.\n\n54\n00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:25.957\nSo our basic structure of what we're\nlooking at here is we have some stuff on\n\n55\n00:02:25.957 --> 00:02:27.605\nthe left, this left pane.\n\n56\n00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:31.685\nWe've been calling this the older pane for\na lot of times when we're in our mail of\n\n57\n00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:34.989\nwhat we had Inbox and our Sent\ntimes deleted and all those things.\n\n58\n00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.149\nAnd when we have the Calendars,\nwell, then you have your calendars.\n\n59\n00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:40.333\n[LAUGH] That right?\n\n60\n00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:41.923\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, imagine that, Daniel.\n\n61\n00:02:41.923 --> 00:02:44.215\n&gt;&gt; Who would have thought that\nyou put an actual calendar,\n\n62\n00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:46.036\none of the labelled\nthings as the Calendar?\n\n63\n00:02:46.036 --> 00:02:48.269\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I know, it's so crazy.\n\n64\n00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.533\n[LAUGH] So it's,\nwe have right here we have your calendars,\n\n65\n00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:52.852\nI also have some other.\n\n66\n00:02:52.852 --> 00:02:56.159\nSo, because I have quite a few\ndifferent things going on here.\n\n67\n00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.471\nSo if you don't see everything that I do,\nwell, by the end of the episode,\n\n68\n00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:01.321\nyou'll have just as much as I will, too.\n\n69\n00:03:01.321 --> 00:03:03.158\n[LAUGH] So the left-hand side,\n\n70\n00:03:03.158 --> 00:03:07.962\nthis is where it just shows you the month\nview of wherever you're at at all times,\n\n71\n00:03:07.962 --> 00:03:11.655\nand like I said, the other\ncalendars that you have access to.\n\n72\n00:03:11.655 --> 00:03:16.098\nIn the main area,\nwe'll just call this the middle area or\n\n73\n00:03:16.098 --> 00:03:21.947\nthe main calendar is like whatever view\nthat your calendar is in right now.\n\n74\n00:03:21.947 --> 00:03:24.027\nRight now this is in a month view.\n\n75\n00:03:24.027 --> 00:03:27.537\nBut if we kinda go towards the top\nwe have a couple different places.\n\n76\n00:03:27.537 --> 00:03:29.724\nWe have like,\nwell let's go over here to the right,\n\n77\n00:03:29.724 --> 00:03:31.277\nsince I'm talking about that view.\n\n78\n00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:35.144\nThese are different view buttons,\nlike do I want to view it by date, or\n\n79\n00:03:35.144 --> 00:03:36.665\nwanna view it by work week?\n\n80\n00:03:36.665 --> 00:03:38.482\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead click on it for\nyou right now.\n\n81\n00:03:38.482 --> 00:03:40.746\nIt's like this is my day view.\n\n82\n00:03:40.746 --> 00:03:45.666\nSo it's showing me, there's that little\ndotted line that's letting me know\n\n83\n00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:48.959\nat what time that I'm at right now and\nwhere I'm in.\n\n84\n00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.339\nSo you can see that on my schedule today,\n\n85\n00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:56.316\nI had a ladies' lunch at 12 o' clock that\nwas really fun to run through the rain in.\n\n86\n00:03:56.316 --> 00:03:56.991\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n87\n00:03:56.991 --> 00:03:59.722\n&gt;&gt; No, [LAUGH] my shoes are still wet.\n\n88\n00:03:59.722 --> 00:04:02.785\nAnd then we have, look,\nour Outlook calendar show.\n\n89\n00:04:02.785 --> 00:04:03.490\n&gt;&gt; Hey!\n\n90\n00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.136\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\n&gt;&gt; That's happening now, actually.\n\n91\n00:04:05.136 --> 00:04:05.958\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n92\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:10.239\n[LAUGH] So you can see that I have\nthis on my schedule for today, and\n\n93\n00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.983\nI changed the view from these\nlittle buttons over here.\n\n94\n00:04:13.983 --> 00:04:15.142\nClick on work week.\n\n95\n00:04:15.142 --> 00:04:18.794\nWell, my work week goes\nfrom Monday to Friday.\n\n96\n00:04:18.794 --> 00:04:22.591\nWell, maybe your work week goes\nfrom Saturday to Thursday.\n\n97\n00:04:22.591 --> 00:04:23.893\nThat's okay, we can change it.\n\n98\n00:04:23.893 --> 00:04:27.519\nI'm going to go into the Settings in\nthis episode as well towards the end.\n\n99\n00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:31.231\nAnd then the week would be the entire\nweek, if it starts on a Sunday.\n\n100\n00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:32.501\nYou could change that, too.\n\n101\n00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:34.538\nAnd then the month view\nwhere it's got the month.\n\n102\n00:04:34.538 --> 00:04:39.004\nI tend to like the month view just\nbecause I usually don't have so\n\n103\n00:04:39.004 --> 00:04:43.734\nmany things during the day that I\nneeded to see them in that day view.\n\n104\n00:04:43.734 --> 00:04:47.710\nBut some people have appointments and\nmeetings all the way through the entire\n\n105\n00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.355\nday so that might be something\nthat they need to do.\n\n106\n00:04:50.355 --> 00:04:55.775\nBut in this month view, just to show\nyou that at the time of this recording,\n\n107\n00:04:55.775 --> 00:04:57.510\nit is Aug 18th [LAUGH].\n\n108\n00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.812\nAnd you can see that it has a little\nplot like a two plus down here.\n\n109\n00:05:02.812 --> 00:05:07.529\nThat's indicating to me that I have,\nwell, two more things that it will not be\n\n110\n00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:11.182\nable to show me in this month\nview because there's just not-\n\n111\n00:05:11.182 --> 00:05:11.773\n&gt;&gt; Just not enough room.\n\n112\n00:05:11.773 --> 00:05:13.618\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, there's not enough space.\n\n113\n00:05:13.618 --> 00:05:18.130\nSo if you ever see that,\nthat's why if you're in the month view.\n\n114\n00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.422\nAnd we'll go over some other\nthings that are in these icons but\n\n115\n00:05:21.422 --> 00:05:24.542\nlet's just keep what like\nthe basic structure right now.\n\n116\n00:05:24.542 --> 00:05:26.497\nWe come over here to the right,\n\n117\n00:05:26.497 --> 00:05:31.249\nwell then we have the details of whatever\nI have selected, which is today.\n\n118\n00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:35.884\nAnd you can see that it's giving me kind\nof a quick list view of all of the items\n\n119\n00:05:35.884 --> 00:05:37.271\nthat I have for today.\n\n120\n00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:38.115\nBut I did forget,\n\n121\n00:05:38.115 --> 00:05:41.337\ncuz I'm like look up here at the top\nbefore we went over to the right.\n\n122\n00:05:41.337 --> 00:05:43.619\nI went over here to the Views.\n\n123\n00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:45.977\nThen you also have these right here.\n\n124\n00:05:45.977 --> 00:05:49.773\nWe have that it's showing me\nthat it's August 2017, and\n\n125\n00:05:49.773 --> 00:05:54.664\nthen me have some buttons that go back and\nforth that will let me navigate through\n\n126\n00:05:54.664 --> 00:05:58.025\nthose different months or\nweeks and so on and so forth.\n\n127\n00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:00.638\nWe'll come back and click them\na little bit more in just a second.\n\n128\n00:06:00.638 --> 00:06:04.804\nBut all the way up here we have our,\nI'm calling the Menu bar,\n\n129\n00:06:04.804 --> 00:06:08.830\nwhere we have new,\ninteresting calendar share and print.\n\n130\n00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.543\nAnd we'll go over all of these as well.\n\n131\n00:06:10.543 --> 00:06:15.188\nBut those are your main sides, left side,\nmiddle side, right side and top side.\n\n132\n00:06:15.188 --> 00:06:16.328\nOkay, cool.\n&gt;&gt; Interesting calendar,\n\n133\n00:06:16.328 --> 00:06:17.182\nseems really subjective.\n\n134\n00:06:17.182 --> 00:06:20.724\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, yeah, well.\n\n135\n00:06:20.724 --> 00:06:22.965\nThey're interesting to me,\nbecause you know what?\n\n136\n00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:24.236\nWhy don't we go there, Daniel?\n\n137\n00:06:24.236 --> 00:06:24.768\n&gt;&gt; Go ahead.\n\n138\n00:06:24.768 --> 00:06:29.451\n&gt;&gt; Why don't we say like cuz I have\nadded an interesting calendar for me.\n\n139\n00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:33.035\n&gt;&gt; So we define what calendars\nare interesting, not Outlook.\n\n140\n00:06:33.035 --> 00:06:35.605\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthey give us a choice of what they think-\n\n141\n00:06:35.605 --> 00:06:36.757\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n142\n00:06:36.757 --> 00:06:38.428\n&gt;&gt; We would think is interesting.\n\n143\n00:06:38.428 --> 00:06:39.235\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n144\n00:06:39.235 --> 00:06:40.636\nthese computers never get involved.\n\n145\n00:06:40.636 --> 00:06:42.987\n&gt;&gt; No, no, so here, let's go there.\n\n146\n00:06:42.987 --> 00:06:46.419\nIf I click on Interesting Calendars,\nit's gonna bring up, and\n\n147\n00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:50.816\nthis is like connected to Microsoft and\nthis is going to Bing, our search engine.\n\n148\n00:06:50.816 --> 00:06:51.797\nAnd, hey.\n\n149\n00:06:51.797 --> 00:06:53.835\nAre you interested in sports?\n\n150\n00:06:53.835 --> 00:06:56.215\nWhat sport are you interested in?\n\n151\n00:06:56.215 --> 00:06:58.155\nHow about-\n&gt;&gt; You're a bit of a hockey fan.\n\n152\n00:06:58.155 --> 00:06:59.659\n&gt;&gt; I am, yeah.\n\n153\n00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:02.400\nAnd if you could tell what's\nover here to the left?\n\n154\n00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.308\n&gt;&gt; Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\n155\n00:07:03.308 --> 00:07:04.512\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n156\n00:07:04.512 --> 00:07:08.276\nSo if I was going to ice hockey,\nit's funny that they have the KHL.\n\n157\n00:07:08.276 --> 00:07:08.866\nI thought that was pretty cool.\n\n158\n00:07:08.866 --> 00:07:09.703\n&gt;&gt; KHL, yeah, it is cool.\n\n159\n00:07:09.703 --> 00:07:13.250\n&gt;&gt; So, we have the NHL, and\nthen we have, I can't pick anybody but\n\n160\n00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.355\nthe Tampa Bay Lightning, but you can\nsee that I already have it selected.\n\n161\n00:07:17.355 --> 00:07:21.035\n&gt;&gt; I do enjoy the Rangers.\n\n162\n00:07:21.035 --> 00:07:23.346\n&gt;&gt; They're kind of like my second team,\nbecause I have so\n\n163\n00:07:23.346 --> 00:07:24.764\nmany people who live in New York.\n\n164\n00:07:24.764 --> 00:07:28.501\nI've been to quite a few Ranger games,\nbut they're a huge rival for us.\n\n165\n00:07:28.501 --> 00:07:29.152\n&gt;&gt; They are.\n\n166\n00:07:29.152 --> 00:07:31.275\n&gt;&gt; Us,\nlike I play on the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\n167\n00:07:31.275 --> 00:07:32.416\nI love it when people say that.\n\n168\n00:07:32.416 --> 00:07:33.237\nI play hockey.\n\n169\n00:07:33.237 --> 00:07:34.251\n&gt;&gt; You were great last season, Vonne.\n\n170\n00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:35.595\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, right?\n\n171\n00:07:35.595 --> 00:07:37.169\n&gt;&gt; You really cheered them on good.\n\n172\n00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:40.348\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nyou can see that I've got that.\n\n173\n00:07:40.348 --> 00:07:42.446\nSo yes, I could follow it but\nnow it's like,\n\n174\n00:07:42.446 --> 00:07:46.105\nI think it would be almost sacrilegious\nfor me to go ahead and put them on there.\n\n175\n00:07:46.105 --> 00:07:47.573\nSo we're just gonna keep\nwith the Lightning.\n\n176\n00:07:47.573 --> 00:07:48.555\nGonna be a great season.\n\n177\n00:07:48.555 --> 00:07:52.737\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I have it to where I've added this\n\n178\n00:07:52.737 --> 00:07:57.958\nas one of my calendars that I would\nlike to see different dates on.\n\n179\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.060\nSo I'm gonna close this, and\n\n180\n00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.630\nwhy don't we just jump on over here,\nsince we're talking about it?\n\n181\n00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.484\nAnd notice that I have multiple\ncalendars that I can look at.\n\n182\n00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:08.210\nAnd right now, this is my calendar, right.\n\n183\n00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:13.220\nThis is the calendar for Joey Fatone\nright here, and notice the color coding.\n\n184\n00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.204\nSo watch when I turn on.\n\n185\n00:08:14.204 --> 00:08:18.284\nAll I gotta do is click on the left\nhand side for Tampa Bay Lightning, and\n\n186\n00:08:18.284 --> 00:08:21.752\nit brings up another calendar over here,\nalmost like tabs,\n\n187\n00:08:21.752 --> 00:08:24.030\nkinda like tabs on our browser.\n\n188\n00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.681\nSo if I wanted to jump over here to Tampa\nBay Lightning, it's like, didn't do it.\n\n189\n00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:28.990\nThey overlay each other.\n\n190\n00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.699\nSo it's like,\nyou're baseless in everything.\n\n191\n00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:32.827\nNow right now,\nwe're not in hockey season right now.\n\n192\n00:08:32.827 --> 00:08:33.802\n&gt;&gt; Right, so there's nothing?\n\n193\n00:08:33.802 --> 00:08:37.522\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but preseason is coming up very\nsoon, so why don't we go ahead and\n\n194\n00:08:37.522 --> 00:08:38.454\ndo a navigation.\n\n195\n00:08:38.454 --> 00:08:40.476\nWe can use this arrow to the left.\n\n196\n00:08:40.476 --> 00:08:41.952\nThat would be the other left,\nthat will be the right.\n\n197\n00:08:41.952 --> 00:08:43.212\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n198\n00:08:43.212 --> 00:08:47.028\nif I jump over to the next month,\nnow you can start seeing it.\n\n199\n00:08:47.028 --> 00:08:51.220\nYou will see these are the pre-season\ngames that happen in September.\n\n200\n00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.130\nBut opening night is actually October 6th,\nyes I have tickets.\n\n201\n00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:59.995\nSo that's going to be the start of the\nofficial season of hockey, right there.\n\n202\n00:08:59.995 --> 00:09:04.987\nBut now you can see that the orange,\nthe orange is the default color of\n\n203\n00:09:04.987 --> 00:09:09.134\nJoey's calendar, and\nthe Tampa Bay Lightning is blue.\n\n204\n00:09:09.134 --> 00:09:11.486\nWell actually, I think I made it blue.\n\n205\n00:09:11.486 --> 00:09:13.302\n&gt;&gt; No, you made it blue.\n\n206\n00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:17.443\n&gt;&gt; So now you see the overlay that's going\non here, and you can switch back and\n\n207\n00:09:17.443 --> 00:09:17.969\nforth and\n\n208\n00:09:17.969 --> 00:09:20.464\nit almost kind of puts more of the focus-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n209\n00:09:20.464 --> 00:09:22.745\nmore emphasis on one color than the other,\nlets you choose one more.\n\n210\n00:09:22.745 --> 00:09:27.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, mm-hm, and if I click over\non the blue now, the blue turns on.\n\n211\n00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:31.600\nThese are all very light colors,\nso it might be kinda hard to see.\n\n212\n00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.762\nBut there is the overlay.\n\n213\n00:09:33.762 --> 00:09:38.016\nAnd if I wanted to like turn my calendar\noff, I can either click this, like,\n\n214\n00:09:38.016 --> 00:09:39.890\nright up here, so your little X.\n\n215\n00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.026\nCan turn that off to just show the\ninteresting calendar that I had added for\n\n216\n00:09:44.026 --> 00:09:44.700\nTampa Bay.\n\n217\n00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.690\nIf I wanna bring back up my calendar,\nthen I just click on it right over there,\n\n218\n00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.930\nor I can also click on and\noff from this menu right here.\n\n219\n00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.915\nSo that's what you've got going\non with multiple calendars.\n\n220\n00:09:55.915 --> 00:09:58.926\nAnd the colors, that's what I\nwanted to come back around to.\n\n221\n00:09:58.926 --> 00:10:03.926\nI had it orange for mine, but if you\nright click over on the calendar list in\n\n222\n00:10:03.926 --> 00:10:09.220\nthe left pane, notice that I can change\nwhat all default colors come in.\n\n223\n00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:13.460\nI can make my calendar be pink and that,\nor I guess yeah, we'll call that pink.\n\n224\n00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.600\n&gt;&gt; It goes a little better actually.\n\n225\n00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.186\nYeah, right?\n\n226\n00:10:15.186 --> 00:10:19.930\nYeah, and so like Tampa Bay Lightning,\nto me they can't be any color but blue, so\n\n227\n00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.340\nthat's what we've got going on there.\n\n228\n00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.150\nBut that is the color coding\nthat happens right there, and\n\n229\n00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.260\nyou can change that if you want to.\n\n230\n00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.460\nSo I'm gonna turn off\nthe Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\n231\n00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.660\nCome over here to color.\n\n232\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.050\n&gt;&gt; What do you have more calendars\nthan they have colors in there?\n\n233\n00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.551\nSo you have ten calendars instead of nine?\n\n234\n00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:38.046\nWell then,\nyou'd have to start remembering by name.\n\n235\n00:10:38.046 --> 00:10:41.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a lot of calendars.\n\n236\n00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.810\nI mean it's totally feasible.\n\n237\n00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:45.850\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure there's like a personal\nassistant out there with 9,000 calendars\n\n238\n00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:46.610\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure yes.\n\n239\n00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.274\nSo, those are all and\nthe colors as they give me.\n\n240\n00:10:50.274 --> 00:10:52.412\nSo, all right, we got nine.\n\n241\n00:10:52.412 --> 00:10:55.373\n&gt;&gt; I thought that was interesting and\ntypically they give you like a color wheel\n\n242\n00:10:55.373 --> 00:10:57.882\nor something, and you can just\ncustomize and make your colors.\n\n243\n00:10:57.882 --> 00:10:58.777\nI hear they didn't do that.\n\n244\n00:10:58.777 --> 00:11:01.148\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; They gave you nine pastels and said,\n\n245\n00:11:01.148 --> 00:11:02.129\nenjoy the Easter.\n\n246\n00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:03.488\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n247\n00:11:03.488 --> 00:11:07.170\nyou're now kinda stumping me, I'm like-\n&gt;&gt; What would happen?\n\n248\n00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.707\nI guess they would-\n&gt;&gt; Not probably over used, so.\n\n249\n00:11:08.707 --> 00:11:09.659\n&gt;&gt; Just have two or three blues.\n\n250\n00:11:09.659 --> 00:11:14.199\nYeah, so just re-use them,\nso, I guess, [LAUGH] cool.\n\n251\n00:11:14.199 --> 00:11:17.516\nNow where we're at,\nlet's go back over here to today.\n\n252\n00:11:17.516 --> 00:11:20.140\nSo up among these buttons,\nthis is where I could change my view,\n\n253\n00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.440\neven though I'm in the month view,\nI can jump back over to what day it is.\n\n254\n00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.730\nBecause notice that I said well all of the\nJoey calendars are all gonna be pink now.\n\n255\n00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.460\nWell, that's yellow,\nthat's red, that's purple, why?\n\n256\n00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:38.184\nBecause you can use categories to\nmark up your different meetings.\n\n257\n00:11:38.184 --> 00:11:41.071\nAnd that's to me,\nlike when you start getting in calendars,\n\n258\n00:11:41.071 --> 00:11:43.650\nthat's where I really like the categories.\n\n259\n00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:47.166\nTo say like blue means I'm\nmeeting with the boss-\n\n260\n00:11:47.166 --> 00:11:48.168\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Staff meeting,\n\n261\n00:11:48.168 --> 00:11:50.135\nquarterly staff meeting or\nwhatever, boom, blue.\n\n262\n00:11:50.135 --> 00:11:55.486\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and to me I feel, If you're\ngonna start using your categories,\n\n263\n00:11:55.486 --> 00:12:01.300\nkinda start with the calendar to determine\nlike, green is going to be this.\n\n264\n00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.720\nAnd then your emails kinda match with it.\n\n265\n00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.846\nJust because I feel to me, that\nthe calendar coloring, the categorizing,\n\n266\n00:12:07.846 --> 00:12:11.783\nthis is where it could really come\ninto play, when I'm looking at this.\n\n267\n00:12:11.783 --> 00:12:13.605\nSo I can look really quickly at,\n\n268\n00:12:13.605 --> 00:12:16.651\nlike what each one of my\nmeetings is going to be about.\n\n269\n00:12:16.651 --> 00:12:19.734\nAll right, so\nthat's what we've got going on here,\n\n270\n00:12:19.734 --> 00:12:23.170\nso assigned a category to\nthese different things.\n\n271\n00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:24.955\nSo now, we know about what the colors are.\n\n272\n00:12:24.955 --> 00:12:29.031\nThese little guys right here,\ncuz you could see that right there, well,\n\n273\n00:12:29.031 --> 00:12:33.714\nthat's indicating that yeah, we're kinda\nhaving some thunderstorms around us.\n\n274\n00:12:33.714 --> 00:12:34.546\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n275\n00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:35.221\n&gt;&gt; Is this letting us know about our\n\n276\n00:12:35.221 --> 00:12:36.281\nweather?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.\n\n277\n00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:36.969\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool actually.\n\n278\n00:12:36.969 --> 00:12:39.801\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can add a weather to this,\nand this is part of the settings where\n\n279\n00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:42.940\nit's like you've turned on, yeah,\ngo ahead and show me the weather.\n\n280\n00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.790\nAnd so that's where it's kinda giving me\nthose little icons, right on over there.\n\n281\n00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.511\n&gt;&gt; And is that in a real time obviously?\n\n282\n00:12:48.511 --> 00:12:49.063\nRight, yes?\n\n283\n00:12:49.063 --> 00:12:53.125\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because it was sunny this morning,\nand it's not anymore.\n\n284\n00:12:53.125 --> 00:12:56.305\n[LAUGH] So yeah, it does kinda go,\njust like with your weather apps, and\n\n285\n00:12:56.305 --> 00:12:57.367\neverything like that.\n\n286\n00:12:57.367 --> 00:12:59.999\n&gt;&gt; Just basically just kinda\nmaking those two things combine.\n\n287\n00:12:59.999 --> 00:13:00.524\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n288\n00:13:00.524 --> 00:13:02.360\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty cool.\n\n289\n00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:06.830\nAnd then the other, talking about icons,\nnotice that we have these little charms.\n\n290\n00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.278\nWe talked about charms, with,\nI think with the contacts and\n\n291\n00:13:09.278 --> 00:13:11.690\neverything, or\nsomewhere around with our, doh, tasks.\n\n292\n00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:12.920\nThat's what we did.\n\n293\n00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.717\nSo we have some charms right there.\n\n294\n00:13:14.717 --> 00:13:16.778\nI put like a little coffee cup for\nthe lunch,\n\n295\n00:13:16.778 --> 00:13:18.890\nand the outlook show with our camera.\n\n296\n00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.432\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, little cute stuff.\n\n297\n00:13:20.432 --> 00:13:24.551\nAnd I don't know if you notice,\nsomewhere in the middle there,\n\n298\n00:13:24.551 --> 00:13:29.831\nthere was like an alert, or like a hey,\nguess what, cuz I put a hello at 3:30.\n\n299\n00:13:29.831 --> 00:13:33.933\nAnd there's actually up here,\nthere's my notifications.\n\n300\n00:13:33.933 --> 00:13:38.556\nA kinda hey, guess what, you need to say\nhello at 3:30 to 4, and now I have the,\n\n301\n00:13:38.556 --> 00:13:40.852\nit's kinda like the whole snooze thing.\n\n302\n00:13:40.852 --> 00:13:44.410\nIt's like hey,\nyou've got something going on.\n\n303\n00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:46.531\nJust like we have our stand\nup every morning, and\n\n304\n00:13:46.531 --> 00:13:48.880\nI have an alert that says hey,\nIt's time to stand up.\n\n305\n00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.615\nBut everybody stands up around us,\nso I know it's gonna happen.\n\n306\n00:13:50.615 --> 00:13:54.586\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Those are your notifications that\n\n307\n00:13:54.586 --> 00:13:55.506\nhappen there.\n\n308\n00:13:55.506 --> 00:13:58.624\nAll right, so\nwe've got the reminders are whether,\n\n309\n00:13:58.624 --> 00:14:01.891\nlet's come back over a little bit more for\nnavigation.\n\n310\n00:14:01.891 --> 00:14:04.172\nWe've been talking about\nhow we can turn on or\n\n311\n00:14:04.172 --> 00:14:06.282\noff different calendars from down here.\n\n312\n00:14:06.282 --> 00:14:08.930\nWe also saw these little\nbuttons up at the top.\n\n313\n00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.626\nThis drop down next to August,\n\n314\n00:14:10.626 --> 00:14:14.426\nthis is where if I wanted to jump to\na specific month within this year.\n\n315\n00:14:14.426 --> 00:14:17.601\nThat's kinda nice, but\nthen you have this guy over here.\n\n316\n00:14:17.601 --> 00:14:21.632\nNow if I click the little buttons like\nleft and right, notice that our main part\n\n317\n00:14:21.632 --> 00:14:25.563\nof what we're supposed to look at\ndoesn't change when I use these buttons.\n\n318\n00:14:25.563 --> 00:14:27.970\nSo that's where it's like,\nhmm, let me go head back.\n\n319\n00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:28.650\nWhen was it?\n\n320\n00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:33.800\nI think it was about April, and then once\nyou click on a day within the calendar,\n\n321\n00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.380\nthen it actually jumps over\ninto the main section to,\n\n322\n00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.260\nthat's where you want to navigate.\n\n323\n00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.285\nAs opposed to these buttons here,\nyou see it is actually jumping, and\n\n324\n00:14:43.285 --> 00:14:46.505\nbecause I'm in the month\nview it's jumping by months.\n\n325\n00:14:46.505 --> 00:14:49.997\nIf I was in the week view and\nI start using these buttons,\n\n326\n00:14:49.997 --> 00:14:53.859\nsee it's gonna jump by week, so\nit all depends on which view,\n\n327\n00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:58.043\nlike what increment I would say,\nthat you're jumping around to.\n\n328\n00:14:58.043 --> 00:15:03.394\nBut this does not move\nthe focus if you wanna say.\n\n329\n00:15:03.394 --> 00:15:05.902\nAnd what you're seeing\nin the main section,\n\n330\n00:15:05.902 --> 00:15:09.336\nwhen you're bouncing around over\nhere on the left hand side.\n\n331\n00:15:09.336 --> 00:15:10.804\nBut the nice thing is like, wow,\n\n332\n00:15:10.804 --> 00:15:13.540\nI don't even know where I'm at\nanymore within the calendar.\n\n333\n00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.600\nCan we just go back to where it is today?\n\n334\n00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.148\nYou click today, all right, perfect.\n\n335\n00:15:17.148 --> 00:15:20.410\nLet's go back to that month view, because\nthat's what I'm most comfortable with.\n\n336\n00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:24.840\nAnd that's how we can go ahead and\nstart navigating around.\n\n337\n00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.420\nAll right, so\nlet's talk about some other calendars.\n\n338\n00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.890\nNow we've already talked a little bit\nabout the Tampa Bay Lightning calendar\n\n339\n00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:37.330\nthat I added as an interesting calendar,\nthat Bing let me so graciously add.\n\n340\n00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.540\nAnd then there is some other ones,\nyou see there's a birthdays calendar.\n\n341\n00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:45.123\nSo if I click on Birthdays, and\nthen I'm gonna turn off my other calendar.\n\n342\n00:15:45.123 --> 00:15:50.171\nSo you can see that we have\na Kimber Cats birthday on August 30th,\n\n343\n00:15:50.171 --> 00:15:54.967\nand then we also have\nbirthday down September 15th.\n\n344\n00:15:54.967 --> 00:15:57.123\nActually his birthday is in June.\n\n345\n00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.020\nI just put it on for the show.\n\n346\n00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.155\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no,\n\n347\n00:16:00.155 --> 00:16:03.275\ncuz I was texting my husband\nwhen's Fuego's birthday?\n\n348\n00:16:03.275 --> 00:16:05.184\nHe actually has it in his phone, but-\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n349\n00:16:05.184 --> 00:16:07.226\nShows how much you care about your cats.\n\n350\n00:16:07.226 --> 00:16:08.396\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, yeah.\n\n351\n00:16:08.396 --> 00:16:09.142\nSo, I checked.\n\n352\n00:16:09.142 --> 00:16:11.561\nHe just texted me back right\nbefore the show, he's like sorry.\n\n353\n00:16:11.561 --> 00:16:15.070\nI'm like okay, that's cool.\n\n354\n00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.200\nAnyways, so\nwe've got there some different birthdays.\n\n355\n00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.910\nNow, this is another one of those\nspecial calendars that you can\n\n356\n00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:23.910\nadd in your settings.\n\n357\n00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.630\nI didn't make this.\n\n358\n00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:26.210\nI just said yeah,\n\n359\n00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:30.740\nturn on the birthday calendars, and\nthen I added them from within here.\n\n360\n00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.630\nThe same with the holidays.\n\n361\n00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:36.000\nThe holidays is another one of those\ncalendars that I actually added from\n\n362\n00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.690\nthe local version.\n\n363\n00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.440\nSo I said, yeah, turn on the holidays so\n\n364\n00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.780\nI can see them, like the American\nholidays, and then we can go from there.\n\n365\n00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:47.000\nSo we can see all of our different\ncategories by turning them on and off.\n\n366\n00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.830\nWe know about the color coding, and\nwe know how to turn them on and\n\n367\n00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:53.520\noff of what we want to\nsee in the main area.\n\n368\n00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.060\nNow, there's also going to be we wanna\ntalk about sharing calendars and\n\n369\n00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:57.890\nhow all that works.\n\n370\n00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.600\nI have a whole other episode for that.\n\n371\n00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.050\nBut you might see some,\nlike I see other calendars.\n\n372\n00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.155\nI can see Justin's.\n\n373\n00:17:04.155 --> 00:17:08.880\nWell, that's because Justin and\nJoey are on OfficePro Democo together.\n\n374\n00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:15.300\nSo you can actually request to open other\npeople's calendar within your network.\n\n375\n00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.600\nYou don't even have to ask permission, but\n\n376\n00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.450\nthat's because you're not doing\nanything with their calendar.\n\n377\n00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:23.350\nAll you're doing is seeing it.\n\n378\n00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:26.163\nYou can't change anything,\nyou can't open anything.\n\n379\n00:17:26.163 --> 00:17:27.444\nBut you get to view it.\n\n380\n00:17:27.444 --> 00:17:30.149\nSo on the same network you could come up,\nand actually, here,\n\n381\n00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:31.536\nI'll just show you how I did it.\n\n382\n00:17:31.536 --> 00:17:35.840\nYou can say Add Calendar\nfrom the directory.\n\n383\n00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.845\nAnd then if I type in the person's name\nwithin the directory, it will add.\n\n384\n00:17:39.845 --> 00:17:43.565\nThat is not the same as actually sharing,\n\n385\n00:17:43.565 --> 00:17:48.500\ngiving permission of your\ncalendar to somebody else.\n\n386\n00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.950\nIt's a view only versus\nbeing able to control.\n\n387\n00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:55.100\nSo wanted to throw that out there for you.\n\n388\n00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.070\nAnd then, you also have some groups.\n\n389\n00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.210\nWe've talked,\nwe've kinda touched on groups here and\n\n390\n00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.740\nthere in some other episodes\nlike with our Contacts.\n\n391\n00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:07.690\nWith a group or I think also with task,\nI know we've done it some other places,\n\n392\n00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:12.265\nbut what a group is, it's just a closed\ncircuit group that you are able to\n\n393\n00:18:12.265 --> 00:18:16.100\nadd members and be able to kind\nof have everything separate.\n\n394\n00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:20.637\nSo you can have like your main stuff and\nthen everything with your group you have\n\n395\n00:18:20.637 --> 00:18:25.470\nyour own group e-mail, your own group\ncalendar, and you're own group contact.\n\n396\n00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:26.710\nSo it's kind of just something that's,\n\n397\n00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:30.320\nyou just try to separate it out\nbecause if you think about people and\n\n398\n00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.560\nin any line of work, you're always having\nto work on different teams and groups.\n\n399\n00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.420\nAnd so trying to compartmentalize things\nmight it make it a little bit easier for\n\n400\n00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.930\nyou to, well, stay organized.\n\n401\n00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:44.380\nAll right, let's just go on down\nthe list just making sure, okay,\n\n402\n00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.716\nwhat about print options?\n\n403\n00:18:45.716 --> 00:18:47.487\nYes.\nAs e-mail you always had to print to\n\n404\n00:18:47.487 --> 00:18:48.196\ncalendar/?\n\n405\n00:18:48.196 --> 00:18:51.440\nI know, actually, Renee, here in our\ncompany, she always goes ahead and\n\n406\n00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.865\nprints out the day calendars and\nputs them on the conference rooms.\n\n407\n00:18:54.865 --> 00:18:58.030\nCuz we have a building that we\nshare with multiple companies.\n\n408\n00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:59.608\nSo it's just, hey, this is on it,\n\n409\n00:18:59.608 --> 00:19:03.050\ncuz everybody e-mails her to let them know\nwhen they're using the conference room.\n\n410\n00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:06.124\nSo she goes ahead and prints out\nthe day view, puts it on the side, and\n\n411\n00:19:06.124 --> 00:19:08.950\nthen everybody knows where everybody\nis supposed to be [LAUGH].\n\n412\n00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:10.011\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of helpful.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.\n\n413\n00:19:10.011 --> 00:19:10.553\n&gt;&gt; We like it.\n\n414\n00:19:10.553 --> 00:19:15.413\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so printing, and this is where\nwhat view do you want to look at?\n\n415\n00:19:15.413 --> 00:19:18.300\nIt doesn't really matter which\none you're on to start with,\n\n416\n00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.290\ncuz once you go to the print dialogue box,\nit will ask you.\n\n417\n00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:22.590\nHere, let me show you.\n\n418\n00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.978\nDown here at the top, well, I guess up\nhere at the top, not down here at the top.\n\n419\n00:19:24.978 --> 00:19:28.830\nSo we'll go here to print.\n\n420\n00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.980\nAnd then it comes out here to this.\n\n421\n00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.640\nNotice right there,\nthat if I did have multiple calendars, and\n\n422\n00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.600\nwe will talk about,\nwhy am I on Justin Timberlake's calendar?\n\n423\n00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.544\nSo, let's cancel on that.\n\n424\n00:19:41.544 --> 00:19:42.810\nOkay, well, how about I do that?\n\n425\n00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.230\nLet's go ahead and\nthat's where I could have just chosen it.\n\n426\n00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.850\nSorry, I got a little confused of like,\nI thought I'm Joey.\n\n427\n00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:53.010\nWait, I had opened Justin's calendar and\nI was showing you that.\n\n428\n00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.019\nSorry, guys.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n429\n00:19:54.019 --> 00:19:54.653\n&gt;&gt; Okay, back to the show.\n\n430\n00:19:54.653 --> 00:19:56.718\nLet's go ahead and\ncome over here to print.\n\n431\n00:19:56.718 --> 00:20:00.270\nBut I could just as easily\nchosen my calendar from there,\n\n432\n00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:04.490\njust has to do a little reset\nmy own brain there for a second.\n\n433\n00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:06.580\nAnd then we have what I'm I printing out?\n\n434\n00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.990\nWhich view do I want,\nthe day, week, work week?\n\n435\n00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:11.950\nAnd you can see that it will change.\n\n436\n00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:16.180\nAnd then there is some different\noptions in your layouts depending on\n\n437\n00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.500\nwhich one that you choose.\n\n438\n00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.450\nNotice the day view.\n\n439\n00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:23.310\nI don't have any other layout besides,\nwell, just the day view.\n\n440\n00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:26.030\nAnd then I can choose which line.\n\n441\n00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:28.110\nNow, you do need to know\nif you are on the day view.\n\n442\n00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.770\nMake sure you're on the day that\nyou actually want to print.\n\n443\n00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:31.480\nI have Friday,\n\n444\n00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.880\nSeptember 1st, when if I really\nwanted to print out today's calendar.\n\n445\n00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.010\nSo let's go ahead and\nback up there as well.\n\n446\n00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:42.650\nCome back over here to today, click on\nlet's go ahead and just click on today.\n\n447\n00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.590\nAnd I don't really need to click on it,\ncuz I was already there.\n\n448\n00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:47.412\nAnd now you can see that if I\nprint the day view, there we go,\n\n449\n00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:49.064\nyou can see it a little bit better.\n\n450\n00:20:49.064 --> 00:20:52.980\nAnd even more if I go to print, cuz then\nit takes me out to the print dialog box.\n\n451\n00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.490\nSo you can see, there we go.\n\n452\n00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.840\nSo that's basically what Rene will\nprint every day and put on the door.\n\n453\n00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.560\nOkay, so knowing how to print.\n\n454\n00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.390\nI'm going to go ahead and cancel that cuz\n\n455\n00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:06.445\nI'm sure people don't really want\nto see Joey's calendar for today.\n\n456\n00:21:06.445 --> 00:21:10.220\n[LAUGH] Going over like when I\njust clicked on something and\n\n457\n00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.670\nI feel we should go ahead and just review\nsome of that, just kind of getting into\n\n458\n00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:18.750\nhow you can see more options and\nthe different things within your calendar.\n\n459\n00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:23.480\nWhen I'm in the month view, or any view,\nif I wanted to see like what's going on\n\n460\n00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:28.390\nwith this meeting, if I single click, so\none click, notice that it just goes ahead\n\n461\n00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:32.230\nand gives me this little pop-up over\nhere that says this is a meeting.\n\n462\n00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:33.560\nI know this is a meeting.\n\n463\n00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.540\nI know that Joey is the organizer,\nthat's me.\n\n464\n00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:41.430\nAnd then I also know that there are two\npeople that have accepted this meeting.\n\n465\n00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:45.210\nWe're gonna talk about the difference\nbetween and appointment and a meeting.\n\n466\n00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:49.120\nReally, a meeting is just an appointment\nwith people that you've asked to come to.\n\n467\n00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.440\nYeah, [LAUGH] so\nthat's really the only difference.\n\n468\n00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.250\nAnd so you can see the difference, so\n\n469\n00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.498\nwhat you got going on here\nby single-clicking it.\n\n470\n00:21:55.498 --> 00:21:58.580\nI can single-click on this,\nI can single-click over here,\n\n471\n00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.690\nand then it gives me all of that.\n\n472\n00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:05.433\nNow, if I double-click on this,\nso double-double, double-double?\n\n473\n00:22:05.433 --> 00:22:07.848\n&gt;&gt; Boil and trouble.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, right.\n\n474\n00:22:07.848 --> 00:22:14.402\nSo now you actually see all the details\nof this particular Calendar event.\n\n475\n00:22:14.402 --> 00:22:17.350\nThat's what they're also calling them now.\n\n476\n00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.712\nSo, we always had fun with with\nwhat they want to go ahead and\n\n477\n00:22:19.712 --> 00:22:21.980\nuse the terminology for\ndescribing all of this.\n\n478\n00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.710\nSo, this is a calendar event, and\nI can see that I've got the ladies lunch.\n\n479\n00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:31.270\nI can see that it's got an actual address\nof Bentos, that's where we went today.\n\n480\n00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:32.300\nOr we tried.\n\n481\n00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.550\nAnd then, it was way too packed,\nwe went somewhere else.\n\n482\n00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.745\nSo you can see that it's actually,\nit's not loading up themap information.\n\n483\n00:22:39.745 --> 00:22:41.430\nOkay, well, that's interesting.\n\n484\n00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.630\nThat's okay, we'll just pretend it did.\n\n485\n00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:47.430\nAnd you can see all the details in here\nthat there's an actual attachment,\n\n486\n00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:48.840\nthere's a place for notes.\n\n487\n00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.340\nAnd I can see everything by\ndouble-clicking on that particular item.\n\n488\n00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.544\nI could always pop it up into\nanother window if I wanted to, but\n\n489\n00:22:56.544 --> 00:23:00.199\nin this case I'm just gonna go ahead and\nclose all the details of this.\n\n490\n00:23:00.199 --> 00:23:05.074\nBefore I close, do notice that there are\nsome other buttons that go across the top\n\n491\n00:23:05.074 --> 00:23:09.088\nnow, in your menu, that once you\nopen up and in the details you have\n\n492\n00:23:09.088 --> 00:23:14.210\nthings like the category, and adding\na Skype meeting and so on and so forth.\n\n493\n00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:15.170\nClosing this out,\n\n494\n00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:19.890\nnotice that the menu is different\nbecause you're not in an actual event.\n\n495\n00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.650\nSo double-clicking verses single-clicking.\n\n496\n00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:25.642\nThe other thing is you can also\ndouble-click from over here.\n\n497\n00:23:25.642 --> 00:23:29.009\nSo single-clicking or\ndouble-clicking over in the right pane,\n\n498\n00:23:29.009 --> 00:23:31.060\nthat's bringing up a kind of list view.\n\n499\n00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:35.550\nBut if you double-click in a blank space,\nlike here on August 15th,\n\n500\n00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:40.480\nif I double-click now, it's actually\na shortcut, if you wanna say,\n\n501\n00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.370\nto creating a new event.\n\n502\n00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:44.540\nSo now, it's like, okay,\nwell, what do you wanna do?\n\n503\n00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.020\nAnd it's all blank and\nthen you go ahead and fill it out.\n\n504\n00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.042\nSo just know, and the other thing is,\n\n505\n00:23:49.042 --> 00:23:53.534\nif you're double-clicking on the other\ncalendars that you don't have access to,\n\n506\n00:23:53.534 --> 00:23:57.010\nor blank areas like I wanna make\nan appointment for Joey, and\n\n507\n00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:01.550\nyou double-click on it, it actually\nis making an appointment for you.\n\n508\n00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:04.692\nSo, people are, see, I can add things\nto Joey's calendar, it's like nope,\n\n509\n00:24:04.692 --> 00:24:06.120\nyou're adding it to your own.\n\n510\n00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.550\nIt's just not even gonna let you do that,\n\n511\n00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:10.698\nunless you have those\nspecific permissions.\n\n512\n00:24:10.698 --> 00:24:13.950\nSo, double-clicking,\nsingle-clicking, and that's,\n\n513\n00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:16.950\nI'm just kinda looking at everything\nto make sure I covered it.\n\n514\n00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:20.370\nAnd I believe we have.\n\n515\n00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:21.470\nAnd if we didn't, guess what?\n\n516\n00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:22.038\nWe have more episodes.\n\n517\n00:24:22.038 --> 00:24:23.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We sure do.\n\n518\n00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.310\nAll right, Vonne, well, that was a nice\nlittle overlook on what we can expect when\n\n519\n00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:29.870\nwe look inside of the calendar\nsection of Outlook on the web.\n\n520\n00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.400\nNow, right before we close, I do remember.\n\n521\n00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.500\nDidn't you say something about\nshowing us settings, as well?\n\n522\n00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.100\nI don't think we got to that.\n\n523\n00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.940\n&gt;&gt; You know, I probably should\nhave put a reminder for myself.\n\n524\n00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.730\nI probably should have\nput it in my calendar.\n\n525\n00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:42.670\nYou're completely right.\n\n526\n00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.350\nI did tell you that I would\ntalk about the settings.\n\n527\n00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:49.060\nThat was when we were going over the work\nweek and if you had a different work week.\n\n528\n00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:49.660\nAll right, perfect.\n\n529\n00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.730\nSo you know what, why don't we\ndo that right now before we go.\n\n530\n00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:53.750\n&gt;&gt; That's probably a good idea.\n\n531\n00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:54.551\n&gt;&gt; Probably a good idea.\n\n532\n00:24:54.551 --> 00:24:56.174\n[LAUGH] So why don't we come in here.\n\n533\n00:24:56.174 --> 00:24:58.103\nI'm so\nglad I have you there to keep me in check.\n\n534\n00:24:58.103 --> 00:25:01.417\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes I actually earn my money.\n\n535\n00:25:01.417 --> 00:25:02.242\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n536\n00:25:02.242 --> 00:25:04.819\njust like we have our different\nsettings in our mail, and\n\n537\n00:25:04.819 --> 00:25:07.350\nthere really wasn't anything\ngoing on with contacts.\n\n538\n00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:11.190\nLet's come over here to these settings,\nand then down to the very bottom,\n\n539\n00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:15.510\nwe can go to the, no we're not going\nto people, we're going to calendar.\n\n540\n00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:19.600\nIt's back there on the bottom, just like\nwhere you have your mail and everything.\n\n541\n00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.610\nIt's behind my head.\n\n542\n00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:21.146\nIt's there.\n\n543\n00:25:21.146 --> 00:25:22.542\nThere it is.\n\n544\n00:25:22.542 --> 00:25:25.690\n[LAUGH] So there we go, we have calendar.\n\n545\n00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:29.140\nAnd then when I go to calendar,\nyou all have been her a couple times so\n\n546\n00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.360\nyou're like I know where it is, it's okay.\n\n547\n00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.600\nSo I have the calendar,\n\n548\n00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.010\nand this is where we have some different\nsections over here on the left.\n\n549\n00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:39.610\nNotice we have personalization and\nthe calendar appearance.\n\n550\n00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:43.410\nAnd this is what I was talking\nabout with the work weeks.\n\n551\n00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:46.620\nNotice right here it\nsays show workweek as.\n\n552\n00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.750\nAnd we have Monday, Tuesday,\nWednesday, Thursday, and Friday.\n\n553\n00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.830\nWhat I got to do is start changing\nthe check boxes so I can say, well,\n\n554\n00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:57.350\nit goes from Tuesday through Sunday.\n\n555\n00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.181\nAnd Monday or wait,\nI guess that's Wednesday.\n\n556\n00:26:00.181 --> 00:26:01.672\n[LAUGH] Through Sunday.\n\n557\n00:26:01.672 --> 00:26:04.822\nJust whichever ones you want on or\noff, that's what you can do.\n\n558\n00:26:04.822 --> 00:26:08.920\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nturn that back on to just Monday.\n\n559\n00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.320\nMaybe your working hours\naren't eight to five.\n\n560\n00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.310\nMaybe they're ten to seven or whatever.\n\n561\n00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:18.390\nSo you could go ahead and\nset what is your work period.\n\n562\n00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:20.350\nAnd then you can see some other options.\n\n563\n00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:25.360\nShow the week number, start the first week\nof the year on the first day of the year,\n\n564\n00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.830\nthat kinda makes a little\nbit more sense to me.\n\n565\n00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:31.560\nBut you can see that you can have like the\nfirst full work week especially if like\n\n566\n00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.380\nall of us just your vacation, so\nit doesn't even matter to you,\n\n567\n00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.580\nso why don't we go ahead and start there?\n\n568\n00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.570\nAnd then what is the first\nday of the week?\n\n569\n00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:40.990\nTalk about those colors!\n\n570\n00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.171\nThere are nine, or only nine colors.\n\n571\n00:26:43.171 --> 00:26:45.811\n[LAUGH] We have light and\nwe also have bright.\n\n572\n00:26:45.811 --> 00:26:49.310\nSo you can see the difference here,\nbut it's only one or the other.\n\n573\n00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.060\nIt's not like we can add into it.\n\n574\n00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.090\nBut you see there's got\nmy brain going there.\n\n575\n00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:55.390\nWhat if we need more than that?\n\n576\n00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:57.150\nBut I guess we don't\nhave any other options.\n\n577\n00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:59.840\n&gt;&gt; And then-\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n578\n00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.620\n&gt;&gt; It changed, it changed colors.\n\n579\n00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.945\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah,\nwell that's because I clicked the buttons.\n\n580\n00:27:04.945 --> 00:27:05.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you just get to\n\n581\n00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.150\nchoose one set or the other?\n\n582\n00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:08.063\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n&gt;&gt; I was like, wow,\n\n583\n00:27:08.063 --> 00:27:08.870\nthere's a whole new set.\n\n584\n00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:10.537\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm like, did I miss something?\n\n585\n00:27:10.537 --> 00:27:14.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which happens, so, yeah.\n\n586\n00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.608\nOkay, yeah, it's just an either or\nthere, Daniel.\n\n587\n00:27:16.608 --> 00:27:21.630\n[LAUGH] And then when we get into\nscheduling our appointments.\n\n588\n00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:23.440\nLike they always go in\n30 minute increments.\n\n589\n00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:27.127\nYou could always still put that in 15\nminutes increments if you wanted to.\n\n590\n00:27:27.127 --> 00:27:28.090\nRemember that weather?\n\n591\n00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.660\nI made some changes, so I'm gonna\ngo ahead and just discard them so\n\n592\n00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.745\nit just keeps the options.\n\n593\n00:27:32.745 --> 00:27:33.980\nNotice weather.\n\n594\n00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:37.880\nWe can show the weather and whether or\nnot we want it in Fahrenheit or Celsius.\n\n595\n00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.410\nAnd then I added Gainesville\nas our location, but\n\n596\n00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:43.620\nof course you can add other ones in here.\n\n597\n00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.560\nWe get into some things\nwhen we talk about events.\n\n598\n00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:52.340\nRemember, an appointment or\na meeting is really an event.\n\n599\n00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:56.100\nAnd so, you could see that actually,\nyes, sorry,\n\n600\n00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.495\n[LAUGH] Getting myself a little turn\naround in this episode right here.\n\n601\n00:27:59.495 --> 00:28:03.775\nThat will be the Invitations, like\nwhen you're being invited to an event.\n\n602\n00:28:03.775 --> 00:28:05.195\nThere we go.\n\n603\n00:28:05.195 --> 00:28:09.595\nHow it's gonna treat the mail that comes\nthrough when it's associated with it.\n\n604\n00:28:09.595 --> 00:28:12.945\nWe'll talk all about this in the meetings,\nbut I just wanted to go ahead and\n\n605\n00:28:12.945 --> 00:28:14.615\npoint that out to you right now.\n\n606\n00:28:14.615 --> 00:28:16.755\nThis one right here,\nthe events from e-mail, and\n\n607\n00:28:16.755 --> 00:28:18.690\nI don't know if you have this, Daniel.\n\n608\n00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:24.190\nI do use Google calendar for myself,\nand when I like schedule flight and\n\n609\n00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:28.330\nI say that my e-mail addresses is my Gmail\nlike if I go from Delta or American.\n\n610\n00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:28.927\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n611\n00:28:28.927 --> 00:28:30.490\nit puts my flight information right there.\n\n612\n00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:31.730\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Have you ever had that happen?\n\n613\n00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:32.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's pretty cool stuff.\n\n614\n00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:33.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n615\n00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:35.495\nWell, this is pretty much\nthe exact same thing.\n\n616\n00:28:35.495 --> 00:28:36.146\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n617\n00:28:36.146 --> 00:28:37.496\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if you're using and\n\n618\n00:28:37.496 --> 00:28:40.643\nyou're saying, I wanted to e-mail Joey at-\n&gt;&gt; Hold on, you're telling me that\n\n619\n00:28:40.643 --> 00:28:43.420\nMicrosoft saw other people doing something\nreally cool that people liked and\n\n620\n00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.450\nthen they made something\nidentical to that?\n\n621\n00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:46.400\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's amazing.\n\n622\n00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.002\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't sound like them at all.\n\n623\n00:28:48.002 --> 00:28:50.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, exactly.\n\n624\n00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:53.590\nSo it's just very much what\nI'm used to seeing in Google.\n\n625\n00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.320\nIt's all in here.\n\n626\n00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.840\nAnd then our reminders.\n\n627\n00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.290\nThat was a thing that if I\nactually had my sound on,\n\n628\n00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:05.570\nthere would have been a little bling when\nit told me to remind me to say hello.\n\n629\n00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:09.510\nYou could also get text messages, but\nI don't have my text messages set up.\n\n630\n00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:11.440\nBut you would have to do that.\n\n631\n00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:16.510\nIf you click here, it actually jumps you\ninto setting up text messages which is\n\n632\n00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:19.910\nin another place of your set up and\nyour options.\n\n633\n00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:21.700\nSo we're not gonna necessarily\ndo that right now.\n\n634\n00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.500\nThere, it's in the general for\ntext messaging.\n\n635\n00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.180\nBut if you wanted that option, you could.\n\n636\n00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.380\nAnd then just a few other ones.\n\n637\n00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.410\nHow you're going to publish your calendar,\nwe'll talk about that when we share it.\n\n638\n00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:33.810\nAnd then there's the birthdays.\n\n639\n00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:35.480\nThat's the one I wanted to show you.\n\n640\n00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.780\nSo you can see that I turned\non the birthday calendar.\n\n641\n00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.300\nThat was that option\nthat I was telling you.\n\n642\n00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:46.680\nAnd what was good to trigger\nyou to remind me to tell you,\n\n643\n00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.580\nwhat these settings are for\nyour calendars.\n\n644\n00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.250\nAnd now, I believe, I'm done.\n\n645\n00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:53.890\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\nI feel we're more complete now, right?\n\n646\n00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:54.893\nSo everyone,\n\n647\n00:29:54.893 --> 00:30:00.337\nwe're feeling the control of the room\ncoming together a little more nicely?\n\n648\n00:30:00.337 --> 00:30:01.111\nI think we are.\n\n649\n00:30:01.111 --> 00:30:03.017\n&gt;&gt; Harness the good, rock the bad.\n\n650\n00:30:03.017 --> 00:30:05.834\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Feeling good out there, right?\n\n651\n00:30:05.834 --> 00:30:07.940\n[LAUGH] It's circular,\nit goes around, and up and down.\n\n652\n00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.110\nIt's like a carousel.\n\n653\n00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:11.422\nAnyway, we're gonna leave\nbefore we digress too far.\n\n654\n00:30:11.422 --> 00:30:12.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, thanks so much for\n\n655\n00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.430\nstopping by today and\n\n656\n00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:17.910\nshowing us how to use the calendar\nfeatures inside of Outlook on the web.\n\n657\n00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:19.220\nBut it does look like\nwe are out of time for\n\n658\n00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:23.210\nthis episode, so\nwe're forced to sign off for OfficePro.TV.\n\n659\n00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:24.180\nWe do thank you for watching.\n\n660\n00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.370\nI've been you host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n661\n00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:25.950\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n662\n00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.344\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n663\n00:30:27.344 --> 00:30:33.665\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:17.324\nI'm your host Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:21.072\nAnd today we are continuing\nour Outlook on the Web series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.072 --> 00:00:25.499\nIn particular we're gonna be looking at\ncreating and managing appointments using\n\n6\n00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.770\nOutlook which is lucky for me because I\nhave a whole lot of trouble managing.\n\n7\n00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.362\nAnd well, sometimes just creating my\nappointments even just in my brain.\n\n8\n00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:36.873\nLuckily we have the one, the only, the Ms.\nVaughn Smith here to help us along.\n\n9\n00:00:36.873 --> 00:00:38.012\nHow are you doing today Vaughn?\n\n10\n00:00:38.012 --> 00:00:39.066\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n11\n00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.667\nI wanna welcome you back, you've been\nmissing out of our episodes for a while,\n\n12\n00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:44.958\nbut, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like I've been hiding or\n\n13\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:45.493\nsomething.\n\n14\n00:00:45.493 --> 00:00:46.667\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But not really.\n\n15\n00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:49.790\nI've been busy doing some DevPro stuff but\nI'm back, and\n\n16\n00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.900\nI'm here to learn more about Outlook.\n\n17\n00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.113\nSo what are we actually going to do today?\n\n18\n00:00:54.113 --> 00:00:57.854\nI know we have a general title, but\nI don't know what that means, really.\n\n19\n00:00:57.854 --> 00:00:59.915\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well luckily for me,\nI will be able to help you.\n\n20\n00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:04.163\nCuz just like we had on our account,\nor that we use internally for\n\n21\n00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:09.604\nwho's going to be hosting, which event or\nwhat episode you were on the schedule.\n\n22\n00:01:09.604 --> 00:01:11.425\nWe had an appointment today for\n\n23\n00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:15.285\nyou to be be in the studio with me\ntalking about Outlook on the web.\n\n24\n00:01:15.285 --> 00:01:18.972\nAnd so that's what we're gonna be\ntalking about here in our calendar,\n\n25\n00:01:18.972 --> 00:01:21.069\nas we're going to make an appointment.\n\n26\n00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:24.377\nSo we're gonna go ahead and jump on in,\nget through all the details.\n\n27\n00:01:24.377 --> 00:01:27.160\nBecause we had introduced the interface,\n\n28\n00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.957\nkinda got used to what we were looking for\nin the calendar.\n\n29\n00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:33.050\nWe opened some events and\nthings like that but\n\n30\n00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.150\nnow we're actually going\nto be creating it.\n\n31\n00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.672\nAnd using that terminology there's\ncalling everything here an event, okay.\n\n32\n00:01:39.672 --> 00:01:43.416\nNow an event can be either\nan appointment or a meeting.\n\n33\n00:01:43.416 --> 00:01:47.618\nNow really the differences between an\nappointment and a meeting there, Justin?\n\n34\n00:01:47.618 --> 00:01:48.349\n&gt;&gt; A word?\n\n35\n00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:51.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm guessing just the label that used\n\n36\n00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:52.903\ninternally.\n\n37\n00:01:52.903 --> 00:01:54.330\nYou said they're both events.\n\n38\n00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.245\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So my programmer mind's like,\n\n39\n00:01:56.245 --> 00:01:57.926\nall right so we have an event class.\n\n40\n00:01:57.926 --> 00:02:02.195\nAnd then below that we have inheriting\nfrom the event and appointment or meeting.\n\n41\n00:02:02.195 --> 00:02:02.807\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n42\n00:02:02.807 --> 00:02:04.230\n&gt;&gt; And how are they different.\n\n43\n00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.811\nThey're called something different,\nI guess.\n\n44\n00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:06.864\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it doesn't get that complicated.\n\n45\n00:02:06.864 --> 00:02:07.799\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n46\n00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.748\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What a difference is at meeting\nyou have people that you have invited to\n\n47\n00:02:11.748 --> 00:02:14.970\nan appointment, so\nthat's the biggest difference, okay.\n\n48\n00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.599\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So you're inviting attendees.\n\n49\n00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.382\nAttendees, when you're doing a meeting.\n\n50\n00:02:18.382 --> 00:02:20.140\nAn appointment is really just for you,\n\n51\n00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.866\nyou're talking about keeping\nit up in your noodle, right.\n\n52\n00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:28.382\nSo that would be your own noodle,\ncalendar, appointment, keeper.\n\n53\n00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:31.400\nSo you'd have to tell\nyourself what I'm doing.\n\n54\n00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.172\nAnd so that's the biggest difference.\n\n55\n00:02:33.172 --> 00:02:36.882\nSo sorry, that kind of like talking about\nthe terminology and where we're at.\n\n56\n00:02:36.882 --> 00:02:39.613\nSo why don't we come back down into\nhere and let me show you where we're at.\n\n57\n00:02:39.613 --> 00:02:41.983\nI have my calendar for Joey.\n\n58\n00:02:41.983 --> 00:02:45.353\nI still have my kitty cats,\nI couldn't take that away just yet.\n\n59\n00:02:45.353 --> 00:02:50.493\nAnd then today you can see that I do have\nan appointment that is scheduled for\n\n60\n00:02:50.493 --> 00:02:51.970\nMonday at 5:30.\n\n61\n00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.300\nI have a hockey meet and\ngreet at the Amalie Arena,\n\n62\n00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.517\nbecause we're getting so\nmuch closer to hockey season for me.\n\n63\n00:02:59.517 --> 00:03:02.332\n[LAUGH] So it's not real,\nI just made it up.\n\n64\n00:03:02.332 --> 00:03:05.374\nBut you can see that I have\nsome details over here,\n\n65\n00:03:05.374 --> 00:03:08.712\nin this section that let's\nme know that this is for me.\n\n66\n00:03:08.712 --> 00:03:10.131\nAnd that I've created this.\n\n67\n00:03:10.131 --> 00:03:13.000\nSo I'm gonna show you how\nyou can create your own.\n\n68\n00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.912\nHow about we do Thursday?\n\n69\n00:03:15.912 --> 00:03:18.072\nI'd like to go ahead and\nmake an appointment for\n\n70\n00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:19.641\nmyself to keep myself organized.\n\n71\n00:03:19.641 --> 00:03:23.760\nAnd I'm going to have, well,\nlunch with you Justin.\n\n72\n00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.802\nWe're gonna go out to lunch on Thursday,\nhow's that?\n\n73\n00:03:25.802 --> 00:03:29.405\n&gt;&gt; That sounds spectacular, but the only\nproblem is, is after we set a date and\n\n74\n00:03:29.405 --> 00:03:32.125\ntime, it's we've got to\nfigure what we're gonna eat.\n\n75\n00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:34.018\nAnd I don't know if Alex\ngonna help us with that.\n\n76\n00:03:34.018 --> 00:03:35.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll leave that alone for now.\n\n77\n00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.101\nWe'll just set a date and\ntime but that sounds fantastic.\n\n78\n00:03:38.101 --> 00:03:42.083\n&gt;&gt; As we're going you can make some\nsuggestions and its nice because when we\n\n79\n00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:46.013\nput in the appointment details,\nits going to give us a map for all that.\n\n80\n00:03:46.013 --> 00:03:47.471\nHow about we go ahead and do that now.\n\n81\n00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:48.997\nHow do I make an appointment for\n\n82\n00:03:48.997 --> 00:03:52.831\nmyself knowing that I'm gonna be going\nout to lunch with Justin on Thursday.\n\n83\n00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:56.810\nYou can either right click on the date\nthat you're going to be creating\n\n84\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.710\nappointment, go to New.\n\n85\n00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.302\nYou could also double click on that day,\nor\n\n86\n00:04:01.302 --> 00:04:05.560\nyou can come up to the drop down up\nhere where it has new calendar event.\n\n87\n00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.419\nThat whole kind of using that\nterminology as an event there.\n\n88\n00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:12.627\nNow the difference is if you double click\non the day it will usually default to\n\n89\n00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:14.220\ndoing all day appointment.\n\n90\n00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.309\nWell, you know what,\nas soon as I say that,\n\n91\n00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:20.097\nthat's the local version of Outlook\nthat'll let you do that because right here\n\n92\n00:04:20.097 --> 00:04:22.492\nit's actually not doing\nan all day appointment.\n\n93\n00:04:22.492 --> 00:04:25.454\nBut that's okay, we know that we can have\na whole bunch of different ways to go\n\n94\n00:04:25.454 --> 00:04:26.791\nahead and create an appointment.\n\n95\n00:04:26.791 --> 00:04:30.011\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\njust start going through the options.\n\n96\n00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:31.380\nSo what are we gonna title this?\n\n97\n00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.941\nI'm gonna say lunch with,\nI almost said Daniel.\n\n98\n00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:38.410\n[LAUGH] You can tell I've been\nhosting with him a lot now.\n\n99\n00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.411\n&gt;&gt; Well don't worry because I'm\npretty sure I've had several people.\n\n100\n00:04:42.411 --> 00:04:45.630\nI'm watching you and Daniel do a show and\nsomeone goes, is that you and Vonne?\n\n101\n00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.471\nAnd I'm like no, that's Daniel,\ncuz they hear our voices.\n\n102\n00:04:48.471 --> 00:04:50.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And we have similar vocal ranges so,\n\n103\n00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.552\n&gt;&gt; You definitely do.\n\n104\n00:04:51.552 --> 00:04:53.088\n&gt;&gt; I don't take any offense to that.\n\n105\n00:04:53.088 --> 00:04:54.614\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n106\n00:04:54.614 --> 00:04:57.122\nAll right, so now we're going\nto go ahead and add a location.\n\n107\n00:04:57.122 --> 00:05:01.195\nNow this is where if you have a global\naddresses what we're talked about and\n\n108\n00:05:01.195 --> 00:05:05.721\nthere's also resources within those global\naddresses that up on the admin level,\n\n109\n00:05:05.721 --> 00:05:07.160\nthey go ahead and create.\n\n110\n00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.856\nYou might have things\nlike conference rooms or\n\n111\n00:05:09.856 --> 00:05:14.650\nmeeting rooms that have been added at\nthat level that you can choose from.\n\n112\n00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.661\nNow some other ones that you're seeing in\nmine, you can see I have Bob's office.\n\n113\n00:05:18.661 --> 00:05:23.639\nI also have Amalie Arena that's because\nits remembering my most recently\n\n114\n00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.332\nused items or locations for\ndifferent appointments or\n\n115\n00:05:27.332 --> 00:05:31.444\nmeetings that I've been creating,\njust letting you know.\n\n116\n00:05:31.444 --> 00:05:35.821\nAnd if you had resources within your\nglobal address list like conference room\n\n117\n00:05:35.821 --> 00:05:37.852\nA, B, C, and D, or what have you.\n\n118\n00:05:37.852 --> 00:05:41.848\nIf you just start typing in the first\ncouple words of that, it will pull\n\n119\n00:05:41.848 --> 00:05:46.403\nfrom your global address list, and it\nwill go ahead and give you those options.\n\n120\n00:05:46.403 --> 00:05:50.342\nSo we're talking about some\ndifferent places around us.\n\n121\n00:05:50.342 --> 00:05:55.035\nAnd just because I've been thinking\nabout making tacos lately, so\n\n122\n00:05:55.035 --> 00:05:57.021\nhow about we type in Moe's?\n\n123\n00:05:57.021 --> 00:06:00.350\nAnd now you can see that Moe's is\nright around the corner for us,\n\n124\n00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.891\nit's kinda pull up, okay, that's the one.\n\n125\n00:06:02.891 --> 00:06:05.751\nR Cherough which is actually not\nthe one closest to us but hey,\n\n126\n00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:07.131\nwe can go over to that one too.\n\n127\n00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:10.932\nSo you can see that it's kinda a little\nbit connected to your Bing map.\n\n128\n00:06:10.932 --> 00:06:13.821\nIt might ask you the first time\nyou've ever done this to allow for\n\n129\n00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:16.580\nyour location that's just\nlike a browser setting.\n\n130\n00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:22.042\nBut geolocation you know a lot\nabout that stuff Justin [LAUGH].\n\n131\n00:06:22.042 --> 00:06:23.061\nI will get this.\n\n132\n00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:27.262\n&gt;&gt; You will get my name right, and\nyes typically you're going to allow for\n\n133\n00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:31.827\na domain and it's gonna ask you to allow\neach time to allow forever or to deny.\n\n134\n00:06:31.827 --> 00:06:36.145\nAnd now if you deny essentially all your\ngeolocation services is gonna be x down.\n\n135\n00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:39.892\nIf you did wanna change those things\nthose are browser specific setting,\n\n136\n00:06:39.892 --> 00:06:43.893\ntypically does your change using the\nlittle padlock next to your address bar.\n\n137\n00:06:43.893 --> 00:06:45.843\nBut that's outside the scope for this.\n\n138\n00:06:45.843 --> 00:06:50.216\nSo just keep in mind, if you're not seeing\nthings populated with a geo located\n\n139\n00:06:50.216 --> 00:06:54.802\nlike places then that means you mean might\nhave geolocation services turned off.\n\n140\n00:06:54.802 --> 00:06:56.527\n&gt;&gt; That's a really good\npoint because you're like,\n\n141\n00:06:56.527 --> 00:06:58.222\nmine's not coming up with\nanything around here.\n\n142\n00:06:58.222 --> 00:07:00.162\nSo that's a really good\nthing to know about.\n\n143\n00:07:00.162 --> 00:07:02.509\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nthrow in most but\n\n144\n00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:05.944\nnow again if you didn't want to\nhave an address like right here.\n\n145\n00:07:05.944 --> 00:07:10.612\nMaybe I don't even have it connected,\nmaybe it needs to be in Tim's office for\n\n146\n00:07:10.612 --> 00:07:11.471\nsome reason.\n\n147\n00:07:11.471 --> 00:07:13.640\nBecause Tim's want to talk\nabout the weather with us or\n\n148\n00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.922\nsomething like of that effect.\n\n149\n00:07:14.922 --> 00:07:19.973\nSo, I'll just go ahead and say Tim's\noffice, and yeah, did I spell that right?\n\n150\n00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:20.802\nOkay yeah, close enough.\n\n151\n00:07:20.802 --> 00:07:24.080\nSo you can see that it is trying\nto pull something from there but\n\n152\n00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.932\nit doesn't have to be map related,\nso that's okay.\n\n153\n00:07:26.932 --> 00:07:29.670\nAll right, so\nwhat date is it starting on now?\n\n154\n00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.473\nThat's because I double clicked on that\nday but if you needed to start like maybe\n\n155\n00:07:33.473 --> 00:07:37.105\nI realized it was supposed to be next\nThursday not this Thursday then I need to\n\n156\n00:07:37.105 --> 00:07:39.243\ngo ahead and\npick the date that it starts on.\n\n157\n00:07:39.243 --> 00:07:43.866\nNow this is a single time appointment\nthat I'm doing right now to where, okay,\n\n158\n00:07:43.866 --> 00:07:47.253\nit's only gonna be for an hour and\na half or for lunch time.\n\n159\n00:07:47.253 --> 00:07:49.751\nSo I could have it start and\nend on the same day but\n\n160\n00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:51.702\nwhat if we are going to a conference.\n\n161\n00:07:51.702 --> 00:07:55.650\nMaybe we're going to a conference\nin Orlando or something like that.\n\n162\n00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.783\nSo then I can have it span\nmultiple days and multiple times.\n\n163\n00:07:59.783 --> 00:08:04.927\nIt starts at 8AM and ends at 5PM on\nthat Sunday or something to that effect.\n\n164\n00:08:04.927 --> 00:08:05.920\nSo you have that.\n\n165\n00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.706\nSome other options over here,\nthat if this was an all day appointment.\n\n166\n00:08:08.706 --> 00:08:11.400\nHey, maybe we're gonna go\nto lunch all day, right?\n\n167\n00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.950\nWe go ahead and check that off.\n\n168\n00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.980\nNotice that then my times, my start and\nend date times aren't going to be\n\n169\n00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.620\navailable to me, because it's just like,\nthis is the whole day.\n\n170\n00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.300\nSo that's something you might wanna go\nahead and consider if you need it done.\n\n171\n00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.290\nIf you have it set to private,\n\n172\n00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.510\nthat's how it's showing up on\nthe calendar to other people.\n\n173\n00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.090\nWhen it's private, it kind of\nmeans exactly what it sounds like.\n\n174\n00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.450\nNot everybody can see those details.\n\n175\n00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.130\nAnd when you get into like Calendar\nsharings and sharing options,\n\n176\n00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:44.520\nyou can have whether or not that person\nyou're sharing your calendar with has\n\n177\n00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.300\naccess to the details of\nyour private appointments.\n\n178\n00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.060\nBecause we all use our work calendars but\nthere might be something that you're gonna\n\n179\n00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.340\nbe out of the office and you don't wanna\ntell people why you're doing that.\n\n180\n00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.039\nSo you can go ahead and\nmark that as private if needed.\n\n181\n00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.780\nAnd then if you need to go ahead and set\nit to a different time zone if I'm telling\n\n182\n00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:06.980\nthis to be like a specific time,\nit will then like change it for\n\n183\n00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.950\nyou automatically cuz you're in Eastern\ntime zone in the sense that well we are.\n\n184\n00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.370\nAnd we had it set that that's what it is.\n\n185\n00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.161\nBut my appointment I know is\ngonna be 5PM pacific time,\n\n186\n00:09:18.161 --> 00:09:22.274\nwell then I would change it to\nwhatever it is in my timezone and\n\n187\n00:09:22.274 --> 00:09:25.838\nthen put it at I guess it\nwould be 8PM on my schedule.\n\n188\n00:09:25.838 --> 00:09:29.620\nSo that's just like when you're entering\nthe time of the appointment and\n\n189\n00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.024\nthen how it changes there.\n\n190\n00:09:31.024 --> 00:09:36.397\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nchange this from, we'll go 11:30 to 1:30,\n\n191\n00:09:36.397 --> 00:09:39.823\nmake sure we have all traffic and\neverything like that.\n\n192\n00:09:39.823 --> 00:09:40.460\nAll right, and\n\n193\n00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.580\nthis is where we have [INAUDIBLE]\nis this a recurring appointment?\n\n194\n00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.670\nSo this one,\nwe are not gonna have it repeat for\n\n195\n00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:48.130\nright now, just a one time thing.\n\n196\n00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:52.197\nBut notice if I did have it something\nlike, hey I need to have a manager's\n\n197\n00:09:52.197 --> 00:09:56.666\nmeeting every Friday for the next however\nmany times, you can go ahead and go and\n\n198\n00:09:56.666 --> 00:09:59.060\nset that recurrence, that pattern.\n\n199\n00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.650\nWe'll look at that in a little bit.\n\n200\n00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:02.930\nNow, you can have multiple calendars.\n\n201\n00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.450\nNow, this one, this reunion tour,\nby the way, this is a group calendar, so\n\n202\n00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.050\nthat's something a little bit different.\n\n203\n00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.120\nWe have a whole episode on groups that\nkind of explain that a little bit more,\n\n204\n00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.860\nbut you can have more than\none type of calendar.\n\n205\n00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.583\nSo that's where you can set which\ncalender is supposed to be to.\n\n206\n00:10:19.583 --> 00:10:20.975\nAnd then the reminder,\n\n207\n00:10:20.975 --> 00:10:24.975\nI love me some reminders cuz I need to\nalways remind myself is where I'm at.\n\n208\n00:10:24.975 --> 00:10:32.249\nSo what iteration or what time do\nyou want the reminder to be set.\n\n209\n00:10:32.249 --> 00:10:35.976\nAnd then how it's gonna be shown\nin your calendar again when you\n\n210\n00:10:35.976 --> 00:10:40.687\nget into where other people can access\nyour calendar or even see your calendar,\n\n211\n00:10:40.687 --> 00:10:42.680\nhow do you want people to know?\n\n212\n00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.510\nAre you going to be away from the office?\n\n213\n00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.890\nIn this case, we are going to, well,\nwait, I said we're going to Tim's office.\n\n214\n00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.275\nSo I guess we're still here.\n\n215\n00:10:49.275 --> 00:10:50.790\n[LAUGH] If we were at Moe's we'd be away.\n\n216\n00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.980\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI think Tim's office is code for Moe's.\n\n217\n00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.890\nI'm gonna go with code for,\nwe'll just go away, I think.\n\n218\n00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:58.910\n&gt;&gt; I think we'll go away.\n\n219\n00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.610\nBut the nice thing is working elsewhere.\n\n220\n00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.550\nAnd that's something\nthat kind of expanded.\n\n221\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.490\nI think it was always like, busy, away.\n\n222\n00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.530\nThere wasn't as many options.\n\n223\n00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.820\nSo this is like, hey, I'm still working.\n\n224\n00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.040\nI'm just not in the office.\n\n225\n00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.570\nI like that they've added\nsome of that stuff.\n\n226\n00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.290\nYou could also add an email\nreminder which is nice.\n\n227\n00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.430\nOkay, so it's gonna email me hey,\nthis is what's going on and\n\n228\n00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.410\nI can actually put a message as\nto what I wanted to tell me.\n\n229\n00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:28.745\nLike lunch, there we go and\nit's going to remind me one day and\n\n230\n00:11:28.745 --> 00:11:31.112\nsend a reminder just to me.\n\n231\n00:11:31.112 --> 00:11:34.930\nAnd if we had at attendees in the meeting,\nthen you could go ahead and set that.\n\n232\n00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:36.040\nAll right, let's keep on going down.\n\n233\n00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.860\nThis is where we could add notes.\n\n234\n00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.770\nNotice, we could just say notes go here.\n\n235\n00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.850\nAnd we can put all sorts\nof different stuff.\n\n236\n00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:46.538\nSo it's nice for\nyou to know what's going on down here.\n\n237\n00:11:46.538 --> 00:11:47.910\nAnd then there we go.\n\n238\n00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:52.420\nSo I've gone through pretty much every\noption you could have in an appointment,\n\n239\n00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.820\nall we got to do now is\nreally go ahead and save.\n\n240\n00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.480\nThere's some other things that we'll go\nover, some of those are different places.\n\n241\n00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.040\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonna,\n\n242\n00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.470\nI do have a quick question before you\nget off that screen if I can catch you.\n\n243\n00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:06.350\nThe put as or describe as, we're on a way,\n\n244\n00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:11.270\nI'm working elsewhere or busy, are there\nany ways that we can expand that or\n\n245\n00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.970\nare we kind of bound to this default list?\n\n246\n00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.130\nCuz I know you were saying they have\nadded to it but can we add to it?\n\n247\n00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's a great question and\nI really don't know the answer.\n\n248\n00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:22.600\nI'm going to say,\n\n249\n00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.750\nthere's always the answer sure\nwith some proper coding [LAUGH].\n\n250\n00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.760\nBut I mean for the options that\nit's giving to us by default,\n\n251\n00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.880\nI believe that these are the only ones\nthat they give us that I know of.\n\n252\n00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.140\nIt's just throughout the years of\nOutlook kinda progressing that\n\n253\n00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.070\nthey've added the working elsewhere.\n\n254\n00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.790\nThat's something that hasn't\nalways been part of Outlook.\n\n255\n00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.690\nNow customizing it, I'd have to\ndefault to the Oracle, and even\n\n256\n00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:50.530\nmaybe to the people at Microsoft to let\nme know whether or not that is possible.\n\n257\n00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:54.365\nBut if it is,\nit's gotta be probably at an admin level,\n\n258\n00:12:54.365 --> 00:12:57.295\nlike a super admin level that\nyou might be able to do that.\n\n259\n00:12:57.295 --> 00:12:59.884\nSo, that's my answer,\n[LAUGH] I don't really know.\n\n260\n00:12:59.884 --> 00:13:02.630\n[LAUGH] But, great question.\n\n261\n00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.795\nAll right, so\nnow we've got a couple more things.\n\n262\n00:13:04.795 --> 00:13:05.475\nWell, I think that's it.\n\n263\n00:13:05.475 --> 00:13:10.045\nWe're gonna go ahead and save and\nnotice you can attach a file, okay.\n\n264\n00:13:10.045 --> 00:13:12.835\nWe'll talk about Skype meeting\nwhen we talk about meetings.\n\n265\n00:13:12.835 --> 00:13:16.745\nSome of these other things that I've added\nbefore or seen before in other places.\n\n266\n00:13:16.745 --> 00:13:19.380\nYou could add a charm and\nyou can add a category,\n\n267\n00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.690\nbecause all of these can\nbe used in categories.\n\n268\n00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.040\nYou could go ahead, and\ndo right up here on this menu bar.\n\n269\n00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.920\nOr I'll show you after I save\nthis that there are somethings\n\n270\n00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:33.980\nthat you can do after the fact, but\nright now it's right there on the 24th.\n\n271\n00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.740\nAnd it's pink but\nI really wanna like make that stand out.\n\n272\n00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.850\nAnd I wanna give it a green category and\na different charm.\n\n273\n00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:47.180\nYou can right-click on that particular\ncalendar event, and then go ahead and\n\n274\n00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:47.860\ndo some of that.\n\n275\n00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.690\nYou can see even change the show as\nright there and I can categorize it.\n\n276\n00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.090\nSo let's go ahead and make this green.\n\n277\n00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:57.010\nAnd then let's go ahead and\ngive it a charm.\n\n278\n00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.790\nLet's try that again and\nwe'll give it a charm.\n\n279\n00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:01.290\nI think, there are, yes, there's some\nlittle fork and knife right there, so\n\n280\n00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:05.020\nthat way I know that we're\nhaving some lunch options.\n\n281\n00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.610\nSo you can see there's some\ndifferent things that you\n\n282\n00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.000\ncan do by right clicking on it.\n\n283\n00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.560\nWhich one of them is you go ahead and\ndelete it, maybe you've cancelled for\n\n284\n00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.110\nwhatever reason, you've decided,\nno we're not gonna lunch and\n\n285\n00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.650\nthen I could go ahead and\ndelete this from my calendar.\n\n286\n00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:20.744\nSo there we go.\n\n287\n00:14:20.744 --> 00:14:23.060\nNow of course editing your appointments,\n\n288\n00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.710\nyou could just double\nclick it right from there.\n\n289\n00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.300\nIt brings up from the details.\n\n290\n00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.550\nYou can go ahead and change anything.\n\n291\n00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:32.894\nbut there is one thing that\nI would like to go ahead and\n\n292\n00:14:32.894 --> 00:14:35.782\npoint out here that I\nthink it's kind of fun,\n\n293\n00:14:35.782 --> 00:14:40.279\nis that you could change the date\nright from this list and dragging it.\n\n294\n00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:42.771\nOkay, so,\nI'm in this month view cuz I like it.\n\n295\n00:14:42.771 --> 00:14:48.270\nFor example, this appliance shopping that\nwas supposed to be for me, last Saturday.\n\n296\n00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:49.770\nWell, guess what?\n\n297\n00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.969\nI decided to not be an adult that day,\nand I went to the beach instead.\n\n298\n00:14:52.969 --> 00:14:56.740\nSo [LAUGH] I realize that I really\ndidn't make that appointment.\n\n299\n00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:01.030\nAnd so I really should probably go ahead\nand do it this weekend, so this Saturday.\n\n300\n00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:05.480\nAll I have to do is take just this and\njust drag it down to the next day or\n\n301\n00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.710\nthe other day that I want it to be on.\n\n302\n00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.430\nAnd boom, it just goes ahead and stays.\n\n303\n00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.300\nIt's an all-day event, so\n\n304\n00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.950\nyou can see that I'm supposed to\ngo everywhere appliance shopping.\n\n305\n00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:17.670\nI do have it checked on as all-day and\nthen it only for that time.\n\n306\n00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.020\nSo I do like the drag and\n\n307\n00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:23.470\ndrop method if you're moving\nit from one day to the other.\n\n308\n00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:28.520\nNow if it's within the same time in\nthe day, if you go into the day view,\n\n309\n00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.700\nyou can go ahead and\ndrag and drop it from there.\n\n310\n00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:35.180\nYou just have to change which view that\nyou're looking at whether you want it\n\n311\n00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:41.168\nhourly or by day and that's how you\ncan go ahead and drag them around.\n\n312\n00:15:41.168 --> 00:15:44.333\nAll right, let's talk about,\njust a reoccurring appointment, just so\n\n313\n00:15:44.333 --> 00:15:45.723\nyou can see some of the options.\n\n314\n00:15:45.723 --> 00:15:50.987\nLet's say that I need to make an event\nthat's gonna start on September 8th For\n\n315\n00:15:50.987 --> 00:15:56.172\nevery Friday and from 12 to 1,\nwe're gonna have hockey countdown until,\n\n316\n00:15:56.172 --> 00:16:01.640\nlet's say October 6th, the opening day\nof the Tampa Bay Lightning season.\n\n317\n00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.140\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and move over,\nnavigate over to the September 8th, and\n\n318\n00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.890\nI'm going to double click, just cuz\nthat's the way that I normally like\n\n319\n00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:11.210\nto go ahead and\nstart to create my appointments.\n\n320\n00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:14.650\nAnd so we'll just say Hockey update.\n\n321\n00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.880\nAnd, ooh, let's pretend I can go ahead and\nspell this.\n\n322\n00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.940\nAnd we'll just go ahead and say,\nI'm just gonna say online cuz maybe it's\n\n323\n00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.460\nlike a forum that I'm part of or\nwhat have.\n\n324\n00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:31.591\nIt's gonna start on the 8th and it's going\nto be from, we'll say, 11:00 to 12:00.\n\n325\n00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.164\nWe'll go ahead and do that.\n\n326\n00:16:34.164 --> 00:16:36.380\nAll right, now when is it going to repeat?\n\n327\n00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.530\nThis is that whole recurrence\nthat's going to happen.\n\n328\n00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.460\nI want it to happen every Friday.\n\n329\n00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:45.135\nNotice it does have some options\nright here like every day, every day,\n\n330\n00:16:45.135 --> 00:16:47.000\neighth of every month.\n\n331\n00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.730\nSo it kind of knows the different\ntypes of iterations that maybe people\n\n332\n00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.180\nare used to doing.\n\n333\n00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:57.170\nNow let's just say instead of every\nFriday, it's every other Friday.\n\n334\n00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.190\nBut I don't have that in my list.\n\n335\n00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:04.350\nIf you go to other, then it's going\nto bring up this repeat pattern that\n\n336\n00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:09.480\nyou can go ahead and set, that it is\na Weekly or same time of the month.\n\n337\n00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:14.260\nAnd if I did Weekly and then said two,\nthat would be every other,\n\n338\n00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.870\nevery two weeks on that Friday,\nthat I could set.\n\n339\n00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:21.147\nMaybe it's every two weeks Friday,\nand Wednesday, so\n\n340\n00:17:21.147 --> 00:17:26.430\nyou have this different types of how you\ncan edit this occurrence that's happening.\n\n341\n00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.414\nI'm gonna go ahead and cancel that and\n\n342\n00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:32.330\njust go back to every Friday because I\ndid something that I would like to do.\n\n343\n00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:37.350\nAnd then you can set the date or\nthe range that this is going to happen.\n\n344\n00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.337\nIt's gonna start on the eighth and\neven though I don't know,\n\n345\n00:17:40.337 --> 00:17:43.750\nwell I do know exactly when\nOctober sixth is, it's a Friday.\n\n346\n00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:47.050\nNow, if I needed to, that's the wrong\nyear, let's go back in here.\n\n347\n00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:52.080\nSo let's go into October,\neven if I put the 3rd.\n\n348\n00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:56.350\nWell, it doesn't matter,\nit doesn't have to be any on a Friday.\n\n349\n00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:59.500\nIt'll just be that the last one\nwould be the Friday before that.\n\n350\n00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:05.390\nSo you don't have to specify a specific\nFriday that you're going to end it on.\n\n351\n00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:10.270\nBut for this one, we are going to\npick the 6th, and I have my reminder.\n\n352\n00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:15.160\nAnd that's wonderful, so I go ahead and\nsave that appointment that I had, and\n\n353\n00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.220\nthen it goes ahead and\npopulates on my calendar.\n\n354\n00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:22.190\nAll right,\nnow editing reoccurring appointments.\n\n355\n00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.760\nBecause when you have\na reoccurring appointment,\n\n356\n00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.750\nyou have the whole thing, right?\n\n357\n00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.830\nWhat is called a series.\n\n358\n00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:32.590\nOr you could go ahead and\nedit individual occurrences.\n\n359\n00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:38.320\nSo let's just say that, for\nwhatever reason, the group that I'm with,\n\n360\n00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.200\nthey're not going to meet\nat the September 22nd.\n\n361\n00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.620\nThey're not going to do it that Friday.\n\n362\n00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.950\nOnly that week and that week only,\nthey're going to do it Thursday.\n\n363\n00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:50.350\nAnd I'm sure this has\nhappened from time to time.\n\n364\n00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.440\nHey, we need to move this\nmeeting to this particular date,\n\n365\n00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.320\neven though we meet every Monday.\n\n366\n00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.000\nThis particular one,\nit is a holiday, so on and so forth,\n\n367\n00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.350\nwe go on ahead and do that.\n\n368\n00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.140\nNow watch what happens,\nif I scroll out a little, and\n\n369\n00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:06.220\nI double click on the 22nd one,\nit's going to go ahead and open this up.\n\n370\n00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:11.290\nNow it says, you're editing a single\noccurrence of a repeating series.\n\n371\n00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.860\nOr do you want to edit the series.\n\n372\n00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.620\nSo that's something that you do\nneed to make sure you realize,\n\n373\n00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.380\nlike where are you within this.\n\n374\n00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.780\nAnd I believe, if I'm not mistaken,\nyou can right click on this, and\n\n375\n00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:27.850\nyou can see that, if you are deleting,\nor you're opening,\n\n376\n00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:33.150\nthat's the other option, right click, and\nI can go directly into Open the series,\n\n377\n00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:37.180\nor opening the occurrence, or\nin this case, deleting it, all right?\n\n378\n00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.440\nSo just making sure you know\nwhich one you're doing.\n\n379\n00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.800\nSo opening the occurrence,\nmaking sure I'm there,\n\n380\n00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:48.360\nthis one's going to start on that\nThursday and it ends the same time.\n\n381\n00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:54.590\nI go ahead and click Save and you can see\nthat just that one had been moved over.\n\n382\n00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:58.870\nSo just be aware of\nthe reoccurring appointments,\n\n383\n00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:04.250\nwhich one you want to be in, so\nthe series or that particular one.\n\n384\n00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.390\nSo that's really important.\n\n385\n00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:10.250\nNow let's say that I need\nto forward an appointment,\n\n386\n00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.090\nnow why would I need to do that?\n\n387\n00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.290\nLet's say, hey I have this\nmarketing meeting right here, so\n\n388\n00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:19.510\nyou can see that let's opening it, and\nI can see that it's in Bob's office, and\n\n389\n00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:20.070\nit's from 9:30 to 10:30.\n\n390\n00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:23.480\nBring your meeting notes, and\n\n391\n00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.500\nthat's what's going to happen, so\nmaybe I need to send this to you.\n\n392\n00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:31.110\nYou need to be included into this.\n\n393\n00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.630\nSo I just wanna kind of, well just\nlike I would forward an email, right?\n\n394\n00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:37.090\nLike, hey,\nI think this might be of interest to you.\n\n395\n00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:38.080\nI can go ahead and do that.\n\n396\n00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:42.350\nNow once I have it opened,\nthat's not what I wanna do.\n\n397\n00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.458\nLet's go ahead and save this.\n\n398\n00:20:43.458 --> 00:20:45.760\n[LAUGH] I thought there was a button.\n\n399\n00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.340\nSometimes was, I think it's in a meeting\nrequest that you can go ahead and\n\n400\n00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.420\ndo the reply.\n\n401\n00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.020\nBut that’s, okay.\n\n402\n00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.490\nLet me show you the other\nway you can forward it.\n\n403\n00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:56.510\nYou might have seen it already as you\ncan go ahead and right click on it.\n\n404\n00:20:56.510 --> 00:21:02.670\nIf I right click, I could forward this\nseries and then I could send it to.\n\n405\n00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:03.750\nHey, Justin,\n\n406\n00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:07.780\nyou're going to be Justin Timberlake\ntoday all right [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n407\n00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:13.120\nSo you can go ahead and say that I'm\nsending this off to Justin, and I send it,\n\n408\n00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.860\nand then that person is going\nto get that forwarded mail.\n\n409\n00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.810\nI actually have Justin's computer,\nwell, let me go ahead and\n\n410\n00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:21.750\nstart that virtual machine back up.\n\n411\n00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:26.900\nBut you'll be able to see,\nonce I get this open, that his mail,\n\n412\n00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.670\nwell, now I gotta sign in.\n\n413\n00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.970\nAll right, well,\nI thought I had that computer started up.\n\n414\n00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:37.570\nThere we go, if I go over to his mail,\nyou'll be able to see\n\n415\n00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:43.550\nthat in his inbox,\nhe should have that and there it is.\n\n416\n00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:48.610\nThere's Joey's marketing meeting and\nthen it's right there that Justin\n\n417\n00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:53.210\ncould go ahead and open this in\na separate window or he can go ahead and\n\n418\n00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:57.170\njust include that into his calendar.\n\n419\n00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:01.640\nAnd I believe if I double-click it, there\nyou go, you can go ahead and take that.\n\n420\n00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.490\nAnd it does not want to, give me that.\n\n421\n00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.530\nWell, anyways, let's go ahead and\npretend [LAUGH] that that's\n\n422\n00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:10.250\nwhat it's going to do and\nthen you can add it to your calendar.\n\n423\n00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:12.020\nAnd then you can move on from there.\n\n424\n00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.987\nSo that's kind of a nice way of\nforwarding, whoops, too many swipes.\n\n425\n00:22:14.987 --> 00:22:18.310\n[LAUGH] Just jumping all\nover the place there.\n\n426\n00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:21.490\nAnd so you can go ahead and\nforward on your message.\n\n427\n00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:26.266\nSo now I would want to talk to you about,\n[LAUGH] this is something that's,\n\n428\n00:22:26.266 --> 00:22:31.211\n[SOUND] it's one of those things I can't\nseem to find an answer to, Justine.\n\n429\n00:22:31.211 --> 00:22:34.430\nI'm sure you've have this\nhappening to you a lot, right?\n\n430\n00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:37.238\nIf I'm trying to find an answer,\none of those will be like,\n\n431\n00:22:37.238 --> 00:22:39.350\nI want to copy an appointment.\n\n432\n00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:42.529\nI wanna copy this and then just go\nahead and put it somewhere else.\n\n433\n00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:47.640\nI can't find how to do that,\nI will just tell you that right now.\n\n434\n00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.990\nI go to try and right click,\nI try to Google it.\n\n435\n00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:53.060\nSo at the time of this recording,\n\n436\n00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:57.830\nI cannot find a way that I want to\ncopy this and put it somewhere else.\n\n437\n00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:01.900\nSo in case anybody else is thinking\nabout that, if you're like me, like,\n\n438\n00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.950\nwouldn't it be easier if it's the same\nthing, I just kinda wanna move it over?\n\n439\n00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:07.390\nI guess you could just go ahead and\n\n440\n00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:10.140\nmake an occurrence,\nlike make it, you know what?\n\n441\n00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.580\nI was thinking about this.\n\n442\n00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.980\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes just talking\nit through is helpful.\n\n443\n00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:19.370\nNow, I wanna make sure that\nwe're all on the same page here.\n\n444\n00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:22.480\nThere's not an easily accessible\nright click, just copy over.\n\n445\n00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.260\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n446\n00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.830\n&gt;&gt; If you're thinking to yourself,\nwhoa, couldn't I just reenter it, and\n\n447\n00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.100\ntechnically that's a copy?\n\n448\n00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.970\nYeah, tomato, tomato, but\nthere's not something through the UI\n\n449\n00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:36.010\nthat allows me to go right-click,\ncopy to this calendar, or copy to\n\n450\n00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:40.270\nwherever you need to copy it to, that's\nwhat we're ultimately talking about.\n\n451\n00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.054\n&gt;&gt; And I just thought of this.\n\n452\n00:23:42.054 --> 00:23:46.170\nWhat if you did this,\nwhat if you edit the appointment,\n\n453\n00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:51.774\nmake it a reoccurring for a daily, or\na weekly, just once, one iteration,\n\n454\n00:23:51.774 --> 00:23:57.661\nthen take that iteration and then edit\nthat And had it moved to a different date.\n\n455\n00:23:57.661 --> 00:24:00.600\nThat's how you can kinda copy it,\ncouldn't you?\n\n456\n00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI guess you could possibly copy that like,\n\n457\n00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:05.610\neven copying within the calendar.\n\n458\n00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n459\n00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.082\n&gt;&gt; That might work.\n\n460\n00:24:08.082 --> 00:24:09.807\nThat might, you never know.\n\n461\n00:24:09.807 --> 00:24:12.349\nSometimes you just gotta, please work.\n\n462\n00:24:12.349 --> 00:24:13.261\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n463\n00:24:13.261 --> 00:24:14.525\n&gt;&gt; But that is a good idea.\n\n464\n00:24:14.525 --> 00:24:15.975\nThat's definitely worth a try.\n\n465\n00:24:15.975 --> 00:24:20.265\n&gt;&gt; I honestly thought of it as we're\ntalking about it in this whole episode.\n\n466\n00:24:20.265 --> 00:24:23.208\nSo hey, that's something that\nI'm thinking I might try.\n\n467\n00:24:23.208 --> 00:24:25.220\nSo anyways, that's where we're going to.\n\n468\n00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.475\nThe other thing, everything that we've\nbeen talking about is the same in our\n\n469\n00:24:28.475 --> 00:24:31.610\noutlook.com, our free\nversion of our outlook.\n\n470\n00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:34.791\nAnd then the other one I wanted\nto go with is birthdays, right?\n\n471\n00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:37.470\nWe talked about I in\nthe birthday calendar.\n\n472\n00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:42.089\nIt is a setting within your\ncalendar settings, your options.\n\n473\n00:24:42.089 --> 00:24:46.130\nSo if you wanted to add a birthday,\njust come back down into here,\n\n474\n00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.440\nyou can see that I can go up and\ndo a new birthday event.\n\n475\n00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.860\nSo it is in the drop down\nitem right here if you want.\n\n476\n00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:57.661\nThe other thing you can do, is if you\nright click on the calendar on the list,\n\n477\n00:24:57.661 --> 00:24:59.402\nyou can add a new birthday.\n\n478\n00:24:59.402 --> 00:25:02.896\nAnd then you can put in the first and\nthe last name and then the birthday and\n\n479\n00:25:02.896 --> 00:25:06.616\nthen if you want a reminder cuz it's\nalways good to be reminded of somebody's\n\n480\n00:25:06.616 --> 00:25:07.500\nbirthday.\n\n481\n00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.236\nCuz then when they show up like yes,\nit's my birthday.\n\n482\n00:25:09.236 --> 00:25:12.100\nAnd I'm like, I knew that.\n\n483\n00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.511\nNo I didn't, I totally forgot.\n\n484\n00:25:13.511 --> 00:25:17.480\n[LAUGH] So it's always good to go\nahead and put that as a reminder.\n\n485\n00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.203\nI'm gonna go ahead and discard that.\n\n486\n00:25:19.203 --> 00:25:20.850\nAnd I'm gonna close out the birthdays.\n\n487\n00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.640\nAnd so that is pretty much\nall the things I can show you\n\n488\n00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.110\nabout creating an appointment.\n\n489\n00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:30.480\nIt really comes down to you organizing\nyour life and your calendar and\n\n490\n00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.390\nmaking sure that all those color\ncodings and all those categories\n\n491\n00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:38.330\nmean something to you, because those\ncategories do go across all of Outlook.\n\n492\n00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:41.641\nSo if you start using green in\nyour calendar for one thing and\n\n493\n00:25:41.641 --> 00:25:46.491\nthen green in your email as another thing,\nthat's where it can be a little confusing.\n\n494\n00:25:46.491 --> 00:25:49.120\nSo try to kinda keep\nthat across the board.\n\n495\n00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.650\nI mean, and I have people that, like I\nthink I have said it in other episodes.\n\n496\n00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:56.420\nThey use their calendar like to the hills,\nright?\n\n497\n00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:00.580\nThey put everything in there to make sure\nthat they don't skip anything because like\n\n498\n00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:04.730\nyou said sometimes, sometimes our noodle\ndoesn't always noodle the right way.\n\n499\n00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:10.180\nSo write it down and then hopefully,\nyou can stay on track.\n\n500\n00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:13.100\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne, I'm definitely going to try\nto implement a few of these in my life\n\n501\n00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:17.930\nbecause if nothing else, sometimes they're\nlike, hey, you forgot about coming to\n\n502\n00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:21.940\nyour doctor's appointment or\ncoming to someone's birthday.\n\n503\n00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:25.610\nI was busy and really I just forgot.\n\n504\n00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:27.240\nSo I definitely I need to work on these.\n\n505\n00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:31.550\nI'm pretty sure the color coding may\nend up being a huge time sync to me cuz\n\n506\n00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:36.580\nI would always try to keep\nthose as very particular to me.\n\n507\n00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:41.300\nNow we figured out how to manage our own\nlife, but we still got more where we need\n\n508\n00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.130\nto figure out how to manage our lives\nalong with other people's as well.\n\n509\n00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.350\nSo definitely join us back for\nmore Outlook on the Web.\n\n510\n00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:49.070\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nfinish this one up.\n\n511\n00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.310\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n512\n00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.164\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n513\n00:26:53.164 --> 00:26:55.125\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n514\n00:26:55.125 -->

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.760\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\nin today's episode, well, we're continuing\n\n4\n00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.340\nour trek on Outlook in the web, on the\nweb, I'll get that right in just a moment.\n\n5\n00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.060\nIn particular, we're looking at organizing\na bunch of people together using meetings.\n\n6\n00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.433\nAnd luckily, we have the expert in\nthat very topic, Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:34.543\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n\n8\n00:00:34.543 --> 00:00:36.079\n&gt;&gt; I'm so good, I love your introductions.\n\n9\n00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:36.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n10\n00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.712\n&gt;&gt; We're in the web or on the web, for\n\n11\n00:00:38.712 --> 00:00:39.610\nthe web.\n\n12\n00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, who knows?\n\n13\n00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.639\nYou're a professional cat herder.\n\n14\n00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:43.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure those are the same\n\n15\n00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.670\nas organizing people, so\nwe're good to go, right?\n\n16\n00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.990\n&gt;&gt; I did have to schedule a meeting\nof the cats this weekend,\n\n17\n00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.780\nbecause they had to get their flea\ncontrol, and they didn't like that.\n\n18\n00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.620\nBut they didn't know they were invited.\n\n19\n00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.670\nIt was just like, get on the counter!\n\n20\n00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.590\nAnd they're like-\n&gt;&gt; It would be\n\n21\n00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.941\nreally weird if your cat had calendars.\n\n22\n00:00:57.941 --> 00:00:59.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you were like,\n\n23\n00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.330\nyour calendar's booked?\n\n24\n00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.450\nNo, I'm gonna need you to go ahead and\ncome in now.\n\n25\n00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.450\n&gt;&gt; I think they're on their own schedule,\nbecause if the food is not in front of\n\n26\n00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.400\nthem at a certain time,\nthings just start coming off the counter.\n\n27\n00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, be like whoops.\n\n28\n00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.535\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I know you like that, but it's broke.\n\n29\n00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:13.599\nWhere's my food at, right?\n\n30\n00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:14.161\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n31\n00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:15.062\nI've got your attention?\n\n32\n00:01:15.062 --> 00:01:15.833\nCome on, feed me.\n\n33\n00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:17.211\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Meow.\n\n34\n00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:18.120\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n35\n00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.890\nSo yes, we are gonna be talking\nabout some meeting here.\n\n36\n00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.591\nAnd we did find out in the other episode,\nif you had watched\n\n37\n00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:27.180\nthe Creating Appointments, that\nthe difference between an appointment and\n\n38\n00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.012\na meeting is that meeting has the people\ninvited to that particular appointment.\n\n39\n00:01:31.012 --> 00:01:35.044\nSo that's gonna be the biggest difference,\nso if you've watched that episode then\n\n40\n00:01:35.044 --> 00:01:37.851\na lot of things in here are pretty\nmuch going to be a repeat.\n\n41\n00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:42.459\nBut we're gonna do the whole having\nthe invites go out to people, and\n\n42\n00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:45.340\nthe attendees and all of their responses.\n\n43\n00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.780\nLuckily, of course, as you know,\nI have control of three different people.\n\n44\n00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.685\nI am Justin, and\n[LAUGH] now with you being here.\n\n45\n00:01:52.685 --> 00:01:54.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Now it just got awkward.\n\n46\n00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.040\nReally, hold on,\nI was not given the appropriate memo.\n\n47\n00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.025\nYou should have sent out an invite to\nlet me know that I'm under your power.\n\n48\n00:02:01.025 --> 00:02:02.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n49\n00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.030\nSo JT and Joey and Lance.\n\n50\n00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.326\nAnd so we're going to have,\n\n51\n00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:11.340\nwhat you have is the meeting organizer\nif you are the one creating the meeting.\n\n52\n00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.090\nAnd then we'll also see if you are the one\nbeing invited to a meeting and\n\n53\n00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.390\nhow that all works.\n\n54\n00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.430\nIt is nice having control of\nlots of different people and\n\n55\n00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.840\nall of their accounts.\n\n56\n00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.526\nYeah.\nThey're all me anyway so, so\n\n57\n00:02:23.526 --> 00:02:25.941\n[LAUGH] why don't we\ncome on down into here.\n\n58\n00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:26.467\nAnd you know what?\n\n59\n00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:31.374\nI did wanna go ahead and before we start\ninto the meeting, I wanted to throw\n\n60\n00:02:31.374 --> 00:02:36.070\nout something that kind of perplexed\nme honestly in our last episode.\n\n61\n00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.040\nWhen we were creating appointments,\nthere was something about forwarding.\n\n62\n00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.130\nAnd why don't I go ahead and show you here\nthat in the Outlook on the web version\n\n63\n00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.310\nright here, remember I tried to open\nthis and I kind of fumbled a little bit.\n\n64\n00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.440\nI was like, hey, this didn't work but\nit really should work.\n\n65\n00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.240\nWell, I tested it out again and\n\n66\n00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.860\nit's just not wanting to work\nin this particular browser.\n\n67\n00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.480\nI'll be completely honest,\nI did not check this in Edge.\n\n68\n00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.780\nBut so far, in all these things\nthat have been happening,\n\n69\n00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.470\nthe browser versions hasn't been\na big factor into this, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.892\nBut the whole forwarding an appointment.\n\n71\n00:03:08.892 --> 00:03:11.550\nAll right, so Joey went ahead and\n\n72\n00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.070\nforwarded his, I actually forwarded\nthe Appliance Shopping right over here.\n\n73\n00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.900\nAnd you can see, and\nthis was the other one.\n\n74\n00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.900\nYou can come into here and\nyou can preview it, and\n\n75\n00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.000\nI can see that this is the Marketing\nmeeting, and it says bring your notes.\n\n76\n00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.320\nAnd I can download it, but you can already\nsee, I tried this a couple of times.\n\n77\n00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.060\nIt just downloads as this weird file and\n\n78\n00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.920\nit's not being able to\njust add to my calendar.\n\n79\n00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.041\nAnd you and\nI were talking about this off camera,\n\n80\n00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:39.784\neven while you're not using Outlook\nyou get this sent to you and\n\n81\n00:03:39.784 --> 00:03:42.610\nyou can just add it right to your\naccount and everything is fine.\n\n82\n00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's weird.\n\n83\n00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.760\nMost of the time,\nI've never had an issue with,\n\n84\n00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.720\nit doesn't matter whether it comes from\nan Outlook calendar, from an iCalender or\n\n85\n00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.370\nfrom a Gmail calendar or\nwhatever it may be.\n\n86\n00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.080\nWhen it comes to me, I usually the ability\nto add to calendar from within the email\n\n87\n00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.750\nand it adds it to my calendar.\n\n88\n00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.930\nEven if I'm not necessarily\nan invited person,\n\n89\n00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.050\nit's just someone sending me hey\nhere's what's up about this event.\n\n90\n00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.666\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd you had talked about an ISC, or\n\n91\n00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:09.980\nICS file,\nit's an International that's not it.\n\n92\n00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.749\nIt's something about like it's a universal\ncalendar format, and we will talk about\n\n93\n00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:17.360\nthese different types of file formats\nwhen we get into shared calendars.\n\n94\n00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.260\nBut yeah,\nI just found it very interesting.\n\n95\n00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.930\nBut I wanted to show you that in the local\ninstallation of Outlook what happens, and\n\n96\n00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.690\nthat's what I was kinda going on.\n\n97\n00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.880\nIt's just gonna work the same.\n\n98\n00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.682\nAnd well guess what?\n\n99\n00:04:27.682 --> 00:04:30.280\n[LAUGH] Don't ever assume,\ncuz you know what happens.\n\n100\n00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.540\nSo you can see that if I open this in\nthe local version, it opens up and\n\n101\n00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.830\nI can copy it to my calendar.\n\n102\n00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.000\nSo it's like somebody's\nforwarded this to me,\n\n103\n00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.830\nin a sense that they want me to add it\nto mine, it's right here in the local.\n\n104\n00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.650\nI just don't see it as fluid,\n\n105\n00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.110\nif you want to say, or streamlined\nin the Outlook on the web version.\n\n106\n00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.938\nI'm not saying it's not possible, but\nfor me and today, the time of recording,\n\n107\n00:04:54.938 --> 00:04:57.060\n[LAUGH] it's not wanting\nto play very nicely.\n\n108\n00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.680\nSo, I just wanted to throw that out\nthere for you guys to let you know.\n\n109\n00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:02.730\nStranger things have happened.\n\n110\n00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.125\nMaybe it works just fine for\nyou, and maybe its just me.\n\n111\n00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:07.212\nThat happens a lot.\n\n112\n00:05:07.212 --> 00:05:10.330\n[LAUGH] But just wanted to\nthrow that out there to you.\n\n113\n00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.830\nOkay, so let's go back over to Joey.\n\n114\n00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.280\nAnd Joey is going to create a meeting.\n\n115\n00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.490\nWe're going to have a working lunch.\n\n116\n00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.740\nAnd he is going to invite JT and\nLance to this lunch.\n\n117\n00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.830\nSo that's where we're going to\nbe as the meeting organizers.\n\n118\n00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.490\nSo let's go ahead and\ncreate a new calendar event.\n\n119\n00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.080\nOkay.\n\n120\n00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.390\nAnd I'm going to schedule it for\nthis Friday.\n\n121\n00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.070\nSo we're gonna say Working Lunch,\nlet's go ahead and put a space in there.\n\n122\n00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.175\nAnd we'll go ahead and put My Office.\n\n123\n00:05:46.175 --> 00:05:47.635\nWow, look at all those.\n\n124\n00:05:47.635 --> 00:05:49.760\n[LAUGH] So we have My Office and\n\n125\n00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.390\nwe're going to do this for\nthis Friday, which is the 25th.\n\n126\n00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.760\nAnd we will go for,\nlet's do 11:00 to 1:00.\n\n127\n00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.050\nSo we'll have a nice long lunch,\nand there we go.\n\n128\n00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.470\nAll the other stuff, I can go ahead and\ndo the reminders and\n\n129\n00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.740\nI can say bring your notes.\n\n130\n00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.730\nAll these different things\nthat I could go through.\n\n131\n00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.770\nI can add an email reminder as well for\n\n132\n00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.450\nthe day before and\nsend it to all the attendees.\n\n133\n00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.570\nSo, again,\nI'm kind of going over it really quickly,\n\n134\n00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.140\nbecause we did cover\nthis in the appointment.\n\n135\n00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.370\nIf you haven't watched that episode,\n\n136\n00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.210\ndefinitely go ahead and go back to that\nparticular one and check this out.\n\n137\n00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.160\nNow, the other thing is I could come\nup here and add a Skype meeting.\n\n138\n00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.200\nNow, the only thing that's going to do\nis just go ahead and add a link for\n\n139\n00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.410\nyou to be able to have\nan online Skype meeting.\n\n140\n00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.410\nSo it's nothing super fancy besides,\nwatch,\n\n141\n00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.660\nif I go ahead and\nget some online meeting information.\n\n142\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.890\nAnd I do have Skype for\nBusiness already set up, and\n\n143\n00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.950\neverything on my account that way.\n\n144\n00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.853\nAnd it's just going to add a link into\nthe email that's going to go out to\n\n145\n00:06:55.853 --> 00:06:57.582\nall of your recipients.\n\n146\n00:06:57.582 --> 00:07:00.712\nSo it goes ahead and gives you an ID and\nall of that kind of fun stuff.\n\n147\n00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:05.203\nSo that's something that a lot of\ntimes we're nowadays doing a lot of\n\n148\n00:07:05.203 --> 00:07:09.780\nmeetings online, and so Skype is one\nof those options that you can do.\n\n149\n00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.120\nOf course since it's a Microsoft\nproduct they're gonna want you do that.\n\n150\n00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.485\nThey probably don't want you\ndoing Google Hangouts from here.\n\n151\n00:07:15.485 --> 00:07:17.530\n[LAUGH] So\nwe're going to set all of those.\n\n152\n00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:23.030\nNow over here we're gonna start\nadding people into this meeting.\n\n153\n00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.350\nNow notice Joey's already there because,\nwell, he's the meeting organizer.\n\n154\n00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.970\nSo we've got that.\n\n155\n00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.490\nSo let's go ahead and\nadd in Justin to here.\n\n156\n00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.100\nAnd we will also add in Lance.\n\n157\n00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.760\nThere we go.\n\n158\n00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.139\nSo yep, that's the right one.\n\n159\n00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.340\nSo now you can see that I have\ninvited these particular attendees.\n\n160\n00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.000\nAnd everybody is,\nI'm requesting a response from them.\n\n161\n00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.740\nNow if you turn that off, they're just\nbeing invited and they don't get a chance\n\n162\n00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.272\nto [LAUGH] refuse or decline, just like\nyou're coming to the meaning there.\n\n163\n00:07:54.272 --> 00:07:57.133\nAnd then if I have a lot of\npeople you could go ahead and\n\n164\n00:07:57.133 --> 00:08:01.101\nsee that once we get back into\n&gt;&gt; When I am getting responses from\n\n165\n00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:06.071\nsomebody as the organizer how I want\nto sort them by their status and\n\n166\n00:08:06.071 --> 00:08:08.770\nso on, and so forth there.\n\n167\n00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.635\nAnd I could go ahead and\nstop right there, but\n\n168\n00:08:11.635 --> 00:08:14.285\nthese two people are in my organization.\n\n169\n00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:18.990\nSo we all kind of work together in their\noffice pro demo, you all know that.\n\n170\n00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.145\nSo, we're all on the same domain.\n\n171\n00:08:20.145 --> 00:08:24.291\nThere's something known as the scheduling\nassistant that can be really,\n\n172\n00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:25.490\nreally handy to you.\n\n173\n00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.207\nBecause if you can start looking at other\npeople's calendars before you even set\n\n174\n00:08:29.207 --> 00:08:32.597\nthe meetings, it's one of those like hey,\nI'm setting this meeting and\n\n175\n00:08:32.597 --> 00:08:36.060\nthen someone is like I already have\nsomething scheduled at that time.\n\n176\n00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.716\nYou could have avoided that,\n\n177\n00:08:37.716 --> 00:08:41.720\nif you have people within your\norganization to become the schedulers.\n\n178\n00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.676\nThis is really, really handy, especially\nif you're dealing with a lot of people.\n\n179\n00:08:45.676 --> 00:08:47.350\nBecause I don't know if Justin,\nyou've done this.\n\n180\n00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.078\nYou start adding a bunch of people and\n\n181\n00:08:49.078 --> 00:08:52.890\nthree people are like I'm gonna be\nout that day or that's gonna be.\n\n182\n00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.490\nIt starts to gets a little obnoxious.\n\n183\n00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:58.621\n&gt;&gt; I have found after three people trying\nto get more than three people together at\n\n184\n00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:03.680\nany single time and you were like you can\njust take that off, and don't ask them.\n\n185\n00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.430\nPart of me is like yeah,\nI'm just gonna tell them to be there.\n\n186\n00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.032\nBecause if you ask they're\nlike I've got lunch or\n\n187\n00:09:09.032 --> 00:09:15.310\nI've got I got to go pick up something,\nor I have some other appointment.\n\n188\n00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.390\nI do wanna ask you a question.\n\n189\n00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:20.916\nThis assumes, looking at this calendar\nthat they actually use the calendar\n\n190\n00:09:20.916 --> 00:09:22.480\nservice appropriately.\n\n191\n00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.290\nBecause this guy is really bad about that.\n\n192\n00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.750\n&gt;&gt; That is such a good point.\n\n193\n00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.009\nIt's funny.\nWhile you're sitting there,\n\n194\n00:09:29.009 --> 00:09:32.229\nI'm thinking yeah, as long as everybody\nis using their calendar the right way.\n\n195\n00:09:32.229 --> 00:09:35.860\nSo, it's almost like picked up\non that what I was thinking.\n\n196\n00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.421\nYeah, if somebody's not gonna\nlive by their calendar,\n\n197\n00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:42.130\nthen it would be a little difficult.\n\n198\n00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.330\nAnd that's where like you're saying,\n\n199\n00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.900\neverybody uses this to whatever\ndegree helps them in their life.\n\n200\n00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:53.440\nSo, this is only as much as they go ahead\nand insert into their own calendar.\n\n201\n00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.184\nSo if I am looking for\na working lunch a between 11 or 1,\n\n202\n00:09:57.184 --> 00:10:01.320\nI can already see right here that\nit's already got a conflict.\n\n203\n00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.225\nThat somebody and\nI believe this is Justin.\n\n204\n00:10:04.225 --> 00:10:09.269\nJustin already has something\nfrom 11:30 to 1:30 and\n\n205\n00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:12.985\nI can see somebody else's got something.\n\n206\n00:10:12.985 --> 00:10:13.565\nThat's me.\n\n207\n00:10:13.565 --> 00:10:15.544\nThat's me, I was Joey.\n\n208\n00:10:15.544 --> 00:10:19.810\nSo, you could see that you got some\ndifferent options going on here.\n\n209\n00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.195\nWait, actually, you know what?\n\n210\n00:10:21.195 --> 00:10:23.910\nThis is during the week.\n\n211\n00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.076\nHere we go.\nWell, actually, I think on the 25th,\n\n212\n00:10:27.076 --> 00:10:28.480\neverybody's free.\n\n213\n00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.493\nSo I should probably go ahead and pay\nattention to the day I'm looking at, but\n\n214\n00:10:32.493 --> 00:10:33.810\njust to give you an idea.\n\n215\n00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:37.668\nIt's like it is going show you other\npeople's schedule and then you\n\n216\n00:10:37.668 --> 00:10:42.283\ncan be able to determine, if that person\nis going to be available that day or not.\n\n217\n00:10:42.283 --> 00:10:44.242\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and click OK.\n\n218\n00:10:44.242 --> 00:10:46.040\nThat looks good.\n\n219\n00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:52.430\nSo I've decided that, that's who I want to\nhave in my meetings and that looks good.\n\n220\n00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:53.287\nHere's my attendees.\n\n221\n00:10:53.287 --> 00:10:56.580\nNow notice that this doesn't just say,\nsave anymore.\n\n222\n00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.870\nThis says, send.\n\n223\n00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:00.954\nBecause who you've added\nas your attendees,\n\n224\n00:11:00.954 --> 00:11:04.688\nthis is going to email out to\nthem this meeting request.\n\n225\n00:11:04.688 --> 00:11:05.671\nSo, that's gonna be pretty nice.\n\n226\n00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:07.410\nWe're gonna go ahead and click Send.\n\n227\n00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:13.740\nOnce that happens, this does go ahead and\ngets added to my calendar right here.\n\n228\n00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.071\nSo I can see that I have\na working lunch scheduled and\n\n229\n00:11:17.071 --> 00:11:22.370\nthat's what's going on my calendar,\nbecause that's what I've determined.\n\n230\n00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:27.270\nNow let's go ahead and\nmove over to Justin's computer and\n\n231\n00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.970\nwe will see that I have got\na meeting request from Joey and\n\n232\n00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.374\nin my inbox, so it comes at.\n\n233\n00:11:34.374 --> 00:11:35.770\nRemember, I'm Justin now.\n\n234\n00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:36.620\nSo, we switched prequel.\n\n235\n00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.785\nI know he's over here,\nbut [LAUGH] the other JT.\n\n236\n00:11:40.785 --> 00:11:45.590\n[LAUGH] So, I'm over here and\nI've got options of do I accept?\n\n237\n00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.268\nDo I tentatively accept?\n\n238\n00:11:47.268 --> 00:11:49.969\nDo I decline or propose a new time?\n\n239\n00:11:49.969 --> 00:11:53.100\nSo, these are some different\noptions that I can have.\n\n240\n00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:53.772\nI can see when it's at.\n\n241\n00:11:53.772 --> 00:11:55.450\nNow, I can come over here.\n\n242\n00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.240\nLet's just see like, all right, yep.\n\n243\n00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.143\nThat looks like it's already\ngonna go on my calendar,\n\n244\n00:12:01.143 --> 00:12:04.310\nbecause I haven't really like\nset anything differently.\n\n245\n00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.770\nBut that's all right.\n\n246\n00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:06.799\nWe're gonna go ahead as say, warm.\n\n247\n00:12:06.799 --> 00:12:09.050\nI could have separate.\n\n248\n00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:12.930\nLet's do a proposed new time just\na kind of up a little bit in here.\n\n249\n00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.360\nShow all of our options.\n\n250\n00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.088\n&gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa, Yvonne.\n\n251\n00:12:16.088 --> 00:12:20.320\nLet me jump in here before we\nget too far ahead of ourselves.\n\n252\n00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.108\nAm I absolutely locked in if I choose\nanyone of these options like if I accept\n\n253\n00:12:25.108 --> 00:12:27.541\nthis time, is that the end all be all?\n\n254\n00:12:27.541 --> 00:12:29.530\nOr can I come back and change this?\n\n255\n00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:30.700\n&gt;&gt; That's actually a really good question.\n\n256\n00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.610\nBecause like you're saying,\nif I accept and\n\n257\n00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:36.760\nthen later think about this,\nyou can come back.\n\n258\n00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.050\nCuz once you've accepted,\nyou're like in the meeting.\n\n259\n00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:43.790\nSo if you made a hey, I need to make\nan adjustment or you delete it off your\n\n260\n00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:48.925\ncalendar or anything to that, then it\nwould go ahead and update the organizer\n\n261\n00:12:48.925 --> 00:12:53.440\nof hey, I need to go ahead and\nmove this around and so on and so forth.\n\n262\n00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.490\nOr even just reply to the meeting\norganizer and say, hey,\n\n263\n00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.661\ncan yo go ahead and make the time change\ndifferently and then they can go ahead and\n\n264\n00:13:00.661 --> 00:13:04.478\nchoose the time to be different and\nthen push out an update to everybody.\n\n265\n00:13:04.478 --> 00:13:07.297\nSo yeah, it's just that kind\nof two-way communication just\n\n266\n00:13:07.297 --> 00:13:08.822\nmake sure that you let them know.\n\n267\n00:13:08.822 --> 00:13:13.428\nAnd then sometimes you as the attendee\ncan change things and sometimes you have\n\n268\n00:13:13.428 --> 00:13:18.460\nto just like email them, and then ask\nthem to change it, and push it out.\n\n269\n00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.256\nSo, good point.\n\n270\n00:13:19.256 --> 00:13:21.660\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthat definitely puts my mind at ease.\n\n271\n00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.630\nCuz I was like commitment.\n\n272\n00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.563\nThat's kind of something,\n[SOUND] I don't know.\n\n273\n00:13:24.563 --> 00:13:26.276\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I don't how I feel about that.\n\n274\n00:13:26.276 --> 00:13:27.764\nBut luckily, we can come back and\nchange that.\n\n275\n00:13:27.764 --> 00:13:31.202\nIt need to be at the very least we have\ncommunicate with another individual in\n\n276\n00:13:31.202 --> 00:13:32.717\norder to get those changes made.\n\n277\n00:13:32.717 --> 00:13:35.160\nSo I feel better about that, Yvonne.\n\n278\n00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.020\nNow, let's go see how we\ncan propose a new time.\n\n279\n00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.092\nSo, I'm not super luck into things.\n\n280\n00:13:40.092 --> 00:13:45.143\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so why don't we come in to\nthe propose new time that was one of our\n\n281\n00:13:45.143 --> 00:13:50.890\noptions and we can tentatively go ahead\nand accept propose time like outcome.\n\n282\n00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:55.120\nBut if you change the time or\nyou can be like no, I'm not coming.\n\n283\n00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.690\nBecause I just won't, but\nI will give you a new time.\n\n284\n00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:02.631\nSo this is kind of one of those like do\nyou want to be nope or just like yeah,\n\n285\n00:14:02.631 --> 00:14:03.390\nmaybe.\n\n286\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.683\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead with\na tentative right here.\n\n287\n00:14:05.683 --> 00:14:10.449\nNow it's gonna bring up this whole\nscheduling and it's nice as Justin,\n\n288\n00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:13.964\nhe can just go ahead and\nsee that scheduling assistant\n\n289\n00:14:13.964 --> 00:14:17.730\nas well where he could see\ndoes Lance have any conflicts?\n\n290\n00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.499\nDoes Joy have any conflicts?\n\n291\n00:14:19.499 --> 00:14:23.902\nSo this scheduling assistant for\npeople of any organizations can be really,\n\n292\n00:14:23.902 --> 00:14:25.120\nreally handy.\n\n293\n00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.460\nBut as we said, only if those\npeople use the calendar properly.\n\n294\n00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:33.450\nSo you can see that I wanna go ahead\nas Justin to propose it at 12.\n\n295\n00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.521\nFrom 12 to 2 and it does keep that,\nit shows that it was,\n\n296\n00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:38.420\nit remembers that it was two hours.\n\n297\n00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.645\nSo it just adjusts and we go ahead,\nand create that new time,\n\n298\n00:14:41.645 --> 00:14:44.128\nand then we're gonna go ahead,\nand click OK.\n\n299\n00:14:44.128 --> 00:14:47.350\nI will say that if you're looking at\nthis like, well, where's the button?\n\n300\n00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:48.571\nBecause of my resolution,\n\n301\n00:14:48.571 --> 00:14:51.020\nI do have to scroll down in\nmy message a little bit more.\n\n302\n00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:56.190\nCuz that's where that is that Send and you\ncan see that I have tentatively accept it.\n\n303\n00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:57.730\nI have proposed a new time.\n\n304\n00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:02.337\nIt was at 11, now it's at 12 and\n\n305\n00:15:02.337 --> 00:15:07.590\nI can say like this is better for\nme as JT.\n\n306\n00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.453\nSo I will go ahead and\nsend that off to Joey,\n\n307\n00:15:10.453 --> 00:15:15.152\ncuz we are going through our different\noptions as a person that's been\n\n308\n00:15:15.152 --> 00:15:18.354\ninvited to a meeting as\nwhat we're going to do.\n\n309\n00:15:18.354 --> 00:15:21.796\nSo let's go ahead and\njust jump back over here to Joey and\n\n310\n00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:26.484\nwhat Joey is gonna get as you can see\nright here with our working launch is that\n\n311\n00:15:26.484 --> 00:15:29.268\nthere is a message from\nJustin Timberlake and\n\n312\n00:15:29.268 --> 00:15:34.340\nthat he has said, he has tentatively\naccepted and propose a new time.\n\n313\n00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.346\nWell, I've got that.\n\n314\n00:15:35.346 --> 00:15:36.780\nAnd don't worry about the lensing.\n\n315\n00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.733\nI was testing something out.\n\n316\n00:15:37.733 --> 00:15:38.374\nIt's fine.\n\n317\n00:15:38.374 --> 00:15:41.190\nThat shouldn't have been tha, been there.\n\n318\n00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:45.426\nBut because I have my messages shown\nas where it is showing deleted items in\n\n319\n00:15:45.426 --> 00:15:47.697\na conversation, that's why this is.\n\n320\n00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:49.720\nSo it's one of those, what's that Justin?\n\n321\n00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.120\nA little hand wave right there.\n\n322\n00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.800\n&gt;&gt; Nothing to see here.\n\n323\n00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.584\nDon't look at the man behind the curtain.\n\n324\n00:15:55.584 --> 00:15:56.703\nWe're all good to go.\n\n325\n00:15:56.703 --> 00:16:00.417\nJust pretend it's not there and more focus\non the going forward workflow, because\n\n326\n00:16:00.417 --> 00:16:04.042\nthat's ultimately what you're gonna see\nwhen you're trying to get this done.\n\n327\n00:16:04.042 --> 00:16:04.717\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n328\n00:16:04.717 --> 00:16:06.081\nI do this All the time.\n\n329\n00:16:06.081 --> 00:16:08.415\nAnd I always coin Justin's hand wave.\n\n330\n00:16:08.415 --> 00:16:10.263\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n331\n00:16:10.263 --> 00:16:12.566\n&gt;&gt; So we've got that Justin has proposed,\n\n332\n00:16:12.566 --> 00:16:13.791\nand like maybe as me.\n\n333\n00:16:13.791 --> 00:16:16.818\nNow remember, I'm back at Joey,\ndoing a lot of flip flopping here.\n\n334\n00:16:16.818 --> 00:16:19.044\nBut as Joey, I'm like, you know what?\n\n335\n00:16:19.044 --> 00:16:22.942\nThat sounds good, I can go for 12 to 2.\n\n336\n00:16:22.942 --> 00:16:26.037\nSo I will go ahead and\nclick on that little edit event.\n\n337\n00:16:26.037 --> 00:16:31.454\nAnd me as the meeting organizer, I'll go\nahead and propose, yup that sounds good.\n\n338\n00:16:31.454 --> 00:16:34.765\nLet's go ahead and\nchange that to 12 o'clock.\n\n339\n00:16:34.765 --> 00:16:39.671\nAnd notice that I can see some other\nstatus things happening right now with my\n\n340\n00:16:39.671 --> 00:16:43.610\ndifferent invitees or\nattendees, we will call them.\n\n341\n00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.680\nAnd we will go ahead and send that out.\n\n342\n00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:51.990\nSo why don't we go ahead and look over\nat to what Lance is seeing right now?\n\n343\n00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.160\nWe'll come over here.\n\n344\n00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.490\nAnd so now I'm Lance,\n\n345\n00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:59.995\nand I can see that we have\na working lunch that's got in here.\n\n346\n00:16:59.995 --> 00:17:03.084\nAnd remember, there's been a couple\nother things that's happened,\n\n347\n00:17:03.084 --> 00:17:06.584\nbecause I'm all over the place going on\nto where Justin's already went ahead and\n\n348\n00:17:06.584 --> 00:17:07.680\nresponded back to Joey.\n\n349\n00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.181\nJoey proposed a new time, and\nnow Lance is actually getting that.\n\n350\n00:17:11.181 --> 00:17:17.481\nAnd you can see, as Lance, I can see that\nhey, it was originally scheduled for\n\n351\n00:17:17.481 --> 00:17:21.509\n11 to 1, but\nit's got a strike through there.\n\n352\n00:17:21.509 --> 00:17:25.922\nAnd then I can see that\nthe new time is 12 to 2.\n\n353\n00:17:25.922 --> 00:17:30.950\nAll right, well as Lance, I might be like,\nokay yeah, that sounds good.\n\n354\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.590\nAnd I could go ahead and\naccept that invitation.\n\n355\n00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.530\nSo if I go ahead and click accept.\n\n356\n00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:41.840\nNow notice I could go ahead and just edit\nthe response before sending like say,\n\n357\n00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.650\nhey, that sounds great,\nI'm really looking forward to it.\n\n358\n00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:45.771\nOr I can just go ahead and respond.\n\n359\n00:17:45.771 --> 00:17:48.559\nI don't have to add\na comment if you wanna say.\n\n360\n00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:51.316\nI don't wanna have to\nadd any note to that, or\n\n361\n00:17:51.316 --> 00:17:53.719\nI could just don't send the response.\n\n362\n00:17:53.719 --> 00:17:56.965\nI'm not sure if that would do much good\nif you're being invited to a meeting, and\n\n363\n00:17:56.965 --> 00:17:58.570\nthen you just don't respond.\n\n364\n00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.060\nThat's not very nice, now is it, Justin?\n\n365\n00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.641\n&gt;&gt; No, and\nI don't think that's gonna be helpful.\n\n366\n00:18:01.641 --> 00:18:04.993\nIt's kind of like well, I'm not even\ngonna dignify that with a response.\n\n367\n00:18:04.993 --> 00:18:07.822\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I would recommend that when you're\n\n368\n00:18:07.822 --> 00:18:11.570\ntrying to get everybody together,\nyou should always respond to these.\n\n369\n00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:15.650\nEven though I don't use calendars for\nmy own personal appointments that well\n\n370\n00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.610\nI do try to respond to\nthings that I'm invited to.\n\n371\n00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:21.300\nEven if I'm not going to attend, and\nthat's just to let everybody know like,\n\n372\n00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.500\nhey, organizer of the meeting,\nI'm coming, everybody else,\n\n373\n00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.970\nthey're coming, things of that nature.\n\n374\n00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:31.080\nSo it's just being considerate\nof other individuals.\n\n375\n00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:34.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I respect that you're using\nthis as a way of organizing yourself.\n\n376\n00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.300\nSo I'll go ahead and play along, cuz\nthat's what you probably should always do.\n\n377\n00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.259\nSo we're gonna go ahead and send that\nresponse, and it just goes right to it.\n\n378\n00:18:43.259 --> 00:18:45.770\nLet's go ahead and switch on back over.\n\n379\n00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.690\nLook, I even got a little\nalert right up there.\n\n380\n00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.090\nJust like we have on our local versions.\n\n381\n00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:53.730\nHey, Lance has accepted my working lunch.\n\n382\n00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:54.870\nOkay, great.\n\n383\n00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.400\nLet's come back over to as Joey, remember,\n\n384\n00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.070\nmeeting organizer,\ncome on over here to my calendar.\n\n385\n00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:05.290\nGoing over into this meeting and\nI'm opening this up, and\n\n386\n00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:08.380\nyou can see down here in\nthe attendees that, yup.\n\n387\n00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.640\nLance has decided to accept,\nthat's awesome.\n\n388\n00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.150\nNow why does Justin say no response?\n\n389\n00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.531\nI thought he had already gone ahead and\nproposed a new meeting time?\n\n390\n00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:21.522\nHe did, but remember, Joey came back and\n\n391\n00:19:21.522 --> 00:19:26.438\nedited that meeting and\nhas sent out that new time.\n\n392\n00:19:26.438 --> 00:19:32.591\nAnd so that's why there's a no response\nthere, because Justin has not responded or\n\n393\n00:19:32.591 --> 00:19:37.290\naccepted that new meeting time that,\nthat well, he proposed.\n\n394\n00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:38.430\nSo that's what we've got there.\n\n395\n00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:41.200\nAnd that's where you can go ahead and\nsee, did somebody decline,\n\n396\n00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.790\ndid somebody not respond,\ndid somebody accept?\n\n397\n00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:46.780\nAnd that's where you could sort by them.\n\n398\n00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:47.800\nNow we're gonna go ahead and\n\n399\n00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.050\nhave this particular example,\neverybody's gonna play nice.\n\n400\n00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.647\nLet's just jump on over here to JT, and\n\n401\n00:19:53.647 --> 00:19:58.866\nwhen we have JT's working lunch he's\ngonna see the same thing that Lance did.\n\n402\n00:19:58.866 --> 00:20:01.799\nThis is where since he proposed the new\ntime he should probably go ahead\n\n403\n00:20:01.799 --> 00:20:02.353\nand accept.\n\n404\n00:20:02.353 --> 00:20:05.050\nThat wouldn't be very nice if he\nthen went ahead and declined it.\n\n405\n00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:09.950\nBut strangers things have happened.\n\n406\n00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:12.390\nWe will edit the response before sending.\n\n407\n00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:18.880\nAnd we'll say, thanks,\nsee you soon and smiley face.\n\n408\n00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.210\nAnd then we will send that.\n\n409\n00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:25.620\nGoes ahead and\nputs that back over to Joey.\n\n410\n00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.800\nYou can see that I've got\nan email coming back into him, so\n\n411\n00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:35.330\nnow I know that everybody has accepted my\nmeeting request, and everybody's gone in.\n\n412\n00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.970\nAnd the nice thing is that, I don't\nknow if I specifically spelled it out or\n\n413\n00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.100\nmaybe I did, and I just don't remember.\n\n414\n00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.250\nBut as somebody is being invited\ninto the meeting, when Justin and\n\n415\n00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.120\nLance accepted it.\n\n416\n00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.520\nIt automatically was\nadded to their calendars.\n\n417\n00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.230\nSo just to show you back over in Lance.\n\n418\n00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.060\nThat I never really was going\nover to Lance's calendar, but\n\n419\n00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:00.450\nyou can see now that working lunch\nhas been added to the calendar.\n\n420\n00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:04.290\nThat's the whole nice thing about like\nusing these emails that is connected\n\n421\n00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:06.080\ndirectly to your calendar.\n\n422\n00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.090\nAnd so you accept,\nit gets put on all that wonderful stuff.\n\n423\n00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:12.790\nNow let's just say, as Joey.\n\n424\n00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:17.342\nJoey, as the organizer realizes,\nyou know what?\n\n425\n00:21:17.342 --> 00:21:18.969\nI'm sorry guys, I'm gonna have to cancel.\n\n426\n00:21:18.969 --> 00:21:23.729\nI know I went ahead and did this meeting\nrequest, but I need to go ahead and\n\n427\n00:21:23.729 --> 00:21:27.390\nnot have this happen just\nbecause things happen.\n\n428\n00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:32.130\nSo the nice thing as the organizer,\ncoming over here to my working lunch,\n\n429\n00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.100\nif I cancel this or delete this.\n\n430\n00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:35.930\nLet's go ahead and open it.\n\n431\n00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:39.780\nOkay, and then we are going to cancel.\n\n432\n00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.780\nNow notice, I did wanna come\ninto the event details, so\n\n433\n00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:47.500\nthat way you would probably wanna\ngo ahead and send the cancellation.\n\n434\n00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.090\nNow maybe you wanna edit it and say,\nhey guys, so sorry I can't make it.\n\n435\n00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:55.675\nJust sending a cancel request\nwithout an explanation,\n\n436\n00:21:55.675 --> 00:21:58.279\ntalk about that kind of consideration.\n\n437\n00:21:58.279 --> 00:22:04.140\nAnd a little common courtesy that\nmight be sorry, something came up.\n\n438\n00:22:06.551 --> 00:22:11.800\nI will reschedule soon.\n\n439\n00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:16.160\nDon't look at my typing capabilities and\ngrammar and punctuation,\n\n440\n00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.260\nit's not very good.\n\n441\n00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.277\nSo we've got that.\n\n442\n00:22:18.277 --> 00:22:21.936\nWe go ahead and send out this message.\n\n443\n00:22:21.936 --> 00:22:25.170\nNotice that,\nlook what's happened on Joey's calendar.\n\n444\n00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.790\nJoey's, it's off of the calendar.\n\n445\n00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:34.230\nCome on over here to JT, I can see that\nyup, sorry, this has been cancelled.\n\n446\n00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:38.070\nAnd the nice thing is that right there,\nlook at from somebody that is an invitee\n\n447\n00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:41.270\nor an attendee of this, I can go ahead and\nremove it from my calendar.\n\n448\n00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:44.202\nAnd guess what do you\nthink that's gonna happen?\n\n449\n00:22:44.202 --> 00:22:46.952\nYeah, gonna remove it from JT's calendar.\n\n450\n00:22:46.952 --> 00:22:53.720\nAnd now I see that I do not have anything\non the 25th, which is quite lovely.\n\n451\n00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:59.300\nAnd then something else is gonna happen,\nas somebody that's being invited,\n\n452\n00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.522\nall of those emails that were back and\nforth.\n\n453\n00:23:02.522 --> 00:23:03.985\nThere no longer there,\n\n454\n00:23:03.985 --> 00:23:08.965\nthat's actually a setting that I believe\nwe went over in the counter interface.\n\n455\n00:23:08.965 --> 00:23:11.010\nBut I just wanted to go ahead and\njust double check, so\n\n456\n00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:12.245\nyou guys can see where it's at.\n\n457\n00:23:12.245 --> 00:23:17.215\nIt's all the way at the bottom of our\nsettings and we come into calendar.\n\n458\n00:23:17.215 --> 00:23:21.897\nAnd on the calendar, it's over here\nin the automatic processing and\n\n459\n00:23:21.897 --> 00:23:23.522\nthen the invitations.\n\n460\n00:23:23.522 --> 00:23:27.840\nAnd notice it says delete invitations and\nresponse that have been updated.\n\n461\n00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.120\nSo the whole updating and the cancellation\nof that meeting is gonna go ahead and\n\n462\n00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.600\ntake those responses out of your inbox.\n\n463\n00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.650\nSo if you're going back and looking like,\nI know this was part of it.\n\n464\n00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:41.387\nIt was deleted, and that's your setting.\n\n465\n00:23:41.387 --> 00:23:44.339\nSo if you don't want that,\nyou can uncheck it.\n\n466\n00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:47.967\nNow all of these meetings options\nthat we have and responses,\n\n467\n00:23:47.967 --> 00:23:50.380\nthese all does work with outlook.com.\n\n468\n00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.159\nSo just know that everything\nI've been showing you,\n\n469\n00:23:53.159 --> 00:23:55.022\neven all the settings are the same.\n\n470\n00:23:55.022 --> 00:23:59.366\nAnd so, you can see that setting up\na meeting or requesting a meeting or\n\n471\n00:23:59.366 --> 00:24:02.618\neven being Invited,\nis actually pretty seamless.\n\n472\n00:24:02.618 --> 00:24:03.980\nYou get those emails.\n\n473\n00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.410\nYou can see you've been invited.\n\n474\n00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:06.970\nYou go ahead and make your responses.\n\n475\n00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:08.760\nThere's all this back and forth.\n\n476\n00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.040\nIt's all somewhat automatic\nbecause it's all connected.\n\n477\n00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:17.545\nYou can See the real power of using\nOutlook to organize yourself and\n\n478\n00:24:17.545 --> 00:24:20.945\nusing the calendar to its advantage and\ntying in with the email.\n\n479\n00:24:20.945 --> 00:24:22.325\nIt can be really, really handy.\n\n480\n00:24:22.325 --> 00:24:27.575\nSo I hope this is a nice demonstration\nto show you that it is pretty simple.\n\n481\n00:24:27.575 --> 00:24:28.735\nAnd you can follow along.\n\n482\n00:24:28.735 --> 00:24:29.985\nAnd you can go ahead and make so\n\n483\n00:24:29.985 --> 00:24:32.530\nmany

too.\n\n486\n00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.120\nThat's how we work here\nin an office setting.\n\n487\n00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.390\nYou want to have that communication.\n\n488\n00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:46.320\nSometimes, it's good to have\na meeting just to have a meeting.\n\n489\n00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.700\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if I can agree with it.\n\n490\n00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.680\nI definitely want a t shirt, I just\nsupervised a meeting that could have been\n\n491\n00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.460\nan email thing, but But\nthere are wonderful ways to,\n\n492\n00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.670\nwell, make sure everybody's\norganized on the same plan.\n\n493\n00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:02.730\nAlso what I like about\nthe meetings whether I can

00:25:08.780\nHey, yeah, I have a meeting tomorrow.\n\n497\n00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.480\nSo that is something that I engage on\neven if I don't keep my own personal\n\n498\n00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.940\nappointments in check.\n\n499\n00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:17.830\nSo bond thank you very much for\ndemonstrating how to essentially herd cats\n\n500\n00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:21.730\nand we do

Wow, I have a plan?\n\n10\n00:00:36.198 --> 00:00:37.631\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I sure hope so, cuz I don't.\n\n11\n00:00:37.631 --> 00:00:41.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, but you are correct.\n\n12\n00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.001\nSo you only get the things that people\nshare with you, like a meeting request and\n\n13\n00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:46.080\nlike here's my calendar.\n\n14\n00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI feel like I'm the calendar creeper.\n\n15\n00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.060\nSo I just add people's calendars\nthat I know are organized, and\n\n16\n00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.670\nthen I just watch their calendars.\n\n17\n00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.660\nAnd then I don't really have\nto maintain my own calendars,\n\n18\n00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.270\nand hopefully they're always public.\n\n19\n00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.325\nBut that's what I do and it's not failed\nme, but maybe six, seven, eight times.\n\n20\n00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:08.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's like\norganization through osmosis?\n\n21\n00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's vicarious organizational practices.\n\n22\n00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.250\nI should coin that term.\n\n23\n00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.510\n&gt;&gt; I know, I like that.\n\n24\n00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n25\n00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.764\n&gt;&gt; But that's how I roll, Vonne.\n\n26\n00:01:16.764 --> 00:01:17.492\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like that.\n\n27\n00:01:17.492 --> 00:01:20.710\nIf it's working for you,\nyou keep on going with that.\n\n28\n00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.280\nSo we're gonna-\n&gt;&gt; Toot toot.\n\n29\n00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.280\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n30\n00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.270\nSo we're gonna go ahead and show you guys\nhow you could share your calendar with\n\n31\n00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.030\nJustin and\nhe can watch you vicariously and\n\n32\n00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.440\norganize himself based on what\nyou [LAUGH] have for him.\n\n33\n00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.536\nSo why don't we go through\nsome different options now.\n\n34\n00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:44.390\nWe're gonna go over adding calendars\nthat are more like the view only type\n\n35\n00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.150\nthings to where I wanna see\nother people's calendars but\n\n36\n00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.960\nI don't necessarily have\npermissions to actually using them.\n\n37\n00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.020\nSo adding versus sharing, but\nit's all kind of sharing.\n\n38\n00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.177\nSo it depends on how you\nwanna use the terminology,\n\n39\n00:02:00.177 --> 00:02:03.124\ncuz I'm going to let you\nsee this kind of stuff.\n\n40\n00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:06.094\nBut when we get into\ndelegating authority for\n\n41\n00:02:06.094 --> 00:02:11.010\nsomebody else to control our calendar,\nthat gets into a different area.\n\n42\n00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.300\nSo those are gonna be the things that were\ngonna talk about in this whole episode\n\n43\n00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.990\nunder share calendars.\n\n44\n00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.381\nAnd so we're gonna attack it from\na couple of different angles.\n\n45\n00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:22.830\nAnd we'll do both the paid version and\nthe free version.\n\n46\n00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.320\n&gt;&gt; It seems like sharing here is kind\nof like using the colloquial word,\n\n47\n00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.350\nfor me anyway, borrow.\n\n48\n00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.800\nHey, can I borrow that piece of paper?\n\n49\n00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.820\nAre you going to give me\nback a piece of paper?\n\n50\n00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.258\nOr can I borrow some money with\nthe intent of paying back?\n\n51\n00:02:36.258 --> 00:02:38.925\nEh, it's used, depending on context,\n\n52\n00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:42.747\nwe have a little bit different\nkind of workflow so to speak.\n\n53\n00:02:42.747 --> 00:02:44.945\nAnd that's kind of the vibe\nthat I'm getting here, Vonne.\n\n54\n00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:45.815\nIs that a correct vibe?\n\n55\n00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:49.165\n&gt;&gt; Somewhat, I'm thinking more of like,\nhere, let me look at your homework.\n\n56\n00:02:49.165 --> 00:02:51.735\nLet me just look at it and then I'm gonna,\nI'm just gonna take it and\n\n57\n00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:53.560\nactually copy your homework.\n\n58\n00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.115\n&gt;&gt; Or I'll do your homework for\nyou and you pay me.\n\n59\n00:02:58.115 --> 00:02:59.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wow.\n\n60\n00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.355\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like a vicarious\norganizational practice.\n\n61\n00:03:01.355 --> 00:03:03.571\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n62\n00:03:03.571 --> 00:03:06.537\nSo it's one of those, you know what, I\nthink it's gonna be easiest if I just show\n\n63\n00:03:06.537 --> 00:03:08.600\nyou and then that way you're like, okay.\n\n64\n00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.360\nI see what word we could go ahead and\nuse for that one.\n\n65\n00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.890\nSo we've got our Joey calendar down here.\n\n66\n00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.570\nAnd this is where we've been\ncreating different events.\n\n67\n00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.135\nWe've been scheduling appointments and\n\n68\n00:03:19.135 --> 00:03:21.710\ncreating meetings and\nall that wonderful stuff.\n\n69\n00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.120\nSo we're gonna explore this add\ncalendar button first of all.\n\n70\n00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.569\nWe did talk about this\ninteresting calendar that,\n\n71\n00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.990\nI of course added my Tampa Bay Lighting\nto my interesting calendars that Bing\n\n72\n00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.370\nhas decided that it will share with me.\n\n73\n00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.514\nBut we're gonna go over here to\nadding a secondary calendar.\n\n74\n00:03:40.514 --> 00:03:44.450\nNow this is something to where\nI have multiple calendars,\n\n75\n00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.520\nnow my multiple calendars come from\nthe different platforms that I'm on.\n\n76\n00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.230\nI have my Google Calendar,\nI have my work calendar.\n\n77\n00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.456\nI also have my calendar that comes\non my iPhone, my iCalendar or\n\n78\n00:03:54.456 --> 00:03:57.982\nwhat have you, so\nmine's more platform specific.\n\n79\n00:03:57.982 --> 00:04:03.524\nBut if you think about somebody that has\nto organize multiple things in their life,\n\n80\n00:04:03.524 --> 00:04:07.246\nnot just their work meetings,\nmaybe their meetings for\n\n81\n00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:10.268\ntheir cats because their\ncats are show cats.\n\n82\n00:04:10.268 --> 00:04:15.029\nAnd they have a whole schedule of\nevents that have to be attained to, or\n\n83\n00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:18.840\nthey have to attend, and\nyou have to keep them on track.\n\n84\n00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.530\nYou know, you traveling cats,\ncuz you have some of those, right?\n\n85\n00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe'll go with I have some of those.\n\n86\n00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.460\nThat seems to have escalated in\nan alternative direction than I\n\n87\n00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.970\nhad originally planned.\n\n88\n00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.054\nBut yes, I own show cats.\n\n89\n00:04:31.054 --> 00:04:33.151\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] They're very pretty.\n\n90\n00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:34.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n91\n00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.270\n&gt;&gt; So those are different\n\n92\n00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.890\nreasons why you might want to\nseparate out different calendars.\n\n93\n00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.350\nBecause your work people need\nonly see their work stuff and\n\n94\n00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.990\nnot your show cats schedule and\nthings like that nature.\n\n95\n00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.320\nSo if you just come over\nhere to secondary calendar,\n\n96\n00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.980\nnotice over here on the left hand side\non our calendar list we can go ahead and\n\n97\n00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.640\ntype in, show cats, and then there we go.\n\n98\n00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.200\nWe hit Enter and now I have a secondary\ncalendar that I can go ahead and\n\n99\n00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.364\nstart adding in different events for\nthat particular thing.\n\n100\n00:05:04.364 --> 00:05:07.290\nSo separating out my responsibilities.\n\n101\n00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.404\nAnd that's how we can go ahead and\ndo that.\n\n102\n00:05:10.404 --> 00:05:14.148\nNow if you wanted to ever delete that\ncalendar, maybe the cats have retired,\n\n103\n00:05:14.148 --> 00:05:15.310\nthey're off the road.\n\n104\n00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.403\nAnd so you could go ahead and\nright-click on there and\n\n105\n00:05:18.403 --> 00:05:21.580\nyou could delete that secondary\ncalendar if you want.\n\n106\n00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.401\nFor now let's just keep it open or\nkeep it there just for fun and\n\n107\n00:05:26.401 --> 00:05:30.495\njust because we can keep\non talking about show cats.\n\n108\n00:05:30.495 --> 00:05:32.513\nSo that's how you can add a secondary.\n\n109\n00:05:32.513 --> 00:05:34.393\nYou can have a tertiary, a quad,\n\n110\n00:05:34.393 --> 00:05:38.240\nyou can just keep on adding as many\ndifferent calendars as you want.\n\n111\n00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.245\n&gt;&gt; Quaternary-\n&gt;&gt; Is that what it is?\n\n112\n00:05:40.245 --> 00:05:43.990\n&gt;&gt; I think it is quaternary, yeah,\nthat's the fourth, yes, I think so.\n\n113\n00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.454\n&gt;&gt; Okay. I knew- &gt;&gt; I think so,\ndon't quote me on that.\n\n114\n00:05:46.454 --> 00:05:48.847\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I know about tertiary colors,\nbut then I was like,\n\n115\n00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:50.313\nI don't know what's past that.\n\n116\n00:05:50.313 --> 00:05:53.515\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Post tertiary,we're gonna go with that.\n\n117\n00:05:53.515 --> 00:05:58.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Perfect, so there are some\nother ways that you can add calendars.\n\n118\n00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.820\nLet's look at these other options.\n\n119\n00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.520\nWe did talk about holiday calendar, and\n\n120\n00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.230\nthat's more of a setting that you can say,\nyep add to holidays.\n\n121\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.990\nWhich I've already done.\n\n122\n00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.150\nNow the other three we have,\nfile, Internet, and directory.\n\n123\n00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.670\nLet's talk about the directory.\n\n124\n00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.520\nThis is something that if you are in\na network environment, that you are like,\n\n125\n00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.840\nOffice Pro Demo Co.\n\n126\n00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.850\nYou have access to other people's calendar\n\n127\n00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.640\neven if they didn't give\nyou permission to see it.\n\n128\n00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.030\nAgain, that was the kind\nof viewing level versus\n\n129\n00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.720\nbeing able to control\nsomebody else's calendar.\n\n130\n00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.060\nTwo different levels.\n\n131\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.770\nAnd if you are on a network environment,\nyou can open anybody'.\n\n132\n00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.605\nI know when I was back at the university\nI could open up anybody's calendar in\n\n133\n00:06:38.605 --> 00:06:40.580\nthe entire global directory.\n\n134\n00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.286\nNow I don't see all of the details,\na lot of it I just saw as busy or\n\n135\n00:06:44.286 --> 00:06:47.740\ntentative, and I'll show you\nwhen we go ahead and do that.\n\n136\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.270\nWhy don't I do it while I'm talking?\n\n137\n00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.250\nSo I'll say let's go ahead and\nopen up Lance's calendar,\n\n138\n00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.120\ncuz he is part of Office Pro Demo Co.\n\n139\n00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.460\nAnd then I go ahead and open it.\n\n140\n00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.620\nAnd it does open up as\na separate calendar.\n\n141\n00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.120\nYou can see now it can be\nother calendars section.\n\n142\n00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.940\nAnd I can see Lance's.\n\n143\n00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.902\nNow I see, look, tentative, busy.\n\n144\n00:07:05.902 --> 00:07:09.520\nI don't see like the name of\nthe appointment or the meeting.\n\n145\n00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.160\nI just see it to me as what the status\nthat they chose to mark for\n\n146\n00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.910\nthat particular event.\n\n147\n00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.940\nAnd that's where we talked about the away\nand out of the office amd those different\n\n148\n00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.560\nthings and\njust like how the status is going to be.\n\n149\n00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.270\nNow you're not gonna see private\nappointments or meetings because,\n\n150\n00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.150\nwell, that's private.\n\n151\n00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.034\nSo just kinda know that if your networked,\npeople will see your calendar.\n\n152\n00:07:35.034 --> 00:07:37.099\nNow they don't see details but\n\n153\n00:07:37.099 --> 00:07:42.110\njust be aware that it is a setting that\nhappens in a networked environment.\n\n154\n00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.480\nSo that's something.\n\n155\n00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.349\nNow this particular option is not\navailable in the outlook.com.\n\n156\n00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:50.945\nHere, let me just jump over there\nreally quick to show you that we only\n\n157\n00:07:50.945 --> 00:07:52.500\nhave from file and Internet.\n\n158\n00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:57.268\nSo these next two options that I'm\ngonna show you back on Joey's account,\n\n159\n00:07:57.268 --> 00:08:00.383\nit does work for\nthe outlook.com users as well.\n\n160\n00:08:00.383 --> 00:08:06.833\nSo from file, from Internet We talked\nabout this in the last episode.\n\n161\n00:08:06.833 --> 00:08:10.360\nThere just the ISC, ICS files.\n\n162\n00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.410\nI always flip those.\n\n163\n00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.910\nSo the ICS files when I was forwarding\nan appointment and it didn’t add and\n\n164\n00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.330\ntalked about people send you calendars and\neverything.\n\n165\n00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.615\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that’s essentially the only way\nthat my official calendar ends up with\n\n166\n00:08:23.615 --> 00:08:26.698\ncalendar events on it is that, hey\nare you gonna come to this meeting and or\n\n167\n00:08:26.698 --> 00:08:29.361\nappointment, I was like well I\nwasn't really planning on it.\n\n168\n00:08:29.361 --> 00:08:30.383\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But since you've\n\n169\n00:08:30.383 --> 00:08:33.752\nwent through the formality of\nsending me a calendar invite and\n\n170\n00:08:33.752 --> 00:08:38.120\nall I have to do is say accept, and then\nI get a reminder on my particular device.\n\n171\n00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.760\nIt's usually through my phone, every once\nin a while I'll get a reminder through my\n\n172\n00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.530\nweb interface if my email is open or\nsomething like that.\n\n173\n00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.051\nJust like a little pop over.\n\n174\n00:08:46.051 --> 00:08:51.031\nIt is handy, it's really someone\nI should buckle down but\n\n175\n00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:55.229\nI definitely like\nbi-curious organizations.\n\n176\n00:08:55.229 --> 00:08:58.586\n&gt;&gt; So some may might have forwarded you\nan appointment and you're like okay,\n\n177\n00:08:58.586 --> 00:09:01.372\nI see it and there we go,\nI'm gonna live my life through them.\n\n178\n00:09:01.372 --> 00:09:04.710\n[LAUGH] So there's different\nways in that ICS file format.\n\n179\n00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:09.990\nIt's a generic file format\nthat a lot of different\n\n180\n00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.270\nemailing clients, whether a Gmail or\nyahoo or what have you,\n\n181\n00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:19.200\nit's kinda like a jpeg file in a sense\nlike for images, it's a universal file\n\n182\n00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.040\nformat that is not platform specific or\na vendor specific.\n\n183\n00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.460\nAnybody and\neverybody can read that particular file.\n\n184\n00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.390\nSo, they kind of all work together.\n\n185\n00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:34.340\nIt's also like a CSV file, comma separated\nvalue file, and that's a lot of stuff.\n\n186\n00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.375\nI know you worked on a lot of\ndatabases and things like that, so\n\n187\n00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:38.384\nthat's something I'm sure\nyou're pretty familiar with.\n\n188\n00:09:38.384 --> 00:09:41.264\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all of these file formats,\nthey always have their\n\n189\n00:09:41.264 --> 00:09:45.595\nspecific either internal format, or maybe\nthey have some headers that describe it.\n\n190\n00:09:45.595 --> 00:09:51.315\nBut, I've used several calendar\napplications and see as always, it always\n\n191\n00:09:51.315 --> 00:09:57.039\nworks flawlessly for me, your knowledge\nmay vary, but for me it looks good.\n\n192\n00:09:57.039 --> 00:09:57.730\nLet's go with it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] exactly,\n\n193\n00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.180\nand now how you get that file format?\n\n194\n00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.560\nNow, this is something that in the outlook\n2016 series we talked about importing and\n\n195\n00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.060\nexporting and that's really kind of where\nwe're going right now in a sense it's\n\n196\n00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:12.230\nimporting somebody else's\nfile that they have exported.\n\n197\n00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.690\nSo let me show you now, this ICS file.\n\n198\n00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:18.040\nI actually popped over here to\nChris's account that I created.\n\n199\n00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.690\nI created Google account for\n\n200\n00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.480\nhim, just to be able to have\nsome different options here.\n\n201\n00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.440\nThis is not a show about Google\ncalendars and how you work with them.\n\n202\n00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.330\nThey have their own intricacies.\n\n203\n00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.760\nBut over here in the Chris Kirkpatrick,\n\n204\n00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.190\nif I dropped us down and\ngo over to the calendar settings,\n\n205\n00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:40.835\nI can get into different things that I\ncan do with this particular calendar and\n\n206\n00:10:40.835 --> 00:10:44.714\nnotice right down here I have\nexporting and look at what it says.\n\n207\n00:10:44.714 --> 00:10:48.476\nExport this in a ICS file.\n\n208\n00:10:48.476 --> 00:10:49.440\nPerfect.\n\n209\n00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.370\nSo that would then go ahead and download,\nand I actually have my file directory up\n\n210\n00:10:54.370 --> 00:11:00.320\nhere into my Downloads folder that was in\na zip folder and then I unzipped it and so\n\n211\n00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:08.380\nhere is that particular ICS, that I file\nright there for us to be able to bring in.\n\n212\n00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:12.260\nSo I'm just gonna come on over here,\noops, that's the wrong button.\n\n213\n00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.040\nHow about we go ahead and\nclick the tab and bring in from file.\n\n214\n00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.420\nIt's just gonna ask you,\nwell tell me where that file is located.\n\n215\n00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.220\nAll right, so this part's really easy.\n\n216\n00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.200\nIt's getting the person, or either you or\n\n217\n00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.470\nsomeone else to get you that file,\nthat might take a little bit of steps.\n\n218\n00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:29.350\nSo we gonna go ahead and\n\n219\n00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:33.520\nbrowse it out to, that's it's already\nin a directory that I was in before.\n\n220\n00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.340\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and open it.\n\n221\n00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.170\nNow notice it's this is where\nhaving those different calendars\n\n222\n00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.230\nis gonna make a difference.\n\n223\n00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.180\nBecause this is gonna be kind of one\nof those like hey put a big kind of\n\n224\n00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.010\nasterisk on this one, asterisk says\nis like this is a good note for you,\n\n225\n00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:54.230\nis that when I import a calendar\nfrom an ICS file format.\n\n226\n00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:59.390\nIt's going to basically merge\ninto whatever calendar I choose.\n\n227\n00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:04.240\nIt's not going to import and\nmake its own separate calendar,\n\n228\n00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.710\nit's gonna come over here in my list.\n\n229\n00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.807\nThis isn't gonna say Chris calendar and\nbe separate,\n\n230\n00:12:09.807 --> 00:12:12.305\nI have to choose which\none I want to bring in.\n\n231\n00:12:12.305 --> 00:12:16.967\nNow this is one of those points where if\nI have my default calendar selected, and\n\n232\n00:12:16.967 --> 00:12:21.281\nChris has a ton of stuff, it's gonna\ncome and merge directly into mine and\n\n233\n00:12:21.281 --> 00:12:22.394\nan asterisk like,\n\n234\n00:12:22.394 --> 00:12:26.660\nthis is the thing I'm always struggling\nwith in all of these episodes.\n\n235\n00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.210\nWho am I?\n\n236\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:27.870\nWhich appointment?\n\n237\n00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:28.527\nAm I Chris?\n\n238\n00:12:28.527 --> 00:12:31.510\nAm I, who is this, Joey?\n\n239\n00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:32.501\nThose types of things,\n\n240\n00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:35.880\nso you gotta be really careful about which\ncalendar you're gonna bring it into.\n\n241\n00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.910\nSo that's one of those hey,\n\n242\n00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:44.750\nmaybe create a secondary calendar first,\nmake it blank, bring in somebody's stuff,\n\n243\n00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.550\nand that way, if you don't like it, you\ncould always just trash it out instead of\n\n244\n00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:51.570\ntrying to pick through individual\nstuff in your calendar.\n\n245\n00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:52.910\nThat might be a lot of work.\n\n246\n00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:58.800\nSo, I'm gonna choose the show cats on that\nparticular option, now our blending show\n\n247\n00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.580\ncats with Chris' Gmail and everything and\nwe're going off the rails.\n\n248\n00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.560\nJust like always.\n\n249\n00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.440\nSo we're going to save this and\n\n250\n00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.530\nnotice that if I come over\ninto my show cats calendar.\n\n251\n00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.470\nAnd let's say I'm off Lance's calendar.\n\n252\n00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:17.010\nThese were the ones, I just put a few\ndifferent events there in Chris' calendar\n\n253\n00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:21.900\nto see, yeah, it went ahead and\nbrought it all in.\n\n254\n00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.110\nSo the ICS, it's a hard import in a sense.\n\n255\n00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.480\nIt's gonna merge whatever\ncalendar you have selected.\n\n256\n00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.669\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, let me ask a question.\n\n257\n00:13:28.669 --> 00:13:30.470\nI know you said put a big old asterisk,\n\n258\n00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.380\nI'm thinking post-It note\non the side of my screen.\n\n259\n00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:37.319\nCuz this seems like something I would do,\nif I did accidentally do this,\n\n260\n00:13:37.319 --> 00:13:41.582\ndo I have to go and delete everyone of\nthose that accidentally got merged into my\n\n261\n00:13:41.582 --> 00:13:45.034\ncalendar or is there like a no,\nabandon ship kind of button?\n\n262\n00:13:45.034 --> 00:13:47.829\n&gt;&gt; No, if,\nonce it's imported it's imported.\n\n263\n00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:51.970\nSo if this was let's say this was\nmy work calendar I would have to go\n\n264\n00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.000\ninto every single one of them.\n\n265\n00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.869\nAnd delete the series, that's why I use\nChris as an example, I can just go ahead,\n\n266\n00:13:58.869 --> 00:14:01.873\nthere's only two series in there,\nthe thing about,\n\n267\n00:14:01.873 --> 00:14:05.611\nyou've got people with tons of stuff,\nthat's a bit like [SOUND] and\n\n268\n00:14:05.611 --> 00:14:08.970\nI can see your face [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; I'm about to hyperventilate right now,\n\n269\n00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.646\njust thinking about it because this is\nsomething that I feel like it would be in\n\n270\n00:14:12.646 --> 00:14:13.760\nthe back of my mind.\n\n271\n00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.397\nI would have the little post-it note.\n\n272\n00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:19.760\nAnd I'm gonna have like one of those\nfoggy days and go [SOUND] there we go.\n\n273\n00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.386\nNo.\n\n274\n00:14:20.386 --> 00:14:24.189\n[LAUGH] And\nthen I'll never forget after that time.\n\n275\n00:14:24.189 --> 00:14:28.520\nBut the first time, all right,\nVonne's warned you appropriately.\n\n276\n00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.720\nBe very, very careful cuz it's gonna\nmerge into whatever calendar you select.\n\n277\n00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.140\n&gt;&gt; So keep that in mind.\n\n278\n00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.199\nI just feel this is something\nthat I would do and\n\n279\n00:14:37.199 --> 00:14:40.420\nafter the first I am like\nfool me once shame on me.\n\n280\n00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.340\n&gt;&gt; I know there is many of those\nlearnt the hard way, okay.\n\n281\n00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:48.060\nThat has been a lot of hours that\nI didn't need to do but, so yes,\n\n282\n00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.100\nmake that note for yourself, good point.\n\n283\n00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:55.250\nSo we've got our importing\nin our calendars.\n\n284\n00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.620\nNow the other one that we have here as\nother ways that we can get calendars of\n\n285\n00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:04.380\nother people that they're like sharing,\nif we want to say.\n\n286\n00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.280\nWe have from the internet, and\n\n287\n00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.980\nif I click on this notice that\nhas just asked me for a web link.\n\n288\n00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.040\nAnd this is where, let's come\njump over into google calendars.\n\n289\n00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.580\nAnd all of your different male\nclients usually have this option of\n\n290\n00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.830\npublishing your calendar.\n\n291\n00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:24.510\nWhen you publish, you're making it,\nyou can always think of that like\n\n292\n00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:28.259\nit's a public access,\nbecause you're creating a URL.\n\n293\n00:15:28.259 --> 00:15:31.726\nBut all people need to\ndo is have that link and\n\n294\n00:15:31.726 --> 00:15:37.650\nit shows your calendar in a web browser so\nyou can see that if I click on HTML.\n\n295\n00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:41.800\nNow, this is Google Calendar, you do have\nthat extra step of making sure that it\n\n296\n00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.760\nis a public calendar to set that.\n\n297\n00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:51.310\nAgain, not going into the intricacies of\nyour Google calendars, but if I take this\n\n298\n00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:56.640\nand then copy it, come back into Joey,\nand then paste that in here.\n\n299\n00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.955\nAnd then I can name this Chris.\n\n300\n00:15:57.955 --> 00:16:02.934\nNow this is talking about that\nbig asterisk that we talked\n\n301\n00:16:02.934 --> 00:16:06.158\nabout with the ICS file, yes, ICS.\n\n302\n00:16:06.158 --> 00:16:07.272\nDo it every time.\n\n303\n00:16:07.272 --> 00:16:09.560\nThis one will create a separate calendar.\n\n304\n00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.302\nIt doesn't merge in with\nwith your existing calendar.\n\n305\n00:16:13.302 --> 00:16:14.712\nSo if I go ahead and click, and\n\n306\n00:16:14.712 --> 00:16:17.772\nnotice it's talking about subscribe\nto this to keep up to date.\n\n307\n00:16:17.772 --> 00:16:22.651\nSo somebody keeps publishing out their\ncalendar, then you'll get those updates.\n\n308\n00:16:22.651 --> 00:16:27.656\nI'd supposed to bringing that ICS file,\nthat's like a hard import.\n\n309\n00:16:27.656 --> 00:16:29.768\nYou're not gonna get the continues,\n\n310\n00:16:29.768 --> 00:16:32.873\nlike changes that people\nare making to their calendar.\n\n311\n00:16:32.873 --> 00:16:36.883\nSo if I go ahead and click Save, notice\nit comes over here as my other calendar.\n\n312\n00:16:36.883 --> 00:16:40.538\nThere's not gonna be anything in here,\nbecause like I said,\n\n313\n00:16:40.538 --> 00:16:45.107\nthere's more things on the Google Calendar\nsite that Chris will need to do for\n\n314\n00:16:45.107 --> 00:16:46.603\nus to be able to see that.\n\n315\n00:16:46.603 --> 00:16:50.779\nBut it's really just an HTML URL\nlink that you go ahead and\n\n316\n00:16:50.779 --> 00:16:56.050\nadd into and be able to see\nsomebody else's published calendar.\n\n317\n00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.149\n&gt;&gt; It seems like that\nshould be the default for\n\n318\n00:16:58.149 --> 00:17:00.880\nimporting an ICS files\ninstead of merging it in?\n\n319\n00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.920\nLike, I wanna bring this\nin as a separate or\n\n320\n00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.440\nmaybe even like a toggle, because that\nwould be the expected behavior for\n\n321\n00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.640\nme, is like I'm bringing\nin someone else's calendar.\n\n322\n00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.697\nLet me tell you where to put it, so\n\n323\n00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:14.428\nit make sense when you\nbring it in to the web.\n\n324\n00:17:14.428 --> 00:17:18.121\nAnd maybe the ICS is really geared\ntoward like, updating your calendars,\n\n325\n00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:20.935\nmaybe had a couple calendars\nspread all over the place and\n\n326\n00:17:20.935 --> 00:17:22.759\nyour kind of merging them together.\n\n327\n00:17:22.759 --> 00:17:23.269\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n328\n00:17:23.269 --> 00:17:25.926\nI don't know that ICS would\ndefinitely get me on.\n\n329\n00:17:25.926 --> 00:17:27.405\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I kinda like the feel of,\n\n330\n00:17:27.405 --> 00:17:30.278\nlet me just bring this in from\nGoogle Calendar or whatever.\n\n331\n00:17:30.278 --> 00:17:33.371\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's almost like the drop down,\nlike the default obviously new or like,\n\n332\n00:17:33.371 --> 00:17:34.745\nnew calendar like you're saying.\n\n333\n00:17:34.745 --> 00:17:36.769\nAnd then you could choose\nthe merge options.\n\n334\n00:17:36.769 --> 00:17:37.820\nI don't like, you know what?\n\n335\n00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:38.732\nWe should write to Microsoft.\n\n336\n00:17:38.732 --> 00:17:42.331\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe should form a strongly worded letter.\n\n337\n00:17:42.331 --> 00:17:45.155\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A draft even.\n\n338\n00:17:45.155 --> 00:17:49.127\nA strongly worded letter, because I would\ndefinitely get burned by that merge.\n\n339\n00:17:49.127 --> 00:17:52.137\n&gt;&gt; We can make a calendar of how\nwe can meet to talk about it.\n\n340\n00:17:52.137 --> 00:17:55.735\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and I can live vicariously\nthrough your calendar appointment\n\n341\n00:17:55.735 --> 00:17:57.725\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just say, hey, when do we meet?\n\n342\n00:17:57.725 --> 00:17:59.659\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well yup, that looks good.\n\n343\n00:17:59.659 --> 00:18:01.587\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, awesome.\n\n344\n00:18:01.587 --> 00:18:03.470\nSo while we go over a few other things,\n\n345\n00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.887\ncuz we're talking about getting other\npeople's calendars that they've created.\n\n346\n00:18:07.887 --> 00:18:11.544\nBut what about if we wanted to publish or\nexport our calendars?\n\n347\n00:18:11.544 --> 00:18:13.565\nYou can do that, and\nthis is in the settings.\n\n348\n00:18:13.565 --> 00:18:15.258\nSo let's come back in here to Joey.\n\n349\n00:18:15.258 --> 00:18:20.400\nAnd if I go over to our settings on the\nright-hand side, you've seen me do this.\n\n350\n00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.710\nDown at the bottom, we're gonna go ahead\nand scroll on down to the calendar.\n\n351\n00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.657\nAnd then it brings up all\nthe calendar options.\n\n352\n00:18:25.657 --> 00:18:30.030\nSo I jump over here to the left, and\nthen we go over here to Shared calendars.\n\n353\n00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.205\nAnd we go to Calendar publishing.\n\n354\n00:18:32.205 --> 00:18:35.356\nAnd I've actually already\ndone this ahead of time.\n\n355\n00:18:35.356 --> 00:18:38.570\nSo all you would need to do\nis just select which calendar\n\n356\n00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:41.310\nthat you would like to go ahead and\npublish.\n\n357\n00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.860\nAnd we've got the calendar.\n\n358\n00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:47.214\nWhat level of details you want\npeople to be able to see?\n\n359\n00:18:47.214 --> 00:18:52.132\nWhen I create these calendar files,\nthen I could do like just availability or\n\n360\n00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:55.020\nfull details, I went with limited details.\n\n361\n00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.811\nAnd then you just click Save, and\nthen it creates these links right here.\n\n362\n00:18:58.811 --> 00:19:02.755\nSo if I click on this HTML one,\nI'm gonna go ahead and zoom out again,\n\n363\n00:19:02.755 --> 00:19:05.020\nthere's that published calendar.\n\n364\n00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:09.290\nAll I have to do is send people this\nparticular really long URL, and\n\n365\n00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:13.271\nthey would be able to view this\nexact same version right here.\n\n366\n00:19:13.271 --> 00:19:17.412\nThe same with that ICS file, if I click\nit, it's actually gonna click it and\n\n367\n00:19:17.412 --> 00:19:20.454\nthen download the,\nI've done this a couple of times and\n\n368\n00:19:20.454 --> 00:19:23.127\nnow you can see that I have\na calendar to ICS file.\n\n369\n00:19:23.127 --> 00:19:27.389\nAnd that would be something I'd\nlike attach, send to somebody, and\n\n370\n00:19:27.389 --> 00:19:30.210\nthey could import my exported calendar.\n\n371\n00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:34.180\nSo you have those\nparticular options there.\n\n372\n00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.390\nAnd these are the same over\nin the outlook.com version.\n\n373\n00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:41.970\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, a little while ago, just a\nlittle while ago in this episode actually,\n\n374\n00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:45.200\nyou talked about not being able\nto see those private meetings.\n\n375\n00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.380\nIf I turn this up to full availability,\nwould my private meetings or\n\n376\n00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:54.325\nmy private appointments become available\njust with the details blocked out,\n\n377\n00:19:54.325 --> 00:19:56.545\nor would there still be hidden from view?\n\n378\n00:19:56.545 --> 00:20:01.950\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure that the private\nones would not even show, okay?\n\n379\n00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.520\nThat's gonna be my default answer.\n\n380\n00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:09.040\nBecause that really is,\nit's kind of like that lock down of like,\n\n381\n00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.760\nIt's really only for me.\n\n382\n00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.440\nNow when we get in to sharing like\nactually giving permission for\n\n383\n00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.000\nother people to manage my calendar,\nthere is that level of whether or\n\n384\n00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.920\nnot I would want that particular person\nto be able to see private events.\n\n385\n00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.680\nBut even at that level, you can hide\nthat down and they won't see that.\n\n386\n00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.970\nSo private really does mean for you.\n\n387\n00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:33.397\nIt might show just a black, but\nthen nothing like, none of the details or\n\n388\n00:20:33.397 --> 00:20:36.859\neven it did say private,\nthere wouldn't be any details.\n\n389\n00:20:36.859 --> 00:20:40.159\nSo that's the whole idea behind using\na private appointment or meetings.\n\n390\n00:20:40.159 --> 00:20:44.316\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I was just wondered about that,\nbecause if you're trying to put all this\n\n391\n00:20:44.316 --> 00:20:48.473\ntiming together and figure out what days\nare best, even if they're private and\n\n392\n00:20:48.473 --> 00:20:52.963\nI don't want anybody to read and I still\nwant to say, hey, this time's blocked off.\n\n393\n00:20:52.963 --> 00:20:59.741\nThis is my business, but I just want\nyou to know that I'm unavailable.\n\n394\n00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:03.004\nI feel a little more comfortable with\nmaybe trying to use calendars instead of\n\n395\n00:21:03.004 --> 00:21:04.723\njust riding on the coat tails of others.\n\n396\n00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:08.567\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's honestly the level\nof how you wanna organize yourself, but\n\n397\n00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:11.946\nsince you can add so many other\ncalendars if you do have private events\n\n398\n00:21:11.946 --> 00:21:15.091\nthat you want to know that I don't\nwant anybody to see this ever,\n\n399\n00:21:15.091 --> 00:21:17.730\nlike make a completely separate calendar.\n\n400\n00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.162\nYeah, go ahead and\n\n401\n00:21:19.162 --> 00:21:23.825\non that other main calendar block\nthe time off so people know.\n\n402\n00:21:23.825 --> 00:21:25.805\nIt just depends on how\nprivate you wanna be.\n\n403\n00:21:25.805 --> 00:21:27.808\n[LAUGH] And just as, like you're saying,\n\n404\n00:21:27.808 --> 00:21:30.107\nmaking sure that nothing\nair gets out of there.\n\n405\n00:21:30.107 --> 00:21:34.707\nSo that's something that I personally\nwould suggest doing, just in case.\n\n406\n00:21:34.707 --> 00:21:37.693\nAll right, so\nlet's talk about the outlook.com, yes.\n\n407\n00:21:37.693 --> 00:21:41.334\nLet me jump over to Justin's computer,\nbecause I have there,\n\n408\n00:21:41.334 --> 00:21:44.023\nnow it said that we have the file and\ninternet.\n\n409\n00:21:44.023 --> 00:21:47.768\nNow the publishing options, I just wanna\ngo ahead quickly and show you that,\n\n410\n00:21:47.768 --> 00:21:50.374\nthe options here while\nthey're petty much the same.\n\n411\n00:21:50.374 --> 00:21:53.951\nThey do have a counter\npublishing the different levels,\n\n412\n00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:57.987\nlike the availability or\nsome of like the titles and locations.\n\n413\n00:21:57.987 --> 00:21:59.585\nSo yo have different lengths for\n\n414\n00:21:59.585 --> 00:22:02.780\nthe different levels of details\nthat you might wanna go ahead and\n\n415\n00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.708\nlet people know And you would just go\nahead and select which calendar you want.\n\n416\n00:22:06.708 --> 00:22:09.938\nAnd then I believe this\nbecomes a generate, and\n\n417\n00:22:09.938 --> 00:22:14.723\nthen it generates these HTML links or\nthe ICS links, if you wanna say.\n\n418\n00:22:14.723 --> 00:22:15.980\nSo you could go ahead and do that.\n\n419\n00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:20.500\nNow there is something that's\nkinda cute about outlook.com.\n\n420\n00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:25.360\nAnd I am gonna use the word cute there,\nbecause it's called schedules.\n\n421\n00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.100\nAnd this is very similar to,\n\n422\n00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:32.029\nI don't know if you ever look to any type\nof social media like a Facebook account,\n\n423\n00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:36.034\nor something that's like events\nlike I was thinking like a band.\n\n424\n00:22:36.034 --> 00:22:36.925\nAnd they go ahead and\n\n425\n00:22:36.925 --> 00:22:40.393\npublished all the different places that\nwe're gonna be playing around town.\n\n426\n00:22:40.393 --> 00:22:43.656\nAnd you go to the events and you're like,\nyeah, I'm coming so on and so forth.\n\n427\n00:22:43.656 --> 00:22:47.879\nAnd it share that out so\nI mean, maybe for example,\n\n428\n00:22:47.879 --> 00:22:52.117\nyou're looking for event for\nlike a bear hugging.\n\n429\n00:22:52.117 --> 00:22:53.685\nThat might be something\nyou're gonna follow.\n\n430\n00:22:53.685 --> 00:22:56.167\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'd tell you,\nI do get a good bear hug.\n\n431\n00:22:56.167 --> 00:22:57.492\nI mean, just hug them down.\n\n432\n00:22:57.492 --> 00:22:59.182\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe the Scottish games, or\n\n433\n00:22:59.182 --> 00:23:00.247\nhouse warming party.\n\n434\n00:23:00.247 --> 00:23:01.170\nWho knows, right?\n\n435\n00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:02.629\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n436\n00:23:02.629 --> 00:23:06.396\n&gt;&gt; I've seen those events I stay away\nfrom social media for the most part.\n\n437\n00:23:06.396 --> 00:23:07.752\nBut I do dabble here and there.\n\n438\n00:23:07.752 --> 00:23:10.933\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, or this could be even\njust like something that's on the website,\n\n439\n00:23:10.933 --> 00:23:11.740\nthat people.\n\n440\n00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:17.180\nYou can see it's almost like,\nI'm thinking about like a mom's crafting\n\n441\n00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:20.880\nlittle group that she goes ahead and\ncreates, and like, it's really easy.\n\n442\n00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.990\nAnd the nice thing is a lot\nof these different platforms,\n\n443\n00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.150\nit's pretty easy to create that.\n\n444\n00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:28.425\nGenerate that out, and share it with\npeople and update it and just like.\n\n445\n00:23:28.425 --> 00:23:31.560\nIt's kinda got like templated things,\nit's pretty cute, right?\n\n446\n00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.325\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna make a schedule for\nthe Scottish games.\n\n447\n00:23:34.325 --> 00:23:35.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n448\n00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:36.115\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's do it.\n\n449\n00:23:36.115 --> 00:23:36.992\nI'm ready to see it.\n\n450\n00:23:36.992 --> 00:23:39.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I even practiced my telephone pole\n\n451\n00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:43.275\nthrow, but maybe if I'm on schedule,\nI'll actually start practicing.\n\n452\n00:23:43.275 --> 00:23:46.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Awesome, so why don't\nI show you here on the schedules?\n\n453\n00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:50.940\nAnd this is only Outlook.com, but\nit's the cute aspect of all of this.\n\n454\n00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:53.890\nNow I've already created one\nat a hockey in Gainesville.\n\n455\n00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:55.790\nWhere to watch and talk about hockey.\n\n456\n00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:58.192\nAnd if I click on this one,\njust so you can see that.\n\n457\n00:23:58.192 --> 00:24:02.731\nSee, it gave me my own cute little header,\nand I made a pattern, and\n\n458\n00:24:02.731 --> 00:24:04.256\nI could add a picture.\n\n459\n00:24:04.256 --> 00:24:08.166\nAnd it's got a color scheme, so this is\njust something I create really quickly.\n\n460\n00:24:08.166 --> 00:24:11.760\nAnd then I could share this out, notice\nit just goes ahead and creates a link.\n\n461\n00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.050\nAnd then I could email this to you and\nshow you something about hockey.\n\n462\n00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:19.660\nSo it's the same idea that you could\ngo ahead and do the Scottish Games.\n\n463\n00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.565\nSo all I have to do is come\nover here to Schedules, and\n\n464\n00:24:22.565 --> 00:24:24.554\nthen we click the little plus sign.\n\n465\n00:24:24.554 --> 00:24:29.762\nAnd we can go ahead and Scottish Games,\nI don't know where that accent came from.\n\n466\n00:24:29.762 --> 00:24:31.165\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n467\n00:24:31.165 --> 00:24:31.899\n&gt;&gt; Me either, Vonne, but\n\n468\n00:24:31.899 --> 00:24:32.934\nwe'll pretend it was Scottish.\n\n469\n00:24:32.934 --> 00:24:37.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, So I'm gonna go\nwith a green, nice green thing.\n\n470\n00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do look nice and green.\n\n471\n00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so\nthen we could go ahead and add that.\n\n472\n00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:46.042\nThe first one we'll do is,\nlet's do Friday,\n\n473\n00:24:46.042 --> 00:24:50.624\nwe'll do 5 PM, telephone pole,\nis that what we're doing?\n\n474\n00:24:50.624 --> 00:24:52.284\n&gt;&gt; I think it has another official name,\nbut\n\n475\n00:24:52.284 --> 00:24:54.320\nwe're gonna say telephone pole throughout.\n\n476\n00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:59.519\n&gt;&gt; Okay, perfect, and we're going\nto do that at, let's go ahead and\n\n477\n00:24:59.519 --> 00:25:04.735\ntype in Lucy's, cuz that's the place\nwhere we go to watch hockey.\n\n478\n00:25:04.735 --> 00:25:09.028\nSo we'll go ahead and I've added this,\nand then we could say,\n\n479\n00:25:09.028 --> 00:25:12.592\nbring your sweat bands, or\nsomething like that, so\n\n480\n00:25:12.592 --> 00:25:17.610\nI can add little notes, if I click Done,\nand then I've added that in.\n\n481\n00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:22.650\nWe could add a little pattern, we can\nhave, okay, there's some sports, or that's\n\n482\n00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:27.760\nperfect, put a bird on it, and then we've\ngot some other things that we can add.\n\n483\n00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.420\nThen, like I said, you go ahead and\nshare this out, bring out a link,\n\n484\n00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:36.200\nand then your friends can go ahead and see\nall the different Scottish Games events\n\n485\n00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.680\nthat we're gonna be having in so\npretty cute, right?\n\n486\n00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.139\n&gt;&gt; That is pretty interesting,\nand this is outlook.com only,\n\n487\n00:25:43.139 --> 00:25:46.938\nand not Outlook on the web,\nlike the corporate or entity based one?\n\n488\n00:25:46.938 --> 00:25:48.300\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Am I correct on that?\n\n489\n00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.147\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthe schedules is definitely not part of,\n\n490\n00:25:51.147 --> 00:25:54.075\nactually I have [INAUDIBLE] so\nthere's no schedules.\n\n491\n00:25:54.075 --> 00:25:58.977\nSo it's not as cute as the outlook.com,\nso I like those little things, and\n\n492\n00:25:58.977 --> 00:26:02.260\nso if you have it, I think that's good.\n\n493\n00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.634\nNow, we did talk about like the different\nlevels we're gonna add an account.\n\n494\n00:26:05.634 --> 00:26:09.780\nAnd then we're gonna talk about sharing,\nbut you're giving me the little signal.\n\n495\n00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:14.500\nYou've sent me a memo on my calendar\nthat says, hey, you need to go ahead and\n\n496\n00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.820\nwrap this up.\n\n497\n00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.200\nSo I think I'm gonna go ahead and keep\nthe part two, we're gonna come back for\n\n498\n00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:19.722\na part two.\n\n499\n00:26:19.722 --> 00:26:23.476\nAnd talk about actually delegating\npermissions to other people to control my\n\n500\n00:26:23.476 --> 00:26:24.060\ncalendar.\n\n501\n00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:28.817\nAnd that way, I can go ahead and give you\na nice demonstration between Lance and\n\n502\n00:26:28.817 --> 00:26:32.388\nJT, I believe,\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, we definitely always want\n\n503\n00:26:32.388 --> 00:26:36.063\nto make sure we have an appropriate\namount of time to fully explore a topic.\n\n504\n00:26:36.063 --> 00:26:37.997\nBecause we've seen that, technically,\n\n505\n00:26:37.997 --> 00:26:40.100\nwe're sharing to some\nlevel in this episode.\n\n506\n00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:45.610\nHere's my public exposed one, I'm bringing\nit in, or I'm merging an ICS file.\n\n507\n00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:50.691\nThose are all nice, but for someone who\nneeds someone to control their calendar,\n\n508\n00:26:50.691 --> 00:26:54.900\nmaybe like moi, then I'm definitely\nlooking forward to part two.\n\n509\n00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.247\nAnd hopefully you are as well, but\nfor now, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n510\n00:26:58.247 --> 00:26:59.125\nwrap this one up.\n\n511\n00:26:59.125 --> 00:27:02.620\nSo signing off for OfficePro.TV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n512\n00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.181\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

officeprotv.\n\n3\n00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.450\nI'm your host Justine Denison and\n\n4\n00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.920\ntoday's episode we're actually coming back\nwith the part two on sharing calendars.\n\n5\n00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.660\nAnd well, I think this time is\ngonna be near and dear to my heart,\n\n6\n00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.670\nbecause if we're going to actually\nshare calendars and relinquish control\n\n7\n00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.660\nas I think we are, I can now off-put\ncreating calendars to someone else for me.\n\n8\n00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.540\nAnd then it's like my\nlife is on autopilot.\n\n9\n00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.410\nAnd luckily, we have the very\nindividual that's gonna tell us,\n\n10\n00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.950\nhow to do those exact things,\nMiss Vonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:42.945\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n\n12\n00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:44.200\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n13\n00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.804\nIt does sound like you need somebody\nto manage your calendar [LAUGH].\n\n14\n00:00:46.804 --> 00:00:50.766\n&gt;&gt; I was really excited, I was like, yeah,\nsomebody's gonna take over my calendar and\n\n15\n00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:54.248\nactually, put all the dates and\nappointments and things that I need in it.\n\n16\n00:00:54.248 --> 00:00:57.832\nAnd then I'm just gonna get emails,\nman, I got somewhere to be.\n\n17\n00:00:57.832 --> 00:01:01.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you just look at your\ncalendar like, look, I have a meeting.\n\n18\n00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.265\nI'm going to this conference,\nit's perfect, yes.\n\n19\n00:01:03.265 --> 00:01:07.109\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if I trust that wholly\nthough, because people will be like,\n\n20\n00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:09.981\nyeah you have a dinner date and\nI would show up and then-\n\n21\n00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:11.046\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:01:11.046 --> 00:01:13.069\n&gt;&gt; I think people would mess with me, so\n\n23\n00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:16.690\nI'll wait and reserve judgement\nuntil the end of this episode.\n\n24\n00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.323\n&gt;&gt; You know, this is actually a really\ngood point that you just made, if you're\n\n25\n00:01:21.323 --> 00:01:26.102\ngoing to be sharing calendars in the sense\nof like relinquishing control of your\n\n26\n00:01:26.102 --> 00:01:31.125\ncalendar to somebody else, you might need\nto trust that person now wouldn't you?\n\n27\n00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:34.903\nYou know, because that would be bad,\nlike you're saying, show up somewhere and\n\n28\n00:01:34.903 --> 00:01:38.626\nthey're like hey, well my assistant put\nthis on my calendar and I just blindly go\n\n29\n00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:42.170\nwherever my calendar tells me and\nthen it's like ooh That's not very good.\n\n30\n00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.770\n&gt;&gt; I feel like it would be those times\nwhere my GPS tells me to turn left and\n\n31\n00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.550\nthere's no possible way I cold turn left.\n\n32\n00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.673\nSo there's an inherent I trust you, but\nI'm gonna double check you just in case.\n\n33\n00:01:52.673 --> 00:01:53.956\nAnd then now we're back\nto actually me having\n\n34\n00:01:53.956 --> 00:01:55.867\nto maintain part of the calendar and\nI don't know, I don't know.\n\n35\n00:01:55.867 --> 00:01:58.542\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we'll see what you got Bob,\n\n36\n00:01:58.542 --> 00:02:00.695\nyou might convince me by\nthe end of this episode.\n\n37\n00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:03.769\n&gt;&gt; Well, the other thing is,\nit's still your calendar, so\n\n38\n00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:06.800\nyou could still see it or\ndelete things or change things.\n\n39\n00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.271\nSo it's not like you don't have any say\nover what you're doing, it's just that\n\n40\n00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:15.675\nyou're gonna give a lot of the heavy\nlifting if you wanna say, to someone else,\n\n41\n00:02:15.675 --> 00:02:20.140\nto be able to create everything and\nanswer for you on media requests.\n\n42\n00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.200\nAnd knows this like that so, yeah,\n\n43\n00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.870\nmake sure you do trust\nthe person that is doing this.\n\n44\n00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.050\nAnd then you know talking about like\nthe very much a role would be assistant to\n\n45\n00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.480\nlike the CEO or just somebody or\ndirector, and that's pretty much my job.\n\n46\n00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.964\nI'm an administrative\nassistant that's doing this.\n\n47\n00:02:35.964 --> 00:02:39.101\nSo this is a lot of times where\nyou see this type of role,\n\n48\n00:02:39.101 --> 00:02:43.680\nof controlling somebody else's\nappointment because that's what they do.\n\n49\n00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.540\nSo now, of course,\n\n50\n00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.675\nsay that particular administrative\nassistant moves on, to a new position.\n\n51\n00:02:49.675 --> 00:02:51.895\nWell, you've gotta make sure\nthat you tell that hey,\n\n52\n00:02:51.895 --> 00:02:54.566\nthis person doesn't have permission\ninto my calendar anymore.\n\n53\n00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:59.504\nAnd so you can be able to take away that\nright if you wanna say, that permission on\n\n54\n00:02:59.504 --> 00:03:04.850\nyour level as the owner of the calendar,\nso it is all very controllable.\n\n55\n00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.100\nAnd this is something that you can do\non the local installation view and\n\n56\n00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.910\nof course now, that since we're\ndoing Outlook on the web for\n\n57\n00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.970\nthis series you can do\nit right here as well.\n\n58\n00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.960\nSo now, this is different.\n\n59\n00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.080\nI'm just gonna go ahead and give a nice\nlittle disclaimer, sharing mailboxes and\n\n60\n00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.160\nhaving that type of control,\nthat's a different level, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.570\nSo we're just talking about calendar only,\nnot controlling a mailbox.\n\n62\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.610\nThat's a separate one and\nwe'll address that somewhere else.\n\n63\n00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.930\nSo just keep that in mind,\ncuz everybody starts thinking, well,\n\n64\n00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.760\nif it's my administrative assistant she\ndoes everything, answers my emails,\n\n65\n00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.240\nwrites emails on my behalf,\nall those different levels.\n\n66\n00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.913\nSo separate entity altogether.\n\n67\n00:03:43.913 --> 00:03:46.870\nSo why don't we jump into Joey's calendar.\n\n68\n00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.770\nNow, I have a lot of this already set up,\nbecause it's not like,\n\n69\n00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.580\nit's not hard to do, and\nI'll show you where it's at.\n\n70\n00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.700\nI just went ahead and prepopulated.\n\n71\n00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.989\nBecause since I am working in a cloud\nenvironment, whether it's local or not,\n\n72\n00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.704\nsometimes some of these sharing\npermissions Just like anything with\n\n73\n00:04:03.704 --> 00:04:06.732\nthe cloud, you might give it\na little while, you know.\n\n74\n00:04:06.732 --> 00:04:10.783\nOkay, set it and forget it, come back the\nnext day and then if it's still broken,\n\n75\n00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:13.090\nthen go ahead and\ncontact the administrator.\n\n76\n00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.880\nSo sometimes cloud based systems can\nbe a little wonky sometimes like that.\n\n77\n00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.740\n&gt;&gt; Finicky.\n\n78\n00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.640\nIt's kind of, we tend to like\nthis instant gratification.\n\n79\n00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.470\nI know I'm bad about share, share, share.\n\n80\n00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.976\nPeople are like I still can't see it.\n\n81\n00:04:26.976 --> 00:04:29.600\nAnd I just keep clicking the button,\nbut sometimes you have to wait for\n\n82\n00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.680\nthese things to propagate.\n\n83\n00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.043\nEspecially if these are internal\norganizational type things, so\n\n84\n00:04:34.043 --> 00:04:36.332\nthey have to propagate throughout systems.\n\n85\n00:04:36.332 --> 00:04:41.346\nSo be patient, cuz sometimes you've just\ngotta be patient and you can't make things\n\n86\n00:04:41.346 --> 00:04:46.235\ngo faster by getting double-clicking that\nbutton doesn't make it twice as fast.\n\n87\n00:04:46.235 --> 00:04:48.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, the wash pot never\nboils or something like that.\n\n88\n00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.100\nAm I using that one right?\n\n89\n00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.807\n&gt;&gt; I'm not entirely sure.\n\n90\n00:04:51.807 --> 00:04:52.667\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we'll go with it.\n\n91\n00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.407\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I always get those slogans wrong,\n\n92\n00:04:54.407 --> 00:04:55.101\nor sayings wrong.\n\n93\n00:04:55.101 --> 00:04:57.687\n&gt;&gt; A watched pot never boils?\n\n94\n00:04:57.687 --> 00:04:58.540\nRight?\n\n95\n00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.087\nI watched,\nI thought you said you have to wash that.\n\n96\n00:05:01.087 --> 00:05:01.976\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was like,\n\n97\n00:05:01.976 --> 00:05:04.892\nI don't see how that has\nanything to do with boiling.\n\n98\n00:05:04.892 --> 00:05:06.416\n&gt;&gt; Well, [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Like,\n\n99\n00:05:06.416 --> 00:05:08.780\nthis thing is not boiling at all for me.\n\n100\n00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.054\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's another level,\n\n101\n00:05:10.054 --> 00:05:12.740\nsometimes not being able to understand\nwhat's coming out of my mouth, so\n\n102\n00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.013\nthere's a couple levels of that.\n\n103\n00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:17.708\n&gt;&gt; Yes, a watched pot never boils,\nwhich is not true, but\n\n104\n00:05:17.708 --> 00:05:19.762\nit is a saying people that say.\n\n105\n00:05:19.762 --> 00:05:22.194\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, so\nwhy don't we go ahead and\n\n106\n00:05:22.194 --> 00:05:24.800\njump back down into Justin's computer.\n\n107\n00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.870\nBecause Justin has already given\npermission to Joey to go ahead and\n\n108\n00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.870\nmanage his calendar, so\nagain I am JT, right.\n\n109\n00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.670\nJustin hey, Justin you're gonna\nhave Joey manage your calendar.\n\n110\n00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.071\n&gt;&gt; Sounds fantastic.\n\n111\n00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:42.343\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if I can do the,\n\n112\n00:05:42.343 --> 00:05:44.680\npull the boy band calendar off.\n\n113\n00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.860\nBut we'll give it a go.\n\n114\n00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.640\n&gt;&gt; I think you'd be fantastic.\n\n115\n00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.932\nSo we have over here the calendar and\n\n116\n00:05:49.932 --> 00:05:53.870\nin Justin setting,\nyou have a share, right here.\n\n117\n00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.531\nSo Justin wants to share his calendar out\nand it's already in here, so you can see,\n\n118\n00:05:57.531 --> 00:06:00.878\nand there's a couple little things\nbehind my head that you can see, right,\n\n119\n00:06:00.878 --> 00:06:04.541\nlike talk about the private events that we\nwere talking about in the other episode,\n\n120\n00:06:04.541 --> 00:06:05.153\nright here.\n\n121\n00:06:05.153 --> 00:06:10.650\nSo, this is saying that Joey has\nthe right to Justin's calendar.\n\n122\n00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.340\nBut I wanted to go ahead and\nput in Lance for\n\n123\n00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.500\nright now,\njust to show you some of the settings.\n\n124\n00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.330\nSo if I'm ready to share this calendar,\nnotice that I can give different\n\n125\n00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.020\nlevels of permission to Lance\nthat they can just view.\n\n126\n00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.796\nNow, that's just like remember sharing,\njust viewing,\n\n127\n00:06:28.796 --> 00:06:31.746\nthat's almost just like\nopening a calendar.\n\n128\n00:06:31.746 --> 00:06:33.810\nAnd this one, it's like okay, can edit.\n\n129\n00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.932\nThat's probably something you'd\nwant to do, but then delegate.\n\n130\n00:06:36.932 --> 00:06:38.420\nIt's kinda two different levels.\n\n131\n00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.070\nWhen you go to delegate\nthat actually says, and\n\n132\n00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.520\nit's right here, delegates can view,\ncreate and modify.\n\n133\n00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.610\nBut more than that is that\nthey can go ahead and\n\n134\n00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.480\nrespond to meeting\nrequests on your behalf.\n\n135\n00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.160\nSo they can get that meeting request,\ngo ahead, and then answer for\n\n136\n00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.080\nyou, and go with that.\n\n137\n00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.480\nSo that's the level that\nyou might want to set for\n\n138\n00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.610\nsomebody to be able to,\nwell, meeting request.\n\n139\n00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.405\nAnd notice right here it says send\ninvitations and responses to.\n\n140\n00:07:08.405 --> 00:07:13.237\nAnd if I drop this guy down, there's\nsome other options here where if I do\n\n141\n00:07:13.237 --> 00:07:17.790\ndelegate only, that means me like\nthis would be Justin right now.\n\n142\n00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.952\nJustin would not even ever see the meeting\nrequests from somebody else, All right.\n\n143\n00:07:22.952 --> 00:07:27.716\nNow, if I chose it to both delegate and\nme, this is where Justin and\n\n144\n00:07:27.716 --> 00:07:31.304\nJoey, that would be the delegate,\nwould get it.\n\n145\n00:07:31.304 --> 00:07:34.389\nAnd then delegate only, send me\nnotifications, that is just kind of like\n\n146\n00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:37.980\nhey, just giving you a little kind of\nheads up that this is what is going on.\n\n147\n00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:43.254\nSo now, this is one of those things that I\nthink you would both need to talk about,\n\n148\n00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:48.375\nin a sense, if you have an assistant and\na director to communicate what level,\n\n149\n00:07:48.375 --> 00:07:53.341\nbecause if Justin is seeing all of these,\nand then responds, well, then,\n\n150\n00:07:53.341 --> 00:07:54.540\nwhat about Joey?\n\n151\n00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.480\nSo I think it's like you're going to\nbe stepping over each other's toes.\n\n152\n00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.680\nSo that's that level of trust and\nhey, just do it, go ahead.\n\n153\n00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:09.500\nSo as you, as the director, manager,\nCEO, whatever one position, you might\n\n154\n00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.870\nwant it to say, just give it all to the\ndelegate and you can control everything.\n\n155\n00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:18.250\nSo that is the setting that I have for\nJoey's right here,\n\n156\n00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.510\nthat Justin said,\nyou take care of it, right.\n\n157\n00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.290\nSo I just wanted to go with that and\n\n158\n00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.560\nI don't really wanna share\nmy calendar with Lance.\n\n159\n00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.460\nSo right over here, little trash can,\njust gonna go ahead and\n\n160\n00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.282\nclick that out to just\nonly have Joey control it.\n\n161\n00:08:32.282 --> 00:08:34.310\nCuz we think about it, you have two\npeople controlling your calendar,\n\n162\n00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:36.300\nthat might get, a little crazy too.\n\n163\n00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:40.270\nBut, hey, I'm sure there's always a backup\nperson that you might want to do.\n\n164\n00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:44.170\nWhen Joey's out of the office, you\nmight wanna have Lance jump into there.\n\n165\n00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:47.750\nSo again,\nup to your workflow in your organization.\n\n166\n00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.980\nSo on that level Justin has\nshared out the calendar to Joey.\n\n167\n00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.560\nSo let's flip back over to Joey.\n\n168\n00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.730\nI'm gonna come over to the email for\na second to show you that right here,\n\n169\n00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.880\nthere was an email from\nJustin Timberlake that said that\n\n170\n00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.811\nyou were invited to have\naccess to this calendar.\n\n171\n00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:07.448\nCan we open it up, so we can see it\na little bit better and I will say that,\n\n172\n00:09:07.448 --> 00:09:10.010\nright here it says you'll\nreceive invitations.\n\n173\n00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:14.200\nCopies will be sent to Justin Timberlake\nthat was before I changed the level,\n\n174\n00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.800\ncuz I did have like both, and\njust to kinda test it out.\n\n175\n00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.950\nBut then I went back as Justin and\nchanged it to delegate only, okay?\n\n176\n00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:27.830\nSo just knowing that Justin does\nhave control at all times of\n\n177\n00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.910\nwhat permission levels\nthese people have on there.\n\n178\n00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:36.470\nSo just notice that if I had gotten\na first email which is say only to me.\n\n179\n00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.774\nCuz I'm the delegate now, cuz I'm Joey,\ngotta make sure where I'm at.\n\n180\n00:09:39.774 --> 00:09:43.476\n[LAUGH] We'll close on that and you can\nsee you just click on the button and\n\n181\n00:09:43.476 --> 00:09:45.090\nyou would have accessed to it.\n\n182\n00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.800\nSo if I come over here to the calendar,\nI am in,\n\n183\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.220\nlet's scroll down over here on the left\nto open up Justin's calendar right there.\n\n184\n00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.873\nI had it in like overlay view,\n\n185\n00:09:55.873 --> 00:09:59.721\nI'm gonna turn Joey's calender off\njust to make it a little easier.\n\n186\n00:09:59.721 --> 00:10:03.560\nLet's pretend I need to make\nan appointment for Justin here, so\n\n187\n00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.546\nI'm making an appointment there,\nI open it up and\n\n188\n00:10:06.546 --> 00:10:11.510\nnotice that I have multiple calendars that\nI could go ahead and create an event.\n\n189\n00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.310\nThat is something that if you're managing\nmultiple people like yourself and\n\n190\n00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:16.300\nsomebody else,\n\n191\n00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.730\nmake sure you check down on that save to\ncalendar which one you're adding it to.\n\n192\n00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.750\nAre you adding it to your bosses\ncalendar or to your calendar?\n\n193\n00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:30.000\nSo double check all of that and\nlet's go ahead and jump over to Lance.\n\n194\n00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.380\nI might of, yeah I didn't realize I\ndidn't have his virtual machine up and\n\n195\n00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.700\nready for us.\n\n196\n00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.435\nThat's so cute, sorry.\n\n197\n00:10:37.435 --> 00:10:40.630\n[LAUGH] Easily distracted\nby cute furry foxes.\n\n198\n00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:44.250\n&gt;&gt; Foxes, I think those are fox, I think\nthose are desert foxes or something.\n\n199\n00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:44.907\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n200\n00:10:44.907 --> 00:10:49.110\n&gt;&gt; I'm not a wildlife biologist, so\nwe're just gonna go with they're foxes.\n\n201\n00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what does the fox say?\n\n202\n00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.468\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n203\n00:10:51.468 --> 00:10:52.975\nDoop Doop Doop Do Doop Do Doop.\n\n204\n00:10:52.975 --> 00:10:53.727\nIs that what it says.\n\n205\n00:10:53.727 --> 00:10:54.930\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what it says.\n\n206\n00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.487\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure that's\nwhat the song says.\n\n207\n00:10:56.487 --> 00:10:58.219\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n[LAUGH] So we'll go ahead and\n\n208\n00:10:58.219 --> 00:11:02.115\nlog into Lance's computer, and look at\nthere, there's the email right there.\n\n209\n00:11:02.115 --> 00:11:05.661\nI'm gonna go ahead and refresh this\njust to make sure that we're all kind of\n\n210\n00:11:05.661 --> 00:11:08.570\nconnected and everything's working.\n\n211\n00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:15.744\nFor Lance because I like to as Lance\nsend a meeting request to Joe,\n\n212\n00:11:15.744 --> 00:11:22.030\nno, JT, okay,\nLance is sending it to Justin.\n\n213\n00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:27.437\nBut then Joey's going to respond man\nI am really working my brain today.\n\n214\n00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:31.173\nAnd just to let you know these other\nemails in here, remember the Outlook.com\n\n215\n00:11:31.173 --> 00:11:34.830\nthat we had talked about in Part I\nabout the hawk in Gainesville.\n\n216\n00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.336\nI went ahead and share that out,\nso that you can see that this is\n\n217\n00:11:38.336 --> 00:11:43.067\nwhat somebody on the receiving end would\nsee on a shared schedule on outlook.com.\n\n218\n00:11:43.067 --> 00:11:46.430\nAll right, so let's go ahead and,\nwhoops, we're not making a new email.\n\n219\n00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:47.850\nThat's the wrong button there too, Von.\n\n220\n00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.700\nSo why don't you go ahead and close that.\n\n221\n00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.210\nJump on over to our calendar and\nfrom here.\n\n222\n00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.950\nI think I probably could have done that\nfrom the drop down, but that's okay.\n\n223\n00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:01.014\nWe're gonna do a new calendar event and\n\n224\n00:12:01.014 --> 00:12:05.086\nwe will go for the Thursday right here.\n\n225\n00:12:05.086 --> 00:12:09.849\nAnd we'll say Lance for\nJT to try to keep my brain in order,\n\n226\n00:12:09.849 --> 00:12:15.101\nwe're not gonna do much more pass\nthat with all the details, but\n\n227\n00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:21.251\nI will go ahead and ask that Justine is\ngoing to be required to this meeting.\n\n228\n00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:25.020\nAnd everything like that we're\ngonna go head and keep the same.\n\n229\n00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.922\nSo we're gonna go head and send this off.\n\n230\n00:12:26.922 --> 00:12:31.566\nRemember Lance is asking Justin, for\n\n231\n00:12:31.566 --> 00:12:36.798\na meeting, but Joey is Justin's keeper.\n\n232\n00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:41.334\n[LAUGH] So we're going to go ahead and\ncome over here, and\n\n233\n00:12:41.334 --> 00:12:45.675\nwe're going to make sure that\nthe mail got sent out and\n\n234\n00:12:45.675 --> 00:12:48.590\nthere should be a mail right there.\n\n235\n00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.630\nYou know what, let's go ahead and\ndo a good old refresh.\n\n236\n00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.000\nThat's always a good thing to do.\n\n237\n00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Vonne,\nsometimes you just have to do a refresh.\n\n238\n00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.300\nIt's kind of like the old adage,\nturn it off and turn it back on again.\n\n239\n00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.762\nSometimes that's all it takes to get\nthings to actually come through.\n\n240\n00:13:00.762 --> 00:13:02.780\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, I love a refresh, so\n\n241\n00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.620\nwhat, it actually already came in\nwhen I did that, so we're good there.\n\n242\n00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.490\nSo you can see right here that, remember\nI'm Joey I am managing Justin's calendar.\n\n243\n00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.585\nSo you can see that I've got the Lance for\nJT,\n\n244\n00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:16.859\nthe one that Lance created,\nwhich is perfect.\n\n245\n00:13:16.859 --> 00:13:19.893\nOne other point that I do want to make,\nremember that delegation,\n\n246\n00:13:19.893 --> 00:13:21.740\nwith the different levels?\n\n247\n00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:26.430\nIf I jump over here to Justin,\n&gt;&gt; Justin does not have an email in here.\n\n248\n00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.580\nThere's nothing that says in\nthe meeting request to him directly,\n\n249\n00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:36.540\nbecause Justin told the settings to say,\nhey, don't go ahead and email me.\n\n250\n00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.280\nThrow it over to the person managing it.\n\n251\n00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:43.497\nThat's the one who I've delegated to\ngo ahead and talk on my behalf, okay.\n\n252\n00:13:43.497 --> 00:13:46.807\nNow, as the person managing\nsomebody else's calendar,\n\n253\n00:13:46.807 --> 00:13:49.600\nbe careful because this is again,\nwhere am I?\n\n254\n00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.290\nWho am I?\n\n255\n00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:51.350\nWhat am I doing?\n\n256\n00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:56.420\nThis is for Lance or JT Now somebody\nprobably wouldn't title it that way.\n\n257\n00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.450\nYou have to look at who's required.\n\n258\n00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.580\nIs this for me, as me Joey?\n\n259\n00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:05.367\nOr is this for me for\nmanaging Justin, okay?\n\n260\n00:14:05.367 --> 00:14:09.215\nThe only people that are required\nhere are Lance and Justin, so\n\n261\n00:14:09.215 --> 00:14:13.206\nthis is where you have to keep\nyour brain straight and say, okay,\n\n262\n00:14:13.206 --> 00:14:16.131\nlet me go ahead and\naccept on Justin's behalf.\n\n263\n00:14:16.131 --> 00:14:17.752\nNow, you can always go ahead and\n\n264\n00:14:17.752 --> 00:14:21.895\ndo the same things with meetings with the\nproposed new time and all that and you, as\n\n265\n00:14:21.895 --> 00:14:26.620\nthe manager of somebody else's calendar,\nwould be the one talking back and forth.\n\n266\n00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.710\nJustin doesn't see any\nof that interaction.\n\n267\n00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:33.027\nI'm just gonna go ahead and keep it\neasy and click accept, and then yes,\n\n268\n00:14:33.027 --> 00:14:34.444\nI will just send the response.\n\n269\n00:14:34.444 --> 00:14:39.436\nNow, and then it goes on there and\nso, if I as Joy come over here,\n\n270\n00:14:39.436 --> 00:14:44.891\ntwo Justin's counter there it is,\nLance 4 JT, has been added as JT,\n\n271\n00:14:44.891 --> 00:14:49.810\nall right, if I come over here,\nand then, yep, it's on his.\n\n272\n00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:54.049\nSo that's where Justin's like, hey, I got\nan appointment, right, and I'm good to go.\n\n273\n00:14:54.049 --> 00:14:57.435\nSo that's what I wanted to demonstrate\nto you guys, of all of that\n\n274\n00:14:57.435 --> 00:15:00.884\nkind of interaction, although\nthere's a lot of clicking back and\n\n275\n00:15:00.884 --> 00:15:05.120\nforth, but how other people can\nstart managing your accounts.\n\n276\n00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.580\nLike I said, Justin can always go back\nover and remove those permissions.\n\n277\n00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.290\nWe could come over here and\nit's behind my head, but\n\n278\n00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.420\nyou can see that Joey he could go ahead,\nJT could go ahead and\n\n279\n00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.270\nremove that access and\nthen you wouldn't have that there.\n\n280\n00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:24.645\nWhile I'm over here on this computer,\nJustin, I also have the outlook.com.\n\n281\n00:15:24.645 --> 00:15:27.529\nSo you can share in outlook.com, so\n\n282\n00:15:27.529 --> 00:15:31.578\nyou could notice that I have the sharing\npermissions just the same way.\n\n283\n00:15:31.578 --> 00:15:34.030\nAnd I could go ahead and\nsend it to somebody, actually,\n\n284\n00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.076\nI've already sent it to Lance.\n\n285\n00:15:36.076 --> 00:15:42.560\nIs that he can edit, so if I jump over\nto Lance's computer, and see that email\n\n286\n00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:48.388\nthat is where lets go and make sure I'm\nback in Lance's inbox, there we go.\n\n287\n00:15:48.388 --> 00:15:53.620\nAnd there, Vonne Smith has invited\nyou to share her calendar with you,\n\n288\n00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.050\ndo you want to accept this?\n\n289\n00:15:56.050 --> 00:16:01.064\nAnd then it will go ahead and add and\nyou can edit on that person we have.\n\n290\n00:16:01.064 --> 00:16:05.352\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, it seems that outlook.com\nhas all the kind of bodies that\n\n291\n00:16:05.352 --> 00:16:07.694\nwe've that's for as I look on the lib.\n\n292\n00:16:07.694 --> 00:16:11.720\n&gt;&gt; For the most part, I mean, the delegate\nwhere you're going to like it only has\n\n293\n00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:17.290\ncan view and can edit, so it doesn't go\nto that next level, but yes, just like\n\n294\n00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:20.430\nwe did with Joey and Justin, like,\nactually let me show you really quick.\n\n295\n00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:24.128\nSo here at Lance,\nyou've got the invitation, but\n\n296\n00:16:24.128 --> 00:16:29.202\nthen down on the calendar, if I go\nahead and make a new calendar event,\n\n297\n00:16:29.202 --> 00:16:34.362\nnotice that down here right there,\nyou can see save to which calendar,\n\n298\n00:16:34.362 --> 00:16:39.608\nsince Vonne, talking about myself in\nthe third person is really weird,\n\n299\n00:16:39.608 --> 00:16:44.768\nthat Vonne gave access to Lance to edit,\nthen Lance can go ahead and make\n\n300\n00:16:44.768 --> 00:16:50.724\nan event from here and then Vonne will see\nit on her calendar over at outlook.com.\n\n301\n00:16:50.724 --> 00:16:54.730\nWe got so people into this little episode,\nwe've been going back and forth.\n\n302\n00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:59.160\nThere's a lot of sharing, and\nwho am I, and lots of people.\n\n303\n00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.283\nHopefully, you got the whole gist of it\nand being able to do that control, and\n\n304\n00:17:03.283 --> 00:17:06.463\nyes outlook.com does have a lot\nof the same capabilities.\n\n305\n00:17:06.463 --> 00:17:08.963\nSo that's nice if you have\nyour free version and\n\n306\n00:17:08.963 --> 00:17:12.838\nyour paid version to be able to do things,\nbut sometimes you do have to kind\n\n307\n00:17:12.838 --> 00:17:15.354\nof determine,\nwhat level of service do I need?\n\n308\n00:17:15.354 --> 00:17:19.010\nAnd if outlook.com does the trick,\nthen great.\n\n309\n00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.755\nSometimes it' like, well I have to have a\nlocal insulation of Outlook because I need\n\n310\n00:17:22.755 --> 00:17:24.145\nall of the bells and whistles.\n\n311\n00:17:24.145 --> 00:17:28.299\nSo you do need to kinda,\nkinda, kinda figure that out.\n\n312\n00:17:28.299 --> 00:17:30.525\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I thought we were bursting, kinda,\n\n313\n00:17:30.525 --> 00:17:31.355\nkinda, kinda.\n\n314\n00:17:31.355 --> 00:17:32.735\nNo, that's a different song.\n\n315\n00:17:32.735 --> 00:17:35.691\n&gt;&gt; My mind went there directly.\n\n316\n00:17:35.691 --> 00:17:38.538\nI'm was able to start dancing and\neverything.\n\n317\n00:17:38.538 --> 00:17:41.517\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm not gonna dance,\nbut we're gonna-\n\n318\n00:17:41.517 --> 00:17:42.086\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n319\n00:17:42.086 --> 00:17:43.640\n&gt;&gt; Let's kinda tidy this one up.\n\n320\n00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.230\nNow, Vonne, you've definitely shown\nus that an outlook on the web\n\n321\n00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:50.910\nprovides a great deal of\ncapabilities as far as essentially\n\n322\n00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.065\nrelinquishing all control\nof your calendar.\n\n323\n00:17:53.065 --> 00:17:55.835\nAnd for the most part just completely\ndelegating that to someone else,\n\n324\n00:17:55.835 --> 00:17:58.005\nincluding the invite emails and such.\n\n325\n00:17:58.005 --> 00:18:00.355\nAnd we can get a lot of\nthat on outlook.com,\n\n326\n00:18:00.355 --> 00:18:04.685\nwe don't quite get the email interception\nand some of those nicer features.\n\n327\n00:18:04.685 --> 00:18:07.445\nBut a lot of the core\nfunctionality is there.\n\n328\n00:18:07.445 --> 00:18:11.044\nI'm almost sold, but I don't know\nif I quite have the trust necessary\n\n329\n00:18:11.044 --> 00:18:15.443\nto completely delegate my calendar, though\nit is bare, for anyone else to fulfill.\n\n330\n00:18:15.443 --> 00:18:18.210\nBut that's gonna go ahead and\nwrap this episode up.\n\n331\n00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:21.220\nBut we do have more Outlook on\nthe web content coming your way, so\n\n332\n00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.830\ndefinitely stay tuned.\n\n333\n00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:26.730\nBut for now, signing off for OFFICEPRO.TV\nI've been you host Justin Anderson\n\n334\n00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:27.730\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Yvonne Smith.\n\n335\n00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:29.838\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n336\n00:18:29.838 --> 00:18:33.058\n[SOUND]\n\n",

to another great\nepisode of Office Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.620\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, well guess what?\n\n5\n00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.360\nWe're back with more in our\nseries of Outlook on the web.\n\n6\n00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.430\nAnd joining us back in the studio, yet\nagain, our good friend, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.212\nVonne, welcome back, how's it going today?\n\n8\n00:00:29.212 --> 00:00:31.867\n&gt;&gt; Man, I'm good.\n\n9\n00:00:31.867 --> 00:00:32.889\n&gt;&gt; Amazing?\n\n10\n00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:35.523\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was trying to find some-\n&gt;&gt; Punctual?\n\n11\n00:00:35.523 --> 00:00:38.518\n&gt;&gt; Punctual, I was trying to find\nsomething with a T since we're talking\n\n12\n00:00:38.518 --> 00:00:41.294\nabout tasks, and then I was like,\nI don't wanna say terrible.\n\n13\n00:00:41.294 --> 00:00:42.978\n&gt;&gt; Terrific.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah terrific, man,\n\n14\n00:00:42.978 --> 00:00:44.612\nsee I was going for it.\n\n15\n00:00:44.612 --> 00:00:45.825\n&gt;&gt; Walking thesaurus.\n\n16\n00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:48.765\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah didn't do so\ngood on that one.\n\n17\n00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:52.137\nBut yes ladies and gentlemen,\nwe are gonna talk about tasks, and\n\n18\n00:00:52.137 --> 00:00:54.657\nwe're gonna stay on task, and\n\n19\n00:00:54.657 --> 00:00:59.747\nwhat we do to make ourselves on task,\nis we write ourselves a to-do list, right?\n\n20\n00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:01.886\nHey, I gotta do this, check it off.\n\n21\n00:01:01.886 --> 00:01:05.870\nI love to physically write them and\ntake the pencil and cross them out.\n\n22\n00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.600\n&gt;&gt; You kinda talked about\nthis in another episode,\n\n23\n00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.400\nwhere we had the ability to actually\nhave little check marks on our Emails,\n\n24\n00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.250\nand kinda use our Inbox or\nanother folder as a to-do list.\n\n25\n00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.570\n&gt;&gt; You've been paying attention.\n\n26\n00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.334\nI love it.\n\n27\n00:01:17.334 --> 00:01:19.375\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes those flags, right?\n\n28\n00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:20.030\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n29\n00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.920\n&gt;&gt; Well they're directly\nassociated with tasks.\n\n30\n00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.000\nBecause if you think about it,\nwhen we flag an email we're saying hey,\n\n31\n00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.090\nthis is gonna be put on my\nto-do list to followup with it.\n\n32\n00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.020\nAnd I might have even pulled it up,\nwhen we flag it,\n\n33\n00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.890\nthey get put-\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n\n34\n00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.417\n&gt;&gt; Did I?\n\n35\n00:01:35.417 --> 00:01:36.152\nOkay [LAUGH].\n\n36\n00:01:36.152 --> 00:01:37.243\n&gt;&gt; So I remember it.\n\n37\n00:01:37.243 --> 00:01:39.268\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See, I'm always glad that you're\n\n38\n00:01:39.268 --> 00:01:42.773\nhere to keep me in check,\nbecause I can't remember a lot of things.\n\n39\n00:01:42.773 --> 00:01:44.628\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like my name.\n\n40\n00:01:44.628 --> 00:01:45.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty much.\n\n41\n00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.760\n&gt;&gt; Where do I live?\n\n42\n00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.600\n&gt;&gt; It's happened where we start the show,\nor when we sign off,\n\n43\n00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.585\nand I don't remember my name.\n\n44\n00:01:52.585 --> 00:01:54.344\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I love Vonn's blackout moments,\n\n45\n00:01:54.344 --> 00:01:55.105\nladies and gentleman.\n\n46\n00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:56.774\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They are fun to watch.\n\n47\n00:01:56.774 --> 00:01:58.032\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n48\n00:01:58.032 --> 00:01:58.547\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n49\n00:01:58.547 --> 00:02:01.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so why don't we go ahead and\n\n50\n00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.347\nget started with tasks, and there's of\ncourse, two ways to get to our task,\n\n51\n00:02:06.347 --> 00:02:10.660\njust the same way there was two ways for\nus to get to our people, right?\n\n52\n00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.990\nWe could go from our main menu right here,\n\n53\n00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.940\nand you can see right\nover there we have tasks.\n\n54\n00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.060\nNow it will open up in a a separate tab.\n\n55\n00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.430\nAnd I will say now I don't know if this is\njust a me thing, but notice on here, there\n\n56\n00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.900\nis nothing over here in the left hand task\npane, when I went from the main menu.\n\n57\n00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.670\nThis might be a Chrome thing of where,\nI actually\n\n58\n00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.800\ndidn't test this in another browser,\nI will be completely honest with that.\n\n59\n00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.629\nBut it seems to me, from my set up right\nnow at this point in time, when I go\n\n60\n00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.406\nahead and use the task for my main\nmenu it doesn't pull up the task pane.\n\n61\n00:02:47.406 --> 00:02:51.830\nBut if I go from, and I'll close\nthis tab out, if I go from my mail,\n\n62\n00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.137\ndown here to the minimal navigation and\ngo to tasks notice this comes up, okay?\n\n63\n00:02:57.137 --> 00:03:00.221\nSo maybe it's just a me thing,\nmaybe it's a virtual machine,\n\n64\n00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.800\nI don't know where to place\nthe blame really [LAUGH].\n\n65\n00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.672\n&gt;&gt; You can't imagine it can be\na virtual machine thing because this is\n\n66\n00:03:07.672 --> 00:03:08.810\nall in the web.\n\n67\n00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.250\nThis is inside a browser being\npumped across from Officer 65, so.\n\n68\n00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.920\n&gt;&gt; That is true.\n\n69\n00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.570\nI'm just reaching for straws right now.\n\n70\n00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.630\n&gt;&gt; Something's wrong.\n\n71\n00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.670\n&gt;&gt; But I have the work around,\nthat if I go through the mail and\n\n72\n00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.670\ndown to the mini navigation bar\nat the bottom, then it brings\n\n73\n00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.710\nup the different items that I need to\nshow you, in the interface of tasks.\n\n74\n00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.420\nSo that's my workaround,\nif it doesn't work for you either.\n\n75\n00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.640\nSo back on those flagged messages,\nif I go over to the mail,\n\n76\n00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.870\nand I wonder if this is a new thing\nbecause I don't remember it, highlighting.\n\n77\n00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.844\nYou see how it's kind of\nlike yellowish right here?\n\n78\n00:03:44.844 --> 00:03:46.270\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do.\n\n79\n00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.575\n&gt;&gt; I don't know when that happened,\nbecause even after the show,\n\n80\n00:03:49.575 --> 00:03:51.330\nwe've been flagging emails and\nit didn't show.\n\n81\n00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.001\nI don't know if it's because it's past or-\n&gt;&gt; It must be one of those rolling update\n\n82\n00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:55.860\nfeatures that they've been putting out.\n\n83\n00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not sure, but at first\nI was like, is that a category thing?\n\n84\n00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.200\nI'm like, no because as soon as I\ntake this, and I say pictures or\n\n85\n00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.940\nPic of Fuego, and I turn on that hey,\nI'm done, I've checked this off.\n\n86\n00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.640\nNotice how the highlighting goes away.\n\n87\n00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.040\nSo it has to be associated, I'm assuming,\nwith and look at that, you know what?\n\n88\n00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.655\nThis has got to be something new,\ncuz look, see how this is red?\n\n89\n00:04:17.655 --> 00:04:19.590\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz this is important.\n\n90\n00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.170\nSo I'm wondering if they're\ndoing this highlighting-\n\n91\n00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.120\n&gt;&gt; So remember I was saying how\n\n92\n00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.320\nI love the feature of saying, this is\nimportant, or sensitivity, or whatever,\n\n93\n00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.545\nbut it was kind of small?\n\n94\n00:04:28.545 --> 00:04:29.429\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n95\n00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:30.185\n&gt;&gt; Not any more.\n\n96\n00:04:30.185 --> 00:04:31.006\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n97\n00:04:31.006 --> 00:04:31.836\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Right yeah so\n\n98\n00:04:31.836 --> 00:04:34.866\nI'm just gonna say I'm\nassuming this is what it is\n\n99\n00:04:34.866 --> 00:04:36.840\n&gt;&gt; They're watching our show, aren't they?\n\n100\n00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.863\n&gt;&gt; They are.\n&gt;&gt; And they're making it,\n\n101\n00:04:38.863 --> 00:04:40.839\n[LAUGH] that would be cool [LAUGH].\n\n102\n00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:42.259\n&gt;&gt; They're making a task list.\n\n103\n00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:42.925\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n104\n00:04:42.925 --> 00:04:47.485\nI'm assuming this is a brand new thing,\nat the time this is recording,\n\n105\n00:04:47.485 --> 00:04:49.014\nthat it was doing this.\n\n106\n00:04:49.014 --> 00:04:51.660\n&gt;&gt; Big Brother's watching,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n107\n00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nYou saw this.\n\n108\n00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.610\nYou've seen the other episodes,\nit wasn't doing this.\n\n109\n00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.960\nAnyway, so you can see that when\nI check this off as completed,\n\n110\n00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.320\nthen the highlighting goes away.\n\n111\n00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.434\nBut we were using this as, hey, I wanna\nmake sure to go ahead and flag this.\n\n112\n00:05:03.434 --> 00:05:07.570\nI actually flagged this back now, and\nif I come back over to our tasks,\n\n113\n00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.510\nthis is where they will\nbe associated with,\n\n114\n00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.425\nbecause we really are, like I said, making\na to do list, to follow up with this.\n\n115\n00:05:14.425 --> 00:05:17.068\nNow, the environment or\nthe interface of our task,\n\n116\n00:05:17.068 --> 00:05:18.999\nthere's a couple different things.\n\n117\n00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:21.201\nNow I do have the reading\npane on right over here,\n\n118\n00:05:21.201 --> 00:05:24.170\ncuz that's just something that I have for\neverything right now.\n\n119\n00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.810\nBut you can see my tasks, and\nwe have flagged items and tasks.\n\n120\n00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.270\nAnd that's where the icons\nare gonna make a big difference.\n\n121\n00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.170\nSo let's go ahead and\njust zoom in, so you can see, and\n\n122\n00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.148\nwe pointed this out I think\nin the contacts, I believe.\n\n123\n00:05:40.148 --> 00:05:44.216\nWhen we deleted them, when we were showing\nthe icons of like this is associated with,\n\n124\n00:05:44.216 --> 00:05:45.580\nsorry let me stop hovering.\n\n125\n00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.500\nThis is associated with a email,\nbut that's different than here.\n\n126\n00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.125\nSee where it says eat lunch?\n\n127\n00:05:51.125 --> 00:05:53.590\n[LAUGH] yeah, I made a task to do that.\n\n128\n00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.810\nSee how it also has a different icon,\n\n129\n00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.860\nit has a little clipboard\nwith little swirly things?\n\n130\n00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.568\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Well, that indicates that,\n\n131\n00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:05.060\nthat's a recurring task, something that\nI've said that has to happen every day.\n\n132\n00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.237\nOr there is some type of reiteration\nof that particular task,\n\n133\n00:06:08.237 --> 00:06:11.611\nwhether it's every month,\nevery week, those types of things.\n\n134\n00:06:11.611 --> 00:06:17.662\nSo if you think about keeping yourself\norganized like say, you have to run your\n\n135\n00:06:17.662 --> 00:06:22.809\nHR report every two weeks on a Monday,\nyou could put that as a task.\n\n136\n00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:26.375\nAnd you can also put that as\na appointment in your calendar, so\n\n137\n00:06:26.375 --> 00:06:29.170\ndepends on which way you wanna use it.\n\n138\n00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:33.340\nBut you can think about how you\nmight wanna use tasks to keep you,\n\n139\n00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.640\nwell, on task.\n\n140\n00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.930\nNotice I have a,\nTell Daniel to end the show.\n\n141\n00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.082\n[LAUGH] So I made a task for you,\nand you got a little kitty icon.\n\n142\n00:06:43.082 --> 00:06:43.680\nIsn't that cute?\n\n143\n00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.480\n&gt;&gt; It's very cute.\n\n144\n00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nNow those are charms.\n\n145\n00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.760\nThat's something that's a little newer and\nthis is not in the local version.\n\n146\n00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.890\nAt least not yet, right now, so\nthat's just kind of a cute way, again,\n\n147\n00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.230\nto just put that little personal\ntouch on your task right there.\n\n148\n00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.480\nSo we have this, now I do wanna point\nout that having a flagged item while\n\n149\n00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:11.190\nit's still a task, it's a type of task\nthat is different than a regular task.\n\n150\n00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.140\nHope you just followed that because\nI just said task a lot [LAUGH]\n\n151\n00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.100\nin a very short amount of time.\n\n152\n00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.480\nBut you notice if I go right over here,\nthere's that reminder, right?\n\n153\n00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:26.650\nBecause this is part of the details\nof the task that I set a reminder,\n\n154\n00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.845\nto remind you of when I'm ready to end\nthe show, and you can go on to the outro.\n\n155\n00:07:30.845 --> 00:07:33.600\n[LAUGH] Whoops, hello,\nwhy don't we go ahead, and\n\n156\n00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.525\nthat was a different reminder for\nmeeting my friend later.\n\n157\n00:07:36.525 --> 00:07:39.760\n[LAUGH] And that was my actual\nreal calendar back over on my-\n\n158\n00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.790\n&gt;&gt; So take your screenshots,\n\n159\n00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:41.780\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n160\n00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, on the [SOUND].\n\n161\n00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.460\nReally quick.\n\n162\n00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.140\nThere's not, there's nothing over there.\n\n163\n00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.680\nSo you can see that I have the Dismiss and\nDismiss All.\n\n164\n00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.503\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead,\nwe'll snooze this for 15 minutes, and\n\n165\n00:07:52.503 --> 00:07:54.972\nwe'll see if it comes back around.\n\n166\n00:07:54.972 --> 00:07:57.446\nSo Part of the task.\n\n167\n00:07:57.446 --> 00:08:02.720\nThat these are our normal tasks, if you\nwant to say, like order a cake for Wes?\n\n168\n00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.074\nWell guess what, I hope I did that,\nso I'm going to go-\n\n169\n00:08:05.074 --> 00:08:06.145\n&gt;&gt; He's on a low carb diet,\n\n170\n00:08:06.145 --> 00:08:07.370\nhe's not going to eat that.\n\n171\n00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.892\n&gt;&gt; So I'm just going to go ahead and\ncheck that off as complete, and\n\n172\n00:08:09.892 --> 00:08:11.444\nnotice then it goes away from the list.\n\n173\n00:08:11.444 --> 00:08:15.050\nBecause that's the whole idea\nhere is using your tasks.\n\n174\n00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:20.260\nBut your tasks do have different\ninformation that you could hold,\n\n175\n00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.503\nlike show tasks in episode.\n\n176\n00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:26.488\nAnd notice you can see over here that\nI've got like, what's the status,\n\n177\n00:08:26.488 --> 00:08:27.838\nthe percent completed,\n\n178\n00:08:27.838 --> 00:08:31.835\nthere's a lot of different things that\nyou can include within your task.\n\n179\n00:08:31.835 --> 00:08:35.149\nAnd it really kinda depends on\nalmost like on your organization.\n\n180\n00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:40.191\nSome organizations use tasks to be\nable to track different projects or\n\n181\n00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:44.121\nif they were doing phone calls,\nlike sales calls, and\n\n182\n00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:47.549\nthey could go ahead and\nthey actually use this.\n\n183\n00:08:47.549 --> 00:08:52.301\nThis is way back in the day but\nit's really all about how much you\n\n184\n00:08:52.301 --> 00:08:57.233\nwant to use the features and\ncapabilities of what is in a task, and\n\n185\n00:08:57.233 --> 00:09:01.000\nhow that's going to help\nyou be more efficient and\n\n186\n00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.505\neffective at your job or\njust in life of staying organized.\n\n187\n00:09:05.505 --> 00:09:10.221\nSo it's really how deep or\nhow much you want to use with it, but\n\n188\n00:09:10.221 --> 00:09:13.964\nwe'll go over all\nthe different pieces of that.\n\n189\n00:09:13.964 --> 00:09:17.874\nThose are the different things\nover on the left hand side.\n\n190\n00:09:17.874 --> 00:09:19.822\nI should go ahead and\nlet the personal task,\n\n191\n00:09:19.822 --> 00:09:23.098\nthat's just something that I've created,\nthere and there so it's in.\n\n192\n00:09:23.098 --> 00:09:27.627\nNotice that Daniel is in the personal\ntask right there and you can, well,\n\n193\n00:09:27.627 --> 00:09:28.659\nI'll show you.\n\n194\n00:09:28.659 --> 00:09:33.217\nYou can make more folders for\nyou tasks that you could go ahead and\n\n195\n00:09:33.217 --> 00:09:40.365\nstart sub categorizing if you want to say,\nyour different tasks and there's actually.\n\n196\n00:09:40.365 --> 00:09:44.112\nI'll just keep it for just a second, okay,\nremind me to come back to that place.\n\n197\n00:09:44.112 --> 00:09:45.730\nI'll give you a task.\n\n198\n00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.323\nTo-\n&gt;&gt; I'll try to remember,\n\n199\n00:09:47.323 --> 00:09:48.946\nit's not what it used to be.\n\n200\n00:09:48.946 --> 00:09:53.950\n&gt;&gt; To remind me to talk about\nthe folders and the organization of it.\n\n201\n00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:55.874\nAll righty, so\nlet's see where we're gonna go.\n\n202\n00:09:55.874 --> 00:09:56.379\nOkay.\n\n203\n00:09:56.379 --> 00:09:59.175\nNow how we can start using this filter.\n\n204\n00:09:59.175 --> 00:10:00.618\nThis is actually kinda neat.\n\n205\n00:10:00.618 --> 00:10:03.481\nI'm gonna go back up to just everything.\n\n206\n00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:06.563\nNotice right now that it's\nshowing me my active tasks.\n\n207\n00:10:06.563 --> 00:10:08.217\nSo this is our sort and filter.\n\n208\n00:10:08.217 --> 00:10:10.076\nWell, I have more task.\n\n209\n00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:12.040\nYou saw I did complete some.\n\n210\n00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.414\nIf I go to all of them,\nnow I can see everything like right there,\n\n211\n00:10:16.414 --> 00:10:18.119\nlike it's crossed out.\n\n212\n00:10:18.119 --> 00:10:19.674\nI actually completed that.\n\n213\n00:10:19.674 --> 00:10:23.165\nBut they were like details about that.\n\n214\n00:10:23.165 --> 00:10:24.726\nAnd order cake for Wes.\n\n215\n00:10:24.726 --> 00:10:27.000\nThat was one we just did\non this particular show.\n\n216\n00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.442\nSo you can see that it's got completed.\n\n217\n00:10:29.442 --> 00:10:31.276\nIt is 100% completed.\n\n218\n00:10:31.276 --> 00:10:35.079\nSo it still has stuff inside\nof it if you wanna say.\n\n219\n00:10:35.079 --> 00:10:37.450\nIt's just that I crossed it off the list.\n\n220\n00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:43.208\nSo knowing that you have that filter\nthere, of like all my tasks are deleted.\n\n221\n00:10:43.208 --> 00:10:43.971\nNo they're not.\n\n222\n00:10:43.971 --> 00:10:44.767\nThey're not deleted.\n\n223\n00:10:44.767 --> 00:10:46.233\nThey're still there.\n\n224\n00:10:46.233 --> 00:10:49.020\nSo, you have to determine\nhow to filter them.\n\n225\n00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.080\nAnd if you really wanted this,\nlike okay, I'm done with this.\n\n226\n00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.880\nI want this off the list altogether\nthen you wanna throw it away.\n\n227\n00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.443\nSo, having that kind of organization and\nknowing that if you're just on active you\n\n228\n00:11:01.443 --> 00:11:05.421\nmight have hundreds of tasks that\nare already done then organize them and\n\n229\n00:11:05.421 --> 00:11:07.458\nthrow them in the trash right there.\n\n230\n00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:10.151\nSo you can have all the active overdue.\n\n231\n00:11:10.151 --> 00:11:15.077\nCuz when we look at making a task, whether\nyou can set a due date on there and\n\n232\n00:11:15.077 --> 00:11:16.838\nthen you're completed.\n\n233\n00:11:16.838 --> 00:11:20.680\nAnd then how are you gonna sort them\nby the start date, your status.\n\n234\n00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.944\nAll the different things of what you can\ndo of putting in the details of the task.\n\n235\n00:11:23.944 --> 00:11:25.107\nSo you have your sorts.\n\n236\n00:11:25.107 --> 00:11:28.156\nAnd then, do you want the oldest or\nyour newest on top?\n\n237\n00:11:28.156 --> 00:11:32.737\nSo that little Filter and\nSort button is pretty handy for\n\n238\n00:11:32.737 --> 00:11:36.740\nthe different things that\nyou might want to see.\n\n239\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:41.731\nAll righty, so let's go ahead and\nlook at some already existing tasks and\n\n240\n00:11:41.731 --> 00:11:43.490\nstart updating them.\n\n241\n00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:48.490\nSo right in here,\nlet's go with an actual task task.\n\n242\n00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:52.610\nLet's go with plan JC\nsurprise birthday party.\n\n243\n00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.599\nSee, this was quite a while ago.\n\n244\n00:11:54.599 --> 00:11:57.593\nWell, if you know what\nthe date is right now.\n\n245\n00:11:57.593 --> 00:11:59.140\n[LAUGH] For me right now.\n\n246\n00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.318\nSo let's go ahead and open this.\n\n247\n00:12:00.318 --> 00:12:03.092\nAll I did was go ahead and double click.\n\n248\n00:12:03.092 --> 00:12:04.026\nNo, I'm not gonna double click it.\n\n249\n00:12:04.026 --> 00:12:05.902\nI'm gonna come over here.\n\n250\n00:12:05.902 --> 00:12:08.854\nAnd then I'm going to edit it.\n\n251\n00:12:08.854 --> 00:12:12.761\nNow, also just know really quickly, notice\nyou do have, this is kind of a funny thing\n\n252\n00:12:12.761 --> 00:12:16.480\nwe talk about categorizing throughout\nthere but you don't see the categories.\n\n253\n00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.558\nYou do actually see\nthe categories over here.\n\n254\n00:12:19.558 --> 00:12:23.300\nSo I'm kind of throwing a couple\ndifferent things together but\n\n255\n00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.337\nnotice that you can go ahead and\nuse those different\n\n256\n00:12:26.337 --> 00:12:31.210\ncategories to help you organize yourself\nbut for now we're just gonna go ahead and\n\n257\n00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.836\nedit this in a separate window so\nit makes it a little easier.\n\n258\n00:12:34.836 --> 00:12:37.953\nThen we get the details of the task.\n\n259\n00:12:37.953 --> 00:12:40.975\nThere you go.\n[LAUGH] It is telling me that this task is\n\n260\n00:12:40.975 --> 00:12:41.711\noverdue.\n\n261\n00:12:41.711 --> 00:12:42.554\nWhy?\nWell,\n\n262\n00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:45.585\nbecause I said that it\nwas due on June 2016.\n\n263\n00:12:45.585 --> 00:12:48.882\nSo, that's not\n&gt;&gt; We're a little past that.\n\n264\n00:12:48.882 --> 00:12:50.922\n&gt;&gt; We're a little past that, right.\n\n265\n00:12:50.922 --> 00:12:53.937\nWhy don't we go ahead and\nclick the Edit button now and\n\n266\n00:12:53.937 --> 00:12:57.300\nyou can see that there are some\nthings that we can do in here.\n\n267\n00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.816\nWe can change the due because\nmaybe we realize like his surprise\n\n268\n00:13:02.816 --> 00:13:07.928\nparty is not in June,\nit's gonna be in September 20th.\n\n269\n00:13:07.928 --> 00:13:08.478\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n270\n00:13:08.478 --> 00:13:09.940\n&gt;&gt; That's sounds good.\n\n271\n00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.727\nAnd if you don't see all\nother details in here,\n\n272\n00:13:12.727 --> 00:13:15.665\nit might be because you\nneed to show more details.\n\n273\n00:13:15.665 --> 00:13:17.033\nSo when am I gonna start?\n\n274\n00:13:17.033 --> 00:13:22.571\nWell I'm gonna start planning that\nuntil next, that's Labor Day, isn't?\n\n275\n00:13:22.571 --> 00:13:25.216\nSo why don't we go and\npick the 30th, right?\n\n276\n00:13:25.216 --> 00:13:25.810\nIs that the right one?\n\n277\n00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.506\nNo, that's September.\n\n278\n00:13:27.506 --> 00:13:29.079\nWe're just gonna say that's the right day,\nokay.\n\n279\n00:13:29.079 --> 00:13:33.300\n[LAUGH] Of when we're gonna start it and\nwhat is my status?\n\n280\n00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.320\nMaybe we'll go ahead and,\nwaiting on others.\n\n281\n00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.958\nSo I'm waiting for\nyou to finish the guest list Daniel.\n\n282\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.297\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's taking time-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n283\n00:13:39.297 --> 00:13:41.940\n&gt;&gt; Because no one's RSVPing,\n\n284\n00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:42.988\nand-\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n285\n00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:46.218\nyou can see that you have some\nstatus that you can put in there.\n\n286\n00:13:46.218 --> 00:13:50.334\nAnd then you also have different\ncompletion rates, the priority for you,\n\n287\n00:13:50.334 --> 00:13:51.850\nwhether it's high or low.\n\n288\n00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.010\nThe reminders.\n\n289\n00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.502\nThat's something you can set.\n\n290\n00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:56.164\nThe repetition.\n\n291\n00:13:56.164 --> 00:13:58.440\nThat was that whole eating lunch.\n\n292\n00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:04.250\nI put a repetitive task of every day,\nevery third Thursday.\n\n293\n00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.097\nSo it understands the dates\nthat you're setting and\n\n294\n00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:11.460\nwhere you could go ahead and then make\nthat re-occurrence of your tasks.\n\n295\n00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:16.320\nAnd this is one of those things,\nit has total work hours, billing, mileage.\n\n296\n00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.229\nYou can see why in some of these fields\nthat they already have four tasks\n\n297\n00:14:20.229 --> 00:14:22.624\nwhere companies might actually use this.\n\n298\n00:14:22.624 --> 00:14:27.119\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate a task of travelling to Chicago for\n\n299\n00:14:27.119 --> 00:14:31.378\na convention and\nI'm gonna put all those stuff within this.\n\n300\n00:14:31.378 --> 00:14:34.477\nAnd then send that task to my boss.\n\n301\n00:14:34.477 --> 00:14:36.445\nNow I just said something.\n\n302\n00:14:36.445 --> 00:14:37.842\nSend that task to my boss.\n\n303\n00:14:37.842 --> 00:14:43.593\nWell, there's a bunch of things that\nyou have limitations in Outlook for\n\n304\n00:14:43.593 --> 00:14:48.895\nWeb that you can't do unless you're\nin the local version, right?\n\n305\n00:14:48.895 --> 00:14:50.085\nSuch as-\n&gt;&gt; We bring it up against that\n\n306\n00:14:50.085 --> 00:14:50.688\nwall, don't we?\n\n307\n00:14:50.688 --> 00:14:54.666\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and since I just said like\nthe whole, you have this here,\n\n308\n00:14:54.666 --> 00:14:57.540\nthere's something as\nyou can forward a task,\n\n309\n00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.091\nyou could also assign task in\na local version of Outlook.\n\n310\n00:15:01.091 --> 00:15:01.820\nYou can't do that.\n\n311\n00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:07.320\nYou cannot assign task to\nothers in the web version.\n\n312\n00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.871\nYou cannot receive status updates or\ntasks updates.\n\n313\n00:15:10.871 --> 00:15:15.794\nThat's another thing that if you have\nsomebody you can send a report of\n\n314\n00:15:15.794 --> 00:15:18.882\nthe percentage completed and everything,\n\n315\n00:15:18.882 --> 00:15:24.568\nkind of like an incremental status update\nfor whoever you need to report that to.\n\n316\n00:15:24.568 --> 00:15:27.946\nSo that's something that's not\navailable in the web version.\n\n317\n00:15:27.946 --> 00:15:29.941\nAnd you cannot forward a task,\n\n318\n00:15:29.941 --> 00:15:33.404\nthat are all different things\nyou can do in the local.\n\n319\n00:15:33.404 --> 00:15:38.396\nSo just keep that in mind, but you can\nsee all the different features in here.\n\n320\n00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:41.411\nAnd then I could add more\nnotes within the task.\n\n321\n00:15:41.411 --> 00:15:46.117\nAnd then once I click Save then any of\nthe details that I have just changed\n\n322\n00:15:46.117 --> 00:15:47.852\ngoes ahead and get there.\n\n323\n00:15:47.852 --> 00:15:51.499\nNotice now that I've changed the due\ndate it's gone towards the top.\n\n324\n00:15:51.499 --> 00:15:56.223\nSo now I know that I need\nto start looking at that.\n\n325\n00:15:56.223 --> 00:15:59.242\nBack on those categories,\nyou can take this from here,\n\n326\n00:15:59.242 --> 00:16:03.520\nyou can right-click on it or\nyou have the different options up here.\n\n327\n00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.357\nAnd categories, we've talked about this,\n\n328\n00:16:06.357 --> 00:16:11.072\nif we're keeping those color coded\nlabels on all of your different items.\n\n329\n00:16:11.072 --> 00:16:16.454\nAnd then, let me scroll out, using the\nsearch functionality to use that category,\n\n330\n00:16:16.454 --> 00:16:18.950\ncolon, and then whatever the name is.\n\n331\n00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.350\nAnd it will pull up,\nI've actually tried this.\n\n332\n00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.968\nIt will pull up the task,\nwhen you do the search mail and people,\n\n333\n00:16:24.968 --> 00:16:27.517\nit'll bring them up, which is pretty neat.\n\n334\n00:16:27.517 --> 00:16:29.663\nAnd then you also have the charms, right?\n\n335\n00:16:29.663 --> 00:16:30.540\n&gt;&gt; Your favorite.\n\n336\n00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.980\n&gt;&gt; I know, I love those things.\n\n337\n00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.240\nSo you can see right here,\nsince it is a birthday party or\n\n338\n00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.370\na surprise party,\nwhy don't I give it a charm of balloons.\n\n339\n00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:43.180\nAnd now I can use the balloons as some fun\nstuff that I can do for adding that task.\n\n340\n00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.760\n&gt;&gt; And that's kind of a cool\nlittle quick visual reminder,\n\n341\n00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.290\njust right off the top of your,\nI see the balloons, it's a birthday party,\n\n342\n00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:52.085\nit's a celebration of some sort\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so that's a nice thing to do.\n\n343\n00:16:52.085 --> 00:16:54.986\nAnd then,\nwe were updating an existing task but\n\n344\n00:16:54.986 --> 00:16:57.970\nyou can always start with a new one,\nright?\n\n345\n00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:02.988\nIt's gonna go through the same\nthings that I just showed you in\n\n346\n00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:09.473\nupdating a task cuz I can go ahead and\nsay, we need to feed the fuego, all right?\n\n347\n00:17:09.473 --> 00:17:12.740\nBecause God forbid,\nwe don't feed him, he will.\n\n348\n00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.685\n&gt;&gt; Get some gasoline?\n\n349\n00:17:14.685 --> 00:17:16.351\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah he broke one of my\n\n350\n00:17:16.351 --> 00:17:17.900\nfavorite cups last night.\n\n351\n00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.947\nCuz, can't leave it on the counter\ncuz he's just [SOUND],\n\n352\n00:17:21.947 --> 00:17:24.102\nI'm hungry, and just crash.\n\n353\n00:17:24.102 --> 00:17:27.020\nAnd of course then he jumps up like,\nI got your attention now, right?\n\n354\n00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.128\n&gt;&gt; So the foods coming soon?\n\n355\n00:17:28.128 --> 00:17:30.794\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, no he went outside.\n\n356\n00:17:30.794 --> 00:17:33.560\n[LAUGH] So\nyou can see we have our due dates.\n\n357\n00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.000\nAnd then we have our more details.\n\n358\n00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.487\nSo the exact same things\nthat we just went through.\n\n359\n00:17:37.487 --> 00:17:41.623\nWe can always pop it out into\na new window if we wanted to,\n\n360\n00:17:41.623 --> 00:17:44.380\nand then bring out everything.\n\n361\n00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.500\nYou can do it,\nI know you can, there we go.\n\n362\n00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.660\nAnd we can go ahead and\nshow some more details with that.\n\n363\n00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:54.532\nSo pretty much same things with\nthe updates that you can do with\n\n364\n00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:58.007\nthe new tasks and setting our recurrences.\n\n365\n00:17:58.007 --> 00:17:59.340\nAll right, I'm looking at my notes.\n\n366\n00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.940\nI already went over what you can and\ncannot do in, and yes,\n\n367\n00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:04.930\nI want to leave you.\n\n368\n00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.630\nSo what you can and cannot do.\n\n369\n00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:11.590\nJust because I have this here,\nnotice that in your tasks,\n\n370\n00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.750\nsee there's some cool things.\n\n371\n00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.370\nAnd this is where, in this particular\nview in the local outlook,\n\n372\n00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.960\nif I click on this,\nthere's some different things.\n\n373\n00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.695\nHere let me actually open it up.\n\n374\n00:18:20.695 --> 00:18:23.881\nNotice there are some,\nthat's actually a meeting.\n\n375\n00:18:23.881 --> 00:18:26.120\nLet's go to plan the party.\n\n376\n00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:26.630\nThere we go.\n\n377\n00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:27.420\nSo there we go.\n\n378\n00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:32.215\nSee where it says like the assigned task,\nand then send a status report and\n\n379\n00:18:32.215 --> 00:18:36.555\nforward this particular all\nthat local version anyway.\n\n380\n00:18:36.555 --> 00:18:38.575\nSo tasks are really cool.\n\n381\n00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:41.187\nI like them, I do use them honestly.\n\n382\n00:18:41.187 --> 00:18:44.385\nSo I do a lot of flagging and\nthen it comes into here.\n\n383\n00:18:44.385 --> 00:18:49.010\nBut I will assign tasks that I\ndon't need to put in my calendar.\n\n384\n00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:51.810\nSo again, some people just use\ntheir calendar for everything.\n\n385\n00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.740\nThey use it like a task.\n\n386\n00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:54.562\nTotally fine.\n\n387\n00:18:54.562 --> 00:18:59.550\nIt's up to you how you wanna organize\nwell, your life and how it works that way.\n\n388\n00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.792\nSo that's tasks in a nutshell.\n\n389\n00:19:01.792 --> 00:19:04.660\nThere's not really much more\nI can talk about with tasks.\n\n390\n00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.940\n[LAUGH] There we go.\n\n391\n00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.524\nSo let's move on to notes.\n\n392\n00:19:08.524 --> 00:19:12.507\nNow, notes is a very small,\nlittle section of this because,\n\n393\n00:19:12.507 --> 00:19:16.223\nwell, you can't create them\nin the web version, yeah.\n\n394\n00:19:16.223 --> 00:19:18.752\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, thanks for watching.\n\n395\n00:19:18.752 --> 00:19:20.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, so\n\n396\n00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:24.770\nif you're used to the regular Outlook,\nthe local Outlook.\n\n397\n00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.574\nThat's not Outlook, it's down here.\n\n398\n00:19:26.574 --> 00:19:29.564\n[LAUGH] We have this little\nguy down here called notes and\n\n399\n00:19:29.564 --> 00:19:32.470\nthey are really just like\ndigital post-it notes.\n\n400\n00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:37.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and I can make one and I can say,\n\n401\n00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:41.240\nhello Daniel and\nthen I go ahead and close it.\n\n402\n00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.970\nAnd you can do these cute little things,\nand it's really,\n\n403\n00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.410\nI don't how else to say it.\n\n404\n00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:46.475\nIt's just notes, okay?\n\n405\n00:19:46.475 --> 00:19:50.711\n&gt;&gt; Do they even show up in other\nplaces other than the notes area,\n\n406\n00:19:50.711 --> 00:19:53.735\nlike do they show up on your mail slide,\nor?\n\n407\n00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:54.382\n&gt;&gt; No, not really.\n\n408\n00:19:54.382 --> 00:19:56.295\nThey're just notes.\n\n409\n00:19:56.295 --> 00:19:57.552\nIt's just kind of-\n&gt;&gt; Kinda useless.\n\n410\n00:19:57.552 --> 00:20:00.431\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Kind of,\n\n411\n00:20:00.431 --> 00:20:05.001\n[LAUGH] to be completely honest with you.\n\n412\n00:20:05.001 --> 00:20:09.256\nI only show this because it is part of\nthe interface, and part of Outlook.\n\n413\n00:20:09.256 --> 00:20:10.298\nBut how it kind of-\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n414\n00:20:10.298 --> 00:20:13.720\nI guess it'll be one of those things that\nyou just like, I saw this cool thing.\n\n415\n00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.514\nNo, it's inside of Outlook and\nI started using them.\n\n416\n00:20:16.514 --> 00:20:17.820\nNow I'm used to using them.\n\n417\n00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:18.610\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n418\n00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.490\nAnd there was when you could go ahead and\ndrag it out onto your desktop and\n\n419\n00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:22.314\nhave a little note.\n\n420\n00:20:22.314 --> 00:20:24.966\nBut there's now so\nmany different things that you can do-\n\n421\n00:20:24.966 --> 00:20:26.263\n&gt;&gt; That does that?\n\n422\n00:20:26.263 --> 00:20:27.242\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n423\n00:20:27.242 --> 00:20:29.000\nSo, it's one of those things,\n\n424\n00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.328\nthey haven't gone away\n&gt;&gt; But right here,\n\n425\n00:20:32.328 --> 00:20:36.735\nthere is no notes section\nin the mini navigation bar.\n\n426\n00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:41.057\nBut if you're on an Office 365\naccount that does have like notes and\n\n427\n00:20:41.057 --> 00:20:43.780\neverything like that, you come over here.\n\n428\n00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:48.600\nIt's actually just a folder\ninside of your mail section.\n\n429\n00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.600\nSo there's your notes.\n\n430\n00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.332\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But you can't-\n\n431\n00:20:51.332 --> 00:20:52.085\n&gt;&gt; That's not too bad.\n\n432\n00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:55.302\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you also see them,\nbut you can't create them.\n\n433\n00:20:55.302 --> 00:20:59.723\nYou can't make anymore notes there.\n\n434\n00:20:59.723 --> 00:21:02.465\nIf I go to new,\nit's just gonna be a new mail.\n\n435\n00:21:02.465 --> 00:21:08.050\nSo it's like a view only type\nthing from a local version.\n\n436\n00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:08.940\n&gt;&gt; Very strange.\n\n437\n00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.848\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if you don't have a local\nversion or you've never had that,\n\n438\n00:21:11.848 --> 00:21:13.638\nthen you'll never see anything in there.\n\n439\n00:21:13.638 --> 00:21:16.245\n&gt;&gt; I would create an Outlook.\n\n440\n00:21:16.245 --> 00:21:20.432\nThat way I could make an email with notes\nin the subject line any time I saw notes\n\n441\n00:21:20.432 --> 00:21:24.276\nthat were sent to the notes folder,\nand it would create a new note.\n\n442\n00:21:24.276 --> 00:21:25.553\n&gt;&gt; That's cute, good idea.\n\n443\n00:21:25.553 --> 00:21:26.121\n&gt;&gt; I'm smart.\n\n444\n00:21:26.121 --> 00:21:30.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's perfect, so yeah.\n\n445\n00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.770\nAnd I have had people or\n\n446\n00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:40.110\nsong I don't have notes aside of well, are\nyou on a network, or do you have a domain?\n\n447\n00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:41.600\nAre you on an exchanged server,\nand of course,\n\n448\n00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.340\nthe next one says,\nI don't know what that means.\n\n449\n00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.992\nSo it's like you do have to have that\nset-up for that to be a part of it.\n\n450\n00:21:46.992 --> 00:21:52.510\nSo that's okay if you don't see it and\nso as you can't create a note.\n\n451\n00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.130\nIt's not that big of a deal.\n\n452\n00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:59.750\nAnd then I believe that's what we've got\ngoing on there [LAUGH] with my notes.\n\n453\n00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.640\nBut, I have to circle back around.\n\n454\n00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.670\nI gave you a task.\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n\n455\n00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:06.047\nYou told me to remind you to do something.\n\n456\n00:22:06.047 --> 00:22:07.246\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I did.\n\n457\n00:22:07.246 --> 00:22:08.092\n&gt;&gt; See?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n458\n00:22:08.092 --> 00:22:11.788\nSo, cuz soon as I said,\nwell that's all I have to say about tasks,\n\n459\n00:22:11.788 --> 00:22:13.840\nI'm realized like, no you don't.\n\n460\n00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.828\nSo I was like-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n461\n00:22:14.828 --> 00:22:15.892\n&gt;&gt; My little on my head,\n\n462\n00:22:15.892 --> 00:22:17.560\nnow you gotta show them\nhow to create folders.\n\n463\n00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:19.714\n&gt;&gt; Folders?\n\n464\n00:22:19.714 --> 00:22:22.219\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Haven't we created folders throughout\n\n465\n00:22:22.219 --> 00:22:25.668\nthe [INAUDIBLE] on everything\n&gt;&gt; Yes,and so we gotta do it on the task.\n\n466\n00:22:25.668 --> 00:22:28.441\n[LAUGH] So let's come back down and see.\n\n467\n00:22:28.441 --> 00:22:32.187\nSo let's circle back around, cuz we know\nthe notes doesn't really do much for\n\n468\n00:22:32.187 --> 00:22:34.290\nus within the web version.\n\n469\n00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:35.662\nBack on the tasks.\n\n470\n00:22:35.662 --> 00:22:38.596\nSo we talk about, hey,\nI want to organize myself,\n\n471\n00:22:38.596 --> 00:22:41.620\nespecially if I start really using task.\n\n472\n00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.420\nYou can come over to\nthe left navigation pane.\n\n473\n00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:47.990\nAnd you can right click up on the My Task,\nand you can create a new folder.\n\n474\n00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.050\nAnd let's go ahead and say, you know what?\n\n475\n00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:51.761\nWe're gonna make a Daniel folder.\n\n476\n00:22:51.761 --> 00:22:56.060\nJust so I can keep you on task\nto remind me to stay on task.\n\n477\n00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.814\n&gt;&gt; I'm very absent minded.\n\n478\n00:22:57.814 --> 00:23:01.134\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Actually no you're not,\nbecause I know you.\n\n479\n00:23:01.134 --> 00:23:04.194\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm good at remembering weird\nfacts of like things from my life but\n\n480\n00:23:04.194 --> 00:23:07.065\nif you asked me to tell you to\ndo something, I'll forget it.\n\n481\n00:23:07.065 --> 00:23:08.504\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nthat is actually two different things.\n\n482\n00:23:08.504 --> 00:23:11.264\n&gt;&gt; I forget things all the time,\nwhere's my wallet?\n\n483\n00:23:11.264 --> 00:23:11.766\nIt's at home.\n\n484\n00:23:11.766 --> 00:23:13.448\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay,\n\n485\n00:23:13.448 --> 00:23:15.176\nwell I've give you that one.\n\n486\n00:23:15.176 --> 00:23:20.610\nAll right, so you can see that I've made a\nnew folder or like a personal folder here.\n\n487\n00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:23.185\nOkay, do you remember with\ncontacts remember what we said?\n\n488\n00:23:23.185 --> 00:23:24.425\n&gt;&gt; What about them?\n\n489\n00:23:24.425 --> 00:23:26.962\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We said a lot of things about contacts.\n\n490\n00:23:26.962 --> 00:23:28.654\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] About how when I went ahead and\n\n491\n00:23:28.654 --> 00:23:30.730\nstarted making folders\nI couldn't move them?\n\n492\n00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:31.390\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n493\n00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:32.020\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n494\n00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:32.911\nThat was kind of a pain.\n\n495\n00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:34.150\n&gt;&gt; That was kind of a pain.\n\n496\n00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.971\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay,\nwell guess what you can do with tasks?\n\n497\n00:23:36.971 --> 00:23:39.696\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Fun.\n\n498\n00:23:39.696 --> 00:23:41.520\nSo you could see here.\n\n499\n00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.530\nIf I got to Water the plants,\nright, and I want to go ahead and\n\n500\n00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:48.510\nmove that into your folder for any reason.\n\n501\n00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:52.990\nIf I right click on, look it just\nsays right there, move, right?\n\n502\n00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:54.085\n&gt;&gt; It seems very simple.\n\n503\n00:23:54.085 --> 00:23:56.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Make a move feature.\n\n504\n00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.404\n&gt;&gt; Do that in the context.\n\n505\n00:23:57.404 --> 00:23:58.901\n&gt;&gt; For everything that can be moved.\n\n506\n00:23:58.901 --> 00:24:02.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, so there we have move and\n\n507\n00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:07.660\nI can move this into the Daniel\nfolder of my tasks and there we go.\n\n508\n00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:11.911\nAnd I could also take from the Personal\ntask, I could go ahead and\n\n509\n00:24:11.911 --> 00:24:14.212\nmove that into the Daniel folder.\n\n510\n00:24:14.212 --> 00:24:18.430\nSo that's easy, and that's what I\nkept looking for in the contacts.\n\n511\n00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:21.642\nLike I said, if it's working for\nyour contacts, you're okay.\n\n512\n00:24:21.642 --> 00:24:26.935\nBut I at least wanted to show you that\nyou can go ahead and organize all of your\n\n513\n00:24:26.935 --> 00:24:32.230\ntasks, move them around, categorize them,\nput little charms on it.\n\n514\n00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.100\nAnd look at that,\nyou can even put reminders on them.\n\n515\n00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.430\nMy God,\nI totally didn't plan this by the way.\n\n516\n00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.820\n[LAUGH] I completely did not plan this.\n\n517\n00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.930\nI'm looking all around like there's\nother people besides just us.\n\n518\n00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:46.800\nBut I now have a reminder\nof my task to tell you,\n\n519\n00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:51.184\nthat we're one minute overdue for\nending the show.\n\n520\n00:24:51.184 --> 00:24:56.026\nI'm gonna dismiss this, I'm going to come\ninto here, and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n521\n00:24:56.026 --> 00:24:58.600\nmark this off as completed.\n\n522\n00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.973\nThere you go and now Daniel we are done.\n\n523\n00:25:01.973 --> 00:25:03.270\nSo we should end the show.\n\n524\n00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:05.723\n&gt;&gt; You seem like you're waiting for\nsome big finale.\n\n525\n00:25:05.723 --> 00:25:07.802\n[LAUGH] Because we're there.\n\n526\n00:25:07.802 --> 00:25:08.491\nIt's the end of the show.\n\n527\n00:25:08.491 --> 00:25:09.061\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Poof!\n\n528\n00:25:09.061 --> 00:25:09.915\n&gt;&gt; Vonne just

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:17.123\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:17.123 --> 00:00:20.897\nAnd in today's episodes, we're continuing\nour journey through Outlook on the web.\n\n5\n00:00:20.897 --> 00:00:25.315\nIn particular, we're gonna be exploring\ngroups in Outlook on the web.\n\n6\n00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:30.410\nAnd I say that with upward inflection\nbecause I don't know what they really are.\n\n7\n00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.012\nSo I'm here to learn, just like you are.\n\n8\n00:00:32.012 --> 00:00:36.524\nAnd luckily, we have the maestro\nof Outlook, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:36.524 --> 00:00:37.100\nHow are you today, Vonne?\n\n10\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.230\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n11\n00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.635\nI'm excited to gaggle together as a group.\n\n12\n00:00:41.635 --> 00:00:45.610\n[LAUGH] Yes, we were just talking\nabout this before the episode.\n\n13\n00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.700\nI'm thinking gaggle like geese.\n\n14\n00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.784\nAnd then we went through,\nwhat's a whale pod?\n\n15\n00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:55.995\n&gt;&gt; It's a whale pod,\na pride of lions, a flock of goats.\n\n16\n00:00:55.995 --> 00:00:56.653\nI don't know.\n\n17\n00:00:56.653 --> 00:00:58.045\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n18\n00:00:58.045 --> 00:00:59.886\nIt's a herd of goats, I don't know.\n\n19\n00:00:59.886 --> 00:01:01.322\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Those are fun.\n\n20\n00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:02.049\n&gt;&gt; I like flock of goats.\n\n21\n00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:03.699\nI think that's good.\n&gt;&gt; Flock of goats, for some reason,\n\n22\n00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:04.375\nthey have wings.\n\n23\n00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:07.108\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Look at those goats flocking\n\n24\n00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:07.900\neverywhere.\n\n25\n00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.825\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I love it.\n\n26\n00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:11.237\nWell, if we have some flying goats,\n\n27\n00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:14.118\nthey're probably gonna wanna stick\ntogether, wouldn't they, right?\n\n28\n00:01:14.118 --> 00:01:14.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they sure will.\n\n29\n00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.510\n&gt;&gt; And share resources like calendars and\n\n30\n00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.720\nmailboxes and contacts and\nall that kind of fun stuff.\n\n31\n00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.536\nWell, guess what,\nI'm describing groups in Outlook.\n\n32\n00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:28.488\nSo, let me go ahead and\ngive you a reference point to look for,\n\n33\n00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:32.838\nbecause Microsoft actually spells\nout what is a group pretty well.\n\n34\n00:01:32.838 --> 00:01:34.527\nSo why don't we jump on down in here?\n\n35\n00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:38.130\nAnd this link is in this show notes,\nso you guys have access to this.\n\n36\n00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.325\nSo, Learn about Office 365 Groups, service\ndeveloped with collaboration in mind.\n\n37\n00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:48.910\nI like that, cuz Microsoft has gotten\nreally good at how teams can collaborate\n\n38\n00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.682\nwith each other online through Office 365,\nthrough online subscriptions.\n\n39\n00:01:54.682 --> 00:01:59.249\nAnd when you think about a group of\npeople that work together, well,\n\n40\n00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:04.057\nthat's exactly what they're doing\nvirtually through these different\n\n41\n00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:08.724\nfeatures and services that you\nhave with your Office 365 account.\n\n42\n00:02:08.724 --> 00:02:12.202\nSo what you get, it says right here,\nyou go ahead and\n\n43\n00:02:12.202 --> 00:02:15.540\ncreate a group, and you have people in it.\n\n44\n00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.641\nAnd in that group, you get shared inboxes.\n\n45\n00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:23.931\nWow, so we all have the exact\nsame inbox that we can access.\n\n46\n00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:26.050\nYou get a shared calendar.\n\n47\n00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.540\nYou get a shared document library, so\nyou could share documents with each other.\n\n48\n00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.359\nYou get a OneNote.\n\n49\n00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.549\nThat's pretty awesome, so\nyou can take notes together.\n\n50\n00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.560\nYou get a whole website or\nan intranet-type site with SharePoint.\n\n51\n00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.340\nAnd you get access to Planner.\n\n52\n00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.130\nNow, this is just a really cool way for\nyou to go ahead and\n\n53\n00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.044\nkind of just compartmentalize yourself.\n\n54\n00:02:48.044 --> 00:02:50.205\nSo here's an example.\n\n55\n00:02:50.205 --> 00:02:52.091\nLet's say we're on a team.\n\n56\n00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:56.425\nSay it's me and you and\nWes and Ronnie, right?\n\n57\n00:02:56.425 --> 00:03:01.870\nWe're all on team Go Gators.\n\n58\n00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.403\nI have no idea what I'm,\n[LAUGH] I'm just making it up right now.\n\n59\n00:03:04.403 --> 00:03:10.753\nOur job is to create a whole marketing\nscheme for the fall football season.\n\n60\n00:03:10.753 --> 00:03:11.953\nHow about that, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:11.953 --> 00:03:14.865\nSo that's the scenario I'm\nmaking up right on the fly.\n\n62\n00:03:14.865 --> 00:03:18.070\n[LAUGH] And\nwe're gonna need to do meetings together.\n\n63\n00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.760\nWe're gonna need to have\ndifferent contacts together.\n\n64\n00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.490\nSo that would be something we could\ngo ahead and set up as a group.\n\n65\n00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.110\nAnd so we could have gators@itpro.tv.\n\n66\n00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.146\nOr I guess I should use officeprodemoco,\nshould I?\n\n67\n00:03:30.146 --> 00:03:33.610\ngators@officeprodemoco.com.\n\n68\n00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.456\nAnd so we have a kind of a catch-all email\nthat people are going to email us and\n\n69\n00:03:38.456 --> 00:03:40.518\nsay hey, I'm gonna take over.\n\n70\n00:03:40.518 --> 00:03:42.895\nMaybe I'm in the office that day,\nand I answer it.\n\n71\n00:03:42.895 --> 00:03:45.980\nBut you have access to\nthe exact same email.\n\n72\n00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.266\n&gt;&gt; This is actually\nkinda making sense now,\n\n73\n00:03:48.266 --> 00:03:52.920\ncuz I've seen these emails where you're\nlike, email and info at, blah blah blah.\n\n74\n00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.760\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm like, who's answering that?\n\n75\n00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.089\nBut it may be a group of people that\nhave a shared responsibility and\n\n76\n00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:02.510\nthus are a part of a,\nyou are the information group.\n\n77\n00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And for our example,\n\n78\n00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.820\nwe would be the organizers group,\nI suppose.\n\n79\n00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n80\n00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.442\nwe're Gators at, [LAUGH] I can't even\nremember who I work for right now.\n\n81\n00:04:12.442 --> 00:04:16.370\n[LAUGH] So yeah, so you can see that\nyou can create a shared identity and\n\n82\n00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.235\nhave all these resources,\nso it's pretty neat.\n\n83\n00:04:19.235 --> 00:04:23.639\nSo let's keep going down through some of\nthese references that we have in this\n\n84\n00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.636\nwebsite to where, all right,\nso what do we do here?\n\n85\n00:04:26.636 --> 00:04:31.724\nAnd you also have Yammer,\nwhich is kind of, it's almost like a chat.\n\n86\n00:04:31.724 --> 00:04:33.974\nIt's almost like an internal Facebook,\nif you wanna say,\n\n87\n00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:35.670\nwhich is kind of interesting.\n\n88\n00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.298\nWhat do I need to use for groups?\n\n89\n00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:41.590\nAnd you can see that it will have\nthese different types of plans.\n\n90\n00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.830\nSo you also have to make sure that your\nsubscription actually supports groups,\n\n91\n00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.820\njust to make sure that you know that.\n\n92\n00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.011\nAnd that's actually, also, some of\nthese other features like Yammer or\n\n93\n00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:55.611\nyour document library,\nyou gotta be just a little aware of it.\n\n94\n00:04:55.611 --> 00:04:59.145\nBut then you have private versus public.\n\n95\n00:04:59.145 --> 00:05:00.885\nWell, that kinda speaks for itself.\n\n96\n00:05:00.885 --> 00:05:04.265\nPublic, everybody can see and\nmaybe be able to join.\n\n97\n00:05:04.265 --> 00:05:07.225\nPrivate would be like, I don’t want\nother people to be able to see some\n\n98\n00:05:07.225 --> 00:05:09.805\nof the things that we're doing, because\nif you think about larger organization,\n\n99\n00:05:09.805 --> 00:05:11.955\nyou might have hundreds and\nhundreds of people.\n\n100\n00:05:11.955 --> 00:05:15.075\nYou don’t want all those hundreds\nof people to be able to see it, so\n\n101\n00:05:15.075 --> 00:05:16.475\nyou can have closed groups.\n\n102\n00:05:16.475 --> 00:05:18.290\nIt is also kind of like Facebook.\n\n103\n00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.464\nI know Facebook groups,\nyou can either have a public or\n\n104\n00:05:21.464 --> 00:05:24.856\na private type of group and\nhow you kinda get added into it.\n\n105\n00:05:24.856 --> 00:05:28.913\n&gt;&gt; And to some extent I think of that as,\nfiltering out the noise for\n\n106\n00:05:28.913 --> 00:05:34.400\nthe individuals who don't necessarily need\nto be part of whatever answering emails or\n\n107\n00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.920\nmaking schedules or what not.\n\n108\n00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.920\nI have these four people\nthat are in a group, and\n\n109\n00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.620\nthen those are the only four that get\nemails related to that particular topic.\n\n110\n00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.290\nSo there's some filtering built in.\n\n111\n00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.670\nIt's not necessarily all it is.\n\n112\n00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.280\nBut my mind kind of arranges that and\nwell,\n\n113\n00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.910\nI get emails about organizing\nthe Gators Fun Time Club.\n\n114\n00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.453\nWhereas maybe not everybody in their\nentire organization needs to do that\n\n115\n00:05:58.453 --> 00:06:00.711\nbecause they are not\norganizers of said thing.\n\n116\n00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:03.970\n&gt;&gt; Or even know that the group exists,\nthat kinda thing.\n\n117\n00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.920\nSo that's always a good\nthing to know about.\n\n118\n00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.056\nNow how do I manage it?\n\n119\n00:06:07.056 --> 00:06:10.226\nThe cool thing is they've\nactually made it really easy for\n\n120\n00:06:10.226 --> 00:06:13.078\nyou to be able to create a group,\nadd people into it.\n\n121\n00:06:13.078 --> 00:06:15.718\nAs soon as you do that,\nit goes ahead and proliferates and\n\n122\n00:06:15.718 --> 00:06:19.788\nmakes all the different things, like your\nshared calendar, your shared mailbox, and\n\n123\n00:06:19.788 --> 00:06:21.720\nyour contacts and everything like that.\n\n124\n00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.680\nSo it's actually pretty easy, okay?\n\n125\n00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.440\nSo why don't I show you how to do this?\n\n126\n00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.020\nWe've got, that's the local installation.\n\n127\n00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.089\nHow about we go to the online.\n\n128\n00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:33.455\n[LAUGH] It's just on the other tab.\n\n129\n00:06:33.455 --> 00:06:36.485\nSo I'm gonna come over\nhere to our other tab, and\n\n130\n00:06:36.485 --> 00:06:40.785\nthere is a group that's already created,\ncalled the reunion tour.\n\n131\n00:06:40.785 --> 00:06:44.365\nAnd if you've watched any of the Office,\nor the Outlook 2016 shows,\n\n132\n00:06:44.365 --> 00:06:47.150\nthey're there too,\nbecause that's where I made them.\n\n133\n00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.765\nSo we have our reunion tours.\n\n134\n00:06:48.765 --> 00:06:53.665\nThis is definitely local versus online,\nvery much the same.\n\n135\n00:06:53.665 --> 00:06:55.170\nThey're all in sync.\n\n136\n00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.620\nSo when I come down here to my groups,\nnotice I have the reunion tour,\n\n137\n00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.249\nyou can see over here on the right hand\nside there are three members in this\n\n138\n00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:03.284\nparticular group.\n\n139\n00:07:03.284 --> 00:07:06.530\nOkay, I have joined this.\n\n140\n00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.459\nIt is a public group here.\n\n141\n00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:13.160\nAnd then I have,\nthis is our own mailbox right here.\n\n142\n00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.362\nAnd that we all see this, so I can go\nahead and look at all these things.\n\n143\n00:07:18.362 --> 00:07:19.487\nI'm gonna go ahead and do a new one.\n\n144\n00:07:19.487 --> 00:07:26.560\nCuz you see right there, even the to\nis to: reunion tour@officeprodemo.com.\n\n145\n00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.320\nSo we're all going to get it.\n\n146\n00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.800\nSo if I wanted to email the group, and\nof course guess who's in the group,\n\n147\n00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.660\nall three people in OfficePro demo code.\n\n148\n00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.540\nSo we've got those different ones in\nhere and then I just go ahead and email.\n\n149\n00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.992\nAnd we can kinda keep,\n\n150\n00:07:41.992 --> 00:07:46.814\nit's almost our own closed conversations\nthat we have amongst our group.\n\n151\n00:07:46.814 --> 00:07:50.460\nNow if we kinda keep going across\nthe top notice we have Files.\n\n152\n00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.680\nI can go into the different files.\n\n153\n00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:58.650\nAnd now, this is different than\nmy my own OneDrive account.\n\n154\n00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:03.940\nJustin's OneDrive account is\ndifferent than his group OneDrive.\n\n155\n00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.180\nSo that's something that's\nkinda interesting right there,\n\n156\n00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.260\nwhere you can go to your different files,\n\n157\n00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.800\nthat's something that I'd already\nput into the file library.\n\n158\n00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.370\nNotice if you go over to the calendar,\nthis is our reunion calendar,\n\n159\n00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.060\nand everybody sees the same calendar.\n\n160\n00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.665\nAnd then you keep on going across, then\nif you have your access to your OneNote,\n\n161\n00:08:24.665 --> 00:08:27.235\nyour notebook that goes over into OneNote.\n\n162\n00:08:27.235 --> 00:08:29.170\nAnd this is where,\nI'm just kinda giving you an overview.\n\n163\n00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.840\nWe're not going into, well, then how\ndo you use OneNote, how to use Planner.\n\n164\n00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.959\nI'm just showing you you have these\ndifferent resources available to you,\n\n165\n00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:38.190\nas a member of a group.\n\n166\n00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:42.796\nSo you can see, at least I can see,\nthe benefits of having all of these\n\n167\n00:08:42.796 --> 00:08:47.256\ndifferent things compartmentalized\nfrom my daily, normal job.\n\n168\n00:08:47.256 --> 00:08:49.296\nThis is my team responsibilities,\n\n169\n00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:52.360\nand it's all right over there\nin a nice little group.\n\n170\n00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:57.275\nIt can be really, really handy for you to\nbe able to kind of determine what needs\n\n171\n00:08:57.275 --> 00:09:00.714\nto be done within that\nparticular group environment.\n\n172\n00:09:00.714 --> 00:09:04.510\nSo I just wanted to kinda throw\nthat out to you guys right there.\n\n173\n00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:10.313\nNow what if you were wanting\nto create your own group.\n\n174\n00:09:10.313 --> 00:09:13.365\nWell, in the group over here.\n\n175\n00:09:13.365 --> 00:09:14.785\nSo we come over there.\n\n176\n00:09:14.785 --> 00:09:18.725\nNotice that there's a little plus\nsign right there in our groups.\n\n177\n00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:22.015\nJust like if I was making a new\ncalendar or what have you.\n\n178\n00:09:22.015 --> 00:09:24.265\nSo if I go ahead and\nclick the plus sign over there,\n\n179\n00:09:24.265 --> 00:09:28.450\nnotice on the right hand side panel,\nyou can see where it says Create a Group.\n\n180\n00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.180\nAnd there's quite a few\ndifferent things in here.\n\n181\n00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.290\nWe have Create a Name,\nwhich of course we can name this.\n\n182\n00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.850\nYou add a description.\n\n183\n00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.590\nAnd then, if you see this is starting\nto get a little bit behind my head,\n\n184\n00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.970\nyou can see that we have\nsome privacy options here,\n\n185\n00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:43.500\nof where we have either it's public or\nprivate.\n\n186\n00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.755\nAnd then you have, over on here,\nwhat language that want to use.\n\n187\n00:09:47.755 --> 00:09:49.259\nI think we'll just stick with English for\nright now.\n\n188\n00:09:49.259 --> 00:09:54.716\nAnd then send copies of all group\nmessages and events to members' inboxes.\n\n189\n00:09:54.716 --> 00:10:00.060\nNow, that's a setting that you might or\nmay or may not wanna turn on,\n\n190\n00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.854\nbecause think about,\nif it's going into my regular inbox and\n\n191\n00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:09.418\nthen also to my group,\nthat might get a little confusing.\n\n192\n00:10:09.418 --> 00:10:15.150\nSo you wanna determine whether or not\nyou wanna have that of copies in both or\n\n193\n00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.390\njust send it to the one group right there.\n\n194\n00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.520\nSo I definitely wanted to point that\nout because that's kind of a big deal,\n\n195\n00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.600\ncuz you don't wanna have is like,\nI don't wanna have duplicate\n\n196\n00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.460\nthings in different places and\nget myself confused, because guess what.\n\n197\n00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.630\nIt happens a lot.\n\n198\n00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.458\nReally easily.\n\n199\n00:10:30.458 --> 00:10:31.640\nYou've all seen it.\n\n200\n00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.396\nWho am I?\nAm I Justin, am I Joey, am I Lance?\n\n201\n00:10:33.396 --> 00:10:34.230\nWhat am I?\n\n202\n00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.490\nSo we've got that going on.\n\n203\n00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.390\nThat's gonna be really good to\nmake sure that you don't wanna\n\n204\n00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.648\nkinda cross streams in a sense\n&gt;&gt; You should never cross\n\n205\n00:10:41.648 --> 00:10:42.282\nthe streams\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n206\n00:10:42.282 --> 00:10:43.952\n&gt;&gt; That's an important lesson in life.\n\n207\n00:10:43.952 --> 00:10:45.116\nNever cross the streams.\n\n208\n00:10:45.116 --> 00:10:45.937\n&gt;&gt; Never.\n\n209\n00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:49.174\n[LAUGH] So you can see that,\nif I went ahead and created it,\n\n210\n00:10:49.174 --> 00:10:52.830\nit would then just make the reunion tour,\njust like I have done.\n\n211\n00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.420\nI'm not gonna go through to the steps\nright now because it really is\n\n212\n00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.040\nthat simple.\n\n213\n00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.785\nYou just go ahead, [SOUND], there you go.\n\n214\n00:10:57.785 --> 00:11:02.520\nAnd then you go ahead and\nadd your members on the next screen.\n\n215\n00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.730\nAnd then you add who you wanna have there.\n\n216\n00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.560\nAnd then that's what\nyou do with your group.\n\n217\n00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.410\nAnd that's,\nhonestly that's as easier as it can get.\n\n218\n00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:14.280\nI just wanted you to be aware of\nsome of the things that you can do,\n\n219\n00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.770\nbut just remember you do have\nto go back to your mail section,\n\n220\n00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.630\nif you're in like the calendar or\nthe contacts like I was just in,\n\n221\n00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:27.470\nI wanted to get back over to mail so\nI can get the options across the top for\n\n222\n00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:31.640\nthe different things that\nI can do within my group.\n\n223\n00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:36.554\nAnd that's where also,\nif I needed to add members into a group,\n\n224\n00:11:36.554 --> 00:11:40.289\nlet's say we have Joey,\nLance, and JT in here.\n\n225\n00:11:40.289 --> 00:11:43.859\nMaybe we wanted to add Chris or\nsomebody else into our group,\n\n226\n00:11:43.859 --> 00:11:45.680\nyou could go ahead and do that.\n\n227\n00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.660\nYou could also add it to your favorites\nover here in your folder pane, and\n\n228\n00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.412\nthat's where you can kinda\ncontrol some of that.\n\n229\n00:11:52.412 --> 00:11:57.224\nNow, the other one is, say you're in\na group and maybe they've added you\n\n230\n00:11:57.224 --> 00:12:01.610\ninto the group, but you really\ndon't need to be part of the group.\n\n231\n00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.530\nYou can always unsubscribe from the email.\n\n232\n00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:09.740\nIt's kind of like in Facebook where\nyou just hide the one person.\n\n233\n00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.450\nYou're not unfriending them or anything.\n\n234\n00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:15.150\nYou're just gonna hide their posts\nfrom your feed, cuz we do that.\n\n235\n00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.610\nSo that's one of those things where you're\njust gonna unsubscribe from the email.\n\n236\n00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.650\nI don't wanna get the email.\n\n237\n00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.200\nOr you can leave the group all together.\n\n238\n00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.340\nI do not wanna be part\nof this group anymore,\n\n239\n00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.010\nso you could go ahead and leave that.\n\n240\n00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.788\nAnd so\nthat's what something that you can do.\n\n241\n00:12:30.788 --> 00:12:32.409\nBut there's, like I said,\n\n242\n00:12:32.409 --> 00:12:36.140\na lot of cool resources that you\ncan implement with being a group.\n\n243\n00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.400\nAnd it's really easy to set up.\n\n244\n00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.330\n&gt;&gt; I have a quick question\nabout leaving the group.\n\n245\n00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.940\nAre the remaining group\nmembers notified about you\n\n246\n00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.890\nremoving yourself from the group?\n\n247\n00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:49.680\nEssentially, is the group then notified\nabout a member leaving said group.\n\n248\n00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.360\nThat way if we're doing this in\nsome kind of business organization,\n\n249\n00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.450\nI need to know that.\n\n250\n00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.957\nMaybe they did it unintentionally,\nwhoopsy-daisy, or it was a voluntary\n\n251\n00:12:57.957 --> 00:13:02.007\nthing, and they're like, well, we can't\nrely on this individual to make sure we\n\n252\n00:13:02.007 --> 00:13:05.494\nhave the appropriate amount of corn\nnuggets or something, I don't know.\n\n253\n00:13:05.494 --> 00:13:09.711\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You know that's a really\ngood question because that's\n\n254\n00:13:09.711 --> 00:13:14.720\nwhere I wanna head Justin out of\nthe group, came over here to Joey.\n\n255\n00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:19.630\nAnd it looks like there wasn't any\nreal email that went out to Joey\n\n256\n00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:20.560\nthat Justin had left.\n\n257\n00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:25.730\nIt's kind of like, I'm relating\neverything to Facebook right now, but\n\n258\n00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.990\nyou don't really get a notification\nthat somebody unfriended you.\n\n259\n00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:34.028\nYou just kind of have to go in and see\nI had five friends and now I have four.\n\n260\n00:13:34.028 --> 00:13:35.360\n[LAUGH] Those kinds of things.\n\n261\n00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.300\nYou're number one Dan.\n\n262\n00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.420\nYou can see here as Joey,\nit just shows two members.\n\n263\n00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.920\nIt doesn't show that third one.\n\n264\n00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.230\nSo that would be your biggest indication\nthat somebody has left your group.\n\n265\n00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:50.500\nIt doesn't look like you're getting\nany notifications from that.\n\n266\n00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.850\nI'm not sure if you could set\nthat at the ending level.\n\n267\n00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.560\nBut it looks like right now,\nas an end user,\n\n268\n00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.630\nwithout configuring anything, that, no,\n\n269\n00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:02.840\nyou don't get any alarms that go off if\nsomebody has decided to leave your group.\n\n270\n00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.064\nYou just gonna have to call them\non the phone, something like that.\n\n271\n00:14:06.064 --> 00:14:08.323\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is crazy.\n\n272\n00:14:08.323 --> 00:14:09.471\nCalling people on the phone?\n\n273\n00:14:09.471 --> 00:14:10.272\nI never would have thought.\n\n274\n00:14:10.272 --> 00:14:14.027\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, talking to people in person, no.\n\n275\n00:14:14.027 --> 00:14:16.630\n[LAUGH] So,\ncuz why would you wanna talk in person?\n\n276\n00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:17.779\nYou've got everything in the group.\n\n277\n00:14:17.779 --> 00:14:21.766\nYou shared notes, you got files, you could\ngo ahead and chat, you can go back and\n\n278\n00:14:21.766 --> 00:14:24.008\nforth through all of\nyour different things.\n\n279\n00:14:24.008 --> 00:14:28.392\nSo, it's like I don't need\nto necessarily do that.\n\n280\n00:14:28.392 --> 00:14:32.755\nBut, of course, you should always, this\nis the whole idea about communicating and\n\n281\n00:14:32.755 --> 00:14:36.140\nbeing able to collaborate\ntogether as a group.\n\n282\n00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:41.500\nAnd so that's where you could go ahead and\nwhere you'd want to have these starts up.\n\n283\n00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:46.600\nAnd notice that right here,\nI just wanna open up from Joey right here,\n\n284\n00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:51.320\nyou're getting this kind of like\na conversation that goes on right here.\n\n285\n00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.540\nAnd you can go back through, and\nyou can respond, and you can like them.\n\n286\n00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.544\nThat's another thing we've\ntalked about with the likes,\n\n287\n00:14:58.544 --> 00:14:59.916\nwhere it's giving you notifications.\n\n288\n00:14:59.916 --> 00:15:03.755\nSo you can give those\nlittle kinda thumbs up, and\n\n289\n00:15:03.755 --> 00:15:09.225\njust nonverbal if you wanna say,\nwell I guess this is all nonverbal.\n\n290\n00:15:09.225 --> 00:15:12.114\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I guess kind of a non-in-depth kind of\n\n291\n00:15:12.114 --> 00:15:13.240\nquick feedback.\n\n292\n00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.900\nBe like, what do you think about this?\n\n293\n00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.544\nThumbs up, cool, I can actually-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n294\n00:15:16.544 --> 00:15:20.447\n&gt;&gt; Take action on said item without having\nto, and that's what I was thinking about,\n\n295\n00:15:20.447 --> 00:15:22.528\nthose corn nuggets you were talking about.\n\n296\n00:15:22.528 --> 00:15:24.180\nI don't know, I don't know.\n\n297\n00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.570\nDo people like those or not?\n\n298\n00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.240\nIt's thumbs up, cool, good.\n\n299\n00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's good.\n\n300\n00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:29.470\nI really like groups.\n\n301\n00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.940\nI think that can really help\nyou to work in a collaborative\n\n302\n00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.420\nenvironment if you need to\nhave project-specific things.\n\n303\n00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:40.000\nAnd the nice thing is once it's done, you\ncan just go ahead and delete the group.\n\n304\n00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.220\nAnd then you don't have to worry about\nthat or you can leave the group.\n\n305\n00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.290\nYou do have to be the one that\nwould need to be the organizer.\n\n306\n00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.270\nAnd this is where notice where it says,\nEdit Group.\n\n307\n00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.230\nThat's because, and I was thinking about\nit, who's the one who set this one up?\n\n308\n00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:55.210\nYeah, it was Joey.\n\n309\n00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:56.280\nSo you can see right over here,\n\n310\n00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.180\nthere's a couple things behind\nmy head to look at too.\n\n311\n00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.850\nJustin, so\nnotice that I do have that send copies,\n\n312\n00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.307\nthat's something I might wanna turn off.\n\n313\n00:16:04.307 --> 00:16:09.990\nAnd that's as the organizer,\nJoey is the creator of this group.\n\n314\n00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.670\nHe would be the one to be\nable to turn this on or off.\n\n315\n00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.357\nAnd I don't know if you noticed that JT,\n\n316\n00:16:15.357 --> 00:16:18.369\nhe didn't have the option\nto edit the group.\n\n317\n00:16:18.369 --> 00:16:19.620\nHe had the option to leave.\n\n318\n00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:24.170\nSo let's switch over Lance just so\nyou can see his whole thing.\n\n319\n00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:28.040\nLet's go over to the group.\n\n320\n00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.360\nAnd we're going to scroll on down.\n\n321\n00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.309\nLet's go ahead and collapse this.\n\n322\n00:16:32.309 --> 00:16:33.460\nWell, guess what?\n\n323\n00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.185\nI don't have any groups.\n\n324\n00:16:34.185 --> 00:16:37.736\nSo [LAUGH] I thought he was part of one.\n\n325\n00:16:37.736 --> 00:16:39.290\nYou know why?\n\n326\n00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.880\nHey, Justin,\ndo you know why this isn't working?\n\n327\n00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:42.980\nI'll give you a quiz.\n\n328\n00:16:44.048 --> 00:16:48.863\n&gt;&gt; I think that Lance is\nin the wrong delegated\n\n329\n00:16:48.863 --> 00:16:50.294\ninbox-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n330\n00:16:50.294 --> 00:16:52.630\n&gt;&gt; It's not actually his,\nit's instead for JT's.\n\n331\n00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.946\n&gt;&gt; You're so, look at that, see?\n\n332\n00:16:54.946 --> 00:16:56.330\nGood, I had hope.\n\n333\n00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:57.130\nYou've got it right.\n\n334\n00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:59.210\nOkay, because that was\nkinda throwing me off too.\n\n335\n00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.960\nI was like, where's this, where am I?\n\n336\n00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.183\nHey, remember that whole thing that I said\nI can get myself confused really easily?\n\n337\n00:17:05.183 --> 00:17:05.952\nI just did it again.\n\n338\n00:17:05.952 --> 00:17:09.510\nSo, [LAUGH] if I come back\ndown under here, there we go.\n\n339\n00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:14.363\nAs Lance, cuz Lance was walking on JT's\nemail, and we had actually filmed that\n\n340\n00:17:14.363 --> 00:17:18.620\nepisode before that one just to\nmake sure we all know about that.\n\n341\n00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.843\nThere's my groups, and\nif I come over here to the reunion tour,\n\n342\n00:17:22.843 --> 00:17:27.430\nfor Lance, notice that I've got these\ndifferent options right in here, and\n\n343\n00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.890\nhe does not have the option\nto edit the group.\n\n344\n00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:35.150\nThat was what I was trying to get around,\nkind of taking a couple of loops in there.\n\n345\n00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:37.508\nBut he does not have\nthe option to edit the group.\n\n346\n00:17:37.508 --> 00:17:43.910\nYou have to be the organizer as Joey to\ncome back in to do the different things.\n\n347\n00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:48.050\nAnd behind my head, just to show you,\nif you're done with your group,\n\n348\n00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:52.110\nask another kind of coming full circle\nback to us, like, delete the group.\n\n349\n00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.480\nOkay, I had to remind myself who made it.\n\n350\n00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.540\nJoey would be the one that would be able\nto delete the group or edit anything for\n\n351\n00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.830\nthe group that he created.\n\n352\n00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.314\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\ndiscard those changes, so\n\n353\n00:18:05.314 --> 00:18:07.691\nagain this is just kinda\nan introduction to groups.\n\n354\n00:18:07.691 --> 00:18:12.640\nJust letting you know what resources\nare there, how you can kinda control it.\n\n355\n00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.644\nIt really is easy.\n\n356\n00:18:13.644 --> 00:18:15.045\nI don't like to use those words.\n\n357\n00:18:15.045 --> 00:18:16.130\nIt's like, you can do it.\n\n358\n00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.560\nIt's a cinch.\nIt's like, yeah, but\n\n359\n00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.490\nyou do it all the time.\n\n360\n00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:19.417\nYou know exactly where it's at.\n\n361\n00:18:19.417 --> 00:18:21.580\nBut, it really is that simple.\n\n362\n00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.320\nCreate it.\n\n363\n00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.730\nUse the resources and people.\n\n364\n00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.230\nGo ahead and\nanswer the emails just like you would and\n\n365\n00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.700\nkeep that nice compartmentalized group.\n\n366\n00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:34.296\nAnd you can be your own gaggle pot\nof flying goats and go ahead and\n\n367\n00:18:34.296 --> 00:18:35.952\nhave fun on that farm.\n\n368\n00:18:35.952 --> 00:18:38.682\nSo, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, I'm definitely gonna have\n\n369\n00:18:38.682 --> 00:18:41.340\na hard time getting the image of\nflock of goats out of my head.\n\n370\n00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.925\nDoes sound like a good band name, though.\n\n371\n00:18:42.925 --> 00:18:44.437\nBut more importantly,\n\n372\n00:18:44.437 --> 00:18:49.360\nI started out this episode with no idea\nwhat groups were in Outlook on the web.\n\n373\n00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.828\nBut luckily, you've definitely\nilluminated that very fact for me.\n\n374\n00:18:52.828 --> 00:18:55.930\nCuz I can see the distinct value\nregardless of how small or\n\n375\n00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.280\nhow large your organization may be.\n\n376\n00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.170\nOr organization may be filtering out.\n\n377\n00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:03.021\nOr maybe even just saying, hey,\nus two are gonna work on this.\n\n378\n00:19:03.021 --> 00:19:06.140\nWe're gonna organize it\nin the separate inbox.\n\n379\n00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.060\nSo definitely, thank you for that.\n\n380\n00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:12.030\nBut it just looks like we are running\nlow on time for this respective episode.\n\n381\n00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:16.400\nSo definitely join us back as we continue\nour trip through Outlook on the web.\n\n382\n00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.500\nBut for now, signing off for OfficePro.TV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n383\n00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.360\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n384\n00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.393\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n",
