00:00:33.398\ntalk about the topics that we are going\nto be covering in this series.\n\n11\n00:00:33.398 --> 00:00:36.089\nWe're gonna start off with,\nwell, an introduction.\n\n12\n00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:38.590\nGonna be going over some terminology.\n\n13\n00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.533\nWhat is an email server,\nwhat is a pop, and what's an iMap?\n\n14\n00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:45.232\nAnd all of different things that you\nmight be hearing when people talk\n\n15\n00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:46.198\nabout emailing.\n\n16\n00:00:46.198 --> 00:00:48.736\nAnd especially some of those\nIT professionals that you\n\n17\n00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:50.820\nmight be working with in your help desk.\n\n18\n00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.064\nSo just gets you a little bit more\nfamiliar with the area of emailing,\n\n19\n00:00:55.064 --> 00:00:59.835\nan exchange servers, and Office 365 and\nfree accounts in Outlook.com.\n\n20\n00:00:59.835 --> 00:01:04.763\nSo we're also gonna be talking about\nthe interface of your mail in your\n\n21\n00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:07.890\nbrowser because this is out on the web.\n\n22\n00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.070\nSo we will be taking\nsome time to go ahead and\n\n23\n00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.779\ncompare and contrast between having\nthe Outlook in your web interface.\n\n24\n00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:20.090\nAnd then also your local ones with this\nshow is targeted to Outlook on the web.\n\n25\n00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.177\nI will also gonna go ahead and talk about\nyour account set-up which honestly,\n\n26\n00:01:23.177 --> 00:01:26.187\nthey're really isn't much set-up to\ndo because you're already online.\n\n27\n00:01:26.187 --> 00:01:28.290\nAnd so, that's kinda of the nice thing.\n\n28\n00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.780\nWe're also going to talk about\nsome emailing, all right.\n\n29\n00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.598\nThat's probably a lot with Outlook is\nknown for so we're going to send and\n\n30\n00:01:34.598 --> 00:01:35.740\nreceive emails.\n\n31\n00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.652\nWe're also gonna be\nformatting our messages.\n\n32\n00:01:37.652 --> 00:01:42.293\nWe're gonna go over how to organize and\ncustomize your Outlook environment and\n\n33\n00:01:42.293 --> 00:01:45.488\nhow to be best effective and\nefficient for your needs.\n\n34\n00:01:45.488 --> 00:01:48.170\nWe'll also talk about, ooh,\ngood old junk mail, right.\n\n35\n00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.436\nThat can always be a pain in our sides.\n\n36\n00:01:49.436 --> 00:01:51.761\nWe'll hopefully we'll try\nto alleviate that and\n\n37\n00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:55.930\nbe able to show you all the different\noptions you have through junk mail.\n\n38\n00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.767\nAnd we'll go over rules and\nautomation that can be really,\n\n39\n00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:00.708\nreally handy to making more efficient.\n\n40\n00:02:00.708 --> 00:02:02.470\nWe're also gonna talk about people.\n\n41\n00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.130\nNow if you're from back in the day,\nwhat are people?\n\n42\n00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.598\nIt's your contacts,\nthey're really the same thing.\n\n43\n00:02:07.598 --> 00:02:11.640\nWe'll be creating new contacts,\nwe'll be editing contacts.\n\n44\n00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.174\nAnd all the different things that you\ncan do within that particular area of\n\n45\n00:02:15.174 --> 00:02:16.145\nOutlook on the web.\n\n46\n00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:20.220\nAnd doing some comparing and\ncontrasting in that area, specifically,\n\n47\n00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.898\nbecause there are some decent amount of\ndifference between the local installation\n\n48\n00:02:24.898 --> 00:02:28.129\nthe online version that you\nhave in Outlook, on the web.\n\n49\n00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.910\nWe'll also talk about\nour wonderful calendar.\n\n50\n00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.303\nKeeping ourselves organized by creating\nappointments, creating meetings.\n\n51\n00:02:34.303 --> 00:02:38.491\nAnd then also being able to share\ncalendars within your organization.\n\n52\n00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:43.920\nAlso outside of your organization\nby going ahead and publishing it.\n\n53\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.480\nAnd then we have our other topic,\n\n54\n00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.995\nthat's where we're going\nto talk about some tasks.\n\n55\n00:02:47.995 --> 00:02:50.852\nAnd what you have on local installation\nwhich are known as notes and\n\n56\n00:02:50.852 --> 00:02:52.650\nwhere they are on the outlook for the web.\n\n57\n00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.243\nAnd any other miscellaneous items\nthat we would like to go ahead and\n\n58\n00:02:57.243 --> 00:03:00.943\ninclude we'll go ahead and\nput it in that other area.\n\n59\n00:03:00.943 --> 00:03:02.930\nNow who was this for?\n\n60\n00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.686\nIt's all Office users.\n\n61\n00:03:04.686 --> 00:03:09.403\nThis is Office with a capital O\nmean that you are using Office,\n\n62\n00:03:09.403 --> 00:03:11.560\nthe suite of application.\n\n63\n00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.218\nYou have either an Outlook, or\nsorry an Office 365 subscription,\n\n64\n00:03:15.218 --> 00:03:19.128\nyou have an account that you have paid\nfor, and have a paid version of that.\n\n65\n00:03:19.128 --> 00:03:26.240\nBut this show also covers the outlook.com,\nyour free version of using Outlook.\n\n66\n00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.359\nSo that's why we have Office,\nit doesn't mean, Office with a capital.\n\n67\n00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.072\nIt does not mean you have to\nbe In an office environment or\n\n68\n00:03:33.072 --> 00:03:38.760\nin a large organization, you can be in\nan organization of two, one, or 20000.\n\n69\n00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.160\nSo it doesn't matter what size of\nthe office that you physically obtain or\n\n70\n00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.570\nwhere you actually work from and\nuse Outlook.\n\n71\n00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.350\nBut you can see that I do\nhave using Outlook online.\n\n72\n00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.359\nSo this is where your gonna be\nusing the web interface and\n\n73\n00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.966\nnot the local installation.\n\n74\n00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:58.314\nIf you have access to it, that's great but\n\n75\n00:03:58.314 --> 00:04:02.434\nI do take it from the standpoint that\nyou're only gonna be using it online.\n\n76\n00:04:02.434 --> 00:04:04.367\nAnd yes I will compare and contrast but\n\n77\n00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:07.520\nthat's why we have this entire\nseries where out gone the web.\n\n78\n00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.495\nAnd this is for a basic user, I would\nsay taking from like some basic skills\n\n79\n00:04:12.495 --> 00:04:17.550\nup into an intermediate level of\nusing this particular product.\n\n80\n00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.664\nNow what do you need to\nknow before we get started?\n\n81\n00:04:19.664 --> 00:04:24.244\nHaving some Windows basics with your\noperating system is going to always be\n\n82\n00:04:24.244 --> 00:04:24.760\nhandy.\n\n83\n00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.205\nSo know where your start menu,\nyou know where your browsers,\n\n84\n00:04:27.205 --> 00:04:29.240\ndo you know what browser\nyou're going to be using.\n\n85\n00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.083\nAre you using Chrome,\nare you using Firefox?\n\n86\n00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:33.040\nAre using Edge?\n\n87\n00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.797\nAnd I actually kinda cover quite\na few of them, kinda jump back and\n\n88\n00:04:36.797 --> 00:04:41.388\nforth in between them with the different\nusers within this particular series.\n\n89\n00:04:41.388 --> 00:04:44.640\nWe're gonna be using our good\nold Justin and Joey and Lance.\n\n90\n00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.194\nIf you haven't watched any of\nmy other series, well get ready,\n\n91\n00:04:47.194 --> 00:04:48.150\nthey are coming at you.\n\n92\n00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.620\nAnd so that's where we're\ngoing to be using those.\n\n93\n00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.085\nSo having some familiarity\nwith some other Office\n\n94\n00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:58.710\nproducts is always a helpful leg up for\nyou but it's not required.\n\n95\n00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.068\nIf you've used Excel before,\nor you have Word,\n\n96\n00:05:01.068 --> 00:05:04.070\nyou know a little bit about\nOffice products, that's great.\n\n97\n00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.044\nOr maybe you've been using Google, or\nyou've been using Yahoo for your mail and\n\n98\n00:05:08.044 --> 00:05:10.682\nnow you're kind of familiar\nwith those interfaces.\n\n99\n00:05:10.682 --> 00:05:14.953\nThat might go ahead and give you a little\nbit of something to start with when you\n\n100\n00:05:14.953 --> 00:05:16.680\nstart using Outlook on Web.\n\n101\n00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.118\nBut again, not required.\n\n102\n00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:20.260\nI start from the very beginning and go on.\n\n103\n00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.825\nExtra things to always keep in mind,\nthere are always other options.\n\n104\n00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:30.327\nMaybe not as many of them on-line\nbecause of course this is a,\n\n105\n00:05:30.327 --> 00:05:36.730\nI would call almost like a slimmed down\nversion of what is capable within Outlook.\n\n106\n00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.535\nBecause it is on the web and\n\n107\n00:05:38.535 --> 00:05:42.322\nyou are limited to how\nthe browser is going to respond.\n\n108\n00:05:42.322 --> 00:05:45.475\nSo sometimes right clicking\nis not always going to work\n\n109\n00:05:45.475 --> 00:05:48.980\nin your low section of products,\nthat's always an option.\n\n110\n00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.165\nThere's usually like six or\nseven ways to do something.\n\n111\n00:05:51.165 --> 00:05:53.960\nMaybe here you might only have two or\nthree.\n\n112\n00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.676\nSo do keep that in mind, but\nthere could always be other ways of\n\n113\n00:05:57.676 --> 00:06:02.550\ngetting to perform different tasks, that\nI'm showing you the way I go about it.\n\n114\n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.530\nYou might have some other ways\nthat you might be able to do it.\n\n115\n00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.730\nAnd I did throw in here the browsers.\n\n116\n00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.372\nWhile there might not be too many\noptions it could make a difference of\n\n117\n00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:17.309\nwhether you're using Outlook\nthrough the Edge browser.\n\n118\n00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:22.304\nA Microsoft product, versus let's\nsay Chrome, or even if you're on\n\n119\n00:06:22.304 --> 00:06:27.234\na Mac with a Safari browser,\nthat could Have something to do with it.\n\n120\n00:06:27.234 --> 00:06:28.887\nIf you do any type of searching, and\n\n121\n00:06:28.887 --> 00:06:31.840\nyou can see that's one of my\nbullet points right there.\n\n122\n00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.465\nSearching for the answers, there's\nalways something that's gonna come up or\n\n123\n00:06:35.465 --> 00:06:36.774\nlike, why is it doing that?\n\n124\n00:06:36.774 --> 00:06:38.930\nYou go out and you search for the web.\n\n125\n00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.394\nAnd a lot of those forums that\ncome from the Microsoft Help,\n\n126\n00:06:41.394 --> 00:06:43.278\nthey'll be like what\nbrowser are you using?\n\n127\n00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:47.856\nThey're always gonna ask the people who\nare asking questions in those forums,\n\n128\n00:06:47.856 --> 00:06:51.970\ntell me what browser you're using\nbecause it could make a difference.\n\n129\n00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.691\nMaybe there are certain features that\nare not available within that particular\n\n130\n00:06:55.691 --> 00:06:57.757\nversion of the browser that you're using.\n\n131\n00:06:57.757 --> 00:07:02.190\nAnd another one that's always happening,\nupdates.\n\n132\n00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.404\nUpdates can throw things\nall out of whack sometimes.\n\n133\n00:07:04.404 --> 00:07:08.372\nThat's actually happened to me right in\nthe middle of one of my episodes where\n\n134\n00:07:08.372 --> 00:07:12.291\nthere's an Office update and\nit's completely reconfigured everything.\n\n135\n00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:15.000\nSo it could happen, it will happen.\n\n136\n00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.372\nAnd it might have some changes in what\nyou're looking at at the time that you're\n\n137\n00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:22.720\nwatching this as opposed to\nthe time that I did the tutorial.\n\n138\n00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.283\nAnd of course anytime we had any major\nchanges, we will always go ahead and\n\n139\n00:07:27.283 --> 00:07:29.720\nupdate those episodes for you.\n\n140\n00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.695\nAnd of course everybody has a different\nreason for using Outlook, and\n\n141\n00:07:32.695 --> 00:07:35.230\nyou might not use it the same\nway that somebody else uses it.\n\n142\n00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.887\nBut that's okay to eat its own,\nand so I wanna try and\n\n143\n00:07:37.887 --> 00:07:40.020\ngive you all the different
