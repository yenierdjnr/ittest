00:00:08.064\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.064 --> 00:00:11.803\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:13.135\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:13.135 --> 00:00:17.580\nchoosing ITPRO.TV empowering\nthe world through engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.030\nI'm your host Zach Memos and\nthis is PC maintenance.\n\n8\n00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.850\nWe're going to be doing HDD\nreplacement and installation.\n\n9\n00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.089\nAnd we matched our IT expert,\nWes Bryan, to help us out.\n\n10\n00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.368\nWes, thanks for doing this.\n\n11\n00:00:29.368 --> 00:00:31.883\n[CROSSTALK] Appreciate it,\nlot of hard work this guy right here.\n\n12\n00:00:31.883 --> 00:00:33.900\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, this is gonna be a fun one.\n\n13\n00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.860\nI tell you what if you've\never been around a computer,\n\n14\n00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.040\nwhen it comes to components it's not\na matter of if they're gonna fail,\n\n15\n00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.110\nit's always a matter of\nwhen they're gonna fail.\n\n16\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.580\nAnd that's what we're gonna\nlook at in this episode.\n\n17\n00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.090\nIs because there are times when maybe you\npush the power under your computer and\n\n18\n00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.290\nit doesn't boot up, right?\n\n19\n00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.600\nOr maybe you get some low-resolution text\nthat's letting you know there's a problem.\n\n20\n00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.430\nBut worst case scenario, you aren't\ngetting into your operating system.\n\n21\n00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.220\nSo it is important to understand\nhow to replace a hard drive.\n\n22\n00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.860\nSo when we talk about PC maintenance,\n\n23\n00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.530\nthat's what we're gonna be\nlooking at in this episode.\n\n24\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.660\nNow, I do want you to keep in mind that\npart of PC maintenance that can help\n\n25\n00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.600\nsave you a lot of headache, is to make\nsure you're running backup software.\n\n26\n00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.590\nNow, on other episodes within pc\nmaintenance, we show you how to\n\n27\n00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.635\nrun even just a basic system backups so\nthat if if your hard drive does fail, and\n\n28\n00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:25.545\nagain, not if but\nwhen your hard drive fails,\n\n29\n00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:28.995\nyou'll be able to restore that operating\nsystem to an earlier point in time.\n\n30\n00:01:28.995 --> 00:01:32.955\nBut when we're looking at in this\nepisode is just how do I get that\n\n31\n00:01:32.955 --> 00:01:37.535\nhard drive replaced and we'll be looking\nat some of the different components.\n\n32\n00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:40.265\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, what are some of the things\nwe need to consider when replacing\n\n33\n00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:41.610\nthe hard drive?\n\n34\n00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes, Zach, that's a great question.\n\n35\n00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.110\nCuz there are all different types\nof drive technologies out there.\n\n36\n00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.850\nThe big thing is just making\nsure the standard that you have.\n\n37\n00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.100\nAgain performance is something\nthat we have to consider too.\n\n38\n00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.130\nSolid state drive versus\ntraditional mechanical drive.\n\n39\n00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.866\nIf your hard drive does fail, let's go\nahead and see what that looks like.\n\n40\n00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:01.079\nI'll tell you what Zach, can you go\nahead and help me out and push power.\n\n41\n00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:01.817\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n42\n00:02:01.817 --> 00:02:04.340\n&gt;&gt; And we will see what that looks like.\n\n43\n00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.040\nSo when this computer boots up, one of the\nthings that you're gonna notice right away\n\n44\n00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.770\nis that, after it gets through it's BIOS\nscreen which we should see it here is\n\n45\n00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.250\na second, you'll see the ASUS, this just\nhappens to be an ASUS motherboard here.\n\n46\n00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.560\nAnd notice what it's telling us.\n\n47\n00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.130\nReboot and select a proper boot device.\n\n48\n00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.340\nNow, I know that I have\na hard drive in this machine.\n\n49\n00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.340\nSo what we've done here is we've got\nsome kind of hard drive failure, so\n\n50\n00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.450\nwhat we're gonna need to do is we're\ngonna need to replace it, right.\n\n51\n00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.280\nWell, in order to do that, one of the\nbiggest things, another consideration that\n\n52\n00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.760\nyou have to just keep in mind is\nwhat does the motherboard support?\n\n53\n00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.900\nAll right, well in order to see\nwhat the motherboard supports,\n\n54\n00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.610\nwe actually have to look\nat what the motherboard is.\n\n55\n00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.140\nNow, if you have one of these computers\nthat you bought from a manufacturer,\n\n56\n00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.290\nyou can just look with the manufacturer's\nmanual specifications.\n\n57\n00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.480\nIf it happens to be like\nthe one I have here,\n\n58\n00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.680\nthis is one that was actually\nbuilt piece by piece.\n\n59\n00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.810\nSo it will be something a little more\nspecific, and what I need to do,\n\n60\n00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.960\nI need to find out what is\nthe motherboard I have.\n\n61\n00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.040\nAll right, so let's go ahead and do that.\n\n62\n00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.170\nWe'll take a look into this computer here.\n\n63\n00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.560\nAnd one of the first things\nthat we have to do in order to\n\n64\n00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.440\nessentially see what motherboard we have,\nwe have to take off the case.\n\n65\n00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.190\nSo, we've got a computer right here and\n\n66\n00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.480\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna go\nahead and we're gonna do just that.\n\n67\n00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.640\nNow, understand that in\ntaking off this case I am not\n\n68\n00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.450\nby any means touching anything in here.\n\n69\n00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.030\nWe're gonna power that down when we\nactually do the replacement, but\n\n70\n00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.940\nwe'll take off the case cover.\n\n71\n00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.087\nAnd you'll notice right down in here\nI actually have what board this is.\n\n72\n00:03:36.087 --> 00:03:37.908\nThis happens to be the Asus.\n\n73\n00:03:37.908 --> 00:03:43.710\nIt's the MSA97 revision, I believe R2.\n\n74\n00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.870\nSo I take that information, and\nthen what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna come\n\n75\n00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.340\nback over to my computer and we have to\ngo, we have to do some shopping, right?\n\n76\n00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.140\nSo one of the things we have to do,\nis I went ahead and\n\n77\n00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.110\ngot Zach's credit card\nwhile he wasn't looking.\n\n78\n00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.660\n&gt;&gt; He always does that.\n\n79\n00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.540\n&gt;&gt; Zach, sorry about that.\n\n80\n00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.520\n&gt;&gt; Every time.\n\n81\n00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.130\n&gt;&gt; And we're going to go shopping here,\nso let's go ahead and do that.\n\n82\n00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.512\nOn my screen here, I've already gone ahead\nand I've gone out to a place like newegg.\n\n83\n00:04:05.512 --> 00:04:08.090\nYou can go to any reseller you want.\n\n84\n00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.510\nAgain, understand, we're not really\nmaking any money off this, but\n\n85\n00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.440\nthey've got a good inventory here.\n\n86\n00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.220\nAnd this is actually\nthe motherboard that I want.\n\n87\n00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.620\nSo what I need to do is I need to\nfind what are the specifications.\n\n88\n00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.994\nAnd you can do this,\nagain depending on what website you're on.\n\n89\n00:04:23.994 --> 00:04:28.878\nOne of the things I like is I just look at\nthe specifications right here and I need\n\n90\n00:04:28.878 --> 00:04:33.540\nto find out what is the drive technology\nthat is supported on this machine?\n\n91\n00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.018\nYou can see right here storage devices,\nright?\n\n92\n00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:39.735\nI can see that this is a SATA\n6 drive right the earlier\n\n93\n00:04:39.735 --> 00:04:42.112\nspecification would be SATA 3.\n\n94\n00:04:42.112 --> 00:04:46.049\nKeep in mind by the way, you can put\na SATA 6 drive and a SATA 3 port on your\n\n95\n00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:50.134\nmotherboard, it's just gonna throttle\nitself down to the slower speed.\n\n96\n00:04:50.134 --> 00:04:54.070\nSo that is a consideration and what I\nmean by that is you will find, in fact,\n\n97\n00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.005\nlet me go ahead and show you this, a\ncouple of good pictures on here and let me\n\n98\n00:04:58.005 --> 00:05:02.217\ngo ahead and bring up the picture of\nthe motherboard, and we'll kinda zoom in.\n\n99\n00:05:02.217 --> 00:05:05.370\nAnd one of the things that you'll\nnotice here, and where are they?\n\n100\n00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.910\nThere they are.\n\n101\n00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.090\nYou notice how we have these\nSATA 6 GB per second, right?\n\n102\n00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.738\nThat lets me know that these\nare the SATA 6 standard, right?\n\n103\n00:05:14.738 --> 00:05:15.774\nIt's the newest standard.\n\n104\n00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:16.710\nThat's the big thing.\n\n105\n00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.900\nIf you're looking for performance,\nyou want the newest standard.\n\n106\n00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.894\nIf you wanna learn more about\nthe standards and specifications,\n\n107\n00:05:21.894 --> 00:05:23.425\ncheck out Comp T and A plus shows.\n\n108\n00:05:23.425 --> 00:05:24.299\nAnd we go a-\n&gt;&gt; Um-hm.\n\n109\n00:05:24.299 --> 00:05:27.670\n&gt;&gt; Little bit more in depth because you\nhave to be able to know this technology in\n\n110\n00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.500\norder to support-\n&gt;&gt; It's a great show, too, by the way.\n\n111\n00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.460\n&gt;&gt; For the help desk.\n\n112\n00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.580\nAll right.\n\n113\n00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.000\nSo we know what we need, right?\n\n114\n00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.495\nNow the next portion of this would just\nbe to buy the appropriate drive, right?\n\n115\n00:05:37.495 --> 00:05:40.275\nYou have to, again, keep in mind.\n\n116\n00:05:40.275 --> 00:05:43.055\nDo you want, do you want size?\n\n117\n00:05:43.055 --> 00:05:46.395\nCause capacity is sometimes\nvery important for people.\n\n118\n00:05:46.395 --> 00:05:49.085\nSo that might be a reason\nto go with an HDD, right,\n\n119\n00:05:49.085 --> 00:05:53.175\nthe hard dark drive versus\na solid disk drive,\n\n120\n00:05:53.175 --> 00:05:58.170\nright SSD, the solid state drive, excuse\nme, solid state drive is the one that.\n\n121\n00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.130\nCapacity use, the bigger the capacity,\nthe more expensive it is but\n\n122\n00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.440\nthe better performance so gotta kinda\nweigh cost and performance here.\n\n123\n00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.480\nWhat we are gonna do is\nwe are gonna go ahead,\n\n124\n00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.150\nand we gonna replace the fail drive,\nIts a little drive its not that big\n\n125\n00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.090\ndefinitely but it's an A standard,\nit's only 160 gig.\n\n126\n00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.790\nAnd what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna replace it\n\n127\n00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.420\nwith a three terabyte Seagate drive.\n\n128\n00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.195\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe are going to see what that looks like.\n\n129\n00:06:26.727 --> 00:06:28.968\nAll right Zach, so\none of the first things that we do is,\n\n130\n00:06:28.968 --> 00:06:30.940\nfirst we're gonna protect ourselves,\nright?\n\n131\n00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.860\nWe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ndisconnect the power connector here\n\n132\n00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.150\nfrom the power supply, and what I like to\ndo is I like to press the power button and\n\n133\n00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.470\njust hold it in a little bit.\n\n134\n00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.580\nAnd it kind of gets rid of any excess\nelectricity that might be remaining\n\n135\n00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.580\njust to protect yourself.\n\n136\n00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.100\nAnd then the second part of this is\nactually protecting the components\n\n137\n00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.460\nwith inside of.\n\n138\n00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.540\nThe system unit, or the case if you will.\n\n139\n00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.200\nAnd we're gonna use our proper\nESD prevention techniques.\n\n140\n00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.800\nIf you're not familiar with\nelectrostatic discharge or\n\n141\n00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.601\nESD prevention techniques, then hop\nover to ITVProTV's course library.\n\n142\n00:07:03.601 --> 00:07:05.320\nBecause we do have COMPTIA and\n\n143\n00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.187\nA+ courses that will go a lot more\ninto electro static discharge.\n\n144\n00:07:09.187 --> 00:07:10.118\n&gt;&gt; And you should hop over there.\n\n145\n00:07:10.118 --> 00:07:11.470\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n146\n00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.200\nLet's go ahead.\n\n147\n00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.710\nThe next thing we're going to do is\nwe're going to take the hard drive out.\n\n148\n00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.470\nBecause we're going to replace it.\n\n149\n00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.830\nKeep in mind that sometimes you have\nother components that are within\n\n150\n00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.740\nthe case that might make\nthis a little bit difficult.\n\n151\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.910\nFor instance,\nyou can see this pretty sizable Radian,\n\n152\n00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.930\nor ASUS, if you will, graphics card here.\n\n153\n00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.516\nThank goodness that I can actually\ntake this out of here without having\n\n154\n00:07:34.516 --> 00:07:35.131\nto do that.\n\n155\n00:07:35.131 --> 00:07:38.852\nBut again, your case might not\nallow you that ability, but\n\n156\n00:07:38.852 --> 00:07:43.840\nI'm going to go ahead and what I'm going\nto do is I'm going to pull the main power\n\n157\n00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.073\nconnector off to the side here, and\n\n158\n00:07:46.073 --> 00:07:51.080\nthe very first thing I'm going to do is\nI'm going to disconnect the data cable.\n\n159\n00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.460\nNow, I'm going to keep the data cable\nin the position that it is, down here,\n\n160\n00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.830\nif we can zoom in, you'll see there's\na series of ports right here.\n\n161\n00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.220\nVery good and notice that I've got this.\n\n162\n00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.390\nThis data cable is actually in Port 1.\n\n163\n00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.421\nAll right,\nit differs a little bit on motherboards.\n\n164\n00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:11.343\nIt might be Port 0, then Port 1, 2, and 3.\n\n165\n00:08:11.343 --> 00:08:14.826\nThis one goes actually Port 1,\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\n166\n00:08:14.826 --> 00:08:17.107\nSometimes that affects\nwhether it'll boot up or\n\n167\n00:08:17.107 --> 00:08:19.910\nnot, once you got your\noperating system installed.\n\n168\n00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.190\nIn this case it really doesn't matter.\n\n169\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.010\nThis motherboard just\nknows to search the ports.\n\n170\n00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:29.990\nThe serial ATA ports for the master boot\nrecord or GPT when it is booting up.\n\n171\n00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.080\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead, and I'm gonna\nleave that in that first position there so\n\n172\n00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.160\nthat when we replace the drive and\ngo to install our operating system.\n\n173\n00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.590\nIt's already in the right position.\n\n174\n00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:42.630\nNext thing I'm gonna do, you'll see\nhere is I'm gonna disconnect the power\n\n175\n00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:47.490\nconnector from the back of the drive\nas well if I can get that out so\n\n176\n00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.270\nyou guys can see that out there.\n\n177\n00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.734\nSo I'm disconnecting the power\nconnector as well and\n\n178\n00:08:51.734 --> 00:08:53.606\nI'm gonna kinda leave that to the side.\n\n179\n00:08:53.606 --> 00:08:58.507\nNow, you'll notice that for the most part,\nthis case is almost tooless, except for\n\n180\n00:08:58.507 --> 00:09:00.292\ninstalling the motherboard.\n\n181\n00:09:00.292 --> 00:09:03.263\nIt really depends on your case so\nfor instance,\n\n182\n00:09:03.263 --> 00:09:07.140\nthese sprage just kinda lift up and\nwe can't tighten it down.\n\n183\n00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:12.110\nI kind of just can't tightened it really\nbut you can actually move it right\n\n184\n00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:17.081\nto the side, and you'll see that\nthe hard drive will actually slide right\n\n185\n00:09:17.081 --> 00:09:22.680\nout the back and noticed that the graphics\ncar is kinda in the way here.\n\n186\n00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.010\nWe do have enough space if\nyou'll check that out to\n\n187\n00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:29.330\npull this hard drive\nright out below the case.\n\n188\n00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.410\nNow, what you can see is\nwe have these little clips.\n\n189\n00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.290\nAnd what they do is kinda like guides,\nthey go up these rails and\n\n190\n00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:41.140\nit makes it very easy to uninstall\na drive and then reinstall a drive here.\n\n191\n00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.310\nAnd what we just need to do,\nis we need to make sure that we take these\n\n192\n00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.830\noff of the failed hard drive, right?\n\n193\n00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.200\nOr if, would this could be an upgrade,\nright?\n\n194\n00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.820\nIn this case, we might have a drive\nhere that hasn't really failed,\n\n195\n00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.965\nmaybe it's just the fact that, it's\nbecause this is an old 160 gig drive, and\n\n196\n00:09:59.965 --> 00:10:03.975\nby today's standards, that's so small.\n\n197\n00:10:03.975 --> 00:10:07.805\nAnd then what we need to do is we're\ngonna take the three terabyte drive and\n\n198\n00:10:07.805 --> 00:10:10.673\nI'll show you how I know that by the way,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n199\n00:10:10.673 --> 00:10:14.925\nOnce you've specked out your drive,\nyou can see we have 3,000 gigabytes and\n\n200\n00:10:14.925 --> 00:10:16.575\nagain, desktop HDD.\n\n201\n00:10:16.575 --> 00:10:18.718\nYou can see Seagate here so.\n\n202\n00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:21.125\nThis is the newer drive, and\n\n203\n00:10:21.125 --> 00:10:26.952\nwhat we need to do is we just need\nto replace these little easy remove.\n\n204\n00:10:26.952 --> 00:10:30.889\nAt sometimes, they might be clipped so I'm\ngoing to say clip here, accidentally but\n\n205\n00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:34.910\nthese are literally are just screws\nthat have little rubber washers on them.\n\n206\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.650\nThat help for the guide rails, right.\n\n207\n00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.810\nAnd guide that drive back in place.\n\n208\n00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:40.790\nIt's really really nice.\n\n209\n00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.970\nIt used to be,\nyou used to have screwdrivers and\n\n210\n00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.422\nstuff that you'd have to use,\nand even before that,\n\n211\n00:10:45.422 --> 00:10:49.347\nwhen you're talking about the old Parallel\nATA drives, they were a nightmare to work\n\n212\n00:10:49.347 --> 00:10:52.808\nwith especially with the big old ribbon\ncables that you used to have to use.\n\n213\n00:10:52.808 --> 00:10:54.705\nIt used to be a nightmare\nto get these in and out.\n\n214\n00:10:54.705 --> 00:10:59.495\nToday, not so bad,\nwe put our little guides here in place and\n\n215\n00:10:59.495 --> 00:11:02.655\nwhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna take that drive.\n\n216\n00:11:02.655 --> 00:11:06.935\nAnd we're just going to basically line\nit back up here, you can see, and\n\n217\n00:11:06.935 --> 00:11:10.880\nyou might have to move that\nback up to unlock it here.\n\n218\n00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.220\nAnd they just kind of guide\nthemselves right back into place.\n\n219\n00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.610\nThat's one of the great things\nabout having a drive like this.\n\n220\n00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.070\nNow, notice something here.\n\n221\n00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:22.400\nI did push that down and it wont let\nit go all the way back in place,\n\n222\n00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:27.560\nso make sure that you seat that in\nthe right location and seat it firmly so\n\n223\n00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.250\nthat you don't have to worry about\nthe drive rattling around in there.\n\n224\n00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:35.340\nBecause the mechanical drives can move a\ngood bit especially if you talk about high\n\n225\n00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.630\nRPM drives.\n\n226\n00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.940\nThen what we're gonna do here,\nI know it's hard to see,\n\n227\n00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.400\nI'm gonna get my hand out of there is I'm\njust gonna replace this power connector.\n\n228\n00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.780\nAnd that is replaced.\n\n229\n00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.680\nAnd then the next thing that we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna take the data cable and\n\n230\n00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.120\nwe're gonna go ahead, and the good thing\nabout the serial ATA specification is\n\n231\n00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.760\nyou will notice that there's\nthese little blades, right?\n\n232\n00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.960\nSo it's kinda difficult\nto get them in wrong.\n\n233\n00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:07.460\nThey line up fairly easy and\nit really is just as simple as that.\n\n234\n00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.170\nWe've replaced the hard drive and\nit didn't take too much.\n\n235\n00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:13.060\nNow, one of the last things that\nwe're going to do before we\n\n236\n00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.980\nget into installing our operating system\nis I'm just going to go ahead and\n\n237\n00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.130\ndisconnect the ESD wrist strap, right?\n\n238\n00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.140\nAnd then it's just a matter of replacing-\n&gt;&gt; Safety first, always.\n\n239\n00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:22.940\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.\n\n240\n00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.250\nWe're gonna replace the case, and then in\nthe next part of this, what we're gonna\n\n241\n00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.520\nshow you is, now that you've replaced your\ndrive, if you were to turn around and\n\n242\n00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.430\nreboot this computer,\nit would give you the same error, right?\n\n243\n00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:36.300\nIt would say, you need to have\nan appropriate boot device.\n\n244\n00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.418\nWhy is that?\n\n245\n00:12:37.418 --> 00:12:39.130\nWell, we don't have\nan operating system on that.\n\n246\n00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:43.156\nSo in the second part of this, what we're\ngoing to show you is how to obtain your\n\n247\n00:12:43.156 --> 00:12:46.999\noperating system, make a bootable usb\ndrive, throw it in the computer and\n\n248\n00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:48.970\ninstall your operating system.\n\n249\n00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.830\nSo, fairly straight forward, right?\n\n250\n00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:52.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, great job.\n\n251\n00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.720\n&gt;&gt; Not do difficult, thank you there, so\nlet's go ahead, one of the last things\n\n252\n00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.710\nthat we're going to do is we're going to\njust replace the cover, so I can go ahead,\n\n253\n00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:02.780\nZach if you can help me out here\n&gt;&gt; This is fairly easy and again,\n\n254\n00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.120\nit's just matter of replacing down.\n\n255\n00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.300\nYou can see we're just putting the case\nback on here and that's it, right?\n\n256\n00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.820\nSo pretty straight forward,\nnot too difficult.\n\n257\n00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:17.500\nSo just make sure that when it comes down\nto it and when we you do replace your hard\n\n258\n00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.470\ndrive, just pay attention to what\nthe motherboard manufacturer,\n\n259\n00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:25.090\nthe specifications of the motherboard.\n\n260\n00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:29.921\nSo you know which of the standards\nthat it is that you have to use or\n\n261\n00:13:29.921 --> 00:13:33.150\npurchase when you replace the hard drive.\n\n262\n00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.571\nThe other thing to keep in mind too,\nremember safety.\n\n263\n00:13:36.571 --> 00:13:40.172\nYou want to disconnect any power from\nthe machine before you get in there and\n\n264\n00:13:40.172 --> 00:13:41.780\nyou start working with it.\n\n265\n00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.240\nThe other thing too is, I know that\nsome people use them, some people don't,\n\n266\n00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.170\nbut also make sure that you're using your\nelectrostatic discharge wrist wraps or\n\n267\n00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.730\ndoing self grounding techniques, just by\ntouching the inside of the case because\n\n268\n00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:56.780\nyou certainly don't want to try to\nreplace a damaged component, and\n\n269\n00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.310\nthen damage additional components\nwhen you're replacing them.\n\n270\n00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:00.191\n&gt;&gt; Didn't he do a wonderful job?\n\n271\n00:14:00.191 --> 00:14:05.032\nhe made it look so easy, and this has been\nHDD replacement, and installation, and\n\n272\n00:14:05.032 --> 00:14:06.500\nby the way this part one.\n\n273\n00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.986\nPart two, we do the operating system, so\nyou wanna make sure you watch that, and\n\n274\n00:14:09.986 --> 00:14:12.617\nin fact watch everything in the series,\na PC maintainance.\n\n275\n00:14:12.617 --> 00:14:15.994\nAs Wes mentioned earlier go to our\ncourse library, hundreds of videos, and\n\n276\n00:14:15.994 --> 00:14:18.190\nthey're all designed to do one thing.\n\n277\n00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.528\nHelp you go further.\n\n278\n00:14:19.528 --> 00:14:22.042\nHey, tell everybody you\nknow about ITProTV.\n\n279\n00:14:22.042 --> 00:14:23.179\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n280\n00:14:23.179 --> 00:14:24.720\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n281\n00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.403\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n282\n00:14:25.403 --> 00:14:26.562\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n283\n00:14:28.290 -->
