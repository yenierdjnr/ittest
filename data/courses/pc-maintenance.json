00:00:08.064\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.064 --> 00:00:11.803\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:13.135\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:13.135 --> 00:00:17.580\nchoosing ITPRO.TV empowering\nthe world through engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.030\nI'm your host Zach Memos and\nthis is PC maintenance.\n\n8\n00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.850\nWe're going to be doing HDD\nreplacement and installation.\n\n9\n00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.089\nAnd we matched our IT expert,\nWes Bryan, to help us out.\n\n10\n00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.368\nWes, thanks for doing this.\n\n11\n00:00:29.368 --> 00:00:31.883\n[CROSSTALK] Appreciate it,\nlot of hard work this guy right here.\n\n12\n00:00:31.883 --> 00:00:33.900\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, this is gonna be a fun one.\n\n13\n00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.860\nI tell you what if you've\never been around a computer,\n\n14\n00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.040\nwhen it comes to components it's not\na matter of if they're gonna fail,\n\n15\n00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.110\nit's always a matter of\nwhen they're gonna fail.\n\n16\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.580\nAnd that's what we're gonna\nlook at in this episode.\n\n17\n00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.090\nIs because there are times when maybe you\npush the power under your computer and\n\n18\n00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.290\nit doesn't boot up, right?\n\n19\n00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.600\nOr maybe you get some low-resolution text\nthat's letting you know there's a problem.\n\n20\n00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.430\nBut worst case scenario, you aren't\ngetting into your operating system.\n\n21\n00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.220\nSo it is important to understand\nhow to replace a hard drive.\n\n22\n00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.860\nSo when we talk about PC maintenance,\n\n23\n00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.530\nthat's what we're gonna be\nlooking at in this episode.\n\n24\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.660\nNow, I do want you to keep in mind that\npart of PC maintenance that can help\n\n25\n00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.600\nsave you a lot of headache, is to make\nsure you're running backup software.\n\n26\n00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.590\nNow, on other episodes within pc\nmaintenance, we show you how to\n\n27\n00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.635\nrun even just a basic system backups so\nthat if if your hard drive does fail, and\n\n28\n00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:25.545\nagain, not if but\nwhen your hard drive fails,\n\n29\n00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:28.995\nyou'll be able to restore that operating\nsystem to an earlier point in time.\n\n30\n00:01:28.995 --> 00:01:32.955\nBut when we're looking at in this\nepisode is just how do I get that\n\n31\n00:01:32.955 --> 00:01:37.535\nhard drive replaced and we'll be looking\nat some of the different components.\n\n32\n00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:40.265\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, what are some of the things\nwe need to consider when replacing\n\n33\n00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:41.610\nthe hard drive?\n\n34\n00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes, Zach, that's a great question.\n\n35\n00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.110\nCuz there are all different types\nof drive technologies out there.\n\n36\n00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.850\nThe big thing is just making\nsure the standard that you have.\n\n37\n00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.100\nAgain performance is something\nthat we have to consider too.\n\n38\n00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.130\nSolid state drive versus\ntraditional mechanical drive.\n\n39\n00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.866\nIf your hard drive does fail, let's go\nahead and see what that looks like.\n\n40\n00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:01.079\nI'll tell you what Zach, can you go\nahead and help me out and push power.\n\n41\n00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:01.817\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n42\n00:02:01.817 --> 00:02:04.340\n&gt;&gt; And we will see what that looks like.\n\n43\n00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.040\nSo when this computer boots up, one of the\nthings that you're gonna notice right away\n\n44\n00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.770\nis that, after it gets through it's BIOS\nscreen which we should see it here is\n\n45\n00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.250\na second, you'll see the ASUS, this just\nhappens to be an ASUS motherboard here.\n\n46\n00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.560\nAnd notice what it's telling us.\n\n47\n00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.130\nReboot and select a proper boot device.\n\n48\n00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.340\nNow, I know that I have\na hard drive in this machine.\n\n49\n00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.340\nSo what we've done here is we've got\nsome kind of hard drive failure, so\n\n50\n00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.450\nwhat we're gonna need to do is we're\ngonna need to replace it, right.\n\n51\n00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.280\nWell, in order to do that, one of the\nbiggest things, another consideration that\n\n52\n00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.760\nyou have to just keep in mind is\nwhat does the motherboard support?\n\n53\n00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.900\nAll right, well in order to see\nwhat the motherboard supports,\n\n54\n00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.610\nwe actually have to look\nat what the motherboard is.\n\n55\n00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.140\nNow, if you have one of these computers\nthat you bought from a manufacturer,\n\n56\n00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.290\nyou can just look with the manufacturer's\nmanual specifications.\n\n57\n00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.480\nIf it happens to be like\nthe one I have here,\n\n58\n00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.680\nthis is one that was actually\nbuilt piece by piece.\n\n59\n00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.810\nSo it will be something a little more\nspecific, and what I need to do,\n\n60\n00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.960\nI need to find out what is\nthe motherboard I have.\n\n61\n00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.040\nAll right, so let's go ahead and do that.\n\n62\n00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.170\nWe'll take a look into this computer here.\n\n63\n00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.560\nAnd one of the first things\nthat we have to do in order to\n\n64\n00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.440\nessentially see what motherboard we have,\nwe have to take off the case.\n\n65\n00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.190\nSo, we've got a computer right here and\n\n66\n00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.480\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna go\nahead and we're gonna do just that.\n\n67\n00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.640\nNow, understand that in\ntaking off this case I am not\n\n68\n00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.450\nby any means touching anything in here.\n\n69\n00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.030\nWe're gonna power that down when we\nactually do the replacement, but\n\n70\n00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.940\nwe'll take off the case cover.\n\n71\n00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.087\nAnd you'll notice right down in here\nI actually have what board this is.\n\n72\n00:03:36.087 --> 00:03:37.908\nThis happens to be the Asus.\n\n73\n00:03:37.908 --> 00:03:43.710\nIt's the MSA97 revision, I believe R2.\n\n74\n00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.870\nSo I take that information, and\nthen what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna come\n\n75\n00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.340\nback over to my computer and we have to\ngo, we have to do some shopping, right?\n\n76\n00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.140\nSo one of the things we have to do,\nis I went ahead and\n\n77\n00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.110\ngot Zach's credit card\nwhile he wasn't looking.\n\n78\n00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.660\n&gt;&gt; He always does that.\n\n79\n00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.540\n&gt;&gt; Zach, sorry about that.\n\n80\n00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.520\n&gt;&gt; Every time.\n\n81\n00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.130\n&gt;&gt; And we're going to go shopping here,\nso let's go ahead and do that.\n\n82\n00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.512\nOn my screen here, I've already gone ahead\nand I've gone out to a place like newegg.\n\n83\n00:04:05.512 --> 00:04:08.090\nYou can go to any reseller you want.\n\n84\n00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.510\nAgain, understand, we're not really\nmaking any money off this, but\n\n85\n00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.440\nthey've got a good inventory here.\n\n86\n00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.220\nAnd this is actually\nthe motherboard that I want.\n\n87\n00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.620\nSo what I need to do is I need to\nfind what are the specifications.\n\n88\n00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.994\nAnd you can do this,\nagain depending on what website you're on.\n\n89\n00:04:23.994 --> 00:04:28.878\nOne of the things I like is I just look at\nthe specifications right here and I need\n\n90\n00:04:28.878 --> 00:04:33.540\nto find out what is the drive technology\nthat is supported on this machine?\n\n91\n00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.018\nYou can see right here storage devices,\nright?\n\n92\n00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:39.735\nI can see that this is a SATA\n6 drive right the earlier\n\n93\n00:04:39.735 --> 00:04:42.112\nspecification would be SATA 3.\n\n94\n00:04:42.112 --> 00:04:46.049\nKeep in mind by the way, you can put\na SATA 6 drive and a SATA 3 port on your\n\n95\n00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:50.134\nmotherboard, it's just gonna throttle\nitself down to the slower speed.\n\n96\n00:04:50.134 --> 00:04:54.070\nSo that is a consideration and what I\nmean by that is you will find, in fact,\n\n97\n00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.005\nlet me go ahead and show you this, a\ncouple of good pictures on here and let me\n\n98\n00:04:58.005 --> 00:05:02.217\ngo ahead and bring up the picture of\nthe motherboard, and we'll kinda zoom in.\n\n99\n00:05:02.217 --> 00:05:05.370\nAnd one of the things that you'll\nnotice here, and where are they?\n\n100\n00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.910\nThere they are.\n\n101\n00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.090\nYou notice how we have these\nSATA 6 GB per second, right?\n\n102\n00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.738\nThat lets me know that these\nare the SATA 6 standard, right?\n\n103\n00:05:14.738 --> 00:05:15.774\nIt's the newest standard.\n\n104\n00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:16.710\nThat's the big thing.\n\n105\n00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.900\nIf you're looking for performance,\nyou want the newest standard.\n\n106\n00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.894\nIf you wanna learn more about\nthe standards and specifications,\n\n107\n00:05:21.894 --> 00:05:23.425\ncheck out Comp T and A plus shows.\n\n108\n00:05:23.425 --> 00:05:24.299\nAnd we go a-\n&gt;&gt; Um-hm.\n\n109\n00:05:24.299 --> 00:05:27.670\n&gt;&gt; Little bit more in depth because you\nhave to be able to know this technology in\n\n110\n00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.500\norder to support-\n&gt;&gt; It's a great show, too, by the way.\n\n111\n00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.460\n&gt;&gt; For the help desk.\n\n112\n00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.580\nAll right.\n\n113\n00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.000\nSo we know what we need, right?\n\n114\n00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.495\nNow the next portion of this would just\nbe to buy the appropriate drive, right?\n\n115\n00:05:37.495 --> 00:05:40.275\nYou have to, again, keep in mind.\n\n116\n00:05:40.275 --> 00:05:43.055\nDo you want, do you want size?\n\n117\n00:05:43.055 --> 00:05:46.395\nCause capacity is sometimes\nvery important for people.\n\n118\n00:05:46.395 --> 00:05:49.085\nSo that might be a reason\nto go with an HDD, right,\n\n119\n00:05:49.085 --> 00:05:53.175\nthe hard dark drive versus\na solid disk drive,\n\n120\n00:05:53.175 --> 00:05:58.170\nright SSD, the solid state drive, excuse\nme, solid state drive is the one that.\n\n121\n00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.130\nCapacity use, the bigger the capacity,\nthe more expensive it is but\n\n122\n00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.440\nthe better performance so gotta kinda\nweigh cost and performance here.\n\n123\n00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.480\nWhat we are gonna do is\nwe are gonna go ahead,\n\n124\n00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.150\nand we gonna replace the fail drive,\nIts a little drive its not that big\n\n125\n00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.090\ndefinitely but it's an A standard,\nit's only 160 gig.\n\n126\n00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.790\nAnd what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna replace it\n\n127\n00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.420\nwith a three terabyte Seagate drive.\n\n128\n00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.195\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe are going to see what that looks like.\n\n129\n00:06:26.727 --> 00:06:28.968\nAll right Zach, so\none of the first things that we do is,\n\n130\n00:06:28.968 --> 00:06:30.940\nfirst we're gonna protect ourselves,\nright?\n\n131\n00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.860\nWe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ndisconnect the power connector here\n\n132\n00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.150\nfrom the power supply, and what I like to\ndo is I like to press the power button and\n\n133\n00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.470\njust hold it in a little bit.\n\n134\n00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.580\nAnd it kind of gets rid of any excess\nelectricity that might be remaining\n\n135\n00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.580\njust to protect yourself.\n\n136\n00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.100\nAnd then the second part of this is\nactually protecting the components\n\n137\n00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.460\nwith inside of.\n\n138\n00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.540\nThe system unit, or the case if you will.\n\n139\n00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.200\nAnd we're gonna use our proper\nESD prevention techniques.\n\n140\n00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.800\nIf you're not familiar with\nelectrostatic discharge or\n\n141\n00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.601\nESD prevention techniques, then hop\nover to ITVProTV's course library.\n\n142\n00:07:03.601 --> 00:07:05.320\nBecause we do have COMPTIA and\n\n143\n00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.187\nA+ courses that will go a lot more\ninto electro static discharge.\n\n144\n00:07:09.187 --> 00:07:10.118\n&gt;&gt; And you should hop over there.\n\n145\n00:07:10.118 --> 00:07:11.470\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n146\n00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.200\nLet's go ahead.\n\n147\n00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.710\nThe next thing we're going to do is\nwe're going to take the hard drive out.\n\n148\n00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.470\nBecause we're going to replace it.\n\n149\n00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.830\nKeep in mind that sometimes you have\nother components that are within\n\n150\n00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.740\nthe case that might make\nthis a little bit difficult.\n\n151\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.910\nFor instance,\nyou can see this pretty sizable Radian,\n\n152\n00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.930\nor ASUS, if you will, graphics card here.\n\n153\n00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.516\nThank goodness that I can actually\ntake this out of here without having\n\n154\n00:07:34.516 --> 00:07:35.131\nto do that.\n\n155\n00:07:35.131 --> 00:07:38.852\nBut again, your case might not\nallow you that ability, but\n\n156\n00:07:38.852 --> 00:07:43.840\nI'm going to go ahead and what I'm going\nto do is I'm going to pull the main power\n\n157\n00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.073\nconnector off to the side here, and\n\n158\n00:07:46.073 --> 00:07:51.080\nthe very first thing I'm going to do is\nI'm going to disconnect the data cable.\n\n159\n00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.460\nNow, I'm going to keep the data cable\nin the position that it is, down here,\n\n160\n00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.830\nif we can zoom in, you'll see there's\na series of ports right here.\n\n161\n00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.220\nVery good and notice that I've got this.\n\n162\n00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.390\nThis data cable is actually in Port 1.\n\n163\n00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.421\nAll right,\nit differs a little bit on motherboards.\n\n164\n00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:11.343\nIt might be Port 0, then Port 1, 2, and 3.\n\n165\n00:08:11.343 --> 00:08:14.826\nThis one goes actually Port 1,\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\n166\n00:08:14.826 --> 00:08:17.107\nSometimes that affects\nwhether it'll boot up or\n\n167\n00:08:17.107 --> 00:08:19.910\nnot, once you got your\noperating system installed.\n\n168\n00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.190\nIn this case it really doesn't matter.\n\n169\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.010\nThis motherboard just\nknows to search the ports.\n\n170\n00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:29.990\nThe serial ATA ports for the master boot\nrecord or GPT when it is booting up.\n\n171\n00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.080\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead, and I'm gonna\nleave that in that first position there so\n\n172\n00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.160\nthat when we replace the drive and\ngo to install our operating system.\n\n173\n00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.590\nIt's already in the right position.\n\n174\n00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:42.630\nNext thing I'm gonna do, you'll see\nhere is I'm gonna disconnect the power\n\n175\n00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:47.490\nconnector from the back of the drive\nas well if I can get that out so\n\n176\n00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.270\nyou guys can see that out there.\n\n177\n00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.734\nSo I'm disconnecting the power\nconnector as well and\n\n178\n00:08:51.734 --> 00:08:53.606\nI'm gonna kinda leave that to the side.\n\n179\n00:08:53.606 --> 00:08:58.507\nNow, you'll notice that for the most part,\nthis case is almost tooless, except for\n\n180\n00:08:58.507 --> 00:09:00.292\ninstalling the motherboard.\n\n181\n00:09:00.292 --> 00:09:03.263\nIt really depends on your case so\nfor instance,\n\n182\n00:09:03.263 --> 00:09:07.140\nthese sprage just kinda lift up and\nwe can't tighten it down.\n\n183\n00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:12.110\nI kind of just can't tightened it really\nbut you can actually move it right\n\n184\n00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:17.081\nto the side, and you'll see that\nthe hard drive will actually slide right\n\n185\n00:09:17.081 --> 00:09:22.680\nout the back and noticed that the graphics\ncar is kinda in the way here.\n\n186\n00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.010\nWe do have enough space if\nyou'll check that out to\n\n187\n00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:29.330\npull this hard drive\nright out below the case.\n\n188\n00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.410\nNow, what you can see is\nwe have these little clips.\n\n189\n00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.290\nAnd what they do is kinda like guides,\nthey go up these rails and\n\n190\n00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:41.140\nit makes it very easy to uninstall\na drive and then reinstall a drive here.\n\n191\n00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.310\nAnd what we just need to do,\nis we need to make sure that we take these\n\n192\n00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.830\noff of the failed hard drive, right?\n\n193\n00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.200\nOr if, would this could be an upgrade,\nright?\n\n194\n00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.820\nIn this case, we might have a drive\nhere that hasn't really failed,\n\n195\n00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.965\nmaybe it's just the fact that, it's\nbecause this is an old 160 gig drive, and\n\n196\n00:09:59.965 --> 00:10:03.975\nby today's standards, that's so small.\n\n197\n00:10:03.975 --> 00:10:07.805\nAnd then what we need to do is we're\ngonna take the three terabyte drive and\n\n198\n00:10:07.805 --> 00:10:10.673\nI'll show you how I know that by the way,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n199\n00:10:10.673 --> 00:10:14.925\nOnce you've specked out your drive,\nyou can see we have 3,000 gigabytes and\n\n200\n00:10:14.925 --> 00:10:16.575\nagain, desktop HDD.\n\n201\n00:10:16.575 --> 00:10:18.718\nYou can see Seagate here so.\n\n202\n00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:21.125\nThis is the newer drive, and\n\n203\n00:10:21.125 --> 00:10:26.952\nwhat we need to do is we just need\nto replace these little easy remove.\n\n204\n00:10:26.952 --> 00:10:30.889\nAt sometimes, they might be clipped so I'm\ngoing to say clip here, accidentally but\n\n205\n00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:34.910\nthese are literally are just screws\nthat have little rubber washers on them.\n\n206\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.650\nThat help for the guide rails, right.\n\n207\n00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.810\nAnd guide that drive back in place.\n\n208\n00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:40.790\nIt's really really nice.\n\n209\n00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.970\nIt used to be,\nyou used to have screwdrivers and\n\n210\n00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.422\nstuff that you'd have to use,\nand even before that,\n\n211\n00:10:45.422 --> 00:10:49.347\nwhen you're talking about the old Parallel\nATA drives, they were a nightmare to work\n\n212\n00:10:49.347 --> 00:10:52.808\nwith especially with the big old ribbon\ncables that you used to have to use.\n\n213\n00:10:52.808 --> 00:10:54.705\nIt used to be a nightmare\nto get these in and out.\n\n214\n00:10:54.705 --> 00:10:59.495\nToday, not so bad,\nwe put our little guides here in place and\n\n215\n00:10:59.495 --> 00:11:02.655\nwhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna take that drive.\n\n216\n00:11:02.655 --> 00:11:06.935\nAnd we're just going to basically line\nit back up here, you can see, and\n\n217\n00:11:06.935 --> 00:11:10.880\nyou might have to move that\nback up to unlock it here.\n\n218\n00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.220\nAnd they just kind of guide\nthemselves right back into place.\n\n219\n00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.610\nThat's one of the great things\nabout having a drive like this.\n\n220\n00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.070\nNow, notice something here.\n\n221\n00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:22.400\nI did push that down and it wont let\nit go all the way back in place,\n\n222\n00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:27.560\nso make sure that you seat that in\nthe right location and seat it firmly so\n\n223\n00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.250\nthat you don't have to worry about\nthe drive rattling around in there.\n\n224\n00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:35.340\nBecause the mechanical drives can move a\ngood bit especially if you talk about high\n\n225\n00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.630\nRPM drives.\n\n226\n00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.940\nThen what we're gonna do here,\nI know it's hard to see,\n\n227\n00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.400\nI'm gonna get my hand out of there is I'm\njust gonna replace this power connector.\n\n228\n00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.780\nAnd that is replaced.\n\n229\n00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.680\nAnd then the next thing that we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna take the data cable and\n\n230\n00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.120\nwe're gonna go ahead, and the good thing\nabout the serial ATA specification is\n\n231\n00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.760\nyou will notice that there's\nthese little blades, right?\n\n232\n00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.960\nSo it's kinda difficult\nto get them in wrong.\n\n233\n00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:07.460\nThey line up fairly easy and\nit really is just as simple as that.\n\n234\n00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.170\nWe've replaced the hard drive and\nit didn't take too much.\n\n235\n00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:13.060\nNow, one of the last things that\nwe're going to do before we\n\n236\n00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.980\nget into installing our operating system\nis I'm just going to go ahead and\n\n237\n00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.130\ndisconnect the ESD wrist strap, right?\n\n238\n00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.140\nAnd then it's just a matter of replacing-\n&gt;&gt; Safety first, always.\n\n239\n00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:22.940\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.\n\n240\n00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.250\nWe're gonna replace the case, and then in\nthe next part of this, what we're gonna\n\n241\n00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.520\nshow you is, now that you've replaced your\ndrive, if you were to turn around and\n\n242\n00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.430\nreboot this computer,\nit would give you the same error, right?\n\n243\n00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:36.300\nIt would say, you need to have\nan appropriate boot device.\n\n244\n00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.418\nWhy is that?\n\n245\n00:12:37.418 --> 00:12:39.130\nWell, we don't have\nan operating system on that.\n\n246\n00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:43.156\nSo in the second part of this, what we're\ngoing to show you is how to obtain your\n\n247\n00:12:43.156 --> 00:12:46.999\noperating system, make a bootable usb\ndrive, throw it in the computer and\n\n248\n00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:48.970\ninstall your operating system.\n\n249\n00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.830\nSo, fairly straight forward, right?\n\n250\n00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:52.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, great job.\n\n251\n00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.720\n&gt;&gt; Not do difficult, thank you there, so\nlet's go ahead, one of the last things\n\n252\n00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.710\nthat we're going to do is we're going to\njust replace the cover, so I can go ahead,\n\n253\n00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:02.780\nZach if you can help me out here\n&gt;&gt; This is fairly easy and again,\n\n254\n00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.120\nit's just matter of replacing down.\n\n255\n00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.300\nYou can see we're just putting the case\nback on here and that's it, right?\n\n256\n00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.820\nSo pretty straight forward,\nnot too difficult.\n\n257\n00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:17.500\nSo just make sure that when it comes down\nto it and when we you do replace your hard\n\n258\n00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.470\ndrive, just pay attention to what\nthe motherboard manufacturer,\n\n259\n00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:25.090\nthe specifications of the motherboard.\n\n260\n00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:29.921\nSo you know which of the standards\nthat it is that you have to use or\n\n261\n00:13:29.921 --> 00:13:33.150\npurchase when you replace the hard drive.\n\n262\n00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.571\nThe other thing to keep in mind too,\nremember safety.\n\n263\n00:13:36.571 --> 00:13:40.172\nYou want to disconnect any power from\nthe machine before you get in there and\n\n264\n00:13:40.172 --> 00:13:41.780\nyou start working with it.\n\n265\n00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.240\nThe other thing too is, I know that\nsome people use them, some people don't,\n\n266\n00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.170\nbut also make sure that you're using your\nelectrostatic discharge wrist wraps or\n\n267\n00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.730\ndoing self grounding techniques, just by\ntouching the inside of the case because\n\n268\n00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:56.780\nyou certainly don't want to try to\nreplace a damaged component, and\n\n269\n00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.310\nthen damage additional components\nwhen you're replacing them.\n\n270\n00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:00.191\n&gt;&gt; Didn't he do a wonderful job?\n\n271\n00:14:00.191 --> 00:14:05.032\nhe made it look so easy, and this has been\nHDD replacement, and installation, and\n\n272\n00:14:05.032 --> 00:14:06.500\nby the way this part one.\n\n273\n00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.986\nPart two, we do the operating system, so\nyou wanna make sure you watch that, and\n\n274\n00:14:09.986 --> 00:14:12.617\nin fact watch everything in the series,\na PC maintainance.\n\n275\n00:14:12.617 --> 00:14:15.994\nAs Wes mentioned earlier go to our\ncourse library, hundreds of videos, and\n\n276\n00:14:15.994 --> 00:14:18.190\nthey're all designed to do one thing.\n\n277\n00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.528\nHelp you go further.\n\n278\n00:14:19.528 --> 00:14:22.042\nHey, tell everybody you\nknow about ITProTV.\n\n279\n00:14:22.042 --> 00:14:23.179\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n280\n00:14:23.179 --> 00:14:24.720\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n281\n00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.403\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n282\n00:14:25.403 --> 00:14:26.562\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n283\n00:14:28.290 -->

configuration.\n\n10\n00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:30.090\nWes, good to have you here.\n\n11\n00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.750\nThanks for being here.\n\n12\n00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.330\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me here, Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.495\nBut yeah, I do have to let\nyou in on a little secret.\n\n14\n00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:36.610\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n&gt;&gt; Every time I play the video games,\n\n15\n00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.530\nI never pick the good side.\n\n16\n00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.330\nI always pick the dark side,\nthe bad guy, that's right.\n\n17\n00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.880\nSo unfortunately,\nyou're in for a treat here.\n\n18\n00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.838\n&gt;&gt; You're a good guy here,\nthat's all [CROSSTALK]\n\n19\n00:00:45.838 --> 00:00:46.548\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n20\n00:00:46.548 --> 00:00:49.246\nvery good, so\nin past episodes, Zach and I,\n\n21\n00:00:49.246 --> 00:00:53.160\nwe've walked you through\nthe process of that trouble, right?\n\n22\n00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.620\nIt's nerve wracking when you\nturn on your computer, right,\n\n23\n00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.930\nand you've learned that, well,\nthe hard drive's failed.\n\n24\n00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.110\nSo in past episodes, what we've showed\nyou how to do is how to replace\n\n25\n00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.210\nthe hard drive itself and then just\nget the operating system installed.\n\n26\n00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.010\nWell, we kind of left you right there,\nright?\n\n27\n00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.940\nSo in this episode, we're kinda\njust building off of what we've\n\n28\n00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.600\nlearned in the other episodes,\nnot a part two or anything here.\n\n29\n00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.330\nSo this is separate, because the great\nthing is, this surprise, even if your hard\n\n30\n00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.960\ndrive hasn't failed, maybe you need\nto install an operating system.\n\n31\n00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.692\nMaybe you've got a grandmother or\nmom, for that matter,\n\n32\n00:01:25.692 --> 00:01:27.911\nthat maybe's not too tech savvy.\n\n33\n00:01:27.911 --> 00:01:29.871\nAnd you've had to reinstall\nthe operating system, and\n\n34\n00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:32.550\nyou're going through the initial\nconfigurations for the very first time.\n\n35\n00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.730\nSo understand that just because\nwe're building on that, hey,\n\n36\n00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.810\nwe've replaced the hard drive, right?\n\n37\n00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.626\nNow we gotta get in and finish\nthe installation of the operating system.\n\n38\n00:01:40.626 --> 00:01:43.649\nUnderstand that the use\ncase scenarios on this\n\n39\n00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.680\ngo well beyond just\na hard drive replacement.\n\n40\n00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.516\nLike I said, you probably had that friend,\nmaybe you are that friend.\n\n41\n00:01:50.516 --> 00:01:55.518\n[LAUGH] That has said, man, I got all of\nthese viruses on my computer or something.\n\n42\n00:01:55.518 --> 00:01:58.237\nAnd now I've gotta reinstall\nthe operating system.\n\n43\n00:01:58.237 --> 00:02:01.139\nMaybe you've booted into\na factory recovery partition, and\n\n44\n00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:03.386\nit's walking you through\nthe initial set ups.\n\n45\n00:02:03.386 --> 00:02:06.960\nWell, that's what we're gonna be\nlooking at here in this episode.\n\n46\n00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.020\nWhat do we have to do to\nfinalize a Windows installation?\n\n47\n00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.650\n&gt;&gt; So are we looking at it from where\nwe've downloaded the Windows 10, right?\n\n48\n00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.010\nSo we're ready to go with Windows 10,\nso now we're gonna configure it and\n\n49\n00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.952\nget that thing working.\n\n50\n00:02:18.952 --> 00:02:21.310\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, yeah,\nin one of the episodes,\n\n51\n00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.600\nwe did exactly that, right, Zach?\n\n52\n00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.860\nWe downloaded our operating system,\nwe converted it into a USB drive,\n\n53\n00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.900\ninto a bootable media.\n\n54\n00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.720\nAnd we installed the operating system, and\nwe said in another episode, this episode,\n\n55\n00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.750\nwe're gonna show you how to\nfinish the configuration.\n\n56\n00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.940\nSo that's where we're at right now.\n\n57\n00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.820\nIn fact, I've got the Windows\nmachine pretty much sitting here,\n\n58\n00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.210\nwhere we left it in\nthose previous episodes.\n\n59\n00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.070\nNow, you're gonna notice something here,\nZach.\n\n60\n00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.981\nAnd you notice these matted\nbars around the outside?\n\n61\n00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:48.500\nI mean, this is a fresh installation.\n\n62\n00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.130\nAnd it's so fresh of an installation\nthat we don't even have the video\n\n63\n00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.830\ndrivers, right?\n\n64\n00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.923\nYou can see this,\nwhat they call a basic VGA display, right?\n\n65\n00:02:54.923 --> 00:02:59.770\nIt's the old, what is it, 640 by 480\nresolution, so the replacement for\n\n66\n00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.281\nmonochrome 30 years, 40 years ago.\n\n67\n00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:06.100\n[LAUGH] So, you can see that\nthis is a fresh installation.\n\n68\n00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.218\nNow, there's a couple of things that you\nhave to go through post installation,\n\n69\n00:03:10.218 --> 00:03:10.770\nright?\n\n70\n00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.090\nIt's gone through,\nit's installed the files, right?\n\n71\n00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.290\nWe've rebooted the machine here, and\nnow we're sitting at this screen,\n\n72\n00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.620\nand we gotta figure out what to do.\n\n73\n00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.060\nWell, the great thing about Windows 10,\nand really, things like UBUNTU,\n\n74\n00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.970\nUBUNTU is really good about this too.\n\n75\n00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.838\nThat their graphical user interface,\nis it's pretty user friendly.\n\n76\n00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:31.147\nIt's pretty straightforward, it shows\nyou what it is that you're configuring\n\n77\n00:03:31.147 --> 00:03:36.704\nas you walk through this little graphical\nuser interface wizard driven interface.\n\n78\n00:03:36.704 --> 00:03:40.832\nAll right, so very first thing that we're\ngonna do is, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n79\n00:03:40.832 --> 00:03:43.758\nwe're gonna configure our\nregional settings, right?\n\n80\n00:03:43.758 --> 00:03:46.323\nAnd you could say that we're gonna\nchoose United States here, right?\n\n81\n00:03:46.323 --> 00:03:48.248\nSo we'll go ahead, and we'll choose that.\n\n82\n00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:51.645\nAnd then, what we're gonna do from\nhere is we're gonna choose Yes, right?\n\n83\n00:03:51.645 --> 00:03:54.894\nAnd we'll just go ahead, and it will\nconfigure the regional settings, but\n\n84\n00:03:54.894 --> 00:03:58.267\nwe've got some other things that we\nhave to do, right, our keyboard layout.\n\n85\n00:03:58.267 --> 00:04:01.830\nNow we have viewers that are all\nover the world, all right?\n\n86\n00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.243\nSo, I'm just doing this centric\nto the United States, and\n\n87\n00:04:05.243 --> 00:04:09.630\nI know that we have viewers in other\nparts of this great, big, giant world.\n\n88\n00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.272\nSo, if your regional settings\nare different, that's okay.\n\n89\n00:04:13.272 --> 00:04:17.520\nJust adjust them to whatever your\nlocal regional settings might be.\n\n90\n00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.571\nIn this case,\nI'm gonna use the keyboard layout of US.\n\n91\n00:04:20.571 --> 00:04:23.549\nDon't worry, I'm not gonna set\nyou up with a Dvorak keyboard for\n\n92\n00:04:23.549 --> 00:04:26.271\nthe five people in the world\nwho've ever used that layout.\n\n93\n00:04:26.271 --> 00:04:28.451\nAll right, and you can see-\n&gt;&gt; I use Dvorak all the time.\n\n94\n00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:29.197\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n95\n00:04:29.197 --> 00:04:32.640\nAnd you can see there are tons of choices,\nright?\n\n96\n00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.550\nAgain, German, French, Greek,\nyou can see it, Hawaiian, Hungarian, so\n\n97\n00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.050\na lot of different choices here.\n\n98\n00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.178\nAnd again,\nwhatever your local regional settings\n\n99\n00:04:42.178 --> 00:04:45.154\nare as well as your keyboard layout.\n\n100\n00:04:45.154 --> 00:04:48.323\nAnd again,\nit's already kind of selected for\n\n101\n00:04:48.323 --> 00:04:53.537\nme based on the language version of\nthe install that I was doing, all right?\n\n102\n00:04:53.537 --> 00:04:56.546\nAnd we'll choose again through this,\nwe'll just choose,\n\n103\n00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.520\nmy head's kinda covering it up there,\nwe'll choose Yes.\n\n104\n00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.200\nThere we go, make it a little bit better.\n\n105\n00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.950\nNow it does ask me if I wanna\nset up a second keyboard layout.\n\n106\n00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.920\nNow let me go ahead and take the time.\n\n107\n00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.980\nI probably should have explained this\nbefore we started walking through this.\n\n108\n00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.930\nUnderstand that this is the Windows\n10 Creator Fall Update,\n\n109\n00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.490\nmore specifically, 1709.\n\n110\n00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.390\nSo if you're on some of\nthe previous builds and\n\n111\n00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.110\nyou haven't upgraded to the newer version,\nthe interface might be slightly different.\n\n112\n00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.960\nIt's not so drastically different that\nyou couldn't follow along at home,\n\n113\n00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.620\njust understand that this is cutting edge.\n\n114\n00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.870\nCutting edge version of Windows, and\nagain, it's the 1709 update, if you will.\n\n115\n00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.700\nNow we've got the ability that if we want,\nwe could add this layout, or\n\n116\n00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.540\nI can just skip it.\n\n117\n00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.835\nI'm not gonna add another layout,\nthat's fine.\n\n118\n00:05:42.835 --> 00:05:46.730\nI'm doing good with just one keyboard,\nlet alone two.\n\n119\n00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.770\nAll right, and now what it's gonna see\nis it says all right, you're connected.\n\n120\n00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.086\nAnd notice that it's setting\nup my network connection.\n\n121\n00:05:52.086 --> 00:05:54.865\nWe'll talk a little bit more about\nsome of the post installation\n\n122\n00:05:54.865 --> 00:05:56.056\nconsiderations, right?\n\n123\n00:05:56.056 --> 00:06:00.440\nI mean, this is post, but this is really\nright before you get into the interface.\n\n124\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.974\nSo what it's doing right now,\nall right, is it's saying, hey,\n\n125\n00:06:03.974 --> 00:06:08.594\nwe're gonna reach out to Windows Update,\nand we'll pull down some drivers, right?\n\n126\n00:06:08.594 --> 00:06:12.035\nOur drivers are just what allows our\noperating system to communicate with\n\n127\n00:06:12.035 --> 00:06:15.330\nthe hardware that this machine\nessentially has in it.\n\n128\n00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.710\nNow understand, this isn't like\nnormal Windows updates, right?\n\n129\n00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.635\nSo maybe some of you guys and gals out\nthere are familiar with Windows, and\n\n130\n00:06:23.635 --> 00:06:26.119\nyou update your machine quite often,\nright?\n\n131\n00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:27.869\nWhat's going on here is,\n\n132\n00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:33.230\nwe haven't really opted into letting\nWindows do the updates, all right?\n\n133\n00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.980\nPart of the installation process is that\nit reaches out to the Windows Update\n\n134\n00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.550\nservers, and\nit only pulls down the drivers\n\n135\n00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.340\nthat are essential to get\nthe operating system installed, right?\n\n136\n00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.002\nNow after that, it is up to us to make\nsure that we enable Windows Updates and\n\n137\n00:06:49.002 --> 00:06:51.964\nthat we continue to\nreceive security updates.\n\n138\n00:06:51.964 --> 00:06:56.878\nWe continue to receive any kind of\ndriver updates that might make their way\n\n139\n00:06:56.878 --> 00:06:58.473\ninto Windows Updates.\n\n140\n00:06:58.473 --> 00:07:00.942\nAnd that can happen and it happens.\n\n141\n00:07:00.942 --> 00:07:07.429\nThere are times, if you will, when a\nmanufacturer will provide a driver update,\n\n142\n00:07:07.429 --> 00:07:12.990\nand it will make its way into\nthe Windows Update library, if you will.\n\n143\n00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.740\nAnd that periodically,\nyour computer has to reach out and update.\n\n144\n00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.110\nAll right, so you can see right here my\ncomputer's actually restarting right now.\n\n145\n00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.990\nAnd what it did is it said okay, we found\njust the drivers that we needed to finish\n\n146\n00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.770\nthe update, so that you can\nstart to log into the machine.\n\n147\n00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.220\nAnd then we can do those configurations\nthat really have to happen after this\n\n148\n00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.390\nfact, right?\n\n149\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.950\nSo what else do we have to do, all right?\n\n150\n00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.420\nWell, we've done our regional settings.\n\n151\n00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.000\nWe've done our keyboard settings.\n\n152\n00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.830\nAnd the next thing that we have\nto do is we have to set up what's\n\n153\n00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:43.970\nknown as a local account.\n\n154\n00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.420\nAnd there are a couple of different\nways that you can do this, right?\n\n155\n00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.560\nOne of the local accounts is a strict\nlocal account that is gonna reside\n\n156\n00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:57.070\non the hard drive we just put in on\na prior episode on this machine.\n\n157\n00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:01.146\nNow there are other ways that you can\nactually log on to Windows as well, and\n\n158\n00:08:01.146 --> 00:08:03.684\nthis is something that\nstarted in Windows 8.\n\n159\n00:08:03.684 --> 00:08:06.311\nAll right, and\nthat's a Microsoft account, all right?\n\n160\n00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:09.677\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes, you said the local account\nresides on the computer, on the device,\n\n161\n00:08:09.677 --> 00:08:10.720\nthe machine.\n\n162\n00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.505\nWhere does the Microsoft account reside?\n\n163\n00:08:13.505 --> 00:08:15.735\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach, it's magic.\n\n164\n00:08:15.735 --> 00:08:17.580\n&gt;&gt; I knew it.\n&gt;&gt; No, just kidding, it's not magic.\n\n165\n00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.300\n&gt;&gt; I knew there were little wizards\nwith wands and we just don't see them.\n\n166\n00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.141\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n167\n00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:22.616\n[LAUGH] So starting with Windows 8,\n\n168\n00:08:22.616 --> 00:08:25.723\none of the things that they did is that\nyou can have a cloud-based account.\n\n169\n00:08:25.723 --> 00:08:28.060\nAnd well, you've probably heard\nof the buzzword cloud, right?\n\n170\n00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.400\nSo that means that\nthey're gonna manage it.\n\n171\n00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.377\nBut one of the great things about that is\nit allows you to login to your Windows\n\n172\n00:08:33.377 --> 00:08:33.950\nmachine.\n\n173\n00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:38.671\nAnd if you've got an Internet connection,\nit can reach out and it can say, yeah,\n\n174\n00:08:38.671 --> 00:08:39.720\nI know who you are.\n\n175\n00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.928\nOr if maybe you're reinstalling\nyour operating system, hint, hint,\n\n176\n00:08:42.928 --> 00:08:46.040\nlike we're doing now and\nyou already have a Microsoft account.\n\n177\n00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.300\nI don't have to worry about\nrecreating a local account or\n\n178\n00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.850\ncreating a Microsoft account.\n\n179\n00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.930\nWhat I can do is I can log in and,\nin fact, let me show you.\n\n180\n00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:57.355\nI can sign in just like it tells me right\nhere with the Microsoft account and\n\n181\n00:08:57.355 --> 00:09:00.447\nwhen I do it's gonna reach out to\nthe cloud and it's gonna say hey,\n\n182\n00:09:00.447 --> 00:09:02.070\nwhat were your desktop settings?\n\n183\n00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.070\nDid you have any files or\nfolders that you backed up to OneDrive?\n\n184\n00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.200\nAnd if you have, do you want us\nto synchronize those back down so\n\n185\n00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.890\nyou can basically recover some of\nthe things that maybe you've lost?\n\n186\n00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.920\nNow I'm not gonna set that up here.\n\n187\n00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.516\nKeep in mind that if you are gonna set up\na Microsoft account, you have to go out to\n\n188\n00:09:17.516 --> 00:09:21.061\nMicrosoft, and you have to go through\nthe registration process, and again,\n\n189\n00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.320\nset up your email address.\n\n190\n00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.740\nIt's very, very simplistic.\n\n191\n00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:28.640\nNow if you don't wanna do that,\nsome people, big brother's out there.\n\n192\n00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.902\nSome people got the paranoid attitude\njust because I think people are after me\n\n193\n00:09:31.902 --> 00:09:33.521\ndoesn't mean they're not, right?\n\n194\n00:09:33.521 --> 00:09:34.996\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And they put the tinfoil hat on and\n\n195\n00:09:34.996 --> 00:09:37.770\nthey're like no, I just want it\nto reside on the local machine.\n\n196\n00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:38.930\nWell, that's okay.\n\n197\n00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.240\nWell, let's look here.\n\n198\n00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.560\nWhere does it say sign\nin with a local account?\n\n199\n00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.000\nAnd unfortunately, it doesn't.\n\n200\n00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.830\nAnd this is where it kinda gets confusing,\nright?\n\n201\n00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.880\nIt doesn't say a local account, and\n\n202\n00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:57.060\nthat's this little button right here, this\nlittle hyperlink, Domain join instead.\n\n203\n00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.721\nNow this means you can join a corporate\nWindows domain that's managed in\n\n204\n00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:02.352\nan enterprise level business.\n\n205\n00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:04.110\nIt doesn't mean you have to.\n\n206\n00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.622\nWhat it means though is,\nit's kind of cryptic that when I\n\n207\n00:10:07.622 --> 00:10:12.096\nchoose Domain join instead,\nnotice it says, who's gonna use this PC?\n\n208\n00:10:12.096 --> 00:10:16.573\nAnd this is where we do our local\naccount configuration, all right?\n\n209\n00:10:16.573 --> 00:10:22.084\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'll go ahead,\nand I'll just say, let's see, admin.\n\n210\n00:10:22.084 --> 00:10:25.010\nI'm gonna type in the username here and\nI'm just gonna keep it simple,\n\n211\n00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.920\nbecause I'm gonna call it Admin,\nall right?\n\n212\n00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.090\nYou call this whatever you want,\nall right?\n\n213\n00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:35.000\nJust understand that this account,\nthe first account that you log in with,\n\n214\n00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.180\nis the administrative account.\n\n215\n00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:40.320\nIt's the local administrator, and the fact\nthat the administrator's gonna be able to\n\n216\n00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.690\ndo the configurations that\nyou're gonna see here.\n\n217\n00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.480\nGo ahead and check Windows update.\n\n218\n00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.590\nInstall those updates.\n\n219\n00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:46.980\nSo this is a pretty powerful account.\n\n220\n00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.030\nAnd if you're setting this up for\n\n221\n00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.320\nchildren, keep in mind out there\nthat this is gonna have full access.\n\n222\n00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.842\nYou can always set up, which we're gonna\nshow you how to set up additional accounts\n\n223\n00:10:54.842 --> 00:10:56.866\nlater that you can then\nrestrict if you need to.\n\n224\n00:10:56.866 --> 00:10:59.705\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nonce that's done,\n\n225\n00:10:59.705 --> 00:11:02.627\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll choose Next.\n\n226\n00:11:02.627 --> 00:11:06.651\nAll right, and create a super\nmemorable password, all right, so.\n\n227\n00:11:06.651 --> 00:11:09.013\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna go ahead and do that,\n\n228\n00:11:09.013 --> 00:11:11.342\n123456, and then click Next.\n\n229\n00:11:11.342 --> 00:11:15.979\nAnd then we have to confirm\nthat password again, 123456,\n\n230\n00:11:15.979 --> 00:11:18.910\ncuz, boy, even I can memorize that.\n\n231\n00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.390\nZach, you might have to change\nthe password to your luggage now.\n\n232\n00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.365\n&gt;&gt; It's super memorable.\n\n233\n00:11:22.365 --> 00:11:23.239\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It sure is.\n\n234\n00:11:23.239 --> 00:11:24.151\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you that.\n\n235\n00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:27.245\n&gt;&gt; So now that we've got that\npassword there, I'll go ahead and\n\n236\n00:11:27.245 --> 00:11:28.980\nwhat I'll do is I'll click Next.\n\n237\n00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.420\nAll right, and\nwe're gonna add a hint for the password.\n\n238\n00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.670\nNow that's up to you.\n\n239\n00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.330\nI'm doing this just for\n\n240\n00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:39.750\nthe purposes really of remembering\nit in my virtual machine.\n\n241\n00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:45.010\nI would not, in any way,\ndo this in a live environment, all right?\n\n242\n00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.870\nBecause some of you out there that\nhave been around some of our,\n\n243\n00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.980\nmaybe some of our other classes or\nmaybe going over to some of our other\n\n244\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.704\ncourse content in our library-\n&gt;&gt; And you should.\n\n245\n00:11:52.704 --> 00:11:56.890\n&gt;&gt; You might notice what the password is,\njust by the hint.\n\n246\n00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:58.490\nIt shouldn't do that in real life,\nall right.\n\n247\n00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:03.030\nSo now what it's doing, all right,\nis it's asking us some additional things,\n\n248\n00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.320\nwhat additional things\nthat we want to use.\n\n249\n00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:11.210\nNow if any of you out there\nmight happen to be, let's say,\n\n250\n00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:15.850\nvisually impaired, maybe it's hearing,\nmaybe you're one of these\n\n251\n00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.680\nones that has color blind,\nyou need to see things in high contrast.\n\n252\n00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.460\nI know I got four eyes here, so\nvision can get me from time to time.\n\n253\n00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.810\nThey have the Ease of Access Center.\n\n254\n00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:30.401\nAnd it allows you to do things like\nturn on the Narrator, the Magnifier,\n\n255\n00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:35.145\nOn-Screen Keyboard, High Contrast,\nlike I mentioned, Sticky Keys and\n\n256\n00:12:35.145 --> 00:12:36.747\nthen Filter Keys, too.\n\n257\n00:12:36.747 --> 00:12:41.462\nI know I've got a family member that\nsuffers from trembling hands, and\n\n258\n00:12:41.462 --> 00:12:43.120\nit's a heredity thing.\n\n259\n00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.480\nAnd she has to worry about shaking hands.\n\n260\n00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.960\nWell, you can also get it to ignore\nrepetitive keystrokes and stuff like that.\n\n261\n00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.410\nYou could also choose the mic.\n\n262\n00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.350\nAnd believe it or not, in the background,\nCortana's actually listening to me.\n\n263\n00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:58.500\nSo those of you out there that\nmay be having privacy concerns,\n\n264\n00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.052\nwe're going to address that\nhere in this episode as well.\n\n265\n00:13:01.052 --> 00:13:03.260\nWell, now it's asking me,\n\n266\n00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.380\ndo I wanna make Cortana your\npersonal assistant, all right?\n\n267\n00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.730\nAnd this is just like you see in other\noperating systems, you got okay Google.\n\n268\n00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:14.940\nYou have things like Siri inside of\nApple's MacOS and their iOS as well.\n\n269\n00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.520\nSo this is up to you if you\nwanna use this, all right?\n\n270\n00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.340\nAnd we also get the ability to respond\nwhen I say, hey, Cortana, right?\n\n271\n00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.720\nThink about it, you all out there\nthat have maybe an iOS device.\n\n272\n00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.430\nHey, Siri, right, and it comes up.\n\n273\n00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:28.670\nYou can say, hey, Cortana, and\n\n274\n00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.880\nthen it'll allow you to work your\nway through the operating system.\n\n275\n00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.280\nAnd then there are some just kind\nof privacy information here, right?\n\n276\n00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.580\nThis information that they talk about\nincludes location, location history,\n\n277\n00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.230\ncontact.\n\n278\n00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.220\nAnd you can see a slew of\nother things right here.\n\n279\n00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.260\nAnd if you need to pause this,\nyou can always pause this and read this.\n\n280\n00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.880\nBut it's privacy information because,\nguess what?\n\n281\n00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.730\nSomebody is listening in on your\nconversation, once you say yes to this.\n\n282\n00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.300\nI'm gonna go ahead for\nnow, and just say no.\n\n283\n00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.510\nAnd here's all of the different\nprivacy settings.\n\n284\n00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:00.720\nAnd nice thing is you can get some\ninformation to kind of help you.\n\n285\n00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.070\nAnd this is gonna go away, and it did.\n\n286\n00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.552\nIt just says hey, Microsoft,\nthese are the recommended settings, right?\n\n287\n00:14:05.552 --> 00:14:06.616\nYou can see Location.\n\n288\n00:14:06.616 --> 00:14:08.714\nDo you wanna get\nlocation-based experience?\n\n289\n00:14:08.714 --> 00:14:14.400\nDiagnostics, right, this is part of\nthe Windows Experience Improvement Program\n\n290\n00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.640\nthat they have, WEIP, yeah,\nExperience Improvement Program.\n\n291\n00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.120\nI had to think about that acronym for\na bit.\n\n292\n00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.470\nDiagnostics, it's the same thing.\n\n293\n00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.332\nIt's just called something\na little bit different.\n\n294\n00:14:24.332 --> 00:14:29.626\nSo if you guys are seeing WEIP in past\neditions of Windows, that's what this is.\n\n295\n00:14:29.626 --> 00:14:31.943\nRelevant ads, all right.\n\n296\n00:14:31.943 --> 00:14:34.314\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What do you think,\n\n297\n00:14:34.314 --> 00:14:37.855\nyou think I wanna install a fresh\nbrand new operating system, Zach, and\n\n298\n00:14:37.855 --> 00:14:41.242\nI wanna watch some advertisements\non something that I just paid for?\n\n299\n00:14:41.242 --> 00:14:44.352\n&gt;&gt; Why, yes, Wes, I believe you\nwanna see as many ads as possible.\n\n300\n00:14:44.352 --> 00:14:46.612\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nwhat he means by that is no.\n\n301\n00:14:46.612 --> 00:14:49.371\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna go ahead and\n\n302\n00:14:49.371 --> 00:14:51.270\nwe're gonna turn this off.\n\n303\n00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.940\nNotice it says the number of\nads you see won't change,\n\n304\n00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.880\nbut they'll be relevant to you.\n\n305\n00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.270\nWell, thank you, Windows.\n\n306\n00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:00.990\nWe'll show you in other episodes how\nyou can eliminate some of those, too,\n\n307\n00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:02.200\nall right?\n\n308\n00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.610\nSpeech recognition, talk to Cortana and\n\n309\n00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.700\nStore apps that supports\nvoice recognition.\n\n310\n00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.210\nAgain, this is up to you.\n\n311\n00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.760\nAgain, more diagnostics information,\nthat is up to you, right?\n\n312\n00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.800\nNow, Microsoft, like I said,\nthis is what they recommend.\n\n313\n00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.760\nSo you could always leave this on.\n\n314\n00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.280\nIf you wanna know more information,\n\n315\n00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.560\nwell, you guys are a smart\ncrowd out there, learn more.\n\n316\n00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.330\nWe're just gonna go ahead and\naccept the settings.\n\n317\n00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.987\nKeep in mind that when you\naccept the settings on this,\n\n318\n00:15:27.987 --> 00:15:32.293\nthat doesn't say I can't change\nthem from here on out, right?\n\n319\n00:15:32.293 --> 00:15:33.894\nWe can go into the Action Center, and\n\n320\n00:15:33.894 --> 00:15:36.152\nwe can adjust the settings after the fact,\nright?\n\n321\n00:15:36.152 --> 00:15:40.283\nSo I don't want you to think that by\nsetting this up just like this that you\n\n322\n00:15:40.283 --> 00:15:41.994\ncan't go back to it, right?\n\n323\n00:15:41.994 --> 00:15:43.832\nAnd one of the things, in fact,\n\n324\n00:15:43.832 --> 00:15:47.780\nif we can bring my computer up here for\njust a second now.\n\n325\n00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:52.475\nThis is what happens for the first\ntime a user logs into the machine.\n\n326\n00:15:52.475 --> 00:15:54.845\nWhat's happening is it's\nbuilding that environment,\n\n327\n00:15:54.845 --> 00:15:56.285\nthat local account environment.\n\n328\n00:15:56.285 --> 00:15:59.582\nIt's got a little template out there and\nit pulls this information down and\n\n329\n00:15:59.582 --> 00:16:00.478\ncreates you a copy.\n\n330\n00:16:00.478 --> 00:16:03.696\nThe same will apply as I show you\nhow to create additional accounts,\n\n331\n00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:06.350\nif you need to set up multiple\naccounts on the machines,\n\n332\n00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.970\nbecause you might be doing this for\na family member.\n\n333\n00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.530\nWhile this is your\nadministrative account and\n\n334\n00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:13.640\nmaybe you create them separate account and\nthey log into that account.\n\n335\n00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.730\nAnd you use this account to\nhelp them with their machine.\n\n336\n00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:17.490\nThat's up to you,\n\n337\n00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:21.620\njust understand, that every time you\nlog in, that's what's going on here.\n\n338\n00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:26.330\nSo, rather than make you just sit here and\nstare at a progress screen, what we're\n\n339\n00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.320\ngoing to do is use the magic of TV,\nwe'll come back, when this is finished.\n\n340\n00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.640\nGotta love Zach, the magic of TV timeouts.\n\n341\n00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:39.340\nI tell ya, in my IT career I wish\nin all like server configurations,\n\n342\n00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:43.915\nsoftware configuration I could use like\na coffee break, or a TV timeout and\n\n343\n00:16:43.915 --> 00:16:45.125\nnot have to wait for the reboot.\n\n344\n00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:47.285\nBut the machine has rebooted right?\n\n345\n00:16:47.285 --> 00:16:50.195\nAnd this is the first\nscreen that you'll see and\n\n346\n00:16:50.195 --> 00:16:53.605\nyou'll notice one of the things\nwe have to do after the fact is.\n\n347\n00:16:53.605 --> 00:16:56.485\nWell we've got to make\na choice here in the network.\n\n348\n00:16:56.485 --> 00:17:00.195\nNow the choice that you make right here is\n\n349\n00:17:00.195 --> 00:17:03.040\nsomething that you really\ntake into consideration.\n\n350\n00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.150\nNotice that it's saying, do you want\nto allow your PC to be discoverable by\n\n351\n00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.830\nother PCs and devices on this network?\n\n352\n00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:16.070\nWe recommend allowing this on your home\nand work networks, but not public ones.\n\n353\n00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:18.300\nThis is a laptop that I'm gonna take and\n\n354\n00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.970\nmaybe I'm gonna go to\nthe local coffee shop.\n\n355\n00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:21.740\nAnd I'm gonna jump on the WiFi hotspot.\n\n356\n00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.660\nChances are you're gonna wanna choose\nno here, and I'll tell you a little\n\n357\n00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.640\nbit more about what that choice\nactually does here in a second.\n\n358\n00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.490\nIn this case, we're just going\nfrom the scenario that maybe you\n\n359\n00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.590\nare supporting somebody\nwho's hard drive has failed.\n\n360\n00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:36.100\nMaybe it's your own, your own if I can say\nthat right, but maybe it's your own, or\n\n361\n00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.190\nmaybe it's your family member.\n\n362\n00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.100\nSo, I'm gonna say yes.\n\n363\n00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:43.050\nAnd what this does is it\nconfigures our Windows Firewall.\n\n364\n00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:47.570\nThe security software that\neither allows communication\n\n365\n00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:51.490\nover the network into our computer or\nblocks it.\n\n366\n00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:55.260\nIf I say No, it's very restrictive.\n\n367\n00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.000\nIt lays down the iron gauntlet.\n\n368\n00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.260\nAnd it says that's it.\n\n369\n00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.220\nAll the communication coming\ninto your computer and\n\n370\n00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.990\na lot of the communication going out of\nyour computer is going to be blocked.\n\n371\n00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:10.270\nSo that might be a setting that\nI want on a public network.\n\n372\n00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.920\nNow, the next thing that we have to do is,\n\n373\n00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.560\nyou might see that your date and\ntime is off.\n\n374\n00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.790\nAnd my head's always covering this one up\njust because of where the notification\n\n375\n00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:20.355\nbar is.\n\n376\n00:18:20.355 --> 00:18:22.681\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But notice that it says 7:21 and\n\n377\n00:18:22.681 --> 00:18:26.396\nif I look at my clock right now,\nI've got by Eastern Standard Time.\n\n378\n00:18:26.396 --> 00:18:27.458\n&gt;&gt; I got up too early.\n\n379\n00:18:27.458 --> 00:18:30.689\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you got here way too early Zach.\n\n380\n00:18:30.689 --> 00:18:35.870\nIt is it's actually 10.21 so\nwhen you first install\n\n381\n00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:41.720\nyour operating system the default\nconfiguration is Pacific Time.\n\n382\n00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.640\nAnd if you're in Pacific Time\nthat doesn't affect you at all.\n\n383\n00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.160\nBut all the other time\nzones will have to change.\n\n384\n00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.335\nWe are in the Eastern Standard Time\nzone right here, so\n\n385\n00:18:50.335 --> 00:18:51.862\nI'm gonna make some configuration.\n\n386\n00:18:51.862 --> 00:18:54.835\nAnd again, we still need to go a little\nbit local to our configuration and\n\n387\n00:18:54.835 --> 00:18:57.610\nthat's part of the post\nconfigurations that we wanna do.\n\n388\n00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:59.787\nNot just post installation, that's done.\n\n389\n00:18:59.787 --> 00:19:02.670\nOur operating system's\ninstalled we're logged in.\n\n390\n00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:04.410\nNow we're gonna do\nthe post configurations,\n\n391\n00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:06.190\nlet me show you what you do here.\n\n392\n00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:09.820\nAgain, my heads kind of\ncovering this one up so\n\n393\n00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:13.320\nwe're going to have to\nright click on the time.\n\n394\n00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.820\nAnd you'll notice that\nwe've got a whole bunch of\n\n395\n00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.695\noptions that we can configure if we want,\nor we can use.\n\n396\n00:19:20.695 --> 00:19:23.925\nThe one that I really want here\nis the adjust date and time.\n\n397\n00:19:23.925 --> 00:19:26.555\nThat's the one that's\nreally really crucial here,\n\n398\n00:19:26.555 --> 00:19:29.655\nbecause you'll notice that it says hey,\nset time automatically.\n\n399\n00:19:29.655 --> 00:19:31.275\nI don't mind that one bit.\n\n400\n00:19:31.275 --> 00:19:35.505\nSet time zone, automatically,\nnow I don't want that.\n\n401\n00:19:35.505 --> 00:19:37.920\nIf you do, that's perfectly fine.\n\n402\n00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.290\nBut what I want is the time\nzone that I know I'm in.\n\n403\n00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:43.160\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nscroll down, and\n\n404\n00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.669\nI'm gonna find Eastern Time (US &amp; Canada).\n\n405\n00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:51.160\nAnd we're gonna change that and\nnotice we're now within our time zone.\n\n406\n00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.890\nRemember some of the settings that I said\nyou that could change after the fact?\n\n407\n00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:56.546\nNotice that we've got our region and\nlanguage,\n\n408\n00:19:56.546 --> 00:19:58.501\nthese are what we set up initially.\n\n409\n00:19:58.501 --> 00:20:00.950\nYou can get to those\nafter the fact as well.\n\n410\n00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.770\nI don't want you to worry about some\nof those settings that we talked about\n\n411\n00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:04.280\nearlier.\n\n412\n00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:09.290\nThinking again that you\ncannot communicate outbound.\n\n413\n00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:12.540\nNow, there are some additional\nthings that you might wanna do.\n\n414\n00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.810\nWe might wanna make sure that\nwe have a network connection.\n\n415\n00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.560\nWell there's a couple of different\nways that you can do the checking\n\n416\n00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.380\nthe network connection.\n\n417\n00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.230\nSimply you can open your web browser.\n\n418\n00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.310\nYou can browse to a website, right?\n\n419\n00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:26.590\nThe other way that you can do this, too,\nis something that you should be doing\n\n420\n00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:30.420\nafter you install your operation system\nanyways, and that was Windows Updates that\n\n421\n00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:34.440\nwe mentioned when it was reaching out\nto Windows just to finish the install.\n\n422\n00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.000\nYou say well, it already looked for\nupdates and it found a few and\n\n423\n00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.800\nit installed them, so\nwhat do I need to do here?\n\n424\n00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.580\nWell, let me show you.\n\n425\n00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:45.800\nIf I go down to, again, down in the lower\nright-hand portion of the screen here,\n\n426\n00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.330\nyou're going to see that\nthere is a notification,\n\n427\n00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.720\nnotice it says one notification,\nnew notification.\n\n428\n00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.100\nRemember we talked about searching for\n\n429\n00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.788\ndisplay driver, that's why we're\ngetting these little mats right here.\n\n430\n00:20:55.788 --> 00:20:58.355\nAnd again guys, guys out there,\nI do apologize but\n\n431\n00:20:58.355 --> 00:21:00.632\nwe don't have a video\ndriver installed yet.\n\n432\n00:21:00.632 --> 00:21:05.612\nBut what I wanna do is I wanna\nfind this all settings option and\n\n433\n00:21:05.612 --> 00:21:12.490\nif I go into all settings, this will be my\nall settings manual my Windows settings.\n\n434\n00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:16.430\nAnd what I'm looking for\nif I scroll down is the update and\n\n435\n00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:18.270\nsecurity option this is important.\n\n436\n00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:25.240\nI want to make sure that we're up to date,\nright now, there.\n\n437\n00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.640\nNotice what it tells us right away.\n\n438\n00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.910\nIt says, your device is at risk\nbecause it's out of date and\n\n439\n00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.760\nmissing important security and\nquality updates.\n\n440\n00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.810\nLet's get you back on track.\n\n441\n00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.020\nWell at the time of this\n\n442\n00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:39.030\nviewing that you guys might see\na couple weeks prior to this, or\n\n443\n00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:44.300\na week prior to this, this is wherethe\nkey reinstallation and ROCA attacks came.\n\n444\n00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:50.020\nSo, October 19, 2017,\nI know we try not to date these episodes,\n\n445\n00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:55.880\nbut Microsoft pushed out an update to\nfix against those attacks and now when\n\n446\n00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.490\nWindows Update reaches out and it's not\nturned on it gives you this big warning.\n\n447\n00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:03.150\nGoing forward if you're up to date and you\n\n448\n00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.860\nget additional security updates you might\nnot see something as intrusive as this.\n\n449\n00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.650\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna check for updates.\n\n450\n00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.970\nNotice it says, basically that.\n\n451\n00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:13.560\nAll I did was push the button.\n\n452\n00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.150\nAll right, now, notice here,\nsecurity update for\n\n453\n00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:19.900\nWindows defender, we got a lot of updates.\n\n454\n00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.820\nThat tells me right away that\nI'm connected to the internet.\n\n455\n00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:26.010\nBut you might want to go\na little bit farther than that.\n\n456\n00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:31.580\nYou can always, you can either\nlaunch up the Edge browser here or\n\n457\n00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.070\nyou can just type down\nhere in the search field.\n\n458\n00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.260\nYou can type IE.\n\n459\n00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.790\nAll right or I can type IS.\n\n460\n00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:39.300\nCan you help me spell IE apparently?\n\n461\n00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.180\n&gt;&gt; There is an I in it and\nthere's an E in it.\n\n462\n00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:41.810\n&gt;&gt; They're very good.\n\n463\n00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:43.927\nThere we go and\nwe'll just give it a second and\n\n464\n00:22:43.927 --> 00:22:45.724\nnotice there's Internet Explorer.\n\n465\n00:22:45.724 --> 00:22:50.528\nAnd we can always launch up our\nInternet Explorer, and we can use this,\n\n466\n00:22:50.528 --> 00:22:53.667\nand it uses up our first\ntime connection here.\n\n467\n00:22:53.667 --> 00:22:57.243\nAnd we'll go ahead and use recommended\nsettings, and we'll get the news\n\n468\n00:22:57.243 --> 00:23:01.180\nof the day out of here, because maybe you\ndon't want to see that news for the day.\n\n469\n00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:06.500\nMaybe you wanna set up a different\nhomepage, that's up to you let's\n\n470\n00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.590\nshow you how you can do that as part\nof the initial configuration as well.\n\n471\n00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:11.470\nMaybe I know that I'm always and\n\n472\n00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.220\nI'll kinda just go ahead and\nminimize this at the background.\n\n473\n00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:19.330\nI know that I always used the Google's\nwebpage for the search engine.\n\n474\n00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:22.350\nWell, what I can do is I can\ngo up to the little tool\n\n475\n00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.630\ngear icon here in Internet Explorer and\nI can choose that.\n\n476\n00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:29.590\nAnd if I scroll all the way down,\nwe have Internet Options.\n\n477\n00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.745\nAnd here at the Internet Options,\n\n478\n00:23:31.745 --> 00:23:35.026\nyou'll see we have well\nour Internet Options page.\n\n479\n00:23:35.026 --> 00:23:38.807\nNotice by default, it goes to but\nthat can be redone,\n\n480\n00:23:38.807 --> 00:23:41.600\nit goes [LAUGH] to go.microsoft.com.\n\n481\n00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.980\nMaybe that's not what I want.\n\n482\n00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.180\nMaybe I want something like www.\n\n483\n00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.970\nActually, and www will work.\n\n484\n00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:51.730\nIt'll flop over to https.\n\n485\n00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:57.190\nBut we'll go ahead and say,\nmaybe we want Google to be our home page.\n\n486\n00:23:57.190 --> 00:24:00.350\nWell, we could type in Google\ninto the General Settings there.\n\n487\n00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:01.941\nAnd we can choose Apply.\n\n488\n00:24:01.941 --> 00:24:04.168\nPlus the settings keeps\nthe dialogue box down.\n\n489\n00:24:04.168 --> 00:24:08.080\nIf you're not gonna be back here, and\nthat's fine too, you can choose OK.\n\n490\n00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:12.850\nNow, the next time I click\nmy Home icon up here,\n\n491\n00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:16.620\nor when I open up Internet Explorer for\nthe very first time,\n\n492\n00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:21.270\nwhat we should end up seeing is\nthat it goes right over to Google.\n\n493\n00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:24.050\n&gt;&gt; A Google's-\n&gt;&gt; So now I have that set up.\n\n494\n00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:27.660\nI've got that as my default homepage.\n\n495\n00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.170\nMaybe that's what I want.\n\n496\n00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.450\nIf you wanna install things like Chrome,\nI always install Chrome, I use it.\n\n497\n00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:37.328\nBut now notice, every time I open it up,\nI don't get the MSN start page with\n\n498\n00:24:37.328 --> 00:24:41.754\nall the news, I get my Google page\nhere and that might be what I want.\n\n499\n00:24:41.754 --> 00:24:44.714\nNow the other thing that\nyou might have to do, or\n\n500\n00:24:44.714 --> 00:24:48.340\nmaybe it's some configuration\nchanges on the computer.\n\n501\n00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.260\nWhen you first install your computer for\nthe very first time,\n\n502\n00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:56.020\nWindows does by default,\nit gives you this real weird name.\n\n503\n00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.122\nRight, well maybe you want to change\nthe name so that you can recognize it on\n\n504\n00:24:59.122 --> 00:25:02.244\nyour home network, and it doesn't\nhave this crazy string of characters.\n\n505\n00:25:02.244 --> 00:25:06.807\nAnd I wouldn't even be able to guess other\nthan desktop what this computer is called\n\n506\n00:25:06.807 --> 00:25:09.700\nright now,\nas a part of the initial installation.\n\n507\n00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.930\nLet's go ahead and\nshow you where you can do that.\n\n508\n00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:16.420\nAll I have to do is go down\nhere to the taskbar, and\n\n509\n00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:21.290\nwe can right click on the taskbar, and if\nI scroll up, I'm gonna see, well system.\n\n510\n00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.926\nLet me scroll up there a little bit, zoom\nout there, and I'm gonna go to system.\n\n511\n00:25:23.926 --> 00:25:27.990\nAll right well, if I go to system.\n\n512\n00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:31.134\nI knew it would be desktop, I had no clue\nwhat the little string of characters would\n\n513\n00:25:31.134 --> 00:25:33.336\nbe behind it, but\nmaybe that's not what I want, right.\n\n514\n00:25:33.336 --> 00:25:36.881\nMaybe I want it to say home PC,\nmaybe I want to know,\n\n515\n00:25:36.881 --> 00:25:40.763\nhey this is the home PC, or\nmaybe it's laptop, right.\n\n516\n00:25:40.763 --> 00:25:44.481\nWell you can chose rename this PC,\nall right.\n\n517\n00:25:44.481 --> 00:25:46.781\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nwe'll give that a second here,\n\n518\n00:25:46.781 --> 00:25:49.740\nbecause it's doing some things\nin the background there.\n\n519\n00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.660\n&gt;&gt; And literally Wes, you can name\nit whatever you want, is that right?\n\n520\n00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.480\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely\n&gt;&gt; It\n\n521\n00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.920\ndoesn't have to be a string characters or\ncodex.\n\n522\n00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:00.690\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't,\nI could name it Optimus Prime if I want.\n\n523\n00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:01.450\n&gt;&gt; Bob's computer.\n\n524\n00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:02.720\n&gt;&gt; Bob's computer, absolutely.\n\n525\n00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.657\nMaybe this is admin's,\nwe named it admin, right.\n\n526\n00:26:05.657 --> 00:26:09.287\nIt used to be that it would call\nit whatever the user name dash pc,\n\n527\n00:26:09.287 --> 00:26:10.380\nmaybe I want that.\n\n528\n00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.871\nMaybe I wanna say, Admin01.\n\n529\n00:26:13.871 --> 00:26:20.170\nAnd I don't know if it'll like\nthe apostrophe there PC, right?\n\n530\n00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.340\nAnd not too difficult, right?\n\n531\n00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.410\nBut now what I can do is,\nI can choose Next.\n\n532\n00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:29.570\nAnd this is gonna require a restart,\nso just understand that.\n\n533\n00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:31.400\nMake sure that you don't\n\n534\n00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:38.160\nbasically rename your computer in the\nmiddle of downloading a piece of software.\n\n535\n00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.530\nAnd then when it says restart,\nyou restart the computer.\n\n536\n00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:42.610\nIt might corrupt the software.\n\n537\n00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:43.980\nAs far as the Windows Updates go,\n\n538\n00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.570\nI'm not really worried about\nthat because of the fact that\n\n539\n00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:50.480\nwhen Windows Updates are downloading,\nthey stop at a certain stop point.\n\n540\n00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.510\nThat's perfectly fine, and\n\n541\n00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:54.770\nyou could see that it's actually trying\nto install some of them as we speak.\n\n542\n00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.780\nEven if it's just some of the basic ones.\n\n543\n00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.169\nAnd this really honestly\ncould take a little bit, so\n\n544\n00:26:59.169 --> 00:27:01.521\nwe might have to do another\nlittle TV time out here.\n\n545\n00:27:01.521 --> 00:27:02.950\nWe'll see how long it takes here.\n\n546\n00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:07.625\nBut essentially what it's doing\nif you stop the Windows Updates,\n\n547\n00:27:07.625 --> 00:27:10.973\nthat's okay,\nthey stop right where they are.\n\n548\n00:27:10.973 --> 00:27:14.619\nAnd what happens is when your computer\nrestarts, it checks Windows update,\n\n549\n00:27:14.619 --> 00:27:17.312\nit checks what you've got\nstored on the local machine and\n\n550\n00:27:17.312 --> 00:27:19.236\nthen it picks up right where it left off.\n\n551\n00:27:19.236 --> 00:27:22.710\nSo, this can take, sometimes I've\nseen this take a long while.\n\n552\n00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.976\nSo, we'll use one more of those tidy\ntime outs and once our updates are done,\n\n553\n00:27:25.976 --> 00:27:29.680\nwe'll be back And there we go.\n\n554\n00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.990\nSo you can see that it has restarted.\n\n555\n00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:36.420\nAny of the initial updates that\nwere downloaded have gone ahead and\n\n556\n00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:37.150\nthey've installed.\n\n557\n00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:38.870\nNow there are more.\n\n558\n00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:43.050\nKeep in mind that your updates a lot\nof times happen in different stages,\n\n559\n00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:45.040\nbecause sometimes they\nbuild on each other.\n\n560\n00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.020\nBut you can see by looking\nat our screen here,\n\n561\n00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.710\nwe don't have any of the mats anymore.\n\n562\n00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.550\nSo we got the drivers that we need.\n\n563\n00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:53.300\nOne of the last things I wanna\nshow you how to do is maybe\n\n564\n00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.820\nyou need to set up an additional\naccount on this computer, right.\n\n565\n00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:58.270\nMaybe you need to do\na little more customization.\n\n566\n00:27:58.270 --> 00:27:59.770\nSo let's show you how that's done.\n\n567\n00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:03.180\nNow, again, this is one of those things\nwhere it's always in the notification\n\n568\n00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:04.850\narea, and\nmy head is kind of covering it up.\n\n569\n00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:08.429\nBut if we go to the notification area,\nand I say notification area.\n\n570\n00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.450\nIt's actually this little square.\n\n571\n00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:15.040\nThis little thought bubble here is\nwhat's known as the action center.\n\n572\n00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:15.760\nAnd we'll go ahead.\n\n573\n00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.300\nWe'll click on the action center here.\n\n574\n00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:22.240\nAnd we'll give it a chance to open up, oop\nthere it goes, and choose All Settings.\n\n575\n00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.930\nAnd then inside of All Settings, there are\na couple of places that I'm looking at.\n\n576\n00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:30.685\nThe first place that I wanna show\nyou essentially is accounts.\n\n577\n00:28:30.685 --> 00:28:38.230\nNow from here what we're gonna do is,\nnotice there is family and other people.\n\n578\n00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:40.636\nIt says your info, and\nsign in options and stuff.\n\n579\n00:28:40.636 --> 00:28:43.616\nAnd we're gonna do family and\nother people here.\n\n580\n00:28:43.616 --> 00:28:47.792\nAnd here's where it gives you a chance,\nmaybe you decide, you know what,\n\n581\n00:28:47.792 --> 00:28:49.800\nI wanna use a Microsoft account.\n\n582\n00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.680\nWell, you go up, create your\nMicrosoft account, and then you\n\n583\n00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.960\ncan come back in here and you can click\nhere and sign in with a Microsoft account.\n\n584\n00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.540\nSo the choices you made on\nthe initial configuration or\n\n585\n00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.250\ninitial installation,\nthey can be undone, right?\n\n586\n00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.830\nIt's just, hey this is how we\nwanna set it up initially.\n\n587\n00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:05.500\nAnd then you can always\nconfigure it later.\n\n588\n00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.450\nBut what I want is other people, right?\n\n589\n00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.101\nAdd somebody else to this PC.\n\n590\n00:29:11.101 --> 00:29:11.726\nAnd that's what we're gonna do.\n\n591\n00:29:11.726 --> 00:29:17.160\nAll right, now it's gonna ask me if,\ndo I wanna add somebody, right?\n\n592\n00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.680\nDo I wanna add a Microsoft Account here?\n\n593\n00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.670\nI'm gonna say I don't have\nthe person's sign in information here.\n\n594\n00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:24.380\nI'm okay with that.\n\n595\n00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.740\nAnd then what it should do is it should\n\n596\n00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.680\ngive me the ability to add a user\nwithout a Microsoft account.\n\n597\n00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.970\nThey're really pushing on Microsoft\naccount, and I understand why because it\n\n598\n00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:40.000\ngives you the benefit of single sign on,\nI can log in to multiple resources across\n\n599\n00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.130\nMicrosoft's entire infrastructure with the\none account, makes it really convenient.\n\n600\n00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:48.900\nHowever, what I wanna do, maybe I wanna do\nlet's say, I don't know, Child01, right?\n\n601\n00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:52.270\nAnd we'll do our super\nsecret Microsoft password.\n\n602\n00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:57.340\nAnd because I'm creative,\nI'll show you a portion of the password.\n\n603\n00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:03.260\nAll right, and we'll go ahead and\nfrom here we will choose Next.\n\n604\n00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.180\nAll right?\n\n605\n00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.370\nAnd what that does is that gives you,\n\n606\n00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:10.190\nyou can see now that we have\nthat local account, right?\n\n607\n00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:13.977\nAnd from here, if I wanted to,\nI could change the account type,\n\n608\n00:30:13.977 --> 00:30:16.162\nmaybe you are helping somebody out.\n\n609\n00:30:16.162 --> 00:30:19.670\nAnd you wanna give them\nthe ability to install software.\n\n610\n00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:22.550\nAnd you don't wanna have to be the person\nthat's on the phone all the time,\n\n611\n00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:24.660\ntelling him how to do this or\ncoming over and visiting them.\n\n612\n00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.640\nSo maybe you want to.\n\n613\n00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.620\nBy default,\nit signs them a standard user account.\n\n614\n00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.875\nAnd the standard user account cannot\ninstall things like software and\n\n615\n00:30:31.875 --> 00:30:33.925\nthird-party drivers and stuff like that.\n\n616\n00:30:33.925 --> 00:30:36.980\nSo I might wanna change it to\nan Administrator, or maybe not.\n\n617\n00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.060\nMaybe this is a child account, and\n\n618\n00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.590\nyou want them to not be able to do that,\nright?\n\n619\n00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:42.790\nPrincipal of least privileges.\n\n620\n00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:46.580\nOnly give them the access that they need\nto do, whatever it is that they're doing,\n\n621\n00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.120\nno more, no less.\n\n622\n00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:48.902\nAnd we'll choose OK to that.\n\n623\n00:30:48.902 --> 00:30:53.100\nAnd then from here we can\nalways personalize settings.\n\n624\n00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:57.560\nNow right now, I'm not gonna be\ndoing too much personalization.\n\n625\n00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:02.040\nBut from here on out, you could do\nsome personalization here like for\n\n626\n00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.320\ninstance changing your picture and\nyour background.\n\n627\n00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.570\nYou could add your own\nbackground if you want.\n\n628\n00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:10.450\nRight, we can do things like for\ninstance colors.\n\n629\n00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:11.870\nWe could change the colors.\n\n630\n00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:15.630\nThe Lock Screen, Themes, so\na lot of different things we could change.\n\n631\n00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:20.570\nThe Start menu, the Taskbar, so\na lot of different things that you\n\n632\n00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:24.600\ncould do in here when it comes to\npost-installation and configuration.\n\n633\n00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.676\nKeep in mind that these are going\nto be your personalizations,\n\n634\n00:31:27.676 --> 00:31:29.600\nright, so they call it PC for a reason.\n\n635\n00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.310\nIt's personal computer, right?\n\n636\n00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:34.770\nYou personalize your computer\nto what it is that you need.\n\n637\n00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:38.405\nKeep in mind some of the configurations\nthat we've done here because it can make\n\n638\n00:31:38.405 --> 00:31:39.780\nyour life a lot easier.\n\n639\n00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:43.310\nAnd then if you're supporting somebody,\nmake their life easier as well.\n\n640\n00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:46.490\n&gt;&gt; Well Wes I think you've made our\nlives a lot easier, thank you very much.\n\n641\n00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:48.390\nPost OS installation and configuration.\n\n642\n00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:51.900\nGreat episode, there is an awful\nlot to see in PC maintenance.\n\n643\n00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.590\nA lot of episodes, check them all out.\n\n644\n00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.550\nAnd also check out the other\nvideos in our course library.\n\n645\n00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:59.590\nThey're all designed to do one thing,\nhelp you go further.\n\n646\n00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:02.810\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nITPRO.TV, they'll be very glad you did.\n\n647\n00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:04.150\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach

00:00:07.182\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.182 --> 00:00:08.382\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.382 --> 00:00:11.872\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.872 --> 00:00:14.058\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:14.058 --> 00:00:16.677\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n8\n00:00:16.677 --> 00:00:20.420\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with PC Maintenance.\n\n9\n00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.420\nAnd we're gonna be taking a look at\nsomething very interesting today using\n\n10\n00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.130\nWindows file history.\n\n11\n00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.580\nAnd the person we've asked\nto help us out is IT pro and\n\n12\n00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.230\nall around great guy Wes Bryan.\n\n13\n00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.690\nWes, good to have you here, Sir.\n\n14\n00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.050\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back Zach.\n\n15\n00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.600\nThat's right.\n\n16\n00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.840\nWe have been walking through,\n\n17\n00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.140\nwell, a few different episodes starting\nwith one catastrophic failure.\n\n18\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.870\nRight?\nAnd\n\n19\n00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.440\nwhat we mean by that is\na failure of the hardware.\n\n20\n00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.800\nWe looked at replacing a hard\ndrive in other episodes.\n\n21\n00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.150\nWe've looked at installing\nyour operating system,\n\n22\n00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.210\ngetting it back online, and then some of\nthe configurations that you need to do\n\n23\n00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.340\nafter you've reinstalled\nyour operating system.\n\n24\n00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.720\nWell, part of good PC maintenance and\njust general system maintenance.\n\n25\n00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.360\nIt doesn't matter in the PC world.\n\n26\n00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.690\nIf you come from the Mac world,\nthis applies to you.\n\n27\n00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.660\nIf you come from Unix, if you come Linux,\nWindows is making sure\n\n28\n00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.530\nthat the important information, or\nthe information that's important to you,\n\n29\n00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.200\ncuz it's different, right, for\neverybody, is saved in a way that if\n\n30\n00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.715\nthere was a hard drive failure, that\nyou can gain access to it again, right?\n\n31\n00:01:17.715 --> 00:01:22.595\nSo over the next series of episodes in\nthe PC maintenance series in general,\n\n32\n00:01:22.595 --> 00:01:26.115\nI guess I can say over the course of\nthe next few episodes that we're gonna do.\n\n33\n00:01:26.115 --> 00:01:30.360\nWe're gonna look at some of the different\ntechnologies that you could do normal part\n\n34\n00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.020\nof, well, some people call it preventative\nmaintenance which means I prevent\n\n35\n00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.320\nme losing the data, right.\n\n36\n00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.760\nBut it should be considered\npart of system maintenance,\n\n37\n00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.120\nnot preventative maintenance, right.\n\n38\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.640\nWe wanna be proactive,\nnot reactive, right.\n\n39\n00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.620\nWe have to react to certain situations.\n\n40\n00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.257\nBut if we've been proactive then\nthe reaction that we take could\n\n41\n00:01:51.257 --> 00:01:55.880\nmitigate how bad the reaction has to be,\nor\n\n42\n00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.160\nhow horrible of a time it is to be\nbringing that system back online.\n\n43\n00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.969\nSo what we're gonna do here is\nwe're gonna show you, well,\n\n44\n00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.220\na couple of the utilities that\nare actually built right into Windows,\n\n45\n00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.196\nthat first one being file history\n&gt;&gt; What is file history?\n\n46\n00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:12.325\nWhat type of file history\nare we talking about?\n\n47\n00:02:12.325 --> 00:02:14.490\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a great question,\nthere Zach,\n\n48\n00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.295\ngoing back to, let's take a trip back\nin time and let's talk about Windows 7.\n\n49\n00:02:19.295 --> 00:02:23.400\nAll right, well when Windows 7 was out,\nthey had something known as backup and\n\n50\n00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.740\nrecovery, right?\n\n51\n00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.780\nBackup and recovery, by the way,\nis still in Windows today, but\n\n52\n00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.970\nit's tucked away, all right?\n\n53\n00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.340\nAnd what that would allow you to do is it\nwould allow you to select the information\n\n54\n00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.130\nthat you wanted, and you could pick\nthat information you can back it up,\n\n55\n00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.950\nyou can save it to an external drive,\nright?\n\n56\n00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.320\nSo that if something happened\nin your operating system and\n\n57\n00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.050\nyou had to re-install it, you could turn\naround and restore that information.\n\n58\n00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.806\nAll right?\nWell,\n\n59\n00:02:47.806 --> 00:02:50.700\none of the things that we have to\nkeep in mind is that with backup and\n\n60\n00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.530\nhistory it required a little bit of\nknowledge in order to get it set up.\n\n61\n00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.550\nAnd it wasn't so convenient.\n\n62\n00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.560\nAnd it's not bad once you\nunderstand how to use it.\n\n63\n00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.720\nBut some people didn't find that\nit was too intuitive if you will.\n\n64\n00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.880\nSo when Windows 8 came out,\nthey said hey, let's go ahead.\n\n65\n00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.810\nLet's introduce a technology\nthat is really just simplistic\n\n66\n00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.060\npush button technology.\n\n67\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.320\nPoint and click, make it very easy.\n\n68\n00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.030\nThat's essentially what file history is.\n\n69\n00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.290\nIt is something that has replaced the\nbackup and restore even though it's still\n\n70\n00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.160\nthere as a simple way to\nback up your files, right.\n\n71\n00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.500\nNow, be careful with this one, right.\n\n72\n00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.780\nWe're not talking about backing\nup your operating system.\n\n73\n00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.638\nAll right.\nSee backup and\n\n74\n00:03:35.638 --> 00:03:37.784\nrestore would also back\nup your operating system.\n\n75\n00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:42.311\n[CROSSTALK] But a lot of times what\nhappens is today there's factory reset, or\n\n76\n00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:44.900\nfactory recovery partitions on machines.\n\n77\n00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.201\nMake a really easy push button reset.\n\n78\n00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:51.301\nYou boot into this partition and\nreinstalls your operating system and\n\n79\n00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:53.990\nyou're ready to go, minus your files.\n\n80\n00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.150\nSo what they found is that hey with\nthe commonality of the factory recovery\n\n81\n00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.110\npartition there why are we gonna keep\nusing the keep using the clunky back\n\n82\n00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.630\nup and restore?\n\n83\n00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.280\nI actually like it so\nI'm picking on it a little bit.\n\n84\n00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.350\nWhy are we gonna use\nthe clunky back up and\n\n85\n00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.870\nrestore that backs up everything\nincluding your operating system\n\n86\n00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.120\nwhen I've got this factory recovery\npartition already on the machine?\n\n87\n00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.830\nSo that was probably\nwhat their binds at was.\n\n88\n00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.060\nIf you could already reinstall your\noperating system just by one click, well,\n\n89\n00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.720\nthen what is it that I\nreally need to restore?\n\n90\n00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.830\nWell, I just need an interface\nthat makes it very,\n\n91\n00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.490\nvery simplistic to back my files up.\n\n92\n00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.270\nAnd that restore those files as well.\n\n93\n00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.210\nSo that's what file history is.\n\n94\n00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.540\nSo let's go ahead and let's show you.\n\n95\n00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.840\nI've got a Windows 10 machine here and\nunderstand that these same\n\n96\n00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.590\nsteps would apply for you users out there\nthat have Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.\n\n97\n00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.361\nSo that's the great thing.\n\n98\n00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:45.988\nYou learn how to set this up\non one of those machines.\n\n99\n00:04:45.988 --> 00:04:48.850\nYou're gonna be able to set it up through\nour all of those operating systems.\n\n100\n00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.180\nWindows 8, 8.1 and Windows 10.\n\n101\n00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.860\nSo, if we go ahead and\nwe drop down to our,\n\n102\n00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.340\nthere's couple of different\nways that we can do this.\n\n103\n00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.360\nWe go to the action center.\n\n104\n00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.880\nIn fact,\nthat's where I'm gonna start right now and\n\n105\n00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.100\nthe action center is so,\nit's tucked away right?\n\n106\n00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.060\nThat little notification\nbubble right there.\n\n107\n00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.380\nIf I go to that and\nthen I choose All settings.\n\n108\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.600\nAll right.\nAnd this brings me up to my\n\n109\n00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.180\nWindows Settings.\n\n110\n00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.080\nNow, all right?\n\n111\n00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.940\nAnd then, what I'm looking for is the same\nplace that we showed you another episodes\n\n112\n00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.330\non how to do post\ninstallation configuration.\n\n113\n00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.590\nHow to do your windows updates.\n\n114\n00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.121\nThis is what I'm looking for right?\n\n115\n00:05:23.121 --> 00:05:27.585\nUpdates and security, now, notice\nthat it's telling me, we gotta look,\n\n116\n00:05:27.585 --> 00:05:32.237\napparently I still have to finish\nthe update process here, too.\n\n117\n00:05:32.237 --> 00:05:35.007\n&gt;&gt; And we'll do that off camera so\nI don't have to bug you guys and\n\n118\n00:05:35.007 --> 00:05:36.190\ngals out there with that.\n\n119\n00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.050\nBut what I'm looking at is notice we\nhave a series of options here, right?\n\n120\n00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.610\nWe've got Windows Update,\nWindows Defender, and Backup.\n\n121\n00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.120\nAll right, now when I go to Backup,\nI've got a couple of options, right?\n\n122\n00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.590\nNotice I said go to Backup and Restore?\n\n123\n00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.700\nThey kept it around because\nsome people like myself,\n\n124\n00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.530\neven though it seems like I'm picking\non it, I really like this software.\n\n125\n00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.060\nIt really makes system imaging easy, and\n\n126\n00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.920\nwe're gonna talk about that in\na later episode, not in this episode.\n\n127\n00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.300\nWe'll show you a step by step\non how to create a backup image,\n\n128\n00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.090\nsimulate a failure, and\nhow to restore that image so you're up and\n\n129\n00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.160\nrunning again, but\nwe'll do that in another episode.\n\n130\n00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.700\n&gt;&gt; It says Windows 7, Wes.\n\n131\n00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.810\nIs that the version that it is or?\n\n132\n00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.450\n&gt;&gt; They kept that because\na lot of people didn't know\n\n133\n00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:19.870\nit was called Backup and Restore.\n\n134\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.940\nSo they just kind of branded this.\n\n135\n00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.940\nIt's the same interface and\nthey said Windows 7 so\n\n136\n00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.640\nif people that moved into Windows 8 and\nit was gone because they took it out,\n\n137\n00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.200\nyou'll know what it is,\nwhere it came from.\n\n138\n00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.320\nIf you're familiar with Windows 7,\nyou'll be familiar with it here.\n\n139\n00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.810\nAnd that's why they named it there.\n\n140\n00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.920\nSo, Back up using File History,\nthat's what we need, all right?\n\n141\n00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.540\nSo it says Add a drive.\n\n142\n00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.461\nI'll go ahead and I'll click that,\nand it is searching for drives.\n\n143\n00:06:45.461 --> 00:06:48.052\nAnd one of the things\nthat it's not gonna find.\n\n144\n00:06:48.052 --> 00:06:51.250\nIt isn't going to find No\nusable drives found, right?\n\n145\n00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.623\nThat's cause I have to\nplug in a USB drive.\n\n146\n00:06:53.623 --> 00:06:57.547\nAll right, now you can use any\nkind of external USB device.\n\n147\n00:06:57.547 --> 00:07:00.390\nI just happen to have a 64\ngig little thumb drive here.\n\n148\n00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:05.930\nKeep in mind your files depending on\nhow big the files are especially if you\n\n149\n00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.990\nlike movies or you like high definition\nvideo, they can get sizeable really quick.\n\n150\n00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.460\nSo just pay attention to whatever\nthe size of the drive is, you might find\n\n151\n00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.290\nthe passports will work as well, but any\nexternal USB drive will work really well.\n\n152\n00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.450\nSo what I'm gonna do, as I'll just\ngo ahead and take a second here, and\n\n153\n00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.350\nwe'll plug this in.\n\n154\n00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.519\nAnd then, one of the things that\nit should do, here in a second,\n\n155\n00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:29.310\nis we should be able to\npush that button again.\n\n156\n00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.740\nAnd what it'll do is it'll\nrecognize that drive.\n\n157\n00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.710\nIn fact, well, let's go ahead.\n\n158\n00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.000\nAnd if we could take a look at my\ncomputer, I plugged that drive in.\n\n159\n00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.390\nAnd even though I still had\nthis interface open but\n\n160\n00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.240\nI didn't click it, it found it right away.\n\n161\n00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.205\nIt reopened the dialog box and\nit says, hey, I found here.\n\n162\n00:07:44.205 --> 00:07:45.233\n&gt;&gt; I've got a drive for you.\n\n163\n00:07:45.233 --> 00:07:49.344\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nnow notice it says 27 GB free of 31 GB.\n\n164\n00:07:49.344 --> 00:07:50.536\nActually, it's a 32 GB.\n\n165\n00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:53.502\nI thought this was a 64 GB,\nbut neither here nor there.\n\n166\n00:07:53.502 --> 00:07:55.933\nAll right, so.\n\n167\n00:07:55.933 --> 00:07:59.032\nI'm gonna give you a warning,\nuse this for file history,\n\n168\n00:07:59.032 --> 00:08:02.650\nmake sure that you take any of the data\nthat you don't want off of it.\n\n169\n00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.310\nIn fact, we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna format it,\n\n170\n00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:08.360\nbecause this is going to be my\ndedicated backup drive, all right.\n\n171\n00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.130\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ndrop down to File Explorer.\n\n172\n00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:16.780\nNotice that I have, this is\nRage Extreme Patriot memory device.\n\n173\n00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:20.275\nI love that, their little tag right there,\nit says RAGEXT.\n\n174\n00:08:20.275 --> 00:08:24.970\n[LAUGH] But\nthat actually just means Rage Extreme.\n\n175\n00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.445\nI guess that makes it faster,\ncuz they got Extreme on the end.\n\n176\n00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:28.355\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n177\n00:08:28.355 --> 00:08:32.082\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So what we're gonna do,\nyou got that?\n\n178\n00:08:32.082 --> 00:08:34.680\nIs we're gonna right-click on it,\nwe're gonna choose Format.\n\n179\n00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.442\nAll right.\n\n180\n00:08:35.442 --> 00:08:38.514\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead, and\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\n\n181\n00:08:38.514 --> 00:08:43.420\nchoose the default file system for Windows\nNTFS, and I'll leave everything normal.\n\n182\n00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.070\nYou can rename the volume label,\nif you want.\n\n183\n00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:50.840\nI might wanna do something like,\nmaybe I'd call it FileHistory.\n\n184\n00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.667\nYou could do that, if you want.\n\n185\n00:08:51.667 --> 00:08:54.525\nBut this is gonna be my dedicated file,\nHistory Drive.\n\n186\n00:08:54.525 --> 00:08:56.653\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and choose start.\n\n187\n00:08:56.653 --> 00:09:00.660\nNotice, it's telling me in the formatting,\nerase all the information.\n\n188\n00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.580\nSo be careful on this one, cuz if you've\ngot information on there that you\n\n189\n00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.150\ncan't afford to lose, sorry, it is gone.\n\n190\n00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.233\nAll right, so\njust know that ahead of time.\n\n191\n00:09:09.233 --> 00:09:11.842\nAnd it doesn't take too long, and\nit should go ahead and format.\n\n192\n00:09:11.842 --> 00:09:16.230\nIt's gonna re-assign a drive label to it,\nand we should be okay.\n\n193\n00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.970\nAnd I'll go ahead and close this down.\n\n194\n00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.390\nAnd now we have our nice,\n\n195\n00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:23.870\nbrand new FileHistory drive ready to\ngo that we can work with File History.\n\n196\n00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.690\nAll right.\nAnd we'll go ahead and close that down,\n\n197\n00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.980\nand we'll choose Add a new drive.\n\n198\n00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.780\nAnd you know what?\n\n199\n00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.160\nLet me do something.\n\n200\n00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.932\nIt might be still seeing the old cache and\nthe old settings, so\n\n201\n00:09:33.932 --> 00:09:36.188\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nclose Action Center down.\n\n202\n00:09:36.188 --> 00:09:40.553\nAnd I want to just kinda\nreopen that just to make sure,\n\n203\n00:09:40.553 --> 00:09:44.695\nI'm not sure that it really matters,\nbut just in case.\n\n204\n00:09:44.695 --> 00:09:48.990\nNow it kinda requeries the system here,\nand we choose Add drive.\n\n205\n00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.859\nAnd it is, yes, it's researching for those\ndrives, and now it sees it, it updates.\n\n206\n00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:57.240\nI just don't want any remnants of anything\nleft behind, and it cause problems, right?\n\n207\n00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.960\nSo now I have a 32GB drive.\n\n208\n00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.580\nIt's 31 gigs with NTFS overhead.\n\n209\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.020\nThat's what I want, all right.\n\n210\n00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.170\nSo we'll go ahead, and\nwe'll let that continue here.\n\n211\n00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:10.700\nAnd what it's gonna do is it should\nshow us a wizard here in a second,\n\n212\n00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.240\nthat it's gonna open up.\n\n213\n00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.030\nAnd now, what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna a little bit farther.\n\n214\n00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.787\nNow, there are other options that we're\ngonna look at here in a bit once this\n\n215\n00:10:18.787 --> 00:10:21.940\ncomes up, Cuz we got some updates\ngoing on in the background here.\n\n216\n00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.412\nAnd it looks like it closed down.\n\n217\n00:10:23.412 --> 00:10:25.190\nI probably shouldn't\nhave closed that down.\n\n218\n00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.010\nLet's try that again.\n\n219\n00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.820\nAll right, just a bit outside, ball one.\n\n220\n00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.620\n&gt;&gt; Go ahead and choose Backup here,\nand we'll try that one more time.\n\n221\n00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:38.410\nWe'll add that drive, there we go,\nthat's what we wanted, and there we go.\n\n222\n00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.630\nAlright, now notice it tells me,\nAutomatically back up my files.\n\n223\n00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.140\nNot much to it, was it?\n\n224\n00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:45.810\nRight?\n\n225\n00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:49.072\nBut you have to know what those\nadditional options are, so\n\n226\n00:10:49.072 --> 00:10:51.544\nmake sure you are configuring it properly.\n\n227\n00:10:51.544 --> 00:10:54.208\nSo let's go ahead, and let's look at\nsome of those additional options, right.\n\n228\n00:10:54.208 --> 00:10:57.370\nSo the backup options that\nwe have with FileHistory.\n\n229\n00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:57.870\nAll right.\n\n230\n00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:03.370\nNotice, it says backing up your data,\nwell, how often is it gonna back it up?\n\n231\n00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.830\nIt's gonna back it up every hour, right.\n\n232\n00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:10.460\nWell, we could change how often it saves\nyour crucial information to that drive,\n\n233\n00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:11.680\nthat's up to you.\n\n234\n00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.490\nRight?\nIf you're one of these ones that maybe\n\n235\n00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.510\ndoes a lot of work on your machine daily,\nmaybe you want it by hour.\n\n236\n00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.440\nEvery hour, you wanted to reach out,\ngrab those important files, and\n\n237\n00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.740\nsave it to the external drive.\n\n238\n00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.555\nSo it's kinda like your Ctrl+S, right?\n\n239\n00:11:25.555 --> 00:11:27.120\nCtrl+S is your friend, right?\n\n240\n00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.832\nCtrl+S saves your documents, right.\n\n241\n00:11:28.832 --> 00:11:32.130\nWell, this is like the Ctrl+S for\nyour personal files.\n\n242\n00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:37.350\nYou could do this daily, if you want, once\nevery 24 hours, that is really up to you.\n\n243\n00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:41.680\nMe, personally, I find every hour\nmight be a little bit too much.\n\n244\n00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.280\nAgain, personal computing, so\nyou can change it to what you want.\n\n245\n00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.890\nI do it every 6 hours, cuz it means that\nfor me, it's kinda like the 9 o'clock hour\n\n246\n00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.700\ninto my work day and\nthen at the end of the day as well, right?\n\n247\n00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.923\nSo you kinda get two of those saved for\nme, as far as the work day goes.\n\n248\n00:11:55.923 --> 00:11:57.943\nNow, it's interesting.\n\n249\n00:11:57.943 --> 00:12:02.884\nThe next thing that we have\nare the Backup folders, right, or\n\n250\n00:12:02.884 --> 00:12:06.580\nhow long do we retain those backups?\n\n251\n00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.969\nWell, forever is by default, all right.\n\n252\n00:12:08.969 --> 00:12:11.734\nNow, understand that you can change this,\n\n253\n00:12:11.734 --> 00:12:17.117\nbecause if you were backing up information\nevery hour, right, every 30 minutes,\n\n254\n00:12:17.117 --> 00:12:22.210\nright, You could accrue a lot of\ninformation on this backup drive, right?\n\n255\n00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.180\nIf you've got a terabyte\nexternal USB drive,\n\n256\n00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.770\nthis might not matter to you, right?\n\n257\n00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.580\nBut it could, right?\n\n258\n00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.070\nAnd that's one of the things that\nyou just have to keep in mind.\n\n259\n00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.120\nI'm gonna go ahead.\n\n260\n00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.860\nI'll just say, hey,\nkeep the backups forever.\n\n261\n00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.590\nIf you think that you might be\nlimited in space, you can just say,\n\n262\n00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:40.150\nuntil space is needed.\n\n263\n00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.360\nAnd then what it does is as it\nstarts to accrue that drive space,\n\n264\n00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.250\nit'll start to get rid of\nthe oldest backups, right.\n\n265\n00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:49.570\nAnd then make new ones, get rid,\npurge the old, in with the new, right.\n\n266\n00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.044\nKinda like a FIFO,\nfirst in, first out, right.\n\n267\n00:12:53.044 --> 00:12:54.732\nAll right, so we could change that.\n\n268\n00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:56.670\nI'm not gonna change that at all.\n\n269\n00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.428\nYou can see that in the background,\nit's still backing up my information for\n\n270\n00:12:59.428 --> 00:13:00.029\nthe first time.\n\n271\n00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:02.755\nThat's one of the great things,\nsee, this is simplistic, right.\n\n272\n00:13:02.755 --> 00:13:04.290\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n&gt;&gt; It's not that difficult,\n\n273\n00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.090\nall I had to do was click Add the drive.\n\n274\n00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.790\nWe formatted the drive,\nshowed you how to do that, and\n\n275\n00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.810\nthen it started going by default,\nit started backing up my information.\n\n276\n00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.890\nNow, what is it backing up?\n\n277\n00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:16.170\nAll right, well let's look.\n\n278\n00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.030\nAll right,\nit backs up what are known as libraries.\n\n279\n00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:22.290\nAll right, and\nthese are all of my important locations.\n\n280\n00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.750\nNotice any games I have saved,\nright, any links I have saved,\n\n281\n00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.100\nwhich is really nice, downloads.\n\n282\n00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.330\nAnd this is really, if you'll look,\n\n283\n00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:37.040\nsome of these areas that we see are the\nsame areas that you see right here, right?\n\n284\n00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.410\nNotice I have Downloads.\n\n285\n00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:42.437\nWell if I look over here to our\nFile History, I see Downloads,\n\n286\n00:13:42.437 --> 00:13:46.705\nI see Favorites, Contacts,\nDesktop, Pictures, Documents.\n\n287\n00:13:46.705 --> 00:13:50.000\nWell, what I see in File Explorer, right.\n\n288\n00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.770\nSo you can see some of the commonalities,\nright?\n\n289\n00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.900\nThese are the frequently used folders and\n\n290\n00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.930\nthat's what by default,\nFile History is gonna take.\n\n291\n00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.300\nAnd then some, not just that, right?\n\n292\n00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.040\nIt's nice that what happens\nif your computer is gone.\n\n293\n00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.350\nI mean, I don't know about you Zach.\n\n294\n00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.710\nSo let me give you a worst\ncase scenario for this, right?\n\n295\n00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:13.042\nSo, Zach, have you ever had where\nyou completely reset your phone, and\n\n296\n00:14:13.042 --> 00:14:16.620\nyou lose all your contacts, And\nyou have to, man, I gotta go,\n\n297\n00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.680\nI don't even know what their number is.\n\n298\n00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.000\nI always use contact.\n\n299\n00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.210\nI just press that button.\n\n300\n00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.138\nNow, you gotta find out what-\n&gt;&gt; I do that with my own phone number.\n\n301\n00:14:23.138 --> 00:14:24.190\n&gt;&gt; Same here.\n\n302\n00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.200\nYou're not the only one.\n\n303\n00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.570\nSo I'm on that bandwagon with you.\n\n304\n00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:30.098\nSo wouldn't that be nice that if something\ndoes go wrong with your operating system,\n\n305\n00:14:30.098 --> 00:14:34.542\nAnd you have to do that factory reset into\nthe factory recovery partition like we\n\n306\n00:14:34.542 --> 00:14:35.930\nsaid initially.\n\n307\n00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:39.898\nNow, I can pull up my contacts back, and I\ndon't have to remember telephone numbers.\n\n308\n00:14:39.898 --> 00:14:41.153\nBoy, that's a personal problem,\nI tell you.\n\n309\n00:14:41.153 --> 00:14:42.445\n&gt;&gt; That's great, that's great.\n\n310\n00:14:42.445 --> 00:14:44.485\nIn fact I was going to ask\nyou something too, Wes.\n\n311\n00:14:44.485 --> 00:14:47.065\nSo, let's say you did set it for\nevery hour.\n\n312\n00:14:47.065 --> 00:14:48.175\nAnd let's say today,\n\n313\n00:14:48.175 --> 00:14:51.475\nthis hour, you've added something\nto a file that you're working on.\n\n314\n00:14:52.945 --> 00:14:54.853\nAnd then it saves that an hour later.\n\n315\n00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:58.380\nSo it's gonna save the iteration\nof that file that I was working on\n\n316\n00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.400\nthree hours ago, yesterday.\n\n317\n00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.780\nI can see where that went\nright up after a time.\n\n318\n00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.150\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, it would.\n\n319\n00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.078\nAnd it uses versioning, right?\n\n320\n00:15:06.078 --> 00:15:07.808\nAnd that's a great question too,\n\n321\n00:15:07.808 --> 00:15:11.400\nbecause there might be a change that\nyou make to a document, all right?\n\n322\n00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.410\nI don't know how many times,\nmaybe you've done this before, Zach,\n\n323\n00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.500\nWhen you're working, let's say,\non Excel Spreadsheet.\n\n324\n00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.720\nMaybe you're working on a Word document,\nright?\n\n325\n00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.277\nMaybe a PowerPoint presentation and\nyou accidentally delete everything.\n\n326\n00:15:21.277 --> 00:15:26.780\nAll right, boy, wouldn't it be great\nto get back what I did an hour ago?\n\n327\n00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.760\nWell, I can restore it with File History.\n\n328\n00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.669\nAnd that's why it's called File History,\nright.\n\n329\n00:15:31.669 --> 00:15:34.130\nSo it does save iterations.\n\n330\n00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:35.513\nSo, great question there.\n\n331\n00:15:35.513 --> 00:15:38.574\nYou could say,\nyou can also do exclusions, too, right.\n\n332\n00:15:38.574 --> 00:15:41.268\nSo if I wanna exclude certain folders,\n\n333\n00:15:41.268 --> 00:15:45.500\nmaybe I don't even use this\ncomputer at all for music.\n\n334\n00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.560\nWell, there's no reason\nto have it in the list.\n\n335\n00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.911\nIf I want to exclude, I can also\ndo exclusions too, which is nice.\n\n336\n00:15:50.911 --> 00:15:56.140\nIf I say hey, you know, this 32GB drive\nman, I probably should have gone with\n\n337\n00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:01.623\na couple hundred GBs, easy, I've Which\nis small by today's day and age anyways.\n\n338\n00:16:01.623 --> 00:16:03.620\nMaybe I wanna go to that\none terabyte drive.\n\n339\n00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.420\nWell, the great thing is,\n\n340\n00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.710\nthe moment I plug this drive in,\nfile history recognizes it.\n\n341\n00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.570\nThat's why I wanted to make sure in\nthe initial setup that it didn't have\n\n342\n00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.050\nremnants of that information.\n\n343\n00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.530\nBecause if you use that drive, it\nrecognizes it the moment you plug it in,\n\n344\n00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.590\nand file history goes to\nbacking up your information.\n\n345\n00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.730\nSo you wanna make sure that\ninitial setup is right.\n\n346\n00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.410\nWell what if I don't wanna use that drive?\n\n347\n00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:25.620\nWell right here right I could stop using\nthe drive and I could turn around and\n\n348\n00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.860\nset up an additional drive right?\n\n349\n00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.320\nThere are other advanced settings\nthat you could set too if you wanted.\n\n350\n00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.150\nAnd this takes us to\nthe old control panel.\n\n351\n00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.870\nAnd this again are just exclude, restore,\n\n352\n00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.630\nthis is where you can do\nyour restoration as well.\n\n353\n00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:44.430\nOr I could turn it off or\nI could initiate an initial run.\n\n354\n00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.440\nSo, let's go ahead and\nkinda show you what that looks like.\n\n355\n00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.182\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nwhat I'll do is that I'll close down,\n\n356\n00:16:49.182 --> 00:16:50.456\nminimize this for a second.\n\n357\n00:16:50.456 --> 00:16:53.460\nWe're gonna go into,\nwe are going to downloads.\n\n358\n00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:03.120\nAnd I have downloaded my Important Doc.\n\n359\n00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.245\nNow you have to make sure\nthat you're running this and\n\n360\n00:17:06.245 --> 00:17:09.311\nI think it might have saved by now,\nall right, yes.\n\n361\n00:17:09.311 --> 00:17:14.020\nSo it let's me know when\nthe last back up is right?\n\n362\n00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.940\nSo I can say let's back up now, and\nthen it's gonna go through the process and\n\n363\n00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.705\nthen it's gonna back up the data.\n\n364\n00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:21.065\nBoy, that was quick right?\n\n365\n00:17:21.065 --> 00:17:22.790\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; Once that it set's up\n\n366\n00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.490\nthe initial back up it isn't that bad.\n\n367\n00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:31.990\nAnd then I do text in doc.\n\n368\n00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:36.530\nWe save that, and I back it up again.\n\n369\n00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:37.320\nSo now it's backed up.\n\n370\n00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.080\nWe'll let it go ahead and\nit'll finish the backup.\n\n371\n00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:47.930\nAnd what I'm gonna do here is I\nam going to delete the document.\n\n372\n00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:50.225\nNow, let's do this with no smoke and\nmirrors.\n\n373\n00:17:50.225 --> 00:17:51.760\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So it's in the Recycle Bin and\n\n374\n00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.270\ntechnically I could restore it from\nthis Recycle Bin and say haha,\n\n375\n00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.090\nfile history worked.\n\n376\n00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.080\nWell that wouldn't be actually doing\nyou any justice, our viewers, at all.\n\n377\n00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.040\nSo let's go ahead, what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna empty the Recycle Bin.\n\n378\n00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.120\nNow the next thing I'm\ngonna do is we're gonna go\n\n379\n00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:14.520\nback to file history here\nin our actions center.\n\n380\n00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:20.340\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go\nto restore files from current backup.\n\n381\n00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.260\nWe'll go ahead and click that.\n\n382\n00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.918\nAnd it should bring up their\nfile history restoration page.\n\n383\n00:18:27.918 --> 00:18:31.910\nNow, here are the current\nbackups that it has.\n\n384\n00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:36.810\nSo, at this point what I could do\nis I could say restore everything.\n\n385\n00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:39.710\nBut remember I also had that\ndownloads folder there too\n\n386\n00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.370\nwith the important document right there.\n\n387\n00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:46.300\nSo, I could say you know what,\nI don't need to restore everything and\n\n388\n00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.790\nyou'll notice that it\nhas a couple of copies.\n\n389\n00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:50.525\nRemember what you said?\n\n390\n00:18:50.525 --> 00:18:51.782\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, point in time copy?\n\n391\n00:18:51.782 --> 00:18:52.290\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n392\n00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:58.035\n&gt;&gt; So it notices that it says, hey,\nwhen I took the backup at 10 or\n\n393\n00:18:58.035 --> 00:19:00.290\n11:10 AM, this folder was empty.\n\n394\n00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.850\nYou remember the initial\nsetup we did there, Zach?\n\n395\n00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.670\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; I didn't have a document in there, so\n\n396\n00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.880\nit carry the snapshot over a backup and\nit said,\n\n397\n00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.990\nI didn't see anything in this folder.\n\n398\n00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.630\nBut then we created our\nimportant document and\n\n399\n00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:14.770\nthere it is\n&gt;&gt; Bing, bing, bing\n\n400\n00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:15.760\n&gt;&gt; But it didn't have the text\n\n401\n00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:16.290\nI wanted in it.\n\n402\n00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.710\nSo let's say an hour goes by and\nI'm making modifications to this and\n\n403\n00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:22.510\nit runs again.\n\n404\n00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.630\nWell, now there's the second iteration.\n\n405\n00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:29.330\nSecond copy, the version of\nthat file that I could restore.\n\n406\n00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.500\nSo how hard is it to restore?\n\n407\n00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.820\nSelect the file And look.\n\n408\n00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:44.690\nIt opened up File Explorer and\nit put it in the original location.\n\n409\n00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.790\nSo it puts it right back to\nwhere it was to begin with.\n\n410\n00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:49.790\nIt's a great thing right?\n\n411\n00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.680\nSo it's not really hard to\nuse once you have it set up.\n\n412\n00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.545\nNow, you could go a little\nbit further than this.\n\n413\n00:19:55.545 --> 00:20:00.420\nAnd what I could do is, I'm gonna really,\nreally, flex the muscles.\n\n414\n00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.400\nI'm part of history today.\n\n415\n00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.400\nI'm gonna and close this down here.\n\n416\n00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.560\nWe'll minimize this.\n\n417\n00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.440\nNo rabbit in the hat.\n\n418\n00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.700\nNo cards up the sleeves here.\n\n419\n00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.690\nWe'll go ahead and delete it.\n\n420\n00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:13.230\nZack, drum roll.\n\n421\n00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:14.413\nIs that folder empty or not?\n\n422\n00:20:14.413 --> 00:20:16.450\n&gt;&gt; [NOISE]\n&gt;&gt; Is it empty?\n\n423\n00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:17.520\nDoes that folder say empty?\n\n424\n00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.110\n&gt;&gt; It says empty.\n\n425\n00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nSo the recycling bin,\n\n426\n00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:23.420\nwe don't have what we want, it is gone.\n\n427\n00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.860\nNow we're gonna go ahead and\nrestore files from current backup.\n\n428\n00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.670\nAnd notice that, let's see here.\n\n429\n00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:33.320\nWe'll get into Downloads.\n\n430\n00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.420\nAnd we've got this file.\n\n431\n00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.380\nAnd it is selected there.\n\n432\n00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.290\nNow there are a couple other settings.\n\n433\n00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:41.990\nNotice this is the Restore to.\n\n434\n00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:45.210\nNow, let me kind of preface this.\n\n435\n00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.990\nThis is your restore button.\n\n436\n00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:52.857\nThis is an action menu that would allow\nyou the text version of that little icon.\n\n437\n00:20:52.857 --> 00:20:55.910\nBut what if it's in Downloads,\nand I'm like, downloads?\n\n438\n00:20:55.910 --> 00:21:01.210\nI don't store my documents in downloads,\nI store my documents in Documents.\n\n439\n00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:02.410\nWell, do restore too.\n\n440\n00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.270\nAnd notice,\nthis just happens to work out perfect,\n\n441\n00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.300\nbecause I didn't need to set anything.\n\n442\n00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.290\nI didn't mean to do that.\n\n443\n00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:13.450\nBut I could change where\nI want it restored.\n\n444\n00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:15.710\nAnd in this case,\nI want it restored to Documents.\n\n445\n00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:16.880\nSo I select the folder.\n\n446\n00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.230\nAnd there it is.\n\n447\n00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.540\nIt goes to an alternate location as well.\n\n448\n00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.020\nSo this is a very very\ngood utility to have.\n\n449\n00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.290\nIt doesn't take a lot\nof the advanced setup.\n\n450\n00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:30.445\nMore.\nMore advance set up,\n\n451\n00:21:30.445 --> 00:21:34.005\nif you will,\nlike the all Windows backup and restore.\n\n452\n00:21:34.005 --> 00:21:35.685\nI love back up and restore.\n\n453\n00:21:35.685 --> 00:21:38.575\nAnd we are gonna show you on other\nepisodes how you can use that because\n\n454\n00:21:38.575 --> 00:21:42.595\nthere is one feature that that does,\nthat this doesn't even come close.\n\n455\n00:21:42.595 --> 00:21:47.495\nIt restores an entire bit by bit\ncopy of your entire hard drive.\n\n456\n00:21:47.495 --> 00:21:49.195\nIt creates what's know us a system image.\n\n457\n00:21:49.195 --> 00:21:53.240\nAnd then also allows you to\ncreate a system repair disk.\n\n458\n00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.630\nAnd again, because of the fact that\nfactory partitions today come with your\n\n459\n00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:00.910\nmachines, so\nthat I can just boot in to that partition,\n\n460\n00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.530\nit restores my entire operating\nsystem minus my files.\n\n461\n00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.840\nFile history is two pieces\nof the puzzle there.\n\n462\n00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.290\nIt allows you to pull that information\non the drive that you've saved it.\n\n463\n00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:14.180\nAnd great question earlier by Zach.\n\n464\n00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.000\nAnd I wanna just kinda reiterate cause\nthis is the other thing that's kinda more\n\n465\n00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.930\npowerful about file history.\n\n466\n00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:23.890\nThat backup and restore doesn't do,\nit does versionings file history.\n\n467\n00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:27.600\nSo it keeps a running track of the history\nof that file that's in those libraries.\n\n468\n00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.905\nNow, that's the other thing,\n\n469\n00:22:28.905 --> 00:22:31.284\nif they're not in those\nlibraries they don't get saved.\n\n470\n00:22:31.284 --> 00:22:33.658\nSo if you make modifications and\nyou say, you know what,\n\n471\n00:22:33.658 --> 00:22:36.886\nthe only place I store my files is in\ndocuments, and I just picked documents.\n\n472\n00:22:36.886 --> 00:22:41.687\nBut Wes saved that file in downloads,\nbut you excluded the folder sorry,\n\n473\n00:22:41.687 --> 00:22:43.940\nit's not gonna maintain copies.\n\n474\n00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:50.300\nBut it's also nice that if you do\nmake an unwanted change to a document\n\n475\n00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.890\nthat you've been working on, like Zach\nsaid, maybe an hour, two hours later, and\n\n476\n00:22:54.890 --> 00:23:00.120\nI've added data or maybe deleted data and\nI wanna gain access to that again.\n\n477\n00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.420\nWell guess what if you're running\nit every hour you're gonna have it.\n\n478\n00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.880\nAll you have to do is the same thing that\nwe've done here just by selecting through\n\n479\n00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.890\nthe arrow button which version of that\nfile was that you wanted to restore and\n\n480\n00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.000\nyou can do it just like that.\n\n481\n00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.360\nYou can do it to the originally location,\nor customize and\n\n482\n00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.270\ntailor make it to your needs just by\nrestoring it to an alternate location.\n\n483\n00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:23.140\nSo a very, very great utility to have,\nyou just gotta know how to use it.\n\n484\n00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.340\n&gt;&gt; Options, options, options.\n\n485\n00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.270\nAnd Wes thanks for bringing up\nall those different options too.\n\n486\n00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.060\nSo using Windows file history, good stuff.\n\n487\n00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:30.850\nYou should check it out.\n\n488\n00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.690\nAnd then check out all\nthe episodes of PC Maintenance.\n\n489\n00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:36.460\nAnd while you're at it check\nout our entire course library.\n\n490\n00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.010\nThere's hundreds of videos there.\n\n491\n00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.270\nThey're all designed to\nhelp you go further.\n\n492\n00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.770\nAnd tell know about ITPRO.TV.\n\n493\n00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.400\nThey'll be very glad you did.\n\n494\n00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.110\nThanks for watching.\n\n495\n00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.950\nI'm Zack

00:00:12.350\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.690\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for choosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.770\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with PC maintenance.\n\n6\n00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.520\nAnd we're gonna be backing\nup with Windows backup and\n\n7\n00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.690\nrestore with the one and only Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.770\nWes, great to have you here,\nthanks for helping us out.\n\n9\n00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.640\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yep,\nthis is moving along in our series, here.\n\n10\n00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.710\nAnother series, we've looked at what\nyou can do when you have a failed\n\n11\n00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.700\nhard drive and\nhow to get a new hard drive reinstalled.\n\n12\n00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.570\nI've also showed you things like, well for\ninstance, how to get the operating\n\n13\n00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.440\nsystem reinstalled, and some of\nthe post configurations you need to do.\n\n14\n00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.660\nNow, we've also talked about\nthings like file History, right?\n\n15\n00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.055\nFile History was or is a piece of software\nthat allows you to keep copies of\n\n16\n00:00:51.055 --> 00:00:53.365\nyour data so that should you make,\n\n17\n00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:58.465\nlet's say, modifications to that document,\nshould you delete the document or\n\n18\n00:00:58.465 --> 00:01:01.885\nshould you lose the document altogether,\nthat you can restore it.\n\n19\n00:01:01.885 --> 00:01:05.545\nBut the limitation of file history\nis the fact that it does nothing to\n\n20\n00:01:05.545 --> 00:01:08.455\nhelp you restore your operating\nsystem should you need to.\n\n21\n00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.860\nSo in this episode what we're gonna talk\nabout is not only how to backup your own\n\n22\n00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.540\ndata like you can with file history, but\ngoing a little bit farther than this and\n\n23\n00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.920\nactually being able to back up the system.\n\n24\n00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.220\nNow, how much you backup is really going\nto be up to you when it comes to keeping\n\n25\n00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.290\ncopies of the crucial files including\nyours and the system's files.\n\n26\n00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.520\nSo we're gonna use a utility that's been\naround since, well really since Windows 7.\n\n27\n00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.590\nIt's called the Windows Backup and\nRestore.\n\n28\n00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.850\nAnd it has gone through a little\nbit of change, if you will,\n\n29\n00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.870\nin the fact that when Windows 8 came\nout and they introduced File History.\n\n30\n00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.630\nThey said you know what, we're making it\nvery, very easy to do a push button reset,\n\n31\n00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.530\na PC refresh, right,\na reset of the PC if you will.\n\n32\n00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.200\nRight, so you can use a few options.\n\n33\n00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.980\nWell, let me show you what I mean here.\n\n34\n00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.110\nIf I go down into my Windows 10 machine,\nright.\n\n35\n00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.890\nIf we just right click on our Windows\ntile here and we choose Settings, and\n\n36\n00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.030\nthen from our Settings, Windows\nsettings menu, if we go to Update and\n\n37\n00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.598\nSecurity, right,\nthis is where we want to be.\n\n38\n00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:14.940\nAnd then also,\nwe're gonna go to Backup, right?\n\n39\n00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.650\nIn previous episode,\nthis is what we would do.\n\n40\n00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.310\nWe would do Backup using File History.\n\n41\n00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.530\nWell, they also have the Recovery option\nhere, and if we click the Recovery option,\n\n42\n00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.495\nthis is what I wanna just\nshow you real quick, right?\n\n43\n00:02:27.495 --> 00:02:31.055\nSo you have the ability today\nto do a Reset this PC and\n\n44\n00:02:31.055 --> 00:02:33.995\nyou can see what it says, you're PC isn't\nrunning well, resetting might help it,\n\n45\n00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:38.215\nmight let you keep your personal files or\nremove them and reinstall Windows.\n\n46\n00:02:38.215 --> 00:02:40.075\nAnd they make this fairly easy.\n\n47\n00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:45.295\nSo one of the things they said is\nwell we'll introduce File History and\n\n48\n00:02:45.295 --> 00:02:47.395\nwe'll also give you these\npush button resets, right?\n\n49\n00:02:47.395 --> 00:02:50.010\nSo they kind of thought\nthat as time went on,\n\n50\n00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.090\nthere's really no reason to do\nthings like system images right?\n\n51\n00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.850\nA system image is\nliterally a bit by bit copy\n\n52\n00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.140\nof the entire contents of your hard drive,\noperating system, your files, everything.\n\n53\n00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.480\nThe partitions that are on\nthat hard drive as well.\n\n54\n00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.050\nNow, because of the fact that\nthey've got the reset PC option,\n\n55\n00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.990\nyou could just reinstall Windows and\n\n56\n00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.470\nyou could choose if you wanna keep\nyour files or you can remove them.\n\n57\n00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.110\nWell, some people do like the old\nWindows Backup and Restore, right.\n\n58\n00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.250\nWell, so, when Windows 8 came out, they\nsaid, no, we're just gonna go ahead and\n\n59\n00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.650\nwe're just gonna say we're\nnot using that anymore.\n\n60\n00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.610\nWell, enough people complained about that\nthat they brought it back in Windows 10.\n\n61\n00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.580\nEnough people were familiar with\nthe simplistic interface on how they could\n\n62\n00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.260\nback their files up, they could keep\na copy of the operating system.\n\n63\n00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.340\nAnd if a hard drive failed, or malware,\n\n64\n00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.960\nthere's quite a few different\nthings that might happen, right?\n\n65\n00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.120\nCould be a drive a drive failure,\ndevice failure, could be malware,\n\n66\n00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.190\nbut either way when they got a brand new\nhard drive reinstalled, that they could\n\n67\n00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.840\nrestore that operating system from bare\nmetal, which means a blank hard drive.\n\n68\n00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.090\nThat's what we're gonna look\nat today in this episode.\n\n69\n00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.840\nWe're gonna look at how you can\nuse the traditional backup and\n\n70\n00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.350\nRestore that's been\naround since Windows 7.\n\n71\n00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.760\n&gt;&gt; So, how do we get started?\n\n72\n00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.610\nWhere do we start?\n\n73\n00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.970\n&gt;&gt; Well, one of the first,\nand a great question.\n\n74\n00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.140\nSo one of the first places, Zach,\nwe're gonna go, is we are going to, and\n\n75\n00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.170\nwe'll do a scenic approach, right,\nbecause we want you to be familiar with\n\n76\n00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.697\nhow to navigate through the Windows 10\ninterface to get to this location, right.\n\n77\n00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.700\nThere's also some things,\nsome other changes in Windows 10.\n\n78\n00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.500\nOne thing is that they've kind of\neliminated, not really eliminated,\n\n79\n00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.770\nthey're trying to move away from our\ntraditional control panel, right.\n\n80\n00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.590\nThis is a utility that I like.\n\n81\n00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.330\nIt's an interface that I've been\nvery use to for a long time and\n\n82\n00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.890\nthey've got this new all settings menu,\nWindows settings menu.\n\n83\n00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.050\nAnd some people are a little confused,\nright?\n\n84\n00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.690\nBecause this is an example of\nus still using two technologies.\n\n85\n00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.480\nWe don't want to use the older technology\nbut we still need to lean on it and\n\n86\n00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.510\nwe'll just keep it under the hood.\n\n87\n00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.150\nSo let's make it a little bit less\nconfusing on how you can get to this\n\n88\n00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.680\nlocation.\n\n89\n00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.700\nSo here on our Windows 10 machine, couple\nof different ways that you can do this.\n\n90\n00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.490\nI've been usually, if you've been\nwatching some of the other episodes,\n\n91\n00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.860\nI've been using the little notification\narea on the right hand side.\n\n92\n00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.548\nBut we don't actually have to use that,\nit's just a commonality for me.\n\n93\n00:05:01.548 --> 00:05:04.930\nIf I right-click on the Windows\nlittle charm, if you will, or\n\n94\n00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.690\nthe little tile, you can, you'll notice\nthat there's the Settings option.\n\n95\n00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.530\nAnd notice there used to\nbe the Control Panel.\n\n96\n00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.930\nIt would be right here in\nthis location and it's gone.\n\n97\n00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.590\nDon't freak out.\n\n98\n00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.320\nLike I did, where's my Control Panel?\n\n99\n00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.450\nTrust me, it's there.\n\n100\n00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.070\nIt's just kinda hidden.\n\n101\n00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.090\nWhen we get into Window Settings,\nwe're gonna go back to that same location.\n\n102\n00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.115\nWe're gonna go to Update &amp; security,\nall right?\n\n103\n00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:27.628\nAnd then from there, notice that we have,\n\n104\n00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:30.340\nwell Backup,\nthird down from the top, right.\n\n105\n00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.980\nWe've got Windows Update,\nWindows Defender and Backup.\n\n106\n00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.720\nNow I know what you're probably saying,\nwell as you said, you're\n\n107\n00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.570\ngonna get us out of this new interface and\nyou're gonna show us this new legacy or\n\n108\n00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.460\nthe older Control Panel,\ntrust me it's there ladies and gentlemen.\n\n109\n00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.680\nI lie not to you.\n\n110\n00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.140\nAll right if I choose Go to Backup and\nRestore Windows 7 and\n\n111\n00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.190\nthey're doing this so\nyou know there's a difference here, right?\n\n112\n00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.814\nWhat they're trying to let you know is\nthat this isn't what was introduced in\n\n113\n00:05:54.814 --> 00:05:56.556\nWindows 8 and then 8.1, right?\n\n114\n00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:59.678\nThat's in a completely separate location\nlike I showed you in recovery, so\n\n115\n00:05:59.678 --> 00:06:00.860\nthere is no confusion here.\n\n116\n00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.730\nBut when you launch that little\nhyper link there, sure enough,\n\n117\n00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.440\nhere is your traditional Backup and\nRestore, right?\n\n118\n00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.490\nAnd let me go a little\nbit farther than that,\n\n119\n00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.220\nlet me kind of follow the cookie crumb\ntrail, or the bread crumb trail that they\n\n120\n00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.360\nhave here, and notice that yes I can\nget to my traditional Control Panel.\n\n121\n00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.080\nThey want you to lean on the new settings,\nbut the old settings are still there.\n\n122\n00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.690\n&gt;&gt; But it makes me feel so comfortable.\n\n123\n00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n124\n00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.490\nBring me back my Control Panel.\n\n125\n00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.755\nAll right, so we'll go ahead,\nwe'll go back to System and\n\n126\n00:06:29.755 --> 00:06:33.760\nSecurity and\nagain down here to Backup and Restore.\n\n127\n00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.710\nBy the way, those of you on\nthe following along out there and\n\n128\n00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.040\nit maybe have Windows 7, you don't need to\nworry about the, the Window settings menu.\n\n129\n00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.720\nYou can open up your control panel and\nyou can do exactly what we're doing here.\n\n130\n00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.180\nSo understand that we've\nbeen focusing on Windows 10.\n\n131\n00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.445\nBut this applies for Windows 7 as well,\nso don't think our Windows\n\n132\n00:06:50.445 --> 00:06:54.790\n7 viewers out there are out of\nthe woods here, it applies to you too.\n\n133\n00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.818\nAll right, so, what do we have to do?\n\n134\n00:06:56.818 --> 00:06:59.860\nThe first time we run this,\nwe have to set a backup right.\n\n135\n00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.750\nAnd it's interesting,\none of the that this,\n\n136\n00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.580\nlet me just expand a little bit more\non what Backup and Restore is, right.\n\n137\n00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.230\nIt was the GUI based graphical\nuser interface based\n\n138\n00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.472\nbackup system that we would\nuse starting in Windows 7.\n\n139\n00:07:12.472 --> 00:07:15.810\nAll right, it allows for\nscheduling of your backups, right Zack?\n\n140\n00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.640\nI joke around all the time and\nZach can probably testify to this.\n\n141\n00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.085\nI would lose my head if it wasn't\nattached to my neck, right?\n\n142\n00:07:22.085 --> 00:07:24.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can't remember yesterday, sometimes.\n\n143\n00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.430\nAnd Zach's like,\nI'm not gonna say anything about that.\n\n144\n00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.425\nBut thanks, Zach, I appreciate it.\n\n145\n00:07:28.425 --> 00:07:32.030\n[LAUGH] So imagine the ability to\nbe able to schedule the backup.\n\n146\n00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.560\nAnd man, you're running late one day, and\n\n147\n00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.800\nyou needed to run a backup,\nbut you ran out the door and\n\n148\n00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.300\nyou didn't manage to [LAUGH] And\nactually click the Backup Now button.\n\n149\n00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.490\nWell that's the great\nthing about scheduling.\n\n150\n00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.620\nIt also allows you to manage backups\nas well, not only backup scheduling,\n\n151\n00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.020\nyou can perform manual\nbackups if you want.\n\n152\n00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.421\nYou can perform selective backups,\nwhich I'll show you here, too.\n\n153\n00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:57.182\nWe've got a couple different ways that\nwe can do this when we run a backup as\n\n154\n00:07:57.182 --> 00:08:00.762\nwell as performing a restoration,\nright, restoring your backups,\n\n155\n00:08:00.762 --> 00:08:02.903\nwhich we'll show you a little bit later.\n\n156\n00:08:02.903 --> 00:08:05.150\nAll right so First thing that we gotta do.\n\n157\n00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.669\nAll right, let's go ahead and\n\n158\n00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:10.590\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\nchose this Set backup option.\n\n159\n00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:15.161\nAll right, and I will tell you a lot\nof times when you're working with this\n\n160\n00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:19.661\nWindows Backup and Restore,\nyou'll see that backup is starting a lot,\n\n161\n00:08:19.661 --> 00:08:22.127\neven if you're just managing things.\n\n162\n00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:23.580\nAnd you're not actually\nperforming a backup.\n\n163\n00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.730\nSo, just be patient with\nthat if it happens and\n\n164\n00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.620\nit really depends on\nthe speed of your machine.\n\n165\n00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.260\nIt's just Windows kind of\nquerying the operating system and\n\n166\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.910\ngetting it prepared for us, so\nthat the backup software can start to run.\n\n167\n00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:37.130\nNow the next thing that we\nhave to do is we have to,\n\n168\n00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.750\nagain, remember that we're\nstarting to set a back up.\n\n169\n00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.640\nRight, we're gonna schedule\na backup to happen.\n\n170\n00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.620\nSo a couple of things to keep in mind.\n\n171\n00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.427\nYes, you can do a DVD Drive but\n\n172\n00:08:47.427 --> 00:08:51.274\nremember that the DVDs are limited\nin their capacity, right?\n\n173\n00:08:51.274 --> 00:08:55.300\nWe're talking about a single\nsided DVD as 4.7 gigs.\n\n174\n00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.450\nEven if it's a dual sided DVD, right?\n\n175\n00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:02.150\nBoth sides it could be written\nto that's still 9.4 gigs.\n\n176\n00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.223\nThis could be a 60 gig backup,\nI mean you gotta be right there.\n\n177\n00:09:05.223 --> 00:09:08.830\nAnd you're gonna be switching DVDs just\nconstantly through the whole backup\n\n178\n00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.570\nprocess, not really something I recommend.\n\n179\n00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.600\nIf you have to, it's fine, it'll work.\n\n180\n00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.310\nBut I would suggest using\na fixed data drive, another\n\n181\n00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:23.490\nhard drive that we put in the machine, or\nusing an external USB device, all right?\n\n182\n00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.986\nNow with the external USB device,\nyou have to understand that you can\n\n183\n00:09:26.986 --> 00:09:30.613\nperform a manual backup, but\nyou can't set a scheduled backup there.\n\n184\n00:09:30.613 --> 00:09:34.462\nWindows doesn't want you set a scheduled\nbackup to a media that can potentially be\n\n185\n00:09:34.462 --> 00:09:37.160\nremoved from the machine just\nby kicking it, all right?\n\n186\n00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.690\nSo, yes, I can perform a manual backup but\nI can't schedule a backup to that.\n\n187\n00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:45.290\nThat's why I recommend that if you're\ngoing to set a backup schedule,\n\n188\n00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.753\nyou set it to an internally fixed drive,\nright?\n\n189\n00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:49.374\nIn this case it would\nan internal sata drive.\n\n190\n00:09:49.374 --> 00:09:53.750\nAnd that's why it's telling me\nit's Recommended, all right?\n\n191\n00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.140\nSo just understand there is a reason.\n\n192\n00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.160\nSometimes I don't [LAUGH]\nI live dangerously.\n\n193\n00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.770\nAnd if it says Recommended,\nI do the opposite thing.\n\n194\n00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.188\nThis one's here for a good reason, right?\n\n195\n00:10:03.188 --> 00:10:07.700\nSo there is a method to\nthe madness behind this one.\n\n196\n00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.150\nAll right, so we'll go ahead.\n\n197\n00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.070\nAnd by the way, if you ended up having\na media server out there on your network.\n\n198\n00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.100\nMaybe you're at a home network and you've\ngot a little media server where you save\n\n199\n00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.150\nyour pictures and stuff and\ngot plenty of storage.\n\n200\n00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.091\nWell you can set up\nan SMB share on there and\n\n201\n00:10:19.091 --> 00:10:21.768\nyou can actually point the back\nup over to that location.\n\n202\n00:10:21.768 --> 00:10:25.191\nAnd then, in the background when\nthe scheduled time happens,\n\n203\n00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:30.410\nit'll back up over to the network to a\ncompletely separate machine all together.\n\n204\n00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.590\nAnd that takes a little bit farther then\nyou get a little bit more fault tolerance\n\n205\n00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:34.400\nor redundancy.\n\n206\n00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.870\nSo again, remember,\nyou're trying to protect yourself\n\n207\n00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.440\nfrom the failure of your drive so\nthat you can restore it later.\n\n208\n00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.080\nAll right, so with all of that\nlong winded statement just wanted\n\n209\n00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:48.060\nto point that out here,\nwe will choose Next, all right.\n\n210\n00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.230\nNow we've got a couple of options, in fact\nit's funny I say a couple of options,\n\n211\n00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.610\nthere's quite a few options\nthrough the whole entire wizard.\n\n212\n00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.018\n[LAUGH] But one of the things that I like\nis that it's a very intuitive point and\n\n213\n00:10:57.018 --> 00:10:58.000\nclick wizard.\n\n214\n00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.720\nYou don't have to drop\ndown to the command line.\n\n215\n00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.830\nYou don't have to know how\nto reinvent the wheel,\n\n216\n00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.250\nyou don't have to know how to program.\n\n217\n00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.440\nYou just make a few choices.\n\n218\n00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:09.220\nNow, depending on the choice\nthat you choose, you could\n\n219\n00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:14.020\nhave sizable backups or you can actually\nkinda size the backups down, right?\n\n220\n00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.510\nYou could scale them down a little bit.\n\n221\n00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.500\nNow, if you let Windows choose,\nand again, it's recommended.\n\n222\n00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:22.330\nAnd if you aren't that tech savvy and\nwe're not talking down to you.\n\n223\n00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.410\nYou guys are sharp crowd out there, right?\n\n224\n00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:28.380\nBut maybe you don't wanna be\nbother with making the choice,\n\n225\n00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.850\nlet Windows choose that's fine.\n\n226\n00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.770\nBut I will tell you understand that it\ncould take a while because as you can see,\n\n227\n00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.900\nWindows will backup the data\nfiles saved in the library.\n\n228\n00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.689\nOn the desktop, all of your\ndefault Windows folders, right?\n\n229\n00:11:40.689 --> 00:11:44.750\nIn your default Windows folders are\ntypically what we call the user profile.\n\n230\n00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.720\nSo for instance, if I was to load up my or\n\n231\n00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.228\nlaunch up file explorer even\nthough it's a desktop right?\n\n232\n00:11:52.228 --> 00:11:55.005\nThose libraries,\nall of these are the user profile,\n\n233\n00:11:55.005 --> 00:11:59.275\nit's essentially gonna back all of that\ninformation up and then keep a copy of it.\n\n234\n00:11:59.275 --> 00:12:02.070\nNow it will do more than just that, okay?\n\n235\n00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:05.860\nHere's something to understand,\nit will also create a system image.\n\n236\n00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.980\nAll right, now, and\n\n237\n00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.370\nif you notice it says which can be used to\nrestore your computer if it stops working.\n\n238\n00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.010\nThese items will be backed\nup on a regular schedule.\n\n239\n00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.850\nHere's why I say be careful with this one,\n\n240\n00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.360\nbecause you're gonna start to\naccrue a lot of data on that drive.\n\n241\n00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.470\nNow in today's drive sizes,\nif you got a 1 TB drive,\n\n242\n00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.490\nyou might forget about it\nbecause it's 1 TB right?\n\n243\n00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:30.550\nBut I've seen where 1 TB gets filled\nup very, very quick on running that\n\n244\n00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.820\nbackup schedule, especially when we\nshow you how to change the schedule up.\n\n245\n00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.540\nYou could make it more frequently, less\nfrequently, it's up to you, so be careful.\n\n246\n00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:42.602\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna live dangerously.\n\n247\n00:12:42.602 --> 00:12:45.429\nThey're gonna tell me what they\nthink I should do and I'm gonna say,\n\n248\n00:12:45.429 --> 00:12:46.245\nyeah, whatever.\n\n249\n00:12:46.245 --> 00:12:47.460\n[LAUGH] No, just kidding.\n\n250\n00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.540\n[LAUGH] We're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna choose Next here.\n\n251\n00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:55.560\nAll right now, here's what is going to\nbackup when I choose a selective backup,\n\n252\n00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.700\nBack up data for newly created users.\n\n253\n00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.690\nYou say well Wes,\nI have created any users yet.\n\n254\n00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.910\nThat's right,\nremember scheduling a backup.\n\n255\n00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:07.320\nYou could create users since the last\ntime the backup's run so it says,\n\n256\n00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.390\nI don't even have to include it, right?\n\n257\n00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.050\nFrom then on out, once I've scheduled\nthe backup, you create a new user.\n\n258\n00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.040\nThey start saving files, guess what?\n\n259\n00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.330\nThey automatically get included in the\nback up which is a good thing, all right?\n\n260\n00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.890\nAdmin01's Libraries,\nis another user that's on the machine.\n\n261\n00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.657\nThis are the common location, library\nlocations that they talked about including\n\n262\n00:13:24.657 --> 00:13:28.333\nsome of the Additional Locations which\nwould include things like for instance.\n\n263\n00:13:28.333 --> 00:13:32.650\nJust like I said, everything that\nyou see in the user profile, right?\n\n264\n00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.140\nThat's not a bad thing.\n\n265\n00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:38.120\nNow I'm gonna go ahead, what I'm gonna\ndo is I'm gonna uncheck this and\n\n266\n00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:43.160\nbecause I'm just gonna worry\nabout my account here and\n\n267\n00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.620\nyou'll see that it does the same thing,\nright?\n\n268\n00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.950\nNow, when you do a selective sync,\n\n269\n00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:54.250\nit deselects your Local Disk (C:),\nbe careful with that.\n\n270\n00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:58.920\nIf you want that full image restoration,\nnot just selected files\n\n271\n00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.690\nwhich you can do as well,\nwe'll show you in the restore episode.\n\n272\n00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.605\nThen, you're gonna need to\ninclude this too, okay?\n\n273\n00:14:05.605 --> 00:14:07.730\nCuz this is the state of the machine.\n\n274\n00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:11.592\nIf I look in here, this is all the of\nthe systems data information including\n\n275\n00:14:11.592 --> 00:14:14.290\nthe system volume information\nthat let's me know or\n\n276\n00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:17.687\nlets the restore operation know,\nhey, this is, for instance.\n\n277\n00:14:17.687 --> 00:14:22.587\nAll the information about the drive,\nthe size of the partitions, the locations,\n\n278\n00:14:22.587 --> 00:14:24.620\nthe names of them, all the users.\n\n279\n00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:29.280\nSo you have to choose which\nones you're gonna back up.\n\n280\n00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.480\nNow notice here too,\nInclude Image of drives,\n\n281\n00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.120\nour System Reserved drive which\nis part of our boot files,\n\n282\n00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.220\nas well as things like the Windows\nRecovery Environment, all right?\n\n283\n00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.850\nNotice a system image, it tells you,\nis a copy of the drives required for\n\n284\n00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.100\nWindows to run.\n\n285\n00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:51.610\nAnd you can use it to restore your\ncomputer if it stops working, all right?\n\n286\n00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.300\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna choose Next.\n\n287\n00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.850\nAll right.\n\n288\n00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.780\nAnd it's gonna tell us that,\n\n289\n00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:02.560\nA system repair disc might be\nrequired to restore the system image.\n\n290\n00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.380\nNow, when we go into restoration,\nwe'll talk a little bit more about that.\n\n291\n00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.482\nAll right, now, notice that we can do here\nis we can is that we can save the settings\n\n292\n00:15:10.482 --> 00:15:11.800\nand we can run the backup.\n\n293\n00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.280\nSo, we'll go ahead and do that.\n\n294\n00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.700\nAnd again, it looks like,\nit didn't do anything.\n\n295\n00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:16.990\nWell, it takes a bit, right?\n\n296\n00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:21.360\nAnd you can see that the backup's in\nprocess or in progress excuse me.\n\n297\n00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:26.370\nNow, I've already got on another Windows\nmachine this process is completed,\n\n298\n00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:27.450\nso we could save a little time.\n\n299\n00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:30.120\nWe don't have to worry about\ndoing the magic of TV and\n\n300\n00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.590\ncoming back after the process is done.\n\n301\n00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:35.760\nNow, this might not take so\nlong cuz I did do a selective backup\n\n302\n00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:40.000\nrather than backing every single\n[LAUGH] file that's in this machine up,\n\n303\n00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.400\nI just said hey just go ahead and\ndo a few.\n\n304\n00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.410\nSo we actually might see\nthat it finishes before\n\n305\n00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.230\nwe get to look everything\nin the other machine.\n\n306\n00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.380\nSo let's go ahead and we'll jump on\nover to this other machine here and\n\n307\n00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.140\nyou can see the backup is done.\n\n308\n00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.750\nThis is what it should look like once\nthe backup finishes successfully.\n\n309\n00:15:55.750 --> 00:16:01.488\nNow, piece of advice a word of caution,\nokay?\n\n310\n00:16:01.488 --> 00:16:03.203\nWhen I run a backup job.\n\n311\n00:16:03.203 --> 00:16:04.828\nDon't stop right there.\n\n312\n00:16:04.828 --> 00:16:07.868\nYou don't want to wait until\nyou need your back-ups,\n\n313\n00:16:07.868 --> 00:16:11.584\nto determine if the back-up\nactually works successfully or not.\n\n314\n00:16:11.584 --> 00:16:13.577\nWe want to verify.\n\n315\n00:16:13.577 --> 00:16:19.680\nAnd one of the ways you can do that is you\ncan go to this, Manage space settings.\n\n316\n00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.770\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's manage some space.\n\n317\n00:16:23.835 --> 00:16:27.000\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here is kind of an overview.\n\n318\n00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.180\nNow again, this is for\nus, just an overview.\n\n319\n00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:35.570\nBut, what it allows us to do is see\nthe volume that the data is saved on.\n\n320\n00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.070\nI can see, well, data file image backup?\n\n321\n00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.300\nI can see how big it is.\n\n322\n00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.980\nNotice that this single\nsystem image jack is 17 GB.\n\n323\n00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.900\nOkay?\n\n324\n00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.595\nSo if this runs four times in a month,\nfour times.\n\n325\n00:16:49.595 --> 00:16:51.301\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you can get the picture.\n\n326\n00:16:51.301 --> 00:16:52.363\n&gt;&gt; What's gonna happen here?\n\n327\n00:16:52.363 --> 00:16:54.220\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna run out of space and\n[INAUDIBLE].\n\n328\n00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.150\n&gt;&gt; We can run out of space very quickly.\n\n329\n00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.820\nJobs like that.\n\n330\n00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.020\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n331\n00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:03.410\nSo, keep in mind that yes,\nscheduling backups, great to have.\n\n332\n00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.790\nYou schedule it, you walk away from it,\nand the backups happen.\n\n333\n00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.450\nTwo things, two considerations.\n\n334\n00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.585\nMake sure that the backup jobs like\nwe're gonna show you here in a second,\n\n335\n00:17:13.585 --> 00:17:16.335\nthat they have run successfully and\nthat there's data in them.\n\n336\n00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:20.330\nAnd the other thing is to\nmanage your space periodically.\n\n337\n00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:23.570\nThis isn't just a one size fits all.\n\n338\n00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:28.160\nNow, I can also see the free\nspace in this volume,\n\n339\n00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.140\nI just got a little 100 gig hard drive,\nnothing big here.\n\n340\n00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.330\nAnd look, data file backup.\n\n341\n00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.430\nIf I wanted to I could\ndelete data file backups,\n\n342\n00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:41.200\nbut I just wanna know the backups that\nare run, andI could see that it's 5 gigs.\n\n343\n00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.466\nNow you can also, and by the way,\nI kinda did that fast, so\n\n344\n00:17:44.466 --> 00:17:46.017\nlet me slow down a little bit.\n\n345\n00:17:46.017 --> 00:17:47.420\nI'm just so used to being here.\n\n346\n00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.600\nI just did that by View backups.\n\n347\n00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.900\nBut you can also browse that volume\nby clicking this little button.\n\n348\n00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:57.370\nAnd when you do, what you should see is\nthat you have a WindowsImageBackup here.\n\n349\n00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:58.480\nNow this is kind of interesting.\n\n350\n00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:03.160\nThis file here, some of you\nmight notice what this icon is,\n\n351\n00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.490\nif you've been around Windows for a while.\n\n352\n00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:06.280\nThis is actually a .MIG file.\n\n353\n00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.400\nI believe,\nlet's see if we can get the file.\n\n354\n00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.635\nIf this is a migration file,\nis what it's called.\n\n355\n00:18:11.635 --> 00:18:15.660\n.mig, I believe, I could be wrong,\n\n356\n00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:19.010\nlet's see if we can see what\nthe extension is on that file.\n\n357\n00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.650\nAnd it didn't do it,\nit's gonna protect it, but\n\n358\n00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:25.270\nanyways, what this is, these are some of\nthe settings that are on this machine.\n\n359\n00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.940\nThings like your applications settings,\nthe user settings, your profile settings\n\n360\n00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:34.880\nand then this is your complete backup\nhere and I'm not sure it might let me in.\n\n361\n00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.300\nIt did, and\nit's gonna give me some warnings here.\n\n362\n00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.380\nAnd again you don't wanna\nmess with things in here.\n\n363\n00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.570\nYou've got catalogs in here,\nlogs and stuff and it give you.\n\n364\n00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:48.057\nAnd here's the big thing, when I dove down\ninto this file, I can see the backup.\n\n365\n00:18:48.057 --> 00:18:50.784\nThat the backup has run, and\nthe information's there.\n\n366\n00:18:50.784 --> 00:18:54.079\nThat is a very good thing\nto be able to do and\n\n367\n00:18:54.079 --> 00:18:57.970\nmake sure you're backups have run, right?\n\n368\n00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.240\nNotice, we have system image.\n\n369\n00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.500\nYou can free up disk space if you need to,\n\n370\n00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.200\nchanging how Windows retains\nolder system images.\n\n371\n00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.790\nSo we can change the settings and\nnotice here, if I let Windows manage\n\n372\n00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:13.730\nthe space used for backup history,\nit shows me what the maximum is.\n\n373\n00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:17.470\nIt can also allow me to keep only\nthe latest system image, and\n\n374\n00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:22.030\nthis could be done for minimizing, as\nyou could see, space used by the backup.\n\n375\n00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.680\nSo a very good piece of software to have,\nvery easy to run.\n\n376\n00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.780\nLet's see if that other one up,\nthe other one's still running.\n\n377\n00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.882\nAnd you'll know that it's finished, other\nthan just the progress bar being done,\n\n378\n00:19:31.882 --> 00:19:35.929\nbecause these little hyperlinks or little\njump links we've been clicking all over\n\n379\n00:19:35.929 --> 00:19:39.013\nthe place, they'll turn blue and\nyou'll be able to use them.\n\n380\n00:19:39.013 --> 00:19:42.110\n&gt;&gt; Just a quick question,\nbecause my mind is tiny.\n\n381\n00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:45.910\nSo if we go to Backup, can we stop\nthe backup while it's backing up,\n\n382\n00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:47.580\nor we shouldn't do that?\n\n383\n00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:52.710\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't do that, just because\nwe're writing data to a hard drive.\n\n384\n00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.800\nAnd any time you stop any\nkind of write operation,\n\n385\n00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.570\nyou usually just wanna go ahead.\n\n386\n00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:01.020\nI mean, I guess if you have a reason to\nstop the backup, I don't really know.\n\n387\n00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.661\nBut I wouldn't-\n&gt;&gt; Not a good idea though.\n\n388\n00:20:02.661 --> 00:20:03.337\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n389\n00:20:03.337 --> 00:20:05.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And if you need to, we can show you,\n\n390\n00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:10.160\nyou can see what it's actually doing just\nby choosing this button on our screen,\n\n391\n00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.660\nView Details.\n\n392\n00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.590\nAnd you can see the progress here, and\n\n393\n00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:19.230\nyou can stop it like I said,\ngreat question, yes you can stop it.\n\n394\n00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.029\nI'm gonna continue it though but\nbe careful,\n\n395\n00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:25.847\nbecause yeah and like you could\nsee I'm actually stopping it.\n\n396\n00:20:25.847 --> 00:20:29.508\nAnd it will, you just have to rerun it and\nit says that it's cancelled,\n\n397\n00:20:29.508 --> 00:20:30.770\nit's not a problem.\n\n398\n00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.340\nYou turn around and you can do a manual\nbackup and you can restart it.\n\n399\n00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.960\nSo, it does give you the flexibility\nto do that, and again,\n\n400\n00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.040\nit's gonna do the same thing based on\nthe choices that we've already made cuz\n\n401\n00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.440\nwe're scheduling this, and\nit'll just start it again.\n\n402\n00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.450\nAnd that's okay.\n\n403\n00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.090\nFor whatever reason, if you do need to\nstop the back up during the back up\n\n404\n00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.120\nprocess, you have that ability.\n\n405\n00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.710\nKeep in mind,\nthat this should be done as part of,\n\n406\n00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:54.260\nnot only preventative system maintenance,\nbut normal system maintenance.\n\n407\n00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.620\nRemember that your back ups shouldn't,\nyou want to be proactive.\n\n408\n00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.000\nNot reactive, we're gonna be reactive, but\n\n409\n00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.440\nif we've been proactive meaning\nwe've done our backups beforehand.\n\n410\n00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.340\nThen we can get out of worrying\nabout things like data recovery\n\n411\n00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:09.120\nagents and stuff.\n\n412\n00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:14.280\nCuz data recovery, it's very, very\nexpensive and you can save yourself time,\n\n413\n00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:19.080\nmoney and a lot of headache by using the\nbackup software, prior to ever needing it.\n\n414\n00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.690\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful job, Wes, as usual.\n\n415\n00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.900\nGreat information that we can\nuse practically everyday.\n\n416\n00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.840\nBackup with Windows backup and restore.\n\n417\n00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.650\nAnd make sure you watch every single\nepisode, that Wes has put together for\n\n418\n00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:31.220\nyou in the PC maintenance Series.\n\n419\n00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.820\nAnd don't forget, our course library\nhas hundreds of other videos that\n\n420\n00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.170\nare all designed to help you go further.\n\n421\n00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.270\nTell everybody you know\nabout ITProTV as well.\n\n422\n00:21:39.270 -->

00:00:06.657\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:06.657 --> 00:00:10.208\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.208 --> 00:00:13.438\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.438 --> 00:00:17.350\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.890\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with PC maintenance.\n\n8\n00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.780\nAnd now we're gonna restore with Window's\nbackup and restore with the one and\n\n9\n00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.700\nonly Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.470\nWes, thanks again for helping us out.\n\n11\n00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.780\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, we ran that one\nepisode of how to use backup and\n\n12\n00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.465\nrestore to back up your files, and then we\nsaid, all right, we'll see you next time.\n\n13\n00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:35.528\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n14\n00:00:35.528 --> 00:00:38.440\nwe're backing here with\nthe to be continued.\n\n15\n00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.260\nAnd this isn't a part two or anything,\nbut we just want to kind of separate\n\n16\n00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.660\nthem because maybe some of you out there\nhave already run your backups, and\n\n17\n00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.445\nnow you just need to be able to restore.\n\n18\n00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:48.100\nSo we wanna ahead and\n\n19\n00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.060\nkind of split these up because there's\na couple of things that we need to do.\n\n20\n00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.090\nIf we're gonna do a restoration of the\nbackups that we made in a prior episode.\n\n21\n00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.600\nAnd there's a couple of different things\nwe can do when it comes to restoring your\n\n22\n00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.950\nfiles to get your computer back up online,\nright.\n\n23\n00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.550\nNow, if you've watched the episode before,\nwhere we used the windows backup and\n\n24\n00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.484\nrestore to again collect that data\nthat we want so that we don't used or\n\n25\n00:01:10.484 --> 00:01:11.563\nlose it excuse me.\n\n26\n00:01:11.563 --> 00:01:14.575\nThere were two different\ntypes of backup types right?\n\n27\n00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:17.895\nWe could do a selective backup,\nwe could let Windows choose and\n\n28\n00:01:17.895 --> 00:01:20.570\nit backs up all of your information right?\n\n29\n00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.250\nWell, depending on which\nselection you made\n\n30\n00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.830\nwill really dictate what type\nof restoration you're gonna do.\n\n31\n00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.770\nSo what we're gonna do,\n\n32\n00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.730\nwe're gonna start from the vantage point\nthat you've lost everything, right?\n\n33\n00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.500\nThat you've done, you let Window's,\nyou did the recommended.\n\n34\n00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.370\nYou didn't do what Wes did and\nrub against the grain there and\n\n35\n00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.890\ngo off the beaten path.\n\n36\n00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.732\nYou let Windows create you\na full system image all right?\n\n37\n00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:49.330\nNow what do we need to do\nto get back up and running?\n\n38\n00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.310\nLet's go ahead and let's show you.\n\n39\n00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.050\nWe've got our Windows 10 machine here.\n\n40\n00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.830\nAnd from the Windows 10 desktop what we're\ngonna do is we're going to go down to our\n\n41\n00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.822\nlittle Windows pane,\nlittle Windows icon there.\n\n42\n00:01:57.822 --> 00:02:00.130\nWe're gonna go ahead and right-click\non it and we're gonna choose settings.\n\n43\n00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.480\nAnd essentially what we're doing is going\nback to the same location that we see when\n\n44\n00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.550\nwe were using back up and\nrestore our files up.\n\n45\n00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.940\nWe're gonna go unto update in security.\n\n46\n00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.770\nAnd then third down from the top on\nthe left-hand side you're gonna see,\n\n47\n00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.560\nwell, we have the backup option here.\n\n48\n00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.080\nThat's what we want and this is where\nwe get the things like, for instance,\n\n49\n00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.050\nFile History if you're using File History.\n\n50\n00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.070\nIn this case we wanna go to\nthe traditional Backup and Restore.\n\n51\n00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.560\nGo ahead and click that.\n\n52\n00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.940\nNow, depending on what type of\nrestoration that we wanna do,\n\n53\n00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.360\nit's really gonna be important\nto use one of these two options.\n\n54\n00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.930\nNow, we're gonna go from the vantage point\nthat we've already created the system\n\n55\n00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.600\nimage, but what I need to do more so\nthan that.\n\n56\n00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.180\nIt's not create a system image.\n\n57\n00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.600\nWhat I need to do is I need to create\nwhat is known as a system repair disk.\n\n58\n00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.960\n&gt;&gt; So what is a system repair disk?\n\n59\n00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.860\nAre you talking about a hard disk that\nyou actually insert, an insertable?\n\n60\n00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.051\n&gt;&gt; Believe it or not,\nwe're taking a trip back in time.\n\n61\n00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:53.380\nAbsolutely what's happening.\n\n62\n00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.846\nA system repair disk essentially what\nit does is it gives you the ability\n\n63\n00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:04.780\nto boot into an environment that allows\nyou to troubleshoot things, right?\n\n64\n00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.920\nIt allows you to boot into what's known\nas the Windows Recovery Environment.\n\n65\n00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.730\n&gt;&gt; So\nwhat is the Windows Recovery Environment?\n\n66\n00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.219\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you the Windows\nRecovery Environment's been around for\n\n67\n00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.930\na bit and a lot of times\n&gt;&gt; A people, it's overlooked, right?\n\n68\n00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.050\nMany people don't ever, even in Windows 7,\nthey wouldn't create one of these repair\n\n69\n00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.400\ndisks, and the repair disk has\na bunch of features, right?\n\n70\n00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.810\nAnd we're gonna show you\nsome of those features.\n\n71\n00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.500\nBeing able to change\nyour startup settings,\n\n72\n00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.730\nbeing able to do automated startup repair.\n\n73\n00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.164\nBeing able to drop down to a command\nprompt to do things like fixing your boot\n\n74\n00:03:32.164 --> 00:03:34.246\npartitions, your boot sectors if you will.\n\n75\n00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:38.750\nA lot of great options in there,\nbut you gotta create it beforehand.\n\n76\n00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.862\nSo, that's what we wanna go ahead and\n\n77\n00:03:40.862 --> 00:03:45.486\nshow you as part of the recovery process\nis also creating that system repair dopes.\n\n78\n00:03:45.486 --> 00:03:48.736\nNow, I was saying, we're gonna have to\ntake a trip back in time here cuz I know\n\n79\n00:03:48.736 --> 00:03:52.238\nthese little guys here are becoming almost\nlike a thing of the past as we're getting\n\n80\n00:03:52.238 --> 00:03:53.860\nmore and more electronical storage.\n\n81\n00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.520\nThe optical disks just kinda seem\nlike they're going by the wayside,\n\n82\n00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.490\nbut the system repair disk\ndoes require one, all right?\n\n83\n00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.180\nSo let me go ahead inside\nof our operating system,\n\n84\n00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.200\nlet's look at our operating\nsystem real quick.\n\n85\n00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.660\nAnd let me kind of back out of this and\nshow you what I mean by that.\n\n86\n00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.448\nSo when I choose create a system repair\ndisk, notice what it tells me, right?\n\n87\n00:04:12.448 --> 00:04:15.340\nIt lets me know, right,\nhere's your answer there.\n\n88\n00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.940\nIn fact, I could probably just let Windows\ntell you what [LAUGH] the system repair\n\n89\n00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.650\ndisk, it does a real good job, right.\n\n90\n00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.350\nIt can boot your computer, right?\n\n91\n00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.340\nIt also contains system recovery tools\nright that helps you recover Windows from\n\n92\n00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.200\na serious error, right?\n\n93\n00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.590\nThat's the recovery environment, but\nnotice what it will also require.\n\n94\n00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.070\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It also requires the optical disk,\n\n95\n00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.640\nright?\n\n96\n00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.510\nThe optical drives.\n\n97\n00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.710\nSo we're gonna go ahead and let me\nback this out just a little bit here.\n\n98\n00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.350\nAnd I'm gonna take this optical disk, and\n\n99\n00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.810\nwhat I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna turn around.\n\n100\n00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.940\nAnd all we're gonna do is just plug it\nright in here to our optical tray, right?\n\n101\n00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.490\nNot so much of a big deal.\n\n102\n00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.589\nNow, those of you who are out there\nthat don't have optical drives,\n\n103\n00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:53.167\nyou're not gonna be able to\ncreate a System Repair disk.\n\n104\n00:04:53.167 --> 00:04:57.335\nIt's not really something that you can\nvirtualize, or throw it in an ISO and\n\n105\n00:04:57.335 --> 00:05:01.460\ncreate a bootable USB drive like we've\ndone in some of our other episodes.\n\n106\n00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.240\nSo just do keep that in mind.\n\n107\n00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.320\nNow if we take a look at our screen here,\nand this is one of those things they're\n\n108\n00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.790\nextract that if it's doesn't recognize\nit right away, just give it a second.\n\n109\n00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.800\nBecause when you first put in the optical\ndrive, you'll hear it spin and\n\n110\n00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.030\nyou might click this, if you like me,\n\n111\n00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.700\nyou get a little click Copy and\nyou click it and it doesn't do anything.\n\n112\n00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.210\nJust wait a second and\nlet the optical drive initialize,\n\n113\n00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.780\nrecognize that there's a disc in there.\n\n114\n00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.280\nSame thing with Windows and\nthen choose Create disc.\n\n115\n00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.236\nAnd what you're gonna see is that\nit's preparing the files and\n\n116\n00:05:29.236 --> 00:05:30.980\nit starts to create the disc as well.\n\n117\n00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.560\nAnd this is one of those things that\nit could take a little bit as it\n\n118\n00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.000\npulls the recovery environment\nout of the system volume and\n\n119\n00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.790\nit places it and starts it writing\nit to these optical drive.\n\n120\n00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.790\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking,\nwhen you mentioned earlier,\n\n121\n00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.020\nif you don't have an optical drive in\nyour PC, couldn't you get an external\n\n122\n00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.780\noptical drive and\njust plug in Vis-à-vis the U.S.B. or some.\n\n123\n00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.250\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely and you or\nyou can and that's a great question and\n\n124\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.980\nit's also a great way\nit's a it's a great way.\n\n125\n00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.640\nThat if you don't have an optical\ndrive built into the device that\n\n126\n00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.850\nyes you can get around that fact\nthat I need an optical drive in and\n\n127\n00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.700\nto the create one of\nthis system repair does.\n\n128\n00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.654\nIf you have access to that, I kind of\nrecommend in fact, we were talking before\n\n129\n00:06:10.654 --> 00:06:14.877\nwe started up this show that we've\ngot one of our guys around here.\n\n130\n00:06:14.877 --> 00:06:18.077\nHe actually needed to do\nsomething like this and\n\n131\n00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:22.557\nhe pull whole entire optical disk\nout of another work station, and\n\n132\n00:06:22.557 --> 00:06:26.730\nhe plugged an external SATA\ndrive connections, right?\n\n133\n00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.590\nIt has the 15 connector for\nthe power and the data connector.\n\n134\n00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.200\nAnd then plug that in via USB and\nit powered the optical drive and\n\n135\n00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.070\nhe was able to use it.\n\n136\n00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.700\nSo I'm kinda glad you asked that.\n\n137\n00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.830\nNow understand you can get creative and\ngo to that extreme, but\n\n138\n00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.560\nthey also sell the external optical drives\nthat allow you to do that very thing.\n\n139\n00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.350\nSo you can see that it's almost done here.\n\n140\n00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.870\nWe're gonna go ahead towards the end\nof this, it could take a little bit.\n\n141\n00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.650\nWe're gonna use the magic of TV and\nwe'll come back when this is finished, and\n\n142\n00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:53.860\nwe'll move on in this episode.\n\n143\n00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.010\nAnd Zach, all in all, even using our\nTV magic here, it really wasn't too bad\n\n144\n00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.030\nbecause there's been some of\nthe things that Zach and I have done.\n\n145\n00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.320\nAnd Zach, you can testify to this where\nit takes quite awhile and we're waiting.\n\n146\n00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.820\nThat really wasn't too bad and you can\nsee that the process is finished here.\n\n147\n00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.510\nAnd what'd I'd like to do is just kinda\ntake a second to recap why we created this\n\n148\n00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.422\nsystem image.\n\n149\n00:07:14.422 --> 00:07:18.000\nYou asked earlier,\nwhat is inside of the system image?\n\n150\n00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.215\nKeep in mind that it's\nthe recovery environment.\n\n151\n00:07:21.215 --> 00:07:24.795\nYou have things like, for instance, your\nrecovery tools that we're gonna show you.\n\n152\n00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:27.618\nAnd while I'm doing that,\nin the background I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n153\n00:07:27.618 --> 00:07:28.765\njust reboot this machine.\n\n154\n00:07:28.765 --> 00:07:32.255\nAnd I'll boot into the recovery\nenvironment, we'll actually see it.\n\n155\n00:07:32.255 --> 00:07:35.165\nNow, I do want you to pay attention\nthough because when you create one\n\n156\n00:07:35.165 --> 00:07:40.630\nof the system repair disks,\nit is architecture dependent.\n\n157\n00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.530\nAnd what I mean by that,\nis that if you have a 32 bit system,\n\n158\n00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.180\nyou need a 32 bit repair disk.\n\n159\n00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:49.519\nIf you have a 64 bit system,\nyou're gonna need a 64 bit repair disk.\n\n160\n00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:53.214\nSo just make sure that you know that so\nif have any 32 bit machines and\n\n161\n00:07:53.214 --> 00:07:57.481\nyou go through this process and you create\na system repair disk Unfortunately,\n\n162\n00:07:57.481 --> 00:08:00.493\ndon't expect it to work on\na 64 bit operating system.\n\n163\n00:08:00.493 --> 00:08:04.077\nSo make sure 32 bit with 32 bit,\n64 bit with 64 bit, just so\n\n164\n00:08:04.077 --> 00:08:05.630\nyou don't have any issues.\n\n165\n00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.850\nAnd it looks like my screen here,\nwe've rebooted and\n\n166\n00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.410\nwe're in to our recovery environment.\n\n167\n00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:15.090\nNow, if you don't have the Windows 10,\nbecause it's a complete\n\n168\n00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:19.230\nfailure of the drive you might see\nthat that it doesn't even see that.\n\n169\n00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:23.620\nThe recovery environment is smart enough\nto know if it sees a Windows operating\n\n170\n00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.380\nsystem in an installation.\n\n171\n00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.010\nEven if it's problematic,\nit's having driver issues.\n\n172\n00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.480\nIt still knows that\nthe operating system is there.\n\n173\n00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.370\nSo it'll ask you do you wanna go\ninto the recovery enviroment or\n\n174\n00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.580\ndo you wanna just continue\nto boot to Windows 10 right?\n\n175\n00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.090\nSo what we're doing is,\n\n176\n00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.690\nfrom the perspective that we're doing\na bare metal restore here, all right?\n\n177\n00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.580\nSo you, if that's the case,\n\n178\n00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.670\nchances are you'll only have these two\noptions, you won't have his third option.\n\n179\n00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.940\nSo I don't want you to think that if\nyou're looking at the recovery enviroment\n\n180\n00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.830\nfollowing along right now.\n\n181\n00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.000\nThat you've necessarily\ndone something wrong.\n\n182\n00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.850\nYou haven't.\n\n183\n00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:01.320\nIf drivers cause issues, if files\nget corrupted, if the malware won't\n\n184\n00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.490\nallow the computer to boot,\nWindows Recovery doesn't understand that.\n\n185\n00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:06.860\nIt does understand hey,\n\n186\n00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.930\nI looked at this hard drive and\nI can see a Windows System Volume.\n\n187\n00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.060\nI can see that information, so\nto me, there's an active Windows\n\n188\n00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.640\noperating system on that regardless\nof the state that it's in.\n\n189\n00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.040\nSo I want you to ignore that if you are,\n\n190\n00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.390\nbecause you can use the system repair disk\nwhen you start to have startup issues.\n\n191\n00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:27.570\nYou don't have to wait to do the full\nimage restoration on this one so\n\n192\n00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.310\njust be aware of that.\n\n193\n00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:29.840\nSo here we go.\n\n194\n00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.760\nWe're gonna go back in.\n\n195\n00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.520\nAnd we'll continue along in our\nWindows recovery environment.\n\n196\n00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.120\nWe're gonna choose troubleshoot.\n\n197\n00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.280\nAnd here are those tools.\n\n198\n00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.360\nNow, Zach, you said,\nwhat's a recovery environment?\n\n199\n00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.130\nThis is the recovery environment.\n\n200\n00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:41.820\nThey call it an advanced options.\n\n201\n00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.960\nBut this is for\n\n202\n00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:48.180\na long time been known as what is\nWindows RE, if I can say that right.\n\n203\n00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:48.680\nAll right.\n\n204\n00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.780\nIt allows you to do a traditional\nsystem restore if you need to.\n\n205\n00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.420\nVery nice to have access to it\nif you install a driver and\n\n206\n00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.600\nit locks you out of your computer.\n\n207\n00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.920\nBut what I want is not the command prompt.\n\n208\n00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.910\nNot to go back to a previous version or\neven the automated start up repair.\n\n209\n00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.200\nNotice what I want.\n\n210\n00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.420\nSystem image recovery.\n\n211\n00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:11.110\nNow, we've already created a system image\nright, in part of our backup episode.\n\n212\n00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.000\nSo this was already done beforehand.\n\n213\n00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.260\nThis will not work if you don't\nhave the image present prior\n\n214\n00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.370\nto performing this operation.\n\n215\n00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:19.930\nSo we'll go ahead and run it, and\n\n216\n00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.800\nnotice it's saying hey,\nchoose the target operating system.\n\n217\n00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.570\nAnd we'll choose Windows.\n\n218\n00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.930\nAnd it's smart enough to know that\nif you've got a drive connected or\n\n219\n00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.980\nyou have a fixed drive\ninside of the system,\n\n220\n00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.700\nit can read that information when we\nverify that the backup had was created.\n\n221\n00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.110\nIt's one of the reasons I told you\nverify that the backup was created,\n\n222\n00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.690\ndon't just assume it was.\n\n223\n00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.930\nBecause your image restoration is really\n\n224\n00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.690\nrelying on that information, so\nthat I don't even have to look.\n\n225\n00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.300\nIt knows and\nit knows what the best image is,\n\n226\n00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.270\nincluding what the most current image is.\n\n227\n00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:58.330\nSo if you're one of these people that\nare doing multiple images and you just\n\n228\n00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:02.970\nkeep stair stacking them on top of each\nother until the drive gets full, right.\n\n229\n00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.660\nYou wanna know which one\nis the latest one, right?\n\n230\n00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.230\nNow what if the latest one,\nfor whatever reason,\n\n231\n00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.090\nbaked in some kinda virus or\nsome kinda problem?\n\n232\n00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.480\nWell then, in that case, what you're\ngonna do is you could go in here and\n\n233\n00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.200\nyou could go a little bit more advanced.\n\n234\n00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.810\nRemember I told you any time it says\nRecommended, I do the opposite.\n\n235\n00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:23.000\n[LAUGH] You could do select an image and\nyou could choose Next, and\n\n236\n00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.960\nif you got multiple images in here,\nyou can select the one that you want.\n\n237\n00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.620\nI don't have multiple images.\n\n238\n00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.110\nI only have the one that we've created.\n\n239\n00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:37.080\nThe other thing too is that maybe\na driver has become corrupt and\n\n240\n00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.930\nI wanna install a non-corrupted driver.\n\n241\n00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.180\nI wanna try to fix the problem.\n\n242\n00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.640\nWell, you could choose Advanced, and\n\n243\n00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.780\nwhen you choose advanced,\nit's a couple cool things.\n\n244\n00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.720\nWell, maybe my image was on that media\nserver that we told you you could back up\n\n245\n00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.820\nover the network and i could save\nmy backups to the media server.\n\n246\n00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.140\nWell you might have it to where,\n\n247\n00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.940\nguess what,\nthe backup image is on the media server.\n\n248\n00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.180\nIt's not on a local drive.\n\n249\n00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.720\nIt's not on your local machine, so\nyou can connect over the network and\n\n250\n00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.570\nyou can pull the image and\n\n251\n00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.860\napply it to the hard drive, over\nthe network which is phenomenal, right?\n\n252\n00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.250\nThe other thing is we could\ninstall that driver if we need to.\n\n253\n00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:15.620\nSo, a lot of good functionalities there, a\nlot of, a lot of flexibility if you will.\n\n254\n00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.900\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust select our local disk D or\n\n255\n00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.720\nthe image that it already selected for me.\n\n256\n00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.150\nAnd, it's gonna give you\nthe information so select the date and\n\n257\n00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.960\ntime of the image you restore if\nthere's more than one image present.\n\n258\n00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.920\nThank goodness we don't\nhave to worry about that.\n\n259\n00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.670\nWe've only got one, so\nour options are kinda limited.\n\n260\n00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.860\nNow we could also do some formatting.\n\n261\n00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:42.450\nWe could drop down to disk management, we\ncould partition and prepare the drive for\n\n262\n00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:43.230\nthe image itself.\n\n263\n00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.230\nRemember the image Is already\na complete volume all right.\n\n264\n00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.380\nI don't really need to worry about it.\n\n265\n00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.000\nYou could if you want again\nbecause the flexibility is there,\n\n266\n00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.380\nbut I'm not really worried about that.\n\n267\n00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.060\nAnd again one last time to\ninstall drivers if we want.\n\n268\n00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.710\nWe'll go ahead and choose next.\n\n269\n00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:00.350\nHere's your review.\n\n270\n00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.770\nYour computer will be restored\nfrom the following system image.\n\n271\n00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:07.330\nAnd again depending on big the image\nis this might take a bit all right.\n\n272\n00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.190\nNow It's letting you know,\nall the data on the drives to\n\n273\n00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.490\nbe restored will be replaced with\nthe data in the system image.\n\n274\n00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:18.605\nThis is the last, are you sure, are you\nreally sure, are you super, super sure?\n\n275\n00:13:18.605 --> 00:13:19.530\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n276\n00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:23.320\nSo we're going to say we are super,\nsuper sure and we're going to hope that\n\n277\n00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.550\nthe JFK documents are not on that\ndrive that we're about to interrupt.\n\n278\n00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.417\n&gt;&gt; They might be.\n\n279\n00:13:28.417 --> 00:13:31.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Uh-oh, we could've found\nout where Hoffa actually was there,\n\n280\n00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.982\nbut no more,\nbecause we're now overwriting it.\n\n281\n00:13:33.982 --> 00:13:35.830\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So you can see here-\n\n282\n00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:36.580\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, Jimmy.\n\n283\n00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.350\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n284\n00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:41.290\nWindows is restoring your\ncomputer from the system image.\n\n285\n00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.850\nNotice it says it might take\na few minutes, up to a few hours.\n\n286\n00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:49.220\nAgain, 60 gig image,\nprobably doesn't take that long.\n\n287\n00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.150\nIt's a 20 gig image,\nprobably doesn't take that long.\n\n288\n00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:59.710\nA three terabyte image, go ahead, step\naway from your machine, go watch a movie.\n\n289\n00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:03.545\nCome back, then go watch another\nmovie maybe and come back.\n\n290\n00:14:03.545 --> 00:14:07.470\n[LAUGH] Now you can see that it really\nisn't taking too long here, but\n\n291\n00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:12.320\nagain If you're moving into a PC,\nif you're a home market,\n\n292\n00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:17.300\nyou're probably don't care about\nthe progress bars, but if you're in IT you\n\n293\n00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.550\nprobably see these progress bars a lot\nmore than you really want to in life.\n\n294\n00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.830\nSo what we're gonna do is we'll go ahead\n,we're gonna use another TV time out and\n\n295\n00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.910\nwhen we come back, we'll see if\nthis image as been restored and\n\n296\n00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.900\nwe'll see if we can get into\nour Windows Operating System.\n\n297\n00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.830\nSo Zach, this one wasn't really that bad,\n\n298\n00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.280\nbecause it's a smaller system image,\nright?\n\n299\n00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.170\nSo it didn't take a long time for us, but\nkeep in mind, this literally could take,\n\n300\n00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.920\nI've seen it sometimes take 12 hours,\nyou know,\n\n301\n00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.490\nwhen we're talking about\nthree terabyte drives.\n\n302\n00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:48.900\nSo one of the things you kind of miss,\nbecause it goes by it,\n\n303\n00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.460\nit doesn't really let me stop it,\nis if you want to reboot the computer,\n\n304\n00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.350\nyou can stop the reboot or\nyou can go ahead and reboot.\n\n305\n00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.330\nI just went ahead and\nsaid, no, don't reboot.\n\n306\n00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.220\nAnd you can see it just keeps this right\nhere in the Windows Recovery Environment.\n\n307\n00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.000\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna choose this option, exit and\n\n308\n00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.010\ncontinue to Windows 10.\n\n309\n00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:08.400\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and hope it says,\nrestart your PC to try again.\n\n310\n00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.440\nHopefully we can restart it now.\n\n311\n00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.620\nSometimes it might be the boot loader\nthat it's trying to identify here,\n\n312\n00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.550\nso we'll go ahead and just give it\na second and see if it reboots.\n\n313\n00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.400\nAnd we don't want to press the any\nkey cuz we don't want to go back into\n\n314\n00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.880\nour system repair disk.\n\n315\n00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.520\nSo we'll just give it a second here and\nit will detect devices.\n\n316\n00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.340\nSometimes I have seen this too\nwhen you do a system image.\n\n317\n00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.900\nAnd Windows is restarting for\nthe first time.\n\n318\n00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.270\nIt collects a little bit of information.\n\n319\n00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.990\nYou can see it's trying to start up here.\n\n320\n00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:38.860\nOne of the things that is a telltale\nsign that the image process didn't\n\n321\n00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:43.160\nsucceed other than the fact\nthat it just doesn't reboot, or\n\n322\n00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.830\nis the fact that it gets in kinda\nwhat we call a boot loop okay.\n\n323\n00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.330\nIf that happens,\nyou could have a corrupted image.\n\n324\n00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:52.217\nYou noticed that it says, there was\na problem, I don't know what to do.\n\n325\n00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:57.384\nSo it reboots itself, it kinda resets the\nWindows boot manager and the winload.exe\n\n326\n00:15:57.384 --> 00:16:02.347\nfile that's the bootstrap or is the file\nthat bootstraps the operating system.\n\n327\n00:16:02.347 --> 00:16:05.261\nEverything's good to go, and\nit kinda helps itself on the fly.\n\n328\n00:16:05.261 --> 00:16:10.551\nAnd hopefully, what we're gonna see here\nis that we can log into our machine.\n\n329\n00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.400\nAnd we are up and running.\n\n330\n00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.090\nSo a really good way, right?\n\n331\n00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.440\nAnd just in case you guys didn't know,\n\n332\n00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.600\nkeep in mind that hard\ndrive was completely blank.\n\n333\n00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.994\nThere wasn't even an operating\nsystem on it, right?\n\n334\n00:16:23.994 --> 00:16:29.272\nNow we've applied the, again, that image\nback down to the bare metal drive.\n\n335\n00:16:29.272 --> 00:16:31.923\nAnd essentially, Zach,\nwe've got a operating system and\n\n336\n00:16:31.923 --> 00:16:34.476\nwhat's great is I actually\ndeleted some of these files.\n\n337\n00:16:34.476 --> 00:16:36.441\nYou might not have seen them\non the desktop earlier.\n\n338\n00:16:36.441 --> 00:16:39.224\nAnd look here,\nthey're part of the Windows system image.\n\n339\n00:16:39.224 --> 00:16:41.515\nSo you can also bring\nsome of those files back.\n\n340\n00:16:41.515 --> 00:16:45.683\nNow that was an entire system image\nrestoration that we did, right?\n\n341\n00:16:45.683 --> 00:16:47.977\nYou can also do a selective restore too.\n\n342\n00:16:47.977 --> 00:16:49.180\nSo let me just take a second.\n\n343\n00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.298\nI know we're kinda running\na little bit short on time, but\n\n344\n00:16:52.298 --> 00:16:54.680\nthis one really shouldn't take too long.\n\n345\n00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.000\nIf we notice that we're on the left-hand\nside of the screen, and I choose settings,\n\n346\n00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.580\nwe're gonna go back to the same location,\nguys and gals out there.\n\n347\n00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.170\nSo no different,\nwe're gonna go back to Update and\n\n348\n00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.550\nrecovery, and we're gonna go to Backup.\n\n349\n00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.600\nRemember, the same place\nthat we looked at earlier.\n\n350\n00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.430\nAnd so when we get there, let me see.\n\n351\n00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.786\nThere we go, and\napparently it didn't like that.\n\n352\n00:17:14.786 --> 00:17:15.889\nSo we're not going there.\n\n353\n00:17:15.889 --> 00:17:18.815\nWe're gonna go the scenic\nroute [LAUGH] apparently.\n\n354\n00:17:18.815 --> 00:17:23.470\nWe'll try that one more time,\nSettings and Update and security.\n\n355\n00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.545\nAnd hopefully, that'll take us,\nboy, that is interesting.\n\n356\n00:17:27.545 --> 00:17:30.670\nLet's try it one more way here.\n\n357\n00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.370\nIt doesn't look like it's\ngiving me access to that.\n\n358\n00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:34.867\nI don't know what, there we go.\n\n359\n00:17:34.867 --> 00:17:37.096\nSo apparently I wasn't holding\nmy mouth right when I-\n\n360\n00:17:37.096 --> 00:17:38.013\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] You had to go around\n\n361\n00:17:38.013 --> 00:17:38.641\nthe mulberry bush.\n\n362\n00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:42.356\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\nabsolutely, that's exactly it.\n\n363\n00:17:42.356 --> 00:17:44.680\nSo we're gonna try to click Backup here.\n\n364\n00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.619\nAnd I hope the screen stays open, right?\n\n365\n00:17:47.619 --> 00:17:51.806\n[LAUGH] So choose Backup,\nlet it kinda query the system here.\n\n366\n00:17:51.806 --> 00:17:53.640\nWe'll go to Backup and restore.\n\n367\n00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:58.030\nAnd what the great thing about the system\nimages again is it's a bit by bit copy, so\n\n368\n00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.790\nit even knows, hey.\n\n369\n00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.830\nYou had a backup beforehand,\nwe can go ahead and\n\n370\n00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.450\nif you need to restore,\nyou can always do that.\n\n371\n00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:10.480\nNotice it says we could select another\nbackup to restore from if we wanted to.\n\n372\n00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.470\nWe could always do just the simple\nrestore and it gives us the information.\n\n373\n00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:18.682\nWe could choose Next,\nif we want, here, right?\n\n374\n00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:21.684\nAnd it says, hey, you wanna search for\nthose files, you wanna browse for\n\n375\n00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:22.760\nthe files or the folders?\n\n376\n00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.691\nHere's my backup of C.\n\n377\n00:18:24.691 --> 00:18:29.436\nI could open that and I could say,\nI remember where that folder was.\n\n378\n00:18:29.436 --> 00:18:31.808\nIt was in the Users folder.\n\n379\n00:18:31.808 --> 00:18:33.954\nRemember I was Admin01 and\n\n380\n00:18:33.954 --> 00:18:39.240\nI had some documents there that I\nwanted to go ahead and I wanted to add.\n\n381\n00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.600\nI'll just add my desktop.ii file,\nmy configuration file,\n\n382\n00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.808\njust to kinda give you an example there.\n\n383\n00:18:44.808 --> 00:18:48.012\nYou can add that file and\nthen once it's done, you choose Next.\n\n384\n00:18:48.012 --> 00:18:50.764\nAnd you have the ability to put\nit in the original location.\n\n385\n00:18:50.764 --> 00:18:54.250\nOr you can do an alternate location, which\nis kind of akin to what we did, Zach,\n\n386\n00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.163\nif you remember in our file history\nwhere you could put it right back\n\n387\n00:18:57.163 --> 00:18:58.660\ninto the user profile.\n\n388\n00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.420\nOr you could turn around and\nyou could say, no,\n\n389\n00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.460\nI didn't really wanna save that\nfile in the Downloads folder.\n\n390\n00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.230\nI mean,\nthat's not where I save it in Documents.\n\n391\n00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.660\nAnd then we just turned around and\nwe moved it right over to Documents.\n\n392\n00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.025\nSo we'll just go ahead, and\nwe'll say the original location.\n\n393\n00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:13.735\nIt's already finding my desktop.ini file.\n\n394\n00:19:13.735 --> 00:19:14.935\nI just used this as an example.\n\n395\n00:19:14.935 --> 00:19:16.611\nThe desktop.ini file,\n\n396\n00:19:16.611 --> 00:19:21.973\nit's one of these ini files that contains\nthe configurations of your desktop.\n\n397\n00:19:21.973 --> 00:19:25.224\nIt's stored in your user profile,\nand it might find that.\n\n398\n00:19:25.224 --> 00:19:27.356\nAnd it'll say,\ndo you wanna copy and replace?\n\n399\n00:19:27.356 --> 00:19:28.683\nDo you don't wanna copy?\n\n400\n00:19:28.683 --> 00:19:31.010\nI'm just gonna say go ahead and\ncopy and replace.\n\n401\n00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.140\nAnd choose finish.\n\n402\n00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.520\nAnd like that,\nwe've also done a selective restore, too.\n\n403\n00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:40.980\nWe can restore everything or\nwe can specify individual files.\n\n404\n00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.222\nOne last thing,\njust like we said in the backup,\n\n405\n00:19:43.222 --> 00:19:46.516\nif you wanna do a system image\nrestoration, create your system image.\n\n406\n00:19:46.516 --> 00:19:48.258\nWe've already showed you\nthat in another episode.\n\n407\n00:19:48.258 --> 00:19:52.760\nAnd now, here we've also showed you\nhow to create the system repair disk.\n\n408\n00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.670\nCreate it anyways,\n\n409\n00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:57.270\nbecause even if you're not doing a full\nimage system recovery, it can always help\n\n410\n00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.990\nyou to troubleshoot those problems in\nWindow's should they come your way.\n\n411\n00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:01.840\n&gt;&gt; That's right, Wes.\n\n412\n00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.280\nYou can never be too careful.\n\n413\n00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.180\nThis has been restoring\nWindow's backup and restore.\n\n414\n00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.530\nAnd the PC maintenance theories,\nmake sure you watch all those episodes and\n\n415\n00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:10.710\ncheck out the course library.\n\n416\n00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.972\nHundreds of videos all designed\nto help you go further.\n\n417\n00:20:13.972 --> 00:20:15.849\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n418\n00:20:15.849 --> 00:20:17.080\nThey'll be really glad you did.\n\n419\n00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:17.730\nThanks for watching.\n\n420\n00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:18.490\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n421\n00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:19.310\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n422\n00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.392\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n423\n00:20:21.392 --> 00:20:27.255\n[MUSIC]\n\n424\n00:20:27.255 --> 00:20:31.789\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",
