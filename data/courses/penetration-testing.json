testing.\n\n3\n00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.650\nAnd here to tell us all about it and\nwhat we can expect is Mr Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.130\n&gt;&gt; Mike, I am so excited about\nthis new series we got coming up.\n\n5\n00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.040\nWorked long and hard to bring you guys\na great penetration testing series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.760\nGot a lot of really cool techniques and\ntools and\n\n7\n00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.360\nthings that we're gonna walk through and\n\n8\n00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.220\nshow you guys, that you can properly\npenetration and test your own systems.\n\n9\n00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.730\nThat's our great caveat\nwe always like to say.\n\n10\n00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.040\nDon't do these things on\nother people's computers.\n\n11\n00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.460\nLet me give you a quick rundown on\nsome of the techniques and tools,\n\n12\n00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.580\nand items that you might find\nin our series coming up.\n\n13\n00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.790\nWe're gonna learn basics of Linux.\n\n14\n00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.510\nWe're gonna take a look at Kali Linux\nas a pen-testing platform.\n\n15\n00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.220\nWe're gonna use it extensively\nthroughout the series.\n\n16\n00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.820\nSo, if you're unfamiliar with Linux you\nget a little bit of a primer there.\n\n17\n00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.560\nWe do have a bit of assumed knowledge\nwhen it comes to this level,\n\n18\n00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.180\nbecause it is a very high level course.\n\n19\n00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.800\nYou do have to have some Linux knowledge.\n\n20\n00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.580\nYou do need to have a pretty good\nextensive Windows knowledge.\n\n21\n00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.120\nYou will probably need some\nprogramming knowledge as well.\n\n22\n00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.030\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n23\n00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.660\nThis series is definitely\ngoing to test you.\n\n24\n00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.770\nIt's gonna twist you.\n\n25\n00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.500\nIt's gonna push you to the edge because\nthere's a lot of advanced techniques and\n\n26\n00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.090\nmethodologies that you're\ngonna find throughout.\n\n27\n00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.930\nA couple other things that we're gonna\ntake a look at is how to create shells.\n\n28\n00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.300\nBind shells, reverse shells,\nvery cool stuff.\n\n29\n00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.140\nScanning and\nenumeration tools and techniques.\n\n30\n00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.150\nTools are all out there.\n\n31\n00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.160\nWe definitely all need to know how\nto do things like end map scans.\n\n32\n00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.563\nWork with, I don't know for\nweb scanning, SQL scanning,\n\n33\n00:01:38.563 --> 00:01:42.670\ntons of different types of\nscanning options available for us.\n\n34\n00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.420\nWe need to find the flaws right.\n\n35\n00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.460\nThen we need to look on writing\ncustom buffer overflows.\n\n36\n00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.670\nYes, when I said this gets\na little bit above board\n\n37\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.282\nthis is where the definitely\nthe metal meets the meat.\n\n38\n00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:58.690\nWe're gonna walk you through a finding,\ncreating, and\n\n39\n00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.130\nexploiting a program that is\nvulnerable to a buffer overflow.\n\n40\n00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.210\nSo taking you from soup that's on that.\n\n41\n00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.030\nWe'll also take a look\nat cross side scripting.\n\n42\n00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.485\nA very common technique nowadays.\n\n43\n00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:13.450\nSo you how to implement that so that\nyou might be able to test your systems.\n\n44\n00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.580\nContinuing on the line of maybe,\nweb, we have client side attacks,\n\n45\n00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.790\nsession hijacking, very dangerous,\nremote and local file inclusions.\n\n46\n00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.290\nRFIs, LFIs, if that's how you've\nheard them before, very dangerous.\n\n47\n00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.230\nWe'll also look at privilege escalation\nonce we've gained access to the box.\n\n48\n00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.210\nMaybe we're not administrators, per se?\n\n49\n00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.610\nWe want to bump that privilege up, so\n\n50\n00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.510\nwe're gonna use privilege\nescalation techniques for that.\n\n51\n00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.070\nWe're gonna take a look at SQL injection,\nbecause if you don't know your SQL\n\n52\n00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.870\ninjection, well, then you're coming\nlate to the party ladies and gentleman.\n\n53\n00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.520\nSo we're gonna give you a good base\nfoundation knowledge on how to do SQL\n\n54\n00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.380\ninjection attacks in\nyour penetration testing.\n\n55\n00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.050\nAlso take a look at password cracking.\n\n56\n00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.710\nIt's like a day without sunshine if\nwe haven't cracked a password when it\n\n57\n00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.810\ncomes to hacking, right?\n\n58\n00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.850\nOr penetration testing should I say.\n\n59\n00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.090\nAlso looking at network\nservice proof force attacks.\n\n60\n00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.360\nAnd finally, port redirection to\nget around those pesky firewalls.\n\n61\n00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.320\nSo a lot of really in depth and\nbroad information that\n\n62\n00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.140\nshould build you a great foundation for\ndoing your own penetration testing.\n\n63\n00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel,\nthose sound like some exciting topics.\n\n64\n00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.270\nI'm excited, hopefully everybody\nout there is as excited as I am.\n\n65\n00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.390\nCan't wait to get started,\n\n66\n00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.840\ncan't wait to see you with us here for\npenetration testing.\n\n67\n00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.249\n[SOUND]\n\n",
