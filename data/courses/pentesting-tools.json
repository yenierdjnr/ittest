00:00:13.125\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:18.230\nNow we're gonna take a look at how we can\nset up a lab, to do penetration testing.\n\n5\n00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.630\nAnd we've had a lot of episodes\nabout doing penetration testing, and\n\n6\n00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.600\na lot of episodes about like Kali and\nMetasploit, and things like that.\n\n7\n00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.190\nBut how do you practice all those?\n\n8\n00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.050\nHow do you sit at home, and try this\nwithout destroying your own home network,\n\n9\n00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.077\nor worse, doing something you're\ndefinitely not supposed to do, and\n\n10\n00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:36.620\nthat is venture outside and\n\n11\n00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.930\ntry this against places,\nthat you don't have permissions to.\n\n12\n00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.140\nSo let's see how a professional\npen tester, sets up a lab.\n\n13\n00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.910\nSo Sean, what you got for us today?\n\n14\n00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:46.640\nWhere do we even start?\n\n15\n00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.430\n>> Apparently nothing, because you're\nwaiting for a profession to get in here.\n\n16\n00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.620\nThat clearly is not me.\n\n17\n00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.390\n[LAUGH]\n>> We didn't say you had to\n\n18\n00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.974\nact professional.\n\n19\n00:00:52.974 --> 00:00:55.550\n>> Oh well.\n>> We just said you could charge money\n\n20\n00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.360\nwhen you do this.\n\n21\n00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.350\n>> Oh, well, if that's all it takes,\nthen, yes, I qualify.\n\n22\n00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.710\n>> Yes.\n[LAUGH] So yeah,\n\n23\n00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.220\nwhat we're gonna talk about here is,\nhow you actually set up these labs,\n\n24\n00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.290\nor set up your own lab rather, in a way\nthat you can do your own testing in a safe\n\n25\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.940\nenvironment, and get used to kicking the\ntires, and using these tools in a way that\n\n26\n00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.760\nyou're not gonna get in trouble with the\nlaw, you're not gonna take something down.\n\n27\n00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.570\nYou're not gonna have someone\nknocking on your door.\n\n28\n00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.130\nYou're not gonna get punched, you know any\nof those things could be a bad result,\n\n29\n00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.130\nthat you don't want to happen.\n\n30\n00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.910\n>> The last time those black vans\npulled up in front of my house,\n\n31\n00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.196\nI mean it really scared the dogs.\n\n32\n00:01:33.196 --> 00:01:36.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah it can happen.\n\n33\n00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.990\n>> It is tough,\nwe want to play with all these cool tools.\n\n34\n00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.290\nWe want to try some this stuff, and\n\n35\n00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.970\nsometimes we're unleashing\nthings that are not safe.\n\n36\n00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.610\nAnd I don't want to, even at home I mean I\ndon't want to wipe out all my pictures, or\n\n37\n00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.440\nmy music or\ninfect all the machines at my network.\n\n38\n00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.800\nSo we really do need a way to isolate\nthat from everything else, keep it safe.\n\n39\n00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.860\nBut still give me the ability to\nsimulate going across networks,\n\n40\n00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.270\nand how can I do a firewalking\nif I've got one subnet, right?\n\n41\n00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.980\nThere's no fun.\n\n42\n00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.980\n>> Yeah.\nIf you just test on an individual machine,\n\n43\n00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.900\nand you don't have a lab, there's a number\nof bad outcomes that can come from that.\n\n44\n00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.080\nIt may be that first of all, and\nnot necessarily the nastiest thing you can\n\n45\n00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.100\nget, but it's really not gonna help you\nlearn, is where you are testing it, and\n\n46\n00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.550\nlike you said, firewalking.\n\n47\n00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.310\nWhat's that gonna get you if you're\non just a single machine, or\n\n48\n00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.020\nsomething doing that?\n\n49\n00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.170\nSo it's not gonna help\nyou out all that much.\n\n50\n00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.600\nSo just having a single machine\nis not really gonna help you out.\n\n51\n00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.190\nAnd the thing is,\nis that where do you go from there?\n\n52\n00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.190\nWhere do most people go from there,\nI guess is the way to really look at it.\n\n53\n00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.891\nYou see people go, when they have\na single machine, they're like,\n\n54\n00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:42.250\nwell I wanna test these tools out.\n\n55\n00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.850\nSo what do they do?\n\n56\n00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.210\nThey're looking for some place to test\nthem and they say oh no harm, no foul,\n\n57\n00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.710\nI'm just one person, let me start\ntargeting different IP addresses,\n\n58\n00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.560\nand different websites and\nstuff like that.\n\n59\n00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.880\nThey just starting figuring,\nit's fine to do whatever they want.\n\n60\n00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.410\nI kind of liken it to someone that's\ngot a shooting range, and they're set\n\n61\n00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.260\nup with cans or something out there and\npow, pow, like that doing type of stuff.\n\n62\n00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.805\nAnd that was me doing\nmy dramatic gun motion.\n\n63\n00:03:10.805 --> 00:03:11.850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n64\n00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.638\nI went from the knife to carrying a gun.\n\n65\n00:03:15.638 --> 00:03:20.100\n[LAUGH]\nSo, I liken it to someone having their own\n\n66\n00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.700\nopen area, range or whatever,\nand just shooting cans,\n\n67\n00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.530\nto all of a sudden they're like oh, well\nit's okay to go out in a parking lot or\n\n68\n00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.460\nsomething, put them on top of cars or\nsomething like that, and\n\n69\n00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.380\nstart shooting in a crowded neighborhood,\nthat's not acceptable.\n\n70\n00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.742\n>> You've been hanging out with Nate?\n\n71\n00:03:34.742 --> 00:03:35.350\n>> Yeah, well.\n\n72\n00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.410\n>> [LAUGH] So we've got to keep it legal.\n\n73\n00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.070\nWe want to keep everything safe, and\n\n74\n00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.840\nso my guess Sean, virtualization\nis probably where we're headed.\n\n75\n00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.300\n>> Oh, virtualization's gonna play\na very big role in your education.\n\n76\n00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.170\nIt's not gonna be the only\nthing you're gonna use, but\n\n77\n00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.700\nit's gonna play a very big role.\n\n78\n00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.870\nNow for virtualization, that's the first\nstep I would recommend that you go to,\n\n79\n00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.960\nbecause you can get a lot\nof work done there.\n\n80\n00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.500\nSo what you should do is choose your\nvirtualization software of choice,\n\n81\n00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.640\nI don't really have a preference myself.\n\n82\n00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.030\nI can go between Virtual Box and\nVMware for example.\n\n83\n00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.280\nThose are the two I tend to find\nmyself in the most of the time.\n\n84\n00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.870\nBut I know there's plenty\nof other options out there.\n\n85\n00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.500\nJust pick the one that you like.\n\n86\n00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.460\nThe one that you've got access to.\n\n87\n00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.290\n>> The one that's free.\n\n88\n00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.751\n>> One that's free would be a good one.\n\n89\n00:04:23.751 --> 00:04:25.506\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's always nice, yeah.\n\n90\n00:04:25.506 --> 00:04:26.677\nLike Virtual Box is free.\n\n91\n00:04:26.677 --> 00:04:27.438\nVMWare has what?\n\n92\n00:04:27.438 --> 00:04:28.082\nThe VM Player?\n\n93\n00:04:28.082 --> 00:04:28.960\n>> The VM Player, yeah-\n\n94\n00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.480\n>> Is\n>> It's free.\n\n95\n00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.690\nIt's a little bit limited but it's free.\n\n96\n00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.250\nVirtualBox is free and it's a really\na relatively intuitive one to use,\n\n97\n00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.540\nif you're new to virtualization.\n\n98\n00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.090\nAnd if you're running Windows,\nlike Windows 8.1 or something like that,\n\n99\n00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.810\nyou can actually install client Hyper-V,\n\n100\n00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.770\nwhich is a little more complex, but you\nknow we've got some good episodes on that.\n\n101\n00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.304\nAnd the nice thing about\nusing client side Hyper-V,\n\n102\n00:04:50.304 --> 00:04:53.460\nis that You're getting familiar with\nHyper-V and it's something that transports\n\n103\n00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.400\nright over to the server environment,\ncuz it's the exact same product.\n\n104\n00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.420\nYou can actually build machines in\nclient side Hyper-V, export them and\n\n105\n00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.630\nimport them into a production\nenvironment for example,\n\n106\n00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.630\nso you're actually getting\ntwo benefits there, right?\n\n107\n00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.790\nYou're setting up a test lab for\nyour penetration, as well as studying for\n\n108\n00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.420\nyour Hyper-V exam,\nif that's what you're wanting to do.\n\n109\n00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.930\nSo, bunch of choices.\n\n110\n00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.380\nPick the one that's right for you.\n\n111\n00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.200\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n112\n00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.060\nSo, whatever you have access to, you know,\ngo ahead and, you know, use that one.\n\n113\n00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.690\nThe only caution I give you is, just to\nremember that some of them are limited,\n\n114\n00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.400\nand some of them really aren't designed\nto work within the environment we have.\n\n115\n00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.220\nI don't even know,\nI haven't even looked in a long time.\n\n116\n00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.090\nI can't even remember if virtual\nPCs are even available anymore.\n\n117\n00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.720\n>> I don't believe so.\n\n118\n00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.840\nI think that died off and virtual servers\nare gone as well, I'm pretty sure.\n\n119\n00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.328\n>> Good, because now they-\n>> Yeah,\n\n120\n00:05:43.328 --> 00:05:47.858\nnow they got the client Hyper-V so\nthey figure that's good enough.\n\n121\n00:05:47.858 --> 00:05:49.360\n>> Yeah.\nSo there you go.\n\n122\n00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.110\nThe only reason I threw those names out\nthere is, I haven't used them in awhile\n\n123\n00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.070\nbecause they just don't even come close\nto suiting the needs I want them for, and\n\n124\n00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.030\nthat's what most people\nfound out with them too.\n\n125\n00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.930\nIf you had access to those, which it\nappears you don't have access to them\n\n126\n00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.900\nanymore, it wouldn't be the best choice.\n\n127\n00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.490\nYou know, so do think about that.\n\n128\n00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.690\nProbably, if you're talking free,\nyou're gonna talk Virtual Box,\n\n129\n00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.110\nyou're gonna talk the VMware Player.\n\n130\n00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.250\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or you know Hyper-V,\n\n131\n00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.750\nif you want to go that route.\n\n132\n00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.620\nSo you've got some options there.\n\n133\n00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.870\n>> So.\n>> And let me just throw out here,\n\n134\n00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.370\nthe downside of doing client side Hyper-V,\nit's not like VirtualBox,\n\n135\n00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.610\nwhere it's an application running on\nyour system that you've downloaded.\n\n136\n00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.970\nThat's the thing about VirtualBox,\n\n137\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.410\nit's easy to get rid of\nwhen you're done with it.\n\n138\n00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.280\nClient side Hyper-V will actually\ninstall like a feature on Windows 8.1.\n\n139\n00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.710\nYou have to reboot the machine a couple\ntimes, cuz it's loading up that type one\n\n140\n00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.700\nhypervisor that gets in between your\nhardware, and your base operating system.\n\n141\n00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.480\nYour base operating system basically\nbecomes a virtualized guest.\n\n142\n00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.810\nIt might be a little\nmore than what you want,\n\n143\n00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.730\nit depends on really what you want to do.\n\n144\n00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.720\nKeep that in mind if you're just doing\nthis as a test, and you want to get rid of\n\n145\n00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.058\nit and you don't want to mess up\nyour only computer at your house.\n\n146\n00:07:04.058 --> 00:07:06.230\nClient Hyper-V might\nbe more than you want.\n\n147\n00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.210\n>> Good point, good point.\n\n148\n00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.650\nIn fact, something to kind of put\nmore on top of that, would be that,\n\n149\n00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:20.030\nthat could potentially, just what you said\nthere, as far as having VirtualBox and\n\n150\n00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.460\nVMware and then having Hyper-V come in at\na different angle on the whole solution,\n\n151\n00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.570\nthat could actually\nchange your results when\n\n152\n00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.050\nyou start really getting into the weeds\nwith some of the hacking we do.\n\n153\n00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.020\nSo you might wanna keep that\none in mind when you do this.\n\n154\n00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.270\nIt might not be a bad idea\nto load it at some point,\n\n155\n00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.080\njust to see what the results\nare when you get that far.\n\n156\n00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:44.130\nThe reality is, that's gonna help you not\nonly from the sense of setting up the lab,\n\n157\n00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:48.630\nto have something that you can easily just\ntake out and replace a virtual machine or\n\n158\n00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.970\nrebuild or whatever you need, and\n\n159\n00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.700\nnot have to have a bunch of physical\nmachines to do it at this point.\n\n160\n00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.715\nBut you also have something that\na lot of businesses are using, so\n\n161\n00:07:56.715 --> 00:08:00.146\nyou can kind of walk around it and\nnot only test on it, but\n\n162\n00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:03.066\nkind of Look to see what\ntype of results you get.\n\n163\n00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:06.830\nSo when you go the real world and\nstart doing your real pen testing on live\n\n164\n00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.658\nsystems, you'll know how to sniff\naround and poke around and find out if\n\n165\n00:08:10.658 --> 00:08:15.160\nyou're actually on a physical box or\nyou've gotten into a virtual machine.\n\n166\n00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:20.740\nSo that could pay dividends there, so just\nto kind of throw that into the whole mix.\n\n167\n00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.430\nOkay, so once you've decided on\nyour virtualization solution,\n\n168\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.560\nthen you need to get some operating\nsystems to put in there, and\n\n169\n00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.370\nthe question is what operating\nsystems do you need?\n\n170\n00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.540\nOkay, as far as the host operating system\neverything's getting installed on,\n\n171\n00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.130\nthat's kind of up to you to do.\n\n172\n00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:40.940\nYou notice in here for my host\noperating system what I use is I use,\n\n173\n00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.760\nI've got Windows 8.1.\n\n174\n00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.770\nBut that's what I use here.\n\n175\n00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.610\nI also have Linux systems that I use for\ndoing this.\n\n176\n00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.350\nThey both support virtualization.\n\n177\n00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.760\nI can put the stuff in there and\ndo what I need to.\n\n178\n00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.530\nSo they're both fine for that.\n\n179\n00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.180\nAs far as what you're gonna use for\nyour guest operating systems though,\n\n180\n00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.910\ncuz that's probably where you're gonna be\ndoing a lot of your work is inside those\n\n181\n00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:04.880\nguest operating systems, the virtualized\npart, you should be getting,\n\n182\n00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.760\nI would definitely say you\nshould get Kali in there.\n\n183\n00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.750\nThat should be one of\nthe first things you get\n\n184\n00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:15.500\nbecause it's got everything pretty much\nyou need in it, at least to get started.\n\n185\n00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.860\nYou're gonna find out,\nafter you get Kali and get into it a bit,\n\n186\n00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.810\nyou're gonna say okay, well I wanna\nload this on, and this on, and\n\n187\n00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:25.180\nthis on because there's additional tools\nthat will be more helpful, absolutely.\n\n188\n00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:31.760\nLast count, there was over 400\nsome odd tools inside of Kali so\n\n189\n00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.200\nyou're gonna be in there for quite a bit\nif you're digging through all of them,\n\n190\n00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.540\nwhich, that's up to you\nif you wanna do that, but\n\n191\n00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.910\nyou should definitely take a sampling\nof each category of tool in there and\n\n192\n00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.360\nget really used to it and see what\nthat means to be in that category,\n\n193\n00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.030\nwhat type of results you\nget get used to that.\n\n194\n00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.260\nSo, at some point though,\nwhen you grow beyond Kali,\n\n195\n00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.840\nthe cool thing about it is there's\nplenty of tools to load on top of that.\n\n196\n00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.610\nAnd there's an endless sea of them that\nyou can load into that product and\n\n197\n00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:04.600\nreally get other types of features and\npower and what have you and flexibility.\n\n198\n00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.230\nThere's that, so\nthat's a really good thing to have.\n\n199\n00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:13.120\nAnd the reality is on top of all\nthat with Kali you're not going\n\n200\n00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.260\nto get that far in pen testing, at least\nfrom where I'm sitting, you're not\n\n201\n00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.170\ngonna get that far in pen testing\nwithout getting comfortable with Linux.\n\n202\n00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.600\nSo you can kill two birds with one\nstone by getting Kali Linux as,\n\n203\n00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.470\nit's a Linux operating system, yes,\n\n204\n00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:30.280\nbut it also has pen testing one, so\nyou're killing two birds with one stone.\n\n205\n00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.620\nSo once we have that, the other things\nyou should get is see if you can get your\n\n206\n00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:38.770\nhands on, and you can get your hands on\nversions of the Windows operating system.\n\n207\n00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.870\nWe put in another show,\nI don't have the link handy.\n\n208\n00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:42.840\n>> I'm trying to find it.\n\n209\n00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.970\n>> But, you know what I'm talking about?\n\n210\n00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:44.920\nThe virtual machines.\n\n211\n00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.270\nMicrosoft makes virtual\nmachines available for testing.\n\n212\n00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.820\nSo, you can have some available there,\n\n213\n00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.740\nif you happen to have access\nto something like MSDN.\n\n214\n00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.075\nYou've even got a broader range of\noperating systems available to you\n\n215\n00:10:58.075 --> 00:10:59.329\nfrom the Microsoft side.\n\n216\n00:10:59.329 --> 00:11:04.165\nAnd what you wanna do, is you wanna\nget used to poking around, testing,\n\n217\n00:11:04.165 --> 00:11:08.764\nbreaking, analyzing, whatever you\nwant to call it with everyone,\n\n218\n00:11:08.764 --> 00:11:12.970\nwith every one of the relevant\nWindows operating systems, and\n\n219\n00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:16.738\nI say relevant because that's\namount closes I can get.\n\n220\n00:11:16.738 --> 00:11:21.567\nI'm not going to be specific with version\nnumbers, I'm not going to say well,\n\n221\n00:11:21.567 --> 00:11:23.095\njust do seven and eight.\n\n222\n00:11:24.415 --> 00:11:28.815\nThat's not going to help now it's\nthe problem realistically going to be XP\n\n223\n00:11:28.815 --> 00:11:32.810\nforward and server side for\nabout that time frame forward.\n\n224\n00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:36.910\nIt's still gonna be\nsomewhere in that area.\n\n225\n00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.780\nSo get those, get used to testing on them,\n\n226\n00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.400\nget used to testing on ones\nwith different service packs.\n\n227\n00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.355\nGet those in your lab.\n\n228\n00:11:44.355 --> 00:11:46.415\nGet em set up,\nsee what they actually look like.\n\n229\n00:11:46.415 --> 00:11:48.355\nMicrosoft sets some up for you but\n\n230\n00:11:48.355 --> 00:11:52.275\nif you MSDN you can try em with\ndifferent combinations of stuff.\n\n231\n00:11:52.275 --> 00:11:55.275\nYou can try international versions,\nif you're gonna ever encounter those,\n\n232\n00:11:55.275 --> 00:11:57.330\nif you think you're gonna\nbe doing that sort of work.\n\n233\n00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.656\nSo, you gotta have at\nleast some Linux stuff and\n\n234\n00:12:00.656 --> 00:12:05.825\nyou gotta have some Windows stuff,\nboth on the client on the server side.\n\n235\n00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:11.640\nBeyond that, then it becomes what\nelse do you need to go into?\n\n236\n00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.610\nIf you do need to get into\nthe Android operating system,\n\n237\n00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:19.060\nthat's one that you can\ntake a quick look around.\n\n238\n00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:25.020\nIn fact, if you do, I thinks it's\nAndroid Developers or Android OS.\n\n239\n00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.250\nThey have every version for\ndownload as an ISO file.\n\n240\n00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:32.130\nI will tell you that if you do\ndownload those ISO files for\n\n241\n00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:36.950\nAndroid, don't get it in your head, unless\nyou're extremely comfortable with it,\n\n242\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:41.060\nthat you're just gonna be able to\ninstall like you do anything else.\n\n243\n00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.840\nAndroid does take a little more effort.\n\n244\n00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.760\nNot a ton, but it does take a little\nbit more effort and planing and\n\n245\n00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.730\na little tweaking to visualize.\n\n246\n00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.540\nSo, I'm just giving you a warning.\n\n247\n00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:55.460\nIt requires, it can require certain\nmemory settings to be in place.\n\n248\n00:12:55.460 --> 00:13:00.050\nIt can require certain partitioning\nto be done by in fact,\n\n249\n00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:03.470\nevery version of the Android\noperating system I have seen, and\n\n250\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:08.830\nyou can get them available back to I think\n1 something if you really get down to it.\n\n251\n00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.630\nAnd you can test against all of those.\n\n252\n00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.350\nBut if you load them,\n\n253\n00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:16.150\nthen you've gotta partition the actual\nvirtual drive you put them on.\n\n254\n00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:20.423\nAnd so if you don't remember how\nthat goes then time to brush up.\n\n255\n00:13:20.423 --> 00:13:22.050\n[LAUGH] So there's that.\n\n256\n00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:26.730\nAs far as the other guys out there, Unix,\n\n257\n00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:31.600\nthat's very much same deal as\nLinux will be, but then that\n\n258\n00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.210\nstill leaves the other group out in the\nmarketplace, which is the Apple products.\n\n259\n00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.110\nThe Apple stuff becomes a little tougher\n\n260\n00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:43.370\nbecause of the virtualization issues and\nstuff like that with it.\n\n261\n00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:47.480\nThose ones you actually might have to,\nto really get the best experience,\n\n262\n00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.540\nget the actual hardware for it.\n\n263\n00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.980\nThat's the downside on that part of it.\n\n264\n00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.160\nYou know, I'm not trying to pick\non Apple by making that statement.\n\n265\n00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.480\nBut, it's a little\ntrickier with their stuff,\n\n266\n00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.470\njust because of the way they\ncontrol things and handle it.\n\n267\n00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.322\nBut, since there are more\nof those appearing,\n\n268\n00:14:07.322 --> 00:14:10.590\nit is something that you\nare going to have to get used to.\n\n269\n00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:15.820\nI would say now if you could pick up\neven off of eBay even some of the older\n\n270\n00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:16.440\nApple hardware.\n\n271\n00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.460\nI'm not talking ancient technology,\n\n272\n00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.860\nI'm talking stuff that's only if\nsomeone's getting rid of their old stuff.\n\n273\n00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.970\nYou know, something that may be\na couple of years or so out of date,\n\n274\n00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.690\nyou get that at a cheaper price,\nyou know go for it.\n\n275\n00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:32.530\nIt still will give you a chance to do\nsome pen testing it against it, and\n\n276\n00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:35.190\nthen it would be easy just to upgrade\nyou skills to a newer version.\n\n277\n00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.760\nYou know, so,\nthat would be that side of it.\n\n278\n00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.500\nBut, as far as that goes, if you don't\nwant to make that investment in getting\n\n279\n00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.990\nsome Apple equipment to test on,\nthen you still can get by on\n\n280\n00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.950\ngrabbing a copy of BSD or something and\ndo, get quite a bit with that,\n\n281\n00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:55.780\nbecause remember,\nthe Mac OS has those underpinnings on it.\n\n282\n00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:00.710\nSo you can pretty much get the same\ntaste and feel to a certain degree, but\n\n283\n00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.650\nat some point you're really\ngetting into the weeds and\n\n284\n00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:08.050\nyou're gonna have to justget the stuff\nto do it and just bite the bullet and\n\n285\n00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.450\npay for it, you need to do acquire it.\n\n286\n00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:16.310\nSo that right there would be enough\nto get you starting on pen testing,\n\n287\n00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:19.840\nto start installing those things and\ngetting used to it.\n\n288\n00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.070\nIf you're going to get into Kali,\nstart poking around using the tools,\n\n289\n00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:28.240\nI would recommend if you start going\nthrough the portfolio of tools which\n\n290\n00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.990\nall of them are documented\nquite well on the Kali site.\n\n291\n00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:34.100\nThere's a documentation section on there.\n\n292\n00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.880\nAnd they document every\ntool in there pretty well.\n\n293\n00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.330\nThere's actually a wiki out there and\n\n294\n00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.610\nI wouldn't even bother\nrecommending it right now.\n\n295\n00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.580\nThere's a wiki on Kali that's being built.\n\n296\n00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.940\nAnd it doesn't have every tool documented.\n\n297\n00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.370\nIt actually only has one\nsmall section on it.\n\n298\n00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.169\nThey're in the process of building it.\n\n299\n00:15:51.169 --> 00:15:55.794\nYou know, so it's not really helpful quite\nyet, but later on you know you could\n\n300\n00:15:55.794 --> 00:15:59.331\ngoogle Kali, Linux, Wiki and\nyou'd find it quite easily.\n\n301\n00:15:59.331 --> 00:16:01.815\nAnd it'd be fully populated with stuff.\n\n302\n00:16:01.815 --> 00:16:04.705\nBut right now it's only got a small\nlist of things in there, so\n\n303\n00:16:04.705 --> 00:16:08.510\nit's better just to go to the Kali site,\nor to just Google the individual tools.\n\n304\n00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:12.210\nOr just experiment, you can figure\nout a lot of this stuff on your own,\n\n305\n00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:15.540\nonce you understand how\na category of tool works.\n\n306\n00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:20.140\nThat's why when I went through\nthe ethical hacking with you,\n\n307\n00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:24.340\nand heck if you read my\nbook as well on that,\n\n308\n00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:28.880\nyou'll see that I emphasize learning\nwhat a family of tool is supposed to do.\n\n309\n00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.910\nI don't focus specifically on a tool.\n\n310\n00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:35.010\nWhen I say for example sniffers, I don't\nsay well, here's how wireshark works,\n\n311\n00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.900\nand I don't just hit you in\nthe face with that right away and\n\n312\n00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.530\nsay let's take a look at wireshark.\n\n313\n00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.840\nNo, I talk about the what sniffing does,\nand what you can expect.\n\n314\n00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.730\nWhy it works, how it works, and\nactive and passive techniques, and\n\n315\n00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.140\nthings that can thwart you.\n\n316\n00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.100\nAnd then once we know those concepts,\nthen I can say,\n\n317\n00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.890\nokay let's go to an actual\nexample of one of these.\n\n318\n00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:56.240\nAnd once you know the concepts,\nyou can easily say okay, yeah I remember\n\n319\n00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.870\nthe concept, and so I don't know where\nthe buttons are in the interface.\n\n320\n00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.210\nI know how to use that.\n\n321\n00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:06.090\nSo, you can very easily get\ninto kind of moving around and\n\n322\n00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:08.556\nplaying around with those actual tools.\n\n323\n00:17:08.556 --> 00:17:10.815\nSo, there'd be that.\n\n324\n00:17:10.815 --> 00:17:14.440\nOnce you get familiar with Kali,\nand see what tools are there, and\n\n325\n00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.949\nmaybe poke around a couple systems, you\ncan see, if you really want to, you can\n\n326\n00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:22.540\nsee that, which tools are available on\nthe Windows side that are comparable.\n\n327\n00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.440\nSome of the tools that are in Kali,\nalso have Windows companions, but\n\n328\n00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.900\nnot all of them do.\n\n329\n00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:31.115\nThe ones that do,\nthings like obvious like, end map, and\n\n330\n00:17:31.115 --> 00:17:34.030\nnik-toe, and Nessus and stuff like that.\n\n331\n00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:38.050\nThey do have Windows companion,s but\nnot all of them do.\n\n332\n00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:42.340\nSo you do kind of, got to look at that,\nwhich if you do wanna have stuff on\n\n333\n00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:47.360\nthe Windows side, do remember by the way\nalso if you find all the stuff you need\n\n334\n00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.120\non the Windows side, and you're like okay,\ngood, I don't have to mess with Linux\n\n335\n00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.065\nbecause, maybe I understand when a lot of\npeople get new into ethical hacking and\n\n336\n00:17:54.065 --> 00:17:57.640\npen testing, they're like, if they're\nin the Windows world the whole time,\n\n337\n00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.380\nthey're like, I don't wanna get out\nof that sandbox, it's too safe.\n\n338\n00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.390\nWell first of all,\nyou gotta stop that line of thinking.\n\n339\n00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:04.490\nYou're gonna break stuff.\n\n340\n00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:06.010\nIt's good to break stuff, okay?\n\n341\n00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.810\nIt really is.\n\n342\n00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.760\nWhen you're doing this,\nit's good to break stuff,\n\n343\n00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:15.020\nbecause look at how you broke it, and\nyou can figure, dissect that problem.\n\n344\n00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.030\nThat's what you should treat it as,\nyou break something,\n\n345\n00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:17.900\nit's a learning opportunity.\n\n346\n00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.370\nIt's not something that, oh, I'm an idiot,\nand I shouldn't do this, and this is bad.\n\n347\n00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.860\nI should go to another platform, no no.\n\n348\n00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:26.180\nIt's a learning experience that's\nyour attitude, when you go into this.\n\n349\n00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.731\nSo it's a good thing, I encourage\nthat whenever I teach people this, or\n\n350\n00:18:29.731 --> 00:18:30.540\nget into it.\n\n351\n00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.850\nBreak it, if you haven't broken it you\nhaven't impressed me all that much.\n\n352\n00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.695\nCuz it means you weren't\ntrying hard enough.\n\n353\n00:18:34.695 --> 00:18:35.195\nOkay?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n354\n00:18:35.195 --> 00:18:36.645\n>> So that's just my attitude,\n\n355\n00:18:36.645 --> 00:18:40.937\ntrying to put my own spin on it.\nDidn't say go break random stuff,\n\n356\n00:18:40.937 --> 00:18:42.085\nyou know.\nIf you don't own it,\n\n357\n00:18:42.085 --> 00:18:43.100\nyou can't break it, okay.\nSo just remember that.\n\n358\n00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.310\n[CROSSTALK] >> So,\njust get ready to take your laptop and\n\n359\n00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.245\njust push it off the side there.\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n360\n00:18:47.245 --> 00:18:47.906\nI encourage.\n>> [SOUND]\n\n361\n00:18:47.906 --> 00:18:49.532\n>> I go that is great.\n\n362\n00:18:49.532 --> 00:18:51.665\n[LAUGH] You have a nice day.\n\n363\n00:18:51.665 --> 00:18:53.640\n[LAUGH] So\n\n364\n00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.945\nthat's something to remember on that.\n\n365\n00:18:55.945 --> 00:19:01.360\nBut don't be afraid to\ntest the waters of Linux,\n\n366\n00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.080\nand get in there and do stuff like I said,\nit's easy to rebuild, easy to do stuff.\n\n367\n00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:05.650\nIt breaks it.\n\n368\n00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.210\nFine.\nWe'll make another one.\n\n369\n00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.280\nIf you just get stuck in\nthe windows environment.\n\n370\n00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.314\nYou can do a lot in the Windows\nenvironment, much more than you used to,\n\n371\n00:19:12.314 --> 00:19:14.760\nas far as ethical hacking and\npen testing goes.\n\n372\n00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.520\nBut there's still some things\nthat either aren't available, or\n\n373\n00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.770\njust with the Windows\narchitecture cannot be done.\n\n374\n00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:23.240\nPeriod.\n\n375\n00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.480\nIt's not that someone hasn't built\na tool for it because they're lazy.\n\n376\n00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.540\nIt's that, there's no point in even\nattempting it because, the way Microsoft's\n\n377\n00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:34.660\narchitected the whole thing, that they\ncan't get in to do what they need to.\n\n378\n00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.170\nSo, not an issue.\n\n379\n00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.960\nNot something they're even gonna attempt.\n\n380\n00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.150\nLinux, they're a lot more open.\n\n381\n00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.300\nIt can do a lot more little tweaks and\nthings there,\n\n382\n00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.750\nand the evidence shows it on that side.\n\n383\n00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.140\nSo you are gonna have get\nused to going back and forth.\n\n384\n00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.130\nBut, I would recommend at least looking,\nto a certain degree,\n\n385\n00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.640\nto see if stuff is\navailable across platform.\n\n386\n00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.480\nIf you are someone that's on the Mac side,\n\n387\n00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.520\nthat's gonna be a frustrating\nexperience for you.\n\n388\n00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.790\nI'm just going to be honest about it.\n\n389\n00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:03.590\nIt's going to be a frustrating\nexperience for you.\n\n390\n00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.250\nIt's not meant to be a bashing thing,\nor anything like that.\n\n391\n00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:11.330\nIt's going to be a frustrating experience,\nbecause why the portfolio of tools for\n\n392\n00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:18.620\nhacking on the Mac side of things, and\ndoing all this good stuff over there.\n\n393\n00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.380\nIt's still not as broad as Windows is, and\n\n394\n00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.080\nit's definitely not as\nbroad as Linux itself is.\n\n395\n00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.040\nSo that's gonna limit you.\n\n396\n00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.000\nSo Sorry, you're gonna have to learn.\n\n397\n00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.128\nOver there, you're probably more\nthan likely going to have to learn,\n\n398\n00:20:31.128 --> 00:20:36.120\nvery least Kali,\nto get the most bang for your buck.\n\n399\n00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.120\nOkay, so, that's,\nthat's the kind of deal with the,\n\n400\n00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.190\njust to kind of testing the waters,\nand everything in here.\n\n401\n00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:45.150\nSo, you know, the question is,\nis once you get past,\n\n402\n00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:49.310\nto go back to one of the original\nthings here, the operating systems.\n\n403\n00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.560\nWhat other operating\nsystems might you look at?\n\n404\n00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:56.910\nI just gave you Linux, Unix,\nWindows, and then I said the stuff\n\n405\n00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:01.850\nI said about Apple, well are there any\nother things out there besides Kali?\n\n406\n00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:06.830\nWell, yeah, there are plenty of options,\nand I brought up some here on my screen.\n\n407\n00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:10.330\nThat kind of give you, you know some\npeeks around some of the stuff.\n\n408\n00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:17.230\nYou've got, you know here's,\nyou know Kali Linux, Kali Linux, Kali.org.\n\n409\n00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:18.930\nThis one is obviously the one,\n\n410\n00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:25.160\nyeah that we did you know a week's\nworth of classes, or courses on.\n\n411\n00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.540\nAnd we just kind of saw\nthe whole deal with it.\n\n412\n00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:32.920\nIt's a very good thing to get into,\nbecause it reaps a lot of dividends.\n\n413\n00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.400\nYou could make something like Kali on\nyour own by bringing all the tools in and\n\n414\n00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.550\ngetting an open distro, but\nit's gonna take you a lot of effort and\n\n415\n00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.210\nyou probably still wouldn't get\nall the exact same capabilities.\n\n416\n00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.950\nSomething also to note on this is,\n\n417\n00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:53.610\nthis thing's kind of doing its whole jazz\nof scrolling by and doing its animation.\n\n418\n00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:59.900\nIf you look at the Kali site, you'll\nnotice that they already are advertising\n\n419\n00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.840\nKali 2.0, which comes out on August 11th.\n\n420\n00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.910\nThat's when they're releasing that.\n\n421\n00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:09.200\nAnd so we'll do an update on that later.\n\n422\n00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.707\nBut you know, you still can\nuse a lot of the skills that.\n\n423\n00:22:11.707 --> 00:22:16.960\nYou can use any of the skills that\nwe showed you on the Kali side.\n\n424\n00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.260\nAnywhere in here, you can still use those.\n\n425\n00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.790\nThey've just done additional enhancements\non top of that, so that's kinda cool and\n\n426\n00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.340\nsomething I wanted to note.\n\n427\n00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:27.530\nAlso, Kali has distros that run on.\n\n428\n00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:31.660\nThey have a version called Kali Net\nHunter, which runs on portable platforms,\n\n429\n00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.710\nmobile platforms.\n\n430\n00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:36.146\nSo you can install that on your smart\nphone, you can install it on your tablet.\n\n431\n00:22:36.146 --> 00:22:38.680\nThere's all sorts of instructions for\nthat, totally free,\n\n432\n00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.260\nall you gotta do is\nbring your own hardware.\n\n433\n00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.960\nSo that's pretty neat too.\n\n434\n00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.360\nSo that's Kali.\n\n435\n00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:50.410\nOther ones we have there of note,\nwe have the Samurai web testing framework.\n\n436\n00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:54.580\nThis is another one that's\nbeen out there for a while.\n\n437\n00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:58.760\nThis is one that's used to\ndo various things as well.\n\n438\n00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:04.590\nIt's little more specialized than,\nthen Kali itself is.\n\n439\n00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:09.760\nKali is kind of a one size fits all,\nand that's not in a negative sense.\n\n440\n00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.150\nWhen usually you say one size\nfits all the implication is that,\n\n441\n00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:17.220\nit does a lot of things, but\nit doesn't necessarily do everything well.\n\n442\n00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:21.010\nKali seems to do just about\neverything well, with few exceptions.\n\n443\n00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:25.780\nAnd we can fill in those holes pretty\nquickly, to extend it even further.\n\n444\n00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.130\nSo it's pretty neat.\n\n445\n00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:29.680\nNow what this one does,\n\n446\n00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.910\nis this one, instead of trying to\ndo all the stuff that Kali's doing,\n\n447\n00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:40.390\nit focuses specifically on testing\nwebsites and web applications.\n\n448\n00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:41.685\nSo if your bread and\n\n449\n00:23:41.685 --> 00:23:45.610\nbutter's gonna be there, this may be\nsomething you wanna add to your tool kit.\n\n450\n00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:47.930\nOkay, so\njust kinda throwing that one out there.\n\n451\n00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:52.060\nAnd then there's another\none out here is CAINE.\n\n452\n00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.880\nCAINE is another distro\nthat we see out there.\n\n453\n00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.765\nThis is, that's really kinda\ngeared towards forensics.\n\n454\n00:24:00.765 --> 00:24:07.685\nSo why am I bringing this up\nin a Pen testing type deal.\n\n455\n00:24:07.685 --> 00:24:13.465\nWell the reason is, is that some of these\ntools we have here would be very handy for\n\n456\n00:24:13.465 --> 00:24:18.655\ndoing investigations of your systems,\nvarious systems to boot off of,\n\n457\n00:24:18.655 --> 00:24:23.580\nmaybe recover passwords off of\na system once you power it off.\n\n458\n00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.770\nThese would be very very nice\nthings to have available to you.\n\n459\n00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.420\nSo, that's just a couple of them.\n\n460\n00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.910\nThere are other ones outside of even this.\n\n461\n00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:36.960\nIf you really want to take a look and\nkind of let your fingers do the walking,\n\n462\n00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.660\nand get used to trying other things,\nyou can go to distrowatch.org.\n\n463\n00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.130\nAnd, I believe it's .org.\n\n464\n00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:46.175\nIf you go to distrowatch.org,\nyou can search for\n\n465\n00:24:46.175 --> 00:24:50.555\npen-testing distros or security distros.\n\n466\n00:24:50.555 --> 00:24:53.950\n>> They recently changed it to .com, but\nI think org will resolve to it anyway.\n\n467\n00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:57.740\n>> Okay, so it's still that website.\n\n468\n00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.240\nSo Mike's provided that for you.\n\n469\n00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:04.010\nThat website does have just a ton\nof distros on it, and so it's not,\n\n470\n00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:08.770\nit is worth your while to go up there and\nkind of peruse what they have and\n\n471\n00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:10.450\nsee what they've got.\n\n472\n00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:14.520\nYou know, that also brings me to\nsomething else with DistroWatch\n\n473\n00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.300\nthat you wanna look for.\n\n474\n00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:20.360\nYou've got these systems to test against,\nright?\n\n475\n00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.570\nSo you're going out and\ndownloading these systems.\n\n476\n00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:28.360\nNow, you download these systems,\nyou could go to a website like, you know,\n\n477\n00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.400\nI had this tab up here.\n\n478\n00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.190\nYou can go to SANS.\n\n479\n00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:36.650\nSANS provides, is one of many that provide\nguidance like I'm doing here as well.\n\n480\n00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:41.810\nThey provide a blue print for\ndoing your own pen-testing lab.\n\n481\n00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:42.530\nYou can set your own up.\n\n482\n00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:43.770\nOkay, that's great.\n\n483\n00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:45.460\nSo they provide that guidance.\n\n484\n00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:49.540\nAnd I wouldn't just take what I'm\nsaying as the only way to do it.\n\n485\n00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.940\nThere's other ways to set\nup a pen-testing lab.\n\n486\n00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:53.910\nWhen I set up mine and\n\n487\n00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:57.580\ndo my testing and all that,\nI look at a lot of different sources.\n\n488\n00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:01.260\nAnd I find myself combining\nthe guidance from all of them\n\n489\n00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:05.680\nto get something that is\nmore what I need it to be.\n\n490\n00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.650\nCount these as starting points or\n\n491\n00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:11.780\nstuff that if you still got\nquestions after we talk about this.\n\n492\n00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.020\nHow you can actually customize it and\n\n493\n00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.190\nother things you can do to\nkind of get the gears turning.\n\n494\n00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:18.370\nThat's what I would treat these as.\n\n495\n00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.340\nI'm sure being creative and\n\n496\n00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:24.865\ntrying stuff out you'll get somewhere\non it, so that would be that.\n\n497\n00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:30.490\nSo the thing would be though,\nis after you set up this lab and\n\n498\n00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:33.580\nyou get these Windows systems and\nLinux systems to beat on,\n\n499\n00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:39.230\nyou can get an isofile down from really\nany site that's hosting Linux or\n\n500\n00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:43.210\nhosting a, as a developer for Linux,\nyou can download the ISO file.\n\n501\n00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:47.710\nYou can download it off Distrowatch and\ninstall it through whatever your\n\n502\n00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:51.440\nvirtualization software is and try and\nkicking the tires and all that.\n\n503\n00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.780\nWell, that will get you some mileage and\nthat's what I want to see.\n\n504\n00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:59.950\nBut then the next stage for you is to\nget something like metasploitable.\n\n505\n00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:02.000\nMetasploitable or Metasploitable 2,\n\n506\n00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.030\nspecifically is when you saw\nduring our metasploit course and\n\n507\n00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:12.830\nduring our Kayli course and you've seen it\nyou know in the stuff we've done here too,\n\n508\n00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:18.300\noutside of those guys it's one\nof the vulnerable servers they\n\n509\n00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:23.460\nbuilt out there that has vulnerabilities\nthey put into it specifically\n\n510\n00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:28.120\nwith the idea that you can test against it\nand know what the vulnerabilities are, and\n\n511\n00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.630\nyou test against it knowing\nthe vulnerabilities there and say okay,\n\n512\n00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:33.810\nwhat does that look like if I\nknow that vulnerabilities there.\n\n513\n00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:38.300\nWhat do the results start to come back as\nif I probe it directly or if I poke it and\n\n514\n00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.500\nprod it different ways,\nwhat do the results look like?\n\n515\n00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.910\nHow do they change?\n\n516\n00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:46.990\nSo I know it's there, you know,\nI can double check and all that.\n\n517\n00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:50.640\nAnd it gets you, kind of put through your\npaces because that's all documented.\n\n518\n00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.960\nThey tell you where the results should\nbe and how they've configured stuff so\n\n519\n00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.960\nyou can kinda compare your\nstuff without knowing,\n\n520\n00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.340\nagainst what they already\ntold you on the back end.\n\n521\n00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.520\nIt's a good way to start with\ntraining wheels on in a nice,\n\n522\n00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.650\nsafe, stable controlled environment.\n\n523\n00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:05.830\nThey're not the only ones.\n\n524\n00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:12.720\nThere's a vulnerable version of\nLinux called Damn Vulnerable Linux,\n\n525\n00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.690\nwhich by the way is something that\nthey actually discontinued but\n\n526\n00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:18.650\nyou can still get it if you Google it.\n\n527\n00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:21.800\nDiscontinued just means they're\nnot updating it anymore.\n\n528\n00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.080\nThen there's also another one,\nit's Damn Vulnerable Web Application.\n\n529\n00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:29.570\nAnd it's designed to have, well,\nweb applications running on it, so\n\n530\n00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:32.180\nyou can pound on that and\nsee what's going on.\n\n531\n00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.880\nAnd then there's even a third\none that comes to mind and\n\n532\n00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.920\nthese aren't the end all\ndo all by any means.\n\n533\n00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:43.440\nThere's another one out there called\nWeb Goat that's been around forever and\n\n534\n00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.580\nyou can use that one too to test against.\n\n535\n00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:50.180\nAnd all those three are designed and\ndocumented is as far as for\n\n536\n00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:54.270\nrather, are all designed to be vulnerable\nand document what's vulnerable so\n\n537\n00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:59.240\nyou can know what to expect and\nget that most bang for your buck.\n\n538\n00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.300\nI mean at some point,\nyou may have to configure your own.\n\n539\n00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:06.100\nYou know there are tax against things like\ndomain controllers and stuff like that\n\n540\n00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:10.920\nI don't know of anybody that offers\na vulnerable domain controller out there.\n\n541\n00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.405\nWell actually I'm wrong about that\nthere is one, it's called Microsoft.\n\n542\n00:29:13.405 --> 00:29:15.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Kidding, kidding.\n\n543\n00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:18.822\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna get sued one of these days.\n\n544\n00:29:18.822 --> 00:29:20.249\n>> [LAUGH] Yes, yes you will.\n\n545\n00:29:20.249 --> 00:29:22.324\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] You'll walk out here and\n\n546\n00:29:22.324 --> 00:29:24.730\nBill's gonna be beating me.\n\n547\n00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.267\n>> Well Sean,\nthat's a ton of information already, and\n\n548\n00:29:27.267 --> 00:29:30.961\nwe really haven't set anything up yet,\nbut we unfortunately are out of time for\n\n549\n00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:34.790\nthis episode, which means we're going to\nhave to come back so we can continue on.\n\n550\n00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:37.100\nSo, let's go ahead and wrap it up here.\n\n551\n00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:37.850\nWe'll come back.\n\n552\n00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:40.350\nWe'll have another episode\nwhere we'll continue on.\n\n553\n00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:44.440\n>> This is not an episode.\n\n554\n00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.740\n>> Oh, okay.\n[COUGH] Well it's going to be a part 2.\n\n555\n00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:48.260\nHow do I?\n\n556\n00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.820\nOkay, I just won't call it an episode.\n\n557\n00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.980\nSo, you switched to the big screen?\n\n558\n00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:55.670\n>> Yeah.\n\n559\n00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:56.197\nI'll just talk?\n\n560\n00:29:56.197 --> 00:29:57.071\n>> Yeah.\n\n561\n00:29:57.071 --> 00:30:01.820\n>> All right Sean, we're about out of\ntime for this one, blah blah blah.\n\n562\n00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:02.710\nAnd, okay.\n\n563\n00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.050\nSo that's gonna do it for this one.\n\n564\n00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:08.494\nWe'll have more coming your way so\nstay tuned.\n\n565\n00:30:08.494 --> 00:30:08.994\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.555\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07.555 --> 00:00:10.636\nHello, in this how-to I've\ngot Sean Oriyano here, and\n\n3\n00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:15.320\nwe're going to take a look at setting up\na lab that we can use to perform pentest.\n\n4\n00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.150\nWe've talked about doing penetration\ntesting in a few of our other courses.\n\n5\n00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.770\nThis one, we wanna show you how\nyou could set something up,\n\n6\n00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.310\nto where you could this at home.\n\n7\n00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.580\nSo Sean, tell us what else we need.\n\n8\n00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.640\n>> Well, we've already covered quite a bit\nof ground on stuff we need to set up,\n\n9\n00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.490\nor set up at least to do our initial\ninvestigation and work with pen testing.\n\n10\n00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.660\nBut you're gonna need to get\ndeeper into it, obviously.\n\n11\n00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.590\nSo once you've mastered your operating\nsystems, and your software, and you've\n\n12\n00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.358\ngot a good feel for that, and I don't\nknow if you can say you truly master it.\n\n13\n00:00:50.358 --> 00:00:54.390\nYou know, your stuff evolves so quickly\nthat just by the time you think you got\n\n14\n00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.710\nit, it's like oh guess what, we got a new\nversion or a change, or something else.\n\n15\n00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.130\nSo, you gotta be adaptable, remember that.\n\n16\n00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.119\nSo, what we had prior was,\nwe had that virtual environment.\n\n17\n00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.870\nWhen you have that virtual environment it\ndoes provide that nice safe environment\n\n18\n00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.190\nto do things in.\n\n19\n00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.670\nIt does give you the ability to, if you\nbreak something to swap something in and\n\n20\n00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.010\nout really quickly.\n\n21\n00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.120\nAnd keep things rolling,\nthat's the big benefit of it.\n\n22\n00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.400\nHowever, to just make sure we're dotting\nour I's and crossing our T's here\n\n23\n00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.820\nyou're not gonna be able to do\neverything in that virtual environment.\n\n24\n00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.990\nJust to make it 100% clear, you can't do\neverything in that virtual environment.\n\n25\n00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.840\nYou will have to, by very nature,\nget used to using the physical stuff too.\n\n26\n00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.730\nAnd so what that means is you're\ngonna have to have a machine\n\n27\n00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.460\nthat at some point doesn't just\nhave in that virtual system,\n\n28\n00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.250\nit's got it physically installed\non hardware, and the reason for\n\n29\n00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.620\nthat is some of the hardware that you have\nthat you will plug in, just will plain and\n\n30\n00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.200\nsimple not work inside\nthe virtual environment.\n\n31\n00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.600\nFor example some of the adapters you have,\nlike I've got on\n\n32\n00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.580\nsome of the pentesting I do,\nI use special wireless adapters and\n\n33\n00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.260\nBluetooth adapters that can extend\nthe range or have additional capabilities\n\n34\n00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.810\nthat ones that are in the hardware itself\nsealed in at the factory don't have.\n\n35\n00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.240\nSo plug those in via USB.\n\n36\n00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.302\nWe know USB, work with USB,\nwe're comfortable with it.\n\n37\n00:02:24.302 --> 00:02:26.500\nProblem is, is that when you\nplug them into something and\n\n38\n00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.999\nthen let's say you're using\nVMware like I've been using.\n\n39\n00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.770\nVMware will allow you to attach\nto those USB devices, but\n\n40\n00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.530\nbecause of some of the nuances,\nI'll be nice about it.\n\n41\n00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.870\nSome of the nuances and\n\n42\n00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.310\nlittle things that happen at the hardware\nlevel of negotiating stuff, it'll work for\n\n43\n00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.800\neverything else, but it won't work for\ndoing some of the monitoring and\n\n44\n00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.250\nstuff that we need to pass back and\nforth for what we have.\n\n45\n00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.300\nSo you'll have to have a physical\nsystem to do a lot of these things on.\n\n46\n00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.990\nYou just, just part of necessity.\n\n47\n00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.520\nYou know, if you want to plug in,\nyou know, various USB devices,\n\n48\n00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.970\nanything really exotic, it's gonna start\ngetting more and more where you just have\n\n49\n00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.460\nto have a system that physically\nhas this installed and go for it.\n\n50\n00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.230\nBut, you know,\nif you've done your work with Linux, or\n\n51\n00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.600\nwhatever your favorite operating\nsystem's gonna be to pentest on,\n\n52\n00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.330\nif you've gotten comfortable with it\nenough, and kicked it around, and\n\n53\n00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.410\ndone all the stuff with it, and\nfound tools that work for you,\n\n54\n00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.130\nthen go ahead and try things out and\nuse whatever on there.\n\n55\n00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.730\nBut I have found, you know, for me I have\na Windows system I do this stuff on but\n\n56\n00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.120\nI also have to have a Linux system nearby.\n\n57\n00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.030\nI have, you know, coming out here, I've\ngot my windows system because it makes it\n\n58\n00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.830\nconvenient for doing the presentations and\ndoing a couple of other things and\n\n59\n00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.670\nI have my stuff virtualized because I'm\njust doing demonstrations of stuff, but\n\n60\n00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.920\nI also have my Linux stuff with me too.\n\n61\n00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.170\nI have a few things that are running\nthat and so I can switch over\n\n62\n00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.450\nreal easily if I have something\nspecifically that I get a question on or\n\n63\n00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.600\nneeds to be demonstrated, I have that.\n\n64\n00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.690\nAnd if I was doing this for a physical\npentest, those tools would absolutely be\n\n65\n00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.670\nthere with me with the rest of my,\nsome people call it a jump kit.\n\n66\n00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.230\nBut I've got a bag with\nall those things in it.\n\n67\n00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.400\nSo I can just go right out and\nhave my Linux stuff and\n\n68\n00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.180\nmy Windows stuff all ready to go.\n\n69\n00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.000\n>> Very good.\nAll right, so what's next, then?\n\n70\n00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.860\n>> Okay.\nSo let's talk about what your hardware\n\n71\n00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.970\nrequirements, and\nthe types of stuff you might need.\n\n72\n00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.630\nThat would be the very next thing.\n\n73\n00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.650\nIf you're running Linux, which I said\nprobably gonna be where you're going.\n\n74\n00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.750\nJust about all the tools,\nnice shiny pretty tools you're gonna want\n\n75\n00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.560\nto use are gonna be over on the Linux side\nand the adapters are gonna go with that.\n\n76\n00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.260\nYou're gonna need to\nget the right hardware.\n\n77\n00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.960\nWhat I strongly recommend that you\ndo is don't just go out there and\n\n78\n00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.490\npurchase your hardware, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.430\nWhat you want to do is you want to get a\ngood picture of the types of tools you're\n\n80\n00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.750\nusing and\n\n81\n00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.250\nsee if that particular platform supports\nthe range of options that you need.\n\n82\n00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.530\nGood examples of this,\nif you get into, if you\n\n83\n00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.500\never get into pen-testing using Android\ndevices, would be a really nice example.\n\n84\n00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.293\nYou do pen-testing with that,\nwell they have wi-fi and\n\n85\n00:05:15.293 --> 00:05:18.434\nthey have bluetooth built into them,\nif you want to do any sort of\n\n86\n00:05:18.434 --> 00:05:21.896\nhacking involving those things,\nyou have to use external adapters.\n\n87\n00:05:21.896 --> 00:05:26.600\nBecause the built-in wi-fi for example\ndoes not support what they call monitor\n\n88\n00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.710\nmode, it's more or less like wireless'\nversion of promiscuous mode.\n\n89\n00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.670\nI know there's some differences and\ndon't [LAUGH] don't go crazy on me, I know\n\n90\n00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.100\nthere's differences, I'm just keeping\nit short and brief right now on that.\n\n91\n00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.290\nBut the ones that are built into\nthe devices don't support monitor mode for\n\n92\n00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.440\nthe most part, but\nthere are some exceptions.\n\n93\n00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.940\nAnd one of them would be, for example, the\nNokia M900 is an older model cellphone.\n\n94\n00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.630\nIt does actually support that, and\nyou can install Linux on it and\n\n95\n00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.360\ndo your pen testing with it.\n\n96\n00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.590\nIf you didn't want to have an external\nadaptor hanging off your device,\n\n97\n00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.240\nif that's a big deal to you, then you\nmight have to do a lot more investigation,\n\n98\n00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.120\nrather than just buying the phone that\nyou can install, you know, K-lee, or\n\n99\n00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.210\nwhatever your distralytics is on.\n\n100\n00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.180\nYou're gonna have to find to not\nonly install that but does it so\n\n101\n00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.160\ndoes the wireless adapter on there\nsupport the mode that I need or\n\n102\n00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.280\ndo I have to plug an external?\n\n103\n00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.080\nThat's something that you want to\nconsider you do not want to buy\n\n104\n00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.010\na piece of hardware and\nfind out that it doesn't suit your needs.\n\n105\n00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.770\nIt's kind of not as easy as it\nused to be to have that happen.\n\n106\n00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.530\nWhere you get the wrong hardware or\nyou get hardware that doesn't do all your,\n\n107\n00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.530\nall your stuff doesn't match\nall the tools you need.\n\n108\n00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.350\nIt used to be a lot easier to do that.\n\n109\n00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.640\nNow its a lot harder to find\nsomething that's incompatible.\n\n110\n00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.640\nBut it does help to look at stuff\nlike the wireless adapters, and\n\n111\n00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.870\nstuff like that,\nbecause that's gonna be the big thing.\n\n112\n00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.560\nAs far as other resources,\nmemory, hard drive,\n\n113\n00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.430\nthose ones you can pretty much get away\nwith if you're doing, Linux especially,\n\n114\n00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.400\ncan get away with a lot less than you\nwould for a comparable Windows system.\n\n115\n00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.290\nEspecially if you're not going to throw\nin virtualization or anything like that.\n\n116\n00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.310\nI'm not saying go grab something that\nthey blow a pile of dust off of it and\n\n117\n00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.710\nsaid here you go, but you could get\naway with something that's older\n\n118\n00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.270\nif you want to save a few dollars on it.\n\n119\n00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.750\nIt will work just fine, get the job done.\n\n120\n00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.430\nWhereas if you're going to use\nWindows as your operating system and\n\n121\n00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.360\nyou're going to start stacking\na lot of stuff on it,\n\n122\n00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.910\nthen that becomes a little more or\na lot more of an issue.\n\n123\n00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.190\nYou're not going to take a system\nthat was built for XP and\n\n124\n00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.430\nload one of the newer\nversions of Windows on it.\n\n125\n00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.020\nIt'll work, but it'll really bog down just\nby putting the operating system on it.\n\n126\n00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.650\nAnd then when you put all the extra\nstuff that actually you can use to get\n\n127\n00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.170\nyour job done, then its a no go.\n\n128\n00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.900\nSo I have found that I can, if I'm using\nLinux, gives me a lot more flexibility.\n\n129\n00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.960\nAs anyone will tell you who uses Linux,\nit's not a resource hog,\n\n130\n00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.740\nit's very very gentle on\nthe resources you have.\n\n131\n00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.848\nYou can't go barebones, but\nyou can get pretty close to that.\n\n132\n00:07:57.848 --> 00:08:03.169\nHardware I acquire,\nhardware off of Ebay quite often.\n\n133\n00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:08.050\nIf I need a new notebook, and specifically\nfor a certain job or certain use,\n\n134\n00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.175\nI'll quite frankly grab\none that I find on sale,\n\n135\n00:08:11.175 --> 00:08:15.469\nlike one of the small little small\nones that are like 400 bucks.\n\n136\n00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:20.390\nI don't need to spend a few grand on\nsomething, I can get something that's like\n\n137\n00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:24.350\n400 bucks, plug my adapters into it and\nbe ready to go and I'm done.\n\n138\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.840\nSome clients want the device with all\nthe tools and all that stuff on it and\n\n139\n00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.600\nthe reports and everything on it,\nI've had that happen a couple times.\n\n140\n00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.963\nJust hand it to them, bill them for\nthe thing, I'll charge them like 1000.\n\n141\n00:08:34.963 --> 00:08:37.260\n>> [LAUGH] I gotta make\na profit somewhere right.\n\n142\n00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.370\n>> Wherever I can squeeze it, I'm\noperating on razor-thin margins, people.\n\n143\n00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:45.100\nBut that's something that you could do.\n\n144\n00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.960\nHeck, I just got this notebook here\nthat I'm using, I got this off of\n\n145\n00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.830\neBay not too long ago, wiped it clean and\ndid all the stuff I needed to it.\n\n146\n00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.880\nIt was perfectly fine,\nzero problems with it.\n\n147\n00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.230\nIf you're gonna be doing cell\nphone hacking at any point, and\n\n148\n00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.350\nI know that's the next\nbig thing to consider.\n\n149\n00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.600\nIf you're gonna do any sort of things\nmessing with those devices cuz we talked\n\n150\n00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.220\na lot during the CASP and other places\nabout managing mobile devices and\n\n151\n00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.580\nsecurity issues.\n\n152\n00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.330\nBy nature,\n\n153\n00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.730\nyou're gonna have to expand your lab to\ninclude those types of devices as well.\n\n154\n00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:20.530\nFortunately, you can pick up\ndevices off of eBay pretty cheaply.\n\n155\n00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.910\nI would recommend that you\nconsider doing that at some point.\n\n156\n00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:27.830\nGrab a couple devices off there,\ngrab a tablet or two,\n\n157\n00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:32.010\ncouple different models, and poke around\nand try to see how you could hack those.\n\n158\n00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:36.200\nAnd the cool thing about it is if you\nget something off of Ebay from someone,\n\n159\n00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.530\nnot only can you get it cheap, but you've\nalso got something that it's, hey you own\n\n160\n00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.952\nit now, you don't have to worry about\nbeing under warranty usually at any point.\n\n161\n00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.870\nGo ahead, unlock it, root it, break it.\n\n162\n00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.580\nWhatever it is, you can fix it.\n\n163\n00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.470\nI'm not saying brick\nit where it's dead and\n\n164\n00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:57.090\nit becomes a paperweight, I'm saying\nthat you can do a lot more stuff on it.\n\n165\n00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.770\nYou can be more comfortable that I didn't\npay the full price for it or anything.\n\n166\n00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:06.250\nGo ahead and kick the tires and have some\nfun and really kind of learn this stuff.\n\n167\n00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:11.221\nBut that's just the talking\nabout the computing device, and\n\n168\n00:10:11.221 --> 00:10:13.910\ncuz we already talked about the software\nand the virtualization part so\n\n169\n00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:19.070\nwe got the computing device covered,\nwe've got the mobile devices covered.\n\n170\n00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.730\nSo what else could possibly\ncome into the picture?\n\n171\n00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:25.150\nThere's actually a lot of\nthings on that front, too.\n\n172\n00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:29.700\nIt really kind of depends on how\nfar you want to get into it.\n\n173\n00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.220\nYou can really, really,\nreally dig into this.\n\n174\n00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:37.070\nSome of the stuff that I will tell you\nto go to to get additional tools and\n\n175\n00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:41.500\nto peek at stuff they have, what I have up\non my screen here is one of the sites that\n\n176\n00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.940\nyou can go to to find different\nlittle gadgets and stuff like that.\n\n177\n00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.840\nThis is something called\nthe Hacker Warehouse.\n\n178\n00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.640\nIt's hacker, singular, not plural.\n\n179\n00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:57.017\nThis one you can go to,\nthey've got plenty of stuff up here that\n\n180\n00:10:57.017 --> 00:11:02.291\nyou can see if it's gonna fit\nany requirements that you have,\n\n181\n00:11:02.291 --> 00:11:05.656\nI mean all sorts of interesting stuff.\n\n182\n00:11:05.656 --> 00:11:09.381\nYou can see they've got stuff for RF\nhacking if that's something you're into,\n\n183\n00:11:09.381 --> 00:11:11.920\nI know a lot of people\nlike doing that nowadays.\n\n184\n00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.520\nThere's some wireless stuff,\n\n185\n00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:19.370\nI mean some of the adapters they have up\nhere like this alpha 802.11 one, that's\n\n186\n00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:24.290\nsomething that is been popular for a long\ntime because of the range it gives you.\n\n187\n00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.167\nIf you need, of course you see they have\nlock picks on their too if you're in\n\n188\n00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:30.674\nthat sort of thing, if you like\nstalking your significant other or\n\n189\n00:11:30.674 --> 00:11:32.093\nsomething, this is the place to go.\n\n190\n00:11:32.093 --> 00:11:35.527\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Then there's the Ubertooth One's\n\n191\n00:11:35.527 --> 00:11:38.982\nanother one, you can see it right\nhere kinda near the middle or\n\n192\n00:11:38.982 --> 00:11:40.680\ntop middle of my screen.\n\n193\n00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.324\nYou'll see that that Ubertooth One,\n\n194\n00:11:43.324 --> 00:11:48.030\nthat is a special Bluetooth\npenetration testing device.\n\n195\n00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.950\nIt's one that gives you a long range and\n\n196\n00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.980\nalso gives you the ability\nto customize and do stuff.\n\n197\n00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.400\nIt's one of the few things you can get\nto do Bluetooth penetration testing\n\n198\n00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.000\nat that price point.\n\n199\n00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.200\nTypically it's been, it's getting better,\nbut it used to be to do penetration\n\n200\n00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.520\ntesting against Bluetooth devices, you\nwere gonna spend several thousand dollars\n\n201\n00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.050\nto get into that area because\nit had specialized equipment.\n\n202\n00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:15.790\nNowadays it's coming down more and\nmore in price all the time,\n\n203\n00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:18.080\nso this is just one example of it.\n\n204\n00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.590\nSo they've got a lot of stuff\nbeing written for that.\n\n205\n00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.040\nBut you can go through this and\nfind all sorts of stuff,\n\n206\n00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.070\nI'm just showing one single page here.\n\n207\n00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:28.388\nThey've even got stuff on here,\n\n208\n00:12:28.388 --> 00:12:31.230\nthey got pre-made rainbow\ntables if you wanna do that.\n\n209\n00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.700\nSo that would be one.\n\n210\n00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.060\nThere's another one,\nthis Wall of Sheep site,\n\n211\n00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.070\njust to show you another one\nthat's got stuff out there.\n\n212\n00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.270\nIt's got different tools and stuff like\nthat up there that you can do stuff with.\n\n213\n00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:46.779\nAnd remember by the way just as a word of\ncaution, and also for us to make sure that\n\n214\n00:12:46.779 --> 00:12:51.010\nheck, we told you so, so\ndon't getting yourself into any trouble.\n\n215\n00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:54.422\nJust because they will sell it to\nyou doesn't mean it's legal for\n\n216\n00:12:54.422 --> 00:12:56.544\nyou to own in your specific area, okay.\n\n217\n00:12:56.544 --> 00:13:00.130\nA lot of these sites you go to,\nthey'll sell it to you.\n\n218\n00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:04.430\nYou can go up here right now and buy\nstuff like, they have lockpicks up here.\n\n219\n00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.923\nLockpicks are one of those things that\nI know, I don't know how, for example,\n\n220\n00:13:07.923 --> 00:13:09.486\nit would be out here in Florida, but\n\n221\n00:13:09.486 --> 00:13:12.270\nI would acquaint myself if I was\ngonna bring those things here.\n\n222\n00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:17.292\nBut if you go from California to Nevada,\nyou go between those two,\n\n223\n00:13:17.292 --> 00:13:22.400\nCalifornia, having a set of lock\npicks on you is not illegal.\n\n224\n00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.260\nIt doesn't establish anything other\nthan you have a set of lock picks.\n\n225\n00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.820\nIt would be that if they\nfound stolen merchandise and\n\n226\n00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.310\nstuff like that or whatever,\nStolen stuff on you and those lock picks,\n\n227\n00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.927\nthey're gonna say,\nthat shows that you did that,\n\n228\n00:13:35.927 --> 00:13:39.217\nthat shows additional weight to\nthe fact that you committed this.\n\n229\n00:13:39.217 --> 00:13:41.744\nWhereas if you go over to Nevada,\n\n230\n00:13:41.744 --> 00:13:45.718\nNevada just having possession\nof them doing squat,\n\n231\n00:13:45.718 --> 00:13:50.980\nin Nevada you just, if you have that,\nit's against the law period.\n\n232\n00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.700\nJust possession of them, that's it.\n\n233\n00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.430\nI don't know if it's a felony or\nanything like that, but\n\n234\n00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:58.720\njust possession of it will get you\nin trouble with the law, period.\n\n235\n00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.240\nSo, that's a case where they will\nstill sell it to you there, and\n\n236\n00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.920\nthey tell you when they sell it to\nyou you're the one responsible for\n\n237\n00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.750\ndoing this, for holding this and\nchecking your stuff out.\n\n238\n00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.900\nIf you don't know that,\nthen that's on you.\n\n239\n00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.740\nSo do remember that when you get\nthis stuff, cuz I don't wanna see\n\n240\n00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:19.735\nanyone getting in trouble or calling us up\nlater on, but you said, no we didn't say.\n\n241\n00:14:19.735 --> 00:14:23.538\n[LAUGH] What we're saying is hey,\nGoogle is your best friend, and\n\n242\n00:14:23.538 --> 00:14:26.799\nyour local police department's\nyour best friend too.\n\n243\n00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:30.267\nCall them up and find out if you\ncan possess the stuff or not, so\n\n244\n00:14:30.267 --> 00:14:33.520\nask around before you buy\nsomething if you're not sure.\n\n245\n00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.808\nSo, and of course the other\nplace to go would be Ebay.\n\n246\n00:14:37.808 --> 00:14:42.660\nI have found on Ebay a lot of stuff\nup here that's just hiding out.\n\n247\n00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.155\nIf you do type in terms\nlike digital forensics, for\n\n248\n00:14:46.155 --> 00:14:50.525\nexample, hacking's a little tougher one.\n\n249\n00:14:50.525 --> 00:14:53.225\nBut if you type in some of this,\nif you type in hacking,\n\n250\n00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:55.865\nusually you get all sorts of stuff.\n\n251\n00:14:55.865 --> 00:15:00.040\nType in Hacking,\nyou find a bunch of axes up there.\n\n252\n00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you find,\n\n253\n00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:07.680\nyou've got these, you've got\ndifferent things on that pop up here.\n\n254\n00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.083\nIf you put in penetration testing or,\n\n255\n00:15:12.083 --> 00:15:17.181\nif I knew how to spell\npenetration testing.\n\n256\n00:15:17.181 --> 00:15:22.197\nIf you put that in, who knows,\nyou'll start getting various things.\n\n257\n00:15:22.197 --> 00:15:26.895\nI mean books and stuff like that come up,\nbut you'll find tools up there.\n\n258\n00:15:26.895 --> 00:15:33.024\nI have found our special adapters for\ndoing WiFi hacking up here,\n\n259\n00:15:33.024 --> 00:15:39.385\nI found all sorts of gadgets hiding\nup here, so worth checking out.\n\n260\n00:15:39.385 --> 00:15:40.845\nAnd then you even have stuff like this.\n\n261\n00:15:40.845 --> 00:15:43.285\nIf you wanna do another thing,\nif you wanna do Bluetooth hacking,\n\n262\n00:15:43.285 --> 00:15:45.725\nwhich a lot of people get into,\nyou got stuff like this too.\n\n263\n00:15:45.725 --> 00:15:48.025\nI own one of these myself.\n\n264\n00:15:48.025 --> 00:15:52.629\nThis is a, Sena makes this,\nthis is a UD100 Bluetooth adapter, and\n\n265\n00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:54.795\nit gives you substantial range.\n\n266\n00:15:54.795 --> 00:15:59.461\nIt's a Bluetooth 4 adapter, and\nyou can see in here this one,\n\n267\n00:15:59.461 --> 00:16:04.110\nit says right out of the box,\nit supports 300 meters.\n\n268\n00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.564\nOf wireless transmission.\n\n269\n00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:09.790\nSo for us here in the U.S.,\nthat's like 200 miles, I think.\n\n270\n00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.410\nI don't know.\n\n271\n00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.682\nMy math may be off a bit,\nbut I'm not sure.\n\n272\n00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:15.194\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n273\n00:16:15.194 --> 00:16:17.828\n>> I think I'm right, somewhere in there.\n\n274\n00:16:17.828 --> 00:16:18.863\nEven says on here,\n\n275\n00:16:18.863 --> 00:16:23.070\nit says you can extend it up to 1,000\nmeters using a special antenna.\n\n276\n00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.800\nThat they sell for you.\n\n277\n00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.450\nThey'll sell to you if you want.\n\n278\n00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:29.670\nSo they've got that.\n\n279\n00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:33.510\nAnd so these are things you wanna start\nkind of familiarizing yourself with,\n\n280\n00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.110\nbecause you will be\nmoving into these spaces.\n\n281\n00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.605\nI can tell you that when\nyou do pen testing,\n\n282\n00:16:37.605 --> 00:16:40.385\nyou're gonna move from doing,\njust knowing the software and\n\n283\n00:16:40.385 --> 00:16:43.985\nstart picking at hardware and\nthen getting these little gadgets.\n\n284\n00:16:43.985 --> 00:16:45.885\nYou're gonna start hacking Wi-Fi,\nBluetooth.\n\n285\n00:16:45.885 --> 00:16:50.410\nYou'll do NFC, that's gonna be coming\nmore and more, and more You know, so\n\n286\n00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:54.360\nyou'll keep acquiring more and\nmore of these tools.\n\n287\n00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.280\nAnd you'll just keep them\nas part of your toolkit.\n\n288\n00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.910\nAnother one to go to, Hak5,\nHak5 has a lot of these.\n\n289\n00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:05.030\nWe've shown their site\non here before Hak5.org.\n\n290\n00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.890\nThey have plenty of tools\nthat they sell as well\n\n291\n00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:11.690\nthat you can get into if\nyou really truly want to.\n\n292\n00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.350\nSo you can really stock\nyour kit up pretty well.\n\n293\n00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:18.770\nThe trick is gonna be for\nthis is finding out.\n\n294\n00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:22.480\nI should say finding out,\nI guess it could be finding out,\n\n295\n00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.694\nI guess you could use that phrase.\n\n296\n00:17:24.694 --> 00:17:25.836\nYou could use that phrase, you could say,\n\n297\n00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:27.215\nI'm finding out how much\nyour checkbook can take.\n\n298\n00:17:27.215 --> 00:17:30.770\n[LAUGH] Cuz you gotta,\nyou better establish a budget.\n\n299\n00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:35.090\nYou can stock up on gadgets and\ndifferent things really quickly.\n\n300\n00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:40.130\nPeople ask me all the time, how much do I\n\n301\n00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:45.190\nspend on my penetration testing\ntool kit that I carry with me.\n\n302\n00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:49.340\nYou're not talking my actual computer and\nstuff like that.\n\n303\n00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:55.240\nWe're talking the additional tools\nthat I mentioned, plus other ones.\n\n304\n00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.590\nI spend a good amount on it.\n\n305\n00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:00.760\nLet's just put it that way.\n\n306\n00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.840\nIt's in the thousands.\n\n307\n00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.480\nBut that's because I acquire\nall different sorts of stuff,\n\n308\n00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.140\nespecially for the position I'm in.\n\n309\n00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.660\nDoing not just consulting work.\n\n310\n00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.390\nBut I also teach this stuff.\n\n311\n00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:16.280\nI do stuff like this you know,\nso I got it especially for that,\n\n312\n00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.640\nto show the range of tools to you.\n\n313\n00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.600\nSo that might change for you,\nif you're doing specific\n\n314\n00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.300\ntypes of penetration testing,\nyou may not need the full range of stuff.\n\n315\n00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:30.870\nBut you really gotta look at\nthe things you want to get.\n\n316\n00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.580\nI would also tell you,\nit's kind of part of that mix.\n\n317\n00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.830\nIt's a good educational thing for\n\n318\n00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:40.740\nyou as well., If you see something\nout there that is shrink wrapped and\n\n319\n00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:46.150\nmade, ready made for\nyou to just pick up and start using.\n\n320\n00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.030\nI mean, that's great that you\nhave something that you can\n\n321\n00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:51.220\njust grab off the shelf and use.\n\n322\n00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.050\nBut the thing is that you're gonna pay for\nthat.\n\n323\n00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.430\nYou're gonna pay for that.\n\n324\n00:18:55.430 --> 00:19:01.610\nSome places actually do offer tools\nthat they not only ready-make,\n\n325\n00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:06.390\nbut they also turn around and they will\ngive you the option to do it for nothing.\n\n326\n00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.300\nYou have to bring your own hardware,\n\n327\n00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:12.360\nbut they'll make the rest of\nthe stuff available for nothing.\n\n328\n00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.000\nI've got a site up here,\nthese guys are a good example.\n\n329\n00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.780\nThis is Pwnie Express.\n\n330\n00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:22.330\nPwnie Express has the Pwn Phone,\nthe Pwn Pad.\n\n331\n00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:25.090\nThey've got all those ones\nplus a couple other things.\n\n332\n00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:30.920\nI happen to have a Pwn Pad but\nI also got a Pwn Phone but\n\n333\n00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.680\nmine, I made my own.\n\n334\n00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.410\nI did not go out and buy theirs.\n\n335\n00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:43.660\nSo they got a $1,300 device on there\nto buy, and so I bet $1,300 device.\n\n336\n00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:48.080\nI paid a little over 200 bucks for\nthis Nexus 5.\n\n337\n00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:52.900\nI just grab their community\naddition of the software\n\n338\n00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:57.660\nwhich is actually basically\nan OS that loads on this thing.\n\n339\n00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.140\nI wipe the device, loaded that on.\n\n340\n00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:00.800\nAnd I had it.\n\n341\n00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.720\nAll I had to do is buy the adapters for\nit and I was rocking and rolling,\n\n342\n00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.590\nas you can see the adapters\nin that picture.\n\n343\n00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:07.980\nOne of them is that Bluetooth adapter.\n\n344\n00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.060\nThe other one is a wireless\nadapter to do the monitor mode.\n\n345\n00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.760\nAnd so I just had that.\n\n346\n00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.346\nGot the OTG cable,\nwhich plugs into the Micro USB port, and\n\n347\n00:20:16.346 --> 00:20:19.732\nI can plug the other stuff into it and\njust rock and roll.\n\n348\n00:20:19.732 --> 00:20:24.350\nYou're ready to go, yeah so that was\na lot cheaper than buying it this way and\n\n349\n00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.690\nit's a lot more customizable.\n\n350\n00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:30.670\nI do have\nthe Pwn Phone Community Edition on here,\n\n351\n00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:35.480\nand why I've got the Community Edition\non here, it's not all that's on here.\n\n352\n00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.100\nGuys around here have seen me talking\nabout this like it's my new kid or\n\n353\n00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.090\nsomething over the past couple weeks.\n\n354\n00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:44.860\nThey're like yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever,\nyeah, that's nice, get out of our face.\n\n355\n00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.055\nThat's why I'm going home tomorrow.\n\n356\n00:20:46.055 --> 00:20:52.340\n[LAUGH] So these, it was easy to do.\n\n357\n00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.240\nIt's an educational experience.\n\n358\n00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.750\nSomething that will prove invaluable\nto you from a hacking standpoint too,\n\n359\n00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.950\nfrom an ethical hacking standpoint.\n\n360\n00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:03.890\nIs that you're gonna\nencounter these devices.\n\n361\n00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:07.191\nKnowing how to poke and prod at them,\nload your own OS on them, and\n\n362\n00:21:07.191 --> 00:21:11.298\nthen have something that's useable that\nyou've also built from the ground up.\n\n363\n00:21:11.298 --> 00:21:16.061\nNot only do you have a sense of pride, and\nall that going, hey look what I did, but\n\n364\n00:21:16.061 --> 00:21:20.545\nyou also got a very powerful piece of\nhardware with all the software on it that\n\n365\n00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:23.920\nyou built for a lower cost,\nmuch lower cost.\n\n366\n00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.500\nAnd it could be more powerful,\nbuilt to your exact specifications.\n\n367\n00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.170\nSo do remember that.\n\n368\n00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.020\nIt's a valuable learning experience and\n\n369\n00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.830\nalso gives you something\nthat you can definitely use.\n\n370\n00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:39.680\nAnd so I found it just a great thing for\nme to be able to do.\n\n371\n00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.750\nI had already kinda done some\nof the stuff before, but\n\n372\n00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:46.150\nthis was the first time I planned\nthe whole out, specced it out and\n\n373\n00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:50.570\njust really said okay I've seen what can\nbe done and I've experimented with it.\n\n374\n00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:54.210\nNow let me get down to business and\nreally do what I want this thing to do.\n\n375\n00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:59.020\nAnd so I got something, but\nI got something that's actually real for,\n\n376\n00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.390\nI like to say,\nmy first generation one right now.\n\n377\n00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:05.000\nCuz I've already got\nplans to do my next one.\n\n378\n00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.770\nIn fact my next piece of hardware\ndo that on sitting at home now.\n\n379\n00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:14.170\nSo by like Monday I'll have my\nnext generation one online.\n\n380\n00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.300\nThat's when Skynet comes online.\n\n381\n00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.520\nSo if stuff starts going offline,\nthen you know what happened.\n\n382\n00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.150\nBut the thing to also mention about this\nis that, not to talk about just building\n\n383\n00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:27.820\na phone like this, any gadget you\nwant if this is the way you roll.\n\n384\n00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:32.450\nI'm going to tell you if you want to\npay the $1,300 to the Pwny Express,\n\n385\n00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.550\nI'm sure they're happy for you to do that.\n\n386\n00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:38.810\nI mean they're good people and\nthey make a good product and all that.\n\n387\n00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.845\nI've seen their stuff and own their pads,\n\n388\n00:22:42.845 --> 00:22:47.376\ngreat I can't complain about it but\nokay, I'm single no kids.\n\n389\n00:22:47.376 --> 00:22:51.728\nI've got some extra money, so I don't got\nto worry about those extra expenses of\n\n390\n00:22:51.728 --> 00:22:54.042\nwalking a kid and everything all the time.\n\n391\n00:22:54.042 --> 00:22:55.992\nI think that's what you do, I'm not sure.\n\n392\n00:22:55.992 --> 00:22:59.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But hey that's why I don't have any.\n\n393\n00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:05.196\nSo I know I don't have expenses,\nbut I still like to look at even\n\n394\n00:23:05.196 --> 00:23:10.439\nwhen I do make some of these big\npurchases on things like that.\n\n395\n00:23:10.439 --> 00:23:15.130\nBut the thing is I also like to,\nwhen I see a gadget that I want.\n\n396\n00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.000\nOne of the things I like to do now is\ninstead of just being tempted to say,\n\n397\n00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.970\nokay pull out the credit card or\nwhatever and buy it.\n\n398\n00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.400\nWhat I will do is see, okay what is that\nthing doing, get a good handle on it.\n\n399\n00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.800\nI'll see if I can make that myself.\n\n400\n00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.470\nYou know, because there's so\nmany things to be gained from that.\n\n401\n00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:33.480\nNot only do you save money on it, but\n\n402\n00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:38.480\nyou also gain a big learning experience\nfrom it and you gain the equipment, too.\n\n403\n00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:42.170\nAnd it gives you a much better understand\nthan if someone said, hey, here it is,\n\n404\n00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.440\npull it out of the box,\nand do whatever with it.\n\n405\n00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.959\nSo, don't forget that not only can you\nsave money by doing that in the long run,\n\n406\n00:23:48.959 --> 00:23:53.611\nyou can save even more money and you can\ngain all that knowledge that's gonna prove\n\n407\n00:23:53.611 --> 00:23:56.050\nvery, very useful to you out in the field.\n\n408\n00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.243\nSo don't ever skip that opportunity\nto build your pen testing lab,\n\n409\n00:23:59.243 --> 00:24:01.380\nis when you're building all these gadgets.\n\n410\n00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:06.265\nAnd you can do that and Something\nthat's also really cool about the whole\n\n411\n00:24:06.265 --> 00:24:09.120\nthing is when you build your own gadgets.\n\n412\n00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.240\nTrust me, I didn't make the hardware for\nthis thing,\n\n413\n00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.160\nbut I did do the custom load and\neverything on this.\n\n414\n00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.960\nWhen I told a couple people I did this,\nwow, you did that yourself?\n\n415\n00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.480\nYeah.\n\n416\n00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.140\nIt does give you some\nstreet credibility too.\n\n417\n00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:25.230\nAs far as clients go, it's not something\nI've been showing what I did with it.\n\n418\n00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:26.820\nI'm looking for input and stuff like that.\n\n419\n00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:31.550\nThat's why I'm kind of going when I go to\nmy next one, but when people see this one,\n\n420\n00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:35.610\nthey're like wow, you did that and\nso it's kind of one of those things,\n\n421\n00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:38.610\nkind of a thrill when people look\nat you like wow, that's cool.\n\n422\n00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.110\nAnd it also encourages them to do it.\n\n423\n00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:45.060\nPeople I know that seen this one, I've got\nseveral people I know that are actually\n\n424\n00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.930\nout there going okay, yeah,\nI wasn't aware you could do that.\n\n425\n00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:50.580\nI'm like yeah, I have nothing, it's\nnot like I'm some genius or something.\n\n426\n00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.780\nI looked it up, did my research,\nfigured out how to do it.\n\n427\n00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.850\nSo you can do it too and\nI know my knowledge base expanded\n\n428\n00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:01.000\ntremendously just by doing something like\nthat and so now I have something that's\n\n429\n00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.400\nextremely powerful for me to use too, so\ndon't ever pass up those opportunities.\n\n430\n00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:10.680\nIf you do want it, if you wanna do it\nthe other way and buy it, then go for it.\n\n431\n00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:13.780\n>> If you have the money.\n\n432\n00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:18.830\n>> Yeah, I'd rather sit there and\n\n433\n00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.630\nput the money towards those\nthings that I know I really,\n\n434\n00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:25.090\nreally need in the pen testing stuff\n>> And\n\n435\n00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:29.370\nthis one just happens to be something that\nserves that purpose of saving me that,\n\n436\n00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:33.375\nsince all the resources you need to do\nsomething like this or build any gadget,\n\n437\n00:25:33.375 --> 00:25:37.610\nit's out there, you may have to kinda pull\nit from many sources and put it together,\n\n438\n00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:38.740\n>> But that's just,\n\n439\n00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:43.520\nthat helps expand your brain when you're\ndoing, for pen testing and other stuff.\n\n440\n00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.420\nI mean think about it.\n\n441\n00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.780\nWhen I built this,\nI didn't just go to one page to do it.\n\n442\n00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.030\nThere were several resources I went to,\n\n443\n00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:55.230\nI can't tell you how many web pages\nI went through to get this, this way.\n\n444\n00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:58.990\nI had to look at Android development and\na whole bunch of other things.\n\n445\n00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:00.660\nSo all that stuff I had to pull together.\n\n446\n00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:02.330\nWhat do you have to do in pen testing?\n\n447\n00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:05.730\nPen testing, you have to get all\nthis information and make a coherent\n\n448\n00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:10.955\npicture out of it that you can now start\nfiguring out what your plan of action is.\n\n449\n00:26:10.955 --> 00:26:14.195\nSo these skills expand your,\nby doing something like this,\n\n450\n00:26:14.195 --> 00:26:16.145\nexpand your brain in so\nmany different ways.\n\n451\n00:26:16.145 --> 00:26:19.980\nYou have to be adaptable, you have to\nthink outside the box, as they say.\n\n452\n00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.930\nYou gotta be able to do all this stuff and\ncoordinate all this stuff,\n\n453\n00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:26.320\nand be willing to really not be afraid to\nget in there and beat on that thing and\n\n454\n00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.030\nbreak it and see what goes on.\n\n455\n00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:33.910\nAnd, heck you'll come out better for\nit and so, all those things will help you.\n\n456\n00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.655\nIn the lab it's not just\ndeveloping the skills,\n\n457\n00:26:36.655 --> 00:26:39.540\nit's developing all those thought\nprocesses all up in here.\n\n458\n00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:43.720\nSo that's what we're trying to encourage\nis, here's how you build a lab, here's\n\n459\n00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.560\nthe software, here's the hardware, here's\nsome different ways you can set it up.\n\n460\n00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:50.560\nAnd hey, if you want to do this extra\nstuff that, people who typically\n\n461\n00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.690\nthink about hacker, they think about\nhacker, oh, we got, plug the network in,\n\n462\n00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:56.350\nor check the wireless and\nwe start typing our notebook or something.\n\n463\n00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.320\nHey, there's other gadgets to have fun and\n\n464\n00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.510\ngames with, so\ntake it as a learning opportunity.\n\n465\n00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:04.040\n>> Alright,\ngreat information from Sean Oriyano.\n\n466\n00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.910\nHope everybody out there enjoyed this one.\n\n467\n00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:09.135\nCheck back for more how to's coming soon.\n\n468\n00:27:09.135 -->

00:00:13.441\nwe're gonna take a closer\nlook at reconnaissance.\n\n4\n00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:15.050\nSomething that we've talked about.\n\n5\n00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.910\nIn several of our other courses.\n\n6\n00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.620\nAnd I just want to take a more in depth\nlook at some of the information that we\n\n7\n00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.180\ncan get back, and some of the tools we\ncan use to do some good reconnaissance.\n\n8\n00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.990\nSo, Sean, show up what you've got.\n\n9\n00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.230\n>> Well, we've got some different\ntools here that we can do some\n\n10\n00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.520\nreconnaissance with.\n\n11\n00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.380\nYou know, the thing is that,\nreconnaissance as we talked about\n\n12\n00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.960\nin the ethical hacking course is something\nthat you are gonna spend some good time on\n\n13\n00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.290\nbecause there's a lot good information\nthere that can be extracted.\n\n14\n00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.750\nThe question is just where you're gonna\nactually draw that line in the sand and\n\n15\n00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.270\nsay okay, I can't keep doing this.\n\n16\n00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.490\nI keep having fun, forever, doing this.\n\n17\n00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.660\nI think some of us, you know,\nwhen we did the ethical hacking,\n\n18\n00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.340\nI remember we brought out\nthe echosec tool, and\n\n19\n00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.690\nlike I said before, we could have\njust tuned out at that point.\n\n20\n00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.670\nWe could have gone and got lunch and\npeople would still going look at this.\n\n21\n00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.270\nYou can actually get information overload\nfrom the reconnaissance process,\n\n22\n00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.290\nyou get this feeling that\nyou can see everything, and\n\n23\n00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.200\nyou got like this godlike\nview of everything.\n\n24\n00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.450\nBut the stuff we showed you was still,\nbelieve it or\n\n25\n00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.290\nnot, just that very little tip\nof the iceberg, so to speak.\n\n26\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.020\nThere's still a whole bunch of other stuff\nthat we didn't even get to in the ethical\n\n27\n00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.370\nhacking course cuz there just wasn't\ntime or it wasn't really ready for\n\n28\n00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.820\nus to go into at that point,\nwe need to do a lot more work.\n\n29\n00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.750\nSo what we're going to do is we're going\nto take a look at some of these tools.\n\n30\n00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.030\nReally I'll kind of limit to a small\nnumber of them cuz we just don't have\n\n31\n00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.365\ntime to go through all of them.\n\n32\n00:01:44.365 --> 00:01:45.140\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n33\n00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.880\n>> But what we're gonna do here is we're\ngonna take a look at the first one.\n\n34\n00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.840\nAnd the first one I've got to\nshow you is one called URL Crazy.\n\n35\n00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.930\nI like the name of that.\n\n36\n00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.135\nIf you say it the right way it's like,\nyou're all crazy.\n\n37\n00:01:58.135 --> 00:02:05.970\n[LAUGH] But what this tool does is you\ncan just, you type in the word URL crazy.\n\n38\n00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.050\nAnd so we just go ahead and type it in.\n\n39\n00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.920\nAnd what it's gonna ask you for,\nit's gonna ask you for a domain.\n\n40\n00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.800\nSo what I can do is, and\n\n41\n00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.730\nthis'll show you how this really gets\ndown to it, is I'm gonna let this run.\n\n42\n00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.350\nAnd we'll talk about it while it's\nactually running what it's actually doing\n\n43\n00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.470\nhere for us.\n\n44\n00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.990\nAnd so you can see I typed in urlcrazy and\nI typed in google.com.\n\n45\n00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.100\nOkay, so\nwhat's it doing with google.com that's so\n\n46\n00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.290\ninteresting to me, at least and\nI'm gonna go take a look at it.\n\n47\n00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.070\nWell what it's doing is you'll see it\nactually didn't take too long here to do,\n\n48\n00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.920\nit might actually take\nlonger with some URLs.\n\n49\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.220\nIt depends.\n\n50\n00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.658\nWhat we're seeing here\nis it went through and\n\n51\n00:02:48.658 --> 00:02:54.090\ngo all the way back up to where at\nthe top I typed the command the command.\n\n52\n00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.320\nwww.google.com and you can see it\ntook 132 host names to process.\n\n53\n00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.410\nIt found that immediately well if you look\ndown below you can see as you go through\n\n54\n00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.580\nall the different variations of\nthe domain name it found, okay?\n\n55\n00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.120\nSo these are,\n\n56\n00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.050\nin this case, these are different\nentry points into the Google servicer.\n\n57\n00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.980\nDifferent languages a lot,\njust about all of them point to\n\n58\n00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.690\nstuff in different languages cuz you\ncan see In the last column you can see\n\n59\n00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.460\nthe different regions they actually\nhappen to be in and where they're hosted.\n\n60\n00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.050\nBut take a look at some of this stuff.\n\n61\n00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.440\nIf you were interested in doing one of\nthe things that we've talked about,\n\n62\n00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.480\nwhich was URL hijacking or domain\nhijacking as they sometimes call it.\n\n63\n00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.310\nOr people were doing squatting or\n\n64\n00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.970\nmight be doing stuff to\nmisdirect traffic away from you.\n\n65\n00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.812\nYou notice in there if you look at\nit they've got, they've found a URL,\n\n66\n00:03:39.812 --> 00:03:45.920\ngogle.com, googe.com, googl without the e,\n\n67\n00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.850\nthey've got oogle.com,\nthat's got something assigned to it, but\n\n68\n00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.690\nthen there's other variations\nthat go right on down\n\n69\n00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.250\nthe list agog.com,\nwhatever that's supposed to be.\n\n70\n00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.760\nBut the thing is, is that I'm picking\njust a lot of variations of that name.\n\n71\n00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.920\nSome of them might people trying\nto the two misdirect traffic\n\n72\n00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.950\nby counting the fact that someone might\nmistype it and might mistype something.\n\n73\n00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.110\nThe other ones are ones that\nare owned by Google themselves.\n\n74\n00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.120\nGoogle's got, they've got stuff for,\nyou can see there's .ru domains and\n\n75\n00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.600\nstuff like that in there, I think\nthose were down closer to the bottom\n\n76\n00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.152\nWe see it in there, we see things like,\nwell there's .ca, .jp,\n\n77\n00:04:33.152 --> 00:04:38.330\n.fr, You can see just a bunch\nof other languages in there.\n\n78\n00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.940\nAnd notice you've also go\nthe IP addresses in there, too.\n\n79\n00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.980\nSo, this would be handy for you.\n\n80\n00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.880\nNotice what we did, if you saw our stuff\non NMAP that we did, the two parts that\n\n81\n00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.080\nwe did on Azure skills, remember that we\nhad something in there for IPGeo location.\n\n82\n00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.478\nSo now you've got something you could\ndump into one of those tools to see\n\n83\n00:04:59.478 --> 00:05:04.388\nwhere that particular server might be or\nit's reporting it is, so that's just\n\n84\n00:05:04.388 --> 00:05:08.810\nsome stuff you could do with it we\ntry different variations of the name.\n\n85\n00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.910\nIt's kind of interesting when\nyou do something like this,\n\n86\n00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.732\nbecause you type in some different names\ninto here, if I like type microsoft.com,\n\n87\n00:05:18.732 --> 00:05:23.170\nsome of the bigger stuff,\nI mean, there's 175 hostnames.\n\n88\n00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.662\nWhat you do when you see some of this\nstuff, you'll see that some of the things\n\n89\n00:05:26.662 --> 00:05:30.426\nthat people have done to try to misdirect\ntraffic, cause what they're trying to do\n\n90\n00:05:30.426 --> 00:05:34.070\nis they're trying to get something that,\nthey can't get Microsoft's name.\n\n91\n00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.630\nSo what do they do?\n\n92\n00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.925\nThey know that Microsoft's\ngetting a lot of traffic.\n\n93\n00:05:36.925 --> 00:05:39.985\nSo it gets something that's close or\nsomething that someone\n\n94\n00:05:39.985 --> 00:05:43.615\nmay have butter fingers or\nwhatever and type the wrong thing in.\n\n95\n00:05:43.615 --> 00:05:47.415\nAnd all of a sudden they're just going\nthrough and redirecting traffic.\n\n96\n00:05:47.415 --> 00:05:51.195\nI mean for Google,\nyou saw goggle in there.\n\n97\n00:05:51.195 --> 00:05:52.940\nYeah, people are gonna type that in.\n\n98\n00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.725\n[LAUGH]\n>> So these are not domains\n\n99\n00:05:55.725 --> 00:06:00.460\nthat Microsoft own already that they're\n>> Is that right or\n\n100\n00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.620\nthese are-\n>> Both.\n\n101\n00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.390\n>> Both?\n>> Both.\n\n102\n00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.880\nWhat it's doing is it's trying almost\n\n103\n00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.270\nlike a brute force type attack where it's\nswapping different things in and out.\n\n104\n00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.740\nAnd you'll see some of them actually are,\nyou know,\n\n105\n00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.760\nMicrosoft stuff just in different,\nin different regions.\n\n106\n00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.530\nYou'll see, you know, there's dot US,\ndot FR, so those just happen to be,\n\n107\n00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.510\nit's a site owned by Microsoft, it's just\nis there French portal for their stuff.\n\n108\n00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.610\nBut then you go through\nsome of these other ones,\n\n109\n00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.090\nthese clearly aren't owned by Microsoft,\nMYC,\n\n110\n00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.160\nyou know we've got MYC soft,\nthey've got that, who knows,\n\n111\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.460\nsomeone might mistype that and\nit's in the British Virgin Islands.\n\n112\n00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.742\nYou know,\nI don't think Microsoft is gonna,\n\n113\n00:06:50.742 --> 00:06:54.380\nI don't think their name gets localized\nlike that let's put it that way.\n\n114\n00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.220\nSo, that's something that\nsomeone else has owned.\n\n115\n00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.620\nSo now you're saying,\noh hey, look at that.\n\n116\n00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.610\nGot someone that's trying to do domain\nsquatting or trying to hijack something or\n\n117\n00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.260\ntrying to grab our traffic\nby counting on that.\n\n118\n00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.800\nWe could maybe go after them.\n\n119\n00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.100\n>> Yeah, that's what was my next question,\nwhat do we do with this information.\n\n120\n00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.080\nWe see a bunch of variations\nof microsoft.com, but\n\n121\n00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.810\nwhat do we do with this?\n\n122\n00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.715\n>> That's the thing, is that you've got\n>> There's different avenues that\n\n123\n00:07:22.715 --> 00:07:24.155\nopen up here.\n\n124\n00:07:24.155 --> 00:07:28.165\nFrom a pen testing perspective, what\nI'd do is I'd go through this list and\n\n125\n00:07:28.165 --> 00:07:33.035\nI can see at least from my eyes and\nlooking at that I can see that,\n\n126\n00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:36.460\nokay these ones that are from\ndifferent countries, like .it, .es.\n\n127\n00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.160\nI mean, those make sense to me.\n\n128\n00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.170\nThose are owned over Microsoft cuz\nthose are different country codes.\n\n129\n00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.430\nBut some of those other ones\nthat are clearly misspelled and\n\n130\n00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.240\nit's not something Microsoft would do,\nby someone else.\n\n131\n00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.175\nSo from a strictly penetration testing\nperspective, I probably don't care about\n\n132\n00:07:52.175 --> 00:07:55.163\nthose ones that are misspelled\nbecause that's someone else.\n\n133\n00:07:55.163 --> 00:08:00.039\nI might give that, if I was penetration\ntesting for Microsoft, I might give them\n\n134\n00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:04.628\nto them, go, by the way There are some\npeople that are masquerading as you or\n\n135\n00:08:04.628 --> 00:08:08.612\ninfringing your trademark and\njust thought you'd like to know.\n\n136\n00:08:08.612 --> 00:08:10.400\nAnd then they can choose what to do,\nfrom there.\n\n137\n00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.650\nFrom a penetration perspective,\nI see some different sub domains or\n\n138\n00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.400\ndifferent domains of a regions or\nmight be something where I can punch in.\n\n139\n00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.690\nI might do a further investigation and\nsome reason find,\n\n140\n00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:27.630\noh that website in that country\ndoesn't have the same IT presence or\n\n141\n00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:31.680\nwhatever backing it up, so\nthat might be my entry point to get in.\n\n142\n00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.450\nMicrosoft, for example, you might\ndecide well, there's stuff up here in\n\n143\n00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.690\nRedmond is pretty much where,\nsince it's part of the mothership,\n\n144\n00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:44.740\nas they joke around, it's something\nthat it's gonna more defended\n\n145\n00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:50.200\nthan we'd have one sitting over in\nTaiwan or some place like that.\n\n146\n00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.650\nSo, that might serve as your entry point.\n\n147\n00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.650\nBut what's the website for one in there?\n\n148\n00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:55.640\nYou can try some stuff.\n\n149\n00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.950\nYou go through Microsoft's website and\n\n150\n00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.740\nclick to see if they've got\none specifically for Taiwan.\n\n151\n00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.150\nThat would take some time,\nbut it's doable.\n\n152\n00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.405\nThis will say, okay,\nlet's give you everything, so\n\n153\n00:09:04.405 --> 00:09:07.200\nyou can see of where all\nthe doors are into this place.\n\n154\n00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.890\nSo the other stuff,\nthat depends on what your mandate is.\n\n155\n00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:17.300\nIf you see them and they're not actually\nMicrosoft, but someone else, and you're\n\n156\n00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.680\njust tasked with going after Microsoft,\nthen that's all you're gonna do.\n\n157\n00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.700\nYou're not gonna worry about those\nones because they're not gonna get you\n\n158\n00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.660\nto that goal.\n\n159\n00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.650\nBut if you're worried about helping them\nwith the legal side of things, or you just\n\n160\n00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.480\nwanna be a good citizen with them, and\nsay hey, look what I found on here.\n\n161\n00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.374\nI don't know if you're concerned about it\nor not, if it's something you're looking\n\n162\n00:09:36.374 --> 00:09:39.008\ninto, but I found these too and\nso it's just I provide it.\n\n163\n00:09:39.008 --> 00:09:44.788\nSo, that's what you could use this for if\nyou want from a pen testing perspective,\n\n164\n00:09:44.788 --> 00:09:47.856\nprobably not gonna be\nof a high value to you.\n\n165\n00:09:47.856 --> 00:09:49.344\n>> Got you.\n\n166\n00:09:49.344 --> 00:09:51.870\n>> But that's one thing we can do.\n\n167\n00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:56.140\nWe did see that we could\ndo that type of function\n\n168\n00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.810\nusing some of our other tools in Windows,\nso there were some ones.\n\n169\n00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.740\nWe also noticed we went into Netcraft,\nNetcraft will do that for\n\n170\n00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.450\nyou if you leave out the www in front,\nit'll start finding subdomains,\n\n171\n00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:10.870\nbut notice where this one\nexcels where Netcraft can't.\n\n172\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:17.020\nNetcraft, what it did is if you left out\nthe www and just put in something.com,\n\n173\n00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:22.290\nor dot whatever it was, it would find that\nplus all the subdomains underneath it.\n\n174\n00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:28.635\nThat, plus the subdomains underneath it,\nit's just the stuff that's in that tree,\n\n175\n00:10:28.635 --> 00:10:29.875\nin that family.\n\n176\n00:10:29.875 --> 00:10:31.425\nThis is clearly not doing that.\n\n177\n00:10:31.425 --> 00:10:37.065\nThis is clearly finding that plus other\nstuff that even sounds similar to it.\n\n178\n00:10:37.065 --> 00:10:39.080\nSo it's not the same domain at all.\n\n179\n00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.330\nBut it looks and sounds and acts like it,\n\n180\n00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.080\nso we're close enough that we're\ngonna include it as part of this.\n\n181\n00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.070\nAnd so you've got additional\nthings that are gonna show up.\n\n182\n00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.840\nI also like the fact that even if you\ndon't care about those other ones and\n\n183\n00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:58.270\nyou can customize what this does,\nif you type in the URL crazy command,\n\n184\n00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:01.050\nyou can see that it's got some options.\n\n185\n00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:05.180\nIt's not a bunch of options,\nbut its got enough.\n\n186\n00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.370\nYou can play with these options.\n\n187\n00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.670\nYou can get different results and\nhaving noticed in here by the way,\n\n188\n00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.530\nthe option in there,\nit's got a keyboard layout, so\n\n189\n00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:16.390\nif you got a different country and\nsomebody uses a different keyboard layout.\n\n190\n00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.610\nYou can actually account for that.\n\n191\n00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:19.140\n>> Nice.\n\n192\n00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.050\n>> So you can do quite\na few things with this, and\n\n193\n00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.950\nwhat will happen is you can just\ngo ahead and run this and choose\n\n194\n00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:30.719\nthe options you want, put it out to a file\nand you very quickly and easily got this.\n\n195\n00:11:32.048 --> 00:11:36.860\nWith Netcraft, Netcraft's a great tool and\ncan do the same thing to a point, but\n\n196\n00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.362\nit's someone else's, service.\n\n197\n00:11:40.362 --> 00:11:43.500\nIt's hosted someplace else,\nso I got to rely on them.\n\n198\n00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.250\nI got to have an Internet connection,\nall of that, which you got to have here.\n\n199\n00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.120\nBut this thing is at\nleast hosted on there.\n\n200\n00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.160\nIt might work a little bit better for me.\n\n201\n00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.609\nSo, that's what I just kinda\ntend to think this tool is for.\n\n202\n00:11:53.609 --> 00:11:56.531\nAlso wants us to do point out\none other one I had forgot.\n\n203\n00:11:56.531 --> 00:11:58.940\nNeglected to mention, phishing.\n\n204\n00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.078\nThis would be useful to\nfind phishing URLs too.\n\n205\n00:12:01.078 --> 00:12:04.010\nIf you suspect, someone's trying to\nredirect people off your site by means of\n\n206\n00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:08.470\ndoing phishing and crafting this\nstuff that looks close or whatever.\n\n207\n00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.890\nThat would be another way to get it.\n\n208\n00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.590\n>> Very good.\n>> So, pretty neat.\n\n209\n00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:16.680\nThis tool's not one that's\ntalked about a lot,\n\n210\n00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.800\nbut I think it's something\nthat should be on your radar,\n\n211\n00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:25.330\nbecause it's just one more thing to\nkeep in the toolbox to do stuff with.\n\n212\n00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.610\nSo there's that.\n\n213\n00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.120\nSo, cool we've got that one.\n\n214\n00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.200\nBut then there's something\nelse I kinda want to show you,\n\n215\n00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:37.440\nkinda jump to something else, is what\nif you're doing those Nmap scans and\n\n216\n00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.640\nyou are using those scripts and say,\nlet's start finding vulnerabilities.\n\n217\n00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.100\nThat's something that comes into play.\n\n218\n00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.860\nYou're gonna find vulnerabilities,\nespecially if you use something with Nmap.\n\n219\n00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.220\nYou're trying to find okay, well you run\nNmap and you run that script and it says,\n\n220\n00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.260\nokay, I found some vulnerabilities on here\nand you're trying to find out what those\n\n221\n00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.540\nvulnerabilities are, find the numbers on\nthem so you can do further investigation.\n\n222\n00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.130\nBecause Nmap knew about it.\n\n223\n00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:05.500\nSo you wanna get a little more to\nsee if that's something that is\n\n224\n00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.370\nan attractive option for you to get your\nfoot in the door and go right on through.\n\n225\n00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.510\nWell they've got a tool for that too.\n\n226\n00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.130\nIt's something called searchsploit.\n\n227\n00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:18.560\nI'll just, you know, type in the command\nhere without anything after it.\n\n228\n00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.910\nWhat searchsploit does is all it\nis is you type in searchsploit,\n\n229\n00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.830\nand what you do is, it's basically\na command line search engine when\n\n230\n00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:32.380\nyou get down to it, you type in\nthe actual searchsploit command and then\n\n231\n00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.600\nyou type in the name of what you wanna\nlook for or keyword relating to that.\n\n232\n00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.536\nIf I typed in searchsploit in Microsoft,\na bunch of stuff scrolls by, and\n\n233\n00:13:41.536 --> 00:13:46.960\nit tells me hey, here's all the stuff\nthat I've got on file for this one.\n\n234\n00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.720\nAnd if you really got a keen eye and\npaying attention to all this,\n\n235\n00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.330\nI go through and I scroll through all\nthis, and we just go back in here.\n\n236\n00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.520\nWell, you start seeing\nthis stuff over here.\n\n237\n00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.830\nSo it's got the name of it.\n\n238\n00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:02.610\nWhat's this also doing for you?\n\n239\n00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.730\nIt's telling you the Metasploit\nstuff that works with it.\n\n240\n00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.670\nSo, you find something in there, and\nit's going, hey, look what I got.\n\n241\n00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:16.360\nI already got on file and ready to go, you\njust gotta load it up and let's do this.\n\n242\n00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.900\nSo you recognize those paths,\nbecause remember we did use and\n\n243\n00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:24.220\nwe typed stuff out to tell it\nwhat exploit to use and all that.\n\n244\n00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:24.853\nThat's what those are.\n\n245\n00:14:24.853 --> 00:14:26.600\n>> Nice.\n\n246\n00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.550\n>> So it's really pairing it up for\nyou and you can see over here,\n\n247\n00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:34.170\nin the description column,\nit's telling you specifically the types\n\n248\n00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:38.700\nof exploits that are there and even the\nknowledge based articles in certain cases.\n\n249\n00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.440\nSo you can really go to town with this and\njust gotta know a keyword or\n\n250\n00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:46.720\nget that little bit of information off of\na scan someplace in the earlier phase.\n\n251\n00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.430\nAnd this might be where you're doing\nthat scan enumeration and like,\n\n252\n00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:50.720\noh I found something that's of interest,\n\n253\n00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.096\nlet me see if there's any vulnerabilities\non that cuz I know an operating system.\n\n254\n00:14:54.096 --> 00:14:55.810\nKnow this, look at the key words in.\n\n255\n00:14:55.810 --> 00:15:01.190\nYou just type in searchsploit space,\nkeyword comma keyword comma keyword.\n\n256\n00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.230\nAnd boom, hit it and watch what happens.\n\n257\n00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:07.640\nAnd it will spit something back at\nyou saying hey, look what I found.\n\n258\n00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.420\nAnd you can decide if you want to fire\nup Metasploit and take a shot at it or\n\n259\n00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.750\nif you wanna look for something else.\n\n260\n00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.610\n>> Nice.\n>> So, pretty neat, I think.\n\n261\n00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.000\nConsidering the stuff that we've done,\n\n262\n00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.410\nnotice that we've brought\na couple things together there.\n\n263\n00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:25.110\nBecause we already, in our other shows,\nwe did, especially on ethical hacking,\n\n264\n00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:29.320\nstuff like that, we did banner grabs, and\nwe showed how to do those types of things.\n\n265\n00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.290\nNow what we're doing is we're saying okay,\nwell we've got those banner grabs,\n\n266\n00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.290\nwe've got those scans and all that done.\n\n267\n00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:38.553\nAnd we've got that information,\nand we also know Metasploit.\n\n268\n00:15:38.553 --> 00:15:45.380\nMetasploit, with that in our very powerful\ntool sitting out there for us to use.\n\n269\n00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.880\nHow do we bridge that gap between the two\nand find out, we've got stuff here,\n\n270\n00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.370\nhow do I know Metasploit's got that?\n\n271\n00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.520\nDo I just poke around and\nhope for the best?\n\n272\n00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.408\nYou could, but\nyou're gonna get bogged down pretty\n\n273\n00:15:56.408 --> 00:16:00.160\nquickly from the sheer number of\nstuff that you have in Metasploit.\n\n274\n00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.340\nHere you can go and say,\nokay, I found something.\n\n275\n00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.786\nPull the banner, look at stuff,\ndrop those NST words.\n\n276\n00:16:04.786 --> 00:16:06.290\nSee if Metasploit's got something.\n\n277\n00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:09.680\nAnd then do your investigation maybe\na little closer and say, I got something.\n\n278\n00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.940\nYou know, I got this guy on the hook, and\nso let me close in for the kill on it.\n\n279\n00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.870\nSo that would be where this would come in.\n\n280\n00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.800\nSo I thought it was a very\nuseful thing to point out.\n\n281\n00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.810\nAnd this is something that they do update,\nby the way.\n\n282\n00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:24.020\nThey update all the time\nthe database in here.\n\n283\n00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:31.704\nGets updated with new information, so you\ncan use this over and over and over again.\n\n284\n00:16:31.704 --> 00:16:36.390\nSo that's searchsploit if\nyou're playing along at home.\n\n285\n00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:39.759\nVery simple command line tool to use.\n\n286\n00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.390\nThen one more thing to cover here.\n\n287\n00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.190\nThis is probably the big one for you.\n\n288\n00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.620\nThis is one called Discover\nas it says up top.\n\n289\n00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.090\nYou can download this one.\n\n290\n00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:55.590\nThis one is something you can download and\ninstall inside of Kali.\n\n291\n00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.440\nAll I have to do is look up discoverer.sh.\n\n292\n00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.310\nYou can get that online and\nyou can just grab it.\n\n293\n00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:06.740\nActually it should be loaded in Kali,\nbut some people for\n\n294\n00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.890\nsome reason don't have it but whatever.\n\n295\n00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.890\nMaybe they uninstalled it or\ndid something.\n\n296\n00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:14.310\nBut in any case, you can get it\nif you don't have it in there.\n\n297\n00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:18.755\nWhat Discover does, you just run it,\nyou just start the command by doing\n\n298\n00:17:18.755 --> 00:17:23.240\n./discover.sh and\nit will fire up the command.\n\n299\n00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.560\nAnd what happens here is that when\nyou fire up the command it brings up\n\n300\n00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.690\nthis menu.\n\n301\n00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.580\nAnd what that menu is doing is, actually,\n\n302\n00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.610\nthis is what I really like\nabout this discover tool is.\n\n303\n00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:38.870\nIt looks very simple and\nvery inviting to you,\n\n304\n00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:42.830\nit's not really, it doesn't look\nlike it presents you all that much.\n\n305\n00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.920\nBut it's actually so\n\n306\n00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:49.080\nmany things going on here that you\nwouldn't believe with this tool.\n\n307\n00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.220\nWhat this tool does, discover\nactually is a script that loads, and\n\n308\n00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.910\nyou can choose stuff off the menu here.\n\n309\n00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:58.570\nAnd when you choose stuff off the menu,\nand there's sub-menus underneath this.\n\n310\n00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.520\nThat will give you additional options.\n\n311\n00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.320\nWhat is gonna happen is,\n\n312\n00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.620\nwhen you choose something, it will feed\nthat information through to another tool.\n\n313\n00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:10.530\nAnd what those tools are things like\nNikto, that they have on here, and\n\n314\n00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.660\nNAP behind the scenes here,\nand a couple of other ones.\n\n315\n00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:17.520\nIt's feeding the stuff between those guys\nto get you the information that you need.\n\n316\n00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.540\nIt's even doing stuff like Google Hacks\nand stuff like that for you.\n\n317\n00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:24.220\nSo, something that just looks light,\n\n318\n00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.180\nthat's just a simple looking interface and\nnot that much is going on.\n\n319\n00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:32.190\nTremendous amount of stuff behind\nthe scenes here, so really, really cool.\n\n320\n00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:36.430\nIf we go to the stuff like the scanning\nsection, I hit 4 and enter.\n\n321\n00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:38.080\nIt's gonna say okay what\ndo you want to scan?\n\n322\n00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.550\nWhat do you want to do?\n\n323\n00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:42.170\nI could say look for net bio stuff.\n\n324\n00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.040\nIt'll ask me how do you\nwant to put that in?\n\n325\n00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.300\nI can say I want to put an address in,\nwhat address I can put in,\n\n326\n00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:54.270\nlike mine here on my virtual system.\n\n327\n00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.250\nI could do this deal.\n\n328\n00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.620\nI did the slash the right way.\n\n329\n00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.750\nI always go to put\nthe slash the wrong way.\n\n330\n00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:04.250\nIt's my switching back and\nforth between Windows and Lennox.\n\n331\n00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:06.690\nI put it like this and go like that.\n\n332\n00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:13.880\nBut anyway, you just go through and\nit'll run the scan right there for you.\n\n333\n00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.920\nPretty neat.\n\n334\n00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.620\nThis is what you wanna do,\nthis is what I found.\n\n335\n00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:22.360\nSo that's, you gotta like the fact that\nit will do something like that, and\n\n336\n00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.940\nlet me just run that command\nagain to go back in.\n\n337\n00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.330\nI mean, other things you tell it\nto look for, domain information,\n\n338\n00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:33.330\nit can actually really\naggressively target a domain.\n\n339\n00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:34.330\nSo you could say okay,\n\n340\n00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:38.590\nthere's a, if I say a domain if I\nwanna gather some information from it.\n\n341\n00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:44.100\nI could say, and I'll put my good\nold friend USA Today in here again.\n\n342\n00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.740\nAnd it will go and\n\n343\n00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:50.510\njust do a sweep of that site to see\nif it can gather some information.\n\n344\n00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.240\nNow this isn't actually hacking anything,\nso\n\n345\n00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.970\nif you think I'm just targeting their\nsite and just going, eh, whatever.\n\n346\n00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:59.980\nAll it's doing is just doing a quick\nscrape to see if it could find anything of\n\n347\n00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:04.280\ninterest to us, in this case email,\nyou can see it's scanning for it.\n\n348\n00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.700\nSo it'll take a little time and start\nbringing that stuff back if it finds any.\n\n349\n00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:14.070\nSo it may take some time, but\nusually it will come back with something.\n\n350\n00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:21.560\nSo you could do stuff like that, you can\nsee it'll run other stuff like DNS recon.\n\n351\n00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.580\nI just kind of cancelled out of that\nto make it kind of speed up a bit.\n\n352\n00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.980\nSo let's see it's still doing that.\n\n353\n00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.213\nIt didn't like me canceling it out.\n\n354\n00:20:33.213 --> 00:20:36.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like leave me alone.\n\n355\n00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:45.400\nSo let me close that and\nreopen since I gave it fits there.\n\n356\n00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:51.110\nThat's not the way you're supposed\nto exit out, so, but that's fine.\n\n357\n00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.530\nBut, you see in here this\nis the command to run it.\n\n358\n00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.140\nI was talking about that there.\n\n359\n00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.820\nDiscover SH.\n\n360\n00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.760\nWhat I wish, what I would have done on\nthat one in real life if that was running\n\n361\n00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:06.470\ntoo long, or I could've closed that\nwindow or canceled it like I did.\n\n362\n00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:10.510\nBut I, real life I would have known\nthat those things are running,\n\n363\n00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.950\nwhich I knew those things were running.\n\n364\n00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:13.490\nJust be prepared.\n\n365\n00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:17.590\nIt's gonna take some time for this for\nit to gather some of this information.\n\n366\n00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:21.470\nYou can see it does people searches\non here where you can give it a name.\n\n367\n00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.680\nSo it can do just so\nmany different things.\n\n368\n00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.641\nThere's our Nicto for our web scanning.\n\n369\n00:21:27.641 --> 00:21:28.171\n>> Hm.\n>> And so\n\n370\n00:21:28.171 --> 00:21:32.446\nyou can just keep feeding more and\nmore and more stuff into this, and\n\n371\n00:21:32.446 --> 00:21:35.221\nit will gather this stuff up and\nif you want,\n\n372\n00:21:35.221 --> 00:21:38.970\nit will put it out to a file\n>> What I also like about this one is that\n\n373\n00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:45.330\noption number 14 on there, it will\nactually take this stuff and gather and\n\n374\n00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:50.600\ngo okay, I'll go ahead and do and\nupdate for this or what have you on it.\n\n375\n00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.040\nSo they update this one all the time.\n\n376\n00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.090\n>> Nice.\n>> So as new tools come in and\n\n377\n00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.730\nthe guy updates the script.\n\n378\n00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.880\nThen you can add more\nfunctionality on to it.\n\n379\n00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.330\nIt's just such a neat thing to have for\npeople.\n\n380\n00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.030\nI'll just kinda show you that one.\n\n381\n00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:12.970\nIf I put in my name in here,\nit takes some time to do.\n\n382\n00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:16.270\nAnd what it does is to open up my\nbrowser seeing what it can find.\n\n383\n00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:23.170\nSo, it's looking across the web for\ninformation relating to me.\n\n384\n00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:25.040\nIt was funny.\n\n385\n00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.130\nZaba shows you something else, too,\n\n386\n00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:31.460\nbecause when I went through this\ninformation, ain't none of it right.\n\n387\n00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:31.960\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n388\n00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.670\n>> So that's why you double check\n\n389\n00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:34.710\nthis stuff.\n\n390\n00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:39.460\nSo, it's either not right or it just.\n\n391\n00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:44.160\nPlain simple, not right or\nit's been incorrect for many, many,\n\n392\n00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.030\nmany, many years.\n\n393\n00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:45.960\nIt was right at one point.\n\n394\n00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.930\nYou know so that one isn't right.\n\n395\n00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.590\nThis one says it didn't find anything.\n\n396\n00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:55.240\nThis one, some of that is mildly right.\n\n397\n00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.130\nBut if you can put it that way.\n\n398\n00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:00.680\nAnd you can even see shared databases.\n\n399\n00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.910\nThat was wrong on the other page.\n\n400\n00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:03.990\nThis one isn't right here either.\n\n401\n00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:06.350\nBut you can see that,\nyou can go through this.\n\n402\n00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:10.190\nMine, the case with mine,\nmine is not necessarily\n\n403\n00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:14.560\ngonna show up on some of these services\nbecause of what I do personally to make\n\n404\n00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:19.510\nsure stuff doesn't show up in here\nto scramble it a bit intentionally.\n\n405\n00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.886\nFor my own privacy and for fun.\n\n406\n00:23:22.886 --> 00:23:30.310\nBut for the average Joe that's a little\nless sensitive with their information,\n\n407\n00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:36.250\na little less controlling of it, you'll\nget some stuff up here that is correct.\n\n408\n00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:42.299\nSo just keep that in mind when you go and\nlook at these things.\n\n409\n00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.950\nYou know, so you know pretty neat tool to\nlike I said have in your actual tool kit.\n\n410\n00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:55.090\nAnd like so they update this all the time,\nso you can do so many things with it.\n\n411\n00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:57.590\nI like the fact down here\nthat this one has one of\n\n412\n00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:01.310\nthese reconnaissance things where, so\nit has reconnaissance capabilities.\n\n413\n00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:05.830\nIt can do the scanning for us,\nit can interrogate websites.\n\n414\n00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:09.800\nBut then look at the miscellaneous even\nhas the ability to go out if you type\n\n415\n00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.920\nit in to crack out wi-fi.\n\n416\n00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.830\nI don't have my wi-fi stuff\nplugged into this, but\n\n417\n00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:16.990\nit can actually run those tools\nto help you out and do that.\n\n418\n00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:20.460\nSo it's really kind of\nan all in one solution.\n\n419\n00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:24.500\nThe other ones we talked about\nwas Searchsploit and URL Crazy.\n\n420\n00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:28.820\nThose ones are actually targeted\ntowards specific purposes.\n\n421\n00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.850\nThis one isn't targeted towards\nany one specific purpose.\n\n422\n00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:35.100\nIt's something that can do many things for\nyou.\n\n423\n00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:39.560\nAnd the fact that, like I said, they\nupdate this stuff all the time to include\n\n424\n00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.900\nall sorts of additional things\nis a really neat thing.\n\n425\n00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.360\nFor you to have.\n\n426\n00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.020\n>> Very good.\nAll right,\n\n427\n00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.000\nwell Sean, a lot of great\ninformation on reconnaissance.\n\n428\n00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.490\nAnything else we wanna\ntalk about in this how to?\n\n429\n00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:56.970\n>> I would tell everyone that\nwe did some reconnaissance here.\n\n430\n00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:01.750\nWe showed three of the new tools\nthat you hadn't seen before.\n\n431\n00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.370\nAnd there's still plenty more to go.\n\n432\n00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:08.030\nThere are still a lot more reconnaissance\ntools inside of Kali waiting for\n\n433\n00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.440\nyou to discover and to work with.\n\n434\n00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.300\nSo go ahead and try it.\n\n435\n00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:16.040\nThere's ones that are even more surprising\nand more interesting even than these.\n\n436\n00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.320\nJust try to kinda ease you down\nthe path to show you some more of\n\n437\n00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.040\nthe stuff that's in there.\n\n438\n00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:19.720\nHopefully, you know,\n\n439\n00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:24.090\nyou'll take that leap and explore more\nof them because what it's all about.\n\n440\n00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:25.530\n>> There you go, you heard it from Shaun,\n\n441\n00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:29.341\nyou need to do some reconnaissance on\nthe reconnaissance tools in Kali Linux.\n\n442\n00:25:29.341 --> 00:25:30.716\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, well ladies and\n\n443\n00:25:30.716 --> 00:25:32.740\ngentlemen, we hope you\nenjoyed watching this how-to.\n\n444\n00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.559\nStay tuned for more coming your way.\n\n445\n00:25:34.559 --> 00:25:40.570\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:14.565\nme, and we're gonna take a look\nat a tool called Ghost Phisher.\n\n4\n00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:17.050\nSean, the name alone is pretty darn cool.\n\n5\n00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.620\nBut what the heck is Ghost Phisher?\n\n6\n00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.130\n>> That's worth the price of admission,\nright here.\n\n7\n00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.845\nAint it?\n[LAUGH] So,

some of\n\n10\n00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.140\nthe hacking slash tools for whatever, they\nlove getting crazy with their names and\n\n11\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.010\nthis is just one of those cases\n>> So\n\n12\n00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.130\nwhat we're looking at here is\na tool called Ghost Phisher, and\n\n13\n00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.801\nto kind of set the stage on what\nyou can expect with Ghost Phisher,\n\n14\n00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:53.510\nGhost Phisher fits the category\nof auditing/attack tool.\n\n15\n00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.690\nSo that's still pretty broad.\n\n16\n00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.280\nIt kind of tells you what it does, but it\ndoesn't really tell you what it does, so\n\n17\n00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.790\nwe kind of got to clear that thing up.\n\n18\n00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.170\nAnd tell you what, really get down to\nbusiness here, and say, What does it do?\n\n19\n00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.850\nSo, what it does is this.\n\n20\n00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.450\nIt does cover those two areas.\n\n21\n00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.500\nIt does allow you to do\na number of different things.\n\n22\n00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.780\nIt's one of those tools that allows you\nto run a number of different attacks and\n\n23\n00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.570\njust jump in and\ndo different things at the network level.\n\n24\n00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.590\nAnd so it's really, really neat because\nyou're not going after individual system,\n\n25\n00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.220\nyou're actually observing,\nmanipulating and\n\n26\n00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.280\ndoing stuff to traffic to at\nthe network level between hosts.\n\n27\n00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.320\nYou could do things like session hijacking\nand you can do stuff in wireless and\n\n28\n00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.380\nwired networks, I mean, some pretty\nneat stuff in here, I think, all around.\n\n29\n00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.520\nSo this is a tool that is,\nit comes with Kali, right out of the box.\n\n30\n00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.320\nIt's written in Python.\n\n31\n00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.260\nI will tell you that sometimes\nit can be a little quirky.\n\n32\n00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.930\nSome of these tools do tend to be that.\n\n33\n00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.870\nOne of the quirks it has is\nthe text on there just kind\n\n34\n00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.130\nof can be a little bit small on it.\n\n35\n00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.100\nThe person who wrote it\nconfigured it that way.\n\n36\n00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.926\nYou can go into the, I don't know maybe\nthe person had really good vision,\n\n37\n00:02:04.926 --> 00:02:06.820\nate a lot of carrots, I don't know.\n\n38\n00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.090\nThey wrote it that way, you actually\nif you wanted to you could probably\n\n39\n00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.920\ngo into one of the text files and\nmodify it to change the text size, but\n\n40\n00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.410\nwe won't get into that level of complexity\nhere and throw that on the fire.\n\n41\n00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.710\nSo let's take a look.\n\n42\n00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.160\nI've got Ghost Phisher up here on my\nscreen and we can zoom in to keep\n\n43\n00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.589\nyou guys from getting too many\nheadaches and all that looking at it.\n\n44\n00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.910\nSo there's a Ghost Phisher.\n\n45\n00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.440\nAcross the top you're gonna\nsee some tools up here.\n\n46\n00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.500\nThe last one is just our about tab.\n\n47\n00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.970\nWe have tools to do fake access points,\nfake DNS servers,\n\n48\n00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.970\nfake DHCP server, a fake HTTP.\n\n49\n00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.680\nThey've got something called ghost trap,\nwhich we'll talk about there.\n\n50\n00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.595\nI need my Ghostbuster stuff.\n\n51\n00:02:53.595 --> 00:02:56.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So then we've got session hijacking,\n\n52\n00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.240\nARP cache poisoning, and\nthen harvesting credentials.\n\n53\n00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.670\nSo, some very interesting\nstuff right there.\n\n54\n00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.410\nSo yeah,\nit's kinda it goes across the board on it.\n\n55\n00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.640\nNow as far as the wireless stuff goes, and\nsince I don't have a wireless card hooked\n\n56\n00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.840\ninto my virtual machine, I won't worry\nabout getting into that at this point.\n\n57\n00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.880\nIt will be something we do at a later time\nbecause wireless is a much bigger topic.\n\n58\n00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.860\nBut just to kinda let you know, what this\none does is yes it does set up a fake\n\n59\n00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.920\naccess point and\nyou can use it as a honey pot.\n\n60\n00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.230\nSo you could actually just route\ntraffic through this machine and\n\n61\n00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.000\nhave it set itself up as looking\nlike a legitimate access point.\n\n62\n00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.250\nPeople would attach to it and\nit would route right through it.\n\n63\n00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.890\nBut we'll talk about that another time.\n\n64\n00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.840\nI just want to point it out\nbecause it is something that\n\n65\n00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.500\nis gonna be right there staring you in\nthe face when you open this utility up.\n\n66\n00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.760\nSo what I'll do is I'll move over to\nthe fake DNS server side of the things.\n\n67\n00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.330\nSo that's the next tab over.\n\n68\n00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.260\nThat's exactly what this does.\n\n69\n00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.020\nIt can actually act as a DNS server.\n\n70\n00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.180\nWhat you can do is you can\ntell it what interface to use.\n\n71\n00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.800\nYou got multiple interfaces on the system.\n\n72\n00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.680\nYou can choose that from your drop down\nthen you can tell it the address that goes\n\n73\n00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.070\nto it, so right now it's got the port for\nDNS setup over here, port 53 UDP.\n\n74\n00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.340\nIt's doing queries.\n\n75\n00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.790\nIt's got the IP address already dropped\nin cuz I only have one IP address on this\n\n76\n00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.670\nsystem and one interface for that matter,\nso that's why it's got to pre-populate it.\n\n77\n00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.200\nAnd then what you can do here\nis you can actually, say well,\n\n78\n00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.370\nif you really want to be a kind\nof mess with people in here and\n\n79\n00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.640\nredirect them, what you can do\nis you can actually tell it,\n\n80\n00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.520\nit says resolve all queries\nto the following address.\n\n81\n00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.720\nSo it means you can have it set up where\nif any DNS query comes into the system,\n\n82\n00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.270\nit services that request,\n\n83\n00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.520\nwhat will happen is it's gonna\nredirect it right directly to this.\n\n84\n00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.660\nWhatever comes into it comes into it.\n\n85\n00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.080\nAnd then it can also say, you can make\nit respond to only specific websites.\n\n86\n00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.690\nThat's probably the more\nlikely one you'd use.\n\n87\n00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.515\nThat would be a good way, like the name\nof is this tool suggests, phishing,\n\n88\n00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:11.485\nthat could be really a good way\nto do phishing is that you could\n\n89\n00:05:11.485 --> 00:05:15.783\nuse something like a social tool kit\nwhich we saw back when we did Metasploit.\n\n90\n00:05:15.783 --> 00:05:21.780\nYou could use that to actually create\nan email that direct summon to a URL, and\n\n91\n00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.170\nthat URL, you could make a very realistic\nlooking Facebook page or something.\n\n92\n00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.733\nWhen they go there,\nthey pop in their credentials into it,\n\n93\n00:05:29.733 --> 00:05:33.870\nthey type in Facebook,\nthis intercepts the Facebook.com stuff and\n\n94\n00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.160\nredirects them to your\npseudo Facebook page.\n\n95\n00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.380\nThey do their stuff there and\nwhen you capture their credentials,\n\n96\n00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.130\nyou redirect them over to\nthe real Facebook site and\n\n97\n00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.900\nthen they're none the wiser, meanwhile,\nyou've got their credentials.\n\n98\n00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.150\nYou could do that with something like\nthis as the attack side of things or\n\n99\n00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.940\nyou could just use it and it will log\nthe stuff at the bottom telling you, hey\n\n100\n00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.260\nhere's the queries that I've resolved so\nfar and you could save that to a log file.\n\n101\n00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.960\nIf you want, so\nyou can just passively do it, or\n\n102\n00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.980\nyou can actively engage\npeople through this.\n\n103\n00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.380\nThat's one thing, you would have\nto figure out a way to change\n\n104\n00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.840\nthat, the DNS settings on their system,\nbut that's where a Trojan comes in and\n\n105\n00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.370\nsome of those other utilities, so\nwe've got that ability to do that already,\n\n106\n00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.840\njust a matter of pushing it and\ngetting them to open that or\n\n107\n00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.370\npushing it our of their system somehow.\n\n108\n00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.950\nSo, and that's not the only way,\nby the way.\n\n109\n00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:34.400\nI don't have to go in their system\nto make them go to DNS this way.\n\n110\n00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.980\nIf I have an IP address of a DNS server,\nI could just go ahead and\n\n111\n00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.770\nuse one of the other tools on here,\nthis cache poisoning tool.\n\n112\n00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.070\nI could do this cache poisoning tool and\ngo proactive on the other people's systems\n\n113\n00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.530\nand send out a poisoning request and\ntell them for the IP address for\n\n114\n00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:59.590\nthat specific DNS server, the ARP\nrequest resolves to my MAC address.\n\n115\n00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.320\nSo now what happens is if they happen to\nbe in range on the same subnet as that DNS\n\n116\n00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.460\nserver, they'll redirect to this, and\n\n117\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.000\nnow all of a sudden I've\nintercepted their requests anyway.\n\n118\n00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.705\nSo more than one way to skin\na cat as they say, right?\n\n119\n00:07:11.705 --> 00:07:14.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that's just that side of it.\n\n120\n00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.680\nThen we have, just to go back over here to\nour fake DHCP server, I don't even know if\n\n121\n00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.365\nI really need to even explain that\nanymore than that, that's what it is.\n\n122\n00:07:22.365 --> 00:07:25.100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What's really neat about this is we\n\n123\n00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:30.360\nknow DHCP doesn't automatically\nconfigures IP addresses for you.\n\n124\n00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.270\nAnd you probably already know at this\npoint, the DORA process going through and\n\n125\n00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:41.160\nrequesting that, so what's gonna\nhappen here is if you activate\n\n126\n00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.160\nthis fake DHCP server, all you're gonna\ndo is type in the scope on here and\n\n127\n00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.180\nthe other appropriate information,\nyou take a look at that.\n\n128\n00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.850\nThis is where you can make the fake\nDNS and the fake DHCP work together.\n\n129\n00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:57.600\nAnother way is that you just put your\nstarting into the scope, your subnet mask,\n\n130\n00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.500\nyour gateway, and I like how it even puts\nit in here if you can't read it over on\n\n131\n00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.120\nthe left hand side there.\n\n132\n00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.980\nIt actually has a setting there\nsaying fake DNS right there, so\n\n133\n00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.130\nit's telling you, hey, hint hint,\nwe got a tool over here for that.\n\n134\n00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.260\nSo you could pop that in and put\nan alternate DNS one in there as well and\n\n135\n00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.080\njust have people just go through and\n\n136\n00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.310\nwhen they start asking for IP addresses\ncome on, they're gonna get this one,\n\n137\n00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.408\nand I'll just route their stuff\nright over to my DNS server.\n\n138\n00:08:24.408 --> 00:08:25.900\nOr I'll route them to\na different gate way,\n\n139\n00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.160\nwhich is gonna act as a choke point where\nI could sniff their traffic that way.\n\n140\n00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.660\nSo that opens up a lot of\npossibilities right there.\n\n141\n00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:34.360\nIn fact,\n\n142\n00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:39.830\nthat gateway, I could use one of my other\ntools in Kali which is called SSL Strip.\n\n143\n00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:44.770\nI could use that to say well,\nwhen HTTPS traffic or\n\n144\n00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:49.650\nHTTP traffic comes through, I can make it\nso you do an HTTP request and I turn that\n\n145\n00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:55.790\ninto a HTTPS requested the other site,\nbecause the real site uses HTTPS.\n\n146\n00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:00.710\nSo when you request it,\nit goes through me and I say okay,\n\n147\n00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:04.170\nthat's HTTPS, the request comes back,\nI come back and say,\n\n148\n00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.320\nokay I'm gonna give you HTTP, you type\nin your credentials, it comes to me,\n\n149\n00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.910\nI intercept them but\nI also transfer them back over.\n\n150\n00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.560\nSo everything you do goes back and\nforth through me and I see it.\n\n151\n00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.020\nSo it's a classic man in\nthe middle at that point, and\n\n152\n00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.670\nyou can use this as a stepping\noff point for that.\n\n153\n00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:22.728\nSo its just how you set\nup things ahead of time.\n\n154\n00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:24.890\nOnce you've configured that,\nany one of these tools,\n\n155\n00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.890\nonce you've configured them\nthe way you wanted to,\n\n156\n00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.830\nyou just click start at the bottom and\nit's rocking and rolling.\n\n157\n00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.250\nAnd you can see if you set\nup a fake DHCP server,\n\n158\n00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.450\nyou can see it's gonna work\npretty quickly, it really does.\n\n159\n00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:41.440\nOn a lot of networks, you turn this\nthing on, you turn a DHCP server on, and\n\n160\n00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.210\nyou just sit there and watch,\nyou'll see pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,\n\n161\n00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:48.540\nrequests come in reasonably quickly.\n\n162\n00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.160\nSo that's something to think about,\n\n163\n00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.080\nthat you could actually really\nmonkey with someone's whole day and\n\n164\n00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.595\ncausing a lot of grief, though it caused\nIT admins a lot of grief as well in that.\n\n165\n00:10:01.595 --> 00:10:04.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So here's setting up a fake web server,\n\n166\n00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.940\nso if you wanted to do that whole deal.\n\n167\n00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.510\nThis is, like I said, a one stop solution.\n\n168\n00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.040\nWe've got everything under one roof here.\n\n169\n00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.860\nEverything must go!\n\n170\n00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:10.372\nNo [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n171\n00:10:10.372 --> 00:10:12.730\n>> But we got everything under one roof.\n\n172\n00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:17.440\nWe talked about in here with\ndoing a fake DNS server and\n\n173\n00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.590\nthen rerouting them to a specific website.\n\n174\n00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.080\nWell heck, I can set up\n\n175\n00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.770\na redirect website that I control right\nthrough here through this product.\n\n176\n00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:32.010\nI can go here and say, fake HTTP server\nand to give it an IP address and\n\n177\n00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:36.300\nI can either tell it to make\na xerox copy of another site or\n\n178\n00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.560\nto tell it to go to a specific point and\njust, it'll go right on.\n\n179\n00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.760\nYou populate the information,\nit goes right on through, and so\n\n180\n00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.670\nnow all of a sudden they're getting\nredirected to a website that they\n\n181\n00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.240\nreally don't want to go to.\n\n182\n00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.520\nOr they don't know that they shouldn't\nbe going to, kind of some neat\n\n183\n00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.130\nstuff you could do there, and\nyou're really causing some nasty things.\n\n184\n00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:02.610\nI think this is kind of interesting down\nhere, is that they even have this tool\n\n185\n00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:07.020\nset up that you can tell it\nhow it's gonna be running.\n\n186\n00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.800\nIt has an option here,\nit's got a credential capture mode.\n\n187\n00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.770\nDoesn't even try to hold back and\nsay, well,\n\n188\n00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.820\nthis is, we're doing a little bit of this.\n\n189\n00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:19.090\nNo, it's like, no, we are going to\nsteal your password, deal with it.\n\n190\n00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.299\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what it's telling you\n\n191\n00:11:20.299 --> 00:11:20.880\nright there.\n\n192\n00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.940\n[LAUGH] It doesn't get\nany clearer than that.\n\n193\n00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.590\nSo we've got that being dealt\nwith right from the get go.\n\n194\n00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:31.020\nSo that's something else\nthat Ghost Phisher does do.\n\n195\n00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:36.270\nNow I'll skip over the ghost trap here for\nright now and I'll come back to it.\n\n196\n00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.270\nI'm not gonna let that go.\n\n197\n00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.890\nSo I've got some other stuff in here and\nhere's a session hijacking.\n\n198\n00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:46.520\nSession hijacking,\nas you would expect, you can tell it,\n\n199\n00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:52.010\nhere's stuff gonna come through this\nactual system, and you can tell\n\n200\n00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:57.570\nit how to monitor this and it'll start\nmonitoring it and then when you want to,\n\n201\n00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.480\nyou can just tell it to take over the\nsession and then you've got control of it.\n\n202\n00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.290\nIt can do that, right through here.\n\n203\n00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.840\nI'm not doing this because I don't have\nany active sessions right here to do.\n\n204\n00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.680\nThis is just to show you\nthe possibilities of the tool in here.\n\n205\n00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.900\nSo this is one, yeah,\nyou can do that with this as well.\n\n206\n00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.060\nSo if you need to or if you want to do\nthat, you can sit there and do this, or\n\n207\n00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.195\nyou can just just run it in a passive\nmode which means it's basically\n\n208\n00:12:21.195 --> 00:12:24.640\ngonna run as a sniffing type device.\n\n209\n00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.365\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n210\n00:12:25.365 --> 00:12:28.155\n>> So you've got that and\nthen there's our Poisoning tool.\n\n211\n00:12:28.155 --> 00:12:29.495\nLike I said, I talked about that.\n\n212\n00:12:29.495 --> 00:12:31.305\nYou could tell it to go out there and\n\n213\n00:12:31.305 --> 00:12:35.865\nstart putting in proactively\ninto people's systems.\n\n214\n00:12:35.865 --> 00:12:41.225\nYou could start tell it to proactively\nput some stuff on people's systems so\n\n215\n00:12:41.225 --> 00:12:44.980\nit resolves different ways and\n\n216\n00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:49.680\nthen there's credentials on\nthis here on the last one.\n\n217\n00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.610\nSo if you're running some of those other\nutilities that do harvest credentials and\n\n218\n00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.610\nlook for that, it'll start going pop,\npop, pop, right down the list here.\n\n219\n00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.330\nSo when people go to those web sites,\nit'll tell you the web site and\n\n220\n00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.320\ntell you the user and\npassword that they used if it grabbed it.\n\n221\n00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.620\nIf you ran the session hijack, you ran\nany of that type of stuff it'll just go\n\n222\n00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.630\nahead and grab it for you automatically.\n\n223\n00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:08.130\n>> Nice.\n>> So.\n\n224\n00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.980\n>> It doesn't get too much easier.\n\n225\n00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.430\n>> Yeah, they're really making\nit easy when you look at this.\n\n226\n00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:17.900\nBut, let's kind of go\nback around to that one,\n\n227\n00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:22.010\nthe big boy here, is what I kind\nof consider the big boy here.\n\n228\n00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.470\nIt's the only one there that's\ngot the word ghost in it.\n\n229\n00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.850\nThey went through calling\nthis thing Ghost Phisher and\n\n230\n00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:31.912\nthere's only one tool that has\nanything even mentioning ghost in it.\n\n231\n00:13:31.912 --> 00:13:33.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n232\n00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:37.260\nwhat we have here is you have\nthis Ghost Trap utility,\n\n233\n00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:43.370\nis you can tell it same deal interface and\nIP address and all that.\n\n234\n00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.300\nBut when you get down here and\nyou're actually starting it with all\n\n235\n00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.860\nthese configuration options it's\ntelling you, it's telling you\n\n236\n00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:55.790\nstuff about saving cookies, about forcing\npeople to download certain payloads,\n\n237\n00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.860\nrespond only to a certain operating\nsystem, in this case Windows.\n\n238\n00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:04.070\nBut what you see down here\non the bottom half of this,\n\n239\n00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.410\nstarting right at this bottom\nhalf where you see my arrow is,\n\n240\n00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:12.170\nif you can't read that,\nit says Metasploit payload settings, okay?\n\n241\n00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:17.130\nSo now I've taken all the other\ntools in this suite, and\n\n242\n00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:22.530\nyou actually can look at Ghost Phisher as\na suite of tools, this one now has brought\n\n243\n00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:29.250\nin Medasploit into the fold so what's\nhappening here is that you can configure\n\n244\n00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:35.190\nthis to go to a specific location.\n\n245\n00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:40.330\nOn your specific website you could do\nsomething like that and once you've\n\n246\n00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:45.560\ntold these devices to go to that and they\nhit that location, remember we can tell\n\n247\n00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.830\nthese things, go to this point, we can put\nan IP address or whatever saying, go here.\n\n248\n00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.710\nThey get redirected to there.\n\n249\n00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.690\nIt will detect if I want,\nare they a Windows a system,\n\n250\n00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:55.900\nare they not a Windows system?\n\n251\n00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:01.090\nIt will pick up certain settings, and then\nI can tell it what payload I want to use,\n\n252\n00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:05.800\nand they go there, and notice it's got\nthe Windows payload and Linux payloads.\n\n253\n00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.470\nYou can tell it hey,\ndrop this off on the system.\n\n254\n00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.610\nYou can tell it what\nsystem to dial back on it.\n\n255\n00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.210\nYou can even tell it over here,\nport to respond to.\n\n256\n00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:19.030\nRemember when we went through\nMetasploit we had that L host and\n\n257\n00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.474\nR host, the local host to remote host.\n\n258\n00:15:21.474 --> 00:15:24.250\nAnd so it told that payload\nwho to dial back to, so\n\n259\n00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:28.340\nwhen it opened up a reverse shell,\nit knew hey, go to this IP address and\n\n260\n00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.600\ntalk to this port because\nthat guys listening for you.\n\n261\n00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.140\nAnd so that's what you're telling us here,\n\n262\n00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.660\nthat when this is pushed off on some\nsystem, there's the IP address sitting\n\n263\n00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.230\nnext to what I just have highlighted\nover there to the right.\n\n264\n00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:45.090\nIt's gonna go to that IP address, so this\nIP address on this system to that port,\n\n265\n00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:49.400\nit's gonna make that reverse\nshell out to it, contact it.\n\n266\n00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.690\nAnd I could be pushing Meterpreter\non that system at this point, or\n\n267\n00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:56.010\nsome other payload on that system,\nand taken control of it.\n\n268\n00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:02.790\nWell, so if that's where you really start\ncoming into that huge amount of power.\n\n269\n00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:06.090\nThe other tools you have in\nhere are fake DNS and DHCP and\n\n270\n00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.930\nall that jazz, those are actually\nreally great in themselves.\n\n271\n00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.280\nI mean, all those things,\n\n272\n00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.220\nthere's a lot of stuff you can\ndo with that as a pen tester.\n\n273\n00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.580\nBut now I'm taking it to a whole\nother level here is that I'm saying,\n\n274\n00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:20.590\nonce I've got you on the hook and I'm\nreeling you in, what I have at the end of\n\n275\n00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:24.120\nthat whole thing is when I pull the end\nof the boat I got Metasploit waiting for\n\n276\n00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.815\nyou and I'm going to shove it down\nyour throat when you get there.\n\n277\n00:16:26.815 --> 00:16:27.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n278\n00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.320\nat that point I'm taking\ncontrol of your system or\n\n279\n00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.040\nI'm pushing additional things off on your\nsystem once I've got Meterpreter there.\n\n280\n00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.060\nSo it comes across as something\nthat when you initially look at,\n\n281\n00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.270\nit's a very simple looking tool and\nall that.\n\n282\n00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.990\nBut, the reality is this is probably one\nof the more devastating tools you can\n\n283\n00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.110\nrun into.\n\n284\n00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:48.360\nAnd this just brings,\nthe big thing I was trying to show,\n\n285\n00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.230\nis the number of the diversity of\ntools in this, but also we've got,\n\n286\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.320\nat the end there we saw Metasploit\ncoming back into the picture.\n\n287\n00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.500\nSo we're now integrating that\nstuff that we know before,\n\n288\n00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.220\nthat stuff we have knowledge of.\n\n289\n00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.570\nYou're not seeing everything in Metasploit\nhere cuz when we did Metasploit\n\n290\n00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:07.960\nwe did it through the console and\nthen we also did it through Armitage.\n\n291\n00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.720\nSo we saw that.\n\n292\n00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.870\nWe're not seeing that here.\n\n293\n00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:14.230\nBut, it is still doing much\nof the same thing for us,\n\n294\n00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.270\nit's just running the scripts\nbehind the scenes for us.\n\n295\n00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.890\nWe peel this away,\nwe'd see the scripts actually running.\n\n296\n00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.520\nSo, we know what's going on.\n\n297\n00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.430\nWe know what the meaning of these\npayloads and all that are and\n\n298\n00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.460\nso we've got that knowledge\nthat makes it much easier for\n\n299\n00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.900\nus to configure this and\nreally do the damage.\n\n300\n00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.600\n>> Very good.\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, there you go.\n\n301\n00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.140\nReally good look at\nGhost Phisher by Sean Oriyano.\n\n302\n00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:38.099\nWe've got more how-tos coming your way so\nstay

00:00:20.366\n>> Oh we're gonna have some fun.\n\n6\n00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You bet that.\n\n7\n00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.871\nSparta, its a another tool\nthat's in the category\n\n8\n00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:32.320\nof what we saw with\nGhostfisher it does a lot.\n\n9\n00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.835\nThere was some crossover\nwith what Ghostfisher does.\n\n10\n00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:38.270\nThey're in the same category as being\nsomething that's a suite of tools.\n\n11\n00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.520\nSparta comes in at a different angle,\nI guess is the best way to put it.\n\n12\n00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.660\nSo you see, Ghostfisher doing one thing,\nand Ghostfisher is really one of\n\n13\n00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.880\nthose things that can help you with\ndoing different types of attacks.\n\n14\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.350\nThat's one of the things it does, a little\nmore on that side than Sparta does.\n\n15\n00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.010\nBut Sparta has some different\nways of gaining information.\n\n16\n00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.340\nAnd then it can launch some\nof its own strikes too.\n\n17\n00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.340\nIt's kind of neat from that perspective.\n\n18\n00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.580\nSweda things.\n\n19\n00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.270\nYou can use this to get other\nstuff to really get quite a bit.\n\n20\n00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.950\nSome might look at Sparta as being\nmore on the reconnaissance side of\n\n21\n00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.910\nthings than it is the actual scanning and\n\n22\n00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.260\nattack side of things but,\nwell you know what I say to that,\n\n23\n00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.100\nwhen people look at this thing and they\nsay, isn't that a reconnaissance tool?\n\n24\n00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.700\nAnd I'm like reconnaissance tool?\n\n25\n00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.928\nThis is Sparta.\n\n26\n00:01:32.928 --> 00:01:35.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I should have brought in just like\n\n27\n00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.740\nflex, shoot that again I'll do it,\nI'll add cooler stuff.\n\n28\n00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.250\n[LAUGH] So, all right,\nI should be eating raw meat and\n\n29\n00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.780\njust throwing it down at that point,\nbut let's talk.\n\n30\n00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.970\nSo what we have here is I've\ngot it up on the screen,\n\n31\n00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.090\nI've got Sparta up on a screen here.\n\n32\n00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.450\nWhat I've done is I've already\ngone ahead and run a scan for\n\n33\n00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.970\nyou just because it can take some time.\n\n34\n00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.730\nAnd what you do is you\njust add your host or\n\n35\n00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.620\nhosts as the case may\nbe into this utility.\n\n36\n00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.375\nAnd so I just have the one that again\nis my my metasploitable system.\n\n37\n00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:13.160\nSo I went ahead and let it run the scan.\n\n38\n00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.720\nYou can see kind of the remnants\nof that at the bottom.\n\n39\n00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.320\nYou can see it ran a lot\nof different scans.\n\n40\n00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.510\nIt runs specific.\n\n41\n00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.220\nIt didn't run just one generic scan,\nit actually ran specific scans as well.\n\n42\n00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.160\nAnd so\nit's pretty flexible in that manner too.\n\n43\n00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.505\nYou're not limited to one type of scan and\n\n44\n00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:34.950\nit can actually combine different\ntypes of scans for you.\n\n45\n00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.990\nYou don't have to go to different\ntools that can say, okay,\n\n46\n00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.610\nwell, Nmap does this good, this does this\npretty well, this does this pretty well.\n\n47\n00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.700\nHey, tell me, you know what I wanna do,\ntell me what options you want, and\n\n48\n00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.000\nI will go ahead and\nput the combination of tools,\n\n49\n00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.270\nthe correct switches together,\nto get to the result that you want.\n\n50\n00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.961\n>> These tools have to be installed,\nand are you're picking which tools it's\n\n51\n00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:56.186\nrunning or is it just seeing\nwhat you got and going with it?\n\n52\n00:02:56.186 --> 00:02:59.648\n>> It assumes that you have\nit when you install this.\n\n53\n00:02:59.648 --> 00:03:02.620\nAnd this is something\nthat they do tell you\n\n54\n00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.250\nwhen you get this that there\nare some requirements, but.\n\n55\n00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.850\nIf you saw us on requirement should\nbe met, Nmaps should be there,\n\n56\n00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.790\nunicorn scan should be there,\nthose ones should already be in place,\n\n57\n00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.680\nif not it'll tell you when you install\nit that these things need to be here\n\n58\n00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.100\nbefore you can unleash the full\npower of this software.\n\n59\n00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.930\nSo with what we've got.\n\n60\n00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.290\nSo I let it run its scan.\n\n61\n00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.130\nSo there's the host, and you can see what\nI've got bunch of tabs across the top.\n\n62\n00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.560\nThat's the easy stuff right there.\n\n63\n00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.770\nYou can see it very quickly\ngetting the results of a scan.\n\n64\n00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.240\nOkay now that's not really,\nyou know, too exciting.\n\n65\n00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.350\nThat's something that we've seen that\ndoesn't really surprise us, you know,\n\n66\n00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.350\nat this point.\n\n67\n00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.660\nI went ahead and ran some scripts for me.\n\n68\n00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.094\nI don't have any loaded in here, but\n\n69\n00:03:51.094 --> 00:03:54.300\nyou can also customize the scan\nwith scripts if you want.\n\n70\n00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.260\nThis is also geared towards someone\nthat is doing penetration testing for\n\n71\n00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.840\nsure, kinda for professional, cuz not\nonly is it give you the information,\n\n72\n00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.090\nit also gives you a place to put notes and\nsave it out.\n\n73\n00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.850\nSo when you do the scan, you can take\nnotes right in here and save it out for\n\n74\n00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.610\nreporting purposes,\nwhich is absolutely awesome.\n\n75\n00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.920\nThere you can see when it starts doing the\nscans, it was actually looking at them.\n\n76\n00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.540\nIt was going to hear port 80 and\nit went in port 80 and\n\n77\n00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.110\ndid the query against it and\nwhat did it find in that query.\n\n78\n00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.020\nIf I scroll up to the top of this, look at\nthe tool that it actually ran right here.\n\n79\n00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.340\nYou could see that it ran Nikto for me.\n\n80\n00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.700\nIt went right ahead and loaded that tool.\n\n81\n00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.680\nAs part of its scan and said,\nokay, well, Nicto did this.\n\n82\n00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.730\nI found port 80 open.\n\n83\n00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.780\nI know that's a web service.\n\n84\n00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.080\nLet's go ahead and fire up Nicto,\nand have it brought to bear on this.\n\n85\n00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.900\nAnd so it went ahead and crunched away and\nit found some information.\n\n86\n00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.180\nSo we can go through that and\n\n87\n00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.810\nsee If there's anything of interest to us\nthat may allow us to do a further attack.\n\n88\n00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.450\nIn here, I see information about being\nApache and all that good stuff, and I even\n\n89\n00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.430\nsee some specific exploit numbers in there\ntoo, which really kind of catches my eye.\n\n90\n00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.130\nSo it's doing some pretty thorough stuff\nalready at this point, but we're not done.\n\n91\n00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.790\nWe're really not done with this.\n\n92\n00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.380\n[LAUGH] But it went in and\ntook a screenshot of the thing for me.\n\n93\n00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.230\nI mean what else can you really ask for?\n\n94\n00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.700\nIt pulled up the web default webpage, took\na screenshot and brought it back to me.\n\n95\n00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.649\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's SMTP and\n\n96\n00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:29.772\nwhat it's doing here is through SMTP,\nit is actually,\n\n97\n00:05:29.772 --> 00:05:33.805\nit's doing of course\na scan against this but\n\n98\n00:05:33.805 --> 00:05:39.380\n[LAUGH] what it did is a scan it\nwent through it's this verify.\n\n99\n00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.510\nIt's actually looking for,\n\n100\n00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.450\nit's got a list of default usernames that\nare used on some of these services, and\n\n101\n00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.220\nso it just went through to verify\nif those accounts actually exist.\n\n102\n00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.560\nSo you start scrolling down the list here.\n\n103\n00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.110\nOh, well,\nlook at the type of stuff it's finding.\n\n104\n00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.530\nIt's finding some stuff that, you know.\n\n105\n00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:58.930\nThat are of interest.\n\n106\n00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.620\nIt's got stuff like root and all in there.\n\n107\n00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.550\nYou saw it's got some other\nstuff looks like it, so\n\n108\n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.900\nwe'd have to kind of sort through to it to\nsee if it's all actually truly correct.\n\n109\n00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.300\nBut you can see see stuff in here like\nroot and stuff like that already existing,\n\n110\n00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.882\nso we're getting that.\n\n111\n00:06:11.882 --> 00:06:16.780\nMy SQL is actually installed in\nthis system too on Metasploitable.\n\n112\n00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.950\nWe've never done anything against\nany of the stuff here, we will.\n\n113\n00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.370\nBut we have a situation where,\nlook what it found?\n\n114\n00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.990\nIt found, hey I queried it.\n\n115\n00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.830\nI found my SQL on 3306 and here we go.\n\n116\n00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.760\nThere's the, here's the information\nit has just at that cursory level.\n\n117\n00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.560\nI mean it has, it even found, you know it\nlooks like here it found the login name.\n\n118\n00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.870\nNow log in root right there.\n\n119\n00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:45.330\nSo I was able to do that, and\nthis is even a little scarier here,\n\n120\n00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.870\nif you can't read this, is that it says\none of one targets successfully completed,\n\n121\n00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.380\none valid password found.\n\n122\n00:06:53.685 --> 00:06:58.060\nOh, and on it's own, it already found\na way to get into that system, and\n\n123\n00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.590\nit's got that stored in its notes.\n\n124\n00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.430\nAnd what did it do to run that?\n\n125\n00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:07.240\nIt went ahead and, on this system,\nit grabbed a tool called THC hydra,\n\n126\n00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.840\nwhich is a password cracker for\nweb applications.\n\n127\n00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.010\nIt went ahead and said, oh, guess what,\nI found this in here, I found MySQL.\n\n128\n00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.130\nLet me see if I can password crack,\n\n129\n00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.850\nlet me go to THC hydra, load\nthe parameters in there and say, have at.\n\n130\n00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.030\nAnd it did.\n\n131\n00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.000\nIt went through and\nit found that information.\n\n132\n00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.650\n>> Yeah, so.\n\n133\n00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.630\n>> I mean, this is getting to be to\nthe point where it's almost too easy.\n\n134\n00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:36.320\nSo here, you have Hydras,\nthis is another password cracker.\n\n135\n00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.170\nLook at this.\n\n136\n00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.420\nBecause this was a default installation,\n\n137\n00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.670\nthis is where default\ninstallations kill you.\n\n138\n00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:47.190\nIs this is that postgress I\njust always say it that way.\n\n139\n00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.070\nBut it's found it running.\n\n140\n00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.670\nIt queried the service and\ndid a banner grab.\n\n141\n00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:55.510\nAnd said okay well I found this\nit did some logins with it, and\n\n142\n00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.670\nit found that the login postgress and\nthe password postgress work.\n\n143\n00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:04.360\nSo again I got a foothold into\nthat service as well now.\n\n144\n00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.310\nSo you keep moving along,\nwhat else do we have?\n\n145\n00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.690\nSo there's some other ones that are run.\n\n146\n00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.270\nThere's FTP.\n\n147\n00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.390\nWell, it found FTP, it queried it,\nfound a password there.\n\n148\n00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.260\nIt's just having a field day with this.\n\n149\n00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.590\nIt's like no mercy with this stuff.\n\n150\n00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:18.960\nRight down the list.\n\n151\n00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.160\nThis one didn't find anything here or\nany passwords but it did find that, yeah,\n\n152\n00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.090\nthere's something else\nrunning with FTP there.\n\n153\n00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:31.000\nThere's our X11 service for\ndoing stuff on screen.\n\n154\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.470\nThere's some additional\ninformation on what Nikto found.\n\n155\n00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:38.080\nAnd this would be useful if we were gonna\ngo to the next step and start penetrating\n\n156\n00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.020\nand punching around the web server and\nweb application side of things.\n\n157\n00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:47.320\nIt's already telling you the methods that\nit found that work these get, head, posts,\n\n158\n00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.560\nall those things.\n\n159\n00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:54.080\nThose all are ways that we can use to\ntransfer information back and forth.\n\n160\n00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.420\nBut those are things that we can\nuse to further later attacks.\n\n161\n00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.010\nSo that's handy.\n\n162\n00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.880\nAnd there's something with the 8180 port.\n\n163\n00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.740\nFound that one open, and\nlook what it's got there.\n\n164\n00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.110\nI took a screenshot of that and said,\nhere's what was a present there.\n\n165\n00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.400\nLike I said,\nyou can keep going on right down the line.\n\n166\n00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.550\nI won't go through everything in here.\n\n167\n00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.000\nThere's SM, there's SMB.\n\n168\n00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.980\nLook at that one as a matter of fact.\n\n169\n00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.150\nThis target isn't vulnerable.\n\n170\n00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.240\nLook what it was scanning for.\n\n171\n00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.320\nIt's scanning for that MS8-067.\n\n172\n00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.866\nThat's the corn thicker and\n\n173\n00:09:27.866 --> 00:09:32.780\nthat's the one where we used on XP to\npush the meta interpreter onto a system.\n\n174\n00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.680\nThat's the same one it was scanning for\nto see if this was open.\n\n175\n00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.510\nWhat it did find here interestingly enough\nis right here the two lines with SMB\n\n176\n00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.570\nservice.\n\n177\n00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.660\nIt found two passwords for it.\n\n178\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.990\nFound login user, password user,\nlogin MSFN admin.\n\n179\n00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.909\nAnd the password will be the same.\n\n180\n00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.660\nYou know so it's really done a lot so\n\n181\n00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.740\nwe've got you know all those things\ngoing there some banner grabs and\n\n182\n00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.290\nthere's the unicorn scan, there's some you\nknow other screen shots being taken but.\n\n183\n00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:03.180\nKinda get the point.\n\n184\n00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.720\nIt's gathered a lot at that point.\n\n185\n00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.050\nThat's already interesting but\nwhat else does this thing have?\n\n186\n00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:15.150\nWell you could see up top it has this\nscan and it has a Brute tab up here.\n\n187\n00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:19.510\nYou click on the Brute tab, you wanna\nreally kind of fine tune, you wanna go\n\n188\n00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:25.330\nbeyond the cursory kind of password\ncracking that Sparta can do on its own.\n\n189\n00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:27.750\nYou can tweak that.\n\n190\n00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.190\nYou can load your own\ndictionary files in here.\n\n191\n00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.410\nAnd so on and so forth.\n\n192\n00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.939\nAnd then you can take these things,\nload it and re-target it towards one of\n\n193\n00:10:35.939 --> 00:10:39.030\nthe things that Sparta already\ntargeted and got the tool for you.\n\n194\n00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.200\nYou could try to do it again and\nsee if it couldn't break it.\n\n195\n00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.770\nCan you break it loading a more\nextensive list with a custom dictionary,\n\n196\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.890\nmaybe that would get you some traction.\n\n197\n00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:54.700\nSo it can do these things, it can run them\nagainst multiple services, if you want,\n\n198\n00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.450\nat the same time.\n\n199\n00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.760\nSo it can do a lot of that.\n\n200\n00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.520\nGoing back over to the scanning side,\nwhat else can we do over there.\n\n201\n00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.800\nThere's our, of course,\nour services being listed.\n\n202\n00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.010\nTools we can use.\n\n203\n00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:11.190\nIf you want to re-task a tool towards\nsomething all you have to do.\n\n204\n00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:16.110\nI've only got these services\navailable cuz I've selected FTP, but\n\n205\n00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.470\nas I select different services,\nsince I already ran the scan,\n\n206\n00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.740\nit's brought those tools out there,\nsaid I used these, but\n\n207\n00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:28.230\nit's also saying when you click on\nanything like Nikto, Nikto says I can't.\n\n208\n00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.660\nNikto doesn't work with my SQL.\n\n209\n00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.820\nDoesn't work with FTP or\nwith these other ones on there.\n\n210\n00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.410\nIt works with specifically\nwith stuff over HTTP.\n\n211\n00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.490\nSo what is it doing?\n\n212\n00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.350\nIt's just showing stuff that\nwas being configured for that.\n\n213\n00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:40.350\nYou know, so it's fine tuning.\n\n214\n00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:41.470\nIt's saying do you want to rerun this?\n\n215\n00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.890\nIf I wanna rerun it, I can right-click\non it and look what it does.\n\n216\n00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:49.380\nNot only does it lie to rerun the tool,\nI can say okay, open a telnet session and\n\n217\n00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.470\nsee if there's anything that can happen.\n\n218\n00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.520\nYou could open a netcat session right\nthrough here as well, same type of deal.\n\n219\n00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.910\nBut you've got other\ntools on there as well,\n\n220\n00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:04.130\nyou've got things to you know,\nto open up the directories on there and,\n\n221\n00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:08.015\nyou know, all sorts of other,\nyou know, interesting little things.\n\n222\n00:12:08.015 --> 00:12:09.480\nYou can run additional scans.\n\n223\n00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.770\nI went ahead and right-clicked and\n\n224\n00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:13.070\nread something called Wetweb\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n225\n00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:17.260\nAnd, you know, it went through,\nit ran and it, and it finished it.\n\n226\n00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.320\nYou know, so you'll see the scans\nthat's actively running down there.\n\n227\n00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.210\nYou know, so, there kinda you go.\n\n228\n00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:30.310\nIt's like you can really kind of start\nfine tuning your actual results more here.\n\n229\n00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.120\nIf you don't like the ones it came\nup with, you can say, well okay,\n\n230\n00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.850\nthat's a good start but\nthat's not really enough for me.\n\n231\n00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.590\nSo I need to go one step further.\n\n232\n00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.460\nSo you can get in there and say, hey,\nthat gave me what I need to get started.\n\n233\n00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.910\nMaybe it's not what I want, but\nI got started down that path.\n\n234\n00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:47.630\nSo now I can use this to kind of tweak and\ndo some fine tuning and\n\n235\n00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.920\nget back to more where I want to be.\n\n236\n00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.540\nYeah so it's extremely versatile.\n\n237\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.700\nYou can see the different types\nof things that are available.\n\n238\n00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.000\nI just ran a scan down here and\nnoticed it ran it down there.\n\n239\n00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.770\nYou saw the bar move really quick.\n\n240\n00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:03.670\nThis showed up down here.\n\n241\n00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.540\nThis SSL.\n\n242\n00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.610\nIt's analyzing the SSL option on here, and\n\n243\n00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.460\nits saying well,\nwhat information does it have about SSL?\n\n244\n00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.620\nWell it went through, and\nit did a quick analysis of that port, and\n\n245\n00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.510\nit's saying hey, this is what I've found.\n\n246\n00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:20.290\nIt went through and connected to it,\nand I can just read through that and\n\n247\n00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.900\nsee what it would do.\n\n248\n00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.480\nLook at how easy it would be.\n\n249\n00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.640\nRemember that poodle\nattack we talked about?\n\n250\n00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:31.040\nYou know, we talked about that in our\ncast, if you didn't get to see that.\n\n251\n00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.830\nThe cast we talked about the pool attack,\n\n252\n00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.380\nwhat that is, is where it's\nbasically an SSL downgrade attack.\n\n253\n00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:41.340\nIt's where someone comes in, can't use\nTLS, and TLS is the new secure standard.\n\n254\n00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.490\nSo what you do, is you force them to,\nyou force the server to say,\n\n255\n00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.970\nwell I'm a client I can't\nsupport the new stuff, so\n\n256\n00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.950\nyou're gonna have to get me back to\nthe old stuff that I can support.\n\n257\n00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:56.120\nAnd what happens is you come in and you\nquery the system, so it tells you that.\n\n258\n00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.660\nAnd you push it down with the old one and\nthe old one is broken.\n\n259\n00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.750\nSo you get in that way through a broken\nprotocol and now you're on the system now.\n\n260\n00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.150\nAnd doing your,\nwhatever mischief you want to accomplish.\n\n261\n00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.370\nSo how would you know it\nsupports those old protocols.\n\n262\n00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.010\nRight there.\n\n263\n00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:12.770\nSparta can do it.\n\n264\n00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.310\nYou could run SSL yourself, but\n\n265\n00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:21.400\nif you're someone that wants to do\nit in a quicker way, here you go.\n\n266\n00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.850\nThat's what I have right there.\n\n267\n00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:29.048\nIt's got information about\nthat part of security.\n\n268\n00:14:29.048 --> 00:14:33.520\nSo just I think a really\nkind of a neat thing for\n\n269\n00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.429\nus to have available in our arsenal,\n\n270\n00:14:38.429 --> 00:14:41.100\nso I don't even know what\nreally else to add to it.\n\n271\n00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:46.210\nI mean I just like the way this works so\nwell that it saves me so much time\n\n272\n00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:52.310\nthat it is, it saves me so much time,\nyou know, it's almost invaluable.\n\n273\n00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.720\nNow, it's not bringing in\nmeta-spooling stuff like that.\n\n274\n00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.750\nI mean, that was something that our\nother tool did, that Ghostfisher did.\n\n275\n00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:05.870\nSo, it doesn't have that, but, and you\nhave to take that stuff over there, but\n\n276\n00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.120\nthis does other things\nthat Ghostfisher doesn't.\n\n277\n00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.330\nGhostfisher doesn't allow this\nextensive amount of scans.\n\n278\n00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.540\nIt doesn't allow for\nthis level of password cracking.\n\n279\n00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.110\nIt'll sniff to see if it\nfinds those credentials.\n\n280\n00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:19.310\nBut it won't do it like this one will.\n\n281\n00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:24.330\nThis one will not only break the passwords\nfor you, if it can, off a simple list,\n\n282\n00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:29.860\nit will go through and let you load\nyour own and say, hey, fine tune it.\n\n283\n00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:30.860\nYou want better results?\n\n284\n00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.930\nOkay, bring your own dictionary file and\nyou can load that in there.\n\n285\n00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.760\nAnd the reason why it was able\nto find those things so easily,\n\n286\n00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.580\nthose passwords weren't\nexactly secure passwords.\n\n287\n00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.950\nIt wasn't like someone\nwas trying to hide it.\n\n288\n00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.720\nThey put them out there you know so\n\n289\n00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.830\nif I put something there with special\ncharacters in there, this may not find it.\n\n290\n00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:52.250\nBut that's where your custom dictionary\nlists and doing other types of attacks\n\n291\n00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:57.240\nwhere you tweak it and fine tune it to\nwhat you expect or types of things that\n\n292\n00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.520\nyou would expect to see that it\nwould be more proficient at it.\n\n293\n00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.690\nBut nonetheless the fact that it would\neven find that there's some ability there\n\n294\n00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.380\nto even see if you could try a password,\n\n295\n00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.780\nthat's a big leap that you\ncan even get to that point.\n\n296\n00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:15.110\nAnd combining the fact that you can use\nstuff like Telnet to attach to a port and\n\n297\n00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.770\npull and connect to it or\nuse Netcat to go to it and\n\n298\n00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.500\nget more information about it and\ndo all that.\n\n299\n00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.360\nI mean, heck,\nreally how easy can you make it?\n\n300\n00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.160\nIt's almost, it's almost cheating\nwhen you look at something like this.\n\n301\n00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.760\nI'm not going to say it is but it's almost\ngetting to that point where it's so easy.\n\n302\n00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.780\nThat you don't have to put\nmuch thought into it really.\n\n303\n00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.870\nYou can just click a few buttons and\ndo that.\n\n304\n00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.310\nAnd I should say a word about that though,\n\n305\n00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:45.160\nI'm not showing you stuff like this so\nyou don't have to learn the other stuff.\n\n306\n00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.860\nThat's kind of the perception\nwhen you see something like this.\n\n307\n00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.940\nLike, well this does it,\nwhy learn the other stuff, you know?\n\n308\n00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.540\nWhy do it that way at the command line?\n\n309\n00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.340\nIsn't that something that's just\ninefficient when you have this nice,\n\n310\n00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.020\npretty GUI.\n\n311\n00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.710\nI would never ever look at it that way.\n\n312\n00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.670\nI look at it from the viewpoint that\n\n313\n00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:06.510\nyou have this tool that\nhelps you speed things up.\n\n314\n00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.530\nIt makes your process more efficient.\n\n315\n00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:13.010\nHowever, you can still do stuff above and\nbeyond this.\n\n316\n00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:16.530\nThis stuff does fairly generic,\neffective, but\n\n317\n00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.060\nfairly generic scans in\nthe scheme of things.\n\n318\n00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:24.960\nYou can really go to town if you know\nthe individual tools underneath,\n\n319\n00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.600\nand even if just looking at this stuff,\nyou look at the results of what comes out,\n\n320\n00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.300\nyou can say, well,\nI know I can get more, so without.\n\n321\n00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.010\nI don't even have to go to the command\nline, I can go over here and right-click\n\n322\n00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:38.510\nand tell it what to ask for, cuz I know\nhaving used that tool at the command line,\n\n323\n00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:42.420\nthat there's more power to be had of this\nso I just have to go and when I launch\n\n324\n00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:46.620\nthe scanner and manually tell it,\nfeed these additional parameters in.\n\n325\n00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.310\nSo it will do this additional stuff that\nI know it's more than capable of doing.\n\n326\n00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:55.510\nDon't ever underestimate doing\nthe stuff at the command line and\n\n327\n00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:59.070\nbeing just proficient at that or\n\n328\n00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:02.540\njust using the bare tools, maybe they're\nnot necessarily the command line tool, but\n\n329\n00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:06.335\nusing the tools directly and\nget familiarized with what they do,\n\n330\n00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:10.500\ncuz when these things combine them,\nthey make them a lot more powerful but\n\n331\n00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.470\nyou still need to know how\nthose underlying things work.\n\n332\n00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.710\nSo don't cheat yourself.\n\n333\n00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:19.540\n>> All right, there you go, like Sean\nsaid, another tool for our arsenal.\n\n334\n00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.010\nAll right, we hope you enjoyed this one.\n\n335\n00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:26.992\nStay tuned for more how-tos, coming soon.\n\n336\n00:18:26.992 -->

00:00:13.702\nwe're gonna take a look\nat a program called BeEF.\n\n4\n00:00:13.702 --> 00:00:16.413\nAnd Sean I don't even know\nwhere to go from there so\n\n5\n00:00:16.413 --> 00:00:18.358\nI'm just gonna hand it over to you.\n\n6\n00:00:18.358 --> 00:00:19.286\n>> Where do you need to go?\n\n7\n00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:21.840\n[LAUGH]\n>> The dinner table, evidently.\n\n8\n00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.664\n>> Pretty much.\n\n9\n00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:24.523\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n10\n00:00:24.523 --> 00:00:25.498\n>> So what the heck is BeEF?\n\n11\n00:00:25.498 --> 00:00:26.345\nWhat do we use it for?\n\n12\n00:00:26.345 --> 00:00:27.659\nWhy do we want it?\n\n13\n00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:33.035\n>> BeEF has got an interesting name but\nwhat that actually stands for\n\n14\n00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:36.261\nis browser exploitation framework and\n\n15\n00:00:36.261 --> 00:00:41.846\nonce you know what BeEF stands for,\nyou kind of get where it fits in.\n\n16\n00:00:41.846 --> 00:00:47.743\nSo it is a tool designed to target\nthe client side, specifically browsers.\n\n17\n00:00:47.743 --> 00:00:52.676\nSo what we're doing here is we're\nsaying that we'll have a tool that when\n\n18\n00:00:52.676 --> 00:00:58.510\nsomeone visits a website, we're able to\ndo what they call hook in the browser.\n\n19\n00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.460\nAnd once we hook a browser we are able to\nget information out of them, as well as\n\n20\n00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.470\nrun stuff against that browser and\npotentially compromise a system this way.\n\n21\n00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.287\nCuz this may be the way you have to do it.\n\n22\n00:01:10.287 --> 00:01:14.385\nWe've seen in other courses we've done,\nwe've seen other areas,\n\n23\n00:01:14.385 --> 00:01:19.331\nwe've seen tools for example, metasploit,\nthat allows us to open a remote shells\n\n24\n00:01:19.331 --> 00:01:22.742\non a system and\nwe saw that that was actually pretty easy.\n\n25\n00:01:22.742 --> 00:01:27.020\nWe saw stuff with Kaylee itself that\nallowed us to do some interesting\n\n26\n00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.224\nbreak-ins on a system but\nreality is when you look at something like\n\n27\n00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:35.330\nmetasploit just to kind of turn\nthe attention towards that.\n\n28\n00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.670\nMetasploit made things very easy.\n\n29\n00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.180\nWe know that.\n\n30\n00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.790\nWe saw that.\n\n31\n00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.710\nAnd then Armitage written on top\nof that made it even easier.\n\n32\n00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.720\nBut, the reality is is that,\n\n33\n00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.900\ngetting a remote shell in\na system has gotten tougher.\n\n34\n00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.560\nSo, you're gonna have to find\nanother way to get into the system.\n\n35\n00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.070\nAnd that is either doing what we're going\nto be doing here or some other means.\n\n36\n00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.740\nBut essentially, you're going after\nthe client targeting that and\n\n37\n00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.300\ntargeting the client to get in and\ndo mischief there.\n\n38\n00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.860\nSo getting vulnerabilities irrigating\na soft target, because realistically,\n\n39\n00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.010\na server, which we were doing\na lot of in metasploit,\n\n40\n00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.520\nthose are going to be hardened target.\n\n41\n00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.980\nAnd all the maintenance they're doing,\nthey've closed a lot of the holes.\n\n42\n00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.440\nWe have to find another way to get in.\n\n43\n00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.296\nAnd this could be one of the ways that\nyou get in is hooking the browser.\n\n44\n00:02:17.296 --> 00:02:19.700\n>> So all we have to do is\nget them to visit a webpage.\n\n45\n00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.917\n>> Exactly that's it.\n\n46\n00:02:21.917 --> 00:02:24.450\nYou just have to get them\nto visit the webpage.\n\n47\n00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.130\nAnd once they visit that webpage\n\n48\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.050\nit's a matter of you just deciding\nwhat you're going to do at that point.\n\n49\n00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.340\nSo, you've got a lot of capabilities\nhere once you've got them hooked.\n\n50\n00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.350\nThe cool thing about this is, is when\nyou've got them hooked at a website,\n\n51\n00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.870\nit's completely transparent to them.\n\n52\n00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.900\nThey don't know this\nis actually happening.\n\n53\n00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.268\nThey don't know that someone has,\nis observing them.\n\n54\n00:02:46.268 --> 00:02:49.267\nBasically what we're doing\nis we're proxying stuff,\n\n55\n00:02:49.267 --> 00:02:52.660\nkinda through our own stuff and\ncapturing their information.\n\n56\n00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.590\nThey don't know any of this\nstuff is happening whatsoever.\n\n57\n00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.530\nThey just know that they're going to\nthe website and viewing stuff and\n\n58\n00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.840\ndoing all that jazz and all of the sudden,\nthey've got some whatever on their screen.\n\n59\n00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.530\nThey don't know that we're viewing that,\nmanipulating that and\n\n60\n00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.410\nbringing stuff against them, so\nit's some really cool stuff.\n\n61\n00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.772\n>> Nice.\nSo, what I have done to illustrate this\n\n62\n00:03:13.772 --> 00:03:19.138\nwhole thing is I have brought up\non my screen, this is, I've used\n\n63\n00:03:19.138 --> 00:03:25.605\na couple demo pages that BeEF has made\navailable to us just to make things easy.\n\n64\n00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:29.303\nI'm not trying to give\na whole lesson on this tool,\n\n65\n00:03:29.303 --> 00:03:33.960\nI'm just trying to show you\nthe capabilities of this tool here.\n\n66\n00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.010\nWhat I have is I have a simple demo page.\n\n67\n00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.000\nI had someone presumingly just kind\nof vision someone in the real world\n\n68\n00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.180\nhas browsed in this location, clicked\non the link and they got on this page.\n\n69\n00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.700\nI know the page is not so exciting but,\n\n70\n00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.350\nthat does not matter for\nthis, but we'll get there.\n\n71\n00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.840\nSo someone that browser into it.\n\n72\n00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.990\nSo I've got one browser open over here.\n\n73\n00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.590\nAnd I have another browser open over here.\n\n74\n00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.760\nThis is my actual BeEF control panel.\n\n75\n00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.160\nYou can see that someone and this case\nit's on the same system so it's me.\n\n76\n00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.200\nI've opened up another browser and\ngone to that demo website.\n\n77\n00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.720\nAnd I can see my browser\nsitting right there.\n\n78\n00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.730\nThere's my browser being open.\n\n79\n00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.350\nIf I click on that, you can see it and\nbrings up information about that browser.\n\n80\n00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.125\nAgain, there's strange going on here,\nI just browsed right in.\n\n81\n00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:29.160\nThere' s nothing, there's no funny\nbusiness or anything going on.\n\n82\n00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.926\nI could easily go through and\n\n83\n00:04:31.926 --> 00:04:37.687\ndo one of these deals an open up yet\nanother browser window,\n\n84\n00:04:37.687 --> 00:04:42.890\npop that in, and hit Enter,\nand does the same thing.\n\n85\n00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.920\nSo that's the actual deal.\n\n86\n00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.170\nSo I've got the web browser on there.\n\n87\n00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.860\nWhen I look over and click on Details,\nand so I double click on the browser and\n\n88\n00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.640\nit brings up this Details section.\n\n89\n00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.450\nThis detail section tells me about\nthis specific client that came in.\n\n90\n00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.120\nSo, I have for example the browser\nopen our first category\n\n91\n00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.140\nthat tells us about you know that specific\nwhat they call agent at this level.\n\n92\n00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.990\nYeah, so you see browser than\nyou see user agent string.\n\n93\n00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.940\nSo it's identifying itself.\n\n94\n00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.027\nSo see browser says unknown, but when we\ngo below that it says Mozilla 5, and then\n\n95\n00:05:16.027 --> 00:05:20.140\nit has some stuff underneath that it kind\nof identifies and associates with that.\n\n96\n00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.050\nYou know, and then you get some\ninformation about platform.\n\n97\n00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.690\nThere's some plug-ing information,\nthe size of the window.\n\n98\n00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:26.375\nThat's kind of interesting.\n\n99\n00:05:26.375 --> 00:05:27.112\nYou know?\n[LAUGH] You know,\n\n100\n00:05:27.112 --> 00:05:29.417\nwhat they have it scaled,\nwhat they have it scaled as and\n\n101\n00:05:29.417 --> 00:05:32.381\nthen we just kind of go through and\nyou can see what plug-ins they have.\n\n102\n00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:33.299\nSo these browser components.\n\n103\n00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:34.204\nThese are plug-ins.\n\n104\n00:05:34.204 --> 00:05:38.314\nThis system, or this browser when it came\nto this site actually immediately told me\n\n105\n00:05:38.314 --> 00:05:40.250\nwhat plug-ins it was running.\n\n106\n00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.790\nNo fancy stuff whatsoever,\nit just said hey,\n\n107\n00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:49.790\nthese are the plug-ins I support, and that\nway I can run different types of content.\n\n108\n00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.240\nSo I've identified that and\nyou can see that says Flash is running,\n\n109\n00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.640\nweb sockets is available, WebRTC Session\ncookies and persistent cookies,\n\n110\n00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.170\nthey're all there and available, and\nwe can push content off to them.\n\n111\n00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.890\nSo that's something that would be\nfiled away, for later use, but\n\n112\n00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.140\nwe do have information there.\n\n113\n00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.380\nWhat we see when we look at\nthis hooked page section,\n\n114\n00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.470\nwe see the hooked page information.\n\n115\n00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.690\nThere's the title of it which we could\nvery quickly go over here and say yeah,\n\n116\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.460\nit says BeEF Basic Demo.\n\n117\n00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.080\nI go over here and what does it say?\n\n118\n00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.022\nBeEF Basic Demo.\n\n119\n00:06:27.022 --> 00:06:30.180\nIt has the IP address at\nwhere it's coming from.\n\n120\n00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.830\nThere's cookie information being sent and\n\n121\n00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.570\nthen you can see below this,\nsome additional information.\n\n122\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.350\nSo, we've got quite a bit,\nit's kind of spilling it's guts for us.\n\n123\n00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.110\nBut we're not really done.\n\n124\n00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.580\nWe go over here we look at the top\nlevel logs, you know look at the logs.\n\n125\n00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.926\nThat's the stuff that\nthis person was doing.\n\n126\n00:06:45.926 --> 00:06:50.597\nI did some little stuff here, I browsed to\nthe page and then clicked on the link and\n\n127\n00:06:50.597 --> 00:06:53.140\nthen browsed back and did some stuff.\n\n128\n00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:58.450\nIt's telling me about that but if you look\nreally closely at this, you can see that,\n\n129\n00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.750\nlike right here it says mouse click.\n\n130\n00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:07.380\nAnd it's telling me the exact coordinates\non the screen where I had clicked.\n\n131\n00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.600\nAnd it's telling me some other\ninformation right on through.\n\n132\n00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.260\nWho's got the focus, there's the browser,\nit got hooked right there.\n\n133\n00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.610\nIt didn't get hooked right there,\nI ran an actual command and\n\n134\n00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.400\nI'm gonna show you how\nto do that in a second.\n\n135\n00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.950\nBut we see all these things going on.\n\n136\n00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:29.160\nOkay, but let's go back over to\nlooking at the browser specifically.\n\n137\n00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.260\nSo, I look at the log for the browser and\nnotice there's a log up here.\n\n138\n00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.300\nLook at the log for the browser.\n\n139\n00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.190\nThere's a lot of stuff happening there.\n\n140\n00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.970\nBut let's try something here for a second.\n\n141\n00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:45.580\nSo I'm gonna bring up this basic demo and\nsay, okay well, there's a field on this.\n\n142\n00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.280\nLike we would have on a lot of pages.\n\n143\n00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:54.520\nSo let's type something in\nsaying this is some sample text.\n\n144\n00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.450\nAnd I'll just go ahead and\nhit enter on that.\n\n145\n00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:04.400\nLet's go over and see what happened\nover here with BeEF, if anything.\n\n146\n00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:10.820\nSo when we go through and we look at this,\nwe poke through on this just a bit.\n\n147\n00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.880\nLet's refresh,\nyou will see it will pop up in there.\n\n148\n00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:19.280\nIt'll say, let's look at my logs up here,\nit will say that it popped up.\n\n149\n00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.830\nWell it hasn't shown up yet,\nbut it will show up.\n\n150\n00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.120\nYou can see some stuff\nthat I typed earlier,\n\n151\n00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.340\nyou can see it said user typed test.\n\n152\n00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:31.150\nYou know, that was what I had there\nwhen I came in and I cleared it out.\n\n153\n00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.790\nBut I went ahead and hit Enter on that and\nit came right on over and said,\n\n154\n00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:35.520\nhere you go.\n\n155\n00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.000\nSo you typed in this actual text here,\n\n156\n00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.160\nand it's eventually going\nto show up over here.\n\n157\n00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.450\nIt'll take a moment or two to refresh.\n\n158\n00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:48.460\nSometimes you can just go up here and\njust hit refresh, and it will pop up.\n\n159\n00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.350\nLet me see if I can, you know, get it\nto show up here a little quicker for\n\n160\n00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.470\nus instead of just waiting for\na few moments here.\n\n161\n00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:00.040\nSo, I see it in here.\n\n162\n00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:06.262\nWell, not quite yet but whatever,\nyou got the idea on that,\n\n163\n00:09:06.262 --> 00:09:10.277\nwhere it's showing up because I put\nsome stuff in there previously.\n\n164\n00:09:10.277 --> 00:09:13.260\nSo there's that.\n\n165\n00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.720\nThat's kind of neat we're actually\n\n166\n00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.190\ntracking where things\nare happening in the browser.\n\n167\n00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:22.250\nKind of what's going on, but\nwe've got additional things we can do.\n\n168\n00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.230\nIf we go over here to commands and\nthis is really where, for\n\n169\n00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.200\nus at least with what this\ninitial kind of a move into this.\n\n170\n00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.720\nThis is where kind of some of\nthe really neat stuff happens on it.\n\n171\n00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:40.350\nIs that if I go over here and I open up,\nfor example, this browser section,\n\n172\n00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:46.700\nwhat's happening here, what's with all\nthese things, green, white, or red?\n\n173\n00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:52.530\nWell, it's telling me that those are all\nthings that that browser's vulnerable to.\n\n174\n00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.920\nIt's immediately vulnerable to that.\n\n175\n00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.730\nSo what did it do?\n\n176\n00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.790\nIt detect fox it reader\nit went after that.\n\n177\n00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.710\nSaid there's that.\n\n178\n00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.230\nIt detects vulnerability to that there.\n\n179\n00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.320\nPotential vulnerability to that there.\n\n180\n00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.940\nIt's picked up that there's\ntoolbars in that environment.\n\n181\n00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:12.850\nOr picks up that there's ability to see\nwhat toolbars are in that environment and\n\n182\n00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:19.310\nwe can just go right on down the list and\nsee which ones are of interest to us.\n\n183\n00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:22.550\nIf we find something of interest, we wanna\nrun it, we wanna say detect toolbars,\n\n184\n00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.780\nyou just go over here at Execute.\n\n185\n00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:29.680\nAnd when this person's browsing around,\nit will eventually run that script against\n\n186\n00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.080\nthem and it will spit it back to us\ntelling us, hey, this is what we found.\n\n187\n00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.540\nAnd it's not just browser stuff,\nit's other stuff, too.\n\n188\n00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.570\nI mean, there's stuff specifically for\nChrome.\n\n189\n00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:43.270\nWe're not running Chrome, so we would\nexpect it all to come in red there.\n\n190\n00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:48.210\nOther things we have, this would be\ngreat for people doing web applications,\n\n191\n00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.830\ndebug information.\n\n192\n00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.120\nThere's some additional\nexploits it has available.\n\n193\n00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.760\nAnd there's a huge number of exploits\nhere when we get down to it.\n\n194\n00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.400\nSo there's a lot and\nthen even if we go down the list\n\n195\n00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.850\nI mean who may go look who decided\nto show up, we got metasploit here.\n\n196\n00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.360\nMetasploit in this case doesn't\nhave anything it can even use or\n\n197\n00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.660\ndeploy against this, so it doesn't bring\nanything in this specific case but\n\n198\n00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.740\nit can show up in some cases.\n\n199\n00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.490\nIt's plugging into all this other stuff.\n\n200\n00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.320\nAnd then I like when you\ngo down here to the bottom,\n\n201\n00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.130\nit even has This social engineering\npart of it that will check for\n\n202\n00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:29.350\npotential social engineering\nvulnerabilities.\n\n203\n00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:34.760\nSo you can see here it's got\nthe ability to go through and\n\n204\n00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.100\nfake, oh look, this fake Flash update.\n\n205\n00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.540\nIf you were vulnerable to that, it can\nactually pop something up there and make\n\n206\n00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.990\nit look like that and you can push code\nonto someone's system when they do that.\n\n207\n00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:47.700\nSo you've got other things in there,\nfake notification bars, phishing stuff.\n\n208\n00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.882\nTab naving.\n\n209\n00:11:50.882 --> 00:11:54.248\nThat's a weird name.\n\n210\n00:11:54.248 --> 00:11:54.932\n>> Right?\n\n211\n00:11:54.932 --> 00:11:56.628\nI guess same with tabs I have open.\n\n212\n00:11:56.628 --> 00:11:57.905\nAll these multi-tab browsers.\n\n213\n00:11:57.905 --> 00:11:59.832\n[LAUGH]\n>> It could be that.\n\n214\n00:11:59.832 --> 00:12:02.003\nI can't remember off the top\nof my head what to do.\n\n215\n00:12:02.003 --> 00:12:03.362\nI don't hear that term all that much.\n\n216\n00:12:03.362 --> 00:12:07.204\nAnd then you see this one,\nthe steal auto complete.\n\n217\n00:12:07.204 --> 00:12:12.789\nYou take a look up there, it steals\nauto complete values from Firefox.\n\n218\n00:12:12.789 --> 00:12:17.625\n[LAUGH] So the person goes in there and\nstarts moving around this thing, and\n\n219\n00:12:17.625 --> 00:12:22.920\nstarts hitting the right keys, it will\nactually extract stuff out of there.\n\n220\n00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.230\nThose drop down lists that show up?\n\n221\n00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:28.170\nAs soon as they make that\ndrop down list pop up,\n\n222\n00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.390\nit's extracting stuff out of that\nprotect storage to display it to him.\n\n223\n00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:35.358\nSo this will go ahead once you've\nactivated that and extracted out of it,\n\n224\n00:12:35.358 --> 00:12:38.494\nit'll have the ability to read that and\nsend it back to me.\n\n225\n00:12:38.494 --> 00:12:41.346\nI like how they put in here,\nthis is something for you,\n\n226\n00:12:41.346 --> 00:12:43.649\nyou know, you old school gamers, in here.\n\n227\n00:12:43.649 --> 00:12:45.889\nIt says try convincing the user to enter.\n\n228\n00:12:45.889 --> 00:12:49.663\nUp, up, down, down, left,\nright, left, right, b, a, enter.\n\n229\n00:12:49.663 --> 00:12:50.382\nYeah, so.\n\n230\n00:12:50.382 --> 00:12:54.446\n[LAUGH] There's people out there\ngoing I now get what he's saying.\n\n231\n00:12:54.446 --> 00:13:01.772\nSo they're just trying to say,\nget someone to do this.\n\n232\n00:13:01.772 --> 00:13:04.350\nAnd you can even put\nsomething on their system.\n\n233\n00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:05.313\nI mean, take a look at this.\n\n234\n00:13:05.313 --> 00:13:10.663\nYou can get them to say here's the value\nof that field, you can tell them,\n\n235\n00:13:10.663 --> 00:13:15.170\nhey, if that's on that form I\nwant to grab that information.\n\n236\n00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.380\nSo it's got a lot of stuff\nit can do even there and\n\n237\n00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:24.370\nthen there's even more stuff way beyond\nthis, if you dig through this and\n\n238\n00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:30.600\nreally start getting down to kind of\na brass tax as they sometimes say on here.\n\n239\n00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.140\nYou can see, and I'll just kinda\nopen up some more of this on here.\n\n240\n00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.250\nThis is one that's of interest,\ncross-site scripting.\n\n241\n00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.040\nIt has the ability to\ndo that right in here.\n\n242\n00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.555\nSo this place, this one didn't say if\nthere's any particular vulnerability to\n\n243\n00:13:44.555 --> 00:13:49.520\ncross-site scripting, which I wouldn't\nexpect to see at a demo site like this.\n\n244\n00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.040\nBut, you could very well have that.\n\n245\n00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.990\nIn which case, it would say,\n\n246\n00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:57.880\nokay I see some potential cross\nsite scripting problems showing up.\n\n247\n00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.260\nNow, I have that demo page.\n\n248\n00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.720\nYou saw it, I'll go over to this one.\n\n249\n00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.900\nI had that demo page and I'll say,\nwell, let me go over and\n\n250\n00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:09.770\nclick on this project homepage, you know,\nI can kind of move around and do stuff,\n\n251\n00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.240\nopen up a project homepage.\n\n252\n00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.110\nI mean there's another demo\npage here that's got some,\n\n253\n00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:20.970\nI guess this is their online shopping\nstuff, or it's a fan page for beef.\n\n254\n00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:25.330\nI don't know.\nThe actual beef, as in the meat.\n\n255\n00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.140\nYou got that.\n\n256\n00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.200\nThis person is browsing around.\n\n257\n00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.380\nWhat's happening when you look at\nthe logs we're actually seeing that they\n\n258\n00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:37.890\nare definitely browsing around and\nmoving and doing stuff.\n\n259\n00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:42.190\nAnd there we go, by the way,\nwhen I went to a new page.\n\n260\n00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.870\nIt did the refresh.\n\n261\n00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:49.660\nIt was collecting the data when I moved\nto another page it went ahead and\n\n262\n00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.740\nexecuted that.\n\n263\n00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.860\nAnd so\nnow it's saying this is some sample.\n\n264\n00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:58.210\nAnd since I hit Enter too early\nit has it on two separate things.\n\n265\n00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.350\nSo this some sample text as XT up here.\n\n266\n00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:02.680\nSo I can see some additional stuff.\n\n267\n00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.530\nThere's some blank stuff and then say,\nbrowser window's lost focus,\n\n268\n00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.420\nmove to another page, so it popped over.\n\n269\n00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.420\nSo you're seeing right away, well actually\nthis browser window losing focus,\n\n270\n00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.980\nthat means I moved over to\nthis BeEF control window.\n\n271\n00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.840\nI moved away from that over to this.\n\n272\n00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:24.260\nSo, right there you're really tracking\nquite a bit of what this user's doing\n\n273\n00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.210\nat this point, and you just could start\nrunning other commands against them and\n\n274\n00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:31.593\nsee if that's something that is\ngoing to get you any mileage.\n\n275\n00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.280\nIt's amazing just how much\nyou can do with this,\n\n276\n00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:39.359\nI like the fact that it will find\na vulnerability in something like\n\n277\n00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:46.280\nflash and it'll say, yeah this person, the\nversion of flash their reporting to me,\n\n278\n00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.330\nI know it's present,\nI know what version it is.\n\n279\n00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.865\nAnd I know from what it\nalready has on file that it\n\n280\n00:15:51.865 --> 00:15:54.720\nsays,yeah there is a vulnerability,\na potential vulnerability there.\n\n281\n00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.980\nSo you can go down this list and\n\n282\n00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.540\nchoose the, the vulnerability\nyou want to run against that.\n\n283\n00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.980\nAnd it even tells you\nwith something like this,\n\n284\n00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:06.190\nit tells you, hey these vulnerabilities,\nthese are the ones that are going to run.\n\n285\n00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:10.120\nPretty sure those ones aren't going to,\nyou know you're free to try them but it's\n\n286\n00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.820\nsaying these ones in green, these ones\nI'm pretty sure they're going to run or\n\n287\n00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.940\nthey have the best chance of succeeding so\nyou don't even have to go through and\n\n288\n00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.460\nreally put that much of a thought into it.\n\n289\n00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.020\nYou could go to that part of the list and\n\n290\n00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.750\nsay okay which one of\nthese do I want to run.\n\n291\n00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:25.820\nI know these ones are the ones\nI'm going to be golden on,\n\n292\n00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.240\nI'll just choose from that shorter list.\n\n293\n00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.860\nI won't worry about these ones down here.\n\n294\n00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:29.730\n>> Nice, very nice.\n\n295\n00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.283\n>> And so you can go pretty far with this.\n\n296\n00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:34.583\nReally, really far with this.\n\n297\n00:16:34.583 --> 00:16:38.725\nIt's just kind of a really kind\nof I may use that term a lot,\n\n298\n00:16:38.725 --> 00:16:44.405\nabout saying something is mind numbing,\nbut that's kind of really what it is.\n\n299\n00:16:44.405 --> 00:16:48.370\nNow, it does have some other stuff over\nhere, and I won't worry about this here.\n\n300\n00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.190\nIt takes a lot more setup to do.\n\n301\n00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.080\nBut it does have additional\nstuff it can do.\n\n302\n00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:56.531\nIn fact, this writer stuff over here,\nforging a request and doing a proxy It\n\n303\n00:16:56.531 --> 00:17:00.566\nactually has the ability to do some\nof that stuff the burp suite does,\n\n304\n00:17:00.566 --> 00:17:05.369\nit can actually intercept request back and\nforth from the browser to the web server\n\n305\n00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:07.897\nand back so\nit can step in at that level too.\n\n306\n00:17:07.897 --> 00:17:12.638\nYeah so it's got some pretty cool stuff,\nand just the fact that if you've got this\n\n307\n00:17:12.638 --> 00:17:16.002\nset up in such a way that,\nwell, that's the way it works,\n\n308\n00:17:16.002 --> 00:17:20.832\nis that someone goes to that web page, and\nall of a sudden they're going to get hit.\n\n309\n00:17:20.832 --> 00:17:22.469\nAnd they're not gonna know it.\n\n310\n00:17:22.469 --> 00:17:25.291\nAnd you've got that,\nthat's completely silent.\n\n311\n00:17:25.291 --> 00:17:28.866\nI mean, you never saw me do anything\non these pages that would reveal\n\n312\n00:17:28.866 --> 00:17:33.069\nthe fact that, or nothing showed up in\nthese pages saying that heck, you know,\n\n313\n00:17:33.069 --> 00:17:35.412\nsomeone in the backend\nis messing with you.\n\n314\n00:17:35.412 --> 00:17:38.160\nNo, nothing popped up anywhere.\n\n315\n00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.760\nIt was something that just\nall the sudden popped up\n\n316\n00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:47.260\nin my control panel and beef and\nsaid you've got someone hooked.\n\n317\n00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.580\nAnd then I just start browser for\ninformation.\n\n318\n00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.020\nThey're going around the site and they\ncould be going from page to page to page\n\n319\n00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.350\nand I can just be running\nexploits against them.\n\n320\n00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.270\nAs they hop around,\nthose exploits are running.\n\n321\n00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.059\nEvery time they reload a page,\nor something, or do a refresh,\n\n322\n00:18:01.059 --> 00:18:03.744\nor whatever, it's gonna start\nsticking code in there, and\n\n323\n00:18:03.744 --> 00:18:05.922\nit's gonna start feeding\nit out to the browser.\n\n324\n00:18:05.922 --> 00:18:10.056\nAnd, so you could figure out how easy\nit would be to compromise the system at\n\n325\n00:18:10.056 --> 00:18:10.786\nthat point.\n\n326\n00:18:10.786 --> 00:18:12.028\n>> Very good.\n\n327\n00:18:12.028 --> 00:18:13.863\nAll right,\nwell that's a pretty good look at BeEF.\n\n328\n00:18:13.863 --> 00:18:16.080\nAnything else we wanna\ntake a look at in there?\n\n329\n00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.884\n>> No I mean I think that kind of\ngives you a nice, I wanna say a good\n\n330\n00:18:19.884 --> 00:18:24.798\ntaste of BeEF but that's probably not\nthe best way to phrase it, but whatever.\n\n331\n00:18:24.798 --> 00:18:27.386\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It gives you kind of\n\n332\n00:18:27.386 --> 00:18:31.555\na good idea of what BeEF\nis kind of capable of.\n\n333\n00:18:31.555 --> 00:18:37.710\nThere's plenty more inside\nthat particular tool set.\n\n334\n00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.190\nBut, that just kind of gives\nyou an idea of what it,\n\n335\n00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:41.950\nof kind of the area it's\ncapable of handling.\n\n336\n00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:44.820\nThis will be something that's\nideally suited toward someone\n\n337\n00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.300\nthat's evaluating websites and\nweb applications.\n\n338\n00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.770\nBut then also secure on\nthe client's side too.\n\n339\n00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:54.290\nRemember, the client is the actual\nsoft spot in a lot of places.\n\n340\n00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.103\nYou can get those remote shells anymore,\nso\n\n341\n00:18:56.103 --> 00:18:58.898\nIf I can't get the remote shell on\nthe server, what am I going to do?\n\n342\n00:18:58.898 --> 00:19:03.318\nI'm going to go after the client, inject\nstuff like I did here with this, and\n\n343\n00:19:03.318 --> 00:19:08.010\nget them to get compromised, and then once\nthey're compromised I can start doing\n\n344\n00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:12.568\nthings like putting other stuff on there\nto steal credentials and other stuff.\n\n345\n00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:13.171\n>> All right.\n\n346\n00:19:13.171 --> 00:19:15.342\nWell ladies and\ngentleman I hope you enjoyed that one.\n\n347\n00:19:15.342 --> 00:19:17.641\nStay tuned for more how-to's, coming soon.\n\n348\n00:19:17.641 --> 00:19:22.600\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:14.750\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\nsome web application scanners.\n\n4\n00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.280\nSo, Sean, things that we can use\nto scan web applications, right?\n\n5\n00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.290\nProbably where we're headed, but\nspecifically to look for vulnerabilities?\n\n6\n00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.890\n>> Yeah, these are tools that\nare designed to both help you look for\n\n7\n00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.450\nvulnerabilities as well as\nget more information about\n\n8\n00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.070\nthat application itself, or\nat least that environment.\n\n9\n00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.480\nThere may not necessarily always be a web\napplication back there, that's what these\n\n10\n00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.140\ntools, they help you determine is that\nyou think there's one back there so\n\n11\n00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.820\nyou're doing a little further\ninvestigation and you may get to the point\n\n12\n00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.310\nwhere the next thing you use is something\nlike b for something like burpsuite or\n\n13\n00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.320\nsomething like to start analyzing it\neven further beyond this to see what\n\n14\n00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.860\nyour course of action's gonna be from\nthat point forward So we're kind of\n\n15\n00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.350\nlooking at some tools to help us make that\ndetermination what our next step would be,\n\n16\n00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.720\nin this case we know we have a web server,\nthe question is what else is there?\n\n17\n00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.430\nSo, we're gonna take a look at that by\nreally taking a look at four different\n\n18\n00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.460\ntools that can both help us figure out\nif we have a web application back there,\n\n19\n00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.400\nand the other two are going to give\nus some additional options as far\n\n20\n00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.470\nas messing with the input going\nover to a web application, and\n\n21\n00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.480\nseeing what it can take and seeing if we\ncan get any additional stuff out of it.\n\n22\n00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:42.200\nSo the first thing I'm going to point\nout here is something called URL snarf.\n\n23\n00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.580\nURL snarf is a utility that's\nused to look at your web traffic.\n\n24\n00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.840\nThat's all it does.\n\n25\n00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.290\nIn fact, I'll just hit enter\nhere to kind of let it run.\n\n26\n00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.230\nAll this thing does is right now it's\njust sitting out there listening for\n\n27\n00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.140\ntraffic at random.\n\n28\n00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.940\nAnd it's looking for web traffic\nspecifically but what I can do to tighten\n\n29\n00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.210\nthis up there, is I can tell it here\nis URL snarf dash i space eth zero.\n\n30\n00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.160\nThat's telling it just to listen\non that one specific interface,\n\n31\n00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.085\nwhich happens to be the only interface\nthat I have, which is Is why\n\n32\n00:02:19.085 --> 00:02:23.125\nURL snarf with no arguments worked\nin the first one so what I'm going\n\n33\n00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:26.125\nto do here is I hit enter and you can\nsee it's sitting there just waiting.\n\n34\n00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:30.515\nSo what would happen is if I'm\ndoing my browsing around and\n\n35\n00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:35.205\ndoing my business on this system,\nanything that's travelling back and\n\n36\n00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:38.560\nforth you know it would\nstart telling me about it.\n\n37\n00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.280\nSo if I went up, I brought up this,\nI brought up a gaming website here,\n\n38\n00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.560\njust something at random.\n\n39\n00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.500\nSo I can, this is Nintendo's website,\nso I'm just gonna go ahead over here and\n\n40\n00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.225\nstart clicking around, pushing some\nbuttons, and doing these types of things.\n\n41\n00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:57.990\nAnd just doing normal\ninteractions with the site.\n\n42\n00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.850\nThere may be links on here that I want\nto click and have it open up more stuff.\n\n43\n00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.070\nAnd why I'm doing this,\n\n44\n00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.190\nI can go back over to,\nI'll close this and go back over to my.\n\n45\n00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.820\nMy window here and so\n\n46\n00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.770\nif I open this up, you'll see that it's\nactually picking up that information.\n\n47\n00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.130\nIt's saying okay, here's what I find.\n\n48\n00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.540\nIt sees the exchange going back and forth\nand so as we see that exchange going back\n\n49\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.520\nand forth, we can see a lot of stuff and\nI'm not gonna decode all this.\n\n50\n00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.830\nI'm not gonna worry about decoding all\nof it, but you can see that it indeed\n\n51\n00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.520\nstarted from the time I ran this,\nopened my browser and started doing stuff,\n\n52\n00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.140\nit started fingerprinting information\nthat was heading back and forth and\n\n53\n00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.280\nback and forth.\n\n54\n00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.379\nAnd, you can see it's stuff\nthat go to JavaScript,\n\n55\n00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.306\nwhen I clicked on those buttons you\ncould see some J.S. stuff on there.\n\n56\n00:03:48.306 --> 00:03:51.682\nYou could see stuff where\nit's swapping graphics out.\n\n57\n00:03:51.682 --> 00:03:55.420\nThat's pretty neat, right there,\nand it's just zeroing in,\n\n58\n00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.370\nit's really a sniffer and\nit's just zeroing in on web traffic, so.\n\n59\n00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.766\nThis is one way of looking at it.\n\n60\n00:04:01.766 --> 00:04:06.880\nI could use URL snarf and then at\nthe end of that pipe it over to a file.\n\n61\n00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.270\nI probably wouldn't leave it this way, I\nprobably would pipe it over to a file, but\n\n62\n00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.008\ncuz we're just doing it as a demo here.\n\n63\n00:04:14.008 --> 00:04:17.360\nThat's URL snarf, that would start\nallowing you when you look through this.\n\n64\n00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.840\nBecause if you look through this you can\nsee get requests and stuff like that.\n\n65\n00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.020\nYou can start getting an idea the more\nyou browser around on that site,\n\n66\n00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.830\nit's going to give you more information.\n\n67\n00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.630\nSo it's worth your while to\njust start clicking around and\n\n68\n00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.270\nbrowsing stuff and\nseeing what you can find\n\n69\n00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.670\njust by going through as a matter\nof due course using that site.\n\n70\n00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.610\nAnd to them what you're doing doesn't look\nany different than anybody else visiting\n\n71\n00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.120\nthat site because that's all you're doing.\n\n72\n00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.690\nYou're visiting the site.\n\n73\n00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.730\nThis tool runs on your side of the fence,\nso they don't see it.\n\n74\n00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.100\nIt analyzed the traffic that's\non your side, not on their side.\n\n75\n00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.770\nSo, there's nothing really being sent up.\n\n76\n00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.082\nAll they're seeing is another someone\nwhatever clicking through their site.\n\n77\n00:04:58.082 --> 00:04:58.784\n>> Okay.\n\n78\n00:04:58.784 --> 00:04:59.920\n>> So that's kind of neat.\n\n79\n00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.820\nNow I will minimize that for\nright now, and\n\n80\n00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.280\nI'm going to show something\nelse called grabber.\n\n81\n00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.796\nGrabber is something that gives\nadditional information about a site.\n\n82\n00:05:11.796 --> 00:05:14.419\nNow I've targeted a URL here that I own.\n\n83\n00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.935\nIt's a self deprecating website.\n\n84\n00:05:17.935 --> 00:05:21.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It says it can't find it.\n\n85\n00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.349\nWhy is it can't find Sean Oriyano sucks?\n\n86\n00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:24.564\nBecause I don't.\n\n87\n00:05:24.564 --> 00:05:26.195\nSo.\n\n88\n00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:27.345\n>> [LAUGH] There you go.\n\n89\n00:05:27.345 --> 00:05:28.989\n>> I told you Kali was a smart tool.\n\n90\n00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:33.564\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You could use another location,\n\n91\n00:05:33.564 --> 00:05:37.340\nlike I can put in something that has more.\n\n92\n00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.256\nIf I put something like\nNintendo's website in there.\n\n93\n00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:42.480\nSomething that's got a little\nmore things happening.\n\n94\n00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.850\nI'll probably get better\nresults with this.\n\n95\n00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.674\nWhat this is gonna do is this is gonna say\nthat it's gonna go through that site and\n\n96\n00:05:49.674 --> 00:05:51.070\nsee what it can find.\n\n97\n00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.518\nIt can spit out the vulnerabilities\nabout the site.\n\n98\n00:05:54.518 --> 00:05:56.910\nIt can start giving information\nabout structure of it.\n\n99\n00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.464\nIt's going to go through different things.\n\n100\n00:05:59.464 --> 00:06:02.950\nIn this case,\nit's actually spidering the site.\n\n101\n00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.586\nWhat I'm doing here by the way, this\nisn't any different than something like\n\n102\n00:06:06.586 --> 00:06:08.640\nGoogle or\nanybody like that would be doing.\n\n103\n00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.280\nSo, no, I'm not hacking their site at all.\n\n104\n00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.465\nThis is all entirely passive.\n\n105\n00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:15.770\nThis is just bringing up stuff\nthat people be doing anyway.\n\n106\n00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.938\nI'm not actually breaking in here.\n\n107\n00:06:17.938 --> 00:06:19.480\nIf you're wondering, didn't you say?\n\n108\n00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.367\nYeah, I said don't use the stuff.\n\n109\n00:06:21.367 --> 00:06:23.870\nAgain, so if you don't have permission.\n\n110\n00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.024\nIn this case,\n\n111\n00:06:25.024 --> 00:06:30.815\nI'm not doing anything that's any\ndifferent from just normal usage.\n\n112\n00:06:30.815 --> 00:06:33.167\nSo it would be okay in this case.\n\n113\n00:06:33.167 --> 00:06:36.886\nNow if I started doing this a lot\nagainst them and causing a lot of\n\n114\n00:06:36.886 --> 00:06:41.602\nunnecessary strain on their site and\nall that, then that would be not allowed.\n\n115\n00:06:41.602 --> 00:06:45.468\nI can get away with it because, is exactly\nwhat search engines do and other stuff do.\n\n116\n00:06:45.468 --> 00:06:50.300\nBut, you can see is actually starting\nto tell me what the site is.\n\n117\n00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.440\nWhen I look at this stuff it's telling me,\nhere's, or some various\n\n118\n00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.910\npieces of the site, it's given me some\nadditional information about directories.\n\n119\n00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.930\nWhat's cool is by doing this you can\nactually start brute forcing the structure\n\n120\n00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:08.110\nof that site, stuff that may not be\nas visible, or may not be necessarily\n\n121\n00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.790\ndeliberately hidden, but\nsomething that's not linked into anything.\n\n122\n00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.530\nSo, this will go do some brute forcing and\ntry to find what it can.\n\n123\n00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.400\nAnd, it will start sitting up links\nsaying hey, here's some stuff, so\n\n124\n00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.060\nit can map out the structure of that\nsite and give you additional things.\n\n125\n00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.355\nI'm pretty sure here they are not\ntrying to hide anything deliberately or\n\n126\n00:07:30.355 --> 00:07:31.607\nanything like that.\n\n127\n00:07:31.607 --> 00:07:36.338\nBut, who knows, the target you're\ngoing after as a pen tester for\n\n128\n00:07:36.338 --> 00:07:40.224\nthem, they may have URLs on\ntheir web server that are,\n\n129\n00:07:40.224 --> 00:07:45.801\neither kind of treated as an out of sight\nout of mind type deal, or its something\n\n130\n00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:51.069\nthat they haven't linked in any place\nbecause they they forgot about it.\n\n131\n00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:52.991\nThat happens,\nthey put files up on a sight and\n\n132\n00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:55.890\ncompletely forgot the fact\nthat they were up there.\n\n133\n00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:00.090\nAnd now you stumble across them,\nand that may be all you need.\n\n134\n00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.560\nIt may have those little\nnuggets of information, or\n\n135\n00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.165\nother stuff to help you to go further.\n\n136\n00:08:05.165 --> 00:08:09.890\nNow the cool thing about this also,\nby the way, because I close out\n\n137\n00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:14.990\nthe other tool in here,\nis when I look at things\n\n138\n00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:20.310\nlike URL Snarf, these things will start\nchattering away, as you're seeing here.\n\n139\n00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:23.870\nSo I close out of it, and\ncoming back over to it,\n\n140\n00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.420\nnotice the other tool is making queries.\n\n141\n00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.757\nThat's what's happening over here.\n\n142\n00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:32.110\nI'm not touching anything,\nit's going and popping through.\n\n143\n00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:36.079\nIts whole process,\nif you take a look at this as well,\n\n144\n00:08:36.079 --> 00:08:41.210\nyou can kinda get an idea because of\nwhat I can do in the other utility.\n\n145\n00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.790\nGrabber's still running, so\nI look over here at URLsnarf, and\n\n146\n00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.660\nyou can get a better idea\nof what Grabber's doing.\n\n147\n00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.010\nGrabber, I said go blahdy blah\nover to Nintendo.com and see,\n\n148\n00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:56.292\nif you could tell me what\nthe structure of the site looks like.\n\n149\n00:08:56.292 --> 00:09:01.244\nSo it dutifully went off and did that, and\nit's spitting stuff back up over there but\n\n150\n00:09:01.244 --> 00:09:04.440\nI look over here and\nyou can see what's going on.\n\n151\n00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.260\nIt's looking at different\nlinks on that site, but\n\n152\n00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:12.090\nit's also, you can see,\nsome Google stuff on the back end there.\n\n153\n00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.769\nSo it's working with Google to\nactually help map out that site.\n\n154\n00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:16.469\nSo it's going through Google as well and\n\n155\n00:09:16.469 --> 00:09:20.700\nthey're working together to give you an\neven better picture of what's happening.\n\n156\n00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.220\nSo that's pretty neat right there,\n\n157\n00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:29.660\nthat it's able to do that on your\nbehalf and give you this information.\n\n158\n00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.802\n>> Absolutely, that's very cool.\n\n159\n00:09:30.802 --> 00:09:35.432\n>> Yeah, it is and if you're someone\nthat's trying to do that break in\n\n160\n00:09:35.432 --> 00:09:40.146\non a site now you're seeing more of\nthat structure revealed to you and\n\n161\n00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:42.827\nI guarantee if you do this long enough,\n\n162\n00:09:42.827 --> 00:09:49.090\nyou're going to find websites that they\nhave hidden away that they forgot about.\n\n163\n00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:53.658\nAnd they forgot about, they have no idea,\nthey have someone left the company that\n\n164\n00:09:53.658 --> 00:09:58.091\nput it there, or they just did so many\nreorganizations on the site and redesigns\n\n165\n00:09:58.091 --> 00:10:02.687\nthat the stuff eventually got orphaned,\nand boom, this goes ahead and finds it.\n\n166\n00:10:02.687 --> 00:10:07.385\nSo kind of a neat thing for you to use.\n\n167\n00:10:07.385 --> 00:10:10.597\nSo we have urlsnarf.\n\n168\n00:10:10.597 --> 00:10:11.460\nWe had Grabber.\n\n169\n00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:15.080\nIt was like I said, it goes out there and\ntried to do some brute forcing for you.\n\n170\n00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.450\nWe do have some other\ntools here that we can\n\n171\n00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:22.080\ndo stuff as far as the web\napplications are concerned.\n\n172\n00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.788\nWe have one called Web Slayer.\n\n173\n00:10:24.788 --> 00:10:30.332\nWeb Slayer is a tool that can help you do\nsome of the stuff that we talked about and\n\n174\n00:10:30.332 --> 00:10:35.456\nanother how to, we talked about using\ntools that can break passwords and\n\n175\n00:10:35.456 --> 00:10:37.220\nhelp look at a site.\n\n176\n00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:42.350\nThat's what this one will do as well,\nyou can actually go to and put in URLs and\n\n177\n00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:47.220\nI could say put in a URL of a website and\nsay okay,\n\n178\n00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.470\ndrop that in, and\nit can run certain things against me.\n\n179\n00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:56.560\nIt's like in this case, I just went\nahead and pumped in google.com.\n\n180\n00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.890\nI didn't expect google.com to come up with\nanything so it's throwing errors, but\n\n181\n00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:05.820\nwhat's happening is if I had put a URL\nin there with an actual form that's got\n\n182\n00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.910\nsome fields in it,\nI could configure it to do fuzzing.\n\n183\n00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:14.080\nWhich means I could choose,\nbasically a dictionary in here.\n\n184\n00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.741\nAnd then tell it, okay,\nwhat type of fuzzing do you want to do?\n\n185\n00:11:17.741 --> 00:11:21.453\nAnd it would actually start trying ranges\nof values based off that dictionary to see\n\n186\n00:11:21.453 --> 00:11:23.980\nwhat happens to an application\nwhen it gets it.\n\n187\n00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:28.630\nAnd you could cause an application\nsome grief if you do that.\n\n188\n00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.620\nYou really could.\n\n189\n00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.620\nApplications respond in really\nweird ways to that type of stuff.\n\n190\n00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.118\nAnd then you can see over here,\nyou can even with the headers,\n\n191\n00:11:38.118 --> 00:11:43.640\nyou can even change, if you're not getting\ntraction using your current browser.\n\n192\n00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.766\nHeck, you can just change\nit to another one.\n\n193\n00:11:45.766 --> 00:11:50.630\nAll you got to do is just change,\nhey you wanna go use the Windows NT 13.1.\n\n194\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.605\nYou wanna go ahead and use that,\nwhatever, it will submit it.\n\n195\n00:11:54.605 --> 00:11:57.600\nIt will identify itself as far\nas that thing is concerned.\n\n196\n00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.789\nMozilla 5,\ncome on they update that every other week.\n\n197\n00:12:01.789 --> 00:12:04.265\nIt's gotta be up to like 250 by now,\nright.\n\n198\n00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:07.437\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you could do those sorts of things,\n\n199\n00:12:07.437 --> 00:12:12.769\nI've even when I know it's my\nfriend that I'm checking something\n\n200\n00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:17.526\nout forum on here,\nI've been known to be kind of a wise guy,\n\n201\n00:12:17.526 --> 00:12:21.240\nand put for\nuser agent I put my name on there.\n\n202\n00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.258\nJust kind of my way of signing their log,\nI'm like Zoro, there you go.\n\n203\n00:12:25.258 --> 00:12:31.170\n[LAUGH] So anyways, not a smart practice\nto do if you're trying to stay hidden,\n\n204\n00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.240\nbut they knew I was coming.\n\n205\n00:12:35.872 --> 00:12:40.759\nAnyways, so here's something also works\nwith a payload generator that you\n\n206\n00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:45.487\ncan also use to brute force a site to see\nhow it reacts you can tell it to hey,\n\n207\n00:12:45.487 --> 00:12:49.709\nhere's certain files I want you\nto try against a site and upload.\n\n208\n00:12:49.709 --> 00:12:54.460\nYou can tell it ranges to try against\ncertain certain things on a site.\n\n209\n00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.118\nJust some really stuff in here.\n\n210\n00:12:56.118 --> 00:12:57.250\nAnd this is what really gets me.\n\n211\n00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.130\nHey, well you want to try some, you want\nto try some, do some credit cards on here?\n\n212\n00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:05.635\nYou can tell and just pop some credit card\nstuff in there and it will test those out.\n\n213\n00:13:05.635 --> 00:13:10.166\n>> [LAUGH] [COUGH] Gonna\ngo on a buying spree.\n\n214\n00:13:10.166 --> 00:13:13.737\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So, you can just pop that in,\n\n215\n00:13:13.737 --> 00:13:15.188\nand there you go.\n\n216\n00:13:15.188 --> 00:13:19.637\nSay I wanna try some Visa stuff, and\nI wanna try this Discover card, and\n\n217\n00:13:19.637 --> 00:13:20.980\nyou just keep going.\n\n218\n00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.386\nBe sure and choose the ones that\nthat site takes what you got up,\n\n219\n00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:26.651\ncome on you gotta have American Express.\n\n220\n00:13:26.651 --> 00:13:27.760\nThey take that everywhere.\n\n221\n00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.384\nSo don't leave home without it man.\n\n222\n00:13:30.384 --> 00:13:31.876\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n223\n00:13:31.876 --> 00:13:35.419\n>> So you could do that,\nI mean there is username stuff and\n\n224\n00:13:35.419 --> 00:13:40.117\nyou can just once you're ready,\nyou could just go ahead and have it crate\n\n225\n00:13:40.117 --> 00:13:44.865\nthat actual payload or that attack,\nand fire it off of the application.\n\n226\n00:13:44.865 --> 00:13:48.198\nE-commerce site, you wanna see how\nit reacts to certain things and\n\n227\n00:13:48.198 --> 00:13:51.473\nhow it does its validation,\nin this case credit card numbers, and\n\n228\n00:13:51.473 --> 00:13:54.123\nyou've got some credit card\nnumbers that are bogus.\n\n229\n00:13:54.123 --> 00:13:57.840\nIt will try them out and see what happens.\n\n230\n00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.962\n>> Hm, very interesting.\n\n231\n00:13:58.962 --> 00:14:00.980\n>> So pretty neat.\n\n232\n00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.403\nIf I start seeing some charges out there.\n\n233\n00:14:03.403 --> 00:14:04.206\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n234\n00:14:04.206 --> 00:14:07.017\n>> Yeah so I'm not gonna go out and\n\n235\n00:14:07.017 --> 00:14:13.410\ndo a live test against that because\none of the

wanna see.\n\n238\n00:14:21.008 --> 00:14:24.420\n[LAUGH] And not the stuff that,\nhey, make sure the kids are in bed.\n\n239\n00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.008\nNo, not that type of stuff.\n\n240\n00:14:26.008 --> 00:14:31.187\nBut, plenty of power in here\nto actually test a website, or\n\n241\n00:14:31.187 --> 00:14:37.760\nin this case, this actually really\nis a web application at this point.\n\n242\n00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.977\nOnce I get to a point where I\ncan start doing fuzzing and\n\n243\n00:14:40.977 --> 00:14:44.841\nstart dropping credit cards and\nprocessing that type of stuff,\n\n244\n00:14:44.841 --> 00:14:49.440\nyou're way beyond just a simple web\nserver, website at that point rather.\n\n245\n00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.460\n>> Yeah.\n>> So you've gone way beyond that.\n\n246\n00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:57.277\nSo, pretty neat tool,\nWebSlayer, as far as that goes.\n\n247\n00:14:57.277 --> 00:15:02.825\nAnd then one other one,\njust to kinda quickly mention out here,\n\n248\n00:15:02.825 --> 00:15:08.406\nis one called OWASP DirBuster,\nDirBuster sounds kinda weird.\n\n249\n00:15:08.406 --> 00:15:10.271\nIt's DirBuster, man.\n\n250\n00:15:10.271 --> 00:15:11.577\n>> [LAUGH] Directory,\nis that what this is for?\n\n251\n00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:14.623\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] So you've got that,\n\n252\n00:15:14.623 --> 00:15:18.335\nyou can just drop in your URL in here and\n\n253\n00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:22.990\nit can try to see what it\nfinds at that location.\n\n254\n00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:27.520\nSo if I type in a URL for\nmy site for example.\n\n255\n00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.860\nI can just pop it in.\n\n256\n00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.200\nIt's like whoops I didn't' put\nmy URL in the right format.\n\n257\n00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.050\nBut I can just pop this\n\n258\n00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:40.480\nmy URL in and, you can just go ahead\npresumably if it's a valid on,\n\n259\n00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.570\nit'll go ahead and run the stuff.\n\n260\n00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:50.216\nI don't expect it to find really anything\nin this site that's gonna be of use.\n\n261\n00:15:50.216 --> 00:15:53.300\nI purposely don't put that\ntype of stuff up there.\n\n262\n00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:59.326\nBut if you had a web application that\nhad a web site underneath it that had\n\n263\n00:15:59.326 --> 00:16:02.212\na lot of stuff coming out of it tentacles.\n\n264\n00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:05.704\nI say this could be something\nthat could really get in and\n\n265\n00:16:05.704 --> 00:16:09.130\ntry to find those different\npieces of it as well.\n\n266\n00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.704\nSo this would be useful for\nreally kind of mapping out a site and\n\n267\n00:16:12.704 --> 00:16:17.061\neven in this case looking for different\ntypes of files and stuff like that.\n\n268\n00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:21.601\nYeah so, kind of another neat\nthing out there as well so\n\n269\n00:16:21.601 --> 00:16:28.520\nthere's just four tools out there that\nyou can do some of these checks with.\n\n270\n00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.487\nThere's plenty more out there.\n\n271\n00:16:30.487 --> 00:16:34.586\nEach one of the features in here I can\neven say for any of these products\n\n272\n00:16:34.586 --> 00:16:39.820\nthey have, there's stuff that\nspecializes in every one of those areas.\n\n273\n00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.975\nFuzzing is another one that's got, there's\na whole class of tools there for fuzzing.\n\n274\n00:16:43.975 --> 00:16:49.812\nAnd you can use those to test a whole\nbroad range of applications with that.\n\n275\n00:16:49.812 --> 00:16:53.940\nThey have fuzzers for\njust regular server based applications.\n\n276\n00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:58.380\nAnd they have a lot of them for\nweb based stuff to see how they react.\n\n277\n00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.150\nSo you can go down that road for\npassword crackers.\n\n278\n00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.490\nThere's bunches and bunches and\nbunches of password crackers.\n\n279\n00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:09.001\nAs far as the first couple for\nexample with URL snarf,\n\n280\n00:17:09.001 --> 00:17:13.550\nURL snarf, it's just a sniffer, but\n\n281\n00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:17.780\nit's more efficient\nthan running Wireshark.\n\n282\n00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:22.660\nWireshark could do really anything\nthat that utility there could use.\n\n283\n00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:26.370\nIt could very easily pull\noff the same sort of stuff.\n\n284\n00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:29.960\nThe problem is is that Wireshark's\ngot that whole environment around it\n\n285\n00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.580\nthat you have to carry the load\nwith you with all that.\n\n286\n00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.540\nWith URLsnarf, it doesn't claim to do,\nit's not Wireshark,\n\n287\n00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.260\nit doesn't claim to be Wireshark.\n\n288\n00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:44.770\nIt focuses on one thing and one thing only\nand it does that incredibly well, and\n\n289\n00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:46.450\nwhich is to give us all that information.\n\n290\n00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.500\nI mean it's been running back here\nthe whole time so it's still doing its job\n\n291\n00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.470\nwhen things are going ahead and\nrunning and doing its whatever.\n\n292\n00:17:54.470 --> 00:18:00.044\nIt's doing its whole deal back there,\nI think I still have Grabber running,\n\n293\n00:18:00.044 --> 00:18:04.162\nand Grabber looks like it's\nfinished its whole to-do,\n\n294\n00:18:04.162 --> 00:18:09.391\na nice way to bring things back around,\nso, well that's my Sparta one,\n\n295\n00:18:09.391 --> 00:18:14.191\nI left that one up, so I have Grabbers,\nGrabber is still running,\n\n296\n00:18:14.191 --> 00:18:18.880\nit's still mapping stuff out for\nus, and this it's a big site.\n\n297\n00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.117\nI didn't choose a small site.\n\n298\n00:18:21.117 --> 00:18:24.004\nThis is not, I wouldn't expect\nit to be done right away.\n\n299\n00:18:24.004 --> 00:18:25.410\nI was kind of surprised,\nI was like oh, okay.\n\n300\n00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.300\nThat explains why I was\non the wrong window.\n\n301\n00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.300\nThat's what happens when you\nleave a lot of consoles open.\n\n302\n00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.560\nSo I've got, I look here and\nsee it is still going.\n\n303\n00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.130\nIt's something that, okay,\nI'll come back in a bit, and\n\n304\n00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:42.930\nafter it's done all of this and\nsee what the results are.\n\n305\n00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:48.280\nSo there's just some other tools that\nyou could potentially use to get you\n\n306\n00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:53.590\nmore information out of your\ntargets such as they are.\n\n307\n00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.020\n>> Very good.\nAll right,\n\n308\n00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.660\nwell Sean, another great look at some\nof the tools we've got available.\n\n309\n00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.000\nThese in particular looking\nat web applications.\n\n310\n00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.413\nHope you guys enjoyed watching this one.\n\n311\n00:19:02.413 --> 00:19:04.186\nStay tuned for more How Tos.\n\n312\n00:19:04.186 -->

Oriyano\nwith me, and we're gonna be taking a look\n\n4\n00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:16.560\nat some Footprinting Tools, some stuff\nthat we can do some reconnaissance with.\n\n5\n00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.740\nSo Sean, what kind of stuff do\nyou have lined up for us today?\n\n6\n00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.100\n>> Well, I'm gonna show some\ndifferent tools that fit in\n\n7\n00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.620\nthe Footprinting phase and kind of cross\nover a little bit in the next one.\n\n8\n00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.080\nBut, I think they're close enough\nthat they're worth showing.\n\n9\n00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.560\nThe idea here is it's not necessarily\nsomething that's gonna show\n\n10\n00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.120\nyou information that's brand\nnew that it receives, and\n\n11\n00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.180\nwe're just going to show you\ndifferent ways to get it and\n\n12\n00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.940\ndifferent options you have\nto gather this information.\n\n13\n00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.670\nThe thing is that we know,\nI'm going to be using Kali for this.\n\n14\n00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.190\nWe know that Kali has so many different\ntools inside of it that it's a question of\n\n15\n00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.200\nwhich ones you're going to go to for\nyour default tools and\n\n16\n00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.070\nwhich ones you like to\nuse outside of that.\n\n17\n00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.370\nThe trouble with it is, most people Kali,\nthey tend to with any product or\n\n18\n00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.530\nanywhere in life, once you get your\nfavorites, you stay with your favorites.\n\n19\n00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.978\nThey earned that position for whatever\nreason and that's your default ones.\n\n20\n00:01:15.978 --> 00:01:18.270\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And I can understand that but\n\n21\n00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.140\nwith something like pen testing you\nalways wanna have some flexibility so and\n\n22\n00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.710\nI'm a big fan of that.\n\n23\n00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.790\nSo what we're doing here is we're\nshowing you some tools that do some\n\n24\n00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.260\nof the stuff you've already\nseen that other tools do.\n\n25\n00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.380\nBut maybe these will become your favorites\nor maybe these will be something hey,\n\n26\n00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.380\nheck you'll throw them into\nthe pot with everything else and\n\n27\n00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.410\njust one more thing you can use.\n\n28\n00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.650\nSo, with that being said,\n\n29\n00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.262\nwhat we're gonna do is look at how\nto get information from a URL, or\n\n30\n00:01:45.262 --> 00:01:49.990\nspecifically actually an IP address,\nwe're gonna look at a new way to do,\n\n31\n00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.600\nor a different scanner rather, and\njust a couple other things along the way\n\n32\n00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.292\nthat I think you'll find cool,\nhopefully kind of cool and interesting.\n\n33\n00:01:59.292 --> 00:02:02.860\nSo to get started on this,\n\n34\n00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.560\nI've got several of these\ntools up on my screen.\n\n35\n00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.490\nWe've got different options, we have, for\nexample, this is one of the Footprinting\n\n36\n00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.440\ntools I kinda wanted to put out there,\nis one called DNS Map.\n\n37\n00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.260\nWhat this is used for, is this is used for\n\n38\n00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.670\nyou to find sub-domains\nof a particular domain.\n\n39\n00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.750\nSo I can put in my domain like this,\n\n40\n00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.890\nI also have over here,\nI did it ahead of time, to prep us for it.\n\n41\n00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.340\nI did a ping against Microsoft's website.\n\n42\n00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.690\nI could go in here and\nI could put in, well I,\n\n43\n00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.560\nif I wanted to I could put in\nlike a Microsoft.com in here.\n\n44\n00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.250\nAnd there's plenty of options and\nswitches that go with this.\n\n45\n00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.920\nAnd when you hit Enter,\nit's going to start querying that.\n\n46\n00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.940\nAnd it's gonna see if it\ncan find any sub-domains,\n\n47\n00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.640\nand it may take a while with the case of\nsomething like Microsoft which we know has\n\n48\n00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.430\ngot that hydra type thing, you cut off\na head, two more come back you know\n\n49\n00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.540\ntype thing with their domain structure\nbecause they do have quite a bit but\n\n50\n00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.620\nthis can take a while to do it and\nI actually may have to tweak it sometimes.\n\n51\n00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.345\nYou know sometimes it will come back\nwith something that you know should have\n\n52\n00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:18.370\nsub-domains and it says I can't find any.\n\n53\n00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.120\nWell you're gonna probably need to\ntweak your parameters just a bit.\n\n54\n00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.980\nThere may be network congestion.\n\n55\n00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.880\nThere might be something in\nbetween blocking your traffic.\n\n56\n00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.080\nDNS map offers that.\n\n57\n00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.370\nDNS map allows you\nthe ability to query stuff or\n\n58\n00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.250\nchoose the actual DNS server\nyou want to go ahead and use.\n\n59\n00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.080\nSo this is going ahead,\nit's actually looking to see if there\n\n60\n00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.760\nare any sub domains in here,\nit has a built in word list,\n\n61\n00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.540\nwhich means it has its own built in one,\nbut you can define your own.\n\n62\n00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.910\nIf you want to try different\ncombinations of stuff, you know, say,\n\n63\n00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.840\nyou have that type of deal.\n\n64\n00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.150\nSo this one's taking some\ntime like I expected it too.\n\n65\n00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.130\nBut just to show yeah you can find other\nways to find these various subdomains.\n\n66\n00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.850\nWe used netcraft before for this was\na tool that was very suitable for this.\n\n67\n00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.230\nAnd I'm not knocking that one but\n\n68\n00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.000\nthe thing is is that you've got to\nfind other things to try just in case.\n\n69\n00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.860\nIt happens all the time\nthat you get blocked.\n\n70\n00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.070\nYou never know what a client's gonna throw\nat you, so we have another way of doing,\n\n71\n00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.810\nfinding out subdomains and\nstuff like that.\n\n72\n00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.460\nSo we'll let that go ahead and\nrun and see what happens,\n\n73\n00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.470\nif we need to do any adjustments to it or\nif we need to, we can leave it as it is.\n\n74\n00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.245\nYou don't always get the results\nyou want the first time.\n\n75\n00:04:40.245 --> 00:04:43.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we'll let that take its course and\n\n76\n00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.950\nsee what it does.\n\n77\n00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.350\nAll right, so\n\n78\n00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.560\nnext what I want to talk about is just to\ngo through some of these tools in here.\n\n79\n00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.650\nThis is one that, we kinda when we\nwent through these how tos except for\n\n80\n00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.190\nour first couple ones that we did,\nwhich we focused specifically on NMap.\n\n81\n00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.450\nWe didn't really ever see NMap directly,\nfrom that point on.\n\n82\n00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.520\nWe did do scans.\n\n83\n00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.700\nWe knew that NMap was\nsomewhere in the mix doing it,\n\n84\n00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.830\nbut we didn't interact with it directly.\n\n85\n00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.230\nBut, are there other ways to do\nthe same thing that NMap does\n\n86\n00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.740\nand get similar results,\nif not better results.\n\n87\n00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.920\nWell, yeah, there are.\n\n88\n00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.270\nNMap is a very, very good tool.\n\n89\n00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.950\nIt has a tremendous amount of flexibility,\nand\n\n90\n00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.720\nthere's even more power to be unlocked\nthere through its own scripting engine,\n\n91\n00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.330\nas we saw in one of our other how-tos, but\nit's not the end all do all of things.\n\n92\n00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.780\nNMap's become popular mainly because\nof its tremendous flexibility and\n\n93\n00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.830\nthe fact that you do have all that\npower that you can unlock if you wanna\n\n94\n00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.570\nreally kind of take it to town.\n\n95\n00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.450\nWell there are other scanners.\n\n96\n00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.030\nWhen we did our ethical hacking course,\nwe talked about some of those other ones.\n\n97\n00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.770\nOne of them was like Super Scan for\nexample.\n\n98\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.660\nAnd there are plenty other\nones on top of that.\n\n99\n00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.270\nThen we saw, later on, during when we\ndid just Kali, we looked at using Ncat.\n\n100\n00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.980\nWe can use Ncat as a port scanner\nif we really wanted to do that.\n\n101\n00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.540\nBut here, what we're going to use\nis use something called Mass Scan.\n\n102\n00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:19.250\nWhat Mass Scan is that this tool has a\nbenefit of being very fast for what it is.\n\n103\n00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.690\nIt can actually sweep a subnet,\na very large subnet, in a few minutes.\n\n104\n00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.990\nSomething that would take\nNMap a lot longer to do.\n\n105\n00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.900\nAnd that's because, basically,\nthe diet this thing on,\n\n106\n00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.690\nthey made it nice slim and\ntrim and efficient.\n\n107\n00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.900\nThey also got rid of a lot of overhead,\nand\n\n108\n00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.050\non top of all that, they even wrote\nthe Siget's own custom TCPIP stack,\n\n109\n00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.570\nso where you have other tools that use the\nstuff that's in the operating system and\n\n110\n00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.210\nthere are other ones that write their\nown customs stack that's more efficient.\n\n111\n00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.430\nYou don't necessarily always have\nthe choice of which one you use,\n\n112\n00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.530\nthey don't tell you.\n\n113\n00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.190\nThis one, if you take a look at it, the\ndevelopers tell you, hey we wrote our own,\n\n114\n00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.810\nso it acts a little different\nthan normal TCPIP stack, but it's\n\n115\n00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.240\noptimized to do this function and this\nfunction only, and so it's pretty fast.\n\n116\n00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.580\nSo what I've done is I\nput a subnet in there.\n\n117\n00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.470\nThis one, unlike endmap, endmap you can\ntype in endmap at the command line and\n\n118\n00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.220\nput an IP address in and hit enter.\n\n119\n00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.810\nAnd it will say, okay, good.\n\n120\n00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.570\nI'll be back in a bit and\nit will run a default scan.\n\n121\n00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:25.650\nThis one won't do that.\n\n122\n00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.250\nThis one, the command line you see here\nwhere it says dash p and it has the range\n\n123\n00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:35.839\nof ports in there after it and then it has\nmy IP address with a subnet marking on it.\n\n124\n00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.550\nThis one, it will not run if you\njust put a range of IPs in there and\n\n125\n00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.830\ndo not put a port, it'll literally\ncome back with a response saying hey,\n\n126\n00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.581\nwhy don't you try using some port numbers?\n\n127\n00:07:47.581 --> 00:07:50.581\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It's kinda got that attitude\n\n128\n00:07:50.581 --> 00:07:51.243\nwith you.\n\n129\n00:07:51.243 --> 00:07:56.390\nSo you put that in there and so you\ndefine your port numbers and hit enter.\n\n130\n00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:01.110\nAnd it's actually, you know, as far as\nthings go, under the right conditions,\n\n131\n00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.660\nthis thing can smoke.\n\n132\n00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.369\nIt can smoke end map under\nthe same conditions.\n\n133\n00:08:08.369 --> 00:08:13.547\nThey were talking with this one that\nthis one can do under some conditions,\n\n134\n00:08:13.547 --> 00:08:18.230\ncan scan a really, really large\nnumber of hosts in about six minutes\n\n135\n00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.353\nwhich would take Nmap\nway longer than that but\n\n136\n00:08:21.353 --> 00:08:26.638\nNmap has got that benefit of flexibility\nwhere this one doesn't have that.\n\n137\n00:08:26.638 --> 00:08:31.910\nThe cool thing about this, is by the way,\nis that if you look at Mass Scan,\n\n138\n00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.907\nMass Scan is really neat because\nnot only is it fast, but\n\n139\n00:08:35.907 --> 00:08:39.480\nyou would think that if\nyou have a different tool,\n\n140\n00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.733\neven it does the same thing,\nyou've got a different tool,\n\n141\n00:08:43.733 --> 00:08:48.800\nwell that other tool is going to\nhave different ways to use it.\n\n142\n00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.260\nBut it's not doing it the same,\n\n143\n00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.332\nit's not gonna have the same\noptions to activate those things.\n\n144\n00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:58.310\nMass Scan as well as a couple other\nscanners that are built into Kali,\n\n145\n00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.809\nhave the advantage of the fact that\nthey use a lot of the same flags\n\n146\n00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.800\nthat the other technologies use.\n\n147\n00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.887\nSo this one, you'll notice on here,\nit's got options\n\n148\n00:09:12.887 --> 00:09:18.320\nthat you can use saying -ss,\n-pn, -n,- other stuff.\n\n149\n00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.570\nThose first three, that -ss, -pn, -n,\n\n150\n00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:25.830\nthose are all,\nthose are all right from NMap.\n\n151\n00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.860\nThe developers of this were\nreally smart about it.\n\n152\n00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:32.467\nThey made it so someone could very easily\ntake this thing, come over from NMap and\n\n153\n00:09:32.467 --> 00:09:36.149\nsay, oh yeah I can use this, and\nI can be off and running with it.\n\n154\n00:09:36.149 --> 00:09:40.805\nSo, that's kind of a great thing\nthat you don't have to reinvent\n\n155\n00:09:40.805 --> 00:09:45.898\nthe wheel on this and get the whole\ndifferent set of knowledge in there.\n\n156\n00:09:45.898 --> 00:09:50.080\nYou know it's going to happen, it's going\nto conflict, I mean, you guys know the way\n\n157\n00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.087\nit is, you've seen me up here and I'm\ntyping something, I'm typing here in Linux\n\n158\n00:09:54.087 --> 00:09:57.811\nand switch over to Windows and back and\nforth like I put my slash the wrong way,\n\n159\n00:09:57.811 --> 00:10:01.283\nor I left out something, or I used\na command one that wasn't the other.\n\n160\n00:10:01.283 --> 00:10:04.550\nYou know,\na couple of you have noted that too.\n\n161\n00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.919\nEspecially when I did stuff with.\n\n162\n00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:11.121\nYeah you can't use that command there.\n\n163\n00:10:11.121 --> 00:10:14.133\nIt's like yeah I got flipped\nbetween things too fast and\n\n164\n00:10:14.133 --> 00:10:17.440\nI kind of lost my situational\nawareness for a second.\n\n165\n00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.110\nYou know, so.\n\n166\n00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.560\nBut, that one's doing it, scanned.\n\n167\n00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.520\nYou can see it's doing it's deal,\nit's taking, it's kinda, you know,\n\n168\n00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.100\njust kinda cranking through a bit.\n\n169\n00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.250\nI think you kinda get the idea.\n\n170\n00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.910\nWe don't need to sit here and\nwatch the whole port scan.\n\n171\n00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.310\nJust, go through its paces.\n\n172\n00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:36.465\nSo, there are, again, there are other\nthings in here so we've got\n\n173\n00:10:36.465 --> 00:10:41.525\nMass Scan, we have DNS map,\n\n174\n00:10:41.525 --> 00:10:45.395\nwe have those ones, but\none more to take a look at is this one.\n\n175\n00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:49.060\nIt's this one called Automator.\n\n176\n00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.190\nAutomator.\n>> Automator?\n\n177\n00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.370\nNice.\n>> That sounds like.\n\n178\n00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.450\nSomeone in the south created this,\nI think.\n\n179\n00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:55.150\nAutomator.\n\n180\n00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:59.308\nSounds like a character\nfrom a Pixar movie.\n\n181\n00:10:59.308 --> 00:11:01.408\nSo-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n182\n00:11:01.408 --> 00:11:02.660\n>> [LAUGH] All right, but\n\n183\n00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:08.010\nwhat you can do with this is you can,\nthis utility actually gains information\n\n184\n00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.610\nfrom URLs and what's really neat about\nit does, again does take some time, but\n\n185\n00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:16.560\nwhen you run, it it actually looks at\nthat IP address that you give it and\n\n186\n00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.620\nit's looking for information it can\nfind with other services about that URL.\n\n187\n00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.590\nOr about actually about that IP address.\n\n188\n00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:28.000\nSo this case that's the IP\naddress of Microsoft.\n\n189\n00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.740\nAnd Microsoft has done some stuff to\nkind of block this type of stuff.\n\n190\n00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.260\nThey've kind of tightened it up.\n\n191\n00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.380\nBut that's fine for what I'm dong here,\nit was just to run a quick scan.\n\n192\n00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.270\nI didn't want this thing to take forever.\n\n193\n00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.170\nSometimes they can take forever\ndepending on the size of it.\n\n194\n00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:48.030\nSo this one just went through, and it ran\na scan, you can see it checked it up top.\n\n195\n00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.930\nI checked it against some stuff\nlike TechDefence and FortiGuard,\n\n196\n00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:55.920\nVirus Total, stuff like that, so it's\ntrying to see what it could find about\n\n197\n00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.600\nthat specific location.\n\n198\n00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.930\nIs there any reports relating to it, is\nthere any types of issues relating to it,\n\n199\n00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:08.090\nwhere's it ranked as far as\ndistribution of certain software.\n\n200\n00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.150\nIt would have that all in here.\n\n201\n00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.860\nSo, this one yet, they just don't\nhappen to be a part of that database.\n\n202\n00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:19.140\nBut it's something that you\nwould try against other\n\n203\n00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.830\nIP addresses to see, you know,\ndo those guys have anything on\n\n204\n00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:27.920\nfile as far these services go and seeing,\nwell, is that something you can use.\n\n205\n00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.530\nDo you know if they've distributed\nsomething where they have a vulnerability\n\n206\n00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.530\nor something that you\ncan take advantage of.\n\n207\n00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:37.340\nSo this is just another way of\ngathering information about a target.\n\n208\n00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.350\nThis one is, again,\nnot going against the target.\n\n209\n00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.610\nThis is a passive reconnaissance tool.\n\n210\n00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.990\nThis one is going out to these services,\nand taking that IP address, and saying,\n\n211\n00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:51.680\nokay, well I'm gonna drop these into\nthese services and see what I can find.\n\n212\n00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.370\nAnd it'll come back stuff sometimes,\nsometimes it'll come back with partials.\n\n213\n00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.300\nSome of them may come\nback with nothing at all.\n\n214\n00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.870\nBut it's always worth running something\nlike this to see if there's any useful\n\n215\n00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:05.140\nstuff kind of lurking about that\nyou may not want to overlook.\n\n216\n00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.220\n>> Just another tool to have in the kit,\nright?\n\n217\n00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.920\n>> Yeah, it definitely is, and these all,\n\n218\n00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.520\nmost of these are on\nthe menu by the way in here,\n\n219\n00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.400\njust in case you're wondering where\nam I kinda pulling these ones out of.\n\n220\n00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.850\nA lot of these are on the menu,\nbut notice the way I word that.\n\n221\n00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.440\nI said a lot of them are on the menu.\n\n222\n00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.330\nYou didn't hear me say all\nof them are on the menu.\n\n223\n00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.520\nThere's a lot of stuff that Kali\ndoes not put on these menus.\n\n224\n00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.820\nThere is actually something that is only\naccessible right to the command line.\n\n225\n00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.000\nYou have to know it's there.\n\n226\n00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.660\nSo be aware that when you're\nusing somebody's tools and\n\n227\n00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.010\nlooking at some of these tools.\n\n228\n00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.900\nWhy isn't it there?\n\n229\n00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:45.200\nIt's not something that has any sort of\nplace on the menu that you could click on.\n\n230\n00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.670\nYou would have to go to command line and\ntype it in to get that to work.\n\n231\n00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.320\nBe prepared for that.\n\n232\n00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.510\nWhen you're doing it, when you're\nlooking at some of these things.\n\n233\n00:13:53.682 --> 00:14:00.250\nMass Scan was one that it listed as\npart of Kali's tools set but it's not\n\n234\n00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:04.815\nsomething that's installed by default and\nyou actually have to get it and run it.\n\n235\n00:14:04.815 --> 00:14:08.340\nAutomator doesn't show up in the menus.\n\n236\n00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.240\nTypically doesn't show\nup in the menus without\n\n237\n00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.970\ndoing some sort of customization or\nsomething, doesn't show up there.\n\n238\n00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.400\nBut it's something that you\ncan go to the command line,\n\n239\n00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.360\nrun it and go about your business with it.\n\n240\n00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.200\nYou know, so do remember that.\n\n241\n00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.195\nIt's, when you go through the list\nof tools that Kali has or\n\n242\n00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:26.000\ngo through the menu in here, not\neverything's gonna show up in the menu.\n\n243\n00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.900\nYou could really be short-changing\nyourself if you're going through this\n\n244\n00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.080\nsaying oh, what interesting\nstuff do I have in the menu?\n\n245\n00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.870\nOkay, well that's about it,\nthat's all I've got.\n\n246\n00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.935\nNo, that's not all you got.\n\n247\n00:14:35.935 --> 00:14:38.895\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's a lot more in there waiting to\n\n248\n00:14:38.895 --> 00:14:40.955\nbe discovered by you.\n\n249\n00:14:40.955 --> 00:14:44.985\nI think it says that Kali has something\nlike over 400 tools in it and\n\n250\n00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:45.825\nthat gets bumped up.\n\n251\n00:14:45.825 --> 00:14:48.565\nI want to say it's more than that, but\n\n252\n00:14:48.565 --> 00:14:51.685\nI can sure as heck tell you that\nbetween all these little submenus and\n\n253\n00:14:51.685 --> 00:14:55.416\neverything on there, there ain't 400 tools\non that menu so they got to go someplace.\n\n254\n00:14:55.416 --> 00:14:58.060\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well Sean,\n\n255\n00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.690\ngood look at some of the Footprinting\ntools available in Kali.\n\n256\n00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.770\nAny others that we want to mention?\n\n257\n00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:07.730\n>> Well there's not anything specific\nI'd want to mention at this point\n\n258\n00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:12.290\nas far as tools that I think\nyou should absolutely go into.\n\n259\n00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.700\nJust remember there's\nplenty of tools in there.\n\n260\n00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.950\nWaiting for you to explore and try out,\nand you know, try them out and\n\n261\n00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:19.590\nsee what they get.\n\n262\n00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.400\nYou may be getting the same information\nfrom one tool that you got from\n\n263\n00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.390\nthe other one that's well known, but you\nnever know what's gonna happen on sites.\n\n264\n00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:30.870\nSomething on a site can prevent you from\nusing the tools that you've become so\n\n265\n00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:34.170\nnear and dear to, those are gonna\nbe ripped out of your hands.\n\n266\n00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:38.380\nI've heard some really interesting\nstuff on site where that have happened.\n\n267\n00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.680\nI've had some stuff happen to me,\ninteresting on-sites with clients.\n\n268\n00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.320\nIt's just, you better be able to adapt,\n\n269\n00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.850\nbe able to run that test,\nbecause they expect you to, and\n\n270\n00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.048\nyou really should be able to get a ticket\nto get work done, is the way I look at it.\n\n271\n00:15:51.048 --> 00:15:56.230\nOr at least get as close as you\npossibly can by giving it all you got.\n\n272\n00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.470\nYou know, so, get used to these sayings.\n\n273\n00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:59.720\nGet comfortable with them.\n\n274\n00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.940\nYou know, who knows,\nthere's cases I kid you not,\n\n275\n00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.500\nthere's cases where pen testers have\ngone onsite and they told them, yeah,\n\n276\n00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.080\nyou don't get to bring any\nhardware in with you at all.\n\n277\n00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:09.710\nNo hardware.\n\n278\n00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.140\nNothing.\nIf you bring your laptop,\n\n279\n00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.300\nyou can bring it in but\nit won't make it out.\n\n280\n00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.315\nIt's like a roach hotel or something.\n\n281\n00:16:14.315 --> 00:16:15.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Get's in, but\n\n282\n00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.820\nyou won't get out, they will do that,\nin fact, interestingly enough,\n\n283\n00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.090\nthat's how Kali was actually created,\n\n284\n00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:23.700\nthe guy that gave birth to it originally\nsaid that, that was the challenge.\n\n285\n00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.770\nThey told him, we need you to do a pen\ntest, but you can't bring anything in,\n\n286\n00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:31.550\nyou can't do this, you can't do that,\nyou can just show up, it's you.\n\n287\n00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.280\nAnd so, he was able to.\n\n288\n00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.320\nHe was able to look at the rules, and\nthey said yeah, you can bring a CD in, and\n\n289\n00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.490\nthus, Kali was born.\n\n290\n00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.530\nOur backtrack was originally born, and\n\n291\n00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.510\nthen it gave birth to all\nthe stuff down the road.\n\n292\n00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:46.240\nIf that teaches us anything,\nit's flexibility.\n\n293\n00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.380\nYou've gotta be dynamic.\n\n294\n00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.450\nWhat are you going to do if they\nsay you can't have that computer,\n\n295\n00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:50.365\nhave a nice pen test!\n\n296\n00:16:50.365 --> 00:16:53.886\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, a lot of great information,\n\n297\n00:16:53.886 --> 00:16:56.221\nwe hope everybody enjoyed it.\n\n298\n00:16:56.221 --> 00:16:58.922\nStay tuned for more how-tos coming soon.\n\n299\n00:16:58.922 -->

00:00:13.610\nI'm your host Mike Broderick and\nwith me today is Sean Oriyano, and\n\n4\n00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.580\nhe's gonna show us some\nthings we can do with NMAP.\n\n5\n00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.120\nSo Sean what do you got for us today?\n\n6\n00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.220\n>> What we're gonna do is we're gonna take\na little bit of a closer look at NMAP.\n\n7\n00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.070\nAnd, the idea here is\nto show you initially\n\n8\n00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.830\nsome of the stuff that you can do with\nNMAP, that you may not have thought of.\n\n9\n00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.570\nAnd also kind of mixing some\nof the different techniques.\n\n10\n00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.835\nAnd then we'll start to move on to more,\nand more interesting and stuff, hopefully.\n\n11\n00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:42.105\nSo just to kind of set the stage here.\n\n12\n00:00:42.105 --> 00:00:46.975\nWhat we did with NMAP in the past, when\nwe did our ethical hacking exploration,\n\n13\n00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:51.090\nwe did our forensic stuff with NMAP, and\nstuff that you may have done with NMAP In\n\n14\n00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.750\nthe past as we know NMAP has a very\npowerful and potent scanner of ports.\n\n15\n00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.180\nIt does that very, very well.\n\n16\n00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.880\nWe can scan it for open ports,\nwe can configure the scan.\n\n17\n00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.420\nWe can scan whole subnets, and we can do\nall sorts of interesting things with that.\n\n18\n00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.790\nBut what we're gonna try to\ndo is we're gonna try to see\n\n19\n00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.500\nwhat those scans look like a little bit,\n\n20\n00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.700\nand then we're also gonna see some of the\nmore advanced things that you can do to\n\n21\n00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.600\nplug into NMAP to get it to do stuff that\nyou may not have ever seen it do before.\n\n22\n00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.820\nMaybe even thought it\nwas capable of doing.\n\n23\n00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.100\nSo it's kind of some neat\nstuff I like to think.\n\n24\n00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.130\n>> Nice, I'm excited.\n\n25\n00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.150\nLet's dive into it.\n\n26\n00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.530\n>> All right.\n\n27\n00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.280\nSo what I've got here is\nobviously My Virtual System, and\n\n28\n00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.870\nwhat I'm gonna do is\nwhen I use NMAP in Kali,\n\n29\n00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.240\nwhich I don't have up now,\nI'll switch over to that in a second.\n\n30\n00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.760\nThe first thing I wanna do is just kind\nof give you an idea of something that\n\n31\n00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.500\ndoes get asked is when you're using\nsomething like NMAP, how can you pick up\n\n32\n00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.380\nif NMAP is actually\npresent doing scanning?\n\n33\n00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.310\nWell we know that there's\ndifferent ways of doing that.\n\n34\n00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.210\nWe know that we have IDS's,\nwe know that we have network and\n\n35\n00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.130\nhost based IDS's, we know we have the\nfirewalls and we know that we can check\n\n36\n00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.690\na lot of stuff out there to look for\nthe fingerprints of a scan.\n\n37\n00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.970\nBut there are other ways, and this is\njust one way, another way, of doing that.\n\n38\n00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.150\nWhat I'm going to run here for\nyou is a script called PortDog.\n\n39\n00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.160\nIt's written in Python.\n\n40\n00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.250\nAnd so I've already gone ahead and\ndownloaded it, and\n\n41\n00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.680\nyou can actually Google PortDog\nif you're interested in that.\n\n42\n00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.170\nIt's still a brand new script,\nbut hey, go ahead and try it out.\n\n43\n00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.360\nThe guy's looking for feedback, so\nyou might as well try to break it.\n\n44\n00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.340\nSo it's a simple script, so\ngo ahead and download it, and\n\n45\n00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.530\nif you wanna try this, and so what I'm\ngonna do here is I've got that downloaded\n\n46\n00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.910\nalready, I will go ahead and\nstart that for us.\n\n47\n00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.940\nIt's gonna ask for\nmy password to run that.\n\n48\n00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.280\nSo I have PortDog running.\n\n49\n00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.640\nAs you can see, it just popped up and\n\n50\n00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.900\nsays okay,\nI have PortDogs running on this system.\n\n51\n00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.505\nYeah, ask me how I know PortDog's running.\n\n52\n00:03:01.505 --> 00:03:04.565\n[LAUGH]\n>> How do you know PortDog's running?\n\n53\n00:03:04.565 --> 00:03:08.760\n[LAUGH]\n>> So I've got PortDog running here.\n\n54\n00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.630\nWhat I'm gonna do is I am gonna\ngo over to my Kali system now and\n\n55\n00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.520\nI've already acquired the IP address\nof the other system, so no big deal.\n\n56\n00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.190\nSo what I'm gonna is I'm gonna\njust run a simple scan here.\n\n57\n00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.340\nI've targeted that IP address you know and\n\n58\n00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.550\nI've told it to type a scan, got all of\nthat going and so nothing really complex.\n\n59\n00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.030\nBut at least you know on the NMAP site,\nnothing complex yet.\n\n60\n00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.260\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and run it\nan you see it came back with something and\n\n61\n00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.890\nit didn't look like it did much, right?\n\n62\n00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.130\nYou know, so.\n\n63\n00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.770\n>> All right.\n\n64\n00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.220\n>> But again,\nremember what we're trying to do.\n\n65\n00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.890\nWe're trying to detect NMAP scans,\nand sure as heck,\n\n66\n00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.180\nwith what I'm looking at right now,\nI'm not going to detect it.\n\n67\n00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.200\nIf you need feedback at this\npoint that the scan actually ran,\n\n68\n00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.360\nyou'll need to pause this and\ngo [LAUGH] set your NMAP's up.\n\n69\n00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.710\nSo, I know here that's running.\n\n70\n00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.740\nBut the question is how do I detect it\non the other side, the target side?\n\n71\n00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.610\nAnd so that side just went ahead and\nset up PortDog over there, so\n\n72\n00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.020\nif I go look at PortDog.\n\n73\n00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.640\nPortDog has told me heck,\nhere's some stuff that's, you know,\n\n74\n00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.290\nhere's whats going on.\n\n75\n00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.200\nYou know, you can see my IP\naddress of the other system.\n\n76\n00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.220\nIt says, you know, 192.168.254.139, and\nyou can see it's gone right through and\n\n77\n00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.630\nsaid, hey, it's,\nsomebody's attempting to connect to that.\n\n78\n00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.130\nPort, and it says, well it's closed.\n\n79\n00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.370\nBut it's gone right on through\nthe list here telling me,\n\n80\n00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.570\nheck these things are somebody's\ntrying to do something with it.\n\n81\n00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.300\n>> So it's telling you that somebody\nis scanning your system and\n\n82\n00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.830\nit's telling you who is scanning it.\n\n83\n00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.880\nOr the IP address that\nthe scan is coming from.\n\n84\n00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.270\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n85\n00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.670\nSo that's kinda neet right there.\n\n86\n00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.870\nBut let's, come on,\nwe're not gonna leave it at that.\n\n87\n00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:51.950\n>> Let's step it up a notch.\n\n88\n00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.285\n>> Yeah, we can,\nthat's amateur league stuff, come on.\n\n89\n00:04:55.285 --> 00:04:57.140\n[LAUGH] We can bump it up a bit,\n\n90\n00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.660\nwe can bump it up a bit on\nhere by kicking this up.\n\n91\n00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.270\nI've already went ahead and\ntyped it in here,\n\n92\n00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.690\nbecause as you guys I'm\na slow typist over here.\n\n93\n00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.690\nWhoops, close that.\n\n94\n00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.300\nWhat I'm going to do is,\nlet's see where is it.\n\n95\n00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.960\nI just typed it in.\n\n96\n00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.800\nWhat I'm going to do is, how do you,\nman I do way too much stuff.\n\n97\n00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.790\nLook at that command history list.\n\n98\n00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.228\nI'm already tired.\n\n99\n00:05:23.228 --> 00:05:27.620\nSo what I want to do\nhere is I want to show\n\n100\n00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.110\nI don't want my IP address\nto pop up right in there.\n\n101\n00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.946\nSo, it's in here somewhere in my history.\n\n102\n00:05:34.946 --> 00:05:37.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm doing a lot.\n\n103\n00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.490\nI am working way too hard.\n\n104\n00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.400\nThis is why I've got bags under my eyes.\n\n105\n00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.520\nBut the next step here would be on NMAP.\n\n106\n00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.290\nWould be you know how can you,\nyou know just keep yourself off the radar?\n\n107\n00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.170\nI've got my IP address\nplastered all over that, right?\n\n108\n00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.920\n>> Right.\n>> So I want to not have it plastered all\n\n109\n00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.080\nover the place.\n\n110\n00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.800\nWell I can actually.\n\n111\n00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.080\nyou know go ahead and fix that.\n\n112\n00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.050\nAnd I said,\none of the problems that we have\n\n113\n00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.949\nwithin NMAP is that it does leave\nsome very visible fingerprints.\n\n114\n00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.240\nIn a log someplace, and\nthat's gonna be a problem.\n\n115\n00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.377\nWe definitely want to, when we're doing a\nport scan, you can make it more stealthy.\n\n116\n00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:18.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We know that.\n\n117\n00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.440\nWe know we can do little things to\ntweak the scan different ways and\n\n118\n00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.690\nmake it less visible,\njust the timing of it.\n\n119\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.680\nThere's a T-flag in there that you can\nuse to make the timing more aggressive or\n\n120\n00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.580\nless aggressive, passive-aggressive,\nI don't know whatever you call it.\n\n121\n00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.400\n>> [INAUDIBLE] over there that's no bueno.\n\n122\n00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.470\n>> Yeah we can't have that.\n\n123\n00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.310\nWe've got to do something.\n\n124\n00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.200\nOr we don't have to but\nit's not a bad idea to kind of at least\n\n125\n00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.820\nminimize our footprint or\neliminate our footprint.\n\n126\n00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.810\nSo we saw that when I\nlooked over at PortdDog\n\n127\n00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.910\nit showed me right away that hey\nthis guy is going to this guy and\n\n128\n00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.990\nwe saw repeated scans going from there\nall the way down through all the probes.\n\n129\n00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.820\nYou know so that's easy enough for someone\nkind of trace it back to some point.\n\n130\n00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.580\nWe can change that though, that's not\nsomething that is written in stone.\n\n131\n00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:14.120\nFortunately, the way we can change that\nis mmat gives us a special flag to\n\n132\n00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.660\ndo that if you look at what\nI've got on my screen here.\n\n133\n00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.420\nHopefully, that's clear enough to you.\n\n134\n00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:29.060\nIf you look at the bottom,\nwhat you see there is NMAP -sS.\n\n135\n00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.830\nThat's for doing a SIN-scan.\n\n136\n00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.410\nThen we look and we see an IP address,\nthat's the target.\n\n137\n00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.610\nThat would be good enough\nunder most conditions,\n\n138\n00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.790\nthat would be good enough\nto leave right there.\n\n139\n00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.760\nSo I've changed it a bit by using\nthat -D tack, with a capital D.\n\n140\n00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.560\nThat's a tag called decoy tag.\n\n141\n00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.235\nAnd so what you can do is you say -D and\ninput 5.5.5.\n\n142\n00:07:53.235 --> 00:07:55.380\nSomething that's very visible.\n\n143\n00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.753\nI can even in some cases, you can go\nthrough and do stuff like this too.\n\n144\n00:07:59.753 --> 00:08:02.266\n>> That's gotta drive an IT guy nuts.\n\n145\n00:08:02.266 --> 00:08:03.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you don't really do that.\n\n146\n00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:08.822\nYou hit Enter, and\nokay it went through and did the scan, but\n\n147\n00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:14.367\nif I look over at the results that\nare happening in my Ubuntu system,\n\n148\n00:08:14.367 --> 00:08:18.180\ntake a good look if we\nbring that in a bit.\n\n149\n00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.440\nWe can see what's going on.\n\n150\n00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.430\nYou can see 5.5.5.5 I've got 6.6.6.6.\n\n151\n00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.120\nI've got my own IP address in there.\n\n152\n00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.770\nAnd depending on how aggressive\nI want to get with this,\n\n153\n00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.290\nI can start masking that even more.\n\n154\n00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.680\nI can make the whole thing look\nlike it came from someplace else.\n\n155\n00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.632\nAnd if you really want to mix it up and\nkind of muddy the waters,\n\n156\n00:08:35.632 --> 00:08:40.572\nyou can just go after the dash, d tag and\nput space and put IP address, comma,\n\n157\n00:08:40.572 --> 00:08:46.100\nIP address, comma, IP address, you can\nput all sort of combination in there.\n\n158\n00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.890\nAll it cares is that you've\nstuck something in there, and\n\n159\n00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.030\nit kind of looks like an IP address.\n\n160\n00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.700\nAnd it will pop up on\nthe other side like that.\n\n161\n00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.450\n>> Wow.\n>> I have never tried putting letters\n\n162\n00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.460\nin there, but now I'm curious.\n\n163\n00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:04.000\n>> That's like masking where\nyou're coming from though, and\n\n164\n00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.610\nthat's what you want is to avoid getting\nyour IP address in those log files or\n\n165\n00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.720\nshowing up in those\n>> Ideas logs.\n\n166\n00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.920\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n167\n00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.400\nSo if you've got that\nsitting right over there and\n\n168\n00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.350\nyou could just start putting\nan IP address in there,\n\n169\n00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.940\nand then comma, another IP address,\ncomma, another IP address.\n\n170\n00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.460\nAnd just keep going right\non down the line, and\n\n171\n00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.290\nyou can use that in conjunction\nwith any of your other flags.\n\n172\n00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:30.590\nWith some exceptions, you can use\njust about any other flag that's\n\n173\n00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.150\nout there available for N Map\n>> And it will do those same results.\n\n174\n00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.210\nYou know, if you,\nunder some conditions it will say,\n\n175\n00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.320\nI'm not going to leave anything\nbehind of your IP address.\n\n176\n00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.960\nI'm gonna put something\nelse in there entirely.\n\n177\n00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.040\n[LAUGH] So, fun and games to be had.\n\n178\n00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:51.060\nLike I said, if you want to do, if you\nwant to be the one that tries to do,\n\n179\n00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.860\nyou know, one these deals,\nand sticks letters in there.\n\n180\n00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.870\nYou know it didn't go ahead and\nuse the letters.\n\n181\n00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.800\nBut, you know hey,I just tried it for you.\n\n182\n00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.080\nI was kind of curious.\n\n183\n00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.670\nI never met her before, so\nyou guys got to see me be a test pilot.\n\n184\n00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:08.740\nBut I you can put different\ncombinations of numbers in there,\n\n185\n00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.390\nand it's going to just go ahead and\npop up on the other side.\n\n186\n00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:19.090\nWith there's my scan and you just go over\nto your other system and there we go.\n\n187\n00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:21.200\nI went through and I put 1,\n2, 3, 4, is it in there?\n\n188\n00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.980\nAnd now you can see 1, 2,\n3, 4 and .4 sixes, .55.\n\n189\n00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.990\nYou can see it's mixed it up\nas far as what it does, and\n\n190\n00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:33.110\nalso notice by the way it didn't go\njust kind of keep rotating it too.\n\n191\n00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.140\nIt didn't go 5, 5, 5, 6, and went 2, 3,\n4 Notice it started one, two, three,\n\n192\n00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.190\nfour at the end.\n\n193\n00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:41.180\nThen it went quadruple six, quadruple\nfive, then it went quadruple six,\n\n194\n00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.130\nthen quadruple five three times and\none, two, three, four.\n\n195\n00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.980\nIt's even randomizing it too.\n\n196\n00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.220\nIt's really kind of mixing it up and\nmaking it interesting,\n\n197\n00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.790\nwhich you got to love that.\n\n198\n00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.310\nSo, there you go.\n\n199\n00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.120\nSo as a quick way on the,\n\n200\n00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.930\na script that very quickly on\nthe host side detects port scanning.\n\n201\n00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.780\nBut then we also have a way of using Nmap,\nnow that we can see what's happening,\n\n202\n00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.190\nand we also have a quick way of using\nNmap to kinda mix those results up.\n\n203\n00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.140\nSo you can have a lot of fun and\ngames with that.\n\n204\n00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:17.190\nAs the case may be, but there's\nobviously a lot more that NMap can do.\n\n205\n00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:23.360\nThis is still, we're still at that kind of\nthat the tip of the iceberg type stage.\n\n206\n00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.950\nSo, it begs the question what they\nare what else can you do with Nmap?\n\n207\n00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.590\n>> I'll ask it what else\ncan we do with end map?\n\n208\n00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.835\n>> I'm glad you asked.\n\n209\n00:11:32.835 --> 00:11:36.370\n[LAUGH]\n>> What you can do it this this is another\n\n210\n00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:39.900\ncombination of things you can do with it.\n\n211\n00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.680\nYou can see on here is,\nprobably will have to copy and\n\n212\n00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.050\npaste this into a discussion group.\n\n213\n00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.540\n[LAUGH] What this script does is,\n\n214\n00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.600\nif you look at the beginning of it,\nwhat's happened is it's running.\n\n215\n00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.580\nYou can see it's running Nmap and it's\nflagging all the stuff with the script.\n\n216\n00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:04.260\nAnd then you can see I've got if you look\nclose I can see 192.168.254.1-200 so\n\n217\n00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:09.460\nit's scanning a range of IP addresses,\nso 1 to 200 scanning.\n\n218\n00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:14.140\nAnd then that's where it does the pipe and\nthen it uses the grep command and\n\n219\n00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.700\nthen it comes through and\nit says it puts in.\n\n220\n00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.160\nIt has in quotes running, so that's going\nto print that to the screen and then it's\n\n221\n00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.040\ngoing through it, and as you can see it\nhas stuff like Linux, all of it in there.\n\n222\n00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.630\nSo let's see what this is doing,\ninstead of me going in dissecting it,\n\n223\n00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:26.530\ntalking about it.\n\n224\n00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.410\nIt's kind of obvious to see\non screen what it reads.\n\n225\n00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:30.480\nLet's see what this is gonna do.\n\n226\n00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.640\nThis is going to do a scan, but\n\n227\n00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.840\nit's going to do more than\njust a regular scan for us.\n\n228\n00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.580\nSo it's gonna scan that range.\n\n229\n00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.510\nIt'll take a few moments,\nbut what you're doing here,\n\n230\n00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:44.500\nis you are using this in a situation\nwhere you've gotta answer the question,\n\n231\n00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.040\nwhat operating systems\nare running on that subnet?\n\n232\n00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.350\nSo you could do it the old\ntraditional way with it with Nmap and\n\n233\n00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.680\ndissect all of that information.\n\n234\n00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.440\nBut what's being done here is if\nyou look it popped up the results.\n\n235\n00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.410\nIt says hey I've found one Linux device,\none Windows device.\n\n236\n00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.110\nIt went through and\njust stuck it right out there.\n\n237\n00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:06.100\nTold me right away that it found it,\nand now I know what lives there.\n\n238\n00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.770\nIt'd be very easy if you\nwanted to get into it,\n\n239\n00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.970\nto actually tweak that\nscript a bit more and\n\n240\n00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:14.990\nhave it include the IP addresses of those\nsystems because it knows it, it's there.\n\n241\n00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.770\nIt just hasn't been displayed\nas the final result.\n\n242\n00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.980\nI could easily take that and say, boom.\n\n243\n00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.310\nI know how many Windows devices,\n\n244\n00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.320\nhow many Linux devices are out there,\ntake that boom, pipe it to a file.\n\n245\n00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.170\nAnd open it up and\nsee the IP addresses and\n\n246\n00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:34.310\nnow I can start refining my\nattack more from this point.\n\n247\n00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:40.920\nI mean, so that's a neat\nlittle thing to do with Nmap.\n\n248\n00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.600\nSo what you're doing here is you're taking\nNmap plus the native Linux commands,\n\n249\n00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.290\ncuz all that stuff really after that pipe,\nthose are all Linux commands.\n\n250\n00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.620\nThat's not something that\nNmap is doing itself.\n\n251\n00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.630\nThat's stuff Linux itself is doing.\n\n252\n00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.530\nAnd so we combine all those things\nto get something that is giving us\n\n253\n00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.090\nsomething kinda sorta specific.\n\n254\n00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.280\nSo I like that.\n\n255\n00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:07.220\nI like seeing that, cuz it just gives me\nanother way of dissecting no information.\n\n256\n00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:12.330\nSo, you can keep that in your toolkit and\nI guess we can pace that in.\n\n257\n00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:17.220\n>> I'll make sure we have the command\nrunning in the show notes for\n\n258\n00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.450\nthis episode.\n\n259\n00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:23.370\nSo look for those there if you're watching\nthis, and wanna see what Seans actually\n\n260\n00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:27.240\ntyping out, but\nI'll make sure I get those from him.\n\n261\n00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.928\n>> For our written transcript,\nhit pause and start writing, right?\n\n262\n00:14:31.928 --> 00:14:34.280\n[LAUGH] And so, we've got that going on.\n\n263\n00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.380\nSo that's one little trick you can do.\n\n264\n00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:41.570\nAnd what I'm trying to show here,\nIt's that if I've gone through and\n\n265\n00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:46.230\nI've showed you a way that you can see\nscanning, you know from another system.\n\n266\n00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.130\nThen I showed you how you can\nkind of high track the scanning,\n\n267\n00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.560\nI'm showing you additional switch.\n\n268\n00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.790\nWhat this is doing, I'm showing you\nsomething else to kind of get your\n\n269\n00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:58.270\ngears turning, is that you're\nnot stuck with just combining,\n\n270\n00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.750\nwith using enmap switches and\nall sorts of combinations.\n\n271\n00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:06.070\nThis is now combining the Nmap\nplus other things it's running,\n\n272\n00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:09.880\nand it's manipulating and\ntransforming that content, and looking for\n\n273\n00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.060\nspecific information and displaying that.\n\n274\n00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:16.094\nSo I'm kinda getting used to that,\nso we can see what's going on.\n\n275\n00:15:16.094 --> 00:15:19.840\nOkay, so keep that in mind.\n\n276\n00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.370\nIt's more than just\na simple scanning tool.\n\n277\n00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:28.330\nBut yeah, we can do a lot of other stuff\nwith this, it's not stuck with just doing\n\n278\n00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.420\ndecoy, It's not stuck,\nwe're just doing any those sort of things.\n\n279\n00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.220\nWe can keep going further and\nfurther, since there is the ability\n\n280\n00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.910\nto even do scripts in here.\n\n281\n00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:46.620\nI can do scripts,\nthose scripts can do password cracking.\n\n282\n00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.826\nYou can correct your own scripts for this,\n\n283\n00:15:48.826 --> 00:15:51.715\nif you want they can do all\nsorts of interesting things.\n\n284\n00:15:51.715 --> 00:15:55.987\nYou can do stuff like grab a VNC info.\n\n285\n00:15:55.987 --> 00:15:59.087\nI've got one that I'm gonna\nrun here in a little bit.\n\n286\n00:15:59.087 --> 00:16:04.435\nThat you can run Nmap and then do\nsomething called the scripting switch,\n\n287\n00:16:04.435 --> 00:16:10.980\nwhich will, you go, you run Nmap then do\ndash dash and you run the actual script.\n\n288\n00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:15.040\nLet me actually, because this is\ngonna get real nasty with text and\n\n289\n00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.036\nstuff like that on screen.\n\n290\n00:16:16.036 --> 00:16:17.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's gonna be.\n\n291\n00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.425\n>> Okay I follow it.\n\n292\n00:16:19.425 --> 00:16:22.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what you can do is you can do Nmap.\n\n293\n00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.580\nDo dash dash and do script and\nthen you can do.\n\n294\n00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:30.050\nIn fact let me back up here just a second.\n\n295\n00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.380\nWhat I've done just to kind of show you.\n\n296\n00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.550\nI have on my system here.\n\n297\n00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.540\nYou can see I've got .nse\nscripts in this folder.\n\n298\n00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:43.350\nThese dot NSE scripts,\nthese are net script, or\n\n299\n00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:46.060\nsorry, Nmap scripting environment.\n\n300\n00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.670\nWhat you can do is,\nthere's plenty of these online.\n\n301\n00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.970\nYou can go to the nmap.org site and\ngrab these if you want.\n\n302\n00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.170\nAnd you can go ahead and run them.\n\n303\n00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.610\nNow, be careful if you run these things.\n\n304\n00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:00.860\nFirst of all, if you're gonna be lazy like\nme and just go up to the site and And\n\n305\n00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:01.660\ndownload the scripts.\n\n306\n00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.660\nThe scripts will usually\ndownload as a text file.\n\n307\n00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:09.140\nI would be very careful on right clicking\nand saying save link a,s because if you do\n\n308\n00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:13.480\nthat, sometimes your browser will\nformat those things as an html file.\n\n309\n00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.730\nOr stick other stuff in there.\n\n310\n00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.150\nPython, or\n\n311\n00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:22.520\nin this case the scripting engine\nwill just take a puke all over that.\n\n312\n00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:27.220\nIt will say, I'm not doing that because I\ndon't get it., so be careful with that.\n\n313\n00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:31.620\nWhat I say is, if you're not sure its\ngoing to download it as plain text,\n\n314\n00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:38.490\nthen you may wanna copy that script\nby hand, by doing a copy and past.\n\n315\n00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.650\nCopy it and\npaste into whatever your favorite\n\n316\n00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:48.130\nplain text editor is, and\nthen save it out as a dot nse file.\n\n317\n00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.900\nAnd you can do that on Windows or Linux.\n\n318\n00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.060\nI just happen to be doing it on Linux.\n\n319\n00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.410\nYou can do it on Windows.\n\n320\n00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:57.880\nSo I've got that but if I wanna use,\nlet's say that vnc info one.\n\n321\n00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:04.350\nIf i wanna make use of that, the way it's\ngonna work is that n map dash dash script.\n\n322\n00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.675\nAnd then what you do is you\nput the name of the script.\n\n323\n00:18:05.675 --> 00:18:09.805\nScripts so I want to do VNC-info.\n\n324\n00:18:09.805 --> 00:18:11.975\nI will go ahead and do that.\n\n325\n00:18:11.975 --> 00:18:15.135\nAnd then it typically is going to add,\nyou're going to put a port number or\n\n326\n00:18:15.135 --> 00:18:15.855\nsomething in there.\n\n327\n00:18:15.855 --> 00:18:19.195\nYou're going to say -P and\ntarget a specific port.\n\n328\n00:18:19.195 --> 00:18:26.255\nOn this case, the system I am targeting I\ncan put in, there's my IP address for it.\n\n329\n00:18:26.255 --> 00:18:28.670\nI believe I'm at .132.\n\n330\n00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:33.600\nSo, if I do that, you know,\nwhen it hit and ran the script for me, and\n\n331\n00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:39.160\nyou can see what happened is, it went\nthrough and targeted that Nmap scan.\n\n332\n00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:44.070\nIf you ignored the scripting switch in\nthe VNC info, what is has after that.\n\n333\n00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.490\nIs it has dash p, the port 5900.\n\n334\n00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.980\nI already scanned it ahead of time\n\n335\n00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.430\nto find out what port VNC\nwas specifically listed on.\n\n336\n00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:58.200\nSo I'm saying scan that port and\nat this IP address, but\n\n337\n00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.980\ndon't just do a regular scan.\n\n338\n00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.750\nWhat it's saying is run this\nscript this VNC info script and\n\n339\n00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:08.350\nextract information from that service and\ntelling me to tell me about it.\n\n340\n00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:11.260\nSo it's doing banner grab, but\n\n341\n00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.830\nit's doing what I want to think\nof as an enhanced banner grab.\n\n342\n00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.470\nBecause what you're seeing there,\nis you're seeing information,\n\n343\n00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.480\nyou know there's the protocol version, and\n\n344\n00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.460\ndepending on how lucky you are and\nwhat version of this they're using,\n\n345\n00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:28.590\nyou will see the security types that this\nsupports or that VNC server supports.\n\n346\n00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.070\nThis one on this Metasploitable\nsystem that I'm using,\n\n347\n00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:37.190\nthey've configured it all sorts of\nscrewy ways to make it more vulnerable.\n\n348\n00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:39.350\nSo in this case it's not even\ndisplaying security type,\n\n349\n00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.280\nbecause of all the tweaks they did to it.\n\n350\n00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:46.240\nBut this will work against any VNC system,\nso if you have\n\n351\n00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.010\nanother implementation of it you can\nuse that to pull the same information.\n\n352\n00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:55.390\nAnd that's really just, again, I keep\nusing the term the tip of the iceberg,\n\n353\n00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:59.860\nbecause the scripts give\nyou a lot of latitude\n\n354\n00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.220\nas far as what you can do with Nmap.\n\n355\n00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:05.160\nAnd the cool thing about it is those\nscripts are, if you didn't pick it up,\n\n356\n00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.560\nthey are plain text scripts, and\nthat whole language is documented.\n\n357\n00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.616\nSo if you're someone that's good at this,\nyou can, for further documentation\n\n358\n00:20:13.616 --> 00:20:18.180\non nmap.org and tweak out and customize\nyour scripts to a really high degree.\n\n359\n00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.860\nAnd get to do stuff that you probably\ndidn't think Nmap was capable of,\n\n360\n00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.100\nbut it very much is.\n\n361\n00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.660\nSo this is something that I kinda wanted\nto bring to your attention as the tip and\n\n362\n00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:32.350\ntrick, because we've got all those\nswitches that you can easily look up and\n\n363\n00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:35.330\nsee all these switches of\nstuff that Nmap can do.\n\n364\n00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:39.880\nBut this takes it to another level,\nbecause those scripts allow you to do\n\n365\n00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:45.390\nstuff that just those switches\non their own can't do.\n\n366\n00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.400\nYou'd really be amazed.\n\n367\n00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.740\nNow, there's also something\nelse that fits in here.\n\n368\n00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:56.170\nNmap also has libraries available for it\ntoo, like DLL type deals that Windows has.\n\n369\n00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.550\nIt's got those type of things, so\nsome people have written those libraries\n\n370\n00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:03.190\nthat you can drop into Nmap, and\nNmap will hook into those, and\n\n371\n00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:06.690\nthen you can get your own script with it\ntoo, and it can even extend nmap even\n\n372\n00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:11.900\nfurther to let it do stuff way, way above\nand outside what normal port scanning is.\n\n373\n00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:12.960\n>> Wow, that's very impressive.\n\n374\n00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.170\nWe've always called Nmap\nthe Swiss Army Knife of utilities,\n\n375\n00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.790\nwe just went from the ten-tool\nSwiss Army Knife to like\n\n376\n00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:23.750\na 100-tool swiss army knife;\nthat big fat one there.\n\n377\n00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.700\nSo Sean\n>> I got a master sword\n\n378\n00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.520\n>> That was great stuff Sean,\n\n379\n00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.540\nI hope everyone out there enjoyed it.\n\n380\n00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:34.393\nStay tuned for more exciting tips and\ntrick with Nmap coming up

00:00:13.730\nI'm your host Mike Broderick and\nwith me today, is Mr. Sean Oriyano and\n\n4\n00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.260\nhe's gonna show us some tips and tricks,\nhow we can expand our use of Nmaps.\n\n5\n00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.668\nSo what do you got for us today, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:20.668 --> 00:00:25.520\n>> Well, I kinda got a bunch\nof different little things.\n\n7\n00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.160\nIt's kind of, some, not really\nmiscellaneous, but they're things,\n\n8\n00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.310\nsome different stuff to kind of push into\ndifferent areas of what Nmap can do and\n\n9\n00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.040\njust how it can help you.\n\n10\n00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.425\nIf you really think about it,\nknow about these features,\n\n11\n00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:43.180\nhow you can make things work a little\nbit more efficiently for you.\n\n12\n00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.960\nSo we talked about in the first part,\n\n13\n00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.110\nabout ways of detecting the scan,\ntweaking the scan just a little bit more,\n\n14\n00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.710\nhiding yourself from a scan, through\nthe decoy switch, which I love that one.\n\n15\n00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.980\nIt's just one of the many\nthings you can do.\n\n16\n00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.940\nBut we've still got plenty more.\n\n17\n00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.110\nI mean, once you get into Nmap, it's kind\nof amazing when you go to the Nmap site.\n\n18\n00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.950\nIf you ever look at the documentation,\nit's like really, really, really long,\n\n19\n00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.850\nit looks way longer than it should be, for\n\n20\n00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.585\nsomething that most people have\nonly ever used as a port scanner.\n\n21\n00:01:13.585 --> 00:01:16.240\nI'm like,\nwhy is there that much documentation?\n\n22\n00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.930\nWhy is documentation that thick?\n\n23\n00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.700\nAnd they got nothing,\nin there as far as a tool goes.\n\n24\n00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.833\nWell it's because you really\nhaven't used all of it yet.\n\n25\n00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:26.870\n[LAUGH] That's what it comes down to.\n\n26\n00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.260\n>> Well show us how we can dive in or\nstart using it for\n\n27\n00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.140\na little more than just doing a port scan.\n\n28\n00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.330\n>> So that's what we're trying to do.\n\n29\n00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.740\nWe're trying to expand a new area.\n\n30\n00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.910\nSo with that being said,\nlet me show you one way that we can\n\n31\n00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.480\nuse Nmap together with somebody\nelse we've seen, which is Nikto.\n\n32\n00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.130\nIf you remember Nikto, that was\na tool used to scan web applications.\n\n33\n00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.320\nAnd so, what we're going to do here,\nis we're going to use Nmap to actually\n\n34\n00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.420\nscan the system, and see if it's got, in\nthis case, has a web server running there.\n\n35\n00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.150\nAnd if it does,\n\n36\n00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.045\nit's going to take those results and\nfeed it over into the Nicto module.\n\n37\n00:02:07.045 --> 00:02:11.130\nSo, kind of a neat thing there to be able\nto do, because, I mean, you're probably,\n\n38\n00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.070\nif you're scanning stuff and doing stuff,\nwell, at some point, you're gonna say,\n\n39\n00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.820\nokay, I wanna take this tool and\njump over into this tool.\n\n40\n00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.800\nWell, it doesn't have to Nikto here,\nit can be another tool.\n\n41\n00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.980\nSo you can say, well if Nmap finds this,\nsend it on over to whatever.\n\n42\n00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.895\nSo in this case, I've already typed it out\nfor you to make it nice and easy on me.\n\n43\n00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:33.340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n44\n00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.940\nwhat I'll do is have everything typed in,\nI hit enter.\n\n45\n00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.750\nAnd what it does, since that 132 is\nthat Metasploitable system, it just\n\n46\n00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.140\nwent over and scanned it and says yeah\nthere's something living behind Port 80.\n\n47\n00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.830\nAnd so now what did it do?\n\n48\n00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.540\nIt fed it over into Nikto and the Nikto\nhas now picked up the ball and run with it\n\n49\n00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.910\nand it's scanning that .132 server,\nthat 132 or that Metasploitable system.\n\n50\n00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.480\nSo we're finding it, and you can see that\nit's given us some some neat stuff here,\n\n51\n00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.582\nbecause if you go down the list here,\nwhat does it say, it's right at the top.\n\n52\n00:03:09.582 --> 00:03:12.650\nIt's noticed an Apache system,\nso it's what it's picking up as,\n\n53\n00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.740\nknows there's PHP there.\n\n54\n00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.250\nIt's got, it just keeps going through,\nit's telling us as we go down the list\n\n55\n00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.310\nmore it's telling us that it's scanning\nfor some specific vulnerabilities.\n\n56\n00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.245\nThat's what Nickto is doing.\n\n57\n00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:30.560\nNikto is kind of picking up it's part of\nthe deal and said, okay we did all this.\n\n58\n00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.900\nThere we got a complete\nscan such as it is.\n\n59\n00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.510\nThat Metaloitable system isn't\na full blown website, but\n\n60\n00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.810\nit doesn't matter,\nif it's a full blown website.\n\n61\n00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.720\nThe goal here is to show you we can do\nthat, and pipe the commands over and\n\n62\n00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.540\nthat's indeed what I did.\n\n63\n00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.145\nIt went through, it just brought\nit right on over from Nmap,\n\n64\n00:03:51.145 --> 00:03:55.030\nit said found it, you go ahead and pick it\nup, and it went ahead and continued it.\n\n65\n00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.230\n>> That's extremely handy,\nif it saves me some time,\n\n66\n00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.490\ninstead of having to open up two\nseparate tools to do this job,\n\n67\n00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.120\nI can type one command in Nmap and\nend up using both tools.\n\n68\n00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.670\nNow what if I had, like with Nmap,\nI can do a range of addresses,\n\n69\n00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.950\nwould Nikto pick up all, and let's say\nthere's a hundred addresses in that range,\n\n70\n00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.310\nten of them were web servers, had port\n80 open, Nikto would scan those ten?\n\n71\n00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.530\n>> Yeah, it would find them and pass\nthose over when it got positive results.\n\n72\n00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.310\nAnd as an open port, it would start\npassing them over to Nikto and\n\n73\n00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.230\nsay you pick it up and so,\nscan for scan for scan.\n\n74\n00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.520\n>> That can definitely speed up\nour PIN testing process then.\n\n75\n00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.190\n>> Yeah.\n\n76\n00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.720\nAnd this is also the point where you\ndefinitely wanna start thinking about\n\n77\n00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.000\nstuff like the -T flag which is for\ntiming and that -D flag for decoys.\n\n78\n00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.500\nStuff like that because, yeah,\nwhat you just asked would be\n\n79\n00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.720\nthe logical next step to do,\nI mean, the logical question.\n\n80\n00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.729\nSo if you go through and you do that,\nyou do have to remember that if you scan\n\n81\n00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.703\na stuff and then Nikto comes behind and\ngrabbing that,\n\n82\n00:04:54.703 --> 00:04:58.410\nyou are generating some traffic,\nso if you just leave it like that.\n\n83\n00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.733\n>> So, now we can combine or decoy switch\nthat we learned in the previous how to,\n\n84\n00:05:02.733 --> 00:05:06.340\nwe can throw that in there and\nat least obfuscate our IP address.\n\n85\n00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.980\n>> All right, calm down.\n\n86\n00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.672\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're getting me excited here.\n\n87\n00:05:12.672 --> 00:05:14.880\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, but that way It would absolutely,\n\n88\n00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.750\nbe the next logical thing to do in this.\n\n89\n00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.980\nAnd we don't have to leave it the way\nwe did here, this was just to demo it.\n\n90\n00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.810\nYou guys looking at this now,\nshould be able to start going,\n\n91\n00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.940\nokay, I can take this and run with this.\n\n92\n00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.180\nI can see what's going on and I know it,\n\n93\n00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.490\nI know how to look up the flags and\nstart putting those in there.\n\n94\n00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.870\nYou could really customize\nthis quite a bit.\n\n95\n00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.910\nAnd you could make this so\nit's a lot more stealthy.\n\n96\n00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.890\nMaybe the results will take\na little longer to get back, but\n\n97\n00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.785\nas long as you get it back in\na reasonable time they can act on it.\n\n98\n00:05:45.785 --> 00:05:46.755\nI mean, scan the sub net.\n\n99\n00:05:46.755 --> 00:05:49.535\nAnd this is,\nif you look at the command here,\n\n100\n00:05:51.075 --> 00:05:54.665\nwhen I have it up here,\nI can show you a couple different results.\n\n101\n00:05:54.665 --> 00:05:59.780\nI did it to customize it to make\nit easier with the scan I did,\n\n102\n00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.150\nI just targeted a single IP address.\n\n103\n00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.470\nI didn't want to scan a whole range.\n\n104\n00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.800\nIt's gonna take more time than we have.\n\n105\n00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.530\n>> We don't wanna sit around and\nwatch that.\n\n106\n00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.942\nWe want to see you do it, now,\nwe want to go try it ourselves.\n\n107\n00:06:11.942 --> 00:06:14.703\n>> I don't know,\nyou're pretty excited at the moment.\n\n108\n00:06:14.703 --> 00:06:19.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In any case, you see the /24, you could\n\n109\n00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.650\ndo that, that's acceptable in Nmap, as we\nknow, you could do the same thing there.\n\n110\n00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.750\nWhen it finds one, it's going to\nstart passing over it where it\n\n111\n00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.750\ngets positive results and\nyou gotta love that.\n\n112\n00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.520\nAnd think about this too,\n\n113\n00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.420\nif you really kind of let\nyour mind work on this a bit,\n\n114\n00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:43.400\nwhat if I pulled out Nikto, and\nI dropped in one of my scripts for\n\n115\n00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.620\npassword cracking and\nsaid well what about cracking FTP.\n\n116\n00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:54.100\nI could target port 21, and\nthen it decided that Pipe put my\n\n117\n00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.710\ncommands needed for my password\ncracker for FTP, we do have those.\n\n118\n00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.490\nAnd tell it,\nevery time you find an FTP server on here,\n\n119\n00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.590\npass that right on over to this guy and\nlet him work on it.\n\n120\n00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.469\nAnd so, just let those ideas flow,\ntry it out and\n\n121\n00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:14.230\nyou've got the basics\nhere by looking at that.\n\n122\n00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:19.070\nThere's plenty more on this, so that was\na cool thing I thought I'd show you,\n\n123\n00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:24.050\nyou keep buying stuff, we take a look at\nthat, in a last little bit, of first part.\n\n124\n00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.930\nBut we still got plenty of\nthings on the menu here.\n\n125\n00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.260\nWe could keep going on and\non and on with this.\n\n126\n00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.400\n>> I'm hungry,\nI don't know about you guys out there.\n\n127\n00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.726\n>> Yeah, I'm gonna let this run and\nthen I'm gonna leave.\n\n128\n00:07:35.726 --> 00:07:38.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What you can do is,\n\n129\n00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.840\nI'm not gonna execute this command.\n\n130\n00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.530\nI did it once as you can see on here, but\nit does take a little while to do it.\n\n131\n00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.497\nIt says 11 seconds it actually\ntakes a little longer than that.\n\n132\n00:07:50.497 --> 00:07:53.908\nBut and the results aren't\nall that exciting, but, for\n\n133\n00:07:53.908 --> 00:07:58.102\nthis one because the way that it is,\nit's an Metaploitable system but\n\n134\n00:07:58.102 --> 00:08:02.506\n[COUGH] What we have here is this VNC\nbrute, what you see in here is the NMAP,\n\n135\n00:08:02.506 --> 00:08:07.950\nthe dash, dash script, and the VNC brute,\nwhich is the actual script that's running.\n\n136\n00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.530\nNow tell it target port 5900,\nand that IP address.\n\n137\n00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.790\nThat IP address is once again\nmy Meta Exploitable System.\n\n138\n00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:18.470\nSo, what's gonna happen here is the script\nis gonna run NMAP gonna start up.\n\n139\n00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:23.820\nRun that VNC Brute, which is a brute\nforcing for passwords.so, it's got\n\n140\n00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.650\nspiral that up that up and then is gonna\nsay go to port 5900 on this IP address.\n\n141\n00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.640\nAnd it'll run that script against it.\n\n142\n00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.920\nAnd it will, you know,\n\n143\n00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.770\npound on it to see if it can actually\nretrieve a password for you.\n\n144\n00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:40.610\nAnd if it finds one, it will spit it\nback at you and say here, I found it.\n\n145\n00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:46.330\nAnd there's more brute forcing scripts\nthan just that one, too, which is neat.\n\n146\n00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.830\nThere's ones for FTP, there's ones for\n\n147\n00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.300\ndoing HTTP applications if they're\npassing passwords over that.\n\n148\n00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.110\nI mean you've got a lot of them,\nand that's kind of a neat thing.\n\n149\n00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.990\nI have found that you have that\nability to do that with scripts,\n\n150\n00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:04.390\nto do password cracking in\nthe customized scripts that much.\n\n151\n00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.000\nThink about it.\n\n152\n00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.220\nThis is where it can really, one of\nthose things that can mess you up a bit.\n\n153\n00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.830\nAnd if you haven't taken your ethical\nhacking stuff yet, or you're going into\n\n154\n00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:19.220\nthat area remember NMAP for\nmost people is considered a port scanner.\n\n155\n00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.260\nAnd when they ask you on things\nlike the CEH or stuff like that.\n\n156\n00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.810\nIf you say oh no you can do this with it.\n\n157\n00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.857\nAnd most people kind of look at you\nsideways going you can do what with it.\n\n158\n00:09:29.857 --> 00:09:32.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can't crack passwords with it.\n\n159\n00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.425\nWell I beg to differ.\n\n160\n00:09:33.425 --> 00:09:36.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can do that so do remember that.\n\n161\n00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.900\nThat most people think of\nit as a port scanner and\n\n162\n00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.760\nthings revolving around that I've just\nhopefully expanded your horizons just\n\n163\n00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.500\na bit here because just through using that\nscript command I'm targeting a port and\n\n164\n00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.820\nan IP address which I could use before\nto say, hey is that port open or closed?\n\n165\n00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.330\nMost people will leave it at that.\n\n166\n00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.020\nThis, I'm saying,\nrun the script against that port.\n\n167\n00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:56.920\nAnd see what you get.\n\n168\n00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.125\nI already know that port, from doing\nother scans, is a VNC-based port.\n\n169\n00:10:01.125 --> 00:10:03.813\nIt's easy on Meta Exploitable\nstuff that told me, so\n\n170\n00:10:03.813 --> 00:10:06.330\nI didn't go through\nthe whole scanning process.\n\n171\n00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:11.100\nBut I could do the port scan and all\nthat and grab a banner out of there and\n\n172\n00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.690\nsay yeah it's VNC and then do this.\n\n173\n00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.900\nYou guys saw how to that with\nthat VNC info in part one.\n\n174\n00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.960\nSo yet you have that so that's one\nscript I want to point that out.\n\n175\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.240\nAnd I'm going to show you some\nmore stuff with scripts here.\n\n176\n00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.160\nGive you some other things\nthat are happening.\n\n177\n00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.920\nWell, here's another one, another type\nof script that we have that's available.\n\n178\n00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.450\nI'm going to show you how to get\nthe scriptures on the scripts and\n\n179\n00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:35.289\nwhere they actually are.\n\n180\n00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.230\nIn a bit here.\n\n181\n00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:42.250\nSo what we have here is we\nhave NMAP is running a script,\n\n182\n00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.940\nseeing that SNB check with volns.nse.\n\n183\n00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.320\nSo that's an NMAP scripting engine.\n\n184\n00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.630\nAnd you can see the port,\nthe p switch, that's 445.\n\n185\n00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.970\nAnd you can see, again,\nyou can see it's targeting a system.\n\n186\n00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:59.230\nIn this case, it's 138, it's a different\nsystem obviously on my subnet.\n\n187\n00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.650\nWhat this is doing is if we go\nback if you were with us for\n\n188\n00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:07.630\nour metasploit course when we\nwent through a bunch of stuff,\n\n189\n00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:12.290\nwe learned with metasploit we were\nable to find a vulnerability on an XP\n\n190\n00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:16.650\nservice back two system and\npunch in through SMB and\n\n191\n00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:21.500\nthen drop in an interpreter and start\nexecuting commands to a remote shell.\n\n192\n00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:28.660\nWell, you get asked when you look at\nsomething like that we know we can do and\n\n193\n00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.470\nyou can run this right\nout of Metasploit too.\n\n194\n00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:34.810\nRemember, you can run NMAP inside of\nMetasploit so that's a done deal.\n\n195\n00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:41.630\nSo for us, what we did when we were\nin Metasploit, we were saying we can\n\n196\n00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:46.520\nrun this exploit find that vulnerability\nand then we can do stuff with it.\n\n197\n00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.640\nI already knew it was there.\n\n198\n00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.690\nI cut out that whole frontloaded\nportion of saying let's find one.\n\n199\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.370\nSo what we're doing here in this\nparticular one is we want to find one and\n\n200\n00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:58.120\nI wanna show you, you know what\nhappens when you run this script.\n\n201\n00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.750\nSo I've got that SMBcheck script up\nthere and you can see the format of it.\n\n202\n00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:03.740\nI hit Enter.\n\n203\n00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.480\nAnd it's gonna take a moment to run.\n\n204\n00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:10.390\nIt's only running against that single IP\naddress but you could easily sweep a whole\n\n205\n00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:16.150\nsubnet and see if that scripting\nengine will find anything on there.\n\n206\n00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:21.560\nSo what's happened is it scanned\nspecifically that 445 then I go look\n\n207\n00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:27.470\ndown through the list of stuff in here and\nthat can actually start.\n\n208\n00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.520\nYou can actually tweak this\nscript a bit and see if it\n\n209\n00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.290\nrecognizes something that's there,\nor that's not there.\n\n210\n00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.900\nIn this case it ran some stuff, and\n\n211\n00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:44.650\nin this case it doesn't think\nthat Conficker is there.\n\n212\n00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:51.600\nConficker, if you remember,\nConficker is something that does\n\n213\n00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:57.010\nprey upon the same thing that SMB did, so\nit says in this case it's likely clean.\n\n214\n00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.340\nWell, it's not getting enough\nto say if it's 100%, so\n\n215\n00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:04.360\nthis would be something where at that\npoint I could use Metasploit to come\n\n216\n00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.670\nin and say let's poke at it a bit more to\nsee if I can get it to take that or not.\n\n217\n00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.530\nYou know so\nthat would be one way of doing it.\n\n218\n00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.030\nIt's not the only way you could\nfind the vulnerabilities though.\n\n219\n00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.010\nThere's other ones for\nother vulnerabilities but\n\n220\n00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.210\nwe'll get to that in a moment.\n\n221\n00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.230\nOther ones, this is an interesting one to.\n\n222\n00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.640\nThere's another script\nthat NMAP has available.\n\n223\n00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.510\nLet's say you want to find where\nan IP address actually is, okay.\n\n224\n00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.740\nI've just gone ahead and cheated because\nI know NMAP's capable of handling it.\n\n225\n00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.730\nI stuck in you know Google.\n\n226\n00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:33.280\nInto there.\n\n227\n00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.160\nOkay fine.\nYou can type in any thing\n\n228\n00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:36.700\nat the end of this.\n\n229\n00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.400\nBut you can see I have a script\nit's IP geolocation geo plugin.\n\n230\n00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.350\nIt means it's going to go through\na specific service to see it can take\n\n231\n00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:48.540\nthe IP address it gets so\nwe'll do a reverse DNS on google.com and\n\n232\n00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.830\nfeed that over into that\nIP geolocation service and\n\n233\n00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:56.860\nsee if it can detect anything that tells\nit where that IP address is located.\n\n234\n00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:01.340\nSo if I run that script,\nit takes a moment or two to do it's query.\n\n235\n00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:06.180\nAnd when it comes back, it doesn't\nnecessarily have to give me a location,\n\n236\n00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.960\nsometimes it won't because\nof various conditions, but\n\n237\n00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.640\nin most cases you'll get something back.\n\n238\n00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.160\nNow you can see here, I've run this\nscript, it queried report 80 and\n\n239\n00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.720\n433 off of that and then we look at\nthe bottom says the script results.\n\n240\n00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.545\nOkay.\nSo NMAP is the first part of that,\n\n241\n00:14:22.545 --> 00:14:23.590\ntelling me the port.\n\n242\n00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:27.150\nSecond part is the script itself,\nspitting the results back.\n\n243\n00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.170\nSo it's got the IP address in there.\n\n244\n00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.305\nIt's got the Latin longs on there of it.\n\n245\n00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:32.968\nJust in case you needed that.\n\n246\n00:14:32.968 --> 00:14:35.905\n[LAUGH] It's got the Latin\nlongs it's a state, California.\n\n247\n00:14:37.635 --> 00:14:39.305\nCalifornia is Latin for confused.\n\n248\n00:14:39.305 --> 00:14:42.105\n[LAUGH] So I can understand the confusion.\n\n249\n00:14:42.105 --> 00:14:48.040\n>> And Latin longs for our non viewers\nthat might not know what it means.\n\n250\n00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:48.630\n>> Yeah, look it up.\n\n251\n00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.760\nThat's what I would tell you what to do.\n\n252\n00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.556\n>> Latitude and longitude, right?\n[CROSSTALK] >> Yeah,\n\n253\n00:14:51.556 --> 00:14:53.480\nit's coordinate system.\n\n254\n00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.130\nYeah.\nSo you can go through and look at that,\n\n255\n00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.550\nif you're not familiar with those.\n\n256\n00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:01.050\nYeah, they're just lines crossing on\na map, telling you where you are.\n\n257\n00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:04.720\n>> So,\nnarrowing down that location pretty close.\n\n258\n00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.960\nYeah, it will get it pretty close\nas to where that IP address is.\n\n259\n00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.740\nThat may not be ultimately\nwhere the actual server is,\n\n260\n00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.570\nsometimes that occurs\nbecause of knatting and\n\n261\n00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:20.650\nthose little tricks that they do,\nbut it can get pretty close.\n\n262\n00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:23.830\nI found that it's pretty\ndecent at doing this.\n\n263\n00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:27.430\nSo that's kind of another script,\nI kind of want to show you some of\n\n264\n00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:30.850\nthe flexibility this has and\nthings that people have provided.\n\n265\n00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:34.348\n>> That is pretty impressive cuz when you\nthink about it it's running, it's doing\n\n266\n00:15:34.348 --> 00:15:37.588\nits job, taking that information Feeding\nand another one reaching out and\n\n267\n00:15:37.588 --> 00:15:41.291\nhitting some service out there on the web\nI'm presuming, oh that's right, because\n\n268\n00:15:41.291 --> 00:15:44.995\nyou're not running the geolocation service\nor anything in house, so it's reaching\n\n269\n00:15:44.995 --> 00:15:48.729\nout, sending information out, getting it\nback, and then reporting it back to you.\n\n270\n00:15:48.729 --> 00:15:52.980\n>> Yeah, it is really impressive and\na neat thing when you think about it.\n\n271\n00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.002\nAll of these things are happening.\n\n272\n00:15:54.002 --> 00:16:00.560\nWithout you having to really lift\na finger, so I just love it.\n\n273\n00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:06.380\nSo then this last script I'll put up here,\nI'm not\n\n274\n00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:11.180\ngonna really mess around with writing this\none, cuz this one will take a while to run\n\n275\n00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:15.850\nbecause there is an FTP server at that IP\naddress, it's my Metasploitable system.\n\n276\n00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:20.310\nAnd what's happening here, first of all\nit's running that script in the middle.\n\n277\n00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.640\nYou kind of know the stuff around it,\nyou should recognize the stuff around it.\n\n278\n00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.950\nThe dash p, it's going out form port 21,\nso FTP port and IP address,\n\n279\n00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:29.670\nwe know where that is.\n\n280\n00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.570\nBut that script is telling it to do\na brute force attack against that\n\n281\n00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:36.310\nFTP server, so\nyou told it that it's there and\n\n282\n00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:40.070\nwhat it's gonna do is it's gonna keep\nrunning it, see if it can break it.\n\n283\n00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:44.280\nBrute forces do take a while which is why\nI'm not [LAUGH] going to sit here and\n\n284\n00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.110\nrun and run for it.\n\n285\n00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.675\nI don't want like a three hour program.\n\n286\n00:16:46.675 --> 00:16:50.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And these guys don't either.\n\n287\n00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.000\nYou know, so.\n\n288\n00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.770\nAnyway, that's what that does.\n\n289\n00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:00.280\nLet me kind of answer a few questions\nthat might be going through your head at\n\n290\n00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.760\nthis point.\n\n291\n00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.470\nHow do I know what scripts to run and\nwhere do I get these scripts and\n\n292\n00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:10.970\nhow do I get the stuff,\nthe same thing, going?\n\n293\n00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:11.695\nThat's part three.\n\n294\n00:17:11.695 --> 00:17:15.232\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just leave.\n\n295\n00:17:15.232 --> 00:17:20.490\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> So let me show you just by going\n\n296\n00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:26.750\nover here to, this is nmap.org,\nthis is the documentation for\n\n297\n00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.890\nNmap and yeah Mike's put\nthe URL up there for you, and\n\n298\n00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:38.590\nI really strongly encourage you\nthat just for your own benefit.\n\n299\n00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.390\nI know a lot of you may just be using this\nas a port scanner or you're doing it for\n\n300\n00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.850\nthe ethical hacker or what have you.\n\n301\n00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.420\nThere's really a lot of stuff waiting\nin end map for you to unlock, and\n\n302\n00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:56.690\nhopefully for me showing you this is\nreally illustrating that very fact,\n\n303\n00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:00.980\nthat there's a lot there waiting for\nyou underneath the surface that you just\n\n304\n00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:06.680\ngotta be willing to dig in and\nspend some time with it.\n\n305\n00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:12.610\nWhat we have here in this\ndocumentation is they have\n\n306\n00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:17.800\na ton of scripts included\nwith Nmap that people have\n\n307\n00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:23.780\nbeen provided rather with the product and\nso you can go through this and\n\n308\n00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:27.516\nthere's 500 some odd scripts as they\nhappen here for just about everything.\n\n309\n00:18:27.516 --> 00:18:31.070\nSo what this means is when you look\nat some of these sayings as they look\n\n310\n00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:32.530\nat categories.\n\n311\n00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:36.530\nChecking, authentication,\nsystems, we've got.\n\n312\n00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:41.530\nWe have things to do with tax in there,\nthings to do with password\n\n313\n00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:45.760\ncracking in there, things to look for\nexploits, fuzzing.\n\n314\n00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.860\nI mean, heck, fuzzing's a whole\ndifferent category of stuff.\n\n315\n00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.550\nRight?\nI mean, we just We spent time in the class\n\n316\n00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:52.230\ntalking about that.\n\n317\n00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.730\nWe spent time in ethical\nhacking talking about that.\n\n318\n00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:57.610\nA couple of other places\ntalking about that.\n\n319\n00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:58.440\nThey make it sound like, \"Oh,\n\n320\n00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.810\nthat's a different tool.\"\nNmap's great if you found it.\n\n321\n00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:02.360\nGood job.\n\n322\n00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.650\nLet's move on to another\nclass tool that does it.\n\n323\n00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:07.210\nWell I'm not gonna say Nmap's\ngonna be able to do it the same\n\n324\n00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.680\nrobust level that some of\nthese other tools will.\n\n325\n00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:14.060\nIt can actually start that process so\nthat if you look at the fuzzing\n\n326\n00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.290\nof part of it, it's not just fuzzing\nnecessarily against applications,\n\n327\n00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:20.650\nit could do it against other stuff.\n\n328\n00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:22.510\nYou can see it has these there in here.\n\n329\n00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:27.150\nIt can do fuzzing against DNS to see\nwhat it can find against, to see\n\n330\n00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:31.130\nwhat type of attack it can find against\nthat, or see what's going on with DNS.\n\n331\n00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:36.210\nIt can do stuff with web sites,\nthe forms on web site.\n\n332\n00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:40.160\nAnd then it even has this one where\nit can look use fuzzing to find PHP\n\n333\n00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:40.930\npages in there.\n\n334\n00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:41.710\nSo.\n\n335\n00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:47.000\nIt could do a tremendous\namount of stuff for\n\n336\n00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.100\nyou, that you may not even\nhave to move to another one.\n\n337\n00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:53.290\nYou know, there's BitCoin, stuff for\ntargeting BitCoin stuff if you have those,\n\n338\n00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:56.910\nI mean, there's all levels of it.\n\n339\n00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:01.180\nI mean I don't even know specifically when\nI look at this, when I'm talking about it,\n\n340\n00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:05.310\nI don't even know which ones to point\nout to you as being hey these are cool,\n\n341\n00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.780\nbecause to me they're all cool.\n\n342\n00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:11.050\nThere's just such a broad\nnumber of them in here.\n\n343\n00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:16.040\nSo I would definitely tell you, you really\nshould take a look at these things and\n\n344\n00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:21.330\nsee which ones can help you and which ones\nmight be something that you can file away.\n\n345\n00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.550\nWho knows, you might be doing that pen\ntest at some point in the future and\n\n346\n00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:27.050\nyou're thinking about,\nwell how would I accomplish this?\n\n347\n00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:27.949\nAnd all of a sudden, [SOUND] hey Nmap.\n\n348\n00:20:27.949 --> 00:20:29.668\nI've got something that will do that.\n\n349\n00:20:29.668 --> 00:20:34.244\nAnd who knows, maybe you're in that\nsituation where you would like to do\n\n350\n00:20:34.244 --> 00:20:38.370\nsomething As part of your PIN test but\nyou didn't bring that you or\n\n351\n00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:43.645\nyou can't get it installed or\nyou can't run it for whatever reason.\n\n352\n00:20:43.645 --> 00:20:46.585\nNmap can do this for you too.\n\n353\n00:20:46.585 --> 00:20:50.360\nNmap can go ahead and do a lot of these\nthings or at least get you started.\n\n354\n00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.700\nMaybe they're crude compared to\nthe other tools in some cases but\n\n355\n00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.800\nthey will at least get you going.\n\n356\n00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:02.860\nSo I just love the variation of stuff\n\n357\n00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:08.490\nthat you have here, scripts and\nthe power they can give you, I mean, so.\n\n358\n00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.010\n>> It's an amazingly long list there.\n\n359\n00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.540\n>> Yeah, I mean 500 plus scripts.\n\n360\n00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:20.890\nThat's just the stuff that ships\nwith the product, by the way.\n\n361\n00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:26.240\nIf you look at Nmap,\n\n362\n00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.400\nwhat I have right here,\nthis is the My Computer.\n\n363\n00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.460\nThis is the My Program Files.\n\n364\n00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.390\nNmap and scripts.\n\n365\n00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.130\nThese are all the scripts that are sitting\n\n366\n00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:39.910\nup on...I just was going over\nthe list up on Nmap.org.\n\n367\n00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.500\nThese are all included with the product.\n\n368\n00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.570\nSo they've got the documentation up there,\nbut\n\n369\n00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:51.260\nthey have them sitting over\non your system already.\n\n370\n00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:54.150\nIf you wanna drop additional ones in,\nyou can.\n\n371\n00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:55.370\nYou can write your own.\n\n372\n00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:56.790\nThe whole language is document.\n\n373\n00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:00.280\nThe guy that developed Nmap and\n\n374\n00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.310\nstill develops Nmap, the scripting engine,\nhe's got it all documented.\n\n375\n00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:06.440\nHe goes, this is the format you go in\nthere's a pretty robust community on that,\n\n376\n00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.690\nso you could go someplace else and\nfind someone else's script and say oh,\n\n377\n00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:10.880\nwell heck, I can use that.\n\n378\n00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.210\nOr maybe I'm going to write my own and\nget Nmap to go through this and run it so\n\n379\n00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.370\nit scripting engine to do the stuff\nthat I want it to do more than just\n\n380\n00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:19.780\nthose things it can do.\n\n381\n00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.400\nIt's going to give me another way\nof manipulating all this stuff, and\n\n382\n00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:28.610\nit's got a pretty rich API, so you could\ndo just a tremendous amount of stuff.\n\n383\n00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.030\nIt just requires you to want to do it.\n\n384\n00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:32.200\nThat's really it.\n\n385\n00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:36.130\nI mean it's a staggering amount\nof power underneath the hood\n\n386\n00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:42.730\njust by using the switches that are there\nbut then you start using the switches plus\n\n387\n00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:47.810\nstuff like scripts and I'm just gonna\nsay there's an infinite number of\n\n388\n00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:51.570\ncombinations of these things you can use\nto get all sorts of results I mean heck,\n\n389\n00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.810\nyou've got the switches\nyou've got the scripts and\n\n390\n00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:56.950\nthen that's where you get a heck of\na lot of things you can do there.\n\n391\n00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:58.020\nWhat's the next thing?\n\n392\n00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:01.310\nGrabbing in an outside application and\nhaving Nmaps scan for\n\n393\n00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.460\nthe stuff and query and\nlook for this thing.\n\n394\n00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.660\nAnd once it's got that hey guess what I've\ngot something for you to do and hands it\n\n395\n00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:11.150\noff to whatever that external application\nis and it processes it even further.\n\n396\n00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:17.300\nSo it's just a great thing\nto have in your tool kit.\n\n397\n00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.260\n>> All right, ladies and gentlemen\nsome more tips and tricks from Sean.\n\n398\n00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.355\nStay tune for more, coming your way.\n\n399\n00:23:24.355 --> 00:23:29.430\n[SOUND]\n\n",
