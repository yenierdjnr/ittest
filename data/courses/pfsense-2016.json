  "description": "The pfSense show is presented to help users to become familiar and proficient at deploying the free network firewall.  This free solution provides the features found in most commercial firewalls and even some features not found in some of them.  It is completely scalable only limited by the hardware you provide.  To make for easier management and configuration, a full featured and intuitive web-based configurator is integrated to support all features.  You’ll see that it’s relatively easy to get it functional.  The show also shows how to implement firewall filters, nat rules, network services, VPNs and additional packages.",

Well, when we start taking a look\nat the idea of implementing pfSense,\n\n7\n00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.540\nit's one of the most popular pieces\nof software that's out there.\n\n8\n00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.200\nFor us, we're implementing firewalls.\n\n9\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.291\nDon't get me wrong,\n\n10\n00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:31.927\nthere's a bunch of solutions that\nare out there that we can pay for, but\n\n11\n00:00:31.927 --> 00:00:36.440\npfSense gives us the enterprise solutions\nthat we all really do want and need.\n\n12\n00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.750\nReally at a incredibly budgeted cost, but\nsuper high performance at the same time.\n\n13\n00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.650\nSo in our show, we of course are going\nto begin by taking a look at how we\n\n14\n00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.810\ninstall pfSense and\nwhere we get the pfSense ISO from,\n\n15\n00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.670\nso that we can begin our installation and\nthe configuration.\n\n16\n00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.600\nThe basic configuration, of course,\nreally is kind of the key to get it up and\n\n17\n00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.900\nrunning and most of the time you can even\nbring pfSense up within 20 or 30 minutes.\n\n18\n00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.150\nGet it up, operation, at that point we'll\ntake a look at multiple configurations.\n\n19\n00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.760\nWhen we start talking about the\nconfiguration there's gonna be multiple\n\n20\n00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.850\ntabs that are inside of pfSense, and\nwe will hit every single one of them,\n\n21\n00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.750\nnot showing every single option in\nthe most in depth dive that we can do.\n\n22\n00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.100\nBut, at least,\nfamiliarity in getting around pfSense, and\n\n23\n00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.880\nensuring that we can configure, kind of,\nthe basic things such as, of course,\n\n24\n00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.670\ninstalling things like packages,\nconfiguring high availability and\n\n25\n00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.990\nfailover are also key that we can do.\n\n26\n00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.810\nWe're also of course going to be\nsetting up different firewall rules and\n\n27\n00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.640\nconfiguring that inside of pfSense, as\n\n28\n00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.360\nwell as using some virtual interfaces to\nhelp us when we set up high availability.\n\n29\n00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.940\nWe're going to end up seeing as well,\nthe ability to configure for\n\n30\n00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.450\ncaptive portal, if we want to, so\n\n31\n00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.550\nthat we can have some type of stop before\nsomebody connects out to the Internet.\n\n32\n00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.720\nWe might see this more often in\nsomething like a coffeehouse\n\n33\n00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.150\nof some sort where they say hey, make sure\nyou click here before you can get out.\n\n34\n00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.350\nThat you have to read\nthe agreements that you need.\n\n35\n00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.430\nAs well as DHCP and DNS, and of course,\n\n36\n00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.180\nthere's other things that\nare out there such as VPNs.\n\n37\n00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.330\nWe'll show you how configure\na site-to-site VPN using Open VPN,\n\n38\n00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.730\nas well as IPSec and remote access VPN.\n\n39\n00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.510\nAnd lastly, we'll also end up taking\na look at, well multiple tools that\n\n40\n00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.110\nare available to help us to monitor and\nto ensure that we can see some of\n\n41\n00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.660\nthe diagnostic tools that are available,\nthat are built right into pfSense.\n\n42\n00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.210\nAll of these are actually nice features\nthat really requires a little bit of\n\n43\n00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.810\nattention but once you start to use it,\nyou'll see how intuitive it is and\n\n44\n00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.820\nhow easy it really is to configure\nsome of those technical configurations\n\n45\n00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.450\nthat might take you a long time\nto learn like a Cisco ASA.\n\n46\n00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.890\nIt will only take you a little bit of\ntime to learn and its very intuitive\n\n47\n00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.090\ninterface will ask you make it much\neasier and easier to troubleshoot.\n\n48\n00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.785\nThere's a lot of fun to be had there, so\n\n49\n00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:17.133\nget ready as you actually take\na look into PSsense 2.3.2.\n\n50\n00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:19.700\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie, you threw a lot\nof technical jargon at us there.\n\n51\n00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.640\nSo, I'm guessing there is an intended\naudience, or maybe even a foundation\n\n52\n00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.760\nof knowledge that someone might have that\nwould go along with this series, as well.\n\n53\n00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.840\n&gt;&gt; Like anything else, you do need to\nhave a bit of networking knowledge\n\n54\n00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.800\nbehind getting a pfSense box set up.\n\n55\n00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.030\nIf you're using this with an Internet\nconnection, you do need to understand\n\n56\n00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.520\nhow to assign those public IP addresses,\na little bit of subnetting.\n\n57\n00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.920\nAnd then, of course, connecting into\nthings like switches if you need to.\n\n58\n00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.640\nAlong the way, too, that would be helpful,\n\n59\n00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.410\nis having a logical understanding\nof setting up access control list,\n\n60\n00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.210\nor firewall rules, and understanding the\norder of importance that you might have.\n\n61\n00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.340\nHaving familiarity,\nof course, with just basic\n\n62\n00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.510\nVPN concepts will get you at least started\nand established in what we can do.\n\n63\n00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.150\nAnd then in monitoring it is about\nlearning how to troubleshoot.\n\n64\n00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.010\nSome of the major issues that\nwe can see from the pfSense box.\n\n65\n00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.560\nSo if this is inside of your wheelhouse,\nall of the information that we're about\n\n66\n00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.540\nto talk about here in our series, you're\ngonna see that we'll cover those things.\n\n67\n00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.280\nBut using, of course, the pfSense\ninterface to help us to do that.\n\n68\n00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.030\nThe great thing,\n\n69\n00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.320\nonce again, is that we'll show you step\nby step how to configure a lot of this.\n\n70\n00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.170\nEven if we don't go into\nthe most technical aspects of it,\n\n71\n00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.100\nyou'll at least feel familiar enough\nto know where you can do a little\n\n72\n00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.090\nbit of researching of this is exactly\nwhat I need and that should help you out.\n\n73\n00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.200\nSo we'll be covering that pretty\nmuch in depth and you'll get a good\n\n74\n00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.170\nsense of how the pfSense firewall\n2.3.2 works in reality unless you used\n\n75\n00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.820\na lot of scenarios in which we've\nalso set up right here at ITProTV.\n\n76\n00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.570\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Ronnie, thank you so\nmuch for that great information.\n\n77\n00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.964\nNow, if that's sounds like something\nthat's interesting to you, and\n\n78\n00:05:02.964 --> 00:05:05.532\nwe look forward to seeing\nwith in the upcoming series.\n\n79\n00:05:05.532 --> 00:05:08.914\n[SOUND]\n\n",
