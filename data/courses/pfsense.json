          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:06.022\n[SOUND] Welcome to the ITProTV\n\n2\n00:00:06.022 --> 00:00:12.040\npfSense Text Skill series.\n\n3\n00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.180\nIn this series of episodes, we're gonna\nbe taking a look at the pfSense firewall.\n\n4\n00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.190\nAnd how we can implement that\nin our homes and businesses.\n\n5\n00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.780\nAnd really get a lot of great\nfunctionality out of a firewall system.\n\n6\n00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.810\nThat is feature by feature,\na great competitor with the big\n\n7\n00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.350\ncommercial vendors out there like\nCisco and Juniper and those guys.\n\n8\n00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.130\n>> The nice thing about the pfSense\nfirewall is really for the open-source\n\n9\n00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.480\ncrowd and for everybody else that's\ntrying to look for all the features.\n\n10\n00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.360\nBut you don't want to keep adding in and\nspending more and more money.\n\n11\n00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.750\nYou gonna see that pfSense\nreally is a way to go and\n\n12\n00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.655\nreally a nice feature set for us.\n\n13\n00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:48.690\n>> Ronnie, I know you've bumped into this,\nI bumped into it to where\n\n14\n00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.190\nyou go to a business and\nyou start implementing a Cisco ASA.\n\n15\n00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.070\nAnd then you find some feature you\nwanna use and you're like oh shoot,\n\n16\n00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.640\nI've gotta upgrade to the 50 user license.\n\n17\n00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.330\nOr the unlimited user license,\n\n18\n00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.250\nor the security plus license just to\nget more than two interfaces working.\n\n19\n00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.785\nAnd it's really frustrating and\nreally expensive.\n\n20\n00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:08.268\nPfSense on the other hand,\n\n21\n00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:12.800\nopen-source firewall part if you\ndownload it free from their website.\n\n22\n00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.380\nAnd all of it's functionality\nworks out of the box.\n\n23\n00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.570\nThat's the way they make money,\nis they make money off of support tickets.\n\n24\n00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.710\nIf you want commercial support\nfrom pfSense [INAUDIBLE],\n\n25\n00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.540\ncall them on the phone and\nthey help you out.\n\n26\n00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.810\nWell, you have to pay for that.\n\n27\n00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.016\nBut if you want community support and\nto set it up yourself,\n\n28\n00:01:28.016 --> 00:01:29.694\nthey don't charge you a dime.\n\n29\n00:01:29.694 --> 00:01:33.370\nIt doesn't matter if you have 1 user or\n10,000 users, they don't care.\n\n30\n00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.490\nIt will flow right through.\n\n31\n00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.040\nIt is a great firewall system.\n\n32\n00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.650\nI've used it in a number of locations.\n\n33\n00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.580\nRon, you use it too.\n\n34\n00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.320\n>> I do, yeah.\n\n35\n00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.248\nI've used it in a couple of\ndifferent locations that really,\n\n36\n00:01:42.248 --> 00:01:44.969\nit made more sense to go with\nthe features that we needed.\n\n37\n00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.520\nAnd so, I'm only willing to spend this\nmuch amount of money to be able to do so.\n\n38\n00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.485\nAnd I said, well you're actually taking\na look at doing a Cisco firewall.\n\n39\n00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:54.950\nAnd you're gonna have to do exactly\nwhat Don was talking about.\n\n40\n00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.380\nYou keep upgrading,\nall of a sudden they're like,\n\n41\n00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.128\nthat's a little bit out\nof our price range.\n\n42\n00:01:58.128 --> 00:01:59.320\nRecommending a pfSense and\n\n43\n00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.490\nsaying hey, as long as you have\na computer that can pretty much run it.\n\n44\n00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.120\nWe can actually go ahead and implement\nthis and have a full feature firewall set.\n\n45\n00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.340\n>> A couple of neat features about pfSense\nthat will make you want to choose it as\n\n46\n00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.410\na firewall.\n\n47\n00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.460\nIt is free right?\n\n48\n00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.310\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n49\n00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.740\n>> A big one\n>> It runs on top of FreeBSD, which is\n\n50\n00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.090\na Unix-based operating system that's\ndesigned to run on standard hardware.\n\n51\n00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.270\nSo if you wanna buy a firewall appliance,\n\n52\n00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.210\nsomething as dedicated as a firewall,\nyou can.\n\n53\n00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.560\nAnd you can buy them with pfSense on them.\n\n54\n00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.300\nOr if you want, you can just take\na regular PC, a server, a one use server.\n\n55\n00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.050\nOr even a desktop, you have laying around.\n\n56\n00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.960\nI've done it on old laptops before.\n\n57\n00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.430\nAnd you can throw pfSense right on there,\ncuz it supports standard hardware.\n\n58\n00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.140\n64-bit and 32-bit,\nyou can throw it on there.\n\n59\n00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.090\nIt's really pretty flexible for\nthat and that's something that's nice.\n\n60\n00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.930\nAnother nice feature is\nthe web-based user interface, right?\n\n61\n00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.732\nWe keep singling out Cisco,\nwhich I feel a little bad about it.\n\n62\n00:02:53.732 --> 00:02:55.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz Cisco does make great equipment.\n\n63\n00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.870\nBut if you wanna manage a Cisco firewall,\nyou've either got the command-line.\n\n64\n00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.816\nOr you've got their Java standalone\ninterface for which is really unpleasant.\n\n65\n00:03:04.816 --> 00:03:07.030\nI mean, just running Java is unpleasant.\n\n66\n00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.380\nWith pfSense, it's just a webpage.\n\n67\n00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.280\nBrowse this webpage,\nyou punch in your config.\n\n68\n00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.810\nYou do have the command-line also,\nif you wanna go that route.\n\n69\n00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.270\nIt's very flexible,\nlots of possibilities in there.\n\n70\n00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.100\nIt's a great solution.\n\n71\n00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.470\n>> Unlike [LAUGH], again picking on Cisco,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n72\n00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.120\n>> A little bit, but\n\n73\n00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.300\nunlike setting up that\ninitial Cisco firewall,\n\n74\n00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.084\nbeing able to just install the pfSense.\n\n75\n00:03:27.084 --> 00:03:29.750\nAnd then at the very end once\nit's installed, it says, hey,\n\n76\n00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.970\nthis is how you connect and\nbegin to configure it.\n\n77\n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.140\nYou can have the pfSense\nfirewall actually up and\n\n78\n00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.600\nrunning, probably within half an hour.\n\n79\n00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.310\n>> Easy.\n>> And now you're actually just\n\n80\n00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.710\ntweaking all your settings.\n\n81\n00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.780\nAnd so the ease of usage,\nthe ability for someone to say,\n\n82\n00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.730\nall right,\nI can feel comfortable with this.\n\n83\n00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.770\nIt's incredibly easy in pfSense.\n\n84\n00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.120\n>> All right, so\nwhat are we gonna cover in this series?\n\n85\n00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.120\nWell, if you stay tuned to\nwatch our pfSense series.\n\n86\n00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.552\nWe're gonna show how to get a copy of\npfSense, how to install it on hardware.\n\n87\n00:03:55.552 --> 00:03:57.520\nCuz there's are a couple of\ndifferent methods you can go.\n\n88\n00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.340\nWe'll walk through each of\nthe different ways to get it installed.\n\n89\n00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.420\nAnd then once it's up and running,\n\n90\n00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.290\nwe're gonna run through\nsome basic routing setup.\n\n91\n00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.340\nWe'll show how to do\nfirewall filter rules.\n\n92\n00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.110\nCuz it is a firewall,\nyou probably wanna do that.\n\n93\n00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.320\nWe'll also take a look at Network adress\ntranslation, which is pretty important,\n\n94\n00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.970\nas well as port forwarding.\n\n95\n00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.335\nAnd we're gonna take a look at VPN setups.\n\n96\n00:04:16.335 --> 00:04:19.030\nSite-to-site VPNs for connecting offices,\n\n97\n00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.510\nas well as just regular remote access\nVPNs to allow your traveling users.\n\n98\n00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.620\nYour people that are out in the field\nto be able to connect back in and\n\n99\n00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.930\nwork with the system.\n\n100\n00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.970\nIt's all functionality that's\nbaked right into pfSense.\n\n101\n00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.190\nTowards the end of the series,\n\n102\n00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.250\nwe're gonna take a look at some of\nthe packages we can install in pfSense.\n\n103\n00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.370\nNow this is something that sets\npfSense aside from other firewalls.\n\n104\n00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.130\nThe packages, it's third-party\nsoftware that we can load and\n\n105\n00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.870\nrun right from our firewall.\n\n106\n00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.760\nAnd there's a wide range of\npackages that are out there.\n\n107\n00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.685\nFrom advanced reporting services,\nto proxy and web filtering services.\n\n108\n00:04:51.685 --> 00:04:54.560\nThere's all sorts of\nneat little gadgets and\n\n109\n00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.150\nstuff that you can install there to make\nyour firewall do some really cool stuff.\n\n110\n00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.540\nThat you normally would have\nto have a separate device for.\n\n111\n00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.910\nHere we can kind of wrap it all together.\n\n112\n00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.230\nSo a lot of different choices,\na lot of different flexibility.\n\n113\n00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.107\nIt's a great system to use.\n\n114\n00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:10.786\nSo definitely something that\nyou'll wanna check out,\n\n115\n00:05:10.786 --> 00:05:12.500\nif that sounds interesting to you.\n\n116\n00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.670\nSounds like something you wanna learn more\nabout, then you're in the right place.\n\n117\n00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.160\nStay tuned cuz we've got our\npfSense series coming up.\n\n118\n00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.890\nIf you're a die hard Cisco fan and that's\nthe route you wanna go or Juniper or\n\n119\n00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:23.850\nthe other guys.\n\n120\n00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.230\nWell, the concepts that we cover\nover these next several episodes,\n\n121\n00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.940\nthey really apply to any firewall, right?\n\n122\n00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.070\nAll the firewalls basically work the same.\n\n123\n00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.540\nIt's just the implementation is different.\n\n124\n00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.290\nThe commands, the web interface.\n\n125\n00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.140\nBut remember at ITProTV, you have access\nto the whole library with your account.\n\n126\n00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.280\nSo you can jump over to the Cisco\nshows and check those out.\n\n127\n00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.710\nOr whatever other resource it\nis that you wanna use there.\n\n128\n00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.430\nBut if you wanna learn about pfSense,\nyou're in the right place.\n\n129\n00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.176\nStay tuned,\nwe've got pfSense episodes coming up.\n\n130\n00:05:49.176 --> 00:05:55.539\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n",
