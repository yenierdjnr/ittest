00:00:17.420\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.947\nAnd today we're doing\nAdobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:19.947 --> 00:00:23.917\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna be taking a look at the user\n\n6\n00:00:23.917 --> 00:00:24.640\ninterface.\n\n7\n00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.013\nAn important part of learning any\napplication, especially one that can be as\n\n8\n00:00:29.013 --> 00:00:32.390\ncomplex as this is to learn\nyour way around that interface.\n\n9\n00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.420\nAnd here to help us with that is Ms.\nKara Page.\n\n10\n00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.330\nHow you doing, Kara?\n\n11\n00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.070\nI'm great, are you ready to get started?\n\n12\n00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.602\n>> I am.\n\n13\n00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:43.050\n>> All right, so go ahead and\nopen up Photoshop on your end, okay?\n\n14\n00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.590\nSo let's make sure that it's up and\nrunning.\n\n15\n00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.680\nIt should look very similar to my screen.\n\n16\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.490\nSo when you open up CC 2015, it defaults\nto this screen where it shows you\n\n17\n00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.020\nrecent files, libraries,\npresets, and that's\n\n18\n00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.320\nreally helpful once you've been using\nPhotoshop cuz that's where your files are.\n\n19\n00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.350\nSo if you wanna pull up a recent\nfile it's there for you.\n\n20\n00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.192\nIf you've never used Photoshop before,\nthat doesn't help you very much.\n\n21\n00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:08.430\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.147\n>> So what we're going to do, just so\n\n23\n00:01:10.147 --> 00:01:14.020\nyou can see the entire workspace, is we\nare going to click on this New button.\n\n24\n00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.690\nSo it says New...\n\n25\n00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.540\nI'm going to click on it and\nit pulls up this Preferences window.\n\n26\n00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.580\nI'm just going to select\ndocument type US Paper.\n\n27\n00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.550\nThat's probably what yours\nis defaulted to as well.\n\n28\n00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.611\nIf it's not, just click on this dropdown\nhere and select US Paper, okay.\n\n29\n00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:34.480\nAnd then go ahead and click OK.\n\n30\n00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.355\nAnd now we have our workspace\nup in it's full glory.\n\n31\n00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:38.294\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n32\n00:01:38.294 --> 00:01:41.246\nwhat we're going to do is we're\ngonna take a tour of Photoshop.\n\n33\n00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:44.970\nSo we're not gonna be learning\nthe tools or the real intricacies.\n\n34\n00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.680\nWe're learning a road map\non how to use Photoshop.\n\n35\n00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.120\nSo, let's go ahead and get started and\n\n36\n00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.900\ntalk about what these top words\nare here at the top of your screen.\n\n37\n00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.140\nThese are your file options,\nyour main toolbar here, okay.\n\n38\n00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.750\nSo it's your main menu.\n\n39\n00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.570\nIf you're on a Mac versus a PC it's\ngoing to look slightly different.\n\n40\n00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.618\nDon't worry, they both have the same\ncapabilities, just certain tools or\n\n41\n00:02:09.618 --> 00:02:12.413\ncertain options are hidden\nunder a different menu.\n\n42\n00:02:12.413 --> 00:02:15.362\n>> Of course,\nmake it a little more complex for us.\n\n43\n00:02:15.362 --> 00:02:18.313\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes, yes, so if you're on a Mac you'll\n\n44\n00:02:18.313 --> 00:02:23.810\nhave this Photoshop CC here, with options\nlike Preferences, Services and things.\n\n45\n00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.530\nThis Preferences option,\nif you are on a PC,\n\n46\n00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.230\nis actually hidden under your Edit menu.\n\n47\n00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.970\nThat's one of the main differences here.\n\n48\n00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.520\nSo under this Photoshop CC menu,\n\n49\n00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.540\nyou can learn about your version of CC,\nwhat updated version you're on.\n\n50\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.905\nYou can learn about your\nplugins if you're interested.\n\n51\n00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:46.310\n[LAUGH] You can pull up your preferences,\nwhich is really, really helpful.\n\n52\n00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.190\nSo your preferences sets everything from\nwhat color you want your screen to be,\n\n53\n00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.790\nto your units and rulers,\n\n54\n00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.990\nwhether you want them to be in\nsomething called pixels or inches.\n\n55\n00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.920\nYou can set your export options.\n\n56\n00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.720\nIt's all available for you here under this\nPhotoshop CC menu, or Edit Preferences,\n\n57\n00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.750\ndepending on where you are.\n\n58\n00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.810\nYou can also quit Photoshop\nfrom here as well.\n\n59\n00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.160\nSo if you're trying to close it out and\n\n60\n00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.610\nyou don't have that X like you do on\na Windows, you can quit it from this menu.\n\n61\n00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.150\nLet's go into File, and I'm gonna go\nahead and zoom into this a little bit, so\n\n62\n00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.510\nyou can really see this.\n\n63\n00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.260\nSo this File menu is pretty helpful for\n\n64\n00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.590\nyou cuz this is where you're going to go\nwhen you want to create a new document,\n\n65\n00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.025\nopen an existing document, or place\na document into your current document.\n\n66\n00:03:31.025 --> 00:03:33.920\nSo this File > New button right here,\n\n67\n00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.655\nthat is what we would do if\nwe want a blank work space.\n\n68\n00:03:36.655 --> 00:03:38.360\nIt's what we did just a minute ago.\n\n69\n00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.374\nSo we have this nice white sheet of paper,\n\n70\n00:03:40.374 --> 00:03:43.783\nit's like you took it out of your\nnotebook and put it on your computer.\n\n71\n00:03:43.783 --> 00:03:45.607\nThat's what you do if\nyou go to File > New.\n\n72\n00:03:45.607 --> 00:03:49.930\nFile > Open is if you\nhave an existing file.\n\n73\n00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.870\nSo let's say that you have a photo\nof you on vacation with your family,\n\n74\n00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.850\nyou wanna open it up, do some photo edits\nto it, you would go to your Open option.\n\n75\n00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.870\nBrowse and Bridge, Browse and\nBridge is this cool little way for\n\n76\n00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.900\nyou to look at your files.\n\n77\n00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.430\nSo Adobe has this program called Bridge,\n\n78\n00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.680\nessentially it's an advanced finder for\nyou.\n\n79\n00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.172\nSo if you are a photographer and\nyou're taking 200 pictures at a wedding,\n\n80\n00:04:15.172 --> 00:04:19.249\nyou're probably going to want to\nbrowse and bridge as an easier way for\n\n81\n00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:22.151\nyou to find the specific\nfiles you're looking for\n\n82\n00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:25.357\ninstead of seeing a file\nname like DC1258376.\n\n83\n00:04:25.357 --> 00:04:26.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's not really helpful to you.\n\n84\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.420\nSo Browse and\nBridge might be a good option for you.\n\n85\n00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.460\nYou can also open as a Smart Object.\n\n86\n00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.370\nSo a Smart Object would be maybe something\nthat you've created in another program\n\n87\n00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.420\nlike Illustrator.\n\n88\n00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.210\nIf you want to open up a logo,\nyou can open it as a Smart Object.\n\n89\n00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.680\nYou also have Open Recent.\n\n90\n00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.010\nSo if you hover over your Open Recent,\n\n91\n00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.070\nit'll pull up all of the different\nfiles that you have opened.\n\n92\n00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.480\nMy most recent was logoexample.psd.\n\n93\n00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.458\nYou can also do Close, Close All,\nClose and Go To Bridge, so\n\n94\n00:04:57.458 --> 00:05:00.900\nif you need to get out of something,\nyou can do that.\n\n95\n00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.640\nYou can also hit the little x on\neach of your little tab windows.\n\n96\n00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.410\nYour save options are also here.\n\n97\n00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.590\nI highly recommend that you\nlearn the shortcuts for saving.\n\n98\n00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.460\nSo saving in Photoshop on a Mac is Cmd+S,\n\n99\n00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.490\non a PC, it's Ctrl+S.\n\n100\n00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.560\nWhen you're in Photoshop, you're going\nto want to save, save, save, save,\n\n101\n00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.220\nbecause you might be doing\na huge document, it's beautiful,\n\n102\n00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.170\nand then all of a sudden, there's\na power outage and you lose everything.\n\n103\n00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.390\nThere's nothing more upsetting than losing\nwork, so make sure to save over and\n\n104\n00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.180\nover and over again.\n\n105\n00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.862\n>> Been there, done that.\n\n106\n00:05:36.862 --> 00:05:39.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it's so easy just to while you're\n\n107\n00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.660\nworking every few minutes Ctrl+S or\nCmd+S, or whichever one you're using.\n\n108\n00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.800\nAnd it's so easy to do but\npeople forget to do that.\n\n109\n00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.790\n>> Exactly, so\ndon't be one of those people.\n\n110\n00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:50.486\nLearn to save.\n\n111\n00:05:50.486 --> 00:05:55.262\nSo also by clicking this Save As button,\nthat gives you all of your different file\n\n112\n00:05:55.262 --> 00:06:00.050\ntype options which we'll be going\nover in one of our next episodes.\n\n113\n00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.220\nAlso under this menu we have Export.\n\n114\n00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.990\nSo Export,\nyou can do a quick export as a pmg.\n\n115\n00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.180\nSo pmg is a great file if you\nwant a transparent background.\n\n116\n00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.030\nIt's a smaller file.\n\n117\n00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.630\nThere are also other export options here\nand export preferences that you can set.\n\n118\n00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.460\nAnother important note is if you are doing\nanything for web design and you want to\n\n119\n00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:26.290\nsave files specifically for web, under CC\nit's now moved to your export file option.\n\n120\n00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.590\nIt used to be as its own little thing in\nyour list right under the Save section.\n\n121\n00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.030\nIt said Save for Web.\n\n122\n00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.000\nNow it's under Export,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n123\n00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.430\nAll right, also on here is something\ncalled Place Embedded and Place Linked.\n\n124\n00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.960\nThat is when you want to put another\npicture on top of your existing document,\n\n125\n00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.910\nfor example.\n\n126\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.090\nSo let's say that we wanted to take\na picture of your vacation and\n\n127\n00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.460\nput it on on our white blank space here.\n\n128\n00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.130\nIt's almost as if we are taking a physical\npicture and just placing it on the table.\n\n129\n00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.900\nThat's what Place Placing is.\n\n130\n00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.810\nSo you have two options,\nembedded and linked.\n\n131\n00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.050\nEmbedded is your traditional\nPhotoshop option.\n\n132\n00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.930\nSo, if you're on an old version of\nPhotoshop, it will just say Placed.\n\n133\n00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.640\nIt won't say Placed,\nEmbedded Place Linked.\n\n134\n00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.470\nPlace Linked is if you\nwant to place an item and\n\n135\n00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.020\nbe able to link it to all of its\nother instances on your computer.\n\n136\n00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.990\nOkay, so if you make an edit you\ncan make an edit on all instances.\n\n137\n00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.316\nSo if you have a logo and you change\nthe color of your logo and you want it to\n\n138\n00:07:24.316 --> 00:07:28.098\nchange everywhere, having your files\nlinked would allow you to do that, okay.\n\n139\n00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.937\nAlso down here in this bottom part of our\nFile menu, you see we have Import, Export,\n\n140\n00:07:35.937 --> 00:07:38.950\nand then we also have your Print options,\nas well.\n\n141\n00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.270\nSo those are all under your File menu.\n\n142\n00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.140\nLet's go to our next one.\n\n143\n00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.494\nSo our next one is our Edit menu.\n\n144\n00:07:46.494 --> 00:07:51.456\nEditing is where you'd go if you want\nto undo, step forward, step backward,\n\n145\n00:07:51.456 --> 00:07:55.608\ncut, copy, paste, anything like\nthat is under your Edit menu.\n\n146\n00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:59.153\nVirtually anything that you do\nin Photoshop has a shortcut For\n\n147\n00:07:59.153 --> 00:08:02.847\nit already and if it doesn't,\nyou can create a shortcut for it.\n\n148\n00:08:02.847 --> 00:08:06.470\nSo, if you wanna undo something,\ndon't go up to Edit and Undo.\n\n149\n00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.200\nThat just takes too many clicks.\n\n150\n00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.480\nJust do Control Z or Command Z,\nso Command if you're on a Mac,\n\n151\n00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.940\nControl if you're on a PC.\n\n152\n00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.730\nYou can also cut and paste in Photoshop.\n\n153\n00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.420\nIt's the same cut and paste shortcut\noptions as it is on your computer, so\n\n154\n00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.220\nCommand C, Control C, Command V,\nControl V, and then you have X for\n\n155\n00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.810\ncutting as well.\n\n156\n00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.640\nOkay, so cut, copy, paste.\n\n157\n00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.165\nPretty self\n>> M-hm.\n\n158\n00:08:29.165 --> 00:08:29.885\n>> explanatory.\n\n159\n00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.950\nAlso under the Edit menu is something that\npeople don't realize Photoshop has, and\n\n160\n00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.350\nthat is a way to check your spelling.\n\n161\n00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.190\n>> Hm.\n\n162\n00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.980\n>> Okay, so this is really, really\nimportant when you're creating a design\n\n163\n00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.960\nfor a client and\nyou love it and it's great.\n\n164\n00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.320\nYou've spent hours and hours and\nhours and hours working on it.\n\n165\n00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.555\nAnd then you hand it over to\nthe client and they see a typo.\n\n166\n00:08:48.555 --> 00:08:51.310\n>> [LAUGH] That's not gonna be good for\nbusiness is it?\n\n167\n00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.870\n>> No, so make sure to check spelling.\n\n168\n00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.870\nAnd also, just make a habit of\nyou checking it as well, and\n\n169\n00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.810\nthen having Photoshop check because you\ndon't wanna completely rely on a program\n\n170\n00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:06.410\nto check your spelling either, especially\nif you're spelling out people's names.\n\n171\n00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.335\nBecause Photoshop's not going to know.\n\n172\n00:09:08.335 --> 00:09:12.080\n[LAUGH] You can also find and\nreplace text.\n\n173\n00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.740\nSo let's say that you have a person's\nname, and they recently got married, and\n\n174\n00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.200\nyou need to change out their last name.\n\n175\n00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.130\nYou can find their existing last name,\nreplace text with their new last name.\n\n176\n00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.730\n>> Nice.\n>> Then there's something called Fill and\n\n177\n00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.440\nStroke under this Edit menu.\n\n178\n00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.580\nSo, filling is if you want to\nfill something with a color.\n\n179\n00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.690\nSo let's say that you have\nthis white blank document.\n\n180\n00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.330\nYou want to fill it with a solid color.\n\n181\n00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.670\nYou would go to Edit and Fill.\n\n182\n00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.590\nOkay?\nA stroke is if you want to add an outline\n\n183\n00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:42.650\nto something.\n\n184\n00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:47.240\nSo let's say we wanted to give a border\nto a shape we would go to our Stroke\n\n185\n00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.180\noption, okay?\n\n186\n00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.330\nAlso under our Edit menu we have\nall these Transform controls.\n\n187\n00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.160\nSo let me zoom into this so\nyou can see this a little bit better here.\n\n188\n00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.920\nOkay, so we have Puppet Warp, Perspective\nWarp, Free Transform, Transform.\n\n189\n00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.120\nAll of these are ways\nto manipulate an image.\n\n190\n00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.229\nThe first one listed here is Puppet Warp.\n\n191\n00:10:09.229 --> 00:10:11.520\nContent-Aware Scale's first but\n\n192\n00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.070\nthat's more when you're resizing things,\nthat's where it's gonna come into play.\n\n193\n00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:20.060\nThese other Transform controls are more\nwhen you have, let's say that you place\n\n194\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.710\na picture of a banana or a piece of\nan apple in here and you want to change\n\n195\n00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.030\nthe way that it looks, these are your\ntransform controls that you would use.\n\n196\n00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.990\nSo Puppet Warp.\n\n197\n00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.340\nPuppet Warp is this fascinating thing.\n\n198\n00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.270\nLet's say that you have a picture\nof a model and you like the way\n\n199\n00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.760\nthat she's standing but you don't\nlike where she's placed her hand.\n\n200\n00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:42.070\nPuppet Warp allows you to set anchor\nPoints and move where her hand is.\n\n201\n00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.900\nSo it's almost like you're taking\none of those marionette puppets and\n\n202\n00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.160\nkind of playing around with it.\n\n203\n00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.010\n>> That's amazing.\n\n204\n00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.510\n>> Yes, perspective warp is\nsomething that you would use if,\n\n205\n00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:54.300\nlet's say that you\nare designing something and\n\n206\n00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.260\nyou have an existing picture where\nit has some kind of dimension to it.\n\n207\n00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.820\nSo maybe it's a picture of Times Square,\nand you want to change out one of\n\n208\n00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.780\nthe buildings to be something\nthat you've created or\n\n209\n00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.640\na billboard that has your ad on it or\nsomething.\n\n210\n00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:13.230\nYou can do perspective warp to kind of\nchange the way your image is seen in\n\n211\n00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.760\nthat picture.\n\n212\n00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.710\nAlso Free Transform and Transform.\n\n213\n00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:22.110\nThis is what you do if you want to rotate,\nscale, flip anything like\n\n214\n00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.520\nthat where your changing the direction\nof your image is under your Transform.\n\n215\n00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.280\nYou can also set presets\nunder your edit menu as well.\n\n216\n00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.610\nSo you can set brush presets,\nyour Adobe PDF presets,\n\n217\n00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.969\ncolor settings, keyboard shortcuts,\nmenus, toolbars.\n\n218\n00:11:36.969 --> 00:11:40.960\nSo edit is where you go if you want to\nedit what's already in Photoshop as well\n\n219\n00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.890\nas edit your existing document.\n\n220\n00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:47.725\nSo it's a very long list here, you'll\nnotice that this drop down is extensive.\n\n221\n00:11:47.725 --> 00:11:51.230\n[LAUGH] So when in doubt check Edit.\n\n222\n00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.710\n>> Yeah [LAUGH]\n>> Then we have our Image menu.\n\n223\n00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.650\nSo up here we have Image Mode.\n\n224\n00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:04.070\nImage Mode are your color modes, so RGB,\nCMYK, Lab, all of these are here for you.\n\n225\n00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.590\nYou're probably primarily going\nto be designing in RGB or CMYK.\n\n226\n00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:12.830\nSo RGB is what you use for\ndigital screens or digital designs.\n\n227\n00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.890\nCMYK is what you use for print.\n\n228\n00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.000\nThen you have adjustments.\n\n229\n00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.960\nSo adjustments are if you want\nto do something to your image,\n\n230\n00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.100\nlike change the brightness, change\nthe hue, saturation, doing it from this\n\n231\n00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:31.050\nmenu right here, this is going to to\nbe destructively editing your photo.\n\n232\n00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.680\nSo on the exam,\n\n233\n00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.570\nif you're told to destructively\nedit your image by setting a hue or\n\n234\n00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:43.080\nsaturation of 70, you would get to it\nby going to Image Adjustments this way.\n\n235\n00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:43.810\nOkay.\nSo\n\n236\n00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.390\ndestructive means that you're\npermanently altering that image.\n\n237\n00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.490\nThere are other ways in Photoshop\nto do things non-destructively,\n\n238\n00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:51.690\nwhich you will learn about.\n\n239\n00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.581\nBut just keep in mind, as a little nugget.\n\n240\n00:12:53.581 --> 00:12:55.408\n>> [Laugh]\n>> That when you are on the test,\n\n241\n00:12:55.408 --> 00:12:57.530\nthis is where you would go.\n\n242\n00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:01.960\nYou also have Auto Tone, Auto Contrast,\nAuto Color, those are ways for\n\n243\n00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.980\nPhotoshop to automatically\ncorrect your image for you.\n\n244\n00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:09.440\nThen you have Image Size and Canvas Size.\n\n245\n00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.550\nImage Size is the size of your image,\nso let's say that this\n\n246\n00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:18.760\ndocument right here that we have open,\nit's image size would be an 8.5 by 11.\n\n247\n00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.180\nThe canvas size would also be 8.5 by\n11 because they're one and the same.\n\n248\n00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.305\nLet's say that we wanted to\nhave a canvas behind our image.\n\n249\n00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:27.530\nYou could add one.\n\n250\n00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:32.460\nSo let's say that we wanted a matte as if\nit were a photo to be placed in a frame.\n\n251\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.550\nYou could do that by adjusting the canvas.\n\n252\n00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:39.440\nSo the canvas is the largest\npart of your document.\n\n253\n00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.060\nOkay?\n\n254\n00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.620\nSo let's say that we wanted\na canvas to be an inch out\n\n255\n00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:47.490\nfrom our existing picture,\nour existing blank space.\n\n256\n00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.029\nYou can do that under canvas size.\n\n257\n00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.850\nYou can also rotate images\nunder Image as well.\n\n258\n00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:59.410\nIts very similar to your Edit Transform,\nso really either place you wanna go, but\n\n259\n00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.060\nImage Rotation also lets\nyou adjust your canvas.\n\n260\n00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:07.090\nYou can also duplicate,\napply any kind of image that you've done,\n\n261\n00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:10.590\ntrim your document,\ncrop it all under Image.\n\n262\n00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:11.720\nOkay?\n\n263\n00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.660\nNext is your Layer.\n\n264\n00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.750\nSo Layer has an entire panel unto itself.\n\n265\n00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.730\nWe're going to talk about\npanels in just a moment.\n\n266\n00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.960\nSo chances are you're never going\nto go up to this layer menu,\n\n267\n00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:26.060\nbecause there's a much easier way\nto look at layers in a panel.\n\n268\n00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:30.660\nBut if you forget how to access the panel\nand you panic on the test, don't forget to\n\n269\n00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.780\ncheck the words along the top of your\nscreen, cuz it will give you a hint.\n\n270\n00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.820\nSo if you need to do anything with layers,\nthis is where you could go if you\n\n271\n00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.949\nforget how to access your layers panel,\nwhich I'll show you in just a moment.\n\n272\n00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.440\nThen you have your Type menu.\n\n273\n00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.930\nSo Type has to do with anything with text.\n\n274\n00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:52.960\nSo if you need to change your font,if\nyou want to create a character style,\n\n275\n00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.250\na paragraph style,\nthat's all under Panels.\n\n276\n00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.020\nSo Panels,\n\n277\n00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.650\nwhat they are are fly out menus that you\ncan access on your Photoshop screen.\n\n278\n00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:05.860\nI'll be showing you one of those in\njust a moment when we get to Window.\n\n279\n00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:11.240\nSo anything that has to do with text,\nyou'll find it under your Type menu.\n\n280\n00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.570\nIt'll also be in your Panel and\n\n281\n00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:17.520\nalong the top of your screen when\nyou have your Type Tool selected.\n\n282\n00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.940\nSpeaking of selecting there's\nan option called Select.\n\n283\n00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:25.630\nSo Select is where'd you go if you\nwant to do Select All, Deselect,\n\n284\n00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.000\nReselect, Select Inverse.\n\n285\n00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.620\nSo selecting inverse is\nselecting the opposite.\n\n286\n00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.170\nSo let's say that you have\na white piece of paper, and\n\n287\n00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.280\nyou have a pencil in the middle.\n\n288\n00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.850\nYou want to select that white document.\n\n289\n00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:42.510\nWhat you could do is select your pencil.\n\n290\n00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.885\nSelect inverse and\nthen delete your background.\n\n291\n00:15:44.885 --> 00:15:46.470\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n292\n00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:48.941\n>> Okay.\nYou can also select a color range from\n\n293\n00:15:48.941 --> 00:15:50.237\nyour Select menu too.\n\n294\n00:15:50.237 --> 00:15:53.345\nSo if you're asked on your test,\nhey, select a color range.\n\n295\n00:15:53.345 --> 00:15:56.523\nThis is where it's hidden,\nunder your Select menu.\n\n296\n00:15:56.523 --> 00:16:01.842\nKey, if it starts with select, maybe you\nwanna check your menu, see if it's there.\n\n297\n00:16:01.842 --> 00:16:06.705\nYou can also find masking options here,\nwhich we'll be talking about,\n\n298\n00:16:06.705 --> 00:16:10.451\nas well as editing in Quick Mask,\nloading selections,\n\n299\n00:16:10.451 --> 00:16:14.218\nsaving selections,\nit's all under your Select menu.\n\n300\n00:16:14.218 --> 00:16:17.310\nOur next menu is something called Filter.\n\n301\n00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.139\nSo Filter's a really powerful menu.\n\n302\n00:16:20.139 --> 00:16:23.879\nSo it's where you would go if you wanted\nto make edits, let's say that you wanted\n\n303\n00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:28.590\nto make your picture look like it's been\npainted, you could go to your Filter menu.\n\n304\n00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:33.320\nYou could also do things like add a blur\nto your overall image by going to your\n\n305\n00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.930\nFilter menu as well.\n\n306\n00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:39.486\nThere's a whole filter gallery in here,\nwhere you can actually click through and\n\n307\n00:16:39.486 --> 00:16:42.270\nsee what the filters are going\nto do to your image.\n\n308\n00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.262\n>> Nice.\n\n309\n00:16:43.262 --> 00:16:44.454\n>> Then I have 3D.\n\n310\n00:16:44.454 --> 00:16:48.467\nSo 3D is where you'd wanna go if you\nare creating some kind of 3D design in\n\n311\n00:16:48.467 --> 00:16:49.810\nPhotoshop.\n\n312\n00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:54.260\nPhotoshop CC has very powerful 3D tools,\nso if 3D design is something that you're\n\n313\n00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.240\ninterested in,\nthis is where you'd find more information.\n\n314\n00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.950\nThen we have our View menu.\n\n315\n00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:06.440\nSo View has everything from zooming in,\nzooming out, to setting up proofs for\n\n316\n00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.710\nprinting.\n\n317\n00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:10.960\nIt's all the different ways that\nyou can view your document.\n\n318\n00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.100\nSo proof setup is where you would go if,\nlet's say that you wanted\n\n319\n00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.970\nto see exactly what it would like\nwhen you sent it to a printer.\n\n320\n00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:21.800\nYou would go to Proof Setup, pull up your\nproof colors, all of that's there for you.\n\n321\n00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.370\nZooming in and out,\nyou can do from this View menu.\n\n322\n00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:30.110\nBut there are so many different ways\nto zoom in and out on Photoshop.\n\n323\n00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:33.931\nI recommend you find a faster way,\nso maybe Cmd +,\n\n324\n00:17:33.931 --> 00:17:37.952\nCmd Ctrl +, Ctrl- is to zoom in and out.\n\n325\n00:17:37.952 --> 00:17:40.460\nYou can also change\nthe percentage on your window.\n\n326\n00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.220\nYou can do all sorts of different things.\n\n327\n00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.090\nThe magnifying tool, just lots and lots of\ndifferent options in Photoshop for you.\n\n328\n00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.480\nAlso under the View menu,\nyou have your rulers and guides.\n\n329\n00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.580\nSo rulers are what I\nhave enabled right now.\n\n330\n00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:56.330\nIf you look at the top of my screen,\nyou'll see these numbers here.\n\n331\n00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:00.240\nThis is a ruler, this is helpful\nif you're trying to figure out\n\n332\n00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.360\nexactly where you want\nto place something or\n\n333\n00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:08.400\nhow large something should be in relation\nto something else, a ruler is helpful.\n\n334\n00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.633\nYou also have your guides\nunder here as well.\n\n335\n00:18:10.633 --> 00:18:13.572\nSo if you wanted to create a guide,\nwhat that is,\n\n336\n00:18:13.572 --> 00:18:16.171\nis it lets you set\na point on your document.\n\n337\n00:18:16.171 --> 00:18:20.995\nLet's say that you wanted to find the\nmidpoint of your document, you can drag it\n\n338\n00:18:20.995 --> 00:18:26.190\nover from your ruler, set it, and then you\ncan align all of your objects to it, okay.\n\n339\n00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:32.090\nSo New Guide, Lock Guide, they're\nall at the bottom of your View menu.\n\n340\n00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.304\nThen you have this Window, so\n\n341\n00:18:34.304 --> 00:18:38.590\nWindow is where you would go\nif you need to find a panel.\n\n342\n00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.020\nSo I mentioned panels before,\nthey're little fly out menus.\n\n343\n00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:45.210\nIf you don't have them up already,\ngo to Window to enable them.\n\n344\n00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:50.030\nSo this shows you all of your different\npanel options, there are a ton of them.\n\n345\n00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:53.000\nSo if you're looking for\nCharacter, Paragraph, Brush,\n\n346\n00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.910\nthey're all here under Window.\n\n347\n00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:58.770\nAt the top of Window,\nyou'll see that you have Window Arrange.\n\n348\n00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:02.650\nWindow Arrange allows you to set\nhow you want to view your files.\n\n349\n00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.520\nSo let's say that you\nhave four pictures open,\n\n350\n00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.710\nthey all show up as little tabs\nacross the top of your screen.\n\n351\n00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.090\nIf you don't want them\nto show up like that,\n\n352\n00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:14.960\nyou can say to tile horizontally, four up,\n\n353\n00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.190\nsix up, consolidate all to tabs, all\nsorts of different things for you there.\n\n354\n00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.970\nThis is a designer's preference, so\n\n355\n00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:25.400\nif you don't like the way that Photoshop's\ndefaulted, you can change that there.\n\n356\n00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.160\nAlso under Window is an option for\nWork Space.\n\n357\n00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.760\nSo Work Space are all the default\npreferences that are already in Photoshop.\n\n358\n00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.190\nYou were probably on Essentials Default,\nwhich is fine.\n\n359\n00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:37.720\nIf you're not, you can change to it or\n\n360\n00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.060\nstay in whatever kind of work\nspace you're in currently.\n\n361\n00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:44.060\nSo let's say that you were\ndesigning motion graphics.\n\n362\n00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:49.130\nSo doing some kind of video editing, you\nmight want your work space to say Motion.\n\n363\n00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:53.920\nOr if you're doing work space and you are\na painter, you're an artist, you're doing\n\n364\n00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:58.830\na lot of painting in Photoshop,\nyou can go to Painting here, as well.\n\n365\n00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:03.670\nOkay, so what that does is it sets what\nkind of panels it thinks you need.\n\n366\n00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.260\nYou can also set your own work space too.\n\n367\n00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.440\nSo if you like your work\nspace to look a certain way,\n\n368\n00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.480\nkind of like how people organize\ntheir desks, it's a very similar way.\n\n369\n00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.010\nYou can pick what tools you want where,\nwhat panels you want where,\n\n370\n00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.500\nwhat colors you want.\n\n371\n00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.720\nIt's all available for you.\n\n372\n00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.480\nPhotoshop's an extremely\ncustomizable work space.\n\n373\n00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.460\nThen you have your Help menu.\n\n374\n00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.450\nSo this is where you'd go if you\nwanted to search for an answer.\n\n375\n00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.305\nAnd you didn't want to look it up online,\n\n376\n00:20:29.305 --> 00:20:32.590\n[LAUGH] you can look it up\nhere under Help and Search.\n\n377\n00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.460\nSo that is your main menu in Photoshop.\n\n378\n00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.260\nSo any questions so\nfar with the main menu before we move on?\n\n379\n00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.700\n>> No, a lot of options there.\n\n380\n00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.220\nBut I can see we're familiarizing myself\nwith where things are will make it much\n\n381\n00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.600\neasier to work with\nthe product in the future.\n\n382\n00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.870\n>> It definitely does, definitely does.\n\n383\n00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:53.370\nSo let me direct your attention to\nthe far left of the screen now.\n\n384\n00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.260\nFar left over here,\nthis is your tool panel.\n\n385\n00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.270\nThis is where all your tools are located.\n\n386\n00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:59.980\nSo if you're trying to\ndo something specific,\n\n387\n00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.270\nlike use a paintbrush,\nthis is where you'd go to find it.\n\n388\n00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.510\nNow your tool menu might\nlook different than mine.\n\n389\n00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.310\nI have mine double stacked.\n\n390\n00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:11.250\nIf you like it like this, you can just\nhit these double arrows on the left.\n\n391\n00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:16.670\nI'm going to collapse mine just so\nit's easier for you all to see.\n\n392\n00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:21.030\nBut if you ever see those two arrows, it\njust means that you can expand something\n\n393\n00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:24.240\nor contract it,\ndepending on what you need to do.\n\n394\n00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.574\nAll right, so I'm going to quickly go over\nwhere these tools are and briefly explain\n\n395\n00:21:28.574 --> 00:21:32.173\nthem, but we are going to be going\nover each of these tools in depth, so\n\n396\n00:21:32.173 --> 00:21:33.296\ndon't worry there.\n\n397\n00:21:33.296 --> 00:21:37.670\n[COUGH] All right,\nlet's go over this first tool.\n\n398\n00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:39.910\nSo this first tool is your Move Tool.\n\n399\n00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:41.670\nIt might look slightly\ndifferent on your end.\n\n400\n00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.100\nIt will have an arrow\nattached to it in some way.\n\n401\n00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.815\nPhotoshop keeps changing what the move\ntool looks like for some reason.\n\n402\n00:21:46.815 --> 00:21:48.999\nIt's changed twice in the last six months.\n\n403\n00:21:48.999 --> 00:21:50.157\nI don't know why.\n\n404\n00:21:50.157 --> 00:21:50.937\n>> Really?\n\n405\n00:21:50.937 --> 00:21:52.085\n>> Yes, but it has changed.\n\n406\n00:21:52.085 --> 00:21:55.230\n[LAUGH] Move Tool allows you to\nmove something on your document.\n\n407\n00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:59.360\nThen you have your Artboard Tool,\nwhich is a new thing in Photoshop CC.\n\n408\n00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.660\nArtboards are something that's\nused in programs like Illustrator,\n\n409\n00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:07.550\nwhere you want to have multiple\ndocuments available in one file.\n\n410\n00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:09.350\nPhotoshop didn't used to\nallow you to do that.\n\n411\n00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.070\nNow it does.\n\n412\n00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:13.440\nThat is your Artboard Tool, okay?\n\n413\n00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.910\nGoing to the immediate right,\nthese are your Marquee Tools.\n\n414\n00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:19.420\nMarquee Tools are selection tools.\n\n415\n00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:23.150\nSo if you wanted to select a very\nparticular part of an image,\n\n416\n00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:24.010\nyou could do that here.\n\n417\n00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:26.510\nSo if you wanted to select\na button off of a shirt,\n\n418\n00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.920\nyou could use the Elliptical Marquee Tool.\n\n419\n00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.530\nYou could copy it, you could edit it,\nyou could do whatever you want.\n\n420\n00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.850\nIt's just a way to select.\n\n421\n00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:38.170\nAnother way to select is\nwith the Lasso Tools.\n\n422\n00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:42.290\nSo you have your regular lasso,\npolygonal, and then magnetic lasso.\n\n423\n00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:45.270\nThese are ways for you to be more\nspecific with your selections.\n\n424\n00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:46.680\nSo you can actually click, hold,\n\n425\n00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.400\ndrag around, get something more\nspecific than just a geometric shape.\n\n426\n00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:56.196\nTo the right of that, we have another way\nto select as your Quick Selection Tool and\n\n427\n00:22:56.196 --> 00:22:56.829\nMagic Wand.\n\n428\n00:22:56.829 --> 00:23:01.729\nThe Quick Selection Tool allows you\nto drag a brush over an image and\n\n429\n00:23:01.729 --> 00:23:05.258\nselect specific parts that you want.\n\n430\n00:23:05.258 --> 00:23:09.108\nThe Magic Wand Tool works in a similar\nway, it picks up similar colors, so\n\n431\n00:23:09.108 --> 00:23:12.461\nthat way, you can kind of quickly\nremove a white background, or\n\n432\n00:23:12.461 --> 00:23:15.404\nyou can select similar parts\nof an image based on color.\n\n433\n00:23:15.404 --> 00:23:18.740\nTo the left, we have our Crop Tool.\n\n434\n00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.140\nSo the Crop Tool is a way to\ndestructively change your image.\n\n435\n00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.730\nSo it's like taking a pair of scissors and\ncutting off the bottom of a picture.\n\n436\n00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:28.980\nThat's what a Crop Tool does.\n\n437\n00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.370\nSo you have Crop,\nPerspective Crop and then slicing.\n\n438\n00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:37.170\nSlicing is something that you do if\nyou want to create images for the web.\n\n439\n00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:40.579\nSo if you wanted to design\nsome buttons in Photoshop,\n\n440\n00:23:40.579 --> 00:23:42.941\nyou can slice them out for use on web.\n\n441\n00:23:42.941 --> 00:23:46.134\nOkay, to the right of that tool, we have\nthe Eyedropper Tool, the Ruler Tool,\n\n442\n00:23:46.134 --> 00:23:48.400\nthe Note Tool, the Count Tool.\n\n443\n00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.418\nThese are ways for\nyou to organize your document.\n\n444\n00:23:51.418 --> 00:23:52.621\nOkay, so using notes, so\n\n445\n00:23:52.621 --> 00:23:56.465\nnotes would be something that you'd use if\nyou wanted to leave a note for yourself.\n\n446\n00:23:56.465 --> 00:24:00.428\nIf you're leaving for the day at work and\nYou wanna remember where you left off,\n\n447\n00:24:00.428 --> 00:24:02.690\nyou can leave yourself\na little sticky note.\n\n448\n00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:03.689\n>> Handy.\n[LAUGH]\n\n449\n00:24:03.689 --> 00:24:04.455\n>> Yes.\n\n450\n00:24:04.455 --> 00:24:08.240\nBut what you're probably going to be using\nthe most from here is the eyedropper tool.\n\n451\n00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.840\nThe eyedropper tool allows\nyou to select colors, okay?\n\n452\n00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.580\nThen, to the far left,\nwe have our healing brush tools.\n\n453\n00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.820\nThis is where you would go if you wanted\nto remove a blemish off of a face,\n\n454\n00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.410\nif you wanted to move\nsomething out of a picture.\n\n455\n00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:24.490\nYou can do that here.\n\n456\n00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.540\nThen we have our brush tool.\n\n457\n00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.900\nSo, the brush tool has your brush tools,\nyour pencil tools,\n\n458\n00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.970\nyour color replacement tools,\nyour mixer brushes.\n\n459\n00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.960\nThey are all here for you.\n\n460\n00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.930\nThis is what you think of when you\nremember playing with Paint as a kid,\n\n461\n00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:41.480\non Windows maybe.\n\n462\n00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.380\nThis is very similar to that,\nbut it has a lot more options.\n\n463\n00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.190\nYou can create really beautiful artistic\ndesigns with your brush tool in Photoshop.\n\n464\n00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.370\nThen you have your clone stamp tool or\npattern stamp tool.\n\n465\n00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:56.870\nThat allows you to copy certain parts of\nan image and paste it over another part.\n\n466\n00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.210\nThen you have your history brush tool,\nart history brush tool.\n\n467\n00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:04.420\nThese are something that you\nprobably wouldn't use all that much,\n\n468\n00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.340\nbut if for some reason you're ever\nasked to do it, here they are.\n\n469\n00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.930\nWe're going to be demonstrating\nwhat they do later on.\n\n470\n00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.390\nThen you have your eraser tool.\n\n471\n00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:17.270\nSo, the eraser tool allows you to\ndestructively remove parts of an image.\n\n472\n00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:21.650\nSo, if you wanted to remove\na line that you'd drawn,\n\n473\n00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:23.260\nyou could use your eraser tool for it.\n\n474\n00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:28.660\nThen you have your paint bucket tool and\ngradient tools.\n\n475\n00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:34.620\nThe gradient tool allows you to create\na fading effect on an image, okay?\n\n476\n00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.241\nThe paint bucket tool allows\nyou to fill an area with color.\n\n477\n00:25:39.764 --> 00:25:42.740\nOkay?\nThen, here you have your blur, sharpen and\n\n478\n00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:43.290\nsmudge tools.\n\n479\n00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:47.330\nThese are a way to edit photos if you\nwanted to blur something out, smudge it,\n\n480\n00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.240\nif you wanted to sharpen something so\n\n481\n00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.690\nyou could read it better,\nthis is where you would go.\n\n482\n00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.640\nSimilar to those tools is you have\nthe dodge, burn and sponge tools.\n\n483\n00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.460\nThese either brighten parts of an image,\ndarken parts of an image, or\n\n484\n00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.620\nadd saturation to an image.\n\n485\n00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.850\nLike I said, we are going to\nbe practicing all of these.\n\n486\n00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.860\nThis is probably going way over your head.\n\n487\n00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.950\nJust try to remember where they are,\nthat's the key point here.\n\n488\n00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.130\nThen you have your pen tool.\n\n489\n00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:17.040\nThe pen tool allows you to create\nvery specific selections, or\n\n490\n00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.320\nto draw something out.\n\n491\n00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:23.540\nThe pen tool is pretty much\nthe fundamental basis of Illustrator.\n\n492\n00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.820\nSo, if you're familiar with Illustrator,\nthis is very similar.\n\n493\n00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.020\nThen you have your T or your type tool.\n\n494\n00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.610\nThis is where you would go\nif you wanted to add text.\n\n495\n00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.370\nSo you can add horizontal text,\n\n496\n00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:37.850\nyou can add vertical text,\nyou can do masking text.\n\n497\n00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:39.407\nIt's all there for you.\n\n498\n00:26:40.936 --> 00:26:42.520\nThen you have your arrow tools.\n\n499\n00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.090\nThese are ways for you to select paths.\n\n500\n00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:47.449\nSo if you've created\na path with the pen tool,\n\n501\n00:26:47.449 --> 00:26:50.789\nthis is where you would go to move\nthose paths or edit those paths.\n\n502\n00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.590\nThen you have your shape tool.\n\n503\n00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:57.806\nThe shape tool allows you to create shapes\nlike circles, and squares, and lines, and\n\n504\n00:26:57.806 --> 00:26:58.629\ncustom shapes.\n\n505\n00:27:00.663 --> 00:27:04.720\nThe hand tool down here,\nit allows you to pan across your document.\n\n506\n00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.690\nSo if you have a huge image, let's say\nit's a picture of the Grand Canyon,\n\n507\n00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:12.490\nit's massive, that you took on your\ndigital camera, you want to zoom in and\n\n508\n00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.940\nmove so you can see this\nparticular animal on the ridge.\n\n509\n00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.521\nYou could do that with your hand tool.\n\n510\n00:27:19.056 --> 00:27:23.368\nThen you have your little magnifying\nglass which allows you to zoom, okay?\n\n511\n00:27:23.368 --> 00:27:26.550\nSo, there is a tool for it,\nyou can also use a shortcut for it.\n\n512\n00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:28.350\nIt's all there for you.\n\n513\n00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:31.220\nAt the bottom of your panel,\nthese are your colors here,\n\n514\n00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.640\nit's your foreground and\nbackground colors.\n\n515\n00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:38.020\nSo if you're trying to figure out where\nto change the color, there you go.\n\n516\n00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:43.190\nNow there's one more thing I wanted to\nshow you before we end today's lesson, and\n\n517\n00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:44.630\nthat's where your panels are.\n\n518\n00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.320\nSo I've mentioned what panels are,\nlet's look at them.\n\n519\n00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:51.170\nSo over on the far right is\nwhere you have your panels.\n\n520\n00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:53.380\nSo if you were to click on Layers,\n\n521\n00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.950\nyou'd see that you have a little fly\nout menu that gives you more options.\n\n522\n00:27:56.950 --> 00:28:01.420\nSo if you needed to create a new layer,\nadjust a layer, this is where you'd go.\n\n523\n00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:07.480\nIf we click on color, you'll see how\nyou can select color, change color.\n\n524\n00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.850\nIf you click on swatches,\n\n525\n00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:13.220\nthis is where you'd go to find colors\nthat are already in Photoshop.\n\n526\n00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.130\nYou can also create your own color swatch.\n\n527\n00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.540\nSo let's say that you\nare creating work for\n\n528\n00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:20.770\nan existing brand and\nthey have a particular color swatch.\n\n529\n00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:24.150\nYou can add that swatch to your\nPhotoshop swatches panel so\n\n530\n00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:27.915\nthat way you have access to that exact\nsame color whenever you're doing design.\n\n531\n00:28:27.915 --> 00:28:33.190\nSo, again, if you're ever missing\na panel or you want to add a panel,\n\n532\n00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:37.930\nwhat you do is you go to window and panels\nand you can select whatever one you want.\n\n533\n00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:44.310\nSo let's try, I'll just add,\nlet's do styles.\n\n534\n00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.713\nSo styles, you can either drag it out.\n\n535\n00:28:48.875 --> 00:28:51.530\nYou can expand it, collapse it.\n\n536\n00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:52.800\nYou can pull it back in.\n\n537\n00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:57.970\nPhotoshop is extremely flexible in how\nyou want it to arrange your workspace.\n\n538\n00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:01.930\nAnd that is an introduction\nto our Photoshop workspace.\n\n539\n00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:03.080\n>> Fantastic, Cara.\n\n540\n00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.490\nGreat tour of the interface.\n\n541\n00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:07.520\nLike we said at the very beginning,\na relatively complex application,\n\n542\n00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.770\nimportant that we can find our way around,\nfind the tools we need,\n\n543\n00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:14.530\nknow what menus options are under so\nthat we can work effectively.\n\n544\n00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:17.750\nAnd as Cara pointed out several times,\nwanna be able to pass that exam as well.\n\n545\n00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:19.490\nSo we thank you for that tour, Cara.\n\n546\n00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:22.230\nCan't wait to dive in and\nlearn more about Photoshop.\n\n547\n00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.260\nBut that's gonna have to\nwait til our next episode.\n\n548\n00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.790\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n549\n00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:27.420\n>> And I'm Cara Page.\n\n550\n00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:29.638\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n551\n00:29:29.638 --> 00:29:37.370\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
