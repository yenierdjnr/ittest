00:00:17.420\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.947\nAnd today we're doing\nAdobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:19.947 --> 00:00:23.917\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna be taking a look at the user\n\n6\n00:00:23.917 --> 00:00:24.640\ninterface.\n\n7\n00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.013\nAn important part of learning any\napplication, especially one that can be as\n\n8\n00:00:29.013 --> 00:00:32.390\ncomplex as this is to learn\nyour way around that interface.\n\n9\n00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.420\nAnd here to help us with that is Ms.\nKara Page.\n\n10\n00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.330\nHow you doing, Kara?\n\n11\n00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.070\nI'm great, are you ready to get started?\n\n12\n00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.602\n>> I am.\n\n13\n00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:43.050\n>> All right, so go ahead and\nopen up Photoshop on your end, okay?\n\n14\n00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.590\nSo let's make sure that it's up and\nrunning.\n\n15\n00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.680\nIt should look very similar to my screen.\n\n16\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.490\nSo when you open up CC 2015, it defaults\nto this screen where it shows you\n\n17\n00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.020\nrecent files, libraries,\npresets, and that's\n\n18\n00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.320\nreally helpful once you've been using\nPhotoshop cuz that's where your files are.\n\n19\n00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.350\nSo if you wanna pull up a recent\nfile it's there for you.\n\n20\n00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.192\nIf you've never used Photoshop before,\nthat doesn't help you very much.\n\n21\n00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:08.430\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.147\n>> So what we're going to do, just so\n\n23\n00:01:10.147 --> 00:01:14.020\nyou can see the entire workspace, is we\nare going to click on this New button.\n\n24\n00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.690\nSo it says New...\n\n25\n00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.540\nI'm going to click on it and\nit pulls up this Preferences window.\n\n26\n00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.580\nI'm just going to select\ndocument type US Paper.\n\n27\n00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.550\nThat's probably what yours\nis defaulted to as well.\n\n28\n00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.611\nIf it's not, just click on this dropdown\nhere and select US Paper, okay.\n\n29\n00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:34.480\nAnd then go ahead and click OK.\n\n30\n00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.355\nAnd now we have our workspace\nup in it's full glory.\n\n31\n00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:38.294\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n32\n00:01:38.294 --> 00:01:41.246\nwhat we're going to do is we're\ngonna take a tour of Photoshop.\n\n33\n00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:44.970\nSo we're not gonna be learning\nthe tools or the real intricacies.\n\n34\n00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.680\nWe're learning a road map\non how to use Photoshop.\n\n35\n00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.120\nSo, let's go ahead and get started and\n\n36\n00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.900\ntalk about what these top words\nare here at the top of your screen.\n\n37\n00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.140\nThese are your file options,\nyour main toolbar here, okay.\n\n38\n00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.750\nSo it's your main menu.\n\n39\n00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.570\nIf you're on a Mac versus a PC it's\ngoing to look slightly different.\n\n40\n00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.618\nDon't worry, they both have the same\ncapabilities, just certain tools or\n\n41\n00:02:09.618 --> 00:02:12.413\ncertain options are hidden\nunder a different menu.\n\n42\n00:02:12.413 --> 00:02:15.362\n>> Of course,\nmake it a little more complex for us.\n\n43\n00:02:15.362 --> 00:02:18.313\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes, yes, so if you're on a Mac you'll\n\n44\n00:02:18.313 --> 00:02:23.810\nhave this Photoshop CC here, with options\nlike Preferences, Services and things.\n\n45\n00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.530\nThis Preferences option,\nif you are on a PC,\n\n46\n00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.230\nis actually hidden under your Edit menu.\n\n47\n00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.970\nThat's one of the main differences here.\n\n48\n00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.520\nSo under this Photoshop CC menu,\n\n49\n00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.540\nyou can learn about your version of CC,\nwhat updated version you're on.\n\n50\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.905\nYou can learn about your\nplugins if you're interested.\n\n51\n00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:46.310\n[LAUGH] You can pull up your preferences,\nwhich is really, really helpful.\n\n52\n00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.190\nSo your preferences sets everything from\nwhat color you want your screen to be,\n\n53\n00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.790\nto your units and rulers,\n\n54\n00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.990\nwhether you want them to be in\nsomething called pixels or inches.\n\n55\n00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.920\nYou can set your export options.\n\n56\n00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.720\nIt's all available for you here under this\nPhotoshop CC menu, or Edit Preferences,\n\n57\n00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.750\ndepending on where you are.\n\n58\n00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.810\nYou can also quit Photoshop\nfrom here as well.\n\n59\n00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.160\nSo if you're trying to close it out and\n\n60\n00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.610\nyou don't have that X like you do on\na Windows, you can quit it from this menu.\n\n61\n00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.150\nLet's go into File, and I'm gonna go\nahead and zoom into this a little bit, so\n\n62\n00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.510\nyou can really see this.\n\n63\n00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.260\nSo this File menu is pretty helpful for\n\n64\n00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.590\nyou cuz this is where you're going to go\nwhen you want to create a new document,\n\n65\n00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.025\nopen an existing document, or place\na document into your current document.\n\n66\n00:03:31.025 --> 00:03:33.920\nSo this File > New button right here,\n\n67\n00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.655\nthat is what we would do if\nwe want a blank work space.\n\n68\n00:03:36.655 --> 00:03:38.360\nIt's what we did just a minute ago.\n\n69\n00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.374\nSo we have this nice white sheet of paper,\n\n70\n00:03:40.374 --> 00:03:43.783\nit's like you took it out of your\nnotebook and put it on your computer.\n\n71\n00:03:43.783 --> 00:03:45.607\nThat's what you do if\nyou go to File > New.\n\n72\n00:03:45.607 --> 00:03:49.930\nFile > Open is if you\nhave an existing file.\n\n73\n00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.870\nSo let's say that you have a photo\nof you on vacation with your family,\n\n74\n00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.850\nyou wanna open it up, do some photo edits\nto it, you would go to your Open option.\n\n75\n00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.870\nBrowse and Bridge, Browse and\nBridge is this cool little way for\n\n76\n00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.900\nyou to look at your files.\n\n77\n00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.430\nSo Adobe has this program called Bridge,\n\n78\n00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.680\nessentially it's an advanced finder for\nyou.\n\n79\n00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.172\nSo if you are a photographer and\nyou're taking 200 pictures at a wedding,\n\n80\n00:04:15.172 --> 00:04:19.249\nyou're probably going to want to\nbrowse and bridge as an easier way for\n\n81\n00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:22.151\nyou to find the specific\nfiles you're looking for\n\n82\n00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:25.357\ninstead of seeing a file\nname like DC1258376.\n\n83\n00:04:25.357 --> 00:04:26.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's not really helpful to you.\n\n84\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.420\nSo Browse and\nBridge might be a good option for you.\n\n85\n00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.460\nYou can also open as a Smart Object.\n\n86\n00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.370\nSo a Smart Object would be maybe something\nthat you've created in another program\n\n87\n00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.420\nlike Illustrator.\n\n88\n00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.210\nIf you want to open up a logo,\nyou can open it as a Smart Object.\n\n89\n00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.680\nYou also have Open Recent.\n\n90\n00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.010\nSo if you hover over your Open Recent,\n\n91\n00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.070\nit'll pull up all of the different\nfiles that you have opened.\n\n92\n00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.480\nMy most recent was logoexample.psd.\n\n93\n00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.458\nYou can also do Close, Close All,\nClose and Go To Bridge, so\n\n94\n00:04:57.458 --> 00:05:00.900\nif you need to get out of something,\nyou can do that.\n\n95\n00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.640\nYou can also hit the little x on\neach of your little tab windows.\n\n96\n00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.410\nYour save options are also here.\n\n97\n00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.590\nI highly recommend that you\nlearn the shortcuts for saving.\n\n98\n00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.460\nSo saving in Photoshop on a Mac is Cmd+S,\n\n99\n00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.490\non a PC, it's Ctrl+S.\n\n100\n00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.560\nWhen you're in Photoshop, you're going\nto want to save, save, save, save,\n\n101\n00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.220\nbecause you might be doing\na huge document, it's beautiful,\n\n102\n00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.170\nand then all of a sudden, there's\na power outage and you lose everything.\n\n103\n00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.390\nThere's nothing more upsetting than losing\nwork, so make sure to save over and\n\n104\n00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.180\nover and over again.\n\n105\n00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.862\n>> Been there, done that.\n\n106\n00:05:36.862 --> 00:05:39.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it's so easy just to while you're\n\n107\n00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.660\nworking every few minutes Ctrl+S or\nCmd+S, or whichever one you're using.\n\n108\n00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.800\nAnd it's so easy to do but\npeople forget to do that.\n\n109\n00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.790\n>> Exactly, so\ndon't be one of those people.\n\n110\n00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:50.486\nLearn to save.\n\n111\n00:05:50.486 --> 00:05:55.262\nSo also by clicking this Save As button,\nthat gives you all of your different file\n\n112\n00:05:55.262 --> 00:06:00.050\ntype options which we'll be going\nover in one of our next episodes.\n\n113\n00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.220\nAlso under this menu we have Export.\n\n114\n00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.990\nSo Export,\nyou can do a quick export as a pmg.\n\n115\n00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.180\nSo pmg is a great file if you\nwant a transparent background.\n\n116\n00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.030\nIt's a smaller file.\n\n117\n00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.630\nThere are also other export options here\nand export preferences that you can set.\n\n118\n00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.460\nAnother important note is if you are doing\nanything for web design and you want to\n\n119\n00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:26.290\nsave files specifically for web, under CC\nit's now moved to your export file option.\n\n120\n00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.590\nIt used to be as its own little thing in\nyour list right under the Save section.\n\n121\n00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.030\nIt said Save for Web.\n\n122\n00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.000\nNow it's under Export,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n123\n00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.430\nAll right, also on here is something\ncalled Place Embedded and Place Linked.\n\n124\n00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.960\nThat is when you want to put another\npicture on top of your existing document,\n\n125\n00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.910\nfor example.\n\n126\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.090\nSo let's say that we wanted to take\na picture of your vacation and\n\n127\n00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.460\nput it on on our white blank space here.\n\n128\n00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.130\nIt's almost as if we are taking a physical\npicture and just placing it on the table.\n\n129\n00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.900\nThat's what Place Placing is.\n\n130\n00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.810\nSo you have two options,\nembedded and linked.\n\n131\n00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.050\nEmbedded is your traditional\nPhotoshop option.\n\n132\n00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.930\nSo, if you're on an old version of\nPhotoshop, it will just say Placed.\n\n133\n00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.640\nIt won't say Placed,\nEmbedded Place Linked.\n\n134\n00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.470\nPlace Linked is if you\nwant to place an item and\n\n135\n00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.020\nbe able to link it to all of its\nother instances on your computer.\n\n136\n00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.990\nOkay, so if you make an edit you\ncan make an edit on all instances.\n\n137\n00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.316\nSo if you have a logo and you change\nthe color of your logo and you want it to\n\n138\n00:07:24.316 --> 00:07:28.098\nchange everywhere, having your files\nlinked would allow you to do that, okay.\n\n139\n00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.937\nAlso down here in this bottom part of our\nFile menu, you see we have Import, Export,\n\n140\n00:07:35.937 --> 00:07:38.950\nand then we also have your Print options,\nas well.\n\n141\n00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.270\nSo those are all under your File menu.\n\n142\n00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.140\nLet's go to our next one.\n\n143\n00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.494\nSo our next one is our Edit menu.\n\n144\n00:07:46.494 --> 00:07:51.456\nEditing is where you'd go if you want\nto undo, step forward, step backward,\n\n145\n00:07:51.456 --> 00:07:55.608\ncut, copy, paste, anything like\nthat is under your Edit menu.\n\n146\n00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:59.153\nVirtually anything that you do\nin Photoshop has a shortcut For\n\n147\n00:07:59.153 --> 00:08:02.847\nit already and if it doesn't,\nyou can create a shortcut for it.\n\n148\n00:08:02.847 --> 00:08:06.470\nSo, if you wanna undo something,\ndon't go up to Edit and Undo.\n\n149\n00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.200\nThat just takes too many clicks.\n\n150\n00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.480\nJust do Control Z or Command Z,\nso Command if you're on a Mac,\n\n151\n00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.940\nControl if you're on a PC.\n\n152\n00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.730\nYou can also cut and paste in Photoshop.\n\n153\n00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.420\nIt's the same cut and paste shortcut\noptions as it is on your computer, so\n\n154\n00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.220\nCommand C, Control C, Command V,\nControl V, and then you have X for\n\n155\n00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.810\ncutting as well.\n\n156\n00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.640\nOkay, so cut, copy, paste.\n\n157\n00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.165\nPretty self\n>> M-hm.\n\n158\n00:08:29.165 --> 00:08:29.885\n>> explanatory.\n\n159\n00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.950\nAlso under the Edit menu is something that\npeople don't realize Photoshop has, and\n\n160\n00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.350\nthat is a way to check your spelling.\n\n161\n00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.190\n>> Hm.\n\n162\n00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.980\n>> Okay, so this is really, really\nimportant when you're creating a design\n\n163\n00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.960\nfor a client and\nyou love it and it's great.\n\n164\n00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.320\nYou've spent hours and hours and\nhours and hours working on it.\n\n165\n00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.555\nAnd then you hand it over to\nthe client and they see a typo.\n\n166\n00:08:48.555 --> 00:08:51.310\n>> [LAUGH] That's not gonna be good for\nbusiness is it?\n\n167\n00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.870\n>> No, so make sure to check spelling.\n\n168\n00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.870\nAnd also, just make a habit of\nyou checking it as well, and\n\n169\n00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.810\nthen having Photoshop check because you\ndon't wanna completely rely on a program\n\n170\n00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:06.410\nto check your spelling either, especially\nif you're spelling out people's names.\n\n171\n00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.335\nBecause Photoshop's not going to know.\n\n172\n00:09:08.335 --> 00:09:12.080\n[LAUGH] You can also find and\nreplace text.\n\n173\n00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.740\nSo let's say that you have a person's\nname, and they recently got married, and\n\n174\n00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.200\nyou need to change out their last name.\n\n175\n00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.130\nYou can find their existing last name,\nreplace text with their new last name.\n\n176\n00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.730\n>> Nice.\n>> Then there's something called Fill and\n\n177\n00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.440\nStroke under this Edit menu.\n\n178\n00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.580\nSo, filling is if you want to\nfill something with a color.\n\n179\n00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.690\nSo let's say that you have\nthis white blank document.\n\n180\n00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.330\nYou want to fill it with a solid color.\n\n181\n00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.670\nYou would go to Edit and Fill.\n\n182\n00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.590\nOkay?\nA stroke is if you want to add an outline\n\n183\n00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:42.650\nto something.\n\n184\n00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:47.240\nSo let's say we wanted to give a border\nto a shape we would go to our Stroke\n\n185\n00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.180\noption, okay?\n\n186\n00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.330\nAlso under our Edit menu we have\nall these Transform controls.\n\n187\n00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.160\nSo let me zoom into this so\nyou can see this a little bit better here.\n\n188\n00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.920\nOkay, so we have Puppet Warp, Perspective\nWarp, Free Transform, Transform.\n\n189\n00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.120\nAll of these are ways\nto manipulate an image.\n\n190\n00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.229\nThe first one listed here is Puppet Warp.\n\n191\n00:10:09.229 --> 00:10:11.520\nContent-Aware Scale's first but\n\n192\n00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.070\nthat's more when you're resizing things,\nthat's where it's gonna come into play.\n\n193\n00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:20.060\nThese other Transform controls are more\nwhen you have, let's say that you place\n\n194\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.710\na picture of a banana or a piece of\nan apple in here and you want to change\n\n195\n00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.030\nthe way that it looks, these are your\ntransform controls that you would use.\n\n196\n00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.990\nSo Puppet Warp.\n\n197\n00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.340\nPuppet Warp is this fascinating thing.\n\n198\n00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.270\nLet's say that you have a picture\nof a model and you like the way\n\n199\n00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.760\nthat she's standing but you don't\nlike where she's placed her hand.\n\n200\n00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:42.070\nPuppet Warp allows you to set anchor\nPoints and move where her hand is.\n\n201\n00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.900\nSo it's almost like you're taking\none of those marionette puppets and\n\n202\n00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.160\nkind of playing around with it.\n\n203\n00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.010\n>> That's amazing.\n\n204\n00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.510\n>> Yes, perspective warp is\nsomething that you would use if,\n\n205\n00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:54.300\nlet's say that you\nare designing something and\n\n206\n00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.260\nyou have an existing picture where\nit has some kind of dimension to it.\n\n207\n00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.820\nSo maybe it's a picture of Times Square,\nand you want to change out one of\n\n208\n00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.780\nthe buildings to be something\nthat you've created or\n\n209\n00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.640\na billboard that has your ad on it or\nsomething.\n\n210\n00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:13.230\nYou can do perspective warp to kind of\nchange the way your image is seen in\n\n211\n00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.760\nthat picture.\n\n212\n00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.710\nAlso Free Transform and Transform.\n\n213\n00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:22.110\nThis is what you do if you want to rotate,\nscale, flip anything like\n\n214\n00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.520\nthat where your changing the direction\nof your image is under your Transform.\n\n215\n00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.280\nYou can also set presets\nunder your edit menu as well.\n\n216\n00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.610\nSo you can set brush presets,\nyour Adobe PDF presets,\n\n217\n00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.969\ncolor settings, keyboard shortcuts,\nmenus, toolbars.\n\n218\n00:11:36.969 --> 00:11:40.960\nSo edit is where you go if you want to\nedit what's already in Photoshop as well\n\n219\n00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.890\nas edit your existing document.\n\n220\n00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:47.725\nSo it's a very long list here, you'll\nnotice that this drop down is extensive.\n\n221\n00:11:47.725 --> 00:11:51.230\n[LAUGH] So when in doubt check Edit.\n\n222\n00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.710\n>> Yeah [LAUGH]\n>> Then we have our Image menu.\n\n223\n00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.650\nSo up here we have Image Mode.\n\n224\n00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:04.070\nImage Mode are your color modes, so RGB,\nCMYK, Lab, all of these are here for you.\n\n225\n00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.590\nYou're probably primarily going\nto be designing in RGB or CMYK.\n\n226\n00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:12.830\nSo RGB is what you use for\ndigital screens or digital designs.\n\n227\n00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.890\nCMYK is what you use for print.\n\n228\n00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.000\nThen you have adjustments.\n\n229\n00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.960\nSo adjustments are if you want\nto do something to your image,\n\n230\n00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.100\nlike change the brightness, change\nthe hue, saturation, doing it from this\n\n231\n00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:31.050\nmenu right here, this is going to to\nbe destructively editing your photo.\n\n232\n00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.680\nSo on the exam,\n\n233\n00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.570\nif you're told to destructively\nedit your image by setting a hue or\n\n234\n00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:43.080\nsaturation of 70, you would get to it\nby going to Image Adjustments this way.\n\n235\n00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:43.810\nOkay.\nSo\n\n236\n00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.390\ndestructive means that you're\npermanently altering that image.\n\n237\n00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.490\nThere are other ways in Photoshop\nto do things non-destructively,\n\n238\n00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:51.690\nwhich you will learn about.\n\n239\n00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.581\nBut just keep in mind, as a little nugget.\n\n240\n00:12:53.581 --> 00:12:55.408\n>> [Laugh]\n>> That when you are on the test,\n\n241\n00:12:55.408 --> 00:12:57.530\nthis is where you would go.\n\n242\n00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:01.960\nYou also have Auto Tone, Auto Contrast,\nAuto Color, those are ways for\n\n243\n00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.980\nPhotoshop to automatically\ncorrect your image for you.\n\n244\n00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:09.440\nThen you have Image Size and Canvas Size.\n\n245\n00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.550\nImage Size is the size of your image,\nso let's say that this\n\n246\n00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:18.760\ndocument right here that we have open,\nit's image size would be an 8.5 by 11.\n\n247\n00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.180\nThe canvas size would also be 8.5 by\n11 because they're one and the same.\n\n248\n00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.305\nLet's say that we wanted to\nhave a canvas behind our image.\n\n249\n00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:27.530\nYou could add one.\n\n250\n00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:32.460\nSo let's say that we wanted a matte as if\nit were a photo to be placed in a frame.\n\n251\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.550\nYou could do that by adjusting the canvas.\n\n252\n00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:39.440\nSo the canvas is the largest\npart of your document.\n\n253\n00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.060\nOkay?\n\n254\n00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.620\nSo let's say that we wanted\na canvas to be an inch out\n\n255\n00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:47.490\nfrom our existing picture,\nour existing blank space.\n\n256\n00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.029\nYou can do that under canvas size.\n\n257\n00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.850\nYou can also rotate images\nunder Image as well.\n\n258\n00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:59.410\nIts very similar to your Edit Transform,\nso really either place you wanna go, but\n\n259\n00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.060\nImage Rotation also lets\nyou adjust your canvas.\n\n260\n00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:07.090\nYou can also duplicate,\napply any kind of image that you've done,\n\n261\n00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:10.590\ntrim your document,\ncrop it all under Image.\n\n262\n00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:11.720\nOkay?\n\n263\n00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.660\nNext is your Layer.\n\n264\n00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.750\nSo Layer has an entire panel unto itself.\n\n265\n00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.730\nWe're going to talk about\npanels in just a moment.\n\n266\n00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.960\nSo chances are you're never going\nto go up to this layer menu,\n\n267\n00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:26.060\nbecause there's a much easier way\nto look at layers in a panel.\n\n268\n00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:30.660\nBut if you forget how to access the panel\nand you panic on the test, don't forget to\n\n269\n00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.780\ncheck the words along the top of your\nscreen, cuz it will give you a hint.\n\n270\n00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.820\nSo if you need to do anything with layers,\nthis is where you could go if you\n\n271\n00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.949\nforget how to access your layers panel,\nwhich I'll show you in just a moment.\n\n272\n00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.440\nThen you have your Type menu.\n\n273\n00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.930\nSo Type has to do with anything with text.\n\n274\n00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:52.960\nSo if you need to change your font,if\nyou want to create a character style,\n\n275\n00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.250\na paragraph style,\nthat's all under Panels.\n\n276\n00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.020\nSo Panels,\n\n277\n00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.650\nwhat they are are fly out menus that you\ncan access on your Photoshop screen.\n\n278\n00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:05.860\nI'll be showing you one of those in\njust a moment when we get to Window.\n\n279\n00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:11.240\nSo anything that has to do with text,\nyou'll find it under your Type menu.\n\n280\n00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.570\nIt'll also be in your Panel and\n\n281\n00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:17.520\nalong the top of your screen when\nyou have your Type Tool selected.\n\n282\n00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.940\nSpeaking of selecting there's\nan option called Select.\n\n283\n00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:25.630\nSo Select is where'd you go if you\nwant to do Select All, Deselect,\n\n284\n00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.000\nReselect, Select Inverse.\n\n285\n00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.620\nSo selecting inverse is\nselecting the opposite.\n\n286\n00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.170\nSo let's say that you have\na white piece of paper, and\n\n287\n00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.280\nyou have a pencil in the middle.\n\n288\n00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.850\nYou want to select that white document.\n\n289\n00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:42.510\nWhat you could do is select your pencil.\n\n290\n00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.885\nSelect inverse and\nthen delete your background.\n\n291\n00:15:44.885 --> 00:15:46.470\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n292\n00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:48.941\n>> Okay.\nYou can also select a color range from\n\n293\n00:15:48.941 --> 00:15:50.237\nyour Select menu too.\n\n294\n00:15:50.237 --> 00:15:53.345\nSo if you're asked on your test,\nhey, select a color range.\n\n295\n00:15:53.345 --> 00:15:56.523\nThis is where it's hidden,\nunder your Select menu.\n\n296\n00:15:56.523 --> 00:16:01.842\nKey, if it starts with select, maybe you\nwanna check your menu, see if it's there.\n\n297\n00:16:01.842 --> 00:16:06.705\nYou can also find masking options here,\nwhich we'll be talking about,\n\n298\n00:16:06.705 --> 00:16:10.451\nas well as editing in Quick Mask,\nloading selections,\n\n299\n00:16:10.451 --> 00:16:14.218\nsaving selections,\nit's all under your Select menu.\n\n300\n00:16:14.218 --> 00:16:17.310\nOur next menu is something called Filter.\n\n301\n00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.139\nSo Filter's a really powerful menu.\n\n302\n00:16:20.139 --> 00:16:23.879\nSo it's where you would go if you wanted\nto make edits, let's say that you wanted\n\n303\n00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:28.590\nto make your picture look like it's been\npainted, you could go to your Filter menu.\n\n304\n00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:33.320\nYou could also do things like add a blur\nto your overall image by going to your\n\n305\n00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.930\nFilter menu as well.\n\n306\n00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:39.486\nThere's a whole filter gallery in here,\nwhere you can actually click through and\n\n307\n00:16:39.486 --> 00:16:42.270\nsee what the filters are going\nto do to your image.\n\n308\n00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.262\n>> Nice.\n\n309\n00:16:43.262 --> 00:16:44.454\n>> Then I have 3D.\n\n310\n00:16:44.454 --> 00:16:48.467\nSo 3D is where you'd wanna go if you\nare creating some kind of 3D design in\n\n311\n00:16:48.467 --> 00:16:49.810\nPhotoshop.\n\n312\n00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:54.260\nPhotoshop CC has very powerful 3D tools,\nso if 3D design is something that you're\n\n313\n00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.240\ninterested in,\nthis is where you'd find more information.\n\n314\n00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.950\nThen we have our View menu.\n\n315\n00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:06.440\nSo View has everything from zooming in,\nzooming out, to setting up proofs for\n\n316\n00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.710\nprinting.\n\n317\n00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:10.960\nIt's all the different ways that\nyou can view your document.\n\n318\n00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.100\nSo proof setup is where you would go if,\nlet's say that you wanted\n\n319\n00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.970\nto see exactly what it would like\nwhen you sent it to a printer.\n\n320\n00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:21.800\nYou would go to Proof Setup, pull up your\nproof colors, all of that's there for you.\n\n321\n00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.370\nZooming in and out,\nyou can do from this View menu.\n\n322\n00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:30.110\nBut there are so many different ways\nto zoom in and out on Photoshop.\n\n323\n00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:33.931\nI recommend you find a faster way,\nso maybe Cmd +,\n\n324\n00:17:33.931 --> 00:17:37.952\nCmd Ctrl +, Ctrl- is to zoom in and out.\n\n325\n00:17:37.952 --> 00:17:40.460\nYou can also change\nthe percentage on your window.\n\n326\n00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.220\nYou can do all sorts of different things.\n\n327\n00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.090\nThe magnifying tool, just lots and lots of\ndifferent options in Photoshop for you.\n\n328\n00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.480\nAlso under the View menu,\nyou have your rulers and guides.\n\n329\n00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.580\nSo rulers are what I\nhave enabled right now.\n\n330\n00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:56.330\nIf you look at the top of my screen,\nyou'll see these numbers here.\n\n331\n00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:00.240\nThis is a ruler, this is helpful\nif you're trying to figure out\n\n332\n00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.360\nexactly where you want\nto place something or\n\n333\n00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:08.400\nhow large something should be in relation\nto something else, a ruler is helpful.\n\n334\n00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.633\nYou also have your guides\nunder here as well.\n\n335\n00:18:10.633 --> 00:18:13.572\nSo if you wanted to create a guide,\nwhat that is,\n\n336\n00:18:13.572 --> 00:18:16.171\nis it lets you set\na point on your document.\n\n337\n00:18:16.171 --> 00:18:20.995\nLet's say that you wanted to find the\nmidpoint of your document, you can drag it\n\n338\n00:18:20.995 --> 00:18:26.190\nover from your ruler, set it, and then you\ncan align all of your objects to it, okay.\n\n339\n00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:32.090\nSo New Guide, Lock Guide, they're\nall at the bottom of your View menu.\n\n340\n00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.304\nThen you have this Window, so\n\n341\n00:18:34.304 --> 00:18:38.590\nWindow is where you would go\nif you need to find a panel.\n\n342\n00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.020\nSo I mentioned panels before,\nthey're little fly out menus.\n\n343\n00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:45.210\nIf you don't have them up already,\ngo to Window to enable them.\n\n344\n00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:50.030\nSo this shows you all of your different\npanel options, there are a ton of them.\n\n345\n00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:53.000\nSo if you're looking for\nCharacter, Paragraph, Brush,\n\n346\n00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.910\nthey're all here under Window.\n\n347\n00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:58.770\nAt the top of Window,\nyou'll see that you have Window Arrange.\n\n348\n00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:02.650\nWindow Arrange allows you to set\nhow you want to view your files.\n\n349\n00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.520\nSo let's say that you\nhave four pictures open,\n\n350\n00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.710\nthey all show up as little tabs\nacross the top of your screen.\n\n351\n00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.090\nIf you don't want them\nto show up like that,\n\n352\n00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:14.960\nyou can say to tile horizontally, four up,\n\n353\n00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.190\nsix up, consolidate all to tabs, all\nsorts of different things for you there.\n\n354\n00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.970\nThis is a designer's preference, so\n\n355\n00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:25.400\nif you don't like the way that Photoshop's\ndefaulted, you can change that there.\n\n356\n00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.160\nAlso under Window is an option for\nWork Space.\n\n357\n00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.760\nSo Work Space are all the default\npreferences that are already in Photoshop.\n\n358\n00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.190\nYou were probably on Essentials Default,\nwhich is fine.\n\n359\n00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:37.720\nIf you're not, you can change to it or\n\n360\n00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.060\nstay in whatever kind of work\nspace you're in currently.\n\n361\n00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:44.060\nSo let's say that you were\ndesigning motion graphics.\n\n362\n00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:49.130\nSo doing some kind of video editing, you\nmight want your work space to say Motion.\n\n363\n00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:53.920\nOr if you're doing work space and you are\na painter, you're an artist, you're doing\n\n364\n00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:58.830\na lot of painting in Photoshop,\nyou can go to Painting here, as well.\n\n365\n00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:03.670\nOkay, so what that does is it sets what\nkind of panels it thinks you need.\n\n366\n00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.260\nYou can also set your own work space too.\n\n367\n00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.440\nSo if you like your work\nspace to look a certain way,\n\n368\n00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.480\nkind of like how people organize\ntheir desks, it's a very similar way.\n\n369\n00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.010\nYou can pick what tools you want where,\nwhat panels you want where,\n\n370\n00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.500\nwhat colors you want.\n\n371\n00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.720\nIt's all available for you.\n\n372\n00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.480\nPhotoshop's an extremely\ncustomizable work space.\n\n373\n00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.460\nThen you have your Help menu.\n\n374\n00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.450\nSo this is where you'd go if you\nwanted to search for an answer.\n\n375\n00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.305\nAnd you didn't want to look it up online,\n\n376\n00:20:29.305 --> 00:20:32.590\n[LAUGH] you can look it up\nhere under Help and Search.\n\n377\n00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.460\nSo that is your main menu in Photoshop.\n\n378\n00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.260\nSo any questions so\nfar with the main menu before we move on?\n\n379\n00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.700\n>> No, a lot of options there.\n\n380\n00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.220\nBut I can see we're familiarizing myself\nwith where things are will make it much\n\n381\n00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.600\neasier to work with\nthe product in the future.\n\n382\n00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.870\n>> It definitely does, definitely does.\n\n383\n00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:53.370\nSo let me direct your attention to\nthe far left of the screen now.\n\n384\n00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.260\nFar left over here,\nthis is your tool panel.\n\n385\n00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.270\nThis is where all your tools are located.\n\n386\n00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:59.980\nSo if you're trying to\ndo something specific,\n\n387\n00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.270\nlike use a paintbrush,\nthis is where you'd go to find it.\n\n388\n00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.510\nNow your tool menu might\nlook different than mine.\n\n389\n00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.310\nI have mine double stacked.\n\n390\n00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:11.250\nIf you like it like this, you can just\nhit these double arrows on the left.\n\n391\n00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:16.670\nI'm going to collapse mine just so\nit's easier for you all to see.\n\n392\n00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:21.030\nBut if you ever see those two arrows, it\njust means that you can expand something\n\n393\n00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:24.240\nor contract it,\ndepending on what you need to do.\n\n394\n00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.574\nAll right, so I'm going to quickly go over\nwhere these tools are and briefly explain\n\n395\n00:21:28.574 --> 00:21:32.173\nthem, but we are going to be going\nover each of these tools in depth, so\n\n396\n00:21:32.173 --> 00:21:33.296\ndon't worry there.\n\n397\n00:21:33.296 --> 00:21:37.670\n[COUGH] All right,\nlet's go over this first tool.\n\n398\n00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:39.910\nSo this first tool is your Move Tool.\n\n399\n00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:41.670\nIt might look slightly\ndifferent on your end.\n\n400\n00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.100\nIt will have an arrow\nattached to it in some way.\n\n401\n00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.815\nPhotoshop keeps changing what the move\ntool looks like for some reason.\n\n402\n00:21:46.815 --> 00:21:48.999\nIt's changed twice in the last six months.\n\n403\n00:21:48.999 --> 00:21:50.157\nI don't know why.\n\n404\n00:21:50.157 --> 00:21:50.937\n>> Really?\n\n405\n00:21:50.937 --> 00:21:52.085\n>> Yes, but it has changed.\n\n406\n00:21:52.085 --> 00:21:55.230\n[LAUGH] Move Tool allows you to\nmove something on your document.\n\n407\n00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:59.360\nThen you have your Artboard Tool,\nwhich is a new thing in Photoshop CC.\n\n408\n00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.660\nArtboards are something that's\nused in programs like Illustrator,\n\n409\n00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:07.550\nwhere you want to have multiple\ndocuments available in one file.\n\n410\n00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:09.350\nPhotoshop didn't used to\nallow you to do that.\n\n411\n00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.070\nNow it does.\n\n412\n00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:13.440\nThat is your Artboard Tool, okay?\n\n413\n00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.910\nGoing to the immediate right,\nthese are your Marquee Tools.\n\n414\n00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:19.420\nMarquee Tools are selection tools.\n\n415\n00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:23.150\nSo if you wanted to select a very\nparticular part of an image,\n\n416\n00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:24.010\nyou could do that here.\n\n417\n00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:26.510\nSo if you wanted to select\na button off of a shirt,\n\n418\n00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.920\nyou could use the Elliptical Marquee Tool.\n\n419\n00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.530\nYou could copy it, you could edit it,\nyou could do whatever you want.\n\n420\n00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.850\nIt's just a way to select.\n\n421\n00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:38.170\nAnother way to select is\nwith the Lasso Tools.\n\n422\n00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:42.290\nSo you have your regular lasso,\npolygonal, and then magnetic lasso.\n\n423\n00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:45.270\nThese are ways for you to be more\nspecific with your selections.\n\n424\n00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:46.680\nSo you can actually click, hold,\n\n425\n00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.400\ndrag around, get something more\nspecific than just a geometric shape.\n\n426\n00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:56.196\nTo the right of that, we have another way\nto select as your Quick Selection Tool and\n\n427\n00:22:56.196 --> 00:22:56.829\nMagic Wand.\n\n428\n00:22:56.829 --> 00:23:01.729\nThe Quick Selection Tool allows you\nto drag a brush over an image and\n\n429\n00:23:01.729 --> 00:23:05.258\nselect specific parts that you want.\n\n430\n00:23:05.258 --> 00:23:09.108\nThe Magic Wand Tool works in a similar\nway, it picks up similar colors, so\n\n431\n00:23:09.108 --> 00:23:12.461\nthat way, you can kind of quickly\nremove a white background, or\n\n432\n00:23:12.461 --> 00:23:15.404\nyou can select similar parts\nof an image based on color.\n\n433\n00:23:15.404 --> 00:23:18.740\nTo the left, we have our Crop Tool.\n\n434\n00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.140\nSo the Crop Tool is a way to\ndestructively change your image.\n\n435\n00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.730\nSo it's like taking a pair of scissors and\ncutting off the bottom of a picture.\n\n436\n00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:28.980\nThat's what a Crop Tool does.\n\n437\n00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.370\nSo you have Crop,\nPerspective Crop and then slicing.\n\n438\n00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:37.170\nSlicing is something that you do if\nyou want to create images for the web.\n\n439\n00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:40.579\nSo if you wanted to design\nsome buttons in Photoshop,\n\n440\n00:23:40.579 --> 00:23:42.941\nyou can slice them out for use on web.\n\n441\n00:23:42.941 --> 00:23:46.134\nOkay, to the right of that tool, we have\nthe Eyedropper Tool, the Ruler Tool,\n\n442\n00:23:46.134 --> 00:23:48.400\nthe Note Tool, the Count Tool.\n\n443\n00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.418\nThese are ways for\nyou to organize your document.\n\n444\n00:23:51.418 --> 00:23:52.621\nOkay, so using notes, so\n\n445\n00:23:52.621 --> 00:23:56.465\nnotes would be something that you'd use if\nyou wanted to leave a note for yourself.\n\n446\n00:23:56.465 --> 00:24:00.428\nIf you're leaving for the day at work and\nYou wanna remember where you left off,\n\n447\n00:24:00.428 --> 00:24:02.690\nyou can leave yourself\na little sticky note.\n\n448\n00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:03.689\n>> Handy.\n[LAUGH]\n\n449\n00:24:03.689 --> 00:24:04.455\n>> Yes.\n\n450\n00:24:04.455 --> 00:24:08.240\nBut what you're probably going to be using\nthe most from here is the eyedropper tool.\n\n451\n00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.840\nThe eyedropper tool allows\nyou to select colors, okay?\n\n452\n00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.580\nThen, to the far left,\nwe have our healing brush tools.\n\n453\n00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.820\nThis is where you would go if you wanted\nto remove a blemish off of a face,\n\n454\n00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.410\nif you wanted to move\nsomething out of a picture.\n\n455\n00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:24.490\nYou can do that here.\n\n456\n00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.540\nThen we have our brush tool.\n\n457\n00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.900\nSo, the brush tool has your brush tools,\nyour pencil tools,\n\n458\n00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.970\nyour color replacement tools,\nyour mixer brushes.\n\n459\n00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.960\nThey are all here for you.\n\n460\n00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.930\nThis is what you think of when you\nremember playing with Paint as a kid,\n\n461\n00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:41.480\non Windows maybe.\n\n462\n00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.380\nThis is very similar to that,\nbut it has a lot more options.\n\n463\n00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.190\nYou can create really beautiful artistic\ndesigns with your brush tool in Photoshop.\n\n464\n00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.370\nThen you have your clone stamp tool or\npattern stamp tool.\n\n465\n00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:56.870\nThat allows you to copy certain parts of\nan image and paste it over another part.\n\n466\n00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.210\nThen you have your history brush tool,\nart history brush tool.\n\n467\n00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:04.420\nThese are something that you\nprobably wouldn't use all that much,\n\n468\n00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.340\nbut if for some reason you're ever\nasked to do it, here they are.\n\n469\n00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.930\nWe're going to be demonstrating\nwhat they do later on.\n\n470\n00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.390\nThen you have your eraser tool.\n\n471\n00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:17.270\nSo, the eraser tool allows you to\ndestructively remove parts of an image.\n\n472\n00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:21.650\nSo, if you wanted to remove\na line that you'd drawn,\n\n473\n00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:23.260\nyou could use your eraser tool for it.\n\n474\n00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:28.660\nThen you have your paint bucket tool and\ngradient tools.\n\n475\n00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:34.620\nThe gradient tool allows you to create\na fading effect on an image, okay?\n\n476\n00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.241\nThe paint bucket tool allows\nyou to fill an area with color.\n\n477\n00:25:39.764 --> 00:25:42.740\nOkay?\nThen, here you have your blur, sharpen and\n\n478\n00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:43.290\nsmudge tools.\n\n479\n00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:47.330\nThese are a way to edit photos if you\nwanted to blur something out, smudge it,\n\n480\n00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.240\nif you wanted to sharpen something so\n\n481\n00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.690\nyou could read it better,\nthis is where you would go.\n\n482\n00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.640\nSimilar to those tools is you have\nthe dodge, burn and sponge tools.\n\n483\n00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.460\nThese either brighten parts of an image,\ndarken parts of an image, or\n\n484\n00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.620\nadd saturation to an image.\n\n485\n00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.850\nLike I said, we are going to\nbe practicing all of these.\n\n486\n00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.860\nThis is probably going way over your head.\n\n487\n00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.950\nJust try to remember where they are,\nthat's the key point here.\n\n488\n00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.130\nThen you have your pen tool.\n\n489\n00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:17.040\nThe pen tool allows you to create\nvery specific selections, or\n\n490\n00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.320\nto draw something out.\n\n491\n00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:23.540\nThe pen tool is pretty much\nthe fundamental basis of Illustrator.\n\n492\n00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.820\nSo, if you're familiar with Illustrator,\nthis is very similar.\n\n493\n00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.020\nThen you have your T or your type tool.\n\n494\n00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.610\nThis is where you would go\nif you wanted to add text.\n\n495\n00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.370\nSo you can add horizontal text,\n\n496\n00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:37.850\nyou can add vertical text,\nyou can do masking text.\n\n497\n00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:39.407\nIt's all there for you.\n\n498\n00:26:40.936 --> 00:26:42.520\nThen you have your arrow tools.\n\n499\n00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.090\nThese are ways for you to select paths.\n\n500\n00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:47.449\nSo if you've created\na path with the pen tool,\n\n501\n00:26:47.449 --> 00:26:50.789\nthis is where you would go to move\nthose paths or edit those paths.\n\n502\n00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.590\nThen you have your shape tool.\n\n503\n00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:57.806\nThe shape tool allows you to create shapes\nlike circles, and squares, and lines, and\n\n504\n00:26:57.806 --> 00:26:58.629\ncustom shapes.\n\n505\n00:27:00.663 --> 00:27:04.720\nThe hand tool down here,\nit allows you to pan across your document.\n\n506\n00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.690\nSo if you have a huge image, let's say\nit's a picture of the Grand Canyon,\n\n507\n00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:12.490\nit's massive, that you took on your\ndigital camera, you want to zoom in and\n\n508\n00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.940\nmove so you can see this\nparticular animal on the ridge.\n\n509\n00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.521\nYou could do that with your hand tool.\n\n510\n00:27:19.056 --> 00:27:23.368\nThen you have your little magnifying\nglass which allows you to zoom, okay?\n\n511\n00:27:23.368 --> 00:27:26.550\nSo, there is a tool for it,\nyou can also use a shortcut for it.\n\n512\n00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:28.350\nIt's all there for you.\n\n513\n00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:31.220\nAt the bottom of your panel,\nthese are your colors here,\n\n514\n00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.640\nit's your foreground and\nbackground colors.\n\n515\n00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:38.020\nSo if you're trying to figure out where\nto change the color, there you go.\n\n516\n00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:43.190\nNow there's one more thing I wanted to\nshow you before we end today's lesson, and\n\n517\n00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:44.630\nthat's where your panels are.\n\n518\n00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.320\nSo I've mentioned what panels are,\nlet's look at them.\n\n519\n00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:51.170\nSo over on the far right is\nwhere you have your panels.\n\n520\n00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:53.380\nSo if you were to click on Layers,\n\n521\n00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.950\nyou'd see that you have a little fly\nout menu that gives you more options.\n\n522\n00:27:56.950 --> 00:28:01.420\nSo if you needed to create a new layer,\nadjust a layer, this is where you'd go.\n\n523\n00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:07.480\nIf we click on color, you'll see how\nyou can select color, change color.\n\n524\n00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.850\nIf you click on swatches,\n\n525\n00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:13.220\nthis is where you'd go to find colors\nthat are already in Photoshop.\n\n526\n00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.130\nYou can also create your own color swatch.\n\n527\n00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.540\nSo let's say that you\nare creating work for\n\n528\n00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:20.770\nan existing brand and\nthey have a particular color swatch.\n\n529\n00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:24.150\nYou can add that swatch to your\nPhotoshop swatches panel so\n\n530\n00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:27.915\nthat way you have access to that exact\nsame color whenever you're doing design.\n\n531\n00:28:27.915 --> 00:28:33.190\nSo, again, if you're ever missing\na panel or you want to add a panel,\n\n532\n00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:37.930\nwhat you do is you go to window and panels\nand you can select whatever one you want.\n\n533\n00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:44.310\nSo let's try, I'll just add,\nlet's do styles.\n\n534\n00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.713\nSo styles, you can either drag it out.\n\n535\n00:28:48.875 --> 00:28:51.530\nYou can expand it, collapse it.\n\n536\n00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:52.800\nYou can pull it back in.\n\n537\n00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:57.970\nPhotoshop is extremely flexible in how\nyou want it to arrange your workspace.\n\n538\n00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:01.930\nAnd that is an introduction\nto our Photoshop workspace.\n\n539\n00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:03.080\n>> Fantastic, Cara.\n\n540\n00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.490\nGreat tour of the interface.\n\n541\n00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:07.520\nLike we said at the very beginning,\na relatively complex application,\n\n542\n00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.770\nimportant that we can find our way around,\nfind the tools we need,\n\n543\n00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:14.530\nknow what menus options are under so\nthat we can work effectively.\n\n544\n00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:17.750\nAnd as Cara pointed out several times,\nwanna be able to pass that exam as well.\n\n545\n00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:19.490\nSo we thank you for that tour, Cara.\n\n546\n00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:22.230\nCan't wait to dive in and\nlearn more about Photoshop.\n\n547\n00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.260\nBut that's gonna have to\nwait til our next episode.\n\n548\n00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.790\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n549\n00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:27.420\n>> And I'm Cara Page.\n\n550\n00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:29.638\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n551\n00:29:29.638 --> 00:29:37.370\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.410\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.500\ntoday we're gonna be going\nover Adobe Photoshop CC.\n\n5\n00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.030\nAnd in particular, in this episode,\nwe're gonna be focusing in on\n\n6\n00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.550\nworking with different types of documents,\ncreating new documents, importing and\n\n7\n00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.060\nexporting documents, or\nwe gonna save those documents and then\n\n8\n00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.860\nof course all the different file types,\nso we can save those documents it hasn't.\n\n9\n00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.900\nHere to help us with all\nthat is Miss Cara Page.\n\n10\n00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.460\nHow's it going, Cara?\n\n11\n00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.290\n>> I'm great!\n\n12\n00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.270\nHow are you?\n>> Good, thanks!\n\n13\n00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.830\nGood.\nSo are we ready to get started?\n\n14\n00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.570\n>> Yes, let's do it.\n\n15\n00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.090\n>> Okay.\n\n16\n00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.850\nSo the first thing that we're going to go\nover today is we are going to be going\n\n17\n00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.470\nover how to even open a file,\nso how to start from fresh.\n\n18\n00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.271\n>> That's a great starting point.\n\n19\n00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:54.679\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n20\n00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.745\nAll right, so let's go ahead on\nto the computer screen now, and\n\n21\n00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:00.710\nopen Photoshop if you don't\nhave it open already.\n\n22\n00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.380\nSo you'll notice here with CC, it shows\nmy most recent files up on the homepage.\n\n23\n00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.640\nTo the left, you'll see New, Open.\n\n24\n00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.960\nIf yours doesn't look exactly like this,\ndon't worry, the file menu is your friend.\n\n25\n00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.282\nThat's where New is located.\n\n26\n00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:17.490\n[LAUGH] All right, so let's go ahead and\nclick that New button and\n\n27\n00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.190\nsee what happens.\n\n28\n00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.490\nSo there,\nwe have this little pop-up that comes up.\n\n29\n00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.760\nThe first space that we need to enter\nis where the naming convention is.\n\n30\n00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.810\nYou'll see right now it\nsays name Untitled-1.\n\n31\n00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.300\nSo let's go ahead and name this something.\n\n32\n00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.510\nSo let's name this Practice.\n\n33\n00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.190\nOkay?\n\n34\n00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.600\nYou'll see right underneath that,\nwe have Document Type.\n\n35\n00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.850\nSo if you click on the dropdown,\n\n36\n00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.510\nyou'll see all of the different menu\ntype options you have available.\n\n37\n00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.220\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nselect US Paper.\n\n38\n00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.810\nUS Paper has its own default, so right\nthere you'll see that we have letter,\n\n39\n00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.090\nlegal, tabloid,\nthose are all your standard paper sizes.\n\n40\n00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.964\nIt makes it very quick and\n\n41\n00:01:54.964 --> 00:01:56.780\neasy when you're going to,\n>> Absolutely.\n\n42\n00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.380\n>> to make a file.\n\n43\n00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.520\nSo, you'll notice that this already\ndefaulted to 8.5 x 11 inches,\n\n44\n00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.740\nthat's because that is\nthe default US paper letter size.\n\n45\n00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.720\nIf we wanted to change the size,\nwe can do so right here.\n\n46\n00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.540\nSo, we can change it to, let's say 10.\n\n47\n00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.700\nAnd you'll notice at the top,\n\n48\n00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.460\nit's changed to custom instead of\npaper now as our document type.\n\n49\n00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.730\nSo whenever you stray a little bit,\nit'll change to a custom type file format.\n\n50\n00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.380\nTo the right of the 10 or 11,\nyou'll see different options for\n\n51\n00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.060\nwhat kind of convention you want to use.\n\n52\n00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.830\nSo whether it wants to be pixels, inches,\n\n53\n00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.360\ncentimeters, millimeters,\nit's completely up to you.\n\n54\n00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.140\nI'm going to stick to inches but\n\n55\n00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.730\nin the future we're going to be primarily\nfocusing on pixels for computer purposes.\n\n56\n00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.290\nOkay, so let's do inches.\n\n57\n00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.920\n>> Does it make a difference as far as\nwhat you're gonna be doing with this\n\n58\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.760\ndocument in the end?\n\n59\n00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.870\nPrinting it versus maybe like a website?\n\n60\n00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.525\n>> Yes and no.\n\n61\n00:02:48.525 --> 00:02:53.057\n[LAUGH] It kinda depends on your purpose\nhow you know what the dimensions are.\n\n62\n00:02:53.057 --> 00:02:57.970\nCause if you're doing print, your printer\nis going to ask inches most likely.\n\n63\n00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.360\nIf it's for web, it will be in pixels, but\nyou can easily convert back and forth.\n\n64\n00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.050\nSo if you notice, if I change inches to\npixels, it will automatically convert for\n\n65\n00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.670\nus there.\n\n66\n00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.930\nRight under that,\nyou'll see the resolution.\n\n67\n00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.140\nOur resolution is how sharp\nour image is going to be.\n\n68\n00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.780\nSo, the default for print is 300.\n\n69\n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.900\nThe default for web is 72.\n\n70\n00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.300\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\n71\n00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.450\nIf you are going to print, make sure that\nyou do have your resolution set at 300, or\n\n72\n00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.713\nelse when you go to print, it's gonna\nlook very pixellated if it's at 72.\n\n73\n00:03:29.713 --> 00:03:31.525\n[LAUGH] So keep that in mind.\n\n74\n00:03:31.525 --> 00:03:33.810\nThen right beneath that,\nyou'll see our color modes.\n\n75\n00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.840\nSo the standard for print is CMYK, and\n\n76\n00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.540\nthen for our more digital type formats,\nthat's RGB.\n\n77\n00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.010\nYou'll notice we can also\ndo Grayscale there as well.\n\n78\n00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.490\nThose are your three most\ncommon uses in Photoshop.\n\n79\n00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.860\nRight beneath that,\nyou'll see Background Contents.\n\n80\n00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.960\nSo, it defaults to white for US Paper.\n\n81\n00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.890\nSo, white would just be\na standard sheet of paper.\n\n82\n00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.510\nYou can also choose a background color or\nhave it be transparent.\n\n83\n00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.740\nSo transparency is great if you're\ndesigning something like a logo\n\n84\n00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.510\nthat doesn't have a background.\n\n85\n00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.210\nThat allows you to create that\ndocument without the white there.\n\n86\n00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.900\nOkay, all right, I'm going to go ahead and\nopen up this document.\n\n87\n00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.870\nSo I'm gonna change it\nback to an 8.5 by 11.\n\n88\n00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.660\nI'm going to go ahead and\nclick OK in the top right corner.\n\n89\n00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.380\nAnd there you have it.\n\n90\n00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.330\nWe have our new blank canvas.\n\n91\n00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.510\n>> Very good.\nVery good.\n\n92\n00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.830\nSo now we can get busy and play.\n\n93\n00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.770\n>> Exactly.\n\n94\n00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.970\nSo this is how you create a new file.\n\n95\n00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.950\nNow what if you want to\nopen an existing file?\n\n96\n00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.355\n>> Hm.\n>> We need to figure out how to do that.\n\n97\n00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:33.730\n>> Um-hm.\n>> So if you're a photographer,\n\n98\n00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.150\nyou have a lot of great photos.\n\n99\n00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.895\nHow do you open them?\n\n100\n00:04:35.895 --> 00:04:36.420\n[LAUGH]\n>> Um-hm.\n\n101\n00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.440\n>> So let's do that.\n\n102\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.210\nSo we're gonna go to file.\n\n103\n00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.840\nAnd this time, instead of clicking on New,\nwe're going to click on Open.\n\n104\n00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.330\nSo let's go ahead and click on Open.\n\n105\n00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.230\nAnd there, you'll be able to\nsee your different files.\n\n106\n00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.390\nNow this is where file naming and\nfile placement becomes really important.\n\n107\n00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.170\nYou need to know where your files\nare stored on the computer in\n\n108\n00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.650\norder to be able to find them.\n\n109\n00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.025\n>> Yes, I've lost several documents.\n\n110\n00:04:59.025 --> 00:05:01.270\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's a scary thing when that happens.\n\n111\n00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.720\n[LAUGH] So I'm gonna go ahead and\njust place this image of Colorado in here,\n\n112\n00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.490\njust so you can see what it looks like.\n\n113\n00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.160\nSo let's go to Open, and\nthere's our lovely picture of Colorado.\n\n114\n00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.140\n>> So giving it a name that kind of\nrepresents what the picture is of,\n\n115\n00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.680\nhelps you figure out\nwhich one you wanna open,\n\n116\n00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.980\nand then maybe having a common place to\nstore everything makes it easier to find.\n\n117\n00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.100\n>> Exactly, definitely does.\n\n118\n00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.060\nAll right, I'm gonna go back\nto that document that we did\n\n119\n00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.990\ncreate, the 8.5 by 11.\n\n120\n00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.000\nCuz I'm gonna show you how to place\nsomething into this document.\n\n121\n00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.790\nSo it's almost as if\nwe're pasting it in here.\n\n122\n00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.450\n>> Hm.\n\n123\n00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.090\n>> Okay.\n\n124\n00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.200\nSo there's several ways to do it.\n\n125\n00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.770\nI'm gonna go over the first one\nwhich is going to the File menu, and\n\n126\n00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.900\ngoing to Place.\n\n127\n00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.430\nNow you'll notice we have two options for\nPlace, Place Embedded and Place Linked.\n\n128\n00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.540\nThe standard kind of what's been going on\nforever with Photoshop is Place Embedded.\n\n129\n00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.920\nSo, if your Photoshop\ndoes not have Embedded or\n\n130\n00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.530\nLinked, Embedded is the same thing.\n\n131\n00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.830\nLinked has just been recently added for\nCC.\n\n132\n00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.850\nLinked means that if you were to edit\nthe file in a different program,\n\n133\n00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.340\nlike Illustrator, then you would be able\nto update it throughout the programs.\n\n134\n00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.800\n>> Okay, so\nit remains linked to the original.\n\n135\n00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.590\nSo, if you modify the original,\n\n136\n00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.690\nthen those changes would show up in\nall the places that it was linked.\n\n137\n00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:14.230\n>> Precisely.\n\n138\n00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.040\nThat's exactly how it works.\n\n139\n00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.670\nI'm just gonna do our\nstandard Place Embedded.\n\n140\n00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.650\nSo let's go to Place Embedded,\nand let's go ahead and\n\n141\n00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.160\nplace a different picture of Colorado.\n\n142\n00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.510\nSo I'm gonna do Colorado3 here.\n\n143\n00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.689\nGo ahead and place.\n\n144\n00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.920\nAnd there, we have this image.\n\n145\n00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.970\nNow, you'll notice that we have\nthis box around the image.\n\n146\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.900\nThis is called a bounding box.\n\n147\n00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.480\nIt shows you all of your active pixels and\nthe dimensions of them.\n\n148\n00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.590\nSo, if I wanted to just place it,\nI would have to commit that place.\n\n149\n00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.400\nSo you can click on the check\nbox up at the top, or\n\n150\n00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.440\nyou can go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n151\n00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.270\nI highly recommend you do Enter.\n\n152\n00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.128\nIt'll save you a mouse click.\n\n153\n00:06:50.128 --> 00:06:51.152\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n154\n00:06:51.152 --> 00:06:52.160\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so\n\n155\n00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.240\nthat is placing from file place.\n\n156\n00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.830\nNow what if I wanted to\nbring over this Colorado\n\n157\n00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.010\none picture that we have\nopen in our other tab?\n\n158\n00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.230\nWe can definitely do that.\n\n159\n00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.510\nWhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna click on the tab.\n\n160\n00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.120\nAnd I'm going to make sure\nmy Move tool is selected.\n\n161\n00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.480\nIt is your top left tool, it's\nthe one that has the four sided arrow.\n\n162\n00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.790\nSo you'll notice that when I hover over\nthis image, the Move tool is present.\n\n163\n00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.960\nSo I'm going to click, hold, drag over\nto my other document, and let go.\n\n164\n00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.900\n>> Hm, nice.\n\n165\n00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.810\nSo this image is a little bit large,\nwhich is fine.\n\n166\n00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.630\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n167\n00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.580\nmove it down, cuz we're not\ndoing anything with this file.\n\n168\n00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.200\nIt's just for demonstration purposes.\n\n169\n00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.530\nBut here, I'm going to go ahead and\ncommit that change.\n\n170\n00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.000\nso that way,\nPhotoshop will let me do things further.\n\n171\n00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.550\n>> Very good\n>> Any questions so far?\n\n172\n00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.270\n>> No, I think I got it.\n\n173\n00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:42.770\nIt's pretty easy, just drag it up to\nthe tab which then made the program switch\n\n174\n00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:47.210\nover to that tab, and then went back\ndown and dropped it on the old picture.\n\n175\n00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.835\n>> Yes, precisely.\n\n176\n00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:51.675\nThe other way that you\ncan place your photos, or\n\n177\n00:07:51.675 --> 00:07:54.705\nwhatever kind of file into Photoshop,\nis by copying and pasting.\n\n178\n00:07:54.705 --> 00:07:57.335\nJust your standard copy and\npaste that you do all the time.\n\n179\n00:07:57.335 --> 00:08:00.195\n>> So I could copy from any other source,\nlike the web, if I had gone and\n\n180\n00:08:00.195 --> 00:08:03.355\nsearched for an image, or\nhad some other source?\n\n181\n00:08:03.355 --> 00:08:04.255\n>> Yes.\nYou certainly can.\n\n182\n00:08:04.255 --> 00:08:07.405\nYou can even copy and\npaste from other Adobe programs.\n\n183\n00:08:07.405 --> 00:08:10.455\nSo if you learn 'illustrator',\nyou can copy and paste over, or\n\n184\n00:08:10.455 --> 00:08:11.765\nyou could do file Place\n>> Okay,\n\n185\n00:08:11.765 --> 00:08:14.100\nvery good\n>> Okay?\n\n186\n00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.760\nAll right.\n\n187\n00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.660\nSo, let's say that I wanted to\nview my tabs in a different way.\n\n188\n00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.250\nWe can do that.\n\n189\n00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.450\nWe're gonna go up to\nthe Window menu up at the top,\n\n190\n00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.580\nand you'll see we have\nan option to Arrange.\n\n191\n00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.480\nUnder Arrange, we can decide whether\nwe want them to be vertical, so\n\n192\n00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.200\nthey're side-by-side which might make the\ndragging and dropping even easier for you.\n\n193\n00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.370\n>> Mm.\nCuz then you don't have to drag it up to\n\n194\n00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.800\nthe tab first to have it switch over.\n\n195\n00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.620\nYou can just drag it from\none screen to the other?\n\n196\n00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.140\n>> Exactly.\n\n197\n00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.410\n>> Nice.\n>> Exactly.\n\n198\n00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.320\nPhotoshop is extremely customizable.\n\n199\n00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.810\nFind what you like and\nthen just commit to it.\n\n200\n00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:43.300\n>> Very good.\n\n201\n00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.210\n>> All right, so let's go ahead and\ntalk about copying and\n\n202\n00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.760\npasting a little bit more.\n\n203\n00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.690\nSo let's pretend I did have an image\nI wanted to copy and paste.\n\n204\n00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.500\nI found something great online,\njust this awesome photo.\n\n205\n00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.110\nI want to add it to my Colorado picture.\n\n206\n00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.040\nMaybe it's the state flag, I don't know.\n\n207\n00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.820\nSo we found the state flag on Google,\nI'm going to right click to Copy and\n\n208\n00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.140\nthen I'm going to come to Photoshop and if\nI had copied something, so let's go ahead\n\n209\n00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:14.422\nand maybe let's go find a Colorado\nstate flag just for fun.\n\n210\n00:09:14.422 --> 00:09:17.893\n>> What is on the Colorado state flag?\n\n211\n00:09:17.893 --> 00:09:21.177\n>> A C.\n>> A very good.\n\n212\n00:09:21.177 --> 00:09:24.180\n[LAUGH]\n>> A lesson on state flags today.\n\n213\n00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.300\nSo we're gonna copy, and\nwe're gonna come in, and paste.\n\n214\n00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.220\nNow, if I hadn't done it that way, what\nI could do is create a whole new file.\n\n215\n00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.310\nSo we're gonna go to File > New,\nand you'll notice\n\n216\n00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:40.170\nthat the document type's going to default\nto clipboard when you copy and paste.\n\n217\n00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.850\nWhat that means is whenever\nsomething's on your clipboard,\n\n218\n00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.850\nwhich means you have it copied,\nPhotoshop knows its dimensions.\n\n219\n00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.540\n>> Nice.\nSo it's actually picked up the fact you've\n\n220\n00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:53.200\ncopied something and it's went ahead and\nset your presets to that size.\n\n221\n00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:53.820\n>> Correct.\n\n222\n00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:54.400\n>> Beautiful.\n\n223\n00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.710\n>> Correct.\n\n224\n00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.329\nAll right, so now we're going\nto talk about importing and\n\n225\n00:09:58.329 --> 00:09:59.515\nexporting in Photoshop.\n\n226\n00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:01.654\nBecause there's lots of\ndifferent options here.\n\n227\n00:10:01.654 --> 00:10:03.221\nPhotoshop can read a lot of files.\n\n228\n00:10:03.221 --> 00:10:04.373\nIt's pretty unbelievable.\n\n229\n00:10:04.373 --> 00:10:06.120\nIt's a great program.\n\n230\n00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.720\nSo let's go ahead and\ngo to file Export first.\n\n231\n00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.930\nSo Export is if you want to send your\nPhotoshop document out to something else.\n\n232\n00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.700\nSo you'll notice that you\nhave a quick Export as png.\n\n233\n00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.570\nA png is a very, very common file type,\n\n234\n00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.140\nwe're gonna talk about\nthat in a few minutes.\n\n235\n00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.820\nBut a lot of times when\nyou're working with an image,\n\n236\n00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.940\nyou are going to want\nto export it as a png.\n\n237\n00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.550\nSo this is just a quick way to do it.\n\n238\n00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.010\nQuick, simple click of a button.\n\n239\n00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.810\nYou can also export your artboards,\nif you're using artboards in Photoshop,\n\n240\n00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.080\nyour layers,\nall sorts of different things.\n\n241\n00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.830\nThey're there for\nyou under the Export menu.\n\n242\n00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:44.550\nUnder Import, this is where you can find\nmore specified files that might not be\n\n243\n00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.480\navailable under Open necessarily.\n\n244\n00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.380\nSo maybe if you're doing\nsome kind of video work,\n\n245\n00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.160\nyou can actually edit videos in Photoshop.\n\n246\n00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:51.770\nDid you know that?\n\n247\n00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:52.430\n>> Really?\nI did not.\n\n248\n00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:53.535\nThat's impressive.\n\n249\n00:10:53.535 --> 00:10:54.930\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, you certainly can.\n\n250\n00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:58.630\nYou can actually import your video\nframes as layers in Photoshop.\n\n251\n00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.750\n>> Wow.\nThat's neat.\n\n252\n00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.680\n>> That's under your Import option.\n\n253\n00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.860\nSo now I'm going to show you how\nto Save as the profile types.\n\n254\n00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.190\nSo now that we have this\ncrazy Colorado document.\n\n255\n00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:10.700\nI'm going to go to Save as.\n\n256\n00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:13.430\nAnd I've already named it.\n\n257\n00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:14.820\nWe named it Practice in the beginning.\n\n258\n00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.610\nIf you haven't named it yet,\nyou're gonna wanna name it now.\n\n259\n00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.660\nSo I'm going to save it right in this\nfolder where I can find that later.\n\n260\n00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.210\nIf you go down to this Format menu,\n\n261\n00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:28.390\nyou'll see all the different ways\nthat you can save your document.\n\n262\n00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:33.230\nI highly recommend that you save\neverything you do in Photoshop as a PSD,\n\n263\n00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.130\ncuz your PSD is your Photoshop document.\n\n264\n00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.910\n>> Okay, so that's the native\nfile format for Photoshop?\n\n265\n00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.040\n>> Correct, that's what saves your layers.\n\n266\n00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.675\nSo lets say you had this great image\nof Colorado, it's good to go, but\n\n267\n00:11:44.675 --> 00:11:47.550\nthen you realize you know I really\nwant to change the color of that.\n\n268\n00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.020\nI want to change the front.\n\n269\n00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.560\nHaving the PSD file will allow\nyou to make those edits.\n\n270\n00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.949\n>> Mm, very good.\n\n271\n00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:54.020\n>> Okay.\n\n272\n00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.860\nSo Photoshop's very common,\nthen you also have JPG.\n\n273\n00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.570\nSo if you click JPG, you'll notice that\nPhotoshop automatically selects As a Copy.\n\n274\n00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:06.050\nSo As a Copy is great because that way\nyou're not damaging your original file.\n\n275\n00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:06.730\n[LAUGH]\n>> You still have\n\n276\n00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.240\nthe PSD that you can go back to.\n\n277\n00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.560\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n278\n00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:14.470\nSo JPG's under there, and\nthen Photoshop PDF is another very common\n\n279\n00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:15.770\nkind of document that\nyou might want to save.\n\n280\n00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:21.610\nCuz PDFs can be read by a whole bunch of\ndifferent files format reading softwares.\n\n281\n00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:27.120\nAnd that's pretty much it for saving,\nso we're gonna go to Save in the corner.\n\n282\n00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.380\nOr, if you had several images,\nwe would go to the new folder and\n\n283\n00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.540\nyou can actually create\na new folder right there.\n\n284\n00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.970\n>> That's convenient.\n>> Mm-hm, so\n\n285\n00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.380\nI'm gonna go ahead and save this one.\n\n286\n00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.505\nLet me go back to\nPhotoshop document Save and\n\n287\n00:12:38.505 --> 00:12:42.820\nyou'll notice a pop-up box comes up,\nand it says maximize compatibility.\n\n288\n00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.960\nYou can go ahead and click Okay, and\nyou can check to Don't Show Again.\n\n289\n00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.850\nIt'll pop up every time.\n\n290\n00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:47.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then,\n\n291\n00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.750\nI don't know if you notice it was so\nquick,\n\n292\n00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.810\nbecause the file size is really small, but\nin the bottom left corner when we saved,\n\n293\n00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.580\nthere's a blue progress bar that\nshows you how quickly it's saving.\n\n294\n00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.000\n>> Gotcha.\n\n295\n00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.520\nThose are always great, cuz you\nwonder if the program, is it stuck,\n\n296\n00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.440\nis it doing anything?\n\n297\n00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.450\nNow I've got that progress bar down\nthere that I can watch and say, okay,\n\n298\n00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:07.305\nit's in the middle of saving.\n\n299\n00:13:07.305 --> 00:13:10.090\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n300\n00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.980\nSo now we're going to go out\nof Photoshop for a minute and\n\n301\n00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.910\nI'm going to go over some of the file\ntypes a little bit more in depth, and\n\n302\n00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.550\nyou'll be provided with\nthis document as well.\n\n303\n00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.250\nSo don't feel like you\nhave to jot it all down.\n\n304\n00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.310\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n305\n00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:21.390\n>> Let's exit out of that.\n\n306\n00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:26.011\nAnd let's go to our file types.\n\n307\n00:13:26.011 --> 00:13:26.608\nOkay.\n\n308\n00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:33.928\nAll right, so, these documents\nthat are highlighted in green,\n\n309\n00:13:33.928 --> 00:13:38.280\nthese are your most commonly\nused documents in Photoshop.\n\n310\n00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.540\nSo, I already told you what a PSD is.\n\n311\n00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.310\nSo, your PSD is your Photoshop document.\n\n312\n00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:42.690\nIt's that native file format.\n\n313\n00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.900\nIt's what allows you to save your layers.\n\n314\n00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.500\nThen you have something called a JIF or\n\n315\n00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.285\na GIF,\ndepending on how you wanna pronounce it.\n\n316\n00:13:49.285 --> 00:13:51.020\n[LAUGH]\n>> There's not really a correct\n\n317\n00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:51.700\nway, is it?\n\n318\n00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.098\nBecause everybody I talk to says,\nJIF, GIF, whichever you wanna use.\n\n319\n00:13:55.098 --> 00:13:56.350\n>> Correct, correct.\n\n320\n00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.895\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH]\n>> Didn't mean to put you on the spot\n\n321\n00:13:58.895 --> 00:14:01.690\nthere, but there is no right\npronunciation, I don't think.\n\n322\n00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:02.265\n[LAUGH]\n>> No.\n\n323\n00:14:02.265 --> 00:14:06.098\nAlthough I believe the creator did\ncome out not that long ago, and\n\n324\n00:14:06.098 --> 00:14:09.385\nhe said that it is a jif,\nnot gif, like everybody says.\n\n325\n00:14:09.385 --> 00:14:11.364\nBut, you know, creatures have it.\n\n326\n00:14:11.364 --> 00:14:12.665\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n327\n00:14:12.665 --> 00:14:17.735\n>> So, a GIF is excellent because you\ncan animate something with a GIF.\n\n328\n00:14:17.735 --> 00:14:22.350\nSo, let's pretend that you wanted to do\nsome kind of animation in Photoshop where\n\n329\n00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:25.130\nyou drew a dot, another dot,\na little smiley face.\n\n330\n00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:29.140\nSo you wanted to show the animation\nof creating that smile.\n\n331\n00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.150\nYou could do that in Photoshop,\nand save it as a GIF.\n\n332\n00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.670\n>> Nice.\n\n333\n00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.600\n>> Then you can upload it online and\n\n334\n00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.450\nthen it'll play through in a loop,\nif you set it to loop.\n\n335\n00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:38.790\n>> Okay.\n\n336\n00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:39.961\nSee a lot of those out there.\n\n337\n00:14:39.961 --> 00:14:42.330\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes, especially memes.\n\n338\n00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.700\nMemes are very popular right now.\n\n339\n00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.531\nSo if you wanted to make a meme,\nyou could do it with a GIF.\n\n340\n00:14:47.531 --> 00:14:51.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Our next green file format is an EPS.\n\n341\n00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.440\nSo that's\nan Encapsulated Post-Script Graphic.\n\n342\n00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.570\nThis is a file type that's used\nvery often in Illustrator.\n\n343\n00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.840\nSo if you're doing some kind of back and\nforth work,\n\n344\n00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.270\nyou might be working with EPS files, but\nthey are very large so keep that in mind.\n\n345\n00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:07.540\nYou're probably not going to be doing\nmuch with it other than sending it\n\n346\n00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.910\nto the printer, okay?\n\n347\n00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.380\nThen in our bottom right corner,\nwe have a JPG or\n\n348\n00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.000\nGPG, that is your most\ncommon image file type.\n\n349\n00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.480\nSo chances are, when you take a photo on\nyour camera, you are saving them as JPEGs.\n\n350\n00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.250\nI'm sure you have tons of\nthem on your computer.\n\n351\n00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:26.310\nThey're very flexible,\nthey tend to be small, and\n\n352\n00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.070\nthey can support a lot of colors.\n\n353\n00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:28.900\nThey're very popular.\n\n354\n00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.490\nLet's move on to the next page.\n\n355\n00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:37.330\nSo our Photoshop PDF again, like I said,\nthat's great because if you send a PDF to\n\n356\n00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.540\nsomebody like a client, they're gonna\nbe able to open it and look at it.\n\n357\n00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.065\nThey won't have to have\na Photoshop to open a PDF.\n\n358\n00:15:44.065 --> 00:15:45.870\n>> Yeah,\nPDF's are like that neutral on that.\n\n359\n00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.860\nJust about anybody can get a free\nreader to open up, so very handy.\n\n360\n00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.410\n>> Very handy.\n\n361\n00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.680\nThen you have a Photoshop Bro.\n\n362\n00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.070\nSo Photoshop Bro's what\nyou might want to use,\n\n363\n00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.840\nif you're doing a lot of photo\nediting with Camera Raw settings.\n\n364\n00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:02.620\nSo if you are a photographer, this would\nbe a file format that you might use.\n\n365\n00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.500\nThen at the bottom, we have a PNG.\n\n366\n00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.890\nSo a PNG is very similar to a JPEG, cause\nthey're smaller files, but they support\n\n367\n00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:13.590\ntransparency, which means you don't have\nto have a background for your image.\n\n368\n00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:14.090\n>> Nice.\n\n369\n00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.870\nThen we're gonna go on to our last page.\n\n370\n00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.700\nSo at the very bottom left corner,\nyou'll see a TIFF.\n\n371\n00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.150\nA TIFF is the type of file format\nyou would use for printing so\n\n372\n00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.170\nif you have an image that you\nwant to go in a magazine,\n\n373\n00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.920\na TIFF is a great option for\nyou because it's very high quality file.\n\n374\n00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:36.340\nAnd then over to the right, these video\nfile formats that are in the blue circles,\n\n375\n00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.950\nthese are the different types of file\nformats that you can do in Photoshop.\n\n376\n00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.390\nSo like I said, you can edit videos in\nhere, you can actually create videos.\n\n377\n00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.960\nThese are the supportive file formats.\n\n378\n00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.020\n>> That is amazing.\n\n379\n00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:51.220\nI just never would have thought of\nusing Photoshop to edit a video.\n\n380\n00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.710\n>> I know, it's something that\nnot everybody knows you can do,\n\n381\n00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:54.240\nbut you can do it.\n\n382\n00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:54.930\nAll right.\n\n383\n00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.390\nSo any questions about anything\nthat we've gone over today?\n\n384\n00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.200\n>> No.\nI think you did a very good job of\n\n385\n00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.050\nexplaining everything.\n\n386\n00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.680\nAnd I learned a lot about\nhow to open the files.\n\n387\n00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.140\nWe get them on our computer,\nhow do I get them into Photoshop?\n\n388\n00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.420\nAnd then, naming them, saving them.\n\n389\n00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.340\nAnd the different file\nformats we can save them in.\n\n390\n00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.050\nImporting and exporting.\n\n391\n00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:14.990\nLots of great stuff.\n\n392\n00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:16.690\nAnything else you wanna throw\nin this episode for us?\n\n393\n00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.250\n>> I don't think so.\n\n394\n00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:21.010\nI think we're all set, so\nstay tuned for our next episode.\n\n395\n00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:22.700\n>> All right, well we thank

00:00:16.880\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.468\nToday, we're doing\nAdobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:20.468 --> 00:00:23.147\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nit's time for\n\n6\n00:00:23.147 --> 00:00:25.990\nanother one of those try it out exercises.\n\n7\n00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.820\nHere to help us with that is Ms.\nKara Page.\n\n8\n00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.970\nHow's it going Kara?\n\n9\n00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:29.710\n>> I'm great.\n\n10\n00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.390\nAre you ready to try out\nwhat we just learned?\n\n11\n00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.232\n>> I am ready.\n\n12\n00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:37.020\n>> All right, so go ahead and\nget your Photoshop up and running, and\n\n13\n00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.460\nwe are going to try opening a file.\n\n14\n00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.252\nSo, you're gonna either\nclick on open here, or\n\n15\n00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:47.000\nyou're gonna go to File,\nOpen, whichever you prefer.\n\n16\n00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.590\nI'm gonna go to Open, and\nI'm going to find my file.\n\n17\n00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.010\nSo the one that we're going to be\nusing is called straighten, okay?\n\n18\n00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.070\nIt's a JPG and\nwe're going to be editing it, cropping it,\n\n19\n00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.230\ndoing different things to it.\n\n20\n00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.700\nSo let's go ahead and click Open on it.\n\n21\n00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.630\nSo there we go.\n\n22\n00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.410\nWe have this picture of a schoolhouse\nin Saint Martin in the Caribbean.\n\n23\n00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.820\nWe need to edit it because I don't\nlike all this concrete at the bottom.\n\n24\n00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.400\nI don't like how tilted it is.\n\n25\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.590\nYou'll notice that this\nis not a straight image.\n\n26\n00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.050\nI took this picture while\nrunning in a scavenger hunt.\n\n27\n00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.710\nSo it's amazing that it's even clear.\n\n28\n00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.110\nSo we need to straighten it out so\n\n29\n00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.660\nthat way we can actually\nuse it in our photo album.\n\n30\n00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.260\nSo, let's first practice\nwith the crop tool.\n\n31\n00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.370\nSo the crop tool is over here on the left.\n\n32\n00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.030\nIt's these two intersecting corners, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.840\nYou can also access it by clicking on C.\n\n34\n00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.948\nSo here we have our crop tool.\n\n35\n00:01:37.948 --> 00:01:40.765\nNow, if I If I drag up from the bottom,\n\n36\n00:01:42.155 --> 00:01:45.345\nyou'll notice that my height\nis changing as I do that.\n\n37\n00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:49.565\nAnd you'll also notice that it's hard\nto see the bottom of the document.\n\n38\n00:01:49.565 --> 00:01:53.695\nThe reason why is it's getting ready\nto cut that part out just as if we were\n\n39\n00:01:53.695 --> 00:01:55.770\nto use scissors, okay?\n\n40\n00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.720\nIf you didn't want to just crop and\n\n41\n00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.550\ndrag like this, there are other\noptions here where it says ratio.\n\n42\n00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.620\nSo, let's go ahead and\nhit enter to at least commit this crop.\n\n43\n00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.590\nSo let's Enter, there we go.\n\n44\n00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.740\nNow that we have a much smaller file but\n\n45\n00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.700\nwe don't have all that ugly\nconcrete at the bottom.\n\n46\n00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.440\nSo, if we go up here, let's click on\nour document again to access the crop.\n\n47\n00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.200\nYou'll notice that we have\ndifferent options here.\n\n48\n00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.150\nWe have width, height resolution,\nsquare, original ratios,\n\n49\n00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.090\nall sorts of different\noptions are here for you.\n\n50\n00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.190\nSo, if you're asked to do something\nspecific with cropping on the exam,\n\n51\n00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.730\ndon't forget to come up here and let's say\nit gives you width height resolution, if\n\n52\n00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.550\nyou were to click on that it'll give you\nyour width, height, and resolution, okay.\n\n53\n00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.600\nSo I'm not going to do that and I'm just\ngoing to play with what we have here.\n\n54\n00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.650\nSo I'm going to go back to\nmy just original old ratio.\n\n55\n00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.600\nAnd now we need to\nstraighten this picture.\n\n56\n00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.310\nYou can actually straighten\nit with the crop tool.\n\n57\n00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.710\nSo you'll notice here.\n\n58\n00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.690\nLet me just zoom in a little bit so\nyou can actually read it.\n\n59\n00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.550\nYou'll notice that we have a word up here,\nit says, straighten.\n\n60\n00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.750\nI'm going to click on this.\n\n61\n00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.640\nAnd I'm gonna zoom out so\nyou can actually see the whole thing.\n\n62\n00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.280\nThen click this straighten button.\n\n63\n00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.010\nAnd what I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to click and hold across.\n\n64\n00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.160\nSo what I'm doing is I'm drawing\na line across this porch for\n\n65\n00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.060\nwhat I think would be straight.\n\n66\n00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.510\nSo, when you let go, Photoshop's going\nto automatically straighten it for\n\n67\n00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.730\nyou based on where you drew your line.\n\n68\n00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.620\nSo I'm gonna hit Enter.\n\n69\n00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.960\nSo now we have a much better\nversion of this picture.\n\n70\n00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.280\nSo, to show you how much different it\nlooks, let's Save this particular file.\n\n71\n00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.117\nSo, I'm gonna to go up to file and\nsave as, and\n\n72\n00:03:41.117 --> 00:03:45.968\nI'm going to name this straighten 2, okay.\n\n73\n00:03:45.968 --> 00:03:48.770\nSaving it in the same folder so\nit's easier to find.\n\n74\n00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.250\nThe quality of 12, that's completely fine.\n\n75\n00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.060\nAnd then click okay.\n\n76\n00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.680\nNow, let's compare the two.\n\n77\n00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.050\nSo, let's go to file, and\n\n78\n00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.190\nopen, and find, straighten.\n\n79\n00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.140\nOkay, so you can either click and\nforth to see the difference or\n\n80\n00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.528\nyou can come up to window, arrange, let's\n\n81\n00:04:12.528 --> 00:04:17.305\ndo maybe 2-up Vertical.\n\n82\n00:04:17.305 --> 00:04:18.665\n>> Wow, big difference there.\n\n83\n00:04:18.665 --> 00:04:19.955\n>> Big difference, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:19.955 --> 00:04:24.755\nSo the way that I did that, again,\nwe learned about this very briefly,\n\n85\n00:04:24.755 --> 00:04:27.483\nbut I went to Window and Arrange, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:27.483 --> 00:04:31.004\n>> That Straighten tool, you could have\npicked any edge on that picture that's\n\n87\n00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:34.010\nstraight, like something\nthat's over on the horizon.\n\n88\n00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.302\nOr the edge of a building, you're just\ntelling Photoshop what it is that should\n\n89\n00:04:38.302 --> 00:04:41.388\nbe straight and\nits adjusting the picture accordingly.\n\n90\n00:04:41.388 --> 00:04:44.770\n>> Exactly, so\nyou give Photoshop this base line.\n\n91\n00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.960\nAnd then from there it will\ndo the straightening for you.\n\n92\n00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.750\n>> NIce.\n\n93\n00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.749\n>> Okay, so, I'm gonna come\nback up to Window, Arrange and\n\n94\n00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:55.520\nI'm going to consolidate all the tabs\ncuz that's just my preference.\n\n95\n00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.370\nI don't like seeing them\nside by side by side.\n\n96\n00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.048\nI think that's confusing.\n\n97\n00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:01.930\nSo I'm gonna x out of this regular,\nstraighten old JPG, so\n\n98\n00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.810\nthat's our original, here's our new.\n\n99\n00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.200\nSo now,\nlet's put this file into another document.\n\n100\n00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.030\nSo, lets come up to file, and\nwe're going to select new, and\n\n101\n00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.692\nlets do actually a six by four.\n\n102\n00:05:15.692 --> 00:05:18.490\nWe're gonna pretend that\nwe're going to do a postcard.\n\n103\n00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.980\nSo we have a width of six,\n\n104\n00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.050\na height of four, I'm gonna do mine in\ninches because I'm intending to print.\n\n105\n00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.250\nThen I'll also do a resolution\nof 300 cuz it is, print and\n\n106\n00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.980\nCMYK because again, it's print.\n\n107\n00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:37.400\nNow I do want a background on this, so I'm\ngoing to select a background color, okay?\n\n108\n00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.970\nNow my background color is white\nbecause that's what it is.\n\n109\n00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.410\nIf you look over here, the bottom left,\nthe background color is white,\n\n110\n00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.645\nif I had a different background\ncolor it will show up as that.\n\n111\n00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:47.980\nSo I'm gonna click OK.\n\n112\n00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.371\nNow we have our blank postcard.\n\n113\n00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:55.350\nNow, we need to get our\nstraighten 2 into our postcard.\n\n114\n00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.120\nThere are several ways to do it.\n\n115\n00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.770\nYou can click on this and\ndrag it into it, or\n\n116\n00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.310\nyou can go to file and\nplace which is what we are going to do.\n\n117\n00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.627\nSo let's go to file and place embedded.\n\n118\n00:06:06.627 --> 00:06:09.906\nAnd let's find straighten 2 and place.\n\n119\n00:06:11.398 --> 00:06:13.800\nOkay, so now we need transform it a bit.\n\n120\n00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.640\nit's a little bit large for our\ndocument cuz we need to add text to it.\n\n121\n00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.465\nSo I'm going to hold down\nshift as I drag a corner.\n\n122\n00:06:20.465 --> 00:06:24.080\nRemember that constraints\nyour proportions.\n\n123\n00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.390\nAnd right where I want it,\nI'm going to hit enter.\n\n124\n00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.940\nNow, with your move tool selected, you'll\nknow it's selected cuz you have that\n\n125\n00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.090\nlittle arrow with the four arrows, you\ncan move it to where you want it to be.\n\n126\n00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.560\nI want to rotate mine.\n\n127\n00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.070\nSo you can either hover\noutside of a corner, or\n\n128\n00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.440\nyou can go to edit, transform, and rotate.\n\n129\n00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.570\nSo let's kinda just drag\nthis guy here a little bit.\n\n130\n00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.790\nI just want it to be a little off-center.\n\n131\n00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.070\nLet's actually stretch him out so\n\n132\n00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.940\nhe doesn't fit exactly on the page,\nadd some interest here.\n\n133\n00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.020\nSo it looks like we just\nthrew a photo on here.\n\n134\n00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.850\nSo there we go.\n\n135\n00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.170\nNow if we wanted to add text to\nthis we could with our Type tool.\n\n136\n00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:07.094\nSo I'm just gonna select Type and\nI'm just going to write greetings.\n\n137\n00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:11.190\nOkay.\n\n138\n00:07:13.258 --> 00:07:15.490\nAnd I'll just move this down.\n\n139\n00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.360\nHere, so you can actually read it.\n\n140\n00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.818\nSo there we go, a very,\nvery basic postcard.\n\n141\n00:07:22.818 --> 00:07:26.090\nNow, if you wanted to save this postcard,\nI'm going to save\n\n142\n00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.680\nit as a Photoshop document,\nthat way I can go back and edit it.\n\n143\n00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.320\nSo it I wanted to change my text color,\n\n144\n00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.690\nI want to change where this\npicture was located, I could.\n\n145\n00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.390\nSo let's go to file, save as, and\n\n146\n00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.336\nwe can name it postcard.psd.\n\n147\n00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:43.840\nSave, okay.\n\n148\n00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.300\nNow our name is changed up at the top.\n\n149\n00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.680\nNow let's say that we want to save\nanother file cuz you wanna save it and\n\n150\n00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.963\nsend it to a friend or family via email.\n\n151\n00:07:52.963 --> 00:07:57.060\nYou could do it as a PNG, you could\ndo it as a JPG so, let's do that.\n\n152\n00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:03.260\nLet's go to file, save as and\nthen let's select JPG.\n\n153\n00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.670\nYou'll notice again it says as a copy and\nhit save.\n\n154\n00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.180\nYour quality 12 is good.\n\n155\n00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.230\nIt's a larger file but\nyour quality is higher.\n\n156\n00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.790\nSo, let's go ahead and click OK.\n\n157\n00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.640\nAnd now, we have a JPG saved as well.\n\n158\n00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.048\nSo if you wanted to email\nout your postcard you could.\n\n159\n00:08:20.048 --> 00:08:24.010\nAnd now you just try a few of\nskills that we just talked about.\n\n160\n00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:28.710\nSo hopefully you feel good about opening\nand placing and all that good stuff.\n\n161\n00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:29.650\n>> Fantastic, Kara.\n\n162\n00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:30.370\nWe thank you for that.\n\n163\n00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.010\nHad a lot of fun in that\ntry-it-out exercise.\n\n164\n00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.570\nHope you guys did too.\n\n165\n00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.480\nSigning off for ITPROTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n166\n00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.110\n>> And I'm Kara Page.\n\n167\n00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.338\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n168\n00:08:40.338 --> 00:08:48.389\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.024\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:20.650\nAnd today, we're going to be\ndoing Adobe Photoshop CC.\n\n5\n00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.900\nAnd in particular in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.580\nwe're gonna be looking at how we can\ntransform our images or our documents.\n\n7\n00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.970\nWe've learned in a previous episode\nhow to create a new document.\n\n8\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.838\nHow to open up an existing document.\n\n9\n00:00:31.838 --> 00:00:34.888\nNow we're gonna start getting in there and\nplaying around and\n\n10\n00:00:34.888 --> 00:00:37.010\ndoing transformations to that document.\n\n11\n00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.990\nHere to show us the way is Ms. Kara Page.\n\n12\n00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.970\nHow's it going, Kara?\n\n13\n00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:40.890\n>> I'm great, how are you?\n\n14\n00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.409\n>> Good, thanks.\n\n15\n00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.830\nAll right, so\nare you ready to get started?\n\n16\n00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.760\n>> I am.\n\n17\n00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.250\n>> Okay, so you learned last episode\nthat we know how to create a file now,\n\n18\n00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.128\nso we're going to do that again.\n\n19\n00:00:51.128 --> 00:00:54.090\nSo we're gonna go to File > New or\njust hit New if you have CC.\n\n20\n00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.530\nSo let's go ahead and click New.\n\n21\n00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.520\nAnd I'm just going to keep it at,\nlet's see,\n\n22\n00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.210\nI'm going to do, let's do Web this time.\n\n23\n00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.470\nAnd I'll just do this Web Most Common,\njust to try a different file format.\n\n24\n00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.455\n>> A little change of pace, always good.\n\n25\n00:01:09.455 --> 00:01:10.680\n>> Yeah, a change of pace.\n\n26\n00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.650\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nclick OK for this.\n\n27\n00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.120\nAnd there we have our document.\n\n28\n00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.610\nSo now I'm going to place\nsomething into my document.\n\n29\n00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.580\nSo I'm going to go to File.\n\n30\n00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.270\nAnd I'm going to go to Place Embedded.\n\n31\n00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.310\nAnd I'm going to look for\nthis file called Banana.\n\n32\n00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.620\nSo we're gonna be practicing with fruit.\n\n33\n00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.720\n[LAUGH] All right, so I'm gonna go\nahead and hit Place on this item.\n\n34\n00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.580\nSo, as I mentioned before this is\na bounding box that's around this banana.\n\n35\n00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.870\nSo, what we need to do with it is\neither commit to it, so place it, or\n\n36\n00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.780\nwe can also scale it, rotate it,\nwe can do all sorts of different things.\n\n37\n00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.520\nSo, I'm gonna show you what would happen\nif we just went ahead and committed, so\n\n38\n00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.781\nI'm gonna hit Enter or\nyou can hit the check box.\n\n39\n00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:55.630\nNow our bounding box is gone.\n\n40\n00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.010\nSo we just have this banana,\nit's really doing nothing,\n\n41\n00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.570\nit's just hanging out in space.\n\n42\n00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.010\nSo what we need to do is we need to\nshow our transform control so that way,\n\n43\n00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.090\nwe can actually do something with it.\n\n44\n00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.770\nSo you can hit this show transform\ncontrols button at the top or\n\n45\n00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.610\nyou can hit Cmd+T or Ctrl+T.\n\n46\n00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.060\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick on that and\n\n47\n00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.030\nyou'll see my bounding box has reappeared.\n\n48\n00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.530\n>> Nice.\n\n49\n00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.150\n>> So what I'm gonna do first is\nshow you how to resize this banana.\n\n50\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.020\nSo we want this banana to be\na little bit bigger than it is.\n\n51\n00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.110\nNow if you were to just drag\na corner of it, you'll notice that\n\n52\n00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.900\nit becomes a little bit distorted,\nwhich is not exactly what we want.\n\n53\n00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.730\nSo, I'm just gonna hit Enter and\nI'm gonna undo what I just did.\n\n54\n00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.639\nSo, what we're gonna do this time is we're\ngoing to hold down on Shift as we click\n\n55\n00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.240\nand hold out this corner.\n\n56\n00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.910\nOkay?\nSo, ready and let's just.\n\n57\n00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.770\nOkay, there we go.\n\n58\n00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.830\nAnd it keeps the proportions for us.\n\n59\n00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.350\n>> So it constrains it.\n\n60\n00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.840\nIt excises the X and Y proportionally.\n\n61\n00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.960\n>> Yes.\nSo again, make sure to hold down Shift.\n\n62\n00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.910\nBecause if you don't,\nyou might distort your best friend or\n\n63\n00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.030\nyour cousin or\nwhoever you're working with.\n\n64\n00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.740\nSo don't do that,\nit looks really silly on people.\n\n65\n00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.640\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nhit Enter to commit my change.\n\n66\n00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.290\nSo now I want to rotate it.\n\n67\n00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.720\nSo there are several ways you can do this.\n\n68\n00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.450\nYou can hover beyond the corner, and\nyou'll notice the little rotation arrows.\n\n69\n00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.870\nYou've probably seen them before,\nthey happen in Word and other programs.\n\n70\n00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.500\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\njust rotate this a little bit.\n\n71\n00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.400\nAnd you'll notice that we\nhave an angle that appears.\n\n72\n00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.684\nSo off to the side,\nmine says negative 34.3 right now.\n\n73\n00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:40.340\nThat's showing your degree of rotation.\n\n74\n00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.440\nNow if you come up to the very top, you'll\nbe able to see that number here as well.\n\n75\n00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.780\nAnd you can input your own number.\n\n76\n00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.380\nSo let's say that we wanted to do 90.\n\n77\n00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.880\nThere you go.\n\n78\n00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.920\nYou can go ahead and set your rotation.\n\n79\n00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.560\n>> So you can be very specific\nwith that rotation if you need to.\n\n80\n00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.103\n>> Exactly, so I'm gonna go ahead and\ncommit that, so\n\n81\n00:03:57.103 --> 00:04:00.743\nnow we have this crazy\nup-side-down banana [LAUGH].\n\n82\n00:04:00.743 --> 00:04:01.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n83\n00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.850\nnow we're gonna go into this Transform\nmenu, so we have a lot of options\n\n84\n00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.940\nunder this Transform menu, so\nwe're gonna go to Edit up at the top.\n\n85\n00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.480\nAnd we're going to click on Transform.\n\n86\n00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.641\nSo you'll see off to the side we have\na lot of different options under our\n\n87\n00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:17.070\nTransform menu.\n\n88\n00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.350\nSo scaling is what we did at first.\n\n89\n00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.330\nScaling is changing its size.\n\n90\n00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.374\nThen we just rotated it, but again,\nyou can get to them in this menu.\n\n91\n00:04:23.374 --> 00:04:27.520\nIt's very flexible in Photoshop\nhow you're going to do things.\n\n92\n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.120\nBut, next thing I'm gonna show\nyou is something called skew.\n\n93\n00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.988\nSo let's go ahead and select Skew.\n\n94\n00:04:30.988 --> 00:04:31.964\n>> Bless you.\n\n95\n00:04:31.964 --> 00:04:34.504\n>> [LAUGH] Very funny.\n\n96\n00:04:34.504 --> 00:04:40.670\n[LAUGH] So skewing, what happens is you'll\nnotice that our arrow has turned to white.\n\n97\n00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.650\nSo, it's turned to white and\nnow if I drag it.\n\n98\n00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.960\nWe're distorting its angle now,\nit's basically how it looks on the page.\n\n99\n00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.550\nSo if we were to have\nsomething like a sign.\n\n100\n00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.480\nLet's say that you took a picture of\nyour favorite street downtown and\n\n101\n00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.030\nyou wanted to put a banana on the sign for\nsome reason.\n\n102\n00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.460\nYou can skew the banana in a way\nto better fit on the sign.\n\n103\n00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.820\nOr we're gonna go over a few other\ndifferent transformation options,\n\n104\n00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.610\nthat will allow you to\ndo just that as well.\n\n105\n00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.890\n>> Almost like you can give it\na little bit of perspective.\n\n106\n00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.170\n>> Exactly, there actually is\nperspective on here, as well.\n\n107\n00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.930\n>> Okay.\n>> We're gonna go back to transform, and\n\n108\n00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.780\nthis time we're going to select, distort.\n\n109\n00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.610\nSo, distort is also our\nlittle white arrow.\n\n110\n00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.180\nAnd it works very similar\nto what we were just doing.\n\n111\n00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.780\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit Enter on that.\n\n112\n00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.580\nAnd now I'm gonna show you\nthe perspective like you just mentioned.\n\n113\n00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.650\nSo we're gonna go to Transform >\nPerspective and we can drag out exactly\n\n114\n00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.730\nhow it looks, so if we want our banana\nto look 3D you can do that in here.\n\n115\n00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.530\nSo we've really changed our banana now.\n\n116\n00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.340\nIt doesn't even look\nlike a banana anymore.\n\n117\n00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.278\n>> It doesn't, it looks like strange\npepper at this point I think.\n\n118\n00:05:50.278 --> 00:05:51.830\n>> I think so.\n\n119\n00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.610\nSo lets go back to Edit and\nTransform again and\n\n120\n00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.510\nthen beneath that you'll\nsee that we have Warp.\n\n121\n00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.760\nSo Warp is a really fun one.\n\n122\n00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.500\nWarp, a grid comes up and\nwe can select these little dots and\n\n123\n00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.705\nkind of pull them in in different ways.\n\n124\n00:06:05.705 --> 00:06:09.350\n>> Wow.\n\n125\n00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.562\n>> We twisted our banana.\n\n126\n00:06:10.562 --> 00:06:12.170\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit Enter on that.\n\n127\n00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.115\nSo now we this abstract\ntwisted banana pepper.\n\n128\n00:06:15.115 --> 00:06:16.866\n[LAUGH]\n>> That is beautiful.\n\n129\n00:06:16.866 --> 00:06:17.371\n[LAUGH]\n>> Thank you.\n\n130\n00:06:17.371 --> 00:06:22.940\n[LAUGH] Lets go back to Edit and\nsee what else we have with Transform.\n\n131\n00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.365\nSo right beneath all of those options\nyou'll see that we have an option\n\n132\n00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:28.130\nto rotate 180 degrees.\n\n133\n00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.409\nSo you can go ahead and\nclick that if you'd like.\n\n134\n00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:33.390\nAnd there we go,\nwe've rotated it 180 degrees.\n\n135\n00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.040\nNow as you noticed before,\n\n136\n00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.930\nwhen I did our rotation where I had\nour little arrows out to the side.\n\n137\n00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.830\nYou can also enter the 180 there as well.\n\n138\n00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:41.850\n>> Okay.\n\n139\n00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.480\n>> So lots of different options.\n\n140\n00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.920\nLet's go back here to Transform.\n\n141\n00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.840\nYou can do clockwise,\nyou can also do counterclockwise.\n\n142\n00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.007\nVery quick and easy.\n\n143\n00:06:51.007 --> 00:06:55.025\nLet's go back to Transform again and\nyou'll see we have Flip Horizontal and\n\n144\n00:06:55.025 --> 00:06:55.920\nFlip Vertical.\n\n145\n00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.670\nHave you ever flipped horizontal or\nvertical before?\n\n146\n00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.110\n>> A couple of times, yes.\n\n147\n00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.328\nBut I always get it confused,\n\n148\n00:07:01.328 --> 00:07:04.070\nwhich one is flipping horizontal\nwhich one is flipping vertical.\n\n149\n00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.410\nI typically have to do one and\ngo that's the one I want or no,\n\n150\n00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.380\nthat's not the one I want.\n\n151\n00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.150\nUndo and do the other one.\n\n152\n00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.320\n>> All right, so let's see what\nhappens when we do Flip Horizontal.\n\n153\n00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.190\n>> Okay.\n>> All right.\n\n154\n00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.250\nAnd there we go.\n\n155\n00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.350\n>> Nice.\n\n156\n00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.234\n>> So it went from left to\na reflection of itself on the right.\n\n157\n00:07:20.234 --> 00:07:24.060\nAnd let's see what happens if we\nwere to go ahead and Flip Vertical.\n\n158\n00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.730\nSo vertical is your up and down.\n\n159\n00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:28.350\n>> Okay.\n\n160\n00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.830\nHorizontal is yoor side to side.\n\n161\n00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.300\n>> I will remember that.\n\n162\n00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.927\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n163\n00:07:33.927 --> 00:07:38.740\nalso under Transform we have\nPuppet Warp and Perspective Warp.\n\n164\n00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.229\nNow these are more advanced tools if you\nlike to do more advanced transformations.\n\n165\n00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:47.080\nSo Puppet Warp is something that might\nbe used if you're a photographer and\n\n166\n00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.710\nyou have a picture of a model, and\nyou don't like how their arm looks.\n\n167\n00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.980\nSo maybe their arm is up in\nthe air in a strange way.\n\n168\n00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.260\nYou don't like it.\n\n169\n00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.100\nYou can actually set points and\n\n170\n00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.770\nshift the arm to make it look\nnatural with puppet warp.\n\n171\n00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:01.990\nThat's pretty unbelievable.\n\n172\n00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.164\n>> That is amazing, yeah.\n\n173\n00:08:03.164 --> 00:08:05.810\n>> Perspective Warp works\nin a similar way, so\n\n174\n00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.570\nlet's say that you had a picture of\nsomething like Times Square, and\n\n175\n00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.570\nyou wanted to put your own\nfake advertisement up there.\n\n176\n00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.120\nYou could,\n\n177\n00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.030\nusing Perspective Warp, to really make\nit look like it's part of the image.\n\n178\n00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.360\nSo that way it has more 3D\nkind of dimension going on.\n\n179\n00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:21.700\n>> That is pretty impressive.\n\n180\n00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.540\nAlthough it does make me think you can't\nbelieve what you see anymore [LAUGH].\n\n181\n00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.510\n>> That's exactly right\nwith Photoshop [LAUGH].\n\n182\n00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.910\nOkay, so\nnow I'm gonna show you how to zoom.\n\n183\n00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.970\nSo, zooming is something that you're gonna\nwant to know how to do in Photoshop,\n\n184\n00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.420\nbecause chances are, you're going to\nbe working on a very close level.\n\n185\n00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.970\nSo you might even be looking\nat pixels versus pixels.\n\n186\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.750\nSo I'm going to show you\ndifferent ways to zoom.\n\n187\n00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.700\nThe first one is to go\nto View up at the top.\n\n188\n00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:52.277\nSo under View you'll see Zoom In,\nZoom Out, Fit on Screen, 100%, 200%,\n\n189\n00:08:52.277 --> 00:08:52.991\nPrint Size.\n\n190\n00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:54.220\nThey're all there for you.\n\n191\n00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.210\nYou're welcome to click on that.\n\n192\n00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.270\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and click in.\n\n193\n00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.890\nAnd there, we zoomed in once.\n\n194\n00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.490\nThe other thing that you can do\nis go ahead and do Cmd++or Cmd+-.\n\n195\n00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.943\nI highly recommend doing\nyour shortcuts for\n\n196\n00:09:06.943 --> 00:09:10.680\nCtrl+- Ctrl++ depending on\nwhether you're on a PC or a Mac.\n\n197\n00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.490\nSo we're gonna go ahead and I'm just\ngoing to just click several times and\n\n198\n00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.620\nyou'll see that we are down\nat the pixel level now.\n\n199\n00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.910\nSo do you know what a pixel is?\n\n200\n00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.510\nHave you ever heard of a pixel?\n\n201\n00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.320\n>> I don't know the formal\ndefinition of one, no.\n\n202\n00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.720\n>> Okay,\nwell a pixel is just a tiny block of color\n\n203\n00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.030\nthat builds upon other blocks of\ncolors to create a big image, okay?\n\n204\n00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:34.710\n>> Okay.\n\n205\n00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.240\n>> So now we're really zoomed in.\n\n206\n00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.630\nI don't even know where I am in\nthis document right now, and\n\n207\n00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.640\nnow I need to figure out how to get back.\n\n208\n00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.080\nNow if I were to just click and drag,\nI'd actually be moving the banana,\n\n209\n00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.250\nwhich is not what I wanna do.\n\n210\n00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.220\nSo what we're going to do\nis we're going to learn\n\n211\n00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.000\nhow to do more of a panning type option.\n\n212\n00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.600\nSo over on the left you'll\nnotice we have a hand.\n\n213\n00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.440\nIt's kind of waving.\n\n214\n00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.380\nIt's saying hello.\n\n215\n00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:00.820\nYou can click on the hand tool and that\nallows you to adjust in your canvas so\n\n216\n00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.800\nI'm going to zoom out so\nyou can actually see this.\n\n217\n00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:10.040\nSo we're adjusting our canvas without\nactually moving our banana around.\n\n218\n00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.720\nThe other way to do that is to click\non the space bar, so the space bar will\n\n219\n00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.093\nbring up the hand and we're zooming\naround in our art board again.\n\n220\n00:10:19.093 --> 00:10:22.465\nNow it's very helpful if you have\na very complicated document and\n\n221\n00:10:22.465 --> 00:10:25.343\nyou're trying to get over to\na very specific part of it,\n\n222\n00:10:25.343 --> 00:10:28.008\nyou can use this hand or\nyour space bar to get there.\n\n223\n00:10:28.008 --> 00:10:29.759\n>> Very nice.\n\n224\n00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:33.580\n>> Okay, the other great thing about\npanning or using your space bar is\n\n225\n00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.810\nit will default back to your\noriginal tool that you were using.\n\n226\n00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.360\nSo let's say that you're trying\nto cut out a part of an image.\n\n227\n00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.830\nYou cut it out, but then you need to\nuse the hand tool real quick to move.\n\n228\n00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.972\nOnce you let go of the space bar,\nit'll still be on you other tool.\n\n229\n00:10:48.972 --> 00:10:49.980\n>> That's convenient.\n\n230\n00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:50.990\n>> Yes, very helpful.\n\n231\n00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.730\nOkay, so any questions about\nthe transformations part?\n\n232\n00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:59.340\nWe're going to talk a little bit more\nabout saving files, resizing files next.\n\n233\n00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.540\n>> No, it was very good.\n\n234\n00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.730\nIt is amazing what you can\ndo with the transform tool.\n\n235\n00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.070\nVery cool stuff.\n\n236\n00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.260\n>> Yeah, very cool.\n\n237\n00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.590\nAll right, so now what we're going\nto do is I'm gonna show you how to\n\n238\n00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.490\nresize an image in Photoshops.\n\n239\n00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:14.650\nWe learned how to open an image before,\nwe're gonna go and open one again.\n\n240\n00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.340\nSo let's go to File > Open,\n\n241\n00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.490\nyou can open any kind of image on\nyour computer that you'd like.\n\n242\n00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:25.620\nI'm going to go ahead and\nselect this lovely picture of my dog.\n\n243\n00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.372\nThis is Cinnamon.\n\n244\n00:11:26.372 --> 00:11:27.055\n>> Aw, hi Cinnamon.\n\n245\n00:11:27.055 --> 00:11:28.150\n>> I know, isn't she friendly?\n\n246\n00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.765\nWhat a friendly little dog she is.\n\n247\n00:11:29.765 --> 00:11:31.179\n[LAUGH]\n>> Nice little smile.\n\n248\n00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:32.570\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n249\n00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.620\nSo, I'm gonna show you\nhow to resize this file.\n\n250\n00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.510\nSo, first we need to know\nwhat size this file is.\n\n251\n00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.864\nSo let's go up to Image up at the top.\n\n252\n00:11:39.864 --> 00:11:42.240\nAnd under image we can look at Image Size.\n\n253\n00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:47.290\nSo if you click Image Size, you'll be able\nto see exactly how large this image is.\n\n254\n00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.710\nSo it's right now in pixels and if I\nwanted to change it from pixels, I could.\n\n255\n00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.820\nI could change it to inches, and you'll\nsee it's little bit bigger than an 8x8.\n\n256\n00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.980\nLet's say that I wanted it, a little\nbit smaller, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n257\n00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.020\nchange the width so\nsomething like five inches.\n\n258\n00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.770\nYou'll notice my height changed as well.\n\n259\n00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:09.000\nThe reason why is because of this\nlittle paper clip looking thing.\n\n260\n00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.250\nWhat this does is it makes sure that\nyour proportions stay the same.\n\n261\n00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.960\n>> Kinda like when we were holding\nShift using the Transform tool.\n\n262\n00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.730\n>> Exactly,\nwe don't want distorted images.\n\n263\n00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.180\nWe don't want Cinnamon to,\nall of a sudden, turn into a weiner dog.\n\n264\n00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:21.880\nShe's so small.\n\n265\n00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.120\nWe don't want that to happen.\n\n266\n00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, what we're gonna do is we're going\n\n267\n00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.060\nto go ahead and do that.\n\n268\n00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.360\nAnd then you'll notice that we\nhave something called Resample.\n\n269\n00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:33.670\nSo if you have Resample checked, it will\nmake sure that your pixels react properly.\n\n270\n00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.785\nSo let's go ahead and\nsee what happens when we click OK.\n\n271\n00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.240\nSo you'll notice that it\nlooks like we zoomed out.\n\n272\n00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.536\nWe didn't,\nIt's just that our file got smaller.\n\n273\n00:12:42.536 --> 00:12:44.134\nDoes that make sense?\n>> Very good, it does.\n\n274\n00:12:44.134 --> 00:12:47.690\nIs resampling something you should\ndo every time you change the size?\n\n275\n00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:52.000\n>> Yes, that way you don't\ndamage your proportions or\n\n276\n00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.320\ndamage the way the pixels look.\n\n277\n00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:53.930\n>> Okay.\n\n278\n00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:58.420\n>> Okay, so the other thing we're\ngonna learn how to do is cropping.\n\n279\n00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.970\nCropping is destructive.\n\n280\n00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.804\nSo what that means is\nonce you crop something,\n\n281\n00:13:02.804 --> 00:13:04.610\nyou are deleting those pixels forever.\n\n282\n00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.865\nSay goodbye to whatever part of\nthe picture, we're not gonna see it again.\n\n283\n00:13:07.865 --> 00:13:08.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n284\n00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.500\nwe're going to crop part of this image.\n\n285\n00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.050\nI'm gonna zoom it a little bit.\n\n286\n00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:13.870\n>> Crop carefully and responsibly.\n\n287\n00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.570\n>> Crop carefully and very responsibly.\n\n288\n00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:20.510\n[LAUGH] So I just zoomed in so that way we\ncould see Cinnamon a little bit better,\n\n289\n00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.450\nso I did my Cmd++ or your Ctrl++.\n\n290\n00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:25.721\nAnd there,\nnow we have her exactly where we want her.\n\n291\n00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:28.570\nNow I don't want that\nTV in the background.\n\n292\n00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.490\nThat's kinda ruining my\npicture of Cinnamon.\n\n293\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:32.230\nSo let's fix it a little bit.\n\n294\n00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.190\nWe're gonna go over to the Crop tool,\nwhich is over on the left.\n\n295\n00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.410\nIt looks like two intersecting boxes.\n\n296\n00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.310\nIt's also a shortcut C, so\nif you need it that way, there you go.\n\n297\n00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.950\nNow up in the top left, you'll see all\nthe different options for cropping.\n\n298\n00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.490\nSo you can do square,\nyou can do original ratio.\n\n299\n00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.204\nYou can do all sorts of different things\nthat you're going to need to find what\n\n300\n00:13:51.204 --> 00:13:52.928\nworks best for your image.\n\n301\n00:13:52.928 --> 00:13:56.830\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nleave it on my one to one square.\n\n302\n00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:01.197\nSo you'll notice that we have little\ndark lines around the edge of our photo.\n\n303\n00:14:01.197 --> 00:14:03.695\nWhat we're gonna do is,\nI'm gonna select one of those,\n\n304\n00:14:03.695 --> 00:14:07.320\nI'm gonna select this top one and\ndrag it down ever so slightly.\n\n305\n00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:13.250\nSince I have square selected,\nit's keeping my image as square, okay?\n\n306\n00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.010\nSo I have her exactly where I want her.\n\n307\n00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:18.176\nNow I have to confirm this crop.\n\n308\n00:14:18.176 --> 00:14:20.220\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and hit Enter, or\n\n309\n00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.530\nyou can hit the check\nto commit your change.\n\n310\n00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.810\nSo I'm going to hit Enter,\nand there we go.\n\n311\n00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.370\nNow we don't have the TV anymore.\n\n312\n00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:27.360\n>> Beautiful\n>> Yeah.\n\n313\n00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.700\n>> Now we can focus in on Cinnamon.\n\n314\n00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.456\n>> We can focus in on Cinnamon's\nlittle face and her little bows.\n\n315\n00:14:31.456 --> 00:14:32.110\n>> Very good.\n\n316\n00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:33.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n317\n00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:35.490\n>> Wow, that's a lot of great information.\n\n318\n00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:38.950\nA lot of things I can do with that\nimage when it comes to transforming.\n\n319\n00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:40.630\nI can do pretty much whatever I want.\n\n320\n00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.790\nResize it, flip it, rotate it,\ncrop it, fantastic.\n\n321\n00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.020\nAnything else we need to go over\nin this particular episode?\n\n322\n00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.790\n>> No, I think that's pretty much it.\n\n323\n00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:52.820\nSo now that you've learned how to open,\nhow to place, how to crop, go ahead and\n\n324\n00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.250\ntry some of your own photos.\n\n325\n00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.310\nMaybe you wanna try resizing\nyour favorite picture.\n\n326\n00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:59.010\nGo ahead and try it.\n\n327\n00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.010\n>> Very good, all right.\n\n328\n00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:01.430\nWell, thank you, Kara, for that one.\n\n329\n00:15:01.430 -->

--> 00:00:18.036\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:22.037\ntoday we're gonna be going\nover Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:22.037 --> 00:00:25.474\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna be taking a look at layers, and\n\n6\n00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:27.130\nhere to help us with that is Ms. Kara.\n\n7\n00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.500\nHow are you doing, Kara?\n\n8\n00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.150\n>> I'm great.\n\n9\n00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.600\nAre we ready to go ahead and\nget started with layers?\n\n10\n00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.870\n>> Absolutely.\n\n11\n00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.900\n>> Okay, so let's go ahead and\nget started.\n\n12\n00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.450\nI'm gonna show you\nactually with paper first,\n\n13\n00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.710\nbecause that makes a lot more sense\nthan jumping right into Photoshop.\n\n14\n00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.074\nSo we're gonna go very low tech for\nthis little exercise.\n\n15\n00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:41.991\n>> All right.\n\n16\n00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:43.203\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n17\n00:00:43.203 --> 00:00:45.760\nI'm going to start with three\nlittle sheets of paper.\n\n18\n00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.330\nSo let's go ahead and\nturn on the overhead cam for this.\n\n19\n00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.290\nOkay so now you can see my workspace.\n\n20\n00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.330\nLet's line it up just so.\n\n21\n00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.780\nOkay we have this lovely little rectangle.\n\n22\n00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.770\nOkay, so that's a layer, okay.?\n\n23\n00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.370\nPlay along with me this is a layer.\n\n24\n00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.308\nNow I'm going to stack\nsomething on top of it.\n\n25\n00:01:02.308 --> 00:01:08.540\nSo it's going to be this little\ngreen Post-It Note, okay?\n\n26\n00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.275\nSo these two are completely\nseparate things, but\n\n27\n00:01:11.275 --> 00:01:13.840\nthey're sitting on top of each other,\nso now we have two layers.\n\n28\n00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.900\n>> So they look like they're interacting,\nbut they're actually on separate layers so\n\n29\n00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.720\nthey're really not.\n\n30\n00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.950\n>> Exactly.\nAnd then we have a third.\n\n31\n00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.190\nSo here we have our third\nlittle swirly layer.\n\n32\n00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.890\nSo this layer is mostly\ncovering up the second,\n\n33\n00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.820\nwhich isn't ideal for what we want.\n\n34\n00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.250\nBut we could do several things\nin Photoshop to adjust this.\n\n35\n00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.420\nThe first thing we could do\nis rearrange our layer order.\n\n36\n00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.780\nSo let's move this red guy and\nlet's put him all the way to the bottom.\n\n37\n00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.010\nOk, so now he's the bottom layer.\n\n38\n00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.450\nNow we can decide, okay, I want the green\nto be over here slightly overlapping.\n\n39\n00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.488\nI want this rectangle to be over here.\n\n40\n00:01:48.488 --> 00:01:50.648\nThey're all separate from each other, so\n\n41\n00:01:50.648 --> 00:01:53.834\nyou can do whatever you want to\nthem without editing the other.\n\n42\n00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:55.877\nSo let's pretend that we had scissors,\nokay?\n\n43\n00:01:55.877 --> 00:01:59.440\nAnd you wanted to cut out a little\nshape on one of these shapes.\n\n44\n00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.610\nSo we're gonna make one into a snowflake.\n\n45\n00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.727\nYou could do that to, say,\n\n46\n00:02:02.727 --> 00:02:06.880\nthe green one without affecting any other\nlayer because it's completely separate.\n\n47\n00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.850\n>> Nice.\n\n48\n00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.920\nOkay.\n>> Okay?\n\n49\n00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.700\n>> I like that visual aid.\n\n50\n00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.306\nVery good.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n51\n00:02:10.306 --> 00:02:10.818\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n52\n00:02:10.818 --> 00:02:11.328\n>> All right,\n\n53\n00:02:11.328 --> 00:02:14.820\nso we're gonna be talking about something\ncalled merging layers, as well.\n\n54\n00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.630\nSo if you just think back to this whole\n\n55\n00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.660\npaper idea it will help you with things\nlike merging, flattening, grouping.\n\n56\n00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.850\nSo are we ready to go ahead and\nget started in Photoshop?\n\n57\n00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:25.870\n>> Absolutely.\n\n58\n00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.249\n>> Okay.\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n59\n00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:28.639\nget our screens ready here.\n\n60\n00:02:32.307 --> 00:02:35.366\nOkay, so what we're gonna do first\nis we're going to go ahead and\n\n61\n00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:36.640\nselect a new document.\n\n62\n00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.867\nSo hit New.\n\n63\n00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:42.810\nAnd I'm just gonna use a standard U.S.\npaper, eight and a half by eleven.\n\n64\n00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.490\nBecause it really doesn't matter for\nwhat we're doing so\n\n65\n00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.730\nwe're just gonna go ahead\nwith the default size.\n\n66\n00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.470\nSo hit OK.\n\n67\n00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.510\nNow the first thing that you'll\nnotice is we have a Layers panel.\n\n68\n00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.710\nThe Layers panel is down in your bottom\nright corner of the screen, right here.\n\n69\n00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.290\nOkay, you'll see the word Layers, and\n\n70\n00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.110\nthen it kind of looks like\ncollapsible folders right there.\n\n71\n00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.660\nSo you'll notice we actually have a layer\nhere, and it's called Background.\n\n72\n00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.840\nSo it'll say Background, and\nit'll have this little lock icon there.\n\n73\n00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.870\nNow it's locked, which means you\nwouldn't be able to edit it at all.\n\n74\n00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.800\nSo if I wanted to do something like erase\npart of this background I wouldn't be able\n\n75\n00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.450\nto because it's locked.\n\n76\n00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.430\nSo let's go ahead and\nunlock our background layer first.\n\n77\n00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.400\nSo the easiest way to do that is to\neither click on the lock icon, or\n\n78\n00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.360\nwhat you can do is\ndouble-click on your layer.\n\n79\n00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.320\nEither one works, okay?\n\n80\n00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.610\nSo you'll notice now\nthat it's called Layer 0.\n\n81\n00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.870\nI don't like to call my layers\njust Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3..\n\n82\n00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.585\nThat's not descriptive.\n\n83\n00:03:35.585 --> 00:03:36.607\nYou're gonna lose things.\n\n84\n00:03:36.607 --> 00:03:37.547\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n85\n00:03:37.547 --> 00:03:39.790\n[LAUGH]\n>> So let's rename this layer.\n\n86\n00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.600\nWhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\ndouble-click where it says Layer 0.\n\n87\n00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.202\nMake sure to select the word, though,\nand not the icon to the left.\n\n88\n00:03:47.202 --> 00:03:51.580\nSo double-click and I'm going to name\nthis Background, so I know what it is.\n\n89\n00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.720\nAnd I just hit Enter\nonce I was done typing.\n\n90\n00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.340\nOkay, so now we have a layer.\n\n91\n00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.120\nNow we want to add another layer.\n\n92\n00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.610\nSo what you're going to do is you're going\nto find the little icon in the bottom\n\n93\n00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.340\ncorner that looks like a sticky note\nwith a little corner turned up.\n\n94\n00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.870\nSo I'm going to click on that.\n\n95\n00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.100\nIf you hover over it,\nit also says Create New Layer.\n\n96\n00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.669\nSo now we have an empty Layer 1.\n\n97\n00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:19.064\nYou can tell it's empty because it has\na checkerboard pattern right here on\n\n98\n00:04:19.064 --> 00:04:20.140\nits icon.\n\n99\n00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.427\nThat means that there's nothing there,\nokay?\n\n100\n00:04:22.427 --> 00:04:23.461\nSo I'm gonna name this one.\n\n101\n00:04:23.461 --> 00:04:25.342\nI'm going to name this one Line.\n\n102\n00:04:25.342 --> 00:04:27.804\nSo I'm gonna double-click\non the word again.\n\n103\n00:04:27.804 --> 00:04:30.930\nAnd I'm just going to write Line,\nand hit Enter.\n\n104\n00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.212\nSo now we have our own\nlayer to mess around with.\n\n105\n00:04:33.212 --> 00:04:36.620\nNow I'm going to use the Brush\ntool to create a line.\n\n106\n00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.240\nNow we haven't gone over\nthe Brush tool in depth.\n\n107\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.280\nThat's completely fine.\n\n108\n00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.170\nJust go along with me because\nwe're not doing anything in depth.\n\n109\n00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.830\nThis is just to show you what\nlayers are like in Photoshop.\n\n110\n00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.230\nSo your Brush icon is all\nthe way over on the left and\n\n111\n00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.630\nit looks exactly like a paintbrush.\n\n112\n00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.740\nSo you're going to select that.\n\n113\n00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.270\nAnd I'm just going to select a pretty\nstandard brush up at the top.\n\n114\n00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.465\nYou can select any of these.\n\n115\n00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:01.140\nYou don't have to worry about\nwhat they mean right now.\n\n116\n00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.860\nIt really doesn't matter.\n\n117\n00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.040\nSo I'm gonna click off of that,\nand I'm going to select a color.\n\n118\n00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.610\nSo right now I'm defaulted to white.\n\n119\n00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.931\nIf I paint white on white [LAUGH]\nyou're not gonna see anything.\n\n120\n00:05:09.931 --> 00:05:13.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm going to just pick a red color.\n\n121\n00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.980\nIt'll be really bright and vibrant.\n\n122\n00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.610\nIt'll be easy for you to see.\n\n123\n00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.263\nSo I'm just going to do a little doodle.\n\n124\n00:05:20.912 --> 00:05:21.730\nOkay?\n\n125\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.490\n>> Nice.\n>> And there we have a line.\n\n126\n00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.540\nNow if I wanted to erase\npart of this line,\n\n127\n00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.470\nI could without affecting\nthe background layer.\n\n128\n00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.650\nSo let me demonstrate that for you.\n\n129\n00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.760\nSo I'm gonna come over\nhere to the Eraser tool.\n\n130\n00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.800\nAnd I'm just going to\nerase part of the line.\n\n131\n00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.850\nAnd you'll notice that the white\nbackground didn't disappear at all.\n\n132\n00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.710\nOkay, this is the layers-based system.\n\n133\n00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.960\nAll right, let's say that I don't\nwant to look at my line anymore.\n\n134\n00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.880\nSo for some reason,\nI just don't want to look at it.\n\n135\n00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.360\nI want to move on to something\nelse in my document.\n\n136\n00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.450\nWhat I can do is hide visibility.\n\n137\n00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.170\nSo you'll notice to each one of\nyour layers you have an eyeball.\n\n138\n00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.380\nThat indicates whether you have\nvisibility turned on or off.\n\n139\n00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.882\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nclick Off, and\n\n140\n00:06:03.882 --> 00:06:06.990\nnow it looks like we have\na blank document again.\n\n141\n00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.377\n>> A mutual friend of ours says you gotta\npoke the eye to turn off the layer, right?\n\n142\n00:06:10.377 --> 00:06:12.630\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n143\n00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.160\nSo I'm gonna put this line back on.\n\n144\n00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.670\nAnd I'm actually going to show you\nhow to duplicate this layer now.\n\n145\n00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.560\nSo I really like what\nthis line looks like.\n\n146\n00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.960\nIt's kinda like a hair curl.\n\n147\n00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.200\nWe're gonna go with it.\n\n148\n00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.340\nI'm going to duplicate it.\n\n149\n00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.120\nNow, there are several different\nways to duplicate in Photoshop.\n\n150\n00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.798\nThe first way I'm gonna show you is\nby right-clicking on the layer,.\n\n151\n00:06:29.798 --> 00:06:32.135\nSo let's go ahead and right-click,\n\n152\n00:06:32.135 --> 00:06:35.880\nand you'll notice that there\nis a little flyout menu.\n\n153\n00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.270\nI'm going to select Duplicate Layer, okay?\n\n154\n00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.170\nHere you can name it.\n\n155\n00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.259\nSo I'm going to name mine.\n\n156\n00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:45.720\nInstead of Line Copy,\nI'm gonna name it Line 2.\n\n157\n00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.280\nOkay, so now we have a separate line.\n\n158\n00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.250\nYou can't really tell it looks any\ndifferent because it layers right on top\n\n159\n00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.640\nof the other, so I'm going to show\nyou how to make sure it's there.\n\n160\n00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.750\nOne, you can check the visibility,\nor you could use your Move tool.\n\n161\n00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.910\nSo your Move tool, again, is that top\ntool all the way over to the left.\n\n162\n00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.650\nWe just learned about it.\n\n163\n00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.980\nSo select your Move tool, click, hold and\n\n164\n00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.807\ndrag, and now, magically,\n>> Voila.\n\n165\n00:07:06.807 --> 00:07:08.618\n>> We have more than one line.\n\n166\n00:07:08.618 --> 00:07:11.190\n[LAUGH] So that's one way of duplicating.\n\n167\n00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.640\nAgain that's by right-clicking and\nselecting Duplicate Layer.\n\n168\n00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.220\nLet's say you wanna do it a faster way.\n\n169\n00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.750\nAnother way that you can do is by\nselecting your layer in your Layers panel\n\n170\n00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.480\nand then dragging it down\nto the New Layer button.\n\n171\n00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.565\nAgain, you'll see we have Line 2 Copy.\n\n172\n00:07:28.565 --> 00:07:30.621\nIt automatically names\nit with Copy at the end.\n\n173\n00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:32.339\nI'm going to change mine to be Line 3.\n\n174\n00:07:34.777 --> 00:07:37.590\nOkay, and\nI'm gonna use the Move tool again.\n\n175\n00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.600\nMove it over here.\n\n176\n00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.590\n>> Nice.\n\n177\n00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:47.380\n>> Okay, my last and favorite way to\nduplicate is by using the ALT key.\n\n178\n00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.535\nSo what we're going to do is make sure\nthat you are on the correct layer and\n\n179\n00:07:50.535 --> 00:07:52.053\nyou have your Move tool selected.\n\n180\n00:07:52.053 --> 00:07:55.234\nAnd select ALT or Option on your keyboard.\n\n181\n00:07:55.234 --> 00:07:58.879\nAnd you'll notice that\na little double arrow pops up.\n\n182\n00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:01.098\nThat's to show you that you\ncan duplicate something.\n\n183\n00:08:01.098 --> 00:08:03.072\nSo I'm gonna click,\nhold, and drag it over.\n\n184\n00:08:03.072 --> 00:08:06.115\nAnd there we have another line.\n\n185\n00:08:06.115 --> 00:08:10.625\nSo I'm going to rename this line\nsince again I don’t like it being\n\n186\n00:08:10.625 --> 00:08:14.155\ncalled line3 copy, so\nI'm gonna name it line4.\n\n187\n00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.230\nSo now we have a lot of lines and\nthey feel unorganized.\n\n188\n00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.270\nSo we're going to make\nthem feel organized.\n\n189\n00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.535\nSo one way that you can do that is\nby adding a color coding system to\n\n190\n00:08:25.535 --> 00:08:26.760\nyour layers.\n\n191\n00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.590\nIf you right-click on your layer, again,\nyou'll have the pop-up menu that comes up.\n\n192\n00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.880\nIf you come all the way to the bottom,\nyou'll see you have color options.\n\n193\n00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.300\nSo I'm going to make all my lines\nred since my lines are red.\n\n194\n00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.926\nSo I can come through and\n\n195\n00:08:40.926 --> 00:08:45.816\nI can actually select more than one\nby holding down Shift and clicking.\n\n196\n00:08:48.533 --> 00:08:51.570\nAnd let's make them all red.\n\n197\n00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:55.780\nSo, in your layers panel,\nnow you should have four lines and\n\n198\n00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.720\nthey should all have that red indicator.\n\n199\n00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.760\n>> And now that doesn't affect the color\nof the object or what you've drawn.\n\n200\n00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.400\nIt's just in the layers panel.\n\n201\n00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.472\n>> Correct,\nit's almost like using a highlighter.\n\n202\n00:09:05.472 --> 00:09:08.180\n>> Very good.\n>> It's just to remind you of something.\n\n203\n00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.610\nNow let's say that I wanted all of\nthese lines to be grouped together.\n\n204\n00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.530\nSo what that means is I want\nthem all to be closely related.\n\n205\n00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:20.440\nSo, maybe you are designing a logo, or you\nwere designing some kind of larger shape,\n\n206\n00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.230\nand you wanted everything\nto be interconnected.\n\n207\n00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.940\nSo when you went to the move tool,\nyou moved everything at once.\n\n208\n00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.420\nYou do that with what's\ncalled a layer group.\n\n209\n00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.880\nSo to find your layer groups,\n\n210\n00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.870\nyou're going to come down to the bottom of\nyour layer panel, and instead of clicking\n\n211\n00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:37.260\non that little sticky note icon, you're\ngoing to click on the little folder icon.\n\n212\n00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.510\nIf you hover over it'll\nsay create new group, so\n\n213\n00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.890\nI'm gonna do that, create new group.\n\n214\n00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.500\nAnd I'm going to double\nclick where it says Group 1,\n\n215\n00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.520\nand I'm going to name this lines.\n\n216\n00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.190\nSo right now, if you collapse your folder,\nthere's nothing in it,\n\n217\n00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.440\nit's just an empty folder.\n\n218\n00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.220\nWe need to move these\nlines into our group.\n\n219\n00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.980\nSo how I can do that is I can\nclick hold and drag and drop.\n\n220\n00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:05.435\nOr you can select more than\none by Shift clicking or\n\n221\n00:10:05.435 --> 00:10:10.930\nCtrl clicking and\ndragging them up into this folder as well.\n\n222\n00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.346\nSo now if I collapse, you won't\nsee any of our individual layers,\n\n223\n00:10:14.346 --> 00:10:15.634\nyou just see the folder.\n\n224\n00:10:15.634 --> 00:10:18.634\nAnd you'll notice if we\ngo to our move tool now,\n\n225\n00:10:18.634 --> 00:10:20.893\nwe move all of our lines at one time.\n\n226\n00:10:20.893 --> 00:10:22.559\n>> Very nice.\n\n227\n00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:26.143\nIt quite makes it very easy when you're\nstarting to work with complex shapes or\n\n228\n00:10:26.143 --> 00:10:29.291\nphotos that have a lot of pieces and\nyou're gonna move them as a unit or\n\n229\n00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:30.780\nkinda treat them as a unit.\n\n230\n00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.540\n>> Correct, great.\n\n231\n00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.090\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna add a new kind of layer now.\n\n232\n00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:39.530\nSo again I'm gonna go down to our\nlittle icon, our little sticky icon.\n\n233\n00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.160\nClick on that, and\nnow we have a blank layer.\n\n234\n00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.080\nSo, I'm going to make\nthis one a text layer.\n\n235\n00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.040\nAgain, we haven't gone over the type\ntool in depth, that's completely fine.\n\n236\n00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.880\nJust do it along with me,\nwe're not doing anything advanced.\n\n237\n00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.820\nI'm just going to go over to my T,\nand I need to change the color\n\n238\n00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.140\nfrom red, because it's going to\nbe hard to see the difference.\n\n239\n00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.050\nSo this little icon up at the top,\nthat's your color picker.\n\n240\n00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.520\nI'm just gonna make it black, so\nyou can clearly see the difference.\n\n241\n00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:10.087\nI'm going to single click on our\ndocument to activate our type tool, and\n\n242\n00:11:10.087 --> 00:11:13.131\nI'm just going to call\nthis playing with layers.\n\n243\n00:11:16.714 --> 00:11:19.922\nThis font is a little\nbit difficult to read so\n\n244\n00:11:19.922 --> 00:11:24.510\nI'm just gonna change it to\nan Arial Bold and make it larger.\n\n245\n00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.890\nSo that way you can clearly see it,\nit's right there.\n\n246\n00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.900\nSo this layer is on top right\nnow in our layers panel.\n\n247\n00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.810\nYou can see that because your layer\norder is in your layers panel.\n\n248\n00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:41.140\nNow if I were to move our type layer down,\nyou can see what happens.\n\n249\n00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:45.050\nAll of a sudden,\nthe lines are overlapping the text, okay?\n\n250\n00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.951\nOr if I move it all the way down\nhere under my background layer\n\n251\n00:11:50.352 --> 00:11:52.540\nYou won't be able to see it at all.\n\n252\n00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.960\nSo that's why it's really important to be\nable to keep track of your layer order.\n\n253\n00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.179\nIf anything disappears, chances are it's\nhidden beneath one of the other layers.\n\n254\n00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:02.245\n>> Very good.\n\n255\n00:12:02.245 --> 00:12:05.991\n>> Okay, so I'm going to add a color\ncode to this one as well just so\n\n256\n00:12:05.991 --> 00:12:11.173\nit's easier for us to tell the difference,\nso I'm going to make this one grey, okay?\n\n257\n00:12:11.173 --> 00:12:14.606\nAll right, so\nnow we have different kinds of layers,\n\n258\n00:12:14.606 --> 00:12:19.660\nI'm going to add a shape last, so let's\ngo ahead and create a new layer again.\n\n259\n00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.420\nAnd this time I'm going to create a shape.\n\n260\n00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.480\nSo our shapes are over here on the left.\n\n261\n00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.230\nYours is probably\ndefaulted to a rectangle.\n\n262\n00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.370\nYou can use whatever shape you want.\n\n263\n00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:34.930\nYou just click, hold, and\ndrag out a shape, okay.\n\n264\n00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.040\nThere we go.\nThere's my shape.\n\n265\n00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.450\nSo I have a shapes layer now.\n\n266\n00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:42.602\nAnd I'm going to move it\nbeneath our lines, okay?\n\n267\n00:12:44.485 --> 00:12:46.990\nSo there, now we have this cool,\nkind of overlapping effect.\n\n268\n00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.616\nI'll make the box a little bit bigger so\nyou can really see how that's working out.\n\n269\n00:12:50.616 --> 00:12:52.138\n>> Very cool.\n\n270\n00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:55.859\n>> Yeah, I'll go ahead and give\na color code to this as well, just for\n\n271\n00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:57.650\norganizational purposes.\n\n272\n00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.170\nAgain, you don't have to use color codes,\nbut\n\n273\n00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:02.250\nit's very helpful if you\nhave a big layer document.\n\n274\n00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.060\nI mean, you might have a hundred\nlayers in your document.\n\n275\n00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.560\n>> Wow.\n>> It helps to have them organized.\n\n276\n00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.260\nNow, what might have happened to you\nif you did drag the rectangle to make\n\n277\n00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.350\nthe lines, you may have accidentally\ndropped it into your lines folder.\n\n278\n00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:19.000\nIf you did,\nnow it's part of your lines folder group.\n\n279\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.300\nSo that's an issue.\n\n280\n00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.410\nWhat you need to do is pull it\nout from there, and just drag and\n\n281\n00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:27.760\ndrop it outside of the folder, okay?\n\n282\n00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.760\nAll right, so\nlet's say that you like this box here, but\n\n283\n00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.610\nyou're not crazy about it, you're thinking\nmaybe I should have gone with the square,\n\n284\n00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.130\nmaybe I should have gone with the circle.\n\n285\n00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.570\nWhat you can do is delete your layer.\n\n286\n00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.630\nSo just like everything else in Photoshop,\n\n287\n00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.470\nthere are tons of different\nways to delete a layer.\n\n288\n00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:48.690\nThe easiest way is to select your layer\nin the layers panel and hit delete.\n\n289\n00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.120\n>> Easy enough.\n>> Easy enough.\n\n290\n00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.820\nI'm gonna undo what I just did so\nyou can see other ways to delete.\n\n291\n00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.530\nAnother way to delete is by clicking and\nholding it and dragging it down\n\n292\n00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:00.370\nto the trash can that's in the bottom\nportion of your layers panel.\n\n293\n00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.710\nThat's another way to delete.\n\n294\n00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:09.228\nThen again, yet another way to delete\nis by right clicking on your layer,\n\n295\n00:14:09.228 --> 00:14:11.721\nand deleting from there, okay?\n\n296\n00:14:11.721 --> 00:14:14.067\nNow, if you choose your\nright click method,\n\n297\n00:14:14.067 --> 00:14:16.800\nit will say are you sure you\nwant to delete the layer?\n\n298\n00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.990\nClick Yes, you're good to go, okay.\n\n299\n00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:26.000\nSo there's also a concept called\nflattening layers in Photoshop.\n\n300\n00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.570\nSo flattening layers,\nlet's think back to our paper, okay.\n\n301\n00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.160\nSo these little papers\nthat we had together,\n\n302\n00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.530\nflattening would be as if we'd glued\nthem together with super glue.\n\n303\n00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:38.000\nSo now they're all attached and\n\n304\n00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.900\nyou can't pull one apart from the other,\nthat's what flattening layers is.\n\n305\n00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.840\n>> Irreversible.\n\n306\n00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.510\n>> It's irreversible.\n\n307\n00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:44.040\n>> Gotch you.\n\n308\n00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.490\n>> So if you need to flatten your layers,\n\n309\n00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.130\nyou gonna want another copy\nof your Photoshop documents.\n\n310\n00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.010\n>> Just in case.\n\n311\n00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:54.580\n>> Just in case, because once you flatten\nyour layers it becomes one layer.\n\n312\n00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:58.210\nWhich means you can't edit each individual\nlayer, you can't add special effects,\n\n313\n00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:02.090\nyou can't change the colors to\njust one thing very easily.\n\n314\n00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:02.600\n>> Okay.\n\n315\n00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.290\n>> Okay, all right, so\n\n316\n00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.720\nlet's talk about these thumbnails that\nare to the left of the layer names.\n\n317\n00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.980\nYou'll notice that the type has a T,\nbackground's just blank,\n\n318\n00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:16.400\nour lines if we open up our folder you'll\nnotice that they're transparent with,\n\n319\n00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.660\nyou can barely see it, but\nthere's a little red line there.\n\n320\n00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:24.140\nNow, these thumbnails help tell\nyou what kind of layer this is.\n\n321\n00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.350\nSo, any kind of text layer will have a T.\n\n322\n00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:31.070\nIf it's something called a smart object,\nso something that you placed into\n\n323\n00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:35.780\nPhotoshop, like a picture, it'll have\na little icon in the corner, okay?\n\n324\n00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.790\nOr if you had a shape, it would\nhave a shape in the corner as well.\n\n325\n00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:42.385\nThis also helps you figure\nout which layers are what.\n\n326\n00:15:42.385 --> 00:15:46.380\n[LAUGH] Now a great thing in Photoshop,\nis you can actually search\n\n327\n00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:51.610\nthrough your layers if you use a color\ncoding system, or if you add a filter.\n\n328\n00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.929\nSo right to the right of\nwhere it says the word kind,\n\n329\n00:15:54.929 --> 00:15:57.104\nyou'll see you can sort by type.\n\n330\n00:15:57.104 --> 00:15:59.525\nSo I'm going to look just for type layers.\n\n331\n00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:04.296\nSo if I click on the T, you'll notice\nmy layer panel only has the type.\n\n332\n00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:06.155\nLittle layer there.\n\n333\n00:16:06.155 --> 00:16:11.920\nOkay, same thing if I were to\ndo an image which our lines are.\n\n334\n00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.285\nOr if I'd had a shape,\nyou can sort that way as well.\n\n335\n00:16:14.285 --> 00:16:17.620\n>> I'd say, that'd be very handy if you're\nto add a document, like you were saying,\n\n336\n00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.300\nwith 100 different layers on it, being\nable to get to the type of layer at least,\n\n337\n00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.000\nnow you got a much shorter\nlist to go through.\n\n338\n00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.630\n>> Exactly.\n>> Yeah.\n\n339\n00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.180\n>> Exactly, it's a big time saver.\n\n340\n00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.640\nOkay, so,\na few other things about the layers panel.\n\n341\n00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.500\nSo, we've been talking about\nthis whole idea of a group.\n\n342\n00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.648\nLet's say that you didn't want\nsomething grouped anymore.\n\n343\n00:16:34.648 --> 00:16:38.609\nOkay, so one of these lines you wanted to\ntake out, because you want to do something\n\n344\n00:16:38.609 --> 00:16:42.270\nelse with, you can, again,\ndrag it outside of the folder.\n\n345\n00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:45.270\nAnd now it's all of sudden ungrouped,\n\n346\n00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:48.370\nwhich means you can move it\nseparate from everything else.\n\n347\n00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.860\nSo grouping is kind of like,\nas if you were to take those\n\n348\n00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:55.460\npaper layers that I showed you,\nand put a strip of tape over them.\n\n349\n00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.420\nSo maybe it's some duct tape,\nsomething that's not super abrasive.\n\n350\n00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:01.196\nSo, when you pull it off you still can\nseparate the layers from each other.\n\n351\n00:17:01.196 --> 00:17:03.215\n>> A little less permanent\nthan flattening layers.\n\n352\n00:17:03.215 --> 00:17:06.170\n>> Yes, precisely, precisely.\n\n353\n00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:10.430\nOkay, so there are a few other things in\nthis layers panel that are helpful to you.\n\n354\n00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.930\nJust to note, we are gonna be going over\nthem in the future when we talk about\n\n355\n00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.620\nthings like blending modes and\nadjustments.\n\n356\n00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:19.380\nBut just so you know where they are now,\nwe're gonna talk about them briefly.\n\n357\n00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.790\nSo you'll see, you probably have a word\nthat says normal here, if you don't,\n\n358\n00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.270\nit just defaults into\nanother blending mode.\n\n359\n00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:30.190\nThese are blending modes and\nthey're used very often in photography.\n\n360\n00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:35.840\nSo let's say that you wanted to layer an\nimage over itself a few times, you can add\n\n361\n00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.300\none of these different options and it will\ncompletely change the look of your photo.\n\n362\n00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.110\nSo again, we're gonna be going over\nthose more in depth when we talk about\n\n363\n00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:44.940\nphotography, but\n\n364\n00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.740\nthat's where that is in case you're\nwondering what a blending mode is.\n\n365\n00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.560\nOkay, so the filter is off to the right,\nyou can turn it on or off.\n\n366\n00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:57.350\nThen to the right of Normal\nyou have Opacity and Fill.\n\n367\n00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:01.190\nSo Opacity and\nFill Are measures of transparency.\n\n368\n00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:05.740\nSo let's go ahead and test this out\nwith this line that I have selected.\n\n369\n00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:08.740\nSo our line two, you can do it on\nanything you want, but I'm going to\n\n370\n00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:13.130\nlower the opacity, which means you're\ngoing to be able to see through it.\n\n371\n00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.930\nSo you'll notice that it's\ngetting more faded and\n\n372\n00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.700\nfaded because I'm adjusting the opacity.\n\n373\n00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.130\nNow we're gonna do\nthe same thing with fill.\n\n374\n00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:23.760\nSo fill, I'm gonna drop it down from 100.\n\n375\n00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.190\nAnd you'll notice it looks\npretty much identical.\n\n376\n00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:31.370\nThe reason why, is because opacity and\nfill essentially do the same thing, but\n\n377\n00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:35.240\nthey react differently if you\nhave layer styles on them.\n\n378\n00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.010\nSo, if you had a drop shadow, or\n\n379\n00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.040\nif you had some kind of stroke\nThey would react differently.\n\n380\n00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.460\n>> Okay.\n\n381\n00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:41.960\n>> Okay.\n\n382\n00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.460\nAll right.\nRight beneath that,\n\n383\n00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.120\nyou'll see you have lock.\n\n384\n00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.680\nSo these are all your\ndifferent locking options.\n\n385\n00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.680\nOkay.\nSo if you wanted to lock your transparent\n\n386\n00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.730\npixels, you can do that.\n\n387\n00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.060\nYou can lock your image pixels.\n\n388\n00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.089\nYou can lock the position\nof whatever the item is.\n\n389\n00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:04.730\nYou can prevent moving in and out of art\nboards of you're using art boards, and\n\n390\n00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:09.010\nyou can use just the standard lock button,\nwhich might be the option that you have.\n\n391\n00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:15.060\nSo you can do lock all, or you can select\na certain layer and hit our lock icon So\n\n392\n00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.010\nnow that it's locked, I'm not going\nto be able to do anything to it.\n\n393\n00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:20.200\nSo I'm gonna come over\nhere to my move tool.\n\n394\n00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.020\nIt's not letting me do a thing now,\nnothing.\n\n395\n00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:27.230\nSee, and it says, could not use the move\ntool because the layer is locked.\n\n396\n00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:28.942\n>> That's nice of it to tell you.\n\n397\n00:19:28.942 --> 00:19:29.455\n>> Yes.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n398\n00:19:29.455 --> 00:19:31.415\n>> So there is several reasons why you\n\n399\n00:19:31.415 --> 00:19:33.080\nmight want to lock a layer.\n\n400\n00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.830\nLet's say that you are doing\nthis amazing project and\n\n401\n00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.930\nyou really like what one\nof your layers looks like.\n\n402\n00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:41.370\nAnd you're afraid that you're accidentally\ngoing to make an edit to it and\n\n403\n00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:45.380\nyou don't want to make an edit,\nyou would lock your layer than.\n\n404\n00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:49.360\n>> Yeah, I've seen certain way, if you've\ngot a line on top of some complex thing,\n\n405\n00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.630\nsometimes it can be hard to click\nright on that line and move it.\n\n406\n00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.850\nYou end up clicking underneath it and\nYup, like it.\n\n407\n00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:57.410\n>> Precisely.\n[LAUGH] Okay,\n\n408\n00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.780\nand then if you come down to\nthe bottom of our layers panel.\n\n409\n00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:06.150\nYou have an active layer selected,\nyou'll notice that we have an FX button.\n\n410\n00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:07.950\nThis FX, these are your special effects.\n\n411\n00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:09.830\nTheir your layer styles.\n\n412\n00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:12.280\nSo if you wanted to add\nsomething like a dropped shadow,\n\n413\n00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.910\nthis is where you would do it.\n\n414\n00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:14.700\nSo I'll go ahead and\n\n415\n00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.330\nshow you an example, let's just do\na drop shot since that I had mentioned.\n\n416\n00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:22.060\nI'm just going to click OK,\nnow you'll notice that we have a very\n\n417\n00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:25.430\ncrazy looking-drop shot, probably not\nthe kind of drop shot you're going to want\n\n418\n00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:30.660\nto see on your document but at least\nnow you see this has an effect now.\n\n419\n00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.980\nSo you'll notice this does have\nan effect and in the Layer panel you'll\n\n420\n00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:38.220\nsee it looks different You'll see there's\nan FX and a little arrow next to it.\n\n421\n00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:42.000\nSo this arrow allows you to\ncollapse the effect, okay?\n\n422\n00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.880\nSo if I didn't want to see the effect.\n\n423\n00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.830\nYou might have five different\neffects on one layer.\n\n424\n00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.520\nIt makes your layers panel really long.\n\n425\n00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.030\n>> Hm.\n\n426\n00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:48.910\n>> It's probably not what you want.\n\n427\n00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.170\nSo you'll probably want to collapse them.\n\n428\n00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:54.080\nThe other thing that you can do with your\nlayer styles now that they're in your\n\n429\n00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:58.020\nlayers panel is you can hit\nthe visibility icon on that as well.\n\n430\n00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.080\n>> Neat.\n>> So you can hit it for all effects or\n\n431\n00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.380\nyou can select one specific effect.\n\n432\n00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.040\nSo maybe you've added several effects and\nyour trying to figure out\n\n433\n00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.850\nwhich one kinda threw off the image, you\ncan do that by adjusting your visibility.\n\n434\n00:21:11.603 --> 00:21:12.103\nOkay.\n\n435\n00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:17.980\nAll right and then you can also\ndo something called a layer mask.\n\n436\n00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.620\nA layer mask is something that we're\ngoing to be going over in depth in\n\n437\n00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:21.450\na future lesson.\n\n438\n00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.700\nBut this is where you would find it.\n\n439\n00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.710\nLayer masks are great because\nthey allow you to edit\n\n440\n00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:29.810\nthe layer without destroying\nall of the pixels.\n\n441\n00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:32.510\nSo it's a less damaging way\nto erase than an eraser.\n\n442\n00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:34.760\nOkay?\n\n443\n00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.230\nYou also have Fill and\nAdjustment Layers as well, so\n\n444\n00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.800\nif you wanted to add a color fill,\nyou could do that.\n\n445\n00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.070\nOr if you wanted to add an adjustment\nfill, which would be something like\n\n446\n00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.120\nbrightness and contrast, you can do\nthat at the bottom of your layers panel.\n\n447\n00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.230\nVery cool.\n\n448\n00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.470\n>> Then again, you have your group icon,\nyou have your new layer icon, and\n\n449\n00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:55.440\nyou have your delete layer icon,\nor your trashcan..\n\n450\n00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.700\nSo any questions about anything\nthat we've gone over with layers?\n\n451\n00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.940\n>> Nope, good with questions, I think\nyou did a great job explaining layers.\n\n452\n00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.090\nWe have a good understanding\nof what we can do with those.\n\n453\n00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:07.170\nSo thank you for that.\n\n454\n00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.290\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n455\n00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:10.740\nRemember, we got more coming your way.\n\n456\n00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.010\nBut signing off for now, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n457\n00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:13.830\n>> And I'm Kara Page.\n\n458\n00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.785\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n459\n00:22:15.785 --> 00:22:22.085\n[SOUND]\n\n",

--> 00:00:16.860\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.790\nAnd today we're gonna be doing\nAdobe Photoshop CC 2015, and specifically,\n\n5\n00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.920\nwe're gonna be looking at ways to\nselect objects in our project.\n\n6\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.180\nAnd here to help us with that is Ms.\nKara Page, how's it going Kara?\n\n7\n00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.780\n>> I'm great and let's go ahead and\njust dive right into selections,\n\n8\n00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.440\ncuz it's something that's a little\nbit more complicated in Photoshop.\n\n9\n00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.580\nSo this is the first time we're\ntaking a big step towards something\n\n10\n00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.320\ngreat with Photoshop.\n\n11\n00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.370\n>> All right.\n\n12\n00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.810\nSo what we're gonna do is we\nare going to open the cookies image.\n\n13\n00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.930\nSo you can find the cookie image along\nwith your book, so let's go ahead and\n\n14\n00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.830\ngo to open, and it's called cookies.jpeg.\n\n15\n00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.210\nSo, again I hope you've had a snack-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.050\n>> Because you might get a little hungry.\n\n17\n00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.040\n>> Too late.\n\n18\n00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.310\n>> Right, let's go ahead and open that up.\n\n19\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.880\nSo there we have our layer.\n\n20\n00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.510\nAnd you'll notice that it's locked.\n\n21\n00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.940\nIn order to make a selection,\nwe're going to have to unlock it.\n\n22\n00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.300\nSo, let's go ahead and hit our little lock\nkey, which you've just learned about.\n\n23\n00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.830\nWe're gonna rename it and\nI'm gonna name it \"cookies\".\n\n24\n00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.680\nOkay.\nSo now we have a cookies background layer,\n\n25\n00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.050\nit's unlocked, now we can go ahead and\ndo something called selection.\n\n26\n00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.980\nSelections allow you to\nselect part of an image.\n\n27\n00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.790\nThere are several different\nselection tools in Photoshop.\n\n28\n00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.240\nSo we're going to walk through each\none and you can see what they do.\n\n29\n00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.520\nYour selection tools are over on\nthe left hand side in your Tool panel.\n\n30\n00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.900\nThe default top tool for your selection\ntools is the rectangular marquee tool.\n\n31\n00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.000\nSo if you click on that, you'll be\nable to see it's a dotted rectangle.\n\n32\n00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.900\nSo I'm going to just kind of select my\nname out of this little cookies section.\n\n33\n00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.260\nSo now that we have it selected you'll see\nthese running ants, these dotted lines.\n\n34\n00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.060\nLet's go ahead and zoom in so\nwe can further see what we're doing.\n\n35\n00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.070\nSo I'm going to hit the Cmd++ or Ctrl++\nAgain, we've learned about that before.\n\n36\n00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.365\nSo that way you can see my\nname up front and center.\n\n37\n00:02:04.365 --> 00:02:05.450\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n38\n00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.140\n>> So let's say I don't like\nthe way that I selected that,\n\n39\n00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.790\nmaybe I cut off one of the letters,\nwhat I can do is deselect.\n\n40\n00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.493\nSo I can do CMD+D or\n\n41\n00:02:12.493 --> 00:02:16.860\nCTRL+D to deselect, that will get\nrid of your running ants, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.090\nI'm gonna try for that selection again,\nso I'm gonna draw my rectangle And\n\n43\n00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.320\nI like this one but\nI feel like I need to add to it.\n\n44\n00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.670\nSo you can add to a selection\nup in the very top left corner.\n\n45\n00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.360\nIf you hover over these overlapping\nsquares it'll say something like add to\n\n46\n00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.760\nselection, subtract from selection,\nor intersect with selection.\n\n47\n00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.980\nSo I'm going to add to this selection.\n\n48\n00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.200\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngoing to draw a box above it.\n\n49\n00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.800\nAnd now all of a sudden\nmy box is a lot bigger.\n\n50\n00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.820\nSo now I have my entire name there.\n\n51\n00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.190\n>> Very good.\n\n52\n00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.850\n>> Okay?\n\n53\n00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.560\nSo same thing is true,\nlet's say I got too much now.\n\n54\n00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.130\nI'm going to go ahead and\nsubtract from selection.\n\n55\n00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.990\nSo I'm going to just get\nrid of this top part.\n\n56\n00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.880\nThis is just a little too much in\ntheir refines our selection even more.\n\n57\n00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.890\nSo now I have it selected but\nwhat does that even mean.\n\n58\n00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.170\nSo it's selected, what am I doing with it.\n\n59\n00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.120\nSo if you just keep it as is,\nit's not really doing anything.\n\n60\n00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.360\nIt's just showing you what\nyou have on your document.\n\n61\n00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.810\nWhat your trying to select.\n\n62\n00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.500\nLet's say that I wanted to move it.\n\n63\n00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.260\nYou could move it if you go to your move\ntool, which is up at the very top corner.\n\n64\n00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.220\nAnd then you'll notice\nwhen you hover over,\n\n65\n00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.700\nthere's a little arrow with scissors.\n\n66\n00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.210\nThat means that you're gonna cut it, which\nis probably not what you wanna do, but\n\n67\n00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.280\nwe're gonna try it out.\n\n68\n00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.250\nSo there we go, I moved my name, which\nmight be a good thing especially if you\n\n69\n00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.160\nhave a white background, you're just\ntrying to move something slightly.\n\n70\n00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.190\nBut it looks kind of silly with mine,\nbecause I had a textured background.\n\n71\n00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.340\nSo I'm going to undo that.\n\n72\n00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.180\nAnother thing that you can do is,\n\n73\n00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.450\nnow that you have your selection, is you\ncan actually create a new selection.\n\n74\n00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.340\nSo I'm going to do Command C or Control C.\n\n75\n00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.630\nAnd Command V or Control V.\n\n76\n00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.820\nNow you'll notice in my layers\npanel I have two layers now.\n\n77\n00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.840\nThis top layer is a duplicate copy\nof what I just selected, okay.\n\n78\n00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.750\n>> So not the entire layer, but\njust what you had selected.\n\n79\n00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:15.290\n>> Exactly.\n\n80\n00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.435\nSo I'm going to now move my name and\nI'm just gonna cut Nick out.\n\n81\n00:04:18.435 --> 00:04:20.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it's just gonna be Kara and\n\n82\n00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.990\nKara because that's what\nthese cookies are all about.\n\n83\n00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.630\n>> Nick is not happy.\n[LAUGH]\n\n84\n00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.700\n>> No, not at all.\n\n85\n00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.310\nSo, I'm going to rename this so\nwe know it's a care a copy.\n\n86\n00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.870\nOkay.\nSo, I just need a quick little selection.\n\n87\n00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.780\nEasy enough,\nit was a rectangular marquee tool.\n\n88\n00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.300\nLet's move on to our next marquee tool.\n\n89\n00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.750\nSo, if you click and\nhold down on our rectangular marquee tool,\n\n90\n00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.750\nyou can select\nthe elliptical marquee tool.\n\n91\n00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.600\nThis is a circle, so I can draw a circle\naround something I want to select, so\n\n92\n00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.160\nI'm going to create a circle around\nthis little flower shaped cookie.\n\n93\n00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.710\nNow, I kind of missed it a little bit,\nyou can nudge your selection.\n\n94\n00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.480\nThe way that you nudge a selection in\nPhotoshop is by using your arrow tools.\n\n95\n00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.190\nSo I'm going to just kind\nof nudge it a little bit.\n\n96\n00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.920\nAnd there, that's better,\nthat's what I want.\n\n97\n00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.010\nNow if I wanted to make a copy\nagain I could, so I'm gonna Ctrl+Z.\n\n98\n00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.080\nSee here I'm gonna do that again for you.\n\n99\n00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.190\nThere's an error message that says could\nnot complete the Copy command because\n\n100\n00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.580\nthe selected area is empty.\n\n101\n00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.240\nWhat does that even mean,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n102\n00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.220\nSo let's look back at our Layers panel and\nmake sure we're on the correct layer.\n\n103\n00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.740\nWhich I;m not, I need to be on my\ncookie's layer because that's where this\n\n104\n00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.230\nlittle flower cookie exist.\n\n105\n00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.595\nIt doesn't exist on the Kara copy layer.\n\n106\n00:05:35.595 --> 00:05:39.370\n>> So there was really nothing at that\nspot where you had selected on that Kara\n\n107\n00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.990\ncopy layer.\n\n108\n00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.141\nEven though it looks like it,\nbut there just stacked up there.\n\n109\n00:05:43.141 --> 00:05:44.050\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n110\n00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.270\nSo, I'm going to create a copy,\npaste a copy, and\n\n111\n00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.406\nnow I have a copy of this flower cookie.\n\n112\n00:05:49.406 --> 00:05:55.530\nI'm going to rename it, and\nI'm going to move it over here.\n\n113\n00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.960\nI'm going to make it smaller, so\n\n114\n00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.055\nthat way it just looks like I\nmade more cookies than I did.\n\n115\n00:06:00.055 --> 00:06:01.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n116\n00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.730\nAll right, so\n\n117\n00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.610\nnow we've gone over the Rectangular\nMarquee tool, the Elliptical Marquee tool.\n\n118\n00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.460\nTime to see what other types\nof Marquee tools we have.\n\n119\n00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.960\nThe next one is a single row marquee tool.\n\n120\n00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.860\nSo that's if you wanted to select\na single row of your document,\n\n121\n00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.430\nit's probably not something\nthat you're going to use very\n\n122\n00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.880\noften unless you're\nworking on a pixel level.\n\n123\n00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.320\nSo again you might not use it,\n\n124\n00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.610\nyour rectangular and\nellipse are much more common.\n\n125\n00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.566\nSo when you say single row,\nyou mean single row of pixels?\n\n126\n00:06:31.566 --> 00:06:33.153\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n127\n00:06:33.153 --> 00:06:35.009\n>> Wow, okay.\n\n128\n00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:40.020\n>> Okay, so now let's go ahead onto\nour next type of selection tool.\n\n129\n00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.660\nThey're called Lasso tools.\n\n130\n00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.080\nSo Lassos are really fun\nLooks like cowboy's lasso,\n\n131\n00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.300\nthat's what your gonna be doing.\n\n132\n00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.920\n>> Woo hoo.\n\n133\n00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.710\n>> So I'm gonna warn you now that\nlassoes take a little bit of\n\n134\n00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.120\npractice to get good at.\n\n135\n00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.300\nSo don't fret, just keep practicing, it's\nsomething that you'll refine over time.\n\n136\n00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.460\nSo we're going to select the lasso tool.\n\n137\n00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.040\nIt's over here on the left and\nit looks like a little cowboy lasso.\n\n138\n00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.210\nThe short cut is an L.\n\n139\n00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.100\nOkay?\nSo if you want\n\n140\n00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.160\nto get good at shortcuts\njust remember this is the l.\n\n141\n00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.610\nSo what this allows you to do is to\nbe more precise with your selections.\n\n142\n00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.750\nSo instead of just getting\na big box full of content or\n\n143\n00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.600\na circle full of content,\nnow we can be more specific.\n\n144\n00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.840\nSo let's say that I wanted\nto just get this k.\n\n145\n00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.181\nWhat I would do is I would click,\nhold and drag around it,\n\n146\n00:07:27.181 --> 00:07:29.447\nalmost like I'm tracing it.\n\n147\n00:07:31.835 --> 00:07:33.450\nAnd you just keep going.\n\n148\n00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.970\nDon't worry, it does take some time,\n\n149\n00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.520\nespecially if you're doing\nreally minute details.\n\n150\n00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.318\nSo don't get frustrated, the Lasso\ntools can sometimes be frustrating.\n\n151\n00:07:41.318 --> 00:07:44.920\n[LAUGH] But I went all the way\naround the K and you see when I\n\n152\n00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.620\nconnected back to my original point it\nturned into our dotted little lines.\n\n153\n00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.585\nThese are selection lines.\n\n154\n00:07:50.585 --> 00:07:53.888\nSo I'm going to make sure\nI'm on my cookies layer and\n\n155\n00:07:53.888 --> 00:07:57.805\nI'll just show you what it would\nlook like if I were to move it.\n\n156\n00:07:57.805 --> 00:08:01.625\nSo now I just have my K selected.\n\n157\n00:08:01.625 --> 00:08:02.888\n>> But a lot more specific,\n\n158\n00:08:02.888 --> 00:08:07.270\nlike when we drew the box, we kinda got\nsome pieces of the other cookies in there.\n\n159\n00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.600\nThis allows you to really get in and\nfocus that selection.\n\n160\n00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.050\n>> Precisely,\nthat's exactly what it lets you do.\n\n161\n00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.570\nSo I'm going to just go ahead and\nde-select that.\n\n162\n00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.120\nSo that's just our regular lasso tool.\n\n163\n00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.930\nIt's great for an organic shape.\n\n164\n00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.520\nSo an organic shape is something\nlike a leaf or a cloud,\n\n165\n00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.740\nsomething that you'd find in\nnature that isn't very geometric.\n\n166\n00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.230\nSo you're not focused on your\nright angles, your obtuse.\n\n167\n00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.520\nYou're not focused on that at all.\n\n168\n00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.100\nIt's just more free flowing,\nso lasso's great for that.\n\n169\n00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.800\nLet's see what other kind of lasso tools\nwe have available at our disposal.\n\n170\n00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:43.820\nSo if you click on the lasso tool, and\nyou clicked on polygonal lasso tool,\n\n171\n00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.240\nthat will allow you to\nselect in straight lines.\n\n172\n00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.050\nSo I'm going to try it out with our little\ntriangular cookie in the bottom left.\n\n173\n00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.970\nSo I'm going to zoom in a little bit.\n\n174\n00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.800\nSo I'm going to go to my companion plus\nand now you'll notice I zoomed in but\n\n175\n00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.040\nthat's not the part of the image I want.\n\n176\n00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.300\nSo we're going to hit the space bar.\n\n177\n00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:01.880\nAs a reminder,\n\n178\n00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.360\nthe space bar brings up our hand tool\nIt allows us to move in our document.\n\n179\n00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:12.950\nSo now I can clearly see on the screen\nI have my little triangle cookie.\n\n180\n00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.050\nI'm going to use my\npolygonal lasso tool for it.\n\n181\n00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.460\nSo remember where you do your\nfirst click always because\n\n182\n00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.210\nthat is your anchor point you're going\nto have to connect to at the end.\n\n183\n00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.130\nSo it's single click and\n\n184\n00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.730\nnow you'll notice I'm not holding\ndown on my mouse at all this time.\n\n185\n00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.350\nAnd what I'm doing is I'm\njust dragging out from it.\n\n186\n00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:31.560\nSo if you just single click and\n\n187\n00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.840\ndrag, you'll see that you're\ncreating a straight line.\n\n188\n00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.350\nOkay, I'm just going to go ahead and\nclick it.\n\n189\n00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:43.030\nI'm going to kind of make this a squared\noff corner come back around here.\n\n190\n00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:45.800\nSingle click again.\n\n191\n00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:53.040\nClick and come back over here and\nI'll need to connect it.\n\n192\n00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.990\nNow I'm not sure if you can see this but\n\n193\n00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.000\nit's a little icon that has the lasso\ntool with a little circle on the end.\n\n194\n00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.920\nThat is showing you where\nyour anchor point is.\n\n195\n00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.950\nSo if you single click,\nIt will create a selection.\n\n196\n00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.784\nIf you don't find your original point,\nyou're going to be searching.\n\n197\n00:10:08.784 --> 00:10:12.140\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Where you started.\n\n198\n00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.560\n>> Yes.\nIt's very important.\n\n199\n00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.510\nThat's why it's good to zoom\nin to a really close level, so\n\n200\n00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.850\nyou can see where you are.\n\n201\n00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.840\nSo, here we have another type of\nselections that I'm going to go ahead and\n\n202\n00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.340\nmake this cookie a copy.\n\n203\n00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.806\nSo again I'm gonna CTRL+C, CTRL+V.\n\n204\n00:10:25.806 --> 00:10:28.040\nIt creates a new layer and\n\n205\n00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.030\nwe actually did a pretty good\njob of cutting out this cookie.\n\n206\n00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.140\n>> Yeah, that was really good.\n\n207\n00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:36.290\n>> Yeah, so [COUGH] instead of having all\nthe leftover icing that we had before,\n\n208\n00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:37.170\nnow we've cleaned it up.\n\n209\n00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.190\n>> Now you got a nice, neat cookie.\n\n210\n00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:39.808\n>> Yes,\nnow we look like professional bakers.\n\n211\n00:10:39.808 --> 00:10:43.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so I'm gonna resize this cookie.\n\n212\n00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.310\nAnd move it over here.\n\n213\n00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:48.680\nOkay, so now we've gone over two\ndifferent forms of lasso tools.\n\n214\n00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.200\nIt's time to move on to the next one,\n\n215\n00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.880\nwhich is probably my\nfavorite of the lasso tools.\n\n216\n00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.390\nSo again, let's get our flyout menu.\n\n217\n00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.450\nThis one is called\nthe magnetic lasso tool.\n\n218\n00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.490\nOkay, so\nI'm gonna select back on my cookies layer.\n\n219\n00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.700\nAnd let's find a cookie that would\nbe good for the magnetic lasso.\n\n220\n00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.910\nLet's do this white and\ngreen cookie at the bottom.\n\n221\n00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.790\nIt's our big cookie,\nwe haven't done anything with him yet.\n\n222\n00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.890\nWe're going to single click again and\n\n223\n00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:19.110\nthis time you drag around\nthe edge of your cookie.\n\n224\n00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.360\nI'm going to zoom in so\nyou can really see that here.\n\n225\n00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:27.193\nAnd what it does is it latches onto the\nedge of your cookie as we're going around.\n\n226\n00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.490\nOkay?\nLet's say I make a mistake and\n\n227\n00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.750\nall of a sudden I'm over here and\nI don't want that last point.\n\n228\n00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.430\nWhat you can do is you can hit delete a\nfew times and get back to where you were.\n\n229\n00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.340\nI'll just go ahead and delete a few times.\n\n230\n00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:45.160\nI deleted a few too many times, which\nis fine, just when you're so zoomed in,\n\n231\n00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.250\nit's hard to tell how\nmany points you've made.\n\n232\n00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.630\nSo I'm just gonna keep going around,\nI'm gonna zoom out, so that way,\n\n233\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.960\nyou guys can follow along\nwith me a little bit better.\n\n234\n00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.880\nSo you'll notice it's grabbing on to it,\nbut it might not do the best of jobs.\n\n235\n00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.010\nYou might have to force it to click.\n\n236\n00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.640\nSo I'm going to delete a few points.\n\n237\n00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.140\nI'm gonna come over here and\nactually click.\n\n238\n00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:08.330\nNow, if you force click, it'll tell it\nto kind of reroute what it's doing, so\n\n239\n00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.780\nyou might have to tell Photoshop\na little bit of what to do.\n\n240\n00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.650\nBe the boss here, as you're going around.\n\n241\n00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.560\n>> It looks like it's\ndoing a pretty good job.\n\n242\n00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.990\n>> Yeah.\nThe magnetic lasso tool works the best\n\n243\n00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:22.040\nwhen you have very different backgrounds.\n\n244\n00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.550\nSo our background here is a whitish color,\nso\n\n245\n00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:29.160\nit's not working quite as well as it would\nif you had maybe a black background.\n\n246\n00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.850\nSo, high contrast works really\nwell with the magnetic lasso.\n\n247\n00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:34.000\nSo we're going to keep coming around.\n\n248\n00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.980\nAnd I'm just focusing on getting\nthis icing part right now.\n\n249\n00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.590\nKeep coming around.\n\n250\n00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.710\nAnd then here,\nwe found our anchor point again.\n\n251\n00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.080\nWe have this circle.\n\n252\n00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.710\nSo if you single click there, we have\na selection of our icing on the cookie.\n\n253\n00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:49.210\n>> Nice.\n\n254\n00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.970\n>> Okay.\nI'm gonna show you something that\n\n255\n00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:52.740\nhappens a lot.\n\n256\n00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.440\nIt's probably gonna happen\nto you at some point.\n\n257\n00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.130\nSo you're single-clicking and\nyou're dragging, dragging, dragging.\n\n258\n00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.830\nAnd of a sudden,\nyou just can't get this to go away.\n\n259\n00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:00.920\nAnd you don't know what's going on.\n\n260\n00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.282\nYou keep hitting delete.\n\n261\n00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:03.890\nAnd it works a little bit.\n\n262\n00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:05.680\nGo ahead and just hit escape.\n\n263\n00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.790\nEscape will get rid of\nyour lasso tools here.\n\n264\n00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.970\nJust tell them to go away.\n\n265\n00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:09.900\n>> Start over.\n\n266\n00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.598\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] It can be a little bit\n\n267\n00:13:11.598 --> 00:13:13.789\nintimidating when you're\nstuck in a lasso tool.\n\n268\n00:13:13.789 --> 00:13:16.130\n[LAUGH] So just keep that in mind.\n\n269\n00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.890\nSo I'm gonna show you how the lasso\ntool would work on something that's\n\n270\n00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.030\nhigher contrast.\n\n271\n00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.160\nLet's try it with the A on my name.\n\n272\n00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:27.260\nSo it's single click, then drag around,\nand you'll notice that's doing a really\n\n273\n00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:32.340\ngreat job of selecting\nthe fine edges of this A.\n\n274\n00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.280\nThe reason why, again, is because it\nhas more contrast for the background.\n\n275\n00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.720\n>> Photoshop is able to tell\nthe difference there between the two?\n\n276\n00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.900\n>> Exactly.\n\n277\n00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.600\nThere we go.\nNow we have our A selected.\n\n278\n00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:46.810\nOkay?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n279\n00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:50.150\n>> All right, so now we're gonna talk\nabout this really fun tool called\n\n280\n00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.480\nthe Magic Wand tool and\nthe Quick Selection tool.\n\n281\n00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.130\n>> Mm.\n\n282\n00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.020\n>> So we're gonna open a new document for\nthat,\n\n283\n00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.390\ncuz it works really well when\nyou have white backgrounds.\n\n284\n00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:01.270\nSo I'm going to go to File and\nthis time we're going to go to open,\n\n285\n00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.220\nwe're not going to place\nit into our cookies file,\n\n286\n00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.690\nwe don't need to do\nanything with the cookies.\n\n287\n00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.830\nLet's go to file open, and\n\n288\n00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:13.500\nI'm actually going to select\nsomething out of our pizza, okay.\n\n289\n00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.150\nSo we go ahead and do open, and\n\n290\n00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.990\nthis has a white background, okay,\nso we need to cut these guys out.\n\n291\n00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.440\nyou can use any of your\nlasso tools if you like.\n\n292\n00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.200\nOr you can use the magic wand or\nthe quick selection.\n\n293\n00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.870\nSo let's try the magic wand first.\n\n294\n00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.510\nSo the magic wand is hidden beneath\nthis quick selection tool, so\n\n295\n00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.560\nif you click and hold out.\n\n296\n00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.270\nWhat you're gonna do is you're gonna\nsingle click on the background.\n\n297\n00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:40.410\nAnd what you'll notice that Photoshop\ncan tell where your items are.\n\n298\n00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.730\nOkay.\n\n299\n00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.800\nSo let's go ahead and\nsee what happens if we hit delete.\n\n300\n00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.790\nOkay.\nSo it says fill.\n\n301\n00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:48.690\nThat's good.\n\n302\n00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.975\nSo it filled with my foreground color.\n\n303\n00:14:50.975 --> 00:14:51.980\n>> Um-hm.\n>> Okay.\n\n304\n00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.555\nWhich isn't exactly what we want, so.\n\n305\n00:14:53.555 --> 00:14:55.015\nI'm just gonna undo that.\n\n306\n00:14:55.015 --> 00:14:57.445\nSo you have several different\noptions in Photoshop.\n\n307\n00:14:57.445 --> 00:15:01.205\nIf we wanted to select this item and\nhave it be a transparent background,\n\n308\n00:15:01.205 --> 00:15:03.955\nwe need to add a layer of\ntransparency beneath this.\n\n309\n00:15:03.955 --> 00:15:05.095\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n310\n00:15:05.095 --> 00:15:09.675\nunlock our background layer,\nwe're gonna create a new blank layer.\n\n311\n00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:12.780\nI'm just gonna drag it\nbeneath our vegetables.\n\n312\n00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:13.690\nAnd let's try that again.\n\n313\n00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:14.930\nSo I'm going to hit delete.\n\n314\n00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:18.770\nAnd there we go.\n\n315\n00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.720\nSo you'll notice that it cut\nout some of our mushrooms.\n\n316\n00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.920\nThe reason why it did that is because of\nthe tolerance setting here at the top.\n\n317\n00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:30.350\nSo Photoshop's having a hard time with\nthis mushroom because It thinks that\n\n318\n00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.630\nthe mushroom is part of the background,\nso you can adjust the tolerance or\n\n319\n00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:39.220\nyou can use a variety of selection tools\nto go in and get the rest of the mushroom.\n\n320\n00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.140\nSo, the selection tools don't\nwork independently of each other,\n\n321\n00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.850\nyou can work with them together.\n\n322\n00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:47.380\n>> Nice, so really what you're\ndoing with that magic wand then was\n\n323\n00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:51.480\nnot selecting the vegetable, but\nselecting everything but the vegetables.\n\n324\n00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.495\n>> Right.\n>> Nice.\n\n325\n00:15:52.495 --> 00:15:55.230\n>> Now, what you could do as well,\nis you could select inverse.\n\n326\n00:15:55.230 --> 00:16:00.526\nSo if you go up to select up at the top.\n\n327\n00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:02.715\nYeah, there it is, Select > Inverse.\n\n328\n00:16:02.715 --> 00:16:05.685\nAnd then you'll notice it's only\nselected our vegetables now.\n\n329\n00:16:05.685 --> 00:16:06.280\n>> Okay.\n\n330\n00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.412\n>> So if I hit Delete now,\nI'm cutting out our vegetables.\n\n331\n00:16:09.412 --> 00:16:11.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n332\n00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:12.570\nSo remember inverse-\n>> Doctor says, no.\n\n333\n00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:13.660\nWe gotta keep our vegetables.\n\n334\n00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:14.160\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n335\n00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.220\nExactly. Exactly.\n\n336\n00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:20.370\nSo inverse is available for you if\nyou do want to cut out the opposite.\n\n337\n00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.310\n>> Sometimes it might be easier\njust to select, like you did,\n\n338\n00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:24.240\nthe background first, and\n\n339\n00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.800\nthen just inverse the selection, rather\nthan go very detailed around a selection.\n\n340\n00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.800\n>> Exactly.\n>> Nice.\n\n341\n00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.750\n>> Exactly, so speaking of more\nof the quick type of selections,\n\n342\n00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.740\nwe're gonna try out our\nQuick Selection tool.\n\n343\n00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.140\nSo it's hidden underneath\nour Magic Wand tool now.\n\n344\n00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:38.930\nGo ahead and select it.\n\n345\n00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:41.805\nIt looks kind of like a brush\nwith a dotted line around it.\n\n346\n00:16:41.805 --> 00:16:42.870\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n347\n00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.920\n>> So let's try it out\nwith our pepper over here.\n\n348\n00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:51.570\nSo what we're going to do with our pepper\nis I'm going to single click on it.\n\n349\n00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.540\nAnd you notice, I single clicked on it,\nand it selected the entire pepper.\n\n350\n00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.705\nSo let me zoom in so\nyou can really see that.\n\n351\n00:16:58.111 --> 00:17:01.970\nSo there is selected the entire pepper for\nus with just a single click.\n\n352\n00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:03.200\n>> Nice, that is quick.\n\n353\n00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:03.849\n>> It is quick.\n\n354\n00:17:03.849 --> 00:17:06.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah it's great, so let's try it again.\n\n355\n00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.178\nLet's try another selection.\n\n356\n00:17:09.688 --> 00:17:11.510\nIt works pretty well with this pepper.\n\n357\n00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:15.720\nNow here you'll notice I clicked, but\nit didn't select the whole thing.\n\n358\n00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:19.120\nThe reason why is cuz there\nwas enough color variation.\n\n359\n00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.160\nSo I'm going to change the size\nof my quick selection tool.\n\n360\n00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.390\nIt works just like a brush or\nany other sizing element in Photoshop.\n\n361\n00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:29.522\nI can just use my bracket tools\nto make it larger or smaller.\n\n362\n00:17:29.522 --> 00:17:34.260\nSo, I'm going to use my left bracket\nto make my selection tool smaller.\n\n363\n00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.447\nAnd I'm just gonna kinda\nsingle click along here.\n\n364\n00:17:37.862 --> 00:17:39.720\nAnd there we have it selected.\n\n365\n00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.860\nNow I don't know if you can tell but\nwe have a little extra piece here.\n\n366\n00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.290\nSo if we were to cut out this pepper,\nwe would have some white background,\n\n367\n00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.120\nwhich is not what we want at all.\n\n368\n00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.790\nSo we need to subtract that selection.\n\n369\n00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:56.190\nSo just like our add and subtract\nwere there with the Marquee tools,\n\n370\n00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.240\nit's still there with your\nQuick Selection tool.\n\n371\n00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.440\nSo up at the top you'll\nsee we have this minus.\n\n372\n00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.320\nSo that is your subtract from selection.\n\n373\n00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.530\nIf we select that, you can click\nright here on the white part and\n\n374\n00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:12.810\nrefine your edge more than\nwhat it was all ready.\n\n375\n00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:13.310\n>> Wow.\nVery nice.\n\n376\n00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.770\n>> Then you can go back to your plus sign.\n\n377\n00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:23.366\nOkay, if you want to switch between\nthe two, the keyboard shortcut is Alt or\n\n378\n00:18:23.366 --> 00:18:23.923\nOption.\n\n379\n00:18:26.025 --> 00:18:28.570\nOkay, so now we have our peppers selected.\n\n380\n00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:31.300\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm actually\ngoing to copy all of these guys.\n\n381\n00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.919\nAnd I'm going to paste them into\na new layer and call them peppers.\n\n382\n00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.960\nSo now if we were to hide\nthe visibility of layer zero\n\n383\n00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.410\nnow we just have our\nnice clean peppers here.\n\n384\n00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.219\n>> Very cool.\n\n385\n00:18:46.219 --> 00:18:49.550\n>> Okay, so now we need to come\nback over to our mushrooms.\n\n386\n00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:52.450\nSo our mushrooms we're gonna try out\nwith this quick selection tool as well.\n\n387\n00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:57.407\nSo make sure that you have your plus sign\non so you can check that up at the top.\n\n388\n00:18:57.407 --> 00:18:59.553\nAll right, so I'm going to click, click,\n\n389\n00:18:59.553 --> 00:19:02.120\nand this one did a pretty\ngood job of selecting.\n\n390\n00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.094\nLet's try this one as well.\n\n391\n00:19:04.917 --> 00:19:05.510\nPretty good.\n\n392\n00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:09.270\nAnd then this one is probably gonna\nbe a little bit more challenging.\n\n393\n00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.630\nSo we're gonna have to take\nthis a few clicks at a time.\n\n394\n00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:15.210\nSo you can either single-click or\nyou can click, hold, and drag as well.\n\n395\n00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:21.100\nSo whatever you prefer,\nit's completely up to you.\n\n396\n00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.530\nOkay, so it didn't get all of my mushroom.\n\n397\n00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.770\nI'm gonna zoom in so you can really\nsee where it didn't get the mushroom.\n\n398\n00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:30.870\nAnd it's right here so I need to add\nto the selection, but I added too much.\n\n399\n00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:35.040\nReason why is cuz my little\nradius is too large,\n\n400\n00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.990\nso the brush type part is too large.\n\n401\n00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.910\nSo let's make it smaller.\n\n402\n00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:43.253\nAnd let's click our Alt or Option and\nreally kinda smooth it out around here.\n\n403\n00:19:50.614 --> 00:19:52.230\nOkay, so I'm gonna do the same thing.\n\n404\n00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.060\nLet's copy, paste these.\n\n405\n00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:54.977\nNow we have mushrooms.\n\n406\n00:19:56.869 --> 00:20:00.020\nAnd we don't actually need layer zero\nanymore, so I'm just gonna hide it.\n\n407\n00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:04.300\nNow we have ingredients that are cut out,\nthey're on a transparent background.\n\n408\n00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:08.550\nSo if we were to save this as a .PNG\nit would have a transparent background.\n\n409\n00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:11.520\nWhich means you wouldn't have to cut out\nthe white, you've already done that step.\n\n410\n00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.020\n>> Very nice.\n\n411\n00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.960\n>> Yeah.\n\n412\n00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.240\nSo another form of selections\nis using the Pen tool.\n\n413\n00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.990\nSo you might be familiar with\nthe Pen tool if you've ever used\n\n414\n00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.310\nIllustrator before cuz\nit's a pen based program.\n\n415\n00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:27.130\nSo what we're gonna do we're gonna\nselect the Pen tool over on the left.\n\n416\n00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:32.520\nAnd I'm just going to kind\nof single click around here\n\n417\n00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:37.310\nsingle click, and single click.\n\n418\n00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.720\nNow with the Pen tool, if you click and\n\n419\n00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:44.260\nhold down on one of your points, you'll\nhave these little barbells that come up.\n\n420\n00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.680\nThese barbells allow you\nto create curvature.\n\n421\n00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.750\nSo I'm gonna zoom in a little bit so\nyou can see that.\n\n422\n00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.330\nSo there,\nnow you have a curvature of your line.\n\n423\n00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.810\nI'm going to keep selecting here.\n\n424\n00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.830\nThis part is pretty straight so\nit's not too, too bad.\n\n425\n00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.190\nYou can just keep going around.\n\n426\n00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:05.220\nNow again,\nthe Pen tool's what you'd wanna do for\n\n427\n00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:09.980\nmore specific,\nreally close type selections.\n\n428\n00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.590\n>> It's just a little tedious.\n\n429\n00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.250\n>> It is a little tedious,\nnot the preferred method but\n\n430\n00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.190\nit is another way to select.\n\n431\n00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.110\nIt's something that you might use\nif you are doing really close,\n\n432\n00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:20.800\nrefined selections.\n\n433\n00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.972\nSo I'm just going to quickly hurry\nthis guy up, and kinda show you.\n\n434\n00:21:24.972 --> 00:21:26.900\nI'm not gonna make it too exact,\nso that way.\n\n435\n00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.430\nSo we're not using this\npart of the pepper.\n\n436\n00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.503\n>> So you see where a little bit of\npractice to kinda guide you, and\n\n437\n00:21:33.503 --> 00:21:36.480\nlike you now exactly where you wanna\nclick, and which one you want to curve, so\n\n438\n00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.850\nthat's just gonna take a little practice.\n\n439\n00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.030\n>> It does take some practice, and\n\n440\n00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.730\nyou'll be better at it if you\nhave used Illustrator before.\n\n441\n00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:47.039\nThere are benefits to learning\nother Adobe programs.\n\n442\n00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.040\nNow you'll notice we\nhave this anchor point,\n\n443\n00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.500\nthis little circle again, that's telling\nus that we can close our selection.\n\n444\n00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.970\nSo if you single-click,\nit doesn't have those dotted lines.\n\n445\n00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.020\nWe need to give it those dotted lines.\n\n446\n00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.930\nSo you'll notice up at the top\nyou'll have a word that says Make.\n\n447\n00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:05.370\nRight next to Make you'll have\nthat option to make a selection.\n\n448\n00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.370\nSo if you click on Selection.\n\n449\n00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:12.370\nYou can either create a new selection,\nadd to an existing selection, subtract.\n\n450\n00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:16.140\nIt's those same kind of options that\nyou had with your Marquee tools.\n\n451\n00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.290\nI'm going to create a new selection.\n\n452\n00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:19.870\nAnd I'm going to go ahead and click OK.\n\n453\n00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:22.970\nAnd now we have our dotted lines,\njust like we did with everything else.\n\n454\n00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:24.620\n>> Very good.\n\n455\n00:22:25.878 --> 00:22:29.440\nAll right Kara,\nagain a great look at Photoshop and\n\n456\n00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.130\nall the different selection tools that\nwe have available within Photoshop.\n\n457\n00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:34.750\nImportant that we understand them.\n\n458\n00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:37.640\nObviously selecting is going to be\nan important part of working with\n\n459\n00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.670\nour document.\n\n460\n00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:42.240\nThanks for that great look, I think we\nhave a good idea now about how can go\n\n461\n00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.890\nabout using the different tools to make\nour selections, so thank you for that.\n\n462\n00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:47.630\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n463\n00:22:47.630 -->

--> 00:00:22.020\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're going over Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.260\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.580\nwe're going to be doing one\nof our try it out exercises.\n\n6\n00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.130\nSo here to walk us through is Ms.\nKara Page.\n\n7\n00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.020\nHow's it going, Kara?\n\n8\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.850\n>> I'm great, how are you?\n\n9\n00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.540\n>> Good, thanks.\n\n10\n00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.240\nSo what have you got lined up for\nus today?\n\n11\n00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.240\n>> Today we're going to be\nmaking a burger, actually.\n\n12\n00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.959\nSo I hope that you've eaten dinner.\n\n13\n00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:40.260\n[LAUGH] Or lunch, depending on\nwhat time of day it is for you.\n\n14\n00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.070\nSo let's go ahead and get started.\n\n15\n00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.710\nThe first thing that you\nare going to do on your end,\n\n16\n00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.050\nis locate these try it out\nlayers exercise files.\n\n17\n00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.170\nOkay, they're all image files for\nyou they're the same as what I'm gonna\n\n18\n00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.430\nbe doing so we're going to be walking\nstep by step through them together.\n\n19\n00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.230\n>> Fantastic.\n>> Okay so let's go ahead and\n\n20\n00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.010\nopen Photoshop.\n\n21\n00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.500\nSo I went ahead and\nopened this burger picture,\n\n22\n00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.420\nbut just in case you forget how\nto open I'm gonna show you.\n\n23\n00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.884\nSo we're gonna go to this open button.\n\n24\n00:01:07.884 --> 00:01:10.282\nAnd here we have burger.jpg, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:10.282 --> 00:01:15.630\nYou can go ahead and click, Open, and\nthere we are in the same place together.\n\n26\n00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.920\nYou'll notice that my layers\npanel looks different now.\n\n27\n00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.600\nIt's not on the bottom right corner.\n\n28\n00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.750\nThe reason why I did that is because\nI added it from my Windows menu.\n\n29\n00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.330\nI added the panel and\nI dragged it up to the very top so\n\n30\n00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.790\nthat why I have a fly out menu\nwhen I click on it instead.\n\n31\n00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.840\nIt's completely up to you if you\nlike looking at it this way.\n\n32\n00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.560\nIt's sometimes easier if\nyou have a lot of layers so\n\n33\n00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.890\nthat way you don't have to\nkeep scrolling up and down.\n\n34\n00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.240\n>> Very good.\n\n35\n00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.620\n>> Okay, so we have our burger.\n\n36\n00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.310\nThat's the first thing\nwe're starting out with.\n\n37\n00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.800\nAnd hopefully you remember how to unlock\nour burger, so we can actually edit it.\n\n38\n00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.820\nIf you don't, we're gonna do it right now.\n\n39\n00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.470\nSo let's go ahead and\nclick that unlock button.\n\n40\n00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.060\nAnd I'm going to rename my layer,\nby double clicking.\n\n41\n00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.830\nAnd I'm going to name this burger.\n\n42\n00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.000\nSo we have one layer, we're good to go.\n\n43\n00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.540\nWe're ready to start adding ingredients.\n\n44\n00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.120\n>> I like it.\n\n45\n00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.750\nThat's a good looking burger, but\nI think we can do better, right?\n\n46\n00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.460\n>> I think we can.\nYes.\n\n47\n00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.600\n>> All right.\n\n48\n00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.280\nAll right, so what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna click on our new\n\n49\n00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.460\nlayer icon button on the bottom,\nagain it's that sticky not looking thing.\n\n50\n00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.900\nAnd now we have layer one.\n\n51\n00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.760\nWe are going to rename this layer one,\nketchup.\n\n52\n00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.520\nOkay, so there we are,\nketchup, good to go.\n\n53\n00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.640\nIt's empty again, it's the little\ncheckerboard, it means it's transparent.\n\n54\n00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.330\nSo now we're going to select our brush.\n\n55\n00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.990\nSo you can select your brush\nover here on the left.\n\n56\n00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.080\nAnd I'm, I've got mine at 14,\n\n57\n00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.270\nyou can have it at whatever size you want,\nagain it doesn't matter.\n\n58\n00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.502\nIt also depends on if you\nlike a lot of ketchup or not.\n\n59\n00:02:41.502 --> 00:02:42.370\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I was gonna say,\n\n60\n00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.862\nhow much ketchup do you really want?\n\n61\n00:02:43.862 --> 00:02:44.680\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n62\n00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.180\nSo I'm going to change my color down\nhere on this bottom set foreground.\n\n63\n00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.460\nI'm going to change it\nto a nice ketchup red.\n\n64\n00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.319\n>> I like it.\n\n65\n00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.450\n>> Okay.\n\n66\n00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.600\nSo now that we are in our layer,\nmake sure that it does say ketchup.\n\n67\n00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.770\nThat's one highlighted.\n\n68\n00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.350\nI'm gonna go ahead and just kind of\ndraw some ketchup on this burger.\n\n69\n00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.260\nSo I have one of those little single\n\n70\n00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.015\nserve packets that's really\nhard to get the ketchup out of.\n\n71\n00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:11.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n72\n00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.620\nif you want your ketchup to\nbe a larger stream you just\n\n73\n00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.290\nchange the size of your brush, okay?\n\n74\n00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.250\nSo now we have ketchup,\nif we wanted to remove the ketchup,\n\n75\n00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.300\nmaybe we have a picky eater,\nwe can click on this Visibility icon.\n\n76\n00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.910\nAnd then we're back to our burger.\n\n77\n00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:27.410\n>> Very good.\n\n78\n00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.980\n>> Okay, let's go ahead and\nadd another condiment.\n\n79\n00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.810\nSo I'm going to click on\nthe Create New Layer.\n\n80\n00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.010\nAnd I'm going to name this one mustard.\n\n81\n00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.990\n>> Can't have a good\nburger without mustard.\n\n82\n00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.840\nRight now, mustard isn't my personal\nfavorite, it's kinda funny that I\n\n83\n00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.790\nchoose a burger, because I only\nlike burger and cheese, that's it.\n\n84\n00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.460\n>> Wow, okay.\n\n85\n00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.710\n>> So I'm going out of my comfort zone\nby making you a gourmet burger today.\n\n86\n00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.460\n>> We appreciate that.\n\n87\n00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.130\n>> all right,\n\n88\n00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.240\nlet's go to our brush again and I'm gonna\npretend that we really like mustard.\n\n89\n00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.230\nSo I'm going to make my brush\na little bit larger than it was.\n\n90\n00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.390\nAnd I need to pick a nice\nmustard yellow from over here.\n\n91\n00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.920\nIf picking a color makes you\na little bit nervous, don't worry,\n\n92\n00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.900\nwe are going to be going\nover that in the future.\n\n93\n00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.470\nOkay, so\n\n94\n00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.710\nI'm gonna make sure I'm on my mustard\nlayer, cuz if I'm not, watch what happens.\n\n95\n00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.820\nI'm gonna pretend that we're on ketchup,\nI'm going to draw on ketchup.\n\n96\n00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.810\nAnd now it's the same layer.\n\n97\n00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.820\nSo if I hit my Visibility icon,\nI lose my mustard as well.\n\n98\n00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.710\nSo we don't want that.\n\n99\n00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.800\nI'm going to undo what I just\ndid by hitting Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z.\n\n100\n00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.560\n>> So very important to make sure\nyou know what layer you're on,\n\n101\n00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.220\nbefore you start making changes.\n\n102\n00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.720\n>> Exactly.\n>> Okay.\n\n103\n00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.880\nLet's go ahead and click on mustard so\nwe know where we are.\n\n104\n00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.880\nAnd I'm just gonna do a nice little\nzig zag of mustard on there.\n\n105\n00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.630\n>> Beautiful.\n\n106\n00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.440\n>> Okay?\n\n107\n00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.840\nLet's say I accidentally went beyond, so\nI missed the burger, now it doesn't look\n\n108\n00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.090\nlike a real burger anymore, we have\nan issue, I need to erase that mustard.\n\n109\n00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.000\nSo you're gonna select the Eraser tool.\n\n110\n00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.750\nOver here on the left.\n\n111\n00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.120\nAnd I'm just going to erase this.\n\n112\n00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.920\nNow you'll notice it's\nnot erasing the burger.\n\n113\n00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.500\nThe reason why is because\nthe burger is on a different layer.\n\n114\n00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.570\nSo again, this is where layers become\nreally important in Photoshop.\n\n115\n00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.290\n>> Very good.\n\n116\n00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.550\n>> So now we have some ketchup,\nwe have some mustard.\n\n117\n00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.020\nIt's time to add some other ingredients.\n\n118\n00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.300\nSo find your layers, or your pictures for\n\n119\n00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.050\nthese layers, and I'm going to go\nahead and add our first ingredients.\n\n120\n00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.090\nSo I'm gonna go to File and\nPlace Embedded, remember,\n\n121\n00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.730\nthat's something you've learned before.\n\n122\n00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.420\nAnd I am going to do our onion next,\nso it's onion.png.\n\n123\n00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.890\nThe reason why these are PNG files,\nis because they are transparent.\n\n124\n00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.580\nSo you don't have to cut anything out,\nthat's going to be our next lesson.\n\n125\n00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.760\nLet's go ahead and hit Place.\n\n126\n00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.620\nAnd we have our onion.\n\n127\n00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.230\nNow you'll see, this onion is huge, it's\nbigger than our little mini slider, so\n\n128\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.710\nwe need to adjust the size of our onion.\n\n129\n00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.570\nYou have learned how to adjust\nthe size before, but as a refresher,\n\n130\n00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.240\nyou're going to click on the corner,\nhold down shift and drag.\n\n131\n00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.770\nThat will maintain\nthe proportions properly.\n\n132\n00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.170\nAnd I'm gonna move this onion over.\n\n133\n00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.380\nAnd I'm gonna hit enter\nto commit my change.\n\n134\n00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.980\n>> Much better.\n\n135\n00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.100\n>> So now I have one onion,\n\n136\n00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.830\nwhich kind of looks silly to only\nhave one onion on your burger.\n\n137\n00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.480\nSo we need to duplicate this layer.\n\n138\n00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.010\nSo we can do it a number of\ndifferent ways, like I said.\n\n139\n00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.310\nBut let's go ahead and\ndo it the first way that I showed you,\n\n140\n00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.210\nwhich is by right clicking and\nduplicating layer.\n\n141\n00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.000\nAnd I'm going to name this one onion 2.\n\n142\n00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.230\nSo now we have two onion layers.\n\n143\n00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.140\nBut again, you can't tell that the second\nonion's there because it layers on top\n\n144\n00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.250\nof the first one.\n\n145\n00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.760\nSo let's get our move tool and\nlet's move this onion over.\n\n146\n00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.640\nAnd I don't want my onion to look\n\n147\n00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.540\nexactly the same way because we\njust threw the onions on there.\n\n148\n00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.580\nThis isn't very accurate\nif you have it like this.\n\n149\n00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.550\nSo I'm going to just rotate,\nwhich we have learned before.\n\n150\n00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.160\nSo I'm just gonna rotate you around.\n\n151\n00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.030\nAnd go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n152\n00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.160\n>> Nice.\n\n153\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.890\n>> So let's say that I wanted\nto copy both of these layers.\n\n154\n00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.850\nWhat you could do, is you could select\nboth layers by clicking on Shift and\n\n155\n00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:06.430\nselecting both.\n\n156\n00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.390\nAnd you can right click and\nduplicate layers.\n\n157\n00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.360\nSo now you have two to duplicate.\n\n158\n00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.870\nOkay.\n\n159\n00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.425\nAnd now you'll see I have\nall these copies of onions.\n\n160\n00:07:17.425 --> 00:07:18.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I have.\n\n161\n00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.120\nHere we go.\nAnd again,\n\n162\n00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.160\nI can't see my other two onions.\n\n163\n00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.020\nSo let's go ahead and\nclick on onion two copy.\n\n164\n00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.020\nI'm going to move him off, and\n\n165\n00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.500\nI'm going to click on my other\nonion copy and move him.\n\n166\n00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.810\nSo let's say that I wanted\nto move my first onion.\n\n167\n00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.740\nI don't like the placement of it and\nI go to move it.\n\n168\n00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.970\nSo I go to click on it.\n\n169\n00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.970\nI click on it and\nit's only moving my other onion.\n\n170\n00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.740\nThe reason why, is because you have to be\non the specific layer in order to move it.\n\n171\n00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.390\nOkay so I'm going to select on my\noriginal onion layer and there you go.\n\n172\n00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.790\nNow we can move it.\n\n173\n00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.460\nNow if you feel more\ncomfortable with Photoshop, and\n\n174\n00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.880\nyou wanna turn on an option called\nAutoselect, you certainly can.\n\n175\n00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.072\nIt's in the top-left corner of your\nPhotoshop window when you have the move\n\n176\n00:08:02.072 --> 00:08:02.630\ntool on.\n\n177\n00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:08.580\nSo I can select Autoselect, and it will\nlet me just click willy-nilly in here.\n\n178\n00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.570\nAnd I can see your layers changing in\nyour panel over there as you click.\n\n179\n00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.720\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n180\n00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.010\nNow the problem with this auto select, is\nif you forget to lock some of your layers,\n\n181\n00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.620\nyou may accidentally\ngrab the burger instead.\n\n182\n00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.240\nAnd if we're dragging the burger\nthat's not exactly what we wanna do.\n\n183\n00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.120\nOkay?\n\n184\n00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.200\nSo now I have all these onions,\nI wanna put them in a group.\n\n185\n00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.460\nSo what we're going to do, is we're going\nto create a folder at the bottom, and\n\n186\n00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.130\nI'm going to name this guy onions,\nyou guessed it, right?\n\n187\n00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:42.410\nGonna drag it up to the top here, and I'm\ngonna put all my onions into this folder.\n\n188\n00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.570\nAgain, you can drag them one at a time.\n\n189\n00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:50.500\nOr, you can hold down shift,\nselect all of them and drag them up.\n\n190\n00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.680\nNow what might happen, let's say\nthat you have an overlapping onion.\n\n191\n00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:01.780\nSo let's have, one guy.\n\n192\n00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.730\noverlap, and\nyou really want this onion to overlap.\n\n193\n00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.310\nIf he, for some reason,\n\n194\n00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:12.320\ngets in the wrong order, he isn't\nnecessarily going to overlap anymore.\n\n195\n00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.330\nSo, let's see which onion that is.\n\n196\n00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.040\nSo the way that you can fix that,\n\n197\n00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.200\nis just by reordering your\nlayers in your layer folder.\n\n198\n00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.840\nSo if that ever happens to you,\ndon't panic.\n\n199\n00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.280\nIt's just layer order\nthat you need to adjust.\n\n200\n00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.030\n>> That's back to the stacking order we\ntalked about in the previous episode.\n\n201\n00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.330\n>> Exactly.\n>> Good.\n\n202\n00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.610\nOkay, so let's go ahead and\nadd another ingredient.\n\n203\n00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.790\nSo we're gonna go to File\n> Place embedded again.\n\n204\n00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.660\nAnd now we're going to add some spinach.\n\n205\n00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.230\nSo again, this is a fancy gourmet burger.\n\n206\n00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:44.050\nWe're not using just iceberg, we're using\nspinach so let's go ahead and place that.\n\n207\n00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.850\nAnd again our spinach is huge so\n\n208\n00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.040\nwe need to adjust the size by\nholding down shift and dragging.\n\n209\n00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:54.190\nAnd you'll notice,\nmy spinach is beneath everything now.\n\n210\n00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:58.440\nThe reason why that happened,\nis because it placed in a different order.\n\n211\n00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.150\nSo I want it to be on top of everything,\n\n212\n00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.800\nI'm going to drag it to\nthe top of my layers panel.\n\n213\n00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.480\nOkay?\n\n214\n00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.280\nBut I accidentally dragged it into\nmy onions, which might happen.\n\n215\n00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.310\nSo if that happens to you,\njust open up your folder.\n\n216\n00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.640\nAnd drag it out,\nbecause if we kept the spinach there, and\n\n217\n00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.820\nyou went to move the onions,\nyou would be moving the spinach, too.\n\n218\n00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.120\nOkay?\nSo, here we have our spinach.\n\n219\n00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.280\nAnd I'm going to add more spinach,\nbecause we just really like spinach.\n\n220\n00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.970\nSo, we're going to try\na different way of duplicating.\n\n221\n00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:34.280\nWe're going to click hold and\ndrag our layer The New Layer option.\n\n222\n00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.290\nAnd now we have a finished copy.\n\n223\n00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.000\nNow if you're not careful with the way\nthat you move your layers, you might\n\n224\n00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.990\nnotice that mine are now at the bottom,\nso just be careful with when you let go.\n\n225\n00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.930\nAnd we're going to drag these guys\nall the way up to the top again.\n\n226\n00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:51.850\nSo I'm gonna click on my spinach copy,\nI'm gonna turn off auto select,\n\n227\n00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:54.410\nso that way we can practice without it.\n\n228\n00:10:54.410 --> 00:11:00.150\nAnd I'm going to go ahead and\nresize these a bit and turn them.\n\n229\n00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.070\nOkay, so now we have two spinach copies.\n\n230\n00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.190\nNow you'll notice if you\nlook at the thumbnail for\n\n231\n00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:11.250\nthese layers, there's this little\nSmart Object icon in the corner.\n\n232\n00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.940\nIt kind of looks like overlapping boxes.\n\n233\n00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.720\nThe reason why that happened is because\n\n234\n00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.700\nthese were image files\nthat we placed in here.\n\n235\n00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.610\nSo in order to be edited\nfully in Photoshop,\n\n236\n00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.440\nyou have to do something\ncalled rastarizing them.\n\n237\n00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.430\nRastarizing a file is basically\nturning it into editable pixels.\n\n238\n00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.250\nSo let me demonstrate that for you.\n\n239\n00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:36.720\nLet's say that I wanted to I don't know,\nlet's say we are going to erase this.\n\n240\n00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.190\nYou will notice that when I\nhover over with the eraser,\n\n241\n00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.970\nwe have this little no symbol.\n\n242\n00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.650\nSaying sorry you can't do that.\n\n243\n00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.520\nIf you click, it will say smart object\nmust be rasterized before proceeding.\n\n244\n00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.140\nOkay, so\nif you don't nothing is going to happen.\n\n245\n00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:56.190\nThe way that you rasterized something\nis you right click on the layer name.\n\n246\n00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.430\nAnd then you'll notice about\nhalfway down your layers panel,\n\n247\n00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.130\nit's something called Rasterize Layer.\n\n248\n00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.530\nYou'll notice that our little\nsmart object icon disappeared, so\n\n249\n00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:11.710\nnow I can actually erase this\none piece of lettuce, if I want.\n\n250\n00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.367\nNow the reason why I didn't\nerase that top piece of spinach,\n\n251\n00:12:18.367 --> 00:12:21.530\nis because it's above\nthe other spinach layer.\n\n252\n00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.900\nEven though it is a same type of object,\n\n253\n00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.970\nthey are on different layers so\nyou only edit the object\n\n254\n00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.840\nwhen it is drawn as a [INAUDIBLE]\n>> You have to rasterize both of those\n\n255\n00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.980\nlayers individually.\n\n256\n00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.940\n>> Correct and\nbe on the proper layer as well, okay?\n\n257\n00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.220\nSo that's the concept of rasterization.\n\n258\n00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.490\nIt's something you might\ncome into contact with,\n\n259\n00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.810\nespecially the more you go to edit things.\n\n260\n00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.480\nSo if you're trying to cut\nthings out of backgrounds, or\n\n261\n00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.790\nadd layer style effects to them,\nyou might need to rasterize things first.\n\n262\n00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:50.830\nSo now we have our spinach.\n\n263\n00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:54.210\nLet's go ahead and add our last\ningredient, which is tomatoes.\n\n264\n00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.375\nWe're gonna do an open face sandwich,\nso, really gourmet here.\n\n265\n00:12:57.375 --> 00:12:58.153\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n266\n00:12:58.153 --> 00:12:59.040\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> All right.\n\n267\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.340\nLet's go ahead and place embedded.\n\n268\n00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.500\nAnd let's find our tomatoes and place.\n\n269\n00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:08.140\nSo again, let's resize these tomatoes,\nbecause they're big for\n\n270\n00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.920\nour little mini burger.\n\n271\n00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.660\nAnd I'm gonna place\nthem right on top here.\n\n272\n00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.160\n>> Hm.\n\n273\n00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.560\n>> Okay.\n\n274\n00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:21.270\nSo let's say that we wanted\nto merge all these layers.\n\n275\n00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:24.350\nAgain, you only merge if you\nwant to collapse everything,\n\n276\n00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.450\nso that means that you\ncan't edit them anymore.\n\n277\n00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.820\n>> So\nonce we're done we've gotta finalize, and\n\n278\n00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.100\nwe're getting ready to ship it off or\nuse it wherever.\n\n279\n00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.250\nThis might be our last step.\n\n280\n00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.260\nYes, so before we do that,\nlet's do one more type of duplication,\n\n281\n00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.640\njust to practice, and\nit's my favorite version.\n\n282\n00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.660\nWe're going to Alt-drag.\n\n283\n00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.800\nSo let's select our layer, and\nI'm going to Alt and drag above.\n\n284\n00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:50.120\nNow, the way that I Alt-dragged here is,\nI actually selected the layer name.\n\n285\n00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.260\nYou can either select the layer name and\nAlt and drag up, or\n\n286\n00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.540\nyou can select the actual\nimage part over in your.\n\n287\n00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.530\n>> Hm.\n>> In your image.\n\n288\n00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.880\nSo there we have two copies of the tomato.\n\n289\n00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.850\nAll right.\n\n290\n00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.650\nSo now let's say we\nreally like our burger.\n\n291\n00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:03.790\nIt's great.\n\n292\n00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:05.690\nAnd we've all ready saved a version of it.\n\n293\n00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.660\nSo let's go ahead and save it now.\n\n294\n00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.858\nI'm going to call this burger.psd.\n\n295\n00:14:09.858 --> 00:14:13.910\nAgain, the reason why we're calling it\na dot-psd is because we want to be able to\n\n296\n00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.160\nedit the contents in the future.\n\n297\n00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.100\nAnd it's the Photoshop document\nwhich means it saved your layers.\n\n298\n00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.520\nLet's go ahead and save that.\n\n299\n00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.880\nAgain you can maximize compatibility,\nthat's fine.\n\n300\n00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.710\nClick okay, and\nnow we need to flatten our layers.\n\n301\n00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:34.370\nSo let's right click, and\n\n302\n00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.299\nyou'll see that you can either\nmerge visible which we'll do first.\n\n303\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:43.450\nSo that merges all visible layers, so\nif you have anything, it will merge.\n\n304\n00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:47.470\nAnd then I undid that, so\nI can show you what it looks like.\n\n305\n00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.832\nNow we'll go ahead and right-click again.\n\n306\n00:14:49.832 --> 00:14:51.560\nAnd were going to flatten the image.\n\n307\n00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.920\nSo you'll notice that it's\na locked background icon.\n\n308\n00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.550\nSo it's just like when you first\nput an image into Photoshop,\n\n309\n00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.210\nso there you go, it's locked, and\n\n310\n00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:06.230\nnow if you want to save this, I'm gonna\ngo ahead and save this as a JPEG.\n\n311\n00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:10.896\nSo I'm gonna Save As,\nchange it from Photoshop in our drop\n\n312\n00:15:10.896 --> 00:15:15.483\ndown menu to a JPEG, and\nthen I'll go ahead and hit Save.\n\n313\n00:15:18.165 --> 00:15:20.010\nAnd there we go.\n\n314\n00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:20.640\nThere we have it.\n\n315\n00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.750\nThat is how to make a burger in Photoshop.\n\n316\n00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.020\n>> All right, well thanks for that, Kara.\n\n317\n00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.030\nThat was a lot of fun.\n\n318\n00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.250\nAnd I'm on my way to your house.\n\n319\n00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.970\nThat looks like a really good burger.\n\n320\n00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:31.260\nSo we're all hungry now.\n\n321\n00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:35.470\nHopefully everybody out there was as\nsuccessful as us at creating that burger.\n\n322\n00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:39.310\nGot to see all the really great techniques\nthat you taught us, tied together.\n\n323\n00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:41.190\nSo I hope you guy enjoyed that.\n\n324\n00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:44.200\nStay tuned for the next one,\nsigning off for now, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n325\n00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:44.904\n>> And I'm Kara Page.\n\n326\n00:15:44.904 --> 00:15:46.146\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n327\n00:15:46.146 -->

--> 00:00:21.562\nI'm your host Mike Roderick, and today\nwe're doing our Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:25.446\nAnd it's time for another one of\nthose exciting try it out exercises.\n\n5\n00:00:25.446 --> 00:00:27.505\nIn this one we're going\nto be doing selections.\n\n6\n00:00:27.505 --> 00:00:29.835\nAnd here to help us as always is Ms.\nKara Page.\n\n7\n00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:30.885\nHow's it going Kara?\n\n8\n00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:34.465\n>> I'm great, let's go ahead and\ndive in, start making that pizza.\n\n9\n00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:35.495\n>> All right.\n>> So go ahead and\n\n10\n00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:37.670\nlocate your pizza files.\n\n11\n00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.110\nOkay, so once you have those\nselected you'll be ready to start.\n\n12\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.940\nI'm going to go ahead and\nopen the pizza files.\n\n13\n00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.840\nLet's go to open.\n\n14\n00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.435\nAnd it's actually the crust.jpg,\nthis is the bottom layer of our pizza.\n\n15\n00:00:51.435 --> 00:00:52.810\n>> Gotta start a pizza with a good crust.\n\n16\n00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.640\n>> Yes, so you'll notice we have a crust,\nwe've got cheese, we have tomato sauce,\n\n17\n00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.320\nwe don't have any toppings though.\n\n18\n00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.840\nAnd we really need some toppings.\n\n19\n00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.350\n>> Absolutely.\n\n20\n00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.655\n>> It's kind of boring without it.\n\n21\n00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:04.245\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let's go ahead and\n\n22\n00:01:04.245 --> 00:01:08.200\nwe're going to go to File and I'm going\nto Open first, so let's go to Open.\n\n23\n00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.140\nAnd let's start with the spinach.\n\n24\n00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.230\nSo I'm going to click on spinach,\nclick Open.\n\n25\n00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.680\nAnd we have spinach in its own file now.\n\n26\n00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.820\nSo spinach has a white background, and\n\n27\n00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.120\nI showed you how to use the magic\nwand before, so let’s try that.\n\n28\n00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.558\nAnd this time were going to experiment\nwith different levels of tolerance.\n\n29\n00:01:26.558 --> 00:01:28.510\nSo it's single-click.\n\n30\n00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.240\nNow, the default is 32,\nthat's probably what yours is set at, and\n\n31\n00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.070\nyou'll notice that it does a really\nnice job of selecting just the spinach,\n\n32\n00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.040\nwhich is great.\n\n33\n00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.130\nBut let's see what were to happen if you\nhad something like our mushrooms file.\n\n34\n00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.980\nSo let's change the tolerance up to\nabout 200, and let's see what happens.\n\n35\n00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.000\nSo you'll notice it's starting\nto not be quite as refined.\n\n36\n00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.650\nThe reason why is because it's being\nmore or less specific with colors.\n\n37\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.540\nAnd let's-\n>> So the bigger number,\n\n38\n00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.890\nthe more forgiving it is, or the less\nexact it is on picking the colors?\n\n39\n00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.590\n>> Correct, that's how it works.\n\n40\n00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.900\nSo let's take it down to ten,\nand let's see what happens.\n\n41\n00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.334\nSo I'm going to deselect your Cmd or\nCtrl+D.\n\n42\n00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.840\nThis one does a very good job\nbecause it picks up those greens,\n\n43\n00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.560\nit knows what's going on.\n\n44\n00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.240\n>> So sometimes, depending on your image,\n\n45\n00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.810\nif you've gotta select between objects\nthat are similar in colors, Photoshop's\n\n46\n00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.090\nhaving a little bit of difficulty\ndifferentiating between the two.\n\n47\n00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.010\nWe can use that tolerance to help it out.\n\n48\n00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.430\n>> Precisely, so I'm going to undo that.\n\n49\n00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.650\nI'm gonna set it back to 32,\njust so I don't forget,\n\n50\n00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.010\nbecause we are going to be using\nit again in a later point.\n\n51\n00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.410\nSo now you'll notice we have\ndifferent options at the top.\n\n52\n00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.690\nSo if we take off Contiguous,\nlet's see what happens.\n\n53\n00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.510\nAnd let's just select part of our spinach.\n\n54\n00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.717\nSo you'll notice that it's selecting\nsimilar colors throughout our different\n\n55\n00:02:49.717 --> 00:02:50.526\nlayers of spinach.\n\n56\n00:02:50.526 --> 00:02:51.300\n>> But not just that one leaf, yeah.\n\n57\n00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.420\n>> But just not that one leaf.\n\n58\n00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.000\nSo let's turn on Contiguous.\n\n59\n00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.060\nAnd now it's just selecting your one leaf.\n\n60\n00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.080\n>> So it's looking at the color, but\nnow it say's it's gotta be touching.\n\n61\n00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.580\nVery good.\n\n62\n00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.610\n>> Okay, so\nnow that you kinda have a better feel for\n\n63\n00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.010\nthe magic wand tool, let's just\nselect these little spinach layers.\n\n64\n00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.620\nSo I'm going to click, and\n\n65\n00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.300\nI'm going to make sure that\nwe have our file ready to go.\n\n66\n00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.530\nSo I'm going to unlock, okay, so\ndon't forget to unlock your file.\n\n67\n00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.450\nI'm going to make\na transparent layer beneath,\n\n68\n00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.090\nand now make sure that you're on your\nspinach, and we're gonna hit Delete.\n\n69\n00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.543\nSo there we go,\nnow we don't have our white.\n\n70\n00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:35.100\nWe don't want those running ants anymore,\nso I'm gonna do Ctrl+D or Cmd+D.\n\n71\n00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.030\nSo you'll notice our spinach is on\na different file, we don't want that.\n\n72\n00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.810\nSo we need our spinach to be on our pizza.\n\n73\n00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.190\nWhat we're going to do is we're gonna\nclick on our Move tool, and and\n\n74\n00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.520\nwe are going to drag and\ndrop between files.\n\n75\n00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.960\nWe've learned how to do this before,\nbut now we're trying it in practice.\n\n76\n00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.470\nSo let's drag it over, and\ndrop it down on our pizza.\n\n77\n00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.360\n>> Voila.\n\n78\n00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.215\n>> So our spinach is big,\nI don't want it to be a salad pizza.\n\n79\n00:03:58.215 --> 00:03:58.886\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n80\n00:03:58.886 --> 00:04:03.416\nI'm going to make this\nconsiderably smaller.\n\n81\n00:04:03.416 --> 00:04:07.710\nSo now we have one group of spinach,\nbut we need more spinach.\n\n82\n00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.360\nSo we're going to duplicate our\nlayers which is something that we\n\n83\n00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.540\nrecently learned.\n\n84\n00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.300\nSo I'm going to use my favorite\nmethod which is the ALT method.\n\n85\n00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.850\nSo I'm going to click on ALT,\n\n86\n00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.630\nyou'll notice that you have\nthe double arrows come up.\n\n87\n00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.690\nAnd I'm going to click,\nhold and drag it over.\n\n88\n00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.010\nI'm going to kind of adjust this.\n\n89\n00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.390\nAnd we don't want all the spinach\nto look exactly the same, so\n\n90\n00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.720\nI'm just gonna keep Alt-dragging around,\nkind of adjust as needed.\n\n91\n00:04:36.206 --> 00:04:38.410\nAnd there,\nwe have an artistic looking spinach pizza.\n\n92\n00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.953\n>> Beautiful.\n>> So we're gonna combine some skills that\n\n93\n00:04:40.953 --> 00:04:42.066\nwe've learned.\n\n94\n00:04:42.066 --> 00:04:44.480\nNow we're going to group\nthe spinach together.\n\n95\n00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.400\nSo we're going to create a folder,\n\n96\n00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.730\nwe're going to name it spinach, and we're\ngoing to drag and drop our layers into it.\n\n97\n00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.520\nSo I'm gonna click on the first one,\nshift-click on the last one and\n\n98\n00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.620\ndrag all of our spinach layers\ninto our spinach folder.\n\n99\n00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.300\nSo now they're grouped.\n\n100\n00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.410\nSo there we go,\nnow our Layers panel is nice and neat.\n\n101\n00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.220\nSo spinach is taken care of,\nthat's good to go.\n\n102\n00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.380\nLet's add another ingredient.\n\n103\n00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.550\n>> What is next?\n\n104\n00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.650\n>> Well, let's find out,\nwe're gonna go to File.\n\n105\n00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.740\nAnd this time we're going\nto go to Place Embedded.\n\n106\n00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.390\nAnd let's go ahead and\ndo some more veggies.\n\n107\n00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.960\nSo we're going to place the veggies.\n\n108\n00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.830\nNow, this looks very familiar to us\nbecause we just played around with this.\n\n109\n00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.560\nNow, I just want to select our peppers.\n\n110\n00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.670\nOkay, I don't want the mushrooms,\nthat's not interesting to me, so\n\n111\n00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.160\nI'm just gonna use the peppers.\n\n112\n00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.100\nSo I'm gonna hit Enter, and\nI'm going to select these peppers.\n\n113\n00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.760\nNow, you can use any\nlasso tool that you want.\n\n114\n00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.530\nI'm going to use the magnetic lasso\ntool cuz it works pretty well for\n\n115\n00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.690\nthis, so\ngoing to click on my magnetic lasso tool.\n\n116\n00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.550\nAnd I'm going click, hold and\njust kinda drag it around.\n\n117\n00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.000\nRemember, if you need to\nforce Photoshop to click,\n\n118\n00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.950\nyou certainly can,\nyou just have to manually click.\n\n119\n00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.170\nSo drag it around.\n\n120\n00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.843\nI got into a corner, I'm going to click,\nI try to make that a good practice.\n\n121\n00:06:08.843 --> 00:06:11.744\nSo that way I tell Photoshop\nwhere the color is ending.\n\n122\n00:06:15.161 --> 00:06:16.775\nOkay.\n\n123\n00:06:16.775 --> 00:06:18.050\n>> You make it look so easy [LAUGH].\n\n124\n00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.000\n>> Well, with time,\nit will be easy for you as well.\n\n125\n00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.037\nOkay, so I'm gonna copy that and\nmake a new layer.\n\n126\n00:06:23.037 --> 00:06:27.658\nAnd I'm going to name this guy, pepper.\n\n127\n00:06:27.658 --> 00:06:30.220\nSo now we have a separate pepper,\nit's on its own,\n\n128\n00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.954\nwe can do whatever we want with it.\n\n129\n00:06:31.954 --> 00:06:34.430\nSo I can move it I can do whatever.\n\n130\n00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.115\nI'm going to select another pepper out\nof here, so let's go ahead and do that.\n\n131\n00:06:38.115 --> 00:06:45.576\nThis time I'm going to use our\nQuick Selection tool, so quick select.\n\n132\n00:06:45.576 --> 00:06:46.507\nAnd I need to make the brush bigger,\n\n133\n00:06:46.507 --> 00:06:49.150\nbecause right now it's really small cuz\nwe were zoomed in last time we used it.\n\n134\n00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.960\nSo I'm going to make it bigger by\nusing the right bracket this time.\n\n135\n00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.420\nSo I'm going to click, hold,\njust kinda drag it around.\n\n136\n00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.710\nBut you'll notice why isn't it staying?\n\n137\n00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.820\nThat's odd, isn't it?\n\n138\n00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.200\n>> Yeah, it is.\n>> Odd behavior.\n\n139\n00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.280\nThe reason why is because we're not on the\ncorrect layer, we're on our pepper layer.\n\n140\n00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.925\nSo if I wanted to select the pepper,\n\n141\n00:07:08.925 --> 00:07:12.660\nit'll do it with ease because\nthat's what layer we're on.\n\n142\n00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.325\nSo let's deselect that, and make sure\nto click on your veggies layer, okay.\n\n143\n00:07:17.325 --> 00:07:21.115\nPhotoshop's going to default to have the\nlast layer you were working with selected.\n\n144\n00:07:21.115 --> 00:07:22.795\nSo make sure to go back,\ngo back to your original.\n\n145\n00:07:22.795 --> 00:07:25.175\n>> If you're not paying attention,\neasy to get on the wrong layer.\n\n146\n00:07:25.175 --> 00:07:27.925\n>> Very, very, that's why it's\nhelpful to lock your layers and\n\n147\n00:07:27.925 --> 00:07:29.835\nhide your layers as well.\n\n148\n00:07:29.835 --> 00:07:32.115\nIt's all coming full circle now.\n\n149\n00:07:32.115 --> 00:07:34.025\nAll right, I'm going to click,\nhold and drag.\n\n150\n00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.030\nAnd it looks like I need to do\nsome refinements here because it\n\n151\n00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.950\ndidn't catch exactly what\nI wanted from the pepper.\n\n152\n00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.620\nSo I need to deselect part of that.\n\n153\n00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.950\nSo what I'm going to do,\nI'm going to click Alt or Option.\n\n154\n00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.650\nIt changed it to the little minus symbol.\n\n155\n00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.200\nAnd then you can really\nclean up your selection by\n\n156\n00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.040\njust kind of dragging along here.\n\n157\n00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.760\nOkay, so\nnow you have this pepper selected.\n\n158\n00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.870\nSo I'm going to Copy, paste it into a new\nlayer and I'm gonna call this guy pepper2.\n\n159\n00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.990\nSo now we have two peppers and\nthat's really all I want.\n\n160\n00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.120\nI don't really want this\nveggies file any more, so\n\n161\n00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.635\nI can either hide it, or I can drag it\ndown to the trash can to delete it,\n\n162\n00:08:18.635 --> 00:08:24.640\nright-click and delete it, or\nI can just delete it when it's selected.\n\n163\n00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.740\nSo completely up to you\nhow you want to do that.\n\n164\n00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.300\nBut now you saw how we actually cut\nsomething out of a document, and\n\n165\n00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.745\nwe only saved the parts that we needed.\n\n166\n00:08:31.745 --> 00:08:33.266\n>> Perfect.\n\n167\n00:08:33.266 --> 00:08:34.775\n>> So\nnow we have our two different peppers.\n\n168\n00:08:34.775 --> 00:08:38.107\nNow these peppers are a little bit large,\nso\n\n169\n00:08:38.107 --> 00:08:41.720\nI'm gonna resize them and\ndrag them over here.\n\n170\n00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:47.730\nWe can do the same thing with pepper2,\nso click on that and resize.\n\n171\n00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.290\nRemember to hold down Shift or\n\n172\n00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.820\nelse it's not going to constrain\nyour proportions properly.\n\n173\n00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.730\nSo now I've got these two peppers.\n\n174\n00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.390\nIf I wanted to make more peppers,\nI certainly could.\n\n175\n00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.350\nYou could either select both and\nthen duplicate them,\n\n176\n00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.250\nyou could turn on auto select,\nand duplicate them that way.\n\n177\n00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.570\nSo let me show you that.\n\n178\n00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.240\nSo we're gonna turn on auto select again,\nit's in the top left corner.\n\n179\n00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:14.640\nAnd I'm going to Shift and\nclick on the other item I want to select.\n\n180\n00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.330\nSo it's very similar to how you do it in\nthe layers panel, and you'll notice if you\n\n181\n00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:21.290\nlook at the layers panel,\nboth of the peppers are selected now.\n\n182\n00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:25.640\nSo I'm going to click on Alt,\nagain your double arrow pops up, and\n\n183\n00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.970\nI'm going to drag this out.\n\n184\n00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.340\nThis one I'm going to make\na little bit smaller, therefore,\n\n185\n00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.602\nmaybe a different part of the pepper.\n\n186\n00:09:32.602 --> 00:09:36.080\nThen we have more peppers,\n\n187\n00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.610\nyou can make as many peppers as you'd\nlike, it's completely up to you.\n\n188\n00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:40.680\nI'm going to do another set.\n\n189\n00:09:43.885 --> 00:09:49.495\nAnd let's say that I don't like where\nthis top little pepper guy is placed,\n\n190\n00:09:49.495 --> 00:09:52.660\nif I wanted to, I could move him.\n\n191\n00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.750\nOr I could select him and cut him out, or\n\n192\n00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.300\nI could erase him and cut him out,\nbecause he's on his own layer.\n\n193\n00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.930\nOkay, so let's do that.\n\n194\n00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.440\nAnd since I'm not really liking this one,\n\n195\n00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.385\nI'm not a big fan of peppers,\nI'm just gonna delete it.\n\n196\n00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.630\nOkay, there we go.\n\n197\n00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.710\nSo now we have some\ningredients on our pizza.\n\n198\n00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.450\nBut right now we have a vegetarian pizza.\n\n199\n00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.360\n>> Yes, we do.\n>> I personally like meat on my pizza, so\n\n200\n00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.110\nwe're gonna add some.\n\n201\n00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:16.971\n>> Thank goodness,\nI was getting worried [LAUGH].\n\n202\n00:10:16.971 --> 00:10:20.260\n>> [LAUGH] So let's go to File > Open.\n\n203\n00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.892\nAnd open your meats.jpg.\n\n204\n00:10:22.892 --> 00:10:23.700\nOkay.\n>> There we go.\n\n205\n00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.170\n>> So here we have some sausage and\nsome pepperoni.\n\n206\n00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.480\nSo we're going to practice some\ndifferent selections this way.\n\n207\n00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.790\nThe first thing we're going to try\nout is our rectangular marquee tool.\n\n208\n00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.010\nSo it's up at the top of your menu.\n\n209\n00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:41.690\nIt's probably hidden\nunder the single row or\n\n210\n00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.650\nsingle column,\nif that's what you used last.\n\n211\n00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:49.120\nAnd what this does is it\njust allows me to say, okay,\n\n212\n00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.970\nthis is what I'm gonna be working on.\n\n213\n00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.590\nThis is great for me.\n\n214\n00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.610\nI'm just gonna copy, paste it again.\n\n215\n00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.850\nNow, it has the white background\nwhich isn't ideal, so\n\n216\n00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:02.670\nwhat we need to do is we need\nto delete that white background.\n\n217\n00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.850\nSo you could do it a number\nof different ways.\n\n218\n00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.690\nWe could use our quick selection tool.\n\n219\n00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.280\nWe can use our magic wand tool.\n\n220\n00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.250\nSo let's see what would happen.\n\n221\n00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.540\nSo you'll notice when I selected the magic\nwand tool on just this little sausage\n\n222\n00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.400\nlayer, it's only selecting the white\nfrom that particular layer,\n\n223\n00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.520\nnot the entire document.\n\n224\n00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.120\nOkay, so I'm gonna delete that.\n\n225\n00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.167\nI'm gonna deselect, and\nnow we have just our sausage.\n\n226\n00:11:27.167 --> 00:11:30.625\nI'm sure you're wondering, well,\nhow do I know if it's just the sausage.\n\n227\n00:11:30.625 --> 00:11:32.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What you need to do is you need to\n\n228\n00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.100\nadd a transparent layer behind it.\n\n229\n00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.510\nLet's go ahead and\nhide our background layer.\n\n230\n00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.400\n>> There we go.\n\n231\n00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.420\n>> And there it is, so we don't\nreally need that transparent layer.\n\n232\n00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:42.950\nNow, we have our sausage layer.\n\n233\n00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:46.090\nAnd I'm going to click, hold and\ndrag it over to the crust.\n\n234\n00:11:47.896 --> 00:11:49.310\nOkay, so there we go.\n\n235\n00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.090\nAnd, again, you can do the same\nthing where you make several.\n\n236\n00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.040\nYou can put them in folders.\n\n237\n00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.160\nYou can do whatever pleases you.\n\n238\n00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.459\nMake sure to hit Enter to\ncommit your move though.\n\n239\n00:12:01.459 --> 00:12:02.630\nSo I'm just gonna ALT\ndrag a few of these guys.\n\n240\n00:12:10.825 --> 00:12:13.360\nAnd move that one over and there we go.\n\n241\n00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.000\nSo now we have some sausage.\n\n242\n00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.730\nBut our layers panel is\nreally disorganized now.\n\n243\n00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:22.250\nCuz it just says layer 2 copy 4,\nlayer 2 copy 2, that makes no sense to me,\n\n244\n00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.710\nI have no idea what that means.\n\n245\n00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:28.570\nSo I am going to go ahead and\nselect all of my layer twos and\n\n246\n00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:29.395\nI'm going to right-click.\n\n247\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:37.205\nAnd I am going to merge these layers.\n\n248\n00:12:37.205 --> 00:12:41.790\nSo now all of my sausage is on one layer.\n\n249\n00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.570\nSo we learned about merging before,\nbut outside of just merging\n\n250\n00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:50.510\nevery layer together, you can just\nmerge particular layers together.\n\n251\n00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.200\n>> Nice.\n\n252\n00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.650\n>> So now I'm going to rename this guy,\nSausage.\n\n253\n00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.500\nSo our peppers, if you wanted to do\nsomething to do them, let's say I wanted\n\n254\n00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.870\nto add a color code like we've learned\nabout before, you'd right-click.\n\n255\n00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.810\nAnd I'm going to make them green for\npepper.\n\n256\n00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.070\nSo, this is looking a little\nbit more organized.\n\n257\n00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.580\nIf I wanted it to look even further\norganized, I could add a group for\n\n258\n00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.390\nthe peppers.\n\n259\n00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.610\nBut that's up to you.\n\n260\n00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.530\nOkay, so we have our sausage,\nnow we need our pepperoni.\n\n261\n00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:21.520\nSo let's go back to our meats file.\n\n262\n00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.950\nAnd we're going to use our ellipse\ntool to select the pepperoni.\n\n263\n00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:29.070\nSo again the ellipse is hidden\nunder the rectangular marking tool.\n\n264\n00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.440\nYou go ahead and select it.\n\n265\n00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.760\nAnd if you hold down Shift as you drag,\nyou'll create a perfect circle.\n\n266\n00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.770\nSo I need to move this.\n\n267\n00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.470\nIf you hover over it,\nyou'll see this little arrow come up.\n\n268\n00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:48.410\nThat's your direct selection arrow, it\nallows you to select just this selection.\n\n269\n00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.650\nIf you were to use your move tool,\nagain, you'd be cutting things out,\n\n270\n00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.280\nthat's not what you want to do.\n\n271\n00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.620\nSo here we have our selection, but\n\n272\n00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.260\nI didn't do the best job\nof grabbing this pepperoni.\n\n273\n00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.254\nSo I'm going undo that,\nI'm gonna do Ctrl+D.\n\n274\n00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.300\nI'm going to try selecting\nfrom a different way now.\n\n275\n00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:08.010\nI'm going to Alt drag, so\nlet's see what happens, Alt or Option.\n\n276\n00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.520\nSo click, hold and drag and\n\n277\n00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.340\nyou'll notice that my circle started\nat the center instead of the edge.\n\n278\n00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.690\nOkay, so if I wanted to move that over,\nthat'd be great.\n\n279\n00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.850\nNow my problem is, it looks like an oval,\nso that's not ideal.\n\n280\n00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:23.970\nSo how do I combine\nthe two things together?\n\n281\n00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.490\nI want it to be a perfect circle,\nI want to start from the middle.\n\n282\n00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.380\nYou probably guessed it, you hold down\nboth keys, you hold down the Alt and\n\n283\n00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.760\nyou hold down the Shift.\n\n284\n00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.110\nSo let's try that, so\nI'm gonna hold down Alt and\n\n285\n00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:38.260\nI'm gonna hold down Shift,\njust gonna carefully drag out here.\n\n286\n00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.180\nAnd don't let go like I did or\nelse you'll lose your selection.\n\n287\n00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:44.610\nThere you go.\n\n288\n00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.690\nKind of nudge it into place.\n\n289\n00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:50.140\nAnd then you can copy that,\nput it not on its own layer.\n\n290\n00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.230\nBut you noticed, what did I just do?\n\n291\n00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.970\nI just copied the sausage.\n\n292\n00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:54.777\n>> Oops.\n\n293\n00:14:54.777 --> 00:14:56.985\n>> Why do you think that happened,\ndo you have any idea?\n\n294\n00:14:56.985 --> 00:14:58.516\n>> Were we on the wrong\nlayer again [LAUGH].\n\n295\n00:14:58.516 --> 00:14:59.874\n>> We're on the wrong layer again.\n\n296\n00:14:59.874 --> 00:15:01.645\nSo, again, make sure that\nyou're on the correct layer.\n\n297\n00:15:01.645 --> 00:15:03.724\nSo Background, Copy.\n\n298\n00:15:03.724 --> 00:15:05.590\nWe're gonna paste it, and there we go.\n\n299\n00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.640\nNow we have our pepperoni.\n\n300\n00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:13.860\nSo we can drag him over now\nto the crust and let him go.\n\n301\n00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.510\nNow, you'll notice we have\nsome white around him.\n\n302\n00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:20.680\nSo we can use several different tools\nto really refine that selection.\n\n303\n00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.520\nWe can use our magic eraser tool,\nwe can use our quick selection tool.\n\n304\n00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.450\nSo let's just go ahead and\ntry the Quick Selection.\n\n305\n00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:29.210\nAgain, it's hidden\nunderneath your magic wand.\n\n306\n00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.510\nQuick Selection,\nmake sure you're on your pepperoni layer.\n\n307\n00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:38.180\nAnd that did a pretty good job\nof just selecting the pepperoni.\n\n308\n00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.894\nNow, watch what happens if I hit Delete,\nthough.\n\n309\n00:15:40.894 --> 00:15:42.190\n>> Oops.\n\n310\n00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.000\n>> I just got rid of my pepperoni.\n\n311\n00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.290\n>> And left the white you didn't want.\n\n312\n00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.615\n>> Exactly, that's not what I want, so\n\n313\n00:15:47.615 --> 00:15:50.895\nwhat we need to do is we need\nto inverse our selection.\n\n314\n00:15:50.895 --> 00:15:53.350\nSo I've mentioned that before,\nbut let me show you in practice.\n\n315\n00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:57.863\nSo let's undo what we just did,\nso I just CTRL+Z, or CMD+ Z.\n\n316\n00:15:57.863 --> 00:16:02.390\nWe're gonna go up to Select,\nand we're going to do Inverse.\n\n317\n00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.020\nNow, you'll notice our\nrunning ant selections\n\n318\n00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.330\nare around the entire document now.\n\n319\n00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.750\nSo we have them from edge to edge and\nit's on the edge of the pepperoni.\n\n320\n00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.350\nIf I were to click Delete now,\nnow our white's gone.\n\n321\n00:16:15.778 --> 00:16:20.860\nAnd let's deselect, and you can make as\nmany of these pepperonis as you want.\n\n322\n00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.260\nAgain, it's completely up to you.\n\n323\n00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:22.910\n>> Extra pepperoni, please.\n\n324\n00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.212\n>> You can put them in folders.\n\n325\n00:16:24.212 --> 00:16:26.681\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can do whatever you like with them.\n\n326\n00:16:26.681 --> 00:16:31.460\nBut this is essentially how to place your\ntoppings, duplicate them, group them,\n\n327\n00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:35.110\npretty much do all of the tools that\nwe've learned about so far in Photoshop.\n\n328\n00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.270\n>> Fantastic,\nI didn't know I was going to get so\n\n329\n00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.470\nhungry when I was learning Photoshop.\n\n330\n00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.998\nBut we thank you for that Kara,\ngreat demonstration on all those different\n\n331\n00:16:42.998 --> 00:16:46.500\nselection techniques that we can\nuse when working in Photoshop.\n\n332\n00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.040\nThank you for that.\n\n333\n00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.030\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n334\n00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.410\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n335\n00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.212\n>> And I'm Kara Page.\n\n336\n00:16:52.212 --> 00:16:53.373\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n337\n00:16:53.373 -->

00:00:18.970\nI'm your host Mike Roderick, and\ntoday we're doing Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.040\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be taking a look at brushes.\n\n5\n00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.750\nThat's not what you think, right, it's\nnot hair brushes, it's not paint brushes.\n\n6\n00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.400\nHere to clear that all up for\nus is Miss Kara Page, how you doing Kara?\n\n7\n00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.060\n>> I'm great.\n\n8\n00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.930\nYou ready to get started?\n\n9\n00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.940\n>> I am ready.\n\n10\n00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.225\n>> Okay, so today you're going\nto turn into a digital artist.\n\n11\n00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:40.889\nSo they are kind of paint brushes, but\n\n12\n00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:44.207\nthey are not the messy kind of paint\nbrushes that you are thinking of.\n\n13\n00:00:44.207 --> 00:00:45.853\n>> Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:45.853 --> 00:00:47.216\n>> All right so let's go ahead and\n\n15\n00:00:47.216 --> 00:00:49.375\nget started by opening up\njust a blank document.\n\n16\n00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:55.015\nSo I'm going to goto new,\nhopefully your Photoshop is up and\n\n17\n00:00:55.015 --> 00:00:58.620\ngoing, I'm just gonna\ngoto new six by four.\n\n18\n00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.710\nYeah, you can change that to six by four,\nyou can really use whatever document size\n\n19\n00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.540\nyou want, cuz we're just demonstrating\nwhat a brush does in Photoshop.\n\n20\n00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.840\nGonna go ahead and hit OK.\n\n21\n00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.460\nOkay, now we have our blank canvas.\n\n22\n00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.671\nLet me go ahead and\nkind of get rid of this timeline.\n\n23\n00:01:19.377 --> 00:01:20.170\nGive us a little more\nreal estate [INAUDIBLE]\n\n24\n00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.870\n>> Yes, there we go.\n\n25\n00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.060\nSo the timeline is a bit\nof a sneak peek and\n\n26\n00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.290\njust something you're going to be\nlearning in future animations.\n\n27\n00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.190\nSo I mentioned that before that you're\ngonna learn animation in Photoshop,\n\n28\n00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.910\nso that's what that panel looks like.\n\n29\n00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.930\nWe don't need it up all the time.\n\n30\n00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.290\nAll right, so\nnow we have our big blank canvas space.\n\n31\n00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.080\nLet's go ahead and get started.\n\n32\n00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.610\nSo we're going to learn about brushes.\n\n33\n00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.290\nSo we need to find the brush first.\n\n34\n00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.340\nWell, let's go ahead over to our\ntool panel over on the left.\n\n35\n00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.790\nThe brush looks identical\nto a physical paint brush.\n\n36\n00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.860\nIf you hover over it will say brush.\n\n37\n00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.000\nThe shortcut is the letter B.\n\n38\n00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.450\nSo I'm gonna click on brush.\n\n39\n00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.150\nNow if I were to just quickly draw across.\n\n40\n00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.880\nYou'll see there I have a brush stroke.\n\n41\n00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.170\nNow, there's nothing too exciting\nabout this particular brush stroke.\n\n42\n00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.440\nIt's just defaulted right now.\n\n43\n00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.760\nSo I'm going to undo what I just did\nby doing either command z or control z.\n\n44\n00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.250\nSo there,\nnow we have a blank canvas again.\n\n45\n00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.430\nIf you want to see brush options\nwhat you you can do is click\n\n46\n00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.630\nover where you see the number\nwith the dot above it.\n\n47\n00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.220\nOkay, that shows you your brush tip and\nit show you the size of your brush.\n\n48\n00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.930\nSo I'm going to click on that drop\ndown arrow right to the right.\n\n49\n00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.080\nOkay now that this is loaded you'll\nsee my brush size is 14 pixels,\n\n50\n00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.500\nmy hardness is at 100.\n\n51\n00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.720\nAnd then you'll see I have this little\ndiagram to the left right here.\n\n52\n00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.040\nThis diagram allows you to change\nthe roundness and diameter of your brush.\n\n53\n00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.020\nSo if you are more of a professional\nartist using Photoshop for\n\n54\n00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.160\nactual paintings,\n\n55\n00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.650\ndigital paintings, you're probably going\nto want to ingest those sizes yourself.\n\n56\n00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.630\nIf you're just you know, using\nbrushes here and there you're more of\n\n57\n00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.980\na casual user you probably won't be\nadjusting the diameter too often.\n\n58\n00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.610\nOkay.\n\n59\n00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.690\nSo let's talk about size or hardness,\nwhat these numbers even mean.\n\n60\n00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.510\nSo size, pretty easy to understand.\n\n61\n00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.960\nLet's show you what this\n14 pixel brush looks like.\n\n62\n00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.970\nI'm just gonna draw straight across You'll\nnotice my line wasn't exactly straight.\n\n63\n00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.610\nSo it's very hard to draw a straight\nline with a trackpad or a mouse.\n\n64\n00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.840\nSo what you can do in\nPhotoshop is if you click and\n\n65\n00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.490\nhold down Shift at the same time,\nit'll create a straight line, okay.\n\n66\n00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.410\nSo here I'm creating a zig-zag\npattern because it's picking up from\n\n67\n00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.070\nwhere I left off on the last line.\n\n68\n00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.290\nOkay, so this is our fourteen size brush.\n\n69\n00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.130\nI'm going to go up here and\nchange it to something much larger.\n\n70\n00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.430\nLet's change it to a hundred.\n\n71\n00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.580\nSo you'll notice that right now\nmine says one hundred and five.\n\n72\n00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.660\nNow if you use the slider it's harder to\nget exactly the number you're looking for.\n\n73\n00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.620\nYou can always type in\nthat number in photo shop.\n\n74\n00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.880\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and draw.\n\n75\n00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.070\nNow you can directly compare\na hundred size versus 14.\n\n76\n00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.710\nThere's a pretty big difference.\n\n77\n00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.820\nPhoto shop goes up to\nan extremely large number amount.\n\n78\n00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.740\nYou can do thousands and\nthousands of pixel size.\n\n79\n00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.680\nSo, let's show you what happens then.\n\n80\n00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.190\nSo, let's say that we do 5000 pixels.\n\n81\n00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.808\nAnd we just single click.\n\n82\n00:04:18.808 --> 00:04:19.795\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n83\n00:04:19.795 --> 00:04:22.860\n>> It's gonna fill our entire canvas.\n\n84\n00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.990\nWhich is great if you don't\nknow what the paint bucket is,\n\n85\n00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.695\nbut that's what the paint bucket is for.\n\n86\n00:04:26.695 --> 00:04:27.360\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> So\n\n87\n00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.770\nrealistically you're not gonna be\nusing 5,000 pixel brushes very often\n\n88\n00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.390\nunless you're doing huge canvases or\nmurals,\n\n89\n00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.290\nso I'm gonna bring this back\ndown to a reasonable size.\n\n90\n00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.130\nOkay?\nI'm gonna undo what we just did.\n\n91\n00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.450\nI'm gonna undo all the way\nback to a blank canvas so\n\n92\n00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.370\nwe have a starting point here again.\n\n93\n00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.850\nOkay.\nSo that is size.\n\n94\n00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.950\nNow let's talk about hardness.\n\n95\n00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.711\nRight now it's set at a hundred hardness,\n\n96\n00:04:51.711 --> 00:04:56.097\nso let's compare the two so\nI'm just going to draw a straight line.\n\n97\n00:04:56.097 --> 00:04:56.913\nOkay?\n\n98\n00:04:56.913 --> 00:05:01.054\nThis is at 100 hardness, so\nthe edges are very firm.\n\n99\n00:05:01.054 --> 00:05:03.294\nThere's no kind of\nwishy-washiness about them.\n\n100\n00:05:03.294 --> 00:05:10.168\nLet me show you what would happen\nif we change the hardness to 50%.\n\n101\n00:05:10.168 --> 00:05:12.139\nLet me zoom in so\nyou can actually see that.\n\n102\n00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.660\nIf you compare the two, you'll see\nthe 50% hardness is kinda fuzzy.\n\n103\n00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.430\n>> Yeah, that's what I was gonna say.\n\n104\n00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.580\nIt is a little fuzzy there.\n\n105\n00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.060\n>> It's a little fuzzy.\n\n106\n00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.210\nSo let's take this down even further.\n\n107\n00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.400\nSo let's go down to 25%,\nand let's compare again.\n\n108\n00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.675\nSo I'm gonna do that right under the 50.\n\n109\n00:05:28.675 --> 00:05:32.130\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n110\n00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.910\nOkay?\n\n111\n00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.540\nSo that is your hardness, now you might\nwant to adjust the hardness of your brush,\n\n112\n00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.770\nif let's say that you're creating\nsomething like spray painting.\n\n113\n00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.140\nSpray painting your not gonna want a hard,\n\n114\n00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.380\nedged brush because it's\nnot gonna look realistic.\n\n115\n00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.296\nSo you can adjust the hardness like that.\n\n116\n00:05:47.296 --> 00:05:49.251\n>> Very cool.\n\n117\n00:05:49.251 --> 00:05:51.390\n>> So I'm gonna zoom out for you.\n\n118\n00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.580\nSo the difference between the 50 and\n25 isn't as noticeable as the 100% and 25.\n\n119\n00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.180\nYou'll see as you\nexperiment with Photoshop.\n\n120\n00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.570\nPlaying around with the brushes, you'll\nfind the perfect sweet spot for you.\n\n121\n00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.730\nSo everything we've done so\nfar is using this same brush,\n\n122\n00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.470\nso what were to happen if we\npicked one of these other brushes?\n\n123\n00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:12.300\nSo let's see.\n\n124\n00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.110\nI'm going to pick this soft,\nround, pressure size brush.\n\n125\n00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.990\nIf I do that, you'll notice that the\nhardness automatically changed to zero.\n\n126\n00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.120\nThat's because this brush is already\nin here as what's called a preset.\n\n127\n00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.840\nPhotoshop already has preloaded\nbrushes in here for you.\n\n128\n00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.730\nThat way you don't have to\ncreate them from scratch.\n\n129\n00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.429\nSo let's just,\nI'm gonna draw a little smiley face.\n\n130\n00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.520\nThere we go.\nSo it has that low hardness so\n\n131\n00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.400\nthe edges aren't very firm and\nexact and precise.\n\n132\n00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.690\nOkay.\nLet's try another brush,\n\n133\n00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.450\nsomething that's a little bit more fun and\nartistic.\n\n134\n00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.940\nLet's try this brush right here.\n\n135\n00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.550\nSo if you hover over the brush,\nit'll tell you exactly what it is.\n\n136\n00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.810\nSo this is fan high bristle count.\n\n137\n00:06:54.352 --> 00:06:59.900\nSo if we paint like this, it looks\na little bit more like a real paintbrush.\n\n138\n00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.460\n>> Yeah, it almost gives you\na calligraphy effect there when you-\n\n139\n00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.010\n>> It really does, it really does.\n\n140\n00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.670\nPhotoshop actually works\nreally well with calligraphy.\n\n141\n00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.720\nThere's actually a set of\ncalligraphy brushes in\n\n142\n00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.450\nPhotoshop-\n>> Wow.\n\n143\n00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.380\n>> Preloaded.\n\n144\n00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.100\nSo let's go ahead and find those cuz\nthat's something I was gonna go over next.\n\n145\n00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.240\nSo in most of your expandable panels\nyou'll see this little gear type icon.\n\n146\n00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.970\nIt's either a gear or a little menu box.\n\n147\n00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.280\nIf you click on this,\nit'll provide you with more options.\n\n148\n00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.330\nSo the first thing I wanna show you\nin this options menu is how to change\n\n149\n00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.420\nwhat the brushes look like in here.\n\n150\n00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.410\nSo let's say that you prefer to look\nat large thumbnails of the brushes.\n\n151\n00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.100\nYou can.\n\n152\n00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.270\nYou'll notice that it changed my brush.\n\n153\n00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.740\nSo now, we can clearly see the difference\nbetween the brush bristles,\n\n154\n00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.740\ntheir hardness, all of that.\n\n155\n00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.193\nLet's say that you prefer to see the list,\nyou can change it to list format.\n\n156\n00:07:50.193 --> 00:07:52.855\nAgain, this is completely up to you and\nyour personal preference.\n\n157\n00:07:52.855 --> 00:07:54.021\nThat's where to find that.\n\n158\n00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:58.024\nNow, let's go onto\nthe calligraphy brushes.\n\n159\n00:07:58.024 --> 00:08:00.714\nSo you'll notice at the bottom\nof this fly out menu,\n\n160\n00:08:00.714 --> 00:08:02.930\nwe have all these different brushes here.\n\n161\n00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.390\nAnd you'll notice one\nsays calligraphy brushes.\n\n162\n00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.230\nSo I'm going to click on that.\n\n163\n00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.360\nAnd it says that I'm either\ngoing to replace, or\n\n164\n00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.630\nI could do something called appending.\n\n165\n00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.980\nSo let's look and\nsee what happens with both options.\n\n166\n00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.730\nSo right now it says replace current\nbrushes with the brushes from\n\n167\n00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.830\ncalligraphic brushes.\n\n168\n00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.990\nYou can go ahead and click OK.\n\n169\n00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.710\nBut if you notice your brush panel,\n\n170\n00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.980\nnow you don't have any of your original\nbrushes, which isn't really what\n\n171\n00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:34.130\nI want because I like to go back and see\nthose brushes that were there originally.\n\n172\n00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:38.014\nSo what you can do is go back to\nthat handy little gear icon, and\n\n173\n00:08:38.014 --> 00:08:41.094\nI'm going to click on\nthe Reset Brushes option.\n\n174\n00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.096\nOkay, and\nI'm going to click OK to replace.\n\n175\n00:08:46.096 --> 00:08:48.380\nAnd there I have my original brushes back.\n\n176\n00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.540\nNow, let's say I want to append.\n\n177\n00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.490\nWhat does append mean?\n\n178\n00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.250\nLet's try it out.\n\n179\n00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.940\nLet's add our calligraphy brushes.\n\n180\n00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.045\nAnd this time I'm going to\nclick append instead of OK.\n\n181\n00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.720\nYou probably notice it didn't do anything\ndifferent, at least on first glance,\n\n182\n00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.090\nunless you noticed that your\nscroll menu got longer.\n\n183\n00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:12.987\nSo if you scroll down, now we'll have\nour calligraphy brushes down here.\n\n184\n00:09:12.987 --> 00:09:19.988\nThen we can test one out so\nI'm just going to write hi, okay?\n\n185\n00:09:19.988 --> 00:09:20.847\nThere you go.\n\n186\n00:09:20.847 --> 00:09:23.700\nNow you have some calligraphy\nbrushes there for you.\n\n187\n00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.840\nOkay, I'm gonna undo all that and again,\nso what I did to undo more than once,\n\n188\n00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.750\njust in case you forget,\nit's control alt z, command alt z.\n\n189\n00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:33.550\nThat's what it is.\n\n190\n00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:38.915\nSo you notice if I just do once,\nI'll just be keep going back and forth.\n\n191\n00:09:38.915 --> 00:09:40.111\nNot what I want.\n\n192\n00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:41.597\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n193\n00:09:41.597 --> 00:09:42.212\n>> There you go.\n\n194\n00:09:42.212 --> 00:09:47.553\n[LAUGH] Okay,\nback to our little brush panel.\n\n195\n00:09:47.553 --> 00:09:52.240\nYou'll notice under Reset,\nwe also have a Load Brushes option.\n\n196\n00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.590\nSo you might want to load brushes if,\n\n197\n00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.340\nlet's say that you found some\nonline that are really cool.\n\n198\n00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.040\nOkay, so there's some great sites on line,\n\n199\n00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.540\ngreat resources where you\ncan get free brushes.\n\n200\n00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:07.090\nSo, for example you can get brushes for\nthings like coffee stains or spraypaint,\n\n201\n00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:08.210\nlike I mentioned before.\n\n202\n00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.660\nSo if you find one of those,\nyou can download that file path and\n\n203\n00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.380\nthen load it through here, okay?\n\n204\n00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.090\nIf you have certain brushes that you've\ncreated yourself, you can also save them.\n\n205\n00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:21.580\nWe're going to be creating\nsome of our own brushed today.\n\n206\n00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.110\nAny questions thus far?\n\n207\n00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.330\n>> No.\nVery impressive, though.\n\n208\n00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.150\nJust the number of different brushes, and\nnow that fact that you can go out and\n\n209\n00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.710\nget other brushed that other people\nhave created and create your own.\n\n210\n00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:32.310\nVery impressive.\n\n211\n00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.630\n>> All right so now we're going to dig\na bit little further into brushes.\n\n212\n00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:40.630\nSo I'm going to pick one of\nour standard hard brushes.\n\n213\n00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:44.650\nSo this is a hard round, you can\nreally pick whatever brush you want.\n\n214\n00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.050\nSo I'm just gonna click off of this so\n\n215\n00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.140\nthat way I don't have my\npanel distracting us anymore.\n\n216\n00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.570\nSo I'm going to just draw\na little squiggly line.\n\n217\n00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.630\nSo I haven't done any kind\nof adjustments to it,\n\n218\n00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.806\nthis is just the hard round brush,\nnothing fancy.\n\n219\n00:10:57.806 --> 00:11:03.112\nBut, you'll notice that we have these\noptions across this tool options bar.\n\n220\n00:11:03.112 --> 00:11:04.969\nThere's something called opacity.\n\n221\n00:11:04.969 --> 00:11:08.499\nSo right now you'll see that\nit's defaulted to 100%.\n\n222\n00:11:08.499 --> 00:11:12.924\nSo let's see the difference if I\nwere to change it down to 75%, so\n\n223\n00:11:12.924 --> 00:11:18.140\nI'm gonna just hard type it in, 75%,\nand let's draw right underneath it.\n\n224\n00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.660\nOkay, so you'll notice that it looks like\nit's almost a faded version of itself.\n\n225\n00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.967\nIt's really not faded, so\nmuch as it is transparent.\n\n226\n00:11:27.967 --> 00:11:33.969\nSo let's see what happens\nif we go down to 50.\n\n227\n00:11:33.969 --> 00:11:35.583\nOkay, even less so.\n\n228\n00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:37.068\nAnd then down to 25.\n\n229\n00:11:40.842 --> 00:11:43.642\nOkay, now, you can't really\ntell that you can see through\n\n230\n00:11:43.642 --> 00:11:46.500\nthe layer because they're not\nstacked on top of each other.\n\n231\n00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.630\nSo let's draw through\nthis top layer up here.\n\n232\n00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:54.800\nNow when I do,\nwith this brush at 25% opacity,\n\n233\n00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:00.410\nyou'll see that it looks like it's behind\nthe stroke, because it's so transparent.\n\n234\n00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:05.570\nNow if we were to raise the opacity,\nlet's say to 80%, and draw over it,\n\n235\n00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:10.170\nyou'll notice, if we zoom in,\nthat you'll be able to see where\n\n236\n00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:15.170\nit overlaps ever so lightly,\nbut it's still faded.\n\n237\n00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:19.490\nSo a transparency deals with how\nmuch you can see through something.\n\n238\n00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:23.250\nOkay, opacity for\nthe 100% you can't see through it,\n\n239\n00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.180\nif it's lower then you can see\ndown through it to the next level.\n\n240\n00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.380\nIt's a very important\nconcept in Photoshop.\n\n241\n00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.600\nYou learned it already in the layers\npanel, cuz you can make your layers\n\n242\n00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.180\ntransparent through changing opacity,\nyou can also do it with brushes.\n\n243\n00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.300\nOkay so that's opacity,\n\n244\n00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:45.120\nthere is one special little tool\nin opacity with the CC version.\n\n245\n00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.190\nYou'll notice off to the right,\nthere's this little icon that looks like\n\n246\n00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.760\na pencil with, it looks kind of like it's\non top of an apple pie for some reason.\n\n247\n00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.855\nThat's not what it is.\n\n248\n00:12:53.855 --> 00:12:54.920\n[LAUGH] If you hover over it,\n\n249\n00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.090\nyou'll see that it'll tell you that\nyou can use pressure for opacity.\n\n250\n00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:04.590\nSo if you turn this on, and\nyou hold down your mouse,\n\n251\n00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:08.060\nit will change how opaque something is.\n\n252\n00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.740\nIt's more obvious at certain levels of\nopacity than others but if you are trying\n\n253\n00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.880\nto create that authentic, spray paint\nlook, this might be a good option for you.\n\n254\n00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.100\nOkay, so that's that.\n\n255\n00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.960\nLet's erase just a few of these so\n\n256\n00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.210\nwe have a little bit more space And\nlet's talk about this concept of flow.\n\n257\n00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.130\nSo I'm going to change this back to 100,\njust so I don't forget to later.\n\n258\n00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:29.938\nAn important thing to note is,\n\n259\n00:13:29.938 --> 00:13:33.841\nthings like opacity like to default\nto whatever you had last time.\n\n260\n00:13:33.841 --> 00:13:37.977\nSo if you can't figure out why your brush\nis see-through, check your opacity.\n\n261\n00:13:37.977 --> 00:13:41.077\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Good to know.\n\n262\n00:13:41.077 --> 00:13:42.437\n>> Okay, so flow.\n\n263\n00:13:42.437 --> 00:13:46.990\nWhat flow does is, it sets the rate\nof how much color is applied.\n\n264\n00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:48.570\nSo let's test that out.\n\n265\n00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:52.090\nSo right now it's at 100%,\nwhich is our standard line.\n\n266\n00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:53.365\nIt looks fine, it looks good.\n\n267\n00:13:53.365 --> 00:13:55.525\nLet's change that to 50%.\n\n268\n00:13:55.525 --> 00:13:58.720\nLet's zoom in so\nyou can actually see the difference.\n\n269\n00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:04.280\nNow you will notice,\nif I zoom in even further, you can see,\n\n270\n00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.320\nas I was dragging my mouse,\nthese overlapping dots of colors here.\n\n271\n00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.440\nThat's because of the flow.\n\n272\n00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.080\nOkay, kind of a complicated concept.\n\n273\n00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.650\nYou don't use flow all that often.\n\n274\n00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:19.709\nYou use opacity a lot more.\n\n275\n00:14:19.709 --> 00:14:23.480\n>> Is flow trying to be like, I'm trying\nto think of a good example of when you\n\n276\n00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.980\nmight wanna do something like that, where\nyou're spray painting and the spray paint\n\n277\n00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.590\ncan is sputtering and running out,\nthat's kinda the same concept?\n\n278\n00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:30.250\n>> Exactly.\n\n279\n00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.630\nYep.\nVery much the same.\n\n280\n00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:34.310\nOkay, I'm gonna take that back up to 100%.\n\n281\n00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.250\nSo now I'm back to my default opacity and\nflow.\n\n282\n00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:42.830\nUp at the top, you'll notice we\nalso have something called Mode.\n\n283\n00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.650\nMode isn't something we've\nreally touched on yet.\n\n284\n00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:49.250\nIt's something we're going to be\ngoing over in depth with layers and\n\n285\n00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:52.030\nphoto editing, but\nwe can do it with brushes, as well.\n\n286\n00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.550\nSo let's demonstrate a few of these guys.\n\n287\n00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.130\nLet's click on Dissolve first.\n\n288\n00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:01.810\nSo I'm going to paint across this and\nyou'll notice that if I zoom in, now all\n\n289\n00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:06.710\nof a sudden we have kind of this rough\npixelation, it almost looks like a crayon.\n\n290\n00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:07.710\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n291\n00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:08.313\n>> Okay?\n\n292\n00:15:08.313 --> 00:15:09.840\nSo that's our dissolve.\n\n293\n00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.180\nLet's try color burn.\n\n294\n00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:16.780\nIf we use our color burn,\n\n295\n00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:21.490\nyou'll notice that it's almost making it,\nit is making it darker.\n\n296\n00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:22.520\nThat's really what it is doing.\n\n297\n00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:27.480\nIt's as if you were to take kind of\na flame to it and darken the edges.\n\n298\n00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:31.060\nSo it's something that you might use if\nyou're doing let's say an old letter, and\n\n299\n00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.470\nyou wanna make it look antique.\n\n300\n00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:33.500\nThat's something that you can do.\n\n301\n00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.260\nThere are a few other options that you\ncan do in here, really tons of them.\n\n302\n00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.400\nAnd it's really an experimental thing.\n\n303\n00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.160\nSo you're gonna go through these modes and\nsay wow, that was unexpected,\n\n304\n00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.180\nright, look at that.\n\n305\n00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.242\nThis is our color dodge,\nso it's lightening.\n\n306\n00:15:48.242 --> 00:15:50.087\n>> Kind of the opposite of brown though,\n[LAUGH].\n\n307\n00:15:50.087 --> 00:15:53.909\n>> Exactly, so, modes are something\nthat you're gonna play around with for\n\n308\n00:15:53.909 --> 00:15:58.216\nyears and years and years, and you still\nprobably will never understand exactly how\n\n309\n00:15:58.216 --> 00:16:01.387\nthey work, because they're\nbased on mathematic formulas.\n\n310\n00:16:01.387 --> 00:16:02.992\nSo, don't worry about that.\n\n311\n00:16:02.992 --> 00:16:06.060\nJust experiment with them,\nplay with different colors.\n\n312\n00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.915\nIt's a pretty fun little mode for you.\n\n313\n00:16:09.915 --> 00:16:12.790\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna change\nit back to normal, just so\n\n314\n00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.450\nwe don't have any kind of weird\ncolor things happen later on.\n\n315\n00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:22.040\nAll right, so now we've gone over that\ntool, we've gone over the tool options bar\n\n316\n00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.730\nNow we need to figure out how to\nreally adjust the brushes themselves.\n\n317\n00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:31.880\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm going to\nselect a brush from my brush presets.\n\n318\n00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.990\nAnd I'm going to select this leaf.\n\n319\n00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:35.660\nSo the leaf has number 95.\n\n320\n00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.820\nIf you're looking at your tool panel,\nit says Scattered Leaves.\n\n321\n00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.610\nSo I'm gonna click on that.\n\n322\n00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.610\nAnd it defaults to 95.\n\n323\n00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.070\nThat's completely fine.\n\n324\n00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.750\nBut I want to do something a little\nbit more than what it is right now.\n\n325\n00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:53.900\nSo let's go ahead and\njust erase all of this.\n\n326\n00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.460\nSo I'm gonna go into my layers panel.\n\n327\n00:16:55.460 --> 00:17:00.320\nAnd instead of erasing like I had before,\nI'm just going to create a new layer.\n\n328\n00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.330\nAnd unlock this guy and hide it.\n\n329\n00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:05.360\nOkay, so there.\n\n330\n00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.470\nWe have our blank layer.\n\n331\n00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.315\nAnd that helps refresh you on\nwhere our Layers panel is.\n\n332\n00:17:09.315 --> 00:17:11.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n333\n00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:14.340\nlet's see what this little\nleaf brush looks like.\n\n334\n00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:20.530\nSo, it's kind of hard to see,\nbecause it's on a transparent layer.\n\n335\n00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.320\nSo we need to make this background white.\n\n336\n00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.340\nSo I mentioned earlier that there's\nsomething called the paint bucket tool.\n\n337\n00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.938\nLet's do that instead of making\na really large 5,000 pixel brush.\n\n338\n00:17:28.938 --> 00:17:31.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz that's just silly to do.\n\n339\n00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:35.160\nSo the paint bucket is two tools\ndown from where my brush tool is.\n\n340\n00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.230\nIt might be somewhere\nelse on your tool panel.\n\n341\n00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:37.810\nJust look for\n\n342\n00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:42.349\nits hidden beneath what's called the\ngradient tool which is this fading box.\n\n343\n00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.520\nSo if I were to make this a solid\ncolor right now if I clicked,\n\n344\n00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.400\nit would be this purple color.\n\n345\n00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.810\nNot want I want at all.\n\n346\n00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:53.960\nLet's just not do that.\n\n347\n00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.630\nLet's make it instead white.\n\n348\n00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.840\nSo white is all the way up\nin this upper left corner.\n\n349\n00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.130\nWhat I did was I drug my house up there.\n\n350\n00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:07.480\nYou can also type in [FOREIGN], if you\nhappen to know that, down at the bottom.\n\n351\n00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.300\nWe're going to talk about that\nin our next color lecture.\n\n352\n00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:12.450\nSo let's do this.\n\n353\n00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.950\nSo now you can see these brushes but\n\n354\n00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.860\nthey look kind of silly\nbecause of the transparency.\n\n355\n00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.240\nSo I am going to just.\n\n356\n00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:23.280\nIgnore this guy, so this is what happens\nif you have a brush on transparent layer.\n\n357\n00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.230\nIt's probably not what you\nwant it to look like, so\n\n358\n00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.360\nlet's just create a new blank layer and\nfill it.\n\n359\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.200\nOkay, lovely.\n\n360\n00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.430\nAll right, so\nlet's go into our brush again.\n\n361\n00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:38.460\nHere's our leaf at 95, so if I were\nto draw with it let's make it black.\n\n362\n00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.339\nSo to do that I'm going to click\non these two little arrow tools.\n\n363\n00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:46.020\nAnd here we have these black leaves.\n\n364\n00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.800\nPretty cool, what it does.\n\n365\n00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.480\nBut I want to customize it even further.\n\n366\n00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.180\nThe way that you can do that is\nby adjusting its brush presets.\n\n367\n00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.370\nThere's this little folder.\n\n368\n00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.330\nThat looks like it has\nlittle flowers on it.\n\n369\n00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:59.790\nIt's actually supposed to be brushes and\n\n370\n00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.910\na pencil type cup, but\nit always looks like flowers to me.\n\n371\n00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Now if you open this brush\n\n372\n00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.260\npresets window, you'll notice all of\nthese different options that you have.\n\n373\n00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.910\nSo we're gonna kinda click through\nthese and see what these do.\n\n374\n00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:16.110\nNow at the bottom of your screen\nyou'll notice that you have this\n\n375\n00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.870\nIt's kinda square.\n\n376\n00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.910\nThat has the information in it for you.\n\n377\n00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.230\nSo it shows you what's adjusting\nwhen you play around with these.\n\n378\n00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:25.665\nSo let's play with the size and\nsee what that does.\n\n379\n00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:30.320\nSo size, as you guessed,\nit changes the size of the leaves.\n\n380\n00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.770\nSo you'll see there,\nthey're changing as I draw around.\n\n381\n00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.860\nThe minimum diameter you\ncan play around with, too.\n\n382\n00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.070\nAll of this.\n\n383\n00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.670\nAnd let's go ahead into scattering,\ncause scattering is really neat.\n\n384\n00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.060\nIf I were to turn off scattering,\nit would be in a straight line.\n\n385\n00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.350\nSo let me demonstrate that for you.\n\n386\n00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.905\nNot super interesting.\n\n387\n00:19:51.905 --> 00:19:52.930\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n388\n00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.200\n>> It's kind of like an old border that\nyou might see in one of your old programs\n\n389\n00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.160\non your computer.\n\n390\n00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.870\nNot really that exciting.\n\n391\n00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:03.890\nSo scattering, what it does is it\nchanges the direction of the leaves,\n\n392\n00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:05.320\nit makes them more random.\n\n393\n00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.670\nSo if you were going for a more random\nlook, this might be what you wanna do.\n\n394\n00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.020\nNow you can change how much they scatter.\n\n395\n00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.740\nSo if I scatter more,\nthat means there's more white space or\n\n396\n00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.450\nnegative space between the leaves.\n\n397\n00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:21.260\nYou can also change the count.\n\n398\n00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.750\nAnd again, you can slide all these.\n\n399\n00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.660\nSo if I were to change the count\nto be even greater than it is now,\n\n400\n00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.090\nthat just means they're going\nto be more overlapping.\n\n401\n00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:31.950\nOkay.\n\n402\n00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.120\nSo now that we have\njust a mess of leaves-,\n\n403\n00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.110\n>> We have a lot of leaves.\n\n404\n00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.965\nTime for a rake.\n\n405\n00:20:35.965 --> 00:20:36.900\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I think so.\n\n406\n00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.220\nLet me go ahead and get this back.\n\n407\n00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:39.890\nOkay.\n\n408\n00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:41.470\nAnd let's go into texture.\n\n409\n00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.468\nSo texture is something\nthat's pretty neat.\n\n410\n00:20:43.468 --> 00:20:48.680\nThere are built-in textures in Photoshop,\nso you're welcome to change them out.\n\n411\n00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.010\nSo you can make them look like marble, you\ncan make them look like whatever you want.\n\n412\n00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:53.870\nIt's something that you don't\nuse a lot with brushes, but\n\n413\n00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:55.260\nyou do use it other places.\n\n414\n00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.780\nI'm gonna uncheck that box.\n\n415\n00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.530\nNow, if you check a box and\nyou notice it didn't do anything,\n\n416\n00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:04.310\nthe reason why is because you have\nto click on the word as well.\n\n417\n00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:09.610\nSo if you click on the word,\nthat will bring up your options, okay.\n\n418\n00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:13.960\nSame thing with the fx panel, the layer\nstyles panel that we're going to be going\n\n419\n00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.530\nover a little bit later on in Photoshop.\n\n420\n00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.110\nColor dynamic, now this one is pretty fun.\n\n421\n00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.880\nLet's go ahead and\n\n422\n00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.530\nchange the color from white which\nis my foreground color right now.\n\n423\n00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:28.660\nI'm going to pick a green\nfrom my spectrum.\n\n424\n00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.030\nReally doesn't matter what green it is.\n\n425\n00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:33.690\nYou can pick your favorite shade of green\nor you can go for a fall leaf, go for\n\n426\n00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:34.350\na different color.\n\n427\n00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:35.470\nTotally up to you.\n\n428\n00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.730\nThis is just for demonstration purposes.\n\n429\n00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:38.920\nI'm going to click okay.\n\n430\n00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.990\nAnd I'm going to go ahead and\ndrag across and you'll notice That I have\n\n431\n00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:47.360\ngreen leaves, I have some purple,\nI have some kind of yellow and brown.\n\n432\n00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.200\nThe reason why is the way\nthese jitters are set.\n\n433\n00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.850\nSo if you change the hue,\nthe saturation, they're going to adjust.\n\n434\n00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.330\nOkay?\nSo you'll notice now I have some brighter\n\n435\n00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.720\noranges in there.\n\n436\n00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.680\nYou'll play around with it.\n\n437\n00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.330\nIt's really fun to add color.\n\n438\n00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:08.200\nYou can also change your background\ncolor as well to get more variety.\n\n439\n00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.280\nSo you can really play around with\nthese really cool brush options.\n\n440\n00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.250\nYou can also create your own custom brush.\n\n441\n00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:16.740\nSo how you would do that.\n\n442\n00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:21.320\nSo let's say that I really like what\nI've done with this leaf brush, really,\n\n443\n00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.810\nwhat I want it to be,\nI wanna use it in the future.\n\n444\n00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.490\nWhat you can do is you can save it.\n\n445\n00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:27.890\nSo if you go down to the very\nbottom right corner,\n\n446\n00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.020\nyou'll notice this sticky note icon.\n\n447\n00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:34.510\nIt probably looks familiar to you because\nthat's exactly what it looks like in\n\n448\n00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.950\nyour layers panel as well\nto create a new layer.\n\n449\n00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:40.260\nSo if you click on this,\nyou'll see it says create new brush.\n\n450\n00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.080\nAnd you'll be given an option\nto name it something, so\n\n451\n00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.065\nI'm going to name mine Fall Leaves and\nI'm going to click okay.\n\n452\n00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:53.310\nNow let's check to see if Photoshop\nhas that brush I created.\n\n453\n00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:57.410\nLet's go up to our brushes up here,\nand just so\n\n454\n00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:01.460\nyou know it will save as your last brush,\nand if I hover over that.\n\n455\n00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.220\nYou'll see it says Fall Leaves.\n\n456\n00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.180\nSo it did save my brush.\n\n457\n00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:09.790\nSo my regular 95 brush that I was\nusing before isn't going to look\n\n458\n00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:11.770\nthe same as this modified brush I created.\n\n459\n00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:15.480\nLet's say that you were messing\naround with a brush and\n\n460\n00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.820\nyou really hate how it looks.\n\n461\n00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.760\nAnd you wanna go back\nto the original brush.\n\n462\n00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.940\nYou can.\n\n463\n00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.540\nWhat you can do is you can\nclick on the three lines.\n\n464\n00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:26.400\nSo this little hamburger menu\nup at the top of your panel.\n\n465\n00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.870\nSo instead of a gear icon,\nit's a little menu and\n\n466\n00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:35.220\nyou'll see that you can do reset on lock\nsettings if you have that were locked and\n\n467\n00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.560\nyou modified or\nyou can clear your brush controls.\n\n468\n00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.980\nSo if you do that It'll\nchange back to what it was.\n\n469\n00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.840\n>> That's very cool.\n\n470\n00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.400\nIt'll give you a lot of control over,\nI mean one they give you a ton of brushes.\n\n471\n00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:52.000\nAnd then the fact that you can\ncustomize any one of those.\n\n472\n00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.770\nThe options are endless.\n\n473\n00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.206\n>> They really are.\n\n474\n00:23:55.206 --> 00:23:58.810\nNot only that, but you can create\na brush completely from scratch.\n\n475\n00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:00.748\n>> Wow.\n>> So let's test that theory out.\n\n476\n00:24:00.748 --> 00:24:05.315\nSo I'm gonna erase all my leaves cuz It's\nnot fall anymore, we don't need them.\n\n477\n00:24:05.315 --> 00:24:06.330\nWe raked them, they're gone.\n\n478\n00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.900\nLet's say that I wanted\nto draw a brush myself.\n\n479\n00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.270\nI'm going to pick one of\nthese calligraphy brushes,\n\n480\n00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.960\nit really doesn't matter\nwhat brush you pick.\n\n481\n00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.490\nI'm just going to do the letter K for\nmy name.\n\n482\n00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:26.550\nI want my brush to be black, so I'm going\nto change my foreground color to black and\n\n483\n00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:30.610\nI'm just going to draw a K.\n\n484\n00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:33.540\nYou can draw the first letter of your\nname, you can draw a smiley face.\n\n485\n00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.560\nIt really doesn't matter.\n\n486\n00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.950\nWe're gong to go up to our Edit menu.\n\n487\n00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:44.210\nUnder Edit, if you look towards the\nbottom, you'll see Define Brush Preset.\n\n488\n00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.240\nI'm gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n489\n00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.310\nAnd you'll notice in my little box,\nI have that K.\n\n490\n00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:53.430\nI'm going to name it K, click OK.\n\n491\n00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:57.380\nNow you'll notice that my brush\ndefaulted to this huge K.\n\n492\n00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.620\nNow I'm going to change the size.\n\n493\n00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.520\nIt doesn't need to be 695\npixels unless I just really\n\n494\n00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.860\nwant the world to see a huge K.\n\n495\n00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:08.510\nI'm going to change it to 44 and\nif I draw with it, it'll do this or\n\n496\n00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:12.120\nI can just single click and\nput my K anywhere.\n\n497\n00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:16.560\nYou might be wondering,\nhow can I use this?\n\n498\n00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.240\nHow is that useful for me?\n\n499\n00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:23.030\nSome artists and photographers use\nbrushes for things like watermarks.\n\n500\n00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.320\nOr if you want to create\nyour artist signature and\n\n501\n00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.090\nyou just wanna do a single click instead\nof importing some kind of signature you've\n\n502\n00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:34.130\ncreated in another program, you can just\ncreate it as a brush and then there it is.\n\n503\n00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.480\n>> I see when you paint it with\nthose all the Ks are lined up and\n\n504\n00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.540\nthey overlap each other,\nit makes an interesting looking line.\n\n505\n00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:45.060\nDo you still have the same options like\nthe jitter that you were talking about,\n\n506\n00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:46.945\ncan I scatter those around like leaves?\n\n507\n00:25:46.945 --> 00:25:48.540\n>> [LAUGH] You sure can.\n\n508\n00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:53.110\nWhat you can do is, with your K-brush\nselected, you can go to this folder that\n\n509\n00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:57.270\nlooks like flowers, and\nthen you can add your scattering here.\n\n510\n00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.370\nScatter as much as you want.\n\n511\n00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:02.650\nIt kind of creates a cool pattern,\nlook at that.\n\n512\n00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:03.180\n>> It does, doesn't it?\n\n513\n00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:05.110\n>> There you go.\n[LAUGH]\n\n514\n00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.905\n>> Very good.\n\n515\n00:26:05.905 --> 00:26:09.570\nYou have all the same options there\nthat we have with the built in brushes.\n\n516\n00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:10.070\n>> Exactly.\n\n517\n00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.960\nI'm gonna show you one more thing\non how to make a custom brush.\n\n518\n00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.650\nLet me just delete all these Ks.\n\n519\n00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:18.700\nI'll leave that K because that's fine.\n\n520\n00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.380\nI'm going to place an image now.\n\n521\n00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.080\nWe're gonna go to File > Place Embedded.\n\n522\n00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.650\nLet's look for this butterfly PNG.\n\n523\n00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:29.400\nI'm gonna place this.\n\n524\n00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:33.610\nWe need to resize this butterfly,\nit's really large.\n\n525\n00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.418\nThis would be a huge brush if we had it.\n\n526\n00:26:35.418 --> 00:26:36.386\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's resize it.\n\n527\n00:26:36.386 --> 00:26:38.785\n[LAUGH]\n>> Invasion of the butterflies!\n\n528\n00:26:38.785 --> 00:26:40.545\n>> Yes, this is not a horror movie.\n\n529\n00:26:40.545 --> 00:26:43.175\nInstead, it's just a nice\nlittle butterfly in springtime.\n\n530\n00:26:43.175 --> 00:26:45.115\nWhat we're going to do is\nwe're going to resize it.\n\n531\n00:26:45.115 --> 00:26:48.085\nIn case you don't remember how to do\nthat while constraining proportions,\n\n532\n00:26:48.085 --> 00:26:50.695\nyou hold down shift and you drag a corner.\n\n533\n00:26:51.905 --> 00:26:55.495\nNow that I have my little butterfly\nselected, I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n534\n00:26:55.495 --> 00:26:57.580\nhit Enter to commit that change.\n\n535\n00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:02.070\nI'm gonna go up to up to my Edit\nmenu again, and I'm gonna go to\n\n536\n00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:08.600\nDefine Brush Preset and you'll notice that\nit has the K and the butterfly in here.\n\n537\n00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:12.130\nThe reason why is because I\nstill have my K on the screen.\n\n538\n00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.800\nIf this was a blank document and\nyou just had your butterfly,\n\n539\n00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.060\nit would only pick up the butterfly.\n\n540\n00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:21.380\nBut since we don't, we need to use\none of our selection tools, or\n\n541\n00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.580\nwe can erase the K,\nwhatever your preference is.\n\n542\n00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.870\nHere's our quick selection tool,\nwhere we can select our butterfly,\n\n543\n00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:32.450\nor for the sake of time,\nlet's just erase the K.\n\n544\n00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:40.730\nSince we haven't learned the eraser yet,\nI'll just show you where it is,\n\n545\n00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:45.120\nso here it is and then you'll click and\nit says smart object must be rasterized.\n\n546\n00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.190\nThe reason why, we don't have\nour Layers panel open right now.\n\n547\n00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:52.260\nLet's open up our Layers panel and\nlet's hide this K.\n\n548\n00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:57.710\nThere we go, we have a butterfly,\nit's a PNG, no background.\n\n549\n00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:00.290\nLet's go ahead and let's try this now.\n\n550\n00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:04.880\nLet's go to Edit > Define Brush Preset.\n\n551\n00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.010\nThere we go.\n\n552\n00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:09.470\nIf you ever get stuck and\nthere are weird things on your layers,\n\n553\n00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:12.020\nif you place an image,\nthe image will be on its own layer.\n\n554\n00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.190\nBut if you didn't, if you happened to draw\nsomething and you want to separate them,\n\n555\n00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:20.450\nyou can select them and\nmove them to different layers, or\n\n556\n00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:23.050\nyou can erase a piece if\nyou don't need it anymore.\n\n557\n00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:25.350\nPhotoshop's really flexible in that way.\n\n558\n00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:30.930\nIf we were to go ahead and name this\nbrush, I'll name it butterfly and if we\n\n559\n00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:36.840\ngo to our brush tool, we'll see butterfly\nhas been added as our very last brush.\n\n560\n00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.770\nI'm going to just cancel that.\n\n561\n00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:44.830\nLet's make it a new layer and\nlet's draw some butterflies.\n\n562\n00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.890\nThe reason why it's black right\nnow is cuz my top color is black.\n\n563\n00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:49.920\nThat's the color of my brush.\n\n564\n00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.760\nThat pretty much wraps up brushes.\n\n565\n00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.380\n>> Wow.\nThat was fantastic, Kara.\n\n566\n00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.110\nWe thank you for that.\n\n567\n00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.390\nA lot of great information.\n\n568\n00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.076\nWho knew you could do\nall that with brushes?\n\n569\n00:28:59.076 --> 00:28:59.880\nKara did.\n\n570\n00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now we do too.\n\n571\n00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.560\nThank you for that.\n\n572\n00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.060\nHope everybody enjoyed watching.\n\n573\n00:29:04.060 -->

00:00:20.854\nI'm your host Mike Roderick,\ntoday we're doing Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:25.380\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna be looking at brushing and erasing.\n\n5\n00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.610\nWe've already taken a first look at all\nthe different types of brushes we have and\n\n6\n00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.890\na lot of the different options that\nwe have available to configure and\n\n7\n00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.020\ncustomize, and\neven create our own brushes.\n\n8\n00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.370\nWe are going to take it a step\nfurther with the brushes and\n\n9\n00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.730\nbring you racing into the picture and here\nto help us with that is Miss Kara Page.\n\n10\n00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.900\nHow's it going Cara?\n\n11\n00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.690\n>> I'm great, let's go ahead and get\nright into this action here with brushes.\n\n12\n00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.100\nSo what we are going to do this time\nis we're going to be opening up a file.\n\n13\n00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.370\nSo you do have this file.\n\n14\n00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.240\nGo ahead and\nlocate it its called Lakeside.\n\n15\n00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.723\nSo I'm going to go to open in Photoshop,\n\n16\n00:00:59.723 --> 00:01:01.870\nso make sure you have Photoshop up and\navailable.\n\n17\n00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.995\nClick on open and\nthen I'm going to select lakeside.jpeg.\n\n18\n00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:14.620\nAll right so now we have this\nlovely picture of Tennessee.\n\n19\n00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.710\nIt's actually not even a lake,\nit's the Tennessee River.\n\n20\n00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.570\nBut that's completely fine.\n\n21\n00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.250\nNobody needs to know.\n\n22\n00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.660\nIt's our little secret.\n\n23\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.920\nWhat we're going to be doing is we're\ngoing to be experimenting with the art\n\n24\n00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.990\nhistory brush.\n\n25\n00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.510\nSo what we need to do\nfirst is unlock our layer.\n\n26\n00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.030\nAs a reminder,\n\n27\n00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.140\nto unlock you can just click on the lock\nicon to the right of background.\n\n28\n00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.160\nThere we go, now we have a layer.\n\n29\n00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.680\nNow lets make another\nlayer on top of that.\n\n30\n00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.200\nSo I'm going to click on my little sticky\nnote in the bottom right corner and\n\n31\n00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.660\nnow I have layer one.\n\n32\n00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.210\nIt's an empty layer I'm going\nto make my layer white so\n\n33\n00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.560\nI'm going to click on\nmy paint bucket tool.\n\n34\n00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.970\nMake sure white is your\ntop foreground color.\n\n35\n00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.010\nAnd then I'm going to single click.\n\n36\n00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.353\nSo goodbye Tennessee lake house.\n\n37\n00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:00.958\n>> [LAUGH] Well nevertheless.\n\n38\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.665\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n39\n00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:04.790\nI know, all of a sudden it's winter.\n\n40\n00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.070\nOkay, so we're on this layer one\nwhich is just a blank layer.\n\n41\n00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.080\nNow we are going to channel\nour inner artist, and\n\n42\n00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.460\nwe're going to become these impressionist\nartists it's gonna be really fun.\n\n43\n00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.560\nHow we're gonna do that is\nthrough the art history brush.\n\n44\n00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.090\nSo, to find the art history brush,\nit's over in your tool panel,\n\n45\n00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.050\njust like every other tool.\n\n46\n00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.900\nAnd it is the little brush icon\nthat has a swirly around it.\n\n47\n00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.060\nSo it's a brush with a little swirl.\n\n48\n00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.615\nTo me,\nit's like the Rumpelstiltskin brush.\n\n49\n00:02:30.615 --> 00:02:31.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know,\n\n50\n00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.310\nthat's what it reminds me of.\n\n51\n00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.900\nSo I'm going to click on\nthis art history brush tool.\n\n52\n00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.370\nNow I'm going to use my brackets\nto make my tip bigger or smaller.\n\n53\n00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.000\nIt's something that works with your\nregular brushes and erasers as well.\n\n54\n00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.370\nSo the left bracket makes it smaller,\nthe right bracket makes it bigger.\n\n55\n00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.189\nSo I'm going to use\na decently small brush size.\n\n56\n00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.990\nAnd I'm just going to just start clicking.\n\n57\n00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.030\nNow you'll notice,\nthat you have these crazy lines appear.\n\n58\n00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.020\nThis looks weird right?\n\n59\n00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.580\n>> It does.\n\n60\n00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.290\n>> What it's doing is it's picking\nup the colors from the image below.\n\n61\n00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.530\nSo, we're actually recreating\nthis picture, this photograph And\n\n62\n00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.050\nmaking it look more like a painting.\n\n63\n00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.290\nSo this loose line that we have selected,\nthat might not be our best option.\n\n64\n00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.350\nAll of your different\nstyles are right here.\n\n65\n00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.420\nSo we can do tight short.\n\n66\n00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.770\nSee what that looks like.\n\n67\n00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.540\nOr we can experiment with tight medium.\n\n68\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.680\nSee what that looks like.\n\n69\n00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.170\nAnd as we start dragging along and\nit fills in, you'll notice,\n\n70\n00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.750\never so slightly, that you're starting\nto see some kind of image appear.\n\n71\n00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.800\nNow this image up here,\n\n72\n00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.910\nthese are trees, and\nthen there's the house and the walkway.\n\n73\n00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.510\nSo if you do more and\nmore brushing you can make it larger,\n\n74\n00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.590\nI will do that for the sake of time.\n\n75\n00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.250\nIf you just keep going over and over and\n\n76\n00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.614\nover again, all of a sudden it will look\nlike you're some kind of amazing artist.\n\n77\n00:04:01.614 --> 00:04:03.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that instead of a photograph,\n\n78\n00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.670\nyou actually created this all yourself.\n\n79\n00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.550\nSo I'm just gonna make this very large.\n\n80\n00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.985\nThis is gonna be extremely\nimpressionistic so\n\n81\n00:04:10.985 --> 00:04:14.350\n[LAUGH]\njust for the sake of time.\n\n82\n00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.570\nFilling in all these gaps and it's just\nbased on what color is right below it.\n\n83\n00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.990\nSo this is an extremely abstract\nversion of the picture.\n\n84\n00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.410\n>> Now are you clicking each time or\nare you clicking and holding and\n\n85\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.990\nmoving around and it's changing what\ncolor it's picking up from underneath?\n\n86\n00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.550\n>> You can do either one.\n\n87\n00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.940\nSince I was clicking and holding down,\njust does it automatically,\n\n88\n00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.440\nyou can also just source click,\nit's up to you.\n\n89\n00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.190\nNow, you'll notice, if you look at\nyour two layers, Layer 0 and Layer 1,\n\n90\n00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.350\nthey look very similar because\nthe colors are the same.\n\n91\n00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.200\nIt's just,\nthis version is extraordinarily abstract,\n\n92\n00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.165\nnobody's gonna know what\nthis is just looking at it.\n\n93\n00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:52.890\n[LAUGH]\n>> But you could probably sell that and\n\n94\n00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.440\nmake some money.\n\n95\n00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.060\n>> Yea, maybe, maybe if you- [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n96\n00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.320\n>> If you really try.\n\n97\n00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.710\nNow the art history brush isn't one that's\nused all that often cuz there's something\n\n98\n00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.480\ncalled filters that do the same thing and\njust faster clicks.\n\n99\n00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.950\nSo this is something that exists\nif you want to experiment\n\n100\n00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.160\nwith your more artistic side.\n\n101\n00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.770\nAlso underneath this art history\nbrush tool is the history brush tool.\n\n102\n00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.390\nSo what it does is it lets you\nundo the brushing that you did.\n\n103\n00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.320\nOkay, so it's not so destructive,\n\n104\n00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.560\nit's just affecting your brush strokes\nthat you made with your art history brush.\n\n105\n00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.290\nOkay?\n\n106\n00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.070\nSo that was just kind of a one off\nrandom brush that didn't quite fit\n\n107\n00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.110\nwith any of the other brushes.\n\n108\n00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.595\nBut that's your art history brush.\n\n109\n00:05:36.595 --> 00:05:37.095\n[LAUGH]\n>> Very cool.\n\n110\n00:05:37.095 --> 00:05:38.270\nThat was very cool.\n\n111\n00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.040\nI like that.\n\n112\n00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.060\n>> Okay, so\nnow we're going to be talking about\n\n113\n00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.360\nerasers\n>> So,\n\n114\n00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.070\nerasers are this fascinating\nthing in Photoshop.\n\n115\n00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.500\nThey are great.\n\n116\n00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.160\nThey are more distructive\nthan other options.\n\n117\n00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.270\nYou're gonna be learning about\nlayer masks later on in Photoshop.\n\n118\n00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.810\nThat's usually your best way to\nerase things if you don't want to\n\n119\n00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.190\nreally erase it,\ncuz layer masks just hide.\n\n120\n00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.870\nBut if you don't want to see\npart of your image ever again,\n\n121\n00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.040\nyou can use your regular eraser.\n\n122\n00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.620\nSo let's try out that\nconcept of the eraser.\n\n123\n00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.160\nSo we can use this image that we have\nup here already because it's there.\n\n124\n00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.550\nSo I'm going to click on the eraser, it's\nover on the left side of my tools panel.\n\n125\n00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.640\nThe shortcut for\nthe eraser tool is the letter e.\n\n126\n00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.920\nSo as you're working in Photoshop\nyou're going to want to know\n\n127\n00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.890\nthe shortcuts, it's very fast.\n\n128\n00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.770\nI'm going to click on eraser.\n\n129\n00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.430\nAnd you'll notice that I\nhave a butterfly up here.\n\n130\n00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.430\nThat's odd, isn't it?\n\n131\n00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.060\n>> That's very odd.\n>> Well,\n\n132\n00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.400\nlet's see what happens if I single click.\n\n133\n00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.980\nOkay.\nSo I'm erasing part of,\n\n134\n00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.451\npart of my art history brush tricks\nin the shape of a butterfly.\n\n135\n00:06:42.451 --> 00:06:43.930\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> That's odd.\n\n136\n00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.810\nI wonder why that would be happening?\n\n137\n00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.730\n>> Wait.\nIf we think back, I think you told us that\n\n138\n00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.280\na lot of these tools remember what you\nset them to the last time you used them.\n\n139\n00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.060\nCould that be what it is?\n\n140\n00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.650\n>> That's precisely what it is, so\n\n141\n00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.680\nwhat we need to do is go into our\nlittle brush panel off the top,\n\n142\n00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.270\njust the same for the eraser and I'm\ngoing to pick just a regular hard brush.\n\n143\n00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.740\nSo this one is very large, so I'm gonna\nsingle click and you'll see okay,\n\n144\n00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.530\nnow I'm starting to see that\nregular Tennessee image behind.\n\n145\n00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.390\nOkay, so you'll notice that what happened\nwas it only erased the top layer.\n\n146\n00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.290\nYou can't really tell because\nthese layers have the same colors,\n\n147\n00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.520\nso let me demonstrate that for you.\n\n148\n00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.350\nLet's hide the layer beneath,\nso our layer zero.\n\n149\n00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.530\nIf I had that,\n\n150\n00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.790\nyou'll notice, all of a sudden, that I\ndon't have anything in this top portion.\n\n151\n00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:35.370\nWe erased it.\n\n152\n00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.970\nNow if everything were on the same layer,\nso if these were merged together,\n\n153\n00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:46.270\nand you erased,\nyou would be erasing everything.\n\n154\n00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.800\nSo that's why it's really important\nin Photoshop to use your layers\n\n155\n00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.530\nappropriately.\n\n156\n00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.080\nAnd so that way you don't\naccidentally delete something\n\n157\n00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.150\nthat you don't want to delete.\n\n158\n00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.690\nOkay, so the eraser works like a brush.\n\n159\n00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.730\nIt has very similar options,\nbasically identical options.\n\n160\n00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.780\nYou can change the opacity of an eraser,\nit's something that you might want\n\n161\n00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.570\nto do if you want to create\nmore of a feathered effect.\n\n162\n00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.340\nSo let's play around with that.\n\n163\n00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.720\nSo here is 48 percent and\nyou'll notice that it's.\n\n164\n00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:20.730\nIt's kind of making them see through there\nstill there but it's an overlay effect.\n\n165\n00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.040\nSo it almost looks like we ghosted\nthe image of it, so some of our\n\n166\n00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.570\nlittle ghostly friends popped in and\nnow there's some weird shadows there.\n\n167\n00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.060\nThat's because of that opacity.\n\n168\n00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:35.310\nSo erasers are something that you're going\nto want to play around with quite a bit,\n\n169\n00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:38.727\nand it can be very frustrating if\nyou forget what layer you're on.\n\n170\n00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:42.496\nSo as a reminder,\nalways look at your layers panel.\n\n171\n00:08:42.496 --> 00:08:45.278\nSo let's pretend like I didn't\nknow where I was and for\n\n172\n00:08:45.278 --> 00:08:48.700\nsome reason I was on my background\nlayer and I clicked erase.\n\n173\n00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.100\nThat is not what I want to do.\n\n174\n00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.810\nI did not want to take\napart part of my tree.\n\n175\n00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:59.540\nBut if you'll notice if I zoom in, you\ncan still faintly see part of the tree.\n\n176\n00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.965\nIt almost looks like a globe\nthe way that it's circle like that.\n\n177\n00:09:01.965 --> 00:09:04.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The reason why is because our opacity\n\n178\n00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.590\nis set at that 48%.\n\n179\n00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.785\nSo let's change it to 100.\n\n180\n00:09:11.689 --> 00:09:13.300\nLet's try that again.\n\n181\n00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.570\nNow it's a very hard edged erased piece.\n\n182\n00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.660\n>> There are no pixels left in that area?\n\n183\n00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.500\n>> No.\nThere are no,\n\n184\n00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.182\nthe pixels have left the document.\n\n185\n00:09:23.182 --> 00:09:26.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] There are no more pixels here.\n\n186\n00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.100\nSo just like you had with your brushes you\ncan also adjust your hardness as well.\n\n187\n00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.870\nSo if you didn't want it to be such a hard\nedged eraser, you can make it be more soft\n\n188\n00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:39.140\nedged so again, that sort of feathered\nlook is pretty popular in photography.\n\n189\n00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.750\nOkay, so those are your basic erasers.\n\n190\n00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.850\nSo, use it just as a brush.\n\n191\n00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:47.910\nThat's the eraser.\n\n192\n00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.480\nWhat if we want to do something else?\n\n193\n00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.060\nIf you'll notice, there are a few other\ntools hidden beneath this eraser tool.\n\n194\n00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.400\nSomething called the background eraser,\nand a magic eraser.\n\n195\n00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.850\nWe need to figure out what those do.\n\n196\n00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.510\nSo I'm going to just close\nout of this document.\n\n197\n00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.370\nYou don't need to save it unless you\nreally like the destroyed version of\n\n198\n00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.790\nthe lakeside house.\n\n199\n00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.250\nI'm just going to get rid of it.\n\n200\n00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:12.430\nI'm not going to save it, because\nif I did save it, I would overwrite\n\n201\n00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:16.940\nmy original JPG, which you do not want\nto do, cuz then you lose it forever.\n\n202\n00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:17.810\nSo I'm just not gonna save it.\n\n203\n00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.190\nOkay.\n\n204\n00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.390\nAnd now I'm going to\nopen a different file.\n\n205\n00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:27.930\nSo I'm going to go to Open, and\nwe're going to locate Sandwich.\n\n206\n00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.860\nOkay, so Sandwich, Open.\n\n207\n00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.640\nAnd there we have this sandwich.\n\n208\n00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.630\nIt's kind of a burger\nmelt type sandwich here.\n\n209\n00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.170\nAnd I'm going to go ahead and unlock it.\n\n210\n00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.370\nAnd I'm going to create another\nlayer to drag beneath it so\n\n211\n00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.980\nthat way we have this blank\nlayer in the background.\n\n212\n00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.560\nSo that way, if I wanted my sandwich\nto be on a transparent background,\n\n213\n00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.330\nthat allows us to do it.\n\n214\n00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.370\nAll right, so\nlet's test out these two erasers.\n\n215\n00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.060\nSo to access the other two erasers,\n\n216\n00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.910\nyou can click hold and\naccess that fly out menu.\n\n217\n00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.850\nThe background eraser tool,\nlet's try that one first.\n\n218\n00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:04.940\nLet's make this a lot smaller.\n\n219\n00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:10.700\nSo, I'm making my eraser smaller,\nby using my left bracket.\n\n220\n00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.390\nNow you'll notice,\nas I click on the left bracket,\n\n221\n00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.710\nthe size up in the upper left\ncorner is also changing.\n\n222\n00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:21.603\nSo, it's at 100 right now,\nif I hit it again it goes down to 90, 80,\n\n223\n00:11:21.603 --> 00:11:23.289\ngoes down by 10 pixels.\n\n224\n00:11:23.289 --> 00:11:25.220\nSo let's see what this does.\n\n225\n00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.450\nI'm going to just click.\n\n226\n00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:31.255\nAnd it says, there you go,\nwe are just erasing the background.\n\n227\n00:11:31.255 --> 00:11:34.140\nIt's just another way to do it.\n\n228\n00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:38.440\nIt works very similarly to some of\nthe selection tools that we used before.\n\n229\n00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.410\nBut this one is a little\nbit more difficult to use.\n\n230\n00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.281\nLet me zoom in for you to see.\n\n231\n00:11:47.453 --> 00:11:50.630\nIt's a little bit harder\ncuz it's disjointed and\n\n232\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:55.780\nyou have little pieces left over so this\neraser isn't really my favorite to use.\n\n233\n00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.360\nNow there will be times when you\nmight want to use it cuz, again,\n\n234\n00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.470\nPhotoshop you can do\nthings 25 different ways.\n\n235\n00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.580\nSo you might find a reason for\n\n236\n00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.160\nyourself to use the background eraser\nin a way that would make sense for you.\n\n237\n00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:11.570\nI'm going to demonstrate its brother\nwhich is the magic eraser tool.\n\n238\n00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.820\nSo the magic eraser tool is very similar\n\n239\n00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.620\nto the magic wand tool which\nyou've already learned about.\n\n240\n00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:24.820\nSo what this does if you click, it goes\nahead and erases areas of similar color.\n\n241\n00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.190\nOkay, so let's click again.\n\n242\n00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:33.140\nBut you'll notice, no, it erased part\nof my sandwich, that's not what I want.\n\n243\n00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:37.110\nI don't know if you remember, but do you\nremember what we did for the magic wand?\n\n244\n00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:41.500\n>> I think we had a tolerance setting that\nallowed us to control how strict it stuck\n\n245\n00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.570\nto that color.\n\n246\n00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:43.290\n>> We certainly did.\n\n247\n00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:47.950\nAnd if you'll notice up at the top,\nwe do have tolerance set at 32.\n\n248\n00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.510\nSo, let's undo what we just did.\n\n249\n00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:54.420\nI'm going to just click command z or\ncontrol z and let's try that again.\n\n250\n00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.220\nSo, what do you think?\n\n251\n00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.970\nDo you think we should try\na tolerance that's higher or lower?\n\n252\n00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.650\n>> I think we should go\na little bit lower tolerance.\n\n253\n00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:02.250\n>> All right, let's try that.\n\n254\n00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.360\nLet's try a tolerance of 10\njust to see what happens.\n\n255\n00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.332\nSo, 10 I just typed it in there,\n\n256\n00:13:08.332 --> 00:13:12.050\nhit enter, and there we go,\nthat worked nicely.\n\n257\n00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.970\nSo now it picked up the piece of the plate\nthat we wanted it to get rid of.\n\n258\n00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:16.900\nWe're going to do that again.\n\n259\n00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.810\nOops, but\nI wasn't careful about where I clicked.\n\n260\n00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.632\nNow, my cursor is huge,\nyour cursor won't be this huge.\n\n261\n00:13:22.632 --> 00:13:25.580\n[LAUGH] So\nyou'll have an easier time of clicking.\n\n262\n00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.460\nOkay, so let's say that I\nhave these leftover pieces.\n\n263\n00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.500\nI need to get rid of them.\n\n264\n00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.780\nThis is a great time to use\none of your selection tools or\n\n265\n00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.610\na regular eraser, so\nlet's go ahead and do that.\n\n266\n00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:40.530\nI'm going to grab the eraser,\nwe don't need it to be 548 pixels,\n\n267\n00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:41.640\nthat's a little large.\n\n268\n00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:46.016\nAnd this one,\nI'm going to set the hardness at 100% so\n\n269\n00:13:46.016 --> 00:13:48.590\nthat way when it erases, it erases fully.\n\n270\n00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:53.240\nAnd you can kinda go in and\njust really clean up this area.\n\n271\n00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.190\nSo the great thing about an eraser\nis you can make it as large or\n\n272\n00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.350\nas small as you need.\n\n273\n00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.690\nso if you need to get into this little\ncrevice right here between the two\n\n274\n00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:04.640\nsandwiches, you can.\n\n275\n00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.170\nSo using your brackets, the left bracket\nmakes smaller, the right makes it lager.\n\n276\n00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:12.650\nYou can get in here and really erase.\n\n277\n00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:17.270\nSo I'm clicking and holding and dragging\nbut you can just single click as well.\n\n278\n00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.380\nJust note that if you do erase.\n\n279\n00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.290\nLet's demonstrate that over here\nwhere we have some area to erase.\n\n280\n00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.870\nOkay, let's say I'm just erasing away,\n\n281\n00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.960\nerasing away and\noops I erased part of the sandwich.\n\n282\n00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:33.140\nNow since I was holding down on the mouse\nthis is all part of one status change.\n\n283\n00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.610\nSo now if I were to hit undo\nI have to undo everything.\n\n284\n00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.660\nSo it's always good to have stopping\npoints when you are erasing.\n\n285\n00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.240\nI'm just going to erase\na little bit at a time.\n\n286\n00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:49.980\nLift my hand off the mouse,\ngo back to erasing, and there we go.\n\n287\n00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.280\nSo.\n\n288\n00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.010\nYou can erase to your heart's content.\n\n289\n00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:56.330\nBut erasing is something you're going\nto do quite often in Photoshop, or\n\n290\n00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.360\nusing something called a layer mask,\nwhich is very similar.\n\n291\n00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:00.600\nOkay.\n\n292\n00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.370\nNow I'm not going to go in and get all\nthese little tiny pieces that are left\n\n293\n00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.200\nover, just because my cursor is huge and\n\n294\n00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.630\nI'm going to end up erasing\npart of my sandwich.\n\n295\n00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.780\nSo I'm not going to worry about that.\n\n296\n00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:14.160\nBut let's play around with that art\nhistory brush that we did before,\n\n297\n00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.600\njust to see what would\nhappen on the sandwich.\n\n298\n00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:21.310\nSo, I'm going to select my art\nhistory brush and drag around.\n\n299\n00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:22.220\nAgain, this is huge.\n\n300\n00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.350\nWe don't want it to be that large.\n\n301\n00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.990\nSo right now it's at 125,\ngoing to make it a lot smaller.\n\n302\n00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.740\nI'm gonna focus on the bread.\n\n303\n00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:37.168\nSo it's creating a very cartoonized\nlook so if you're going for this early\n\n304\n00:15:37.168 --> 00:15:42.350\n2000s cartoon look, this might be a way\nfor you to get it with just regular food.\n\n305\n00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:48.195\nSo you don't have to be an amazing artist,\nPhotoshop has your back.\n\n306\n00:15:48.195 --> 00:15:50.770\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Fantastic.\n\n307\n00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:56.210\n>> Okay, so there is one more concept that\nwe need to learn in Photoshop and it's\n\n308\n00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:00.000\nvery related to things that we've just\nlearned like erasing, things like that.\n\n309\n00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.150\nIt's the art history panel.\n\n310\n00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:06.070\nSo what we need to do is we\nneed to access that panel.\n\n311\n00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:08.490\nSo where do we go for our panels?\n\n312\n00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.580\nDoes anybody, do you remember?\n\n313\n00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.807\n>> I do not.\n>> You need a refresher?\n\n314\n00:16:11.807 --> 00:16:12.440\n>> I do.\n>> Okay.\n\n315\n00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.250\nI imagine our audience does\nas well because we haven't\n\n316\n00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.760\nworked with panels in a while.\n\n317\n00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:21.480\nSo let's go up to Window, and\nyou're going to look for History.\n\n318\n00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.370\nOkay?\n\n319\n00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.010\nSo you can click History.\n\n320\n00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:29.220\nAnd you'll notice that that\nlists all of our status changes.\n\n321\n00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:29.890\nOkay.\n\n322\n00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.290\nSo all the different times\nI clicked an eraser.\n\n323\n00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.960\nAll the times I did the art history brush.\n\n324\n00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.510\nThe reason why it says it just once is\nbecause I was holding down the mouse\n\n325\n00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:39.750\nthe entire time.\n\n326\n00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:45.310\nSo if I'd let go and clicked every time I\nclicked would be a new art status change.\n\n327\n00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:46.990\nA new history state.\n\n328\n00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:51.190\nSo what this does is it allows you\nto go back farther than just doing\n\n329\n00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.800\nControl Alt Z, Control Alt Z,\nControl Alt Z.\n\n330\n00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.536\nSo we can go and\nselect a very particular state.\n\n331\n00:16:56.536 --> 00:17:03.432\nSo let's go and just pick all the way up,\nlet's see, here.\n\n332\n00:17:03.432 --> 00:17:05.416\nSo I can go all the way up\nto a very early state, and\n\n333\n00:17:05.416 --> 00:17:08.550\nyou'll notice that my\nbackground has reappeared.\n\n334\n00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:12.550\nReason why is because now\nwe've erased back further.\n\n335\n00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.730\nNow there are even more status changes\nthat aren't showing the reason why is\n\n336\n00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:19.760\nbecause Photoshop defaults to showing\nyou a very specific number of\n\n337\n00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.320\nhistory states so\nyou can change that in your preferences.\n\n338\n00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.520\nIt's highly recommended that you\nhave a lot of history states so\n\n339\n00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.390\nthat way if you're doing some\nkind of really large document\n\n340\n00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:33.500\nyou can just go back at any point in time\nand go back to a specific status change.\n\n341\n00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.420\nOkay?\nSo you'll see as I click around in here,\n\n342\n00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.468\nyou'll see exactly what\nstatus change it is.\n\n343\n00:17:40.468 --> 00:17:42.850\n>> Fantastic.\n\n344\n00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:43.480\nAll right Kara.\n\n345\n00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.000\nWell again, another great episode.\n\n346\n00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.420\nA lot of very good information on,\none, a new brush.\n\n347\n00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.570\nWe saw that art history brush there.\n\n348\n00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:55.190\nAnd then a good look at the erasers, and\nhow we can use those to remove pixels.\n\n349\n00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.630\nRemember, that's the destructive way.\n\n350\n00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.830\nWe're going to learn about\nlayer masks in future episodes\n\n351\n00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.950\nthat are not quite as destructive\nto our original photos.\n\n352\n00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.250\nAnd we thank you for that.\n\n353\n00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.350\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n354\n00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.330\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike

00:00:21.150\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.840\nAnd in this episode, it's time for\n\n5\n00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.190\nanother one of those fun\nfilled try it out exercises.\n\n6\n00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.570\nWe're gonna be doing brushes in this one.\n\n7\n00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.480\nSo here to help us is Ms. Kara Page.\n\n8\n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.730\nHow you doing, Kara?\n\n9\n00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.680\n>> I'm great.\nAre you ready to test out your\n\n10\n00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.790\nbrush skill knowledge?\n\n11\n00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.090\n>> I am ready.\n\n12\n00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.190\n>> All right,\nlet's go ahead and get started.\n\n13\n00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.010\nSo open up Photoshop so\nyou're ready to go.\n\n14\n00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.640\nAnd this time we're actually going\nto create a document from scratch.\n\n15\n00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.210\nSo go ahead and\nget your window ready and rolling.\n\n16\n00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.240\nAll right.\n\n17\n00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.450\nWe we're gonna go ahead and\ndo new, or you can do file new.\n\n18\n00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.730\nWhatever version of Photoshop you have\njust make sure you access a new document.\n\n19\n00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.860\nAnd I'm going to make\nmine six by four inches,\n\n20\n00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.280\nthat's one of those\nstandard picture sizes.\n\n21\n00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.630\nAnd I'm going to change\nmy resolution to 72.\n\n22\n00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.060\nSo I'm creating something for the Web.\n\n23\n00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.830\nSo it doesn't need to be CMYK either,\nit needs to be RGB.\n\n24\n00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.530\nSo 72, RGB, we are good to go.\n\n25\n00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.650\nSo, let's go ahead and click OK,\nand there is my blank Document.\n\n26\n00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.080\nSo what we're going to be doing\nfirst is we're going to be creating\n\n27\n00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.020\na manmade gradient.\n\n28\n00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.510\nSo you don't necessarily know\nwhat a gradient is yet so\n\n29\n00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.010\nwe're just going to play around with\nbrushes and create a gradient of colors.\n\n30\n00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.050\nSo kind of a fading effect and\nthis is going to be our sky for\n\n31\n00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.290\nthis Little tutorial that we're doing.\n\n32\n00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.890\n>> Awesome.\n\n33\n00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.460\n>> So what we need to do first is we\nneed to select our color from the bottom\n\n34\n00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.080\nleft corner.\n\n35\n00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.530\nGo ahead and select some kind of blue\nthat you feel represents the sky.\n\n36\n00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.890\nSo I'm going to do a darker blue\nat the bottom of my document\n\n37\n00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.070\nfading into a lighter blue at the top.\n\n38\n00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.210\nSo I'm going to pick\none right around here.\n\n39\n00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.990\nYou can pick any blue that you like,\nthough.\n\n40\n00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.400\nIt's completely up to you.\n\n41\n00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.570\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and click okay.\n\n42\n00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.510\nAnd we need to select our brush.\n\n43\n00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.180\nSo to do that,\nwe would go up to right here,\n\n44\n00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.740\nwhere you have this brush tip and\nthe number.\n\n45\n00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.000\nSelect this down arrow.\n\n46\n00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.220\nAnd I'm going to just select a hard brush,\n\n47\n00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.040\nand I'm going to make it, maybe let's\ndo 80 pixels, see how that looks.\n\n48\n00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.400\nAll right, so this is a pretty large\nbrush, I'm just gonna click, hold,\n\n49\n00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.410\nand drag it across the bottom.\n\n50\n00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.040\nAgain if you wanted this to\nbe an exact straight line,\n\n51\n00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.900\nyou would hold own Shift as you do it.\n\n52\n00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.880\nBut, I'm not really interested in\nmaking it look straight, per se.\n\n53\n00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.900\nI just want this cool little\npattern that we're gonna have.\n\n54\n00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.090\nSo there's my first stroke in blue.\n\n55\n00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.170\nI'm gonna go back over to my\ncolors foreground panel, and\n\n56\n00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.640\nI'm going to select a blue directly above\nit, so it's just a little bit lighter.\n\n57\n00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.240\nDraw another line across.\n\n58\n00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.470\nYou don't want any white between them\ncuz you don't want this random white\n\n59\n00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.380\nstraight line cloud.\n\n60\n00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.040\nWe don't want that.\n\n61\n00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.130\nPlus we're gonna be creating\nclouds in a minute.\n\n62\n00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.200\nSo just no whitespace,\njust connect your lines.\n\n63\n00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.570\nWe're gonna do the same thing,\nadd an even lighter blue.\n\n64\n00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.120\nAnd then finally, your lightest blue.\n\n65\n00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.450\nSo now we have this sort of gradient,\nit's very rough.\n\n66\n00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.720\nNow if you wanted it to look\nmore exact and free-flowing,\n\n67\n00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.950\nwe would change the hardness,\nthe opacity, play around with that.\n\n68\n00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.590\nWe really don't care,\nas long as we have blue in our background.\n\n69\n00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.800\nThat's what we're going for right now.\n\n70\n00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.970\nSo, we're going to jump ahead and\nget a sneak peek at something, just so\n\n71\n00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.170\nwe know how to create a more\naccurate looking sky.\n\n72\n00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.930\nSo, what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to go to our filter menu.\n\n73\n00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.170\nI have shown you where\nthe filter menu is before.\n\n74\n00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.250\nI'm gonna click on Filter,\ngo down to this word called Render.\n\n75\n00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.320\nAnd you'll notice that it gives\nyou an option for Clouds.\n\n76\n00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.960\nNow before you click it, make sure that\nyou have blue as your foreground color and\n\n77\n00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.370\nwhite as your background color,\nor vice versa.\n\n78\n00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.780\nYou don't want random orange clouds or\ngreen clouds.\n\n79\n00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.780\nThat just wouldn't look [LAUGH] too good.\n\n80\n00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.310\nSo make sure you have blue and white.\n\n81\n00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.378\nWe're gonna go render,\nclouds, and there we have\n\n82\n00:04:10.378 --> 00:04:11.524\n>> Wow.\n\n83\n00:04:11.524 --> 00:04:15.032\n>> This beautiful cloud like pattern\nwith the click of a button, so see,\n\n84\n00:04:15.032 --> 00:04:16.230\nimpress your friends.\n\n85\n00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.380\nThat's a great trick, and it's card\nof like a card trick so there you go.\n\n86\n00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.880\nSo that's the first\nthing that we've done so\n\n87\n00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.810\nwe've created this kind of manmade\ngradient, we created clouds over it.\n\n88\n00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.770\nSo it's a pretty realistic looking sky.\n\n89\n00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.830\n>> It really is.\n\n90\n00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.750\n>> So now we're going to\nadd some grass to it, so\n\n91\n00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.320\nwhat we're going to do first\nis let's change our colors.\n\n92\n00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.040\nSo I'm going to make my foreground\ncolor a light green, so\n\n93\n00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.080\nI'm gonna click over here\non my color spectrum.\n\n94\n00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.670\nSelect a lighter green.\n\n95\n00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.420\nAnd then for your background color,\nselect your white box and\n\n96\n00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.230\nI'm going to pick a darker green.\n\n97\n00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.340\nSo I have two colors now, but that doesn't\nreally do me much good because if I just\n\n98\n00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.900\nsingle click with this brush,\nit just shows you the foreground color.\n\n99\n00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.690\nWe're not going to be using just\nyour standard run of the mill brush.\n\n100\n00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.110\nSo I'm going to undo what I just did and\n\n101\n00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.520\nwe're going to find\nthe brush we're gonna use.\n\n102\n00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.590\nSo, if you come down to this brush\npresets panel, we can scroll down and\n\n103\n00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.730\nfind the brush that says 112.\n\n104\n00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.800\nSo brush 112 is actually a grass brush.\n\n105\n00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.350\nIt'll say grass if you hover over it.\n\n106\n00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.390\nYou can also use it for things like fur or\nhair, but we're going to use it for grass.\n\n107\n00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.740\nSo I'm going to select that, it's 112.\n\n108\n00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.190\n112's a fine default.\n\n109\n00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.890\nGoing to click away from that so\nI don't see my panel, And\n\n110\n00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.050\nI'm just gonna click, hold, and\ndrag across the bottom of my document.\n\n111\n00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.830\nIf you just single click you can do that\nas well, but it does have that built in\n\n112\n00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.310\nvariance because of it's presents,\nso it gives that random look.\n\n113\n00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.002\nSo I'm just gonna click, hold,\nand drag across the bottom.\n\n114\n00:05:53.277 --> 00:05:57.416\nOkay, so now that this is nice and\nfilled in, now we have a sky and\n\n115\n00:05:57.416 --> 00:05:58.755\nwe have some grass.\n\n116\n00:05:58.755 --> 00:06:03.560\n[LAUGH] All right, so I'm going to\nstart using my Layers panel now,\n\n117\n00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.040\njust so we stay organized.\n\n118\n00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.180\nAnd that way, if I want to erase\none layer and not the other, I can.\n\n119\n00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.180\nSo let's go to our layers panel.\n\n120\n00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.340\nThis is our background layer.\n\n121\n00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.480\nThat's completely fine.\n\n122\n00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.990\nLet's make a new layer.\n\n123\n00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.860\nOkay.\nSo you're gonna click on this\n\n124\n00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.180\nnew layer icon at the bottom and\nI'm going to name this flower.\n\n125\n00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.040\nAll right.\nSo\n\n126\n00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.690\nwhat we're going to do is we\nare going to draw out a flower.\n\n127\n00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.990\nSo I'm going to use my brush.\n\n128\n00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.820\nAnd I'm gonna come up here and\nfind a brush that speaks to me.\n\n129\n00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.080\nSo a brush can by any\nkind of brush you want.\n\n130\n00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.960\nI'm going to use just one of these more\nartistic brushes up at the top, but\n\n131\n00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.970\nyou're welcome to use any\nbrush that your heart desires.\n\n132\n00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:42.780\nSo I'm gonna click on that.\n\n133\n00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.100\nAnd the 112 is gonna be little\nbit large for my flower.\n\n134\n00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.180\nBecause if I were to do that now,\nthat's not what I want at all.\n\n135\n00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.120\nSo I'm going to change over here,\njust to a solid round, and\n\n136\n00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.450\nchange the 112, let's try something,\nwe'll raise it by like 20.\n\n137\n00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.840\nOkay, that's a little bit better,\nalthough it's still probably too big.\n\n138\n00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.490\nLet's test it out.\n\n139\n00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.705\nLet's do Just do a single click.\n\n140\n00:07:06.055 --> 00:07:09.745\nThat's a little bit large compared\nto our grass cuz you do want\n\n141\n00:07:09.745 --> 00:07:10.905\nto keep proper proportions.\n\n142\n00:07:10.905 --> 00:07:12.225\nSo I'm gonna undo that and\n\n143\n00:07:12.225 --> 00:07:16.315\nI'm going to adjust the brush size without\ngoing back up to this brush tool bar.\n\n144\n00:07:16.315 --> 00:07:19.235\nDo you remember how to do that,\nhow to adjust the brush size?\n\n145\n00:07:19.235 --> 00:07:20.775\n>> The brackets.\n\n146\n00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:23.055\n>> Yup,\nthis is when you would use those brackets.\n\n147\n00:07:23.055 --> 00:07:26.850\nSo again, left bracket makes it smaller,\nright bracket makes it larger.\n\n148\n00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.800\nSo I'm gonna make it smaller and\n\n149\n00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.990\nI'm going to pick a color that\nwould look like a flower.\n\n150\n00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.620\nSo I'm going to pick I don't know.\n\n151\n00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.850\nLet's choose a nice kind of reddish color.\n\n152\n00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.640\nAnd I'm just going to draw any\nkind of flower that you want.\n\n153\n00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.620\nIt really doesn't matter.\n\n154\n00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.830\nI'm just gonna do a little\ndaisy type flower.\n\n155\n00:07:52.025 --> 00:07:54.730\nOkay, so now I have this flower,\nlet's say I want to use it again,\n\n156\n00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.950\nI want to make a brush out of it.\n\n157\n00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.490\nDo we know how to do that?\n\n158\n00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.280\nWe've learned it,\nlet's see if we can do it.\n\n159\n00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.220\nSo you'll notice that flower is on it's\nown layer, I did that intentionally so\n\n160\n00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.160\nthat way.\n\n161\n00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.030\nWe didn't have that same thing\nhappen with the K as it did\n\n162\n00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.150\nwith the butterfly where\nthey're both on the same layer.\n\n163\n00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.840\nWe don't want that so to just avoid\nthat flower's on it's own layer.\n\n164\n00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.520\nLet's go up to edit and\ndefine brush preset.\n\n165\n00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:26.900\nAnd you'll notice well doggone it's on\nthe background layer too so what can\n\n166\n00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.730\nwe do to just select the flower What we\ncan do is use one of our selection tools.\n\n167\n00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:38.100\nI'm going to just use the magic wand and\njust single click on my flower.\n\n168\n00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:44.750\nGo up to edit, define brush preset,\nand there we go.\n\n169\n00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.620\nSo if that ever happens to you if\nthere's some weird little glitch or\n\n170\n00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.440\nyou don't know why things are not\nwhere they are supposed to be.\n\n171\n00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.725\nThat's what the selection tools are for.\n\n172\n00:08:51.725 --> 00:08:54.530\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nI'm gonna name this flower.\n\n173\n00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.590\nOkay, so\nnow if I were to come over to my brush and\n\n174\n00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:04.390\nscroll all the way to the bottom, you'll\nsee I have a brush and it's called flower.\n\n175\n00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:09.090\nSo if I wanted to I could, let's go ahead.\n\n176\n00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.830\nOkay.\nWatch what happens if I try to click.\n\n177\n00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:12.560\nNothing.\n\n178\n00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.200\n>> Nothing.\n\n179\n00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.900\n>> What in the world?\n\n180\n00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.150\nWhy is that happening?\n\n181\n00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.740\nNow if you think back to selections,\nwhen we went over that,\n\n182\n00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.090\nwe have our running ants up here.\n\n183\n00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.520\nSo that means that we have\na selection that's active.\n\n184\n00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.640\nWhen that happens,\nyou can't do anything else.\n\n185\n00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.680\nYou're stuck.\n\n186\n00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.290\nWe need to deselect.\n\n187\n00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:30.944\nSo as a reminder, you can do Cmnd + D or\nCtrl + D to deselect.\n\n188\n00:09:30.944 --> 00:09:35.600\nSo now we're deselected, we should be able\nto just single click and get our flower.\n\n189\n00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.120\nSo there we go.\n\n190\n00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.590\n>> Very cool.\n\n191\n00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.800\n>> We have flowers.\n\n192\n00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.670\nWe could just do as many\nflowers as we want.\n\n193\n00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.340\nIf you wanted to draw stems you could, or\n\n194\n00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.940\nyou can create a custom brush preset\nwhere you can change the colors up.\n\n195\n00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.550\nYou can change the variance of\nhow large and small they are.\n\n196\n00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.180\nSo let's try that out.\n\n197\n00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:57.160\nLet's go ahead up to here to\nthis folder that has the little\n\n198\n00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.765\nflowers on it that are really brushes.\n\n199\n00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:00.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n200\n00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:04.780\nthen let's go ahead and\ndo some shape dynamics.\n\n201\n00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.159\nSo shape dynamics.\n\n202\n00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:12.300\nWe can change the size,\nwe can change the diameter, the angle,\n\n203\n00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.660\nhow round they are,\nlet's play around with the scattering.\n\n204\n00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.950\nRight now it's not scattered at all, so\nthey're all stacked on top of each other,\n\n205\n00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.050\nnot ideal.\n\n206\n00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:25.100\nIf you spread them out,\nyou'll have this fun little thing happen.\n\n207\n00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.280\nSo let's see what happens\nif we were to drag.\n\n208\n00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.855\nAll of a sudden we're just filling\nour document with these flowers.\n\n209\n00:10:29.855 --> 00:10:30.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n210\n00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.600\nwhat you could do if you wanted to\ncreate this kind of cool pattern,\n\n211\n00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.000\nlet's say that you want\nsomething on your notebook.\n\n212\n00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.620\nOr your making something for a client and\n\n213\n00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.420\nyou want to do a pattern with some\nkind of custom brush you did.\n\n214\n00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.330\nThis is how you would do it.\n\n215\n00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.980\nYou'd come into the presets and\nyou can just fill an entire\n\n216\n00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.710\nbackground with whatever kind\nof brush You really want.\n\n217\n00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:50.860\nSo this is a little bit much for what\nwe're doing, so I'm going to undo a few\n\n218\n00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:56.680\ntimes and get back to where we\njust have the one single flower.\n\n219\n00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:58.610\nOkay.\n\n220\n00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:03.650\nSo now I want to add a stem to this\none single flower how would I do that?\n\n221\n00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:04.809\nLet's go back to the brush.\n\n222\n00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:11.860\nAnd I'm going to change this brush to be,\nlet's try this,\n\n223\n00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:18.350\nthis round blunt medium, but\nlet's make it a lot smaller and\n\n224\n00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:25.660\nlet's see what happens if we go ahead and\ndraw it out.\n\n225\n00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.540\nNow it's red, I don't want it to be red,\nthat seem silly.\n\n226\n00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.640\nSo, before you draw with the brush\ntool make sure to change your color.\n\n227\n00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:36.711\nSo, I'm gonna undo that and\nI'm just gonna select some kind of green.\n\n228\n00:11:39.985 --> 00:11:43.470\nAnd draw just like that.\n\n229\n00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:47.030\nSo as you experiment with brushes, they\nall have different kind of looks to them.\n\n230\n00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:49.560\nSo let's zoom in to this brush so\nyou can really see the stroke difference.\n\n231\n00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:54.020\nSo this one has kind of gaps in it.\n\n232\n00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:57.220\nIt really imitates a real paint brush.\n\n233\n00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.900\nSo let's see what would\nhappen if we added to\n\n234\n00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.069\nthis little leaf with\na different kind of brush.\n\n235\n00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.620\nSo you'll notice that when\nwe're zoomed in this much, or\n\n236\n00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:10.510\nif you're using a large brush it will\nshow you the little bristle dots.\n\n237\n00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.690\nPretend as if you have a physical\npaint brush in your hand and\n\n238\n00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.090\nyou dipped it in paint, and\nthen just set it on the piece of paper.\n\n239\n00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.160\nThis would be exactly where\nthose bristles hit the paper.\n\n240\n00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.520\nSo let's go ahead and\nDraw out another leaf.\n\n241\n00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.830\nSo you'll see this one is kind of similar.\n\n242\n00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.170\nIt has more spacing,\nWe'll try it with an different color,\n\n243\n00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:30.980\nI'm going to reverse my colors over here.\n\n244\n00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.210\nLet's do another one.\n\n245\n00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:38.140\nSo this fan brush has a very\ndifferent type of tip.\n\n246\n00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:43.360\nAnd there we go.\n\n247\n00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.930\nNow If you didn't know and\n\n248\n00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:50.220\nif you just painted an entire little\npainting in Photoshop, I doubt many people\n\n249\n00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:54.810\nwould be able to tell the difference if\nyou got it printed on a textured canvas.\n\n250\n00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:58.605\nSo it'll be our little secret if you\ndecide to become a Photoshop painter.\n\n251\n00:12:58.605 --> 00:13:02.150\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right Carrie.\n\n252\n00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.670\n>> All right.\n\n253\n00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:03.830\n>> That was a lot of fun there.\n\n254\n00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:04.510\nThanks for that.\n\n255\n00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:08.180\nWe had a good time learning how to really\ntake everything we learned about brushes\n\n256\n00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.880\nand kinda combine it in an exercise.\n\n257\n00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.670\nAnd we ended up with a beautiful\nlittle scenery that we have.\n\n258\n00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.290\nAll right, well we hope everybody\nout there enjoyed watching.\n\n259\n00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.940\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n260\n00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:18.510\n>> And I'm Kara Page.\n\n261\n00:13:18.510 -->

00:00:24.129\nI'm you're host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:26.290\nToday we're doing Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:32.300\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna be looking at project management.\n\n6\n00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.160\nNow, don't get scared.\n\n7\n00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.330\nWe're not going into project management,\nbut project management for Photoshop.\n\n8\n00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.840\nAll right.\nThere are certain things that we need to\n\n9\n00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.370\nbe familiar with in order to keep\nour projects on track, as well as\n\n10\n00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.700\nbe able to pass that exam, and her to\nhelp us with that, is Ms. Kara Page.\n\n11\n00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.600\nHow you doing, Kara?\n\n12\n00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.790\n>> I'm great,\nAre you ready to talk about some concepts?\n\n13\n00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.810\n>> I am ready.\n\n14\n00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.160\n>> All right, so these are concepts\nspecific to your ACA examination.\n\n15\n00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.590\nSo let's go ahead and get started.\n\n16\n00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.030\nSo the first thing is what is project\nmanagement in the first place?\n\n17\n00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.645\nSo project management is understanding\nwhat your project is, who your\n\n18\n00:01:06.645 --> 00:01:11.710\nprojects for, what your deadlines are and\nwhat your clients going to even like.\n\n19\n00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.030\nSo the first step in project management is\nfiguring out who your target audience is.\n\n20\n00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.080\nSo, your target audience is a specific\ngroup of people that you intend to reach\n\n21\n00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.870\nwith your message.\n\n22\n00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.350\nSo let's say that you\nare designing a flyer, and\n\n23\n00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.790\nyour flyer is for high school students.\n\n24\n00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.230\nMaybe it's a flyer for Prom.\n\n25\n00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.300\nYou would think about your target audience\nwhen you're designing that flyer, so\n\n26\n00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.090\nyou would use colors that would appeal\nto them, fonts that appeal to them,\n\n27\n00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.740\nimagery that appeals to them.\n\n28\n00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.390\nOkay.\n\n29\n00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.330\nIf you were designing let's say, a mail\nout little postcard for the elderly, it'll\n\n30\n00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.980\nprobably look very different than what you\ndesigned for your high school friends.\n\n31\n00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.190\nSo that's your target audience.\n\n32\n00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.890\nYour target audience needs\nto be specifically defined.\n\n33\n00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.440\nSo your client might know\nspecifically who it is.\n\n34\n00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.070\nIf not, you need to decide\nwho you're trying to reach.\n\n35\n00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.790\nSo think about demographics.\n\n36\n00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.290\nDemographics are things like age and\nwhere they live.\n\n37\n00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.380\nPsychographics are things like\nattitudes lifestyles believes\n\n38\n00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.320\nwhat these people like to do.\n\n39\n00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.940\nSo an example target audience might\nbe like what I have on this slide,\n\n40\n00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.630\nhigh school students ages 14 to 18 who\nlive in Florida and enjoy surfing,\n\n41\n00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.450\nspending time with friends and\nusing social media.\n\n42\n00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.870\nSo if that were your target audience,\nyou kind of know who your trying to reach.\n\n43\n00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.270\nOkay?\n\n44\n00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.025\nThe important part of setting\na target audience is not only\n\n45\n00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:34.240\nare you going to be able to create\nmore effective designs, but\n\n46\n00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.540\nyou are going to be able to\nset project goals as well.\n\n47\n00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.260\nAnd last but not least is\nthe target audience determines your\n\n48\n00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.240\nstyle in the content\nof your final project.\n\n49\n00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.440\nSo that's why you need to\nfigure out who they are first.\n\n50\n00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.940\nSo once you know who they are,\nwhere they are, and what they like to do,\n\n51\n00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.170\nyou need to figure out your project scope.\n\n52\n00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.700\nSo your project scope is\nessentially an outline that\n\n53\n00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.960\nexplains exactly what you need to create.\n\n54\n00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.190\nSo if you're creating flyers, postcards,\nwebsites, this is where you'd list all\n\n55\n00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.190\nthose things out along with their project\nrequirements as determined by your client.\n\n56\n00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.170\nAlso under project scope is\ndetermining how much time each\n\n57\n00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.560\none of these projects is going to take.\n\n58\n00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.030\nSo if you're designing a logo,\n\n59\n00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.060\nmaybe you know that it normally\ntakes you four hours to do a logo.\n\n60\n00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.620\nYou would need to set aside at least\nfour hours to create that logo project.\n\n61\n00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.050\nAnother thing with project scope is\nyou need to know that all requirements\n\n62\n00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.640\nhave been met.\n\n63\n00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.890\nSo by having a list of\nrequirements from your client,\n\n64\n00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.300\nyou can cross check to make sure\nthat you've included everything.\n\n65\n00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.770\nSo let's say that you are designing\nsomething for print and your client says,\n\n66\n00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.760\nmy website has to be on every\nsingle piece of printed work.\n\n67\n00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.460\nYou would have a check off\nsystem that allows you\n\n68\n00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.430\nto double check to make sure\nthat you did include a website.\n\n69\n00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.760\nOnce you understand what you're creating,\nnow it's time to brainstorm ideas.\n\n70\n00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.720\nSo you know who you're trying to reach,\nwhat you're trying to reach them with.\n\n71\n00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.550\nNow you need to decide how you're\ngoing to reach them with your message.\n\n72\n00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.380\nSo this is the fun part of\nyour project management steps.\n\n73\n00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.928\nYou're going to brainstorming,\nresearching, sketching,\n\n74\n00:04:15.928 --> 00:04:20.450\nfinding inspiration, and\nreally getting inspired to feel creative.\n\n75\n00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.450\nNow if you are somebody that says\nto yourself, I am not creative,\n\n76\n00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.350\nthat is not true.\n\n77\n00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.713\nEvery single person has\ncreativity inside them somewhere.\n\n78\n00:04:27.713 --> 00:04:29.973\n>> [LAUGH] You are reading my mind.\n\n79\n00:04:29.973 --> 00:04:34.300\n>> [LAUGH] You are creative you just\nhave to find your inner creativity,\n\n80\n00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.630\njust think back to when you were a child.\n\n81\n00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.020\nSo maybe you were a kid and\n\n82\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.700\nyou had this big brown box because\nyour parents just ordered a new couch.\n\n83\n00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.940\nSo there's this huge box\nin your living room.\n\n84\n00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.820\nYou turn it into a fort,\na bus, all sorts of things.\n\n85\n00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.980\nThat is your creativity.\n\n86\n00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.850\nYou just need to tap back\ninto your inner child.\n\n87\n00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.630\n>> So\nnext time I work on a Photoshop project,\n\n88\n00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.760\nI'm gonna get my refrigerator box out,\nsit in there, and see what I can do.\n\n89\n00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.495\n>> You could.\nThat's a little extreme.\n\n90\n00:04:58.495 --> 00:05:00.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I might recommend just\n\n91\n00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.414\nstarting with sketching.\n\n92\n00:05:01.414 --> 00:05:03.000\n>> Okay.\n>> Maybe play some board games,\n\n93\n00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.450\nget out play a sport.\n\n94\n00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.680\nYou just never know when a creative\nidea is going to hit you.\n\n95\n00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.190\nSo if you hit a creative wall\nat any point, walk outside.\n\n96\n00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.130\nTake a different route to school,\n\n97\n00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.880\ndo something that's a little\nbit different to break routine.\n\n98\n00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.470\nSo once you have brainstormed,\nyou have some ideas.\n\n99\n00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.700\nNow it's time to doodle and\n\n100\n00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.840\nsketch out those ideas to see\nwhat kind of layout works best.\n\n101\n00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.140\nSo doodle, sketch.\n\n102\n00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.130\nYou can never sketch too much.\n\n103\n00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.240\nMaybe if you're designing a logo.\n\n104\n00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.140\nYou have 20 different logo ideas.\n\n105\n00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.830\nJot them all down, cuz it'll help you\ndetermine what ideas are the most solid.\n\n106\n00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.370\nIf you can't decide because\nthey're like your children,\n\n107\n00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.955\nyou love each one equally,\nask a friend for help.\n\n108\n00:05:41.955 --> 00:05:42.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or\n\n109\n00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.530\nask a client to see which\nthey feel is the most strong.\n\n110\n00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.795\nSo it's always important to\nhave your sketches on hand too,\n\n111\n00:05:49.795 --> 00:05:54.150\ncuz if you do meet with a client\nbefore you create solid comps,\n\n112\n00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.480\nwhich are computer\nversions of your sketches.\n\n113\n00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.370\nYou can show the client your sketches and\nthey will give you feedback, so\n\n114\n00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.820\nthat way you don't waste hours and\n\n115\n00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.422\nhours in Photoshop on something\nthat they don't like.\n\n116\n00:06:03.422 --> 00:06:05.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] The more time you spend\n\n117\n00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.250\nbrainstorming, the more effective\nyour time will be on the computer, so\n\n118\n00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.350\ndon't skip this step.\n\n119\n00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.910\nNow that you have your ideas,\n\n120\n00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.450\nnow it's time to actually\nengage in the design process.\n\n121\n00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.670\nSo you have your step one,\nnow you've sketched ideas on paper.\n\n122\n00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.700\nOnce you have your sketches,\nyou enter step two.\n\n123\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.240\nWhich is creating a mock up or comp.\n\n124\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.760\nSo a comp is a comprehensive.\n\n125\n00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.700\nIt's something that you create\non your computer in Photoshop.\n\n126\n00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.140\nIt's a visual representation of what\nyour final project will look like.\n\n127\n00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.800\nA comp is a prototype.\n\n128\n00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.940\nThat's another way to think of it.\n\n129\n00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.430\nSo think of it like what your\nfinal product will look like,\n\n130\n00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.300\nit's a rough draft, but\nit looks polished and clean.\n\n131\n00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.820\nStep three is presenting that comp or\nprototype to the client for review.\n\n132\n00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.045\nThey're going to give you feedback,\nprobably lots of edits.\n\n133\n00:06:55.045 --> 00:06:58.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just be kind, take in all the edits.\n\n134\n00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.180\nThey are the client.\n\n135\n00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.250\nThey're probably paying you for your work.\n\n136\n00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.079\nSo don't talk back, the client knows best.\n\n137\n00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:05.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So, just jot everything down.\n\n138\n00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.880\nDiscuss what changes are going to\nbe made and then make those edits.\n\n139\n00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.390\nAnd then you'll have your final document.\n\n140\n00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.600\nSo this is how you plan for\nthat successful project.\n\n141\n00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.650\nStep one is planning and analysis.\n\n142\n00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.210\nThat's where you determine\nall the items that you need.\n\n143\n00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.280\nThose items are called deliverables.\n\n144\n00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.820\nSo if you're creating three fliers,\none postcard,\n\n145\n00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.780\ntwo little emails,\nthose are all your deliverables.\n\n146\n00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.910\nYou'll need to write them out,\n\n147\n00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.920\nand that way you know that\nyou're not missing one [LAUGH].\n\n148\n00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.010\nStep two is scheduling, so figure out how\nmuch time you think each piece is gong\n\n149\n00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:44.110\nto take you, and then allocate time for\neach of those projects.\n\n150\n00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.990\nYou don't wanna feel like you are rushing,\nso\n\n151\n00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.900\nmake sure that you allow ample time for\nall of your projects.\n\n152\n00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.240\nStep three is actually building,\nso that is where you sketch,\n\n153\n00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.070\nyou create you design comps,\nyou get ready to show the client.\n\n154\n00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.950\nAnd then, you move into step four,\nwhich is reviewing and\n\n155\n00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.380\nevaluating with the client.\n\n156\n00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.690\nSo, before you even show the client,\n\n157\n00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.610\nfirst review your work to make\nsure there aren't spelling errors.\n\n158\n00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.095\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, do your spell check.\n\n159\n00:08:08.095 --> 00:08:10.970\nCheck to make sure that you've\nincluded all the mandatories.\n\n160\n00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:16.050\nSo a mandatory might be a copyright logo,\nor a logo, or\n\n161\n00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:21.040\na slogan, or any type of thing that\nwould be under your viewing section.\n\n162\n00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.180\nOnce it's evaluated,\nit's good to go, the client loves it,\n\n163\n00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.660\nnow it's time to implement or\npublish once you get that final approval.\n\n164\n00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.040\nSo implementing might be\nwatching a website live or\n\n165\n00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.290\npublishing might be actually sending\nyour document to the printer.\n\n166\n00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:39.040\nSo getting it print ready\nby looking at your proofs.\n\n167\n00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.410\nSo tips for successful project management.\n\n168\n00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:46.790\nIt's highly recommended that you\nwork with a project manager.\n\n169\n00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.620\nIf you work in some kind of design agency,\nchances are,\n\n170\n00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:54.280\nyou will have a project manager that make\nsure that you're on track at all times,\n\n171\n00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.480\nthey communicate with the client and they\nmake sure the client needs are satisfied.\n\n172\n00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.540\nThe project manager also keeps\nthe designer on schedule.\n\n173\n00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.480\nNow if you're standing out just\nby yourself, chances are you\n\n174\n00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.595\nare your own project manager, so\nyou need to be detail oriented and\n\n175\n00:09:09.595 --> 00:09:12.820\norganized to make sure that you\nmeet all deadlines on time and\n\n176\n00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.960\nthat you're delivering\neverything that you need to.\n\n177\n00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.130\nA project manager can also help up\nwith keeping up with scope creep.\n\n178\n00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.940\nScope creep is where there\nare changes in the projects once\n\n179\n00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.540\nthe projects are underway.\n\n180\n00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.940\nSo maybe a client decided to\nchange details of a sale.\n\n181\n00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.060\nYou need to make sure that\nyou include those changes\n\n182\n00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:35.120\nabout the sale in your Photoshop documents\nas well, or your products in general.\n\n183\n00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.020\nSo that was about project management.\n\n184\n00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.810\nNow it's time to talk about something\ncalled intellectual property.\n\n185\n00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.910\nSo what is intellectual\nproperty in the first place?\n\n186\n00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.630\nIntellectual property refers to\nany property of human intellect.\n\n187\n00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.370\nSo it's something that\nyou've created yourself.\n\n188\n00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.910\nSo if you've come up with song lyrics or\n\n189\n00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:57.800\nyou've taken a photo,\nthis would be your intellectual property.\n\n190\n00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.740\nSo examples of what falls under this\numbrella of intellectual property\n\n191\n00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.880\nincludes literary and artistic works,\ndesigns, symbols, names and\n\n192\n00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.680\nimages used in business.\n\n193\n00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.400\nSo if you're using a trade name or a the\nbrand name, that is copyrighted material\n\n194\n00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.640\nor intellectual property or\ntrademarked property.\n\n195\n00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.520\nThat means that somebody can't come in and\n\n196\n00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:23.590\nuse your name without your permission\nto sell a good or a product or service.\n\n197\n00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.275\nSo copyrights are what you're going\nto primarily be dealing with.\n\n198\n00:10:28.275 --> 00:10:31.285\nCopyrights protect intellectual\nproperty and gives the author or\n\n199\n00:10:31.285 --> 00:10:33.905\ncreator of the work exclusive rights.\n\n200\n00:10:33.905 --> 00:10:38.165\nSo let's say that you are an artist and\nyou did this beautiful canvas painting and\n\n201\n00:10:38.165 --> 00:10:42.880\nit took you 100 hours to do, and\nit was just beautiful, and it was amazing.\n\n202\n00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.610\nAnd you hang it up in a gallery,\nand then somebody steals your work.\n\n203\n00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.350\nMaybe not physically steals it,\n\n204\n00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:53.090\nthey don't take it from the gallery, but\nthey replicate it and call it their own.\n\n205\n00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.670\nSo maybe they go home in Photoshop,\nor they go home and paint it,\n\n206\n00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.830\nbased off what they saw you do,\n\n207\n00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:04.380\nthat would be taking over your exclusive\nrights to distribution and publication.\n\n208\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.820\nSo that is not okay.\n\n209\n00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.530\nSo if you see something\nthat's beautiful online, and\n\n210\n00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:13.020\nyou wanna re-create it exactly,\ndon't do that, find your own special spin.\n\n211\n00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.810\nCopyrights can only be given to\noriginal works of authorship,\n\n212\n00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:22.100\nwhich means that it is not\njust a copy it's original.\n\n213\n00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.530\nIt's something that you created yourself.\n\n214\n00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.230\nAn important thing to note is that\njust an idea can not be copyrighted.\n\n215\n00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.040\nSo if you have an idea, that's great.\n\n216\n00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.130\nBut that idea can't be copyrighted.\n\n217\n00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:38.420\nYou also can't copyright something like\na utilitarian good like a light bulb.\n\n218\n00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.200\nSomething that we use.\n\n219\n00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.470\nSo examples of works that can be\ncopyrighted include artistic, dramatic,\n\n220\n00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.120\nliterary and musical works.\n\n221\n00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.450\nSo, you can copyright a song,\nyou can copyright a book,\n\n222\n00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.630\nyou can copyright a movie.\n\n223\n00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.220\nAny of those things are copyrightable.\n\n224\n00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.310\nSo the 1976 Copyright Act,\n\n225\n00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:02.370\nthat is what gives us exclusive\nrights to copy or reproduce work.\n\n226\n00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:05.850\nSo if you're the author of the work,\nyou can decide\n\n227\n00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.600\nwhere you want it to be reproduced,\nwhere you want it to be displayed.\n\n228\n00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.800\nYou can decide if somebody\ncan create an adaptation or\n\n229\n00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.670\na derivative work based on your work.\n\n230\n00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:19.310\nSo a derivative work is something like,\nlet's say you wrote a novel.\n\n231\n00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.630\nAnd it's this awesome novel,\neverybody loves it.\n\n232\n00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.690\nThey want to turn it into a movie.\n\n233\n00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:29.020\nSince the original storyline was yours,\nyou would have to sign off allowing\n\n234\n00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.530\nsomebody else to use that movie\nbecause it is a derivative work.\n\n235\n00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.800\nIt's a secondary work\noff of your original.\n\n236\n00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:40.480\nYou also have exclusive rights to\ndistribute copies of your work, and\n\n237\n00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.160\nto perform and display the work publicly.\n\n238\n00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.550\nSo for example, songs on the radio.\n\n239\n00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.725\nRadio stations pay to play those songs.\n\n240\n00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:49.460\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n241\n00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.670\n>> If you have something\nthat's copyrighted.\n\n242\n00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:56.390\nYou need to include a copyright notice,\nwhich includes copyright or COPR,\n\n243\n00:12:56.390 --> 00:13:01.040\nyou can abbreviate it, the little\ncopyright symbol, the year, and your name.\n\n244\n00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.930\nIf you really want a solid copyright,\n\n245\n00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:10.360\nyou should also file your copyright claim\nwith the Library of Congress in DC.\n\n246\n00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.060\nIf you do that then you are more\nlikely to win a battle in court,\n\n247\n00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:15.980\nif it comes down to that.\n\n248\n00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.120\nIf you just slap, copy right on to\nthe bottom of the sheet of paper.\n\n249\n00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.510\nThat's great, you can do that.\n\n250\n00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:22.720\nBut!\n\n251\n00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.375\nHow is somebody going to prove in court\nthat you actually created it on that date?\n\n252\n00:13:27.375 --> 00:13:27.920\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n253\n00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.730\n>> Okay, so keep that in mind.\n\n254\n00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:34.710\nIt is your responsibility to add\nthis notice to your work, okay?\n\n255\n00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.570\nSo if you're doing something\nlike photography or art,\n\n256\n00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.542\nmake sure to add your copyright notice.\n\n257\n00:13:38.542 --> 00:13:42.480\nAll right, so\nI already explained this briefly,\n\n258\n00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.215\nbut derivative works are works\nbased on work that already exists.\n\n259\n00:13:46.215 --> 00:13:48.605\nSo, different version of a song.\n\n260\n00:13:48.605 --> 00:13:53.325\nSo, maybe a song was originally a pop song\nand a country artist wants to re do it.\n\n261\n00:13:53.325 --> 00:13:54.945\nThat's a derivative work.\n\n262\n00:13:54.945 --> 00:13:59.730\nYou do need permission from\nthe author to do that.\n\n263\n00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.320\nDerivative works, once they are created,\n\n264\n00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.510\nthey become separate\nfrom the original work.\n\n265\n00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.850\nSo a movie stands alone from the book.\n\n266\n00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.640\nAlso under copyrights is something\ncalled the fair use doctrine.\n\n267\n00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.050\nThe fair use doctrine allows\nyou to use copyrighted work.\n\n268\n00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.950\nYou can reproduce it for specific reasons.\n\n269\n00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.610\nSo often times,\n\n270\n00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:23.610\nyou can include copyrighted\nmaterial if you're reporting news.\n\n271\n00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.990\nIf you're commenting and criticizing\nsomething, praising for education,\n\n272\n00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.500\nparody and research.\n\n273\n00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.210\nSo there are four factors considered\nwhen determining fair use.\n\n274\n00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:37.820\nSo, fair use just means that you use\nsomething that somebody else owns, but\n\n275\n00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.490\nyou're using it for\na reason that is protected.\n\n276\n00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:42.390\nSo, these are the four\nfactors they look at.\n\n277\n00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.030\nThe first is purpose and\ncharacter of work.\n\n278\n00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:50.330\nSo, if you are, let's say,\ncopying a page or two of a textbook.\n\n279\n00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.900\nAnd you're sharing it with a class and\nyou are using it for\n\n280\n00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:57.070\neducation, that's going to be more\nlikely to be protected than if somebody\n\n281\n00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:01.690\nhad copied pieces of your work and\nresold them.\n\n282\n00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:06.650\nSo if it's a for profit use, that's\nprobably not going to fall under fair use.\n\n283\n00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.240\nThe second thing to look at is\nnature of copyrighted work.\n\n284\n00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:15.870\nIf the work has been published before,\nhow easy it is to access this information.\n\n285\n00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:19.920\nSo if it's a book that you can pick up in\nany airport and you're copying ten pages\n\n286\n00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.220\nof it, probably not gonna be okay,\nbecause it's easy to get a hold of.\n\n287\n00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.510\nYou're kind of hurting author's\nability to make a profit,\n\n288\n00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.370\nbecause people aren't gonna go out and\nbuy the book.\n\n289\n00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.810\nThey're just gonna read\nthe ten page excerpt, okay?\n\n290\n00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.500\nAlso if the work has been published or\nnot is a big thing that they look at.\n\n291\n00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.350\nSo if the work is unpublished.\n\n292\n00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:42.520\nLet's say that you are writing a story and\nit's a biography and you're just, Writing\n\n293\n00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.150\nit, your about to publish it, you've\nsent it to different literary houses for\n\n294\n00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:52.120\nreview and one of them publishes ten pages\nof it before it's been published by you,\n\n295\n00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.540\nthat would not be fair use.\n\n296\n00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:58.200\nYou have the original right to publication\nand distribution of your work.\n\n297\n00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.020\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\n298\n00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:04.430\nThe next factor they're going to look at\nis amount and substantiality of work used.\n\n299\n00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:10.190\nSo, let's say that you have a novel and\nit's a 100 pages long,\n\n300\n00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:15.750\nand you as a teacher, you copy just\nthree paragraphs out of that book.\n\n301\n00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.460\nThat's not a very\nsubstantial amount of work.\n\n302\n00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.840\nThat's probably gonna fall under fair use.\n\n303\n00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:25.040\nIf you had copied the most\ncentral points of that book, so\n\n304\n00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:30.142\nthe key plot outlines, you copied multiple\npages, that is a lot of pages and\n\n305\n00:16:30.142 --> 00:16:34.580\nit's a substantial amount of the work\nused, not gonna fall under fair use.\n\n306\n00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:38.260\nAnd last but not least, is the effect\nof the use upon the potential market.\n\n307\n00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.850\nSo, if you by using this artwork or\n\n308\n00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.180\nthis original copyrighted\nmaterial in a different way,\n\n309\n00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:48.880\nif that's going to negatively effect the\noriginal author, that would be an issue.\n\n310\n00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:53.580\nSo, whenever you're dealing\nwith copywrited material.\n\n311\n00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:58.670\nSo let's say that you are using\nimages that you found online.\n\n312\n00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:02.020\nSo, you're creating a pamphlet for\nsomebody, a brochure.\n\n313\n00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.710\nAnd you wanna use other peoples' photos.\n\n314\n00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:09.340\nMake sure you obtain permission\nto use those photos, okay?\n\n315\n00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.060\nIt's not always enough just to cite\nthe source of your copywrited materials.\n\n316\n00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.560\nAnd make sure you buy either buy\nthe rights to use that photo or\n\n317\n00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:21.040\nthat the photo is in the public domain and\nis free for use and distribution or\n\n318\n00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.550\nreceive permission from that author.\n\n319\n00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:28.450\nAnd now that you know a little\nbit of background, it's time for\n\n320\n00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.130\nyou to start designing.\n\n321\n00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.030\nSo, good luck.\n\n322\n00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.710\n>> All right, Kara,\nthanks for that information.\n\n323\n00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:34.990\nA lot of really good stuff there.\n\n324\n00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:39.550\nImportant terms and concepts that we\ncan apply to our Photoshop career,\n\n325\n00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:44.080\nas well as help us get past that\nPhotoshop exam, so we thank you for that.\n\n326\n00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.325\nHope everybody

00:00:20.569\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:22.702\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:22.702 --> 00:00:26.570\nwe're going to be looking at\nmasking within Photoshop.\n\n6\n00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.790\nWe've got layer mask,\nwe've got clipping mask.\n\n7\n00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.989\nWe've got masks for masquerade parties.\n\n8\n00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.785\nWait, maybe not the last one,\nbut definitely the first two.\n\n9\n00:00:32.785 --> 00:00:36.500\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nNick Page, how's it going, Nick?\n\n10\n00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.130\n>> Pretty good.\n\n11\n00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.640\nLet's dive right into masking here.\n\n12\n00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.000\nSo with masking, think of masking tape.\n\n13\n00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.560\nDo you know what you'd do for\nmasking tape if you're painting?\n\n14\n00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.080\n>> Yeah, trying to keep paint from\ngoing on to the wrong places,\n\n15\n00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.480\nthe places you don't want it to?\n\n16\n00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.883\n>> That kinda works, but in this case,\nwe're doing destructive and\n\n17\n00:00:52.883 --> 00:00:54.418\nnon-destructive editing.\n\n18\n00:00:54.418 --> 00:00:59.279\nSo we've been hearing these\nwords this whole time,\n\n19\n00:00:59.279 --> 00:01:04.120\nthis whole series,\nwhat is destructive editing?\n\n20\n00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.470\nSo do you-\n>> Not quite sure, but it sounds bad.\n\n21\n00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.800\n>> All right, so let's dive right into\nPhotoshop, and I will go over this\n\n22\n00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.190\ntheory with you, not a theory,\nit's just this whole concept there.\n\n23\n00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.950\nSo in Photoshop,\nI'll go to File > Open, and\n\n24\n00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.209\nthen here, I'll pick this waves picture.\n\n25\n00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.640\nSo, now, here we have our picture,\nI'm gonna zoom in just a little bit.\n\n26\n00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.490\nAnd I'm gonna show you the way\nwe've been doing things so far.\n\n27\n00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.410\nWe've been doing stuff with like\nusing the Magic Wand to erase things,\n\n28\n00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.870\nusing the Eraser to erase stuff.\n\n29\n00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.730\nSo, let me just show you how\nwe would normally do that.\n\n30\n00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.123\nIf I wanted to erase the sky,\nit would look pretty bad, but let's do it.\n\n31\n00:01:48.123 --> 00:01:53.595\nErase, it's just going, it's gone.\n\n32\n00:01:53.595 --> 00:01:58.930\nSimple, but now the sky is gone forever,\nunless I hit Undo,\n\n33\n00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.900\nbut say if I did a bunch of other\nthings after this, and then I wanted\n\n34\n00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.560\nto bring back that sky later, I'd have to\nreload the picture or undo everything.\n\n35\n00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.330\nBut if I don't have any undo states to do\n\n36\n00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.370\nthat, yeah-\n>> So\n\n37\n00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.020\nthat would be what we call destructive\nediting then because we're\n\n38\n00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.010\nactually destroying the pixels\nthat used to be there?\n\n39\n00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.510\n>> Exactly.\n\n40\n00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.610\nThis is the way that people\nhave been doing Photoshop for\n\n41\n00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.180\na long time until the whole concept of\nnondestructive editing came into play.\n\n42\n00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.730\nSo, here I'm gonna undo this\nbecause I don't wanna break things.\n\n43\n00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.710\nUndo and then undo, let's go to my\nhistory panel to show up these.\n\n44\n00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.670\n>> Bring our sky back.\n\n45\n00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.130\n>> Yeah, there, each step I took,\nback to where I opened it.\n\n46\n00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.578\nSo, first things first, I will start\noff my layers panel right over here.\n\n47\n00:02:43.578 --> 00:02:45.840\nAnd then, I'm gonna unlock this layer.\n\n48\n00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.583\nThis just can show you, so\nnow when I do your aces,\n\n49\n00:02:49.583 --> 00:02:51.542\nyou can see the transparency behind it.\n\n50\n00:02:51.542 --> 00:02:53.731\nI'm gonna undo that.\n\n51\n00:02:53.731 --> 00:03:01.600\nSo now, let me show you first layers.\n\n52\n00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.270\nWe're gonna create a layer mask.\n\n53\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.150\nA layer mask is a way to\ndo nondestructive editing.\n\n54\n00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.970\nSo first,\n\n55\n00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.630\nI'll just show you how to create it, and\nthen I'll show you what it all means.\n\n56\n00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.250\nHere, on the layers panel,\ngo down to this little icon.\n\n57\n00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.250\nIt's very small in the bottom right.\n\n58\n00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.030\nIt looks like a white square with a black\ncircle in it, kind of like a camera.\n\n59\n00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.530\nIt says Add Layer Mask, so\n\n60\n00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.570\nI'll click that, and now you see on the\nlayers panel right next to my thumbnail,\n\n61\n00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.000\nthere's a chain link and\na white rectangle or square.\n\n62\n00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.660\nThis is the mask.\n\n63\n00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.293\nLayer masking works based off\nof two colors, black and white.\n\n64\n00:03:38.293 --> 00:03:44.030\nAnd I'll just take my brush and\nstart painting.\n\n65\n00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.260\nSo, make sure the layer mask\nis selected right here.\n\n66\n00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.250\nAnd I'll just paint with a black brush.\n\n67\n00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.670\nNow, what does this look like I'm doing?\n\n68\n00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.600\n>> It looks like you're erasing.\n\n69\n00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.060\n>> I am, but the picture is still there,\nand you can see the thumbnail.\n\n70\n00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.020\nThe mask is what is having\nthe black on it, so\n\n71\n00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.590\nit looks like I'm taking what is on\nthe mask and erasing that from the image.\n\n72\n00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.520\nBut if I wanted to, I can right click\nthis and I can Disable Layer Mask.\n\n73\n00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.905\nMy pictures is still in its full glory.\n\n74\n00:04:16.905 --> 00:04:18.910\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n75\n00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.590\n>> Just the mask kind of\nmodifies the existing pixels-\n\n76\n00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.320\n>> Anywhere that you're painting black on\n\n77\n00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.880\nthat layer mask, it's gonna hide\nthose pixels, but not remove them.\n\n78\n00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.060\n>> Exactly.\n\n79\n00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.910\nSo with this, there's a common\nlittle thing to remember this by,\n\n80\n00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.500\na little saying, us Photoshop reviews.\n\n81\n00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.940\nIt's called black to conceal,\nwhite to reveal.\n\n82\n00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.100\nThat's how to remember this.\n\n83\n00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.310\nSo, if you can't remember that,\nthink of that whole thing,\n\n84\n00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.530\nif you're not sure which one is which,\nlike was it white to conceal?\n\n85\n00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.840\nThink of alphabetical order.\n\n86\n00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.479\nBlack to conceal, BC, and\nthen the rest, so white to reveal.\n\n87\n00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.390\n>> Okay.\n\n88\n00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.990\n>> So now with that in mind,\n\n89\n00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.510\nI'm gonna show you how to do\nanother way to create a layer mask.\n\n90\n00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.930\nThis was the quick way.\n\n91\n00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.431\nYou could also go to the layer panel or\nthe Layers menu and\n\n92\n00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:11.156\nthen go down to Layer Mask.\n\n93\n00:05:11.156 --> 00:05:15.600\nLet me get rid of this one first to show,\nI don't want to confuse you.\n\n94\n00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.720\nSo Layer > Layer Mask, now there\nare three available options right here.\n\n95\n00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.829\nThere is Reveal all, Hide all,\nand From transparency.\n\n96\n00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:29.487\nIf you noticed when we\ncreated the first layer mask,\n\n97\n00:05:29.487 --> 00:05:34.490\nit was a white square that we know,\nblack to conceal, white to reveal.\n\n98\n00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.960\nSo that was Reveal all,\nit was showing the entire picture.\n\n99\n00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.780\nWhat if I do Hide all,\nit'll create a black square,\n\n100\n00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.565\nwhich should make the image disappear.\n\n101\n00:05:42.565 --> 00:05:43.220\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n102\n00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.910\n>> So let's try that, gone.\n\n103\n00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.340\nNow the image is not really gone,\nI can just pull out my white brush and\n\n104\n00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.530\nthen start painting.\n\n105\n00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.803\nAnd I could actually paint,\nThe image back.\n\n106\n00:05:58.862 --> 00:06:02.639\n>> Really, so just whether you wanna\nstart with everything showing and\n\n107\n00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.611\nbring certain things back, or\nstart with everything hidden, or yeah,\n\n108\n00:06:06.611 --> 00:06:08.383\nyou get what I'm trying to say.\n\n109\n00:06:08.383 --> 00:06:13.596\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly, so those are two ways\nto do it, and there's also a different\n\n110\n00:06:13.596 --> 00:06:18.660\nway as well, if you had a different\nmethod of going about with doing this.\n\n111\n00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.470\nSo I'm gonna delete this again, and then\nthat third option was From transparency.\n\n112\n00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.336\nSee here, we don't have anything\ntransparent, it's all full pixels,\n\n113\n00:06:28.336 --> 00:06:32.430\nso what I'm gonna do is just,\nI'm just gonna cut around the.\n\n114\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.330\nDelete, do some erasing there.\n\n115\n00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.220\nSo if this is a random picture that I had,\nbut\n\n116\n00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.585\nif I was dealing with a PNG image,\nit already had transparency in it.\n\n117\n00:06:44.585 --> 00:06:45.860\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> This is where this would come\n\n118\n00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.200\nin to play.\n\n119\n00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.180\nLet's pretend that this\nalready had a transparent sky.\n\n120\n00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.888\nSo now I'll create Layer >\nLayer Mask > From transparency,\n\n121\n00:06:56.888 --> 00:07:02.510\nand this will already create\nthe pieces that I already deleted.\n\n122\n00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.490\nIn this case,\n\n123\n00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.720\nbecause I performed the erases just now,\nI could actually bring those back.\n\n124\n00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.740\nSo let's paint some white on there.\n\n125\n00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.950\nIt kinda works, but\nit kinda messes up, too.\n\n126\n00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.330\nCuz it's kinda trying to\nremember what I was doing.\n\n127\n00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.510\n>> Right.\n>> But this is very destructive anyway,\n\n128\n00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.200\nso let's go back to the beginning,\n\n129\n00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:29.058\nand let's do a few different things\nwe learned in the previous episodes.\n\n130\n00:07:29.058 --> 00:07:30.354\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n131\n00:07:30.354 --> 00:07:32.510\n>> So, let me go back, history.\n\n132\n00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.143\n>> So that transparency one,\nwhile you're getting that reset,\n\n133\n00:07:35.143 --> 00:07:38.473\nwith that transparency one, even though\nyou had transparencies in the image,\n\n134\n00:07:38.473 --> 00:07:39.930\nthat would become your mask then.\n\n135\n00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:40.812\n>> Right, mm-hm.\n\n136\n00:07:40.812 --> 00:07:46.885\nAnd then, now, we know how to\ncreate image adjustments and\n\n137\n00:07:46.885 --> 00:07:50.840\nadjust the curves and everything.\n\n138\n00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.280\nSo, let's just refresh on how to do that.\n\n139\n00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.210\nSo, Image > Adjustments, let me just\nplay around with the levels here.\n\n140\n00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.548\nAnd I'm just gonna pull on the histogram,\nyou kind of make the blacks darker,\n\n141\n00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:04.006\nmake the whites lighter.\n\n142\n00:08:04.006 --> 00:08:05.740\nGreat picture, right?\n\n143\n00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:10.700\nSo, now let's say I did\na few more edits to this.\n\n144\n00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.700\nWhat if I took a sailboat and\nput it in the background and\n\n145\n00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.010\nmaybe created a sun in the background or\na moon and then I realized my water,\n\n146\n00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.690\nright here, is too bright.\n\n147\n00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.820\nBecause I just did the editing\nthrough image adjustments,\n\n148\n00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:27.810\nthis is how the image is.\n\n149\n00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:32.100\nIt's essentially broken\nbecause it's destructive so\n\n150\n00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.550\nnow those pixels are changed.\n\n151\n00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.100\nI can't do anything about it.\n\n152\n00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.230\nWhat I will do the proper way to do\nthis non-destructly as John did that, so\n\n153\n00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.845\nnow unlock my layer just cuz I\nlike having unlocked layers.\n\n154\n00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:47.935\nAnd then I'll go to this.\n\n155\n00:08:47.935 --> 00:08:51.435\nIt's a circle with a black and\nwhite diagonal in it.\n\n156\n00:08:51.435 --> 00:08:56.746\nSo I'll click that, and\nthen this is a layer mask or\n\n157\n00:08:56.746 --> 00:08:59.470\nadjustment layer there.\n\n158\n00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.150\nThis has the same options as image\nadjustments except for, let me try it.\n\n159\n00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.790\nI'll do levels here.\n\n160\n00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:07.800\nSame thing.\n\n161\n00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.543\nI just pull them in\njust how we did before.\n\n162\n00:09:11.867 --> 00:09:16.540\nAnd then I'll just hit this\narrow at the top right.\n\n163\n00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.450\nThat will fly back that menu.\n\n164\n00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.520\nSo now, the same thing.\n\n165\n00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.010\nBut I can disable it and\nyou can see the original right there.\n\n166\n00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.570\nSo the adjustment is there but\nit's separately from the picture.\n\n167\n00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.640\nSo I'm not,\nI'm not modifying the picture directly,\n\n168\n00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.880\nI'm kind of pointing to\nthe modifications to the picture so.\n\n169\n00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.230\n>> Same adjustment end result but\n\n170\n00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.300\nit's not a destructive so\nI can go back if I need to.\n\n171\n00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.640\n>> Right, and I can also modify it.\n\n172\n00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:44.180\nSo now if I see these are too,\nthis is way too bright, I can just\n\n173\n00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.150\ngo back to this, double click it,\nand then darken down a little bit.\n\n174\n00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:51.390\n>> Handy.\n\n175\n00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.630\n>> Yep.\n\n176\n00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:58.430\nSo that is adjustment layers and\nthe basics of layer masking.\n\n177\n00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.430\nNow, there are a few other\nparts of layer masking.\n\n178\n00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.075\nThere is a quick way to do this.\n\n179\n00:10:04.075 --> 00:10:09.030\nLet's go back to here.\n\n180\n00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.570\nThere’s something called a quick mask.\n\n181\n00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.380\nAnd quick masking is kind of like making\na layer mask, but you can use it for\n\n182\n00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.630\nselections.\n\n183\n00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:20.570\nIt goes by the same black-and-white rule.\n\n184\n00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.460\nBlack to conceal, white to reveal.\n\n185\n00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.148\nBut, if you press Q on your keyboard,\n\n186\n00:10:25.148 --> 00:10:27.950\nt'll activate this little thing\ndown here on the bottom left.\n\n187\n00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:35.080\nEdit in the quick mask mode right there,\nand I press Q to make it quick mask mode.\n\n188\n00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.839\nAnd then when I paint,\nyou'll see it's red.\n\n189\n00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:43.450\nSo this is kind of, it would be black but\n\n190\n00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.645\nit kinda wants you to see what's behind\nit so you're not really doing it blindly.\n\n191\n00:10:46.645 --> 00:10:47.160\n>> M-hm.\n\n192\n00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.830\n>> It just helps you out.\n\n193\n00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:52.945\nAnd then, if you press Q again, It creates\na selection of what I just created.\n\n194\n00:10:54.055 --> 00:10:57.885\nSo if I wanted to select some items,\nsay if I was cutting out a flower,\n\n195\n00:10:57.885 --> 00:11:01.575\nI can turn on quick mask mode,\npaint the flower and\n\n196\n00:11:01.575 --> 00:11:03.605\nthen press Q again and\nit will have the selection done.\n\n197\n00:11:03.605 --> 00:11:05.942\n>> Nice\n>> So it's kind of a way to\n\n198\n00:11:05.942 --> 00:11:09.397\ndo selections a different way\nthan one of the non-smart ways.\n\n199\n00:11:09.397 --> 00:11:12.747\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right\n\n200\n00:11:12.747 --> 00:11:15.322\nand then\n>> No magic to\n\n201\n00:11:15.322 --> 00:11:16.092\nthat one\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n202\n00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:19.272\n>> Right, so let's get back out here and\n\n203\n00:11:19.272 --> 00:11:21.782\nlet's go back to making a layer\nmask just how we did it before.\n\n204\n00:11:21.782 --> 00:11:26.222\nJust clicking in the bottom\nright of the layer panel.\n\n205\n00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:31.000\nNow I forgot to mention, you see we have\nthe thumbnail, we have this chain and\n\n206\n00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.750\nthen we have the layer mask.\n\n207\n00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.110\nLet's do a quick edit to here.\n\n208\n00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.890\nI'm just going to erase.\n\n209\n00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.180\nSo this chain is actually pretty useful.\n\n210\n00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.790\nWhen I move this,\nlike say I want to move the picture.\n\n211\n00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.480\nIt moves the picture and the mask.\n\n212\n00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.640\nIf I wanna move the mask,\nit still moves the picture and the mask.\n\n213\n00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.050\nThis chain link connects\nthose two together.\n\n214\n00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.100\nSo if I uncheck this, now it's gone.\n\n215\n00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:05.710\nI can move the mask on its own or\nI can move the image on its own.\n\n216\n00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.910\nNice.\n>> So it's a way to,\n\n217\n00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.500\nif you want to manipulate things further,\nif you figured out, you made your mask,\n\n218\n00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.450\nand you're like, it's a little bit too\noff, I want to just nudge it back.\n\n219\n00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:22.440\nUncheck the chain, and then,\nmove what you need to and then retain it.\n\n220\n00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.690\n>> Very nice.\n\n221\n00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:29.130\n>> So, that's pretty neat and\nanother thing the next\n\n222\n00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:34.540\ntopic is very related to layer\nmasks it's called clipping masks.\n\n223\n00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:35.930\nThese are fun.\n\n224\n00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's stop these.\n\n225\n00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.280\nAlso, if you want to, on a side note.\n\n226\n00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:47.100\nSay if I want to apply this layer mask,\nthat means if I see this is good\n\n227\n00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.200\nI don't want to really further\nmodify it and I kind of want to,\n\n228\n00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.880\nI want to destructively edit\n>> You're done with it and\n\n229\n00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.010\nyou're good with the changes.\n\n230\n00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.500\n>> Right.\nI could right click and\n\n231\n00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.390\napply layer mask and\nthat will destructively edit my picture.\n\n232\n00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:01.960\n>> Okay.\n>> So\n\n233\n00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.670\nI like to always have the option,\nbut I'd rather have it always there,\n\n234\n00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:08.630\nnot applied so\nI can change it whenever I want to.\n\n235\n00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:13.110\nSo let's undo all this and\nthen I'll right click and\n\n236\n00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.240\nyou can just disable air mask if you want\nto just see what the original looked like.\n\n237\n00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.626\n>> Or you can right click and\nthen delete layer mask.\n\n238\n00:13:19.626 --> 00:13:20.787\nDone.\n\n239\n00:13:20.787 --> 00:13:23.686\n>> Easy enough.\n\n240\n00:13:23.686 --> 00:13:24.560\n>> Yep.\n\n241\n00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.080\nNow, it's clipping masks.\n\n242\n00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.000\nThey're just like layer masks but\n\n243\n00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.040\none special thing is that they are making\na layer mask based off of another layer.\n\n244\n00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:38.490\nThis might be sounding a little confusing,\nbut, let's dive into this and\n\n245\n00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.270\nthen we'll further explain as we go along.\n\n246\n00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:42.530\n>> Okay.\n\n247\n00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.590\n>> So first I will create,\nlet's create a shape here.\n\n248\n00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.756\nSo on my tool,\nthis would be the rectangle tool.\n\n249\n00:13:49.756 --> 00:13:51.690\nLet me fly out, click and hold and\n\n250\n00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.900\ndrag down to the,\nlet's go to a rounded rectangle.\n\n251\n00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.340\nSo, create a rounded rectangle right here.\n\n252\n00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:03.270\nIt's hard to see but it'll appear there.\n\n253\n00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:04.980\nThere it is.\n\n254\n00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.920\nSo, there's my rounded rectangle.\n\n255\n00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.610\nHere are the options.\n\n256\n00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.520\nI don't really want to mess with any.\n\n257\n00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.420\nI'll keep it how it is for simplicity.\n\n258\n00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.770\nAnd then, now, let me.\n\n259\n00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.240\nTo create the clipping mask of this,\n\n260\n00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.170\nyou'll kinda see what\nit does once I do it.\n\n261\n00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:26.550\nI want to bring my picture layer\nabove the shape that I wanna click.\n\n262\n00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:30.400\nAnd if I right click on the layer,\nI can go to create clipping mask.\n\n263\n00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:36.160\nAnd then now, you'll see, it cuts out\nthe picture for you at, as that shape.\n\n264\n00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.240\n>> Interesting.\n\n265\n00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.910\n>> So, this can be done in\nseveral different ways,\n\n266\n00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:45.223\nI can also say if I want to\ncreate a few more shapes, or\n\n267\n00:14:45.223 --> 00:14:49.770\nlike say I want to put a custom\nshape here and do this daisy thing.\n\n268\n00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.860\nSo if you go up to shape, you're gonna\nsearch all your custom shapes there.\n\n269\n00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.750\nI'll select this flowery object and\nI'll create one down here.\n\n270\n00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.120\nJust a little one.\n\n271\n00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.950\nSo there's my shape and I can actually\nmerge these shapes together if I hold\n\n272\n00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:09.940\nCtrl on my keyboard or Cmd if you're on\na Mac snd then have one shape selected and\n\n273\n00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.145\nclick the other other shape,\nit'll highlight both of them.\n\n274\n00:15:12.145 --> 00:15:14.060\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And you can merge them by pressing\n\n275\n00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.030\nCtrl or Cmd+E.\n\n276\n00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.830\nSo that merged these shapes together.\n\n277\n00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:22.520\nSo now I have to recreate\nmy clipping mask.\n\n278\n00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:27.480\nSo another way to do this would\nbe to hold Alt on your keyboard.\n\n279\n00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:32.030\nAnd then click right between\nthose two on the layer panel.\n\n280\n00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.750\nYour cursor changes.\n\n281\n00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:34.700\nS that's a quick way to do it.\n\n282\n00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.469\nSo alt, click that, there you go.\n\n283\n00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:38.545\n>> Nice\n>> So\n\n284\n00:15:38.545 --> 00:15:43.305\nnow I have both of these together and\nI can move my picture still.\n\n285\n00:15:43.305 --> 00:15:48.855\nIf I'm framing a picture, it's kinda\nlike the matte, I have an invisible\n\n286\n00:15:48.855 --> 00:15:54.115\nmatte there, which then I could fill\nin with a layer on the background.\n\n287\n00:15:54.115 --> 00:15:56.095\nLet's just make it black.\n\n288\n00:15:56.095 --> 00:16:00.210\nSo now it's kind like I\njust matted an image.\n\n289\n00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.548\n>> Right, very nice.\n\n290\n00:16:01.548 --> 00:16:06.782\n>> So, very useful, you could also\ndo the same thing with text as well,\n\n291\n00:16:06.782 --> 00:16:11.226\nso if I wanted to write beach,\nI'll just do it quick Text.\n\n292\n00:16:11.226 --> 00:16:12.021\nBeach there.\n\n293\n00:16:12.021 --> 00:16:19.030\nIt's really hard to see now, but\nlet me get rid of these shapes here.\n\n294\n00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.795\nIs that a beach there?\n\n295\n00:16:19.795 --> 00:16:21.000\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n296\n00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.348\n>> I want to put\nthe picture layer above it,\n\n297\n00:16:23.348 --> 00:16:27.460\nthen I'll right-click\n>> Gray clipping mask.\n\n298\n00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.940\nThere's the beach.\n\n299\n00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.490\nSo now, I could move the location\nof the actual text, or\n\n300\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.050\nI can move the location of the background.\n\n301\n00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.190\nThis is a good way to do some really cool\n\n302\n00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:42.120\ntext effects later on if\nyou want to do voice cards.\n\n303\n00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.450\n>> Absolutely.\n\n304\n00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.270\n>> That's really how they do it.\n\n305\n00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:48.130\nAnd it's also the best part about it is\n\n306\n00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.825\nthat I'm only showing the text\nwith the letters beach in there.\n\n307\n00:16:51.825 --> 00:16:52.680\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n308\n00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.310\n>> But, I'm not destroying anything.\n\n309\n00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.130\n>> So you can actually change\na word later if you wanted to.\n\n310\n00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:57.840\n>> Yep, exactly.\n\n311\n00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.750\nChange it to Nick.\n\n312\n00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:06.570\nDouble click the text thumbnail there.\n\n313\n00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:07.810\nSo now it's Nick.\n\n314\n00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.360\n>> Very cool.\n\n315\n00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.490\n>> So\nthat is the basics of clipping masks.\n\n316\n00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:14.510\nLet's see.\n\n317\n00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:19.610\nI think that's-\n>> So it\n\n318\n00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:23.140\nlooks like the important thing there with\nthose clipping masks was to make sure that\n\n319\n00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:27.130\nwhat you're going to use as a mask was the\nnext layer under the image has to be that\n\n320\n00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:27.810\n>> Next one break.\n\n321\n00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:33.130\nAnd also, one more thing before I forget,\nthere's a whole other topic.\n\n322\n00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.000\nLet's do, it's semi related.\n\n323\n00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.520\nIt's just kind of a bonus topic here.\n\n324\n00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.420\nBonuses are great.\n\n325\n00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.830\nThis is the refined edge.\n\n326\n00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:47.270\nI'm gonna close out this current thing,\nand I'm going to open a new project.\n\n327\n00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:52.020\nThe refine edge tool, it's really good,\nit's kind of an advanced selection method,\n\n328\n00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.870\nbut it's advanced but it's easier,\nso it's pretty awesome.\n\n329\n00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:56.560\n>> Okay.\n\n330\n00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.500\n>> So, let's go to file, open.\n\n331\n00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:01.913\nI'm going to take this picture\nof this little puppy, Mei Mei.\n\n332\n00:18:01.913 --> 00:18:04.832\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So now, we have this dog and I kinda\n\n333\n00:18:04.832 --> 00:18:08.960\nwanna cut out the dog or I wanna just\nput the dog in a different background.\n\n334\n00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.500\nBut do you see these strands of hair?\n\n335\n00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.080\n>> That's gonna be a lot of work\nwith our normal selection tools.\n\n336\n00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.220\n>> That is going to be a ton of work, so\n>> Let's open up my layers.\n\n337\n00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.004\nLet's unlock this layer.\n\n338\n00:18:23.004 --> 00:18:24.390\nGood.\n\n339\n00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:29.140\nAnd then, let's create a background color.\n\n340\n00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.930\nI want the dog to be on\na black background, so\n\n341\n00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:36.190\nI'll select black as my\nPaint Bucket tool and I'll fill in.\n\n342\n00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:40.530\nYou see I was doing that behind\nthe current image just kind of you see how\n\n343\n00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:45.175\nlayers work you could edit the image below\nthe current one as long as it's selected.\n\n344\n00:18:45.175 --> 00:18:46.076\n>> [CROSSTALK] You can't see it.\n\n345\n00:18:46.076 --> 00:18:46.576\n>> Exactly.\n\n346\n00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:54.605\nSo now to do this I'll go to make\nthe selection as well as I can, at first.\n\n347\n00:18:54.605 --> 00:18:56.110\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So in this case,\n\n348\n00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.880\nI could use the magic wand tool.\n\n349\n00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:04.470\nI'll have to change the tolerance\ndown to probably 20.\n\n350\n00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:05.510\nLet's do 22.\n\n351\n00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:06.120\nMake a click.\n\n352\n00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:12.770\nRight here, it's selecting the multiple\ninstances of a dark color.\n\n353\n00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:19.900\nYou could see I have a setting\nenabled which is somewhere over here.\n\n354\n00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:23.229\nI do not see it.\n\n355\n00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:26.930\nHold on.\n\n356\n00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.130\nContinues, there it is.\n\n357\n00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.330\nUsually has a check box for\n\n358\n00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:38.070\nthe word continuous and it's a thumbnail\nnow...the things Photoshop does.\n\n359\n00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.840\nSo I'm going to click that.\n\n360\n00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.400\n>> Let me try it again.\nSo now, it's only selecting the touching\n\n361\n00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:49.310\ncolors rather than every color of that\npart of the spectrum in the image.\n\n362\n00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:53.310\nI'll click once, I'll hold shift and\nthen gonna add to my selection.\n\n363\n00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:54.450\nJust keep clicking around.\n\n364\n00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:59.200\nSo this is good, but then you see it's\nkind of selecting pieces of the dog.\n\n365\n00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.750\nNot very helpful for me.\n\n366\n00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:05.570\nSo, i'll continue just clicking away, and\n\n367\n00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:10.610\nthen here's a use case for the quick\nmess tool that we just learned about.\n\n368\n00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:15.355\nI'll press Q on the keyboard,\nnow you can see the dog is selected, or\n\n369\n00:20:15.355 --> 00:20:18.975\nthe dog is not selected in the case, I'm\nactually selecting the background first.\n\n370\n00:20:18.975 --> 00:20:26.115\nSo let me use my paint brush and\nremember black to conceal white to reveal.\n\n371\n00:20:26.115 --> 00:20:28.110\nSo the black.\n\n372\n00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.680\nTechnically, the dog is\nconcealed right now.\n\n373\n00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.750\nThat's how I want to keep it.\n\n374\n00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:35.470\nI accidentally just made a big\nold red mark on a quick mask.\n\n375\n00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:39.730\nI want to undo this, and\nthen change my color.\n\n376\n00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:40.268\nHold on, there.\n\n377\n00:20:40.268 --> 00:20:43.502\nUndo, there.\n\n378\n00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.040\nNow I want to change my color.\n\n379\n00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.570\nYou could use that by pressing x.\n\n380\n00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:54.970\nOn your keyboard to change the colours of\nyour right here [LAUGH] Yeah the colours.\n\n381\n00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.460\nSo I change my foreground colour\nto white and start painting.\n\n382\n00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:04.380\nSo now, I want to just get rid\nof all this stray hair for now.\n\n383\n00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.710\nThere, and then switch to black and\n\n384\n00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:14.210\nthen repaint the dog fully in so\nI don't miss a piece of her face.\n\n385\n00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:16.030\nAll right, so\n\n386\n00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:20.200\nnow that I have this selected I'll press\nQ again to show the marching ants there.\n\n387\n00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:25.130\nI want to go to Select > Refine edge.\n\n388\n00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:30.800\nIts also be done by control alt R or\ncommand option R on a Mac.\n\n389\n00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.850\nSo now I have all these settings.\n\n390\n00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:40.150\nThese settings can be manipulated to try\nto get the best quality image possible.\n\n391\n00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:44.670\nBut, it requires a lot of fiddling\nto get the perfect numbers and\n\n392\n00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.340\nin this case we'll do\nsomething called smart radius.\n\n393\n00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.100\n>> Which is great.\n\n394\n00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.090\nSo I'll click that.\n\n395\n00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:54.930\nAnd then, I will be able to start\npainting around the edge of this.\n\n396\n00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:56.410\nSo, let me change the view right here.\n\n397\n00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:00.340\nYou have options so,\nthe selection on white.\n\n398\n00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.635\nI can do it on black.\n\n399\n00:22:01.635 --> 00:22:04.685\nI can do overlay like we were\nused to with the quick mask.\n\n400\n00:22:04.685 --> 00:22:08.085\nMarching ants,\nwhich we've seen a lot as well.\n\n401\n00:22:08.085 --> 00:22:12.372\nThen you can do the really simple\nblack and white thing to the layers.\n\n402\n00:22:12.372 --> 00:22:15.690\nAnd Reveal Layer just shows\nexactly what's there.\n\n403\n00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:20.580\nFor this case, I'll do a overlay for\nnow just so we can see what's going on.\n\n404\n00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:25.010\nAnd I might switch to on black just so\nwe can see everything as it,\n\n405\n00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:30.040\nonce we start selecting things, refining\nthe selection, it'll be really obvious.\n\n406\n00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.350\n>> Okay.\n>> So let's do that.\n\n407\n00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:33.250\nClick that.\n\n408\n00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:39.210\nSo now, I want to make my brush size\nbigger with the square brackets.\n\n409\n00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.300\nThen I'll start painting along this.\n\n410\n00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.790\nJust kind of along the border for\nthe selection where the kind\n\n411\n00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:51.940\nof flyaways will happen, like the hair,\nthe split ends, the hair.\n\n412\n00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:56.801\nI'm just gonna keep going along the edge,\nand as I do this, it's erasing it and\n\n413\n00:22:56.801 --> 00:23:01.174\nthen filling it in smartly, so\nlet me kind of zoom in for you right here.\n\n414\n00:23:01.174 --> 00:23:04.790\nYou could see how-\n>> Wow, I can see where it's actually\n\n415\n00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:10.480\ngrabbed some of those individual hairs\n>> Exactly, yeah it's actually, sorry\n\n416\n00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.070\nabout that, yeah, it's actually selecting\nthe small hairs how small they are.\n\n417\n00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:17.430\nThe magic wand would\nnever have gotten that.\n\n418\n00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.300\n>> No.\n\n419\n00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.260\n>> So, it's good to have right there.\n\n420\n00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.910\n>> Or\nyou could spend hours with an eraser or\n\n421\n00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:23.590\nsomething trying to get\nthose little hairs.\n\n422\n00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.430\n>> Exactly, so,\nI'm trying to keep going over these,\n\n423\n00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:28.650\nmake sure they're captured properly.\n\n424\n00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.410\n>> So basically,\nit looks like its erasing it for\n\n425\n00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:37.530\na second but you're just telling Photoshop\nto take a closer look at this area and\n\n426\n00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:38.730\ndo a little more detailed work there.\n\n427\n00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:39.840\n>> Exactly.\n\n428\n00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.570\nAnd Photoshop is really\nsmart with this so,\n\n429\n00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.985\na few years ago that wasn't the case,\nbut now.\n\n430\n00:23:43.985 --> 00:23:46.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They've gotten much better.\n\n431\n00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.350\nSo now, it looks pretty good.\n\n432\n00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:52.402\nSo, I'm gonna hit, right down\nhere there is a bunch of options,\n\n433\n00:23:52.402 --> 00:23:56.760\noutput to Selection,\nLayer Mask, New Layer.\n\n434\n00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.338\nLet's do Layer Mask since it's related.\n\n435\n00:23:58.338 --> 00:23:58.939\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n436\n00:23:58.939 --> 00:24:01.120\n>> [LAUGH] Then I'll hit OK.\n\n437\n00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:07.640\nSo now, I have a layer mask with\nthe dog and the background.\n\n438\n00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.350\nBut it's kinda backwards.\n\n439\n00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.430\nLet's click on the layer mask, and\nbeing that I'm using black and\n\n440\n00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.630\nwhite here, I can inverse that.\n\n441\n00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:20.650\nSo on my keyboard, if I press Ctrl+I,\n\n442\n00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:23.600\nthat'll reverse that black and white.\n\n443\n00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.940\nSo now,\nwhat's concealed is now revealed and\n\n444\n00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.870\nnow the puppy is there\non the black background.\n\n445\n00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:35.070\nBut you can kind of see\nthere's a little area down\n\n446\n00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:38.340\nthere where there's a little bit.\n\n447\n00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.530\nIt did well, but not perfect.\n\n448\n00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:47.500\nWe can just simply use the A layer mask.\n\n449\n00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.410\nI want to conceal that.\n\n450\n00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:53.760\nSo, switch to black paintbrush.\n\n451\n00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.430\nAnd then make it small enough,\nand just go down.\n\n452\n00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.870\nThen, set the hardness to really soft,\nso it kind of eases you into it.\n\n453\n00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:03.652\nAnd just make a few little touch-ups,\nlike that.\n\n454\n00:25:03.652 --> 00:25:04.900\n>> Beautiful.\n\n455\n00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.370\nAnd then, up here too and that's about it.\n\n456\n00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.580\nSo, then, there we have our cutout puppy.\n\n457\n00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:14.380\nPerfect.\n\n458\n00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.060\n>> Fantastic.\n\n459\n00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.350\n>> Yeah\n>> All right, Nick,\n\n460\n00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.420\na lot of great information there when\nit comes to working with these masks,\n\n461\n00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:25.040\nboth layer masks and clipping mask and\n>> Some really cool ways that we can take\n\n462\n00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.270\nthat puppy and get him on his own picture\nand get rid of that background, right?\n\n463\n00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.950\nWe can put some other background in there.\n\n464\n00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:29.970\nSo, we thank you for that.\n\n465\n00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:32.140\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n466\n00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.360\nSigning off for IT Pro TV.\n\n467\n00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.700\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n468\n00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:35.490\n>> And I'm Nick Paige.\n\n469\n00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:37.289\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n470\n00:25:37.289 --> 00:25:45.400\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.100\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.580\nAnd today we're doing\nAdobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.410\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nit's time for\n\n6\n00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.610\nanother one of those exciting,\ntry it out exercises.\n\n7\n00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.540\nAnd here with us today, is Mr. Nick Page.\n\n8\n00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.320\nHow you doing, Nick?\n\n9\n00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.190\n>> Pretty good.\nI'm ready to try it out with these\n\n10\n00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.548\nclipping masks and layers masks.\n\n11\n00:00:32.548 --> 00:00:33.066\n>> All right.\n\n12\n00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.080\n>> So let's dive into Photoshop here.\n\n13\n00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.660\nAnd I'm gonna start by\nopening a project file.\n\n14\n00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.430\nSo let's go to file, open right here,\nand then let's open sunflower three.\n\n15\n00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.330\nSo here we have sunflower three,\nlooks rather nice, so\n\n16\n00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.260\nfirst off let's make it\nlook a little nicer.\n\n17\n00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.020\n>> All right.\n\n18\n00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.160\n>> Layers,\nI will unlock the layer, and then.\n\n19\n00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.860\nLet's go to create a layer style up here.\n\n20\n00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.860\nClick that.\n\n21\n00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.530\nAnd then let's do the,\nwhat do I want to do?\n\n22\n00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.660\nLet's mess with some Vibrance.\n\n23\n00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.450\nAdjust that up there,\nmake it much yellower, saturate it more,\n\n24\n00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.519\nadd some more orange to it.\n\n25\n00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.610\nAnd then there we go.\n\n26\n00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.400\nSo now we have a Vibrance layer on there.\n\n27\n00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.110\nI could also take it off if I wanted\nto if I didn't like it too much.\n\n28\n00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.640\nOr I could adjust it further, later.\n\n29\n00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.070\nSo we have this.\n\n30\n00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.200\nNow let's create a cool design thing.\n\n31\n00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.330\nIt's kind of more modern.\n\n32\n00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.800\nI've noticed that everyone is kind of, or\n\n33\n00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.950\na lot of companies seem\nto be into more shapes.\n\n34\n00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.886\n>> Mm hm.\n\n35\n00:01:43.886 --> 00:01:46.853\n>> I see a lot of hexagon stuff,\nlet's do a hexagon.\n\n36\n00:01:46.853 --> 00:01:47.451\n>> Okay.\n>> I want to create a hexagon.\n\n37\n00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:50.622\nDown at the bottom left,\ndown on the left on your tools section,\n\n38\n00:01:50.622 --> 00:01:51.810\nthere's a shape tool.\n\n39\n00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.200\nIt'd probably be rectangle tool or\ncustom shaped tool.\n\n40\n00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.390\nI'm going to go to polygon.\n\n41\n00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.580\nHere I can adjust the size,\nthe sides of it.\n\n42\n00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.010\nSo it's default is set to five, I believe.\n\n43\n00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.918\nSo it's a pentagon.\n\n44\n00:02:05.918 --> 00:02:07.960\nPentagon?\nYeah, so I want to switch to six,\n\n45\n00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.675\nso hexagon.\n\n46\n00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:11.020\n>> Okay.\n>> So there you go, six right up here.\n\n47\n00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.430\nAnd then let's draw one.\n\n48\n00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.380\nI'll just draw one in.\n\n49\n00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.990\nI'll hold shift and\ndrag out to the right to keep it the same.\n\n50\n00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.220\nTo keep it a consistent size.\n\n51\n00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.030\nAnd then here's my hexagon.\n\n52\n00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.500\nNow I'll create more of these so\nbe artsy about this.\n\n53\n00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.310\nTo duplicate I'll hold alt and\n\n54\n00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.050\nthen make sure I am on my move tool,\nhold alt and click and drag.\n\n55\n00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.610\nThere I have another one,\nthen do it one more time.\n\n56\n00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.470\nSo there are three hexagons there.\n\n57\n00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.230\nWhat am I going to do with this?\n\n58\n00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.710\nI kind of want to create\na clipping mask now.\n\n59\n00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.030\nSo let's go,drag these below so\n\n60\n00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.380\nmy picture that I want to clip is above\nthose shapes and then I'll right click.\n\n61\n00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.280\nCreate Clipping Mask.\n\n62\n00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.570\nSo now, what just happened?\n\n63\n00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.040\nYou see, it only happened to one of those,\nyou can only see, there's one of\n\n64\n00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.586\nthe polygons that actually got [CROSSTALK]\n>> Just the one layer that was directly\n\n65\n00:03:11.586 --> 00:03:12.462\nbelow your image.\n\n66\n00:03:12.462 --> 00:03:14.778\n>> Exactly.\n\n67\n00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:18.070\nSo, to kind of fix this,\nI want all three of them to be there.\n\n68\n00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.860\nSo, what I'll do is, I will actually take\nthese three, click on the first one.\n\n69\n00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.650\nHold your Shift button and\nclick on the last one.\n\n70\n00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.700\nSo now all three are selected.\n\n71\n00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.240\nI'm gonna put these in a group.\n\n72\n00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.640\nSo then it's one group object\nbelow that clipping mask, so\n\n73\n00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.700\nit'll still be the object directly below,\nexcept it'll have more objects in it.\n\n74\n00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.540\nSo easy way to do this,\nmake sure they're all highlighted,\n\n75\n00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.840\nclick them,\ndrag them onto the folder down here.\n\n76\n00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.750\nNow I have a group.\n\n77\n00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.990\nSo now this happened.\n\n78\n00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.840\nIt kind of brought my\nclipping mask in with it.\n\n79\n00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.550\nSo it's a good practice to group\nthem first and then clip it.\n\n80\n00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.330\nSo I'll just pull this clipping\nmask out of the group right there.\n\n81\n00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.380\nAnd then reclip it.\n\n82\n00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.000\nSo now if I do right click,\nclipping mask, now they're all selected.\n\n83\n00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.760\n>> Perfect.\n\n84\n00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.730\n>> So now I have this really cool design.\n\n85\n00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.860\nI could either change the positioning\nof the sunflower there, or\n\n86\n00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.180\nI can change the positioning\nof the hexagons.\n\n87\n00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.230\nSo whatever looks really cool to me.\n\n88\n00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.670\nLet me just put these down here,\non the bottom left,\n\n89\n00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.960\nthen move my picture so\nkind of works like that.\n\n90\n00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.260\nLet's get a good part of the picture.\n\n91\n00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.350\nI guess that's good for now.\n\n92\n00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.094\nSo now, I want to create a,\nlet's create like a white background, or\n\n93\n00:04:37.094 --> 00:04:40.950\na color background actually,\nso, I'll create a new layer.\n\n94\n00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.340\nAnd then still want it\nto be in the background,\n\n95\n00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.920\nI'll drag it all way to the bottom so\nit's behind all the other ones.\n\n96\n00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:54.710\nAnd a way to nondestructively add a fill\nof colors, it's really simple actually,\n\n97\n00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.350\ninstead of taking my paint bucket tool\nI'm just like filling it with black.\n\n98\n00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:07.900\nI can actually go to down to the bottom\nhere where I'll do the layer styles.\n\n99\n00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.890\nAnd I could actually go to, what was it?\n\n100\n00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.991\nSolid Color or Gradient, but if I click\nthat, it'll give me an option for\n\n101\n00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:17.500\na solid color,\nlet's make a big old red background.\n\n102\n00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.750\nHit OK.\n\n103\n00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.870\nSo now this is a,\nit has a layer mask on that layer so\n\n104\n00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.470\nif I wanted to add things to it before\nI can actually adjust this further by\n\n105\n00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.049\npainting black or white.\n\n106\n00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.720\nTo kind of erase part of\nthe color background,\n\n107\n00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.830\neven though I'm not really erasing it.\n\n108\n00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.140\nSo, let me undo that,\nleave the solid for now.\n\n109\n00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.070\nAnd then say if I, there we go,\nkeep going back, there.\n\n110\n00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.590\nSo, say if I have these three hexagons\nthere, I don't want all three of them.\n\n111\n00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.070\nAnd like to be part of the flower.\n\n112\n00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.140\nSo if I wanted to I could\nopen this group up, and\n\n113\n00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.830\nthen pull one of these out of the group\nif I wanted to no longer clip.\n\n114\n00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.840\nSo let me pull this polygon\nout of the group down below.\n\n115\n00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.190\nAnd it's no longer part\nof that clipping mask.\n\n116\n00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.780\nSame goes the other way.\n\n117\n00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.100\nIf I wanted to re-add it, there we go.\n\n118\n00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.140\nAnd I could also, let me create\na picture or create another shape.\n\n119\n00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.520\nLet me do a big one.\n\n120\n00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.380\nLet's do it that way, just like that.\n\n121\n00:06:30.802 --> 00:06:34.030\nThis one, not look as good\nbecause we'll have to see.\n\n122\n00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.546\nThere so I can add another one to it,\nor I can take it out.\n\n123\n00:06:38.546 --> 00:06:41.757\nTake it out.\n\n124\n00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.496\nSometimes it's difficult removing things\nfrom the folder cuz you have to get right\n\n125\n00:06:48.496 --> 00:06:50.060\noutside of the little barrier.\n\n126\n00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.330\n>> Especially down there at the bottom.\n\n127\n00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.360\n>> Right, mm-hm.\n\n128\n00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.140\nSo now this one, it kinda thinks that it\nshould be a part of the clipping mask.\n\n129\n00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.680\nIf you drag it up out of the thing.\n\n130\n00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.400\nSo that can easily be fixed if you just\nkeep dragging it up, or right click on it.\n\n131\n00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.260\nAnd you can release clipping mask,\nthat's a way too.\n\n132\n00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:15.640\nSay I didn't want this flower to be\na clipping mask anymore, right click it,\n\n133\n00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.610\nor right click the name.\n\n134\n00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.800\nRelease clicking mask so\nit'll just be there.\n\n135\n00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.240\nSo now let me pull this back and\nmake this look good.\n\n136\n00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.360\nI'll pull this back into the group.\n\n137\n00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.920\nAnd then let's move this flower around so\nit actually, there we go.\n\n138\n00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.895\nSo now it all kind of melts together.\n\n139\n00:07:32.895 --> 00:07:37.430\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And that's just a basic kind of\n\n140\n00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.440\nintro to the clipping masks and\nyou can be really creative with this,\n\n141\n00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.810\nyou can do same thing with text.\n\n142\n00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:47.430\nSay if I wanted to have a text\nhave the sunflower background\n\n143\n00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.680\nsame thing as I would with the shapes\nI just use a text layer instead.\n\n144\n00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.620\n>> Very cool Nick.\n\n145\n00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.604\nI tell you what, it makes you think about\nsome of those images I've seen out there\n\n146\n00:07:54.604 --> 00:07:58.085\nand realize wait, I bet ya they're\nusing some type of layer mask or\n\n147\n00:07:58.085 --> 00:07:59.465\na clipping mask on that.\n\n148\n00:07:59.465 --> 00:08:00.045\nSo very cool.\n\n149\n00:08:00.045 --> 00:08:02.765\nNow we can start to make some\nprofessional looking graphics.\n\n150\n00:08:02.765 --> 00:08:03.505\nAppreciate that.\n\n151\n00:08:03.505 --> 00:08:05.165\nHope everybody out there enjoyed it.\n\n152\n00:08:05.165 --> 00:08:07.455\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrik.\n\n153\n00:08:07.455 --> 00:08:08.215\n>> And I'm Nick Page.\n\n154\n00:08:08.215 --> 00:08:10.121\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n155\n00:08:10.121 --> 00:08:18.139\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Welcome to another exciting\nepisode here at IT PRO TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.440\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.890\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at typography.\n\n5\n00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.720\nNot one of the first things\nthat comes to mind, maybe,\n\n6\n00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.430\nwhen you think about Photoshopping\nworking with photos.\n\n7\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.770\nBut as we get into our more complex\nprojects we definitely got to bring some\n\n8\n00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.400\ntype in there.\n\n9\n00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.030\nSo, to help us with that here we have Ms.\nKara Page.\n\n10\n00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.060\nHow you doing, Kara?\n\n11\n00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.630\n>> I'm great.\nYou ready to start playing around\n\n12\n00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.010\nwith some text and Photoshop?\n\n13\n00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.240\n>> I am ready.\n\n14\n00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.930\n>> All right.\n\n15\n00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.510\nSo, let's get Photoshop up and running.\n\n16\n00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.370\nAnd we are going to just\nopen a blank document.\n\n17\n00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.980\nSo go to File > New or click New, and\nI'm going to change it to US Paper.\n\n18\n00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.190\nWe are going to pretend like we're\nmaking something for prints.\n\n19\n00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.810\nIt maybe a resume or an advertisement.\n\n20\n00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.400\nSo I'm going to make sure it\nsays eight and a half by 11,\n\n21\n00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.170\n300 CMIK, White background.\n\n22\n00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.640\nSo long as all that checks out we\nare good to go so go ahead and click OK.\n\n23\n00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.660\nSo the whole little lecture we're giving\ntoday is devoted to the Type Tool,\n\n24\n00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.270\nthe little T in your toolbar.\n\n25\n00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.480\nSo let's find that first and\nwe're gonna talk about it.\n\n26\n00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.340\nSo the T is over on the left.\n\n27\n00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.690\nIf you click on it, you'll notice that\nnow we have a tool options bar that has\n\n28\n00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.940\nall of these different options.\n\n29\n00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.020\nSo you'll see your defaulted font here.\n\n30\n00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.890\nIf you click on the drop down here,\n\n31\n00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.030\nyou'll see all the different fonts\navailable to you in Photoshop.\n\n32\n00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.590\nNow I download a lot of fonts so\n\n33\n00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.980\nyou probably aren't going to have this\nmany fonts, I really really love fonts.\n\n34\n00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.020\nFonts, I download them all the time.\n\n35\n00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.450\nYou can also add fonts with Adobe Typekit,\nso\n\n36\n00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.360\nyou'll notice that you have that\nlittle option in the corner.\n\n37\n00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.530\nSo you can definitely do that.\n\n38\n00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.150\nYou can add fonts from there.\n\n39\n00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.900\nYou can also download fonts online.\n\n40\n00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.880\nThere are tons and tons of websites\navailable for you for fonts.\n\n41\n00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.140\nBy telling you, once you start doing it,\nit's like you go down a rabbit hole and\n\n42\n00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.860\nyou just download, download, download.\n\n43\n00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.260\nI might download 25 fonts in a day.\n\n44\n00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.220\nWow.\n>> You just keep finding more and\n\n45\n00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.860\nmore fonts.\n\n46\n00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.300\nBut when you do that, make sure to\npay attention to their licenses.\n\n47\n00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.890\nSo that goes back to our\nlittle copyright lecture.\n\n48\n00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.060\nSo you'll notice with every\nfont that you have to download,\n\n49\n00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.170\nit'll tell you how you can use it.\n\n50\n00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.310\nIt'll say free for personal use,\n100% free, small donation.\n\n51\n00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.890\nSo, pay attention to what\nthe artist requests for\n\n52\n00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.000\ntheir font before you download and\nuse in a commercial piece, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.680\nSo pretty much all of them are free for\n\n54\n00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.060\npersonal use if you find them\non a main typography website.\n\n55\n00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.640\nBut do note that you don't want to use\nthat same font in a commercial case\n\n56\n00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.410\nwithout paying the artist for it.\n\n57\n00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.780\nOkay, so now that we've gotten\nthe legality out of the way,\n\n58\n00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.850\nLet's pick a font to play with.\n\n59\n00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.960\nI'm actually going to pick\none that I did download.\n\n60\n00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.510\nIt's called Davis New.\n\n61\n00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.180\nIt's 100% free.\n\n62\n00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.875\nIf you find it on one of the font websites\nyou'll see that it gets downloaded about\n\n63\n00:03:02.875 --> 00:03:04.310\n12,000 times a day.\n\n64\n00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.210\n>> Wow.\n>> It's extremely popular\n\n65\n00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.250\nbecause it's very clean and easy to read.\n\n66\n00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.230\nSo let's select that.\n\n67\n00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.170\nYou'll notice also, before I select it,\nit'll show you previews of the font, so\n\n68\n00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.230\nthat way you're not guessing,\n\n69\n00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.030\nokay what in the world does Miriad Pro\nlook like versus Baskerville versus Alora.\n\n70\n00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.740\nYou know, you don't have to\nknow their personalities.\n\n71\n00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.280\n>> Nice.\n>> Okay, you can see them here.\n\n72\n00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.720\nYou can also change this\ndefault size as well.\n\n73\n00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.750\nYou can edit that size.\n\n74\n00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.990\nIf you want it to be larger,\nyou we certainly can make it larger.\n\n75\n00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.980\nSo let's select out font.\n\n76\n00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.650\nWe're gonna select Bebas Neue, and then\nif it were a font that had options like\n\n77\n00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.010\nregular bold, italicized, they would be\nright here where my regular is grayed out.\n\n78\n00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.780\nSo let me show you what would happen if\nwe picked something like, let's choose,\n\n79\n00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.610\nI don't know, Ariel.\n\n80\n00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.290\nNice Ariel, you'll see how bold, regular\nitalic, bold italic are there for you.\n\n81\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.590\nOkay, I am gonna go back to\nBebas just cuz it's nice to see.\n\n82\n00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.350\nThe nice thing about Photoshop and\nAdobe products in general is,\n\n83\n00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.120\nthey show you your most\nrecent fonts up at the top.\n\n84\n00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.640\nSo, I didn't have to scroll\nall the way to Bebas or\n\n85\n00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.880\nI didn't have to type in Bebas,\nI just clicked on it.\n\n86\n00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.500\n>> That, very importantly, when you're\na font collector, like you are.\n\n87\n00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.775\nYou got a list of 2000 fonts.\n\n88\n00:04:11.775 --> 00:04:14.220\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n89\n00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.500\nSo, I am going to see,\nnow that what my font size is so\n\n90\n00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.550\nyou'll notice that it's 12 pt so\n12 point font.\n\n91\n00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.710\nYou can click on the drop-down to select a\nsize or you can type your size yourself so\n\n92\n00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.310\nif you didn't want it to be\n12 you can make it larger.\n\n93\n00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.010\nSo, let's try making ours,\nlet's do a nice 50, okay?\n\n94\n00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.350\nI'm going to hit enter to commit that.\n\n95\n00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.870\nThe next thing you'll see is\nsomething that say smooth.\n\n96\n00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.320\nSo, you'll have smooth,\nstrong, crisp, none, sharp.\n\n97\n00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.520\nThis is called anti-aliasing.\n\n98\n00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.210\nSo anti-aliasing changes\nhow sharp the word looks.\n\n99\n00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.650\nSo let's practice that.\n\n100\n00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.790\nNow if I were to type right now,\n\n101\n00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.080\nyou wouldn't be able to see\nit because my color is white.\n\n102\n00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.160\nOkay?\nSo let's change the color.\n\n103\n00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.780\nI'm going to just pick a nice black\nhere for you and let's type, practice.\n\n104\n00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.560\nOkay.\n\n105\n00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.200\nI'm moving it with the move tool.\n\n106\n00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.570\nNow, to get my text options back,\nI need to select my type tool.\n\n107\n00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.460\nI'm going to zoom into this so\nyou can see it a lot better.\n\n108\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.080\nAnd I'm going to pan using my spacebar.\n\n109\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.200\nAnd there we go,\nit brings up our hand tools.\n\n110\n00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.780\nSo now you can see practice pretty well.\n\n111\n00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.040\nI'm gonna make this font even larger\nthan it is so let's take it up to 100.\n\n112\n00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.380\nThere we go, nice and large.\n\n113\n00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.260\nThere's practice for us.\n\n114\n00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.330\nFold highlight and see what happens if\nwe were to choose a different option.\n\n115\n00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.466\nSo let's look at strong.\n\n116\n00:05:40.317 --> 00:05:44.300\nStrong, okay,\nwe're looking along the edges of.\n\n117\n00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.120\nThe letter.\nSo, let's look at sharp.\n\n118\n00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.250\nYou'll notice that it tightens\nup just a little bit.\n\n119\n00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.070\nCrisp, smooth,\nthey all do slightly different things.\n\n120\n00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.600\nSo, if you're having issues\nwith- Let's say you're making\n\n121\n00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.800\na banner advertisement at 72, Pixels.\n\n122\n00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.980\nThen it might look a little pixellated,\nthe font.\n\n123\n00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.830\nSo you would play around with\nthese anti aliasing methods\n\n124\n00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.380\nto make it look more smooth.\n\n125\n00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.020\nOr crisp.\n\n126\n00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.580\nOr strong.\n\n127\n00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.200\nDepending on your font.\n\n128\n00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.160\nNow Davis is one that looks good\npretty much no matter what.\n\n129\n00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.660\nSo let's try changing it\nto something like Arial.\n\n130\n00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.230\nJust to see the difference.\n\n131\n00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.220\nLet's change it to Arial Bold and see\nif we get more of a change here at all.\n\n132\n00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.720\nSo.\n\n133\n00:06:26.109 --> 00:06:27.295\nOf course, I picked two fonts.\n\n134\n00:06:27.295 --> 00:06:29.510\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That just a pretty good, there.\n\n135\n00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.000\nSo, let's look at this,\nlet's look at none.\n\n136\n00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.760\nSo none if we zoom in to the C,\n\n137\n00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.525\nyou'll notice that is have\na very pixellated edge.\n\n138\n00:06:36.525 --> 00:06:37.340\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n139\n00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.220\n>> That's not what we want.\n\n140\n00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.460\nSo let's compare that to sharp.\n\n141\n00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.370\nFor sharp smooths it out ever so slightly.\n\n142\n00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.650\nCrisp, very similar.\n\n143\n00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.210\nStrong.\n\n144\n00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.330\nAnd then you have your smooth.\n\n145\n00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:55.170\nOkay, so find what works best for\nyour font and go about that way.\n\n146\n00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.500\nAlright so you'll also notice along the\ntop that we have alignment options too.\n\n147\n00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.820\nSo we have left align,\ncenter align and right align.\n\n148\n00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.840\nSo if you were to click on left align,\nit will left align but\n\n149\n00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.890\nyou might have to drag it back over.\n\n150\n00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.120\nNow it's just a single line of text so\n\n151\n00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.770\nreally aligning with a single\nline is kind of silly.\n\n152\n00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.030\nBut if I have more text\nIt might be helpful.\n\n153\n00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.310\nLet's say that I wanted to\nhighlight my text again.\n\n154\n00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.490\nSo I wanted io edit it and\nchange my font maybe.\n\n155\n00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.790\nThere are several ways to do it.\n\n156\n00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:29.050\nYou can click on your type tool and\nhighlight it or you could do my favorite\n\n157\n00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.545\nmethod which is to go to your Layers\npanel and double-click on the text T.\n\n158\n00:07:32.545 --> 00:07:35.750\nDouble-clicking on the T\nselects everything.\n\n159\n00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.979\nThe problem with using\nthe type tool to select,\n\n160\n00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:40.720\nis it's very easy to accidentally\nstart a new text layer.\n\n161\n00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.364\n[LAUGH] So you have to be very\nexact with where you're clicking,\n\n162\n00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:48.298\nthis takes away that margin of\nerror by double-clicking on your T.\n\n163\n00:07:48.298 --> 00:07:54.148\nYou'll also notice that when you do create\ntext, it automatically names your layer.\n\n164\n00:07:54.148 --> 00:07:56.376\nWhatever your text says.\n\n165\n00:07:56.376 --> 00:07:59.922\nSo it kind of saves you from doing that\nlayer organization that we went over much\n\n166\n00:07:59.922 --> 00:08:00.520\nearlier on.\n\n167\n00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.983\nYou don't have to go back and\nrename, very helpful.\n\n168\n00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:07.600\nOkay, so\nthat's just your basic line of text.\n\n169\n00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.737\nSo let's say that we wanted\nto add a different line, and\n\n170\n00:08:09.737 --> 00:08:10.990\nwe wanted to change the font.\n\n171\n00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.030\nWhat we could do is we could go to our\nText Tool, click somewhere that's away\n\n172\n00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:19.830\nfrom your top PRACTICE, and\nI'm gonna change the font over here.\n\n173\n00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:24.168\nLet's change it to, I don't know.\n\n174\n00:08:24.168 --> 00:08:28.950\nLet's go to, we'll do Arial Bold,\njust so you can see, Bold Italic,\n\n175\n00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.660\nactually, so\nwe can really see a difference.\n\n176\n00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.789\nI'm gonna change this to be 30.\n\n177\n00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:40.460\nI'll change it to be this nice little\nblue color, and now I'll write something.\n\n178\n00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.730\nSo let's do, This is fun!\n\n179\n00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.920\nOkay, so there, now I have this.\n\n180\n00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.600\nIf I wanted to change maybe\nthe spacing of my letters, or\n\n181\n00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.260\nI wanted to change the distance\nbetween lines, so let's see.\n\n182\n00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.093\nThis is another line.\n\n183\n00:08:56.093 --> 00:09:00.130\nNow I need to pull up my panel that\nallows me to do additional edits.\n\n184\n00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.960\nSo to do that,\nyou can click on this little folder icon.\n\n185\n00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.820\nThis folder is the toggle to your\ncharacter or paragraph panels.\n\n186\n00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.060\nSo you can click on it here,\nor you can go to Window, and\n\n187\n00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.960\nselect Character or\nParagraph there as well.\n\n188\n00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.230\nI think it's a lot easier to\njust click on this fly out menu.\n\n189\n00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.851\nSo when you do, you'll notice that we\nhave this little box that appears.\n\n190\n00:09:22.851 --> 00:09:27.531\nAnd you'll notice we have the font here,\nthe type here, so bold,\n\n191\n00:09:27.531 --> 00:09:30.020\nitalic, whatever, the size.\n\n192\n00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.935\nAnd then you have this\nthing that says Auto.\n\n193\n00:09:31.935 --> 00:09:37.140\nNow if you hover over each of these little\nicons, it'll tell you what it does.\n\n194\n00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.370\nSo this A stacked on top of the A,\nthis is something called leading.\n\n195\n00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:47.950\nLeading, which looks like leading,\nL-E-A-D-I-N-G, is the space between lines.\n\n196\n00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:51.090\nSo if we wanted to change\nthe space between these two lines,\n\n197\n00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.260\nwe could highlight our text.\n\n198\n00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.840\nAnd right now, it's set to Auto,\nwhich basically means that the font\n\n199\n00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.830\nautomatically knows how\nfar apart it should be.\n\n200\n00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.160\nBut let's say that we didn't like that,\nand we wanted to change it.\n\n201\n00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.350\nLet's see what were to\nhappen if we did 10 points.\n\n202\n00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:10.120\nThere, and now you'll notice that our\nlines are stacked on top of each other.\n\n203\n00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.443\nThat's not ideal, let's try 30.\n\n204\n00:10:13.443 --> 00:10:18.424\n30 is very similar to what we had\noriginally, and then let's try 60.\n\n205\n00:10:18.424 --> 00:10:20.740\nSo you'll notice we're\nadding line spacing.\n\n206\n00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.697\nIt's kind of similar to Microsoft Word,\nwhere you add double spacing or one and\n\n207\n00:10:24.697 --> 00:10:26.894\na half spacing, but you have more options.\n\n208\n00:10:26.894 --> 00:10:30.364\nOkay, so I'm gonna change it back to Auto,\ncuz Auto actually looks pretty good for\n\n209\n00:10:30.364 --> 00:10:30.870\nthis font.\n\n210\n00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.010\nThen we have down here, this V and this A.\n\n211\n00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:39.110\nSo if we hover over it, it'll say\nthat you're setting the tracking.\n\n212\n00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.770\nThe tracking is the spacing\nbetween all letters.\n\n213\n00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:46.160\nSo, let's see what would happen if we\nchanged it from something other than 0.\n\n214\n00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.139\nLet's try -50 first.\n\n215\n00:10:49.182 --> 00:10:53.292\nSo -50 just pulled all the letters\nslightly closer together.\n\n216\n00:10:53.292 --> 00:10:58.507\nAll right, so let's try the other\ndirection, let's try 200.\n\n217\n00:10:58.507 --> 00:11:02.110\nNow all of our letters are evenly\nspaced throughout the line,\n\n218\n00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.750\nwhich is great, but\nthis is very spread out.\n\n219\n00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:05.940\nI don't really like what this looks like.\n\n220\n00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.950\nSo let's just go back to 0,\nwhich is what its default is, okay.\n\n221\n00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:15.420\nLet's say that we wanted to maybe\nchange how close this N and O were.\n\n222\n00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:19.830\nSo if you wanted to do something more\nspecific, that would be kerning.\n\n223\n00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.428\nSo kerning is this V-A.\n\n224\n00:11:22.428 --> 00:11:25.820\nYou'll notice that it's set to metrics or\noptical.\n\n225\n00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.780\nYou can change this.\n\n226\n00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.450\nAnd you can edit your text.\n\n227\n00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.890\nSo just two letters are closer together,\none letter is closer to the other.\n\n228\n00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:35.920\nThat's available for you.\n\n229\n00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.540\nThen you have this T with\nthe tall double arrow.\n\n230\n00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.000\nThis is vertical scale.\n\n231\n00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.790\nSo if we were to change\nthe scale vertically,\n\n232\n00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:47.519\nlet's see what would\nhappen if we put in 300%.\n\n233\n00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:50.340\nIt'd help if I highlighted my text.\n\n234\n00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:57.730\nHold on, let's highlight you,\nand let's change you to 300%.\n\n235\n00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.429\nOkay, that looks a little\nbit distorted because we\n\n236\n00:12:00.429 --> 00:12:03.820\nvertically scaled it three\ntimes larger than what it was.\n\n237\n00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.070\nThat doesn't look great, but if you were\ntrying to do that, if you're trying to\n\n238\n00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:10.990\ncreate some kind of word art where\nyou needed to do that, you could.\n\n239\n00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.445\nYou'd probably just wanna go back and\nchange your leading.\n\n240\n00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.010\nYou can also type in your leading here.\n\n241\n00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:19.630\nSo I'm gonna change it to, let's do 200.\n\n242\n00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.470\nNow they're really spread out.\n\n243\n00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.562\nBut it looks better cuz they're\nnot stacked on top of each other.\n\n244\n00:12:23.562 --> 00:12:28.760\n[LAUGH] All right, let's go back\nto our default there of 100 and\n\n245\n00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.847\nour default of Auto here.\n\n246\n00:12:30.847 --> 00:12:34.698\nOkay, this next T, where the arrows\nare pointing horizontally,\n\n247\n00:12:34.698 --> 00:12:37.110\nthat's your horizontal scale.\n\n248\n00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:43.252\nSo let's see what would happen if we\ndid 200% there, scales it horizontally.\n\n249\n00:12:43.252 --> 00:12:45.230\nHere, go back to 100.\n\n250\n00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:49.150\nAll right, this next one right\nhere is the baseline shift.\n\n251\n00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.170\nSo if you wanted to change\nhow a certain letter looked,\n\n252\n00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:56.610\nlet's say that you're doing something like\nH2O, so you're dealing with chemistry.\n\n253\n00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:00.550\nYou can highlight a letter and\nchange the baseline.\n\n254\n00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.864\nLet's do -20.\n\n255\n00:13:03.864 --> 00:13:07.090\nYou'll notice that now my s is by itself.\n\n256\n00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.260\nIt's kind of hanging down there.\n\n257\n00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.380\nLet's see what would happen\nif we did positive 20.\n\n258\n00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.020\nSo, let's say that you were doing math,\nand you were typing out math equations,\n\n259\n00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.750\nand you need to do x squared.\n\n260\n00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.210\nThis is how you would\nadjust that baseline.\n\n261\n00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.795\n>> Very nice.\n\n262\n00:13:20.795 --> 00:13:23.790\n>> Okay, so, let's just go back to 0 for\n\n263\n00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.630\nthat so\n[LAUGH] it looks just like everybody else.\n\n264\n00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:29.780\nIf you wanted to change the color, you can\nhighlight each letter individually, or\n\n265\n00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.080\nyou can select everything at once or\none line.\n\n266\n00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.902\nSo let's just change this one line.\n\n267\n00:13:33.902 --> 00:13:37.920\nI'm gonna use our lovely color picker,\nand I'll just choose a green.\n\n268\n00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.360\nClick OK.\n\n269\n00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.450\nSo now we have two lines of text.\n\n270\n00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:44.430\nWith these lines of text, we can\nalso play around with alignment now.\n\n271\n00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.581\nSo we can highlight the whole thing.\n\n272\n00:13:46.581 --> 00:13:51.612\nYou can also do Cmd+A or Ctrl+A, as long\nas you have your type tool selected.\n\n273\n00:13:51.612 --> 00:13:53.810\nAnd let's do Center Align.\n\n274\n00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.070\nNow as you drag this over,\nyou'll notice that a purple line appears.\n\n275\n00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:04.107\nThis purple line in the middle is a guide\ntelling you you've hit the center of\n\n276\n00:14:04.107 --> 00:14:04.745\nyour page.\n\n277\n00:14:04.745 --> 00:14:09.490\nSo if you wanted everything to be center\naligned, this is where you would go, okay.\n\n278\n00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.680\nSo beyond that,\nwe have additional options available.\n\n279\n00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:17.030\nSo this whole line here,\nthey all do different things.\n\n280\n00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:21.637\nIf you hover over them, this is for\nbold, for italic, all caps.\n\n281\n00:14:21.637 --> 00:14:25.327\nSo let's say that you wanted to change\nsomething to all caps because you think\n\n282\n00:14:25.327 --> 00:14:29.129\nit's easier to read, instead of typing\nthe whole thing out again in Caps Lock,\n\n283\n00:14:29.129 --> 00:14:32.516\nyou could just click the two tall Ts,\nautomatically changes for you.\n\n284\n00:14:32.516 --> 00:14:33.660\n>> Very nice.\n\n285\n00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.455\n>> You can also add small caps,\nsuperscript, subscripts,\n\n286\n00:14:37.455 --> 00:14:39.473\nunderline, strike through.\n\n287\n00:14:39.473 --> 00:14:43.472\nThey're all there for you as options,\nso it's up to you to explore them,\n\n288\n00:14:43.472 --> 00:14:44.900\nfigure out what you like.\n\n289\n00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:50.940\nOkay, so now that we've created some\nbasic text, let's work with styles.\n\n290\n00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.320\nSo for\nthose of you who have ever used InDesign,\n\n291\n00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.580\nyou're probably familiar with\ncharacter and paragraph styles.\n\n292\n00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:02.140\nSo let's test that out, let's go ahead and\ncreate some kind of header.\n\n293\n00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.280\nSo I'm gonna type in header.\n\n294\n00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:08.520\nI'm gonna make it, well,\nlet's do it kind of bright pink.\n\n295\n00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:14.630\nI'm gonna change the text to\nthis Arial Black Regular.\n\n296\n00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.093\nI'll make it 60.\n\n297\n00:15:19.017 --> 00:15:23.711\nSo now we have this header, which is\ngreat, but I wanna be able to apply\n\n298\n00:15:23.711 --> 00:15:28.310\nthis same character style to\nother words on my document.\n\n299\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.700\nSo what I'll do is I'll make sure\nthat my text is selected, and\n\n300\n00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.100\nI'll go up to Window > Character Styles.\n\n301\n00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.650\nNow you'll notice there's\na None with a + next to it.\n\n302\n00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:42.790\nThe + is telling you that you've made\nsome modifications from the default.\n\n303\n00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:46.450\nSo let's say that I wanted to create\na layer style based on what I did\n\n304\n00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:47.510\non my document.\n\n305\n00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.500\nI would click on this little button that\nlooks like our New Layer button, but\n\n306\n00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.950\nit's a new character style.\n\n307\n00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.735\nSo let's click that.\n\n308\n00:15:54.735 --> 00:16:00.601\nAnd I'm going to name it by double\nclicking, I'm gonna put header.\n\n309\n00:16:00.601 --> 00:16:03.593\nNow you'll notice that it saved all\nthat information you already put.\n\n310\n00:16:03.593 --> 00:16:07.820\nPut in Photoshop so it has your font\nfamily, your font size, your colour.\n\n311\n00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.700\nAll of that is here and\nit automatically knows.\n\n312\n00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.390\nSo you can click.\n\n313\n00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:16.390\nOkay, so\nnow we have a header style selected.\n\n314\n00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:20.535\nLet's say we wanted to adjust\none of our other layers of type.\n\n315\n00:16:20.535 --> 00:16:24.025\nWe want it to take practice now and\nchange it to header.\n\n316\n00:16:25.425 --> 00:16:29.745\nYou can click header, commit.\n\n317\n00:16:29.745 --> 00:16:32.396\nBut see, the way that I did that\nit automatically said, okay,\n\n318\n00:16:32.396 --> 00:16:34.095\nyou're changing this one to that one.\n\n319\n00:16:34.095 --> 00:16:35.190\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n320\n00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:38.680\n>> So it can be kinda of confusing,\nso let's undo that.\n\n321\n00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.180\nSo there we go.\n\n322\n00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:44.530\nNow if you don't hit that check box it\nwill just do what you intended to do,\n\n323\n00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.990\njust to change your practice to header.\n\n324\n00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:51.660\nSo when you use character styles,\ncharacter styles are used for\n\n325\n00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.600\nthings like headings.\n\n326\n00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.720\nOr if you just have small lines of text,\nthat's a character style.\n\n327\n00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.060\nWe need to learn to work\nwith paragraphs as well,\n\n328\n00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.680\ncause sometimes you do have\nparagraphs in Photoshop.\n\n329\n00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:10.232\nSo what we are going to do is, we are\ngoing to Create a paragraph in Photoshop.\n\n330\n00:17:10.232 --> 00:17:13.280\nSo there are two different ways\nto create a textbox in Photoshop.\n\n331\n00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.250\nYou can single click which is my preferred\nmethod or you can draw a textbox.\n\n332\n00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:20.136\nLet's draw a little textbox here.\n\n333\n00:17:20.136 --> 00:17:22.964\nAnd lets change it so it's not 100.\n\n334\n00:17:22.964 --> 00:17:26.370\nLet's do 12 and we'll write,\nthis is a paragraph.\n\n335\n00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.870\nNow, I'm going to copy this.\n\n336\n00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:35.156\nSo I'm going to do Cmd+A or Ctrl+A to\nselect everything in that text box.\n\n337\n00:17:35.156 --> 00:17:41.725\nI'm gonna do Cmd+C and\nI'm just going to paste a few times.\n\n338\n00:17:41.725 --> 00:17:47.431\nI'm actually gonna copy this over\nagain paste it, paste it, paste it.\n\n339\n00:17:47.431 --> 00:17:49.540\nOkay, so\nnow we have a lot of text in here.\n\n340\n00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.930\nBut it doesn't fit in our text box.\n\n341\n00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.860\nYou'll notice that we have\na little plus sign at the box,\n\n342\n00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:00.790\nthat's telling you that you have over\nset text it's not fitting in the box.\n\n343\n00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.460\nLet's say that you went to the move and\nyou're moving this around and\n\n344\n00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:08.730\nyou realize my gosh this sentence\nis cut off, it ends at this.\n\n345\n00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:13.037\nThat's not appropriate, so\nyou try to stretch out the box this way.\n\n346\n00:18:13.037 --> 00:18:16.600\nStretching out the box this\nway stretches your text, okay?\n\n347\n00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.610\nSo we don't wanna do that,undo that.\n\n348\n00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:22.050\nIt's something that happens all\nthe time cause you just think I'm here,\n\n349\n00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.940\nI have this little box that\ntells me I can stretch it.\n\n350\n00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.757\nNo, don't do it that way.\n\n351\n00:18:26.757 --> 00:18:29.170\nLet's go back to our type tool,\nour text tool.\n\n352\n00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.580\nAnd to make sure that our box is selected\nand then you'll have, it'll look the same.\n\n353\n00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.220\nYou have your transform controls.\n\n354\n00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.515\nBut you can drag it out and\nnow our text is there.\n\n355\n00:18:40.515 --> 00:18:46.218\nSo a little tricky thing,\nmake sure that you know what you're doing.\n\n356\n00:18:46.218 --> 00:18:47.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\n\n357\n00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.790\nlet's say that we want to create\na style based on this paragraph text.\n\n358\n00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:57.380\nWe can go to window, paragraph styles,\nand we can create a new paragraph style.\n\n359\n00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.430\nNow you'll notice now it looks crazy.\n\n360\n00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:00.690\nWe don't want that to happen.\n\n361\n00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:03.320\nThe reason why is because for\nsome odd reason in Adobe,\n\n362\n00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.580\ncharacter size override paragraph styles.\n\n363\n00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.335\nSo let's go to our Character style panel.\n\n364\n00:19:08.335 --> 00:19:09.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you'll notice it has header\n\n365\n00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.650\nselected.\n\n366\n00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.810\nNot cool, not what we want,\nlet's click none.\n\n367\n00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:18.040\nAnd now,\nwe just have our paragraph style applied.\n\n368\n00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.970\nNow paragraph styles are really, really\npowerful in all of the Adobe programs.\n\n369\n00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:26.400\nIf we double click, it'll allow\nus to name it, all these things.\n\n370\n00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.160\nThere are advanced\noptions with paragraphs.\n\n371\n00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.520\nSo you can change your vertical scale,\nyour horizontal scale,\n\n372\n00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.970\nyour open type features,\nindents and spacing.\n\n373\n00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:41.650\nIndents and spacing is pretty useful,\nyou can create tab indents.\n\n374\n00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.690\nOr spacing between lines here.\n\n375\n00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:48.820\nYou can also do something with\ncomposition, justification or\n\n376\n00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.350\nhyphenation which is my favorite.\n\n377\n00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:54.820\nSo I personally hate, hate,\nhate, hyphens in design.\n\n378\n00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.160\nI think it looks lazy.\n\n379\n00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.250\nI feel like you should be able to\njustify your text better than that.\n\n380\n00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:03.430\nSo I like to uncheck hyphenation, okay?\n\n381\n00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.390\nSo if you uncheck hyphenation,\n\n382\n00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:10.440\nit's going to shift your text so\nit's no longer hyphenated anywhere.\n\n383\n00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.690\nIt'll move that last word\nto the next line down.\n\n384\n00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:19.060\nOkay, let's see that you wanted to\ncreate a style not based off of another\n\n385\n00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.480\nstyle like we've been doing.\n\n386\n00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.930\nYou can still click New, double click and\n\n387\n00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:27.330\nthen select everything from here as well,\nokay?\n\n388\n00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:28.720\nSo it's all there for you.\n\n389\n00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:30.380\n>> Fantastic.\n\n390\n00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.790\n>> Cancel.\n>> See where this be a big help as you see\n\n391\n00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.690\nthere's a lot of options to deal with but\ntext as well as paragraphs and\n\n392\n00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.430\nyou're working on different projects.\n\n393\n00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:42.700\nYou might have set a font up just\nright for a particular customer and\n\n394\n00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.390\nthen you gonna go back and to work for\nthat customer again months later.\n\n395\n00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:50.490\nYou gonna get to remember all those\nsettings or look at some past work, or\n\n396\n00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:54.140\nyou can have preset right there\nlabelled by customer name and\n\n397\n00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.180\nyou are good to go after\nworking on your next project.\n\n398\n00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.890\n>> Yeah, now there is just one more\nthing I wanna show you in Photoshop, and\n\n399\n00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.190\nthat is how to warp text.\n\n400\n00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:02.860\n>> Warping.\n\n401\n00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.100\n>> Warping yeah this is\ngonna be pretty fun,\n\n402\n00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:09.150\nam actually going to delete this paragraph\ntext so we have a little bit more space.\n\n403\n00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:10.920\nSo I'm just going to make\nsure it's selected, and\n\n404\n00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.930\nI'll just drag it down to the trash can.\n\n405\n00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.660\nOkay, now we have some room.\n\n406\n00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.480\nLet's create a new layer of\ntext by single-clicking and\n\n407\n00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.550\nI'm going to write the word inflate.\n\n408\n00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.790\nGonna make sure it's selected, let's\ndrag it over so you can actually see it.\n\n409\n00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:30.110\nAnd with our type tool selected,\nwe'll have options up here.\n\n410\n00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.660\nOne of them that we didn't touch\non is this T with this little\n\n411\n00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.060\ncurve underneath it.\n\n412\n00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.700\nThis is your create text warp options.\n\n413\n00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.906\nSo if you click on that box,\nyou'll see you have styles here.\n\n414\n00:21:40.906 --> 00:21:42.470\nYou have none, you have ark.\n\n415\n00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.110\nArk-lore, upper,\nall sorts of different things.\n\n416\n00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:49.210\nLet's say that we wanna use inflate\ncuz we wrote the word inflate.\n\n417\n00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:52.380\nWe click on it then you\ncan change the bend.\n\n418\n00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.560\nYou can change the distortion.\n\n419\n00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.557\nYou can change.\n\n420\n00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.672\nAnything that you want about it.\n\n421\n00:21:59.672 --> 00:22:01.560\nSo there we go, now we have inflate.\n\n422\n00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.120\nYou can still do things\nlike change the colors,\n\n423\n00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.890\nchange the font, after you're warped it.\n\n424\n00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:07.901\nSo let's change the color.\n\n425\n00:22:07.901 --> 00:22:11.701\nI'm gonna double click, come over here,\n\n426\n00:22:11.701 --> 00:22:15.932\nchange the color, and\nnow we have warped text.\n\n427\n00:22:15.932 --> 00:22:18.405\nLets try another version of warped text.\n\n428\n00:22:18.405 --> 00:22:22.430\nSo, lets go ahead and\nsingle click and lets do Rise.\n\n429\n00:22:23.855 --> 00:22:27.780\nOkay, with Rise selected,\nI will come up here to text warp and\n\n430\n00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.180\nthen we have an option for Rise.\n\n431\n00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:36.527\nSee, you could do horizontal, you could\ndo vertical, you can change the bend make\n\n432\n00:22:36.527 --> 00:22:42.250\nit rise more,\nall of these options are here for you.\n\n433\n00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:45.350\nSo if you're asked on the exam\nto create warped text or\n\n434\n00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:49.330\nto inflate text or to make it\nrise this is where you would go.\n\n435\n00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.600\nJust make sure you're one the type tool,\nyou're on the correct layer and\n\n436\n00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.060\ngo to your warped text.\n\n437\n00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.200\n>> Very cool Kara, again,\na lot of things you can do\n\n438\n00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:02.732\nwhen it comes to manipulating your text\nand your paragraphs within Photoshop.\n\n439\n00:23:02.732 --> 00:23:05.850\nAll right, I hope everybody\nout there enjoyed this one.\n\n440\n00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:08.680\nSigning off for ITPRO TV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n441\n00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.577\n>> And I'm Kara Paige.\n\n442\n00:23:09.577 --> 00:23:11.679\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n443\n00:23:11.679 --> 00:23:19.700\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:20.780\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing Adobe Photoshop's CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.320\nSpecifically in this episode, we're going\nto be looking at shapes and layer styles.\n\n5\n00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.420\nHere to help us with\nthat is Miss Kara Paige.\n\n6\n00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.680\nHow are you doing Kara?\n\n7\n00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.345\n>> I'm great,\nI'm excited to start working with shapes.\n\n8\n00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:33.740\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n9\n00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.140\n>> All right, are you ready?\n\n10\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.650\n>> I'm ready.\n\n11\n00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.650\n>> Okay, so go ahead and get Photoshop\nup and running, so we're ready to go.\n\n12\n00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.060\nAnd we're going to make a new document, so\n\n13\n00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.510\nI'm either going to click the new\nbutton or I'm going to go to file-new.\n\n14\n00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.310\nI'm just going to select a preset here,\nso if you go to your document type and\n\n15\n00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.190\nchoose photo.\n\n16\n00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.740\nI'm going to choose my size,\nlandscape 8x10's,\n\n17\n00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.290\nthat way we have a nice wide\narea to experiment with.\n\n18\n00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.150\nAll right?\n\n19\n00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.560\nSo click okay.\n\n20\n00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.160\nAnd there we go.\n\n21\n00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.343\nWe have have our nice, just blank canvass\nready for us to practice the shapes.\n\n22\n00:01:06.343 --> 00:01:07.836\n>> Plenty of room to get creative.\n\n23\n00:01:07.836 --> 00:01:09.180\n>> Plenty of room.\n\n24\n00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.110\nSo what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to access our shapes tool.\n\n25\n00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.330\nSo your shapes tool is in the bottom\ncorner of your tool panel.\n\n26\n00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.210\nChances are you have this rectangle tool\non top, if not that's completely fine.\n\n27\n00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.980\nYou can just click on your shape and\nnot fly out of he menu up here.\n\n28\n00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.160\nSo, let's test out this\nrectangle tool first.\n\n29\n00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.170\nJust to see what it does.\n\n30\n00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.240\nAll right so I'm just going to click,\nhold and drag out.\n\n31\n00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.201\nAnd now you'll see that I\nhave a nice solid rectangle.\n\n32\n00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:43.440\nSo if you notice I have this\nproperties box that comes up here and\n\n33\n00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.890\nI have a little box that's just black.\n\n34\n00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.820\nThis is my fill color.\n\n35\n00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.160\nSo if you hover over it,\nit will well you, this is my fill type.\n\n36\n00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.180\nSo your fill is what is within\nyour boundary lines of your shape.\n\n37\n00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.210\nSo ours is black right now.\n\n38\n00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.030\nLet's go ahead and change that to\nsomething a little bit more festive.\n\n39\n00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.940\nSo I'm gonna change it to maybe a fuchsia.\n\n40\n00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.900\nAll right?\n\n41\n00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.680\nOkay, so now we have our Fill layer,\nfilled in.\n\n42\n00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.220\nNow we want to add a stroke.\n\n43\n00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.680\nSo a stroke is a boarder or\nan outline to your shape or your path, or\n\n44\n00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.870\nwhatever it is.\n\n45\n00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.570\nSo you can tell right now we don't\nhave a stroke because it's a white\n\n46\n00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.660\nbox with a red line through it.\n\n47\n00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.900\nSo if I were to add a color, I would click\non My Stroke and I would select a color.\n\n48\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.910\nSo I'm gonna pick this nice bright green.\n\n49\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.190\nNow I have green, I have a size,\nwhich is 15, I don't want it to be 15,\n\n50\n00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.910\nI'm going to take it down to 5,\nenter there to commit that change, and\n\n51\n00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.260\nI'm going to change my stroke style.\n\n52\n00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.439\nRight now it's set on these dots, I'm\ngoing to change mine to the solid line.\n\n53\n00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.950\nOkay, and now we have a nice rectangle, so\n\n54\n00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.010\nif we wanted to move it we could use\nour move tool, put it wherever we want.\n\n55\n00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.380\nIf we look at our layers panel,\nyou'll see that we have a rectangle, okay?\n\n56\n00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.480\nSo easy enough.\n\n57\n00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.640\n>> Very cool.\n\n58\n00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.400\n>> Now what if we want to make a square?\n\n59\n00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.760\nThere isn't a square-shape tool, but\n\n60\n00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.080\na square is basically a rectangle,\nso let's take our rectangle tool.\n\n61\n00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.080\nI'm going to create a new layer for\nmy new shape and\n\n62\n00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.760\nI'm going to click,\nhold down shift as I drag.\n\n63\n00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.750\nSo holding down shift and I'm dragging it\nout and it's making that perfect square.\n\n64\n00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.360\n>> Very nice.\n>> So it's constraining proportions,\n\n65\n00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.880\nwhich it does for other tools as well.\n\n66\n00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.390\nYou remember learning about that?\n\n67\n00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.950\n>> I do.\n\n68\n00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.200\n>> Okay, great.\n\n69\n00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.600\nSo now if I want to change the fill\ncolor and the stroke color I could.\n\n70\n00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.960\nSo fill is your first box.\n\n71\n00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.050\nStroke is your second.\n\n72\n00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.815\nMine likes to default to\nthis silly dotted line.\n\n73\n00:03:41.815 --> 00:03:43.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm going to change mine to this dashed\n\n74\n00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.150\nline and make it a little bit smaller.\n\n75\n00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.822\nNow, it's kind of like a crazy coupon.\n\n76\n00:03:47.822 --> 00:03:50.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm just gonna put it over here.\n\n77\n00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.190\nAll right, so\nnow we've experimented with the rectangle,\n\n78\n00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.330\nwe know how to make a square, so\nlet's move on to a different shape.\n\n79\n00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.070\nSo if I click and\n\n80\n00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.300\nhold down on our little tool panel, you'll\nsee we have the rounded rectangle tool.\n\n81\n00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.900\nWorks just the same way as\nour regular rectangle tool,\n\n82\n00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.570\nbut it doesn't have hard edges.\n\n83\n00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.840\nIt has rounded edges.\n\n84\n00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.270\nSo I'm gonna skip that one,\nit's too similar.\n\n85\n00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.050\nLet's go to the ellipse tool.\n\n86\n00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.780\nSo the ellipse tool is a circle.\n\n87\n00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.540\nYou probably remember it from\nthe elliptical marquee tool.\n\n88\n00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.670\nThe way that you create a perfect\ncircle is let's go ahead and\n\n89\n00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.100\nmake a new layer for my circle.\n\n90\n00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.110\nI'm going to click on Shift and\nhold as I drag.\n\n91\n00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.540\nAnd I'll get a perfect circle, okay?\n\n92\n00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.140\nSo, if I wanted to do a different\nway of drawing my circle, I could.\n\n93\n00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.580\nSo, I'm going to undo what I just did.\n\n94\n00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.280\nAnd I'm going to hold down Alt and\ndrag and\n\n95\n00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.960\nthen you'll have a circle that\ncomes straight from the center.\n\n96\n00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.590\nIf you wanted it to be a perfect circle,\n\n97\n00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.040\nyou can combine the two and hold down\nAlt and Shift as you're dragging.\n\n98\n00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.980\nYou'll have a perfect\ncircle from the center.\n\n99\n00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.990\nSo right now you can't actually\nsee our circle except for\n\n100\n00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.450\nthe outline of it because\nthe fill is white.\n\n101\n00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.615\nSo you can change that\nto a nice bright green.\n\n102\n00:04:58.615 --> 00:05:00.602\nGonna add it up here with\nthe rest of my shapes.\n\n103\n00:05:00.602 --> 00:05:01.583\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Got a nice little\n\n104\n00:05:01.583 --> 00:05:02.730\ncollection going up there.\n\n105\n00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.670\n>> Yeah, we have a nice collection.\n\n106\n00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.300\nLet's move on to our next shape,\nwhich is the polygon tool.\n\n107\n00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.700\nSo let's try and\nsee what the polygon tool does.\n\n108\n00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.190\nI'm going to click hold and drag.\n\n109\n00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.000\nNow I have a polygon.\n\n110\n00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.360\nNow you'll notice up at the top I have\nan option to change the side numbers.\n\n111\n00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.200\nRight now it's on five,\nwhich is our pentagon,\n\n112\n00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.880\nright, so if we wanted to\nchange our sides, we could.\n\n113\n00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.730\nAnd let's draw out a new polygon.\n\n114\n00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.059\nNow we have a nice octagon.\n\n115\n00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:33.099\n>> Very neat.\n\n116\n00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.500\n>> Okay, so if you wanted to do\nshapes like that you certainly could.\n\n117\n00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.140\nAll right, then you have your line tools.\n\n118\n00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.858\nSo that's what you use if you\nwant to create a straight line.\n\n119\n00:05:40.858 --> 00:05:43.130\nThat's pretty self-explanatory.\n\n120\n00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.380\nYou can do lines a whole bunch of\ndifferent ways in Photoshop so\n\n121\n00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.150\nwe're not gonna spend time on that.\n\n122\n00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.950\nBut we will talk about\nthis custom shape tool.\n\n123\n00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.900\nSo if you click on the custom shape tool,\nyou'll notice\n\n124\n00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.510\nthat you have a Shape icon up at the top\nof your screen, in your tool options bar.\n\n125\n00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.120\nIf you click on this dropdown,\n\n126\n00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.060\nit'll show you shapes that\nare preloaded in Photoshop.\n\n127\n00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.710\nThis works just like your brushes\npanel if you want to add shapes to it.\n\n128\n00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.970\nSo, if you click on this gear icon,\n\n129\n00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.940\nyou'll notice that you have all of\nthese different options down here.\n\n130\n00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:19.360\nSo, if we were to click on animals,\nfor instance, we'll have our pen or\n\n131\n00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.320\nokay, again, okay, replaces a pen to add.\n\n132\n00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.340\nSome of the pen to add.\n\n133\n00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.680\nAnd now we have some fun\nlittle animal shapes.\n\n134\n00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.930\nSo if we wanted to add a paw\nprint to our picture, we could.\n\n135\n00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.010\nI'm going to change the color, we've got\na lot of green going on right now so.\n\n136\n00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:40.480\nMake sure when you do that, though\n>> You have the right shape selected.\n\n137\n00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.180\n>> Yep,\nwe still have the last shape selected so\n\n138\n00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.780\nI'm gonna do a new layer,\nchange my fill to blue, and\n\n139\n00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.130\nI'm going to click, hold and drag out\n>> This little paw print.\n\n140\n00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.450\nSo if you want it to be perfect,\nyou going to hold down shift.\n\n141\n00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.830\nAnd now we have a fun paw print.\n\n142\n00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.390\n>> Nice.\n\n143\n00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.090\n>> You can also create your own\ncustom shapes, if you like.\n\n144\n00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.890\nSo if you want to use the pen tool,\nwhich you'll be learning about.\n\n145\n00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.530\nYou can draw some custom shapes,\nsave them and\n\n146\n00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.750\nreally just lots of different options for\nshapes.\n\n147\n00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.290\nSo if you're designing\nsomething like a web page and\n\n148\n00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.720\nyou don't wanna go through the trouble\nof making an icon for an email or\n\n149\n00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.050\nsomething like that,\nPhotoshop has one for you already.\n\n150\n00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.790\n>> Very neat.\n\n151\n00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.100\n>> So, quick, simple,\nlittle trick there, right.\n\n152\n00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.940\nLet's say that we wanted to\nlearn how to align these Layers.\n\n153\n00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.890\nMaybe I wanna align certain layers.\n\n154\n00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.880\nSo I'm going to actually get rid of all\nthese green shapes cuz they're a little\n\n155\n00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.620\nbit distracting.\n\n156\n00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.620\nSo I'm going to click on my first one and\nI'm going to hold down shift and\n\n157\n00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.400\nclick on my last one and\ndrag them to my trash can.\n\n158\n00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.266\nSo, there, now I have rectangles and\nI have my paw print.\n\n159\n00:07:46.266 --> 00:07:50.156\nSo, I'm going to select all three\nof these in the layers panel and\n\n160\n00:07:50.156 --> 00:07:52.791\nnow we are going to work\non aligning layers.\n\n161\n00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:56.796\nSo, you'll notice up at the top,\nif we have our Move tool selected,\n\n162\n00:07:56.796 --> 00:07:58.672\nwe have all these little icons.\n\n163\n00:07:58.672 --> 00:08:01.670\nHere, so I'm going to zoom in for you so\nyou can actually see what they say.\n\n164\n00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:06.520\nWhen I do zoom in,\nthey don't like to tell you what they do.\n\n165\n00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.120\nThere we go!\n\n166\n00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.510\nAlign Top Edges,\nlet's see what happens when we do that.\n\n167\n00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.500\nAlign Top Edges,\nalign all the top edges of your layers.\n\n168\n00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.200\nGonna undo that.\n\n169\n00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.770\nAnd I'll just click through to show\nyou your different options here.\n\n170\n00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.020\nYou'll notice that they're\nall aligning differently.\n\n171\n00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:24.920\nOkay?\n\n172\n00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.790\nSo if you wanted to make sure that your\ndesign lined up perfectly, so maybe you\n\n173\n00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:33.900\ncreated a grid, you could align your\nlayers to ensure that your sides match up.\n\n174\n00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.400\nVery nice.\nA lot easier than just kind\n\n175\n00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.290\nof eyeballing it.\n\n176\n00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.060\n>> Yes, a lot easier.\n\n177\n00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:38.925\n>> Or more accurate.\n\n178\n00:08:38.925 --> 00:08:40.940\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes, definitely more accurate.\n\n179\n00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.170\nSo I'm actually going to\nget rid of my shapes now.\n\n180\n00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:44.170\nOkay, goodbye shapes.\n\n181\n00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:46.440\nI'm just gonna drag them\ndown to the trash can.\n\n182\n00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.300\nWe're back to our blank canvas.\n\n183\n00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:55.560\nAll right, let's say that I wanted to\nadd Type to a shape, we can do that.\n\n184\n00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.500\nSo I'm going to use my custom shape\ntool and I'm going to select,\n\n185\n00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:06.670\nlet's select, I dont know, maybe, not that\ncheckerboard, let's do this speech bubble.\n\n186\n00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.420\nOkay?\n\n187\n00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.570\nIf you just click on your document you'll\nnotice that it'll give you width and\n\n188\n00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:13.350\nheight options.\n\n189\n00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.300\nLet's see that.\n\n190\n00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.550\nSo I didn't click, hold, and drag.\n\n191\n00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:16.890\nI just single clicked.\n\n192\n00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.290\nIt came up and\nsaid hey do you wanna do width and height?\n\n193\n00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.830\nI'm gonna say sure.\n\n194\n00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.530\nNow it creates my little guy for me.\n\n195\n00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.260\nNow, 100 by 100 is very small.\n\n196\n00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.530\nSo, let's undo that.\n\n197\n00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.670\nSingle click again, and\nlet's do something larger.\n\n198\n00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.980\nSo, let's do 500 by 500 and hit Enter.\n\n199\n00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.970\nSo, now we have a bigger shape.\n\n200\n00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.180\nI'm going to stretch that out even more.\n\n201\n00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.190\nI'm going to distort the shape\nbecause it's a cartoon.\n\n202\n00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.080\nNow we have this huge speech bubble ok.\n\n203\n00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:50.080\nLet's say that we wanted\nto add type to this path,\n\n204\n00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.760\nso it shapes our paths, which you're\ngoing to learn about in a little bit.\n\n205\n00:09:53.870 --> 00:10:00.420\nWhat we can do is access our type tool and\nthen if you hover over the edge\n\n206\n00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.450\nof your shape, you'll notice that you have\nthis little swirly line with your cursor.\n\n207\n00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.658\nLet's see what were to happen if\nyou clicked with the swirly line.\n\n208\n00:10:12.903 --> 00:10:15.590\nOkay, now we have a flashing cursor.\n\n209\n00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:16.906\nNow, I'm just gonna write hello.\n\n210\n00:10:20.027 --> 00:10:24.010\nNow, you'll notice it's drawing\nalong the edge of my shape.\n\n211\n00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:31.280\nSo I'm just going to say,\nhello, how are you?\n\n212\n00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.060\nOkay, this is looking kinda crazy right?\n\n213\n00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.550\nIt's all jumbled.\n\n214\n00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.200\nPartly because my font's\na little bit large.\n\n215\n00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.600\nBut, I can also adjust this.\n\n216\n00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.470\nSo if we go to this black arrow tool,\nthis is our path selection tool.\n\n217\n00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:48.270\nIt's going to allow me to move my\npath around so you can drag out,\n\n218\n00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.190\nif you'd like to, or\nyou can also drag around.\n\n219\n00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.990\nYou'll notice that it's\nchanging what we can see here.\n\n220\n00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.390\nOkay.\nSo you can drag in or out So,\n\n221\n00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:06.760\ndragging in brings it inside of your\nshape, dragging out brings it outside.\n\n222\n00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:11.030\nAnd you keep dragging around, and\nthen we have this fun hello, how are you?\n\n223\n00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.660\nUpside down, little guy here.\n\n224\n00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:17.270\nOkay, so that's how you can\nuse both text and shapes, and\n\n225\n00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.790\nsomething called a path,\nwhich you will be learning.\n\n226\n00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.480\nVery cool.\n\n227\n00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.950\n>> So let's delete this guy.\n\n228\n00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.430\nWe don't need him anymore.\n\n229\n00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.190\nAnd, since we're talking about text,\nlet's try something else with text.\n\n230\n00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:36.320\nSo I'm going to bring up my layers panel,\nand I'm going to create a layer of text.\n\n231\n00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.810\nNow, we've only learned about\nthe horizontal type tool,\n\n232\n00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.250\nwhich is just Straight across.\n\n233\n00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.520\nThere's also a vertical type tool options.\n\n234\n00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.680\nLet's try that out.\n\n235\n00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.774\nLet's click and let's type in HELLO.\n\n236\n00:11:51.291 --> 00:11:55.830\nOkay, so now we have this nice\nHello there it is it looks great.\n\n237\n00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.830\nI'm actually gonna drag it out a little\nbit, cuz it looks a little bit thin so\n\n238\n00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.430\nI'm gonna drag it out a little bit.\n\n239\n00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.530\nThere we go I'm actually\ngonna change what it says.\n\n240\n00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.590\nI'm gonna change it to say LOGO,\n\n241\n00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:13.270\ncuz we're gonna practice\na concept called layer styles.\n\n242\n00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:13.830\n>> All right.\n\n243\n00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.760\n>> Okay, so here we go, it says LOGO.\n\n244\n00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.990\nNow to access something called\nlayer styles or special effects, as\n\n245\n00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.600\nI like to call them, you click on this FX\nbutton at the bottom of your Layers panel.\n\n246\n00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.910\nSo let me zoom into it.\n\n247\n00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:26.990\nSo you can see it better.\n\n248\n00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.860\nIt's right here at the bottom\nof your layers panel.\n\n249\n00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.070\nSo I'm gonna zoom out so\nthat way you can see my fly out menu.\n\n250\n00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.500\nIf you click on blending options.\n\n251\n00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.100\nit'll show you all of your different\noptions, I'm gonna click on that.\n\n252\n00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.160\nAnd there you'll see we have a ton\nof options over on the left.\n\n253\n00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.130\nI'm gonna drag my box So,\n\n254\n00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:50.470\nyou can actually see our word here,\nand we'll just test this out.\n\n255\n00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.020\nLet's click on Bevel and Emboss.\n\n256\n00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.700\nIf I were to just click on the checkbox,\n\n257\n00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.440\nyou'll notice that it kind of added\na little bit of sheen to our letters.\n\n258\n00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.960\nSo let me zoom in so you can actually\nsee that a little bit better.\n\n259\n00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.750\nSo you'll see there that we have this\n\n260\n00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:08.540\nkind of shinyness almost three\ndimensional quality to our letters now.\n\n261\n00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.800\nAll I had to do was click on\nthis bubble emboss check box.\n\n262\n00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.540\nNow it doesn't let me modify\nthe bubble emboss from this screen,\n\n263\n00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:20.220\nI actually have to click Click\non the word bevel and emboss.\n\n264\n00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:24.750\nOnce I do, you'll notice that we\nhave a massive menu of options here.\n\n265\n00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.180\nSo, different styles that you can do.\n\n266\n00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.630\nDepth, soften, direction,\nshading, all that good stuff.\n\n267\n00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:31.630\nTons of options.\n\n268\n00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:36.580\nI'm actually just going to ignore these\nfor now and show you a different effect or\n\n269\n00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.370\ndifferent layer style.\n\n270\n00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:38.780\nSo let's try a stroke.\n\n271\n00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:42.260\nSo a stroke we just learned\nabout with the shape.\n\n272\n00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.670\nSo the stroke is an outline\noutside of your letters.\n\n273\n00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:49.450\nRight now, mine is set at 250 which is\nabsolutely ridiculous for this size box.\n\n274\n00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.910\nSo let's drag it down to\nsomething more manageable.\n\n275\n00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:57.430\nI'm gonna change the color from black so\nyou can actually see a difference here.\n\n276\n00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:01.690\nSo I'm going to use,\nlet's use a nice kind of bright yellow.\n\n277\n00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.090\nGive it a highlighter effect around.\n\n278\n00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:03.590\n>> Nice.\n\n279\n00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.000\n>> So you can adjust where your stroke is\nso see right now it's positioned outside?\n\n280\n00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.750\nYou can change it to inside.\n\n281\n00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.520\nYou can change it to center.\n\n282\n00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.550\nIt'll have a slightly different effect for\nwhatever you're trying to do.\n\n283\n00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:21.220\nYou can also adjust your blending modes\nas well which is something that we did go\n\n284\n00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.900\nover in an earlier episode.\n\n285\n00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:27.500\nSo if you click on something\nlike let's try color dodge.\n\n286\n00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.150\nIt'll change what it looks like and\nyou know different things.\n\n287\n00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.410\nChances are for the stroke you're\nprobably gonna want to keep it a normal.\n\n288\n00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:38.250\nSome of the other effects work\nreally well with blending modes.\n\n289\n00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.130\nStrokes really aren't, because\nthey're pretty thin for the most part.\n\n290\n00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.740\nAll right,\nlet's move on to something else.\n\n291\n00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.410\nSo you have inner shadow down here.\n\n292\n00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:49.840\nSo you can add an inner shadow to your\nlayers, you can add an inner glow, you do\n\n293\n00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:55.450\nsomething called satin which adds\na little bit of effect to your letters.\n\n294\n00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.150\nOne thing that's really cool is\nsomething called color overlay.\n\n295\n00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.970\nSo, let's look at that.\n\n296\n00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.410\nLet's say that I wanna\nchange this from black.\n\n297\n00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.430\nRight now, it's set to black\nwhich is not what I want.\n\n298\n00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.810\nLet's say that I wanted to change\nthe letters to the bright blue.\n\n299\n00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:14.640\nWhat I can do is with my opacity at 100%,\nit's changing the letters.\n\n300\n00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.160\nNow I have bevel and emboss on so\nit looks a little bit silly.\n\n301\n00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.208\nSo if I were to uncheck bevel and emboss.\n\n302\n00:15:20.208 --> 00:15:23.400\nMay be un-check some\nof my other guys here.\n\n303\n00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.690\nYou'll notice that my\nletters have turned blue.\n\n304\n00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.820\nSo this is our very cool effect\nto their action sounds to.\n\n305\n00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:33.870\nThis is a very cool effect to do,\nif you want to change,\n\n306\n00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.900\nmaybe the color of an object\non your Photoshop screen.\n\n307\n00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:41.020\nSo if you have a flower that you've\nselected with one of your selection tools.\n\n308\n00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.500\nAnd you wanna change the rows from\nyellow to read, you could do that.\n\n309\n00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.640\nYou could also try out to see\nwhat a blending mode would do.\n\n310\n00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.514\nIt works really well with images with\ntext that's just a solid color without\n\n311\n00:15:52.514 --> 00:15:53.188\nvariation.\n\n312\n00:15:53.188 --> 00:15:56.148\nYou're not gonna be able to\ntell much difference there.\n\n313\n00:15:56.148 --> 00:15:58.252\nThen you have something\ncalled a gradient overlay.\n\n314\n00:15:58.252 --> 00:16:04.090\nSo, gradients, what they do is they\nare colors fading into each other.\n\n315\n00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.870\nSo you have all of your different\noptions here to select from, so\n\n316\n00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:11.770\nif you wanted to make your logo look\nreally crazy, you certainly could.\n\n317\n00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:15.190\nLet's say that you had a client\nthat really likes gradients but\n\n318\n00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.190\nyou need to customize the gradient for\nthe client.\n\n319\n00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:23.730\nYou can double-click on\nthe gradient color box,\n\n320\n00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.400\nand then you'll be able\nto adjust your gradient.\n\n321\n00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.470\nSo if you needed to change your colors,\nyou'll notice if you hover over these\n\n322\n00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.610\nlittle tiny square boxes,\nthey say color stop.\n\n323\n00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.929\nSo you can change out\nthe color to something else.\n\n324\n00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.520\nSo now we have orange fading to green.\n\n325\n00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.230\nYou could also adjust where\nthey're fading into each other.\n\n326\n00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.530\nYou'll notice on the left\nmy font is changing so\n\n327\n00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:51.290\nyou're able to see the actual\nchanges that are being made.\n\n328\n00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.240\n>> Very cool.\n\n329\n00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.842\n>> And if I liked this gradient I\ncould save it right from here and\n\n330\n00:16:54.842 --> 00:16:56.450\nuse it in the future.\n\n331\n00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:57.570\nI'm just gonna click OK.\n\n332\n00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:01.060\nYou also have pattern overlay,\nwhich adds texture.\n\n333\n00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.380\nSo, if we wanted to make it look\nlike it had a stony background or\n\n334\n00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.346\nmaybe it looks sparkly, this way we could.\n\n335\n00:17:06.346 --> 00:17:10.170\nThen you have your outer glow and\ndrop shadows.\n\n336\n00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.580\nDrop shadow is something that you use\nquite a bit in Photoshop especially if\n\n337\n00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:17.910\nyou're adding items into a picture\nthat maybe is not natural in some way.\n\n338\n00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:23.040\nSo let's say that you had an item that\nyou wanted to add to a kitchen table and\n\n339\n00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.630\nyou want to make it look\nlike it was there along.\n\n340\n00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:30.830\nYou could take a drop shadow and just add\na very slight shadow to your object so,\n\n341\n00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.355\nthat way it matches the rest\nof the shadows on the table.\n\n342\n00:17:33.355 --> 00:17:35.350\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n343\n00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.934\n>> So, drop shadows have a lot of options\nhere, you can change the opacity, so\n\n344\n00:17:38.934 --> 00:17:42.440\nwhether it's really obvious,\nwhether it's not so obvious.\n\n345\n00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.010\nYou can change the angle, so\n\n346\n00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:49.310\nas I drag this angle, you can notice\nthat the percentage is changing here.\n\n347\n00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:52.540\nI'm going to adjust my distance so\nyou can actually see my drop shadow.\n\n348\n00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:58.760\nYou can change the spread,\nyou can change the size.\n\n349\n00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.402\nAnd if you just keep changing the angle,\n\n350\n00:18:00.402 --> 00:18:02.250\nyou can get it exactly\nwhere you want it to go.\n\n351\n00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.700\nIt's also a way to create\na 3D effect with your text.\n\n352\n00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.320\n>> It really does.\n\n353\n00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.410\nAs soon as you made that shadow come out,\n\n354\n00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:11.610\nit almost looked like\nthe text jumped off the page.\n\n355\n00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:12.250\n>> It did, it did.\n\n356\n00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:17.230\nSo here we go, just a few different\nlooks out of drop shadows.\n\n357\n00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.880\nSo, we didn't want the drop shadow\nto be as in your face as is now.\n\n358\n00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.610\nIf you want it to be subtle,\nwe could lower the opacity some.\n\n359\n00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:26.520\nYou can also lower the spread,\n\n360\n00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:31.320\nlower the distance, make it look\na little bit more reasonable there.\n\n361\n00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.620\nSo that's a brief intro to layer styles.\n\n362\n00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.470\nSo let's pull everything we\njust did into one thing and\n\n363\n00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:42.580\ntalk about something called a layer comp.\n\n364\n00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.080\nSo I'm gonna get rid of this\nlogo text cuz we don't need it.\n\n365\n00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.780\nAnd I'm going to create\nan example logo for a client.\n\n366\n00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:54.470\nSo, let's get out our shape tool and\nlet's do an ellipse.\n\n367\n00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.490\nI'm gonna make it black and\n\n368\n00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:02.770\nI'm just going to click then\nhold on shift and drag out.\n\n369\n00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.770\nNow we have this nice black box.\n\n370\n00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.620\nSo, what should our company be named?\n\n371\n00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.740\nWhat do you think?\n\n372\n00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.130\n>> Bob's Biscuits.\n\n373\n00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.990\n>> All right, Bob's Biscuits it is.\n\n374\n00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:18.988\nSo let's pick out a font for Bob.\n\n375\n00:19:18.988 --> 00:19:21.220\nI'm just gonna go to my text tool and\n\n376\n00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.340\nI'm just gonna pick,\nlet's do two very different fonts.\n\n377\n00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:28.615\nI'm gonna just do a simple Arial,\nso let's do an Arial bold.\n\n378\n00:19:28.615 --> 00:19:33.035\nI'm gonna click inside my circle,\nand see how large my cursor is?\n\n379\n00:19:33.035 --> 00:19:36.190\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> My font is a little bit large for\n\n380\n00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.810\nthis circle.\n\n381\n00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.360\n>> I don't think Bob's Biscuits\nis going to fit.\n\n382\n00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.450\n>> No,\nI don't think it's gonna fit either.\n\n383\n00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.489\nSo let's try something smaller, maybe 20.\n\n384\n00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.570\nOkay, let's do Bob's Biscuits.\n\n385\n00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:48.110\nBut I can't see it,\ndo you know why I can't see it?\n\n386\n00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.870\n>> Maybe our text is black?\n\n387\n00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.280\n>> Our text is black.\n\n388\n00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.220\nSo you can do Cmd+a to\nselect all of your text and\n\n389\n00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.150\nI'm going to change the text to white.\n\n390\n00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.060\nOkay, so now we have Bob's Biscuits,\nthat can be bigger.\n\n391\n00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.580\n20 is a little small, so\nlet's make it bigger.\n\n392\n00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:10.360\nLet's try 36, and there we go,\nlet's just enter that down a little bit.\n\n393\n00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.280\nOkay, so now we have Bob's Biscuits.\n\n394\n00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.980\nHere he is.\n\n395\n00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.620\nI'm just going to drag my\ntext up a little bit so\n\n396\n00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.880\nthat way it's in the center of my circle.\n\n397\n00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.950\nLet's add some special effects\nto this Bob's Biscuits.\n\n398\n00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:27.960\nThis is really boring, Bob needs something\na little bit more exciting in his life.\n\n399\n00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.810\nHe does, he needs a little flair so\nhe can really sell these biscuits.\n\n400\n00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:31.830\n>> He does, he does.\n\n401\n00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.230\nSo let's first play around with\nthis circle, cuz it's boring.\n\n402\n00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:37.590\nSo let's click on our ellipse.\n\n403\n00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.060\nMake sure that your ellipse\ntool is selected, and\n\n404\n00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.840\nthen let's give it a stroke up at the top.\n\n405\n00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.500\nSo what color do you think\nthis stroke should be?\n\n406\n00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.340\n>> If we're sticking with black\nI kind of like that yellow\n\n407\n00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.630\nthat you were using with the black\nearlier, that was a nice contrast.\n\n408\n00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:51.690\n>> All right, let's do yellow.\n\n409\n00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.310\nSo let's click on yellow, and\n\n410\n00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.650\nlet's not do those dots cuz I\njust really don't like them.\n\n411\n00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.020\nSo let's change it to this dash line and\nmake it smaller.\n\n412\n00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.922\nDash lines kind of have\nthis homey feel to them.\n\n413\n00:21:03.922 --> 00:21:07.490\nSo there we go, Bob's Biscuits, nice.\n\n414\n00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:11.430\nNow we need to add some effects to the\ntext so let's go to our layers panel and\n\n415\n00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:13.380\nclick on FX for our layer styles.\n\n416\n00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.150\nAnd let's do a stroke for Bob's Biscuits.\n\n417\n00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.480\nThat yellow is a little bit much.\n\n418\n00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.260\nSo I'm going to drag it down a little bit.\n\n419\n00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.380\nAnd then, let's just go crazy with this.\n\n420\n00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:31.259\nAnd let's add some kind of gradient\noverlay to Bob's Biscuits.\n\n421\n00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.990\nSo I'm just gonna use one\nthat's already in here,\n\n422\n00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:39.290\nI'm gonna make it really bold,\nthere we go.\n\n423\n00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:40.350\nNow we have Bob's Biscuit.\n\n424\n00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:46.830\nSo here we have our first logo option for\nBob, so it's simple, easy.\n\n425\n00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.370\nLet's go ahead and make this into a group.\n\n426\n00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:51.120\nSo we learned about\ngroups a long time ago,\n\n427\n00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.510\nthe way that we make a group,\nis by either clicking on the folder and\n\n428\n00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:58.828\ndragging the layers in, or by selecting\nour layers and dragging them to a folder.\n\n429\n00:21:58.828 --> 00:22:03.910\nSo I'm gonna do that, I'm going to\nclick Shift and drag into a folder.\n\n430\n00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:05.820\nNow we have group one.\n\n431\n00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.220\nSo I'm just gonna name it logo1.\n\n432\n00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:13.760\nI'm going to expand this so\nI can still see it.\n\n433\n00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.010\nLet's actually make a copy of this logo,\nso maybe he likes this look but\n\n434\n00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:18.990\nhe doesn't like the colors.\n\n435\n00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:23.990\nSo let's see what we can do,\nso let's go ahead and\n\n436\n00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.280\nI'm just gonna copy this ellipse.\n\n437\n00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.230\nSo I'm going to,\nover here with my move tool,\n\n438\n00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:32.675\nI'm gonna do my favorite form of copying,\nwhich is doing Alt+drag.\n\n439\n00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.250\nAnd now we have a different ellipse.\n\n440\n00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:38.840\nBut it's in our logo1 folder.\n\n441\n00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.900\nWe don't want that,\nthat's not what we want.\n\n442\n00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:45.142\nSo let's drag it above our logo1,\n\n443\n00:22:45.142 --> 00:22:50.090\nand now it's not inside that logo1 folder.\n\n444\n00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.230\nLet's change our stroke color,\nso to do that,\n\n445\n00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:54.070\nwe need to make sure we're\non our ellipse tool.\n\n446\n00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:59.100\nLet's change this one,\nlet's choose maybe a nice, subtle blue.\n\n447\n00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.870\nSo now we have a nice blue.\n\n448\n00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:04.380\nLet's try a different font for\n\n449\n00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:09.570\nBob's Biscuits, because it needs to look\ndifferent more than just the colors.\n\n450\n00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:14.240\nSo I am going to click inside of my\ncircle and let's pick a different font.\n\n451\n00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.469\nSo I'm just gonna pick,\nlet's do one that's more of a script font,\n\n452\n00:23:19.469 --> 00:23:23.629\nso a cursive font, and\nlet's see what happens there.\n\n453\n00:23:28.521 --> 00:23:29.877\n>> Nice.\n\n454\n00:23:29.877 --> 00:23:33.282\n>> Okay, so now we have\nBob's Biscuits hanging out there.\n\n455\n00:23:33.282 --> 00:23:37.020\nI'm gonna move it down so\nthat way it looks pretty good on my shape.\n\n456\n00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:41.880\nI can also make this font a little bit\nlarger, so let's change this to maybe 45,\n\n457\n00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.940\nthere we go that's better.\n\n458\n00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.036\nCenter Bob, there he is.\n\n459\n00:23:47.036 --> 00:23:49.919\nOkay, so\nwe've got Bob's Biscuits we're good, but\n\n460\n00:23:49.919 --> 00:23:53.187\nmaybe Bob likes the text effects\nthat we did on the other logo.\n\n461\n00:23:53.187 --> 00:23:55.824\nWe can actually copy those layer effects.\n\n462\n00:23:55.824 --> 00:23:57.100\nSo let's see how we do that.\n\n463\n00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:03.443\nLet's expand this folder so we can\nactually see our Bob's Biscuit's effects.\n\n464\n00:24:03.443 --> 00:24:08.140\nIf we right-click on Effects,\nyou can copy layer style.\n\n465\n00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:15.350\nThen if we click on Bob's Biscuits, we can\nright click and paste our layer style.\n\n466\n00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.850\n>> Wow.\n\n467\n00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.170\n>> Okay, so that saved us\na whole bunch of steps there.\n\n468\n00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:19.910\n>> Absolutely.\n\n469\n00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:21.390\n>> Quick and easy.\n\n470\n00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:25.180\nBut let's say that on this one he\ndoesn't like the stroke around Bob's.\n\n471\n00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.880\nYou can actually click on the little\neyeball icon next to stroke and\n\n472\n00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.300\nturn off that stroke.\n\n473\n00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.800\nSo if you're trying to figure out\nhow to get rid of a layer style or\n\n474\n00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.900\nyou're trying to modify it.\n\n475\n00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.930\nYou can click on the eyeballs or\nyou can right click and\n\n476\n00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:40.830\nyou can do Remove Layer Style, copy it.\n\n477\n00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.200\nYou can do all sorts of things there.\n\n478\n00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.710\nYou can also always add\nadditional layer styles to it.\n\n479\n00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:49.790\nIt'll just add to your effects.\n\n480\n00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:53.140\nNow if you have a lot of effects maybe\nyou have ten effects on something and\n\n481\n00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:56.800\nyou don't like that and you need to\ncollapse it just click on up arrow here.\n\n482\n00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:02.732\nAll right, so let's make one more\nlayer folder and we're gonna name it\n\n483\n00:25:02.732 --> 00:25:08.090\nLogo2 and now we're going to talk\nabout something called a layer comp.\n\n484\n00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:13.960\nSo a layer comp is where you do, let's\nsay two example of something like a logo.\n\n485\n00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.860\nYou want to show the client both, but\n\n486\n00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.070\nyou don't want to overwhelm them\nby showing them all at once.\n\n487\n00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:21.500\nThis might be a good way for\nyou to save time,\n\n488\n00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:26.330\nand for the client to save a headache,\nby doing something called a layer comp.\n\n489\n00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.370\nSo, let's access that layer comp menu.\n\n490\n00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:31.660\nWhat we're going to do is,\nwe're gonna go up to Window, and\n\n491\n00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:37.050\nwe're going to select Layer Comps, okay.\n\n492\n00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:41.450\nAnd I'm going to take out\nthe visibility of logo 2, so that way,\n\n493\n00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.133\nwe only see logo 1 here.\n\n494\n00:25:43.133 --> 00:25:44.147\nOkay.\n\n495\n00:25:44.147 --> 00:25:47.518\nAnd I'm going to click on this new icon,\n\n496\n00:25:47.518 --> 00:25:51.791\njust like a new layer and\nI'm gonna name it Logo1.\n\n497\n00:25:51.791 --> 00:25:55.553\nOkay, now I'm gonna hide\nthe visibility on Logo1,\n\n498\n00:25:55.553 --> 00:26:00.584\nturn on the visibility of Logo2,\ncreate a new layer, name it Logo2.\n\n499\n00:26:01.745 --> 00:26:06.345\nAnd now you can click\nbetween our two states and\n\n500\n00:26:06.345 --> 00:26:08.215\nsee our totally different logos.\n\n501\n00:26:08.215 --> 00:26:10.335\n>> Very cool.\n\n502\n00:26:10.335 --> 00:26:12.995\n>> Okay, so those are layer comps.\n\n503\n00:26:12.995 --> 00:26:14.815\nNow I'm pretty much sums up this lesson.\n\n504\n00:26:14.815 --> 00:26:15.955\n>> Fantastic Cara.\n\n505\n00:26:15.955 --> 00:26:16.965\nGreat look there.\n\n506\n00:26:16.965 --> 00:26:20.125\nWe started off creating shapes,\nlots of different shapes.\n\n507\n00:26:20.125 --> 00:26:22.626\nThen we took a like at\nthose effects those,\n\n508\n00:26:22.626 --> 00:26:26.806\nlayer styles that we could apply and\nto round things off with layer cos.\n\n509\n00:26:26.806 --> 00:26:29.392\nGreat stuff,\ngreat demonstrations we appreciate that.\n\n510\n00:26:29.392 --> 00:26:32.959\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching,\nsigning off for ITPro.TV,\n\n511\n00:26:32.959 --> 00:26:33.945\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n512\n00:26:33.945 --> 00:26:34.699\n>> And I'm Cara Paige.\n\n513\n00:26:34.699 --> 00:26:36.742\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n514\n00:26:36.742 --> 00:26:44.940\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.105\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.105 --> 00:00:21.006\nAnd today we're doing\nAdobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:23.974\nAnd specifically,\nin this episode, it's time for\n\n6\n00:00:23.974 --> 00:00:26.410\nanother one of those exciting try it outs.\n\n7\n00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.150\nAnd in this one, we're gonna be\ndoing layer styles and shapes.\n\n8\n00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.141\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is Miss Kara Page.\n\n9\n00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:33.040\nHow are you doing Kara?\n\n10\n00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.677\n>> I'm great.\n\n11\n00:00:33.677 --> 00:00:36.170\nAre you ready to start\napplying what we just learned?\n\n12\n00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.370\n>> I'm ready.\n\n13\n00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.950\n>> All right.\n\n14\n00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.184\nSo today, we're actually going to be\ncreating a logo for you, a designer.\n\n15\n00:00:43.184 --> 00:00:44.903\nSo, get excited.\n\n16\n00:00:44.903 --> 00:00:46.054\n>> I am excited.\n\n17\n00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:46.702\n>> I'm glad.\n\n18\n00:00:46.702 --> 00:00:49.311\nWe're gonna use a whole bunch of\nthe tools that we've learned so\n\n19\n00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:51.470\nfar to create a logo for yourself.\n\n20\n00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.850\nSo go ahead and open Photoshop and\nwe're going to create a new document.\n\n21\n00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.950\nOkay, this one's gonna be custom.\n\n22\n00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.423\nSo, I'm gonna change it from inches,\nto pixels, and\n\n23\n00:01:03.423 --> 00:01:10.444\nI'm gonna do a 600 by 600 pixel document,\nso, that way, it's a nice square.\n\n24\n00:01:10.444 --> 00:01:12.430\nI prefer to design in\nsquares when I do logos.\n\n25\n00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.185\nI don't know why.\nThat's just my personal preference.\n\n26\n00:01:14.185 --> 00:01:15.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, we're gonna do a square.\n\n27\n00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.180\nI'm gonna change my color mode to CMYK,\nresolution's Fine, but\n\n28\n00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.490\nwe don't want a background.\n\n29\n00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.450\nWe want it to be transparent, that way we\ncan use our logo a whole bunch of places\n\n30\n00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.796\nwithout having a white\nbackground attached.\n\n31\n00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:30.510\nSo, let's do Transparent and OK.\n\n32\n00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.560\nSo now, we have our nice background.\n\n33\n00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.380\nIt's blank.\n\n34\n00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.880\nThat's great.\n\n35\n00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.655\nNow, to make sure that we're\ndoing everything centered,\n\n36\n00:01:40.655 --> 00:01:42.701\nwe're going to create guides.\n\n37\n00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:45.707\nSo, guides aren't something\nthat you've done yet, so\n\n38\n00:01:45.707 --> 00:01:47.532\nwe're gonna learn how to do them.\n\n39\n00:01:47.532 --> 00:01:50.820\nThe first thing that we wanna do is\nmake sure you have your rulers enabled.\n\n40\n00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.680\nIf not, go up to your View menu and\nclick on Rulers, okay.\n\n41\n00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.580\nOnce you have your rulers created,\n\n42\n00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.660\nmy favorite way to create a guide is to\nclick on the ruler, hold and drag out.\n\n43\n00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.630\nNow, the nice thing about being a 600\nby 600 pixel document is that it has\n\n44\n00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.465\na nice even middle.\n\n45\n00:02:10.465 --> 00:02:12.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it ends up being one inch.\n\n46\n00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.130\nNow you'll notice that we're in pixels but\nmy ruler's in inches.\n\n47\n00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.990\nI can always change my preferences of\nmy ruler by right-clicking on it and\n\n48\n00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.860\nchanging it to Pixels.\n\n49\n00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.680\nOkay?\n\n50\n00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.380\nSo, if we change it to Pixels,\nthere we go.\n\n51\n00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.040\nNow, let's drag a guide\nfrom the other side.\n\n52\n00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.674\nSo, I'm gonna drag a guide from here,\nand, this time, I'm going to 300.\n\n53\n00:02:31.674 --> 00:02:35.210\nAll right, so once you're there,\nthere you go, so now you have guides.\n\n54\n00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.990\nSo these are telling you exactly\nwhere the center of your document is.\n\n55\n00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.710\nSo the first thing we're gonna do\nis we're going to create a shape.\n\n56\n00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.190\nSo we're going to create a circle.\n\n57\n00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:53.320\nSo, we're gonna grab our circle and I'm\ngoing to click on these crosshairs, okay.\n\n58\n00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.040\nI have From Center selected, so that's\ngonna say it's gonna go from the center of\n\n59\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.820\nmy document, and I'm going to make it\na width of 600 by 6, actually, no.\n\n60\n00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.710\nLet's not do 600,\ncuz that's the size of our document.\n\n61\n00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.202\nLet's do 500 by 500, click OK.\n\n62\n00:03:08.202 --> 00:03:10.950\nAnd now we have a nice circle.\n\n63\n00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.880\nSo I'm actually going to\nkeep my circle black,\n\n64\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.970\ncuz that's going to be\nmy bottom-most circle.\n\n65\n00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.220\nBut I wanna make another\ncircle on top of it.\n\n66\n00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.600\nSo let's click on the crosshairs again.\n\n67\n00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.340\nAnd this time,\nI'm going to do 480 by 480, click OK.\n\n68\n00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.170\nNow you can't see the circle,\nbecause it's the same color.\n\n69\n00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.820\nBut you can see the outline of the circle.\n\n70\n00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.270\nSo let's give this guy a stroke.\n\n71\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.490\nSo I'm gonna click on\nmy little Stroke box.\n\n72\n00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.640\nRight now we don't have a stroke so\nI'm gonna click on this.\n\n73\n00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.691\nAnd let's do this nice bright blue color,\nokay?\n\n74\n00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:51.519\nAnd again, I have those circles up.\n\n75\n00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.950\nI'm gonna change it to a solid line.\n\n76\n00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.460\nAnd let's make it, 2 points.\n\n77\n00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.224\nNow, I'm gonna change\nthe interior of my shape as well,\n\n78\n00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:05.650\ncuz I wanna have this nice kind of dark\ngrey, black/blue color scheme going on.\n\n79\n00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.290\nSo I'm gonna change my shape\ncolor to a nice dark gray.\n\n80\n00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.760\nSo I just chose the 90% gray.\n\n81\n00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.296\nYou can pick whatever gray you like.\n\n82\n00:04:18.296 --> 00:04:26.220\nAll right, so, now I want to convert\nthis shape into a path, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.100\nSo I'm going to click up here where\nit says Shape and click Path.\n\n84\n00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.410\nAnd I'm going to single-click\non my crosshairs again,\n\n85\n00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.800\nnow you'll notice that\nmy icon has changed.\n\n86\n00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.562\nAll right?\n\n87\n00:04:39.562 --> 00:04:44.568\nFrom the single-click,\nand I'm going to do,\n\n88\n00:04:44.568 --> 00:04:49.333\nlet's do maybe 470 by 470, click OK.\n\n89\n00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:54.554\nNow, you'll notice that we have\nthis little line here, all right?\n\n90\n00:04:54.554 --> 00:04:57.596\nI wanna add text to this line.\n\n91\n00:04:57.596 --> 00:05:02.996\nSo, I'm going to select my Type tool and\nif I hover over my path,\n\n92\n00:05:02.996 --> 00:05:06.696\nyou'll see that I have that swirly cursor.\n\n93\n00:05:06.696 --> 00:05:11.323\nSo, I'm gonna single-click and\nI am going to write a,\n\n94\n00:05:11.323 --> 00:05:15.073\nEstablished, E-S-T, 2016, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:15.073 --> 00:05:17.520\nOr you can put your year of birth if\nyou want, that's completely fine.\n\n96\n00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.300\nOr what year you started designing,\nit's totally up to you.\n\n97\n00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:26.710\nI'm gonna change this to Arial, and\nI'm going to change it to Arial Bold.\n\n98\n00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.884\nRight now it's at 45 which is\na little bit large for this.\n\n99\n00:05:29.884 --> 00:05:34.413\nSo, let's take it down to maybe, 10.\n\n100\n00:05:34.413 --> 00:05:38.209\nOkay, so,\nI need to flip my established around.\n\n101\n00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:42.992\nSo, I need to make sure that my\nDirect Selection tool is selected.\n\n102\n00:05:42.992 --> 00:05:46.870\nAnd you'll notice that now I have\nthis little cursor with these arrows.\n\n103\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:53.940\nIf I were to click, hold and flip, I could\nadd my established to the bottom there.\n\n104\n00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.485\n>> Very cool.\n\n105\n00:05:54.485 --> 00:05:56.140\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n106\n00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:01.830\nAll right, let's add another circle\nto our little logo here that we have.\n\n107\n00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.670\nSo I'm going to go back to my circle,\nor my Ellipse tool, and\n\n108\n00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.605\nI need to change it back to a shape.\n\n109\n00:06:07.605 --> 00:06:10.863\nCuz right now it's on a path, so\nit's not going to show me anything.\n\n110\n00:06:10.863 --> 00:06:12.941\nSo I need to go to Shape.\n\n111\n00:06:12.941 --> 00:06:19.978\nI'm gonna single-click, and\nlet's do this one 400 by 400.\n\n112\n00:06:19.978 --> 00:06:23.290\nOkay, so\nnow we have this nice solid color.\n\n113\n00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.640\nNow, I want this to be the exact\nsame color as my stroke, so\n\n114\n00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.340\nI'm gonna click on my Fill, and\n\n115\n00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.650\nit'll be right up here in your recently\nused colors, since you've just used it.\n\n116\n00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.660\nSo I'm wanna single-click on that, and\n\n117\n00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.770\nI do wanna ad a stroke\nto this interior circle.\n\n118\n00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.370\nJust to spice it up,\nadd a little bit of flair.\n\n119\n00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.672\nSo I'm gonna change my stroke to white,\nand\n\n120\n00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:51.620\nactually I'm going to use the dot\nthis time but not crazily.\n\n121\n00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.059\nSo, I'm going to change my dots.\n\n122\n00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:54.569\nLet's try 5, see what that looks like.\n\n123\n00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:56.697\nThat's not bad.\n\n124\n00:06:56.697 --> 00:07:00.063\nI'm gonna actually take it down to may 3,\nso it's a little bit more subtle.\n\n125\n00:07:00.063 --> 00:07:01.723\nThere we go, that's more classy.\n\n126\n00:07:01.723 --> 00:07:02.617\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n127\n00:07:02.617 --> 00:07:06.285\nAll right, so we have a logo,\nit says established 2016, but\n\n128\n00:07:06.285 --> 00:07:08.300\nwe don't have what the logo is for.\n\n129\n00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.630\nSo we need to add some text.\n\n130\n00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:16.020\nSo I'm going to select my type tool and\nI'm actually going to just single-click\n\n131\n00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.740\noutside and drag in cuz I'm gonna show\nyou, you can do it that way as well.\n\n132\n00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.460\nNow I'm gonna type in designs.\n\n133\n00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.930\nI'll highlight it, lets make it,\nlets make it this dark gray color.\n\n134\n00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.990\nNow we can see it,\nI'm gonna drag it up here.\n\n135\n00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.752\nAnd you'll know when you're right in\nthe center because your guide lines will\n\n136\n00:07:36.752 --> 00:07:39.730\nhighlight, so you'll see now it's purple.\n\n137\n00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.500\nSo this is the very\nvery center of my logo.\n\n138\n00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.553\nNow, I don't want it to be in the exact\ncenter cuz we're gonna add a line of text\n\n139\n00:07:45.553 --> 00:07:46.074\nbeneath it.\n\n140\n00:07:46.074 --> 00:07:49.908\nSo, I'm gonna drag it up some,\nbut it's still along my guide so\n\n141\n00:07:49.908 --> 00:07:51.554\nI know it's in the center.\n\n142\n00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:54.350\nI'm gonna double-click on my t to\nhighlight and let's change this.\n\n143\n00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.820\nYou can pick any kind of\nscript font that you want.\n\n144\n00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.634\nI wanna make it a lot bigger.\n\n145\n00:08:00.634 --> 00:08:03.072\nMaybe not that big, let's try 32.\n\n146\n00:08:03.072 --> 00:08:05.457\nNope, nope, 28.\n\n147\n00:08:05.457 --> 00:08:07.336\nThat's gonna be the winner.\n\n148\n00:08:07.336 --> 00:08:09.900\nAll right, and\nI'm gonna drag it down just a little bit.\n\n149\n00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.720\nOkay, so\nnow we have Designs which looks nice.\n\n150\n00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.200\nBut we can add some layer styles to it.\n\n151\n00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.170\nSo if you click on your FX at the bottom.\n\n152\n00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.930\nI'm going to add a slight stroke to mine.\n\n153\n00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.000\nSo if you click on your Stroke,\n\n154\n00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.870\nright now mine is yellow cuz that's\nthe last stroke that we made.\n\n155\n00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.260\nI'm going to change it to white.\n\n156\n00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.110\nAnd I'm actually gonna leave it at\n3 cuz I like the way that looks.\n\n157\n00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.830\nI'm just gonna click OK.\n\n158\n00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:39.930\nSo now we have designs.\n\n159\n00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:42.120\nIt's nice, simple, just has a stroke.\n\n160\n00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.366\nIt just stands out a little\nbit more with that stroke.\n\n161\n00:08:44.366 --> 00:08:45.446\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n162\n00:08:45.446 --> 00:08:47.600\n>> All right, and\nlet's just add one more line of text.\n\n163\n00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.290\nSo I'm gonna click on my T.\n\n164\n00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.220\nNow I'm just gonna single-click down here,\nand I'm gonna put by me.\n\n165\n00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.230\nYou can put whatever your name is.\n\n166\n00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.540\nThat's completely fine.\n\n167\n00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.580\nI'm just gonna go back to an Arial,\nlet's do just Arial Bold.\n\n168\n00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:09.610\nI'm gonna change it to 16 pixels,\ndrag it over and\n\n169\n00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:13.140\nyou can use these guides cuz they'll tell\nyou, okay good, you're lined up properly.\n\n170\n00:09:14.778 --> 00:09:17.380\nThere you go, so\nif you wanted to add the same layer style,\n\n171\n00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.740\nif you want it to look the same.\n\n172\n00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:23.821\nRemember, you can right-click\non your layer style,\n\n173\n00:09:23.821 --> 00:09:29.134\ncopy your layer style, and\nthen paste your layer style.\n\n174\n00:09:29.134 --> 00:09:32.397\nAll right, so now, if you wanted to do\na different version of the logo, so\n\n175\n00:09:32.397 --> 00:09:35.240\nif you wanted to change out the colors and\nsee what you want to do,\n\n176\n00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.081\nyou could do layer comps if you wanted, so\n\n177\n00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:40.326\nthat way you could compare your\ndifferent layers, compare your logos.\n\n178\n00:09:40.326 --> 00:09:43.572\nNow, if we were to save this logo\ncuz we wanna use it in the future,\n\n179\n00:09:43.572 --> 00:09:46.470\nwe need to save it as\nthe right file type now.\n\n180\n00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.260\nOkay, so, we need to save it as a file\ntype that is going to preserve this\n\n181\n00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.070\ntransparent background.\n\n182\n00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.810\nSo, I would recommend\nsaving this as a PNG.\n\n183\n00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.570\nAll right, and there you have it.\n\n184\n00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.150\nThat's how to make a logo in Photoshop.\n\n185\n00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.110\nFantastic.\n\n186\n00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.800\nTry it out exercise, lots of fun.\n\n187\n00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.660\nWe got a brand new logo\nin less than ten minutes.\n\n188\n00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.650\nThank you for that Kara,\nwe appreciate that.\n\n189\n00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.590\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n190\n00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.264\nSigning off for ITproTV.\n\n191\n00:10:11.264 --> 00:10:12.124\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n192\n00:10:12.124 --> 00:10:12.984\n>> And I'm Kara Page.\n\n193\n00:10:12.984 --> 00:10:14.935\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n194\n00:10:14.935 --> 00:10:22.467\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.544 --> 00:00:20.667\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we're doing Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:25.573\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna be looking at pins, puppets and\n\n6\n00:00:25.573 --> 00:00:26.328\nchannels.\n\n7\n00:00:26.328 --> 00:00:29.969\nNow they might not seem like they go\ntogether, and maybe they don't, but\n\n8\n00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:33.684\nthey're some of the more advanced\nthings that we can do within Photoshop.\n\n9\n00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:36.216\nAnd here to help us with all\nof this is Mr. Nick Page.\n\n10\n00:00:36.216 --> 00:00:37.183\nHow are you doing Nick?\n\n11\n00:00:37.183 --> 00:00:38.305\n>> I'm doing pretty well.\n\n12\n00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:40.092\nTime to take a look at this.\n\n13\n00:00:40.092 --> 00:00:42.258\nWhen you think of pens,\npuppets and channels,\n\n14\n00:00:42.258 --> 00:00:44.108\nthey really really don't go together.\n\n15\n00:00:44.108 --> 00:00:47.345\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So here, let's start with the pen tool.\n\n16\n00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:52.004\nIt's a more advanced selection app tool,\nso it works in the realm of\n\n17\n00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:56.993\nvectors instead of raster,\nwhich most other photo editing pieces are,\n\n18\n00:00:56.993 --> 00:01:00.861\ndeal with pixels,\nlittle tiny squares on your screen.\n\n19\n00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:04.467\nVectors are more, you have a path and\nit's filled with something.\n\n20\n00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:07.794\nSo, it's more scalable.\n\n21\n00:01:07.794 --> 00:01:11.256\nSo I started down in the Photoshop and\n\n22\n00:01:11.256 --> 00:01:16.281\nget you started off by,\nlet's open up a new file, and\n\n23\n00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:21.774\nthen select default Photoshop size,\nand I'll click OK.\n\n24\n00:01:21.774 --> 00:01:26.247\nSo our pen tool is located on\nthe left side on the tools panel,\n\n25\n00:01:26.247 --> 00:01:30.217\nand then right down here,\nright below the blur tool.\n\n26\n00:01:30.217 --> 00:01:34.074\nAnd it can be activated\nwith the P shortcut.\n\n27\n00:01:34.074 --> 00:01:38.442\nSo let's first start off by making a path.\n\n28\n00:01:38.442 --> 00:01:43.233\nWhen you think of a pen you'd normally\nthink just clicking and dragging.\n\n29\n00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:49.929\nBut in the pen tool, it has that option,\nbut the main use of it is line segments.\n\n30\n00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.118\nSo we'll start off by creating an anchor\npoint for where the line will begin, and\n\n31\n00:01:54.118 --> 00:01:57.703\nthen click where the line will end,\nso I'll click to the right of it.\n\n32\n00:01:57.703 --> 00:02:01.356\n>> So you actually let go, you didn't\nhold the mouse button down that time\n\n33\n00:02:01.356 --> 00:02:02.332\n>> Right, so let go.\n\n34\n00:02:02.332 --> 00:02:02.968\n>> Okay.\n\n35\n00:02:02.968 --> 00:02:07.403\n>> So we created a line segment right\nhere, just a portion of a line,\n\n36\n00:02:07.403 --> 00:02:09.835\nand it's very boring, straight.\n\n37\n00:02:09.835 --> 00:02:13.623\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let's undo, I'll hit Ctrl+Z, or\n\n38\n00:02:13.623 --> 00:02:18.631\nCmd+Z on a Mac, and then step\nback one more time by Ctrl+Alt+Z.\n\n39\n00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:22.919\nAnd then now, let's do the same thing,\nbut a perfectly straight version of it.\n\n40\n00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.892\nSo click once, let go.\n\n41\n00:02:25.892 --> 00:02:29.199\nThen I'll hold Shift, and\nthen click at the ending point.\n\n42\n00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:30.329\nThis is a straight line.\n\n43\n00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.352\nJust holding shift constrains the-\n>> So even if you were off,\n\n44\n00:02:34.352 --> 00:02:37.529\nif you were trying to draw that horizontal\nline, that Shift constrained it.\n\n45\n00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:38.460\n>> Exactly.\n>> Okay.\n\n46\n00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.325\n>> So let's take another step in this, and\n\n47\n00:02:41.325 --> 00:02:46.315\nI'll just back out once, undo once,\nand now I'm gonna make a curve.\n\n48\n00:02:46.315 --> 00:02:48.164\nSo when you make a curve,\n\n49\n00:02:48.164 --> 00:02:53.020\nessentially you're creating\nsomething called a Bezier curve.\n\n50\n00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.150\nSo let me click my ending point, what I'm\ngonna do, I'm gonna click, hold, and drag.\n\n51\n00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.694\nSo here we'll go.\n\n52\n00:02:59.694 --> 00:03:04.100\nClick, then now I drag around, and\nyou see it's adding a curve to that line.\n\n53\n00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.740\n>> Very cool.\n\n54\n00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.430\n>> Very cool indeed.\n\n55\n00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.978\nBeing a Bezier curve,\nit's very mathematical and\n\n56\n00:03:10.978 --> 00:03:13.654\nall the calculations are going\non in the background.\n\n57\n00:03:13.654 --> 00:03:18.663\nVery complicated thing, but with these\nhandles, we can modify the curve.\n\n58\n00:03:18.663 --> 00:03:22.557\nSo here I let go of the curve so\nnow it's what you see.\n\n59\n00:03:22.557 --> 00:03:25.691\nAnd I can modify the anchor\npoints on to the left and\n\n60\n00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:28.234\nright of the main points that I clicked.\n\n61\n00:03:28.234 --> 00:03:33.319\nSo I can do that by holding Shift on\nmy pen tool, or on my keyboard, and\n\n62\n00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.705\nthen I can just drag a handle and\nyou see it's moving the existing curve.\n\n63\n00:03:38.705 --> 00:03:41.348\nSo if I was drawing a shape and\nI was a little off,\n\n64\n00:03:41.348 --> 00:03:45.332\nI could use these handles to tweak it and\ncorrect it to how I want it to be.\n\n65\n00:03:45.332 --> 00:03:45.981\n>> Nice.\n\n66\n00:03:45.981 --> 00:03:50.104\nAnd with this tool, you seem to get a nice\nperfect curve, whereas if I try to do it\n\n67\n00:03:50.104 --> 00:03:53.505\nfreehand with a brush or\nsomething like that, maybe not so good.\n\n68\n00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:54.670\n>> Exactly.\n\n69\n00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.010\nSo right now, I'm gonna show you\nhow to create a better selection or\n\n70\n00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.130\na more accurate selection\nwith the pen tool.\n\n71\n00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.742\nSo let's take a look at this, and what\nwe're gonna do for this is we're gonna\n\n72\n00:04:04.742 --> 00:04:07.985\ntype a letter, and then select\nthe letter and create a path out of it.\n\n73\n00:04:07.985 --> 00:04:13.160\nSo first thing's first, we need to work\non finishing up our existing path.\n\n74\n00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.739\nWell, to complete a path,\nI'll create a few more pieces and\n\n75\n00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.899\nthen, once you hover\nover the starting point,\n\n76\n00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:29.042\nyou will see a circle on your pen tool.\n\n77\n00:04:29.042 --> 00:04:31.491\nWhen you do this, if you click on it,\nit will finish the path.\n\n78\n00:04:31.491 --> 00:04:34.842\nVery similar to polygonal lasso tool and\ncreating those paths.\n\n79\n00:04:34.842 --> 00:04:36.651\nThe selections, sorry.\n\n80\n00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:44.924\nSo now we have completed path here which\nwe could view in the paths window.\n\n81\n00:04:44.924 --> 00:04:49.565\nSo if we want to delete this path\nbecause we're done with it right now,\n\n82\n00:04:49.565 --> 00:04:54.439\nwe could go to, in the path window,\nclick on select path right there, and\n\n83\n00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:58.315\nthen go to the trash can on\nthe bottom right, right there.\n\n84\n00:04:58.315 --> 00:05:01.870\n>> Or, you can just select it,\neither in the paths window, and\n\n85\n00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.690\nthen hit delete, on the keyboard.\n\n86\n00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.196\nGone.\n\n87\n00:05:05.196 --> 00:05:05.830\n>> Easy.\n\n88\n00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.711\n>> So, now we are back to a blank slate.\n\n89\n00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:12.315\n>> So, what we're gonna do now is go\nover creating a better, more accurate\n\n90\n00:05:12.315 --> 00:05:17.383\nselection, and it's one of the more,\none of the applications on the pen tool.\n\n91\n00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:24.460\nSo we'll start with creating,\ntyping an O with the text tool.\n\n92\n00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.638\nAnd then let's make it a little\nbit bigger so it's easier to see.\n\n93\n00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.592\nThere we go.\n\n94\n00:05:34.592 --> 00:05:38.470\nNow, let's change the color so\nyou'll be able to see the pen tool path.\n\n95\n00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.022\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'll do that and go up to here and\n\n96\n00:05:43.022 --> 00:05:45.502\nthen change a nice yellow.\n\n97\n00:05:45.502 --> 00:05:46.672\nHopefully it's not hard on your eyes.\n\n98\n00:05:46.672 --> 00:05:49.256\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n99\n00:05:49.256 --> 00:05:51.898\nSo, let's go back to our pen tool.\n\n100\n00:05:51.898 --> 00:05:53.209\nThere we go.\n\n101\n00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:55.273\nAnd then, I'm gonna zoom in a little bit.\n\n102\n00:05:57.871 --> 00:05:59.326\nThat's too much.\n\n103\n00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:01.853\nSo, selecting with the pen tool, you wanna\n\n104\n00:06:01.853 --> 00:06:06.104\ntry to create the smoothest paths with\nthe least amount of anchor points.\n\n105\n00:06:06.104 --> 00:06:09.848\nJust so you don't have jagged\npaths going like this.\n\n106\n00:06:09.848 --> 00:06:12.240\nIt just will not create a smooth path.\n\n107\n00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.950\n>> It will not be a very nice O.\n\n108\n00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.052\n>> Exactly.\n\n109\n00:06:15.052 --> 00:06:16.973\nI wanna back out of that.\n\n110\n00:06:16.973 --> 00:06:24.983\nSo, let's start off by clicking on the\nleft side of this O and, just click, done.\n\n111\n00:06:24.983 --> 00:06:29.719\nNow I'm gonna go to the top, and then,\nso we can get this little curve here,\n\n112\n00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:33.876\nthis top curve, and I will click and\nhold and then start dragging.\n\n113\n00:06:33.876 --> 00:06:38.740\nDragging all around you can see only\none direction really kinda looks good,\n\n114\n00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.854\nso I will be dragging clockwise,\nyou'll see I'm going right.\n\n115\n00:06:42.854 --> 00:06:48.161\nSo now, I'm gonna hold Shift to kind\nof straighten out these anchor points,\n\n116\n00:06:48.161 --> 00:06:51.770\nor these handles,\nuntil it looks just about right.\n\n117\n00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:52.481\nThat looks good to me.\n\n118\n00:06:52.481 --> 00:06:53.585\n>> Very nice.\n\n119\n00:06:53.585 --> 00:06:58.433\n>> So, next one down, I'm gonna click\non the right side of this circle.\n\n120\n00:06:58.433 --> 00:07:00.035\nAnd then I'll hold.\n\n121\n00:07:00.035 --> 00:07:06.989\nThen go down a little bit just to\nkind of make it very accurate.\n\n122\n00:07:06.989 --> 00:07:11.386\nAnd, same thing with the bottom\nat the six o'clock area.\n\n123\n00:07:11.386 --> 00:07:16.442\nAnd then, when creating these,\nyou always want to create your path,\n\n124\n00:07:16.442 --> 00:07:22.112\nor you mostly always wanna create your\npath and drag it towards your next path.\n\n125\n00:07:22.112 --> 00:07:24.161\nSo the same direction.\n\n126\n00:07:24.161 --> 00:07:29.053\nSo that's why you see me going\nclockwise with my selections.\n\n127\n00:07:29.053 --> 00:07:31.965\nSo now that's about right, there.\n\n128\n00:07:31.965 --> 00:07:35.918\nAnd then to finish it off I can either\nclick here to finish the path, but\n\n129\n00:07:35.918 --> 00:07:39.080\nyou see it kind of chopped off\na piece of my circle there.\n\n130\n00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.522\nSo, let's-\n>> Can we fix that?\n\n131\n00:07:42.522 --> 00:07:43.404\n>> Yeah, let's fix that.\n\n132\n00:07:43.404 --> 00:07:45.038\nSo, I'm gonna undue this one.\n\n133\n00:07:45.038 --> 00:07:51.481\nWhen you're completing a path,\nI did not right here you'll see,\n\n134\n00:07:51.481 --> 00:07:55.402\nif I drag right at the end, I can edit it.\n\n135\n00:07:55.402 --> 00:07:57.131\nLet's go back one more time.\n\n136\n00:07:57.131 --> 00:08:00.933\nHow I did it before,\njust clicking it, finish the path and\n\n137\n00:08:00.933 --> 00:08:05.744\nit didn't have my right curves going\non with the handles, so if I click and\n\n138\n00:08:05.744 --> 00:08:10.966\nhold, I can adjust the handles and then\nonce I release it, the path is compete.\n\n139\n00:08:10.966 --> 00:08:16.790\nSo let's go to the bottom\nright area of this circle.\n\n140\n00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.550\nSee it's a little bit off.\n\n141\n00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:24.777\nYou see some white space between\nthe path and the yellow part.\n\n142\n00:08:24.777 --> 00:08:27.225\nSo let's edit this.\n\n143\n00:08:27.225 --> 00:08:31.833\nWith this we're going to\nuse the convert point tool.\n\n144\n00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:34.255\nIt's under the pen tool on the left side.\n\n145\n00:08:34.255 --> 00:08:35.303\nYou click and hold.\n\n146\n00:08:35.303 --> 00:08:38.517\nYou got the pen tool, free form pen tool,\nadd anchor point tool,\n\n147\n00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:41.037\ndelete anchor point tool,\nand the convert point.\n\n148\n00:08:41.037 --> 00:08:42.975\nSo I click convert point.\n\n149\n00:08:42.975 --> 00:08:46.625\nAnd then now, I see this point right here.\n\n150\n00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:50.913\nNow this is your mouse, so\nyou see the big picture.\n\n151\n00:08:50.913 --> 00:08:52.296\nThere.\n\n152\n00:08:52.296 --> 00:08:54.066\nSo I'll click this.\n\n153\n00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:56.650\nAnd I just lost my handles.\n\n154\n00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.000\nSo, if I clicked an held.\n\n155\n00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.148\nSo now I'm kind of resetting\neach side of this.\n\n156\n00:09:04.148 --> 00:09:05.941\nSo I can edit it this way.\n\n157\n00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:11.811\nBut you see I still have one side of it as\na not as perfect yet as I want it to be.\n\n158\n00:09:11.811 --> 00:09:12.501\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n159\n00:09:12.501 --> 00:09:17.435\n>> So what I wanna do here is\nselect the part of the path\n\n160\n00:09:17.435 --> 00:09:21.913\nbetween this point here and\nthis point here.\n\n161\n00:09:21.913 --> 00:09:27.945\nSo what I'll do, there's this arrow down\nhere, right below where the pen tool is.\n\n162\n00:09:27.945 --> 00:09:31.139\nIt's called the path selection tool.\n\n163\n00:09:31.139 --> 00:09:34.160\nBelow, or in that tool,\nlike a subtool for it,\n\n164\n00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.270\nis the direct path,\nthe direct selection tool.\n\n165\n00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:41.573\nThis is what I can use to\nselect segments of the path.\n\n166\n00:09:41.573 --> 00:09:44.550\nSo, in this case,\nI'll just click and drag.\n\n167\n00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.872\nIn the area where I want to edit.\n\n168\n00:09:45.872 --> 00:09:49.661\nAnd you can see the handles that\nare pertaining to the thing\n\n169\n00:09:49.661 --> 00:09:52.451\nthat I selected are being shown right now.\n\n170\n00:09:52.451 --> 00:09:57.867\nNot the other sides, so with this, I can\nactually edit these handles individually.\n\n171\n00:09:57.867 --> 00:09:58.698\n>> I see.\n\n172\n00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:03.278\n>> So it's good for\nminor tweaking of your path.\n\n173\n00:10:03.278 --> 00:10:07.383\nSo, with this selection tool,\nselect that, and\n\n174\n00:10:07.383 --> 00:10:11.292\nthen I'll go back to my\nconvert point tool, and\n\n175\n00:10:11.292 --> 00:10:17.082\nthen I can tweak these just a little\nbit on each side to make it perfect.\n\n176\n00:10:17.082 --> 00:10:18.288\nThere we go.\n\n177\n00:10:18.288 --> 00:10:22.222\nSo now it's pretty much\na perfect selection.\n\n178\n00:10:22.222 --> 00:10:26.588\n>> A lot more accurate than you're gonna\nget trying to use one of your other tools\n\n179\n00:10:26.588 --> 00:10:28.941\nwhere you're creating line segments and\n\n180\n00:10:28.941 --> 00:10:33.056\nyou end up with a hexagon looking\nselection or multi faceted selection.\n\n181\n00:10:33.056 --> 00:10:34.567\n>> Definitely.\n>> Nice smooth curve.\n\n182\n00:10:34.567 --> 00:10:40.122\n>> Mm-hm, so that's really good for the\npen tool and what you can do with this,\n\n183\n00:10:40.122 --> 00:10:44.827\nif you create logos you'll learn\nabout this in Illustrator, but\n\n184\n00:10:44.827 --> 00:10:48.418\nPhotoshop you can create\nlogos with vectors, and\n\n185\n00:10:48.418 --> 00:10:53.581\nthen also you could take these paths and\nconvert them to custom shapes.\n\n186\n00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:57.758\nWith the custom shapes you can use\nthe custom shape tool to make that shape\n\n187\n00:10:57.758 --> 00:11:01.336\nas big as you want it to be, and\nit will not be distorted at all.\n\n188\n00:11:01.336 --> 00:11:06.390\nYou won't have any quality loss,\ncuz it's all vector based.\n\n189\n00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.280\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n190\n00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.729\nLike you said, it was vector, not pixels.\n\n191\n00:11:08.729 --> 00:11:09.266\n>> Right.\n\n192\n00:11:09.266 --> 00:11:09.857\n>> Or raster.\n\n193\n00:11:09.857 --> 00:11:15.405\n>> Mm-hm, exactly, so back to our O.\n\n194\n00:11:15.405 --> 00:11:17.416\nNow you see I have\nthe outer part of it done.\n\n195\n00:11:17.416 --> 00:11:19.729\nLet's create the inner part, so\n\n196\n00:11:19.729 --> 00:11:24.684\nI'll go to my path window in the bottom\nright, and then I'll uncheck or\n\n197\n00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:29.239\nunselect this path, just click in\nthe empty space of the window.\n\n198\n00:11:29.239 --> 00:11:33.200\nAnd then I'll pull out the pen tool again,\nthere we go, and\n\n199\n00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.698\nthen let's do the same thing but\njust on the inside.\n\n200\n00:11:36.698 --> 00:11:38.927\nSo I'll zoom in a little bit.\n\n201\n00:11:38.927 --> 00:11:44.065\nAnd now with this, I'll show you\nmy way of doing the drawing paths,\n\n202\n00:11:44.065 --> 00:11:49.114\nso I'll start off with the place\nwe started before, I'll click,\n\n203\n00:11:49.114 --> 00:11:54.642\nand then I'm gonna add a little bit of\ncurve to it without even seeing it.\n\n204\n00:11:54.642 --> 00:11:57.410\nI'm just kind of\npre-curving it if you will.\n\n205\n00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.184\n>> Mm-hm [LAUGH] doing\na little guesstimate.\n\n206\n00:11:59.184 --> 00:12:00.069\n>> Right.\n\n207\n00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:03.314\nAnd I'm holding Shift while doing\nthis to show it's perfectly,\n\n208\n00:12:03.314 --> 00:12:05.027\nit's going straight up and down.\n\n209\n00:12:05.027 --> 00:12:06.235\nAnd I'll let go.\n\n210\n00:12:06.235 --> 00:12:07.695\nNow I'll do the next one.\n\n211\n00:12:07.695 --> 00:12:08.770\nUp at the top.\n\n212\n00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.324\nClick.\n\n213\n00:12:09.324 --> 00:12:12.259\nAnd then I'll hold Shift,\nand then I'll drag it over.\n\n214\n00:12:14.256 --> 00:12:14.817\nThere we go.\n\n215\n00:12:14.817 --> 00:12:17.403\nLet's do the third one, on the right side.\n\n216\n00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:22.674\nClick, hold Shift,\ndrag down towards my next point.\n\n217\n00:12:22.674 --> 00:12:28.702\nThen on the bottom, I'll click, hold,\nand then hold Shift, and then drag left.\n\n218\n00:12:28.702 --> 00:12:30.246\nThere we go.\n\n219\n00:12:30.246 --> 00:12:35.452\nAnd then next one, finally,\nI'll close it off, I'll click.\n\n220\n00:12:35.452 --> 00:12:39.578\nAnd now because I already did the handles\non that first one, the beginning,\n\n221\n00:12:39.578 --> 00:12:41.846\nI don't really have to do them at the end.\n\n222\n00:12:41.846 --> 00:12:46.497\nSo that's what that beginning\nkind of pre-curving was for.\n\n223\n00:12:46.497 --> 00:12:50.002\n>> And this is where the experience\nyou have if you use the pen tool for\n\n224\n00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:51.826\nseveral years and\n>> you get a feel for\n\n225\n00:12:51.826 --> 00:12:54.037\nwhere it's gonna go or\nwhat you need to do.\n\n226\n00:12:54.037 --> 00:12:55.508\n>> Exactly.\n\n227\n00:12:55.508 --> 00:13:01.085\nSo now I have this,\nI think I lost my first path.\n\n228\n00:13:01.085 --> 00:13:05.813\nAll right, I appear to have lost my\nfirst path, so this always happens,\n\n229\n00:13:05.813 --> 00:13:09.467\nso this is a good time to show\nmore about the path window.\n\n230\n00:13:09.467 --> 00:13:11.739\n>> Okay.\nLet's drag this up here just so\n\n231\n00:13:11.739 --> 00:13:13.164\nyou can see it better.\n\n232\n00:13:13.164 --> 00:13:16.875\nPaths, I'm gonna click,\nthis is how you would create a new layer,\n\n233\n00:13:16.875 --> 00:13:18.250\nI'll create a new path.\n\n234\n00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.805\nSo I'll click it here.\n\n235\n00:13:19.805 --> 00:13:22.169\nSo now our path one is right there.\n\n236\n00:13:22.169 --> 00:13:27.907\nI wanna select the existing\npath that I have.\n\n237\n00:13:27.907 --> 00:13:30.103\nI'll cut that with Ctrl+X.\n\n238\n00:13:30.103 --> 00:13:34.076\nAnd then go into path one and paste it to\nshow that it's the path one that I have.\n\n239\n00:13:34.076 --> 00:13:39.305\nI wanna name this one inner O.\n\n240\n00:13:39.305 --> 00:13:44.191\nSo now I wanna recreate the outer O,\nbut I'll do this much quicker,\n\n241\n00:13:44.191 --> 00:13:50.396\nexactly how I did it before, I'll create\na new path here, I'll rename this outer O.\n\n242\n00:13:50.396 --> 00:13:54.977\nAnd then let's create that quick quickly,\nso outer O,\n\n243\n00:13:54.977 --> 00:13:57.714\nhere we go, here go, here we go.\n\n244\n00:13:59.946 --> 00:14:05.056\nAnd then also holding the space bar while\nyou're working it's a way to pan around,\n\n245\n00:14:05.056 --> 00:14:07.620\nvery, very useful when using a pen tool.\n\n246\n00:14:10.981 --> 00:14:14.356\nYeah I can see we're going to spend a lot\nof time zoomed in really close to be\n\n247\n00:14:14.356 --> 00:14:15.960\nworking with that kind of tool.\n\n248\n00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.619\n>> Yes.\n>> So being\n\n249\n00:14:16.619 --> 00:14:20.345\nable to switch quickly to pan around, to\nmove a little bit over on your image and\n\n250\n00:14:20.345 --> 00:14:24.087\ncontinue to select without actually\nswitching tools has gotta be very handy.\n\n251\n00:14:24.087 --> 00:14:25.455\n>> Very handy.\n\n252\n00:14:25.455 --> 00:14:30.767\nSo I created the inner O, created\nthe outer O, now, I'll go to my layers and\n\n253\n00:14:30.767 --> 00:14:34.592\nI will make this O,\nthe actual text layer O invisible.\n\n254\n00:14:34.592 --> 00:14:37.767\nSo you could see exactly what the path is.\n\n255\n00:14:37.767 --> 00:14:41.223\nSo I'll go back to the paths now and\nthen select both of them.\n\n256\n00:14:41.223 --> 00:14:43.327\nHold Ctrl and select the other one.\n\n257\n00:14:43.327 --> 00:14:47.400\nSo now this is the path that\nI created using, I just.\n\n258\n00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.136\n>> Looks like a perfect match.\n\n259\n00:14:48.136 --> 00:14:49.279\n>> Exactly.\n\n260\n00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:55.910\nSo I recommend using text or\nfonts and there's different letters.\n\n261\n00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.318\nVery good practice.\n\n262\n00:14:57.318 --> 00:15:00.397\nVery, cuz you have a ton of them there.\n\n263\n00:15:00.397 --> 00:15:01.592\nSo you might as well.\n\n264\n00:15:01.592 --> 00:15:02.785\nIt's free practice tools.\n\n265\n00:15:02.785 --> 00:15:06.301\n>> [LAUGHTER]\n>> Very, very cool\n\n266\n00:15:06.301 --> 00:15:07.301\n>> Yeah.\n\n267\n00:15:07.301 --> 00:15:12.471\nThen, now let's go for.\n\n268\n00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:17.942\nSay we wanted to take this and\ncreate a selection out of it.\n\n269\n00:15:17.942 --> 00:15:20.539\nI'll just take the outer O right here.\n\n270\n00:15:20.539 --> 00:15:24.890\nIf you wanna create a selection out\nof your path, say if you cut out\n\n271\n00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:29.797\nsomething very very complex, and\nyou wanna create a selection out of it,\n\n272\n00:15:29.797 --> 00:15:34.017\nsay if you wanna do a border around it or\ndo some kind of masking.\n\n273\n00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:38.329\nYou could go to your path\nselection tool right here,\n\n274\n00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:43.138\nselect your path,\nright-click on it, make selection.\n\n275\n00:15:43.138 --> 00:15:48.301\nThen you could change the feathering,\nanti-aliasing in case, because\n\n276\n00:15:48.301 --> 00:15:54.213\nthe vectors are absolute, when you switch\nto pixels it becomes a little more fuzzy,\n\n277\n00:15:54.213 --> 00:15:59.208\nif you expand bigger, but with this\nwe're just gonna keep it at zero and\n\n278\n00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:05.400\nyou'll see it's a pretty good selection,\nhard, there it is, see the marching ants?\n\n279\n00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.768\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n280\n00:16:06.768 --> 00:16:11.164\nSo, if I wanted to go further I\ncould just put this on a layer and\n\n281\n00:16:11.164 --> 00:16:13.882\nfill it, actually, let's do that.\n\n282\n00:16:13.882 --> 00:16:16.127\nCreate a new layer here.\n\n283\n00:16:16.127 --> 00:16:21.176\nAnd I will fill this with my paint\nbucket tool right there, black.\n\n284\n00:16:21.176 --> 00:16:22.708\n>> Very cool.\n\n285\n00:16:22.708 --> 00:16:24.580\nSo you've got a lot of uses for\nthat pen tool.\n\n286\n00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.912\n>> Yes.\n\n287\n00:16:26.912 --> 00:16:33.729\nAll right, so\nnow let's make this a little bit smaller.\n\n288\n00:16:33.729 --> 00:16:37.673\nWe're gonna do a little segue right here.\n\n289\n00:16:37.673 --> 00:16:38.925\nWell, I'll just do a little more pen tool.\n\n290\n00:16:38.925 --> 00:16:41.357\nCuz I kinda like pen tool art here.\n\n291\n00:16:41.357 --> 00:16:44.680\nWhile we're doing this, I'll show you,\nwhat I mentioned earlier,\n\n292\n00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.324\nthe pen tool is not, like,\nreally drawn with a pen, but\n\n293\n00:16:47.324 --> 00:16:50.791\nthere is the free form pen tool,\nwhich is like really drawing with a pen.\n\n294\n00:16:50.791 --> 00:16:55.003\nSo, just draw around,\ncreate my own little path like this.\n\n295\n00:16:55.003 --> 00:16:58.507\nAnd it just created all those\nanchor points from what I just did.\n\n296\n00:16:58.507 --> 00:17:01.928\nSo, it's smart, but\nit's really hard to use,\n\n297\n00:17:01.928 --> 00:17:07.366\nif you're just trying to be really,\nreally accurate with your selections.\n\n298\n00:17:07.366 --> 00:17:13.142\nAll right, so\nnow let's do a quick thing here.\n\n299\n00:17:13.142 --> 00:17:16.434\nI'll keep this circle here, for now, and\n\n300\n00:17:16.434 --> 00:17:22.301\nI'm gonna draw a simple path below the\ncircle so lets go back to the pen tool.\n\n301\n00:17:22.301 --> 00:17:28.313\nI'll take this, click there, and I'll\nclick down here and drag to the right,\n\n302\n00:17:28.313 --> 00:17:33.999\nhold Shift while I do it to keep it level,\nand then the next one I will click.\n\n303\n00:17:33.999 --> 00:17:35.437\nHeld shift.\n\n304\n00:17:35.437 --> 00:17:36.605\nThere.\n\n305\n00:17:36.605 --> 00:17:38.215\nThen just click.\n\n306\n00:17:38.215 --> 00:17:40.126\nSo now I have this little smooth path.\n\n307\n00:17:40.126 --> 00:17:42.744\nIt's kind of like a,\nI think of a smiley face with one eye.\n\n308\n00:17:42.744 --> 00:17:45.078\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And what I'm gonna do here.\n\n309\n00:17:45.078 --> 00:17:47.398\n>> Cyclops' can be happy too\n>> Exactly.\n\n310\n00:17:47.398 --> 00:17:51.325\nSo I'm gonna take the text tool,\nand the paths are really cool,\n\n311\n00:17:51.325 --> 00:17:55.557\nbecause you can take the text tool and\nthen just write along the path.\n\n312\n00:17:55.557 --> 00:18:02.523\nSo I change my text down a little bit,\nand then I just say, smile.\n\n313\n00:18:02.523 --> 00:18:03.497\n>> Very cool.\n\n314\n00:18:03.497 --> 00:18:07.614\n>> And then I can adjust,\nusing my direct selection tool,\n\n315\n00:18:07.614 --> 00:18:11.919\nI can adjust the position of\nthis there we go, of the text.\n\n316\n00:18:11.919 --> 00:18:18.223\nAnd now, it's kind of hard to see,\nso let me just change that up.\n\n317\n00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:20.279\nThere.\n\n318\n00:18:20.279 --> 00:18:24.419\nSo you can type along the path, that's\na very useful trick of the pen tool.\n\n319\n00:18:24.419 --> 00:18:27.588\n>> So the arc doesn't actually stay there,\nit just acts as a guide to the text.\n\n320\n00:18:27.588 --> 00:18:28.212\n>> Exactly.\n\n321\n00:18:28.212 --> 00:18:29.582\nVery cool, right?\n\n322\n00:18:29.582 --> 00:18:32.527\nSo, that's about it for right now,\n\n323\n00:18:32.527 --> 00:18:38.423\nwe're gonna continue on our next episode,\nto further our drawing here.\n\n324\n00:18:38.423 --> 00:18:40.573\n>> [LAUGH] All right, very good,\nNick we appreciate that,\n\n325\n00:18:40.573 --> 00:18:42.188\ngreat demonstration with that pen tool.\n\n326\n00:18:42.188 --> 00:18:44.060\n>> As Nick said it's a complex tool,\n\n327\n00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.913\nit takes a little bit of\npractice getting used to it.\n\n328\n00:18:46.913 --> 00:18:49.921\nSo do like Nick did,\nbreak out just some of your fonts and\n\n329\n00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:54.021\nstart tracing, get used to the feel of\ndragging those Bezier handles out and\n\n330\n00:18:54.021 --> 00:18:57.055\ngetting those curves to match\nyour letters just right.\n\n331\n00:18:57.055 --> 00:19:00.195\nAll right we appreciate that hope\neverybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n332\n00:19:00.195 --> 00:19:02.723\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n333\n00:19:02.723 --> 00:19:03.440\n>> And I'm Nick Page.\n\n334\n00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.491\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n335\n00:19:05.491 --> 00:19:13.819\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:20.000\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing Adobe Photoshop CC2015.\n\n4\n00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.589\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna be looking at the pen, puppet and\n\n5\n00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.660\nchannels, and\nthis is actually is gonna be a part two.\n\n6\n00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.670\nWe've already started and we've worked our\nway through some of the options that we\n\n7\n00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.650\ncan do with the Pen tool, and\nwe're just gonna continue on.\n\n8\n00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.240\nSo if you missed part one, make sure\nyou go back and watch that first,\n\n9\n00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.200\notherwise let's just dive right back\nin with none other than Mr. Nick Page.\n\n10\n00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.910\nHow you doing Nick?\n\n11\n00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.070\n>> Pretty good,\nready to continue this lesson.\n\n12\n00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.250\nSo right here, I'm gonna start\nexactly where we left off at.\n\n13\n00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.670\nSo you see we have our big circle on\nthe top, and then a smile below it.\n\n14\n00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.960\nSo I'm gonna do, I'm gonna kind of\nmove smile out of the way for now.\n\n15\n00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.530\nWe're not really interested\nin smiling just yet.\n\n16\n00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.446\nYou'll smile at the final product,\ndon't worry.\n\n17\n00:01:01.446 --> 00:01:05.357\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'll need to make that invisible.\n\n18\n00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:09.405\nSo what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna start drawing something for you.\n\n19\n00:01:10.665 --> 00:01:14.904\nAnd also show another use of the pen or\npaths in general.\n\n20\n00:01:14.904 --> 00:01:15.689\n>> Okay.\n\n21\n00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.590\n>> So what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna go to the Pen tool.\n\n22\n00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.709\nAnd I will zoom out just a little bit.\n\n23\n00:01:22.473 --> 00:01:26.964\nAnd then I wanna start by drawing\na path starting at the top here and\n\n24\n00:01:26.964 --> 00:01:29.180\nthen hold Space to scroll down.\n\n25\n00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.120\nAnd then I'll hold Shift and\nthen click that.\n\n26\n00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.935\nThat's about right.\n\n27\n00:01:35.935 --> 00:01:38.880\nS, just a line, a simple line.\n\n28\n00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.360\nBut now what I'm gonna do,\nI'll select the Path Selection tool.\n\n29\n00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.330\nMake sure my path is selected there.\n\n30\n00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.360\nAnd then I'm going to right-click and\n\n31\n00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.690\nthere's a bunch of options here,\nreally cool stuff you can do.\n\n32\n00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.550\nIn this case, we are going to stroke\nthe path which basically means think of\n\n33\n00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.770\ntaking a brush and stroking it or stroke\nwith a pencil, tracing it, essentially.\n\n34\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.550\nSo I'll click Stroke Path and\nright here, you have options.\n\n35\n00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.030\nDefault is Pencil which is a one\npixel stroke, very boring but\n\n36\n00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.630\nif you need to draw\na straight line quickly, and\n\n37\n00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.985\nyou don't wanna use the pencil directly,\nit's an option.\n\n38\n00:02:12.985 --> 00:02:14.753\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'll click Brush here and\n\n39\n00:02:14.753 --> 00:02:15.588\nthen if you want,\n\n40\n00:02:15.588 --> 00:02:19.340\nyou could simulate pressure if you set\nyour brush options to include pressure.\n\n41\n00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.396\nAnd that would make it so it looks like\nit'd be very light in the beginning and\n\n42\n00:02:24.396 --> 00:02:27.485\nthen start to get bigger and\nthen go back down.\n\n43\n00:02:27.485 --> 00:02:32.060\nBut we don't have those set right now,\nso I'm just gonna click OK.\n\n44\n00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.950\nNow you see here, it looks kind of fuzzy.\n\n45\n00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.000\nThat's just my brush options weren't\nset properly, so let's undo this.\n\n46\n00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.440\nAnd then to actually make it look like\nI want to I wanna go to my brush.\n\n47\n00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.219\nAnd then see here, I have a brush\nsize of 183 and a hardness of 12.\n\n48\n00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:54.469\nI kind of want it to match the circle up\nhere, so I'll change the hardness to 100\n\n49\n00:02:54.469 --> 00:03:00.260\nso it's very hard edges, no dithering,\nno feathering at the edge, not blurry.\n\n50\n00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.917\nSo I wanna change the, that size looks\na little big for what I wanna do.\n\n51\n00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.565\nLet's do a simple size like, let's do 60.\n\n52\n00:03:11.565 --> 00:03:13.480\n64 sounds good.\n\n53\n00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.650\nSo Undo, go back to there.\n\n54\n00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.194\nSo now my brush is set at 64 pixels.\n\n55\n00:03:18.194 --> 00:03:22.940\nI wanna go back down to\nthe Path Selection tool.\n\n56\n00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.010\nNow I'll right-click start path brush,\nokay, much better.\n\n57\n00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.530\n>> Very good.\n\n58\n00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.070\n>> So now I am going to,\nhow am I gonna do this?\n\n59\n00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.587\nLet's take this existing path here,\nand I will edit it.\n\n60\n00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:43.648\nLet's go back to my Convert Point Tool,\nand\n\n61\n00:03:43.648 --> 00:03:48.298\nthen I'll click on one of the anchor\npoints, and just bring it up.\n\n62\n00:03:48.298 --> 00:03:54.760\nOop, hold on, actually,\ndon't use the Convert Point Tool.\n\n63\n00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.772\nYou'd still go with\nthe Path Selection Tool, sorry.\n\n64\n00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:03.536\nI'd wanna click on this and\nthen hold Ctrl, and\n\n65\n00:04:03.536 --> 00:04:06.025\nthen that allows me to\nmove the anchor point.\n\n66\n00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:07.220\nSo I can move it up.\n\n67\n00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.820\nLet's do something, set up, so\nwhat I did, I just shortened the path.\n\n68\n00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.440\nYou'll see I'm gonna move\nit completely in a second.\n\n69\n00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.860\n>> But the stroke you applied\nto that path did not change.\n\n70\n00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.490\n>> Exactly, the stroke in the same spot\nbecause the stroke right now is on\n\n71\n00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.850\nlayer one.\n\n72\n00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.990\nSo I'm working a path now.\n\n73\n00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.198\nSo I'll use my Path Selection tool\nto move this path out of the way so\n\n74\n00:04:31.198 --> 00:04:33.240\nyou can actually see it, once.\n\n75\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.435\nAnd I'm going to click on the end, or\n\n76\n00:04:36.435 --> 00:04:42.219\nCtrl+Click on the anchor point and\nthen just move it up like this.\n\n77\n00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.240\nThere we go.\n\n78\n00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.250\nThink of it as kind of a stick figure, and\n\n79\n00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.488\nthis is the arm getting\nready to do the YMCA.\n\n80\n00:04:51.488 --> 00:04:54.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So here we have this.\n\n81\n00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.370\nNow I'm gonna stroke it again.\n\n82\n00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.215\nSo I'll right-click, Stroke Path,\nperfect, there we go.\n\n83\n00:05:00.215 --> 00:05:03.380\nNow let's do the same thing\non the other side now.\n\n84\n00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.349\nSo one, an easy way to do this,\nI prefer it, it's my preferred method\n\n85\n00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:13.596\nbecause I don't wanna free move all\nthe points again just like I just did.\n\n86\n00:05:13.596 --> 00:05:19.808\nI can actually go to Edit,\nand then let's find it,\n\n87\n00:05:19.808 --> 00:05:24.580\nTransform Points > Flip Horizontal.\n\n88\n00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.620\nThere we go.\n\n89\n00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.211\nWhoop, hold on.\n\n90\n00:05:29.211 --> 00:05:30.900\nI need to actually select my entire path.\n\n91\n00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.460\n>> And not just move the one point.\n\n92\n00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.220\n>> Yep, x out on the Direct Selection\ntool and you go to Path Selection tool.\n\n93\n00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.790\nPath is selected,\nnow I'll do Edit > Transform Path.\n\n94\n00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:42.628\nThat's what I wanted.\n\n95\n00:05:42.628 --> 00:05:44.510\nNow I'm gonna flip that horizontal,\n\n96\n00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.020\nand you can see that I just\nmade the mirror image.\n\n97\n00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.755\nSo now I'm just gonna\ndrag this over to here.\n\n98\n00:05:49.755 --> 00:05:55.315\nI'll hold Shift to keep it on the same\nline, or drag it straight over.\n\n99\n00:05:55.315 --> 00:05:56.350\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n100\n00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.540\n>> So now I'll do the same thing,\nyeah, and I'll right-click,\n\n101\n00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.177\nI'll go to Stroke Path.\n\n102\n00:06:02.177 --> 00:06:05.260\nOkay, there we go.\n\n103\n00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.300\nSo now I wanna make\nwhat would be the legs.\n\n104\n00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.137\nSo first off, let's just drag this one.\n\n105\n00:06:14.137 --> 00:06:17.363\nI can either drag this down,\nmake it bring it to this side, but\n\n106\n00:06:17.363 --> 00:06:20.980\nI'll show you how to do another thing\nwith the transform we just did.\n\n107\n00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.042\nThe vertical flip, we'll just say\nTransform Path > Flip Vertical.\n\n108\n00:06:27.042 --> 00:06:31.547\nFlips it, so\nit'll be like the mirror image below it.\n\n109\n00:06:31.547 --> 00:06:38.934\nSo drag that one down,\nThere we go, it's about right.\n\n110\n00:06:38.934 --> 00:06:43.928\nAnd then I'll right-click this,\nStore Path, good.\n\n111\n00:06:43.928 --> 00:06:48.978\nAnd then one more time,\nEdit > Transform Path > Horizontal,\n\n112\n00:06:48.978 --> 00:06:55.360\nand let's drag it over to here,\nright-click, Stroke Path > OK.\n\n113\n00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.980\n>> Pretty cool, the way you're just\nreusing that path as a way to lay down\n\n114\n00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.660\nthe stroke that you want on your image\n>> It's very helpful for\n\n115\n00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.750\nwhen you wanna be consistent.\n\n116\n00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.847\nI could have drawn each of\nthose individually, but\n\n117\n00:07:04.847 --> 00:07:08.064\nit could have been different sizes and\nI kind of want everything to be the same,\n\n118\n00:07:08.064 --> 00:07:09.845\nall of his arms and\nlegs to be the same size.\n\n119\n00:07:09.845 --> 00:07:12.000\n>> You want your stick figure\nto have legs of the same size?\n\n120\n00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.570\n>> Yes.\n\n121\n00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:18.370\nSo now what we're gonna do is make a small\nsegue into the next part of this lesson.\n\n122\n00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.465\nWe've talked a little bit about paths and\nthe Pen tool.\n\n123\n00:07:20.465 --> 00:07:25.147\nSo now we're gonna go towards the puppets.\n\n124\n00:07:25.147 --> 00:07:26.460\nPuppets are pretty cool.\n\n125\n00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.533\nLet me see,\nin this case I can just rid of this path.\n\n126\n00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:31.044\nI don't need it.\n\n127\n00:07:31.044 --> 00:07:32.568\n>> They can also be very scary,\npuppets scare me.\n\n128\n00:07:32.568 --> 00:07:38.620\n>> Definitely, yes, this one might get\nscary when we're done with it, so.\n\n129\n00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.400\nSo I just deleted my path.\n\n130\n00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.450\nI can delete these guys, too.\n\n131\n00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:46.492\nOnce you're done with what I had\nused the path as kind of an outline,\n\n132\n00:07:46.492 --> 00:07:50.836\nthey're not necessary to my\nspecific project right now.\n\n133\n00:07:50.836 --> 00:07:55.873\nSo I just let them go and\ndelete them, because I essentially\n\n134\n00:07:55.873 --> 00:08:00.123\nwas just using those to be\nable to fill in my layer.\n\n135\n00:08:00.123 --> 00:08:01.976\nKind of, I did all the coloring.\n\n136\n00:08:01.976 --> 00:08:03.195\nIt does my sketching essentially.\n\n137\n00:08:03.195 --> 00:08:03.727\n>> Right.\n\n138\n00:08:03.727 --> 00:08:04.296\nMm-hm.\n\n139\n00:08:04.296 --> 00:08:06.840\n>> And I did the coloring and\ndon't need the sketches anymore.\n\n140\n00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:11.540\nSo, now I have this one\nlayer with this guy on it.\n\n141\n00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.800\nI actually would like him to\nbe in a different pose, so.\n\n142\n00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.140\n>> Now we've got to start over again and\nredraw this.\n\n143\n00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.680\n>> Yeah, no, I don't want to do that.\n\n144\n00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.880\nIt would be another episode,\nlet's do this.\n\n145\n00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.400\nSo, what I'm gonna do is click my\nlayer one where I have this guy on.\n\n146\n00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.868\nAnd I'll go to, let me find it,\n\n147\n00:08:31.868 --> 00:08:37.670\nlayer we're gonna look for Puppet Work.\n\n148\n00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.484\nSo it should be on any of these.\n\n149\n00:08:41.484 --> 00:08:43.086\nI always have trouble finding it.\n\n150\n00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.281\nEdit, I think, there it is.\n\n151\n00:08:50.281 --> 00:08:53.568\nEdit, Puppet Warp, there we go,\nso I'll click that.\n\n152\n00:08:53.568 --> 00:09:01.377\nNow, this looks crazy, you'll see this\nkind all of these polygons and stuff.\n\n153\n00:09:01.377 --> 00:09:05.935\nThis is really cool though so what I'm\ngonna do, lets start at the bottom.\n\n154\n00:09:05.935 --> 00:09:10.375\nWhat I'm gonna do is create anchor\npoints on where, say, joints would be.\n\n155\n00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:10.936\n>> Okay.\n\n156\n00:09:10.936 --> 00:09:13.618\n>> Or the ending of an appendage and\njust so\n\n157\n00:09:13.618 --> 00:09:16.800\nlet's start with clicking\nwhere the foot is.\n\n158\n00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.870\nI'll click that once.\n\n159\n00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.010\nYou see that circle pop up there.\n\n160\n00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.710\nLet me zoom in on that just so you see it.\n\n161\n00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:24.760\nThat little circle appeared.\n\n162\n00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.900\nSo now I'll click on another part\nlike right half way through the leg,\n\n163\n00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.680\nso let's call it his knee.\n\n164\n00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.650\nLet's go make the hips right now.\n\n165\n00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.400\nActually, this should be enough for\nwhat we want.\n\n166\n00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.990\nSo I have the foot and the knee.\n\n167\n00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.140\nSo after you create those, if you just\nclick a new one you'll make new points,\n\n168\n00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.800\nbut if you click on existing point and\ndrag, cool stuff happens.\n\n169\n00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.590\nYou see, it's just kind of like-\n>> Wow.\n\n170\n00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.670\n>> Gets kind of creepy.\n\n171\n00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.960\n>> [LAUGH] Told you puppets were scary.\n\n172\n00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.480\n>> Yes.\n\n173\n00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.520\nSo let me.\n\n174\n00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.490\n>> You're basically\ncreating joints almost.\n\n175\n00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:04.180\nLike you were saying.\n\n176\n00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.505\nThen it's gonna bend\nthat shape at that joint\n\n177\n00:10:07.505 --> 00:10:10.330\n>> Yep, so let's create the hips, so\n\n178\n00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.920\nit's there, give another knee down here,\nand another foot.\n\n179\n00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:20.905\nSo let's start manipulating\npretty cool stuff.\n\n180\n00:10:20.905 --> 00:10:25.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like he's dancing.\n\n181\n00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.250\n>> Exactly.\n\n182\n00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.890\n>> So, now have that done I\nwas give him a chest area so,\n\n183\n00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:31.590\nI do the same thing here on there.\n\n184\n00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.305\nHold on, she was too tall for me.\n\n185\n00:10:35.305 --> 00:10:38.270\n[LAUGH] Then give them an elbow.\n\n186\n00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:40.630\nThen give them a hand.\n\n187\n00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:46.000\nNow let's click and drag that hand Now,\nclick and drag that elbow.\n\n188\n00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.500\nSame thing with the other elbow.\n\n189\n00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.190\nThat was a badly placed one.\n\n190\n00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.330\nI can undo, and it will just disappear.\n\n191\n00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.800\nSo that's a great thing.\n\n192\n00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.080\nHappens through all the tools.\n\n193\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.240\nElbows good.\n\n194\n00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.010\nLet's drag this elbow down a little bit.\n\n195\n00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:07.500\n>> And then we click the hand and\ndrag it up and lets give him a head too.\n\n196\n00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.728\nNow he's happy, rocking.\n\n197\n00:11:11.728 --> 00:11:13.659\n>> [LAUGH ].\n\n198\n00:11:13.659 --> 00:11:15.448\nThat was pretty darn cool.\n\n199\n00:11:15.448 --> 00:11:19.560\n>> So puppet warp is really cool\nexample if you had a photography ,have\n\n200\n00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.140\na picture of a model and\nthe pose is a little bit off.\n\n201\n00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.910\nYou can use the Puppet Warp\ntool to edit this.\n\n202\n00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:27.520\n>> Wow.\n\n203\n00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.890\n>> And you'll actually be able to\nadjust the, if you use the Puppet Warp,\n\n204\n00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:36.100\nit's really easy to see right now,\nbut if it's a normal picture?\n\n205\n00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.750\nIt would kind of manipulate\nthe background too.\n\n206\n00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.500\n>> So what you would want to do in\nthat case would be select the model.\n\n207\n00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.230\nBring it onto its own layer,\ndo the warping.\n\n208\n00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:46.470\nAnd then put it back.\n\n209\n00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.250\nAnd then probably heal\nthe areas that would've not\n\n210\n00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.090\nbeen there in the first place.\n\n211\n00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.381\n>> Kind of combine a lot of the things\nthat we've been learning about, very cool\n\n212\n00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:53.239\n>> Exactly, so\n\n213\n00:11:53.239 --> 00:11:55.895\nthat's a quick little tip right there.\n\n214\n00:11:55.895 --> 00:11:58.182\nSo I can move him wherever I want to.\n\n215\n00:11:58.182 --> 00:12:05.360\n>> [LAUGH] Now he's doing\nthe M from the YMCA.\n\n216\n00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.030\n>> Exactly.\nI could just keep going with this.\n\n217\n00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.820\nSo, puppet warp, very fun.\n\n218\n00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.440\nAnd especially creating your own\nstick figure is really cool too.\n\n219\n00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.230\nThat's awesome.\n\n220\n00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.020\nAnd then that's about right.\n\n221\n00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.380\nOnce you're finished with the puppet warp,\nlike I am now.\n\n222\n00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:20.970\nI'll click apply.\n\n223\n00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:26.522\nSo now, if you want it to dance, just keep\nhitting Ctrl+Z for your undo and redo.\n\n224\n00:12:26.522 --> 00:12:29.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Look at that he's having a good time.\n\n225\n00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.540\n>> That is very cool.\n\n226\n00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:38.380\n>> All right, so, that is Puppet warp and\nthat is the path and pen tools.\n\n227\n00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:44.790\nSo now, the next section of\nthis lesson will be channels.\n\n228\n00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:49.440\nThey are kinda related but\nthey're also just a little bit,\n\n229\n00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.250\nit's kind of out of place but-\n>> Okay.\n\n230\n00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.590\nYou can put it somewhere.\n\n231\n00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.628\n>> Exactly but I can relate it so-\n>> Okay.\n\n232\n00:12:56.628 --> 00:13:00.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So with this, let's go to a I'll keep\n\n233\n00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.430\nthis open just cuz I like it but\nI'm gonna File > Open this time.\n\n234\n00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.920\nI'll open up smoke, smoke.jpeg.\n\n235\n00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.830\nActually let's go peacock first.\n\n236\n00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.560\nOpen up the peacock picture.\n\n237\n00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.470\nSo this one is really easy\nto see that what channels do\n\n238\n00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.040\nbecause it's very colorful,\nspecifically blue.\n\n239\n00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:24.490\nSo to see your channels, they're on\nthe right side, there's a Channels window.\n\n240\n00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:30.430\nAnd then you see it has different\nselections, it has different options.\n\n241\n00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:32.090\nIt looks kinda like your Layers panel.\n\n242\n00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.885\nBut we have red, green, blue, and RGB.\n\n243\n00:13:35.885 --> 00:13:41.915\nThis is pretty much think of every\npicture has this red greens and blues.\n\n244\n00:13:41.915 --> 00:13:42.707\n>> Right.\n\n245\n00:13:42.707 --> 00:13:46.040\n>> And this is each one\nseparated onto it's own layer or\n\n246\n00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.176\nchannel in this case if you will.\n\n247\n00:13:48.176 --> 00:13:53.290\nSo remember when we\ntalked about layer masks?\n\n248\n00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.210\nAnd clipping masks, and\nwe're talking about the blacks and\n\n249\n00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.057\nwhites, the black to\nconceal white to reveal.\n\n250\n00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.840\nThat kind of goes with channels too,\njust when you look at it.\n\n251\n00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.820\nSo this peacock, what's its main color?\n\n252\n00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:07.450\n>> Blue.\n\n253\n00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.110\n>> Blue.\n\n254\n00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:13.300\nSo now if you go to blue,\nthe blue part is very white.\n\n255\n00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:18.610\nSo the more of that value in there,\nthe lighter it will be.\n\n256\n00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:23.050\nNow let's go to red you'll see there is no\n\n257\n00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:27.580\npretty close to no red in that peacocks\nbody right there so it's black.\n\n258\n00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.350\nSo the value is like technically\na zero value of red.\n\n259\n00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:35.517\n>> Okay.\n>> If zero with black and 100% with white.\n\n260\n00:14:35.517 --> 00:14:38.470\nYou could see then the green\nis kind of in the middle.\n\n261\n00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:45.440\nSo it's a cool way to see the almost\na heat map of the colors in your picture.\n\n262\n00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:51.130\nAnd that's really, you can,\nit makes for some cool effects.\n\n263\n00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:54.540\nAnd you could also beautiful one.\n\n264\n00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.400\nAnd if you were in a different image mode,\nso this is RGB image.\n\n265\n00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.790\n>> Right.\n>> If I was doing a CMYK,\n\n266\n00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.680\nI would have a cyan,\nmagenta, yellow and black.\n\n267\n00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.340\n>> So,\nyou'd have all four of those channels.\n\n268\n00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.500\n>> Yep.\n>> Plus a complete one that was CMYK.\n\n269\n00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.250\n>> Exactly.\n\n270\n00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.940\n>> Cool.\n\n271\n00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.857\n>> So\nnow I can also take some channels out, so\n\n272\n00:15:10.857 --> 00:15:14.594\nif I want to take all the red\nout of the picture, no red.\n\n273\n00:15:14.594 --> 00:15:15.274\n>> Ooh.\n\n274\n00:15:15.274 --> 00:15:17.202\n>> If I wanna take all\nthe blue out of the picture,\n\n275\n00:15:17.202 --> 00:15:19.389\nit'll probably look pretty interesting,\nthere.\n\n276\n00:15:19.389 --> 00:15:20.057\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n277\n00:15:20.057 --> 00:15:22.692\n>> And\nthen if I only want the red channel to go,\n\n278\n00:15:22.692 --> 00:15:26.410\nyou could choose the different\ncombinations of everything.\n\n279\n00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:27.990\n>> I see.\n\n280\n00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:29.912\n>> There's a good one.\n\n281\n00:15:29.912 --> 00:15:34.962\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And, if you want to,\n\n282\n00:15:34.962 --> 00:15:38.582\nyou could just adjust.\n\n283\n00:15:38.582 --> 00:15:41.203\nYou can't combine them with the full\none because the full one will just have\n\n284\n00:15:41.203 --> 00:15:41.796\nall the colors.\n\n285\n00:15:41.796 --> 00:15:42.349\n>> Right.\n\n286\n00:15:42.349 --> 00:15:45.167\n>> So that is a quick look at channels.\n\n287\n00:15:45.167 --> 00:15:47.745\n>> So primarily just a way to\nview where the colors are,\n\n288\n00:15:47.745 --> 00:15:50.626\nnot a lot as far as editing or\nmaking use of those channels?\n\n289\n00:15:50.626 --> 00:15:52.494\n>> You can make use of them in this case.\n\n290\n00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:55.042\nI'll show you a quick example of.\n\n291\n00:15:55.042 --> 00:15:57.633\nWhat I've used channels for, for a while.\n\n292\n00:15:57.633 --> 00:16:00.942\nIt's specific photo editing stuff.\n\n293\n00:16:00.942 --> 00:16:04.987\nSo, we'll come back to this peacock\nin one of the later episodes.\n\n294\n00:16:04.987 --> 00:16:07.090\n>> Okay.\n>> So, let's exit this guy right now.\n\n295\n00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:07.790\nHey, it's our guy.\n\n296\n00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:10.150\nSo let's go to File > Open.\n\n297\n00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.590\nAnd then I'll open smoked up JPEG.\n\n298\n00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:16.380\n>> Okay, here's a picture of smoke.\n\n299\n00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.270\nJust smoke on a black background.\n\n300\n00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.852\nIt may have some\nimperfections in it you see.\n\n301\n00:16:19.852 --> 00:16:24.040\nYou can probably see it,\nit's a little lighter on the left side.\n\n302\n00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.560\nIt's not a perfectly black background.\n\n303\n00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:32.360\nSo, one thing when I was doing smoke\nphotography, I always wanted to be able\n\n304\n00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:37.820\nto extract that smoke from the background,\nbecause setting it up was a real big job.\n\n305\n00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.671\nSo, I wanted to get the best picture\npossible, so I want to take that smoke and\n\n306\n00:16:41.671 --> 00:16:45.170\nput it on a black background so\nthat I can do cool effects with it.\n\n307\n00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.280\n>> I can imagine trying to select like\nthat with the tools we've learned about so\n\n308\n00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.510\nfar could be a challenge.\n\n309\n00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.400\n>> Exactly.\nYes, definitely.\n\n310\n00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.980\nSo, a really quick and\neasy way to do this,\n\n311\n00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:59.180\nit's not 100% perfect, but it's a much\nbetter way than using anything else.\n\n312\n00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.778\nSo, you see here I have\nmy Background layer.\n\n313\n00:17:02.778 --> 00:17:08.110\nIf I wanna select it, I'll just hold\ncontrol, then I'll first unlock it.\n\n314\n00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:10.470\nHold control, then click on thumbnail.\n\n315\n00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.110\nIt selects the entire rectangle.\n\n316\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:13.840\nI don't want that.\n\n317\n00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.620\nI only want the smoke part.\n\n318\n00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:18.120\nSo I could use some of\nthe selection tools.\n\n319\n00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.711\nThe pen tool won't even cut it this time.\n\n320\n00:17:19.711 --> 00:17:21.791\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Unless I wanted to be here for\n\n321\n00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:25.670\na few more years, but so\nwhat I'll do is go to the channels.\n\n322\n00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.560\nNow, let's view each\nindividual channel here.\n\n323\n00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.380\nLet's go to red.\n\n324\n00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.480\nThey all look similar.\n\n325\n00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.390\nBlue being a little bit more bright,\n\n326\n00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.716\nbecause if you can see it,\nthe whole thing has a blue tint to it.\n\n327\n00:17:36.716 --> 00:17:38.520\n>> A blue hue, yeah.\n\n328\n00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.690\n>> So what I'm gonna do is\nselect the darkest one.\n\n329\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.300\nThis is a really,\nit doesn't matter which one you select,\n\n330\n00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.900\nyou'll get the same results\neither way pretty much.\n\n331\n00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.030\nBut in this case, I'm gonna go with\nthe darkest one because I wanna\n\n332\n00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.289\nput it on a solid black background.\n\n333\n00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.770\nSo I'll hold Ctrl and\nclick on thumbnail this.\n\n334\n00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.660\nThat selects only the red\nchannel throughout this.\n\n335\n00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:06.785\nSo, now I can press Ctrl+C or\nCmd+C on the keyboard to copy that.\n\n336\n00:18:06.785 --> 00:18:11.400\nThen I'll go to my layers window,\nI'll create a new layer\n\n337\n00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:17.230\nand then I will Ctrl+V to paste it.\n\n338\n00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:22.360\nSo, I'll make the original invisible so\nyou can see or not see.\n\n339\n00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:27.160\nSo that's, you can see it's a little bit-\n>> I can see it there, yeah.\n\n340\n00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:27.970\n>> It's there.\n\n341\n00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:30.230\nIt's just very smokey, if you will.\n\n342\n00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.030\nLet's create a new layer below that, and\n\n343\n00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.460\nthen I'll fill that in\njust with a paint bucket.\n\n344\n00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.190\nBlack.\n\n345\n00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.710\nSo now,\nwe have our smoke on a black background.\n\n346\n00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.120\n>> On a perfectly black background now.\n\n347\n00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:42.970\n>> Somewhat perfectly.\n\n348\n00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.880\nVisually, it's perfect right now.\n\n349\n00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.110\nBut if I wanted to edit this, I can\nhold control, click on the thumbnail,\n\n350\n00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.050\nmake that selection again and\nthen I'm gonna add some cool colors to it.\n\n351\n00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:55.870\nSo, I'll hold on my paint bucket,\ngo to the gradient.\n\n352\n00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.460\nAnd I've selected this\nreally cool rainbow there.\n\n353\n00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.320\nAnd now,\nI'll make this on a new layer, just so\n\n354\n00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.570\nI don't mess up any layers below it.\n\n355\n00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:08.871\nAnd I'll just click from the bottom\nleft and drag to the top right.\n\n356\n00:19:10.667 --> 00:19:11.310\n>> Wow.\n\n357\n00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:12.450\n>> Cool effect, right there.\n\n358\n00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:16.230\nBut you can see it's not perfectly black,\n\n359\n00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:20.170\nbecause it kinda changed part of\nthe background to be multicolored.\n\n360\n00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:25.406\nSo to fix this, it's just a simple, pull\nout your eraser, and go to town on it.\n\n361\n00:19:25.406 --> 00:19:26.380\n>> Okay.\n>> So, that's easy.\n\n362\n00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.520\nJust clean it up.\n\n363\n00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.640\nAnd being that it's only a color layer,\nit's really,\n\n364\n00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.760\nif you mess up it's not noticeable.\n\n365\n00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:37.960\nI could just do that, and you can\nbarely see the lack of color there.\n\n366\n00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.805\nSo, I'll clean that up.\n\n367\n00:19:39.805 --> 00:19:43.950\nAand then right now I\nhave my colorful smoke.\n\n368\n00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.160\nSay I wanted to change\nthe background to white.\n\n369\n00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.580\nI can just click on the background layer,\nhold Ctrl, press I.\n\n370\n00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.990\nChange that, and\nnow it's looking really bright.\n\n371\n00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:58.080\nSo, I can actually\nmanipulate this further.\n\n372\n00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.750\nLet me invert the original smoke.\n\n373\n00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:03.370\nSo having fun with this,\njust doing different things,\n\n374\n00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:07.100\ninverting certain layers and\nyou can have some really cool effects.\n\n375\n00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:11.322\nAnd I have this really neat looking\nmulticolored smoke on a white background\n\n376\n00:20:11.322 --> 00:20:11.864\nnow.\n\n377\n00:20:11.864 --> 00:20:14.170\nSo, it looks way more abstract this way.\n\n378\n00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.410\nIt's a pretty cool effect, so.\n\n379\n00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:17.060\n>> Very good.\n\n380\n00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:23.642\n>> Yeah, and then, to tie this all in with\nthe pen tool, let's just create a path.\n\n381\n00:20:23.642 --> 00:20:25.036\nPen tool.\n\n382\n00:20:25.036 --> 00:20:30.180\nLet's do a simple circle.\n\n383\n00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.960\nLet's do, well, circles are boring.\n\n384\n00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.460\nLet's do a crazy shape.\n\n385\n00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:38.044\nSomething like this, then let's move.\n\n386\n00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.144\nIt's a crazy,\nI don't even know what to call this shape.\n\n387\n00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:52.419\nThere we go.\n\n388\n00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:54.040\nSo now I have a shape there, a path.\n\n389\n00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.580\nKind of difficult to see, but\nI'll put it right in this area.\n\n390\n00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:02.885\nWhat I can do, I'll right-click on here,\nand then do something.\n\n391\n00:21:02.885 --> 00:21:04.710\nCreate a vector mask.\n\n392\n00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:08.360\nJust like a clipping mask,\njust like a layer mask, but with vectors.\n\n393\n00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.430\nSo now,\nyou see only a portion of this is colored.\n\n394\n00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:16.060\nSo this kinda ties\neverything back together.\n\n395\n00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.390\n>> Very cool.\n\n396\n00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:18.230\nAll right, Nick.\n\n397\n00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:22.500\nA very good look at some of the more\ncomplex things we can do inside Photoshop.\n\n398\n00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.440\nWe took a look at the,\nin the previous episode, or\n\n399\n00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.990\npart one, we saw a really\ngood look at that pen tool.\n\n400\n00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:32.640\nAnd then, in this episode, we've worked\nour through our, let's see, the puppet.\n\n401\n00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.280\nI mean, how can we forget\nthe dancing stick figure?\n\n402\n00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.930\nAnd then,\ntaking a look at channels and some\n\n403\n00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:41.590\nof the really cool effects we can come\nup if we work with that channels panel.\n\n404\n00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:42.530\nSo, we thank you for that Nick.\n\n405\n00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:43.820\nGreat demonstrations.\n\n406\n00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.530\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n407\n00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.840\nSigning out for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n408\n00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.228\n>> And I'm Nick Page.\n\n409\n00:21:49.228 --> 00:21:55.580\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n410\n00:21:55.580 -->

00:00:20.408\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we are doing Adobe Photoshop CC2015.\n\n4\n00:00:20.408 --> 00:00:24.560\nAnd specifically in this episode it's time\nfor another one of those try-it-outs.\n\n5\n00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.440\nIn this on we are gonna be\nusing the good old pen tool.\n\n6\n00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.210\nHere to help us with that is Mr.\nNick Page.\n\n7\n00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.140\nHow are you doing, Nick?\n\n8\n00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.290\n>> Pretty good,\nvery excited to do this pen tool.\n\n9\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.010\nSo let's dive right into Photoshop,\nand let's start off.\n\n10\n00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.760\nSo I'm gonna go to Photoshop,\nand then I'll go to File > Open.\n\n11\n00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.670\nAnd then I'm gonna open the peacock,\n\n12\n00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.500\nthat we saw in the last episode,\nvery friendly guy.\n\n13\n00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.640\nWhat we're gonna do here,\nis try to trace out part of him.\n\n14\n00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.878\nI particularly am fond\nof this blue body parts.\n\n15\n00:00:53.878 --> 00:00:57.139\nSo we will see how this works, for\n\n16\n00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:00.661\nyour viewing pleasure I guess\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:03.006\n>> I will be putting a bit of white paint\n\n18\n00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:07.456\non top of it just so you can see\nthe stroke a lot easier of the pen tool,\n\n19\n00:01:07.456 --> 00:01:09.821\nyou'll see what I mean in a second.\n\n20\n00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:12.830\nSo first I'll unlock the peacock layer.\n\n21\n00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.460\nAnd then let me just start\nby doing a pen tool sample.\n\n22\n00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.080\nSo that is what you would normally have.\n\n23\n00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.750\nYou cannot see that at all.\n\n24\n00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.110\nSo I will make this little edit for you.\n\n25\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.700\nNot necessary on your end just so\nyou can see what I am doing.\n\n26\n00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.390\nI'll just scribble a bunch of light here.\n\n27\n00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.980\nAnd then change the opacity down so\n\n28\n00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.660\nnow we could see the peacock and\nwe could see the line a little bit better.\n\n29\n00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.970\n>> Very clever, could actually be\nuseful when you're trying to do a photo\n\n30\n00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.550\nthat's got a lot of or\nnot a lot of contrast there.\n\n31\n00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.140\n>> Definitely, so\nI'm gonna go back and undo this.\n\n32\n00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.700\nNo, can't undo that.\n\n33\n00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.600\nLet's redo this.\n\n34\n00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.430\nNow I'll delete this path that I just\ncreated and actually, there we go,\n\n35\n00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.300\nselect it, and then hit delete.\n\n36\n00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.100\nSo back to the Pen tool.\n\n37\n00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.520\nNow looking at an image like this,\nit's very complex.\n\n38\n00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.900\nYou don't really know where to start.\n\n39\n00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.340\nAnd where to start is\ncompletely up to you, but\n\n40\n00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.090\nusually I like to start\non part of a curve.\n\n41\n00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.070\nBut it really doesn't matter,\nit's more you use the pen tool,\n\n42\n00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.330\nyou'll develop favorite places on\nwhat style, what contour to start at.\n\n43\n00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.275\nSo in this case, I also like to start on\nthe left side if you haven't noticed.\n\n44\n00:02:31.275 --> 00:02:33.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'll start on the left side.\n\n45\n00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.149\nClick, let me zoom in a little bit.\n\n46\n00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.160\nOops sorry.\n\n47\n00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.420\nOkay, I’ll click right here,\nstarting point.\n\n48\n00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.980\nNow I will look at the,\n\n49\n00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.640\nhow this peacock’s neck goes up and\nlet’s start with this first curve here.\n\n50\n00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.260\nSo I'll probably bring it\nup to just about here and\n\n51\n00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.000\nthen start manipulating my handles.\n\n52\n00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.790\nUntil it looks just about right.\n\n53\n00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.390\nThat looks good to me.\n\n54\n00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.630\nThere we go and when you see it do\nthat I'm kind of setting up for\n\n55\n00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.760\nmy next anchor point.\n\n56\n00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.170\nBecause now if I just click here you\n\n57\n00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.550\nsee it kind of pretty much\nmakes that what I wanted to be.\n\n58\n00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.970\nThat's not always the case.\n\n59\n00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.310\nI'll show you later on but this one let\nme zoom it a little more so you can see\n\n60\n00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.350\nit a little better and then change its\nopacity of this guy just, there we go.\n\n61\n00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.470\nSo I'll make the next point right here.\n\n62\n00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.420\nSee it's a little bit off but I'm just\ngonna, when you're still holding and\n\n63\n00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.610\nwhile you're able to drag your handles.\n\n64\n00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.880\nI can hold the space bar while\nI'm still holding the mouse and\n\n65\n00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.880\nfloat that anchor point, so I could.\n\n66\n00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.560\n>> So you click just a little bit off.\n\n67\n00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.540\nYou can actually move the point and\n\n68\n00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.400\nstill work with the handles\nall at the same time.\n\n69\n00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.900\n>> Exactly.\n\n70\n00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.110\n>> Wow.\n>> So now you see this,\n\n71\n00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.080\nI can't really get this to go\nhow I want it to because of that\n\n72\n00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.410\nhandle on the right side that are staying\nthere so let's put it as close as I can so\n\n73\n00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.080\nI'll start right here and\nthen I'm gonna edit this handle.\n\n74\n00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.500\nUsually I'll go to the convert point tool\nbut being that we want to kind of learn\n\n75\n00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.590\na little bit more about the pen\ntool I want to use the pen tool.\n\n76\n00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.860\nSo pen tool has a lot of shortcuts to it.\n\n77\n00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.550\nIf you hold Ctrl, it would get\nyou to the direct selection tool.\n\n78\n00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.588\nSo holding Ctrl brings you to that.\n\n79\n00:04:32.588 --> 00:04:38.330\nAnd then holding Alt will change\nit to the convert point tool.\n\n80\n00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.710\nSo it's if you wanna make your edits\non the fly without having to switch\n\n81\n00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.070\ntools, and.\n\n82\n00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.820\n>> Very convenient.\n\n83\n00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.348\n>> Very convenient.\n\n84\n00:04:45.348 --> 00:04:48.361\nSo I'll be doing a lot of that and\nwhenever I'd do it I'll say\n\n85\n00:04:48.361 --> 00:04:52.084\nI'm holding alt and changing or\nholding control or holding shift, just so\n\n86\n00:04:52.084 --> 00:04:55.360\nyou can see and visualize what\nI'm doing to see what's going on.\n\n87\n00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.230\nSo I'm going to convert this\npoint a little bit, so hold Alt.\n\n88\n00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.123\nThen drag it up a little,\ndrag it down a little bit,\n\n89\n00:05:05.123 --> 00:05:08.130\njust to kinda fit that curve properly.\n\n90\n00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.640\nSo now let's go to the next point.\n\n91\n00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.940\nLet's go right about here,\nand see what happens.\n\n92\n00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.650\nOops, I still have this,\nthis portion selected.\n\n93\n00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.030\nSo need to select whether that before\nright there so I'm clicking on that.\n\n94\n00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.000\nLet me see if that works.\n\n95\n00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.858\nIt still didn't work.\n\n96\n00:05:27.858 --> 00:05:32.138\nLet's go to direct.\n\n97\n00:05:32.138 --> 00:05:34.958\nIs that going to work?\n\n98\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:35.898\nNope.\n\n99\n00:05:35.898 --> 00:05:39.280\nSometimes you'll see this problem if\nyou kind of left off your path and\n\n100\n00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.635\nyou wanna get back onto it.\n\n101\n00:05:40.635 --> 00:05:42.090\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n102\n00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.725\n>> Just that, that work.\n\n103\n00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:44.722\nThere we go.\n\n104\n00:05:44.722 --> 00:05:48.070\nIf you have your pen tool you wanna\nclick on that last path you did and\n\n105\n00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.310\nyou would see a hold on and I'll show you.\n\n106\n00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.950\nYou see this little\ncircle with a square and\n\n107\n00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.910\na line through it right there,\non the bottom right of the pen logo.\n\n108\n00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.460\nThat means it will kind of\n\n109\n00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.650\ncreate your path your start from\nthis point continue exactly.\n\n110\n00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.460\nSo let's go on to our next\npiece That's right about here.\n\n111\n00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.920\nSo I'll click, and then drag it to kind\nof make it look a little nice like that.\n\n112\n00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.350\nAnd then as I'm going through\nI'm gonna probably edit\n\n113\n00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.840\nthis back piece just a little\nbit just to kinda fit it more.\n\n114\n00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.480\nSo hold Alt and adjust this a little\nfurther then go back up to here.\n\n115\n00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.960\nTake the next point.\n\n116\n00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.990\nThere we go.\nAnd then I'll zoom in so\n\n117\n00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.250\nwe can see this a little more clearly.\n\n118\n00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.220\nLet me hold that Ctrl here and\njust move it a little bit.\n\n119\n00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.430\nBecause you can see at the point\nof this beak It's a little curved.\n\n120\n00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.000\nSo, kinda hit that curve right.\n\n121\n00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.680\nNow I'll do this, and then drag out.\n\n122\n00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.585\nThere we go.\n\n123\n00:06:55.585 --> 00:07:04.340\nAnd then make further changes.\n\n124\n00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.250\nI don't like that curve that much.\n\n125\n00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:12.210\nSo when you're doing this, see this handle\nis kind of gonna affect my next line.\n\n126\n00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:17.090\nIf I don't want it to, I can change my,\nuse my convert point tool\n\n127\n00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.740\nto drag it back, so\nit doesn't affect the next line as much.\n\n128\n00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.100\nOr I can make it go in\na different direction.\n\n129\n00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.010\n>> With those brazier handles there\nthe longer the handle the more\n\n130\n00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.600\npowerful the effect would\nyou say on the curve.\n\n131\n00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.230\n>> Over time it's one of the things\nlike if you you had a, let's see for\n\n132\n00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.200\nexample these right here.\n\n133\n00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.730\nThe longer the handle it\nwould pull it up more but\n\n134\n00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:43.680\nif I had a short handle and up you'd see\nit would kind just depends on how the.\n\n135\n00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.320\n>> Okay.\n\n136\n00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.870\n>> It's like a ration of length of\nthe handle to the angle of the handle.\n\n137\n00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.900\n>> Okay, so it really just goes\nback to your earlier point,\n\n138\n00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.260\na lot of practice with the pen tool.\n\n139\n00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:58.180\n>> Exactly, working with these handles\nit can be a nightmare sometimes.\n\n140\n00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.920\nBut I'm gonna try to make it not\nseem that difficult for you guys.\n\n141\n00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.970\nSo let's check up here see if\nwe can get a good curve going.\n\n142\n00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:12.200\nLooks pretty decent then let's keep\nmoving along and holding space bar and\n\n143\n00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.090\nclicking and dragging to move it on\nzoomed in so it's easier to navigate.\n\n144\n00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:21.759\nThen let's go next spot probably\naround here see how that works.\n\n145\n00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.960\nLooking pretty good so\nfar I'm holding space to move my point.\n\n146\n00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.785\nAnd then,\nnow you see how far out that handle is?\n\n147\n00:08:31.785 --> 00:08:32.300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n148\n00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.138\n>> That's not gonna be good,\nwhen I want to put a point here.\n\n149\n00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:35.274\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n150\n00:08:35.274 --> 00:08:38.888\n>> So let me redo that last point,\nand show you a little trick.\n\n151\n00:08:38.888 --> 00:08:44.060\nHold Ctrl+Alt+Z to step back one\nmore lets remake this point.\n\n152\n00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:49.400\nSo I will click right here and drag, make\nsure it looks good on the left side and\n\n153\n00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.170\nthen once I determine my left\nside is good I will hold Alt.\n\n154\n00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.230\nAnd that will affect,\nby holding Alt while still clicking and\n\n155\n00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:04.570\ndragging, I'm only now manipulating\nthe handle of the future.\n\n156\n00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.980\n>> Made each side be\nindependent of each other now.\n\n157\n00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.470\n>> Yep so\nnow it's only controlling the next\n\n158\n00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.320\npoints curve strength on the left\nside if that makes sense.\n\n159\n00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.520\n>> Yes it does.\n\n160\n00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.940\n>> So I'm gonna now just make\nthat a little shorter so\n\n161\n00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.390\nit's not as really\ndominant as it was before.\n\n162\n00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:26.130\nAnd with this I don't really\nwanna select these guys.\n\n163\n00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.200\nJust cuz you'll see why in a second.\n\n164\n00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.330\nI'm just gonna go down to here.\n\n165\n00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.310\nKinda chop off his hair.\n\n166\n00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.920\nHow about that.\n\n167\n00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.270\nAnd make sure that aligns relatively good.\n\n168\n00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.540\nThere we go.\nAnd then I'll pull this in,\n\n169\n00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.820\nhold Alt to pull in the handle.\n\n170\n00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.130\nAnd just keep going down\nthe back of the neck.\n\n171\n00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.742\nThere we go.\n\n172\n00:09:54.742 --> 00:09:58.100\nNow this point,\nI wanna put one right here.\n\n173\n00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:05.460\nSo now, it's hard to get this one really\nperfect so I'm gonna hold Alt and\n\n174\n00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.790\njust Ctrl at this point just to\nmodify just it a little bit so\n\n175\n00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.040\nit goes along nicely with the curve.\n\n176\n00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.210\nThere we go.\nAnd then over here,\n\n177\n00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.310\nI just want the basic shape of it.\n\n178\n00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:25.720\nSo I'm gonna, this one,\nyou'll see how my handle is out here, so\n\n179\n00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.260\nI'll click over here.\n\n180\n00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.500\nThat is not the curve that I want.\n\n181\n00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.460\nSo it's gonna be really hard if I do that,\nit kind of goes back on itself.\n\n182\n00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.395\n>> Right.\n>> So it's not really,\n\n183\n00:10:36.395 --> 00:10:38.005\nthis is something you\nkind of want to avoid.\n\n184\n00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:40.195\nThis right here.\n\n185\n00:10:41.365 --> 00:10:43.095\nSo let's undo that.\n\n186\n00:10:43.095 --> 00:10:45.985\nAnd then to solve that,\nI'll do what we were doing before,\n\n187\n00:10:45.985 --> 00:10:49.895\nhold Alt, take this point and\nthen just bring it in.\n\n188\n00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:52.900\nMaybe bring it a little to the right,\n\n189\n00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.870\ncuz I kinda wanna make it go towards\nthe next point that I'm doing.\n\n190\n00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.750\nSo, in this case, I'll just put it over\nto the right a little bit like that.\n\n191\n00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.890\nAnd then I'll remake this, and\nthat's a little bit better.\n\n192\n00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:08.640\nSo in this particular case,\nthere is a corner there and\n\n193\n00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.840\nthat's perfectly fine for\nwhat I want it for the curve before.\n\n194\n00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.280\nBefore I had to edit that point\n\n195\n00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.850\nit assumed I want to maintain a smooth\ncurve throughout the whole thing.\n\n196\n00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.255\nThis if you grab the handles in you\ncan do more like tighter turns.\n\n197\n00:11:21.255 --> 00:11:22.598\n>> Okay.\n\n198\n00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:27.150\n>> So going back through this more,\nthat's looking good, hold on.\n\n199\n00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.220\nThere we go.\n\n200\n00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.050\nI just want the basic shape of it, so\nI don't want to go too crazy with it.\n\n201\n00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.050\nActually I want to go straighten\nthis up a little bit.\n\n202\n00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.600\nSo I wanna hold Ctrl and\nthen click on this anchor point and\n\n203\n00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.340\nthis should kind of bring it back over.\n\n204\n00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.960\nAnd then let's see what this\nbig picture looks like.\n\n205\n00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.330\nSee the tail just kind of goes out there?\n\n206\n00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.775\nI don't wanna scaly fish part.\n\n207\n00:11:52.775 --> 00:11:57.678\n[LAUGH] So, let's go to right about here,\n\n208\n00:11:57.678 --> 00:12:01.016\nthere we go.\n\n209\n00:12:01.016 --> 00:12:03.130\nThen how's that look?\n\n210\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.790\nThat should be fine for now.\n\n211\n00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.880\nAnd then going down to the other part,\n\n212\n00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:15.125\nthey'll see this will create a weird,\nkind of a turn there.\n\n213\n00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:16.660\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n214\n00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.920\n>> As another point,\nwanna adjust this handle in the back.\n\n215\n00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.500\nLet's hold Alt and click that and\n\n216\n00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.010\njust kind of modify it to\nhow we want it to fit.\n\n217\n00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:33.360\nSo now it fits a lot tighter now,\nso it's really helpful like\n\n218\n00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.340\nmodifying each side of the anchor point\nbecause there's two handles so and\n\n219\n00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.280\nthen the inner handles will\naffect that current line segment.\n\n220\n00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.750\nSo, let's go to the next one here.\n\n221\n00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.060\nLet's just, how far can I get this one.\n\n222\n00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:55.080\nThere we go.\nI'll chop off his feet too because they\n\n223\n00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.977\ndon't work with the shape\nthat I wanna make.\n\n224\n00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.680\nNow you see how I'm pulling out\nto the right, that's incorrect.\n\n225\n00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.340\nBecause I want to go\ntowards the next point.\n\n226\n00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.520\nIn this case I'm still going clockwise so\n\n227\n00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.070\nI'd actually want to pull left\nto avoid doing the swirly thing.\n\n228\n00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.950\nSo now this one's made a little too close,\n\n229\n00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:18.160\nso I'm gonna hold spacebar just\nto drag it out a little further.\n\n230\n00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.480\nOkay, and edit this side holding Alt.\n\n231\n00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.910\nTurns out more like that, let's make\nthis one a little tweak there too,\n\n232\n00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.510\nand then let's go to the next point.\n\n233\n00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.840\nWhere am I?\n\n234\n00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.640\nI might be able, I'm trying to get this\ndone like the least amount of anchor\n\n235\n00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.860\npoints So, if you see a big curve\nlike this, you think you could do it?\n\n236\n00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.780\nTry it?\n\n237\n00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:42.750\nSo, let's go.\n\n238\n00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.630\nI'm gonna click and hold on here, and\n\n239\n00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.070\nthen drag out anchor points\nto try to make it fit.\n\n240\n00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.090\nSo, click and hold.\n\n241\n00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.280\nNow, see this happens sometimes, too.\n\n242\n00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.760\nIf you drag out the points so far, and\n\n243\n00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.390\nyou're still zoomed in it\nwill start scrolling you.\n\n244\n00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:01.870\n>> So if this happens, I'd recommend this\nto kind of get estimating where we go.\n\n245\n00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:02.760\nThat looks good right there.\n\n246\n00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.140\nAt least, and now my point is so far out.\n\n247\n00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.590\nBut it actually really good.\n\n248\n00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:08.850\n>> Perfect.\n>> Yeah, so\n\n249\n00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:13.650\nif I wanted to edit anything on there,\nI can go to my direct slash and tool, and\n\n250\n00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.940\nthen select that actual, Segment.\n\n251\n00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.050\nSo right here I could probably\nbring this down a little bit.\n\n252\n00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.840\nSo I'll just hold Alt.\n\n253\n00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.370\nDrag this down like that, and there we go.\n\n254\n00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.940\nSo, now I have a completed path.\n\n255\n00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.270\nSee, that is a path right there.\n\n256\n00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:37.390\nAnd then let's take out these\nthings just so you can see.\n\n257\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.420\nSo you see on the transparent background\nyou can see the exact shape I made.\n\n258\n00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:45.990\nAnd then let's paint in,\njust paint a white background just so\n\n259\n00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.020\nwe can see it a little bit easier.\n\n260\n00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.250\nSo that's the shape that I just made.\n\n261\n00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:57.080\nI'm going to go to the path selection\ntool and now this selects the whole path,\n\n262\n00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.570\nremember the direct selection\nselects segments of the path,\n\n263\n00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:04.530\nso with the path selection tool,\nmake sure the whole path is selected.\n\n264\n00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:09.060\nAnd what I wanna do here,\nI'll go to, [INAUDIBLE] on this one.\n\n265\n00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.480\nYes, right-click the path and\nthen go to Define Custom Shape.\n\n266\n00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.765\nI'll name this Ducky.\n\n267\n00:15:17.765 --> 00:15:21.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because it's pretty cool how\n\n268\n00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.690\nthe peacock turned into a duck, right?\n\n269\n00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.120\nIt's a pretty good looking duck too.\n\n270\n00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.170\nSo it's pretty interesting.\n\n271\n00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.640\nSo now, I defined a custom shape.\n\n272\n00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:35.110\nIf you wanted to create this let's go to\nour paths window and select this path.\n\n273\n00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.900\nI'll just click on the blank\nspace in the window, done.\n\n274\n00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.840\nSo back to my Layers.\n\n275\n00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.680\nI'll create a new layer.\n\n276\n00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.600\nAnd then let's go to Custom Shape Tool.\n\n277\n00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.910\nIt's under where the rectangle,\nrounded rectangle, it's at the bottom.\n\n278\n00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.740\nSo I'll go into that.\n\n279\n00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.620\nAnd then on the right side, the top right\nwhere you would select the shape you would\n\n280\n00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.606\nhave right at the end is\nthe shape we just created.\n\n281\n00:15:54.606 --> 00:15:58.320\nSo double-click on that and\nI would set my foreground and\n\n282\n00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.120\nbackground also\nthe foreground color to back.\n\n283\n00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:05.040\nSo it's really ease to see and then now\nI gonna click and drug it out then hold\n\n284\n00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.850\nshift to maintain proportions constrain\nand there we go there's our duck.\n\n285\n00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.775\nWe created a duck out of a peacock.\n\n286\n00:16:12.775 --> 00:16:15.090\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> And turned it into a shape.\n\n287\n00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:15.900\n>> Who would have thought.\n\n288\n00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:20.270\n>> Exactly, so now this is really\ncool it kind of shows the selection\n\n289\n00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.680\nabilities of the pen tool and paths.\n\n290\n00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.220\nIn this case we took it and\n\n291\n00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.740\nconverted the path into a custom shape but\nimagine doing this with a logo.\n\n292\n00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:35.370\nIf you took a company logo with\na path make a shape out of it and\n\n293\n00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.590\nthen you can scale the shape\nto whatever size you want to.\n\n294\n00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:40.360\nWith this case I can take this duck and\nI can put on the billboard and\n\n295\n00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.070\nit will be a great quality.\n\n296\n00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:43.490\n>> Because it was based on that vector.\n\n297\n00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.830\n>> It starts off as vector.\n\n298\n00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:50.880\nSo now, at this point it's still vector\nbut I can also rasterize it and it turn\n\n299\n00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.349\nit into pixels by right clicking on the\nlayer and then going to Rasterize Layer.\n\n300\n00:16:56.386 --> 00:17:00.870\nSo then I can zoom in to it a bunch and\nyou can start seeing the pixels.\n\n301\n00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:01.510\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n302\n00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.760\n>> Jagged it gets.\n\n303\n00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.480\nAnd then if I wanna to blow\nthis up onto a billboard\n\n304\n00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.140\nit won't be as good quality\nbecause it's not vector anymore.\n\n305\n00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.050\n>> Very cool.\n\n306\n00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.250\n>> So, yeah.\n\n307\n00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:13.130\n>> Alright Nick, a lot of great stuff\nthere, a lot of fun we can have with that\n\n308\n00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.960\npen tool,\nshowing you some of the complexities.\n\n309\n00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.880\nWorking with that pen tool,\nremember, practice makes perfect.\n\n310\n00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.510\nWe started out with a peacock.\n\n311\n00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.280\nWe ended up with a duck.\n\n312\n00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.460\nAll right, we appreciate that.\n\n313\n00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.160\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n314\n00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.500\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n315\n00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.898\n>> And I'm Mick

at IT Pro Tv.\n\n4\n00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.290\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.782\nToday we're doing Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n6\n00:00:20.782 --> 00:00:24.646\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna be taking a look at colors, right,\n\n7\n00:00:24.646 --> 00:00:28.006\nand it seems like a relatively simple\nthing but when it comes down to it,\n\n8\n00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:31.320\nthere's a lot of things to think\nabout when we're looking at colors.\n\n9\n00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.890\nAnd here to help us with all this is Ms.\nKara Page, how's it going Kara?\n\n10\n00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.340\n>> I'm great, let's go ahead and\ndive right into color.\n\n11\n00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.780\n>> All right.\n\n12\n00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.670\n>> All right, so\n\n13\n00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.240\nwhat we're going to do first is\njust talk about color terminology.\n\n14\n00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.350\nSo these are terms that you\nmay have heard before, but\n\n15\n00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.900\nyou don't really know what they mean.\n\n16\n00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.230\nSo let's start there to\njust give you a basis.\n\n17\n00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.410\nSo, the word color.\n\n18\n00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.220\nThe layman's term for color,\nit's actually called hue.\n\n19\n00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.480\nSo if you hear the word hue,\nit's just another name for color.\n\n20\n00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.000\nSo red, green blue.\n\n21\n00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.090\nThose are all hues, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.020\nThen we have something called a tent.\n\n23\n00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.830\nSo a tent is where you mix\nyour hue with a white.\n\n24\n00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.154\nSo red becoming pink.\n\n25\n00:01:14.154 --> 00:01:16.030\nPink is the tint of red.\n\n26\n00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.750\nAnd you also have shade so shade, if you\nthink of it as being under a big tree.\n\n27\n00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.530\nYou have that dark shade.\n\n28\n00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.120\nThat's where you add black to a color so\nblue to navy blue or red to maroon.\n\n29\n00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.980\nThen there's a term called Chroma.\n\n30\n00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.660\nSo Chroma is how pure that hue is so\nthe higher\n\n31\n00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.330\nthe chroma the less likely the color is\nto have been mixed with any other color.\n\n32\n00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.700\n>> Very good.\n\n33\n00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.960\n>> Okay and then the last term for\n\n34\n00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.750\ncolor that I wanna go over\nspecifically is value.\n\n35\n00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.680\nSo value refers to the lightness or\ndarkness of a hue.\n\n36\n00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.640\n>> Mm.\nOkay.\n\n37\n00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.992\n>> So, now that I have bored\nyou with some key terms.\n\n38\n00:01:57.992 --> 00:01:58.504\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n39\n00:01:58.504 --> 00:02:00.824\n>> Let's go ahead and open Photoshop.\n\n40\n00:02:00.824 --> 00:02:03.490\nSo, get Photoshop ready to go.\n\n41\n00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.600\nAnd I'm just going to\ncreate a new document.\n\n42\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.140\nI'm just gonna do maybe an eight and\na half by 11 standard document size.\n\n43\n00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.820\nIt really doesn't matter what size we're\ndoing cuz we're just playing around\n\n44\n00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.060\nwith some colors.\n\n45\n00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.220\nSo I'm gonna go to File, New.\n\n46\n00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.740\nAnd I'm going to change my\ndocument type to US paper,\n\n47\n00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.920\nwhich is one of our presets\nthat we learned about earlier.\n\n48\n00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.990\nOkay, I'm gonna go ahead and click OK.\n\n49\n00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.590\nAll right, so\nnow we have our blank canvas.\n\n50\n00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.960\nWe have our nice white page up.\n\n51\n00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.710\nNow we need to talk about colors.\n\n52\n00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.530\nSo first thing that we need to talk about\nis foreground and background colors.\n\n53\n00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.590\nIf you notice, down in the bottom left\npart of your tools panel in Photoshop,\n\n54\n00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.280\nyou'll see a black box\noverlapping a white box.\n\n55\n00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.420\nThis is your foreground and\nbackground color.\n\n56\n00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.800\nIf you hover the box, it'll tell you.\n\n57\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.200\nSo white, right now,\nis our background color.\n\n58\n00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.550\nThat is the default in Photoshop.\n\n59\n00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.950\nAnd then black is our foreground color.\n\n60\n00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.030\nSo, let's see what that means.\n\n61\n00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.600\nLet's go ahead and pull up the brush\ntool like we did the other day.\n\n62\n00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.890\nNow that you know about it,\nI'm going to go ahead and\n\n63\n00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.920\nchange this maybe to a 50 pixel brush.\n\n64\n00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.322\nAgain, it doesn't matter,\nwe're not actually creating anything.\n\n65\n00:03:12.322 --> 00:03:16.565\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So, I'm just going to scribble.\n\n66\n00:03:16.565 --> 00:03:21.940\nSo, we have this foreground color, which\nmeans that whatever tool you have active,\n\n67\n00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.660\nthat top color, your foreground color\nis going to be what color it displays.\n\n68\n00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.920\nSo let's try that out\nwith a different color.\n\n69\n00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.960\nTo pick a color from our foreground and\n\n70\n00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.730\nbackground colors,\nwe will need to click on the box.\n\n71\n00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.000\nSo if we single click on our black box,\n\n72\n00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.520\nyou will notice that we have this\nwhole color spectrum pop up.\n\n73\n00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.910\nNow I'm just going to\npick our red right here.\n\n74\n00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.260\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n75\n00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.450\nGo ahead and click okay.\n\n76\n00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:53.174\nNow we have a different foreground color,\nso when we draw we have red now.\n\n77\n00:03:53.174 --> 00:03:54.430\nOkay?\n\n78\n00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.630\nSo I'm going to switch\nback to my default colors.\n\n79\n00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.880\nIt's this little tiny icon with the black\nbox overlapping the white, right here.\n\n80\n00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.436\nOr, you can hit the D for Default.\n\n81\n00:04:06.436 --> 00:04:10.909\nSo, it's very helpful to know these\nkeyboard shortcuts in Photoshop,\n\n82\n00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.748\nespecially when we start to learn things\nlike glare masks that are based on this\n\n83\n00:04:15.748 --> 00:04:17.992\nblack-and-white color scheme.\n\n84\n00:04:17.992 --> 00:04:20.580\nAll right,\nlet's say that we wanted something else,\n\n85\n00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.190\nso let's say that we wanted our foreground\ncolor to be our background color.\n\n86\n00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.080\nHow you do that is you'll notice\nthat we have these two arrows\n\n87\n00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.770\noff to the right that look like a corner.\n\n88\n00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.350\nIf you were to click that button,\nit will change what our foreground and\n\n89\n00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.240\nbackground colors are.\n\n90\n00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.997\nSo now that we have our\nbrush still active,\n\n91\n00:04:38.997 --> 00:04:42.757\nI'm gonna go ahead and\npaint over these, with the white.\n\n92\n00:04:42.757 --> 00:04:43.788\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n93\n00:04:43.788 --> 00:04:45.905\n>> Maybe not the best color choice, right?\n\n94\n00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:46.630\n[LAUGH]\n>> No, but\n\n95\n00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.390\nit kind of looks like\nthe eraser we learned about.\n\n96\n00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.820\nBut the difference between the eraser and\nthe brush is that the eraser\n\n97\n00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.708\nwould have removed the pixels whereas this\nbrush just added additional white pixels.\n\n98\n00:04:57.708 --> 00:04:59.440\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n99\n00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.949\n>> Okay.\n\n100\n00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.369\nAnd then the shortcut for\n\n101\n00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:03.660\nswitching your color back and\nforth that is x.\n\n102\n00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.600\nSo if you were to hit x a few times\nyou'll notice in the bottom corner that\n\n103\n00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.860\nwe're flipping back and\nforth between the colors.\n\n104\n00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.910\n>> Hm, very good.\n\n105\n00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:12.610\n>> Okay.\n\n106\n00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.680\nSo let's say that we wanted\nsomething other than red?\n\n107\n00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.220\nLet's go ahead and\nclick on our foreground color.\n\n108\n00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.210\nYou'll notice that we have this whole\ncolor spectrum right here to the right.\n\n109\n00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.810\nLet's say that I wanted a nice blue.\n\n110\n00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.810\nYou'll notice that we don't\nhave any blue right here.\n\n111\n00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.980\nSo what we have to do is we have to\nadjust our part of the color spectrum.\n\n112\n00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.090\nSo you can do that by\ndragging your arrows, or\n\n113\n00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.900\nby simply just clicking on the part\nof the spectrum that you'd like.\n\n114\n00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.430\n>> Very Cool.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n115\n00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.870\nSo you'll notice that\nthe brighter colors and\n\n116\n00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.000\nthe lighter colors are up at the top,\nthe farther you go down in here,\n\n117\n00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.285\nyou're getting darker and\ndarker because they're mixing with black.\n\n118\n00:05:49.285 --> 00:05:50.700\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n119\n00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.130\n>> So\nit's our tints versus our shades here.\n\n120\n00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.650\nSo I'm gonna pick this kind of middle\nof the road purple to demonstrate and\n\n121\n00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.629\nthen I'm going to change our background\ncolor by clicking on the white box.\n\n122\n00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.260\nAnd I'll go ahead and pick a nice green\nbecause they're complimentary colors,\n\n123\n00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.340\nbut you'll notice I'm still\npainting with purple.\n\n124\n00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.240\nWhy is that?\n\n125\n00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.430\nWhat did I do wrong?\n\n126\n00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.030\n>> I'm assuming maybe, cuz your brush\nonly uses the foreground color.\n\n127\n00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.730\nThat's correct.\n\n128\n00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.110\nSo we need to switch it\nto the background color.\n\n129\n00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.460\nSo you can hit the arrow keys and\n\n130\n00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.390\ndraw with green, or you can click\nyour x to switch between the colors.\n\n131\n00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.150\n>> Nice.\n\n132\n00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.640\nSo really you got foreground and\nbackground colors over there, but\n\n133\n00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.800\nyou can almost use them as a way just\nto load up two different colors, and\n\n134\n00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.190\nswitch back and\nforth between them on your brush?\n\n135\n00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.250\n>> Exactly.\n>> Very cool.\n\n136\n00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.340\n>> Yeah.\n\n137\n00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.060\nOkay, so\n\n138\n00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.830\nnow we're going to talk about this cool\nconcept called the eyedropper tool.\n\n139\n00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.480\nSo I'm just going to\nclear out this canvas,\n\n140\n00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.360\nI don't really want it there anymore.\n\n141\n00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.220\nSo I'm gonna to to my layers panel,\nunlock my background, create a new layer.\n\n142\n00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:00.360\nAnd I'm just going to\nfill it with this white,\n\n143\n00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.240\nso remember white's my\nbackground right now.\n\n144\n00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.540\nI need to flip them.\n\n145\n00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.003\nI'm hitting the X and clicking.\n\n146\n00:07:06.003 --> 00:07:08.500\n>> Nice.\n>> Okay, so that was instead of erasing.\n\n147\n00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.650\nSkipped a step,\nI don't need all those doodles anymore.\n\n148\n00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.960\nSo now we're going to use something\ncalled the Eyedropper tool.\n\n149\n00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.430\nReally cool tool, super useful.\n\n150\n00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.260\nBut we need a picture first.\n\n151\n00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.210\nSo let's go ahead and place an image.\n\n152\n00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.760\nSo I'm gonna go to file,\nplace embedded, and\n\n153\n00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.230\nlet's go ahead and do the sunset.jpg\npicture that you have access to.\n\n154\n00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:35.670\nSo I'm gonna place this picture and\nI'm just gonna go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n155\n00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.240\nI'll zoom in a little bit so\nyou can see this photo better.\n\n156\n00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.510\nSo we have this very pretty\nsunset over a river.\n\n157\n00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.870\nLet's say that I really like\nthe color of the sunset and I wanna\n\n158\n00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.850\nuse some of these colors for something\nmaybe like text or adding shapes.\n\n159\n00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.810\nYou can do that with the eyedropper tool.\n\n160\n00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.810\nThere are several ways to\naccess the eyedropper tool.\n\n161\n00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.533\nIt is a tool in your panel.\n\n162\n00:07:56.533 --> 00:07:59.175\nIf you click on it right here,\nit looks like an eyedropper.\n\n163\n00:07:59.175 --> 00:08:01.560\nIf you hover over it,\nit will also say eyedropper.\n\n164\n00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.100\nGo ahead and single click.\n\n165\n00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.627\nClick on your background and\nnow you'll notice my foreground color has\n\n166\n00:08:08.627 --> 00:08:11.430\nchanged to this kind\nof grayish blue color.\n\n167\n00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.510\nNow if I were to click around in here,\nlet's say this nice deeper orange,\n\n168\n00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.700\nyou'll see that.\n\n169\n00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:24.010\nSo every time I click, you'll notice that\nmy foreground color is changing, okay?\n\n170\n00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.140\nThat's one way to access\nthe eye dropper tool.\n\n171\n00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.620\nThe other way to access that\ntool is by clicking on the eye.\n\n172\n00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.745\nSo, eye for eye dropper.\n\n173\n00:08:30.745 --> 00:08:35.500\n[LAUGH] The other way to access it,\nwhich is probably my go to way,\n\n174\n00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.500\njust because I tend to have my color\nbox open, is, if this box is open,\n\n175\n00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.990\nit automatically gives you\naccess to your eye dropper tool.\n\n176\n00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.030\n>> Nice.\n\n177\n00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.780\nOkay, so let's say that I wanted\nto save one of these colors.\n\n178\n00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.030\nSo I really like this kind of mauve color.\n\n179\n00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.950\nI want to save it to my color libraries.\n\n180\n00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:54.830\nYou can do that.\n\n181\n00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.440\nYou can click on this\nadd to swatches button.\n\n182\n00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.540\nSo I'm going to go ahead and do that.\n\n183\n00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.308\nIt'll give you an ability to name it so\nI'm just going to name it mauve.\n\n184\n00:09:03.308 --> 00:09:07.050\nThen clock okay.\n\n185\n00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.540\nI'll cancel out of that now.\n\n186\n00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.930\nSo I've saved a swatch.\n\n187\n00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.340\nBut what is a swatch?\n\n188\n00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.960\nLets go find out.\n\n189\n00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.220\nSo I'm going to collapse\nmy layers panel so\n\n190\n00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.810\nthat way it's not taking up all the space.\n\n191\n00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:22.848\nYou'll notice that I have this\nlittle panel called swatches.\n\n192\n00:09:22.848 --> 00:09:27.820\nIf you don't have this panel, remember\nyou can access it by going to window.\n\n193\n00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.780\nAnd then swatches.\n\n194\n00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.590\nOkay?\nThankfully,\n\n195\n00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.360\nthis menu's in alphabetical order so,\nit's faster to find things.\n\n196\n00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.020\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and click swatches.\n\n197\n00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.770\nNow you'll notice that I have all\nof these little color squares.\n\n198\n00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.610\nThese are just default colors in\nPhotoshop and if you hover over each one\n\n199\n00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:49.160\nwith your eyedropper tool you'll be\nable to see exactly what they're called.\n\n200\n00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.150\nSo pastel blue violet,\nthere's a darker magenta red.\n\n201\n00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.560\nThese colors are pre-loaded.\n\n202\n00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.790\nBut if you remember, I saved my own\ncustom colors so I need to find it.\n\n203\n00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:03.040\nThis works in a very similar way\nto our brush tool where it saves\n\n204\n00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.770\nas your very last color in your panel.\n\n205\n00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:09.665\nSo if I were to hover over this\ncolor you'll see there's my mauve.\n\n206\n00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.260\n>> Very nice.\nI see this, you were saying as a way to,\n\n207\n00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.330\nif you got a color that you like and you\nwant to use it on another document, very\n\n208\n00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.180\neasy to do by grabbing that color with the\neye dropper, saving it in your swatches\n\n209\n00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.740\nas well as if you're editing and you\nreally need to match that color exactly.\n\n210\n00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.900\nWorking on a logo or something like that,\nguess that what the numbers are, right?\n\n211\n00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.330\nJust use your eyedropper tool,\nget the exact color, very cool.\n\n212\n00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.260\n>> Definitely, the other handy thing that\nyou can do so you don't have to place this\n\n213\n00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:42.010\nphoto every time, is you can actually\nsave your color library in Photoshop.\n\n214\n00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:46.000\nSo the way that you do that is you go\nup to this three line hamburger menu.\n\n215\n00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.720\nAnd you'll notice that it says,\nsave swatches.\n\n216\n00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:54.780\nSo if you click save swatches, you'll be\nable to save them as whatever you want.\n\n217\n00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.750\nOkay?\nGo ahead and hit save.\n\n218\n00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.950\nIt'll probably save under optimized color,\nor\n\n219\n00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.940\nsome other folder that\nPhotoshop already has built in.\n\n220\n00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.250\nSo if you're having trouble finding\nyour swatches, they're there somewhere.\n\n221\n00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.095\nYou just have to dig through your\nPhotoshop folder to find them.\n\n222\n00:11:09.095 --> 00:11:11.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So,\n\n223\n00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.580\nas you remember from when\nwe went over brushes,\n\n224\n00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.550\nthere are several other options when\nyou have a flyout menu like this.\n\n225\n00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:21.690\nYou can also reset your swatches which\nwould reset them to the default colors.\n\n226\n00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:25.340\nYou can load swatches that maybe you've\ndownloaded from somewhere else or saved.\n\n227\n00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.600\nYou can save your swatches,\nyou can replace the swatches, or\n\n228\n00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:35.550\nyou'll notice that we have all of\nthese different listed color here.\n\n229\n00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.720\nSo if we specifically wanted paint\nPantone colors you could do that,\n\n230\n00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.040\nyou could pick Pantone solid coated.\n\n231\n00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.830\nAnd you'll notice that we have\nthis same little box that pops up.\n\n232\n00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.898\nJust like we had with our brushes,\nwhere you can click OK or Append.\n\n233\n00:11:49.898 --> 00:11:53.370\nSo remember append is if you just\nwant to add them to the bottom\n\n234\n00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.230\nof your color panel.\n\n235\n00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.300\nOkay would be replacing all the colors\nthat are already in here with these\n\n236\n00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.260\nspecific Pantone colors.\n\n237\n00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.440\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick append, and\n\n238\n00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.176\nnow I have all these extra colors\ndown here that are my Pantone colors.\n\n239\n00:12:07.176 --> 00:12:08.760\n>> Very easy.\n\n240\n00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.560\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n241\n00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.850\nYep, quick, simple and to the point.\n\n242\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.380\nAll right, so there's another thing\nI wanna show you with how to get\n\n243\n00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.190\nthe specific color, like you mentioned.\n\n244\n00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:20.320\nSo if you're doing something like a logo,\nand you need that specific brand color,\n\n245\n00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.500\nthere's a way to input\nthat into Photoshop.\n\n246\n00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.030\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nopen up my little foreground color here.\n\n247\n00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:31.540\nYou could also access this by\nclicking on color as well, but\n\n248\n00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.980\nI like to access it from the foreground\nbackground just to have it in mind.\n\n249\n00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.570\nIt's completely up to you,\nwhatever you wanna do.\n\n250\n00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.650\nYou'll notice that we have\nall these letters down here\n\n251\n00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:42.230\nin this bottom right corner.\n\n252\n00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.100\nSo these letters stand for things.\n\n253\n00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:50.160\nChances are the two that you're gonna\nbe using the most are RGB and CMYK.\n\n254\n00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.440\nSo RGB, that's the color process for\ndigital screens.\n\n255\n00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.410\nSo if you're designing for web.\n\n256\n00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.570\n>> This is what you're\ngonna want your RGB colors.\n\n257\n00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:00.700\nIf you're designing for print,\nyou're going to want your CMYK.\n\n258\n00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.730\nYour CMYK stands for Cyan,\nMagenta, Yellow, and Black.\n\n259\n00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.310\nSo you'll notice that I have\nnumbers in here already.\n\n260\n00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:14.290\nThe reason why is because Photoshop\nknows these specific color combinations,\n\n261\n00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:19.040\nthese formulas, these codes that\noutput a very specific color.\n\n262\n00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.900\nSo let's see what would happen\nif we changed our R to 20%.\n\n263\n00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:28.280\nYou'll notice now we're in a completely\ndifferent part of the color spectrum.\n\n264\n00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:33.800\nThe reason why is cuz we're mixing\ndifferent amounts of these hues together.\n\n265\n00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.289\nSo let's change that for\ngreen as well to see what happens.\n\n266\n00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:38.800\nAnd for black.\n\n267\n00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.480\nNow we have this really dark green color.\n\n268\n00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.380\nYeah, the other that you\nmight have is a hex code.\n\n269\n00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:50.480\nSo a hex code is at the very\nbottom of your screen.\n\n270\n00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.180\nIt's the hashtag or a pound symbol.\n\n271\n00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.280\nAnd then a six-digit code.\n\n272\n00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.210\nSo hex, six.\n\n273\n00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:57.800\n>> Easy to remember.\n\n274\n00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.700\nHex codes are something that\nyou use in web design, so\n\n275\n00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:06.190\nif you are designing a custom website for\nsomebody and you really need a specific\n\n276\n00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:11.090\ncolor of purple or pink,\nthis is where you would input that number.\n\n277\n00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.400\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n278\n00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.849\njust give you an example with\njust F to show you what happens.\n\n279\n00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:26.750\nSo, I embedded six f's, so f, f, f, f, f,\nthat is white in any kind of color world.\n\n280\n00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:28.210\nSo, that's white.\n\n281\n00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.220\nSo, full brightness.\n\n282\n00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.150\nNow, if you had a very specific color\nin mind, you could change that out.\n\n283\n00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.000\nSo, it could be f two, four, five, f.\n\n284\n00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:39.640\nThere you go.\n\n285\n00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.380\nThat's a dark blue.\n\n286\n00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.420\nNow if you're doing something for\nweb design,\n\n287\n00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.210\nyou're trying to figure out what the hex\ncode is for a color, what you could do\n\n288\n00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:51.450\nis take a picture of whatever that\nimage is and put it into Photoshop and\n\n289\n00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.810\nthen your Eyedropper tool to\nfigure out that exact color.\n\n290\n00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:55.660\n>> Very nice.\n\n291\n00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:56.689\n>> Yeah, so it works both ways.\n\n292\n00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.218\nAll right, lots of ways we\ncan pick the color we want.\n\n293\n00:15:01.218 --> 00:15:03.320\n[LAUGH]\n>> Definitely, definitely.\n\n294\n00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.430\nSo now we're going to kinda switch\ngears and talk about color fills.\n\n295\n00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:11.070\nSo I'm going to hide this image\nsince we don't need it anymore,\n\n296\n00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.200\nand we're gonna talk about\nthe concept of a color fill.\n\n297\n00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.180\nSo fill is where you are to fill\nin an area with another color.\n\n298\n00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.710\nSo you can fill a background,\n\n299\n00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:24.500\nso instead of clicking on\nthe paint bucket tool to do it.\n\n300\n00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.770\nYou could do it a different way.\n\n301\n00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:29.510\nSo I'm going to demonstrate that for\nyou right now.\n\n302\n00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.920\nSo I'm going to create a new layer.\n\n303\n00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.910\nAnd we're going to use\none of our marquee tools,\n\n304\n00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.275\none that we learned\nlearned a while back now.\n\n305\n00:15:36.275 --> 00:15:40.035\nI'm going to use the elliptical\nmarquee tool to draw out a circle.\n\n306\n00:15:40.035 --> 00:15:41.845\nSo go ahead and\nselect your elliptical marquee.\n\n307\n00:15:41.845 --> 00:15:44.545\nIt may be hidden under your\nrectangular marquee tool.\n\n308\n00:15:44.545 --> 00:15:46.175\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n309\n00:15:46.175 --> 00:15:49.900\nIf you don't see it right away,\nclick on your flyout menu.\n\n310\n00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:55.427\nNow I'm going to click, hold shift,\nand drag out to get my perfect circle.\n\n311\n00:15:55.427 --> 00:15:59.043\nSo now I have these dotted lines,\nmy little ants are running around.\n\n312\n00:15:59.043 --> 00:16:01.241\n[LAUGH]\n>> I have an empty selection because\n\n313\n00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:05.430\nthere's really nothing there, but what if\nI wanted to fill this circle with a color.\n\n314\n00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.990\nI could, so I'm gonna go up to Edit.\n\n315\n00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:10.580\nAnd then I'm going to go to fill.\n\n316\n00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:14.240\nAnd then you'll notice it\ngives you all these options.\n\n317\n00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.680\nYou can fill a foreground color,\na background color, another color.\n\n318\n00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.140\nAll sorts of different options so\nI'm just going to do,\n\n319\n00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.630\nlet's do the foreground color which\nis that kind of grayish color.\n\n320\n00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.080\nNow click OK.\n\n321\n00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.040\nAnd now we have a circle\nfilled with color.\n\n322\n00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.940\n>> Very neat.\n\n323\n00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.230\n>> Let's say that we wanted something\na little more custom than that\n\n324\n00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:36.520\n>> What can you do is use one of your\n\n325\n00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.610\nlasso tools.\n\n326\n00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:38.970\nSo we have learned about the lasso tool.\n\n327\n00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:42.410\nNow we're going to use it for something\nthat's more than just a selection.\n\n328\n00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:46.010\nWe're actually going to use it in\na similar way to the pen tool.\n\n329\n00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.680\nSo I'm going to draw out a shape,\nI'm just going to draw out a little heart.\n\n330\n00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.250\nAnd now I have my running ants again.\n\n331\n00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:59.810\nAnd lets go ahead and\ngo to edit, fill, and\n\n332\n00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.800\nthis time we're going to fill\nit with a background color.\n\n333\n00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.660\nThen, click OK.\n\n334\n00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:10.480\nNow this really isn't ideal because\nI have them on the same layer so\n\n335\n00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.420\nif I wanted to move one apart from the\nother, I would have to select them again.\n\n336\n00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.239\nSo keep that in mind when you're\ndoing anything with your layers.\n\n337\n00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.190\nOkay.\nSo that's what a fill is.\n\n338\n00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.480\nA fill is just simply\nfilling something with color.\n\n339\n00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.090\n>> Nice.\n>> Okay.\n\n340\n00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:28.280\nSo now, we're going to talk about\nsomething called color proofing.\n\n341\n00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.700\nSo this is what you would do to check\n\n342\n00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:34.620\nto see how your image looks\nbefore you send it to a printer.\n\n343\n00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:39.060\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nbring up my sunset picture again.\n\n344\n00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.840\nSo I just turned on the visibility, turned\noff the visibility of my fill layers.\n\n345\n00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:49.490\nAnd this time we're going to go\nup to View and Proof Colors.\n\n346\n00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:52.980\nSo what this does is it'll show you\nwhat it will look like when it goes to\n\n347\n00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.140\na printer.\n\n348\n00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.460\nNow you can be more specific\nby going to Proof Setup,\n\n349\n00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.010\nand you'll notice that we have.\n\n350\n00:17:59.010 --> 00:17:59.840\nWorking CMYK,\n\n351\n00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:04.540\nyou can look at it by plate, which is\nsomething that a printer might do.\n\n352\n00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:10.340\nYou can also look for monitor RGB, so\nagain, RGB is your digital screens.\n\n353\n00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.280\nAnd then my favorite thing is,\n\n354\n00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.300\nyou can look to see what these\ncolors would look like to somebody\n\n355\n00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.899\nthat had a type of colorblindness,\nso let's go ahead and try that out.\n\n356\n00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:24.790\nYou'll notice now we're seeing the picture\nfrom somebody who is color blind,\n\n357\n00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.170\nthey're eyesight.\n\n358\n00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.560\n>> Interesting.\n>> So it's a great way to test designs so\n\n359\n00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:32.690\nthat you know whether your color scheme\nworks for somebody with color blindness.\n\n360\n00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:35.430\n>> Absolutely and we're always\ntrying to design your web pages for\n\n361\n00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:36.750\naccessibility and things like that.\n\n362\n00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:39.050\nA very cool tool built right\ninto Photoshop for that.\n\n363\n00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.950\nYes, Photoshop is really handy and\n\n364\n00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:45.150\nthey definitely think with\naccessibility in mind.\n\n365\n00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.420\nSo I'm going to go back to view,\nproof set up, and\n\n366\n00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.210\nI'll just go back to my working CNY case,\nso we can see it just as we did before.\n\n367\n00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.280\nOkay, so\n\n368\n00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:00.280\nnow we need to talk about choosing color\nschemes and how you might do that.\n\n369\n00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.740\nSo let's say you're not really sure\nwhat you want your color scheme to be.\n\n370\n00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.160\nYou don't have a picture\nto base it off of.\n\n371\n00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:11.660\nThere's this great tool that Adobe offers\ncalled Adobe Color CC or Adobe Kuler.\n\n372\n00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:12.310\nIt's a website.\n\n373\n00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.060\nYou can go on there.\n\n374\n00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.850\nYou can pick your complementary colors,\n\n375\n00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.680\nanalogous colors,\nmonochromatic color schemes.\n\n376\n00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.592\nSo if you're ever stuck and\nyou're thinking.\n\n377\n00:19:19.592 --> 00:19:21.510\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> What in the world do I do for color?\n\n378\n00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:23.185\nAdobe has you covered.\n\n379\n00:19:23.185 --> 00:19:26.310\n[LAUGH]\n>> You know it seems like a simple thing,\n\n380\n00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:30.470\nbut I've spent many hours trying to figure\nout what the best color combination was.\n\n381\n00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:33.520\nIt's great to have access\nto a tool that can\n\n382\n00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.880\nshow you what kind of colors go well\ntogether, what are gonna work together.\n\n383\n00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.050\nNice.\n>> Exactly, exactly, exactly.\n\n384\n00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:43.790\nAll right so I'm going to show you a\nreally cool way to just grab a quick color\n\n385\n00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:44.970\nscheme from an image itself.\n\n386\n00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:46.360\nSo I'm going to open up an image.\n\n387\n00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:53.310\nLet's go to file and let's go to open and\nI'm going to open up our lighthouse image.\n\n388\n00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.100\nOkay so find that in your files.\n\n389\n00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.220\nGo to Open, and\nnow we have this great lighthouse.\n\n390\n00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.070\nNow if I wanted that\nparticular shade of blue,\n\n391\n00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:06.340\nI could of course use my Eyedropper tool,\nfigure out what it is.\n\n392\n00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.930\nBut there's a little\ncheater's way to do it.\n\n393\n00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:13.570\nSo what we're gonna do is we are going to\ntreat this as if it were a GIF or a GIF.\n\n394\n00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:19.930\nAnd we're gonna go up to our File menu And\nthen we are going to find Save for Web.\n\n395\n00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:24.090\nSo depending on what version of Photoshop\nyou have, Save for Web might be listed\n\n396\n00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:28.070\nabout right here, if it's not it's\nnow hidden under the export menu.\n\n397\n00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.340\nSo go to Export > Save for Web.\n\n398\n00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.950\nAnd what I'm going to do is I'm going to\nmake sure that GIF or GIF is selected.\n\n399\n00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.170\nAnd now it defaults to 256 so\n\n400\n00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:43.670\nyours is going to have the 256 colors\nthat primarily make up this image, but\n\n401\n00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:47.640\nI don't want 256 colors,\nthat's a really large color scheme.\n\n402\n00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:52.420\nSo I'm going to adjust that down so\nI'm going to say maybe eight colors.\n\n403\n00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.820\nAnd you'll notice if you look at our color\ntable now I have the eight colors here.\n\n404\n00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.010\nLet's zoom out so\nyou can see what it did to my image.\n\n405\n00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:05.010\nSo now, it's recreated this image\njust using these eight colors.\n\n406\n00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.000\nBut these are the eight colors that\nare the most prominent in this\n\n407\n00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.550\nlighthouse image.\n\n408\n00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:12.740\nSo if I wanted to save\nthis color table I could.\n\n409\n00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:17.660\nYou would click on this little menu, and\nyou're going to do Save Color Table.\n\n410\n00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.090\nYou can save it as whatever\nyou want it to be.\n\n411\n00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:24.130\nClick Save and\nthen this is another way for\n\n412\n00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.378\nyou to load colors from\nyour Swatches panel.\n\n413\n00:21:26.378 --> 00:21:27.318\n>> Very cool.\n\n414\n00:21:27.318 --> 00:21:30.515\n>> Mm-hm, so a quick,\nsimple, easy little trick.\n\n415\n00:21:30.515 --> 00:21:32.410\n>> Mm-hm, I like it.\n\n416\n00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:33.260\n>> Okay.\n\n417\n00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:36.300\nSo now that we've learned\nall about just solid colors,\n\n418\n00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.610\nwe're going to learn about gradients.\n\n419\n00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.430\nThis is a really fun concept.\n\n420\n00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:45.670\nLet's go ahead and just create\na new blank document for gradients.\n\n421\n00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:50.480\nI'm gonna go to file, new, and\nthis time I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n422\n00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.370\ndo a 6x4 just cuz it's\nless ground to cover.\n\n423\n00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:57.010\nSo you can change your width to six\ninches, your height for 4 inches.\n\n424\n00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.520\nClick OK, and\nnow we have a blank canvas again.\n\n425\n00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.210\nSo you need to talk about this pesky\ngradient tool, and what it does,\n\n426\n00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.330\nwhat it means, so let's find it first.\n\n427\n00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:10.170\nSo the gradient tool is hidden\nbeneath the paint bucket tool.\n\n428\n00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:13.740\nIt's that little box that fades to light.\n\n429\n00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:14.860\nOkay.\n\n430\n00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.050\nI'm going to go ahead and\nreset my default colors.\n\n431\n00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.790\nSo you can click D or you can click on\nour little icon down in the bottom left.\n\n432\n00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.450\nSo now that we're at our default colors,\nand\n\n433\n00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:28.590\nyou'll notice that our gradient has\ndefaulted as well to that very first\n\n434\n00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:31.450\ngradient in the list which\nis a linear gradient.\n\n435\n00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:36.990\nNow, I'm just going to click,\ndrag and let go.\n\n436\n00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:38.000\nAnd now we have a gradient.\n\n437\n00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.860\nSo a gradient is a fading color effect.\n\n438\n00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.640\nThey're very customizable,\nyou can do whatever you want with them.\n\n439\n00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.660\nThey look totally different depending\non where you click, how far you drag so\n\n440\n00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.785\nlet's text that out.\n\n441\n00:22:49.785 --> 00:22:51.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm going to undo that.\n\n442\n00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.090\nLet's say I started at the middle and\nturned all the way down straight.\n\n443\n00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:58.260\nIf I wanted my line to be straight,\nI can click Shift.\n\n444\n00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:03.440\nLet it go, there you go, if I redo it\nfrom the bottom, totally different.\n\n445\n00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.090\nSo you'll notice just depending on\nwhere you're clicking and hold and\n\n446\n00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:10.160\ndrag, your gradient's going to\nbe more severe, less severe and\n\n447\n00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.130\nmore of a fading effect,\nso that's what it is.\n\n448\n00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.880\nBut this gradient is based\noff of our default color.\n\n449\n00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.930\nSo if I were to change my color from\nblack and white, to maybe red and\n\n450\n00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:25.950\ngreen, then you would see the same loo,\nk but the hues would be different.\n\n451\n00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.580\nLet's try a different gradient.\n\n452\n00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:33.310\nSo, to the right of my little gradient\nbox, you'll see a different option.\n\n453\n00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.530\nSo we're going to try\na radial gradient now.\n\n454\n00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:38.290\nOkay, so this one is a circle.\n\n455\n00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:41.690\nSo same thing, it just totally depends\non where you're clicking, holding,\n\n456\n00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:42.860\nand dragging.\n\n457\n00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:47.520\n>> Now seems to be,\nstarting with where you're clicking is\n\n458\n00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.550\nyour foreground color, where you're\nletting to is your background color.\n\n459\n00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.050\nSo the grading goes from there?\n\n460\n00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:53.830\n>> Right.\n>> Very cool.\n\n461\n00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:54.745\n>> Right!\n\n462\n00:23:54.745 --> 00:23:59.792\nAnd you'll notice just each one\nhas a totally different look.\n\n463\n00:23:59.792 --> 00:24:03.703\nGradients are great because they ehlp\nyou to make something to look even\n\n464\n00:24:03.703 --> 00:24:04.681\nmore realistic,\n\n465\n00:24:04.681 --> 00:24:09.560\na lot of time on websites the buttons\nhave a very slight gradient to them.\n\n466\n00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.270\nOr if you're doing some\nkind of metallic design,\n\n467\n00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.230\nit's also good to know\nhow to make a gradient.\n\n468\n00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.455\n>> Almost gives you a little\ndepth perception, and\n\n469\n00:24:17.455 --> 00:24:21.225\nsometimes a flat color just looks so,\nI don't know, fake.\n\n470\n00:24:21.225 --> 00:24:25.005\nI don't wanna say fake, but\nif there's a technical term for\n\n471\n00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:27.725\nthat, yeah, but without the gradient,\nit's just so plain.\n\n472\n00:24:27.725 --> 00:24:32.025\n>> It is very plain,\nflat designs are pretty popular,\n\n473\n00:24:32.025 --> 00:24:34.965\non the rise, but flat designs\nlook a lot better in illustrator,\n\n474\n00:24:34.965 --> 00:24:37.645\ncuz you're working with more\nof that cartoon back dropping.\n\n475\n00:24:37.645 --> 00:24:38.392\n>> Right, right.\n\n476\n00:24:38.392 --> 00:24:39.710\nAll right, so\nI'm going to click hold and drag,\n\n477\n00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:41.830\nso that's just the basis of a gradient.\n\n478\n00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.620\nSo like I said, if we were to change our\ncolors, it would look totally different,\n\n479\n00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.210\nso let's try that out.\n\n480\n00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:53.130\ni'm going to change my foreground\ncolor to a light blue, and now\n\n481\n00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:57.320\nI'm going to click on my x, so that way\nit brings my background to my foreground.\n\n482\n00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.060\nAnd I'm going to choose a dark blue for\nthis.\n\n483\n00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.080\nI'm gonna click X again so\nthey're in different spots.\n\n484\n00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:07.880\nNow if I were to click, hold, and\ndrag, now our colors are blue.\n\n485\n00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.815\nSo now we have this nice\nlittle ocean environment.\n\n486\n00:25:09.815 --> 00:25:11.180\n[LAUGH] All right,\n\n487\n00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.510\nlet's say that you wanted to\ncustomize this gradient even further.\n\n488\n00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:18.920\nWhat you could do is click on\nthis fading gradient box and\n\n489\n00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.270\nhere's our Gradient Editor.\n\n490\n00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:24.110\nSo you'll notice all of our different\npresets that are preloaded.\n\n491\n00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:27.500\nYou an also change out your colors and\nwhere they stop.\n\n492\n00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.540\nSo if you were to drag these\nlittle boxes along the bottom,\n\n493\n00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.650\nit totally customizes your gradient.\n\n494\n00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.490\nSo let's go ahead and click.\n\n495\n00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:38.460\nAnd you'll notice that\nmy color is right here.\n\n496\n00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.150\nI can change my color by\nclicking on the little color box.\n\n497\n00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:46.815\nAnd let's change it to a green, so\nyou'll definitely see the difference.\n\n498\n00:25:46.815 --> 00:25:48.250\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you can come in here and\n\n499\n00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:52.470\ncompletely customize what your gradient\nlooks like, and really control it.\n\n500\n00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:53.970\nYou can also add how smooth it is.\n\n501\n00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:54.470\nHow.\n\n502\n00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.180\nOpaque it is, all that right here.\n\n503\n00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.110\nSo you can also save gradient and\nuse them later if you'd like.\n\n504\n00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:05.600\nOr you can load a gradient and\nsave from other places.\n\n505\n00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.170\nThe other thing you can do is\nclick on this little gear icon.\n\n506\n00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.600\nIt's kind of small and\n\n507\n00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.370\nyou'll notice there are some other\npre built gradients in Photoshop.\n\n508\n00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:17.910\nIf I were to click on metal for instance.\n\n509\n00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:19.440\nWe're gonna get that same appender okay?\n\n510\n00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:24.650\nI'm gonna click append and now we\nhave a few extra choices for metals.\n\n511\n00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:29.900\nSo, I just drag this out and\nnow we have a cool metallic gradient.\n\n512\n00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:30.491\n>> Nice.\n\n513\n00:26:30.491 --> 00:26:31.161\nNice.\n\n514\n00:26:31.161 --> 00:26:31.831\n>> Okay.\n\n515\n00:26:31.831 --> 00:26:32.950\n>> Very cool.\n\n516\n00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:36.880\nI tell you what Kera a lot of information\ndealing with colors how to pick them out.\n\n517\n00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.170\nHow to get them loaded up in\nthe appropriate tool that we wanna use.\n\n518\n00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.390\nAnd I know we've got More to talk\nabout when it comes to colors,\n\n519\n00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:46.170\nbut unfortunately we're out of time for\nthis particular episode, so\n\n520\n00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:47.080\nwe're gonna have to call it there.\n\n521\n00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.520\nBut, we'll be back with more color.\n\n522\n00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.300\nSo I hope everybody enjoyed watching.\n\n523\n00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.760\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n524\n00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.400\n>> And I'm Carrie Pane.\n\n525\n00:26:54.400 -->

00:00:20.249\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, today\nwe're doing a Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.965\nSpecifically in this episode it's time for\nanother one of those try\n\n5\n00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:28.480\nit out exercises and we're gonna do a mood\nboard or working with choosing colors.\n\n6\n00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.560\nSo get ready and let's get started.\n\n7\n00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.669\nWe'll dive in with Miss Kara Page.\n\n8\n00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.080\nAll right let's go ahead and get started.\n\n9\n00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.940\nSo, open up Photoshop,\nand have it ready to go.\n\n10\n00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.450\nSo I'll just give you a second.\n\n11\n00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.510\nOkay, hopefully you're good.\n\n12\n00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.490\nIf not, you can just pause me,\nyou can pause me anytime.\n\n13\n00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.550\n[LAUGH] We're going to\nopen a file this time.\n\n14\n00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.040\nSo, let's go to File > Open.\n\n15\n00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.724\nAnd, we are going to\nfind wildflowers.jpeg.\n\n16\n00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.210\nLet's go ahead and click OK.\n\n17\n00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.860\nSo we have this lovely photo of\nwild flowers in Colorado and\n\n18\n00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.180\nwe want to make our colors\nbased off of this image.\n\n19\n00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.390\nSo we're going to be making some\nthing that's called a mood board.\n\n20\n00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.320\nSo typically a mood board has a whole\nbunch of different pictures added together\n\n21\n00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.720\nto really capture the essence of you,\nor a brand, or whatever it is.\n\n22\n00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.430\nBut we're just gonna do a single\npicture mood board just so\n\n23\n00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.780\nyou can see what that would like.\n\n24\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.230\nSo let's go ahead and dive right in.\n\n25\n00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.120\nFirst things we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna create a new layer,\n\n26\n00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.350\ncuz we don't really wanna do anything\ndisruptive to our wild flowers.\n\n27\n00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.560\nSo I'm gonna click on New, and\nI'm going to create a color fill.\n\n28\n00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.860\nSo we just learned how to do that.\n\n29\n00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.980\nI'm going to select my rectangular marquee\ntool, so again it's probably hidden under\n\n30\n00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.770\nyour elliptical if you're following\nalong with the last lesson.\n\n31\n00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.470\nI'm going to click+hold and\ndrag out to about here, and let go.\n\n32\n00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.226\nSo now I want to fill it with white,\nbut if I were to click Edit > Fill Now,\n\n33\n00:02:02.226 --> 00:02:06.640\nit would be this top blue, so we need to\nchange it back to our default colors.\n\n34\n00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.600\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and click d for\n\n35\n00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.160\nthat, to change it back to default, but\nblack is on top, cuz that is the default,\n\n36\n00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.580\nso let's go ahead and\nclick x to switch it to be white on top.\n\n37\n00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.780\nSo again, playing with shortcuts,\nit's a lot faster than clicking around.\n\n38\n00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.360\nSo let's go up to Edit, and\nwe going to go to Fill.\n\n39\n00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.100\nAnd I want it to be my foreground color,\nso\n\n40\n00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.240\nmake sure you have the selected and\nclick OK.\n\n41\n00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.220\nSo now we have this nice little white\nblank spot for us to put our colors.\n\n42\n00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.430\nI'm going to deselect this box and\nI'm going to just rename this box so\n\n43\n00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.460\nI know what it is.\n\n44\n00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.190\nRemember, it's always a good\nidea to rename your layers so\n\n45\n00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.750\nthat way if you have a document that has\n50 layers, they're not all just layer 1,\n\n46\n00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.150\nlayer 22, layer 25,\nthat would be extremely confusing.\n\n47\n00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.750\nSo, remember to rename your layers.\n\n48\n00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.746\nAnd if you forgot how to rename them\nagain you just double-click on the name,\n\n49\n00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:02.710\ntype in the name, hit Enter,\nyou're good to go.\n\n50\n00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.590\nSo now we have a place to put our colors,\nnow we need to find our colors.\n\n51\n00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.500\nSo I'm going to click on the eye which\nbrings up our eye dropper tool, or\n\n52\n00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.709\nyou can click on the tool itself.\n\n53\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.440\nI am going to first select a nice violet.\n\n54\n00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.470\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm going\nfind a flower that I really like,\n\n55\n00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.720\nI personally like this one right here.\n\n56\n00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.600\nAnd I'm gonna single-click, and now\nyou'll notice that we have this violet.\n\n57\n00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.760\nI'm gonna click on it, but\nI wanna add this to my swatches.\n\n58\n00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.660\nSo I'm gonna click Add Swatches,\nand I'm gonna name it Violet.\n\n59\n00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.550\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm\ngonna use the brush tool, and\n\n60\n00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.010\nI'm going to create\na series of color dots so\n\n61\n00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.130\nthat way we can clearly see this\ncolor scheme on our screen.\n\n62\n00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.250\nSo to get to the brush tool,\nyou can either click on it, or\n\n63\n00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.520\nyou can hit the letter b for brush.\n\n64\n00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.300\nI'm gonna hit the letter b.\n\n65\n00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.270\nI'm going to make my\nbrush quite a bit bigger.\n\n66\n00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.150\nAgain you can change it up here at size,\nor you can just hit your right or\n\n67\n00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.500\nleft brackets.\n\n68\n00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.200\nSo this is still a little bit small for\nmy area, so\n\n69\n00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.380\nI'm gonna hit my brackets a few times.\n\n70\n00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.740\nNow I have a nice 300 size brush but\nyou can use whatever size you'd like.\n\n71\n00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.720\nSo I'm gonna single-click,\nand now I have a dot.\n\n72\n00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.590\nBut, I put it on the same layer as my box,\nwhich is not what I wanna do.\n\n73\n00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.880\nSo I'm gonna undo that,\ncreate a new layer,\n\n74\n00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.720\nname it Violet and\nthen I'm going to single-click again.\n\n75\n00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.350\nSo there's our first color,\nit's our violet.\n\n76\n00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.300\nLet's go back and choose another color,\nso I'm gonna click on the eye again.\n\n77\n00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.580\nAnd this time I'm going to pick one\nof these nice deeper purples at\n\n78\n00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.900\nthe bottom here.\n\n79\n00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.440\nSo I'm going to click on that,\ngo ahead and add to swatches and\n\n80\n00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.182\nI'll call it deep purple.\n\n81\n00:04:46.182 --> 00:04:48.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like the band, [LAUGH],\n\n82\n00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.510\nyou're probably too young for\nthat, but that's fine.\n\n83\n00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.555\nI'm going to click OK.\n\n84\n00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.420\nAnd let's create a new layer,\n\n85\n00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.475\ngo back to my brush by hitting b and\nthen try to line it up just so.\n\n86\n00:05:01.475 --> 00:05:03.930\nSingle-click, now we\nhave an additional color.\n\n87\n00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.472\nI'm gonna name this one\ndeep purple over here,\n\n88\n00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:09.290\ncuz remember naming layers saves you.\n\n89\n00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.980\nLet's pick two more colors out of here.\n\n90\n00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.410\nSo I'm going to pick this nice little\nyellow color because he's off by himself.\n\n91\n00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.960\nAnd a green,\ncuz we have a lot of green in this image.\n\n92\n00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.890\nSo I'm gonna click my eye for eyedropper,\nclick on this yellow, create a swatch for\n\n93\n00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.590\nhim, I'm gonna name him sunflower.\n\n94\n00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.050\nEven though it's not a sunflower,\nit's a sunflower yellow to me.\n\n95\n00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:39.265\nSo, new layer, let's rename it sunflower\nand then back to brush by hitting b.\n\n96\n00:05:39.265 --> 00:05:42.490\nLine it up, let go, and\nnow we have an additional color.\n\n97\n00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.700\nSo we are going to do that one more time.\n\n98\n00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.060\nSo I'm going to go back to i,\nby now you should be a pro hopefully.\n\n99\n00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.840\nBack to i,\nI'm going to pick a green leaf down here,\n\n100\n00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.700\ncreate a swatch based on that.\n\n101\n00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.880\nSo I'm gonna call this leaf.\n\n102\n00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.860\nOkay, new layer, let's rename you leaf.\n\n103\n00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.450\nBack to brush, so b, and single-click.\n\n104\n00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.480\nSo now we have this lovely color scheme,\nbut\n\n105\n00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.220\nI want to group all of my color swatches\nthat I just created by making a group,\n\n106\n00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.500\nso this is a refresher on\ncreating layer groups.\n\n107\n00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.060\nI'm going to select this folder icon at\nthe bottom, it changed it to Group One.\n\n108\n00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.075\nAnd I'll rename it by double clicking,\nand I'm going to name this swatches.\n\n109\n00:06:29.075 --> 00:06:31.742\nI'm gonna click on our first color swatch,\n\n110\n00:06:31.742 --> 00:06:37.440\nShift + click on our last color swatch and\ndrag them into my swatches folder.\n\n111\n00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.629\nSo, now I have a really organized file.\n\n112\n00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:44.093\nSo, typically with mood boards,\njust to make it easier on yourself,\n\n113\n00:06:44.093 --> 00:06:47.323\nyou would want to put down the color\ncode for each of these colors,\n\n114\n00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:51.580\nso that way you don't have to keep\nopening it, you can just type in a code.\n\n115\n00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.340\nSo, to do that, let's go ahead and\nclick on our eyedropper tool.\n\n116\n00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.480\nLet's click on our first top violet,\nopen it up, and\n\n117\n00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.550\nthen here's our CMYK,\nRGB, and our hex code.\n\n118\n00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.180\nSo depending on what you're designing for,\n\n119\n00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.900\nyou would put whatever color\ncode corresponds to that.\n\n120\n00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.090\nSo if you're doing web design,\nyou put a hex code.\n\n121\n00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.570\nIf you're doing something intended for\nthe computer, so\n\n122\n00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.350\nmaybe an online banner ad,\nyou would do RGB.\n\n123\n00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.660\nIf you're doing print you would do CMYK.\n\n124\n00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.620\nSo I'm just going to test out the hex code\nso I'm gonna copy this code at the bottom,\n\n125\n00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.420\nI'm gonna to my type tool,\nwhich we haven't learned much about,\n\n126\n00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.120\nthat's completely fine.\n\n127\n00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:35.650\nI'm just gonna single-click then hashtag,\npaste my number.\n\n128\n00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.640\nAnd this is a little bit large,\nit doesn't need to be 300, so\n\n129\n00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.550\nI'm just gonna adjust the size at the top.\n\n130\n00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:46.910\nAnd then scoot it over, hit Enter, and\nthen just click off so you can see.\n\n131\n00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.150\nSo that's what you can do for\n\n132\n00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.330\nevery color, so that way it is\njust a quick reference guide for\n\n133\n00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:56.860\nyou later on, if you wanna just pop back\nin and see what colors you wanted to use.\n\n134\n00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.350\nSo if I wanted to save that color scheme\nfor the future, I could to swatches and\n\n135\n00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:06.055\ndown at the bottom you'll see my swatches,\nI'm gonna go to File\n\n136\n00:08:06.055 --> 00:08:11.170\n> Save Swatches, save them for later,\nso that I have my flowers there.\n\n137\n00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.533\n>> Fantastic, great little way\nto create that mood board,\n\n138\n00:08:14.533 --> 00:08:19.170\nget the colors you wanna use organized\nin spot, thanks for that, lots of fun.\n\n139\n00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:20.620\nHope you guys enjoyed that.\n\n140\n00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.022\nTry it out, look forward to doing some\nmore with Miss Kara Page, but for\n\n141\n00:08:24.022 --> 00:08:26.610\nnow, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n142\n00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:27.240\n>> And I'm Kara Page.\n\n143\n00:08:27.240 -->

00:00:17.240\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.050\nToday we're doing Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n5\n00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.070\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ncontinuing to take a look at colors.\n\n6\n00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.210\nAnd we're gonna dive into the world\nof really of color adjustment.\n\n7\n00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.760\nRight?\nWe said that color is a pretty\n\n8\n00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.650\ncomplex topic.\n\n9\n00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.400\nWe've talked a lot about the basic\nterminology, hues and saturation.\n\n10\n00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.020\nBut we're not stuck with what we picked.\n\n11\n00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.720\nThere's a lot of different adjustments\nthat we can do and we've brought in our\n\n12\n00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.860\ncolor adjustment expert, Mr.\nNick Page to help us with that.\n\n13\n00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.630\nHow's it going, Nick?\n\n14\n00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.350\n>> Pretty good.\n\n15\n00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.960\nHow you doing?\n\n16\n00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.020\n>> Doing great.\n\n17\n00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.780\n>> All right, so when you think of\nPhotoshop, what do you think of?\n\n18\n00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.230\n>> Like if you ever Photoshop an image,\nwhat does that mean to you?\n\n19\n00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.280\n>> Usually trying to maybe fix some\nthings that maybe I didn't like about\n\n20\n00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.240\nthe picture?\n\n21\n00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.840\n>> Exactly.\nThat is what we're gonna be doing today.\n\n22\n00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.680\nWe will be using colors and\nadjustment layers or\n\n23\n00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.090\nimage adjustments, sorry,\nto manipulate the photography.\n\n24\n00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.435\nSo we'll start with a picture.\n\n25\n00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:14.325\nThat's called beach.jpg.\n\n26\n00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:16.420\nIt's just a nice little beach picture.\n\n27\n00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.060\nIt looks great, but I kinda wanna\nmake it look a little better.\n\n28\n00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.610\n>> Okay.\n>> So\n\n29\n00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.500\nwith this, I'm going to adjust a few,\nlike the brightness possibly.\n\n30\n00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.580\nIt could be underexposed, overexposed, and\n\n31\n00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.890\nthe color could be\nwashed out a little bit.\n\n32\n00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.520\nSo, I kinda wanna fix that.\n\n33\n00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.330\nTo start off we will go up at the top,\nthe image menu.\n\n34\n00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.197\nGo down to adjustments and\nthen you have a bunch of options here.\n\n35\n00:01:41.197 --> 00:01:44.590\nWow.\nThey all have to do somehow with color or\n\n36\n00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.217\nblack and white.\n\n37\n00:01:45.217 --> 00:01:50.130\n>> Okay Starting off we'll go\nwith brightness and contrast.\n\n38\n00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.800\nJust click that and\nyou are presented with sliders.\n\n39\n00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.810\nYou can have some fun with them,\njust go up and down.\n\n40\n00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.790\nObviously the image becomes brighter\nwhen you knock up the brightness.\n\n41\n00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.500\nAnd the brightness essentially is\nthe amount of whites in the image,\n\n42\n00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.230\nthe strength of the white colors.\n\n43\n00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.950\nIf they're all up to 100,\nthat's very very over-exposed,\n\n44\n00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.270\nvery white, bright image that's kind\nof painful for the eyes to see.\n\n45\n00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.700\nSo and\nknock it down to get a very dark image.\n\n46\n00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.250\n>> Wow.\n>> The contrast is a difference\n\n47\n00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.310\nbetween the blacks and the whites of the\nimage so raising the contrast will make\n\n48\n00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.070\nthe blacks seem deeper and\nthe whites seem like whiter.\n\n49\n00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.000\n>> Really starts to pop.\n\n50\n00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.250\n>> Yeah, it does.\n\n51\n00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.750\nExactly.\n\n52\n00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.120\nAnd a cool thing about Photoshop is if you\ndon't really want to adjust any of these\n\n53\n00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.620\nsettings, if you don't really\nknow how to make them look good,\n\n54\n00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.000\nyou can always kind of ask Photoshop.\n\n55\n00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.150\nThere's a magic button here called Auto.\n\n56\n00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.250\nIt's the auto brightness.\n\n57\n00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.420\nSo you hit that and then it'll change\nto what it thinks is probably the cool,\n\n58\n00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.940\nthe best choices.\n\n59\n00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.530\nSo this is what Photoshop gave us.\n\n60\n00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.110\nLet me zoom in just so\nyou can get a little bit of a view of it.\n\n61\n00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.310\nThere we go.\nAnd then this\n\n62\n00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.900\nis what it used to look like.\n\n63\n00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.310\n>> Huge difference already with\njust those two adjustments.\n\n64\n00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.990\n>> Just those two adjustments, yeah.\n\n65\n00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.290\nAnd that's photo editing right there.\n\n66\n00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.260\n>> Nice. [LAUGH] >> So.\n\n67\n00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.460\n>> That's not the only choices\nyou have when editing images.\n\n68\n00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.740\nSo let me undo this and\nthen let's go back to the menu.\n\n69\n00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.710\nImage, Adjustments, and\nthen now we have Levels.\n\n70\n00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.210\nLevels are kind of interesting\nbecause it is presented,\n\n71\n00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.000\nyou're presented with a histogram.\n\n72\n00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.860\nAnd histogram's a tool used in photography\nto determine the levels of color, or\n\n73\n00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.220\nthe strength of whites,\nstrength of blacks.\n\n74\n00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.830\nAnd the midtones.\n\n75\n00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.490\nYou have three sliders on here,\nand ideally, in a histogram,\n\n76\n00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.910\nwhen you're editing the levels,\nyou want to have the sliders over to\n\n77\n00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.020\nthe edge of where the,\nsee where the wave goes up right there?\n\n78\n00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.660\nAnd this kind of takes a long time for\nthis to reach its peak.\n\n79\n00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.370\nYou do not want any of\nthis space right there.\n\n80\n00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.930\nYou don't want any baseline.\n\n81\n00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:03.745\nYou don't want a baseline in the image.\n\n82\n00:04:03.745 --> 00:04:07.530\n>> Cuz those are places where I might\nactually get a color or is there so\n\n83\n00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.820\nyou kinda trim all that out?\n\n84\n00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.350\n>> Exactly.\n\n85\n00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.530\nIt's useless.\n\n86\n00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.150\nAnd what we need it for is just trim\nit out and then I'll make the blacks.\n\n87\n00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.550\nThis is probably,\nit'll make the blacks deeper.\n\n88\n00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.050\nAnd I think on the left side,\nlet me check, one second.\n\n89\n00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.440\nYes, on the left side of the histogram,\nthis represents the shadows.\n\n90\n00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.390\nAnd it actually can help you with,\nif you look at the arrow there,\n\n91\n00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.450\nit's a dark arrow.\n\n92\n00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.610\nAnd then you have the right side,\nwhich is the highlights, and\n\n93\n00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.230\nthe middle is the midtones.\n\n94\n00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.109\nSo editing, let's look at the preview and\nwhen I edit the edges.\n\n95\n00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.670\nThis is editing the contrast.\n\n96\n00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:50.630\nSo I'm trimming the excess whites that we\nlost, and then I'll bring up the shadows.\n\n97\n00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.140\nSo those are darker.\n\n98\n00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.020\nAnd then the middle one will\nactually control the brightness.\n\n99\n00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.390\nSo look at the number below my mouse\npointer, and it's right now one,\n\n100\n00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.430\nand it's going down.\n\n101\n00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.930\nAs this number gets higher\nIt'll become brighter.\n\n102\n00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.600\n>> Yeah.\n>> So level's a very advanced way to edit\n\n103\n00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.910\nthe images and the different levels and\nvalues of the black and whites.\n\n104\n00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.360\nBut it is very useful when you really\nneed to get the exact tone of a gray\n\n105\n00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.430\nin a picture.\n\n106\n00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.950\n>> So it's almost like a fine\ntuning of your image there.\n\n107\n00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:23.590\n>> Exactly.\n\n108\n00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.720\n>> Very cool.\n>> And there's also preset too.\n\n109\n00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.659\nLet me just hit those for a second.\n\n110\n00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.380\nLevels, presets.\n\n111\n00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.800\nYou can do the simple ones.\n\n112\n00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.230\nThink of this as, you know when you\ntake a picture in social media,\n\n113\n00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.740\nand you are asked to do\na filter to the image?\n\n114\n00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.650\n>> Right.\n>> And just enhance the image.\n\n115\n00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.260\n>> These are kind of like filters here.\n\n116\n00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.490\nThere are presets that could increase\nthe contrast, just by one click, and\n\n117\n00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.470\nit did just a little bit right there.\n\n118\n00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.540\n>> The next one,\nwe can go down to lighten the shadows.\n\n119\n00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.130\nIf the shadows are too dark,\nit'll really lighten the image.\n\n120\n00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:02.120\nThese are more template things that may or\nmay not work for each picture.\n\n121\n00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.090\nThey're just there for you to take\na look and see how you like it.\n\n122\n00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.080\nIn this case,\nmidtones darker looks kind of cool.\n\n123\n00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.030\n>> It does.\n\n124\n00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.250\nAlso use those as maybe a starting point\nif you didn't even know where to start\n\n125\n00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.890\nwith your levels.\n\n126\n00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:14.390\n>> Exactly.\n\n127\n00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.610\n>> And then also,\njust like the brightness and\n\n128\n00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.600\ncontrast window, the levels has\nthat really cool auto button.\n\n129\n00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.290\nSo we'll move that over so\nyou can see it, right there.\n\n130\n00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:32.080\nHitting that will magically adjust\nyour image to how the optimally,\n\n131\n00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.310\nthe optimal levels that Photoshop thinks.\n\n132\n00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.055\nAnd Photoshop's pretty smart\nwhen it comes to that.\n\n133\n00:06:36.055 --> 00:06:37.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So if we have that and\n\n134\n00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.560\nthen now,\nlet's see what I had before there.\n\n135\n00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.330\n>> Yeah.\n>> And it just pops it just a little bit.\n\n136\n00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.440\n>> Yep, but that little adjustment\nreally makes a difference in that image.\n\n137\n00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.080\n>> Yep, mm-hm.\n\n138\n00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.530\nSo, after levels we have\na bunch of other things.\n\n139\n00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:58.560\nCurves is another visual representation of\nchanging the image and the values of it.\n\n140\n00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.660\nThis, you're presented\nwith a baseline curve.\n\n141\n00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.990\nIt's the diagonal.\n\n142\n00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.920\nThis is the standard.\n\n143\n00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.260\nThis is what the image\nis currently set at.\n\n144\n00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.630\nIf you wanted to manipulate it,\nyou can add anchor points and\n\n145\n00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.730\nthen change whether the image, or whether\nthe curve is more steep or more flat.\n\n146\n00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.480\nThe steeper the curve as\nin this part right here,\n\n147\n00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.970\nyou can see my contrast went up a lot.\n\n148\n00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:26.970\nAnd then if you have a base like\na part of the curve that's flat,\n\n149\n00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.120\nthe contrast is very low.\n\n150\n00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.370\nSo the grade just kinda\nblend in together and\n\n151\n00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.740\nmakes all your images really dull [LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n152\n00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.710\n>> But sometimes you need that.\n\n153\n00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:40.150\nThere's a way like you can just adjust,\nplay with it if you like.\n\n154\n00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.840\nThere's all different styles and\nthings you can do with it.\n\n155\n00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.380\nYou can really make abstract stuff.\n\n156\n00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:45.892\nNice.\n[LAUGH]\n\n157\n00:07:45.892 --> 00:07:47.035\n>> And this beach.\n\n158\n00:07:47.035 --> 00:07:48.635\nAnd now it's that.\n\n159\n00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:49.755\nSo, looks like a different planet,\nactually.\n\n160\n00:07:49.755 --> 00:07:52.280\n>> I was gonna say yeah,\nthat's somewhere else in our solar system.\n\n161\n00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.620\n[LAUGH]\n>> And then,\n\n162\n00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.493\njust like the other two things,\nthere's the magic Auto button.\n\n163\n00:07:56.493 --> 00:07:58.249\nSo if it makes something look really bad.\n\n164\n00:07:58.249 --> 00:08:00.179\nPhotoshop can kind of fix it for me.\n\n165\n00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:02.190\nSo all that and that's what we have.\n\n166\n00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.920\nSo now, let's do what we did before and\ncompare to what it was.\n\n167\n00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.930\nStill, just a little bit of, it's\nsmall changes go a long way sometimes.\n\n168\n00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:12.468\nSo\n>> Yes.\n\n169\n00:08:12.468 --> 00:08:13.825\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n170\n00:08:13.825 --> 00:08:19.310\nThe next item in this little\nsection here is Exposure.\n\n171\n00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.701\nAnd I touched on exposure a little bit,\nlet me undo what I did just so\n\n172\n00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:22.830\nwe can start on the same image.\n\n173\n00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.920\nIn photography when you take\na picture you have your aperture,\n\n174\n00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.630\nyou have your shutter speed, and\n\n175\n00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:35.650\ngenerally if you have your shutter speed\ntoo low, your photo will be really bright.\n\n176\n00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.720\nJust washed out, overexposed.\n\n177\n00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.400\nCuz too much light hits the sensor,\nso that's generally what that means.\n\n178\n00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.360\nOverexposure is too much white in\nthe image, too much light hit the sensor.\n\n179\n00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:51.940\nAnd with this, I can either emulate that,\nor I can try to combat it,\n\n180\n00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:57.270\nso I could enhance the exposure here and\nit looks like it's sunnier out, right?\n\n181\n00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:57.938\n>> Right, yes.\n\n182\n00:08:57.938 --> 00:09:01.570\n[LAUGH]\n>> So I can also make it look darker.\n\n183\n00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.561\nBut say I had an image that\nwas already over-exposed.\n\n184\n00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:05.180\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n185\n00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.630\n>> Like say here, I'll have my image.\n\n186\n00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:09.470\nLet's say this is my image right now.\n\n187\n00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.030\nIt's an overexposed image, I can actually\ngo back to Image > Adjustments > Exposure,\n\n188\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:20.300\nand then knock it down a little bit,\nand try to recover\n\n189\n00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:25.860\nsome lost data when the whole, too much\nwhites, try to bring back some colors.\n\n190\n00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.080\n>> Very good.\n\n191\n00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.390\n>> So that's pretty useful.\n\n192\n00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.960\nAnd also there's other sliders\nyou can have fun with.\n\n193\n00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.100\nThis one doesn't have a magic auto button,\nthough.\n\n194\n00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.340\nYou need to kind of experiment\nmore to get the best results.\n\n195\n00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.140\n>> The next version.\n\n196\n00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.913\n>> Exactly.\n[LAUGH] All right, and then,\n\n197\n00:09:42.913 --> 00:09:46.940\nlet me undo this again,\nundo one more time.\n\n198\n00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.880\nCtrl+Z, Ctrl+Alt+Z will step you back.\n\n199\n00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.850\nYou can also check your History panel for\nthat.\n\n200\n00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:58.120\nNow and next,\nwe have more color-related things.\n\n201\n00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:03.720\nThe first section, you see this little\nbar between Exposure and Vibrance.\n\n202\n00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.620\nThese four things are mainly on\nthe blacks and the whites, and\n\n203\n00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.520\nthe strengths of those, the contrast.\n\n204\n00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.760\nAnd then this next section is\npretty much entirely about color.\n\n205\n00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.924\nSo we'll start with Vibrance,\nVibrance is pretty neat.\n\n206\n00:10:16.924 --> 00:10:21.069\nSo it'll strengthen the color, but\nit won't really distort the colors, so\n\n207\n00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:22.870\nlet's see what I'm doing here.\n\n208\n00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:27.226\nI have a,\nlet's enhance the vibrance here, and\n\n209\n00:10:27.226 --> 00:10:32.550\nit's very very light, but\nnow let's up some saturation.\n\n210\n00:10:35.651 --> 00:10:39.407\nSo now hit OK, and\nit's really hard to see what happened,\n\n211\n00:10:39.407 --> 00:10:44.314\nbut once you see the difference,\nit just pops the colors, and it's very low\n\n212\n00:10:44.314 --> 00:10:49.396\ndistortion on it, so it's not like\nyou're completely wrecking the colors.\n\n213\n00:10:49.396 --> 00:10:54.192\n[CROSSTALK] This is a very\nsubtle Photoshop thing.\n\n214\n00:10:54.192 --> 00:10:58.180\nIt's very good if you wanna have\nthe image, the colors popping.\n\n215\n00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.460\nAnd you can also,\non top of this you can go\n\n216\n00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:06.510\nback to the levels and\nthen adjust them further as well.\n\n217\n00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.630\nSo then you have your colors changed and\nyour contrast changed, so\n\n218\n00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.510\nnow you have like\na completely different image.\n\n219\n00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.230\n>> Wow.\n>> And this goes for\n\n220\n00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:19.310\nall of the different\nadjustments that we're doing.\n\n221\n00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:23.200\nAnd here's a example,\nyou can see after running levels and\n\n222\n00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.140\nvibrance, this is what we have,\nthis is what we had initially.\n\n223\n00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.715\nSo the picture looks ten times better.\n\n224\n00:11:30.715 --> 00:11:32.800\n>> Absolutely.\n\n225\n00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.780\n>> So after doing that let's get back.\n\n226\n00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.461\nUndo, then we'll check the next level.\n\n227\n00:11:40.461 --> 00:11:43.174\nHue Saturation.\n\n228\n00:11:43.174 --> 00:11:46.660\nThis is another way to transform,\nchange colors, but\n\n229\n00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.920\nthis is more destructive or distorting.\n\n230\n00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.280\nSo you will see right here.\n\n231\n00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.850\nI will just move this hue\nslider from the cyan,\n\n232\n00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:59.650\nlight blue area, I'll change to green and\nnow you can really see what,\n\n233\n00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:04.460\nit changed all those blues into greens,\nand it's obvious.\n\n234\n00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:09.813\nAnd, you can do this in a way to make\nit subtle just like the other thing,\n\n235\n00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:14.739\nbut it requires a lot more work and\nthe know how, you just have to-\n\n236\n00:12:14.739 --> 00:12:15.725\n>> Finesse in there.\n\n237\n00:12:15.725 --> 00:12:18.120\n>> You have to experiment with it and\nsee what everything does.\n\n238\n00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.900\nSo that's for that.\n\n239\n00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:24.502\nThat's a fun little tool as well also\nif you wanted to just add a whole,\n\n240\n00:12:24.502 --> 00:12:27.858\nif you wanna just change\nstuff around completely.\n\n241\n00:12:27.858 --> 00:12:29.008\n>> Yeah, nice purple water.\n\n242\n00:12:29.008 --> 00:12:30.074\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n243\n00:12:30.074 --> 00:12:33.880\nit looks kinda like Earth from far away or\nsomething.\n\n244\n00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.518\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n245\n00:12:35.518 --> 00:12:36.716\n>> All right.\n\n246\n00:12:36.716 --> 00:12:40.850\nSo next on the list will be Color Balance.\n\n247\n00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:46.070\nColor Balance is just,\nit balances the colors.\n\n248\n00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:52.580\nWith photography and\nimages you generally have warm images or\n\n249\n00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.400\ncool images, and\nthen the sweet spot right in the middle.\n\n250\n00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.800\nWhen it's too warm the reds are just too,\nthey're there too much.\n\n251\n00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.200\nSo the white might look a little,\nlike a red tint.\n\n252\n00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.220\nSo it's warmer, or\nblue will be a cool tint.\n\n253\n00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:10.330\nSo in this case, we'll see how it looks.\n\n254\n00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.670\nLet's change it over to\na little bit of red.\n\n255\n00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.890\nSo now, image actually looks more\nphoto realistic in this sense.\n\n256\n00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.790\nSo the image,\nit started off as a overly cool image.\n\n257\n00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.930\nSo if I bring the slider all\nthe way back to cyan side,\n\n258\n00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.480\nyou'll see it just gets more washed out.\n\n259\n00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.200\nEverything looks blue and green.\n\n260\n00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.360\nNothing pops as much.\n\n261\n00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.670\nSo you could adjust the temperature\nof your photos with Color Balance.\n\n262\n00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:40.724\nAnd also the other, you can change\nthe magenta and greens, messes with those,\n\n263\n00:13:40.724 --> 00:13:44.723\nand then eventually you'll get\na nice photorealistic image,\n\n264\n00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:47.831\njust by changing a few\ndifferent things around.\n\n265\n00:13:47.831 --> 00:13:48.935\n>> Very neat.\n\n266\n00:13:48.935 --> 00:13:52.379\n>> And it's crazy because you\ndon't really notice that your\n\n267\n00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:57.055\nimage needs these adjustments until\nyou do them, and then, you just, yeah.\n\n268\n00:13:57.055 --> 00:13:59.030\n>> [LAUGH] I've definitely seen that.\n\n269\n00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.440\nYou've got this picture you pull it up,\nit looks great.\n\n270\n00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.555\nYou hit auto on a couple of those\nthing and you're like, wow.\n\n271\n00:14:03.555 --> 00:14:05.134\n>> Yep.\n>> I was way off.\n\n272\n00:14:05.134 --> 00:14:09.500\n>> Yep, exactly, the magic auto button.\n\n273\n00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.135\nAnother thing on the color balance,\nthis adjusts the mid-tone shadows and\n\n274\n00:14:13.135 --> 00:14:13.827\nhighlights.\n\n275\n00:14:13.827 --> 00:14:16.132\nSo if I wanted to go to the shadows, and\n\n276\n00:14:16.132 --> 00:14:20.910\nthen make the darker colors in\nthe image seem a different tint.\n\n277\n00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:25.870\nI can do that, and\nyou can see how I got Mars here.\n\n278\n00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:26.981\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n279\n00:14:26.981 --> 00:14:28.966\n>> And I got Neptune over here.\n\n280\n00:14:28.966 --> 00:14:30.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, [LAUGH].\n\n281\n00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.690\n>> Very cool.\n>> But it's fun to play with.\n\n282\n00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:36.550\n>> So those sliders, you can change down\nat the bottom what you wanna work with and\n\n283\n00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.300\nthen use those same sets of sliders there.\n\n284\n00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.350\n>> Right, mm-hm.\n>> Very cool.\n\n285\n00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.810\n>> Kind of like\nthe categories of the slider.\n\n286\n00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:46.125\nSome highlights we'll mess with those, see\nwhat that does, add a little green to it.\n\n287\n00:14:48.506 --> 00:14:51.185\nSo you can get carried\naway with this real easy.\n\n288\n00:14:51.185 --> 00:14:53.170\n>> [LAUGH] That's why undo is your friend.\n\n289\n00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:54.060\n>> Yes undo.\n\n290\n00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:54.810\n>> History panel.\n\n291\n00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.020\n>> Yes, definitely,\nmake sure I'm back there, good.\n\n292\n00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.810\nBack with our original image, and\nlet's see what's next on the list.\n\n293\n00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:02.740\nBlack and white.\n\n294\n00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:04.770\nAny guess what this does?\n\n295\n00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.830\n>> I'm gonna guess it removes the colors.\n\n296\n00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:08.860\n>> Pretty much, yeah.\n\n297\n00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:09.605\nHow did you know?\n\n298\n00:15:09.605 --> 00:15:11.340\n[LAUGH] So black and white.\n\n299\n00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.600\n>> I've been listening to you,\nyou're a great teacher.\n\n300\n00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.080\n>> So with black and white,\nyou're presented with a whole color panel.\n\n301\n00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.677\nIt's very complicated,\nit looks complicated at least.\n\n302\n00:15:19.677 --> 00:15:25.023\nBut, it's just saying whether it wants\nthe reds in the image to be more black,\n\n303\n00:15:25.023 --> 00:15:25.761\nor white.\n\n304\n00:15:25.761 --> 00:15:29.555\nSo it'll convert,\nit'll kind of grayscale all of the values,\n\n305\n00:15:29.555 --> 00:15:34.474\nthe color values in the image, it'll\ngrayscale them, and then determine whether\n\n306\n00:15:34.474 --> 00:15:38.290\nwhich ones will go to the black,\nwhich ones will go to the white.\n\n307\n00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:42.110\nSo if you have a light red,\nit might convert it to a white.\n\n308\n00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.101\nBut with this panel I can\nswitch it down to make\n\n309\n00:15:45.101 --> 00:15:48.023\nthe light reds go to\nmore of the darker side.\n\n310\n00:15:48.023 --> 00:15:52.719\nSo you can get some really cool,\nmaybe like infrared style pictures,\n\n311\n00:15:52.719 --> 00:15:54.321\nmanipulation on this.\n\n312\n00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:55.033\n>> Very cool.\n\n313\n00:15:55.033 --> 00:15:56.253\n>> Pretty nifty.\n\n314\n00:15:56.253 --> 00:15:59.961\nThis also, this magic auto button is back.\n\n315\n00:15:59.961 --> 00:16:00.814\n>> All right, perfect.\n\n316\n00:16:00.814 --> 00:16:01.342\n>> Yeah.\n\n317\n00:16:01.342 --> 00:16:02.379\n>> My friend.\nIf you mess with stuff and\n\n318\n00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:03.880\nyou don't like it, well,\nthat's pretty cool.\n\n319\n00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.870\nIt made the-\n>> It did.\n\n320\n00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.430\n>> Right over there.\n\n321\n00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:11.490\nAll the blues went to black since\nI told the blues to turn down.\n\n322\n00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:13.460\nLet's try the auto button,\nsee what that does.\n\n323\n00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.901\nAuto.\n\n324\n00:16:14.901 --> 00:16:17.350\nNow, this is the perfect black and\nwhite image, according to Photoshop.\n\n325\n00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.908\n>> According to Photoshop.\n\n326\n00:16:17.908 --> 00:16:20.243\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Which it could be pretty good\n\n327\n00:16:20.243 --> 00:16:22.740\nbut I kinda like darkening that\nblue cuz that looks really cool.\n\n328\n00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:23.760\nThere we go.\n\n329\n00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.360\nSo now this is a black and white image.\n\n330\n00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.940\nThat's pretty much it with that.\n\n331\n00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.930\nThere's another way to do black and white.\n\n332\n00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.700\nThis is a more complex way to do it.\n\n333\n00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:40.878\nAn easy way is to desaturate the image,\nI believe it's under, down here.\n\n334\n00:16:40.878 --> 00:16:42.851\nImage > Adjustments > Desaturate.\n\n335\n00:16:42.851 --> 00:16:44.152\nThis is another kind of black and white.\n\n336\n00:16:44.152 --> 00:16:48.184\nThis will just cut out all the color and\nonly give you black and white values or\n\n337\n00:16:48.184 --> 00:16:49.897\ngray scale values I should say.\n\n338\n00:16:49.897 --> 00:16:53.288\nBecause we'll hit black and white\nvalues in a second, like true black and\n\n339\n00:16:53.288 --> 00:16:55.215\nwhite images, you'll have two colors.\n\n340\n00:16:55.215 --> 00:16:56.178\n>> Okay, right.\n\n341\n00:16:56.178 --> 00:17:01.150\n>> So, that will be a fun thing\nto look forward to actually.\n\n342\n00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:06.190\nSo next on our list we\nhave a Photo Filter,\n\n343\n00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:09.225\npretty much like your\nsocial media photo filters.\n\n344\n00:17:09.225 --> 00:17:12.340\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But this is more along the lines of how\n\n345\n00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.970\nI learned photography and\nhow I was taught what a filter was,\n\n346\n00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:20.810\ncuz when you're using a camera and\nyou have your lens, and\n\n347\n00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:24.600\nsay your picture turns out to\nbe too warm or too cool, there's\n\n348\n00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.960\na little filter you can screw onto the\nfront of the lens to adjust that for you.\n\n349\n00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.790\nKind of like a physical photoshopping in\na way, but it's much older technology.\n\n350\n00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:36.730\nSo this is kind of a way to\napply a filter like that, so\n\n351\n00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:41.050\nin this case say I wanted to use\na warming filter on this image.\n\n352\n00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:42.280\nIt already has it there.\n\n353\n00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.720\nOr it can choose your\ncolor if you want to.\n\n354\n00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.760\nAnd then I'll hit OK.\n\n355\n00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.440\nSo now, this is what it used to look like.\n\n356\n00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.140\nThis is what it looks like now.\n\n357\n00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.790\nVery subtle difference, but\nit just warms it up slightly.\n\n358\n00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:54.470\n>> It did, yes.\n\n359\n00:17:54.470 --> 00:18:00.100\n>> And that's for if you're used to using\nfilters in photography, it's good to have\n\n360\n00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:06.045\njust if you wanna apply a quick\nchange to probably fix a few issues.\n\n361\n00:18:06.045 --> 00:18:10.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, go back to the original picture\n\n362\n00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:15.050\nagain and then next we have Channel Mixer.\n\n363\n00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:15.950\nThis is crazy.\n\n364\n00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.420\nChannel Mixer is awesome, actually.\n\n365\n00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.920\nThink of,\nwe went over gradient last lecture.\n\n366\n00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:31.720\nA basic gradient is from black to white\nand it's just every color in between.\n\n367\n00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.953\nWhat if you want to take that\nblack to white gradient and\n\n368\n00:18:34.953 --> 00:18:36.793\nchange it to something crazy?\n\n369\n00:18:36.793 --> 00:18:41.729\nIn this case, I'm gonna take\nall of the values of what would\n\n370\n00:18:41.729 --> 00:18:46.096\nbe from black to red and\nchange them to black to blue.\n\n371\n00:18:46.096 --> 00:18:47.823\nSo I will cut this down and\n\n372\n00:18:47.823 --> 00:18:51.780\nessentially change all my reds\nin this picture to blues.\n\n373\n00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:53.938\nKnock these down.\n\n374\n00:18:53.938 --> 00:19:00.519\nSo you could kind of mix up colors in\na way that they really shouldn't be mixed,\n\n375\n00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:06.267\nbut it's cool to see you're able\nto wipe out an entire color setup.\n\n376\n00:19:06.267 --> 00:19:07.720\n>> Yeah, wow.\n\n377\n00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.740\n>> So it's a pretty nifty tool.\n\n378\n00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.930\nYou convert colors in different channels.\n\n379\n00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.950\nIn this case, you see output channel red,\ngreen and blue?\n\n380\n00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:17.420\nWe went over this earlier.\n\n381\n00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:24.815\nBasic digital coloring is red,\ngreen or blue for the digital format.\n\n382\n00:19:24.815 --> 00:19:27.755\nThis can allow you to convert\nyour reds to your greens, and\n\n383\n00:19:27.755 --> 00:19:29.675\nconvert your greens to your blues, so\n\n384\n00:19:29.675 --> 00:19:33.294\nyou can have a really funky looking\nimage if you mess with it for a while.\n\n385\n00:19:33.294 --> 00:19:35.340\nAnd there's some presets too.\n\n386\n00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.823\nLet's do black and\nwhite with a green filter.\n\n387\n00:19:38.823 --> 00:19:41.950\nDoesn't really do too much.\n\n388\n00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.960\nBut then, they're all just different\nforms of black and white here.\n\n389\n00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.936\n>> Right.\n\n390\n00:19:45.936 --> 00:19:48.889\n>> And then infrared is probably\ngonna look pretty cool.\n\n391\n00:19:48.889 --> 00:19:49.517\nDecent.\n\n392\n00:19:49.517 --> 00:19:53.407\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So best way figure out how everything\n\n393\n00:19:53.407 --> 00:19:58.830\nworks, I encourage you to experiment,\ntry more stuff out.\n\n394\n00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:59.440\nPretty awesome.\n\n395\n00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:07.100\nNext we have, let's do Color Lookup.\n\n396\n00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:12.070\nThis is if you had a special file\nthat you wanted to pull color from.\n\n397\n00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:16.620\nWe don't have any files available for this\nright now, but they also have presets.\n\n398\n00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.820\nSo we can just check out the presets.\n\n399\n00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.199\nI'll show you a few of them just so\nyou can get an idea of how it looks.\n\n400\n00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.160\nI'll throw a Bleach Bypass on that,\nsee what that looks like.\n\n401\n00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.440\nThat's a pretty crazy filter there.\n\n402\n00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.320\n>> It is, yeah.\n\n403\n00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.900\n>> Yep, and then also some As Direct\noptions, nope, don't wanna open it there.\n\n404\n00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.330\nLet's do this and\nlet's do a Blacklight Poster.\n\n405\n00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.575\nImagine if this picture was one\nof those blacklight posters.\n\n406\n00:20:41.575 --> 00:20:43.553\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> It does really well.\n\n407\n00:20:43.553 --> 00:20:44.330\n>> I'll be darned.\n\n408\n00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:45.410\n>> So now hang that up on your wall.\n\n409\n00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:46.152\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n410\n00:20:46.152 --> 00:20:50.560\n>> [LAUGH] So it's pretty fun.\n\n411\n00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.180\nLot of options here, too.\n\n412\n00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.680\nJust AnimePalette.\n\n413\n00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.535\nDifferent, change of\ndifferent color palettes.\n\n414\n00:20:55.535 --> 00:20:57.320\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The whole image, so\n\n415\n00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.400\nbunch of stuff you can do here.\n\n416\n00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.348\nNext we will go to a different\nsection of this whole menu.\n\n417\n00:21:04.348 --> 00:21:08.388\nThis is more of the artistic side.\n\n418\n00:21:08.388 --> 00:21:09.630\nLet's start with Invert.\n\n419\n00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:10.820\nDo you know what invert would do?\n\n420\n00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.590\n>> I would think it\nwould reverse something.\n\n421\n00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.030\n>> It reverses everything.\n\n422\n00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:15.656\n>> Everything.\n\n423\n00:21:15.656 --> 00:21:16.380\n>> Color-wise at least.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n424\n00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.636\n>> So, in this case,\n\n425\n00:21:17.636 --> 00:21:21.560\nall of the blacks would be whites,\nall of the blues will be or\n\n426\n00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.690\nall the reds will be like a cyan.\n\n427\n00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.059\n>> So is it kind of their\nopposite on the color spectrum?\n\n428\n00:21:25.059 --> 00:21:26.430\n>> Yep, exactly.\n\n429\n00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:27.240\nSo let's try that.\n\n430\n00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:27.910\nBoom.\n\n431\n00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.565\nThat's a crazy picture now.\n\n432\n00:21:29.565 --> 00:21:32.050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So here's exactly what it did.\n\n433\n00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.440\nIt reversed all the colors.\n\n434\n00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:38.880\nAnd another way to do this is to\njust do Ctrl+I on your keyboard.\n\n435\n00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.649\nIt's like a quick way to do it and\nyou just kind of change.\n\n436\n00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.300\nSo it's helpful.\n\n437\n00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.550\nEven if you want to quickly swap\nsomething from black to white,\n\n438\n00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:51.050\nlike if you have a circle,\nyou could just Ctrl+I and invert it.\n\n439\n00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:52.265\nIt's pretty helpful.\n\n440\n00:21:52.265 --> 00:21:57.610\n[LAUGH] Posterizing is\na kind of a funky effect.\n\n441\n00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:03.398\nYou'll just see it just really gives\nyou hard edges around the colors.\n\n442\n00:22:03.398 --> 00:22:04.432\n>> Right.\n\n443\n00:22:04.432 --> 00:22:10.540\n>> And the more levels in this,\nthe smoother the color transition will be.\n\n444\n00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:15.910\n>> Okay.\n>> So let's do two levels, there.\n\n445\n00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:20.350\nIt could get really, but it's cool if you\nwanted to actually illustrate the picture\n\n446\n00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:22.920\nwith a pencil or pen.\n\n447\n00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.756\nYou'd print it out, you go to the,\nyou posterize it and\n\n448\n00:22:26.756 --> 00:22:29.890\nthen now you can see where each edge is.\n\n449\n00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.750\nSo then you're able to outline it or\ntrace it and then add your detail.\n\n450\n00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:36.852\nSo that's a little quick, it's a starter\nfor doing drawings if you like.\n\n451\n00:22:36.852 --> 00:22:39.709\nSo it's good information right there.\n\n452\n00:22:39.709 --> 00:22:44.400\nBut I'll cancel that and\nthen another one on the list.\n\n453\n00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:50.090\nThreshold, this is, remember we were\ntalking about the black and white images?\n\n454\n00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.320\nThis is true black and white.\n\n455\n00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:59.310\nSo it will decide, it will take a look\nat every color value in the picture,\n\n456\n00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:04.020\nin the image, and it will decide whether\nit'll be converted to black or white.\n\n457\n00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.960\nSo if you have a lighter color,\nit'll definitely go to white.\n\n458\n00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.400\nDarker color, go to black.\n\n459\n00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.330\nBut you could change it\nwith this threshold level.\n\n460\n00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.910\nThis is the deciding factor\non whether the image,\n\n461\n00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:16.590\nthe pixels will go to black or white.\n\n462\n00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:19.250\nSo further to the right\nwill make it darker.\n\n463\n00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:22.820\nIt'll be only the whitest\nof whites can stay white.\n\n464\n00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:27.690\n>> Okay.\n>> And then, on the left, any, as dark or\n\n465\n00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:29.160\nlight as it goes.\n\n466\n00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.120\nSo.\n\n467\n00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.297\n>> Really just there's no grays in this\none, it's either black or white and\n\n468\n00:23:33.297 --> 00:23:35.414\nyou're deciding which\nside the color falls on.\n\n469\n00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:37.690\n>> Exactly.\n>> Very neat.\n\n470\n00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.176\n>> So that's pretty fun.\n\n471\n00:23:39.176 --> 00:23:40.510\nAnd you can get some cool effects here.\n\n472\n00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:44.630\nLet me give you one more picture for\nthis because it does a really good job.\n\n473\n00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.570\nSo I'm gonna open a picture up.\n\n474\n00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:48.660\nLet's open up the butterfly.\n\n475\n00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.185\nBring that up here.\n\n476\n00:23:50.185 --> 00:23:53.526\nSo now I'm gonna run a Threshold\non here and see what it does.\n\n477\n00:23:53.526 --> 00:23:54.785\nPretty neat.\n\n478\n00:23:54.785 --> 00:23:58.239\nImage > Adjustments > Threshold.\n\n479\n00:23:58.239 --> 00:23:59.762\nThere we go.\n\n480\n00:23:59.762 --> 00:24:01.266\nNow I can mess around with it.\n\n481\n00:24:03.385 --> 00:24:05.330\nAnd I have a perfect black and\nwhite butterfly.\n\n482\n00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:06.320\n>> That is pretty cool.\n\n483\n00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.170\n>> So depending on the type of image,\nmore things can show more use than others.\n\n484\n00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:15.220\nSo this is pretty neat.\n\n485\n00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.472\nAnd I just really like this picture too.\n\n486\n00:24:17.472 --> 00:24:18.300\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n487\n00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:18.800\n>> All right.\n\n488\n00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.280\nSo, what else is on the list?\n\n489\n00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.800\nWe have, let's do shadows and highlights.\n\n490\n00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.230\nThis is another cool one.\n\n491\n00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:28.860\nLet me do this back on\nthe butterfly picture under here,\n\n492\n00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.200\njust give you a little change of scenery,\nso.\n\n493\n00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.870\n>> Return to the beach.\n\n494\n00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.990\n>> Yeah.\nIf you're done with the beach for a while,\n\n495\n00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:36.919\nsee some other kinds of nature in life.\n\n496\n00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:45.780\nLets run a image adjustments and shadows\nhighlights, well selective color first.\n\n497\n00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:52.960\nThis is more if you would like\nto manipulate a single color and\n\n498\n00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.150\nturn it into another color.\n\n499\n00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:57.317\nSo start with reds,\nI want to turn all my reds to blues.\n\n500\n00:25:00.126 --> 00:25:02.844\nSee if that works.\n\n501\n00:25:02.844 --> 00:25:04.510\nIt just lightens up my colors.\n\n502\n00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.730\n>> Not a lot of reds to start\nwith in the image I guess.\n\n503\n00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:07.910\n>> Yeah, segment of yellows and\n\n504\n00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:12.730\nturn them into, increase the darkness\non the yellows, decrease the yellow.\n\n505\n00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.080\nThen increase the magenta.\n\n506\n00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:18.280\nSo it's very sublet color changing,\nselective color.\n\n507\n00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.840\nYou can take the greens as well.\n\n508\n00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.604\nLook at the background for this.\n\n509\n00:25:21.604 --> 00:25:27.650\nLet me increase the cyan, increase\nthe magenta, turn down the yellow.\n\n510\n00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:30.140\nSo it's a slight color editing for that.\n\n511\n00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.070\nAnd there's no presets.\n\n512\n00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.630\n>> No presets, interesting.\n\n513\n00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:35.442\n>> Yeah that's a bummer.\n\n514\n00:25:35.442 --> 00:25:36.090\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n515\n00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:38.360\n>> And there's also the absolute option\n\n516\n00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:43.190\nwhich can probably lead to\nmore noticeable changes.\n\n517\n00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:45.820\nSo now my greens are popping more.\n\n518\n00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.105\nTurn down the yellow.\n\n519\n00:25:47.105 --> 00:25:48.420\nLet me turn off the black.\n\n520\n00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.580\nSo you can see the preview.\n\n521\n00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.910\nIt does make subtle changes\nsimilar to one of the earlier\n\n522\n00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:56.540\nvibrants we were messing with earlier.\n\n523\n00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:01.330\nSo now, I'm done with this.\n\n524\n00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:05.830\nNow let's try one of my favorites,\nshadows and highlights.\n\n525\n00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.990\nThis one will manipulate the shadows and\n\n526\n00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:11.530\nthe highlights so you can get a really\ncool HDR look if you want to,\n\n527\n00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:15.760\nlike the darkest of the dark,\nlightest to the lights, mix them together.\n\n528\n00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.930\nYou'll probably be presented\nwith this first, but\n\n529\n00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:23.530\nyou want to show more options\nto have some real fun.\n\n530\n00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:28.120\nSo, let's do some adjust in color here.\n\n531\n00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:28.620\nThe midtones.\n\n532\n00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.091\nAnd it's really like making\nthe image pop a certain way.\n\n533\n00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:40.250\nSo let's do a, mess with the highlights,\nchange the tone, and add some shadows.\n\n534\n00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:42.140\nWe're actually darkening that so\nshadows are deeper.\n\n535\n00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.490\nSo now, here's our image\nafter doing all the edits and\n\n536\n00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:47.760\nthis is what it looked like before.\n\n537\n00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:51.705\nSo you can really-\n>> Really brought out a lot of the detail\n\n538\n00:26:51.705 --> 00:26:53.507\nin the bark, and\nthe different layers in there.\n\n539\n00:26:53.507 --> 00:26:54.598\n[CROSSTALK] That was really nice.\n\n540\n00:26:54.598 --> 00:26:57.315\n>> Yeah, it's just getting more detail,\nso it's pretty fun.\n\n541\n00:26:57.315 --> 00:26:58.918\nLet's just keep that.\n\n542\n00:26:58.918 --> 00:27:00.751\nI like it.\n\n543\n00:27:00.751 --> 00:27:05.180\n[LAUGH]\nMore adjustments, HDR toning is pretty\n\n544\n00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:11.530\nmuch the same thing,\nexcept very, there's more glow.\n\n545\n00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:17.130\nHDR pictures are usually composed\nof three images, a overexposed,\n\n546\n00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:22.600\nan underexposed and a middle and\nit's a merge of all three.\n\n547\n00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.775\nThat's why you see on your\nphones you have HDR options.\n\n548\n00:27:24.775 --> 00:27:25.800\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That's usually what it does.\n\n549\n00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.160\nIt takes three pictures and\nthen merges them the best way possible and\n\n550\n00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.610\nusually that involves an edge glow.\n\n551\n00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:36.400\nSo you'll see when the lights and\nthe darks really meet, there's a glow.\n\n552\n00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.270\nAnd that's kind of\na cool effect sometimes.\n\n553\n00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:42.760\nSo with this,\nit allows you to recreate that glow, and\n\n554\n00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.010\neven make a single image HDR,\njust by kind of running the same\n\n555\n00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:52.180\nalgorithms of doing the overexposed,\nunderexposed, and the perfect image.\n\n556\n00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.734\nCreating an even more perfect image.\n\n557\n00:27:53.734 --> 00:27:59.693\n[LAUGH]\nThen next step\n\n558\n00:27:59.693 --> 00:28:05.650\nwe have Desaturate, we went over that,\nthat's just the converting to grayscale.\n\n559\n00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:09.020\nAnd that's pretty much\nit on the adjustments.\n\n560\n00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:12.300\nOther things, we have the matching color,\nthat's if you\n\n561\n00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:16.325\nfound a color that you wanted, and you\nwant to find the same color in the image.\n\n562\n00:28:16.325 --> 00:28:17.120\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n563\n00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.790\n>> It should be relatively easy.\n\n564\n00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:21.626\nGive it an image, and\nthen it will work with you on that.\n\n565\n00:28:21.626 --> 00:28:28.925\nAnd then replacing the same style and\nequalize is a very easy button.\n\n566\n00:28:28.925 --> 00:28:30.037\nIt's like the easy button.\n\n567\n00:28:30.037 --> 00:28:31.235\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It just equalizes the image,\n\n568\n00:28:31.235 --> 00:28:32.965\nmakes it kind of balance out.\n\n569\n00:28:32.965 --> 00:28:34.255\n>> No dialogue at all, it just does it.\n\n570\n00:28:34.255 --> 00:28:34.855\n>> Exactly, yeah.\n\n571\n00:28:34.855 --> 00:28:39.645\nAnd interesting thing about that,\njust one last thing on a side note.\n\n572\n00:28:39.645 --> 00:28:43.755\nIf you look at these menus,\nevery command has three dots after it,\n\n573\n00:28:43.755 --> 00:28:45.760\npretty much except for equalize.\n\n574\n00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.835\nAnd invert and desaturate.\n\n575\n00:28:47.835 --> 00:28:50.555\nSo I guess the three dots\nI wanna emphasize and\n\n576\n00:28:50.555 --> 00:28:55.940\nwhen we see that it means you're gonna\nget a dialogue box after you click it.\n\n577\n00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:59.030\nSo, like channel mixer, dialogue box.\n\n578\n00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:02.440\nAnd then if you go to invert,\nthere's no dots after it.\n\n579\n00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.430\nThat's just gonna be\nthe command right there.\n\n580\n00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:05.590\nThat's all you can do.\n\n581\n00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:07.670\nSo food for thought there.\n\n582\n00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:09.445\nGood information to have.\n\n583\n00:29:09.445 --> 00:29:13.910\n>> [LAUGH] All right Nick, well I tell\nyou a lot of more great information about\n\n584\n00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:16.370\nworking with your colors and\ngetting a little more specific with them,\n\n585\n00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:20.020\nreally getting in there and adjusting\nthem and not just adjusting them to fix\n\n586\n00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.790\nthe picture, which is obviously\none reason we would be doing this.\n\n587\n00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:24.650\nOr to come up with some\nreally cool new pictures,\n\n588\n00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:26.510\nusing some of those tools as well.\n\n589\n00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:29.280\nSo we thank you for that, we hope\neverybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n590\n00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.800\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n591\n00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.320\n>> And I'm Nick Page.\n\n592\n00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.129\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n593\n00:29:35.129 --> 00:29:40.168\n[NOISE]\n\n",

00:00:19.657\nI'm your host Mike Roderick, today we're\ndoing Adobe Photoshop CC 2015, and\n\n4\n00:00:19.657 --> 00:00:24.034\nspecifically in this episode we're\nactually continuing our thought process,\n\n5\n00:00:24.034 --> 00:00:26.630\nthis is a part two for\nadjustments and filters.\n\n6\n00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.500\nAnd we're just gonna\njump right back into it.\n\n7\n00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.860\nAnd here with me of course is Mr.\nNick Page.\n\n8\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.490\nHow's it going Nick?\n\n9\n00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.720\n>> Pretty good, I'm doing well.\n\n10\n00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.045\nLet's jump on it.\n\n11\n00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:34.690\n>> All right.\n\n12\n00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.580\n>> So we're gonna start with\nstarting back where we left off\n\n13\n00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.020\non the magic auto button to do\nthe tone contrast and coloring.\n\n14\n00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.620\nSo let's experiment with this.\n\n15\n00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.550\nSo first I'll start off by\nopening this little flower File.\n\n16\n00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.890\nSo similarly to the other things that\nwe were doing with the brightness and\n\n17\n00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.260\ncontrast and levels and curves and tones\nand all those great, awesome options.\n\n18\n00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.160\nThere are three simple easy buttons that\nkind of do a very bridged version of that.\n\n19\n00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.130\nSo, in this case we look at our picture,\nsee how it looks.\n\n20\n00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.960\nLooks pretty nice, sorry.\n\n21\n00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.620\nAnd then, let's do image,\nthen auto tone, see what that does.\n\n22\n00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.440\nThere.\n\n23\n00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.809\nIt just made a little change,\nbut it enhanced the image.\n\n24\n00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.810\nYou could also, instead of that,\nyou could do auto contrast.\n\n25\n00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.710\nIt's another simple one.\n\n26\n00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.475\nThat did not do much.\n\n27\n00:01:35.475 --> 00:01:36.820\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> That's what-\n\n28\n00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.590\n>> It's telling us that our contrast was\n\n29\n00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.510\nset pretty good already.\n\n30\n00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.800\n>> Exactly.\nYep.\n\n31\n00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.340\nSo it's good when you see that.\n\n32\n00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:47.370\nYou wanna try using different options too,\n\n33\n00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.550\ncuz the contrast you might\nwanna change the color now.\n\n34\n00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.510\nSo let's just try that and the color,\nit actually washed it out a little bit.\n\n35\n00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.150\nA little less vibrant now.\n\n36\n00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.610\nBut this is an example of it's not\nalways good to go Photoshop best\n\n37\n00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.720\noptions cuz it seems easy but\nit's not gonna be good in the long run.\n\n38\n00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.568\n>> Sometimes Photoshop does not know best.\n\n39\n00:02:07.568 --> 00:02:09.525\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n40\n00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:11.870\nYeah.\nSo on a little different note,\n\n41\n00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.920\nlet's do a quick photo\nmanipulation of this right now.\n\n42\n00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.520\nWe are going to change the color\nof a flower using a magic\n\n43\n00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.760\ntool called the color replacement tool.\n\n44\n00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.150\nThis tool is found under the brush.\n\n45\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.390\nSo click and hold, pop the fly out window.\n\n46\n00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.230\nThen you have your color replacement tool.\n\n47\n00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.990\nLet's click that.\n\n48\n00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.860\nAnd with this, this uses brush options so\n\n49\n00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.930\nwe just wanna make sure we\ncan set all the brush sizing.\n\n50\n00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.840\nYou can either set it up here where\nyou're used to or you can actually\n\n51\n00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.600\nright click on your image and then\nadjust your size from here on the fly.\n\n52\n00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.420\nSo here I'm gonna change the hardness\ndown to probably about 75 and\n\n53\n00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.630\nthen let's keep the size,\nI could change that so 132 sounds good.\n\n54\n00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.839\nSo now I'm gonna click to get out of here,\nand then let me zoom in.\n\n55\n00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:05.320\nWhat I'm gonna do here, oops sorry.\n\n56\n00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.900\nFirst we wanna figure out what color\nwe wanna change this flower to.\n\n57\n00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.490\nWhat color you got in mind there?\n\n58\n00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.670\n>> Let's go blue.\n\n59\n00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.805\n>> Blue, sounds great.\n\n60\n00:03:13.805 --> 00:03:16.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Wanna go light blue or dark blue?\n\n61\n00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.470\n>> I'll let you, yeah.\n\n62\n00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.320\nThat's a good blue right there.\n\n63\n00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.160\n>> Like that?\n>> I like it.\n\n64\n00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.580\n>> Let's do it.\n\n65\n00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.550\nAll right, so now I'm going to\nuse my space bar to pan around so\n\n66\n00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.005\nI can get all of the picture,\nor all the flower.\n\n67\n00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:28.520\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n68\n00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.750\n>> What I wanna do is just\nstart coloring the flower.\n\n69\n00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.840\nAs simple as that it's changing the color.\n\n70\n00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.630\n>> Still leaving some of the shadow and\ncontrast or\n\n71\n00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.710\nthe detail of the flower\nthat I can see behind there.\n\n72\n00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.250\n>> Exactly, so it's not like you're\ncompletely wrapping a, I broke it,\n\n73\n00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.130\nyou're not completely\noverriding the colors there,\n\n74\n00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.070\nyou're kind of manipulating and\nchanging them to be the other.\n\n75\n00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.153\nSo I'll just keep coloring away.\n\n76\n00:03:58.996 --> 00:04:02.236\nKeep going.\n\n77\n00:04:02.236 --> 00:04:03.769\nAnd you get the idea on this.\n\n78\n00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.069\n[LAUGH]\n>> Very good.\n\n79\n00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.363\nI like that.\n>> So I'll zoom out and\n\n80\n00:04:06.363 --> 00:04:07.890\nsee how that part of the flower looks.\n\n81\n00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.370\nAnd there we have it.\n\n82\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.190\n>> Looks good.\n\n83\n00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.200\n>> It's a pretty not the best way\nto change the colors because one\n\n84\n00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.450\nthing it does do that's really not\ngood is if you check at the layers,\n\n85\n00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.900\nthat just wrote right onto our image.\n\n86\n00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.336\nSo now it's stuck like\nthat unless we undo it.\n\n87\n00:04:24.336 --> 00:04:28.167\nWe can't really control\nhow the colors change.\n\n88\n00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:31.164\nSo I don't particularly\nrecommend this method.\n\n89\n00:04:31.164 --> 00:04:32.266\n>> Pretty destructive method.\n\n90\n00:04:32.266 --> 00:04:34.290\n>> Very destructive.\n\n91\n00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.380\nIn a later episode, we will learn\nabout non-destructive editing and\n\n92\n00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.360\nways to get around this to\nmake it more efficient.\n\n93\n00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.660\nAnd more usable, make your .psd files,\nwhen you save them, make them strong.\n\n94\n00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.820\n>> Right.\n>> It's what you want.\n\n95\n00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:48.339\n>> Very good.\n\n96\n00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.710\nSo a little shift of a paste here.\n\n97\n00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:59.020\nLet me undo all of this and we get back\nto where we were, original opening.\n\n98\n00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.830\nAnd now we're gonna go over\nsomething called filters.\n\n99\n00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.140\nThese are similar to the social media\nfilters you see, but these are more fun.\n\n100\n00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.890\nThese are great.\n\n101\n00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.710\nSo it's got a filter and\nthen let's go to the filter gallery.\n\n102\n00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:14.720\nThis is really cool.\n\n103\n00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.460\nYou get to see so\n\n104\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.490\nmany different ways to manipulate your\nimage and they're all roughly one click.\n\n105\n00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.190\nOr if you wanna adjust\nyou could be 100 clicks.\n\n106\n00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.850\nBut it's as easy as one click if you want.\n\n107\n00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.750\nSo I open up all these\nfolders on the right.\n\n108\n00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.820\nSo these are all the filter\noptions we have.\n\n109\n00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.460\n>> Wow.\n>> There's quite a bit there, a lot.\n\n110\n00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.550\nSo lets start with the first one,\nsee what it does.\n\n111\n00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.000\nIt's called colored pencil.\n\n112\n00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.940\nIt's very hard to see there, but\ntrust me it says colors pencil.\n\n113\n00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:43.764\nWell click it, and\n\n114\n00:05:43.764 --> 00:05:47.068\nthen now it's making our image look\nlike it was drawn with a colored pencil.\n\n115\n00:05:47.068 --> 00:05:47.683\n>> Yeah.\n\n116\n00:05:47.683 --> 00:05:53.750\n>> The realism of this, it really\ndepends on your level of imagination.\n\n117\n00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.200\nBut you can actually change the pencil\nwidth to make it seem either more or\n\n118\n00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.070\nless realistic.\n\n119\n00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.010\nSo right now I just increased\nthe pencil width and\n\n120\n00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.910\nit looks more like a drawing now.\n\n121\n00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.150\nSo tons of options to play around with.\n\n122\n00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.550\nSometimes if you have a big picture,\nit'll take a little bit to actually-\n\n123\n00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.570\n>> The rendering of that.\n\n124\n00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:14.540\n>> Take effect.\nYeah, the rendering.\n\n125\n00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.650\nAnd it also depends on\nthe computer speed you have,\n\n126\n00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.280\nso keep that in mind\nwhen adjusting things.\n\n127\n00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.750\nBut let's check the next one.\n\n128\n00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.430\nCut out, now this is pretty neat.\n\n129\n00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.130\nGo for kinda a pop art style.\n\n130\n00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.040\nSo and then you could change\nthe different amount of levels.\n\n131\n00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.680\nSo the more or less colors that are used.\n\n132\n00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.586\nMore levels, more colors.\n\n133\n00:06:34.586 --> 00:06:40.190\nPretty artistic right there.\n\n134\n00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.590\nSo if you wanna be a fake artist,\njust take a picture [LAUGH] and\n\n135\n00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.770\nthrow it in with filters on there.\n\n136\n00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.425\nAnd you will be famous.\n\n137\n00:06:46.425 --> 00:06:49.285\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For your friends, at least.\n\n138\n00:06:49.285 --> 00:06:52.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So a few other ones here to check out.\n\n139\n00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.570\nWe have a dry brush.\n\n140\n00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.430\nI'm just gonna go through these so\nyou could see what they do.\n\n141\n00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.970\nLet's not go deep into them cuz\nI'll leave that fun for you.\n\n142\n00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.640\n>> Yeah, there really is\na lot of exploring to do and\n\n143\n00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.700\nit looks like each one of those\nhas its own set of sliders\n\n144\n00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.040\nwhere we can kind of adjust what\nit is it's doing to the picture.\n\n145\n00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.180\n>> Exactly.\n\n146\n00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.338\nSo, sometimes you will see not like it\nreally does anything when you click it so\n\n147\n00:07:16.338 --> 00:07:19.090\nyou really have to zoom in to be 100%.\n\n148\n00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.980\nAnd this is a dry brush,\nit looks like it is painted but\n\n149\n00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:31.210\nyou can't really see unless you really\nmanipulate the options lower the detail.\n\n150\n00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.550\nIt will load up eventually.\n\n151\n00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.230\nBut you can give stuff the artistic look.\n\n152\n00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:41.600\nThat's most of the first\nfolder right here of filters.\n\n153\n00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.806\nSo another cool one.\n\n154\n00:07:43.806 --> 00:07:45.570\nWe zoom out so\nyou can see everything again.\n\n155\n00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:48.090\nFresco.\n\n156\n00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.287\nThat's a cool effect.\n\n157\n00:07:50.287 --> 00:07:51.590\n>> Yeah there we go.\n\n158\n00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.873\n>> So, a few other ones here,\nyou've got neon glow.\n\n159\n00:07:55.873 --> 00:08:01.089\nYou need to change some options to make\nthat look better but another thing.\n\n160\n00:08:01.089 --> 00:08:03.729\nNot all images will look\ngreat with a filter so\n\n161\n00:08:03.729 --> 00:08:05.893\ndon't go too filter happy because.\n\n162\n00:08:05.893 --> 00:08:09.356\nPeople might get annoyed when\nthey start noticing filters.\n\n163\n00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:12.934\nEspecially, when you see, it's fun,\nknowing all these filters, and\n\n164\n00:08:12.934 --> 00:08:14.283\nthen going out in the open,\n\n165\n00:08:14.283 --> 00:08:18.470\nseeing different companies doing\ntheir own advertisements and stuff.\n\n166\n00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:23.800\nYou'll begin to notice, that is\na fresco filter, and it'll really start\n\n167\n00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.575\nto get on your nerves, cuz they probably\nhired someone to click that button.\n\n168\n00:08:27.575 --> 00:08:29.432\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So.\n\n169\n00:08:29.432 --> 00:08:35.750\n>> [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n>> So getting out of the artistic area and\n\n170\n00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:40.580\ngoing to the brush strokes, it really can\nsmooth out your image if you like it to.\n\n171\n00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.480\n>> Yeah.\n\n172\n00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.349\n>> Just give it more.\n\n173\n00:08:44.464 --> 00:08:46.380\nShadows.\n\n174\n00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.390\nThere is a lot of options\n[INAUDIBLE] very fun place to go.\n\n175\n00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:54.540\nIf you're bored with an image,\njust mess around with it and\n\n176\n00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.510\nactually stack filters on it too.\n\n177\n00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:00.670\nSo if you wanted to run like do two\nof these at a time, it's possible.\n\n178\n00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:05.460\nSo the possibilities are endless with\nthis, but to do it, to add another filter.\n\n179\n00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.450\nSo I already did the chalk and charcoal.\n\n180\n00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.830\nSo what if I wanna add\nsomething on top of that?\n\n181\n00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.500\nI'll go down to here, where it uploads.\n\n182\n00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.570\nRight here, it's the new effect layer.\n\n183\n00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:22.410\nI'll click on that and\nthen let's change it around.\n\n184\n00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.700\nSo now I've two chalk and charcoals here.\n\n185\n00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.589\nNow I've changed from 2A sprayed strokes.\n\n186\n00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.930\nNow we have two filters on top of each\nother, so, you can stack as many as you\n\n187\n00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:37.600\nwant and it'll pretty much go until\nyour computer decides to freeze up.\n\n188\n00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.500\nSo you don't want to go too hard on it,\nbut the option's there.\n\n189\n00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.710\n>> Get you some extra memory.\n\n190\n00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:44.940\n>> Exactly, yup.\n\n191\n00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.890\nAnd also,\nthere's an eyeball next to each option.\n\n192\n00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:49.660\nSo if you liked what you did but\n\n193\n00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.730\nyou don't wanna, you wanna see how\nit looks without one of the options.\n\n194\n00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:56.450\nJust uncheck the eyeball and\nthen it'll be like that.\n\n195\n00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:57.830\nFilter's not even there.\n\n196\n00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.250\n>> Okay.\n\n197\n00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.970\n>> So going down further we have\nthe distorts, we did those.\n\n198\n00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:04.780\nThey can look really good.\n\n199\n00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:11.920\nSome sketch ones are mainly\nthey're based off of two colors,\n\n200\n00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.250\nusually black and white but, in this case,\nit's our foreground color and white.\n\n201\n00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.820\n>> Okay.\nWhatever you have set on your foreground.\n\n202\n00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:19.340\n>> Right.\n\n203\n00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.720\nIt actually could be foreground color and\nbackground color too.\n\n204\n00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.030\nSo we could,\nlet's check that while we're here.\n\n205\n00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.770\nSo we'll change this to a red.\n\n206\n00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:28.859\nThen we have blue and red.\n\n207\n00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.810\nSo now let's go back to our filter,\nand filter gallery.\n\n208\n00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.900\nThen make smaller again.\n\n209\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.630\nYou always want to make sure\nyou see your image, because\n\n210\n00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.030\nif you're at the actual 100% level, you'll\nonly be able to see a part of it and\n\n211\n00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.300\nyou won't know what the big\npicture will look like.\n\n212\n00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.919\nSo now let's go back to sketch and\nlet's try one of these guys.\n\n213\n00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:50.680\nConfirmed.\n\n214\n00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.838\nIt will use your foreground and\nbackground layers.\n\n215\n00:10:53.838 --> 00:10:55.090\nColors, sorry.\n\n216\n00:10:55.090 --> 00:11:01.244\n[LAUGH] But you can make some cool\nlooking options [CROSSTALK] Mm-hm.\n\n217\n00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:03.550\nAnd then let's go down to styles.\n\n218\n00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.260\nGlowing edges is pretty cool,\nit has like a rainbow glow to each edge\n\n219\n00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.695\nof the flower so It can be used for\nin certain scenarios I guess.\n\n220\n00:11:11.695 --> 00:11:14.670\n[LAUGH] Textures is used.\n\n221\n00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.990\nThis is one of the ones\nyou see used a lot.\n\n222\n00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:21.080\nespecially I see this one patchwork a lot.\n\n223\n00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.574\nIt's hard to see what's going on\nright here in the big picture,\n\n224\n00:11:23.574 --> 00:11:24.589\nlet me zoom on in here.\n\n225\n00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.770\nIt makes a bunch of squares.\n\n226\n00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.150\nAnd it'll click there\nare different levels.\n\n227\n00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:36.560\nLike tiles that are kind of placed\nwith less care than perfect.\n\n228\n00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.380\n>> That's neat.\n\n229\n00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.140\n>> So you can give your photos\na good texture to this.\n\n230\n00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.240\nIt's pretty nice.\n\n231\n00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.530\nIt's hard to see unless you're\nactually zoomed in on it.\n\n232\n00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:51.810\nOther options,\nwe have the stained glass, which is\n\n233\n00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:56.320\nvery artistic..\n\n234\n00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.900\n>> Lots of cool filters we can use.\n\n235\n00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.330\n>> Texturizer, mosaic tile,\nbut play around with them.\n\n236\n00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.220\nYou'll find some really crazy things.\n\n237\n00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.770\nThere's stuff hidden there,\nit's pretty nice.\n\n238\n00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:09.740\nSo, we're done with this.\n\n239\n00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.720\nThere are other filters available too,\nthat was only a small portion even though\n\n240\n00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.830\nthere's a bunch of filters, that's\na small bit that's only this button.\n\n241\n00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.910\nWe have a lot of options here.\n\n242\n00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.950\nGenerally I'll just\ntouch on each category.\n\n243\n00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.160\nThe 3D does 3D effects,\nit's normal, it's more\n\n244\n00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.035\nIn the newer Photoshop Creative Cloud\nseries 3-D is becoming more of a thing.\n\n245\n00:12:31.035 --> 00:12:31.740\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n246\n00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.760\n>> And\nyou can actually create bump maps and\n\n247\n00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.690\nneural nets of the,\ncreating a texture on your file.\n\n248\n00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:38.870\nIt's pretty interesting.\n\n249\n00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.750\nBlurring does exactly what you think\nit would do, it would blur the image.\n\n250\n00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.250\nAnd there are many different\ntypes of blurring options.\n\n251\n00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.310\nSo you just try each one.\n\n252\n00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:50.225\nFind out your favorite.\n\n253\n00:12:50.225 --> 00:12:50.770\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n254\n00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.330\n>> My personal favorite is Gaussian Blur.\n\n255\n00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.660\nIt's just gives overall good blur to me.\n\n256\n00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.455\nIt's special.\n\n257\n00:12:57.455 --> 00:12:58.266\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I like it.\n\n258\n00:12:58.266 --> 00:13:04.880\n[LAUGH] And then it also you zoom on in\nand you see it like blur a few things out.\n\n259\n00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.824\nSo.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n260\n00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.830\nSometimes you need that in an image\nwhere you wanna get rid of some of that\n\n261\n00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.490\ncrispness and sharpness to the edges.\n\n262\n00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:12.940\n>> Exactly.\nOr add some depth of field that way.\n\n263\n00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.750\nSo it's a great option if you\nwanna blur the background and\n\n264\n00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.600\nkeep the foreground sharp.\n\n265\n00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.810\nThat's a great artistic way\nto manipulate your image.\n\n266\n00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:23.960\n>> Nice.\n\n267\n00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.040\n>> Also, another option if\nyou wanna blur out something,\n\n268\n00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.250\nlike blur out a license plate.\n\n269\n00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.900\nWhen you wanna post something online and\nyou don't wanna post anybody's information\n\n270\n00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.150\nabout the so blur stuff out,\ncensor things.\n\n271\n00:13:38.299 --> 00:13:43.150\nSo many different blurs,\nwe have distortions are pretty cool.\n\n272\n00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:49.150\nThere are also a few different weird ones\nbut let's do spherize, it's a fun one.\n\n273\n00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.680\nIt'll basically like, imagine taking\nyour picture, like a piece of paper, and\n\n274\n00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.080\nthen throwing a ball into it.\n\n275\n00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.430\nThat's pretty much what\nhappens right here.\n\n276\n00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:04.150\nSo your image will just get\na ball just bulge into it.\n\n277\n00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:06.930\nSo let's do the undo and redo that.\n\n278\n00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:07.970\nYou can see that effect.\n\n279\n00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:11.445\nIt's like someone threw a ball at your\npicture right behind the computer screen.\n\n280\n00:14:11.445 --> 00:14:14.710\n[LAUGH] So a lot of fun ones like that.\n\n281\n00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.200\nAnother filter distort.\n\n282\n00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.200\nLet's do the ripple.\n\n283\n00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.070\nSee what ripple does.\n\n284\n00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:32.920\nThis is another one that really is\neffective at more of the detailed level.\n\n285\n00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.220\nSo it's harder to see how it works.\n\n286\n00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.660\nUnless you really zoomed in.\n\n287\n00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.340\nThat's a really 396%.\n\n288\n00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.550\nNow you can start seeing the fuzziness.\n\n289\n00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:46.460\nIt'll take the pixels and\njust kind of zigzag and ripple them so\n\n290\n00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.240\nthat it looks more smooth.\n\n291\n00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.890\nNot smooth, just a different.\n\n292\n00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.360\nIt's kinda like one of\nthe filter gallery features.\n\n293\n00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.460\nYou can see it's all ripply right there.\n\n294\n00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:57.300\n>> Yeah.\n\n295\n00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.860\n>> So that's another one, pretty nice.\n\n296\n00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.455\nLet's do Filter.\n\n297\n00:15:04.454 --> 00:15:09.254\nThere are also pixelations which\nare similar to that of the other filter\n\n298\n00:15:09.254 --> 00:15:11.490\ngallery one that we were doing.\n\n299\n00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.730\nI believe it was stained glass.\n\n300\n00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:15.180\n>> Stained glass, yeah\n>> So\n\n301\n00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.550\nyou can do similar actions with this.\n\n302\n00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.450\nSometimes they take a little\nwhile to load too, so be patient.\n\n303\n00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:29.065\nOther ones, let's undo everything so\nwe get back to our original image.\n\n304\n00:15:29.065 --> 00:15:33.520\nAand then we'll go to\n\n305\n00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:39.230\nrendering, we touched on a little\nbit earlier, rendering clouds,\n\n306\n00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:44.190\nif you want to create clouds out of\nyour foreground and background colors.\n\n307\n00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:49.350\nFibers is really cool, let me show you\nthis in a different little document here.\n\n308\n00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:53.196\nFibers is a, you will see [LAUGH].\n\n309\n00:15:53.196 --> 00:15:59.031\nNew document, all right so\nwe change the colors just to black and\n\n310\n00:15:59.031 --> 00:16:03.583\nwhite and on under the filter,\nrender, fibers.\n\n311\n00:16:03.583 --> 00:16:05.069\nThis kinda looks like wood grain.\n\n312\n00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:06.091\n>> It does, doesn't it?\n\n313\n00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:07.775\n>> So that's pretty much\nwhat it's trying to emulate.\n\n314\n00:16:07.775 --> 00:16:10.967\nAnd you could change the variance and\nstrength, change different style,\n\n315\n00:16:10.967 --> 00:16:13.766\ndepending on what color,\nwhat kind of wood grain you would like.\n\n316\n00:16:13.766 --> 00:16:15.567\n>> Hm.\n\n317\n00:16:15.567 --> 00:16:17.930\n>> And this can be randomized too.\n\n318\n00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.905\nSo you can get all different styles.\n\n319\n00:16:19.905 --> 00:16:20.760\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n320\n00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.100\n>> Just, it's kind of like a dice roll,\njust to see,\n\n321\n00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.700\ncuz no wood grain is the same.\n\n322\n00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.810\nSo keep trying.\n\n323\n00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.040\nSo what I'm gonna show you how\nto do here is make some wood.\n\n324\n00:16:33.244 --> 00:16:34.920\nI'll do this.\n\n325\n00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:35.600\nThat looks pretty good.\n\n326\n00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.340\nSo now my whole image is this grain thing.\n\n327\n00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:44.210\nSo now, let me do a quick preview of\nsomething you'll probably learn in\n\n328\n00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.240\nthe next episode or two.\n\n329\n00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.410\nLet's go back to our layers.\n\n330\n00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:51.960\nI'll make a new layer, and\nI'm gonna fill it with a color.\n\n331\n00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.535\nLet's do kind of a woody color,\nso let's do a brown-ish.\n\n332\n00:16:58.915 --> 00:17:03.070\nThat's brown-orange,\nthat's probably a decent wood color.\n\n333\n00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.660\nSo now let's fill this with\nthe paint bucket tool.\n\n334\n00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.250\nFilled.\n\n335\n00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.085\nWhere'd my wood grain go?\n\n336\n00:17:11.085 --> 00:17:12.720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's behind,\n\n337\n00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.250\ncuz the wood grain's on the layer below,\nso it's still there.\n\n338\n00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:18.570\nIt's just below.\n\n339\n00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:21.480\nSo we'll have to make some adjustments.\n\n340\n00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:26.890\nThere are actually a bunch of different\noptions here called blending options and\n\n341\n00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:32.245\nthese can kind of blend your current\nlayer with the layers below it.\n\n342\n00:17:32.245 --> 00:17:32.780\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n343\n00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.630\n>> So it's a cool way to\njust blend stuff around.\n\n344\n00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.072\nSo in this case,\nwhat I want to do is take this color, and\n\n345\n00:17:38.072 --> 00:17:42.650\nthen I want to make it look like\nblend well with the wood so\n\n346\n00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:46.210\nit'll actually look like real woodgrain,\ninstead of black-and-white wood.\n\n347\n00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:50.080\nSo let's do an overlay or Soft Light.\n\n348\n00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.760\nOverlay looks better.\n\n349\n00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.940\nSo now,\nwe have kind of a wood-looking like.\n\n350\n00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:56.800\n>> Yeah.\n\n351\n00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.340\n>> Thing.\n\n352\n00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.377\n>> Very neat.\n>> And then on top of this,\n\n353\n00:17:59.377 --> 00:18:04.767\nyou have the wood, so now let's\nadd some notches in it and stuff.\n\n354\n00:18:04.767 --> 00:18:06.490\nSo, make it look realistic.\n\n355\n00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:09.422\nWhat I'm gonna do here is go\nback to the Filter area and\n\n356\n00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:13.740\nthen this one thing called Liquify is\nprobably the most fun tool in Photoshop.\n\n357\n00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.025\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is the tool you\n\n358\n00:18:15.025 --> 00:18:18.610\ncan use to make yourself slimmer,\nmake yourself fatter.\n\n359\n00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.477\n>> One of the tools, I've played\nwith this one several times, yes.\n\n360\n00:18:21.477 --> 00:18:22.882\n[LAUGH]\n>> Shrink one of your eyes,\n\n361\n00:18:22.882 --> 00:18:24.146\nyou could do crazy stuff.\n\n362\n00:18:24.146 --> 00:18:27.903\nSo, what I actually wanna do, I did it\non the wrong layer so let me gonna go\n\n363\n00:18:27.903 --> 00:18:31.993\nback and I will go to my layers panel,\nand then I wanna manipulate the texture.\n\n364\n00:18:31.993 --> 00:18:37.218\nSo, I will go to stick on this\nbackground layer, unlock it.\n\n365\n00:18:37.218 --> 00:18:44.840\nSo now, let me go to the Filter > Liquify\nand then here is my wood grain right here.\n\n366\n00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.945\nSo, I want to adjust my brush size.\n\n367\n00:18:48.945 --> 00:18:49.945\nMy brush is right here.\n\n368\n00:18:49.945 --> 00:18:51.565\nYou could see the little\ncircle right there.\n\n369\n00:18:51.565 --> 00:18:52.590\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n370\n00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.790\n>> And then, I'm gonna move it to\nroughly the middle of the picture and\n\n371\n00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:57.418\nthen click and hold and then move.\n\n372\n00:18:57.418 --> 00:19:01.850\nNow you could see,\nI'm kind of fingerpainting the image.\n\n373\n00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:02.590\n>> Yes.\n\n374\n00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.640\n>> That was really fun.\n\n375\n00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.460\nYou can have a lot of fun doing this.\n\n376\n00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So there are other options on the left\n\n377\n00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:11.440\nhere.\n\n378\n00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:16.560\nThere is the fingerpainting one\nis called forward warp tool.\n\n379\n00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.680\nAnd then the next one down\nis a reconstruct tool.\n\n380\n00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.820\nThen you have a pucker tool.\n\n381\n00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.850\nAnd then you have a bloat tool.\n\n382\n00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:27.110\nBloat tool is kinda like that spherized\nball going through your picture.\n\n383\n00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:33.700\nSo let me check the different tools right\nhere, and there is one that's really cool.\n\n384\n00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.930\nYep, the pucker tool.\n\n385\n00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:39.950\nIt will take whatever's in your,\nit's really hard to see,\n\n386\n00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:43.670\nwhatever's in my brush, and\nthen it'll just start puckering it down.\n\n387\n00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.060\n>> Yeah,\nright there towards the top-middle.\n\n388\n00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:45.560\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n389\n00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.550\n>> That's how you would slim someone down.\n\n390\n00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:49.410\nAnd I'll go here.\n\n391\n00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.020\nI'll slim down this black\narea on the top right.\n\n392\n00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:52.858\nSee that's get slimmed down.\n\n393\n00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:54.527\nGone.\n\n394\n00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:55.780\n>> Wow.\n\n395\n00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.420\n>> Then the bloat tool\nwill do the opposite.\n\n396\n00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:05.660\nSo if I wanna go up,\nmake that bigger, bloat it out.\n\n397\n00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.188\n>> You're really starting to give us\nsome of those inconsistencies and\n\n398\n00:20:10.188 --> 00:20:12.570\nirregularities you normally see in wood.\n\n399\n00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:13.480\nVery cool.\n>> Exactly.\n\n400\n00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.120\nAnd another one, I believe it's over here.\n\n401\n00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.720\nThere are options here if you want to\nadjust anything to have more fun with it.\n\n402\n00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.920\nAdvanced mode turns on\na lot of different options.\n\n403\n00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.980\nAnd yeah, it's fun,\nyou just like make some notches here.\n\n404\n00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.640\nJust kind of like wood grain\nis never always perfect.\n\n405\n00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.561\nAnd also if you want to\ndo something else too, so\n\n406\n00:20:38.561 --> 00:20:40.985\nlet's have some fun fingerpainting.\n\n407\n00:20:40.985 --> 00:20:45.639\nI'll turn off the wood grain right now,\njust so we can mess around with the,\n\n408\n00:20:45.639 --> 00:20:48.286\nlet's actually render some clouds here.\n\n409\n00:20:48.286 --> 00:20:54.185\nFilter > Render > Clouds, so\nI'll have some brown and white clouds.\n\n410\n00:20:54.185 --> 00:20:58.521\n[SOUND] That looks all right,\nbut I wanna have fun with it, so.\n\n411\n00:20:58.521 --> 00:21:00.905\n>> LA morning, [LAUGH] got a little smog.\n\n412\n00:21:00.905 --> 00:21:02.260\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yep.\n\n413\n00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:06.220\nLet's go to Filter > Liquify and\nthis is when you feel like a kid,\n\n414\n00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.670\nyou're like a 4 year-old, just paint away.\n\n415\n00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:09.490\n>> [LAUGH] Nice.\n\n416\n00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:10.080\n>> It's fun.\n\n417\n00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:18.000\nIt's a good stress reliever, too, and\nit really gets your creativity flowing.\n\n418\n00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.586\n>> Much better than a whole rake and\na cat box.\n\n419\n00:21:19.586 --> 00:21:24.750\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n420\n00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.450\nLiquefying is really fun.\n\n421\n00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:28.580\nAnd you could do a bunch\nof cool things with it.\n\n422\n00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:29.155\n>> Absolutely.\n\n423\n00:21:29.155 --> 00:21:31.515\n[LAUGH]\n>> So we go down to here.\n\n424\n00:21:31.515 --> 00:21:32.073\nOkay.\n\n425\n00:21:32.073 --> 00:21:33.977\nAnd there's my piece of art right there.\n\n426\n00:21:33.977 --> 00:21:36.938\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n427\n00:21:36.938 --> 00:21:38.548\n>> Next, I think we have to do\n\n428\n00:21:38.548 --> 00:21:40.315\na little bit of sharpening.\n\n429\n00:21:40.315 --> 00:21:40.990\n>> All right.\n\n430\n00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.350\n>> But let's go back to an image for that.\n\n431\n00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:48.400\nSharpening is kind of something that's, it\nwould be awesome if it'd always work, but\n\n432\n00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.170\nit's not always the, it's kind of magical.\n\n433\n00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:57.810\nBut it doesn't always do what you\nthink it will, because if your image\n\n434\n00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:01.382\nis out of focus, then it's\nprobably gonna stay out of focus.\n\n435\n00:22:01.382 --> 00:22:02.570\n>> It's not gonna fix that for you.\n\n436\n00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.974\n>> Right, it could help, but\nit won't magically always fix it.\n\n437\n00:22:05.974 --> 00:22:09.200\n>> Right.\n>> So, that's good to have, sometimes.\n\n438\n00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.528\nSo we'll try,\nlet's do a Filter > Sharpen, and\n\n439\n00:22:12.528 --> 00:22:16.420\nthen let's do just a regular Sharpen and\nsee what it does.\n\n440\n00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:23.910\nNow we'll have to zoom in to actually see\nanything, but it's still hard to see.\n\n441\n00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.410\nSo, you can't really tell.\n\n442\n00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:31.950\nThe overall filters in sharpening, it's\nvery hard to see whether it works or not.\n\n443\n00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:37.084\nYou can go to Unsharp Mask is another\nto sharpen images this way you'd\n\n444\n00:22:37.084 --> 00:22:42.110\nhave sliders to work on and\nmanipulate and see if this will help.\n\n445\n00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:45.260\nIn this case, it's getting grainier so\n\n446\n00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:49.740\nlower the amount,\nthe radius is pretty good.\n\n447\n00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.550\nBut you see it sharpens a little bit.\n\n448\n00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.560\nAnd then the threshold\nyou could change too.\n\n449\n00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.040\nSo you see it's blurry right here,\nlooking blurry.\n\n450\n00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.665\nLower the threshold,\nit'll get a little sharper.\n\n451\n00:23:00.665 --> 00:23:02.130\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n452\n00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.780\n>> But it's very subtle.\n\n453\n00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:09.860\nSo, with photography, it's recommended\njust try to get a clear image.\n\n454\n00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:15.420\n>> Photoshop can fix a lot but you really\nhave to have a good picture to start with.\n\n455\n00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.443\n>> Exactly.\n>> It's better to have a good picture to\n\n456\n00:23:17.443 --> 00:23:18.000\nstart with.\n\n457\n00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.133\n>> Unless you want to be more creative and\njust have some crazy stuff\n\n458\n00:23:21.133 --> 00:23:23.932\ngoing on to kind of divert\nyour attention from the focus.\n\n459\n00:23:23.932 --> 00:23:27.171\n>> All right, Nick.\n\n460\n00:23:27.171 --> 00:23:28.950\nWell, a lot of great stuff there.\n\n461\n00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.960\nGood look at all the different filters and\nadjustments that we can make.\n\n462\n00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.640\nKinda getting into some of those\ncool filters we've got in and\n\n463\n00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.950\nsome really cool tools there\ntowards the end as well.\n\n464\n00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.190\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n465\n00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.920\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n466\n00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.740\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n467\n00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.650\n>> And I'm Nick Page.\n\n468\n00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:47.466\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n469\n00:23:47.466 --> 00:23:51.030\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.900\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.680\nToday we're doing Adobe Photoshop CC2015,\nand specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.900\nit's time again for one of those\nexciting try it out exercises.\n\n6\n00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.301\nIn this one we're gonna be doing\ncolors and filters with Mr. Nick Page.\n\n7\n00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:30.180\nHow's it going, Nick?\n\n8\n00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.900\n>> Pretty good.\n\n9\n00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.850\nI'm really in the mood to try\nsome little photo editing and\n\n10\n00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.470\nI'll show you my workflow so\nyou can get this whole thing.\n\n11\n00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.730\nI'll wrap it around for you so\n\n12\n00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.410\nit's easier to-\n>> All right.\n\n13\n00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.350\n>> Take in.\n\n14\n00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I like it.\n\n15\n00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.040\nAll right.\nSo, we'll start off on here.\n\n16\n00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.290\nI'm gonna load in this\nmountain.jpg picture.\n\n17\n00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.777\nThis is a picture taken in Tennessee.\n\n18\n00:00:49.777 --> 00:00:51.725\nIt's got nice little scenery and\neverything.\n\n19\n00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:52.600\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But\n\n20\n00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.320\nthere's something that I kinda\nwanna change about this.\n\n21\n00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.080\nSo, first off, I will go through\na few of the layer adjustments.\n\n22\n00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.970\nSo I'll go start off by going to layers,\n\n23\n00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.480\nunlocking this because I want\nto make some edits to it.\n\n24\n00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.170\nAnd then let me copy this just so\nI have it so\n\n25\n00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.450\nI have my original to go back to and\nI'll make it invisible, just so.\n\n26\n00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.170\nI always like to do that to make\nsure I don't lose anything.\n\n27\n00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.200\n>> A safety net kind of thing.\n\n28\n00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.970\n>> Yeah it's my safety net so I'll keep\nthat there and then I'll label it.\n\n29\n00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.920\nIf it'll let me label it.\n\n30\n00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.770\nFirst you right click and\nit's not letting me label.\n\n31\n00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.660\nThere we go, double click.\n\n32\n00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:40.360\nAll right So I'll put this as a safety\nnet just so I know it's there.\n\n33\n00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.561\nThis one will be my backyard.\n\n34\n00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:49.558\nAll right, so let me go back and\nselect my visible layer.\n\n35\n00:01:49.558 --> 00:01:53.132\nAnd then what I'm gonna do is\ngo to the image adjustments, and\n\n36\n00:01:53.132 --> 00:01:56.650\nlet's take a look and\nsee what these auto guys do, again.\n\n37\n00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.530\nAuto Tone, Contrast, and Color.\n\n38\n00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.412\nAuto tone makes it a little darker,\nI don't like it.\n\n39\n00:02:01.412 --> 00:02:05.170\nLet's try again, Image > Auto Contrast.\n\n40\n00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.450\nEh, still don't like it.\n\n41\n00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.170\nImage, oops, Image > Auto Color.\n\n42\n00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.250\nNah, they all get too dark and I don't\nwant dark, I want to kind of lighten up\n\n43\n00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.490\nthe bottom half, and darken the top half,\nso it'll kinda be more balanced.\n\n44\n00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.250\nCuz right now,\nthese trees are in the shadows.\n\n45\n00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.640\nAnd you don't even know\nwhat color those trees are.\n\n46\n00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.200\nThey could be brown,\nthey could be green, you don't know.\n\n47\n00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.600\nSo we'll find out with Photoshop.\n\n48\n00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.140\nSo I'm going to go to\nimage adjustments and\n\n49\n00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.500\nthen let's do a edit the shadows and\nhighlights.\n\n50\n00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.169\nI love this.\n\n51\n00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.760\n>> Wow.\n>> Look at that!\n\n52\n00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.295\nIt already made my image look great.\n\n53\n00:02:41.295 --> 00:02:42.300\n>> [LAUGH] It did, didn't it?\n\n54\n00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.280\n>> From nothing to that-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n55\n00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.190\n>> In one click, so I want to tweak a few\n\n56\n00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.060\nmore settings to get this right, but\nI'm liking where it's going so far.\n\n57\n00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.480\nSo let's do a transitive amount of shadow.\n\n58\n00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.680\nI want the shadows to be a little darker,\nso I'll put them there.\n\n59\n00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.920\nChange of tone, see what that does, I like\nit right about there and it's all about,\n\n60\n00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.635\nyou don't really need to know\nthe exact numbers of it.\n\n61\n00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:10.390\nIt's just going for\nwhat you see looks right or looks better.\n\n62\n00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.339\nSo it's all about playing\nwith the sliders.\n\n63\n00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.940\n>> Yeah, there's no magic number for\neach one of these settings.\n\n64\n00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.774\nEach picture is gonna be different and\n\n65\n00:03:17.774 --> 00:03:20.752\nthen your opinion of what looks\ngood is gonna be different, or\n\n66\n00:03:20.752 --> 00:03:24.430\nwhat your market is, so just play with\nthem until you see what you like.\n\n67\n00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.530\n>> Exactly.\n>> Nice.\n\n68\n00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.126\n>> Yep.\n\n69\n00:03:26.126 --> 00:03:27.160\nSo I'm gonna adjust my highlights and\n\n70\n00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.260\nsee raising this makes my\nsky look bluer right there.\n\n71\n00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.805\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n72\n00:03:32.805 --> 00:03:34.780\nChange some tone around,\n\n73\n00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.395\nsee if I can get some more colors\nout of that and the radius.\n\n74\n00:03:39.395 --> 00:03:41.960\nYeah, that really brings\nout the trees right there.\n\n75\n00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.440\n>> Yeah, the ones right above the horizon.\n\n76\n00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.640\n>> Yep.\n>> They really popped out.\n\n77\n00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.320\n>> Yep, so\nlet's change some adjustments now.\n\n78\n00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.580\nThe color,\nthis is washing out the color right now.\n\n79\n00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.020\nIt's looking very bland.\n\n80\n00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.860\nBut when we bring it up,\nnow got some vibrance there.\n\n81\n00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.060\nThen change the mid-tones around,\nsee what it does.\n\n82\n00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.760\nThis is darkening the image it looks like,\n\n83\n00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.480\nso let's bring it back to kind\nof lighten it a little more.\n\n84\n00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.758\nSo now we're here.\n\n85\n00:04:03.758 --> 00:04:07.390\nAnd then let me hit OK to apply that.\n\n86\n00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.478\nNow let's look and see what we just did,\nI'll hit Ctrl-Z, or Cmd-Z depending on\n\n87\n00:04:12.478 --> 00:04:17.690\nif you're Windows or Mac to do an undo and\nwe'll see what difference this makes.\n\n88\n00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.800\nThat's what we started with,\nthat's what we turned it into.\n\n89\n00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.290\n>> A huge difference.\n>> So very powerful image adjustment.\n\n90\n00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.380\nSo let's take this a step further now.\n\n91\n00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.780\nNow we adjusted to how we want it.\n\n92\n00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.330\nI want to kind of have some fun with it.\n\n93\n00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.355\nWe'll see about this.\n\n94\n00:04:34.355 --> 00:04:37.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's do a, I'll make a new layer.\n\n95\n00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.845\nAnd what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna name this fire.\n\n96\n00:04:41.845 --> 00:04:43.320\n>> Uh-oh.\n\n97\n00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.015\n>> With an exclamation\npoint cuz it's fire!\n\n98\n00:04:45.015 --> 00:04:49.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So on this layer I'll go to filter and\n\n99\n00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.630\nI will render\n>> There's a cool thing right there\n\n100\n00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.100\ncalled the flame.\n\n101\n00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.050\nTo do this, though, I'll click it now,\nit won't work, it'll give me an error.\n\n102\n00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.830\nI need to select, and I need a path to\nshow what this thing will be shaped as,\n\n103\n00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.870\nor what it will write on.\n\n104\n00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.540\nIn this case, I'll use the pen tool we\nlearned about a little bit earlier.\n\n105\n00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.620\nIt'll probably touch more on it in\na later episode, but in this case,\n\n106\n00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.620\nI'm just gonna do a quick little path,\nthis anchor point from point A to point B,\n\n107\n00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.330\nand then add a little\nbit of curve into it,\n\n108\n00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.200\njust kinda to hug that\nground where the trees are.\n\n109\n00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.760\nSo now I have this path,\nit's just two anchor points.\n\n110\n00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.997\nI'll go back to Filter > Render > Flame.\n\n111\n00:05:33.997 --> 00:05:36.870\nSo now it's loading.\n\n112\n00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.630\nAnd then we have, this is what\nthe flame will probably look like.\n\n113\n00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.270\nI can edit the length and randomize it so\nit's more like a regular flame.\n\n114\n00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.660\nIt's really no continuity at all,\nit just does what it wants to.\n\n115\n00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.410\nSo here I'm gonna just\nchange everything around.\n\n116\n00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.230\nAdd some width to it.\n\n117\n00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.390\nHave some fun with the options until\nit gets to how I want it to look.\n\n118\n00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.475\nThat's not good, no.\n\n119\n00:06:01.475 --> 00:06:04.224\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I like the straight up and down,\n\n120\n00:06:04.224 --> 00:06:05.640\nroughly.\n\n121\n00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.160\nThat's good.\n\n122\n00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.300\nLet me add a little bit of angle.\n\n123\n00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.900\nThat should be good.\n\n124\n00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.570\nAnd changing interval.\n\n125\n00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.880\nThese options do so\nmany different things so have fun with it.\n\n126\n00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.990\nAnd there's also different flame\ntypes too, like candlelight.\n\n127\n00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.968\nSo you could actually,\nyou can take a picture of a candle, and\n\n128\n00:06:20.968 --> 00:06:24.709\nput a flame on it with Photoshop and\nit would look real, it's a possibility.\n\n129\n00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:28.178\n>> That's pretty darn handy cuz you think\nwith that candle sitting in the middle of\n\n130\n00:06:28.178 --> 00:06:31.042\nyour picture, it really throws\noff a lot of your other settings.\n\n131\n00:06:31.042 --> 00:06:33.070\nYou've got this bright light right there.\n\n132\n00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.890\nSo leave the candle blown out,\ntake your picture, and\n\n133\n00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.120\nthen light it back up in Photoshop.\n\n134\n00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.370\n>> Yep, it's perfect.\n\n135\n00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.182\n>> Impressive.\n\n136\n00:06:39.182 --> 00:06:42.240\n[LAUGH]\n>> So there's also advanced settings.\n\n137\n00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.260\nWhich, even more slider\nstuff to have fun with, but\n\n138\n00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.636\nI'll let you do that on your own,\ntry it out, so.\n\n139\n00:06:48.636 --> 00:06:49.293\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n140\n00:06:49.293 --> 00:06:50.650\nSo now I hit OK.\n\n141\n00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.570\nLet's see what this does.\n\n142\n00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.070\nAnd we might have a forest fire here.\n\n143\n00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.630\n>> Uh-oh.\n\n144\n00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.523\n>> There it is, it's on fire.\n\n145\n00:06:56.523 --> 00:06:58.252\n>> I'll be darned, look at that.\n\n146\n00:06:58.252 --> 00:06:59.010\nThat is impressive.\n\n147\n00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.620\n>> So that's kind of scary, too.\n\n148\n00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.638\nBut there it is.\n\n149\n00:07:01.638 --> 00:07:03.250\nIt leads us there and not here.\n\n150\n00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.105\n>> Yeah.\n>> We're all good.\n\n151\n00:07:04.105 --> 00:07:06.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n152\n00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.210\nanother thing we're gonna do is add a\ntree, cuz we burnt down a bunch of trees.\n\n153\n00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.140\nWe've got to plant the tree now, so.\n\n154\n00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:18.728\nPhotoshop actually has the ability to\nrender a tree, it's weird I don't know.\n\n155\n00:07:18.728 --> 00:07:21.628\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It just seems random,\n\n156\n00:07:21.628 --> 00:07:25.660\nI wanna tree yeah, Filter,\nlet's go to render a tree.\n\n157\n00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.110\nSo, let's render a tree,\n\n158\n00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.060\nlet me do this on a different\nlayer though because just like,\n\n159\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.880\nit's always good to do different layers\nbecause right here my fire is on a layer.\n\n160\n00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.430\nI could turn it off if I want to.\n\n161\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.650\nI want to turn my tree off,\n\n162\n00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.940\nI don't have the option to turn my tree\noff so put that on a new layer as well.\n\n163\n00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.070\nSo now, on that new layer,\nI'll do Filter > Render > Tree.\n\n164\n00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.920\nSo now,\nthere are a lot of trees in here too.\n\n165\n00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.230\nSo this is a weird looking tree.\n\n166\n00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:55.498\nLet me change this around to,\nlet me reset.\n\n167\n00:07:55.498 --> 00:07:56.760\nThere's a reset button too.\n\n168\n00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.780\nIf you had previous settings,\nit's always good to reset.\n\n169\n00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.190\n>> I remember the last you\nwere planting trees, right?\n\n170\n00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.470\n>> Yeah, yeah, planting trees doesn't\nalways go the same every time, so\n\n171\n00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.650\nyou gotta be careful about that.\n\n172\n00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:09.820\nSo lets do a spruce tree.\n\n173\n00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.470\nSee what this looks like.\n\n174\n00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.990\nThat's a weird looking spruce tree.\n\n175\n00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:17.016\nHold on, I might be,\nI might have some funky settings there.\n\n176\n00:08:17.016 --> 00:08:17.968\nThat's why.\n\n177\n00:08:17.968 --> 00:08:22.015\nAll right learning this here.\n\n178\n00:08:22.015 --> 00:08:27.105\nSo what happened, why the tree looks so\nweird, my path is still there.\n\n179\n00:08:27.105 --> 00:08:28.935\nSo I was actually planting\na tree along a path.\n\n180\n00:08:28.935 --> 00:08:30.175\n>> So it was along that line.\n\n181\n00:08:30.175 --> 00:08:31.395\n>> Right, so\nthat's why it looks all funky.\n\n182\n00:08:31.395 --> 00:08:35.225\nSo now what I'll do,\ngo to the Paths panel.\n\n183\n00:08:35.225 --> 00:08:37.495\nAnd I can actually get\nrid of that work path.\n\n184\n00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.100\nWe'll see what it does, good, gone.\n\n185\n00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.860\nSo now my path is not selected anymore and\n\n186\n00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.360\nI can go back to my layer,\nit's already there.\n\n187\n00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.120\nAnd then let's try planting again,\n\n188\n00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.290\ndon't wanna have another path\ndisaster with the trees.\n\n189\n00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:55.450\nSo we'll plant a tree, and this time\nit will actually look like a tree.\n\n190\n00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:56.760\nThere-\n>> Nice.\n\n191\n00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.410\n>> A tree.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n192\n00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.590\n>> Now there are tons of trees here.\n\n193\n00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.680\nWhat would probably go well,\nlet's do a redwood.\n\n194\n00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.615\nThat might go well in the Tennessee area.\n\n195\n00:09:05.615 --> 00:09:07.050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So here's a redwood tree,\n\n196\n00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.420\nand I just think it's crazy how\nmany types of trees they have.\n\n197\n00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.080\n>> That's really specific.\n\n198\n00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.913\n>> Yeah,\nthere's probably some tree lovers.\n\n199\n00:09:13.913 --> 00:09:15.793\nThey just love-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n200\n00:09:15.793 --> 00:09:18.023\n>> I don't know, some tree scientists or\n\n201\n00:09:18.023 --> 00:09:20.540\nsomething, Photoshop Land.\n\n202\n00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.150\nYou could adjust the light direction so\nit kinda matches to where the sun\n\n203\n00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:28.230\nis coming from in your image,\nto try to make it blend better.\n\n204\n00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.130\nCertain trees will show\nit better than others.\n\n205\n00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.662\nYou can see right here,\nthe light is on the left side.\n\n206\n00:09:32.662 --> 00:09:37.432\nAnd then when I change over to here,\nthe light will probably move to the right,\n\n207\n00:09:37.432 --> 00:09:41.570\nlike that, very subtle, but\nyou can change that if you want to.\n\n208\n00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.485\nIt's good to have that option.\n\n209\n00:09:42.485 --> 00:09:46.047\n>> And very important, it's one of those\nthings that will make a picture show up as\n\n210\n00:09:46.047 --> 00:09:49.662\na fake pretty quick, when you see that\neverything's shadow is moving to the left\n\n211\n00:09:49.662 --> 00:09:53.350\nand back on the image, except for this one\nthing that has a shadow coming forward.\n\n212\n00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.900\nSo it's one of those things,\nyou really have to pay attention to that.\n\n213\n00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.260\n>> Exactly.\n\n214\n00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.560\nI can change the amount\nof leaves on here too.\n\n215\n00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.620\nSo if you wanna have a very barren tree or\na very healthy tree.\n\n216\n00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.900\n>> Yeah.\n\n217\n00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:09.170\n>> So I'm gonna go for a moderate there\nand there I can change the leaf size too.\n\n218\n00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:11.730\nMore stuff you can\nexperiment on your own with.\n\n219\n00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:16.160\nI will leave it as it is now and\nthen I'll hit OK, rendering a tree.\n\n220\n00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.420\nThere's my tree.\n\n221\n00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.680\nSo now I'll use my move tool\ngonna move it to right here.\n\n222\n00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.980\nNow let me make it a little bit smaller so\nhit command or\n\n223\n00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:31.770\ncontrol T and then I'm going to\npull up the free transform tool.\n\n224\n00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:36.540\nNow I want to hold Shift and\nbring it down by the corner, so\n\n225\n00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.410\nit will keep it proportional.\n\n226\n00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.810\nSo now I have myself a tree and a fire.\n\n227\n00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:42.830\n>> Wow!\n\n228\n00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:43.636\nImpressive stuff!\n\n229\n00:10:43.636 --> 00:10:44.297\n>> Pretty good!\n\n230\n00:10:44.297 --> 00:10:48.962\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So next, I've made some art now, so\n\n231\n00:10:48.962 --> 00:10:52.017\nI really just wanna frame it.\n\n232\n00:10:52.017 --> 00:10:53.978\nThat's what you wanna do when you-\n>> Absolutely.\n\n233\n00:10:53.978 --> 00:10:55.197\n>> Make crazy art stuff.\n\n234\n00:10:55.197 --> 00:10:56.462\nSo let's do that right now.\n\n235\n00:10:56.462 --> 00:10:58.969\nAnother one of the rendering options, so,\n\n236\n00:10:58.969 --> 00:11:03.056\nto do this I'll start new layer again,\nbecause always layer.\n\n237\n00:11:03.056 --> 00:11:10.540\nAlso label as tree just to keep\nthe less confusion in this frame.\n\n238\n00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.700\n>> Yes, Carol will get us if we\ndon't keep our layers organized.\n\n239\n00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.629\n>> Exactly.\n\n240\n00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:17.019\nI would color code these, but\nI don't have enough time right now.\n\n241\n00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:22.039\n[LAUGH] So on my frame layer,\nwhat I'm gonna\n\n242\n00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:27.080\ndo is go Filter > Render > Picture Frame.\n\n243\n00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.290\nSo I click that.\n\n244\n00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:29.770\nEasy as that, done.\n\n245\n00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:34.553\nI could change a bunch of different\nstyles, I can do a wooden style frame,\n\n246\n00:11:34.553 --> 00:11:36.800\nI can do some, what was it up here?\n\n247\n00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.393\nA happy little vine, look at that.\n\n248\n00:11:39.393 --> 00:11:41.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Happy vine, it's great.\n\n249\n00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.310\nHe's happy.\n\n250\n00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:47.680\n>> Yeah, in this case, I'm just gonna do\na kind of traditional art frame cuz I\n\n251\n00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.200\ndo have a work of art here.\n\n252\n00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.970\nAnd vine color.\n\n253\n00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.750\nThat probably should not be,\nthat probably should say frame color,\n\n254\n00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.610\nbut Photoshop is always\na work in progress.\n\n255\n00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:00.180\nSo let's change it to a, let's do a blue.\n\n256\n00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.230\nThere is a lighter blue greenish tint.\n\n257\n00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:06.970\nSo hit OK.\n\n258\n00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.180\nThere's my frame.\n\n259\n00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.750\nI'll hit OK and I'll render that frame.\n\n260\n00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:16.860\nSo now I want to fit that into my picture.\n\n261\n00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.970\nSo to do that there's a hundred\ndifferent ways to do this but\n\n262\n00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:25.670\nthe way I will do it this time\nwill be a kind of, let's see.\n\n263\n00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.800\nWhat I wanna do, I wanna copy these and\nput them in a, or\n\n264\n00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.860\nI just wanna put all these in a group\nbecause these are all different layers.\n\n265\n00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.370\nAnd I'd rather kind of\nconsolidate them into one so\n\n266\n00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.765\nI could resize them all\ndown to the frame size.\n\n267\n00:12:38.765 --> 00:12:39.320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n268\n00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.000\n>> So to do this I'm gonna\nselect all these three.\n\n269\n00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.610\nSo select one, hold Ctrl, or Cmd if you're\non a Mac, and then click the others.\n\n270\n00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.750\nAnd then I wanna put these in a group.\n\n271\n00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:53.810\nSo I'm just gonna click and\ndrag down to the folder, down here.\n\n272\n00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.890\nAnd then that'll make group one.\n\n273\n00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:00.138\nI'll rename this to My Artwork.\n\n274\n00:13:03.249 --> 00:13:04.630\nSo there's my artwork here.\n\n275\n00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:06.740\nSo you could test out to see what's in it.\n\n276\n00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.120\nIf I just turn off the visibility and\neverything goes away,\n\n277\n00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.910\nthat means I got everything.\n\n278\n00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.910\nSo now I wanna keep this here.\n\n279\n00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:17.260\nAnd then I also want to flatten it so\nit's all one piece.\n\n280\n00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.510\nI could use Ctrl+E to\nflatten this entire folder.\n\n281\n00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.890\nBut now I don't have my layers anymore so\nI'm going to undo that.\n\n282\n00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.220\nI would copy this again.\n\n283\n00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.350\nSo I take this folder now, copy it and\n\n284\n00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.070\ncopy it by going dragging it\ndown to the new layer panel.\n\n285\n00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.010\nAnd then I have my work\ncopy my artwork copy.\n\n286\n00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:39.747\nSo now I'll do my flattened art.\n\n287\n00:13:39.747 --> 00:13:43.902\nOkay so I have there and\nthen I'll flatten this one with Ctrl-E or\n\n288\n00:13:43.902 --> 00:13:47.240\nI can right click on it and\nthen flatten merge group.\n\n289\n00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:49.880\nSo now I have this here.\n\n290\n00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.870\nNow I'm able to,\n\n291\n00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:55.050\nI want to resize this to fit my frame\nbecause you gotta frame your artwork.\n\n292\n00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:55.980\n>> Absolutely.\n\n293\n00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.290\n>> Let's do this.\n\n294\n00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:01.290\nI'll go to my flattened art right here and\nthen I'll want to resize it so\n\n295\n00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:02.780\nI'll do Ctrl-T.\n\n296\n00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.210\nOr Cmd-T on a Mac.\n\n297\n00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:09.170\nAnd then I just wanna hold Shift and\ndrag it inside.\n\n298\n00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.840\n>> We've still got our original artwork.\n\n299\n00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.470\n>> I do.\n\n300\n00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.710\nSo now, that's a pretty cool effect,\nactually.\n\n301\n00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:14.640\n>> It is, isn't it?\n\n302\n00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.590\n>> But I do wanna take off the first one,\nso let's see.\n\n303\n00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:25.360\nThey're both visible, so let me make that\none Turn off the visibility so it's gone.\n\n304\n00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.530\nSo now I have a beautiful\nwork of art here.\n\n305\n00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:29.500\n>> Framed nicely.\n\n306\n00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.170\n>> Framed nicely.\n\n307\n00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:31.184\n>> Ready for sale.\n\n308\n00:14:31.184 --> 00:14:32.551\n>> Yep.\n>> All you gotta do is send\n\n309\n00:14:32.551 --> 00:14:35.021\na check to Nick Page at, no, I'm kidding.\n\n310\n00:14:35.021 --> 00:14:36.439\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n311\n00:14:36.439 --> 00:14:40.360\nit's pretty cool to just see\nhere's our final product.\n\n312\n00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.370\nHere's what we started with,\nit's a pretty big change.\n\n313\n00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:44.190\n>> It really is.\n\n314\n00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:44.920\n>> It's cool to see.\n\n315\n00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.820\nSo, the power of Photoshop.\n\n316\n00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.528\n>> Very good.\n\n317\n00:14:47.528 --> 00:14:49.344\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n318\n00:14:49.344 --> 00:14:52.670\nI hope everybody out there enjoyed playing\nalong in this try it out exercise.\n\n319\n00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.640\nReally cool how we start with that picture\nand end up with a framed work of art with\n\n320\n00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.740\nfire trees that weren't even\nin the original picture.\n\n321\n00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.890\nSo thank you for that,\nNick, appreciate it.\n\n322\n00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.470\nHope everybody out there enjoyed it.\n\n323\n00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.040\nSigning off for

00:00:21.040\nI'm your host Mike Roderick, and\ntoday we're doing Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.601\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:25.680\nwe're going to be taking a look at\nsome of our image correction tools.\n\n6\n00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.140\nYou know, ideally, obviously we'd start\nwith the perfect picture every time,\n\n7\n00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.780\nbut that's not always possible.\n\n8\n00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.550\nWe've got to do some retouching,\nsome fixing, and things like that.\n\n9\n00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.900\nAnd there's plenty of tools within\nPhotoshop to help us do that.\n\n10\n00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.600\nAnd here to help us to walk us\nthrough those tools, is Ms. Kera Page.\n\n11\n00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.890\nHow's it going, Kera?\n\n12\n00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.510\n>> I'm great.\n\n13\n00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.395\nI am all set and\nready to correct some images.\n\n14\n00:00:44.395 --> 00:00:45.265\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n15\n00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:47.120\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so go ahead and\n\n16\n00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.470\npull up Photoshop if you\ndon't have it open already.\n\n17\n00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.830\nAnd we are actually gonna\nstart with a file this time,\n\n18\n00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.360\ninstead of starting from a blank canvas,\nwhich is a new thing for us, I know.\n\n19\n00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.380\nSo let's go ahead and go to Open.\n\n20\n00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.810\nAnd we are going to grab shells.jpeg\nis what we're looking for here.\n\n21\n00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.990\nSo we're gonna open it up.\n\n22\n00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.350\nWe're going back to the beach.\n\n23\n00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.940\n>> All right.\n>> And clearly we like the beach.\n\n24\n00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.230\nSo we're going back to it.\n\n25\n00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.720\nSo I have this little configuration\nof shells and a sand dollar,\n\n26\n00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.040\nand a little piece of plant material,\nI'm not even sure what it is really.\n\n27\n00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.320\nBut it was washed up on the shore.\n\n28\n00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.950\nSo we're just going to go with it.\n\n29\n00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.230\nAnd we're going to play around\nwith some image correction tools.\n\n30\n00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.210\nSo image correction tools are something\nthat you use a lot on people.\n\n31\n00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.120\nBut you can also use them on still\nimages as well, so plants, textures,\n\n32\n00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.670\nwhatever you need to get rid of or\nfix, you can do.\n\n33\n00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.310\nSo let's go ahead and dive right in.\n\n34\n00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.800\nSo we're gonna go to our tool panel.\n\n35\n00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.700\nAnd all the way over to the left,\nyou'll have this band-aid looking thing,\n\n36\n00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.140\nwith a little dotted line around it.\n\n37\n00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.300\nThat is your spot healing brush tool.\n\n38\n00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.230\nSo let's see what that does.\n\n39\n00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.700\nNow you'll notice that I have this\nlittle cross-hair type button here.\n\n40\n00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.980\nThis works like a brush, and\nwe know what brushes do.\n\n41\n00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.130\nWe know how to adjust the brushes,\nwe know how to adjust the sizes.\n\n42\n00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.220\nSo, this particular brush is very small.\n\n43\n00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.430\nYou'll notice that it's nine pixels in the\ntop left corner, so you can make it larger\n\n44\n00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.220\nhere, or you can you use your brackets,\nwhich I'm going to do.\n\n45\n00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.130\nSo I'm going to use my right bracket,\nmake it larger.\n\n46\n00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.120\nNow I can actually see a circle here,\nwhat I'm doing.\n\n47\n00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.500\nSo let's try getting rid of this little,\nI don't even know what,\n\n48\n00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.710\na footprint in the sand?\n\n49\n00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.230\nWho knows what this is?\n\n50\n00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.960\nSo I'm going to just zoom in so\nwe can actually see it.\n\n51\n00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.240\nI'm gonna click, hold, and drag across.\n\n52\n00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.870\n>> Wow.\n\n53\n00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.050\n>> And let go.\n\n54\n00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.020\nMagically, whatever that little thing was,\nit disappeared, just like that.\n\n55\n00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.610\n>> And not only that,\nit put the regular background back or\n\n56\n00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.445\nit made it look like it was never there.\n\n57\n00:02:49.445 --> 00:02:49.960\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n58\n00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.590\n>> Not just a hole in your image.\n\n59\n00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.090\n>> Exactly.\n\n60\n00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.470\nThe reason why that happened is,\n\n61\n00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.640\nyou'll notice up at the top\nwe have a type selected.\n\n62\n00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.330\nThis is our content aware type.\n\n63\n00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.710\nSo it is creating a fill\nbased on the content that is\n\n64\n00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.550\naround my selected part of the image.\n\n65\n00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.760\n>> Very cool.\n\n66\n00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.000\n>> So we can try it again over here.\n\n67\n00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.910\nThere's a little line in the sand\nthat I'd like to get rid of.\n\n68\n00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.860\nJust going to click,\nhold, and drag across.\n\n69\n00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.550\n>> I'll be darned.\n\n70\n00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.920\n>> It's gone again.\n\n71\n00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.270\nWhich now,\nthat you're learning all these tools,\n\n72\n00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.642\nyou'll start to look at pictures and\nthink What has been taken out or changed?\n\n73\n00:03:21.642 --> 00:03:23.990\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Cuz Photoshop really does\n\n74\n00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.190\nan incredible job, so\nI'm just gonna do that a few more times.\n\n75\n00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.670\nThis works really well,\nespecially on textures, okay?\n\n76\n00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.310\n>> Very nice.\n\n77\n00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.810\n>> So now we've really kinda\nsmoothed out our background,\n\n78\n00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.090\nand now our foreground\nis even more apparent.\n\n79\n00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.570\nBut we have this little guy\nover here that I'm circling.\n\n80\n00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.690\nLet's get ride of him, I don't really\nlike him, he detracts from my main image.\n\n81\n00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.090\nSo I'm gonna use a different tool for\nthis.\n\n82\n00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.650\nI'm going to click and hold down,\nso I get my fly out menu, and\n\n83\n00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.860\nI'm going to select our\nHealing Brush tool.\n\n84\n00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.100\nSo let's go ahead and select that.\n\n85\n00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.460\nAnd again, it's very small so\n\n86\n00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.860\nI'm gonna make it larger with my bracket,\nmy right bracket.\n\n87\n00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.450\nNow watch what happens if I were\nto click hold and drag on this.\n\n88\n00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.340\nI get an error message.\n\n89\n00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.720\nIt says I need to option-click\nto define a source point.\n\n90\n00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.230\nSo what in the world is a source point?\n\n91\n00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.490\nSo a source point is basically telling\nPhotoshop this is a what part of the image\n\n92\n00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.930\nI want to be the basis for my change.\n\n93\n00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.780\nSo let's try that out.\n\n94\n00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.520\nSo I'm going to click option.\n\n95\n00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.470\nYou'll notice that I have this\nlittle target type image pop up.\n\n96\n00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.860\nI'm going to single click and\nthen I can drag this over.\n\n97\n00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.980\nSo let's zoom in even further so\nyou can really see what we're doing here.\n\n98\n00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.820\nSo you'll notice that I\nhave this little patch\n\n99\n00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.600\nof sand now that's attached to my cursor.\n\n100\n00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.680\nThat's my source point there.\n\n101\n00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.530\nSo I'm going to click again,\ngo option-click, and option-click.\n\n102\n00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.350\nAnd I'm slowly getting rid\nof this little blemish.\n\n103\n00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.910\nSo this tool would be a good one\nto use on faces because there's\n\n104\n00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.330\na lot of color variation in a face.\n\n105\n00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.980\nSo it might be easier to\nuse a tool like this.\n\n106\n00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.980\nNow, do keep in mind that since this\nworks like a brush you do have your\n\n107\n00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.050\nbrush options.\n\n108\n00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.840\nSo if you notice that the circle,\n\n109\n00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.910\nthe edge was very hard,\nyou can adjust the hardness here.\n\n110\n00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.360\nSo you can make it so it's a little\nmore blurred into the background.\n\n111\n00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.100\n>> Okay.\n\n112\n00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.330\n>> So always remember you have\nthose options there for you.\n\n113\n00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.080\nAll right, I'm gonna zoom out so that\nway you can see more of my beach image.\n\n114\n00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.370\nWe're gonna come over here and address\nthese other shells with a different tool.\n\n115\n00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.300\nSo I'm going to click, hold, and\ndrag out, and we have this patch tool.\n\n116\n00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.100\nSo the patch tool is one of my favorite\ntools because It does a lot all at once.\n\n117\n00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.220\nSo I want you to go ahead and find this\nlittle piece of sea glass in the bottom\n\n118\n00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.750\nleft corner of the screen, and\nwe're going to remove that.\n\n119\n00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.260\nSo what we're gonna do, is this works like\nthe lasso tool, where you click, hold, and\n\n120\n00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.970\ndrag around, and it creates a border for\nyou, a little selection.\n\n121\n00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.790\nOkay, so we have a selection.\n\n122\n00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.220\nNow if you hover over this selection,\n\n123\n00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.830\nyou'll notice that this little\narrow appears that says to drag it.\n\n124\n00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.580\nNow you can drag it left, right,\nup, down, it doesn't matter, but\n\n125\n00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.970\nI'm going to drag to the right because\n\n126\n00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.570\nthe source of the sand is very similar\nright to the right of the image.\n\n127\n00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.090\nSo let's see what happens when I click,\nhold, and drag.\n\n128\n00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.010\nAnd as I drag you'll notice\nthat selection is filling.\n\n129\n00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.980\nSo once I get it to where I want,\nright about there, I'm going to let go.\n\n130\n00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.110\nAnd you'll notice that my selection now\nfilled with a different part of sand.\n\n131\n00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.490\nSo I'm gonna Ctrl D,\nnow we don't have our sea glass anymore.\n\n132\n00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.558\n>> Wow, that is impressive.\n\n133\n00:06:25.558 --> 00:06:28.510\n>> Mm-hm, so you can do it for\nlarger areas too.\n\n134\n00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.880\nSo if you wanted to get rid of this shell,\nyou could.\n\n135\n00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.100\nSo you can drag to any part of the image,\nlet go.\n\n136\n00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.595\nBut notice that this is a little bit\nmore grey than the sand around it.\n\n137\n00:06:40.595 --> 00:06:41.260\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n138\n00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.130\n>> The reason why is because the color\nvariation is different in that\n\n139\n00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.790\npart of the image.\n\n140\n00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:49.350\nSo this particular tool might not be\nthe one that you necessarily want to use.\n\n141\n00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.040\nSo you might wanna use one of\nyour healing brushes instead.\n\n142\n00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.860\nSo I'm gonna undo that so\nwe get our little shell back.\n\n143\n00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.490\nAnd I'm going to command D or\nCtrl D to deselect.\n\n144\n00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.180\nOkay, so that was our patch tool.\n\n145\n00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.260\nLet's move along to\nthe content aware move tool.\n\n146\n00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.170\nSo this is where if I\nwanted to take a shell and\n\n147\n00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.490\nmove it to a different\npart of the image I could.\n\n148\n00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.040\nSo I'm going to use this\nlittle shell right here, so\n\n149\n00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.080\nagain works like the lasso tool.\n\n150\n00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.030\nClick, hold, and drag around,\ncomplete your selection.\n\n151\n00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.020\nAnd I am going to click right here.\n\n152\n00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.680\nYou'll notice that I have\na little move arrow icon.\n\n153\n00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.220\nThat's telling me it's good to move.\n\n154\n00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.000\nSo I'm gonna click Hold and\ndrag it and move it down here.\n\n155\n00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.670\nAnd now I'm gonna go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n156\n00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:33.908\n>> Wow.\n>> There we go.\n\n157\n00:07:33.908 --> 00:07:38.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I just moved a shell on my picture.\n\n158\n00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.650\nSo you can move the shell anywhere that\nyou want, but do keep in mind that since\n\n159\n00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:46.540\nthe sand isn't all one color it might look\na little bit strange when it fills in.\n\n160\n00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.310\nSo if that's the case, you'll need\nto really refine what you're doing.\n\n161\n00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.540\n>> Well, then you go back and\n\n162\n00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.780\nuse one of your other brushes again on the\narea that it filled, like a healing brush.\n\n163\n00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.550\n>> You could, you certainly could.\n\n164\n00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.140\nOr you could use a blur tool or\nsmudge tool.\n\n165\n00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.110\nSomething that we're about\nto go over in just a minute.\n\n166\n00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.570\nSo, for\nour next tool we have a red eye tool.\n\n167\n00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:10.190\nSo, for our red eye tool we gonna need\na picture of a person because obviously\n\n168\n00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.340\nthe shells don't have eyes, and\nif they did, that would be really creepy.\n\n169\n00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.590\nSo, we're gonna open up another image.\n\n170\n00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.590\nLet's go to File and Open.\n\n171\n00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:23.800\nAnd I'm going to select\nthis red eye image, okay.\n\n172\n00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.040\nSo here's a picture of a red eye photo\nthat just happens to be my sister.\n\n173\n00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.780\nI'm gonna be editing this for her because\nshe wants to use it as a profile picture.\n\n174\n00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.190\nSo now, your friends that have\nblue eyes or like colored eyes,\n\n175\n00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.320\nif they have some of those photos where\nthey do have that red eye because of\n\n176\n00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.610\na flash, You can now be the person\nthat change it for them.\n\n177\n00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:41.200\n>> Nice.\n\n178\n00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.780\n>> So let's go ahead and select this\nRed Eye tool, it's hidden beneath all\n\n179\n00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:49.440\nthe other healing tools, and for this\nyou'll notice that we have pupil size and\n\n180\n00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.810\ndarken amount up in the left hand corner.\n\n181\n00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.150\nI'm just gonna leave these as their\ndefaults just to see what happens, and\n\n182\n00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.830\nI'm going to single click, let's zoom in.\n\n183\n00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.270\nI'm going to single click on the red-eye\npart of her eye, so my crosshairs\n\n184\n00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.065\nare lined up, and I single click\n>> Wow.\n\n185\n00:09:04.065 --> 00:09:05.550\n>> And now her eye is black.\n\n186\n00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.910\nLet's try it with a more\noffensive eye into that.\n\n187\n00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.100\nJust like that now that red-eye is gone.\n\n188\n00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.199\n>> That's amazing.\n\n189\n00:09:15.199 --> 00:09:17.000\n>> With a single click.\n\n190\n00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.170\nSo, pretty incredible there.\n\n191\n00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.100\nNow that we have a human up here,\nwe can test out these healing tools again,\n\n192\n00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.900\nbecause they do work a little\nbit differently on a person.\n\n193\n00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.930\nSo, let's go back to some\nof our healing brushes.\n\n194\n00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.870\nLet's go to spot healing tool.\n\n195\n00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.500\nAnd you'll notice that she has\na few little blemishes on her chin,\n\n196\n00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.420\nlet's try to fix those.\n\n197\n00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.560\nSo, I'm going to make my brush smaller.\n\n198\n00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.550\nI'm gonna click hold and drag and\nthere we just erased some of the acne.\n\n199\n00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:47.010\nSo if you have any pictures where you're\nnot thrilled with you complexion,\n\n200\n00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.650\ntry one of your healing brushes here.\n\n201\n00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.850\nYou can also get rid of things like stray\nhairs by click Clicking and holding and\n\n202\n00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.480\ndragging down as well.\n\n203\n00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.020\nSo if there's any part of\nthe image that you don't like,\n\n204\n00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.690\na freckle, any kind of blemish,\nyou can just remove it.\n\n205\n00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.190\n>> Very neat.\n\n206\n00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.350\n>> Okay, so now let's talk about\nsomething called a blending mode.\n\n207\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.410\nSo let's go back to our shells picture.\n\n208\n00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.070\nAnd we're going to experiment\nwith blending modes.\n\n209\n00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.630\nSo my husband, Nick,\nhe went over them a little bit.\n\n210\n00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.250\nLet's go over them even further.\n\n211\n00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.640\nSo I'm gonna go to my Layers panel,\nI'm gonna unlock my layer,\n\n212\n00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.410\nand I'm going to duplicate this layer.\n\n213\n00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:24.970\nSo you can do it like Nick showed you,\n\n214\n00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.930\nwhere you drag down\nhere to your new layer.\n\n215\n00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.840\nNow we have a copy, that's great.\n\n216\n00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.500\nOr you can right click and\ndo duplicate as I've shown you.\n\n217\n00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.100\nSo really there are 20 different ways\nto do everything in Photoshop, so\n\n218\n00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.780\nfind what you like the best and\njust go with it.\n\n219\n00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.600\nSo you'll notice right here we have\nsomething that just says normal,\n\n220\n00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.840\nit's a drop menu, normal, that doesn't\nreally tell us anything, right?\n\n221\n00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.660\nThese are our blending modes, so\nthere are tons of different options.\n\n222\n00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.980\nLet's just click on one and\nsee what happens.\n\n223\n00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.250\nSo this is Color Burn.\n\n224\n00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.570\nSo Color Burn really darkens your image.\n\n225\n00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:02.230\nWhat's happening here is our two\nlayers are blending together, okay?\n\n226\n00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.130\nSo let's try a different one,\nlet's try Screen.\n\n227\n00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.940\nScreening is going to lighten your image.\n\n228\n00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.640\nThere are all sorts of\ndifferent things you can do.\n\n229\n00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.200\nSoft Light, all of that.\n\n230\n00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.190\nLet's see what were to happen\nif you mixed it with a color, so\n\n231\n00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:19.920\nI'm going to create a new layer and\nI'm going to fill it with a color.\n\n232\n00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.190\nSo let's try something really outrageous,\nwhat color would you like?\n\n233\n00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.340\n>> You know me I'm going with blue.\n\n234\n00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:29.570\n>> All right we're going with blue, so\nlet's try a nice deep kind of navy blue,\n\n235\n00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.050\nso I'm going to click OK on that.\n\n236\n00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.540\nNow I'm going to go over to my paint\nbucket tool and just single click.\n\n237\n00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.060\nNow we have a solid blue.\n\n238\n00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.850\nSo now let's try our blending modes again.\n\n239\n00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.970\nLet's try doing multiply.\n\n240\n00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:47.070\nSo now we have this blue\nmixing in with our image.\n\n241\n00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:51.640\nWe can screen,\nwe can do some color dodging here.\n\n242\n00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.370\nAnd really it's adding\nalmost a blue filter.\n\n243\n00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:55.730\n>> Right.\n>> So it's very similar to those\n\n244\n00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.800\nadjustments that Nick showed you.\n\n245\n00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.310\nBut this is a different way to do it.\n\n246\n00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.120\n>> Now do we have to start\nwith a solid color, or\n\n247\n00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.150\ncould we take some of those things you've\ntaught us already, like the gradients?\n\n248\n00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:09.750\nFill a layer with a gradient and\nthen do a blending?\n\n249\n00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:10.360\n>> You can.\nYeah,\n\n250\n00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.400\nyou can pretty much blend any kind of\nlayer with anything that you would like.\n\n251\n00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.190\n>> Nice.\n>> So it's\n\n252\n00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:15.610\ncompletely up to you\nwhat you'd like to do.\n\n253\n00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.630\nAnd again, just click around here,\n\n254\n00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:21.750\nfind out what you like,\nand experiment like that.\n\n255\n00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.250\nIt's kind of another way\nto do an adjustment but\n\n256\n00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.366\nit's fun to play around with\nusing your blending modes.\n\n257\n00:12:26.366 --> 00:12:28.474\n>> Very cool.\n\n258\n00:12:28.474 --> 00:12:32.520\n>> Okay so there a few more retouching\ntools that I want to go over.\n\n259\n00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:37.660\nI'm going to hide these blending modes\nbecause they're a little hard on the eyes.\n\n260\n00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:42.920\nSo, [LAUGH] what we need to do next is\nwe're going to experiment with our blur,\n\n261\n00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.260\nsharpen and smudge tools.\n\n262\n00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:49.250\nSo, I'm gonna click on our blur tool and\n\n263\n00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.650\nwe are going to make sure that our\nlayer is selected, you'll notice that\n\n264\n00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.405\nif I hover over my image I have\nthis kind of no symbol, right?\n\n265\n00:12:56.405 --> 00:12:58.480\nLike your classic don't do this.\n\n266\n00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.330\nThe reason why is because I\ndon't have a layer selected.\n\n267\n00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:05.240\nSo let's go into my layers panel and make\nsure that my shells layer is selected.\n\n268\n00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.250\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\njust blur a part of the image.\n\n269\n00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.950\nSo I'm going to make\nthe shell a little blurry.\n\n270\n00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.450\nNow it's really hard to notice sometimes,\n\n271\n00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:15.740\njust like Nick was telling\nwith the sharpening.\n\n272\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:20.530\nBlurring, sharpening it's kind of hard to\ntell a difference on some kinds of images,\n\n273\n00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.480\nso I'm going to demonstrate it with\ntext which I feel like is a lot\n\n274\n00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.700\neasier to show you.\n\n275\n00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.030\nBut let's play around just a little\nbit with this, so lets zoom in, and\n\n276\n00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.740\nhere we can blur out some sand.\n\n277\n00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:36.190\nYou'll notice that it is kind of dulling\nthe crispness of the image here.\n\n278\n00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:40.540\nSo that's blurring,\nsharpening would do the opposite.\n\n279\n00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:44.870\nSo that's if you really want something to\nstand out, like the detail on the shell,\n\n280\n00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:49.560\nyou would drag this sharpening tool around\nit to really make that pattern stand out.\n\n281\n00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.070\nSo you'll notice-\n>> Wow, it is really popping out.\n\n282\n00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.210\n>> Yup, the more you go over\nit the sharper it gets,\n\n283\n00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:58.950\nbut it gets to a point where it\nstarts kind of adding extra color,\n\n284\n00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.660\npixelation, so there is a limitation\nto your sharpening abilities.\n\n285\n00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:05.080\nThen we also have smudge.\n\n286\n00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.970\nSo smudge is very fun,\n\n287\n00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.515\nit's very similar to the liquefy\ntool that Nick really likes.\n\n288\n00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:09.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n289\n00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:12.270\nlet's just go ahead and smudge this up.\n\n290\n00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.670\nOkay, our pattern's going away, adios.\n\n291\n00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.012\nLet's do some Circle action here.\n\n292\n00:14:17.012 --> 00:14:18.396\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n293\n00:14:18.396 --> 00:14:19.892\nwe're really distorting our image now.\n\n294\n00:14:19.892 --> 00:14:20.930\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n295\n00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.140\nyou can see where it's\nblurring it right in.\n\n296\n00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.170\nYep, you're smudging it.\n\n297\n00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:24.770\n>> Yeah, so\n\n298\n00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:28.290\nthe smudge might be good if let's say that\nyou're creating some kind of document.\n\n299\n00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:33.100\nYou want it to look like water\nspilled on it, you can smudge it out.\n\n300\n00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.830\nOr if you wanted to smudge out a license\nplate or a face, you can do that as well.\n\n301\n00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:37.580\n>> Nice.\n\n302\n00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.390\n>> There are a few more\nimage correction tools.\n\n303\n00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.970\nThere's also dodge, burn, and sponge.\n\n304\n00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.500\nSo dodge lightens an area.\n\n305\n00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.290\nSo let's test it over here on this shell.\n\n306\n00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.290\nThe other way I could have gotten\nto the shell, as a reminder,\n\n307\n00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.600\nis by using our hand tool.\n\n308\n00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.850\nSo if I were to click on the spacebar,\nthe little hand comes up and\n\n309\n00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.250\nI can navigate in here.\n\n310\n00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.260\nAll right, so, let's dodge.\n\n311\n00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.710\nSo dodging this shell you'll notice\nthat it's getting lighter and lighter.\n\n312\n00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.330\nHere we go.\n\n313\n00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.145\nSo now it's kind of a bright white.\n\n314\n00:15:07.145 --> 00:15:08.840\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n315\n00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.340\n>> Okay.\n\n316\n00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.650\nNow let's try burning.\n\n317\n00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.300\nSo let's burn the sand dollar.\n\n318\n00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:18.290\nSo you'll notice that as I'm burning\nIt's adding almost a brown tint.\n\n319\n00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.930\nIt's as if you were to\ntinge it with a flame here.\n\n320\n00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:24.060\nSo if you're trying to make\nsomething look antiqued,\n\n321\n00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.830\nthis is one way to do\nit with your burn tool.\n\n322\n00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.070\n>> Very neat.\n\n323\n00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.260\n>> And then we have the sponge tool.\n\n324\n00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.290\nSo the sponge tool is a saturation tool.\n\n325\n00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:36.500\nSo as you go over the shell,\nyou'll notice the saturation here.\n\n326\n00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.820\nThose are some examples.\n\n327\n00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.800\nLike I said, I want to show you on text,\nso let's open up another image.\n\n328\n00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:49.210\nLet's go to File and Open,\nand let's open Frame.\n\n329\n00:15:53.222 --> 00:15:56.930\nSo, the text is pretty clear here,\nbut we can make it even more clear.\n\n330\n00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.090\nSo let's use our sharpen tool.\n\n331\n00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:03.560\nAnd I'm going to click and\nkind of drag over the letters.\n\n332\n00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.000\nThere you'll notice now\nthe e is more apparent.\n\n333\n00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.520\nLet's do the same thing with the r.\n\n334\n00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.310\nSo this is actual handwriting.\n\n335\n00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:10.020\nSo-\n>> Wow.\n\n336\n00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.120\n>> It really brings out\nthe crispness of the letters here.\n\n337\n00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.070\nOkay so we've sharpened that,\nthat's a lot easier to read now.\n\n338\n00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.290\nNow we can do the opposite as well,\nwe can also blur it out.\n\n339\n00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:25.990\nSo if you didn't want to\nsee exactly what it said.\n\n340\n00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.230\nSo you know kinda blurring it out some.\n\n341\n00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:33.050\nThat way, you might want to do this if you\ndon't want the text to be the focal point\n\n342\n00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.870\nof your image.\n\n343\n00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:39.150\nThere, we can blur it out,\nor you can also smudge it.\n\n344\n00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.930\nSo smudging is really severe.\n\n345\n00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.987\nSo there,\nI just spilled water on the please.\n\n346\n00:16:45.987 --> 00:16:47.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You might\n\n347\n00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.000\nwant to do that to a restaurant menu.\n\n348\n00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.600\nSometimes, you're talking with your hands,\nand all of a sudden,\n\n349\n00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.460\nthe water is everywhere.\n\n350\n00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.970\n>> All right.\n>> So if you want to make it look like you\n\n351\n00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.990\nspilled across the menu, you can.\n\n352\n00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.770\n>> Very cool.\n\n353\n00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:57.470\n>> All right.\n\n354\n00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:59.100\nSo those blending modes I showed you.\n\n355\n00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.840\nI, kind of, want to show you again\nwith the different kind of image\n\n356\n00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.900\nother than the shells, just so you can\nsee what all it's capable of doing.\n\n357\n00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.219\nSo let's open our bridge picture.\n\n358\n00:17:10.883 --> 00:17:14.937\nOkay, this is a lovely image here,\nbut it can look different, so\n\n359\n00:17:14.937 --> 00:17:17.020\nlet's go ahead and copy itself.\n\n360\n00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.380\nSo I'm gonna drag, we're gonna copy.\n\n361\n00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.670\nLet's blend it together.\n\n362\n00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.350\nLet's do color burn here.\n\n363\n00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:27.520\nSo if we want it to look like a different\ntime of day, we can do color burn.\n\n364\n00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.490\nWe can also lighten it up so\nmaybe it's more like morning.\n\n365\n00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.220\nYou can do hard light,\nvivid light, anything like that.\n\n366\n00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:39.890\nHard mix, so, really tons and\ntons of different options here.\n\n367\n00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.270\nBut remember when you add a color to\nit it will really adjust your image.\n\n368\n00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:47.630\nSo let's say that you want\nthis to look vintage, okay so\n\n369\n00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.040\nmaybe this picture was\ntaken in the seventies.\n\n370\n00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.350\nMaybe your parents took this picture, or\n\n371\n00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:55.780\nat least they wanted to make it\nlook like they took the picture.\n\n372\n00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.760\nLet's go ahead and find a nice warm color.\n\n373\n00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.710\nLet's use kind of a yellow,\n\n374\n00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.510\ncuz older pictures tend to\nhave a yellow tint to them.\n\n375\n00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:04.650\nSo I'm gonna create a fill layer.\n\n376\n00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:09.920\nAnd let's go ahead and,\nthat might be a little bit too much,\n\n377\n00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.140\nbut it kind of gives\nthe effect that I want.\n\n378\n00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:17.070\nNow I do have options with my layers\nwhere I can change the opacity and fill.\n\n379\n00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.623\nSo let's try that,\nlet's lower the opacity on here.\n\n380\n00:18:22.571 --> 00:18:24.330\nThere we go.\n\n381\n00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.170\nThat's about what I want.\n\n382\n00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:30.710\nAnd again, you can try additional blending\nmodes or you can blend one of your\n\n383\n00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:34.390\nother pictures differently, and\nit'll really change the image as a whole.\n\n384\n00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:37.620\nSo, this is a fun way to\nadjust it on a layer by layer.\n\n385\n00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.650\nWe don't want to subtract.\n\n386\n00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.980\nOn a layer by layer basis.\n\n387\n00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.310\nSo that way you can really adjust an image\nand have a little bit more freedom than\n\n388\n00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.960\nif you were to just do\nan entire adjustment layer.\n\n389\n00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.480\n>> Very cool,\nall right a lot of great stuff there.\n\n390\n00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:55.680\nAgain more of those image correction\ntools, some really amazing things\n\n391\n00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.690\nwe can do with our pictures to take\nsomething that we've shot and we liked,\n\n392\n00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.410\nbut there's a couple issues with it.\n\n393\n00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.630\nWe can fix them right up,\nget rid of those red eyes,\n\n394\n00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.530\nmove shells across the beach whatever\nit is, we can do with Photoshop.\n\n395\n00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.670\nSo thank you there, Kera,\nwe appreciate that.\n\n396\n00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.520\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n397\n00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.110\nSigning off for IT PRO TV,\nI'm Mike Roberick.\n\n398\n00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.757\n>> And I'm Kera Page.\n\n399\n00:19:14.757 --> 00:19:18.120\n>>

--> 00:00:21.071\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.\n\n4\n00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:24.486\nIt's time again for\none of those fun and exciting,\n\n5\n00:00:24.486 --> 00:00:28.310\ntry it out, so\nthis one with our image correction tools.\n\n6\n00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.060\nAnd here to help us walk through\nall of that, is Ms. Kara Page.\n\n7\n00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.080\nHow's it going Kara?\n\n8\n00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.720\n>> I'm great,\n\n9\n00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.470\nlet's go ahead and test out your knowledge\nwith these image correction tools.\n\n10\n00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.340\n>> Alright.\n\n11\n00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.770\n>> So get Photoshop up and\ngoing, as always.\n\n12\n00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.830\nAnd we are going to be opening up an\nimage, so let's go to File and Open, and\n\n13\n00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.344\nwe're going to select this vacation.jpeg.\n\n14\n00:00:49.344 --> 00:00:54.570\nSo, here's a nice little picture\nof my sister and I on a cruise.\n\n15\n00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.870\nReally fun times but, looking back\nat this picture a few years later,\n\n16\n00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.750\nwe realize our faces weren't that clear,\nit can be fixed a bit.\n\n17\n00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.960\nSo, what we're gonna do first is we're\ngoing to duplicate this background layer.\n\n18\n00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.460\nSo I'm going to unlock it,\nlet's duplicate it and\n\n19\n00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.000\nI'm gonna name layer zero original,\nand then layer zero copy, edited.\n\n20\n00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.440\nThe reason why I'm doing\nthis is because one,\n\n21\n00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.750\nit's not as destructive to the original,\nand two, because I want\n\n22\n00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.240\nto be able to show you the difference\nbetween our original and our edited photo.\n\n23\n00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.790\nOkay, so what we're gonna\ndo first is we are going to\n\n24\n00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.090\nfix some of the blemishes on our faces.\n\n25\n00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.820\nSo make sure that you're on your\nedited layer and let's go over\n\n26\n00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.890\nto our healing tools, and let's try\nto spot healing brush tool first.\n\n27\n00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.880\nSo let's zoom in, and you'll notice right\nhere on my face there is a tiny little\n\n28\n00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.650\nbump, let's go ahead and\nclick and get rid of that.\n\n29\n00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.860\nSo you can kind of look around,\nlook for anything.\n\n30\n00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.000\nThis freckle, I have it but\nI didn't have concealer that day.\n\n31\n00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.525\nSo let's just go ahead and conceal it.\n\n32\n00:01:59.525 --> 00:02:00.905\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n33\n00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:01.599\n>> It's gone.\n\n34\n00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:02.310\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n35\n00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.700\nSo really if you If you wanna fix\nup your face a little bit, you can.\n\n36\n00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.700\nIf you didn't put on makeup, or\n\n37\n00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.095\nyour makeup's not exactly like you like,\nyou can tweak it in Photoshop.\n\n38\n00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:12.603\n[LAUGH]\n>> Nice.\n\n39\n00:02:12.603 --> 00:02:16.270\n[LAUGH] >> So there is a little hair of\nhers that's kinda overlapping my face.\n\n40\n00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.730\nAnd you can see it when we're zoomed out.\n\n41\n00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.170\nIt's kinda distracting, this little hair.\n\n42\n00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.260\nSo let's zoom in and\nlet's try to get rid of that as well,\n\n43\n00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.600\nso let's try doing this big brush.\n\n44\n00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.130\nSo with this big brush\nsize you'll notice that it\n\n45\n00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.790\nkind of looks streaky which is not\nwhat I want, so I'm gonna undo that.\n\n46\n00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.160\nLet's lower our brush size quite a bit so\n\n47\n00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.170\nthat way it's just about\nthe size of the strand.\n\n48\n00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.670\nSo that way when you're clicking,\nit's not quite as noticeable.\n\n49\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.940\nOkay, let's zoom out.\n\n50\n00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.360\nThere, much better,\nher hair's not in front of my eye.\n\n51\n00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.100\nSo now let's go over to Kyleen, and\ndo a little bit on her face as well.\n\n52\n00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.620\nSo her face,\nshe has a lot more rosacea than I do.\n\n53\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.805\nWe actually don't really\nlook anything alike.\n\n54\n00:02:59.805 --> 00:03:00.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In this picture,\n\n55\n00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.295\nwe kind of look alike but in person,\nbelieve me we're really nothing alike.\n\n56\n00:03:03.295 --> 00:03:04.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n57\n00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.050\nwe're going to need to use this\nhealing brush tool with her because,\n\n58\n00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.520\nif we were to use the spot healing brush\nit kind of does some weird things with\n\n59\n00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.310\nthe redness in her skin.\n\n60\n00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.810\nSo lets zoom in and\nI will make my brush a lot smaller.\n\n61\n00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.080\nAnd remember we need to create a source\npoint for this, so I'm going to Option,\n\n62\n00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.510\nclick and then just click and\ncover up this little area here.\n\n63\n00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.100\nOkay, you can zoom out.\n\n64\n00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.460\nThere's a spot on her cheek,\nlet's go in and do that.\n\n65\n00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.300\nSo I'm gonna use my spacebar to move so we\ncan really see what we're looking at here.\n\n66\n00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.060\nNow you'll notice, if I were to click now,\nmy source point is still\n\n67\n00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.040\nthat lighter part of her face, so\nwe need to create a new source point.\n\n68\n00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.090\nSo,let's Ctrl click, and\nthen single click right here, there we go.\n\n69\n00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.270\nSee, continue to go around the face,\n\n70\n00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.920\nreally figure out what kind of part\nof the image you want to fix up.\n\n71\n00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.240\nBut that's already starting\nto look a lot better.\n\n72\n00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.280\nNow let's see what would happen if we\nblended these two together a little bit.\n\n73\n00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.970\nSo let's change our blending mode,\nand let's try doing lighten.\n\n74\n00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.090\nOkay not much of a difference.\n\n75\n00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.890\nScreen, big difference, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.970\nThis is as if we were to have\na huge flash go off in our face,\n\n77\n00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.460\nprobably not what we want.\n\n78\n00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.070\nSo you'll just have to figure\nout what exactly you like.\n\n79\n00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.050\nSo multiply, maybe if I wanted it to look\nlike this picture was taken in the dark,\n\n80\n00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.610\nthat might be what we'd want.\n\n81\n00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.720\nBut let's go to lighten, since it's not\nas abrasive, it's not a huge change.\n\n82\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.480\nOkay, so we also learned about things\nlike Sharpening, things like that.\n\n83\n00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.740\nSo let's play around with those.\n\n84\n00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.310\nSo let's come over here\nto our blur tool first.\n\n85\n00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.060\nLet's say that there's something\nthat we wanna just blur out ever so\n\n86\n00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.040\nslightly, maybe it's the shine\non one of these bulbs over here.\n\n87\n00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.030\nIt could be whatever you want.\n\n88\n00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.130\nSo let's make our brush a little smaller.\n\n89\n00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.210\nLet's kind of Blur this out ever so\nslightly.\n\n90\n00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.030\nAgain, blurring and sharpening doesn't\nlook like it does all that much, but\n\n91\n00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.750\nit is subtle, subtly change the image.\n\n92\n00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.230\nWe can also sharpen parts of the tree,\ncuz it's a little bit blurred here.\n\n93\n00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.030\nSo, let's go to sharpen,\nand if you drag this over,\n\n94\n00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.420\nit will really start to pick up some\nof the bristles on the tree here.\n\n95\n00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.413\nSo you can do this.\n\n96\n00:05:37.317 --> 00:05:39.430\nAnd if we wanted to do that over here,\nwe could as well.\n\n97\n00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.450\nOkay.\n\n98\n00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.910\nNow if we want to dodge something.\n\n99\n00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.260\nSo dodging would be if\nyou wanted to lighten it.\n\n100\n00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.470\nSo if you wanted to\nlighten up this ornament,\n\n101\n00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.380\nso it's a little bit brighter, you could.\n\n102\n00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.190\nOr if you wanted to darken part\nof the image, you could as well.\n\n103\n00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.480\nSo let's just kind of click,\nhold and drag around here.\n\n104\n00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.520\nAgain, these are just really slight,\nslight changes.\n\n105\n00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.060\nThe sponge I'm not going to use,\ncuz I personally don't really like\n\n106\n00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.880\nthe effect of saturation on my photo,\nso I'm just gonna ignore that for now.\n\n107\n00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.745\nBut I do have this part of the image that\nI don't want to stand out quite as much,\n\n108\n00:06:17.745 --> 00:06:19.400\nit's this top corner.\n\n109\n00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:26.550\nSo let's go ahead and blur that out,\nso just slightly blurring.\n\n110\n00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.250\nThe other thing we could do, if we want,\n\n111\n00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.810\nis kinda smudge it out too,\nif you want so that way.\n\n112\n00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.250\nBut, smudging is kind of weird in what\nit does, so you just wanna be ever so\n\n113\n00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.950\nslight with it.\n\n114\n00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.330\nAnd don't click hold and\n\n115\n00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.540\ndrag around or else you'll get some\nkind of weird mixture of colors.\n\n116\n00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.374\nBut you can use it sparingly.\n\n117\n00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.530\n>> Very nice.\n\n118\n00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.430\nAnd it seems like even though some of\nthese effects are subtle, you start adding\n\n119\n00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.090\nup all these subtle effects, and it really\nmakes a difference in that overall image.\n\n120\n00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.870\n>> It really does.\n\n121\n00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.600\nSo those healing tools that we learned,\nyou can also use these on a face.\n\n122\n00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.166\nSo let's kind of zoom in\nto my nose a little bit.\n\n123\n00:07:12.166 --> 00:07:17.440\nLet's go Command plus, then I'm going to\nuse this blur tool on my nose ever so\n\n124\n00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.700\nslightly, cuz I actually have\nsome scar tissue on my nose.\n\n125\n00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.250\nNow it's not quite as noticeable\nbecause I just blurred it out.\n\n126\n00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.950\nAnd, really, doesn't look unnatural, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.960\nSo you'll need to play around with\nthese image correction tools.\n\n128\n00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.970\nFind out what looks more natural to you.\n\n129\n00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:39.590\nSo let's create another layer like we've\ndone before and let's add, I don't know,\n\n130\n00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.150\nlet's use a light yellow.\n\n131\n00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.920\nSo I'm gonna come over here.\n\n132\n00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.760\nWe're gonna make it look like\nwe have slight tans, so [LAUGH].\n\n133\n00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.370\nWhich is more realistic for me than\nit is for my sister, she just burns.\n\n134\n00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:57.168\nBut we're gonna pretend like she can also\nget a tan, so I'm gonna fill this in here,\n\n135\n00:07:57.168 --> 00:08:01.672\nand let's go ahead and multiply it,\nand lower the opacity some.\n\n136\n00:08:04.052 --> 00:08:09.100\nAnd there,\nnow we have slightly tanner skin.\n\n137\n00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.010\n>> Very good.\n\n138\n00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.540\n>> So, let's see our\ndifference in the images here.\n\n139\n00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.040\nI'm going to combine these two,\nLayer 1 and edited.\n\n140\n00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.735\nI'm going to drag them into their own\nfolder, I'm going to right click,\n\n141\n00:08:19.735 --> 00:08:25.820\nI'm going to merge them together so that\nway they're not separate from each other.\n\n142\n00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.631\nSo now its basically like flattening.\n\n143\n00:08:27.631 --> 00:08:28.890\nSo there's group one.\n\n144\n00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:34.980\nNow, if i hide it,\nyou'll see there's our other image.\n\n145\n00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.100\nSubtle but noticeable differences.\n\n146\n00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.080\nKeep an eye on my chin, for instance.\n\n147\n00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.430\nSo let's look at the chin in the edited.\n\n148\n00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:43.345\nAnd let's look at\nthe chin in the unedited.\n\n149\n00:08:43.345 --> 00:08:44.449\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n150\n00:08:44.449 --> 00:08:47.970\nDefinitly see that.\n\n151\n00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:48.620\n>> Yep.\n\n152\n00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:53.210\nAnd so now it's up to you to go through\nyour own pictures and really put in some\n\n153\n00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:57.920\nimage corrections and tell your friends\n[LAUGH] that you can do it for them.\n\n154\n00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.120\n>> Very good.\nAll right, Kara, we appreciate that.\n\n155\n00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.450\nAnother great one of those try it outs\nwhere we get to take what we've learned,\n\n156\n00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.760\nand put it into action.\n\n157\n00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.250\nHope everybody enjoyed\nfollowing along with that one.\n\n158\n00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.840\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n159\n00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.510\n>> And I'm Kara Page.\n\n160\n00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:14.148\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n161\n00:09:14.148 --> 00:09:17.954\n[SOUND]\n\n",
