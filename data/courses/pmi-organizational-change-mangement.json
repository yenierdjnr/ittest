00:00:13.138\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to\n\n4\n00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:15.796\nanother great episode\nright here on ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.796 --> 00:00:19.230\nYou're watching\nthe Organizational Change Management show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.680\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're gonna be focusing in on,\n\n7\n00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.530\nwell, what is change?\n\n8\n00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.502\nAnd here to help us once again,\nwell it's gonna be.\n\n9\n00:00:26.502 --> 00:00:30.350\nWell, in change management,\nour sovereign herself, is Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.110\nJo, welcome to the show.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Ronnie,\n\n11\n00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.720\nhow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fine.\n\n12\n00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.545\nSo Jo, as we begin and as we start to\ntake a look at this entire concept of.\n\n13\n00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:41.680\nOf course we know where we need to begin.\n\n14\n00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.190\nBut why is this so important?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n15\n00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.000\nthis is the first episode in a show that's\nbased on organizational change management.\n\n16\n00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.380\nBut I'm looking at this, from the\nperspective of those that are studying for\n\n17\n00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.880\ntheir PMI and for\nproject management institute.\n\n18\n00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.149\nAnd we're looking specifically at\norganisational change within projects and\n\n19\n00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.340\nportfolios and programs.\n\n20\n00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.836\nAnd so we're gonna be concentrating on\nthe effects of change and actually,\n\n21\n00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:14.360\nhow we manage change in a project\nmanagement environment.\n\n22\n00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.234\nBecause let's face it, a project\nis supposed to implement a change,\n\n23\n00:01:19.234 --> 00:01:22.350\nright?\n&gt;&gt; It is has implement a change.\n\n24\n00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.560\nSo Joe, why is it so\n\n25\n00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.760\nimportant that we're taking the time to\ntalk about the idea of change management?\n\n26\n00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.600\nI can just change something and\nit's changed,\n\n27\n00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.790\nit's done.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n28\n00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.650\nthat's a general misconception.\n\n29\n00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.190\nThat this is a problem that we\nhave within an IT perspective and\n\n30\n00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.720\nwithin a project management environment.\n\n31\n00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.877\nIs the fact that change just happens, and\nit's something that to a casual user for\n\n32\n00:01:44.877 --> 00:01:50.300\ninstance, or to somebody within IT, it\nmight even be happening in the background.\n\n33\n00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.860\nAnd they might not actually\nsee any of the mechanics.\n\n34\n00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.070\nAnd in fact, I'll be honest with you,\nfor a good change management process.\n\n35\n00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.654\nWell if you can't actually see what's\nhappening and its not hurting you,\n\n36\n00:02:03.654 --> 00:02:06.795\nthen is that a good process or\nis that a bad process?\n\n37\n00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:09.609\nBe surely things will just get better,\n\n38\n00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:11.065\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n39\n00:02:11.065 --> 00:02:14.057\nI would expect that they would get\nbetter but i guess that the problem\n\n40\n00:02:14.057 --> 00:02:16.750\nwe would have then is not knowing\nwhat the outcome should be.\n\n41\n00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.720\nBecause not every change is\na positive change, right?\n\n42\n00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.473\nYou know what?\nWe keep talking about this word, change,\n\n43\n00:02:23.473 --> 00:02:26.243\nalright.\n&gt;&gt; But I haven't really described what\n\n44\n00:02:26.243 --> 00:02:26.953\nthe change is.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n45\n00:02:26.953 --> 00:02:29.571\nwell, let's start with that.\n&gt;&gt; What do you\n\n46\n00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:32.280\nsay change is?\n&gt;&gt; Change, I think, actually is going to\n\n47\n00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.610\nbe something that is different than\nwhat I'm currently at right now.\n\n48\n00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.670\nOkay, so that's the sort of\nthe dictionary definition of the word\n\n49\n00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.920\nchange.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n50\n00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I know you're gonna be\n\n51\n00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.810\nimpressed with this one.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n52\n00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:45.950\n&gt;&gt; Because as far as\n\n53\n00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.260\nWikipedia's concerned,\n\n54\n00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.670\nthe definition of the word change is\nthe process of becoming different.\n\n55\n00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.970\nThat's what change means.\n\n56\n00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.320\nBut what does change really mean,\nto you or to you?\n\n57\n00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.100\nWhat does it really mean?\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n58\n00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.404\nthink it actually means something\nthat's different [LAUGH].\n\n59\n00:03:03.404 --> 00:03:04.180\nI don't know\n&gt;&gt; And is that it?\n\n60\n00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.510\nSee, look,\nthis is Ronnie thinking outside the box.\n\n61\n00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.916\n&gt;&gt; It is me thinking outside the box,\n\n62\n00:03:07.916 --> 00:03:08.963\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n63\n00:03:08.963 --> 00:03:11.976\nwhen most people think of the word change,\n\n64\n00:03:11.976 --> 00:03:16.240\nsurely most people think about upheaval.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n65\n00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.212\n&gt;&gt; They think about the negative aspects\n\n66\n00:03:17.212 --> 00:03:19.280\nof change.\n&gt;&gt; Sure, right, I can do that.\n\n67\n00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.250\nThey may even be looking for change but\nnevertheless, they're wary about change.\n\n68\n00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.130\nMaybe we use words like anticipation,\nwhen it comes to change.\n\n69\n00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.190\n&gt;&gt; Anxiety.\n\n70\n00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.682\n&gt;&gt; Anxiety, I like that one.\n\n71\n00:03:31.682 --> 00:03:35.190\nI mean, sometimes we think\nof change as a good thing.\n\n72\n00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.230\nBut even when we are thinking\nof change is a good thing.\n\n73\n00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.530\nWe still got to be concerned and\nwe have got to be prepared for\n\n74\n00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.280\nany of the byproducts of change.\n\n75\n00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.370\nAnd all of those feelings that we\njust talked about, anticipation and\n\n76\n00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.100\nanxiety, I like that one.\n\n77\n00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.787\nThat is byproduct of change, so\nthat means that sometimes people are,\n\n78\n00:03:55.787 --> 00:03:57.750\nwell, reluctant to change.\n\n79\n00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.080\nAre you one of these people Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; I really am.\n\n80\n00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.250\nI don't really like the idea of change,\n\n81\n00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.990\nbut I've gone through it enough\nin my life now that I accept it.\n\n82\n00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.665\nRegardless of the situation,\nwhether I think it's good or bad,\n\n83\n00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:11.940\nI just go we're gonna change.\n\n84\n00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.505\nAnd so I have now learned to say,\n\n85\n00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:19.205\nlet's just do it.\n&gt;&gt; You just said something that mades me\n\n86\n00:04:19.205 --> 00:04:22.127\nwanna cry deep down inside, and\ni just wanna mention that, right.\n\n87\n00:04:22.127 --> 00:04:22.638\nBecause what's Ronnie said,\nit breaks my little hearts to here.\n\n88\n00:04:22.638 --> 00:04:27.326\nRonnie said was regardless is\nwether it's good or bad, but\n\n89\n00:04:27.326 --> 00:04:32.732\nRonnie, change is good, right?\n&gt;&gt; I think some change can be good,\n\n90\n00:04:32.732 --> 00:04:36.230\nbut it depends on your situation\nat that point, if you.\n\n91\n00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.273\n&gt;&gt; I'm breaking inside here.\n\n92\n00:04:38.273 --> 00:04:39.384\nI am breaking inside.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n93\n00:04:39.384 --> 00:04:43.020\nI'm not going to start to tear up cuz.\n&gt;&gt; No, but I am.\n\n94\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.340\n&gt;&gt; All right, so yes.\n\n95\n00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.480\nI think that change can be good, but\nI don't think that we always see\n\n96\n00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.840\nit as being good.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's a good point.\n\n97\n00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.160\nAnd this is one of the reasons why\nwe've gotta look at change management.\n\n98\n00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.340\nWe've gotta look at\norganizational change management.\n\n99\n00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.330\nBecause, what Ronnie's describing, okay,\n\n100\n00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.870\nit makes me really sad inside.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n101\n00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.470\n&gt;&gt; And if somebody who manages change and\n\n102\n00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.440\nwho manages organizational change,\n\n103\n00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.230\nthen yeah, it does make me really,\nyou know, upset.\n\n104\n00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.725\nWhen I hear about people that don't\nwant to work and change but, you know,\n\n105\n00:05:14.725 --> 00:05:17.740\nto be perfectly honest,\nthis is the norm, this is the reality.\n\n106\n00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.351\nAnd so the art of change management;\ngood change management is\n\n107\n00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:25.831\nactually all about,\nturn and running around,\n\n108\n00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:27.360\nthat's what it is.\n&gt;&gt; [Laughter]\n\n109\n00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.925\n&gt;&gt; That is convincing Ronnie,\n\n110\n00:05:28.925 --> 00:05:30.430\nthat change is a good idea.\n\n111\n00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.481\nAnd in fact it's not even about convincing\nRonnie, it's not good enough for\n\n112\n00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:37.050\nme to convince Ronnie that\nchange is a good idea.\n\n113\n00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.750\nBecause if I'm just convincing\nRonnie that change is a good idea,\n\n114\n00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.940\nthen all I'm doing is basically dragging\nhim along kicking and screaming.\n\n115\n00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.450\nAnd let's face it, if I'm dragging\nhim along kicking and screaming,\n\n116\n00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.590\nhe's not exactly gonna be on board.\n\n117\n00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.250\nNot only is he not gonna welcome it,\nbut he's not going to embrace it and\n\n118\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.515\nhe's not going to be a champion for\nchange.\n\n119\n00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.606\nAnd all it takes is one negative voice\nout of 500 people in the office and\n\n120\n00:06:03.606 --> 00:06:05.060\nin your environment.\n\n121\n00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.016\nThat one negative voice can undermine\nthe entire positive effects of whatever\n\n122\n00:06:10.016 --> 00:06:13.635\nchange, no matter what\nthe size of that change is.\n\n123\n00:06:13.635 --> 00:06:19.145\nSo it's simply, not good enough for me to\ndrag Ronnie along kicking and screaming.\n\n124\n00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:23.095\nConvincing is not the right word,\nit's not the word I want to use.\n\n125\n00:06:23.095 --> 00:06:27.395\nWhat I want Ronnie to do is,\nI want him to embrace the change.\n\n126\n00:06:27.395 --> 00:06:30.035\nI want him to be passionate about change.\n\n127\n00:06:30.035 --> 00:06:31.755\nI want him to be enthusiastic.\n\n128\n00:06:31.755 --> 00:06:33.605\nI want him to anticipate.\n\n129\n00:06:33.605 --> 00:06:36.700\nNow, I'm gonna come onto\nthis in another episode.\n\n130\n00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.650\nWe're gonna look at risk,\n\n131\n00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.850\nbecause we have to accept that with\nany change, there is going to be risk.\n\n132\n00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.420\nAnd therefore, we've got to make sure\nthat we, well, that we manage that risk,\n\n133\n00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.870\nthat we either accept it or\nwe mitigate against the risk.\n\n134\n00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.200\nBut nevertheless, change is inevitable, so\n\n135\n00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.450\nwe have to look for\nways to embrace that change.\n\n136\n00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.484\nAnd then it's up to me then, if I'm\nmanaging the change, [LAUGH] to look for\n\n137\n00:07:02.484 --> 00:07:05.600\nways to convince Ronnie that\nit's a great idea, right?\n\n138\n00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.670\nI mean, why do we need to change?\n&gt;&gt; You're asking me, okay.\n\n139\n00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.250\nWhy do we need change?\n&gt;&gt; Well, that was a question.\n\n140\n00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.242\n&gt;&gt; All right, so yeah,\n\n141\n00:07:14.242 --> 00:07:18.220\nas we do certain things, when things\ndon't work the way that they should be.\n\n142\n00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.930\nWe should consider change as one\nof the options that we have and\n\n143\n00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:25.540\nnot just the idea of a mitigation,\nbut to improve something that we need.\n\n144\n00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.490\nSo, let's work at from standpoint that\nthere is something we need to improve, and\n\n145\n00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.145\nright now what we're doing is not working.\n\n146\n00:07:32.145 --> 00:07:37.545\nWell, the simple fact of the matter\nis that nothing stays the same.\n\n147\n00:07:37.545 --> 00:07:40.725\nIt doesn't matter whether it's, and\nI'm gonna touch on the note here,\n\n148\n00:07:40.725 --> 00:07:44.430\nit doesn't matter whether it's\nthe car that you drive [LAUGH].\n\n149\n00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.830\nWhich, in Ronnie's case has\nbeen around for a little while.\n\n150\n00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.588\n[LAUGH] It doesn't matter whether\nit's the car that you drive, or\n\n151\n00:07:50.588 --> 00:07:55.045\nwhether it's the pen that you use, or\nwhether it's the laptop that you use.\n\n152\n00:07:55.045 --> 00:07:58.507\nIt doesn't matter what it is,\nthe fact is that nothing stays the same.\n\n153\n00:07:58.507 --> 00:08:02.924\nThere is not one of us, and now I'm gonna\nto show my age now, but there's not one of\n\n154\n00:08:02.924 --> 00:08:07.224\nus that is still using the same TV\nthat we were using 30 years ago.\n\n155\n00:08:07.224 --> 00:08:09.260\n[LAUGH] No, no, no, no, no!\n\n156\n00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.560\nDon't say [CROSSTALK].\n\n157\n00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.660\nIf you could see the look on\nRonnie's face at that point in time.\n\n158\n00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.150\nNo, don't do this to me.\n\n159\n00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:21.310\nThere is not one of us that's still using\nthe same TV that we were using 30 years\n\n160\n00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.878\nago, is there, Ronnie?\n\n161\n00:08:22.878 --> 00:08:25.091\nNo.\n[LAUGH]\n\n162\n00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:25.946\n&gt;&gt; I am not gonna tell\n\n163\n00:08:25.946 --> 00:08:28.180\nyou the answer to that.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n164\n00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.065\n&gt;&gt; So it is possible.\n\n165\n00:08:29.065 --> 00:08:32.350\n[LAUGH] but-\n&gt;&gt; I have opened up a can of worms here,\n\n166\n00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.070\nI know this now.\n&gt;&gt; Well, you did wanna talk about change\n\n167\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.970\nof an address so here you go,\nyou've got the toughest case in the world.\n\n168\n00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:38.695\nThere you go.\n\n169\n00:08:38.695 --> 00:08:40.606\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Gee, thanks.\n\n170\n00:08:40.606 --> 00:08:43.532\n[LAUGH] The simple fact is that change is\n\n171\n00:08:43.532 --> 00:08:44.340\ninevitable.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n172\n00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:44.860\n&gt;&gt; It is,\n\n173\n00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.464\nhonestly it's inevitable, it really is.\n\n174\n00:08:47.464 --> 00:08:52.560\n[LAUGH] And so, when we are implementing\nchange, we have to think\n\n175\n00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.670\nabout how we can drag people,\nlike Ronnie, kicking and screaming.\n\n176\n00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.940\nI've got no other words for\nthis, I really haven't.\n\n177\n00:09:00.975 --> 00:09:05.515\nSo when we're implementing any change,\nwhether it's an organizational level\n\n178\n00:09:05.515 --> 00:09:08.615\nchange, or\nwhether it's an individual change.\n\n179\n00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:14.455\nThe simple fact is, that in order for\nan organizational change to be successful,\n\n180\n00:09:14.455 --> 00:09:18.135\nthen individuals have to get on board.\n\n181\n00:09:18.135 --> 00:09:20.405\nNow, I come from a different place\n\n182\n00:09:20.405 --> 00:09:21.165\nfrom you.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n183\n00:09:21.165 --> 00:09:21.805\n&gt;&gt; Clearly\n\n184\n00:09:21.805 --> 00:09:24.460\nwe've got a slightly different accent.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe.\n\n185\n00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.550\nJust a little bit, yeah.\n\n186\n00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.790\nAnd we've already had the discussion\nas to whether organizational should\n\n187\n00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.160\nhave a z in it or\nwhether it should have an s in it.\n\n188\n00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.090\nBut of course we know the answer, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n189\n00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:38.930\n&gt;&gt; It's an s, it's an s, but you remember,\n\n190\n00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.700\na few years ago now,\n[LAUGH] he's probably still got one.\n\n191\n00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.360\nWhenever I say, do you remember?\n\n192\n00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.930\nDo you remember Betamax and VHS videos?\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n193\n00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:50.080\n&gt;&gt; Tell me you haven't got one still.\n\n194\n00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I still have a VHS player,\n\n195\n00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.460\nyes, yes I do.\n&gt;&gt; I knew.\n\n196\n00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.040\nI knew before we even went\ninto this conversation.\n\n197\n00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:02.000\nSo at the time when VHS and\nBetamax first came out.\n\n198\n00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.600\nWhich one do you think was more popular?\n&gt;&gt; At the beginning is-\n\n199\n00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.170\n&gt;&gt; At the time?\n\n200\n00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:07.990\n&gt;&gt; At the time,\n\n201\n00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:12.840\nI would assume it was Betamax.\n&gt;&gt; Right, it was, and\n\n202\n00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.230\nyet it never took off, why?\n&gt;&gt; It was,\n\n203\n00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.270\nI knew the answer to this at one point.\n\n204\n00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.875\nI do not remember what\nthe answer is right now.\n\n205\n00:10:21.875 --> 00:10:23.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n206\n00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.400\n&gt;&gt; Well basically it was because, and\n\n207\n00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.910\nwe're gonna talk about this in other\nepisodes, but we're gonna talk\n\n208\n00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.580\nabout early adopters and we're going\nto look at the adoption of change.\n\n209\n00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.090\nAnd basically it was\nbecause the change wasn't\n\n210\n00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:34.780\nmanaged.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n211\n00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:38.700\n&gt;&gt; Eventhough it made sense for people.\n\n212\n00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.570\nThere were a number of reasons\nwhy the change wasn't managed.\n\n213\n00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:46.490\nAnd there have been alot of unsuccessful\nattempts at integrating technology\n\n214\n00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.120\ninto our lives throughout the years.\n\n215\n00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.460\nAnd for those of you that aren't\nold enough, [LAUGH] like Ronnie and\n\n216\n00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.970\nI, to remember VHS and Betamax.\n\n217\n00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.950\nThink about, do you remember the little\nminidisks that came out not long\n\n218\n00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.270\nafter they brought it to CDs?\n&gt;&gt; I do,\n\n219\n00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.410\nsure.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n220\n00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:05.310\nthere are lots of other examples\nof when this has happened.\n\n221\n00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.870\nI mean, you've only gotta think\nabout gaming consoles and\n\n222\n00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:11.420\nthe ones that have taken off and\nthe ones that kind of lasted for\n\n223\n00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:16.040\na couple of years and then just simply\ndied a death and faded into obscurity.\n\n224\n00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.020\nAnd a lot of this is about unsuccessful\n\n225\n00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.930\nchange management.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n226\n00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.460\n&gt;&gt; When you're implementing a change,\n\n227\n00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:28.630\nno matter what the change is,\nit has to deliver value to the individual.\n\n228\n00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:32.650\nAnd I mentioned the fact that,\neven at an organizational level,\n\n229\n00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:37.790\nwhen you're implementing an organizational\nchange, that's a change to everyone.\n\n230\n00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:41.230\nIt has to have a benefit\nto the individual.\n\n231\n00:11:43.814 --> 00:11:45.280\nWhy?\n&gt;&gt; If\n\n232\n00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.680\nit doesn't have a benefit to\nthe individual, the individual\n\n233\n00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.480\ndoesn't see the need to change.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n234\n00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.390\n&gt;&gt; So if the benefit seems to be\n\n235\n00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.040\nhigh enough then you're more\nthan likely to convince them or\n\n236\n00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.670\nto allow them to buy into that fact.\n\n237\n00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:02.380\nSo I'm assuming that without the value,\npeople would just say why should I?\n\n238\n00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.840\n&gt;&gt; Right, and if they say why should I?\n\n239\n00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.690\nThen it's not gonna be a success.\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n240\n00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.760\n&gt;&gt; Let's just say for instance,\n\n241\n00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:15.020\nI mean we've all got our own specific\ntype of laptop that we prefer.\n\n242\n00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.950\nAnd let's face it, a lot of it is driven\nby the fact that we've got preferences but\n\n243\n00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:23.050\nalso by the fact that\nwe've got our own skills.\n\n244\n00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:28.150\nAnd each of one of us will use\na specific operating system because\n\n245\n00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:33.470\nof the skills we're invariably sort\nof demonstrating most of the time.\n\n246\n00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:40.300\nBut what if Tim decided that there was\nsomething new out on the marketplace and\n\n247\n00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.260\nhe wanted us all to try that.\n\n248\n00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:47.100\nHow do you think we'd get along with it?\n&gt;&gt; In this company we'd get along very\n\n249\n00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.840\nwell because it's happened.\n&gt;&gt; You\n\n250\n00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.970\nthink?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n251\n00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.030\nyes, I do.\n\n252\n00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.050\nIn this company,\nwe have always done that, in that sense,\n\n253\n00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:59.990\nwhere that is part of the culture we have,\nwhich is the idea of change.\n\n254\n00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:03.010\nSo if something new comes along,\nwe are probably going to change.\n\n255\n00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.287\nWe like being on what we call\nthe bleeding edge of technology.\n\n256\n00:13:06.287 --> 00:13:08.620\nNot leading it.\n&gt;&gt; Not just the cutting edge.\n\n257\n00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not leading it, not cutting edge.\n\n258\n00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:14.410\nWe are on the bleeding edge\nof technology is the phrase,\n\n259\n00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:20.040\nthat our Tim has actually said before.\n&gt;&gt; Don't you think that's common?\n\n260\n00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.950\n&gt;&gt; No I don't think that's common at all.\n\n261\n00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.510\nBut I do think that at least for\nwhat we've done so\n\n262\n00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.170\nfar, is that we've willingly and\neasily adopted\n\n263\n00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:32.473\nwhen changes have come along.\n&gt;&gt; I used a lot of negative words a little\n\n264\n00:13:32.473 --> 00:13:33.349\nearlier on and\n\n265\n00:13:33.349 --> 00:13:38.323\nactually Ronnie was the one that was quite\npositive when we talked about change.\n\n266\n00:13:38.323 --> 00:13:42.200\nAnd Ronnie was talking about sorta\nof excitement and changes and\n\n267\n00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.710\nthings happening.\n\n268\n00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:48.210\nAnd something new happening, a move\nfrom a current state, to a new state.\n\n269\n00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.740\nAnd I'm the one that mentions\nwords like upheaval, and\n\n270\n00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.120\nI mention sort of anticipation.\n\n271\n00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.674\nAnd I wanna bring in things like\nthe missed setting of expectations, for\n\n272\n00:13:58.674 --> 00:13:59.445\ninstance.\n\n273\n00:13:59.445 --> 00:14:04.630\nIf expectations only set, then again\nthere's a negative connotation, and\n\n274\n00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:08.670\na I want to do that\nbecause I want to bring in\n\n275\n00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.960\nsome of what happens in the real world.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n276\n00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.610\n&gt;&gt; Because upheavel is something that's\n\n277\n00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.620\nalways considered when we're\nbringing in anything new.\n\n278\n00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.930\nAny new technology.\n\n279\n00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.230\nAnd the one that I absolutely hate\n\n280\n00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.580\nbecause we've always done it this way.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n281\n00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.430\n&gt;&gt; And in fact, not all that long ago I\n\n282\n00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:32.430\nwas actually on-site with a client and\none of their biggest, how should I say,\n\n283\n00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.240\nit's not a driver but\nit was more resistance.\n\n284\n00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.080\nOne of the phrases that\nI heard the most was\n\n285\n00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.890\nbecause we've always done it like this.\n\n286\n00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.430\nThat's what we would consider to\nbe active resistance to change.\n\n287\n00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.400\nAnd then we've also got\npassive resistance to change.\n\n288\n00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.420\nWhich of the people that look\non the most part to be all for\n\n289\n00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.780\nthe change but\nthen don't want to embrace the change.\n\n290\n00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.020\nyeah, that sounds like a great idea but\nnow, I'm just gonna leave this room and\n\n291\n00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.500\ncarry on doing whatever it is that\nI was doing in the first place.\n\n292\n00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.400\nBecause I really don't like it and\nI'm not on board.\n\n293\n00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:12.430\nIf we cannot meet the individual, when it\ncomes to organizational change management,\n\n294\n00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:16.270\nif we cannot answer the question,\nwhat's in it for me?\n\n295\n00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:20.920\nAnd we cannot deliver\nbenefit to the individual,\n\n296\n00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.970\nthen change management at an organization\nlevel just, well, it will be unsuccessful.\n\n297\n00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.730\nWe will not be able to implement\nchange at an organizational level.\n\n298\n00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:35.920\nAnd as I've said, it only takes one\nnegative person to undermine 500 or 1000\n\n299\n00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:41.670\npeople within an organization, depending\non who it is that's being negative.\n\n300\n00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.940\nLet me give you an example.\n\n301\n00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:50.149\nSo an organization that I have\nspent a lot of time with.\n\n302\n00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:56.646\nThey have one person on their board,\non their steering group,\n\n303\n00:15:56.646 --> 00:16:02.419\non their IT board,\nwho is very much against any change.\n\n304\n00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:06.003\nEverybody else on the board\nis completely for the change,\n\n305\n00:16:06.003 --> 00:16:07.840\nwhatever that change may be.\n\n306\n00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.890\nMaybe it be implementing a new process,\nmaybe it be implementing a new service.\n\n307\n00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.330\nBut, essentially, this one person,\n\n308\n00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.950\nwhatever is suggested at\ntheir board meetings,\n\n309\n00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:21.190\nat their steering group meetings,\nis always shot down by this one person.\n\n310\n00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.870\nWhat do you think that organization\nlooks like to the average person,\n\n311\n00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.170\nto the help desk analyst, for instance?\n\n312\n00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.030\nWhat do you think that they\nthink of their IT organization?\n\n313\n00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.718\n&gt;&gt; They're probably thinking that it's\n\n314\n00:16:34.718 --> 00:16:38.404\nstaid, or it's old in that sense, and\n\n315\n00:16:38.404 --> 00:16:42.584\nit's resistant to any change at all.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n316\n00:16:42.584 --> 00:16:44.564\nthat only scrapes the surface.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n317\n00:16:44.564 --> 00:16:45.362\nthere you go [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Just about.\n\n318\n00:16:45.362 --> 00:16:51.096\nWhat they're actually thinking, right now,\nis they're sitting at their desks thinking\n\n319\n00:16:51.096 --> 00:16:54.330\nthat none of their processes work.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n320\n00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.630\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because nobody has helped them\n\n321\n00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.390\nto implement new processes.\n\n322\n00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:03.660\nBecause they can't get a decision up here\nas to what these new processes should look\n\n323\n00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.350\nlike, so nothing's been done.\n\n324\n00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.950\nThey're thinking that their\ntechnology doesn't work.\n\n325\n00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.440\nAnd why?\n\n326\n00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.260\nBecause we haven't brought in any new\ntechnology for a long, long time because\n\n327\n00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:19.740\nsomebody up here keeps vetoing\nthe decision to bring in new technology.\n\n328\n00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:26.660\nThey're thinking that the functional\ndirection of the team, the strategy,\n\n329\n00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:31.590\nwho they're working with and how they're\nworking, that's not working either.\n\n330\n00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:36.080\nBecause somebody up here is being\nresistant to implementing new ways of\n\n331\n00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.600\nworking and to implementing\na new functional structure.\n\n332\n00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.680\nSo, actually,\nthe reality on the average person,\n\n333\n00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.890\nthat person that's sitting on\nthe help desk, the reality is,\n\n334\n00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:52.710\nnot just that there's a little bit of\ndysfunction at the leadership level.\n\n335\n00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.790\nBut, actually,\nthat they can not do their job.\n\n336\n00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.670\nThat's one person.\n\n337\n00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:04.010\nNow you multiply that by a thousand\npeople that we have within IT, and\n\n338\n00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:09.620\nyou can imagine that there are a thousand\npeople that do not have a clear direction.\n\n339\n00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:14.220\nThere are a thousand people\nthat are not necessarily\n\n340\n00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.350\nclear on their ways of working.\n\n341\n00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.250\nAnd then what happens when\nconfrontation arises?\n\n342\n00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:24.170\nWhat happens when there is a conflict?\n&gt;&gt; I'm assuming that it\n\n343\n00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.910\nactually really blogs down even more.\n\n344\n00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:31.400\nAnd the idea of individuals being able to\n\n345\n00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:36.500\nexpress what they choose to, either they\nget very frustrated by that expression or\n\n346\n00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.490\nthey choose not to engage at all.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n347\n00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:40.800\nthey choose not to engage at all.\n\n348\n00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.330\nAnd this is what happens right now is\nthat individual people are choosing not\n\n349\n00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:46.459\nto engage at all.\n\n350\n00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:51.910\nAll because we've got one person\nthat's resistant to change.\n\n351\n00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:55.260\nAnd because one person is, well,\n\n352\n00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:00.210\nthey have an influence over whether\nchange happens within that organization.\n\n353\n00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.310\nNow, I'm not saying that all\nchange is a good thing, and\n\n354\n00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.270\nI'm not saying that all\nchange is a bad thing.\n\n355\n00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.959\nBut what I'm saying is that\nchange has to be managed.\n\n356\n00:19:08.959 --> 00:19:09.958\nAnd we're going to go through.\n\n357\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:15.179\nAs we go through these various episodes,\nwe're going to go through various\n\n358\n00:19:15.179 --> 00:19:19.991\ntechniques that we will want to implement\nand we will want to use when we\n\n359\n00:19:19.991 --> 00:19:25.150\nare managing change at both project,\nand program, and portfolio level.\n\n360\n00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.070\nEverything that we do is to make a change.\n\n361\n00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.120\nEverything that we do is\nto make an improvement.\n\n362\n00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:36.540\nEvery single action that we do within IT,\nno matter what it is, is to improve.\n\n363\n00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.460\nIt's never to make things worse.\n\n364\n00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.120\nEvery decision that we make is to improve.\n\n365\n00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.690\nAnd that's all change, so\neverything that we do is to make a change.\n\n366\n00:19:46.878 --> 00:19:51.670\nSo on the slide that's coming up in front\nof you right now, you'll see that the PMI,\n\n367\n00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:55.830\nthe Project Management Institute,\ndefines change as a comprehensive,\n\n368\n00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.650\ncyclic, and structured approach.\n\n369\n00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:02.610\nIt's about transitioning individuals,\nas we've already mentioned, and groups,\n\n370\n00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:07.650\nand organizations from where we\nare right now to where we want to be.\n\n371\n00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:10.450\nAnd it's about demonstrating the benefits.\n\n372\n00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:15.210\nIt mentions business benefits here,\nbut I'll be perfectly honest with you.\n\n373\n00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:19.630\nI wanna focus on more than just business\nbenefits because I wanna focus on benefits\n\n374\n00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:20.728\nto the individual.\n\n375\n00:20:20.728 --> 00:20:23.567\nYou're not going to get\nbusiness benefits if\n\n376\n00:20:23.567 --> 00:20:26.640\nyou cannot provide benefits\nto the individual.\n\n377\n00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.336\nBecause, as we've seen,\n\n378\n00:20:28.336 --> 00:20:32.780\nif the individual's not on board\nthen the whole change is undermined.\n\n379\n00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.640\nAnd change involves.\n\n380\n00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.887\nWhen we talk about a transformational\nlevel in an organizational level,\n\n381\n00:20:41.887 --> 00:20:45.570\na level change involves the processes,\nthe people,\n\n382\n00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.770\nthe structures, the culture,\nand the strategy.\n\n383\n00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:54.290\nAnd culture is in there because\nit is incredibly important.\n\n384\n00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:58.290\nBecause, you see,\nwithout that cultural aspect, and\n\n385\n00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:02.040\nwithout us looking at attitudes, and\nwithout us looking at the impact to\n\n386\n00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:06.380\nthe individual then, quite simply, whether\nwe're trying to change a process or\n\n387\n00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:10.660\nwhether we're trying to change technology,\nit is not going to work.\n\n388\n00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:16.710\nWe've got some external drivers here\nwhich I'll show you on the next screen.\n\n389\n00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:21.470\nBut we'll need to look at this on sort of\nthe full page, as it were, because, yeah,\n\n390\n00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.710\nwe're losing that bottom corner.\n\n391\n00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:29.764\nBut if we take a look at this,\nall of these are drivers to change.\n\n392\n00:21:29.764 --> 00:21:32.037\nAll of these influence change.\n\n393\n00:21:33.344 --> 00:21:36.619\nBut unless we can convince the individual,\n\n394\n00:21:36.619 --> 00:21:41.576\nunless we can convince our team,\nthat actually these are, well,\n\n395\n00:21:41.576 --> 00:21:46.680\nrelevant to them,\nthen change is not going to be successful.\n\n396\n00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.295\nWhether it's legal and regulatory change,\nand I'm looking at that very bottom\n\n397\n00:21:50.295 --> 00:21:53.500\nright-hand corner, there's not a lot\nyou can do about legal change.\n\n398\n00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.050\nBut nevertheless,\nif I want to do something or\n\n399\n00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:01.770\nif need to do something, you're gonna have\nto convince me that it's a good idea.\n\n400\n00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.174\nSo I've got one more thing that\nI need to say, really, for\n\n401\n00:22:04.174 --> 00:22:05.610\nthis particular episode anyway.\n\n402\n00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:12.215\nBecause when we come back, we're going\nto look at who's involved in change and\n\n403\n00:22:12.215 --> 00:22:17.760\nwho's actually going to lead\nchange throughout organizations.\n\n404\n00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.940\nBut, remember,\nchange is not a one-off thing.\n\n405\n00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:23.153\nThat's the thing that I really want you\nto go away with here is that change is\n\n406\n00:22:23.153 --> 00:22:23.770\ninevitable.\n\n407\n00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:25.950\nChange is gonna happen.\n\n408\n00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.640\nChange is there to make life better.\n\n409\n00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.350\nAnd change affects everybody.\n\n410\n00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.020\nBut change is not a one-off thing.\n\n411\n00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.170\nAnd this is something that is brought\ninto mind when you're looking at service\n\n412\n00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:41.040\nmanagement, whether you're\nlooking at project management,\n\n413\n00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.670\nis that everything that we do, and\nI've already said this, is to improve.\n\n414\n00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:48.290\nBut that improvement has a short lifespan.\n\n415\n00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:51.780\nI mean, it wasn't all that long ago, or\n\n416\n00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.930\nit doesn't feel all that long ago,\nthat Ronnie got a new cell phone.\n\n417\n00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.274\nRonnie, you got a new cell phone?\n&gt;&gt; I did,\n\n418\n00:22:57.274 --> 00:23:00.061\nI moved up to a Jitterbug.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n419\n00:23:00.061 --> 00:23:00.599\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n420\n00:23:00.599 --> 00:23:02.751\n&gt;&gt; You got another one already.\n\n421\n00:23:02.751 --> 00:23:03.366\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n422\n00:23:03.366 --> 00:23:05.155\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, see because, you see,\n\n423\n00:23:05.155 --> 00:23:10.680\nan improvement only has a short life span.\n\n424\n00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.640\nAnd we think of a change\nas an improvement.\n\n425\n00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.570\nThat's what it needs to be.\n\n426\n00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:18.340\nBut, ultimately,\nI'm improving on my previous situation.\n\n427\n00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:22.880\nAnd eventually, though,\nI'm going to want to improve again.\n\n428\n00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.160\nI'm going to want to change again.\n\n429\n00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.972\nSo there's a couple of things\nthat we need to learn from that.\n\n430\n00:23:27.972 --> 00:23:31.820\nOne, that change, as I've already said,\nis not a one-off thing.\n\n431\n00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:35.770\nSo we have to embrace change.\n\n432\n00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:39.223\nWe have to establish a culture of change.\n\n433\n00:23:39.223 --> 00:23:42.675\nYou might wanna call that\ncontinual improvement, but\n\n434\n00:23:42.675 --> 00:23:46.210\nthat's a culture of change and\na culture of improving.\n\n435\n00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.985\nBut the other thing that I want you to\ntake away from this particular episode is\n\n436\n00:23:49.985 --> 00:23:52.710\nthe fact that change has gotta be managed.\n\n437\n00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:57.170\nAnd if you are creating a new process for\n\n438\n00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:02.680\nchange every time you wanna implement\nchange, it's not particularly efficient.\n\n439\n00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:11.340\nAnd what you need to have is a process for\nchange management that you can use.\n\n440\n00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.120\nOkay, maybe with some modifications, but\n\n441\n00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:19.360\nthat you can use efficiently\nwith every new change.\n\n442\n00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:25.030\nI know some people might refer to\nthat as being agile in concept.\n\n443\n00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.650\nAnd that's exactly what it is.\n\n444\n00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:27.830\nIt's an agile approach.\n\n445\n00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:29.790\nIt's a continual improvement,\n\n446\n00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:34.700\na continual iteration approach to change\nmanagement, and an acknowledgement of\n\n447\n00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.510\nthe fact that change doesn't just\ncome along once every five years.\n\n448\n00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:41.420\nChange is something that we have\nto embrace on a continual basis.\n\n449\n00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:46.840\nSo when we come back, in our next episode,\nwhat we're going to do is we're going to\n\n450\n00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.920\ntake a look at the roles that there are\nwithin organizational change management,\n\n451\n00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.770\nand who we need to actually\nhelp facilitate change.\n\n452\n00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.558\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well thank you again for\n\n453\n00:24:58.558 --> 00:25:01.292\nhelping us understand some of\nthese concepts that we've been\n\n454\n00:25:01.292 --> 00:25:03.724\ntalking about in organizational\nchange management.\n\n455\n00:25:03.724 --> 00:25:07.518\nRemember, that we began with just\ntalking about why there is change or\n\n456\n00:25:07.518 --> 00:25:08.432\nwhat is change?\n\n457\n00:25:08.432 --> 00:25:11.369\nAnd so Jo helped us to define that and\ndescribe that.\n\n458\n00:25:11.369 --> 00:25:15.250\nAnd we've discussed a little bit about the\nresistance to change that's out there, and\n\n459\n00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:18.560\nthe importance of the buy-in\nfrom every person that we can.\n\n460\n00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.600\nAnd that's what organizational change\nmanagement is going to also help us to do.\n\n461\n00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.960\nSo now it means that we need to move\nforward into the concept and understand\n\n462\n00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.610\na little bit more about how do we drive\nit and who actually drives that for us.\n\n463\n00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:32.450\nAnd that's what we'll be seeing\nin other episodes in the future.\n\n464\n00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.590\nThis is a great place for\nus to go and end this episode then.\n\n465\n00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:39.550\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n466\n00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:40.550\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n467\n00:25:40.550 -->

00:00:12.420\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.090\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV,\n\n5\n00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.140\nyou're watching\nthe Organizational Change Management show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.880\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're gonna be discussing roles and\n\n7\n00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.740\nactivities as we continue\nthrough the series.\n\n8\n00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.116\nAnd here of course to help us out is the\norganizational change baroness herself,\n\n9\n00:00:30.116 --> 00:00:33.000\nMiss Jo Peacock, Jo, welcome to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.697\n&gt;&gt; I'm concerned actually Ronnie-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]-\n\n11\n00:00:34.697 --> 00:00:35.796\n&gt;&gt; Did you say baroness or bareness?\n\n12\n00:00:35.796 --> 00:00:36.612\n&gt;&gt; Baroness.\n\n13\n00:00:36.612 --> 00:00:39.926\n&gt;&gt; Because it sounded a bit like bareness\nto me and that's a little bit worrying.\n\n14\n00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:41.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, baroness.\n\n15\n00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.100\n&gt;&gt; I just, I thought he may have\nbeen peeking over my fence.\n\n16\n00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.004\n&gt;&gt; No, no, nope, nope, nope, not me.\n\n17\n00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so here we go Jo.\n\n18\n00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.050\nWe are now taking a look at the idea.\n\n19\n00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.900\nWe had kind of teased this a little\nbit in the previous episode.\n\n20\n00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.735\nWe need to talk about change management\nfrom the perspective of whose pushing it?\n\n21\n00:00:57.735 --> 00:00:59.198\nOr I shouldn't say,\nthat's probably not the right word, is it?\n\n22\n00:00:59.198 --> 00:01:02.645\nWhose leading this idea of\nchange management for us?\n\n23\n00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:03.985\nSo, Jo, help us out here.\n\n24\n00:01:03.985 --> 00:01:06.314\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah,\nI'm going to help, definitely.\n\n25\n00:01:06.314 --> 00:01:09.259\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Because if we're in the realms\n\n26\n00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:10.862\nof somebody pushing change,\n\n27\n00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:15.110\nthen I can tell you now that that\nchange is not going to be successful.\n\n28\n00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.790\nThat's exactly what we don't want.\n\n29\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.737\nAnd I know we talked a little bit in a\nprevious episode about the fact that it's\n\n30\n00:01:20.737 --> 00:01:24.703\nnot just good enough to drag Ronnie\nkicking and screaming along with change.\n\n31\n00:01:24.703 --> 00:01:30.330\nWe've got to, well, not just convince him,\nwe have got to enable him,\n\n32\n00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.560\nfacilitate his understanding\nthat change is a good thing.\n\n33\n00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.260\nSo there are lots of people involved\nin organizational change management.\n\n34\n00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.910\nIf we are making a change at\norganizational level, if we are bringing\n\n35\n00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.210\nin a new project, and we're bringing in a\nnew service that's going to involve change\n\n36\n00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.240\nat organizational level,\nthen we need to lead that change.\n\n37\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.530\nAnd we need to have a group of people\non board that is going to help us\n\n38\n00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.160\nfacilitate that change.\n\n39\n00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.110\nThen like I said, it's not just about\nconvincing people that it's a great\n\n40\n00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.550\nidea because convincing\nthem is not enough.\n\n41\n00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.560\nWe need to have people brought in.\n\n42\n00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.280\nWe need to have people\nwilling to drive change and\n\n43\n00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.930\nnot people that are just willing to\nsort of come along for the ride.\n\n44\n00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.320\nSo we're thinking about what's\ninvolved in the project, and so\n\n45\n00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.090\nwe're gonna use some PMI, Project\nManagement Institute guidelines here.\n\n46\n00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.030\nAnd let's take a look at the activities or\nrather the roles that we have\n\n47\n00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.000\nwithin our PMI organizational\nchange project.\n\n48\n00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.430\nAnd so you can see on the screen in front\nof you now that we have got a number\n\n49\n00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.690\nof roles.\n\n50\n00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.900\nWe've got our governance board and\nour sponsor.\n\n51\n00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.020\nAnd then underneath that, we've got our\nintegrators, our agents, our recipients,\n\n52\n00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.360\nand our leads.\n\n53\n00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.115\nWhy do you think they're in blue, Ronnie?\n\n54\n00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.719\n&gt;&gt; They're at a different\nlevel than the other ones.\n\n55\n00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:56.638\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n56\n00:02:56.638 --> 00:02:57.244\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n57\n00:02:57.244 --> 00:02:59.107\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n58\n00:02:59.107 --> 00:03:00.827\n&gt;&gt; That's the only thing\nI can [CROSSTALK].\n\n59\n00:03:00.827 --> 00:03:01.920\n&gt;&gt; Going for the obvious.\n\n60\n00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.465\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n61\n00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:04.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not dumb.\n\n62\n00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.700\nI went for the honors there.\n\n63\n00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.200\nAnd the very fact that they are at\nthe higher level in that chart\n\n64\n00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.650\nthat you have there seems to mean that\nthey're probably decision makers?\n\n65\n00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're decision makers, and\n\n66\n00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.280\nactually they're less\nlikely to be the doers.\n\n67\n00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n68\n00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.930\n&gt;&gt; And so that's the reason why.\n\n69\n00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.970\nBut you're completely right, they are\nthe people that are at the senior level.\n\n70\n00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.170\nThey're the people that are going\nto be leading the change.\n\n71\n00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.210\nThese are the people that are going to be,\nyou might want to consider them to be\n\n72\n00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.930\nthe figureheads as opposed to the people\nthat are actually doing the change.\n\n73\n00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.950\nI wanna take a look at\nthe top two first of all.\n\n74\n00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.888\nThink about governance boards.\n\n75\n00:03:42.888 --> 00:03:46.270\nSo who do you think should be\non the governance board, then?\n\n76\n00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.060\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jo,\nwhen it comes to the governance board,\n\n77\n00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.340\nI would assume the project manager would\nprobably be on the governance board and\n\n78\n00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.500\nthen senior managers of some sort?\n\n79\n00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.590\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Is who I would assume.\n\n80\n00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.688\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but then I kind of just asked\nyou who the senior managers are?\n\n81\n00:04:02.688 --> 00:04:05.039\n&gt;&gt; The senior managers-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n82\n00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.566\n&gt;&gt; Who they are?\n\n83\n00:04:05.566 --> 00:04:09.940\nThey would be department\nheads of some sort.\n\n84\n00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.650\nPeople in the organization\nthat might lead,\n\n85\n00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.780\nmaybe possibly even C level executives.\n\n86\n00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.872\n&gt;&gt; Right, and the reason why I ask, and\nit's not because I'm trying to be mean,\n\n87\n00:04:19.872 --> 00:04:23.445\nI mean I can be, but\nit's not because I'm trying to be mean.\n\n88\n00:04:23.445 --> 00:04:26.990\nIt's just that at some point in time,\nespecially if you're going through any\n\n89\n00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.238\nsort of accreditation, these are the sort\nof questions that you need to consider.\n\n90\n00:04:30.238 --> 00:04:31.961\nAnd so it's not just enough to say,\n\n91\n00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:35.243\nwell, the governance board are gonna\nbe those people that govern.\n\n92\n00:04:35.243 --> 00:04:39.493\nThat sounds to me to be the obvious\nanswer, but the people that govern may be\n\n93\n00:04:39.493 --> 00:04:44.120\ndifferent dependent on the project\nthat you're trying to implement.\n\n94\n00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.250\nSo the people who govern are the people\nthat make the decisions.\n\n95\n00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.650\nAnd that's what I like to call them,\nthe decision makers.\n\n96\n00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.720\nSo we're gonna have somebody that's\ngot well, that's got the money.\n\n97\n00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.270\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n98\n00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, somebody who's\nmaking a financial decision.\n\n99\n00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.750\nNow that might be your CFO,\nyour chief financial officer or\n\n100\n00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.410\nyour finance director or VP,\nvice president for instance.\n\n101\n00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.750\nIt's somebody who's got the money.\n\n102\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.430\nNow sometimes a customer, a business unit,\nthey'll quite often have money and\n\n103\n00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.850\nthey might be asking for\nsomething specific.\n\n104\n00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.260\nOr maybe it's something that happens at\nsort of senior executive board level,\n\n105\n00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.440\ndepending on the scale of the project.\n\n106\n00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.240\nSo again, I'd expect to see\nsomebody with some financial\n\n107\n00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.800\nresponsibility on the governance board.\n\n108\n00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.250\nI also expect to see somebody with\nsome technical responsibility on\n\n109\n00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.140\nthe governance board.\n\n110\n00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.610\nSomebody who sets the strategy for\n\n111\n00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.440\nIT, that strategy being for instance,\n\n112\n00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.260\nwhether we are moving to a Mac\nenvironment from a Windows environment or\n\n113\n00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.310\nwhether we are remaining\nwith a Wndows environment.\n\n114\n00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:56.470\nI think of one organization who their\nmajor project, and their major,\n\n115\n00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.600\nwell, it was a transformational project,\nwas to move from a Window's based\n\n116\n00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.865\nnetwork in a Window's based organization\nto an entirely Mac based organization.\n\n117\n00:06:07.865 --> 00:06:10.785\nSo there has to be somebody on that\ngovernance board that's gonna say, yes,\n\n118\n00:06:10.785 --> 00:06:13.175\nthis is feasible, or no, this isn't.\n\n119\n00:06:13.175 --> 00:06:17.575\nEspecially, when you're talking about\na project that has that many implications,\n\n120\n00:06:17.575 --> 00:06:19.265\nand has that bigger impact.\n\n121\n00:06:19.265 --> 00:06:21.450\nAnd that's what we're talking about here.\n\n122\n00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.820\nSo I'd expect to see\nsomebody with finance,\n\n123\n00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.780\nI'd expect to see somebody\nfrom a strategy perspective.\n\n124\n00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.820\nI'd also expect to see, in conjunction\nwith the strategy, I mentioned technical\n\n125\n00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:38.360\nability, somebody who can actually say\nwhether it's physically possible or not.\n\n126\n00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.590\nBecause it's not always,\nwhen it comes to technicalities,\n\n127\n00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.840\nit's not just about what the strategy for\nIT is,\n\n128\n00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.640\nbut it's also about the fact that,\nwell, it needs to be possible.\n\n129\n00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.970\nBecause sometimes the environment that\nwe have right now doesn't allow for\n\n130\n00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.510\ncertain changes to happen,\n\n131\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.320\nand so we have to consider whether\nit's technically feasible.\n\n132\n00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:02.100\nYes, we want the user, or\nat least the customer, the person\n\n133\n00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.420\nthat has influence over whether the money\nis spent from the business perspective.\n\n134\n00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.490\nSo that would be the requester.\n\n135\n00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.460\nI expect them to be on\nthe governance board.\n\n136\n00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.740\nAt some point in time during that change\nand by the way, the governance board is\n\n137\n00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.930\nnot just a one-off thing that says yes,\ngo ahead and then that's it, walks away.\n\n138\n00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.820\nThe governance board is\na group of people who will\n\n139\n00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.570\nrequire updates to the project\non regular intervals.\n\n140\n00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.950\nSo there may be a change of direction\nat some point in time in the future.\n\n141\n00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.380\nSo the governance board will\nmake decisions on that.\n\n142\n00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.990\nSo I'm expecting somebody from\nthe customer environment to be there.\n\n143\n00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.040\nI am expecting the project\nmanager to be there, yes.\n\n144\n00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.530\nBecause the project manager is obviously\nthe person that's going to manage this.\n\n145\n00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.550\nAnd therefore, the project manager,\nor maybe the portfolio manager, or\n\n146\n00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.000\nprogram manager,\ndepending on the scale, that particular\n\n147\n00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.270\nperson is going to be the one that\nis responsible for timelines.\n\n148\n00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:02.810\nThey're gonna be the person that's\nresponsible for the actual project itself.\n\n149\n00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.550\nI also expect that\n\n150\n00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:12.360\nyou will have somebody from a support\nenvironment on that governance board too.\n\n151\n00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.275\nOne of things that we tend to\nforget in project management,\n\n152\n00:08:17.275 --> 00:08:20.560\nalthough we tend to presume\nis going to happen seamlessly\n\n153\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.580\nin project management is that\nwhen we implement a change,\n\n154\n00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:28.570\nwhen we implement something new that we\nsimply hand over to a support operation.\n\n155\n00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.160\nAnd then that's it,\neverything's gonna work absolutely great.\n\n156\n00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:31.714\nWell, that's not the case.\n\n157\n00:08:31.714 --> 00:08:37.040\nWe want to encourage a DevOps environment.\n\n158\n00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.540\nWe want to encourage synergy\nbetween project management and\n\n159\n00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.350\nsupport environments in our\nbusiness as usual environments.\n\n160\n00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:49.340\nIf we're implementing change,\nthe only person that's really going to\n\n161\n00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.920\nunderstand the level of impact is\nsomebody from that support environment.\n\n162\n00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:59.750\nBecause they're gonna understand how the\ncustomers and the users, use the service,\n\n163\n00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04.750\nand use the IT or technology right now.\n\n164\n00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:10.869\nSo they are truly going to understand\nhow it's going to affect the users.\n\n165\n00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:16.040\nSo it's really important that somebody\nin the support environment to be there.\n\n166\n00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.130\nThey're also the ones that are gonna\ntake all of the calls and potentially,\n\n167\n00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.920\nall of the flag if something\ngoes wrong in that change.\n\n168\n00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.969\nCuz let's face it, we're in IT and\nnot everything goes smoothly.\n\n169\n00:09:26.969 --> 00:09:31.779\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then we've also got somebody in,\n\n170\n00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:37.070\nanother person in the blue here, and\nthat was somebody called the sponsor.\n\n171\n00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.810\nWhat's the difference between\nthe governance board and the sponsor?\n\n172\n00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:43.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Of course, [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know,\n\n173\n00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.420\nof course I'm gonna trick you up, right?\n\n174\n00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.150\nI'm gonna try and trick you.\n\n175\n00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:52.110\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, and you'll have to\ncorrect me, cuz I may get this one wrong.\n\n176\n00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:56.480\nWhen we talk about the idea of the\ngovernance board and all of those people\n\n177\n00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:01.130\nthat make those decisions, the sponsor\nnormally is someone that can secure and\n\n178\n00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:06.400\nalso promote the actual project itself\nthat we need, and the change that's there.\n\n179\n00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.830\nSo they might be securing funding for us.\n\n180\n00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:13.370\nOr they might be encouraging,\ngetting everybody else on board for\n\n181\n00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.360\nthe decisions that need to be made, and\n\n182\n00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.770\nsaying do we have that guarantee\nthat this is gonna be done?\n\n183\n00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.578\n&gt;&gt; I like to think of\na sponsor as a driver.\n\n184\n00:10:21.578 --> 00:10:26.560\nYeah, it's a person that is going to be,\nas you say, get in all of the support and\n\n185\n00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.100\nget in all of the commitment\nfrom everybody.\n\n186\n00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.780\nSo it's going to be a figurehead.\n\n187\n00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.230\nI like the use of the word driver and\n\n188\n00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.670\nI like the use of the word\nfigurehead as well.\n\n189\n00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.290\nThat's who a sponsor is.\n\n190\n00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:43.120\nNow the sponsor's not necessarily\nthe project manager, because the project\n\n191\n00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:48.520\nmanager is somebody who is doing, whereas\na sponsor, as I've said, is a figure head.\n\n192\n00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:55.100\nSo I expect a sponsor to be driving,\nI expect them to be visible.\n\n193\n00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.800\nI don't expect a sponsor to\nkind of sit in the background.\n\n194\n00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.000\nI also don't expect a sponsor\nto make one sort of\n\n195\n00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.490\npress statement right at the very\nbeginning of a project and\n\n196\n00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.520\nthen disappear into obscurity for\nthe duration of the project.\n\n197\n00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.810\nA sponsor is somebody who should\nbe visible throughout the project.\n\n198\n00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:19.250\nBecause a sponsor is somebody who should\n\n199\n00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.930\nensure commitment from everyone\nelse on the governance board.\n\n200\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:27.010\nBut a sponsor is also somebody who should\nensure commitment from everybody else and\n\n201\n00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.570\nthe project management team as well.\n\n202\n00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.833\nThey're there and they're driving this.\n\n203\n00:11:31.833 --> 00:11:35.896\nThey're not necessarily doing any\nof the work but they're driving and\n\n204\n00:11:35.896 --> 00:11:38.380\nthey're ensuring commitment.\n\n205\n00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:42.372\nSo we talked about our blue people\nas being those senior levels of,\n\n206\n00:11:42.372 --> 00:11:46.948\nwell, the senior levels of governance,\nthe senior levels of the project.\n\n207\n00:11:46.948 --> 00:11:51.289\nAnd you'll see we've got four up\nthere on the screen, the integrators,\n\n208\n00:11:51.289 --> 00:11:54.560\nthe agents, the recipients and the leads.\n\n209\n00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.730\nWell, these are the people that\nare actually doing the work.\n\n210\n00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.260\nSo we've got some nice\nlong words there but\n\n211\n00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.520\nlet's take a look at what those\nwords really, really mean here.\n\n212\n00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.640\nOkay, the integrators.\n\n213\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.070\nAn integrator to a project,\n\n214\n00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:14.000\nthat's the person who is\nactually effecting the change.\n\n215\n00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.120\nSo that is somebody who\nis driving the change.\n\n216\n00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.750\nIt might be the project manager,\nit is somebody who is actually\n\n217\n00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.550\nimplementing that change,\nso that's the integrator.\n\n218\n00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:30.113\nSo somebody who is considering how that\nchange is going to affect all the people,\n\n219\n00:12:30.113 --> 00:12:33.201\nsomebody who is doing\nthe communication for a change,\n\n220\n00:12:33.201 --> 00:12:36.511\nsomebody who is actually going\nto implement that change.\n\n221\n00:12:36.511 --> 00:12:42.770\nAnd somebody who maybe training people\non certain aspects of the change.\n\n222\n00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.640\nSo these are what we call our integrators.\n\n223\n00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.640\nAnd then we have an interesting word.\n\n224\n00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.550\nAnd our interesting word there is agent.\n\n225\n00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.120\nDo you have any idea what an agent is?\n\n226\n00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.080\n&gt;&gt; I do not in this context.\n\n227\n00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.003\nNo, I don't.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n228\n00:12:56.003 --> 00:12:59.340\nwe might think of the term early adopter.\n\n229\n00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, I know that term.\n\n230\n00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.350\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay,\nan early adopter is somebody like me.\n\n231\n00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:09.490\nAn early adopter is the person that's\ngoing to stand outside a certain store\n\n232\n00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.490\nwhenever they decide to\nrelease some new technology.\n\n233\n00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.400\nThe ones that stand there from 5\no'clock in the morning just to\n\n234\n00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.790\nmake sure they get their hands on it,\nand that'll be me.\n\n235\n00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:18.310\nWow.\n\n236\n00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.493\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, that's-\n&gt;&gt; I'm a late adopter.\n\n237\n00:13:19.493 --> 00:13:22.945\n&gt;&gt; Really,\nthat doesn't surprise me, Ronnie.\n\n238\n00:13:22.945 --> 00:13:24.771\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not too sure what to say to that.\n\n239\n00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:28.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n240\n00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.460\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, as we discovered in a previous\n\n241\n00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:36.530\nepisode, still has an old CRT TV in a,\nwhat did you call it, a console TV?\n\n242\n00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:37.769\n&gt;&gt; It's a console TV.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n243\n00:13:37.769 --> 00:13:41.590\nYeah, so, Ronnie is a late adopter, yes.\n\n244\n00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.888\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm the one that nearly went out and\n\n245\n00:13:44.888 --> 00:13:48.249\nbought one of those curved screens when\nthey were the fashion for that six months.\n\n246\n00:13:48.249 --> 00:13:49.070\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n247\n00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:49.871\n&gt;&gt; Nearly, nearly.\n\n248\n00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:50.387\n&gt;&gt; Nearly, okay.\n\n249\n00:13:50.387 --> 00:13:53.980\n&gt;&gt; So, I would be considered\nto be an agent of the change.\n\n250\n00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.980\nI'm somebody who's actually\ngoing to promote the change.\n\n251\n00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:01.440\nAnd who, if you can convince\nme that it's a great idea and\n\n252\n00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.540\nI have gone out as an early adopter.\n\n253\n00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.600\nWell, I'm gonna be really valuable to you\n\n254\n00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.610\nbecause if you're trying to implement\nchange, I am gonna promote that change\n\n255\n00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:17.810\nbecause I am going to tell everybody that,\nthat change is a great idea.\n\n256\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.164\nIn another episode,\nwe're going to talk about, and\n\n257\n00:14:20.164 --> 00:14:22.884\nthis is something that I know\nthat Ronnie's got interest in,\n\n258\n00:14:22.884 --> 00:14:25.396\nbecause we've spoken about this before,\nbut in another\n\n259\n00:14:25.396 --> 00:14:29.200\nepisode we're going to talk about sort of\nthis inflated peak of expectation as well.\n\n260\n00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.600\nAnd then you've got\nthe recipients to the change.\n\n261\n00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:38.170\nAnd the recipients to the change\nare the people that are on the receiving\n\n262\n00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.440\nend of the change.\n\n263\n00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:45.080\nThese are the people that are going\nto be affected by the change.\n\n264\n00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:50.250\nThink about in a previous episode,\nwe talked about the individuals,\n\n265\n00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.390\nand we talked about the fact that\nyou have to answer the question.\n\n266\n00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.410\nWhen you are implementing\nany sort of change,\n\n267\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:00.110\nyou have to answer the question,\nwhat's in it for me?\n\n268\n00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:06.270\nAnd answering that question will directly\nspeak to these recipients of the change.\n\n269\n00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.670\nAnd if you don't get them onboard,\nthen unfortunately,\n\n270\n00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:17.030\nthe change doesn't have a very\ngood chance of success.\n\n271\n00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.789\nAt then you've also got then in\nthat bottom right hand corner,\n\n272\n00:15:19.789 --> 00:15:20.788\nwe've got our leads.\n\n273\n00:15:20.788 --> 00:15:25.283\nAnd our leads,\nthese are the people that are going to be\n\n274\n00:15:25.283 --> 00:15:30.250\nleading the change,\ndifferent to the integrators.\n\n275\n00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:34.460\nThe integrators are the people that\nare going to be doing the work.\n\n276\n00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.540\nThese are the people that are gonna be\nimplementing the change, the leads.\n\n277\n00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.120\nThese are the people that\nare going to be directing them.\n\n278\n00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.790\nSo these are your project managers.\n\n279\n00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.870\nThese are the people that\nare managing the workflow.\n\n280\n00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.190\nThese are the people that\nare managing the change.\n\n281\n00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.480\nThey're managing the timeline.\n\n282\n00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.320\nThey may also be managing\nthe budget as well.\n\n283\n00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.280\nNow, the integrators are the people\nthat are actually going to be\n\n284\n00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.710\nperforming the change.\n\n285\n00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.890\nAnd then the agents are the people that\nare going to be accepting the change, but\n\n286\n00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.640\nthese are our early adopters.\n\n287\n00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.230\nSo you might consider them\nto be your promoters.\n\n288\n00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.020\nYou consider these people, these agents,\n\n289\n00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:13.800\nto be, well, probably your biggest\nasset to be perfectly honest.\n\n290\n00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.310\nBecause if we get it right,\nand they're all for\n\n291\n00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:21.270\nit, then maybe, maybe, Ronnie,\nwe might even convince you that\n\n292\n00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:25.225\nwearing a piece of sort of wearable\ntechnology might be a really good thing.\n\n293\n00:16:25.225 --> 00:16:29.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe not [LAUGH] But there again,\n\n294\n00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.490\nRonnie, is the recipient of a challenge.\n\n295\n00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:35.990\nAnd if we can convince him that it's a\ngreat idea, then I mean, we've seen this.\n\n296\n00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:37.605\nRonnie does actually have a cell phone.\n\n297\n00:16:37.605 --> 00:16:40.270\n[LAUGH] And\nit's a really margin one as well.\n\n298\n00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.256\nIt's up to date.\n\n299\n00:16:41.256 --> 00:16:47.420\nSo therefore, if the integrators\nare doing their work correctly,\n\n300\n00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:51.050\nif the agents are completely sold\non the change, then you know what?\n\n301\n00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:56.140\nThese recipients, Ronnie, well,\nmight actually embrace the change.\n\n302\n00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.080\nSo these are the people that are involved,\nor\n\n303\n00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.150\nthe roles that are involved in\norganizational change management.\n\n304\n00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.310\nChange management at\nan organizational level.\n\n305\n00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:09.700\nYou can't miss any of these people out.\n\n306\n00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.120\nYou have to have these roles.\n\n307\n00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:16.110\nMore importantly,\nwhen it comes to managing change,\n\n308\n00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:20.050\nyou have to understand who's\nperforming these roles?\n\n309\n00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.220\nDepending on the scale of the change,\n\n310\n00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:26.772\nthere may well be more than one\nperson performing each role.\n\n311\n00:17:26.772 --> 00:17:31.302\nOr actually, one person may be\nperforming two or three roles.\n\n312\n00:17:31.302 --> 00:17:35.587\nSo think about when you are managing\na change at that level,\n\n313\n00:17:35.587 --> 00:17:39.375\nwho are going to be your agents and\nyour recipients?\n\n314\n00:17:39.375 --> 00:17:42.031\nWho's going to be leading the change and\n\n315\n00:17:42.031 --> 00:17:45.323\nwho's going to be the integrator for\nthe change?\n\n316\n00:17:45.323 --> 00:17:47.330\nAnd is there more then one?\n\n317\n00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.670\nSo that's looking at these roles,\nlooking at the activities and\n\n318\n00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.050\ntheir responsibilities almost.\n\n319\n00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.480\nAnd when we come back,\nin our next episode,\n\n320\n00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.350\nwe're actually going to be looking\nat the categories of change.\n\n321\n00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:05.000\nAnd we're going to be looking\nat change models as well.\n\n322\n00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.200\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well,\nthank you again for\n\n323\n00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.990\nhelping us out here in understanding\na little bit more about the roles and\n\n324\n00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:15.230\nactivities that we'll find in\nthe change management process as well.\n\n325\n00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:19.690\nSo clearly defining what we see right here\nthat we've been talking about, right?\n\n326\n00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:24.020\nThe idea of the governance board, the\nsponsors, the integrators, the recipients.\n\n327\n00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:24.740\nI missed one.\n\n328\n00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:25.350\nAgents, recipients-\n\n329\n00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:26.731\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then leads.\n\n330\n00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:31.005\nUnderstanding those will begin to help you\nto be able to set into motion what you\n\n331\n00:18:31.005 --> 00:18:35.214\nneed to, and understand what resources\nthat you also have on hand as you start\n\n332\n00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:38.170\nmanaging the organizational\nchange as well.\n\n333\n00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.820\nBut there is more to come,\nas Jo has actually indicated here.\n\n334\n00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.880\nSo that means this is a great place for\nus to end this episode.\n\n335\n00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.800\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n336\n00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:48.880\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n337\n00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.094\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nOrganizational Change Management episodes.\n\n338\n00:18:52.094 --> 00:19:00.351\n[MUSIC]\n\n339\n00:19:00.351 --> 00:19:03.149\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.308\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:12.418\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.418 --> 00:00:15.759\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.889\nYou're watching the Organizational\nChange Management show, I'm your host,\n\n7\n00:00:19.889 --> 00:00:24.300\nRonnie Wong, and today we'll gonna be\ntaking a look at categories of change.\n\n8\n00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.337\nAnd here of course to help us out is our\nempress of organization change once again,\n\n9\n00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:31.750\nJo Peacock, Jo, welcome to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.560\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\nhaving me Ronnie, how are you?\n\n11\n00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.610\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine Jo, as we continue\non in this idea of learning more\n\n12\n00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.700\nabout the idea of organizational\nchange management here.\n\n13\n00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.680\nSo Joe, we've already covered some of the\ndifferent concepts of previous episodes.\n\n14\n00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.473\nWe've talked about what change is a little\nbit more and we've talked about resistance\n\n15\n00:00:49.473 --> 00:00:52.904\nto it, and even who leads it but\nJo, categories have change.\n\n16\n00:00:52.904 --> 00:00:55.150\nI mean really how many categories\nHow many grades are there.\n\n17\n00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.970\nThere is change or there is not change,\nyou're telling me there is categories now.\n\n18\n00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.885\n&gt;&gt; Well, according to the PMI,\nthe Project Management Institute,\n\n19\n00:01:00.885 --> 00:01:02.556\nthere are four categories of change.\n\n20\n00:01:02.556 --> 00:01:03.336\n&gt;&gt; Wow, okay.\n\n21\n00:01:03.336 --> 00:01:06.012\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't like to think of them as\n\n22\n00:01:06.012 --> 00:01:08.893\ncategories I like to think of\nthem more as considerations.\n\n23\n00:01:08.893 --> 00:01:13.031\nThese are the four things that we need to\nconsider when we're implementing change,\n\n24\n00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:16.025\nor maybe you might wanna\ncall them aspects to change.\n\n25\n00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:21.041\nI mean certainly, you're going to find\nthat when it comes to studying for any\n\n26\n00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:26.767\nparticular test, there are always going to\nbe specific words that we're going to use.\n\n27\n00:01:26.767 --> 00:01:30.613\nWhen it comes to study, and they're gonna\nhelp you in your tests, themselves.\n\n28\n00:01:30.613 --> 00:01:35.053\nBut nevertheless, I much prefer to\nput it into plain and simple English,\n\n29\n00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:38.074\ncuz it helps me understand\n[LAUGH] if nothing else.\n\n30\n00:01:38.074 --> 00:01:41.392\nMind you, though, that's my plain and\nsimple English, all right,\n\n31\n00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:44.444\nthat's not necessarily yours,\nbut that's what works for me.\n\n32\n00:01:44.444 --> 00:01:48.114\nSo, we're going to look at PMI calls\nthe Four Categories of Change,\n\n33\n00:01:48.114 --> 00:01:50.480\nwhat I like to call the Four Aspects.\n\n34\n00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.010\nAnd these are changes in\npsychological transition and\n\n35\n00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.810\nwhat that is is really\nemotional cycle of change.\n\n36\n00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.270\nSo, we're gonna look at\nthe emotions behind change.\n\n37\n00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.190\nAnd then we're going to look\nat change as a process.\n\n38\n00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.310\nThere is a process for\norganizational change management.\n\n39\n00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.315\nIt was actually created by\nsomebody called John Carter, and\n\n40\n00:02:12.315 --> 00:02:17.891\nhe is an alumni of Harvard University, and\nhe came up with a process which actually,\n\n41\n00:02:17.891 --> 00:02:21.710\nit makes perfect sense and\nI absolutely love it.\n\n42\n00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.350\nEight Steps to Transformational Change and\nso we're going to look at that, and\n\n43\n00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.260\nthat's what we would consider to be\nthe process for transformational change or\n\n44\n00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.250\norganizational change.\n\n45\n00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.750\nThen we're gonna look at first order and\nsecond order and third order changes, and\n\n46\n00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.650\nwhy it's important to\ncategorize change in that way.\n\n47\n00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.630\nSo that we can understand\nthe adaptability that's needed, but\n\n48\n00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.390\nalso the potential reversibility\nof that particular change.\n\n49\n00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.580\nAnd then we're gonna look at\ncustom change models as well, and\n\n50\n00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.020\nby the way there is some downloadable\nmaterial available for you.\n\n51\n00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.885\nIt's gonna be invaluable when\nit comes to your studies but,\n\n52\n00:02:59.885 --> 00:03:03.089\nyou're going to find some graphical\nrepresentations of the custom\n\n53\n00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.084\nchange models that we're gonna\ntalk about a little bit later.\n\n54\n00:03:06.084 --> 00:03:10.908\nSo be sure to download the the PDFs,\nthe PowerPoint slides that\n\n55\n00:03:10.908 --> 00:03:15.742\nare available to you if you want\nyou to help with your studying.\n\n56\n00:03:15.742 --> 00:03:20.697\nSo let's look at this change as\na psychological transition then,\n\n57\n00:03:20.697 --> 00:03:25.295\nand you'll see here,\non our slide right in front of us right,\n\n58\n00:03:25.295 --> 00:03:31.144\nwhat you've got is what we call, or\nwhat I call the emotional cycle of change.\n\n59\n00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:35.904\nWhen I came to a previous episode,\nin fact our first episode in this\n\n60\n00:03:35.904 --> 00:03:39.984\nparticular series,\nwe started talking about change and\n\n61\n00:03:39.984 --> 00:03:44.492\nI asked you for some kind of word\nassociation to do with change.\n\n62\n00:03:44.492 --> 00:03:49.620\nAnd you came out with a lot of\npositive things to say about change.\n\n63\n00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.820\n&gt;&gt; I did,\nyes when we started talking about it,\n\n64\n00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.990\nwe started using words like\nanticipation and anxiety.\n\n65\n00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.968\nAs what I said and you said,\nyeah those were very positive.\n\n66\n00:03:57.968 --> 00:04:01.175\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, well I've read about anxiety,\n\n67\n00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:05.787\n[LAUGH] okay, yeah anticipation yeah\nthat's a good one, anxiety, okay.\n\n68\n00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:08.531\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sometime I worry about him,\n\n69\n00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:12.247\nanyone that uses the word\nanxiety as a positive word.\n\n70\n00:04:12.247 --> 00:04:14.944\nBut alright I was actually being Ms.\n\n71\n00:04:14.944 --> 00:04:19.821\nDebbie Downer because I was the one\ntalking about the negativity.\n\n72\n00:04:19.821 --> 00:04:23.485\nI was the one talking about the negative\nwords, and there's a reason for that.\n\n73\n00:04:23.485 --> 00:04:28.170\nBecause change is what\nall suppose to improve.\n\n74\n00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.050\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n75\n00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah suppose to.\n\n76\n00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.440\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n77\n00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.913\n&gt;&gt; And yet there were quite a few\npeople that will perceive change as\n\n78\n00:04:34.913 --> 00:04:35.951\na negative thing.\n\n79\n00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:37.790\nAnd this is neither good nor bad,\n\n80\n00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.820\nyou can't say that you know\nthat's a terrible thing.\n\n81\n00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.414\nThe fact of the matter is\nthat it's human nature, and\n\n82\n00:04:45.414 --> 00:04:48.996\nwe have an intrinsic fear of the unknown.\n\n83\n00:04:48.996 --> 00:04:53.685\nWe do, as human beings we're all\na little bit scared of the unknown.\n\n84\n00:04:53.685 --> 00:04:58.287\nIt's that feeling that I'm not too\nsure I really want to do this but\n\n85\n00:04:58.287 --> 00:05:00.021\nI'm gonna do it anyway.\n\n86\n00:05:00.021 --> 00:05:05.290\nWhat we've got to do is we've got to if\nwe're managing change in an organization,\n\n87\n00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.903\nwe have got to understand that\npeople feel like this, and\n\n88\n00:05:08.903 --> 00:05:11.490\nwe have got to manage them through this.\n\n89\n00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.685\nWhenever anybody announces\nany major change,\n\n90\n00:05:15.685 --> 00:05:18.454\nand we're talking about\norganizational-level change here.\n\n91\n00:05:18.454 --> 00:05:23.601\nSo whenever there's a major change\nannounced in an organization, the first\n\n92\n00:05:23.601 --> 00:05:28.599\nthing that you think of is what's in it\nfor me, how is it going to affect me?\n\n93\n00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.663\nAnd we're gonna talk about communication\nin change in another episode.\n\n94\n00:05:32.663 --> 00:05:36.135\nOne of our later episodes,\nwe'll cover that, but if we don't get\n\n95\n00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:40.240\nthe communication right, if we don't\ncommunicate at the individual level.\n\n96\n00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.450\nThen what starts to happen is rumors\nstart to happen, and with rumors well,\n\n97\n00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.751\nthat's just a breeding ground for\nthe negativity.\n\n98\n00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:54.817\nTake a look at this, the change\nhere is a psychological transition.\n\n99\n00:05:54.817 --> 00:05:56.412\nYou've got three stages, but\n\n100\n00:05:56.412 --> 00:05:59.242\nI actually want to look at\nwhat's in the bubbles here.\n\n101\n00:05:59.242 --> 00:06:03.509\nShock, denial, anger, depression,\nacceptance, and integration.\n\n102\n00:06:05.417 --> 00:06:10.965\nThat left hand axis, that y-axis,\nit says performance there but\n\n103\n00:06:10.965 --> 00:06:15.760\nyou'll see where these\nparticular lines starts.\n\n104\n00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:22.618\nAnd where it starts on the left hand side,\nthat is the announcement of the change.\n\n105\n00:06:22.618 --> 00:06:29.143\nAs the change is announced, as we start to\nimplement the change, you'll notice shock,\n\n106\n00:06:29.143 --> 00:06:34.276\nthat's the moment when you think I\ncan't believe this is happening.\n\n107\n00:06:36.192 --> 00:06:39.829\nAnd then we go through denial,\nand denial is,\n\n108\n00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:43.573\nno this is not happening\nto me I'm ignoring it.\n\n109\n00:06:43.573 --> 00:06:47.284\nYou'll notice though,\nthat line is actually performance, and\n\n110\n00:06:47.284 --> 00:06:50.597\nwhen the change is first announced,\nperformance drops.\n\n111\n00:06:50.597 --> 00:06:54.133\nBut performance peaks again,\nthat's quite interesting and\n\n112\n00:06:54.133 --> 00:06:57.197\nthat's a proven fact that\nperformance peaks again.\n\n113\n00:06:57.197 --> 00:07:02.168\nBecause during that denial,\nthat's that sort of passive resistance.\n\n114\n00:07:02.168 --> 00:07:04.752\nThat's where you're saying, no, no, no,\n\n115\n00:07:04.752 --> 00:07:09.280\nit's not gonna happen until you carry on\nworking in the way that you were before.\n\n116\n00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.689\nYou'll notice the performance goes\nback to where we were before,\n\n117\n00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:16.920\nif not a little bit bitter.\n\n118\n00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:23.185\nBecause sometimes the natural\nreaction is to prove you wrong.\n\n119\n00:07:23.185 --> 00:07:26.917\nYeah I'm gonna announce a change,\nlet's, and\n\n120\n00:07:26.917 --> 00:07:31.296\nactually this is something\nthat I desperately wanna do.\n\n121\n00:07:31.296 --> 00:07:32.724\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Ronnie's not gonna be\n\n122\n00:07:32.724 --> 00:07:34.197\nhappy with me about this one.\n\n123\n00:07:34.197 --> 00:07:38.398\nSo Ronnie,\nlet's say that I said to you that okay,\n\n124\n00:07:38.398 --> 00:07:41.731\nit's about time you traded in your car.\n\n125\n00:07:41.731 --> 00:07:45.001\n[LAUGH] So\ninitially you'll get the shop, and\n\n126\n00:07:45.001 --> 00:07:48.364\nthen you're gonna go\nthrough a point in time.\n\n127\n00:07:48.364 --> 00:07:53.462\nA period of time of proving a point that\nthere's nothing wrong with your car right?\n\n128\n00:07:53.462 --> 00:07:54.910\n&gt;&gt; Sure, yes I believe it.\n\n129\n00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.838\n&gt;&gt; That's that denial bit.\n\n130\n00:07:56.838 --> 00:07:57.709\n&gt;&gt; Denial.\n\n131\n00:07:57.709 --> 00:08:03.408\n&gt;&gt; That's the denial, there is nothing\nwrong with this car, I'm keeping it.\n\n132\n00:08:03.408 --> 00:08:05.275\nAnd then you go through the anger.\n\n133\n00:08:05.275 --> 00:08:07.633\nI can't believe Jo's doing this to me.\n\n134\n00:08:07.633 --> 00:08:09.350\nI really can't believe she's doing it.\n\n135\n00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.690\nAnd then the depression.\n\n136\n00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.710\nWhy me?\n\n137\n00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.180\nWhy is it happening to me?\n\n138\n00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.489\nWhy isn't it happening to anybody else?\n\n139\n00:08:16.489 --> 00:08:18.765\nWhy is it happening to me?\n\n140\n00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:22.955\nAnd then eventually you get through\nthat stage into acceptance.\n\n141\n00:08:22.955 --> 00:08:28.090\nAnd then as we go through into acceptance,\nthat's when we get into the integration.\n\n142\n00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.447\nAnd that's where you'll notice that\nperformance then starts to peak.\n\n143\n00:08:32.447 --> 00:08:35.747\nAnd performance, well, it should improve.\n\n144\n00:08:35.747 --> 00:08:37.137\nIt should be better.\n\n145\n00:08:37.137 --> 00:08:38.906\nThat's when Ronnie's got his car [LAUGH].\n\n146\n00:08:38.906 --> 00:08:43.917\nAnd the performance should be\nbetter than he had previously.\n\n147\n00:08:43.917 --> 00:08:46.267\nBut we've gotta go through all of that.\n\n148\n00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.300\nSo you might then ask yourself,\nwhat's the point then?\n\n149\n00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.970\nWhat's the point in having this graph, if\nwe know that this is what's gonna happen,\n\n150\n00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.460\nthen why do we need to make it obvious?\n\n151\n00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.320\nIf we make it obvious,\n\n152\n00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.530\nif I know that Ronnie's not going to be\nhappy about having to change his car,\n\n153\n00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:09.408\nI can then work to justify why\nRonnie needs to change his car.\n\n154\n00:09:09.408 --> 00:09:14.520\nI can formulate my communication\nplan to ensure that\n\n155\n00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.610\nRonnie is not only communicated to,\n\n156\n00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:21.140\nbut that we have the option for\ncommunicating on a two-way basis.\n\n157\n00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.820\nSo that I can ask Ronnie his opinion,\nso that I can get his involvement.\n\n158\n00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.382\nAnd if I can get his involvement,\nthen what I am doing is,\n\n159\n00:09:29.382 --> 00:09:32.810\nI am hopefully removing the anger and\nthe depression.\n\n160\n00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:38.037\nWhat I'd like to do is go\nstraight from shock, well,\n\n161\n00:09:38.037 --> 00:09:43.081\nI'd like there not to be any shock\nto be honest, but what I'd like\n\n162\n00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:49.170\nto do is go straight from that shock,\nstraight the way through to acceptance.\n\n163\n00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.390\nIf we get it right,\nthen we don't even have the shock,\n\n164\n00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:55.960\nbecause Ronnie's already on board and\nhe's driving this.\n\n165\n00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:00.060\nIf we get it wrong,\nthan this is what you get.\n\n166\n00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.600\nI have actually seen instances where this\nhas been greatly exaggerated as well.\n\n167\n00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.790\nBecause things can go horribly wrong,\nand it could take us a long time.\n\n168\n00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:13.210\nWhat do you think the average time from\nthe initial announcement right the way\n\n169\n00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.207\nthrough to integration,\nwhat do you think that is?\n\n170\n00:10:16.207 --> 00:10:20.891\n&gt;&gt; I would not absolutely have any\nclue to even have a basis to guess of\n\n171\n00:10:20.891 --> 00:10:23.200\nwhat the initial time would be.\n\n172\n00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.355\nI'm gonna say six weeks [LAUGH].\n\n173\n00:10:25.355 --> 00:10:29.820\n&gt;&gt; Right, organizational change, we're\ntalking transformational change here and\n\n174\n00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.390\nyou think that all that's\ngonna happen six weeks.\n\n175\n00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.485\n&gt;&gt; Sure, I'm positive, I'm a positive guy.\n\n176\n00:10:35.485 --> 00:10:39.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay then I'll be the realist to you.\n\n177\n00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.170\nHow about 18 months?\n\n178\n00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.040\n&gt;&gt; 18 months.\n\n179\n00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.790\n&gt;&gt; Right yeah, I mean we're talking\nabout transformational change.\n\n180\n00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.300\nI don't know where he's worked,\nI really don't.\n\n181\n00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.170\nBut we're talking about\ntransformational change.\n\n182\n00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.670\nTransformational change is not something\nthat is going to happen overnight.\n\n183\n00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.060\n&gt;&gt; Or in six weeks.\n\n184\n00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.610\n&gt;&gt; Or even in six weeks, right?\n\n185\n00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.520\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n&gt;&gt; But a year to 18 months maybe yes.\n\n186\n00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If we this out,\n\n187\n00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:09.215\nthen it could have more than six weeks.\n\n188\n00:11:09.215 --> 00:11:11.070\n[LAUGH] But\nit could happen really quickly.\n\n189\n00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:11.990\n&gt;&gt; Shorter, shorter?\n\n190\n00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI would wanna see this shorter, but\n\n191\n00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.400\nit could happen in\na shorter period of time.\n\n192\n00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.140\nMaybe even six months.\n\n193\n00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We're talking transformational change,\n\n194\n00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.830\nwe could take a whole year off this,\n\n195\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.920\nwe could make this a year less painful,\nif we manage it.\n\n196\n00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.080\nSo how do we manage it?\n\n197\n00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.470\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n198\n00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.520\nthat's where this next slide comes in.\n\n199\n00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.550\nAnd this is, well, in Peer Mind\nwe call this Change as a Process.\n\n200\n00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.620\nBut I like to refer to this\nas Kotter's eight steps.\n\n201\n00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.360\nAnd Kotter's eight steps\nto transformational change,\n\n202\n00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:47.380\nI like this because it is simple.\n\n203\n00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:52.370\nAnd it's kind of obvious,\nbut it makes complete sense.\n\n204\n00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.894\nIt's about establishing\na sense of urgency.\n\n205\n00:11:54.894 --> 00:11:59.431\nOne of the things that we have to do\nis we have to be able to understand\n\n206\n00:11:59.431 --> 00:12:03.980\nthe individual as being affective and\nwe have to communicate why.\n\n207\n00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:08.656\nIf you don't communicate why, if that\nindividual doesn't sense a need, if you\n\n208\n00:12:08.656 --> 00:12:13.360\ndon't sense a need for changing your car,\nyou're not going to change your car.\n\n209\n00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.350\nAnd it doesn't matter how much I try and\nconvince you.\n\n210\n00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.594\nAnd I know that I've used\nthese words previously.\n\n211\n00:12:19.594 --> 00:12:23.348\nIt doesn't matter how much I try and\nconvince you, you're still not gonna be\n\n212\n00:12:23.348 --> 00:12:27.110\nsold on this, you're still not\ngonna be bought into this.\n\n213\n00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:31.640\nSo what I have to do in order\nto ensure successful change,\n\n214\n00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:36.980\nI have to, well, create a need,\nthat's that sense of urgency.\n\n215\n00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.590\nThere's a company that's really,\nreally good at this.\n\n216\n00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.330\nAnd so\nI'm going to tell you a little story.\n\n217\n00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:49.990\nWhen Apple first announced,\nyears ago now, but when they\n\n218\n00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:55.200\nfirst announced that they were gonna bring\nout this wearable technology, this watch.\n\n219\n00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.950\nI can tell you now,\n\n220\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.360\nthat, I can't even remember who\ndelivered the keynote speech for this.\n\n221\n00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.540\nBut I can tell you now,\n\n222\n00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.565\nthat all of a sudden this watch\nshaped hole opened up in my life.\n\n223\n00:13:05.565 --> 00:13:09.200\n[LAUGH] And I needed a watch,\nI had to have a watch.\n\n224\n00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.180\nWe'll get on to what happened once\nI got the watch afterwards, but\n\n225\n00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.250\nthe fact of the matter is\nthere was a need created.\n\n226\n00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:21.210\nAnd it doesn't matter whether you\nlike them as an organization or not.\n\n227\n00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:24.050\nOr whether you actually like\nany of their technology or not.\n\n228\n00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:29.650\nThe fact is, that they are incredibly\ngood at driving transformational change.\n\n229\n00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:32.130\nBecause the thing that\nthey have understood,\n\n230\n00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:35.920\nthe thing that they have\nestablished first, is that need.\n\n231\n00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.730\nIt's the why, why do you want something?\n\n232\n00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.070\nWhy do you want change?\n\n233\n00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.050\nAnd then after we've established the why,\n\n234\n00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.350\nthat's when we form\nthis guiding coalition.\n\n235\n00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:51.380\nAnd the guiding coalition,\nthat's a coalition of leaders,\n\n236\n00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.590\nsomebody who can guide,\nthink about our governance.\n\n237\n00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:59.160\nSo it has to be somebody senior\nenough to be able to influence, but\n\n238\n00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.680\nthey have to be, not just dragged\nalong kicking and screaming,\n\n239\n00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:09.210\nthey have to understand the need and\nthey have to promote the need, as well.\n\n240\n00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:13.280\nAnd they create a vision for\nthe change that they than communicate.\n\n241\n00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.910\nWe'll talk about communication\nin another episode.\n\n242\n00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.640\nBut they'll communicate in\nthe right language, too.\n\n243\n00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.710\nAnd that will empower others.\n\n244\n00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:27.700\nYou know what, I'm gonna get Ronnie on\nboard with whatever change that I want.\n\n245\n00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:32.970\nI'm gonna get him on board quicker and\neasier, If I ask him to do something.\n\n246\n00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.960\nIf I get him involved.\n\n247\n00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.210\nIf I just tell him what's gonna happen,\n\n248\n00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:42.350\nthen he's not going to\nbe sold on any change.\n\n249\n00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:47.350\nAt least not with as much passion as I\nwant him to be, but if I get him involved,\n\n250\n00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:52.550\nif I empower him, and\nif I give him actionable things to do.\n\n251\n00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:58.520\nActivities, to drive the change, then\nRonnie's gonna be more bought into this.\n\n252\n00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:04.160\nSo empowering others, and\nsomething else that we've gotta do.\n\n253\n00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.749\nThis is what I call common sense, because\nnumber six is about short term wins.\n\n254\n00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.220\nIt's about visibility and\n\n255\n00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:18.020\nit's about building up our improvements\none after the next after the next.\n\n256\n00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.760\nIt's about changing intuitively...\n\n257\n00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.240\nIt's about one step at a time, but\n\n258\n00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:31.810\neach step has to be a visible step\nthat enables us to build momentum.\n\n259\n00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:36.940\nI'd like to think about this as the\ndifference between driving and walking.\n\n260\n00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:42.700\nYou see when I'm driving,\nit can be very difficult for\n\n261\n00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:47.950\nme to gauge exactly how far I've got\nto go or exactly how far I've gone.\n\n262\n00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:52.887\nBecause by the time I've checked my\n[INAUDIBLE], or my GPS, it's out of date.\n\n263\n00:15:52.887 --> 00:15:54.277\nEspecially at the speed that I travel.\n\n264\n00:15:54.277 --> 00:15:57.121\nI just hope there's no\ncops watching right.\n\n265\n00:15:57.121 --> 00:16:00.591\nIt's very difficult for\nus to gauge exactly how far we've gone.\n\n266\n00:16:00.591 --> 00:16:06.452\nBut with each step I take, if I'm walking,\nthen with every Single step.\n\n267\n00:16:06.452 --> 00:16:12.240\nI have an exact point in time, and I have\nan exact measurement of my progress.\n\n268\n00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:19.490\nSo I can see visibly exactly how far I've\ncome, and exactly how far I've got to go.\n\n269\n00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.570\nAnd so what we want to do is\nhave these short term wins,\n\n270\n00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:28.630\nthat create visibility of any change.\n\n271\n00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:33.120\nAnd also that build on\nprevious improvements,\n\n272\n00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.820\nwhich is why we talk about\nconsolidating the improvements.\n\n273\n00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.420\nAnd then when we look back,\nwe see just really how far we have come.\n\n274\n00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.210\nAnd then the last step in this\nis to institutionalize or\n\n275\n00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:49.970\nembed these new approaches,\nmake it become a way working.\n\n276\n00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:57.120\nSo that there's no going back,\nbecause people don't want to go back.\n\n277\n00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.740\nNot because they can't, but\nbecause they don't want to,\n\n278\n00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.430\nbecause this way is the best.\n\n279\n00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:08.510\nSo this about Carter's eight steps and\nthis is change as a process.\n\n280\n00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.491\nSo let's look at the different\norders of change now.\n\n281\n00:17:11.491 --> 00:17:14.390\nAnd you'll see that we have got these\non the screen right in front of us.\n\n282\n00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:17.696\nWe've got first order change,\nwe've got second order change, and\n\n283\n00:17:17.696 --> 00:17:19.237\nwe've got third order change.\n\n284\n00:17:19.237 --> 00:17:21.380\nAre these something that\nyou've heard of before?\n\n285\n00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.250\n&gt;&gt; No, I have not heard of this idea of\nfirst, second and third order of change.\n\n286\n00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:29.270\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, let me go over\nthis then very, very briefly and\n\n287\n00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.510\nthere are some, this is it,\n\n288\n00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:34.110\nthere are some graphics available\nin downloadable material for you.\n\n289\n00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:38.360\nBut a first order change is the change\nto the way that I do something.\n\n290\n00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:44.780\nA first order change is not\nthreatening to me as an individual.\n\n291\n00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.370\nAnd it's really, really easy reverse.\n\n292\n00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.560\nYou've heard phrases like well,\nwe're gonna give it a try and if we don't\n\n293\n00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.572\nlike it, we can go back to the way things\nare, or the way things were before.\n\n294\n00:17:54.572 --> 00:17:57.110\nThat's what we would consider\na first order change.\n\n295\n00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:02.470\nSo a change to the way that we do\nsomething, a change to maybe a signature,\n\n296\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.810\nor an email, for instance, or\nchange to a particular process,\n\n297\n00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:09.050\nthat's what we would consider\nto be a first order change.\n\n298\n00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:14.460\nSo the length of that particular change,\nthe length of the initiative, or\n\n299\n00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.760\nthe deployment, if you want to call it\nthat, it's gonna be relatively short.\n\n300\n00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.300\nThen we've got second order changes.\n\n301\n00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:26.100\nSecond order changes\nare changes to a strategy,\n\n302\n00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.880\nchanges to a concept, for instance.\n\n303\n00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.805\nSo it's change that not just involves me,\nbut\n\n304\n00:18:31.805 --> 00:18:35.335\nits change that may involve\neverybody within our team.\n\n305\n00:18:35.335 --> 00:18:39.010\nSecond order change is\ngoing to be irreversible.\n\n306\n00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.900\nIt's something that once we've made\nthe change, you can't go back on.\n\n307\n00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.670\nWe've changed our strategy.\n\n308\n00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:52.905\nSo maybe what we've done is we've got\na new strategy and a new piece of software\n\n309\n00:18:52.905 --> 00:18:57.405\nthat we've brought in for managing\nour customer database for instance.\n\n310\n00:18:57.405 --> 00:19:00.085\nAnd once we've changed that data over,\nwe can't go back.\n\n311\n00:19:01.155 --> 00:19:03.429\nThat's what we would consider\na second-order change.\n\n312\n00:19:03.429 --> 00:19:07.305\nIt's irreversible, and\nit affects a lot of people.\n\n313\n00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.340\nAnd then we've got these\nthird-order changes.\n\n314\n00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:15.960\nAnd the third-order changes, you'll\nnotice that they too are irreversible.\n\n315\n00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.010\nAnd these are sort of long-term changes.\n\n316\n00:19:20.058 --> 00:19:24.760\nAnd those long-term changes might be\nsomething like maybe a merger with another\n\n317\n00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.768\norganization.\n\n318\n00:19:25.768 --> 00:19:29.381\nThat's a long-term change,\nthat's a third-order change.\n\n319\n00:19:29.381 --> 00:19:35.725\nA change to governance, a chance to\nethics, a change to the way that we think.\n\n320\n00:19:35.725 --> 00:19:38.978\nBut I want to look down that\nmiddle column for a moment,\n\n321\n00:19:38.978 --> 00:19:44.304\ncuz you'll see that first-order changes\nisn't threatening to an individual person.\n\n322\n00:19:44.304 --> 00:19:47.400\nThe second order change\nmight be threatening.\n\n323\n00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:52.810\nBecause let's say we were bringing\nin some new software, then\n\n324\n00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:57.490\nit might do away with a particular\nperson or their particular role.\n\n325\n00:19:58.548 --> 00:20:01.490\nWhereas a third-order change\nis always going to be\n\n326\n00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.120\nperceived as incredibly threatening.\n\n327\n00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.070\nIf we're merging with\nanother organization,\n\n328\n00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.310\nthen there's definitely going\nto be duplicate roles and so\n\n329\n00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:10.180\nthere's gonna be a lot of\npeople that feel threatened.\n\n330\n00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.750\nWhy is it relevant then?\n\n331\n00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.140\nWhy do you think it's relevant for\n\n332\n00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:19.720\nus to know whether the change that we make\nin this first, or second, or third order?\n\n333\n00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.630\n&gt;&gt; Because it affects directly\npeople that are involved in\n\n334\n00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.400\nwhat's gonna be happening here.\n\n335\n00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.020\nSo if we wanna make change,\nwe've got to actually figure out which\n\n336\n00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:34.858\none is gonna bring us the most effective\npositive improvement that we need.\n\n337\n00:20:34.858 --> 00:20:41.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and also, let's go back to\nthat emotional cycle of change.\n\n338\n00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.330\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because that emotional cycle of change\n\n339\n00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.270\nis gonna be incredibly important to us.\n\n340\n00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.510\nIf we're talking about\nthe third-order change, or\n\n341\n00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:52.850\neven a second-order change,\nthen you're really going to have to engage\n\n342\n00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:58.110\nthat particular cycle as early as\npossible in the life of that change.\n\n343\n00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.460\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n344\n00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:00.770\n&gt;&gt; You have to think about people.\n\n345\n00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.140\nYou have to think about how\nthey're going to be affected.\n\n346\n00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.994\nRemember what I said about lack\nof communication leads to rumors?\n\n347\n00:21:06.994 --> 00:21:07.860\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n348\n00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.090\n&gt;&gt; And if we have rumors,\nif we have that lack of communication,\n\n349\n00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:14.290\nthen the change is going\nto be unsuccessful.\n\n350\n00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:19.810\nI have seen some really\nbadly managed changes\n\n351\n00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:25.740\nin organizations where a lot of the key\npeople have left the organization.\n\n352\n00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.730\nAnd yet, these were the people\nthe organization needed to retain.\n\n353\n00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:32.794\nThey're the people that the organization\nneeded to keep hold of but\n\n354\n00:21:32.794 --> 00:21:36.368\nthey've actually left because\nof lack of communication.\n\n355\n00:21:36.368 --> 00:21:42.860\nBecause the emotional cycle of change,\nthe emotional issues weren't addressed.\n\n356\n00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.110\nAnd so that's the last thing we want.\n\n357\n00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:47.830\nWhen we're in something like the second or\nthird order change,\n\n358\n00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:52.190\nwe have to be conscious\nof the individuals.\n\n359\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.625\nBut working with people,\nwe are dealing with people and\n\n360\n00:21:55.625 --> 00:21:58.268\nour people are vital to our organization.\n\n361\n00:21:58.268 --> 00:22:02.647\nAnd so if we neglect the people\nside of things, then unfortunately,\n\n362\n00:22:02.647 --> 00:22:05.090\nthe change would be successful.\n\n363\n00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:10.290\nRemember everybody is interested\nin what a change means to them.\n\n364\n00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:17.912\nSo then lastly we're gonna look at\nthese individual custom change models.\n\n365\n00:22:17.912 --> 00:22:20.670\nA change model,\na model is a pre-defined set of steps.\n\n366\n00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.880\nSo it's a predefined way\nof dealing with things.\n\n367\n00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:29.280\nSo we have specific change models,\nfor instance, the ADKAR model.\n\n368\n00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.480\nAnd the ADKAR model is about awareness,\ndesire, and knowledge,\n\n369\n00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.900\nability, reinforcement.\n\n370\n00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.710\nAnd we also have the technology\nadoption curve, and\n\n371\n00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:44.010\nthe 7S Framework, and we've also got\nour seven hours of reasons for change.\n\n372\n00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:50.150\nAnd these are specific considerations that\nwe would use when implementing change.\n\n373\n00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:55.549\nWe have to be aware of these when we're\nimplementing organizational change.\n\n374\n00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:59.320\nI'm gonna go through each of\nthese in a little bit more depth.\n\n375\n00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.490\nSo let's take a look first of all\nat our technology adoption curve.\n\n376\n00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:09.330\nWhich is that one there,\nRoger's technology adoption curve.\n\n377\n00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:13.780\nAnd you'll see here that this\nis the adoption curve for\n\n378\n00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.970\nany sorts of technology.\n\n379\n00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:22.184\nI can tell you now that I am\nwhat we call an early adopter.\n\n380\n00:23:22.184 --> 00:23:23.520\nWhere are you?\n\n381\n00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.094\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say Laggard.\n\n382\n00:23:25.094 --> 00:23:29.019\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's not beating about the bush\n\n383\n00:23:29.019 --> 00:23:33.250\nthere, Ronnie has decided he's\ngonna be in the last 16%.\n\n384\n00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:37.098\n&gt;&gt; I'm kind of on the way\nedge on the right there.\n\n385\n00:23:37.098 --> 00:23:42.230\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what do you think\nmotivates the Early Adopters?\n\n386\n00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.620\n&gt;&gt; The newness of the technology itself.\n\n387\n00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:46.570\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n388\n00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:49.132\nSo it's the fun factor-\n&gt;&gt; The fun factor, sure.\n\n389\n00:23:49.132 --> 00:23:49.750\n&gt;&gt; The excitement.\n\n390\n00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:53.480\nYeah, I've got something new\nthat you don't have, ha ha.\n\n391\n00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.680\nEven though you're there thinking,\nwell I don't want that just yet, right?\n\n392\n00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.048\n&gt;&gt; True.\n[LAUGH]\n\n393\n00:23:58.048 --> 00:23:59.777\n&gt;&gt; So, it's the excitement.\n\n394\n00:23:59.777 --> 00:24:06.959\nSo the early adopters are going to be\nWell, they're going to be communicated to.\n\n395\n00:24:06.959 --> 00:24:13.960\nThey're gonna be brought into this\nby you communicating the benefit.\n\n396\n00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.820\nOne of the benefits,\nI'm looking at the excitement factors,\n\n397\n00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.830\nthat's what you've got to communicate.\n\n398\n00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:20.750\nSo what about the early majority then?\n\n399\n00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.860\nWhat do I need to communicate\nto bring them on board?\n\n400\n00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.886\n&gt;&gt; I think you still bring a little bit\nof that hype or that excitement, but\n\n401\n00:24:28.886 --> 00:24:31.711\nyou start to talk about the value\nthat they're gonna get.\n\n402\n00:24:31.711 --> 00:24:35.650\n&gt;&gt; Right, you wanna talk about benefits,\nI mentioned that word benefits.\n\n403\n00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.460\nSo here, this is where we\nwant to talk about benefits.\n\n404\n00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.620\nThis is where we want to show benefits.\n\n405\n00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:46.760\nNow the late majority, the late majority\nare the people that are sitting back and\n\n406\n00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.560\nwaiting.\n\n407\n00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:51.060\nThese are the people that are saying,\nshow me it works.\n\n408\n00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:55.820\nThe other guys,\nthey've been brought into the hype, okay?\n\n409\n00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.490\nThey're convinced by the hype so\n\n410\n00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:01.520\nthey've got on board with it\nbecause you've said it's good.\n\n411\n00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.160\nI don't believe you show me.\n\n412\n00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:08.020\nAnd so Ronnie then you put\nyourself into that last category.\n\n413\n00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.790\nSo what drives you to change then?\n\n414\n00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:11.757\n&gt;&gt; When I have to change.\n\n415\n00:25:11.757 --> 00:25:14.257\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Because everybody has-\n\n416\n00:25:14.257 --> 00:25:15.542\n&gt;&gt; Because everybody else is changing.\n\n417\n00:25:15.542 --> 00:25:19.899\n[LAUGH] When the technology is no\nlonger sufficient to repair or\n\n418\n00:25:19.899 --> 00:25:21.417\nanything like that.\n\n419\n00:25:21.417 --> 00:25:23.218\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a lie.\n\n420\n00:25:23.218 --> 00:25:25.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just want to mention this.\n\n421\n00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.378\nThis is a lie because we just had\na conversation a little while ago about\n\n422\n00:25:29.378 --> 00:25:33.144\nthe fact that Ronnie still has\nan old CRT console television.\n\n423\n00:25:33.144 --> 00:25:35.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that he still uses VHS.\n\n424\n00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.941\nSo the fact that Ronnie is saying,\nwell, when I have to change,\n\n425\n00:25:38.941 --> 00:25:41.241\neven when he has to change,\nhe still doesn't.\n\n426\n00:25:41.241 --> 00:25:43.996\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So in terms of that scale there,\n\n427\n00:25:43.996 --> 00:25:49.080\nthere's an extra one tagged onto the end\nthere that's just got Ronnie's name on it.\n\n428\n00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.360\nI'm gonna add that in, right,\nit'll be in your downloadable material.\n\n429\n00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.710\nIt's that 0.01% that just says Ronnie.\n\n430\n00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:58.152\n[LAUGH].\n\n431\n00:25:58.152 --> 00:25:59.351\nBut yeah, you're right.\n\n432\n00:25:59.351 --> 00:26:02.820\nThe laggards are gonna be brought\nalong because they have to be.\n\n433\n00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:03.520\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n434\n00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.770\n&gt;&gt; Where's your most resistance gonna lie?\n\n435\n00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:07.940\n&gt;&gt; The most resistance?\n\n436\n00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, where is the biggest resistance?\n\n437\n00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:15.769\n&gt;&gt; I would say at the right majority,\n[LAUGH] no,\n\n438\n00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:18.909\ngotta be the laggard, right?\n\n439\n00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:19.782\n&gt;&gt; It's no actually, no.\n\n440\n00:26:19.782 --> 00:26:20.945\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's not laggard.\n\n441\n00:26:20.945 --> 00:26:21.490\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n442\n00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:23.952\n&gt;&gt; And yeah you might think that\ncuz it looks fairly obvious.\n\n443\n00:26:23.952 --> 00:26:25.858\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; But the laggards are generally the ones\n\n444\n00:26:25.858 --> 00:26:27.193\nthat kinda can't be bothered.\n\n445\n00:26:27.193 --> 00:26:27.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n446\n00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.020\n&gt;&gt; Not that I'm hinting or\nanything here, right?\n\n447\n00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.561\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the laggards are the one that\n\n448\n00:26:31.561 --> 00:26:33.030\ngenerally can't be bothered.\n\n449\n00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.156\nIn terms of resistance,\n\n450\n00:26:34.156 --> 00:26:36.238\nthey're gonna be passive resistance-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n451\n00:26:36.238 --> 00:26:38.237\n&gt;&gt; So they're not really gonna be active.\n\n452\n00:26:38.237 --> 00:26:39.440\n&gt;&gt; Late majority then.\n\n453\n00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.293\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nit is gonna be the late majority,\n\n454\n00:26:41.293 --> 00:26:44.752\nbecause they're the people that are gonna\nbe more active in their resistance.\n\n455\n00:26:44.752 --> 00:26:45.790\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n456\n00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:47.750\n&gt;&gt; And if you can convince\nthem that it's a good idea,\n\n457\n00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.220\nthen they'll finally get on board.\n\n458\n00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:53.380\nThis is as long as you can justify it,\nwhereas those that are in sort of\n\n459\n00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.250\nthe laggards, but, generally,\ncan't be bothered.\n\n460\n00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:00.053\nReally, they're gonna\nbe passively resistant,\n\n461\n00:27:00.053 --> 00:27:02.340\nas opposed to being actively resistant.\n\n462\n00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.119\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n463\n00:27:03.119 --> 00:27:06.800\nI can't imagine you campaigning against\nbeing told that you've gotta get a new TV.\n\n464\n00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:08.803\n&gt;&gt; Well, no, I- [LAUGH].\n\n465\n00:27:08.803 --> 00:27:11.160\n&gt;&gt; No, right,\nyou just can't be bothered, yeah?\n\n466\n00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.420\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n467\n00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.176\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\n\n468\n00:27:14.176 --> 00:27:15.809\nI have nothing, I have nothing.\n\n469\n00:27:15.809 --> 00:27:17.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n470\n00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:21.950\nthen on our next slide we're just\ngonna quickly look at the S's.\n\n471\n00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:24.200\nWhich are our hard S's and our soft S's.\n\n472\n00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.454\nOur 7-S framework here.\n\n473\n00:27:26.454 --> 00:27:30.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And when we are, no, no.\n\n474\n00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.140\nWhat have I said?\n\n475\n00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:32.680\n&gt;&gt; No, nothing.\n\n476\n00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.661\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There's always-\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of S's.\n\n477\n00:27:35.661 --> 00:27:38.220\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of S.\n\n478\n00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.321\n&gt;&gt; You actually have hard S's written.\n\n479\n00:27:39.321 --> 00:27:41.862\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, our hard S's,\n\n480\n00:27:41.862 --> 00:27:43.534\nthe things that we can't change.\n\n481\n00:27:43.534 --> 00:27:44.678\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And our soft S's,\n\n482\n00:27:44.678 --> 00:27:46.152\nthe things we can influence.\n\n483\n00:27:46.152 --> 00:27:47.379\n&gt;&gt; Okay that makes more sense.\n\n484\n00:27:47.379 --> 00:27:48.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n485\n00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:52.392\n&gt;&gt; So when it comes to the change,\nthis is what we want to change.\n\n486\n00:27:52.392 --> 00:27:55.990\nWe wanna change our strategy and\nour structure and our systems.\n\n487\n00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:58.640\nAnd once they're changed,\nthey are set in stone.\n\n488\n00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.213\nBut in terms of our skills-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n489\n00:28:00.213 --> 00:28:02.371\n&gt;&gt; And our style, and our staff,\n\n490\n00:28:02.371 --> 00:28:08.530\nthese are our soft S's because these are\nthe things that might change organically.\n\n491\n00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:13.400\nBut these are the things that\nwe can influence as well.\n\n492\n00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:18.320\nSo, it's not necessarily a switchover,\nwhereas with the top ones,\n\n493\n00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.240\nthat might be a switchover for the change.\n\n494\n00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.280\nSo they're the ones that we have to,\nwell if you think about this we have to\n\n495\n00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.944\nplan for the top ones, but\nwe also have to plan for the bottom ones.\n\n496\n00:28:28.944 --> 00:28:31.290\nAnd these are the ones that\nare forgotten about quite often.\n\n497\n00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:35.110\nWe tend to think that if we get\nthe structure right for a new change and\n\n498\n00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:37.270\nthe rest of it's going to come along,\nand it's not.\n\n499\n00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:44.720\nAnd the next graphic really seven hours,\nour reasons for change.\n\n500\n00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.835\nSo we have to think about\nthis is our rationale and\n\n501\n00:28:47.835 --> 00:28:50.185\nour justification for change.\n\n502\n00:28:50.185 --> 00:28:54.695\nSo think about who raised it,\nwhy they raised it, what's the reason?\n\n503\n00:28:54.695 --> 00:28:56.935\nWhat return are we\nexpecting on the change?\n\n504\n00:28:56.935 --> 00:29:00.025\nWhat are the risks involved and\nwhat are we gonna do about them?\n\n505\n00:29:00.025 --> 00:29:04.415\nAnd then the resources required and\nwho's gonna be responsible for it?\n\n506\n00:29:04.415 --> 00:29:07.760\nAnd what about the relationship\nwith other changes as well?\n\n507\n00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.950\nSo these again, are our considerations.\n\n508\n00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:13.540\nAnd these particular sort\nof pre-programmed models\n\n509\n00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.120\nare actually really useful\nwhen it comes to change.\n\n510\n00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:20.734\nThey're really useful sort of techniques\nwhen it comes to managing change.\n\n511\n00:29:20.734 --> 00:29:24.002\nAnd then of course, this one,\nI know that this is Ronnie's favorite,\n\n512\n00:29:24.002 --> 00:29:26.090\ncuz we've talked about this before.\n\n513\n00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:29.130\nAnd this is that Gartner Hype Cycle.\n\n514\n00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:33.810\nEarlier on I mentioned about this piece of\nwearable technology that I had to have.\n\n515\n00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:36.780\nWell, let's look at this\nin a bit more detail.\n\n516\n00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:41.233\nWhen Apple first announced the watch,\nthey got that technology\n\n517\n00:29:41.233 --> 00:29:45.697\ntrigger at that keynote speech\nthat they had, that was it.\n\n518\n00:29:45.697 --> 00:29:49.186\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I had this huge watch-shaped hole in my\n\n519\n00:29:49.186 --> 00:29:51.560\nlife, I had to have one.\n\n520\n00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:57.170\nTo the point where I had got myself, they\nwere so good at selling this to me, that\n\n521\n00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:01.770\nby the time I'd watched the keynote, then\nit was going through my mind constantly.\n\n522\n00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:06.030\nAnd I had got myself so worked up about\nwhat this watch was going to do for\n\n523\n00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:10.890\nme, that I had created what we call\nan inflated peak of expectation.\n\n524\n00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:12.560\nIn other words,\nit was gonna do everything.\n\n525\n00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.490\nIt was gonna make the tea for\nme on the morning when I got up.\n\n526\n00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:20.029\nIt was gonna manage all my projects,\nit was gonna open the front door for\n\n527\n00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:22.081\nme when I walked up to the house.\n\n528\n00:30:22.081 --> 00:30:24.460\nIt was gonna do absolutely everything.\n\n529\n00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:25.085\nAnd then I got it.\n\n530\n00:30:25.085 --> 00:30:29.719\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then I realized I'm blind as a bat,\n\n531\n00:30:29.719 --> 00:30:33.970\nI need these, and without these,\nwhich I generally forget or\n\n532\n00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:37.999\nleave somewhere,\nthen I can't see a thing that's on it.\n\n533\n00:30:37.999 --> 00:30:41.436\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, here we reach our chart of\n\n534\n00:30:41.436 --> 00:30:46.908\ndissolution and where I realize\nthat it sounds absolutely great and\n\n535\n00:30:46.908 --> 00:30:50.275\nit was fantastic, if only I could see it.\n\n536\n00:30:50.275 --> 00:30:51.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n537\n00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:51.965\n&gt;&gt; Eventually,\n\n538\n00:30:51.965 --> 00:30:55.919\nyou get to this what we call a slope\nof enlightenment where I learn how to\n\n539\n00:30:55.919 --> 00:30:59.016\ndo certain things on it but\nnot everything that I need.\n\n540\n00:30:59.016 --> 00:31:01.662\nBecause not only do I need a new watch,\n\n541\n00:31:01.662 --> 00:31:05.963\nI need new eyes to go with it to\nthis plateau of productivity and\n\n542\n00:31:05.963 --> 00:31:10.710\nthis plateau productivity is really well,\nwhere I am right now.\n\n543\n00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:12.725\nAnd that's where I stayed as well,\n\n544\n00:31:12.725 --> 00:31:16.540\nin that plateau of productivity\nwhere it works for me.\n\n545\n00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:21.020\nBut it's never, ever going to meet\nthat peak of inflated expectation.\n\n546\n00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:25.030\nSo, what does that mean for us then\nwhen we're managing change is we've got\n\n547\n00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.730\nto be very careful with our communication.\n\n548\n00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:30.720\nOtherwise, that's what ends up happening.\n\n549\n00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:35.082\nAnd if we're not careful with our\ncommunication, then rumors start.\n\n550\n00:31:35.082 --> 00:31:39.390\nAnd rumors can be a good thing, but\nthey can also be a bad thing too.\n\n551\n00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:42.430\nAnd the last thing we want is\na trough of disillusionment,\n\n552\n00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:47.470\nthe deeper that trough of disillusionment,\nthe worse the denial and\n\n553\n00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:51.910\nthe anger is when it comes to\nthe emotional cycle of change.\n\n554\n00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:56.330\nSo we want to even that out, and\nif we can even this out here,\n\n555\n00:31:56.330 --> 00:32:01.160\nthen we can move towards evening\nout the emotional cycle of change.\n\n556\n00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:07.080\nSo what we've looked at\nare categories of change.\n\n557\n00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:11.000\nAnd when we come back in on our next\nepisode, then, we're actually going to\n\n558\n00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.620\nlook in more depth at the actual change\nprocess, the activities that we have to go\n\n559\n00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:19.660\nthrough within organizational\nchange management itself.\n\n560\n00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:20.340\n&gt;&gt; Alright, Jo.\n\n561\n00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:23.860\nOnce again, thank you for helping us\nunderstand more about these different\n\n562\n00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:28.370\nmodels of change, or the Idea of the four\nchanges that are mentioned in PMI.\n\n563\n00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:31.720\nIt really does help us to understand that\nit's a part of what we have to understand\n\n564\n00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.500\nfor organizational management.\n\n565\n00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.710\nAnd at the end we're\nincredibly interesting here on\n\n566\n00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:39.060\nthe customized models that are out there.\n\n567\n00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.540\nCuz it really does help us to\nunderstand a little bit more.\n\n568\n00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:45.720\nThe buy in seems to be more important\nas Jo is actually talking on about\n\n569\n00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.210\nthe different concepts here.\n\n570\n00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:50.790\nBut there is more to come then, and\nthat means we're gonna end this episode.\n\n571\n00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:54.660\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n572\n00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:55.552\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n573\n00:32:55.552 --> 00:32:59.391\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\norganizational change management

00:00:08.017\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.017 --> 00:00:10.833\n[MUSIC]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching\n\n5\n00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:14.452\nITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode right\n\n6\n00:00:14.452 --> 00:00:15.435\nhere on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:18.204\nYou're watching organizational\nchange management.\n\n8\n00:00:18.204 --> 00:00:19.805\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:19.805 --> 00:00:24.118\nAnd today we're gonna be jumping in and\ntaking a look at, well, corporate culture.\n\n10\n00:00:24.118 --> 00:00:27.562\nAnd here to help us understand this\nconcept a bit better of course is\n\n11\n00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:30.776\ncommittee organizational\npotentate herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:30.776 --> 00:00:33.539\nJo, welcome back to the show,\nhow are you doing?\n\n13\n00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:34.557\n&gt;&gt; I think I was fine.\n\n14\n00:00:34.557 --> 00:00:35.188\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:35.188 --> 00:00:36.203\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Ronnie.\n\n16\n00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:39.246\nUntil I don't quite understand what\nthat means, is that a good thing or\n\n17\n00:00:39.246 --> 00:00:41.795\na bad thing?\n&gt;&gt; It's an awesome thing that's because\n\n18\n00:00:41.795 --> 00:00:42.821\nyou are awesome Jo.\n\n19\n00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:43.836\nSo here we go.\n\n20\n00:00:43.836 --> 00:00:47.490\nWe are now taking a look at\nthe idea of culture, yes.\n\n21\n00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.749\n&gt;&gt; I know, my head's getting bigger now.\n\n22\n00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:49.951\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome,\n\n23\n00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:51.830\ncause you deserve it, okay?\n\n24\n00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.300\nAll right, so Jo, we wanna take\na look at the idea of culture here.\n\n25\n00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.413\nHow does this fit into the idea of\norganizational change management?\n\n26\n00:00:58.413 --> 00:00:59.249\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well,\n\n27\n00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:03.570\nthe first thing that we've gotta accept\nis that in order to make a change at\n\n28\n00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.870\norganizational level, a big change,\n\n29\n00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.631\na transformational change is probably\ngoing to involve a change in our culture.\n\n30\n00:01:10.631 --> 00:01:15.101\nAnd so we're going to look at exactly how,\nwe looked in the previous episode that\n\n31\n00:01:15.101 --> 00:01:18.732\nthe emotional cycle of change and\nhow that affects individuals.\n\n32\n00:01:18.732 --> 00:01:23.467\nAnd what we're going to look at right now\nis how we can actually make that change\n\n33\n00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:25.930\nhappen to our organizational culture.\n\n34\n00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.410\nIf we're going to change the way\nthat we work as an organization,\n\n35\n00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.271\nif we're going to implement\na transformational change, then we have to\n\n36\n00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:37.095\nunderstand that we're gonna change\nthe culture of the organization.\n\n37\n00:01:37.095 --> 00:01:39.417\nWhat do I mean by culture?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n38\n00:01:39.417 --> 00:01:44.477\nwhen we start taking a look at this\nidea of culture what do we mean by it?\n\n39\n00:01:44.477 --> 00:01:47.275\nNormally what I think about\nof course is Language and\n\n40\n00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:51.287\ncustoms is what I normally think about.\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, there's an element of\n\n41\n00:01:51.287 --> 00:01:55.028\nthat, you're right, because culture\nis really about the way that we work.\n\n42\n00:01:55.028 --> 00:01:55.909\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n43\n00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.479\n&gt;&gt; It's about business as usual,\n\n44\n00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.692\nwhat does business as usual look like for\nus?\n\n45\n00:01:59.692 --> 00:02:03.317\nAnd it could be about language,\nit could be about time zones,\n\n46\n00:02:03.317 --> 00:02:06.533\nit could be about the country\nthat we're in right now.\n\n47\n00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:10.017\nI mean every single country\nhas different cultures.\n\n48\n00:02:10.017 --> 00:02:11.406\nEvery single country,\n\n49\n00:02:11.406 --> 00:02:15.165\nevery single organization has\ndifferent ways of doing things.\n\n50\n00:02:15.165 --> 00:02:18.967\nThere are things that are acceptable in\nsome organizations that aren't acceptable\n\n51\n00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:19.509\nin others.\n\n52\n00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:22.201\nThere are things that are acceptable\nin some parts of the world\n\n53\n00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:23.872\nthat aren't acceptable in all this.\n\n54\n00:02:23.872 --> 00:02:27.126\nSome words mean different things\nin some parts of the world.\n\n55\n00:02:27.126 --> 00:02:30.830\nSome of the words that I use mean\nsomething different to me than they do to\n\n56\n00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.843\nyou.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n57\n00:02:31.843 --> 00:02:34.556\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean I go down to a petrol\n\n58\n00:02:34.556 --> 00:02:37.570\nstation and I fill up a petrol.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n59\n00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.379\nI fill up with gasoline at a gas station,.\n\n60\n00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.066\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n61\n00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:45.130\nhe can't help it that he's wrong, right?\n&gt;&gt; There you\n\n62\n00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.728\ngo.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n63\n00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:50.323\nculture is actually just about the way\nthat we do things, that's what culture is.\n\n64\n00:02:50.323 --> 00:02:55.353\nAnd so\nwhen we are implementing change we have to\n\n65\n00:02:55.353 --> 00:03:00.145\nfirst of all understand\nwhat our culture is.\n\n66\n00:03:00.145 --> 00:03:05.059\nCulture can be something very simple\nlike whether we go to the gas station or\n\n67\n00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:07.480\nwhether we go to the petrol station.\n\n68\n00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.227\nAnd that's really simple, and\nI mean essentially it's the same thing,\n\n69\n00:03:11.227 --> 00:03:13.171\nwe just call it something different.\n\n70\n00:03:13.171 --> 00:03:17.431\nBut culture is all about our adaptability,\nand\n\n71\n00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:23.835\nabout our ability to accept change,\nand our ability to absorb change.\n\n72\n00:03:23.835 --> 00:03:29.531\nCulture is also about our attitudes, and\nabout our approaches to certain things.\n\n73\n00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:33.328\nOur attitudes to our customers and\nour approach is to them.\n\n74\n00:03:33.328 --> 00:03:38.682\nOur attitudes to the business and\nhow we interact with the business.\n\n75\n00:03:38.682 --> 00:03:41.385\nThat's all culture.\n\n76\n00:03:41.385 --> 00:03:46.314\nAnd when we implement any transformational\nchange, we have to do it in a way\n\n77\n00:03:46.314 --> 00:03:51.337\nthat is cognizant of what our culture is,\nand what we need our culture to be.\n\n78\n00:03:51.337 --> 00:03:54.412\nUltimately, I've already\nmentioned in previous episodes,\n\n79\n00:03:54.412 --> 00:03:57.206\neverybody is asking the question\nof what's in it for me.\n\n80\n00:03:57.206 --> 00:04:00.328\nAnd we've gotta be able to answer that.\n\n81\n00:04:00.328 --> 00:04:02.265\nHow is my life going to change?\n\n82\n00:04:02.265 --> 00:04:08.496\nHow is my culture going to change with\nthis particular transformational change?\n\n83\n00:04:08.496 --> 00:04:13.187\nSo we have something called\nthe change life cycle frame up.\n\n84\n00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:17.862\nNow, don't be alarmed by the mess\nthat you might see on the slide in\n\n85\n00:04:17.862 --> 00:04:19.541\nfront of you right now.\n\n86\n00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:24.161\nOkay, I know that it's scary but\nhere is the framework this came\n\n87\n00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:29.139\nfrom the PMI from the Project\nManagement Institute and you will see.\n\n88\n00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.868\nBut in order to get from,\nright across the top,\n\n89\n00:04:31.868 --> 00:04:36.316\nfrom my current state to our future state,\nwe have to go through these steps.\n\n90\n00:04:36.316 --> 00:04:42.266\nNow, to anybody who has never seen one\nbefore, this is a project Gantt chart.\n\n91\n00:04:42.266 --> 00:04:44.602\nYou seen a project Gantt chart before?\n&gt;&gt; I have.\n\n92\n00:04:44.602 --> 00:04:46.166\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and most people that,\n\n93\n00:04:46.166 --> 00:04:49.799\ncertainly, if you're studying for\nany sort of PMI accreditation,\n\n94\n00:04:49.799 --> 00:04:53.070\nthen I'm expecting you to be\nable to recognize a Gantt chart.\n\n95\n00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.644\nIf you can't, I'm gonna be\na little bit worried, all right?\n\n96\n00:04:56.644 --> 00:04:58.568\nI just wanna throw that out there.\n\n97\n00:04:58.568 --> 00:05:02.032\nBut most people within IT should\nbe able to recognize this.\n\n98\n00:05:02.032 --> 00:05:05.742\nAnd what this Gantt chart is\na set of sequential steps.\n\n99\n00:05:05.742 --> 00:05:08.942\nNow, I know a lot of people that\nwill organize this in spreadsheets,\n\n100\n00:05:08.942 --> 00:05:11.711\nthat will organize this in Excel or\nmaybe use in MS Project.\n\n101\n00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:15.498\nOr maybe other tools to\nbe able to display this.\n\n102\n00:05:15.498 --> 00:05:20.016\nBut essentially what we're looking\nat is we're looking at steps.\n\n103\n00:05:20.016 --> 00:05:21.918\nAnd over our next few episodes,\n\n104\n00:05:21.918 --> 00:05:26.222\nwhat we're going to do is we're going\nto go through each of these steps.\n\n105\n00:05:26.222 --> 00:05:29.453\nWe're gonna start off by\nformulating the change.\n\n106\n00:05:29.453 --> 00:05:33.358\nAnd then we're going through\nplanning over the change.\n\n107\n00:05:33.358 --> 00:05:37.215\nAnd then we're going through\nthe implementation of the change.\n\n108\n00:05:37.215 --> 00:05:41.855\nAnd then we're going through\nthe transition of the change.\n\n109\n00:05:41.855 --> 00:05:46.380\nImplementation is different to transition,\n\n110\n00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.302\nbecause transition is a gradual\nmove from the old to the new.\n\n111\n00:05:52.302 --> 00:05:55.801\nThe change has got to be transitioned.\n\n112\n00:05:55.801 --> 00:05:58.900\nYou don't just throw it over the fence.\n\n113\n00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:05.039\nAnd I say that and I say that quite\nemphatically because I hear this time and\n\n114\n00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:10.894\ntime again from service environments,\nfrom support environments.\n\n115\n00:06:10.894 --> 00:06:13.411\nWhere they come to me and\nthey'll say to me, you know what?\n\n116\n00:06:13.411 --> 00:06:17.103\nOur project team, they just\nthrough things over the fence and\n\n117\n00:06:17.103 --> 00:06:19.167\nthen we have to pick up the pieces.\n\n118\n00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:24.524\nAnd I hear this a lot, and I asked\none organization, not a lot long ago,\n\n119\n00:06:24.524 --> 00:06:28.649\nI asked them bout how DevOps\nwas in that organization?\n\n120\n00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:31.716\nAnd they said to me,\nyeah it works really, really great.\n\n121\n00:06:31.716 --> 00:06:35.761\nWe have an excellent hand over procedure.\n\n122\n00:06:35.761 --> 00:06:40.246\nThat's not DevOps,\nthat's not a transition.\n\n123\n00:06:40.246 --> 00:06:44.750\nA hand over procedure is me\ngiving this to Ronnie and\n\n124\n00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:51.158\nsaying to Ronnie there you go,\nit's yours, that's not a transition.\n\n125\n00:06:51.158 --> 00:06:54.854\nA transition or\na DevOps is actually me saying to Ronnie,\n\n126\n00:06:54.854 --> 00:06:57.527\nhere, I've got this to give to you.\n\n127\n00:06:57.527 --> 00:07:02.017\nBy the way, I want to draw your attention\nto this, and to this, and to this.\n\n128\n00:07:02.017 --> 00:07:06.809\nAnd if you've got any questions,\nI'm gonna be right here and\n\n129\n00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:13.465\nI'm gonna be answering them for you for\nthe first few months, that's a transition.\n\n130\n00:07:13.465 --> 00:07:17.077\nThere is a huge difference\nbetween a transition and\n\n131\n00:07:17.077 --> 00:07:19.345\nhandover, a huge difference.\n\n132\n00:07:19.345 --> 00:07:23.493\nAnd with any organizational change,\nwe don't just have a handover,\n\n133\n00:07:23.493 --> 00:07:25.473\nwe have to have that transition.\n\n134\n00:07:25.473 --> 00:07:30.093\nYou will see that the arrows\nstart quite early on during\n\n135\n00:07:30.093 --> 00:07:33.721\nthe implementation where we transition.\n\n136\n00:07:33.721 --> 00:07:36.993\nThe other thing that happens\nright at the very bottom there,\n\n137\n00:07:36.993 --> 00:07:40.020\nyou've got that section that\ncalls sustained change.\n\n138\n00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.437\nFrom a previous episode, we looked at\nCarter's eight steps to transformational\n\n139\n00:07:44.437 --> 00:07:47.133\nchange and\nwe talked about embedding the change.\n\n140\n00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:51.405\nWell, we also call that\nsustaining the change.\n\n141\n00:07:51.405 --> 00:07:56.158\nIn other words, the change has\nto be accepted as a way of life.\n\n142\n00:07:56.158 --> 00:07:57.683\nAnd the reason why it starts so\n\n143\n00:07:57.683 --> 00:08:01.039\nearly on, you'll notice that\nthe arrows start quite a way back,\n\n144\n00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:04.841\nin fact they start at exactly the same\ntime as we're planning the change.\n\n145\n00:08:04.841 --> 00:08:10.690\nAnd the reason why Is because we are\npromoting the change from that moment on.\n\n146\n00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:15.235\nWe're promoting that we're planning\nany change, we are promoting that\n\n147\n00:08:15.235 --> 00:08:19.276\nthere is a new change coming,\nwe are communicating this change.\n\n148\n00:08:19.276 --> 00:08:24.191\nWe're asking for feedback because\nthat feedback will give us buy-in.\n\n149\n00:08:24.191 --> 00:08:27.230\nAnd if we get the buy-in from\nall of our stake holders,\n\n150\n00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.665\nfrom all of those that are going to be,\nnot just involved, but\n\n151\n00:08:30.665 --> 00:08:34.587\nare going to be affected by the change,\nremember those individuals.\n\n152\n00:08:34.587 --> 00:08:40.357\nIf we get that buy-in, then actually\nit will help us to embed the change.\n\n153\n00:08:40.357 --> 00:08:47.049\nIt will help us to ensure that the change\nis successful, and that change will stick.\n\n154\n00:08:47.049 --> 00:08:50.412\nThis is why things like\nthe emotional cycle have changed.\n\n155\n00:08:50.412 --> 00:08:55.377\nThis is why Carter's eight steps\nto transformational change is so\n\n156\n00:08:55.377 --> 00:09:01.863\nimportant because if we ignore the people,\nthe change isn't going to be successful.\n\n157\n00:09:01.863 --> 00:09:06.599\nSo over the next few episodes then,\nwhat we're going to do is we're going to\n\n158\n00:09:06.599 --> 00:09:09.707\nspend time looking at each\none of these sections,\n\n159\n00:09:09.707 --> 00:09:12.967\nwe're going to look at how\nwe formulate the change.\n\n160\n00:09:12.967 --> 00:09:15.868\nAnd then how we plan for the change,\n\n161\n00:09:15.868 --> 00:09:20.529\nhow we implement it and\nthen how we transition it as well.\n\n162\n00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:22.933\nAs I've said, it's not just a hand over.\n\n163\n00:09:22.933 --> 00:09:27.040\nAnd I love that arrow there,\nthe one that says need for time.\n\n164\n00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.368\nIt has to happen over time.\n\n165\n00:09:29.368 --> 00:09:32.281\nIt's not just a simple handover.\n\n166\n00:09:32.281 --> 00:09:37.367\nAnd then, we're going to look at also,\nsustaining the change,\n\n167\n00:09:37.367 --> 00:09:42.555\nand how we make the change stick or\nrather we make it our way of life.\n\n168\n00:09:44.669 --> 00:09:49.652\nSo in terms of then our next episode,\nwhat we're going to do in our next\n\n169\n00:09:49.652 --> 00:09:54.133\nepisode is we're going to be\nlooking then at this first stage.\n\n170\n00:09:54.133 --> 00:09:57.818\nAnd that first stage is actually\nformulating their change.\n\n171\n00:09:57.818 --> 00:10:01.001\nSo I'm gonna invite you to come back and\n\n172\n00:10:01.001 --> 00:10:05.729\ntake a look at our next episode\nwhere we launch ourselves on\n\n173\n00:10:05.729 --> 00:10:09.800\nthis life cycle of change.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well, thank you for\n\n174\n00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.903\nhelping us to understand a little bit more\nabout the idea of what corporate culture\n\n175\n00:10:13.903 --> 00:10:16.757\nmeans and the acceptance of\nthis to implement the ideas of\n\n176\n00:10:16.757 --> 00:10:18.559\nchange that we have to be able to do.\n\n177\n00:10:18.559 --> 00:10:21.524\nAnd that means there is more\nto come as we start taking,\n\n178\n00:10:21.524 --> 00:10:24.497\nwe go the process or\nthe life cycle of changing as well.\n\n179\n00:10:24.497 --> 00:10:26.985\nSo we're gonna have that for\nanother episode.\n\n180\n00:10:26.985 --> 00:10:31.341\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n181\n00:10:31.341 --> 00:10:32.266\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n182\n00:10:32.266 --> 00:10:33.316\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right for\n\n183\n00:10:33.316 --> 00:10:35.856\nmore organizational\nchange management shows.\n\n184\n00:10:35.856 --> 00:10:43.376\n[MUSIC]\n\n185\n00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:46.678\n&gt;&gt; Thank you

You're watching ITPRO TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome\n\n4\n00:00:13.094 --> 00:00:15.823\nto another great episode\nright here on ITPRO TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.823 --> 00:00:19.000\nYou're watching the organizational\nchange management show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.754\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n7\n00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:23.547\ntoday we're going to take\na look at strategic change.\n\n8\n00:00:23.547 --> 00:00:26.432\nAnd this means we need somebody\nto help lead us down this path,\n\n9\n00:00:26.432 --> 00:00:28.099\nto understand a little bit better.\n\n10\n00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.614\nAnd that means we're going to have to\ndepend on our strategic change engineer\n\n11\n00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:33.190\nherself, Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.030\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.515\nI have to say,\nthough I am incredibly impressed.\n\n14\n00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:41.020\n&gt;&gt; What are you impressed by here?\n\n15\n00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.444\n&gt;&gt; Well, I am impressed by your use of\n\n16\n00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:47.313\nsynonyms and adjectives.\n&gt;&gt; I do\n\n17\n00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:50.127\nhave a powerful vocabulary.\n&gt;&gt; Sort of worried about what's coming\n\n18\n00:00:50.127 --> 00:00:50.804\nnext.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n19\n00:00:50.804 --> 00:00:54.133\nI do have a powerful vocabulary but the\nvery fact is I get to rely on Google, so\n\n20\n00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.953\nit actually helps a bit more when\nI could do something like this.\n\n21\n00:00:56.953 --> 00:00:57.900\n&gt;&gt; He's letting out all his secrets now,\n\n22\n00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.035\nthat's so disappointing.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n23\n00:00:59.035 --> 00:01:02.820\nthere is no magic behind this wizard,\nI guarantee you.\n\n24\n00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.612\nSo here we go, we are talking about\nthe ideas of strategic change Jo, so where\n\n25\n00:01:07.612 --> 00:01:12.349\nare we going to be talking about here?\n&gt;&gt; Well, before we get into strategic\n\n26\n00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:17.455\nchange and before we start talking about\nchange at an organizational level,\n\n27\n00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:22.027\nand transformational change that\naffects an entire organization.\n\n28\n00:01:22.027 --> 00:01:25.410\nI was asked a couple of\nquestions actually, well,\n\n29\n00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.170\nin between episodes, to be honest.\n\n30\n00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.714\nAnd I thought I really want to take\nthe opportunity to answer the questions,\n\n31\n00:01:32.714 --> 00:01:35.412\nbecause if somebody is\nasking me a question,\n\n32\n00:01:35.412 --> 00:01:39.470\nthen that means that you're probably\nthinking the same question.\n\n33\n00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.056\nSo I wonder what that first question was.\n&gt;&gt; [COUGH] I\n\n34\n00:01:44.056 --> 00:01:47.935\nhave a question.\n&gt;&gt; Go on then.\n\n35\n00:01:47.935 --> 00:01:50.782\n&gt;&gt; So who is it that requests change?\n\n36\n00:01:50.782 --> 00:01:52.870\n&gt;&gt; Who requests change?\n\n37\n00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.101\nWell, absolutely anybody.\n\n38\n00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:55.910\nThere you go.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n39\n00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.158\n&gt;&gt; That answers the question, right?\n\n40\n00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:58.557\n&gt;&gt; Awesome answer there, Jo, awesome.\n\n41\n00:01:58.557 --> 00:02:00.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n42\n00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.887\n&gt;&gt; That was\n\n43\n00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:02.200\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely anybody.\n\n44\n00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.368\nAll right, yeah, and\nI wasn't being sort of blase about it.\n\n45\n00:02:06.368 --> 00:02:10.549\nOkay, yes, I was, but\nthat's not the point the [LAUGH] fact is\n\n46\n00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.620\nthat absolutely anybody\ncan request a change.\n\n47\n00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.162\nI've said in a previous episode that\na change is an opportunity to improve.\n\n48\n00:02:19.162 --> 00:02:22.282\nAnd we implement changes\nbecause we want to improve,\n\n49\n00:02:22.282 --> 00:02:27.010\nwe want things to get better and you know\nwhat anybody can have an idea to improve.\n\n50\n00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.638\nAnybody can have an idea\nto make things better, and\n\n51\n00:02:31.638 --> 00:02:35.711\nthat means that absolutely\nanybody can request a change.\n\n52\n00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:40.374\nNow, I'm gonna bring in\na little word of warning\n\n53\n00:02:40.374 --> 00:02:44.894\nwith this though.\n&gt;&gt; Do you know what the most bypassed\n\n54\n00:02:44.894 --> 00:02:49.582\nprocess is in the whole of IT?\n&gt;&gt; I do not\n\n55\n00:02:49.582 --> 00:02:50.614\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n56\n00:02:50.614 --> 00:02:51.733\nI'll give you a clue.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n57\n00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:53.302\n&gt;&gt; We're on a change management show,\n\n58\n00:02:53.302 --> 00:02:54.281\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n59\n00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:54.786\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n60\n00:02:54.786 --> 00:02:57.639\nthen it'll be?\n&gt;&gt; Change management.\n\n61\n00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.298\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, see, look, he's getting there,\n\n62\n00:02:59.298 --> 00:03:00.260\nhe's getting there.\n\n63\n00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.313\nI actually quite like\nthe voice from above.\n\n64\n00:03:02.313 --> 00:03:05.251\nI just wanna say that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, better than mine,\n\n65\n00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:07.528\nI understand.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm just saying.\n\n66\n00:03:07.528 --> 00:03:09.430\n&gt;&gt; Me too, that's what I'm saying too.\n\n67\n00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.992\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, the change management is the\n\n68\n00:03:11.992 --> 00:03:14.936\nmost bypass process in the whole of IT.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n69\n00:03:14.936 --> 00:03:17.394\n&gt;&gt; Simply because that very much in\n\n70\n00:03:17.394 --> 00:03:20.945\noperational level and\nunder tactical level,\n\n71\n00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:24.506\nit can be perceived as\ntoo bureaucratic even.\n\n72\n00:03:24.506 --> 00:03:28.652\nAnd if we have too much bureaucracy\nin to change management,\n\n73\n00:03:28.652 --> 00:03:33.446\nwe have to have a degree of rigidity,\nwe have to have consistency, but\n\n74\n00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:37.268\nif we add too much bureaucracy\ninto change management,\n\n75\n00:03:37.268 --> 00:03:42.253\npeople will find a way around it.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n76\n00:03:42.253 --> 00:03:43.969\n&gt;&gt; Those people that say right,\n\n77\n00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:47.952\nI'd like this particular change,\nit's gonna be too much hassle for\n\n78\n00:03:47.952 --> 00:03:52.160\nme to document this change, so\nI'm just going to implement the change.\n\n79\n00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.660\nAnd we know people that do that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n80\n00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.165\n&gt;&gt; In fact,\n\n81\n00:03:56.165 --> 00:04:00.595\nthat little voice that happened just a\nlittle while ago, yeah, yeah, you know who\n\n82\n00:04:00.595 --> 00:04:03.684\nyou are, you're watching, you're guilty.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n83\n00:04:03.684 --> 00:04:06.916\n&gt;&gt; Point that one out.\n\n84\n00:04:06.916 --> 00:04:08.639\nI'm guilty too.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n85\n00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm guilty of this one too.\n\n86\n00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.522\nAnd this is a problem within IT is\nactually we're all guilty, okay, and\n\n87\n00:04:14.522 --> 00:04:16.816\nwe can have a bit of\na confession moment here.\n\n88\n00:04:16.816 --> 00:04:21.575\nSo in terms of who can request the change,\nwell absolutely anybody can request\n\n89\n00:04:21.575 --> 00:04:25.252\nthe change, but in terms of who\nthen implements the change,\n\n90\n00:04:25.252 --> 00:04:28.940\nwhich is another question\nthat's quite often asked.\n\n91\n00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.540\nWell the person that implements\nthe change should be the person\n\n92\n00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.893\nthat is the most skilled at\nthat particular type of change.\n\n93\n00:04:37.893 --> 00:04:43.028\nSo somebody who would implement a change\nto say a Windows server, for instance,\n\n94\n00:04:43.028 --> 00:04:47.877\nwould be somebody who is the most skilled\nat that particular type of change.\n\n95\n00:04:47.877 --> 00:04:53.350\nBut what about the person that implements\nchange then at the strategic level?\n\n96\n00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.557\nCuz that's what we've been talking about\nso far up until now, we're talking about\n\n97\n00:04:57.557 --> 00:05:01.367\ntransformational change,\nwe're talking about organizational change.\n\n98\n00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:06.197\nSo who implements that?\n&gt;&gt; In terms of the strategic change,\n\n99\n00:05:06.197 --> 00:05:10.850\nit would have to be somebody that wants\nto align the idea of whatever technical\n\n100\n00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.570\nchallenges that we have\nto the business goals\n\n101\n00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.287\nthat we have in line.\n&gt;&gt; Think back to one of our previous\n\n102\n00:05:16.287 --> 00:05:16.898\nepisodes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n103\n00:05:16.898 --> 00:05:20.232\nIf we actually looked in one\nof our previous episodes,\n\n104\n00:05:20.232 --> 00:05:22.930\nwe looked at the governance layer.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n105\n00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.774\nThe governance, the strategic board or\nthe steering committee, if you want to\n\n106\n00:05:27.774 --> 00:05:30.779\ncall them that, and also our sponsors.\n&gt;&gt; Sponsor\n\n107\n00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:33.432\n&gt;&gt; And it's our governance board that will\n\n108\n00:05:33.432 --> 00:05:37.879\ndirect the change, but underneath\nthat we had an orange layer, and\n\n109\n00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:43.440\nthe orange layer included the implementors\nand included the leaders of the change.\n\n110\n00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.403\nAnd these are the people that\nactually implement the change.\n\n111\n00:05:47.403 --> 00:05:49.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n112\n00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.136\n&gt;&gt; So let's get back on track for\n\n113\n00:05:51.136 --> 00:05:56.039\na moment then now, because now we've\ntalked about who can request a change,\n\n114\n00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.238\nand who would implement a change.\n\n115\n00:05:58.238 --> 00:06:02.130\nWe're gonna just ask the question,\nreally, why change?\n\n116\n00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.124\nWell, I am asking a question,\nwhy do we need to change?\n\n117\n00:06:07.124 --> 00:06:10.054\n&gt;&gt; We need to improve on something.\n\n118\n00:06:10.054 --> 00:06:11.022\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so\n\n119\n00:06:11.022 --> 00:06:15.710\ngive me an example then of an organization\nthat you think changes a lot.\n\n120\n00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.602\nAn organization that changes a lot.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n121\n00:06:18.602 --> 00:06:23.938\nWho changes a lot, frequently?\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say Apple,\n\n122\n00:06:23.938 --> 00:06:25.919\ncuz you love Apple.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n123\n00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.701\nYeah, I know, cuz I love Apple.\n\n124\n00:06:27.701 --> 00:06:31.969\n[LAUGH] It's better than loving that\nconsole TV that's still set in the corner\n\n125\n00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:34.850\nof the living room, isn't it Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; That Zenith is\n\n126\n00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:35.676\nstill working.\n\n127\n00:06:35.676 --> 00:06:38.181\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n128\n00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:38.727\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n129\n00:06:38.727 --> 00:06:40.261\n&gt;&gt; Most tech [LAUGH] organizations,\n\n130\n00:06:40.261 --> 00:06:42.100\nI'm just not going there again.\n\n131\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.050\nMost tech organizations change frequently.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n132\n00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.772\n&gt;&gt; And, I mean,\n\n133\n00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:47.344\nwe don't just mention Apple.\n\n134\n00:06:47.344 --> 00:06:51.273\nBut you mentioned, sort of,\nthink of your cell phone providers,\n\n135\n00:06:51.273 --> 00:06:54.580\nthink of Samsung and Google,\nthey change frequently.\n\n136\n00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.661\nThey change their models frequently.\n\n137\n00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:59.230\nLet's think about your laptop providers.\n\n138\n00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.512\nAgain, they change frequently.\n\n139\n00:07:01.512 --> 00:07:06.560\nAnd so, these tech organizations,\nthey have a lot of change.\n\n140\n00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.782\nWe also have a lot of organizations around\nthe world that have a lot of change and\n\n141\n00:07:11.782 --> 00:07:13.626\nhave to adapt to a lot of change as well.\n\n142\n00:07:13.626 --> 00:07:16.680\nThink about financial organizations.\n\n143\n00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.008\nYou might like to think of them as\na bit old fashioned and a bit staid.\n\n144\n00:07:20.008 --> 00:07:24.562\nAnd in certain respects they are but\nthere are change in regulations well,\n\n145\n00:07:24.562 --> 00:07:27.392\nalmost every week it\nwould seem at the moment.\n\n146\n00:07:27.392 --> 00:07:30.142\nI mean think about the security\nimplications as well for\n\n147\n00:07:30.142 --> 00:07:31.980\nany financial organization.\n\n148\n00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:37.148\nSecurity requirements change on almost\na weekly basis at the moment too.\n\n149\n00:07:37.148 --> 00:07:41.151\nSo most organizations now if\nthey've got some form of tech,\n\n150\n00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:46.180\nif they've got some IT then they are going\nto be subject to frequent change.\n\n151\n00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:52.691\nSo we probably want to use Agile\ntype methodologies to help\n\n152\n00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:57.508\nus absorb and\nto help us manage that frequent change.\n\n153\n00:07:57.508 --> 00:08:01.907\nIf we don't have a process,\nAnd every single change is\n\n154\n00:08:01.907 --> 00:08:07.230\nplanned completely independently\nof any of the others.\n\n155\n00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:12.450\nAnd we don't accommodate frequent change,\nthen what happens\n\n156\n00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:18.350\nis the well our organization kinda lags\nbehind everybody else, let's face it.\n\n157\n00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.462\nIf Apple for instance were able to\nrelease a new version of their cellphone\n\n158\n00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:28.311\nevery six months,\nwhich they probably are in all fairness.\n\n159\n00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:32.866\nBut if they were able to really said\nevery six months, and Samsung could only\n\n160\n00:08:32.866 --> 00:08:37.375\nrelease one every five years, who do\nyou think would be the market leader?\n\n161\n00:08:37.375 --> 00:08:38.452\n&gt;&gt; It will be Apple.\n\n162\n00:08:38.452 --> 00:08:39.369\n&gt;&gt; It will be Apple,\n\n163\n00:08:39.369 --> 00:08:43.653\nright, because there's always gonna be\nthese early adopters that we talked about\n\n164\n00:08:43.653 --> 00:08:47.199\nyou know the people like me,\nthe ones that are gonna stand in a queue,\n\n165\n00:08:47.199 --> 00:08:50.600\n[LAUGH] outside an Apple store and\nwait for the latest toy to come.\n\n166\n00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.532\nBut the fact of the matter is,\nthat if Samsung don't keep up with Apple,\n\n167\n00:08:54.532 --> 00:08:56.020\nthen Samsung fall behind.\n\n168\n00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:00.932\nSo if Samsung is an organization\nunable to absorb frequent change,\n\n169\n00:09:00.932 --> 00:09:04.120\nthen they are going to fall behind.\n\n170\n00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.523\nNow what they may think, and this is\nwhere strategic change is very important,\n\n171\n00:09:08.523 --> 00:09:11.743\nbecause, we have three different\ntypes of strategy, and\n\n172\n00:09:11.743 --> 00:09:13.860\nI'm gonna come onto that in a second.\n\n173\n00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.075\nBut you see, we may think that\nan organization that just simply wants to\n\n174\n00:09:18.075 --> 00:09:23.600\nmaintain the status quo, and just wants to\nstay stagnant, we may think, that's okay.\n\n175\n00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.660\nThey're just staying stagnant and\nthey're just treading water for\n\n176\n00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:30.820\nnow, and things will carry on,\nsort of ticking over as they should do.\n\n177\n00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.900\nYeah, but that's not what happens,\n\n178\n00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:38.290\nbecause all of the competitors go\nsteaming ahead, and we end up way behind.\n\n179\n00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.592\nWe have three different strategies,\nreally,\n\n180\n00:09:41.592 --> 00:09:44.259\nthat we take from the business\nthat we use here within IT.\n\n181\n00:09:44.259 --> 00:09:49.361\nAnd those strategies are, and\nwe've got some acronyms for\n\n182\n00:09:49.361 --> 00:09:53.646\nthem as well,\ncuz we do like an acronym here in IT,\n\n183\n00:09:53.646 --> 00:09:57.398\nwe have RTB GTB and TTB, really simple.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n184\n00:09:57.398 --> 00:09:59.634\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No they are really simple and\n\n185\n00:09:59.634 --> 00:10:04.026\none is run the business,\nthe other is grow the business, and then,\n\n186\n00:10:04.026 --> 00:10:06.740\nthe third one is transform the business.\n\n187\n00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:13.140\nAn organization that just wants\nto run the business I say just.\n\n188\n00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.141\nBut, actually this is quite\na common strategy for\n\n189\n00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:18.720\norganizations that grow really rapidly.\n\n190\n00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.039\nThen a common strategy is to grow\nvery rapidly for say, 18 months,\n\n191\n00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:28.026\nand then to settle where they are for\nsix months, just to embed the new culture,\n\n192\n00:10:28.026 --> 00:10:32.060\nand then they engage in\na period of rapid growth again.\n\n193\n00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:36.830\nSo, RTB is called Run the Business, and\nthat is simply maintaining the status quo.\n\n194\n00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:42.250\nSo, not making any strategic change to the\norganization during that period of time.\n\n195\n00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.997\nWe use that to embed new changes,\nand to embed very,\n\n196\n00:10:47.997 --> 00:10:52.446\nsort of dramatic changes,\ntransformational changes.\n\n197\n00:10:52.446 --> 00:10:56.905\nThere is a danger though, that if we\nstay in an RTB mode for too long,\n\n198\n00:10:56.905 --> 00:11:00.620\nthere's a danger that we\nstart to fall behind.\n\n199\n00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:05.754\nEspecially if we're in a tech environment\nand there's a big danger of that.\n\n200\n00:11:05.754 --> 00:11:10.399\nAnd then you've got grow the business,\nand grow the business is the strategy\n\n201\n00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:14.974\nwhere we want to grow, but we want to\ngrow within our existing marketplace,\n\n202\n00:11:14.974 --> 00:11:17.495\nwithin in our existing industry sector.\n\n203\n00:11:18.855 --> 00:11:22.991\nSo growing the business is really\nwhat most organizations aspire to,\n\n204\n00:11:22.991 --> 00:11:26.380\nthey want to grow they want\nto become more profitable.\n\n205\n00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.480\nWhich means that,\ndepending on the sector that you're in,\n\n206\n00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:36.230\nthen we want to use agile-based principles\nin order to change on a regular basis.\n\n207\n00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:42.819\nAnd then we also got the organization\nthat wants to transform.\n\n208\n00:11:42.819 --> 00:11:46.980\nAnd this is where we're gonna be really\nexplicit about this because transformation\n\n209\n00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.450\nmeans stepping outside\nof your industry sector.\n\n210\n00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.697\nSo for instance what do we do?\n&gt;&gt; What we do is\n\n211\n00:11:53.697 --> 00:11:55.978\ntraining.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n212\n00:11:55.978 --> 00:11:59.174\nit's binge worthy TV that's we do right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n213\n00:11:59.174 --> 00:11:59.738\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n214\n00:11:59.738 --> 00:12:03.316\nwhat we're doing essentially is\nwe're imparting our knowledge or\n\n215\n00:12:03.316 --> 00:12:06.590\nnot in the case as some of us,\ncuz we don't have all that much.\n\n216\n00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.917\nBut anyway, what we're doing is\nwe're imparting what we know,\n\n217\n00:12:09.917 --> 00:12:11.680\nwe're imparting our knowledge.\n\n218\n00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:17.392\nBut what if all of a sudden we decided one\nday that we were going to, I don't know,\n\n219\n00:12:17.392 --> 00:12:22.600\nwe were gonna go outside, and we were\ngoing to open up a string of I was gonna\n\n220\n00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.766\nsay petrol fore courts but gas stations.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n221\n00:12:25.766 --> 00:12:28.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that would be growing outside our\n\n222\n00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:32.520\nindustry sector, so\nthat's when we would call transformation.\n\n223\n00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:37.630\nTransformational change is very risky,\n\n224\n00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.610\nwhich is why transformational\nchange has to be managed.\n\n225\n00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:46.250\nAnd so transformational change\nmay reap huge benefits.\n\n226\n00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.150\n&gt;&gt; But it's going to be a big,\n\n227\n00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:53.270\nwell I used the words in\nprevious episodes, upheaval.\n\n228\n00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.653\nIt's gonna be risk to\nthe existing organization,\n\n229\n00:12:56.653 --> 00:12:59.020\nso this is why we've gotta plan it.\n\n230\n00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:04.240\nYou can not just suddenly decide to\nmake a change, it's okay with small\n\n231\n00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:10.424\noperational changes but it's not very\ngood with large transformational changes.\n\n232\n00:13:10.424 --> 00:13:15.100\nBut then let's get back to agile again\nlet's get back to that frequent change.\n\n233\n00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:19.865\nBecause if we want to\ntransform our organization and\n\n234\n00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:22.510\nwe want to move into\na different market sector.\n\n235\n00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:27.120\nWe've got to be really careful\nof our existing market sector.\n\n236\n00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.475\nWhat do we do with our\nexisted organization?\n\n237\n00:13:31.475 --> 00:13:35.425\nLet's just say for instance, that here\nwe are, we are delivering training.\n\n238\n00:13:35.425 --> 00:13:40.560\nOkay, that's what we are doing right now\nand all of a sudden, Tim decides that he\n\n239\n00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.830\nwants to move into gas stations or petrol\nforecot whatever you want to call them.\n\n240\n00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.965\nHe wants to move into gas stations,\nhe has got to be incredibly careful.\n\n241\n00:13:49.965 --> 00:13:57.045\nBecause the temptation is to focus all\nof our efforts onto the new endeavor.\n\n242\n00:13:57.045 --> 00:14:01.230\nIt's to focus all of our efforts\nonto the transformation.\n\n243\n00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.000\nAnd then what happens to\npeople like you and me?\n\n244\n00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.520\nWe kinda get forgotten about, right?\n&gt;&gt; Feel left behind.\n\n245\n00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.956\n&gt;&gt; And if we feel left behind and\n\n246\n00:14:08.956 --> 00:14:12.808\nwe get forgotten about, then we're not\ngonna be too happy here, and guess what?\n\n247\n00:14:12.808 --> 00:14:17.870\nIt's the quality of work that you get\nthat's going to suffer because of that.\n\n248\n00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:24.340\nAnd it's the quality of what we're\ndelivering is going to suffer to you,\n\n249\n00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.890\nthen we may lose you as a customer.\n\n250\n00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:34.870\nSo transformational change has got to be\nplanned just as much as any other change.\n\n251\n00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.493\nIf not more so,\nyou might want to consider, but\n\n252\n00:14:37.493 --> 00:14:42.490\nwe also have to consider business as usual\nand how we maintain business as usual.\n\n253\n00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.350\nAnd so we may want to,\nfor the business as usual,\n\n254\n00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:48.620\njust run the business just\nrun our organization.\n\n255\n00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.430\nWell, yes, okay that's fine, but\neven then that's subject to change.\n\n256\n00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:57.221\nI mean let's face it, just to maintain\nthe status quo, Windows 95 isn't gonna be\n\n257\n00:14:57.221 --> 00:14:59.764\naround forever right?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's not.\n\n258\n00:14:59.764 --> 00:15:01.238\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right exactly,\n\n259\n00:15:01.238 --> 00:15:06.052\nalthough some old console tv's that\nsit in the corner of living room are.\n\n260\n00:15:06.052 --> 00:15:06.766\n&gt;&gt; They still will be,\n\n261\n00:15:06.766 --> 00:15:09.712\nthat's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And they still will be until\n\n262\n00:15:09.712 --> 00:15:12.670\nthat thing blows up in flames.\n&gt;&gt; That is correct.\n\n263\n00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.447\n&gt;&gt; They will still be there.\n\n264\n00:15:14.447 --> 00:15:19.377\nSo transformational change,\nthen, has to be managed without\n\n265\n00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:23.841\nneglecting what we already\nhave as an organization, and\n\n266\n00:15:23.841 --> 00:15:28.130\nwe still have to pay attention\nto what we already have.\n\n267\n00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:31.784\nYou're looking very pensive there, Ronnie.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n268\n00:15:31.784 --> 00:15:36.129\nI'm just trying to consider everything\nthat we're talking about here, the idea of\n\n269\n00:15:36.129 --> 00:15:40.510\nhow this fits into the strategy as we\nstart to implement this idea of change.\n\n270\n00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.645\nAnd how we keep things in the way\nthat they are and that and\n\n271\n00:15:43.645 --> 00:15:48.147\nthen if we wanna move transformationally,\nhow we keep the balance of all that.\n\n272\n00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:48.764\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n273\n00:15:48.764 --> 00:15:52.949\nStanford University came up with\nsomething quite clever actually, and\n\n274\n00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:57.410\nit's called the Strategic Execution\nFramework, and there's a nice pretty\n\n275\n00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:02.230\npicture of that strategic execution\nframework right there, look at that, nice.\n\n276\n00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:06.290\nOn that strategic execution framework,\nyou'll see that we've got certain things\n\n277\n00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:11.360\nthat are sort of mapped out and\ndivided up, and\n\n278\n00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.415\nyou can see if we can blow that up full\nscreen so that my eyes can see it as well.\n\n279\n00:16:15.415 --> 00:16:19.180\n[LAUGH] Because that font is quite small,\n\n280\n00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:23.860\nyou can see right at the very top in\nthe green we've got the ideation.\n\n281\n00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.840\nThat's the idea.\n\n282\n00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:31.600\nThat's that new idea that we've got, we're\ngonna open some gas stations, that's our\n\n283\n00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:37.250\nnew idea, and it is so easy for an\norganization to focus everything in there.\n\n284\n00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.750\nAnd forget about the business as usual,\nand\n\n285\n00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.380\nthe ideation is where we\ntalk about the purpose.\n\n286\n00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.650\nIt's where we talk about\nthe identity of the organization.\n\n287\n00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:50.460\nThe purpose of the change, and\nwhat the long-term intention is.\n\n288\n00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.500\nBut you'll notice that that long\nterm intention feeds into our goals,\n\n289\n00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.430\nwhich is our vision for the change.\n\n290\n00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.130\nNow, vision for the future.\n\n291\n00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:03.290\nBut the identity feeds into\nwhat we call our nature.\n\n292\n00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:08.220\nAnd our nature is the culture and\nthe structure of the organization.\n\n293\n00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:13.167\nIf you remember in a previous episode,\nwe talked about,\n\n294\n00:17:13.167 --> 00:17:18.840\nwell we talked about how culture\nwould help us grow change.\n\n295\n00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.890\nAnd that fact that if we didn't have the\nright culture then change was never gonna\n\n296\n00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:23.080\nbe successful.\n\n297\n00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.670\nOur culture had to be adaptable.\n\n298\n00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.430\nAnd our culture had to be sort\nof welcoming of change and\n\n299\n00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:30.910\nnot resistant of change.\n\n300\n00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.680\nSo, right away,\nat the very start, that ideation,\n\n301\n00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.980\nwe're thinking about identity and we're\n\n302\n00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:43.020\nas to whether our existing organization\nwould be able to handle that change.\n\n303\n00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.440\nSo we separate that out.\n\n304\n00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.300\nWe separate the nature from the vision.\n\n305\n00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.770\nBecause just because we have a vision for\n\n306\n00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:55.980\na change, doesn't mean that that\nchange is going to be successful.\n\n307\n00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:00.280\nWithout the culture that's\ngoing to implement the change,\n\n308\n00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.170\nit's not gonna be successful.\n\n309\n00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.310\nAnd then you'll see, there's\nan orange part in the middle there.\n\n310\n00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.570\nAnd that's called engagement.\n\n311\n00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:10.677\nAnd that engagement looks at\nthe strategy and the portfolio.\n\n312\n00:18:10.677 --> 00:18:15.550\nThe strategy is the strategy for\nus in IT and the strategy for\n\n313\n00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:21.310\nthat change and how that feeds into\na portfolio, our a portfolio of projects.\n\n314\n00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:26.820\nAnd then, of course, underneath that,\nthat's our synthesis.\n\n315\n00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:31.020\nThat's bringing it all together and\nunderstanding what to put well,\n\n316\n00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:35.740\nwhat would be considered a program,\nwhich is a number of related projects.\n\n317\n00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.830\nAnd what's an individual project.\n\n318\n00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.890\nAnd how is that feed into\nthe prioritization of our portfolio.\n\n319\n00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.550\nIn other words, what else is out there.\n\n320\n00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.030\nThis is where we start\nthinking in that strategy and\n\n321\n00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.020\nportfolio part, the engagement.\n\n322\n00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.060\nThis is where we have to start\nthinking about what else we're doing.\n\n323\n00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:58.010\nYou see, right up in the green,\nin the strategy part, the ideation,\n\n324\n00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:03.290\nwe've come up with the idea that we want\nto move into petrol filling stations, or\n\n325\n00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:06.840\ngas stations, whatever we want.\n\n326\n00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.356\nI just get confused.\n\n327\n00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:10.200\nWe just-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n328\n00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:10.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n329\n00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:11.920\nThat'll do, right.\n\n330\n00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.450\nThat's what we're sticking with.\n\n331\n00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:14.890\nWe've decided.\n\n332\n00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:17.290\nSo we want to move into that area.\n\n333\n00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.870\nThat idea came up in the green.\n\n334\n00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:25.830\nNow what we're working on in that orange,\nin the engagement with the strategy and\n\n335\n00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.720\nthe portfolio,\nis looking at the portfolio and\n\n336\n00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:32.130\nseeing how that would fit\nin with our other ideas.\n\n337\n00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.750\nNot necessarily how that would fit in\nwith our ways of working right now with\n\n338\n00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:40.230\nour business as usual, cuz we looked\nat that in our nature and our vision.\n\n339\n00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:44.910\nWhat we're doing here is seeing how\nthis would fit in with our other ideas.\n\n340\n00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.840\nOnce we've analyzed our current situation,\nand\n\n341\n00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.150\nour current situation is\nwhere we are right now.\n\n342\n00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:58.420\nIt's a baseline if you will of\nwhat other ideas we've got, and\n\n343\n00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:02.860\nwhat our business as usual is that's\nwhen once we've analyzed that.\n\n344\n00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:07.110\nWe can start to look at how we implement,\nand\n\n345\n00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:10.540\nthat's the transition,\nthe implementation of that change.\n\n346\n00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.510\nI mean if that's something\nthat we really wanted to do\n\n347\n00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:17.680\nthen you know it's something\nthat's got to be planned.\n\n348\n00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.080\nWe can't just do that overnight.\n\n349\n00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.928\nWe really, really can't just do that\novernight even though we'd like to.\n\n350\n00:20:23.928 --> 00:20:29.040\nSo this particular framework.\n\n351\n00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.050\nAnd as I said this\nStanford Strategic Framework.\n\n352\n00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:36.180\nThis particular framework also has down\non the right side that would invest.\n\n353\n00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:41.250\nBecause we have to invest in our vision.\n\n354\n00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:44.580\nWe have to invest in that transition.\n\n355\n00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.200\nWithout the investment.\n\n356\n00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.350\nAnd invests starts with the ideation,\nthe nature, the vision,\n\n357\n00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:57.360\nthe engagement, the synthesis, which\nare all of these particular categories\n\n358\n00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:02.500\nthat are under transition, but\nwithout investment with all of these.\n\n359\n00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.760\nWithout this.\n\n360\n00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:09.070\nIf you miss out even one\nof the particular aspects,\n\n361\n00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:13.440\nif you consider anyone of these then,\nthat changes going to fail,\n\n362\n00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.923\nwe are talking about change\nat a transitional level,\n\n363\n00:21:16.923 --> 00:21:21.390\nat a transformational level and\nthat change is going to fail.\n\n364\n00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:26.260\nSo, I also want to bring you into,\nI'm just gonna break down so\n\n365\n00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.290\nthat the synthesis and\nthe transition here.\n\n366\n00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:33.760\nI'm gonna look at the types of change\nthat we have and the change timeline.\n\n367\n00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:39.450\nYou will see that portfolio, if we take\na look at that, and maybe if we can blow\n\n368\n00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:44.280\nit up on the full screen again because\nagain, the font's quite small on there.\n\n369\n00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.490\nYou will see that a portfolio level,\nthey're formulating the change.\n\n370\n00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:50.790\nAt program level,\n\n371\n00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:54.810\nthey're planning the change,\nat projects they're implementing change.\n\n372\n00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:59.280\nBut do you notice that that change is\nbeing implemented in an agile way?\n\n373\n00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:05.670\nYeah, we're implementing lots\nof little changes as it were.\n\n374\n00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:09.780\nSo, we're putting in the effort and\nthen we're also putting in additional\n\n375\n00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.920\neffort with any remedial action\nthat we might need to take.\n\n376\n00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.210\nAnd then operations.\n\n377\n00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.730\nTheir role is to sustain the change.\n\n378\n00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.900\nThe change that's being implemented.\n\n379\n00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.180\nPortfolio has the overarching view.\n\n380\n00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:29.278\nPortfolio is responsible for\nmultiple changes, whereas operations,\n\n381\n00:22:29.278 --> 00:22:35.126\nthey're responsible for sustaining the\nchange, and each individual program and\n\n382\n00:22:35.126 --> 00:22:39.573\nproject, they're responsible for\ndelivering the changes.\n\n383\n00:22:41.647 --> 00:22:46.116\nSo now, just before we round off for\nthis particular session, what I want to do\n\n384\n00:22:46.116 --> 00:22:50.600\nis just take a look at this, and\nthese are our critical success factors.\n\n385\n00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.030\nThis is what we have to achieve.\n\n386\n00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:55.960\nA critical success factor,\n\n387\n00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:01.110\nit's a factor that's critical to the\nsuccess of any transformational change.\n\n388\n00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.980\nThat's what a CSF means.\n\n389\n00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.360\nSo let's just take a look down these.\n\n390\n00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.720\nYou'll see that we need\nstakeholder collaboration.\n\n391\n00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.710\nWhat's a stakeholder, by the way?\n&gt;&gt; Someone that is invested into\n\n392\n00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:15.300\nthe success of their project.\n&gt;&gt; Ooh,\n\n393\n00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.810\nI like the word that you used there.\n\n394\n00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:21.140\nWhat do you mean by invest?\n&gt;&gt; It could be that\n\n395\n00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.830\nthey've provided either some\n&gt;&gt; Financial investment or\n\n396\n00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:27.770\nsome time investment, skill investment,\n\n397\n00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:30.610\nwhatever it might be.\n&gt;&gt; Well the reason why I asked that\n\n398\n00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:34.990\nquestion, and I was kind of leading Ronnie\ndown the wrong path at that point in time.\n\n399\n00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.610\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n400\n00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:37.190\n&gt;&gt; But it's alright because you know you\n\n401\n00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:38.370\nshould be used to by now.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n402\n00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:39.980\n&gt;&gt; Well, [LAUGH]\n\n403\n00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.755\n&gt;&gt; But the idea that deliberately because,\n\n404\n00:23:42.755 --> 00:23:47.033\nand this is where we start talking\nabout using the right words and\n\n405\n00:23:47.033 --> 00:23:51.947\ntalking in the right language and the\nsimple fact is that I know that here in\n\n406\n00:23:51.947 --> 00:23:56.487\nthe US, we have a slightly different\n&gt;&gt; Aspect or different perspective on\n\n407\n00:23:56.487 --> 00:24:00.328\nthe word stakeholder in that it\ntends to be sort of from primarily,\n\n408\n00:24:00.328 --> 00:24:02.350\na financial perspective.\n\n409\n00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:08.890\nWhereas back in England, a stakeholder\nis any interested party and it's\n\n410\n00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:13.290\nanybody that has an interest whether it\nis a vested interest in terms of finance.\n\n411\n00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:16.170\nBut it's also somebody who has\nan interest in the outcome.\n\n412\n00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:19.933\nSomebody who is going to be affected\nby any particular action or\n\n413\n00:24:19.933 --> 00:24:21.431\nany particular change.\n\n414\n00:24:21.431 --> 00:24:23.670\nSo a stakeholder is any interested party.\n\n415\n00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.372\nMy noisy neighbor is a stakeholder\nin my life, trust me.\n\n416\n00:24:26.372 --> 00:24:27.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n417\n00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.451\n&gt;&gt; So a stakeholder is anybody that's\n\n418\n00:24:30.451 --> 00:24:32.021\ngoing to be affected.\n\n419\n00:24:32.021 --> 00:24:35.375\nNow I also want to just\nmention that you don't get to\n\n420\n00:24:35.375 --> 00:24:40.830\ndecide who's a stakeholder and\nwho's not a stakeholder in that project.\n\n421\n00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:44.357\nAs far as any transformational project\nis concerned, right at the very\n\n422\n00:24:44.357 --> 00:24:48.082\nstart of the project, we should be\nidentifying who our stakeholders are.\n\n423\n00:24:48.082 --> 00:24:49.809\nBut if somebody comes to you and\n\n424\n00:24:49.809 --> 00:24:53.664\ntells you that they want to know\nthe result of any particular action or\n\n425\n00:24:53.664 --> 00:24:58.910\nthey want to know when you've completed a\ncertain task, then they are a stakeholder.\n\n426\n00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:01.654\nIf somebody comes to you and says, hey,\n\n427\n00:25:01.654 --> 00:25:05.949\nhow are you getting on with this,\nthen they are a stakeholder.\n\n428\n00:25:05.949 --> 00:25:11.309\nRemember in a previous episode,\nwe talked very briefly about resistance.\n\n429\n00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.487\nIf we dismiss somebody,\nif I come to you and I say to you, Ronnie,\n\n430\n00:25:16.487 --> 00:25:17.358\ndo you know what?\n\n431\n00:25:17.358 --> 00:25:20.649\nI want you to tell me when you've done\nthat or how are you getting on with this?\n\n432\n00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:26.410\nAnd you say, I'm fine and\nthen walk away and dismiss me.\n\n433\n00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:32.335\nI could turn into a source of resistance.\n\n434\n00:25:32.335 --> 00:25:35.765\nI could be that person, that sings.\n\n435\n00:25:35.765 --> 00:25:37.120\nWell, it's clearly not important.\n\n436\n00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.697\nWhatever Ronnie's working on,\nit's not really that important.\n\n437\n00:25:39.697 --> 00:25:43.140\nAnd so I'm going to go around and tell\neverybody that Ronnie's being rude to me.\n\n438\n00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.151\nRonnie doesn't want to talk to me.\n\n439\n00:25:45.151 --> 00:25:46.953\nI might sound like a five-year old if I\n\n440\n00:25:46.953 --> 00:25:47.541\ndo that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n441\n00:25:47.541 --> 00:25:48.859\n&gt;&gt; But nevertheless,\n\n442\n00:25:48.859 --> 00:25:52.200\nI could on and\nI could be that source of resistance.\n\n443\n00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:58.358\nAnd I have a saying, it only takes\none negative person to undermine\n\n444\n00:25:58.358 --> 00:26:02.570\nthe efforts of 500 positive people and\nthat is so true.\n\n445\n00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:06.725\nAnd all it would take is me just sow the\nlittle seeds of doubt in everybody's mind\n\n446\n00:26:06.725 --> 00:26:09.393\nand that would completely\nundermine your change,\n\n447\n00:26:09.393 --> 00:26:12.500\nwhatever it is you were trying to achieve.\n\n448\n00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:16.139\nSo a stakeholder is anybody that's\ninterested whether you agree with it or\n\n449\n00:26:16.139 --> 00:26:18.113\nnot, or whether you like that, or not.\n\n450\n00:26:18.113 --> 00:26:22.607\nBecause the fact of the matter is that if\nyou don't engage all of your stakeholders,\n\n451\n00:26:22.607 --> 00:26:25.203\nthen they could become\na source of resistance and\n\n452\n00:26:25.203 --> 00:26:27.315\nthat's something that we do not want.\n\n453\n00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:33.399\nSo we also want to,\nas our number two there for our CSF,\n\n454\n00:26:33.399 --> 00:26:35.591\nour critical success factor.\n\n455\n00:26:35.591 --> 00:26:38.720\nWe wanna allocate time for our acceptance.\n\n456\n00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:43.739\nWe want to make sure that we\nhave enough time not just\n\n457\n00:26:43.739 --> 00:26:48.777\nto implement the change,\nbut to embed the change.\n\n458\n00:26:48.777 --> 00:26:51.180\nIdeally, people should be so\nhungry for a change.\n\n459\n00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:55.052\nRemember we talked about Kotter's\neight steps in a previous episode and\n\n460\n00:26:55.052 --> 00:26:58.450\nabout creating a sense of urgency,\nand creating a need.\n\n461\n00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:02.518\nAnd the fact that I was desperate for\nan Apple Watch when it came out and\n\n462\n00:27:02.518 --> 00:27:07.029\nthen realized I couldn't see it, [LAUGH]\nbut the fact of that matter is that.\n\n463\n00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:11.260\nApple took the time to\nappeal to me directly.\n\n464\n00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:14.884\nWell, I would like to think so.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n465\n00:27:14.884 --> 00:27:17.253\n&gt;&gt; I'm just flattering myself here, but\n\n466\n00:27:17.253 --> 00:27:21.200\nthey took the time appeal to me\ndirectly which meant that when they\n\n467\n00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.650\nimplemented the watch or\nrather when they deployed it.\n\n468\n00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:29.926\nWhen they released it, then they\ndidn't need to embed that change.\n\n469\n00:27:29.926 --> 00:27:32.389\nThey didn't need to convince me to go and\nbuy one.\n\n470\n00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:33.500\nI went and bought it.\n\n471\n00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.880\nI was one of those early adopters and\n\n472\n00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:41.367\nthen I go to the part when I realized that\nI had that peak of inflated expectations.\n\n473\n00:27:41.367 --> 00:27:43.080\nAnd yeah, I couldn't use it.\n\n474\n00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:49.415\nSo we have to allocate time for that,\nbecause we know that there may be people\n\n475\n00:27:49.415 --> 00:27:53.692\nwith any change that are like methat\nare early adopters that go and\n\n476\n00:27:53.692 --> 00:27:54.954\nbuy the new watch.\n\n477\n00:27:54.954 --> 00:27:59.849\nBut now, I'm gonna have to spend some\ntime actually learning how to use\n\n478\n00:27:59.849 --> 00:28:04.591\nthe watch in a way that I can use it,\nso that I will accept that change.\n\n479\n00:28:04.591 --> 00:28:06.530\nSo that I will actually start using it.\n\n480\n00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:11.400\nBecause if I don't,\nthen the watch is gonna be unsuccessful.\n\n481\n00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.199\nBecause what's gonna happen is everybody\nthat I talk to, I'm gonna say, well,\n\n482\n00:28:15.199 --> 00:28:15.926\nyou know what?\n\n483\n00:28:15.926 --> 00:28:17.920\nIt looks great, but\nit doesn't do anything.\n\n484\n00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:25.520\nSo you have to take the time to embed\nthe change and then we've got to ensure\n\n485\n00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:30.190\nthat all of our technology is aligned with\nany initiative that we want to undertake.\n\n486\n00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.430\nYou know IT projects tend\nto go one of two ways.\n\n487\n00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:41.020\nWe tend to focus completely on\nthe technology, that's what happens\n\n488\n00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:45.350\nwith a lot of IT projects or we focus\ncompletely on the processes and changing\n\n489\n00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:50.220\nof the ways of the working and changing of\nphilosophy and changing our strategies.\n\n490\n00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.812\nAnd I've seen a lot of projects that fail,\n\n491\n00:28:52.812 --> 00:28:55.549\nbecause we forget to\nmerge the two together.\n\n492\n00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:58.340\nWe forget about the synergy\nbetween the two.\n\n493\n00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.690\nUltimately, your tools that you use,\n\n494\n00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:04.740\ntechnology is there to facilitate\nwhatever outcome you need.\n\n495\n00:29:06.675 --> 00:29:11.490\nA tool is not going to do the job for\nyou, unless you tell it what job to do.\n\n496\n00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:19.200\nYou cannot implement a financial\nmanagement system, if you don't tell that\n\n497\n00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:24.400\nfinancial management system how to operate\nand how to work with your processes.\n\n498\n00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.655\nSo you can't focus just\npurely on the talk.\n\n499\n00:29:27.655 --> 00:29:32.057\nBut in the same way, you can't then\nimplement a new financial management way\n\n500\n00:29:32.057 --> 00:29:36.340\nof working if you haven't got the right\ntools to support you in doing that.\n\n501\n00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:40.394\nBecause otherwise, you're gonna spend\na lot of time cutting and pasting and\n\n502\n00:29:40.394 --> 00:29:44.587\nwriting things down and that's not gonna\nbe very efficient and let's face it.\n\n503\n00:29:44.587 --> 00:29:48.180\nIt's not what we want to achieve\nwhen we're implementing any change.\n\n504\n00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:52.440\nSo don't focus purely on the technology.\n\n505\n00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.912\nDon't focus purely on the processes,\nbut ensure that they are aligned.\n\n506\n00:29:56.912 --> 00:30:01.481\nBut what we do want to do is number four\nis we want to focus on the improvement\n\n507\n00:30:01.481 --> 00:30:06.126\nthat's being made and that has to be\nsomething that we have to ensure that we\n\n508\n00:30:06.126 --> 00:30:09.900\nare vocal about, and\nthat we can market that change.\n\n509\n00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:14.563\nWe use that to create that sense\nof urgency and I love number five.\n\n510\n00:30:14.563 --> 00:30:18.707\nThe thing about developing talent\nbased on change management competency.\n\n511\n00:30:18.707 --> 00:30:21.210\nDo you know what that\nreally means in a nutshell?\n\n512\n00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:23.750\nIdentifying and developing talent?\n\n513\n00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:26.272\nUse the right people to\nimplement the change.\n\n514\n00:30:26.272 --> 00:30:26.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n515\n00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, it makes sense.\n\n516\n00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:34.584\nAnd if you don't have anybody with\nthe necessary skills, then train them.\n\n517\n00:30:34.584 --> 00:30:36.140\nDevelop the talent.\n\n518\n00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.580\nI'm not just talking about\ntechnical skills, either.\n\n519\n00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:43.731\nI'm talking about people with the right\nskills to implement the change and\n\n520\n00:30:43.731 --> 00:30:49.208\nto be able to engage with the stakeholders\nand then formalize that philosophy,\n\n521\n00:30:49.208 --> 00:30:54.457\nthat policy you change management is\nreally about having a change process.\n\n522\n00:30:54.457 --> 00:30:58.755\nRight at the beginning of this episode,\nI said to you that change management\n\n523\n00:30:58.755 --> 00:31:02.020\nis the process that is\nthe most frequently bypassed.\n\n524\n00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.180\nBecause it seem to be too bureaucratic.\n\n525\n00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:08.990\nThis is why we need to have a philosophy,\na policy of change management.\n\n526\n00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:10.925\nBut nobody thinks about bypassing it,\n\n527\n00:31:10.925 --> 00:31:13.333\nbecause change management\nworks efficiently.\n\n528\n00:31:13.333 --> 00:31:19.907\nAnd therefore, we utilize it, then we have\na standard way of implementing changes.\n\n529\n00:31:19.907 --> 00:31:25.273\nIf I'm working with you and you work\na completely different way to say,\n\n530\n00:31:25.273 --> 00:31:29.387\nWes who works a completely\ndifferent way to Cherokee,\n\n531\n00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:33.070\nwho works a completely\ndifferent way to Justin.\n\n532\n00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:36.054\nThen it makes it very,\nvery difficult for me,\n\n533\n00:31:36.054 --> 00:31:41.730\nbecause I have to adapt my way of working\nevery time I work with somebody new.\n\n534\n00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:46.669\nAnd so do you which is why if we don't\nhave a policy for change management,\n\n535\n00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:51.450\nand we don't have a standard way to\napproach change, then every time we\n\n536\n00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:55.936\nhave to complete a new change,\nwe've got to do in a different way.\n\n537\n00:31:55.936 --> 00:31:59.206\nWe're reinventing the wheel every time and\nit doesn't make any sense,\n\n538\n00:31:59.206 --> 00:32:01.200\nand it's certainly not efficient to do so.\n\n539\n00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:03.680\nThis is why in number ten,\n\n540\n00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.700\nwe've gotta deploy then the change\nmanagement processes and\n\n541\n00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:11.840\ntools that are actually going to help us\nto fulfill that change management policy.\n\n542\n00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:15.703\nWithout any one of these seven CSFs,\n\n543\n00:32:15.703 --> 00:32:20.289\nthen change management at any level\nwhether it is at project level or\n\n544\n00:32:20.289 --> 00:32:25.278\nwhether it is at portfolio level,\nwhether it is organizational-wide or\n\n545\n00:32:25.278 --> 00:32:28.511\nwhether it's even just\nat operational level.\n\n546\n00:32:28.511 --> 00:32:32.180\nWithout any one of these, then change\nmanagement is not going to be successful.\n\n547\n00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.192\nIt's gonna be cumbersome.\n\n548\n00:32:33.192 --> 00:32:35.360\nIt's gonna be perceived as bureaucratic.\n\n549\n00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.993\nAnd more importantly,\nit's going to take time.\n\n550\n00:32:38.993 --> 00:32:44.820\nSo here we are, focusing then\non the critical success factors.\n\n551\n00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:50.122\nThis is what we've got to achieve\nwithin change management.\n\n552\n00:32:50.122 --> 00:32:55.510\nSo for our particular episode right now,\nI'm gonna wrap things up.\n\n553\n00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:59.976\nBut when we come back, we're going\nto take a further dive into sort of\n\n554\n00:32:59.976 --> 00:33:05.222\nthe potential barriers and what could\nprohibit successful change management.\n\n555\n00:33:05.222 --> 00:33:05.855\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo.\n\n556\n00:33:05.855 --> 00:33:06.823\nWell, thank you again for\n\n557\n00:33:06.823 --> 00:33:10.170\nhelping us to understand a little bit\nmore about the idea of strategic change.\n\n558\n00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:14.105\nJo also presented us\nwith the idea of a model,\n\n559\n00:33:14.105 --> 00:33:16.894\nthe Stanford, what was it?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n560\n00:33:16.894 --> 00:33:18.840\n&gt;&gt; Strategic execution\n\n561\n00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.451\nframework.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yep.\n\n562\n00:33:20.451 --> 00:33:21.568\n&gt;&gt; We took a look at that.\n\n563\n00:33:21.568 --> 00:33:26.417\nAnd we also, of course, talked a little\nbit about the idea of the different cycles\n\n564\n00:33:26.417 --> 00:33:28.245\nof change that are out there and\n\n565\n00:33:28.245 --> 00:33:32.251\nalso critical success factors that\nwe see when we start taking a look\n\n566\n00:33:32.251 --> 00:33:36.110\nat the idea of implementing\nsome type of strategic change.\n\n567\n00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:39.025\nBut there is more to come as Jo was\nsaying, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n568\n00:33:39.025 --> 00:33:39.947\nsign off right here.\n\n569\n00:33:39.947 --> 00:33:43.947\nFor ITPro.TV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n570\n00:33:43.947 --> 00:33:45.130\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\n\n571\n00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:47.898\nmore of the Organisational\nChange Management episodes.\n\n572\n00:33:47.898 --> 00:33:55.083\n[MUSIC]\n\n573\n00:33:55.083 --> 00:33:58.160\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV\n\n",

00:00:08.214\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:13.197\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another\n\n5\n00:00:13.197 --> 00:00:15.417\ngreat episode right here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:19.120\nYou're watching\nthe Organizational Change Management show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.570\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n8\n00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.330\ntoday we're going to be taking\na look at barriers to change.\n\n9\n00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330\nAnd who better to help us to understand\nwhat barriers we may have to overcome as\n\n10\n00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.720\nwe implement change, than the change\nmaestra herself, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.520\nJo, welcome to the show,\nhow are you doing?\n\n12\n00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.130\n&gt;&gt; I am fine,\n\n13\n00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.080\nthank you Ronnie, how are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing well, Jo,\n\n14\n00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.620\nbut we are now talking about\nthe idea of barriers to change.\n\n15\n00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.630\nNow, who could actually be\na true barrier to change?\n\n16\n00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.468\nIf change is inevitable, how can that be?\n&gt;&gt; This speaks the person who still has,\n\n17\n00:00:50.468 --> 00:00:53.972\nand I'm gonna keep going on\nabout this old TV that I've\n\n18\n00:00:53.972 --> 00:00:56.183\nfound out that Ronnie has.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:56.183 --> 00:00:58.451\n&gt;&gt; This old cathode-ray tube that sits in\n\n20\n00:00:58.451 --> 00:01:02.072\nthe corner of the living room.\n&gt;&gt; It's a Zenith, it's a Zenith.\n\n21\n00:01:02.072 --> 00:01:04.334\nEverybody that appreciates\nquality appreciates Zenith.\n\n22\n00:01:04.334 --> 00:01:06.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's in a wooden box and\n\n23\n00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.010\nit doesn't have a remote control does it?\n&gt;&gt; No it has dials.\n\n24\n00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.880\n&gt;&gt; And then you ask me what a barrier to\n\n25\n00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.959\nchange is.\n&gt;&gt; Right, you say change is inevitable.\n\n26\n00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:15.984\n&gt;&gt; I could bring a mirror in for\n\n27\n00:01:15.984 --> 00:01:16.928\nthe next show.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n28\n00:01:16.928 --> 00:01:18.407\n&gt;&gt; That's all I'm gonna do is I'm just\n\n29\n00:01:18.407 --> 00:01:21.312\ngonna bring a mirror.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Jo, here we go.\n\n30\n00:01:21.312 --> 00:01:25.021\n[LAUGH] There's no doubt that there\nare people that are barriers.\n\n31\n00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:26.397\nBut I-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Really?\n\n32\n00:01:26.397 --> 00:01:27.191\n&gt;&gt; I don't [LAUGH],\n\n33\n00:01:27.191 --> 00:01:31.117\nI don't know if that's where we were going\nwith it, but sure let's go with that.\n\n34\n00:01:31.117 --> 00:01:31.881\n&gt;&gt; Well actually,\n\n35\n00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:34.503\nfunny enough, we are kind of going there.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good [LAUGH].\n\n36\n00:01:34.503 --> 00:01:36.221\n&gt;&gt; Because what we're gonna do in this\n\n37\n00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:39.957\nparticular episode is we're going to\nlook at potential barriers to change.\n\n38\n00:01:39.957 --> 00:01:43.240\nAnd we're gonna look at how we can\novercome those potential barriers.\n\n39\n00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.950\nAnd we have to accept the fact that\nsometimes it's just a lost cause.\n\n40\n00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.528\nThat's all I can say to that one.\n&gt;&gt; I can see Jo just flashing up a picture\n\n41\n00:01:50.528 --> 00:01:52.955\nof me as she talks about\nbarriers to change.\n\n42\n00:01:52.955 --> 00:01:54.669\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Barriers to change, that's it, Ronnie,\n\n43\n00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:56.384\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's possible.\n\n44\n00:01:56.384 --> 00:01:58.114\n&gt;&gt; What I wanna do, first of all,\n\n45\n00:01:58.114 --> 00:02:02.442\nis I just wanna take a look at, because\nwe're gonna talk about one particular\n\n46\n00:02:02.442 --> 00:02:03.152\nslide.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n47\n00:02:03.152 --> 00:02:07.647\nthat one particular slide is the one\nthat's in front of you right now.\n\n48\n00:02:07.647 --> 00:02:12.895\nHey look at that, see that's because\nwe have an amazing director here.\n\n49\n00:02:12.895 --> 00:02:17.533\nWe're gonna just discuss each\none of these really in turn,\n\n50\n00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:21.448\nbecause these are potential\nbarriers to change.\n\n51\n00:02:21.448 --> 00:02:27.774\nThis is not a definite,\nthere's no certain barriers to change.\n\n52\n00:02:27.774 --> 00:02:34.251\nHowever you're gonna have to identify\nwhat your change resistors are.\n\n53\n00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:38.765\nBecause there are gonna be some\nresistance or some resistors to change,\n\n54\n00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:40.911\nno matter which way you look at it.\n\n55\n00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:44.137\nChange, especially\na transformational level, change is,\n\n56\n00:02:44.137 --> 00:02:48.053\nwell it's going to unsettle some people,\nit's going to unnerve people.\n\n57\n00:02:48.053 --> 00:02:52.940\nAnd so we have to ensure that we\nidentify any resistance as early as we\n\n58\n00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.196\npossibly can, and that we,\nI was going to say\n\n59\n00:02:56.196 --> 00:02:58.866\neliminate any resistance [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n60\n00:02:58.866 --> 00:02:59.502\n&gt;&gt; But that kind of sounds\n\n61\n00:02:59.502 --> 00:03:00.174\na little bit too harsh.\n\n62\n00:03:00.174 --> 00:03:02.634\nMaybe I should use the word annihilate,\nperhaps.\n\n63\n00:03:02.634 --> 00:03:05.110\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wow.\n\n64\n00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.020\n&gt;&gt; No, let's not go there, what we wanna\n\n65\n00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.270\ndo is we wanna overcome resistance.\n&gt;&gt; Destroy?\n\n66\n00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.130\n&gt;&gt; Destroy, yeah, yeah.\n\n67\n00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.521\nWe're not talking about flamethrowers or\nanything like that.\n\n68\n00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:18.810\nWe just simply wanna overcome resistance.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sounds good.\n\n69\n00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.270\n&gt;&gt; What I wanna do Ronnie is I don't\n\n70\n00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.460\njust wanna convince you that\na new TV is a good idea.\n\n71\n00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.445\nI actually want to get you to\na point where you need a new TV,\n\n72\n00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:30.719\n[LAUGH] where you're desperate for\na new TV.\n\n73\n00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:34.021\n[CROSSTALK] I'd say I'd be banging\nmy head against a brick wall.\n\n74\n00:03:34.021 --> 00:03:35.176\n&gt;&gt; Are you bringing a hammer to my house,\n\n75\n00:03:35.176 --> 00:03:36.050\ns that what you're saying?\n\n76\n00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.218\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I might have to, I might have to.\n\n77\n00:03:40.218 --> 00:03:43.715\nSo, let's take a look at this in\nan organizational perspective then,\n\n78\n00:03:43.715 --> 00:03:45.482\nlet's take a look at some of these.\n\n79\n00:03:45.482 --> 00:03:48.107\nA lack of consistent sponsorship,\n\n80\n00:03:48.107 --> 00:03:53.000\nI'm gonna change the word\nsponsorship to leadership, okay?\n\n81\n00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.990\nBecause what I actually mean here,\nis the person, the leader, the sponsor,\n\n82\n00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.000\nthe CIO, the CEO.\n\n83\n00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.920\nThat stands there right at the beginning\nof any particular initiative and\n\n84\n00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.790\nsays, hey look get on board,\nthis is an absolutely fantastic idea.\n\n85\n00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.360\nAnd then you don't hear\nanything else from them.\n\n86\n00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.560\nThat's lack of consistent leadership.\n\n87\n00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.240\nSo if my manager,\nif the person that is leading the charge,\n\n88\n00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.050\nbasically says to me hey look,\nthis is a great idea.\n\n89\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.285\nAnd then I don't hear anything\nfrom them for six months.\n\n90\n00:04:28.285 --> 00:04:31.600\nWhat's gonna happen, do you think?\n\n91\n00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.710\nBearing in mind, you knowing me,\n\n92\n00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.548\nwhat do you think's gonna happen?\n&gt;&gt; I would assume that the person will get\n\n93\n00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:40.619\nvery discouraged in what\nwe're actually doing.\n\n94\n00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:41.487\n&gt;&gt; The person?\n\n95\n00:04:41.487 --> 00:04:42.234\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n96\n00:04:42.234 --> 00:04:43.932\n&gt;&gt; I was talking about me.\n\n97\n00:04:43.932 --> 00:04:46.953\nI don't know what would happen,\nwhat would you do?\n\n98\n00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.145\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I wouldn't just get\n\n99\n00:04:48.145 --> 00:04:50.655\ndiscouraged, I'd probably just walk away.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n100\n00:04:50.655 --> 00:04:52.650\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's exactly what I would do,\n\n101\n00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.247\nI would probably just walk away.\n\n102\n00:04:54.247 --> 00:04:56.248\n[LAUGH] I would say, you know what,\n\n103\n00:04:56.248 --> 00:05:01.009\nif you're not really sort of interested in\nme being on board then I'm probably not\n\n104\n00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.175\ninterested in taking part in that change.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n105\n00:05:05.175 --> 00:05:07.754\n&gt;&gt; I'm not unusual unlike some.\n\n106\n00:05:07.754 --> 00:05:09.854\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Jo.\n\n107\n00:05:09.854 --> 00:05:13.135\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm not unusual in this, right?\n\n108\n00:05:13.135 --> 00:05:18.368\nBut I am the sort of person\nthat I want to be motivated\n\n109\n00:05:18.368 --> 00:05:22.550\nby the passion of my manager, my CEO.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n110\n00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.610\n&gt;&gt; And if my CEO is passionate about what\n\n111\n00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.440\nit is that we're trying to achieve, then\nI'm going to be passionate about that.\n\n112\n00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.930\nIf my CEO exudes passion for the first\nfive minutes, or for the first week.\n\n113\n00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.790\nAnd then their passion\nkinda dwindles off and\n\n114\n00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.710\nthey don't show any involvement\nin any change, then so is mine.\n\n115\n00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.770\nThe chances of the success of that change\n\n116\n00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.950\nthen starts to dwindle.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n117\n00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.550\n&gt;&gt; So we need to have consistent\n\n118\n00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.170\nleadership.\n\n119\n00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.570\nWe need to have consistent sponsorship.\n\n120\n00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.090\nWe need to have, well,\na communication plan, regular,\n\n121\n00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.570\nfrequent communication from leadership\nthat this is still the right direction.\n\n122\n00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.970\nThis is still a direction\nthat we're heading in.\n\n123\n00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.840\nNow, I'm gonna sorta add\na caveat into that as well,\n\n124\n00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.810\nbecause I said regular,\nconsistent communication.\n\n125\n00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.544\nI don't mean an email every single day,\ncuz trust me I'm not gonna read that and\n\n126\n00:06:16.544 --> 00:06:17.470\nneither are you.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n127\n00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.030\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n128\n00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.230\nnone of us are going to do that.\n\n129\n00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.420\nSo when we talk about regular just think,\n\n130\n00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.385\nI mean once every ten years is regular\nthat's clearly not regular enough.\n\n131\n00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:29.668\nBut so is once a day, and\nonce a day is probably too regular.\n\n132\n00:06:29.668 --> 00:06:32.813\nSo you know your people,\nif you are leading change,\n\n133\n00:06:32.813 --> 00:06:34.608\nyou know who your people are.\n\n134\n00:06:34.608 --> 00:06:38.603\nYou know who it is that you depend on for\nthe success of that change.\n\n135\n00:06:38.603 --> 00:06:41.415\nSo you wanna ensure\nthat they stay engaged,\n\n136\n00:06:41.415 --> 00:06:47.025\nwhich means that the leadership have\na responsibility to stay engaged.\n\n137\n00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:49.810\nSo the next one then.\n\n138\n00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.465\nIf we just bring that slide back up,\n\n139\n00:06:51.465 --> 00:06:55.080\nyou'll see that the next slide\nthere is cultural resistance.\n\n140\n00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.960\nWhat can I say about cultural resistance?\n\n141\n00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.940\nWell in the previous episode,\nwe looked at culture.\n\n142\n00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.876\nAnd we've looked at it sort of\nright the way through our episodes.\n\n143\n00:07:02.876 --> 00:07:05.805\nAnd we've looked at whether the,\n\n144\n00:07:05.805 --> 00:07:10.653\nwell whether the culture is\nacceptable to change or not,\n\n145\n00:07:10.653 --> 00:07:15.402\nor adaptable to change, or\nis well able to take change.\n\n146\n00:07:15.402 --> 00:07:21.070\nThe cultural of an organization is really\ncritical in transformational change.\n\n147\n00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.600\nIf the entire cultural\nis resistant to change,\n\n148\n00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.970\nthen the organization is not\ngoing to be able to move forward.\n\n149\n00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.670\nAnd I will say over and over again, that\nall it takes is just one negative person.\n\n150\n00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.590\nAnd they can undermine\nthe positivity of 500 people.\n\n151\n00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.551\nThey can undermine\nthe success of the change.\n\n152\n00:07:42.551 --> 00:07:46.070\nSo what we want to nurture is\na culture within your organization.\n\n153\n00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.369\nIf you want change to be successful,\nyou have to nurture\n\n154\n00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:55.042\na culture where any negativity\nis viewed as an opportunity.\n\n155\n00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:59.816\nSo where any negativity is\nviewed as An opportunity for\n\n156\n00:07:59.816 --> 00:08:03.344\nsomebody to sit down with that person and\n\n157\n00:08:03.344 --> 00:08:09.540\nto incorporate that negativity,\nto overcome the negativity.\n\n158\n00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.582\nCultural resistance, when we think about,\nand we looked at it in previous episodes.\n\n159\n00:08:13.582 --> 00:08:16.228\nWe think about people that\nare early adopters and\n\n160\n00:08:16.228 --> 00:08:19.220\nthen we think about people\nthat are our late adopters.\n\n161\n00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.364\nAnd I think, what was it we called you?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n162\n00:08:22.364 --> 00:08:24.268\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n163\n00:08:24.268 --> 00:08:25.972\n&gt;&gt; Many, many names, Jo, but\n\n164\n00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:28.140\nwe won't go there.\n\n165\n00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.355\nThey were the laggards, I believe or\nsomething like that, laggards,\n\n166\n00:08:31.355 --> 00:08:33.728\nI think that was the term, laggard.\n&gt;&gt; But note,\n\n167\n00:08:33.728 --> 00:08:36.462\nI didn't call Ronnie a laggard, right?\n\n168\n00:08:36.462 --> 00:08:39.490\nHe called himself a laggard.\n&gt;&gt; I think that was what was on the slide.\n\n169\n00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.039\n&gt;&gt; It was, yeah.\n\n170\n00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:41.170\n&gt;&gt; It was laggard, yeah,\n\n171\n00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.555\nI believe.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was, but you see,\n\n172\n00:08:43.555 --> 00:08:45.669\nwe want to bring these people on board.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n173\n00:08:45.669 --> 00:08:46.283\n&gt;&gt; Because,\n\n174\n00:08:46.283 --> 00:08:49.556\nif we can't convince them that\nsomething is a good idea,\n\n175\n00:08:49.556 --> 00:08:52.570\nthen quite simply they're\nnot going to be on board.\n\n176\n00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.443\nAnd they could potentially be resisters.\n\n177\n00:08:55.443 --> 00:09:00.272\nAnd so, we want to ensure that\nthe negativity of one person doesn't\n\n178\n00:09:00.272 --> 00:09:04.970\nundermine the entire success\nof that whole project.\n\n179\n00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.519\nWhen we talk about cultural resistance,\n\n180\n00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:09.497\nwe're not just talking about individual\npeople and their opinions, though.\n\n181\n00:09:09.497 --> 00:09:14.204\nWe're also talking about\nthe entire organization as well,\n\n182\n00:09:14.204 --> 00:09:18.460\nand the organization may\nmake it difficult to change.\n\n183\n00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.083\nIf we're set in our ways as\nan organization, and I mean,\n\n184\n00:09:23.083 --> 00:09:25.579\nthere are some organizations\nthat I've walked into.\n\n185\n00:09:25.579 --> 00:09:28.306\nAnd I'll be perfectly honest with you,\nif I hear the words, but\n\n186\n00:09:28.306 --> 00:09:29.870\nthat's the way we've always done it.\n\n187\n00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.870\nIf I hear those words one more time,\nI would walk out there screaming.\n\n188\n00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:38.280\nBut the simple fact is that there are some\norganizations where that is actually a way\n\n189\n00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.230\nof life for them.\n\n190\n00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.683\nBut we've always done it like this,\nwe don't want to change this,\n\n191\n00:09:42.683 --> 00:09:46.330\nwe might upset people,\nwe've got to give them the VIP treatment.\n\n192\n00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.668\nAnd therefore,\nthey've got to be different,\n\n193\n00:09:49.668 --> 00:09:53.624\nthat's all part of cultural resistance.\n\n194\n00:09:53.624 --> 00:09:54.842\nWe can't change what we do for\n\n195\n00:09:54.842 --> 00:09:57.150\nthem because we've got to\ngive them the VIP treatment.\n\n196\n00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:02.041\nSo therefore everything has got to stay\nexactly the same, that, in itself,\n\n197\n00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:04.160\nis part of cultural resistance.\n\n198\n00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.453\nSo that is a big barrier to change and\nquite often an organization that\n\n199\n00:10:08.453 --> 00:10:13.800\nsuffers from cultural resistance will\nactually put barriers in the way.\n\n200\n00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.110\nAnd I've come across\norganizations like that.\n\n201\n00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:19.290\nThese people are very important,\nthese are our VIPs and\n\n202\n00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:23.716\ntherefore we've got to keep\nthings the way that they like it.\n\n203\n00:10:23.716 --> 00:10:27.941\nAnd that means that we've got to keep\naround this old piece of technology\n\n204\n00:10:27.941 --> 00:10:30.170\nbecause that's what they like to do.\n\n205\n00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:34.120\nThey like to use this,\nthey like the look and feel of this.\n\n206\n00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.380\nThat's a cultural resistance and\nthat's something that we've to get over.\n\n207\n00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.957\nAnd sure, people might like,\nsome of your users who might consider\n\n208\n00:10:41.957 --> 00:10:45.830\nthemselves to be VIPs,\nyou may consider them to be VIPs.\n\n209\n00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.823\nAnd sure they might like to use\nthe same thing that they've used for\n\n210\n00:10:49.823 --> 00:10:52.900\nthe last 20 years, but\nthey're also realists.\n\n211\n00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.722\nAnd they understand that\nthe modern world has moved on, and\n\n212\n00:10:55.722 --> 00:10:58.840\nthey understand that technology\nhasn't stayed the same.\n\n213\n00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.810\nAnd they're probably wondering themselves,\nthese are your VIPs, your users.\n\n214\n00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:06.685\nThey're probably wondering themselves why\non earth IT hasn't changed along with\n\n215\n00:11:06.685 --> 00:11:09.410\ntechnology that's out\nin the big wide world.\n\n216\n00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.336\nIt happens, it happens more often\nthan you want to think about,\n\n217\n00:11:14.336 --> 00:11:15.900\nmore often than you realize.\n\n218\n00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.142\nWhere I've walked into an organization,\nand they've said, but\n\n219\n00:11:19.142 --> 00:11:20.612\nthe users want to do it this way.\n\n220\n00:11:20.612 --> 00:11:23.503\nAnd then when you go in and\ntalk to the users, they're sitting there,\n\n221\n00:11:23.503 --> 00:11:26.190\nscratching their heads, thinking,\nbut I don't understand.\n\n222\n00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.727\nBecause I've been using\nthis new cell phone and\n\n223\n00:11:28.727 --> 00:11:30.830\nI get a new cell phone every six months.\n\n224\n00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:35.220\nAnd IT hasn't changed for the last ten\nyears, and I don't understand why.\n\n225\n00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.686\nBecause we make excuses for\nthe fact that we don't want to change,\n\n226\n00:11:40.686 --> 00:11:42.720\nand that's a really good excuse.\n\n227\n00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.399\nSo let's take a look at another\nsource of resistance, then,\n\n228\n00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:50.800\na potential source of resistance,\ninsufficient time allocated.\n\n229\n00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.009\nYeah, I mean, that one is so\ntypical, isn't it?\n\n230\n00:11:53.009 --> 00:11:56.930\nThat's the wrong way,\nI want it and I want it now.\n\n231\n00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:01.009\nThat sounds like me, I'll be honest,\nyeah, I want this change and\n\n232\n00:12:01.009 --> 00:12:02.450\nI want it to happen now.\n\n233\n00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.508\nIf we allocate insufficient time,\n\n234\n00:12:06.508 --> 00:12:11.200\nthen what you're going to get is you're\neither going to get poor quality.\n\n235\n00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.476\nOr it's going to cost more,\npotentially, or\n\n236\n00:12:14.476 --> 00:12:17.420\nquite simply the change is going to fail.\n\n237\n00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.594\nSo we shouldn't do that, I mean,\nthat goes without saying,\n\n238\n00:12:23.594 --> 00:12:27.290\nreally, allocate sufficient\ntime to the change.\n\n239\n00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:33.245\nThere's a balance, though,\nbecause that balance is really simple,\n\n240\n00:12:33.245 --> 00:12:36.860\nif we don't allocate enough time.\n\n241\n00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.460\nAnd as I've said, we're going to either\nend up with something that's poor quality,\n\n242\n00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.400\nthat people aren't going\nto be impressed by.\n\n243\n00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.840\nAnd therefore they're going to be\nmore resistant to future change.\n\n244\n00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.257\nOr we're going to end up with\nsomething that's overpriced,\n\n245\n00:12:49.257 --> 00:12:51.040\nit's going to cost us too much.\n\n246\n00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.406\nAnd again, that then sets the tone for\nthe next change and\n\n247\n00:12:53.406 --> 00:12:55.440\npeople are going to be\nresistant to more change.\n\n248\n00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.170\nBecause they're going to say, well,\nthat's going to cost us more money.\n\n249\n00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:05.037\nOr we get to a point where we're rushing\nthings and we've just got chaos,\n\n250\n00:13:05.037 --> 00:13:07.780\nbut then you've also got the flip side.\n\n251\n00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:12.172\nAnd the flip side is that if\nwe allocate too much time for\n\n252\n00:13:12.172 --> 00:13:15.240\nchange, then people lose interest.\n\n253\n00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.683\nYou promised me this six months ago and\nI haven't seen anything and I've moved on,\n\n254\n00:13:19.683 --> 00:13:21.410\nmy requirements have moved on.\n\n255\n00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.610\nI've changed,\nI don't want the same thing anymore.\n\n256\n00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:29.083\nSo we have to get the timing right\nwhen it comes to change, and\n\n257\n00:13:29.083 --> 00:13:31.990\nthis is why we talk about agile change.\n\n258\n00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.860\nWe talk about little enough, and\nwe talk about continual improvement.\n\n259\n00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:41.090\nWith each change making an iterative\nimprovement on the last.\n\n260\n00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:45.316\nBecause if we wait for\n18 months to implement a brand new change,\n\n261\n00:13:45.316 --> 00:13:49.100\nand we wait for\n18 months to implement it in its entirety.\n\n262\n00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:53.472\nChances are the person that\nyou marketed it to 18 months\n\n263\n00:13:53.472 --> 00:13:55.940\nago had forgotten all about it.\n\n264\n00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.962\nEither that or they were tired\nof waiting and then went off and\n\n265\n00:13:58.962 --> 00:14:00.810\nsourced their own solution anyway.\n\n266\n00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.500\nSo get the timing right with change.\n\n267\n00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.330\nAnd then let's look at\nthe other ones there.\n\n268\n00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:10.360\nSo we've got here poor\naccess to technology.\n\n269\n00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:15.506\nI said in a previous episode that\nin terms of technology, technology\n\n270\n00:14:15.506 --> 00:14:21.380\nis here to facilitate your end goal,\nit's there to facilitate your outcome.\n\n271\n00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:28.480\nSo technology should be there to\nsupport whatever the change is.\n\n272\n00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.130\nSo if you are bringing in then a new tool,\nthen that's an easy change to see.\n\n273\n00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.531\nIf you're bringing in a new tool\nto manage your financial systems,\n\n274\n00:14:36.531 --> 00:14:38.030\nthen that's an easy change.\n\n275\n00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:42.406\nAnd your change is focused on your\ntechnology, and that's great,\n\n276\n00:14:42.406 --> 00:14:46.960\nbecause you're thinking about\nthe technology at that point in time.\n\n277\n00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.592\nBut what happens if you're bringing in\na change to the way of working, and\n\n278\n00:14:50.592 --> 00:14:52.710\nyou've forgotten about the technology?\n\n279\n00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.150\nAnd that happens, too.\n\n280\n00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.670\nYou're so focused on the process.\n\n281\n00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:59.137\nYou're so focused on what a new\nprocess is supposed to deliver,\n\n282\n00:14:59.137 --> 00:15:01.960\nor a new way of working\nis supposed to deliver.\n\n283\n00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:06.427\nBut you forget to ensure that\nthe technology is going to be able to\n\n284\n00:15:06.427 --> 00:15:09.750\nsupport that,\nthat quite often happens to me.\n\n285\n00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:14.040\nI mean, I have to say that I have had to\nchange the way I do things quite a lot.\n\n286\n00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:18.611\nI mean, I am obviously not from\nthe same place that you are, and\n\n287\n00:15:18.611 --> 00:15:21.380\nI have had to move from the UK to the US.\n\n288\n00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:25.538\nAnd the way that we do things around here\nis a lot different to the way we do things\n\n289\n00:15:25.538 --> 00:15:26.990\nback home, back in the UK.\n\n290\n00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:32.180\nAnd that means that a lot of, I've had\nto make a lot of changes to my life.\n\n291\n00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:36.410\nBut I've also had to make a lot of changes\nto the technology that I use as well.\n\n292\n00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:40.210\nBecause the technology\nis completely different.\n\n293\n00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:45.570\nI had never seen a fax machine or\na checkbook in the last 20 years.\n\n294\n00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:50.876\nBut now I find myself,\nI've had people sort of asking me for\n\n295\n00:15:50.876 --> 00:15:55.880\nthings that I've never seen for\ndecades, literally.\n\n296\n00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.289\nAnd so I don't have access to the right\ntechnology to be able to make\n\n297\n00:16:00.289 --> 00:16:02.430\nthe changes that I need to make.\n\n298\n00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:07.739\nAnd in organizations, that is so true,\nis that we focus on what our outcome, and\n\n299\n00:16:07.739 --> 00:16:13.204\nwhat our vision, and what our goal is, and\nwe forget about all of the peripherals,\n\n300\n00:16:13.204 --> 00:16:16.640\nwhich is why we talk about\nengaging stakeholders.\n\n301\n00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.810\nBecause our stakeholders\ncan tell us what's needed.\n\n302\n00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.350\nBut if we try and\nignore all of our stakeholders and\n\n303\n00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:26.660\nwe dismiss them as sort of,\ntheir opinion doesn't matter,\n\n304\n00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:31.340\nthen, yeah, we'll miss something\nwhen we're implementing the change.\n\n305\n00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.310\nSo another one that we have then,\n\n306\n00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:38.720\nanother potential source of resistance,\nis poor vision.\n\n307\n00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:44.470\nPoor vision is simply not knowing what\nit is that we actually want to achieve.\n\n308\n00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.402\nHave you ever set out to do something and\nnot realized or\n\n309\n00:16:47.402 --> 00:16:49.649\nnot known what it is\nthat you wanted to do?\n\n310\n00:16:49.649 --> 00:16:53.395\nLike you've gone to the grocery store,\nyou've gone shopping without a shopping\n\n311\n00:16:53.395 --> 00:16:55.310\nlist.\n&gt;&gt; I have done that.\n\n312\n00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:55.840\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n313\n00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.220\nwhat happens?\n&gt;&gt; I get\n\n314\n00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:57.885\nmore than I need.\n\n315\n00:16:57.885 --> 00:16:59.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n316\n00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.600\n&gt;&gt; That's what happens.\n\n317\n00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n318\n00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:04.050\n&gt;&gt; No, it happens to me as well.\n\n319\n00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.700\nI do that all the time.\n\n320\n00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.550\nI will go shopping and\nnot take a list, and\n\n321\n00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.621\nthen I'm stood there, I mean,\nI stood there for hours in the store,\n\n322\n00:17:13.621 --> 00:17:16.740\nthinking about, what I am going to do for\ndinner tonight, I really don't know.\n\n323\n00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.480\nWell, what about this,\nand what about that?\n\n324\n00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:23.850\nAnd then by the time I get home, I realize\nthat I've got $500 worth of food and\n\n325\n00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:26.340\nactually still nothing to eat for\ndinner tonight.\n\n326\n00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.970\n[LAUGH] So yeah, that happens to me.\n\n327\n00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:34.610\nNot having a vision for\na change happens a lot, believe it or not.\n\n328\n00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.900\nWe have a high level vision, but\nwe don't bother to articulate that vision.\n\n329\n00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.930\nWe know that we want to move\nin a certain direction, but\n\n330\n00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.120\nwe haven't bothered to\narticulate that vision, and\n\n331\n00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.310\nwe haven't bothered to understand\nthe why we want to change.\n\n332\n00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.330\nAnd that's a huge big barrier to change.\n\n333\n00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.410\nIf somebody doesn't have a reason,\nthis is human nature, if you don't have\n\n334\n00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:01.980\na reason for doing something, then you're\nnot necessarily motivated to do it.\n\n335\n00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:06.622\nSo if you don't understand why,\nthen, well, like I said,\n\n336\n00:18:06.622 --> 00:18:09.999\nyou're not motivated to make that change.\n\n337\n00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:15.680\nLet's think about this for\na moment, why are we here?\n\n338\n00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.780\nI mean, not in some sort of\nexistential perspective, but\n\n339\n00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.370\nwhy are we stood here?\n&gt;&gt; To accomplish\n\n340\n00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:26.500\nthe goal of creating this show.\n&gt;&gt; To accomplish the goal of creating\n\n341\n00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.892\nthis show, is that why you're here?\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm here to get paid.\n\n342\n00:18:29.892 --> 00:18:31.001\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n343\n00:18:31.001 --> 00:18:32.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No,\n\n344\n00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:37.285\nof course, I am here to ensure\nthat we do get this show done.\n\n345\n00:18:37.285 --> 00:18:41.956\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm here to educate you.\n\n346\n00:18:41.956 --> 00:18:42.692\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, see?\n\n347\n00:18:42.692 --> 00:18:44.810\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm here for anyway.\n\n348\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.745\nGetting paid is a bonus,\nI'm not gonna deny that.\n\n349\n00:18:47.745 --> 00:18:49.290\n[LAUGH] Getting paid is a bonus.\n\n350\n00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.170\nBut that's why I'm here.\n\n351\n00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:54.640\nSo what I want to do when\nI'm delivering a show, and\n\n352\n00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.885\ntrust me, Ronnie feels exactly the same.\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n353\n00:18:57.885 --> 00:18:59.755\n&gt;&gt; I mean the pay's a bonus for him, too,\n\n354\n00:18:59.755 --> 00:19:00.550\ndon't worry.\n\n355\n00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:05.730\n[LAUGH] But what I'm here to\ndo is I'm here to educate you.\n\n356\n00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:10.020\nI also want to give you some information\nthat's gonna help you as you study for\n\n357\n00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.250\nyour PMP, for instance, so\nI'm here to educate you.\n\n358\n00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:17.900\nI am here to impart, whatever knowledge\nthat I happen to have garnered over\n\n359\n00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.950\nthe years,\nI'm here to share that with you.\n\n360\n00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.860\nThat's what I'm here to do,\nso that's my vision.\n\n361\n00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.680\nSo in the back of my mind,\nall the time when I'm talking,\n\n362\n00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.580\nI am considering what you're\ngoing to get out of this.\n\n363\n00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:34.170\nI'm considering the fact that I\nwant you to be able to apply this\n\n364\n00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.930\non a day-to-day basis,\nI want you to be able to use this at work.\n\n365\n00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:44.630\nSo I'm gonna give you tangible sort of\nexamples, for instance, but I'm also\n\n366\n00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:48.550\nconsidering the fact that you potentially\nwant to use this towards a test.\n\n367\n00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:51.780\nSo I'm gonna make sure that I cover all\nof the aspects that may be covered in any\n\n368\n00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.135\ntest that you might want to sit.\n\n369\n00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.425\nThat's why I'm here.\n\n370\n00:19:55.425 --> 00:19:59.260\nAnd the why I'm here drives\nwhat it is I'm going to do.\n\n371\n00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.608\nAnd so, that's my vision.\n\n372\n00:20:02.608 --> 00:20:07.000\nMy vision is to ensure that\nyou're able to pass the test,\n\n373\n00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.220\nthat you're able to use this\ninformation in any testing scenario.\n\n374\n00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.120\nBut my vision is also to teach you\nsomething, perhaps, that you may not have\n\n375\n00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:19.470\ncome across before, or something\nthat you can use in your real world.\n\n376\n00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:23.576\nIf I don't keep that perspective in\nmind throughout the entire series,\n\n377\n00:20:23.576 --> 00:20:28.151\nthroughout the entire episode, it would be\nso easy for us to go off on a tangent and\n\n378\n00:20:28.151 --> 00:20:30.600\njust start talking about something else.\n\n379\n00:20:31.695 --> 00:20:34.235\nSo I have to understand\nwhat my vision is for\n\n380\n00:20:34.235 --> 00:20:37.545\neach particular episode,\nand so does Ronnie.\n\n381\n00:20:37.545 --> 00:20:43.045\nWhen he is the subject matter expert\non any particular show, then Ronnie has\n\n382\n00:20:43.045 --> 00:20:48.230\ngot to ensure that he covers all of the\ntopics needed within that particular show.\n\n383\n00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:50.380\nThat's his vision for that show.\n\n384\n00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:55.370\nSo with any change, we have to\nensure that we understand why, and\n\n385\n00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:59.020\nwe understand the vision, and\nwe understand the clarity of the vision.\n\n386\n00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:04.050\nWe also have to do something else as\nwell in that we have to communicate that\n\n387\n00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:05.320\nvision.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n388\n00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.391\n&gt;&gt; If I'm passionate about what I do,\n\n389\n00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:09.532\nif I'm passionate about my vision,\n\n390\n00:21:09.532 --> 00:21:13.122\nand if I'm passionate about what\nit is that I want to achieve,\n\n391\n00:21:13.122 --> 00:21:15.935\nthen hopefully, and I said hopefully.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n392\n00:21:15.935 --> 00:21:17.982\n&gt;&gt; My fingers crossed on this one, but\n\n393\n00:21:17.982 --> 00:21:20.791\nhopefully that passion's\ngonna rub off on you.\n\n394\n00:21:20.791 --> 00:21:22.462\nHopefully.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe Ronnie.\n\n395\n00:21:22.462 --> 00:21:24.180\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie might, no, maybe not, maybe not,\n\n396\n00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.510\nno, no.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n397\n00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:28.567\n&gt;&gt; But hopefully some of that passion and\n\n398\n00:21:28.567 --> 00:21:33.133\nthat enthusiasm's gonna rub off on you,\nand it's gonna bring you on board with me,\n\n399\n00:21:33.133 --> 00:21:37.140\nand you're gonna be passionate and\nenthusiastic about the topic, too.\n\n400\n00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.120\nAnd that's what a good leader should do.\n\n401\n00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.733\nHe should be able to not only\ncome up with the idea and\n\n402\n00:21:44.733 --> 00:21:47.928\nbe able to expand and\nclarify the vision, but\n\n403\n00:21:47.928 --> 00:21:52.888\nthey should be able to articulate it and\nbe able to market that vision so\n\n404\n00:21:52.888 --> 00:21:57.369\nthat they bring everybody on board,\nall of the stakeholders.\n\n405\n00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.849\nSo let's take a look,\nthen, at our next barrier,\n\n406\n00:22:01.849 --> 00:22:06.452\npotential barrier to change,\nwhich is the poor measurement process.\n\n407\n00:22:07.701 --> 00:22:09.460\nI've got one thing to say to you.\n\n408\n00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:13.784\nI think so.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n409\n00:22:13.784 --> 00:22:15.281\n&gt;&gt; It's not a good measurement, all right?\n\n410\n00:22:15.281 --> 00:22:18.850\nI think so is not a good measurement.\n\n411\n00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:19.900\nDid you do something?\n\n412\n00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.680\nWell, I think I did.\n\n413\n00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.280\nNo, okay?\n\n414\n00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.250\nHow far have you got?\n\n415\n00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.310\nWell, I think I've got this far.\n\n416\n00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.350\nNo, that's not good enough.\n\n417\n00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:32.420\nWe have to be able to, when we deliver\nchange, we have to be able to deliver\n\n418\n00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:39.230\nchange that we can measure, that I am\nable to visualize, that I am able to see.\n\n419\n00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:43.070\nIt's got to be tangible, tangible change.\n\n420\n00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:48.040\nAnd so,\nthe only way to add in that tangibility\n\n421\n00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.950\nis to ensure that we're measuring change,\nwe measure success of change.\n\n422\n00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:55.820\nSometimes that can be hard, and sometimes\nwe measure success of change by using\n\n423\n00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.300\nthings like customer surveys,\nfor instance.\n\n424\n00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.500\nDid you enjoy that,\nthat particular episode, or\n\n425\n00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:06.150\ndid you enjoy the delivery\nof that episode, or\n\n426\n00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:10.170\ndid you enjoy the fact that Jo's got\na weird accent, that sort of thing, right?\n\n427\n00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.520\nSo sometimes we have to\ntake the subjective and\n\n428\n00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.580\nturn it into something objective\nin order to be able to measure it.\n\n429\n00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.261\nBut nevertheless, with any change,\n\n430\n00:23:21.261 --> 00:23:26.285\nwe have to be able to measure whether\nwe are going along the right road and\n\n431\n00:23:26.285 --> 00:23:30.840\nwhether we're achieving why, or\nwhat, we set out to achieve.\n\n432\n00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.690\nThere are four reasons\nwhy we take measurements.\n\n433\n00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:38.500\nWe measure to verify, to verify that\nwe're going in the right direction.\n\n434\n00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.680\nWe measure to justify, which is the,\nsee, I told you so, measurement.\n\n435\n00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:47.360\nWhich is the measuring to justify\nwhy we've made the change.\n\n436\n00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.267\nWe also measure to direct,\nto direct our efforts.\n\n437\n00:23:51.267 --> 00:23:55.146\nI don't think that this is going too well,\nso I'm gonna direct more effort here.\n\n438\n00:23:55.146 --> 00:23:56.730\nAnd we measure to intervene as well.\n\n439\n00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:00.746\nWe measure to Well,\nto pick up the pieces when something went\n\n440\n00:24:00.746 --> 00:24:01.319\nwrong.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n441\n00:24:01.319 --> 00:24:03.722\n&gt;&gt; To be able to detect when something's\n\n442\n00:24:03.722 --> 00:24:07.027\ngone wrong without accuracy\nin our measurements and\n\n443\n00:24:07.027 --> 00:24:11.609\nwithout actually having a measurement\nprocess, then it makes it very,\n\n444\n00:24:11.609 --> 00:24:15.540\nvery difficult for\nus to justify why we're doing something.\n\n445\n00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.890\nAnd it makes it very difficult for\n\n446\n00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:20.110\nus to actually verify that we are going\nin the right direction as well.\n\n447\n00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.480\nAnd the next one, rather the last one,\n\n448\n00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:29.720\nthat we are going to cover is\nthe failure to build change readiness.\n\n449\n00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:36.580\nHow often have things happened\nin your personal life,\n\n450\n00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:39.180\nthat happens to me all the time,\nthat you weren't expecting?\n\n451\n00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:42.066\nDaily.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, right.\n\n452\n00:24:42.066 --> 00:24:43.154\nI think [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This show.\n\n453\n00:24:43.154 --> 00:24:44.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n454\n00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.570\n&gt;&gt; In this episode right here.\n\n455\n00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:47.530\n&gt;&gt; This episode right here.\n\n456\n00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:51.307\nRonnie didn't expect I would be\ngetting on him as much as I have\n\n457\n00:24:51.307 --> 00:24:52.061\nbeen.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] l\n\n458\n00:24:52.061 --> 00:24:54.458\n&gt;&gt; But things happen that we quite often\n\n459\n00:24:54.458 --> 00:24:57.030\ndon't expect.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n460\n00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:58.770\n&gt;&gt; You go to pay your electricity bill,\n\n461\n00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:03.880\nand then you find out, because you've got\nto pay your bill, that they don't accept\n\n462\n00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.580\nthis particular type of payment anymore.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n463\n00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.290\n&gt;&gt; Or they've updated their website, and\n\n464\n00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.570\nthey haven't told you anything about it.\n\n465\n00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:14.555\nAnd I say this cuz I'm speaking\nfrom personal experience here.\n\n466\n00:25:14.555 --> 00:25:17.690\n[LAUGH] When you get this notification\nthrough your email that, by the way,\n\n467\n00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:19.100\nyou haven't paid your bill this month.\n\n468\n00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.140\nAnd you say, yes I have.\n\n469\n00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:25.190\nBecause you've changed something, but\nyou didn't bother telling anybody.\n\n470\n00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:28.220\nYou didn't do a readiness assessment.\n\n471\n00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.390\nAnd we've gotta do two types\nof readiness assessment, and\n\n472\n00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:33.575\nwe're gonna cover these in another show.\n\n473\n00:25:33.575 --> 00:25:37.365\nBut the two types of readiness\nassessment are from a user perspective,\n\n474\n00:25:37.365 --> 00:25:40.945\nassessing whether the users are ready for\nany new change.\n\n475\n00:25:40.945 --> 00:25:43.525\nBut also from a support\nperspective as well and\n\n476\n00:25:43.525 --> 00:25:47.640\nassessing whether the people that are\ngonna support this new particular change\n\n477\n00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:53.700\nare able to support it and they been\ntrained and they're ready to support it.\n\n478\n00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.900\nSo we have to assess whether\nsomebody is ready for the change,\n\n479\n00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.520\nyou don't just implement it and\nthen expect them to come onboard and\n\n480\n00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.030\nthink that everything is gonna work out\nall right, because trust me it isn't.\n\n481\n00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:08.260\nYou know ultimately when you\nthink about all of these,\n\n482\n00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.830\nmost of these are driven by people.\n\n483\n00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:14.830\nAnd most of these actually\nare in the hands of people.\n\n484\n00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:18.313\nMost of these if you wanna\ncall them derailers, but\n\n485\n00:26:18.313 --> 00:26:22.998\nthese sources of resistance\nare controlled by people.\n\n486\n00:26:22.998 --> 00:26:26.880\nSo I wanna take you back to a previous\nepisode that we recorded and\n\n487\n00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.110\ntake a look at Kotter's eight steps,\n\n488\n00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:33.720\nbecause Kotter's eight steps to\ntransformational change look at people.\n\n489\n00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.700\nOrganizational change is about\nchanging an organization, it's about\n\n490\n00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:42.270\nchanging the way that we think, it's about\nchanging the way that we do something.\n\n491\n00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.090\nWe're not talking at operational level.\n\n492\n00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:46.305\nWe're not talking about specifics.\n\n493\n00:26:46.305 --> 00:26:50.070\nBut what we're talking about is changing\na culture, we're talking about changing\n\n494\n00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:56.340\nthe way that we do something,\nwhich relies completely on the people.\n\n495\n00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:01.040\nSo if we don't engage the people,\nthen change is gonna fail.\n\n496\n00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.746\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n497\n00:27:02.746 --> 00:27:05.710\nAnd if we do engage the people,\n\n498\n00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:09.040\nthat's when you find that change\nis actually the most successful.\n\n499\n00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:13.380\nSo in this particular episode,\nwhat we did was we\n\n500\n00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:18.260\nlooked at the potential sources\nof resistance to change.\n\n501\n00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.280\nAnd when we come back in our next episode,\n\n502\n00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:24.260\nwhat we're going to do is we're going to\nlook at sort of the challenges to change,\n\n503\n00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.340\nand the things that we have to\novercome when we want to implement\n\n504\n00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.040\ntransformation or change.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo,\n\n505\n00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.160\nwell you gave us a lot to think about and\nbe able to identify,\n\n506\n00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.060\nmaybe within the organization\nthat we're serving right now.\n\n507\n00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.290\nIn terms of our work, to try and\n\n508\n00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:43.080\nidentify these potential barriers\nthat we have to actually overcome,\n\n509\n00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:46.440\nif we know that strategic change\nis the way that we are going.\n\n510\n00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.630\nBecause without that, right?\n\n511\n00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:51.660\nYou're walking into change, and\nany of these can pop up unexpectedly and\n\n512\n00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:55.220\nany particular point in time,\nwhich I can't say.\n\n513\n00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.370\nSo they can hinder us from\ndoing what we need to.\n\n514\n00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:58.880\nBut there is more to come.\n\n515\n00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.360\nAnd so\nthat means we're gonna end this episode.\n\n516\n00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:05.160\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n517\n00:28:05.160 -->

00:00:12.907\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to\n\n4\n00:00:12.907 --> 00:00:15.792\nanother great episode\nright here on It Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.792 --> 00:00:19.290\nYour'e watching the organizational\nchange management show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.810\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n7\n00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.050\ntoday, we're continuing on with the idea\nhere of course, of understanding.\n\n8\n00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.530\nNow, how to overcome different challenges\nthat we'll face as we do so and\n\n9\n00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.670\nhere to help us out, of course,\nis going to be our organizational chain\n\n10\n00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.900\nmanagement virtuoso herself,\nMrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.190\nJo, how are you doing today?\n&gt;&gt; I'm abosultely great, thank you Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.926\nI've spent my entire day just waiting to\nsee what you're gonna call me next but\n\n13\n00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:44.240\nit's always a good thing.\n\n14\n00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.470\nIt's always nice, it's always flatering.\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, so we're\n\n15\n00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.260\nat this party here where we are taking a\nlook at the idea of overcoming challenges.\n\n16\n00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.870\nWe've already talked about some barriers.\n\n17\n00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.833\nLet's do difference here or\nis there a difference?\n\n18\n00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:03.577\nOr are we just continuing on the thought?\n&gt;&gt; Well a challenge is something,\n\n19\n00:01:03.577 --> 00:01:07.900\na barrier is something that's gonna be\na complete blockage to us, basically.\n\n20\n00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.810\nSo, a barrier resistance\nis something that's\n\n21\n00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.890\nreally gonna stop us from succeeding.\n\n22\n00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.810\nA challenge is something that we have to,\nit's generally something\n\n23\n00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.560\nthat would be internal,\nsomething that we would have to overcome.\n\n24\n00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.580\nIt's not gonna stop us from succeeding but\nit's gonna, well,\n\n25\n00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.660\nit's gonna be a little bit difficult.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n26\n00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n27\n00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.470\nit's going to maybe add in some complexity\nor maybe it might delay the outcome.\n\n28\n00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.490\nSo we want to, well,\nin order to implement any change,\n\n29\n00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.910\nwe want to really consider\nwhat our challenges may be.\n\n30\n00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.750\nResistance is generally people.\n\n31\n00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.450\nAnd you know we talked about\nthis in our last episode.\n\n32\n00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.630\nWe talked about resistance.\n\n33\n00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.500\nWe talked about identifying resistance.\n\n34\n00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.540\nFor the most part,\nresistance is generally people.\n\n35\n00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.920\nWhereas our challenges,\nwell, it's not just people.\n\n36\n00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.610\nOur challenges look at allocating.\n\n37\n00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.580\nIt's about really having\nthe process right.\n\n38\n00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.770\nIt's looking at allocating\nour responsibilities.\n\n39\n00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.210\nIt's looking at how our people\nactually talk to each other.\n\n40\n00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.640\nIt's looking at how we, well,\n\n41\n00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.650\nhow we engage with all of\nthe people that we need to.\n\n42\n00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.930\nSo it really is sources of overcoming\nthat resistance and those challenges.\n\n43\n00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.640\nThey are heavily intertwined, really,\nreally, heavily intertwined and for\n\n44\n00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.650\nthe most part, I don't really care,\nlet's be honest.\n\n45\n00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.030\nWhether you mix them up,\nwhether you confuse them or not,\n\n46\n00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.801\nit doesn't really matter to me.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n47\n00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:37.712\n&gt;&gt; And ultimately,\n\n48\n00:02:37.712 --> 00:02:39.654\nwe just know we want to overcome them,\n\n49\n00:02:39.654 --> 00:02:40.780\nlet's face it.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n50\n00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.560\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's as simple as that.\n\n51\n00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.460\nIf I think about the challenges that\nwe have got identified within PMP,\n\n52\n00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.420\nwithin that certificate,\nwe look at things like lack of synergy.\n\n53\n00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.990\nAnd I've put them on a screen\nin front of you right now.\n\n54\n00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.980\nWe look at lack of synergy\nbetween the people\n\n55\n00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.240\nthat are being affected by the change and\nthose that are implementing the change.\n\n56\n00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.530\nWe look at lack of\nstakeholder engagement and\n\n57\n00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.390\nwe also look at inability to\ndefine sponsor responsibilities.\n\n58\n00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.910\nSo what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm really going to talk about each one of\n\n59\n00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.000\nthese.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n60\n00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.880\n&gt;&gt; In isolation.\n\n61\n00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.840\nWe cannot know, let's face it.\n\n62\n00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.000\nWe cannot just look at any challenge\nin isolation because well,\n\n63\n00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.330\na project, a change,\ndoesn't get implemented in isolation.\n\n64\n00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:37.060\nYes, sure, we want to implement individual\nimprovements in an incremental way.\n\n65\n00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.410\nBut you can't ignore everything\nelse that's happening around you.\n\n66\n00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.540\nSo, I don't like to use the word isolation\nbecause it leads to working in silos.\n\n67\n00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.410\nAnd that can be really,\nreally dangerous for an organization.\n\n68\n00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.270\nI've come across way too many\norganizations where we are so\n\n69\n00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.190\nconcerned with what we're doing and\nhow we're doing it,\n\n70\n00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.340\nwithout any perspective on\nwhat everybody else is doing.\n\n71\n00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.180\nAnd if I change the way that I work,\nit's gonna affect you.\n\n72\n00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.580\nIf I change the way that I work, it's\ngoing to affect our director for the show.\n\n73\n00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.580\nIf I change the way that I work, it's\ngoing to affect our marketing people who\n\n74\n00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.840\nmay market these particular show or\nthis particular episode.\n\n75\n00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.240\nSo, there are so many other factors\njust to producing this show,\n\n76\n00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.900\nit's not just about me and what I know,\nit's about so many other different things.\n\n77\n00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.150\nAnd yet,\nit's really easy to work in silos and\n\n78\n00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.860\nit's really easy to implement the change\nin silos and so, that is a big challenge.\n\n79\n00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.060\nSo, let's take a look\nthen at these first one.\n\n80\n00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.570\nThese first one here looks at that lack\nof synergy between the affected group and\n\n81\n00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.250\nthe dominant individuals\nwithin this change.\n\n82\n00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.530\nWhy dominant individuals?\n\n83\n00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.790\nI mean the people that\nare driving the change and\n\n84\n00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.470\nthe people that are leading the change.\n\n85\n00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.830\nSo, I wanna ask a question.\n\n86\n00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.310\nAnd I'm gonna ask the question of Ronnie.\n\n87\n00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.230\nBut I'm really gonna\nask a question of you.\n\n88\n00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.760\nBecause I'm pretty sure that\nwe've all come across this.\n\n89\n00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.470\nHas somebody in your career\never implemented a change\n\n90\n00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.720\nthat well, wasn't communicated to you?\n\n91\n00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.700\nAnd actually directly affected you?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n92\n00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.940\nYes I have.\n\n93\n00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.480\nAs these changes were actually\nimplemented, it was not known, so\n\n94\n00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.970\nI continued on in the same\ndirection I was continuing on and\n\n95\n00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.770\nthen they said, here the,\nwe didn't tell you, we forgot to tell you,\n\n96\n00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.380\nthis is the way it should have been done.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n97\n00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.670\nhow did you feel about that?\n&gt;&gt; I felt confused because I thought I was\n\n98\n00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.040\ndoing the right thing and\nthen found out I've been doing it wrong.\n\n99\n00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.650\nAnd not only that I've been doing it wrong\nfor a while, so I had to go back and\n\n100\n00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.090\nactually redo a couple of\ndifferent things to try and\n\n101\n00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.600\nbring everything that I've done in\nalignment in the past that I have done.\n\n102\n00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.320\nAnd it's not that it was really difficult\nbut it took additional time, so\n\n103\n00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.500\nit felt like time that was wasted\nif I would've known about it.\n\n104\n00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.070\n&gt;&gt; Right and it's not just, I mean,\n\n105\n00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.700\nyou're more generous than I am.\n\n106\n00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.200\nRonnie is actually a nicer person than me.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n107\n00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.210\n&gt;&gt; And this is why I'm able to rib him so\n\n108\n00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.840\nmuch, to be honest because\nhe's a lot nicer than I am.\n\n109\n00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.620\nCuz I've had things like\nthat happen to me and\n\n110\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.270\nI can honestly say that I would never\ndescribe myself as just confused.\n\n111\n00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.302\nReady to kill maybe.\n\n112\n00:06:16.302 --> 00:06:16.814\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n113\n00:06:16.814 --> 00:06:18.484\n&gt;&gt; But not just confused.\n\n114\n00:06:18.484 --> 00:06:20.584\nThis is why Ronnie's a nicer person.\n\n115\n00:06:20.584 --> 00:06:22.714\nDon't ever get on my bad side.\n\n116\n00:06:22.714 --> 00:06:23.564\nYou can get on his.\n\n117\n00:06:23.564 --> 00:06:24.124\nHe's all right.\n\n118\n00:06:24.124 --> 00:06:25.830\nHe's very tolerant like that.\n\n119\n00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.420\nBut you see, I've had this happen to me.\n\n120\n00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.510\nAnd it happens to me and I mentioned\nin a previous episode about you've\n\n121\n00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.856\ngotta pay your utility bill,\nyour electricity bill.\n\n122\n00:06:35.856 --> 00:06:39.540\nAnd find out that you got an email to say\nyou haven't paid your electricity bill\n\n123\n00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.970\nbecause somebody's changed their website.\n\n124\n00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.380\nOr they've changed the way that they\nprocess something and unfortunately,\n\n125\n00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.600\nthey haven't bothered telling you.\n\n126\n00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.690\nAnd then what happens is that you end\nup with a bill that's not paid, that\n\n127\n00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.380\nyou could potentially get a bad mark on\nyour credit rating or your credit score.\n\n128\n00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.420\nOr because somebody else did\nsomething that affected you and\n\n129\n00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.240\nthey didn't bother telling\nyou anything about it.\n\n130\n00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.730\nNow I don't just get confused,\nI get really irritated.\n\n131\n00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.840\nReally, really irritated, especially\nwhen it's something as serious as that.\n\n132\n00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.950\nBut then in a working environment,\nthis will happen more often than we care\n\n133\n00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:21.020\nto admit where we just wasted, I mean\nthe last four weeks doing something.\n\n134\n00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.990\nOnly to be told that actually, well,\n\n135\n00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.560\nwe chose the way that we\nworked four weeks ago.\n\n136\n00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.720\nAnd really we shouldn't have\nbeen doing it like that anymore.\n\n137\n00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.920\nAnd that document that\nyou've just produced,\n\n138\n00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.470\nwe don't need it or\nthat document that you just produced,\n\n139\n00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.300\nyou're gonna have to input all of\nthat data into another system there.\n\n140\n00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.710\nThat's a waste of effort, it's a waste of\n\n141\n00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:49.210\nmy time but more importantly,\nit's a waste of money.\n\n142\n00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.197\nBecause somebody's paying me and\n\n143\n00:07:51.197 --> 00:07:52.750\nsomebody's been paying me to\ncomplete this particular document.\n\n144\n00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:57.667\nAnd so therefore, the last week's\nwages that I've just earned is now,\n\n145\n00:07:57.667 --> 00:08:02.040\nwell, just money that's been\nthrown out of the window.\n\n146\n00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.611\nThrown down the drain,\nhowever you want to describe it.\n\n147\n00:08:05.611 --> 00:08:10.309\nIf we work in silos, and I was just\ntalking about marketing there, and\n\n148\n00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:12.550\nabout not marketing the change.\n\n149\n00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:18.554\nBut if we work in silos, this is\nwhat happens, we work inefficiently.\n\n150\n00:08:18.554 --> 00:08:22.220\nThe other thing that I wanna mention is,\nI asked Ronnie how he felt.\n\n151\n00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.501\nCuz that's really important.\n\n152\n00:08:25.501 --> 00:08:29.672\nWhy is how you feel important to this?\n&gt;&gt; It's part\n\n153\n00:08:29.672 --> 00:08:32.523\nof motivational factors to whether or\nnot we're\n\n154\n00:08:32.523 --> 00:08:35.190\ngoing to accept what's coming up.\n&gt;&gt; It's not just\n\n155\n00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.598\nabout the acceptance.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n156\n00:08:36.598 --> 00:08:39.212\n&gt;&gt; But yes it's just about motivational\n\n157\n00:08:39.212 --> 00:08:40.910\nfactors.\n\n158\n00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:46.756\nIt's about these motivational factors for\nyou as an individual.\n\n159\n00:08:46.756 --> 00:08:50.180\nIf you are not motivated, if you're\nfeeling as though that you have been\n\n160\n00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.290\nmessed around whomever,\nthen you're not gonna give 100%.\n\n161\n00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:57.294\nYou're not gonna give 100%\ncommitment to the change,\n\n162\n00:08:57.294 --> 00:09:01.389\nand you're not gonna give\n100% commitment to your job.\n\n163\n00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:04.919\nIf you feel as though you're being messed\naround you're not gonna give it 100%.\n\n164\n00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.658\nWhen we're implementing a change,\nno matter how big the change is, the one\n\n165\n00:09:10.658 --> 00:09:15.305\nthing that we need is for the recipients\nof that change to be completely on board.\n\n166\n00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:18.650\nWe need them to test out all\nof the potential scenarios.\n\n167\n00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.139\nAnd in some instances,\n\n168\n00:09:20.139 --> 00:09:24.241\nwe need them to actually physically\ntest the technology as well.\n\n169\n00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:28.740\nIf that person's not fully on board,\nthey're then not going to do any testing.\n\n170\n00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.010\nI have several confessions to make here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n171\n00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.174\n&gt;&gt; So quite often,\n\n172\n00:09:34.174 --> 00:09:38.915\nI will think to myself that it's\na great idea to be on a development or\n\n173\n00:09:38.915 --> 00:09:42.656\nto be on a team,\nI'll put my hand up for beta testing or\n\n174\n00:09:42.656 --> 00:09:48.390\nbeta testing as you call it, and\nI'll say yes, okay I'll do something.\n\n175\n00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.393\nAnd then I get given the latest\nversion of an operating system and\n\n176\n00:09:51.393 --> 00:09:53.331\nthen don't do anything with it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n177\n00:09:53.331 --> 00:09:55.639\n&gt;&gt; I don't actually do any testing, and\n\n178\n00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:58.922\nI certainly don't feedback\nthe results to anybody.\n\n179\n00:09:58.922 --> 00:09:59.822\nYou're probably\n\n180\n00:09:59.822 --> 00:10:01.610\nnot as guilty of that as I am.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n181\n00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.466\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, see, cuz Ronnie's too honest.\n\n182\n00:10:03.466 --> 00:10:05.783\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n183\n00:10:05.783 --> 00:10:07.243\n&gt;&gt; That's all I've got to say really,\n\n184\n00:10:07.243 --> 00:10:07.910\non that point.\n\n185\n00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:11.130\nRonnie, I told you,\nhe was too nice, he's too honest.\n\n186\n00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:15.065\nBut I will, [LAUGH] I will agree to do\na beta test on an operating system,\n\n187\n00:10:15.065 --> 00:10:16.934\njust because it gives me the first\n\n188\n00:10:16.934 --> 00:10:19.328\nrelease of that operating system.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n189\n00:10:19.328 --> 00:10:21.188\n&gt;&gt; This is the danger of being an early\n\n190\n00:10:21.188 --> 00:10:22.190\nadopter.\n\n191\n00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.449\nBut the fact of the matter is I'm not\ngonna give it 100%, because maybe\n\n192\n00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:31.113\nit's not been marketed to me correctly,\nit's not been sold to me correctly, and\n\n193\n00:10:31.113 --> 00:10:35.871\ntherefore I'm not completely on board with\nit, but I'm just going along with it.\n\n194\n00:10:35.871 --> 00:10:40.477\nWe have to get the synergy right between\nthe people that are delivering the change\n\n195\n00:10:40.477 --> 00:10:44.120\nand the people that\nare receiving the change.\n\n196\n00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:49.995\nSo we have to get all of our stakeholders,\nwell, talk in the same language.\n\n197\n00:10:49.995 --> 00:10:54.230\nWe've all got to be working towards\nthat higher goal and that higher vision.\n\n198\n00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:58.975\nAnd remember in a previous episode, I\ntalked about communicating the vision, and\n\n199\n00:10:58.975 --> 00:11:02.388\nI talked about understanding\nwhy we're doing something.\n\n200\n00:11:02.388 --> 00:11:06.782\nIf I'm driving change, and I am leading\nchange, then I have to be able to\n\n201\n00:11:06.782 --> 00:11:12.170\narticulate why we are doing something to\nthe person that's receiving the change.\n\n202\n00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:18.118\nAnd then that person that's receiving\nthe change, well they've got to be able\n\n203\n00:11:18.118 --> 00:11:24.353\nto articulate to me whether I've actually\nachieved what it is I set out to achieve.\n\n204\n00:11:24.353 --> 00:11:28.958\nIn a previous episode,\nI asked Ronnie why he was here, basically.\n\n205\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:29.639\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n206\n00:11:29.639 --> 00:11:30.392\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n207\n00:11:30.392 --> 00:11:33.683\nthen I went on to say that while I'm here,\n\n208\n00:11:33.683 --> 00:11:39.720\nis to actually impart some of my knowledge\nto be able to teach you what I know.\n\n209\n00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.531\nThat's the reason why I am here.\n\n210\n00:11:42.531 --> 00:11:44.410\nBut I don't know whether I've done that or\nnot.\n\n211\n00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.615\nI know what I'm talking about sure.\n\n212\n00:11:47.615 --> 00:11:49.620\nBut I don't know whether\nyou've understood it.\n\n213\n00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.431\nI don't know whether you've\nreceived the information and\n\n214\n00:11:53.431 --> 00:11:56.395\nI don't know whether you've received\nthen potentially this change.\n\n215\n00:11:56.395 --> 00:11:58.040\nCuz this is a change right?\n\n216\n00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.360\nIt's new information for you.\n\n217\n00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.880\nIt's something that's changed.\n\n218\n00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:06.398\nSomething that's improved and I don't\nknow whether you've understood that.\n\n219\n00:12:06.398 --> 00:12:11.010\nSo there could potentially be a lack\nof synergy between you and me.\n\n220\n00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.605\nBecause I don't know whether you're\nunderstanding everything that I'm\n\n221\n00:12:15.605 --> 00:12:16.378\ntalking about.\n\n222\n00:12:16.378 --> 00:12:20.400\nThis is why Ronnie's here as well,\nbecause Ronnie's here as my sanity check.\n\n223\n00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.739\nRonnie's here to say, I haven't got\na clue what you were talking about.\n\n224\n00:12:23.739 --> 00:12:25.914\nAnd if I haven't got a clue\nwhat you were talking about,\n\n225\n00:12:25.914 --> 00:12:28.450\nthen neither can anybody\nelse understand it either.\n\n226\n00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.206\nSo that's why Ronnie's here.\n\n227\n00:12:30.206 --> 00:12:36.910\nBut Ronnie's here to actually try and\nbring in some synergy between you and me.\n\n228\n00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.926\nThat's why he's here.\n\n229\n00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:42.456\nSo, in order to make\nany change successful,\n\n230\n00:12:42.456 --> 00:12:47.050\nwe have to have that synergy between,\nwell, the person delivering the change and\n\n231\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.330\nthe person receiving the change, too.\n\n232\n00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:53.776\nAnd that means, and\nthat's going to bring into our next,\n\n233\n00:12:53.776 --> 00:12:56.315\nif we go back to that slide again,\n\n234\n00:12:56.315 --> 00:13:02.160\nit's going to bring into our next\nfactor which is stakeholder engagement.\n\n235\n00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.890\nI have to engage all of my stakeholders.\n\n236\n00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:11.651\nBaring in mind that all of my\nstakeholders are gonna have different\n\n237\n00:13:11.651 --> 00:13:13.613\nlevel of responsibility.\n\n238\n00:13:13.613 --> 00:13:15.727\nHave you ever heard of a RACI chart?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n239\n00:13:15.727 --> 00:13:17.041\nI have.\n&gt;&gt; You\n\n240\n00:13:17.041 --> 00:13:17.760\nhave.\n&gt;&gt; I have.\n\n241\n00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.510\n&gt;&gt; I know he has, cuz I've shown him too.\n\n242\n00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:25.876\nA RACI chart is something where we simply\nlist our stakeholders for any endeavor,\n\n243\n00:13:25.876 --> 00:13:30.950\nand then we will define or allocate our\nresponsibility to our stakeholders.\n\n244\n00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:34.161\nAnd that responsibility might be,\nthey're responsible for\n\n245\n00:13:34.161 --> 00:13:38.481\nperforming a certain action, or a certain\nactivity or they might be accountable,\n\n246\n00:13:38.481 --> 00:13:40.660\nwhich means that they own that activity.\n\n247\n00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:44.001\nThey don't necessarily perform\nthe activity, but they own it.\n\n248\n00:13:44.001 --> 00:13:48.493\nAnd then they might be consulted within\na particular activity, and they might be\n\n249\n00:13:48.493 --> 00:13:53.005\ninformed, are we going to tell them about\nthe results of a particular activity?\n\n250\n00:13:53.005 --> 00:13:59.710\nWe'll tell you that RACI chart should\nhappen for every single change.\n\n251\n00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:03.261\nEvery time you implement a change,\nI want to see your RACI chart,\n\n252\n00:14:03.261 --> 00:14:06.750\nI want to see a list of\nwho your stakeholders are?\n\n253\n00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.363\nRemember a stakeholder is what Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; It is anyone who has\n\n254\n00:14:10.363 --> 00:14:13.497\nan interest.\n&gt;&gt; Anyone who has an interest including my\n\n255\n00:14:13.497 --> 00:14:15.801\nnosy neighbor,\nshe's a stakeholder in my life.\n\n256\n00:14:15.801 --> 00:14:19.462\nI mean I wish she wasn't but she is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n257\n00:14:19.462 --> 00:14:20.592\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so,\n\n258\n00:14:20.592 --> 00:14:26.000\nI want to see a chart for any change,\nI want to see a RACI chart.\n\n259\n00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.008\nAnd you can apply this to any\nparticular process yourself,\n\n260\n00:14:29.008 --> 00:14:32.137\nit doesn't have to be necessarily\nchange management, but,\n\n261\n00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:35.043\nyou want to have a chart for\nwho is actually accountable?\n\n262\n00:14:35.043 --> 00:14:38.280\nWho makes sure that something happens?\n\n263\n00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.205\nWho makes sure that\nthe bills are paid at home?\n\n264\n00:14:41.205 --> 00:14:45.460\nAnd then who actually pays them,\nthat's the responsible person.\n\n265\n00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.790\nAnd who do you tell, generally the bank\nmanager, or who do you consult rather,\n\n266\n00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.405\nwell it's the bank manager,\n\n267\n00:14:51.405 --> 00:14:54.330\nhave I got enough money in\nmy account to pay the bills?\n\n268\n00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.490\nAnd who do you inform?\n\n269\n00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:00.711\nWell anybody else that might want to spend\nthe money like the kids generally, right?\n\n270\n00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:02.640\nNo we haven't got any money this month.\n\n271\n00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.667\nYou can do a RACI chart for\nabsolutely anything.\n\n272\n00:15:06.667 --> 00:15:09.883\nBut we'll definitely tell you that you\nshould ensure that your stakeholders\n\n273\n00:15:09.883 --> 00:15:10.930\nare engaged.\n\n274\n00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.707\nAnd so in order to do that,\nyou have to identify your stakeholders.\n\n275\n00:15:14.707 --> 00:15:20.870\nYou also have to identify as to whether\nyour stakeholders are influencing or not.\n\n276\n00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.238\nBecause the ones that are influencing,\nwell,\n\n277\n00:15:24.238 --> 00:15:27.531\nthese are the ones that\nwe need to get on board.\n\n278\n00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:32.300\nAnd it's not just a case of consulting\nwith them, or making them responsible.\n\n279\n00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:37.243\nWhen I talk about influencing,\nI'm talking about whether they drive\n\n280\n00:15:37.243 --> 00:15:42.352\nany particular activity, because you\nsee I can make you responsible for\n\n281\n00:15:42.352 --> 00:15:46.036\nsomething, yeah,\nI could make you responsible for\n\n282\n00:15:46.036 --> 00:15:51.256\nmonitoring how long I'm talking for\nin this particular episode, yeah?\n\n283\n00:15:51.256 --> 00:15:58.590\nBut if you're not engaged, then how\nmuch attention are you going to pay?\n\n284\n00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.017\nNot very much attention at all.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n285\n00:16:00.017 --> 00:16:03.980\nit doesn't matter whether you're\nresponsible or not if you're not engaged.\n\n286\n00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:10.117\nYou see, this is why I have to know\nwhat your influencing factor is.\n\n287\n00:16:10.117 --> 00:16:10.790\nBy the way, Ronnie's just\n\n288\n00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:11.372\nlooked at the clock.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n289\n00:16:11.372 --> 00:16:13.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That was hilarious.\n\n290\n00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.467\nI have to know what your\ninfluencing factor is.\n\n291\n00:16:16.467 --> 00:16:21.101\nI want to know whether you are driving\na particular activity, whether you have\n\n292\n00:16:21.101 --> 00:16:26.160\ncontrol over a particular activity, or\nif I'm just giving you responsibility.\n\n293\n00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:32.889\nBut actually, you could put up resistance,\nbecause you could choose not to do it.\n\n294\n00:16:32.889 --> 00:16:35.913\nSo it's not just enough for\nme to map out that racey John and\n\n295\n00:16:35.913 --> 00:16:38.013\nto say I'm giving you responsiblity for\n\n296\n00:16:38.013 --> 00:16:41.680\nsomething, I've also gotta check\nyour level of engagement as well.\n\n297\n00:16:42.735 --> 00:16:46.554\nBecause I could be giving you\nresponsibility for something that you\n\n298\n00:16:46.554 --> 00:16:49.151\nmight not want to undertake.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n299\n00:16:49.151 --> 00:16:50.165\n&gt;&gt; And if I do that,\n\n300\n00:16:50.165 --> 00:16:54.400\nthen you're probably gonna\nbecome a source of resistance.\n\n301\n00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.829\nRonnie, you've got kids.\n&gt;&gt; I do,\n\n302\n00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:58.456\nI have one.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you know what it's like when\n\n303\n00:16:58.456 --> 00:17:01.613\nyou give your daughter something\nthat she doesn't wanna do.\n\n304\n00:17:01.613 --> 00:17:02.128\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n305\n00:17:02.128 --> 00:17:04.672\nI do, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; She becomes a source of\n\n306\n00:17:04.672 --> 00:17:07.659\nresistance, right?\n&gt;&gt; She's always a source of resistance in\n\n307\n00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:10.460\nterms of anything that I need her to do.\n\n308\n00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.751\nAnything she wants to do.\nShe's absolutely not a source\n\n309\n00:17:12.751 --> 00:17:16.463\nof resistance, so I'm fine [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] She's not always a source of\n\n310\n00:17:16.463 --> 00:17:17.013\nresistance.\n\n311\n00:17:17.013 --> 00:17:18.590\nShe's really sweet.\n\n312\n00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:21.230\nShe's not always.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n313\n00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:22.780\n&gt;&gt; But I've been there, got that t-shirt.\n\n314\n00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:27.405\nAnd I know that sometimes they are,\nbut essentially, anybody could become\n\n315\n00:17:27.405 --> 00:17:28.979\na source of resistance.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n316\n00:17:28.979 --> 00:17:31.602\n&gt;&gt; This is why, again, it goes back to got\n\n317\n00:17:31.602 --> 00:17:36.373\nus eight steps in creating a need,\ncreating a sense of urgency and being\n\n318\n00:17:36.373 --> 00:17:41.460\nable to ensure that your stakeholders\nare on board with that change.\n\n319\n00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.860\nSo this is why we talk about engagement.\n\n320\n00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.630\nIt’s not just about\nallocating responsibilities.\n\n321\n00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.371\nIt’s also about engagement.\n\n322\n00:17:47.371 --> 00:17:50.260\nAnd so\nthat’s something that we have to achieve.\n\n323\n00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.210\nSo you asked right at the beginning\nabout the challenges and the resistance.\n\n324\n00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.364\nI like to think of these\nas more of achievements,\n\n325\n00:17:55.364 --> 00:17:57.370\nthese are the things\nthat we have to achieve.\n\n326\n00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:02.251\nAnd then the other thing,\nthe last one on this particular slide,\n\n327\n00:18:02.251 --> 00:18:05.019\nare the sponsor responsibilities.\n\n328\n00:18:05.019 --> 00:18:07.610\nDo you remember who the sponsor was?\n\n329\n00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:10.987\nI know that we defined it in\nanother episode a long time ago.\n\n330\n00:18:10.987 --> 00:18:15.139\n&gt;&gt; The sponsor was the person that is more\n\n331\n00:18:15.139 --> 00:18:19.458\nof a champion with the project?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I like that, yeah,\n\n332\n00:18:19.458 --> 00:18:21.530\nI use the word figurehead.\n&gt;&gt; Figurehead, yeah.\n\n333\n00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.469\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like the word champion as well,\n\n334\n00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:24.906\nthat's who your sponsor is.\n\n335\n00:18:24.906 --> 00:18:27.770\nSo think about sponsor\nresponsibilities too.\n\n336\n00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.999\nSo, do you want to give\nresponsibilities to your sponsor?\n\n337\n00:18:32.769 --> 00:18:35.640\nThey might not have the time to do them.\n\n338\n00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:40.476\nThey might not actually have the time\nto undertake any of those activities\n\n339\n00:18:40.476 --> 00:18:42.510\nthat you've asked them to do.\n\n340\n00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.442\nThey might not even have the time to check\nwhether those activities are being done,\n\n341\n00:18:46.442 --> 00:18:48.644\nif they've delegated\nthem to somebody else.\n\n342\n00:18:48.644 --> 00:18:51.374\nSo think about what you\ngive to your sponsors and\n\n343\n00:18:51.374 --> 00:18:55.670\nthink about the fact that they might\nnot actually be able to do anything.\n\n344\n00:18:55.670 --> 00:19:00.196\nAnd in a lot of successful change,\nwhat we'll do is we have our sponsor, but\n\n345\n00:19:00.196 --> 00:19:03.807\nthe change manager whoever is\ntaking the leadership role for\n\n346\n00:19:03.807 --> 00:19:07.880\nthe change will actually maybe\nperform more of the communication.\n\n347\n00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.422\nBut then send them to the sponsor,\nsend that email to the sponsor and\n\n348\n00:19:11.422 --> 00:19:15.024\nget the sponsor to email it out or\nmaybe send a script to the sponsor and\n\n349\n00:19:15.024 --> 00:19:17.656\nget the sponsor to record a video,\nfor instance.\n\n350\n00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:21.066\nSo think about the sponsor\nresponsibilities and\n\n351\n00:19:21.066 --> 00:19:25.590\nthink about exactly what you\nwant to give to your sponsor.\n\n352\n00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:29.958\nAnd bearing in mind that the sponsor\nmay just be a figurehead,\n\n353\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:31.806\nhe may just be a champion,\n\n354\n00:19:31.806 --> 00:19:37.270\nit might not necessarily be somebody\nthat you are going to engage with fully.\n\n355\n00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:43.477\nAnd somebody who is going to perform\nactivities within that particular change.\n\n356\n00:19:43.477 --> 00:19:46.243\nIf I take a look at this slide\nthat I've got right now, and\n\n357\n00:19:46.243 --> 00:19:49.080\nyou'll see that we've got\ndifferent types of sponsors.\n\n358\n00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.680\nWe've got the executive sponsor who is\nmost definitely going to be a figurehead.\n\n359\n00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.143\nIf you're giving them\nspecific activities to do,\n\n360\n00:19:55.143 --> 00:19:57.910\nyou better make sure it's\na high level activity.\n\n361\n00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:02.293\nYou better make sure that you've given\nthem the lead and what to do, and\n\n362\n00:20:02.293 --> 00:20:07.061\nyou better make sure that it's something\nthat belongs at that level as well.\n\n363\n00:20:07.061 --> 00:20:12.760\nAnd then you've got group sponsors at\nmid-level and sort of first level.\n\n364\n00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:17.596\nSo when it says first level, what we\nmean here are those sort of individual\n\n365\n00:20:17.596 --> 00:20:22.432\nteam managers, whereas you might have\nyour group sponsors in mid-level\n\n366\n00:20:22.432 --> 00:20:25.320\nmight be your sort of divisional managers.\n\n367\n00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:30.280\nAccountability always goes upwards,\nbut responsibility comes downwards.\n\n368\n00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.164\nIn other words, if you're the executive\nsponsor, you're going to delegate, but\n\n369\n00:20:34.164 --> 00:20:35.380\nyou will take ownership.\n\n370\n00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:40.361\nOwnership always belongs at the senior\nlevel, but the responsibility,\n\n371\n00:20:40.361 --> 00:20:44.550\nit generally filters down to\nthe lower levels of management.\n\n372\n00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:51.297\nIrrespective of who your sponsors are,\nwe have to make sure that\n\n373\n00:20:51.297 --> 00:20:56.060\nyou have given the right sets\nof activities to those sponsors.\n\n374\n00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:00.968\nAnd as I've already said,\ndon't give your senior sponsors something\n\n375\n00:21:00.968 --> 00:21:04.250\nto do that they're not\ngoing to want to take.\n\n376\n00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:07.675\nBecause again, they're human,\nexactly the same as Ronnie,\n\n377\n00:21:07.675 --> 00:21:09.170\nis exactly the same as I am.\n\n378\n00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:13.241\nIf you give me something that I don't want\nto do, then I'm going to become a source\n\n379\n00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:16.080\nof resistance,\njust like Ronnie's daughter, right?\n\n380\n00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:22.161\nSo what we've done in this particular\nepisode is, we have looked at challenges,\n\n381\n00:21:22.161 --> 00:21:26.420\nor I like to call them achievements,\ncuz I want to be positive about this.\n\n382\n00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.330\nSo we've looked at the achievements.\n\n383\n00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.016\nWhat it is we've really\ngot to insure happens to\n\n384\n00:21:32.016 --> 00:21:36.177\nenable transformational\nsuccess with our changes.\n\n385\n00:21:36.177 --> 00:21:39.627\nSo, on our next episode,\nwhen you join us again,\n\n386\n00:21:39.627 --> 00:21:44.540\nwe are going to look at change\nmanagement at the portfolio level.\n\n387\n00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.626\nAnd we're going to run\nthe next few episodes,\n\n388\n00:21:46.626 --> 00:21:48.830\nwe're going to look at\nPortfolio level change.\n\n389\n00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:52.475\nWe're going to look at Program level\nchange, and we're going to look at\n\n390\n00:21:52.475 --> 00:21:57.398\nspecific project-level change as well.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, thank you for helping\n\n391\n00:21:57.398 --> 00:22:01.346\nus to understand more of this idea of the\nchallenges that we definitely have to meet\n\n392\n00:22:01.346 --> 00:22:05.427\nand overcome, if we're going to implement\nsome type of transformational change.\n\n393\n00:22:05.427 --> 00:22:08.066\nThe very fact is,\nthere's no bypass to this,\n\n394\n00:22:08.066 --> 00:22:10.600\nwe can't hop over any of these things.\n\n395\n00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.943\nIt's very important that\nwe encounter each one, and\n\n396\n00:22:12.943 --> 00:22:16.239\nthat we overcome them to help us to\nachieve the level of change that we want.\n\n397\n00:22:16.239 --> 00:22:20.730\nThere is more to come in Organizational\nChange, but that is for another episode.\n\n398\n00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:25.361\nSo signing off for IT ProTV, I’m your\nhost Ronnie Wong and I’m Jo Peacock.\n\n399\n00:22:25.361 --> 00:22:29.660\nStay tuned right here for more of the\nOrganizational Change Management episodes.\n\n400\n00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:36.470\n[MUSIC]\n\n401\n00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:40.497\nThank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:13.425\nITPROTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another\n\n4\n00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:15.677\ngreat episode right here on ITPROTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.677 --> 00:00:18.820\nYou're watching\nthe Organizational Change Management show.\n\n6\n00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.612\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today,\n\n7\n00:00:20.612 --> 00:00:24.100\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\nportfolio change management.\n\n8\n00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.361\nAnd here to help us once again, with this\nidea of organizational change is gonna be\n\n9\n00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.482\nour cracker jack herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:30.482 --> 00:00:33.765\nJo welcome back to the show,\nhow are you doing?\n\n11\n00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:36.184\n&gt;&gt; I'm stunned.\n\n12\n00:00:36.184 --> 00:00:38.110\nYeah, I'm fine, thank you, Ronnie,.\n\n13\n00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.100\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing well.\n\n14\n00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.770\n&gt;&gt; So crackerjack was a TV program in\n\n15\n00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.690\nthe UK when I was a small child.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n16\n00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.497\n&gt;&gt; And it only ever comes on at Friday at\n\n17\n00:00:50.497 --> 00:00:52.817\nfive to five.\n&gt;&gt; And?\n\n18\n00:00:52.817 --> 00:00:53.640\n&gt;&gt; That was it really.\n\n19\n00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.106\nAnd it was kind of just crazy.\n\n20\n00:00:55.106 --> 00:00:57.850\nIt was just a kid show where\nthey just did all things.\n\n21\n00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.529\nSo unless it's Friday and\n\n22\n00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:03.467\nit's five to five, then-\n&gt;&gt; For us-\n\n23\n00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:05.578\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n24\n00:01:05.578 --> 00:01:08.108\n&gt;&gt; On the state side, Crackerjack is\n\n25\n00:01:08.108 --> 00:01:12.194\na term for ace or master of something.\n&gt;&gt; I thought it was a crack of\n\n26\n00:01:12.194 --> 00:01:14.910\npopcorn.\n&gt;&gt; And it could be a box of popcorn as\n\n27\n00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.194\nwell Caramelized popcorn,\nbut nonethe less, good.\n\n28\n00:01:18.194 --> 00:01:21.385\nSo Jo, here we are- [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We are beginning the idea of\n\n29\n00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:23.030\nOrganizational Change Manager.\n\n30\n00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.650\nWe are, of course, talking about\nportfolio change management now.\n\n31\n00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.090\nSo Jo, what we heading in when we\nstart talking about this idea?\n\n32\n00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.075\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're not talking about popcorn,\n\n33\n00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:33.129\nthat will come later.\n\n34\n00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:37.296\nAlthough if you want to sit here and have\nsome popcorn while you're watching our\n\n35\n00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:40.030\nshow, then Yeah, we'd love for\nyou to share it.\n\n36\n00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.940\nYeah, we would like some here as well,\nthat would be great.\n\n37\n00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.288\nI prefer the salted, [LAUGH].\n\n38\n00:01:45.288 --> 00:01:48.740\nBut a portfolio,\nwell let's look at what it is first, and\n\n39\n00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.950\nthen let's look at change\nmanagement at that portfolio level.\n\n40\n00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.426\nWhat we're going to do over the next\nfew episodes is we're actually gonna\n\n41\n00:01:56.426 --> 00:01:58.557\nlook at change management\nat the portfolio,\n\n42\n00:01:58.557 --> 00:02:01.602\nwe're going to look at change\nmanagement at the program level.\n\n43\n00:02:01.602 --> 00:02:05.644\nAnd we're going to look at change\nmanagement at the actual project level\n\n44\n00:02:05.644 --> 00:02:06.950\nitself.\n\n45\n00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.047\nI've already mentioned that\na change is something that we do,\n\n46\n00:02:12.047 --> 00:02:16.960\nsomething that we implement to improve,\nmake life better.\n\n47\n00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.801\nAnd so everything that we do is to,\nwell, improve and make life better.\n\n48\n00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:23.090\nI should hope so, anyway.\n\n49\n00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.849\nSo, let's take a look then at\nthe difference between a portfolio and\n\n50\n00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.799\na program and a project,\nto start off with.\n\n51\n00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.760\nBecause I quite often hear\nthese particular phrases,\n\n52\n00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.000\nthose particular terms,\nused interchangeably, and they're not.\n\n53\n00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.688\nBecause a portfolio is actually\na collection of programs or\n\n54\n00:02:43.688 --> 00:02:49.609\nprojects all linked together to\nachieve specific strategic objectives.\n\n55\n00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.441\nIn other words, it's your portfolio.\n\n56\n00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:55.533\nYou might want to think that it is\na database where you keep all of\n\n57\n00:02:55.533 --> 00:02:57.785\nyour programs and your projects.\n\n58\n00:02:57.785 --> 00:03:01.043\nLet me take a look at this\nparticular slide in front of you.\n\n59\n00:03:01.043 --> 00:03:03.550\nAnd this is gonna explain\njust a little bit better.\n\n60\n00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:12.162\nYour portfolio should contain all\nof your projects and your programs.\n\n61\n00:03:12.162 --> 00:03:15.720\nAnd all of the specific objectives of\nthose projects and those programs.\n\n62\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.283\nNow a program is a collection\nof linked projects.\n\n63\n00:03:22.283 --> 00:03:25.466\nWhen I say collection it\ncould be just two or three,\n\n64\n00:03:25.466 --> 00:03:29.690\nit doesn't necessarily have to be 15,\nthat's a program.\n\n65\n00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.606\nWhereas a portfolio, well, the programs\nand projects within the portfolio,\n\n66\n00:03:33.606 --> 00:03:35.719\nwhether they're independent projects.\n\n67\n00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:38.619\nIn which case then,\nwe don't need that program layer, or\n\n68\n00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:41.581\nwhether they are programs with\nprojects underneath them,\n\n69\n00:03:41.581 --> 00:03:44.840\nthey don't have to be linked\nwithin the portfolio.\n\n70\n00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.709\nLike I said think of\nthis as your database.\n\n71\n00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.173\nThis is your database of\nall of your projects.\n\n72\n00:03:50.173 --> 00:03:53.670\nAnd all of basically your\nrequest that you have.\n\n73\n00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.489\nNow all of these have to, well,\nthey're responsible for and\n\n74\n00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.152\nthey have to manage change into\nthe business as usual live environment.\n\n75\n00:04:04.152 --> 00:04:09.311\nSo here at portfolio level, what sort of\nchanges do you think we're considering?\n\n76\n00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:11.261\nRight at the that top level,\nwe have there,\n\n77\n00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:15.554\nwhat changes are we considering?\n&gt;&gt; We're considering whether to add or\n\n78\n00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:17.220\nremove something.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n79\n00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.632\n&gt;&gt; In either a project or\n\n80\n00:04:18.632 --> 00:04:22.330\na bigger program.\n&gt;&gt; So here we are at strategy level.\n\n81\n00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.062\nWe're very much at the strategic level.\n\n82\n00:04:24.062 --> 00:04:27.304\nSo, what we're considering here\nis as exactly as you said,\n\n83\n00:04:27.304 --> 00:04:29.830\nwhether we want to bring new projects in.\n\n84\n00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.943\nWhether we want to remove\nany existing projects.\n\n85\n00:04:33.943 --> 00:04:36.250\nMaybe those projects have been replaced.\n\n86\n00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.920\nMaybe they've been superceded.\n\n87\n00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.293\nBut you know what's it like.\n\n88\n00:04:39.293 --> 00:04:44.010\nWe're here in IT, let's be honest,\nand in IT, things move fairly quickly.\n\n89\n00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.183\nSometimes though,\n\n90\n00:04:45.183 --> 00:04:49.815\nproject management doesn't necessarily\nmove as quickly as technology does.\n\n91\n00:04:49.815 --> 00:04:53.599\nAnd we might launch a project, or\nwe might sort of have an idea for\n\n92\n00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:57.980\na project to say, upgrade our\noperating system to the next version.\n\n93\n00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.556\nBut it's not a priority\nwithin the organization.\n\n94\n00:05:00.556 --> 00:05:06.720\nSo it sits there as a project with a low\npriority in this portfolio that you see.\n\n95\n00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.244\nBut then, the vendor, the supplier\nreleases a new version of the operating\n\n96\n00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:14.299\nsystem before we even get\nstarted on that project.\n\n97\n00:05:14.299 --> 00:05:19.277\nAnd so, it's here at this particular\nlevel, at this portfolio level that we\n\n98\n00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:24.575\nmake the decision as to what projects\nwe need to bring into the organization.\n\n99\n00:05:24.575 --> 00:05:28.704\nWhat projects we are gonna remove,\nif we do remove any and\n\n100\n00:05:28.704 --> 00:05:32.500\nalso the prioritization of\nthose projects as well.\n\n101\n00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.661\nThese projects that we have in our\nportfolio are not necessarily,\n\n102\n00:05:35.661 --> 00:05:39.217\nas you can see in front of you,\nthey're not necessarily interdependent or\n\n103\n00:05:39.217 --> 00:05:41.020\neven related at all.\n\n104\n00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:47.672\nSo, it can be very difficult then to\nprioritize all of these projects.\n\n105\n00:05:47.672 --> 00:05:51.683\nBecause you may have a project for\na particular business user,\n\n106\n00:05:51.683 --> 00:05:55.770\nyou may have a subportfolio with\nprograms in a linked project for\n\n107\n00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.830\nanother particular business unit.\n\n108\n00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.666\nYou may have a project that the marketing\nteam have requested because they\n\n109\n00:06:03.666 --> 00:06:07.176\nwant to get us out to market\nsooner than anybody else.\n\n110\n00:06:07.176 --> 00:06:10.950\nSo, prioritization can\nbe very very difficult.\n\n111\n00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.928\nWe've also then got to think\nabout resourcing as well.\n\n112\n00:06:14.928 --> 00:06:18.950\nBecause you see what portfolio\nmanagement is responsible for\n\n113\n00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.050\nis ensuring whatever project we have.\n\n114\n00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.403\nWell, let's just say there's absolutely\nno point in having 500 projects in our\n\n115\n00:06:26.403 --> 00:06:30.574\nportfolio when we've only got 20 people\nthat are capable of actually managing\n\n116\n00:06:30.574 --> 00:06:31.333\nthe project.\n\n117\n00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:34.620\nAnd developing whatever it\nis that we want to deploy.\n\n118\n00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.504\nSo, portfolio management is\nmaking those decisions, too.\n\n119\n00:06:39.504 --> 00:06:42.388\nSo, this is our project portfolio.\n\n120\n00:06:42.388 --> 00:06:46.267\nNow, I do have a word of warning to you.\n\n121\n00:06:46.267 --> 00:06:50.475\nBecause I have been into organizations,\nvery recently in fact,\n\n122\n00:06:50.475 --> 00:06:55.291\nwhere the project portfolio which you\nsee right in front of you was confused\n\n123\n00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:57.220\nwith the service portfolio.\n\n124\n00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.384\nNow, Do you know the difference between\n\n125\n00:07:03.384 --> 00:07:04.914\nthem?\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n126\n00:07:04.914 --> 00:07:07.826\nI do not know the difference\nbetween the service portfolio and\n\n127\n00:07:07.826 --> 00:07:10.081\nthe project portfolio.\n&gt;&gt; Right,okay, so\n\n128\n00:07:10.081 --> 00:07:14.120\na service portfolio is a term that\nwe use in service management.\n\n129\n00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.533\nAnd your service portfolio\nis a database of all\n\n130\n00:07:18.533 --> 00:07:22.841\nof those ideas that we have for\nnew services.\n\n131\n00:07:22.841 --> 00:07:26.810\nIt also includes your catalog, which\nis a list of all of the live services.\n\n132\n00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.340\nAnd it also includes all of\nthe retired services as well\n\n133\n00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.189\nwithin an IT service\nprovider organization.\n\n134\n00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:41.922\nYour project portfolio is a list of the\nprojects that we are looking to work on.\n\n135\n00:07:41.922 --> 00:07:46.091\nI'm not gonna say working on,\nbecause some of them we're not working on.\n\n136\n00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:49.522\nSo some of them we're just considering\nwhether we're working on them,\n\n137\n00:07:49.522 --> 00:07:51.840\nwe're just prioritizing right now.\n\n138\n00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.051\nSo essentially, the idea has.\n\n139\n00:07:55.051 --> 00:07:59.171\nWell it's come up, business relationship\nmanagement for instance have brought\n\n140\n00:07:59.171 --> 00:08:03.360\nthe idea to the steering group, and\nthe steering group make the decision.\n\n141\n00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:09.380\nAnd it's at that point in time when that\npotential project appears in the project\n\n142\n00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:15.860\nportfolio, but it appears in the service\nportfolio sooner when it's still an idea.\n\n143\n00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.437\nSo the project portfolio,\n\n144\n00:08:20.437 --> 00:08:26.250\nwell I guess you could say it's not a\nsubset of your service portfolio, but it's\n\n145\n00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:32.010\nsomething that is ticked off once we have\ncome up with an idea for a new service.\n\n146\n00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.360\nThen we kick off our project portfolio and\n\n147\n00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.530\nthat's where we manage\nall of our projects.\n\n148\n00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.560\nAnd that's where the project team,\n\n149\n00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.540\na development team will actually\nmanage those projects through\n\n150\n00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.500\nto the implementation of any new\nservice or any new functionality.\n\n151\n00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.480\nAnd even the removal of any\nexisting functionality as well.\n\n152\n00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.830\nSo your portfolio within your projects,\n\n153\n00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:00.200\nyour project portfolio that\nwe're looking at now consists of\n\n154\n00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:05.810\nprograms that are related projects,\nand individual projects as well.\n\n155\n00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.910\nAnd what we're concerned about here is\n\n156\n00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:14.910\nthe decision as to whether a project\nshould go ahead or not, and\n\n157\n00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:20.000\nalso when particular projects should go\nahead, in other words, the prioritization.\n\n158\n00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.100\nSo we're taking into consideration\nthings like cost, and time, and\n\n159\n00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.160\nof course, as I've already mentioned,\nthe amount of resources that we have too.\n\n160\n00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.640\nSo I want to use this\nparticular diagram here.\n\n161\n00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.680\nAnd because I quite like this one,\nit's really simple.\n\n162\n00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.750\nWell, I like to think it's pretty simple,\nbecause I like things that are simple.\n\n163\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.130\nPortfolio management.\n\n164\n00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.570\nYou'll see that they make sure that\nthe right projects are done and\n\n165\n00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:51.380\nthat we've got the right number of\nprojects to fit in with the capacity that\n\n166\n00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:55.100\nwe have, and that they're prioritized,\nthey're done in the right order.\n\n167\n00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.476\nWhereas, project management makes\nsure that the projects are done\n\n168\n00:09:58.476 --> 00:10:00.850\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n169\n00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.260\n&gt;&gt; I quite like that description,\n\n170\n00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.250\nI'll be perfectly honest with you.\n\n171\n00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.600\nPortfolio management makes sure that\nthe right projects are done, and\n\n172\n00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.180\nproject management makes sure that\nthe projects are done in the right\n\n173\n00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.130\nway.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n174\n00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.300\n&gt;&gt; So that's the difference between them.\n\n175\n00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:19.190\nBut our next diagram, well our next\ndiagram, it looks kind of messy,\n\n176\n00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.000\nI know that.\n\n177\n00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.840\nThis is available in your downloadable\nmaterials, so don't be put off by this.\n\n178\n00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.290\nAnd we are going to break this down.\n\n179\n00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:33.480\nWe are going to look at\nthe steps of managing a change.\n\n180\n00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.140\nAnd that's a change in your portfolio,\na change to the portfolio,\n\n181\n00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.230\nas well as a change to\neach individual project.\n\n182\n00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.030\nSo, we're going to look at that\nall over the next three episodes.\n\n183\n00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.040\nWe're going to be coming\nback to this diagram,\n\n184\n00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:52.430\nand we're gonna be relating this\ndiagram to each individual layer.\n\n185\n00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:57.050\nSo here we are at the portfolio layer,\nand we're making decisions as to whether\n\n186\n00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.820\na change or whether a new\nservice should be implemented.\n\n187\n00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.480\nShould it be one we consider?\n\n188\n00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:08.060\nSo the first thing we do is we want to,\nas it says there, formulate the change.\n\n189\n00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.570\nWe're coming up with a new idea.\n\n190\n00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.400\nThis means that we have to consider\nthe justification for the change.\n\n191\n00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:22.000\nWe have to consider why we want\nthis particular project, and\n\n192\n00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.790\nwhat the urgency is for\nthat particular project, and\n\n193\n00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.420\nwho's going to be impacted\nby that particular project.\n\n194\n00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.320\nAnd when it's required, well I said\nurgency, but what about priority as well?\n\n195\n00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.090\nWe also want to consider, and\nI'm gonna look at this next diagram.\n\n196\n00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.580\nCuz this next diagram talks\nabout change readiness.\n\n197\n00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.240\nThis is all part of formulating a change.\n\n198\n00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:50.550\nIt's all part of coming up with the idea\nfor a new service and a new project.\n\n199\n00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.859\nThere is absolutely no\npoint in this earth, and\n\n200\n00:11:53.859 --> 00:11:56.347\nI've seen it so many times before.\n\n201\n00:11:56.347 --> 00:11:58.511\nAnd I want you to think\nabout common sense.\n\n202\n00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:03.178\nThere is absolutely no point on this\nearth of coming up with an idea for\n\n203\n00:12:03.178 --> 00:12:08.490\na new service and giving it a priority\none in our portfolio, that's something\n\n204\n00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:13.500\nthat we've got to do right now when\nthe organization's not ready for it.\n\n205\n00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.630\nAbsolutely not,\nthis is how technology fails by the way.\n\n206\n00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:24.860\nWhen we release new technology at\na point in time that the organization or\n\n207\n00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.580\neven the world is not ready for it.\n\n208\n00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.290\nA few years ago now, and I don't\nknow whether you remember this, but\n\n209\n00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:36.350\na few years ago now,\nSony brought out an e-reader.\n\n210\n00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.597\nRemember that?\n&gt;&gt; I do remember that, the white,\n\n211\n00:12:39.597 --> 00:12:40.680\nI remember that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n212\n00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.400\nI can't remember exactly\nwhat it was called.\n\n213\n00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:49.310\nBut I know it was, at the time,\nlabeled as quite sort of visionary.\n\n214\n00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.540\nIt was about paperless books.\n\n215\n00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.060\nAnd it was gonna be the next big thing.\n\n216\n00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:59.620\nIt was marketed right, and\nit was marketed at a time that\n\n217\n00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:04.810\nthe marketplace, in other words,\nyou and me were ready for it.\n\n218\n00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.980\nIt was fairly successful.\n\n219\n00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.580\nI mean, there,\nwe've got things like Kindle and\n\n220\n00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:13.640\nother technologies that have\nbeen spawned from that.\n\n221\n00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.900\nBut did you know that back in 1999, and\n\n222\n00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:22.910\nI say this because I was on-site with this\norganization with that point and time.\n\n223\n00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:26.940\nBack in 1999, did you know that Xerox\ncame out with a digital e-reader for\n\n224\n00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.050\na book?\n&gt;&gt; I did not.\n\n225\n00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.220\n&gt;&gt; Which was about seven years before\n\n226\n00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:30.820\nSony did.\n\n227\n00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.590\nAnd one of the reasons why\nyou haven't heard of that\n\n228\n00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.530\nis because the market wasn't quite ready.\n\n229\n00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.200\nAnd so when we launch, and\nit wasn't because it was unsuccessful,\n\n230\n00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.230\nit actually did everything\nthat the Sony version did.\n\n231\n00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.910\nAnd it was available a lot sooner.\n\n232\n00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.650\nHowever, the market wasn't ready for it.\n\n233\n00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:59.320\nSo this is one of those instances where\nwe can say, if you're not ready for\n\n234\n00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.830\nthe technology,\nif your users are not ready for this,\n\n235\n00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:08.870\nthen why is it priority\none in your portfolio?\n\n236\n00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.455\nSo that's part of this, and you'll see\nwhat we've done is on the left hands,\n\n237\n00:14:13.455 --> 00:14:15.870\nI've just broken down that lifecycle.\n\n238\n00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:19.250\nAnd that's part of that\nformulating that change.\n\n239\n00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:23.400\nSo that's that in the top left\nhand corner there as you can see.\n\n240\n00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.200\nOnce we formulated the change,\nand we have done things like,\n\n241\n00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:32.110\nwe've assessed readiness, and\nthen we have also looked at,\n\n242\n00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:35.940\nhow it's going to impact the organization.\n\n243\n00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.920\nAnd here you'll see,\nthat what we want to achieve\n\n244\n00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:45.150\nis well,\nwe gotta work out what we want to achieve.\n\n245\n00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.250\nI was just gonna say what\nwould be the most ideal?\n\n246\n00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.460\nThe most ideal would be somewhere in the\nmiddle, because what we actually want to\n\n247\n00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:55.820\nachieve is organizational change,\nwe want to have a change, we\n\n248\n00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.920\ndon't want it just be part of business as\nusual otherwise where is the improvement?\n\n249\n00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.070\nHowever it's got to be\nsomething that the company and\n\n250\n00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.470\nthe organization is gonna\nbe comfortable as well.\n\n251\n00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:11.650\nAnd sometimes with enhanced capabilities\nthey're not necessarily comfortable with\n\n252\n00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:16.340\nthose enhanced capabilities, think about\nwhat I just said, about the e-reader.\n\n253\n00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.720\nThe marketplace wasn't ready for\nthose enhanced capabilities.\n\n254\n00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.580\nAnd so because they weren't ready\n\n255\n00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:28.710\nthen it wasn't as successful\nas say the Sony version.\n\n256\n00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:32.470\nSo we have to do what we\ncall an impact assessment\n\n257\n00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.310\nwhich is part of formulating that change.\n\n258\n00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.250\nAnd that simply means that we take a look\n\n259\n00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:43.620\nat the actual level of change\nitself in any particular project.\n\n260\n00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.890\nAnd then we look at whether\nthe organization is ready and\n\n261\n00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.440\nthat gives us that impact assessment.\n\n262\n00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.593\nSo it's very much how big is the change,\nhow ready are we for\n\n263\n00:15:54.593 --> 00:15:58.524\nit And\nwe've got to bridge that gap somehow.\n\n264\n00:15:58.524 --> 00:16:01.410\nAnd that gap is what we\ncall the gap analysis.\n\n265\n00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.420\nThat's why we do this gap analysis.\n\n266\n00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:08.970\nAnd that's part of, then,\nthe formulating the change.\n\n267\n00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:14.480\nThat's the deciding on whether\nthat project is a good idea or\n\n268\n00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.750\nwhether it's not a good idea, and\n\n269\n00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:22.770\nthat's also a part of deciding on\nthe prioritization of the project.\n\n270\n00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:25.770\nAnd all of that happens in\nthat top left hand corner\n\n271\n00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:29.880\nwhere it says formulate change,\nthat's what we're doing.\n\n272\n00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.930\nWe're assessing whether its a viable fit.\n\n273\n00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.930\nWe're assessing basically\nwhether its a good idea.\n\n274\n00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.560\nWe're assessing how urgent it is.\n\n275\n00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.560\nWe're also accessing how, well,\n\n276\n00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.710\nI said urgent but how important it\nis to the organization as well.\n\n277\n00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.570\nBecause something might be\nincredible important, but\n\n278\n00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.860\nit might not be necessarily be urgent.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n279\n00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.750\n&gt;&gt; We also have to assess the impact to\n\n280\n00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.520\nthe organization.\n\n281\n00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.860\nWe want impact, don't get me wrong.\n\n282\n00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.130\nWe use the word impact\nin quite a negative way.\n\n283\n00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:03.030\nWe think of impact very negatively.\n\n284\n00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:06.860\nBut actually I want impact,\nbut I want positive impact.\n\n285\n00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.820\nAnd the yardstick for\nany change is that the positive impact has\n\n286\n00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:13.700\ngot to outweigh the negative\nimpact caused by the change.\n\n287\n00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.260\nAnd it doesn't matter how\nsmall that change is,\n\n288\n00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.060\nyou do not want the negative\nimpact to outweigh the positive.\n\n289\n00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:26.010\nThe positive has to outweigh the negative.\n\n290\n00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:31.572\nI mentioned in a previous episode that we\nlook at why we want to implement a change.\n\n291\n00:17:31.572 --> 00:17:34.325\nAnd this is exactly the same here,\n\n292\n00:17:34.325 --> 00:17:39.225\neven at portfolio level we're looking\nat why we want a particular change.\n\n293\n00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:42.040\nWhat is the reasoning for it?\n\n294\n00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.460\nThere are things like regulations.\n\n295\n00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.490\nWe know that every organization,\nevery industry has them.\n\n296\n00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:50.520\nAnd so sometimes the why is just\nbecause we don't want the fine, or\n\n297\n00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.355\njust because we want to put\na tick in a box, and that's fine.\n\n298\n00:17:53.355 --> 00:17:56.330\n[LAUGH] There's nothing wrong with that.\n\n299\n00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.930\nWe do need to comply\nwith certain regulations.\n\n300\n00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:03.150\nBut at the same time,\nyou have to understand why.\n\n301\n00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:08.390\nAnd you have to be able to articulate\nthe positive impact as well as prepare for\n\n302\n00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.170\nthe negative impact.\n\n303\n00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.650\nThat's why we do that impact assessment.\n\n304\n00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:16.750\nAnd let's try not to think of it as just\nnegative cuz it's so easy to do that.\n\n305\n00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:23.160\nAnd it's at that point in time,\nthen, that we decide on which\n\n306\n00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.980\nproject we're going to go ahead with.\n\n307\n00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:30.230\nWhich projects are going\nto be maybe put on hold for\n\n308\n00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:34.040\na little while, and we decide on\nthe prioritization of the project.\n\n309\n00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:38.300\nAnd as I said, we've gotta decide about\nprioritization based on skill levels.\n\n310\n00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:43.000\nNow some organizations will resource,\nwill bring in capacity for\n\n311\n00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.430\neach individual project.\n\n312\n00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:49.420\nAnd they will bring in specialist\ndevelopers and specialist project\n\n313\n00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:55.220\nmanagers for a limited period of time, for\nthe duration of each individual project.\n\n314\n00:18:55.220 --> 00:19:01.040\nAnd then those specialist project\nmanagers will then move on.\n\n315\n00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.960\nSome organizations do that.\n\n316\n00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:08.460\nSome organizations prefer to use\ntheir own in-house capabilities.\n\n317\n00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.250\nOf course, that's a much more\nexpensive way of doing this.\n\n318\n00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.470\nYou automatically think that\nbringing in specialist staff\n\n319\n00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.730\nis an expensive way of doing things.\n\n320\n00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:22.280\nBut actually, if you weigh that up\nagainst the cost of training up\n\n321\n00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:28.410\nyour existing staff to a level where\nthey can then implement that project.\n\n322\n00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:32.168\nAnd the fact that they've already got\nworkload assigned to them anyway.\n\n323\n00:19:32.168 --> 00:19:34.740\nAnd then it could be having\na detrimental impact,\n\n324\n00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.050\nthat negative impact on your timelines,\nfor instance.\n\n325\n00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:43.460\nSo it's part of that strategic\nlevel that you have to weigh it up.\n\n326\n00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.910\nYou have to prioritize based on your\nbudget, based on your timeline,\n\n327\n00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:52.890\nbased on the skills that you have, and\nbased on the urgency to the organization.\n\n328\n00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:59.980\nNow the next sections that we have here,\nthe plan the change, and the implementing\n\n329\n00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:04.070\nthe change, and managing the transition,\nwe're not actually gonna cover.\n\n330\n00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.353\nWhy not?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n331\n00:20:07.353 --> 00:20:12.297\n[LAUGH] I really don't know.\n&gt;&gt; See, I like to trip him up every now\n\n332\n00:20:12.297 --> 00:20:13.951\nand again because I'm mean.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n333\n00:20:13.951 --> 00:20:16.974\nyou do.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, because we handle that at\n\n334\n00:20:16.974 --> 00:20:20.213\nindividual project level.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, makes sense,\n\n335\n00:20:20.213 --> 00:20:24.144\nplan change implement.\n&gt;&gt; We are talking about\n\n336\n00:20:24.144 --> 00:20:25.142\nthe decision making.\n\n337\n00:20:25.142 --> 00:20:29.127\nWe're talking about the strategic\nlevel here at portfolio.\n\n338\n00:20:29.127 --> 00:20:33.957\nAnd so actually planning the change and\nthen implementing it and managing that\n\n339\n00:20:33.957 --> 00:20:39.987\ntransition, that's something that we\ndo at the individual project level.\n\n340\n00:20:39.987 --> 00:20:42.968\nWe don't even do that necessarily\nat the program level.\n\n341\n00:20:42.968 --> 00:20:45.108\nWe plan changes at the program level, but\n\n342\n00:20:45.108 --> 00:20:48.118\nwe certainly don't implement\nthem at the program level.\n\n343\n00:20:48.118 --> 00:20:52.658\nSo what we're concerned with right now,\nthen, is at portfolio level,\n\n344\n00:20:52.658 --> 00:20:54.448\nwe're concerned with this.\n\n345\n00:20:54.448 --> 00:20:58.428\nWe're concerned with ensuring\nthat whatever it is we\n\n346\n00:20:58.428 --> 00:21:03.720\nimplement into the live\nenvironment is accepted.\n\n347\n00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.690\nWe use the term embedded in IT,\nand I quite like that, but\n\n348\n00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.870\nI also like the term accepted and\nfollowed as well, yeah.\n\n349\n00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.986\nYou want to make it difficult to go back,\nbut\n\n350\n00:21:14.986 --> 00:21:18.010\nwe've already talked about\nthis in previous episodes.\n\n351\n00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:21.250\nThis is not just about removing\nthe old way of doing things.\n\n352\n00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:24.900\nThis is actually about, well,\ncreating that sense of urgency,\n\n353\n00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:29.040\ncreating a need so\nother people don't want to go back.\n\n354\n00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.070\nNow I know that this is a common theme\n[LAUGH] throughout this particular series.\n\n355\n00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:38.162\nBut we want to give Ronnie a TV that is so\ngreat and so spectacular that he never,\n\n356\n00:21:38.162 --> 00:21:43.272\never wants to turn on that wooden console\nbox that's in the corner of the room.\n\n357\n00:21:43.272 --> 00:21:44.932\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n358\n00:21:44.932 --> 00:21:46.467\n&gt;&gt; It's never gonna happen, I know,\n\n359\n00:21:46.467 --> 00:21:47.730\nI know him.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n360\n00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:50.290\n&gt;&gt; But I'm trying here, I am trying.\n\n361\n00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.995\nBenefits realizations starts\nas soon as the assessment,\n\n362\n00:21:55.995 --> 00:21:59.974\nthat readiness, is agreed and\nthe scope is defined.\n\n363\n00:22:01.553 --> 00:22:02.528\nDo you know why?\n\n364\n00:22:02.528 --> 00:22:06.770\nThat's quite an interesting point,\nand I really like that point.\n\n365\n00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:10.880\nAnd it's something that we forget,\ndo have any idea why?\n\n366\n00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.813\nIt's something that's\nquite often overlooked\n\n367\n00:22:13.813 --> 00:22:14.429\n&gt;&gt; No I don't,\n\n368\n00:22:14.429 --> 00:22:15.773\nas I start to think about it,\n\n369\n00:22:15.773 --> 00:22:19.200\nI'm not sure why.\n&gt;&gt; I wanna make sure that you're\n\n370\n00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:19.840\nready for this.\n\n371\n00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.726\nThere is absolutely, it goes back to\nwhat I was saying previously about\n\n372\n00:22:23.726 --> 00:22:25.942\nthese e-book readers, for instance.\n\n373\n00:22:25.942 --> 00:22:28.730\nI wanna make sure that\nthe marketplace is ready.\n\n374\n00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:35.130\nSo I'm gonna start embedding the change\nwhilst I'm still formulating the change.\n\n375\n00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.690\nBecause, you see,\nif I don't think that you're ready for\n\n376\n00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:44.280\na new TV, if I don't start preparing\nyou for a new TV, then there's\n\n377\n00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.750\nabsolutely no way on this earth that\nyou're gonna use it if I give it to you.\n\n378\n00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.640\nSo my change is gonna be unsuccessful.\n\n379\n00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.984\nIt's not going to work.\n\n380\n00:22:53.984 --> 00:22:56.301\nYou're gonna go back to your old ways of\n\n381\n00:22:56.301 --> 00:22:59.900\nworking.\n&gt;&gt; Agreed.\n\n382\n00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.180\n&gt;&gt; And so what we've gotta do\n\n383\n00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.260\nis we've got to prepare.\n\n384\n00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.050\nRemember what we said in\nprevious episodes about,\n\n385\n00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:09.590\nin organizational change, we've got to\nensure that we create a sense of urgency.\n\n386\n00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:12.530\nThat we've got to create a need.\n\n387\n00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:18.492\nAnd therefore, benefits realization\nhas got to start from the moment that\n\n388\n00:23:18.492 --> 00:23:25.130\nwe formulate the plan for any particular\nchange, and for any particular project.\n\n389\n00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:28.510\nI've gotta make sure that I\ncan articulate the benefits.\n\n390\n00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.505\nRemember the positives gotta\noutweigh the negative?\n\n391\n00:23:31.505 --> 00:23:34.660\nI've gotta articulate to you from day one.\n\n392\n00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.710\nYou're not going to start and\n\n393\n00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:43.160\nuse this new TV if I cannot articulate\nto you what the benefits will be.\n\n394\n00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:48.057\nAnd I have got to ask you, from day one,\nwhether you see this being\n\n395\n00:23:48.057 --> 00:23:52.262\nof a benefit to you,\nwhether you would actually use it.\n\n396\n00:23:52.262 --> 00:23:57.126\nCuz if you wouldn't use something, then\nwhy am I spending potentially millions of\n\n397\n00:23:57.126 --> 00:24:01.290\ndollars or pounds Creating something\nthat you are not going to use.\n\n398\n00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:02.528\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n399\n00:24:02.528 --> 00:24:05.713\n&gt;&gt; So benefits realization is not just\n\n400\n00:24:05.713 --> 00:24:06.660\na case.\n\n401\n00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:10.380\nAnd this is where many projects fail,\nbecause they fail to.\n\n402\n00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.660\nWell, the projects themselves\ndon't necessarily fail, but\n\n403\n00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:18.070\nwe fail to articulate that ROI,\nthat return on investment.\n\n404\n00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.450\nOr even the VOI, the value on investment,\n\n405\n00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:25.010\nbecause we don't really understand\nwhat the true value is.\n\n406\n00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:26.830\nSo we have to work out,\n\n407\n00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:31.220\nright from the very beginning,\nwhat the benefit should look like.\n\n408\n00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:35.110\nAnd then once the project has been\nimplemented, then I come back to you and\n\n409\n00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:40.220\nI say, okay then, did you get\nthe benefits that I promised you would?\n\n410\n00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.220\nAnd what I'm hoping for at that point\nis that you're gonna say to me,\n\n411\n00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:49.320\nactually yes, Jo I got them,\nand I got so much more.\n\n412\n00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:53.150\nIn other words,\nhere I've got you a new TV and\n\n413\n00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:58.400\nI'm going to plan this new TV,\nI'm going to build it with you in mind.\n\n414\n00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.060\nAnd I'm going to sell you on the benefits\nof that new TV, and then I'm gonna\n\n415\n00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:06.030\ncome back to you and I'm gonna say, did\nyou get everything that I promised you?\n\n416\n00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.850\nDid you get everything that you asked for?\n\n417\n00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.128\nDo you perceive it to be value for money?\n\n418\n00:25:11.128 --> 00:25:14.950\nAnd you're gonna say to me,\nI got everything that I asked for and so\n\n419\n00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:15.480\nmuch more.\n\n420\n00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.010\nAnd that's what I want from you.\n\n421\n00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.760\nThat's exactly what I want from you.\n\n422\n00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:29.402\nSo this is what we have to do then\nat this strategic portfolio level.\n\n423\n00:25:29.402 --> 00:25:31.880\nI mean, portfolio change management,\n\n424\n00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:37.150\nwhat we're doing is well,\nwe are making strategic decisions.\n\n425\n00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:39.720\nWe are the, well, the main,\n\n426\n00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:44.740\nit says that the primary conduit between\nmanagers of the portfolio components.\n\n427\n00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:49.747\nBut we are the people that will\ncoordinate all of the projects and\n\n428\n00:25:49.747 --> 00:25:54.105\nall of the programs,\nto ensure that we are prioritizing\n\n429\n00:25:54.105 --> 00:25:58.113\nthe projects in a way that is best for\nthe business.\n\n430\n00:25:58.113 --> 00:26:00.816\nAnd of course we're also\nthe people that are, well,\n\n431\n00:26:00.816 --> 00:26:04.130\nassigning all the responsibility for\nall of those projects too.\n\n432\n00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:10.528\nSo in this particular episode what we have\nlooked at is we've looked at strategic\n\n433\n00:26:10.528 --> 00:26:11.960\ndecision making.\n\n434\n00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:17.380\nWe've looked at managing the decision as\nto whether to go ahead with the change.\n\n435\n00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.890\nAnd in our next episode,\nthen we're going to look at this\n\n436\n00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:24.834\nfrom the program management perspective.\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well, thank you for\n\n437\n00:26:24.834 --> 00:26:27.212\nhelping us to focus in on\nthis idea of strategy.\n\n438\n00:26:27.212 --> 00:26:29.608\nIt's missed most of the,\nI won't say most of the time.\n\n439\n00:26:29.608 --> 00:26:33.967\nIt's missed often when we start to\nactually take a look at the very fact that\n\n440\n00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:37.000\nwe focus in on projects and\nnot the strategy.\n\n441\n00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.950\nAnd we'd only do that, we start\nonly seeing incremental changes and\n\n442\n00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.740\nnot the full benefit of all the changes\nthat Jo has been talking about.\n\n443\n00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:49.183\nSo we wanna make sure that we understand\nthat in organizational change management,\n\n444\n00:26:49.183 --> 00:26:50.750\nit is a change of everything.\n\n445\n00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.830\nIt has to begin at the strategic\nlevel if we are going to do this.\n\n446\n00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:56.021\nSo in this episode we did see quite a bit,\nbut\n\n447\n00:26:56.021 --> 00:26:58.803\nthere is more to come as Jo\nhas been teasing us about now,\n\n448\n00:26:58.803 --> 00:27:03.086\nthat just didn't last minute or two, so\nwe're gonna save that for another episode.\n\n449\n00:27:03.086 --> 00:27:06.970\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n450\n00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:07.970\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n451\n00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:09.976\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\n\n452\n00:27:09.976 --> 00:27:13.993\nmore organizational change\nmanagement

00:00:08.214\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:13.075\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another\n\n5\n00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:15.010\ngreat episode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.890\nYou're watching\nthe Organizational Change Management Show.\n\n7\n00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.200\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n8\n00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.210\ntoday, we're gonna be focusing\non program change management.\n\n9\n00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.570\nAnd who better to help us out,\n\n10\n00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.175\nof course, than the change management\npremiere herself, it's Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:31.980\nJo, welcome to the show,\nhow are you doing?\n\n12\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.920\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me.\n\n13\n00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.250\nRonnie, how are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing well, Jo,\n\n14\n00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.730\nas we continue on in taking a look at the\nidea of organizational change management.\n\n15\n00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.350\nWe've previously discussed a little\nbit about strategic change management\n\n16\n00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.140\nof course.\n\n17\n00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.200\nAnd then, portfolio change management,\nI should say.\n\n18\n00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.920\nAnd then, now we're taking a look\nat program change management.\n\n19\n00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.302\nSo where is this leading us?\n&gt;&gt; Well, before we go any further,\n\n20\n00:00:55.302 --> 00:00:57.949\nwhat I want to do is just\nrefresh everybody's mind.\n\n21\n00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:58.760\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n22\n00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.568\n&gt;&gt; Just on what the difference between\n\n23\n00:01:01.568 --> 00:01:07.931\na portfolio and a project, and a program\nis because that's obviously, well and\n\n24\n00:01:07.931 --> 00:01:14.220\nI know I said in previous episodes that,\na portfolio, program, project.\n\n25\n00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.035\nThese are terms that\nare used interchangeably.\n\n26\n00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:19.855\nAnd these are obviously confusing terms,\nI think.\n\n27\n00:01:19.855 --> 00:01:22.565\nAnd so I just wanna refresh your memories.\n\n28\n00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:26.990\nAnd just bring up this quick little\ngraphic on the screen in front of you now,\n\n29\n00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.785\njust to show you the difference between\na portfolio and the program and a project.\n\n30\n00:01:31.785 --> 00:01:36.760\nA portfolio, well I've already\nsaid this is your data source for\n\n31\n00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.842\nall of your projects and your programs.\n\n32\n00:01:41.062 --> 00:01:47.290\nA program is a set of connected projects,\nso they are related in some way.\n\n33\n00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.500\nThey may well be to do with\nthe same service, they may well\n\n34\n00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.860\nbe to do with the same hardware, or they\nmay well be for the same business unit.\n\n35\n00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.200\nSo a program is a set of projects\nthat are related in some way.\n\n36\n00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.070\nSometimes though projects\nare just a one of project for\n\n37\n00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.690\na particular business unit or\nfor a particular service or\n\n38\n00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.610\na particular piece of hardware,\nfor instance.\n\n39\n00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.030\nIn which case then, that would just be and\n\n40\n00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.370\nindividual project as we got in\nthe middle there in the green.\n\n41\n00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.300\nIn portfolio management just manages\nall of those to make sure that we have\n\n42\n00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.020\nThe right number of projects and\n\n43\n00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.010\nthat we have the right\nprioritization on those projects.\n\n44\n00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.830\nAnd project management,\nwell, projects are managed\n\n45\n00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.890\nindividually to be released as\nchanges into the live environment.\n\n46\n00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.250\nSo that's just a real quick recap on\nthe difference between a project and\n\n47\n00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.150\na program and a portfolio.\n\n48\n00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.370\nAnd so here we are in our last series,\nour last episode,\n\n49\n00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.880\nwe looked at portfolio management.\n\n50\n00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.267\nI'm just trying get my right slide up\n\n51\n00:02:58.267 --> 00:02:58.920\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n52\n00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.820\n&gt;&gt; In the last show,\n\n53\n00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.240\nwe looked at portfolio management,\nand what we're interested in portfolio\n\n54\n00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.240\nmanagement is actually managing\nthe formulation of the change.\n\n55\n00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.310\nIt's managing the idea for\na particular project.\n\n56\n00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.820\nWhat it is, well prioritizing that idea,\n\n57\n00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.030\nmanaging that idea and\nalso well agreeing on that idea as well.\n\n58\n00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.600\nSo deciding whether we're going to\nimplement a specific project or not and\n\n59\n00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.060\nprioritizing that and\nensuring we've got the right time and\n\n60\n00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.180\nthe right money and the right resources\nto be able to deliver a project.\n\n61\n00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.530\nSo, here we are then\nat program management.\n\n62\n00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.710\nNow remember,\na program is a set of related projects.\n\n63\n00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.760\nSo, we are still in this top left-hand\n\n64\n00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.250\ncorner where it says formulate change,\nbelieve it or not we're still here.\n\n65\n00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.550\nBecause you see at the portfolio\nlevel at this very top level,\n\n66\n00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.920\nthey are prioritizing the projects.\n\n67\n00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.475\nBut here in program level,\nwhat we're doing is we're looking at our\n\n68\n00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:11.370\ninterrelated projects, and we're saying,\nokay, where are our commonalities?\n\n69\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.660\nWhere are our resources\ngoing to be needed and when?\n\n70\n00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.880\nWe're looking at\ncoordinating the hardware.\n\n71\n00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.710\nWe're looking at coordinating\nthe resources, making sure that we've got\n\n72\n00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.040\nthe right amount of money to\nbe spent on the right project.\n\n73\n00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.150\nBecause the first project in\na series of projects were,\n\n74\n00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.480\nthat might cost more money than the last\none, or it might be the other way around.\n\n75\n00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.420\nSo here at program management, then,\n\n76\n00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.750\nwe are doing the coordination\nacross all of the projects.\n\n77\n00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.799\nThe other thing about program\nmanagement is that with a program,\n\n78\n00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:51.718\nwe may be in a position where we\ncannot realize the full benefit of any\n\n79\n00:04:51.718 --> 00:04:55.363\nchange until we've released\nall of the changes.\n\n80\n00:04:55.363 --> 00:04:59.020\nIn other words,\nuntil we've released all of the projects.\n\n81\n00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.676\nAnd when you think about Agile,\nand in an Agile environment,\n\n82\n00:05:03.676 --> 00:05:07.200\nwe release on an incremental basis.\n\n83\n00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.865\nSo if you think of the program management\nrole then as being the role that\n\n84\n00:05:11.865 --> 00:05:15.760\ncoordinate every individual\nsort of iteration,\n\n85\n00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.690\nevery release if you were, so\nin other words, every individual project.\n\n86\n00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.360\nSo we’re still here,\nat this formulating the change,\n\n87\n00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.335\nbecause here we’re planning the change.\n\n88\n00:05:26.335 --> 00:05:30.225\nWhat I expect program management\nto be doing at this point is,\n\n89\n00:05:30.225 --> 00:05:34.775\nI expect program management to be\nevaluating every single project\n\n90\n00:05:34.775 --> 00:05:39.805\nthat is within a group of projects,\nwithin that particular program.\n\n91\n00:05:39.805 --> 00:05:44.425\nAnd I expect them to be feeding back to\nportfolio management on the prioritization\n\n92\n00:05:44.425 --> 00:05:46.070\nof any given project.\n\n93\n00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.130\nAnd the feasibility of any given project.\n\n94\n00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.900\nAnd also,\nthe deliverable of any given project too.\n\n95\n00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.540\nThere may be interdependencies.\n\n96\n00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.430\nIf they're related, there probably\nis gonna be interdependencies.\n\n97\n00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.210\nAnd it might be interdependencies,\nwe can't do this until we've done that.\n\n98\n00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.330\nOr it may be, well, actually,\nI can't use Ronnie on two things.\n\n99\n00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.240\nSo, Ronnie's got to finish this\nfirst before he can then move\n\n100\n00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.680\nover to this project and\nwork on this particular task.\n\n101\n00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.500\nSo, program management is going to feed\nthat back to portfolio management,\n\n102\n00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.050\nbecause portfolio management\nare prioritizing.\n\n103\n00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.930\nSo what program management are doing,\nwell they're managing the program and\n\n104\n00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.755\nthey are managing the resources\nacross the program.\n\n105\n00:06:27.755 --> 00:06:32.130\nBut portfolio management will\nbe making the decisions, and\n\n106\n00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.200\nthey will be prioritizing.\n\n107\n00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.920\nThey are at strategy level.\n\n108\n00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.322\nSo think of program management\nas being at a tactical level.\n\n109\n00:06:40.322 --> 00:06:44.910\nSo they're managing across\neach individual project.\n\n110\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.250\nSo our next graphic here,\nis actually quite a good graphic.\n\n111\n00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:54.040\nBecause you see as far as the program is\nconcerned, what they're interested in\n\n112\n00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.760\nthe program management is the definition\nof the program, is that group of projects.\n\n113\n00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:06.930\nThen, the delivery of the benefits of\nthe group of projects in its entirety.\n\n114\n00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:13.270\nAnd then the closing of the group of\nprojects, again in their entirety.\n\n115\n00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.623\nWhereas the outer ring that we've got here\nwhich describes the change life cycle,\n\n116\n00:07:17.623 --> 00:07:19.873\nthat's at the individual project level.\n\n117\n00:07:19.873 --> 00:07:25.720\nAnd at the individual project level,\nthey're going to be doing the independent.\n\n118\n00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.025\nWell, we use the word independent but\n\n119\n00:07:28.025 --> 00:07:30.980\nI don't like it cuz it\ninfers working in silos and\n\n120\n00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.320\nof course we've got the relationships\nbetween all of those projects.\n\n121\n00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.250\nBut at individual project level,\n\n122\n00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.860\nwe're still going to be doing\nthe individual project.\n\n123\n00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.850\nWe're going to be doing the individual\nformulation of the change,\n\n124\n00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.150\nthe individual planning.\n\n125\n00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.370\nWe're going to be implementing changes.\n\n126\n00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:53.947\nBut I really don't want you to focus\non doing this in silos, please don't.\n\n127\n00:07:53.947 --> 00:08:00.924\nThe IT organization that works in silos is\nnever, ever an efficient IT organization.\n\n128\n00:08:00.924 --> 00:08:02.277\nAnd so, we want to.\n\n129\n00:08:02.277 --> 00:08:05.173\nAnd this is why we have\nprogram management,\n\n130\n00:08:05.173 --> 00:08:09.020\nto encourage the cross-functionality\nof the projects.\n\n131\n00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.320\nBecause without that cross-functionality,\nit's gonna be incredibly difficult to\n\n132\n00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:18.240\nachieve true efficiency, and actually\ndeliver value to the business as well.\n\n133\n00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:23.300\nSo across the program then,\nwhat I expect my program manager to\n\n134\n00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:28.740\ndo is to, well, it says here,\nidentify a need for change.\n\n135\n00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:35.250\nSo we've got to work out then who our\nstakeholders are and what they want.\n\n136\n00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.402\nAnd you'll see that we've\ngot a diagram here.\n\n137\n00:08:37.402 --> 00:08:41.560\nAnd this is what you call\na stakeholder management diagram.\n\n138\n00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.220\nAnd the stakeholder management\ndiagram is really about\n\n139\n00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.260\nunderstanding the level of\nengagement of your stakeholders.\n\n140\n00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.830\nAnd as I've said, we've got to work\non who our stakeholders are and\n\n141\n00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.460\nwhat they want out of\nthis particular project.\n\n142\n00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.562\nSo we do what we call\na stakeholder analysis, and\n\n143\n00:08:55.562 --> 00:08:58.597\na stakeholder analysis\njust simply does that.\n\n144\n00:08:58.597 --> 00:09:03.498\nIt analyzes the stakeholder and\nworks out how engaged they are,\n\n145\n00:09:03.498 --> 00:09:09.051\nhow much interest they have, and\nhow much influence or power they have.\n\n146\n00:09:09.051 --> 00:09:12.980\nAnd if we can just take a look\nat that particular diagram.\n\n147\n00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.400\nIf we can look at it in\nit's entirety there.\n\n148\n00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:20.370\nYou'll see that if a stakeholder\nhas high interest and\n\n149\n00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.320\nhas high power, and\nthen we want to manage them closely.\n\n150\n00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.290\nThey fall into that upper\nright hand quadrant there.\n\n151\n00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.694\nSo think about somebody\nbeing there as let's say,\n\n152\n00:09:31.694 --> 00:09:36.523\nwe were developing and delivering\na new suite of financial management,\n\n153\n00:09:36.523 --> 00:09:40.103\nmaybe Oracle Core Financials,\nto an organization.\n\n154\n00:09:40.103 --> 00:09:44.780\nSo your CFO, your chief financial officer\nwould fit into that top right hand\n\n155\n00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:50.205\nquadrant, because he's got high interest,\ncuz it's about a he, his business unit.\n\n156\n00:09:50.205 --> 00:09:52.944\nBut he also has influence and high power,\n\n157\n00:09:52.944 --> 00:09:56.632\nbecause he's the one with\nthe purse strings as the CFO.\n\n158\n00:09:56.632 --> 00:09:59.952\nAnd then,\na stakeholder that has low interest and\n\n159\n00:09:59.952 --> 00:10:04.774\nactually has very little power or\nvery little influence on the project,\n\n160\n00:10:04.774 --> 00:10:08.662\nwell, that would fall into\nthe lower left hand quadrant.\n\n161\n00:10:08.662 --> 00:10:12.327\nAnd that is somebody that\nyou just need to monitor.\n\n162\n00:10:12.327 --> 00:10:14.160\nYou still need to monitor them though.\n\n163\n00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:16.410\nWhy?\n\n164\n00:10:18.621 --> 00:10:22.370\nWhy do you think that is?\n&gt;&gt; The idea here,\n\n165\n00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:28.100\nwhen we start taking a look at the people\nwith the least power and least interest.\n\n166\n00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:33.128\nI would have to monitor them, it's\nbecause if we don't keep them motivated\n\n167\n00:10:33.128 --> 00:10:37.564\nthey won't continue to carry through.\n&gt;&gt; Kinda half way there.\n\n168\n00:10:37.564 --> 00:10:38.258\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH]\n\n169\n00:10:38.258 --> 00:10:40.256\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Remember what we talked about\n\n170\n00:10:40.256 --> 00:10:43.245\nin a previous episode about resistance?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n171\n00:10:43.245 --> 00:10:44.944\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and change resistance and\n\n172\n00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:47.320\nidentifying sources of resistance.\n\n173\n00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.960\nThose people alone are in the bottom\nleft hand quadrant there,\n\n174\n00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.180\nthe ones that we have to monitor.\n\n175\n00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.680\nWe have to monitor them to make sure\nthat they don't have any resistance, or\n\n176\n00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.180\nthat passive resistance hasn't turned into\n\n177\n00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.720\nactive resistance.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n178\n00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.230\n&gt;&gt; So we still have to keep them\n\n179\n00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.860\ninformed of what's happening.\n\n180\n00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.550\nWe have to keep an eye on them,\n\n181\n00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:12.560\nbecause these are the people that\ncould slip into active resistance.\n\n182\n00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.220\nAnd that's something that we don't want.\n\n183\n00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.470\nThat will prevent a change\nfrom being implemented,\n\n184\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:20.090\nit will prevent the project\nfrom succeeding.\n\n185\n00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.256\nSo that's why we still\nwanna keep an eye on them.\n\n186\n00:11:22.256 --> 00:11:25.220\nAnd once this is minimal effort\non that bottom left hand\n\n187\n00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.050\ncorner there of that quadrant,\nthat doesn't mean no effort.\n\n188\n00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.054\nIt just means minimal effort.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n189\n00:11:31.054 --> 00:11:33.760\n&gt;&gt; So be really careful with that.\n\n190\n00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.020\nSo we need to analyze our stakeholders,\nand\n\n191\n00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:42.640\nI've been asked quite a few times as to\nthe need for that particular analysis.\n\n192\n00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.210\nAnd I actually really like that analysis,\n\n193\n00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:50.090\nbecause it's a really simple way of not\njust identify who your stakeholders are.\n\n194\n00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.810\nAnd in previous episodes, we talked\nabout race and matrices as well and\n\n195\n00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:57.285\nabout roles and\nresponsibilities across our stakeholders.\n\n196\n00:11:57.285 --> 00:12:01.530\nBut it's not a way of just identifying\nwho your stakeholders are, but\n\n197\n00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:06.730\nit's identifying what type of impact\nthey have on any given project and\n\n198\n00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.160\non a program as well.\n\n199\n00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.365\nBecause the level of impact they have,\nwell,\n\n200\n00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:18.133\nthat should denote how important that\nstakeholder is to your particular project.\n\n201\n00:12:18.133 --> 00:12:21.261\nBecause somebody who has\na huge level of powera and\n\n202\n00:12:21.261 --> 00:12:26.041\na huge impact on your project is somebody\nthat you want to sort of keep happy.\n\n203\n00:12:26.041 --> 00:12:29.080\nAnd in fact, that's actually what it\nsays in that top left-hand corner.\n\n204\n00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.070\nYou want to keep them satisfied.\n\n205\n00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.770\nSo something else that we have to\ndo at program management then,\n\n206\n00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:40.490\nis we have to assess, again,\nthe readiness to receive the change.\n\n207\n00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:45.399\nNow we do this out portfolio level to,\n\n208\n00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:51.100\nwell, to help prioritize our project so\nthat we can see that\n\n209\n00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.360\nif you're not ready for a new particular\npiece of technology then there's\n\n210\n00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.820\nabsolutely no point in developing it.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n211\n00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.780\n&gt;&gt; Well, now we're one level down.\n\n212\n00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.800\nSo now we're at that program level,\nwhere we've assumed\n\n213\n00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.732\nthat Portfolio management has\ndone that readiness assessment.\n\n214\n00:13:05.732 --> 00:13:09.490\nSo we're assuming that they have already\ngone out to the business to see whether\n\n215\n00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:14.640\nthey're ready for the entire project,\ncuz if they haven't already done that,\n\n216\n00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.755\nthen we wouldn't have a program, okay?\n\n217\n00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:19.202\nIt would be somewhere down\non the priority list.\n\n218\n00:13:19.202 --> 00:13:23.438\nBut now it's in active program,\nnow we have to go out and see, okay,\n\n219\n00:13:23.438 --> 00:13:25.641\nwhat level of readiness they have?\n\n220\n00:13:25.641 --> 00:13:28.373\nHow ready they are to receive this?\n\n221\n00:13:28.373 --> 00:13:31.687\nAnd this is not because we wanna make\na decision as to whether we should\n\n222\n00:13:31.687 --> 00:13:33.010\nsomething or not.\n\n223\n00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.650\nWe might use that to make\na decision as to which\n\n224\n00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:40.190\nproject we should give the priority to\nin the group of projects that we have.\n\n225\n00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:44.700\nBut it's also to actually\nascertain what level of\n\n226\n00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.670\ntraining we're going to need to\ngive both our support teams, and\n\n227\n00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:54.880\nalso to give our users as well when\nwe deliver that particular change.\n\n228\n00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.960\nSo a readiness assessment\nis something that we\n\n229\n00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.010\ndesperately need to ensure\nhappens at this stage.\n\n230\n00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:06.250\nYou don't want to do it too\nlate into your project.\n\n231\n00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.800\nIf you do it too late into your project,\nyou get all the way through your project.\n\n232\n00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.520\nYou're just a month before you're\ndue to start on the transition, and\n\n233\n00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.690\nyou realize that the organization\nisn't prepared for this.\n\n234\n00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.920\nWhat are you gonna do, tread water?\n\n235\n00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.010\nAre you gonna sit on your thumbs for\n\n236\n00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.980\nthe next three months while\nthe organization gets ready?\n\n237\n00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.120\nOr are you going to rapidly back pedal and\nhope that you can catch up?\n\n238\n00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.235\nThat's a conundrum that I've\nseen a lot of organizations in,\n\n239\n00:14:32.235 --> 00:14:36.935\nbecause they have failed to plan\nadequately enough in advance.\n\n240\n00:14:36.935 --> 00:14:41.625\nAnd they fail to ascertain whether\nthe organization is simply ready for\n\n241\n00:14:41.625 --> 00:14:43.905\nany particular implementation.\n\n242\n00:14:43.905 --> 00:14:46.685\nAnd we have to make sure\nthat they are ready.\n\n243\n00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:53.100\nSo what we want to do as well is we\nwant to ensure that we're organizing\n\n244\n00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.690\nhere a program management.\n\n245\n00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:01.580\nWe're organizing the objectives\nof each particular project.\n\n246\n00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:07.040\nBecause again, that's going to\nhelp us to prioritize the project.\n\n247\n00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.830\nSo we've got a vision for our program.\n\n248\n00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.450\nWe've got a vision for these projects.\n\n249\n00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:18.500\nAnd what we want to do,\nis we want to use the benefits to then,\n\n250\n00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:23.410\nwell, the benefits should tell\nus what the outcomes are that\n\n251\n00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.590\nare expected by the business.\n\n252\n00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:31.478\nAnd we want to use that to help\nus prioritize our projects\n\n253\n00:15:31.478 --> 00:15:33.352\nwithin the program.\n\n254\n00:15:33.352 --> 00:15:38.815\nIf something's just a subsidiary sort\nof benefit, well, it's nice to have,\n\n255\n00:15:38.815 --> 00:15:44.210\nthen that's not necessarily going to\nbe your first project that you deliver.\n\n256\n00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.822\nBut it depends on the size of\nthe change though doesn't it?\n\n257\n00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:51.692\nBecause if something is just\na subsidiary benefit, but\n\n258\n00:15:51.692 --> 00:15:54.998\nit's only gonna take\n10 minutes to deliver.\n\n259\n00:15:54.998 --> 00:15:58.229\nAnd maybe you wanna get it\nout sooner rather than later,\n\n260\n00:15:58.229 --> 00:16:03.121\nbecause it adds to the visibility of the\nproject, and actually it builds up morale.\n\n261\n00:16:03.121 --> 00:16:06.087\nAnd adds to the visibility of improvement.\n\n262\n00:16:06.087 --> 00:16:11.564\nIt shows the uses that actually IT\nare doing something with your requests.\n\n263\n00:16:15.118 --> 00:16:17.944\nWhen it comes to prioritizing projects,\n\n264\n00:16:17.944 --> 00:16:23.040\nit's not just about delivering what\nwe think would benefit the business.\n\n265\n00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.250\nIt's also delivering what we\nthink would benefit us as well.\n\n266\n00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.520\nAnd if we can get something\nout in ten minutes,\n\n267\n00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.410\nthen maybe that's what we need\nto be concentrating on first.\n\n268\n00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:37.330\nThe other thing about that is that\nit not just adds the visibility to\n\n269\n00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:41.880\nthe organization, but it's a huge morale\nbooster for the project teams as well.\n\n270\n00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:48.130\nIf you actually achieved something,\nthen it is a morale boost to the team.\n\n271\n00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.920\nThe team themselves feel\na sense of achievement and\n\n272\n00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.050\nit motivates them more to go on and\ndo something else.\n\n273\n00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:58.360\nIf they don't achieve anything or\nthen can't see an end in sight for\n\n274\n00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.042\nthe next six months, or\nthey can't see a deliverable for\n\n275\n00:17:01.042 --> 00:17:06.040\nsix months, then think of the motivation\nand the morale of how are you going to\n\n276\n00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:10.795\nmaintain the motivation of that team for\nsix months, which is another reason why\n\n277\n00:17:10.795 --> 00:17:14.630\nAgile is quite successful\nan approach in project management,\n\n278\n00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:19.560\nbecause we are delivering on a continual\nbasis, on an iterative basis.\n\n279\n00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.300\nSo we have visibility,\nnot just with the business, but\n\n280\n00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.450\nwe also have that sense of achievement\non an iterative basis, too.\n\n281\n00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.800\nSo we have to understand the outcomes\nthat the business wants to achieve and\n\n282\n00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.736\nwithin each outcome,\nthen there are a set of results or\n\n283\n00:17:35.736 --> 00:17:40.310\na set of CSFs, Critical Success Factors.\n\n284\n00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:43.730\nYou'll also see the word,why, in there and\nthat is something I've mention\n\n285\n00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:48.490\nquite frequently throughout previous\nepisodes is, why are we doing something?\n\n286\n00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:53.200\nWhy does the business want to\nachieve what they want to achieve?\n\n287\n00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.450\nWell, what is it that\nthey want to achieve?\n\n288\n00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:01.770\nWell, we've got to work out what\ntheir critical success factors are.\n\n289\n00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.590\nNow I know that I mentioned\nthis in a previous episode.\n\n290\n00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:10.560\nA critical success factor, a CSF,\nis a factor that is critical\n\n291\n00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:16.160\nto the success of the project, and\ntherefore scaling that up to the program.\n\n292\n00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.320\nAnd so we can prioritize.\n\n293\n00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.880\nThere's one of three methods that\nare used there on this particular slide.\n\n294\n00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:27.520\nAnd obviously this comes from the project\nmanagement institute, but ultimately,\n\n295\n00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.360\nyou can use whichever method you prefer.\n\n296\n00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.550\nYou can use either a simpler rating\nsystem, this one's priority one,\n\n297\n00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.080\ntwo, three, or four.\n\n298\n00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.190\nOr you can use sort of\nproportional voting,\n\n299\n00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.328\nwhich one people thinks\nare the most important.\n\n300\n00:18:41.328 --> 00:18:48.260\nOr you can do comparative prioritization,\nwhich is just sort of\n\n301\n00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:53.080\ncomparing certain elements within projects\nand then working out exactly which\n\n302\n00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:57.730\nelements would be the biggest priority\nbased on which elements are shared.\n\n303\n00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:00.290\nIt's up to you.\n\n304\n00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:06.410\nThere is no right or wrong, except the\nfact that you have to have consistency.\n\n305\n00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:10.940\nSo however you choose to prioritize your\ncritical success factors, in other words,\n\n306\n00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:14.390\nhowever you choose to\nprioritize your workload,\n\n307\n00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.000\nyou need consistency across your project.\n\n308\n00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.520\nYou need consistency across your\nprograms and across your portfolio.\n\n309\n00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.140\nYou cannot do this in an inconsistent way.\n\n310\n00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:29.120\nIf you do this in an inconsistent way,\nthen\n\n311\n00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.700\neverything will end up as a priority one,\nbecause that's what generally happens.\n\n312\n00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.860\nAnd then, we end up with lots of\nfighting and lots of shouting about and\n\n313\n00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:42.020\nlots of [LAUGH] arguments about project\nresources or money or timeline.\n\n314\n00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:48.430\nSo all of these are what we would\nconsider to be influencers on this change\n\n315\n00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.550\nplan because we're planning a project.\n\n316\n00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.295\nAnd a project is a change.\n\n317\n00:19:54.295 --> 00:19:59.105\nAnd so we have to consider all of these\ninfluences, the people, people that were\n\n318\n00:19:59.105 --> 00:20:04.395\nimplementing poor, and the people that\nare actually implementing the change,\n\n319\n00:20:04.395 --> 00:20:08.940\nand what the need is, the CSFs, what is\nit that we're supposed to deliver, and\n\n320\n00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.060\nhow frequently we're supposed to deliver.\n\n321\n00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.318\nThat's that pacing.\n\n322\n00:20:12.318 --> 00:20:14.294\nAre we doing it in an agile way or\n\n323\n00:20:14.294 --> 00:20:18.040\nare we doing this in\na waterfall approach type way?\n\n324\n00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.100\nAnd how are we going to\nintegrate the projects together?\n\n325\n00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:24.560\nAs well as, how are we going to\nintegrate into the live environment?\n\n326\n00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.900\nAnd of course, we discussed in\none of our previous episodes,\n\n327\n00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:31.700\nwe discussed the culture of the\nenvironment and whether they were ready to\n\n328\n00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:36.420\naccept the change, and\nthen of course how frequently we release.\n\n329\n00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:42.170\nWe've already talked about the Agile\napproach, and our transition plan.\n\n330\n00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:47.390\nWhat type of DevOps and\nstructure do we have in place?\n\n331\n00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:50.350\nThat would be all our transition plan.\n\n332\n00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:54.480\nAnd so the approach that we\nuse is going to be based on\n\n333\n00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.970\nthe results of all of those\nquestions that I just asked.\n\n334\n00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:02.541\nSo planning the change and\nthe approach, and the methodology that\n\n335\n00:21:02.541 --> 00:21:07.517\nwe use is really going to be dependent\non what it is we want to deliver, and\n\n336\n00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:10.795\nhow those projects\nare going to work together.\n\n337\n00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:15.630\nSo think about our\nstakeholder engagement then.\n\n338\n00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:20.690\nAs I've already mentioned, we have got\nto consider who our stakeholders are.\n\n339\n00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:24.130\nWe've got to consider\nthe amount of influence and\n\n340\n00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:28.110\nthe power that they have\non any particular project.\n\n341\n00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:34.060\nAnd so we have to ensure that throughout\nour project, no matter what the duration\n\n342\n00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:39.600\nis throughout the project,\nwe have to engage our stakeholders.\n\n343\n00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.930\nI've already mentioned the RACI chart,\nokay, the responsible, accountable,\n\n344\n00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.330\nconsulted, and informed.\n\n345\n00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.010\nWe need to plan for\nhow we're going to integrate and\n\n346\n00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.700\nhow we're going to\nengage our stakeholders.\n\n347\n00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.830\nWe need to plan for\nthe communication with our stakeholders.\n\n348\n00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:56.710\nAt what level are we communicating?\n\n349\n00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.440\nAnd what exactly are we communicating?\n\n350\n00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:06.050\nAnd then what we're expecting from them\nthroughout the actual project itself.\n\n351\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:11.350\nYou will notice that what we're doing\nright now is we are talking about planning\n\n352\n00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:15.540\nand that's what we've done, is we've\ntalked about planning up until now.\n\n353\n00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.240\nBecause at program level,\n\n354\n00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.080\nwe've got to do a lot more planning\nthan you might actually think.\n\n355\n00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.870\nBecause when it comes to\nbringing in stakeholders,\n\n356\n00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.940\nthese are stakeholders probably for\nthat entire suite of projects,\n\n357\n00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.780\nwhich means that their involvement\nlevel may be quite high.\n\n358\n00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:39.564\nHow many people from the organization\ndo you know that want to get involved\n\n359\n00:22:39.564 --> 00:22:44.471\nat a detailed level in every\nsingle project that you're doing?\n\n360\n00:22:44.471 --> 00:22:46.151\nYou've got to get them involved and\n\n361\n00:22:46.151 --> 00:22:48.620\nyou've got to get them\ninvolved at the right level.\n\n362\n00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:53.130\nI don't know many people within an\norganization that's got 100% of their time\n\n363\n00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.370\nto dedicate to our project.\n\n364\n00:22:55.370 --> 00:23:00.120\nSo I mean, I know that we've got some\npretty good people within the business.\n\n365\n00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.480\nBut, nevertheless,\n\n366\n00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.790\nwhat the business wants is to be the\nrecipients of the benefits of the change.\n\n367\n00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:12.210\nAnd so this is why it's important that\nthis is done in program level and\n\n368\n00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:13.300\nnot at project level.\n\n369\n00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:19.480\nCuz can you imagine how\nirritated you'd be if I was\n\n370\n00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.400\nimplementing a project, and I asked you,\nokay, Ronny, can I have an hour a week?\n\n371\n00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.258\nAnd you'd say to me-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n372\n00:23:25.258 --> 00:23:25.990\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully, yeah?\n\n373\n00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:30.860\nGood, but then, if Cherokee came and\nask you for an hour a week.\n\n374\n00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:31.580\n&gt;&gt; Never.\n\n375\n00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.908\n&gt;&gt; Never [LAUGH].\n\n376\n00:23:32.908 --> 00:23:34.459\n&gt;&gt; Of course, of course I would, yeah.\n\n377\n00:23:34.459 --> 00:23:35.069\n&gt;&gt; No, you would,\n\n378\n00:23:35.069 --> 00:23:36.080\nyou would.\n&gt;&gt; I would.\n\n379\n00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:36.878\n&gt;&gt; And then, Wes came and\n\n380\n00:23:36.878 --> 00:23:38.634\nasked you for an hour a week.\n&gt;&gt; I would do it.\n\n381\n00:23:38.634 --> 00:23:40.069\n&gt;&gt; Right, and then Daniel came and\n\n382\n00:23:40.069 --> 00:23:42.230\nasked you for an hour a week.\n&gt;&gt; I would do it.\n\n383\n00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:43.009\n&gt;&gt; And Justin came and\n\n384\n00:23:43.009 --> 00:23:44.860\nasked you for an hour a week.\n&gt;&gt; I would do it.\n\n385\n00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.990\n&gt;&gt; All of a sudden though, you've\n\n386\n00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:50.200\njust used up six hours of your week.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n387\n00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.196\n&gt;&gt; Right, now you might be really really\n\n388\n00:23:53.196 --> 00:23:57.370\ngenerous, but not everybody's like that.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n389\n00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:58.942\n&gt;&gt; Which is why we've gotta do this at\n\n390\n00:23:58.942 --> 00:23:59.871\nthe program level.\n\n391\n00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:05.132\nThis is why, and in it's very simplest\nform, It's no good me coming to you and\n\n392\n00:24:05.132 --> 00:24:10.154\nasking you for a week, and then Cherokee,\nand then Wes, and then Justin,\n\n393\n00:24:10.154 --> 00:24:15.701\nand then Daniel, it's absolutely no,\nthat's not fair on you as a stakeholder.\n\n394\n00:24:15.701 --> 00:24:18.621\nSo what we need to do is\nput our hands together, or\n\n395\n00:24:18.621 --> 00:24:23.329\nsomebody a program manager needs to talk\nto us all about our requirements, and\n\n396\n00:24:23.329 --> 00:24:26.893\nthen they need to come up with\na solution that engages you for\n\n397\n00:24:26.893 --> 00:24:30.102\na certain amount of time,\nbut doesn't engage you for\n\n398\n00:24:30.102 --> 00:24:32.680\nthat entire six hours.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n399\n00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.180\n&gt;&gt; And so, this is what program\n\n400\n00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:38.460\nmanagement is doing, program management\nare planning that transition, and\n\n401\n00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.810\nthey are actually doing\nthe stakeholder engagement as it were.\n\n402\n00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:47.350\nThe other thing that we want to do is make\nsure that once we've got the stakeholder's\n\n403\n00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:52.100\nengaged, that we're able to sort of\nmobilize those stakeholders as well.\n\n404\n00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.980\nIn other words, well, we've got to\nkeep on top of them, cuz that's\n\n405\n00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:59.660\nsomething else that the program manager's\ngot to make sure is that, not only\n\n406\n00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:04.590\nare they not using up six hours of your\ntime, but the hour that I use in review\n\n407\n00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.960\ntime is an hour that's spent wisely.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n408\n00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:11.350\n&gt;&gt; I as a program manager do not want you\n\n409\n00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:17.260\nto be spending an hour sitting twiddling\nyour thumbs, because Cherokee didn't have\n\n410\n00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:23.160\nher information ready for you to get\nworking when you were available to her.\n\n411\n00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.110\nAnd maybe if that was the case,\n\n412\n00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:29.280\nthen maybe you could spend that\nhour this week with Daniel instead.\n\n413\n00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.770\nSo, as program manager,\n\n414\n00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:37.380\neven though we may think that\na program manager is a senior role.\n\n415\n00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:41.810\nAnd we think that the program\nmanagement role is a role that is, or\n\n416\n00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:45.350\nshouldn’t be involved in\nthat sort of minutiae.\n\n417\n00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:49.110\nProgram manager is a coordination roll.\n\n418\n00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:51.850\nAnd therefore, they need to ensure that\n\n419\n00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:56.540\nwe have the right level of coordination\nacross all of the projects.\n\n420\n00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.530\nUltimately what we want to do is\nto deliver the project outputs.\n\n421\n00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:04.970\nAnd we want to make sure that every single\nproject delivers the right outputs.\n\n422\n00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:09.750\nBut again, we're in program management\nlevel, so we wanna make sure that every\n\n423\n00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:15.190\nsingle project delivers the outputs\nin a controlled manner.\n\n424\n00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:19.940\nI don't want five different changes\nall happening all at the same time.\n\n425\n00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:23.810\nI can't cope with that,\nI'm just a humble user, I don't need that.\n\n426\n00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:26.750\nWhat I want is maybe one this week,\nand then one next week, and\n\n427\n00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:27.820\nthen one the week after.\n\n428\n00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.240\nOr maybe one this month, and\none the following month, and\n\n429\n00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.210\none the month after that.\n\n430\n00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:37.630\nSo that as a user,\nthen my releases are planned so\n\n431\n00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.350\nthat they're less disruptive to me.\n\n432\n00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.770\nRemember what we said\nin previous episodes.\n\n433\n00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:46.060\nIt's about maximum positive\nimpact on a project, and\n\n434\n00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:49.250\nminimum negative impact\nfrom implementing a change.\n\n435\n00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:56.295\nSo now, we've looked at program\nmanagement up to the point of actually\n\n436\n00:26:56.295 --> 00:26:58.935\ndelivering the individual project.\n\n437\n00:26:58.935 --> 00:27:03.965\nAnd when we come back in our next episode,\nwe're gonna take that one stage further,\n\n438\n00:27:03.965 --> 00:27:08.076\nand we're actually going to look at\ntransitioning those outputs, and\n\n439\n00:27:08.076 --> 00:27:11.065\ntransitioning the project as a whole,\nthe whole program,\n\n440\n00:27:11.065 --> 00:27:15.501\ninto the live environment.\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, thank you for helping us\n\n441\n00:27:15.501 --> 00:27:19.802\nonce again to focus in on what that\nprogram manager needs to really be doing,\n\n442\n00:27:19.802 --> 00:27:22.289\nas they start leading the idea of change,\nor\n\n443\n00:27:22.289 --> 00:27:26.761\nimplementing the strategic change that's\nbeen planned out for what we need.\n\n444\n00:27:26.761 --> 00:27:30.466\nIt really does help, because a lot of\ntimes it's easy to get into the weeds and\n\n445\n00:27:30.466 --> 00:27:32.290\nthink that you have to do everything.\n\n446\n00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:36.118\nBut here Jo is showing us that there's\nan importance, there is an order,\n\n447\n00:27:36.118 --> 00:27:39.328\nthere's an urgency to some of\nthe things that need to be done,\n\n448\n00:27:39.328 --> 00:27:41.768\nand the program manager\nhas to help us to do so.\n\n449\n00:27:41.768 --> 00:27:44.198\nBut there is more to come, so\nyou want to Stay tuned for\n\n450\n00:27:44.198 --> 00:27:47.750\nmore organizational change management,\nbut that is for another day.\n\n451\n00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:51.521\nSo signing off for ITPRO.TV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n452\n00:27:51.521 --> 00:27:52.582\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n453\n00:27:52.582 --> 00:27:54.264\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\n\n454\n00:27:54.264 --> 00:27:57.396\nmore of the organizational\nchange episodes.\n\n455\n00:27:57.396 --> 00:28:03.562\n[MUSIC]\n\n456\n00:28:03.562 --> 00:28:06.984\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:04.873 --> 00:00:05.556\nCalifornia.\n\n4\n00:00:05.556 --> 00:00:06.516\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:06.516 --> 00:00:08.354\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:12.814\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to\n\n7\n00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:15.519\nanother great episode\nright here on ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.425\nYou're watching\nthe Organizational Change Management show.\n\n9\n00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:20.120\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.000\nAnd today we're continuing on a part\ntwo on program change management.\n\n11\n00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.960\nAnd here to help us of course is our\norganizational change adept herself\n\n12\n00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.620\nis Jo Peacock.\n\n13\n00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.540\nJo, welcome to the show.\n\n14\n00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.210\nHow are you doing?\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me, Ronnie.\n\n15\n00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.320\nI'm absolutely great.\n\n16\n00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.330\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing well,\n\n17\n00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.530\nJo, as we're continuing on in this series\nand understanding more about the idea of\n\n18\n00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.200\norganizational change and\nprogram management.\n\n19\n00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.070\nI'm about to say project management here.\n\n20\n00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.550\nIn program management and trying to see\nactually where their place actually is in\n\n21\n00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.990\neverything, is very interesting.\n\n22\n00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.990\nSo Jo, where are we picking up here?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n23\n00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.710\nso, in our last episode,\nwe looked at program management and\n\n24\n00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.540\nwe looked at how we would organize\nthe projects within a program.\n\n25\n00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.860\nAnd so what we did was we followed\nthe program itself from its inception,\n\n26\n00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.480\nfrom the prioritization of\nthe individual projects and\n\n27\n00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.500\nthe coordination of the resources right\nthe way through to understand it,\n\n28\n00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.960\nidentifying who our stakeholders are.\n\n29\n00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.370\nAnd then mobilizing, as it were,\nthose stakeholders and\n\n30\n00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.120\nensuring that we get the right level\nof engagement in those stakeholders.\n\n31\n00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.700\nAnd now what we're doing is in this\nparticular episode we're going to be\n\n32\n00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.340\nlooking at implementing\nthe individual projects and\n\n33\n00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.480\nensuring that we have the right\nengagement from the organization.\n\n34\n00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.580\nSo those stakeholders that\nare concerned with the organization.\n\n35\n00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.540\nNow I've got to say something, and\n\n36\n00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.990\nI've gotta mention this right now\nbecause obviously we're looking at\n\n37\n00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.590\nthe organizational change\nmanagement of programs here.\n\n38\n00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.590\nAnd we're gonna use the word, both here\nand in the subsequent episode when we talk\n\n39\n00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.190\nabout project management,\nwe're gonna use the word transition.\n\n40\n00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.144\nTransition's a word that's been commonly\nassociated with service management and\n\n41\n00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:07.780\nit's about transitioning something\ninto the live environment.\n\n42\n00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.190\nAnd again,\nwe're gonna use it in that same context,\n\n43\n00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.950\nas transitioning a change into the live\nenvironment or into the business.\n\n44\n00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.210\nBut I wanna bring something else in here,\nand\n\n45\n00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.370\nI kind of wanna put a disclaimer in here.\n\n46\n00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.570\nBecause I've gotta say that I\nhave been into organizations\n\n47\n00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.290\nwhere the word transition simply\nmeans handing something over.\n\n48\n00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.480\nThat's not what a transition is.\n\n49\n00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.256\nWe've all heard the term DevOps, and\n\n50\n00:02:38.256 --> 00:02:42.020\nDevOps simply means\ndevelopment operations.\n\n51\n00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.737\nThat's where it came from, DevOps.\n\n52\n00:02:43.737 --> 00:02:48.810\nBut the DevOps concept, it's a mindset,\nit's really what it is.\n\n53\n00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.210\nIt's a mindset which, I mean,\n\n54\n00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.210\nwe have some great tools that have\ncome along to support DevOps, but it's\n\n55\n00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.080\na mindset where we look at the synergy\nbetween development and operations.\n\n56\n00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.035\nAnd where we actually look at that\ntransition between development and\n\n57\n00:03:03.035 --> 00:03:04.880\noperations.\n\n58\n00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.890\nLet's just say that Ronnie\nis my developer and\n\n59\n00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.940\nRonnie is really,\nreally good at developing.\n\n60\n00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.530\nAnd I'm not gonna detract from his skills.\n\n61\n00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.200\nAnd I'm a service desk manager, and\nI'm really good at supporting and\n\n62\n00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.350\nmaking sure that the service is supported.\n\n63\n00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.527\nAnd I'm not gonna belittle my skills or\nmy team either.\n\n64\n00:03:26.527 --> 00:03:32.169\nBut the fact of the matter is that\nwhen Ronnie just comes to me and\n\n65\n00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:36.640\nhands something over to me and\nsays, here you go,\n\n66\n00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.948\nhere's your new piece of software.\n\n67\n00:03:39.948 --> 00:03:40.830\nI'm not happy.\n\n68\n00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.010\nI'm not happy, and I have a really, really\nlow perception of Ronnie because of it.\n\n69\n00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.560\nAnd it's not his fault,\nbecause he's done his job.\n\n70\n00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.540\nBut nevertheless,\n\n71\n00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.680\nit's my team that are left picking up\nthe pieces when something goes wrong.\n\n72\n00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.920\nSo when support uninvolved\nin the development and\n\n73\n00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.560\nin the transition of a service learn\nRonnie doesn't know what to develop\n\n74\n00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.050\nbecause he doesn't know how the users\nare using a particular service.\n\n75\n00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.358\nSure, what Ronnie's done as a developer\nis that he has spoken with the users and\n\n76\n00:04:17.358 --> 00:04:19.462\nhe's gathered their requirements and\n\n77\n00:04:19.462 --> 00:04:22.726\nhe's developed something that\nmeets their requirements.\n\n78\n00:04:22.726 --> 00:04:29.269\nBut nevertheless, my team understand\nexactly how the user uses something.\n\n79\n00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.300\nMy team know it doesn't matter what\ninstructions you give the user,\n\n80\n00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.120\nthey're not gonna follow them.\n\n81\n00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.100\nThey're gonna do it this way.\n\n82\n00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.480\nBecause that's how they've always worked.\n\n83\n00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.060\nMy team know that even though their user\ntells you that they're gonna be working\n\n84\n00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.600\nuntil 5 PM every single Friday that\nthey always go home at 3 o'clock.\n\n85\n00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.220\nMy team know this, and Ronnie doesn't.\n\n86\n00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.280\nAnd so if Ronnie doesn't work with me,\nthen what's going to happen\n\n87\n00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.800\nis that Ronnie's gonna build what\nthe user requirements state.\n\n88\n00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.440\nHe's gonna build what the user asks for\nand he's gonna give it to me.\n\n89\n00:05:09.898 --> 00:05:11.890\nBut something's gonna go wrong, and\n\n90\n00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.890\nit's not necessarily gonna go wrong\nwith the way that he's developed it.\n\n91\n00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.960\nIt's just the simple fact that because\nRonnie doesn't know what the users really\n\n92\n00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:26.080\ndo, then the users are gonna use something\nin a way that Ronnie didn't design it for.\n\n93\n00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.460\nAnd guess who's picking up the pieces?\n\n94\n00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.000\nThat'd be me.\n\n95\n00:05:30.975 --> 00:05:32.381\nBut the other thing is,\n\n96\n00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:37.023\nnow what's happened is that because\nthe users are using it in a different way,\n\n97\n00:05:37.023 --> 00:05:41.735\nwe've had to put another request in to\nRonnie, because Ronnie's gonna have to\n\n98\n00:05:41.735 --> 00:05:46.440\nmake some tweaks to the program that\nhe's developed and to this service.\n\n99\n00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.040\nBecause it's not working quite\nthe way the users wanted.\n\n100\n00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.470\nAnd guess what,\nthe users were unhappy with it, too.\n\n101\n00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.040\nAnd they're unhappy cuz it doesn't work\nin a way that they want it to work.\n\n102\n00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.760\nEven though it ticks all of the boxes and\nthat meets all of the criteria that they\n\n103\n00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.800\ngave Ronnie, it still doesn't\nwork in a way that they like it.\n\n104\n00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.350\nSo you see, if Ronnie and\nI don't talk, we can tick a box,\n\n105\n00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.170\nbut we're not providing value.\n\n106\n00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.970\nAnd more importantly, we've got a definite\nbreakdown in communication between the two\n\n107\n00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.450\nof us, because quite frankly,\nright now, I'm not his biggest fan.\n\n108\n00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.550\nBecause what he's given me and\nmy team is a huge headache.\n\n109\n00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.230\nAnd then all he gets back from\nme is criticism and complaints.\n\n110\n00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.072\nAnd he's not my biggest fan either.\n\n111\n00:06:32.072 --> 00:06:35.310\nAnd so it doesn't help our relationship.\n\n112\n00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.600\nSo when you use the word transition\nin a project, I want you to be very,\n\n113\n00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.380\nvery careful of that word.\n\n114\n00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.630\nBecause transition does not mean handover.\n\n115\n00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.390\nTransition means simply that.\n\n116\n00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.080\nIt's a change of state,\na gradual change of state.\n\n117\n00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.750\nIt's a gradual move from\na development environment\n\n118\n00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.340\nto an operational environment,\nin this instance.\n\n119\n00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.093\nSo what we're doing here,\n\n120\n00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:11.069\nis we are transitioning a project\ninto the live environment.\n\n121\n00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:15.341\nWe are not handing it over, or\neven throwing it over the wall,\n\n122\n00:07:15.341 --> 00:07:18.090\nas I've seen in some instances [LAUGH].\n\n123\n00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.500\nSo be very careful when you\nuse that word transition and\n\n124\n00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.490\nensure that you are referring\nto the synergy that exists\n\n125\n00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:31.060\nbetween the development team and\nthe support team on your project.\n\n126\n00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.860\nAnd this the role of the program manager,\nto ensure that we've got the right level\n\n127\n00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.550\nof stakeholder involvement\non your project.\n\n128\n00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.440\nYou should have support people.\n\n129\n00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.880\nAlso on the project, they're to ensure\nthat the support aspect is covered and\n\n130\n00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.176\nthey're to ensure that the user\naspect is covered, too,\n\n131\n00:07:49.176 --> 00:07:52.154\nbecause it doesn't matter\nwhat the users tell you.\n\n132\n00:07:52.154 --> 00:07:57.837\nIt doesn't matter what they say they're\ngoing to do, cuz nobody knows that, right?\n\n133\n00:07:57.837 --> 00:07:58.449\nMy team.\n\n134\n00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.900\nSo the program manager\nis responsible then for\n\n135\n00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.960\nmaking sure that we've got the right\nlevel of commitment and involvement\n\n136\n00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.280\nfrom all of the stakeholders, including\nall of the support teams, as well.\n\n137\n00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.370\nAnd so what the program manager\nshould be doing is also then\n\n138\n00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.200\nat the transition of the project.\n\n139\n00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.500\nThey should be measuring\nthe adoption of the project.\n\n140\n00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:30.190\nAnd the adoption of that new service and\nthe usage of the outcomes,\n\n141\n00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.340\nas well and the usage of the output.\n\n142\n00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.605\nIs a project actually being used?\n\n143\n00:08:35.605 --> 00:08:38.660\nYou see that's something else\nthat I want to mention and\n\n144\n00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:43.780\nwe just got a slide there just to show\nyou sorta short, medium and long term.\n\n145\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.370\nBut something else that I wanna\nmention is that sometimes\n\n146\n00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.630\nwe get things wrong in project management,\nbelieve it or not, and\n\n147\n00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:56.000\nsometimes we might release something maybe\ntoo late and it doesn't get used at all.\n\n148\n00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.493\nOr sometimes we release something and\nit's not too late,\n\n149\n00:08:59.493 --> 00:09:04.213\nit's just that the users changed their\nmind and so they don't end up using it.\n\n150\n00:09:04.213 --> 00:09:07.867\nOr sometimes, because we didn't have\nthe synergy between Development and\n\n151\n00:09:07.867 --> 00:09:10.777\nOperations, then something is\nreleased that the users just\n\n152\n00:09:10.777 --> 00:09:14.100\nsimply don't wanna use anyway,\nbecause they don't work that way.\n\n153\n00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.850\nSo what we want to do is, when a project\nhas been released, when it's part of\n\n154\n00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.910\na program, we wanna make sure that we're\nmeasuring the results of that project.\n\n155\n00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.822\nSo we're measuring short-term results.\n\n156\n00:09:26.822 --> 00:09:32.450\nWhich is the assessment of whether\nthat project has been released,\n\n157\n00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.030\nis it being used?\n\n158\n00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.770\nAnd then in the medium term we want to\nsorta measure whether the application\n\n159\n00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:43.020\nis working, as in the application of\nthe project not the application as in IT\n\n160\n00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.110\nterms of the application.\n\n161\n00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.635\nIn other words, is it working well?\n\n162\n00:09:48.635 --> 00:09:50.370\nIs it working without errors?\n\n163\n00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.570\nAre they able to use it as long as they've\ngot the relevant amount of training?\n\n164\n00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:59.150\nAnd then in the long term we want to\nmake sure that a realization is there\n\n165\n00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.640\non the benefits.\n\n166\n00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.030\nIn other words, we've got a return on the\ninvestment, or value on investment return.\n\n167\n00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:12.310\nSo we want to implement in an agile way,\nbut\n\n168\n00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:18.360\nwe also want to ensure that we can measure\nthe success of our project, as well.\n\n169\n00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.260\nSo the program management\nis able to say yes or\n\n170\n00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.750\nno whether a success has been achieved.\n\n171\n00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:32.740\nAnd then we also want to ensure the\nprogram management on an ongoing basis is\n\n172\n00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:38.480\nmanaging the projects themselves\nthroughout the transition.\n\n173\n00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.000\nAnd we've got here, I love the words that\nit says at the top of these boxes here,\n\n174\n00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.512\nwhich is think success.\n\n175\n00:10:43.512 --> 00:10:48.299\nWe wanna have a positive approach to\nmanaging all of the synergy between\n\n176\n00:10:48.299 --> 00:10:51.900\nour project and\nto managing all of our stakeholders.\n\n177\n00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.790\nSo we talked about communicating\nactively and contributing dynamically.\n\n178\n00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:59.964\nThe last thing that anybody wants\nwhether it's a project manager or\n\n179\n00:10:59.964 --> 00:11:05.089\nwhether it's any sorta stakeholder is\nsomebody that's going to be dictatorial,\n\n180\n00:11:05.089 --> 00:11:09.698\nis somebody that is going to be sorta,\nthey say authoritatively but, no,\n\n181\n00:11:09.698 --> 00:11:13.091\nwe don't want somebody\nwho's gonna be dictatorial.\n\n182\n00:11:13.091 --> 00:11:16.687\nAnd we don't want somebody who's gonna\nbe sorta passive aggressive about\n\n183\n00:11:16.687 --> 00:11:18.010\ncommunication, as well.\n\n184\n00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.850\nI mean, I'm gonna hold my hands up here.\n\n185\n00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:26.598\nI will admit now that I am British and\nsarcasm is in our genes.\n\n186\n00:11:26.598 --> 00:11:30.460\nAnd I [LAUGH] can be one of the most\nsarcastic people in this world.\n\n187\n00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:35.490\nAnd in fact I was having a discussion\nwith Bonne about this just the other day.\n\n188\n00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:40.140\nAbout the fact that us British and\nwe were rude bunch where we want to be.\n\n189\n00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.150\nBut it's not that were rude,\n\n190\n00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.600\nit's just that sometimes we can\ncome across as a little bit blunt.\n\n191\n00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.190\nBut okay, I'll say what I think.\n\n192\n00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.128\nBut at least we can't be accused\nof being passive aggressive.\n\n193\n00:11:50.128 --> 00:11:53.345\n[LAUGH] We're just aggressive sometimes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n194\n00:11:53.345 --> 00:11:55.779\n&gt;&gt; But you wanna communicate actively,\n\n195\n00:11:55.779 --> 00:11:59.090\nwe don't want that passive aggressiveness.\n\n196\n00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:04.980\nThe last thing that you need, as a Program\nManager, is a group of individual projects\n\n197\n00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:09.350\nwhere they're all working in silos, and\nthey're not working as part of a team.\n\n198\n00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:15.535\nThey're not collaborating with each other,\nthey're because of your bad management,\n\n199\n00:12:15.535 --> 00:12:21.275\nbecause you have fostered a culture where\nyou fostered competitiveness across\n\n200\n00:12:21.275 --> 00:12:26.175\nyour projects, or because you\nfostered some sort of rivalry there.\n\n201\n00:12:26.175 --> 00:12:29.025\nOr because simply you just don't get\non with anybody within the project.\n\n202\n00:12:30.065 --> 00:12:34.645\nSo we wanna make sure in order for\na project to be successful, that across\n\n203\n00:12:34.645 --> 00:12:40.310\nthe entire program that\nwe are communicating and\n\n204\n00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:45.990\nmanaging in a way that nurtures\nrather than is dictatorial.\n\n205\n00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:51.170\nBut we still want to\nmake sure that we manage.\n\n206\n00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.110\nThat doesn't mean that we just sit back,\nput our feet up and\n\n207\n00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:54.320\nlet them go on with it.\n\n208\n00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.670\nWe still gotta manage because we've gotta\ncoordinate across all of our projects.\n\n209\n00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:05.090\nSo the next thing that I wanna come across\nhere is once we have implemented our\n\n210\n00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:11.820\nproject, we wanna make sense of,\n[LAUGH] well, the entire program.\n\n211\n00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:17.030\nAnd make sense of the entire program\nin respect to the actual organization.\n\n212\n00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.430\nAm I making sense to my team?\n\n213\n00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.040\nAm I making sense to my organization?\n\n214\n00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.351\nDoes the project,\ndoes the program make sense?\n\n215\n00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:33.460\nWe call this sense making.\n\n216\n00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.510\nAnd sense making,\n\n217\n00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:39.830\nwe've got a quick slide there that's just\ngiving you a brief description of this.\n\n218\n00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.910\nBy sense making it refers to the practices\n\n219\n00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:48.070\nenabling individuals making sense of\nwhat's happening around them, and\n\n220\n00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:52.990\nthat came out of the PMP book.\n\n221\n00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:58.660\nWhich is really about ensuring\nboth the organization\n\n222\n00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.740\nand the organization that\nare receiving the change, and\n\n223\n00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:06.280\nalso those that\nare delivering any change and\n\n224\n00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.710\ndelivering any project are able to\njustify why they're doing something.\n\n225\n00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:16.710\nAnd something that I've always applied\nto any team that I've worked with,\n\n226\n00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.840\nif you can't justify why you're doing\nsomething and I've mentioned this\n\n227\n00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:25.370\nin a few previous episodes as well,\nit's asking the question why.\n\n228\n00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:27.110\nIf you can't justify why,\n\n229\n00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:32.190\nthen there's not going to be the\nmotivation there to actually fulfill their\n\n230\n00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:37.960\npart of the activities and\nwhat their responsibilities are.\n\n231\n00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.810\nIf I'm asking you to do something and\nI'm not justifying why I'm asking\n\n232\n00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:46.500\nyou to do it,\nthen you're probably not going to do it.\n\n233\n00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:52.505\nIf I say to you, I'd like you to go and\nfill that cup up with water, and I don't\n\n234\n00:14:52.505 --> 00:14:56.205\nto explain that actually I'd like you to\ngo to fill that cup up with water because\n\n235\n00:14:56.205 --> 00:15:00.085\nthere's a plant over there and it needs\nwater and it hasn't been watered for days.\n\n236\n00:15:00.085 --> 00:15:03.825\nThen you might not go and fill that cup\nup with water or you might leave it for\n\n237\n00:15:03.825 --> 00:15:07.285\na few hours when actually that thing looks\nlike it's on its last legs right now.\n\n238\n00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:13.455\nSo we want to encourage the question why.\n\n239\n00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.820\nBut the same time, I want you to be\nprepared for the question why, and\n\n240\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:23.940\nany good program manager should be\nable to justify why we undertake any\n\n241\n00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:29.490\nspecific activity in any project,\nand in any program.\n\n242\n00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:33.560\nWhy are you using Ronnie for\nthis particular task?\n\n243\n00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.510\nWell, I'm using Ronnie for\nthis task because Ronnie is\n\n244\n00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:40.538\navailable at 7:30 on a morning and\nbecause Ronnie has skills X, Y and Z.\n\n245\n00:15:40.538 --> 00:15:43.490\nAnd that's what I'm using Ronnie for\nthis task.\n\n246\n00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:50.868\nAnd so when you approach Ronnie, cuz I\nlike to use Ronnie cuz he never says no.\n\n247\n00:15:50.868 --> 00:15:53.732\nBut when I approach Ronnie,\nI can say to him, Ronnie,\n\n248\n00:15:53.732 --> 00:15:57.979\nI know you're in at 7:30 in the morning\nand I know that you have these skills.\n\n249\n00:15:57.979 --> 00:16:00.795\nSo would you be able to do this for me?\n\n250\n00:16:00.795 --> 00:16:03.527\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; See, I told you, he always says yes.\n\n251\n00:16:03.527 --> 00:16:05.684\nHe never says no to me.\n\n252\n00:16:05.684 --> 00:16:10.448\nBut that's why I'm going to do that,\nbecause I want his commitment,\n\n253\n00:16:10.448 --> 00:16:12.730\nbecause I want his involvement.\n\n254\n00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:14.390\nSo, I'm going to justify why.\n\n255\n00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:18.640\nIf I just simply turned around to him and\nsay, can you do this tomorrow morning?\n\n256\n00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.330\nHe doesn't understand the priority,\nhe doesn't understand why I'm asking him,\n\n257\n00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.450\nand he might just push\nit to the back burner.\n\n258\n00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:31.900\nSo think about how your forming that\njustification as a program manager.\n\n259\n00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:36.440\nWhat you want to do is to have a committed\nteam that is going to help you to\n\n260\n00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:41.390\nimplement your projects and to deliver\nthe outcomes that the customers want.\n\n261\n00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.970\nIn a way then they can embed that change.\n\n262\n00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:46.980\nI mean that's what it say here.\n\n263\n00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:52.390\nWe talk about in the green at the top you\nsee we've broken down that lifecycle.\n\n264\n00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:57.330\nAnd in that green at the top it says,\nconduct sense making activities.\n\n265\n00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:01.869\nWhat we're trying to do is ensure that\nthat we understand our environment.\n\n266\n00:17:01.869 --> 00:17:05.414\nBecause you know understanding\nyour environment right now, and\n\n267\n00:17:05.414 --> 00:17:09.280\nunderstanding why a project is a success\nand what makes a project fail,\n\n268\n00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.140\nand why it isn't a success.\n\n269\n00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.260\nThat will help you in your next program.\n\n270\n00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.410\nSo we have to ensure that after\nwe've delivered a project,\n\n271\n00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:22.190\nthat we make sense of our environment.\n\n272\n00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:26.618\nBut we have to ensure that before\nwe even start on a project,\n\n273\n00:17:26.618 --> 00:17:30.527\nthat we are justifying why\nwe're doing something.\n\n274\n00:17:30.527 --> 00:17:33.256\nBecause if we don't, then quite frankly,\n\n275\n00:17:33.256 --> 00:17:37.110\nwe're not going to get the commitment\nfrom our project team.\n\n276\n00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.505\nAnd then of course, I've already\ntalked about benefits realization.\n\n277\n00:17:42.505 --> 00:17:45.995\nAnd benefit realization is, well,\n\n278\n00:17:45.995 --> 00:17:50.395\nwe've talked about short term benefits and\nmedium term and long term benefits.\n\n279\n00:17:50.395 --> 00:17:54.985\nBenefit realization is when we say that\nthis project has been completed and\n\n280\n00:17:54.985 --> 00:17:59.295\nwe have measured the benefits\nthat have been achieved.\n\n281\n00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:05.993\nThis is not a one-off activity.\n\n282\n00:18:05.993 --> 00:18:11.105\nYou don't just measure your benefits as\nsoon as you implemented the project and\n\n283\n00:18:11.105 --> 00:18:15.820\nthen walk away and say, well that's it,\njob done we did that one.\n\n284\n00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:21.806\nNo you don't, okay I expect benefits\nrealization to be done at implementation.\n\n285\n00:18:21.806 --> 00:18:26.030\nAnd then I expect it to be done three\nmonths later and then six months later and\n\n286\n00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:29.090\neven a year after project\nhas been implemented.\n\n287\n00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:33.410\nBecause for a start you cannot\nmeasure a benefit immediately.\n\n288\n00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:37.065\nBecause if we remember that\nemotional cycle of change, or\n\n289\n00:18:37.065 --> 00:18:42.225\neven we remember the Gartner Hype Cycle,\nwith the peak of inflated expectation.\n\n290\n00:18:42.225 --> 00:18:47.239\nAt the time of deployment\nthe initial impact on the live\n\n291\n00:18:47.239 --> 00:18:52.533\nenvironment is always?\n&gt;&gt; On the live environment?\n\n292\n00:18:52.533 --> 00:18:53.945\n&gt;&gt; A blank face.\n\n293\n00:18:53.945 --> 00:18:55.680\n[LAUGH] It's always negative.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n294\n00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:57.810\n&gt;&gt; Because it's an impact.\n\n295\n00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:00.890\nAnd it's always a negative impact.\n\n296\n00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.290\nWhen something happens,\n\n297\n00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:06.430\neven if you're just getting a new toy,\nlike I got my new watch that time.\n\n298\n00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:09.955\nEven if you're just getting a new toy it's\ngoing to have a negative impact on your\n\n299\n00:19:09.955 --> 00:19:11.140\nenvironment, because you know what?\n\n300\n00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:11.970\nYou're going to spend\n\n301\n00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.540\nfive hours playing with it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n302\n00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.170\n&gt;&gt; You're not actually gonna get\n\n303\n00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:16.730\nany benefit out of it.\n\n304\n00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.590\nSo that's not when you\nmeasure your benefits.\n\n305\n00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:24.033\nYou measure for benefits realization\nafter implementation, sure,\n\n306\n00:19:24.033 --> 00:19:27.880\nbut then you've gotta make sure that your\nbenefits are gonna improve over time.\n\n307\n00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.370\nAnd so you measure your benefits\nafter you've implemented.\n\n308\n00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:36.961\nAnd then at periodic times,\nto ensure that not only do you achieve\n\n309\n00:19:36.961 --> 00:19:42.070\nthe optimum benefits, but\nthat also those benefits are embedded.\n\n310\n00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.030\nAnd that the project is embedded.\n\n311\n00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:48.390\nAnd you don't go back to doing\nwhat you were doing before.\n\n312\n00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.880\nBecause that's something else\nthat happens within any project.\n\n313\n00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:57.350\nIs that people can go back to\ndoing what they had before if\n\n314\n00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:01.960\nwe're not able to embed that change,\nwe're not able to make it successful.\n\n315\n00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.080\nSo what we've done in these last two\nepisodes, then, is we've looked at\n\n316\n00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:12.730\norganizational change management\nfrom a program management level.\n\n317\n00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:14.370\nAnd in our next episode,\n\n318\n00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:19.320\nwhich we'd like you to join us in, we're\ngoing to be looking at implementation of\n\n319\n00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.250\nchange at a individual project level.\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo.\n\n320\n00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:27.110\nThank you once again for helping us to\nround out our bit of knowledge here on\n\n321\n00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.060\nprogram change management.\n\n322\n00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.870\nThere is a lot to cover and\n\n323\n00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:35.960\nsometimes we do forget some of those\nissues that're easily forgotten.\n\n324\n00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.300\nBecause we haven't spend\nanytime in doing it.\n\n325\n00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:42.220\nBut here Jo is actually introduced us\nto a little bit more of the concept and\n\n326\n00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.380\ndived a little bit deeper.\n\n327\n00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.870\nBut there is more to come, so\nstay tuned for that as well.\n\n328\n00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:50.650\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n329\n00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:51.540\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n330\n00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:52.569\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\n\n331\n00:20:52.569 --> 00:20:54.588\nmore organizational\nchange management shows.\n\n332\n00:20:54.588 --> 00:21:02.343\n[MUSIC]\n\n333\n00:21:02.343 --> 00:21:04.821\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:09.049\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.078\n&gt;&gt; You are watching IT Pro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:15.555\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another great\nepisode right here on IT Pro-TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:20.095\nYou're watching the Organizational Change\nManagement Show I'm your host Ronnie Wong,\n\n7\n00:00:20.095 --> 00:00:24.110\nand today we are taking a look at\nthe idea of product change management.\n\n8\n00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.276\nAnd here, of course,\nto help us out is going to be who?\n\n9\n00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.810\nOur leading project manager herself,\nJo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.770\nJo, welcome back to the show,\nhow are you doing?\n\n11\n00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.960\n&gt;&gt; I'm absolutely great Ronnie,\nhow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.870\n&gt;&gt; I am doing well Jo as\nwe continue on taking\n\n13\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.120\nlook at this idea of\norganizational change.\n\n14\n00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.140\nAt the beginning of the series\nI just kinda said, change,\n\n15\n00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.040\nwho needs to manage that?\n\n16\n00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.000\nBut now I'm starting to see\nthe benefits of what you're talking us\n\n17\n00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.260\nespecially on an organizational level.\n\n18\n00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.657\nSo on a personal level,\nI am still holding on to my TV.\n\n19\n00:00:50.657 --> 00:00:51.204\n&gt;&gt; No!\n\n20\n00:00:51.204 --> 00:00:55.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, you don't understand.\n\n21\n00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.732\nYou really, really don't understand.\n\n22\n00:00:57.732 --> 00:00:59.630\nWell, I'll have to give you\na bit of background into this,\n\n23\n00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.554\nhopefully you've watched the other series.\n\n24\n00:01:01.554 --> 00:01:04.297\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The other shows in this series but\n\n25\n00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:05.685\nthis man here.\n\n26\n00:01:05.685 --> 00:01:10.652\nThis man right here still has a cathode\nray tube sat in the corner of\n\n27\n00:01:10.652 --> 00:01:12.015\nhis living room.\n\n28\n00:01:12.015 --> 00:01:15.115\nApparently it's in a nice\nworn out box as well\n\n29\n00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:15.911\n&gt;&gt; It's a Zenith.\n\n30\n00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:16.485\nThat's right.\n\n31\n00:01:16.485 --> 00:01:18.065\nIt's a console TV.\n\n32\n00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:20.985\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what to say.\n\n33\n00:01:20.985 --> 00:01:22.535\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And he's not using this as\n\n34\n00:01:22.535 --> 00:01:26.357\na museum piece or as an antique either,\nhe's actually using this.\n\n35\n00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:27.829\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n36\n00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:28.507\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n37\n00:01:28.507 --> 00:01:31.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So when it comes to change management,\n\n38\n00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.195\nyou see the people that\nactually need change.\n\n39\n00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:35.483\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Jo.\n\n40\n00:01:35.483 --> 00:01:37.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Some people.\n\n41\n00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.148\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n42\n00:01:38.148 --> 00:01:40.394\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nsome people would benefit from change.\n\n43\n00:01:40.394 --> 00:01:42.109\n&gt;&gt; Who?\n\n44\n00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.403\n&gt;&gt; But what we're actually gonna do is,\nin this particular show,\n\n45\n00:01:45.403 --> 00:01:48.800\nwe're gonna be looking at\nproject management itself.\n\n46\n00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.150\nIn the last few episodes, we looked at\nchange of the portfolio management level.\n\n47\n00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.930\nSo we looked at change to our strategies.\n\n48\n00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.800\nAnd we looked at making strategic\ndecisions to implement change.\n\n49\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.990\nAnd then, we looked in program management\nand engaging all of our stakeholders, and\n\n50\n00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.010\nensuring that we've got all of\nthe resources across all of the projects\n\n51\n00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.770\nwithin the program to be\nable to implement change.\n\n52\n00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.880\nAnd now,\nhere we are at project management.\n\n53\n00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.790\nWe said everything we needed to\nsay haven't we in the last shows?\n\n54\n00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.766\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great Jo but I'm gonna say no-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n55\n00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:21.893\n&gt;&gt; Since we started a new episode\n\n56\n00:02:21.893 --> 00:02:22.614\n&gt;&gt; Yeah he's hoping-\n\n57\n00:02:22.614 --> 00:02:24.409\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n58\n00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:25.423\n&gt;&gt; Right, well,\n\n59\n00:02:25.423 --> 00:02:30.571\nwe're just gonna take a look at this from\na little bit more of an in depth level,\n\n60\n00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:31.196\nreally.\n\n61\n00:02:31.196 --> 00:02:33.651\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; And we can't be too specific,\n\n62\n00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:36.230\nI'll be perfectly honest with you.\n\n63\n00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.920\nAnd the reason for\n\n64\n00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.620\nthat is that every single project\ndelivers a different change.\n\n65\n00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.500\nAnd so\nif we were to get any more into specifics,\n\n66\n00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.050\nthen we would be starting to get into\nthe individual projects themselves.\n\n67\n00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.376\nAnd we would be getting into the nuts and\nbolts of each individual project,\n\n68\n00:02:54.376 --> 00:02:56.239\nin the development work, etc.\n\n69\n00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.870\nWell, I can't tell you how to do that\nbecause every single project is different.\n\n70\n00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.370\nWhat I can tell you though is that\n\n71\n00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.870\nevery single project does need\nto have a set of processes.\n\n72\n00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.560\nI know, I can hear you groaning right now,\nI know this, okay?\n\n73\n00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.870\nYou're just thinking about, really,\nshe's on about processes again?\n\n74\n00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.530\nThis is all that Jo ever talks about.\n\n75\n00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the fact of the matter is,\n\n76\n00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.150\nthere has to be consistency\nto your approach.\n\n77\n00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.460\nYour developers need to\nknow what to expect.\n\n78\n00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.850\n&gt;&gt; You can't reinvent the wheel\nevery single time you want\n\n79\n00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.460\nto deploy a new piece of software.\n\n80\n00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.610\nYou have to have things like deployment\nactivities that are consistent.\n\n81\n00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.360\nYour users need to know what to expect and\nwhen to expect it.\n\n82\n00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.650\nYour support people need\nto know what to expect and\n\n83\n00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.170\nwhen to expect it and\nhow to expect it, as well.\n\n84\n00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.250\nThere has to be some consistency.\n\n85\n00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.995\nIf we were to all just go and\ndo what we wanted to do, and\n\n86\n00:03:53.995 --> 00:03:58.485\nwe were to re-invent the wheel with\nevery single project, well, for a start,\n\n87\n00:03:58.485 --> 00:04:02.304\nthere'd be a lot of work that would\nget done that would be needless,\n\n88\n00:04:02.304 --> 00:04:04.872\nbecause it's already\nbeen done in the past.\n\n89\n00:04:04.872 --> 00:04:10.016\nWorking out a testing schedule and working\nout sort of testing environments and\n\n90\n00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:13.865\nengaging beta testers and\nengaging all the stakeholders.\n\n91\n00:04:13.865 --> 00:04:17.155\nThat may have already been done in the\npast, why on earth are you doing it again?\n\n92\n00:04:17.155 --> 00:04:18.265\nIt's just not efficient.\n\n93\n00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.270\nAnd if every single project\nis managed independently, and\n\n94\n00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.980\nit's managed in a different way,\n\n95\n00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.120\nthen just think of the chaos that\nthere'd be in your organization.\n\n96\n00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.990\nI don't know about here.\n\n97\n00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.220\nWell, I don't know about\nin your organizations but\n\n98\n00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.790\nhere we'd have chaos if we\ndidn't talk to each other and\n\n99\n00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.680\nwe decided to do everything\nwhole independently.\n\n100\n00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.680\nIf I decided that I was going\nto write a particular show\n\n101\n00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.750\nwithout involving the person\nthat I'm going to host with or\n\n102\n00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.690\nwithout involving somebody else in this,\nthen we'd have chaos.\n\n103\n00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.740\nHow would we know whether\nwe were overlapping?\n\n104\n00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.000\nThere'd be a lot of duplicated information\nout there and a lot of duplicate shows.\n\n105\n00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.830\nAnd you wouldn't really know\nwhich shows to watch, and\n\n106\n00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.980\nyou wouldn't know what benefits you\nwere going to get out of each show.\n\n107\n00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.530\nThen you might get little snippets of\ninformation in each individual show and\n\n108\n00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.380\nnot all in one place because\nwe weren't coordinated.\n\n109\n00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.490\nAnd that's the thing, that a cross\nproject there has to be collaboration.\n\n110\n00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.290\nAnd so it's directed by portfolio\nmanagement and it's managed,\n\n111\n00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.770\nthis collaboration,\nwithin program management.\n\n112\n00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.440\nBut on an individual\nproject management level,\n\n113\n00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.390\nwe still have a responsibility\nto uphold that collaboration, to\n\n114\n00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:41.180\nuse a consistent method for implementing\na project, and to have a plan.\n\n115\n00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.399\nAnd to have a tool that we're going to use\nthat's not only going to help us plan, but\n\n116\n00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:51.490\nit's also going to help us publicize our\nproject and manage our project as well.\n\n117\n00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.450\nWe also have to pay attention to\nwhat we call the human factors too.\n\n118\n00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.620\nInvariably, people don't like instability,\nand if we don't have a plan,\n\n119\n00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.940\nif we don't document it,\n\n120\n00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.300\nif we don't have processes to implement\nour projects and to implement change.\n\n121\n00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.770\nWhich is essentially what we're doing,\nis implementing a process.\n\n122\n00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.120\nI don't like uncertainty\nI don't know about you.\n\n123\n00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.530\nI have a saying, don't surprise me\ncuz no surprise is a good surprise.\n\n124\n00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.000\nAnd it doesn't matter what you\nsay about surprises being good.\n\n125\n00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.211\nI'm not going to believe it cuz generally\na surprise is always something that\n\n126\n00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:29.390\ncatches me unaware.\n\n127\n00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.380\nAnd I've gotta do something about it.\n\n128\n00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.410\nEven if you wanna get me flowers,\nthen let me know that they're coming so\n\n129\n00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.972\nthat I've got a vase ready, right?\n\n130\n00:06:39.972 --> 00:06:42.149\nSo don't take your users by surprise.\n\n131\n00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:43.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not a nice thing to do.\n\n132\n00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.790\nAnd don't take your teams\nby surprise either.\n\n133\n00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.400\nIf I suddenly went up to Ronnie today and\nsaid to him, by the way Ronnie,\n\n134\n00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.790\nI need you to develop this for me.\n\n135\n00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.070\nHe's gonna say, yeah but I've got x,\ny, and z that I need to do today.\n\n136\n00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.210\nSo, we've got to have a plan.\n\n137\n00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.510\nWe've got to have that coordination.\n\n138\n00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.370\nNow, we know that when it come\nto implementing change and\n\n139\n00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.360\nimplementing a project,\nwe know that we've got a rough plan.\n\n140\n00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.090\nAnd it doesn't matter whether\nyou use an agile methodology or\n\n141\n00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.010\nwhether you use a waterfall approach.\n\n142\n00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.760\nThis is how we want to implement change.\n\n143\n00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:20.450\nYou have seen this particular diagram\nin quite a few episodes before.\n\n144\n00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.370\nThat's that diagram that's just about\nto pop on your screen right now.\n\n145\n00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.290\nLook at that.\nSee, our director's wonderful.\n\n146\n00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.920\nYou've seen this in quite\na few of our episodes.\n\n147\n00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:34.360\nAnd literally, this is what we would\ncall the change life cycle in PMI.\n\n148\n00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.820\nAnd so we formulate the change,\nwe plan the change, we implement it.\n\n149\n00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.730\nAnd then we manage this transition.\n\n150\n00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:46.120\nAnd this is what we do in\nan individual project level.\n\n151\n00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.010\nWe're also sustaining or\nembedding the change as well.\n\n152\n00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.980\nSo project management,\nthe project manager is responsible for\n\n153\n00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.220\nensuring that every single\nstep that is listed.\n\n154\n00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.468\nAnd by the way, this is available in your\ndownloadable material, so please download\n\n155\n00:08:03.468 --> 00:08:07.600\nthe PDFs that come along with this series,\nand then you can see this in more detail.\n\n156\n00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.183\nBut the project manager\nhas an accountability to\n\n157\n00:08:12.183 --> 00:08:16.920\nensure that every single step happens.\n\n158\n00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.140\nAnd that everybody,\n\n159\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.560\nall the stakeholders that are carrying out\nthe activities in all of the steps, and\n\n160\n00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.790\nall of the stakeholders that\nare affected by all of the steps.\n\n161\n00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:31.880\nWhile the project manager has\nan accountability to ensure that\n\n162\n00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.730\nwe have coordination, and\nthere is communication, and\n\n163\n00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:40.660\nmore importantly, that we have\nthe results of each of these activities.\n\n164\n00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.350\nNow, this particular diagram\nthat I'm showing you right now,\n\n165\n00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.532\nyou have seen it previously, as well.\n\n166\n00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.314\nYou saw this in the program\nmanagement episodes,\n\n167\n00:08:50.314 --> 00:08:55.620\nwhere we looked at managing the projects\nthat are split within a program.\n\n168\n00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.826\nAnd you see in the middle that you have\nyour program life cycle that includes\n\n169\n00:08:59.826 --> 00:09:03.980\nprogram definition and program\nbenefits delivery and program culture.\n\n170\n00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.086\nBut what we've done here on the outside,\nand again,\n\n171\n00:09:07.086 --> 00:09:11.437\nthis comes from the Project Management\nInstitute, on the outside you will\n\n172\n00:09:11.437 --> 00:09:15.420\nsee each individual step broken down for\nthe project.\n\n173\n00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.010\nSo formulating the change,\nof course, formulating whether\n\n174\n00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:23.390\nthe decision is made at the strategic\nlevel within the portfolio and\n\n175\n00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:27.570\nthen the prioritization is made\nat the program management level.\n\n176\n00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:33.260\nBut formulating the change and planning\nthe change and implementing the individual\n\n177\n00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:38.760\naspects of the change,\nthis all happens at the project level.\n\n178\n00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.530\nSo the project manager is accountable for\n\n179\n00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:46.680\nensuring that we have processes\nin place to manage all of these.\n\n180\n00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.301\nAnd just to help you out, and\nby the way, there is no right or\n\n181\n00:09:50.301 --> 00:09:54.883\nwrong way because as I've already said,\nevery single project is unique.\n\n182\n00:09:54.883 --> 00:09:59.912\nSo there is no right or wrong way to this,\nso to help you out, we've given you\n\n183\n00:09:59.912 --> 00:10:05.570\nsome process groups here such as\ninitiating and planning and executing.\n\n184\n00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.700\nBut ultimately, you're going to\nhave to work the process out.\n\n185\n00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:14.560\nWe'll tell you, you need a process and\nthere are lots of frameworks that can help\n\n186\n00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:20.520\nyou and certainly the PMP framework\nitself, that can help you.\n\n187\n00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.080\nAnd then if you look at Prince 2 or\nusing Agile methodologies,\n\n188\n00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.290\nthen you'll find some help there in\nassigning sort of consistencies.\n\n189\n00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:33.175\nBut then also if we look at service\nmanagement and service management and\n\n190\n00:10:33.175 --> 00:10:36.880\nITIL specifically,\nthat has some very well defined\n\n191\n00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.280\nchange management processes\nthat can also help you as well.\n\n192\n00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:47.040\nUltimately think about the scale of\nthe project, the larger the scale,\n\n193\n00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.840\nthen the more intricate your\nprocesses will need to be, and\n\n194\n00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.490\nthe more processes you will have.\n\n195\n00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:57.740\nThe smaller the scale of the project, then\nthe fewer process I expect you to have and\n\n196\n00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.295\nthey all still need planning, though.\n\n197\n00:11:00.295 --> 00:11:04.136\nJust because its on a smaller scale and\nthat means there are less processes,\n\n198\n00:11:04.136 --> 00:11:06.477\ndoesn't mean that you\ndon't just plan them,\n\n199\n00:11:06.477 --> 00:11:10.260\nit doesn't mean that you just implement\nit, you have to plan everything,\n\n200\n00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.150\nbecause of course you have to deal with\nthe consequences if you get it wrong.\n\n201\n00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.860\nYeah, remember remediation planning?\n\n202\n00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.680\nThat should be part of, well, it should\nbe part of the planning a change.\n\n203\n00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.050\nWhen you plan a change,\nwhen you plan a project,\n\n204\n00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.330\nyou should always plan what you\ndo if it should go wrong as well.\n\n205\n00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.270\nSo that if it should go wrong,\n\n206\n00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:34.930\nthere are no surprises,\nremember we don't like surprises.\n\n207\n00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:38.720\nThere are no surprises and\nwe know what to do so\n\n208\n00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.640\nthat every single action within the\nproject including right at the very end,\n\n209\n00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:50.090\nwhich is sustaining that change and\nthen conducting benefits realization.\n\n210\n00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.930\nEvery single action should be planned.\n\n211\n00:11:54.128 --> 00:11:58.000\nNow, on our next slide,\nwhich is the very last slide for\n\n212\n00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.550\nthis particular episode that\nwe're going to leave you with.\n\n213\n00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:08.120\nYou will see various activities for\neach of those particular, well\n\n214\n00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:12.700\nwe call them sort of process groups that\nyou've just seen on the previous slide.\n\n215\n00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.730\nNow, this is something that I\nknow that this is very small, and\n\n216\n00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.580\nthese are just examples.\n\n217\n00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.466\nSo Ronnie said that I wouldn't\ndare tell you to do this, but\n\n218\n00:12:20.466 --> 00:12:22.505\nI'm gonna tell you to go away and read it.\n\n219\n00:12:22.505 --> 00:12:23.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n220\n00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.730\nCuz that's basically what you need to do,\nis go away and read this.\n\n221\n00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:32.720\nThese are just examples of the sorts\nof activities that you might\n\n222\n00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.900\nwant to undertake at each\nlevel within your project.\n\n223\n00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.720\nUltimately, when we first started\nthis show and I said to you that\n\n224\n00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:45.420\nthere is no right or wrong when it\ncomes to the individual project level\n\n225\n00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:51.150\nbecause quite frankly, I can't give\nyou explicit instructions right here.\n\n226\n00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.910\nSure I can come into your organization and\nI can help you and\n\n227\n00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.100\nI can give you an explicit instructions\nbut I'm not in any organization right now.\n\n228\n00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.260\nSo I can't give you explicit instructions,\n\n229\n00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:04.830\nwhat I can do though is give you\nsome examples then this is what I\n\n230\n00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:10.610\nexpect to see at each individual\nlevel within the project.\n\n231\n00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:14.195\nSo as I've already said to Ronnie,\nnow's your chance to go away and read it.\n\n232\n00:13:14.195 --> 00:13:17.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As always, we give you\n\n233\n00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.090\nsome downloadable material to sort of\nsupplement what we're talking about, but\n\n234\n00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:22.630\nwe are always available here.\n\n235\n00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:27.470\nSo if you do have any questions about\nanything that we've covered at all in any\n\n236\n00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:31.018\nof our shows, including this one,\nthen please feel free.\n\n237\n00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:34.410\nUse the Q&amp;A,\nuse the forums to come back to us and\n\n238\n00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.540\nyou can ask us any\nquestion that you want to.\n\n239\n00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:42.125\nSo for now what we've done is that in this\nparticular episode we've looked at sort of\n\n240\n00:13:42.125 --> 00:13:43.360\nproject management.\n\n241\n00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.765\nNow, in the last few episodes,\nwe've looked at change at\n\n242\n00:13:46.765 --> 00:13:50.033\nproject management level,\nwe've looked at change for\n\n243\n00:13:50.033 --> 00:13:54.920\nprogram management level and we've looked\nat change within the port folio level.\n\n244\n00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.994\nAnd when we come back in our next episode,\nwe're actually going to look at a word\n\n245\n00:13:59.994 --> 00:14:04.885\nthat's so close to my heart when it\ncomes to change and that's the word why.\n\n246\n00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:08.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why do we need to change?\n\n247\n00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:11.420\nAnd when you come back, and please join us\non this one, because when you come back,\n\n248\n00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.815\nwe'll be discussing why Ronnie\nneeds to change his technology.\n\n249\n00:14:14.815 --> 00:14:15.652\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n250\n00:14:15.652 --> 00:14:17.440\nI hope to see you on that particular show.\n\n251\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.422\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well thank you for\nguilting me into being there for\n\n252\n00:14:21.422 --> 00:14:22.150\nthe next-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n253\n00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.141\n&gt;&gt; Episode as well,\n\n254\n00:14:23.141 --> 00:14:25.321\nbut now remember that in this episode,\n\n255\n00:14:25.321 --> 00:14:28.640\nwe did take a look at the idea\nof project change management.\n\n256\n00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.470\nAnd there is a lot of information,\n\n257\n00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.080\na good information here that\nwe should all consider.\n\n258\n00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.380\nAnd very easy to miss if we just think and\nassume that we know it.\n\n259\n00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.610\nSo make sure you review this and\njust like Joe said, go away and\n\n260\n00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:41.605\nmake sure you read it.\n\n261\n00:14:41.605 --> 00:14:43.925\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be there for you as well,\n\n262\n00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:46.162\nbecause all that's gonna be\nimportant as you get ready for\n\n263\n00:14:46.162 --> 00:14:48.500\nwhatever exam that you're\nactually preparing for as well.\n\n264\n00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.960\nBut there is more to come, but\nthat's for another episode once again.\n\n265\n00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.360\nSo, for ITPro.TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n266\n00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.290\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Joe Peacock.\n\n267\n00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:01.220\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\norganisational change management episodes.\n\n268\n00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.358\n[MUSIC]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.030\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.682\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to\n\n5\n00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:15.210\nanother great episode\nright here on ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.260\nYou're watching the organizational\nchange management show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.700\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n8\n00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.470\ntoday we're gonna be taking\na look at performing the change.\n\n9\n00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.015\nAnd who better to help us than, well\nthe consummate change artist herself, Ms.\n\n10\n00:00:29.015 --> 00:00:29.930\nJo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.687\nJo, welcome to the show.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Ronnie,\n\n12\n00:00:32.687 --> 00:00:34.860\nhow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing well, Jo.\n\n13\n00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.350\nWe have talked about a lot of different\nconcepts in change management.\n\n14\n00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.170\nAnd now you are saying that\n\n15\n00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.540\nwe're gonna get ready to do\nthe performing the change here.\n\n16\n00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.068\nSo what are we talking about?\n&gt;&gt; Well we are, we're actually going to,\n\n17\n00:00:50.068 --> 00:00:52.130\nwell we're gonna do the work right now.\n\n18\n00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.394\nNow I know that in previous episodes,\n\n19\n00:00:54.394 --> 00:00:57.663\nwe have looked at organizational\nchange management.\n\n20\n00:00:57.663 --> 00:01:02.257\nThe big transformational change from\nthe perspective of a project, and\n\n21\n00:01:02.257 --> 00:01:05.502\nfrom a program, and\nalso from a portfolio as well.\n\n22\n00:01:05.502 --> 00:01:09.310\nWe've looked at how we\nwould justify change.\n\n23\n00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.927\nWe've looked at how we would formulate\nchange at every single level\n\n24\n00:01:13.927 --> 00:01:17.977\nwithin portfolio management and\nprogram management, and\n\n25\n00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:20.491\nalso in project management as well.\n\n26\n00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:25.946\nBut one of the things that I've said in\nevery single episode, really, is the fact\n\n27\n00:01:25.946 --> 00:01:31.417\nthat you cannot, and we can't, dictate\nexactly how you'll change processes.\n\n28\n00:01:31.417 --> 00:01:34.297\nIn other words,\nhow that project should look,\n\n29\n00:01:34.297 --> 00:01:39.050\nhow you actually plan your change, and\nhow you actually perform your change.\n\n30\n00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.640\nAnd we can't, we still can't.\n\n31\n00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.165\nHowever, there are certain\nthings that we have to do for\n\n32\n00:01:44.165 --> 00:01:46.646\nevery single organizational change.\n\n33\n00:01:46.646 --> 00:01:49.325\nI'm bearing in mind that,\nin organizational change,\n\n34\n00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:51.320\nwe've got to bring in the people as well.\n\n35\n00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.312\nWe have to factor in the people.\n\n36\n00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:55.162\nBecause as I always say, and\n\n37\n00:01:55.162 --> 00:01:58.270\nI'll say it again just because I like to.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n38\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.827\n&gt;&gt; But all we need is one negative\n\n39\n00:01:59.827 --> 00:02:04.125\nperson and that's going to undermine\nthe effects of 500 positive people, and\n\n40\n00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:06.930\nthat's exactly what we don't want to do.\n\n41\n00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.150\nSo we have to remember our people and we\nhave to perform the relevant stakeholder\n\n42\n00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.230\nmanagement, as we've discussed\nin a lot of previous episodes.\n\n43\n00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.553\nSo what we're actually going to do\nnow then, is we're actually going to,\n\n44\n00:02:18.553 --> 00:02:21.794\nwell we're gonna plan the change,\nwe're gonna implement the change.\n\n45\n00:02:21.794 --> 00:02:27.386\nSo we're gonna start off by\nformulating the change at any level.\n\n46\n00:02:27.386 --> 00:02:31.758\nWhether it's at portfolio level, whether\nit's at program level, or whether it's\n\n47\n00:02:31.758 --> 00:02:35.720\nat project level, we're first of all\ngoing to have to formulate the change.\n\n48\n00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.262\nAnd if you remember, and I'm actually\ngoing to, I was looking at one particular\n\n49\n00:02:39.262 --> 00:02:42.940\nslide, but what I'm gonna do is I'm\njust gonna is backtrack a little bit.\n\n50\n00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.517\nBut if you remember this particular slide,\nand this one looked at project management\n\n51\n00:02:48.517 --> 00:02:53.330\nspecifically, but this is what we\ncall the Change Life Cycle Framework.\n\n52\n00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.020\nAnd if you remember,\nit split up into, well, sections.\n\n53\n00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.329\nSo we have a section for formulating\nthe change, we have a section for\n\n54\n00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:02.420\nplanning the change.\n\n55\n00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.677\nAnd we have a section for\nimplementing, and\n\n56\n00:03:05.677 --> 00:03:10.000\nthen managing the transition and\nsustaining the change.\n\n57\n00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.128\nThat's embedding the change.\n\n58\n00:03:12.128 --> 00:03:13.380\nSo here we are then,\n\n59\n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.250\nin this particular episode we're actually\ngoing to be looking at all of this.\n\n60\n00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.933\nWe're gonna be looking at how we\nactually implement the change.\n\n61\n00:03:21.933 --> 00:03:25.329\nLet's take a look at some of\nthe practicalities of this.\n\n62\n00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.665\nSo the first thing that I'm gonna do is,\n\n63\n00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:31.804\nI'm going to quickly jump with this\nparticular, yes, and it worked.\n\n64\n00:03:31.804 --> 00:03:37.165\nSo I'm just gonna take us through\nthese particular stages here,\n\n65\n00:03:37.165 --> 00:03:42.533\nbecause in formulating the change\nwhat do we actually have to do?\n\n66\n00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:45.964\nWhether we're at portfolio level,\nwhether we're at program level, or\n\n67\n00:03:45.964 --> 00:03:47.580\nwhether we're at project level.\n\n68\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.520\nWe have got to,\nwell that first column there,\n\n69\n00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.574\nidentify any other\nresources that we may need.\n\n70\n00:03:55.574 --> 00:04:02.948\nThis is any other activities that fall\noutside of the boundaries of the project.\n\n71\n00:04:02.948 --> 00:04:07.150\nSo let's think about something that\nmaybe a supplier may bring in to us.\n\n72\n00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.293\nSomething that an external vendor,\nan external supply may bring to us.\n\n73\n00:04:13.293 --> 00:04:18.488\nSomething that a customer may\nbring to the change as well.\n\n74\n00:04:18.488 --> 00:04:20.520\nSo at this particular point,\n\n75\n00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.250\nwhat we want to do is identify who\nany of these additional people are.\n\n76\n00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.030\nWe know who we've got in our project and\nwe know who we've got in our program.\n\n77\n00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.300\nWe know who we've got\nwithin our portfolio.\n\n78\n00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.730\nAnd don't forget both portfolio management\nand program management are responsible for\n\n79\n00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.900\nensuring that we've got\nthe right resources.\n\n80\n00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.110\nSo here we have to identify where\nthe overlaps of these resources are and\n\n81\n00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.370\nwhere we need additional resources.\n\n82\n00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.511\nAnd that means we've got to\nidentify the stakeholders,\n\n83\n00:04:50.511 --> 00:04:54.660\nas well as identify in\nthe expectations for each change.\n\n84\n00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.250\nThis is on that second column.\n\n85\n00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.151\nWhat does every single stakeholder\nwant out of each change?\n\n86\n00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:04.583\nWhat am I expecting to see?\n\n87\n00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:10.379\nSometimes we write things down and\nwe like to publicize things,\n\n88\n00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.059\nmaybe service exceptions, criteria,\n\n89\n00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:17.970\nthe sort of the things that we're going\nto deliver as part of the project.\n\n90\n00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.540\nAnd sometimes different people have\ndifferent understandings as to what's been\n\n91\n00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.220\nwritten down.\n\n92\n00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:30.240\nNow if I were to read certain things, I'd\nprobably have one interpretation on it,\n\n93\n00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.090\nand Ronnie may well have\na different interpretation too.\n\n94\n00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.687\nAnd that's unfortunately the way\nthat everything happens.\n\n95\n00:05:37.687 --> 00:05:41.590\nIs that we all read something,\nit's a bit like going to the movies.\n\n96\n00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.130\nI don't know,\n\n97\n00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.830\nwe were talking in the office about\ngoing to a movie just the other day.\n\n98\n00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.160\nAnd now people are reading the book,\nbecause they've gone to see the movie and\n\n99\n00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.770\nthen they're saying,\n\n100\n00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.940\nwell the book reads something\ncompletely different to the movie.\n\n101\n00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.205\nAnd I always say, one of the reasons why\nI'm here is because you can go away and\n\n102\n00:05:59.205 --> 00:06:01.879\nread a book, nothing wrong with that.\n\n103\n00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:06.517\nBut why I'm here is to make sure that you\nput the right interpretation on that book.\n\n104\n00:06:06.517 --> 00:06:10.114\nBecause you see, your interpretation\non what you've read is different from,\n\n105\n00:06:10.114 --> 00:06:12.539\nsay Ronnie's interpretation\non what you've read.\n\n106\n00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.772\nWhich happens to also be different\non the movie producer and\n\n107\n00:06:15.772 --> 00:06:19.576\ndirector's interpretation on\nwhat they've read as well.\n\n108\n00:06:19.576 --> 00:06:24.230\nWhat my role is, is to make sure that\nyou actually have the interpretation\n\n109\n00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.992\nof whatever has been\nwritten down of the author.\n\n110\n00:06:27.992 --> 00:06:33.140\nYou are the author's interpretation,\nand so that why we have training,\n\n111\n00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:38.800\nbecause training ensures that we will have\nthat consistency in our interpretation.\n\n112\n00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.760\nAnd so when it comes to our expectation\nsetting we've got to make sure that,\n\n113\n00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.150\nwith any change, whether it is\na portfolio or program or project level.\n\n114\n00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.687\nThat the person that's responsible for\nthat project or for\n\n115\n00:06:53.687 --> 00:06:58.870\nthe portfolio or for the program,\nis able to manage expectations.\n\n116\n00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.011\nI think you made a comment actually\na little while ago, Ronnie.\n\n117\n00:07:03.011 --> 00:07:05.964\nAnd it might have been\nin a previous episode or\n\n118\n00:07:05.964 --> 00:07:11.740\nit might have been outside of an episode,\nsomething about under or over-delivering?\n\n119\n00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.650\nSetting expectations at a certain level\nand then making sure that we over-deliver\n\n120\n00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.891\non those expectations.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n121\n00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:21.867\nThe one thing that you don't want to\ndo is over set the expectations and\n\n122\n00:07:21.867 --> 00:07:23.399\nthen under-deliver.\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n123\n00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:26.261\n&gt;&gt; Because you lose all your integrity as\n\n124\n00:07:26.261 --> 00:07:30.733\na service provider, and\nas a supplier of an IT service, and\n\n125\n00:07:30.733 --> 00:07:34.670\nas a supplier of a product\nwithin a project.\n\n126\n00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:39.159\nYou don't wanna miss-set expectations,\nso that's why its very important,\n\n127\n00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:41.839\nit's key when we're\nformulating the change,\n\n128\n00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:45.397\nto ensure that we understand who\nevery single stakeholder is.\n\n129\n00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:51.077\nAnd remember from a previous episode,\na stakeholder is an interested party.\n\n130\n00:07:51.077 --> 00:07:54.463\nSo we understand who those\nstakeholders are and\n\n131\n00:07:54.463 --> 00:07:57.771\nthen we set their\nexpectations accordingly.\n\n132\n00:07:57.771 --> 00:08:02.750\nBeing very, very careful that we don't\nwant to overpromise and underdeliver.\n\n133\n00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.050\nWe want to underpromise and\nthen overdeliver.\n\n134\n00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:11.030\nAnd then what we also have to do is\nensure that we coordinate all of\n\n135\n00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.250\nthe activities that all of these\nstakeholders are performing.\n\n136\n00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.360\nSo the stakeholders,\nsome of them may just be.\n\n137\n00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.100\nRemember, I talked about a RACI matrix,\nas well, in a previous episode.\n\n138\n00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.930\nSome of the stakeholders\nmay just be informed.\n\n139\n00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.080\nAnd, therefore, their activities are,\n\n140\n00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.000\nwell, actually I'm gonna\nask this question.\n\n141\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.120\nSo if a stakeholder was just informed or\nsomething, if I'm just telling you about\n\n142\n00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.806\nsomething, do you have a responsibility?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if I have a real\n\n143\n00:08:39.806 --> 00:08:46.382\nresponsibility in the change itself as\nmuch as just to be able to acknowledge\n\n144\n00:08:46.382 --> 00:08:52.430\nthat I've received the information.\n&gt;&gt; Should I tell him?\n\n145\n00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.694\nThat's wrong.\n&gt;&gt; Well there you go.\n\n146\n00:08:55.694 --> 00:08:57.977\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Communication is a two-way\n\n147\n00:08:57.977 --> 00:08:58.850\nprocess.\n\n148\n00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:00.921\nYou have a responsibility\nto tell me if you didn't\n\n149\n00:09:00.921 --> 00:09:02.489\nunderstand something.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n150\n00:09:02.489 --> 00:09:04.735\n&gt;&gt; And you also have a responsibility\n\n151\n00:09:04.735 --> 00:09:09.540\nto tell me if you want clarification,\nif you'd like me to rephrase it, or\n\n152\n00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.725\nif you didn't like what you've been told.\n\n153\n00:09:12.725 --> 00:09:16.425\nSo that's not necessarily just\nabout not understanding it,\n\n154\n00:09:16.425 --> 00:09:19.615\nbut it's whether you didn't\nlike what's being told.\n\n155\n00:09:19.615 --> 00:09:22.545\nRemember what I said to you right at\nthe beginning of this episode is that\n\n156\n00:09:22.545 --> 00:09:26.447\none negative person can\nundermine 500 positive people.\n\n157\n00:09:26.447 --> 00:09:27.725\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, Jo, if\n\n158\n00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:33.610\nI am not a part of the organization,\nwhy does it matter if you inform me and\n\n159\n00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.270\nI don't like it?\n&gt;&gt; Because you talk to\n\n160\n00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.550\npeople.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n161\n00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.280\n&gt;&gt; And you'll talk to people within my\n\n162\n00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.260\norganization, and\nyou might sow the seeds of doubt.\n\n163\n00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.690\nMore importantly, you might have a better\nway of doing something that I didn't know\n\n164\n00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.510\nanything about.\n\n165\n00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.200\nSo you do have a responsibility\nto feed that back,\n\n166\n00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.030\nespecially if it's going\nto impact your life.\n\n167\n00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.700\nLet's say you were a supplier and\nI was purchasing something from you,\n\n168\n00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:03.710\nas part of a project I was purchasing\na particular product from you.\n\n169\n00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:04.560\nAnd I went to you and\n\n170\n00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.840\nI said, okay, then this is the date\nthat I need the product by.\n\n171\n00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.460\nYou can either just sit there and say,\nokay, then fine, I've been informed.\n\n172\n00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.360\nOr you could come back to me and\nsay, well, do you know what?\n\n173\n00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.256\nWe've got a new release of\nthat product due a week later.\n\n174\n00:10:19.256 --> 00:10:23.877\nSo how about you hold off for a week and\nwe can get you the latest version?\n\n175\n00:10:25.955 --> 00:10:29.403\nEasier for you to support because you\nwill be supporting it in the long\n\n176\n00:10:29.403 --> 00:10:30.165\nrun.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n177\n00:10:30.165 --> 00:10:32.589\n&gt;&gt; Potentially easier for you to support,\n\n178\n00:10:32.589 --> 00:10:35.162\nbut you would have some influence in that.\n\n179\n00:10:35.162 --> 00:10:38.642\nNow, you might turn round to me, you might\nchallenge me, and you might say to me,\n\n180\n00:10:38.642 --> 00:10:41.710\nwell, in that case then what\nI'm doing is consulting Ronnie.\n\n181\n00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:42.803\nNo, I wasn't.\n\n182\n00:10:42.803 --> 00:10:45.148\nI was telling him what\nmy requirements were.\n\n183\n00:10:45.148 --> 00:10:48.290\nI wasn't asking for his opinion.\n\n184\n00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.250\nI was telling him what\nmy requirements were.\n\n185\n00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:55.030\nBut ultimately he was gonna be impacted\nin that particular scenario so\n\n186\n00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.580\nI'm gonna tell you.\n\n187\n00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.650\nAnd you have a responsibility to\ntell me if there's something that\n\n188\n00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.220\nyou want included in my consideration.\n\n189\n00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.800\nYou have a responsibility\nto give me your opinions.\n\n190\n00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.110\nYour opinion might just be, and\nwhich it is in a lot of cases, when\n\n191\n00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.740\nyou get something on email, let's face it,\nand you just say, yeah, that's great.\n\n192\n00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.860\nAnd then that's as much as you send back.\n\n193\n00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.950\nThat might be your involvement.\n\n194\n00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.986\nBut, nevertheless,\neven if you're just informed,\n\n195\n00:11:23.986 --> 00:11:26.499\nyou have a responsibility\nto feed that back.\n\n196\n00:11:28.334 --> 00:11:29.530\nHe doesn't look convinced.\n\n197\n00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:30.740\nEither that or\n\n198\n00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.964\nhe doesn't look happy about it.\n&gt;&gt; The idea here, again,\n\n199\n00:11:34.964 --> 00:11:39.375\nI kind of think about this,\nif they are just on the periphery and\n\n200\n00:11:39.375 --> 00:11:45.138\neven though they are a stakeholder in\na sense, there's no real responsibility.\n\n201\n00:11:45.138 --> 00:11:49.456\nIf you change, I just have to deal with\nit, except for the fact that I might be\n\n202\n00:11:49.456 --> 00:11:51.300\nable to influence someone.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n203\n00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.370\n&gt;&gt; But not necessarily\n\n204\n00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:53.760\nI would influence someone.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n205\n00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.970\nyou might be able to influence something.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n206\n00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:56.840\n&gt;&gt; And that's the thing,\n\n207\n00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.840\nyou will never know.\n\n208\n00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.910\nIf I don't give you the opportunity,\nthen you are going to be much more\n\n209\n00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:07.980\nnegative about any change than\nif I gave you the opportunity.\n\n210\n00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:13.345\nFrom a project management prospective, if\nI give you the opportunity to be involved,\n\n211\n00:12:13.345 --> 00:12:17.695\nthen at least I'm identifying any\npotential sources of resistance.\n\n212\n00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:19.227\nAnd I've given you the opportunity.\n\n213\n00:12:19.227 --> 00:12:21.166\nYou haven't come back and\nsaid anything else.\n\n214\n00:12:21.166 --> 00:12:24.282\nSo, therefore,\nwhat I can do is I can say, well,\n\n215\n00:12:24.282 --> 00:12:27.910\nat least I've given Ronnie\nthe opportunity to respond.\n\n216\n00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.335\nHe hasn't responded.\n\n217\n00:12:29.335 --> 00:12:33.811\nTherefore, I've either got to,\ndepending on how well I know Ronnie,\n\n218\n00:12:33.811 --> 00:12:37.623\nI've either got to eliminate\nhim as a source of resistance.\n\n219\n00:12:37.623 --> 00:12:41.876\nOr actually I should be incredibly\nworried because he may become a source of\n\n220\n00:12:41.876 --> 00:12:44.519\nresistance because he\nhasn't got back to me.\n\n221\n00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:49.808\nIt's really important that we\nengage our stakeholders so\n\n222\n00:12:49.808 --> 00:12:54.576\nwe understand who our stakeholders are,\nand what their responsibilities are, and\n\n223\n00:12:54.576 --> 00:12:57.450\nwhat we actually expect from them.\n\n224\n00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:01.785\nAnd when we expect those\nactivities to happen, as well.\n\n225\n00:13:01.785 --> 00:13:03.887\nAnd then what we also need to do is,\n\n226\n00:13:03.887 --> 00:13:06.788\nit says here delineate\nthe scope of the change.\n\n227\n00:13:06.788 --> 00:13:10.411\nBut we really need to just\ndefine the scope of the change,\n\n228\n00:13:10.411 --> 00:13:14.880\nexactly what is going to be changed,\nand what shouldn't be changed.\n\n229\n00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.260\nAnd that's important from\na configuration management perspective.\n\n230\n00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.410\nI need to understand,\nwhen I'm implementing a project,\n\n231\n00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:28.230\nI need to understand what my\nexpectations are in terms of scope.\n\n232\n00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.870\nIn terms of what hardware\nis going to be changed,\n\n233\n00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:35.920\nwhat software is going to be changed,\nand what is not going to be changed, and\n\n234\n00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.930\nwhat people are going to be affected.\n\n235\n00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:43.210\nThe last thing that our\nsupport team requires, or\n\n236\n00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.860\nthe last thing that our support\nteam wants, rather, not requires,\n\n237\n00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.610\nis to pick up a phone call or\nto pick up a phone from somebody\n\n238\n00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:57.210\nwho has absolutely nothing to do with\nthe change that went on over the weekend.\n\n239\n00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.750\nOnly to find out that it's impacted\nthem because now, all of a sudden,\n\n240\n00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.540\nthey can't get into their financial system\n\n241\n00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.870\nbecause somebody made a change to\nthe Windows Server environment.\n\n242\n00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:14.760\nSo we have to ensure that when we\nactually define the scope of the change,\n\n243\n00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.790\nthat we also sit down with\nconfiguration management and\n\n244\n00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:23.880\nwork out exactly what could be affected.\n\n245\n00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.890\nLook at the relationships\nbetween all of the components.\n\n246\n00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.620\nLook at all the relationships\nbetween all of our services, and\n\n247\n00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.090\nwork out exactly what that scope is,\nand what could be affected.\n\n248\n00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:37.920\nCuz that will also direct our testing,\nas well.\n\n249\n00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.413\nAnd then as part of the formulating\nchange, we begin the change communication.\n\n250\n00:14:43.771 --> 00:14:45.617\nAnd that means we talk to people.\n\n251\n00:14:45.617 --> 00:14:48.902\nThat means we tell them that\nsomething is coming up,\n\n252\n00:14:48.902 --> 00:14:53.690\nthat we're about to implement a change,\nthat we're going down this road.\n\n253\n00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:57.693\nAnd now is the time for your input.\n\n254\n00:14:57.693 --> 00:15:00.445\nI love what it says on the bottom\nright-hand corner, there.\n\n255\n00:15:00.445 --> 00:15:04.666\nAnd what it says on the bottom right-hand\ncorner is the fact that denial and\n\n256\n00:15:04.666 --> 00:15:08.040\nfear are two primary forms of resistance.\n\n257\n00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:08.550\nAnd they are.\n\n258\n00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.520\nIf you're frightened of a change,\nor you don't understand the change,\n\n259\n00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.870\nthen you're more likely to resist.\n\n260\n00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:20.190\nWhich is why we have to ensure\neffective communication.\n\n261\n00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:23.970\nAnd this is why I said to\nyou even if you're informed,\n\n262\n00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:27.498\nI've gotta give you the option\nto feed back to me.\n\n263\n00:15:27.498 --> 00:15:31.204\nRemember in a previous episode, we went\nthrough the emotional cycle of change.\n\n264\n00:15:31.204 --> 00:15:34.682\nAnd we looked at the fact that the first\nthing that people do is pretend it's not\n\n265\n00:15:34.682 --> 00:15:35.271\nhappening.\n\n266\n00:15:35.271 --> 00:15:39.903\nIf it's a major change, which it is, we're\ntalking at organizational level here.\n\n267\n00:15:39.903 --> 00:15:42.725\nIf it's a major change,\nthe first thing that happens is,\n\n268\n00:15:42.725 --> 00:15:44.300\nwell, I'm gonna ignore that.\n\n269\n00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.785\nAnd if I ignore it for long enough,\n[LAUGH] then it's gonna go away.\n\n270\n00:15:47.785 --> 00:15:50.563\nAnd that's exactly what we don't want.\n\n271\n00:15:50.563 --> 00:15:54.449\nWe want to be able to\ncommunicate the change.\n\n272\n00:15:54.449 --> 00:15:59.980\nAnd ensure that everybody is brought into\nthat, ensure that everybody is on board.\n\n273\n00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.181\nAnd that everybody feels\nheard because again,\n\n274\n00:16:03.181 --> 00:16:08.795\nif you don't feel heard then you're more\nlikely to become a source of resistance.\n\n275\n00:16:08.795 --> 00:16:12.323\nSo we've formulated the change,\n\n276\n00:16:12.323 --> 00:16:18.292\nthen we will define how we\nare going to perform the change.\n\n277\n00:16:18.292 --> 00:16:20.833\nAnd how we're gonna perform the change,\nis well,\n\n278\n00:16:20.833 --> 00:16:24.140\nis as you see the steps there\nin that top left-hand corner.\n\n279\n00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.270\nWe're gonna define\nthe approach first of all, and\n\n280\n00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:30.490\nthen we're going to plan\nour stakeholder engagement.\n\n281\n00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.350\nAnd then we're gonna plan the transition,\nso\n\n282\n00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:36.910\nwe've got to understand\nwhat the requirements are.\n\n283\n00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.430\nWe've got to define who our resources are,\nand\n\n284\n00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:45.100\nwhat budget we have,\nwhat our timeline is as well.\n\n285\n00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.670\nAnd then we've also got to define\n\n286\n00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.960\nhow we're going to measure\nwhether the changes are success.\n\n287\n00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:58.075\nAnd then, in our next episode we're gonna\ntake a look at risk management as well and\n\n288\n00:16:58.075 --> 00:16:59.070\nrisked changes.\n\n289\n00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.040\nBut let's just take a quick\nlook through this for a moment.\n\n290\n00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.999\nWe're going to collect our requirements,\nwell,\n\n291\n00:17:06.999 --> 00:17:10.036\nwe've already looked at in\nour previous slide there,\n\n292\n00:17:10.036 --> 00:17:14.542\nwe've looked at all of the things that we\nneed to do to involve our stakeholders.\n\n293\n00:17:14.542 --> 00:17:18.414\nAnd any single one of those stakeholders\ncould give us some additional\n\n294\n00:17:18.414 --> 00:17:21.770\nrequirements, over and\nabove the business requirements.\n\n295\n00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:25.050\nWhich is why we talk about\ncollecting those requirements,\n\n296\n00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.430\nthe one thing that we do not want to do,\n\n297\n00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:33.620\nis ignore any potential requirements\nthat may have come in as an addition.\n\n298\n00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.370\nCome in as feedback because Ronnie did\nactually come back to me with his opinion\n\n299\n00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:39.610\non something that I said to him.\n\n300\n00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:43.055\nAnd then once we have\nall of the feedback and\n\n301\n00:17:43.055 --> 00:17:48.796\nonce we have all of the stakeholder\nI was gonna say responsibilities but\n\n302\n00:17:48.796 --> 00:17:52.254\nit's more about the stakeholder inputs.\n\n303\n00:17:52.254 --> 00:17:56.860\nThen at that point in time, then what I'm\ngonna do is I'm gonna define the actual\n\n304\n00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:01.154\nphysical scope of the change including,\nexactly what has to happen when.\n\n305\n00:18:01.154 --> 00:18:07.138\nIt's at this point and time when I\nwant to see my project Gantt chart,\n\n306\n00:18:07.138 --> 00:18:11.059\nnow, we're in a project\nmanagement show and\n\n307\n00:18:11.059 --> 00:18:15.824\nso I'm hoping that you will\nknow what a Gantt chart is.\n\n308\n00:18:15.824 --> 00:18:18.991\nBut if you're really,\nreally unsure as to what a Gantt chart is,\n\n309\n00:18:18.991 --> 00:18:21.420\nwell a Gantt chart is\nsomething that we looked up.\n\n310\n00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:26.061\nLet me just go back here again and\nI will show you this, and\n\n311\n00:18:26.061 --> 00:18:29.261\nthis is actually a Gantt chart, okay?\n\n312\n00:18:29.261 --> 00:18:34.210\nNow, ordinarily to any project,\nthen this Gantt chart will\n\n313\n00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:38.591\nbe a series of activities\nincluding our milestones.\n\n314\n00:18:38.591 --> 00:18:43.488\nAnd our milestones are the things that we\nhave to achieve at certain points in time.\n\n315\n00:18:43.488 --> 00:18:47.930\nSo you'll see, we're moving from current\nstate to future state, that's a timeline.\n\n316\n00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.070\nAnd so what we're doing on that\nGantt chart is mapping out,\n\n317\n00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:56.490\nwhat needs to happen at certain\npoints during that timeline, and\n\n318\n00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:00.860\nwhat we also do is allocate the roles and\nresponsibilities.\n\n319\n00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:05.900\nAnd what we need to do from a project and\na program and a portfolio basis.\n\n320\n00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:10.758\nIs we need to ensure that we've got the\nright resources and the right skills to\n\n321\n00:19:10.758 --> 00:19:15.329\nbe able to perform each of those\nactivities available to us at that time.\n\n322\n00:19:15.329 --> 00:19:20.516\nSo I mentioned in previous episodes\nabout the fact that sometimes in\n\n323\n00:19:20.516 --> 00:19:26.522\nwithin projects we use what we may call\ntransient skills and transient teams.\n\n324\n00:19:26.522 --> 00:19:29.348\nIn other words, we'll bring in\ncontractors with specialist skills.\n\n325\n00:19:29.348 --> 00:19:34.220\nSo, we have to make sure that we\nhave got the right skills available\n\n326\n00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:38.055\nat the right time to us to\nperform those activities.\n\n327\n00:19:38.055 --> 00:19:41.150\nAnd that means we've got to ensure\nwe've got the right budget, too.\n\n328\n00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.776\nAnd the right budget may also\nmean buying in hardware and\n\n329\n00:19:44.776 --> 00:19:47.410\nsoftware as well as involving vendors.\n\n330\n00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.600\nAnd now we've got to define\nour success criteria,\n\n331\n00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.530\nit says measure or identify\nthe measures of benefits realization.\n\n332\n00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.220\nAnd we start off by defining\nour success criteria,\n\n333\n00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:04.460\nwhat is this change\nproject going to achieve?\n\n334\n00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.590\nAnd then the next question is,\nhow do we measure it?\n\n335\n00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.932\nSo we define the success criteria,\nwhatever that success criteria may be,\n\n336\n00:20:14.932 --> 00:20:15.688\nlet's say for\n\n337\n00:20:15.688 --> 00:20:19.469\ninstance that we are implementing\na new financial management system.\n\n338\n00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:22.468\nThat is our success criteria, okay so,\n\n339\n00:20:22.468 --> 00:20:26.889\nhow do I know whether we've\nimplemented it successfully?\n\n340\n00:20:26.889 --> 00:20:32.752\nThat's my benefits realization,\nhow do I understand that?\n\n341\n00:20:32.752 --> 00:20:35.429\nI could just say,\nwell look it's installed, there you go,\n\n342\n00:20:35.429 --> 00:20:36.690\nis it an icon on the desktop?\n\n343\n00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:40.160\nYes it is, right,\nwell then that's great, isn't it?\n\n344\n00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:45.152\nNo, it's about more than that surely,\nright, it's gotta work, but\n\n345\n00:20:45.152 --> 00:20:46.664\nwhat does work mean?\n\n346\n00:20:46.664 --> 00:20:48.869\nDoes work mean that it just has to load,\nor\n\n347\n00:20:48.869 --> 00:20:53.027\nif I say well it's gotta work well it's\ngotta load when you click on the icon and\n\n348\n00:20:53.027 --> 00:20:55.511\nthere it is it's on\nthe screen in front of you?\n\n349\n00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:57.839\nNo, no, we should have a set of,\n\n350\n00:20:57.839 --> 00:21:02.018\nwe've already mentioned\nCSFs Critical Success Factors.\n\n351\n00:21:02.018 --> 00:21:04.725\nAnd underneath those\ncritical success factors,\n\n352\n00:21:04.725 --> 00:21:08.474\nsee of course we're saying that\nthe first time really easy, right?\n\n353\n00:21:08.474 --> 00:21:12.906\nUnderneath those CFFs,\nwe'll stick to the acronym are KPIs,\n\n354\n00:21:12.906 --> 00:21:15.088\nkey performance indicators.\n\n355\n00:21:15.088 --> 00:21:20.076\nAnd I have to achieve certain levels\nwithin my KPIs to denote whether I have\n\n356\n00:21:20.076 --> 00:21:22.820\nachieved my critical success factors.\n\n357\n00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:31.600\nSo if my KPIs are such that maybe I\nhave to ensure that all invoices are,\n\n358\n00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.930\nsubmitted to the vendors within this\nnew financial management system,\n\n359\n00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:40.660\nall invoices are submitted to the vendors\nwithin ten days of being input.\n\n360\n00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:45.360\nAnd then,\nanother KPI may be that all reports\n\n361\n00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.530\nare produced within, I don't know,\nten minutes of being requested.\n\n362\n00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:54.742\nAnd so\nwe're gonna have a set of KPIs depending\n\n363\n00:21:54.742 --> 00:21:58.738\non what it is that service\nis supposed to do.\n\n364\n00:21:58.738 --> 00:22:03.355\nAnd financial management could be anything\nit could be making sure that we pay\n\n365\n00:22:03.355 --> 00:22:05.352\neverybody on time for instance.\n\n366\n00:22:05.352 --> 00:22:11.990\nYour KPIs will tell you whether you\nare achieving success of any change.\n\n367\n00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:17.730\nBut remember what I said in a previous\nepisode, you don't just measure your KPIs,\n\n368\n00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:23.065\nyour benefits realization the minute\nthat you have implemented something.\n\n369\n00:22:23.065 --> 00:22:27.582\nCuz that's really not gonna tell you all\nthat much, and the first sort of day or\n\n370\n00:22:27.582 --> 00:22:32.600\ntwo that you implement something, it's not\ngonna get used, to be perfectly honest.\n\n371\n00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.326\nIt's just gonna cause more negative\nimpact than positive impact immediately.\n\n372\n00:22:37.326 --> 00:22:43.146\nAnd so, you've got to ensure that yes,\nyou've measured implementation but\n\n373\n00:22:43.146 --> 00:22:46.586\nyou measure your KPIs at\nregular intervals for\n\n374\n00:22:46.586 --> 00:22:50.553\na set period of time,\nbefore you can then demonstrate\n\n375\n00:22:50.553 --> 00:22:55.257\nthat a change has actually achieved\nwhat it set out to achieve.\n\n376\n00:22:57.405 --> 00:23:00.870\nSo here we're planing our\napproach to implement\n\n377\n00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:05.611\nin the change then we've got to\nplan what we're going to measure.\n\n378\n00:23:05.611 --> 00:23:08.877\nWe need to know what we're\nsupposed to be achieving and\n\n379\n00:23:08.877 --> 00:23:11.008\nwhat we are setting out to achieve.\n\n380\n00:23:11.008 --> 00:23:14.359\nAnd we need to know how it's going\nto be measured and we need to\n\n381\n00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:18.462\nknow that right now because this is\nhow we build that particular service.\n\n382\n00:23:18.462 --> 00:23:22.971\nWe will build it so that it can\ndeliver our report within ten minutes,\n\n383\n00:23:22.971 --> 00:23:24.779\nif that's one of our KPIs.\n\n384\n00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:28.839\nWe will deliver it so that it can\nproduce an invoice within ten days,\n\n385\n00:23:28.839 --> 00:23:30.850\nif that's one of the KPIs.\n\n386\n00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:35.940\nWe'll deliver it so that it can pay people\non time, if that's one of the KPIs.\n\n387\n00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:42.860\nWe're not going to deliver an additional\nfunctionality that's not part of the KPIs,\n\n388\n00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.459\nand therefore is not part of\nthe benefits realization.\n\n389\n00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:51.057\nSo this is where we set all of this out,\nand\n\n390\n00:23:51.057 --> 00:23:59.464\nthen what we're also going to do is we're\ngoing to perform some risk management.\n\n391\n00:23:59.464 --> 00:24:03.148\nNow, I'm not gonna look at risk\nmanagement right now, okay,\n\n392\n00:24:03.148 --> 00:24:07.737\nwhat I'm going to do is we're gonna\ncome back again, and in another episode,\n\n393\n00:24:07.737 --> 00:24:12.500\nour next episode, we're going to look\nspecifically at risk management.\n\n394\n00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.930\nAnd then at actually closing\nthe change after we have implemented.\n\n395\n00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:19.190\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, thank you for\n\n396\n00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:22.830\nhelping us once again and taking a look\nat this idea of performing the change.\n\n397\n00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:26.650\nLot of times, it's very easy to think that\nit's gonna be something that we don't have\n\n398\n00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:30.060\nto think about, but\nputting this to at least in our mind.\n\n399\n00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:33.123\nGetting everything set up for\nunderstanding that we have to plan,\n\n400\n00:24:33.123 --> 00:24:35.155\nformulate, do everything that we need to.\n\n401\n00:24:35.155 --> 00:24:37.928\nTo prepare for this because there\nare many different resistances and\n\n402\n00:24:37.928 --> 00:24:39.490\nfactors that are out there.\n\n403\n00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:40.930\nIs really gonna be key and\n\n404\n00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.700\nnow we also have to take a look at\nthe idea of risk that are involved too.\n\n405\n00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:48.043\nBut that is for another episode then,\nsigning off for ITProTV,\n\n406\n00:24:48.043 --> 00:24:51.022\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n407\n00:24:51.022 --> 00:24:52.039\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\n\n408\n00:24:52.039 --> 00:24:54.175\nmore

Absolutely great, thank you.\n\n13\n00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.170\nRonnie, how are you?\n\n14\n00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.450\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine, Jo.\n\n15\n00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.940\nVery interested, now that we're halfway\nthrough this idea of performing\n\n16\n00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.490\nthe change, interesting to talk about and\nto discuss a little bit about the idea of\n\n17\n00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.300\nwhat we have to actually\nkind of have to end with.\n\n18\n00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.590\nWhich a little bit is risks, I think,\nis what we're taking a look at.\n\n19\n00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.680\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's it.\n\n20\n00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.260\nIn our last episode, we looked at\nactually doing the change itself.\n\n21\n00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.290\nAnd we were defining the change\napproach during our last episode.\n\n22\n00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.200\nAnd we took a look at managing or\ncollecting our requirements for our change\n\n23\n00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.260\nand then sequencing the change or\nactually coming up with our Gantt chart.\n\n24\n00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.010\nAnd making sure that we've got the right\nresources and the right money and also all\n\n25\n00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.010\nof the relevant skills and also the right\ntimeline, as well, for the change.\n\n26\n00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.540\nAnd then we looked at defining\nthe benefits realization.\n\n27\n00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.770\nSo making sure that we have those critical\nsuccess factors and the KPI's defined.\n\n28\n00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.770\nAnd where we left off was actually at\nthe bottom of this particular screen,\n\n29\n00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.710\nand the bottom there.\n\n30\n00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.840\nWell, clarifying risks to change,\nacceptance, adoption, and realization.\n\n31\n00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.490\nThis is about risk management.\n\n32\n00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.170\nThis is about identifying risk,\nand you know what?\n\n33\n00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.820\nI actually wanted to leave this one\nto this particular episode because I\n\n34\n00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.910\nreally wanted to spend some time on this.\n\n35\n00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.920\nLet's take a look at this.\n\n36\n00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.940\nRisks are classified into, as it says\nhere, seven different categories.\n\n37\n00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.610\nA risk is something that could\naffect the success of any change.\n\n38\n00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.700\nWe talk about people, cultural risks,\n\n39\n00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.825\ncapability risks, development,\nprocess development,\n\n40\n00:02:13.825 --> 00:02:19.290\norganizational, structural and management\nrisks, time and environmental risks.\n\n41\n00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.000\nDon't forget that we are talking here\nabout organizational change management.\n\n42\n00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.060\nSo we're talking about\ntransformational change.\n\n43\n00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.960\nAnd you will see that if we could just\ntake a quick look back at those particular\n\n44\n00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.985\ncategories, you will see that a lot\nof these are to do with people.\n\n45\n00:02:35.985 --> 00:02:37.995\nYou're talking about culture.\n\n46\n00:02:37.995 --> 00:02:42.225\nYou're talking about their capabilities,\nnot just technical capabilities.\n\n47\n00:02:42.225 --> 00:02:46.165\nYou're talking about organizational\nstructure or management.\n\n48\n00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:49.485\nYou're talking about\nenvironmental risks as well.\n\n49\n00:02:49.485 --> 00:02:53.575\nSo all of these are to do with\nthe things that people influence.\n\n50\n00:02:53.575 --> 00:03:01.130\nNow I know that when we looked at\nplanning the change in previous episodes,\n\n51\n00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.120\nwe talked about the fact that to\norganizational change management.\n\n52\n00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.890\nOrganizational change management,\n\n53\n00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.680\nit really is, well,\nit's focused around the people.\n\n54\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.700\nAnd people can either break a change,\nthey can stop something from happening,\n\n55\n00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.290\nor they can be the drivers to the success\nof any organizational change.\n\n56\n00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.400\nAnd that's exactly the same when\nit comes to risk management,\n\n57\n00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.290\nis that people are your biggest risk.\n\n58\n00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.990\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n59\n00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.860\n&gt;&gt; And I know I'm gonna say it again,\nbut all it takes is one person.\n\n60\n00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.930\nOne person, one negative person,\n\n61\n00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.160\nto undermine the success of\na transformational project.\n\n62\n00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.610\nCuz all it takes is one person and\na lot of rumors.\n\n63\n00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.470\nSo how do we, then, clarify risk,\nhow do we identify risk?\n\n64\n00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.100\nAnd then, how do we plan to,\nwell, do something with the risk?\n\n65\n00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.210\nAnd what could we do with the risk?\n\n66\n00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.920\nHow do you think we identify risk?\n\n67\n00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.970\n&gt;&gt; How to identify risks?\n\n68\n00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.045\nWe do surveys.\n\n69\n00:04:01.045 --> 00:04:02.147\n[LAUGH] I don't know.\n\n70\n00:04:02.147 --> 00:04:04.355\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Can't say.\n\n71\n00:04:04.355 --> 00:04:07.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, we'll do a survey.\n\n72\n00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.675\nHow's that?\n\n73\n00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:10.385\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah alright then, yeah.\n\n74\n00:04:10.385 --> 00:04:12.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I kind of think that might work.\n\n75\n00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.485\nYes, okay.\n\n76\n00:04:14.485 --> 00:04:16.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Alright,\n\n77\n00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.222\nlet's go on with this one then.\n\n78\n00:04:18.222 --> 00:04:21.510\n&gt;&gt; There we go, okay. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I'm\nnot going to leave you alone with this.\n\n79\n00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.110\nYou're not getting off that lightly.\n\n80\n00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.230\nLet's carry on with this.\n\n81\n00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.790\nSo we're going to do a survey.\n\n82\n00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.290\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n83\n00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.320\n&gt;&gt; When was the last time\nyou got sent a survey?\n\n84\n00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.350\n&gt;&gt; Not too long ago,\nprobably about a week ago.\n\n85\n00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.380\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and what was it for,\nif you don't mind me asking?\n\n86\n00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.690\n&gt;&gt; Let's see,\nthe survey was about purchases,\n\n87\n00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.310\nor what type of purchase I would\nlike to make in the next six months.\n\n88\n00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.790\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and how honest were\nyou at filling out that survey?\n\n89\n00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.360\n&gt;&gt; I was very honest.\n\n90\n00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.650\n&gt;&gt; You were incredibly honest.\n\n91\n00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.270\n&gt;&gt; I was.\n\n92\n00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.280\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n93\n00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.770\nAnd was this a survey that\nyou wanted to fill out or\n\n94\n00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.150\nwas this a survey that you\nwere just sent at random?\n\n95\n00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.090\n&gt;&gt; No, I wanted to fill this one out, and\n\n96\n00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.830\nthat's because it was actually something\nthat happened on Google Rewards.\n\n97\n00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.240\nSo I was able to get compensated for\nmy survey.\n\n98\n00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.580\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n99\n00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.380\nOkay, then.\n\n100\n00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.120\nSo Ronnie was being compensated for this.\n\n101\n00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.535\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI think I got $0.10 in Google Play.\n\n102\n00:05:21.535 --> 00:05:24.733\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wow some people are cheap.\n\n103\n00:05:24.733 --> 00:05:25.420\n&gt;&gt; No doubt.\n\n104\n00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.518\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm gonna\nput out there right?\n\n105\n00:05:27.518 --> 00:05:29.566\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but Ronnie,\n\n106\n00:05:29.566 --> 00:05:32.330\nyou know that there's\nan issue with surveys, right?\n\n107\n00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.210\nAnd that issue is that there's only\nabout 40% of surveys that actually\n\n108\n00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.078\nget filled out.\n\n109\n00:05:38.078 --> 00:05:38.670\nAn in fact,\n\n110\n00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.650\nactually you're really lucky if you\nget a 40% return on a customer survey.\n\n111\n00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.980\nSo let's look at something else then.\n\n112\n00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.440\nAnd I know I'm gonna dread asking this.\n\n113\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.321\nWhen was the last time you went\nout to a restaurant Ronnie?\n\n114\n00:05:52.321 --> 00:05:56.236\n&gt;&gt; About a week ago I went out,\nwhen I was on vacation.\n\n115\n00:05:56.236 --> 00:06:00.210\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\nI'm assuming that the waitress came up and\n\n116\n00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.450\nasked you if everything was\nall right with your meal?\n\n117\n00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.670\n&gt;&gt; The waitress did come up and\n\n118\n00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.350\nask me if there was something\nall right with my meal.\n\n119\n00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.350\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna like\nthe answer to this am I?\n\n120\n00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.640\nI'm really, I'm not.\n\n121\n00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.510\nAnd did you, what did you tell her Ronnie?\n\n122\n00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.225\n&gt;&gt; I told her my steak was rubbery.\n\n123\n00:06:13.225 --> 00:06:15.070\n[LAUGH] I did complain.\n\n124\n00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.965\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\n\n125\n00:06:15.965 --> 00:06:16.543\n&gt;&gt; I complained, yes.\n\n126\n00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:18.045\n&gt;&gt; Yep, as I thought, yes.\n\n127\n00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:20.172\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You are the anomaly.\n\n128\n00:06:20.172 --> 00:06:23.290\n[LAUGH] It's true, it's true.\n\n129\n00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.800\nAnd actually, it is true, and\nthe reason why I wanna mention that,\n\n130\n00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.620\ncuz most people when go out to a\nrestaurant, the waitress would come up and\n\n131\n00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.080\nask if everything's okay with your meal.\n\n132\n00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.350\nAnd most people, unless you're Ronnie,\nwill actually say, yeah,\n\n133\n00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.040\neverything's fine, and\nthen the waitress will just carry on.\n\n134\n00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.734\nAnd what will happen is you will just\nnot go back to that restaurant again.\n\n135\n00:06:44.734 --> 00:06:46.390\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n136\n00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.180\n&gt;&gt; Simple as that.\n\n137\n00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.230\n&gt;&gt; I've done that before.\n\n138\n00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.880\n&gt;&gt; Right, so let's think about\nhow valuable surveys are.\n\n139\n00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.150\nAnd I'm not going to try and\ndismiss surveys at all,\n\n140\n00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.040\nbecause they do have their place.\n\n141\n00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.970\nAs long as you can get\na good return on them and\n\n142\n00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.650\nas long as you've got\npeople that are honest.\n\n143\n00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.550\nBut for the most part, people are just\ngoing to tell you exactly what they think.\n\n144\n00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.360\nEven when you're in a one to one\nsituation like we are right now.\n\n145\n00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.630\nWhen you're in a one to one situation and\nyou're talking to somebody,\n\n146\n00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.075\nI could ask you a question that\nyou might feel uncomfortable with.\n\n147\n00:07:15.075 --> 00:07:17.287\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And you might not give me the truth.\n\n148\n00:07:17.287 --> 00:07:18.713\n&gt;&gt; It's possible.\n\n149\n00:07:18.713 --> 00:07:21.986\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not likely though.\n\n150\n00:07:21.986 --> 00:07:23.056\n&gt;&gt; Not likely.\n\n151\n00:07:23.056 --> 00:07:25.390\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no,\nI'm gonna find the truth out from Ronnie.\n\n152\n00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.430\nBut this is because when it comes to\nquestions, when it comes to surveys,\n\n153\n00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:36.860\nwhen it comes to interviews, people\nwill say what they want you to hear.\n\n154\n00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.800\nBecause people will generally take\nthe path of sort of least confrontation.\n\n155\n00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.750\nAnd so when it comes to just taking\na survey as a means of identifying\n\n156\n00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.940\nrisks with people,\nthe survey's not gonna be good enough.\n\n157\n00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.630\nWhere do you think I find out the truth?\n\n158\n00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.570\nRight, okay let me ask you, I'm gonna\nask you something that I normally\n\n159\n00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.155\nI don't know whether I wanna do this.\n\n160\n00:07:56.155 --> 00:08:00.076\n[LAUGH] Let me ask you something that I\nwould normally ask somebody in a class.\n\n161\n00:08:00.076 --> 00:08:02.628\nI would normally say to them,\njust to prove a point,\n\n162\n00:08:02.628 --> 00:08:05.305\nI would normally say Are you\nenjoying the class so far?\n\n163\n00:08:05.305 --> 00:08:08.320\nSo are you enjoying this episode so\nfar, Ronnie?\n\n164\n00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:08.820\n&gt;&gt; I am.\n\n165\n00:08:10.514 --> 00:08:11.756\n&gt;&gt; Are you lying to me?\n\n166\n00:08:11.756 --> 00:08:13.440\n&gt;&gt; I am not lying to you.\n\n167\n00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:13.940\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n168\n00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.150\nCan I ask this?\n\n169\n00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.430\nNormally, if we're in a classroom,\n\n170\n00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.680\nI would ask exactly the same situation\nbecause I would wanna prove a point.\n\n171\n00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.640\nBecause no matter what I ask, if I'm\ndirect and I'm confrontational like that,\n\n172\n00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.810\nif I'm really direct,\nthen it kinda puts you on edge,\n\n173\n00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:35.330\nand the only thing that you're ever going\nto say to me is, yeah, yeah, it's great.\n\n174\n00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.480\nSo where am I actually gonna find\nout the truth, do you think?\n\n175\n00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:43.020\n&gt;&gt; In whether or\nnot they adopt the change?\n\n176\n00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:43.560\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n177\n00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay, then I don't know.\n\n178\n00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.390\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about identifying risk.\n\n179\n00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:50.323\nSo I've asked the question about whether\nyou're enjoying this episode so far.\n\n180\n00:08:50.323 --> 00:08:52.830\nSo where am I gonna find out the truth?\n\n181\n00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.890\n&gt;&gt; At the end of the episode?\n\n182\n00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:56.945\nYou've got me now.\n\n183\n00:08:56.945 --> 00:08:59.573\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna find out the truth by\n\n184\n00:08:59.573 --> 00:09:04.491\nlistening to conversations, in say,\nthe kitchens or the break rooms,\n\n185\n00:09:04.491 --> 00:09:06.740\nor next to the water cooler.\n\n186\n00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.520\nThat's where I'm gonna find out the truth.\n\n187\n00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.535\nSo if we want to perform risk mitigation,\nif we want to\n\n188\n00:09:13.535 --> 00:09:18.320\nidentify risk,\nwe can't just send out a server.\n\n189\n00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.580\nBecause we're not gonna get the truth.\n\n190\n00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.770\nWe're not gonna get how\npeople really feel.\n\n191\n00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:27.040\nSo we're not gonna necessarily be able\nto identify resistance from that.\n\n192\n00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.150\nWhat we're gonna have to do is, we're\ngonna have to find out from people that\n\n193\n00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:35.730\ntrust us and\npeople that are in with those teams,\n\n194\n00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.440\nthose stakeholders, and\nthat customer environment potentially,\n\n195\n00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.040\nif we're talking about delivering\na product to the customers.\n\n196\n00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.984\n&gt;&gt; Now, Jo, in your experience,\nhave you seen the same like, let's say,\n\n197\n00:09:46.984 --> 00:09:48.420\nwith anonymous surveys by chance?\n\n198\n00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.726\n&gt;&gt; The problem with\nanonymous surveys is that,\n\n199\n00:09:51.726 --> 00:09:54.371\nyou generally get the truth\nwith an anonymous survey.\n\n200\n00:09:54.371 --> 00:09:55.858\nThat's easy to say, wasn't it?\n\n201\n00:09:55.858 --> 00:09:57.877\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You generally get the truth\n\n202\n00:09:57.877 --> 00:10:00.945\nwith that, but you still don't get\nthe uptake on the anonymous survey.\n\n203\n00:10:00.945 --> 00:10:01.583\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n204\n00:10:01.583 --> 00:10:06.070\n&gt;&gt; Now, what you mentioned earlier about\nbeing incentivized to do something.\n\n205\n00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.850\nI mean,\n$0.10 is not really an incentive for me.\n\n206\n00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:13.990\nBut being incentivized to do something\nwill actually help with the uptake.\n\n207\n00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.910\nBut again, like I said,\n\n208\n00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:19.300\nI mean 40% of the survey response\nis actually a really good response.\n\n209\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.708\nAnd if you've only got\na response from 40% of people,\n\n210\n00:10:21.708 --> 00:10:24.432\nthen you still don't even know\nwhat the majority are thinking.\n\n211\n00:10:24.432 --> 00:10:30.945\nSo surveys could identify some risks,\nbut it's very unlikely to.\n\n212\n00:10:30.945 --> 00:10:31.606\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n213\n00:10:31.606 --> 00:10:35.368\n&gt;&gt; So the way that we will identify\nrisks is actually by getting out with\n\n214\n00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:40.319\nthe stakeholders and observing, seeing\nwhat's happening, seeing what's going on,\n\n215\n00:10:40.319 --> 00:10:44.016\nobserving interactions,\nobserving their ways of doing things,\n\n216\n00:10:44.016 --> 00:10:46.330\nobserving their ways of working.\n\n217\n00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.240\nAnd that's one of the best ways\nof identifying risks in cultures,\n\n218\n00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.870\nidentifying the risks with people, etc.\n\n219\n00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.770\nBut then, once we've identified all\nof these risks, then we'll use,\n\n220\n00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.270\nwhen it comes to capabilities of people,\nwe'll use team managers,\n\n221\n00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:07.270\nteam leaders to identify the skills, and\nthings like skills matrices for instance.\n\n222\n00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.850\nBut once we've identified,\nthen we've got to do something with them.\n\n223\n00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.223\nAnd we call that risk management.\n\n224\n00:11:12.223 --> 00:11:15.980\nThere are four things that\nwe can do with a risk.\n\n225\n00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:21.510\nWe can mitigate against it,\nwe can accept it,\n\n226\n00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.850\nand potentially,\nmitigate against the effects of the risk.\n\n227\n00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.169\nWe can share it or\nwe can transfer it to somebody else.\n\n228\n00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.730\nSo I just wanna go over these very,\nvery quickly.\n\n229\n00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.260\nJust very, very briefly.\n\n230\n00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.580\nWe can mitigate against a risk happening.\n\n231\n00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:41.380\nIn other words, we can try and\nprevent something from happening.\n\n232\n00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:47.015\nSo we can try and let's say, if we\nwere constructing an office building,\n\n233\n00:11:47.015 --> 00:11:51.025\nwe would try and prevent fires by\nmaking sure that there weren't\n\n234\n00:11:51.025 --> 00:11:55.065\nany exposed electrical near to\nany plumbing, for instance.\n\n235\n00:11:56.075 --> 00:11:58.140\nThat's mitigation.\n\n236\n00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.040\nThen there's also acceptance of risk.\n\n237\n00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.830\nAnd acceptance of risk is generally based\non the likelihood of the risk happening.\n\n238\n00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:07.590\nWe could just say, okay, we know that's\ngoing to happen or it could happen, and\n\n239\n00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:12.000\nwe'll just accept it if it does\nbecause the likelihood is really low.\n\n240\n00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.880\nOr we could accept it and we could\nmitigate against the effects of the risk.\n\n241\n00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.180\nSo again, in the instance of,\nif we're constructing a building,\n\n242\n00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:25.900\nwe might put in sprinkler systems or we\nmight put in fire doors to isolate fires.\n\n243\n00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.680\nSo we're mitigating against\nthe effects of the risk.\n\n244\n00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:33.850\nWe could share the risk with somebody\nelse, maybe a third party supplier.\n\n245\n00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.060\nOr we could transfer\nthe responsibility of that risk\n\n246\n00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.990\nto somebody completely in its entirety.\n\n247\n00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.670\nNow again, that's not gonna get\nrid of the risk, unfortunately,\n\n248\n00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.800\nthat's just giving it to\nsomebody else to deal with.\n\n249\n00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:51.320\nBut we have to ensure that,\nbefore we embark on any project and\n\n250\n00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:58.275\nbefore we embark on any change, we have\ngot to identify the risks to that change.\n\n251\n00:12:58.275 --> 00:13:03.370\nWe've got to identify the risk\nto the success of that project.\n\n252\n00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:08.586\nAnd then moving on from risk management,\nthen what we do after we've planned\n\n253\n00:13:08.586 --> 00:13:13.803\nthe change, well, we then plan how\nwe're going to transition and how we're\n\n254\n00:13:13.803 --> 00:13:18.646\ngoing to integrate that particular\nchange into the live environment.\n\n255\n00:13:18.646 --> 00:13:24.060\nAnd the sort of things that we might\nwant to consider and baring in mind,\n\n256\n00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.900\nthat this is all going\nto be project-specific.\n\n257\n00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.040\nIt's going to be changed-specific.\n\n258\n00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.770\nSo we can't get into too much detail here.\n\n259\n00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:37.910\nBut the sort of things that we might want\nto consider, is the size of the change.\n\n260\n00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.650\nIn other words, who is it going to affect?\n\n261\n00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:44.290\nWe've already looked at when we planned\nout our change, we looked at the scope.\n\n262\n00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:49.740\nAnd so, this is where we plan\nto implement based on the scope,\n\n263\n00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.640\nbased on the size of the transition.\n\n264\n00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.010\nAnd we might think about\nwhether we want to do this in,\n\n265\n00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:58.190\nwe're talking about\norganizational change management.\n\n266\n00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.610\nBut there's no reason why we\ncouldn't do this in an agile way.\n\n267\n00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.730\nIt doesn't have to be done\nin a waterfall approach.\n\n268\n00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:10.010\nSo in an agile way, we could\nimplement incremental changes, and\n\n269\n00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:13.860\nthat would ease the impact potentially,\n\n270\n00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:18.840\nease the negative impact and\nalso even out the positive impact too.\n\n271\n00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.459\nBut again, that's dependent on\nthe size of the transition itself.\n\n272\n00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.070\nAnd think about how we would\ntransition any skills.\n\n273\n00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:30.750\nWith any new change, there's going to\nbe some new skills that are required,\n\n274\n00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:35.180\nboth on behalf of the user and\nalso the support personnel as well.\n\n275\n00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:40.760\nSo how do we then transition\nall of those capabilities?\n\n276\n00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:45.290\nAnd what about transition of\nthe management of this new service, or\n\n277\n00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:46.980\nthis new capability?\n\n278\n00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.820\nBecause it started off as a project, but\nnow we actually want to pass it over\n\n279\n00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:55.990\nto the support teams, and\nto the support environments.\n\n280\n00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.116\nAnd all of these is got to be planned.\n\n281\n00:14:58.116 --> 00:15:02.880\nThe first word on that title\nup there is the word plan.\n\n282\n00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.730\nIt's about planning that transition.\n\n283\n00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.640\nThis is not, when we're doing it,\n\n284\n00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.520\nbut this is what when we're\nplanning what we're going to do.\n\n285\n00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.780\nAnd then, what we do then,\nis we then implement it.\n\n286\n00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:21.930\nSo as part of the implementation, we\nprepare the organization for that change.\n\n287\n00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.044\nSo this is where we carry out our plan,\n\n288\n00:15:26.044 --> 00:15:31.199\nthis is where we ensure that we\ncarry out all of our communication,\n\n289\n00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:35.639\nmaking sure that we train everybody and\nwe prepare them.\n\n290\n00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:39.620\nAnd then, we mobilize our stakeholders.\n\n291\n00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.170\nIn other words,\nwe pull our stakeholders together and\n\n292\n00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.405\nwe ensure that they\nunderstand the timeline,\n\n293\n00:15:44.405 --> 00:15:48.730\nwe ensure that they understand what\nactivities they have to undertake.\n\n294\n00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:53.020\nAnd we ensure that everybody has\nthe right skills to be able to\n\n295\n00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.890\nundertake their activities.\n\n296\n00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:00.772\nAnd now, we're gonna jump, because now\nwe're gonna deliver the project output.\n\n297\n00:16:00.772 --> 00:16:04.520\nSo now, we've gone from getting everybody\ntogether to, here it is, it's ready.\n\n298\n00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:08.491\nAnd so we deliver those project outputs.\n\n299\n00:16:08.491 --> 00:16:11.257\nBut as we're delivering the outputs,\nremember,\n\n300\n00:16:11.257 --> 00:16:13.001\nwe wanna do this in an agile way.\n\n301\n00:16:13.001 --> 00:16:17.913\nWe want to do this in an incremental\nway because we have our Gantt chart\n\n302\n00:16:17.913 --> 00:16:22.245\nthat shows when each particular\ndeliverable is due, okay?\n\n303\n00:16:22.245 --> 00:16:26.541\nSo we're delivering in an incremental\nway each individual activity.\n\n304\n00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:31.636\nEven in a standard waterfall approach\nwhere we are not delivering the end\n\n305\n00:16:31.636 --> 00:16:37.150\nresults until right at the very end,\nwe're still performing each activity in\n\n306\n00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:42.603\nan incremental way because different\npeople are performing each activity.\n\n307\n00:16:42.603 --> 00:16:46.048\nEven though the end result is not\ndelivered until the very end of\n\n308\n00:16:46.048 --> 00:16:46.830\nthe project.\n\n309\n00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:51.200\nIn an agile approach then,\nas we have a group of activities that have\n\n310\n00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.360\nbeen completed,\nthen we deliver incrementally.\n\n311\n00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.579\nBut with the waterfall approach,\nwe deliver at the end of the project.\n\n312\n00:16:57.579 --> 00:17:01.972\nBut nevertheless, the activities\nare still performed incrementally\n\n313\n00:17:01.972 --> 00:17:06.320\nbecause there will be\ndependencies on those activities.\n\n314\n00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.940\nAnd then we transition those\noutputs then into the organization.\n\n315\n00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:16.420\nAnd again, we have to ensure that\nwe transition the skills needed to\n\n316\n00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:21.940\nbe able to deliver the change,\nto be able to then use the new service,\n\n317\n00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.940\nto be able to, well,\nadopt the new ways of working.\n\n318\n00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.620\nAnd then, of course,\nwe have to do the benefits realization.\n\n319\n00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:35.970\nWe have to ensure that we understand\nwhether this project has been\n\n320\n00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:42.220\nreceived and whether the change has\nbeen adopted by the organization.\n\n321\n00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.910\nAnd so that means our CSS and\n\n322\n00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:47.210\nour KPIs that we talked about\nin our previous episode.\n\n323\n00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:52.158\nAnd then, of course, what we have to do is\nmake sure that if we didn't get it right,\n\n324\n00:17:52.158 --> 00:17:54.370\nwe're gonna do something about it.\n\n325\n00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:57.633\nAnd that's addressing those discrepancies.\n\n326\n00:17:57.633 --> 00:18:04.369\nAnd now what I wanna concentrate\non is then embedding the change.\n\n327\n00:18:04.369 --> 00:18:10.047\nSo that's making sure that everybody is\nnot just aware of the new way of working,\n\n328\n00:18:10.047 --> 00:18:14.800\nbut that they carry on of being\naware of that new way of working.\n\n329\n00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.648\nAnd that they actually, well,\nengage and take ownership of the new\n\n330\n00:18:19.648 --> 00:18:24.002\nway of working as well because\nthat is now business as usual.\n\n331\n00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:27.152\nWe've transitioned from business as usual,\n\n332\n00:18:27.152 --> 00:18:30.307\nthe old business as usual,\nthrough a change.\n\n333\n00:18:30.307 --> 00:18:33.038\nAnd we're now in business as usual again,\nbut\n\n334\n00:18:33.038 --> 00:18:36.390\nit just happens to be\na different business as usual.\n\n335\n00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:40.230\nSo think about that emotional cycle of\nchange that we talked about in previous\n\n336\n00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.290\nepisodes.\n\n337\n00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:45.194\nAnd think about also,\nwe looked at that Gartner Hype cycle, and\n\n338\n00:18:45.194 --> 00:18:49.547\nthat in peak of inflated expectation\nget the expectation set in right.\n\n339\n00:18:49.547 --> 00:18:54.714\nAnd then that transition into the new\nbusiness as usual will be a lot easier.\n\n340\n00:18:54.714 --> 00:18:57.044\nAnd then as I’ve already said,\n\n341\n00:18:57.044 --> 00:19:02.410\nthen we measure the benefits on\nan ongoing basis, on an iterative basis.\n\n342\n00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:08.662\nNow in terms of delivering\norganizational change,\n\n343\n00:19:08.662 --> 00:19:15.369\nthis is not going to be something that\nis done within two months, three months.\n\n344\n00:19:15.369 --> 00:19:20.045\nAn organizational change is\ngenerally something that happens\n\n345\n00:19:20.045 --> 00:19:25.150\nwell over a period of maybe six months,\nmaybe more than that.\n\n346\n00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:29.146\nAnd you will have to make your decision\nwithin your organization as to whether\n\n347\n00:19:29.146 --> 00:19:31.609\nyou want to deliver this\nchange in an agile way.\n\n348\n00:19:31.609 --> 00:19:35.338\nIn other words, incrementally\nwith incremental small changes.\n\n349\n00:19:35.338 --> 00:19:40.266\nOr whether you want to deliver\nthe change in a waterfall approach,\n\n350\n00:19:40.266 --> 00:19:44.580\nand you want to wait until you\nhave everything available.\n\n351\n00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.196\nAnd you want to wait until you have\nthe full package before you then deliver\n\n352\n00:19:48.196 --> 00:19:49.956\nthe change into the organization.\n\n353\n00:19:49.956 --> 00:19:52.630\nYou know your organization.\n\n354\n00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.801\nNow I don't, and I can't give you\na recommendation right now for\n\n355\n00:19:55.801 --> 00:19:56.849\nyour organization.\n\n356\n00:19:56.849 --> 00:19:59.885\nWhat I can tell you is, though,\nthat if you do have any questions, and\n\n357\n00:19:59.885 --> 00:20:03.305\nyou've got any queries about this,\nthen I'll be more than happy to help you.\n\n358\n00:20:03.305 --> 00:20:08.774\nJust log on to our website and\nput something into the Q&amp;A section.\n\n359\n00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:13.819\nAnd it will come back to me,\nand I will be able to help.\n\n360\n00:20:13.819 --> 00:20:17.410\nBut only you know your organization and\nonly you know what's right for\n\n361\n00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:18.610\nyour organization.\n\n362\n00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:23.220\nOne thing that I do want to leave\nyou with before we sign off for\n\n363\n00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.950\nthis particular episode is the fact\nthat people are the most important\n\n364\n00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.440\nthing to any organizational change.\n\n365\n00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.510\nYou don't want to have resistance\nwhether it's active resistance or\n\n366\n00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.170\nwhether it's passive resistance.\n\n367\n00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.979\nYou don't want resistance to any change.\n\n368\n00:20:39.979 --> 00:20:44.911\nSo good organizational change management\nis going to be key to the success of\n\n369\n00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:48.235\nany change in any project\nthat you want to deliver.\n\n370\n00:20:48.235 --> 00:20:49.977\nBecause without that,\n\n371\n00:20:49.977 --> 00:20:54.947\nthen unfortunately you're going\nto have some form of resistance.\n\n372\n00:20:54.947 --> 00:20:59.953\nAnd with that resistance, well,\nthat takes your chance of success.\n\n373\n00:20:59.953 --> 00:21:07.170\nAnd complete sustenance of that new\nway of working, well, it reduces it.\n\n374\n00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.500\nAnd that's the last thing that we want.\n\n375\n00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.582\nWhat we actually want to do is\nultimately deliver successful change.\n\n376\n00:21:12.582 --> 00:21:14.224\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well,\nthank you again for\n\n377\n00:21:14.224 --> 00:21:17.572\nhelping us understand the entire process\nhere on organizational change management.\n\n378\n00:21:17.572 --> 00:21:20.466\nThere's plenty of material right here for\nyou to go over,\n\n379\n00:21:20.466 --> 00:21:24.600\nnot only as you prepare for some exam, but\nalso if you're considering the idea of,\n\n380\n00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.872\nwell, these transformational changes for\nyour organization.\n\n381\n00:21:27.872 --> 00:21:32.243\nBut that's gonna do it for this entire\nseries then, so let's go ahead and\n\n382\n00:21:32.243 --> 00:21:32.888\nsign off.\n\n383\n00:21:32.888 --> 00:21:35.744\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host Ronnie
