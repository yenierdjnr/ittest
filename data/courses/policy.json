00:00:19.004\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and in today's\nepisode we're gonna be talking about\n\n4\n00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:22.880\nworking with group policy, and\nmore specifically what is group policy and\n\n5\n00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.200\nwho do we have for\nus today but Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.490\nMike how you doing today Sir?\n\n7\n00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.956\n>> It is going great Wes, I am excited to\nbe here because as you said we are talking\n\n8\n00:00:30.956 --> 00:00:35.217\nabout group policy today and it is up\nthere in my top five to talk about group\n\n9\n00:00:35.217 --> 00:00:40.378\npolicy, DNS these are core composites in\nmanaging an enterprise environment so\n\n10\n00:00:40.378 --> 00:00:43.046\nit is one of my favorite\ntopics to talk about.\n\n11\n00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:48.421\n>> All right very good so we are going\nto have a lot on the show, tap today.\n\n12\n00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:52.504\nWe are talking about how we can manage our\ndevices in a centralized fashion today, so\n\n13\n00:00:52.504 --> 00:00:54.587\nMike, what do we got going on first today?\n\n14\n00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:58.962\n>> And let's start with just talking\nabout what the heck is group policy?\n\n15\n00:00:58.962 --> 00:01:00.337\nThat's probably a good place to start.\n\n16\n00:01:00.337 --> 00:01:03.129\nAnd then we'll take a look at some of\nthe tools we can use to manage it.\n\n17\n00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.462\nWe'll do a high level overview\nin this particular episode, and\n\n18\n00:01:07.462 --> 00:01:12.046\nthen as we go through our previous\nepisodes, our future episodes.\n\n19\n00:01:12.046 --> 00:01:14.408\nWe won't go back in time.\n\n20\n00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:19.020\nWe'll get dive deeper and deeper into\nall of these topics so first of all,\n\n21\n00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.150\nwhat is group policy?\n\n22\n00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.029\nGP or group policy is\nMicrosoft's implementation of\n\n23\n00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:26.796\nconfiguration management, right?\n\n24\n00:01:26.796 --> 00:01:31.217\nConfiguration management, when we\nthink about managing our enterprise,\n\n25\n00:01:31.217 --> 00:01:35.566\nmanaging all of those machines that we\nhave out there, all of those users,\n\n26\n00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:38.004\nthere's a lot of settings that we can do.\n\n27\n00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:41.050\nThink about all the things that\nyou can do to your machine.\n\n28\n00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.770\nAll the configurations that you can do.\n\n29\n00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.190\nSimple things like setting\nyour screen saver timeout,\n\n30\n00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.750\nto more complex things like doing folder\nredirection or installing software.\n\n31\n00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.383\nThese are things that we have\nto do managing that enterprise.\n\n32\n00:01:55.383 --> 00:01:58.510\nAnd there's a couple of ways\nI can go about doing it.\n\n33\n00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.739\nI could run around from machine\nto machine to machine and\n\n34\n00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:04.087\nconfigure each machine individually.\n\n35\n00:02:04.087 --> 00:02:07.130\nAnd if I'm in a small shot,\nif we've got four or five machines.\n\n36\n00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.510\nHeck, maybe we're not even\nrunning an active directory.\n\n37\n00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.800\nThat might be my only option, right?\n\n38\n00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.513\nOr, if we are running an active directory,\nbut we're still a small shop, I've got 10,\n\n39\n00:02:17.513 --> 00:02:20.118\n20 machines, maybe I do run around\nfrom machine to machine and\n\n40\n00:02:20.118 --> 00:02:21.297\ndo settings individually.\n\n41\n00:02:21.297 --> 00:02:26.165\nMe personally, I wouldn't, because once we\nget into active directory that's when we\n\n42\n00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:29.999\ncan take advantage of that\ncentralized configuration management.\n\n43\n00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.035\nAnd what that means is I'm gonna be\nable to create policies that define\n\n44\n00:02:36.035 --> 00:02:40.971\nmy configuration, and then I can apply\nthose policies to the machines and\n\n45\n00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:43.296\nthe users out there on my network.\n\n46\n00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:45.546\nAnd I can do it.\n\n47\n00:02:45.546 --> 00:02:49.560\nLet's say I've got a setting that\napplies to every machine on my network.\n\n48\n00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.080\nI can do that using a GPM.\n\n49\n00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.600\nOr maybe I've got\na setting that applies to\n\n50\n00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.840\njust a subsetting of my\ncomputers on my network.\n\n51\n00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.570\nJust the ones in the sales department or\njust the ones in the Gainesville office or\n\n52\n00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.300\njust the ones that are running Windows 8,\n\n53\n00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.290\nwe can do things like\nthat using Group Policy.\n\n54\n00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.770\nSo I don't have to run around and\ndo this manually and\n\n55\n00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.780\ntry to find all those Windows 8 machines.\n\n56\n00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.379\nI'm gonna miss one or two right?\n\n57\n00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.841\nOr I'm gonna miss one of those computers\ndown there in the sales department because\n\n58\n00:03:14.841 --> 00:03:16.980\nthey have it hidden in a corner and\nI didn't see it.\n\n59\n00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.640\nAnd now all of a sudden if I don't\napply those settings to those machines.\n\n60\n00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.511\nIf I miss a few,\n\n61\n00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:25.671\nI've got machines that are out of\ncompliance with my company's policy.\n\n62\n00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:26.254\nAll right?\n\n63\n00:03:26.254 --> 00:03:29.863\nGroup policy lets me do this\nfrom a centralized location and\n\n64\n00:03:29.863 --> 00:03:34.555\nmakes sure that these settings are applied\nto whatever machines I choose, or\n\n65\n00:03:34.555 --> 00:03:39.028\nwhatever users I choose, and do it in\na consistent and reliable fashion,\n\n66\n00:03:39.028 --> 00:03:42.296\nmaking sure that those\nsettings are always applied.\n\n67\n00:03:42.296 --> 00:03:46.290\nAll right?\nAnd we don't miss any of those machine.\n\n68\n00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.610\nSo for an administrator,\ngroup policy is a godsend, right?\n\n69\n00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.004\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n70\n00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:53.712\nOne of the things I'm thinking of,\nyou're mentioning centralized management.\n\n71\n00:03:53.712 --> 00:03:57.623\nYou talk about the whole sneaker net\nthing, and having to manage these in\n\n72\n00:03:57.623 --> 00:04:02.254\na completely decentralized environment\nwith things like application deployment.\n\n73\n00:04:02.254 --> 00:04:05.796\nI can imagine going to each individual\ncomputer and managing its applications,\n\n74\n00:04:05.796 --> 00:04:08.709\nand if something goes wrong on one,\nwell, now we have to go back and\n\n75\n00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.947\nwe have to figure out what\ncomputer went wrong, and\n\n76\n00:04:10.947 --> 00:04:14.463\nso one of the things that comes to Mike\nhere, mind Mike, if I can say that right.\n\n77\n00:04:14.463 --> 00:04:15.429\nMike, mine,\n\n78\n00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:20.420\nwe'll make our own contributions to\nthe English language around here.\n\n79\n00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.180\nOne of the things that does\ncome to mind though is,\n\n80\n00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.550\nthe least administrative effort.\n\n81\n00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.480\nI've heard that term a lot there Mike, and\nthat sounds like what you're explaining.\n\n82\n00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.202\nA way to reduce\nthe administrative complexity, or\n\n83\n00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:31.046\noverhead inside of our networks.\n\n84\n00:04:31.046 --> 00:04:34.377\n>> Absolutely, those Microsoft exams,\nthey love that term,\n\n85\n00:04:34.377 --> 00:04:38.822\nwhich solution would you choose with\nthe least administrative effort because it\n\n86\n00:04:38.822 --> 00:04:42.940\nwill work me running around touching\nevery single machine and configuring\n\n87\n00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.450\ntheir screen saver settings or what\never the case may be that is a solution.\n\n88\n00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.356\nIt will work, but it's a whole lot more\nwork than me configuring at once in\n\n89\n00:04:51.356 --> 00:04:55.262\na group policy object and having that\nactive directory in group policy and\n\n90\n00:04:55.262 --> 00:04:59.483\ncline side extensions all work together\nto apply those which would you settings\n\n91\n00:04:59.483 --> 00:05:01.379\nto all those machines, all right?\n\n92\n00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.304\nSo if it's definitely a concept\nthat we can bring in here,\n\n93\n00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:07.649\nwe'll talk about group policy and\ngroup policy administration,\n\n94\n00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:10.171\nit's the least administrative effort,\nright?\n\n95\n00:05:10.171 --> 00:05:13.421\nIt's gonna make our jobs easier.\nAnd who doesn't want to do that?\n\n96\n00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:14.422\n>> That's right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n97\n00:05:14.422 --> 00:05:16.482\n>> Now when we talk about group policy,\n\n98\n00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:20.936\nMike, I'm sure there's gonna be some\nbasic prerequisites to even using group\n\n99\n00:05:20.936 --> 00:05:21.610\npolicies.\n\n100\n00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.610\nWhat are some of those things that\nwe have to have on tap ready to\n\n101\n00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.320\ngo before we can even start using this.\n\n102\n00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.504\n>> Well, really,\nit's just active directory.\n\n103\n00:05:27.504 --> 00:05:28.830\nIs what it comes down to.\n\n104\n00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.462\nWhen you install active directory,\nwhen you create a domain.\n\n105\n00:05:32.462 --> 00:05:36.636\nLet's say you're in a SoHo and so\nfar you've got a couple file servers and\n\n106\n00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:41.504\nthree or four client machines and a couple\nemployees or what have you, and no domain.\n\n107\n00:05:41.504 --> 00:05:44.088\nWell you can work with what we\ncall your local policies, or\n\n108\n00:05:44.088 --> 00:05:47.003\nyou can configure those settings\nindividually on each machine.\n\n109\n00:05:47.003 --> 00:05:49.296\nAs soon as you create your domain.\n\n110\n00:05:49.296 --> 00:05:53.407\nAs soon as you take one of your servers\nand you install Active Directory on it,\n\n111\n00:05:53.407 --> 00:05:57.086\nyou've created your first domain and\nyou've created your fourth.\n\n112\n00:05:57.086 --> 00:06:00.739\nAnd along with Active Directory\ncomes group policy,\n\n113\n00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:05.853\nthe ability to do that centralized\nadministration, my page management or\n\n114\n00:06:05.853 --> 00:06:10.740\nI should say my configuration\nmanagement again, using group policy.\n\n115\n00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.040\nSo, it's really just a matter of\nmoving to a domain environment.\n\n116\n00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.671\nAnd once you do that,\nyou have access to group policy.\n\n117\n00:06:17.671 --> 00:06:20.930\nSo the next thing we should look at\nthen is, how do we work with it?\n\n118\n00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.830\nAgain, we are gonna do a high\nlevel overview here, and\n\n119\n00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.660\nthen we are gonna break all\nof these tools down and\n\n120\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.480\nreally take a look at things that\nwe can do with group policies.\n\n121\n00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.680\nAnd how we configure it, and\nhow we can keep them safe,\n\n122\n00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.410\nand that kind of thing as we\ngo through our show here.\n\n123\n00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.505\nBut, let's start by just\nlooking at the tools.\n\n124\n00:06:38.505 --> 00:06:41.587\nSo, what I've got on my screen\nhere is a domain controller.\n\n125\n00:06:41.587 --> 00:06:45.015\nI just installed Active Directory\non this machine, so\n\n126\n00:06:45.015 --> 00:06:47.420\nall of this is the basic defaults.\n\n127\n00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.645\nAnd server managers opened up and\nwhen I go to my tools menu,\n\n128\n00:06:51.645 --> 00:06:55.629\nI'm gonna see that I have\ngroup policy management now.\n\n129\n00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:58.254\nThat was installed when I\ninstalled Active Directory.\n\n130\n00:06:58.254 --> 00:07:02.659\nIf you remember in our other episodes or\nother series that we've done when you\n\n131\n00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:06.004\ninstall Active Directory anywhere role for\nthat matter.\n\n132\n00:07:06.004 --> 00:07:07.540\nThe wizard will prompt you and\n\n133\n00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.421\nsay hey, do you want to install\nthe administrative tools along with this?\n\n134\n00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:14.337\nAnd I chose yes, and\nthat's why I have access to these.\n\n135\n00:07:14.337 --> 00:07:16.838\nSo if I click on group policy management,\n\n136\n00:07:16.838 --> 00:07:20.627\nthat's gonna open up my\nGroup Policy Management Console, and\n\n137\n00:07:20.627 --> 00:07:23.500\nthis is where I can work\nwith my group policies.\n\n138\n00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.672\nAs I expand out my fours, the\nlab.itpro.tv, and expand out my domains,\n\n139\n00:07:28.672 --> 00:07:32.284\nand then I expand out the Domain,\nlab.itpro.tv,\n\n140\n00:07:32.284 --> 00:07:36.223\nI'll see a list of the current OUs,\nor the existing OUs,\n\n141\n00:07:36.223 --> 00:07:41.421\nin Active Directory, and I'll see that\nI have a couple of GPOs by default.\n\n142\n00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:43.171\nLike I said,\nhaven't made any changes to group policy.\n\n143\n00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:47.463\nThe only thing I've done so far is create\na couple OUs so we'll have something to\n\n144\n00:07:47.463 --> 00:07:51.600\nwork with, and we'll create more as\nwe go throughout this set of videos.\n\n145\n00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.520\nBut there's my two policies\nthat I get by default.\n\n146\n00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.587\nThe default domain policy, and\nthe default domain controller policy.\n\n147\n00:07:58.587 --> 00:08:02.314\nWe'll come back and take a look at\nwhat we do with those policies and\n\n148\n00:08:02.314 --> 00:08:04.254\nwhy they are there in a little bit.\n\n149\n00:08:04.254 --> 00:08:08.570\nBut just understand now that out of\nthe box installing Active Directory,\n\n150\n00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.360\nI've already got two\ngroup policies in place.\n\n151\n00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.060\nAnd Group Policy Management Console is\nthe tool I'm gonna use to work with them.\n\n152\n00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:21.590\nAnd when I say work with them, I mean we\ncan create new GPO using this console.\n\n153\n00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.128\nI can come down here to group policy\nobjects, then I can choose new.\n\n154\n00:08:25.128 --> 00:08:26.671\nAnd maybe I'll give it a name.\n\n155\n00:08:26.671 --> 00:08:30.172\nI'll call this one test GPO.\n\n156\n00:08:30.172 --> 00:08:31.921\nAnd we'll clink Enter.\n\n157\n00:08:31.921 --> 00:08:34.587\nAnd there's my new GPO\nthat I just created.\n\n158\n00:08:34.587 --> 00:08:36.671\nSo we can create new ones in here.\n\n159\n00:08:36.671 --> 00:08:39.713\nWe can also decide where\nwe wanna scope these GPOs,\n\n160\n00:08:39.713 --> 00:08:42.634\nanother concept that\nwe're gonna come back to.\n\n161\n00:08:42.634 --> 00:08:46.520\nBut when we create GPOs,\nwe gotta decide who it applies to,\n\n162\n00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.962\nI can do that through\nbasically linking those GPOs.\n\n163\n00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:52.297\nI can also edit the GPOs.\n\n164\n00:08:52.297 --> 00:08:56.847\nAnother important concept that we're gonna\ntake a good hard look at, but for now,\n\n165\n00:08:56.847 --> 00:09:00.296\nthat policy that I just made is\nbasically a blank policy, Wes.\n\n166\n00:09:00.296 --> 00:09:01.629\nThere's not settings in it, right?\n\n167\n00:09:01.629 --> 00:09:04.378\nI created this container for settings.\n\n168\n00:09:04.378 --> 00:09:08.047\nUntil I go back and edit the policy and\nactually decide, what I wanna do.\n\n169\n00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:10.800\nDo I want to set that screen\nsaver time now the 15 minutes?\n\n170\n00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.700\nDo I wanna install Office?\n\n171\n00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.088\nWhat settings do I wanna configure?\n\n172\n00:09:14.088 --> 00:09:16.004\nThe policy's basically a blank.\n\n173\n00:09:16.004 --> 00:09:20.800\nAnd there's another tool that we get\nwhen we install Active Directory that we\n\n174\n00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.879\nuse to actually modify the GPUs.\n\n175\n00:09:22.879 --> 00:09:25.379\nAnd that's my group\npolicy management editor.\n\n176\n00:09:25.379 --> 00:09:30.179\nSo I simply right clicked on that GPO and\nI chose to edit that policy, and\n\n177\n00:09:30.179 --> 00:09:35.619\nyou'll see a separate tool opens up called\nthe group policy Management editor,\n\n178\n00:09:35.619 --> 00:09:40.739\nand here I'm working with a single GPO,\nand this is where I can go in and start\n\n179\n00:09:40.739 --> 00:09:46.754\nconfiguring all of the different settings,\nwhatever I'm choosing to do with this GPO.\n\n180\n00:09:46.754 --> 00:09:50.766\nSo, two big tools that we get there\ngroup policy management console,\n\n181\n00:09:50.766 --> 00:09:55.458\nand the group policy management editor\nare available on my domain controller when\n\n182\n00:09:55.458 --> 00:09:57.171\nI install active directory.\n\n183\n00:09:57.171 --> 00:10:01.076\nThere is a third one that we can\nuse on this domain controller, and\n\n184\n00:10:01.076 --> 00:10:02.712\nthat would be power shell.\n\n185\n00:10:02.712 --> 00:10:06.421\nWe can't leave out power shell, everything\nis done with power shell nowadays.\n\n186\n00:10:06.421 --> 00:10:09.550\n>> Yeah, the good old CLI there, and\nyou're unfortunately an active directory,\n\n187\n00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.170\nyou're not going to get rid of it either.\n\n188\n00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:15.074\nOne of the things I am thinking, Mike,\nif I have my laptop or my computer, and\n\n189\n00:10:15.074 --> 00:10:19.279\nyou're the systems admin on a domain, can\nI just bring my computer off of the street\n\n190\n00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:23.062\ninto your network and then you can just\nstart pushing out these policies and\n\n191\n00:10:23.062 --> 00:10:26.750\ncontrolling the configurations on\nmy computer right off the street?\n\n192\n00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.296\n>> No.\n\n193\n00:10:27.296 --> 00:10:28.478\nIt does have to be part of the domain.\nBecause what's going to\n\n194\n00:10:28.478 --> 00:10:29.786\nhappen is when those machines start up,\n\n195\n00:10:29.786 --> 00:10:32.295\nthere gonna check with active directory,\nthey're going to authenticate.\n\n196\n00:10:32.295 --> 00:10:35.837\nAnd they're going to retrieve a list of\npolicies that they're supposed to apply.\n\n197\n00:10:35.837 --> 00:10:40.115\nAnd we'll see there's another great topic\nthat we're going to spend a lot of time\n\n198\n00:10:40.115 --> 00:10:44.087\non because we really need to understand\nthe way those policies are applied.\n\n199\n00:10:44.087 --> 00:10:47.254\nSo you're going to just make\na difference in what settings are there.\n\n200\n00:10:47.254 --> 00:10:50.750\nLet me open up power show real quick and\njust take a look.\n\n201\n00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:51.360\nI will tell you, Wes,\n\n202\n00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.210\nthat I don't use PowerShell a whole\nlot to work with group policy objects.\n\n203\n00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.602\nPowerShell, I love PowerShell and\n\n204\n00:10:57.602 --> 00:11:01.921\neverything that we do in the GUI\ncan be done through PowerShell.\n\n205\n00:11:01.921 --> 00:11:07.087\nAnd the power of PowerShell is\nthe fact that I can script it.\n\n206\n00:11:07.087 --> 00:11:09.689\nBut a lot of times when I'm working with\ngroup policy objects it's not something\n\n207\n00:11:09.689 --> 00:11:10.610\nthat I do everyday.\n\n208\n00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.620\nIt's not something that I do repeatedly.\n\n209\n00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.046\nI make a new GPO, but it's got\na different name in a different settings.\n\n210\n00:11:16.046 --> 00:11:20.385\nIf I don't find a lot of things\nthat I need to modify or\n\n211\n00:11:20.385 --> 00:11:24.045\nto do repeatedly, I should say, with GPO.\n\n212\n00:11:24.045 --> 00:11:25.963\nSo I don't do a lot of scripting with it.\n\n213\n00:11:25.963 --> 00:11:30.483\nBut it is important we understand\nthat when we install active directory\n\n214\n00:11:30.483 --> 00:11:35.047\nwe get the module that includes\ncommandlets to work with group policy.\n\n215\n00:11:35.047 --> 00:11:41.120\nLet me show you here,\nyou can do a the get- command- module, and\n\n216\n00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:47.320\nthen group policy, if I can spell that,\nis the name of the module.\n\n217\n00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.113\nAnd we'll let it list and there is all\nthe commands that I get access to now that\n\n218\n00:11:54.113 --> 00:11:56.727\nI've got active directory installed, and\n\n219\n00:11:56.727 --> 00:11:59.780\nit installed the group\npolicy module to work with.\n\n220\n00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.514\nSo you can see things like\ngetting permissions and\n\n221\n00:12:01.514 --> 00:12:03.948\nsetting group policy permissions,\nbacking up and copying them, and\n\n222\n00:12:03.948 --> 00:12:05.320\njust getting a list of GPOs that exist.\n\n223\n00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:10.594\nDoing some, all the gets, remember,\ngets are basically read commands,\n\n224\n00:12:10.594 --> 00:12:14.195\nso we can get information\nabout individual GPOs and\n\n225\n00:12:14.195 --> 00:12:17.390\npermissions and resultant set of policies.\n\n226\n00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:23.650\nDon't worry, all terms we're gonna\ndefine as we go through these videos.\n\n227\n00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:28.611\nDoing a GP update, or linking GPOs,\ndeleting or removing GPOs,\n\n228\n00:12:28.611 --> 00:12:35.110\nsetting permissions and properties, and\nI think Wesley that's the big thing here,\n\n229\n00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:39.280\nthrough PowerShell it's\npretty easy to create a GPO.\n\n230\n00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.156\nIn fact we could do a new-GPO command and\nthen I'm gonna\n\n231\n00:12:44.156 --> 00:12:49.263\npipe that out into a,\nlet me give it a name sorry, -name.\n\n232\n00:12:49.263 --> 00:12:53.410\nAnd I could call this one [COUGH]\nsomething like test2, hit Enter and\n\n233\n00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:58.230\nit just created a new GPO, so if we look\nat my group policy management console.\n\n234\n00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.183\nAnd we go take a look in here somewhere,\n\n235\n00:13:01.183 --> 00:13:06.030\nas soon as it decides to open up,\nit's thinking about it there.\n\n236\n00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:10.708\n>> Gotta love the refresh times,\ntoo, on server manager\n\n237\n00:13:10.708 --> 00:13:15.600\nwhen you're waiting for\nit to pull up that information.\n\n238\n00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.610\nIt's got to think about it, talk to\nthe server, say hello computer wake up.\n\n239\n00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.342\n>> There it goes.\nSo now if I take a look inside group\n\n240\n00:13:23.342 --> 00:13:27.252\npolicy objects,\nthere is my test2 that I just created,\n\n241\n00:13:27.252 --> 00:13:30.924\npretty easy to create an new\nGPO through PowerShell.\n\n242\n00:13:30.924 --> 00:13:34.582\nBut when you go to configure\nthe individual settings within PowerShell,\n\n243\n00:13:34.582 --> 00:13:38.240\nthat's where it gets really, I'm trying\nto think of a good way to say it,\n\n244\n00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.190\nto me, it is way too much work.\n\n245\n00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.831\nYou can create registry entries and\n\n246\n00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:44.188\nyou can set values in those\nGPOs using PowerShell.\n\n247\n00:13:44.188 --> 00:13:47.376\nAnd the GUI in my opinion is the way\nto go when it comes to that, but\n\n248\n00:13:47.376 --> 00:13:50.760\njust understand, that we do have\nthose commands there available.\n\n249\n00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.800\nIf we wanted to delete a GPO\nreal quick we could, so.\n\n250\n00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.350\nWe'll take a look at those commands and\n\n251\n00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:02.770\nwe'll look at actually making changes to\na GPO and linking a GPO in later episodes.\n\n252\n00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:05.560\nSo we've got three tools that we've seen.\n\n253\n00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:10.444\nWe've seen the group policy management\nconsole which is our main tool that\n\n254\n00:14:10.444 --> 00:14:13.010\nwe use to create and scope or link GPOs.\n\n255\n00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:17.440\nAnd then we've got that group policy\nmanagement editor which is our tool\n\n256\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.819\nthat we use to modify,\n\n257\n00:14:18.819 --> 00:14:24.230\nto actually configure the settings that\nI wanna deploy throughout my network.\n\n258\n00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:28.355\nAnd then we've also got that group policy\nmodule that gets loaded up into PowerShell\n\n259\n00:14:28.355 --> 00:14:31.550\nthat makes all those things that I\ncan do through the GUI available\n\n260\n00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:32.672\nthrough PowerShell.\n\n261\n00:14:32.672 --> 00:14:36.038\nSo, as far a administering GPO if I'm on\nto the main controller those are those\n\n262\n00:14:36.038 --> 00:14:38.180\nare my different tools\nthat we're going to have.\n\n263\n00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:42.755\nNow next thing I want to take about is\nthat I want to talk about doing it from\n\n264\n00:14:42.755 --> 00:14:43.890\nanother server.\n\n265\n00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:48.881\nIf I'm running, let's say, believe it or\nnot, Wes, some people like to\n\n266\n00:14:48.881 --> 00:14:53.560\nrun the server operating system as\ntheir everyday operating system,\n\n267\n00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.400\nespecially geeks like us.\n\n268\n00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.000\nYou know you might actually find people\n\n269\n00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.230\nwith server 2012 installed on their\ndesktop or installed on their laptop.\n\n270\n00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:03.461\nYou know, if you're not gaming or\nanything like that,\n\n271\n00:15:03.461 --> 00:15:05.130\nit's a pretty stable operating system.\n\n272\n00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:10.240\nBut what if I want to manage group\npolicy from this machine here?\n\n273\n00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.894\nWell the problem is,\nif I go to tools, and I take a look,\n\n274\n00:15:12.894 --> 00:15:15.620\nI don't have any of those\nactive directory components.\n\n275\n00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.240\nBecause this is not a domain controller.\n\n276\n00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.843\nSo it never installed,\n\n277\n00:15:19.843 --> 00:15:24.491\nI never went through the Active\nDirectory Installation Wizard, and\n\n278\n00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:29.462\nI never installed the snap-ins necessary\nto manage Active Directory and\n\n279\n00:15:29.462 --> 00:15:31.400\ntherefore, group policy.\n\n280\n00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.883\nBut because it's a server operating\nsystem, all those snap-ins are there,\n\n281\n00:15:33.883 --> 00:15:34.753\nI just need to enable them.\n\n282\n00:15:34.753 --> 00:15:35.983\nAnd it's easy to do.\n\n283\n00:15:35.983 --> 00:15:39.582\nIf I take a look, I'll go in here and\nadd roles and features.\n\n284\n00:15:39.582 --> 00:15:46.107\nAnd I'll click Next a couple times\nto work my way through this wizard.\n\n285\n00:15:46.107 --> 00:15:49.566\nAnd we'll let it whir and grind for\na second and build up its list here.\n\n286\n00:15:49.566 --> 00:15:52.150\nI'm choosing to do this on Server 1.\n\n287\n00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:56.160\n>> And there's those refresh periods every\ntime it communicates with the server,\n\n288\n00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.150\nit's got to talk to it, right?\n\n289\n00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:00.325\nI think that's how it works and then\nit's got to find out what's going on and\n\n290\n00:16:00.325 --> 00:16:00.880\nfigure out.\n\n291\n00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.239\n>> I see an issue right now,\nif I look at that in my system tray,\n\n292\n00:16:04.239 --> 00:16:08.541\nI've got a maintenance task going on,\nwhich we're going to kill real quick\n\n293\n00:16:08.541 --> 00:16:11.520\nbecause that is going to\nsuck up all of my resources.\n\n294\n00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.164\nWe're going to stop that\nmaintenance there, and\n\n295\n00:16:15.164 --> 00:16:17.777\nwe'll speed things up real quick.\n\n296\n00:16:17.777 --> 00:16:18.891\nWe don't need that firewall.\n\n297\n00:16:18.891 --> 00:16:20.123\n>> I know, right.\n\n298\n00:16:20.123 --> 00:16:21.725\n>> This is a lab environment.\n\n299\n00:16:21.725 --> 00:16:23.771\nThese guys do not have Internet access so\n\n300\n00:16:23.771 --> 00:16:26.560\nwe're not going to be worried\nabout that right here.\n\n301\n00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.130\nAnd then when I get to my roles screen\nI don't want to install the role,\n\n302\n00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.660\nI want to install just\nthe tools to manage it.\n\n303\n00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:37.110\nSo I'm gonna skip roles and\nI'll come to my features and\n\n304\n00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:41.850\nwhat I want is that group policy\nmanagement console, right?\n\n305\n00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.167\nNow, if I wanted the other\nActive Directory tools I could go down to\n\n306\n00:16:45.167 --> 00:16:48.366\nremote server admin tools and\nI could install those as well, but\n\n307\n00:16:48.366 --> 00:16:51.350\nhere we're going to be focused\nprimarily on group policy.\n\n308\n00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.010\nSo, I'll just do the group\npolicy management.\n\n309\n00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:56.130\nI'll click Next, and\nthen I'll click Install.\n\n310\n00:16:56.130 --> 00:17:00.510\nAnd that will go through and install my\nconsole, and it'll take it just a minute.\n\n311\n00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:05.480\nAnd the point really that we're making\nhere is that if you're running the server\n\n312\n00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.697\noperating system,\nthere's nothing to download,\n\n313\n00:17:08.697 --> 00:17:11.270\nthere's nothing to get from Microsoft.\n\n314\n00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.330\nAll those Admin tools are there.\n\n315\n00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:16.290\nIt's just that if the role's not\ninstalled, they're not available.\n\n316\n00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:20.460\nAll I have to do is go in and choose which\ntools I want, and it will install them.\n\n317\n00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.089\nSo now when I close my wizard and\nI go to Tools,\n\n318\n00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:26.230\nI'll have access to\nGroup Policy Management.\n\n319\n00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.905\nSo, even though this machine\nis not a domain controller,\n\n320\n00:17:29.905 --> 00:17:33.505\ntherefore does not have\nthe Active Directory database or\n\n321\n00:17:33.505 --> 00:17:37.340\nany of those policies,\nI can still remotely administer it.\n\n322\n00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.560\nI can work my way down, and\nI can connect to my domain,\n\n323\n00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.740\nand I can work with those same GPOs.\n\n324\n00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.120\nThere's those test GPOs that\nI created earlier, okay.\n\n325\n00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.232\nI'm just reaching out and talking\nto that domain controller remotely.\n\n326\n00:17:49.232 --> 00:17:53.130\nAll right, and so, that's how we\nwould manage it from a server.\n\n327\n00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.030\n>> Very good.\n\n328\n00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:58.070\nNow, let's say you're not running a server\noperating system, see I'm not a geek,\n\n329\n00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.000\nyeah nobody's going to believe that but-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n330\n00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.743\n>> If I don't have a server operating\n\n331\n00:18:02.743 --> 00:18:06.587\nsystem on my machine, is there another\nscenario in which we might use that,\n\n332\n00:18:06.587 --> 00:18:09.905\nI think it's RSAT,\nthe remote server administration toolkit?\n\n333\n00:18:09.905 --> 00:18:12.785\nOr do we have to be on a server\noperating system in order to use this?\n\n334\n00:18:12.785 --> 00:18:16.409\n>> No, you can actually do this from\nyour client machine as well, and\n\n335\n00:18:16.409 --> 00:18:19.985\nthat's probably a more common scenario,\nto be honest with you.\n\n336\n00:18:19.985 --> 00:18:23.835\nIn a small shop where it's just you,\nyou're the domain admin and\n\n337\n00:18:23.835 --> 00:18:28.455\nEverything else, then you might just\nremote in to your domain controllers and\n\n338\n00:18:28.455 --> 00:18:30.415\nwork with it that way.\n\n339\n00:18:30.415 --> 00:18:35.934\nOr what have you, but as we grow,\nI wanna start delegating out tasks.\n\n340\n00:18:35.934 --> 00:18:40.055\nI wanna let a certain person\nwork with a particular GPO.\n\n341\n00:18:40.055 --> 00:18:41.715\nI'm not gonna make them a domain admin.\n\n342\n00:18:41.715 --> 00:18:46.582\nI'm not gonna allow them to log on to my\ndomain controllers if I just want them\n\n343\n00:18:46.582 --> 00:18:50.554\nto work with group policy or\neven an individual group policy.\n\n344\n00:18:50.554 --> 00:18:51.587\nSo, yes, we can.\n\n345\n00:18:51.587 --> 00:18:56.268\nWe can add the Remote Server Admin Tools\nto our client operating system.\n\n346\n00:18:56.268 --> 00:19:00.173\nAnd then, as we just saw on the server,\nwe can just take those snap ins and\n\n347\n00:19:00.173 --> 00:19:01.660\npoint them to the machine.\n\n348\n00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.762\nSo let's take a look\nat how we can do that.\n\n349\n00:19:03.762 --> 00:19:07.682\nI've got a Windows 10 box here and\nI've already taken the time to\n\n350\n00:19:07.682 --> 00:19:11.466\ndownload the Remote Server Admin Tools\nas well as install them.\n\n351\n00:19:11.466 --> 00:19:15.306\nBecause it is not a long process,\ndownloading it is, I don't know,\n\n352\n00:19:15.306 --> 00:19:18.432\n50 megs or something like that,\nit's not too large.\n\n353\n00:19:18.432 --> 00:19:21.274\nJust do a search for\nRemote Server Admin Tools and\n\n354\n00:19:21.274 --> 00:19:25.513\nyou'll find Microsoft, where you\ncan download those from Microsoft.\n\n355\n00:19:25.513 --> 00:19:29.529\nDo be careful, it is version specific,\nnot to what you're managing, but\n\n356\n00:19:29.529 --> 00:19:31.783\nwhat you are installing them on, right?\n\n357\n00:19:31.783 --> 00:19:35.519\nSo, if you are going to install\nRemote Server Admin Tools on Windows 10,\n\n358\n00:19:35.519 --> 00:19:38.922\nthen you need to get the Remote\nServer Admin Tools for Windows 10.\n\n359\n00:19:38.922 --> 00:19:43.457\nIf you're running 8.1, you need to\ndownload the RSAT tools for 8.1, and\n\n360\n00:19:43.457 --> 00:19:44.889\nthe same for Windows 7.\n\n361\n00:19:44.889 --> 00:19:48.909\nSo it's specific to the version of\nthe operating system you're installing\n\n362\n00:19:48.909 --> 00:19:52.133\nthem on, as well as the platform,\n32 bit versus 64 bit.\n\n363\n00:19:52.133 --> 00:19:53.632\nSo make sure you get the right one.\n\n364\n00:19:53.632 --> 00:19:57.973\nAnd when you run it, it is basically\na Windows Update, is what it is.\n\n365\n00:19:57.973 --> 00:20:00.596\nI can't remember the exact KB number.\n\n366\n00:20:00.596 --> 00:20:03.278\nYou run that,\nit'll install all those tools.\n\n367\n00:20:03.278 --> 00:20:07.989\nNow in the past, if you've ever used RSAT\nbefore, let's just say Windows XP and\n\n368\n00:20:07.989 --> 00:20:12.575\nprior, what what happened is when you\ninstalled it, nothing would change.\n\n369\n00:20:12.575 --> 00:20:13.975\nYou would look at your system and\n\n370\n00:20:13.975 --> 00:20:16.645\nyou wouldn't see those\nRemote Server Admin Tools anywhere.\n\n371\n00:20:16.645 --> 00:20:18.166\nThey were nowhere to be found.\n\n372\n00:20:18.166 --> 00:20:21.994\nYou just spent all this time downloading\nit and running it and that's\n\n373\n00:20:21.994 --> 00:20:26.352\nthe part that can take a little while,\nit can take a little bit to install them.\n\n374\n00:20:26.352 --> 00:20:28.060\nAnd then you're like,\nwell, where did they go?\n\n375\n00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.367\nSo in the past,\nyou had to go to your add/remove program.\n\n376\n00:20:31.367 --> 00:20:35.251\nOnce you installed RSAT, Remote Server\nAdmin Tools, you have to go and\n\n377\n00:20:35.251 --> 00:20:36.750\npick which tools you want.\n\n378\n00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.438\nThey were all available but they didn't\nput them on your Start Menu because they\n\n379\n00:20:40.438 --> 00:20:44.305\nfigure you're not using all of them, you\nprobably did this for a particular tool.\n\n380\n00:20:44.305 --> 00:20:48.283\nSo they left it up to you to install\nRemote Server Admin Tool and\n\n381\n00:20:48.283 --> 00:20:52.647\nthen go into your add/remove programs or\nyour Windows features and\n\n382\n00:20:52.647 --> 00:20:57.261\npick the particular tool that you\nwanted to show off on your Start Menu.\n\n383\n00:20:57.261 --> 00:21:01.196\nWith Windows 10, as well as Windows 8,\nthese just show up.\n\n384\n00:21:01.196 --> 00:21:06.466\nIn fact, if I go over to my Start Menu\nnow, I'll see nothing shows up here.\n\n385\n00:21:06.466 --> 00:21:10.274\nBut if I go to All Apps and\nI scroll down a little bit,\n\n386\n00:21:10.274 --> 00:21:13.560\nwe're gonna see Windows Administrative.\n\n387\n00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:18.517\nLet me see if I can try to\nstretch that out a wee bit,\n\n388\n00:21:18.517 --> 00:21:23.138\nif it'll let me,\nit's not gonna play along.\n\n389\n00:21:23.138 --> 00:21:25.975\nAnd I'll go to my Windows Administrative\ntemplates and here they are.\n\n390\n00:21:25.975 --> 00:21:28.914\nThese are the same tools I was\nseeing on that server, all right.\n\n391\n00:21:28.914 --> 00:21:33.129\nActive Directory users and computers,\nwe scroll down a little bit,\n\n392\n00:21:33.129 --> 00:21:35.902\nthere's good old Group Policy Management.\n\n393\n00:21:35.902 --> 00:21:40.035\nI can launch that, and\nnotice it's the same console.\n\n394\n00:21:40.035 --> 00:21:45.065\nAll right, there's my forest,\nI expand out my domains, I expand out lab.\n\n395\n00:21:45.065 --> 00:21:48.724\nThere's all of my group policy\nobjects that we had created, and\n\n396\n00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:50.436\nthose two default policies.\n\n397\n00:21:50.436 --> 00:21:54.531\nSo now, from your client operating system,\nsitting there in your cubicle,\n\n398\n00:21:54.531 --> 00:21:57.496\non your little laptop,\nyou can work with group policy.\n\n399\n00:21:57.496 --> 00:22:00.943\nOr, I can give somebody else\naccess to group policy.\n\n400\n00:22:00.943 --> 00:22:02.627\nI can delegate, right?\n\n401\n00:22:02.627 --> 00:22:06.113\nIf I've got, and I'm gonna show\nyou how to do all of this stuff.\n\n402\n00:22:06.113 --> 00:22:10.383\nBut if I got a policy for my sales\ndepartment that handles all the settings\n\n403\n00:22:10.383 --> 00:22:14.947\nthat sales needs, I might go to that\nsales manager and say, you know what?\n\n404\n00:22:14.947 --> 00:22:17.806\nI'm gonna let you be in\ncharge of this policy.\n\n405\n00:22:17.806 --> 00:22:19.743\nYou're in charge of the sales department.\n\n406\n00:22:19.743 --> 00:22:22.241\nYou can work with the GPO for\nthe sales department.\n\n407\n00:22:22.241 --> 00:22:26.047\nI can create, I can install those\nRemote Server Admin Tools on his machine.\n\n408\n00:22:26.047 --> 00:22:28.253\nI can give him access to this console.\n\n409\n00:22:28.253 --> 00:22:29.658\nI can control his permissions.\n\n410\n00:22:29.658 --> 00:22:34.219\nNow, I'm logged on as the domain admin,\nwhich is why I get to see everything, and\n\n411\n00:22:34.219 --> 00:22:35.555\nwork with everything.\n\n412\n00:22:35.555 --> 00:22:37.010\nYou can't just download,\n\n413\n00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:40.869\nlike you can't have a user just\ndownload the Remote Server Admin Tools,\n\n414\n00:22:40.869 --> 00:22:44.487\nand try to connect and start working\nwith group policy, all right.\n\n415\n00:22:44.487 --> 00:22:47.897\nThere are certain permissions that\nare gonna be required in order for\n\n416\n00:22:47.897 --> 00:22:51.679\nthem to do that, which again,\nis another episode we're gonna talk about.\n\n417\n00:22:51.679 --> 00:22:54.700\nSo can you manage it from\nthe domain controller itself or\n\n418\n00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.634\nyou can install active directory.\n\n419\n00:22:56.634 --> 00:23:00.048\nYou can manage it remotely from\na server operating system.\n\n420\n00:23:00.048 --> 00:23:04.306\nThe tools are already there, I just need\nto make them available by going through my\n\n421\n00:23:04.306 --> 00:23:08.705\nadd roles and features wizard, and I want\nto do this from a client operating system.\n\n422\n00:23:08.705 --> 00:23:12.365\nThen I need to download the Remote\nServer Admin Tools from Microsoft.\n\n423\n00:23:12.365 --> 00:23:15.885\nI've got to make sure I get the right\noperating system version for\n\n424\n00:23:15.885 --> 00:23:19.735\nwhat I'm running on my client machine,\nas well as the right platform.\n\n425\n00:23:19.735 --> 00:23:21.094\nWe can also do PowerShell.\n\n426\n00:23:21.094 --> 00:23:26.899\nWhen I install those tools, the PowerShell\nmodule for group policy is also installed.\n\n427\n00:23:26.899 --> 00:23:29.803\nSo I can work with it\nremotely using PowerShell.\n\n428\n00:23:29.803 --> 00:23:33.765\nAssuming PS remoting has been\nenabled on those domain controllers.\n\n429\n00:23:33.765 --> 00:23:36.802\nSo, Wes, several different ways we can\nadminister or work with group policy.\n\n430\n00:23:36.802 --> 00:23:37.404\n>> All right.\n\n431\n00:23:37.404 --> 00:23:38.220\nVery good.\n\n432\n00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.935\nSo, we've talked about things like\na group policy management console.\n\n433\n00:23:41.935 --> 00:23:44.855\nWe've talked about things like\nthe group policy management editor.\n\n434\n00:23:44.855 --> 00:23:48.797\nAnd if you really wanna dive into Active\nDirectory, we've talked about PowerShell,\n\n435\n00:23:48.797 --> 00:23:52.154\nstripping off the GUI, and the underlying\nengine beneath is all you get.\n\n436\n00:23:52.154 --> 00:23:54.657\nYou got text-based input,\ntext-based output, so\n\n437\n00:23:54.657 --> 00:23:57.331\ndefinitely something that you can use,\nvery powerful.\n\n438\n00:23:57.331 --> 00:24:00.721\nWe talked about\nthe Remote Server Administration Tool kit,\n\n439\n00:24:00.721 --> 00:24:02.454\nwhich is a great thing to have.\n\n440\n00:24:02.454 --> 00:24:05.132\nIt doesn't matter if you're on\none of your member servers or\n\n441\n00:24:05.132 --> 00:24:06.916\nif you have got a laptop in your cubicle,\n\n442\n00:24:06.916 --> 00:24:10.555\nit's a great way that you can connect to\nyour domain controller over the network.\n\n443\n00:24:10.555 --> 00:24:14.731\nManage those individual settings within\nyour group policy, you don't have to do\n\n444\n00:24:14.731 --> 00:24:19.041\nthe sneakernet, you don't have to remote\ninto your server from another location.\n\n445\n00:24:19.041 --> 00:24:19.982\nAll great stuff.\n\n446\n00:24:19.982 --> 00:24:23.744\nOkay Mike, you got anything else, anything\nelse that we'd like to know out there?\n\n447\n00:24:23.744 --> 00:24:25.063\n>> Oh, we've got a ton-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n448\n00:24:25.063 --> 00:24:26.623\n>> Of stuff that we're gonna talk\n\n449\n00:24:26.623 --> 00:24:28.185\nabout but not in this episode.\n\n450\n00:24:28.185 --> 00:24:29.355\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, well,\n\n451\n00:24:29.355 --> 00:24:32.175\nit looks like we're coming\nto the end of this episode.\n\n452\n00:24:32.175 --> 00:24:33.795\nAnd hope you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n453\n00:24:33.795 --> 00:24:37.043\nBut we're gonna be moving on to\nmore Group Policy, so come back and\n\n454\n00:24:37.043 --> 00:24:40.934\ntake a look at those episodes but until\nthen, I've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n455\n00:24:40.934 --> 00:24:41.792\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n456\n00:24:41.792 --> 00:24:42.849\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n457\n00:24:42.849

00:00:17.775\nMy name is Wes Bryan and\nI'm gonna be your host today.\n\n4\n00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:21.635\nAnd what we're going into is moving\nalong and working with Group Policy.\n\n5\n00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:25.215\nAnd more specifically today, we're gonna\nbe talking about Group Policy Objects.\n\n6\n00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:27.085\nAnd who better to help\nus out with that topic?\n\n7\n00:00:27.085 --> 00:00:28.445\nNone other than Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:29.655\nMike how are you doing today?\n\n9\n00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:30.795\n>> I'm doing great Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:33.075\nI'm glad to be here and\nyou're absolutely right.\n\n11\n00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:37.820\nWe're gonna be talking about good old\nGPOs or Group Policy Objects today.\n\n12\n00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.270\nSo, the first thing I wanna do is really\nlay down some basic terminology, so\n\n13\n00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.240\nthat we're all on the same page.\n\n14\n00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.270\nBecause this is a place where the\nterminology does get a little bit fuzzy,\n\n15\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.610\ndepending on who you're talking to.\n\n16\n00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.020\nIt's not that big of a deal, I think\nwe're all gonna be able to figure it out.\n\n17\n00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.419\nBut, let's all make sure\nwe're on the same page.\n\n18\n00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.210\nSo, first I want to define what\na Group Policy Object is, or a GPO.\n\n19\n00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.680\nBecause I'm gonna start shortening some\nthings up and using some acronyms.\n\n20\n00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.619\nGPO is a Group Policy Object, and\na Group Policy Object is a container.\n\n21\n00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.414\nRight?\nIt's really not a specific setting.\n\n22\n00:01:14.414 --> 00:01:18.915\nA group policy object is\na container that contains all of\n\n23\n00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:24.203\nthe different settings that I can\nconfigure using group policy.\n\n24\n00:01:24.203 --> 00:01:24.842\nLet's take a look.\n\n25\n00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:27.394\nLet me open up my screen here,\nor pull up my computer and\n\n26\n00:01:27.394 --> 00:01:29.620\nI'm going to open up\nGroup Policy Management.\n\n27\n00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.420\nAnd in here, I've got two,\nI've got my default policies.\n\n28\n00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.121\nI haven't created any new ones yet.\n\n29\n00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:40.454\nAnd I'm just going to take one of those\nguys and I'm going to right-click on it,\n\n30\n00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:41.425\nand choose Edit.\n\n31\n00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:41.993\nAll right.\n\n32\n00:01:41.993 --> 00:01:45.917\nAnd actually before I do that let's go\nback and you'll see that where I'm at,\n\n33\n00:01:45.917 --> 00:01:49.484\nin my Group Policy Management console,\nthose are the folders called,\n\n34\n00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:51.230\nGroup Policy Objects.\n\n35\n00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.688\nThis is where I can find\nthe different GPO's or\n\n36\n00:01:53.688 --> 00:01:57.352\nGroup Policy Objects that I have\navailable, or that I've created.\n\n37\n00:01:57.352 --> 00:02:00.443\nI'm going to right-click\non one of them again and\n\n38\n00:02:00.443 --> 00:02:04.650\nchoose Edit, and that opens up my\nGroup Policy Management editor.\n\n39\n00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.220\nSo the key here is to remember that\na Group Policy Object is just a container,\n\n40\n00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.960\nit's not actual settings.\n\n41\n00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.060\nIn that container are all of the different\nsettings that I can choose or\n\n42\n00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.500\nchoose not to configure, right?\n\n43\n00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.550\nSo when I open up this Default Policy,\nI see there's two halves.\n\n44\n00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.540\nAnd I'll collapse them up to make\nit a little bit more obvious.\n\n45\n00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.890\nThere's the Computer Configuration.\n\n46\n00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.960\nAnd then there's the User Configuration.\n\n47\n00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.350\nThe Computer Configuration, these are\nsettings that I would apply to a computer.\n\n48\n00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.940\nUser configuration, these are settings\nthat I would apply to a user.\n\n49\n00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.610\nSo what am I trying to do?\n\n50\n00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.260\nYou know, if you think about if\nyou apply a setting to a user then\n\n51\n00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.590\nwherever that user goes when they log on\nto different machines throughout your\n\n52\n00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.600\nnetwork that setting is\ngoing to follow them, right?\n\n53\n00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.960\nBecause you applied\nthe setting to the user.\n\n54\n00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.100\nIf you apply a setting to a computer,\nthen it's gonna be that machine, and\n\n55\n00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.040\nno matter who logs onto that machine,\nthat setting's gonna be there.\n\n56\n00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.730\nSo what are you trying to do?\n\n57\n00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.680\nIf it's a kiosk machine, then you're\nprobably using computer setting\n\n58\n00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.530\nbecause you don't know who or\nwhat's gonna log onto there and\n\n59\n00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.300\nyou want that setting to\napply no matter who logs on.\n\n60\n00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.890\nIf it's a setting that I want Wes to have,\nthen I want Wes to have that setting\n\n61\n00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.030\nwherever he goes and logs on,\nI would use a user configuration setting.\n\n62\n00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.780\nThere is some overlap.\n\n63\n00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.900\nThere are some settings that you could\ndo either to a computer or to a user.\n\n64\n00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.270\nSo you will find the setting if I\nexplore through Computer Configuration.\n\n65\n00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.170\nI might find that setting.\n\n66\n00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.020\nI go down to User Configuration, I could\nfind that same setting because I could\n\n67\n00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.740\nchoose to either apply it to the computer\nor to the user, others you won't find.\n\n68\n00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.990\nThere are some settings that don't\nmake sense to apply to a computer or\n\n69\n00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.960\nwouldn't make sense to apply to a user.\n\n70\n00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.742\nSo figuring out where these\nsetting are can be a challenge,\n\n71\n00:03:53.742 --> 00:03:58.057\nbut I'll help you out with\nthat as we move on through.\n\n72\n00:03:58.057 --> 00:04:01.209\nAll right, so let's talk about\nthe Computer Configuration\n\n73\n00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.865\nwe'll explore some of these\nsettings in here, and\n\n74\n00:04:03.865 --> 00:04:07.600\nWes these again are settings that I\ncan apply to machines on my network.\n\n75\n00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.330\n>> All right, so now if we're applying\nmachines on the network, Mike,\n\n76\n00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.770\nright now I know that I'm on your network.\n\n77\n00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.060\n>> Oh, you're in trouble now.\n\n78\n00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.060\n>> Oh yeah, and the question would be,\nI think I would have,\n\n79\n00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.250\nand maybe some of you guys have out there,\nwhen we say applying computer settings,\n\n80\n00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.300\ndo we mean just any computer?\n\n81\n00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.370\nFor instance my computer here,\n\n82\n00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.420\nor maybe somebody brings\na computer into your network.\n\n83\n00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.060\nSo when you say on the network,\ndo we have any prerequisites?\n\n84\n00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.711\nIs it any computer?\n\n85\n00:04:28.711 --> 00:04:30.744\nIs it any user?\n\n86\n00:04:30.744 --> 00:04:32.170\nSo, how does that work for us?\n\n87\n00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.204\n>> That's a great question, Wes.\n\n88\n00:04:33.204 --> 00:04:35.492\nAnd when I talk about\ncomputers on my network,\n\n89\n00:04:35.492 --> 00:04:37.789\nI'm talking about domain machines, right?\n\n90\n00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.811\nMachines that are part of my domain or\n\n91\n00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:43.854\npossibly part of my force that could be\nin a different domain in my force but\n\n92\n00:04:43.854 --> 00:04:47.500\nthey're definitely under\nour administrative control.\n\n93\n00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.210\nAs far as users go these are users that\nhave accounted an active directory\n\n94\n00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.840\nthat are logging on to those\ndomain based computers.\n\n95\n00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.480\nSo if a vendor brings their laptop in and\nneeds to connect to the network so\n\n96\n00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.670\nhe can get internet access and\ngive you some sales quotes.\n\n97\n00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.983\nNo, those policies would not apply to him,\n\n98\n00:05:06.983 --> 00:05:11.020\nneither the computer settings or\nthe user settings.\n\n99\n00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.860\nBut, like I said,\nit's a really good question.\n\n100\n00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.340\nComputer settings, when I apply\nthose to domain based machines,\n\n101\n00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.360\nthe machine has to be part of the domain.\n\n102\n00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.360\nIt doesn't matter what user logs on.\n\n103\n00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.620\nSo domain users as well as local users,\nright?\n\n104\n00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.190\nSo your user might have a laptop that\nthey use, and they come into work and\n\n105\n00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.740\nthey can log in with their work account,\nbut maybe they've\n\n106\n00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.410\nalso got a local account that they can log\non to when they're outside of the network,\n\n107\n00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.270\nwhen they take it home or\nwhatever their not doing work things.\n\n108\n00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.060\nWell those settings would still\napply to that local user.\n\n109\n00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.500\nSo your users aren't gonna be able to get\naround your settings that you're applying\n\n110\n00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.420\nwith the group policy by trying\nto log on with a local account.\n\n111\n00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.520\nThose computer settings apply to that\nmachine every time, and they're applied.\n\n112\n00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.780\nAnd here's why, there's actually\na really good, easy explanation.\n\n113\n00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.120\nThose settings are applied\nbefore the user ever logs on.\n\n114\n00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.000\nWe're gonna talk about that, that's\nan important part to understand is when\n\n115\n00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.480\nthose settings are applied, but\nI'll go ahead and give you a heads up.\n\n116\n00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.860\nComputer settings are applied\nwhen that computer\n\n117\n00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.710\nstarts up well before you\never get the log on screen.\n\n118\n00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.080\nSo it doesn't matter if you're\nlogging on with a main account or\n\n119\n00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.180\nif you're logging on with a local account.\n\n120\n00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.230\nThose settings are gonna be in place.\n\n121\n00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.792\nSo that's a great question there Wes.\n\n122\n00:06:23.792 --> 00:06:27.360\nAll right so lets take a look, lets dive\na little bit further into this GPO and\n\n123\n00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.010\ntake a look at these settings and\ncontinue on with some terminology.\n\n124\n00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.390\nI'm gonna start under\nthe Computer Configuration and\n\n125\n00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.120\nunderneath there you'll see I have\nPolicies and I have Preferences.\n\n126\n00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.248\nAnd under the user half\nI have Policies and\n\n127\n00:06:39.248 --> 00:06:42.310\nI have Preferences, and let's define them.\n\n128\n00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.050\nWe've had policies or setting, right?\n\n129\n00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.380\nYou can really interchange\nthe word policy and setting, and\n\n130\n00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.798\nthat's where it gets a little bit\nconfusing, when you're talking about GPOs.\n\n131\n00:06:53.798 --> 00:07:00.660\nI sometimes like to think of\nthe whole thing as a Group Policy.\n\n132\n00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.690\nBut that's where you've go to be careful.\n\n133\n00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:08.205\nThis whole thing, the default domain\npolicy, that is a Group Policy Object.\n\n134\n00:07:08.205 --> 00:07:13.905\nEach individual setting,\nis a policy within that GPO, right?\n\n135\n00:07:13.905 --> 00:07:16.690\nNow, I will tell you in the real world,\nit makes no difference.\n\n136\n00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:17.990\nI don't care what you call it.\n\n137\n00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.120\nAnd most of your people that you work\nwith, are going to call it a Group Policy,\n\n138\n00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.320\nand then a setting\nwithin the Group Policy.\n\n139\n00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.180\nIf you're gonna go take an exam,\nor if you want to be technically\n\n140\n00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.060\ncorrect because you're writing a paper or\nwhat have you.\n\n141\n00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.450\nThen understand according to Microsoft,\n\n142\n00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.110\nthe whole container is\na Group Policy Object.\n\n143\n00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.933\nEach setting within is a Group Policy or\na Group Policy setting, right?\n\n144\n00:07:39.933 --> 00:07:43.498\n>> One of the things I was saying,\nI know that you've been\n\n145\n00:07:43.498 --> 00:07:44.630\n>> In group policy,\n\n146\n00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.899\ngoing all the way back to 2000.\n\n147\n00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:51.612\nAnd I'm relatively, I would say\nan Active Directories lifecycle.\n\n148\n00:07:51.612 --> 00:07:53.502\nI'm relatively newer to it.\n\n149\n00:07:53.502 --> 00:07:57.227\nI didn't get into Active Directory until\n2008, so I know that you've been saying\n\n150\n00:07:57.227 --> 00:07:59.791\nterms like Active Directory,\nwe kind of lump it together.\n\n151\n00:07:59.791 --> 00:08:02.501\nBut it's interesting,\nwhen I got into Group Policy Policy.\n\n152\n00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:06.072\nActive directory as we know today\nis called domain services, right?\n\n153\n00:08:06.072 --> 00:08:09.174\nAnd then there's all these other branches,\nso it does look like it's\n\n154\n00:08:09.174 --> 00:08:11.593\nmore of a generalization when\nyou talk about that too,\n\n155\n00:08:11.593 --> 00:08:14.195\nbecause now we can't just say\nactive directory anymore.\n\n156\n00:08:14.195 --> 00:08:18.670\nWe have to say we're talking about domain\nservices, and all the other things that go\n\n157\n00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.710\nalong with active directory\nis more of an umbrella term.\n\n158\n00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.349\n>> And like I said, if you're taking\nan active Microsoft certification,\n\n159\n00:08:25.349 --> 00:08:27.566\nthen that terminology really becomes key.\n\n160\n00:08:27.566 --> 00:08:29.972\nYou've got to make sure\nyou've got that right.\n\n161\n00:08:29.972 --> 00:08:32.363\nIf we're out there working\nin the real world,\n\n162\n00:08:32.363 --> 00:08:34.826\nyou've got a little bit\nof flexibility there.\n\n163\n00:08:34.826 --> 00:08:37.857\nAll right so let's continue on with our\ninvestigation of this Group Policy Object.\n\n164\n00:08:37.857 --> 00:08:39.805\nAs I said, it's divided up into two parts.\n\n165\n00:08:39.805 --> 00:08:40.800\nYou've got your Computer Configuration.\n\n166\n00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.300\nYou've got your User Configuration.\n\n167\n00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.900\nUnderneath computer,\nI've got Policies and Preferences.\n\n168\n00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:51.010\nUnderneath user I've got Policies and\nPreferences.\n\n169\n00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.220\nAnd policies have been around\nsince we got Group Policies.\n\n170\n00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.750\nAll the way back to Windows 2000 or\nServer 2000.\n\n171\n00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.560\nAnd there's thousands of settings in here.\n\n172\n00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.690\nPreferences are new.\n\n173\n00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.860\nThese actually came out with 2008.\n\n174\n00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.610\nAnd they're fantastic.\n\n175\n00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:07.620\nI love Preferences.\n\n176\n00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.380\nWe're going to spend a whole\nepisode just on Preferences\n\n177\n00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.500\nbecause they've got some\npretty cool features.\n\n178\n00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:17.730\nBut for now, what we want to focus on\nis just the fact that they're newer.\n\n179\n00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.960\nThey're basically Group Policies,\nif we took away preferences.\n\n180\n00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.570\nWhat we had back in 2000\nwas just the policies.\n\n181\n00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:28.826\nAnd there are, as I said,\nliterally thousands of settings in here.\n\n182\n00:09:28.826 --> 00:09:34.211\nYou could do just about anything you\nwant to a machine using Group Policy.\n\n183\n00:09:34.211 --> 00:09:38.340\nAnything I can configure on a machine\nI can configure centrally using\n\n184\n00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.274\nGroup Policy.\n\n185\n00:09:39.274 --> 00:09:42.823\nBut there were some key,\noh, what's a good word,\n\n186\n00:09:42.823 --> 00:09:47.210\nthere were some missing settings\nI guess is a good way to say it.\n\n187\n00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:51.560\nThere were some things that I couldn't\ndo using Group Policy Settings or\n\n188\n00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.230\nGroup Policies.\n\n189\n00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.530\nAnd if you've been in this\nadmin business for any time,\n\n190\n00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.770\nyou can remember,\nI couldn't map network drive.\n\n191\n00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.906\nIt was very difficult to install\nprinters and things like that.\n\n192\n00:10:01.906 --> 00:10:05.240\nSo what we would do is\nwe would use scripts.\n\n193\n00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.165\nWe would create scripts that would\nrun every time that user logged on or\n\n194\n00:10:09.165 --> 00:10:12.825\nanytime that machine started up and\nthose scripts allowed us to do\n\n195\n00:10:12.825 --> 00:10:16.370\nthings that I couldn't do with\nnormal Group Policy settings.\n\n196\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.370\nThen in 2008 along came Preferences.\n\n197\n00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.060\nThese were actually developed by\nsomebody outside of Microsoft, and\n\n198\n00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.190\nMicrosoft loved them so much that they,\nI don't know the financial side if they\n\n199\n00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:32.150\nbought them or what have you, but they are\nnow incorporated into the standard GPO.\n\n200\n00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:36.698\nThese preferences, and these extend\nthe functionality of [INAUDIBLE],\n\n201\n00:10:36.698 --> 00:10:39.976\nthey basically extend\nthe things that I could do, or\n\n202\n00:10:39.976 --> 00:10:43.275\nconfigure with Group Policy Settings,\nwith a GPO.\n\n203\n00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:47.119\nSo there are things in there\nlike mapping network drives,\n\n204\n00:10:47.119 --> 00:10:50.972\ninstalling printers,\ncreating shortcuts on desktops.\n\n205\n00:10:50.972 --> 00:10:52.260\nThere's a lot of really neat things.\n\n206\n00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.123\nSo just understand for now, that policies\nhave been around forever, since we've\n\n207\n00:10:57.123 --> 00:11:01.573\ngot We've, since we have active directory,\nall the way back to 2000.\n\n208\n00:11:01.573 --> 00:11:06.403\nPreferences are relatively new,\nthey started with 2008.\n\n209\n00:11:06.403 --> 00:11:09.726\nThere are some subtle differences\nwith the way they behave,\n\n210\n00:11:09.726 --> 00:11:13.590\nbut we'll save that until we get\na little further in to our episode.\n\n211\n00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.860\n>> I do have one question there, Mike.\n\n212\n00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.460\nI have opened up a Group Policy\non my local machine, not so\n\n213\n00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:20.275\nmuch from the domain base.\n\n214\n00:11:20.275 --> 00:11:23.600\nAnd one of the things that I noticed\nis that they don't mention things\n\n215\n00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.460\nlike Policy and Preferences when\nwe're talking about local GPO.\n\n216\n00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.080\nDo you understand what that's about?\n\n217\n00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.770\nWhy don't we have Preferences on my local\nmachine when I'm looking at GPOs there?\n\n218\n00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.540\n>> Why, I'm not sure, but\nthey are not included.\n\n219\n00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:36.050\n>> They're not.\n\n220\n00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.310\n>> Yeah, Microsoft,\nthey're not part of your local policy.\n\n221\n00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:40.860\nYou'll find that your local policy,\n\n222\n00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:44.480\nif you compare the settings available in\na domain based Group Policy Object and\n\n223\n00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.190\nyour local policy, they're very simple,\nthey're almost one for one.\n\n224\n00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:51.132\nThere are gonna be some things that I can\n\n225\n00:11:51.132 --> 00:11:55.692\ndo in a domain based policy that\nI can't do on a local policy.\n\n226\n00:11:55.692 --> 00:11:59.837\nBut as far as Preferences go, those\ndo not exist in those local policies.\n\n227\n00:11:59.837 --> 00:12:01.624\n>> Oh, okay, so\nwhen it comes to Preferences,\n\n228\n00:12:01.624 --> 00:12:04.596\nif you're not in a domain environment,\nthat's why I'm not seeing them.\n\n229\n00:12:04.596 --> 00:12:07.878\nSo that is not gonna be a functionality\nthat I'm gonna see in a work group, or\n\n230\n00:12:07.878 --> 00:12:08.870\nsomething like that.\n\n231\n00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.850\nI have to be connected to\nan Active Directory environment.\n\n232\n00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:11.865\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n233\n00:12:11.865 --> 00:12:12.562\n>> All right.\n\n234\n00:12:12.562 --> 00:12:13.467\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n235\n00:12:13.467 --> 00:12:16.628\nAll right, so we said that so\nfar a computer, we've got Policy and\n\n236\n00:12:16.628 --> 00:12:17.790\nPreferences.\n\n237\n00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.930\nUnderneath User,\nI've got Policies and Preferences.\n\n238\n00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.530\nLet's go a little bit further.\n\n239\n00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.219\nSo if I go back up to Computer and\nI expand out Policies,\n\n240\n00:12:25.219 --> 00:12:29.428\nI'm gonna see I have three categories,\nSoftware Settings, Windows Settings, and\n\n241\n00:12:29.428 --> 00:12:30.904\nAdministrative Templates.\n\n242\n00:12:30.904 --> 00:12:34.502\nIf I look underneath User,\nI'm gonna see the same three categories.\n\n243\n00:12:34.502 --> 00:12:36.162\nAnd that's really what these are.\n\n244\n00:12:36.162 --> 00:12:39.437\nAs I said, there are thousands\nof settings, well over 4,000.\n\n245\n00:12:39.437 --> 00:12:40.935\nSo I mean there's a lot of settings.\n\n246\n00:12:40.935 --> 00:12:42.210\nAnd what these do is\nthese kind of organize.\n\n247\n00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:46.600\nThey help me find settings or\nthey keep those settings or\n\n248\n00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.470\ngroup policies organized within\nthe Group Policy Object itself.\n\n249\n00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.760\nSo if I know I'm looking,\nI wanna install software,\n\n250\n00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:58.470\nI can go right to my software setting I'm\nlooking for some of my Security Settings.\n\n251\n00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.500\nI know they're going to be\nunderneath Windows Settings, and\n\n252\n00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.190\nthen Security Settings.\n\n253\n00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.910\nIf I'm trying to make\nchanges to the registry,\n\n254\n00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.740\nmost of those are going to be\nunderneath my Administrative Templates.\n\n255\n00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.600\nSo these are simply\ncategories of settings.\n\n256\n00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:17.110\nAs you can see they exist under the\ncomputer configuration as well as the user\n\n257\n00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:18.390\nconfiguration.\n\n258\n00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.390\nPreferences is under both as well, we've\ngot Windows settings under preferences and\n\n259\n00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:26.820\nControl Panel setting under Preferences,\nunderneath the Computer Configuration.\n\n260\n00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.790\nWe also have Windows settings and\nControl Panel settings\n\n261\n00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:34.020\nUnderneath Preferences in\nthe User Configuration, right?\n\n262\n00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.710\nAnd as we start, let's start expanding\nthese out a little bit further.\n\n263\n00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:42.940\nUnderneath Software is where I'm\ngonna do my software installation.\n\n264\n00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.990\nWe'll see later on how I can actually\nuse a GPO to install software.\n\n265\n00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:51.390\nI don't have to run around to every\nmachine with a little disk in my hand and\n\n266\n00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.210\nsit there one at a time and install it and\n\n267\n00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:56.250\nmove on to the next machine and\npop the disk in and install it there.\n\n268\n00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.300\nI can use Group Policy\nto install software.\n\n269\n00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.260\nWe've got all of our Windows\nsettings which is where we're gonna\n\n270\n00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.370\nfind the main thing we would find\nunder here, our security setting\n\n271\n00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:10.550\neither gonna be my account policies\nlike my password policies and\n\n272\n00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.970\nmy account lock out policies,\nmy Kerberos policies.\n\n273\n00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:17.150\nI also have my local policies, my audits,\n\n274\n00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.800\nmy user rights assignments,\nmy security options.\n\n275\n00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.400\nWe've got all kinds of things.\n\n276\n00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:27.480\nRestricted groups is one that we're gonna\ntake a good look at If you can see.\n\n277\n00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.430\nAnd as I click on these, you'll see\nthese are just further categories.\n\n278\n00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:34.760\nLet me find one that actually has\nsomething interesting to look at here.\n\n279\n00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.030\nWe got a public key policy.\n\n280\n00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.330\nAnd you see underneath\nthere I've got nodes.\n\n281\n00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:45.970\nAnd if I click on EFS underneath Public\nKey Policies, there's settings out here,\n\n282\n00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.820\nor Data Protection, or\nwhat's some better ones to look at?\n\n283\n00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:54.034\nLet's go down to the user half, and\nI'll expand out Windows settings,\n\n284\n00:14:54.034 --> 00:14:59.689\nand then we'll go to Security Settings,\nand you can see public key policies.\n\n285\n00:14:59.689 --> 00:15:02.649\nSo notice there's a slight difference,\nright?\n\n286\n00:15:02.649 --> 00:15:06.886\nUnder the computer half,\nWindows Settings, Security Settings,\n\n287\n00:15:06.886 --> 00:15:12.030\nPublic Key Policies, look at all the\ndifferent options I have underneath there.\n\n288\n00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:16.198\nBut if I go down to the user half, I have\nWindows Settings, Security Settings,\n\n289\n00:15:16.198 --> 00:15:19.450\nPublic Key Policies,\ndoesn't have nearly as many options.\n\n290\n00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:24.159\nThis is where I was saying you might find\nsome similar categories and some policies,\n\n291\n00:15:24.159 --> 00:15:26.744\nremember when I say policy,\nI mean settings,\n\n292\n00:15:26.744 --> 00:15:30.089\nthat exists both under the user half and\nthe computer half.\n\n293\n00:15:30.089 --> 00:15:31.564\nBut not a lot.\n\n294\n00:15:31.564 --> 00:15:34.641\nMost of them are either in one or\nthe other.\n\n295\n00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:39.934\nYou'd either apply it to a user or\nyou would apply it to a machine, right?\n\n296\n00:15:39.934 --> 00:15:43.952\nSo let me collapse some of these up so\nwe can continue our investigation on.\n\n297\n00:15:43.952 --> 00:15:49.338\nSo underneath Windows Settings, the next\none down is my Administrative Templates.\n\n298\n00:15:49.338 --> 00:15:54.678\nAnd Administrative Templates are,\nthere's just a ton of settings in here.\n\n299\n00:15:54.678 --> 00:15:57.546\nThese are settings that make\nchange to the registry,\n\n300\n00:15:57.546 --> 00:16:00.425\nthis is how I can configure\nthe user's environment.\n\n301\n00:16:00.425 --> 00:16:02.785\nThings like, what's a good example?\n\n302\n00:16:02.785 --> 00:16:06.352\nLike if we go down into Well you\ncan see Start Menu and Task Bar.\n\n303\n00:16:06.352 --> 00:16:09.315\nI want to change that start screen layout.\n\n304\n00:16:09.315 --> 00:16:14.393\nIf I go into Windows Components I\ncan take a look at, I don't know.\n\n305\n00:16:14.393 --> 00:16:15.541\nWhat's a good one?\n\n306\n00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:16.703\nEvent Viewer.\n\n307\n00:16:16.703 --> 00:16:18.588\nOr let's see, what else?\n\n308\n00:16:18.588 --> 00:16:24.121\nRemote Desktop Services or Smart Card,\nand I can configure whether or\n\n309\n00:16:24.121 --> 00:16:30.345\nnot they have to use a smart card to\nlog on to that particular machine.\n\n310\n00:16:30.345 --> 00:16:33.610\n>> Now this is the location you\nprobably do things like Bitlocker,\n\n311\n00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.990\nWindows Update, I believe is in here?\n\n312\n00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.604\n>> Yeah, Bitlocker's in here.\n\n313\n00:16:36.604 --> 00:16:41.531\nSo if I want to configure the Bitlocker\nsettings to that operating system drive,\n\n314\n00:16:41.531 --> 00:16:44.289\nyou can see I can find\nthose settings in here.\n\n315\n00:16:44.289 --> 00:16:48.270\nSo the Administrative Templates,\nlots of settings available in here.\n\n316\n00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:51.286\nWe'll take a good look later\non on how I can find settings,\n\n317\n00:16:51.286 --> 00:16:52.775\nthere's some pretty cool.\n\n318\n00:16:52.775 --> 00:16:53.674\nWell, you know what Wes?\n\n319\n00:16:53.674 --> 00:16:55.233\nLet's just do it right now.\n\n320\n00:16:55.233 --> 00:16:56.560\n>> Okay.\n>> While we're in here, let's do it.\n\n321\n00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.071\n>> Very good.\n>> So\n\n322\n00:16:57.071 --> 00:17:00.975\nlet's say I wanted to do some Bitlocker\nsettings, but I don't know where they are.\n\n323\n00:17:00.975 --> 00:17:04.052\nI'm going to collapse some of these up so\nwe can make it look a little neater here.\n\n324\n00:17:04.052 --> 00:17:08.490\nI want to do some Bitlocker settings, but\nI don't know where they are in a GPO.\n\n325\n00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.680\nThere are thousands of setting in here.\n\n326\n00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:14.199\nSo what we're going to do is we're going\nto go down to Administrative Templates,\n\n327\n00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:16.552\nand first before I do that\nI'll click on All Settings.\n\n328\n00:17:16.552 --> 00:17:19.816\nRemember, these are categories\ntrying to make it easier for\n\n329\n00:17:19.816 --> 00:17:21.295\nus to find those settings.\n\n330\n00:17:21.295 --> 00:17:26.089\nI can click on all settings and\nget one long list of every setting.\n\n331\n00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:28.674\nLook at that scroll bar,\nteeny, tiny, right.\n\n332\n00:17:28.674 --> 00:17:34.150\nIf I look down at the bottom,\nthere's 2,003 settings in here.\n\n333\n00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.080\nVery difficult to find\nwhat you're looking for.\n\n334\n00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.956\nIf I go to the user half,\nPolicies, Administrative Templates,\n\n335\n00:17:40.956 --> 00:17:45.222\nAll Settings,\nthere's another 1,594 settings.\n\n336\n00:17:45.222 --> 00:17:47.796\nSo now we're up to almost 3,500 settings,\nand\n\n337\n00:17:47.796 --> 00:17:51.690\nthat's not counting all the Windows\nsettings and things like that, right.\n\n338\n00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.795\nSo finding a setting that you're\nlooking for can be challenging, but\n\n339\n00:17:55.795 --> 00:17:58.239\nthey give us the ability to filter these.\n\n340\n00:17:58.239 --> 00:18:01.537\nI can come in here to\nAdministrative Templates and\n\n341\n00:18:01.537 --> 00:18:05.476\nI can right click on that, and\nI can choose Filter Options.\n\n342\n00:18:05.476 --> 00:18:08.646\nAnd in my Filter Options I've\ngot a few choices.\n\n343\n00:18:08.646 --> 00:18:11.628\nWe'll talk about what they mean\nby managed in another episode.\n\n344\n00:18:11.628 --> 00:18:15.096\nLet's focus right now on just\nfinding those Bitlocker settings.\n\n345\n00:18:15.096 --> 00:18:21.836\nI choose enable key word filters,\nand I type in Bitlocker, right.\n\n346\n00:18:21.836 --> 00:18:26.530\nNow I've got a little drop down list over\nat the far right, Any, All, or Exact.\n\n347\n00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:30.610\nIs it looking for, if I had typed more\nthan one word do the results include\n\n348\n00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:34.110\nplaces where they only find one word or\nthe other word, any word, or does it have\n\n349\n00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:38.670\nto match all words, or does it have to be\nan exact match for what I type, right.\n\n350\n00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:43.240\nBecause if I type in screen space saver,\nit could find other things\n\n351\n00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:47.470\nthat have the word screen, like smart\nscreen would show up if I did Any or All.\n\n352\n00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:52.523\nIf I did Exact, it would have to\nbe screen all by itself, right.\n\n353\n00:18:52.523 --> 00:18:54.736\nSo depending on how you\nwant to filter it that way,\n\n354\n00:18:54.736 --> 00:18:56.810\nI'm going to leave it on Any for now.\n\n355\n00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.550\nAnd then where do I want to look?\n\n356\n00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:01.640\nIn the title of the setting, in the help\ntext that's associated with that setting,\n\n357\n00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.140\nor the comment and\nthe comment is kind of a cool one too.\n\n358\n00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.870\nOther admins can leave comments and\nyou can go and search for them.\n\n359\n00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:12.690\nYou might have your own system that\nyou have worked out with your other\n\n360\n00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:18.750\nadmins, and for every policy that I create\nthat has to do with the sales department,\n\n361\n00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:19.550\nI put a comment called sales.\n\n362\n00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:23.688\nSo they could come in here and\ndo a search for comment sales, and\n\n363\n00:19:23.688 --> 00:19:26.121\nthey could find all those policies.\n\n364\n00:19:26.121 --> 00:19:29.629\nI'll just go ahead and leave it on that\ndefault there with everything selected.\n\n365\n00:19:29.629 --> 00:19:30.740\nI'll click okay.\n\n366\n00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.030\nWe'll let it whir and grind a second.\n\n367\n00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:34.730\nAnd notice my list.\n\n368\n00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.791\nA few things have disappeared over here.\n\n369\n00:19:36.791 --> 00:19:42.716\nAnd when I'm looking at All Settings, I'm\nnow only seeing 46 settings, all right.\n\n370\n00:19:42.716 --> 00:19:45.090\nSo it makes it a lot easier to find.\n\n371\n00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.630\nNow all of these policies have\nBitlocker somewhere in them.\n\n372\n00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:48.810\nTake that first one.\n\n373\n00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:49.620\nYou're like, well wait Mike.\n\n374\n00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.820\nIt says encrypt the offline files cache.\n\n375\n00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.840\nWhy does that show up when I search for\nBitlocker?\n\n376\n00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.190\nWell let's take a closer look at it.\n\n377\n00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:00.062\nI'm going to double click on that guy.\n\n378\n00:20:00.062 --> 00:20:02.946\nSo it's not in the title, all right.\n\n379\n00:20:02.946 --> 00:20:04.702\nBut let's look at the Help here.\n\n380\n00:20:04.702 --> 00:20:06.834\nIf I scroll and where am I?\n\n381\n00:20:06.834 --> 00:20:07.437\nThere we go.\n\n382\n00:20:07.437 --> 00:20:11.313\nThere's the word Bitlocker\nin the Help associate.\n\n383\n00:20:11.313 --> 00:20:14.218\nSo it wasn't in the title,\nit wasn't in the comment, but\n\n384\n00:20:14.218 --> 00:20:16.605\nit is in the Help that's\nassociated with this.\n\n385\n00:20:16.605 --> 00:20:18.406\nSo now you see what those\ncheck marks can do for me.\n\n386\n00:20:18.406 --> 00:20:22.840\nDo I want to include settings where\nBitlocker's just mentioned in the Help or\n\n387\n00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.720\ndo I want it to actually be in the title?\n\n388\n00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:29.390\nIf I want to go back and modify my filter,\nI can just go back to my\n\n389\n00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.910\nAdministrative Templates,\nright click on it, Filter Options.\n\n390\n00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:33.902\nAnd I can say, you know what?\n\n391\n00:20:33.902 --> 00:20:36.206\nI want to make sure it's in the title.\n\n392\n00:20:36.206 --> 00:20:39.294\nI don't want any of those settings\nthat have it in the Help text.\n\n393\n00:20:39.294 --> 00:20:43.946\nAnd I click okay and\nnow I've gone to 12 settings, okay.\n\n394\n00:20:43.946 --> 00:20:48.256\nSo you can see how that filter makes it\neasy to find those settings that you're\n\n395\n00:20:48.256 --> 00:20:49.065\nlooking for.\n\n396\n00:20:49.065 --> 00:20:54.129\nAnd if I want to get all those settings\nback, I simply turn that filter off\n\n397\n00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:58.957\nby unchecking Filter On, and\nnow I'm back to 2,003 settings.\n\n398\n00:20:58.957 --> 00:21:02.993\nSo the filtering gives me the ability\nto find those settings within\n\n399\n00:21:02.993 --> 00:21:05.500\nthe Administrative Templates.\n\n400\n00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.531\nNow the downside is it's only\nthe Administrative Templates,\n\n401\n00:21:08.531 --> 00:21:10.850\nit doesn't help me\nfilter Windows Settings.\n\n402\n00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:13.946\nFor some reason Microsoft decided\nwe don't need to filter that.\n\n403\n00:21:13.946 --> 00:21:17.490\nAnd that's where your favorite\nSearch Engine, Google, Bing.\n\n404\n00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:18.583\nThat's a Microsoft class, right?\n\n405\n00:21:18.583 --> 00:21:20.441\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is gonna be the one we use.\n\n406\n00:21:20.441 --> 00:21:21.085\n>> Good catch.\n\n407\n00:21:21.085 --> 00:21:23.214\n>> I tell you, I do that all the time.\n\n408\n00:21:23.214 --> 00:21:27.467\nAnd there are times when I just do a quick\nsearch to figure out where that setting\n\n409\n00:21:27.467 --> 00:21:31.418\nis without actually going in and\ndoing all the filtering capabilities.\n\n410\n00:21:31.418 --> 00:21:34.940\nBut it's important that we know\nthat we can go in and filter them.\n\n411\n00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.620\nAll right, so those are my policies.\n\n412\n00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.394\nAgain, we have plenty of episodes,\nwe're gonna dive in there and\n\n413\n00:21:40.394 --> 00:21:43.460\nwe're gonna actually do some\nconfiguration and see how those apply.\n\n414\n00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.957\nBut let's continue on with\nsome terminology here,\n\n415\n00:21:46.957 --> 00:21:49.503\nget that base knowledge set in place.\n\n416\n00:21:49.503 --> 00:21:54.942\nWe've got our policies, preferences, as I\nsaid, these are newer starting with 2008.\n\n417\n00:21:54.942 --> 00:21:57.750\nAnd they give us a lot of\ncool things we can do.\n\n418\n00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:02.485\nCreating folders, creating registry\nentries, mapping network drives.\n\n419\n00:22:02.485 --> 00:22:06.875\nUnderneath Control Panel there's\na whole bunch of other things.\n\n420\n00:22:06.875 --> 00:22:11.815\nFolder Options, Network Options,\nPower Options, Printers, Scheduled Tasks.\n\n421\n00:22:11.815 --> 00:22:16.770\nI can make scheduled tasks and push\nthem out to the machines on my network.\n\n422\n00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:21.310\nAnd then we're gonna find that underneath\nthe user half, same organization.\n\n423\n00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.963\nI've got Software Settings,\nwhere I can install software.\n\n424\n00:22:23.963 --> 00:22:29.360\nI've got Windows Settings, these\nare gonna include my Security Settings.\n\n425\n00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.780\nAnd under the user half,\nFolder Redirection.\n\n426\n00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.237\nAnother very common GPO, or\n\n427\n00:22:33.237 --> 00:22:37.742\ngroup policy setting, that we'll implement\nin our network, is folder redirection.\n\n428\n00:22:37.742 --> 00:22:40.959\nAnd then of course,\nI've got my Administrative Templates, and\n\n429\n00:22:40.959 --> 00:22:42.860\nthe filtering works for here as well.\n\n430\n00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:48.730\nIn fact you'll see I can turn that filter\nback on and there aren't any settings.\n\n431\n00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:52.220\nLet's see what we were filtering it by,\nwhat group Bitlocker, so\n\n432\n00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:58.290\nthere are evidently no user based settings\nthat have the word Bitlocker in the title.\n\n433\n00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.800\nI wanted to show you that\nbecause that filter is not,\n\n434\n00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:05.050\nI right clicked up here under the computer\nconfiguration and filtered it.\n\n435\n00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.499\nWell it filters all Administrative\nTemplates in the policy itself,\n\n436\n00:23:08.499 --> 00:23:11.893\nnot just the computer configuration,\nor the user configuration.\n\n437\n00:23:11.893 --> 00:23:15.790\nSo it's the same filter, so I'm gonna\nturn that filter off and get back.\n\n438\n00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:20.538\nSo underneath the Administrative\nTemplates I've got Control Panel, and\n\n439\n00:23:20.538 --> 00:23:24.918\nI've got all my display options\nunderneath My Desktop and Network.\n\n440\n00:23:24.918 --> 00:23:26.152\nYou can just see,\n\n441\n00:23:26.152 --> 00:23:30.767\nagain, literally thousands of\nsettings that we can find in here.\n\n442\n00:23:30.767 --> 00:23:36.787\nI get down into System, Driver\nInstallation, or that Folder Redirection.\n\n443\n00:23:36.787 --> 00:23:38.221\nI mean Windows components.\n\n444\n00:23:38.221 --> 00:23:40.060\nI'm just kind of clicking around.\n\n445\n00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.600\nWhat I want you guys to do as\nyou're studying for this and\n\n446\n00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.770\nlearning about Group Policy,\njust get in here and click around.\n\n447\n00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:50.451\nYour not gonna really hurt anything.\n\n448\n00:23:50.451 --> 00:23:52.461\nBut make sure it's not in\nyour production environment.\n\n449\n00:23:52.461 --> 00:23:54.701\nI guess we should put\nthat qualifier in there.\n\n450\n00:23:54.701 --> 00:23:57.981\nDon't do this in your\nproduction environment.\n\n451\n00:23:57.981 --> 00:24:00.861\nAll right, let's see Wes.\n\n452\n00:24:00.861 --> 00:24:03.160\nNext thing we wanna talk about.\n\n453\n00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.729\nSo again, terminology wise,\nlet me just recap on that.\n\n454\n00:24:05.729 --> 00:24:12.229\nWe've got the GPO, is the container\nobject that contains everything.\n\n455\n00:24:12.229 --> 00:24:16.597\nThe settings are group policy settings or\nsimply group policy.\n\n456\n00:24:16.597 --> 00:24:18.390\nAll right.\nThat's that twisty part.\n\n457\n00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:21.220\nWhen someone says group policy,\n\n458\n00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.540\nthey're not talking the group\npolicy object, the container,\n\n459\n00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:28.420\nthey're talking about an individual\nsetting within that group policy object.\n\n460\n00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.205\nAnd then we've got the,\nwhere was I going with that?\n\n461\n00:24:32.205 --> 00:24:36.295\nWe've got the policies and preferences\nwithin that group policy object.\n\n462\n00:24:36.295 --> 00:24:37.925\nThese are ways to organize those settings.\n\n463\n00:24:37.925 --> 00:24:42.885\nIt's divided up underneath the computer\nconfiguration and then user configuration.\n\n464\n00:24:42.885 --> 00:24:46.453\nUser configuration settings\nthat apply to the user.\n\n465\n00:24:46.453 --> 00:24:51.249\nComputer configuration settings\nthat apply to the computer.\n\n466\n00:24:51.249 --> 00:24:54.450\nWe got our Administrator template,\nso we can filter down.\n\n467\n00:24:54.450 --> 00:25:00.449\nGuess the other thing was that I wanna\ntalk about was good old starter GPOs.\n\n468\n00:25:00.449 --> 00:25:02.705\nSo, let's take a look at that.\n\n469\n00:25:02.705 --> 00:25:07.410\n>> Starter GPOs are like templates or\nthey more like a, I don't know,\n\n470\n00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:09.345\nGPOs for training wheels.\n\n471\n00:25:09.345 --> 00:25:11.011\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> They're sure are, they're GPOs for\n\n472\n00:25:11.011 --> 00:25:12.100\ntraining wheels.\n\n473\n00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:16.510\nThey are templates,\nit's exactly what they are.\n\n474\n00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:22.250\nWe'll play a little more with these guys\nas we progress through these episodes.\n\n475\n00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.220\nBut you saw that there's,\nwell we counted up almost,\n\n476\n00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:29.120\nthere's over 4,000 settings in there and\nthat's a lot of settings.\n\n477\n00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:34.250\nAnd as an admin what I could do\nis I can create a starter GPO,\n\n478\n00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:35.870\nwhich as Wes said, is a template.\n\n479\n00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:40.777\nIf there are certain settings that I\nwanna make sure people include when\n\n480\n00:25:40.777 --> 00:25:43.981\nthey create new GPOs,\nI can use a starter GPO.\n\n481\n00:25:43.981 --> 00:25:47.453\nIt allows me to configure those\nadministrative templates.\n\n482\n00:25:47.453 --> 00:25:51.770\nNow the only thing in a starter GPO\nare those administrative templates.\n\n483\n00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:52.810\nYou don't get your Windows settings,\n\n484\n00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:55.580\nyou don't get your software\ninstallations settings.\n\n485\n00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:57.300\nOnly the administrative templates.\n\n486\n00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.889\nThere is the computer half,\nand there is the user half.\n\n487\n00:25:59.889 --> 00:26:04.901\nAnd I can configure settings in that\nstarter GPO, and then when somebody\n\n488\n00:26:04.901 --> 00:26:10.350\ngoes to make a new GPO, they can choose\nto base it off of my starter GPO.\n\n489\n00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.220\nAnd I would include those settings.\n\n490\n00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.700\nAnd let me give you an example.\n\n491\n00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:14.340\nAnd don't be scared.\n\n492\n00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.131\nI know we haven't really taken\na look at configuring GPOs yet.\n\n493\n00:26:18.131 --> 00:26:20.649\nTrust me, we are gonna spend\na lot of time doing that.\n\n494\n00:26:20.649 --> 00:26:24.471\nBut just to get an idea of what these\nstarter GPOs, let me go ahead and\n\n495\n00:26:24.471 --> 00:26:25.220\ncreate one.\n\n496\n00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:29.130\nSo I'm gonna go over here to starter GPOs,\nright click, New.\n\n497\n00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:32.874\nAnd I'm gonna call this I'm not very,\nI'll call this,\n\n498\n00:26:32.874 --> 00:26:35.450\nwe're able to call it, Screensaver.\n\n499\n00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:39.658\nScreensaver, oh, I cannot type today.\n\n500\n00:26:39.658 --> 00:26:45.440\nScreensaver, let's just\nstart over with that one.\n\n501\n00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.451\nNow we call it a screensaver setting.\n\n502\n00:26:49.451 --> 00:26:50.200\nYeah, right.\n\n503\n00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.057\nThen I will click OK.\n\n504\n00:26:52.057 --> 00:26:56.130\nAnd now that I've got that new starter\nGPO, I'm gonna go ahead and right click on\n\n",

They discuss how to create a GPO through the Group Policy Management Console and also through the Windows PowerShell. They talk about how GPOs are stored in two different locations inside of Active Directory and how this effects the application of policy settings. Permissions are another component of GPOs that can affect how policy settings are applied. Mike and Wes will discuss where to set permissions when it comes to delegation and application of GPOs. They show you where you can edit and link GPOs to push out configurations to users and computers in a Windows Active Directory domain",

00:00:15.764\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:15.764 --> 00:00:18.713\nin today's episode we're gonna be moving\nalong in working with group policy.\n\n5\n00:00:18.713 --> 00:00:23.049\nMore specifically, we're gonna be\ndiscussing how you create group policies,\n\n6\n00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:26.505\nand who better to do that than\nnone other than Mr. Mike Rodrick?\n\n7\n00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:28.338\nHow you doing, Mike?\nGood to see you today, dude.\n\n8\n00:00:28.338 --> 00:00:29.631\n>> Oh, it's going great,\nI'm glad to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:32.181\nWe are continuing on with our\ngroup policy, in this one,\n\n10\n00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:35.756\nwe're gonna start getting into a little\nbit more of the exciting part, right.\n\n11\n00:00:35.756 --> 00:00:37.755\nWhere we actually start to do things.\n\n12\n00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:41.574\nIn the other episodes, we kinda laid\ndown that foundational knowledge,\n\n13\n00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:45.514\nwe defined some terminology and took\na brief look at a few things, you know,\n\n14\n00:00:45.514 --> 00:00:47.871\nways we can manage them and\nthings like that.\n\n15\n00:00:47.871 --> 00:00:49.650\nBut now we're gonna circuiting it and\n\n16\n00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.980\nseeing what we could actually\ndo with these group policies and\n\n17\n00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.890\nthe first thing we need to be able to do,\nWes, is simply create them right.\n\n18\n00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.000\nWe've got to be able to make new policies\nso that's where we're gonna start.\n\n19\n00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.254\nSo let's just dive in and\ntake a look at it.\n\n20\n00:01:04.254 --> 00:01:08.897\nWhen we install Active Directory, and I'll\ngo ahead and pull up my computer here, and\n\n21\n00:01:08.897 --> 00:01:12.205\nI'm going to open up group policy\nmanagement When you install\n\n22\n00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:15.087\nActive Directory,\nyou get two policies by default.\n\n23\n00:01:15.087 --> 00:01:17.637\nI haven't created anything and\nwe can see that by,\n\n24\n00:01:17.637 --> 00:01:19.546\nHansel is thinking about loading up.\n\n25\n00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.462\nWe'll just cancel that out.\n\n26\n00:01:21.462 --> 00:01:24.590\nGroup policy console\nsometimes wigs out on you.\n\n27\n00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.270\nIt will give you that little bar that\nsays, hey console is loading up,\n\n28\n00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.810\nI have found that I can always almost\nclose that and there is nothing wrong.\n\n29\n00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.467\nAnyway, so\nin my group policy objects container,\n\n30\n00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:38.962\nhere I can see I have two\ngroup policies already.\n\n31\n00:01:38.962 --> 00:01:40.461\nAnd again, I haven't done anything.\n\n32\n00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:42.640\nAll i've done is installed\nActive Directory.\n\n33\n00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.650\nYou've got the default domain policy, and\nthe default domain controllers policy.\n\n34\n00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.420\nAnd these have some baseline settings for\nour domain.\n\n35\n00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.930\nThat default domain policy is actually\nlinked up to the domain itself.\n\n36\n00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.990\nDon't worry we're gonna\ntalk all about linking and\n\n37\n00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.730\nscoping these policies but\nit applies to the entire domain and\n\n38\n00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.630\nits got some settings that in there you're\ngoing to find your password settings,\n\n39\n00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.660\nhow long and how strong the password\nhas to be for everybody in the domain.\n\n40\n00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.663\nYou're also going to find of your\naccount lock out settings in there and\n\n41\n00:02:13.663 --> 00:02:16.879\nyour curio settings again\napplied to the domain itself.\n\n42\n00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.500\nAnd then I've got the default\ndomain controllers policy.\n\n43\n00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.754\nAnd this is actually applies to all\nthe domain controllers on my network, and\n\n44\n00:02:24.754 --> 00:02:29.336\nagain it's got some baseline settings\nthat Microsoft feels we should implement,\n\n45\n00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:32.296\nat mainly there's some\nauditing settings in there.\n\n46\n00:02:32.296 --> 00:02:35.831\nTo make sure that on our domain\ncontrollers out of the box even if we\n\n47\n00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:39.302\ndon't do anything else,\nwe've got some auditing going on, so\n\n48\n00:02:39.302 --> 00:02:41.580\nwe can go back in and see what's going on.\n\n49\n00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.462\nSo we get two policies out of the box.\n\n50\n00:02:44.462 --> 00:02:47.587\nBut of course, that's not going to\nbe enough for our organization.\n\n51\n00:02:47.587 --> 00:02:52.245\nWe wanna use group policy, we wanna take\nadvantage of the fact that I can do that\n\n52\n00:02:52.245 --> 00:02:54.588\ncentralized figuration management.\n\n53\n00:02:54.588 --> 00:02:58.310\nSo we go in and we curiate our policies.\n\n54\n00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.030\nand by far the easiest way to\ndo that is through the GUI,\n\n55\n00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.390\nright here in computer\ngroup policy management.\n\n56\n00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.206\nAnd there's several different\nways you can do this of course,\n\n57\n00:03:09.206 --> 00:03:13.022\nI can right click on Group Policy Objects\nand I can choose New and\n\n58\n00:03:13.022 --> 00:03:17.774\nI can give my new policy a name and I can\ncall it, we'll just create one called,\n\n59\n00:03:17.774 --> 00:03:20.671\nTest GPO here to start I click OK and\nthere it is.\n\n60\n00:03:20.671 --> 00:03:24.505\nThere is my new GPO.\n\n61\n00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:27.480\nSo easy enough to create that GPO there.\n\n62\n00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.230\nYou can also create GPOs\nthrough PowerShell.\n\n63\n00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.758\nAnd so if I go open up PowerShell,\n\n64\n00:03:32.758 --> 00:03:35.171\nremember I think we took\na look at this the other day.\n\n65\n00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:39.671\nIf I do a Get-Command-Module Mobile.\n\n66\n00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:40.796\nIf I can type.\n\n67\n00:03:40.796 --> 00:03:42.089\nLittle early this morning.\n\n68\n00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:46.837\nAnd then group policy.\n\n69\n00:03:46.837 --> 00:03:51.087\nI'll see all the different commands that\nI have available to work with my GPOs.\n\n70\n00:03:51.087 --> 00:03:55.720\nOne of them being, new GPO.\n\n71\n00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.119\nSo I could simply type in new dash GPO,\nand do a dash name.\n\n72\n00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.170\nAnd I'll call it Test GPO Two.\n\n73\n00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.212\nAnd it doesn't like that.\n\n74\n00:04:09.212 --> 00:04:11.128\nOh, because I didn't put\nquotes around there.\n\n75\n00:04:11.128 --> 00:04:15.286\nI got spaces in those names there,\nso I can do one of those two things,\n\n76\n00:04:15.286 --> 00:04:19.950\nI can take out the spaces or I could\nput quotes around the entire thing.\n\n77\n00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.421\nAnd then it's gonna create my GPO.\n\n78\n00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:25.059\nAnd if I go back over to my console, and\n\n79\n00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:31.171\nI refresh because these consoles don't\nrefresh automatically, there's my new GPO.\n\n80\n00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:35.030\nI got easy ways to make\nthose group policy objects.\n\n81\n00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.240\nYou can go into that graphical user\ninterface, you can right click, new GPO,\n\n82\n00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.870\ngive it a name.\n\n83\n00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.644\nOr you can go to PowerShell and\nyou can type in new-GPO, and\n\n84\n00:04:41.644 --> 00:04:43.100\nyou can give it a name that way.\n\n85\n00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.593\n>> Yeah, now Mike, one of the questions\nI have because we're dealing with\n\n86\n00:04:46.593 --> 00:04:50.773\nthe graphic user interface here in server,\nand you're also bumping over to that CLI,\n\n87\n00:04:50.773 --> 00:04:52.280\nthat command line interface.\n\n88\n00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.733\nIs there anything that's beneficial,\nmaybe GUI versus PowerShell, or\n\n89\n00:04:54.733 --> 00:04:55.770\nis it really just preference?\n\n90\n00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.504\n>> I think it's just preference.\n>> Just preference?\n\n91\n00:04:57.504 --> 00:04:58.730\n>> If you're gonna script something,\n\n92\n00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.796\nthat's when that power shell is\ngonna be a little more handy.\n\n93\n00:05:00.796 --> 00:05:06.126\nBut I will tell you that for me,\npersonally, what I've found,\n\n94\n00:05:06.126 --> 00:05:11.080\nI'd much rather go through\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n95\n00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.570\nUnless I was setting up a test domain, and\nI wanted to duplicate all of the policies\n\n96\n00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.530\nI already had, and try to script that out,\nor automate it in some way.\n\n97\n00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.110\nI typically don't find the advantage\nof trying to automate that process.\n\n98\n00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.394\nAnd I end up going back into the GUI to\nedit those policies and configure some\n\n99\n00:05:27.394 --> 00:05:32.296\nsettings in there, which I find extremely\ndifficult from PowerShell very limited.\n\n100\n00:05:32.296 --> 00:05:35.587\nSo I like to just go into the GUI.\n\n101\n00:05:35.587 --> 00:05:38.904\nAnd you know you can install it as\nwe saw in those other episodes,\n\n102\n00:05:38.904 --> 00:05:42.790\nwe can install that Group Policy\nManagement Console on my client machine.\n\n103\n00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.250\nI can sit there and I can work with group\npolicies in a nice, graphical interface.\n\n104\n00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.940\n>> If you want to automate something,\nthey want you to script something out,\n\n105\n00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.172\nmaybe doing it in bulk,\nPowerShell's gonna be the way to go.\n\n106\n00:05:52.172 --> 00:05:54.924\nBut if you're doing maybe\njust an individual GPO or\n\n107\n00:05:54.924 --> 00:05:57.100\neven a couple of GPOs on a single server,\n\n108\n00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.860\nthen maybe the GUI is probably\ngonna be a better solution for us.\n\n109\n00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.520\n>> Exactly, or\nat least that's the way I work.\n\n110\n00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.464\nAnd other people you might find that\nPowerShell works better for you for\n\n111\n00:06:06.464 --> 00:06:07.587\nwhat you need to do.\n\n112\n00:06:07.587 --> 00:06:10.668\nSo be familiar with both options.\n\n113\n00:06:10.668 --> 00:06:11.233\nAll right, Wes,\n\n114\n00:06:11.233 --> 00:06:13.505\nnext thing I want to talk about here\nis where these policies are stored.\n\n115\n00:06:13.505 --> 00:06:15.720\nSo we've created a couple policies.\n\n116\n00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.620\nNeed to understand where they're stored\nbecause I've got to make sure that\n\n117\n00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.150\nthese policies are available to\nall of my domain controllers and\n\n118\n00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.220\nwe'll talk a little bit more\nabout that replication,\n\n119\n00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.310\nif you want to get into active\ndirectory replication specifically.\n\n120\n00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.671\nMake sure you go check\nout our course library.\n\n121\n00:06:30.671 --> 00:06:34.421\nWe've got some courses in there\nwhere we discuss that in depth.\n\n122\n00:06:34.421 --> 00:06:38.906\nFor now the group policies are really\nstored in two different places,\n\n123\n00:06:38.906 --> 00:06:41.880\nthey're broken up into\ntwo different parts.\n\n124\n00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.891\nIf you will, part of it is stored in\nthe Active Directory database itself,\n\n125\n00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:49.072\nthe other part is gonna be\nstored in that sys vault, again,\n\n126\n00:06:49.072 --> 00:06:51.873\nif you're unfamiliar with those terms,\ngo back and\n\n127\n00:06:51.873 --> 00:06:55.212\ncheck out our active directory\ncourse in the course library.\n\n128\n00:06:55.212 --> 00:06:56.920\nBut let's take a look at that.\n\n129\n00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.190\nIf I switch over to server manager and I\nopen up tools and then my Active Directory\n\n130\n00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.230\nusers and computers,\nI can turn on my advanced view.\n\n131\n00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.810\nAnd when I do that I'll\nsee my system container.\n\n132\n00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.796\nAnd underneath the system container,\nthere is a policies container.\n\n133\n00:07:14.796 --> 00:07:17.087\nAnd inside their,\nyou'll see these policies.\n\n134\n00:07:17.087 --> 00:07:20.127\nNow if we would have looked before\nI created those other two policies,\n\n135\n00:07:20.127 --> 00:07:21.630\nthere would have been two in here.\n\n136\n00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.511\nWe created two additional ones, one\nthrough the UE, one through Powershell, so\n\n137\n00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:27.546\nnow you see I have\na total of four policies.\n\n138\n00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:31.392\nAll right, so if you look here,\nI've got four GPO's and\n\n139\n00:07:31.392 --> 00:07:34.212\nin that container, I've got four GPUs.\n\n140\n00:07:34.212 --> 00:07:37.813\nUnfortunately we don't see\nthat friendly name for them,\n\n141\n00:07:37.813 --> 00:07:42.309\nall we see is this globally unique\nidentifier for those group policies.\n\n142\n00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:45.699\nNow what's stored here is not much,\nin fact if you expand this out,\n\n143\n00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:48.568\nyou'll see that there's\nactually nothing under here.\n\n144\n00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:51.227\nYou can see the machine half and\nthe user half.\n\n145\n00:07:51.227 --> 00:07:53.746\nThey're empty, there's nothing in there.\n\n146\n00:07:53.746 --> 00:07:55.881\nIn the Active Directory database,\n\n147\n00:07:55.881 --> 00:08:00.519\nwhat it's really doing is just storing\nthis unique identifier for the GPOs.\n\n148\n00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:05.041\nAnd it has a way to tell when that object\nwas last modified through the properties\n\n149\n00:08:05.041 --> 00:08:06.404\nof these objects here.\n\n150\n00:08:06.404 --> 00:08:10.869\nI don't know if I can show you that, let's\nsee if I pull it up, Attribute Editor, and\n\n151\n00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:13.620\nlet's see if I can find\nthe last known parent.\n\n152\n00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:19.710\nI'd have to do a little bit of research\nand figure out what the modified date was.\n\n153\n00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:22.668\nIt might be moda, no it's not that either.\n\n154\n00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:26.475\nBut there's some properties in\nhere that describe this guy.\n\n155\n00:08:26.475 --> 00:08:30.110\nIn fact, it might be show,\nthere we go, we can see it here.\n\n156\n00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.890\nThe Attribute Editor tab has\nall the attributes right,\n\n157\n00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.220\nwhether they're listed on one\nof these other tabs or not.\n\n158\n00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.586\nBut there's that modify date.\n\n159\n00:08:36.586 --> 00:08:40.437\nSo when domain controllers\nare replicating with each other, right,\n\n160\n00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:43.634\nif I have five domain controllers,\nusers are logging on,\n\n161\n00:08:43.634 --> 00:08:46.262\nthey're gonna need to\nretrieve group policy.\n\n162\n00:08:46.262 --> 00:08:48.981\nThe domain controllers need to\nmake sure they have the latest,\n\n163\n00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:50.433\nthe correct version of that GPO.\n\n164\n00:08:50.433 --> 00:08:53.249\nSo when they replicated with each other,\nthey've gotta decide hey,\n\n165\n00:08:53.249 --> 00:08:54.690\ndo I need to replicate that policy?\n\n166\n00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.161\nIs the version you have more\ncurrent than the version I have?\n\n167\n00:08:58.161 --> 00:09:01.285\nAnd they use this modified date, right?\n\n168\n00:09:01.285 --> 00:09:05.429\nSo the only thing that's stored in\nthe database itself is the GUID for\n\n169\n00:09:05.429 --> 00:09:08.227\nthat GPO and\nthe properties about it, right?\n\n170\n00:09:08.227 --> 00:09:09.609\nWhen it was last modified.\n\n171\n00:09:09.609 --> 00:09:12.994\nSo when two domain controllers are talking\nto each other, they can decide whether or\n\n172\n00:09:12.994 --> 00:09:14.148\nnot they need to replicate.\n\n173\n00:09:14.148 --> 00:09:18.384\nHey, you've got an old copy of that GPO,\nhere's the latest version.\n\n174\n00:09:18.384 --> 00:09:21.322\nBut the settings aren't\nactually stored in here.\n\n175\n00:09:21.322 --> 00:09:24.502\nThe settings are going\nto be stored in SYSVOL.\n\n176\n00:09:24.502 --> 00:09:25.522\nRemember again,\n\n177\n00:09:25.522 --> 00:09:29.695\nreference back to that Active Directory\nset of videos that we've done.\n\n178\n00:09:29.695 --> 00:09:33.953\nSYSVOL's another part of\nActive Directory that also\n\n179\n00:09:33.953 --> 00:09:37.179\nreplicates to all domain controllers.\n\n180\n00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:41.208\nIf I scroll down here I'm\nin C: > Windows > SYSVOL.\n\n181\n00:09:41.208 --> 00:09:46.312\nAnd then I can go into SYSVOL again,\nand then my domain, lab.itpro.tv,\n\n182\n00:09:46.312 --> 00:09:50.330\nand then Policies, and\nthere's those four GUIDs again.\n\n183\n00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.793\nAnd if I double-click on one of those\nguys, now we can look in here and\n\n184\n00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:55.429\nwe'll actually see settings.\n\n185\n00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:59.754\nAnd I'm just kinda double-clicking\nkinda digging my way down in there,\n\n186\n00:09:59.754 --> 00:10:03.115\njust to show you,\nthis is where the actual settings are.\n\n187\n00:10:03.115 --> 00:10:07.712\nSo in the database you've got the GUID and\nthat last modified date.\n\n188\n00:10:07.712 --> 00:10:11.407\nBut the bulk of the GPO,\nall the settings that you configured,\n\n189\n00:10:11.407 --> 00:10:15.034\nthe settings that are going to be\napplied to all the machines or\n\n190\n00:10:15.034 --> 00:10:18.613\nthe users as they're applied,\nthose are stored in SYSVOL.\n\n191\n00:10:18.613 --> 00:10:21.506\nBoth replicate,\nthe Active Directory database and\n\n192\n00:10:21.506 --> 00:10:24.210\nSYSVOL replicate to all\nmy domain controllers.\n\n193\n00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:29.595\nBut it's just easier to store these\noutside of the database as a file.\n\n194\n00:10:29.595 --> 00:10:33.130\nIn fact, I think we can see,\nthey might even be, well,\n\n195\n00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.028\nlet's see if we can show you.\n\n196\n00:10:35.028 --> 00:10:39.973\nI'm gonna do a little View and\ndo a little file name extension on there.\n\n197\n00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:41.772\nYou see that's an INF file.\n\n198\n00:10:41.772 --> 00:10:45.024\nA little bit easier to store\nthose outside of the database and\n\n199\n00:10:45.024 --> 00:10:48.290\nreplicate them just like a normal\nfile would be replicated.\n\n200\n00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.558\nSo that's why these are put in SYSVOL,\neasy for\n\n201\n00:10:50.558 --> 00:10:53.462\nit to replicate between\nthe different domain controllers.\n\n202\n00:10:53.462 --> 00:10:57.221\nSo, create your GPOs and they're stored,\nthey're actually broken up behind\n\n203\n00:10:57.221 --> 00:10:59.927\nthe scenes and\nthey're stored in two different places.\n\n204\n00:10:59.927 --> 00:11:01.895\nNow to us, it really doesn't matter,\n\n205\n00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:04.522\nthe fact that part of it's\nstored in the database and\n\n206\n00:11:04.522 --> 00:11:08.960\npart of it's stored in the SYSVOL folder\nstructure, unless we're troubleshooting.\n\n207\n00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.031\nThat's when it's beneficial to\nunderstand where those pieces are,\n\n208\n00:11:12.031 --> 00:11:13.749\nwhere Active Directory's looking for\n\n209\n00:11:13.749 --> 00:11:17.408\nthe settings, where Active Directory's\nlooking for that version information.\n\n210\n00:11:17.408 --> 00:11:21.478\nSo if we're having trouble with domain\ncontrollers not having the latest version,\n\n211\n00:11:21.478 --> 00:11:24.255\nor not able to apply the settings at all,\nwe can go check.\n\n212\n00:11:24.255 --> 00:11:28.326\nWell, if for some reason, if I look at my\nevent logs and I'm troubleshooting this\n\n213\n00:11:28.326 --> 00:11:32.810\nclient, it's saying that it can't retrieve\nthe settings, I need to make sure SYSVOL's\n\n214\n00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:36.655\nreplicating to whatever domain\ncontroller they're logging on to, right?\n\n215\n00:11:36.655 --> 00:11:41.080\nIf it's getting an old version of the GPO,\nif the new settings I just know I just\n\n216\n00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:45.922\nchanged aren't being applied, maybe I need\nto check on that database replication.\n\n217\n00:11:45.922 --> 00:11:46.926\nAll right, so\n\n218\n00:11:46.926 --> 00:11:51.797\nknowing those things can help us do\na little bit of troubleshooting.\n\n219\n00:11:51.797 --> 00:11:54.826\nAll right, so\nwe've got creating those GPOs, and\n\n220\n00:11:54.826 --> 00:11:57.511\nthen we've got where\nthose guys are stored.\n\n221\n00:11:57.511 --> 00:12:01.817\nAnd next, Wes, is controlling\npermissions over these GPOs.\n\n222\n00:12:01.817 --> 00:12:05.392\n>> All right now, see, we've talked\na lot in other episodes and other videos\n\n223\n00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:08.998\nabout things like NTFS permissions and\nhow to lock down files and folders.\n\n224\n00:12:08.998 --> 00:12:11.529\nMike, are we talking NTFS here?\n\n225\n00:12:11.529 --> 00:12:14.779\nAnd when it comes down to it,\nI mean are, for the most part,\n\n226\n00:12:14.779 --> 00:12:16.614\nsame type of permissions apply?\n\n227\n00:12:16.614 --> 00:12:20.235\nOr these are different set of permissions\nthat are unique to Active Directory?\n\n228\n00:12:20.235 --> 00:12:21.269\n>> A little bit of both.\n\n229\n00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.769\n>> Oh, really?\n\n230\n00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:22.290\n>> How's that for an answer?\n\n231\n00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:23.033\n>> Oh, very good.\n\n232\n00:12:23.033 --> 00:12:24.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All of the above.\n\n233\n00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.388\n>> All of the above, exactly.\n\n234\n00:12:26.388 --> 00:12:28.710\nSo, we're gonna choose D\non this multiple choice.\n\n235\n00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:32.576\nThey are very comparable to NTFS,\nespecially the way they behave.\n\n236\n00:12:32.576 --> 00:12:35.931\nAnytime we're working with\npermissions in Active Directory,\n\n237\n00:12:35.931 --> 00:12:37.986\nthey work just like NTFS permissions.\n\n238\n00:12:37.986 --> 00:12:40.982\nIn the fact that we can\nset it on one object,\n\n239\n00:12:40.982 --> 00:12:45.740\nthey can inherit down to child objects,\nwe can block inheritance.\n\n240\n00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.616\nWe've got allows and denies, so\na lot like these NTFS permissions.\n\n241\n00:12:49.616 --> 00:12:54.655\nEach object is gonna have its own access\ncontrol list that we can go in and modify.\n\n242\n00:12:54.655 --> 00:12:59.038\nBut that's kind of where the similarities\nend, the permissions themselves are gonna\n\n243\n00:12:59.038 --> 00:13:01.992\nbe a little bit different than\nwhat you would see on files.\n\n244\n00:13:01.992 --> 00:13:05.656\nAnd we can apply these permissions\nin several different locations,\n\n245\n00:13:05.656 --> 00:13:07.750\ndepending on what we're trying to do.\n\n246\n00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:11.408\nWhen we're delegating out,\nwhen we want to give somebody permissions,\n\n247\n00:13:11.408 --> 00:13:15.125\nwe're really taking a portion of our\njob that we're responsible for, and\n\n248\n00:13:15.125 --> 00:13:16.666\ngiving that to somebody else.\n\n249\n00:13:16.666 --> 00:13:20.144\nI'm going to say all right,\nyou can now manage this, or\n\n250\n00:13:20.144 --> 00:13:22.447\nyou now have permissions to do that.\n\n251\n00:13:22.447 --> 00:13:25.396\nThat's what delegation is all about,\nlove delegation, right,\n\n252\n00:13:25.396 --> 00:13:28.124\ncuz I can take all of my responsibilities-\n>> And just give them to me.\n\n253\n00:13:28.124 --> 00:13:28.905\n>> And just, exactly.\n\n254\n00:13:28.905 --> 00:13:30.926\nGive them all to Wes, and\nhe takes care of them, and\n\n255\n00:13:30.926 --> 00:13:34.049\nall I have to do is follow up and make\nsure that he got those things done, right?\n\n256\n00:13:34.049 --> 00:13:38.319\nBut when we're working with group policy\nspecifically, let's take a look at some\n\n257\n00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:42.772\nof the different places that we can assign\nLine permissions, what permissions we have\n\n258\n00:13:42.772 --> 00:13:46.150\navailable and why we would,\nwhen we might choose to do these.\n\n259\n00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:51.030\nSo if we take a look at the permissions we\ncan assign on a GPO, I'm going to right\n\n260\n00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.690\nclick on this GPO and I can't get to my\nproperties like I can in NTFS, right?\n\n261\n00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.670\nSo what you have to do is\nyou select your GPO and\n\n262\n00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.320\nthen you go over to this delegation tab,\nand\n\n263\n00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.490\nhere's where you can control\npermissions over this specific GPO.\n\n264\n00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.560\nThe permissions I have available\nare going to be read, edit,\n\n265\n00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.790\nand then edit settings,\ndelete and modify security.\n\n266\n00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:13.630\nSo if I want to delegate out to somebody,\n\n267\n00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:18.305\nlet's say I want to give Wes\npermission to work with With this GPO,\n\n268\n00:14:18.305 --> 00:14:22.503\nI can find his account, and\nthen I just get a drop down list.\n\n269\n00:14:22.503 --> 00:14:25.191\nSo you can see a little bit\ndifferent there from NTFS as\n\n270\n00:14:25.191 --> 00:14:26.822\nfar as what permissions I have.\n\n271\n00:14:26.822 --> 00:14:29.376\nRead would let somebody read the policy.\n\n272\n00:14:29.376 --> 00:14:31.176\nJust like reading a file.\n\n273\n00:14:31.176 --> 00:14:34.380\nEdit settings allows you\nto open up that GPO and\n\n274\n00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.596\nmake changes to\nthe configuration in the GPO.\n\n275\n00:14:37.596 --> 00:14:41.920\nAnd then edit settings,\ndelete, modify security.\n\n276\n00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.590\nThat allows me to to edit the settings.\n\n277\n00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:48.784\nAlso, delete the GPO itself, and\nthen modify security let's me do what\n\n278\n00:14:48.784 --> 00:14:53.907\nI'm doing right now, make changes\nto who has permissions on this GPO.\n\n279\n00:14:53.907 --> 00:14:56.815\nSo if I give Wes that permission,\nmodify security,\n\n280\n00:14:56.815 --> 00:15:00.119\nnow Wes could actually come in here and\nclick add or remove,\n\n281\n00:15:00.119 --> 00:15:03.820\nand make changes to who has\npermissions over this GPO.\n\n282\n00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.630\nThese permissions effect this GPO only,\nright?\n\n283\n00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.500\nSo just that one GPO.\n\n284\n00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.560\nAnd you'd use these,\n\n285\n00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.250\nlet's say I've got a policy that I want to\napply to the sales computers, and I've got\n\n286\n00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:20.910\na GPO that makes configuration changes to\nthe computers in the sales department.\n\n287\n00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.960\nWell that sales,\nI could delegate to that sales manager,\n\n288\n00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.990\nlook you can now make your own changes.\n\n289\n00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:30.460\nInstead of having to call us up and\nI want to make a policy, I want to enforce\n\n290\n00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.890\na screen saver time out on all sales\ncomputers or I want make this change, or\n\n291\n00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:40.030\nthat change or the other, I can give that\nmanager permissions to do that himself.\n\n292\n00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.570\nRight?\n\n293\n00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:41.820\nNow they can work with it.\n\n294\n00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.090\nThey can't make changes to the other GPOs.\n\n295\n00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.390\nJust that one GPO that I've\ndelegated out to them.\n\n296\n00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.700\nAll right.\n\n297\n00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.270\nSo we can assign permissions\nover the GPOs themselves.\n\n298\n00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.330\nThe other thing we can do is we can\ngive somebody the ability to create\n\n299\n00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:55.870\ngroup policies.\n\n300\n00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.530\nAll right.\n\n301\n00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:03.650\nIf I go to the I selected the group policy\nobjects container, and I go to Delegation.\n\n302\n00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:07.350\nHere I can click Add, and\nwe'll use Wes again as our guinea pig.\n\n303\n00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:08.030\nAll right?\n\n304\n00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.830\nAnd you can see Wes.\n\n305\n00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:09.660\nIt just added him.\n\n306\n00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.710\nIt didn't ask me any questions.\n\n307\n00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:11.970\nWhat permission do you wanna assign?\n\n308\n00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.990\nBecause there's only one permission.\n\n309\n00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:19.200\nThe following groups and\nusers can create GPOs in this domain.\n\n310\n00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:25.980\nSo I added Wes in here, and\nWes can now create GPO.\n\n311\n00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.920\nThen we can also work with linking GPOs.\n\n312\n00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.520\nNow we've got an entire episode\nwe're gonna talk about linking GPOs,\n\n313\n00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:37.040\nbut just a real quick overview,\nlinking a GPO is how we actually apply it.\n\n314\n00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.680\nHow we put the policy in effect.\n\n315\n00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:44.430\nAnd to assign that permission,\nor delegate that permission,\n\n316\n00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:49.770\nwe would do it either over the domain\nitself or an individual OU.\n\n317\n00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:53.690\nLike if I go to the domain and\nI go to delegation,\n\n318\n00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.740\nyou can see I've got a couple\nof provisions I can assign.\n\n319\n00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:00.620\nLink GPOs,\nwhich is just what we're talking about.\n\n320\n00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.670\nI can also assign Perform Group Policy\nModeling and Group Policy Results.\n\n321\n00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:09.000\nThese are ways that we can go in and\nwork with group policies as far as\n\n322\n00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.730\ntroubleshooting and trying to figure\nout what settings are applying.\n\n323\n00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.430\nSomething else we're gonna\nspend a lot of time on later,\n\n324\n00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:18.100\nright now let's focus\non just linking GPO's.\n\n325\n00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:23.100\nSo if I assign Wes link GPO permission\nat the domain level, that means he\n\n326\n00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:28.030\ncan go to any one of these OU's within\nmy domain, and he can link a policy.\n\n327\n00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.520\nI could go to an individual OU.\n\n328\n00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:34.750\nAnd I could assign the link\npolicy permission here.\n\n329\n00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:40.490\nSame thing link, perform modeling,\nperform results.\n\n330\n00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:44.160\nAnd so what if I wanted Wes to be\nable to link new policies, but\n\n331\n00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.110\nonly to that G and V OU.\n\n332\n00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:50.608\nI don't want Wes linking settings\nto London, or to New York,\n\n333\n00:17:50.608 --> 00:17:53.562\nI want to limit what he's allowed to do.\n\n334\n00:17:53.562 --> 00:17:57.235\nWell instead of doing it up at the domain,\nI'll simply go to that OU and\n\n335\n00:17:57.235 --> 00:17:59.060\ngive him the link GPO permission.\n\n336\n00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.080\nSo when it comes to these permissions,\n\n337\n00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.510\nyou've got the permissions\nover the GPO itself.\n\n338\n00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:07.460\nEach GPO has its on access control list\nand I can give you the permission to read,\n\n339\n00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:12.220\nedit, or edit, delete,\nand modify security.\n\n340\n00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:17.330\nFor linking GPOs, I can do that\neither at the domain level or\n\n341\n00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:22.280\nan individual OU level to give\nyou the ability to assign a GPO.\n\n342\n00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:27.340\nMake it actually take effect, and we can\nalso give you the ability to create GPOs,\n\n343\n00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:31.680\nthat's done at the domain level for\nthat group, like where we did that,\n\n344\n00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.400\nwas at that group policy object container.\n\n345\n00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.220\nNow in a small shop,\nyou might not go through all this.\n\n346\n00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.579\nI'm the only one here.\n\n347\n00:18:38.579 --> 00:18:42.050\nI've gotta create the GPOs.\n\n348\n00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.600\nI've gotta edit the GPOs to\nconfigure the settings within them.\n\n349\n00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.760\nAnd then I've gotta link it so\nit applies to somebody.\n\n350\n00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.060\nBut in larger shops,\nwe talk about separation of duty.\n\n351\n00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.660\nAnd splitting up those permissions so that\none person doesn't have too much power.\n\n352\n00:18:54.660 --> 00:19:00.290\nBecause if Wes can create GPO's as well\nas edit them, as well as link them,\n\n353\n00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:04.900\nwell what if Wes got upset with the guys\nout there in the New York office, he could\n\n354\n00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.950\ncome in and make a GPO, edit it so that\nit did some really bad things, it made it\n\n355\n00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:13.050\nhard to work with your computer, and then\nlink it to that NYCOU and now everybody in\n\n356\n00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:16.790\nNew York City's calling up the help desk\ngoing, why don't I have a start button,\n\n357\n00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:20.830\nhow come I don't have a log off option,\nwhere's all my control panel options?\n\n358\n00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:25.560\nWes just went through and took everything\naway from him, trying to lock him down.\n\n359\n00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.538\nSo Wes would have too much\npower in that case, so\n\n360\n00:19:27.538 --> 00:19:29.077\nthat's why we might split those up.\n\n361\n00:19:29.077 --> 00:19:32.641\n>> Very good, sounds like what we talked\nabout in other security related concepts\n\n362\n00:19:32.641 --> 00:19:34.350\nis the principle of least privilege.\n\n363\n00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.520\nNow Mike, it's interesting here\nsome of these confusing terms, so\n\n364\n00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.230\nwe create a group policy object,\nit's a container but it does nothing.\n\n365\n00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.370\nInside of that object,\nis where we configure settings,\n\n366\n00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.230\nwhich are actually the policies themself.\n\n367\n00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:50.530\nSo now that we've got a group policy\nobject, you've got settings in there, or\n\n368\n00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.640\nmore rightfully so,\npolicies within the container.\n\n369\n00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:58.020\nWe've delegated the permissions of,\nwell Wes can modify or can't modify,\n\n370\n00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.270\nwe should be ready to go, right?\n\n371\n00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:03.150\nThese settings are ready to go,\nwe're ready to push them out and\n\n372\n00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:04.982\nI can take everybody's start button away.\n\n373\n00:20:04.982 --> 00:20:07.065\n>> [LAUGH] You know, you could come close.\n\n374\n00:20:07.065 --> 00:20:07.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You take that GPO and\n\n375\n00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:12.110\nyou could link it at this point,\nbecause it is an actual GPO, but\n\n376\n00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:17.490\nwhat Wes was alluding to was that we\ndidn't actually do any configurations.\n\n377\n00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.160\nI've created two test GPO and\ntest GPO2, but we didn't actually edit\n\n378\n00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.100\nthose policies, we didn't make any changes\nwithin those, the policy settings.\n\n379\n00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:30.420\nSo right now they're just a blank policy,\nthey're not gonna do anything.\n\n380\n00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.260\nAnd that's where the editing\ncomes into play and\n\n381\n00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.780\nthat's what that permission was,\nedit policy.\n\n382\n00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.000\nSo let's take a look at doing that next.\n\n383\n00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.522\nAnd don't worry, we're going to spend a\nlot of time looking at different settings\n\n384\n00:20:41.522 --> 00:20:42.842\nand how we can make these work.\n\n385\n00:20:42.842 --> 00:20:47.198\nBut just to get our feet wet,\nI want to open up one of these GPOs and\n\n386\n00:20:47.198 --> 00:20:50.280\nI'm gonna right click on it and\nchoose edit.\n\n387\n00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.783\nAnd we saw Saw this the other day,\n\n388\n00:20:51.783 --> 00:20:54.320\nwe saw that this is\nthe Group Policy management editor.\n\n389\n00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.888\nThis is how I make changes to the GPO.\n\n390\n00:20:57.888 --> 00:21:00.717\nSo here I'm working with\nthat individual GPO and\n\n391\n00:21:00.717 --> 00:21:03.759\nnow I can see all the settings\nthat are in these GPOs.\n\n392\n00:21:03.759 --> 00:21:07.240\nSo if I want to configure something,\nI need to go find the setting.\n\n393\n00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.037\nNow, these settings by default\nare gonna be not configured and\n\n394\n00:21:11.037 --> 00:21:14.770\nlet me pull one up and\nwe'll talk a little bit more about that.\n\n395\n00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:17.995\nI'll go to,\nactually let's do a user policy,\n\n396\n00:21:17.995 --> 00:21:22.834\nwe're gonna go Administration Templates,\nwe'll go Control Panel,\n\n397\n00:21:22.834 --> 00:21:26.967\nand then Display, or\nactually let's do Personalization.\n\n398\n00:21:26.967 --> 00:21:30.714\nThese are some settings that\nmost people are familiar with or\n\n399\n00:21:30.714 --> 00:21:35.950\nthey'll sound familiar, things like\npassword protect the screensaver, right.\n\n400\n00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:39.648\nWhat if I want to make sure that\nall the computers on my network and\n\n401\n00:21:39.648 --> 00:21:44.102\nthat screensaver kicks in, if you go\nwiggle the mouse though to bring it out of\n\n402\n00:21:44.102 --> 00:21:47.210\nthat screensaver,\nyou have to put in your password.\n\n403\n00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:49.765\nWell I can come in here and\nI can configure that setting.\n\n404\n00:21:49.765 --> 00:21:54.445\nSo I'm simply going to, you notice that\nthey're all not configured, every setting\n\n405\n00:21:54.445 --> 00:21:59.847\nin here, all 5,000 of them, or 4,000 some\nodd settings, start out as not configured.\n\n406\n00:21:59.847 --> 00:22:04.096\nAnd what that means is this policy\ndoesn't care one way or the other.\n\n407\n00:22:04.096 --> 00:22:07.114\nIt's not turned on, it's not turned off,\nit's just just not configured.\n\n408\n00:22:07.114 --> 00:22:12.013\nIt's not gonna do anything to a computer\nif I apply this policy to it all right, or\n\n409\n00:22:12.013 --> 00:22:13.393\nto a user in this case.\n\n410\n00:22:13.393 --> 00:22:17.968\nBut if I double-click on that\nindividual policy, that policy setting,\n\n411\n00:22:17.968 --> 00:22:21.710\nnow I can choose either Enabled or\nDisabled.\n\n412\n00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:27.950\nEnabled would turn this setting on,\ndisabled would turn this setting off.\n\n413\n00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.320\nThere's a difference\nbetween not configured and\n\n414\n00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.440\ndisabled, not configured says I\ndon't care one way or the other.\n\n415\n00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.370\nIf it was already on,\n\n416\n00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:37.480\nand I leave this as not configured,\nit's still going to be on, right?\n\n417\n00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:42.283\nIf I chose Disabled, if it was already\non and the setting says disabled,\n\n418\n00:22:42.283 --> 00:22:44.902\nnow it's gonna turn that off, right?\n\n419\n00:22:44.902 --> 00:22:49.288\nSo you see the difference between not\nconfigured and enabled and disabled.\n\n420\n00:22:49.288 --> 00:22:52.925\nNot configured says I don't care what it\nis, it's going to stay that way, Enable or\n\n421\n00:22:52.925 --> 00:22:56.430\nDisable is going to say I'm going to turn\nit on, or I'm going to turn turn it off.\n\n422\n00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:57.481\n>> Now with not configured,\n\n423\n00:22:57.481 --> 00:23:00.743\ndoes that mean let's say, that you don't\neven define a setting in this policy?\n\n424\n00:23:00.743 --> 00:23:04.785\nNot configured, does that mean that\nthe users themselves still have the option\n\n425\n00:23:04.785 --> 00:23:08.767\npotentially, cuz I know every setting's\ngoing to be a little bit different,\n\n426\n00:23:08.767 --> 00:23:11.686\nversus Disabled which means\nyou don't have the option.\n\n427\n00:23:11.686 --> 00:23:16.025\n>> Exactly, and we're gonna talk a lot\nabout the way these policies get applied,\n\n428\n00:23:16.025 --> 00:23:20.298\none of the cool things that we're gonna\nlearn about GPOs is that when I use these\n\n429\n00:23:20.298 --> 00:23:23.503\npolicy settings,\nit ends up locking the user interface.\n\n430\n00:23:23.503 --> 00:23:26.862\nAnd so if I choose Enabled or\nDisabled, it really doesn't matter.\n\n431\n00:23:26.862 --> 00:23:28.992\nIf I configure a setting using a GPO,\n\n432\n00:23:28.992 --> 00:23:32.380\nthe users aren't gonna to be\nable to change that setting.\n\n433\n00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.990\nBut hold on to that thought.\n\n434\n00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:37.449\nThe other thing that we've got to do, or\nwe gotta worry about here, Enabled and\n\n435\n00:23:37.449 --> 00:23:40.410\nDisabled, it seems straightforward,\nand for the most part it is.\n\n436\n00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:44.250\nSometimes it can be a little bit\nconfusing though, and here's what I mean.\n\n437\n00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.649\nWhen we choose Enabled we're\nturning a setting on, and\n\n438\n00:23:47.649 --> 00:23:50.771\nWindows gives us great help\nbuilt into these GPOs.\n\n439\n00:23:50.771 --> 00:23:55.321\nIn fact, if I maximize this a little bit,\nyou'll see things like if you enable this\n\n440\n00:23:55.321 --> 00:23:58.320\nsetting, all screensavers\nare password protected.\n\n441\n00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.564\nIf you disable or if you do not configure,\nthey can choose what to do.\n\n442\n00:24:02.564 --> 00:24:05.677\nThis setting also disables\npassword protected check boxes.\n\n443\n00:24:05.677 --> 00:24:08.963\nSo it's telling you exactly what's\ngonna happen if you choose Enabled or\n\n444\n00:24:08.963 --> 00:24:12.567\nif you choose Disabled, so if you don't\nunderstand what this policy's doing,\n\n445\n00:24:12.567 --> 00:24:16.480\nmake sure you read this nice help file\nthat Microsoft's built into here.\n\n446\n00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.890\nAnd the reason I say it can be confusing\nis, Disabled, again, turns a setting,\n\n447\n00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:25.540\noh, what's a good way to say it here, Wes?\n\n448\n00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.960\nIt really depends on that you've gotta pay\nattention to what the policy is saying.\n\n449\n00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.870\nLike password protect the screensaver,\nthat's pretty straightforward.\n\n450\n00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:37.720\nIf I Enable that, well that's\ngonna turn on the screensaver and\n\n451\n00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.070\nit's gonna make sure the screensaver\nis password protected.\n\n452\n00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:43.936\nIf I Disable that, it's gonna make sure\nthat the screensaver is not password\n\n453\n00:24:43.936 --> 00:24:47.860\nprotected, so if you wiggle the mouse it\njust comes right back to the screen and\n\n454\n00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.976\nyou don't have to type in your\npassword anymore, all right?\n\n455\n00:24:50.976 --> 00:24:54.586\nBut other settings\naren't gonna be as easy,\n\n456\n00:24:54.586 --> 00:24:58.580\nthere's one in here,\ndisable regedit, right?\n\n457\n00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:02.240\nOr, I'm sorry, it's prevent access to\nregedit, is the actual policy setting,\n\n458\n00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:07.570\nwell if I turn that on, if I enable\nprevent access to registry editing tools,\n\n459\n00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:13.260\nthen you're not gonna be able\nto edit the registry, right?\n\n460\n00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.200\nBut what if I disable prevent access?\n\n461\n00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.821\nThink about that for a second,\nthat's a double negative, right?\n\n462\n00:25:18.821 --> 00:25:23.447\nIf I disable or prevent access,\nI'm actually making sure you do have\n\n463\n00:25:23.447 --> 00:25:27.216\naccess to registry editing tools,\nsee how that works?\n\n464\n00:25:27.216 --> 00:25:33.490\nSo by disabling that policy, I'm giving\nyou access to registry editing tools.\n\n465\n00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.750\nAnd you might think, well wait,\nwhat the heck, that doesn't make sense.\n\n466\n00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:40.504\nAnd it really has to do with\nthe way policies are applied,\n\n467\n00:25:40.504 --> 00:25:44.860\nand we're gonna talk more\nabout this as we break down\n\n468\n00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:50.410\nthe Group Policy application,\nbut for now, imagine this.\n\n469\n00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:54.327\nI've got a policy, I don't want anybody\nin the domain editing the registry.\n\n470\n00:25:54.327 --> 00:25:57.081\nSo at the domain level I create a policy,\n\n471\n00:25:57.081 --> 00:26:00.900\nand I enable prevent access\nto registry editing tools.\n\n472\n00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.425\nAll right, that's gonna make sure\nthat nobody in the network can\n\n473\n00:26:04.425 --> 00:26:06.232\nuse the registry editing tools.\n\n474\n00:26:06.232 --> 00:26:10.467\nBut now my IT people, they need\naccess to registry editing tools.\n\n475\n00:26:10.467 --> 00:26:15.133\nSo I take it away from everybody, but\nthen I can create another policy that\n\n476\n00:26:15.133 --> 00:26:17.926\ngives it back to just the IT people,\nright?\n\n477\n00:26:17.926 --> 00:26:22.332\nThat's when I would need to disable,\ncuz they're already prevented access,\n\n478\n00:26:22.332 --> 00:26:27.068\nthat enable the prevent access to registry\nediting tools, that applies to everybody\n\n479\n00:26:27.068 --> 00:26:30.770\nincluding my IT people, so\nthey don't have access at this point.\n\n480\n00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:31.876\nSo to reverse that,\n\n481\n00:26:31.876 --> 00:26:36.239\nthat's when I can disable prevent access\nto registry editing tools which now is\n\n482\n00:26:36.239 --> 00:26:40.620\ngonna give them access to registry editing\ntools, does that make sense at all?\n\n483\n00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.660\n>> Yeah, it does, boy, I'll tell you what,\nthat's very confusing too.\n\n484\n00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:47.355\nAll right Mike, well we've got a lot of\ngood stuff that we've talked about, we\n\n485\n00:26:47.355 --> 00:26:51.179\ntalked about creation of a group policy,\nwe talked about the storage locations.\n\n486\n00:26:51.179 --> 00:26:55.355\nRemember, two different locations, one in\nactive directory, one in the SYSVOL and\n\n487\n00:26:55.355 --> 00:26:59.183\neven if you're just kinda learning this,\nthat's really good [INAUDIBLE] when\n\n488\n00:26:59.183 --> 00:27:02.320\nit comes to maybe why one of your\npolicies might not be applying.\n\n489\n00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.152\nWe've been talking about delegation and\npermissions, and we also talked about\n\n490\n00:27:06.152 --> 00:27:09.437\nediting, so all good stuff Mike,\ndo you got anything else here sir?\n\n491\n00:27:09.437 --> 00:27:14.189\n>> The one other thing I wanna\nmention to you is if I come in and\n\n492\n00:27:14.189 --> 00:27:18.941\nconfigure a setting, and\nI click OK on that setting, and\n\n493\n00:27:18.941 --> 00:27:21.626\nthen I close my editor, right.\n\n494\n00:27:21.626 --> 00:27:24.656\nNotice I never saved it, I never clicked,\nthere was no file save or anything like\n\n495\n00:27:24.656 --> 00:27:27.865\nthat, one thing you've gotta be aware of\nwhen you're working with group policies,\n\n496\n00:27:27.865 --> 00:27:29.140\nthey're saved automatically.\n\n497\n00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:34.260\nSo any changes that you make, when you're\nin that Group Policy management editor,\n\n498\n00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.980\nyou don't have to commit the changes,\nthere's no apply button,\n\n499\n00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.420\nthere's no save button, whatever you do,\nit's automatically saved.\n\n500\n00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.910\nSo another thing you should keep in mind.\n\n501\n00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.201\n>> Well it looks like we've come\nto the end of this episode,\n\n502\n00:27:45.201 --> 00:27:47.852\nbut stick around because we've\ngot more Group Policy coming up.\n\n503\n00:27:47.852 --> 00:27:51.661\nBut, until we see you next time signing\noff for ITPro.TV, I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n504\n00:27:51.661 --> 00:27:52.404\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n505\n00:27:52.404 --> 00:27:54.098\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n506\n00:27:54.098

episode\nat ITPro TV, I'm your host Wes Brian.\n\n4\n00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.940\nIn today's episode we're gonna be moving\nalong with working with group policy.\n\n5\n00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.283\nAnd, today we're gonna be talking about\nadministrative templates and who better to\n\n6\n00:00:23.283 --> 00:00:27.105\na, I guess there's nobody better to\nshow us this then Mr. Mike Roderick.\n\n7\n00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:28.189\nHow you doing today Mike?\n>> Oh, I'm doing great and\n\n8\n00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.083\nI don't know about that I'm sure there are\nsome people out there that do this a lot\n\n9\n00:00:31.083 --> 00:00:31.735\nbetter then I do.\n\n10\n00:00:31.735 --> 00:00:34.494\nHopefully I can get you\nthrough what we need to know\n\n11\n00:00:34.494 --> 00:00:37.265\nabout these good old\nadministrative templates.\n\n12\n00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:39.501\nAnd first of all let's start there,\n\n13\n00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:43.265\nwhat the heck is he talking\nabout administrative templates?\n\n14\n00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.030\nLet's open up my group policy management\nconsole and just take a look.\n\n15\n00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.720\nI'm going to go dive into group policy and\nI'm going to take one of those GPOs we\n\n16\n00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.490\nmade in a previous episode and I'm going\nto right-click on it and choose Edit.\n\n17\n00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.383\nAnd we've already seen in that\ngroup policy management editor,\n\n18\n00:00:59.383 --> 00:01:01.390\nthat it's kind of divided\nup into sections.\n\n19\n00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.998\nIt's not one big long\nlist of 4,000+ settings.\n\n20\n00:01:02.998 --> 00:01:05.684\nIt's divided up,\nI've got my computer configuration and\n\n21\n00:01:05.684 --> 00:01:07.250\nI've got my user configuration.\n\n22\n00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.014\nWithin each one of those I've got\npolicies and preferences, and\n\n23\n00:01:11.014 --> 00:01:16.081\nthen within each one of those underneath\nlike policies, I've got software settings,\n\n24\n00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:20.070\nWindows settings and\nthen administrative templates right?\n\n25\n00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.090\nUnderneath the computer half I have\nsoftware settings, Windows settings,\n\n26\n00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.370\nand then administrative templates.\n\n27\n00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.660\nAnd these administrative\ntemplates are registry settings.\n\n28\n00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.770\nThese are places where I can go in and I\ncan make changes to those remote machines,\n\n29\n00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.170\nyou know all those machines in my network.\n\n30\n00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.700\nI can make changes in their registry using\nthese administrative templates, all right?\n\n31\n00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.610\nAnd there are, as we've seen already,\n\n32\n00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.900\nif I go down to the user configuration\nthere's 1,594 settings in there.\n\n33\n00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.830\nIf I go back up to the computer\nconfiguration, got another 2,003 settings.\n\n34\n00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.150\nSo there is no shortage of\nconfiguration changes I\n\n35\n00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.940\ncan make to these client machines.\n\n36\n00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.880\nNow these administrative templates,\nwhere do these settings come from?\n\n37\n00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.635\nWell, they're actually\nstored in ADMX files.\n\n38\n00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:19.360\nThere's a set of files that gives us\nthese settings, this is why they show up.\n\n39\n00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.460\nAnd we're gonna learn all\nabout these files today.\n\n40\n00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.128\nIt is a relatively new 2008\nWindows Vista is kind of when they made\n\n41\n00:02:26.128 --> 00:02:28.310\nthe switch to these ADMX files.\n\n42\n00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.547\nPrior to that they were known\nas ADM files, short for\n\n43\n00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:33.840\nadministrative template, right?\n\n44\n00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.432\nBut now they're known as ADMX files.\n\n45\n00:02:39.432 --> 00:02:42.480\n>> All right,\nnow I know Vista brought a lot of changes.\n\n46\n00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.349\nI mean, you look at all the different\nformat changes, architecture change,\n\n47\n00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.060\nboot change.\n\n48\n00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.070\nSo, why did they add the X?\n\n49\n00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.520\nJust one extra letter here?\n\n50\n00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.064\n>> Absolutely, we wanna make\neverything four letter extensions,\n\n51\n00:02:53.064 --> 00:02:54.416\nthat's the whole trying to make.\n\n52\n00:02:54.416 --> 00:02:55.720\nNo, just kidding.\n\n53\n00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.310\nPrior to this,\n\n54\n00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.900\nwhen they were just ADM files,\nthey were very difficult to work with.\n\n55\n00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.740\nThey were written in a language that,\n\n56\n00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.310\nMicrosoft's own markup language for\nthese administrative templates.\n\n57\n00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.870\nAnd if you want to go in and\n\n58\n00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.896\nmake changes to them, you really\nneeded to learn their markup language.\n\n59\n00:03:12.896 --> 00:03:15.040\nIt was difficult to work with.\n\n60\n00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.710\nWith the ADMX format, they went to XML.\n\n61\n00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.540\nIt's like all of our Office documents,\n\n62\n00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.660\nMicrosoft Office kind of changed from\n.doc to .docx cuz they're now XML.\n\n63\n00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.940\nIt's the same thing with these.\n\n64\n00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.150\nAnd XML is a well known mark up language\nand it's really easy to work with.\n\n65\n00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.800\nSo, that was the big push, one of\nthe big reasons we have this change.\n\n66\n00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.006\nWe went from the ADM to\nthe ADMX because when it's out,\n\n67\n00:03:38.006 --> 00:03:40.300\nit's a lot easier to modify.\n\n68\n00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.160\nWe can go in and actually tweak these\nadministrative templates if we want to.\n\n69\n00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.258\nAnd these administrative templates,\nthe other part of the ADMX,\n\n70\n00:03:48.258 --> 00:03:50.759\nis they actually broke them\nup into two parts, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:54.310\nWhereas when they were ADM\nfiles they were just one file.\n\n72\n00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.830\nI won't say one file but\neach policy basically,\n\n73\n00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.180\neach policy setting was\nan individual file.\n\n74\n00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.340\nNow with ADMX we're gonna see that\nthere are two files associated with it.\n\n75\n00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:13.680\nThere's the ADMX file itself,\nand there's an ADML file, right?\n\n76\n00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.560\nThe ADMX, A-D-M-X if I can say\nthat is the language neutral file.\n\n77\n00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.170\nAnd this is what the ADMX file what\n\n78\n00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.160\ntells the computer what change\nto make in the Registry.\n\n79\n00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.155\nFor example, if we go and\nturn that GPO on, let's say we go in and\n\n80\n00:04:28.155 --> 00:04:31.780\nwe set the screen saver time out to ten\nminutes, because I can do that in a GPO.\n\n81\n00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.650\nIn fact let's go find it.\n\n82\n00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.596\nIf I go to administrative templates,\ncontrol panel,\n\n83\n00:04:37.596 --> 00:04:41.560\npersonalization, here's\nmy screen saver time out.\n\n84\n00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.557\nAnd I can open up this setting and,\nI can enable it and\n\n85\n00:04:46.557 --> 00:04:51.110\nI can set that value to whatever I want,\nright.\n\n86\n00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.916\nThat's gonna be in seconds so\n600, that'd be divided by 6,\n\n87\n00:04:54.916 --> 00:04:57.515\n10 minutes right, if my math is correct?\n\n88\n00:04:57.515 --> 00:04:59.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's really tricky to do on camera.\n\n89\n00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.960\nSo, I can set that to 600 seconds.\n\n90\n00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.260\nWell when this policy applies, let's say\nyou log on to your Windows 10 machine.\n\n91\n00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:11.370\nAnd it pulls this policy down and\napplies it, how does it know what to do?\n\n92\n00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.308\nBecause the ADMX file is gonna tell\nit what key in the registry that it's\n\n93\n00:05:16.308 --> 00:05:19.780\ntrying to modify and\nwhat value to set that key to.\n\n94\n00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.760\nSo that's what that ADMX file is.\n\n95\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.060\nThe ADMX file is what tells\nit how to apply that setting.\n\n96\n00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.860\nWhat key, whether it needs to be,\nthe key needs to be created, or\n\n97\n00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.940\nwhether you just find the key, and\nthen what value to set that key to.\n\n98\n00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.600\nSo that's language independent,\n\n99\n00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.370\nor language neutral,\nis what they like to say.\n\n100\n00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.700\nThen there's the ADML file.\n\n101\n00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.320\nEvery ADMX file has a matching ADML file.\n\n102\n00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.370\nAnd the ADML file is\nthe language specific file.\n\n103\n00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.857\nAll the other stuff that I'm\nseeing right here on my screen,\n\n104\n00:05:53.857 --> 00:05:59.236\nall of this help text,\nall of the title of the dialogue box,\n\n105\n00:05:59.236 --> 00:06:02.690\nall the text, is in English, right?\n\n106\n00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.810\nThat's from that ADML file.\n\n107\n00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.420\nI have an en-us set of ADML files.\n\n108\n00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.928\nBut what if I've got an office in Madrid,\nand\n\n109\n00:06:09.928 --> 00:06:13.493\nthose administrators over there\nwanna work with group policy,\n\n110\n00:06:13.493 --> 00:06:17.860\nI wanna give them the ability to go in and\ncreate policies and things like that.\n\n111\n00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.900\nIt would probably be easier for\nthem it was in their language, right?\n\n112\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.295\nI can simply go out and\nreplace those en-us files,\n\n113\n00:06:25.295 --> 00:06:31.340\nthose ADML files that are in English,\nwith ADML files that are in Spanish.\n\n114\n00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.925\nNow all of this language, all of this text\nwill be in Spanish instead of English.\n\n115\n00:06:35.925 --> 00:06:39.275\nIt doesn't change what key\nI'm changing in the registry.\n\n116\n00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:42.226\nIt's still the same registry key that\naffects the screen saver timeout,\n\n117\n00:06:42.226 --> 00:06:45.665\nit's still setting that value to that key,\nso the ADMX file doesn't have to change.\n\n118\n00:06:45.665 --> 00:06:48.195\nSo you see what we've done?\n\n119\n00:06:48.195 --> 00:06:53.355\nWe've split the setting and\nthe language into two separate pieces.\n\n120\n00:06:53.355 --> 00:06:58.157\nSo now I can easily change what language\nI'm working in without modifying\n\n121\n00:06:58.157 --> 00:06:59.480\nthose other files.\n\n122\n00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.060\nAnd, [COUGH], excuse me,\nthat is why Microsoft did that.\n\n123\n00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.120\nSo it makes it really easy to work with.\n\n124\n00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.410\nAnd let's go take a look at those files.\n\n125\n00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.495\nIf I open up File Explorer\non this Domain Controller,\n\n126\n00:07:13.495 --> 00:07:17.760\nby default they're gonna be located\nC:\\Windows Policy definitions.\n\n127\n00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.751\nAnd in here you're gonna see all\nof these different ADMX files.\n\n128\n00:07:22.751 --> 00:07:26.423\nAnd you'll recognize some of the names\nof these files, some of them you won't,\n\n129\n00:07:26.423 --> 00:07:27.557\ncontrol panel, right?\n\n130\n00:07:27.557 --> 00:07:32.210\nThose are probably settings that I can\nconfigure on that client's control panel.\n\n131\n00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.370\nDesktop settings, device setup, right?\n\n132\n00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.420\nFolder redirection settings.\n\n133\n00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:45.480\nAll of those things that we see were\nin that group policy management header.\n\n134\n00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.616\nAll of these settings right\nhere that I can configure,\n\n135\n00:07:48.616 --> 00:07:51.350\nthose are defined in these ADMX files,\nright.\n\n136\n00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.876\nAnd, at the very top of this\nlist is a sub folder for en-us.\n\n137\n00:07:55.876 --> 00:07:58.813\nAnd if we open this guy up,\nlet's do this, Wes.\n\n138\n00:07:58.813 --> 00:08:02.680\nLet's say, let's see if I can\nget it to play along with me.\n\n139\n00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.826\nHere.\n\n140\n00:08:03.826 --> 00:08:09.131\nNow if we do this, we could actually\nsee that for every admx file,\n\n141\n00:08:09.131 --> 00:08:16.376\nActiveXInstallService.admx, there's\na matching ActiveXInstallService.adml.\n\n142\n00:08:16.376 --> 00:08:20.539\nAutoPlay.admx, AutoPlay.adml.\n\n143\n00:08:20.539 --> 00:08:23.606\nSo you've got the setting file,\nwhat describes how and\n\n144\n00:08:23.606 --> 00:08:26.422\nwhere in the registry to\nmake this configuration.\n\n145\n00:08:26.422 --> 00:08:29.561\nAnd the you've got the language file,\nwhich is all the other stuff,\n\n146\n00:08:29.561 --> 00:08:31.903\nthe help tabs, the titles,\nand things like that.\n\n147\n00:08:31.903 --> 00:08:34.804\n>> Now, you've got en-US here.\n\n148\n00:08:34.804 --> 00:08:39.353\nThe starting adml files, is that really\ncontingent on, for instance the language\n\n149\n00:08:39.353 --> 00:08:43.264\nof the base install of the server,\nif you will, is that how that works?\n\n150\n00:08:43.264 --> 00:08:44.401\nAt least as the starting point?\n\n151\n00:08:44.401 --> 00:08:46.073\n>> That is exactly right.\n\n152\n00:08:46.073 --> 00:08:49.287\nWhen you install your server operating\nsystem and you choose your language as\n\n153\n00:08:49.287 --> 00:08:52.508\nyou're going through set up, that's\nhow it knows what to pack out, right?\n\n154\n00:08:52.508 --> 00:08:56.403\nIf you've got that multi-language\ninstall media, you can choose\n\n155\n00:08:56.403 --> 00:09:00.791\na different install language and\nthat would by default then include those.\n\n156\n00:09:00.791 --> 00:09:03.182\nAnd you can always go ahead and\ndownload it from Microsoft as well.\n\n157\n00:09:03.182 --> 00:09:07.824\nIf I didn't have a multi-lingual setup and\nI just a needed a group policy to be\n\n158\n00:09:07.824 --> 00:09:11.967\nin Spanish, I could go out and\nget those ADML files from Microsoft and\n\n159\n00:09:11.967 --> 00:09:16.780\nI could just dump them in here and\nit would take advantage of that.\n\n160\n00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:17.810\nAll right.\n\n161\n00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.020\nSo lots of settings again broken\nup into two different parts.\n\n162\n00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.965\nAnd let's take a look, let's find one,\nI'll give you another look at this.\n\n163\n00:09:24.965 --> 00:09:30.992\nControlPanelDisplay.admx, let me\ngo ahead and open that guy up.\n\n164\n00:09:30.992 --> 00:09:37.820\nThere it is, and I'm gonna find that\nControlPanelDisplay.adml as well.\n\n165\n00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:44.460\nAnd I'll kind of arrange these guys so\nwe can see them both here, right?\n\n166\n00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.450\nSo up at the top, that's the ADMX file,\nthat's where the actual configuration\n\n167\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:53.000\nsetting is, but what it does to the\nRegistry an the bottom is that ADML file.\n\n168\n00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.355\nAnd if we find one, we'll see if I can\nfind one for us that's easy to recognize,\n\n169\n00:09:57.355 --> 00:09:58.930\nall right?\n\n170\n00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:04.536\nSo, in my ADMX file, here's a policy\nname CPL_Display_Disable, right?\n\n171\n00:10:04.536 --> 00:10:09.172\nSo it's gonna give you the ability\nto turn off the display options in\n\n172\n00:10:09.172 --> 00:10:10.563\nthe control panel.\n\n173\n00:10:10.563 --> 00:10:16.810\nAnd then for the displayName it simply\nsays string.CPL_Display_Disable.\n\n174\n00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:21.951\nAnd then for the explainText, it simply\nsays string.CPL_Display_Disable_Help.\n\n175\n00:10:21.951 --> 00:10:26.466\nDown below there here's the key,\nright, this is the key in the registry\n\n176\n00:10:26.466 --> 00:10:30.880\nthat's going to be modified if\nI turn this on or disable it.\n\n177\n00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.150\nHere's the value that it's gonna set,\nNoDispCPL, right?\n\n178\n00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.626\nSo again these are the instructions for\n\n179\n00:10:36.626 --> 00:10:41.582\nwhat to do if this setting is\nbeing applied to a machine.\n\n180\n00:10:41.582 --> 00:10:45.494\nDown below is the actual language file,\nright?\n\n181\n00:10:45.494 --> 00:10:53.236\nSo here where it says the\ndisplayName=\"$(string.CPL_Display_Disab-\n\n182\n00:10:53.236 --> 00:11:01.639\nle)\", in the ADML file I've got this strig\nid=\"CPL_Display_Disable\" right here.\n\n183\n00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:08.706\nAnd here is the actual text,\nDisable the Display Control Panel.\n\n184\n00:11:08.706 --> 00:11:14.380\nSo, you see the ADML file is just saying\nhey, go find this in the ADML file.\n\n185\n00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.667\nThat'll tell you what to put for\ndisplay name.\n\n186\n00:11:17.667 --> 00:11:21.460\nAnd then it says for the explain text,\ngo look at the ADML file for\n\n187\n00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.129\nsomething called\nstring.CPL_Display_Disable_Help.\n\n188\n00:11:25.129 --> 00:11:27.100\nWell, here it is,\nCPL_Display_Disable_Help.\n\n189\n00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.490\nAnd then here's all that help\nfile information that we see\n\n190\n00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.708\non the side of that window when I\ndouble click on those settings.\n\n191\n00:11:33.708 --> 00:11:36.385\nTechnically I could come in here and\n\n192\n00:11:36.385 --> 00:11:39.654\nI could modify this ADML file and\nput Mike was here.\n\n193\n00:11:39.654 --> 00:11:42.236\nRight?\nAnd leave somebody a little Where's Waldo\n\n194\n00:11:42.236 --> 00:11:42.962\ntype thing.\n\n195\n00:11:42.962 --> 00:11:48.052\nAnd you could actually change what text is\nappearing when you open up those settings.\n\n196\n00:11:48.052 --> 00:11:48.958\nSo that's how it works.\n\n197\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.676\nThere's two sets of files.\n\n198\n00:11:50.676 --> 00:11:54.816\nThere's the ADMX file, which defines\nhow to make the change in the registry\n\n199\n00:11:54.816 --> 00:11:57.736\nwhen that setting is applied\nto a machine or to a user.\n\n200\n00:11:57.736 --> 00:12:00.709\nWhat key to set, what value to set it to.\n\n201\n00:12:00.709 --> 00:12:04.484\nAnd then there's the ADML files\nwhich is a language portion,\n\n202\n00:12:04.484 --> 00:12:08.710\nwhich is all the explained text,\nthe title bar and things like that.\n\n203\n00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:09.244\n>> Very good.\n\n204\n00:12:09.244 --> 00:12:14.458\nNow, question, with all these four\ngazillion settings that we can set inside\n\n205\n00:12:14.458 --> 00:12:19.356\nof a group policy, is there a time when\nmaybe when it comes to settings that\n\n206\n00:12:19.356 --> 00:12:24.649\nthere are certain settings or maybe\ntechnologies that maybe we wanna control,\n\n207\n00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:27.098\nthat they're not there by default?\n\n208\n00:12:27.098 --> 00:12:27.864\n>> Absolutely.\n\n209\n00:12:27.864 --> 00:12:30.350\nYou know that's one of the great\nthings about this format.\n\n210\n00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.879\nI can make my own administrator template.\n\n211\n00:12:32.879 --> 00:12:36.347\nIf I have a program that\nneeds a registry setting for\n\n212\n00:12:36.347 --> 00:12:40.393\nit to work properly in all my machines,\nI can create my own.\n\n213\n00:12:40.393 --> 00:12:41.763\nIt's simple XML.\n\n214\n00:12:41.763 --> 00:12:43.993\nI can take one of those existing files and\n\n215\n00:12:43.993 --> 00:12:46.820\nkinda figure out what\nexactly they've got there.\n\n216\n00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.630\nAnd I could make my own.\n\n217\n00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.097\nBasically it wouldn't be that difficult.\n\n218\n00:12:51.097 --> 00:12:55.822\nYou gotta define what registry\nkey to create or to modify and\n\n219\n00:12:55.822 --> 00:12:58.857\nthen what you wanna set that value to.\n\n220\n00:12:58.857 --> 00:13:03.432\nYou'd create a matching ADML file,\nif you wanted help text over there,\n\n221\n00:13:03.432 --> 00:13:04.720\nit's very easy.\n\n222\n00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.260\nThat's one of the reasons\nthey went to XML.\n\n223\n00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.495\nIs to make it much easier for\nus to go in and modify.\n\n224\n00:13:10.495 --> 00:13:16.010\nBecause I remember installing,\nat a place I used to work, and\n\n225\n00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:22.110\nwe needed a registry setting to make\nit work properly in our environment.\n\n226\n00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.420\nI simply made a new ADMX file and\n\n227\n00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:28.010\nwas able to then configure that\nusing group policy, right?\n\n228\n00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.140\nI can now control that\nprogram through group policy.\n\n229\n00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.190\nSo, very, very extensible.\n\n230\n00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.260\nAnd, other companies can take\nadvantage of that, as well.\n\n231\n00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:38.170\nFor example, if we look in our\nAdministrative Templates here,\n\n232\n00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.620\nthere are no settings for office.\n\n233\n00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.180\nRight?\nIf we go down to All Settings, and\n\n234\n00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:43.930\nI won't.\n\n235\n00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.080\nWell, actually, you know what?\n\n236\n00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.010\nWe can use our handy-dandy\nfilter capabilities.\n\n237\n00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:48.705\nSo we'll do a filter on.\n\n238\n00:13:48.705 --> 00:13:50.679\nRemember we learned about\nthis the other day.\n\n239\n00:13:50.679 --> 00:13:55.624\nAnd I look for office,\nAny, and I click OK.\n\n240\n00:13:55.624 --> 00:13:59.865\nAnd it looks like I might have a couple\nof settings, Browse common web sites to\n\n241\n00:13:59.865 --> 00:14:03.660\nfind printers, Redirect folders\non primary commuters only.\n\n242\n00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.180\nWhere the heck does office even show up?\n\n243\n00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:06.680\nLet's see.\n\n244\n00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:12.055\nIt's gotta be in the help text somewhere,\nis the word office.\n\n245\n00:14:12.055 --> 00:14:16.820\n[SOUND] Meeting room computer or\nin remote office, right?\n\n246\n00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.867\nSo there are no settings in here\nthat have to deal with the software,\n\n247\n00:14:20.867 --> 00:14:23.503\nMicrosoft Office 2013, for example.\n\n248\n00:14:23.503 --> 00:14:25.350\nOkay, but what if I wanna control\nthat through group policy?\n\n249\n00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:27.100\nI can go out to Microsoft and\n\n250\n00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:32.790\nI can download a set of ADMX\nfiles to control Office.\n\n251\n00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.350\nIn fact, I've already done that.\n\n252\n00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.430\nSurprise, surprise.\n\n253\n00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:39.100\nIf I open up File Explorer and\nI take a look at my Downloads,\n\n254\n00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.610\nhere's what I downloaded from Microsoft,\nadmintemplates_64.\n\n255\n00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.460\nI then extracted those out, and\n\n256\n00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.740\nnow I've got this folder here that\nI've renamed Office 2013 ADMx.\n\n257\n00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.380\nInside there is a folder called admx.\n\n258\n00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.910\nInside there is all these\nadditional ADMX files.\n\n259\n00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:03.550\nFor Excel, for One Note,\nfor Word, for Vizio.\n\n260\n00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:07.030\nNotice there's also some\nlanguage folders up here.\n\n261\n00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:10.890\nSo depending on what language I want,\nI can go into en-US and\n\n262\n00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:14.380\nthere's the matching ADML files for\nthose ADMX files for Office.\n\n263\n00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.440\nAnd watch how easy it is to extend\nmy group policy functionality.\n\n264\n00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.743\nI'm simply gonna go in here and\nI'm gonna grab [COUGH],\n\n265\n00:15:24.743 --> 00:15:29.467\nexcuse me, all of these ADMX files,\nas well as,\n\n266\n00:15:29.467 --> 00:15:33.523\nlet's just go ahead and copy these guys.\n\n267\n00:15:33.523 --> 00:15:35.307\nI'm gonna copy them and\n\n268\n00:15:35.307 --> 00:15:41.115\nI'm gonna navigate my way back over\nto C: > Windows > PolicyDefinitions.\n\n269\n00:15:41.115 --> 00:15:44.974\nAnd I'm gonna paste all\nthose new ADMX files.\n\n270\n00:15:44.974 --> 00:15:48.806\nSo there's Access,\nscroll down, there's my Excel.\n\n271\n00:15:48.806 --> 00:15:54.370\nThen I'm gonna go back and\ngrab that en-us folder.\n\n272\n00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:59.310\nAnd I'm gonna get all of those\nADML files and copy them.\n\n273\n00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:05.422\nAnd again go back over to C: >\nWindows > PolicyDefinitions.\n\n274\n00:16:05.422 --> 00:16:08.389\nInside that en-US folder and\n\n275\n00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:13.501\npaste I clicked on it and\nthere's no file, sorry.\n\n276\n00:16:13.501 --> 00:16:17.623\nWe'll paste all of those\nADML files in there.\n\n277\n00:16:17.623 --> 00:16:19.100\nSo far so good, right?\n\n278\n00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.080\nNothing too terribly difficult.\n\n279\n00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.560\nI go back over here,\nI'm gonna close my editor.\n\n280\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.790\nAnd I'm gonna right-click on\nthat GPO again, and choose edit.\n\n281\n00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.690\nAnd now, when I expand out\nuser configuration, policies,\n\n282\n00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:38.300\nadministrator templates, make that\na little wider, so we can see it.\n\n283\n00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.840\nLo and behold, look at that.\n\n284\n00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.570\nI now, have settings to control access.\n\n285\n00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:46.700\nI now, have group policy setting\nthat I can use to control Word, or\n\n286\n00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:51.310\nExcel, or PowerPoint, or whatever,\nand it was that easy, right?\n\n287\n00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:55.850\nLet's just see, remember there was what?\n\n288\n00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:56.395\n>> I think 300?\n\n289\n00:16:56.395 --> 00:16:59.460\n>> 1,800 settings in there,\nhow many settings were total before,\n\n290\n00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.470\ndown on up to 3,716 settings.\n\n291\n00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.860\nI doubled at least the number\nof settings I have available\n\n292\n00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.920\nGo up to Computer Configuration > Policies\n> Administrative Templates > All.\n\n293\n00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.250\nNow, I'm up to 2053, so\nnot as many settings for\n\n294\n00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:13.330\nOffice as on the computer half.\n\n295\n00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:18.870\nWhich kinda makes sense, the computer\ndoesn't use Office all that much,\n\n296\n00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:21.570\nit's primarily a user, right?\n\n297\n00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:24.520\nSo, we've increased the number\nof settings I have available, so\n\n298\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.610\nnow, I can control what\nthe default font is for Word.\n\n299\n00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:30.710\nWe want everybody in the office\nto use the same font,\n\n300\n00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.620\nwhen they create their reports in Word.\n\n301\n00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:37.450\nAnd now, I can set that without having to\ngo, and touch every single machine, right?\n\n302\n00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.090\nI can change the default number\nof worksheets that appears\n\n303\n00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:42.990\nin XL spreadsheet when\nyou click a new workbook.\n\n304\n00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:46.260\nI can control all of that stuff,\nthrough group policy.\n\n305\n00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:50.010\nSimply by going out, and downloading\nthese new administrative templates,\n\n306\n00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.020\nyou can extend the functionality\nof group policies, and\n\n307\n00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.210\nother companies can do the same thing,\nright?\n\n308\n00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:58.200\nYou might find that some program\nyou use internally to your company.\n\n309\n00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.770\nIf you go look at that vender's site, they\nmight have some ADMX files available for\n\n310\n00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:03.630\nyou to download.\n\n311\n00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.710\nThat you can then,\nadd just like I did, and\n\n312\n00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.900\nnow control that application\nthrough group policy.\n\n313\n00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.160\nSo fantastic, we love the format.\n\n314\n00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.240\nThese ADMX and these ADML files that\n\n315\n00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:18.320\nmake up all the settings that we see\nin those administrative templates.\n\n316\n00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.280\nExtremely easy to edit them if we need to.\n\n317\n00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.750\nOr even download them from somebody else,\n\n318\n00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:25.590\nget them into our policy\ndefinitions folder.\n\n319\n00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.740\nAnd just extend their\nfunctionality of group policy.\n\n320\n00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.900\n>> That's very good, and it didn't\nlook like it was too difficult there.\n\n321\n00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.000\nCuz in some of the technology we talk\nabout, other things like for instance\n\n322\n00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.935\none of the things I think of is like\nimporting, and exporting certificates.\n\n323\n00:18:35.935 --> 00:18:37.130\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> A lot of wizards,\n\n324\n00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.670\na lot of choices that you have to make.\n\n325\n00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:42.260\nThis is a simple just copy,\ncut, and paste, that's it?\n\n326\n00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.010\nOr copy, paste I guess I should say?\n\n327\n00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:45.460\n>> Yeah, that was it,\nyou just add them in there, and\n\n328\n00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.910\nall of a sudden they\nare going to be available.\n\n329\n00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:51.470\nBut there is a catch to it, there is\nsomething that we've got to take a look\n\n330\n00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:54.140\nat, and\nthat is where those files are stored.\n\n331\n00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:58.880\n>> Now, remember, we were talking\nabout this in a different episode.\n\n332\n00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.395\nWe mentioned their gonna be stored in\nthe Active Directory through a database.\n\n333\n00:19:03.395 --> 00:19:06.115\nAnd if you haven't checked that out,\ngo back, and check that episode out.\n\n334\n00:19:06.115 --> 00:19:07.465\nYou talked about the sysvol folder too.\n\n335\n00:19:07.465 --> 00:19:10.565\nAnd we know that that\ninformation's gonna be replicated.\n\n336\n00:19:10.565 --> 00:19:13.605\nYou mentioned it to all the domain\ncontrollers in the domain.\n\n337\n00:19:13.605 --> 00:19:16.420\nSo, we already got a storage location.\n\n338\n00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.590\nWhat's the benefits, I mean or\ndrawbacks, to having that,\n\n339\n00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.860\nif you've got multiple domain control,\nit's all communicating together.\n\n340\n00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.170\n>> Yeah,\nthat's the big problem we had here was,\n\n341\n00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:27.830\nyou saw where I went to get\nto those policy definitions.\n\n342\n00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.630\nC colon Windows policy definitions.\n\n343\n00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:34.260\nThat's not the active directory database,\nthat's not the Cisfal folder structure.\n\n344\n00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.690\nRight, that's a local depository\non this domain controller.\n\n345\n00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:41.870\nSo, even though I added those new\nADMX files, and those ADML files,\n\n346\n00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.560\nand they're available on\nthis domain controller,\n\n347\n00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.920\nthey won't be available on\nother domain controllers.\n\n348\n00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.770\nEvery Windows machine has\ntheir own copy of those ADMX,\n\n349\n00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:55.030\nand those ADML files, and\nthat's an issue, right?\n\n350\n00:19:55.030 --> 00:20:00.020\nBecause if I go in, and modify,\none of those existing ADMX files,\n\n351\n00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:01.810\nor I create my own.\n\n352\n00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:05.840\nOr I import, like I did, some ADMX\nfiles that I downloaded from Microsoft.\n\n353\n00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.440\nThis domain controller now has those\na copy, C: > Windows > Policy definitions.\n\n354\n00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.960\nIt has those ADMX and those ADML files.\n\n355\n00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.530\nBut if I go to a different\ndomain controller, and\n\n356\n00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:18.230\nI open up that group management\npolicy editor, and I edit policies on\n\n357\n00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:22.190\nthat domain controller, he's not going\nto have the same settings available.\n\n358\n00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:25.160\nThey're just not going to be there,\nand that's a problem.\n\n359\n00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.280\nWe want consistency.\n\n360\n00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.740\nWe want to make sure that if I import\nthose templates, I don't have to\n\n361\n00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.420\nimport them onto every single domain\ncontroller that I have out there.\n\n362\n00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:38.060\nSo, we need to figure out a way to make\nsure that all my domain controllers\n\n363\n00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.910\nare sharing a copy rather than each\nmaintaining their own copy of those\n\n364\n00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:42.460\nADML files.\n\n365\n00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.780\nIt's what we call a version issue,\nalright?\n\n366\n00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.980\nIt's extremely easy to do,\nit's just not done by default, and\n\n367\n00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.600\nhonestly I'm not exactly sure why.\n\n368\n00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.750\nI'm sure Microsoft had a very\ngood reason for doing this.\n\n369\n00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.960\nI don't know what that is.\n\n370\n00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.730\nBut I'm going to show you how to fix it,\nalright?\n\n371\n00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:04.170\nSo, to clarify or to make sure we\nare on the same page here I'm going to\n\n372\n00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:07.000\nedit this GPO again, the same GPO,\nand I'm going to expand out policies,\n\n373\n00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.200\nand I'm going to expand out\nadministrative templates.\n\n374\n00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.810\nI'm going to hover over administrative\ntemplates, and what you'll see there,\n\n375\n00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:16.470\nin fact let's just make this really wide.\n\n376\n00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:21.440\nYou see, administrative templates\npolicy definition ADMX files\n\n377\n00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.950\nretrieve from the local computer.\n\n378\n00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:28.440\nThat means it's looking at Sekal,\nand Windows policy definitions.\n\n379\n00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:33.780\nNow, something I didn't mention earlier I\njust wanted to ht real quick, every GPO,\n\n380\n00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:37.740\nnow has access to those on\nthis domain controller.\n\n381\n00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.490\nRight, if I go make a brand new,\n\n382\n00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.990\nI didn't import the templates\ninto a particular GPO.\n\n383\n00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:47.980\nI imported them into that one location,\nseek all windows policy definition.\n\n384\n00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:53.340\nAll GPO's have access to that seek\nall windows policy definition.\n\n385\n00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.210\nThat's a big change\nfrom the old ADM files,\n\n386\n00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:59.680\nback in the day with the ADM files Each\nGPO had its own copy of the ADM files.\n\n387\n00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.640\nWhich means every time\nyou created a new GPO,\n\n388\n00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.110\nyour now storing another\ncopy of those ADM files.\n\n389\n00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:09.180\nThat was a big bloat issue that we\nhad to deal with back in the day,\n\n390\n00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:12.410\nwe don't have that bloat\nissue anymore because\n\n391\n00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:16.820\nthere is now one copy on this domain\ncontroller that all GPO's have access to.\n\n392\n00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:22.760\nIf I make a third GPO here, we'll call it\nGPO 3, and I edit that GPO, and I go down\n\n393\n00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:29.570\ninto policies, administrative templates,\nthere's all those settings, right.\n\n394\n00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:32.640\nBut again, so, the bloat issue is gone.\n\n395\n00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.060\nThe version issue we still have\nbecause that's a local resource to\n\n396\n00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.290\nthis domain controller.\n\n397\n00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.290\nTo fix it?\n\n398\n00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.800\nYou set up what's called a central store.\n\n399\n00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.280\nThat's all we're going to do.\n\n400\n00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:46.250\nWe're going to create one place where all\ndomain controllers are going to go to get\n\n401\n00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:48.030\ntheir copy of these ADMX and ADML files.\n\n402\n00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:48.960\nLet me rephrase that.\n\n403\n00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.590\nWe're not going to create\none place where they all go.\n\n404\n00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:57.620\nWe're gonna make sure that they're sharing\ntheir copies, so that if I make changes,\n\n405\n00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:01.460\nthat change gets to the other\ndomain controllers as well.\n\n406\n00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:05.600\nSo, I need something Wes that replicates\nfrom one domain controller to another.\n\n407\n00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.631\n>> Is there anything we have like that?\n\n408\n00:23:07.631 --> 00:23:09.340\n>> Yeah, I could think of something.\n\n409\n00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.580\nSo, let me make sure that\nI understand this, right.\n\n410\n00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.560\nSo, in an instance where,\nlets say this is DCO 1,\n\n411\n00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.180\none domain controller, you just wanted to\ncontrol office, and extend the reach, and\n\n412\n00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.170\nconfiguration of your group policies.\n\n413\n00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:22.200\nNow, I log into DCO2, and\nI want to control Office.\n\n414\n00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.220\nThose policies aren't going to be there\n>> There not going to be\n\n415\n00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.270\nthere exactly, right.\n\n416\n00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:31.690\nIt's interesting the way it works,\nsomething we haven't talked about yet,\n\n417\n00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.460\nwhen you open up that group management\nconsole, it actually reaches out, and\n\n418\n00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.500\nfinds what's known as the PDC Emulator.\n\n419\n00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.590\nThis is a single mass or operation role.\n\n420\n00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:44.580\nSo, no matter what machine you're at,\neverytime you edit group policy,\n\n421\n00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.220\nit always points to the same\ndomain controller by default.\n\n422\n00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.380\nSo, if you import the templates onto\nthat particular domain controller,\n\n423\n00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:54.520\nremember there's only one\nPDC emulator in your domain.\n\n424\n00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.740\nIf everybody points to the same one,\nand I import template into there, then,\n\n425\n00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.580\nwe'll still have access to those settings,\nright?\n\n426\n00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:04.100\nBut the other domain controllers\nare not and there's no guarantee.\n\n427\n00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.171\nJust because by default it\npoints to the PDC emulator,\n\n428\n00:24:07.171 --> 00:24:09.975\nI can open up my group\npolicy management console,\n\n429\n00:24:09.975 --> 00:24:13.344\nand I can change what domain\ncontroller I'm working with.\n\n430\n00:24:13.344 --> 00:24:19.196\nIf I go down here and\nI should be able to find, let's see here.\n\n431\n00:24:19.196 --> 00:24:20.730\nWhere's it gonna let me change?\n\n432\n00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.350\nYou can change the focus.\n\n433\n00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:25.700\nAnd Wes, it's been so\nlong since I've tried to do it.\n\n434\n00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.010\nThere we go, Change Domain Controller.\n\n435\n00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:31.480\nI can actually change\nthe focus of the snap in.\n\n436\n00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.240\nAnd if I change it to\na different domain controller?\n\n437\n00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.620\nIt wouldn't have a copy\nof those templates.\n\n438\n00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:38.240\nThat's exactly, right.\n\n439\n00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.520\nSo, what we want to do is we want to\nmake sure that these templates are being\n\n440\n00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.040\nreplicated.\n\n441\n00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.540\nWhen I import new templates\nunder one domain controller,\n\n442\n00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:48.710\nI want those templates to then, replicate\nto all of the other domain controllers.\n\n443\n00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:52.370\nAnd for that we're gonna take advantage\nof something we already have, and\n\n444\n00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:53.340\nthat's SYSVOL, right?\n\n445\n00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.860\nSYSVOL is a folder structure\nthat replicates from one domain\n\n446\n00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.510\ncontroller to the other.\n\n447\n00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:58.398\nThis is how easy it is to do.\n\n448\n00:24:58.398 --> 00:25:03.070\nWatch this, Ww're going to, let me\njust close that little Window there.\n\n449\n00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:09.000\nI'm gonna open up file explorer, and I'm\ngonna go find those policy definitions.\n\n450\n00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.037\nSo, C colon windows policy\ndefinitions inside there is my ADMX,\n\n451\n00:25:14.037 --> 00:25:15.820\nand my ADML files.\n\n452\n00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:19.270\nAlright, so\nI'm gonna just copy that entire folder.\n\n453\n00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:24.450\nAnd then, I'm gonna navigate my way\n\n454\n00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:28.520\nto C colon Windows Cisfal.\n\n455\n00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:32.710\nGo into Cisfal again,\ngo in to my domain, and\n\n456\n00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:37.430\ngo into policies, and\nI'm gonna paste that policy definitions.\n\n457\n00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:38.720\nRight there.\n\n458\n00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.220\nRight?\n\n459\n00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.200\nSo now, it's got a copy of,\nright there in PolicyDefinitions.\n\n460\n00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.930\nI've got all those ADMX,\nand those ADML files.\n\n461\n00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.810\nNow, I'm simply gonna go back out.\n\n462\n00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:51.070\nAnd I'm gonna edit one of these GPO's.\n\n463\n00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:52.200\nAnd I'm gonna expand this out.\n\n464\n00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.680\nAnd we're gonna go Policies.\n\n465\n00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:56.300\nOops.\nWe'll go Policies,\n\n466\n00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.330\nAdministrative Templates.\n\n467\n00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:58.939\nAnd look what it says, now.\n\n468\n00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.385\nRetrieve it from the central store.\n\n469\n00:26:03.385 --> 00:26:06.350\nSom immediately it saw that folderm and\nsaid,\n\n470\n00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:10.390\noh, there is now a copy in the SYSVOL, I'm\ngonna use that instead of my local copy.\n\n471\n00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:15.974\nAnd SYSVOL replicates to\nall the domain controllers,\n\n472\n00:26:15.974 --> 00:26:20.510\nso all the domain controllers now share\na copy of those ADMX and ADML files.\n\n473\n00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:21.750\nIf I import new templates, or\n\n474\n00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:24.740\nevery domain controller's gonna\nget a copy of the template.\n\n475\n00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:28.760\nNow, it doesn't matter what domain\ncontroller I go to to edit policies,\n\n476\n00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.970\nI'm always gonna have those\nsame settings available.\n\n477\n00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:33.865\nAnd you saw how easy it was to do.\n\n478\n00:26:33.865 --> 00:26:38.205\nThe only thing I had to do,\nwas know where to put it, and\n\n479\n00:26:38.205 --> 00:26:42.335\nmake sure it's name, policy definitions,\nno space, and definitions is plural.\n\n480\n00:26:42.335 --> 00:26:45.660\nIf I name it anything else, it's not gonna\nrecognize it, and this isn't gonna work.\n\n481\n00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.024\nSo, that's why I simply\njust copy that folder.\n\n482\n00:26:48.024 --> 00:26:51.760\n>> [LAUGH] That way I don't have to\nworry about, any typos in the name.\n\n483\n00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.920\nSo now, we don't have to worry about, I\nwas gonna configure the domain controller.\n\n484\n00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.160\nI've imported Office Templates to DC01.\n\n485\n00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.750\nAnd if I'm at DC02, now I've gotta open\nthe Group Policy Management Console,\n\n486\n00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.010\nconnect to another domain controller.\n\n487\n00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:07.230\nNow, it doesn't matter\nwhat DC that you're on.\n\n488\n00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:07.870\nYou can manage them.\n\n489\n00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:08.980\nI get it.\nA little bit easier.\n\n490\n00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.190\n>> Absolutely right, Wes.\n\n491\n00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:12.320\nAnd now, I know that every domain\ncontroller is gonna have a copy\n\n492\n00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.580\nof those ADMX, and those ADML files,\nthat retrieve them from the central store.\n\n493\n00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.960\nSo, if anybody makes a change\nto one of those ADMX files?\n\n494\n00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.500\nWell, that's gonna be apparent\non all those domain controllers.\n\n495\n00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:29.050\nIf we import any new templates in, all the\nmain controllers are going to have access\n\n496\n00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:32.840\nto that, so its a great thing to do, and\nthat solves that version issue, right?\n\n497\n00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.110\nEven if two domain controllers had\nthe same template, if I made changes\n\n498\n00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:39.430\nto that template on one domain controller,\nand not the other, then, we didn't set up\n\n499\n00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:42.340\nthe central store, and I've got two\ndifferent versions of that template.\n\n500\n00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.240\nSo, depending on which domain controller\nyou hit when you log on you might, or\n\n501\n00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.980\nmight not get that setting, right?\n\n502\n00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.820\nSo, this is a way to make sure their all,\nwe dont have that,\n\n503\n00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.890\nwe just eliminate the version\nissue altogether.\n\n504\n00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:53.740\nSo, by switching to ADMX and\n\n505\n00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:57.430\nADML files we lose the bloat issue cause\nthey're no longer stored in every GBO, and\n\n506\n00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:03.720\nby creating that central store we\neliminate the version issue because\n\n507\n00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.870\nno they're replicating copies\nof those templates, and\n\n508\n00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:11.600\nwe don't have to worry about one\nmachine having different copy network.\n\n509\n00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.400\nAlright, very good.\n\n510\n00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.540\n>> In this episode keep in mind we've\ntalked a little bit about the ADM files,\n\n511\n00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.780\nand the difference between that,\nand the ADMX files.\n\n512\n00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:23.520\nWe've talked about what the ADMX\n,and the ADML files are about.\n\n513\n00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.110\nWe've also talked about the location\nof those administrative templates, and\n\n514\n00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:32.550\nhow to Port template, so that you can\nextend the reach, and the configuration\n\n515\n00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:35.290\nof your group policy, and\nthe benefits of that centralized store.\n\n516\n00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.180\nA lot of good concepts,\na lot of good stuff.\n\n517\n00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.780\nAnd looks like we're coming\nto the end of this episode.\n\n518\n00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:44.380\n>> So, we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna stop it right here, and\n\n519\n00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:49.460\nsigning off for\nitpro.tv I'm your host Wes Brian.\n\n520\n00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:55.142\n>> And I'm mike [INAUDIBLE]\n>> And we'll see ya' next time.\n\n521\n00:28:55.142 --> 00:28:56.603\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.058\nI'm Wes Brian, I'll be your host today.\n\n4\n00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:20.555\nIn today's episode we're gonna be moving\nthrough working through group policy.\n\n5\n00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:23.363\nAnd today we're gonna be talking\nabout group policy scope and\n\n6\n00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:26.441\nwho better to take care of this topic for\nus, but none other than Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:28.721\nMike Rodrick, Mike,\nhow's it going today man?\n\n8\n00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:31.746\n>> I'm doing great Wes,\ngreat to be here and what are you saying,\n\n9\n00:00:31.746 --> 00:00:32.841\nI've got bad breath.\n\n10\n00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:35.260\n>> Oh yeah man, yeah,\nyou got to break out that scope.\n\n11\n00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.731\nAnd you know we had to use\nthat joke at least once today.\n\n12\n00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.681\nAnd we are going to be talking\nabout good old group policy scope.\n\n13\n00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:45.367\nAnd when we're talking about scoping\na policy, we're actually gonna go\n\n14\n00:00:45.367 --> 00:00:48.933\nover several things and the main topic\nis going to be scoping a policy and\n\n15\n00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:53.290\nwhat it means by scoping a policy is\ndetermining who the policy applies to.\n\n16\n00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.712\nAnd when I say who, don't forget, this\ncould be a user or could be a computer,\n\n17\n00:00:57.712 --> 00:01:01.131\nwe're really talking about\na security principal, right?\n\n18\n00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:02.251\nWhen we talk about who it applies to.\n\n19\n00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:06.470\nSo could be a computer, could be a user.\n\n20\n00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.540\nAnd we've said several times,\nthat group policies are great,\n\n21\n00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.920\nbecause I can centrally manage\nmy configuration management,\n\n22\n00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.400\nand we can apply settings to all\nthe computers out there on the network.\n\n23\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.310\nAll the users out there or simply a sub\nset of users like just the people in\n\n24\n00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.920\nthe sales department or just the computers\nin the London branch office or\n\n25\n00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.850\nheck we can do just the computers that are\nrunning Windows 7 on a mobile platform.\n\n26\n00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.612\nI mean we can get very\nspecific with this stuff.\n\n27\n00:01:30.612 --> 00:01:34.220\nThe question then is, how do we do that?\n\n28\n00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.320\nHow do we determine or how do we decide or\n\n29\n00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.071\nimplement I should say who\nthis policy applies to?\n\n30\n00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:42.201\nAnd that's what they refer refer to\nas scooping in the Microsoft world.\n\n31\n00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:46.987\nWhen you say that's scoop of the policy\nis who the policy is who the policy\n\n32\n00:01:46.987 --> 00:01:47.862\napplies to.\n\n33\n00:01:47.862 --> 00:01:52.000\nSo now we have to figure\nout how do we do that.\n\n34\n00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.481\nAnd we do it by linking a GPO to\na certain location in Active Directory.\n\n35\n00:01:57.481 --> 00:01:59.392\nIt's really pretty darn simple.\n\n36\n00:01:59.392 --> 00:02:01.020\n>> Very good.\nSo you know you talked about in\n\n37\n00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.823\nother episodes you mentioned that\ndefault domain policy right?\n\n38\n00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:05.006\nThe default domain policy,\n\n39\n00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:07.671\nif I understand, it's gonna apply\nto every body in the domain.\n\n40\n00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:10.511\nDon't matter if it's an Administrator,\ndoesn't matter if it's a User.\n\n41\n00:02:10.511 --> 00:02:12.961\nMatter if it's a computer,\na server goes to every body but\n\n42\n00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:14.763\nthat might not be efficient for\nwhat we do.\n\n43\n00:02:14.763 --> 00:02:16.814\nSo we're gonna kinda rifle this down and\n\n44\n00:02:16.814 --> 00:02:19.722\ntarget in on maybe some specifics\nhere on this one right?\n\n45\n00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:22.541\n>> Exactly, so let's dive in,\nlet's take a look I'm\n\n46\n00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:26.898\ngonna open up my Group Policy Management\nConsole here on my Domain Controller and\n\n47\n00:02:26.898 --> 00:02:31.082\nlet's take a look at what we can do and\nhow we go about scoping these policies.\n\n48\n00:02:31.082 --> 00:02:36.407\nSo we'll close that little dialogue box\nthere, and I'll expand out my forest,\n\n49\n00:02:36.407 --> 00:02:40.910\nand I'll expand out domains, and\nI'll expand out lab.itprotv.\n\n50\n00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.700\nAnd underneath there we can see all of\nthe OUs that I have in Active Directory.\n\n51\n00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.010\nAnd if we expand out group policy objects,\nit is the default install.\n\n52\n00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.290\nSo I've got those two default\npolicies that are sitting there.\n\n53\n00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.021\nWe got by default domain policy.\n\n54\n00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:57.062\nIt might default the main\ncontroller policy.\n\n55\n00:02:57.062 --> 00:03:00.842\nNow, first thing we wanna take a look\nat when we talk about these links,\n\n56\n00:03:00.842 --> 00:03:02.805\nlinks are their own object, right?\n\n57\n00:03:02.805 --> 00:03:05.884\nThey are separate from the GPO itself.\n\n58\n00:03:05.884 --> 00:03:09.076\nFor example, let me go in here and\n\n59\n00:03:09.076 --> 00:03:14.452\njust make a quick new GPO and\nI'm gonna call it test GPO.\n\n60\n00:03:14.452 --> 00:03:18.071\nAll right, now that test GPO is residing\nin that group policy objects container,\n\n61\n00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:21.691\nwe talked about that the other day, some\nof that is stored in the database itself,\n\n62\n00:03:21.691 --> 00:03:23.071\nsome of it stored in SYSVault.\n\n63\n00:03:23.071 --> 00:03:24.911\nBut that policy is just sitting there.\n\n64\n00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:26.633\nIt's not linked to anything.\n\n65\n00:03:26.633 --> 00:03:31.752\nSo at this point it doesn't apply to\nanybody, it's just sitting there.\n\n66\n00:03:31.752 --> 00:03:36.276\nIf I decide I want to apply it, then\nthat's when we have to come in here and\n\n67\n00:03:36.276 --> 00:03:38.255\nchoose where I want to link it.\n\n68\n00:03:38.255 --> 00:03:40.969\nNow, when we link it,\nI'm gonna kinda jump around and\n\n69\n00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:42.681\nI know it's not on our notes here.\n\n70\n00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:48.720\nWhen we link this policy we've got a few\nplaces we can choose to link it, right?\n\n71\n00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.640\nIt's going to be either\nthe site itself the site,\n\n72\n00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.310\nremember if you watched our Active\nDirectory episodes, a site is a physical\n\n73\n00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.520\nrepresentation of my Active Directory\ndomain or a portion of my network.\n\n74\n00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.040\nWe can link policies to the site, we can\nlink policies to the domain itself and\n\n75\n00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.020\nwe can link policies to\norganizational units and that's it.\n\n76\n00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.700\nI mean, we cannot link GPOs to groups,\nwe cannot link GPOs to users,\n\n77\n00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.720\nwe can't link GPOs to computer accounts.\n\n78\n00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.711\nOnly thing we can link a GPO to is\nthe site, the domain and the OU.\n\n79\n00:04:21.711 --> 00:04:24.792\nAnd in here we're gonna work\nstrictly with the domain in the OU.\n\n80\n00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:26.918\nSite policies are not as common but\n\n81\n00:04:26.918 --> 00:04:30.152\nit is important that we\nunderstand that we can do it.\n\n82\n00:04:30.152 --> 00:04:34.804\nIn order to link a policy to the site you\nwould need to be an Enterprise Admin,\n\n83\n00:04:34.804 --> 00:04:39.180\nnot just a the domain admin because\nsites can cross domain boundaries.\n\n84\n00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.066\nI could have a physical location that\ncontain more than one domain and so\n\n85\n00:04:43.066 --> 00:04:47.172\nif I link the policy to the site it could\nbe applying to more than one domain.\n\n86\n00:04:47.172 --> 00:04:49.160\nObjects in more than one\ndomain admin cannot do that.\n\n87\n00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.662\nThe domain admin can only work with\nobjects within the domain if he has\n\n88\n00:04:53.662 --> 00:04:55.690\nadministrative rights over.\n\n89\n00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.931\nSo site you can see that it is in here it\nprobably not even enabled on this default.\n\n90\n00:04:59.931 --> 00:05:03.831\nBoth install, and I don't have any sites\nset up but as long as I was logged on as\n\n91\n00:05:03.831 --> 00:05:07.563\nan enterprise admin, I could come down\nthere and I could work with those.\n\n92\n00:05:07.563 --> 00:05:10.544\nWe're gonna work again with the domain and\nthe OU.\n\n93\n00:05:10.544 --> 00:05:13.091\nSecond thing that we need to understand,\n\n94\n00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:16.964\nwell kind of continuing on with\nthat thought, site domain OU.\n\n95\n00:05:16.964 --> 00:05:22.444\nRemember what an OU is and the difference\nbetween OUs and containers, right.\n\n96\n00:05:22.444 --> 00:05:26.284\nIn Active Directory we\nhave as well as OUs.\n\n97\n00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:30.561\nIn fact, let me open up my\nActive Directory users and computers, and\n\n98\n00:05:30.561 --> 00:05:34.121\nI'll try to make it so\nwe can kinda see both of these here.\n\n99\n00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:37.061\nSo I'm gonna kinda flip\na couple of windows around.\n\n100\n00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:39.952\nYou'll see here is my\nActive Directory on the right,\n\n101\n00:05:39.952 --> 00:05:43.241\nover here on the left is my\ngroup policy management consult.\n\n102\n00:05:43.241 --> 00:05:47.663\nAnd notice there's some things in active\ndirectory that don't show up in my GPMC,\n\n103\n00:05:47.663 --> 00:05:51.472\nin my group policy management consult,\nlike built in is not over here.\n\n104\n00:05:51.472 --> 00:05:54.372\nComputers is not in my group\npolicy management console.\n\n105\n00:05:54.372 --> 00:05:58.979\nFor security principles, users,\nmanaged service accounts,\n\n106\n00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:04.620\nthat's because those are containers and\nyou cannot link a GPO to a container.\n\n107\n00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.233\nOnly to the site,\nto the domain, and to the OUs.\n\n108\n00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:10.987\nSo that's why they don't even show up\nwithin that group policy management\n\n109\n00:06:10.987 --> 00:06:11.530\nconsole.\n\n110\n00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.881\nAll right, now as I said,\nthe links are independent form the GPO.\n\n111\n00:06:17.881 --> 00:06:20.934\nSo if we look and\nI created that GPO called test GPO,\n\n112\n00:06:20.934 --> 00:06:22.851\nit's not linked anywhere yet.\n\n113\n00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:25.500\nLet's say I want to link it to the domain,\n\n114\n00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.761\nit's got a setting that I want to\napply to everybody in the domain.\n\n115\n00:06:29.761 --> 00:06:34.321\nWell, I can choose to scope it or\nlink it to the domain.\n\n116\n00:06:34.321 --> 00:06:38.287\nLet's back up for one second and when we\nlink these GPOs, we're gonna talk a little\n\n117\n00:06:38.287 --> 00:06:41.575\nbit more about this, but\nunderstand understand that they inherit,\n\n118\n00:06:41.575 --> 00:06:43.972\nmuch like permissions that\nyou work with in NTFS.\n\n119\n00:06:43.972 --> 00:06:45.705\nIf I link a GPO with a domain,\n\n120\n00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:50.412\nwell that's gonna inherit down\nthe everything inside that domain, right?\n\n121\n00:06:50.412 --> 00:06:53.348\nSo we always wanna just like\nwe do with permissions,\n\n122\n00:06:53.348 --> 00:06:56.902\nyou wanna always link the GPO\nwith the highest level possible.\n\n123\n00:06:56.902 --> 00:06:59.337\nIf I've got a domain\nwith five OUs in it and\n\n124\n00:06:59.337 --> 00:07:05.190\nI've got a policy that should apply to all\nfive OUs, I could link it to all five OUs.\n\n125\n00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.651\nOr I could link it once to the domain and\njust let it inherit down, right?\n\n126\n00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:11.731\nA lot less work,\nless administrative effort.\n\n127\n00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:14.973\nSo if I wanna link a policy,\nlet's take a look here,\n\n128\n00:07:14.973 --> 00:07:18.840\nif I could just right-click on my domain,\nlab.itpro.tv.\n\n129\n00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.161\nLink an existing GPO\nbecause it already exists,\n\n130\n00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:26.621\nI just created it, choose that GPO\nthat I wanna link and click OK.\n\n131\n00:07:26.621 --> 00:07:29.821\nAnd you'll see there is now a link for\nthat GPO,\n\n132\n00:07:29.821 --> 00:07:32.222\nit's linked to the domain itself.\n\n133\n00:07:32.222 --> 00:07:36.922\nThe GPO still resides down here in\nthe group policy object's container.\n\n134\n00:07:36.922 --> 00:07:42.060\nThis is the link up here and you'll see\nthat the icon is slightly different.\n\n135\n00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.640\nIt might be tricky to\nsee on the screen but\n\n136\n00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.910\ndown here it looks like a little scroll,\nright?\n\n137\n00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:52.560\nUp here where it's linked it has a little\nblack arrow on the corner of it.\n\n138\n00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.171\nAnd you've seen those icons before,\n\n139\n00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:57.201\nright, that have a little black arrow\ndown in that bottom left corner.\n\n140\n00:07:57.201 --> 00:07:58.341\nWhat does that typically indicate?\n\n141\n00:07:58.341 --> 00:07:59.981\n>> It usually means you can expand it out,\nright?\n\n142\n00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:00.621\n>> Or it's a shortcut.\n\n143\n00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:01.221\n>> That's a shortcut.\n\n144\n00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:03.270\n>> Think about icons on your desktop,\nright?\n\n145\n00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:07.272\nWhen you have a shortcut to your program\non your desktop it's got that little black\n\n146\n00:08:07.272 --> 00:08:08.551\narrow down in the corner.\n\n147\n00:08:08.551 --> 00:08:12.371\nIt's telling you this isn't the actual\nprogram but it's a link to the program.\n\n148\n00:08:12.371 --> 00:08:14.938\nYou double click on it and\nit's going to reach out,\n\n149\n00:08:14.938 --> 00:08:18.771\nfind that executable Windows Explorer and\nit's going to run that program.\n\n150\n00:08:18.771 --> 00:08:20.000\nIt's the same thing here.\n\n151\n00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.631\nThis is a link to the GPO,\nbecause we can link a single\n\n152\n00:08:24.631 --> 00:08:28.861\ngroup policy object to\nmore than one location.\n\n153\n00:08:28.861 --> 00:08:33.983\nSo in this case again I've linked\nit up there to the domain itself,\n\n154\n00:08:33.983 --> 00:08:36.181\nand that will inherit down.\n\n155\n00:08:36.181 --> 00:08:39.161\nThe link I should say,\nhas its own properties, and\n\n156\n00:08:39.161 --> 00:08:42.641\nI'm gonna explain this little\ndialog box in just a minute.\n\n157\n00:08:42.641 --> 00:08:45.040\nIf we take a look at this link,\nI can right click on it.\n\n158\n00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:45.600\nRight?\n\n159\n00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.590\nAnd I've got a few options,\nenforce and enable.\n\n160\n00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:49.770\nAnd we'll come back and\n\n161\n00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.720\nwe're gonna talk about that enforcement\nas we progress through this video.\n\n162\n00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.130\nThe link enabled,\nyou notice it's enabled by default,\n\n163\n00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.251\nso as soon as I link it,\nit is already turned on.\n\n164\n00:09:04.251 --> 00:09:08.926\nWe can link a single GPO to more than\none location, so I can go down, and\n\n165\n00:09:08.926 --> 00:09:14.370\nlet's Let me just delete this, and\nthis is actually a good example here.\n\n166\n00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.920\nRemember I said that the link and\nthe GPO are separate objects?\n\n167\n00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.250\nSo what if I delete this link?\n\n168\n00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.640\nSays, do you want to delete it?\n\n169\n00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.301\nAnd it even tells you,\nthis will not delete the GPO itself.\n\n170\n00:09:25.301 --> 00:09:26.901\nOh god, they gave away my secret.\n\n171\n00:09:26.901 --> 00:09:27.881\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n172\n00:09:27.881 --> 00:09:31.394\nthis is kinda like when you reference\nthat shortcut on your desktop,\n\n173\n00:09:31.394 --> 00:09:33.101\nyou're deleting the shortcut.\n\n174\n00:09:33.101 --> 00:09:36.025\nThe program behind it, or\nin this case the The GPO and\n\n175\n00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:39.019\nits settings within the GPO,\nthey're still there,\n\n176\n00:09:39.019 --> 00:09:42.740\nwe don't have that shortcut up at\nthe domain level in this case.\n\n177\n00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:47.291\n>> Exactly right, so the object still\nsits there, I deleted the link.\n\n178\n00:09:47.291 --> 00:09:51.200\nSo it's no longer linked to the domain,\nmeans it no longer applies, right?\n\n179\n00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.510\nThat GPO is still there but\nit's no longer being applied.\n\n180\n00:09:54.510 --> 00:10:00.282\nAnd just for an example I'll\nexpand out my employees OU,\n\n181\n00:10:00.282 --> 00:10:04.489\nand I could come in and\nI could link Think,\n\n182\n00:10:04.489 --> 00:10:10.883\nthat test GPO to the GNVOU,\nI could link it again to the NYC GPO.\n\n183\n00:10:10.883 --> 00:10:11.422\nRight.\n\n184\n00:10:11.422 --> 00:10:17.550\nSo now if I take a look I'll see test GPOs\nlinked to two different places, right?\n\n185\n00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.720\nSingle GPO linked to two\ndifferent locations.\n\n186\n00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.642\nSo what's, again it's important to\nremember that link is its own object.\n\n187\n00:10:25.642 --> 00:10:28.752\nNow when I click on this link you'll\nsee this little warning here.\n\n188\n00:10:28.752 --> 00:10:33.011\nIt says you've selected a link to a group\npolicy object except for changes you make\n\n189\n00:10:33.011 --> 00:10:36.652\nto the link properties, changes you\nmake here are global to the GPO and\n\n190\n00:10:36.652 --> 00:10:39.512\nwill impact other locations\nwhere this GPO is linked.\n\n191\n00:10:39.512 --> 00:10:43.853\nAnd I'm going to go ahead and say, don't\nshow me this again now that we've seen it.\n\n192\n00:10:43.853 --> 00:10:46.380\nWhat that's telling me, or\nwhat that's supposed to\n\n193\n00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.872\ndo is remind an administrator or\nwhoever's been delegated permission.\n\n194\n00:10:49.872 --> 00:10:52.240\nCan work in here.\n\n195\n00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.841\nThat's not the actual GPO.\n\n196\n00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:56.281\nThat is a link to the GPO.\n\n197\n00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.387\nSo in other words,\n\n198\n00:10:57.387 --> 00:11:01.894\nwhat if I've been given permissions to\nwork with GPO's link to Gainsville?\n\n199\n00:11:01.894 --> 00:11:04.118\nAnd I come in one day and\nI decide, you know what,\n\n200\n00:11:04.118 --> 00:11:07.442\nI have a new setting that I wanna push\nout to all the people in Gainsville.\n\n201\n00:11:07.442 --> 00:11:11.876\nSo I open up group policy management and I\nsee this GPO already linked to Gainsville\n\n202\n00:11:11.876 --> 00:11:14.520\nand think,\nI'll just go make the change there.\n\n203\n00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.751\nI can right click on it choose Edit and\nI'm editing that GPO.\n\n204\n00:11:18.751 --> 00:11:22.748\nBut what I might not be aware of is\nthat GPO is linked to other places.\n\n205\n00:11:22.748 --> 00:11:27.212\nSo that change that I make that I wanna\nimplement in Gainesville is now also\n\n206\n00:11:27.212 --> 00:11:31.182\ngonna effect New York City because\nthat same GPO is linked there.\n\n207\n00:11:31.182 --> 00:11:32.342\nAnd I didn't intend to do that.\n\n208\n00:11:32.342 --> 00:11:36.230\nI didn't mean to mess with New York City\nthis was a setting that I wanted to do\n\n209\n00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.481\njust for Gainesville.\n\n210\n00:11:37.481 --> 00:11:42.238\nSo that's why it tries to remind you,\nhey if you edit this, you're not editing\n\n211\n00:11:42.238 --> 00:11:46.862\nthe link you're editing the GPO and\nthat GPO could be linked to one location.\n\n212\n00:11:46.862 --> 00:11:51.196\nSo any changes you make to the GPO\nare gonna affect all those different\n\n213\n00:11:51.196 --> 00:11:53.523\nlocations where that GPO is linked.\n\n214\n00:11:53.523 --> 00:11:55.568\nSo it's something that\nwe've got to keep in mind.\n\n215\n00:11:55.568 --> 00:11:58.163\n>> Yeah, no MIke and one of the things\nI'm thinking of as kind of a recap and\n\n216\n00:11:58.163 --> 00:12:00.396\nsome of the stuff that you've\nalready talked Talked about.\n\n217\n00:12:00.396 --> 00:12:02.397\nYou guys go back and watch these episodes,\n\n218\n00:12:02.397 --> 00:12:06.138\nit's that's we've got a container it\ndoesn't contain any actual settings.\n\n219\n00:12:06.138 --> 00:12:10.103\nThe settings are the policies themselves\nwhen you configure them we still got\n\n220\n00:12:10.103 --> 00:12:11.573\nto turn the light switch on.\n\n221\n00:12:11.573 --> 00:12:13.916\nJust because we install the light switch,\ndoesn't mean we're turning it on.\n\n222\n00:12:13.916 --> 00:12:16.752\nAnd the link itself is what's\ngoing to actually say.\n\n223\n00:12:16.752 --> 00:12:19.885\nOkay, now there's GPO been configured.\n\n224\n00:12:19.885 --> 00:12:23.483\nNow we're gonna start pushing out those\nconfigurations to the end users, or\n\n225\n00:12:23.483 --> 00:12:26.266\ncomputers in this case or\neverybody in the domain, right?\n\n226\n00:12:26.266 --> 00:12:28.390\n>> Exactly right Wes.\n\n227\n00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.419\n>> All right,\nnow the next thing we want to talk about.\n\n228\n00:12:29.419 --> 00:12:30.356\nWe've talked about the link.\n\n229\n00:12:30.356 --> 00:12:33.104\nAgain, I'm gonna come back and\ntalk about the whole in force thing.\n\n230\n00:12:33.104 --> 00:12:37.135\nBut it's not gonna make a lot of sense\nuntil we understand the way these policies\n\n231\n00:12:37.135 --> 00:12:38.352\nactually get applied.\n\n232\n00:12:38.352 --> 00:12:43.059\nSo the next thing we want to talk about\nis what's called the processing order.\n\n233\n00:12:43.059 --> 00:12:47.058\nThis is extremely important whenever\nworking with group policies.\n\n234\n00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:51.350\nBecause it's gonna determine\nwhat the net result is.\n\n235\n00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.527\nAs you can see,\nwe can link several policies.\n\n236\n00:12:53.527 --> 00:12:55.864\nMost organizations are gonna have many,\n\n237\n00:12:55.864 --> 00:12:59.211\nmany policies that they use\nto implement configurations.\n\n238\n00:12:59.211 --> 00:13:01.520\nWe can link them at different locations.\n\n239\n00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.618\nSite, domain, and organizational unit.\n\n240\n00:13:04.618 --> 00:13:08.645\nWhen a computer starts up,\nor when a user logs on.\n\n241\n00:13:08.645 --> 00:13:11.560\nIt's gonna look and take all\nthe policies that apply to it, and\n\n242\n00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.218\nit's gonna apply those settings.\n\n243\n00:13:13.218 --> 00:13:18.059\nWell, how does it know which ones\nto apply and which settings?\n\n244\n00:13:18.059 --> 00:13:21.715\nEspecially if there's\nconflicting settings, right?\n\n245\n00:13:21.715 --> 00:13:25.596\nWhat if in one policy, and in fact we'll\ndo a little example here as we go through.\n\n246\n00:13:25.596 --> 00:13:29.317\nWe can have multiple policies and those\npolicies might conflict with each other.\n\n247\n00:13:29.317 --> 00:13:30.664\nI might have a policy.\n\n248\n00:13:30.664 --> 00:13:32.483\nIn fact,\nlet's do a little quick demo here.\n\n249\n00:13:32.483 --> 00:13:34.017\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n250\n00:13:34.017 --> 00:13:38.551\ndelete a couple of these links just\nto kind of clean things up here.\n\n251\n00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:42.173\nSo we'll get rid of that and\nwe'll get rid of that one.\n\n252\n00:13:42.173 --> 00:13:48.535\nAnd let's say I want to make a policy\nthat sets the screen saver time out.\n\n253\n00:13:48.535 --> 00:13:50.116\nIt's an easy one to go and verify.\n\n254\n00:13:50.116 --> 00:13:52.480\nThat's why I always use\nthat one as my example.\n\n255\n00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:59.538\nAll right, so I'll create a new GPO,\nand I'll say screen saver settings.\n\n256\n00:13:59.538 --> 00:14:04.003\nAll right, and then I'm gonna go ahead and\nlink that up to the domain itself.\n\n257\n00:14:04.003 --> 00:14:07.779\nSo I'm gonna right-click on lab,\nlink an existing GPL,\n\n258\n00:14:07.779 --> 00:14:11.491\nscreen saver settings, and\nI'll go ahead and click OK.\n\n259\n00:14:11.491 --> 00:14:14.350\nAll right, and\nthat will kind of get us started.\n\n260\n00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:17.438\nIn fact, let's go in here and\nlet's go ahead and edit this.\n\n261\n00:14:17.438 --> 00:14:19.864\nI'm gonna right-click edit.\n\n262\n00:14:19.864 --> 00:14:23.689\nGonna go down to users, policies,\nadministrative settings, or\n\n263\n00:14:23.689 --> 00:14:25.408\nadministrative templates.\n\n264\n00:14:25.408 --> 00:14:28.013\nControl panel, personalization, and\n\n265\n00:14:28.013 --> 00:14:33.460\nI'm going to set the screen saver\ntime-out to, we're gonna enable it.\n\n266\n00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:38.158\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nset it to ten minutes, or 600 seconds.\n\n267\n00:14:38.158 --> 00:14:42.324\nAnd I also wanna password\nprotect the screensaver.\n\n268\n00:14:42.324 --> 00:14:45.941\nSo somewhere in here ba, ba, there we go,\npassword protect the screensaver.\n\n269\n00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:48.866\nWe'll choose enable and we'll click okay.\n\n270\n00:14:48.866 --> 00:14:52.120\nSo, I've got two settings there\nthat I've enabled in this policy.\n\n271\n00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.576\nPassword protect the screesaver.\n\n272\n00:14:53.576 --> 00:14:55.659\nSo when it wakes up, they're gonna\nhave to type in their password.\n\n273\n00:14:55.659 --> 00:15:00.148\nAnd the screen saver time out is set\nto 600 hundred seconds or ten minutes.\n\n274\n00:15:00.148 --> 00:15:02.195\nAnd I'll go ahead and close that.\n\n275\n00:15:02.195 --> 00:15:04.204\nAll right, and\nI linked it to the domain itself.\n\n276\n00:15:04.204 --> 00:15:09.884\nSo it's gonna inherit down on everybody,\nand everything inside that domain.\n\n277\n00:15:09.884 --> 00:15:10.542\nAll right.\n\n278\n00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:12.256\nNow back to the processing order and\n\n279\n00:15:12.256 --> 00:15:14.895\nwill continue on with our\nlittle demonstration here.\n\n280\n00:15:14.895 --> 00:15:19.626\nThe processing order is gonna\nbe local then site and domain,\n\n281\n00:15:19.626 --> 00:15:22.700\nand then organizational unit, or OU.\n\n282\n00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.860\nLSDO that's what you need to memorize.\n\n283\n00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.130\nRemember every Windows\nmachine has a local policy.\n\n284\n00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.930\nThose are always gonna be applied first.\n\n285\n00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:36.464\nThen any policies that are linked\nto the site would be applied next.\n\n286\n00:15:36.464 --> 00:15:39.345\nThen policies linked to\nthe domain are applied.\n\n287\n00:15:39.345 --> 00:15:42.132\nAnd then policies linked\nto the OU are applied.\n\n288\n00:15:42.132 --> 00:15:46.156\nAnd then if there's any nested\nOU's we would continue on down and\n\n289\n00:15:46.156 --> 00:15:48.070\napply those policies as well.\n\n290\n00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:52.042\nNow, when we apply these policies,\nyou can think of them as being layered.\n\n291\n00:15:52.042 --> 00:15:55.545\nFirst we're gonna lay down all\nthe settings that are in the local policy.\n\n292\n00:15:55.545 --> 00:15:59.451\nAnd then on top of that we're gonna lay\ndown all the settings in that domain\n\n293\n00:15:59.451 --> 00:16:00.717\npolicy, or policies.\n\n294\n00:16:00.717 --> 00:16:03.400\nAnd then the, I'm sorry the local\nthen the site policies.\n\n295\n00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.350\nThen the domain policies on top of that.\n\n296\n00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:09.250\nAnd then the OU policies,\nand then any nested OUs.\n\n297\n00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.352\nThe reason that order is so\nimportant, is because as policies get\n\n298\n00:16:15.352 --> 00:16:20.372\napplied they can override setting\nthat were previously applied.\n\n299\n00:16:20.372 --> 00:16:27.009\nFor example, let's say at the domain I\nset a screensaver timeout of ten minutes.\n\n300\n00:16:27.009 --> 00:16:32.772\nBut then at the OU I set\nthe screensaver timeout to 15 minutes.\n\n301\n00:16:32.772 --> 00:16:36.188\nWell, when that machine starts up and\nthat user logs on,\n\n302\n00:16:36.188 --> 00:16:40.111\nwe're gonna see that local,\nthen site, then domain, then OU.\n\n303\n00:16:40.111 --> 00:16:42.490\nLocal didn't say anything\nabout the screen saver.\n\n304\n00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.760\nSite didn't say anything\nabout the screen saver.\n\n305\n00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.180\nDomain said, set it to ten minutes.\n\n306\n00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.176\nSo now, the screen saver's ten minutes.\n\n307\n00:16:48.176 --> 00:16:52.165\nBut then, the OU policy gets applied,\nand it says, no,\n\n308\n00:16:52.165 --> 00:16:55.255\nno, no, the screen saver is 15 minutes.\n\n309\n00:16:55.255 --> 00:16:58.111\nBecause that is applied\nafter the domain policy,\n\n310\n00:16:58.111 --> 00:17:02.194\nthe end result is going to be Be\na 15-minute screen saver time-out.\n\n311\n00:17:02.194 --> 00:17:07.022\nBecause the policies that are applied\nlater are gonna override any settings\n\n312\n00:17:07.022 --> 00:17:08.687\nfrom previous policies.\n\n313\n00:17:08.687 --> 00:17:11.435\nSo hopefully that makes sense and\nthat's why that's so important.\n\n314\n00:17:11.435 --> 00:17:14.390\n>> Yeah definitely.\n\n315\n00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.469\nNow in that concept of scope,\nas we are narrowing everything down.\n\n316\n00:17:16.469 --> 00:17:20.767\nMike, it looks like that the closer you\nget to where that object actually exists,\n\n317\n00:17:20.767 --> 00:17:25.020\nwhatever it is, whether it's a computer,\nwhether it's a user, a group.\n\n318\n00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:29.997\nIt looks like, with the OU, the closer you\nget to where it actually resides within\n\n319\n00:17:29.997 --> 00:17:35.063\nActive Directory, is going to be, it\nseems like the highest precedent's value.\n\n320\n00:17:35.063 --> 00:17:38.071\nAnd it's gonna be the one that wins out,\nif you say the trump card if you will.\n\n321\n00:17:38.071 --> 00:17:39.221\n>> It is, and by default,\n\n322\n00:17:39.221 --> 00:17:41.988\nthere are ways we can tweak that\na little bit if we need to.\n\n323\n00:17:41.988 --> 00:17:44.283\nBy default, that's exactly right.\n\n324\n00:17:44.283 --> 00:17:45.212\nThink about this.\n\n325\n00:17:45.212 --> 00:17:47.273\nI'm in a domain environment, and\n\n326\n00:17:47.273 --> 00:17:51.547\nI need to apply my configuration\nsettings to all my machines out there.\n\n327\n00:17:51.547 --> 00:17:54.909\nWhat if that user is a local\nadmin on there machine?\n\n328\n00:17:54.909 --> 00:17:59.310\nCould they go to their local policy and\nsay, you know what?\n\n329\n00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.200\nI don't like what Mike's\npushing out to my machine.\n\n330\n00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.620\nHe wants me to password\nprotect the screen saver.\n\n331\n00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:07.109\nAnd I hate having to type my password\nin every time I wake the machine up.\n\n332\n00:18:07.109 --> 00:18:09.835\nSo I'm gonna go to my local policy, and\n\n333\n00:18:09.835 --> 00:18:13.910\nI'm gonna disable the password\nprotected screensaver.\n\n334\n00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:15.480\nThat way I don't have to do it.\n\n335\n00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.060\nThat's not gonna work, right?\n\n336\n00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.997\nBecause the local policy applies first.\n\n337\n00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:21.321\nThen site, then domain.\n\n338\n00:18:21.321 --> 00:18:25.468\nMy settings from the domain are gonna\noverride those local settings cuz they\n\n339\n00:18:25.468 --> 00:18:26.750\nwere applied first.\n\n340\n00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:27.597\nAll right.\n\n341\n00:18:27.597 --> 00:18:32.527\nSo that way that local policy can't be\nused to override corporate settings\n\n342\n00:18:32.527 --> 00:18:36.609\nconfigurated group policies that\nwe set at the domain level.\n\n343\n00:18:36.609 --> 00:18:40.000\nAnd as Wes said right, I've got some\nsettings that are pretty general I want.\n\n344\n00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.035\nI wanna apply them to everybody out there.\n\n345\n00:18:42.035 --> 00:18:44.829\nSo I can set it at the domain level and\nbe good.\n\n346\n00:18:44.829 --> 00:18:47.090\nBut those settings don't work for\nthe people in the development OU.\n\n347\n00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.890\nSo I can link a policy there at\nthe development OU that conflicts,\n\n348\n00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:58.240\nnot conflicts, but will override those\nsettings at the domain environment.\n\n349\n00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.957\nAll right?\nLike the other day I used the example of\n\n350\n00:19:00.957 --> 00:19:05.208\nprevent access to regedit, and\nI wanna do that across the board.\n\n351\n00:19:05.208 --> 00:19:06.180\nEverybody.\n\n352\n00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.980\nAll right?\nSo at the domain level.\n\n353\n00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:13.274\nI create a GPO that, enable prevent\naccess to registry editing tools.\n\n354\n00:19:13.274 --> 00:19:16.970\nBut my developers need regedit so\nthey can create programs and\n\n355\n00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.612\ndo their magic back there.\n\n356\n00:19:18.612 --> 00:19:22.492\nWell, I've already applied that setting\nto everybody in the domain, but\n\n357\n00:19:22.492 --> 00:19:24.905\nI can go to the OU that\ncontains my developers.\n\n358\n00:19:24.905 --> 00:19:28.887\nAnd I can create a second policy that\ndisables prevent access to registry\n\n359\n00:19:28.887 --> 00:19:30.150\nediting.\n\n360\n00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.881\nSo If you're in that OU,\nthe domain policy applies to everybody and\n\n361\n00:19:33.881 --> 00:19:35.000\nit blocks regedit.\n\n362\n00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.648\nBut then if you're in that OU, that OU\npolicy applies after the domain policy.\n\n363\n00:19:39.648 --> 00:19:43.400\nAnd it's gonna turn around and say no,\nyou do have access to regedit.\n\n364\n00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.140\nBut only if you're in that OU.\n\n365\n00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.190\nEverybody else in the domain no\nlonger has access to regedit.\n\n366\n00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:53.170\nSo we've gotta understand that order\nthat they get applied in because that's\n\n367\n00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.062\ngonna change the end result.\n\n368\n00:19:55.062 --> 00:19:55.999\nIf I flipped it around.\n\n369\n00:19:55.999 --> 00:19:59.184\nIf I said apply the OU policies\nfirst then the domain policy,\n\n370\n00:19:59.184 --> 00:20:02.257\nmy developers wouldn't have\naccess to regedit, right?\n\n371\n00:20:02.257 --> 00:20:05.227\nBecause the OU policy would say,\nhere you go, you have access.\n\n372\n00:20:05.227 --> 00:20:08.039\nBut then the domain policy would\nturn around and say, nope,\n\n373\n00:20:08.039 --> 00:20:09.592\nyou don't have access, right?\n\n374\n00:20:09.592 --> 00:20:14.700\nSo the order that these are applied\naffects the end result.\n\n375\n00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.489\nSomething we call\nthe resultant set of policy.\n\n376\n00:20:17.489 --> 00:20:20.412\nIn the end, all these different\npolicies being applied.\n\n377\n00:20:20.412 --> 00:20:22.968\nSome of them conflicting with others and\nthings like that.\n\n378\n00:20:22.968 --> 00:20:25.010\nWhat's the end result?\n\n379\n00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:28.731\nWhat settings do I end up with when\nthis user logs onto this machine?\n\n380\n00:20:28.731 --> 00:20:30.362\nThat's our resultant set of policy.\n\n381\n00:20:30.362 --> 00:20:33.203\nAnd we've got many things we\nneed to talk about with that.\n\n382\n00:20:33.203 --> 00:20:34.782\nSo we'll just table that for now.\n\n383\n00:20:34.782 --> 00:20:39.478\nBut I wanted to go ahead and get that term\nout there, that results instead of policy.\n\n384\n00:20:39.478 --> 00:20:40.455\nAll right, so.\n\n385\n00:20:40.455 --> 00:20:47.430\nSo far with our order we've got local,\nthen site, then domain, and then OU.\n\n386\n00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.241\nIn fact we can, we can see this.\n\n387\n00:20:49.241 --> 00:20:50.363\nIf we take a look here.\n\n388\n00:20:50.363 --> 00:20:55.037\nI've got that screensaver settings And\nlet's go down to the developer's OU, and\n\n389\n00:20:55.037 --> 00:20:59.175\nI'm gonna show you another trick that\nI don't think I Have shown you yet,\n\n390\n00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:03.225\nyou've seen me create a GPO and\nthen turn around and link the GPO.\n\n391\n00:21:03.225 --> 00:21:08.275\nAnd in many organizations, we've talked\nabout delegation and about permissions.\n\n392\n00:21:08.275 --> 00:21:11.025\nI can give somebody\npermission to create a GPO.\n\n393\n00:21:11.025 --> 00:21:13.005\nI can give somebody\npermission to link a GPO.\n\n394\n00:21:13.005 --> 00:21:14.335\nThey're not the same, right?\n\n395\n00:21:14.335 --> 00:21:15.685\nIf you can create it, that's great, but\n\n396\n00:21:15.685 --> 00:21:19.105\nthat doesn't automatically give\nyou the ability to link it.\n\n397\n00:21:19.105 --> 00:21:21.547\nIf you can link it,\nthat's a permission you can have.\n\n398\n00:21:21.547 --> 00:21:23.698\nBut that doesn't give you\nthe ability to create it.\n\n399\n00:21:23.698 --> 00:21:25.840\nSo we can separate out those duties.\n\n400\n00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.405\nWe can have one group of people\nresponsible for creating and testing them.\n\n401\n00:21:29.405 --> 00:21:33.766\nAnother group of people responsible for\nactually putting them in production and\n\n402\n00:21:33.766 --> 00:21:34.607\nlinking them.\n\n403\n00:21:34.607 --> 00:21:37.833\nIf you happen to have both permissions\nlike I do because I'm logged onto\n\n404\n00:21:37.833 --> 00:21:38.435\nthe domain.\n\n405\n00:21:38.435 --> 00:21:40.647\nI can create it and\nlink it at the same time.\n\n406\n00:21:40.647 --> 00:21:42.635\nRight, I can save myself a little work.\n\n407\n00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:45.866\nI can right click on those developers OU,\nand\n\n408\n00:21:45.866 --> 00:21:50.095\nI can create a GPO in this domain And\nlink it here.\n\n409\n00:21:50.095 --> 00:21:55.133\nNow we said that at the domain level I set\nthe screensaver timeout to ten minutes,\n\n410\n00:21:55.133 --> 00:21:55.660\nright?\n\n411\n00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.376\nFor this one,\nI'm just gonna put Dev Policy,\n\n412\n00:21:59.376 --> 00:22:02.625\nsomething like that, we'll click OK.\n\n413\n00:22:02.625 --> 00:22:07.475\nAnd notice that it linked the GPO,\nand it created it, right?\n\n414\n00:22:07.475 --> 00:22:10.711\nIt's down here, it did show up\nin my group policy objects and\n\n415\n00:22:10.711 --> 00:22:12.795\nit linked it at the same time.\n\n416\n00:22:12.795 --> 00:22:15.219\nAnd we'll go here and edit this guy.\n\n417\n00:22:15.219 --> 00:22:18.092\nAnd we're gonna go to that same setting.\n\n418\n00:22:18.092 --> 00:22:22.040\nSo, Administrative Templates,\nControl Panel,\n\n419\n00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:27.101\nPersonalization, Screen Saver Timeout,\nwe'll enable that.\n\n420\n00:22:27.101 --> 00:22:33.000\nAnd we're going to give them,\njust to keep my math simple, 20 minutes.\n\n421\n00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.904\nWe'll do 1,200 seconds, right?\n\n422\n00:22:34.904 --> 00:22:36.252\n600 seconds was ten minutes.\n\n423\n00:22:36.252 --> 00:22:38.535\nSo 1,200 seconds should be, 20 minutes.\n\n424\n00:22:38.535 --> 00:22:39.485\nSo Sounds good to me.\n\n425\n00:22:39.485 --> 00:22:40.162\nI like it.\n\n426\n00:22:40.162 --> 00:22:42.019\nIf my math is off, you have to forgive me.\n\n427\n00:22:42.019 --> 00:22:46.477\nAll right, we'll click OK there, and\nwe'll go ahead and close the editor.\n\n428\n00:22:46.477 --> 00:22:49.356\nAll right, so now what's gonna happen?\n\n429\n00:22:49.356 --> 00:22:53.259\nAnybody in the domain logs on,\nthey're gonna have a 600 second or\n\n430\n00:22:53.259 --> 00:22:57.585\na ten minute screensaver time out,\nunless you're in the developer's OU.\n\n431\n00:22:57.585 --> 00:23:01.179\nAnd then this policy is gonna\napply after the domain policy.\n\n432\n00:23:01.179 --> 00:23:05.670\nAnd you'll get a 20 minute\nscreensaver time out, right?\n\n433\n00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:07.717\nNow we can actually see this.\n\n434\n00:23:07.717 --> 00:23:11.410\nWhen you click on one of these links\nyou get some tabs here that show you\n\n435\n00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:14.796\nthe scope, the details,\nthe settings, and the delegation.\n\n436\n00:23:14.796 --> 00:23:20.040\nWhen you click on the OU you can see\ninformation about the policies themselves.\n\n437\n00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:26.625\nAnd I'll go back to the scope and\ntabs, but let's look at the OU first.\n\n438\n00:23:26.625 --> 00:23:28.865\nSo when I select that developer's OU.\n\n439\n00:23:28.865 --> 00:23:33.802\nI can see that there is one policy\nlinked to that particular review.\n\n440\n00:23:33.802 --> 00:23:34.915\nYou might think well wait.\n\n441\n00:23:34.915 --> 00:23:37.432\nSo that's it, that's the only\npolicy that applies to that OU.\n\n442\n00:23:37.432 --> 00:23:38.646\nNot true.\n\n443\n00:23:38.646 --> 00:23:40.554\nWe go to group policy inheritance,\n\n444\n00:23:40.554 --> 00:23:44.253\nI'll see there's also the default\nto main policy and screensaver.\n\n445\n00:23:44.253 --> 00:23:46.851\nRemember, those were linked\nup to the domain itself.\n\n446\n00:23:46.851 --> 00:23:51.308\nAnd they're gonna inherit down\nto everything else inside there.\n\n447\n00:23:51.308 --> 00:23:52.010\nAll right.\n\n448\n00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:55.648\nSo in the end, all three of these\npolicies are gonna be applied.\n\n449\n00:23:55.648 --> 00:24:01.037\nAnd it's gonna be local, then site,\nthen domain, and then OU, right?\n\n450\n00:24:01.037 --> 00:24:06.405\nNow that LSDO, local site domain OU,\nis pretty clear.\n\n451\n00:24:06.405 --> 00:24:10.335\nI mean, it's a way that we can see what\norder these policies are gonna be applied.\n\n452\n00:24:10.335 --> 00:24:14.783\nExcept, or unless I have more than one\npolicy linked to the same location.\n\n453\n00:24:14.783 --> 00:24:16.456\nNow what happens, right?\n\n454\n00:24:16.456 --> 00:24:18.573\nLet's go back to the developers here.\n\n455\n00:24:18.573 --> 00:24:22.588\nAnd I'm going to create another GPO and\n\n456\n00:24:22.588 --> 00:24:26.974\nI'll call it, I don't know, Dev seven.\n\n457\n00:24:26.974 --> 00:24:29.896\nLet's just call it Dev, all right?\n\n458\n00:24:29.896 --> 00:24:33.631\nSo now I've got two policies\nlinked to the same OU.\n\n459\n00:24:33.631 --> 00:24:36.112\nWell local site to the main\nOU doesn't help me,\n\n460\n00:24:36.112 --> 00:24:39.291\ndoesn't tell me which ones at\nthe OU level go first, right?\n\n461\n00:24:39.291 --> 00:24:43.311\nAnd that's very important because of\nthe order they're applied determine who\n\n462\n00:24:43.311 --> 00:24:45.533\nwins In the event of\na conflicting setting.\n\n463\n00:24:45.533 --> 00:24:49.590\nSo when I look at these late group policy\nobjects I can now see that there are two\n\n464\n00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:50.475\nbeing applied.\n\n465\n00:24:50.475 --> 00:24:51.916\nThere are two that are linked here.\n\n466\n00:24:51.916 --> 00:24:54.796\nAnd notice they have\nthis little link order.\n\n467\n00:24:54.796 --> 00:24:56.885\nThat's known as the president.\n\n468\n00:24:56.885 --> 00:25:01.469\nAnd this is how we're going to determine\nwhich policies are applied first when\n\n469\n00:25:01.469 --> 00:25:03.702\nwe're talking about the same level.\n\n470\n00:25:03.702 --> 00:25:07.315\nLike at the domain, or at the OU or\nat the site or what have you.\n\n471\n00:25:07.315 --> 00:25:08.945\nAnd I can change this.\n\n472\n00:25:08.945 --> 00:25:12.168\nThe lower the number,\nthe higher precedence.\n\n473\n00:25:12.168 --> 00:25:15.348\nIt's backwards, it's just the way\nMicrosoft always does things.\n\n474\n00:25:15.348 --> 00:25:19.320\nSo the lower the number,\nthe higher the precedent,\n\n475\n00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:24.111\nwhich means a link order of one\nhas a higher precedent than two.\n\n476\n00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:28.566\nThey're gonna be applied from\nthe biggest number to the lowest number.\n\n477\n00:25:28.566 --> 00:25:30.610\nThe lowest number is applied last.\n\n478\n00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:33.628\nSo in this case,\ndev is gonna be applied first.\n\n479\n00:25:33.628 --> 00:25:37.845\nAnd then dev policy is gonna be applied,\nall right?\n\n480\n00:25:37.845 --> 00:25:39.033\nBecause of the way they're linked.\n\n481\n00:25:39.033 --> 00:25:40.335\nI linked this one first.\n\n482\n00:25:40.335 --> 00:25:42.208\nIt automatically got a precedent of one.\n\n483\n00:25:42.208 --> 00:25:44.903\nIf this one was linked second\nit got a precedent of two.\n\n484\n00:25:44.903 --> 00:25:46.853\nBut I'm not stuck with that, all right.\n\n485\n00:25:46.853 --> 00:25:48.617\nWhat if I want to change it around.\n\n486\n00:25:48.617 --> 00:25:54.424\nI can use my little arrows and now notice\ndev is first and dev policy is second.\n\n487\n00:25:54.424 --> 00:25:58.242\nSo we can change the order\nof those policies.\n\n488\n00:25:58.242 --> 00:25:59.786\nNow, I can control.\n\n489\n00:25:59.786 --> 00:26:03.735\nWe already know local site domain OU,\nthat's set, we can't change that.\n\n490\n00:26:03.735 --> 00:26:07.186\nBut when more than one policy\nis linked to the same level.\n\n491\n00:26:07.186 --> 00:26:10.349\nI can control which policies apply first,\nor\n\n492\n00:26:10.349 --> 00:26:16.193\nwhat order those policies are applied by\nchanging the precedent or the link order.\n\n493\n00:26:16.193 --> 00:26:19.441\nThe same thing's going on up at\nthe domain, there's two policies up here,\n\n494\n00:26:19.441 --> 00:26:21.845\ndefault, the main policy,\nand screensaver setting.\n\n495\n00:26:21.845 --> 00:26:24.596\nWhich one's getting applied first?\n\n496\n00:26:24.596 --> 00:26:27.215\nAll right?\nThere could be conflicting settings.\n\n497\n00:26:27.215 --> 00:26:31.613\nWhat if, in the default of the main\npolicy, I set the screen saver timeout to\n\n498\n00:26:31.613 --> 00:26:34.941\nfive minutes and\nin screen savers I set it to ten minutes.\n\n499\n00:26:34.941 --> 00:26:35.790\nWhich one wins?\n\n500\n00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:37.701\nThey're both linked to domain.\n\n501\n00:26:37.701 --> 00:26:39.883\nSo local site domain OU doesn't help me.\n\n502\n00:26:39.883 --> 00:26:42.577\nThat's, again,\nwhen that precedent comes into play.\n\n503\n00:26:42.577 --> 00:26:45.435\nWe can look at the inheritance tab, and\n\n504\n00:26:45.435 --> 00:26:50.377\nI can see that the domain policy's\nwe're applying first, right.\n\n505\n00:26:50.377 --> 00:26:52.699\nHigher number,\nthey're gonna get applied first.\n\n506\n00:26:52.699 --> 00:26:55.439\nAnd it's actually gonna apply\nscreensaver settings first.\n\n507\n00:26:55.439 --> 00:27:00.408\nThen default domain policy,\nthen dev policy, and then dev.\n\n508\n00:27:00.408 --> 00:27:03.408\nWell what if I wanna change default\ndomain policy and screensaver?\n\n509\n00:27:03.408 --> 00:27:06.737\nBoth linked at the domain,\nI wanna change the order they're applied.\n\n510\n00:27:06.737 --> 00:27:10.677\nI want the default domain policy\napplied first, and then screensaver.\n\n511\n00:27:10.677 --> 00:27:14.021\nWell I don't have any little\nhandy dandy arrows over here.\n\n512\n00:27:14.021 --> 00:27:17.643\nThat's because these aren't linked\nat this OU that I have selected.\n\n513\n00:27:17.643 --> 00:27:23.541\nYou can see these are being inherited\nfrom lab it.protv the domain itself.\n\n514\n00:27:23.541 --> 00:27:28.092\nSo in order to change there other I\nwould need to go to where there linked.\n\n515\n00:27:28.092 --> 00:27:32.686\nI can go up to the domain itself and\ngo to link group policy objects and\n\n516\n00:27:32.686 --> 00:27:34.547\nnow I can change the order.\n\n517\n00:27:34.547 --> 00:27:38.542\nSo I can take that screen saver,\nmove it up, now to fall.\n\n518\n00:27:38.542 --> 00:27:41.932\nDomain policy applies first,\nthen screensaver.\n\n519\n00:27:41.932 --> 00:27:46.174\nIf I go back to developers,\nI see that change occurs here too.\n\n520\n00:27:46.174 --> 00:27:51.117\nFirst, default domain policy,\nthen screensavers, then dev policy,\n\n521\n00:27:51.117 --> 00:27:52.099\nand then dev.\n\n522\n00:27:52.099 --> 00:27:55.756\nSo when we look at those links,\nthose links are really important, right?\n\n523\n00:27:55.756 --> 00:27:56.919\nThey're their own object.\n\n524\n00:27:56.919 --> 00:27:59.523\nThey've got their own set of,\nwell they've got a couple of properties,\n\n525\n00:27:59.523 --> 00:28:00.868\nthey don't have tons of properties.\n\n526\n00:28:00.868 --> 00:28:03.397\nBut they are separate from the GPO.\n\n527\n00:28:03.397 --> 00:28:07.554\nAnd it controls,\nwe use those links to scope our policies,\n\n528\n00:28:07.554 --> 00:28:10.558\nto determine who those policies apply to.\n\n529\n00:28:10.558 --> 00:28:12.371\nSo we've gotta know that processing order.\n\n530\n00:28:12.371 --> 00:28:17.319\nWe've gotta know local site domain OU,\nand then we've gotta understand that at\n\n531\n00:28:17.319 --> 00:28:21.409\neach level we have that precedent\nvalue that we can set by default.\n\n532\n00:28:21.409 --> 00:28:23.862\nDetermined by the order\nthe policies are linked.\n\n533\n00:28:23.862 --> 00:28:26.602\nIf you put the first policy you\nlink goes on the top of the list.\n\n534\n00:28:26.602 --> 00:28:28.552\nThe second policy you link goes next.\n\n535\n00:28:28.552 --> 00:28:29.575\nAnd so on and so forth.\n\n536\n00:28:29.575 --> 00:28:31.061\nBut we can rearrange those.\n\n537\n00:28:31.061 --> 00:28:32.547\nAnd it's important that we do.\n\n538\n00:28:32.547 --> 00:28:36.635\nSo that we can determine or\nwe can affect the outcome, right?\n\n539\n00:28:36.635 --> 00:28:38.773\nAs those policies get laid down.\n\n540\n00:28:38.773 --> 00:28:41.977\nSo a lot of information there,\nWes, dealing with those links.\n\n541\n00:28:41.977 --> 00:28:44.858\n>> That's right, I tell you Mike,\nthanks for that good information.\n\n542\n00:28:44.858 --> 00:28:47.590\nRemember some of the things that\nwe've talked about in this episode is\n\n543\n00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:48.202\ndetermining.\n\n544\n00:28:48.202 --> 00:28:50.291\nWho does the policy apply through?\n\n545\n00:28:50.291 --> 00:28:52.197\nThrough scoping and finding out.\n\n546\n00:28:52.197 --> 00:28:55.631\nIf you've got a If you have computers\nmaking sure that it's going to\n\n547\n00:28:55.631 --> 00:28:57.026\napply to the right people.\n\n548\n00:28:57.026 --> 00:29:00.568\nWe've talked about links, how to turn\non the light switch, if you will,\n\n549\n00:29:00.568 --> 00:29:01.206\nto your GPO.\n\n550\n00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:03.085\nSo that you can make sure\nthat they're in effect.\n\n551\n00:29:03.085 --> 00:29:04.015\nAlso, the processing order.\n\n552\n00:29:04.015 --> 00:29:07.959\nWhen we throw the chips out on the table,\nnot the chips but the cards.\n\n553\n00:29:07.959 --> 00:29:09.770\nAnd we want to figure\nout what is applying.\n\n554\n00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:13.299\nYou gotta know that precedence and\nthat processing order.\n\n555\n00:29:13.299 --> 00:29:16.366\nBut it looks like we have a lot\nmore information to come.\n\n556\n00:29:16.366 --> 00:29:18.827\nBut we've run to the end of this episode.\n\n557\n00:29:18.827 --> 00:29:20.918\nSo we're gonna move into a part two.\n\n558\n00:29:20.918 --> 00:29:23.985\nAnd if any of the terminology within\nthis episode might have confused you.\n\n559\n00:29:23.985 --> 00:29:27.076\nGo back and watch some of the earlier\nepisodes that we already have on tap\n\n560\n00:29:27.076 --> 00:29:27.702\nfor you guys.\n\n561\n00:29:27.702 --> 00:29:29.985\nBut looks like we're gonna\nwrap this one up, Mike.\n\n562\n00:29:29.985 --> 00:29:32.262\nThank you, and\nlooking forward to the part two here.\n\n563\n00:29:32.262 --> 00:29:37.266\nBut we'll go ahead and signing off for\nITProTv, I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n564\n00:29:37.266 --> 00:29:38.104\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n565\n00:29:38.104 --> 00:29:38.756\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n566\n00:29:38.756 --> 00:29:46.450\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

They look at the processing order that Group Policy uses to determine which settings will be applied and how Group Policy handles settings conflicts. They discuss Group Policy inheritance and how to block settings from being inherited and enforce settings in Active Directory. They talk about when Group Policy settings apply and how to force the application of Group Policy settings through GPUpdate with the \"force\". They talk about the components that apply the settings found in a GPOS call Client-side Extensions(CSEs)",

00:00:19.151\nI'm your host Wes Brian and on today's\nepisode we're going to be moving along and\n\n4\n00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:22.067\nworking with group policy and\ntoday what are we doing here,\n\n5\n00:00:22.067 --> 00:00:24.720\nwe're talking about group\npolicy scope the sequel.\n\n6\n00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.322\nThat's right part two.\n\n7\n00:00:26.322 --> 00:00:30.795\nSo if you haven't seen part one go back\nand definitely check that out, but\n\n8\n00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:35.415\nwe have Mr.Mike Roderick in the house\ntoday to explain some more concepts in\n\n9\n00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:36.726\ngroup policy scope.\n\n10\n00:00:36.726 --> 00:00:37.446\nHow're you doing today, Mike?\n\n11\n00:00:37.446 --> 00:00:39.256\n>> I'm doing great Wes, glad to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:39.256 --> 00:00:42.208\nAnd your exactly right,\nwe're going to continue our discussion on\n\n13\n00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.344\nscope because there's\na lot more to talk about.\n\n14\n00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:47.367\nYou know so\nfar we've seen how we can link a policy.\n\n15\n00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:50.365\nAnd that's really how we determine\nwhat the scope in that policy is.\n\n16\n00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:52.243\nOr who that policy applies to,\n\n17\n00:00:52.243 --> 00:00:55.719\nby linking it to a certain\nlocation in active directory.\n\n18\n00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.449\nEither at the site level,\nat the domain level, or at the OU.\n\n19\n00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:00.075\nRight?\nAnd\n\n20\n00:01:00.075 --> 00:01:02.850\nthat's gonna determine who\nthat policy applies to.\n\n21\n00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.834\nBut there is a little more to that.\n\n22\n00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:08.102\nWe started taking a look at\nprecedents because that LSDO,\n\n23\n00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:11.410\nlocal site domain OU,\ngets us a long way, but\n\n24\n00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.955\nwe can have more than one policy\nlinked to this same location.\n\n25\n00:01:15.955 --> 00:01:17.651\nAnd so LSDO doesn't help us.\n\n26\n00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:20.785\nIn that case, that's when we have\nto look at that precedent number.\n\n27\n00:01:20.785 --> 00:01:24.430\nBy default, it's just the order\nthat they were linked in.\n\n28\n00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.678\nThe lower the number,\nthe higher the precedent.\n\n29\n00:01:26.678 --> 00:01:28.913\nSo when applies to those policies,\n\n30\n00:01:28.913 --> 00:01:32.794\nI've got three policies linked\nat that OU level for example.\n\n31\n00:01:32.794 --> 00:01:39.498\nThe third one, the link order three,\napplies first and then two and then one.\n\n32\n00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:41.215\nThe lower the number,\nthe higher the precedent.\n\n33\n00:01:41.215 --> 00:01:45.631\nThe higher the precedent, it applies last,\ncan override the previous policy.\n\n34\n00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:49.883\nBut there's a few other things that\nwe've got to take a look at and I think\n\n35\n00:01:49.883 --> 00:01:54.574\nwe'll start doing some actual testing\nhere, so we can see some of the results.\n\n36\n00:01:54.574 --> 00:01:57.262\nAnd we haven't really done that yet\nin this show,\n\n37\n00:01:57.262 --> 00:01:59.252\nso we'll take a look at that as well.\n\n38\n00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:03.471\nLet's take a look at my screen here and\ndo a quick recap of what we've got so far.\n\n39\n00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:08.757\nI've got a policy linked up at the domain\nlevel called screen saver settings,\n\n40\n00:02:08.757 --> 00:02:14.616\nand that one was gonna set that screen\nsaver timeout to 10 minutes, 600 seconds.\n\n41\n00:02:14.616 --> 00:02:19.555\nGot another policy down here called dev\npolicy linked to the developer's OU.\n\n42\n00:02:19.555 --> 00:02:25.227\nAnd that was gonna set that screen\nsaver to 1200 seconds or 20 minutes.\n\n43\n00:02:25.227 --> 00:02:26.642\nThis one we had just created,\n\n44\n00:02:26.642 --> 00:02:29.766\nI'm just gonna delete that one to\nkinda clean our screen up here.\n\n45\n00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:33.757\nAnd now what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna go log on as somebody\n\n46\n00:02:33.757 --> 00:02:35.641\nthat's in the host's OU.\n\n47\n00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:37.860\nSo let's see what happens here.\n\n48\n00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.992\nWell I think I've got a client.\n\n49\n00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:40.432\nThere we go.\n\n50\n00:02:40.432 --> 00:02:46.149\nWe'll do a little back arrow here, and\nwe'll choose, how about Mr. Wesley Brian.\n\n51\n00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:50.490\nWhoops, that's not your password, Wes,\nlet me tell you what your password is.\n\n52\n00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.210\nAll right.\n\n53\n00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.021\nWes is in that host, so you are going to,\nif we wanted to verify,\n\n54\n00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:59.170\nbecause I know you guys don't believe\nme when I tell you this stuff.\n\n55\n00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.950\nIf I go tools and active directory,\nusers and computers,\n\n56\n00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.160\nwe'll go down to employees and G and\nB and host, and there's Wes Bryant.\n\n57\n00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.220\nSo that's where his user account resides.\n\n58\n00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.430\nSo when Wes logs on and you see he's\nlogged on for the first time here,\n\n59\n00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.380\nhe's learning how to use Windows 8.\n\n60\n00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.791\nWe will switch over the desktop,\nwe'll right click on that background and\n\n61\n00:03:20.791 --> 00:03:25.133\nchoose personalize and we're going to\ngo into that screensaver and there\n\n62\n00:03:25.133 --> 00:03:29.683\nI can see that it's set to ten minutes\nbecause that's what that policy said,\n\n63\n00:03:29.683 --> 00:03:32.718\nset their screen saver\ntimeout to 600 seconds.\n\n64\n00:03:32.718 --> 00:03:34.435\nNotice it's also grayed out.\n\n65\n00:03:34.435 --> 00:03:36.596\nWe're going to come back and\ntalk about that, but\n\n66\n00:03:36.596 --> 00:03:38.661\nthat's a very important\npart of group policy.\n\n67\n00:03:38.661 --> 00:03:40.070\nWes can't change it.\n\n68\n00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.690\n>> I don't like that policy,\n\n69\n00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.611\nyou're just blocking me from being able\nto do everything, spoil all of my fun.\n\n70\n00:03:44.611 --> 00:03:47.619\n>> [LAUGH] That's right, we're going\nto take away all of your capabilities.\n\n71\n00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:49.360\nAll right, so Wes, and\nthat makes sense, right?\n\n72\n00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.330\nThere's a policy linked to\nthe domain that says 600 seconds.\n\n73\n00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.351\nWes is part of the domain.\n\n74\n00:03:54.351 --> 00:03:56.630\nHe logs in and sure enough,\n600 seconds it is.\n\n75\n00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.703\nAll right, now I'm going to log off.\n\n76\n00:04:00.703 --> 00:04:04.931\nWe'll just log off as Wes here, and great\nchoice of your background by the way.\n\n77\n00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:07.790\n>> Thank you.\n>> Yeah, you're welcome.\n\n78\n00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.890\n[LAUGH] And\nwe're going to log on as another user,\n\n79\n00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.744\nand this time we're\ngoing to log on as Rob.\n\n80\n00:04:11.744 --> 00:04:15.877\nRob is in that development OU.\n\n81\n00:04:15.877 --> 00:04:16.481\nYou guys believe me?\n\n82\n00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:17.038\nDo I have to go look?\n\n83\n00:04:17.038 --> 00:04:18.896\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You guys believe me, right?\n\n84\n00:04:18.896 --> 00:04:22.076\nAnd let me get rid of\nthese crazy arrows here.\n\n85\n00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:26.036\nWe're going to go over to that desktop,\nwe're going to right click and\n\n86\n00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:29.270\nchoose personalize,\nwe're going to go to screen saver.\n\n87\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.996\nAnd sure enough, Rob has 20 minutes.\n\n88\n00:04:31.996 --> 00:04:34.131\nAnd that should make sense\nto you guys now, right?\n\n89\n00:04:34.131 --> 00:04:37.151\nBecause we know the way\npolicies are applied.\n\n90\n00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:41.290\nFirst, local, then site,\nthen domain, then OU.\n\n91\n00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.130\nAt the domain, set the screen\nsaver timeout to 600 seconds but\n\n92\n00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.097\nat the developer's OU it\nset it to 1200 seconds.\n\n93\n00:04:50.097 --> 00:04:56.067\nBecause that's applied later, it overrides\nthe settings from the domain level and\n\n94\n00:04:56.067 --> 00:05:00.955\nhe ends up with that 600,\n1200 second screensaver timeout.\n\n95\n00:05:00.955 --> 00:05:04.135\n>> Now Mike I'm starting to notice\na little bit of a trend here alright.\n\n96\n00:05:04.135 --> 00:05:07.811\nWhen you're talking about your\nLSD O it seems like even if\n\n97\n00:05:07.811 --> 00:05:10.801\nyou modify precedence\nyou had talked about and\n\n98\n00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:14.631\nmaybe changing links that\nare linked at the same location,\n\n99\n00:05:14.631 --> 00:05:19.637\nit seems like whatever applies last,\nseems to have the highest precedence.\n\n100\n00:05:19.637 --> 00:05:22.051\nThe last one that's applied basically.\n\n101\n00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:22.864\n>> It's exactly right.\n\n102\n00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:24.977\nWhat's happening is they're being applied.\n\n103\n00:05:24.977 --> 00:05:26.975\nI like to think them as layers, right?\n\n104\n00:05:26.975 --> 00:05:29.552\nAs we're putting one down on\ntop of the other and what I've\n\n105\n00:05:29.552 --> 00:05:32.876\ngot here is a just a little diagram,\nI don't think this is the one I wanted.\n\n106\n00:05:32.876 --> 00:05:36.452\nBut local, yeah, that is not the one.\n\n107\n00:05:36.452 --> 00:05:38.588\nThere we go,\nthat's the one I was looking for.\n\n108\n00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:40.858\nThis will kind of give you\na little bit of a visual,\n\n109\n00:05:40.858 --> 00:05:44.663\nbecause sometimes it is hard to grasp it\nwhen we're just verbalizing everything.\n\n110\n00:05:44.663 --> 00:05:48.843\nBut remember,\nthe processing order is going to be local,\n\n111\n00:05:48.843 --> 00:05:51.670\nthen site, then domain, and then OU.\n\n112\n00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.240\nAs Wes was saying there,\nthey're layered on top of each other.\n\n113\n00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.176\nSo you can imagine if the local policy set\nthe screen saver timeout to 30 minutes,the\n\n114\n00:06:00.176 --> 00:06:04.570\nsite didn't say anything about the screen\nsaver timeout the domain said 10\n\n115\n00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.355\nminutes of a policy linked at\nthe domain level said 10 minutes but\n\n116\n00:06:08.355 --> 00:06:10.743\nthen on the OU level it said 15 minutes.\n\n117\n00:06:10.743 --> 00:06:15.370\nThe end result all things considered,\nI get 15 minutes.\n\n118\n00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:20.161\nBecause its the last policy that said\nanything about what the screen saver\n\n119\n00:06:20.161 --> 00:06:21.480\ntimeout should be.\n\n120\n00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.590\nSo it's that last policy that applies win.\n\n121\n00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.283\nBut, I want you to also understand that\nit only overrides that one setting.\n\n122\n00:06:30.283 --> 00:06:34.853\nIn other words, the policy link at\nthe OU doesn't wipe out everything\n\n123\n00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:37.961\nlinked at the domain level,\nor the site level.\n\n124\n00:06:37.961 --> 00:06:40.051\nOnly if there's conflicting settings.\n\n125\n00:06:40.051 --> 00:06:42.131\nNotice that on the domain level,\n\n126\n00:06:42.131 --> 00:06:45.781\nmy policy also said to password\nprotect the screen saver.\n\n127\n00:06:45.781 --> 00:06:48.169\nAt the OU level,\nit didn't say anything about whether or\n\n128\n00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:50.600\nnot I had to password\nprotect the screen saver.\n\n129\n00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.304\nSo you see how that yes made\nit all the way through?\n\n130\n00:06:53.304 --> 00:06:57.273\nNothing after it, no policies applied\nafter that domain based policy said\n\n131\n00:06:57.273 --> 00:07:00.175\nanything about password\nprotected the screen saver.\n\n132\n00:07:00.175 --> 00:07:02.357\nSo that setting makes\nit all the way through.\n\n133\n00:07:02.357 --> 00:07:07.486\nYet the 10 minutes that the domain policy\nsaid, got overridden by this OU policy.\n\n134\n00:07:07.486 --> 00:07:09.646\nSo it's on a per policy basis.\n\n135\n00:07:09.646 --> 00:07:12.780\nRemember, policy setting, not GPO.\n\n136\n00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.731\nIt doesn't override the entire GPO, it\noverrides that one policy setting, right?\n\n137\n00:07:17.731 --> 00:07:22.156\nSo that's why I'm saying, it can get\nvery complex trying to figure out\n\n138\n00:07:22.156 --> 00:07:25.340\nwhat settings actually make\nit down to the bottom.\n\n139\n00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.309\nBecause you've got dozens of policies\npotentially that are just getting layered\n\n140\n00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:33.047\non top of each other one after the other,\nwhich one conflicts with which one,\n\n141\n00:07:33.047 --> 00:07:34.098\nwhat set, you know?\n\n142\n00:07:34.098 --> 00:07:38.812\nThat's why this RSOP is so\nimportant because that's the end result.\n\n143\n00:07:38.812 --> 00:07:41.204\nTake everything into consideration,\nand show me what you got.\n\n144\n00:07:41.204 --> 00:07:44.095\nAnd we got some really tools that\nwe can use to figure that out,\n\n145\n00:07:44.095 --> 00:07:47.554\nwe're gonna save those for you, so\nthat's your cliffhanger for later.\n\n146\n00:07:47.554 --> 00:07:49.468\n>> I was gonna say,\nwe probably would need,\n\n147\n00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:52.753\nI know I would need some tools like\nthat because if you're not careful,\n\n148\n00:07:52.753 --> 00:07:56.365\nthe settings that you think you've defined\nit seems like at the end of the day,\n\n149\n00:07:56.365 --> 00:07:59.265\nthose might not be the settings\nthat are applying to the user and\n\n150\n00:07:59.265 --> 00:08:02.440\nyou could give them it seems like\nmore access than maybe they need, or\n\n151\n00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.615\nmaybe a little bit too\nrestrictive an access.\n\n152\n00:08:04.615 --> 00:08:07.908\n>> Absolutely, it's easy to get them\nmessed up, it's easy to put a policy in\n\n153\n00:08:07.908 --> 00:08:11.573\nthe wrong order, and one overrides the\nother, and the settings, you're getting\n\n154\n00:08:11.573 --> 00:08:14.737\nthat end users calling you up and\nsaying, you know, why do I have this?\n\n155\n00:08:14.737 --> 00:08:17.444\nYou've got to go in there and\ntrouble shoot for them and figure out,\n\n156\n00:08:17.444 --> 00:08:18.453\nwhy is this not working?\n\n157\n00:08:18.453 --> 00:08:20.984\nWhy is it not giving them\nthe setting they need?\n\n158\n00:08:20.984 --> 00:08:23.945\nAnd we just have to start looking at\nthe order those policies are applied,\n\n159\n00:08:23.945 --> 00:08:26.954\nwe have to look at that precedences,\nand then there's some other things,\n\n160\n00:08:26.954 --> 00:08:30.534\njust to make it even more complex, there's\nother things we've gotta throw in the mix.\n\n161\n00:08:30.534 --> 00:08:34.935\nWe haven't even talked about, enforcing\npolicies of blocking inheritance, or\n\n162\n00:08:34.935 --> 00:08:36.028\npermissions even.\n\n163\n00:08:36.028 --> 00:08:38.072\nThat could be another thing,\nthat we've gotta worry about.\n\n164\n00:08:38.072 --> 00:08:41.671\nSo, we still got a long way to go,\ntalking about scoping policies.\n\n165\n00:08:41.671 --> 00:08:45.338\n>> Yeah, no it sounds like you could get\nin just as much as trouble, when I say\n\n166\n00:08:45.338 --> 00:08:49.125\ntrouble I just you know the fact that\nit's not the setting that you want, but\n\n167\n00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:53.150\nit looks like when you talk about things\nlike share permissions and NTFS we really\n\n168\n00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.232\ngot to pay attention to what we're doing\nbecause if we don't the way they override\n\n169\n00:08:57.232 --> 00:09:00.957\neach other it just looks like we could be\nin for a bad day at the office here and\n\n170\n00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:04.679\nbe troubleshooting more than we're\nactually benefitting our network.\n\n171\n00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:05.352\n>> Absolutely.\n\n172\n00:09:05.352 --> 00:09:07.325\nIt's a challenge.\n\n173\n00:09:07.325 --> 00:09:10.666\nLuckily, like I said, there are some\nreally good tools we can use to kind of\n\n174\n00:09:10.666 --> 00:09:12.485\nhelp us work through this and planning.\n\n175\n00:09:12.485 --> 00:09:13.423\nPlanning and\n\n176\n00:09:13.423 --> 00:09:18.802\ndocumentation is key to maintaining\na good group policy infrastructure.\n\n177\n00:09:18.802 --> 00:09:19.638\nAll right.\nNext thing, Wes.\n\n178\n00:09:19.638 --> 00:09:22.563\nI think we need to talk about,\nI mean we talked about precedence,\n\n179\n00:09:22.563 --> 00:09:24.490\nwe talked a little bit about inheritance.\n\n180\n00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:25.535\nWhere did I leave off there?\n\n181\n00:09:25.535 --> 00:09:27.950\nLet's talk about blocking inheritance.\n\n182\n00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.930\nAll right?\n\n183\n00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.590\nWe can block inheritance just\nlike we can with NTFS permission.\n\n184\n00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.410\nWe always try to set it at\nthe highest level possible so\n\n185\n00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.925\nwe have the least work to do.\n\n186\n00:09:38.925 --> 00:09:41.108\nAnd let inheritance take\ncare of everything.\n\n187\n00:09:41.108 --> 00:09:44.544\nBut sometimes we need to\nchange that default behavior.\n\n188\n00:09:44.544 --> 00:09:47.051\nAnd that's where blocking\ninheritance comes into play.\n\n189\n00:09:47.051 --> 00:09:51.115\nNow blocking inheritance\nis a property of the OU.\n\n190\n00:09:51.115 --> 00:09:53.227\nIt's not a property of the link.\n\n191\n00:09:53.227 --> 00:09:55.178\nIt's a property of the OU.\n\n192\n00:09:55.178 --> 00:10:00.310\nRemember I've got a property linked to\nthe domain called screen saver settings.\n\n193\n00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.722\nThat's going to inherit down\neverything inside here.\n\n194\n00:10:03.722 --> 00:10:07.635\nLet's say the guys in London,\nthose developers,\n\n195\n00:10:07.635 --> 00:10:11.734\nI don't want that setting\napplying to them, right?\n\n196\n00:10:11.734 --> 00:10:14.034\nI don't want that policy applying to them.\n\n197\n00:10:14.034 --> 00:10:16.920\nWell one of the ways I could do it,\nor yeah.\n\n198\n00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.870\nLet's use the London developers here,\nor we'll do the New York developers.\n\n199\n00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.647\nIt doesn't really matter,\nI just confuse myself.\n\n200\n00:10:24.647 --> 00:10:26.419\nAll we have to do if I\ndon't want that policy,\n\n201\n00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:28.203\nfirst let's see that\nit is being inherited.\n\n202\n00:10:28.203 --> 00:10:33.155\nSo if I go to the group policy inheritance\ntab, I can see that those two policies\n\n203\n00:10:33.155 --> 00:10:36.471\nlinked to the domain\nare inheriting down to that OU.\n\n204\n00:10:36.471 --> 00:10:37.730\nAll right.\n\n205\n00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:42.310\nWell, I can go to that developer's OU and\nI can right click on it, and\n\n206\n00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.740\nI can choose block inheritance.\n\n207\n00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.610\nAnd as soon as I do that,\nnotice those two GPOs disappear.\n\n208\n00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.491\nAnd you'll also see\na little white exclamation\n\n209\n00:10:51.491 --> 00:10:54.018\npoint over here on that developer's OU.\n\n210\n00:10:54.018 --> 00:10:59.030\nAnd that is telling me that those\npolicies are no longer being inherited.\n\n211\n00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.217\nLets go back up here in fact and\nwe'll do it to this developers OU as well.\n\n212\n00:11:02.217 --> 00:11:06.313\nSo same thing here group policy\ninheritance is showing two policies being\n\n213\n00:11:06.313 --> 00:11:10.100\ninherited plus the one policy\nthat's linked directly to the OU.\n\n214\n00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:15.300\nI right click on the OU it's used to block\ninheritance those two policies linked to\n\n215\n00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.550\nthe domain level disappear.\n\n216\n00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:22.410\nThe one that's linked to the developers\nOU itself, that's still there but\n\n217\n00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.940\nthe two that are being inherited are gone.\n\n218\n00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.660\nAlso noticed that it did not ask\nme which policy I wanted to block.\n\n219\n00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:33.120\nWhen you block a policy,\nyou block all of it.\n\n220\n00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.989\nYou don't get to pick and choose, it's\nlike you're building a wall and saying hey\n\n221\n00:11:36.989 --> 00:11:40.581\nI no longer wanna inherit any permissions\nfrom those objects higher than me,\n\n222\n00:11:40.581 --> 00:11:41.149\nall right?\n\n223\n00:11:41.149 --> 00:11:45.001\nYou don't get to say I wanna block\nthis one and not block that one.\n\n224\n00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:48.554\nIt's not a property of the link,\nit's a property of the OU.\n\n225\n00:11:48.554 --> 00:11:53.642\nSo, blocking inheritance blocks\nall policies from being inherited.\n\n226\n00:11:53.642 --> 00:11:57.422\nNow, as soon as I say that, let me show\nyou how you can get around that too\n\n227\n00:11:57.422 --> 00:12:00.580\nbecause [LAUGH] there's a way\nwe can get around Around that.\n\n228\n00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.869\nWhat if, let's say, I've got dozens\nof policies linked to the domain and\n\n229\n00:12:04.869 --> 00:12:09.431\nthey do things like installing software\nand setting basic configurations like\n\n230\n00:12:09.431 --> 00:12:14.080\nscreen saver, password protecting that\nguy, all that good stuff, all right?\n\n231\n00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.700\nBut my developers,\nI need them to have a clean environment.\n\n232\n00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.450\nThey're developing software and\ndoing some R&D, and all of my policies\n\n233\n00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.930\nthat I normally apply to the rest of\nthe people on my network, shouldn't apply\n\n234\n00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.340\nto them because it can cause problems\nwith their development life cycle.\n\n235\n00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.460\nSo what I could do, what we just did\nthere, is we blocked inheritance, right?\n\n236\n00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.990\nI said none of those normal\ndomain policies are going to be\n\n237\n00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:40.000\ninherited down to developer's OU,\nexcept for my screen saver settings.\n\n238\n00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.860\nThat one,\nwell that's not a good one to show.\n\n239\n00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.140\nLet's say I've got another policy,\nlet's just make one real quick.\n\n240\n00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.879\nWe'll link an existing GPL, or\nsorry, let's create one here.\n\n241\n00:12:49.879 --> 00:12:54.254\nLet's create one, and\nwe'll call it Important Settings.\n\n242\n00:12:57.589 --> 00:12:59.100\nAll right.\n\n243\n00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.160\nLet's say that I'm okay blocking all\nof those policies from inheriting down\n\n244\n00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:03.800\nthe developer's OU.\n\n245\n00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.460\nSo I blocked inheritance,\nnone of them are making it down.\n\n246\n00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:12.282\nBut those important settings,\nthat one needs to go to everybody,\n\n247\n00:13:12.282 --> 00:13:14.254\neven the developers, all right?\n\n248\n00:13:14.254 --> 00:13:14.921\nWell, I've got two choices.\n\n249\n00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:19.975\nI could go to the developer's OU and\nlink it directly there,\n\n250\n00:13:19.975 --> 00:13:25.229\neven though it's not being inherited,\nif I linked it directly\n\n251\n00:13:25.229 --> 00:13:31.095\nto the developer's OU, I'm starting\non the other side of the block.\n\n252\n00:13:31.095 --> 00:13:32.530\nRight?\nThe block is here.\n\n253\n00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.730\nNothing's being inherited down, but\n\n254\n00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.590\nI'm linking it to the other side of the\nblock so it's no longer being inherited.\n\n255\n00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:39.590\nIt's directly applied.\n\n256\n00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.770\nRight?\nSo that'd be one option, but\n\n257\n00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.520\nlet's undo that.\n\n258\n00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.310\nAll right.\n\n259\n00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.340\nRemember, I can delete the link\nit does not delete the GPO.\n\n260\n00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:52.456\nThe other option to make sure,\ncuz what if I had blocking inheritance\n\n261\n00:13:52.456 --> 00:13:57.629\nin several different places,\nlike all of my developers?\n\n262\n00:13:57.629 --> 00:14:00.130\nIn all of my developer OUs we've blocked\nthat inheritance so they could have that\n\n263\n00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.140\nnice, clean environment without\nmy normal company policies.\n\n264\n00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.520\nBut now I wanna make sure that\nimportant settings gets to all those\n\n265\n00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.750\ndevelopers in all three\nof those locations.\n\n266\n00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.005\nThat should go to everybody.\n\n267\n00:14:10.005 --> 00:14:12.654\nAgain I could link it to each\none of these places, but\n\n268\n00:14:12.654 --> 00:14:15.379\nnow I've got that GPO link\nto four different places.\n\n269\n00:14:15.379 --> 00:14:19.712\nAnd it just becomes administratively\na little more difficult to keep track of.\n\n270\n00:14:19.712 --> 00:14:24.090\nThe other thing I can do\nis I can enforce the GPO.\n\n271\n00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.921\nBlocking inheritance is\nthe property of the OU.\n\n272\n00:14:26.921 --> 00:14:30.046\nEnforcing the GPO is\nthe property of the link.\n\n273\n00:14:30.046 --> 00:14:31.860\nAll right?\n\n274\n00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:37.230\nSo I can write the click\non this link to enforce and\n\n275\n00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:41.860\nyou'll see that a lock icon appears\non that link and if I go back down to\n\n276\n00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:46.960\nthe developers OU notice that important\nsettings is going right through the block.\n\n277\n00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.880\nThat's what enforcing does, it allows\nus to go right through the block and\n\n278\n00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.225\nit automatically gets\nthe highest [INAUDIBLE].\n\n279\n00:14:54.225 --> 00:14:58.852\nA policy link to the domain, should be\napplied before policies linked to the OU\n\n280\n00:14:58.852 --> 00:15:00.754\nyet look at my [INAUDIBLE] order.\n\n281\n00:15:00.754 --> 00:15:05.617\nIt's applying the dev policy first,\nthen it's applying that policy into\n\n282\n00:15:05.617 --> 00:15:10.633\nthe domain so when you enforce a link\nyou're doing two things, it's going to\n\n283\n00:15:10.633 --> 00:15:15.727\ngo through any block, given these other\nlocations, it's going to go through\n\n284\n00:15:15.727 --> 00:15:20.547\nthose blocks as well, and it automatically\ngets the highest [INAUDIBLE].\n\n285\n00:15:20.547 --> 00:15:23.325\nSo that's what that enforcing does and\n\n286\n00:15:23.325 --> 00:15:27.962\nit's again a property of the link\nitself not a property of the OU.\n\n287\n00:15:27.962 --> 00:15:30.921\nBecause I could have that policy\nlinked to two different locations.\n\n288\n00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:32.587\nLet's undo everything.\n\n289\n00:15:32.587 --> 00:15:34.004\nLet's unlink important settings here.\n\n290\n00:15:34.004 --> 00:15:36.790\nWe're going to un enforce it,\n\n291\n00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:41.837\nwe're going to unlink it, so\nI delete that link there.\n\n292\n00:15:41.837 --> 00:15:42.337\nAll right?\n\n293\n00:15:42.337 --> 00:15:48.050\nAnd let's undo our,\nwell we'll leave the blocks there.\n\n294\n00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.620\nAll right.\n\n295\n00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:53.010\nLet's say I link that same one\nto the individual locations.\n\n296\n00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.003\nI'm gonna link it here.\n\n297\n00:15:56.212 --> 00:15:59.003\nAnd I'm gonna link it\nto the London location.\n\n298\n00:16:02.171 --> 00:16:05.087\nAnd I'm gonna link it to New York City.\n\n299\n00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.870\nLink an existing GPO,\nimportant settings, and okay.\n\n300\n00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:15.907\nNow, I've linked these to the location\nOUs, but the developers are blocking it,\n\n301\n00:16:15.907 --> 00:16:19.629\nso the developers are not\ngoing to see that policy.\n\n302\n00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:22.890\nBut what if I want that policy to apply\nto those developers in New York City?\n\n303\n00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:29.004\nI can come down here and right click\non this link and enforce it, all right?\n\n304\n00:16:29.004 --> 00:16:32.726\nNow the developers in New York City, it's\ngonna go right through their block and\n\n305\n00:16:32.726 --> 00:16:36.628\nthey're gonna get that setting anyway,\neven though we've blocked inheritance.\n\n306\n00:16:36.628 --> 00:16:42.671\nBut not the developers in London, and\nnot the developers in Gainesville, right?\n\n307\n00:16:42.671 --> 00:16:47.550\nBecause it's a property of the link I\nenforce this link, but not this link and\n\n308\n00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.537\nnot this link.\n\n309\n00:16:48.537 --> 00:16:50.288\nAll right?\nSo something to keep in mind that\n\n310\n00:16:50.288 --> 00:16:52.871\nenforcement is a property of the link,\nnot OU and\n\n311\n00:16:52.871 --> 00:16:56.714\nallows me to sometimes enforce the policy\nand make it go through blocks,\n\n312\n00:16:56.714 --> 00:17:00.879\nother places it's linked maybe it's not\nenforced and it still gets blocked.\n\n313\n00:17:00.879 --> 00:17:03.827\n>> Yeah, I'm sure you know\na hundred different ways or\n\n314\n00:17:03.827 --> 00:17:07.120\nscenarios, reasons I should\nsay that you might use this.\n\n315\n00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.940\nOne of the things that comes\nto right to the top of my mind\n\n316\n00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.970\nis that maybe your company\nhas a new security policy.\n\n317\n00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.410\nAll of the sudden they've got some\nsecurity settings that have to be pushed\n\n318\n00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:20.960\nout, regardless of what's already in\nplace in your infrastructure, seems like\n\n319\n00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.210\na really good way by saying hey, we're\ngoing to enforce this, but like you said,\n\n320\n00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:28.190\ngoes right through those blocks, make sure\nthat those security settings are applied,\n\n321\n00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.570\nand you know, just as an example, we're\nnow in compliance with whatever the new\n\n322\n00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.730\nsecurity policy might be, and\nwe don't have to do a lot of extra work.\n\n323\n00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:35.900\n>> That's absolutely right.\n\n324\n00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:40.529\nYou know, we've talked about delegation,\nand I might delegate to the developers\n\n325\n00:17:40.529 --> 00:17:43.712\nthe ability to work with GPOs\nthat are linked to their OU.\n\n326\n00:17:43.712 --> 00:17:46.481\nAnd they might turn on blocking\ninheritance because they want\n\n327\n00:17:46.481 --> 00:17:48.461\nto prevent anything from inheriting down.\n\n328\n00:17:48.461 --> 00:17:51.450\nRight?\n\n329\n00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:52.477\nBut as a corporation,\n\n330\n00:17:52.477 --> 00:17:55.671\nI've got settings that I need to give\nto them no matter what they want.\n\n331\n00:17:55.671 --> 00:17:58.962\nAnd as Wes said,\nthat's a way I can make sure that happens.\n\n332\n00:17:58.962 --> 00:18:02.731\nThey can block inheritance all they want,\n\n333\n00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:06.925\nthis policy is coming through,\nlike it or not.\n\n334\n00:18:06.925 --> 00:18:08.004\nThat's what that enforcing does for me.\n\n335\n00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:10.671\nAll right,\nwe've talked about that processing order.\n\n336\n00:18:10.671 --> 00:18:13.546\nRemember LSDO, local site domain OU.\n\n337\n00:18:13.546 --> 00:18:18.067\nWe talked about how at the OU or at a\nparticular location, the domain or the OU,\n\n338\n00:18:18.067 --> 00:18:20.610\nit comes down to precedence or link order.\n\n339\n00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:24.240\nWe can change that around if we need to.\n\n340\n00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:30.120\nWe solve the inheritance as well as\nbeing able to block that inheritance.\n\n341\n00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:35.194\nAnd we saw how enforcing that link\nis going to go through any blocks\n\n342\n00:18:35.194 --> 00:18:40.005\nas well as you automatically\ngive it the highest precedence.\n\n343\n00:18:40.005 --> 00:18:41.839\nJust in case you're curious,\n\n344\n00:18:41.839 --> 00:18:46.427\nif you have more than one policy that was\nbeing enforced and so you went down and\n\n345\n00:18:46.427 --> 00:18:51.730\nlooked I can still change the order that\nthey're linked wherever they're linked.\n\n346\n00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.814\nRight?\nFor example, let's do this,\n\n347\n00:18:54.814 --> 00:19:00.086\nlet's enforce screensaver and\nenforce the main policy.\n\n348\n00:19:00.086 --> 00:19:04.425\nAll right, so now we're gonna look at\nthis developers OU, those two guys come\n\n349\n00:19:04.425 --> 00:19:09.050\nthrough, because they're enforced they're\ngonna go right through that block.\n\n350\n00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:10.380\nCan I change that order?\n\n351\n00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.190\nAbsolutely.\n\n352\n00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.040\nSame way we did it before.\n\n353\n00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.087\nYou go to where the policies are linked.\n\n354\n00:19:14.087 --> 00:19:16.879\nRight now,\nscreen saver is the last one to apply.\n\n355\n00:19:16.879 --> 00:19:22.212\nSo it's dev policy, and then default\nthe main policy, and then screen savers.\n\n356\n00:19:22.212 --> 00:19:27.264\nIf I come up here, and I flip these\nguys around, and now I go back and\n\n357\n00:19:27.264 --> 00:19:32.962\nlook at developers, notice dev policy\nthen screen saver, then default.\n\n358\n00:19:32.962 --> 00:19:36.133\nSo you can still, even if they're\nenforced, I can still adjust the order\n\n359\n00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:38.962\nthat they are applied in cuz\nagain that's extremely important.\n\n360\n00:19:38.962 --> 00:19:42.454\nIt's all about the way\nthey're layered down and\n\n361\n00:19:42.454 --> 00:19:46.212\nI can change that end result\nby changing that order.\n\n362\n00:19:46.212 --> 00:19:50.938\nAll right let's undo, we're gonna get rid\nof some of this enforcement just to kind\n\n363\n00:19:50.938 --> 00:19:54.516\nof get back to where we can play\nwith some different settings and\n\n364\n00:19:54.516 --> 00:19:58.636\nI will undo my blocking of my inheritance\nhere I think, well actually you\n\n365\n00:19:58.636 --> 00:20:02.785\nknow what let's test that out I'm\ngonna block that inheritance again.\n\n366\n00:20:02.785 --> 00:20:08.372\nWe saw when I logged on as Rob,\nif I can find my client machine,\n\n367\n00:20:08.372 --> 00:20:13.853\nthere it is, that the OU policy\noverrode the domain policy,\n\n368\n00:20:13.853 --> 00:20:17.837\nso I got a 20 minute screen saver timeout.\n\n369\n00:20:17.837 --> 00:20:19.838\nBut now I've blocked inheritance.\n\n370\n00:20:19.838 --> 00:20:20.713\nRight?\n\n371\n00:20:20.713 --> 00:20:22.982\nSo I'm going to log off.\n\n372\n00:20:22.982 --> 00:20:27.800\nAnd we'll log back on as Rob and\n\n373\n00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.430\nwe're gonna talk about why I'm doing\nthat in just a minute as well.\n\n374\n00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.360\nI'm gonna log back on as Rob and what\nscreen saver timeout do you expect to see?\n\n375\n00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.378\nAt the domain I said ten minutes.\n\n376\n00:20:37.378 --> 00:20:39.587\nAt the OU I said 20 minutes.\n\n377\n00:20:39.587 --> 00:20:42.254\nSo we might think 20 minutes\ncuz it's linked to the OU.\n\n378\n00:20:42.254 --> 00:20:46.478\nRemember, I've been forced the one at\ndomain, which means it goes through\n\n379\n00:20:46.478 --> 00:20:50.254\nthe block and it's gonna automatically\nget the highest resident.\n\n380\n00:20:50.254 --> 00:20:51.463\nSo let's see what we end up with.\n\n381\n00:20:51.463 --> 00:20:57.337\nWe'll go to Personalize and we'll go to\nscreen saver, and I still got 20 minutes.\n\n382\n00:20:57.337 --> 00:20:59.296\nLet's go double check on what I did there.\n\n383\n00:20:59.296 --> 00:21:01.546\nI might have unlinked one of those guys.\n\n384\n00:21:01.546 --> 00:21:05.004\nAs we take a look at the developers\nthough, you oh, I didn't enforce it.\n\n385\n00:21:05.004 --> 00:21:10.337\n[LAUGH] I said I enforce it saying it and\ndoing it are two different things.\n\n386\n00:21:10.337 --> 00:21:14.740\nSo let's enforce that and\nnow let's see what happens.\n\n387\n00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:19.160\nSo now developers Screen saver\nautomatically got the highest resident so\n\n388\n00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:27.100\nif we go back in here and\nwe log off as Rob and we log back on.\n\n389\n00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.379\nIt's not happy because I didn't close\nthat window before I logged off.\n\n390\n00:21:30.379 --> 00:21:35.725\nWe'll do Rob get logged in and\nwe'll flip over to our desktop and\n\n391\n00:21:35.725 --> 00:21:39.100\ntake a look at my screen saver settings.\n\n392\n00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.130\nAnd now it's back to ten.\n\n393\n00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.260\nAll right, so\nyou see the effect of that enforcement.\n\n394\n00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.880\nIt goes through the block, and it\nautomatically gets the highest precedent.\n\n395\n00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:59.292\nAll right, so I think Wes, this would\nprobably be a good time to start talking\n\n396\n00:21:59.292 --> 00:22:04.444\nabout, let's go into talking about\nthe way, when these settings are applied,\n\n397\n00:22:04.444 --> 00:22:09.254\nand I know I I'm gonna jump around again\non you Wes so, forgive me for that.\n\n398\n00:22:09.254 --> 00:22:14.296\nBut, we just kind of saw, you saw\nme logging off and logging back on.\n\n399\n00:22:14.296 --> 00:22:17.390\nAnd you might think,\nwell why was he doing that, right?\n\n400\n00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:22.020\nAnd that's because we've gotta understand\nwhen these policies are actually applied.\n\n401\n00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:22.640\nRight?\n\n402\n00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.550\nAnd remember there's two halves to a GPU.\n\n403\n00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:28.910\nThere's a computer half,\ncomputer configuration, and\n\n404\n00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:33.240\nthere's a user half,\nor user configuration.\n\n405\n00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.100\nAnd the settings are applied\nat different times.\n\n406\n00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.470\nEven though it's a single GPU,\nthe way this process works\n\n407\n00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.250\nis that when that computer starts up,\nit's gonna talk to active directory.\n\n408\n00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:46.624\nAnd it's going to ask active directory,\nsay hey I'm starting up,\n\n409\n00:22:46.624 --> 00:22:50.630\ncan you give me a list of policies\nthat I'm supposed to apply.\n\n410\n00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.669\nAnd active directory looks and\nsees where that computer is and\n\n411\n00:22:54.669 --> 00:22:58.796\nwhere that computer is and\nwhat OU is that computer account in.\n\n412\n00:22:58.796 --> 00:23:00.629\nAnd it says, already,\nlet me make you a list.\n\n413\n00:23:00.629 --> 00:23:01.296\nThese are linked to your site.\n\n414\n00:23:01.296 --> 00:23:02.881\nThese are linked to your domain.\n\n415\n00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:04.587\nThese are linked to the OU.\n\n416\n00:23:04.587 --> 00:23:06.071\nThese are linked to OU.\n\n417\n00:23:06.071 --> 00:23:09.549\nSo here's all the policies\nyou're supposed to apply.\n\n418\n00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:12.497\nAnd it gives that computer\nan ordered list, right?\n\n419\n00:23:12.497 --> 00:23:15.702\nNot just a list, but an ordered list,\nbecause it has to apply to them.\n\n420\n00:23:15.702 --> 00:23:16.236\nLocal.\n\n421\n00:23:16.236 --> 00:23:18.232\n>> Site, then domain, then OU.\n\n422\n00:23:18.232 --> 00:23:20.810\nLocal policies are already applied for\nthe local machine.\n\n423\n00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:25.634\nBut then site, domain and\nOU policies, here's your list,\n\n424\n00:23:25.634 --> 00:23:27.725\napply them in this order.\n\n425\n00:23:27.725 --> 00:23:31.471\nThat happens before you ever\nget to the logon screen.\n\n426\n00:23:31.471 --> 00:23:35.721\nNew computer settings are applied\nwhen the computer starts up,\n\n427\n00:23:35.721 --> 00:23:37.776\nit goes through that process.\n\n428\n00:23:37.776 --> 00:23:41.770\nThen when a user logs on,\nthe process is repeated.\n\n429\n00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.674\nNow we're gonna go back to\nActive Directory, cuz here's my password,\n\n430\n00:23:44.674 --> 00:23:45.299\nI wanna logon.\n\n431\n00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:49.617\nYou're gonna logon, here's a list\nof policies you're supposed to\n\n432\n00:23:49.617 --> 00:23:53.638\napply based on where your user\naccount is in Active Directory and\n\n433\n00:23:53.638 --> 00:23:57.304\nhere's the order that you're\nsupposed to apply them in.\n\n434\n00:23:57.304 --> 00:24:01.861\nSo they don't apply until the user, I\ncan't apply any settings until I know what\n\n435\n00:24:01.861 --> 00:24:06.637\nuser's logging on, because it determines\nwhich policies I'm supposed to apply.\n\n436\n00:24:06.637 --> 00:24:08.002\nWhy?\nIf my user account is\n\n437\n00:24:08.002 --> 00:24:12.370\nin the developers OU,\nthen I've got to include those policies.\n\n438\n00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:16.117\nIf I'm in the hosts OU, then those\ndeveloper policies don't apply to me.\n\n439\n00:24:16.117 --> 00:24:18.628\nSo I authenticate and\nthen it builds that list and it says,\n\n440\n00:24:18.628 --> 00:24:21.370\nthese are the policies\nyou're supposed to apply.\n\n441\n00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:24.218\nThese are the ones that\nare scoped to you and\n\n442\n00:24:24.218 --> 00:24:30.013\nhere's the order that you're supposed to\napply them in, but it doesn't stop there.\n\n443\n00:24:30.013 --> 00:24:34.950\nWes, I mean, we can't just,\nif we only applied them once.\n\n444\n00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:37.638\nWhen the computer started up,\nwe apply the computer settings.\n\n445\n00:24:37.638 --> 00:24:41.190\nAnd then when the user logs on,\nwe apply the user settings.\n\n446\n00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.820\nWell, what if I make changes to policies?\n\n447\n00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.660\nWhat if I create new policies?\n\n448\n00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.384\nIf you never reboot that machine,\nif you never logoff,\n\n449\n00:24:49.384 --> 00:24:53.517\nthen you would never see those changes or\nthose new policies.\n\n450\n00:24:53.517 --> 00:24:54.705\nSo what we do or\n\n451\n00:24:54.705 --> 00:25:00.463\nwhat Active Directory does is it\nrefreshes policies periodically.\n\n452\n00:25:00.463 --> 00:25:03.229\nIt goes back and says,\nhey, let's do it again.\n\n453\n00:25:03.229 --> 00:25:06.061\nIt was so much fun the first time,\nlet's reapply policies.\n\n454\n00:25:06.061 --> 00:25:10.941\nBy default, it's every 90 minutes\nwith a random 30 minute offset, so\n\n455\n00:25:10.941 --> 00:25:14.044\nthat not everybody is\ndoing it at the same time.\n\n456\n00:25:14.044 --> 00:25:17.902\nIf we have a power failure and all\nthe machines boot backup at the same time,\n\n457\n00:25:17.902 --> 00:25:22.007\nthat means every 90 minutes all machines\nare checking into refresh policy and\n\n458\n00:25:22.007 --> 00:25:24.901\nthat's maybe too much work for\nthe domain controller.\n\n459\n00:25:24.901 --> 00:25:28.361\nSo, it's 90 minutes with\na random 30 minute offset.\n\n460\n00:25:28.361 --> 00:25:33.177\nSo 90 minutes after you turn\nthat machine on plus or\n\n461\n00:25:33.177 --> 00:25:39.870\nminus 30 minutes, it's going to,\nI shouldn't say, plus or minus.\n\n462\n00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:41.518\nIt's plus 0 to 30 minutes.\n\n463\n00:25:41.518 --> 00:25:46.690\nSo somewhere between 90 and 120,\nif I get my math right there Wes.\n\n464\n00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.018\nBut somewhere between 90 and\na 120 minutes,\n\n465\n00:25:49.018 --> 00:25:52.854\nit's gonna back to that directory and\nsay, hey, I need to reapply policy again.\n\n466\n00:25:52.854 --> 00:25:56.060\nAnd what it's gonna do is,\nit's gonna look and\n\n467\n00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:00.399\nsee if any polices have changed or\nif there are any new policies.\n\n468\n00:26:00.399 --> 00:26:04.285\nAny policies that haven't changed,\nthere's no need to reapply them,\n\n469\n00:26:04.285 --> 00:26:05.889\nit's already applied them.\n\n470\n00:26:05.889 --> 00:26:09.860\nBut it checks in, it does a refresh and\nsays, are there any new policies or\n\n471\n00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:13.846\nhave any of the policies been modified\nsince the last time I applied them?\n\n472\n00:26:13.846 --> 00:26:18.219\nAnd if there are new policies or they've\nbeen changed, it sends them the list and\n\n473\n00:26:18.219 --> 00:26:19.775\nit applies those policies.\n\n474\n00:26:19.775 --> 00:26:25.964\nThen every 90 minutes to 120 minutes after\nthe user logson, the same process occurs.\n\n475\n00:26:25.964 --> 00:26:27.347\nAre there any new policies?\n\n476\n00:26:27.347 --> 00:26:29.578\nAre there any changes\nto existing policies?\n\n477\n00:26:29.578 --> 00:26:31.252\nAnd those times are independent, right?\n\n478\n00:26:31.252 --> 00:26:35.520\nYou might start the computer up at 8\no'clock, but you don't actually logon,\n\n479\n00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.450\ncuz then you go down to\nthe the water fountain and you get\n\n480\n00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:42.993\nto talking about last night's TV show,\nyou don't actually log on until 8:45.\n\n481\n00:26:42.993 --> 00:26:48.124\nSo those times, your machine is now gonna\ndo it at 8 o clock when you started it up\n\n482\n00:26:48.124 --> 00:26:53.123\nand then again at 9:30 plus or\nminus 30 minutes and then 11 o'clock.\n\n483\n00:26:53.123 --> 00:26:57.265\nBut you didn't logon until 8:45,\nso now that's gonna be,\n\n484\n00:26:57.265 --> 00:27:01.496\nI think it's a really bad time,\n10:15, an hour and a half.\n\n485\n00:27:01.496 --> 00:27:04.170\nYou get the idea,\n90 minutes to 120 minutes after that.\n\n486\n00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.320\nSo they are independent of each other.\n\n487\n00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.586\n>> One of the things you've been talking\nabout is controlling settings and\n\n488\n00:27:10.586 --> 00:27:12.202\npushing them out to the computers.\n\n489\n00:27:12.202 --> 00:27:15.251\nBut when it comes to\nthe policy application itself,\n\n490\n00:27:15.251 --> 00:27:17.340\nit seems like it's client driven.\n\n491\n00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:21.735\nIt seems it's like it's actually the\nclient not the domain controller saying,\n\n492\n00:27:21.735 --> 00:27:23.425\nyou will have these settings.\n\n493\n00:27:23.425 --> 00:27:27.282\nIt seems like it's the client itself\nthat's reaching out to the domain\n\n494\n00:27:27.282 --> 00:27:29.670\ncontroller say, do I have to do something?\n\n495\n00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:30.461\n>> Yes and that's exactly right.\n\n496\n00:27:30.461 --> 00:27:34.968\nThe domain controller where Active\nDirectory where group policies is, that's\n\n497\n00:27:34.968 --> 00:27:39.870\nwhat determines what policies should be\napplied but doesn't actually apply them.\n\n498\n00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:42.507\nThat's where my client\nside extensions come in.\n\n499\n00:27:42.507 --> 00:27:46.352\nThe client side extensions\nare the engine on the client side.\n\n500\n00:27:46.352 --> 00:27:50.366\nAnd when I say client, remember,\nI'm not talking Client Operating System.\n\n501\n00:27:50.366 --> 00:27:54.010\nAny machine that's a member of\na domain is a group policy client,\n\n502\n00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:56.407\nincluding the domain controller itself.\n\n503\n00:27:56.407 --> 00:28:00.790\nIt has to be started up,\nyou can logon to a domain controller.\n\n504\n00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:04.579\nSo it has client side extensions that\ntalk to Active Directory and say, hey,\n\n505\n00:28:04.579 --> 00:28:06.696\ngive me the policy I'm supposed to apply.\n\n506\n00:28:06.696 --> 00:28:10.454\nIt's the CSEs that\nactually do the setting.\n\n507\n00:28:10.454 --> 00:28:15.638\nRemember that the policy says,\ngo change this registry key to this value.\n\n508\n00:28:15.638 --> 00:28:19.662\nFind the registry key for\nscreensaver timeout, set it to 600.\n\n509\n00:28:19.662 --> 00:28:24.126\nWell, the client side extension is the one\nthat actually goes into the registry,\n\n510\n00:28:24.126 --> 00:28:27.045\nfinds that key and\nsets that value to 600 seconds.\n\n511\n00:28:27.045 --> 00:28:27.929\n>> Very good.\n\n512\n00:28:27.929 --> 00:28:33.768\nSo, as far as you mentioned something\nlike they don't reapply settings.\n\n513\n00:28:33.768 --> 00:28:37.797\nNow is that more of like a performance\nthing to apply a policy faster,\n\n514\n00:28:37.797 --> 00:28:40.793\nwhy do I have to inspect\nevery individual setting?\n\n515\n00:28:40.793 --> 00:28:42.961\nAnd then potentially,\nlook at the registry and the index and\n\n516\n00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:44.801\nit seems like that's more\nof a performance thing.\n\n517\n00:28:44.801 --> 00:28:48.792\n>> It is really, just looking at\nthe timestamp on the GPO, cuz it knows,\n\n518\n00:28:48.792 --> 00:28:53.547\nit downloaded, it cached a copy of the GPO\nand the CSE is what applied that setting.\n\n519\n00:28:53.547 --> 00:28:57.635\nSo if it gets another list from Active\nDirectory and it says, wait, the timestamp\n\n520\n00:28:57.635 --> 00:29:01.205\non this policy is the same as the\ntimestamp of the last time I applied it.\n\n521\n00:29:01.205 --> 00:29:04.270\nIt doesn't bother applying it again and\nit is just a performance issue.\n\n522\n00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:08.682\nThere's really no reason like if I\nalready made that registry entry,\n\n523\n00:29:08.682 --> 00:29:12.440\nI don't need to go back in and\ndelete it and create it again.\n\n524\n00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.067\nThere's no reason to do that so.\n\n525\n00:29:14.067 --> 00:29:18.991\nIf the policy hadn't changed then\nthere's no reason to reapply it.\n\n526\n00:29:18.991 --> 00:29:21.331\nNow that's the normal behavior,\n\n527\n00:29:21.331 --> 00:29:26.011\nmachine settings every 90 minutes\nafter that machine starts up and\n\n528\n00:29:26.011 --> 00:29:31.014\nthen with the plus 0 to 30 minutes and\nthen 90 minutes after the user,\n\n529\n00:29:31.014 --> 00:29:35.146\ntheir applied when the user logson,\nthe user settings are.\n\n530\n00:29:35.146 --> 00:29:39.179\nAnd then it's gonna be 0 to well,\nmaybe somewhere between 90 and\n\n531\n00:29:39.179 --> 00:29:42.664\n120 after the user logs on,\ntheir gonna be refreshed.\n\n532\n00:29:42.664 --> 00:29:47.120\nAnd so that's why you saw me logging off\nand then logging back on as that user.\n\n533\n00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.881\nBecause I knew that logging, it was a user\nsetting in the GPO and I knew that logging\n\n534\n00:29:51.881 --> 00:29:55.676\noff and logging back on would\ntrigger that refresh policy right,\n\n535\n00:29:55.676 --> 00:29:59.833\nbecause I know that the user settings\nare applied when the user logs on.\n\n536\n00:29:59.833 --> 00:30:02.993\nBut that's not the only way\nthat I can refresh settings.\n\n537\n00:30:02.993 --> 00:30:05.407\nWe can log off, if it's a user setting.\n\n538\n00:30:05.407 --> 00:30:09.308\nI can logoff and log back on,\nI could wait 90 minutes or\n\n539\n00:30:09.308 --> 00:30:14.537\nI can open up a command prompt and\ndo what's called a group policy refresh or\n\n540\n00:30:14.537 --> 00:30:16.880\nGP update is the actual command.\n\n541\n00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.154\nSame thing for the computer settings.\n\n542\n00:30:20.154 --> 00:30:21.456\nWe can force it.\n\n543\n00:30:21.456 --> 00:30:23.824\nLet's say, like we just did.\n\n544\n00:30:23.824 --> 00:30:28.310\nI didn't want to wait around 90 to\n120 minutes, so I chose to logoff and\n\n545\n00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:29.420\nlog back on.\n\n546\n00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:32.820\nIf it was a machine setting,\nI could have rebooted the machine, but\n\n547\n00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.083\nwhat if I can't do that?\n\n548\n00:30:34.083 --> 00:30:39.434\nWhat if I want to test the setting right\nnow, I don't wanna wait 90 to 120 minutes.\n\n549\n00:30:39.434 --> 00:30:43.275\nI can't reboot the machine, because other\npeople are also, say, it was the server.\n\n550\n00:30:43.275 --> 00:30:45.950\nOther people are connected to it and\nthey're accessing files and\n\n551\n00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:49.170\nthings like that, so I can't just reboot\nthat server in the middle of the day.\n\n552\n00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:52.311\nOr if its a user system, they might be\nin the middle of doing something and\n\n553\n00:30:52.311 --> 00:30:54.125\nI can't just reboot that system on them.\n\n554\n00:30:54.125 --> 00:31:00.235\nThat's where we get GP update and\nI can show you.\n\n555\n00:31:00.235 --> 00:31:04.091\nLets do this, lets change screensaver.\n\n556\n00:31:04.091 --> 00:31:08.781\nI'm gonna unenforce this guy,\nwe'll take away that.\n\n557\n00:31:08.781 --> 00:31:12.257\nSo at this point, we're blocking\ninheritance, the developers are should.\n\n558\n00:31:12.257 --> 00:31:17.135\nThe only policy that they are and we can\nrefresh this window to show you that.\n\n559\n00:31:17.135 --> 00:31:21.563\nSo dev policy should be the only one in\neffect, that setting, that screensaver\n\n560\n00:31:21.563 --> 00:31:26.277\ntime out to, gosh, I forget what we've\ndone now, 600 seconds or 10 minutes.\n\n561\n00:31:26.277 --> 00:31:29.372\nBut if I go back over\nhere to Rob's machine and\n\n562\n00:31:29.372 --> 00:31:34.918\nI look at the screensaver timeout,\nit's actually already down to ten minutes.\n\n563\n00:31:34.918 --> 00:31:35.525\nNice.\n\n564\n00:31:35.525 --> 00:31:38.900\nIt might have done a refresh\nrecycle in the background on me,\n\n565\n00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.165\nas we were doing that.\n\n566\n00:31:40.165 --> 00:31:41.233\nLet's do this.\n\n567\n00:31:41.233 --> 00:31:43.930\nLet's go to that dev policy.\n\n568\n00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:47.516\nOh, no, I take that back,\nthey were 20 minutes.\n\n569\n00:31:47.516 --> 00:31:48.402\nWas that right, Wes?\n\n570\n00:31:48.402 --> 00:31:51.421\n10 minutes for everybody,\n20 minutes for the development team.\n\n571\n00:31:51.421 --> 00:31:52.846\nThat's right.\nI'm losing track of what\n\n572\n00:31:52.846 --> 00:31:53.750\nthe heck I'm doing.\n\n573\n00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:59.011\nSo notice it's still at 10 minutes even\nthough I've just removed that policy,\n\n574\n00:31:59.011 --> 00:32:04.070\nbecause the last time it applied applied\nsettings is said to be 20 minutes.\n\n575\n00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.523\nI've removed the policy.\n\n576\n00:32:05.523 --> 00:32:07.475\nNow I could log off and log back on, but\n\n577\n00:32:07.475 --> 00:32:09.980\nwhat if Rob was in the middle\nof doing something?\n\n578\n00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:14.084\nHe had some program running in the\nbackground that he needed to finish and\n\n579\n00:32:14.084 --> 00:32:18.271\nI can't just log him off, but\nI don't wanna wait 90 to 120 minutes.\n\n580\n00:32:18.271 --> 00:32:24.457\nI can open up a command prompt and\nI can do what we call a GP update,\n\n581\n00:32:24.457 --> 00:32:31.350\nthat's GP group policy GP/ and\nthen I'm going to do what call a force.\n\n582\n00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.394\nI'll explain that in\na minute as that refreshes.\n\n583\n00:32:33.394 --> 00:32:37.852\nLet me bump up my font, so you guys can\nsee what I'm typing in the results here.\n\n584\n00:32:41.387 --> 00:32:46.334\nSo I type in gpupdate /force and\nnotice it says, Computer Policy update\n\n585\n00:32:46.334 --> 00:32:50.891\ncompleted successfully,\nUser Policy completed successfully.\n\n586\n00:32:50.891 --> 00:32:55.807\nSo, I'm just manually triggering that\nrefresh process that normally occurs at 90\n\n587\n00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:56.978\nto 120 minutes.\n\n588\n00:32:56.978 --> 00:33:01.412\nI right-click and I take a look at\npersonalize, I go to Screensaver.\n\n589\n00:33:01.412 --> 00:33:02.610\nNotice now it's back to 20 minutes.\n\n590\n00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:08.168\nIt would have eventually gone to 20\nminutes anyway at the normal refresh\n\n591\n00:33:08.168 --> 00:33:11.048\ncycle, but\nthat's just that way I can speed it up.\n\n592\n00:33:11.048 --> 00:33:16.017\nNow that force option, what that does,\nyou can do a GP update without force and\n\n593\n00:33:16.017 --> 00:33:20.611\nit does a normal refresh, which means\nonly policies that have changed or\n\n594\n00:33:20.611 --> 00:33:22.062\nnew would be applied.\n\n595\n00:33:22.062 --> 00:33:26.938\nForce says, reapply all policies\nwhether they've changed or not.\n\n596\n00:33:26.938 --> 00:33:31.207\nAnd I just know from personal experience\nwith Windows that sometimes if I do it\n\n597\n00:33:31.207 --> 00:33:34.238\nwithout the force,\nit doesn't seem to apply policy.\n\n598\n00:33:34.238 --> 00:33:38.610\nEven though the policy has changed,\nit doesn't seem to detect it and apply it.\n\n599\n00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:41.758\nIf I do force, it applies all policies,\nchanged or not and\n\n600\n00:33:41.758 --> 00:33:44.279\nI can get that setting to\nkick in like I like it.\n\n601\n00:33:44.279 --> 00:33:45.255\n>> Very good.\n\n602\n00:33:45.255 --> 00:33:46.741\nA lot of good information, Mike.\n\n603\n00:33:46.741 --> 00:33:47.762\nThank you for that.\n\n604\n00:33:47.762 --> 00:33:51.980\nLooks like we're going to be going\ninto a part three on this one guys,\n\n605\n00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.273\nas we've definitely come\nto the end of this episode.\n\n606\n00:33:55.273 --> 00:33:59.319\nSo if you haven't seen some of the earlier\nepisodes, go back and watch them.\n\n607\n00:33:59.319 --> 00:34:03.743\nBut we've talked about things like\nthe inheritance, enforcing your links,\n\n608\n00:34:03.743 --> 00:34:04.958\nthe layered policy.\n\n609\n00:34:04.958 --> 00:34:05.919\nAnd hopefully,\n\n610\n00:34:05.919 --> 00:34:10.384\nthis is gonna help you get the recipe,\nyour group policy cookbook out there.\n\n611\n00:34:10.384 --> 00:34:13.031\nMike, any other words for\nthis episode here?\n\n612\n00:34:13.031 --> 00:34:14.796\n>> No, I've still got a lot to say.\n\n613\n00:34:14.796 --> 00:34:16.007\n[LAUGH] So we'll just save it for\nthe next time.\n\n614\n00:34:16.007 --> 00:34:17.079\n[LAUGH]\n>> There we go.\n\n615\n00:34:17.079 --> 00:34:19.915\nWell, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this one.\n\n616\n00:34:19.915 --> 00:34:21.312\nI've been your host, Wes Brian.\n\n617\n00:34:21.312 --> 00:34:22.380\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n618\n00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:23.963\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n619\n00:34:23.963 --> 00:34:30.811\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.622\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.622 --> 00:00:20.462\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\nmoving through working with group policy.\n\n5\n00:00:20.462 --> 00:00:24.302\nAnd we're actually talking about\nGroup Policy Scope Part 3.\n\n6\n00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:28.203\nAnd we've got Mr. Mike Roderick here\nto explain some group policy for us.\n\n7\n00:00:28.203 --> 00:00:29.105\nHow're you doing today, Mike?\n\n8\n00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:30.364\n>> Oh, I'm doing great.\n\n9\n00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:34.795\nI'm excited to be here, and yeah, you're\nright, I've been dragging this out, but\n\n10\n00:00:34.795 --> 00:00:38.695\nthere really is a lot that goes into\ndeveloping your group policy strategy.\n\n11\n00:00:38.695 --> 00:00:42.895\nAnd most of that is all around figuring\nout which policies are applied,\n\n12\n00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:47.585\nmaking sure that they're applied properly,\nlooking at the way they combine,\n\n13\n00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:51.514\nright, as we apply the different\nlayers of the different levels.\n\n14\n00:00:51.514 --> 00:00:56.829\nThe site policies, then the domain\npolicies, and then those OU policies and\n\n15\n00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.024\nthis OU, so there's a lot to it,\nit can get rather complex.\n\n16\n00:01:01.024 --> 00:01:04.040\nAnd we've got more to talk about,\nheck, Wes.\n\n17\n00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.251\nOne thing I haven't even talked about\nis move back policy processing,\n\n18\n00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:09.241\nwe'll save that one for\na little bit later.\n\n19\n00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:11.650\n>> Just when you think\nyou've got the order right,\n\n20\n00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.255\nall of a sudden we're gonna put a rock\nin the calm pond of understanding.\n\n21\n00:01:15.255 --> 00:01:17.500\n>> That's right,\nwe'll toss that in this one as well.\n\n22\n00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.297\nSo first thing I want to talk\nabout though is the whole,\n\n23\n00:01:22.297 --> 00:01:25.018\nwhat's a good way to say that.\n\n24\n00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:27.647\nYou guys remember, well, let's go\nlook at it, let me go back over here.\n\n25\n00:01:27.647 --> 00:01:31.872\nI'm logged on as Rob, and I'm gonna pull\nup those screen saver setting again.\n\n26\n00:01:31.872 --> 00:01:35.286\nRemember in part two,\nwe applied a couple settings.\n\n27\n00:01:35.286 --> 00:01:40.077\nWe set the screen saver time out for those\ndeveloper's OU to be 1,200 seconds, or\n\n28\n00:01:40.077 --> 00:01:41.290\n20 minutes.\n\n29\n00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.240\nAnd sure enough, it is, right?\n\n30\n00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.581\nBut notice I can't change it.\n\n31\n00:01:47.581 --> 00:01:49.795\nI can't click on that, it's grayed out.\n\n32\n00:01:49.795 --> 00:01:53.948\nAnd this is an important part\nof those group policies is\n\n33\n00:01:53.948 --> 00:01:58.024\nthe fact that they are what\nwe call enforced, right.\n\n34\n00:01:58.024 --> 00:02:02.574\nIf I've got a setting that I want to\napply to all those machines out there, or\n\n35\n00:02:02.574 --> 00:02:06.698\nall those users out there, or\njust a few users in the Development OU,\n\n36\n00:02:06.698 --> 00:02:11.269\nthose are settings that, as a company,\nwe've decided need to be applied.\n\n37\n00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.130\nI don't want my end users going around and\nturning it off, right.\n\n38\n00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.436\nWhat if I've got a policy that's\ncreating firewall exceptions, or\n\n39\n00:02:18.436 --> 00:02:22.485\nblocking certain ports, and the user says,\nyou know what, I don't wanna do that.\n\n40\n00:02:22.485 --> 00:02:25.066\nThat breaks my game that I wanna\nplay in the middle of the day.\n\n41\n00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:28.682\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nuncheck that or undo that setting.\n\n42\n00:02:28.682 --> 00:02:31.176\nThey cannot when we use policies,\n\n43\n00:02:31.176 --> 00:02:36.687\nthose settings are what we call enforced,\nand it locks the user interface.\n\n44\n00:02:36.687 --> 00:02:40.647\nNow, you'll see I can still pick\nwhat screensaver I want because\n\n45\n00:02:40.647 --> 00:02:43.534\nthe policy didn't specify\nwhat screensaver.\n\n46\n00:02:43.534 --> 00:02:48.206\nAnd evidently on that dev policy, I also\ndidn't password protect the screensaver.\n\n47\n00:02:48.206 --> 00:02:50.596\nSo let's go change a couple\nof those up a little bit and\n\n48\n00:02:50.596 --> 00:02:52.412\nsee how that affects this machine here.\n\n49\n00:02:52.412 --> 00:02:57.076\nI'm going to flip back over, and\nremember we've got the screensaver\n\n50\n00:02:57.076 --> 00:03:01.583\nsettings up here, which is applying\nthat ten minute screensaver,\n\n51\n00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:04.684\nas well as password\nprotect the screensaver.\n\n52\n00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:08.440\nNow a little side note here,\nlet's take a quick detour and\n\n53\n00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.424\ntalk about how I can figure out what\nsettings are involved in these policies,\n\n54\n00:03:13.424 --> 00:03:16.427\nbecause that's a challenge in and\nof itself.\n\n55\n00:03:16.427 --> 00:03:19.793\nLike I'm sitting here, you see me\nstruggling through this show going, wait,\n\n56\n00:03:19.793 --> 00:03:21.059\nwhat did I set in that policy?\n\n57\n00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:24.208\nI think I did 600 seconds\nif I remember right.\n\n58\n00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:25.305\nHow do you remember this?\n\n59\n00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:28.096\nEspecially if you've got dozens and\ndozens of policies.\n\n60\n00:03:28.096 --> 00:03:31.261\nEspecially if you weren't the one\nthat created the policies,\n\n61\n00:03:31.261 --> 00:03:33.419\nhow do you know what\nsettings are in there?\n\n62\n00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:37.853\nWell, I'll tell you, with this new group\npolicy management console, and I say new,\n\n63\n00:03:37.853 --> 00:03:39.941\nit actually came out in circa 2003.\n\n64\n00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:44.415\nBut prior to that, it was a nightmare,\nbecause what we would have to do is we\n\n65\n00:03:44.415 --> 00:03:47.338\nwould have to make nice\ncomments on everything.\n\n66\n00:03:47.338 --> 00:03:51.333\nWhen I take a look at this GPO,\nif I edit this GPO,\n\n67\n00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:56.317\nthere's actually a way that we\ncan add a comment to that guy.\n\n68\n00:03:56.317 --> 00:03:59.272\nAnd it's been so long since I've\ndone that, there, properties.\n\n69\n00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:04.340\nI can go to the comments and I could\nspecify right here what this policy does.\n\n70\n00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.840\nLike say, hey, this policy applies\na 600 second screensaver time out.\n\n71\n00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.511\nThe password to protect the screensaver,\nyou have to document everything,\n\n72\n00:04:12.511 --> 00:04:16.080\nand of course, as admins, we know\nwe're all a little bit lazy sometimes.\n\n73\n00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.820\nIf you didn't document it, the only other\nway to figure out what settings were in\n\n74\n00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.177\nthere would be to actually to start\nopening this up and looking through.\n\n75\n00:04:23.177 --> 00:04:27.908\nAnd you're not going to scroll through\n4,000 plus settings trying to figure out\n\n76\n00:04:27.908 --> 00:04:29.889\nwhat some other admin did, right?\n\n77\n00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.400\nIt was a nightmare.\n\n78\n00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.000\nNow though, starting again with 2003,\n\n79\n00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.930\nwe've got this in this group\npolicy management console.\n\n80\n00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.621\nWe get this settings tab.\n\n81\n00:04:39.621 --> 00:04:41.544\nAnd I can go to this settings tab,\n\n82\n00:04:41.544 --> 00:04:46.305\nand my IE settings are a little bit harsh,\nwe'll go ahead and add that real quick.\n\n83\n00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:49.149\nAnd here, I'm just gonna go ahead and\nclick show all.\n\n84\n00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:52.480\nI can see exactly what settings\nout of those 4,000 plus\n\n85\n00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.022\nsettings are actually enabled or disabled.\n\n86\n00:04:55.022 --> 00:04:58.130\nThe ones that are not configured\naren't gonna show up here.\n\n87\n00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.163\nSo it filters it down to show me just\nthe settings that are configured with this\n\n88\n00:05:02.163 --> 00:05:03.291\nparticular policy.\n\n89\n00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:07.142\nAnd there I can see, password protect\nthe screensaver is turned on, and\n\n90\n00:05:07.142 --> 00:05:11.011\nthe screensaver time out is turned on,\nand it's set to 600 seconds.\n\n91\n00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:15.337\nFantastic, love, I mean this is, when\nthis came out, the admins that were in\n\n92\n00:05:15.337 --> 00:05:19.158\nthe field already were just like\nI mean this is great stuff here.\n\n93\n00:05:19.158 --> 00:05:20.898\nNow if I go to that default domain policy,\n\n94\n00:05:20.898 --> 00:05:22.856\nwhat the heck is in\nthe default domain policy?\n\n95\n00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:24.940\nOh, I can find out.\n\n96\n00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.751\nI can see all the settings that are\nconfigured in that default domain policy\n\n97\n00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:29.669\nfrom right here.\n\n98\n00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.624\nSo it's a beautiful thing.\n\n99\n00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:36.829\nAll right,\nI'm gonna undo this blocking inheritance.\n\n100\n00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:42.749\nSo now at the developer's OU, all of\nmy settings should be coming through,\n\n101\n00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:46.643\nmy domain policies and\nmy screensaver settings.\n\n102\n00:05:46.643 --> 00:05:51.968\nBut because the domain policy said, or\na policy link to the domain, said 600\n\n103\n00:05:51.968 --> 00:05:57.692\nseconds, but the dev policy says 1,200\nseconds for that screensaver timeout,\n\n104\n00:05:57.692 --> 00:06:02.240\nthen I should end up with a 1,200\nsecond screensaver timeout.\n\n105\n00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.422\nI should also have a password protect\nthe screensaver now because I've\n\n106\n00:06:06.422 --> 00:06:11.315\nallowed that screensaver setting policy\nto inherit down to that developer's OU.\n\n107\n00:06:11.315 --> 00:06:14.748\nAll right, so\nI'm going to unblock that policy here.\n\n108\n00:06:14.748 --> 00:06:16.299\nClear the block inheritance,\n\n109\n00:06:16.299 --> 00:06:19.828\nwhich means they should be back to\nhaving all those policies applied.\n\n110\n00:06:19.828 --> 00:06:24.036\nAt the domain level, I've got the 600\nseconds, at the development OU,\n\n111\n00:06:24.036 --> 00:06:26.095\nI've got that 1,200 seconds.\n\n112\n00:06:26.095 --> 00:06:31.194\nBut remember, the domain level, I also\nhave password protect the screensaver\n\n113\n00:06:31.194 --> 00:06:35.928\nthat's not being set at the development\nlevel, or the developer's OU.\n\n114\n00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:40.466\nSo when I unblock that inheritance,\nthat setting is gonna make it through, so\n\n115\n00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:44.481\nnow I should see, remember it was\n20 with no password protection.\n\n116\n00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:49.304\nI am gonna cancel that and\nI'm gonna refresh policy,\n\n117\n00:06:49.304 --> 00:06:55.533\ndo a little gp updates switch force,\nreapply all of those policies.\n\n118\n00:06:55.533 --> 00:06:59.462\nLet that run, and again, it's reaching\nout to active directory, saying, hey,\n\n119\n00:06:59.462 --> 00:07:02.272\ngive me a list of machine policies\nI'm supposed to apply and\n\n120\n00:07:02.272 --> 00:07:05.107\nthen give me a list of user\npolicies I'm supposed to apply.\n\n121\n00:07:05.107 --> 00:07:09.970\nOnce that's finished, we pull up\nthe screensaver and now I've got mine\n\n122\n00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.926\nback to my 20 minutes, as well as my\npassword protect the screensaver.\n\n123\n00:07:14.926 --> 00:07:17.731\nAlthough I might have done that\na little fast, shouldn't it be.\n\n124\n00:07:17.731 --> 00:07:20.470\nOh yeah, the 20 minutes,\nthat's right, overrode,\n\n125\n00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.021\nI forgot we undid the blocking and\nthe inheritance, so that policy wins.\n\n126\n00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:28.042\nThat later applied policy set\nthe screensaver time out to 20 minutes.\n\n127\n00:07:28.042 --> 00:07:31.145\nIt overrode the policy linked\nat the domain level, but\n\n128\n00:07:31.145 --> 00:07:35.395\nbecause that policy that the developer's\nOU said nothing about whether or\n\n129\n00:07:35.395 --> 00:07:38.701\nnot to password protect the screensaver,\nthat setting,\n\n130\n00:07:38.701 --> 00:07:43.000\nwhich was applied at the domain level,\ndoes inherit down to that child OU.\n\n131\n00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.799\nRight?\n\n132\n00:07:43.799 --> 00:07:46.135\nAnd again, it's grayed out.\n\n133\n00:07:46.135 --> 00:07:47.435\nI cannot change it.\n\n134\n00:07:47.435 --> 00:07:48.025\nRight?\n\n135\n00:07:48.025 --> 00:07:52.289\nI can change the screensaver, cuz the\npolicy didn't specify anything about what\n\n136\n00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:55.461\nscreensaver I had to use, but\nI cannot change this, right?\n\n137\n00:07:55.461 --> 00:07:59.747\nSo that's the thing about those policies\nthat says the setting is enforced.\n\n138\n00:07:59.747 --> 00:08:03.887\nThe users cannot, even if I'm an admin,\neven if I was the domain admin, in fact,\n\n139\n00:08:03.887 --> 00:08:05.091\nhere, I'll show you.\n\n140\n00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:08.179\nLet's log off here.\n\n141\n00:08:08.179 --> 00:08:13.929\nAnd we'll just, da, da,\nda, we'll sign out.\n\n142\n00:08:13.929 --> 00:08:18.216\nAnd I'll log back on as the domain admin.\n\n143\n00:08:18.216 --> 00:08:19.374\nI could do whatever I want.\n\n144\n00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:21.242\nI'm the domain admin, right?\n\n145\n00:08:21.242 --> 00:08:27.582\nWell, let's see, personalize,\nscreensaver, and negative.\n\n146\n00:08:27.582 --> 00:08:29.369\nNotice it's ten minutes for\n\n147\n00:08:29.369 --> 00:08:33.027\nthe domain admin because I'm\nnot in the developer's OU.\n\n148\n00:08:33.027 --> 00:08:37.736\nSo that policy that set it to 20\nminutes doesn't apply to me, right,\n\n149\n00:08:37.736 --> 00:08:40.178\nwhen I log onto this machine, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:40.178 --> 00:08:43.104\nAll right, so they are enforced.\n\n151\n00:08:43.104 --> 00:08:47.941\nThey are also, another thing we need\nto understand about these policies is\n\n152\n00:08:47.941 --> 00:08:51.495\nthat if I fall out of scope,\nthe policy will be undone.\n\n153\n00:08:51.495 --> 00:08:55.577\nIn other words,\nlet's see how I could show you this,\n\n154\n00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:59.499\nI'm going to just delete that policy,\nall right?\n\n155\n00:08:59.499 --> 00:09:01.938\nSo right now,\nI'm logged on as a domain admin.\n\n156\n00:09:01.938 --> 00:09:06.549\nTen minutes screensaver time out, on\nresume password protect the screensaver.\n\n157\n00:09:06.549 --> 00:09:10.054\nFlip back over here to my\ndomain controller, and\n\n158\n00:09:10.054 --> 00:09:13.650\nrather than delete it,\nI'm going to disable it.\n\n159\n00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.877\nSomething else we didn't talk about, the\nproperty of the link, I can enable it or\n\n160\n00:09:17.877 --> 00:09:18.563\ndisable it.\n\n161\n00:09:18.563 --> 00:09:21.511\nIf I'm doing this,\nis especially useful for troubleshooting,\n\n162\n00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:24.725\ntrying to figure out what, if I think\nthis policy is causing a problem,\n\n163\n00:09:24.725 --> 00:09:26.508\nI can come in here and disable the link.\n\n164\n00:09:26.508 --> 00:09:31.012\nRemember the link is separate from the\nGPO, so if this policy was linked to four\n\n165\n00:09:31.012 --> 00:09:35.874\ndifferent places, I could disable the link\nin one place but not the others, right?\n\n166\n00:09:35.874 --> 00:09:36.654\nThey're independent.\n\n167\n00:09:36.654 --> 00:09:38.077\nThey're their own objects.\n\n168\n00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:40.210\nBut now that policy's turned off.\n\n169\n00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:46.935\nSo if I come back over here and\nI refresh policy again.\n\n170\n00:09:46.935 --> 00:09:54.159\nA little gpupdate switch force,\nwe'll let that policy refresh,\n\n171\n00:09:54.159 --> 00:10:02.031\nso the policy should no longer be\napplied because it has been turned off.\n\n172\n00:10:02.031 --> 00:10:06.155\nThere we go, we'll go to screensaver, and\nnow I'm back to the default domain policy.\n\n173\n00:10:06.155 --> 00:10:11.661\nOne minute screensaver out, and I can\nchange this one if I want, all right?\n\n174\n00:10:11.661 --> 00:10:18.528\nSo it's no longer in effect because\nthe policy is no longer being applied.\n\n175\n00:10:18.528 --> 00:10:23.998\nSo, with policies, they're enforced, but\nif the policy falls out of scope, if I\n\n176\n00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:29.723\nmove Rob out of the developer's OU, well,\nthat policy should no longer apply to him.\n\n177\n00:10:29.723 --> 00:10:32.851\nHe won't have that 20 minute\nscreensaver time out anymore, right?\n\n178\n00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:36.285\nBecause it's now out of scope for\nRob's account.\n\n179\n00:10:36.285 --> 00:10:39.617\nAnd that's different from preferences.\n\n180\n00:10:39.617 --> 00:10:41.648\nNow, we haven't played\na lot with preferences yet.\n\n181\n00:10:41.648 --> 00:10:44.897\nWe're gonna spend a good amount\nof time on those preferences, but\n\n182\n00:10:44.897 --> 00:10:46.533\nlet's open up this policy here.\n\n183\n00:10:46.533 --> 00:10:50.811\nI'm gonna choose Edit, and remember,\nunderneath Computer, I've got Policies and\n\n184\n00:10:50.811 --> 00:10:52.048\nI've got Preferences.\n\n185\n00:10:52.048 --> 00:10:56.171\nUnder User, I've got Policies and\nI've got Preferences, all right?\n\n186\n00:10:56.171 --> 00:10:58.265\nPolicies are enforced.\n\n187\n00:10:58.265 --> 00:11:02.327\nThey're going to lock the user interface,\nbut if the policy no longer applies to\n\n188\n00:11:02.327 --> 00:11:06.228\nyou, it will undo the lock, and it will\nlet you change it again if you want to.\n\n189\n00:11:06.228 --> 00:11:09.195\nPreferences don't block\nthe user interface.\n\n190\n00:11:09.195 --> 00:11:10.739\nThey're not enforced.\n\n191\n00:11:10.739 --> 00:11:15.192\nI can create a setting using a preference,\nhave it applied to you just like a policy,\n\n192\n00:11:15.192 --> 00:11:17.403\nbut it doesn't lock the user interface.\n\n193\n00:11:17.403 --> 00:11:21.131\nSo if you wanna undo the setting,\nyou're welcome to, but\n\n194\n00:11:21.131 --> 00:11:23.579\nit tattoos the registry, all right?\n\n195\n00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:27.035\nIn other words, if I delete the policy or\nI remove the policy, or\n\n196\n00:11:27.035 --> 00:11:30.691\nit goes out of scope,\nit doesn't automatically undo the setting.\n\n197\n00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:34.754\nAgain, the interface isn't locked so the\nuser can undo the setting any time they\n\n198\n00:11:34.754 --> 00:11:38.533\nwant, but group policy itself is not\ngoing to go back and undo the setting.\n\n199\n00:11:38.533 --> 00:11:41.601\nOnce it applies a preference,\nit says all right, there it is.\n\n200\n00:11:41.601 --> 00:11:45.936\nI'm gonna make that setting in the\nregistry and even if the policy goes away,\n\n201\n00:11:45.936 --> 00:11:49.146\nthat setting is still there\nin the registry, all right?\n\n202\n00:11:49.146 --> 00:11:53.629\nSo key difference between policy\nsettings and preferences,\n\n203\n00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:55.964\npolicy settings are enforced.\n\n204\n00:11:55.964 --> 00:11:58.156\nThey lock the user interface, but\n\n205\n00:11:58.156 --> 00:12:01.794\nthey will be unlocked when\nthe policy falls out of scope.\n\n206\n00:12:01.794 --> 00:12:04.233\nPreferences doesn't lock\nthe user interface.\n\n207\n00:12:04.233 --> 00:12:08.661\nThey're not enforced, but it does\nremain even if the policy is removed.\n\n208\n00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:12.664\nYou would have to manually remove or\nundo that setting.\n\n209\n00:12:12.664 --> 00:12:13.517\n>> That sounds really good.\n\n210\n00:12:13.517 --> 00:12:17.570\nSo if you wanna maybe deploy an initial\nsetting but it's not something that's so\n\n211\n00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.265\ndetrimental that you don't mind users\nchanging it, they can modify it,\n\n212\n00:12:21.265 --> 00:12:22.831\nnot saying it's a good thing.\n\n213\n00:12:22.831 --> 00:12:24.790\n>> Right.\n>> But they would have that ability.\n\n214\n00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:29.131\n>> Yeah, I've worked in an environment\nwhere we pushed out power options.\n\n215\n00:12:29.131 --> 00:12:33.121\nThere are power plants through preferences\nbecause we wanted to make sure that\n\n216\n00:12:33.121 --> 00:12:37.110\nthe screens were going to sleep after\na certain amount of time, the hard drives\n\n217\n00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.632\nwere turning off after a certain\namount of time, trying to be green.\n\n218\n00:12:40.632 --> 00:12:42.903\nBut some of the people on my network,\n\n219\n00:12:42.903 --> 00:12:46.584\nthey needed their machine to stay up,\nlike hosts, right?\n\n220\n00:12:46.584 --> 00:12:49.977\nI can't have my computer going to\nsleep in the middle of a show.\n\n221\n00:12:49.977 --> 00:12:53.147\nSo that ten minutes and\nit goes to sleep isn't gonna work for me.\n\n222\n00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:57.352\nBecause it was a preference, I could go\nin there and change that on my machine.\n\n223\n00:12:57.352 --> 00:12:59.433\nIt's not locking that user interface.\n\n224\n00:12:59.433 --> 00:13:03.015\n>> Sure, so you might have somebody that's\nworking nine to five, right, that maybe\n\n225\n00:13:03.015 --> 00:13:06.612\nyou have a second set of people that come\nin and they're working a little bit later.\n\n226\n00:13:06.612 --> 00:13:10.221\nThat policy, if it was enforced, would\nprobably be a little detrimental to their\n\n227\n00:13:10.221 --> 00:13:13.830\nproductivity for the night staff, and it\ngives them the option if they want to turn\n\n228\n00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.742\naround and\nmodify it later if they need to.\n\n229\n00:13:15.742 --> 00:13:17.186\n>> That's exactly right, got you.\n\n230\n00:13:17.186 --> 00:13:20.018\n>> All right, now the other thing we want\nto talk about here is those good old\n\n231\n00:13:20.018 --> 00:13:21.046\nclient side extensions.\n\n232\n00:13:21.046 --> 00:13:25.001\nWe've mentioned them once before,\nwe said that CSE, that's the acronym\n\n233\n00:13:25.001 --> 00:13:29.234\nthey're gonna use for client side\nextensions, reside on the client machine.\n\n234\n00:13:29.234 --> 00:13:32.484\nAlso remember, I'm not talking\nabout client operating system.\n\n235\n00:13:32.484 --> 00:13:36.272\nEvery Windows operating system\nhas these client side extensions,\n\n236\n00:13:36.272 --> 00:13:39.535\nserver operating systems,\neven my domain controllers.\n\n237\n00:13:39.535 --> 00:13:41.565\nBecause policy applies to them, right?\n\n238\n00:13:41.565 --> 00:13:45.609\nSo they have it, and\nthe CSC is what processes the policies.\n\n239\n00:13:45.609 --> 00:13:47.161\nWhen we talk Active Directory,\n\n240\n00:13:47.161 --> 00:13:50.038\nwe get the list of policies\nthat's supposed to be applied.\n\n241\n00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:54.366\nIt's to the CSE, the client side\nextension, that reads the policy and\n\n242\n00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:57.047\nactually makes the change in the registry.\n\n243\n00:13:57.047 --> 00:13:57.698\nAll right.\n\n244\n00:13:57.698 --> 00:14:01.049\nNow, these client side extensions have\nsome default behaviors associated\n\n245\n00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:01.579\nwith them.\n\n246\n00:14:01.579 --> 00:14:07.096\nMost settings when you refresh policy,\nif they're changed or\n\n247\n00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:12.102\nif there's a new policy,\nthey're gonna reapply them.\n\n248\n00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:18.970\nIf we do the GP update force,\nit reapplies all those settings.\n\n249\n00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.972\nThere are some, however,\nthat don't apply on the refresh cycle.\n\n250\n00:14:22.972 --> 00:14:26.730\nAnd I'm not talking about me running it or\ndoing a manual refresh.\n\n251\n00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.092\nI'm talking about normal, right?\n\n252\n00:14:28.092 --> 00:14:32.200\nYou start the machine up and\nthen every 90 to 120 minutes,\n\n253\n00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.880\nit's gonna reapply policies, right?\n\n254\n00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.880\nIf he's logged on,\nevery 90 to 120 minutes later,\n\n255\n00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:42.170\nit's gonna refresh or\nreapply those policies, except for a few.\n\n256\n00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:46.532\nThere's folder redirection,\nthat only applies when you log on.\n\n257\n00:14:46.532 --> 00:14:49.722\nIt doesn't reapply every refresh cycle.\n\n258\n00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:52.947\nSoftware installation only\nruns when you log on,\n\n259\n00:14:52.947 --> 00:14:55.879\nit doesn't apply during the refresh cycle.\n\n260\n00:14:55.879 --> 00:14:59.840\nSome of them don't apply based\non the link that you have.\n\n261\n00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.765\nAnd let me use a different word,\nbecause we've been using link a lot,\n\n262\n00:15:02.765 --> 00:15:04.412\nthe connection that you have, right?\n\n263\n00:15:04.412 --> 00:15:08.170\nLet's say that I've got a policy\nthat installs Office, all right?\n\n264\n00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:11.994\nThat's a good thing, I don't have to\nrun around from machine to machine and\n\n265\n00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:12.904\ninstall Office.\n\n266\n00:15:12.904 --> 00:15:17.052\nWhat if Wes is on his laptop, I make\nthis policy, Wes happens to dial in,\n\n267\n00:15:17.052 --> 00:15:21.133\nhe's on a road trip, he's doing some\nvideos out in another location.\n\n268\n00:15:21.133 --> 00:15:25.930\nHe has a connection back to work, but\nit's a nice low dial-up connection.\n\n269\n00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:30.548\nDo I really wanna try to push out\nOffice across that dial-up connection?\n\n270\n00:15:30.548 --> 00:15:35.361\nWell, group policy does what\nwe call slow link detection,\n\n271\n00:15:35.361 --> 00:15:39.696\nand by default,\nit's 500 kilobits per second and\n\n272\n00:15:39.696 --> 00:15:45.784\nsome of those client side extensions\nwon't fire if it detects a slow link.\n\n273\n00:15:45.784 --> 00:15:49.523\nAnd that's a good thing, but\nwe can change that if we need to.\n\n274\n00:15:49.523 --> 00:15:52.081\nI might wanna force that\nsoftware to install,\n\n275\n00:15:52.081 --> 00:15:53.993\nwhether you got a slow link or not.\n\n276\n00:15:53.993 --> 00:15:57.020\nOr I can change what a slow link is,\nright?\n\n277\n00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.364\nI don't have to stick with\nthat 500 kilobits per second.\n\n278\n00:15:59.364 --> 00:16:02.738\nLet me pull up, well,\nwe got a policy open right here.\n\n279\n00:16:02.738 --> 00:16:06.226\nI'm just going to expand\nour computer configuration,\n\n280\n00:16:06.226 --> 00:16:10.691\nadministrative templates, system,\nand then group policy, right?\n\n281\n00:16:10.691 --> 00:16:15.099\nAnd if we look in here,\nlet's see if I can find it real quick.\n\n282\n00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:18.750\nWes, there's a lot of settings in here.\n\n283\n00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:25.150\nBum, bum, bum, bum, configure your\nslow link detection, there we go.\n\n284\n00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.760\nSo this one is what specifies\nwhat a slow link is.\n\n285\n00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.654\nI can turn this on and\nnotice the default is 500.\n\n286\n00:16:32.654 --> 00:16:37.594\nMaybe I wanna say anything slower\nthan 1,500 kilobits per second\n\n287\n00:16:37.594 --> 00:16:40.029\nshould be considered a slow link.\n\n288\n00:16:40.029 --> 00:16:42.753\nSo I can change what a slow link is, and\n\n289\n00:16:42.753 --> 00:16:47.790\nthat would in turn change the client\nside exchange behavior, right?\n\n290\n00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:52.205\nNow, all of a sudden, if you don't have\nat least 1,500 kilobits per second,\n\n291\n00:16:52.205 --> 00:16:54.170\nthat software CSE is not gonna fire.\n\n292\n00:16:54.170 --> 00:17:00.549\nSo I can change what a slow link is or\nI can change the CSE behavior itself.\n\n293\n00:17:00.549 --> 00:17:05.242\nThere's a CSE for each major\ncategory of settings in that GPO.\n\n294\n00:17:05.242 --> 00:17:07.213\nLike there's one for ip security.\n\n295\n00:17:07.213 --> 00:17:10.565\nThere's one for the registry settings\non my administrative templates.\n\n296\n00:17:10.565 --> 00:17:11.885\nThere's one for scripts.\n\n297\n00:17:11.885 --> 00:17:14.080\nTheres a client side extension for\nsecurity.\n\n298\n00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.743\nFor wire for wireless, and if I do,\nand there's that one for say,\n\n299\n00:17:18.743 --> 00:17:22.004\nfolder redirection, where's my software?\n\n300\n00:17:22.004 --> 00:17:24.187\nThere's my software\ninstallation policy processor.\n\n301\n00:17:24.187 --> 00:17:28.346\nSo if I wanted to, I could come in\nhere and I could enable it, and\n\n302\n00:17:28.346 --> 00:17:32.130\nI could say allow processing,\neven if it's a slow link.\n\n303\n00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.187\nAll right?\n\n304\n00:17:33.187 --> 00:17:36.600\nProcess even if the group\npolicy objects haven't changed.\n\n305\n00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.932\nSo when it comes to the CSEs,\nI really got two things I can modify.\n\n306\n00:17:39.932 --> 00:17:43.895\nI can change what a slow link is or\nI can change whether or\n\n307\n00:17:43.895 --> 00:17:49.339\nnot it runs when a slow link is detected,\ndepending on which way I wanna go.\n\n308\n00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:53.464\nSo client side extensions, one for\neach major category of settings.\n\n309\n00:17:53.464 --> 00:17:57.608\nThere's a couple of them that will\nnot fire if a slow link is detected.\n\n310\n00:17:57.608 --> 00:18:00.352\nWe can change what a slow link is, or\n\n311\n00:18:00.352 --> 00:18:04.841\nwe can force them to fire,\neven if a slow link is detected.\n\n312\n00:18:04.841 --> 00:18:09.594\nAll right, let's see, Wes,\nwhat else do I need to talk about?\n\n313\n00:18:09.594 --> 00:18:13.473\nI'm trying to think if I, we've covered\na lot of information over these last\n\n314\n00:18:13.473 --> 00:18:16.113\nfew episodes dealing with\nscoping those policies.\n\n315\n00:18:16.113 --> 00:18:18.428\nAnd there is a little more, but\n\n316\n00:18:18.428 --> 00:18:22.981\nI can't think of anything else\nthat we need to hit right now.\n\n317\n00:18:22.981 --> 00:18:23.489\n>> All right.\n\n318\n00:18:23.489 --> 00:18:24.554\nWell, very good.\n\n319\n00:18:24.554 --> 00:18:26.353\nAnd guys, if any of this information,\n\n320\n00:18:26.353 --> 00:18:29.856\nas we're mentioning some of these\nother parts, you say, well, you know?\n\n321\n00:18:29.856 --> 00:18:30.921\nI didn't get to see those parts.\n\n322\n00:18:30.921 --> 00:18:33.562\nWell, go back and watch them again and\nrun through them.\n\n323\n00:18:33.562 --> 00:18:36.950\nAnd any of these,\nmaybe the terminology, as well,\n\n324\n00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.881\nmight be something that\nmight be confusing.\n\n325\n00:18:39.881 --> 00:18:42.859\nGo back and\nwatch some of those earlier episodes, but\n\n326\n00:18:42.859 --> 00:18:45.651\nlooks like we've come to\nthe end of this episode.\n\n327\n00:18:45.651 --> 00:18:51.665\nSo we're gonna go ahead, and we're gonna\ntake the time to sign out here at ITProTV.\n\n328\n00:18:51.665 --> 00:18:53.270\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n329\n00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.042\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n330\n00:18:54.042 --> 00:18:55.737\n>> And

00:00:16.547\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.547 --> 00:00:20.249\nIn today's episode we're gonna be moving\nthrough working with group policy and\n\n5\n00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.089\ntoday we're gonna be talking\nabout filtering group policy.\n\n6\n00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.463\nAnd I have none other\nhere than Mister Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:26.754\nHow we doing today?\n\n8\n00:00:26.754 --> 00:00:27.589\n>> Doing great, Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.180\nI'm excited to be here and\nyou're exactly right,\n\n10\n00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.160\nwe're gonna be talking about filtering,\nor doing some security filtering,\n\n11\n00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.462\non these GPOs, now we've seen on previous\nepisodes, how GPOs are scoped, right?\n\n12\n00:00:38.462 --> 00:00:44.384\nWe can choose to link a GPO to the site,\nto the domain, or to an organization,\n\n13\n00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:49.965\na unit or ou, and most of the time\nthat's perfect, that's all we need.\n\n14\n00:00:49.965 --> 00:00:54.337\nBut there are times when I need a little\nmore granular control over the way those\n\n15\n00:00:54.337 --> 00:00:56.005\ngroup policies are applied.\n\n16\n00:00:56.005 --> 00:01:01.671\nTake for example, a situation where I\ngot an OU that contains a mix of users.\n\n17\n00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:06.188\nMaybe it has all of my sales users,\nas well as my sales managers, and\n\n18\n00:01:06.188 --> 00:01:10.088\nI have got a policy that should\nonly apply to the managers.\n\n19\n00:01:10.088 --> 00:01:12.328\nWell, if I link that policy to the OU,\n\n20\n00:01:12.328 --> 00:01:14.922\nit's going to apply to\neverybody in the OU.\n\n21\n00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:17.339\nHow can I deal with that scenario?\n\n22\n00:01:17.339 --> 00:01:22.755\nOr, if I've got a policy that I want to\napply to users that aren't in the same OU.\n\n23\n00:01:22.755 --> 00:01:26.088\nOr computers, for that matter,\nthat aren't even in the same OU.\n\n24\n00:01:26.088 --> 00:01:27.478\nHow do I configure it so\n\n25\n00:01:27.478 --> 00:01:32.547\nthat it only applies to those users that\nare scattered about in Active Directory?\n\n26\n00:01:32.547 --> 00:01:35.850\nWell, that's where the security\nfiltering comes in.\n\n27\n00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.508\nIt gives me that level of\ngranular control that I need, so\n\n28\n00:01:39.508 --> 00:01:43.337\nthat I can change the way these\npolicies are being applied.\n\n29\n00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:47.046\nAnd like I said,\nhave that level of granular control.\n\n30\n00:01:47.046 --> 00:01:47.546\n>> Very good.\n\n31\n00:01:47.546 --> 00:01:50.735\nSo if I was to apply a group\npolicy to an organizational unit,\n\n32\n00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:54.487\nif I understand it right, it's gonna\neffect everybody in that OU, but\n\n33\n00:01:54.487 --> 00:01:58.390\nthere might be a situation where\nmaybe that's just not feasible.\n\n34\n00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.382\nAnd Active Directory I believe will allow\nus a little bit more of that flexibility,\n\n35\n00:02:01.382 --> 00:02:03.879\nand you're gonna demonstrate some\nof that here for us, right Mike?\n\n36\n00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:04.629\n>> Absolutely.\n\n37\n00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:07.320\nWe'll take a look at\nhow we can set this up.\n\n38\n00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.020\nSo let's dive in here and\n\n39\n00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.550\nlet's start by just looking at why Group\nPolicy applies to everybody like that.\n\n40\n00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.796\nSo I'm gonna open up my\nGroup Policy Management console.\n\n41\n00:02:16.796 --> 00:02:19.170\nAnd in here,\nI haven't made any policies yet.\n\n42\n00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.838\nSo we'll just take a peek at\nmy Default Domain Policy.\n\n43\n00:02:21.838 --> 00:02:24.474\nAnd down here at the bottom\nof the Scope tab,\n\n44\n00:02:24.474 --> 00:02:27.046\nI can see the Security Filtering section.\n\n45\n00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:31.378\nAnd if we read that it says,\nthe settings in this GPO can only apply to\n\n46\n00:02:31.378 --> 00:02:34.504\nthe following groups,\nusers, and computers.\n\n47\n00:02:34.504 --> 00:02:37.280\nAnd the authenticated\nusers is listed there.\n\n48\n00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.671\nNow remember, authenticated users\nis everybody that's logged in.\n\n49\n00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:43.587\nThat's users as well as computers, right?\n\n50\n00:02:43.587 --> 00:02:45.030\nThey authenticate when\nthey first start up.\n\n51\n00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.999\nSo they are considered\nan authenticated user as well,\n\n52\n00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:52.462\nwhich means everybody\ncan apply group policy.\n\n53\n00:02:52.462 --> 00:02:53.629\nAnd let's take a look.\n\n54\n00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.484\nWhat we're gonna take advantage\nof is that every GPO has\n\n55\n00:02:57.484 --> 00:03:00.530\nan access control list associated with it.\n\n56\n00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.246\nJust like our resources on an NTFS\npartition, a file or a folder,\n\n57\n00:03:04.246 --> 00:03:08.776\nwe can pull up their properties and look\nat that security tab, and change who can\n\n58\n00:03:08.776 --> 00:03:12.921\nread or write or has full control by\nmodifying that access control list.\n\n59\n00:03:12.921 --> 00:03:15.338\nAnd that's exactly what\nwe're going to do here.\n\n60\n00:03:15.338 --> 00:03:20.493\nTo see the access control list for the\nGPO, I'm gonna go to delegation tab and\n\n61\n00:03:20.493 --> 00:03:23.837\nwe're going to click Advanced,\nand there it is.\n\n62\n00:03:23.837 --> 00:03:29.046\nThere is the access control list for\nthis individual GPO.\n\n63\n00:03:29.046 --> 00:03:33.504\nAnd if we take a look, the permissions are\nsimilar, but not quite the same as NTFS.\n\n64\n00:03:33.504 --> 00:03:36.586\nThe two we're really gonna\nfocus on are gonna be Read,\n\n65\n00:03:36.586 --> 00:03:39.199\nwhich gives you the ability\nto read the GPO, so\n\n66\n00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:43.296\nI can read what settings are in there,\nas well as the Apply Group Policy.\n\n67\n00:03:43.296 --> 00:03:47.346\nThis is what gives you the ability to\nactually apply those settings to your\n\n68\n00:03:47.346 --> 00:03:51.671\nuser, or if you're a computer, to apply\nthose settings to a registry there.\n\n69\n00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:54.901\nSo if I take a look at\nauthenticated users,\n\n70\n00:03:54.901 --> 00:04:00.129\nI'll see that they have read as\nwell apply group policy permission.\n\n71\n00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.886\nSo out of the box,\nby default any GPO you create,\n\n72\n00:04:03.886 --> 00:04:09.212\nthe authenticated users group is\ngiven read and apply group policy.\n\n73\n00:04:09.212 --> 00:04:12.462\nWhich means no matter where you link it,\neverybody is gonna be able to apply it.\n\n74\n00:04:12.462 --> 00:04:14.446\nSo if you link it to an OU,\n\n75\n00:04:14.446 --> 00:04:20.504\nthen everybody in that OU already has\npermission to read and apply that GPO.\n\n76\n00:04:20.504 --> 00:04:23.004\nThat's why all we have to do is link it,\nand we're good to go.\n\n77\n00:04:23.004 --> 00:04:27.223\nNext time the computer restarts,\nthe next time that user logs on, or\n\n78\n00:04:27.223 --> 00:04:31.954\na refresh cycle occurs, that policy\nshould apply, because everybody has,\n\n79\n00:04:31.954 --> 00:04:36.213\nor the authenticated users group,\nhas read and apply group policy.\n\n80\n00:04:36.213 --> 00:04:40.420\nBut now we want to tweak that behavior,\nwanna change it up a little bit.\n\n81\n00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.760\nWe don't want it to work that way,\nall right?\n\n82\n00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.480\nFor example in this scenario, what I\nwant to do is I want to map a drive, but\n\n83\n00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.700\nI only want it to apply to certain people,\n\n84\n00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.350\nonly certain people in my network\nneed access to this drive.\n\n85\n00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.664\nSo if I, and I'm going to use let's\nopen up Activity Directory and\n\n86\n00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.212\nsee who we can use here.\n\n87\n00:04:59.212 --> 00:05:04.643\nSo we go to tools, and then\nActivity Directory users and computers,\n\n88\n00:05:04.643 --> 00:05:10.448\nand in my employees OU, I've got Rob,\nwho is in my developer's OUNGNV,\n\n89\n00:05:10.448 --> 00:05:15.337\nand then I've got Bill in my\ndeveloper's OU in New York City.\n\n90\n00:05:15.337 --> 00:05:18.679\nAnd I wanna apply the policy\nto just those two people, but\n\n91\n00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:20.920\nI can't move their accounts around.\n\n92\n00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.213\nThere's no way to link it\nbecause they're in separate OUs.\n\n93\n00:05:24.213 --> 00:05:27.996\nAnd I can't move their accounts,\nbecause Rob's in the developer's OUNGNV,\n\n94\n00:05:27.996 --> 00:05:29.812\nwhich is where his account should be.\n\n95\n00:05:29.812 --> 00:05:33.895\nI've got other policies that are applied\nthere, I can't just go moving his account\n\n96\n00:05:33.895 --> 00:05:37.879\naround, that'll change all those other\npolicies or what policies apply to him.\n\n97\n00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:42.131\nAnother interesting fact about group\npolicies, I don't think we've mentioned\n\n98\n00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:45.780\nyet, is the fact that group policy\ndoesn't apply to groups, right?\n\n99\n00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.770\nIt's kind of funny that\nwe call it group policy.\n\n100\n00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.960\n>> That is a little twisted there,\nyeah, for sure.\n\n101\n00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.494\nSo we've got this policy,\nit's gonna be called group policy, but\n\n102\n00:05:53.494 --> 00:05:55.546\ndon't try to apply it to a group [LAUGH].\n\n103\n00:05:55.546 --> 00:05:59.590\n>> Yeah, we've already learned that\nI can only scope a GPO to the site,\n\n104\n00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.212\nto the domain, or to an OU.\n\n105\n00:06:01.212 --> 00:06:03.546\nIt has nothing to do with\nwhat groups you belong to.\n\n106\n00:06:03.546 --> 00:06:07.290\nWhen your computer starts up, it reaches\nout and talks to Active Director and\n\n107\n00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.167\nsays give me a list of policies\nthat I'm supposed to apply,\n\n108\n00:06:10.167 --> 00:06:13.682\nActive Directory looks for\nthat computer account in Active Directory,\n\n109\n00:06:13.682 --> 00:06:17.310\ndetermines what OU it's in, and\nit sees what policies have been linked and\n\n110\n00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.629\nwhat policies have been inherited down and\nsays here's your list.\n\n111\n00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:24.545\nIt doesn't concern itself for what groups\nthat computer might belong to, all right?\n\n112\n00:06:24.545 --> 00:06:25.962\nSame thing when you log on.\n\n113\n00:06:25.962 --> 00:06:28.655\nIt says, hey I'm logging on,\nI'm Mike Roderick,\n\n114\n00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:30.503\nwhat policy am I supposed to apply?\n\n115\n00:06:30.503 --> 00:06:34.213\nIt looks at my user account,\nwhere it is in Active Directory, and\n\n116\n00:06:34.213 --> 00:06:37.857\nit determines the list of policies\nthat I'm supposed to apply,\n\n117\n00:06:37.857 --> 00:06:41.170\nhas nothing to do with the groups\nthat I belong to, right?\n\n118\n00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.750\nThis is why where you put the groups in\nActive Directory really doesn't matter.\n\n119\n00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.200\nI create for myself,\nI created OU just for groups.\n\n120\n00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.962\nIt makes it easier for me to find.\n\n121\n00:06:50.962 --> 00:06:55.620\nSometimes I might subdivide that group so\nU, by location or by purpose of that group\n\n122\n00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.808\nor something like that, but I don't\nhave to try to put the GMV developer's\n\n123\n00:06:59.808 --> 00:07:04.421\ngroup in the GMV developer's OU,\nbecause it doesn't affect anything, right?\n\n124\n00:07:04.421 --> 00:07:07.020\nGroup policy does not apply to groups,\n\n125\n00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.280\nthough we can use groups when it\ncomes to an access control list.\n\n126\n00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.393\nSo we're gonna be able to take\nadvantage of using groups to do my\n\n127\n00:07:14.393 --> 00:07:15.690\nsecurity filtering.\n\n128\n00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.810\nSo even though group policy\ndoesn't apply to groups,\n\n129\n00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.140\nI can use groups to control who\nhas permissions over the GPO.\n\n130\n00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.480\nAnd in the end, that will determine\nwhether or not that policy applies to you.\n\n131\n00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.400\nSo a little bit twisty, kind of\na round about way to get there, but\n\n132\n00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.120\nwe can use groups to determine who\nthe policy actually applies to.\n\n133\n00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.921\nSo for this one, I'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate a new group.\n\n134\n00:07:39.921 --> 00:07:45.836\nAnd I'm gonna call this Mapped Data Drive.\n\n135\n00:07:45.836 --> 00:07:48.660\nAnd then I'm gonna add\na couple people to that group.\n\n136\n00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.129\nI'll add good old Rob's account.\n\n137\n00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:55.046\nAnd I'll throw Bill in there as well.\n\n138\n00:07:55.046 --> 00:07:59.369\nSo now I've got my two users that are in\ndifferent OU's in that group, and\n\n139\n00:07:59.369 --> 00:08:00.359\nI'll click OK.\n\n140\n00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.460\nThen we head back over to the group\npolicy management console.\n\n141\n00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.560\nAll right, and\nwe're gonna make a new policy.\n\n142\n00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.586\nGonna right-click and create that GPO, and\nI'm gonna link it to the domain itself.\n\n143\n00:08:12.586 --> 00:08:18.629\nI'm gonna call it Mapped Data Drive,\nand I'll click OK.\n\n144\n00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:21.655\nAnd then let's go ahead and\nedit that policy so\n\n145\n00:08:21.655 --> 00:08:23.836\nthat we can actually map a drive.\n\n146\n00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:24.626\nSo I'll go down to,\n\n147\n00:08:24.626 --> 00:08:27.004\nI'm gonna use Preferences cuz\nthey're pretty easy to use.\n\n148\n00:08:27.004 --> 00:08:31.602\nSo we get down to mapped drives,\nand I'll create a new mapped drive,\n\n149\n00:08:31.602 --> 00:08:35.329\nand we're gonna create it,\nand it's that dc01, and\n\n150\n00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:40.503\nI've already created the share,\nshared it out, slash, what did I call it?\n\n151\n00:08:40.503 --> 00:08:45.825\nData, and,\nwe'll pick a drive letter to map that to,\n\n152\n00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:50.129\nand I'll go ahead and click OK, all right?\n\n153\n00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:51.336\nAnd, then I'll close my editor.\n\n154\n00:08:51.336 --> 00:08:53.220\nSo Wes,\nat this point it's linked to the domain.\n\n155\n00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:53.920\nWho does it apply to?\n\n156\n00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.000\n>> Well, that's what I was thinking.\n\n157\n00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.480\nAt this point, you're gonna have everybody\n\n158\n00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.210\nin the domain's gonna\nhave that mapped drive.\n\n159\n00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:02.740\nAnd let's say it contains application\nsoftware that you need to download or\n\n160\n00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.870\nyou need to push out to your company, or\nmaybe marketing or development documents.\n\n161\n00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.440\nEverybody's gonna see that\ninformation at this point, right?\n\n162\n00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.340\n>> Absolutely.\nAnybody that,\n\n163\n00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.840\ncuz that's linked to the domain,\nit will inherit down to all of\n\n164\n00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.640\nthose OUs underneath there, and at this\npoint it should apply to everybody.\n\n165\n00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.960\nBut I don't want it to.\n\n166\n00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.507\nI've got some tools in there that\nmy developers need access to, and\n\n167\n00:09:21.507 --> 00:09:23.622\nI wanna make it easier for them to get to,\n\n168\n00:09:23.622 --> 00:09:26.130\nso I just Steve Rob and\nBill have access to this.\n\n169\n00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.717\nWell, how do we do that?\n\n170\n00:09:27.717 --> 00:09:32.065\nWe go Go to this Mapped Data Drive GPO,\nand we go to the Scope tab.\n\n171\n00:09:32.065 --> 00:09:34.255\nAnd down here underneath\nSecurity Filtering,\n\n172\n00:09:34.255 --> 00:09:38.965\nthe settings in this GPO can only apply to\nthe following groups, users and computers,\n\n173\n00:09:38.965 --> 00:09:42.645\nand the authenticated users is listed\nthere, again that's everybody.\n\n174\n00:09:42.645 --> 00:09:47.265\nWe're gonna remove\nthe authenticated users,\n\n175\n00:09:47.265 --> 00:09:51.645\nand then we're just gonna add\nthat Mapped Data Drive group.\n\n176\n00:09:51.645 --> 00:09:56.325\nAnd so now if we read this again,\nthe settings of this GPO can\n\n177\n00:09:56.325 --> 00:10:01.265\nonly apply to the following groups,\nusers, and computers, mapped data drive.\n\n178\n00:10:01.265 --> 00:10:04.945\nSo, even though it's linked to the domain\nand inheriting down to everything in\n\n179\n00:10:04.945 --> 00:10:10.075\nthere, if you're in this group, you have\npermissions to apply the group policy.\n\n180\n00:10:10.075 --> 00:10:12.895\nIf you're not in that group,\nyou don't have permissions, right?\n\n181\n00:10:12.895 --> 00:10:15.355\nIn effect, by removing\nthe authenticated users from here,\n\n182\n00:10:15.355 --> 00:10:18.035\nlet's go look at the actual\naccess control list.\n\n183\n00:10:19.135 --> 00:10:21.335\nYou'll see that the Authenticated Users\nis no longer listed here.\n\n184\n00:10:21.335 --> 00:10:23.765\nAnd by adding the map data drive,\nthey now have Read and\n\n185\n00:10:23.765 --> 00:10:25.755\nApply Group Policy permissions.\n\n186\n00:10:25.755 --> 00:10:30.035\nSo, even though it inherits down\nto everybody and everything,\n\n187\n00:10:30.035 --> 00:10:34.535\nonly if you're in that group do you\nhave permissions to apply that policy.\n\n188\n00:10:34.535 --> 00:10:37.995\nSo, let's go check it out and\nsee if it works.\n\n189\n00:10:37.995 --> 00:10:43.305\nI've got a client machine around here\nsomewhere, I'll make you guys dizzy.\n\n190\n00:10:43.305 --> 00:10:45.555\nAnd I'm gonna log in as Rob and\n\n191\n00:10:45.555 --> 00:10:50.955\nsince that was a user setting we learned\nthat those replied when the user logs on.\n\n192\n00:10:50.955 --> 00:10:53.275\nSo, I created a new policy.\n\n193\n00:10:53.275 --> 00:10:57.015\nUser's gonna log on and\nit should apply to Rob.\n\n194\n00:10:57.015 --> 00:11:01.385\nSo we'll log on here we'll\nflip over to our desktop and\n\n195\n00:11:01.385 --> 00:11:08.305\nwe'll open up file explorer and it's gonna\ntake it probably a second to show up here.\n\n196\n00:11:08.305 --> 00:11:12.025\nI want to give it a minute to catch up\nwith me, I went a little fast lets log\n\n197\n00:11:12.025 --> 00:11:15.775\noff, sometimes those map drives take one\nor two log on's to actually take effect so\n\n198\n00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:20.121\nI'm going to sign out and\nI'm going to log in as Rob again.\n\n199\n00:11:20.121 --> 00:11:24.195\nAll right, and\nthe other thing that needs to happen\n\n200\n00:11:27.725 --> 00:11:33.295\nis Rob needs to login to get\nhis new access token right\n\n201\n00:11:33.295 --> 00:11:36.255\nto include his group membership,\nthat he's now part of this group.\n\n202\n00:11:36.255 --> 00:11:39.295\nAnd that's the other\nthing that can happen.\n\n203\n00:11:39.295 --> 00:11:41.705\nWe can end up with some\ncash credentials on here,\n\n204\n00:11:41.705 --> 00:11:46.335\nbecause Windows wants to speed up that log\non process, so if his credentials are not\n\n205\n00:11:46.335 --> 00:11:50.595\nupdated with his new group membership,\nhe won't apply to that policy either.\n\n206\n00:11:50.595 --> 00:11:51.905\nSo, there it goes.\n\n207\n00:11:51.905 --> 00:11:55.085\nThere is my MAP drive.\n\n208\n00:11:55.085 --> 00:11:58.535\nSo, Rob logs on,\nRob has access to that data drive.\n\n209\n00:11:58.535 --> 00:12:05.745\nNow, let's log on with somebody\nthat's not in that group.\n\n210\n00:12:05.745 --> 00:12:06.245\nSo, I'll sign out.\n\n211\n00:12:06.245 --> 00:12:08.225\nAnd I'll go ahead and log on as,\nlet's do Ronnie here.\n\n212\n00:12:08.225 --> 00:12:16.695\nAnd we logged back in as Ronnie.\n\n213\n00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:20.015\nWe flip over to our desktop.\n\n214\n00:12:20.015 --> 00:12:21.945\nWe open up File Explorer and no map drive.\n\n215\n00:12:21.945 --> 00:12:25.035\nSo, now only Rob and\nBill have access or have a map.\n\n216\n00:12:25.035 --> 00:12:29.185\nAnd this doesn't control security,\ndon't think of it that way, right?\n\n217\n00:12:29.185 --> 00:12:31.255\nIf Ronnie knows the path,\nhe can definitely come up here and\n\n218\n00:12:31.255 --> 00:12:32.915\ntype in the UNC path and connect to it.\n\n219\n00:12:32.915 --> 00:12:37.345\nThis policy is just determining who\nhas it mapped in File Explorer.\n\n220\n00:12:37.345 --> 00:12:42.965\nI would control the permissions as well\nto control who actually can access that,\n\n221\n00:12:42.965 --> 00:12:43.655\nall right?\n\n222\n00:12:43.655 --> 00:12:48.325\nBut now I can control who gets that\nmapped drive by simply modifying group\n\n223\n00:12:48.325 --> 00:12:49.295\nMembership right?\n\n224\n00:12:49.295 --> 00:12:52.295\nWhat if I want Ronnie to\nhave access to that drive?\n\n225\n00:12:52.295 --> 00:12:54.645\nOr to have that map for it?\n\n226\n00:12:54.645 --> 00:12:57.025\nLet me log off as Ronnie.\n\n227\n00:12:57.025 --> 00:12:59.935\nAll I have to do, I have,\nI'd have to modify group policy.\n\n228\n00:12:59.935 --> 00:13:05.045\nAll I have to do is go here, open up\nthat group and add Ronnie to that group.\n\n229\n00:13:05.045 --> 00:13:13.395\nClick Ok, flip back over to that client.\n\n230\n00:13:13.395 --> 00:13:13.895\nLog in as Ronnie.\n\n231\n00:13:18.969 --> 00:13:22.325\nGo over to my desktop,\nopen up File Explorer.\n\n232\n00:13:23.435 --> 00:13:24.165\nAnd, again,\n\n233\n00:13:24.165 --> 00:13:28.185\nprobably have a little bit of cached\ncredentials going on, so let me log off.\n\n234\n00:13:28.185 --> 00:13:30.535\n>> Yeah, I've also seen too,\nif you were like, for instance,\n\n235\n00:13:30.535 --> 00:13:33.205\nmapping it the old way\nthrough log in scripts, for\n\n236\n00:13:33.205 --> 00:13:37.155\nsome reason it seems like it takes awhile\nto catch that script, map the drive.\n\n237\n00:13:37.155 --> 00:13:39.575\n>> You know, there's an interesting\n>> Same thing with Windows 8.1.\n\n238\n00:13:39.575 --> 00:13:42.725\nIf you're having trouble\ngetting scripts to run,\n\n239\n00:13:42.725 --> 00:13:48.195\nlike if you're doing log on scripts or\nstartup scripts, Windows 8.1 there's\n\n240\n00:13:48.195 --> 00:13:53.205\na default setting that says delay\nlog on scripts for five minutes.\n\n241\n00:13:53.205 --> 00:13:57.335\nSo, no matter what you do,\nno matter how much troubleshooting you do,\n\n242\n00:13:57.335 --> 00:14:00.255\nI have banged my head against the desk\nseveral times trying to figure\n\n243\n00:14:00.255 --> 00:14:01.435\nout what the heck is going wrong.\n\n244\n00:14:01.435 --> 00:14:04.195\nWhy is my script not working, and\n>> They were trying to speed up\n\n245\n00:14:04.195 --> 00:14:04.935\nthe logon process.\n\n246\n00:14:04.935 --> 00:14:08.695\nAnd there's a lot of contention going on\nduring the startup and the logon process,\n\n247\n00:14:08.695 --> 00:14:11.455\ndrivers starting, everything happening,\nyour profile loading up.\n\n248\n00:14:11.455 --> 00:14:13.245\nAnd so they said, you know what?\n\n249\n00:14:13.245 --> 00:14:16.825\nWe'll just bump the running of scripts\nback five minutes but didn't bother to\n\n250\n00:14:16.825 --> 00:14:20.815\nreally tell too many people so you've got\ncompanies that were trying to figure out\n\n251\n00:14:20.815 --> 00:14:24.325\nwhy when they upgraded to Windows 8.1, all\nof a sudden their scripts stopped working.\n\n252\n00:14:24.325 --> 00:14:26.625\nThey didn't stop, if you wait long enough,\n\n253\n00:14:26.625 --> 00:14:31.355\nthey will run, which But you have to wait\n5 minutes, you can go into that gpo and\n\n254\n00:14:31.355 --> 00:14:35.475\nyou can modify that you can set it to\n1 minute, you can set it to zero for\n\n255\n00:14:35.475 --> 00:14:38.985\nthat matter and\nhave them kick off automatically.\n\n256\n00:14:38.985 --> 00:14:41.335\nSo, if we go back in here\nthere's that map drive right?\n\n257\n00:14:41.335 --> 00:14:43.265\nSo, you can see now that\nI can control that.\n\n258\n00:14:43.265 --> 00:14:47.075\nI find this extremely useful when I'm\ndoing software deployment right, because\n\n259\n00:14:47.075 --> 00:14:52.575\nif I want to push out software with group\npolicy who do I want to push it out to?\n\n260\n00:14:52.575 --> 00:14:56.065\nTypically Different people from\ndifferent OUs so I can go ahead and\n\n261\n00:14:56.065 --> 00:14:59.365\ncreate a GPO that deploys the software and\nI can link it to the domain itself.\n\n262\n00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:01.695\nThen I remove the authenticated users and\n\n263\n00:15:01.695 --> 00:15:04.075\nlet's say I'm deploying word or\nnotepad plus plus.\n\n264\n00:15:04.075 --> 00:15:09.765\nI simply create a group called notepad\nplus plus and you do my security filtering\n\n265\n00:15:09.765 --> 00:15:15.925\nand I remove the authenticated users and\nI add a group called notepad plus plus.\n\n266\n00:15:15.925 --> 00:15:19.055\nSo, now only that group can apply Policy.\n\n267\n00:15:19.055 --> 00:15:21.345\nThen if Wes calls me up and\nsays hey, I need to use Notepad++,\n\n268\n00:15:21.345 --> 00:15:24.745\nI can just go into Active Directory and\nadd him to that group.\n\n269\n00:15:24.745 --> 00:15:26.935\nIf Titus calls me up the next day and\nsays hey, I need Notepad++,\n\n270\n00:15:26.935 --> 00:15:30.875\nI can just go into Active Directory and\nadd him to that group.\n\n271\n00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:33.695\nIt's simple to control\nwho gets the software\n\n272\n00:15:33.695 --> 00:15:36.735\nsimply by modifying\nthe membership of that group.\n\n273\n00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:40.185\nSo, that security filter one way\nI can do security filtering.\n\n274\n00:15:40.185 --> 00:15:46.495\nThis is when I want it to apply\nto only certain individuals.\n\n275\n00:15:46.495 --> 00:15:49.565\nBut there's another scenario Wes\nthat we've gotta be able to or\n\n276\n00:15:49.565 --> 00:15:51.865\nwe'd like to be able to do as well.\n\n277\n00:15:51.865 --> 00:15:55.915\nAnd that is I want it to apply to\neverybody except certain people.\n\n278\n00:15:55.915 --> 00:15:57.445\n>> No.\nWhen you say except certain people,\n\n279\n00:15:57.445 --> 00:16:00.385\none of the things that I think about in\nsecurity is why don't we just implement\n\n280\n00:16:00.385 --> 00:16:00.995\nan implicit deny.\n\n281\n00:16:00.995 --> 00:16:04.995\nIf you're not on the list,\nwell, it doesn't apply to you.\n\n282\n00:16:04.995 --> 00:16:05.745\n>> Wait.\nSay that again.\n\n283\n00:16:05.745 --> 00:16:06.945\nI think I missed the first part.\n\n284\n00:16:06.945 --> 00:16:09.725\n>> As far as implicit deny you wanna\n>> Apply to everybody except, well,\n\n285\n00:16:09.725 --> 00:16:11.135\njust don't put them on the list.\n\n286\n00:16:11.135 --> 00:16:13.645\nThey don't have the read and\nthe apply permission.\n\n287\n00:16:13.645 --> 00:16:14.445\n>> Right.\n>> Would that work?\n\n288\n00:16:14.445 --> 00:16:15.455\n>> It would.\nIt definitely would.\n\n289\n00:16:15.455 --> 00:16:18.145\nBut here's the problem you're\ngonna run into with that method.\n\n290\n00:16:18.145 --> 00:16:21.595\nIf I'm saying I only wanted to apply\nit certain people, as we just did,\n\n291\n00:16:21.595 --> 00:16:25.655\nit's easy just to remove the authenticated\nusers, create a group, and\n\n292\n00:16:25.655 --> 00:16:28.085\njust put the people I wanted\nto get it in that group.\n\n293\n00:16:29.205 --> 00:16:36.685\nBut to do it the other way, to have\nit apply to everybody certain people.\n\n294\n00:16:36.685 --> 00:16:37.525\nAll right.\n\n295\n00:16:37.525 --> 00:16:38.425\nWell, now I've got a.\n\n296\n00:16:38.425 --> 00:16:41.495\nIf I was gonna do that\nimplicit deny that way.\n\n297\n00:16:41.495 --> 00:16:44.345\nWhat I would have to do\nwas create a group that\n\n298\n00:16:44.345 --> 00:16:47.865\nsomehow concluded everybody\nexcept those few people.\n\n299\n00:16:47.865 --> 00:16:50.745\nRight.\nAnd everybody's gonna change as we hire\n\n300\n00:16:50.745 --> 00:16:54.165\nnew people, and\nnow I've gotta put them in that group.\n\n301\n00:16:54.165 --> 00:16:56.755\nRight.\nCuz the group is gonna contain\n\n302\n00:16:56.755 --> 00:16:58.315\neverybody except Wes and Tydis.\n\n303\n00:16:58.315 --> 00:16:59.565\n>> All right.\n\n304\n00:16:59.565 --> 00:17:02.325\nBut as my company grows,\nI now have to change that group.\n\n305\n00:17:02.325 --> 00:17:04.575\nI have to remember to put them in there.\n\n306\n00:17:04.575 --> 00:17:07.135\nSo, it becomes a lot more\nadministrative overload.\n\n307\n00:17:07.135 --> 00:17:11.695\n>> I was going to say it sounds like it\nincreases the administrative complexity\n\n308\n00:17:11.695 --> 00:17:12.565\nbehind doing that.\n\n309\n00:17:12.565 --> 00:17:15.095\nSo, you could do it, but\nmaybe not the easiest way to do that.\n\n310\n00:17:15.095 --> 00:17:19.265\n>> Definitely not because I've got to\nkeep that group up to date with who is,\n\n311\n00:17:19.265 --> 00:17:23.305\nwho is everybody except Titus and\nWes, right?\n\n312\n00:17:23.305 --> 00:17:27.025\nThat changes as we hire new people,\nas we fire new people,\n\n313\n00:17:27.025 --> 00:17:29.475\nthat everybody except West and\nTitus changes.\n\n314\n00:17:29.475 --> 00:17:31.475\nSo, there's actually a better\nway we can do this, and\n\n315\n00:17:31.475 --> 00:17:33.125\nthat's what I'm gonna show you next.\n\n316\n00:17:33.125 --> 00:17:35.065\nIt's gonna be done very similar.\n\n317\n00:17:35.065 --> 00:17:38.065\nWhat I'm gonna do in my demo\n\n318\n00:17:38.065 --> 00:17:41.845\nhere is I'm gonna prevent everybody\nfrom accessing my red headed tools.\n\n319\n00:17:41.845 --> 00:17:45.125\nI don't want anybody in the domain to\nbe able to modify the registry, right?\n\n320\n00:17:45.125 --> 00:17:51.505\nBut I've got certain people that they\nneed to be able to edit the register.\n\n321\n00:17:51.505 --> 00:17:55.115\nSo, let's see how we\ncan be able to do that.\n\n322\n00:17:55.115 --> 00:17:58.355\nI am going to create a group and\n\n323\n00:17:58.355 --> 00:18:03.860\nI'm going to call it allow [INAUDIBLE].\n\n324\n00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:04.725\nAll right.\n\n325\n00:18:04.725 --> 00:18:06.775\nAnd I'm a little OCD so I gotta fix that.\n\n326\n00:18:06.775 --> 00:18:09.265\nAllow [INAUDIBLE] and I click OK.\n\n327\n00:18:09.265 --> 00:18:16.375\nAnd in here I'm going to add let's do\nthe same two people because I know their\n\n328\n00:18:16.375 --> 00:18:20.165\nprofiles are built already, so we don't\nhave to wait for them when we log on.\n\n329\n00:18:20.165 --> 00:18:22.225\nLet's do Rob and Bill.\n\n330\n00:18:22.225 --> 00:18:26.405\nWe'll go ahead and add those guys there.\n\n331\n00:18:26.405 --> 00:18:33.965\nSo, now I've got a group that contains\nthe people did I do this right?\n\n332\n00:18:33.965 --> 00:18:36.015\nWe're creating a group, yes, okay.\n\n333\n00:18:36.015 --> 00:18:37.535\nHold on a second.\n\n334\n00:18:37.535 --> 00:18:39.967\nI think, Wes, I got twisted around there.\n\n335\n00:18:39.967 --> 00:18:41.635\nIn this case, I want to.\n\n336\n00:18:41.635 --> 00:18:44.626\nNo, we want to deny except for\nthese people.\n\n337\n00:18:44.626 --> 00:18:51.127\nSo I click okay On that group and we'll\nflip back over to group policy management.\n\n338\n00:18:51.127 --> 00:18:56.124\nAnd now I'm going to create\na GPO up here at the domain,\n\n339\n00:18:56.124 --> 00:18:59.613\nand I'm gonna call it Block Regedit.\n\n340\n00:19:01.838 --> 00:19:03.070\nAnd we'll click OK.\n\n341\n00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:06.340\nAnd then we need to\nactually block Regedit, so\n\n342\n00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.840\nI'll go in here and we'll choose edit.\n\n343\n00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:13.905\nAnd then we're gonna go\nunderneath my user configuration,\n\n344\n00:19:13.905 --> 00:19:18.184\npolicies, administrative templates,\nsystem.\n\n345\n00:19:18.184 --> 00:19:22.521\nAnd in here I've got prevent access\nto registry editing tools, so\n\n346\n00:19:22.521 --> 00:19:24.855\nI'm gonna double-click on that.\n\n347\n00:19:24.855 --> 00:19:29.318\nAnd I'm gonna enable it and I'm also\ngonna prevent it from running silently.\n\n348\n00:19:29.318 --> 00:19:34.541\nAnd we'll click OK on that setting,\nand we'll close my editor.\n\n349\n00:19:34.541 --> 00:19:41.241\nSo now I've got a policy that is linked\nto the domain that blocks regedit, right?\n\n350\n00:19:41.241 --> 00:19:44.953\nAnd according to the security filtering,\nit applies to everybody,\n\n351\n00:19:44.953 --> 00:19:47.260\nthe authenticated users is listed there.\n\n352\n00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:52.030\nBut I don't want it to apply to that\ngroup that contains Rob and Bill.\n\n353\n00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:53.600\nWell, how do I do that?\n\n354\n00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.270\nRemember, previously, we just\nremoved the authenticated users and\n\n355\n00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.650\nadded the group that we wanted\nthis policy to apply to but\n\n356\n00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:02.630\nthis time we're doing Doing it different,\nright?\n\n357\n00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:06.459\nI want it to apply to everybody\nexcept certain people, right?\n\n358\n00:20:06.459 --> 00:20:08.044\nAnd I can't do that here.\n\n359\n00:20:08.044 --> 00:20:12.670\nThis security filtering only\ndetermines who it does apply to.\n\n360\n00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.772\nIt doesn't say anything about\nwho it doesn't apply to, right?\n\n361\n00:20:15.772 --> 00:20:20.618\nSo I have to leave the authenticated\nusers here because I want everybody\n\n362\n00:20:20.618 --> 00:20:22.972\nto be blocked from doing regedit.\n\n363\n00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:25.510\nWhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\nflip over to delegation tab.\n\n364\n00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.440\nAnd I'm gonna open up\nmy access control list.\n\n365\n00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.750\nAnd again,\nleaving the authenticated users,\n\n366\n00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.270\nI wanna block this reg\nedit from everybody.\n\n367\n00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:38.520\nBut then I'm gonna click,\nadd a1nd I'm gonna find that group,\n\n368\n00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.710\nwe called it block regedit.\n\n369\n00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:43.640\nI thought I did.\n\n370\n00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.580\nWhat did I call it?\n\n371\n00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:51.390\nYou know, if I had a memory allow regedit.\n\n372\n00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:53.354\nI'm not trying to block it,\nI'm blocking it from everybody.\n\n373\n00:20:53.354 --> 00:20:59.979\nSo we're gonna call that allow regedit,\nand we're gonna grab that group.\n\n374\n00:20:59.979 --> 00:21:03.071\nAnd once they're in\nthe access control list,\n\n375\n00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:07.840\nI'm simply gonna choose to deny\nthe applied group policy permission.\n\n376\n00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.785\nI could deny read as well,\nit really wouldn't matter.\n\n377\n00:21:10.785 --> 00:21:14.955\nIf you don't have the applied group policy\npermission you're not going to be able to\n\n378\n00:21:14.955 --> 00:21:15.492\napply it.\n\n379\n00:21:15.492 --> 00:21:20.291\nThen I'll click OK, and it's gonna warn\nme that denies are bad and I say okay,\n\n380\n00:21:20.291 --> 00:21:21.630\nI understand that.\n\n381\n00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.820\nAnd what we'll notice is it\ndoesn't tell me what I did.\n\n382\n00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.810\nWhen you look at this delegation,\nthere is my group and it just says custom.\n\n383\n00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.680\nSo if another admin comes along and wants\nto know what you did, you're gonna have\n\n384\n00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.560\ncome what's going on up here, they're\ngonna have to click the advance button and\n\n385\n00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.880\nfind that group to try to\nsee what is happening there.\n\n386\n00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.480\nBut now if we If you think about it.\n\n387\n00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.890\nI go back out here.\n\n388\n00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:48.240\nThis policy applies to everybody,\nbut if you're in that group,\n\n389\n00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.625\nyou're gonna be denied the applied\ngroup policy permission.\n\n390\n00:21:51.625 --> 00:21:55.814\nBut wait a second, you're also in\nthe authenticated users group, right?\n\n391\n00:21:55.814 --> 00:21:59.955\nI mean everybody's in there, but\nremember the way those denies work.\n\n392\n00:21:59.955 --> 00:22:05.605\nDenies override the allows so even though\nRob, in this case, is in the authenticated\n\n393\n00:22:05.605 --> 00:22:10.086\nUser group and is getting apply\ngroup policy permission from that.\n\n394\n00:22:10.086 --> 00:22:12.905\nHe is also in the allow\nregetic group which is\n\n395\n00:22:12.905 --> 00:22:17.185\ndenying him permission to read\nthis policy and apply this policy.\n\n396\n00:22:17.185 --> 00:22:21.106\nThe deny is gonna override the allow,\nRob this policy won't apply to Rob,\n\n397\n00:22:21.106 --> 00:22:24.300\nit won't apply to Bill,\nit will apply to everybody else.\n\n398\n00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.450\n>> And hence the warning there when they\nsay you gotta be careful with those denies\n\n399\n00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.230\ncause it doesn't matter\nthe groups that you're in.\n\n400\n00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:32.519\nI mean it's gonna trump everything and\nyou might either give somebody.\n\n401\n00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:36.985\nWell, most likely you'll cut their access\noff and that might not be what you're\n\n402\n00:22:36.985 --> 00:22:40.895\ntrying to accomplish, but\nin this situation, you set it up that way.\n\n403\n00:22:40.895 --> 00:22:42.108\n>> Yup, exactly.\n\n404\n00:22:42.108 --> 00:22:46.088\nSo, let's log on as Ronnie and\n\n405\n00:22:46.088 --> 00:22:51.611\nwe'll type in his super secret password.\n\n406\n00:22:51.611 --> 00:22:57.000\nAnd we'll flip over to the desktop here,\nand we will try to run Regedit.\n\n407\n00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.980\nAnd it says this setting\nhas been enabled or\n\n408\n00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:05.800\nregistry editing has been\ndisabled by your administrator.\n\n409\n00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.770\nSo my policy that I linked at\nthe domain is inheriting down and\n\n410\n00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.160\napplying to everybody, right?\n\n411\n00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.040\nBut let's see what happens\nwhen we log on as Rob.\n\n412\n00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:19.230\nAnd Rob is in that group\nthat I called AllowRegedit.\n\n413\n00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:26.626\nAnd I've denied that group the ability\nto read or apply this particular policy.\n\n414\n00:23:26.626 --> 00:23:30.497\nWe'll log in as Rob,\n\n415\n00:23:30.497 --> 00:23:34.375\nclick on My Desktop.\n\n416\n00:23:34.375 --> 00:23:38.800\nGo to my run dialog box and,\nsure enough, they can launch regedit.\n\n417\n00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.600\nSo two different ways they can\ndo that security filtering.\n\n418\n00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.570\nIf I want it to apply to\neverybody except certain\n\n419\n00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:53.560\npeople that I leave the authenticated\nusers group and I create a group that\n\n420\n00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:58.000\ncontains those certain people and I deny\nthem the ability to apply group policy.\n\n421\n00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.520\nIf I only wanted to apply to certain\npeople, I just remove the authenticated\n\n422\n00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.670\nusers group from that scope tab,\nthe security filtering, and\n\n423\n00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:08.810\nI add the group that I want the policy to\napply to right there on that scope tab.\n\n424\n00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:13.040\nSo two different ways that we can\nget that granular control over\n\n425\n00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.660\nthe application of group policy.\n\n426\n00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:21.430\nBut that's not all, there is another way\nwe can have a little bit more control\n\n427\n00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:27.270\nover who this policy applies to and\nthat is something know as WMI filtering.\n\n428\n00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.798\n>> Now the WMI filtering there,\n\n429\n00:24:28.798 --> 00:24:32.164\nthat sounds like an administrative\ncomplexity in it of itself and\n\n430\n00:24:32.164 --> 00:24:35.978\nI believe that acronym stands for\nWindows Management Instrumentation.\n\n431\n00:24:35.978 --> 00:24:39.096\nHelp us out with that one Mike,\nbecause I hear that one can be very,\n\n432\n00:24:39.096 --> 00:24:40.996\nvery confusing when it comes down to it.\n\n433\n00:24:40.996 --> 00:24:45.223\n>> All of the above Wes, they can be\nreally confusing because it's another\n\n434\n00:24:45.223 --> 00:24:49.464\nlanguage that we have to learn but\nreally cool too once you've learn it.\n\n435\n00:24:49.464 --> 00:24:53.868\nSo, WMI is\nWindows Management Instrumentation and\n\n436\n00:24:53.868 --> 00:24:59.278\nit uses a language called WQL,\nwhich is the WMI Query Language.\n\n437\n00:24:59.278 --> 00:25:05.246\nIf you've ever done any work with SQL or\nTransact-SQL, you'll see the similarities.\n\n438\n00:25:05.246 --> 00:25:09.066\nIt is very similar to that, except for\nthe classes that we have to work with.\n\n439\n00:25:09.066 --> 00:25:14.510\nAnd we're not gonna dive into all the\ndifferent classes that are available and\n\n440\n00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:15.840\nthings like that.\n\n441\n00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.889\nThat's for another show.\n\n442\n00:25:17.889 --> 00:25:21.489\nI just wanna show you how to\ncreate a simple WMI filter and\n\n443\n00:25:21.489 --> 00:25:23.720\nhow I can use it with group policy.\n\n444\n00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.357\nWe saw some security filtering where we\nused group membership to do the filtering.\n\n445\n00:25:28.357 --> 00:25:33.187\nEither by removing the authenticated users\nand then adding that group in there, or\n\n446\n00:25:33.187 --> 00:25:36.568\nby going to the access control itself and\nadding a group and\n\n447\n00:25:36.568 --> 00:25:39.682\nthen denying the ability\nto apply that group policy.\n\n448\n00:25:39.682 --> 00:25:41.601\nSo, we've seen that.\n\n449\n00:25:41.601 --> 00:25:44.579\nRemember, computers can be\nmembers of groups as well.\n\n450\n00:25:44.579 --> 00:25:47.267\nSo, if I wanna use computers to do\nthat type of security filtering,\n\n451\n00:25:47.267 --> 00:25:48.270\nI definitely can.\n\n452\n00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:52.010\nI just add those computer groups to that,\nor those computer accounts to that group,\n\n453\n00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:57.860\nand then do the same thing I did\nearlier with the user accounts.\n\n454\n00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:01.060\nJust add the group to\nthe access control list, and\n\n455\n00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.050\ndeny the applied group policy permission.\n\n456\n00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:07.900\nWhere WMI shines is the ability to get\naccess to information about the system,\n\n457\n00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:13.010\nlike how much RAM the system has or how\nmuch free hard drive space or what version\n\n458\n00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:17.200\nof the operating system, what service pack\nlevel, what applications are installed.\n\n459\n00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.830\nI mean there's tons of possibilities.\n\n460\n00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:22.220\nLet's say I'm trying to push out Office.\n\n461\n00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:25.800\nI know that Office requires so\nmuch free disc space, all right.\n\n462\n00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.510\nWell, if I go and push that out to all\nthe computers in the sales department,\n\n463\n00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:32.650\nwhat if some Some of those computers don't\nhave enough of that free disk space.\n\n464\n00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:34.840\nThat installation is going to start and\ncrash.\n\n465\n00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.420\nAnd it's going to eat up\nthe rest of their disc space and\n\n466\n00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:40.420\nOffice isn't going to be installed and\nit's going to just be a big mess.\n\n467\n00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.840\nWhat if there's a way I can check\nto see if they have free disc space\n\n468\n00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.530\nbefore I applied that policy?\n\n469\n00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:48.600\nAnd if they don't just don't\napply it to that machine.\n\n470\n00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.590\nThat's what Windows Management\nInstrumentation gives me the ability to\n\n471\n00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:54.150\ndo or these wmi filters that.\n\n472\n00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.660\nThat I can create in group policy.\n\n473\n00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.280\nSo, let's take a look at\ncreating one in here.\n\n474\n00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.630\nI'm gonna do a simple one.\n\n475\n00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.960\nI'm gonna create a shortcut on the desktop\nbecause that's a easy thing to verify.\n\n476\n00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:07.500\nSo, I'm gonna start by creating my policy.\n\n477\n00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:13.490\nI'll create a GPO in this domain,\nand I'll call it Notepad.\n\n478\n00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:19.190\nGood golly, Notepad Shortcut,\nand I'll click OK.\n\n479\n00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.674\nAnd then I'll edit that policy.\n\n480\n00:27:23.576 --> 00:27:30.310\nAnd we'll go down into Preferences, and\nthen Window Settings, and then Shortcuts.\n\n481\n00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:32.440\nAnd we'll create a new Shortcut.\n\n482\n00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.880\nSo, I'm gonna create a Shortcut,\nI'm gonna call it Notepad.\n\n483\n00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.570\nAnd I'll want to dump it out on the\nDesktop, cuz that'll be easy to verify.\n\n484\n00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:44.960\nAnd the target path for\nthe Notepad executable is what C\n\n485\n00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.270\nbackslash windows, backslash system 32,\nbackslash notepad.exe.\n\n486\n00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.540\nAnd I go ahead and click okay.\n\n487\n00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:54.300\nNow, I've got a policy,\nand I'll close the editor.\n\n488\n00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.650\nI've got a policy linked to the domain\n\n489\n00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:03.450\nthat's going to create a shortcut for\nnotepad.\n\n490\n00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:07.310\nNext, I'm going to create my WMI film.\n\n491\n00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:09.600\nAnd these guys are separate\nfrom The GPO's.\n\n492\n00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.340\nThey're a separate object,\nwhich means they're portable if you will.\n\n493\n00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.610\nI can use the same filter\nwith more than one GPO.\n\n494\n00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:19.790\nSo, I'm gonna right click and\nchoose new filter.\n\n495\n00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:24.722\nAnd I'll give it a name, Notepad shortcut.\n\n496\n00:28:27.776 --> 00:28:30.205\nAnd then for my query, I'll click add and\n\n497\n00:28:30.205 --> 00:28:33.058\nthis is where I actually\nhave to write the query.\n\n498\n00:28:33.058 --> 00:28:40.147\nI want to select Select\nall from what's called\n\n499\n00:28:40.147 --> 00:28:45.450\nthe Win32_operatingsystem.\n\n500\n00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:46.653\nMake sure I spell that right.\n\n501\n00:28:46.653 --> 00:28:51.021\nWin32_operatingsystem and\n\n502\n00:28:51.021 --> 00:28:57.350\nI wanna say where product type is\nequal to and then I'm gonna put a one.\n\n503\n00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.250\nRight.\nAgain,\n\n504\n00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:01.210\nwe're not gonna Dive into the different\nclasses that are available.\n\n505\n00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:03.810\nBut, just so you know what I'm doing,\n\n506\n00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:07.320\nproduct type deals with whether\nit's a client or server.\n\n507\n00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.960\nProduct type one is my desktop OS's.\n\n508\n00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.010\nProduct type two are my domain controller,\nso\n\n509\n00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:17.560\nserver operating system with\nactive directory installed.\n\n510\n00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:20.030\nProduct type three are my\nnon-domain controllers,\n\n511\n00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:23.230\nserver operating system but\nno active directory.\n\n512\n00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.480\nSo, in this case I want to Create one.\n\n513\n00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.040\nAnd that only happens on\nclient operating systems.\n\n514\n00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:28.840\nAnd I'll click OK.\n\n515\n00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:32.760\nAnd it's gonna warn you that\nthe name space might not be valid.\n\n516\n00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.860\nI know it is, so I can go ahead and\nclick OK on that.\n\n517\n00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.000\nAnd now I've got my query,\nand I'll click save.\n\n518\n00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:41.850\nAll right.\n\n519\n00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:45.940\nBut notice the query is down here,\nseparate from all my GPO's.\n\n520\n00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:51.930\nSo, what we do, is we go the GPO, and\nAnd we choose to add a WMI filter to it.\n\n521\n00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:53.270\nI hit this drop down list,\n\n522\n00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:58.010\nand it will show me all of the WMI\nfilters that I have created.\n\n523\n00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:00.410\nAnd I'll add that WMI filter,\nand I'll click yes.\n\n524\n00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:03.490\nAnd again,\nwhen I was talking about the portability,\n\n525\n00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:06.540\nI could use that same filter\non a different GPO if I want.\n\n526\n00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.170\n>> Now that's interesting Mike, once you\ngot done putting in that language there,\n\n527\n00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:14.150\nthe moment you clicked apply,\nit knew exactly what you were talking\n\n528\n00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:16.920\n>> About and it populated in that\n\n529\n00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:20.890\ndrop down list the right WI, MI filter\nthat you just said, that's pretty neat.\n\n530\n00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:21.850\n>> It is, fantastic.\n\n531\n00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:23.530\nAll right so now lets test this out.\n\n532\n00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.140\nI'm gonna go over to my\nclient operating system, and\n\n533\n00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.114\nI'm gonna log in as the administrator.\n\n534\n00:30:33.639 --> 00:30:37.796\nWe'll log in,\nthis is a client operating system.\n\n535\n00:30:37.796 --> 00:30:42.090\nSo, if I flip over to my desktop stop,\nsure enough there's my shortcut for\n\n536\n00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:42.790\nnotepad.\n\n537\n00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:46.330\nWhat if I log onto a server?\n\n538\n00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:49.000\nIf I login here as the administrator.\n\n539\n00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.600\nWait for it.\nDrumroll please.\n\n540\n00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.100\nAnd I can already see it.\n\n541\n00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:00.010\nBut I'll minimize server\n\n542\n00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:04.460\nmanager just to make sure I'm not\nhiding it behind manager there.\n\n543\n00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:05.660\nNo short cut for Notepad.\n\n544\n00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:09.500\nSo, that's what WMI filters can do for\nme, they give me the ability\n\n545\n00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.930\nto look at the system and determine\nwhether or not this policy should apply.\n\n546\n00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:19.580\nAnd you can do lots of cool things like\nI said, operating system conversion.\n\n547\n00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.650\nI don't want this to apply\nto Windows XP or prior.\n\n548\n00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:25.090\nOr I only want it to apply to Windows 8.1.\n\n549\n00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:29.090\nOr I only want it to apply to Windows\n7 if they get service pack one.\n\n550\n00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:31.570\nBecause of really cool things\nwith those WMI filters.\n\n551\n00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.100\n>> Yeah, that's very good.\n\n552\n00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.340\nGood information there.\n\n553\n00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:38.550\nSo, we've been looking at how to filter\ngroup policy in this episode, talking\n\n554\n00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:41.840\nabout if you want to apply a certain\nsetting but you don't want it to apply\n\n555\n00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:45.540\nto everybody in the domain or everybody\nin OU, you can get really specific.\n\n556\n00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.870\nAnd even more so,\nattributes based on the computer as well.\n\n557\n00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:52.144\nSo, Mike all great information and\nI really appreciate it.\n\n558\n00:31:52.144 --> 00:31:54.150\nYou got anything else for us on this one?\n\n559\n00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:55.920\nNo, I think that about wraps it up.\n\n560\n00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:59.170\nAgain, just try to decide\nwhat you are trying to do,\n\n561\n00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:00.900\nwhy are you trying to filter that policy?\n\n562\n00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.340\nIs it supposed to everybody but\ncertain people?\n\n563\n00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.300\nIs it supposed to apply\nto only certain people or\n\n564\n00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.870\ndo I want to base it on a property\nof the computer itself?\n\n565\n00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:13.050\nThat will determine which way you\ngo about filtering the policies.\n\n566\n00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:13.880\n>> All right, great.\n\n567\n00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.520\nAnd it looks like we're coming\nto the end of this episode, but\n\n568\n00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.210\nwe've got more Working with Group Policy.\n\n569\n00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:22.540\nSo, signing of for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n570\n00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.820\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n571\n00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:24.805\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n572\n00:32:24.805 --> 00:32:29.924\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "description": "With all the configurations that you can do with Group Policy Objects whether it be configuring, edit, apply or link to a GPOs we need a way to determine what settings are applying. In this episode Mike and Wes demonstrate how to determine settings through a concept Resultant Set of Policy(RSoP). They look at the utilities to determine RSoP like GPResults in Windows Command Prompt or the Group Policy Results Wizard in Windows Server 2012 R2. They talk about how to determine the \"what if\" scenarios for GPO application before implementing those settings in a production environment through the Group Policy Modeling Wizard.",

00:00:16.133\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:20.371\nAnd today's episode we're gonna be\nmoving on in working with group policy.\n\n5\n00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:23.075\nAnd we've talked a lot about\nsome of the different settings,\n\n6\n00:00:23.075 --> 00:00:25.369\nsome of the things you can\nsee inside a group policy.\n\n7\n00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.664\nWe talked about things\nlike processing order and\n\n8\n00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:30.692\nsometimes those settings don't\nalways pan out the way we want.\n\n9\n00:00:30.692 --> 00:00:34.620\nWell, we've got a technology that we're\ngonna at today called the result instead\n\n10\n00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.190\nof policy.\n\n11\n00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.701\nAnd we've got none other than Mr. Mike\nRodrick here to help us sort this out.\n\n12\n00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:39.821\nMike, how you doing today sir?\n\n13\n00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:41.010\n>> I'm doing good, Wes.\n\n14\n00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.101\nThanks for having me here.\n\n15\n00:00:42.101 --> 00:00:44.150\nIt can get very confusing, right?\n\n16\n00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.390\nWe get into a larger\nenterprise environment.\n\n17\n00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.340\nWe're talking about dozens\nof dozens of policies\n\n18\n00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.940\nthat we can be applying\nin Active Directory.\n\n19\n00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.803\nAnd in each one of those policies we\nmight be doing security filtering, or\n\n20\n00:00:55.803 --> 00:00:56.689\nWMI filtering.\n\n21\n00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:00.568\nSo trying to figure out what\nsettings are actually being\n\n22\n00:01:00.568 --> 00:01:02.804\napplied when that user logs on.\n\n23\n00:01:02.804 --> 00:01:03.922\nWhen that computer starts up.\n\n24\n00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:07.173\nWhen that user logs on,\nthat can be challenging, right?\n\n25\n00:01:07.173 --> 00:01:08.769\nBut luckily for us, as Wes said,\n\n26\n00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:12.040\nMicrosoft gives us some tools\nthat we can use to look at that.\n\n27\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.680\nNow, remember,\nwe've defined that term already.\n\n28\n00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.030\nWe'll mention it again.\n\n29\n00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.398\nWhat we're really talking\nabout is known as the RSOP, or\n\n30\n00:01:19.398 --> 00:01:21.673\nthe Resultant Set of Policy.\n\n31\n00:01:21.673 --> 00:01:24.484\nAnd what that means is that\nresults instead of policy is,\n\n32\n00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:26.427\ntake everything into consideration.\n\n33\n00:01:26.427 --> 00:01:29.929\nAll the inheritance,\nall the blocking inheritance,\n\n34\n00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:35.320\nall the enforcement on the links, the\nsecurity filtering, the w my filtering.\n\n35\n00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.465\nAll of that, in the end,\nwhat setting are actually being applied?\n\n36\n00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:41.650\nCuz remember as each layer of policy\ngets applied one on top of the other.\n\n37\n00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.530\nFirst local, than site, than domain,\nthan OU, and we can have multiple.\n\n38\n00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.443\nPolicy's linked at each location.\n\n39\n00:01:47.443 --> 00:01:51.597\nAnd there might be a dozen policies linked\nat the domain that are inheriting down\n\n40\n00:01:51.597 --> 00:01:52.218\nto that OU.\n\n41\n00:01:52.218 --> 00:01:55.658\nThe OU itself might have\nseveral policies linked to it.\n\n42\n00:01:55.658 --> 00:01:58.983\nAnd that precedence determines\nwhich one gets applied first.\n\n43\n00:01:58.983 --> 00:02:02.352\nAnd it's the last one that applies wins,\nright, or\n\n44\n00:02:02.352 --> 00:02:06.576\nthe later policies have a chance\nto override previous policies.\n\n45\n00:02:06.576 --> 00:02:10.341\nSo, we've gotta try to figure\nout what that end result is.\n\n46\n00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:11.817\nDo we have it set up properly?\n\n47\n00:02:11.817 --> 00:02:14.817\nAre the settings making it down,\nare their userlogs on?\n\n48\n00:02:14.817 --> 00:02:17.579\nAnd they don't have that\nshortcut on their desktop, or\n\n49\n00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.653\nthey don't have that map network drive.\n\n50\n00:02:19.653 --> 00:02:20.506\nWhy?\n\n51\n00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:21.644\nWhere's the problem?\n\n52\n00:02:21.644 --> 00:02:24.224\nWhat policy is conflicting\nwith another policy?\n\n53\n00:02:24.224 --> 00:02:25.795\nWhy is that setting not there?\n\n54\n00:02:25.795 --> 00:02:30.136\nAre they not in the right group,\nis the WMI filter preventing something?\n\n55\n00:02:30.136 --> 00:02:34.403\nSo that's what we need to be able to do,\nis determine what that RSOP is.\n\n56\n00:02:34.403 --> 00:02:38.163\nSo we can start our troubleshooting,\nfigure out where the problem might lay and\n\n57\n00:02:38.163 --> 00:02:40.193\nthen hopefully be able to fix the problem.\n\n58\n00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:43.307\nSo as I said,\nseveral different tools we can use and\n\n59\n00:02:43.307 --> 00:02:46.428\nWes one of the oldest ones\nis the good old GP result.\n\n60\n00:02:46.428 --> 00:02:47.586\n>> All right, very good.\n\n61\n00:02:47.586 --> 00:02:49.943\nBack to the command line again.\n\n62\n00:02:49.943 --> 00:02:53.260\nI've seen this one once or twice before\nand I know that it does help out a lot.\n\n63\n00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.063\nMike, you're gonna hopefully show\nus what that's all about here.\n\n64\n00:02:56.063 --> 00:02:57.104\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n65\n00:02:57.104 --> 00:02:58.517\nLet's take a look at it.\n\n66\n00:02:58.517 --> 00:03:01.967\nIf you've been watching our episodes you\nknow we've got a few policies lined up at\n\n67\n00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:02.519\nthis point.\n\n68\n00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.709\nWe've been leaking them here and\nthere and doing some security filtering.\n\n69\n00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.919\nIf I want to troubleshoot,\nif a user calls me up says.\n\n70\n00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.053\nHow come I don't have this\nshortcut on my desktop?\n\n71\n00:03:11.053 --> 00:03:14.885\nI'm in the developers OU or\nI'm in the developers department.\n\n72\n00:03:14.885 --> 00:03:19.518\nWhy don't I have,\nwhy am I not allowed to do reg editor?\n\n73\n00:03:19.518 --> 00:03:21.922\nOr why don't I have that\nshortcut on my desktop?\n\n74\n00:03:21.922 --> 00:03:25.670\nWell one of the first things I'm gonna\ndo is I'm gonna use GP resolute.\n\n75\n00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.963\nWhich as Wes said,\nit's just a simple command line interface.\n\n76\n00:03:28.963 --> 00:03:31.360\nSo I'm gonna pop open\na command prompt here.\n\n77\n00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.266\nAnd GP result is the name of the command.\n\n78\n00:03:34.266 --> 00:03:38.398\nSo GP result and if I do a switch\nquestion mark we'll see that\n\n79\n00:03:38.398 --> 00:03:43.043\nthere's several switches that I\ncan use along with this command.\n\n80\n00:03:43.043 --> 00:03:48.036\nThe primary ones that we're gonna\nfocus on here that we need to\n\n81\n00:03:48.036 --> 00:03:53.140\nunderstand are gonna be the user\nas well as the forward slash S.\n\n82\n00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.768\nForward slash S determines\nwhat machine we're looking at.\n\n83\n00:03:58.768 --> 00:04:01.549\nMost of the time we're talking about\nthe machine we're logged on to,\n\n84\n00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.400\nbut I might be running\nthis command remotely.\n\n85\n00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.159\nSo if you leave out the forward slash S,\nit defaults to the local machine.\n\n86\n00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.308\nThe forward slash user\nspecifies what user.\n\n87\n00:04:10.308 --> 00:04:12.827\nSo what user is logging\non to what machine.\n\n88\n00:04:12.827 --> 00:04:15.395\nCuz, remember,\nthat makes a difference in our results.\n\n89\n00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:19.556\nBecause it's all about where that computer\naccount is in Active Directory, and\n\n90\n00:04:19.556 --> 00:04:22.080\nwhere that user account\nis in Active Directory.\n\n91\n00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.570\nThe confusing one though is this here,\nthe dash or forward slash u.\n\n92\n00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.444\nPeople sometimes try to use that\nto specify what user they want\n\n93\n00:04:30.444 --> 00:04:31.568\nthe results for.\n\n94\n00:04:31.568 --> 00:04:36.627\nThis forward slash u is for\nrunning the command itself.\n\n95\n00:04:36.627 --> 00:04:40.292\nRemember if we are doing our best\npractices I might not be logged on as\n\n96\n00:04:40.292 --> 00:04:41.462\nthe administrator.\n\n97\n00:04:41.462 --> 00:04:44.957\nSo I wanna specify what credentials\nto run this command as.\n\n98\n00:04:44.957 --> 00:04:48.715\nSo that's what the /u and\nthe /p would be for.\n\n99\n00:04:48.715 --> 00:04:51.707\n>> One of the things I was thinking, Mike,\nthere is that you said you might be logged\n\n100\n00:04:51.707 --> 00:04:53.734\nin as the administrator,\nor a standard user, right?\n\n101\n00:04:53.734 --> 00:04:57.269\nSo we don't wanna be running at more\nhigher elevated privileges there.\n\n102\n00:04:57.269 --> 00:04:59.694\nIs there any difference between\nthe output that you might see?\n\n103\n00:04:59.694 --> 00:05:02.917\nLet's say if you're logged in\nas administrator versus what\n\n104\n00:05:02.917 --> 00:05:05.647\na standard user might see,\nor am I jumping the gun?\n\n105\n00:05:05.647 --> 00:05:07.232\n>> No, you're absolutely right.\n\n106\n00:05:07.232 --> 00:05:10.658\nIf you're a standard user and\nyou run this command.\n\n107\n00:05:10.658 --> 00:05:12.771\nYou can see the user setting results.\n\n108\n00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:14.741\nBut you won't see the computer results.\n\n109\n00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:17.398\nSo it'll just look at all the user\npolicies, and all those settings and\n\n110\n00:05:17.398 --> 00:05:18.602\nit'll give you those results.\n\n111\n00:05:18.602 --> 00:05:20.959\nBut it won't show you anything\nto do with the computer account.\n\n112\n00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:23.620\nAnd that could be where your problem lies.\n\n113\n00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.090\nYou run it as an administrator and you'll\nsee the result and set of policies for\n\n114\n00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.999\nthe computer as well as the user.\n\n115\n00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:32.580\nSo any user can actually run GP result.\n\n116\n00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.913\nBut they're just gonna see it\nbased under their context.\n\n117\n00:05:34.913 --> 00:05:38.591\nThey're not gonna see any\nof the machine policies.\n\n118\n00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:40.914\nSo let's take a look at this command.\n\n119\n00:05:40.914 --> 00:05:43.548\nLet me clean up my screen\njust a little bit.\n\n120\n00:05:43.548 --> 00:05:46.319\nAnd I'm gonna do, I'm logged on\nas the administrator right now.\n\n121\n00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:47.396\nSo I'm gonna do a simple one.\n\n122\n00:05:47.396 --> 00:05:51.372\nI'm just gonna do GP result,\nspace, forward slash r, and\n\n123\n00:05:51.372 --> 00:05:54.641\nthat's gonna give me\nresult instead of policy.\n\n124\n00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:55.962\nNow, a lot scrolled by.\n\n125\n00:05:55.962 --> 00:05:58.786\nSo I'll scroll back up to\nwhere I ran that command.\n\n126\n00:05:58.786 --> 00:06:03.134\nAnd I can see RSOP data for\nLAB/Administrator on CLIENT01.\n\n127\n00:06:03.134 --> 00:06:07.386\nI didn't specify forward slash user,\nI didn't specify forward slash s, so\n\n128\n00:06:07.386 --> 00:06:10.143\nit's using whoever I'm\ncurrently logged on as.\n\n129\n00:06:10.143 --> 00:06:14.288\nAnd whatever machine I'm currently logged\nonto or running this command from.\n\n130\n00:06:14.288 --> 00:06:17.916\nAnd then I can see some information\nabout my OS configuration and\n\n131\n00:06:17.916 --> 00:06:19.875\nversion and what site I belong to.\n\n132\n00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:23.438\nRemember this site could make a difference\nif I've got policies linked to the site,\n\n133\n00:06:23.438 --> 00:06:25.808\nand their computer is in\nthe wrong site for some reason.\n\n134\n00:06:25.808 --> 00:06:29.485\nThat would change my\nresultant set of policy.\n\n135\n00:06:29.485 --> 00:06:33.495\nTells me whether or not I'm using roaming\nprofiles, whether it's a slow link.\n\n136\n00:06:33.495 --> 00:06:35.805\nCuz remember,\nthat could change things too.\n\n137\n00:06:35.805 --> 00:06:39.346\nIf it's a slow link then some\nof those CSEs don't fire.\n\n138\n00:06:39.346 --> 00:06:41.032\nRight, it doesn't do\nsoftware installation,\n\n139\n00:06:41.032 --> 00:06:42.313\nit doesn't do folder redirection.\n\n140\n00:06:42.313 --> 00:06:45.780\nOr you might find that you've\ngot a bad cable somewhere.\n\n141\n00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.774\nSo the reason he's never getting the\nfolder redirection is cuz every time they\n\n142\n00:06:49.774 --> 00:06:52.085\nlog on to the machine it\nsees it as a slow link.\n\n143\n00:06:52.085 --> 00:06:56.352\nBecause they've got a switch going bad, or\na cable going bad, or something like that.\n\n144\n00:06:56.352 --> 00:06:59.603\nAs we scroll down I can see\nthe computer settings, and\n\n145\n00:06:59.603 --> 00:07:02.284\nI can see the machines distinguished name.\n\n146\n00:07:02.284 --> 00:07:06.937\nWhich is the path to the object in Active\nDirectory, and that's important, right.\n\n147\n00:07:06.937 --> 00:07:08.481\nWhat if he's in the wrong OU?\n\n148\n00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:12.727\nRemember we're linking policies to the OU,\nas well as the domain and the site.\n\n149\n00:07:12.727 --> 00:07:15.307\nAnd so\nif the client machine is in the wrong OU.\n\n150\n00:07:15.307 --> 00:07:17.949\nThen the wrong policies\nare going to be applied.\n\n151\n00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:20.407\nSo I've got to make sure\nhe's in that right location.\n\n152\n00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:22.528\nAnd it shows me where he is currently, and\n\n153\n00:07:22.528 --> 00:07:25.080\nif it's wrong now I know\ncurrently what to go fix.\n\n154\n00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.326\nScroll down a little further I can\nsee what policies are being applied.\n\n155\n00:07:29.326 --> 00:07:33.560\nFor the machine half the only one is\nthe default domain policy in this case.\n\n156\n00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.900\nAnd then the following\nGPOs were not applied.\n\n157\n00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.940\nBecause they were filtered out.\n\n158\n00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.011\nAnd it tells you why,\nwhich is really cool.\n\n159\n00:07:39.011 --> 00:07:43.013\nSo it's that the local policy\ndoesn't have any settings in it.\n\n160\n00:07:43.013 --> 00:07:43.716\nSo it's empty.\n\n161\n00:07:43.716 --> 00:07:45.423\nSo it doesn't even bother applying it.\n\n162\n00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:45.931\n>> Very good.\n\n163\n00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:48.597\nOne of the other settings that\ni can see up there, Mike.\n\n164\n00:07:48.597 --> 00:07:51.863\nAnd I know that technologies\nlike work folders and\n\n165\n00:07:51.863 --> 00:07:55.293\nworkplace join,\nthese came out in sever 2012.\n\n166\n00:07:55.293 --> 00:07:57.009\nOne of the things that I can see is that,\n\n167\n00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:00.392\nwhen it says domain type is that your\nfunctional level inside of your domain?\n\n168\n00:08:00.392 --> 00:08:02.977\nAnd could you use that for troubleshooting\nmaybe why the settings not fine.\n\n169\n00:08:02.977 --> 00:08:05.948\nAnd I'm thinking like for instance\nsomething that you know that's specific to\n\n170\n00:08:05.948 --> 00:08:07.467\na certain version of a server operator.\n\n171\n00:08:07.467 --> 00:08:08.625\n>> Absolutely right?\n\n172\n00:08:08.625 --> 00:08:11.315\nIf your functional level isn't\nhigh enough it might be now.\n\n173\n00:08:11.315 --> 00:08:14.809\nIt really shouldn't do the client\ndoesn't have anything to do with what\n\n174\n00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:16.366\nthe functional level is set to.\n\n175\n00:08:16.366 --> 00:08:19.238\nBut it could be where my trouble lies,\nright?\n\n176\n00:08:19.238 --> 00:08:22.891\nI could have created a setting somewhere\nin a GPO wonder why it's not getting\n\n177\n00:08:22.891 --> 00:08:23.526\npushed out.\n\n178\n00:08:23.526 --> 00:08:27.670\nAnd maybe it's because they hadn't raised\nthat functional level yet on my domain.\n\n179\n00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.202\n>> So it's valid information for\ntroubleshooting as well.\n\n180\n00:08:30.202 --> 00:08:34.496\nIf you are looking at that information\nlike you said, along with and adjacent to.\n\n181\n00:08:34.496 --> 00:08:37.298\nThe location where the user,\nor in this case the computer,\n\n182\n00:08:37.298 --> 00:08:38.763\nis with inside of your domain.\n\n183\n00:08:38.763 --> 00:08:39.710\n>> Absolutely.\n\n184\n00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.945\nAll right, and\nas we scroll down a little bit further.\n\n185\n00:08:41.945 --> 00:08:44.452\nI can see what groups\nthis computer is part of.\n\n186\n00:08:44.452 --> 00:08:48.272\nRemember, we can do security\nfiltering based on groups.\n\n187\n00:08:48.272 --> 00:08:52.257\nAnd for software installation for\nexample, it's a very common thing to do,\n\n188\n00:08:52.257 --> 00:08:55.029\nbecause I can just link that\nGPO to the domain itself.\n\n189\n00:08:55.029 --> 00:08:58.320\nAnd then any time I need that piece\nof software installed on a machine.\n\n190\n00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.474\nI just add them to that security\ngroup in Active Directory.\n\n191\n00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:04.636\nIt doesn't matter where they are in the OU\nstructure because I linked the policy to\n\n192\n00:09:04.636 --> 00:09:05.313\nthe domain.\n\n193\n00:09:05.313 --> 00:09:07.150\nAnd then we do that security filtering.\n\n194\n00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.267\nSo it only applies to\nthat particular group.\n\n195\n00:09:09.267 --> 00:09:12.438\nSo now I can control who gets the software\njust by adding that machine to\n\n196\n00:09:12.438 --> 00:09:13.257\nthe group or not.\n\n197\n00:09:13.257 --> 00:09:16.264\nSo if it's not in the right group,\nthat's gonna change the outcome, right?\n\n198\n00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.397\nThat's gonna change that RSOP.\n\n199\n00:09:18.397 --> 00:09:21.912\nSo it lists all the groups\nthat that computer belongs to.\n\n200\n00:09:21.912 --> 00:09:23.700\nAnd then we basically rise and repeat.\n\n201\n00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.149\nWe've got this same information down\nhere for the user settings, right?\n\n202\n00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:31.422\nWhere that user account is in active\ndirectory the last time group policy was\n\n203\n00:09:31.422 --> 00:09:32.030\napplied.\n\n204\n00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.836\nYou might find that it's having\ntrouble retrieving group policy and\n\n205\n00:09:35.836 --> 00:09:38.600\nit hasn't applied it since two days ago,\nright?\n\n206\n00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.790\nIt's just been using cached\ncopies of those GPO's.\n\n207\n00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:45.036\nSo any changes I've made\naren't gonna show up, right.\n\n208\n00:09:45.036 --> 00:09:47.024\nI've been trouble shooting I\nthink I've fixed the problem.\n\n209\n00:09:47.024 --> 00:09:49.132\nThe machines still having the problem,\nwhy?\n\n210\n00:09:49.132 --> 00:09:51.908\nWell, because it's not retrieving\npolicy like it's supposed to.\n\n211\n00:09:51.908 --> 00:09:54.360\nMaybe it's got a connectivity issue,\na DNS issue,\n\n212\n00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.268\ntrying to find that domain controller.\n\n213\n00:09:56.268 --> 00:09:58.726\nThere can be a number of things there.\n\n214\n00:09:58.726 --> 00:10:01.693\nAs we scroll down,\napply group policy objects.\n\n215\n00:10:01.693 --> 00:10:03.729\nSo it shows me what are applied and\n\n216\n00:10:03.729 --> 00:10:06.873\nthen again what ones are not\nbeing Applied and why?\n\n217\n00:10:06.873 --> 00:10:10.409\n>> You know I got a question\nwith the being filtered out.\n\n218\n00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:13.421\nWould we see something like maybe\nyou know that in other episodes\n\n219\n00:10:13.421 --> 00:10:16.341\nMike talked pretty extensively\nabout the processing order.\n\n220\n00:10:16.341 --> 00:10:18.921\nWould the processing order if\nconflicting settings here,\n\n221\n00:10:18.921 --> 00:10:22.025\nwould they maybe be filtered out if\nyou have two conflicting settings?\n\n222\n00:10:22.025 --> 00:10:23.737\nOr is that might not be\nsomething that we'd see here?\n\n223\n00:10:23.737 --> 00:10:26.561\n>> You know unfortunately\nyou don't see that in here.\n\n224\n00:10:26.561 --> 00:10:30.746\nHere it's just showing you whether or\nnot the policy is even being applied.\n\n225\n00:10:30.746 --> 00:10:34.383\nIt's not really looking at\nthe settings themselves.\n\n226\n00:10:34.383 --> 00:10:37.519\nWe do have tools that we can\nuse to get to that level.\n\n227\n00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:40.616\nBut this particular tool\nonly shows me whether or\n\n228\n00:10:40.616 --> 00:10:45.235\nnot the policies are being retrieved and\napplied on that machine or not.\n\n229\n00:10:45.235 --> 00:10:50.219\nBut it doesn't show me the actual end\nresult like this policy had a 30 minute\n\n230\n00:10:50.219 --> 00:10:51.763\nscreensaver time out.\n\n231\n00:10:51.763 --> 00:10:55.408\nBut one applied later,\nhad a ten minute screensaver time out.\n\n232\n00:10:55.408 --> 00:10:59.010\nAnd then one that was applied later\nhad a 15 minute screensaver time out.\n\n233\n00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:00.498\nSo you end with 15 minutes.\n\n234\n00:11:00.498 --> 00:11:02.021\nIt doesn't show me that there.\n\n235\n00:11:02.021 --> 00:11:04.373\nIt's just showing me what\npolicies are applied, and\n\n236\n00:11:04.373 --> 00:11:06.370\nwhich ones are being filtered out.\n\n237\n00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:06.970\n>> Very good.\nAnd so\n\n238\n00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.650\nthat might be something that you\nwould find maybe on the server side,\n\n239\n00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:11.010\nnot necessarily on the client side.\n\n240\n00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:11.852\n>> Yeah.\n>> Very good.\n\n241\n00:11:11.852 --> 00:11:13.844\n>> Well, and\nusing the group management policy console.\n\n242\n00:11:13.844 --> 00:11:18.699\nSo if I had installed the RSAT on\nthis machine, I could fire up that.\n\n243\n00:11:18.699 --> 00:11:20.243\nAnd we're gonna take a look\nat those tools as well.\n\n244\n00:11:20.243 --> 00:11:21.002\n>> All right, very good.\n\n245\n00:11:21.002 --> 00:11:23.714\n>> All right, and\nthen you continue to scroll down, and\n\n246\n00:11:23.714 --> 00:11:25.410\nwhat groups the user belongs to.\n\n247\n00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.458\nSame logic right, I need to know.\n\n248\n00:11:28.458 --> 00:11:32.167\nI might see that, hey that was\nsuppose to be security filtered,\n\n249\n00:11:32.167 --> 00:11:34.655\nonly if you're in that developers group.\n\n250\n00:11:34.655 --> 00:11:36.991\nLike that policy that we\ndid in a previous episode.\n\n251\n00:11:36.991 --> 00:11:40.777\nWhere I allowed certain developers\nto have access to regedit.\n\n252\n00:11:40.777 --> 00:11:43.660\nI blocked it at the domain, but\nthen if you're in this group,\n\n253\n00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.220\nyou could get access to regedit.\n\n254\n00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.524\nWell I could come in here and say.\n\n255\n00:11:46.524 --> 00:11:47.969\nLook you're not in that group.\n\n256\n00:11:47.969 --> 00:11:50.684\nThat's why you don't\nhave access to regedit.\n\n257\n00:11:50.684 --> 00:11:54.288\nSo now I need to go to Active Directory,\nand make sure I add that user account to\n\n258\n00:11:54.288 --> 00:11:57.016\nthat group, or\nat least start my troubleshooting there.\n\n259\n00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:59.185\nAre they supposed to\nhave access to regedit?\n\n260\n00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:01.207\nIf so Why aren't they in that group?\n\n261\n00:12:01.207 --> 00:12:02.225\nLet's add.\n\n262\n00:12:02.225 --> 00:12:07.260\nRun RSOP again, and\nwe should be good to go.\n\n263\n00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.440\nSo that's a basic run of this, I'll show\nyou another example here, if I wanted to,\n\n264\n00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.760\nlet's say I want to see what's happening\nwhen Rob logs onto this machine.\n\n265\n00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.110\nI can take that same command and\njust add a forward slash user, and\n\n266\n00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:21.710\nthen lab slash Rob.\n\n267\n00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.846\nAnd it'll do the same,\nyou know I get the same output, but\n\n268\n00:12:24.846 --> 00:12:28.509\nif we scroll back up to the top,\nI'll see, let's find my command.\n\n269\n00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:29.112\nRight?\n\n270\n00:12:29.112 --> 00:12:30.238\nThere's my command.\n\n271\n00:12:30.238 --> 00:12:33.710\nIt's showing me information about the\ncomputer, and that hasn't changed, right?\n\n272\n00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:36.437\nThat's independent of who's logging on.\n\n273\n00:12:36.437 --> 00:12:41.450\nBut down below, I see, now,\nI'm looking at Rob, where his account is.\n\n274\n00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.340\nAnd you'll see it looks\na little different.\n\n275\n00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:47.280\nThe only apply policies\nare Map Data Drive and IT Pro Standards.\n\n276\n00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.950\nThe ones that are being filtered,\nDev Standards is being filter disabled,\n\n277\n00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.760\nthat link is turned off.\n\n278\n00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.000\nNo wonder the settings aren't applied.\n\n279\n00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.120\nSomeone disabled the link on that GPO.\n\n280\n00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.527\nOr that's why, that policy is empty.\n\n281\n00:13:00.527 --> 00:13:03.406\nThis one is being denied for\nsecurity reasons, right.\n\n282\n00:13:03.406 --> 00:13:06.203\nSo that means some security\nfiltering is going on.\n\n283\n00:13:06.203 --> 00:13:10.139\nIn fact that one is that WMI right,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n284\n00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:12.370\nIt's been a little while\nsince we showed that so.\n\n285\n00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.979\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I think that was our WMI filter.\n\n286\n00:13:14.979 --> 00:13:19.250\nAgain, good information about just\nwhat policies are being applied, and\n\n287\n00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:20.957\nthis is always where I start.\n\n288\n00:13:20.957 --> 00:13:24.129\nWhen I think there's\na problem with group policy,\n\n289\n00:13:24.129 --> 00:13:26.577\none of the first things I do is run this.\n\n290\n00:13:26.577 --> 00:13:31.349\nBecause I'm not going to spend a lot of\ntime going into group policy management.\n\n291\n00:13:31.349 --> 00:13:33.608\nLooking at all the settings,\nand looking at the GPOs and\n\n292\n00:13:33.608 --> 00:13:35.280\ntrying to figure out what's wrong.\n\n293\n00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.626\nCome to find out the policy is not\neven being applied to the machine or\n\n294\n00:13:39.626 --> 00:13:44.427\nbeing applied to the user, so that's\nthe first thing I want to see is does it\n\n295\n00:13:44.427 --> 00:13:47.730\neven know that it's suppose\nto apply that policy.\n\n296\n00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.788\nOnce I'm sure that it's being applied,\nthen I can go back and I can figure out\n\n297\n00:13:51.788 --> 00:13:55.797\nwhat's wrong with the policy, why it's\nnot and you know things like that.\n\n298\n00:13:55.797 --> 00:13:59.592\nSo this is always where I start, there's a\ncouple other options you can do with this,\n\n299\n00:13:59.592 --> 00:14:00.976\nand I'll show you real quick.\n\n300\n00:14:00.976 --> 00:14:06.418\nWe can add a forward slash v\nto create a verbose output,\n\n301\n00:14:06.418 --> 00:14:12.470\nand you'll see that it does spit\nout a lot more information.\n\n302\n00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:15.394\nAll of the same information is there and\nI'll just focus on the user.\n\n303\n00:14:15.394 --> 00:14:20.049\nSo applied and filtered and what groups,\nbut then it adds a little information.\n\n304\n00:14:20.049 --> 00:14:22.556\nThe user has the following\nsecurity privileges.\n\n305\n00:14:22.556 --> 00:14:25.366\nSo it's showing my some of my rights and\nprivileges that are assigned.\n\n306\n00:14:25.366 --> 00:14:28.321\nIt shows me this result and\nset up policy for user and\n\n307\n00:14:28.321 --> 00:14:33.132\nif we get down to like administrative\ntemplates, it'll show me that, well,\n\n308\n00:14:33.132 --> 00:14:37.428\nthat policy, ITPro standards,\nhas a setting for screensaver timeout.\n\n309\n00:14:37.428 --> 00:14:40.933\nBut notice it doesn't really\ntell me what the setting is.\n\n310\n00:14:40.933 --> 00:14:46.273\nI have yet to be able to decipher this,\nso I really don't find\n\n311\n00:14:46.273 --> 00:14:52.264\nthis being all that useful,\nthe verbose output, but maybe you do.\n\n312\n00:14:52.264 --> 00:14:56.019\nMaybe you want to dive in and\nfigure out what that actually means, but\n\n313\n00:14:56.019 --> 00:14:57.523\nI haven't even bothered.\n\n314\n00:14:57.523 --> 00:15:02.203\nIf we, you can also do a switch z,\nwhich is for very verbose, and\n\n315\n00:15:02.203 --> 00:15:05.499\nyou can see it scrolls\na little bit further but\n\n316\n00:15:05.499 --> 00:15:11.442\nyou really don't see that much additional\ninformation or useful information.\n\n317\n00:15:11.442 --> 00:15:14.473\nAgain, I'm sure it's useful to somebody.\n\n318\n00:15:14.473 --> 00:15:18.731\nFor normal group policy trouble shooting\nthough, I haven't found verbose or\n\n319\n00:15:18.731 --> 00:15:20.289\nvery verbose to be all that.\n\n320\n00:15:20.289 --> 00:15:23.313\n>> It sounds like we need to rename\nthat one, boy you asked for it,\n\n321\n00:15:23.313 --> 00:15:24.409\nhere it comes switch.\n\n322\n00:15:24.409 --> 00:15:26.464\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, right?\n\n323\n00:15:26.464 --> 00:15:31.369\nAll right, now, another cool thing we\ncan do with this is we can actually spit\n\n324\n00:15:31.369 --> 00:15:35.088\nthis out into an HTML format,\nso if I do that same command.\n\n325\n00:15:35.088 --> 00:15:37.880\nI'm going to take away that switch z,\nand let's take a look.\n\n326\n00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:43.528\nActually, let's flip back up here,\nand I'll show you that.\n\n327\n00:15:43.528 --> 00:15:48.380\nYou can do a forward slash H and\nthen file name, and\n\n328\n00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.180\nI can spit it out into an Html format, or\n\n329\n00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.430\nI can do a forward slash X and\nI can spit it out as an Xml format.\n\n330\n00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:59.420\nXml being a mark up language\nwhere we can define our own tags.\n\n331\n00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:04.310\nSo you might want to import this\ndata into some other application or\n\n332\n00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.570\ninto a database for further analysis.\n\n333\n00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.360\nXml's a great format for that, right,\n\n334\n00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.470\nit's kind of a neutral format that I can\ngo from this to some other language.\n\n335\n00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.386\nSo I want to dump this\nall into a database and\n\n336\n00:16:15.386 --> 00:16:18.229\nmaybe I want to run\nreports on it that way.\n\n337\n00:16:18.229 --> 00:16:22.424\nThe H for HTML, and let's go ahead and\nrun that, let's do a,\n\n338\n00:16:22.424 --> 00:16:26.402\nfind that command again,\nwe'll do without the verbose.\n\n339\n00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:29.628\nForward slash h, and\n\n340\n00:16:29.628 --> 00:16:34.826\nthen let's do c colon backslash,\n\n341\n00:16:34.826 --> 00:16:38.418\nrob dot h t, oops html.\n\n342\n00:16:38.418 --> 00:16:39.845\nAll right, and it didn't like that.\n\n343\n00:16:39.845 --> 00:16:43.386\n>> I think it's a del on the end of it,\ntry taking that.\n\n344\n00:16:43.386 --> 00:16:49.400\n>> What did I do there, I'd say I think\nyou cannot include, do the verbose.\n\n345\n00:16:55.505 --> 00:16:59.256\nOr it's not liking where I'm writing that,\nlet's see.\n\n346\n00:16:59.256 --> 00:17:01.205\nDoes it take that L off there?\n\n347\n00:17:01.205 --> 00:17:06.743\nIt's not liking, can't do the /u, /p, /r.\n\n348\n00:17:06.743 --> 00:17:07.881\nCan't do an /r with that.\n\n349\n00:17:07.881 --> 00:17:09.542\nThat's what it was.\n\n350\n00:17:09.542 --> 00:17:10.285\nI'm going to get rid of that r.\n\n351\n00:17:10.285 --> 00:17:11.666\nI forgot that guy was up there.\n\n352\n00:17:11.666 --> 00:17:12.745\n>> You have crossed the streams.\n\n353\n00:17:12.745 --> 00:17:13.582\n>> There we go, yep.\n\n354\n00:17:13.582 --> 00:17:18.224\nBecause r is for spitting it out\nto the screen and I can't do both.\n\n355\n00:17:18.224 --> 00:17:21.057\nIt's either send it out to the file or\nsend it out to the screen.\n\n356\n00:17:21.057 --> 00:17:22.460\nSo that's why it was yelling at me there.\n\n357\n00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.060\nAnd now if I go and open up File Explorer\nand go over to the C drive.\n\n358\n00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.698\nThere's my HTML file.\n\n359\n00:17:27.698 --> 00:17:28.537\nI open that up, and\n\n360\n00:17:28.537 --> 00:17:31.540\nof course it's going to open up\nin everybody's favorite browser.\n\n361\n00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:36.973\nThe block content there, it's uses\nactive edge to this show and hide.\n\n362\n00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:41.815\nSo if you want to have that functionally,\nallow the block content.\n\n363\n00:17:41.815 --> 00:17:43.892\nIf you don't,\ndon't allow the block content.\n\n364\n00:17:43.892 --> 00:17:46.818\nBut you can see it's a really nice report.\n\n365\n00:17:46.818 --> 00:17:51.523\nShows me the same information and then\nsome that I can see when the policy was\n\n366\n00:17:51.523 --> 00:17:55.406\nlast refreshed, and these guys,\nwhen they were refreshed,\n\n367\n00:17:55.406 --> 00:17:59.587\nand then I scroll down, and\nI get information about the computer,\n\n368\n00:17:59.587 --> 00:18:04.366\nabout the component status, and\nthen down below, the actually settings,\n\n369\n00:18:04.366 --> 00:18:09.324\nand then if I can find one, let's see\nhere if I can find a conflicting setting.\n\n370\n00:18:09.324 --> 00:18:14.327\nGroup policy objects apply,\nGPS, here we go.\n\n371\n00:18:14.327 --> 00:18:17.368\nI'm trying to find one where I've got two.\n\n372\n00:18:17.368 --> 00:18:23.347\nRemember we've got screen saver time\nouts defined at the domain level.\n\n373\n00:18:23.347 --> 00:18:26.662\nI've got a policy called\nIT Prostandards and Rob,\n\n374\n00:18:26.662 --> 00:18:29.059\nI guess doesn't have the other one.\n\n375\n00:18:29.059 --> 00:18:32.739\nBut what's cool about this it\nshows you what the winning GPO is.\n\n376\n00:18:32.739 --> 00:18:37.069\nWhereas that the results from\nthe command line didn't show me that.\n\n377\n00:18:37.069 --> 00:18:38.340\nSo if there was another policy.\n\n378\n00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:42.577\nAnd let's see,\nlet's go enable that link real quick.\n\n379\n00:18:42.577 --> 00:18:48.811\nI think we had disabled that in a previous\nepisode and I forgot my password there.\n\n380\n00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:53.269\nSo we're going to fire up that\ngroup policy management console.\n\n381\n00:18:53.269 --> 00:18:57.669\nAnd I'll go check on that guy.\n\n382\n00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:58.494\nWhere was I?\n\n383\n00:18:58.494 --> 00:19:03.381\nEmployees, developers, and yep,\nthat DEV standards was disabled so\n\n384\n00:19:03.381 --> 00:19:04.855\nlet's enable that.\n\n385\n00:19:04.855 --> 00:19:08.628\nTurn that back on, and\nsee what happens to my report now.\n\n386\n00:19:08.628 --> 00:19:11.714\nAll right, so\nhere I've got screen saver timeout,\n\n387\n00:19:11.714 --> 00:19:15.373\n600 seconds, winning GPO,\nIP Pro standard, all right?\n\n388\n00:19:15.373 --> 00:19:21.874\nNow I'm just going to rerun that report.\n\n389\n00:19:21.874 --> 00:19:24.254\nAnd I forgot to delete the original.\n\n390\n00:19:24.254 --> 00:19:28.688\nIt won't let you just replace the name,\nyou'd have to give it a separate name, or\n\n391\n00:19:28.688 --> 00:19:30.130\ndelete this one.\n\n392\n00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:32.440\nJust let me get rid of that guy.\n\n393\n00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.720\nDo that again.\n\n394\n00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:40.653\nThen we'll flip over, and there's\nmy report, we'll take a look at it,\n\n395\n00:19:40.653 --> 00:19:44.553\nwe'll scroll down to that user section,\nand evidently,\n\n396\n00:19:44.553 --> 00:19:49.348\nit's still 600 seconds,\nI forgot which policy actually has that.\n\n397\n00:19:49.348 --> 00:19:50.056\nYou know what?\n\n398\n00:19:50.056 --> 00:19:54.050\nThe heck with that, let's change it,\nlet's modify this guy.\n\n399\n00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:59.953\nLet's do an edit, and we go to user\npolicies, administrative templates,\n\n400\n00:19:59.953 --> 00:20:04.672\ncontrol panel, personalization,\nscreen saver time out.\n\n401\n00:20:04.672 --> 00:20:07.660\nLet's set to 1200 seconds.\n\n402\n00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.190\nNow let's, you know what I didn't do?\n\n403\n00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.760\nI did not refresh that policy.\n\n404\n00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.190\nLet's do a GP update.\n\n405\n00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:19.190\nForgot I made a change to that policy.\n\n406\n00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:25.749\nGp updates which, switch force,\nwe'll refresh that real quick.\n\n407\n00:20:25.749 --> 00:20:31.774\nAnd, wait for it, wait for it.\n\n408\n00:20:31.774 --> 00:20:35.449\nAnd while it's doing that,\n\n409\n00:20:35.449 --> 00:20:39.436\nI'll delete that old report.\n\n410\n00:20:39.436 --> 00:20:40.469\nWe'll delete that there.\n\n411\n00:20:40.469 --> 00:20:43.570\nAnd then we're going to run that again.\n\n412\n00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:44.869\nAnd we'll check it one more time.\n\n413\n00:20:47.957 --> 00:20:51.231\nScroll on down till we find that guy.\n\n414\n00:20:51.231 --> 00:20:55.805\nSo we really should probably do\nsome troubleshooting on this,\n\n415\n00:20:55.805 --> 00:21:00.206\nbecause it looks like, Rob,\nwhen logging on this machine,\n\n416\n00:21:00.206 --> 00:21:04.723\nis still getting 600 seconds\non his screensaver time out.\n\n417\n00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:07.940\nSo let's see why that is going on here.\n\n418\n00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.099\nMake sure.\n\n419\n00:21:10.099 --> 00:21:12.365\nTell you what,\nat this point what I would want to do,\n\n420\n00:21:12.365 --> 00:21:14.382\nis I would start with my simple stuff,\nright.\n\n421\n00:21:14.382 --> 00:21:20.594\nI do my gpresult, switch r, and\nmake sure that policy's being applied.\n\n422\n00:21:20.594 --> 00:21:23.496\nAnd, it is not being applied.\n\n423\n00:21:23.496 --> 00:21:28.476\nNotice I do not see,\nwhat was that policy called even?\n\n424\n00:21:28.476 --> 00:21:29.498\nLet's double check on that.\n\n425\n00:21:29.498 --> 00:21:31.159\nGroup Policy Management.\n\n426\n00:21:31.159 --> 00:21:35.003\nDev Standards is linked.\n\n427\n00:21:35.003 --> 00:21:38.216\nAnd as far as the settings go,\nmake sure those are right.\n\n428\n00:21:42.396 --> 00:21:46.722\nDo everything,\n1200 seconds from a screensaver timeout,\n\n429\n00:21:46.722 --> 00:21:48.883\nas we scroll back over here, and\n\n430\n00:21:48.883 --> 00:21:54.123\nactually dev standards is not in my\nlist of applied group policy objects.\n\n431\n00:21:54.123 --> 00:21:56.069\nAnd you know why?\n\n432\n00:21:56.069 --> 00:21:56.825\nSee, there we go.\n\n433\n00:21:56.825 --> 00:21:59.438\nA good use of this G P result.\n\n434\n00:21:59.438 --> 00:22:02.789\nLook who its It's running the policy as,\nor this setting as,\n\n435\n00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:04.534\nall right, as administrator.\n\n436\n00:22:04.534 --> 00:22:12.985\nSo if I go and\nchange that to a switch user lab\\rob.\n\n437\n00:22:12.985 --> 00:22:16.108\nNow I can see that dev\nstandards is being filtered.\n\n438\n00:22:16.108 --> 00:22:19.452\nThe link is still showing as disabled.\n\n439\n00:22:19.452 --> 00:22:22.830\nNow we know that link is enabled,\nI just turned it on.\n\n440\n00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:24.077\nSo at this point what I would do is,\n\n441\n00:22:24.077 --> 00:22:26.615\nI would just do a quick\nreboot on the client machine.\n\n442\n00:22:26.615 --> 00:22:28.763\nJust to freshen things up.\n\n443\n00:22:28.763 --> 00:22:31.295\nIt's a user setting,\nI think I'll just sign out.\n\n444\n00:22:31.295 --> 00:22:35.515\nAnd we'll go ahead and log in as Rob.\n\n445\n00:22:35.515 --> 00:22:38.895\n>> So at this point, I mean,\nthis utility is very, very important.\n\n446\n00:22:38.895 --> 00:22:42.255\nYou can see right there in action\nhow if a setting is not applying,\n\n447\n00:22:42.255 --> 00:22:45.203\nthat you know hey,\nI set that before, what's going on?\n\n448\n00:22:45.203 --> 00:22:47.907\nYou could see right here,\nhands on, it is a great utility for\n\n449\n00:22:47.907 --> 00:22:50.084\ntroubleshooting why something is applying,\nor\n\n450\n00:22:50.084 --> 00:22:53.125\nI guess you'd be troubleshooting\nwhy it's not applying, right?\n\n451\n00:22:53.125 --> 00:22:54.564\n>> Yeah, exactly right.\n\n452\n00:22:54.564 --> 00:23:00.205\nSo let's see if we can\ndo GP results as Rob.\n\n453\n00:23:00.205 --> 00:23:03.645\nSo I long on as Rob so\nI don't have to specify the user,\n\n454\n00:23:03.645 --> 00:23:07.125\nand now I see the Deb standard is\nbeing applied, so let's log off.\n\n455\n00:23:07.125 --> 00:23:11.045\nSo I'll tell you what we'll do is, I know\nwe''ve been kind of long winded on this,\n\n456\n00:23:11.045 --> 00:23:13.185\nthere's a couple other\ntools I wanna show you,\n\n457\n00:23:13.185 --> 00:23:15.105\nwe'll use a different tool to\nfinish the verification on this.\n\n458\n00:23:15.105 --> 00:23:17.801\nSo, now I know that\npolicy's being applied.\n\n459\n00:23:17.801 --> 00:23:19.078\nIn fact, we can verify it this way.\n\n460\n00:23:19.078 --> 00:23:22.327\nWe could say personalize and\nwe can say screen saver and\n\n461\n00:23:22.327 --> 00:23:26.078\nnotice it is the 1200 seconds,\nnow it is the 20 minutes.\n\n462\n00:23:26.078 --> 00:23:30.173\nSo policy was being cached probably,\nso logging off and logging on is\n\n463\n00:23:30.173 --> 00:23:34.115\nupdated those policy settings and\nnow everything should be good.\n\n464\n00:23:34.115 --> 00:23:38.225\nIf we go back over, now I'm gonna go\nback over to the Domain Controller and\n\n465\n00:23:38.225 --> 00:23:41.485\nshow you another way we can get\nthose group policy results.\n\n466\n00:23:41.485 --> 00:23:42.303\nWe can do it from right here.\n\n467\n00:23:42.303 --> 00:23:44.493\nWe don't have to go to the machine,\n\n468\n00:23:44.493 --> 00:23:49.185\nwhich is probably a more common\nscenario depending how it's structured.\n\n469\n00:23:49.185 --> 00:23:51.923\nRight, if Rob is in a different building,\nin a different location.\n\n470\n00:23:51.923 --> 00:23:55.285\nI can't just really walk over there and\nrun this command.\n\n471\n00:23:55.285 --> 00:23:58.195\nSo I've got this group policy\nresults wizard in my group policy\n\n472\n00:23:58.195 --> 00:23:58.925\nmanagement consult.\n\n473\n00:23:58.925 --> 00:24:03.755\nSo I'm just gonna right click on that and\nchoose group policy result wizard.\n\n474\n00:24:03.755 --> 00:24:04.933\nAnd choose our client machine.\n\n475\n00:24:04.933 --> 00:24:11.664\nWhich was lab/client01, we click next.\n\n476\n00:24:11.664 --> 00:24:16.404\nAgain it's gonna reach out to client one,\nlook at all the profiles that exist on\n\n477\n00:24:16.404 --> 00:24:21.315\nthat machine, give me a list to pick from,\nand takes it's sweet time doing that.\n\n478\n00:24:21.315 --> 00:24:25.615\nAnd what we should see is\nwhen I run this as Ronny,\n\n479\n00:24:25.615 --> 00:24:31.035\nbecause he's not in that that debts\nstandard policy is not applying to him.\n\n480\n00:24:31.035 --> 00:24:34.995\nSo the winning GPO should be the one\nthat's linked at the domain,\n\n481\n00:24:34.995 --> 00:24:37.415\nwhich was the ITPro standard.\n\n482\n00:24:37.415 --> 00:24:42.254\nSo we'll choose Ronny, and Next,\nand we'll generate that report.\n\n483\n00:24:42.254 --> 00:24:48.015\nWe'll give it a second to create that\nreport, and we'll see what happens.\n\n484\n00:24:48.015 --> 00:24:49.825\nSo again, just really good information.\n\n485\n00:24:49.825 --> 00:24:52.935\nThis is what we use when we're\ntrying to troubleshoot GPOs,\n\n486\n00:24:52.935 --> 00:24:54.955\ntrying to figure out why\na policy isn't applying.\n\n487\n00:24:54.955 --> 00:24:57.235\nOr why one is applying and\nit shouldn't be.\n\n488\n00:24:57.235 --> 00:24:59.835\nMaybe I didn't put them\nin the right group, and\n\n489\n00:24:59.835 --> 00:25:01.715\nso the security filtering\nisn't kicking in.\n\n490\n00:25:01.715 --> 00:25:05.976\nBut it's a great place to\ntroubleshoot cuz otherwise,\n\n491\n00:25:05.976 --> 00:25:08.705\nI'm just opening up every policy.\n\n492\n00:25:08.705 --> 00:25:09.635\nAnd I'm looking at the settings.\n\n493\n00:25:09.635 --> 00:25:12.115\nOr I'm going to every\npolicy's access control list,\n\n494\n00:25:12.115 --> 00:25:13.985\nand I'm trying to figure\nout what's going on.\n\n495\n00:25:13.985 --> 00:25:17.885\nThis way, it does all of that, and\ngenerates these nice reports for me.\n\n496\n00:25:17.885 --> 00:25:21.975\nSo if I scroll down,\nI can see that for the user details.\n\n497\n00:25:23.265 --> 00:25:25.285\nI can see ITPro standards\nis being applied,\n\n498\n00:25:25.285 --> 00:25:27.855\nbut notice,\ndev standards is not being applied.\n\n499\n00:25:27.855 --> 00:25:31.625\nAnd if I expand out the settings,\nand I look at that control panel\n\n500\n00:25:31.625 --> 00:25:36.795\npersonalization, sure enough,\nthe ITProTV standard's the winning policy,\n\n501\n00:25:36.795 --> 00:25:39.585\nbecause dev standards isn't being applied,\nright?\n\n502\n00:25:39.585 --> 00:25:44.525\nNot in that OU, so\nhe's got a 600 second screensaver timeout.\n\n503\n00:25:44.525 --> 00:25:47.275\nAnd again you can re-run\nthese at any time.\n\n504\n00:25:47.275 --> 00:25:50.225\nI won't do it, but if you right click\non it you can choose re-run query.\n\n505\n00:25:50.225 --> 00:25:53.385\nSo if you had had a problem,\nand you tried to fix it, and\n\n506\n00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:54.905\nyou want to see if you fixed it.\n\n507\n00:25:54.905 --> 00:25:57.495\nYou don't have to go through\nall of that wizard again.\n\n508\n00:25:57.495 --> 00:26:00.725\nYou can just right click on here, and\nsay re-run query, and it will go and\n\n509\n00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:04.605\nanalyze it all over again,\nand show you the new results.\n\n510\n00:26:04.605 --> 00:26:08.085\nAlright, so both of those tools\nthe GP result from the command line,\n\n511\n00:26:08.085 --> 00:26:12.565\nas well as the group\npolicy results Wizard in\n\n512\n00:26:12.565 --> 00:26:17.855\nthe Group Policy Management console\nare showing me what actually happened.\n\n513\n00:26:17.855 --> 00:26:18.846\nThis is what happens when Ronnie\nlogged on to this machine.\n\n514\n00:26:18.846 --> 00:26:21.304\nOr, when Rob logs on to this machine.\n\n515\n00:26:21.304 --> 00:26:23.137\nThis is the end result.\n\n516\n00:26:23.137 --> 00:26:27.305\nSometimes, however, we want to do\nwhat we call a what If analysis.\n\n517\n00:26:27.305 --> 00:26:32.975\nWhat if, Ronnie's had never\nlogged on to Client One?\n\n518\n00:26:32.975 --> 00:26:34.975\nI can't run GP results because they have.\n\n519\n00:26:34.975 --> 00:26:37.875\nHave to have a profile on that machine,\nright?\n\n520\n00:26:37.875 --> 00:26:44.595\nBut the group policy modeling wizard\nallows me to do what if scenarios.\n\n521\n00:26:44.595 --> 00:26:47.625\nWhat if Ronnie was to\nlog on to client one?\n\n522\n00:26:47.625 --> 00:26:49.415\nOr what if Ronnie logged on to server one?\n\n523\n00:26:49.415 --> 00:26:52.605\nHe's never done it before,\nbut what if he did?\n\n524\n00:26:52.605 --> 00:26:54.095\nWhat would the end results be?\n\n525\n00:26:54.095 --> 00:26:55.525\nIt allows me to do some,\n\n526\n00:26:55.525 --> 00:26:59.105\nas I said what if analysis without\nactually moving anything around, right?\n\n527\n00:26:59.105 --> 00:27:03.875\nAnd it's very very cool, so\ninstead of having to drag\n\n528\n00:27:03.875 --> 00:27:07.055\nobjects in active directory and\nlink and unlink things to do testing.\n\n529\n00:27:07.055 --> 00:27:08.755\nI can test it using this wizard.\n\n530\n00:27:08.755 --> 00:27:12.535\nWe'll fire it up group policy\nmodeling wizard, I'll click next.\n\n531\n00:27:12.535 --> 00:27:16.395\nAnd I get to choose everything what domain\ncontrollers am I gonna test, maybe I think\n\n532\n00:27:16.395 --> 00:27:20.325\none domain controllers working right,\nand a different domain controller isn't.\n\n533\n00:27:20.325 --> 00:27:23.089\nSo I could chose what domain controller.\n\n534\n00:27:23.089 --> 00:27:27.708\nThe user information I can pick an\nindividual user or I can pick a container.\n\n535\n00:27:27.708 --> 00:27:32.711\nI'll go ahead and choose Ronnie again.\n\n536\n00:27:32.711 --> 00:27:39.896\nSo we'll do lab backslash Ronnie and\nfor the computer I'll just go ahead and\n\n537\n00:27:39.896 --> 00:27:43.832\nchoose that same one, lab slash client.\n\n538\n00:27:43.832 --> 00:27:49.881\nWe'll click next, and I can't find\nthat computer of client 01 but\n\n539\n00:27:49.881 --> 00:27:52.087\nno, we'll click next.\n\n540\n00:27:52.087 --> 00:27:56.451\nDo I wanna pretend if there's a slow\nlink or that it is at a different site?\n\n541\n00:27:56.451 --> 00:27:58.085\nI'll click Next.\n\n542\n00:27:58.085 --> 00:28:01.285\nAnd then where is that\nuser's account located?\n\n543\n00:28:01.285 --> 00:28:04.286\nWell, I wanna know what would happen\nif Ronnie wasn't in the Host OU?\n\n544\n00:28:04.286 --> 00:28:08.425\nWhat if Ronnie was in the Dev OU instead?\n\n545\n00:28:08.425 --> 00:28:14.521\nSo I can come down here to Employees and\nGNV and Developers and click OK.\n\n546\n00:28:14.521 --> 00:28:16.405\nAnd then I'll Lleave\nthe computer in that same OU,\n\n547\n00:28:16.405 --> 00:28:19.165\nbut same thing I could move\nthe computer to a different OU.\n\n548\n00:28:19.165 --> 00:28:20.865\nNot actually move it, right.\n\n549\n00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:24.295\nJust see what would\nhappen if I did move it.\n\n550\n00:28:24.295 --> 00:28:25.715\nI'll click next.\n\n551\n00:28:25.715 --> 00:28:31.205\nAnd then what if I want to change\nwhat group Ronnie belongs to?\n\n552\n00:28:31.205 --> 00:28:34.665\nAgain, without actually having to go\nto Ronnie's account and change it.\n\n553\n00:28:34.665 --> 00:28:36.928\nI can say well what if he\nwas in that host group.\n\n554\n00:28:36.928 --> 00:28:42.188\nOr remember we do some security\nfiltering based on membership of the.\n\n555\n00:28:42.188 --> 00:28:46.868\nThere was allow regedit, so let's add and\n\n556\n00:28:46.868 --> 00:28:50.383\nfind that allow regedit group.\n\n557\n00:28:50.383 --> 00:28:53.408\nAll right, well, what would that\nchange in my resultant set of policy,\n\n558\n00:28:53.408 --> 00:28:54.609\nif Ronnie was in that group?\n\n559\n00:28:54.609 --> 00:28:56.421\nIt doesn't actually add it to him, right?\n\n560\n00:28:56.421 --> 00:28:58.685\nIt's just doing a what if analysis.\n\n561\n00:28:58.685 --> 00:28:59.880\nWe'll click next.\n\n562\n00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:04.195\nI could change the groups\nthat the computer belongs to.\n\n563\n00:29:04.195 --> 00:29:08.795\nI could change any W my filters,\n\n564\n00:29:08.795 --> 00:29:14.585\nmaybe I want to apply that notepad\nshortcut filter that I had.\n\n565\n00:29:14.585 --> 00:29:16.035\nLet's not do that though,\ni'm gonna remove that.\n\n566\n00:29:16.035 --> 00:29:20.185\nI'll click Next And then I get my summary.\n\n567\n00:29:20.185 --> 00:29:27.375\nI'll click next, finish, and\nit's gonna generate that report and\n\n568\n00:29:27.375 --> 00:29:33.225\nif we go to details and\ni scroll down here.\n\n569\n00:29:33.225 --> 00:29:37.625\nAnd I took a look at those administrative\ntemplates and that control panel.\n\n570\n00:29:37.625 --> 00:29:40.514\nAnd all of a sudden Ronnie,\nif he was in that other OU,\n\n571\n00:29:40.514 --> 00:29:45.028\nhe would have a 1,200 second screen\nsaver timeout instead of 600 seconds.\n\n572\n00:29:45.028 --> 00:29:46.769\nSo that's what that modeling is for.\n\n573\n00:29:46.769 --> 00:29:50.960\nThat group policy modeling wizard\nallows me to do those what if analysis.\n\n574\n00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.115\nSo that I can see what would happen\nif these computers were in this OU.\n\n575\n00:29:55.115 --> 00:29:58.505\nOr if this user belong to this group,\nwhat would that change?\n\n576\n00:29:58.505 --> 00:30:01.325\nAnd if it gives me the results I want,\nthen I can go and\n\n577\n00:30:01.325 --> 00:30:03.795\nactually make that change\nin active directory.\n\n578\n00:30:03.795 --> 00:30:06.948\nBut this allows me to do all that testing\nwithout actually having to mess with\n\n579\n00:30:06.948 --> 00:30:10.115\nthe production environment and\nmoving things around in active directory.\n\n580\n00:30:10.115 --> 00:30:11.543\nSo, it's a fantastic little wizard.\n\n581\n00:30:11.543 --> 00:30:13.353\nSame thing, you can rerun that.\n\n582\n00:30:13.353 --> 00:30:14.634\nYou can make changes and\n\n583\n00:30:14.634 --> 00:30:18.681\ntry to rerun the query to see if those\nchanges did what you wanted them to do.\n\n584\n00:30:18.681 --> 00:30:19.995\nSo.\n\n585\n00:30:19.995 --> 00:30:20.539\nYou know?\n\n586\n00:30:20.539 --> 00:30:21.205\nMicrosoft or\n\n587\n00:30:21.205 --> 00:30:25.025\nWindows gives us great tools that we\ncan use to troubleshoot group policy.\n\n588\n00:30:25.025 --> 00:30:27.225\n>> That's great.\nWe had a lot of good information.\n\n589\n00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:29.505\nSo, again, guys,\nwe've talked about troubles,\n\n590\n00:30:29.505 --> 00:30:31.515\neven if it's not troubleshooting.\n\n591\n00:30:31.515 --> 00:30:33.195\nIt might just be verifying the settings.\n\n592\n00:30:33.195 --> 00:30:37.565\nDoing it from the command line on the\nclient, as well as from the server side,\n\n593\n00:30:37.565 --> 00:30:40.345\nif you want the graphical user interface.\n\n594\n00:30:40.345 --> 00:30:41.735\nAlso looking at the what if scenarios.\n\n595\n00:30:41.735 --> 00:30:44.955\nIf you're trying to plan what you\nmight want to implement [INAUDIBLE].\n\n596\n00:30:44.955 --> 00:30:48.534\nIn a production environment before you\nactually put it into the production\n\n597\n00:30:48.534 --> 00:30:51.052\nenvironment, you can use\nsome other tools as well.\n\n598\n00:30:51.052 --> 00:30:53.850\nSo Mike, thanks for that information.\n\n599\n00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:56.590\nYou got any other information\nyou wanna throw in this episode?\n\n600\n00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.065\n>> I don't think so.\n\n601\n00:30:58.065 --> 00:31:01.934\nThe big thing there is to make if you're\nhaving trouble getting some of those to\n\n602\n00:31:01.934 --> 00:31:05.935\nrun, you saw I had to make that exception\nin that Windows firewall to allow that.\n\n603\n00:31:05.935 --> 00:31:11.365\nSo if you're getting that W my error or\nan RPC error check your firewall settings.\n\n604\n00:31:11.365 --> 00:31:14.684\nMake sure you set up your remote\nmanagement on those machines.\n\n605\n00:31:14.684 --> 00:31:18.780\nAnother way you could have done\nthat would have been to run Win RM\n\n606\n00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.264\nquick config on that client machine.\n\n607\n00:31:21.264 --> 00:31:24.864\nOr I could use a group policy,\nwhich is most likely what I would do.\n\n608\n00:31:24.864 --> 00:31:29.262\nI would use that IT Pro Standards, for\nexample, that was linked to the domain.\n\n609\n00:31:29.262 --> 00:31:31.894\nAnd I would go ahead and\nenable those firewall exceptions, so\n\n610\n00:31:31.894 --> 00:31:34.336\nI didn't have to do it to every machine,\nindividually.\n\n611\n00:31:34.336 --> 00:31:37.015\nRemember, that's the power\nof group policy.\n\n612\n00:31:37.015 --> 00:31:39.985\nI can configure all of the machines\non my network, or a subset of,\n\n613\n00:31:39.985 --> 00:31:41.625\nfrom right here in group home.\n\n614\n00:31:41.625 --> 00:31:42.845\n>> Well thanks a lot, Mike.\n\n615\n00:31:42.845 --> 00:31:44.105\nWe've learned a lot today, but\n\n616\n00:31:44.105 --> 00:31:47.705\nit looks like we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna wrap up this episode.\n\n617\n00:31:47.705 --> 00:31:51.535\nFor signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n618\n00:31:51.535 --> 00:31:52.645\n>> And I'm Mike Broderick.\n\n619\n00:31:53.935 --> 00:31:58.665\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n620\n00:31:58.665 --> 00:31:59.850\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

and\n\n3\n00:00:16.352 --> 00:00:20.335\nin todays episode we're gonna be moving\nalong in working with group policy.\n\n4\n00:00:20.335 --> 00:00:23.447\nNow, up until this point we've talked\na lot about some of the different settings\n\n5\n00:00:23.447 --> 00:00:25.276\nthat you can see,\nsome of the configurations,\n\n6\n00:00:25.276 --> 00:00:27.680\nsome of the complications behind\nconfiguring group policy.\n\n7\n00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.010\nWhat happens inside of group policy if\nsomebody makes some configuration changes,\n\n8\n00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.450\nmaybe some changes that you don't\nknow how to undo, if you will?\n\n9\n00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.629\nWell that's one of the things we're\ngonna discuss in this episode.\n\n10\n00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.393\nWe're gonna talk about\nmaintaining group policy, and\n\n11\n00:00:41.393 --> 00:00:44.360\nback with us to do that is none\nother than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.402\nHow are you doing today Mike?\n\n13\n00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:46.509\n>> Doing great, Wes.\n\n14\n00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:50.980\nAnd you're right, we've gotta make sure\nwe're protecting those GPOs, right?\n\n15\n00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.420\nNow, we're gonna back up our server,\nof course.\n\n16\n00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.710\nWe probably do that every night.\n\n17\n00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.746\nWe've got scheduled maintenance\nthat's gonna take care of that,\n\n18\n00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:03.134\nbut I don't wanna have to restore\nan entire domain controller if I'm just\n\n19\n00:01:03.134 --> 00:01:07.345\nmissing a GPO or a GPOs been modified and\nI wanna be able to roll it back.\n\n20\n00:01:07.345 --> 00:01:10.941\nWe can backup the GPOs themselves\nwithin Active Directory,\n\n21\n00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:12.996\nmakes it a lot easier to work with.\n\n22\n00:01:12.996 --> 00:01:17.676\nIt's like previous versions of files,\nwe could go back to a System Restore or\n\n23\n00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:21.636\nwe can get the backup tapes back out,\ntry to restore it that way but\n\n24\n00:01:21.636 --> 00:01:25.300\nif not necessary,\nthat's a lot more work than I need to do.\n\n25\n00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.645\nSo, let's take a look at how group\npolicy allows us to backup and\n\n26\n00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:33.589\nrestore those GPOs,\nas well as make copies of these GPOs,\n\n27\n00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:36.100\nwhich can be a handy feature as well.\n\n28\n00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.707\nSo let's take a look here on my screen,\nand\n\n29\n00:01:37.707 --> 00:01:40.040\nI've got my group policy\nmanagement console opened up.\n\n30\n00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.200\nThe first thing I'm gonna do,\nis I'm gonna simply make a folder.\n\n31\n00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.340\nI need somewhere to store these backups.\n\n32\n00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.760\nSo, I'm gonna right-click over here, and\n\n33\n00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.610\nI probably don't have to tell you\nguys how to make a new folder.\n\n34\n00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.334\nSo I'll make a new folder and\nI'll call it GPO Backups.\n\n35\n00:01:56.941 --> 00:02:01.741\nAnd, I'm gonna have to fix that,\nbecause I can't look at that and go,\n\n36\n00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:03.984\nlet's fix that spelling there.\n\n37\n00:02:03.984 --> 00:02:05.200\nA little too OCD for that.\n\n38\n00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.380\nAll right, so now I've got my little\nfolder there to store my backups in.\n\n39\n00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.876\nThen I need to actually make a backup,\nand as Wes pointed out,\n\n40\n00:02:12.876 --> 00:02:14.365\nthese backups are handy.\n\n41\n00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:17.994\nLet's say that I'm thinking about\nmaking some changes to this GPO, or\n\n42\n00:02:17.994 --> 00:02:20.170\nI am gonna make some changes to the GPO,\nand\n\n43\n00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.468\nI wanna have an easy way to undo\nthose changes if necessary.\n\n44\n00:02:23.468 --> 00:02:29.435\nWell, I can go in and I could simply take\nthat GPO that I'm getting ready to change,\n\n45\n00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:32.230\nright-click on it, and choose Back Up.\n\n46\n00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.910\nI can tell it where I\nwanna back that up to,\n\n47\n00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.500\nand I'll find that\nfolder that I just made.\n\n48\n00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.363\nSo C:GPO Backups and I'll click Back Up,\n\n49\n00:02:42.363 --> 00:02:48.706\nI could put a description in there,\nBefore change, or what have you.\n\n50\n00:02:48.706 --> 00:02:53.299\nAnd it'll backup that one GPO.\n\n51\n00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.346\nAnd I'll go ahead and click OK.\n\n52\n00:02:55.346 --> 00:02:58.123\nThen I could make my changes to that GPO,\nand\n\n53\n00:02:58.123 --> 00:03:01.520\nif I need to I could restore\nit from that backup.\n\n54\n00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.370\nAnd we'll see how to do\nthat here in just a second.\n\n55\n00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.732\nSo really easy to backup an individual\nGPO before you make major changes to it,\n\n56\n00:03:09.732 --> 00:03:13.724\nmakes it easy to roll back in\ntime to before those changes.\n\n57\n00:03:13.724 --> 00:03:18.215\nBut there's another way we can back them\nup, and I can back them up all at once.\n\n58\n00:03:18.215 --> 00:03:21.922\nAnd this is probably something\nwhereas backing up the individual GPO,\n\n59\n00:03:21.922 --> 00:03:25.766\nI usually do that like I said, right\nbefore I'm gonna make a change to it.\n\n60\n00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:30.375\nBut on a regular basis, I really\nwanna back up all of my GPO's, right.\n\n61\n00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:35.080\nAnd, instead of having to do them one at\na time, I can right click on group policy\n\n62\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.660\nobjects itself, the actual node,\nand choose, Back Up All.\n\n63\n00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.740\nAnd give it a location, you can give it\na description, and you can click Back Up,\n\n64\n00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.000\nand you'll see it goes through and\nit backs up all of those GPOs.\n\n65\n00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.460\nNow there's some PowerShell\nscripts you can write as well.\n\n66\n00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.987\nThere's commands for doing this if\nyou wanted to automate that process,\n\n67\n00:03:54.987 --> 00:03:57.380\ncuz I'm probably not going\nto remember to come in and\n\n68\n00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.510\nback those guys up everyday or\nonce a week, or what have you.\n\n69\n00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.593\nSo, easy enough to back them up,\nright-click > Back Up.\n\n70\n00:04:05.593 --> 00:04:10.507\nYou can do it on individual GPO,\nyou can do it on the entire GPO container,\n\n71\n00:04:10.507 --> 00:04:12.025\nto back all of them up.\n\n72\n00:04:12.025 --> 00:04:16.036\nNow, if we go look at that folder,\ninside that GPO backups,\n\n73\n00:04:16.036 --> 00:04:20.613\nI see it doesn't use the nice\nfriendly name, it's using that GUID.\n\n74\n00:04:20.613 --> 00:04:25.515\nSo there are all of my backups, but\nI don't know which one that is and\n\n75\n00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:30.860\nI'm not gonna bother trying to figure\nout which GUID I need to restore.\n\n76\n00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.190\nThis isn't where you go and\nmanage them and restore them from.\n\n77\n00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.334\nWhat you do is you right-click over\nhere and you choose Manage Backups, and\n\n78\n00:04:39.334 --> 00:04:42.703\nthat's gonna open up this little\nmanage backups dialog box,\n\n79\n00:04:42.703 --> 00:04:44.724\nyou can tell it where you wanna look.\n\n80\n00:04:44.724 --> 00:04:47.191\nMaybe you've stored backups\nin different locations.\n\n81\n00:04:47.191 --> 00:04:51.744\nBut there is my folder GPO backups and\nhere's all the backups that I've created.\n\n82\n00:04:51.744 --> 00:04:54.296\nAnd you know what, for giggles,\nlet's make another one.\n\n83\n00:04:54.296 --> 00:04:58.485\nLet's just go ahead and\nright-click > Back Up All and\n\n84\n00:04:58.485 --> 00:05:03.504\nwe'll click Back Up, and\nthen I'll backup this individually.\n\n85\n00:05:03.504 --> 00:05:06.178\nI'll do a backup in that same location,\n\n86\n00:05:06.178 --> 00:05:09.177\njust to give us a little\nbit more to play with.\n\n87\n00:05:09.177 --> 00:05:13.032\nAnd then I'll go back over here,\nright-click and Manage Backups.\n\n88\n00:05:13.032 --> 00:05:15.493\nNow we're talking,\nnow we got a bunch of GPOs in here.\n\n89\n00:05:15.493 --> 00:05:20.159\nAnd to restore a GPO,\nfirst of all, let me start again,\n\n90\n00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.948\nthis is obviously where\nwe manage them from.\n\n91\n00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:25.713\nAnd a couple cool things\nabout this dialog.\n\n92\n00:05:25.713 --> 00:05:29.056\nNoticed I'm gonna see multiple versions,\nright.\n\n93\n00:05:29.056 --> 00:05:33.749\nIf I sort this by name, I'll see\nseveral backups of this block reg edit.\n\n94\n00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:38.324\nCouple backups of these guys,\nIT Pro standards, because I backed up all\n\n95\n00:05:38.324 --> 00:05:43.124\nthe GPO's twice, but I also backed up\nIT Pro Standards individually once,\n\n96\n00:05:43.124 --> 00:05:45.310\nthe same thing with that reg edit.\n\n97\n00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.500\nSo, you can look at the timestamp, right.\n\n98\n00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.530\nAnd as you can see in fact,\n\n99\n00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.710\nI can sort it by timestamp as well,\nbut if we sort it by name,\n\n100\n00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.890\nI can see the three different timestamps\non those three different backups.\n\n101\n00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.332\nNow in the real world they're not\ngonna be seconds a part, right?\n\n102\n00:05:59.332 --> 00:06:03.374\nIt'd be a little easier to see when\nthose different versions were created.\n\n103\n00:06:03.374 --> 00:06:06.586\n>> You know one of the things I was\nthinking, Mike, and help me here, on this.\n\n104\n00:06:06.586 --> 00:06:10.404\nThis might be something good, where let's\nsay you're the senior administrator,\n\n105\n00:06:10.404 --> 00:06:12.393\nright, and you've done some delegation,\n\n106\n00:06:12.393 --> 00:06:15.242\nmaybe to some new junior\nadministrators that have come up, and\n\n107\n00:06:15.242 --> 00:06:18.390\nyou've delegated the ability to\nmaybe make some changes here.\n\n108\n00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.758\nAnd maybe they make a change\nthat you maybe didn't want,\n\n109\n00:06:21.758 --> 00:06:25.968\nmaybe the really junior administrators\nthat maybe you could restore or\n\n110\n00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:29.984\nundo any of those changes that\nmaybe they didn't configure right.\n\n111\n00:06:29.984 --> 00:06:31.407\n>> That's exactly right, Wes.\n\n112\n00:06:31.407 --> 00:06:34.942\nUsing this, I can come in here,\nmaybe I've got a ballpark idea of\n\n113\n00:06:34.942 --> 00:06:38.222\nwhen that administrator made\nthat change that I wanna undo,\n\n114\n00:06:38.222 --> 00:06:40.370\nI can look at my different timestamps.\n\n115\n00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.050\nAnd another cool capability in here,\nI think I know which one I wanna restore,\n\n116\n00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.938\nbut I'm not sure.\n\n117\n00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:47.265\nWhich one was before that change was made?\n\n118\n00:06:47.265 --> 00:06:51.210\nWell, you can actually select that\nversion you think is the one you want and\n\n119\n00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:57.330\nyou can click view settings and it'll\nopen up your report in Internet Explorer,\n\n120\n00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.430\njust like we did if we were\nclicking on the details or\n\n121\n00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.150\nthe settings tab in the group\npolicy management console.\n\n122\n00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.670\nAnd I can scroll through here and\n\n123\n00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.720\nsee what settings were configured\nin that back up of that policy.\n\n124\n00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.733\nAnd if that's not the one I want\nto restore, then I can close that,\n\n125\n00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:16.963\ncome back here and check this one,\nand View Settings and go, yeah,\n\n126\n00:07:16.963 --> 00:07:19.490\nthat's the one I wanna restore, right?\n\n127\n00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.869\nAnd when you go to restore these,\nyou can simply select that GPO and\n\n128\n00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:30.980\nclick Restore and OK, and it will\nrestore that policy, it's that easy.\n\n129\n00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.360\nIt's just gonna overwrite that\n\n130\n00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.570\ncurrent version with the one\nthat you just restored.\n\n131\n00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.190\nAnother cool concept or\n\n132\n00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.320\nfeature within this console is the builder\ndepth to filter this out a little bit.\n\n133\n00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.910\nBecause over time if I'm\nbacking these up every day,\n\n134\n00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.860\nI'm gonna have a big old\nlong list of of GPOs.\n\n135\n00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.980\nThere's gonna be several versions\nof each one of these policies.\n\n136\n00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.740\nWell I want the latest version.\n\n137\n00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.690\nI can choose show only the latest\nversion of each DPM, and\n\n138\n00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.120\nnow I can see the last time stamp.\n\n139\n00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:05.690\nIt's only gonna show me one backup of each\npolicy, whatever the last backup was.\n\n140\n00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.471\nSomebody deletes a policy, well,\nI want that policy back and\n\n141\n00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:13.485\nI want the last backup that we had,\nthe most recent version of it.\n\n142\n00:08:13.485 --> 00:08:17.010\nThis makes it very easy to come\nin here and find that, and\n\n143\n00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:21.980\nthen I just select it and Restore and\nOK, and it's gonna restore that backup.\n\n144\n00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.020\nSo, really pretty easy to work with\nbacking up and restoring the GPOs,\n\n145\n00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.320\nyou can back up the individual GPO,\nyou can back up all the GPOs.\n\n146\n00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.490\nWhen it comes time to restore, you simply\nright-click > Manage Back Ups, and\n\n147\n00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.500\nyou'll see a list of all\nthe backups that you have.\n\n148\n00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.620\nYou can pick the one you think you want,\nyou click View Settings and\n\n149\n00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:48.070\nyou can verify that it's the one you want,\nand then you can choose Restore.\n\n150\n00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.330\nAnd you can select multiples in here but\n\n151\n00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.740\nit won't let you restore multiple\nat one time, unfortunately.\n\n152\n00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.650\nYou see how my Restore button\nhas grayed out down there.\n\n153\n00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.950\nSo it's a one at a time thing,\nI'm not sure why Microsoft did that.\n\n154\n00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:06.930\nCuz you would think it would be a pretty\nconvenient feature to go and choose,\n\n155\n00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:11.000\nShow the latest version,\nselect all of those and then restore them.\n\n156\n00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.890\nBut you see I can't right-click on them\nand I can't use that Restore button.\n\n157\n00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.780\nSo something to keep in mind,\nit is a one at a time process.\n\n158\n00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:22.244\nMaybe they figure if you're restoring all\nof them you're probably better restoring\n\n159\n00:09:22.244 --> 00:09:24.786\nthe entire domain controller but\nI don't know,\n\n160\n00:09:24.786 --> 00:09:27.149\nI kinda thought that\nwould be a good feature.\n\n161\n00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:30.267\nThe next version of Windows,\nwell we'll send them that comment and\n\n162\n00:09:30.267 --> 00:09:34.080\nwe'll see if we can't make that into the\nway of the next server operating system.\n\n163\n00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:39.120\nAll right, so backing up and restoring\nGPOs again, pretty straight forward there,\n\n164\n00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:45.490\nthe last thing that we really\nwanna talk about is copying GPOs.\n\n165\n00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:46.400\nWe can copy them.\n\n166\n00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.570\nAnd, why do we want to copy them?\n\n167\n00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.724\nMaybe you want to try that\nGPO out somewhere else.\n\n168\n00:09:52.724 --> 00:09:55.087\nOr you wanna make some\nchanges to that GPO, but\n\n169\n00:09:55.087 --> 00:09:59.390\nyou don't want to mess up the original\nversion, right, you wanna do some testing,\n\n170\n00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:03.109\nbut not affect the actual GPO that's\nin place in your active directory.\n\n171\n00:10:03.109 --> 00:10:07.311\nSo, I can come over here, and I can\nselect a GPO, or right-click on it, and\n\n172\n00:10:07.311 --> 00:10:08.380\nI can choose Copy.\n\n173\n00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:14.260\nAnd then I can right-click on that\nGroup Policy Objects container and\n\n174\n00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.380\nI can choose Paste.\n\n175\n00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.250\nAnd I'll leave the permissions or\npreserve the existing permissions.\n\n176\n00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.470\nRemember the axis control list\nthat's associated with it.\n\n177\n00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.180\nDid you do any security filtering or\nanything like that?\n\n178\n00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.150\nDo you want to keep those?\n\n179\n00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.480\nIf you preserve it,\nyou'll have an exact copy of it,\n\n180\n00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.700\nor it could use just the default\npermissions for a new GPO.\n\n181\n00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:38.010\nYou click OK, and OK, and now I\nshould have a copy of block reg edit.\n\n182\n00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:42.731\nWhich now I'm free to modify, edit,\nwithout messing up that original policy.\n\n183\n00:10:42.731 --> 00:10:45.711\nMaybe I want to make some changes to it,\nlink it somewhere else.\n\n184\n00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:50.740\nMaybe I wanna link it to a test OU or\nsomething like that.\n\n185\n00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.430\nSo if you need a copy of a GPO,\neasy enough.\n\n186\n00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.881\nAnother cool thing is you can actually,\nhere,\n\n187\n00:10:55.881 --> 00:10:58.221\nI'm just pasting it\nwithin the same domain.\n\n188\n00:10:58.221 --> 00:11:02.091\nIf you have more than one domain,\nyou can take a GPO and\n\n189\n00:11:02.091 --> 00:11:07.434\nyou can move it from one domain to\nanother, it's simply a copy and paste.\n\n190\n00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:11.944\nWhat you would do is change\nthe focus of your snap-in up here,\n\n191\n00:11:11.944 --> 00:11:16.888\nI could show domains and if I had\nmore than one domain in my enterprise\n\n192\n00:11:16.888 --> 00:11:19.430\nI could select that other domain.\n\n193\n00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.271\nSo I would copy it, just like I did.\n\n194\n00:11:21.271 --> 00:11:26.090\nI right-click Copy, and\nthen I would change\n\n195\n00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.640\ndomains by doing Show Domains,\npicking the different domain, and\n\n196\n00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.790\nthen just right clicking and\npasting in that new domain.\n\n197\n00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:38.130\nSo easy to move these, and\nthat is a common thing.\n\n198\n00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:42.745\nWe'll have a test domain setup, and that's\nwhere we do all of our testing of our GPOs\n\n199\n00:11:42.745 --> 00:11:45.616\nbefore we move them in\nthe production environment.\n\n200\n00:11:45.616 --> 00:11:49.221\nSo I makes several GPO's and each of\nthem has dozens of settings in there,\n\n201\n00:11:49.221 --> 00:11:52.141\nnow it's time to move them to\nthe production environment.\n\n202\n00:11:52.141 --> 00:11:54.673\nI don't want to have to\nrecreate those policies,\n\n203\n00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:56.854\nI want the ones that I've tested, right?\n\n204\n00:11:56.854 --> 00:12:01.021\nCuz if I recreate them, I might miss\na setting or add a setting, and\n\n205\n00:12:01.021 --> 00:12:02.815\nwhy would I do that, right?\n\n206\n00:12:02.815 --> 00:12:07.327\nI've already tested, these are known,\ngood working GPO's, so copy them.\n\n207\n00:12:07.327 --> 00:12:11.697\nThat way you know you've got the tested\nversion of the GPO, and then paste it into\n\n208\n00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:15.627\nyour production environment and\nthen link it to the appropriate OU's.\n\n209\n00:12:15.627 --> 00:12:18.957\nNow there is something that we've gotta\nkeep in mind when we start moving these\n\n210\n00:12:18.957 --> 00:12:19.667\nGPO's around.\n\n211\n00:12:19.667 --> 00:12:23.726\nIf we're moving them from one\ndomain to another, inside the GPO,\n\n212\n00:12:23.726 --> 00:12:26.714\nthere can be some relative references,\nright.\n\n213\n00:12:26.714 --> 00:12:31.708\nLet's say we've got some, I don't know,\nlog on scripts, and we're telling it where\n\n214\n00:12:31.708 --> 00:12:36.116\nthose log on scripts are located,\nif we're not storing them within the GPO.\n\n215\n00:12:36.116 --> 00:12:40.637\nOr software installation, you've gotta\npoint it to the shared folder where\n\n216\n00:12:40.637 --> 00:12:44.810\nthat software is located so\nthat when that policy applies to machines,\n\n217\n00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:47.540\nthey can reach out and\ninstall that software.\n\n218\n00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:51.799\nWell in my test domain,\nthat software installation or\n\n219\n00:12:51.799 --> 00:12:57.272\nthose software installation\nfiles are on \\\\file01\\software.\n\n220\n00:12:57.272 --> 00:13:01.011\nBut in my production environment,\nit's a different UNC path,\n\n221\n00:13:01.011 --> 00:13:03.870\nright, it's \\\\server14\\sourcefiles.\n\n222\n00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:09.568\nSo if I copy that GPO over from my\ntest domain to my production domain,\n\n223\n00:13:09.568 --> 00:13:12.811\nthe UNC path is now gonna fail, right,\n\n224\n00:13:12.811 --> 00:13:16.767\nbecause there is no\nfile01 in my production.\n\n225\n00:13:16.767 --> 00:13:18.295\nSame thing with like, group references.\n\n226\n00:13:18.295 --> 00:13:24.850\nLet's say we're doing a restricted groups\nand in our test domain, test domain,\n\n227\n00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:30.552\nreally should mimic your production\nenvironment as best as possible.\n\n228\n00:13:30.552 --> 00:13:33.680\nBut let's say I've got a parent domain,\nand I've done restricted groups in there.\n\n229\n00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.943\nAnd now we've got a new child domain and\nwe want to use that same policy, but\n\n230\n00:13:37.943 --> 00:13:42.562\nthey have a little bit different naming\nconvention for their groups down there.\n\n231\n00:13:42.562 --> 00:13:44.959\nSo, when that policy gets\npasted on another domain,\n\n232\n00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:47.338\nall of a sudden that group\nreference fails, right.\n\n233\n00:13:47.338 --> 00:13:52.105\nI don't wanna have to go in and do that\nmanually, think about all the places that\n\n234\n00:13:52.105 --> 00:13:55.681\nthere's any relative references,\nand we don't have to.\n\n235\n00:13:55.681 --> 00:14:00.784\nGroup policy gives us something\ncalled the migration table,\n\n236\n00:14:00.784 --> 00:14:06.778\nand it finds all those relative\nreferences and allows me to update them.\n\n237\n00:14:06.778 --> 00:14:10.733\nFor example, I've got a policy here\nthat I created called Restricted Groups.\n\n238\n00:14:10.733 --> 00:14:15.375\nAnd if we take a look at the settings,\nI'll expand this out.\n\n239\n00:14:15.375 --> 00:14:20.098\nAnd I wanna add the GNV hosts and\nthe GNV developers to\n\n240\n00:14:20.098 --> 00:14:25.796\nthe built-in administrators\ngroup on all of those machines.\n\n241\n00:14:25.796 --> 00:14:30.845\nBut in that domain, I wanna paste it into,\nlet's say they didn't have\n\n242\n00:14:30.845 --> 00:14:35.738\na group called GNV hosts,\nthey were just called hosts or show hosts.\n\n243\n00:14:35.738 --> 00:14:38.727\nWell now all of a sudden,\nthis policy wouldn't work in that domain.\n\n244\n00:14:38.727 --> 00:14:40.035\nHow do we fix it?\n\n245\n00:14:40.035 --> 00:14:41.550\nWe create migration tables.\n\n246\n00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:45.208\nSo there's a couple of ways you can\nlaunch the migration table editor.\n\n247\n00:14:45.208 --> 00:14:47.921\nYou can right-click on\nGroup Policy Objects and\n\n248\n00:14:47.921 --> 00:14:50.039\nchoose Open Migration Table Editor,\n\n249\n00:14:50.039 --> 00:14:53.362\nyou could right-click up here\non Domains and choose that.\n\n250\n00:14:53.362 --> 00:14:57.540\nYou can even right click\non a particular GPO.\n\n251\n00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.265\nAnd I lied to you, you can't do it there.\n\n252\n00:15:00.265 --> 00:15:04.689\n[LAUGH] All right, so if I open that\ntable up, I'm gonna right click,\n\n253\n00:15:04.689 --> 00:15:08.650\nOpen Migration Table Editor,\nand it starts out blank.\n\n254\n00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:14.796\nAnd I could just write it in myself,\nI can say gnv-hosts,\n\n255\n00:15:14.796 --> 00:15:20.065\nSource Type is a group, so\nDomain Global Group and\n\n256\n00:15:20.065 --> 00:15:26.228\nin the Destination,\nit's actually known as Showhosts.\n\n257\n00:15:26.228 --> 00:15:29.673\nSo now, when I go to import that policy or\npaste that policy in,\n\n258\n00:15:29.673 --> 00:15:33.965\nit can open up this table, and it can\nautomatically map anywhere it sees this,\n\n259\n00:15:33.965 --> 00:15:35.610\nit will replace it with this.\n\n260\n00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:41.500\nAnother way you can populate this table\nis to import it from the GPO itself.\n\n261\n00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:46.120\nI can choose populate from GPO, and\n\n262\n00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.282\nI can pick that GPO and click OK.\n\n263\n00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:53.460\nAnd there I can see it found\nsome relative references.\n\n264\n00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.840\nAnd there are some groups, and\n\n265\n00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:00.370\nI've got to tell it what that's gonna\nbe called in the destination domain.\n\n266\n00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:05.705\nAgain, just a chance to map out any\nrelative paths that are gonna cause\n\n267\n00:16:05.705 --> 00:16:10.603\nthat policy to fail,\nonce you paste it into a different domain.\n\n268\n00:16:10.603 --> 00:16:14.899\nAnd you can save this migration table, and\n\n269\n00:16:14.899 --> 00:16:21.234\nI'll just dump it in my documents and\nI'll call it newdomain.\n\n270\n00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.908\nSo when we paste this into a new domain,\nthis is the table I want to use.\n\n271\n00:16:26.908 --> 00:16:31.209\nAnd then again like I said,\nwhen we go to paste that policy in there,\n\n272\n00:16:31.209 --> 00:16:34.307\nI don't know if I can show you here,\nlet's see.\n\n273\n00:16:34.307 --> 00:16:37.413\nLet's paste, and\nit should paste that in but\n\n274\n00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:41.590\nit didn't actually ask me\nbecause not switching domains.\n\n275\n00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:44.460\nBut if I want pasting it into\na different domain it would say,\n\n276\n00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.050\nwhere is the migration table,\nand I would just browse and\n\n277\n00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.420\nfind that migration table,\nopen it up and use that.\n\n278\n00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:56.390\nSo the cool thing about that migration\ntable is that it's separate from the GPO\n\n279\n00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:01.110\nso I can reuse that table, I only have to\ncreate one that just includes all the maps\n\n280\n00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:04.720\nfrom the parent domain to the child\ndomain, or from the test domain to\n\n281\n00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.160\nthe production domain and just use that\nsame migration table over and over.\n\n282\n00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:13.060\nYou also might have noticed\nthat when I open that editor,\n\n283\n00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:18.470\nand I imported that from the GPO,\nanother option was During scan,\n\n284\n00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.150\ninclude security principles from the DACL,\nright.\n\n285\n00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.440\nIf we had done some security filtering,\n\n286\n00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.880\nwhere I added groups to that access\ncontrol list to deny them read or\n\n287\n00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.370\napply group policy, I could include\nthat as well in that table.\n\n288\n00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:34.580\nSo you'll see that particular\npolicy doesn't have any,\n\n289\n00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.390\nbut it would find those as as well.\n\n290\n00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.370\nSo cool capability, easy to move\nthese policies from one domain to\n\n291\n00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:45.470\nanother simply by copying and pasting and\nif there's any relative references it's\n\n292\n00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.840\ngonna find them for me and\nallow me to fix them.\n\n293\n00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.620\n>> That's awesome.\n\n294\n00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:49.750\nSo a lot of good information.\n\n295\n00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:53.980\nRemember, any time we talk about important\nsettings we talk about maintenance, right.\n\n296\n00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:57.100\nAnd some people might lose sight of\nthe fact that important settings,\n\n297\n00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.960\npart of just daily maintenance,\nis making sure that you have backups.\n\n298\n00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.170\nWell, group policy,\nit's gonna be no different.\n\n299\n00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:06.047\nSo maintenance, remember,\nis having those valid copies backed up, so\n\n300\n00:18:06.047 --> 00:18:10.365\njust in case you run into a situation or\nscenario where you might need to use them,\n\n301\n00:18:10.365 --> 00:18:11.634\nyou can restore them and\n\n302\n00:18:11.634 --> 00:18:15.089\nyour production environment\ndoesn't fail at any point there.\n\n303\n00:18:15.089 --> 00:18:17.242\nSo Mike, great information today.\n\n304\n00:18:17.242 --> 00:18:21.010\nAnything else that you might\nwanna depart with here?\n\n305\n00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.660\n>> I would say, mainly,\njust make sure you're doing the backups.\n\n306\n00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:28.510\nIf you're getting ready to make a change\nto a policy don't forget to back it up\n\n307\n00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.880\nfirst if you think you might\nwant to undo that setting and\n\n308\n00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.360\nthat way you can quickly and\neasily just roll back.\n\n309\n00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.600\nDo a scheduled task, right,\nget your PowerShell commands,\n\n310\n00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:43.400\nremember you can do\na Get-Command-Module group policy and\n\n311\n00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:48.310\nyou'll see in there that there's commands\nthat allow you to backup your GPO's.\n\n312\n00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.420\nCreate a scheduled task\nthat runs that script so\n\n313\n00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.090\nthat you're backing them up,\nwhatever you're company decides.\n\n314\n00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.710\nOnce a week, once a day,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n315\n00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.820\nSo that in the event somebody deletes\na policy or a policy gets corrupt or\n\n316\n00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:05.540\nsomething like that, I know that I've\ngot a back up and I can restore it.\n\n317\n00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.860\n>> There we go, maintaining consistency in\nthe production environment doesn't fail.\n\n318\n00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:12.375\nWell it looks like we're coming to\nthe end of another great

00:00:16.362\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:19.700\ntoday we're gonna be taking a look\nat working with group policy.\n\n5\n00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.510\nSpecifically talking about account\nas well as password policies, and\n\n6\n00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.850\nwho better to help us than\nMister Mike Rodrick, and\n\n7\n00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.530\nMike, you're gonna actually help us\nbecause we need to actually understand\n\n8\n00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.190\nthe real world context that we would\nneed to use these policies in.\n\n9\n00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.970\n>> That's the idea, Ronnie, you know\nwe've spent a lot of time talking about\n\n10\n00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.970\nhow group policy works, how we\nimplement it, the engine behind it, and\n\n11\n00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.890\nthings like that, and now what I'd like to\ndo is spend the next few episodes really\n\n12\n00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.980\ngoing over some real world application,\n\n13\n00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.470\nwhere we see, where we actually use\ngroup policy in enterprise environment.\n\n14\n00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.000\nSome of the examples of some\nof the more common things\n\n15\n00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.040\nthat we do with group policy, and\nI thought a good place to start would be\n\n16\n00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.130\nthose password policies which are really\npart of our account policies, so\n\n17\n00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.690\nthat's what we're gonna do\nin this particular episode.\n\n18\n00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.770\nSo the first thing we'll do,\nwe'll just dive right on into it.\n\n19\n00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.140\nWe'll just open up our group policy\nmanagement console, and we need to figure\n\n20\n00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.730\nout, one, where these settings are, and\nagain, we've done a lot of work with group\n\n21\n00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.215\npolicy and we know that each policy has,\nas we create new policies,\n\n22\n00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:22.475\nthere's four thousand some plus settings\nin there, and we can create a setting, and\n\n23\n00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:26.075\nwe can ascope it to an OU or\ntheir domain, or what have you.\n\n24\n00:01:27.265 --> 00:01:30.832\nSo if I want that setting to apply to just\nthe people in the sales department or\n\n25\n00:01:30.832 --> 00:01:32.402\nthe sales OU, or\n\n26\n00:01:32.402 --> 00:01:36.902\njust the people or the computers in\nthe marketing OU, we can do that.\n\n27\n00:01:36.902 --> 00:01:41.352\nPassword policies and account policies are\ngonna be a little different, all right?\n\n28\n00:01:41.352 --> 00:01:45.812\nWith these guys, there's only one\nplace Active Directory is gonna read\n\n29\n00:01:45.812 --> 00:01:49.682\nthese policies from, and\nthat's at the domain level.\n\n30\n00:01:49.682 --> 00:01:52.420\nWhen we create a password policy or\n\n31\n00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.180\nwe set these account lock out settings,\nwe do it for the entire domain.\n\n32\n00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.160\nYou can take another policy and configure\nthose settings, and link it to an OU\n\n33\n00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.950\ndown within your Active Directory\nstructure, it's gonna get ignored, right?\n\n34\n00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.310\nThe only place that it's\nactually gonna look it, look for\n\n35\n00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.150\nthese settings is at\nthe domain level itself.\n\n36\n00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.080\nSo that's not to say we can't have\ndifferent password settings for\n\n37\n00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.240\ndifferent users.\n\n38\n00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.940\nBut that's done outside of group policy,\nwe will look at in our Active Directory\n\n39\n00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.110\nclasses or some of those videos where we\ntalk about password-setting objects, and\n\n40\n00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.480\nas far as group policy goes, there's one\nplace we're gonna set these password\n\n41\n00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.660\npolicies, and that is at the domain level,\nin fact it's a recommend practice.\n\n42\n00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.900\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nopen up this default domain policy here,\n\n43\n00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.820\nI'll click on my link to remind me, or\n\n44\n00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.680\nmy little message reminding me that\nthis is a link, not the actual GPO.\n\n45\n00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.000\nRemember when we installed\nActive Directory,\n\n46\n00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.840\nwe've get two policies by default,\nwe've got that default domain policy, and\n\n47\n00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.860\nthe default domain controllers policy.\n\n48\n00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.650\nAnd if we look at that\ndefault domain policy,\n\n49\n00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.470\nwe take a look at what\nsettings are in there.\n\n50\n00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.230\nThen I'll go ahead and add this guy to my\ntrusted so we can open up that report.\n\n51\n00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.110\nAnd there's a lot of settings in here,\n\n52\n00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.970\nbut the main settings are going to be my\npassword policies and my account policies.\n\n53\n00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.360\nI can see all of those configured here.\n\n54\n00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.040\nWhat Microsoft will recommend is that if\nwe need to change our password policies,\n\n55\n00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.480\nor our account policies,\nuse the default domain policy.\n\n56\n00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.240\nThat's what that policy was created for,\nto store all of those settings\n\n57\n00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.940\nin relationship or in regards to\nour accounts and our passwords.\n\n58\n00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.140\nIf you want to make any other settings\nthat apply to the entire domain,\n\n59\n00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.600\ncreate separate policies and\nlink them to the domain.\n\n60\n00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.690\nThey really want you to use\nthe default domain policy only for\n\n61\n00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.340\nthe settings that already\nexist in the policy.\n\n62\n00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.070\nSo if you need to change any of these\nsettings, this is the policy to use.\n\n63\n00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.198\nBut if you got other settings that\nyou wanna apply to the entire domain,\n\n64\n00:03:42.198 --> 00:03:43.879\ncreate a separate policy and do that.\n\n65\n00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.962\nMost of the organizations that I've\nworked with, we'll go up to our domain,\n\n66\n00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:53.736\nand we'll create one of the first\nGPOs that we'll create, let's say our\n\n67\n00:03:53.736 --> 00:03:58.910\ncompany's ITProTV, it would be ITProTV\nstandards, or something like that.\n\n68\n00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.913\nSo anything that I want to\napply to the entire domain,\n\n69\n00:04:01.913 --> 00:04:06.100\nthat’s where I’m gonna do it and\nI can create as many as I need to.\n\n70\n00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.220\nBut for my password and\n\n71\n00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.510\naccount settings, those are gonna be\ndone in this default domain policy.\n\n72\n00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.640\nAnd so let’s first look at\nthe default setting here.\n\n73\n00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.090\nAnd this settings tab gives a great\nlittle overview of all those settings.\n\n74\n00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.890\nWe look at our password settings, right?\n\n75\n00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:22.880\nAnd we've got several.\n\n76\n00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.580\nWe've got password history,\nminimum or maximum age,\n\n77\n00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.540\nwe've got our password length,\ncomplexity requirements,\n\n78\n00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.620\nas well as storing passwords\nusing reversible encryption.\n\n79\n00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.100\nAnd the defaults, this is what I've\ngot here, I haven't changed anything,\n\n80\n00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.970\nthis is the default for Sever 2012 R2.\n\n81\n00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.700\nEnforce password history\nis 24 passwords remembered.\n\n82\n00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.520\nNow what that setting is gonna do, that\nmeans Active Directory is gonna remember\n\n83\n00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.700\nthe passwords that\nyou've used in the past.\n\n84\n00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.960\nSo every time you change your password,\n\n85\n00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.500\nit's remembering your old\npassword because when we want our\n\n86\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.100\nusers to change passwords, we want them to\nchange it to something different, right?\n\n87\n00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.340\nAnd without this setting,\nif your old password was blue42, right?\n\n88\n00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.370\nAnd then it tells you it's\ntime to change your password.\n\n89\n00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.700\nYou could change it from blue42 to blue42,\nright?\n\n90\n00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.130\nAnd that wouldn't be much of a change.\n\n91\n00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.070\nSo in effect, you're not\nactually changing your password.\n\n92\n00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.390\nYou'd go through the motions.\n\n93\n00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.600\nYou'd type in your old password,\nyou'd type in your new password twice, and\n\n94\n00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.000\naccording to Active Directory,\nyou've changed your password, right?\n\n95\n00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.370\nBut we know it's the same exact password.\n\n96\n00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.810\nSo by remembering the passwords\nthat you've already used,\n\n97\n00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.600\nI can prevent my users from using\nthe same password over and over again.\n\n98\n00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.180\nOr the same two or\nthree of their favorite passwords.\n\n99\n00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.120\nThe whole idea is to make sure that\nthey're changing it to something\n\n100\n00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.310\ndifferent.\n\n101\n00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.560\nSo by default it's gonna remember\nthe last 24 passwords you've used.\n\n102\n00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.270\nSo if I've used blue42 for\nmy password and it's time to change it,\n\n103\n00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.190\nI can't use it again for\nthe next 24 password changes, right?\n\n104\n00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.420\nBelow that I've got the minimum and\nmaximum password age.\n\n105\n00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.210\nThese are pretty straightforward.\n\n106\n00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.450\nThe maximum age is how often you\nneed to change your password.\n\n107\n00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.520\nBy default, that's set to 42 days.\n\n108\n00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.080\nThat means that every 42 days,\nyou gonna get a reminder that says,\n\n109\n00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.620\nhey, it's time to change your password and\nyou'll have to change it.\n\n110\n00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.180\nThe minimum password\nage is set to one day,\n\n111\n00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.270\nand this one Ronnie, I think that most\npeople, well why, what does it matter?\n\n112\n00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.230\n>> Right, so when we take a look at\nthis idea the minimum password age,\n\n113\n00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.040\nwhat we're actually telling them is\nhow long they must keep this password.\n\n114\n00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.590\nA lot of times people might ask you, all\nright, you've got 24 passwords set here.\n\n115\n00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.250\nAnd if you actually set this to a zero.\n\n116\n00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.920\nThey can go through and\nchange that password 24 times in a row.\n\n117\n00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.600\nAnd then they can come back and\nreuse that first one again.\n\n118\n00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.040\nBut at least with this with\nthe minimum password age,\n\n119\n00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.110\nit's gonna require them 24 days, right?\n\n120\n00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.917\nBefore they can actually reuse one, so\n\n121\n00:06:48.917 --> 00:06:51.337\nthat they be conscious about\nchanging it every day.\n\n122\n00:06:51.337 --> 00:06:53.129\nI guess there are some people\nthat would do it, but-\n\n123\n00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:54.004\n>> Probably?\n\n124\n00:06:54.004 --> 00:06:58.024\n[LAUGH] But yeah, he's exactly right,\nyou know, that's the problem we have,\n\n125\n00:06:58.024 --> 00:07:00.364\nis that a user wants to\nuse that same password so\n\n126\n00:07:00.364 --> 00:07:02.950\nthey don't have to\nremember a new password.\n\n127\n00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.770\nSo they will spend 15 minutes changing\ntheir password 25 times in a row so\n\n128\n00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.710\nthey can get back to\ntheir favorite password.\n\n129\n00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.130\nWith this one,\nthey gotta wait at least 24 hours.\n\n130\n00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.650\nAnd you can see, with a little bit\nof tweaking on the numbers there,\n\n131\n00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.720\nI can make it to where it's\ngonna be very ineffective.\n\n132\n00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.190\nWhat if I'm remembering\nthe last 30 passwords, and\n\n133\n00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:27.660\nyou have to change your password every\n30 days, and the minimum is one day.\n\n134\n00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.300\nWell now you're gonna have to change\nyour password once every day so\n\n135\n00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.150\nafter 30 changes you'll\nbe back to the original,\n\n136\n00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.080\nbut now it'll be time to change your\npassword again because the 30 days is up.\n\n137\n00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.490\nSo playing with those numbers I can get\nit to where my users can't do that.\n\n138\n00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.820\nSo minimum password age as Ronnie said,\n\n139\n00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.491\none day that means if I change my password\nI can't change it again for 24 hours.\n\n140\n00:07:47.491 --> 00:07:51.199\nMinimum password length is\nset to seven characters, and\n\n141\n00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:53.913\nthis is it should be the minimum, right?\n\n142\n00:07:53.913 --> 00:07:57.100\nIt's not really that long\nin the scheme of things.\n\n143\n00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.421\nYeah, when we start taking a look at\nthe idea of the length of the password,\n\n144\n00:08:00.421 --> 00:08:04.065\nthere's always the conventional wisdom\nthat the longer password is the stronger\n\n145\n00:08:04.065 --> 00:08:04.940\npassword.\n\n146\n00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:09.480\nAnd I think I still believe that,\neven though we take a look and there's so\n\n147\n00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.820\nmany different things that are out there\nthat say, oh no, that's no longer true.\n\n148\n00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.960\nI still have this habit of believing that,\nand so\n\n149\n00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.100\na lot of times, even inside of Active\nDirectory, you see where there's an actual\n\n150\n00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.430\npolicy set up right here That says look,\ncreate longer passwords and\n\n151\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.200\nthey just say this is what requires\nthem to actually have minimum.\n\n152\n00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.650\nIf not, people would make their\npasswords 1234, and oh, my name,\n\n153\n00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.860\nor Mike with a one is what\nwould end up happening.\n\n154\n00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.991\n>> My password would be the letter M.\n\n155\n00:08:36.991 --> 00:08:38.770\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right.\n\n156\n00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.235\n>> Right, but that's not very secure.\n\n157\n00:08:40.235 --> 00:08:41.120\nSo absolutely.\n\n158\n00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.610\nWe think about how passwords are broken,\nit's either through brute force,\n\n159\n00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.170\nlike trying every possible character or\nthrough password guessing,\n\n160\n00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:50.770\ndictionary attacks, things like that.\n\n161\n00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.270\nOr rainbow tables,\ntrying to match hashing algorithms.\n\n162\n00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:59.480\nAnd the longer a password is,\nthe more possibilities there are, right?\n\n163\n00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.570\nIf you think about binary,\n\n164\n00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.360\nif my Password is only one character,\nit's either a zero or a one.\n\n165\n00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.130\nThere's only two possibilities But\n\n166\n00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.410\nif my password is two characters,\nnow I've got four possibilities.\n\n167\n00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:10.890\nZero zero, zero one.\n\n168\n00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.830\nOne zero, and one one.\n\n169\n00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.590\nIf my passwords is three characters\nin binary, now i've got what,\n\n170\n00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.810\ntwo to the third.\n\n171\n00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.700\nThat's eight Possibilities, right?\n\n172\n00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.710\nSo for a bad guy,\nI've got eight different possibilities.\n\n173\n00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.560\nThat's eight guesses I've\ngotta do versus four guesses I\n\n174\n00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.450\nhad to do if it was only\ntwo characters long.\n\n175\n00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:33.570\nThose are obviously very short numbers but\nto get a mental picture of that.\n\n176\n00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.850\nSo you can imagine Seven\ncharacters versus eight or\n\n177\n00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.060\nnine characters, that's a big difference.\n\n178\n00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:45.500\nThe actual formula would be 96 to\nthe seventh versus 96 to the eighth.\n\n179\n00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.390\nAnd, there's a big difference.\n\n180\n00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:52.430\nSo adding one character adds a lot\nof additional possibilities,\n\n181\n00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.400\nwhich means that many more possibilities\nthe bad guy has to go through.\n\n182\n00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.300\nTo guess or break your password.\n\n183\n00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.900\nSo the longer, the stronger.\n\n184\n00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:03.440\nAnd yeah, there's arguments about does\nlength help versus complexity and\n\n185\n00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.170\nthings like that.\n\n186\n00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.000\nAnd I'll tell you.\n\n187\n00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.180\nI believe in both.\n\n188\n00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:06.730\n>> Yep.\n\n189\n00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.130\n>> There's nothing wrong with\nmaking it long and complex.\n\n190\n00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.420\nWe'll talk about complexity\nhere in a second.\n\n191\n00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:17.220\nAll right, so, minimum password length,\nseven is really the default.\n\n192\n00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.260\nEight or nine or\nten would be just as good.\n\n193\n00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.360\nThe thing you've got to keep in mind\nhere is you don't want to go too far\n\n194\n00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.410\nwith your security.\n\n195\n00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.180\nBecause if I think oh, you know what,\n\n196\n00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.580\nI'm going to make my users use a 15\ncharacter password, and they're going to\n\n197\n00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:35.310\nhave to change it every 14 days, that's\ngoing to be a really secure network No.\n\n198\n00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.960\nBecause what's going to happen Ronnie?\n\n199\n00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.740\n>> What normally ends up\nhappening is fairly easy.\n\n200\n00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.470\nIs most people will go ahead and\n\n201\n00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.020\nbypass what you think is\ngoing to be strong security.\n\n202\n00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.710\nBy simply writing it down.\n\n203\n00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:46.990\nAnd not only writing it down but\n\n204\n00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:50.020\nprobably pasting it very\nobviously in a place where you go.\n\n205\n00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.720\nI wonder if that's their password.\n\n206\n00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.800\nBecause they'll have to find it if not\nthen they'll go, I don't know where this\n\n207\n00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.470\npassword's to, so They'll normally\nput it right there is plain sight,\n\n208\n00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:01.610\nso there is this unusual balance\nthat you have to maintain.\n\n209\n00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.820\nAs long as you want your passwords,\nyou can make them that way, but\n\n210\n00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.770\nremember unless your users are actually\nexpecting it, after a while they'll bypass\n\n211\n00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.790\nit in some way, and your security policy,\nit's gonna get violated.\n\n212\n00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:12.600\n>> Exactly right.\n\n213\n00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.330\nSo you go ahead and\nmake them use the 20 character password,\n\n214\n00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:16.281\nthey're just gonna write it down.\n\n215\n00:11:16.281 --> 00:11:16.796\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n216\n00:11:16.796 --> 00:11:18.817\nas Ronnie said,\nthey're gonna tape it to their monitor, or\n\n217\n00:11:18.817 --> 00:11:20.160\nleave it in their desk drawer\n>> Score.\n\n218\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.110\nSo you're really not helping security.\n\n219\n00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.230\nYou're hurting security.\n\n220\n00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.970\nSo you've got to find that balance\npoint there if we're talking about\n\n221\n00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.580\npassword length.\n\n222\n00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.860\nPassword must meet complexity\nrequirements is turned on by default and\n\n223\n00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.840\nwhat this means as far\nas windows is concerned.\n\n224\n00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.500\nThere's four character sets\nI can use in my password.\n\n225\n00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.480\nUpper case letters, lower case letters,\nnumbers, and special characters.\n\n226\n00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.510\nIf I turn on complexity,\nwhich it is by default,\n\n227\n00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:51.210\nthen your password must contain a mix\nof three of the four character sets.\n\n228\n00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.620\nDoesn't matter which three, your pass\nword can be made up of upper case,\n\n229\n00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.410\nlower case, and numbers, or lower case and\nnumbers and special characters.\n\n230\n00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:02.060\nAs long as three of the four character\nsets are in your password and\n\n231\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:07.130\nit meets the length requirements,\nthen your complexity is met, right?\n\n232\n00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.160\nSo, and that's a good thing, right?\n\n233\n00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.790\nThis is the argument people have is,\nis length better than complexity?\n\n234\n00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:17.060\nAnd again, I will tell you both\nbecause length is important.\n\n235\n00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:22.650\nThat's like the number of characters\nIncreases the number of possibilities for\n\n236\n00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:24.020\nthat many characters.\n\n237\n00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.750\nThe complexity increases the number\nof character possibilities\n\n238\n00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.350\nper characters right.\n\n239\n00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:35.680\nIf I'm just using lower case then there's\nonly 26 possibilities per character right.\n\n240\n00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:41.060\nBut if I use upper case and lower case now\nthere's 26,26, there's 52 possibilities.\n\n241\n00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.740\nPer character.\n\n242\n00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.880\nIf I use numbers that adds another ten,\nzero through nine.\n\n243\n00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.750\nSpecial characters there's like 32,\nso when we add it up,\n\n244\n00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:53.100\nit's somewhere around 96 possibilities.\n\n245\n00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:57.270\nSo that means, having a long password\nmeans having a lot of possibilities, but\n\n246\n00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.440\nif there's 96 possibilities per character.\n\n247\n00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.680\nThat's also important,\n\n248\n00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:06.640\nthat where's that formula I've got earlier\nthat I said 96 to the power of 7th, right?\n\n249\n00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.510\nSo that the length is\nthat exponent of value,\n\n250\n00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.980\n96 to the 7th versus 96 to the 8th, right?\n\n251\n00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.140\nSo adding one character\nchanges that exponent but\n\n252\n00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:20.910\nthe complexity sets was that bottom number\nthat 96, if we're only using uppercase and\n\n253\n00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.510\nlowercase that formula changes to.\n\n254\n00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.850\n52 to the seventh or 52 to the eighth.\n\n255\n00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.510\nRight.\nSo you can see you're,\n\n256\n00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:31.210\nby changing complexity you're changing\nthat bottom number in that formula.\n\n257\n00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.540\nBy changing your length you're changing\nyour exponent value in that formula.\n\n258\n00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:38.870\nSo both are gonna go to increasing\nthe total number of possibilities\n\n259\n00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.080\nwhich means my password\nis gonna be stronger.\n\n260\n00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.780\nSo, Mike, when we talk about the idea\nof using a policy like this,\n\n261\n00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.750\nwhat we have to consider is pretty\nmuch well, at least two concepts here.\n\n262\n00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.770\nOne is that it needs to be set.\n\n263\n00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.590\nAnd you actually see where there's\na default policy right there.\n\n264\n00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:54.990\nSo it's already set for us.\n\n265\n00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:57.230\nAnd so you notice that in active\ndirectory they're saying,\n\n266\n00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:01.270\nlook, use a password policy and we're just\ngonna use this default one for right now.\n\n267\n00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:05.880\nSecondly is understanding your own\nsecurity policy and how this complexity\n\n268\n00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.200\nlevel needs to be set and you have to\nmaintain that balance that we need.\n\n269\n00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.900\nAnd you can have both of those in mind,\nyou're gonna end up kind of skewing it\n\n270\n00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.290\none way or the other and\nit's not gonna be effective.\n\n271\n00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.880\nBut even just setting this by itself Mike,\n\n272\n00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.600\nis not enough because if I\nset it exactly like this.\n\n273\n00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.400\nI need to have some other thing that also\nplays in balance with it or a hacker\n\n274\n00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.820\nwould just continue to hack away at\nthis until the point where they're gonna\n\n275\n00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:34.030\nviolate us as some point, especially with\nas fast as computers are getting today.\n\n276\n00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.680\nWe actually need that To add in\nanother component to the policy.\n\n277\n00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.450\n>> We really do, and I don;t know where\nyou're going with that but before we get\n\n278\n00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:41.550\nthere, let's hit that last setting there,\n>> Oh, sorry.\n\n279\n00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.360\n>> Store passwords using\nreversible encryption.\n\n280\n00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.160\nIt's quite alright.\n\n281\n00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.575\nThis is one that we honestly we don't deal\nwith and that's why Ronny just went by it.\n\n282\n00:14:48.575 --> 00:14:50.970\n[LAUGH] Because we typically\ndon't mess with it.\n\n283\n00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.220\nIt's disabled by default.\n\n284\n00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.540\nIt's actually turned off.\n\n285\n00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.060\nTurning this one on Will\nreduce your security.\n\n286\n00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.530\nSo we wanna leave it off.\n\n287\n00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:02.120\nNormally passwords are stored in that\naccount database as a hash value.\n\n288\n00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:07.260\nAnd if we remember anything about hashing,\nhash values, it's a one-way encryption.\n\n289\n00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.860\nSo if somebody steals that hash value or\ngets ahold of the hash value,\n\n290\n00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.770\nthey can't reverse engineer it\nto get your password back out.\n\n291\n00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.350\nIt's a one-way encryption.\n\n292\n00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.590\nThere are some older\nauthentication protocols.\n\n293\n00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:20.490\nThey need a plain text version.\n\n294\n00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:24.100\nThey need to know what your password is,\nnot the encrypted form of your password.\n\n295\n00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.340\nCHAP is one of them, challenge\nhandshake authentication protocol.\n\n296\n00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.020\nSo if I wanted to use that\nin my Windows environment,\n\n297\n00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.960\nI would need to turn on\nreversible encryption, so\n\n298\n00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.775\nthat when needed, active directory could\nreverse my encryption on my stored\n\n299\n00:15:37.775 --> 00:15:41.940\npassword.to get the plain text back\nout To work with CHAP, all right.\n\n300\n00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.140\nNo, we're not gonna go into how\nCHAP works, it's another episode.\n\n301\n00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:49.546\nBut just understand that there might be\ntimes when you need to turn that on, but\n\n302\n00:15:49.546 --> 00:15:51.306\nif you do, you're reducing security.\n\n303\n00:15:51.306 --> 00:15:54.952\nYou'd be much better off trying to upgrade\nyour web application to use something\n\n304\n00:15:54.952 --> 00:15:56.140\nother than CHAP, right?\n\n305\n00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.578\nBut if you need to, that option is there.\n\n306\n00:15:58.578 --> 00:16:02.020\nAll right, now to get back to\nwhat Ronnie was heading to,\n\n307\n00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:07.403\nas fast as computers are today, even using\nan eight, nine character complex password,\n\n308\n00:16:07.403 --> 00:16:12.357\nthese guys can rifle through hundreds of\nthousands of possibilities per second,\n\n309\n00:16:12.357 --> 00:16:14.160\nright, on a computer.\n\n310\n00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.940\nSo it doesn't take them that long.\n\n311\n00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:21.749\nThe time it takes to crack a password is\nshrinking as these computers become more\n\n312\n00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:22.480\npowerful.\n\n313\n00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.016\nWhich is why we have to keep\nmaking our passwords longer and\n\n314\n00:16:25.016 --> 00:16:26.115\nlonger to try to keep up.\n\n315\n00:16:26.115 --> 00:16:28.555\nAnd at some point we're\nnot gonna be able to.\n\n316\n00:16:28.555 --> 00:16:31.346\nAnd that day is probably\nright around the corner.\n\n317\n00:16:31.346 --> 00:16:33.148\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But again, that's for\n\n318\n00:16:33.148 --> 00:16:34.519\nanother show as well.\n\n319\n00:16:34.519 --> 00:16:37.695\nBiometrics are the way we're\ngonna end up going, but for\n\n320\n00:16:37.695 --> 00:16:41.250\nnow we're gonna deal with what we've got\nin Active Directory, so that's passwords.\n\n321\n00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.430\nSo how do I stop things like that?\n\n322\n00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:47.390\nHow can I keep my passwords, and my\nnetwork safe if these computers can do so\n\n323\n00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.880\nmany guesses per second that it\ndoesn't take them long to crack\n\n324\n00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.550\na lot of these passwords?\n\n325\n00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.500\nAnd that's the account lockout policies.\n\n326\n00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.305\nIt's turned off by default.\n\n327\n00:16:57.305 --> 00:17:01.670\nThe account lockout threshold is\nset to 0 invalid log on attempts.\n\n328\n00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:05.890\nWhich means, if I want to try to log on\nas Ronnie, I can sit here and guess his\n\n329\n00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:09.820\npassword until the sun goes down and the\ncomputer's not gonna say anything to me.\n\n330\n00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:13.740\nIt's gonna let me continue to guess and\nguess and guess and guess and guess.\n\n331\n00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.150\nSo what we wanna do is\nwe wanna turn that on.\n\n332\n00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:19.580\nIf we wanna limit the number of\nguesses that somebody can do,\n\n333\n00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.770\neither whether that's manually\nsitting at a keyboard guessing or\n\n334\n00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:27.210\nif they're using some kind of\nprogram to do this, we turn this on.\n\n335\n00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:27.770\nAnd we say all right,\n\n336\n00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:32.770\nyou know what, after five invalid\nattempts, I'm gonna lock the account.\n\n337\n00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.110\nThat way it can't be used.\n\n338\n00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:38.750\nIt will not let you send any more\nguesses into Active Directory.\n\n339\n00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.950\nSo I can try to limit what\nthose guys are allowed to do.\n\n340\n00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:44.440\nThere's also two other\nsettings that go with this.\n\n341\n00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.570\nWe don't see them here because\nthis is not turned on.\n\n342\n00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.720\nAnd so\nif you're not using Account Lockout,\n\n343\n00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.350\nthe other two settings\ndon't make any difference.\n\n344\n00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.080\nOnce we turn this on the other\ntwo settings will kick in.\n\n345\n00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.278\nBut to see them, we're gonna have to\ndive into the policy and actually edit.\n\n346\n00:17:58.278 --> 00:18:02.260\nSo let's right-click on this\nDefault Domain Policy and choose Edit.\n\n347\n00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:06.260\nAnd let's take a look at where\nthese settings are, first of all.\n\n348\n00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.333\nUnder the Computer Configuration\n> Policies >\n\n349\n00:18:10.333 --> 00:18:13.818\nWindows Settings > Security Settings.\n\n350\n00:18:13.818 --> 00:18:17.119\nAnd underneath here I'm gonna find my\nAccount Policies which includes my\n\n351\n00:18:17.119 --> 00:18:18.430\nPassword Policy.\n\n352\n00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.900\nThere's all those settings we\nwere just talking about and\n\n353\n00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.690\nall those default values.\n\n354\n00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:25.860\nAnd underneath that is my\nAccount Lockout Policy.\n\n355\n00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:30.120\nAnd the account lockout\nthreshold is set to 0 again.\n\n356\n00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.350\nSo if wanna turn this on I'm\ngonna double-click on it.\n\n357\n00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.430\nOr actually before I do that\nlet's define the other ones.\n\n358\n00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:42.110\nThe other two, notice,\nare not defined because this is set to 0.\n\n359\n00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:46.940\nThe account lockout duration,\nwell this is gonna control how long\n\n360\n00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.730\nthe account remains locked out,\nonce it becomes locked.\n\n361\n00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:54.460\nSo let's say I set it to 5, and somebody\nguessed Ronnie's password five times and\n\n362\n00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.420\ndidn't get it right.\n\n363\n00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.980\nNow his account is locked,\nhow long does it stay locked?\n\n364\n00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.070\nWhen I turn this on,\nit's gonna default to 30 minutes.\n\n365\n00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.350\nWhich means after 30 minutes,\nthe counter starts over and I can, or\n\n366\n00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:08.370\nthe account becomes unlocked or\nit is no longer locked, and\n\n367\n00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.000\nI can try to log in again as Ronnie.\n\n368\n00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.250\nYou can change that to\nwhatever value you want.\n\n369\n00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:17.650\nYou can set it to eight hours,\nwhich would be an entire work day.\n\n370\n00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.130\nOr you could set it all\nthe way down to zero.\n\n371\n00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.940\nWhich would mean it remains\nlocked indefinitely\n\n372\n00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:27.100\nuntil someone manually goes and\nunlocks the account in Active Directory.\n\n373\n00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.931\nAnd that might be what you want,\nbecause if I set it to 30 minutes,\n\n374\n00:19:30.931 --> 00:19:35.521\nif a bad guy is guessing passwords,\nhe guesses five times, account's locked.\n\n375\n00:19:35.521 --> 00:19:38.700\n30 minutes later the account resets,\nhe can guess five more times.\n\n376\n00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.140\nAnd the account gets locked, he waits\n30 minutes, and he tries again, right?\n\n377\n00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.300\nI'll be none the wiser.\n\n378\n00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.370\nIf Ronnie's not there that day,\nhe might not notice anything's\n\n379\n00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.560\ngoing on with his account and\nI'll be none the wiser.\n\n380\n00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.810\nIf I set it to 0, Ronnie's gonna\ncome in and try to log in and go,\n\n381\n00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.725\nmy account is locked.\n\n382\n00:19:54.725 --> 00:19:56.998\nHe's gonna have to come to\nan administrator and say,\n\n383\n00:19:56.998 --> 00:19:58.723\nI need to log in but my account is locked.\n\n384\n00:19:58.723 --> 00:20:02.975\nNow I'm aware of the situation and I can\ngo to look in my auditing and see, look,\n\n385\n00:20:02.975 --> 00:20:06.830\nsomebody was trying to log in\nbefore Ronnie ever made it to work.\n\n386\n00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:09.040\nAnd we need to try to figure out\nwho that is or what's going on.\n\n387\n00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:14.540\nI might do that with some of my more\nimportant accounts, or I might want that\n\n388\n00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:18.280\nnotification, but I can't do it through\nhere so I don't want to dive in that.\n\n389\n00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.330\nCuz this, remember this applies\nto everybody in the domain,\n\n390\n00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:23.880\nincluding the domain admins.\n\n391\n00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.830\nKeep that in mind.\n\n392\n00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.170\nThis is all accounts have\nto follow this policy.\n\n393\n00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:32.440\nThe last one there is Reset\naccount lockout counter after.\n\n394\n00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:36.420\nSo you gotta think about it, every time\nyou guess or type an incorrect password,\n\n395\n00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.900\nthere's a little counter going on.\n\n396\n00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.560\nOkay, that's strike one.\n\n397\n00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.070\nNext time, that's strike two, right?\n\n398\n00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.820\nCuz it's gonna lock it at say\nfive if that's what we've set.\n\n399\n00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.600\nSo it's keeping track of\nthose invalid attempts.\n\n400\n00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:53.010\nHow long does it remember those\nmissed guesses, or those bad guesses?\n\n401\n00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:56.810\nLet's say Ronnie comes in in the morning,\nat 8 o'clock in the morning, and\n\n402\n00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:01.290\nhe goes in to type in his password and\nhe fat-fingers it, and he types it wrong.\n\n403\n00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:02.720\nWell there's strike one.\n\n404\n00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.850\nAnd then he goes oops, silly me, and\nhe types his right password in, and\n\n405\n00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:09.080\nhe logs in, goes throughout the day,\nhe goes to lunch.\n\n406\n00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.857\nHe comes back from lunch and\nhe fat-fingers his password again,\n\n407\n00:21:12.857 --> 00:21:15.960\nis that strike two or is that strike one?\n\n408\n00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.620\nWell it depends on how long\nyou've set this value to, right?\n\n409\n00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.698\nBy default it's gonna set to 30 minutes,\nwhich means that strike from this morning,\n\n410\n00:21:23.698 --> 00:21:26.632\nthat bad guess this morning,\nthat would have been forgotten.\n\n411\n00:21:26.632 --> 00:21:31.330\nAnd so the mistype after lunch\nwould only be strike one.\n\n412\n00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:34.558\nIf I set that to eight hours that means\nit's going to remember the strike from\n\n413\n00:21:34.558 --> 00:21:36.739\nthis morning as well as the one for\nthis afternoon.\n\n414\n00:21:36.739 --> 00:21:40.250\nSo the one after lunch\nwould be strike two, right?\n\n415\n00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.150\nSo that's what you're defining.\n\n416\n00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:43.760\nSo let's go ahead and\nset that value there.\n\n417\n00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.755\nI'm going to double-click on\nAccount lockout threshold, and\n\n418\n00:21:46.755 --> 00:21:47.982\nI'm gonna set this to 5.\n\n419\n00:21:47.982 --> 00:21:52.782\nNow this is another one where we wanna\nbe careful, we wanna think about this.\n\n420\n00:21:52.782 --> 00:21:56.800\nYour company's gonna decide what\nthis policy needs to be set to.\n\n421\n00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.090\nI see people going a little extreme,\nand putting that to 2.\n\n422\n00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.570\nThat's not gonna help you any.\n\n423\n00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:06.928\nBecause what you're gonna be doing is\ngenerating more work for your help desk,\n\n424\n00:22:06.928 --> 00:22:11.432\nor for your admins, or you're gonna\nreduce productivity on your end users.\n\n425\n00:22:11.432 --> 00:22:14.570\nCuz Ronnie's gonna come in and\ntype that password wrong twice.\n\n426\n00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:18.660\nAnd he's gonna say all right, shoot,\nnow I've gotta wait 30 minutes, and\n\n427\n00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:19.960\nthen I can try to log in again.\n\n428\n00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.180\nHe's not gonna call anybody.\n\n429\n00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.492\nHe's just gonna sit there and play\nsolitaire, talk on the phone, go outside,\n\n430\n00:22:24.492 --> 00:22:26.730\ndo whatever, and\ncome back in 30 minutes, right.\n\n431\n00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:29.961\nSo you can get a little too,\nwhat's the word for it,\n\n432\n00:22:29.961 --> 00:22:33.270\na little overzealous\nwith this setting here.\n\n433\n00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.770\nNow I know some military posts,\nthey use like 3, that's pretty secure.\n\n434\n00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:40.750\nYou mistype that thing three time and\nit's locked.\n\n435\n00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.319\nAnd you might think well, who would\nmistype their password three times?\n\n436\n00:22:44.319 --> 00:22:45.596\nYeah?\n>> Yeah, me.\n\n437\n00:22:45.596 --> 00:22:46.594\n>> [LAUGH] Right,\nRonnie's got his hand up over here.\n\n438\n00:22:46.594 --> 00:22:47.233\n>> No doubt, [LAUGH].\n\n439\n00:22:47.233 --> 00:22:51.596\n>> Think about this,\nyou change your password Friday afternoon,\n\n440\n00:22:51.596 --> 00:22:52.980\ncuz it reminds you.\n\n441\n00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.244\nYou get a little pop-up, you change it\non Friday afternoon, you go home for\n\n442\n00:22:56.244 --> 00:22:57.250\nthe weekend.\n\n443\n00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.410\nYou come back in on Monday,\nwhat are you gonna do?\n\n444\n00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:03.370\nYou're gonna log in with your old\npassword and then go, oh that's right,\n\n445\n00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:04.380\nI changed it on Friday.\n\n446\n00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.480\nWell there's already strike one.\n\n447\n00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.590\nNow you gotta remember what\nyou changed it to on Friday\n\n448\n00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:12.200\nbecause you haven't logged in with it, you\njust changed it on Friday and went home.\n\n449\n00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.650\nWhat did I change that to?\n\n450\n00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:16.270\nI think it was Blue 43, right.\n\n451\n00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.070\nWell there's strike two.\n\n452\n00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:21.320\nOne more strike your account is locked,\nright, so really easy to do.\n\n453\n00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.160\nAnd if you've got a map\nto drive somewhere,\n\n454\n00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.250\nthere's other things that count\ntowards that log on process.\n\n455\n00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:32.190\nA phone that has your old passwords\nsaved that's checking your mail.\n\n456\n00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.400\nThose kind of things are gonna add up and\n\n457\n00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.360\nyou can end up locking\nthat account pretty quick.\n\n458\n00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.620\nSo, come up with a good number, whatever\nis appropriate for your environment.\n\n459\n00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.422\nI'm not gonna try to tell you\nwhat's right for your company.\n\n460\n00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:46.510\nBut I will tell you that you go\ntoo low with this number and\n\n461\n00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:49.470\nyou can start generating more work for\nyourself, and\n\n462\n00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:52.457\nyou're really not helping\nsecurity on your system.\n\n463\n00:23:52.457 --> 00:23:55.736\nI'll go ahead and put 5, and click OK.\n\n464\n00:23:55.736 --> 00:23:59.486\nThe other two are gonna default to\n30 minutes as soon as I set that.\n\n465\n00:23:59.486 --> 00:24:02.600\nIf I want to I can come in here and\nchange that.\n\n466\n00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:08.340\nMaybe I want that to remain locked out\na little bit longer, like 60 minutes.\n\n467\n00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:12.570\nOr maybe I wanna reset that\naccount lockout counter after\n\n468\n00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.770\nI don't know, we'll say two hours.\n\n469\n00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:20.590\nSo you can come in here and play with\nthose numbers, and you can see it's gonna\n\n470\n00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:24.040\nchange that duration as well for\nthe account lockout duration.\n\n471\n00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:28.660\nBut again, you can set them to whatever\nis appropriate for your company.\n\n472\n00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.190\nJust like to password policy,\nwe didn't make any changes here,\n\n473\n00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:33.840\nbut we've seen how to configure\ngroup policy settings.\n\n474\n00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:38.840\nIf I want to change the maximum age to 30,\nI can come in here and I can change that.\n\n475\n00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.470\nI just double click on it, and\nset it to whatever value I want.\n\n476\n00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:47.290\nMaybe I want that minimum password length\nto be eight characters instead of seven.\n\n477\n00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.450\nAgain, you think that's one character.\n\n478\n00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:54.840\nIt's a lot of possibilities, it makes\na big difference in your password length,\n\n479\n00:24:54.840 --> 00:25:02.320\nand I'll change their history to, I wanna\nremember the last thirty passwords, woops.\n\n480\n00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.105\n[CROSSTALK] 24.\n>> My maximum was 24.\n\n481\n00:25:03.105 --> 00:25:06.615\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> It won't let me go\nany higher than that, gosh darn it.\n\n482\n00:25:06.615 --> 00:25:10.615\nAll right, so we'll click there,\nwe'll leave that 24, we'll click okay.\n\n483\n00:25:10.615 --> 00:25:11.115\nClose enough.\n\n484\n00:25:11.115 --> 00:25:14.365\nSo, they can get away with six\ndays of reusing that old password,\n\n485\n00:25:14.365 --> 00:25:17.285\nthen they're gonna have\nto change it again.\n\n486\n00:25:17.285 --> 00:25:21.870\nAnd that's really all we do as far as\npassword policies go and account policies.\n\n487\n00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:25.110\nif we want to see any of\nthis in action we could,\n\n488\n00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:30.390\nnow that I've changed that policy,\nlet me restart this machine.\n\n489\n00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.640\nNow remember we've talked about it before.\n\n490\n00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.600\nWhen group policy applies,\nwhat were these settings underneath?\n\n491\n00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.600\nThese were under the computer half, right?\n\n492\n00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.910\nWhich means it's a computer setting,\nand those settings are applied when\n\n493\n00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:48.910\nthe computer starts up, or\nduring that refresh cycle.\n\n494\n00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:51.340\nWhich is why I'm rebooting the machine,\nand not just logging off and\n\n495\n00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:52.830\nlogging back on.\n\n496\n00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.200\n>> Yeah, setting these policies\nare really gonna be important,\n\n497\n00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.930\nespecially inside of\nan Active Directory domain.\n\n498\n00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.630\nBecause it really does it\nat the very basic, right,\n\n499\n00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:06.220\nprovide some nice security for us, or\nend user entry point type of security.\n\n500\n00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:09.460\nIn which the user does have to be\ncareful about using their password and\n\n501\n00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.520\nestablishing the right one that they need,\n\n502\n00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.220\naccording to the way that\nwe've got our policy set up.\n\n503\n00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:19.640\nBut along with that, right, the password\npolicy by itself is not secure enough.\n\n504\n00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.130\nThe reason why, is that if we leave it\nlike that without setting the other\n\n505\n00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:28.020\naccount policy, we will give some attacker\na chance to continue to hack against that\n\n506\n00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.650\nparticular password until they break it.\n\n507\n00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:34.700\nAnd the more time that we give them,\nthe less secure of course that becomes.\n\n508\n00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:38.210\nSo that's why we also need that\ncombination of that second pass,\n\n509\n00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:39.950\nthe account policy as well.\n\n510\n00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.540\nSo we've gotta make sure that we\nunderstand that both of them play\n\n511\n00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.210\na balance in what we need to do.\n\n512\n00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:45.660\nSo Mike, where are we now?\n\n513\n00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:49.300\n>> I've logged in as user on\nthis Windows 8.1 client, and\n\n514\n00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:53.220\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go in and\nchange my password.\n\n515\n00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.620\nSo we'll do a change password, and so\nmy old password, I'll type it in there,\n\n516\n00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.240\nand I'll try to use the same password.\n\n517\n00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.030\nAs my password.\n\n518\n00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:06.440\nSo old password,\nnew password's gonna be the same.\n\n519\n00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.860\nI'll go ahead and try that.\n\n520\n00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:08.850\nIt says unable to update.\n\n521\n00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:13.220\nThe value provided for the new password\ndoes not meet the length, complexity, or\n\n522\n00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.220\nhistory requirements of the domain.\n\n523\n00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.570\nAnd notice it's not real specific there.\n\n524\n00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:21.850\nIt doesn't tell me if it's the same\npassword as before, or if it's too short,\n\n525\n00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:23.350\nor if it's not complex.\n\n526\n00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:24.770\nThe less information I give a bad guy.\n\n527\n00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:27.670\nWhat if a bad guy was sitting\nhere trying to log in as Rob?\n\n528\n00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:32.060\nI don't want to give him details on\nhow long the password needs to be so\n\n529\n00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.940\nthat now he can start\nguessing the right length.\n\n530\n00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:34.660\nRight?\n\n531\n00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.830\nYou want to kind of,\n\n532\n00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:39.680\nit's a security through obscurity\nis what we're gonna say there.\n\n533\n00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:45.369\nSo let me try that again, I'll try\na different password but same length.\n\n534\n00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:48.962\nOops, that's not the same length.\n\n535\n00:27:48.962 --> 00:27:51.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [INAUDIBLE], there we go.\n\n536\n00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:57.000\nSo that has a different password,\nif I can show you,\n\n537\n00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.360\nkind of if you can't really see my,\nthere we go.\n\n538\n00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:04.290\nSo I've changed passwords,\nand it let me change it.\n\n539\n00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:05.700\nWhat did I set the length to, eight?\n\n540\n00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.100\n>> Eight.\n>> So yeah, so that was complex, right?\n\n541\n00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:11.340\nIt had the at symbol, uppercase,\nand it had lowercase.\n\n542\n00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:15.275\nIt was eight, P-A-S-S-W-zero-R-D,\nI can count, yep, that's eight.\n\n543\n00:28:15.275 --> 00:28:17.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it met everything, it was, it.\n\n544\n00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.600\nIt didn't violate my history, so\nit allowed me to change my password.\n\n545\n00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.930\nSo you see that those policies are gonna\nbe enforced when that user logs on or\n\n546\n00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:28.670\nwhen they try to change their password.\n\n547\n00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:32.000\nBefore that,\nI was trying to think of another example.\n\n548\n00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.130\nIf we, let's say I up that to ten.\n\n549\n00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.980\nRight, if I change\nthe password length to ten,\n\n550\n00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.570\nwell Rob's password is\neight characters long.\n\n551\n00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:43.770\nIt's not gonna automatically force\nhim to change his password because\n\n552\n00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:45.105\nhis password is too short.\n\n553\n00:28:45.105 --> 00:28:48.965\nIt will wait until Rob is,\nit's time to change his password.\n\n554\n00:28:48.965 --> 00:28:53.025\nSo if the 24 days,\nI'm sorry what had I said, 30.\n\n555\n00:28:53.025 --> 00:28:56.265\nIf 30 days rolls by, and it's time for\nRob to change his password,\n\n556\n00:28:56.265 --> 00:28:59.905\nwhen he goes to change it, that's when\nthose new settings are going to kick in.\n\n557\n00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:03.505\nSo understand that it doesn't go out and\nlook at all your user's passwords and say,\n\n558\n00:29:03.505 --> 00:29:04.775\noh now you're in violation.\n\n559\n00:29:04.775 --> 00:29:07.775\nThey changed the policy, you're going\nto have to change your password\n\n560\n00:29:07.775 --> 00:29:10.080\nbecause you're no longer meet policy.\n\n561\n00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:10.940\nIt's not gonna do that.\n\n562\n00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.810\nThe only time it's gonna check it,\nis when they change it.\n\n563\n00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:17.530\nSo when time rolls around for him to\nchange his password, that's when those new\n\n564\n00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:21.270\nsettings will kick in, or if they\ndecide to change their password early.\n\n565\n00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.450\nRight?\nThat's when those settings will\n\n566\n00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:23.760\nkick in as well.\n\n567\n00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.870\n>> All right, Mike,\nthat's a lot of great information for us,\n\n568\n00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:31.450\nunderstanding the use of password\npolicies as well as account policies.\n\n569\n00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:33.860\nWell we've actually done in\nthis particular segment, right.\n\n570\n00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.750\nIs we took a look at those\npolicies specifically,\n\n571\n00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:39.110\ntrying to understand that\nthey are gonna be in use,\n\n572\n00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:42.600\nespecially in side of active directory,\nyou're not gonna get around them.\n\n573\n00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.940\nIs there a way to disable the entire\npolicy, do you know Mike?\n\n574\n00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.700\n>> As far as the domain admin\ngoes I could but user no,\n\n575\n00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.620\nand even local users on that system.\n\n576\n00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.360\nIf that machine is part of the domain.\n\n577\n00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:55.690\nThat's a machine setting.\n\n578\n00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:57.590\nIt applies before anybody logs in,\n\n579\n00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:01.590\neven local users on that machine\nwill now have to follow that policy.\n\n580\n00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:02.510\n>> Excellent.\n\n581\n00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:05.700\nNow the security setting\nare very important.\n\n582\n00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:10.380\nThe one thing that I guess I've at some\npoint in the world forgot, is that\n\n583\n00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:15.660\npassword policy actually only applies at\nthe domain level, and not anywhere else.\n\n584\n00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.870\nAnd that's something we\nalso have to keep in mind.\n\n585\n00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:19.900\nWe're actually setting\nthese policies as well.\n\n586\n00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:24.030\nSo take a look at using password policies\nas well as the account policies together.\n\n587\n00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:28.630\nIn combination gives us a very effective\nand user basic security policy.\n\n588\n00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:32.590\nThank you Mike for showing us where to\ngo inside of the group policy management\n\n589\n00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:36.490\nconsole to actually set those things up,\nand for the example we also gave.\n\n590\n00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:39.680\nThank you also for watching us today.\n\n591\n00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.500\nSigning off for ITPro TV, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n592\n00:30:42.500 -->

00:00:20.520\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today we're\ntaking look at working with group policy.\n\n4\n00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.540\nSpecifically, we're going to be taking and\nconfiguring the user's desktop or\n\n5\n00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.840\ntheir environment.\n\n6\n00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.390\nAnd this is actually a very important\ntopic because, a lot of times, it's not\n\n7\n00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.730\nreally about what the user wants, it's\nabout what we need to do to control that.\n\n8\n00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.050\nAnd who better to help us than Mr.\nMike Rogers.\n\n9\n00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.280\nMike, let's talk about this idea of\nconfiguring some user environments and\n\n10\n00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.970\ntheir desktops, and why it's so\nimportant for us to do so.\n\n11\n00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.572\n>> Absolutely, one of the great\nthings about group policy, and\n\n12\n00:00:45.572 --> 00:00:47.300\nwe've said this from\nthe beginning of this series,\n\n13\n00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.880\nis that it's all about centralized\nconfiguration management.\n\n14\n00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.920\nAnd so it gives me thousands and\n\n15\n00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.280\nthousands of settings that I can use\nto control that user's environment,\n\n16\n00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.590\nwhat it is that they get every\ntime they log onto those machines.\n\n17\n00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.710\nGives me the ability to do it from one\nlocation rather than have to go to\n\n18\n00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.880\nevery single machine and\ntry to configure these options, right?\n\n19\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.580\nAnd so as we go through these, I wanna\ntry to give you some real world examples\n\n20\n00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.350\nof what we might do using group policy\nto affect our user environment.\n\n21\n00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.152\nThe one we're gonna to do today,\nI'm gonna talk about user desktops.\n\n22\n00:01:21.152 --> 00:01:25.660\nI wanna talk about folder redirection\nas well as log on and start up and\n\n23\n00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.530\nlog off and shut down scripts.\n\n24\n00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.670\nA couple of them are very commonly\nused in most enterprises.\n\n25\n00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.500\nAnd we'll start with, Ronnie,\nthe concept of folder redirection.\n\n26\n00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.030\nAnd this is one that a lot of\norganizations do because, well,\n\n27\n00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.420\nwe don't want our users storing\nfiles on their local machine\n\n28\n00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.680\nbecause we don't run around and\nback up every machine.\n\n29\n00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.550\nAnd if their machine fails, if they get\na virus, if their hardware fails or\n\n30\n00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.540\nsomething like that,\nI can reimage their machine in 15 minutes.\n\n31\n00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.370\nBut what about all the data\nthat was on there?\n\n32\n00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.524\nSo we try to get them to\nput it somewhere else.\n\n33\n00:01:58.524 --> 00:02:02.796\nNow, when we start taking a look at that,\nMike, cuz that's an,\n\n34\n00:02:02.796 --> 00:02:05.730\nI can't say it, incredibly,\nimportant topic.\n\n35\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.300\nAnd the reason is because most people\ndo it anyways, they'll still go,\n\n36\n00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.820\nno, I just wanna save everything\non my desktop just in case\n\n37\n00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.370\nsomething happens to that network\nshare that I want them redirected to.\n\n38\n00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.710\nBut the reason why we don't want that\nis because a lot of times those desktop\n\n39\n00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.830\nmachines, right,\nthey're not rated to be on 24 hours a day,\n\n40\n00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.480\nthey're not backed up regularly.\n\n41\n00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.065\nAnd so what we want to do is,\nwe want to actually trick the user.\n\n42\n00:02:25.065 --> 00:02:26.000\n>> Yes.\n>> I think is what we're\n\n43\n00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.705\ntrying to do here.\n\n44\n00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:27.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that they don't even know what's\n\n45\n00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.600\ngoing on, right?\n\n46\n00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.110\n>> It really is.\n\n47\n00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.270\n>> Okay.\n>> It's exactly what we're gonna\n\n48\n00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.450\ndo because you can have all\nthe meetings you want, and\n\n49\n00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.570\nyou can map a network drive for them, and\n\n50\n00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.080\nyou can say, look anything that's\nimportant needs to go on this map drive.\n\n51\n00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.820\nYou need to save it.\n\n52\n00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.412\nWhen you go to file, save.\n\n53\n00:02:40.412 --> 00:02:44.945\nChoose x: and put it here because we\nback up that file server every night.\n\n54\n00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:45.968\nThey don't do that.\n\n55\n00:02:45.968 --> 00:02:46.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz\n\n56\n00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.900\nwhen they go the their defaults right,\nwhen they open up Word, or Excel and\n\n57\n00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.915\nthey do file>save,\nwhere does it go by default?\n\n58\n00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:53.480\nTheir My Documents.\n\n59\n00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.150\nI mean from using home computers and\nthings like that, we're used to putting\n\n60\n00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.650\nstuff in My Documents or My Pictures,\nMy Music or whatever the case may be.\n\n61\n00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.950\nSo it's hard to get that\nuser to stop doing that, and\n\n62\n00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.900\nputting it up there on that map drive.\n\n63\n00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.152\nAnd inevitably what happens\nis they come to you,\n\n64\n00:03:09.152 --> 00:03:13.430\ntheir machine has failed, they've gotta\nreplace the hard drive in there so\n\n65\n00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.190\nIT comes through and blows it away,\nthey put the new hard drive in there.\n\n66\n00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.890\nThey reimage it, and now the user calls\nyou up and says, where's all my stuff?\n\n67\n00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.010\nDid you put it on the map network drive?\n\n68\n00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.240\nNo, it was in My Documents.\n\n69\n00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.930\nAnd then the story goes on.\n\n70\n00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.640\nSo now we've gotta deal with that, and\nthere's no way to get that stuff back.\n\n71\n00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.130\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna use\na policy to redirect their My Documents.\n\n72\n00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.470\nWe're gonna trick them, as Ronnie said,\nwe're gonna behind the scenes\n\n73\n00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.590\nmake their My Documents, basically,\na mapped drive to a folder up on a server.\n\n74\n00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.690\nAnd so when they dump\nsomething into My Documents,\n\n75\n00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.280\nit's not actually being stored\non their local machine.\n\n76\n00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.210\nIt's gonna be stored up on\nthis file server somewhere.\n\n77\n00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.610\nAnd I back up that file\nserver every night.\n\n78\n00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.510\nSo when I do have to replace their hard\ndrive on that client machine, and they get\n\n79\n00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.450\ntheir new operating system installed,\nand they log back in, guess what?\n\n80\n00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.830\nTheir documents are all gonna be\nthere still because it wasn't located\n\n81\n00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.490\nlocally on the machine anymore.\n\n82\n00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.510\nSo let's take a look\nat how we can do that.\n\n83\n00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.500\nThe first thing we're gonna need really\nis someplace to redirect them to.\n\n84\n00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.380\nSo what I've got, I've got a file\nserver here, and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n85\n00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.420\nmake a new share and\nI'm gonna call this, New Folder.\n\n86\n00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.550\nAnd I'm gonna call this Docs, and\nI'm gonna go ahead and share it out.\n\n87\n00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.090\nAnd I'm gonna do something kinda strange,\nI'm gonna say specific people and\n\n88\n00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.690\nI'm gonna do Everyone, and\nI'm gonna give them Read Write.\n\n89\n00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.150\nAnd we know how this wizard works.\n\n90\n00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.400\nThat's gonna share it out, give\neveryone read, write, share permission.\n\n91\n00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.000\nIt's also gonna give\neveryone NTFS full control.\n\n92\n00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.220\nSo at this point,\ndoesn't seem all that secure.\n\n93\n00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.010\nAnd that's okay because Group Policy is\ngonna take care of setting the appropriate\n\n94\n00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.650\npermissions on the folders, and\nit's gonna make the folders for me.\n\n95\n00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.270\nI don't have to go through and think,\nokay I need a folder for Ronnie,\n\n96\n00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.420\nI need a folder for Rob,\nI need one for Wes, and one for Jason.\n\n97\n00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.185\nIt's gonna take care of making them for\nme, and setting the permissions.\n\n98\n00:05:09.185 --> 00:05:11.740\nNow you can, you can set\nthe permissions manually if you want.\n\n99\n00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But why, [LAUGH] would be my question.\n\n100\n00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.310\nYou're just like torturing yourself or\nsomething.\n\n101\n00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.820\nSo now I've got that folder created,\nI'm gonna go to Tools, and\n\n102\n00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.380\nthen Group Policy management.\n\n103\n00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.770\nAnd let's say I wanna redirect all of my\n\n104\n00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.980\ndevelopers because their work,\ntheir new code they're writing and\n\n105\n00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.550\nstuff like that, I wanna make sure\nI've got a good backup of that stuff.\n\n106\n00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.040\nSo I'm gonna move their My Documents\nup there to that file server.\n\n107\n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.561\nSo I'm gonna create a new GPU, and\n\n108\n00:05:42.561 --> 00:05:46.695\nI'm gonna call it Dev Folder Redirect.\n\n109\n00:05:49.494 --> 00:05:53.630\nAnd I'll go ahead and make sure I\nlink it to that developer's OU.\n\n110\n00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.230\nThen I'm gonna edit that policy.\n\n111\n00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.020\nNow, folder redirection is\ngonna be a user setting.\n\n112\n00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.556\nSo underneath the user half of this\npolicy I'll expand out Policies.\n\n113\n00:06:04.556 --> 00:06:11.480\nThen I'll expand out Windows settings, and\nthen I'll expand out Folder Redirection.\n\n114\n00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.120\nAnd there's basically if I remember 13,\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,\n\n115\n00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.570\n9, 10, 11, 12, 13 different folders\nthat I can redirect using Group Policy.\n\n116\n00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.930\nSo I can't just randomly pick a folder and\nredirect it.\n\n117\n00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.870\nIt's only these folders here.\n\n118\n00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.510\nBut these are my most important ones,\nright?\n\n119\n00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.830\nMy Desktop,\npeople love to put stuff on their desktop.\n\n120\n00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.270\nAlthough I'll find I typically don't\nredirect that because people put lots of\n\n121\n00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.190\nstuff on their desktop like entire\napplications that they've downloaded, and\n\n122\n00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.810\nthings like that.\n\n123\n00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.575\nBut something your company can decide.\n\n124\n00:06:41.795 --> 00:06:45.935\nStart Menu, Documents,\nFavorites is another great one.\n\n125\n00:06:45.935 --> 00:06:47.295\nHow frustrating is that, Ronnie,\n\n126\n00:06:47.295 --> 00:06:51.565\nI mean you've got a hundred favorites in\nthere and they blow away your machine.\n\n127\n00:06:51.565 --> 00:06:54.575\nYou come back to it,\nand everything's gone.\n\n128\n00:06:54.575 --> 00:06:57.455\n>> Yeah, if you're like me and\nyou use your favorites constantly.\n\n129\n00:06:57.455 --> 00:07:02.125\nThe very fact is I use Favorites just\nbecause I don't have time to read that.\n\n130\n00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:03.650\nI need to read that later on.\n\n131\n00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.780\nAnd now, I actually did this this\nthis past weekend where I went and\n\n132\n00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.640\nactually did this to my own computer.\n\n133\n00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.420\nAnd I came up and said why is\nmy favorites not appearing, but\n\n134\n00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.230\nit just took a little bit,\na moment of time.\n\n135\n00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.710\nBut one of the things I absolutely\nwas glad about is those favorites\n\n136\n00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:16.570\ncame through.\n\n137\n00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.684\nWith the folder redirection,\nimagine having them saved somewhere else.\n\n138\n00:07:19.684 --> 00:07:23.044\nYou do, you bring a brand new machine,\nlet's say your company's upgrading, and\n\n139\n00:07:23.044 --> 00:07:24.772\nnow they actually go ahead and\ndo that, and\n\n140\n00:07:24.772 --> 00:07:27.870\nall their stuff is exactly the way\nthat they felt like it should be.\n\n141\n00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.942\nThey're gonna be much happier at the very\nend that you were able to do that for\n\n142\n00:07:30.942 --> 00:07:34.110\nthem, and that they didn't actually\nhave to do anything extra because we're\n\n143\n00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.627\nactually not telling them where\nthe stuff is actually saved.\n\n144\n00:07:36.627 --> 00:07:37.235\n>> That's right.\n\n145\n00:07:37.235 --> 00:07:38.979\n>> You're really gonna\nsave a lot of headache.\n\n146\n00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:41.746\n>> Yeah, and something we really\ndidn't mention is the fact that,\n\n147\n00:07:41.746 --> 00:07:44.720\nwhat if you have people that move\nfrom one machine to another?\n\n148\n00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.460\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n149\n00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.332\nIf you've got my documents on machine A,\nand you put something in there,\n\n150\n00:07:49.332 --> 00:07:53.031\nyou go to machine B and log in,\nyou don't see those same My Documents.\n\n151\n00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:56.151\nIt's a local resource on that\nlocal hard drive of that machine.\n\n152\n00:07:56.151 --> 00:07:58.191\nIf I'm redirecting up to a file server.\n\n153\n00:07:58.191 --> 00:08:00.756\nNow it doesn't matter which\nmachine you go to log on,\n\n154\n00:08:00.756 --> 00:08:03.330\nit's always pointing to\nthe same my documents.\n\n155\n00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.910\nSo you log onto machine A on Monday and\nyou put something in your my documents,\n\n156\n00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:10.250\nyou come in on Tuesday and they issue you\na different laptop that you sit down at\n\n157\n00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.210\nyour cubicle with and\nwork on, doesn't matter.\n\n158\n00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.730\nIt'll connect to the same my documents up\nthere on that file server, it's a really\n\n159\n00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.970\nnice benefit and we can combine this with\nother technologies like roaming profiles,\n\n160\n00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.640\nand make a really nice environment for\nmy users.\n\n161\n00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.570\nWell let's see how it works.\n\n162\n00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.400\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsimply redirect to my documents.\n\n163\n00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.360\nSo I'm gonna choose the folder that I\nwanna redirect, and I'll right click.\n\n164\n00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.450\nThere's a little different from most\nof the GPOs we work with than the group\n\n165\n00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.510\npolicies settings.\n\n166\n00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.700\nThere's nothing to double click on out\nhere and choose enable or disable right?\n\n167\n00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.220\nWhat you do is you right\nclick on documents.\n\n168\n00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.180\nAnd you choose Properties and\nin the properties,\n\n169\n00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.420\nthis is where I'm gonna go in and\nconfigure all of my options.\n\n170\n00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.220\nNow, the first thing I have to do is turn\nit on, and you don't have like a, enable,\n\n171\n00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.230\ndisable, and not configured, you have,\nnot configured, basic, and advanced.\n\n172\n00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:00.490\nBasic is redirect everyone's\nfolder to the same location.\n\n173\n00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:05.080\nAdvanced, specify locations for\nvarious users' groups.\n\n174\n00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:10.380\nNow when I say redirect everyone's to\nthe same location, I'm not talking\n\n175\n00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.540\nabout dumping everybody's stuff into one\nfolder so we have a shared My Documents.\n\n176\n00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.580\nWhat I'm saying is everybody's\ngoing to get their own folder, but\n\n177\n00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.812\nthey're all gonna be under\nthe same root Server01\\docs,\n\n178\n00:09:21.812 --> 00:09:25.040\nthat folder that I just\ncreated a second ago.\n\n179\n00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.970\nSome environments, that might not work.\n\n180\n00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.900\nI might want my developer's my\ndocuments on a different server\n\n181\n00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.770\nthan everybody else's my documents because\nthey have different security requirements.\n\n182\n00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:38.870\nMaybe they're doing R&D that\nI've gotta follow industry or\n\n183\n00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:43.380\ngovernmental regulations and I have to\ncontrol encryption or secure access.\n\n184\n00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.790\nSo what I'm saying is do I want\neverybody's to go to the same route?\n\n185\n00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.490\nOr do I want like the host be\nredirected over here on to Server1 but\n\n186\n00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.280\nthe developers be redirected\nover here to Server2?\n\n187\n00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.670\nSo you're choosing where the root\nis either for everybody or\n\n188\n00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.170\ndifferent groups of people.\n\n189\n00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:58.940\nAnd I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n190\n00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:03.300\ndo Basic, which means everybody\nin the same location.\n\n191\n00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.720\nAnd then, here, Create a folder for\neach user under the root path.\n\n192\n00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.760\nNow there's a couple of different options.\n\n193\n00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.960\nYou can go to the home directory,\nredirect to a special location, or\n\n194\n00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.530\nto the user profile location if you\nhad set up those roaming profiles.\n\n195\n00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.770\nAnd wanted to put them in the same place,\nI'm going to leave it under the default\n\n196\n00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:24.770\nhere, create a folder for\neach user under the root path.\n\n197\n00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:29.520\nSo that's where you see each person is\nstill going to get their own folder and\n\n198\n00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.870\nin the root path I simply have to put in\nmy path to where I want them redirected.\n\n199\n00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:37.900\nRemember, if you click Browse and\nyou try to browse to that,\n\n200\n00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.980\nyou're end up putting a Windows path and\nnot a UNC path.\n\n201\n00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.110\nThis won't work.\n\n202\n00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:49.700\nIt can't be E colon backslash,\nwhatever the case may be, data, or docs.\n\n203\n00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.360\nIt has to be a UNC path.\n\n204\n00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.330\nCuz when the policy applies to Ronnie's\nmachine you don't want Ronnie's machine\n\n205\n00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.900\nlooking at the local drive,\nif he even has an E drive for that folder.\n\n206\n00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.168\nIt's gotta have the UNC pass.\n\n207\n00:11:01.168 --> 00:11:04.162\nSo it knows to reach out across\nthe network and get to that.\n\n208\n00:11:04.162 --> 00:11:11.700\nSo we'll do //SBRO1/docs\nwas the name of that share.\n\n209\n00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:16.890\nAnd it gives you an example If you had\na username Claire, under that root folder,\n\n210\n00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.860\nit's gonna make a folder called Claire.\n\n211\n00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.980\nUnderneath that,\nit's gonna make a folder called documents.\n\n212\n00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:22.980\nAll right.\n\n213\n00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:28.260\nAnd then on the settings tab, grant the\nuser User exclusive rights to documents.\n\n214\n00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.400\nThis is why I'm not worried about those\npermissions that I set on the root\n\n215\n00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.980\ninheriting down and\nme having access to Ronnie's documents or\n\n216\n00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.880\nvice versa, cause I know the policy\nis gonna make sure that that user\n\n217\n00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.420\nhas exclusive rights to the my documents.\n\n218\n00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.680\nNow, you don't have to.\n\n219\n00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.937\nRight?\nYou could uncheck that, I suppose.\n\n220\n00:11:44.937 --> 00:11:48.471\nBut users typically have\nan expectancy of privacy.\n\n221\n00:11:48.471 --> 00:11:50.452\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> When it comes to My Documents, right?\n\n222\n00:11:50.452 --> 00:11:51.660\n>> They do.\n\n223\n00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.770\nYou don't want them to actually feel like,\nand really that they're actually having to\n\n224\n00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:00.200\nshare that or somebody else can actually\nlook in to their own my documents folder.\n\n225\n00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.170\nSo by being able to do this, no matter how\nbig your organization is you can store\n\n226\n00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.440\nall those in one location and have them\nbacked up and each one actually is gonna\n\n227\n00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.970\nbe separated out and those permissions\nthat are there are gonna be set for them.\n\n228\n00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.177\nThis is the easier way to do it.\n\n229\n00:12:13.177 --> 00:12:16.642\nLike I said we could do it for\nevery single person and then change those\n\n230\n00:12:16.642 --> 00:12:20.551\npermissions, you're gonna be in world\nof hurt and trouble when you do that.\n\n231\n00:12:20.551 --> 00:12:24.030\n>> [LAUGH] I can't imagine doing all\nof that manually, just too much work.\n\n232\n00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.380\n>> No, yeah, you shouldn't have\nto ever do it manually, but\n\n233\n00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.576\nyeah I've screwed up these permissions\nbefore and that's something you don't\n\n234\n00:12:29.576 --> 00:12:32.071\nwanna have to manually try to correct,\nI guarantee it, yeah.\n\n235\n00:12:32.071 --> 00:12:33.981\n>> [LAUGH] Oh good old terminal service.\n\n236\n00:12:33.981 --> 00:12:36.886\n>> [LAUGH] Oh yeah that's why I\nscrewed it up, that's exactly right.\n\n237\n00:12:36.886 --> 00:12:41.249\n>> [LAUGH] The next check mark down\nis move the contents of documents\n\n238\n00:12:41.249 --> 00:12:43.320\nto the new location.\n\n239\n00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.100\nAnother great option right?\n\n240\n00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.760\nLet's say they've been using their\ncomputers for months, years whatever and\n\n241\n00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.060\nall of a sudden we're gonna\nstart doing folder redirection.\n\n242\n00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.368\nSo I come in on the weekend or\nFriday and I make this new policy.\n\n243\n00:12:54.368 --> 00:12:58.276\nI set it up Ronnie you come in on Monday\nmorning you log in you go to my documents\n\n244\n00:12:58.276 --> 00:12:59.509\nand nothing's there.\n\n245\n00:12:59.509 --> 00:13:01.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's blank.\n\n246\n00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:02.210\nPanic sets in.\n\n247\n00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:03.250\nWhere is all my stuff?\n\n248\n00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.720\nThink about all the phone calls\nfrom every employee that's\n\n249\n00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.140\nnow going down to the help desk.\n\n250\n00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.910\nI've logged in and My Documents is gone.\n\n251\n00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.150\nMy desktop is cleared.\n\n252\n00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.500\nMy Favorites are gone.\n\n253\n00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:17.170\nSo what I wanna do is take their existing\nMy Documents from that machine they're\n\n254\n00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:21.240\nlogging onto and\nmove it up into this network location.\n\n255\n00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.440\nTo where we're redirecting to that way,\nheck,\n\n256\n00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:29.140\nthey almost don't even notice that\nthis redirection has even occurred.\n\n257\n00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.080\nSo I love that option there.\n\n258\n00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.650\nThe other one you've got to think\nabout is backwards compatibility.\n\n259\n00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:38.480\nThis setting won't work with\nanything prior to 2003 and XP.\n\n260\n00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.890\nYou can turn that on.\n\n261\n00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:44.610\nRemember, XP and\n2003 it was C: Documents and Settings.\n\n262\n00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.700\nVista and later it was C: Users.\n\n263\n00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.480\nSo the profiles or the folders\nwere in different locations, so\n\n264\n00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.290\nyou'd have to check that if you needed\nto provide backwards compatibility.\n\n265\n00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:56.510\nThe last setting down here,\n\n266\n00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.350\nleave the folder in the new location\nwhen its policy is removed or\n\n267\n00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:04.170\nredirect the folder back to the local\nuser profile When the policy is removed.\n\n268\n00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.960\nLet's say we move that user\nout of the development OU.\n\n269\n00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.480\nBecause I'm linking this\njust to the development OU.\n\n270\n00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.750\nThey change department they go to host.\n\n271\n00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:15.380\nDo I want their folder to still be\nredirected to that same location?\n\n272\n00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.471\nOr host I'm not worried about\nredirecting and I want to move it back\n\n273\n00:14:18.471 --> 00:14:22.018\ndown to the local machine for them,\nso that's what we're choosing there.\n\n274\n00:14:22.018 --> 00:14:25.435\n>> Now Mike before we move on from there,\nthat last check box that you saw there, or\n\n275\n00:14:25.435 --> 00:14:26.672\nthat you were pointing out.\n\n276\n00:14:26.672 --> 00:14:31.334\nThe apply, also apply redirection policy,\nif I only have one XP machine,\n\n277\n00:14:31.334 --> 00:14:33.338\nI still have to have this right?\n\n278\n00:14:33.338 --> 00:14:35.940\n>> Yes you do or\nit will not work on that one XP machine.\n\n279\n00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.970\nOr if they come in and they build\na new machine and they put XP on it,\n\n280\n00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:45.340\ntheir documents won't be redirected,\nso you'll see a blank document and\n\n281\n00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.740\nanything they put in there,\nit won't get redirected up there.\n\n282\n00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.950\nSo they go log on to\nthat Windows 8 machine.\n\n283\n00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.170\nThey won't see that document.\n\n284\n00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:55.910\nSo if you had any clients,\nyep, you gotta enforce that.\n\n285\n00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.385\n>> Yeah, it was always amazing to\nme cuz I was used to thinking oh,\n\n286\n00:14:58.385 --> 00:14:59.616\nif I have the majority of them.\n\n287\n00:14:59.616 --> 00:15:01.360\nBut no, if you even have one-\n>> [LAUGH] Yup.\n\n288\n00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.100\n>> You have to have this, so\nmake sure you're also aware of that too.\n\n289\n00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.480\n>> All right, so we'll go ahead and\nturn this on, I'll click OK.\n\n290\n00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.170\nAnd it's gonna warn me, hey, this isn't\ngonna work on your down level clients.\n\n291\n00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.560\nAnd I'll say yes, that's okay,\neverybody's upgraded to Windows 8.1.\n\n292\n00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.840\nAnd now you'll see that really\nnothing changes in this view.\n\n293\n00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.820\nRight?\n\n294\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.700\nSo to see those settings again I\nwould have to right-click on it and\n\n295\n00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.400\ngo back into Properties if I\nneeded to make any changes.\n\n296\n00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.650\nAll right, so we are good.\n\n297\n00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:28.750\nI've got that set up.\n\n298\n00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.120\nIt is linked to that developer's OU.\n\n299\n00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.710\nSo to test it need to log in\nas a user that's in that ou.\n\n300\n00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:35.630\nSo we'll flip over here.\n\n301\n00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.450\nThis is one Ronnie that I will say\n\n302\n00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:42.550\nsometimes doesn't kick in on\nthat first try for some reason.\n\n303\n00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:47.102\n>> You know sometimes you end up having to\nlog off log back in and actually even do\n\n304\n00:15:47.102 --> 00:15:51.391\nit a couple of times before those\npolicies do kick in and put it in place.\n\n305\n00:15:51.391 --> 00:15:53.754\nAnd don't forget,\nif it is being redirected and\n\n306\n00:15:53.754 --> 00:15:57.270\nyou have a gigantic my documents\nfolder now, I don't know big yours is,\n\n307\n00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:59.421\nmine's like, it's gigs of information.\n\n308\n00:15:59.421 --> 00:16:02.637\nIt might take a little bit of time,\nbecause now it's redirecting all of\n\n309\n00:16:02.637 --> 00:16:05.061\nthat material Up to whatever\nthat common storage is.\n\n310\n00:16:05.061 --> 00:16:07.913\nSo depending on your network\nsaturation and what the,\n\n311\n00:16:07.913 --> 00:16:10.890\nit may take a bit of time before\neverything gets up there.\n\n312\n00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:15.110\nBut it is working, you just have to\nbe a little bit more patient for it.\n\n313\n00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:16.110\n>> So let's see what happens here.\n\n314\n00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.100\nI've logged on as Rob,\n\n315\n00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.650\nhe's in that development OU and\nI'll open up File Explorer.\n\n316\n00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.579\nAnd I'm gonna go over\nto My Documents here.\n\n317\n00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:27.860\nAnd really can't see anything.\n\n318\n00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.936\nIf we look at Documents, and let's go\ninto the actual profile real quick.\n\n319\n00:16:31.936 --> 00:16:35.524\nUsers, Rob, and documents.\n\n320\n00:16:35.524 --> 00:16:37.420\nYou'll see that nothing\nreally has changed.\n\n321\n00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.730\nIf I pull up the properties of documents,\nI'll see it's still a local resource.\n\n322\n00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.690\nSo that means that has not kicked in yet.\n\n323\n00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:47.620\nAnd what I would do for\nmost scenarios I'm okay with that.\n\n324\n00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.780\nIf it takes another log-on to get\nit to work, that's fine, right?\n\n325\n00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.840\nThe next time Rob logs on,\nit should kick in.\n\n326\n00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.620\nLet's find out.\n\n327\n00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.570\nAnd if it doesn't, I'll show you\nhow to troubleshoot some of this.\n\n328\n00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.990\nBut it was a user setting,\nit's not under the computer half,\n\n329\n00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.740\nit's under the user half.\n\n330\n00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:07.930\nSo it should, policy refreshes when\nthat user logs off and logs back on.\n\n331\n00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:12.610\nOr during that normal\n90-minute refresh interval.\n\n332\n00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:15.782\nAs you remember, Rob's password is the one\nI changed in the previous episode.\n\n333\n00:17:15.782 --> 00:17:16.548\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n334\n00:17:16.548 --> 00:17:19.055\nlet's login with the right password there.\n\n335\n00:17:19.055 --> 00:17:22.790\nAll right, so again, I'll flip over to\nFile Explorer and we'll see if it's kicked\n\n336\n00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:27.600\nin yet, take a look at documents,\nand immediately, I can tell.\n\n337\n00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.870\nI don't know if anybody out there\nhas noticed the difference yet.\n\n338\n00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:33.530\nIt is still just a blank folder,\nyou are like what is different Mike?\n\n339\n00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.110\nLook down here at the bottom.\n\n340\n00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:38.660\nWhen I selected documents,\nit now says state online and\n\n341\n00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:43.440\nit now has this little active sync or\nthe old active sync icon down there.\n\n342\n00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.470\nThat is the change, that is what\nusers probably won't even notice.\n\n343\n00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:51.500\nRight, I can still come in here and\nI can make new files and\n\n344\n00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.030\nnew folders or whatever I want to do.\n\n345\n00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:59.100\nI don't have any idea, most likely,\nthat my documents have been redirected.\n\n346\n00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.980\nBut if I pull up the properties,\nlook at the location now.\n\n347\n00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:07.420\nIt's no longer a local path,\nit's up on that file server.\n\n348\n00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:11.350\nBut again, your users probably\nwon't even notice the difference.\n\n349\n00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:14.990\nUntil a failure occurs, and you gotta\ndo a restore, and you put it back and\n\n350\n00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:18.270\nthey're like all my documents\nare still here, you're magical.\n\n351\n00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.450\nAnd I'm like, yeah just go buy me some\nMountain Dew and we'll call it even.\n\n352\n00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:24.840\nNow if I go over to file server and\nI open up file explorer.\n\n353\n00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.720\nAnd we redirected that\nto this docs folder.\n\n354\n00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.720\nSure enough,\nthere it made a sub folder for Rob.\n\n355\n00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.080\nAnd I can go in there.\n\n356\n00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.840\nNow I won't be able to get in here.\n\n357\n00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.500\nRight, because I'm not a,\nit gave him exclusive rights.\n\n358\n00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.430\nNow as an admin I can always get\naccess if I really wanted to.\n\n359\n00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:44.390\nBut I'm okay with my users having\nthat sense of privacy there\n\n360\n00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:45.360\nunless something goes wrong.\n\n361\n00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.390\nSo that's it.\n\n362\n00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:47.590\nThat's folder redirection.\n\n363\n00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:51.790\nReally easy to do, sometimes it does,\none of the caveats there,\n\n364\n00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:55.410\nsometimes it does take a couple\nof tries before it kicks in.\n\n365\n00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.220\nBut in the end I'm okay with\nthat cuz if it doesn't kick in,\n\n366\n00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.230\nthey still have their local My Documents.\n\n367\n00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.050\nAnd as soon as it does kick in\nit's gonna move all that up there.\n\n368\n00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.730\nIf I chose that check mark.\n\n369\n00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.610\nAnd again,\nthey're gonna be none the wiser.\n\n370\n00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:12.360\n>> Yeah, the only added caution that I\nwould tell you, is make sure on your\n\n371\n00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.000\nfolder redirection, if you're redirecting\neverybody in your organization,\n\n372\n00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.190\nmake sure you have\nplenty of storage space.\n\n373\n00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.630\nAnd keep monitoring that thing.\n\n374\n00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:24.900\nBecause when it starts getting to that\npoint where that storage device becomes\n\n375\n00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:25.660\nwell, full.\n\n376\n00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.230\nIt becomes full.\n\n377\n00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.020\nNow you have a problem because\nyou start moving things around,\n\n378\n00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.810\npermissions get changed.\n\n379\n00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:32.915\nAnd, how do I know that?\n\n380\n00:19:32.915 --> 00:19:34.870\n[LAUGH] Because, I know that.\n\n381\n00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:35.970\nSo, just be careful.\n\n382\n00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.785\nYou are going to be using remote storage.\n\n383\n00:19:38.785 --> 00:19:42.055\nMake sure you pay attention to those\nthings and don't just decide that\n\n384\n00:19:42.055 --> 00:19:45.405\nyou are going to seize people's\npermissions, it's not a good idea.\n\n385\n00:19:45.405 --> 00:19:46.265\n>> No, not a good idea.\n\n386\n00:19:46.265 --> 00:19:50.780\nAnd this is also a great place\nto use our quotas, right?\n\n387\n00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.950\nWe use our file service resource\nmanager and we set quotas.\n\n388\n00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:57.070\nAnd I'll set it really high,\nthat server's got plenty of space and\n\n389\n00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:01.840\nI'm gonna give each user well more\nthan they would ever hopefully need.\n\n390\n00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.900\nBut I do want to put a limit\ncuz Ronnie's absolutely right,\n\n391\n00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:08.870\nwhat if somebody just says you know,\nI want to play with virtual VM Ware.\n\n392\n00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:10.480\nOne of their free versions\nof some virtualization.\n\n393\n00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.600\nAnd they start creating some\nvirtual hard drives and\n\n394\n00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.240\nthey put them in their\nmy documents folder.\n\n395\n00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.630\nNow all of a sudden all that's getting\nstored up there on your file server and\n\n396\n00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:22.530\nthey could eat through your space really\nquick and it would not a be good day.\n\n397\n00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:26.820\nSo do some checks on that\nmake sure you're controlling\n\n398\n00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.530\nhow much space each user's allowed to use.\n\n399\n00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.510\nAnd possibly what types of files\nthey're allowed to put up there.\n\n400\n00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:35.720\nSo if you're unfamiliar with that make\nsure you check out our episodes on that\n\n401\n00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.650\nfile server resource manager where\nI can do both of those things.\n\n402\n00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.944\n>> Now Mike before we move on for the\nfolder redirection we really just did that\n\n403\n00:20:41.944 --> 00:20:44.600\none My Documents, but\nwhat about those other 12?\n\n404\n00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.640\nDo I have to do each one individually\nif I wanted every single one or\n\n405\n00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.320\nis there a way that I have one\nlocation let me do them all?\n\n406\n00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.110\n>> You can point them all\nto the same location but\n\n407\n00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.190\nyou do have to set the settings for\neach one.\n\n408\n00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:58.760\nLike if I go back in here and real quick\nwe'll take a peek at that if I edit this\n\n409\n00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:03.760\npolicy again I could go back\ninto user policies windows\n\n410\n00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.400\nfolder redirection and lets say we\nwanted to do their favorites right.\n\n411\n00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.657\nWe can see that this one is not configured\nso I have to go through the same process,\n\n412\n00:21:11.657 --> 00:21:13.159\neveryone what have you, and\n\n413\n00:21:13.159 --> 00:21:17.250\nthen I would just choose that if I wanted\nto I would choose that same location.\n\n414\n00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.820\nI could do svr01\\ what did I call it,\ndocs.\n\n415\n00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:25.580\nAnd you'll see it's gonna\nreuse that Rob subfolder,\n\n416\n00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.590\njust create another one called Favorites.\n\n417\n00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.970\nSame settings are available here.\n\n418\n00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:32.350\nI'm going to click okay.\n\n419\n00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:35.680\nAnd yes, because it's not going to apply\nto the older downlevel operating systems.\n\n420\n00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.640\nSo now, if we go back over to data.\n\n421\n00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.070\nWell, I won't do it until\nRob actually logs on.\n\n422\n00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.390\nSo you could redirect their\ndocuments to one server, and\n\n423\n00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:47.610\ntheir favorites to a different\nserver if you wanted to.\n\n424\n00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.690\nOr you could just use that same path and\nit'll create sub folders.\n\n425\n00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.370\nThere's a folder for Rob.\n\n426\n00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.760\nAnd then there's a folder for\ndocuments and a folder for favorites.\n\n427\n00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.400\nAnd there will be a folder for Ronnie,\nand then documents and favorites.\n\n428\n00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.650\nAnd if I chose to add desktop to that\nlater then underneath Rob we'd create\n\n429\n00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:04.370\nanother folder called desktop.\n\n430\n00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:07.510\nAnd underneath Ronnie we'd create\nanother folder called desktop.\n\n431\n00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:10.200\nSo you can definitely reuse\nthat same path, great question.\n\n432\n00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.490\n>> Excellent.\n\n433\n00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.630\n>> All right next thing I wanna take\na look at another common thing for\n\n434\n00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:18.000\nworking with the user\nenvironment is scripts.\n\n435\n00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.960\nNow we don't use scripts as much anymore,\nbecause there are some cool\n\n436\n00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.805\nthings we can do with those group policy\npreferences we've been talking about.\n\n437\n00:22:27.805 --> 00:22:30.075\nBut scripts can still be used.\n\n438\n00:22:30.075 --> 00:22:34.265\nThey were originally used when we\ndidnt' have policy preferences.\n\n439\n00:22:34.265 --> 00:22:36.855\nThere were some things that couldn't\ndo group policies, like mapping and\n\n440\n00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:38.385\nnetwork drive was a big one.\n\n441\n00:22:38.385 --> 00:22:40.695\nPushing out printers was a big one.\n\n442\n00:22:40.695 --> 00:22:43.350\nNowadays we can use\npreferences to do all that.\n\n443\n00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.910\nBut you still might have scripts.\n\n444\n00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:49.680\nAnd many companies will spend a lot of\ntime developing these log on scripts and\n\n445\n00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.060\nstart up scripts, and\nthey still want to implement them.\n\n446\n00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.560\nThey don't want to move\nto the preferences yet.\n\n447\n00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.010\nSo, scripts are still out there.\n\n448\n00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:59.830\nAnd the key to understand here, there's\nreally four times I can run scripts.\n\n449\n00:23:01.245 --> 00:23:05.120\nThey're under the computer half, and\nlet me just show you while I'm in here.\n\n450\n00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.940\nLet's do that ITPro standards policy here.\n\n451\n00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.500\nOr no, let's stick, we'll stick with\nthe developer's policy that I have.\n\n452\n00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.610\nWe'll say the developers I\nneed to map them a drive.\n\n453\n00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:18.040\nSo I'm gonna right click on this guy and\nchoose edit.\n\n454\n00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:23.270\nAnd in this policy under\nthe computer half,\n\n455\n00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:28.820\nWindows settings, I've got scripts,\nstart up and shut down.\n\n456\n00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.790\nSo, a script that I put here could\nexecute when this computer starts up.\n\n457\n00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.760\nOr when this computer shuts down.\n\n458\n00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.730\nCommon use for this might be,\n\n459\n00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:41.730\nlike I've used shut down scripts to\nclean up temp files things like that.\n\n460\n00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:45.510\nOr start up scripts to set profile,\nyeah or not profile locations, but\n\n461\n00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:50.140\nto do something to that machine\nevery time it boots up.\n\n462\n00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.421\nBut keep in mind that's a machine setting.\n\n463\n00:23:52.421 --> 00:23:56.609\nWhich means it only applies\nwhen the machine starts up or\n\n464\n00:23:56.609 --> 00:23:59.381\nanytime during that refresh cycle.\n\n465\n00:23:59.381 --> 00:24:04.075\nUnder the user half, I also have scripts\nWe hear of log on and log off scripts and\n\n466\n00:24:04.075 --> 00:24:08.559\nthese I find a little more useful but\nagain, depending on your environment\n\n467\n00:24:08.559 --> 00:24:12.758\nyou might want something to happen\nevery time that machine starts up or\n\n468\n00:24:12.758 --> 00:24:16.740\nsomething to happen every\ntime that machine shuts down.\n\n469\n00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.750\nThat's what those scripts are for.\n\n470\n00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:19.730\nLog on scripts,\n\n471\n00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:24.700\nlog off scripts, every time the user\nlogs on, every time the user logs off.\n\n472\n00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.530\nKeep in mind if you're doing the computer\nconfiguration with the startup and\n\n473\n00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:31.840\nshutdown scripts, that policy would\nhave to be scoped to the OU that\n\n474\n00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.750\ncontains the computer account,\nnot the user account.\n\n475\n00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:35.690\nRight?\n\n476\n00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.230\nI'll stick with the user account,\nthat'll be a little easier to test,\n\n477\n00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.390\nbecause we can simply log off and\nlog on to go check that out.\n\n478\n00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:45.540\nSo for users, I have log on, log off.\n\n479\n00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.580\nAnd out here in the details\narea I see my log on.\n\n480\n00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.290\nThe first thing I'm gonna need to do is,\n\n481\n00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:53.010\nI really need a script if\nwe're going to use a script.\n\n482\n00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:55.000\nSo let's write a script real quick.\n\n483\n00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.160\nWe'll just do a, we'll go in to ISE.\n\n484\n00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:02.300\nAnd for the script let's map a drive.\n\n485\n00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:07.510\nI remember my command here,\nRonnie, New-PSDrive and\n\n486\n00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:11.390\nwe'll give it a -Name.\n\n487\n00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.940\nOh, let's call it data or something.\n\n488\n00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.520\nOh I'm sorry that's gonna\nbe my drive letters.\n\n489\n00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:20.850\nLet's give it the letter S and\nthen we'll do a -Root and\n\n490\n00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:26.010\nwhat this is is where's that shared folder\nlocated at basically what the path is and\n\n491\n00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:34.210\nthat's gonna be //svr01/ and\nI've got a folder called data so\n\n492\n00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:40.020\nname, that's the letter that's gonna get\nmapped to this drive Root is the share.\n\n493\n00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.630\nWe got an extra space in there.\n\n494\n00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:42.840\nThat I'm trying to map to.\n\n495\n00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:49.280\nAnd then I can do a -Persistant if\nI want that to show up every time.\n\n496\n00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.770\nIf I don't do persistant,\nif they reboot the machine,\n\n497\n00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.540\nwell, it's kind of tricky then.\n\n498\n00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:58.857\nThe script would run when they log on but\nthey could remove it or\n\n499\n00:25:58.857 --> 00:26:02.240\nit could disappear on them every time.\n\n500\n00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.928\nAnd then the, what was the last one?\n\n501\n00:26:03.928 --> 00:26:08.120\n-Psprovider and\nthis is gonna be file system.\n\n502\n00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.928\nThere's a file system share\nthat I'm trying to map.\n\n503\n00:26:10.928 --> 00:26:15.890\nThe psdrive does a little bit more than\njust mapping drives, and you could just\n\n504\n00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:20.720\nas well use a command, like a CMD or\na batfile, where you use our old net use.\n\n505\n00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:25.295\nTo map a drive that way would work just\nfine, so I'm gonna save this guy, and\n\n506\n00:26:25.295 --> 00:26:28.170\nI'm gonna dump it right\nthere in my documents.\n\n507\n00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:29.539\nThat's fine.\n\n508\n00:26:29.539 --> 00:26:33.819\nI'll call it map data drive.\n\n509\n00:26:35.642 --> 00:26:37.160\nAnd I'll click save.\n\n510\n00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.230\nSo now I've got this script.\n\n511\n00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:40.710\nAll right.\nThat should map that drive.\n\n512\n00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:45.490\nNow what I want to do is I want it to run\nwhen that user logs on, anybody in that\n\n513\n00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:49.630\ndevo you cuz that's where all my dev\ntools are or something like that.\n\n514\n00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:52.330\nSo I come in to log on and\nI'm going to double click on it or\n\n515\n00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:53.860\nright click properties.\n\n516\n00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:57.632\nAnd you see I've got two tabs, one for\nscripts and one for power shell scripts.\n\n517\n00:26:57.632 --> 00:27:00.908\nAll right so it's just depending,\nif you're doing a .bat or\n\n518\n00:27:00.908 --> 00:27:02.360\n.cnd you'd do that here.\n\n519\n00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:08.080\nIf you're doing PowerShell scripts,\nyou would do that here, all right?\n\n520\n00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:12.240\nPowerShell requires 7 or 2008,\nWindows 7, 2008, or higher, right?\n\n521\n00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:13.980\nAll right, so\n\n522\n00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.090\nthe first thing we've gotta do is\nwe've gotta add the script to the GPO.\n\n523\n00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:19.890\nWe gotta tell it what scripts to run.\n\n524\n00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:23.250\nSo we can click Add, but\nit's not gonna have any scripts.\n\n525\n00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:25.940\nIf I go to Browse,\nit doesn't show anything and\n\n526\n00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.680\nI'll show you where that's\nbrowsing to in just a second.\n\n527\n00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:33.710\nSo what I want to do is I want to\nadd it to the GPO itself and for\n\n528\n00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:37.200\nthat, we click this show\nfiles down at the bottom.\n\n529\n00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:42.970\nNow, take a look at where this\nopened up if I can show you that.\n\n530\n00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:44.700\nNot easily,\nlet's make that a little bit bigger.\n\n531\n00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:47.450\nScroll over there we go.\n\n532\n00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:52.220\nYou can see when I clicked on Show Files,\nit opened up a location backslash\n\n533\n00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:57.120\nbackslash lab it pro tv sys\nval my domain policies.\n\n534\n00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.350\nThe goo id for\nthis particular policy that I'm editing.\n\n535\n00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:02.870\nUser, scripts, log on.\n\n536\n00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:03.700\nAll right?\n\n537\n00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:08.150\nSo what I'm doing is I'm saying I want\nto store this script In the GPO itself.\n\n538\n00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:10.090\nAnd it's gonna put it in sysvol.\n\n539\n00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:13.250\nRemember, sysvol replicates to\nall my other domain controllers.\n\n540\n00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:15.250\nI could simply browse to the script.\n\n541\n00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.780\nIf I didn't add it here,\nthat first button I clicked,\n\n542\n00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:21.570\nI could've browsed to My Documents, and\nsaid, this is the script I wanna run.\n\n543\n00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:25.330\nBut when that policy deploys out\nto other users on their systems,\n\n544\n00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:26.980\nYou're not going to be\nable to find that script.\n\n545\n00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.150\nThey have permissions to reach\nout across the networks and\n\n546\n00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:34.590\nget into my mydocuments on my machine\nthat I'm running that on, no.\n\n547\n00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:35.160\nRight?\nSo\n\n548\n00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.230\nI want to make sure that I include\nthe script in the GPO itself.\n\n549\n00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.830\nRight?\n\n550\n00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.780\nSo that's what I'm doing\nhere by adding that.\n\n551\n00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:46.510\nSo you're,\nall I'm going to do is copy that script.\n\n552\n00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:53.181\nI'm gonna go over to my documents and\nI'm gonna copy that script.\n\n553\n00:28:53.181 --> 00:28:58.672\nAnd I'm gonna paste it into\nthat user scripts logon.\n\n554\n00:28:58.672 --> 00:28:59.832\nPaste.\n\n555\n00:28:59.832 --> 00:29:04.025\nAll right now if I go back out to the GPO\nitself you'll see there's machine\n\n556\n00:29:04.025 --> 00:29:05.020\nand user.\n\n557\n00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.590\nMachine has scripts start up and\nshut down.\n\n558\n00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.400\nIf I go back out to that policy and\n\n559\n00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:14.800\ngo under user I've got scripts,\nlog on and log off.\n\n560\n00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.440\nAnd if I go under log\non there's my script.\n\n561\n00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:23.364\nSo then I'm simply going to close this\nbrowser window and now when I click\n\n562\n00:29:23.364 --> 00:29:28.353\nadd and browse, there's my policy,\nor there's my script, I'm sorry.\n\n563\n00:29:28.353 --> 00:29:31.003\nSo it's automatically\nbrowsing to that location,\n\n564\n00:29:31.003 --> 00:29:33.240\nthat's storage location within that GPO.\n\n565\n00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.640\nYou could have several scripts, and\nI'm just going to click ok to that,\n\n566\n00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.500\nloaded up in the show files.\n\n567\n00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.000\nAll right.\n\n568\n00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.660\nI could go to show files and\nI could paste 20 scripts in here.\n\n569\n00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:49.520\nThen when I go and click Add,\nI would see all 20 of those scripts.\n\n570\n00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.610\nJust because they show there does\nnot mean they're gonna execute.\n\n571\n00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:56.800\nOnly what I actually add to\nthis list is going to run.\n\n572\n00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.010\nSo it gets a little bit confusing.\n\n573\n00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:59.680\nYou got a couple steps we did there.\n\n574\n00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:03.360\nWe copied the script itself into the GPO,\nbut\n\n575\n00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.470\nthen we have to tell the GPO,\nwe want to run this particular script.\n\n576\n00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:09.840\nAll right.\nSo kind of two steps we did there.\n\n577\n00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.670\nAll right, so\nwe've got that script stored in that GPO.\n\n578\n00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.970\nSo when that user logs on it\nshould run that script and\n\n579\n00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:17.930\nthat's going to map that drive.\n\n580\n00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:20.470\nBut one little cavy I don't\nwant to teach you guys about.\n\n581\n00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.640\nAnd this came about in Windows 8.1.\n\n582\n00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.970\nWhat Microsoft did was they,\nI'll back up just a little bit.\n\n583\n00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.040\nWhat's going to happen if you\nstart playing around with this.\n\n584\n00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.480\nAnd you're like, I want to try this.\n\n585\n00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.100\nI want to create this log on script.\n\n586\n00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.780\nAnd you're going to create your script.\n\n587\n00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.510\nYou put it into the GPO,\njust like we did here.\n\n588\n00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.770\nYou go to log on as that user.\n\n589\n00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:38.850\nNothing happens.\n\n590\n00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.450\nAnd so you start banging\nyour head against the desk,\n\n591\n00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:42.780\ngoing why isn't this thing running?\n\n592\n00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.610\nWell starting with Windows 8.1,\n\n593\n00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:48.260\nMicrosoft has a built-in\ndelay on these logon scripts.\n\n594\n00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:52.710\nAnd they did that because they wanted to\nreduce the tension during that logon time.\n\n595\n00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:54.330\nThere's a lot of things happening.\n\n596\n00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:57.950\nPauses being applied, and\nif they thought it would speed up, or\n\n597\n00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.490\nit will speed up the log on process\n\n598\n00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:03.980\nif they just push the execution\nof the scripts back a little bit.\n\n599\n00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:07.500\nLet everything else finish up,\nand then the scripts can execute.\n\n600\n00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.390\nThe problem is, if we don't know that's\nthere, we might not wait five minutes.\n\n601\n00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:12.430\nWe log on.\n\n602\n00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.710\nIt's not there and\nwe start our troubleshooting.\n\n603\n00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:16.210\nWe're banging our heads.\n\n604\n00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:20.210\nThe truth is if you just waited five\nminutes it would actually kick in.\n\n605\n00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:22.100\nSo something that I want\nyou to be aware of and\n\n606\n00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:26.060\nif you need it to kick in faster than\nthat, you can change that setting.\n\n607\n00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:28.510\nSo what I'm going to do,\nis I'm going to close this policy.\n\n608\n00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:32.990\nThe setting is actually a computer\nsetting that controls that delay.\n\n609\n00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:38.350\nAnd so I, this policy was linked to the OU\nwhere the developers user accounts are.\n\n610\n00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:40.670\nThose were your user settings,\nand that's fine.\n\n611\n00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:44.480\nBut to affect that delay I need to go to\nthe OU where the computers are located.\n\n612\n00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.510\nBecause it's a computer setting.\n\n613\n00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:50.780\nSo I'm going to go up to my clients OU,\nand I'll do this for all my clients.\n\n614\n00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:54.201\nAnd so I'm gonna right-click there and\nchoose Create a GPO and link it here.\n\n615\n00:31:54.201 --> 00:32:01.641\nAnd I'll call it\nRemove Logon Script Delay.\n\n616\n00:32:01.641 --> 00:32:03.581\nAnd I'll click Okay.\n\n617\n00:32:03.581 --> 00:32:07.001\nAnd then I am gonna edit that policy.\n\n618\n00:32:07.001 --> 00:32:12.997\nAnd that setting we're looking for\nis gonna be under Computer Configuration,\n\n619\n00:32:12.997 --> 00:32:16.131\nPolicies, Administrative Templates,\n\n620\n00:32:16.131 --> 00:32:20.840\nSystem, Group Policies,\nburied way down in there.\n\n621\n00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:26.230\nAnd then there is a setting called\nConfigure Logon Script Delay.\n\n622\n00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:29.696\nAnd all I have to do is\nchoose to turn that on, and\n\n623\n00:32:29.696 --> 00:32:34.140\nthen I can change that to say,\na 0, if I want no delay at all.\n\n624\n00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.012\nOr like I said, it's anything,\nI think they'll give you up to,\n\n625\n00:32:37.012 --> 00:32:39.589\nthis is done in minutes,\nand the max would be 1,000.\n\n626\n00:32:39.589 --> 00:32:42.070\nI don't know why you'd want\nto delay it 1000 minutes.\n\n627\n00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:44.300\nBut I just wanted you\nguys to be aware of this,\n\n628\n00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.970\nbecause you might have,\nin your environment you might have\n\n629\n00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:50.860\nseveral log on scripts that you rely\non to setup that user environment.\n\n630\n00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:54.720\nAnd all of a sudden you upgrade to Windows\n8.1, and your log on scripts seem to fail,\n\n631\n00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.420\nbut if you wait long enough\nthey will kick in, but\n\n632\n00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.270\nmaybe I don't want that wait, right?\n\n633\n00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:00.290\nSo that's what this is for.\n\n634\n00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.740\nSo I click OK, and now that's turned on.\n\n635\n00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.415\nThere should no longer be a delay,\nso we'll go restart that machine.\n\n636\n00:33:07.415 --> 00:33:10.277\nIt is a computer setting, so\n\n637\n00:33:10.277 --> 00:33:15.060\nI do have to Restart,\nto get that guy to kick in.\n\n638\n00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.490\nI think what you were saying earlier,\nyou might have I know several environments\n\n639\n00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:21.980\nwhere they've got lots of scripts that\nthey run to set up that user environment.\n\n640\n00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.020\nAnd all of a sudden they upgrade it,\nand things seem to be broke.\n\n641\n00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.990\nThey got users calling up,\nwhere's my map drives?\n\n642\n00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.780\nWhere's my printers?\n\n643\n00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:28.340\nWhere's my?\n\n644\n00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.535\nThey can't connect to a file server,\n\n645\n00:33:30.535 --> 00:33:33.540\ncuz you've got an IP seg policy,\nthat's supposed to be kicking in.\n\n646\n00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.220\nAnd if you'd wait long enough,\nit would actually work.\n\n647\n00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.842\nBut users aren't gonna wait that long.\n\n648\n00:33:38.842 --> 00:33:41.430\nThey're gonna see that it's not working,\nand within the first 30 seconds,\n\n649\n00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:43.410\nthey're going to call the help desk.\n\n650\n00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.720\nSo I'm not a huge fan of that delay.\n\n651\n00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:49.280\nBut If you're having delayed log on times,\n\n652\n00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.230\nbecause of the scripts,\nmaybe that delay is right for you.\n\n653\n00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:56.350\nSo we'll go ahead and\nlog in as Rob here, and see what we get.\n\n654\n00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.370\nSo we should, again, no delay, that means\nthat script should execute immediately\n\n655\n00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:06.580\ninstead of waiting five minutes,\nwe'll flip over to File Explorer.\n\n656\n00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:13.590\nAnd, sure enough, there is my mapped drive\nfor that data drive, on that file server.\n\n657\n00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:16.200\nSo again,\ncool things you can do with logon scripts.\n\n658\n00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:20.365\nYou can run things when you get the logon\nscripts, and you got log off scripts.\n\n659\n00:34:20.365 --> 00:34:23.405\nMaybe when they log off,\nI wanna clean up all their temp files.\n\n660\n00:34:23.405 --> 00:34:27.025\nGreat thing to do on public computers,\nwhere I've got shared access.\n\n661\n00:34:27.025 --> 00:34:30.365\nI don't want the next person that sits\ndown at that machine at my kiosk,\n\n662\n00:34:30.365 --> 00:34:34.535\nto see the previous person's Internet\nhistory or things like that.\n\n663\n00:34:34.535 --> 00:34:38.215\nSo, maybe every time somebody logs off,\nI wanna clean up temp files.\n\n664\n00:34:38.215 --> 00:34:40.015\nYou got start up and shut down scripts.\n\n665\n00:34:40.015 --> 00:34:42.920\nWhen the computer starts up,\nwhen the computer shuts down.\n\n666\n00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:47.940\nJust keep in mind that with Windows if,\none, copy the scripts into the GPO first,\n\n667\n00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:51.100\notherwise they won't be able to\nretrieve the script to run it.\n\n668\n00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.608\nAnd two, don't forget about that delay.\n\n669\n00:34:53.608 --> 00:34:57.320\nIf you're okay with a five minute delay,\nthat's fine, but you can do away with it,\n\n670\n00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.130\nthere's that setting under\nthe Computer Configuration\n\n671\n00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:03.310\nthat can remove that delay and\nhave those scripts executed immediately.\n\n672\n00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:07.790\n>> Now Mike, you know that clearly setting\nthat up actually seems like a great idea\n\n673\n00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:09.460\nfor us to be able to run those scripts.\n\n674\n00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:12.200\nThe thing that Mike showed you right\naway is something that he caught,\n\n675\n00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.690\nwhich is something I normally don't catch,\nis I put\n\n676\n00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:17.310\nthe computer setting into the user's\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n677\n00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:19.490\n>> Setting side instead, or\n\n678\n00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:22.320\ninto the GPO,\nwhich doesn't have that computer account.\n\n679\n00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.630\nAnd when stuff like that happens,\nI know it doesn't run.\n\n680\n00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:26.780\nI've done that before with just\nterminal servers wondering,\n\n681\n00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.060\nwhy in the world this isn't actually\nworking, and its because I had set it for\n\n682\n00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.120\njust that user where I'd get the OU for\nthe users.\n\n683\n00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.320\n>> Yeah it's a great one,\nRonnie,it's an easy mistake.\n\n684\n00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.340\nI do it myself, you might be editing this\npolicy and you put that script in there,\n\n685\n00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:44.110\nyou think, oh well I need that\nscript to run immediately.\n\n686\n00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:47.790\nSo you just go up to the computer half,\nand you configure that setting.\n\n687\n00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:50.897\nThe problem is the computer account,\nisn't in that OU, right.\n\n688\n00:35:50.897 --> 00:35:55.230\nSo you use separate policies linked to\nthe computers OU, and you're good to go.\n\n689\n00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:56.270\n>> Excellent Mike.\n\n690\n00:35:56.270 --> 00:36:00.960\nThat's a lot of great ways to actually\nhelp us use the policies that we have\n\n691\n00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:05.480\nthere, inside of Group Policy,\nto effectively affect the user, right?\n\n692\n00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.705\nBy being able to do this we can\ncontrol what the user actually does,\n\n693\n00:36:08.705 --> 00:36:11.730\na lot of times even without\nthem needing to know about it.\n\n694\n00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.620\nIt makes the uniformity for\nall of our users.\n\n695\n00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:17.710\nIt gives us the ability to set\nthe controls that we need in place,\n\n696\n00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:20.960\nby putting these types of scripts\nthat Mike was talking about, right?\n\n697\n00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.700\nWe actually are now able to control\nwhen they're actually going to run, and\n\n698\n00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.570\ninstead of depending on every\nindividual user to go, please,\n\n699\n00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:29.090\ndid you make sure you ran that?\n\n700\n00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:29.660\nOh, I forgot.\n\n701\n00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.960\nAnd then they have to run it and they're\nlike when was I supposed to run that?\n\n702\n00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.420\nAnd you just go never mind.\n\n703\n00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.475\nSetting new script up helps us to\nbe able to automate even that,\n\n704\n00:36:37.475 --> 00:36:41.650\na little bit more and gives us much\nbetter control by using Group Policy.\n\n705\n00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:44.350\nSo thank you again, Mike, for\nthat demonstration, great and\n\n706\n00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:46.140\neffective demonstration to help us.\n\n707\n00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.800\nThank you, also, for\nwatching us here on ITProTV.\n\n708\n00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.110\nSigning off I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n709\n00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:52.150\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n710\n00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:53.935\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n711\n00:36:53.935 -->

00:00:16.690\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.310\nAnd today we're gonna be\nworking with group policy.\n\n5\n00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.330\nWe're specifically gonna be looking at\ncreating audit policies to help us out.\n\n6\n00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.240\nWe really do need to\ntrack things like well,\n\n7\n00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.400\naccount audit events that\nwe have to be able to do.\n\n8\n00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.980\nAnd who better to help us than Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.480\nMike, when we start talking about creating\nan audit policy, let's go ahead and\n\n10\n00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.060\nanswer the question, why do I really\ncare about auditing these things?\n\n11\n00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.350\nAnd what else do we need\nto know about them?\n\n12\n00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.040\n>> Well probably a lot, but\nthe very basic question is a great one.\n\n13\n00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.940\nWhy do we have to audit, why do we care?\n\n14\n00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.340\nWell, a couple of reasons, right.\n\n15\n00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.850\nOne it could be because simply as\nan organization, I need to track things.\n\n16\n00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.960\nI need to know who's\nmaking those new files?\n\n17\n00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.540\nWho's modifying those existing files?\n\n18\n00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.600\nWho's making new accounts\nin active directory?\n\n19\n00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.112\nWho's making changes to group policies,\nright?\n\n20\n00:01:03.112 --> 00:01:05.670\nThose kinda things we can track that,\nwe can find out.\n\n21\n00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.667\nI wanna come in a go,\nhey there's a new policy here.\n\n22\n00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:11.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's blocking everybody from x, y, z.\n\n23\n00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.480\nWhere the heck did it come from?\n\n24\n00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.240\nWho made it?\nRight?\n\n25\n00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.160\nOr why is this policy not working?\n\n26\n00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.890\nOr somebody changed something,\nor who deleted Ronie's account?\n\n27\n00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.530\nRight.\nRonnie comes into work one day\n\n28\n00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.980\ncan't log in to do some research.\n\n29\n00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.460\nAnd his account's gone.\n\n30\n00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.000\nWhere the heck did it go?\n\n31\n00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.900\nWho did it?\n\n32\n00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.250\nI need to track those kinda things.\n\n33\n00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.950\nRight?\nA logon events.\n\n34\n00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.710\nI need to be able to track\nwhen people are logging on or\n\n35\n00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.950\nthose strange log on attempts that\nare occurring 2 o'clock in the morning,\n\n36\n00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.940\nwhen nobody's supposed\nto be in the building.\n\n37\n00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.460\nI wanna be able to track that kinda stuff.\n\n38\n00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.120\nThat's exactly what we do\nwith our audit policies.\n\n39\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.060\nSecond is it might be required, right?\n\n40\n00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.910\nIf you're a company or an organization\nthat falls under any of those\n\n41\n00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.430\ngovernmental regulations or\nindustry regulations,\n\n42\n00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.740\nlike HIPAA, or Sarbanes Oxley, or\nanything like that, you have to track.\n\n43\n00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.490\nThere's a governmental\nregulation that says\n\n44\n00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.140\nyou need to be able to prove who access\nthese records, when they were changed,\n\n45\n00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.810\nwhy they were changed,\nyou know all that stuff.\n\n46\n00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.590\nIt could be just that your organization\nwants to do it just because they wanna\n\n47\n00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.270\nkeep track, or it could be you've got\na requirement that you could be audited\n\n48\n00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.710\nas an organization and you've gotta\nproduce all of this information.\n\n49\n00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.540\nYou've gotta produce a track record of how\nthose patient records were kept safe and\n\n50\n00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.350\nthat nobody accessed them without\nauthorization and things like that.\n\n51\n00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.210\nSo lots of reasons in\nthe end that we wanna audit.\n\n52\n00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.980\n>> So when we talk about the audit\npolicies that we're gonna be taking a look\n\n53\n00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.680\nat today it really is about the idea of\naccessing maybe what you're talking about,\n\n54\n00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.230\na particular file and\nchanging or permissions.\n\n55\n00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.730\nAs well as the account log on or\njust the individual log on as well.\n\n56\n00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.990\nAnd those are great examples for\n\n57\n00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.420\nus because that's what we're usually\nwhat we're really looking for.\n\n58\n00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.800\nDid somebody access something\nthey weren't suppose to?\n\n59\n00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.670\nIs somebody actually logging in let's\nsay at times that they're also not\n\n60\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.770\nsuppose as well.\n\n61\n00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.710\nBy creating these things,\nwe really begin to set this in place.\n\n62\n00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.310\nWe're starting to see the power of a group\npolicy, especially in helping us to\n\n63\n00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.010\nidentify who's doing it,\nat what particular point in time, and\n\n64\n00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.250\nmaybe in how often we're actually starting\nto see this stuff, which may actually\n\n65\n00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.930\nindicate, well even other types\nof attacks that may be going on.\n\n66\n00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.450\n>> Yeah.\n>> So Mike,\n\n67\n00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.820\nwhere do we need to begin when we\nstart taking a look at these policies.\n\n68\n00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.040\n>> We're gonna start here\nlooking at our group policies.\n\n69\n00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.940\nFirst thing I wanna show you\nis the different categories.\n\n70\n00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.660\nAnd as Ronnie said,\nnow there's a lot of different things,\n\n71\n00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.390\nwe're gonna focus on a couple of them.\n\n72\n00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.890\nMainly because they're very common ones\nthat most organizations wanna implement\n\n73\n00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.580\nas basic auditing.\n\n74\n00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.700\nAnd two they all work\npretty much the same,\n\n75\n00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.960\nyou just have to figure out what\ncategory it is that you wanna work with.\n\n76\n00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.350\nSo let me show you what I mean here.\n\n77\n00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.740\nI'm gonna open up my\nGroup Policy Management console, and\n\n78\n00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.800\nI'm gonna grab any policy for right now.\n\n79\n00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.580\nJust so we can look at the these settings,\nand then we'll work our way from there.\n\n80\n00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.530\nSo here I've right clicked on that policy,\nand I chose Edit.\n\n81\n00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.367\nAnd my settings are gonna be under\nthe Computer Configuration Policies.\n\n82\n00:03:57.367 --> 00:04:00.056\nWindows Settings.\n\n83\n00:04:00.056 --> 00:04:02.924\nSecurity Settings.\n\n84\n00:04:02.924 --> 00:04:04.900\nLocal policy.\n\n85\n00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.810\nAnd then audit policy.\n\n86\n00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.560\nAll right.\n\n87\n00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.095\nThese nine, I think there is\nnine if I remember correctly.\n\n88\n00:04:10.095 --> 00:04:15.015\nYeah, these nine categories are the\noriginal audit categories that we've had\n\n89\n00:04:15.015 --> 00:04:16.755\nall the way back to Windows Server 2000,\n\n90\n00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:20.395\nand most of them are pretty\nstraightforward.\n\n91\n00:04:20.395 --> 00:04:25.200\nThe account log on and the log on\nevents can be a little bit confusing.\n\n92\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.800\nI'll go back and\nhit those in just a second.\n\n93\n00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.130\nAccount management.\n\n94\n00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.250\nI need to know when somebody's deleting\na user account, active directory.\n\n95\n00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.960\nOr changing a password or\nupdating a value.\n\n96\n00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.430\nYou an attribute.\n\n97\n00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.440\nDirectory service access,\nagain maybe they're getting in there and\n\n98\n00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.560\nmaking new OUs or creating new groups.\n\n99\n00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.110\nSo anything in Active Directory.\n\n100\n00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.550\nObject access would be things\nlike files and folders.\n\n101\n00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.030\nPolicy change.\n\n102\n00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.300\nWho's making changes to the policies\nthemselves, or creating new ones, or\n\n103\n00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.065\nunlinking them?\n\n104\n00:04:55.065 --> 00:04:55.645\nRight?\n\n105\n00:04:55.645 --> 00:05:00.885\nSomebody might be, if they've gained\naccess somehow to group policy and\n\n106\n00:05:00.885 --> 00:05:05.447\nthey've unlinked the policy cuz\nthey didn't like what it did,\n\n107\n00:05:05.447 --> 00:05:09.210\nright or\nthey've made a change to a policy.\n\n108\n00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.084\nPrivilege use, well if you've ever\nused a right that was assigned to\n\n109\n00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:18.788\nyou like being able to change\nthe system time, or reboot a server,\n\n110\n00:05:18.788 --> 00:05:24.101\naudit process tracking, this one is\na lot of times useful for developers.\n\n111\n00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:29.035\nCuz I can track what a process reaches out\nand hits other resources like reaching out\n\n112\n00:05:29.035 --> 00:05:34.200\nand grabbing, I don't know, a reference to\na database maybe or something like that.\n\n113\n00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.490\nAnd then system events, things that\nare occurring on that system itself.\n\n114\n00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.488\nSo these are the main categories or the\nones, like I said, that we've always had.\n\n115\n00:05:42.488 --> 00:05:48.276\nBut they have added a few more and\nwhen I say a few I mean like 53.\n\n116\n00:05:48.276 --> 00:05:51.920\n[LAUGH] So if I scroll down a little\nbit further I can see this advanced\n\n117\n00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.900\naudit policy node.\n\n118\n00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.530\nNow I'll make it that a little wider so\nwe can see it a little easier.\n\n119\n00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.860\nI'll expand that out and\nthen expand out audit policies.\n\n120\n00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.140\nAnd you'll see there's a bunch\nof additional categories.\n\n121\n00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.850\nEach one of these being a category so\n\n122\n00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.460\naccount log on you can see now\nhas several more categories.\n\n123\n00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.520\nDetailed tracking so\nwe can do process creation and\n\n124\n00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.760\nprocess termination and RPC events.\n\n125\n00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.520\nLog on and log off has some extended or\nsome additional ones like\n\n126\n00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.060\nAudit account lockout, and I wanna\nknow when an account gets locked out.\n\n127\n00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.190\nRemember we talked about\nin a previous episode,\n\n128\n00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.970\nif I've got that set to 30 minutes\nwhere it automatically resets,\n\n129\n00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.760\na user can end up waiting 30 minutes and\nthen trying again,\n\n130\n00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.688\nand I would never know that the account\nwas locked in the first place.\n\n131\n00:06:34.688 --> 00:06:37.490\nMaybe I wanna know, and\nsomething like this would help me do that.\n\n132\n00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.380\nAnd so I'm not gonna read all these to\nyou, but you'll see that there are several\n\n133\n00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.310\nadditional categories that we can do,\nall right?\n\n134\n00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.250\nAnd then I'll stick with our basics for\nnow,\n\n135\n00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.380\nthose are the ones we're\ngonna play with in here.\n\n136\n00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:54.090\nLet's go back and further describe this\naccount log on event and the log on event.\n\n137\n00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.050\nCuz that's one that most people\nalways have a question with or\n\n138\n00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:02.270\nare not quite sure what the difference is,\ncuz they do look very similar.\n\n139\n00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.110\nAnd the short definition is,\nthe account logon event is\n\n140\n00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:12.580\ndone by the system that actually verifies\nthe account or does the authentication.\n\n141\n00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.740\nIn other words, if I login with the local\naccount, that local account is stored\n\n142\n00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.580\nin the local security account manager\non the machine I'm logging on to.\n\n143\n00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.620\nSo the account logon event,\nwould be recorded or\n\n144\n00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.310\nfired as I like to say\non my local machine.\n\n145\n00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.570\nIt's the machine that's doing\nthe authorization, or excuse me,\n\n146\n00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.730\nthe authentication.\n\n147\n00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.940\nIf I log in with a domain account,\nwhere's that account stored?\n\n148\n00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.380\nStored in active directory\namong the domain controller.\n\n149\n00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.830\nSo the account logon event is\nnot gonna occur on my machine.\n\n150\n00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.190\nEven though this is where I'm\nsitting when I'm logging on,\n\n151\n00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.260\nmy information's being\nsent across the network.\n\n152\n00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.711\nIt's the domain controller that's actually\ndoing the authorization, or excuse me,\n\n153\n00:07:52.711 --> 00:07:54.827\nI said that again, the authentication.\n\n154\n00:07:54.827 --> 00:07:58.170\nSo that's the machine that's gonna\nrecord the account logon event,\n\n155\n00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.000\nbecause he's the one that's.\n\n156\n00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.317\nActually, verifying the password.\n\n157\n00:08:01.317 --> 00:08:05.003\nSo, basically, account log on events\noccur on the machine that's actually\n\n158\n00:08:05.003 --> 00:08:09.610\ndoing the authentication, the one that's\nverifying the user name and password.\n\n159\n00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:13.990\nThe log on event occurs where\nyou're at where you log on.\n\n160\n00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.430\nSo, let's go back and\ntry that example again.\n\n161\n00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.150\nIn fact, I've got a little drawing here,\nI think we can try and do.\n\n162\n00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:24.380\nSo, if I log on to this machine\nright here, this one on the left.\n\n163\n00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:29.750\nA client machine with a local account that\nmeans it's stored in that local sam file.\n\n164\n00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.060\nSo, the logon event is\ngoing to occur here,\n\n165\n00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.210\nright, because that's where I\nwas sitting when I logged on.\n\n166\n00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.300\nThe account logon event\nis also gonna occur here,\n\n167\n00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.515\nbecause this is the machine\nthat's doing the authorization.\n\n168\n00:08:41.515 --> 00:08:44.118\nOkay, I said it a third time.\n\n169\n00:08:44.118 --> 00:08:45.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The authentication.\n\n170\n00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.870\nIf I log on with a domain account,\nhowever, the log on event still\n\n171\n00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:54.730\noccurs here because this is where I was\nwhen I was doing the authentication.\n\n172\n00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.310\nBut, the account log on event would\nbe recorded in the event viewer\n\n173\n00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:59.860\nover here on the domain controller.\n\n174\n00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.460\nBecause he's the one who's\nactually doing the authentication.\n\n175\n00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.070\nRight?\n\n176\n00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:07.550\nSo, when it comes time to audit,\nwhat am I trying to audit?\n\n177\n00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.930\nIf I wanna get account log-on events, I\ncan enable that on this domain controller.\n\n178\n00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.500\nI will not record any log-on events.\n\n179\n00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.040\nRight?\nBecause the log-on events\n\n180\n00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.120\naren't occurring on the domain controller\nunless I physically walk over to\n\n181\n00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.610\nthe domain controller,\nthen both the log-on event and\n\n182\n00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.880\nthe account log-on event\nwould occur there.\n\n183\n00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.260\nIf I make a policy that\naudits logon events, well,\n\n184\n00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.510\nif they logon with a domain account,\nI will see the logon event here but\n\n185\n00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.410\nI will not record the account logon event,\nall right.\n\n186\n00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.180\nYou gotta think about where the process\nis occurring that you're trying to audit,\n\n187\n00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.460\nand then you've gotta make sure you\nenable the policy on the right machine.\n\n188\n00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.280\nIf I set up an account logon event policy,\nbut I scope it to\n\n189\n00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.100\nthe clients, well it's gonna be empty if\nthey're logging on with domain accounts\n\n190\n00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.540\nbecause there are no accounts log on\nevents occurring on the client machines.\n\n191\n00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.960\nThey're all occurring on the domain\ncontroller as far as domain accounts go,\n\n192\n00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.230\nso that's the first thing, and\nthat's the big thing with those two,\n\n193\n00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.250\nis just think about where\nthe advantage is occurring and\n\n194\n00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.270\nthen that will help you decide where\nyou need to enable the auto policy.\n\n195\n00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.670\nAll right.\n\n196\n00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:11.760\nAll right, so let's go back over\nto my domain controller here, and\n\n197\n00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.600\nlet's take a look, why don't we audit,\nwe'll start with logon events.\n\n198\n00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.980\nI know, I'm gonna flip that around on us,\nRonnie, since we were talking about that.\n\n199\n00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:23.620\nSo, if I want to audit account logon\nevents, and I wanna get domain based\n\n200\n00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:28.120\naccounts, that means they're gonna be\noccurring on my domain controller.\n\n201\n00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.940\nRight, so what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go to my domain controller's OU.\n\n202\n00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.880\nBecause I know that I have a policy\nlinked to the domain controller's OU, and\n\n203\n00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.160\nreally that's what this is for.\n\n204\n00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.850\nThis is where my auditing settings are for\nmy domain controllers.\n\n205\n00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.310\nSo, I'm gonna edit that policy, and\n\n206\n00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:48.400\nI'm going to expand out\ncomputer configuration.\n\n207\n00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:52.620\nAnd then, Windows settings and\nwe'll probably see if in fact,\n\n208\n00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.660\nlet's just wait I'll\nsurprise you guys with it.\n\n209\n00:10:54.660 --> 00:11:00.820\nLocal policies, audit policy, and there\nis my account log on events, all right.\n\n210\n00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.910\nAnd if I wanna audit account logon events,\nI'll double click on it, and\n\n211\n00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.650\nI'll choose to define\nthese policy settings.\n\n212\n00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.190\nBut I've got one more\ndecision to make here.\n\n213\n00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.620\nI have success and failure.\n\n214\n00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.730\nThey are check marks which\nmeans I can do both.\n\n215\n00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.700\nI've got to decide what\nis it I need to see.\n\n216\n00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.670\nWhat do I need a record of?\n\n217\n00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.960\nAnd this is something that your\norganization is going to have\n\n218\n00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.780\nto try to decide, it is very important.\n\n219\n00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:29.260\nThat we come up with an audit policy,\nbecause logs can get big very fast.\n\n220\n00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.330\nRight?\nIf we're auditing too much stuff,\n\n221\n00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.050\nwe can generate tons of events.\n\n222\n00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.870\nIt's not that they're huge,\n\n223\n00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:39.225\nand they're gonna eat up all my\ndisk space, although they could.\n\n224\n00:11:39.225 --> 00:11:43.255\nIt's really more about the fact that\nI can't find the important stuff.\n\n225\n00:11:43.255 --> 00:11:47.245\nIf I have hundreds of thousands of\nevents and most of them are success.\n\n226\n00:11:47.245 --> 00:11:50.817\nI'm looking for that one failure,\nit's like the needle in a haystack right?\n\n227\n00:11:50.817 --> 00:11:52.697\nIt's really difficult to find.\n\n228\n00:11:52.697 --> 00:11:56.117\nSo, you have to figure out do you\nwant success or failure or both.\n\n229\n00:11:56.117 --> 00:11:59.967\nFor example, if I'm doing account\nlog on events, if I do just failure,\n\n230\n00:11:59.967 --> 00:12:02.937\nyou might think well I don't care\nwhen people successfully log on\n\n231\n00:12:02.937 --> 00:12:06.877\nbecause that happens everyday,\nall day long when people are logging on.\n\n232\n00:12:06.877 --> 00:12:08.600\nI just want to see the failures.\n\n233\n00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.430\nNow, that might make sense, it's\ndefinitely gonna limit the entries in your\n\n234\n00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:15.540\nlog file, but here's where you're\ngonna run into a problem with that.\n\n235\n00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.100\nWhat if I see a bunch of failures\n\n236\n00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.930\nat 1:30 in the morning when\nnobody's supposed to be there?\n\n237\n00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.830\nI see failed attempt, failed attempt,\nfailed attempt, failed attempt.\n\n238\n00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.720\nAll right, that's good my failure's\nworking, I'm not auditing success just\n\n239\n00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.680\nfailure then all of the sudden\nat 1:35 the failures stop.\n\n240\n00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:37.720\nDid the bad guy get scared and run away,\ngive up, or did he succeed in logging in?\n\n241\n00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.750\nHe finally guessed the right password.\n\n242\n00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.250\nBecause I'm not auditing success,\nI wouldn't know.\n\n243\n00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.410\nI would see the failures stop, but\n\n244\n00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:49.500\nI don't see the next one was\nactually a successful logon attempt.\n\n245\n00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.210\nSo, that's what I'm saying,\n\n246\n00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.620\nwhen you're coming up with these policies\nyou really have to decide what it is\n\n247\n00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:58.590\nyou need to record, and think about how\nmany events are going to get generated.\n\n248\n00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:04.830\nSo, I'll go ahead and do just success and\nfailure, and I'll click OK on that.\n\n249\n00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.460\nAnd now, I'm gonna be auditing\naccount logon events.\n\n250\n00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.170\nNow, when you audit, they're all\ngonna go into the security log.\n\n251\n00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.710\nThe security log in your event viewer\nsystem is where auditing events go.\n\n252\n00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:18.150\nI'm gonna close this, Ronnie.\n\n253\n00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:22.150\nAnd I'm going to refresh policy\nhere on the domain controller.\n\n254\n00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.150\nThat policy was linked\nto my domain controller.\n\n255\n00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.570\nAnd I could reboot but\nI don't wanna reboot my domain controller.\n\n256\n00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.320\nSo, I'm do a little GP update.\n\n257\n00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.090\nSwitch forced to refresh\npolicy to let him know, hey,\n\n258\n00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.820\nyou're now supposed to audit\naccount log on events.\n\n259\n00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.850\nAnd once that finishes updating,\nwe'll flip over to a client here.\n\n260\n00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:41.490\nWe'll log on and see what happens.\n\n261\n00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.710\nThere we go.\n\n262\n00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.730\nI'll log on as Rob again.\n\n263\n00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.890\nOops.\nForgot Rob changed his password.\n\n264\n00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.810\nAll right, so now I am logging on.\n\n265\n00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:59.540\nWe'll switch over to the domain controller\nand we will open up that event viewer.\n\n266\n00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.450\nAnd we'll expand our windows logs,\nand then go that security log.\n\n267\n00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.540\nAnd let's see if we can find it here,\nthat'll be the question.\n\n268\n00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.331\nIs which one is it?\n\n269\n00:14:15.016 --> 00:14:17.000\nLet me get that guy open.\n\n270\n00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.652\nThat was on DC one,\nthat is not going to be him.\n\n271\n00:14:22.916 --> 00:14:24.450\nI don't see it.\n\n272\n00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:28.520\nIt looks like that was me logging on here.\n\n273\n00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.580\nAnd eventually, oops,\nthere's one for client one.\n\n274\n00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:38.445\nAnd let's find that username in here,\nif we can.\n\n275\n00:14:41.307 --> 00:14:44.144\nIt doesn't want to give me it in that one,\nbut anyway, as long as, I mean,\n\n276\n00:14:44.144 --> 00:14:45.860\nif I go through, there's LabRob.\n\n277\n00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.280\nSometimes, just finding\nthe event can be a challenge.\n\n278\n00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.960\nEvent Viewer has some great filtering\ncapabilities we wanted to dive into that,\n\n279\n00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.350\nmaybe we'll save that for another episode.\n\n280\n00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:59.040\nBut there you could see,\nLABrob logged on, and that's his account.\n\n281\n00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.280\nSo, actually, that was when he logged off.\n\n282\n00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.370\nAn account was successfully logged on,\n\n283\n00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:08.320\nthere's when the account was logged off,\na client O1.\n\n284\n00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:12.590\nSo, by choosing to audit those, those\nare now going to show up in my event log.\n\n285\n00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.810\nThe other thing a couple things\nto keep in mind with these logs.\n\n286\n00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:19.190\nThey don't refresh automatically,\nso I just did a refresh and\n\n287\n00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.140\nnow I see another logon event.\n\n288\n00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:24.920\nLet's go check that one here really quick,\nboy,\n\n289\n00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.540\nthese things are getting longer and\nlonger.\n\n290\n00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:31.130\nThat's mostly information, same computer.\n\n291\n00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:35.993\nThat was the DC, so yeah, and again, I\ndon't want to dive into the filtering, but\n\n292\n00:15:35.993 --> 00:15:40.325\nnow we can see that those logon events\nare going to be recorded over there.\n\n293\n00:15:40.325 --> 00:15:41.352\nWhat else was I gonna say?\n\n294\n00:15:41.352 --> 00:15:44.423\nAgain it always goes\ninto that security log.\n\n295\n00:15:44.423 --> 00:15:48.471\nOh, and with the account log and\nevents, another thing to keep in mind.\n\n296\n00:15:48.471 --> 00:15:51.954\nTypically I have more than\none domain controller, right?\n\n297\n00:15:51.954 --> 00:15:56.181\nAnd when you log on, you query DNS for the\nIP address of your domain controllers and\n\n298\n00:15:56.181 --> 00:15:58.447\nyou've picked the first one in the list,\nor\n\n299\n00:15:58.447 --> 00:16:01.892\nif you have sites turned off then\nyou pick one that's in your site.\n\n300\n00:16:01.892 --> 00:16:05.112\nBut you don't know which domain\ncontroller the user is going to actually\n\n301\n00:16:05.112 --> 00:16:06.074\nauthenticate with.\n\n302\n00:16:06.074 --> 00:16:09.049\nSo, if you really want to get all\nof your account login events,\n\n303\n00:16:09.049 --> 00:16:11.880\nyou have to do this on all\ndomain controllers, right?\n\n304\n00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.110\nIf you do it on one domain controller but\n\n305\n00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:16.180\nnot the other, you're going to get\nabout half your logons, right?\n\n306\n00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.810\nOr your account logon events.\n\n307\n00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:21.330\nSomething to keep in mind, it's why I\nlike using that policy that's linked to\n\n308\n00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:25.610\nthe domain controllers because that\nwould apply to all domain controllers.\n\n309\n00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.920\nAll right, so\nhow about some object access.\n\n310\n00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.580\nWhat do you think Ronnie?\n\n311\n00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.960\n>> I think, that's a great place for\nus to go ahead and start, sure.\n\n312\n00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.460\n>> All right, let's take a look at that.\n\n313\n00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.058\nObject access like files and\nfolders, right?\n\n314\n00:16:36.058 --> 00:16:40.060\nAnother very common thing to\naudit in most organizations.\n\n315\n00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.230\nEspecially, if you've got some type of\nindustry or governmental regulation\n\n316\n00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.860\nthat could dictate that you have to\nkeep track of this stuff, right?\n\n317\n00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.090\nSo, same lines.\n\n318\n00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.800\nWe've got to create a policy and\ndetermine what it is we want to audit.\n\n319\n00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.280\nWe're going to have success and failure.\n\n320\n00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.940\nOne thing we want to be\ncareful with here is,\n\n321\n00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:01.840\nwe can generate a lot of events,\nall right?\n\n322\n00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.210\nOne of those new categories is\nglobal object access auditing,\n\n323\n00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:09.290\nin which case you can audit\neverything on that server.\n\n324\n00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:12.530\nLet's say, you've got a file server,\nand you enable this.\n\n325\n00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.810\nYou can audit every\nsingle file on there and\n\n326\n00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:18.050\nnot have to go to each file\nindividually and set your auditing.\n\n327\n00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:21.660\nSo, if you've got a server that contains\nnothing but sensitive data and you need\n\n328\n00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.650\nthat type of record, Microsoft has made\nit easy with those new categories.\n\n329\n00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:28.930\nCuz prior to those categories,\nthere was a two step process and\n\n330\n00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:33.310\nthat's what I wanna show you here, because\na lot of times that global object access\n\n331\n00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:37.080\nauditing is a little over board or\noverkill for most scenarios.\n\n332\n00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.050\nI don't need to audit the entire server.\n\n333\n00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.900\nI've got one shared folder on there.\n\n334\n00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.960\nThat's the only thing people are accessing\nand I need to audit those files.\n\n335\n00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.340\nBut not every single file on that system.\n\n336\n00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.010\nSo, I wanna show you how to do that.\n\n337\n00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:52.580\nJust know that there is a global one now\nthat you can do in those new categories.\n\n338\n00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.730\nSo, what I'm gonna do, again,\n\n339\n00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:58.830\nit's a two step process if you\nwanna audit individual objects.\n\n340\n00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:04.270\nFirst thing, we're going to have to do\nis create a GPO to tell the machine,\n\n341\n00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.810\nor in this case, my file server\nthat I want to allow auditing.\n\n342\n00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:11.950\nYou're basically turning on object\naccess auditing on that machine.\n\n343\n00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:16.010\nSo, in my servers OU,\nis my server one, my file server.\n\n344\n00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:19.310\nI'm going to create a GPO and\nlink it to there.\n\n345\n00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:21.630\nAnd I'll call this one file auditing.\n\n346\n00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:27.450\nAnd then, I'm gonna go in and\nedit that policy.\n\n347\n00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.634\nAnd I'm gonna go to the same place,\n\n348\n00:18:30.634 --> 00:18:35.414\nPolicies > Windows Settings\n> Security Settings >\n\n349\n00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:40.950\nLocal Policy > Audit Policy,\nand then Audit Object Access.\n\n350\n00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:45.060\nAnd I'm gonna define these policy\nsettings, and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n351\n00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.740\ndo success and failure.\n\n352\n00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:50.220\nNow again, this is just telling\nthe server that it's okay to do that or\n\n353\n00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.680\nthat it's allowed to do that.\n\n354\n00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.310\nWhen I go and actually set up\nthe auditing, I might choose success or\n\n355\n00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.720\nfailure or both.\n\n356\n00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:02.410\nAll right, if I didn't turn on\nsuccess here and just failure.\n\n357\n00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:03.310\nI could go to the server and\n\n358\n00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.950\nsay, I want to audit this file and,\nsuccess and failure.\n\n359\n00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.360\nWell, guess what?\n\n360\n00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.340\nIt's not going to audit success,\nbecause you didn't tell it,\n\n361\n00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.370\nit was allowed to do success.\n\n362\n00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.740\nSo, this setting is not telling\nit what you're going to do,\n\n363\n00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.430\nit's saying what it's allowed to do.\n\n364\n00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.082\nIf that makes sense.\n\n365\n00:19:17.082 --> 00:19:20.200\nAll right, I'll do both success and\nfailure, and I'll click OK.\n\n366\n00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.350\nAnd that one is scoped to the OU\nthat that server's in, so\n\n367\n00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:28.230\nthe next thing that I would need to do\nis refresh Policy on this server so\n\n368\n00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.810\nthat it knows about that new policy.\n\n369\n00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.840\nSo, I'll do a little GP update,\nswitch force.\n\n370\n00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.080\nAnd we'll let this guy see that\nnew policy that we put in place.\n\n371\n00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:43.800\nThen we're gonna go and figure out what\nobjects we actually want to audit.\n\n372\n00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.580\nAnd you've got to decide what\npermissions you want to audit, right?\n\n373\n00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:52.100\nYou might have a phone document, and\nI'll talk and walk at the same time here.\n\n374\n00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.150\nYou might have an employee phone list,\nright?\n\n375\n00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:56.690\nEverybody is supposed to read.\n\n376\n00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.280\nEverybody should be able to look up\nsomebody's number, so they can call them.\n\n377\n00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.140\nBut you don't want people making changes\nto it, except for certain people.\n\n378\n00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.830\nSo, I might not audit read permission.\n\n379\n00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.990\nBecause everybody should\nbe able to read it.\n\n380\n00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:13.880\nWhat I wanna audit is strictly write\npermission or modify permission, right.\n\n381\n00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.450\nThat way if somebody makes a change or\ndeletes it, I'll know.\n\n382\n00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.980\nI don't care if they read it,\nthat's fine, right.\n\n383\n00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.080\nSo, you can be very specific\nwith your auditing.\n\n384\n00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.302\nWhat actual permission\ndo you want to audit?\n\n385\n00:20:24.302 --> 00:20:25.870\nAll right, let's take a look at it here.\n\n386\n00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:30.680\nI am going to go in to my E drive and\nI've got a data folder inside there.\n\n387\n00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.300\nThere's just a couple of\nfake documents that I made.\n\n388\n00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.720\nSo, if I want to audit.\n\n389\n00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.720\nAuditing like NTFS will inherit down, so\n\n390\n00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:42.660\nI can go to an individual file and\nI can set the auditing just that file.\n\n391\n00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.890\nOr if I know that all these files\nI want the same auditing settings\n\n392\n00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:50.350\nI could do it at the folder level and\nit will inherit them.\n\n393\n00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.950\nSo, to do auditing you pull\nup the Properties, and\n\n394\n00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:55.210\nthen you go to the Security tab.\n\n395\n00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:59.050\nAnd then, we're gonna click Advanced.\n\n396\n00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:02.680\nAnd in Advanced we'll\nclick on the Auditing tab.\n\n397\n00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.890\nAnd this is where I can choose to audit.\n\n398\n00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:08.010\nSo, you can see the name up here is E\ncolon data is the name of the folder.\n\n399\n00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.690\nThis is just who I am right now,\nwho the owner of the file is I should say.\n\n400\n00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:15.010\nI'm auditing and I'm gonna click Add.\n\n401\n00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:18.730\nAnd it's a lot like assigning permissions.\n\n402\n00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:20.630\nWe're gonna say, who do we wanna audit?\n\n403\n00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:24.199\nSo, for my principle I might\nsay Authenticated Users.\n\n404\n00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:26.230\nRight?\n\n405\n00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.100\nBut, maybe I just wanna know,\n\n406\n00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:33.070\nmaybe all employees can read,\nwrite, whatever they want.\n\n407\n00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:38.220\nBut my contractors or my temp employees\ncan't go in there and make changes.\n\n408\n00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.210\nSo.\nmaybe instead of authenticated users,\n\n409\n00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:42.190\nI just put a specific group.\n\n410\n00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.050\nSo.\nyou see what I'm saying?\n\n411\n00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:47.220\nWhen you're planning out this auditing\nstrategy you wanna get everything you need\n\n412\n00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.640\nBut also at the same time\ndon't get extra stuff.\n\n413\n00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.510\nYou want to think about\nwhat it is I need to see.\n\n414\n00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.920\nI don't care if you my users access it,\n\n415\n00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:58.090\nI only care when that\ncontractor's group accesses it.\n\n416\n00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.600\nSo.\ninstead of authenticated users\n\n417\n00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.858\nput a specific group.\n\n418\n00:22:00.858 --> 00:22:01.930\nHeck you could, technically,\n\n419\n00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:05.450\nI could say I only need to know if\nRonnie needs to make changes to this.\n\n420\n00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.680\nBecause he keeps goofing it up\nevery time he goes in there.\n\n421\n00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.610\nSo ,I could put Ronnie here and\naudit just Ronnie Wong.\n\n422\n00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:13.560\nAnybody else accesses it,\nit wouldn't audit.\n\n423\n00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.120\nAnd then, for a success failure or all,\n\n424\n00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:22.530\nagain this has to be enabled in\nthe policy itself, the GPO, right?\n\n425\n00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:26.500\nIt won't show you here,\nif I didn't turn on success in the GPO,\n\n426\n00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.810\nsuccess will still show up in this list,\nand I can pick it all I want.\n\n427\n00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:34.020\nBut it won't actually audit success,\nif it's not enabled in the GPO.\n\n428\n00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.510\nAnd I wanna do, I'm going to\nsay all just for our demo here.\n\n429\n00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.430\nSo, authenticated users all.\n\n430\n00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:41.840\nAnd again, there's my inheritance.\n\n431\n00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.480\nThis folder, subfolder, and files.\n\n432\n00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.580\nAnd I'm gonna modify,\nI'm gonna audit full control.\n\n433\n00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.320\nBut you can see that I could choose\nwhatever permission I wanted to\n\n434\n00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.670\nopt, right?\n\n435\n00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.110\nAnd I could even do some dynamic or\nkind of conditions down here.\n\n436\n00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:59.350\nI could say, I only wanna audit it,\n\n437\n00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:04.870\nif Ronnie's accessing this file through\na VPN connection or from a laptop, right?\n\n438\n00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.620\nIf he's at his desktop, I don't care.\n\n439\n00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.870\nBut if he's accessing it remotely,\nI need to know.\n\n440\n00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:13.700\nAnd I've done things like that in\norganizations where the C level,\n\n441\n00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:18.190\nthe CEOs and CIOs and things like that,\nthey're allowed to access documents, but\n\n442\n00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:20.420\nonly if they're at their workstation.\n\n443\n00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.110\nIf they've walked down the hall, or\n\n444\n00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:27.250\nthey're down on the sales floor, I don't\nwant them saying, hey, move over for\n\n445\n00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.660\na second and\naccessing that document and potentially\n\n446\n00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.970\nexposing information to people that\naren't authorized or things like that.\n\n447\n00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:35.400\nSo, pretty cool stuff you can do.\n\n448\n00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:40.920\nHere, we'll limit it to very simple audit,\nfull control for authenticated users.\n\n449\n00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.270\nAnd I'll click OK.\n\n450\n00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:46.020\nAnd then, we'll click OK on here.\n\n451\n00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.875\nAnd then finally, okay, on the properties.\n\n452\n00:23:47.875 --> 00:23:49.790\n[LAUGH]\n>> All okay's.\n\n453\n00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.235\n>> Yeah it is.\n\n454\n00:23:51.235 --> 00:23:55.457\nAll right Ronnie, the next thing I want\nto do, this is something I would not ever\n\n455\n00:23:55.457 --> 00:23:57.789\nrecommend doing, but\nso that we can see it,\n\n456\n00:23:57.789 --> 00:24:01.720\nI am gonna go to the security log\nBecause that's where all auditing goes.\n\n457\n00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.676\nAnd I'm going to clear the log.\n\n458\n00:24:03.676 --> 00:24:06.390\nNow in the real world,\nRonnie we would never do that right?\n\n459\n00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:07.130\n>> Right.\n\n460\n00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.458\n>> I mean that's our record of\neverything that's going on.\n\n461\n00:24:09.458 --> 00:24:12.700\nIf you're gonna clear it,\nyou would save it first and then clear it.\n\n462\n00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.060\nBut I just want to see.\n\n463\n00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:18.609\nSo now there's one entry in my security\nlog from me clearing the log file.\n\n464\n00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:20.960\nNow over here is Rob.\n\n465\n00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:30.246\nAnd I'm gonna connect to that Share.\nSvr01\\data.\n\n466\n00:24:30.246 --> 00:24:36.080\nAnd I'm just gonna open up that\nfirewall config and say, Hello world.\n\n467\n00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:40.180\nAnd I'll close it and I'll save it.\n\n468\n00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.390\nAnd I'll disconnect from that share.\n\n469\n00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:46.160\nAnd then we're gonna flip back over to\nour audit log and nothing happened.\n\n470\n00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.510\nOh wait they don't refresh\nautomatically right.\n\n471\n00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:51.536\nSo I'll click refresh and-\n>> Wow.\n\n472\n00:24:51.536 --> 00:24:54.300\n>> Yeah there's one or two.\n\n473\n00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.790\nLet me get my scrolls set up here.\n\n474\n00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:58.480\nThere's a couple of new events.\n\n475\n00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.160\n>> Just a few.\n\n476\n00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.590\n>> In my log.\n\n477\n00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.564\nOkay and notice the timestamp.\n\n478\n00:25:03.564 --> 00:25:09.120\n2:22, oops I just scrolled all\nthe way down there, 31, right.\n\n479\n00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:13.203\nOops and it keeps, it's generating a\ncouple more, keeps jumping back up on me.\n\n480\n00:25:13.203 --> 00:25:15.287\nYou can see if I can click\nthat fast enough, there we go.\n\n481\n00:25:15.287 --> 00:25:20.179\nStarting at 2:22:31,\nthat's when I accessed that and\n\n482\n00:25:20.179 --> 00:25:22.770\nas we go up, all the way to there.\n\n483\n00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:23.370\nSo what is that?\n\n484\n00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:26.790\nAbout 15 entries or so in that log file?\n\n485\n00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:28.200\nAll right.\n\n486\n00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.300\nLet's see if I can even find the, again,\n\n487\n00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.360\nthis is where filtering\nwould really come into play.\n\n488\n00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.790\nDetail files here, there's one of them.\n\n489\n00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.820\nSo our network shared\nobject was checked to see\n\n490\n00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.090\nwhether client can be\ngranted desired access.\n\n491\n00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.430\nAnd see, that's the thing\nis we don't think about it.\n\n492\n00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:49.760\nWe're thinking oh,\nI'm just gonna audit this file.\n\n493\n00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.530\nBut when you do that,\nit's gonna audit every little thing.\n\n494\n00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:53.790\nThem making the connection.\n\n495\n00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.320\nThem connecting to the folder.\n\n496\n00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.070\nThem double clicking on the folder.\n\n497\n00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:58.100\nThem viewing the files.\n\n498\n00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.000\nWindows Explorer has to list\nthe files inside there.\n\n499\n00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.460\nThem double clicking on the file.\n\n500\n00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.190\nOpening the file.\n\n501\n00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:04.760\nMaking a change on the file.\n\n502\n00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:05.570\nSaving the file.\n\n503\n00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:06.260\nClosing the file.\n\n504\n00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.230\nDisconnecting.\n\n505\n00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:10.790\nSo that's one user accessing one file.\n\n506\n00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:14.060\nNow multiply that by\nthousands of users and\n\n507\n00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.570\nhundreds of thousands of\nobjects on that server and\n\n508\n00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:20.080\nyou get to see what I mean about,\nthese log values can fill up pretty fast.\n\n509\n00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:24.780\n>> It is amazing that that one file\nthat you changed and now we have 15, 20,\n\n510\n00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.620\nmaybe even 30 actual\ndifferent entries there.\n\n511\n00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.220\nAnd it was actually continuing\nto increment up as well.\n\n512\n00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:33.980\nBecause the system is still actually doing\na lot of checks on that one file too.\n\n513\n00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:38.920\nWell, Mike, that is very neat,\nthe very fact that we can actually say,\n\n514\n00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:42.340\nhere's the policies that we've got in\nplace so that we can do this auditing so\n\n515\n00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:46.220\nthat we can check on who's\nactually logging in, logging off.\n\n516\n00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.330\nWho's actually accessing\ncertain files here.\n\n517\n00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:52.720\nAnd it's a great place for us to have\na nice view of the security, but\n\n518\n00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.530\nit's still one of those\nthings that we have to go and\n\n519\n00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:58.430\ncheck on individual machines as well,\nright?\n\n520\n00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:01.180\nWhere it's not always centralized\nto what we think it's gonna be.\n\n521\n00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:01.770\n>> Exactly.\n\n522\n00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:05.380\nAnd this is where we've talked in earlier\nwhen we were learning about Group Policy.\n\n523\n00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:09.530\nNow, why do I create that OU That\nhas all my file servers in it.\n\n524\n00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:14.080\nBecause I can now create one policy that\nenables auditing on that object access.\n\n525\n00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:17.300\nAnd I can do it once instead of having\nto link it to five different places.\n\n526\n00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:23.480\nSetting up that OU structure to support\nthe scoping of GPOs, is crucial.\n\n527\n00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.420\n>> All right.\n\n528\n00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:29.400\nMike, thank you again for taking the time\nto show us about the account log on\n\n529\n00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.950\nauditing that we can do\nas well as object access.\n\n530\n00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:35.780\nThese are really helpful things that\nwe do use in the real world constantly,\n\n531\n00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:40.150\nbecause being able to track these things\nis an important part of what we have to do\n\n532\n00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:43.840\nespecially we start taking a look\nat in the security realm, but\n\n533\n00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:48.910\nalso just in the fact that we have\nto deal with regulations as well.\n\n534\n00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:51.020\nSo those are all also good things.\n\n535\n00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.700\nMike, any last words on setting this?\n\n536\n00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.560\nAnything tricky, besides what you showed\nus in those two places on Object Access.\n\n537\n00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.140\n>> I don't think so.\n\n538\n00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.490\nPlay around with a couple of those\nother categories while you're in there.\n\n539\n00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:04.690\nBut most of the rest of them\nare pretty straightforward.\n\n540\n00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:06.720\nTurn them on, turn them off and\n\n541\n00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.220\nyou're gonna see what's\ngoing on in your log files.\n\n542\n00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.180\nThe Object Access one's a little different\nbecause you've got to enable it.\n\n543\n00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.710\nAnd then you gotta go to each object\nthat you want to audit and enable that.\n\n544\n00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:19.280\nNow I got that new category, global,\nwhich makes things a little bit easier.\n\n545\n00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.330\nAnd then just yeah, as you said,\n\n546\n00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:23.070\nremembering the difference between\nlog on and account log on.\n\n547\n00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:27.590\n>> Alright, well that's a great place for\nus to also end this picker episode.\n\n548\n00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.900\nThank you Mike for again showing us that.\n\n549\n00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.590\nThank you for joining us.\n\n550\n00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:33.990\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n551\n00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.900\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n552\n00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.690\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n",

00:00:16.924\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:16.924 --> 00:00:20.364\ntoday we're gonna take a look\nat working with Group Policy.\n\n5\n00:00:20.364 --> 00:00:24.510\nSpecifically talking about deploying\nsoftware through Group Policy.\n\n6\n00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.170\nAnd this is a very neat subject for us.\n\n7\n00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.335\nAnd who better to help us than well Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:29.335 --> 00:00:30.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Mike, so\n\n9\n00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.840\nnow what I can ask you to do is I can\ndownload any of my executable files and\n\n10\n00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.950\nwe can use Group Policy to push em out,\nright?\n\n11\n00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.000\n>> I wish it was that convenient, right?\n\n12\n00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.620\nAs Ronnie said,\nit's a really cool concept,\n\n13\n00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.860\nsomething that maybe you didn't\neven think about, right?\n\n14\n00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.670\nWe talk about Group Policy being\nconfiguration management, being able to\n\n15\n00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.980\nconfigure all machines, a subset of\nmachines, all users, a subset of users.\n\n16\n00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.150\nWho would have thought about\ndeploying software with it?\n\n17\n00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.850\nSo it is a great concept, but\nthere are some limitations.\n\n18\n00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.430\nAll right?\n\n19\n00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.260\nAnd the first and\n\n20\n00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.460\nbiggest one that we're going to face\nis that it's only dot MSI files.\n\n21\n00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.980\n>> Oh, man.\n[LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.480\n>> Yeah.\n\n23\n00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.290\nI know.\n\n24\n00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.430\nWhich eliminates half the programs\nthat you wanted to install, right?\n\n25\n00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.280\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n26\n00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.350\nThe good ol Microsoft self installers,\nthose dot MSIs,\n\n27\n00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.740\nthat's the only thing I can\ndeploy using Group Policy.\n\n28\n00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.600\nI cannot do executables.\n\n29\n00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.001\nI cannot do, I'm trying to think if\nthere's any others that we could do.\n\n30\n00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.893\nYou actually can do ZAPs.\n\n31\n00:01:25.893 --> 00:01:27.280\nHave you ever heard of a ZAP?\n\n32\n00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.380\nIt's an older kind of a,\nI don't want to say compression.\n\n33\n00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.610\nA way to install applications,\nyeah exactly.\n\n34\n00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.520\nSo honestly I've never seen one in\nthe 15 years I've been doing this, but\n\n35\n00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.330\nI know they're out there.\n\n36\n00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.790\nSo if you had a ZAP file,\nyou could use those as well.\n\n37\n00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.550\nMSI's is really what we're\ngoing to be limited to.\n\n38\n00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.960\nIf you have an executable, a lot of\ntimes you can go to the vendor and\n\n39\n00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.760\nyou can get an MSI from them, right?\n\n40\n00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.640\nCuz really an MSIs, I don't want to say\nit's a wrapper around an executable but\n\n41\n00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.640\nit's a scaled up executable, right?\n\n42\n00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.180\nThe big difference\nbetween an executable and\n\n43\n00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.120\nan MSI, an executable runs,\ndoes its thing, and its done.\n\n44\n00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.790\nIt forgets about it.\n\n45\n00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.940\nIt has, that's it, right?\n\n46\n00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.900\nAnd if you've ever uninstalled a program\nthat was installed with an executable,\n\n47\n00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.870\nyou know what I mean.\n\n48\n00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.660\nBecause it'll leave things, like the\nfolder's still under, Program Files, and\n\n49\n00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.820\nthe shortcut is still on the desktop.\n\n50\n00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.470\nMSIs, it includes a whole\nset of instructions\n\n51\n00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.360\nthat help it install that application,\nand it keeps track of all the changes.\n\n52\n00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.440\nIt knows the changes that it made, so when\nit's time to uninstall it, you can do what\n\n53\n00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.810\nwe call a clean removal, cuz it can go\nback and undo all the changes that it did.\n\n54\n00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.320\nBecause it knows what it did, right?\n\n55\n00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.480\nSo it's like a smart executable.\n\n56\n00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.510\nThey are pretty cool.\n\n57\n00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.390\nBut that doesn't really have anything\nto do with our Group Policy, so\n\n58\n00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.180\nwe'll, we'll move on.\n\n59\n00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.390\nSo MSIs are the only\nthing that I can deploy.\n\n60\n00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.290\nThere's some other limitations to this,\none of them,\n\n61\n00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.720\nthe second one that we'll talk about is\nthe fact that it doesn't do any type of\n\n62\n00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.490\nlicensing for you,\nit doesn't control any of that.\n\n63\n00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.050\nSo, you can get yourself in\ntrouble with this one Ronnie.\n\n64\n00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.730\nWhat if I've got 20 licenses for\nan application.\n\n65\n00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.190\nI mean to link that Group Policy to\nthe Dev OU where I've got 15 employees.\n\n66\n00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.040\nThat leaves me five licenses to spare,\nright?\n\n67\n00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.720\nBut instead,\nI happen to scope it to the domain itself.\n\n68\n00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.610\nAnd I install it on 20,000\ncomputers instead of 20.\n\n69\n00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.320\nRight?\n\n70\n00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.110\nNow I'm in trouble.\n\n71\n00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.150\nI've got to get that removed before I get\naudited, or I could be in a world of hurt,\n\n72\n00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.920\nor be paying some big fines or\nbuying a whole lot of licenses, right?\n\n73\n00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.890\nSo, Group Policy software deployment\ndoesn't do anything as far as\n\n74\n00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.100\ntracking number of installations and\nhelping you with your licensing.\n\n75\n00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.130\nThird big problem with using Group Policy,\n\n76\n00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.810\nis that it doesn't do any type\nof success or failure messages.\n\n77\n00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.320\nWhen I apply that policy to that Dev OU,\nI hope it worked,\n\n78\n00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.210\nI hope all those people in\ndevelopment got that application.\n\n79\n00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.350\nBut I really don't know.\n\n80\n00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.610\nI mean I can see the Group Policy applied,\nright?\n\n81\n00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.770\nBut I don't know if the software\nsuccessfully installed.\n\n82\n00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:59.710\nCan they launch it?\n\n83\n00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.450\nSo there's no success failure there, I'm\neither checking with the guys down in dev\n\n84\n00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.790\nor waiting for them to call me to tell me,\nhey I got a problem.\n\n85\n00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.710\nI didn't get that program\nthat everybody else did.\n\n86\n00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.290\nSo there are some limitations to using\nGroup Policy to deploy software.\n\n87\n00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.080\nMicrosoft has other solutions, and\n\n88\n00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.330\nthere are third party solutions\nthat take care of all those issues.\n\n89\n00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.940\nAll right?\nWe can get into system center operations\n\n90\n00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.040\nmanager and configuration manager,\n\n91\n00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.360\nand those are very robust solutions for\ndeploying software.\n\n92\n00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.560\nThey can take care of licensing and\ntracking, and of that good stuff.\n\n93\n00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.120\nBut that's other licences.\n\n94\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.390\nI have to buy system side\nconfiguration manager.\n\n95\n00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.040\nI have to pay for operations manager.\n\n96\n00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.390\nThis is built in.\n\n97\n00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.810\nIt's free with my licence to\nServer 2012 and Group Policy.\n\n98\n00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.280\nSo, yes there are some limitations,\nbut in a small shop or\n\n99\n00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.270\neven if you're using some of\nthose other Deployment Tools.\n\n100\n00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.950\nIf it's just a simple,\nunlicensed program that's got an MSI,\n\n101\n00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.490\nI might find it easier\nto do a Group Policy\n\n102\n00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.140\nthan go through the trouble of\nsetting up Configuration Manager, and\n\n103\n00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.520\na software collection, and packaging up\nthe source files and all that good stuff.\n\n104\n00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.310\nSo, definitely has its place.\n\n105\n00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.307\nIt's not something that we should just\nwrite off an say I'm never gonna use that.\n\n106\n00:05:13.307 --> 00:05:13.932\nRight?\n\n107\n00:05:13.932 --> 00:05:16.720\nIt definitely has a time and\na place to be used.\n\n108\n00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.280\nSo let's take a look at what we can do\nwith good all software installation and\n\n109\n00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.430\nGroup Policy.\n\n110\n00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.850\nI've got my domain controller here and\n\n111\n00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.580\nI've got my Group Policy\nmanagement console opened up.\n\n112\n00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.950\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna start up at domain.\n\n113\n00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.120\nI'm gonna show a typical way we do this.\n\n114\n00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.980\nYou might think we'll,\nwell let me give you my scenario.\n\n115\n00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.480\nI wanna push out Notepad++ to my users,\n\n116\n00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.950\nlet's say some of my users in\nthe Development OU, all right?\n\n117\n00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.165\nIf I wanted to do it to all the people in\nDevelopment, I could just simply link it\n\n118\n00:05:47.165 --> 00:05:51.725\nright there, but\nI'm going to show you the way we do it in\n\n119\n00:05:51.725 --> 00:05:55.675\nmost corporate environments, cause I think\nit's a little bit easier to work with.\n\n120\n00:05:55.675 --> 00:05:59.145\nWhat I'm actually going to do, is I'm\ngoing to combine a couple techniques that\n\n121\n00:05:59.145 --> 00:06:03.305\nwe've already talked about in previous\nepisodes, namely security filtering.\n\n122\n00:06:03.305 --> 00:06:06.395\nSo I'm going to create a policy\nup here at the domain itself.\n\n123\n00:06:06.395 --> 00:06:12.990\nAnd I'm going to call this,\nNotepad++, and I'll click OK.\n\n124\n00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.430\nSo that's linked to the domain.\n\n125\n00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.750\nThen I'm going to edit this policy and\nwe'll do our software deployment.\n\n126\n00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.570\nNow, when we do our software deployment,\nwe can deploy software either to\n\n127\n00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.940\nthe computer, underneath software\nsettings, I have software installation.\n\n128\n00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.120\nOr to the User,\n\n129\n00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.230\nunderneath their Policies, I have Software\nSettings and Software Installation.\n\n130\n00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.340\nSo, if I do this to a user\nthen it wouldn't matter what\n\n131\n00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.430\nmachine they log onto, they're always\ngoing to have that program, right.\n\n132\n00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.280\nBecause as soon as they log on,\nthose user settings apply and\n\n133\n00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.060\nit should install that software well,\ndepending on the options I've chosen.\n\n134\n00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.590\nIf I do this under the computer half, now\nit doesn't matter what user's logging on.\n\n135\n00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.480\nIt's when the computer starts up,\nit applies those policies.\n\n136\n00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.260\nIt installs that software.\n\n137\n00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.630\nSo then, it's gonna be there no\nmatter who logs on to that machine.\n\n138\n00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.230\nSo what are you trying to do.\n\n139\n00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.910\nIf you wanna deploy it to all the machines\nin the development office, right or\n\n140\n00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.500\nin their little cubicles.\n\n141\n00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.530\nYou do it to the machine, and that way\nthat no matter what developer logs on,\n\n142\n00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.810\nthey've got access to that.\n\n143\n00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.200\nIf this is a program from my accountant\nand no matter what machine he or\n\n144\n00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.500\nshe logs on to.\n\n145\n00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.570\nThey need that program, then I would\ndo it under the User Configuration.\n\n146\n00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.350\nRight, so\nit depends on what your trying to do.\n\n147\n00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.720\nAnd there are some subtle\ndifferences between the user half.\n\n148\n00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.930\nAnd the computer half,\nand I'll point those out.\n\n149\n00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.560\nSo let's say we want to do it to the user.\n\n150\n00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.820\nI want to make sure that\nwhenever this user logs on,\n\n151\n00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.950\nthey've got access to this application.\n\n152\n00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.500\nSo I'm gonna go to Software Settings\nunderneath User Configuration.\n\n153\n00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.406\nNow before I get into this policy,\nI want to show you what I've set up.\n\n154\n00:07:46.406 --> 00:07:51.226\nI've got a folder over here on my\nfile server called SourceFiles.\n\n155\n00:07:51.226 --> 00:07:54.846\nAnd in there I've got a sub folder for\nNotepadPlusPlus.\n\n156\n00:07:54.846 --> 00:07:59.234\nAnd in there I've got all the setup\nfiles necessary for NotepadPlusPlus.\n\n157\n00:07:59.234 --> 00:08:03.216\nYes, you're gonna see there\nactually is an executable but\n\n158\n00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:06.100\nthis is the MSI file for\nNotepad plus plus.\n\n159\n00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.420\nIf you get a program a lot of\ntimes it's just the MSI file.\n\n160\n00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.650\nThat's all you need.\n\n161\n00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.430\nIf there might be some other support files\nthough, like some DLL or some INFs or\n\n162\n00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:16.510\nsomething like that,\n\n163\n00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.370\nyou would need to make sure those\nwere in this folder as well.\n\n164\n00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.040\nEverything needed to\ninstall the application\n\n165\n00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.450\nneeds to be available in this folder.\n\n166\n00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.830\nAll right?\nAnd then I've shared it out.\n\n167\n00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.470\nAnd I've actually shared it\nout to authenticated users.\n\n168\n00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.520\nAnd I've given them read and execute.\n\n169\n00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.940\nAs far as permissions go, my user\ndoesn't need permission to install.\n\n170\n00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.545\nLike normally Ronnie, we gotta be\nan administrator to install software.\n\n171\n00:08:36.545 --> 00:08:37.480\n>> Right?\n\n172\n00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.290\nWith that process remember\nthat administrative\n\n173\n00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:43.910\nuser is the one that actually can\nmake changes to the computer system.\n\n174\n00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:46.360\nSo a lot of times a regular,\nstandard user cannot do that and\n\n175\n00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.650\nthat's why we might actually\nhave to worry about it.\n\n176\n00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:49.850\nSo just be aware.\n\n177\n00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.460\n>> Yeah, and so with group policy\nit's gonna automatically escalate.\n\n178\n00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.657\nWhen the group policy,\nthe client side extension runs,\n\n179\n00:08:54.657 --> 00:08:56.500\nit'll run with administrative credentials.\n\n180\n00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.910\nSo I don't have to make them\nan administrator to install the program.\n\n181\n00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.620\nAnd that's a big thing, right?\n\n182\n00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.600\nI don't wanna make them an administrator\njust to install software because they can\n\n183\n00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.100\ndo other things with the machine with\nthose administrative rights, right so.\n\n184\n00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.758\nA key to note there is you don't have\nto make an administer it will take care\n\n185\n00:09:13.758 --> 00:09:15.531\nof escalating those credentials.\n\n186\n00:09:15.531 --> 00:09:19.026\nSo the first thing we do once we've\ngot the source files set up and\n\n187\n00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:22.588\nthe best practice says to make a sub\nfolder for each application so\n\n188\n00:09:22.588 --> 00:09:25.570\nyou saw me make that\nnotepad plus plus folder.\n\n189\n00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.110\nWe are going to right click new.\n\n190\n00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.223\nPackage.\n\n191\n00:09:29.223 --> 00:09:32.128\nAnd then I need to find\nthose source files.\n\n192\n00:09:32.128 --> 00:09:35.339\nNow you can see I've actually browsed so\nit recently so it shows up in my history.\n\n193\n00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:38.061\nBut let's pretend it didn't, all right.\n\n194\n00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:39.381\nSo we'll cheat here.\n\n195\n00:09:39.381 --> 00:09:44.320\nYou might be tempted, if those source\nfiles were on this domain controller.\n\n196\n00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.530\nYou might be tempted to browse to\nthat folder and select it, right.\n\n197\n00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.870\nBut that would be a local path,\nC colon back slash source files.\n\n198\n00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.070\nAnd what would happen is if that\nsetting applied to Ronnie's machine,\n\n199\n00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:58.450\nhis machine would look at C colon,\nhis local drive, for\n\n200\n00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.650\na copy of those source files and\nit's not gonna find it.\n\n201\n00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:05.050\nSo you can't use a local path,\nyou've gotta use a UNC path for this.\n\n202\n00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:10.051\nSo I'm gonna browse to that share,\nback slash back slash SVR zero one back\n\n203\n00:10:10.051 --> 00:10:15.700\nslash source files and then ill navigate\ninto there and grab that executable.\n\n204\n00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.300\nI did that kind of quick, but\ni selected that executable.\n\n205\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.960\nI'm sorry not the executable,\nthe MSI file right.\n\n206\n00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.960\nThen the next option I get here\nis to publish, or assign, or\n\n207\n00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:31.610\nadvanced just lets you choose\nkind of all the options.\n\n208\n00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:36.182\nLet's take a quick second and talk about\nthe difference between publish and assign.\n\n209\n00:10:36.182 --> 00:10:37.144\nAll right.\n\n210\n00:10:37.144 --> 00:10:41.420\nIf we assign software to a user.\n\n211\n00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:46.890\nWhat's gonna happen is when they log on\nthat software is gonna be advertised.\n\n212\n00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.930\nThey'll see it in there start menu, or\n\n213\n00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:54.430\nthey'll see it on their desktop, and\ndepending on the operating system right,\n\n214\n00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.440\nthey might see a tile for\nthat application.\n\n215\n00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.650\nIf there's any file types for that\napplication, it'll show the right icon.\n\n216\n00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.890\nLike you now, when you, if you don't\nhave Office or Excel installed,\n\n217\n00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:07.810\nand you have an Excel\nfile on your desktop,\n\n218\n00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:11.220\nyou get that generic icon cause it\ndoesn't know what to use to open it.\n\n219\n00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.890\nWell if I had assigned Excel to you\nthen it would actually show the Excel\n\n220\n00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:15.700\nicon, right?\n\n221\n00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.580\nCuz it will go ahead and\nset up those file type associations.\n\n222\n00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.560\nBut it doesn't actually install it,\nall right.\n\n223\n00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.850\nSo it's gonna look like it's installed,\nyou're gonna see it in your menus, and\n\n224\n00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.260\nif you click on it, that's when\nit goes to install the program.\n\n225\n00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.690\nThat's what we mean by advertise.\n\n226\n00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.360\nIt looks like it's there, it,\nseems to the user like it's there, but\n\n227\n00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.270\nit won't actually be installed\nuntil they try to launch it.\n\n228\n00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:39.239\nThat way if they don't ever try to launch\nit, there's no reason to install it.\n\n229\n00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.520\nI can set it up so it just goes ahead and\n\n230\n00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.970\ninstalls without them\nhaving to click on it.\n\n231\n00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.160\nAgain that might be good for\nan unlicensed type application.\n\n232\n00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.968\n>> Now Mike, that sounds a lot like the\nword publish but you're actually saying\n\n233\n00:11:52.968 --> 00:11:54.296\nit's actually a sign\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n234\n00:11:54.296 --> 00:11:55.229\n>> I just wanted to make sure.\n\n235\n00:11:55.229 --> 00:11:55.982\nOkay.\nAll right.\n\n236\n00:11:55.982 --> 00:11:58.438\n>> It is confusing\n>> It is twisty little thing here.\n\n237\n00:11:58.438 --> 00:12:00.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n238\n00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.480\nYou can also assign to the computer.\n\n239\n00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.620\nIf I, well I'll show you in a minute,\nif I go underneath that computer half into\n\n240\n00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.300\na new package, I go through the same thing\nand I'll see assign as an option there.\n\n241\n00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.420\nNow if I assign it to a computer\nit's gonna automatically install.\n\n242\n00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.380\nBecause a computer is not going\nto click on an icon or a tile or\n\n243\n00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.390\nchoose to open a file, right?\n\n244\n00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:26.730\nSo, when you assign it to a user,\nwe do what we call document invocation.\n\n245\n00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:30.110\nMeaning it will assign it when I\nactually click on it or try to run it.\n\n246\n00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.820\nIf I assign it to a computer,\n\n247\n00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.780\nit installs in the background\nby the time the user logs on.\n\n248\n00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.140\nIt's already actually installed.\n\n249\n00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.310\nPublishing is a little different,\npublishing as Ronnie said,\n\n250\n00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:44.160\nsounds like what we did was publishing it,\nwe made it look like it was there.\n\n251\n00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.408\nAnd that's assigning it.\n\n252\n00:12:45.408 --> 00:12:47.642\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Publishing it makes it available but\n\n253\n00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:49.662\nit doesn't really show you.\n\n254\n00:12:49.662 --> 00:12:54.830\nWhat's gonna happen is if I publish this\nto a user, they won't see the Excel icon.\n\n255\n00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.860\nThey won't see it in their start menu.\n\n256\n00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.710\nThey're actually gonna have to go\nto Add and Remove Programs and\n\n257\n00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:04.590\nin there, they'll find a list\nof published applications.\n\n258\n00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:09.820\nAnd then they can choose which one they\nwant to install or not to install, right?\n\n259\n00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.772\nSo you're publishing a list\nof applications, basically.\n\n260\n00:13:12.772 --> 00:13:16.050\nAnd, again, kinda the same idea.\n\n261\n00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:19.870\nIf not everybody needs it, I just\nwant to publish it make it available.\n\n262\n00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.370\nIf they want it, they're gonna have\nto know to go there and install it.\n\n263\n00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.690\nIt can be set up to do\ndocumented vacation as well.\n\n264\n00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:27.800\nDoing the publishing.\n\n265\n00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.590\nWhere if I launch an Excel file,\nit can look at file type associations and\n\n266\n00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:35.700\nsay wait theres a program that's been\npublished that can open this type of file.\n\n267\n00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.040\nThey just double-clicked on it.\n\n268\n00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.150\nLet me grab it and install it, right?\n\n269\n00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.230\nOr they can go through their Add Remove\nprograms and say, you know I want Excel,\n\n270\n00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.890\nI want Word, I don't want Powerpoint.\n\n271\n00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.050\nSo, they can pick and choose there.\n\n272\n00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.490\nYou can even set up categories\nwithin that publishing so\n\n273\n00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.130\nwhen they go into Add Remove programs,\n\n274\n00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:54.980\nthey might see productivity apps,\ngraphical apps, and things like that.\n\n275\n00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.910\nBut you can't publish to a computer.\n\n276\n00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.900\nAgain, same concept,\nwhereas when we assign it,\n\n277\n00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:05.130\nit automatically installs because the\ncomputer's not gonna choose to install it.\n\n278\n00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.160\nWell publishing it,\nyou've got to open up add and\n\n279\n00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.060\nremove programs, and pick if you\nwant to install the program or not.\n\n280\n00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.310\nWell a computer doesn't do that, right?\n\n281\n00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:17.040\nSo you cannot publish to a computer,\nyou can only assign to a computer and\n\n282\n00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.760\nit's automatically installed when\nyou assign it to the computer.\n\n283\n00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.170\nAll right.\nSo we're gonna go ahead and assign it and\n\n284\n00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.735\nwe'll click okay.\n\n285\n00:14:25.735 --> 00:14:27.790\nAnd then it's gonna going grind for\na second.\n\n286\n00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.340\nAnd it's reaching out and making sure\nit can get to those source files.\n\n287\n00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.400\nMaking sure that they're available,\nthat they're shared out properly.\n\n288\n00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.733\nAnd it's going to pull some information\nback actually about this application.\n\n289\n00:14:38.733 --> 00:14:43.060\nBecause the MSI file contains\nmetadata about the application.\n\n290\n00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.920\nAnd so you can see I haven't told it.\n\n291\n00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.610\nMany of this, right?\n\n292\n00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.000\nI just point it into that MSI file,\nit has the name,\n\n293\n00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.530\nhas my version,\nshows me where that source is, right?\n\n294\n00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.820\nNow if we double click on this, we'll see\nsome of the options I would have seen\n\n295\n00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.230\nhad we gone through the advanced\non that first train.\n\n296\n00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:03.840\nI can see deployment, it's been assigned.\n\n297\n00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.820\nYou can also uninstall it if it's\na if we remove that policy or\n\n298\n00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.930\nmove them out of the OU that\nthe policy's scoped to.\n\n299\n00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:15.460\nYou can also tell it to install at log on,\nwhere we don't have to wait for\n\n300\n00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.540\nthem to click on it.\n\n301\n00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.330\nWe'll just go ahead and install it.\n\n302\n00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.790\nThere's also options for upgrades.\n\n303\n00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.460\nSomething else we can\ndo with group policy.\n\n304\n00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.420\nNot only can we install software,\nwe can upgrade software.\n\n305\n00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:30.430\nLet's say that version 693 comes out for\nnotepad plus plus.\n\n306\n00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.680\nWell I can come in here and\nI can create a new package and\n\n307\n00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.980\nI can say this package\nupgrades that older package.\n\n308\n00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.090\nNow when I do an upgrade I\ncan say force the upgrade\n\n309\n00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:45.060\nwhere anybody that has the old version is\nautomatically gonna get the new version.\n\n310\n00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.680\nI can also say let them choose.\n\n311\n00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.638\nIf they want to keep the old version,\nfine.\n\n312\n00:15:49.638 --> 00:15:51.858\nIf they want to move to the new version,\nfine.\n\n313\n00:15:51.858 --> 00:15:53.686\nSo, you could have some\npeople running one version,\n\n314\n00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:55.158\nsome people running a different version.\n\n315\n00:15:55.158 --> 00:15:59.450\nOr you could just make it optional\nwhere they don't have to upgrade or\n\n316\n00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.530\nthey can upgrade if they want to.\n\n317\n00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.120\nSo, you've got a couple options\nthere with the upgrades.\n\n318\n00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.480\nThe categories, this when I'm publishing.\n\n319\n00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.880\nThis is where it's gonna put it\nunder a particular category.\n\n320\n00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.900\nModifications is for MST files.\n\n321\n00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.760\nMSI is that Microsoft Self-Installer.\n\n322\n00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.090\nMST files\nare the Microsoft Transform files.\n\n323\n00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:20.480\nOffice is a common use for\n\n324\n00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.850\nthis like when I install Office,\nif I'm pushing out a group policy for\n\n325\n00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:28.340\nhere in the States, I need Office\ninstalled with English as a language.\n\n326\n00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.930\nBut for my office over there in Madrid,\nI need Spanish as a language.\n\n327\n00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:36.520\nThis MST file can allow me to make some of\nthose configuration changes that you would\n\n328\n00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.960\nnormally get during the installation\nwizard like what language and\n\n329\n00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.700\nthings like that, I can do that in\nan MST file, or a transform file.\n\n330\n00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.050\nAnd then, of course,\nthere's the security tab but again,\n\n331\n00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:50.620\nwe really don't have to mess\nwith the security tab for\n\n332\n00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.800\nthe package itself, right, cuz it's\ngonna run with escalated credentials.\n\n333\n00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.930\nSo, let's just go ahead leave all that,\nwe'll click OK.\n\n334\n00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:01.490\nAnd now, I've got my policy that\nis assigning notepadplusplus.\n\n335\n00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:05.910\nNow, the next thing we're gonna show you\nis not directly readed to installing\n\n336\n00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.930\nsoftware with due policy but like you\nsaid it's a common way of doing it.\n\n337\n00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.210\nNotice, I scope this to the domain.\n\n338\n00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.130\nA lot of times when were\ninstalling software,\n\n339\n00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.860\nit's difficult because the users\nI want to apply it to or\n\n340\n00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:21.160\nthe computers I want to apply it\nto are not all in the same OU.\n\n341\n00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.320\nAll right.\nWe've talked about scoping GPO's.\n\n342\n00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.920\nNormally, with software,\nespecially if we're doing it to users.\n\n343\n00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:32.090\nBut computers just the same is\nwe'll do our security filtering.\n\n344\n00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.510\nWe'll go ahead and\nlink the policy to the domain.\n\n345\n00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.040\nLike I've done here.\n\n346\n00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:41.660\nThen, I'm gonna remove the authenticated\nusers from that policy.\n\n347\n00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.610\nSo, now nobody gets to apply it.\n\n348\n00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.000\nAnd then, I'm gonna add the group.\n\n349\n00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.560\nI create a group especially for\neach program, all right?\n\n350\n00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.690\nSo, I created a group\ncalled NotepadPlusPlus, and\n\n351\n00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.290\nI add just that group back.\n\n352\n00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:57.910\nSo now, only if you're in this group, do\nyou have permission to apply this policy?\n\n353\n00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.800\nSo, even though,\nit's linked to the domain, right?\n\n354\n00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.470\nIf you're not it this group\nit doesn't apply to you.\n\n355\n00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.240\nSo now, very easily, anytime I want\nsomebody comes to me and says, hey,\n\n356\n00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:11.330\nI need to to make sure Rob has Notepad++.\n\n357\n00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:12.200\nFine.\nI go,\n\n358\n00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.010\nI know I've already go a policy\npushing out Notepad++.\n\n359\n00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:18.710\nAll I have to do is go\nin active directory.\n\n360\n00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.880\nFind Rob's account, and\n\n361\n00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:31.630\nadd him to the Notepad++ group,\nand now Rob gets that software.\n\n362\n00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.210\nDoesn't matter where his account is in\nActive Directory, doesn't matter where\n\n363\n00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:38.470\nthat thing is scoped, as long as it's\nhigher than that, we're good to go.\n\n364\n00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:39.840\nIf somebody comes to me tomorrow and\n\n365\n00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.920\nsays, Ronnie needs that software as well,\nRonnie's not in the same OU.\n\n366\n00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.670\nDoesn't matter right?\n\n367\n00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:49.280\nI can go here, I can go grab Ronnie,\ngo to member of, add and\n\n368\n00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:56.530\nNotepad ++, and now Ronnie, next time he\nlogs on, will get that software right?\n\n369\n00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.490\nSo, really cool way if deploying software.\n\n370\n00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.470\nJust create your policy,\nlink it to the domain itself.\n\n371\n00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.730\nCreate a group just for that application.\n\n372\n00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:06.620\nAnd then, use your security\nfiltering on that policy to control\n\n373\n00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.310\nwho actually gets the application.\n\n374\n00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.290\nAll right, Ronnie so a lot of talking.\n\n375\n00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:12.160\nShould we try it out?\n\n376\n00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.460\nShould we check it out?\n\n377\n00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.047\n>> Yeah, I wanna see if this\nNotepadplusplus actually does get\n\n378\n00:19:17.047 --> 00:19:18.060\ninstalled.\n\n379\n00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:18.890\n>> Let's find out.\n\n380\n00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:19.510\nAll right.\n\n381\n00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:23.830\nSo, that was gonna be a user setting but\nI will tell you that user set,\n\n382\n00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:29.110\ncertain settings only apply when you log\non or log off and not during the refresh.\n\n383\n00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:31.160\nSoftware deployment is one of them.\n\n384\n00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.800\nIf I tried to do a GP update right now\ninstead of logging off and logging back\n\n385\n00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.610\non, it would say okay, I refreshed\npolicy and it wouldn't actually install.\n\n386\n00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:41.910\nIf I did a GP update enforce.\n\n387\n00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.420\nIt would reapply that policy and it would\ntell me, hey look there are certain\n\n388\n00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:49.230\nsettings that are only applied during\nlog on, do you want to log on.\n\n389\n00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.790\nIn fact, let's do that Ronnie,\nthat's actually something good to see.\n\n390\n00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:55.140\nSo, let's see I think I'm logged on,\nyeah I'm logged on as Rob.\n\n391\n00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:59.970\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open up the\ncommand prompt and I'm gonna do a little\n\n392\n00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:05.210\nGP update switch force and\nI'll bump that up just a hair, so you guys\n\n393\n00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:08.920\ncan see that a little bit better because\nI wanna see the message that comes up.\n\n394\n00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.200\nAll right.\n\n395\n00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.200\nSo, we'll let that update.\n\n396\n00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.540\nIt was a user setting so\ncomputer policy's gonna refresh, and\n\n397\n00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.270\nthen my user policy should refresh.\n\n398\n00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.539\nAnd we should get a little warning here.\n\n399\n00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.910\nAnd there we go.\n\n400\n00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:28.870\nGroup policy, client side extension,\nfolder redirection was unable to apply.\n\n401\n00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.030\nAnd I should have one for\nthe software as well.\n\n402\n00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.430\nIt seems to see it as\na folder redirection.\n\n403\n00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:36.180\nBut, that's OK.\n\n404\n00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.210\nSo, do you want to log off?\n\n405\n00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.330\nWe'll say, yes we want to log off.\n\n406\n00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:41.600\nCertain user policies here.\n\n407\n00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.180\nCertain user policies are enabled\nthat can only run during log on.\n\n408\n00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.439\nSoftware installation is\nanother one of those.\n\n409\n00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.790\nFolder redirection as well.\n\n410\n00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.650\nSo, we're gonna log off, and\nwe're gonna log back on as Rob.\n\n411\n00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:59.600\nAnd I forget Rob changed his password.\n\n412\n00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.210\nI should of just forced it to install.\n\n413\n00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.170\nLet's see what we got here.\n\n414\n00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.410\nThis is one similar to folder redirection.\n\n415\n00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.450\nI think, I mentioned that in\nthe other episode Ronnie.\n\n416\n00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:13.463\nWhere it doesn't always\nkick in on that first try.\n\n417\n00:21:15.625 --> 00:21:20.600\nAnd I still don't see any NotePad++\nwhen I do a little search for it.\n\n418\n00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.870\nSo, what I'm gonna do now is\nactually reboot the machine.\n\n419\n00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.260\nI know it seems a little drastic.\n\n420\n00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.760\nBut I'm just tell you from experience,\n\n421\n00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.340\nthat sometimes the easiest thing to\ndo is just to reboot that machine.\n\n422\n00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.810\n>> Yeah, usually giving it\nthe reset is what we also want,\n\n423\n00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:38.320\nbut let's make sure that we\nunderstand about the publishing and\n\n424\n00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.810\nthe assigning again,\ncuz I did get a little bit confused.\n\n425\n00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:44.050\nSo, let me make sure I got this\nright as we go through this, right.\n\n426\n00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.850\nSo, when we publish the software\nthrough using Group Policy,\n\n427\n00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:52.360\nwe can get it to make sure\nits available in the list.\n\n428\n00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.930\nBut, its not actually seen\nlike something you click on.\n\n429\n00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:55.790\n>> Correct.\n>> Yeah.\n\n430\n00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:57.490\nWe go to the list on that.\n\n431\n00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.612\nBut, we can't publish it to the computer\nbecause the computer can't click\n\n432\n00:22:00.612 --> 00:22:01.210\non anything.\n\n433\n00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.130\n>> That's right.\n>> So, it can run.\n\n434\n00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.440\nAll right, so publishing is that way.\n\n435\n00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.300\nStrange thing, like I said,\n\n436\n00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.885\nis the assigning where you're\nactually publishing it.\n\n437\n00:22:07.885 --> 00:22:09.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're assigning it and\n\n438\n00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.370\nyou can now actually see it, and\n\n439\n00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:14.140\nthen you have the opportunity\nto go ahead and click on it.\n\n440\n00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.280\nBut if you assign it to the computer,\nit can actually install.\n\n441\n00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.430\n>> It's gonna just install,\n\n442\n00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.350\nbecause the computer'll never click on it,\nexactly right.\n\n443\n00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:22.560\n>> All right, just want to make sure I was\n>> [CROSSTALK] I had that down right.\n\n444\n00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.655\n[LAUGH]\n>> You're paying attention.\n\n445\n00:22:23.655 --> 00:22:24.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n446\n00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.949\nSo, we're gonna try to log in as\nRob again here and see what we get.\n\n447\n00:22:30.178 --> 00:22:31.100\nKeep our fingers crossed.\n\n448\n00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.120\nDrumroll, please.\n\n449\n00:22:34.304 --> 00:22:35.670\nOops.\n\n450\n00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.460\nAnd I still don't see\nany Notepad++ just yet.\n\n451\n00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:43.500\nSo, what we would at this point is I\nwould start opening up a group policy,\n\n452\n00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:47.635\nor I mean, a command prompt, and let's\nfind out if the policy's even applying.\n\n453\n00:22:47.635 --> 00:22:54.930\nGpresult-r and\nNotepadplusplus is being applied, right?\n\n454\n00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.292\nBecause Rob is in that group so he has\npermission to apply that application.\n\n455\n00:22:58.292 --> 00:23:01.815\nIn fact, I just noticed, look what\njust popped up on my desktop there.\n\n456\n00:23:01.815 --> 00:23:02.820\n>> [LAUGH] Just took a moment.\n\n457\n00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.330\n>> Didn't show up on my search though.\n\n458\n00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:06.060\nWhy is that?\n\n459\n00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:06.940\nOh.\n>> That'll do it.\n\n460\n00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:07.820\nDone.\n\n461\n00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.430\n>> But then again,\nwe know how Microsoft search is.\n\n462\n00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.840\nThis is why we all love\nBing as our search engine.\n\n463\n00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.080\n[LAUGH]\nSo, they can't find it, but\n\n464\n00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.470\neven though it's not found by the search,\nthere it is.\n\n465\n00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:20.810\nIf we launch that.\n\n466\n00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:25.060\nI believe it's needs.net which\nthis machine might not have.\n\n467\n00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.730\nSo, I'm actually launching it.\n\n468\n00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:29.590\nBut notice the icon was there.\n\n469\n00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.240\nBut when I double clicked on it,\nit says preparing to install.\n\n470\n00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.480\nThat's what a signing does, right?\n\n471\n00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:38.440\nIt looks like it's installed but\nit doesn't actually install it.\n\n472\n00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.170\nAnd there it says, will not be\ninstalled because it might be unsafe.\n\n473\n00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.050\nI didn't sign it or anything like that.\n\n474\n00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:48.680\nSo, evidently,\nit doesn't like my Notepadplusplus but\n\n475\n00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.470\nagain that's another issue\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n476\n00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.880\nMaking sure that we've\ngot trusted software and\n\n477\n00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.768\nthat it's digitally signed and\nthat we trust the source.\n\n478\n00:23:56.768 --> 00:23:59.028\nWe'll do that in another episode.\n\n479\n00:23:59.028 --> 00:24:03.492\nBut at least you get to see how we can\ndo that software installation through\n\n480\n00:24:03.492 --> 00:24:04.428\nGroup Policy.\n\n481\n00:24:04.428 --> 00:24:09.008\nAnd, like I said, and this was back\nto your question, when you assign it,\n\n482\n00:24:09.008 --> 00:24:11.750\nit looks like it installed there.\n\n483\n00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.880\nBut as you saw it wasn't\nactually installed.\n\n484\n00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.710\nAnd also goes back to show you how one\nof the limitations of Group Policy.\n\n485\n00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:21.260\nIt failed, it didn't install.\n\n486\n00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.470\nI would never know that as\na SysAdmin looking at Group Policy.\n\n487\n00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:27.080\nI see the policy is applied,\nI think everything is good.\n\n488\n00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.793\nI'm going to have to wait until that user\ncalls me up and says, hey, you know what,\n\n489\n00:24:30.793 --> 00:24:32.334\nevery time I launch Notepad++,\n\n490\n00:24:32.334 --> 00:24:35.012\nit says this is untrusted software and\nit won't continue.\n\n491\n00:24:35.012 --> 00:24:37.648\nSo you see how Group Policy\ndoesn't help me in that respect.\n\n492\n00:24:37.648 --> 00:24:40.890\n>> Now I have a question\nto think about this.\n\n493\n00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.200\nSo as long as it's an MSI\nfile it should work.\n\n494\n00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.702\n>> Yep.\n>> Have you ever seen it where a large\n\n495\n00:24:45.702 --> 00:24:47.798\napplication also got hung up.\n\n496\n00:24:47.798 --> 00:24:50.092\nYou know what I'm talking about?\n\n497\n00:24:50.092 --> 00:24:51.193\n>> Yeah.\n>> Like a larger versus a small?\n\n498\n00:24:51.193 --> 00:24:52.193\n>> Yeah like Office or\nsomething like that. >> Yeah.\n\n499\n00:24:52.193 --> 00:24:53.900\n>> You know it definitely can.\n\n500\n00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.020\nOne of the other times that\nsoftware installation won't fire,\n\n501\n00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.352\nas if there's a slow link.\n\n502\n00:24:58.352 --> 00:25:01.390\nWe would talked about that\nearly in some episodes,\n\n503\n00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:05.270\nslow link detection by default\nis 500 kilobits per second, so\n\n504\n00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:08.760\nif you're on a dial up for\na slow internet connection at work and\n\n505\n00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:13.265\nit tries to apply Group Policy,\nit will not try to install software.\n\n506\n00:25:13.265 --> 00:25:16.175\nIf it's a large MSI like Office, and\n\n507\n00:25:16.175 --> 00:25:20.695\nwe're talking almost a gig sometimes I\nthink for that MSI, could have an issue.\n\n508\n00:25:20.695 --> 00:25:24.995\nIf I've deployed it to 100 of users or\n1,000 of users,\n\n509\n00:25:24.995 --> 00:25:28.845\nthat file server can get bogged down\ntrying to do all those disc IOs and\n\n510\n00:25:28.845 --> 00:25:31.109\nthe network could get\nsaturated trying to do that.\n\n511\n00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.840\nAnother cool thing though about MSI, so\n\n512\n00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.620\nyou know we keep talking\nabout all these negatives.\n\n513\n00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.690\nAnother really cool thing is it's\na resilient application now.\n\n514\n00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:43.412\nIf I push out an application\nusing Group Policy like this and\n\n515\n00:25:43.412 --> 00:25:48.010\nit's in MSI, this actually works with MSI\nwhether you use Group Policy or not, but\n\n516\n00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:49.970\nif the source files are still available.\n\n517\n00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:55.050\nLet's say I deployed Excel\nto Ronnie's machine and\n\n518\n00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:58.470\nRonnie accidentally deleted some\nof those source files for Excel.\n\n519\n00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:02.077\nHe went into Program Files,\nExcel or MS Office, Excel, and\n\n520\n00:26:02.077 --> 00:26:05.160\ndeleted a DLL file that\nExcel needed to run.\n\n521\n00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:09.510\nOr it just became corrupt\nthrough normal disk failure.\n\n522\n00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.110\nThe application, when it launched,\nwould say wait a second,\n\n523\n00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:14.330\nsomething is wrong, I can't launch.\n\n524\n00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.820\nLet me go back to the source files and\nfix myself.\n\n525\n00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:21.310\nIt will actually launch a repair on itself\nand as long as the source files are still\n\n526\n00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:26.080\navailable, it can fix itself and the user\njust says, wow, it's working again.\n\n527\n00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:30.830\nAnd everything's good, so\nthat's actually an advantage of MSIs,\n\n528\n00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:33.510\nreally not doing Group Policy deployment.\n\n529\n00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:35.530\nBut it is a pretty cool thing.\n\n530\n00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.342\nYou know Ronnie,\n\n531\n00:26:37.342 --> 00:26:40.620\nsomething else just popped in my head\nwhen we were talking about that as well.\n\n532\n00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.060\nAnd now I can't remember.\n\n533\n00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:44.560\nLet's see.\nWe set up our source.\n\n534\n00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.810\nYou asked me.\n\n535\n00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:49.350\nWell, if it comes back to me,\nI'll spit it out real quick.\n\n536\n00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:50.050\n>> All right.\n\n537\n00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:53.741\n>> So, [CROSSTALK]\n>> I told you I'd just jump in there.\n\n538\n00:26:53.741 --> 00:26:56.377\n[LAUGH] The updates.\n\n539\n00:26:56.377 --> 00:26:59.340\nOne of the things I failed to mention\nwhen we were talking about updating.\n\n540\n00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:03.610\nYou can only update software,\nthat's been deployed through GPOs.\n\n541\n00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:06.460\nWell let me rephrase that you can\nupdate any software you want.\n\n542\n00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.990\nYou can only use a Group Policy\nto update software\n\n543\n00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:13.490\nif the application was originally\ndeployed using Group Policy.\n\n544\n00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:17.155\nIn other words, if I went around to\neverybody's desktop and downloaded\n\n545\n00:27:17.155 --> 00:27:22.510\nNotepad++ and installed it manually and\nthen a new version of Notepad++ came out.\n\n546\n00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:25.600\nI can't deploy a policy that's\ngonna go and update it.\n\n547\n00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:31.080\nIf I originally deploy Notepad++ using\nGroup Policy and then an update came out,\n\n548\n00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.220\nI can now create a second GPO or even\nuse the same GPO to upgrade Notepad++.\n\n549\n00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.250\nBut you can't upgrade\nsomething using Group Policy,\n\n550\n00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:42.180\nthat wasn't initially\ndeployed using Group Policy.\n\n551\n00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.590\n>> Now Mike it actually sounds like for\nat least me.\n\n552\n00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:49.090\nManually going around and\ninstalling the software is the way to go.\n\n553\n00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:51.620\nKeeping track of every\nsingle one of those things.\n\n554\n00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.170\nDon't get me wrong,\nI'm sure I can learn how to do it, but\n\n555\n00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:55.480\nit's gonna take me years.\n\n556\n00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.272\nNah, it should only take you just\na little bit with the help that you\n\n557\n00:27:57.272 --> 00:27:58.017\nguys should receive here.\n\n558\n00:27:58.017 --> 00:27:58.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n559\n00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:03.018\nkinda realize that group policy is a way\nthat we can deploy that type of software.\n\n560\n00:28:03.018 --> 00:28:06.000\nRemember the key here on that\nsoftware is MSI files or ZAPs.\n\n561\n00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.370\nSince Mike says he hasn't\nseen one in 15 years,\n\n562\n00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:11.510\nI'm gonna trust him that we're probably\nnot gonna encounter that too often.\n\n563\n00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:15.090\nBut MSI files,\nno executables when we do that.\n\n564\n00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:19.880\nAlso, remember that we can actually\nassign or publish that software as well.\n\n565\n00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:24.350\nAnd, as tricky as it sounds, remember that\nthe idea of assigning through to the user\n\n566\n00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:27.750\nside, is gonna give them that\nability to click and install it.\n\n567\n00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.740\nIf you install it to the computer side,\nit should install automatically.\n\n568\n00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.240\nIf you publish it,\nit gives you a list, and\n\n569\n00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.090\nif you publish it to the user side,\nit's gonna give you a list.\n\n570\n00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:39.070\nBut then you can't actually do\nanything with the computer.\n\n571\n00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.260\nSo it's not gonna install for\n\n572\n00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.900\nyou if you actually try to\npublish it that way as well.\n\n573\n00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:44.950\nAnd.\n>> In fact it's greyed out.\n\n574\n00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:46.110\n>> If you want Group Policy,\n\n575\n00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:50.760\nyou can't choose publish when you\ngo to the computer half of GPO.\n\n576\n00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.950\n>> The hard part about this is you've\ngotta be patient with it the first couple\n\n577\n00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:54.990\nof times you do it.\n\n578\n00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:58.700\nMight be frustrating as you log off and\nlog back in again,\n\n579\n00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.430\nthen it might take longer,\nor you reboot the computer.\n\n580\n00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:05.290\nIt even took about 30 seconds before\nit even showed up on the desktop, so\n\n581\n00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:08.010\nit does take a little bit of time so\ndon't rush it.\n\n582\n00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:12.610\nThat's one of my worst,\nyou know traits that I have.\n\n583\n00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.970\nYou know I set it, it should be done, and\n\n584\n00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:17.760\nyou just have to actually give it some\ntime, especially when you're doing stuff\n\n585\n00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.750\nlike Software and\nmaking sure that that's not there as well.\n\n586\n00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:21.290\nAll right.\n\n587\n00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:25.360\nSo that's actually a good place for\nus to go ahead and end this episode.\n\n588\n00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.040\nSigning off or itpro.tv I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n589\n00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.020\n>> And I'm

00:00:17.390\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.300\ntoday we're gonna take a look at\nworking well with Group Policy.\n\n5\n00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.700\nSpecifically though, we're talking\nabout how we can configure and\n\n6\n00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.530\ncontrol client settings is what\nwe're taking a look at and so\n\n7\n00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.830\nwhen we start doing that right, we need\nto make sure we can control every aspects\n\n8\n00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.590\nof how we want computers\ninside of our domain to look.\n\n9\n00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.630\nTo be able to behave, to make sure\nthat we actually know what's going on,\n\n10\n00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.970\nand who better to help\nus than Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.310\nNow, Mike, do we really need this\nmuch control over our settings?\n\n12\n00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.390\n>> I think so, and\nits a lot of fun too, right?\n\n13\n00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.790\nBut absolutely, when we talk about\nusing group policy to control\n\n14\n00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.720\nmy client machines, and my user settings,\nand my machine settings.\n\n15\n00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.610\nIt's all about making sure that\nthese machines are in compliance\n\n16\n00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.380\nwith our company's policies.\n\n17\n00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.190\nAnd these policies are probably set\nby higher ups that know more than us.\n\n18\n00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.780\nThey've decided that these are the way\nwe want these computers configured.\n\n19\n00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.690\nThese are the settings that we want\napplied to these users or to those users.\n\n20\n00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.540\nAnd then, what our job is,\nis to implement that.\n\n21\n00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.150\nThey've written out these policies.\n\n22\n00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.000\nThese are the things that we have to sign\nwhen we get hired and things like that.\n\n23\n00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.560\nWe as IT have to be able to\nimplement those policies, and\n\n24\n00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.620\nGroup Policy is how we do it.\n\n25\n00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.790\nWe've talked about that, right.\n\n26\n00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.280\nIt's a way to do centralized\nconfiguration management\n\n27\n00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.810\ncuz I don't want to run around and\ntouch every machine.\n\n28\n00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.420\nIf they tell me that we need\na new firewall exception for\n\n29\n00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.450\na certain program and\nit's this particular port, I don't want to\n\n30\n00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.050\nhave to go touch every machine, I want to\nbe able to do that through Group Policy.\n\n31\n00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.920\nBecause that way, I can either do\nit to all machines on the network,\n\n32\n00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.410\nor just the machines in that department.\n\n33\n00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.300\nAnd I'm sure that it's\nbeing applied consistently,\n\n34\n00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.840\nwhereas if I'm running around\ntouching every machine,\n\n35\n00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.660\nthere's a real good chance I forget one,\nskip one cubicle, miss a laptop, and\n\n36\n00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.480\nnow all of a sudden I've got a machine\nthat's not in compliance with policy, and\n\n37\n00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.380\nthat's gonna get somebody in trouble,\nor get my network in trouble,\n\n38\n00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.640\nbecause I've left some gaping hole or\nsome vulnerability.\n\n39\n00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.270\nSo, having the ability to\nconfigure all of these settings,\n\n40\n00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.650\nthe 4,000 plus settings that we can\nget in a GPO, is a fantastic thing.\n\n41\n00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.580\nA little overwhelming, but cool.\n\n42\n00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.930\n>> There's no doubt that what also ends up\na lot of times is that as we're network\n\n43\n00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.900\nadministrators or system administrators,\nwe end up seeing that, hey,\n\n44\n00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.660\nwe put out some type of directive.\n\n45\n00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.350\nWe tell people that they need to change\nsomething like their home page inside of\n\n46\n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.370\nInternet Explorer and\nthey get lost in how to change it.\n\n47\n00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.320\nThey may not know where\nthe Internet options is.\n\n48\n00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.150\nThey may not know what tab to look on and\nhow that's gonna be done.\n\n49\n00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.250\nBut what we can do is we might be able\nto take some like group policy, and\n\n50\n00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.110\nbe able to help them\nchange those settings.\n\n51\n00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.080\nSo, not only implies with things like our\nsecurity policy here, but actually just\n\n52\n00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.590\nregular every day common things that\nthey might not be able to set up here.\n\n53\n00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.390\nSo, Mike let's start right there because\nthat's probably one of the common things\n\n54\n00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.840\nthat will affect the user when\nthey actually open up a browser.\n\n55\n00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.610\n>> Absolutely, and\nanother big plus there is remember\n\n56\n00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.090\nwhen we use group policy settings,\nthe user cannot change that interface.\n\n57\n00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.480\nIt locks that page.\n\n58\n00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.530\nSo, if my company has determined I want\neverybody to start on the same homepage,\n\n59\n00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.410\nwhen you open the browser it\nneeds to go to my company's\n\n60\n00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.430\nintranet site because that's where we\nsee our except open use policy and\n\n61\n00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.040\nother rules that they have to follow,\nand what's a user going to do.\n\n62\n00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.530\nThey're going to change that, they want to\ngoogle to be their homepage, or bing or\n\n63\n00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.780\nsomething else.\n\n64\n00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.650\nI can set that through group policy and\nthey can't change it, there's nothing they\n\n65\n00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.980\ncan do about it, right, so let's take\na look like Ronnie said, I'm gonna open up\n\n66\n00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.500\nmy group policy management console and I'm\ngonna go down to that employee's OU and\n\n67\n00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.590\nI'm gonna right click and I'm gonna create\na new GPO, and I'm gonna call it IE\n\n68\n00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.020\nstandards for\nlack of a better name we'll click OK,\n\n69\n00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.600\nand then we're gonna go in and\nwe're gonna edit that policy.\n\n70\n00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.040\nMost of the settings for\n\n71\n00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.080\nIE are gonna be under the User,\nsimply because it's an application\n\n72\n00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.520\nthat my users using the settings would\nbe under per user profile basis.\n\n73\n00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.650\nThere are a few underneath the Computer,\nbut not too many.\n\n74\n00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.920\nAnd we're gonna expand\nout underneath Policies.\n\n75\n00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.580\nWe'll expand out Administrative Templates.\n\n76\n00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.030\nAnd then, Windows Components and\nthen underneath there,\n\n77\n00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.640\nif I can make that a little bit bigger so\nwe can see it, I've got Internet Explorer.\n\n78\n00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.290\nSo if we want to do something like\nset their home page, for example,\n\n79\n00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.040\nto our company's website,\nI can go to Internet Explorer and\n\n80\n00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.420\nthe setting I'm looking for is,\nDisable Changing Homepage Settings.\n\n81\n00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.070\nI mean,\nthere are over 4,000 settings in here so\n\n82\n00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.900\nmemorizing where everyone is\nisn't all that important.\n\n83\n00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.690\nRemember we've got those\ngreat filter capabilities and\n\n84\n00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.785\nyou can also use your\nfavorite search engine Bing.\n\n85\n00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a Microsoft Class,\n\n86\n00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.050\nto find those settings as well.\n\n87\n00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.540\nBut I'll simply double click on it.\n\n88\n00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.500\nAnd choose enabled.\n\n89\n00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.060\nAnd then down here,\n\n90\n00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:04.950\nI'm gonna type in their homepage\nhttp://www.itpro.tv, and I'll click OK.\n\n91\n00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.900\nAnd so,\nnow that is gonna be their homepage.\n\n92\n00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.910\nAnd they're not gonna\nbe able to change it.\n\n93\n00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.310\nSo, it's a very, I've worked at a couple\nof organizations where we did just that.\n\n94\n00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.510\nWe had a company intranet site and\nwe had some rules and\n\n95\n00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.280\nrequirements that we wanted to make\nsure that everybody was aware of.\n\n96\n00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.230\nWhat better way to do it than\nset that on their homepage?\n\n97\n00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.380\nAnd they can say they didn't,\nthey weren't aware.\n\n98\n00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.060\nBut I can say every time\nyou open the browser.\n\n99\n00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.420\nAnd went to this page and\nthere it was in half inch letters.\n\n100\n00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.240\n>> Now, Mike, if you're kind of new\nat group policy, this sounds like\n\n101\n00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.710\nthe strangest wording in the world,\nwhere you say I am actually enabling\n\n102\n00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.070\nDisable changing homepage setting\nThat's got to be a tongue\n\n103\n00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.700\ntwister to know that, and logically\nmy mind, I think I would miss this.\n\n104\n00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.370\n>> It is.\nIt's kind of a case of,\n\n105\n00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.550\nalmost like a double negative would be,\nright?\n\n106\n00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.739\nYou're enabling, disabling the change.\n\n107\n00:05:58.739 --> 00:06:00.790\n[LAUGH] I don't know how\nmany times I say it,\n\n108\n00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.110\nit doesn't make it any more clear does it?\n\n109\n00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.990\nThe worst is what if I disable disabling?\n\n110\n00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.430\nChanging the homepage.\n\n111\n00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.515\nThat would allow you to\nchange your homepage.\n\n112\n00:06:09.515 --> 00:06:12.420\n[LAUGH] But there's gonna be\ntimes when they need that.\n\n113\n00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.470\nLet's say that I don't want\nanybody to change their homepage,\n\n114\n00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.530\nso I enable disabling\nchanging the homepage, right?\n\n115\n00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.780\nSo, that's turning that on,\ndisable changing the homepage.\n\n116\n00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.250\nBut then, for my dev team I want\nthem to be able to change it.\n\n117\n00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.420\nSo, I would have to make a policy\nthat counteracts the first policy.\n\n118\n00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.000\nSo, I'd actually have to go in and\nsay disable.\n\n119\n00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.401\nDisable changing the homepage settings.\n\n120\n00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:37.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right, I mean,\n\n121\n00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.970\nit can be a real mind twister Ronnie,\nit is.\n\n122\n00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.920\n>> Yes, so, it's very important for us to\nmake sure we work through the logic and\n\n123\n00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.620\nsee what we're doing.\n\n124\n00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.640\nBecause, if not, we might accidentally\ngo yeah, I want to disable this.\n\n125\n00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.140\n>> Yes.\n\n126\n00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.770\n>> Because it just says, okay yeah,\n\n127\n00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.740\nI'm disabling someone's ability to change\nmy homepage, but then I'd be wrong.\n\n128\n00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.550\n>> And most of these setting\nhave a great explanation.\n\n129\n00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.100\nLike, when I turn this on.\n\n130\n00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.580\nIf I look at the help over here.\n\n131\n00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.710\nIf you enable this policy setting, a user\ncannot set a custom default homepage.\n\n132\n00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:06.880\nRight.\nSo, it's telling you, hey,\n\n133\n00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.670\nif you turn this on, they're not gonna\nbe able to set their own home page.\n\n134\n00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.070\nIf you disable or\ndo not configure the home page,\n\n135\n00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.350\nthe home page check box is enabled and\nusers can choose their home page.\n\n136\n00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.590\nSo, even though,\nthe wording is a little tricky,\n\n137\n00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.100\nthe explanation kinda clears it up for\nus, right?\n\n138\n00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.405\nBecause sometimes the title,\nthey have to keep those titles short.\n\n139\n00:07:26.405 --> 00:07:29.025\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And sometimes they can be a little odd.\n\n140\n00:07:29.025 --> 00:07:31.390\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now, Mike, what if wanted to ensure,\n\n141\n00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.510\nlet's say a connection between our\nbusiness and our partner's website.\n\n142\n00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.760\nAnd didn't want them to go\nthrough deciding whether or\n\n143\n00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.380\nnot they needed to allow security\nsettings or not allow security settings.\n\n144\n00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.650\n>> That's a very common one.\n\n145\n00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.600\nWe know how Internet Explorer\nhandles its security by\n\n146\n00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.840\ndividing all web pages up into four zones.\n\n147\n00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.189\nInternet, Intranet, trusted sites,\nand restricted sites.\n\n148\n00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:56.162\nAnd let's say like Ronnie said, we've got\na business partner that my users have to\n\n149\n00:07:56.162 --> 00:07:59.590\nvisit their web page to order products for\nour manufacturing process.\n\n150\n00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.287\nAnd it requires, say, Active X controls,\nor something like that,\n\n151\n00:08:03.287 --> 00:08:07.558\nthat won't normally run if it's in the\ninternet zone, cause a lot of that stuff\n\n152\n00:08:07.558 --> 00:08:11.065\nis blocked by default, and\nI don't wanna lower those settings,\n\n153\n00:08:11.065 --> 00:08:15.528\nwhich then reduces my security overall,\nI wanna add that site to the trusted site,\n\n154\n00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:18.610\nso those types of controls\nwill be able to run.\n\n155\n00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:22.960\nBut like Ronnie said, I mean teach\nyour user to go to Internet Explorer,\n\n156\n00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.990\nclick on the little gear icon,\nchoose Internet Options,\n\n157\n00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.200\ngo to the Security tab, click on\nTrusted Sites, click Add, type in.\n\n158\n00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.000\nYeah, it's gonna be a little\nbit of a rough one, right?\n\n159\n00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.430\n>> Especially, the trusted one, right?\n\n160\n00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:36.510\nBecause it also has\nthat little check mark.\n\n161\n00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:37.820\n>> Yes.\n>> So, you sit there and\n\n162\n00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.160\nyou keep typing it in, you click OK,\nand it just keeps rejecting it.\n\n163\n00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.560\nAnd most users, especially, end users that\nare not familiar with what that setting\n\n164\n00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.210\ndoes, they may find themselves\nkind of like it was not working.\n\n165\n00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:48.970\nSo, what do they do?\n\n166\n00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.030\nThey just close it out, and\n\n167\n00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.050\nwe'll deal with it later and\nnot have to worry about it.\n\n168\n00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.252\nBut what Mike is going to show us is\nwe have the ability set up for them.\n\n169\n00:08:56.252 --> 00:08:58.960\n>> [INAUDIBLE] Absolutely,\nsame location here.\n\n170\n00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.390\nI'm under the user half and\nI'm in the Internet Explorer settings.\n\n171\n00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:07.070\nThis time I'm going to go down to\nInternet Control Panel and I'm sorry,\n\n172\n00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.820\nI'm going to expand that out\n>> Security page, yeah.\n\n173\n00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.980\n>> And go to security page and then,\n\n174\n00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.150\nin here I've got site to\nzone assignment list.\n\n175\n00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.020\nAnd if I double-click on that\nthis is a policy that's a little\n\n176\n00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.380\ndifferent from the ones we've seen before.\n\n177\n00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.740\nWe have our normal not configured,\nenabled, disabled.\n\n178\n00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.510\nSo, I'll go ahead and enable it.\n\n179\n00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.050\nAll right?\n\n180\n00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:31.320\nBut then, I have to specify what URL and\nwhat zone I'm adding it to.\n\n181\n00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.350\nAnd I can add several URLs to\nanyone of those four zones.\n\n182\n00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.390\nSo, it's not as simple as just\nturning it on and turning it off.\n\n183\n00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.520\nI need to provide additional information.\n\n184\n00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:46.874\nSo, you click Show and\nthat opens up this little dialog box,\n\n185\n00:09:46.874 --> 00:09:52.980\nand in here I can type in,\nHTTPS://www.itpro.tv for\n\n186\n00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:57.980\nexample, and for\nthe value I'm gonna put a 2.\n\n187\n00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.110\nAnd everybody knows it's 2, right?\n\n188\n00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.208\nSo, we should be good to go.\n\n189\n00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:04.430\nJust kidding [LAUGH].\n\n190\n00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.970\nThey, instead of having to type out\nlike trusted or restricted or what or\n\n191\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:12.470\nhave you, right here again in the help,\nthe zones are numbered one through four.\n\n192\n00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:16.460\nSo, one is my intranet, two is trusted,\n\n193\n00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.980\nthree is internet, and\nfour is restricted sites.\n\n194\n00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.760\nSo, right there it tells me if I put a two\nit's going to add it to my trusted sites.\n\n195\n00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:29.370\nI put a three it's going to add it to\nthe Internet site or that zone, right.\n\n196\n00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.050\nSo, easy enough, we add the site,\nwe pick our zone and we click OK.\n\n197\n00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.330\nAnd we should be good to go.\n\n198\n00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.200\nAnd again, I'm just scratching\nthe service on IE settings.\n\n199\n00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.920\nYou can see,\nthere are several categories, and\n\n200\n00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.820\nwithin each category there\nare several actual settings.\n\n201\n00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:52.680\nSo, anything from pop-up settings\nto auto fill forms is another one.\n\n202\n00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.470\nI might want to turn that off.\n\n203\n00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:58.530\nTurn on the auto complete feature for\nuser names and passwords on forms.\n\n204\n00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.550\nWell, that's a security vulnerability,\nright?\n\n205\n00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:05.210\nIf IE is remembering, if they're\nchoosing to remember passwords in IE,\n\n206\n00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:08.590\nwhich they shouldn't be doing, that means\nif they leave themselves logged on,\n\n207\n00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.350\nsomebody comes up behind them,\nlaunches a browser,\n\n208\n00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:16.210\ntravels to their bank paid web page,\nit could auto log on for them, right?\n\n209\n00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:16.980\nWe can turn that off.\n\n210\n00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.390\nAnd you might think, well wait, Mike.\n\n211\n00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.280\nThis says turn on\nthe auto-complete feature.\n\n212\n00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.920\nThat's not what you wanna do.\n\n213\n00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.900\nBut look what it says.\n\n214\n00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.880\nIf you disable this setting,\nthe user cannot change the username and\n\n215\n00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.970\npasswords on forms, or\nprompt me to save passwords.\n\n216\n00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:34.430\nThe auto-complete feature for usernames\nand passwords on forms is turned off.\n\n217\n00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:39.630\nSo, even though, the name doesn't really,\nit might not sound like what I want to do.\n\n218\n00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.220\nIt actually does accomplish\nexactly what I want to do.\n\n219\n00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.880\nSo, I choose disabled and I click OK, and\n\n220\n00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.695\nnow they will no longer be able to ask IE\nto remember for those passwords for them.\n\n221\n00:11:50.695 --> 00:11:54.135\nSo, hundreds of settings\nthat we can do with IE.\n\n222\n00:11:54.135 --> 00:11:55.105\nLet's check it out, shall we?\n\n223\n00:11:55.105 --> 00:11:56.455\n>> Sure, sounds like a great idea.\n\n224\n00:11:56.455 --> 00:12:00.185\n>> All right, we'll close the editor,\nwe'll flip over to the client machine.\n\n225\n00:12:00.185 --> 00:12:04.195\nAnd we're just going to do\na little gpupdate here.\n\n226\n00:12:04.195 --> 00:12:06.955\nGpupdate, run that.\n\n227\n00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.700\nOr I could log off and log back on.\n\n228\n00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.900\nWe'll just, is this IE back there?\n\n229\n00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.850\nYeah, let's just close that.\n\n230\n00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.270\nAnd we'll let this policy refresh.\n\n231\n00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.920\nAnd then, we'll open up good old IE and\nnotice that, now this guy does not have\n\n232\n00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.260\ninternet access so it's going to fail,\nbut notice where it's trying to go.\n\n233\n00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:28.820\nRight?\nwww.ITPro.TV.\n\n234\n00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:33.530\nLet me go ahead and\nstop that navigation cuz it is gonna fail.\n\n235\n00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:34.750\nI go to my gear icon,\n\n236\n00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:39.970\nin my Internet Options, I can see that\nmy home page is indeed set to ITPro.TV.\n\n237\n00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:41.270\nAnd notice, I can't change it.\n\n238\n00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:42.620\nThat's the great thing about Group Policy.\n\n239\n00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.880\nIf I go to my security tab and\nI click on trusted sites and\n\n240\n00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:53.230\nsites Notice that https://www.itpro.tv\nis already listed in there, right?\n\n241\n00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.450\nAnd notice they can't change it,\neither, all right?\n\n242\n00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.280\nThat's something you wanna keep in mind.\n\n243\n00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.580\nBy setting that setting,\nyou might not have thought about that.\n\n244\n00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.850\nYes, I was able to\nsuccessfully add that site for\n\n245\n00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.900\nthem, now they can't add any other sites.\n\n246\n00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.120\nSo, now my list has to be inclusive.\n\n247\n00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.690\nRight?\nOr all-inclusive,\n\n248\n00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.910\nbecause they won't be able to\nmanually control that trusted sites.\n\n249\n00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:14.520\nAll right?\n\n250\n00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.700\n>> Now Mike, I have a question.\n\n251\n00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.110\nI was looking through some of the policy\nsettings that we were taking a look at.\n\n252\n00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:22.040\nSometimes, they're actually\nfairly redundant settings that we\n\n253\n00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.600\nmight also end up seeing.\n\n254\n00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.090\nSo, for example, I saw one here that\nsays disable the entire general page,\n\n255\n00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.858\nthat entire page here.\n\n256\n00:13:29.858 --> 00:13:32.470\nBut if you were to,\nlet's say what you did,\n\n257\n00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.065\nwhich is make sure that they\ncan't change the home page.\n\n258\n00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:38.295\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And do that other one.\n\n259\n00:13:38.295 --> 00:13:40.425\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Disable the entire general page.\n\n260\n00:13:40.425 --> 00:13:41.710\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n261\n00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.090\n>> Is that gonna cause some type\nof conflict or anything like that?\n\n262\n00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:45.990\n>> Nope, nope.\n\n263\n00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:48.480\nIf we look at my screen here,\nI've got that general page opened up.\n\n264\n00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.280\nAnd you'll notice that there are several\nsettings on this general page.\n\n265\n00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.510\nI could try to find, if I wanted to do\nindividuals like we did the home page but,\n\n266\n00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.900\nI don't care what their tab behavior is,\nright?\n\n267\n00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.850\nSo, it was easier just to disable or\nto preset the homepage for them.\n\n268\n00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.870\nIf I take the general tab away altogether,\n\n269\n00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.450\nthen they won't have access\nto any of these settings.\n\n270\n00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.090\nWhich might be easier than\ntrying to configure each one.\n\n271\n00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:15.880\nThe only thing you'd want to worry about\nRonnie, is if there was another way to\n\n272\n00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.900\nget to some of those settings, but\nas far as the conflict goes, nah.\n\n273\n00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.370\n>> Okay.\n>> The fact that you had set their home\n\n274\n00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:24.900\npage and taken away their general tab,\nthey'd be able to work just fine.\n\n275\n00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.610\nIt would set their home page to IT Pro and\n\n276\n00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:31.230\nit wouldn't even show them the general\ntab, so they wouldn't even know they\n\n277\n00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:34.185\ncouldn't change it, I guess, until they\ntried and the general tab was gone.\n\n278\n00:14:34.185 --> 00:14:35.560\n[LAUGH]\n>> Excellent.\n\n279\n00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.440\n>> So, Internet Explorer is\none of these browsers, right,\n\n280\n00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.610\nthat generally have on the system itself,\nit's a great way to be able to control,\n\n281\n00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.600\nof course, then the access and what\nthey can change for their browsing and\n\n282\n00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.210\nwhat they need, but that of course is not\nthe only settings that we can deal with.\n\n283\n00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.520\nOne of the other things that tends to\nhappen Mike is fairly simple, is I know\n\n284\n00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.010\nthat I've been working on a regular\ndesktop computer inside a business and\n\n285\n00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:02.430\nall of a sudden it pops up telling me hey,\nit's backing up, well not backed up but\n\n286\n00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:06.830\nupdates are waiting and they're available\nhere and I've seen people do it.\n\n287\n00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.470\nI've walked by and I say,\nhey, you've got updates.\n\n288\n00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:10.190\nOh, big deal and\n\n289\n00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.490\nthey just go ahead and keep-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n290\n00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.450\n>> Telling you hey, we'll do that later.\n\n291\n00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:16.657\n[CROSSTALK] We'll keep delaying it.\n\n292\n00:15:16.657 --> 00:15:18.838\nAnd I go back two days later and\nthey've still delayed it.\n\n293\n00:15:18.838 --> 00:15:19.900\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n294\n00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.310\n>> Is there a way I can control that?\n\n295\n00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.210\n>> Absolutely, and\njust like everything else,\n\n296\n00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:27.570\nif you can configure it on the machine,\nwe can configure it in group policy.\n\n297\n00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:30.040\nI can almost guarantee you that.\n\n298\n00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.540\nIt's just a matter of\nfinding that setting.\n\n299\n00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.570\nAnd updates, Ronnie, is a very common one.\n\n300\n00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:39.070\nA lot of times in corporate environments\nwe're using our own local update server.\n\n301\n00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.460\nAnd so, I have to tell the machines,\n\n302\n00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.000\nhey, don't go out to Microsoft,\ngo to my local server.\n\n303\n00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.960\nAnd even if we're not,\nas Ronnie said people will turn their\n\n304\n00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.370\nupdates off because someone told\nthem your machine will run so\n\n305\n00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.790\nmuch better, so much faster if\nyou disable automatic updates.\n\n306\n00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.920\nWe can't have that in my\ncorporate environment.\n\n307\n00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.278\nI've got to have those,\nat least the critical and\n\n308\n00:15:58.278 --> 00:16:00.365\nsecurity related have got to be installed.\n\n309\n00:16:00.365 --> 00:16:03.190\nSo, yes, absolutely we can control that.\n\n310\n00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.204\nLet's go up to my client's OU here,\ncreate a GPO.\n\n311\n00:16:06.204 --> 00:16:10.280\nAnd I'll call it Client Standards or\nsomething like that.\n\n312\n00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.480\nIf I could spell there.\n\n313\n00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.220\nAnd then we'll go back and\nwe'll edit that policy.\n\n314\n00:16:17.961 --> 00:16:22.110\nAnd it's just a matter of finding the\nsettings is really what it comes down to.\n\n315\n00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.360\nSo this'll be a computer configuration.\n\n316\n00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.560\nI'm gonna expand out Policies.\n\n317\n00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.540\nThis would be underneath\nmy Windows settings and\n\n318\n00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.680\nI'm sorry not my Windows settings my\nadministrative templates, and then Windows\n\n319\n00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.590\ncomponents, and now the bottom, almost\nthe bottom of this used to be the bottom\n\n320\n00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:43.338\nuntil they added work folders and work\nplace join, Windows update, all right,\n\n321\n00:16:43.338 --> 00:16:47.810\nand here I can find my settings,\nlike Configure Automatic Updates.\n\n322\n00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.440\nSo I just double click on that,\nand I choose enabled.\n\n323\n00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.650\nThis is another one that has additional\noptions once you turn it on, and\n\n324\n00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.820\nthese are probably,\nthey should look familiar to you.\n\n325\n00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.050\nThese are the same settings you get\non your client if you go in and\n\n326\n00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.270\nconfigure your update settings.\n\n327\n00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.480\nNotify for download and install.\n\n328\n00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.090\nAutomatically download and tell me\nwhen they're available for install,\n\n329\n00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:13.750\nauto download and schedule the install,\nor allow local admin to choose setting.\n\n330\n00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.820\nSo I'm just gonna do a number four,\nwhich means hey,\n\n331\n00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.330\nyou're gonna download them automatically\nand it's gonna schedule the install and\n\n332\n00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:23.240\nit's gonna install it when it's\ntime to install it, right?\n\n333\n00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.260\nThere's also some options to\nmake sure it only happens during\n\n334\n00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.370\nthe maintenance window.\n\n335\n00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.840\nSo we can set a maintenance\nwindow from 2 to 4 AM.\n\n336\n00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.930\nSo that nobody was using\nthe computer at the time.\n\n337\n00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.300\nHow often is it gonna check?\n\n338\n00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.400\nEvery day at 3 AM.\n\n339\n00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.810\nSo again, settings you've probably\nalready seen in your own Windows machine.\n\n340\n00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:44.080\nWe're just configuring\nit through group policy.\n\n341\n00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:50.110\nIf we go and I'm going to close that\npolicy, I'll flip back over to my client.\n\n342\n00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.070\nIf I do my Windows update settings now.\n\n343\n00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.670\nSee how long it takes to find that here.\n\n344\n00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.990\nThere we go, let's see if we can see it.\n\n345\n00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:06.510\nChoose Help, let's hit Install, let me get\nrid of Microsoft's little tutorial there.\n\n346\n00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.700\nNotice it says Automatically Install\nUpdates, but I can change it.\n\n347\n00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.140\nI want to set it to Never Install\nUpdates I hate Windows updates, and\n\n348\n00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.510\nit slows my machine down.\n\n349\n00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.100\nI don't want any of these updates,\nand then we'll go ahead and\n\n350\n00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.340\nclick Apply, right?\n\n351\n00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.650\nWell wait Mike, didn't you say that\nthat locks the user interface?\n\n352\n00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.106\nThat they shouldn't be able to do that?\n\n353\n00:18:23.106 --> 00:18:23.818\nI did.\n\n354\n00:18:23.818 --> 00:18:28.460\n[LAUGH] But, remember that policy\nhasn't kicked in yet, right?\n\n355\n00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:32.160\nIt was a computer setting which applies\nwhen the computer starts up, and\n\n356\n00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.840\nevery 90 to 120 minutes, or on a refresh.\n\n357\n00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.039\nSo let's just reboot\nthis machine real quick.\n\n358\n00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:39.950\nAnd see what happens now.\n\n359\n00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:41.560\nAll right?\n\n360\n00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.040\nAnd so once this thing restarts,\n\n361\n00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.850\nit'll restart pretty quick, we'll see\nif that setting actually takes place.\n\n362\n00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.400\nAnd again, it's a very common one to do\n\n363\n00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.360\nbecause most organizations run their\nown internal server, update server.\n\n364\n00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.600\nGives me a chance to approve updates,\ntest them before they go out.\n\n365\n00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.780\nBut even in small shops.\n\n366\n00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:02.310\nEven if you're not running your own update\nserver you might want those machines to\n\n367\n00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:06.670\nautomatically go out and at least check\nand maybe even install those updates.\n\n368\n00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.660\nAnd you don't want that user\ndisabling that setting.\n\n369\n00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.120\nSo if I log back in as Mr.\nRob here, my guinea pig for today\n\n370\n00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.489\nand we'll flip back here to\nmy windows update settings.\n\n371\n00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:23.850\nOnce it figures that out.\n\n372\n00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.230\nWe'll change the way\nupdates are installed,\n\n373\n00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.410\nget rid of my other little\ntutorial from Windows there.\n\n374\n00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.940\nNotice that even though I turned\nit off just a second ago,\n\n375\n00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.390\ninstall updates automatically recommended.\n\n376\n00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.040\nAnd I can't change it, all right?\n\n377\n00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.190\nSome settings are managed by\nyour system administrator.\n\n378\n00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.850\nI didn't say anything in the GPO\nabout recommended updates.\n\n379\n00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.000\nThey can turn those on or\noff if they want.\n\n380\n00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.150\nThey can have it update other\nproducts from Microsoft if they want.\n\n381\n00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.030\nAs far as their Windows updates,\nthey are going to get those and\n\n382\n00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:54.710\nthere's nothing they can do about it.\n\n383\n00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.260\nJust leave the machine disconnected for\n\n384\n00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.422\nthe remainder of their\nuse of that machine.\n\n385\n00:19:58.422 --> 00:19:59.418\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so\n\n386\n00:19:59.418 --> 00:20:03.454\none of the more important security\nconcepts that we wanna make sure of course\n\n387\n00:20:03.454 --> 00:20:04.970\nthat our users have.\n\n388\n00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.810\nBeing under control, the access and\nbeing able to set those things up in\n\n389\n00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:11.660\nInternet Explorer are also important for\nus, but another end user type of security\n\n390\n00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.240\nsetting we normally have to worry about\nof course is the Windows Firewall.\n\n391\n00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.990\nAnd I've seen that too Mike, where you've\ngone in and that little notification\n\n392\n00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:23.890\ninside of the system tray area, it says\nhey, Windows Firewall is not configured\n\n393\n00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.520\nthe way it needs to be please turn it on\nand they've done the same thing that we've\n\n394\n00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.500\ntalked about in which they said on\nsomebody said you can just turn it off and\n\n395\n00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.055\nthey showed me where to turn it off so\nwe just turned it off.\n\n396\n00:20:33.055 --> 00:20:37.520\n>> [LAUGH] And they will do that\nbecause somebody has mislead them and\n\n397\n00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.710\nthey think they're doing the right thing.\n\n398\n00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:44.210\nThey're really usually not trying to be\nmalicious but somebody's misinformed them.\n\n399\n00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:44.850\nSo let's take a look.\n\n400\n00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.730\nWe set a firewall right, Ronnie?\n\n401\n00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:49.770\nSo let's go back and\nI'll just use that same GPO.\n\n402\n00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:50.790\nI'm gonna click Edit.\n\n403\n00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.480\nAnd let's say we wanna\nmake a firewall exception.\n\n404\n00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.010\nWhat's a good one, Ronnie?\n\n405\n00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:56.520\nWhat do you think?\n\n406\n00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.030\n>> Let's talk about the remote desktop.\n\n407\n00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:58.840\nLet's do that.\n>> All right.\n\n408\n00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.070\nI like remote desktop.\n\n409\n00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.150\nWe'll go into policies.\n\n410\n00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:05.990\nThis one's gonna be under Windows\nsettings and then security settings, and\n\n411\n00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:08.520\nthen we've got out Windows\nfirewall with advanced security,\n\n412\n00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:12.500\nand then I've got my Windows firewall\nwith advanced security again.\n\n413\n00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:18.540\nAnd then I've got inbound rules, outbound\nrules, and connection security rules and\n\n414\n00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.840\nthese are gonna be just like the console\nyou would see on the client right?\n\n415\n00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.441\nIf I right click and say inbound new rule.\n\n416\n00:21:27.531 --> 00:21:31.265\nThis is the exact same wizard that would\nfire up if you were on an individual\n\n417\n00:21:31.265 --> 00:21:34.821\nmachine and you opened up your\nWindows Firewall Advanced Security and\n\n418\n00:21:34.821 --> 00:21:36.050\nsaid new rule.\n\n419\n00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:40.110\nWe're just doing it in a GPO\ninstead of on a specific machine.\n\n420\n00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:41.280\nSo I'll say we wanna do.\n\n421\n00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:46.390\nThere's probably a pre-defined rule for\na remote desktop would be a good guess.\n\n422\n00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.310\nLet's see.\n\n423\n00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:49.090\nThere we go, remote desktop.\n\n424\n00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:50.790\nI could also do it by port number.\n\n425\n00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.780\nI could do it be program.\n\n426\n00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.540\nI could list Microsoft Terminal Services\nclient in there.\n\n427\n00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.570\nRemember the big difference.\n\n428\n00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:59.830\nAnd this really isn't a firewall class,\nbut let's throw it in there anyway.\n\n429\n00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:06.160\nThe big difference there is if you do a\nport rule, then remote desktop uses 3389.\n\n430\n00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:13.310\nIf I do a port rule and enable 3389\ninbound, any program can come across 3389.\n\n431\n00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.510\nIt's always gonna be open.\n\n432\n00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:18.850\nIf I do a predefined or\none of these program rules,\n\n433\n00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:22.850\nnow it's not only looking at the port but\nthe program as well, and so it'll say yes,\n\n434\n00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.850\nI can open that port if you're\na remote desktop, right?\n\n435\n00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:27.340\nBut if anything else tries\nto use that port, so\n\n436\n00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.830\nit's a little more specific\nif you list a program.\n\n437\n00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:33.500\nThe predefined you'd have to\nlook at Microsoft's page and\n\n438\n00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.270\nsee exactly how it's doing.\n\n439\n00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:38.220\nAnd sometimes the predefined's are nice,\njust because if I don't know what\n\n440\n00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:42.550\nport number's associated with\nRemote service management.\n\n441\n00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:47.522\nOr some programs like to open up\nadditional ports for additional bandwidth.\n\n442\n00:22:47.522 --> 00:22:50.320\nSo 3389 might be its main port.\n\n443\n00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:52.500\nFTP will do this.\n\n444\n00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.710\nIt'll open up that 20 or 21, but\nthen some additional dynamic port,\n\n445\n00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:00.320\nsome high level unregistered ports,\njust for additional bandwidth.\n\n446\n00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.200\nIf I do a port number It can only\nup 2021 or 3389 in this case.\n\n447\n00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.540\nIf I do it by program,\nif that program says hey you know what,\n\n448\n00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:12.880\nI need some additional ports for some\nother connections, can you open up 59375?\n\n449\n00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.320\nIt'll let it.\n\n450\n00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.560\nBecause the rule says hey the program,\nnot the actually port number.\n\n451\n00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.130\nAnyway, so back to this we'll do\npredefined, we'll do remote desktop,\n\n452\n00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:24.640\nwe'll click next, and\nyou can see it's got these three rules.\n\n453\n00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:29.620\nIf I didn't want all three of those I\ncould undo one of them or two of them.\n\n454\n00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.620\nWe could uncheck those guys.\n\n455\n00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.140\nWe'll click Next.\n\n456\n00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.350\nNow I wanna allow it, block it,\nallow if it's secure.\n\n457\n00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:38.530\nI'm just gonna choose allow and finish.\n\n458\n00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:43.030\nAgain, no different from the normal\nwizard you would use on the client.\n\n459\n00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:48.470\nBut now it's in a policy and\nthat policy is linked to the clients OU.\n\n460\n00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.470\nAnd you know what Ronnie,\nwhat I just realized?\n\n461\n00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.980\nThat's right,\nI was thinking that was my employee's OU.\n\n462\n00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.991\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you know I can have hundreds of\n\n463\n00:23:56.991 --> 00:24:02.520\ncomputers in GMV, thousand of computers\nin my New York office, whatever.\n\n464\n00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.293\nOne rule set up and I just applied\nthat rule to all the machines.\n\n465\n00:24:06.293 --> 00:24:10.472\nWe make new computers and we drag and\ndrop them into these OUs.\n\n466\n00:24:10.472 --> 00:24:11.840\nAnd guess what?\n\n467\n00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.930\nThat rule's gonna be in place, right?\n\n468\n00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:16.170\nThat's the beauty of Group Policy.\n\n469\n00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:17.530\nLet's go check it out over here,\n\n470\n00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.280\nI've still got my\nWindows Update thing going on.\n\n471\n00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.610\nIf I can get this to, I'm having an issue\ntrying to close this silly window.\n\n472\n00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:27.570\nLet's see if I can get.\n\n473\n00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:28.780\nThere we go.\n\n474\n00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:29.800\nWhat do we do?\n\n475\n00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:35.790\nWe set a Windows firewall rule, so\nlet's go back over to that desktop and\n\n476\n00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:43.700\nwe'll do Windows firewall, and we'll do\nWindows firewall with advanced security.\n\n477\n00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.989\nWhich it doesn't like me to find so\nwe'll go to the firewall first and\n\n478\n00:24:46.989 --> 00:24:48.919\nthen we'll choose advance settings and\n\n479\n00:24:48.919 --> 00:24:52.796\nwe'll authenticate as administrators\nbecause I'm logged on as Rob right now.\n\n480\n00:24:58.091 --> 00:25:00.506\nAnd we'll take a look at inbound rules.\n\n481\n00:25:00.506 --> 00:25:06.130\nAnd we'll scroll down and\nwe will find remote desktop.\n\n482\n00:25:08.505 --> 00:25:11.430\nAnd keep on going, keep on going.\n\n483\n00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:12.770\nAnd it's not there.\n\n484\n00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:13.517\nAny guesses as to why.\n\n485\n00:25:13.517 --> 00:25:14.017\n>> We haven't.\n\n486\n00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.782\n>> Go ahead.\n>> We haven't refreshed policy yet.\n\n487\n00:25:18.782 --> 00:25:20.088\n>> Alright.\n[CROSSTALK] That's right.\n\n488\n00:25:20.088 --> 00:25:22.740\nI made that policy then just over here\nit said hey let's go check it out.\n\n489\n00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:26.690\nLet's just do a GP update this time,\nwe won't reboot the machine.\n\n490\n00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.690\nSo we'll do a,\nactually I'm logged on as Rob.\n\n491\n00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:30.880\nHe's not an administrator.\n\n492\n00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.225\nSo let me just reboot the machine.\n\n493\n00:25:32.225 --> 00:25:33.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Otherwise,\n\n494\n00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.950\nI'm gonna have to do a Run As for that.\n\n495\n00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:38.350\nThis will be quicker for\nour little demonstration.\n\n496\n00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:39.710\nAnd it's easy to forget.\n\n497\n00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:41.390\nYou see me forgetting it.\n\n498\n00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:43.770\nYou go in, you work on a policy,\nyou make some change to it.\n\n499\n00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:46.730\nAnd you wanna go test it out\nimmediately to see if it works.\n\n500\n00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:49.460\nWe can't forget when policies apply.\n\n501\n00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:53.620\nComputer settings, when the computer\nstarts, and then every 90 to 120 minutes.\n\n502\n00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.660\nUser settings apply when a user\nlogs on at every 90 to 120 minutes.\n\n503\n00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.780\nSo if you're doing it at a computer\nsetting and you go log the user off,\n\n504\n00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.540\nthen log them back on, it's not gonna\ndo any good for computer settings.\n\n505\n00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:08.170\nSo you gotta do your GP update or\nyou gotta restart that machine.\n\n506\n00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:11.420\nBut it's really easy to forget that,\nas you see.\n\n507\n00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:15.640\n>> Now Mike, also something\nthat you mentioned a little bit\n\n508\n00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:20.100\nearlier about the scope in which we\naccidentally can set those links to, and\n\n509\n00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:24.950\nI know that I've done that before, where\nI said, hey, I did create that policy and\n\n510\n00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:28.260\nI didn't realize that I had set it to\nthe wrong OU where it won't apply.\n\n511\n00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.540\nAnd there it is, I'm racking my brain out.\n\n512\n00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:34.120\nSo you got to follow it back every time\nthat you do have something that's not\n\n513\n00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.210\napplying correctly.\n\n514\n00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:36.560\nMake sure you take a look at each and\n\n515\n00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.850\nevery step and then once that's done,\nthen you'll actually probably see,\n\n516\n00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:45.730\noh yeah I remember there are no computers\nin that OU and that can be an issue.\n\n517\n00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:47.580\n>> It's a very easy mistake.\n\n518\n00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:52.070\nIn fact I think I've probably made it\ntwo or three times on this show and\n\n519\n00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.140\nlet me remember my\nadministrators password here.\n\n520\n00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.750\nWhere yeah, you scope into the wrong.\n\n521\n00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:01.810\nYou make a user setting but you link\nit to the OU where the computer is and\n\n522\n00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.060\nyou wonder why the heck is\nthat setting not kicking in?\n\n523\n00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:04.590\nRight.\n\n524\n00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:05.950\nSo it's very easy to do.\n\n525\n00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:10.050\nAnd that's where the RSOP, you'll see one\nof the first things that I always do.\n\n526\n00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:11.540\nPop open a command prompt and\n\n527\n00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:15.650\nrun that GP result to see if\nthe policy's even trying to apply.\n\n528\n00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:19.580\nIf the name of the policy isn't listed\nthere, then I know immediately, that hey,\n\n529\n00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.200\nI probably scoped it incorrectly, or\nthere's a lack of network connectivity.\n\n530\n00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.790\nSomething's not right and\nI'm gonna check it out.\n\n531\n00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:28.960\nYou probably saw when I first\nlogged into this Windows firewall,\n\n532\n00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:31.560\nit said some settings controlled\nby your administrator.\n\n533\n00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.810\nThat's a dead giveaway that\nsomething's going on with policy.\n\n534\n00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:39.930\nIf I scroll down here, and we look at\nremote desktop, I'll see there it is.\n\n535\n00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:44.250\nIt is turned on,\nthere's the three rules that we enabled.\n\n536\n00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.540\nIn fact if I double click on this,\nnotice I can't turn it off.\n\n537\n00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:51.450\nJust like any other setting we've\ndone with a Group Policy setting,\n\n538\n00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.130\nit locks the user interface.\n\n539\n00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:55.280\nAny of those other rules,\nsure they can change them.\n\n540\n00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.880\nTurn them on, turn them off, whatever.\n\n541\n00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.970\nThese three rules that I applied through\na Group Policy, they can't undo it, right?\n\n542\n00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.960\nThat's the beauty of group policy.\n\n543\n00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.510\n>> Now this is one I have seen and\nthe very fact is or\n\n544\n00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.730\nthe scenario that we use really did\nhappen where somebody said oh no,\n\n545\n00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:12.458\nwe're allowed to use remote desktop\n>> And I checked and\n\n546\n00:28:12.458 --> 00:28:14.339\nthey had just turned the firewall off so\n\n547\n00:28:14.339 --> 00:28:18.140\nthat they could get access in instead\nof actually just creating a rule.\n\n548\n00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:22.153\nAnd so what we had to do is we had to go\nand let the network administrator know,\n\n549\n00:28:22.153 --> 00:28:25.830\ninstead all we need to do is open\nup just for that application.\n\n550\n00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.950\nWe don't need for people to randomly\nturn the entire firewall off, and\n\n551\n00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.340\nit's like is that actually happening?\n\n552\n00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.360\nAnd I said yes.\n\n553\n00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.640\nIt's really happening.\n\n554\n00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.070\nIt's amazing.\n\n555\n00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.370\n>> It's a scary thing.\n\n556\n00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.110\nI mean I've seen forums.\n\n557\n00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.730\nUsers that don't know much better,\nwhat are they gonna do?\n\n558\n00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:43.050\nSomething's not working,\nthey're gonna go over the internet and\n\n559\n00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:44.290\nthey're gonna do a search.\n\n560\n00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:48.410\nAnd then you'll find some persons, some\nbrainiac that's got a post out there that\n\n561\n00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:52.040\nsays, oh if you turn your\nfirewall it should work fine.\n\n562\n00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.980\nWell sure, it'll work.\n\n563\n00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:58.510\nBut your firewall is turned off,\nyou have no security now whatsoever.\n\n564\n00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.250\nIt's not the way you\nwanna fix the process.\n\n565\n00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:05.670\nIt's a very good example, Ronnie, and one\nof the great things about group policy.\n\n566\n00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:09.500\n>> All right, Mike, so there's a lot\nthere, there's a lot of settings.\n\n567\n00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.030\nAnd I'm glad you know them all, but\n\n568\n00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:15.470\nsomebody like me, it's gonna take a little\nbit of time to actually be able to learn.\n\n569\n00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:17.410\nYou can see how we can\ncontrol the desktop and\n\n570\n00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:21.470\nMike did tell us anything that we can\nactually do and configure for a regular\n\n571\n00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:26.260\nuser, we can also probably control it\nthrough the actual group policy settings.\n\n572\n00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.530\nThe key here is to remember\nthe syntax that you're also seeing.\n\n573\n00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.360\nIt will be confusing at times,\nwhere you'll see something like\n\n574\n00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:37.025\ndisable the ability the ability\nto change the homepage.\n\n575\n00:29:37.025 --> 00:29:40.590\n[LAUGH] And then inside of it you'll\nsee enable, disable and, you know,\n\n576\n00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:41.680\nnot configured.\n\n577\n00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.390\nAnd just read those descriptions,\n\n578\n00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:47.170\nmake sure it's actually going to do\nwhat you think it's going to do as well.\n\n579\n00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:48.080\nCheck out the scope.\n\n580\n00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.630\nVerify that if you are setting\nuser configurations there,\n\n581\n00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:55.440\nmake sure you actually are setting it to\nwhatever, OU or the domain, you know.\n\n582\n00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.490\nWherever you actually have users and\nthe computers as well,\n\n583\n00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:00.250\nmake sure you do the other thing too.\n\n584\n00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:03.340\nSo there's a lot of different settings and\nwe just used three examples.\n\n585\n00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.840\n>> Absolutely and\nRonnie brings up an excellent point.\n\n586\n00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.980\nTest them before you put them in\na production environment, right?\n\n587\n00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:13.740\nHave yourself an OU with a machine\nthat's sitting in your office.\n\n588\n00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:17.170\nPut that machine in an OU,\nhave a user account whatever you gotta do.\n\n589\n00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:21.260\nTest them first before you\nimplement them out because,\n\n590\n00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.810\nwhen you're configuring\nsettings directly on a machine,\n\n591\n00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:27.490\nyou can affect that machine and\nanybody that logs on to it.\n\n592\n00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:29.360\nSo, if I goof up a firewall rule,\n\n593\n00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:33.230\nanybody who sits at this machine is going\nto have trouble with remote desktop.\n\n594\n00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:34.220\nOkay.\n\n595\n00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.685\nIf I make a policy and\nI link it to the domain.\n\n596\n00:30:36.685 --> 00:30:38.546\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I goof something up.\n\n597\n00:30:38.546 --> 00:30:41.717\nI didn't bring down one machine I brought\ndown every machine in the entire network,\n\n598\n00:30:41.717 --> 00:30:43.339\nright, depending on what the setting is.\n\n599\n00:30:43.339 --> 00:30:46.803\nSo my point is you really wanna\ntest it because the great\n\n600\n00:30:46.803 --> 00:30:51.715\nthing about Group Policy is I can do\ncentralized configuration management.\n\n601\n00:30:51.715 --> 00:30:56.954\nThe dangerous thing about Group Policy\nis I'm doing centralized configuration\n\n602\n00:30:56.954 --> 00:31:01.731\nmanagement and when I make a mistake,\nthe scope could be far-reaching so\n\n603\n00:31:01.731 --> 00:31:04.130\ntest test test [LAUGH]\n>> Excellent.\n\n604\n00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:06.250\nWell thank you Mike for\nshowing us those demonstrations and\n\n605\n00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:10.390\nfor showing us those locations inside of\nGroup Policy that we can really affect and\n\n606\n00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.840\ncontrol what our end users are doing.\n\n607\n00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:16.200\nThank you for watching this today,\nand that's a great place

00:00:20.391\nI'm you host Ronnie Wong, and today we're\ngoing to be taking a look at working with\n\n4\n00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:24.576\ngroup policy, now specifically, we're\ngoing to be talking about

control of\n\n7\n00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.550\nwhat goes on our end user's computers\nto the point where we need to lock\n\n8\n00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.194\nit down the way that we're talking about?\n\n9\n00:00:36.194 --> 00:00:39.350\n[LAUGH] It's all good, just let them\ndo what they want, it'll be OK.\n\n10\n00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.160\nI mean, why not?\n\n11\n00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.750\nWhat's the harm in actually going out to\na website that we've never been on before?\n\n12\n00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.790\nAnd somebody says, oh that looks\nlike an application I wanna try,\n\n13\n00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.090\nand let them installing it.\n\n14\n00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.050\nYeah, right.\nSounds good.\n\n15\n00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.740\nExactly, and\nthat's really the problem, right.\n\n16\n00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.630\nWhen it comes down to it,\n\n17\n00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.310\nI wanna be able to control what\nthey're running on my systems.\n\n18\n00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.660\nI wanna know what applications are running\nbecause they could include malware, right.\n\n19\n00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.460\nIf they're going out and getting some\nfree program from some unknown site.\n\n20\n00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.270\nThere could be back doors built into that,\nsome kind of malware built into it.\n\n21\n00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.260\nAnd not only that,\nwhat about licensing, right?\n\n22\n00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.190\nI wanna be able to control\nwhat applications are running.\n\n23\n00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.560\nI don't want somebody running\nunlicensed software on my network,\n\n24\n00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.625\ncuz guess who's gonna get in trouble,\nright?\n\n25\n00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:17.890\n[LAUGH].\nIt's gonna be the organization\n\n26\n00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.700\nthat's paying those fines\n\n27\n00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.170\nthat's providing these machines\nthat's running unlicensed software.\n\n28\n00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.290\nI don't really want them running iTunes.\n\n29\n00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.560\nI don't want them installing\niTunes on their machine at work.\n\n30\n00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.700\nOr World of Warcraft, or whatever\nthe latest and greatest game is out there.\n\n31\n00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.080\nThat's not what these machines are for,\nthey're supposed to be doing work.\n\n32\n00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.800\nSo, it's not that I really\nwant to lock them down and\n\n33\n00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.550\nmake it painful, but at the same time,\nI've got to keep the system safe.\n\n34\n00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.440\nI've got to keep everything up and\nrunning and efficient, and\n\n35\n00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.230\nif we're running Malware-loaded\nsoftware or unlicensed software or\n\n36\n00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.280\ngames and things like that, that's\ntaking away from their productivity and\n\n37\n00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.500\ncould possibly be taking away from\nnetwork resources or something else.\n\n38\n00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.380\nThose are things that I wanna\nbe able to control, and\n\n39\n00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.800\nmy Windows gives us some really cool ways\nto do that built in to group policy.\n\n40\n00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.120\nNow Mike, I do remember a situation\nwhich we had someone come in and\n\n41\n00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.600\ninstall software that they\nhad brought from home, and\n\n42\n00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.110\nit ended up causing\na troubleshooting issue as well.\n\n43\n00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.830\nThe very fact that now, that machine,\nwe weren't able to figure out what was\n\n44\n00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.440\nactually running in the background, and\nthey still kept getting the same error,\n\n45\n00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.140\nand we knew that our machine\nwas supposed to be identical.\n\n46\n00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.180\nBut one thing we had to actually implement\nwhich you were talking about here\n\n47\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.780\nwas some way to say look lets make sure\nthat this is not going to happen again.\n\n48\n00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.680\nBecause if nothing else, it just\ncaused a major troubleshooting issue.\n\n49\n00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.490\nSo, for us, it's not only\nabout security a lot of times.\n\n50\n00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.000\nIf you have that odd machine and\nyou don't know what's running on it,\n\n51\n00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.300\nand you're supposed to know what's\nrunning on it well that gets put on you.\n\n52\n00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.090\nLike, why didn't you know that\nthat was on that computer.\n\n53\n00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.770\nI didn't even think to check on it.\n\n54\n00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.640\nThis is one way we can\nactually ensure that.\n\n55\n00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.290\nAbsolutely.\n\n56\n00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.530\nSo, let's talk about the different ways\nwe can go about controlling the software\n\n57\n00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.970\nthat's allowed to run on our systems.\n\n58\n00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.350\nThere's really two different ways\nwe're going to look at this.\n\n59\n00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.860\nThe first one is going to be\nsoftware restriction policies.\n\n60\n00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.750\nNow, these have been around for\n\n61\n00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.770\na little while, they go back to\nthe XP days and prior to that.\n\n62\n00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.220\nAnd they allowed us to do just that,\nto control\n\n63\n00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.240\nwhat type of software was installed or\nwas allowed to run on our machine.\n\n64\n00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.390\nAnd let's go take a look at it.\n\n65\n00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.210\nIf I open up a group policy here, so\nI'm gonna go into Group Policy Management.\n\n66\n00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.550\nAnd I'll navigate my way over to my\nOU that contains my client machines.\n\n67\n00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.160\nAnd we'll just make a new GPO here.\n\n68\n00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.220\nAnd I'll call it,\nSoftware Restriction, and\n\n69\n00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.780\nthen we'll go in and\nwe'll edit that policy.\n\n70\n00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.590\nThe settings we're looking for\nis going to be under Windows,\n\n71\n00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.100\nif I'm in the computer half, Policies,\nWindows Settings, Security Settings.\n\n72\n00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.340\nThen, down towards the bottom,\nI've got my Software Restriction Policies.\n\n73\n00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.730\nWhen you get here, when you first come in,\nthere's nothing to find.\n\n74\n00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.830\nSo, the first thing you do\nis right click on that and\n\n75\n00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.890\nchoose new software restriction policies.\n\n76\n00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.270\nAnd that's going to as you can see\ncreate a couple of nodes here.\n\n77\n00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.030\nAnd there's a few different things.\n\n78\n00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.750\nThere's the security levels.\n\n79\n00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.940\nThese are what show up in a drop down\nlist when we go to block a program.\n\n80\n00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.600\nI'll show you what I mean in a second.\n\n81\n00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.770\nThere's disallowed,\n\n82\n00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.440\nSoftware will not run regardless\nof the access rights of the user.\n\n83\n00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.420\nThere's basic user which means if you,\na lot of programs to execute as\n\n84\n00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.230\na user that does not have\nadministrative access rights but\n\n85\n00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.480\ncan still access resources\navailable to normal users and\n\n86\n00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.070\nthen there's unrestricted,\nanybody can run what have you.\n\n87\n00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.650\nOr anybody can run it.\n\n88\n00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.990\nThen, there's my rules folder and\nit starts out with two.\n\n89\n00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.650\nAnd you'll see these are going\ninto Microsoft Windows NT,\n\n90\n00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.360\nyou can see these registry keys here.\n\n91\n00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.000\nCurrent version system root,\nthat's be my C column windows.\n\n92\n00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.090\nAnd then, there's current version program\nfiles dir, directory which would be C\n\n93\n00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.300\ncolumn program files and you can see\nthere's some security levels set to\n\n94\n00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.910\nunrestricted so it starts out by saying\nall right I'm gonna create a white list.\n\n95\n00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.680\nAnything that's already\nin the windows directory,\n\n96\n00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.070\nanything that's already in the Program\nFiles directory, those are allowed to run.\n\n97\n00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.700\nThat's good, right?\n\n98\n00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.460\nI want to be able to\nlaunch my software here,\n\n99\n00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.090\nI want to be able to run Windows itself,\nthings like that.\n\n100\n00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.260\nAnd then, what we would do,\n\n101\n00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.970\nis we can create additional rules when\nI wanna block a particular application.\n\n102\n00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.640\nAnd I first have to figure out how\nI wanna identify the software.\n\n103\n00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.530\nFor software restrictions,\nI've got certificate rule,\n\n104\n00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.990\nwhich would be if that software had been\ndigitally signed with a certificate.\n\n105\n00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.360\nI could trust that certificate or\nallow it to run or\n\n106\n00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.760\nblock it based on that certificate.\n\n107\n00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.640\nThere's a hash rule which means\nwe'll run the executable.\n\n108\n00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.520\nThrough a hashing out rhythm\ngenerate a signature for that file,\n\n109\n00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.320\nand we can block or allow based on that.\n\n110\n00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.290\nThere's network zone rule, which would\nbe where did I get the program from?\n\n111\n00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.160\nAll right, if I downloaded from the\ninternet zone versus the intranet zone.\n\n112\n00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.410\nWhen it comes to IE security.\n\n113\n00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.200\nAnd then, there's the new path\nrule which is where it's located.\n\n114\n00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.640\nLike C colon, program files, X 86,\n\n115\n00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.580\nWorld of Warcraft,\nwhatever the actual executable is located.\n\n116\n00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:12.380\nMost of these like certificate, hash,\nthose are pretty good ways to identify.\n\n117\n00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.390\nThe one thing I wanna point out here,\nthe path rule is the one that's probably\n\n118\n00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.820\nthe easiest to do cuz the software doesn't\nhave to be signed or anything like that.\n\n119\n00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.840\nI can just say this is where\nthat executable resides,\n\n120\n00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.370\nI don't want to allow it to run.\n\n121\n00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.400\nThe downside of that though is if they've\ngot administrative access to the machine,\n\n122\n00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.980\nif they're a local admin,\nif they're allowed to install software.\n\n123\n00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.440\nThey can install it to\na different location.\n\n124\n00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.400\nAll right?\nYou guys know,\n\n125\n00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.300\nyou've installed software before.\n\n126\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.830\nWhen you go to install it, you say,\nthis here's the default path.\n\n127\n00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:41.820\nBut you can always change that.\n\n128\n00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.130\nAnd if I change where\nthe executable is located,\n\n129\n00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.560\nwell it no longer matches my rule.\n\n130\n00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.270\nAnd it would be allowed.\n\n131\n00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.220\nSo, something to keep in\nmind with that path rule.\n\n132\n00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:51.700\nAll right?\n\n133\n00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.370\nThese rules again, XP and prior.\n\n134\n00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.850\nAfter XP when we get into Vista and\nbeyond, so 7, 8, Windows 10,\n\n135\n00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.790\nwe start getting into AppLocker.\n\n136\n00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.670\nAnd AppLocker gives us\na little bit more control.\n\n137\n00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:10.940\nAppLocker is basically the evolved\nform of software restriction policies.\n\n138\n00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.080\nThey've made it a little more robust,\na little bit better,\n\n139\n00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.910\nthey've changed a few things.\n\n140\n00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.260\nSo, it does the exact same thing.\n\n141\n00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.260\nIt's designed to prevent or allow software\nfrom being run, but it's the new and\n\n142\n00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.370\nimproved version of software\nrestriction policies.\n\n143\n00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.150\nSo, then the question is why do we still\nhave software restriction policies then?\n\n144\n00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.320\nBecause XP and prior won't\nunderstand the ad blocker rules.\n\n145\n00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.390\nSo, we have to be able to do both.\n\n146\n00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.790\nIf we've got a mixed environment,\nwhere we've got Windows 8 clients and\n\n147\n00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.880\nWindows XP clients, if I wanna block\nnotepad, for example, I can use adblocker.\n\n148\n00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.245\nThat won't block it on Windows XP,\nit'll just be Windows Vista and later.\n\n149\n00:07:48.245 --> 00:07:51.837\nSo, I'll have to create\na separate policy for\n\n150\n00:07:51.837 --> 00:07:57.008\nthe software restriction policies\nto block that from Windows XP.\n\n151\n00:07:57.008 --> 00:08:00.827\nSo that's software restriction and again,\nI just want you to be aware of it that\n\n152\n00:08:00.827 --> 00:08:03.335\nit's there if you've got\nthat mixed environment,\n\n153\n00:08:03.335 --> 00:08:05.990\nyou're gonna need those\nolder type policies.\n\n154\n00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:10.320\nBut in our current operating systems,\n\n155\n00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.780\nwe're gonna be using application control\npolicies and they work very similar.\n\n156\n00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.100\nI'm gonna come down here to explore.\n\n157\n00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.360\nYou can see that I've just gone\ndown a little bit further.\n\n158\n00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.670\nHere's my application control policies,\nunderneath that is AppLocker.\n\n159\n00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.502\nYou see it looks a lot different when\nyou're working with it in the policy here.\n\n160\n00:08:26.502 --> 00:08:31.800\nI'm gonna expand this out, and\nthese are my rules that I have.\n\n161\n00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.340\nI've got executable rules which\nwould define the executable.\n\n162\n00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.390\nI wanna block nopad.exe for example.\n\n163\n00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.210\nThe name of the executable,\nand not just EXEs though.\n\n164\n00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:47.700\nThere are several classes that\nwould fall under the .exe.\n\n165\n00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.291\nThere's also Windows installers.\n\n166\n00:08:50.291 --> 00:08:53.590\nYour MSI files to keep them\nfrom installing applications.\n\n167\n00:08:53.590 --> 00:09:00.851\nThere are script rules to prevent like\nrunning bats, .bat's, or cmd's or ps1's.\n\n168\n00:09:00.851 --> 00:09:05.438\nThere's also packaged app rules for\nthose new Ronnie what you call that?\n\n169\n00:09:05.438 --> 00:09:10.151\n>> Universal in Windows 10 and\nof course the modern UI type of apps.\n\n170\n00:09:10.151 --> 00:09:10.963\n>> There you go.\n\n171\n00:09:10.963 --> 00:09:12.519\nThey've changed-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n172\n00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:13.146\n>> The name of those a few times.\n\n173\n00:09:13.146 --> 00:09:13.889\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n174\n00:09:13.889 --> 00:09:15.640\n>> Like what do you want\nto call it now Microsoft?\n\n175\n00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.090\nThose new apps you get from the store.\n\n176\n00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Those are our packaged apps.\n\n177\n00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.610\nSo setting these up is not too bad but\n\n178\n00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:27.100\nthere are few things we've got to\nbe aware of to make all this work.\n\n179\n00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.960\nThe first thing is, let's say for\nthis one we'll block notepad.\n\n180\n00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.612\n>> Sounds good.\n>> An easy one just to test it out.\n\n181\n00:09:34.612 --> 00:09:38.140\nSo I'm gonna do it based on an executable.\n\n182\n00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.180\nSo I'll right click over here, and\nI see I've got a couple options.\n\n183\n00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.920\nI've got Create New Rule,\nAutomatically Generate Rules,\n\n184\n00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.909\nand then Create Default Rules.\n\n185\n00:09:46.909 --> 00:09:50.764\nThe first thing we have to understand\nis that this works on an implicit deny\n\n186\n00:09:50.764 --> 00:09:51.267\nsystem.\n\n187\n00:09:51.267 --> 00:09:53.347\nSo once I start blocking things,\n\n188\n00:09:53.347 --> 00:09:58.550\nit could end up locking everything else\nif I don't specifically allow something,\n\n189\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:03.370\nit'll end up trying to block it so\nwe've gotta be careful with that.\n\n190\n00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:08.070\nAnd to help us or to make sure we can\ncontinue to use our operating system and\n\n191\n00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.352\nthe applications that\nalready exist on our machine.\n\n192\n00:10:10.352 --> 00:10:13.670\nWe wanna make sure we\ncreate those default rules.\n\n193\n00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.900\nSo the first thing you do when\nyou start setting up AppLocker,\n\n194\n00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.570\nis create default rules.\n\n195\n00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.650\nIn most scenarios, there might be\ntimes when you don't want these, but\n\n196\n00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.290\nlet's see what they are here.\n\n197\n00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.300\nThe first one says, allow everyone\n\n198\n00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.930\nall files located in the program\nfiles folder so c:program files.\n\n199\n00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.940\nAll the stuff that's already\ninstalled on the machines.\n\n200\n00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:38.381\nAllow everyone all files\nlocated in the Windows folder.\n\n201\n00:10:38.381 --> 00:10:39.124\n>> Makes sense.\n[LAUGH]\n\n202\n00:10:39.124 --> 00:10:39.727\n>> Yeah, right?\n\n203\n00:10:39.727 --> 00:10:42.610\nAllow my operating system to run.\n\n204\n00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:47.200\nAnd then the last one is a free pass for\nthe built in administrators group.\n\n205\n00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.040\nAnybody in the local admins group,\ncan run anything so it's a free pass.\n\n206\n00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.357\nAnd that's an important one to remember.\n\n207\n00:10:53.357 --> 00:10:55.134\n>> It is.\n>> Cuz I will tell you Ronnie,\n\n208\n00:10:55.134 --> 00:10:58.685\nI know sometimes I've beating my\nhead against a desk testing out some\n\n209\n00:10:58.685 --> 00:11:02.107\nof these rules and you go over to\nthe client machine and you log on and\n\n210\n00:11:02.107 --> 00:11:04.397\nyou're like why isn't this rule working?\n\n211\n00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:06.890\nOh yeah, I'm in the local admins group.\n\n212\n00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.790\nOops.\n[LAUGH] You get that free pass.\n\n213\n00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.290\nSo if you set up these default rules,\n\n214\n00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.100\nthat's gonna make sure that my\noperating system still functions.\n\n215\n00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.830\nAll my apps that are there still function.\n\n216\n00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:20.350\nAnd then you go back and start blocking\nwhatever it is you need to block.\n\n217\n00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.560\nAnd there are default rules for\neach one of these.\n\n218\n00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:28.353\nSo each one of these classes I can\ngo in and create default rules for\n\n219\n00:11:28.353 --> 00:11:31.067\nWindows installers, for scripts.\n\n220\n00:11:31.067 --> 00:11:33.891\nYou can say,\nall scripts located in the program files,\n\n221\n00:11:33.891 --> 00:11:36.910\nall scripts located in Windows,\ngo ahead and allow those.\n\n222\n00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.360\nPackaged app rules has a default rule.\n\n223\n00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.690\nFor all signed package apps, so\n\n224\n00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.500\nif as long as it's digitally\nsigned you should be good to go.\n\n225\n00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.370\nWe're gonna focus again on the Executable.\n\n226\n00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.300\nSo let's say, we wanna block Notepad.\n\n227\n00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.860\nI'm gonna choose Create New Rule.\n\n228\n00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.260\nI've already got my defaults there and\nit launches a handy wizard.\n\n229\n00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.930\nI'll click Next, and\nwhat do I wanna do Allow or Deny?\n\n230\n00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.220\nI'm gonna choose Deny.\n\n231\n00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.940\nAnd then who do I want to deny?\n\n232\n00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.520\nI can deny just a specific group of users,\nan individual user,\n\n233\n00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.740\nagain we should follow best practices and\ndo groups.\n\n234\n00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:15.162\nI'm just gonna block everyone for\nthis particular demo, and I'll click Next.\n\n235\n00:12:15.162 --> 00:12:18.190\nAnd then how do I want to\nidentify the application?\n\n236\n00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.970\nThere's publisher,\nwhich is who created it?\n\n237\n00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.340\nWho signed that executable?\n\n238\n00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.720\nI'm gonna pull back the metadata on\nthat executable, so you've made it.\n\n239\n00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.914\nThere's a path rule.\n\n240\n00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:29.630\nThe same thing applies here.\n\n241\n00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:34.160\nThe path rule works fine, but remember if\nthey move that executable somewhere else,\n\n242\n00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.340\nit no longer matches your path rule and\n\n243\n00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.780\nit's gonna allow that application and\nthen there's also a file hash rule.\n\n244\n00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.160\nIf you've got an application\nthat's not signed, so\n\n245\n00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.550\nI can't use this publisher option.\n\n246\n00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:50.340\nIt can run the application through\na hashing algorithm, generate a value and\n\n247\n00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.820\nthen use that, so either way you wanna go.\n\n248\n00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.660\nWe'll go ahead and we'll do publisher,\nand we'll click Next.\n\n249\n00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.290\nAnd then my reference file in fact I will\nshow you a couple of these ways here.\n\n250\n00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:06.050\nWe'll only just end up choosing one but\npublisher,\n\n251\n00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.930\nnotice it gives me a reference file.\n\n252\n00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.070\nI click Browse, and I go find\n\n253\n00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:16.570\nthat executable which is\nWindows system 32, Notepad.\n\n254\n00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.540\nThere is my little executable,\nand notice what it does.\n\n255\n00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.020\nIt fills in all this information\nfrom the executable.\n\n256\n00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:28.000\nI can see the version number, the file\nname, the product name, the publisher.\n\n257\n00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.220\nAnd I've got this handy slider here.\n\n258\n00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:34.614\nThis will block everything Notepad 6.3 and\nhigher.\n\n259\n00:13:34.614 --> 00:13:37.540\nWell, what if I wanna block older\nversions of Notepad as well?\n\n260\n00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.690\nI can actually modify these\nvalues If I want to or\n\n261\n00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:43.200\nI could slide this up a little bit.\n\n262\n00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.489\nSo now it doesn't matter.\n\n263\n00:13:45.489 --> 00:13:47.560\nYou see how it changed into an asterisk?\n\n264\n00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.300\nSo if you were trying block a specific\nversion of a program, maybe this new\n\n265\n00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.970\nversion that comes out is not compatible\nwith other software we're running.\n\n266\n00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:58.637\nSo we wanna prevent that or something like\nthat you can definitely do a file version.\n\n267\n00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:02.580\nIf I slide it up now it's notepad.exe,\ndoesn't matter what version.\n\n268\n00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:06.160\nIf I slide it up even further I can\nstart getting myself into trouble.\n\n269\n00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.970\nBecause I get into product name and\nI see Microsoft Windows operating system\n\n270\n00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.900\nand there's not much other\ninformation in there.\n\n271\n00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.136\nSo you can see I don't wanna\nblock everything from Microsoft.\n\n272\n00:14:18.136 --> 00:14:21.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You'd have the publisher again, yeah.\n\n273\n00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.243\nNow I'm gonna really start making\nthis system run poorly, if at all.\n\n274\n00:14:24.243 --> 00:14:27.839\n[LAUGH] So\nI'm gonna take that back down, and\n\n275\n00:14:27.839 --> 00:14:31.539\nwe'll just do it to file name notepad.exe.\n\n276\n00:14:31.539 --> 00:14:34.810\nAnd we'll go ahead and click Next, there's\nreally nothing else exciting to see here.\n\n277\n00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:36.690\nWe'll click Next.\n\n278\n00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.230\nOh, I'm sorry I lied to you,\n\n279\n00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.510\nI told you I was gonna take a look\nat some of those other options.\n\n280\n00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.790\nThe path option, pretty self-explanatory.\n\n281\n00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.340\nI'd go and I'd find that path.\n\n282\n00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:52.884\nThis would be\nC:/windows/system32/notepad.exe,\n\n283\n00:14:52.884 --> 00:14:55.327\nsomething like that.\n\n284\n00:14:55.327 --> 00:14:58.919\nNotice that I've got two options though,\nI've got Browse Files and Browse Folders.\n\n285\n00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.060\nIf I do a Browse File,\nI'll go find that executable and\n\n286\n00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.420\nit will list it here in this path.\n\n287\n00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.990\nIf I do Browse Folder, I'll go find the\nfolder that contains the executable and\n\n288\n00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.380\nthat would be listed there.\n\n289\n00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.320\nThe difference is if I do Browse Files,\nit lists the individual executable.\n\n290\n00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.870\nIf there were other executables in that\nfolder, they would still be able to run.\n\n291\n00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.300\nIf I do browse folders and\n\n292\n00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:26.150\nI pick the folder, all executables\nwithin that folder would be blocked.\n\n293\n00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:31.170\nSo sometimes applications have like two\ndifferent executables run to run under\n\n294\n00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.270\na different mode of something like that.\n\n295\n00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:37.387\nSo Browse Folders if the path contains\nmore than one executable that you're\n\n296\n00:15:37.387 --> 00:15:40.423\nwanting to block and\nyou wanna try to do it with one rule.\n\n297\n00:15:40.423 --> 00:15:44.440\nThe last option is the File hash, and\nwe could use this for Notepad as well.\n\n298\n00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.470\nWe would just go, find.\n\n299\n00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.640\nAgain, you've got browse files and\nfolders.\n\n300\n00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.461\nI could go browse, and find that guy.\n\n301\n00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:58.770\nAnd it will hash that, and\nmake a rule based on that hash value.\n\n302\n00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:04.320\nI say, we go back Ronnie and\ndo our Publisher option.\n\n303\n00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.190\nI can add exceptions.\n\n304\n00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:09.850\nIf I had drug that slider up a little bit\nhigher to where it was at the publisher\n\n305\n00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.890\nlevel maybe I wanna block\neverything from Adobe.\n\n306\n00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.780\nExcept for Adobe Reader,\nI could slide that up to Publisher,\n\n307\n00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.330\nwhich would be everything Adobe.\n\n308\n00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:22.830\nThen I could make an exception for\nAdobe Reader, or something like that.\n\n309\n00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.300\nI won't create any exceptions,\nI'll click next.\n\n310\n00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.960\nAnd there's the name of the rule.\n\n311\n00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.647\nI usually don't change these-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n312\n00:16:28.647 --> 00:16:29.813\n>> They're nice and\n\n313\n00:16:29.813 --> 00:16:31.760\ndescriptive although long.\n\n314\n00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.890\nAnd we'll click Create.\n\n315\n00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.040\nAnd now I have a new rule.\n\n316\n00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:41.630\nThat should block, oops I didn't\nmean to make it that big that quick,\n\n317\n00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:46.080\nthat should block notepad from running\non where ever I got this scope.\n\n318\n00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.970\nWhich in this case is the client\ncomputer's OU but, we're not done yet.\n\n319\n00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:55.250\nThere's other things that we've got\nto do before this rule will kick in.\n\n320\n00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.630\nI'm gonna back over here to AppLocker.\n\n321\n00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.860\nRight-click and choose Properties.\n\n322\n00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.700\nHere's the different classes or the ways\nthat I can enforce these AppLocker rules.\n\n323\n00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:09.230\nI've got my Executables,\nWindows installer, Scripts and Packages.\n\n324\n00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.745\nAnd notice each one has a check mark.\n\n325\n00:17:11.885 --> 00:17:13.205\nIf I don't change anything here,\n\n326\n00:17:13.205 --> 00:17:15.605\neven though I made that policy,\nit's not gonna do anything.\n\n327\n00:17:15.605 --> 00:17:17.825\nIt's not actually going to work,\nso what I need to do is say,\n\n328\n00:17:17.825 --> 00:17:20.835\nyou know what I have configured\nsome executable rules.\n\n329\n00:17:20.835 --> 00:17:22.945\nI want you to put those in place.\n\n330\n00:17:22.945 --> 00:17:25.815\nAnd then once I check that check mark,\nI've got a drop down list and\n\n331\n00:17:25.815 --> 00:17:28.880\nI've got Enforced rules and\nI've got Audit only.\n\n332\n00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.920\nEnforce rules means I'm gonna do what you\nsay, I'm gonna block notepad from running.\n\n333\n00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.150\nAudit says,\nI'm gonna allow notepad to run but\n\n334\n00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.470\nevery time somebody tries to run it,\nI'm gonna log it.\n\n335\n00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.520\nMaybe I don't want to block notepad,\n\n336\n00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.590\nI just wanna see how\nmany people are using it.\n\n337\n00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:50.000\nLet's say this was a software\nthat I need to buy licenses for.\n\n338\n00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.870\nI need to know how many I wanna buy.\n\n339\n00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.020\nI can audit how many people\nare running that program using this.\n\n340\n00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.530\nSo kinda cool that I can use this for\n\n341\n00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.990\nsomething other than\nblocking applications.\n\n342\n00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.570\nI can find out hey, how many people\nare actually using Notepad++?\n\n343\n00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.840\nLet's audit and\nsee how many people run it or\n\n344\n00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.140\njust to test your policy before\nyou actually go and enforce it.\n\n345\n00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:13.770\nSo Audit only will log that\nsomebody ran the application but\n\n346\n00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.630\nit won't prevent them from running it.\n\n347\n00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.470\nEnforce will apply my rules.\n\n348\n00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.930\nThere's also on the Advanced,\nyou can work with DLL files.\n\n349\n00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:25.800\nThis can really hamper your performance\nif it has to look at every DLL and\n\n350\n00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.039\ndecide whether it's allowed or not.\n\n351\n00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.440\nSo I'm gonna leave that on Configured,\nand click OK.\n\n352\n00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.530\nBut wait, there's more.\n\n353\n00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:34.911\nIf you call now.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n354\n00:18:34.911 --> 00:18:36.300\n>> We're not done.\n\n355\n00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:41.130\nWe created our default rules, then we\ncreated our rule that we want to block\n\n356\n00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:45.435\nNotepad, then we made sure that\nthat class of rules was enforced.\n\n357\n00:18:45.435 --> 00:18:48.640\nThere's one more thing.\n\n358\n00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.660\nThere's a service that\nthis process relies on.\n\n359\n00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.840\nIt's the application identity service, and\n\n360\n00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.640\nit needs to be running on\nthose client machines.\n\n361\n00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.090\nIt's what identifies the application,\nlooks at the rules and\n\n362\n00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:01.560\nsays, do I allow it or do I block it?\n\n363\n00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.810\nWell I need to make sure that that's\nrunning, and it's not running by default.\n\n364\n00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:08.120\nIf it's not running AppLocker won't work.\n\n365\n00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.690\nThat machine will still run that program\n\n366\n00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.490\nbecause it doesn't know\nanything about the program.\n\n367\n00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.870\nSo what we're gonna do is I'm\ngonna use the same policy,\n\n368\n00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:19.770\ngo up here to System Services, and\nthere's my Application Identity Service.\n\n369\n00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:25.070\nAnd I'm going to set that\nto Automatic then click OK.\n\n370\n00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:30.650\nSo again, to summarize all of that,\nI had to create my default rules.\n\n371\n00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:35.030\nThen I had to create the rule that I\nwanted to block Notepad in this case.\n\n372\n00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:36.900\nThen I had to go to\nthe properties of AppLocker and\n\n373\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:41.730\nmake sure I put that check mark in there\nand either turn it to Enforce or Audit.\n\n374\n00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.910\nThen I have to make sure that\nthat service is running.\n\n375\n00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:51.440\nWhen all of that is done, we'll close the\neditor, add that link to that clients OU.\n\n376\n00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.670\nSo the next thing then\nwould be to test it out.\n\n377\n00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:58.304\nNow that was a machine policy, so I am\njust going to restart this machine, and\n\n378\n00:19:58.304 --> 00:19:59.890\nwe'll see what happens.\n\n379\n00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.650\n>> [LAUGH] With all of these\ndifferent ways to be able to\n\n380\n00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:04.400\ncontrol the application.\n\n381\n00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.525\nWhat we're talking about now is that\ncentralized management inside a group\n\n382\n00:20:08.525 --> 00:20:12.780\npolicy to be able to say look, we're gonna\nuse AppLocker to help us to be able to\n\n383\n00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.950\nrestrict or to limit the actual\nway that the application.\n\n384\n00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:20.849\nAnd we're gonna prevent them from actually\nrunning it, in this instance here But\n\n385\n00:20:20.849 --> 00:20:24.683\nremember that all those little\nthings that Mike just showed us,\n\n386\n00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:29.380\nthe ability to block an entire publisher\nthat way, that's just amazing.\n\n387\n00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.388\nWe don't have to go and find executables,\nwe don't have to actually go and\n\n388\n00:20:32.388 --> 00:20:35.541\nfind hash values, we just say, look\nwith the metadatas that's involved with\n\n389\n00:20:35.541 --> 00:20:38.390\nthose applications,\nthey're all gonna list somebody's company.\n\n390\n00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.931\nAnd I wanna make sure that application or\n\n391\n00:20:40.931 --> 00:20:44.690\nthat type of software from that\npublisher is not gonna run.\n\n392\n00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:49.120\nThat makes it a lot better than what\nwe might have had at one point.\n\n393\n00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.140\nWe just had to create a hash value for\nevery single one or try and\n\n394\n00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.540\nlocate them all in one location\nwhen we installed them.\n\n395\n00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.660\nIt really is a neat way to be able to\nbe super flexible with that control.\n\n396\n00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:01.850\n>> Absolutely.\n\n397\n00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:03.340\nHow many different versions\nof iTunes are there?\n\n398\n00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:04.305\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n399\n00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:06.742\nif I want to block that I've\ngotta go find every version and\n\n400\n00:21:06.742 --> 00:21:08.050\ncreate that hash value for it?\n\n401\n00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.750\nHeck no, we can use this to block\nall versions of that program.\n\n402\n00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:12.290\n>> Right.\n\n403\n00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:15.090\n>> So\nnow what we'll do is we'll test this out.\n\n404\n00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.456\nDo I give them the warning ahead\nof time Ronnie or just wait and\n\n405\n00:21:18.456 --> 00:21:19.580\nsee if it runs here?\n\n406\n00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.270\nLet's see.\n\n407\n00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:21.710\nRun.\n\n408\n00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:22.940\nNotepad.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n409\n00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.690\n>> Enter, and there it goes.\n\n410\n00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.066\nWhat's the word, disclaimer I guess,\nis what I'm looking for.\n\n411\n00:21:30.066 --> 00:21:34.867\nI will tell you that I've worked with\nAppLocker policies for several years, and\n\n412\n00:21:34.867 --> 00:21:39.330\nthey're frustrating because they\ndon't kick in on the first try, ever.\n\n413\n00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:39.920\nI don't think I've ever-\n>> Yeah.\n\n414\n00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.670\n>> Seen it kick in on the first try.\n\n415\n00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:46.130\nWe'll run a GP update, we'll reboot\nthis machine a couple times, and\n\n416\n00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:48.550\neventually it will kick in.\n\n417\n00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.280\nIf I'm gonna try, let's just Restart\nit and try it one more time,\n\n418\n00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.970\nand then I'll show you a couple of trouble\nshooting methods that it would use, but\n\n419\n00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:58.380\nmore than likely it's just a time thing.\n\n420\n00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.280\nIt's gonna take a little bit\nbefore that policy kicks in,\n\n421\n00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.390\nI don't know what it is about it.\n\n422\n00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:05.030\nIt is slow right, but\nthe policies gonna be there.\n\n423\n00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:08.690\nI'm gonna show you where\nthe policies being applied.\n\n424\n00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:12.620\nIt's something to do with that\napplication identity service and\n\n425\n00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:16.885\nhow long it takes to get up and\nrunning and start scanning applications.\n\n426\n00:22:16.885 --> 00:22:17.730\ncuz what it's supposed to do,\n\n427\n00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:21.040\nis every time you launch\nan application that identity service,\n\n428\n00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.930\nthat application identity service looks\nat it, sees if it's on that list.\n\n429\n00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:27.674\nAnd for some reason it takes\nit's sweet time doing that.\n\n430\n00:22:27.674 --> 00:22:31.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we'll login as Rob again.\n\n431\n00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:34.370\nAnd we'll try it one more time.\n\n432\n00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.040\nKeep your fingers crossed.\n\n433\n00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:44.060\nWe'll go to Notepad, and\nsure enough there it goes.\n\n434\n00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.580\nSo troubleshooting this.\n\n435\n00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.080\nThe first thing I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna log off here and\n\n436\n00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.020\nsign back in as the local admin.\n\n437\n00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.160\nAs far as the group policy side goes,\n\n438\n00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.600\nI wanna make sure that that policy\nis linked to the proper OU.\n\n439\n00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.380\nIt's linked to the clients computer's OU\nwhich is where that client machine is so\n\n440\n00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.340\nwe're good to go there.\n\n441\n00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.870\nAs far as the setting goes, let's make\nsure I clicked Deny and not Allow.\n\n442\n00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:10.575\nThese are just some of the things\nthat you would wanna check.\n\n443\n00:23:10.575 --> 00:23:15.830\nSo let's see here,\nself restriction policies,\n\n444\n00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.560\nI didn't actually create any of those.\n\n445\n00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:20.750\nApplication Control Policies.\n\n446\n00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.140\nThere's my default rules.\n\n447\n00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.860\nHere's my Executables.\n\n448\n00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.221\nIn force is set to true, so\nI know I checked that little check mark,\n\n449\n00:23:26.221 --> 00:23:26.778\nthat's good.\n\n450\n00:23:26.778 --> 00:23:30.410\nDeny everyone, notepad.exe.\n\n451\n00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:36.640\nNo exceptions, so I know that I set\nup my policy correctly doing it.\n\n452\n00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.990\nSo we'll jump back up out here,\nwe'll flip back over to client.\n\n453\n00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:44.912\nThe next thing I would do is check and\n\n454\n00:23:44.912 --> 00:23:49.274\nsee if that policy is even, [INAUDIBLE]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n455\n00:23:49.274 --> 00:23:54.557\n>> Silly me, let me sign out.\n\n456\n00:23:54.557 --> 00:23:58.562\nAnd we'll Log in as the administrator,\nso we can do some troubleshooting.\n\n457\n00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.601\nSo I wanna do a GPresult, right?\n\n458\n00:24:04.601 --> 00:24:07.920\nSo make sure that the Group Policy\nis actually being applied.\n\n459\n00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.560\nSo I'll open up that command prompt.\n\n460\n00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:13.870\nDo a little gpresult r.\n\n461\n00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:20.580\nAnd we'll get this get play along.\n\n462\n00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:24.710\nI know the computer have,\nI see my software restriction.\n\n463\n00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:25.740\nIs that the one that I created?\n\n464\n00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:26.780\nLet's double check that.\n\n465\n00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.830\nYeah, software restriction.\n\n466\n00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:29.770\nSo that one is there.\n\n467\n00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.803\nSo, that's good.\nThe next thing I'm gonna wanna check would\n\n468\n00:24:32.803 --> 00:24:36.110\nbe to make sure that service\nis actually running.\n\n469\n00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.050\nWhoops.\n\n470\n00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:39.550\nThat's not how you spell it.\n\n471\n00:24:43.556 --> 00:24:46.083\nSo we'll go check on that\napplication identity, and\n\n472\n00:24:46.083 --> 00:24:48.563\nI can see that it is set to\nstartup type is automatic.\n\n473\n00:24:48.563 --> 00:24:51.410\nWhich was in that same policy, right.\n\n474\n00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.430\nSo you know that policy's being applied.\n\n475\n00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:56.183\nSee what I'm saying?\nSo as you're troubleshooting you can kinda\n\n476\n00:24:56.183 --> 00:24:59.750\nfigure that out, but we'll go ahead and\nclose that and that.\n\n477\n00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:05.290\nNow I can't test Notepad because I'm\nan administrator and we get a free pass.\n\n478\n00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:05.810\nSo I need to log off.\n\n479\n00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:09.480\nIn fact I'm just gonna go ahead and\nrestart this machine.\n\n480\n00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:15.240\nAll right, and we'll give it a minute and\nwe'll let that application identity\n\n481\n00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.549\nservice launch up, get started and\nmake sure it's running here.\n\n482\n00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.520\nAll right, so\nRonnie while we're waiting for that,\n\n483\n00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:26.410\nI guess the other thing I wanna talk\nabout is the mixed environments again.\n\n484\n00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:30.670\nOne of the things you have to be aware\nof is we can use both, all right?\n\n485\n00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:34.430\nIf I've got Windows 8 clients as\nwell as Windows XP clients, and\n\n486\n00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.575\nI wanna restrict software,\nI'm gonna need to use both.\n\n487\n00:25:37.575 --> 00:25:41.690\nAppLocker for those modern operating\nsystems, software restrictions for\n\n488\n00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:43.500\nthose older operating systems.\n\n489\n00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:49.410\nWhat we need to know is that you can't\nuse both of them in the same GPO.\n\n490\n00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:50.890\nWe can do them in the same domain.\n\n491\n00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:52.760\nWe can have two separate GPO's.\n\n492\n00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.849\nOne with the software restriction policy,\n\n493\n00:25:54.849 --> 00:25:57.590\none with the AppLocker policy\nlinked to the same OU.\n\n494\n00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:01.630\nBecause in that OU, I've got Windows XP\nclass as well as Windows 8 class.\n\n495\n00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:05.170\nI just can't put the settings\nin the same GPO, right?\n\n496\n00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:09.560\nif you put both Software Restrictions and\nAppLocker settings\n\n497\n00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.340\nin the same GPO then it's gonna ignore\nthe Software Restriction Policies and\n\n498\n00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:18.250\nonly apply the AppLocker policies which\nmeans your XP machines won't work,\n\n499\n00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.150\nthey will be able to run\nthe applications not gonna block them.\n\n500\n00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:24.680\nSo it's perfectly fine to use them both\nand you need to in a mixed environment.\n\n501\n00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.920\nJust don't put them in the same GPO.\n\n502\n00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.670\nSeparate GPOs for\nsoftware restriction versus Ad Blocker.\n\n503\n00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:31.640\nAll right so we'll see what happens.\n\n504\n00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.050\nWe'll log back in as Rob.\n\n505\n00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.440\nAnd once we get logged in,\n\n506\n00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:42.180\nwe'll keep our fingers crossed and\nwe'll try to run notepad.\n\n507\n00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:46.210\nSo we'll do a little Start Run,\nnotepad.exe.\n\n508\n00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:48.310\nAnd there we go.\n\n509\n00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:50.080\nThat is AppLocker kicking in.\n\n510\n00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.650\nYour system administrator\nhas blocked this program.\n\n511\n00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:55.830\nFor more information,\ncontact your system administrator.\n\n512\n00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:59.152\nNow one other thing I do\nwanna point out here, Ronnie,\n\n513\n00:26:59.152 --> 00:27:02.920\nif I go over to my Windows 8 Start\nscreen and I launch Notepad.\n\n514\n00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.759\nAll right.\n\n515\n00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:11.550\nNotice that it flips over to desktop,\nbut I don't get any message.\n\n516\n00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:12.220\nI don't like that.\n\n517\n00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.620\nI wish Microsoft would fix that.\n\n518\n00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.790\nIf you're listening Microsoft,\n[LAUGH] please fix that.\n\n519\n00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.040\nSomething gets lost in the transition\nfrom that new start screen\n\n520\n00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.360\nto the old school desktop.\n\n521\n00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.010\nThe message disappears.\n\n522\n00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:27.540\nIf I run it from the desktop,\nlike if I had a shortcut out here.\n\n523\n00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.350\nOr if I just type in notepad.\n\n524\n00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.870\nI see the message just fine.\n\n525\n00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:41.210\nIf I'm over on my start screen and I try\nto run Notepad it doesn't let it run.\n\n526\n00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:42.530\nBut I don't get that message.\n\n527\n00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:45.890\nSo the problem I have with that\nis my end user's gonna be saying\n\n528\n00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:47.440\nsomething's wrong with my machine.\n\n529\n00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.810\nThey don't see that message that\nthey think notepad is broken so\n\n530\n00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:53.030\nthey're gonna call the help desk,\nhey how come I can't launch Notepad.\n\n531\n00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:55.310\nYou're not supposed to be able\nto launch NotePad, right.\n\n532\n00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:58.860\nThey just don't get that message and\nthat kinda annoys me, but that is it.\n\n533\n00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.500\nThat's how we control those applications.\n\n534\n00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.730\n>> Yeah, now it seems like the key here is\npatience, right, more than anything else\n\n535\n00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.330\nis that we have to be patient with\nit actually being on a kick in.\n\n536\n00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:10.220\nSometimes thing may work right away,\n\n537\n00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.930\nbut on this one in particular it looks\nlike it takes a little bit of time.\n\n538\n00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:17.040\nSo several reboots and\nthen we're actually ready to go.\n\n539\n00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:22.610\nSo don't, we shouldn't say that you can\nexpect it to work immediately [LAUGH] but\n\n540\n00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:27.380\nour experience is that\nit takes a bit of time.\n\n541\n00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.640\n>> Yeah.\nI think sometimes,\n\n542\n00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.380\nI know I get a little big impatient,\nbecause I went and\n\n543\n00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.870\ncreated the policy,\nI wanna test it right now.\n\n544\n00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:38.060\nAnd the reality is, I'll be creating\nthis policy, deploying it out across my\n\n545\n00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:43.610\nenterprise and by tomorrow it's gonna be\neffectively blocking that application.\n\n546\n00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:46.530\nOnce they log on in the morning,\nlog off, go to lunch,\n\n547\n00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:51.560\nlog back in, refresh policy a couple\ntimes, normally through the refresh cycle,\n\n548\n00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:56.910\nit's gonna kick in, it's gonna block note\npad, it just might not do it immediately.\n\n549\n00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:59.690\nAnd usually we're okay with that, right.\n\n550\n00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:02.750\nThe only other thing you could do is\nlike force reboot on all your systems,\n\n551\n00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.820\ntry to speed that process up.\n\n552\n00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:05.730\n>> Excellent.\n\n553\n00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:09.340\nSo in this episode right we took a look\nat a couple different ways that we can\n\n554\n00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:13.490\ncontrol the way that applications are\ngonna appear on our end users computer, or\n\n555\n00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:15.000\nactually not even be able to run.\n\n556\n00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.980\nSo we can actually control it using\nthe software restriction policies\n\n557\n00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.040\nas well as that application control\npolicy that we call AppLocker.\n\n558\n00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:24.540\nIf you're actually in a mixed environment,\nyou may actually need to use both so\n\n559\n00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:28.670\ndo remember that little piece of knowledge\nor you're gonna be very frustrated.\n\n560\n00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:32.730\nWhen now all of a sudden one\nruns on XP but is not running on\n\n561\n00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:37.550\nyour newer machines as well, so you do\nneed to make sure that you are using both.\n\n562\n00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:41.280\nAlso, remember the idea of\npatience is the key here.\n\n563\n00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.170\nBeing able to do that is also gonna\ntake a little bit of time and\n\n564\n00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:47.760\ntrial and whatever works for your\nenvironment, that's what you'll also have.\n\n565\n00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:51.550\nBut with what we talked about in\nthe AppLocker, amazing flexibility too.\n\n566\n00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.780\nMike, did you have something?\n\n567\n00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.590\n>> Yeah, the one last thing I\nwanna leave you guys with is,\n\n568\n00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:56.170\nwe could go the other route, right?\n\n569\n00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:58.310\nWe talk about blocking applications.\n\n570\n00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:02.600\nIf I've got a kiosk machine that I really\nwanna lock down, I can go the other way.\n\n571\n00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:07.460\nI can block everything and then just\nmake rules to choose what I wanna allow.\n\n572\n00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:11.510\nRight, instead of allowing everything and\nthen trying to block certain applications,\n\n573\n00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:12.970\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n574\n00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:18.120\n>> Oh yeah there's another context that\nwe might also use a application locker\n\n575\n00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.030\nto help us out as well.\n\n576\n00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.685\nAll right.\nSo that's a great place for\n\n577\n00:30:21.685 --> 00:30:24.385\nus to go ahead and end this episode, then.\n\n578\n00:30:24.385 --> 00:30:26.925\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n579\n00:30:26.925 --> 00:30:27.575\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n580\n00:30:27.575 --> 00:30:29.660\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n581\n00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:33.750\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.494\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:20.690\ntoday we're gonna be taking a look\nat working with group policy.\n\n5\n00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.690\nWe're specifically gonna be diving in\nto using Group Policy Preferences and\n\n6\n00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.380\nthat's what we actually wanna focus in on.\n\n7\n00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.500\nMike, the very fact is, and here's Mr.\nMike Rogers of course.\n\n8\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.480\nMike, the very fact is, I have policies\nand I understand what those policies are.\n\n9\n00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.910\nI also start to see inside of\nthe Group Policy Management Console,\n\n10\n00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.390\nI have preferences.\n\n11\n00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.020\nBut why would I choose to ever use\npreferences if I have policies?\n\n12\n00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.810\n>> Couple of reasons, Ronnie, great\nquestion and first of all they're new and\n\n13\n00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.000\nexciting so we want to use them.\n\n14\n00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.901\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n15\n00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:49.307\n[LAUGH]\n>> I kid, I tease,\n\n16\n00:00:49.307 --> 00:00:52.859\nno but group policy preferences\ncame about because there\n\n17\n00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.500\nwere certain limitations\nto group policy settings.\n\n18\n00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.800\nThere were some things that we just\ncouldn't do with a normal GPO.\n\n19\n00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.410\nBefore we had these preferences.\n\n20\n00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.840\nThe big ones that I remember working with,\nRonnie, were mapping network drives.\n\n21\n00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.730\nThere was no easy way to map\na network drive with a GPO so\n\n22\n00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.180\nwhat we would do as admins\nif we would create scripts.\n\n23\n00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.850\nEther startup scripts or log on scripts so\nevery time that user would log on\n\n24\n00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.310\nthese scripts would execute and\nit would map drives in the background.\n\n25\n00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.950\nWhich worked fine but that does put\na little bit of a delay on that log on or\n\n26\n00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.370\nlike if it can't reach out and\nfind that drive,\n\n27\n00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.170\nit could have issues about\nexecuting that script.\n\n28\n00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.760\nSo it's a little bit cumbersome there.\n\n29\n00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.100\nPrinters were another one.\n\n30\n00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.140\nThere was no real easy way\nto deploy printers out\n\n31\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.070\nto my end users via a group policy until\n\n32\n00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.890\nI wanna say 2008 when they started\nadding some GPO settings to do that.\n\n33\n00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.570\nSo preferences were actually\ndeveloped outside of Microsoft.\n\n34\n00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.690\nIt was another organization and I should\nknow this guy's or this company's name and\n\n35\n00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.870\nI can't remember but they developed\nthese preferences as an add on.\n\n36\n00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.980\nMicrosoft liked them so\nmuch that they incorporated them in.\n\n37\n00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.850\nThey said let's make those\na standard part of this GPU.\n\n38\n00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.430\nThe group policy management console and\ngroup policies themselves and\n\n39\n00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.830\nso we get those now in a GPO.\n\n40\n00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.670\nSo we got those preferences as\nwell as our normal settings.\n\n41\n00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.500\nThe other cool thing about preferences\nis the filtering capabilities.\n\n42\n00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.730\nWhat they call item level targeting.\n\n43\n00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.360\nAnd it's fantastic.\n\n44\n00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.290\nWe've learned in here how to\ndo security filtering, right?\n\n45\n00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.940\nWe can go to that scope tab of GPO.\n\n46\n00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.670\nI can remove the authenticated users\ngroup and add in a different group.\n\n47\n00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.130\nSo that it only applies to people that\nare in that group or I can go to that\n\n48\n00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.810\ndelegation tab and click advance and open\nup the access control list for a GPO and\n\n49\n00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.780\nI can filter policies there\nbased on permissions with you,\n\n50\n00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.070\nif I deny you the permission to\napply your policy for example.\n\n51\n00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.290\nThen it won't apply to you even\nif it's scoped to know you\n\n52\n00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.960\nthat you're user account or\ncomputer account is in.\n\n53\n00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.270\nSo we've had that but with preferences and\nitem level targeting it is easy.\n\n54\n00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.290\nWe talked about w mod filters and\n\n55\n00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.990\nremember I said that's a whole other\nlanguage that you've gotta learn\n\n56\n00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.390\nthat WQL that windows query language\nyou've gotta understand all those classes.\n\n57\n00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.360\nI can do some really neat things with that\nI can look at operating system version,\n\n58\n00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.970\nservice pack levels,\namount of RAM, things like that.\n\n59\n00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.180\nBut I've gotta be able to write this\nquery, and I've gotta understand all those\n\n60\n00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.430\nclasses that go along with Windows\nmanagement instrumentation.\n\n61\n00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.315\nWith group policy preferences,\nthey're gonna be drop-down lists.\n\n62\n00:03:27.315 --> 00:03:30.515\nIt's very, very easy to work with.\n\n63\n00:03:30.515 --> 00:03:34.475\nSo that's really why we get them is\nbecause it extends the functionality\n\n64\n00:03:34.475 --> 00:03:35.935\nof group policy objects.\n\n65\n00:03:35.935 --> 00:03:36.815\nThat's the main thing.\n\n66\n00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:39.805\nAnd then that item-level\ntargeting is fantastic.\n\n67\n00:03:39.805 --> 00:03:43.305\n>> Now, Mike, with the policies we\nunderstand a lot of times that,\n\n68\n00:03:43.305 --> 00:03:48.700\nwhen we implement those, usually the end\nuser might also get a message that\n\n69\n00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.810\nsome of their settings are actually\ncontrolled by the administrator.\n\n70\n00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.220\nIs that going to be the same with\nthe group policy preferences?\n\n71\n00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.920\nOr is there any differences?\n\n72\n00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.780\n>> That's a great question\nthere is a difference.\n\n73\n00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.360\nGroup policy preferences do\nnot lock the user interface.\n\n74\n00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.400\nGroup policy settings,\n\n75\n00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.310\nthe ones we've been working with up to\nthis point, lock that user interface.\n\n76\n00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.290\nSo if I set their screen saver timeout to\nten minutes, it's gonna be great out, and\n\n77\n00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.400\nthe user interface, they can't change it.\n\n78\n00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.780\nWith group policy preferences,\nit doesn't lock the user interface, so\n\n79\n00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.390\nthey can undo anything that I apply,\nusing a group policy preference.\n\n80\n00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.870\nSo that's the first big difference is\nit doesn't lock the user interface.\n\n81\n00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.070\nThe other big difference is the fact\nthat with group policy settings\n\n82\n00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.700\nit locks the user interface,\nbut if I remove the policy or\n\n83\n00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.870\nif I move your account out of the OU\nthat the policy is scoped to,\n\n84\n00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.460\nthe setting no longer applies to you and\nthe interface will be unlocked.\n\n85\n00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.660\nAnd so if I had that screensaver timeout\nlinked to the GNV OU, Your settings\n\n86\n00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.910\nwould be locked and you'd be stuck with\nthat ten minute screen saver timeout.\n\n87\n00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.060\nIf I move your account into a different OU\nand the policies no longer scope to that,\n\n88\n00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.115\nall of a sudden you would be able to\nchange your screen saver timeout.\n\n89\n00:04:58.115 --> 00:05:00.510\nThe lock would be released.\n\n90\n00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.170\nWith preferences it doesn't\nlock the user interface but\n\n91\n00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.440\nit tattoos the registry; meaning that once\nthe setting is there you're gonna have\n\n92\n00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.260\nto manually undo it, which you're free to\ndo because it doesn't lock the interface.\n\n93\n00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.090\nBut even if I delete the policy or\nif I move your account out of the OU that\n\n94\n00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.470\nthe policy is scoped to,\nthe setting will still be there.\n\n95\n00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.890\nThat's what they mean by\ntattooing the registry.\n\n96\n00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.150\nIt's not automatically undone once\nthat policy falls out of scope.\n\n97\n00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.250\nSo you would have to go back in and\n\n98\n00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.730\nmanually change that setting\nif you no longer wanted it.\n\n99\n00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.740\nSo a couple of key differences there,\nthere are also some similarities.\n\n100\n00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.220\nThere's preferences\nunder the computer half\n\n101\n00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.340\nas well as preferences\nunder the user half.\n\n102\n00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.310\nThere is quite a bit of overlap but\nthere are some settings that are unique to\n\n103\n00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.960\nthe computer half or\nunique to the user half.\n\n104\n00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.290\nThey apply at the same time, so computer\nsettings apply when the computer log,\n\n105\n00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.690\nor the computer starts up\nas well as preferences,\n\n106\n00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.810\ncomputer based preferences apply\nwhen the computer starts up.\n\n107\n00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.040\nUser based preferences apply when the user\nlogs on, they're gonna refresh at the same\n\n108\n00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.800\ninterval 90 to 120 minutes, so when it\nrefreshes group policy, it's refreshing\n\n109\n00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.560\nboth preferences and settings, so\nthey refresh at the same interval as well.\n\n110\n00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.410\nSo in that respect,\nthey're similar, right?\n\n111\n00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.440\nAnd they're in the same GPO or\nthe same Group Policy Object, so\n\n112\n00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.160\nwe scope in the same way, we link it to an\nOU, outward to the domain or to the site.\n\n113\n00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.150\nSo in that respect, they're the same.\n\n114\n00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.370\nNow but there's some really cool\nthings we can do, so let's dive in and\n\n115\n00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.820\ntake a look at these guys.\n\n116\n00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.800\nI'm gonna open up my\nGroup Policy Management console and\n\n117\n00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.210\nI'm just gonna go over\nhere to the employee's OU.\n\n118\n00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.480\nAnd let me kill that little dialog there.\n\n119\n00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.775\nAnd I'll create a new GPO.\n\n120\n00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.570\nI'm gonna call it preferences.\n\n121\n00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.660\nJust because we're gonna be\ntesting some preferences here.\n\n122\n00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.050\nAnd I'm gonna right click on that GPO\nthat I just created, and choose edit.\n\n123\n00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.250\nAnd we'll expand that out, and\nwe'll take a look at what we've got.\n\n124\n00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.240\nSo again, under the computer half, I've\ngot Preferences, and then I've got some\n\n125\n00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.360\nWindows settings as well as some\nControl Panel settings, right?\n\n126\n00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.480\nAnd you can see things like under\nthe computer I get Environment variables,\n\n127\n00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:16.350\nwe can Files, and create files or\nfolders, we can create INI files.\n\n128\n00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.237\nWe can do Registry keys,\nwe got Network Shares and\n\n129\n00:07:19.237 --> 00:07:22.279\nShortcuts, and\nthere's Control Panel settings.\n\n130\n00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:26.842\nWe've got Data Sources like ODBCs or\nDatabase Connectivity,\n\n131\n00:07:26.842 --> 00:07:32.094\nDevices, Folder Options, Local Users and\nGroups, Network Options,\n\n132\n00:07:32.094 --> 00:07:37.570\nPower Options, Printers,\nScheduled Tasks and services, right.\n\n133\n00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:38.570\nIf we collapse that up and\n\n134\n00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:43.450\nwe're gonna take a look at the User\nhalf you'll see it's very similar.\n\n135\n00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:47.924\nI get applications instead of\nenvironment variables which actually I\n\n136\n00:07:47.924 --> 00:07:49.296\nhaven't found any.\n\n137\n00:07:49.296 --> 00:07:54.217\nFor applications you need a plug in and\nMicrosoft assumed that somebody would\n\n138\n00:07:54.217 --> 00:07:58.606\ncreate some as this became more\npopular I haven't found any yet, but\n\n139\n00:07:58.606 --> 00:08:00.587\nthere's Drive Maps, right?\n\n140\n00:08:00.587 --> 00:08:03.348\nI still have my environment variables,\nfiles and\n\n141\n00:08:03.348 --> 00:08:05.770\nfolders, Ini files and the list goes on.\n\n142\n00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.990\nAnd then you can see pretty much the same\nlist for Control Panel settings as well.\n\n143\n00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.960\nSo same concept, right?\n\n144\n00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.010\nIf I apply one of these preferences to\nthe computer using the computer half.\n\n145\n00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:19.130\nAll users that log onto that\nmachine would see that preference.\n\n146\n00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:22.480\nIf I do it under the user half,\nthan it's gonna follow that user around.\n\n147\n00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.250\nWhatever machine they log onto,\n\n148\n00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.650\nthat preference is going to\nfollow them around, right?\n\n149\n00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.740\nSo let's dive in here, we're gonna\ncreate a couple of preferences, so\n\n150\n00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.710\nwe can see one, how to create them.\n\n151\n00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.630\nCuz it's a little bit different\nfrom my Group Policy settings.\n\n152\n00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:41.680\nAnd I also want to show you that item\nlevel targeting that we can do as well.\n\n153\n00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.850\nSo let's start with a simple one and\nyou know what, Ronnie,\n\n154\n00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:48.200\nI just realized I don't\nhave a share to map.\n\n155\n00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.280\nSo let's go create one.\n\n156\n00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.440\nI'm gonna come in here, create a new\nfolder and we'll call it Data.\n\n157\n00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.749\nAnd we'll share this guy out.\n\n158\n00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:04.510\nReal quick and I'm gonna follow,\nor not follow my best practices.\n\n159\n00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.670\nAnd just for this demo,\nwe'll give everyone at least, well,\n\n160\n00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.500\nwe'll do a read and\nwrite and we'll click Share.\n\n161\n00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.420\nJust something that we'll have\nto play around with, all right.\n\n162\n00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:18.420\nSo if I want my users, let's say I've\ntold them I want them to store all\n\n163\n00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.320\nreports up here in this folder\non this file server, all right.\n\n164\n00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.680\nBut I don't want him to have\nto remember it's //dc01/data,\n\n165\n00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:30.830\nI want it to show up as a drive\nletter in Windows Explorer.\n\n166\n00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.440\nOr we can map a drive.\n\n167\n00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.120\nI can right click on this guy and\nchoose New Mapped Drive.\n\n168\n00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.580\nOpens up this dialogue box.\n\n169\n00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.030\nAnd this dialogue is gonna be similar for\nall of these over here.\n\n170\n00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.770\nThere's a couple that\nare slightly different, but\n\n171\n00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.620\nmost of them work the same way.\n\n172\n00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.686\nAt the very top I get an action and\nI've got four actions that I can do,\n\n173\n00:09:49.686 --> 00:09:52.083\nCreate, Replace, Update and Delete.\n\n174\n00:09:52.083 --> 00:09:54.267\nNow it is important that\nyou pick the right one,\n\n175\n00:09:54.267 --> 00:09:56.020\nthey're self explanatory, right?\n\n176\n00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.850\nI mean create is making something new.\n\n177\n00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:03.500\nReplace means something needs to exist\nalready and I'm gonna get rid of it and\n\n178\n00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.800\nput something else in its place, right?\n\n179\n00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.530\nUpdate would change an existing object,\n\n180\n00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.040\nmake changes to something\nthat already exists.\n\n181\n00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.110\nDelete would remove something.\n\n182\n00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.610\nAnd the reason I say you have\nto be kind of careful with this,\n\n183\n00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.960\nif I choose Replace and I go to\nMap This Drive, well, what am I replacing?\n\n184\n00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.642\nThey don't have a map drive to replace,\nright?\n\n185\n00:10:23.642 --> 00:10:26.355\nSo this setting is gonna\nhave an issue with that.\n\n186\n00:10:26.355 --> 00:10:28.810\nYou have to think about what\nis it that you're doing.\n\n187\n00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.640\nWell, I'm trying to create\nsomething that doesn't exist.\n\n188\n00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.710\nThe Replace, a lot of times is used for\nfiles and folders, but\n\n189\n00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.020\nit could be used for shortcuts or\nany number of things.\n\n190\n00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:45.410\nSo Create, where do I wanna create this or\nwhere am I gonna map this to?\n\n191\n00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:46.930\nWell, I could browse but\n\n192\n00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:51.820\nremember you wanna be careful, you wanna\nmake sure you're using a UNC path here.\n\n193\n00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:57.800\nSo I typically find it easier\njust to type it out, dc01/data.\n\n194\n00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:03.018\nAnd then I could label that as,\nmaybe I do reports or something like that.\n\n195\n00:11:03.018 --> 00:11:03.570\nYou can do reconnect.\n\n196\n00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.915\nDo you want this to be persistent?\n\n197\n00:11:06.915 --> 00:11:11.100\nEverytime they log on,\nI want this map drive to be there, I\n\n198\n00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:16.110\ngot my drive letter and I love this option\nbecause you can use a particular letter.\n\n199\n00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.250\nBut we all know that as\nI plug thumb drives and\n\n200\n00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.710\nthings like that into my computer,\nthose letters start getting used up.\n\n201\n00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.550\nSo what if a user has one of\nthose 12 in 1 card readers and\n\n202\n00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.874\na couple thumb drives plugged in.\n\n203\n00:11:28.874 --> 00:11:33.610\nG might already be taken, and so\nwhat's gonna happen is this will fail.\n\n204\n00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:37.411\nIt will attempt to map the drive, but it\nwon't be able to assign the drive letter\n\n205\n00:11:37.411 --> 00:11:39.641\ncuz it's already in use\non that one computer.\n\n206\n00:11:39.641 --> 00:11:44.050\nSo you can do is you can say,\nuse the first available starting at G.\n\n207\n00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.788\nSo try to use G, but\nif that's unavailable, then go to H.\n\n208\n00:11:46.788 --> 00:11:51.320\nAnd then onto I, until it finds the first\ndrive letter that's available, right?\n\n209\n00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.770\nSo I love that option there.\n\n210\n00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:57.320\nIf you needed to supply additional\ncredentials, you can do that.\n\n211\n00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.510\nAnd so\nthat's basically the mapped drive there.\n\n212\n00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.630\nAnd we'll go ahead and click OK on this,\n\n213\n00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.380\nwe're gonna get into the item\nlevel targeting in just a second.\n\n214\n00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.768\nLet's save that for another one.\n\n215\n00:12:07.768 --> 00:12:13.902\nWe'll click OK and now I've got my\nnew preference set up in the G view.\n\n216\n00:12:13.902 --> 00:12:19.830\nAnd if we wanna see if it works, we could\nflip back over to my client machine,\n\n217\n00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.810\nI did that as a user setting.\n\n218\n00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.510\nI'm pretty sure I did, Ronnie, right?\n\n219\n00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.120\nI'll log on as rob and\nlet's just verify that.\n\n220\n00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.110\nWe'll double check our settings here and\nyeah,\n\n221\n00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.900\nthat was done under my user half,\nso we're good to go there.\n\n222\n00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.310\nSo we'll flip over to the desktop,\nwe'll open up File Explorer.\n\n223\n00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:46.950\nI say we will make sure Windows wants\nto play along and look at there.\n\n224\n00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.653\nThere's my Reports folder,\nthat I can now connect to and\n\n225\n00:12:49.653 --> 00:12:51.800\nsince I gave them write permission.\n\n226\n00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.020\nThey should be able to upload documents or\nwhatever they need to do.\n\n227\n00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.629\nSo you can see in the end,\n\n228\n00:12:57.629 --> 00:13:02.240\nI mean it really works just like\na normal group policy setting, right?\n\n229\n00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.510\nYou go into the GPO,\nyou drill down to what it is you want,\n\n230\n00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:06.940\nyou walk through that little.\n\n231\n00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.750\nIt's wizard-driven though,\ninstead of having it enabled,\n\n232\n00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.180\ndisabled or not configured.\n\n233\n00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.542\nAll right, Ronnie, you wanna do some more?\n\n234\n00:13:13.542 --> 00:13:14.970\n>> Let's do some more.\n\n235\n00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.020\n>> All right, we'll flip back over here\nand I'm just gonna use that same policy.\n\n236\n00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:23.210\nWe'll click Edit and I'll maximize\nthis guy, so we can see everything and\n\n237\n00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.430\nwe'll get underneath Preferences and\nWindows settings.\n\n238\n00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:31.120\nSo we mapped a drive, another cool\none to do might be files or folders.\n\n239\n00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:37.450\nSay I want everybody to,\ntrying to think of a good example, right?\n\n240\n00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:41.310\nI want to create a folder on\neverybody's hard drive to store,\n\n241\n00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:42.240\nI don't know reports in.\n\n242\n00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.080\nI'm not creative enough to\ncome up with something else.\n\n243\n00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.870\nSo I can go to Folders,\nright-click, New > Folder.\n\n244\n00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.700\nI can choose to create a new folder.\n\n245\n00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.095\nWhere do I want to make it?\n\n246\n00:13:53.095 --> 00:13:58.449\nSQL/ and we'll call it Stuff.\n\n247\n00:13:58.449 --> 00:13:59.386\n>> Stuff?\n\n248\n00:13:59.386 --> 00:14:00.810\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n249\n00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:02.930\n>> Oops, if I could spell.\n\n250\n00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.580\nAnd that should be good enough,\nwe can click OK, so\n\n251\n00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.875\nthat should create a new folder\non their drive called Stuff.\n\n252\n00:14:08.875 --> 00:14:12.237\n[LAUGH] We can do shortcuts, right?\n\n253\n00:14:12.237 --> 00:14:14.749\nRight-click > New > Shortcut and\n\n254\n00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:18.860\nlet's create one on their desktop and\nI really like this.\n\n255\n00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:19.590\nWatch this.\n\n256\n00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.070\nAction Create, Name,\nI'm gonna call it Notepad.\n\n257\n00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.950\nThe Target type is a File System Object.\n\n258\n00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.200\nLocation, where do I wanna\ncreate this shortcut?\n\n259\n00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.140\nYou might think oh gosh, now I've gotta\ndo C:/users/, where do I put that?\n\n260\n00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:34.970\nOh, no.\n\n261\n00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:39.622\nJust hit your drop-down list and say eh,\nI wanna put it on their desktop, right?\n\n262\n00:14:39.622 --> 00:14:41.253\nHow easy is that?\n\n263\n00:14:41.253 --> 00:14:48.230\nTarget pass C:/windows/ oops,\n\n264\n00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:54.747\n/system32/notepad.exe.\n\n265\n00:14:54.747 --> 00:14:55.650\n>> It's amazing.\n\n266\n00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:56.416\n>> All right [LAUGH].\n\n267\n00:14:56.416 --> 00:15:00.358\nBut I don't think we really need anything\nelse, I can create shortcut keys for them,\n\n268\n00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:01.410\nsomething like that.\n\n269\n00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.940\nWe click OK.\n\n270\n00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.060\nSo there's a new shortcut, right?\n\n271\n00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:11.928\nIf we go down into Control Panel, we've\ngot other things like Folder Options.\n\n272\n00:15:11.928 --> 00:15:14.585\nMaybe I wanna configure\na new Folder option.\n\n273\n00:15:14.585 --> 00:15:18.970\nNotice this one gives me Folder Options\nfor Windows XP or Folder Options for\n\n274\n00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.338\nAt least Window Vista, right?\n\n275\n00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:26.587\nInternet Settings, I can come in here and\ncreate New Internet settings.\n\n276\n00:15:26.587 --> 00:15:29.667\nAnd notice it has got different\nnodes here or different options for\n\n277\n00:15:29.667 --> 00:15:32.690\nthe different versions\nof Internet Explorer.\n\n278\n00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.210\nIf we wanna add somebody\ninto Local users and Groups,\n\n279\n00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:39.450\nConfigure a Power Option,\nSet up a scheduled task.\n\n280\n00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.140\nI mean,\nit really they're all about the same.\n\n281\n00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.900\nIt's just what is it that you want to do?\n\n282\n00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.317\n>> Mike, when I've actually\nworked with a more than anything,\n\n283\n00:15:47.317 --> 00:15:48.672\nit's been this idea the printer.\n\n284\n00:15:48.672 --> 00:15:52.175\nThe very fact is, that we had\na couple different printers and\n\n285\n00:15:52.175 --> 00:15:54.587\nwe didn't want to set one up as a default.\n\n286\n00:15:54.587 --> 00:15:56.259\nBut the reason why we all said that is so\n\n287\n00:15:56.259 --> 00:15:59.540\nthat we can give them the option to\nchoose a different printer as well.\n\n288\n00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.890\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n289\n00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.190\nI've done the same thing, Ronnie.\n\n290\n00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:06.680\nYou can come in here, and you can choose\nNew > printer, like a shared or TCP, or\n\n291\n00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.560\nlocal printer.\n\n292\n00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.850\nAnd it will just walk you\nthrough the same thing.\n\n293\n00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:10.856\nYou're choosing to add it.\n\n294\n00:16:10.856 --> 00:16:14.630\nAll right, to create,\nI could put that path in there.\n\n295\n00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.980\nAnd I love this option here,\nlike let's pretend.\n\n296\n00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.380\nI don't actually have a printer,\nbut let's say I print one,\n\n297\n00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:24.570\nlet's say I've got a Canon out there or\nsomething like that, share it out.\n\n298\n00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:26.840\nYou can say set this as\nthe default printer, but\n\n299\n00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.660\nyou can also choose only if\na local printer is not present.\n\n300\n00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:35.590\nThat's really cool, because we can set\nthat printer as the default, push it out.\n\n301\n00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.840\nBut what if I've got a couple users that\nhave their own printer on their desk?\n\n302\n00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.260\nAnd now all of a sudden it's no\nlonger their default printer.\n\n303\n00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.880\nAnd they're like, what the heck happened?\n\n304\n00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.130\nSo I can say set it as the default.\n\n305\n00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.730\nBut if they've got a local\nprinter attached to the computer,\n\n306\n00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.010\ndon't change their default, all right?\n\n307\n00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:54.520\nSo that's a beautiful option there,\nlet's see what else?\n\n308\n00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:59.300\nYou know power options, you can configure\nsome power settings through group policy\n\n309\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.190\nsettings, but\nif I do that they can't change it, right?\n\n310\n00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.730\nIf I use a power option through\na preference they can change it.\n\n311\n00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:09.750\nI want everybody's screen saver\nto kick in in 15 minutes.\n\n312\n00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.170\nBut what about my hosts?\n\n313\n00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.450\nI don't need them in the middle of\na show having that screen saver kick in.\n\n314\n00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:17.377\nSo if they choose to do so,\nthey can change their power options,\n\n315\n00:17:17.377 --> 00:17:19.779\ncuz this doesn't lock the user interface,\nright?\n\n316\n00:17:19.779 --> 00:17:23.100\nSo it's a really a pretty cool thing.\n\n317\n00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:28.760\nThe next thing I want to show you is\ngoing to be that item level targeting.\n\n318\n00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.580\nSo let's think of one that we can do.\n\n319\n00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.760\nYou know what let's go and\nmodify that notepad shortcut real quick.\n\n320\n00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:41.170\nSo I'm going to,\nwhere is this link, to that OU,\n\n321\n00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.290\nwe'll go back into that notepad\none that we already created\n\n322\n00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:48.300\nwhere I'm creating that new shortcut and\nI'm gonna do some item level targeting.\n\n323\n00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.450\nThat's done on this\ncommon tab over here and\n\n324\n00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.070\nyou've got a few other\noptions like stop processing.\n\n325\n00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:58.300\nIf an error occurs remove this\nitem when its no longer applied,\n\n326\n00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.510\nwhich tries to un-tatoo.\n\n327\n00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:04.930\nLike I said it tattoos the registry,\nso usually it doesn't work.\n\n328\n00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.860\nApply once do not reapply.\n\n329\n00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:11.110\nThe main one here is the item level\ntarget; and I'm going to click targeting.\n\n330\n00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:13.740\nAnd let's say I only want this,\nwell, actually,\n\n331\n00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.270\nlet's just go through all\nthe different options.\n\n332\n00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.780\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n333\n00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.540\n>> When I go to new item,\nlook at the list that I get.\n\n334\n00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.930\nBattery present, that's a great one.\n\n335\n00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:23.470\nNow I can tell the difference\nbetween a laptop and\n\n336\n00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:28.280\na desktop without writing some\ncrazy WMI query to figure that out.\n\n337\n00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.870\nComputer name, CPU speed, disk space,\nI mean, that's a great one.\n\n338\n00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:37.000\nYou know if I'm trying to install Office,\nI need so much disk space available\n\n339\n00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.520\nif I wanna not process this,\nbecause they don't have enough disk space.\n\n340\n00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:48.630\nIP address range,\nyou can still do it an MSI Query,\n\n341\n00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.690\nyou can base it on operating system.\n\n342\n00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.180\nLet's say I only want this shortcut\nto appear on their desktop\n\n343\n00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.321\nif they're running Windows 8.1 or later.\n\n344\n00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:01.800\nWell I can choose, operating system,\nproduct is Windows 8.\n\n345\n00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.650\nLook at that drop down list, it knows\nall the different operating systems.\n\n346\n00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:09.100\nEdition any, or\nI could get very specific if I wanted to.\n\n347\n00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:14.430\nRelease any, computer role for\na desktop really doesn't do a whole lot.\n\n348\n00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:16.870\nSo I have nothing to change there.\n\n349\n00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.000\nBut if it was a server I could say,\nif it was running DHCP,\n\n350\n00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.840\nI want you to apply this.\n\n351\n00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.970\nSo will just leave that as eight.\n\n352\n00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:29.770\nAlthough is that going to include,\nthat should include 8.1 as well right,\n\n353\n00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:33.340\nbecause I'm doing any addition,\nany release.\n\n354\n00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.230\nAnother cool thing you can do with these\nis you can add multiple conditions.\n\n355\n00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:42.660\nSo I can say the operating system is\nWindows 8.1 and what else could we do?\n\n356\n00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:47.890\nThe organizational unit is.\n\n357\n00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.560\nBelongs to or is one of the following\ndescendants and I can go in and\n\n358\n00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.113\nI can browse.\n\n359\n00:19:51.113 --> 00:19:56.741\nAnd I can come in and I can say only\nif it's in that G & V OU, all right?\n\n360\n00:19:56.741 --> 00:19:57.710\nSo we can add that.\n\n361\n00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.770\nNow these are going to be written as AND\nstatements by default, so\n\n362\n00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.380\nboth conditions would have to be true.\n\n363\n00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:08.900\nIf I want to change that up I can\nselect it and change that to a an oar.\n\n364\n00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.170\nOr an is, or is not, all right.\n\n365\n00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.550\nIf they're not in this particular group,\n\n366\n00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.820\nyou see all the different items that\nwe have here that we can work with.\n\n367\n00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.740\nHow much RAM the machine has.\n\n368\n00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.440\nWhat security group they belong to.\n\n369\n00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.810\nThere's my WMI word query down there.\n\n370\n00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:28.610\nSo you can get really creative\nwith these filters and\n\n371\n00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:30.730\nnotice its all drop down lists.\n\n372\n00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.550\nRight I mean that's its,\nits very easy to work with.\n\n373\n00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:38.750\nAnd in this one think about this I can\nfilter this, this is a user setting,\n\n374\n00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.250\nright, so its linked to,\n\n375\n00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:45.030\nand I don't even know what this was linked\nto I think its linked to my employees OU.\n\n376\n00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:50.440\nBut I could say and their computer\nis a member of a particular OU.\n\n377\n00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.500\nSo even though the GPO is not\nlinked to that OU, I could say\n\n378\n00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:59.250\nI want to use that as a basis on whether\nor not to apply this particular setting.\n\n379\n00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:02.290\nNow I'm gonna remove this because\nI honestly can't remember what\n\n380\n00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:03.710\nOU these guys are in.\n\n381\n00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:07.150\nSo I'll just do Windows 8 and\nwe'll click, or you know what?\n\n382\n00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.220\nLet's do something different.\n\n383\n00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:14.760\nLet's say that their security group, I'm\n\n384\n00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:19.800\ngonna remove this one, and that the, you\nknow, I don't even have a group, Ronnie.\n\n385\n00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.130\nLet's go make one real quick.\n\n386\n00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:21.630\n>> Sounds good.\n\n387\n00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.950\n>> Alright so we're coming here and\nwe're gonna make a new group and\n\n388\n00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.250\nI'll just dump it in the OUs here and\n\n389\n00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:33.460\nI'll call it dev team or something,\nwe'll call it dev, right?\n\n390\n00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.650\nAnd when we come back we'll make\na change to that in just a second, so\n\n391\n00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:39.900\nlet's do that all again cuz I kind\nof rambled on there for a minute.\n\n392\n00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.160\nSo we're gonna modify this notepad\nshortcut that we're trying to\n\n393\n00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.020\nput on their desktop.\n\n394\n00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:51.220\nAnd I'm gonna do item level targeting,\nand I wanna say if they're in the group.\n\n395\n00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.090\nAnd then I'm gonna find that group\nthat I just created called Dev.\n\n396\n00:21:54.090 --> 00:22:01.160\nSo you can see now it says LAB Dev\nif the user is in that group.\n\n397\n00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.300\nAnd I'll click OK on that one, and\nI'll click OK on our properties here.\n\n398\n00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.010\nSo that's our item level targeting.\n\n399\n00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:10.980\nReally cool, easy to use filtering.\n\n400\n00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.320\nNo WMI queries.\n\n401\n00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:16.960\nNo security filtering I can do ti straight\nthrough those drop down lists, all right?\n\n402\n00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:22.200\nSo now I've got a few different\nsettings applied in this GPO, right.\n\n403\n00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.930\nBut that shortcut one is gonna be\nfiltered to only if you belong\n\n404\n00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:29.730\nto that particular group and\nnobody's in that group yet, right.\n\n405\n00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:34.295\nSo let's close this editor and\nlet's flip back over to my client,\n\n406\n00:22:34.295 --> 00:22:37.645\nlet's make sure I know where\nthat policy is linked at Ronnie.\n\n407\n00:22:37.645 --> 00:22:39.135\nBecause that is gonna make a difference,\n\n408\n00:22:39.135 --> 00:22:43.835\nso that's linked to the employees OU\nwhich should affect all employees right?\n\n409\n00:22:43.835 --> 00:22:47.215\nThat's where all my user accounts are,\nso we're gonna come over here and\n\n410\n00:22:47.215 --> 00:22:48.005\nwe're gonna log off.\n\n411\n00:22:51.021 --> 00:22:52.050\nAnd we're gonna log back on.\n\n412\n00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:56.569\nI could have just as easily done\na GP update, because this works,\n\n413\n00:22:56.569 --> 00:23:00.853\nthese preferences refresh at\nthe same time as my policies do.\n\n414\n00:23:03.325 --> 00:23:04.090\nAnd we'll see what we get.\n\n415\n00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:09.340\nSo what, you know now I have to remember\nall those crazy settings that we did.\n\n416\n00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.740\nLet's see, we made a shortcut,\n\n417\n00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:16.070\nbut the shortcut's only gonna be if you're\nin that group, so I don't have a shortcut.\n\n418\n00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:19.060\nI should have a map network drive.\n\n419\n00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:23.610\nI should also have a folder\ncalled Stuff on my C drive.\n\n420\n00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:27.190\nSo you see everything's kicking\nin except for that shortcut.\n\n421\n00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.770\nNow let's go add Rob's\naccount to that group.\n\n422\n00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:34.748\nFor that, I'll switch over to\nactive directory, users and\n\n423\n00:23:34.748 --> 00:23:39.446\ncomputers, and\nI'll find that group and I'll add Rob.\n\n424\n00:23:43.997 --> 00:23:46.837\nAll right, so\nnow Rob is a part of that group.\n\n425\n00:23:46.837 --> 00:23:49.895\nSo I'm gonna come over here and\nfor his group membership and\n\n426\n00:23:49.895 --> 00:23:52.046\nremember I need to log off and\nlog back on.\n\n427\n00:23:52.046 --> 00:23:56.850\nTo update my access token so that it has\nmy new group membership included in it.\n\n428\n00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:02.295\nSo I'll log off, I'll log back on as Rob,\n\n429\n00:24:02.295 --> 00:24:06.229\nlike I remember his password,\n\n430\n00:24:06.229 --> 00:24:12.755\nflip over to my desktop,\nand give it just a second.\n\n431\n00:24:12.755 --> 00:24:14.370\nIt didn't do my little shortcut.\n\n432\n00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:20.190\n>> Probably needs a moment to,\nlet's see here, if we do a,\n\n433\n00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:26.180\na little GP update we'll see if we\ncan get that thing to refresh there.\n\n434\n00:24:30.395 --> 00:24:32.985\nSo anyway it should make\nthat shortcut in a minute,\n\n435\n00:24:32.985 --> 00:24:35.556\nas long as I've got that group membership,\nright?\n\n436\n00:24:35.556 --> 00:24:37.123\nSo, fantastic ability.\n\n437\n00:24:37.123 --> 00:24:40.635\nAnd while we're waiting for that to kick\nin, we'll troubleshoot real quick and make\n\n438\n00:24:40.635 --> 00:24:44.745\nsure I didn't set anything wrong, because\nI have been known to do that before.\n\n439\n00:24:44.745 --> 00:24:49.076\nSo we're going to take a look\nat the settings here, and\n\n440\n00:24:49.076 --> 00:24:53.325\nwe'll do a little, show all,\nand I got my drive map.\n\n441\n00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:55.600\nWhere is my shortcuts?\n\n442\n00:24:58.598 --> 00:25:00.700\nI don't have my shortcut list up there.\n\n443\n00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.870\n>> You may have cancelled it\nout instead of saving it.\n\n444\n00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:06.510\n>> I might of, let's edit that again,\nand see what I did.\n\n445\n00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:10.632\nSo we'll go under preferences, and\nthen control, whoops not control panel,\n\n446\n00:25:10.632 --> 00:25:14.210\nWindows settings, and\nthen shortcuts there it is, so it's there.\n\n447\n00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:17.600\nI'm going to create a shortcut\ncalled Notepad on the desktop.\n\n448\n00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.672\nI've got my path,\nmake sure I type that right, C:/windows,\n\n449\n00:25:21.672 --> 00:25:26.410\nsystem32notepad.exe, and\nthen on my comment tab,\n\n450\n00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:31.410\nI did my item-level targeting, so the user\nis a measure of the security group dev, so\n\n451\n00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:33.750\nwe should be good to go there.\n\n452\n00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.660\nI'm going to click OK, and\nOK, I'm going to click OK.\n\n453\n00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.120\nWe'll flip back over here and\nwe'll just restart this machine.\n\n454\n00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:49.130\nIt was a user setting, so it really should\napply logging off and logging back on.\n\n455\n00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:52.880\nSometimes we can cache policies,\nthough, to speed the processing up and\n\n456\n00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.910\nso just to make sure I'm going\nto go ahead and reboot that guy.\n\n457\n00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:57.660\nThe other thing I want to talk\nabout while we're waiting for\n\n458\n00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.380\nthis to reboot Is that registry entry.\n\n459\n00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.820\nThat is another one of my favorites.\n\n460\n00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.790\nIf you can't tell I love preferences.\n\n461\n00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:06.730\nThey are easy to work with, and\n\n462\n00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.790\nthey really do extend that\nfunctionality of group policy.\n\n463\n00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:14.420\nThe registry ones are fantastic,\nif you've ever had to deploy\n\n464\n00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:18.560\na registry key,\nthat can be challenging, right?\n\n465\n00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.890\nWe had an application here\nthat we used one time.\n\n466\n00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:26.264\nThat In order for that application to work\nI needed to do a registry entry on all\n\n467\n00:26:26.264 --> 00:26:27.693\nthose client machines.\n\n468\n00:26:27.693 --> 00:26:32.688\nSo what I did was I used that group policy\npreference on my domain controller I made\n\n469\n00:26:32.688 --> 00:26:37.021\nthe registry entry and then I fired\nup that group policy management and\n\n470\n00:26:37.021 --> 00:26:39.380\nsaid hey go look at this registry key.\n\n471\n00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:43.543\nAnd it basically took a picture of it,\nsaid okay, I see it and\n\n472\n00:26:43.543 --> 00:26:45.829\nit copied it into the GPO for me and\n\n473\n00:26:45.829 --> 00:26:50.810\nnow I can deploy that registry key\nusing that GPO, it was fantastic.\n\n474\n00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:54.840\nSo, I'll log back in in Rob and\nsee if that setting kicks in,\n\n475\n00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:59.950\nit's usually just a patience things and\nI am not so we'll flip over the desktop.\n\n476\n00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.590\nAnd sure enough,\nthere's my shortcut for Notepad.\n\n477\n00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:07.510\nSo you saw that it wasn't there\nbefore I put Rob in that group.\n\n478\n00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:10.015\nOnce I put Rob in that group,\nthat setting kicks in.\n\n479\n00:27:10.015 --> 00:27:13.870\nThat's that item-level targeting that\nI can do with those preferences,\n\n480\n00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:18.960\nwhich basically does the same thing as\nsecurity filtering, with my GPO settings.\n\n481\n00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.310\nLast thing, Ronnie, that I want to\nshow everybody is the registry one,\n\n482\n00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:24.750\nbecause that's another\none of my favorites.\n\n483\n00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.060\nI'm going to come back here and\nedit that same policy.\n\n484\n00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:30.660\nI don't think we'll test it out,\nbut I do want to show you.\n\n485\n00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.640\nIf I go under preferences up\nhere under the computer half,\n\n486\n00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:37.230\nhere's this registry item, and\nwe can do it a couple of ways.\n\n487\n00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:40.850\nWhen I right click and choose new,\nI can do new registry item.\n\n488\n00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:43.380\nSo if I simply want to create a new key or\n\n489\n00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:48.770\nmodify an existing key, I can type my\ninformation in there and I'm good to go.\n\n490\n00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:54.340\nThe one I really like though,\nis this registry wizard, all right.\n\n491\n00:27:54.340 --> 00:28:00.150\nWhat this allows me to do is go\nfind a machine that has the key.\n\n492\n00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:04.660\nI gave that example about the application\nthat we are running, right?\n\n493\n00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:08.460\nSo I configure one of my machines\non my network with that setting,\n\n494\n00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:12.130\nhave this guy browse to that machine,\nlook at it's registry.\n\n495\n00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:14.230\nFigure out what it is that I changed and\n\n496\n00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:17.890\nthen apply it to all other machines\nthat I scope this policy to.\n\n497\n00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:22.340\nSo you can come in here, you can say the\nlocal computer, and can go find that key,\n\n498\n00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:27.080\nlet's say I'm just going to grab one for\ndemo purposes.\n\n499\n00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.750\nI don't even know which one I want.\n\n500\n00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:33.450\nLet's just say I grab that one,\nI click finish, right, and that's it.\n\n501\n00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:36.085\nIt will now go and\nwhen I apply this policy,\n\n502\n00:28:36.085 --> 00:28:40.070\nit'll create that registry entry on\nwhoever this policy is scoped to.\n\n503\n00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:43.360\nAnd think I can still do my item\nlevel targeting with these things,\n\n504\n00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:49.150\nI can still control which machine based on\nlike operating system or what have you.\n\n505\n00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:49.890\nWith those settings.\n\n506\n00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:53.500\nSo in the end,\npreferences are really neat.\n\n507\n00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.930\nThey extend the functionality\nof group policy objects\n\n508\n00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:58.920\nto do things that we couldn't do before.\n\n509\n00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.550\nAnd they're just very easy to work with,\nI don't have that WQL to learn.\n\n510\n00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.490\nI don't have to worry\nabout security filtering,\n\n511\n00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:07.690\nit's all wizard, drop-down list based.\n\n512\n00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:08.560\nPretty darn cool.\n\n513\n00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.980\n>> It really is, Mike.\n\n514\n00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.710\nBeing though that you usually use policies\nare really one of the things that allow us\n\n515\n00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:17.760\nto look like we're setting things in place\nto make it more easy for our end users.\n\n516\n00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.430\nThat same time it gives\nthem also the flexibility\n\n517\n00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:22.600\nto be able to change them if they need to.\n\n518\n00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.310\nSo, unlike a policy in which they can't\nchange anything with the preferences.\n\n519\n00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:29.600\nThey can go ahead and say look,\nhey that's not my default printer, and\n\n520\n00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.570\nactually be able to change that.\n\n521\n00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:33.060\nAnd a lot of times they can do that\nwith the other settings as well.\n\n522\n00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.980\nSo it makes it nice and\neasy for us as administrators,\n\n523\n00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.310\nit makes it easy to let the users\nknow that we've got it set, but\n\n524\n00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:42.070\nthen if they do need to change\nit they can change it also.\n\n525\n00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.130\nMike, as far as policies and\n\n526\n00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:47.630\npreferences combined together,\nthey shouldn't conflict with each other.\n\n527\n00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:48.750\nEverything should work fine, right?\n\n528\n00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:51.032\n>> Yeah, absolutely, never conflict.\n\n529\n00:29:51.032 --> 00:29:54.460\n[LAUGH] Now, same thing would apply\nthough if we've got policies or\n\n530\n00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.260\npreference settings, you know,\nlinked to different levels.\n\n531\n00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:00.130\nYou still have that same inheritance and\n\n532\n00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:04.230\nprecedence to deal with, so\nif you've got a later policy can override,\n\n533\n00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:08.232\na previously applied policy so\nin the end it all works the same.\n\n534\n00:30:08.232 --> 00:30:10.890\n>> Excellent, all right,\nthat's a great place for us go for and\n\n535\n00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:12.290\nend this episode, then.\n\n536\n00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.710\nSigning off for ITProTV I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n537\n00:30:14.710 -->

00:00:19.140\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're taking that Working\n\n4\n00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.630\nwith Group Policy, when we talk\nabout working with Group Policy,\n\n5\n00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.460\nwe're normally actually making a lot\nof different settings and changes.\n\n6\n00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.370\nBut today we're actually taking\na little bit of a detour and\n\n7\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.420\nwe're actually talking about\nusing security templates instead.\n\n8\n00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.450\nAnd actually using that along\nwith Group Policy as well.\n\n9\n00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.910\nAnd who better than to help us?\n\n10\n00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.450\nWell, Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.125\nNow Mike, security templates\nare not exactly Group Policy.\n\n12\n00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:41.240\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n13\n00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.790\n>> And even though I know Group Policy\ncan help us, is there a reason for\n\n14\n00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.290\nme to use security templates.\n\n15\n00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.370\n>> Yeah there are.\n\n16\n00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.570\nSecurity templates are basically a subset\nof the settings you'd find in a GPO.\n\n17\n00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.900\nAnd we'll see what I mean\nhere in just a second.\n\n18\n00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.260\nSo if you were to take a slice of those\nsettings, and it's the security settings,\n\n19\n00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.380\nhence the name security templates.\n\n20\n00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.930\nTake those out of a GPO,\n\n21\n00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.340\nnow I can work with those settings\noutside of the group policy environment.\n\n22\n00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.100\nWhy would that be advantageous?\n\n23\n00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.190\nWell, I can give somebody,\n\n24\n00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.740\nI could delegate to somebody the job of\ncreating these security templates and\n\n25\n00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.300\ngoing through the myriad of settings\nthat I can configure in there.\n\n26\n00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.880\nBut I don't have to give them any\npermissions in Active Directory.\n\n27\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.930\nI don't have to give them any\npermissions inside a Group Policy.\n\n28\n00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.710\nIn fact,\nthey can test it on a local machine.\n\n29\n00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.500\nThey can import those\nsettings into a local policy,\n\n30\n00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.130\nthey could configure a machine And\nactually compare the settings that are on\n\n31\n00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.680\nthe machine with the template and\nget it all straightened out and\n\n32\n00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.720\ntested, and then give that template to\nsomebody that does have permissions in\n\n33\n00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.320\nActive Directory and Group Policy,\nand they can simply import.\n\n34\n00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.830\nThat template into that GPO.\n\n35\n00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.710\nSo that's the big advantage there is being\nable to be kinda break it up into smaller\n\n36\n00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.910\nresponsibilities and not have to\nmake somebody's say, an admin, or\n\n37\n00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.750\ngive them permissions to create Group\nPolicy, because if I give them the ability\n\n38\n00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.310\nto create Group Policy,\nthey can make a policy and\n\n39\n00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.280\nlink it somewhere or create policies\nthat didn't do what we wanted it to do.\n\n40\n00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.460\nRight?\nWe always talk about principle of least\n\n41\n00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.870\nprivilege and that's really where\nthese security templates come in.\n\n42\n00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.810\nAnd, they're reusable, right?\n\n43\n00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.820\nBecause I'm gonna import\nthat template into a GPO.\n\n44\n00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.690\nIf I need those same\nsettings in a different GPO,\n\n45\n00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.780\nI can simply import that\ntemplate into the GPO.\n\n46\n00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.970\nEditing the template in the future is just\na matter of opening up my snap in and\n\n47\n00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.540\nworking with that template.\n\n48\n00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.800\nI don't have to go into Group Policy.\n\n49\n00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.740\nI don't have to remote into domain\ncontroller or anything like that.\n\n50\n00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.990\nI can do it all right here on my Windows\n8 or my Windows 7 or my Windows 10 box.\n\n51\n00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.480\nSo a few advantages to these templates.\n\n52\n00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.940\n>> Now, Mike,\nthey actually sound kind of complicated.\n\n53\n00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.171\nDo I have to learn some type of scripting?\n\n54\n00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:49.609\nIs there anything I really\nhave to kind of focus in on,\n\n55\n00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.629\nso I can get used to\nthe security templates?\n\n56\n00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.160\n>> There's not.\n\n57\n00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.650\nThey make it really easy.\n\n58\n00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.250\nIt's a snap-in that we can use, and\n\n59\n00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.960\nyou're probably familiar with\nthis point at the snap-ins.\n\n60\n00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.780\nHeck, all those Active Directory\ntools that we use?\n\n61\n00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.160\nUsers and computers, Group Policy\nmanagement, those are snap-ins.\n\n62\n00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.230\nThey're just prebuilt snap-ins.\n\n63\n00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.260\nBut we're going to create our own\ncustom snap-in, our own custom tool.\n\n64\n00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.570\nLet's take a look at my screen and I'll\nshow you how to go through this process.\n\n65\n00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.680\nI'm on my windows A1 box and\nall I'm going to do is create a blank MMC.\n\n66\n00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.480\nSo we're gonna type in MMC, short for\nMicrosoft Management Console.\n\n67\n00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.630\nThat opens up this blank tool and\nit should look familiar.\n\n68\n00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.490\nI've got a navigation tree down on the\nleft hand side, I've got a details area\n\n69\n00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.050\nout here in the middle, and then I've\ngot an actions pane down the right.\n\n70\n00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.160\nThat's like all the other\ntools that we use,\n\n71\n00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.730\nand that's the idea about\nhow fun Microsoft is.\n\n72\n00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.580\nHey, if all the tools\nhave the same layout,\n\n73\n00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.590\nyou're not confused when you open a tool.\n\n74\n00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.440\nRight?\nYou know where to go or\n\n75\n00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.290\nwhat to look for at least.\n\n76\n00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.220\nSo if I go, File, Add/Remove Snap-in,\nI get a list of snap-ins.\n\n77\n00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.220\nNow, I'm on my Windows 8 machine,\nwhich means I don't have as many, but\n\n78\n00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.140\nif I was on a domain controller,\nin fact, here.\n\n79\n00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.460\nLet's just take a look.\n\n80\n00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.040\nInstead of saying what if, hey,\nI've got a domain controller here.\n\n81\n00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.870\nI'll show you what I mean.\n\n82\n00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.410\nI could create an MMC over here.\n\n83\n00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.530\nDo a File, Add/Remove Snap-in.\n\n84\n00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.540\nLook, there's Active Directory\nusing the computers.\n\n85\n00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.530\nThere's DNS.\n\n86\n00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.930\nLet's see, I don't have DHCP\ninstalled on this machine.\n\n87\n00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.960\nThere's Group Policy Management,\nlet's see which one that is.\n\n88\n00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.050\nThere's Group Policy Management.\n\n89\n00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.750\nWe'll add that one and we'll click OK.\n\n90\n00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.870\nAnd so if these are some of my primary\nfunctions, I now have one tool, right,\n\n91\n00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.890\nthis one window that I can work with\nActive Directory, I can work with DNS,\n\n92\n00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.950\nand I can work with Group Policy,\nall right, all in the same little tool.\n\n93\n00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.130\nI could save this.\n\n94\n00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.300\nFor future use.\n\n95\n00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.980\nSo that's the big\nadvantage of those MMCs is\n\n96\n00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.050\nbeing able to put those snap-ins in there.\n\n97\n00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.330\nNow over here on the client, because I\ndon't have my remote server admin tools\n\n98\n00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.720\ninstalled, I don't have\nsome of those snap-ins.\n\n99\n00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.270\nBut if I needed them, I could install the\nremote server administration tools, and\n\n100\n00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.760\nI'd have all those same\nsnap-ins on my client, right?\n\n101\n00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.250\nFor us though, for this one, I'm going\nto scroll down just a little bit.\n\n102\n00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.640\nAnd I'm gonna go with security templates\nand I'm gonna go ahead and click add and\n\n103\n00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.410\nyou know what, we should take a look\nat the security configuration and\n\n104\n00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.950\nanalysis while we're in there.\n\n105\n00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.210\nWe'll add that one too and we'll click OK.\n\n106\n00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.650\nNow I've got my tools and\nnormally what I would do is I'd save this.\n\n107\n00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.380\nAnd I might dump it out to my desktop and\ncall it MyConsole you know or\n\n108\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.590\nwhatever I want, we'll just say that.\n\n109\n00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.280\nAnd now that's any time I need to\nwork with those tools, there it is.\n\n110\n00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.680\nI just launch it up and we're good to go.\n\n111\n00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.540\nLove my MMCs, just a little\ndetour there for just a second.\n\n112\n00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.780\nSo let's get back over to\nthe security templates.\n\n113\n00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.800\nNow when we talk about security templates,\nagain its a subset of GPOs.\n\n114\n00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.400\nI don't have any to start with\nwhen I first create this console,\n\n115\n00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.360\nit just has this path.\n\n116\n00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.410\nC:\\Users\\Administrators, so my profile,\n\n117\n00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.570\nwho I'm logged on as\nDocuments\\Security\\Templates.\n\n118\n00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.130\nSo it's gonna create this folder\nstructure within my documents folder, and\n\n119\n00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.438\nthe first thing I would need to\ndo is create a new template.\n\n120\n00:06:14.438 --> 00:06:17.710\nSo I right-click on there and\nchoose New Template.\n\n121\n00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.730\nI'll give it a name, and\nI'm gonna call this my, I don't know,\n\n122\n00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.020\nwe'll call it ITPro settings or something.\n\n123\n00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.350\nI'll just call it IT pro for\nshort, and I'll click okay.\n\n124\n00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.100\nSo now I got this new\ntemplate called ITPro, but\n\n125\n00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.510\njust like a GPO, it's basically blank,\nit has a bunch of settings in it,\n\n126\n00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.960\nbut they're not configured yet, and if\nyou look at this, try to remember these,\n\n127\n00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.860\nAccount, Local, Event Log, Restricted\nGroups, System Services, Registry,\n\n128\n00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.890\nFile System, got all those memorized?\n\n129\n00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:49.470\nOkay.\n\n130\n00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.850\nNow we're gonna switch back\nover here to a Group Policy and\n\n131\n00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.690\nI'm going to use my new console,\nas a matter of fact.\n\n132\n00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.630\nRight-click on this guy,\nsoon as I get rid of my little warning,\n\n133\n00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.620\nand choose Edit and underneath Policies\nand then Windows Settings, and\n\n134\n00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.140\nthen Security Settings,\nthis should look familiar.\n\n135\n00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.080\nAccount, Local, Event Log,\nRestricted Groups, System Services,\n\n136\n00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.540\nRegistry, File System.\n\n137\n00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.480\nSo you see what I'm saying?\n\n138\n00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.610\nThis is just a subset of all the settings\nthat are available in a normal GPU.\n\n139\n00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.570\nSo like Ronnie was saying earlier\nit just sort of vanished because I\n\n140\n00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.450\ncould go to the GPU itself.\n\n141\n00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.650\nAnd configure all of these\nsettings right here.\n\n142\n00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.160\nBut, the person I want to do this,\n\n143\n00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.510\ndoesn't have permission to remote\ninto the domain controller, or\n\n144\n00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.540\nthey don't have RSAT installed, so they\ncan't get access to Group Policy remotely.\n\n145\n00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.090\nSo they can add this snap-in and\nthey can work with these settings.\n\n146\n00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:49.130\nAll the same settings are there, Account\nPolicies, my Local Policies, all of that.\n\n147\n00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.030\nAll right, so for an example,\nI think we're gonna do one called\n\n148\n00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.353\nRestricted Groups,\nbecause this is another one.\n\n149\n00:07:54.353 --> 00:07:57.187\nRemember lately we've been towards\nthe end of these episodes.\n\n150\n00:07:57.187 --> 00:07:59.621\nWe've been doing some\ncommon configurations.\n\n151\n00:07:59.621 --> 00:08:03.690\nThings that we use group policy for\nin most network environments.\n\n152\n00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.220\nRestricted groups is another one of those.\n\n153\n00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.100\nIt's a setting that is very handy.\n\n154\n00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.720\nWhat it allows me to do is to\ncontrol local group membership.\n\n155\n00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.460\nI can take domain accounts and\ndomain groups for that matter and\n\n156\n00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.620\nI can add them to local groups.\n\n157\n00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.211\nAnd think we'll Mike,\nyou can do that anyway, right?\n\n158\n00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:24.545\nYou can open up computer\nmanagement on that machine and\n\n159\n00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:26.850\nyou can add that domain group in there.\n\n160\n00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.190\nBut I don't want to have\nto do that every time.\n\n161\n00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.230\nIn a company I used to work for,\n\n162\n00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:37.290\nwe needed a domain account to be in\nthe local admin's group on every machine,\n\n163\n00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.980\nso that if they needed to they could\ninstall software and do what have you.\n\n164\n00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.350\nBut we reimage the machines every week.\n\n165\n00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:49.250\nSo that meant if I ran around to all 120\nmachines, added that person into that\n\n166\n00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:53.000\ngroup, on each machine one at a time,\nthat was a lot of work.\n\n167\n00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.810\nAnd guess what I had to do next week?\n\n168\n00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.680\n>> Do it again.\n>> [LAUGHTER] The same thing, right?\n\n169\n00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.090\nAll over again.\n\n170\n00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.340\nWhereas restricted groups\nis a group policy.\n\n171\n00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.550\nSo if I reimage that machine it comes\nback online, this policy applies,\n\n172\n00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:07.100\nand boom, they're in that group again.\n\n173\n00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.480\nI didn't have to do anything.\n\n174\n00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.584\nThat's the centralised\nconfiguration management, right?\n\n175\n00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:15.554\nSo I'll right click on restricted\ngroups and choose add group.\n\n176\n00:09:15.554 --> 00:09:19.465\nNow when this dialogue box opens, the\nfirst thing I have to do is decide what\n\n177\n00:09:19.465 --> 00:09:21.962\ngroup am I trying to\ncontrol the membership of?\n\n178\n00:09:21.962 --> 00:09:24.322\nSo I'm going to click browse,\nand I want to find,\n\n179\n00:09:24.322 --> 00:09:27.210\nor I'm sorry I'm not going\nto type browse on that one.\n\n180\n00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.120\nI'm just going to do the local\nadministrators group.\n\n181\n00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.100\nSpell that right, and I'll click OK.\n\n182\n00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.490\nAnd it opens up the properties for\nthe local administrators group.\n\n183\n00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:38.980\nAnd I've got two options here.\n\n184\n00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:45.300\nOne is members of this group the bottom\none is this group is a member of.\n\n185\n00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.200\nSo with the top one,\n\n186\n00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.770\nI'm deciding who's gonna be\na member of the local admins group.\n\n187\n00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:56.450\nThe bottom one is saying the local admins\ngroup is gonna be added to another group,\n\n188\n00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.960\nwhatever groups I list there, right.\n\n189\n00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.460\nThis top one, they behave differently as\nwell, the top one is an exclusive list.\n\n190\n00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.130\nIn other words,\nI'm going to add help desk.\n\n191\n00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.140\nSo I'm going to browse,\nI'm gonna find my group called help desk.\n\n192\n00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:14.010\nBecause I need my help desk employees\nto be a local admin on all of my client\n\n193\n00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.630\nmachines so they can troubleshoot,\nfix things, what have you.\n\n194\n00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.510\nSo I'm going to add them in there.\n\n195\n00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.010\nAll right, and I'll click OK.\n\n196\n00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.970\nWhen I do this,\nthis list becomes exclusive.\n\n197\n00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:29.420\nThese are the only people that will be in\nthe local administrators group except for\n\n198\n00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.720\nthe administrative account itself,\nthat built in administrator account.\n\n199\n00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.750\nSo if my end user happened to be\na member of the local admin's group on\n\n200\n00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.980\ntheir machine, when this policy applies,\nthey will no longer be in that group.\n\n201\n00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.740\nIt'll remove everybody that is\nnot in this list, except for\n\n202\n00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.290\nthe administrators, right?\n\n203\n00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:48.360\nWhich is a good thing.\n\n204\n00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.190\nWhat if one of my users figures out a way\nto get themselves added to the local\n\n205\n00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.390\nadmins group?\n\n206\n00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.050\nThey might be in their for a little bit,\nbut as soon as this policy\n\n207\n00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.272\nrefreshes every 90 minutes,\nit's gonna take them right back out.\n\n208\n00:10:59.272 --> 00:11:01.310\nAll right, so this is a way to control or\n\n209\n00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:05.190\nrestrict that membership as well as,\nyou know, add people to that group.\n\n210\n00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:11.630\nSo help desk, the bottom one this group is\na member of, this is an inclusive list.\n\n211\n00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.850\nIn other words if I added\nthe administrator's group to I don't\n\n212\n00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.170\nknow the power operator's group\nyou know or something like that.\n\n213\n00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.660\nThat wouldn't really\nmake sense [LAUGH] but.\n\n214\n00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.290\nIt wouldn't remove anything,\nit would only add.\n\n215\n00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:27.590\nIt would make sure that this group was,\nin addition to whatever already listed,\n\n216\n00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.420\na member of that group, right?\n\n217\n00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.970\nSo the top one removes everything and\n\n218\n00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.550\nsays what you've got here is the only\nthing that's gonna be in there.\n\n219\n00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:38.120\nThe bottom one says, I'm gonna add\nthis to whatever's already in there.\n\n220\n00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.745\n>> So it kind of appends\nthat group into that group.\n\n221\n00:11:40.745 --> 00:11:42.830\n>> [LAUGH] That's exactly.\n\n222\n00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.430\nIt's kinda hard to verbalize,\nisn't it, but yes, it does.\n\n223\n00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.578\nIt appends group into that group, yes.\n\n224\n00:11:47.578 --> 00:11:53.490\n[LAUGH] All right, and so\nI'll click OK on that, and that's it.\n\n225\n00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:57.110\nIt's really that easy to set\nup the restrictive group.\n\n226\n00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:00.630\nSo it's a fantastic thing like I said,\nit saved us.\n\n227\n00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:05.270\nSo much time on several occasions,\nwhere I need to take a domain account and\n\n228\n00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.870\nput it in to a local group.\n\n229\n00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.030\nOr a domain group, right?\n\n230\n00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.290\nLike i just did the help desk and\nput it in to a local group and\n\n231\n00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.870\nif i reimage my machines I don't have\nto worry about doing it aga in, right?\n\n232\n00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.240\nBecause every time policy\napplies this is gonna happen.\n\n233\n00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.060\nThat's the advantage there.\n\n234\n00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.260\nAll right, and\nas you can see all the rest of this,\n\n235\n00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.330\nthere's a bunch of other security\nsettings that we could do.\n\n236\n00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.290\nI'm gonna leave,\nI'm just gonna do this one.\n\n237\n00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:31.050\nI wanna spend a little bit of time\ntalking about the template itself.\n\n238\n00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:35.160\nSo now what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna save this template.\n\n239\n00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.060\nYou gotta remember to do that.\n\n240\n00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.200\nIs sometimes it will not prompt\nyou to save this template.\n\n241\n00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.600\nSo make sure you right click on it and\nchoose save.\n\n242\n00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.130\nAnd I right clicked on\nthe template itself, right?\n\n243\n00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.840\nThe name of the template, and chose save.\n\n244\n00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.060\nAnd that's gonna go inside that\nsecurity templates folder.\n\n245\n00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:56.790\nIn fact, if I open up my documents,\nI'll see a folder called security and\n\n246\n00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:02.480\ntemplates, and there is that security\ntemplate that we just saved, all right.\n\n247\n00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.680\nNow the next thing that I would do then\nis I could take this to that GPO and\n\n248\n00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.840\nI could import it.\n\n249\n00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.420\nI do want to show you this\nother tool here though that,\n\n250\n00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.660\nkinda goes hand in hand with\nworking with these templates.\n\n251\n00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.280\nSecurity Configuration and Analysis.\n\n252\n00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.540\nWhat this allows me to do is analyze\nthe current settings on a machine\n\n253\n00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.260\nversus a template.\n\n254\n00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.090\nAnd see how they compare.\n\n255\n00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:26.090\nWhat if my job was to configure\none of these templates?\n\n256\n00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:30.120\nWhat I could do, is configure all\nthe settings on the machine itself.\n\n257\n00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.080\nOr maybe my admin comes to me and\nsays, hey I want you to take\n\n258\n00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:37.060\nthe settings that are on this machine and\nI want to make a group policy\n\n259\n00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.880\nthat is going to implement these\nsettings on all these other machines.\n\n260\n00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.500\nWell I don't want to go\nthrough one at a time and\n\n261\n00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.470\ntry to figure out what those settings are.\n\n262\n00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:48.840\nThis tool can help me analyze the machine,\ncompare it against this template.\n\n263\n00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.450\nMake a template and I'm good to go.\n\n264\n00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:51.980\nLet me show you how.\n\n265\n00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.750\nThe first thing you need is a workspace,\nand they call it a database here.\n\n266\n00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.660\nSo you're gonna right-click and\n\n267\n00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.210\nchoose open database,\neven though you don't have one, I know.\n\n268\n00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.110\nInstead of create it says open.\n\n269\n00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:07.720\nAnd we'll do that and we'll give it\na name, I'm gonna call this IT pro.\n\n270\n00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.921\nWell, just leave it at that,\nI could spell it again, we'll click Open.\n\n271\n00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.100\nAnd then what template do I wanna compare?\n\n272\n00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.421\nWell there's my ITPro template that\nI made earlier also like that one and\n\n273\n00:14:21.421 --> 00:14:22.480\nthen I'll click Open.\n\n274\n00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.510\nThen you're gonna right-click on it again,\nand choose analyze computer now.\n\n275\n00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.149\nAnd you give it a path for\nthe log file, you click OK.\n\n276\n00:14:31.149 --> 00:14:35.990\nAnd now, I've got those settings down here\nand let's take a look at what we've got.\n\n277\n00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:40.100\nIf we go into like restricted groups,\nI can see the group name,\n\n278\n00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.700\nadministrators, members.\n\n279\n00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:47.290\nIt says,\nI don't know why it says investigate, and\n\n280\n00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.870\nthen members of, says okay.\n\n281\n00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:53.880\nSo those are my, trying to think\nof a good way to explain that,\n\n282\n00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.160\nthis one really doesn't compare\nwhat's going on on the local machine.\n\n283\n00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.790\nBecause this isn't a setting that you\nwould see on a local machine, right?\n\n284\n00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:04.520\nit's a setting that I plan on\napplying to the local machine.\n\n285\n00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.980\nThe rest of them, like password policies.\n\n286\n00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.950\nHere's what the computer is set to,\nhere's what the database setting is.\n\n287\n00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.680\nThe database is my template.\n\n288\n00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.840\nLet's do this, let's try that again, let's\nconfigure something slightly different.\n\n289\n00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.620\nLet's go to PasswordPolicy, and\nwe're gonna say, maximum password age.\n\n290\n00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:28.009\nI want them to change their password\nevery 30 days instead of every 42 days.\n\n291\n00:15:28.009 --> 00:15:33.977\nAll right, it is not now 30 is it?\n\n292\n00:15:33.977 --> 00:15:38.208\nAll right, minimum password age set to 29,\nminimum password length,\n\n293\n00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:40.470\nlet's change that to ten characters.\n\n294\n00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.100\nAnd I'll go ahead and click OK.\n\n295\n00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.630\nSo just something so we'll have\na little bit of difference there.\n\n296\n00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:50.212\nI will save it.\n\n297\n00:15:50.212 --> 00:15:53.901\nRight, and then we come down here and\n\n298\n00:15:53.901 --> 00:15:57.958\nchoose to, let's do import template.\n\n299\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:02.744\nAnd we're gonna grab that template we\nmade those changes to and then Analyze\n\n300\n00:16:02.744 --> 00:16:07.890\ncomputer now, and now we'll have\nsomething a little more fun to look at.\n\n301\n00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:11.270\nWe'll go to Password Policy, and\nnow I can see the difference.\n\n302\n00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:15.340\nHere's what the computer is currently set\nto, here's what that template is set to.\n\n303\n00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.290\nAnd you can see it immediately\nidentifies the differences.\n\n304\n00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.390\nThose red x's are telling me that\nsomething the computer is set to,\n\n305\n00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.000\ndoes not agree with something\nthat the template is set to.\n\n306\n00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:31.160\nSo if, I was just trying to\nconfigure this one machine,\n\n307\n00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.860\nbasically what I would do now is say\nyou know what I forgot that setting.\n\n308\n00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.290\nI want that database\nto say the same thing.\n\n309\n00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:41.260\nI can actually change it from right here,\ndefine this policy in the database.\n\n310\n00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.780\nClick OK and oops,\nI actually didn't change it.\n\n311\n00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:46.699\nThat was silly right?\n\n312\n00:16:46.699 --> 00:16:49.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's change that to 24.\n\n313\n00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:53.510\nWe're gonna copy the parent computer\nsetting over to my template.\n\n314\n00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:58.360\n[COUGH] So that's what's we use this tool\nfor is to like I said if you already had\n\n315\n00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.640\na computer configured the way you\nwanted to create the template.\n\n316\n00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.270\nYou do this analysis and then you just\nmove the settings over from computer to\n\n317\n00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:10.250\ndatabase and in the end now you have\na template with all of those settings.\n\n318\n00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:13.300\nAnd I can use that template then to apply.\n\n319\n00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.110\nIf I wanted to apply these setting\njust to an individual machine,\n\n320\n00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:18.800\nI could do it from right here,\nI could go to another machine.\n\n321\n00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.130\nIf I stored that template\nup in a shared location,\n\n322\n00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:25.210\nI go to another machine,\nI open up security configuration analysis,\n\n323\n00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.240\nI would import that template and\nconfigure computer now.\n\n324\n00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.300\nAnd that would apply\nthe template to this machine.\n\n325\n00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.490\nBut in the end, what we're typically\ntrying to do is bring these into a GPU.\n\n326\n00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.560\nSo let's go back to our original scenario.\n\n327\n00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.940\nI've got my template that now has all\nthe settings that I want to deploy\n\n328\n00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.870\nin a group policy option, but the person\nwho made the template can't create GPM.\n\n329\n00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.390\nSo they make the template.\n\n330\n00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:51.160\nThey let me know when they're done.\n\n331\n00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.688\nWhat would then would happen is\nI'm gonna take that template.\n\n332\n00:17:58.114 --> 00:17:58.810\nAll right.\n\n333\n00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:00.920\nAnd I'm gonna copy it.\n\n334\n00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:06.540\nAnd I think I've still got a share over\nthere on DC01, I got that data share.\n\n335\n00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.446\nI'm gonna paste it over there on a DC01.\n\n336\n00:18:08.446 --> 00:18:13.723\nSo any way that I could get it,\nI could email it to whomever was making\n\n337\n00:18:13.723 --> 00:18:19.647\nthose GPOs, and now when we go over to\nDC1, we're gonna make a new policy,\n\n338\n00:18:19.647 --> 00:18:25.620\nwe're gonna apply those settings\nto all of my client computers.\n\n339\n00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:30.620\nSo I'm simply gonna make a new GPO and\nthen call it security.\n\n340\n00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:32.320\nSettings.\n\n341\n00:18:35.125 --> 00:18:35.880\nI'll click OK.\n\n342\n00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.696\nAnd then I'll edit that GPO.\n\n343\n00:18:44.482 --> 00:18:49.729\nAnd then I'm gonna go down\nto my Windows settings and\n\n344\n00:18:49.729 --> 00:18:56.660\nthen security settings I'm going\nto right click and import policy.\n\n345\n00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:00.570\nI'll go find that template and\nI put it on that data folder.\n\n346\n00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.630\nSo, we'll move back out here.\n\n347\n00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.830\nAnd where did I put that guy?\n\n348\n00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:07.460\nThere's data and there's my template.\n\n349\n00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:10.060\nAnd so, I chose it.\n\n350\n00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.220\nNow, I'm gonna close this guy.\n\n351\n00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:14.963\nAnd let's take a look at the settings.\n\n352\n00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.936\nWhereas I've got my password settings,\nnow remember,\n\n353\n00:19:20.936 --> 00:19:24.340\npassword settings are only in\neffect at the domain level.\n\n354\n00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.160\nI'm just doing this as an example.\n\n355\n00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.660\nBut there's the settings\nfrom that template.\n\n356\n00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.780\nThere's my restricted\ngroup from that template.\n\n357\n00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:36.060\nSo now you see that I can have one person\ngo through the trouble of testing these\n\n358\n00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.780\nsettings, configuring machine,\ncreating that template, and\n\n359\n00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.110\nthen when they're all tested everything\nis goo, ,we know it's how we want it,\n\n360\n00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.790\nI can just take that template,\ngive it to whomever is responsible for\n\n361\n00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:49.300\ncreating the GPOs,\nthey just create a new GPO or\n\n362\n00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:53.065\nan existing GPO right, it doesn't have to\nbe a brand new one I can go to any GPO,\n\n363\n00:19:53.065 --> 00:19:56.410\nright-click on Security Settings,\nImport template.\n\n364\n00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:59.200\nFind that template, and\nit brings those settings in.\n\n365\n00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.400\nIt's that easy.\n\n366\n00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.670\n>> Mike it really does sound like a great\nway for us to really distribute some\n\n367\n00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:07.370\nof the workload when we may have different\ndepartments that need different security\n\n368\n00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:11.370\nsettings, and we can be able to assign\nthat task, have them create the template,\n\n369\n00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.030\nand then we can import them in and\nput them where we want to, right?\n\n370\n00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:14.710\n>> Absolutely.\n\n371\n00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:15.670\nAnd it's re-usable.\n\n372\n00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.830\nThat template is still sitting there,\nright?\n\n373\n00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:21.430\nSo if tomorrow I need those same\nsettings in a different GPO,\n\n374\n00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.070\nthat wouldn't make much sense,\nbut just for example.\n\n375\n00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:27.000\nI could go down to this GPO,\nI could choose Edit.\n\n376\n00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.008\nI could come in here to Policies and\nthen Window Settings.\n\n377\n00:20:31.008 --> 00:20:35.566\nAnd then right-click on my\nSecurity Settings, Import,\n\n378\n00:20:35.566 --> 00:20:38.550\ngrab it, and I'm good to go, right?\n\n379\n00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:43.770\nAnd now those settings\nare configured in this GPO.\n\n380\n00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.850\nAgain, not the best example cuz\nI can't do password settings\n\n381\n00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:48.470\nanywhere other than at the domain level.\n\n382\n00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:52.810\nBut just to give you an idea again of\nwhat you can do with those templates.\n\n383\n00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:58.130\nIt's that portability that I get from\nthose, that subset of security settings.\n\n384\n00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:01.880\nAnd the ability to delegate,\nlet other people do part of the job.\n\n385\n00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.920\nMike, let me ask about a best practice\nhere then since we've got a little bit\n\n386\n00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.170\nof time to talk.\n\n387\n00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:10.290\nSo we've talked about in group\npolicy before a lot of times where\n\n388\n00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:14.230\nwhat we would normally do is we don't want\nto pile everything up into one policy.\n\n389\n00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:17.280\nIt'd be better to actually\nkind of separate them policies\n\n390\n00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.380\nWhat about security templates as well?\n\n391\n00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:23.010\nIs it better to make just individual\nlittle settings that make multiple\n\n392\n00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:23.736\npolicies, or\n\n393\n00:21:23.736 --> 00:21:26.712\nshould we combine them up and-\n>> You can definitely do them\n\n394\n00:21:26.712 --> 00:21:27.610\nindividually.\n\n395\n00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:31.385\nYou might have one person that is working\nwith those restricted groups, and\n\n396\n00:21:31.385 --> 00:21:32.475\nyou've gotta do several.\n\n397\n00:21:32.475 --> 00:21:35.595\nAnd so they take a template and\nthey do nothing but\n\n398\n00:21:35.595 --> 00:21:37.835\nrestricted group settings\nin that template.\n\n399\n00:21:37.835 --> 00:21:41.093\nAnd then you got another\nperson that does nothing but\n\n400\n00:21:41.093 --> 00:21:46.075\nfile settings in that template or what\nhave you, some other security settings.\n\n401\n00:21:46.075 --> 00:21:47.995\nYou can import more than one template.\n\n402\n00:21:47.995 --> 00:21:52.320\nIf we went over here,\nlet's go back over here to my console, and\n\n403\n00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.870\nlets make a new template, and\n\n404\n00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.337\nI'm gonna call this one test because\nI am not feeling all that creative.\n\n405\n00:21:58.337 --> 00:22:00.408\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> And then we are gonna go into here and\n\n406\n00:22:00.408 --> 00:22:02.338\nlets go down to System Services, and\n\n407\n00:22:02.338 --> 00:22:06.528\nmaybe I've got one person that their\nresponsibility is to work with services.\n\n408\n00:22:06.528 --> 00:22:09.557\nThey know which one needs to be\nrunning,which ones shouldn't be running,\n\n409\n00:22:09.557 --> 00:22:11.820\nwhich ones should be automatic, exedrae.\n\n410\n00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.440\nSo their template, even though it\nhas all these settings available,\n\n411\n00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.050\nthe only thing they're\nconfiguring are services.\n\n412\n00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.020\nSo they go through and\nthey set some different service and\n\n413\n00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.650\nthey're start up type.\n\n414\n00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.720\nLet's see what's another good one to do,\nlet's do, no.\n\n415\n00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:30.810\nGood enough for now.\n\n416\n00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:33.195\nOh, that principal one, I want to\nmake sure that's not running, right?\n\n417\n00:22:33.195 --> 00:22:36.330\n[LAUGH] All right, so\n\n418\n00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:41.340\nand then they save this, so we'll\nright click on it and choose Save, and\n\n419\n00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:47.620\nthen we'll copy that out to that\nshared location, so go into my, oops,\n\n420\n00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:53.580\nwe'll go into My Documents\n> Security templates.\n\n421\n00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.660\nAnd then we'll grab that guy.\n\n422\n00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.110\nAnd copy it.\n\n423\n00:22:56.110 --> 00:23:02.397\nAnd then we'll put it over on\nthat share again, DCO1/data.\n\n424\n00:23:02.397 --> 00:23:08.730\nOops, and Mike is having trouble typing.\n\n425\n00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:10.350\nAnd we'll paste that guy in there.\n\n426\n00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:16.755\nAnd so now we're gonna go to that GPO that\nI've already imported one template to.\n\n427\n00:23:21.093 --> 00:23:24.340\nSecurity Settings here.\n\n428\n00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:28.830\nAnd I'm gonna right click Edit and\nI'm gonna go to Policies and\n\n429\n00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.750\nWindows Settings I'm gonna right\nclick on security settings,\n\n430\n00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:35.810\nimport policy, test, and open.\n\n431\n00:23:36.958 --> 00:23:39.850\nAnd now if we close it, and\nwe take a look at our settings.\n\n432\n00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.370\nWe're gonna see that the settings from\nthe first import are still there.\n\n433\n00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.790\nRestricted groups,\nas well as the settings that I just did.\n\n434\n00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:51.128\nHere's my principal service settings,\nand my application identity.\n\n435\n00:23:51.128 --> 00:23:56.122\nSo you could definitely have situation\nwhere you have multiple templates\n\n436\n00:23:56.122 --> 00:23:59.430\nthat you end up importing\ninto the same GPO.\n\n437\n00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:00.830\nSo, to answer your question then,\n\n438\n00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:04.910\nI think it's great having templates for\none specific purpose, right?\n\n439\n00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.250\nBecause if I put everything\nin one template,\n\n440\n00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:10.380\nwhat if I want to use some of those\nsettings here, but not all of them.\n\n441\n00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.600\nI can't import half the template.\n\n442\n00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.990\nBut if this template only includes\nmy restricted group settings and\n\n443\n00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:19.500\nthis template only includes\nmy service settings and\n\n444\n00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.270\nthis template only includes\nthose file settings.\n\n445\n00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:26.500\nWell now I can choose to use all three\nof them or I can use just two of them or\n\n446\n00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:27.030\njust one of them.\n\n447\n00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:28.200\nSee what I'm saying?\n\n448\n00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.070\nSo I think you get\na little more flexibility\n\n449\n00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.570\nby keeping the settings\nin separate templates.\n\n450\n00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.910\nSo it really depends on what your needs\nare, but I like separate templates.\n\n451\n00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:42.070\n>> Now Mike, I was just trying to\nthink back at the application settings\n\n452\n00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:46.390\nthat we talked about also with group\npolicy, about the and the OU and\n\n453\n00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:48.680\nthe domain settings as well.\n\n454\n00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.820\nWith the security templates, it should\nstill apply in that same way where we\n\n455\n00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.100\nstill have the same orders, right?\n\n456\n00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.590\n>> Yup, because you're really not\napplying the template You're just\n\n457\n00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:00.080\nusing the template as a way to\nconfigure the settings in the GPO.\n\n458\n00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.220\nOnce you've imported those\ntemplate settings into the GPO,\n\n459\n00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.730\nthe template doesn't matter, right.\n\n460\n00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:08.390\nIt's the GPO that's being applied to\nthe site, to the domain, or the OU.\n\n461\n00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:12.200\nThe template is just a way to\nconfigure multiple settings.\n\n462\n00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.790\nBy right clicking and choosing import\ninstead of having to dive down in and\n\n463\n00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:17.920\nactually double click on\neach individual setting.\n\n464\n00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.480\nSo it really doesn't matter\nabout the template itself.\n\n465\n00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.648\n>> Of course I have one\nmore question then.\n\n466\n00:25:22.648 --> 00:25:23.675\n>> Of course.\n\n467\n00:25:23.675 --> 00:25:26.010\n>> As Mike keeps talking,\nI keep thinking of more questions.\n\n468\n00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:27.230\nSo, it's a great time to ask.\n\n469\n00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.177\nMike, let's say for an example,\nI create a security template,\n\n470\n00:25:30.177 --> 00:25:31.688\nyou create a security template.\n\n471\n00:25:31.688 --> 00:25:36.520\nAnd I accidentally go in and\nI change for the password.\n\n472\n00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.760\nAnd then you also change that as well.\n\n473\n00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.070\nIs it the last one that got applied\nthat takes precedent I'm assuming?\n\n474\n00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.681\n>> It is.\n\n475\n00:25:42.681 --> 00:25:43.946\n>> Okay.\n>> Because of the way again,\n\n476\n00:25:43.946 --> 00:25:45.165\nbecause of the way it's importing.\n\n477\n00:25:45.165 --> 00:25:48.910\nYou're just taking this template and\napplying it to the GPO.\n\n478\n00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:51.580\nAnd once you do that the template\nis neither here nor there, right?\n\n479\n00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.757\nIt's a GPO with settings in it.\n\n480\n00:25:53.757 --> 00:25:55.480\nSo if I apply another template and\n\n481\n00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.048\nit has a setting that was already\nconfigured from the first template I\n\n482\n00:25:59.048 --> 00:26:03.980\nimported it's just going to override that\nsetting with whatever I'm importing now.\n\n483\n00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.100\nIf there was a setting that was\nconfigured in the first one but\n\n484\n00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:10.150\nwasn't configured in the second one, it's\na cumulative effect like you saw there,\n\n485\n00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.550\nthe restrictive groups,\nas well as the service start up types, but\n\n486\n00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:18.220\nif I had a third template that set\nthat application identity to disabled.\n\n487\n00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:22.570\nEven though the first template I imported\nset the application identity to automatic,\n\n488\n00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:26.430\nI import that next template and it's gonna\nchange it from automatic to disabled.\n\n489\n00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:28.730\nSo it definitely is\nthe last one you import,\n\n490\n00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:30.820\nis gonna be the settings that stay.\n\n491\n00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.560\n>> Well I'm glad you knew the answers to\nall of those because I've just kept coming\n\n492\n00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.860\nup with different questions.\n\n493\n00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:35.990\n>> Good questions.\n\n494\n00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.570\nSo Mike,\n\n495\n00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:41.660\nsecurity templates look like it's really a\ngreat way to be able to do what you said.\n\n496\n00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.950\nAssign that responsibility\nto somebody else.\n\n497\n00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:46.880\nYou just import them in to the Active\nDirectory since you're the one that\n\n498\n00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.780\nhas control over it.\n\n499\n00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.780\nYou don't actually have to give anybody\nany more privileges than they need to.\n\n500\n00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:52.470\nIt can be a big help to you.\n\n501\n00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:56.070\nAnd that actually allows us to go apply\nthose policies the way that we want to.\n\n502\n00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.350\nSo Mike, any last words here.\n\n503\n00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:01.170\nAny secret sauce to security\ntemplates we gotta worry about.\n\n504\n00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:05.410\n>> No, other than the fact that now I've\ngot time to play some Minesweeper while\n\n505\n00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:07.900\neveryone else works on\nthe security settings.\n\n506\n00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.380\nThat's really what it's about.\n\n507\n00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.010\nBeing able to delegate,\nnot that I'm playing Minesweeper.\n\n508\n00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:16.500\nI've got servers to maintain, so if I can\ntake a part of my job and I can delegate\n\n509\n00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:20.790\nthat to somebody and let that be their\nprimary focus, it's a wonderful thing.\n\n510\n00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:21.930\n>> Awesome, Mike.\n\n511\n00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:23.540\nAll right, well that's a great place for\n\n512\n00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.330\nus to actually take a look at\nthose security templates again,\n\n513\n00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:29.200\nso take a look if you haven't\nactually been playing with them.\n\n514\n00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.674\nDo a test lab, make sure you actually\nget to understand a little bit better,\n\n515\n00:27:32.674 --> 00:27:36.254\nthat's a good place for us to go and\nIn this episode, signing off for ITProTV,\n\n516\n00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:37.143\nI'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n517\n00:27:37.143 --> 00:27:38.124\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n518\n00:27:38.124 --> 00:27:39.244\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n519\n00:27:39.244 --> 00:27:43.800\n[SOUND]\n\n",
