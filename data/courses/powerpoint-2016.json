Well, in this episode what we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna start from the very\n\n17\n00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.930\nbeginning, the really beginning,\nbeginning.\n\n18\n00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.880\nOf where we're just gonna start\ntalking about PowerPoint.\n\n19\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.420\nWhat is it, what does it do?\n\n20\n00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.280\nAnd just kind of,\nhow do we even get it started?\n\n21\n00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.620\nHow do we even launch the program?\n\n22\n00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.246\nSo I made a PowerPoint to\ntalk about PowerPoint.\n\n23\n00:01:02.246 --> 00:01:03.082\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n24\n00:01:03.082 --> 00:01:06.415\nI'm gonna just jump right in and\nget going.\n\n25\n00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:07.375\nWhat is PowerPoint?\n\n26\n00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:08.575\nSo here is the introduction.\n\n27\n00:01:08.575 --> 00:01:13.685\nSo PowerPoint is\na presentation application.\n\n28\n00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:17.895\nIt is the product that you\nuse to create slides, and\n\n29\n00:01:17.895 --> 00:01:22.675\nwhen you run your slides,\nit becomes a slideshow.\n\n30\n00:01:22.675 --> 00:01:26.210\nAnd you can see that I put up in\nthat first bullet point there that\n\n31\n00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.180\nI said it's a presentation application.\n\n32\n00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.290\nBut you could also use the word software,\n\n33\n00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.540\nyou could use the word program,\napplication.\n\n34\n00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.134\nThose words are really interchangeable,\nand a lot of people use them when they're\n\n35\n00:01:37.134 --> 00:01:43.300\ndescribing any type of product,\nsoftware application, program.\n\n36\n00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.570\nPowerPoint, Word, Excel,\nanything within Office,\n\n37\n00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.300\nyou can kinda use those\nwords interchangeably.\n\n38\n00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.893\nSo I wanted to go ahead and\njust throw that in there right there.\n\n39\n00:01:49.893 --> 00:01:53.791\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, when in the world\nwould I normally need PowerPoint?\n\n40\n00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:57.540\nI know, let's say for example,\nthat my daughter when she was in school,\n\n41\n00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.850\nshe used PowerPoint to\nmake a presentation.\n\n42\n00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.230\nBut I'm an adult,\n\n43\n00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.130\nI'm working at an office, when in\nthe world would I ever use PowerPoint?\n\n44\n00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.906\n&gt;&gt; All the time.\n[LAUGH]\n\n45\n00:02:05.906 --> 00:02:06.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n46\n00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.930\n&gt;&gt; I mean if you work in an office,\nlike right now I'm giving a presentation\n\n47\n00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.346\non PowerPoint, on a subject that I would\nlike to give you some information about.\n\n48\n00:02:16.346 --> 00:02:19.960\nAnd I'm going to be standing up and\ntalking to people, PowerPoint is a great\n\n49\n00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.645\ntool to help you convey that information\nwith graphics and some words.\n\n50\n00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.800\nThen of course one of the biggest things,\n\n51\n00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.837\nyou don't wanna just read\ndirectly from your slides.\n\n52\n00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:35.270\nWe will have a whole episode on going\nover what makes a PowerPoint presentation\n\n53\n00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.710\neffective, and making sure you're\ncreating a good PowerPoint presentation.\n\n54\n00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.210\nBut It could be used for anything.\n\n55\n00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.880\nYou think about teachers\nusing it in a classroom.\n\n56\n00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.340\nA church, a lot of churches use\nPowerPoints to convey or bring a message.\n\n57\n00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.750\nAnything really,\nstudents use it to do presentations.\n\n58\n00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.240\nIt's all over the place.\n\n59\n00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Vonne,\nI see the advantage of that.\n\n60\n00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.580\nBecause a lot of times\nwhen I went to school,\n\n61\n00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.910\nPowerPoint really wasn't\na big product at that point.\n\n62\n00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.190\nIt was all about handing in papers and\njust turning in papers.\n\n63\n00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.730\nOr being able to do a little bit of\na public speech in front of people.\n\n64\n00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.940\nBut the idea of PowerPoint,\nI think, what makes it nice and\n\n65\n00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.160\npowerful is what you talked about.\n\n66\n00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.050\nIt allows us to draw together media\nas well as the words that we want\n\n67\n00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.060\nto really help make the point\nthat we want to as well.\n\n68\n00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.800\nAll right, so Vonne,\nwhere can we get started?\n\n69\n00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.950\nHow can I get PowerPoint on my computer?\n\n70\n00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.892\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so next slide.\n\n71\n00:03:26.892 --> 00:03:28.401\n[LAUGH] Let me jump down into here.\n\n72\n00:03:28.401 --> 00:03:36.930\nSo PowerPoint is a product within\nthe Office 365 suite of applications.\n\n73\n00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:37.560\nAnd you can see,\n\n74\n00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.020\nI have this slide here where I just\nkind of threw all of the different\n\n75\n00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.860\nOffice products that you will be able to\nsee if you go to the Microsoft website.\n\n76\n00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.500\nSo I put the ones on\nthe left that we have Word,\n\n77\n00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.840\nExcel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Access.\n\n78\n00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.505\nCuz these are the ones that a lot of\npeople kinda typically find within\n\n79\n00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:57.765\nan Office product.\n\n80\n00:03:57.765 --> 00:04:00.715\nAnd there's another side in just a second\nthat talks about all the different\n\n81\n00:04:00.715 --> 00:04:01.935\nversions that you can get.\n\n82\n00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:04.506\nBut I went ahead and\nput some other ones on there,\n\n83\n00:04:04.506 --> 00:04:08.281\nbecause OneNote is a product that you\nactually will see a lot nowadays.\n\n84\n00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:11.731\nYou'll probably actually see that more\nthan Access sometimes when you're buying\n\n85\n00:04:11.731 --> 00:04:15.360\nthese bundles or these different suites\nof application that you wanna get.\n\n86\n00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.392\nAnd some other kinda outliers, if you\nwanna see, Project, Visio, Publisher, and\n\n87\n00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:22.370\nInfoPath those are once that\nyou'll be seeing here and there.\n\n88\n00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.911\nAnd I put off to the very,\nvery right Sway, Teams, SharePoint, Lync,\n\n89\n00:04:26.911 --> 00:04:30.050\nwhich is really Skype for\nBusiness and OneDrive.\n\n90\n00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.034\nI'm just throwing it on this slide so\n\n91\n00:04:32.034 --> 00:04:36.386\nyou will be able to recognize these things\nwhen you go to the Microsoft website and\n\n92\n00:04:36.386 --> 00:04:38.826\nbe able to see all of\nthese different things.\n\n93\n00:04:38.826 --> 00:04:43.897\nSo you're going to have to determine\nwhat product is best for you.\n\n94\n00:04:43.897 --> 00:04:45.385\nAnd so you can see that they,\n\n95\n00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:49.160\non this I actually just took\na screenshot of the Microsoft website.\n\n96\n00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.070\nThere are a bunch of different pans.\n\n97\n00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.440\nYou have like, your personal use,\nyou have office use, for business,\n\n98\n00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.646\nyou have for it education, so you get\nthe student pricing a lot of times.\n\n99\n00:04:58.646 --> 00:05:02.820\nAnd that's just for,\nif you are purchasing it yourself.\n\n100\n00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.070\nBecause if you have a large organization,\n\n101\n00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.300\nthen you have IT people that are going\nto be purchasing these products for you.\n\n102\n00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.190\nAnd so that's something that\nyou'll just have to talk to\n\n103\n00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.230\nwhoever is in charge of your IT, no matter\nhow large or small your organization is.\n\n104\n00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.300\nAnd how they're going to be Installing or\n\n105\n00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.010\nhaving the products on whatever\ncomputer that you're using.\n\n106\n00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.720\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne,\nyou made a key word point for\n\n107\n00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.830\nme, which is the idea that\nI can get this for free.\n\n108\n00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.750\nHow is that possible?\n\n109\n00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.830\n&gt;&gt; That's a great point, Ronnie.\n\n110\n00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.000\nBecause yes, you can actually\nget these products for free.\n\n111\n00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.820\nSo actually I have another slide\nthat's supposed to get into that.\n\n112\n00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.640\nSo you have PowerPoint, and you can have\nit locally installed on your computer.\n\n113\n00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.840\nSo you bought one of those plans, and\nyou've actually purchased this product.\n\n114\n00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.150\nYou can install it on the machine and\nhave it just like you'd have\n\n115\n00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.890\nany other product on your machine,\nso that was a local install.\n\n116\n00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.284\nWhen you actually do that, you’re actually\nbringing that up to, it's PowerPoint 2016.\n\n117\n00:06:02.284 --> 00:06:06.737\nSo yeah, we have PowerPoint 365, or\nOffice 365, but then when it’s your\n\n118\n00:06:06.737 --> 00:06:11.192\nmachine its PowerPoint 2016, yes that’s\nexactly what its supposed to be.\n\n119\n00:06:11.192 --> 00:06:15.510\nBut on the other side, one of\nthe kinda nice features about Office\n\n120\n00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.199\n365 is that you can use all\nof these same products, or\n\n121\n00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.460\nsoftware, or programs or\nwhatever you wanna call it, online.\n\n122\n00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.420\nSo you can use it through\nyour web browser, and\n\n123\n00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.990\nthat's the part where you can\naccess these products or free.\n\n124\n00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.750\nAll you have to do is sign up for\na Microsoft account, and\n\n125\n00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.880\nyou create a online account.\n\n126\n00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.473\nAnd then you can use the free versions\nof PowerPoint, Word, Excel, and\n\n127\n00:06:40.473 --> 00:06:43.579\nI believe your mail comes\nthrough there as well.\n\n128\n00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:47.805\nSo you can use all of those kind of like\nthe big products we'll call them, for\n\n129\n00:06:47.805 --> 00:06:50.924\nfree by just signing up for\nthe Microsoft application.\n\n130\n00:06:50.924 --> 00:06:54.485\nSo whether you're using a free version,\na paid version,\n\n131\n00:06:54.485 --> 00:06:57.248\nwhether you're doing it locally or online,\n\n132\n00:06:57.248 --> 00:07:02.070\nthat does make a difference, because\nthere will be some slight differences.\n\n133\n00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.312\nWell, a lot of the, adding a slide,\nand running a show, that's going to\n\n134\n00:07:06.312 --> 00:07:11.090\nbe the same across all of your products,\nwhether you're on a PC or on a Mac.\n\n135\n00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:16.080\nBut it is something that you definitely\nshould take note of when you're\n\n136\n00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.570\nusing your PowerPoint and\nwatching these episodes, so.\n\n137\n00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Vonne, that makes a very good\npoint here that the very fact that,\n\n138\n00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:23.690\nif we do get it for free,\n\n139\n00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.760\nwe might find some limitations of\nwhat we might show here on the show.\n\n140\n00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.290\nBut at the same time,\nit's enough to get somebody started,\n\n141\n00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.700\nto be able to work with\nPowerPoint right away.\n\n142\n00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.780\nAnd Vonne mentioned those\ndifferent plans and\n\n143\n00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.050\nit really does boil down to whether\nyour company is purchasing it,\n\n144\n00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.430\nwhether you're purchasing it, or whether\nyou're just trying to use it at all.\n\n145\n00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.760\nWhich ones you'll actually end up with.\n\n146\n00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.910\nMost companies will of\ncourse end up paying for it.\n\n147\n00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.750\nBut if you're on your own and you're\ngoing man, I really can't afford it,\n\n148\n00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.310\nyou can just connect online and\n\n149\n00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.748\nbe able to use it without having to\nreally pay that much for it at all.\n\n150\n00:07:54.748 --> 00:07:58.292\nFree is kind of the key and\noperative word which is also nice too.\n\n151\n00:07:58.292 --> 00:08:02.967\nNow, Vonne, as we started using these\nwe're gonna end up creating PowerPoint\n\n152\n00:08:02.967 --> 00:08:06.121\nfiles, I'm assuming is\nwhat we're gonna created.\n\n153\n00:08:06.121 --> 00:08:09.991\nAnd I've noticed something over time\nis that these files have changed.\n\n154\n00:08:09.991 --> 00:08:12.660\nWhat are we talking about when we take\na look at this idea of the change?\n\n155\n00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.460\n&gt;&gt; You have a great transition for\nme there, Ronnie.\n\n156\n00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:18.803\nSo onto the next slide, you can see\nthat we have version and file types.\n\n157\n00:08:18.803 --> 00:08:23.238\nBecause just like Ronnie was saying,\nwhen we're creating\n\n158\n00:08:23.238 --> 00:08:28.124\na PowerPoint presentation,\nwe are creating a PPTX file format.\n\n159\n00:08:28.124 --> 00:08:30.980\nSo that's just PowerPoint, that ppt.\n\n160\n00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.301\nSo you can actually see it\nreferred a lot to as ppt.\n\n161\n00:08:34.301 --> 00:08:37.663\nBut it has that x, because there's been\nmany different versions of PowerPoint\n\n162\n00:08:37.663 --> 00:08:38.673\nthroughout the years.\n\n163\n00:08:38.673 --> 00:08:43.932\nI actually found a note that it was\noriginally created for Mac in 1987.\n\n164\n00:08:43.932 --> 00:08:47.360\nSo that was actually conceptualized, and\n\n165\n00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.510\nits gone through the different versions,\nboth in the PC versions and\n\n166\n00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.460\nthe Mac versions, and they have\nthe years of which they came out.\n\n167\n00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:00.086\nSo you could see that the .pptx\nfile format has been around ever\n\n168\n00:09:00.086 --> 00:09:01.927\nsince Office 2007.\n\n169\n00:09:01.927 --> 00:09:05.772\nThere was a huge jump from, and\nactually, it's right behind my head, but\n\n170\n00:09:05.772 --> 00:09:09.206\nthere was 2003 to 2007 there\nwas a pretty big split there.\n\n171\n00:09:09.206 --> 00:09:12.496\nBecause I think before that,\nthey were doing 2000, 2002, 2003.\n\n172\n00:09:12.496 --> 00:09:16.158\nSo there was quite a few versions but\nbig gap, and\n\n173\n00:09:16.158 --> 00:09:21.710\nthey jumped right into an extended\nversion of all of the Office products.\n\n174\n00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.230\nAnd that's why if you think extended,\nyou got an x at the end.\n\n175\n00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.670\nI mean, that's how I always thought of it.\n\n176\n00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.290\nI don't really know if that's\ntheir logic behind it, but\n\n177\n00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:33.830\nit did extend all of the file formats and\nall of the Office products.\n\n178\n00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:39.276\nSo doc was for Word and\nbecame docx, ppt became pptx.\n\n179\n00:09:39.276 --> 00:09:43.701\nAnd it's just a good thing to point out,\nbecause while we're in,\n\n180\n00:09:43.701 --> 00:09:45.608\nthis is 2017 right now.\n\n181\n00:09:45.608 --> 00:09:51.179\nYou could have files that are in\nan older version from those 2003 days\n\n182\n00:09:51.179 --> 00:09:57.130\nthat is in a ppt extension, and that's\njust at least something to point out.\n\n183\n00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.400\nAnd I put all the icons on there, so\nyou can get a little idea about it.\n\n184\n00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.682\nAnd a big thing down below there,\nyou can see compatibility mode.\n\n185\n00:10:03.682 --> 00:10:07.380\nI put that in there,\nbecause that's where in the title bar,\n\n186\n00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.063\nwhen we get into actually the environment,\n\n187\n00:10:10.063 --> 00:10:14.721\nthe title bar will actually have\ncompatibility mode right there at the top.\n\n188\n00:10:14.721 --> 00:10:16.788\nAnd that's a big indication to you that,\n\n189\n00:10:16.788 --> 00:10:20.570\nthat is the file format that\nyou're going to be working in.\n\n190\n00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.880\n&gt;&gt; Yvonne, I think there's also\nanother important aspect of this, too,\n\n191\n00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.940\nwhich we may not think about right away.\n\n192\n00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.580\nBut I know that what's happened\nto me in the past, and\n\n193\n00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.220\nI feign a little bit of ignorance\nabout getting started here.\n\n194\n00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.540\nBut overall, though,\nwhen somebody's handing me a PowerPoint,\n\n195\n00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:39.560\nI may wonder what particular file\nwill actually open in PowerPoint.\n\n196\n00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.080\nThese extensions essentially tell us that,\nhey,\n\n197\n00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.500\nwe can use PowerPoint to help\nus to open those types of files.\n\n198\n00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.550\nAnd the neat thing in whatever version of\nOffice that you're using on your computer,\n\n199\n00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.620\nif it's a Windows computer,\nit will turn that icon,\n\n200\n00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.520\nand the ones that showed us\nright there on the screen.\n\n201\n00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.380\nSo that way you can go,\nthat's gonna open up in PowerPoint.\n\n202\n00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.320\nSo it really does help.\n\n203\n00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.184\nAnd the other neat thing about the newer\nversion is that it will still accept that\n\n204\n00:11:04.184 --> 00:11:06.592\nolder one that you were talking about.\n\n205\n00:11:06.592 --> 00:11:10.530\nSo if you are ever unsure the newer\nversions will open up those older versions\n\n206\n00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:11.360\nas well.\n\n207\n00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:17.200\nYou may lose some compatibility sometimes\ndepending on what was built in 2003.\n\n208\n00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.159\nIt may not come over in 2017 or\n2016 now but overall though,\n\n209\n00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:25.117\nthese file types are really helpful\nwhen you're not sure whether or\n\n210\n00:11:25.117 --> 00:11:27.970\nnot your program is gonna open this up.\n\n211\n00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.350\nSo Yvonne,\nwhich version are we gonna work with?\n\n212\n00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:34.180\nYou talk about Office 365, you talked\nabout locally installed, the free version.\n\n213\n00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.300\nWhich one are we're\ngonna end up using here?\n\n214\n00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:41.000\n&gt;&gt; So what we're using here for\nour episodes is I have\n\n215\n00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.340\nOffice 365 ProPlus\ninstalled on my machine.\n\n216\n00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.760\nAnd it is going to be a local install, so\n\n217\n00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.640\nit will show up as PowerPoint 2016,\nso you'll see that.\n\n218\n00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.750\nAnd I am on a Windows 10\nProfessional with 64 bit processing.\n\n219\n00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:01.170\nSo I just wanted to throw that in\nthere because It's always good to know\n\n220\n00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:01.870\nabout that.\n\n221\n00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.380\nAnd since we are on Windows,\n\n222\n00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:07.800\nI did wanna just point out one thing\nabout those file extensions right.\n\n223\n00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.800\nBecause maybe you're like\nI don't ever see the pptx,\n\n224\n00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.570\nI don't even know that that\nwas how it actually works.\n\n225\n00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:19.680\nYou can see on this slide is that I\nhave the different views that you can\n\n226\n00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.010\nuse within the Windows Windows Explorer.\n\n227\n00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.920\nSo you can see that the Default view,\nyou don't actually have the extensions.\n\n228\n00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.570\nBut in the Extensions options,\nyou can actually show that.\n\n229\n00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.970\nBut you can also see in the Details\ncolumn, you can see that the one,\n\n230\n00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:39.160\nright here that is right there.\n\n231\n00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.181\nYou see right there 2003, my circle\ndidn't really work very well there.\n\n232\n00:12:44.181 --> 00:12:48.005\nBut you can see that that's where it's\nindicating, and the little icons.\n\n233\n00:12:48.005 --> 00:12:49.475\nSee?\nRemember we talked about those?\n\n234\n00:12:49.475 --> 00:12:51.348\nThose are different too, so\n\n235\n00:12:51.348 --> 00:12:56.818\nthose visual cues as well as getting those\ndetails views in your Windows Explorer.\n\n236\n00:12:56.818 --> 00:13:01.768\nAnd if you don't know how to put the\nextensions on your file types, over here,\n\n237\n00:13:01.768 --> 00:13:06.115\nthis is in your File Explorer or,\nyeah File Explorer Options.\n\n238\n00:13:06.115 --> 00:13:07.595\nAnd there's a little check box.\n\n239\n00:13:07.595 --> 00:13:11.513\nIt's funny because we're saying show\nextensions, you have to Uncheck hide.\n\n240\n00:13:11.513 --> 00:13:12.810\nYou have to not hide.\n\n241\n00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:16.780\nIt's kind of a backwards way of doing it,\nbut I'll show you in just a second.\n\n242\n00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.490\nI'll demonstrate where you can\nactually find those options within\n\n243\n00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:24.340\nyour Window's machine, and\nthat way you can do that if you want to.\n\n244\n00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.340\nBut I would be careful about it.\n\n245\n00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:30.090\nIf you show the extensions,\nyou do have the option\n\n246\n00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:33.250\nof actually editing those extensions,\nlike when you change the file names.\n\n247\n00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.950\nSo just be very careful about that,\ndon't mess with those extensions.\n\n248\n00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.360\n&gt;&gt; I think that's a great point to make,\n\n249\n00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.440\ncuz sometimes messing with those\nextensions may make it where you\n\n250\n00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.560\ncan't open that file inside\nof that program anymore.\n\n251\n00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.689\nAnother thing that I wanted to mention,\nYvonne, is the selection,\n\n252\n00:13:49.689 --> 00:13:52.820\nwe talked about which version\nthat we're gonna be using.\n\n253\n00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.505\nI normally install a lot of programs.\n\n254\n00:13:54.505 --> 00:13:56.999\nYvonne, do you normally install\na lot of programs on your computer?\n\n255\n00:13:56.999 --> 00:13:58.310\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n256\n00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:01.960\n&gt;&gt; So the great thing is this,\nit's not that it takes a PhD for\n\n257\n00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.850\nus to install something like\nPowerPoint on our computers.\n\n258\n00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.790\nWe can install it and\nwe simply just kinda click on it and\n\n259\n00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:12.410\nfollow through and let it do whatever it\nneeds to, and it really does automatically\n\n260\n00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:15.780\ninstall which is actually a great thing,\nbut if you're in a business environment.\n\n261\n00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.304\nYou may actually sit down at\nthe computer at your side and\n\n262\n00:14:18.304 --> 00:14:20.986\nthen may already be on there so\ndon't worry if you've got,\n\n263\n00:14:20.986 --> 00:14:24.635\nI don't know what version that I have and\nYvonne is later on is probably gonna show\n\n264\n00:14:24.635 --> 00:14:27.330\nus how we can figure out\nwhich version that we have.\n\n265\n00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.840\nBut overall though, just kinda realize\nit's either gonna be installed on\n\n266\n00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.810\nthe computer and it's ready for\nus to use, or it might be something\n\n267\n00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:39.550\nthat we have to install depending on which\nparticular version that we ended up with.\n\n268\n00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.790\nFor example, if you have an Office\n365 subscription from your business,\n\n269\n00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:47.020\nyou might see that you just have to\nclick on a little link and it tells\n\n270\n00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.980\nyou to download this, and then follow the\ninstructions, and it starts to install.\n\n271\n00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.230\nAnd you should get it on your computer,\nand\n\n272\n00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.680\nit should be ready to use at that point,\nas well.\n\n273\n00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.400\nSo Yvonne, here it is.\n\n274\n00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.190\nYou've kinda told us the basics here.\n\n275\n00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.470\nAnything else we need to think about.\n\n276\n00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.670\nOut before we really kinda\nget started in some of\n\n277\n00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.190\nthe basic mechanics of\nworking with PowerPoint.\n\n278\n00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.650\n&gt;&gt; I think we're covering most everything,\nand I do like that you mentioned about\n\n279\n00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:15.260\nthe installation with that subscription\nbased format that Office has gone to.\n\n280\n00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.233\nIt's gotten a lot easier\nto install the products.\n\n281\n00:15:18.233 --> 00:15:23.175\nI think the last slide that I have in\nthis one section of what is PowerPoint\n\n282\n00:15:23.175 --> 00:15:28.040\nintroduction, is making sure\nwe've talked about your set up.\n\n283\n00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.350\nAnd one of the places that\nyou can find out what version\n\n284\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.580\nof Office that you're using\nif if you go into your File.\n\n285\n00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.630\nAnd our File menu,\nit's not really a menu anymore.\n\n286\n00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:37.450\nIt's called the backstage view.\n\n287\n00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:38.902\nYou'll see that in a little bit.\n\n288\n00:15:38.902 --> 00:15:42.180\nYou can go to the Account section and\nthen it'll actually tell you.\n\n289\n00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.015\nAnd like we covered earlier,\nit might look a little different, but\n\n290\n00:15:45.015 --> 00:15:46.568\nall the basics are gonna be the same.\n\n291\n00:15:46.568 --> 00:15:49.107\nAnd if you're on an Enterprise edition,\n\n292\n00:15:49.107 --> 00:15:54.410\nbecause in that screenshot that I showed\nyou, have like small business, education.\n\n293\n00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:55.382\nBut it didn't say anything\nabout Enterprise.\n\n294\n00:15:55.382 --> 00:15:59.959\nBut that's because you, as a regular\nconsumer, wouldn't really be looking for\n\n295\n00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.358\nEnterprise licencings of this software.\n\n296\n00:16:02.358 --> 00:16:03.982\nBut large organizations will.\n\n297\n00:16:03.982 --> 00:16:07.509\nAnd there are some Tiny\ndifferences throughout it, but\n\n298\n00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:11.874\nit gets into some of those outlying\nproducts, and we'll go over it.\n\n299\n00:16:11.874 --> 00:16:15.650\nThrough all of our Office series,\nit'll probably come up.\n\n300\n00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:20.760\nAnd then the other thing would be Mac\nversus PC, that's another big thing.\n\n301\n00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.702\nIf you're using a Mac,\n\n302\n00:16:21.702 --> 00:16:24.538\nyou can still do a lot of the things\nthat we're going to be doing in this.\n\n303\n00:16:24.538 --> 00:16:27.764\nBut there's a decent\namount of differences.\n\n304\n00:16:27.764 --> 00:16:28.505\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n305\n00:16:28.505 --> 00:16:33.381\n&gt;&gt; And if you're on 2013,\n2013 is almost like 2016,\n\n306\n00:16:33.381 --> 00:16:37.101\nso it's pretty much the exact same,\nin a sense.\n\n307\n00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:41.690\nSo you'll be fine with that,\nand so that's your set up.\n\n308\n00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.133\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Yvonne,\nhelp us out now, as we now have a good,\n\n309\n00:16:45.133 --> 00:16:48.199\nsolid understanding of,\nreally, the foundations.\n\n310\n00:16:48.199 --> 00:16:48.952\nAnd kind of neat,\n\n311\n00:16:48.952 --> 00:16:52.250\nyou showed us a PowerPoint to help\nus get started in PowerPoint here.\n\n312\n00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.610\nBut if I want to really\nbegin to get started,\n\n313\n00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:59.010\nwe really do need to start with\nsome just basic commands, right?\n\n314\n00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.190\nSo where are we going to get started,\nYvonne?\n\n315\n00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.500\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, we're going to stop this\nPowerPoint in just a little bit.\n\n316\n00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.170\nBut I did have a slide here that\njust shows all the basic commands,\n\n317\n00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.260\nbecause I always like to teach any product\n\n318\n00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.970\nfrom the same point of you've\nnever even done this before.\n\n319\n00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.810\nYou have no idea where does\nit even live on my computer.\n\n320\n00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:22.511\nSo we're gonna start PowerPoint, we're\ngonna go over the file basics, file open,\n\n321\n00:17:22.511 --> 00:17:25.135\nfile close, close a program,\nsave, save as.\n\n322\n00:17:25.135 --> 00:17:28.446\nAnd I threw in there cut, copy and paste,\nundo and redo because those are very,\n\n323\n00:17:28.446 --> 00:17:29.805\nvery important.\n\n324\n00:17:29.805 --> 00:17:31.982\nSo if you've done these types of things,\n\n325\n00:17:31.982 --> 00:17:35.419\nthen you're gonna be very familiar\nwith it in any other product.\n\n326\n00:17:35.419 --> 00:17:38.165\nIt's the same across, pretty much,\nall the Office products.\n\n327\n00:17:38.165 --> 00:17:43.732\nI did throw the shortcuts in there because\nI'm a big proponent of keyboard shortcuts,\n\n328\n00:17:43.732 --> 00:17:44.578\nI love them.\n\n329\n00:17:44.578 --> 00:17:48.889\nAnd so Office actually has really some\nreally good ones all listed out for you.\n\n330\n00:17:48.889 --> 00:17:51.412\nI mean, tons, and tons, and tons of them,\nso you can always use that.\n\n331\n00:17:51.412 --> 00:17:54.761\nSo I threw in some of those links there so\nyou could go ahead and find them on your\n\n332\n00:17:54.761 --> 00:17:57.389\nown, and start discovering your\nown keyboard shortcuts and\n\n333\n00:17:57.389 --> 00:17:59.161\nhow you can make things a little faster.\n\n334\n00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:02.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Yvonne, shortcuts,\neven though I don't know all of them,\n\n335\n00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.845\nI do realize that they really are\nadvantageous, especially when working in\n\n336\n00:18:06.845 --> 00:18:10.590\nan office where productivity is the key,\nbecause it is about that.\n\n337\n00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.980\nIt's about keeping your hands on\nthe keyboard, being a bit more efficient.\n\n338\n00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.071\nAnd so Yvonne will probably\nhelp us by pointing out those\n\n339\n00:18:17.071 --> 00:18:18.723\nshortcuts as we come to them.\n\n340\n00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:21.493\nAll right, so Yvonne, here it is,\nlet's take, for an example,\n\n341\n00:18:21.493 --> 00:18:24.580\nthat I am beginning from ground zero,\nlike you're saying.\n\n342\n00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.530\nWhat is the first thing that\nI need to know how to do?\n\n343\n00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.300\n&gt;&gt; Okay, perfect, so,\nwhat I've done is I've actually,\n\n344\n00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.850\nwhile you were talking,\nI closed out PowerPoint.\n\n345\n00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.731\nSo we decided to just,\nokay, let's just stop.\n\n346\n00:18:34.731 --> 00:18:38.250\nAnd let's start from I've turned\non my computer, all right?\n\n347\n00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.342\nSo here's my computer,\nI have it on, where do I go?\n\n348\n00:18:41.342 --> 00:18:43.280\nAll right, well,\nyou always go to the Start menu.\n\n349\n00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.280\nNow, the Start menu is in the bottom\ncorner, looks like a little window,\n\n350\n00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.640\nand you could always click on it.\n\n351\n00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.990\nAnd it will go ahead and\n\n352\n00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.610\nbring up the Start menu within\nyour Windows 10 environment.\n\n353\n00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:56.700\nNow, everything is in alphabetical order,\nif you didn't know.\n\n354\n00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.410\nBut it's like,\nI don't even know where to find it.\n\n355\n00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:03.230\nThis little help bar,\nthe best thing ever, I love this thing.\n\n356\n00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:07.503\nSo if you are looking for PowerPoint,\nif you just start typing P-O-W,\n\n357\n00:19:07.503 --> 00:19:11.859\nyou can see that it's gonna go ahead and\nbring up PowerPoint right there.\n\n358\n00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:15.080\nAnd you can go ahead and\njust click it and start it.\n\n359\n00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.830\nWhile I'm here,\nremember that whole show extensions thing?\n\n360\n00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.190\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I can actually type in show extension.\n\n361\n00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:25.110\nYou can see it's already found out that,\nyou're probably looking to show,\n\n362\n00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.340\nhide extensions within the control panel.\n\n363\n00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.380\nSo it gave me my options right there,\nand I can just go ahead and click on it.\n\n364\n00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.885\nAnd you can see that I've got that\nunchecked hide to go ahead and\n\n365\n00:19:33.885 --> 00:19:35.285\nshow those extensions.\n\n366\n00:19:35.285 --> 00:19:39.359\nSo you can do the same thing that I have\non my machine for yourself, all right?\n\n367\n00:19:39.359 --> 00:19:44.331\nSo either typing in the search or clicking\non the Start menu and finding PowerPoint,\n\n368\n00:19:44.331 --> 00:19:46.723\nand then going ahead and clicking on it.\n\n369\n00:19:46.723 --> 00:19:49.785\nAnd it goes ahead and launches PowerPoint.\n\n370\n00:19:49.785 --> 00:19:54.512\nSo here you are, here is PowerPoint,\nhere is the start screen.\n\n371\n00:19:54.512 --> 00:19:56.040\nWe'll call it the start screen, yeah.\n\n372\n00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.610\n[LAUGH] So you can see that\nover on the left-hand side,\n\n373\n00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:02.280\nit's going to be giving me\nsome recently accessed files.\n\n374\n00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.935\nYou can see what I've\nbeen working on lately.\n\n375\n00:20:03.935 --> 00:20:05.950\n[LAUGH] I was getting us\nstarted in PowerPoint.\n\n376\n00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:10.669\nOver here, you're going to have your\npremade templates that you can use.\n\n377\n00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:13.604\nThese are actually what\nwe're going to find later.\n\n378\n00:20:13.604 --> 00:20:18.100\nThese are themes that you can\napply to your presentations.\n\n379\n00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.513\nOver here on the right-hand side, you\ncan see that this is where I [LAUGH] am.\n\n380\n00:20:22.513 --> 00:20:28.949\nI am Justin Timberlake, [LAUGH] and\nwe are connected to our Microsoft account,\n\n381\n00:20:28.949 --> 00:20:32.960\ncuz I am on that Office 365 subscription.\n\n382\n00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.870\nSo that's what it's just showing me,\nand I don't have a picture.\n\n383\n00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:39.785\nI think, eventually, I'll put\na picture of a cat in there, so see,\n\n384\n00:20:39.785 --> 00:20:40.940\nboy bands and cats.\n\n385\n00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.854\nAll right, [LAUGH] so you could go ahead\nand go through these if you wanted to.\n\n386\n00:20:45.854 --> 00:20:48.941\nBut we're gonna go over\nhere to the left-hand side,\n\n387\n00:20:48.941 --> 00:20:51.341\nbecause if I were to open a presentation,\n\n388\n00:20:51.341 --> 00:20:56.027\nI want to open a file right from the start\nscreen cuz I don't wanna start a new one.\n\n389\n00:20:56.027 --> 00:20:58.175\nI already have one that I need.\n\n390\n00:20:58.175 --> 00:21:01.110\nYou can click on Open Other Presentations.\n\n391\n00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:02.110\nAnd when you click on this,\n\n392\n00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:06.050\nit actually is taking you to\nwhat's called the backstage view.\n\n393\n00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:09.033\nThis is really the file menu, okay,\nso back in the day when we actually\n\n394\n00:21:09.033 --> 00:21:11.580\nhad menus and everything like that,\nthis is the file menu.\n\n395\n00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:16.286\nSo you have things like file new,\nand I will say file open, file new,\n\n396\n00:21:16.286 --> 00:21:18.898\ncuz backstage open, that's weird.\n\n397\n00:21:18.898 --> 00:21:19.461\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n398\n00:21:19.461 --> 00:21:21.998\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH] so\nwe have our normal commands.\n\n399\n00:21:21.998 --> 00:21:25.790\nAnd since we told it that we wanted to\nopen a file, it's bringing us to Open.\n\n400\n00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:29.330\nAnd you can see it's gonna show\nyou the different locations that\n\n401\n00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.760\nyou could commonly open.\n\n402\n00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.710\nAnd because we are on a 365 subscription,\nI do have access to OneDrive.\n\n403\n00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:40.940\nOneDrive is your cloud storage\nthat you can access anywhere.\n\n404\n00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.668\nThere is something also\nknown as SharePoint,\n\n405\n00:21:42.668 --> 00:21:45.000\nbut we're not going to\nget into that right now.\n\n406\n00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.379\nAnd you can see that it\nhas the recents again.\n\n407\n00:21:47.379 --> 00:21:51.861\nAnd then on this PC, I don't know\nexactly where the file is, but\n\n408\n00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:54.273\nmaybe it's somewhere on this PC.\n\n409\n00:21:54.273 --> 00:21:57.420\nAnd it'll hopefully trigger my memory\nof where I can find out where that is.\n\n410\n00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.780\nAnd so you can go through your\ndocuments and everything.\n\n411\n00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:06.207\nBut I'm kinda old school, so\nI like the old file open dialog boxes.\n\n412\n00:22:06.207 --> 00:22:08.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if you just go to Browse,\n\n413\n00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:13.895\ndown at the bottom, it opens back up into\nthe view that I'm most familiar with,\n\n414\n00:22:13.895 --> 00:22:17.550\nsince I been working with this product for\na long time.\n\n415\n00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:18.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n416\n00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.870\n&gt;&gt; So this is just a familiar view to me,\n\n417\n00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.690\nso I like going here.\n\n418\n00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:27.590\nAnd then just like in any other product,\nyou can go to the different places,\n\n419\n00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:31.850\nlike on your Desktop, or\nThis PC, and so on and so forth,\n\n420\n00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:34.620\nand find the location of\nwhere your files are.\n\n421\n00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.350\nAnd then I know that it is on my desktop,\nso I'm gonna double-click on that so\n\n422\n00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.430\nI can go ahead and get into that.\n\n423\n00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:42.765\nI have a folder called PowerPoint,\nwhere I have my PowerPoint information.\n\n424\n00:22:42.765 --> 00:22:46.558\nAnd it has all of my different\nfiles that I want to find, so\n\n425\n00:22:46.558 --> 00:22:48.862\nwe're just going to play around.\n\n426\n00:22:48.862 --> 00:22:52.430\nLet's go with What is PowerPoint,\nbecause that's where we were.\n\n427\n00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.470\nAnd you can see the Powerpoint\npresentation that I was\n\n428\n00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.310\nrunning the slideshow for\nin the beginning is right here.\n\n429\n00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.071\nAnd I have opened my file, yay!\n\n430\n00:23:01.071 --> 00:23:07.210\n[LAUGH] So if I have opened the file,\nwell, then how do I close the file?\n\n431\n00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.668\nNow, if you're closing the file and\nnot the application or\n\n432\n00:23:11.668 --> 00:23:15.589\nthe program,\nif you go back over to the File tab, and\n\n433\n00:23:15.589 --> 00:23:19.984\nwe'll be going over the ribbon\nin a lot more detail later.\n\n434\n00:23:19.984 --> 00:23:22.865\nOkay, so that's bringing you\nback to the backstage view.\n\n435\n00:23:22.865 --> 00:23:25.833\nAnd you can go ahead and see right\nover there, on the left-hand side,\n\n436\n00:23:25.833 --> 00:23:27.410\nthere is an option for Close.\n\n437\n00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:30.600\nAnd when you click Close,\nthat will close your file.\n\n438\n00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.439\nNotice that the program\nis actually still open.\n\n439\n00:23:34.439 --> 00:23:37.595\nOkay, so\nif you wanna close the whole program down,\n\n440\n00:23:37.595 --> 00:23:41.702\nup in the upper right-hand corner,\nthe big red X, that's close.\n\n441\n00:23:41.702 --> 00:23:46.910\nYou can go ahead and close, and\nthen it closes down the whole program.\n\n442\n00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:51.262\nAnd so that's file open, file close,\nand closing the application.\n\n443\n00:23:51.262 --> 00:23:54.852\nOkay, well,\nwe need to get back in there, so\n\n444\n00:23:54.852 --> 00:23:58.731\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nstart PowerPoint again.\n\n445\n00:23:58.731 --> 00:24:02.629\nAnd I can go back to opening\nanother presentation.\n\n446\n00:24:02.629 --> 00:24:06.433\nI did wanna point out right here,\nwhen you're in the start screen,\n\n447\n00:24:06.433 --> 00:24:10.637\nIf you hit this little button right here,\nup in the upper left hand corner,\n\n448\n00:24:10.637 --> 00:24:13.600\nthat takes you back to the start screen.\n\n449\n00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.382\nWell, I'm gonna go and just go right\nto recent, because it's right there.\n\n450\n00:24:17.382 --> 00:24:18.370\nIt's pretty easy for me.\n\n451\n00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.440\nSo I go ahead and launch that.\n\n452\n00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:26.380\nIf I go to the File tab, or the backstage\nview, now, it looks very similar.\n\n453\n00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.570\nBut I'm in an open file.\n\n454\n00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:30.710\nSo when I click that little button, Back,\n\n455\n00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.610\nthat's gonna take me back to\nthe file that I'm working with.\n\n456\n00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:38.311\nSo very slight but it really just depends\non whether you have a file open or not but\n\n457\n00:24:38.311 --> 00:24:42.958\nI always like to make that quick little,\npoint that out to you really quickly.\n\n458\n00:24:42.958 --> 00:24:46.838\nSo we've got this and\nif I start going through something and\n\n459\n00:24:46.838 --> 00:24:51.583\nmaybe I make a change, now we'll go\nover how to add text and everything.\n\n460\n00:24:51.583 --> 00:24:53.845\nBut I wanted to go ahead and\nwhat is PowerPoint?\n\n461\n00:24:53.845 --> 00:24:55.397\nAnd I'm going to make a change.\n\n462\n00:24:55.397 --> 00:24:57.446\nI'm gonna say what is PowerPoint!\n\n463\n00:24:57.446 --> 00:24:59.805\nYes, [LAUGH] exclamation point.\n\n464\n00:24:59.805 --> 00:25:01.975\nI have made a change to this file.\n\n465\n00:25:01.975 --> 00:25:06.377\nNow this is where we get into\nFile &gt;

Save As dialog\nbox this way and then use this.\n\n503\n00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.172\nIt's the same thing as just\nwhich way you wanna go.\n\n504\n00:27:05.172 --> 00:27:07.110\nYou wanna go this way,\nyou wanna go that way, all right?\n\n505\n00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:12.313\nSo we're going to say,\nWhat is PowerPoint-Loud.\n\n506\n00:27:12.313 --> 00:27:15.650\n[LAUGH] Cuz I put exclamations so\nit's very loud.\n\n507\n00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:20.010\nSo add a new name and\nI will put it on my desktop up here.\n\n508\n00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.150\nEither place doesn't matter,\nI just clicked on desktop.\n\n509\n00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:26.560\nSo now I know where I'm saving,\nwhat the name is, click Save.\n\n510\n00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.980\nYou can see that up in that title\nbar up there it does make a change.\n\n511\n00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.640\nI'm gonna close the whole program down.\n\n512\n00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.534\nSo I'm gonna go to the Close in\nthe upper right-hand corner.\n\n513\n00:27:34.534 --> 00:27:38.388\nAnd you can see that this is\nwhat is PowerPoint allowed,\n\n514\n00:27:38.388 --> 00:27:43.560\nthe different version, then the one\nthat is in here, what is PowerPoint.\n\n515\n00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:48.613\nSo, I'm actually gonna open\nthe file from the File folder, and\n\n516\n00:27:48.613 --> 00:27:54.432\nthat's where because it is a File,\nit's a PowerPoint file it's a PPTX.\n\n517\n00:27:54.432 --> 00:27:56.808\nIt knows to open within the application.\n\n518\n00:27:56.808 --> 00:28:00.879\nSo open the application and\nopen the file or go to the file lives and\n\n519\n00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:03.860\nthen it opens the application.\n\n520\n00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:04.823\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Which way where you wanna\n\n521\n00:28:04.823 --> 00:28:05.358\ngo, it's fine.\n\n522\n00:28:05.358 --> 00:28:08.269\n&gt;&gt; Vonne,\nwhat about at the top of the screen there?\n\n523\n00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:12.313\nI've notice that the name is changed up\nthere on the top at the very red part that\n\n524\n00:28:12.313 --> 00:28:15.929\nyou have where it say What is\na PowerPoint, why does that keep changing\n\n525\n00:28:15.929 --> 00:28:19.945\nevery time you actually, like when you\ndid a a File &gt; Save As, that changed.\n\n526\n00:28:19.945 --> 00:28:23.340\nAnd when you did that,\nwhat about that name change up there?\n\n527\n00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.570\n&gt;&gt; Well that's because we did\nchange the name of the file.\n\n528\n00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.798\nSo this was the one that I started with.\n\n529\n00:28:27.798 --> 00:28:32.220\nThis was What is PowerPoint within\nthat folder right here, right?\n\n530\n00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.980\nAnd then when I made a Save As and\n\n531\n00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.310\nI changed the name you can see\nthat this one is different.\n\n532\n00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:42.070\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nopen this file from the desktop and\n\n533\n00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:46.420\nyou can see that that title bar is saying\nthat right now what I'm looking at\n\n534\n00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:50.890\nis the Loud file versus the other one.\n\n535\n00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:52.780\nSo the title bar is extremely important.\n\n536\n00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:55.630\nIt always lets you know what\nfile you're working with.\n\n537\n00:28:55.630 --> 00:29:00.220\nAnd right here, since I do have two\nfiles that are opened, I have multiple\n\n538\n00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:04.020\nfiles that are opened at the same time,\nhow can I get back and forth to them?\n\n539\n00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.160\nBecause you can see this is my Loud\none and then I have another one.\n\n540\n00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.530\nThere's quite a few ways, but\n\n541\n00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.470\nI'm just gonna show you\nthe way that I like to do it.\n\n542\n00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.914\nIt's down here on the task bar, okay?\n\n543\n00:29:15.914 --> 00:29:18.749\nI think I can show you,\nyeah, you see how there's,\n\n544\n00:29:18.749 --> 00:29:23.740\nyou can actually see kind of windows that\nlook like they're on top of each other.\n\n545\n00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.270\nWhen you see that down on your task bar\n\n546\n00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.820\nthat indicates that you have\nmultiple files up there.\n\n547\n00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.520\nAnd, so I was like, okay, perfect.\n\n548\n00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.640\nSo, if I click on it,\nyou can see I just did single click there.\n\n549\n00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.210\nIt's showing me that these\nare the two files that\n\n550\n00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:39.370\nI have opened within this application.\n\n551\n00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:43.053\nAnd if I wanted to switch back and forth\nfrom them, I can just go ahead and say,\n\n552\n00:29:43.053 --> 00:29:45.335\nwell, now I wanna go ahead and\nwork on this one.\n\n553\n00:29:45.335 --> 00:29:47.472\nWhoops, sorry let me go ahead and\nget out of that zoom.\n\n554\n00:29:47.472 --> 00:29:52.068\nAll right, so I can go ahead and\nnow there is What is PowerPoint, normal,\n\n555\n00:29:52.068 --> 00:29:56.835\nclick down here, What is PowerPoint-loud,\nand now I'm in the loud file.\n\n556\n00:29:56.835 --> 00:30:01.781\nSo you can switch back and forth from\nyour different open files by looking at\n\n557\n00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:06.725\nthat task bar, seeing which ones you\nwant to go ahead and you put the focus,\n\n558\n00:30:06.725 --> 00:30:12.130\nI think they call it, on that particular\nwindow and that's what brings it up.\n\n559\n00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:15.445\nSo, title bars, multiple files,\nreally important stuff.\n\n560\n00:30:15.445 --> 00:30:18.826\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I noticed this is important\nbecause a lot of times even though\n\n561\n00:30:18.826 --> 00:30:22.030\nit might be multiple different\nPowerPoints it could be that they\n\n562\n00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:24.878\nreally do look similar and\nyou could accidentally edit or\n\n563\n00:30:24.878 --> 00:30:27.530\naccidentally change a file\nthat you don't mean to.\n\n564\n00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:29.698\nSo taking a look at that name is\nprobably very important as well.\n\n565\n00:30:29.698 --> 00:30:34.197\nAll right, Vonne, that's a lot for us to\nactually consider in terms of PowerPoint.\n\n566\n00:30:34.197 --> 00:30:37.430\nBut you had mentioned just\na couple of shortcuts.\n\n567\n00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:40.775\nSo, Vonne, if you were to show us\nsome very important shortcuts,\n\n568\n00:30:40.775 --> 00:30:42.506\nin let's say just a minute or two,\n\n569\n00:30:42.506 --> 00:30:45.755\nwhat would the most important ones\nbe that we want to begin with?\n\n570\n00:30:45.755 --> 00:30:49.322\n&gt;&gt; I would say your biggest one is Ctrl+Z.\n\n571\n00:30:49.322 --> 00:30:52.363\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which is Undo.\n\n572\n00:30:52.363 --> 00:30:57.270\nUndo is probably your\nbest friend in the world.\n\n573\n00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:02.810\nUndo is a common command that I\nthink almost all products use.\n\n574\n00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:06.360\nI say that, but I do remember\na product way back in the day that did\n\n575\n00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.450\nnot have Undo,\nI mean this was a long time ago.\n\n576\n00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:14.563\nSo I didn't wanna do the blanket statement\nof all, but let's just say, almost all.\n\n577\n00:31:14.563 --> 00:31:15.882\nAnd Undo is really important.\n\n578\n00:31:15.882 --> 00:31:20.428\nI wanna go ahead and just show you where\nit's at, and that keyboard shortcut.\n\n579\n00:31:20.428 --> 00:31:21.912\nAgain, do you have to do shortcuts?\n\n580\n00:31:21.912 --> 00:31:23.200\nNo, okay.\n\n581\n00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.823\nI think they're great.\n\n582\n00:31:24.823 --> 00:31:26.830\nAnd if you can get in the habit,\nthat's wonderful.\n\n583\n00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:31.270\nBut they're not required, by any means,\nso I don't want you to think that.\n\n584\n00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:34.765\nSo what if I went, and\nwe're gonna go through this later, but\n\n585\n00:31:34.765 --> 00:31:38.952\nI am just gonna pick this design,\nlike, whoo, okay, now we're green.\n\n586\n00:31:38.952 --> 00:31:40.911\nI didn't want to do that, okay?\n\n587\n00:31:40.911 --> 00:31:42.450\nOops, I messed up.\n\n588\n00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:43.820\nWhere do I go?\n\n589\n00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.580\nUndo is your best friend.\n\n590\n00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:48.948\nUp here,\nthere is an arrow that goes backwards.\n\n591\n00:31:48.948 --> 00:31:51.400\nThat is your Undo button, okay?\n\n592\n00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.468\nAnd you can see,\nin what we call the hover to discover,\n\n593\n00:31:54.468 --> 00:31:58.634\nyou can hover over different things and\nit'll give you a little tool tip.\n\n594\n00:31:58.634 --> 00:32:02.594\nAnd it'll tell you that undo,\nCtrl+Z, you can do that.\n\n595\n00:32:02.594 --> 00:32:06.505\nSo I'm gonna click on that just so\nyou can see that it takes you back, okay?\n\n596\n00:32:06.505 --> 00:32:10.361\nAlways, and you can undo,\nI think you can go back 24.\n\n597\n00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:11.940\n&gt;&gt; Maybe that or more now, yep.\n\n598\n00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:16.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know that there is\na certain amount that you can do.\n\n599\n00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.730\nSo, but you can go back pretty far.\n\n600\n00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:23.790\nAnd then of course if you can undo,\nyou can also redo.\n\n601\n00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:27.641\nSo redo, the arrow pointing forward,\nyou can go ahead and click redo and\n\n602\n00:32:27.641 --> 00:32:29.738\nit takes you back to what you have done.\n\n603\n00:32:29.738 --> 00:32:31.270\nUndo, all right.\n\n604\n00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.480\nSo you'll see me doing that.\n\n605\n00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:37.253\nSo you might actually see me do it but\nnot watch my mouse go to that button.\n\n606\n00:32:37.253 --> 00:32:41.300\nIt's probably because I am just using\nthat Ctrl+Z and I'm going back.\n\n607\n00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.830\nSo that will be actually\ndone probably a lot\n\n608\n00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:49.570\nthroughout the series and\nall the episodes that we're going to do.\n\n609\n00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:52.405\nAnd the only other one that I'd like to\nthrow in here right now would be cut,\n\n610\n00:32:52.405 --> 00:32:53.036\ncopy and paste.\n\n611\n00:32:53.036 --> 00:32:59.490\nCut, copy, and paste is fantastic and\nI actually have it right here.\n\n612\n00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:03.510\nThis is another thing that you can do,\npretty much all through your different\n\n613\n00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:06.560\nproducts, and you can cut or\ncopy something from one application and\n\n614\n00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.720\nthen paste it into your other so\nit's a really good thing.\n\n615\n00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.100\nSo what do you think of when\nyou think of cut, Ronnie?\n\n616\n00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:12.830\n&gt;&gt; Scissors.\n\n617\n00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:13.460\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n618\n00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.661\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It takes it out.\n\n619\n00:33:14.661 --> 00:33:18.549\nYou're going to actually be cutting\nsomething out, removing it from whereever\n\n620\n00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:21.577\nit's at and then you're going\nto be putting it somewhere, and\n\n621\n00:33:21.577 --> 00:33:24.010\nthat's where you're going to be pasting.\n\n622\n00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:26.917\nOkay, so remove and paste or copy.\n\n623\n00:33:26.917 --> 00:33:27.924\nWhat is copy?\n\n624\n00:33:27.924 --> 00:33:29.013\nWell.\n\n625\n00:33:29.013 --> 00:33:29.621\n&gt;&gt; Makes a duplicate.\n\n626\n00:33:29.621 --> 00:33:30.492\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It copies.\n\n627\n00:33:30.492 --> 00:33:33.570\nYes, so you can take something and\nyou can paste it.\n\n628\n00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:36.720\nCtrl+X, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, big ones.\n\n629\n00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.333\nI always think like,\nwhy didn't they do p for paste.\n\n630\n00:33:39.333 --> 00:33:40.077\nWell, 'cuz that's print.\n\n631\n00:33:40.077 --> 00:33:43.749\nI always thought like how paste actually\ncomes down into a point, right?\n\n632\n00:33:43.749 --> 00:33:46.199\nThat's just the way I think of it.\n\n633\n00:33:46.199 --> 00:33:47.124\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go.\n\n634\n00:33:47.124 --> 00:33:51.891\n&gt;&gt; And the biggest thing to notice with\nthe paste is that you have what are known\n\n635\n00:33:51.891 --> 00:33:53.410\nas paste options.\n\n636\n00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:58.350\nAnd that's a big thing between\nyour Office applications as how\n\n637\n00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:01.390\nyou want things to be pasted\nto wherever you're going.\n\n638\n00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:05.400\nAnd we'll be demonstrating that\nas we go through these lessons.\n\n639\n00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.480\nBut cut, copy and paste, big, big thing.\n\n640\n00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.100\nCan save you lots and lots of time and\nI just wanted to go ahead and\n\n641\n00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.050\npoint that out.\n\n642\n00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:13.750\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne.\n\n643\n00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:19.260\nWell like I said, you've shown us a very\ntremendous amount of information for\n\n644\n00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:22.100\nour very first session in\ntaking a look at PowerPoint.\n\n645\n00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:23.330\nLearn that what you saw here, right?\n\n646\n00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:26.460\nIs Vonne telling us how to really\nget started with PowerPoint?\n\n647\n00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.620\nShe talked about the basic product\nitself and what the point is,\n\n648\n00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.290\nof course, behind using it.\n\n649\n00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:35.300\nAnd we also saw some of the basic\nmechanics of how we get to open a file,\n\n650\n00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.660\nas well as save a file and\nunderstand the differences there, too.\n\n651\n00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:41.860\nAnd understand a little bit about the\nnavigation of these files as well which\n\n652\n00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:45.973\nis very important as we get started to\nlearn a little bit more about PowerPoint\n\n653\n00:34:45.973 --> 00:34:46.672\nas well.\n\n654\n00:34:46.672 --> 00:34:50.538\nAll right well, that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode.\n\n655\n00:34:50.538 --> 00:34:54.780\nThank you Vonne for\nshowing us these neat starts and\n\n656\n00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:58.130\nbeginnings and also thank you for\nwatching today.\n\n657\n00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:01.520\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n658\n00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.470\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.375\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:11.049\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.680\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.040\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today\nyou're watching Microsoft PowerPoint 2016.\n\n7\n00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.960\nWe're about to get started into\nthe PowerPoint environment itself.\n\n8\n00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.120\nAnd we're gonna actually\nhave help with us today,\n\n9\n00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.525\nwhich is gonna be our PowerPoint expert,\nMiss Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:30.850\nVonne, how are you doing today?\n\n11\n00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.280\n&gt;&gt; I'm good, glad to be here\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, as we get started and\n\n12\n00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.570\nwe start take a look, and you label\nthis as the PowerPoint environment.\n\n13\n00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.410\nWhy is it so important that we understand\nthe environment that we're working in?\n\n14\n00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.000\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's kind of like walking\ninto a kitchen or into a house.\n\n15\n00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.294\nYou wanna know where the drawer is for\nthe spoons, and where do we find the cups.\n\n16\n00:00:52.294 --> 00:00:54.220\nAnd where's the bedrooms,\nwhere's the bathrooms?\n\n17\n00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.140\nAll those kinds of things of just getting\nfamiliarized with your environment.\n\n18\n00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.950\nBecause it is important, because knowing\nwhere to go will make it easier for\n\n19\n00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.400\nyou to use the product.\n\n20\n00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.270\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt, Vonne.\n\n21\n00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.490\nI've found myself many times in different\ntypes of applications out there,\n\n22\n00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.490\nthat you open it up and\nyou don't exactly know where to start.\n\n23\n00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.648\nSo what you're gonna do today is to help\nus to get started with PowerPoint to learn\n\n24\n00:01:15.648 --> 00:01:18.070\nreally the entire Office environment.\n\n25\n00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.058\nBut we'll end up finding out something\nthat once we learned it in PowerPoint,\n\n26\n00:01:21.058 --> 00:01:26.650\ndon't the actual skills tend to transfer\nover into other types of products, too?\n\n27\n00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.964\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes, we're going to go\nover really not just the PowerPoint\n\n28\n00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:32.620\nenvironment, but\nthe Office environment in general.\n\n29\n00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.412\nAnd I'm going to use\ntheir technical names,\n\n30\n00:01:34.412 --> 00:01:37.920\ntheir real names of what they're referred\nto, because it's always good to know that.\n\n31\n00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.438\nBecause I do tend to say that thing over\nthere, or that line with an X through it.\n\n32\n00:01:42.438 --> 00:01:43.940\nIt's like, well, what exactly is that?\n\n33\n00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.060\nSo I will use our technical words and\nget you familiarized with the quick\n\n34\n00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.916\naccess toolbar and the ribbon, and\nwhat is that, and where is it?\n\n35\n00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:54.640\nAnd so we're just gonna go ahead and\njump right in.\n\n36\n00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.100\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Vonne,\nwhere do we best get started if we're\n\n37\n00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.410\nreally looking at this for\nthe very first time?\n\n38\n00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.619\nWe know that in a previous episode,\nat the very beginning,\n\n39\n00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.530\nyou kind of walked us\nthrough a few things.\n\n40\n00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.800\nBut now, we're really starting\nto get interested in it.\n\n41\n00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.000\nWhere should I begin?\n\n42\n00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.170\n&gt;&gt; Yes, well, for us, for me,\nsince I haven't even opened up PowerPoint,\n\n43\n00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.080\nwe'll start there.\n\n44\n00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.160\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n45\n00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.640\ntype in my little search guy\nthat I'm typing in PowerPoint.\n\n46\n00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.550\nSo you go ahead load, or\nstart the program, for the most part.\n\n47\n00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.530\nAnd we went over our start screen\nin some of our previous episodes.\n\n48\n00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.000\nAnd what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to actually open up a file\n\n49\n00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.610\nthat I've already created.\n\n50\n00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.920\nBecause when I try to teach things,\nI almost like to teach it backwards.\n\n51\n00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.060\nI wanna show you where you can go,\n\n52\n00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.890\nwhat's the finished product,\nbefore you even start.\n\n53\n00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.190\nIt's always like designing backwards.\n\n54\n00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.342\nThat's how I always approach a lot of\nmy things when I'm doing any freelance\n\n55\n00:02:43.342 --> 00:02:45.300\nwork or doing design work.\n\n56\n00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.820\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nopen up another presentation.\n\n57\n00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.230\nAnd I have a file called\nLearn PowerPoint that is on my Desktop.\n\n58\n00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.916\nAnd since it's right there in my Recently\nUsed Items, might as well go ahead and\n\n59\n00:02:55.916 --> 00:02:56.530\nclick on it.\n\n60\n00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.970\nBut we know that we could go and\nnavigate out to our Desktop and\n\n61\n00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.482\nany other place within our\ncomputer from our last episode.\n\n62\n00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:07.544\nAll right, so here is our PowerPoint, our\nfile that has opened within the program.\n\n63\n00:03:07.544 --> 00:03:10.190\nAnd so now, where are we going to go?\n\n64\n00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:17.180\nSo main features or places,\nwe'll say, in the Office environment,\n\n65\n00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.920\nso we always start off with the title bar,\nwhich is up at the top, right there.\n\n66\n00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.280\nSo it used to actually differentiate\nitself in some of your\n\n67\n00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.620\nolder versions of Office products.\n\n68\n00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.374\nBut now it's all a single\ncolor all the way across.\n\n69\n00:03:30.374 --> 00:03:34.135\nAnd PowerPoint's always orange,\nWord's always blue, and\n\n70\n00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:37.040\nExcel's always green,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n71\n00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.372\nWhich you can change, but\nthat'll be for another,\n\n72\n00:03:39.372 --> 00:03:41.710\nwe'll do a whole customization\nepisode sometime.\n\n73\n00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.302\nAnd so we've got out title bar, and\n\n74\n00:03:43.302 --> 00:03:46.608\nunderstand that this is the far that\nwe're working in, so that's good.\n\n75\n00:03:46.608 --> 00:03:52.490\nThe next place to look at would\nbe this little space right here.\n\n76\n00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.260\nSo this little guy across the top,\nthis is known as the ribbon, and\n\n77\n00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.160\nthe ribbon is always at the top.\n\n78\n00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.068\nAnd along the ribbon,\nyou have these things called tabs.\n\n79\n00:04:01.068 --> 00:04:05.910\nWhoops, that's the wrong one, here,\nthere we go, there's my little arrow.\n\n80\n00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.562\nSo these are our tab names\nthat are on our ribbon, and\n\n81\n00:04:09.562 --> 00:04:12.886\nthis is our active tab\nthat we have on right now.\n\n82\n00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:16.480\nSo this is the Home tab on the ribbon.\n\n83\n00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.930\nWe'll go into the ribbon a little bit\nmore in detail in just a little bit.\n\n84\n00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.130\nLet's go down to the bottom, so down here\nacross the bottom, this is the status bar.\n\n85\n00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.850\nSo the status bar gives you things like\nthe status of whatever you're working in.\n\n86\n00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.860\nSo you could see over here that it is\ntelling us that we are on slide 1 of 10.\n\n87\n00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.710\nSo I can see that I have 10 slides\nwithin this presentation, which is nice.\n\n88\n00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.570\nOver here, we have some other\nicons that we'll go over as well.\n\n89\n00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.390\nBut these things that you have,\nthe title bar,\n\n90\n00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.000\nthe ribbon, the status bar,\nand I forgot one.\n\n91\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.586\nWe forgot about the quick access toolbar,\nokay?\n\n92\n00:04:51.586 --> 00:04:54.870\nThe quick access toolbar is right up here,\nokay?\n\n93\n00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.696\nSo it has our frequently used commands\nthat we would like to be able\n\n94\n00:04:59.696 --> 00:05:01.570\nto quickly access.\n\n95\n00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.260\nAnd that's why it's called\nthe quick access toolbar.\n\n96\n00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.311\nSo these features are the same in\nalmost all of your Office products.\n\n97\n00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:12.660\nTitle bar, ribbon, status bar,\nquick access toolbar, and\n\n98\n00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.050\nyou also have some other\nthings over here on the right.\n\n99\n00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.630\nAnd this is where,\nthis is the username, or\n\n100\n00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.710\nthe account that I'm signed in under,\nwhich is Justin Timberlake.\n\n101\n00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.180\nAnd then we have some of our\nShare options over here,\n\n102\n00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.810\nall things that we'll be going\nover in future episodes as well.\n\n103\n00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.790\nBut that identifies our\nmain environment points.\n\n104\n00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.292\nSo let's jump into the ribbon a little but\nmore.\n\n105\n00:05:35.292 --> 00:05:37.090\nAs we said, that these are the tabs.\n\n106\n00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.702\nSo if you single click, don't double\nclick, I'll tell you why in a second.\n\n107\n00:05:41.702 --> 00:05:43.558\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You know where I'm going,\n\n108\n00:05:43.558 --> 00:05:45.180\n[LAUGH] Cuz we've all done it.\n\n109\n00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.860\nAnyways, if you single\nclick on these tabs,\n\n110\n00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.440\nthey will access the items\nthat are in that tab.\n\n111\n00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.660\nSo if I go to the Design tab,\n\n112\n00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.110\nthen that's going to bring up the things\nthat are involved with design.\n\n113\n00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.900\nIf I'm wanting to insert images or\na shape or\n\n114\n00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.690\nsomething, then that would be on\nthe Insert tab, and so on and so forth.\n\n115\n00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.630\nAnd you can go through each one of\nthese tab names to see the different\n\n116\n00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.000\nitems on them.\n\n117\n00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.922\nIn some of your tabs,\nwhat you will have are these little\n\n118\n00:06:14.922 --> 00:06:20.274\nicons down at the bottom of what\nthey call the groups, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:20.274 --> 00:06:24.564\nSo on the Home tab, you can see right\nhere I have a group called Font,\n\n120\n00:06:24.564 --> 00:06:28.570\nI have a group called Paragraph,\nand Slides, and Clipboard.\n\n121\n00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.810\nSo it gives you the group name\nat the bottom of where they are,\n\n122\n00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.580\ncommon commands that are under,\nwell, kinda like a heading, almost.\n\n123\n00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.550\nBut in some of the groups, you have this\nlittle icon at the bottom right-hand\n\n124\n00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.490\ncorner, and\nthat is the dialog box launcher button.\n\n125\n00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.210\nThat's kind of a mouthful.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; It is.\n\n126\n00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.180\n&gt;&gt; Really, it's just more options.\n\n127\n00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.120\nIt's gonna take you to a place where,\nI almost call it the old school button.\n\n128\n00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.240\nBecause it takes you back to the dialog\nboxes that you always used to access in\n\n129\n00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.700\nolder versions of PowerPoint, or\n\n130\n00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.580\nwhatever applications you're working with,\nso you can see that.\n\n131\n00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.170\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne, I'm noticing that you have\nsome icons that look like that they're\n\n132\n00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.570\na little bit more in color.\n\n133\n00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.122\nBut the two groups that you showed us,\n\n134\n00:07:11.122 --> 00:07:14.560\nthose look like that they're\nkind of not really there.\n\n135\n00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.190\nWhat's going on there in terms of that?\n\n136\n00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.424\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they look grayed out, don't they?\n\n137\n00:07:17.424 --> 00:07:18.610\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n138\n00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.130\nWell, that's a good observation.\n\n139\n00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:25.250\nThe reason why they're grayed out is\nbecause we don't have anything selected\n\n140\n00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:30.230\non our slide to be able to\naccess changing the fonts or\n\n141\n00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.040\nthe paragraph spacing or\nanything like that.\n\n142\n00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.715\nSo just to quickly show you,\nif I clicked on an item on the slide,\n\n143\n00:07:35.715 --> 00:07:37.636\nyou can see that it brightens up.\n\n144\n00:07:37.636 --> 00:07:41.809\nAnd it's saying, okay, well now you can\nactually access the things in the Font and\n\n145\n00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:44.385\nthe Paragraph groups when\nyou're on the Home tab.\n\n146\n00:07:44.385 --> 00:07:47.760\nSo good point, so, wonderful.\n\n147\n00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.257\nSo we have our ribbon with our tabs,\nthat's great.\n\n148\n00:07:50.257 --> 00:07:51.742\nNow, that double click thing, right?\n\n149\n00:07:51.742 --> 00:07:53.968\nI'm sure you all are just\non the edge of your seat,\n\n150\n00:07:53.968 --> 00:07:55.563\nlike why did you even mention that?\n\n151\n00:07:55.563 --> 00:08:00.552\nAll right, well, If you double click any\nof your tabs, what you're going to do\n\n152\n00:08:00.552 --> 00:08:04.737\nis you're actually going to what's\ncollapsing the ribbon down.\n\n153\n00:08:04.737 --> 00:08:08.265\nAnd I remember when I first did that\nI'm like what did I do where'd it go?\n\n154\n00:08:08.265 --> 00:08:13.239\nAnd then when you single click it again\nit kinda hangs down over the rest\n\n155\n00:08:13.239 --> 00:08:16.040\nof the information or the slides.\n\n156\n00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.520\nAnd so\nthese are just options of the ribbon okay?\n\n157\n00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.480\nAnd the double clicking\nis actually short cut to\n\n158\n00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.100\ncollapsing the ribbons where you\nare only seeing the tab names and\n\n159\n00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.450\nnot the whole section all\nthe details of the ribbon.\n\n160\n00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.290\nIt is personal preference really.\n\n161\n00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:36.330\nSome people might wanna design this way or\nkinda give you a little bit more room.\n\n162\n00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.110\nI tend to like to see all\nof my options at all times.\n\n163\n00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:43.454\nSo I can double click it again and\nit will go ahead and\n\n164\n00:08:43.454 --> 00:08:46.192\nexpand out the ribbon options.\n\n165\n00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:50.361\nAnd something newer, or at least in some\nof your newer versions of PowerPoint,\n\n166\n00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:53.650\nthey have this little button\nup at the top right here.\n\n167\n00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.429\nIt's like this little right there.\n\n168\n00:08:56.429 --> 00:09:00.430\nThat little guy that is\nour Ribbon Options button.\n\n169\n00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:04.380\nSo, if I click it you can see that it\nhas the Auto-hide ribbon, show tabs, and\n\n170\n00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.740\nshow tabs and commands.\n\n171\n00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.205\nAnd that's the one that we're on,\nwe're on show tabs and commands.\n\n172\n00:09:08.205 --> 00:09:11.683\nAnd I'm actually just showing you the\nshortcut of how we actually got to that,\n\n173\n00:09:11.683 --> 00:09:15.020\nrather than go through the options,\nbut you have it in different places.\n\n174\n00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.820\nSo, at least now you know where\nthey're all at and to avoid it or\n\n175\n00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:23.502\nuse it if that's your preference of how\nyou want to have the ribbon look like.\n\n176\n00:09:23.502 --> 00:09:26.892\n&gt;&gt; All right Yvonne, I noticed something\nelse about your screen too, and\n\n177\n00:09:26.892 --> 00:09:30.680\nsomebody sitting at home may be,\nwhere they've got PowerPoint open.\n\n178\n00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.880\nThey might be looking at your particular\nribbons that you're seeing under the tabs.\n\n179\n00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.700\nAnd they say hay, that doesn't look\nlike mine when I click on that.\n\n180\n00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.273\nSo, Yvonne, what's going on there if\nyou actually see some things that look\n\n181\n00:09:41.273 --> 00:09:43.302\na little bit different from\nwhat you're actually showing.\n\n182\n00:09:43.302 --> 00:09:48.099\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you're highlighting\nthe autosizing of the Office environment\n\n183\n00:09:48.099 --> 00:09:50.300\ndepending on your resolution.\n\n184\n00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.498\nSo, I have a specific screen\nresolution on this monitor right now.\n\n185\n00:09:54.498 --> 00:09:57.840\nAnd so, specifically,\nif I go to the home tab right now,\n\n186\n00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.060\nyou could see that I just\nhave these little icons.\n\n187\n00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.400\nWell if I had a higher resolution monitor,\nlike maybe you have a higher resolution,\n\n188\n00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.180\nyou can actually see names\nnext to those buttons.\n\n189\n00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.940\nI think this is a slide layout,\nreset slide and sections.\n\n190\n00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.402\nI think those are the names next to it.\n\n191\n00:10:12.402 --> 00:10:15.466\nIf you see names that's just\nbecause you have a wider,\n\n192\n00:10:15.466 --> 00:10:19.076\nit's like more real estate basically for\nyou to be able to do it.\n\n193\n00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:20.800\nAnd you probably see shapes and arrange.\n\n194\n00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.564\nSo I'm gonna actually show you the resort\ndown button which is up in the top.\n\n195\n00:10:24.564 --> 00:10:26.790\nWhere I'm actually going to minimize this.\n\n196\n00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:31.500\nYou can see that if I took this window and\nactually made it smaller,\n\n197\n00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.320\ndo you see how now like the paragraph and\n\n198\n00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.330\nthe drawing, those have kind of\ncollapsed in their size, and\n\n199\n00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:42.850\nnow it just becomes if I click it, it\nbecomes options that drop down, because my\n\n200\n00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.710\nspace that this program\nis occupying is smaller.\n\n201\n00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.905\nSo it's gonna show the last things.\n\n202\n00:10:49.905 --> 00:10:54.320\nSo there its just, you know, words\ndisplaying for you so, great observations.\n\n203\n00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.872\nI'm glad you pointed that out for me\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n204\n00:10:56.872 --> 00:10:59.808\nYvonne now that we understand\na little bit more about this\n\n205\n00:10:59.808 --> 00:11:03.553\nidea of the way that this ribbon is\nworking across those different tabs.\n\n206\n00:11:03.553 --> 00:11:06.614\nWe understand that there's many tools for\nus that we're gonna\n\n207\n00:11:06.614 --> 00:11:09.975\nbe able to use to help us to make our\nPowerPoint the way that we want to.\n\n208\n00:11:09.975 --> 00:11:12.805\nWhat are some of the other options\nthat we also have to consider?\n\n209\n00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:17.745\n&gt;&gt; And on that same note, if you wanna\nsay, the commands that you're accessing\n\n210\n00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:22.685\non the ribbon If you do a lot of them,\nlike if you're always inserting image or\n\n211\n00:11:22.685 --> 00:11:27.230\nthings like that, you can add\nthem to the quick access toolbar.\n\n212\n00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.920\nOr remember our best friend, undo right?\n\n213\n00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.530\nIf you wanna quickly\naccess the undo button,\n\n214\n00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.730\nyou can access it through the quick\naccess toolbar with is right up here.\n\n215\n00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.210\nSo let's jump back in there.\n\n216\n00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:37.800\nSo like I said,\n\n217\n00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.550\nright up here at the top, this is going\nto be our commonly used commands.\n\n218\n00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:46.230\nAnd the nice thing is, like let's\nsay I was on the slide show tab.\n\n219\n00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.800\nAnd did something and I need it to undo.\n\n220\n00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.570\nWell instead of going back to,\nwhoops that was the wrong one.\n\n221\n00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.640\nBack to Home and back to the Undo button.\n\n222\n00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.083\nOr is the Undo even on the Home?\n\n223\n00:11:57.083 --> 00:11:57.980\nI always use the button.\n\n224\n00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.104\nI actually forgot where it's at.\n\n225\n00:11:59.104 --> 00:12:03.666\n[LAUGH] So you can see that you can access\nthese commonly used commands on the quick\n\n226\n00:12:03.666 --> 00:12:05.010\naccess toolbar.\n\n227\n00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:08.150\nBut like I said, insert image,\nthings like, it's not on there.\n\n228\n00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:12.540\nAll I have is file save, Undo,\nRedo, and run slide show.\n\n229\n00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.500\nThis little guy at the very end of\nour quick access toolbar is going to\n\n230\n00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.370\nallow us to customize this.\n\n231\n00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:22.303\nIf you drop this down you can see that it\nhas some commonly used items that people\n\n232\n00:12:22.303 --> 00:12:25.391\nusually like to add to\nthe Quick Access tool bar.\n\n233\n00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:30.376\nSo I could put the spelling,\nthat's always a good thing, or print, but\n\n234\n00:12:30.376 --> 00:12:32.680\nI really wanted to Insert Image.\n\n235\n00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.000\nWell I know that the command let me just\nquickly go to it really there, so I know\n\n236\n00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.570\nit's on the Insert Tab, of the Ribbon, and\nI know it's there where it says Pictures.\n\n237\n00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:44.540\nBut I don't wanna have\nto keep going to that.\n\n238\n00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.868\nSo let's add that to\nthe quick access toolbar.\n\n239\n00:12:48.868 --> 00:12:50.172\nSo I'm gonna click on that.\n\n240\n00:12:50.172 --> 00:12:52.636\nYou go down to More Commands.\n\n241\n00:12:52.636 --> 00:12:55.350\nSounds about right.\n\n242\n00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.982\nSo you go to More Commands and\n\n243\n00:12:56.982 --> 00:13:01.677\nthen you have to look at how you're going\nto customize this quick access toolbar.\n\n244\n00:13:01.677 --> 00:13:05.050\nAnd may be is not little list,\nbecause it is showing up here.\n\n245\n00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.722\nIt's showing we are looking\nat the popular commands, or\n\n246\n00:13:07.722 --> 00:13:10.068\nmay be your command isn't\nin that popular group.\n\n247\n00:13:10.068 --> 00:13:12.560\nSo we are gonna go over\nhere to our drop down.\n\n248\n00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.550\nAnd you are going to find\nwhere that command is located.\n\n249\n00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.970\nWhich is on,\nwe know it's on the insert tab.\n\n250\n00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.043\nSo if I click on that,\n\n251\n00:13:19.043 --> 00:13:22.576\nnow it's gonna show me all of\nthe commands that live on the insert tab.\n\n252\n00:13:22.576 --> 00:13:25.156\nAnd then I can scroll on\ndown through here and\n\n253\n00:13:25.156 --> 00:13:27.890\nI could say okay well\nthere's insert images.\n\n254\n00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.115\nOr I could say I think it was insert\npictures that we were looking for\n\n255\n00:13:30.115 --> 00:13:30.762\nright there it is.\n\n256\n00:13:30.762 --> 00:13:31.990\nThere's online pictures.\n\n257\n00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:33.070\nHey we'll go with that.\n\n258\n00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.865\n[LAUGH] So I'll say I want to add this.\n\n259\n00:13:35.865 --> 00:13:38.855\nYou can click the Add button\nin the middle of your screen.\n\n260\n00:13:38.855 --> 00:13:42.695\nAnd then it just moves it right on\nover to the Quick Access toolbar.\n\n261\n00:13:42.695 --> 00:13:46.125\nAnd you can do this as many times as you\nwant with as many commands as you want.\n\n262\n00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:49.515\nAnd then down at the very\nbottom which is behind my head.\n\n263\n00:13:49.515 --> 00:13:51.915\nYou can see that we have the OK\nbutton that you're saying,\n\n264\n00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:55.680\nyes, I'm done customizing\nmy Quick Access tool bar.\n\n265\n00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.432\nAnd you can see right there,\n\n266\n00:13:57.432 --> 00:14:01.960\nthat command is now on my Quick Access\ntool bar which is very, very handy.\n\n267\n00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.133\nI use this and I kinda start loading up\nthat quick access tool bar with a lot of\n\n268\n00:14:06.133 --> 00:14:08.200\ndifferent things that I like to use.\n\n269\n00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.306\n&gt;&gt; Ivana, I really agree on this\nidea of the quick access tool bar.\n\n270\n00:14:11.306 --> 00:14:15.520\nIt's the one place I like to use those\nvery one click things that I'd like to do.\n\n271\n00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.240\nBut I can't remember exactly\nwhere they are inside the ribbon.\n\n272\n00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.488\nSo, It really does help me, when I\nset up that quick access toolbar, and\n\n273\n00:14:21.488 --> 00:14:24.870\nget everything else to attached, and\nend up working the way that I want to.\n\n274\n00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.271\nAll right so now Yvonne,\n\n275\n00:14:26.271 --> 00:14:30.809\nnow that we have kind of a nice little\nworking knowledge of using PowerPoint, and\n\n276\n00:14:30.809 --> 00:14:35.070\nunderstand the tools that we can use\nto help us to build a PowerPoint.\n\n277\n00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.110\nWhat are some of the other features\nthat we also wanna know about\n\n278\n00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.120\ninside of our kitchen environment here?\n\n279\n00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we're in the kitchen, now.\n\n280\n00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:41.920\nYes, exactly.\n\n281\n00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.492\nSo, we're going to go into\nthis little cupboard.\n\n282\n00:14:44.492 --> 00:14:48.030\nDown at the bottom, the status bar.\n\n283\n00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:54.482\nNot too much going on here, but It gives\nyou the slide numbers like I said before.\n\n284\n00:14:54.482 --> 00:14:56.187\nBut over here on the right hand side,\n\n285\n00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:59.504\nyou can see there is a couple of other\nbuttons that I wanted to point out.\n\n286\n00:14:59.504 --> 00:15:03.673\nThe notes, which we'll get into when\nwe talk more in the actual like slide\n\n287\n00:15:03.673 --> 00:15:05.702\nenvironment of the presentation.\n\n288\n00:15:05.702 --> 00:15:07.965\nIt's where you can show or\nhide your speaker notes,\n\n289\n00:15:07.965 --> 00:15:09.670\nwhich are in the bottom of your slides.\n\n290\n00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:13.084\nIf you keep going over,\nyou also have shortcut,\n\n291\n00:15:13.084 --> 00:15:17.450\nif you wanna say to the different\nviews that you can access.\n\n292\n00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:21.040\nNow this is the same as if you went\nto the view tab on your ribbon.\n\n293\n00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.520\nSo I'm just jumping back up over here.\n\n294\n00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.623\nAnd see how the icons actually\nlook the same as they do, or\n\n295\n00:15:26.623 --> 00:15:31.514\nvery similar, to the ones down here\non the bottom of the status bar.\n\n296\n00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:35.020\nSo, if you didn't know what those\nbuttons were, you also have\n\n297\n00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:40.030\na fun little thing that we call hover to\ndiscover that I think we mentioned before.\n\n298\n00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.860\nYou can hover over the icons and\n\n299\n00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.880\nit will give you the tool tip\nof what these icons mean.\n\n300\n00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.200\nSo we have the normal or the slide\nsorter view, I'll just go ahead and\n\n301\n00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.860\nclick on them since I'm already there.\n\n302\n00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.550\nSlide sorter view gives you a different\nview of what you're looking at.\n\n303\n00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:56.313\nYou can also get to the reading view,\nwhich takes you into this kind of it's\n\n304\n00:15:56.313 --> 00:15:59.330\na little strange for me but\nit does have its purpose.\n\n305\n00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.072\nBut, once I'm in the reading view,\nyou're like where did I go?\n\n306\n00:16:01.072 --> 00:16:03.619\nWell Just go back to the normal view and\nyou're okay.\n\n307\n00:16:03.619 --> 00:16:09.040\nAnd then we have running the slide show,\nbut we're not gonna get to that just yet.\n\n308\n00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.480\nWe also have our zooms over\nhere of zooming in and\n\n309\n00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:18.230\nout of what we can actually see on our\nscreen if you wanna say, within our slide.\n\n310\n00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.960\nSo, if you click the little plus sign\nto the right, that is zoom in, so\n\n311\n00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.600\nyou can see, we're zooming in.\n\n312\n00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.400\nIf you click the little minus,\nit zooms out.\n\n313\n00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.350\nThat's nice.\n\n314\n00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.510\nYou also have the actual numbers,\n\n315\n00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:33.160\nthe actual percentage of the zooms\nthat you can click on and\n\n316\n00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.245\nactually get to a dialogue box that allows\nyou to change the zoom if you wanted to.\n\n317\n00:16:38.245 --> 00:16:43.065\nAnd then this little button over here\non the very, very right is where it's\n\n318\n00:16:43.065 --> 00:16:47.214\nactually going to click on the,\nyou're gonna fill the screen.\n\n319\n00:16:47.214 --> 00:16:48.690\nThat's what it is.\nI should probably hover and\n\n320\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:49.534\nread what it says.\n\n321\n00:16:49.534 --> 00:16:50.974\nPlease slide to current window,\nthey we go.\n\n322\n00:16:50.974 --> 00:16:53.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So,\n\n323\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.290\nI use this tool tips to actually help me,\nthere we go do.\n\n324\n00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.956\nSo that's what we've got\ngoing on with our status bar.\n\n325\n00:16:58.956 --> 00:17:03.790\nOne little small side note, and this is\nthe same for ll of your office products.\n\n326\n00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.980\nYou can add different things that you\nwant to display on the status bar.\n\n327\n00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.060\nLike I did this in Word a lot.\n\n328\n00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.510\nI think it's like for word count.\n\n329\n00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.210\nLike I really want to show the word count.\n\n330\n00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.680\nIf you right click on your status bar,\n\n331\n00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.230\nit will give you different options\nof what you can view on it.\n\n332\n00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:21.570\nIn PowerPoint,\nit's kind of showing us everything.\n\n333\n00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:23.750\nSo there's not much, but.\n\n334\n00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.510\nLike if I wanted to add what\ndesign theme that I'm working in,\n\n335\n00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:28.490\nyou can see that I can add\nthat to the status bar.\n\n336\n00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.400\nLike I said,\nI think some of the options in Word,\n\n337\n00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.890\nI use a little bit more\nthan within PowerPoint.\n\n338\n00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.370\nBut that's what you can do there.\n\n339\n00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.180\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nSo Vonne,\n\n340\n00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:42.572\nnow that we have the kinds of features\nin terms of manipulating here.\n\n341\n00:17:42.572 --> 00:17:45.700\nA PowerPoint, and building a PowerPoint,\n\n342\n00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:49.060\nwhat if I just wanted to see what\nyou already have on the screen.\n\n343\n00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:53.565\nThat you have a PowerPoint presentation,\nand I wanted to just do a preview of my\n\n344\n00:17:53.565 --> 00:17:57.280\nPowerPoint, what are some of the things\nI need to be able to see here?\n\n345\n00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.860\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nonce we’ve got our Office environment\n\n346\n00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:04.110\nkind of figured out The actual\nenvironment within PowerPoint,\n\n347\n00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.870\nbecause this is not gonna look\nthe same in Word or Excel.\n\n348\n00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:11.180\nSo you have the slides cuz we're working\nwith slides in our presentation.\n\n349\n00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.330\nSo if we look down into here,\nthis screen right over here,\n\n350\n00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:17.400\nthe big screen that we're working on,\nthat's actually gonna show you your slide.\n\n351\n00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.200\nOkay?\n\n352\n00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.300\nAnd you have a little scroll on\nthe right-hand side that will allow you to\n\n353\n00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.850\nscroll down through your slide,\n\n354\n00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.980\njust like if you were scrolling through\npages in Word, something that effect.\n\n355\n00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:32.450\nBut you can also scroll through slides or\naccess your slides from\n\n356\n00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:36.630\nthe slides pane, or the slides tab,\nwhichever one you wanna call.\n\n357\n00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.390\nBut it just gives you the little\nthumbnails of your different\n\n358\n00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:44.435\nslides within your slideshow,\nit slides a lot.\n\n359\n00:18:44.435 --> 00:18:48.380\n[LAUGH] So you have your different\nscrolls that you can access and\n\n360\n00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.380\nshow which ones you want to go to.\n\n361\n00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.340\nSo, if I wanted to scroll down and find,\n\n362\n00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.370\nlet's say slide six,\nall I have to do is single click on it.\n\n363\n00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:59.890\nAnd then it goes ahead and\nshows me that this is my active slide,\n\n364\n00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.170\nbecause you can actually\nsee it in your slides pane.\n\n365\n00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:04.690\nAnd it also give you that\nlittle red box around the slide\n\n366\n00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.250\nto let you know that\nthis is the active slide.\n\n367\n00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.120\nAnd you can also use your down and\n\n368\n00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.060\nup arrows to go ahead and navigate\nthrough your different slides there.\n\n369\n00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.170\nAnd you can see then it just\nshows whatever slide is\n\n370\n00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:19.420\nactive in the slides pane.\n\n371\n00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:23.160\nWe kind of already mentioned it, but this\narea down here is for your speaker notes.\n\n372\n00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.660\nWhat would that be?\n\n373\n00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.790\nWell that would be the things that you,\n\n374\n00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:32.270\nas a speaker delivering this presentation\ncould print out for, it's for viewing.\n\n375\n00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:36.050\nYou're going to use it on your piece\nof paper, of here's my slide, and\n\n376\n00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:36.950\nthese are my notes, and\n\n377\n00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:40.970\nI'm going to use that as reference\nwhile I'm delivering my presentation.\n\n378\n00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.020\nThat's what the speaker notes are for,\nokay?\n\n379\n00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.350\nAnd you can see that each\nslide that I click on,\n\n380\n00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:50.370\nI have different speaker notes\nalong the way to kind of remind me\n\n381\n00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:56.100\nof what I need to say when I'm\ndelivering that presentation.\n\n382\n00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:59.360\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, right over there on your\nleft-hand side where you have your slide\n\n383\n00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.710\npane, I noticed that the number 3 looks\na little bit strange, what is that about?\n\n384\n00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:04.380\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n385\n00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.020\nThose are the different indications of\n\n386\n00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.060\ndifferent things within your\nslide show presentation.\n\n387\n00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.190\nSo good observation.\n\n388\n00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.490\nThat is like a little\nslash to the number 3 and\n\n389\n00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:15.320\nI'll even show you some\nthat we hadn't gone to.\n\n390\n00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.796\nThere is like little\nstars below the 8 then 9.\n\n391\n00:20:18.796 --> 00:20:22.555\nThose indicate things like,\nwell tell me what they are.\n\n392\n00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:27.140\n[LAUGH] The slash through the three, that\nindicates that this is a hidden slide.\n\n393\n00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:31.670\nIt means that it will not show\nwhen I actually run the show or\n\n394\n00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:32.900\nrun the presentation.\n\n395\n00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.020\nSo, why would you want to hide slides?\n\n396\n00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:35.950\nFor different purposes.\n\n397\n00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:39.800\nI mean maybe you're having different\naudiences, and you don't want certain\n\n398\n00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.290\naudiences to see certain slides and\nother audiences to see slides.\n\n399\n00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:46.310\nThat could be one reason why\nyou'd wanna hide slides.\n\n400\n00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:50.250\nThe little stars, now you're not gonna see\nanything when I click on the slide and\n\n401\n00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.720\nit actually shows up on the slide pane but\n\n402\n00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:56.050\nthat is an indication to me that\nthere is some type of animation.\n\n403\n00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:00.510\nWhether it is the slide transition or\nit is the slide content animation,\n\n404\n00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.420\nsome type of animation is in there.\n\n405\n00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.680\nSo that's where you got that.\n\n406\n00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:12.050\nAnd then above these, you notice that\nthere is a little name above this.\n\n407\n00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:15.470\nThese are sections, you can add sections.\n\n408\n00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:18.090\nWhy, cuz you wanna just use it for\norganization purposes.\n\n409\n00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:23.540\nAnd the nice thing about the sections is\nthat you can use them to collapse down,\n\n410\n00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.070\nso you could collapse certain parts of\nyour show which I think could be really,\n\n411\n00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.160\nreally handy.\n\n412\n00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.510\nAgain, it's really more for\nyou as the creator of the presentation and\n\n413\n00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:35.010\nwhen you deliver it, there are different\noptions of why you want to\n\n414\n00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:36.720\nuse sections which we will get into.\n\n415\n00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:41.100\nBut at least wanna acknowledge\nthat that's what those things\n\n416\n00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.400\nare within our slide panes.\n\n417\n00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.440\nSo we got our different icons,\nour numbers, and our sections over here.\n\n418\n00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.900\nSpeaker notes, slide pane.\n\n419\n00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:54.200\nSo that's our basic environment\nof our PowerPoint presentation.\n\n420\n00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:59.020\nAnd I just wanted to show you\nwhat those animations are.\n\n421\n00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.700\nSo we're going to run the show.\n\n422\n00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.510\nSo I'm going to show you\neverything in this presentation.\n\n423\n00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.220\nAnd everything that we have on these\nslides with the layouts and the pictures,\n\n424\n00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.470\nwe're going to learn how to do\nthrough this entire series.\n\n425\n00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:09.340\nSo it will be really fun.\n\n426\n00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.910\nAnd we'll see a lot of my cats.\n\n427\n00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:11.475\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n428\n00:22:11.475 --> 00:22:13.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nif I'm going to run the slide show,\n\n429\n00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.460\nwhat tab do you think I'm\ngoing to go to on the ribbon.\n\n430\n00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.070\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to say Slideshow.\n\n431\n00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.660\n&gt;&gt; That would be right.\n\n432\n00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:18.880\nAnd I was hovering over it wasn't I?\n\n433\n00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.750\nSo [LAUGH] gave you a little hint.\n\n434\n00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.830\nSo in the slide show I'm\ngoing to go ahead and\n\n435\n00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.510\nrun it from the beginning because\nthat's what I want to do.\n\n436\n00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.490\nAnd then it goes ahead and\ngoes into presentation mode.\n\n437\n00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:29.000\nAll right.\n\n438\n00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.360\nSo this would be like up on your screen\nbehind you or wherever you have and\n\n439\n00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.140\nyou're gonna say,\nlet's learn about PowerPoint.\n\n440\n00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.320\nI can introduce myself and\nso on and so forth.\n\n441\n00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.280\nHow do I go ahead and advance the slide?\n\n442\n00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.160\nThere's a lot of ways but for now I'm\njust gonna tell you, you just click.\n\n443\n00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.940\nOkay, so we're gonna click with our mouse\nand then you can see that we have a text\n\n444\n00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.940\nslide that we can go ahead and\ntalk about our different bullet points\n\n445\n00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.250\nthat we're go over, tables and charts,\nand we're gonna talk all about the cats.\n\n446\n00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.000\nWe'll probably throw in some\npictures about dogs and\n\n447\n00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.780\nsunsets and flowers to keep it\nmultifaceted for everybody.\n\n448\n00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.575\nAnd then we have, these are my stars.\n\n449\n00:22:59.575 --> 00:23:01.300\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Meow, meow.\n\n450\n00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.110\n&gt;&gt; Meow, meow, yes.\n\n451\n00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.484\nSo this is Fuego and Bishop so\n\n452\n00:23:03.484 --> 00:23:06.358\nyou can see that this is where\nI'm adding images to slides.\n\n453\n00:23:06.358 --> 00:23:07.657\nAnd then we can compare, so\n\n454\n00:23:07.657 --> 00:23:11.200\nwe have different layouts of how I\nwant to present the information.\n\n455\n00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.890\nSo you can see that Fuego and Bishop, they\nare big brother and little brother, and\n\n456\n00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:16.420\nI would go over each one of these points.\n\n457\n00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.520\nRolling through this presentation.\n\n458\n00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.310\n&gt;&gt; Right, nice.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We have charts and tables so\n\n459\n00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:25.570\nyou can see that we'll be adding,\nwell charts and tables, or\n\n460\n00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:28.830\nI guess I should tables and charts\nbecause I have the table on the left.\n\n461\n00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:29.795\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyways, we'll keep going.\n\n462\n00:23:29.795 --> 00:23:33.270\n[LAUGH] All right, and\nthen we're gonna go ahead and\n\n463\n00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.380\nwe're gonna add SmartArt\nwhich is kinda fun.\n\n464\n00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.880\nWe can have our different diagrams.\n\n465\n00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.490\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\n\n466\n00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.763\nyou can see that Dad's just the assistant.\n\n467\n00:23:39.763 --> 00:23:43.373\n[LAUGH] Here,\nthis is our slide with basic animation.\n\n468\n00:23:43.373 --> 00:23:47.525\nSo as you can see, maybe you noticed that\nwhen you have the slide with all the texts\n\n469\n00:23:47.525 --> 00:23:49.496\non it, you read it all, didn't you?\n\n470\n00:23:49.496 --> 00:23:50.090\nRight?\n\n471\n00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:54.840\nBut I want to control how\nthe points I want to make come up.\n\n472\n00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.510\nSo I can say here we go,\nlet's talk about this first point and\n\n473\n00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.760\nyou're not reading ahead.\n\n474\n00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.700\nSo some of these basic animation can be\nreally helpful on how you can control\n\n475\n00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.950\nthe pace of your presentation.\n\n476\n00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:10.200\nAnd then another animation because\nI forgot what my third point was,\n\n477\n00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.560\nis where another animation that you saw\non that slide was slide transitions.\n\n478\n00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.902\nGet ready.\n\n479\n00:24:15.902 --> 00:24:16.474\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n480\n00:24:16.474 --> 00:24:20.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay,\nyou probably want to use those sparingly.\n\n481\n00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.030\nThat would start to get\na little annoying after awhile.\n\n482\n00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:25.540\nSo you can see that was the transition,\nthat was the animation,\n\n483\n00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.710\nthat was on this particular slide.\n\n484\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:28.540\nAnd then there we go.\n\n485\n00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.960\nThere's my last slide.\n\n486\n00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.670\nAnd presentations always end where\nyou can stop on a black screen, so\n\n487\n00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.200\nthey don't actually see the last slide.\n\n488\n00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:39.100\nWhether you wanna stop on the last slide\nor on this blank screen, or black screen,\n\n489\n00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.070\nwe should say.\n\n490\n00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:41.380\nYou just go ahead and\nclick one more time, and\n\n491\n00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.370\nthen you're back in PowerPoint and\nthat is the finished product of\n\n492\n00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.008\nall the different things that\nwe're gonna learn about.\n\n493\n00:24:48.008 --> 00:24:51.670\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne, well thank you again\nfor helping at least to get started.\n\n494\n00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:53.750\nTaking a look at the environment\nthat we're gonna be working in,\n\n495\n00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:56.110\nit's gonna really be helpful learning it,\n\n496\n00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.380\nit's gonna be helpful as you\ngo throughout this series.\n\n497\n00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.690\nBecause instead of you just trying to\nguess where Vonne is now clicking,\n\n498\n00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:04.730\nshe's showing you exactly the areas\nthat you'll be working in.\n\n499\n00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:08.690\nSo that way the time and the learning that\nyou'll actually spend will be more spent\n\n500\n00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:13.280\non those things rather than just I wonder\nwhere Vonne actually meant that to be, or\n\n501\n00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.860\nwhat did she say, where was that?\n\n502\n00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:18.115\nShe actually kind of lead you through that\nas we go throughout the show as well.\n\n503\n00:25:18.115 --> 00:25:20.960\nVonne also of course showed us\nthe way that we can navigate and\n\n504\n00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.950\nbe able to look at the presentation area.\n\n505\n00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:25.770\nAnd then she showed us how\nto run a slideshow as well,\n\n506\n00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.680\nshowing us some of those different\nthings that can be in our slideshow.\n\n507\n00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.960\nAnd these are all the elements that\nwe'll be including during this entire\n\n508\n00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.240\nseries, too.\n\n509\n00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.130\nSo, Vonne, thank you very much for\nhelping us to get started in\n\n510\n00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:40.230\nPowerPoint environment, and\nthank you also for watching as well.\n\n511\n00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:42.980\nBut this is a great place for\nus to end this episode.\n\n512\n00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:46.400\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n513\n00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.520\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n514\n00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.906\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Microsoft PowerPoint 2016 shows.\n\n515\n00:25:51.906 --> 00:25:57.503\n[MUSIC]\n\n516\n00:25:57.503 --> 00:25:59.930\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.334\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:12.038\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.038 --> 00:00:15.170\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPROTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.420\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today\nyou're watching Microsoft Powerpoint 2016.\n\n7\n00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.320\nWe're about to get started\nworking with slides,\n\n8\n00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.825\nand here to help us out is gonna be our\nsubject matter expert, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:28.152\nVonne, welcome back to our show,\nhow are you doing today?\n\n10\n00:00:28.152 --> 00:00:29.578\n&gt;&gt; Good, thanks for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:29.578 --> 00:00:32.693\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne,\ngreat to have you back on PowerPoint, and\n\n12\n00:00:32.693 --> 00:00:35.360\nwe are ready to start working with slides.\n\n13\n00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.716\nWhere are we gonna begin today?\n\n14\n00:00:36.716 --> 00:00:42.400\n&gt;&gt; So, we're gonna start with just our\nbasics of selecting and modifying objects.\n\n15\n00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.378\nNow we're going to be adding a lot of\ncontent throughout our slides in all of\n\n16\n00:00:47.378 --> 00:00:48.571\nthese episodes.\n\n17\n00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:52.449\nSo we're just gonna start out with\nsomething really, really basic, just so\n\n18\n00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.090\nI can demonstrate some of the formatting.\n\n19\n00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.920\nOr actually not really formatting, just\nthe working with the slides in general.\n\n20\n00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.390\nSo we're gonna start there, and\nthen we're gonna move on of adding slides,\n\n21\n00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.459\ndeleting slides, and doing all\nsorts of fun stuff with our slides.\n\n22\n00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.900\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne, I understand\nthat as we start to make PowerPoint\n\n23\n00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.660\ndemonstrations that want to be able to do,\nor\n\n24\n00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.310\npresentations, the slide is kind of\nthe basic unit that we're working with.\n\n25\n00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.586\nSo, when we actually make them,\nare we doing this from scratch?\n\n26\n00:01:21.586 --> 00:01:24.310\nOr is there something else that\nwe're actually starting with?\n\n27\n00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.470\nHow are we gonna begin?\n\n28\n00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.990\n&gt;&gt; Well, in this episode we're\ngonna start from a blank document.\n\n29\n00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.495\nSo, I figured just start from the very\nbeginning, and just dive right in.\n\n30\n00:01:31.495 --> 00:01:35.250\nSo I've actually already got\nPowerPoint opened on my computer.\n\n31\n00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.180\nSo, we're just gonna start\non the Start screen.\n\n32\n00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.430\nAnd well, there's blank presentation,\nso let's go with blank presentation.\n\n33\n00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.690\nAnd we're gonna stay working\nin blank presentations for\n\n34\n00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.980\nquite a few episodes if you're\nwatching this in a sequence,\n\n35\n00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.970\nbefore we get into making them\nlook really, really pretty.\n\n36\n00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.540\nSo, that comes down a little bit later.\n\n37\n00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.350\nSo, let's just get our stuff in, learn how\nto work with it, and we'll go from there.\n\n38\n00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.942\nSo, you can see any time that\nyou start a blank presentation,\n\n39\n00:01:58.942 --> 00:02:02.690\nyou always start off with\nwhat's called the title slide.\n\n40\n00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.350\nBecause every slide has a specific\nlayout that you can implement to it.\n\n41\n00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.750\nSo the default one,\nif you're starting from the beginning,\n\n42\n00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.510\nis the title of the presentation.\n\n43\n00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.260\nSo that means the default layout of\nwhat they call these placeholder items.\n\n44\n00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.040\nSo where it says, we can read that it\nsays Double tap to add a title, and\n\n45\n00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.880\nDouble tap to add a subtitle.\n\n46\n00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.790\nSo, this particular layout has\ndifferent content boxes, or\n\n47\n00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.240\nlike I said, placeholders,\n\n48\n00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.320\nthat are kind of guiding you as to this is\nwhat you should put in the title slide.\n\n49\n00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.053\nSo we're gonna keep going with what\nPowerPoint is suggesting to us,\n\n50\n00:02:42.053 --> 00:02:45.903\nbecause I really want to\nemphasize mouse cursor icons.\n\n51\n00:02:45.903 --> 00:02:50.583\nThat's probably one of the biggest things\nin any Office product to really pay\n\n52\n00:02:50.583 --> 00:02:51.527\nattention to.\n\n53\n00:02:51.527 --> 00:02:54.442\nAnd cuz I've noticed along the years\npeople are like, well I'm clicking, and\n\n54\n00:02:54.442 --> 00:02:55.456\nit's not doing anything.\n\n55\n00:02:55.456 --> 00:02:57.416\nI'm like well,\nwhat does your mouse cursor look like?\n\n56\n00:02:57.416 --> 00:02:58.770\nAnd they go I don't know.\n\n57\n00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.460\nWell that actually makes a big difference,\n\n58\n00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.880\nbecause that indicates what\nyou're gonna do, all right?\n\n59\n00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.460\nSo, if I'm out here, so\nI'm out like kind of in the blank area.\n\n60\n00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.050\nYou can see that I have\na basic white arrow.\n\n61\n00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.740\nThat means it doesn't really\nmean much of anything.\n\n62\n00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.408\nOkay?\nIt just means that if I click,\n\n63\n00:03:14.408 --> 00:03:15.852\nit's not gonna do anything.\n\n64\n00:03:15.852 --> 00:03:22.220\nBut if I move my mouse into that content\narea, you see my mouse turns to an I beam.\n\n65\n00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.320\nAn I beam always means text.\n\n66\n00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.464\nSo if I were to click right now,\nit would start and do text, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:30.464 --> 00:03:35.641\nAround those edges of those place holder\nor content boxes, my mouse turns into\n\n68\n00:03:35.641 --> 00:03:40.599\na four pointed arrow with an arrow on\ntop of it, with a regular white arrow.\n\n69\n00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.760\nThat indicates that you would be\nable to move that content area.\n\n70\n00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.640\nAnd here, I'm gonna zoom in for you.\n\n71\n00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.420\nSo if you're in this little area,\n\n72\n00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.960\nif I just move a little bit further up,\nthere's my white arrow.\n\n73\n00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.480\nLittle down, there's my four point arrow,\nlittle bit further down, I beam.\n\n74\n00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.810\nSo you can see in a very,\nvery small space, it can turn into\n\n75\n00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.750\nthree different mouse cursor icons that\ndo three completely different things.\n\n76\n00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.418\nSo just always be aware of it.\n\n77\n00:04:06.418 --> 00:04:12.130\nI always tell people, slow down, take\na breath, see what you're doing, okay?\n\n78\n00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.913\nSo, we're going to get out of zoom.\n\n79\n00:04:13.913 --> 00:04:17.814\nAnd with my I beam, I'm just gonna click\nand you can see that it activates that\n\n80\n00:04:17.814 --> 00:04:21.958\nparticular placeholder, and it allows me\nto type in, cuz I've got that flashing\n\n81\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.360\ncursor that says add text so\nI'm just gonna say Hello, for there.\n\n82\n00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.890\nAll right, perfect.\n\n83\n00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.290\nThroughout any of these Office shows, now\nspecifically since we're doing PowerPoint,\n\n84\n00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.210\nyou'll probably hear me say\na lot about just click off it,\n\n85\n00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.190\nlike just get out of it, just stop it.\n\n86\n00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.430\nThat means just find\nthat white arrow again.\n\n87\n00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.530\nJust find a blank space.\n\n88\n00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.160\nAnd if I click it, do you see how then it\ndeactivates that area that I was just in,\n\n89\n00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.370\nand now I'm just,\nI don't have anything selected, okay?\n\n90\n00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.778\nSo if I go ahead and\nclick to add a subtitle, we'll just say,\n\n91\n00:04:55.778 --> 00:04:57.862\nwhat should I say, Ronnie?\n\n92\n00:04:57.862 --> 00:04:59.780\n&gt;&gt; Say welcome to PowerPoint.\n\n93\n00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.192\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there we go [LAUGH].\n\n94\n00:05:01.192 --> 00:05:01.882\nHad a little like.\n\n95\n00:05:01.882 --> 00:05:03.468\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hm, what am I suppose to say?\n\n96\n00:05:03.468 --> 00:05:05.235\n[LAUGH].\nSo let's go ahead and say,\n\n97\n00:05:05.235 --> 00:05:07.200\nwell Hello Welcome to PowerPoint.\n\n98\n00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.101\nPerfect, that goes well together.\n\n99\n00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:11.548\nAll right, so I'm gonna click off,\nfind my white arrow.\n\n100\n00:05:11.548 --> 00:05:16.040\nBut notice, see if I move my,\nI didn't click off, just to show you that\n\n101\n00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.160\nif I had gone a little bit further up,\nthinking I'm clicking off,\n\n102\n00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.830\nbut I'm actually putting my I-beam\nback in that other placeholder area.\n\n103\n00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.730\nSo just notice that right out here,\nyou don't think you're\n\n104\n00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.660\nanywhere in an area that's in that\ncontent area, but you are, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.680\nSo, watch those mouse cursors,\nvery, very important.\n\n106\n00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.640\nAnd notice once I've actually put content\ninto those place holders, those little\n\n107\n00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.590\ndotted lines that were indicating to\nme this is a space that you can occupy.\n\n108\n00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.500\nThey're gone now.\n\n109\n00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.780\nWell, that's because we\nfilled that area in, so\n\n110\n00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.030\nnow I don't see those guidelines,\nif you want to say.\n\n111\n00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.610\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne, starting off with the idea\nof what you did there, where you\n\n112\n00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.940\nclicked on that blank presentation right\nat the beginning, is really beginning with\n\n113\n00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.370\na template which says,\nhere's how we think you should begin.\n\n114\n00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.290\nAnd this is very helpful because you\nmay not exactly know where to begin and\n\n115\n00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.210\nwhat to begin doing.\n\n116\n00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.840\nSo by doing this and having those\nparticular placeholders in place,\n\n117\n00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.370\nready to go, it at least gets\nyou a start in what you can do.\n\n118\n00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.540\nNow, Vonne, I know I wanna create\na presentation, but I only have one slide.\n\n119\n00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.310\nIs that gonna be my whole presentation?\n\n120\n00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.371\nWhat do I need to do next?\n\n121\n00:06:23.371 --> 00:06:27.517\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, I guess you could start\nwith one slide, but I'd have to say a lot.\n\n122\n00:06:27.517 --> 00:06:28.390\nAnd [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n123\n00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.271\n&gt;&gt; If we're just doing like a ten\n\n124\n00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:31.505\nminute presentation, or a ten second\npresentation, that might be good.\n\n125\n00:06:31.505 --> 00:06:34.074\nBut yeah,\nwe probably wanna add some slides in here.\n\n126\n00:06:34.074 --> 00:06:36.175\nSo how do we do that?\n\n127\n00:06:36.175 --> 00:06:38.580\nThere's a couple of different ways.\n\n128\n00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.460\nI think, right here on the Home\ntab that says New slide,\n\n129\n00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.930\nthat's a nice indication that\nI would like a new slide.\n\n130\n00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.735\nNow, two things to point out.\n\n131\n00:06:45.735 --> 00:06:48.550\nThere's a top part of that command,\n\n132\n00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.260\nand then there's a bottom part\nof that command, all right.\n\n133\n00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.550\nIf I just click the button part,\nnot the actual words that say New slide.\n\n134\n00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.480\nI click it, it will always\nadd the default next layout,\n\n135\n00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.250\nwhich is the layout called Title and\nContent.\n\n136\n00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.210\nYou can see that it's got a title and\n\n137\n00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.190\nthen an area where you're\nsupposed to add content.\n\n138\n00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:14.230\nThat will always be added when\nyou click that top button of\n\n139\n00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.140\nthis command right here.\n\n140\n00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.346\nSo again, back to that default\nlayout that it will always do.\n\n141\n00:07:19.346 --> 00:07:24.836\nBut if say, I wanted to add a new slide,\nbut I wanted a different layout,\n\n142\n00:07:24.836 --> 00:07:30.779\ncuz you saw in some of the example that\nwe did, we had different content areas.\n\n143\n00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:32.750\nIf you click the new slide underneath it.\n\n144\n00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.380\nYou see it drops down and\n\n145\n00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.030\nit gives you different layouts\nthat you can choose from.\n\n146\n00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.436\nSee there's our comparisons,\nwhere well, we wanna compare something.\n\n147\n00:07:42.436 --> 00:07:44.776\nThe To contact, the Title, and\nmaybe I just want it blank.\n\n148\n00:07:44.776 --> 00:07:49.717\nI don't even want any content\nplaceholders to start with.\n\n149\n00:07:49.717 --> 00:07:54.037\nSo you can see that all of these different\nlayouts determine how you want to organize\n\n150\n00:07:54.037 --> 00:07:57.180\nthe content within your slide,\nwhich is quite nice.\n\n151\n00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.050\nSo I'm just gonna pick To content,\njust to be different.\n\n152\n00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.403\nOkay?\nAnd you can see that, there you go.\n\n153\n00:08:01.403 --> 00:08:03.426\nWe still don't have anything in there.\n\n154\n00:08:03.426 --> 00:08:07.190\nBecause you can see it over here on\nthe left, like my slides are blank.\n\n155\n00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.740\nEven though to us It's like,\nhey double tap.\n\n156\n00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.760\nThat doesn't actually\nshow up on your slide.\n\n157\n00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:17.880\nIt's more of like a prompt from PowerPoint\nto say, hey this is what you can do.\n\n158\n00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:23.190\nSo, we're just adding blank slides\nwith different layouts along the way.\n\n159\n00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.790\nNow, those are our two main\nbuttons that you can do.\n\n160\n00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.805\nIf you wanted to a different\nway to add a slide,\n\n161\n00:08:28.805 --> 00:08:32.570\nremember those keyboard shortcuts\nthat I love to use, CTRL + M.\n\n162\n00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.800\nI'm not really sure where M is going\nto correlate with the new slide,\n\n163\n00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.730\nbut that's the keyboard shortcut.\n\n164\n00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.740\nThe other thing is like when you're\nworking you're in slide tab or\n\n165\n00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.770\nyou're slide pane, you can use your\n\n166\n00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:48.340\nright-click to access a lot of\nthe other features as well.\n\n167\n00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.238\nSo there is that other rule,\nwhen in doubt, right click.\n\n168\n00:08:51.238 --> 00:08:54.330\nRight, so\nremember those three rules, right?\n\n169\n00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:55.995\nHover to discover.\n\n170\n00:08:55.995 --> 00:08:58.008\nWhen in doubt right-click,\ngosh, I think I forgot them.\n\n171\n00:08:58.008 --> 00:09:00.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's right.\n\n172\n00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.400\nSo we have the hover to discover,\nselect to effect.\n\n173\n00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.100\nAnd when in doubt right click.\n\n174\n00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.100\nOr what was the other\none you used to say it?\n\n175\n00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.480\n&gt;&gt; Right click to fix.\n\n176\n00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.860\n&gt;&gt; And that rhymes a little bit better.\n\n177\n00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.990\nSo we'll go with that one.\n\n178\n00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.770\nBut the three basic rules of computers\nI always thought that was a fun little\n\n179\n00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:15.780\nditty to remember.\n\n180\n00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.600\nSo back in here, if I wanted another way,\n\n181\n00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.620\nlike I wonder what's gonna\nhappen,well right click on it okay?\n\n182\n00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.680\nCuz right click just brings\nup your contextual menu, so\n\n183\n00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.040\nyou can get different options, okay?\n\n184\n00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.590\nSo you could see that I right\nclicked on the slide and\n\n185\n00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.600\nI can do a whole bunch of\ndifferent things with this slide.\n\n186\n00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.670\nBut since we're talking about new slides,\n\n187\n00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.390\nlike adding that in,\nyou can see right there a new slide.\n\n188\n00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:43.618\nIf you're right clicking,\njust notice that if I right clicked in\n\n189\n00:09:43.618 --> 00:09:50.190\nlike a blank area not on a specific slide,\nit will give me the option for new slide.\n\n190\n00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:55.652\nBut you see I have a lot less\noptions because I'm not on a slide.\n\n191\n00:09:55.652 --> 00:09:59.458\nWhen I right click on a slide I'm gonna\nget all these different options that\n\n192\n00:09:59.458 --> 00:10:01.650\nare for that particular slide.\n\n193\n00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.312\nSo that's one thing to know.\n\n194\n00:10:03.312 --> 00:10:05.710\nAnd notice that of course\nif I do add a new slide,\n\n195\n00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:10.000\nit adds it back into whatever\nlayout I was last on.\n\n196\n00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.120\nCuz see it's adding those\ntwo content layouts.\n\n197\n00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.150\nAnd like well I thought the default\nadding of a slide was that title and\n\n198\n00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.660\ncontent layout.\n\n199\n00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.660\nWell that was because I was\nadding it from that section.\n\n200\n00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.350\nIf I click the button.\n\n201\n00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.930\nyou can see that it's\ngonna do the same thing.\n\n202\n00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:26.210\nSo wherever you were last\non it's going to add it.\n\n203\n00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.380\nSince the default one after\nthe title was content and layout.\n\n204\n00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.780\nThat's where it will\nalways add it that way.\n\n205\n00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.870\nSo anyways,\nI just wanted to point that out for you.\n\n206\n00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.090\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, if I continue to\nadd all these slides in here, so\n\n207\n00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:39.310\nyou've got several.\n\n208\n00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:42.820\nWhat if I realize I've added too many,\neven though I don't have any content?\n\n209\n00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.800\nHow do I get rid of this?\n\n210\n00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.010\n&gt;&gt; Again, right click is probably\nthe easiest way to do it.\n\n211\n00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:51.590\nIf you wanted to click on any\nof your slides, right click.\n\n212\n00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:55.540\nYou can see there is delete slide and\nthen it will go away.\n\n213\n00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:00.220\nThe other way is, since you have\nthe slide selected here, you can hit your\n\n214\n00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:04.000\ndelete key on your keyboard and\nthat will actually take it away.\n\n215\n00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.490\nAnd of course if you didn't like that,\nlike, whoops, I didn't wanna do that,\n\n216\n00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.030\nyou always have your undo.\n\n217\n00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.630\nSo you can always go\nbackwards if you need to.\n\n218\n00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:14.000\nBut, yeah, I usually use the keyboard,\nso I just delete the slides and\n\n219\n00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.312\nI can just go ahead and get rid of all of\nthose different slides, just like that.\n\n220\n00:11:18.312 --> 00:11:21.220\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, I thought I noticed,\nI wasn't sure I was in the right click\n\n221\n00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.700\nmenu or not, where it actually gave\nme a listing for duplicate a slide.\n\n222\n00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.610\nWhy would I choose to\ndo something like that?\n\n223\n00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:33.240\n&gt;&gt; I do that a lot, because maybe I wanna\ncontinue a slide with the same title, and\n\n224\n00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.440\nmaybe I formatted it at a specific way,\nand I don't wanna have to recreate it.\n\n225\n00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:36.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n226\n00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.990\nthat's always one reason,\nwhy I wanna do it.\n\n227\n00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.220\nSo, duplicating means exactly that.\n\n228\n00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.850\nYou're just going to take it,\nexactly how it is and make a copy.\n\n229\n00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.710\nSo if I right click on here,\nI'm gonna duplicate my title slide and\n\n230\n00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.950\nyou can see I have an exact\ncopy of that same one.\n\n231\n00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:55.330\nSo that's always a good\nway to duplicate and\n\n232\n00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.370\nnot to recreate stuff that\nyou don't want to do.\n\n233\n00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:03.200\nAnd if I don't like it,\nI can always delete it.\n\n234\n00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:09.540\nSo let's say add a slide, and yeah,\nlet's go ahead and add one just for now.\n\n235\n00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:14.065\nAnd I added it, but I didn't like\nthe layout that I chose, okay?\n\n236\n00:12:14.065 --> 00:12:16.740\nMaybe I didn't think enough of it,\n\n237\n00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:21.700\nI really wanted to do a picture with\ncaption or whatever type of layout.\n\n238\n00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.130\nAfter the fact,\nyou can come to the slide, and\n\n239\n00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.940\nthis little button right here you\ncan see that it gives you the option\n\n240\n00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.960\nto change the slide layout of whatever\nslide that you have selected.\n\n241\n00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.940\nSo if I want to say let's\nmake it a two content,\n\n242\n00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.580\nyou can see then it\nmakes it a two content.\n\n243\n00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.680\nBut when I go ahead and\nmake this into a content with caption,\n\n244\n00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.390\nthen I can go with content and\ncaption, and so on and so forth.\n\n245\n00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.700\nAnd that's actually even if\nyou have content in the slide.\n\n246\n00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.070\nSo for example, if I come back\nover to here to this title slide,\n\n247\n00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:51.970\nI already added content in it.\n\n248\n00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:55.720\nIf I change the layout from the title\nslide to title and content,\n\n249\n00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.770\nyou see it's going to adjust the\ninformation that's already on that slide\n\n250\n00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:04.270\ninto that layout that I have\nnow applied to the slide.\n\n251\n00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:08.290\nAnd if it's something basic like text,\nyou'll be okay.\n\n252\n00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.480\nBut if it's got a lot of complicated\nstuff like you have two contents or\n\n253\n00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.350\nmaybe a picture, it might not\nknow exactly what to do with it.\n\n254\n00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:19.980\nBut at least you won't delete the content\nof your slide if you change the layout.\n\n255\n00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:26.350\nIt just might look a little different,\nbut that's always a good thing to do.\n\n256\n00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:30.560\nSo let's go ahead and\nadd another slide just for fun.\n\n257\n00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.810\nSo we have a couple of slides in here.\n\n258\n00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:37.430\nNow I don't have a lot of content,\nso let me just go ahead and\n\n259\n00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:43.860\nreally quickly let's just go two,\njust to get some references in here.\n\n260\n00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:48.405\n[LAUGH] So I have one, two, three.\n\n261\n00:13:48.405 --> 00:13:51.089\nI have three slides in here.\n\n262\n00:13:51.089 --> 00:13:57.540\nMaybe I realized that slide three\nreally should go before slide two.\n\n263\n00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.160\nIt just doesn't flow the right way, so\n\n264\n00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.680\nI need to rearrange the order\nthat my slides are in.\n\n265\n00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.660\nThere's two ways,\nthere's probably a couple other ways but\n\n266\n00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.750\nthese are the two ways that\nI'm going to show you.\n\n267\n00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.210\nIs in the normal view that we have,\n\n268\n00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:14.460\nyou can just take the slide\nthat you want drag and drop.\n\n269\n00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.600\nOkay, so\nslide three will now become slide two.\n\n270\n00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.840\nClick, hold, drag up.\n\n271\n00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.320\nBut you gotta watch for\nwhere it actually does the movement.\n\n272\n00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.320\nIf you don't drag up high enough\nthen it doesn't do anything.\n\n273\n00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.992\nSo, by dragging it, that's where I\nwant you to go, you let go and then,\n\n274\n00:14:28.992 --> 00:14:32.084\n[SOUND] it drops in, and so\nnow I have hello, three, and two.\n\n275\n00:14:32.084 --> 00:14:33.850\nSo I've changed the order.\n\n276\n00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.000\nAnd that's fine, but\nif you have a large presentation and\n\n277\n00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.210\nmaybe you need to move slide 16 to spot 2.\n\n278\n00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:44.380\nSometimes if you want to go\ninto the slide sorter view.\n\n279\n00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.180\nHence why it calls it\nthe slide sorter view.\n\n280\n00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:46.940\nYou can do that.\n\n281\n00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.710\nSo I'm gonna go on the status\nbar down at the bottom.\n\n282\n00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.250\nAnd I'm gonna click this little button.\n\n283\n00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:54.570\nAgain, I could have gone to my view\ntab on the ribbon and gone that way.\n\n284\n00:14:54.570 --> 00:15:00.480\nYou can now see I can move this slide I\njust click hold and drag and go that way.\n\n285\n00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.686\nAlso if you're on your zoom\nthat was down below my head.\n\n286\n00:15:04.686 --> 00:15:09.146\nThen you can see if I had a lot slide\nyou can change that zoom level, so\n\n287\n00:15:09.146 --> 00:15:11.950\nthat way you can see a lot more slides.\n\n288\n00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:17.020\nAnd see slide 60 and slide 10 and I could\ngo ahead and drag and drop them that way.\n\n289\n00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.690\nSo that zoom on the status bar.\n\n290\n00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:23.040\nIt can be very helpful when you're\nback in this particular view and\n\n291\n00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.312\nyou can change them around.\n\n292\n00:15:24.312 --> 00:15:25.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Vonne.\n\n293\n00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:29.340\nI've noticed that the slides sorter view\nhas really helped me out in the past\n\n294\n00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:33.560\nwhen what I wanted to do even out\nof my own presentation to say,\n\n295\n00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.060\nI need to do a shortened version of\nthis and I can move those slides around\n\n296\n00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.400\nif I want to and that way I can\nactually create what I need to as well.\n\n297\n00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.790\nBut when you have a lot of slides and\nyou do need to make rearrangement\n\n298\n00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:47.950\nin your order, that slide sorter\nview is going to help you out a lot.\n\n299\n00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:52.606\nNow on that slide pane side though, it's\ngreat as long as you have enough room.\n\n300\n00:15:52.606 --> 00:15:55.987\nSo if you have a high resolution you\nmight get 10 or 15 slides over there but\n\n301\n00:15:55.987 --> 00:15:58.328\nif you have a low resolution\nyou might get 3 or 4, and\n\n302\n00:15:58.328 --> 00:16:01.836\nthat doesn't really help you out as much\nas you think that it would help you out.\n\n303\n00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:06.245\nSo the great thing is there's many\ndifferent tools To help us to be able to\n\n304\n00:16:06.245 --> 00:16:10.096\nadjust in terms of slide and\ncontent and the way that we want to.\n\n305\n00:16:10.096 --> 00:16:11.836\nAnd so being able to do this stuff and\n\n306\n00:16:11.836 --> 00:16:15.854\nunderstanding what's available to us is\ngonna help us to become more efficient.\n\n307\n00:16:15.854 --> 00:16:20.823\nThe other thing I like about this, Vonne,\nas well is that it also means I can kind\n\n308\n00:16:20.823 --> 00:16:25.590\nof free flow in my thought and thinking\nas I'm creating this presentation.\n\n309\n00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:28.380\nI don't always have to follow\nan outline right away.\n\n310\n00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.340\nI can just create different slides.\n\n311\n00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:34.160\nAnd then I can go back on that slide\nsorter view, and put them into the right\n\n312\n00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.110\norder, once I've kind of come up\nwith everything that I needed to.\n\n313\n00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:39.160\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's like you put\nyour thoughts down on paper, and\n\n314\n00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.070\nyou can move around.\n\n315\n00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.570\nI actually ended up making some\nof the content for these lessons,\n\n316\n00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.530\ncuz I was like, no,\nI should really talk about this first.\n\n317\n00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.920\nI thought it was gonna be that way,\nso, it's really great.\n\n318\n00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.820\nAnd it's just drag and\ndrop, and it's awesome.\n\n319\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:57.250\nSo, the one thing that I did want to cover\nbefore we wrap it up is Reset Slide.\n\n320\n00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:02.370\nBecause I was showing you how you could\nchange the layout of a selected slide.\n\n321\n00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:05.710\nLike this first one, we started with\nthe slide layout as the Title and\n\n322\n00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:10.650\nContent or the title slide, but then I\nwent to the title and a content, okay?\n\n323\n00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:15.420\nAnd that was where it’s not affecting the\ninformation on the slide just the layout.\n\n324\n00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.680\nWell, the other button\nthat is in here is Reset.\n\n325\n00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.990\nNow, if I click this right now,\nit’s not gonna do anything.\n\n326\n00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.985\nYou’re like okay well.\n\n327\n00:17:21.985 --> 00:17:23.325\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What’s the point of this?\n\n328\n00:17:23.325 --> 00:17:26.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I wanted to just quickly demonstrate\n\n329\n00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:29.860\nit, so, I’m gonna get into some things\nthat will cover it in a lot more\n\n330\n00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:30.840\ndetail later.\n\n331\n00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.120\nI'm gonna change this back\nto the title slide layout.\n\n332\n00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.560\nI'm going to click it with my eye beam,\njust so I can get a reference point as to\n\n333\n00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:43.980\nwhere the boundaries of that content area,\nor that placeholder lives,\n\n334\n00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.010\nand this also brings up one other\npoint that we haven't covered yet.\n\n335\n00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.360\nWe now have a contextual\ntab on our ribbon.\n\n336\n00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.890\nOkay which is like what?\n\n337\n00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:51.690\nIt's right up here.\n\n338\n00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.870\nSo you see we just did not have\na format tab on the ribbon,\n\n339\n00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:58.230\nwe always had it on the other one.\n\n340\n00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:03.260\nThis only comes up on the ribbon\nwhen you are clicked on or\n\n341\n00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:09.290\nactivated something in your environment\nthat lead to give you more options.\n\n342\n00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:12.520\nSo let me click off and\nsee if my format tab goes away.\n\n343\n00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.740\nClick here again,\nnow it's in the drawing tools because\n\n344\n00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:20.770\nreally PowerPoint sees\neverything like a shape or\n\n345\n00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:27.200\nsomething that can be formatted cuz\nit's a graphical element, okay?\n\n346\n00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.710\nSo, while my cursor is in this content\nbox, if I click on that Format tab,\n\n347\n00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.610\nyou can see I have some different things\nthat i could do within this area and\n\n348\n00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.890\none of the first things I want to\nshow you just the shape fills.\n\n349\n00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.420\nSo I'm gonna make this orange,\nokay, that sounds great.\n\n350\n00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:45.485\nIf I click down on Welcome to PowerPoint,\nbecause I want to activate the sub title.\n\n351\n00:18:45.485 --> 00:18:49.240\nLet's change the fill to blue,\njust for fun.\n\n352\n00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:55.530\nSo now I can see the actual areas\nof this place holder content box.\n\n353\n00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.920\nAll right, I'm gonna go over\nto the four pointed arrow.\n\n354\n00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.200\nCuz remember four point\narrow means two things.\n\n355\n00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:07.770\nIt's going to mean move but it also means\nthat I want to select the whole box,\n\n356\n00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.750\nnot the I beam where I'm\ngoing in to select the text.\n\n357\n00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.080\nSo if I click here,\n\n358\n00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.380\nI've selected this content area and\nI'm just gonna resize this for now.\n\n359\n00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.230\nMaybe move it around, and then I'm gonna\nclick here, and that's just with the two\n\n360\n00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:23.700\npointer arrows, which we'll cover more,\nand I'm gonna move it over here.\n\n361\n00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.420\nSo I have changed the slide.\n\n362\n00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:31.134\nBut that's not looking so\ngreat as, well it's not that great.\n\n363\n00:19:31.134 --> 00:19:35.760\n[LAUGH] So I want to reset this slide.\n\n364\n00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.120\nWell let's click and\nsee what that button does.\n\n365\n00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.790\nIt did exactly that,\nit did not delete my content.\n\n366\n00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:44.839\nIt reset the slide to any\nformatting that you had done and\n\n367\n00:19:44.839 --> 00:19:47.855\nset it back to the default positioning and\n\n368\n00:19:47.855 --> 00:19:52.542\nplacement of those placeholder boxes so\nit can be really handy.\n\n369\n00:19:52.542 --> 00:19:56.670\nIt's like let's start over,\nbut not completely over.\n\n370\n00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.350\nI'm not deleting anything.\n\n371\n00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:02.460\nI'm just putting the slide back\nto the way it was by default,\n\n372\n00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:06.470\nwhich can be very, very handy,\nso I like that one.\n\n373\n00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.480\nAnd the last little button\nthat's in this slides\n\n374\n00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.090\ngroup within the home tab\nis this little button.\n\n375\n00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.000\nThis is our section, so\nsections are really just for\n\n376\n00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.567\nyou to mark different areas of your slide\npresentation of like well this is the time\n\n377\n00:20:20.567 --> 00:20:22.633\nwhere I'm gonna talk about my cats.\n\n378\n00:20:22.633 --> 00:20:26.670\nAnd this is gonna be the slides that\ncover sunsets or what have you.\n\n379\n00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:30.649\nI'm on slide one, so if I click on\nAdd Section, notice that you do have\n\n380\n00:20:30.649 --> 00:20:35.168\nto make one consideration of like where do\nI want to be when I add this section, so\n\n381\n00:20:35.168 --> 00:20:37.810\nalways think about that first.\n\n382\n00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.974\nI'm on slide one, so\nI'll add a section and\n\n383\n00:20:39.974 --> 00:20:42.617\nI'm gonna say here we go\nhere is an untitled section.\n\n384\n00:20:42.617 --> 00:20:46.539\nIt just automatically added it to that and\non top of,\n\n385\n00:20:46.539 --> 00:20:50.600\non the front of the slide\nthat I had selected.\n\n386\n00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.860\nNotice that it does,\nwhen I click on the section name,\n\n387\n00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.660\nit highlights all the slides.\n\n388\n00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:58.390\nCuz maybe I want to format\nall of these slides at once.\n\n389\n00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.860\nMaybe make different changes\nto the font or what have you.\n\n390\n00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.440\nSo that's another nice thing about adding\nsections is it's a quick way to select\n\n391\n00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.600\nmultiple slides at once.\n\n392\n00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.060\nBut untitled is not very descriptive.\n\n393\n00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:13.240\nSo if you right-click on that untitled\nsection, you can then rename it.\n\n394\n00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.928\nSo we can say Beginning.\n\n395\n00:21:15.928 --> 00:21:17.432\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n396\n00:21:17.432 --> 00:21:19.610\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like a good one.\n\n397\n00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.550\nAll right, so\nnow I have the beginning section.\n\n398\n00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:26.490\nAnd maybe starting at slide three,\nit's going to start a new section.\n\n399\n00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:30.360\nSo you could also\nright-click on this slide.\n\n400\n00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.470\nSo we can go ahead and say Add a Section,\nand then it adds it, but\n\n401\n00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:38.560\nthen we have to back,\nright-click on the section and rename it.\n\n402\n00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.910\nSo then we'll name this 3.\n\n403\n00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:43.176\nBecause I can't think of anything\nelse creatively to name it.\n\n404\n00:21:43.176 --> 00:21:48.048\nSo now I have these different sections\nwhich can be really great for\n\n405\n00:21:48.048 --> 00:21:50.150\norganizing it.\n\n406\n00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:53.575\nAnd then if you ever wanted for\nsome reason to delete the section,\n\n407\n00:21:53.575 --> 00:21:56.076\nlike that's just not working or\nwhat have you.\n\n408\n00:21:56.076 --> 00:22:00.819\nYou can then notice that you can remove\nthe section, but now, remove the section\n\n409\n00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:04.750\nand the slides, you might not\nwanna do that, well, maybe you do.\n\n410\n00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.320\nBut at least it gives you that option,\nokay?\n\n411\n00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:11.350\nSo it's just organizing slides\ninto sections that you can do.\n\n412\n00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:12.570\nYou can also collapse.\n\n413\n00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:16.560\nThink about if you had ten slides in one\nsection and ten slides in another and\n\n414\n00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.270\nyou realized all those ten slides need\nto go in front of these ten slides.\n\n415\n00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:24.952\nThat's a nice way to where you could\ncollapse them down and then you can drag\n\n416\n00:22:24.952 --> 00:22:29.187\nand drop your sections the same way\nthat you were resorting slides,\n\n417\n00:22:29.187 --> 00:22:30.841\nyou can resort sections.\n\n418\n00:22:30.841 --> 00:22:34.916\nSo think about moving large chunks\nof multiple slides at one time,\n\n419\n00:22:34.916 --> 00:22:39.140\nthat can be way easier than moving\nin all the individual slides.\n\n420\n00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.150\nSo that can be really,\nreally handy and I think\n\n421\n00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:46.850\nthat's a great way to organize your\nslides and a great place to stop, maybe.\n\n422\n00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:51.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the idea of using sections\nreally does seem very powerful.\n\n423\n00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:55.470\nSuch as if you just wanted to show a\nportion as well during your presentation,\n\n424\n00:22:55.470 --> 00:23:01.740\nwhich I'm pretty sure Vonne will\nget a little bit later on as well.\n\n425\n00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.310\nWhere instead, you can kind of\ncreate a custom slide show and\n\n426\n00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:05.510\njust name that section.\n\n427\n00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:08.900\nAnd be able to only show those without\nhaving to delete everything out, and\n\n428\n00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.620\ndo everything that you need to as well.\n\n429\n00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:14.080\nSo, the idea of working with\nmultiple slides is very important,\n\n430\n00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.170\nbecause most slide shows are not\ngonna be just a single slide.\n\n431\n00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:20.020\nThe great thing is PowerPoint\nhelps us out by providing\n\n432\n00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.200\nthe ability to add in those\ncontent sections that we need to.\n\n433\n00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.550\nTo help us get started.\n\n434\n00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:26.100\nA lot of times it's very difficult.\n\n435\n00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.351\nIt's intimidating to get started\nwith just a blank piece of paper or\n\n436\n00:23:29.351 --> 00:23:31.930\na blank slide and go all right,\nmake a presentation.\n\n437\n00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.840\nBut by helping us out we know exactly\nwhat we need to add in and maybe at\n\n438\n00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.212\nthat point our creativity will begin to\nflow or our content will begin to flow or\n\n439\n00:23:38.212 --> 00:23:41.245\nour content will begin to flow\nthe way that we need to as well.\n\n440\n00:23:41.245 --> 00:23:43.030\nVonne has just demonstrated,\nof course then,\n\n441\n00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:47.470\nhow do we get that into PowerPoint and\nthen we can see how to manipulate that and\n\n442\n00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:51.190\nchange it around in what's going to make\na very effective PowerPoint presentation.\n\n443\n00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.430\nSo Vonne, thank you again for\nhelping us out here.\n\n444\n00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.720\nAnd thank you also for watching.\n\n445\n00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.260\nThis is a great place for\nus to sign off then.\n\n446\n00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.830\nFor ITPRO.TV I've been\nyour host Ronnie Wong.\n\n447\n00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:01.920\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n448\n00:24:01.920 -->

00:00:12.241\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:15.313\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:15.313 --> 00:00:16.980\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.576\nAnd today you're watching\nMicrosoft PowerPoint 2016.\n\n7\n00:00:20.576 --> 00:00:23.119\nAnd here to help us out is\ngoing to be Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.409\nAs she helps us to get\nstarted in working with text.\n\n9\n00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:31.117\nVonne, where are we going to begin today\nwhen we take a look at working with text?\n\n10\n00:00:31.117 --> 00:00:33.856\n&gt;&gt; We're going to be adding\nthem into our slides.\n\n11\n00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:37.760\nSo [LAUGH] we're gonna add our\ncontent into our placeholder text.\n\n12\n00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.390\nWe're going to go over adding our lists,\nbecause when we're giving a presentation,\n\n13\n00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.130\nwe don't always want to\nput in full paragraphs.\n\n14\n00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.720\nNow I think every slide show has\nit's purpose and it's place and\n\n15\n00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.610\nit's audience for\nwhat you're trying to do.\n\n16\n00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.060\nBut large amounts of text, you probably\naren't gonna necessarily add to a slide.\n\n17\n00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.450\nSo a lot of it you want to display\nit like your main points in there.\n\n18\n00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.860\nSo is going to be in usually\na form of a bulleted list.\n\n19\n00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.120\nSo we're going to go over\nadding the text to a list.\n\n20\n00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.838\nWe're also going to do some fun stuff with\nauto correct options and some spelling and\n\n21\n00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:13.640\nit's gonna be a grand old time.\n\n22\n00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.370\nSo and I might need you help there Ronnie,\n\n23\n00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.446\nbecause I'm gonna need\na add some information and\n\n24\n00:01:17.446 --> 00:01:20.376\nI'm going to need your help of what\nwe're gonna actually talk about.\n\n25\n00:01:20.376 --> 00:01:23.347\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That sounds good Vonne, so\n\n26\n00:01:23.347 --> 00:01:28.870\nif we start taking a look then if if we\nwant to begin our PowerPoint correctly.\n\n27\n00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.990\nWe do, we need to at least pick a subject,\nright?\n\n28\n00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.866\nSo, let's let's think about\nwhat we want to talk about.\n\n29\n00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:36.578\nVonne I know that you like cats,\n\n30\n00:01:36.578 --> 00:01:41.610\nI know that you like hockey,\nI know that you like boy bands.\n\n31\n00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.499\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna put my vote in for cats or\n\n32\n00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:49.417\nhockey, but Vonne, I'll let you\nmake the ultimate decision here.\n\n33\n00:01:49.417 --> 00:01:50.734\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know what?\n\n34\n00:01:50.734 --> 00:01:52.191\nWe should probably talk about cats.\n\n35\n00:01:52.191 --> 00:01:55.125\nWhen I start talking about hockey\nI might get a little animated and\n\n36\n00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:57.967\na little spirited and\nwho knows what's gonna come flying out.\n\n37\n00:01:57.967 --> 00:01:58.773\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n38\n00:01:58.773 --> 00:01:59.848\n&gt;&gt; Let's talk about cats.\n\n39\n00:01:59.848 --> 00:02:02.724\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, if this is about boy bands\nwe know that you're definitely gonna get\n\n40\n00:02:02.724 --> 00:02:03.456\nanimated there so.\n\n41\n00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:07.019\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's use the idea of cats here.\n\n42\n00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:10.969\n[CROSSTALK] All right Vonne so\nwhere are we gonna begin?\n\n43\n00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:15.240\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, so I actually have a slide\nshow already started, or a presentation.\n\n44\n00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.150\nI just started a new blank slide.\n\n45\n00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.160\nSo we're going to tap to add a title.\n\n46\n00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.560\nCuz we did go over that already.\n\n47\n00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.545\nWe're just going to click it and type it.\n\n48\n00:02:22.545 --> 00:02:24.403\nSo we're gonna type Cats.\n\n49\n00:02:24.403 --> 00:02:25.249\n&gt;&gt; Cats.\n\n50\n00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:26.461\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's real original, I like it.\n\n51\n00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:27.074\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n52\n00:02:27.074 --> 00:02:30.564\nAnd we're going to just say.\n\n53\n00:02:30.564 --> 00:02:32.242\n&gt;&gt; My cats?\n\n54\n00:02:32.242 --> 00:02:33.076\nVonne's cats.\n\n55\n00:02:33.076 --> 00:02:34.363\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna say Vonne and Ronnie.\n\n56\n00:02:34.363 --> 00:02:35.417\n&gt;&gt; There we go, we're cats now, great.\n\n57\n00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:36.335\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n58\n00:02:36.335 --> 00:02:41.131\nSo just to point out really\nquickly that red squiggly?\n\n59\n00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:42.014\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n60\n00:02:42.014 --> 00:02:43.069\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n61\n00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.573\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n62\n00:02:43.573 --> 00:02:44.333\n&gt;&gt; The program likes you.\n\n63\n00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:46.527\nIt doesn't like me too much, right?\n\n64\n00:02:46.527 --> 00:02:48.965\nThat just indicates I have\na misspelled word, and\n\n65\n00:02:48.965 --> 00:02:51.062\nthat's always gonna happen with my name.\n\n66\n00:02:51.062 --> 00:02:54.478\n[LAUGH] But we'll get back to\nwhat that means how we can fix it\n\n67\n00:02:54.478 --> 00:02:59.038\nafter we add another slide and start\ngetting some more information about it.\n\n68\n00:02:59.038 --> 00:03:02.613\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nadd a slide I'm going to add a title and\n\n69\n00:03:02.613 --> 00:03:06.260\ncontent and I'm just using that drop\ndown so you can see what I'm doing.\n\n70\n00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.450\nSo here we go.\n\n71\n00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.574\nAnd we're gonna add a title.\n\n72\n00:03:08.574 --> 00:03:11.060\nWhat should the title of this slide be,\nRonnie?\n\n73\n00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.094\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Since we're talking about\ncats here, and it's about you and me.\n\n74\n00:03:16.094 --> 00:03:17.795\nWe have a couple of choices, right?\n\n75\n00:03:17.795 --> 00:03:21.677\nWe can either do a group\nthing about the owners, or\n\n76\n00:03:21.677 --> 00:03:27.977\nwe can talk about the environment that\nthe cats are in, which one would you like?\n\n77\n00:03:27.977 --> 00:03:30.605\n&gt;&gt; How about we do our cats,\nbecause I'm sure we've probably had\n\n78\n00:03:30.605 --> 00:03:32.745\na couple iterations of\ncats throughout the years.\n\n79\n00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:37.953\n[LAUGH] So we'll say Our Cats,\nall right, so I've added our title.\n\n80\n00:03:37.953 --> 00:03:41.101\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna click here to add my text.\n\n81\n00:03:41.101 --> 00:03:45.617\nAnd notice as soon as I click in here,\nit's kinda gray, but there is a bullet\n\n82\n00:03:45.617 --> 00:03:50.920\npoint there, so we're actually going\nto be doing or starting our list, okay?\n\n83\n00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.720\nSo I'm just gonna make up something like,\nlet's\n\n84\n00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.730\ntalk about, now you're all watching me\ntype, and I'm not gonna type right at all.\n\n85\n00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.110\nLet's talk about cats, all right.\n\n86\n00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.556\nJust to get that first bullet point in.\n\n87\n00:04:06.556 --> 00:04:10.867\nNow if I Enter,\nI'm making another bullet point.\n\n88\n00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:14.679\nSo I have to say let's have a new\nparagraph, because I am hitting Enter.\n\n89\n00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:16.546\nSo, what I'd like to do.\n\n90\n00:04:16.546 --> 00:04:21.589\nWhy don't we go ahead and I'll talk\nabout my cats first, and then we'll talk\n\n91\n00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:26.420\nabout yours, because that way we can\nshow our different levels of lists.\n\n92\n00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.498\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nput my name in there.\n\n93\n00:04:29.498 --> 00:04:30.970\nNow, I wanna go ahead and\n\n94\n00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.344\ngo through the different names\nof my cats that I have had.\n\n95\n00:04:34.344 --> 00:04:35.267\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n96\n00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:38.125\n&gt;&gt; But if I hit Enter it's\non the same level, right?\n\n97\n00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:39.123\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n98\n00:04:39.123 --> 00:04:41.851\n&gt;&gt; But I want to say, well,\nthe cats that I've had.\n\n99\n00:04:41.851 --> 00:04:43.429\nSo they need to be underneath me.\n\n100\n00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:46.906\nIf you wanna say, so\nthat's where you can indent.\n\n101\n00:04:46.906 --> 00:04:47.979\nWell, it's not actually indenting.\n\n102\n00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.115\nIt's demoting, right?\n\n103\n00:04:50.115 --> 00:04:51.422\nYeah, we're indenting.\n\n104\n00:04:51.422 --> 00:04:54.982\nWe making, I call it a sublist.\n\n105\n00:04:54.982 --> 00:04:58.804\nOkay, so the easiest way to do\nthis is to hit the Tab key.\n\n106\n00:04:58.804 --> 00:05:03.678\nIf you hit the Tab key, you see how it\ngoes ahead and indents my bullet level.\n\n107\n00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:06.051\nI think that's the easiest way to do it.\n\n108\n00:05:06.051 --> 00:05:09.809\nYou can always come up to these\ndifferent increase and decrease.\n\n109\n00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:10.707\nThat's what they call them.\n\n110\n00:05:10.707 --> 00:05:11.746\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n111\n00:05:11.746 --> 00:05:14.509\nyou can see that if I hit the decrease,\nit's going to go back out.\n\n112\n00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:15.834\nIf I hit the increase.\n\n113\n00:05:15.834 --> 00:05:18.349\nBut while I'm typing,\nI just think it's easier for\n\n114\n00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:19.957\nme to just keep on going, right?\n\n115\n00:05:19.957 --> 00:05:25.828\nSo let's go with my current cats, which\nare Fuego, okay, that's the first one.\n\n116\n00:05:25.828 --> 00:05:30.098\nNow notice since I am indented in\nthis sub list, if I hit Enter,\n\n117\n00:05:30.098 --> 00:05:32.932\nit's going to keep me on that same level.\n\n118\n00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:35.771\nSo then I could go ahead and\ntype in Bishop.\n\n119\n00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:37.487\nThose are my two cats, okay?\n\n120\n00:05:37.487 --> 00:05:38.488\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n121\n00:05:38.488 --> 00:05:41.864\n&gt;&gt; Now if I hit Enter again,\nI'm still on that same level.\n\n122\n00:05:41.864 --> 00:05:46.345\nBut what I'd really like to do is add a\nnew main topic, which would be your cats.\n\n123\n00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:47.306\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n124\n00:05:47.306 --> 00:05:49.690\n&gt;&gt; So I wanna type in Ronnie, but\nI don't want to be in this area.\n\n125\n00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.870\nSo if I can tab to get in,\nShift+Tab is how you can get out.\n\n126\n00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.250\nSo again, since I'm already typing,\nI'm gonna throw you out those shortcuts.\n\n127\n00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.740\nSo I hold my Shift and\nI click the Tab key and\n\n128\n00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.060\nyou see how that like decreases or\ntakes me out?\n\n129\n00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.342\nSo Tab goes in, and I'm going quite a few.\n\n130\n00:06:06.342 --> 00:06:10.620\nShift+Tab gets out, so\nI'm clicking those buttons as each time.\n\n131\n00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.670\nSo, here we are, so\nnow I'm back out to my main level.\n\n132\n00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.580\nSo we'll go ahead and\nsay Ronnie it's your turn.\n\n133\n00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.387\nWhat do we got?\n\n134\n00:06:17.387 --> 00:06:20.552\nSo I have Enter hit the Tab.\n\n135\n00:06:20.552 --> 00:06:21.778\nWhat are your Cats?\n\n136\n00:06:21.778 --> 00:06:24.642\n&gt;&gt; One is, I know that everyone's\ngonna laugh at this name,\n\n137\n00:06:24.642 --> 00:06:26.168\nit's Tubby Buttercup [LAUGH].\n\n138\n00:06:26.168 --> 00:06:27.968\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I did not name these cats,\n\n139\n00:06:27.968 --> 00:06:29.154\nmy daughter named these.\n\n140\n00:06:29.154 --> 00:06:32.028\n&gt;&gt; I was about to say,\nthat's definitely your daughter, isn't it?\n\n141\n00:06:32.028 --> 00:06:33.475\nTabby but, I think it's adorable.\n\n142\n00:06:33.475 --> 00:06:34.789\n&gt;&gt; It is, yeah.\n\n143\n00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:39.071\nAnd then the other one\nis Sprinkle Cupcake.\n\n144\n00:06:39.071 --> 00:06:41.770\nShe named them when she was like four.\n\n145\n00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:42.450\n&gt;&gt; These are amazing.\n\n146\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.515\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's our cats.\n\n147\n00:06:46.515 --> 00:06:50.630\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful, well thank you for\nhelping me with that content.\n\n148\n00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.120\n&gt;&gt; Kind of embarrassing now.\n\n149\n00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.426\n&gt;&gt; I think it's great.\n\n150\n00:06:53.426 --> 00:06:55.100\n[LAUGH] All right, wonderful.\n\n151\n00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.490\nSo you can see that we're demonstrating\nhere how to put in our list items.\n\n152\n00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:05.018\nHow to indent and outdent as I call it,\nincrease decrease however you wanna say\n\n153\n00:07:05.018 --> 00:07:10.997\nit, we're making our different levels of\nour list using our fun little shortcuts.\n\n154\n00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:13.977\nAll right, so\nlet's just add some other things.\n\n155\n00:07:13.977 --> 00:07:15.677\nWe're just gonna make up some people now.\n\n156\n00:07:15.677 --> 00:07:18.162\nActually, I know Tim has some cats.\n\n157\n00:07:18.162 --> 00:07:18.995\n&gt;&gt; Does he?\n\n158\n00:07:18.995 --> 00:07:20.754\nI don't know what their names are.\n\n159\n00:07:20.754 --> 00:07:22.607\n&gt;&gt; Well, I know the name of his dog.\n\n160\n00:07:22.607 --> 00:07:24.471\nSo we'll just go with that.\n\n161\n00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:28.090\n[LAUGH] His name is Tito, it was Brantley.\n\n162\n00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:29.347\nThat's what it was.\n\n163\n00:07:29.347 --> 00:07:31.694\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the name of his cat so.\n\n164\n00:07:31.694 --> 00:07:32.666\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Now as you can see,\n\n165\n00:07:32.666 --> 00:07:33.730\nI don't know if you noticed.\n\n166\n00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.930\nAs soon as I started adding\na lot of content in it, see,\n\n167\n00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:43.070\nlet's just say he has another one\ncalled Princess, just making that up.\n\n168\n00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:48.590\nAnd I hit Enter, do you see how\nif I keep on adding and prints?\n\n169\n00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:54.397\nNotice how it just condensed up my text\nbecause that's what PowerPoint is doing,\n\n170\n00:07:54.397 --> 00:07:56.849\nis doing this auto sizing option.\n\n171\n00:07:56.849 --> 00:08:00.580\nOkay, it's saying, you're adding\nquite a few things on here, so\n\n172\n00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.531\nI wanna make sure I get in\nthat same Place holder area.\n\n173\n00:08:03.531 --> 00:08:08.720\nSo I'm just gonna automatically\nresize the text to fit in there.\n\n174\n00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.235\nSo if I were to keep on adding,\nI'm just naming people that I know.\n\n175\n00:08:13.235 --> 00:08:16.640\n[LAUGH] So you can see, Cherokee,\n\n176\n00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:22.270\nyou can see it's just gonna keep\non adding every time I type in.\n\n177\n00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.353\nI'm gonna undo those last couple Bobs.\n\n178\n00:08:26.353 --> 00:08:30.252\nOkay, so there you go.\n\n179\n00:08:30.252 --> 00:08:33.530\nAll right, now that could be\na good thing or a bad thing.\n\n180\n00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:38.610\nI like that, but notice that you get\nthis little guy right down here.\n\n181\n00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.518\nThis is our introduction to smart tags.\n\n182\n00:08:40.518 --> 00:08:44.496\nSmart tags, while at first, I remember\nwhen they first came up like years and\n\n183\n00:08:44.496 --> 00:08:45.120\nyears ago.\n\n184\n00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.710\nI was like these things are so annoying.\n\n185\n00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:47.710\nWhy are they?\n\n186\n00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.550\nThey're amazing, okay, they give you so\nmany new options and so\n\n187\n00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.100\nmany things that you could do.\n\n188\n00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.660\nAnd it smartly pops up when ever\nit thinks that it's necessary.\n\n189\n00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:01.040\nSo if I click on this,\nsee it's doing that auto fit options, and\n\n190\n00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.950\nif I click it's selected on like yes,\nI'm going to auto fit that text.\n\n191\n00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:07.710\nOr if you're like,\nI don't want you to do that,\n\n192\n00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.650\ncuz I don't want you to\nchange the font size.\n\n193\n00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:14.130\nYou could say Stop, but\nthen it wouldn't fit, okay?\n\n194\n00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.090\nBut the other nice thing is that, and\nthese are some of the newer ones that I\n\n195\n00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.790\ndon't remember seeing until\nin our newer versions.\n\n196\n00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:24.110\nSplit text between two slides, continue\non a new slide or change it to columns.\n\n197\n00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:29.800\nSo it's giving you options of\ndifferent ways that you can control\n\n198\n00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.840\nthe amount of texts that you're\nputting in this text slide.\n\n199\n00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.064\nSo, if I click on,\nI like the split between two slides.\n\n200\n00:09:36.064 --> 00:09:40.459\nSo, if you do that, you can see that it\ntook all that content that I've started\n\n201\n00:09:40.459 --> 00:09:43.921\non slide two, and\nthen it just found it's breaking point, or\n\n202\n00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:47.873\nthe halfway point if you wanna say,\nand it split it across two slides.\n\n203\n00:09:47.873 --> 00:09:52.508\nWhich is really, really handy cuz if\nyou're just kinda typing and going along,\n\n204\n00:09:52.508 --> 00:09:54.130\nI really like that option.\n\n205\n00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:59.900\nBecause they say, again,\nthis is kind of those rules that,\n\n206\n00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.720\ndepending on your audience,\nwhether you break them or adhere to them,\n\n207\n00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.650\nyou don't wanna put more than five bullet\npoints, or five points on a slide.\n\n208\n00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.320\nIf you have eight things to talk about,\ndivide them up into two slides.\n\n209\n00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.050\nGo ahead and put four on one slide and\nfour on another and\n\n210\n00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.780\nit just makes it flow a little bit better.\n\n211\n00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.570\nThinking about people reading your slides.\n\n212\n00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.350\nYou don't want them to\ndo that necessarily.\n\n213\n00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.775\nSo that's kind of a nice little tip and\n\n214\n00:10:23.775 --> 00:10:27.870\nPowerPoint is helping you do\nthat which is pretty nice.\n\n215\n00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.420\nSo I'm on slide three.\n\n216\n00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.690\nWhat I want to go over next,\nkinda going along that autoing features?\n\n217\n00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.310\n&gt;&gt; Auto fit.\n&gt;&gt; I don't think autoing is a word but\n\n218\n00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.150\nI like to make up a lot of words.\n\n219\n00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.120\nThe same auto features\nthat were in PowerPoint,\n\n220\n00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.600\nwe're in PowerPoint, is doing for us.\n\n221\n00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.690\nLet's just go ahead and\nshow you how they work.\n\n222\n00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:51.827\nI'm going to add another slide so\nwe're going to go here and\n\n223\n00:10:51.827 --> 00:10:54.818\nwe're just going to go with AutoCorrect.\n\n224\n00:10:54.818 --> 00:10:56.045\nThat sounds like a nice title.\n\n225\n00:10:56.045 --> 00:10:58.345\nAll right, so I'm going to click here and\n\n226\n00:10:58.345 --> 00:11:02.770\none the first thing is that PowerPoint\ndoes it's going to automatically\n\n227\n00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:08.580\ncapitalise your first word of your\nsentence or bullet in the sense.\n\n228\n00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:14.260\nSo if I just type in Hello,\nbut not capitalizing the h.\n\n229\n00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.747\nAnd I hit the Space bar because\nI'm actually, like I do anything.\n\n230\n00:11:16.747 --> 00:11:19.066\nHit the Space button and\nthen it automatically does that.\n\n231\n00:11:19.066 --> 00:11:20.720\nIt's like well that's nice.\n\n232\n00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.390\nAnd sometimes I've gotten so used to it,\n\n233\n00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:27.120\ndoing that I actually forget to hold\nthe Shift key and capitalize the letters.\n\n234\n00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.301\nOkay, so that's kind of nice.\n\n235\n00:11:29.301 --> 00:11:35.258\nAnother thing that it will do\nis do what are called ordinals.\n\n236\n00:11:35.258 --> 00:11:35.862\nOkay, like what's an ordinal?\n\n237\n00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.260\n&gt;&gt; Ordinals.\n&gt;&gt; I'll show you.\n\n238\n00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:37.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n239\n00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:43.560\n&gt;&gt; This is the first,\nyou see as soon as I click off or\n\n240\n00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.790\nspace after the ST in the first,\nthat's actually an ordinal.\n\n241\n00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.610\nThere's a whole bunch of\nthings in typography.\n\n242\n00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.940\nThere's ordinals and\nligatures and swashes.\n\n243\n00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.230\nI could talk about typography for hours.\n\n244\n00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.088\nBut I'm just gonna leave it\nas it does some nice auto\n\n245\n00:12:01.088 --> 00:12:05.048\ncorrections here with our\nordinals in PowerPoint.\n\n246\n00:12:05.048 --> 00:12:07.789\nOrdinals, the other thing it\ndoes is contractions, okay?\n\n247\n00:12:07.789 --> 00:12:10.298\nNow this isn't actually\na flowing sentence.\n\n248\n00:12:10.298 --> 00:12:14.765\nBut if I said C-A-N-T.\n\n249\n00:12:14.765 --> 00:12:15.510\nWell, that didn't do it.\n\n250\n00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.430\nHow about doesn't.\n\n251\n00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.207\nThere we go okay that's the one.\n\n252\n00:12:19.207 --> 00:12:24.125\nIt didn't understand the can't\nlike I can't do this but\n\n253\n00:12:24.125 --> 00:12:27.207\nit doesn't it will, it does that.\n\n254\n00:12:27.207 --> 00:12:27.848\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n255\n00:12:27.848 --> 00:12:31.484\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's going to give\nus such as auto contractions and\n\n256\n00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:36.870\nthings like that which is really nice\nif that's what she wanted to do.\n\n257\n00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:37.946\nThink you can already tell.\n\n258\n00:12:37.946 --> 00:12:40.242\nI'm gonna get to where like I\ndidn't want it to do that, but.\n\n259\n00:12:40.242 --> 00:12:44.921\n[LAUGH] Another thing it will\ndo is it will automatically\n\n260\n00:12:44.921 --> 00:12:47.760\ncorrect misspelled words.\n\n261\n00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.831\nSo my favorite one is H-T-E.\n\n262\n00:12:51.831 --> 00:12:56.439\nAll right, if I hit the space bar,\nthere's two things that happens there,\n\n263\n00:12:56.439 --> 00:13:00.768\nit automatically capitalized and\nit changed my misspelling of, the.\n\n264\n00:13:00.768 --> 00:13:04.550\nOkay, and\nit will do all sorts of different ones.\n\n265\n00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.990\nLike I think, what is it?\n\n266\n00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.990\nHow do I spell it?\n\n267\n00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:10.256\nIt's weird to try to\nmisspell a word on purpose.\n\n268\n00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:14.799\nProgram, see how it switches the r and\nthe o?\n\n269\n00:13:14.799 --> 00:13:19.405\nAnd does, well it didn't change that.\n\n270\n00:13:19.405 --> 00:13:20.688\nIt's cuz dose is a real word.\n\n271\n00:13:20.688 --> 00:13:27.606\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And there's another one of the change.\n\n272\n00:13:27.606 --> 00:13:29.268\nThere you go, it's switching that.\n\n273\n00:13:29.268 --> 00:13:30.420\nFor me.\n\n274\n00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:33.930\nFew demonstrations here, right?\n\n275\n00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.080\nIt changed a bunch of words for me.\n\n276\n00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.588\nIt didn't do dose or\nfur cuz those are legitimate words.\n\n277\n00:13:41.588 --> 00:13:45.625\nSo, key on this, always proof your slides.\n\n278\n00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:46.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Always,\n\n279\n00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:50.685\nit's like, okay, it's not giving me any\nerrors because it doesn't see anything.\n\n280\n00:13:50.685 --> 00:13:51.925\nAnd it's not switching it for me.\n\n281\n00:13:51.925 --> 00:13:54.535\nBut make sure you've proof your slides,\nokay?\n\n282\n00:13:54.535 --> 00:13:58.075\n&gt;&gt; It's not as embarrassing as the text\non auto correct on your phones though, so\n\n283\n00:13:58.075 --> 00:13:59.490\nthat's pretty cool.\n\n284\n00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.685\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, yes.\n\n285\n00:14:00.685 --> 00:14:02.825\nYeah, his whole website's about that.\n\n286\n00:14:02.825 --> 00:14:04.300\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n[LAUGH] Hilarious.\n\n287\n00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:08.967\nOkay, so but I'm sure you might get\na a chuckle in an office presentation if\n\n288\n00:14:08.967 --> 00:14:11.709\nyou're talking about change for me with a,\n\n289\n00:14:11.709 --> 00:14:14.911\nwere talking about well we\nare talking about cats.\n\n290\n00:14:14.911 --> 00:14:18.227\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So anyways.\n\n291\n00:14:18.227 --> 00:14:22.057\nAll right, so I didn't want it\nto do some of these things.\n\n292\n00:14:22.057 --> 00:14:24.580\nAll right, smart tags, here we come.\n\n293\n00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.650\nOkay, so, notice if I hover, and I'm\ngonna zoom in so maybe it will show up.\n\n294\n00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:31.150\nDo you see how I'm hovering,\nI'm not even clicking on anything.\n\n295\n00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:36.890\nWhen I hover my mouse over these words\nthat Powerpoint had auto-corrected for me,\n\n296\n00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:41.520\nit's going to give me the option of like,\nhey, well maybe you didn't wanna do that.\n\n297\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.330\nAnd so, it gives me that smart\ntag of that auto-correct option.\n\n298\n00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.620\nI am going to zoom back out so\nthat I can see this a little bit better.\n\n299\n00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.140\nSo it shows on the hello if\nI click on it it is saying\n\n300\n00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.050\ndo you want me to undo that\ncapitalization that I did for hello?\n\n301\n00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:58.580\nOr do you want me to stop\ndoing this like altogether?\n\n302\n00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:03.760\nLike stop the whole rule that I am,\nor the feature that I have.\n\n303\n00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.010\nWell that's your decision.\n\n304\n00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.880\nI'd probably like to keep it normally,\ncuz for this particular one,\n\n305\n00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.760\nI'd definitely want that to happen.\n\n306\n00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.490\nSo you have those options right there.\n\n307\n00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:21.240\nLet me show you the one over on\nthe third bullet point that we did.\n\n308\n00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.830\nThe, remember it did two things,\nit did the auto capitalizing and\n\n309\n00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.840\nit also corrected H-T-E.\n\n310\n00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:33.310\nWell, what if HTE was\nthe letters of your company.\n\n311\n00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:37.360\nLike that's where you work and you're\nlike please, please stop doing that.\n\n312\n00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.540\nThat's where you can go into,\ndon't automatically correct it.\n\n313\n00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.390\nAnd it will stop doing that for\nthis presentation and that's great but\n\n314\n00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.680\nwhat about overall and so on and so forth.\n\n315\n00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.309\nSo, you can get into more of\nyour auto-correct options.\n\n316\n00:15:51.309 --> 00:15:55.517\nSo, you can change it on the fly for the\nones that it's doing, but if you're like,\n\n317\n00:15:55.517 --> 00:15:58.668\nthere's something systematically\nthat I wanted to change.\n\n318\n00:15:58.668 --> 00:16:02.507\nYou can go into the control\nAutocorrect options and\n\n319\n00:16:02.507 --> 00:16:06.530\nthen it gets in all the things\nthat your program does.\n\n320\n00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.310\nJust a quick mention this is across\nall of your Office products, so\n\n321\n00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:15.955\nthis is the same in Word,\nin PowerPoint and in Excel as well.\n\n322\n00:16:15.955 --> 00:16:20.072\nAutocorrect you can see that it's doing\nthe things that I started demonstrating.\n\n323\n00:16:20.072 --> 00:16:26.540\nThe initial cast, I do that all the time,\nso I'm glad that it does that.\n\n324\n00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.370\nAnd, you can see that it has a whole,\nhuge list of the different\n\n325\n00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:35.920\nthings that it's going to autocorrect for\nyou.\n\n326\n00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.292\nSo, you could always go through and\nsay that you can.\n\n327\n00:16:40.292 --> 00:16:41.203\nWait, I just saw it.\n\n328\n00:16:41.203 --> 00:16:45.030\nOkay, that HD, we'll go up a little bit.\n\n329\n00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.251\nI think you just saw it.\n\n330\n00:16:47.251 --> 00:16:50.439\nWell now,\nI'm getting like through my lists.\n\n331\n00:16:50.439 --> 00:16:53.040\nThere we go, right there.\n\n332\n00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.730\nSee, I don't want that.\n\n333\n00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.280\nSo you could actually take that and\nyou can delete it out of its list.\n\n334\n00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.240\nSay don't ever do that again and\nthen it will stop doing that.\n\n335\n00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.445\nSo, that's pretty nice.\n\n336\n00:17:03.445 --> 00:17:07.618\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Vonne, I like this features well\nbecause there may be some things that\n\n337\n00:17:07.618 --> 00:17:12.047\nif I end up working for a company like you\nsaid where there is a certain abbreviation\n\n338\n00:17:12.047 --> 00:17:13.672\nthat always gets corrected.\n\n339\n00:17:13.672 --> 00:17:16.959\nBecause like around here we tend\nto use abbreviations like crazy or\n\n340\n00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:18.520\nacronyms like crazy.\n\n341\n00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.576\nThat we can go ahead and\nadd that in there and\n\n342\n00:17:20.576 --> 00:17:22.988\ntell it this is what we\nwanted to type out instead.\n\n343\n00:17:22.988 --> 00:17:27.649\nSo it really does help in at least helping\nyou make sure that your presentation\n\n344\n00:17:27.649 --> 00:17:30.180\ncan be autocorrected if we need to.\n\n345\n00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.510\nBut also be able to actually adjust it for\n\n346\n00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.542\nthe customization that we need if\nwe don't need it to autocorrect.\n\n347\n00:17:35.542 --> 00:17:39.410\nSo there's really quite a bit of features\nin here and the idea of actually\n\n348\n00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:43.810\nhaving those features that are contextual\nare really helpful as well.\n\n349\n00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.330\nBecause you can do them on the fly\ninstead of always having to go into these\n\n350\n00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:47.760\noptions to change them.\n\n351\n00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.508\nSo really great information that goes on,\nokay.\n\n352\n00:17:50.508 --> 00:17:51.971\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne, what's next,\n\n353\n00:17:51.971 --> 00:17:53.266\nwhat are we take a look at?\n\n354\n00:17:53.266 --> 00:17:57.754\n&gt;&gt; Great, so I would like to just show you\nwhere I got to those auto correct options,\n\n355\n00:17:57.754 --> 00:18:00.840\ncuz like you said,\nwe were doing it on the fly.\n\n356\n00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.940\nI clicked on the smart tag, for\nsomething it had already corrected for me.\n\n357\n00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.590\nAnd I got this autocorrect options.\n\n358\n00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:10.040\nBut I always like to know where did\nyou even find that to begin with?\n\n359\n00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.320\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead,\n\n360\n00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:15.890\nI'm gonna cancel this to\ntell you where to get to it.\n\n361\n00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.652\nYou gonna go to the backstage view,\nit's really your File menu.\n\n362\n00:18:19.652 --> 00:18:22.370\nAll right, so we're gonna go over\nhere to our File tab on our ribbon.\n\n363\n00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:23.940\nWe're gonna go over here.\n\n364\n00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:29.360\nAnd you can see that\nit is in your Options.\n\n365\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.650\nI feel like I went kind of fast on that so\nlet me go, File, down in the bottom.\n\n366\n00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:37.780\nSee it is on the bottom left and I click\non Options and it is going to bring\n\n367\n00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.180\nme into all the different options\nthat I can do in PowerPoint.\n\n368\n00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:47.720\nSince we're focusing right now on\nthe quick, autocorrect options, [LAUGH].\n\n369\n00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.414\nThat's when it's doing proofing.\n\n370\n00:18:49.414 --> 00:18:52.028\nSo if you go into the Proofing section,\nright there,\n\n371\n00:18:52.028 --> 00:18:55.880\nchange how PowerPoint corrects as you\nformat, you can go ahead and do that.\n\n372\n00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.850\nAnd also you can see it goes into\nsome other things that it is doing\n\n373\n00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.300\nwhile you're typing.\n\n374\n00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:05.950\nRemember it corrected, or\nit gave the right squigglies for my name.\n\n375\n00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:09.784\nThat's because it is checking\nspelling while you're typing,\n\n376\n00:19:09.784 --> 00:19:14.186\nwhich normally I would want it to do but\nmaybe you're always correcting,\n\n377\n00:19:14.186 --> 00:19:19.305\nyou're typing things that are always gonna\ncome up wrong if you always turned it off.\n\n378\n00:19:19.305 --> 00:19:20.381\nI probably wouldn't want to.\n\n379\n00:19:20.381 --> 00:19:24.061\nBut anyways I just wanted to show you\nthat's where you can go to the autocorrect\n\n380\n00:19:24.061 --> 00:19:25.580\nand autocorrect options.\n\n381\n00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.160\nAnd just really quickly that\nautoformat as you type with those\n\n382\n00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.410\nordinals that I was doing.\n\n383\n00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:30.710\nIt's actually doing right there.\n\n384\n00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.899\nSo, there's different tabs for\n\n385\n00:19:32.899 --> 00:19:37.989\nthis Autocorrect Options dialog box that\nyou can get to if you ever wanted to.\n\n386\n00:19:37.989 --> 00:19:45.030\nSo that was completing the thought\nof the autocorrect and the spelling.\n\n387\n00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:50.540\nSo what if I am spelling words wrong or\nif I'm, like my name, right?\n\n388\n00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.350\nWe were talking about here\nI typed in my name, Vaughn,\n\n389\n00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:55.850\nand it's gonna keep on\ntelling me that it's wrong\n\n390\n00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.770\neven though of course now that I've\ndone it, it's not demonstrating it.\n\n391\n00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:01.000\nBut usually back on that title slide or\n\n392\n00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.550\nif I'm, there it goes, sorry,\njust had to give it a little time.\n\n393\n00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:07.864\nIf it's going to,\n\n394\n00:20:07.864 --> 00:20:12.722\nI don't even know, I'm trying to\nthink of a word that I can misspell.\n\n395\n00:20:16.666 --> 00:20:17.440\nAnything, Ronnie?\n\n396\n00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.790\n&gt;&gt; That was going to autocorrect.\n\n397\n00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:23.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's hard to\nthink of words to misspell.\n\n398\n00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.980\nHow about we do, computer?\n\n399\n00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:27.715\nWow there we go.\n\n400\n00:20:27.715 --> 00:20:28.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n401\n00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.588\n&gt;&gt; I misspelled computer, and.\n\n402\n00:20:35.226 --> 00:20:36.379\n&gt;&gt; Misspelled a word correct.\n\n403\n00:20:36.379 --> 00:20:37.249\n[CROSSTALK] But ran it.\n\n404\n00:20:37.249 --> 00:20:37.880\nYep.\n&gt;&gt; I don't.\n\n405\n00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.340\nI was thinking of font.\n\n406\n00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:39.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n407\n00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.990\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n\n408\n00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.900\nOkay, anyways, I'm trying to get\nwords as its misspelling, so.\n\n409\n00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:49.245\nThe nice thing you could\ndo if it's a word,\n\n410\n00:20:49.245 --> 00:20:54.245\nI don't know why,\nI can never spell necessary.\n\n411\n00:20:54.245 --> 00:20:59.450\nSo, anyways if I wanted to show you how\nif you right-click on words that you\n\n412\n00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:03.570\nhave misspelled, you can get up options\n\n413\n00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:08.630\nthat it will give you things like,\ndid you mean computer?\n\n414\n00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:09.780\nYeah that's what I meant.\n\n415\n00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.908\nDid you mean commuters?\n\n416\n00:21:10.908 --> 00:21:16.380\n[LAUGH] Now the thing is, if you spell\na word so wrong it doesn't understand,\n\n417\n00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:21.510\nlike I've trained myself\nhow to type in necessary.\n\n418\n00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.280\nAnd now it's not even going to correct it.\n\n419\n00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.731\nBut do you see.\n\n420\n00:21:25.731 --> 00:21:26.843\nI would spell it so\n\n421\n00:21:26.843 --> 00:21:31.670\nwrong that it wouldn't even give me\nthe options of how to spell it correctly.\n\n422\n00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:35.860\nSo right-clicking on misspelled\nwords can really help.\n\n423\n00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:41.010\nAnd there is also something else I want to\npoint out like, okay Vaughn is my name.\n\n424\n00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.760\nAnd I'm going to be typing\nthis in all the time.\n\n425\n00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.590\nAll right.\n\n426\n00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.894\nWell I don't want it to keep\ntelling me that that word is wrong.\n\n427\n00:21:47.894 --> 00:21:50.184\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Or like the HTE that is the name of our\n\n428\n00:21:50.184 --> 00:21:50.868\ncompany.\n\n429\n00:21:50.868 --> 00:21:52.220\nWe did the AutoCorrect options,\n\n430\n00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.900\nbut it's gonna probably think\nthat it's spelled wrong as well.\n\n431\n00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:59.100\nSo you could always go into things\nlike Add to the dictionary, all right?\n\n432\n00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:04.320\nAlways recognize this word\nas not being misspelled.\n\n433\n00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.900\nSo if you click it to Add to Dictionary,\nall right, perfect.\n\n434\n00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:11.000\nIt added it into the overall\nOffice Dictionary to where\n\n435\n00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.600\nit's going to remember that for you.\n\n436\n00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.580\nAnd that's always a really\nhandy little thing.\n\n437\n00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.900\nSo, I always like to do that.\n\n438\n00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.760\nNow, the one thing that PowerPoint\ndoesn't do that Word does,\n\n439\n00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:27.830\nis it does not give you grammar\nmistakes as you type, okay.\n\n440\n00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:33.450\nIn Word, if you're doing a subject-verb\nagreement that is incorrect,\n\n441\n00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:36.900\nit will give you the, I think it's blue,\nright, blue squigglies.\n\n442\n00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.370\nSo if you're coming from\nWord into PowerPoint,\n\n443\n00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.650\nit doesn't give you that as you type.\n\n444\n00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:43.140\nNow it will go ahead and\n\n445\n00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:48.050\nyou can run a grammar check when you do\na spell check of your entire presentation.\n\n446\n00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:49.590\nBut it doesn't do it automatically.\n\n447\n00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:51.780\nAnd that's just something\nif you are a Word user,\n\n448\n00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.740\nI wanted to point that out to you.\n\n449\n00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:59.965\nAnd that will cover adding\nsome text into our slides.\n\n450\n00:22:59.965 --> 00:23:01.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne,\n\n451\n00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.890\nwell that's a lot of great information for\nus in this episode,\n\n452\n00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:09.540\nas we took a look at some of the features\nof working with text inside of PowerPoint.\n\n453\n00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.760\nVonne did show us, of course, initially\nhow we can get text into our slides.\n\n454\n00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.220\nAnd by using those context related boxes,\n\n455\n00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.580\nit helps to put them in\nthe order that we wanted to.\n\n456\n00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:19.850\nUsing those bullet points, you and\n\n457\n00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:22.950\nI don't have to figure that out,\nit automatically sets that up.\n\n458\n00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:26.104\nOf course then, we also saw\nthose autocorrect features, and\n\n459\n00:23:26.104 --> 00:23:29.520\nVaughn even showed you how\ncan kind of add in more, and\n\n460\n00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:34.060\ncustomize that more to the liking, or\nto the suitability of what you want to do.\n\n461\n00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.877\nBut that's not the end, so what we're\ngonna do is we're gonna take a look at\n\n462\n00:23:37.877 --> 00:23:41.874\na part two and we're gonna see some more\ninformation but this is a great place for\n\n463\n00:23:41.874 --> 00:23:43.203\nus to go head and sign off.\n\n464\n00:23:43.203 --> 00:23:46.470\nFor ITPro.TV I've been\nyour host Ronnie Wong.\n\n465\n00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:47.430\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne

00:00:12.013\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.013 --> 00:00:15.008\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:16.715\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n6\n00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:19.999\ntoday we're taking a look at\nworking with text part two.\n\n7\n00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:22.512\nThere was so\nmuch jam packed inside of our part one,\n\n8\n00:00:22.512 --> 00:00:26.313\nwe needed a part two to help us make sure\nthat we actually get everything that we\n\n9\n00:00:26.313 --> 00:00:29.783\nneed to learn about working with\ntext inside of PowerPoint 2016.\n\n10\n00:00:29.783 --> 00:00:32.895\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be,\nwell, Vonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:36.336\nVonne, welcome back to studios and\nwhere are we gonna get started today?\n\n12\n00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:40.259\n&gt;&gt; Well we were working at our slide\nwe were talking about cats and\n\n13\n00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:42.603\npretty much about cats weren't we?\n\n14\n00:00:42.603 --> 00:00:44.355\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; A lot of cats.\n\n15\n00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:47.823\n&gt;&gt; We also went over our auto correct\noptions and all the different things\n\n16\n00:00:47.823 --> 00:00:51.015\nthat PowerPoint does when we start\ntyping text into our slides.\n\n17\n00:00:51.015 --> 00:00:55.189\nSo we're gonna continue on we're gonna do\na little bit more with adding text, but\n\n18\n00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:58.970\nwe're really going to focus on\ntaking it from other sources.\n\n19\n00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.260\nBecause a lot of times you might not\nbe coming up with the information all\n\n20\n00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.040\nfrom scratch and\n\n21\n00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.550\noriginally you might have some word\ndocuments that you're going to be copying\n\n22\n00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.060\nfrom and then maybe once you get it in\nthe slides you wanna move them around.\n\n23\n00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.349\nSo we're gonna cut copy and\npaste to start us off and\n\n24\n00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:15.435\nthen we're gonna keep\non rolling from there.\n\n25\n00:01:15.435 --> 00:01:18.970\nSo why don't we go ahead and\njumped in so what I had done for\n\n26\n00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.849\nour part one is I had actually save the\nfile at the point of where we were before.\n\n27\n00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:27.866\nSo you could see that I have my four\nslides that we started talking about\n\n28\n00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:30.330\nsprinkle cup cake and a tabby buttercup.\n\n29\n00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.830\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n30\n00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.537\n[LAUGH] And then we split went into our\n\n31\n00:01:33.537 --> 00:01:38.074\nauto correct option so, I just saved it as\nworking with text episode so I had a nice\n\n32\n00:01:38.074 --> 00:01:41.820\nstarting point to come back here.\nSo, I guess copy and\n\n33\n00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.119\npaste let's start there.\n\n34\n00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:47.970\nCuz maybe once we got to this point we\nrealize that when we're talking about\n\n35\n00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.910\nour cats and we had broken up this\nbulleted list across two slides,\n\n36\n00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.500\nmaybe we don't need to talk\nabout every body elses cats.\n\n37\n00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.550\nWe just wanna talk about yours and\nmy cats, right?\n\n38\n00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.660\nAnd maybe we want to put them in\na different layout, we wanna compare and\n\n39\n00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.520\ncontrast and things like that.\n\n40\n00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.290\nSo now I could go ahead and delete one\nslide, and then change the layout and\n\n41\n00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.840\ngo from there.\n\n42\n00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.770\nBut I'm really just kinda using this\ntechnique to demonstrate the concept of\n\n43\n00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.050\ncutting from something and\npasting it somewhere else.\n\n44\n00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.481\nSo there is multiple ways we\ncould have gone around this.\n\n45\n00:02:19.481 --> 00:02:22.930\nSo let's go ahead and after slide four.\n\n46\n00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.474\nI'm going to add in a new slide,\nof the two content lay out.\n\n47\n00:02:28.474 --> 00:02:31.010\nOkay, so I went ahead and\nadded my layout here.\n\n48\n00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.104\nSo I've got my stuff ready to go.\n\n49\n00:02:33.104 --> 00:02:38.032\nSo in Slide Two what I'd like to do is I'd\nlike to take out the parts that I have\n\n50\n00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:40.860\nwhere we're talking about my cats.\n\n51\n00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.510\nAnd then paste it into the other slide.\n\n52\n00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.840\nSo what we're going to do,\nwe're gonna take this and\n\n53\n00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.002\nwe're going to select our text.\n\n54\n00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:51.042\nNow we're going to be covering\nsome different techniques and\n\n55\n00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:53.503\nmake some shortcuts too on\nhow to select our text.\n\n56\n00:02:53.503 --> 00:02:57.913\nBut the whole idea is like you gotta\nselect it before you can do anything with\n\n57\n00:02:57.913 --> 00:03:02.043\nit and the easiest way to do it is with\nour I beam cursor we're just gonna\n\n58\n00:03:02.043 --> 00:03:06.116\nclick hold and drag and get the area\nof the text that we want to come up.\n\n59\n00:03:06.116 --> 00:03:08.320\nThis is by the way the mini toolbar.\n\n60\n00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.940\nWe're just gonna ignore that for\nright now.\n\n61\n00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.210\nI'm going to go ahead and cut this.\n\n62\n00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.240\nNow you can right click if\nyou're a right clicker.\n\n63\n00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.720\nWe did go over this in like\nthe introduction lesson as well.\n\n64\n00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.821\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and cut this out.\n\n65\n00:03:20.821 --> 00:03:23.870\nAnd that means it's actually\ntaking it out of this location.\n\n66\n00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.382\nAnd now I need to find the location\nof where I want to put it.\n\n67\n00:03:26.382 --> 00:03:29.020\nSo I'm gonna come down here to slide five.\n\n68\n00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.160\nI'm going to get my I beam.\n\n69\n00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.305\nI'm going to click right there\ninto the left placeholder box, and\n\n70\n00:03:34.305 --> 00:03:36.978\nI'll right click and I'm going to paste.\n\n71\n00:03:36.978 --> 00:03:41.674\nNow when I right click I'm actually\njumping ahead of myself a little bit\n\n72\n00:03:41.674 --> 00:03:46.010\nbecause I have these different\noptions of pasting, okay?\n\n73\n00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.508\nSo, I'm just gonna use the first one,\nbecause we're going to use this with\n\n74\n00:03:49.508 --> 00:03:52.459\nanother, to where we're really\ngonna be able to demonstrate,\n\n75\n00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.283\nwhat this actually means, all right.\n\n76\n00:03:54.283 --> 00:03:57.197\nSo, I'm just gonna go ahead and\nclick the first little paste button, and\n\n77\n00:03:57.197 --> 00:03:58.080\nthere you go.\n\n78\n00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.380\nI have cut and I have pasted.\n\n79\n00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.230\nAnd just to finish that off let's\ngo back over to our slide two.\n\n80\n00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.140\nWe're going to click once to get\nour cursor into the content area.\n\n81\n00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.330\nWe're gonna select a text maybe we'll\ngo a little different way up here.\n\n82\n00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.573\nWe'll go to the ribbon and\nclick the Cut button.\n\n83\n00:04:14.573 --> 00:04:18.693\nAnd then we'll slide back\nover here to slide five.\n\n84\n00:04:18.693 --> 00:04:22.990\nAnd we'll click again, and then we'll\ngo ahead and click the Paste button.\n\n85\n00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.660\nNow notice that we have the top button,\nthat's just gonna paste normal, and\n\n86\n00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.110\nthen the Paste Options which I had kinda\nshowed you when we would right click.\n\n87\n00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.530\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nclick it, and there we go.\n\n88\n00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.128\nNow we have a slide that has the\ninformation that I took from one slide and\n\n89\n00:04:38.128 --> 00:04:39.631\nput into another.\n\n90\n00:04:39.631 --> 00:04:43.027\nSo that's where you can go back and\nforth of copying,\n\n91\n00:04:43.027 --> 00:04:45.720\nor in this case, we cut, didn't we?\n\n92\n00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.897\nYeah, we cut here, so\nyou can either cut or copy,\n\n93\n00:04:48.897 --> 00:04:52.615\nwhichever way you wanna go\nfrom the presentation itself.\n\n94\n00:04:52.615 --> 00:04:55.677\nBut again, you have test in\nother places that you might want\n\n95\n00:04:55.677 --> 00:04:57.464\nto use within this presentation.\n\n96\n00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:59.539\nSo maybe you have it in\na Word document and so\n\n97\n00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:01.462\nthat's where we're going to go next.\n\n98\n00:05:01.462 --> 00:05:05.324\nWe're gonna go outside of PowerPoint\nbring that text in and see what happens.\n\n99\n00:05:05.324 --> 00:05:08.270\nSo for now, I'm just gonna go ahead and\nminimize PowerPoint.\n\n100\n00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.090\nWe're just gonna click\nthe minimize button.\n\n101\n00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.070\nSo it's just gonna kinda suck on\ndown to that task bar down there\n\n102\n00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.820\nthat's what I always call it.\n\n103\n00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.039\nWe're gonna go ahead to use\nour PowerPoint folder, and\n\n104\n00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.018\nI have a file called Alicetext.docx.\n\n105\n00:05:23.018 --> 00:05:26.160\nSo I'm just gonna open that up,\nand it's gonna open up in Word.\n\n106\n00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.090\nAnd I have this I'm just using this as\na place to put some text that I can\n\n107\n00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.396\nuse in our different episodes.\n\n108\n00:05:33.396 --> 00:05:41.080\nAnd let's go down to here, I've got some\ntext that I would like to take from here.\n\n109\n00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.910\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nclick hold and drag,\n\n110\n00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.370\nand then I'm going to copy it all right.\n\n111\n00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.682\nAnd now that I got that,\nI am going to switch over to PowerPoint.\n\n112\n00:05:50.682 --> 00:05:55.003\nEasiest way to do it is to click down here\non the task bar and then go ahead and\n\n113\n00:05:55.003 --> 00:05:56.413\nactivate PowerPoint.\n\n114\n00:05:56.413 --> 00:05:57.760\nAnd actually, you know what?\n\n115\n00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.546\nI need another slide.\n\n116\n00:05:58.546 --> 00:06:01.805\nLet's go ahead and\ndo a title and content slide.\n\n117\n00:06:01.805 --> 00:06:05.492\nAnd then I will click and\nthen I will go ahead and paste.\n\n118\n00:06:05.492 --> 00:06:10.805\nNow notice, in this example it went ahead\nand took each paragraph that I made and\n\n119\n00:06:10.805 --> 00:06:16.457\nput them into a bulleted list, which would\nbe great if that's what I wanted it to do.\n\n120\n00:06:16.457 --> 00:06:20.360\nSo it was kinda like all right, perfect,\nit did exactly what I wanted it to do.\n\n121\n00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.620\nThat's not always gonna be the case.\n\n122\n00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.389\nCuz it all depends on what and\n\n123\n00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:29.183\nhow the things that you're copying\nare going to like what they look like, and\n\n124\n00:06:29.183 --> 00:06:33.195\nhow they're formatted, and\nhow they're gonna be brought in.\n\n125\n00:06:33.195 --> 00:06:37.760\nSo let's look at another\nexample over here back in Word.\n\n126\n00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.710\nSo I have some text that\nis got some formatting.\n\n127\n00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.730\nOkay, you can see it's got\nsome Font size and some color.\n\n128\n00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.439\nAnd maybe I wanna go ahead and\ngrab this whole thing.\n\n129\n00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:53.390\nAnd notice that it does, the text is in a,\nI think it's in a Times New Roman?\n\n130\n00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.608\nYes, Times New Roman font.\n\n131\n00:06:54.608 --> 00:06:58.074\nAnd then over here in our PowerPoint\nthe text doesn't look the same,\n\n132\n00:06:58.074 --> 00:07:00.166\nthis is the difference between a Serif and\n\n133\n00:07:00.166 --> 00:07:03.840\na Non-Serif font Talk a lot about that\nwhen we get into formatting text.\n\n134\n00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.763\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n[LAUGH]\n\n135\n00:07:04.763 --> 00:07:06.923\n&gt;&gt; Don't get me started on formatting text\n\n136\n00:07:06.923 --> 00:07:08.072\nI'll go right away.\n\n137\n00:07:08.072 --> 00:07:10.730\n[LAUGH] I love to talk about topography.\n\n138\n00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.862\nAll right, so\nlet's go back over here and select it.\n\n139\n00:07:13.862 --> 00:07:18.261\nWe will go ahead and copy it or\nwe could Ctrl + C for that.\n\n140\n00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:20.641\nWe will switch back over to PowerPoint.\n\n141\n00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:25.120\nLet's get a new slide so\nwe can throw some more text in there.\n\n142\n00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.900\nI'm going to click here,\nbut before I paste this in\n\n143\n00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.630\nI don't really want it coming in as\na bullet, like on a bulleted list.\n\n144\n00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.760\nI just want an actual paragraph.\n\n145\n00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.321\nSo the easy way to do that is\nonce you've had your IBeam here,\n\n146\n00:07:37.321 --> 00:07:38.386\njust hit the backspace.\n\n147\n00:07:38.386 --> 00:07:43.560\nAnd it's like Deleting\nthe formatting of making bullets.\n\n148\n00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.027\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and paste, and I'm\ngonna use a short cut even though you're\n\n149\n00:07:48.027 --> 00:07:52.105\nnot watching my keyboard, I'm gonna use\ncontrol + V and it brings it in and\n\n150\n00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:54.403\nit's like it's doing somethings here.\n\n151\n00:07:54.403 --> 00:07:58.593\nIt remember that the words down in that\nsentence in the middle is in bold, but\n\n152\n00:07:58.593 --> 00:08:01.867\nit didn't remember some of my\ncolorings and everything and\n\n153\n00:08:01.867 --> 00:08:05.090\nthat's what You get with your\npaste options, all right?\n\n154\n00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:09.530\nBecause when you’re bringing it over\nthe default paste options is to use\n\n155\n00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.140\nthe destination things.\n\n156\n00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.690\nThis is my final place that I\nwant my text to come into, so\n\n157\n00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:20.510\nthis is going to start remembering and\nformat the stuff that It's already in.\n\n158\n00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.856\nLike all right, I'm going to\nmatch where my destination is.\n\n159\n00:08:22.856 --> 00:08:26.336\nIf I hover okay because I\nam letting you see this.\n\n160\n00:08:26.336 --> 00:08:28.080\nThe source formatting,\nthat's where it's going to say well,\n\n161\n00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.670\nI am going to remember exactly\nhow it came from Word.\n\n162\n00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.500\nSo you can use your source\nformatting as your paste option.\n\n163\n00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.050\nIn this one you can paste it as an image.\n\n164\n00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.070\nI'm not really ready to paste this\nimage because I want it to be\n\n165\n00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.270\nactual text that I could use,\nso I don't wanna do that.\n\n166\n00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:48.180\nAnd this is the one that I actually\nuse a lot which is keep text only.\n\n167\n00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.340\nBecause a lot of times, it's like I\ndon't want you to remember anything.\n\n168\n00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.790\nI really just want the information.\n\n169\n00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.870\nBecause then I can take it and\ndo whatever I want with it.\n\n170\n00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.830\nAnd you can see that it's just, doesn't\nhave any bold, doesn't have any colors,\n\n171\n00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.980\ndoesn't have any fonts.\n\n172\n00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.820\nIt's just the text.\n\n173\n00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.250\nSo I tend to use that probably the most.\n\n174\n00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.200\nJust for me and\nmy purposes of how I use products.\n\n175\n00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.150\nBut I wanted to at least show you\nthat that's what the paste option is.\n\n176\n00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.700\nThey're really really handy and\nthey can really help you out.\n\n177\n00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.260\nSo, i'm just going to go ahead and\nuse that text.\n\n178\n00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.630\nSo, there's that auto-sizing happening.\n\n179\n00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:21.570\nAnd here's all my text.\n\n180\n00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.660\nSo, that's copying from words\ndemonstration and that paste option.\n\n181\n00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.670\nI want to do one more just to show you,\nbecause a lot of times,\n\n182\n00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.780\nyou're probably gonna be\ntaking things from a website.\n\n183\n00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.690\nMaybe you're demonstrating things\non your company website, and\n\n184\n00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.540\nyou want to, there's a lot of\ngood text information there.\n\n185\n00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.080\nThat's a source that you can go to.\n\n186\n00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.510\nSo I have our ITPRO.TV website.\n\n187\n00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.780\nLook there's Mike and Dan.\n\n188\n00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.030\nAnd then I'm gonna grab\nthis little guy right here.\n\n189\n00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.180\nThat is Build Your Career, cuz this is\nsomething that I want to put in a slide.\n\n190\n00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.465\nNow I'm just gonna go ahead and\nclick, hold, and drag.\n\n191\n00:09:52.465 --> 00:09:56.830\nSo I saw that I-beam, and\nI'm gonna grab this chunk of our website.\n\n192\n00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.145\nI'm gonna go ahead and,\n\n193\n00:09:58.145 --> 00:10:01.610\nwell, I'm not gonna right-click because it\ndoesn't give me the options that I want.\n\n194\n00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:02.710\nI'm just gonna use my shortcut, so\n\n195\n00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:07.520\nI'm gonna do a Ctrl+C,\ngonna come back over to PowerPoint.\n\n196\n00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.650\nLet's just add a new slide to\ngive us a little blank space.\n\n197\n00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.150\nAnd then I'm going to go ahead and\nclick here and paste.\n\n198\n00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.290\nAnd you are like whoa, what just happened?\n\n199\n00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:17.680\nOkay a few things happened.\n\n200\n00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.320\nDesign ideas popped up in the right.\n\n201\n00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.260\nPretend that didn't happen because we\nwill get to that in another episode.\n\n202\n00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.940\nBut it came in and that was not\nwhat I was expecting it to do.\n\n203\n00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.350\nBecause a lot of times when you are taking\nfrom the Internet you are going to\n\n204\n00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:34.186\nretaining the HTML, the hyper text markup\nlanguage formatting of where it came from.\n\n205\n00:10:34.186 --> 00:10:39.000\nBecause it can support that HTML, but\n\n206\n00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.070\na lot of times, like this is not\nwhat I wanted it to do, all right.\n\n207\n00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:46.490\nPaste options is where you've\ngot those really handy things.\n\n208\n00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.850\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and undo that, and\n\n209\n00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:54.420\nbefore I paste, I'm gonna go into\nthose options that we talked about.\n\n210\n00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.410\nAnd you can see that now it's like nope,\ndestination,\n\n211\n00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.140\nthis is where that keep as text is\ngoing to be really handy, all right?\n\n212\n00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.280\nCuz I really wanted the build your career,\nand the little paragraph that information.\n\n213\n00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.930\nNow, [LAUGH] little side note,\n\n214\n00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.800\nwhy does a multi-colored bricks conveying\nthe idea of building your career?\n\n215\n00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.160\nI didn't see that text.\n\n216\n00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:16.887\nThat's the actual what's known as\nalt text that you can apply or\n\n217\n00:11:16.887 --> 00:11:19.654\nattach to an image tag in HTML.\n\n218\n00:11:19.654 --> 00:11:22.340\nDon’t get me started on HTML because\nI could go into that too as well.\n\n219\n00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.950\nBut anyways, it’s just for alternate\ntext for text browsers and for SEO,\n\n220\n00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.330\nthere is a whole reason\nyou would want to do that.\n\n221\n00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.540\nAnyways, wrong tangent,\nlet's go ahead and keep on PowerPoint.\n\n222\n00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:36.180\nSo, that is copying and\npasting from multiple sources and\n\n223\n00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.100\nwhere you’re going to go.\n\n224\n00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.300\nSo, there you go.\n\n225\n00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.429\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Vonne,\nI've actually seen this very often,\n\n226\n00:11:41.429 --> 00:11:45.818\nin the fact that I might be asked to\ncreate a presentation for someone else.\n\n227\n00:11:45.818 --> 00:11:49.012\nAnd they go well, here, I need you to\ncreate a presentation, Ronnie, but\n\n228\n00:11:49.012 --> 00:11:51.890\nI don't know exactly what\nthe presentation's gonna be.\n\n229\n00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.460\nAnd normally what they do is they hand me,\nof course, either sites, or\n\n230\n00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.790\ndifferent electronic documents,\nlike what you did.\n\n231\n00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.440\nThey're saying all right,\nthis is what it needs to look like,\n\n232\n00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.830\nit needs to look consistent.\n\n233\n00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:05.520\nUsing these different cut copy and\npaste options, gives you that ability\n\n234\n00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.380\nto now bring in multiple different\nformats into your PowerPoint.\n\n235\n00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.710\nAnd whether you wanna keep\nthem exactly like that or\n\n236\n00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.560\nwhether you want them to\nactually have that same flow,\n\n237\n00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.300\nhere are some of the options\nthat actually available to you.\n\n238\n00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.590\nWithout you having to\nretype the whole thing.\n\n239\n00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.690\nI know kind of the first times that I did\nit, I started typing in the whole thing.\n\n240\n00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.790\nAnd then somebody said, why don't you\njust copy it from that document and\n\n241\n00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.065\npaste it in?\n\n242\n00:12:27.065 --> 00:12:31.100\nVonne, I didn't realize that you could\nactually copy from one Office product\n\n243\n00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.540\neven into another one.\n\n244\n00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.160\nCuz I always thought the clipboard was\nactually local only to PowerPoint.\n\n245\n00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.950\nAnd so all of a sudden,\nyou open up the world.\n\n246\n00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.540\nAnd now you're saying my gosh,\n\n247\n00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.290\nlook how fast I can do this instead of\nactually having to retype in anything.\n\n248\n00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.255\nAnd if you've actually ever seen me type,\nVonne.\n\n249\n00:12:46.255 --> 00:12:47.271\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is a mistake.\n\n250\n00:12:47.271 --> 00:12:49.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To actually allow me to type anything\n\n251\n00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.590\nof any length at all.\n\n252\n00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.061\nSo cut, copying, and\n\n253\n00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:57.338\npasting really does maybe also help to\nsave down on things like typos and errors.\n\n254\n00:12:57.338 --> 00:13:01.050\nWhere you can actually say, here's\nthe exact quote, exactly as it is, and\n\n255\n00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.770\nthat way you don't have to kind of go,\nwas that supposed to be here or not?\n\n256\n00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:07.930\nIt really can help speed up your\nprocess in terms of the way\n\n257\n00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.588\nPowerPoint can perform.\n\n258\n00:13:09.588 --> 00:13:12.540\nAll right Vonne,\nnow that we've seen that option,\n\n259\n00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:16.190\nwe do have another option that we wanna\ntake a look at which are of course\n\n260\n00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:18.810\nthe idea of working with the speaker\nnotes a little bit, right.\n\n261\n00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.500\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah because that might\nbe where you would want to paste in\n\n262\n00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.500\nwhole paragraphs of information.\n\n263\n00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.980\nBecause again, depending on your audience,\n\n264\n00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:31.770\nyou might not want a slide that looks like\nthis, the one that has a big part here.\n\n265\n00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:39.288\nBut maybe you're talking about cats and\nbats cuz this is and Alison.\n\n266\n00:13:39.288 --> 00:13:40.960\nBut you don't want all this information.\n\n267\n00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.840\nYou want to put it down\nin the speaker notes.\n\n268\n00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.870\nSo, that might be a good place for it.\n\n269\n00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.970\nSo, where are my speaker notes?\n\n270\n00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:50.150\nDown here, on the title,\nno this is the status bar?\n\n271\n00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.794\n&gt;&gt; Status bar.\n\n272\n00:13:50.794 --> 00:13:53.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The status bar this is\nwhere you can show your notes.\n\n273\n00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.330\n&gt;&gt; And then it brings it here, and\nit's like really, really small,\n\n274\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.460\nthat's just because my resolution\non this monitor is a little lower.\n\n275\n00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.759\nIf you get the two pointed arrows between\nthe sections where the slides are and\n\n276\n00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:07.682\nthe notes, you can take that two\npointed arrow, click hold and drag.\n\n277\n00:14:07.682 --> 00:14:13.123\nAnd actually extend the area for your\nspeaker notes for you to be able to paste,\n\n278\n00:14:13.123 --> 00:14:17.410\nor just type in there,\nbecause you could just click in here and\n\n279\n00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.550\nstart adding your notes and type away.\n\n280\n00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.400\nBut I want to go ahead and copy and paste.\n\n281\n00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.960\nSo I'm gonna go jump back\nover to that word document,\n\n282\n00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:31.020\nI'm gonna go ahead and copy this I'm\ngoing to jump back down into PowerPoint\n\n283\n00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.060\nbecause I got my flashing cursor.\n\n284\n00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.170\nI keep emphasizing I got my i-beam,\nI got my flashing cursor,\n\n285\n00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.010\nbecause that's a lot of\ntimes people start pasting,\n\n286\n00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.310\nwell it's not going in\nthe place that I want it to go.\n\n287\n00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:43.310\nYou gotta tell it,\nyou gotta make sure you put that cursor\n\n288\n00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.830\nwith that flashing i-beam\nof where you want it to go.\n\n289\n00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:49.570\nSo I'm gonna go in here and\nI'll go ahead and paste.\n\n290\n00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.103\nI'm using my shortcut.\n\n291\n00:14:51.103 --> 00:14:56.511\nAnd it brings it in here,\nit did retain some of that the bolding\n\n292\n00:14:56.511 --> 00:15:01.087\nthe formatting came from\nin Word which in this view,\n\n293\n00:15:01.087 --> 00:15:06.080\nspeaker notes will support bold italic,\nsome bullets.\n\n294\n00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.950\nAnd if you were staying in this view, you\nwould think it wouldn't do anything else.\n\n295\n00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.752\nSounds like a teaser for\nwhat's coming next, doesn't it Ronnie?\n\n296\n00:15:11.752 --> 00:15:12.523\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n297\n00:15:12.523 --> 00:15:14.049\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ngotta keep you on your toes again.\n\n298\n00:15:14.049 --> 00:15:16.597\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we'll just go ahead and\n\n299\n00:15:16.597 --> 00:15:21.769\nkeep it as it is because I now have it in\nmy speaker notes and everything is great.\n\n300\n00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:24.631\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, the idea on the use of\nthese speaker notes are really going\n\n301\n00:15:24.631 --> 00:15:28.120\nto be important later on,\nwhich we'll probably definitely get into.\n\n302\n00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:32.420\nThe very fact that by adding in\nadditional speaker notes at this point,\n\n303\n00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.646\nlater when we want to we can only\nprint those speaker notes out.\n\n304\n00:15:35.646 --> 00:15:39.110\nAnd we'll end up seeing, as we give\nthe presentation, we can either have\n\n305\n00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.350\nit printed out before us or we can\nactually be using this screen as well.\n\n306\n00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.080\nAnd that way we can see what we're\nactually seeing up on the screen\n\n307\n00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:45.920\nas well as our notes.\n\n308\n00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.142\nSo it's really helpful for\nus to be able to have those notes there.\n\n309\n00:15:49.142 --> 00:15:54.048\nAnd if we do have long paragraphs, copying\nand pasting is actually the way to go.\n\n310\n00:15:54.048 --> 00:15:56.218\nNow Vonne the other thing of course then,\n\n311\n00:15:56.218 --> 00:15:58.761\nis we wanna take a look at\ninserting in a textbox.\n\n312\n00:15:58.761 --> 00:16:00.612\nWhen and why would I choose to do this?\n\n313\n00:16:00.612 --> 00:16:03.256\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\ncuz everything that we've been doing so\n\n314\n00:16:03.256 --> 00:16:07.510\nfar of adding our text has been in these\npredetermined spaces within PowerPoint.\n\n315\n00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:12.280\nWe've been adding it into the title and\nto the content area, the placeholders\n\n316\n00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:17.132\nthat the slide layouts have kinda dictated\nto us where they're supposed to go.\n\n317\n00:16:17.132 --> 00:16:21.925\nSo what if I just wanna add some text,\njust randomly,\n\n318\n00:16:21.925 --> 00:16:26.517\nin a space and\nuse that as an object within my slide?\n\n319\n00:16:26.517 --> 00:16:29.511\nSo let's go ahead and add a new slide.\n\n320\n00:16:29.511 --> 00:16:32.310\nAnd I'm just kind of just\ngoing wherever I'm going.\n\n321\n00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:33.635\nI'm on slide six, okay, that sounds good.\n\n322\n00:16:33.635 --> 00:16:35.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll go with blank.\n\n323\n00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.880\nOkay, so we have a blank layout, I don't\nhave any predetermined placeholders.\n\n324\n00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.980\nI'm also going to hide the speaker\nnotes for now just to go ahead and\n\n325\n00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.680\nmake the slide a little bit bigger.\n\n326\n00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.190\nAll right, so\nwhere do I go to insert a text box?\n\n327\n00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.658\nProbably the Insert tab on the ribbon,\nexactly.\n\n328\n00:16:50.658 --> 00:16:53.729\nSo I have Insert, and\nthen over here I have Text Box.\n\n329\n00:16:53.729 --> 00:16:57.309\nAnd then it's kind of\nlike picking up a pencil,\n\n330\n00:16:57.309 --> 00:17:03.052\nlike I've got the pencil in my hand,\nand now I'm going to draw the text box.\n\n331\n00:17:03.052 --> 00:17:05.375\nCuz a lot of times people are like, well,\nI clicked the button, nothing happened.\n\n332\n00:17:05.375 --> 00:17:09.722\nIt's like, now you've just picked it up\nand now you gotta tell it where to go.\n\n333\n00:17:09.722 --> 00:17:15.266\nSo, I'm going to just click,\nhold and drag, make a box, let go.\n\n334\n00:17:15.266 --> 00:17:18.437\nDoesn't really matter how\nbig the box is to start,\n\n335\n00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:23.329\nbecause you can always change it and\nyou can resize it and change the dynamics.\n\n336\n00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:24.031\nThe dynamics?\n\n337\n00:17:24.031 --> 00:17:26.037\nThe dimensions of the text box.\n\n338\n00:17:26.037 --> 00:17:29.677\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Vonne, what's that little\nsquiggly thing at the top of that box?\n\n339\n00:17:29.677 --> 00:17:30.482\n&gt;&gt; The little arrow-y thing?\n\n340\n00:17:30.482 --> 00:17:31.365\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Arrow-y thing?\n\n341\n00:17:31.365 --> 00:17:32.137\n&gt;&gt; Arrow-y thing.\n\n342\n00:17:32.137 --> 00:17:33.322\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] See, I've already started.\n\n343\n00:17:33.322 --> 00:17:34.495\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's the rotate.\n\n344\n00:17:34.495 --> 00:17:35.702\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; To where you can\n\n345\n00:17:35.702 --> 00:17:38.849\nactually change the orientation,\nwhether it's horizontal,\n\n346\n00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:42.066\nvertical, or to whatever angle\nof rotation that you wanna have.\n\n347\n00:17:42.066 --> 00:17:48.782\nSo I'm just going to say this\nis a text box, just to show you.\n\n348\n00:17:48.782 --> 00:17:51.395\nNow see, as soon as I started dragging,\nI made the box kinda big and\n\n349\n00:17:51.395 --> 00:17:52.152\nI started typing.\n\n350\n00:17:52.152 --> 00:17:55.565\nIt just was like, wait, I'm just gonna go\nahead and see that you're typing one line.\n\n351\n00:17:55.565 --> 00:17:58.884\nIf I hit Enter, then the box is gonna\ngo ahead and start getting bigger.\n\n352\n00:17:58.884 --> 00:18:01.321\nI'm just going to go ahead and\ndo the [SOUND].\n\n353\n00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:06.165\nAnd so, you can see that it's doing\nthe word wrap based on where I\n\n354\n00:18:06.165 --> 00:18:09.314\nhad told it to be\nthe width of the text box.\n\n355\n00:18:09.314 --> 00:18:12.971\nAnd then that's where you could\ngo back and change the width and\n\n356\n00:18:12.971 --> 00:18:14.558\nthe height of the text box,\n\n357\n00:18:14.558 --> 00:18:19.250\njust like we're going to be doing with\nour drawing objects in a few episodes.\n\n358\n00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:22.449\nBut you can go ahead and\nstart doing all of those different things.\n\n359\n00:18:22.449 --> 00:18:24.439\nI'm just gonna quickly\ndo it just to show you.\n\n360\n00:18:24.439 --> 00:18:29.668\nSo it's gonna change that text\nwrap of how it finds that edge and\n\n361\n00:18:29.668 --> 00:18:33.428\nwhere it's going to do\nthe soft line breaks.\n\n362\n00:18:33.428 --> 00:18:37.042\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne, how many text boxes\ncan I put on a single slide?\n\n363\n00:18:37.042 --> 00:18:39.324\nOr do I only have to have one,\nand that's it?\n\n364\n00:18:39.324 --> 00:18:40.860\n&gt;&gt; You can add them to\nyour heart's content.\n\n365\n00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.750\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So there's no limit, because here,\n\n366\n00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.840\nwe're designing free-form.\n\n367\n00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.070\nWe don't have any\npre-determined placeholders, so\n\n368\n00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:53.200\nyou can make your own title box,\nyour content box,\n\n369\n00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.410\nwhatever you wanna,\na little call-out, or what have you.\n\n370\n00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:59.200\nSo you can add as many as you want.\n\n371\n00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.630\n&gt;&gt; So the great thing is we're not\nlimited to just one text box and\n\n372\n00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.010\nwe gotta jam everything in per slide,\nso that's a good thing.\n\n373\n00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.910\nNow, Yvonne, the other thing that\nwe also want to consider, then,\n\n374\n00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:11.140\nis something that we\nalso call Outline View.\n\n375\n00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.070\nWhat is Outline View about, and why\nwould we choose to use it in PowerPoint?\n\n376\n00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.282\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\njust like we had the Slide Sorter view,\n\n377\n00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:21.653\nthis is just another view of your slides.\n\n378\n00:19:21.653 --> 00:19:23.584\nSo let's go ahead and look and\nsee what it looks like.\n\n379\n00:19:23.584 --> 00:19:29.050\nI'm gonna go over to the View tab on our\nribbon, and I'm gonna chose Outline View.\n\n380\n00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:34.345\nAnd so, what it does is it's just\ngiving you that Slides tab over here,\n\n381\n00:19:34.345 --> 00:19:36.302\nis now on the Outline tab.\n\n382\n00:19:36.302 --> 00:19:38.215\nAnd actually,\nin older versions of PowerPoint, remember,\n\n383\n00:19:38.215 --> 00:19:40.622\nthere was two little tabs at the top that\nyou could switch back and forth from.\n\n384\n00:19:40.622 --> 00:19:45.791\nAnd it's just going to give, instead\nof a graphical preview of your slides,\n\n385\n00:19:45.791 --> 00:19:48.505\nit's going to show over there the text.\n\n386\n00:19:48.505 --> 00:19:52.760\nAnd this is good for\nif you're using text-heavy slides.\n\n387\n00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.250\nYou can even edit the text or\n\n388\n00:19:55.250 --> 00:20:00.280\nadd text to your slides in\nthe Outline View, if you ever wanted to.\n\n389\n00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:05.159\nSo if I was coming down here,\nlet's talk about our cats, you see,\n\n390\n00:20:05.159 --> 00:20:07.686\nif I enter and I type in some words,\n\n391\n00:20:07.686 --> 00:20:13.289\nyou can see that it's actually adding\nin the content of my list in that view.\n\n392\n00:20:13.289 --> 00:20:17.511\nSo it's just another way of working,\nit's really up to you.\n\n393\n00:20:17.511 --> 00:20:19.704\nAnd every view has its reasons.\n\n394\n00:20:19.704 --> 00:20:22.384\nI tend to be a more graphical person, so\n\n395\n00:20:22.384 --> 00:20:27.870\nI don't normally use the Outline View,\nbut I know a lot people that do.\n\n396\n00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.110\nSo I wanted to at least show youm\nsince we're talking about text and\n\n397\n00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.530\nhow we can look at it.\n\n398\n00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:32.692\n&gt;&gt; All right, Yvonne, so\n\n399\n00:20:32.692 --> 00:20:36.415\nwith all of those different ways that we\ncan work with text a little bit more,\n\n400\n00:20:36.415 --> 00:20:40.210\nwe wanna take a look, also,\nabout selecting different text as well.\n\n401\n00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:41.714\nSo what are we gonna take a look at here?\n\n402\n00:20:41.714 --> 00:20:45.806\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and we've already started\ndoing that, the whole click, hold and\n\n403\n00:20:45.806 --> 00:20:47.922\ndrag to cut out sprinkles buttercup.\n\n404\n00:20:47.922 --> 00:20:50.515\nAnd, or is it sprinkles buttercup, yeah?\n\n405\n00:20:50.515 --> 00:20:51.841\nDid I get that?\n&gt;&gt; Sprinkle cupcake.\n\n406\n00:20:51.841 --> 00:20:53.719\n&gt;&gt; I was mixing those two together.\n\n407\n00:20:53.719 --> 00:20:55.787\n&gt;&gt; Tell me, buttercup,\n&gt;&gt; Tell me, buttercup, yes, exactly.\n\n408\n00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:58.304\nSo when we were taking out\nthat text from that one slide,\n\n409\n00:20:58.304 --> 00:21:00.940\nI had already showed you the click,\nhold and drag method.\n\n410\n00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.813\nSo I just wanna show you some shortcuts,\n\n411\n00:21:02.813 --> 00:21:05.635\nsome ways that can kind of make\nit a little bit easier for you.\n\n412\n00:21:05.635 --> 00:21:07.838\nSo this is as good a slide as any.\n\n413\n00:21:07.838 --> 00:21:14.266\nIf I wanted to select one word,\nI wanted to select the word cats.\n\n414\n00:21:14.266 --> 00:21:17.378\nInstead of, you can click, hold,\nand drag, nothing wrong with that.\n\n415\n00:21:17.378 --> 00:21:19.468\nOr you can double-click [SOUND].\n\n416\n00:21:19.468 --> 00:21:21.019\nIf you click, click, whoops.\n\n417\n00:21:21.019 --> 00:21:22.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Try that again.\n\n418\n00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.310\nIf you double-click,\ndouble-clicking will always select a word.\n\n419\n00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:29.467\nIf you triple-click, you gotta go 1, 2,\n\n420\n00:21:29.467 --> 00:21:34.790\n3, if you triple-click,\nthat will actually select a paragraph.\n\n421\n00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:37.850\nAnd since a bullet is technically\nconsidered a paragraph-level formatting,\n\n422\n00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.504\nit's going to select that entire bullet.\n\n423\n00:21:39.504 --> 00:21:41.547\nSo that might be two lines.\n\n424\n00:21:41.547 --> 00:21:45.163\nBut it's a nice handy way, I use these\nall the time, the double-click and\n\n425\n00:21:45.163 --> 00:21:47.817\nthe triple-click,\nto select words and paragraphs.\n\n426\n00:21:47.817 --> 00:21:49.510\nIt's a really cool little thing.\n\n427\n00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.934\nThis works in Word, too, so\n\n428\n00:21:51.934 --> 00:21:57.100\nthis is not just a PowerPoint-only\nshortcut, technique.\n\n429\n00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.830\nLet's go over to that slide that\nhad a lot of text, over here, so\n\n430\n00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:03.690\nI can kinda just show\nyou a little bit easier.\n\n431\n00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:07.030\nDouble-click, triple-click\nselects all of that.\n\n432\n00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:08.290\nThat's really nice.\n\n433\n00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.640\nThe other thing you can do,\nif you're a keyboard person,\n\n434\n00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.700\nis you can use your Shift key\nto select your text as well.\n\n435\n00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.120\nSo maybe I'll try to zoom in\na little bit so you can see this.\n\n436\n00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:24.400\nIf I click in front of but right there,\nif I hold the Shift key down,\n\n437\n00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.240\nthe Shift key will allow you\nto then use your arrow keys.\n\n438\n00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.630\nAnd if you click, click, click, with\nyour right arrow, you can see that I'm\n\n439\n00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:37.420\nselecting a letter at a time over here,\nbecause maybe I want just that one part.\n\n440\n00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.970\nThis is really a good where if you have,\n\n441\n00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:41.270\nit just gives you a little\nbit more control.\n\n442\n00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:44.070\nAnd if you're a keyboard person,\nit's kinda nice.\n\n443\n00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:46.200\nThe other thing is you can use your up and\n\n444\n00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.320\ndown arrows to start\nselecting lines of text.\n\n445\n00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.540\nSo I could use that and then use my\nright arrow a little bit to say,\n\n446\n00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:57.870\nthat's the specific area that I\nwant to select within that slide.\n\n447\n00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:01.300\nSo Shift and arrows are great.\n\n448\n00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:05.790\nIn Word and other ones, you can usually\nuse your Shift in conjunction with your\n\n449\n00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:09.240\nCtrl or Alt key to start\nselecting words and lines.\n\n450\n00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.350\nIt doesn't go that far in PowerPoint.\n\n451\n00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:16.850\nSo, but you do have the arrows and\nthe Shift, just not the other shortcuts,\n\n452\n00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:18.750\nif you're familiar with those in Word.\n\n453\n00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:28.080\nThe other one that I wanted to show\nyou was the Ctrl+A or the Select All.\n\n454\n00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.170\nA for all.\n\n455\n00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:32.680\nIf I have my cursor, remember,\nit's always about where is your cursor.\n\n456\n00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:37.060\nSo if I have my cursor selected in this\ntext, it's just flashing, and I do Ctrl+A,\n\n457\n00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:42.230\nyou can see that I'm selecting all\nof the text within that placeholder.\n\n458\n00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.301\nLet me go over to slide six so\nI can give another demonstration.\n\n459\n00:23:45.301 --> 00:23:48.676\nCursor and the word Pool, Ctrl+A, and\n\n460\n00:23:48.676 --> 00:23:53.648\nthen it selects all of the text\nthat's in that content box.\n\n461\n00:23:53.648 --> 00:23:57.752\nBut that's because I had a flashing\ncursor in that text to start with.\n\n462\n00:23:57.752 --> 00:24:02.144\nLet me show, if I click off this,\nremember, if we click off into a blank\n\n463\n00:24:02.144 --> 00:24:07.050\narea, if I do Ctrl+A now, do you see how\nit's selecting all of the objects, or\n\n464\n00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:09.630\nplaceholders within that slide?\n\n465\n00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:13.050\nSo where you're at when you click\nCtrl+A makes a big difference.\n\n466\n00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:18.020\nIf I wasn't selected on anything, and\nI'm over on my slides, and I do Ctrl + A,\n\n467\n00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.230\ndo you see how now it's\nselecting all the slides, right?\n\n468\n00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.770\nSo, Ctrl + A's great.\n\n469\n00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:23.740\nI use it a lot.\n\n470\n00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:30.816\nBut just watch where you are at to just\nmake sure that all is doing the all.\n\n471\n00:24:30.816 --> 00:24:35.670\nAnd then the last thing that I wanted\nto show you about working with\n\n472\n00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.974\nyour text is Find and replace.\n\n473\n00:24:37.974 --> 00:24:40.579\nFrom what it sounds like,\nyou're going to find something and\n\n474\n00:24:40.579 --> 00:24:41.842\nyou're going to replace it.\n\n475\n00:24:41.842 --> 00:24:43.006\nExactly [LAUGH] what it means.\n\n476\n00:24:43.006 --> 00:24:44.103\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n477\n00:24:44.103 --> 00:24:49.160\n[LAUGH] And\nI actually have another file that\n\n478\n00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:53.855\nhas I got some words that I already\nknow exist cuz we're going off the cuff.\n\n479\n00:24:53.855 --> 00:24:56.247\nWe're going off the deep end over here.\n\n480\n00:24:56.247 --> 00:24:59.588\nSo, [LAUGH] why don't we go ahead and\nclose this?\n\n481\n00:24:59.588 --> 00:25:02.945\nNow, it is prompting me to save\nthis file because it's like,\n\n482\n00:25:02.945 --> 00:25:05.347\nhey, do you wanna make your changes there?\n\n483\n00:25:05.347 --> 00:25:07.113\nYeah, I'm gonna go ahead and save that.\n\n484\n00:25:07.113 --> 00:25:11.466\nI'm also gonna go ahead and close down\nWord because we don't need that anymore.\n\n485\n00:25:11.466 --> 00:25:14.971\nMight as well just keep on closing\n[LAUGH] until I get back to\n\n486\n00:25:14.971 --> 00:25:19.220\nmy Windows Explorer to show that I\nhave a file called selectingtext.\n\n487\n00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:22.866\nI'm gonna go ahead and go over there.\n\n488\n00:25:22.866 --> 00:25:24.795\nAll right, so here we go.\n\n489\n00:25:24.795 --> 00:25:26.239\nI have some slides.\n\n490\n00:25:26.239 --> 00:25:30.820\nA lot of which we're kind of\nseeing from the other one with\n\n491\n00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:34.170\nthe Alice text in our paragraphs in here.\n\n492\n00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:36.640\nSo you could see that\nthere's the word rabbit.\n\n493\n00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.050\nThere's the word Alice.\n\n494\n00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:39.146\nAnd it's in a couple places.\n\n495\n00:25:39.146 --> 00:25:42.543\nI did wanna just point out\nto you that on slide five,\n\n496\n00:25:42.543 --> 00:25:45.312\nit is living in the speaker notes, okay?\n\n497\n00:25:45.312 --> 00:25:49.015\nCuz, maybe I want to find the word Alice.\n\n498\n00:25:49.015 --> 00:25:50.180\nI wanna see where it's at.\n\n499\n00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.283\nSee how many times we've got it.\n\n500\n00:25:52.283 --> 00:25:56.684\nTo go to find, it is Ctrl+F, okay?\n\n501\n00:25:56.684 --> 00:26:04.266\nOr on the editing group of the home\ntab of the ribbon, you can go there.\n\n502\n00:26:04.266 --> 00:26:07.047\nLet me go ahead and click Find, and\nit's like, what are you trying to find?\n\n503\n00:26:07.047 --> 00:26:10.134\nSo I'm gonna type in the word Alice.\n\n504\n00:26:10.134 --> 00:26:14.537\nOkay, now if I just type in Alice, there\nare some options here of match case and\n\n505\n00:26:14.537 --> 00:26:15.940\nfind word only.\n\n506\n00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.765\nFind whole words only.\n\n507\n00:26:18.765 --> 00:26:20.145\nThat'll make a difference\nin just a second.\n\n508\n00:26:20.145 --> 00:26:21.963\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nsay, Find next.\n\n509\n00:26:21.963 --> 00:26:28.084\nAnd you can see that it\nfound Alice's possession.\n\n510\n00:26:28.084 --> 00:26:30.496\nAnd then if I click Next, it's on a sofa.\n\n511\n00:26:30.496 --> 00:26:36.474\nAll it's doing is finding every\nnext instance of the word Alice.\n\n512\n00:26:36.474 --> 00:26:38.775\nAnd if you've been looking at that,\n\n513\n00:26:38.775 --> 00:26:42.626\nyou can see that I purposefully\ndid a lowercase alice.\n\n514\n00:26:42.626 --> 00:26:47.125\nAnd I also had on that first instance\nof where it found Alice that it did\n\n515\n00:26:47.125 --> 00:26:48.767\nhave that apostrophe s.\n\n516\n00:26:48.767 --> 00:26:52.757\nIf I had checked both of these options,\nand it's one or the other or all,\n\n517\n00:26:52.757 --> 00:26:53.815\ndoesn't matter.\n\n518\n00:26:53.815 --> 00:26:58.680\nAnd I go to Find Next, you can see it\nfound that one, that one, that one, and\n\n519\n00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.673\nthen it said there's no more.\n\n520\n00:27:00.673 --> 00:27:04.060\nBut we know that there are two\nother instances of Alice.\n\n521\n00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:08.875\nBut they just weren't matching our\ncredentials, if you wanna say,\n\n522\n00:27:08.875 --> 00:27:10.709\nof what we wanted to find.\n\n523\n00:27:10.709 --> 00:27:12.221\nSo those can be very nice.\n\n524\n00:27:12.221 --> 00:27:17.594\nNow if I find the word Alice, what if\nI wanted to replace it with Bob, okay?\n\n525\n00:27:17.594 --> 00:27:21.123\nSo I can say find what but then replace.\n\n526\n00:27:21.123 --> 00:27:22.900\nIf I got to this Replace,\n\n527\n00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:28.080\nit gives me another field of what I\nwant to take Alice and replace it with.\n\n528\n00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:33.050\nSo now in this one, I probably want\nto keep the Find whole words only,\n\n529\n00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:37.694\nbecause [COUGH] we have that Alices so\nwe probably want to do Bobs.\n\n530\n00:27:37.694 --> 00:27:38.774\nSo I'm gonna take that off.\n\n531\n00:27:38.774 --> 00:27:40.814\nAnd I know that there's a lowercase, and\n\n532\n00:27:40.814 --> 00:27:43.154\nI want to make sure that\nit changes everywhere.\n\n533\n00:27:43.154 --> 00:27:46.471\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nthen just type in replace Alice.\n\n534\n00:27:46.471 --> 00:27:48.830\nFind Alice, replace with Bob.\n\n535\n00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:51.620\nI could go ahead and\njust right away just do Replace All,\n\n536\n00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.940\ncuz I already found them and\nI know that they all live there.\n\n537\n00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:58.680\nBut you could systematically\ngo through and find each of,\n\n538\n00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.660\nlike there's one, yes, replace.\n\n539\n00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:02.920\nNext, replace.\n\n540\n00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.690\nAnd so on and so forth.\n\n541\n00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:05.498\nSo you wanna do one at a time?\n\n542\n00:28:05.498 --> 00:28:08.790\nOr you wanna just go ahead and\ndo the whole thing and just replace all?\n\n543\n00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:09.445\nSo that's great.\n\n544\n00:28:09.445 --> 00:28:11.290\nWhy would I use this?\n\n545\n00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:14.300\nMaybe we have a new supervisor.\n\n546\n00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:17.490\nMaybe we have a new co-worker,\nmaybe somebody's name has changed.\n\n547\n00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:21.930\nThere's a whole slew of reasons why you'd\nprobably wanna use Find and replace.\n\n548\n00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:24.940\nIf you have 60 slides,\nI don't wanna go through 60 slides.\n\n549\n00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.710\nSo why don't we let PowerPoint,\nor any Office product for\n\n550\n00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:31.550\nthat matter, do the work for\nus and help us out and replace?\n\n551\n00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:32.860\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that this Find and\n\n552\n00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:36.090\nreplace feature is very useful in\nthe context that Vonne has said.\n\n553\n00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:40.080\nBut I've also found out that Replace all\nto kind of be the double-edged sword too.\n\n554\n00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.180\nBecause it is matching a pattern.\n\n555\n00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.813\nSo, if for some reason it finds,\nlet's say Bob,\n\n556\n00:28:44.813 --> 00:28:48.158\nin the middle of a sentence somewhere,\nin the middle of a word.\n\n557\n00:28:48.158 --> 00:28:52.928\nB-O-B for some reason or another occurs,\nlet's say that the names actually\n\n558\n00:28:52.928 --> 00:28:54.017\nBobo instead of-\n\n559\n00:28:54.017 --> 00:28:54.639\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\nThat's a great point.\n\n560\n00:28:54.639 --> 00:28:59.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it will actually replace that, so\ninstead of Alice, you end up with Bobo and\n\n561\n00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.278\nit will change And\ndo some different things.\n\n562\n00:29:02.278 --> 00:29:04.865\nSo the way that Vonne showed\nyou's probably the safest way.\n\n563\n00:29:04.865 --> 00:29:07.696\nEven though it may take a little\nbit longer, it is safer to find and\n\n564\n00:29:07.696 --> 00:29:10.494\nmake sure that it's actually gonna\nreplace what you want it to.\n\n565\n00:29:10.494 --> 00:29:13.032\nAnd then you come across\nthat one where you go, yeah,\n\n566\n00:29:13.032 --> 00:29:14.780\nI didn't really wanna replace that.\n\n567\n00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.800\nAnd then you can skip over it and\nfind the next option as well.\n\n568\n00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.486\nAll right, Vonne, well, thank you again\nfor helping us to be able to see that\n\n569\n00:29:21.486 --> 00:29:25.003\nthere's a lot more to being able to\nwork with text than just going, okay,\n\n570\n00:29:25.003 --> 00:29:27.350\nI'm gonna type in stuff in PowerPoint.\n\n571\n00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.090\nAnd ta dah, that should be the end.\n\n572\n00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:32.019\nThere are, there's a lot of\ndifferent options available for\n\n573\n00:29:32.019 --> 00:29:33.831\nus to get our PowerPoints ready to go.\n\n574\n00:29:33.831 --> 00:29:38.740\nVonne showed us those options with cut,\ncopy and replace.\n\n575\n00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.154\nI tried to combine them together-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Thinking about tubby too.\n\n576\n00:29:41.154 --> 00:29:41.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and tubby.\n\n577\n00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:42.427\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n578\n00:29:42.427 --> 00:29:46.791\nremember than we can use these\ntechniques to be a bit more efficient.\n\n579\n00:29:46.791 --> 00:29:50.918\nTo really help us to get a tremendous\namount of text inside of PowerPoint when\n\n580\n00:29:50.918 --> 00:29:51.570\nwe need to.\n\n581\n00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:52.684\nSo we actually took a look at that.\n\n582\n00:29:52.684 --> 00:29:57.064\nAnd we also took look at the use of\nspeaker notes in this episode as well.\n\n583\n00:29:57.064 --> 00:30:00.735\nAnd then of course, using those\nSelect options and Find and replace.\n\n584\n00:30:00.735 --> 00:30:02.092\nThere is a lot of information here.\n\n585\n00:30:02.092 --> 00:30:05.535\nMake sure you also review this episode\nas you continue learning more about\n\n586\n00:30:05.535 --> 00:30:06.209\nPowerPoint.\n\n587\n00:30:06.209 --> 00:30:09.097\nBut for us, that's a great place for\nus to end this episode.\n\n588\n00:30:09.097 --> 00:30:13.255\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n589\n00:30:13.255 --> 00:30:14.209\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n590\n00:30:14.209 --> 00:30:18.352\n&gt;&gt; Stay

00:00:08.244\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.244 --> 00:00:12.183\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.183 --> 00:00:15.210\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.398\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today,\nyou're watching Microsoft Powerpoint 2016.\n\n7\n00:00:20.398 --> 00:00:23.400\nMore specifically we're going to\nbe diving into formatting text and\n\n8\n00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.600\nhere to help us understand that better\nis going to be Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.210\nVonne, welcome back and help us out\nwith formatting text in Powerpoint.\n\n10\n00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.910\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we're going to get all\nsorts of creative in here.\n\n11\n00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.750\nWe're going to be adding some color.\n\n12\n00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.430\nWe're gonna change some fonts.\n\n13\n00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.132\nAnd we're gonna change some bullet colors.\n\n14\n00:00:38.132 --> 00:00:41.740\nAnd we're just gonna just jump right\nin and talk all about formatting.\n\n15\n00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.110\nSo I have a file that I have started.\n\n16\n00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.710\nIt's where we have all the text already\nin there and that way we don't have to\n\n17\n00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.630\ntype anything in,\ncuz we're really focusing on formatting.\n\n18\n00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.930\nAll right, so it's formatting text\nI'll go ahead and open that up.\n\n19\n00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.610\nAnd here we go.\n\n20\n00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.880\nBefore we actually start applying\nthe different formats to our text,\n\n21\n00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.340\nI would like to go over this first slide.\n\n22\n00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.830\nOr I guess this is the second slide,\n\n23\n00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.013\nthis slide of character versus\nparagraph formatting, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:11.013 --> 00:01:15.920\nAnd, I forgot to save that,\nI forgot to, I changed this before and\n\n25\n00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.660\nI forgot to save the changes for\nthe formatting as I was reviewing this.\n\n26\n00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.050\nAll right, so\nwe have character level formatting and\n\n27\n00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.950\nwe have paragraph level formatting.\n\n28\n00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.180\nWhat that means is the, as I said,\n\n29\n00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.450\nlevels is whether you're at the word\nlevel or you're at the paragraph level.\n\n30\n00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.470\nA paragraph would mean that you\nhave actually hit the enter key\n\n31\n00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.680\non the keyboard.\n\n32\n00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.950\nAll right, but let's look over\nhere at the character formatting.\n\n33\n00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.270\nThese would be things like the font.\n\n34\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.560\nThat would be things like Arial,\nTimes New Roman,\n\n35\n00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.260\nI was going ahead of myself\nI was getting to curls.\n\n36\n00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.780\nI love that curls font,\nit's just so playful.\n\n37\n00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.180\nWe also have comic sans and\nall those wonderful fonts.\n\n38\n00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.450\nThere's seventy fonts you probably\ndon't even know what to do with\n\n39\n00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.240\nyourself with them.\n\n40\n00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.810\nI know I don't and I start to get a little\nlost in them, because what's the right\n\n41\n00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.330\nfont because fonts kind of say something\nto us like talking about that comic sans.\n\n42\n00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.590\nAnd it's going to be a little\nbit more playful rather than\n\n43\n00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.570\na nice hard font like a Times New Roman.\n\n44\n00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.520\nSo it kind of It gives a feeling\nas to what that is and\n\n45\n00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.020\nonce we actually start seeing some of it,\nI think you'll get the idea there.\n\n46\n00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.790\nWe also have the font size,\nhow big or small the letters are.\n\n47\n00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.230\nThe effects such as the bold,\nitalic, strike through, underline,\n\n48\n00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.610\nthings like that.\n\n49\n00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.510\nColor, I think that explains itself.\n\n50\n00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.940\nKerning and tracking.\n\n51\n00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.439\nNow, those are terms that maybe\nnot all of you are familiar with\n\n52\n00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.890\nAs a topography nerd like myself,\nI love kerning and tracking.\n\n53\n00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.470\nSo kerning is the space\nbetween individual characters.\n\n54\n00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.030\nLike the space between K and the E,\nthat would be considered kerning.\n\n55\n00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.390\nAnd kerning is measured in M's or 1,000 of\nan m's, and m's is an actual measurement.\n\n56\n00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.310\nIf you think about the letter m,\nwell the letter m is the widest letter\n\n57\n00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.660\nin the alphabet and so\nit bases that off of the m character.\n\n58\n00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.325\nTo whatever that font and\ngoes accordingly.\n\n59\n00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:16.190\nGoing a little bit in depth and\nit's just because it's a natural thing for\n\n60\n00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.420\nme to talk about.\n\n61\n00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.060\nBut once you get text that really\nreally big and you have like a w and\n\n62\n00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.540\nan a the way that your\nspacing of your fonts,\n\n63\n00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.730\nsometimes it's just too far a part or\nthey are too close together so\n\n64\n00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.992\nyou can use that kerning to go head and\ntake in between individual letters.\n\n65\n00:03:33.992 --> 00:03:38.340\nNow does PowerPoint actually have that\nlevel of character formatting to where\n\n66\n00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.450\nyou can actually do specific kerning\non those particular letters?\n\n67\n00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.220\nNo.\nBut it does, it does go ahead and\n\n68\n00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.000\ntalk about the character spacing.\n\n69\n00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.970\nThat's the actual,\nthe word that PowerPoint uses.\n\n70\n00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.540\nAnd it's going to kind\nof use these two things.\n\n71\n00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.370\nSo I'm just I'm going\na little bit further.\n\n72\n00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.480\nNow tracking, tracking is the space\noverall across multiple letters to where\n\n73\n00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.360\nyou're actually that taking the letter or\nthe spaces in between the letters and\n\n74\n00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.160\nmaking them uniform across all of\nthe letters within a word okay?\n\n75\n00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.820\nSo we will demonstrating some of that.\n\n76\n00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.050\nAnd then changing the case that would be,\n\n77\n00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.540\nwhether you have your sentence case or\nyour capitalize all words.\n\n78\n00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.160\nWhere I actually went up and\nchange that F, I capitalized that.\n\n79\n00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.210\nI could have actually just applied\nthe change case formatting on it and\n\n80\n00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.370\nhad it do it for itself.\n\n81\n00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.210\nWell maybe I wanted to go ahead and\nsay, characters versus paragraph.\n\n82\n00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.840\nI want that to be in all caps.\n\n83\n00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.470\nWell, before I knew that that was an\nactual format, I would actually delete it,\n\n84\n00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.520\nhit the Caps Lock on and\ntype it all over again.\n\n85\n00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.790\nYou don't have to do that.\n\n86\n00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.844\nYou can actually let PowerPoint do it for\nyou.\n\n87\n00:04:46.844 --> 00:04:49.312\nSo we're going to be going\nover things like that.\n\n88\n00:04:49.312 --> 00:04:51.450\nParagraph over formatting.\n\n89\n00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.130\nRight, centered, line justification, it's\nalso known in topography as justification.\n\n90\n00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.460\nIt's another word for\nalignment whether it's left justified,\n\n91\n00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.268\nright justified but here we'll just\ngo with left aligned right aligned.\n\n92\n00:05:03.268 --> 00:05:06.670\nBut bullets and numbering which\nwas almost all of the content\n\n93\n00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.190\nthat you put into your slide\nis going to be formatted in.\n\n94\n00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.310\nAnd we also have line spacing,\ntabs, and then it's a hyphenation.\n\n95\n00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.010\nI put hyphenation in there.\n\n96\n00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.330\nYou don't really control that in\nPowerPoint, but it is part of if\n\n97\n00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.380\nwe're talking about font formatting and\ntypography in general,\n\n98\n00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.850\nhyphenation is under that\nparticular level of formatting.\n\n99\n00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.560\nAll right, so all about character and\nparagraph level formatting,\n\n100\n00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.970\nlet's go ahead and\nstart actually applying that.\n\n101\n00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.960\nHow do we apply our fonts,\nand our size, and our colors?\n\n102\n00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.560\nYou gotta select to effect.\n\n103\n00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.800\nSo you gotta get that I beam and\n\n104\n00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.780\nthe letter selected as to\nwhat you want to format.\n\n105\n00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.860\nAll right, I'm going to demonstrate this\n\n106\n00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.010\nwithout selecting the word\njust to show you what I mean.\n\n107\n00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.010\nSo if I have cursor in a word and\nI come up here to\n\n108\n00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.540\nthe font drop down and\nI can choose a font.\n\n109\n00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.770\nAnd I'm just gonna choose\nArial Black just for like quickly.\n\n110\n00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.820\nYou see how it only applied\nthe font formatting to the one word\n\n111\n00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.710\nthat my flashing cursor was in because\nthat's a character level formatting.\n\n112\n00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.440\nIf I wanted it across the whole title, I\nwould have to make sure I click hold, and\n\n113\n00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.210\ndrag or we could do the triple click\nto select the whole paragraph, or\n\n114\n00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.590\nselect all whichever one you want to do.\n\n115\n00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.690\nGet it selected and\nthen you can go ahead an apply whatever\n\n116\n00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.570\nfont to those selected\ncharacters that you want.\n\n117\n00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.148\nMaybe we'll go with Berlin Sans.\n\n118\n00:06:41.148 --> 00:06:44.940\nI kind of like this font for\nsome reason when I'm teaching,\n\n119\n00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.400\nbecause it's very bold and\nthick text, right?\n\n120\n00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.014\nSo I went ahead and changed the font.\n\n121\n00:06:51.014 --> 00:06:54.752\nNow you do notice that in Word,\nthis is not Word, this is Powerpoint.\n\n122\n00:06:54.752 --> 00:07:01.750\n[LAUGH] But in all of the Office products,\nyou have the preview.\n\n123\n00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.160\nThe live preview of when I'm hovering.\n\n124\n00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.620\nI'm not even clicking on anything.\n\n125\n00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:11.690\nBut it's gonna let me see what this is\ngonna look like before I click on it.\n\n126\n00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.960\nSo maybe that Bradley Hand ITC.\n\n127\n00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.290\nThat's gonna be a little bit more playful.\n\n128\n00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.740\nIf we were doing things for\nchildren or whatever audience,\n\n129\n00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.260\nyou could see that text, this text versus,\nI'm just doing an undo versus this.\n\n130\n00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.350\nIt says something,\nit speaks to you in different ways.\n\n131\n00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.500\nSo picking what font you want,\nreally depends on what\n\n132\n00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.119\nyour audience is kind of geared towards,\nif you wanna say that.\n\n133\n00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.360\nSo we have our font itself,\nwe also can change the size.\n\n134\n00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.210\nRight next to it we have the numbers,\nyou can see that we have the live preview\n\n135\n00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:52.345\nhere, that's probably not a very\ngood size font for a title.\n\n136\n00:07:52.345 --> 00:07:56.905\nBut as you can see if I go bigger, it is\ngonna start doing that auto formatting.\n\n137\n00:07:56.905 --> 00:07:58.135\nAnd you can adjust accordingly.\n\n138\n00:07:58.135 --> 00:08:01.604\nIf you wanted to do like bump,\nI call them bumpies,\n\n139\n00:08:01.604 --> 00:08:04.279\nyou can do like the little bumps of the.\n\n140\n00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:06.261\nIncrease or decrease your font.\n\n141\n00:08:06.261 --> 00:08:09.845\nYou can kinda bump it down or\nbump it up with these two A's,\n\n142\n00:08:09.845 --> 00:08:12.051\nwith the little arrows on top of it.\n\n143\n00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:14.190\nAnd so you can go through there.\n\n144\n00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.740\nIf you wanted to apply bold,\n\n145\n00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.810\nitalics, underline,\nyou have the little buttons right here.\n\n146\n00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.410\nKeyboard shortcuts,\nCtrl+B, Ctrl+I, Ctrl+U.\n\n147\n00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.460\nIn PowerPoint, you do have\nsomething with the text shadow.\n\n148\n00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.630\nYou won't find this in your\nother Office products but\n\n149\n00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.460\nsince this is going to be\nsomething that's like an on screen\n\n150\n00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.210\npresentation that they went ahead and\nput that in as a command or\n\n151\n00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:43.130\na button in your font formatting, but\nyou won't see that in other products.\n\n152\n00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.894\nSo you can see that I can go ahead and\nitalicize it.\n\n153\n00:08:45.894 --> 00:08:51.060\nAnd I know this is italicized because\nI see a little box around the i.\n\n154\n00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.530\nI remember people will be like,\nI turn the italics on but\n\n155\n00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.400\nI don't know how to turn it off.\n\n156\n00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:00.080\nIt's just like an on and off switch, you\njust click it again ,so I click it off and\n\n157\n00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.350\nthen it stops being italicized.\n\n158\n00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.330\nSo let's keep on moving over.\n\n159\n00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.700\nThis AV with the line,\nthat's that character spacing.\n\n160\n00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.830\nThe kerning and\ntracking that we talked about.\n\n161\n00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.835\nThe technical words, character spacing.\n\n162\n00:09:14.835 --> 00:09:19.080\nBut there's where it lose, that's where\nyou're actually having more tracking and\n\n163\n00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.530\nif it was tight,\nthen that's less tracking.\n\n164\n00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.790\nSo that's the space overall\nbetween your characters.\n\n165\n00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:30.680\nSo maybe I wanted them, just kind\nof breathes a little bit more and\n\n166\n00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.990\nthere is our change case button,\n\n167\n00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:36.800\nit's where we're easily changing it\nto upper case, love that button.\n\n168\n00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.400\nI really love that button\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n169\n00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.470\n&gt;&gt; So we've got there.\n\n170\n00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.043\nAnd then we have the A with\nthe little line underneath it, and\n\n171\n00:09:44.043 --> 00:09:45.870\nthis is where we can\nchange our font color.\n\n172\n00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:51.190\nNow, the colors that are available to\nus right now are based on our themes.\n\n173\n00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:55.431\nSo when we get into applying themes for\nour presentation, those colors and\n\n174\n00:09:55.431 --> 00:09:59.606\noptions will change depending on what\ntheme we have applied to the overall\n\n175\n00:09:59.606 --> 00:10:00.971\npresentation slides.\n\n176\n00:10:00.971 --> 00:10:03.020\nBut for now we'll just go ahead and\nuse these ones.\n\n177\n00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.519\nWe still have that formatting and\n\n178\n00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:09.812\nthe different percentages of\nthose colors in the lines.\n\n179\n00:10:09.812 --> 00:10:12.000\nWe also have our standard\nrainbow down here.\n\n180\n00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.150\nBut what if I, I really want pink?\n\n181\n00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.665\nI like pink.\n\n182\n00:10:14.665 --> 00:10:16.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's where you could go to,\n\n183\n00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.860\nmore colors\n&gt;&gt; To go to more colors.\n\n184\n00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.740\nWe have our standard tab that gives you\nthe different colors that are in our nice,\n\n185\n00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.530\nlittle crayon box, as I call it.\n\n186\n00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:30.090\nIf you wanted a specific color,\nyou can go over here to custom.\n\n187\n00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:34.820\nNow this is where you just start clicking\nin this rainbow or this spectrum.\n\n188\n00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:39.820\nAnd then you can say, I like that green\nand then you can use this slider to go\n\n189\n00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:44.960\nahead and change it whether you want it\nlighter or darker and you can go this way.\n\n190\n00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.872\nIf you are design centered person and\nyou know about RGB values,\n\n191\n00:10:48.872 --> 00:10:52.639\nyou could go ahead and\ntype in your RGB color mode values here or\n\n192\n00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:57.076\nyou could change it to HSL which\nHue Saturating and Luminance I believe.\n\n193\n00:10:57.076 --> 00:10:58.231\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know.\n\n194\n00:10:58.231 --> 00:11:00.900\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm looking over at Ronnie's face, and\n\n195\n00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.480\nit's-\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] [LAUGH]\n\n196\n00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's okay.\n\n197\n00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.070\nWe don't have to go that far, but I just\nwanted to point that out for anybody that\n\n198\n00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.160\ndoesn't understand the different color\nvalues, and where you could type them in.\n\n199\n00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.751\nThey don't support CMYK,\nit would only be RGB.\n\n200\n00:11:12.751 --> 00:11:17.508\n&gt;&gt; Now Vaughn, I see that being a very\nuseful value, especially if your\n\n201\n00:11:17.508 --> 00:11:22.347\ncompany requires, let's say for\nexample, the name of the company,\n\n202\n00:11:22.347 --> 00:11:26.550\nit'll be in a certain font or\na certain font color to do that.\n\n203\n00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.084\nSo for example, you did work over\nat the University of Florida, and\n\n204\n00:11:30.084 --> 00:11:33.494\nI'm pretty sure that they only allow for\na certain like orange and\n\n205\n00:11:33.494 --> 00:11:35.852\nblues to be used with\ntheir particular logo.\n\n206\n00:11:35.852 --> 00:11:39.167\nBut even if you actually put their name\nup, I'm pretty sure that you can actually\n\n207\n00:11:39.167 --> 00:11:41.281\nadjust it to that particular\ncolor that they want.\n\n208\n00:11:41.281 --> 00:11:42.008\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes.\n\n209\n00:11:42.008 --> 00:11:44.022\nIt was 387 and 172.\n\n210\n00:11:44.022 --> 00:11:44.900\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n[LAUGH]\n\n211\n00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:45.870\n&gt;&gt; Those are pantone colors.\n\n212\n00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.130\nI'm sorry, I'm going way off on my\ntangent of like with designing.\n\n213\n00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:54.235\nBut yes, that is a very excellent point\nis, you do have companies that have\n\n214\n00:11:54.235 --> 00:11:59.764\nbranding and brand style guides, that you\nhave to adhere to a particular color.\n\n215\n00:11:59.764 --> 00:12:01.450\nIt's like our logos at ITPRO.TV.\n\n216\n00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.660\nWe have an ITPRO.TV orange,\nand we have an ITPRO.TV blue.\n\n217\n00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.260\nAnd then we have our light blue.\n\n218\n00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:11.170\nSo those are specific color values that\nif I were to be presenting to ITProTV or\n\n219\n00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:15.130\nthe University of Florida or any other\ncompany, you would want to match that.\n\n220\n00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:20.250\nSo you could go ahead and type in these\nspecific colors in their RGB values and\n\n221\n00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.510\nbe able to use them, that's a great point.\n\n222\n00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:27.560\nAnd later when we get into, I don't really\nhave anything, well I I do have an option.\n\n223\n00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.210\nIf I had an image of the logo,\nwhen we get into images,\n\n224\n00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.430\nwe went ahead and\nput in that ITProTV logo.\n\n225\n00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.680\nAnd I wanna match that ITProTV blue.\n\n226\n00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.910\nYou have this really cool thing\ncalled the eye dropper, okay,\n\n227\n00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:43.380\nwhere it will go out and actually select\nthe colors of where you're hovering over.\n\n228\n00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:48.578\nAnd I realize I don't have anything\nelse but black and white right now.\n\n229\n00:12:48.578 --> 00:12:54.540\nBut you could see that if I'm hovering\nover our different items on our slide,\n\n230\n00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:58.000\nit will go ahead and pick out,\nI didn't think it would go ahead and\n\n231\n00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.610\npick it out from the program itself,\nbut, yeah.\n\n232\n00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.820\nSo, you get the idea here,\nit's really fancy.\n\n233\n00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:10.271\nI remember when they added that because\nit, in some of your other products,\n\n234\n00:13:10.271 --> 00:13:12.860\nlike Adobe products, they have that in it.\n\n235\n00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:18.120\nSo once like Office brought it over,\nI was very happy.\n\n236\n00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.310\nSo the eye dropper is pretty fantastic and\nI just went ahead and picked that.\n\n237\n00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.010\nAnd there you go.\nThose are all the different character\n\n238\n00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.610\nlevel formatting that we went over.\n\n239\n00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.670\nThe one thing that I did not go over\nwas the highlighter that one little\n\n240\n00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.510\nbutton right there.\n\n241\n00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:37.081\nHighlight just means that you're actually\nchanging, just like a highlighter.\n\n242\n00:13:37.081 --> 00:13:39.730\nWe're taking it, we're selecting our font.\n\n243\n00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.080\nAnd then we'll do some, ooh,\n\n244\n00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.405\nthat's a little-\n&gt;&gt; Bright.\n\n245\n00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:45.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] A little scary,\nbut [LAUGH] at least you get\n\n246\n00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.260\nthe idea that you're actually formatting\nthe background color of the characters.\n\n247\n00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.680\nThis is not the same as doing\nthe fill of the object.\n\n248\n00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.250\nIt's just the background if you\nwanna say of the text itself because\n\n249\n00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.920\nthat's our character level formatting.\n\n250\n00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.590\nSo we go along with that.\n\n251\n00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.850\nWhy don't we move on to\na paragraph level for me.\n\n252\n00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:05.783\nDoes that sound good, Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n\n253\n00:14:05.783 --> 00:14:11.770\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's grab here, this\ncharacter, the word character within this.\n\n254\n00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.310\nI want that to not be to\nthe left of this text box.\n\n255\n00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:19.580\nI want it to be to the center or\nthe right.\n\n256\n00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.850\nI can select it,\njust like I had done before, and\n\n257\n00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:25.450\nI can go ahead and click the center\nbutton and the paragraph and\n\n258\n00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:30.690\nthen it centers it within that box\nthat it lives in, so that container.\n\n259\n00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:38.380\nAnd let's go over to another slide,\njust so I can get a clean slate.\n\n260\n00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.140\nRemember that whole, you gotta select.\n\n261\n00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.980\nWhen we were doing\ncharacter level formatting,\n\n262\n00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.830\nI told you you had to select all the words\nthat you wanted to have formatted.\n\n263\n00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.880\nIn paragraph level formatting, as long\nas your cursor is in the paragraph that\n\n264\n00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.530\nyou want to format,\nyou can just have that.\n\n265\n00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.210\nYou don't have to select the words,\n\n266\n00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:59.060\nbecause this is that whole level\nof formatting that we're applying.\n\n267\n00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.290\nIt's going to take and\ndo the entire paragraph that way.\n\n268\n00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:06.722\nFor example, if I clicked here in this\nparticular one, I hit the center or\n\n269\n00:15:06.722 --> 00:15:07.446\nthe right.\n\n270\n00:15:07.446 --> 00:15:11.920\nYou see, I didn't have to select that\nwhole Iine or paragraph of text,\n\n271\n00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.270\nit just did it for me.\n\n272\n00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.730\nSo, little kind of trick if you wanna say\n\n273\n00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:21.600\nof where is your mouse cursor have to\nbe and what you have to have selected.\n\n274\n00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.070\nAll right, so let's get back over\nhere to our paragraph slide.\n\n275\n00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:28.618\nSo I can just keep on going down\nthe line of the bullets and numbering.\n\n276\n00:15:28.618 --> 00:15:30.680\nThat where if I select.\n\n277\n00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.610\nNow, I am selecting.\n\n278\n00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:36.740\nBecause I am formatting multiple\nlevels of bullets, okay?\n\n279\n00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.000\nIf I go ahead and say.\n\n280\n00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.200\nI don't want to have, like,\na little circle for the bullet.\n\n281\n00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.040\nYou can see up here, in the bullets.\n\n282\n00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.160\nYou have different characters\nthat you can apply here.\n\n283\n00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.084\nSo maybe I want a little squares or\ncheck boxes.\n\n284\n00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:55.540\nMaybe I want something,\nI want smiley faces, right?\n\n285\n00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:56.240\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You can go\n\n286\n00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.500\ninto our Bullets and Numbering.\n\n287\n00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.264\nYou go into Bullets and\nNumbering and then it's like well,\n\n288\n00:16:00.264 --> 00:16:01.766\nI'm getting the same options.\n\n289\n00:16:01.766 --> 00:16:06.840\nDown here you have different options for\npicture Or customize.\n\n290\n00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.286\nWe gonna go with customize.\n\n291\n00:16:08.286 --> 00:16:12.550\nI think you might be able to get the idea\nof what it mean you're gonna do a picture,\n\n292\n00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.790\nbut I want those smiling faces.\n\n293\n00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:20.170\nSo if I go to customize I can\npick out any character within\n\n294\n00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:24.770\na font if I just know the right\nfont that I'm going to want to use.\n\n295\n00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:28.310\nRight now I'm just doing normal text,\nso I mean I could put dollar signs or\n\n296\n00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.140\nat signs and\nall of these different characters.\n\n297\n00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:36.450\nBut I know there is a particular font\nthat will give you all sorts of cute\n\n298\n00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:37.480\nlittle icons.\n\n299\n00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.630\nThat is our wingdings font.\n\n300\n00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.110\nI love me some wingdings.\n\n301\n00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:45.680\nAll right so I went ahead and\nscrolled down here to find wing dings.\n\n302\n00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.070\nI could just type it in.\n\n303\n00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:49.800\nNow you have wingdings,\none two and is there a three?\n\n304\n00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.430\nI can't remember.\n\n305\n00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:51.550\nThere is a three.\n\n306\n00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.060\nSo the wingdings one is the one\nthat I usually start with.\n\n307\n00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:57.680\nThere's also the webdings,\nthose can be kind of fun too.\n\n308\n00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.090\nBut I'm just gonna stick with wingdings.\n\n309\n00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:03.465\nSo, you can see that I have all of\nthese different little like pictures.\n\n310\n00:17:03.465 --> 00:17:07.225\nPer say of icons of what I want to do so\nup there is my smily face.\n\n311\n00:17:07.225 --> 00:17:09.755\nAll right, so maybe I wanna go ahead and\nclick this one.\n\n312\n00:17:09.755 --> 00:17:12.645\nBut you can see there's all sorts of\ndifferent ones that are kind of fun,\n\n313\n00:17:12.645 --> 00:17:14.355\nalmost like emojis or whatever.\n\n314\n00:17:14.355 --> 00:17:17.085\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick on that, click okay.\n\n315\n00:17:18.105 --> 00:17:20.025\nNow, it shows that I'm\napplying this smiley face,\n\n316\n00:17:20.025 --> 00:17:21.625\nI'm gonna click okay to show you.\n\n317\n00:17:21.625 --> 00:17:22.795\nThere is my smiley faces.\n\n318\n00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:29.000\nBut maybe I didn't like that the color of\nthe bullet is the same color as the text.\n\n319\n00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.680\nLet me just go ahead and change the font\ncolor to show you that if I change\n\n320\n00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.490\nthe color of the font,\nit changes the color of the bullet.\n\n321\n00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.890\nWhat if I wanted that bullet to\nbe blue and the text to be red?\n\n322\n00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:42.040\nWell, go back into that bullets and\nnumbering formatting.\n\n323\n00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.330\nAnd you can see that right down here,\n\n324\n00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:47.500\nyou're talking about the color\nof the bullet not the text.\n\n325\n00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:53.880\nSo I can change that to a blue color and\nthen I can click okay, shows you that.\n\n326\n00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.070\nThe size of the bullet in\n\n327\n00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:00.970\nrelation to the text that's also where you\ncould control if you provably saw that.\n\n328\n00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:05.630\nYou can see right there 100% of\nthe text versus lower or higher.\n\n329\n00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:11.100\nSome characters when we had our button or\nour little dot, it was kind of small so\n\n330\n00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:15.410\nyou could change that\nto 150% of the text and\n\n331\n00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.860\nyou can see that bullet will go ahead and\nmake it a little more pronounced.\n\n332\n00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.910\nSo lots of different things that you\ncan do with bullets and numbering.\n\n333\n00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:26.540\nAnd notice that because I have our\ndifferent levels, I did format all\n\n334\n00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.980\nof the bullets,\nno matter now many levels in or indented.\n\n335\n00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.440\nSo you could if you wanted,\n\n336\n00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:38.030\nyou could change the second level bullet\nby just selecting that second level.\n\n337\n00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.530\nAnd going here, but then you'd have\nto do it for every single one.\n\n338\n00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:44.520\nNow this kind of leads to the fact of,\nlike well I've changed all this bolts and\n\n339\n00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.340\nnumbering formatting.\n\n340\n00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:50.570\nBut if I went ahead and added a new slide\nthen everything is gonna go ahead and\n\n341\n00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:56.070\ngo right back to the default bullet\ncharacter and the formatting.\n\n342\n00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:00.240\nAnd that could start to not be fun\nif I have a lot of stuff to go with.\n\n343\n00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.270\nAnything that we're doing right now\nis going to be at the level from\n\n344\n00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:07.510\nthat slide and that slide only,\nand does not carry over.\n\n345\n00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.700\nWhich probably is making you\nlead to the fact that well,\n\n346\n00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.020\nI don't wanna have to format 60 slides.\n\n347\n00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.450\nThat's the slide master, another episode.\n\n348\n00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:15.100\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n349\n00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:15.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, but for now,\n\n350\n00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:21.220\nwe're just getting the idea of where the,\nhow the formatting goes along.\n\n351\n00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:25.030\nAll right, so we also have along with\nthe bullets, we'll stay with this one.\n\n352\n00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:29.310\nThe space between the bullet and the text.\n\n353\n00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:32.750\nYou see to me it,\nlooks a little crowded right now.\n\n354\n00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.720\nSo changing that spacing\nthat is a tab stops.\n\n355\n00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:42.430\nBut even though you don't even need to\nknow about tab stops all together, but\n\n356\n00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.840\nit does go along that in\nregular text formatting.\n\n357\n00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.490\nHere we are just going to call\nit bullet spacing, all right?\n\n358\n00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.800\nBut the easiest way to do this is\nif you go ahead and get the ruler.\n\n359\n00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.820\nNow, if I can't see something,\nI'm gonna go to the view menu.\n\n360\n00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.540\nIf you go over to the view menu and\n\n361\n00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.995\nyou go over to show in the ruler,\nit's already on there isn't it!\n\n362\n00:19:59.995 --> 00:20:03.240\n[LAUGH] Nevermind, well if you didn't\nsee the ruler, how about that.\n\n363\n00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.460\nIf it was like that,\nI forgot I'd already turned it on.\n\n364\n00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:07.960\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's fine.\n\n365\n00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.970\n&gt;&gt; So I have the ruler on and\nthis is where if you click,\n\n366\n00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:15.840\nI'm just gonna click on this one over here\nso you can see it a little bit better.\n\n367\n00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.050\nYou can see that my cursor\nis in this paragraph and\n\n368\n00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.980\nyou can see these two little guys up here,\nsee right there.\n\n369\n00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.420\nThat indicates where the bullet is\naligned and you can actually see\n\n370\n00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.360\nif I click on it and hold, you can see\nthat dotted line all the way down.\n\n371\n00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:35.350\nAnd then you have your arrow pointing\nupwards or in the rectangle underneath it.\n\n372\n00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.730\nYou click on that and\nyou see that's where the text lines up.\n\n373\n00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:42.650\nSo if you wanted to space the text further\nfrom the bullet or maybe you wanted\n\n374\n00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:47.960\nthe bullet to come all in, you can change\nthese two levels of triangles and it will\n\n375\n00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:52.985\nchange how the spacing of the texting and\nbullet close to each other, okay?\n\n376\n00:20:52.985 --> 00:20:56.867\nNow, I'm just demonstrating on this one\nbecause I'm only on this one paragraph,\n\n377\n00:20:56.867 --> 00:21:00.550\nyou can go ahead and select all of\nthe bullets to go ahead and change that.\n\n378\n00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:05.770\nSo if I come over here,\nnow again this is for multiple levels.\n\n379\n00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:10.330\nSo if I go ahead, and\nnotice right here it's kinda grayed out,\n\n380\n00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:15.160\nit's because it's seeing two\ndifferent level of the bullet or\n\n381\n00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.900\nthe text alignment versus the bullet,\nso that's why it's doing that.\n\n382\n00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.210\nAnd if I went ahead and moved this,\nyou see how it's going to go ahead and\n\n383\n00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:27.470\nchange in all of my levels,\nsecond level and first level.\n\n384\n00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:28.580\nSo you would have to go,\n\n385\n00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:33.600\njust like I changed this particular bullet\nindividually, you would have to go and\n\n386\n00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.050\nkeep your cursor in that second level and\nchange that.\n\n387\n00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:41.410\nSo I would click here and then say\nlet's move that whole bullet in, and\n\n388\n00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:46.630\nthen take that other triangle and move the\ntext and change the spacing from there.\n\n389\n00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:50.895\nSo a lot of having to get\ninto those specific levels,\n\n390\n00:21:50.895 --> 00:21:55.370\nagain slide master will make\nyour life a lot easier.\n\n391\n00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.670\n&gt;&gt; That slide master really helps us to\nchange the defaults on everything as we\n\n392\n00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:02.640\nstart, which can effect the way\nthat you want things to show up.\n\n393\n00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.998\nEven though Microsoft says here's the way\nwe do bullets, they give us these\n\n394\n00:22:05.998 --> 00:22:09.430\nsettings, but Vonne has just showed\nus how to change those as well.\n\n395\n00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.230\nWe're gonna also take a look\nat working with fonts, right?\n\n396\n00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.850\nPicking the right one is\nactually very important,\n\n397\n00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.870\ndepending on what you\nactually need to convey.\n\n398\n00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:18.980\nAnd Vonne also emphasizes that too.\n\n399\n00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.650\nSo Vonne, we also want to take\na look at the idea here of\n\n400\n00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:24.370\nsomething called format painter.\n\n401\n00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:26.280\nWhat is format painter about?\n\n402\n00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThat whole going and\n\n403\n00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:30.880\napplying that formatting to one thing and\nthen I need to do it for another.\n\n404\n00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.060\nThat's where the format\npainter can come in to play.\n\n405\n00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.590\nSo, I'm gonna go back over on my home tab.\n\n406\n00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:36.970\nThink of a format painter,\n\n407\n00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:41.570\nlike you have a,\nwe're gonna pretend this is a paint brush.\n\n408\n00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Take your paint brush and\n\n409\n00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.520\nyou're going to dip it into the paint.\n\n410\n00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.710\nThen you have the paint on the brush and\nthen you come over here and\n\n411\n00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:48.980\nyou paint it on the wall.\n\n412\n00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.380\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, the idea is\n\n413\n00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.080\nI wanna take the paint from here and\nput it on the wall.\n\n414\n00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:57.610\nSame idea of I wanna take the formatting\nfrom here in this text or\n\n415\n00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:01.740\nformatting, or paragraph or\nformatting, and apply it over there.\n\n416\n00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.850\nSo, I'm gonna here and\nclick on the, let's go here.\n\n417\n00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:09.110\nI'm gonna select\nthe alignment bullet level,\n\n418\n00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:11.010\nnotice that it's red text and everything.\n\n419\n00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:18.110\nI'm gonna dip my paint brush into this\npaint, so I've got where I want to copy.\n\n420\n00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:20.490\nI click the format painter, and\n\n421\n00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:24.875\nmy mouse cursor icon turns into\nan I beam with a paint brush on it.\n\n422\n00:23:24.875 --> 00:23:29.250\nThen I go ahead and\npaint over what I want to take,\n\n423\n00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:32.200\nand do you see how, or\nwant to copy to really.\n\n424\n00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:37.390\nAnd you see that it took\nthe formatting of where I had said,\n\n425\n00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.740\nnow make the painter, and\nit brings it over here.\n\n426\n00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.820\nIt's kind of like copy and\npaste formatting.\n\n427\n00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.060\nOkay?\n\n428\n00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:48.950\nSo that could be really helpful, but\nthe one thing is it's that one time only.\n\n429\n00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.530\nIt's like then okay I'm done.\n\n430\n00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:52.979\nRight?\n\n431\n00:23:52.979 --> 00:23:56.189\nMy analogy was instead of taking a paint\nbrush you would paint the wall you can\n\n432\n00:23:56.189 --> 00:23:59.517\ntake the spray gun, right, where you can\njust [SOUND], just spray like crazy.\n\n433\n00:23:59.517 --> 00:24:02.336\nThat's the kind of analogy\nthat I would always use.\n\n434\n00:24:02.336 --> 00:24:06.284\nWe can go back and get the formatting\nof where you want to originate and\n\n435\n00:24:06.284 --> 00:24:09.140\nyou can double click the format painter.\n\n436\n00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.910\nIf you double click the format painter\nit's like keeping the spray gun on.\n\n437\n00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:18.120\nSo if I quickly double click the format\npainter, you see I can go ahead and\n\n438\n00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.770\npaint over here.\n\n439\n00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:25.568\nPaint over here, paint over here, and\nI can keep on selecting and painting.\n\n440\n00:24:25.568 --> 00:24:29.530\nNow the thing is, it's kinda like if\nthe button's on, how do I turn it off?\n\n441\n00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:33.190\nCuz now you're like, no, stop, no,\nno, no, no wait I'm done right?\n\n442\n00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:37.270\nYou have to turn the gun off,\nor turn the spray thing off.\n\n443\n00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:40.456\nSo you come over here to the format\npainter you click it off.\n\n444\n00:24:40.456 --> 00:24:43.921\nAnd now you're back to the regular\nI Beam where you can go ahead and\n\n445\n00:24:43.921 --> 00:24:46.010\ncontrol how you want to do everything.\n\n446\n00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:49.287\nSo the format panel it's pretty handy,\nI do like it a lot.\n\n447\n00:24:49.287 --> 00:24:53.703\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, I've used the format painter\nover and over again, because what's end up\n\n448\n00:24:53.703 --> 00:24:57.288\nhappening sometimes is I inherited\nPowerPoint presentations and\n\n449\n00:24:57.288 --> 00:25:01.820\nI knew I needed to insert a new slide\nwith different things that were in it.\n\n450\n00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:05.560\nSo, the problem is I didn't know what\nthe user that previously created it,\n\n451\n00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.350\nI didn't know what font they chose,\nI didn't know the size,\n\n452\n00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:10.190\nI didn't know the specific color.\n\n453\n00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.705\nI didn't know any of that, so it was\nmultiple levels of formatting and then if\n\n454\n00:25:13.705 --> 00:25:17.329\nI we're to try manually create it then I\nhave not going search through the font,\n\n455\n00:25:17.329 --> 00:25:19.792\nfigure out the actual size,\nput in the actual color.\n\n456\n00:25:19.792 --> 00:25:23.470\nBut by using this format painter I\ncan put in there the default size and\n\n457\n00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:26.199\nthen just now copy that\nformatting paste it over and\n\n458\n00:25:26.199 --> 00:25:28.750\nthen I don't have to go\nthrough all that again.\n\n459\n00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:32.152\nSo it really can help save time, and\nit can help you in a mess when you're not\n\n460\n00:25:32.152 --> 00:25:35.508\nexactly sure and you have to produce\nas something like that very quickly.\n\n461\n00:25:35.508 --> 00:25:39.712\nSo I've seen it work very much so\nand it's really an incredible thing.\n\n462\n00:25:39.712 --> 00:25:42.193\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and along those same lines,\n\n463\n00:25:42.193 --> 00:25:47.530\nsometimes I always want to take everything\noff of what they did and just start over.\n\n464\n00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:51.820\nCan I just get back to the basics and\nthen, I'll apply the colors as I want?\n\n465\n00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:57.019\nThat's actually a good lead-in to what I\nwanted to show you is the reset button,\n\n466\n00:25:57.019 --> 00:25:59.243\nthe clear all formatting, okay?\n\n467\n00:25:59.243 --> 00:26:03.117\nSo I can take this text,\nI can select everything that I wanna say,\n\n468\n00:26:03.117 --> 00:26:05.940\ntake the font, the color, all of that.\n\n469\n00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.398\nI click on this little button right here,\nand you see I forgot.\n\n470\n00:26:08.398 --> 00:26:10.659\nI just realized it's not\ngonna take off the bullets,\n\n471\n00:26:10.659 --> 00:26:12.930\nbecause that's a paragraph\nlevel formatting.\n\n472\n00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:18.540\nBut it will at least remove the,\nall of the font yes,\n\n473\n00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.080\nthe character formatting, thank you.\n\n474\n00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.900\nAnd then I could go back and\nreset my bullets, I could go to none and\n\n475\n00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.810\nthen I could apply\neverything like that way.\n\n476\n00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:27.560\nBut you will have to reset some\nof the paragraph options, and\n\n477\n00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.910\nthat's kind of nice.\n\n478\n00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:31.230\nI do like that button as well.\n\n479\n00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.184\nOne last thing on the paragraph\nlevel formatting,\n\n480\n00:26:33.184 --> 00:26:35.737\ncuz you can see we talked about\na lot of these other things besides.\n\n481\n00:26:35.737 --> 00:26:39.261\nBut the only thing we didn't\ntalk about is line spacing, so\n\n482\n00:26:39.261 --> 00:26:41.948\nline spacing that's something right here.\n\n483\n00:26:41.948 --> 00:26:44.321\nThat's not it that's the column sorry.\n\n484\n00:26:44.321 --> 00:26:45.714\n[LAUGH] One more button up.\n\n485\n00:26:45.714 --> 00:26:48.170\nThere's our line spacing.\n\n486\n00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:52.826\nAnd you could see that with here if\nI wanted to add more space between\n\n487\n00:26:52.826 --> 00:26:57.661\nthe lines you can do the first one's\nwhich are just the line spacing.\n\n488\n00:26:57.661 --> 00:27:00.350\nAnd it looks like it's\nspacing everything out.\n\n489\n00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:05.230\nBut I did wanna point out on another\nslide some of the differences between\n\n490\n00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:09.397\nthe format, the space after paragraph and\nthe line spacing.\n\n491\n00:27:09.397 --> 00:27:11.920\nSo here we have two paragraphs.\n\n492\n00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.940\nThis is one paragraph,\nthis is another paragraph okay?\n\n493\n00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:18.700\nIf I selected all of this text and\n\n494\n00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.780\nI come over here to our line spacing and\nI start doing the line spacing.\n\n495\n00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:27.540\nYou see, it's adding the spaces between\nall of the lines of the paragraphs.\n\n496\n00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:31.770\nBut I really wanted a space\nbetween here and here, like after\n\n497\n00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:36.700\neach paragraph especially if you have\nbullets that span across two lines.\n\n498\n00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.320\nYou don't wanna add it between\nthe lines of the bullets,\n\n499\n00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:43.000\nyou wanna say after each bullet or\nafter each paragraph.\n\n500\n00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.940\nThat is space after paragraph.\n\n501\n00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.531\nSo if I selected this, I only have two so\n\n502\n00:27:47.531 --> 00:27:50.681\nif I had a couple more I think it would\nmake a little bit better demonstration.\n\n503\n00:27:50.681 --> 00:27:55.290\nIf I go into line spacing options,\nit's right here.\n\n504\n00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.490\nSpace, before and after.\n\n505\n00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:00.320\nI don't usually like to\nkeep the before space.\n\n506\n00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.265\nI always think of, like,\nwhen you're going down, it's always after.\n\n507\n00:28:03.265 --> 00:28:06.900\nCuz if you double up the before and after,\nyou're actually the doubling the space and\n\n508\n00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.050\nit can be a little confusing.\n\n509\n00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:09.590\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead,\nand put that to 0.\n\n510\n00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:14.390\nI'm gonna bump this up to 12,\nand I'm gonna click, okay.\n\n511\n00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:16.500\nThat was not enough to\nmake a big difference.\n\n512\n00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.436\nLet's go ahead and make that 24.\n\n513\n00:28:18.436 --> 00:28:22.465\nSo you can see that the space\nthat was added was between here,\n\n514\n00:28:22.465 --> 00:28:24.660\nnot between the lines.\n\n515\n00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:29.440\nSo that can be really handy if you're\nformatting bullets with multiple lines.\n\n516\n00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.038\nAnd I really like to point that out\nbecause I use a lot of space after\n\n517\n00:28:33.038 --> 00:28:33.835\nparagraphs.\n\n518\n00:28:33.835 --> 00:28:37.891\nAnd the one last thing I wanted\nto throw in there before we close\n\n519\n00:28:37.891 --> 00:28:42.416\nthis formatting section,\nis formatting within the speaker notes.\n\n520\n00:28:42.416 --> 00:28:47.324\nAnd I have, let's go ahead and open up\nthe speaker notes, and you can see if I\n\n521\n00:28:47.324 --> 00:28:51.564\npull this up, I have a decent amount\nof text in the speaker notes.\n\n522\n00:28:51.564 --> 00:28:56.684\nAnd if I take this in the normal view and\nstart using the bold, okay, that works.\n\n523\n00:28:56.684 --> 00:29:00.670\nAnd I apply it to be red,\nthat didn't work okay.\n\n524\n00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.400\nSo maybe I'll make it red and\nI'll make it 48 points.\n\n525\n00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:05.830\nI guess it just doesn't work, right?\n\n526\n00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:11.291\nKind of, you can do your basic\nformatting of the bullets and\n\n527\n00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:15.040\nbold and\nthings like that within the normal view.\n\n528\n00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:19.603\nBut that red and that font size,\nit's there you just don't see it.\n\n529\n00:29:19.603 --> 00:29:22.377\nWe're gonna go over to what's\nknown as the Notes view, okay?\n\n530\n00:29:22.377 --> 00:29:26.858\nIf I go to my View tab on the ribbon and\nI go to my Notes page, it did take.\n\n531\n00:29:26.858 --> 00:29:29.274\n[LAUGH] I have big red text there.\n\n532\n00:29:29.274 --> 00:29:32.665\nSo it's just really demonstrating\nto you that any formatting,\n\n533\n00:29:32.665 --> 00:29:35.150\nyou can format your speaker notes.\n\n534\n00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:38.100\nYou just don't see it unless\nyou're in the notes page view.\n\n535\n00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.100\nAnd this could be really good.\n\n536\n00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.820\nIf I was using this in a presentation,\n\n537\n00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:46.860\nI cannot forget to talk about\nformatting text and speaker notes.\n\n538\n00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.804\nYou can make it big and\nboulder or different font for\n\n539\n00:29:49.804 --> 00:29:52.352\nyou as a speaker to be able to look at and\nsee.\n\n540\n00:29:52.352 --> 00:29:54.884\nAnd you can do a lot more, oops sorry.\n\n541\n00:29:54.884 --> 00:29:57.760\n[LAUGH] I got the wrong mouse cursor icon.\n\n542\n00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.693\nI could come in here and start doing\ndifferent types of formating here.\n\n543\n00:30:02.693 --> 00:30:07.721\nSo I can use it for myself, but\nyou gotta go into the notes page view and\n\n544\n00:30:07.721 --> 00:30:11.300\nI just wanted to point that\nout that it does work.\n\n545\n00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.072\nYou can't format your\nslides in the notes view,\n\n546\n00:30:14.072 --> 00:30:16.313\nbut you can format your speaker notes.\n\n547\n00:30:16.313 --> 00:30:17.651\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne, well,\n\n548\n00:30:17.651 --> 00:30:21.932\nthat's a lot of information right there\nto think about in terms of formatting.\n\n549\n00:30:21.932 --> 00:30:26.370\nFormatting is a very important part of\ncreating a PowerPoint presentation.\n\n550\n00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:28.962\nBecause that's what really makes\nthe impact that you wanna make.\n\n551\n00:30:28.962 --> 00:30:32.150\nYou wanna be able to differentiate\nbetween let's say like a title, and\n\n552\n00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:34.610\nthen of course the text\nthat we have inside.\n\n553\n00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:38.020\nAnd so you may wanna make sure that you\ntake advantage of some of the different\n\n554\n00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:42.510\ntechniques, to be able to do the character\nspacing as well as the paragraph spacing,\n\n555\n00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:45.740\njust like Vonne showed us and\nalso some of those effency techniques.\n\n556\n00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:47.480\nLike using the format painter.\n\n557\n00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.930\nThese are all good techniques for\nus to think about.\n\n558\n00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:53.426\nAnd that you give presentations of course\ntake a look at all of your speaker notes\n\n559\n00:30:53.426 --> 00:30:55.787\nand see some of the other\nthings that you can do there.\n\n560\n00:30:55.787 --> 00:31:00.384\nBut this is also a great place for\nus to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n561\n00:31:00.384 --> 00:31:01.929\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n562\n00:31:01.929 --> 00:31:02.788\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n563\n00:31:02.788 --> 00:31:07.165\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Microsoft PowerPoint 2016 shows.\n\n564\n00:31:07.165 --> 00:31:13.376\n[MUSIC]\n\n565\n00:31:13.376 --> 00:31:16.231\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

They show how to insert an image and how to manipulate the image by using the sizing handles and different tools that can change the appearance of the image on a slide.   They discuss the importance of image size and cropping too.  Lastly, Vonne also demonstrates how to remove some background from some images.",

00:00:08.226\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.226 --> 00:00:12.101\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.101 --> 00:00:15.096\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:20.270\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today you're\nwatching Microsoft PowerPoint 2016.\n\n7\n00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.660\nWe're specifically gonna be diving into\nthe realm of images inside of PowerPoint\n\n8\n00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.330\n2016.\n\n9\n00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.610\nAnd here to help us is, of course,\n\n10\n00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.280\nour PowerPoint expert herself,\nMiss Vonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.860\nVonne, welcome back to the studios.\n\n12\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.818\nAnd let's talk about the idea\nof working with images today,\n\n13\n00:00:33.818 --> 00:00:35.217\nwhat are we taking a look at?\n\n14\n00:00:35.217 --> 00:00:36.905\n&gt;&gt; We are going to be\ntaking a look at the cats.\n\n15\n00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:37.883\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cats?\n\n16\n00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:39.163\n&gt;&gt; Cats, cats, cats, so\n\n17\n00:00:39.163 --> 00:00:42.955\nwe're gonna use the same thing we've\nbeen going along with our cats.\n\n18\n00:00:42.955 --> 00:00:46.161\nAnd we're going to be\ninserting pictures of my cats-\n\n19\n00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:46.850\n&gt;&gt; Cats.\n\n20\n00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.390\n&gt;&gt; Into our PowerPoint presentation as\nwell as going to find images online.\n\n21\n00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.040\nSo if we're gonna be working with images,\nyou're gonna have to have an image.\n\n22\n00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.555\nSo those are your different options.\n\n23\n00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:59.945\nIf you have a file or does the internet\nhave a file for you to get?\n\n24\n00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:04.658\nSo I have a PowerPoint presentation\ncreated to kind of help us along.\n\n25\n00:01:04.658 --> 00:01:11.650\nI have Images.pptx, and\nwe've got our images, okay?\n\n26\n00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.940\nI want to start with a blank side, so we\ncan just go ahead and insert the images.\n\n27\n00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.700\nAnd, well, I think that's the easiest\nway to start, is go to the Insert tab.\n\n28\n00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.990\nAnd you go to Pictures.\n\n29\n00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.180\nI've been saying Images,\nbut it does say Pictures.\n\n30\n00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.720\nAll right, now these are the ones\nthat I have on my computer, so\n\n31\n00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.320\nI'm going to go ahead and click on here.\n\n32\n00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.960\nNow I do have a whole\nfolder full of images.\n\n33\n00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.020\nThey are on my Desktop, so I'll just say,\ntherefore I know they're on the Desktop.\n\n34\n00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.985\nI know they're in the images.\n\n35\n00:01:38.985 --> 00:01:42.004\nAnd so\nyou can see all the different pictures.\n\n36\n00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:43.502\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; Of cats.\n\n37\n00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:44.830\n&gt;&gt; Lots of cats.\n\n38\n00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.184\nBut I have some scenery in there as well.\n\n39\n00:01:46.184 --> 00:01:46.983\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay.\n\n40\n00:01:46.983 --> 00:01:48.587\n&gt;&gt; Got some nice sunsets and everything.\n\n41\n00:01:48.587 --> 00:01:49.287\n&gt;&gt; With cats.\n\n42\n00:01:49.287 --> 00:01:54.775\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so\nwhy don't we pick that one?\n\n43\n00:01:54.775 --> 00:01:58.443\nWhy don't we go ahead pick this,\nFuego looking all regal.\n\n44\n00:01:58.443 --> 00:02:00.405\n&gt;&gt; With the sunset in the background,\nhow nice.\n\n45\n00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:03.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n46\n00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.430\nAll right, the design ideas keeps popping\nup cuz it really wants to help me.\n\n47\n00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.320\nI'm not ready to tell you exactly what\nthat is even though it's really cool.\n\n48\n00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.250\n&gt;&gt; So we're just gonna go ahead and\nget the image in.\n\n49\n00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.880\nAnd there is Fuego looking like\nthe lion that he thinks he is.\n\n50\n00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.340\nSo, and that's it really,\nI mean we could stop right there.\n\n51\n00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.470\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; But obviously there's a lot more to do.\n\n52\n00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.602\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; With working with our pictures.\n\n53\n00:02:26.602 --> 00:02:29.797\nFor example, well first thing\nis he's kind of big, right.\n\n54\n00:02:29.797 --> 00:02:32.595\nHe's taking up the whole slide and\nI don't want him to be that big.\n\n55\n00:02:32.595 --> 00:02:35.642\nSo you have how you can resize and\nrotate and\n\n56\n00:02:35.642 --> 00:02:40.136\nyour pictures if I click it once\ncuz I got that four point arrow.\n\n57\n00:02:40.136 --> 00:02:43.252\nBecause that means that I'm over\nan object that I can select.\n\n58\n00:02:43.252 --> 00:02:48.776\nI go ahead and get the resizing handles or\nthe little dots on the corners.\n\n59\n00:02:48.776 --> 00:02:52.398\nIf you hover those you get\na two pointed arrow now.\n\n60\n00:02:52.398 --> 00:02:55.950\nYou wanna go from a corner when\nyou're resizing a picture.\n\n61\n00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.530\nBecause if you go from a side.\n\n62\n00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.385\nYou see then it's like, I mean, Fuego\nthinks he's smaller than he really is.\n\n63\n00:03:03.385 --> 00:03:08.332\nBut now it distorts the image or\naspect ratio of the picture is off, so\n\n64\n00:03:08.332 --> 00:03:10.820\nI'm gonna go ahead and undo that.\n\n65\n00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.717\nBut, if you grab a corner,\nand you click hold and drag.\n\n66\n00:03:13.717 --> 00:03:16.229\nDo you see how,\nif you do the corner, it's.\n\n67\n00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:19.501\nI'm gonna keep the width and\nheight proportionate to itself.\n\n68\n00:03:19.501 --> 00:03:24.761\nAnd that's what you really would\nlike to do, at least, that I think,\n\n69\n00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:30.230\ncuz I've seen presentations, or\nanything with a skewed image.\n\n70\n00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.532\nI see it right away, but\nthat's because again I'm in design work.\n\n71\n00:03:33.532 --> 00:03:36.560\nAnd so I notice it right away, other\npeople are like, what's wrong with it?\n\n72\n00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.640\nI'm like, no.\n\n73\n00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.945\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So keep that corner and\n\n74\n00:03:39.945 --> 00:03:42.600\nyou can go ahead and resize that image.\n\n75\n00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.740\nMaybe you wanna tilt it a little bit.\n\n76\n00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.570\nYou do have a little rotate\nbutton on the top and\n\n77\n00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.070\nit makes your mouse cursor\nto turn a little rotator.\n\n78\n00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.993\nAnd you'd click, hold, and drag.\n\n79\n00:03:50.993 --> 00:03:54.538\nAnd then you can go ahead and\nrotate off, yay!\n\n80\n00:03:54.538 --> 00:03:55.099\nThere we go.\n\n81\n00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:56.283\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n82\n00:03:56.283 --> 00:03:58.752\n&gt;&gt; So you could do the resize, rotate, and\n\n83\n00:03:58.752 --> 00:04:01.011\nI am moving it, I've been doing it.\n\n84\n00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:03.066\nIt's just really getting\nthat four pointed arrow.\n\n85\n00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:06.483\nAnd just moving it to the position of,\nin the slide that you want,\n\n86\n00:04:06.483 --> 00:04:09.280\nmaybe I'll go ahead and\nrotate it over here.\n\n87\n00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.230\nAnd so on and so forth,\n\n88\n00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.875\nso, if I wanna make it bigger,\nnotice I can make it bigger.\n\n89\n00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:18.298\nIt still looks good,\nthe reason it still looks good is\n\n90\n00:04:18.298 --> 00:04:22.635\nbecause this was a really\nlarge image to start with.\n\n91\n00:04:22.635 --> 00:04:26.613\nSo, this is another area where\nI could get very long-winded,\n\n92\n00:04:26.613 --> 00:04:28.799\nresolution, image resolution.\n\n93\n00:04:28.799 --> 00:04:31.933\nImages and fonts are probably my\ntwo favorite things to talk about.\n\n94\n00:04:31.933 --> 00:04:36.476\nBut I will keep it brief and give you\nthe big overview, big pictures and\n\n95\n00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:38.660\nsmall pictures, really.\n\n96\n00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.470\nYou have, and I'm actually just gonna\ngo out to my desktop to show you,\n\n97\n00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.762\nin my images folder.\n\n98\n00:04:44.762 --> 00:04:49.436\nI have Bishop,\nwe call him Bish, little Bish.\n\n99\n00:04:49.436 --> 00:04:51.672\nWe have Bish and we have Bish small.\n\n100\n00:04:51.672 --> 00:04:55.577\nIn my file explorer, you would\nthink that these are the same size,\n\n101\n00:04:55.577 --> 00:04:58.391\nlike all of these pictures\nare of the same size.\n\n102\n00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:00.250\nBut they are not.\n\n103\n00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.660\nThe actual pixel information that\nis in your picture determines\n\n104\n00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.178\nthe size of the photograph and\nthe resolution per se.\n\n105\n00:05:10.178 --> 00:05:13.929\nWe won't get into what resolutions\nreally in pixels per inch and\n\n106\n00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:16.506\nwhat does that mean and 72 versus 300.\n\n107\n00:05:16.506 --> 00:05:19.930\nFor right now about think of\ntotal numbers of pixels and\n\n108\n00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.442\nhow many pixels wide is it and\nhow many pixels high is it.\n\n109\n00:05:23.442 --> 00:05:29.245\nOkay, if I hover over, so\nif I go ahead and select this Bish.jpg.\n\n110\n00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:30.383\nIt's not going to show me my tool tips.\n\n111\n00:05:30.383 --> 00:05:33.768\nI was gonna try to go ahead and\nsee if will, there we go.\n\n112\n00:05:33.768 --> 00:05:35.225\nAll right, it was just a little slow.\n\n113\n00:05:35.225 --> 00:05:37.445\nYou see that this one,\nlook at the dimensions right there.\n\n114\n00:05:37.445 --> 00:05:45.512\nIt says 72x96 versus if I\nhover over this one, 480x640.\n\n115\n00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.599\nWell, what if I hover over this one?\n\n116\n00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:50.124\nSee, this one 3,000 by-\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n117\n00:05:50.124 --> 00:05:54.828\n&gt;&gt; 4,000, right, and\nthat's actually the size, that Fuego and\n\n118\n00:05:54.828 --> 00:05:57.950\nthe tree, our regal lion picture of him.\n\n119\n00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.260\nIt came from my phone and\nthat's the size that the picture is.\n\n120\n00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.700\nAnd so\nyou can see it's got a lot of pixels.\n\n121\n00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.170\nThe more pixels wide and high, the bigger\nthe photograph is going to be for you.\n\n122\n00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:17.490\nAnd a lot more room, if you wanna say, to\nresize it and make it bigger or smaller.\n\n123\n00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.360\nOkay, so that's what we mean by\nresolution and how big the picture is.\n\n124\n00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.576\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Is that Fuego with a hat on?\n\n125\n00:06:24.576 --> 00:06:25.805\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n126\n00:06:25.805 --> 00:06:29.940\n[LAUGH] That's our\ntraditional Christmas cards.\n\n127\n00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.527\nWe dress our cats up and\nwe take our Christmas cards and\n\n128\n00:06:32.527 --> 00:06:34.263\nwe send it to all our friends [LAUGH].\n\n129\n00:06:34.263 --> 00:06:35.962\n&gt;&gt; Frightening and neat at the same time.\n\n130\n00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:38.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's fun.\n\n131\n00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.870\nSo how about we go ahead and\nput that picture in.\n\n132\n00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.160\nSo we'll come back over here to Photoshop.\n\n133\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.930\nThat's not Photoshop, this is PowerPoint.\n\n134\n00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.970\nWe're gonna insert a picture.\n\n135\n00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.568\nI do edit our Christmas\ncards in Photoshop.\n\n136\n00:06:50.568 --> 00:06:54.341\nSo let's go ahead and add Mr Fuego using-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n137\n00:06:54.341 --> 00:06:55.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] He's so happy.\n\n138\n00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.210\nI don't need this right now, thank you.\n\n139\n00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:03.115\nSo he is very, very happy and\nI'm just resizing it.\n\n140\n00:07:03.115 --> 00:07:05.234\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna go ahead and\ndelete this one.\n\n141\n00:07:05.234 --> 00:07:08.498\nJust cuz if you wanted to get rid of\nit you just hit the Delete key, and\n\n142\n00:07:08.498 --> 00:07:10.230\nselect it, delete it.\n\n143\n00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.590\nI think we're gonna go on this\nChristmas thing a little bit more.\n\n144\n00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.628\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and get Mr.\n\n145\n00:07:14.628 --> 00:07:15.759\nBishop in there.\n\n146\n00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:19.072\nSo we're gonna insert our picture and\nyep [LAUGH].\n\n147\n00:07:19.072 --> 00:07:19.922\n&gt;&gt; My.\n\n148\n00:07:19.922 --> 00:07:20.711\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n149\n00:07:20.711 --> 00:07:22.808\nThey're so happy [LAUGH].\n\n150\n00:07:22.808 --> 00:07:24.138\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n151\n00:07:24.138 --> 00:07:25.210\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n152\n00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:30.810\nLet's go ahead and get one more in there\nto demonstrate that concept of resolution.\n\n153\n00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.330\nYou see that this picture\ngoes in a lot smaller, okay.\n\n154\n00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.540\nBut, I want to make it bigger.\n\n155\n00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.680\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nclick, hold and drag.\n\n156\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.220\nI'm gonna make it big.\n\n157\n00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.160\nNotice a difference right there?\n\n158\n00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.300\nThey don't look the same, do they?\n\n159\n00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.210\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No, that-\n\n160\n00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.450\n&gt;&gt; It's all blurry.\n\n161\n00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:45.450\n&gt;&gt; It is, yeah.\n\n162\n00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:46.300\nSo that's the thing.\n\n163\n00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.789\nIf you don't have enough pixel\ninformation to start with,\n\n164\n00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:53.645\nif you try to make it bigger,\nit's just gonna blur the photo out.\n\n165\n00:07:53.645 --> 00:07:57.301\nSo that's just something to keep in mind,\nthat you can do it, but\n\n166\n00:07:57.301 --> 00:07:58.837\nit's not gonna look good.\n\n167\n00:07:58.837 --> 00:08:03.494\nSo try to keep Your images that\nyou want to be really crisp and\n\n168\n00:08:03.494 --> 00:08:07.790\nclear, to be of higher pixel\ndimensions as possible.\n\n169\n00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.560\nSo you have a lot more\nroom to work with it.\n\n170\n00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.590\nNow if I was back here with Bishop and\nI'm just gonna Ctrl+Z to undo,\n\n171\n00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:17.450\nif that's the only size I need my\npicture to be then that's fine.\n\n172\n00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.510\nOkay that's great cuz may be I was gonna\nput this in the bottom corner of my slide\n\n173\n00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.240\nand just have it there.\n\n174\n00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.880\nSo it doesn't really look\nbad at that dimension.\n\n175\n00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.600\nIt's kind hard to see but\nI think we understand now\n\n176\n00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.880\nwhat we're talking about with our size and\neverything.\n\n177\n00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.412\nAll right, so\n\n178\n00:08:34.412 --> 00:08:39.190\nwhat else can we do with our pictures\nonce we've got them into the slide?\n\n179\n00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:44.770\nYou can see that I have the contextual\ntab that has come up on my ribbon for\n\n180\n00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.320\nformatting my pictures.\n\n181\n00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.443\nAnd since I have Flago's picture selected,\nit's given me these options.\n\n182\n00:08:50.443 --> 00:08:52.033\nRemember if I click off of it,\n\n183\n00:08:52.033 --> 00:08:56.376\nit goes away because you've got to be on\nthe item to bring up that contextual tab.\n\n184\n00:08:56.376 --> 00:09:01.354\nThere's a lot of cool things that you can\ndo with formatting images within all of\n\n185\n00:09:01.354 --> 00:09:02.850\nyour Office products.\n\n186\n00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.720\nThis is the same for Word and Excel.\n\n187\n00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.958\nI love where Office started going\nwith how you can customize,\n\n188\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.575\nif you wanna say, your photographs.\n\n189\n00:09:13.575 --> 00:09:20.310\nThis is a lot like your higher end image\ncorrecting software such as Photoshop.\n\n190\n00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:24.562\nA lot of the filters or the artistic\neffects that we're going to see in\n\n191\n00:09:24.562 --> 00:09:27.144\na little bit there filters in Photoshop.\n\n192\n00:09:27.144 --> 00:09:31.080\nSo another thing that I was really happy\nwhen I started seeing this back in the day\n\n193\n00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.901\nwhen this first started coming out,\nit just expanded and\n\n194\n00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:35.850\nwas making me very happy.\n\n195\n00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.460\nAll right, so let's start with the styles.\n\n196\n00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:44.150\nThe kind of overall collection\nof formatting that you can do.\n\n197\n00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:48.210\nAnd if you drop this down,\nyou see it's gone ahead,\n\n198\n00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.620\nit's kind of packaged\na bunch of formats together.\n\n199\n00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.560\nSo you can see that I've got the one\nthat has the little corners,\n\n200\n00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.240\nyou have the little drop shadows,\nyou have the soft edges.\n\n201\n00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.311\nYou have a thick border, you also have\nlike the 3D where it kind of like\n\n202\n00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:06.209\nflattens down, so\nI'm just gonna click on that.\n\n203\n00:10:06.209 --> 00:10:07.350\nIt looks kind of neat.\n\n204\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:11.910\nThose are all things that are built\nin styles that you can apply.\n\n205\n00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.110\nNow let me go ahead and\n\n206\n00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:18.270\nstart with one, maybe we'll go with\nthis thicker border right there.\n\n207\n00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.950\nSo, I like this border,\nit gives like a nice frame, but\n\n208\n00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.740\nwhat about modifying,\nI could start with style and\n\n209\n00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.600\nthen what if I wanted to go ahead and\nchange some of those things.\n\n210\n00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.320\nOver on the left hand, that would be\nthe other left, that would be the right,\n\n211\n00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.000\nof the picture styles group.\n\n212\n00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.270\nNow I can go ahead and add or\nchange the border color.\n\n213\n00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.330\nMaybe I wanna make it\nlike this green color.\n\n214\n00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.560\nOr another one.\n\n215\n00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.850\nThis is where we did the eye dropper in\nselecting colors with text, this is where\n\n216\n00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.430\nyou could go ahead and I wanna match\nthe frame to a color in the picture.\n\n217\n00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:52.330\nYou can choose the eye dropper and\nhover over any of these colors in\n\n218\n00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.060\nthe photograph and say maybe I want\nthis kind of pink color there,\n\n219\n00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.670\nyou click and\nnow I've got a pink border right there.\n\n220\n00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.350\nYou can go through and change all\nthe different things like the weight.\n\n221\n00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:05.100\nMaybe you don't want to be that thick or\nyou want it to be thinner.\n\n222\n00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.760\nYou could change that.\n\n223\n00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.359\nSo that's where you could\nchange the picture border.\n\n224\n00:11:09.359 --> 00:11:12.650\nThe effects, lots of different effects.\n\n225\n00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.820\nNow, I'm not gonna go through\nevery single one of them,\n\n226\n00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:19.610\nwe'll probably be here for many,\nmany hours out of all the combinations.\n\n227\n00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:24.020\nBut, I just wanted to go through a few of\nthem to where the shadow, if you wanted to\n\n228\n00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.630\nchange the shadow, and it gives you all\nof those live previews that you can see.\n\n229\n00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.470\nThe reflection,\nhow do I want it to reflect?\n\n230\n00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:32.170\nThe glow.\n\n231\n00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.840\nDo I want it to have a soft\nglow around the edges?\n\n232\n00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.542\nAll of the different things\nthat you can go through,\n\n233\n00:11:39.542 --> 00:11:44.526\nbevel, 3D rotation, and it has all\nof those previews that you have.\n\n234\n00:11:44.526 --> 00:11:47.713\nOkay, now we're getting a little crazy,\n[LAUGH] but\n\n235\n00:11:47.713 --> 00:11:52.600\nyou can go through all the different\noptions there and modify them.\n\n236\n00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.170\nFantastic, all right.\n\n237\n00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.457\nLet's go over to some other\noptions that you can do.\n\n238\n00:11:56.457 --> 00:11:58.908\nI went ahead and selected bishop.\n\n239\n00:11:58.908 --> 00:12:02.217\nOver here on the left hand side,\nyou have the adjustment and\n\n240\n00:12:02.217 --> 00:12:06.649\nthis is where you really start to get in\nto the different things that those higher\n\n241\n00:12:06.649 --> 00:12:09.052\nend image adjustments software would do.\n\n242\n00:12:09.052 --> 00:12:11.650\nThe artistic effects, okay?\n\n243\n00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.222\nI want to make it look blurry.\n\n244\n00:12:14.222 --> 00:12:18.230\n[LAUGH] I'm not exactly sure why I wanna\ndo that right now because you want to blur\n\n245\n00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:23.310\nlittle Bishop's face, but it's really neat\nhow you can apply all of these different,\n\n246\n00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:27.028\nlike the pastels and ooh,\nthe plastic wrap right?\n\n247\n00:12:27.028 --> 00:12:29.533\n[LAUGH] Glowing edges?\n\n248\n00:12:29.533 --> 00:12:30.795\nThat's a little scary.\n\n249\n00:12:30.795 --> 00:12:33.917\n[LAUGH] But just try it.\n\n250\n00:12:33.917 --> 00:12:35.970\nPick them out and\nsee which ones you wanna do.\n\n251\n00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:41.627\nMaybe I'll go with,\nmaybe I won't go with the glowing edges,\n\n252\n00:12:41.627 --> 00:12:46.536\nand I like that you can layer\nall of these things now that\n\n253\n00:12:46.536 --> 00:12:50.731\nyou wanna do the artist effects and\nthe color.\n\n254\n00:12:50.731 --> 00:12:54.733\nIf you want, it just depends on what, to\nme it's just like just start going on it,\n\n255\n00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:57.320\njust start clicking on it,\nsee what it looks like.\n\n256\n00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:02.000\nI'm really starting to not like his eyes\nin this, so let's go to the reset picture.\n\n257\n00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.120\nThat's always a nice one, right there.\n\n258\n00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.480\nYou can go ahead and reset the picture.\n\n259\n00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.970\nThere is a drop-down where\nit has picture and size.\n\n260\n00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:13.040\nIf I had made it smaller,\nI could always choose that option.\n\n261\n00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.040\nI'm just gonna say reset it all,\nand there we go.\n\n262\n00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.060\nNow, we have our cute little\nBishop back in there.\n\n263\n00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.046\nBut you can go into\nchange the brightness and\n\n264\n00:13:22.046 --> 00:13:26.414\nthe contrast in your photograph\nmay be brighted up a little bit.\n\n265\n00:13:26.414 --> 00:13:27.653\nThat's pretty good.\n\n266\n00:13:27.653 --> 00:13:32.460\nAnd yes we have a color artistic, awesome.\n\n267\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.692\nWe did our other buttons\nwhich would be our reset.\n\n268\n00:13:35.692 --> 00:13:40.080\nThere is one like just to show the rest\nof buttons in the is a change picture.\n\n269\n00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.900\nWhich would mean like, maybe, or\nthis one might be a good example.\n\n270\n00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:50.010\nI really like the frame that I added,\nI like the drop shadow, but\n\n271\n00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:55.580\nI wanna change the photograph and\nretain all of the formats that I had done.\n\n272\n00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.520\nSo I could click on the change picture.\n\n273\n00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:03.470\nI do want to insert it from File and\nmay be I will take this one.\n\n274\n00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.980\nAnd now, you can see that all of the\nformatting that I did to the photograph,\n\n275\n00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:09.805\naren't they cute?\n\n276\n00:14:09.805 --> 00:14:11.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They do love each other.\n\n277\n00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.670\nEven though, they can fight sometimes,\nI just think that's a really cute picture.\n\n278\n00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne,\n\n279\n00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:21.510\nwhat about over on the right-hand\nside of our ribbon up there?\n\n280\n00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.724\nThe idea of using crop, when would\nI need to do something like that?\n\n281\n00:14:24.724 --> 00:14:25.361\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n282\n00:14:25.361 --> 00:14:27.950\nSo maybe I had this picture of Bishop.\n\n283\n00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:31.470\nAnd right now it's more of a portrait.\n\n284\n00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.390\nAspect ratio, so\nmaybe I wanna make it more square.\n\n285\n00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:39.690\nI don't need all of this extra\npart of the photograph, so here,\n\n286\n00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.450\nlet's move them over so\nyou can see him a little better.\n\n287\n00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:46.990\nI want to crop that, that's what\ncropping means, just remove parts of it.\n\n288\n00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:51.146\nSo, I have the picture selected and\nI am gonna come over here to crop and\n\n289\n00:14:51.146 --> 00:14:52.771\nI am going to click on crop.\n\n290\n00:14:52.771 --> 00:14:57.400\nAnd now I've got\nthe cropping re-handle bars.\n\n291\n00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.170\nWe'll go with that [LAUGH].\n\n292\n00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:01.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You need to make it look like, okay,\n\n293\n00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.710\nsee how it looks almost\nlike a little pusher, okay,\n\n294\n00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.010\nas opposed to the two point arrows.\n\n295\n00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:06.530\nYou don't want that.\n\n296\n00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:13.960\nWe want to actually change where\nthe visual area of the picture changes.\n\n297\n00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.080\nThat's what we want to crop, okay?\n\n298\n00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.350\nSo make sure you look for that icon.\n\n299\n00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.720\nAnd it's kind of grayed out,\nso that's good.\n\n300\n00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.866\nAnd if I just click off,\nyou can see that, now,\n\n301\n00:15:22.866 --> 00:15:25.801\nit's removed that part of the photograph.\n\n302\n00:15:25.801 --> 00:15:27.670\nIt's not really gone.\n\n303\n00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:28.890\nIt's just hiding.\n\n304\n00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:33.530\nIt's almost like you're putting it in\na picture frame with a mat on top of it.\n\n305\n00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:38.330\nSo, the information still lives there,\nyou just have said don't see it.\n\n306\n00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:41.460\nAnd since I was talking about cropping.\n\n307\n00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.782\nYou do have crop to shape, I don't\nknow if any of you all notice that and\n\n308\n00:15:45.782 --> 00:15:49.133\nare like let me see that, look at that.\n\n309\n00:15:49.133 --> 00:15:50.377\n&gt;&gt; My.\n\n310\n00:15:50.377 --> 00:15:55.658\n&gt;&gt; So cute and we can still go ahead and\napply our different borders.\n\n311\n00:15:55.658 --> 00:15:59.281\nTo the photograph and\nchange all the different things to it,\n\n312\n00:15:59.281 --> 00:16:02.330\ncuz maybe you just wanna go ahead and\ndo that.\n\n313\n00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:03.280\nMy cute little picture.\n\n314\n00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.980\n[LAUGH] So\nthat's the cropping that you can do.\n\n315\n00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:10.949\nBut again, if you ever mess up,\nyou can always go back and\n\n316\n00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:16.103\nreset the photograph and start from\nscratch, and you can go on with that.\n\n317\n00:16:16.103 --> 00:16:21.180\nNow, talking about the size\nof the images that you have.\n\n318\n00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.960\nIf you have one slide and\nyou're adding a large picture and\n\n319\n00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.150\nyou're sizing it down, that would be\nfine if you use it here and there.\n\n320\n00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:34.660\nBut what if you have 100 slides, and you\nhave 100 images, and they all are really,\n\n321\n00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.580\nreally big pictures, but\nyou made them smaller slides?\n\n322\n00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.574\nYou could run into where you're gonna\nhave a very large PowerPoint file.\n\n323\n00:16:42.574 --> 00:16:46.399\nAnd that might be something you\ndon't want cuz it might start to bog\n\n324\n00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:50.440\ndown your machine, maybe is starts\nto really take a long time to open.\n\n325\n00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.631\nI've had images where\nthey're huge images but\n\n326\n00:16:53.631 --> 00:16:56.680\nthey only occupy this much of the slide.\n\n327\n00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.040\nSo you can do is compress the images.\n\n328\n00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.068\nAnd that where it's like I don't\nneed all of that extra information.\n\n329\n00:17:04.068 --> 00:17:05.550\nI wanna make them smaller.\n\n330\n00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.540\nAnd that will optimize,\nthey call it, your file size.\n\n331\n00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.420\nAnd it will make it\na little less cumbersome.\n\n332\n00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.624\nDo you have to do this?\n\n333\n00:17:13.624 --> 00:17:15.380\nIt's really up to you.\n\n334\n00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.727\nI have had to do that where\nI've just two gig file,\n\n335\n00:17:18.727 --> 00:17:24.321\nI mean I might be over exaggerating here,\n[LAUGH] but it's just really large files.\n\n336\n00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:27.730\nSo if you go into having\nthe picture selected,\n\n337\n00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:31.470\nyou can go into this button right\nhere where it says Compress Picture.\n\n338\n00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:34.430\nAnd notice that I have\nused default resolution,\n\n339\n00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.810\nthat would be all of\nthose pixels in there.\n\n340\n00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:43.520\nThe smallest one you could go with, not\nto try to get into the whole PPI thing,\n\n341\n00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.880\nreally, just think the bigger the number,\nthe bigger the picture.\n\n342\n00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.220\nSo I'm gonna go with the email,\neven if I'm not emailing it.\n\n343\n00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.980\nIt's just going to make\nthe images smaller.\n\n344\n00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.720\nAnd notice up here if\nI had used that crop,\n\n345\n00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.600\nI'm going to delete the cropped areas and\nit's applying only to this picture.\n\n346\n00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.940\nAnd this is where if you had 100 pictures\nacross all of your presentation,\n\n347\n00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.310\nthe nice thing is you choose one and\nthen uncheck that Apply to All.\n\n348\n00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:11.690\nIt'll uncheck Apply Only, it will do\nthe opposite, which would apply to all.\n\n349\n00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.495\nSo that's kind of the nice little feature.\n\n350\n00:18:13.495 --> 00:18:14.725\nAnd you click Okay.\n\n351\n00:18:14.725 --> 00:18:19.247\nAnd then it doesn't do anything visually\nto the quality of the picture because it's\n\n352\n00:18:19.247 --> 00:18:20.655\nthe size you want it to be.\n\n353\n00:18:20.655 --> 00:18:24.057\nOne thing on that compressed image I just\nwant to demonstrate really quickly on\n\n354\n00:18:24.057 --> 00:18:24.735\nthis picture.\n\n355\n00:18:24.735 --> 00:18:27.025\nRemember this is our small photograph.\n\n356\n00:18:27.025 --> 00:18:28.495\nBut I go into compress.\n\n357\n00:18:28.495 --> 00:18:30.095\nSee everything is grayed out?\n\n358\n00:18:30.095 --> 00:18:33.985\nBecause it doesn't even have\nthe option to make smaller.\n\n359\n00:18:33.985 --> 00:18:36.310\nIt's already small.\n\n360\n00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:40.060\nSo you're only going to\nget these compression\n\n361\n00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.170\noptions if you're using large files.\n\n362\n00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.890\nSo something to notice.\n\n363\n00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:49.820\nAll right, well what if I have pictures,\nthat I need pictures.\n\n364\n00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:55.423\nAnd I don't have pictures of Fuego or\nBishop but I need a picture of a cat.\n\n365\n00:18:55.423 --> 00:18:58.453\nWell, you can go to\nthe handy dandy Internet.\n\n366\n00:18:58.453 --> 00:19:00.157\nSo I just clicked off of everything.\n\n367\n00:19:00.157 --> 00:19:02.106\nYou go to Insert.\n\n368\n00:19:02.106 --> 00:19:04.621\nAnd we're gonna go to Online Pictures.\n\n369\n00:19:04.621 --> 00:19:07.633\nAnd when you go to your online pictures\nwe're going to do an image search.\n\n370\n00:19:07.633 --> 00:19:09.373\nWhat do you think we're gonna search for,\nRonnie?\n\n371\n00:19:09.373 --> 00:19:11.061\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say cats.\n\n372\n00:19:11.061 --> 00:19:14.629\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so why don't we go ahead and\nsearch for some cats.\n\n373\n00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.710\nOkay.\nAnd here you go.\n\n374\n00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:20.808\nLook at all these little babies.\n\n375\n00:19:20.808 --> 00:19:27.630\nQuick note, I would research a little bit\nabout this whole creative common licenses.\n\n376\n00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.580\nCuz right now it is showing\nyou those that will allow you.\n\n377\n00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:33.790\nCuz you are going onto\nthe Internet to find images.\n\n378\n00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.240\nAnd it will default to the creative\ncommons license only so\n\n379\n00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.080\nyou are allowed to use these photographs.\n\n380\n00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.950\nIf you take that off in show results you\ncould be using pictures that you don't\n\n381\n00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.730\nhave the permission to do so.\n\n382\n00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.640\nSo just be a little careful about that.\n\n383\n00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.288\nI always keep it on this and\njust go with that.\n\n384\n00:19:50.288 --> 00:19:52.510\nAll right,\n[LAUGH] that's a pretty cute picture.\n\n385\n00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.350\nLet's scroll down and\nsee some other ones through here.\n\n386\n00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.800\nAnd Ronnie,\nyou just tell me one that pops out to you.\n\n387\n00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.145\n&gt;&gt; The one beside the no cat.\n\n388\n00:20:01.145 --> 00:20:02.665\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Our scaredy cat?\n\n389\n00:20:02.665 --> 00:20:03.810\n&gt;&gt; Yes, why not?\n\n390\n00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's go with scaredy cat.\n\n391\n00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.480\nSo we'll go ahead and click on that\nguy and see I'm just selecting it.\n\n392\n00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.070\nCuz you could select multiple ones\nif I wanted this one, this one, and\n\n393\n00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.470\nthis one, I could select multiples.\n\n394\n00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:17.220\nBut since we're just gonna go ahead and\n\n395\n00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.270\nget this one scaredy cat cuz he might\nnot like some other ones, right.\n\n396\n00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:23.835\nSo [LAUGH] we'll go ahead and\ninsert this guy, and-\n\n397\n00:20:23.835 --> 00:20:25.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n398\n00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:26.715\n&gt;&gt; Here's our scaredy cat.\n\n399\n00:20:26.715 --> 00:20:27.930\n[LAUGH] You like that?\n\n400\n00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:29.043\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n401\n00:20:29.043 --> 00:20:30.775\n&gt;&gt; That should be my logo.\n\n402\n00:20:30.775 --> 00:20:33.912\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My personal logo.\n\n403\n00:20:33.912 --> 00:20:35.505\n&gt;&gt; That would be pretty good.\n\n404\n00:20:35.505 --> 00:20:37.690\n[LAUGH] So we got our scaredy cat in.\n\n405\n00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:41.000\nWe went ahead and found a picture from\nthe Internet and we put it in there.\n\n406\n00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.820\nAll right, wonderful.\n\n407\n00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:43.775\nIt looks like top of my hair.\n\n408\n00:20:43.775 --> 00:20:46.053\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, doesn't it?\n\n409\n00:20:46.053 --> 00:20:46.996\nThat's a little weird.\n\n410\n00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:47.860\n&gt;&gt; You guys are kindred spirits.\n\n411\n00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.664\n&gt;&gt; I know we are.\n\n412\n00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:51.742\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Awesome.\n\n413\n00:20:51.742 --> 00:20:55.354\nSo we've got some pictures and you can do\nall the same formatting that we did for\n\n414\n00:20:55.354 --> 00:20:57.999\nour radio photographs,\nyou can do the same things here.\n\n415\n00:20:57.999 --> 00:21:01.490\nI don't wanna go through all of these\noptions, cuz you've already seen me do it.\n\n416\n00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:07.763\nBut this is to demonstrate something else,\nnotice if I did the picture border,\n\n417\n00:21:07.763 --> 00:21:11.988\nor if there is this white\nbackground around this cat.\n\n418\n00:21:11.988 --> 00:21:17.120\nPutting this into a slide that has a white\nbackground isn't that big of a deal.\n\n419\n00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.900\nBut what if I'm putting it into\na slide that has a colored background.\n\n420\n00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.886\nWhen we start getting\ninto our design themes.\n\n421\n00:21:21.886 --> 00:21:25.170\nThis could be a problem.\n\n422\n00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.590\nWell, luckily PowerPoint will allow\nus to remove that background and\n\n423\n00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:29.880\nit's pretty awesome.\n\n424\n00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.450\nBefore I get into that I just want to do a\nquick point out of this particular slide.\n\n425\n00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:36.800\nBecause when I selected that scaredy cat\n\n426\n00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:41.330\nphotograph there are different types of\nfiles when you're working with images.\n\n427\n00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.900\nCuz you might find a picture\nfrom the Internet that\n\n428\n00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.300\nlooks like that scaredy cat that\ndoesn't have a white background.\n\n429\n00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.277\nSo how is one having one versus the other?\n\n430\n00:21:49.277 --> 00:21:54.140\nIt could be the way that\nthe file is saved in its format.\n\n431\n00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:59.369\nAnd I put in there a JPEG, which is these\nare ones that you might have heard.\n\n432\n00:21:59.369 --> 00:22:03.110\nCuz with our smart phones and\neverything we have all these pictures.\n\n433\n00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:07.120\nJPEG is like for photographs that\nhas support of millions of colors.\n\n434\n00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.890\nIt does not support transparency though.\n\n435\n00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.960\nSo could be that there are little\nscardy cat was save as a JPEG.\n\n436\n00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.440\nSo, didn't allow for that transparency\nto where it's just join the black and\n\n437\n00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.940\nnot the white box.\n\n438\n00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:20.055\nUsually the white box is where, yes,\nI know what your talking about.\n\n439\n00:22:20.055 --> 00:22:25.400\nGIFs is where you have less color support,\nbut it can support transparency.\n\n440\n00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.110\nAnd your PNGs,\nyour portable network graphic,\n\n441\n00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:32.940\nit can act almost like both a JPEG and\na GIF.\n\n442\n00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.887\nIt has the support of 65,536,\n\n443\n00:22:36.887 --> 00:22:41.864\nand it also has\nthe transparency port of a GIF.\n\n444\n00:22:41.864 --> 00:22:44.280\nCuz usually, GIF only supports 256 colors.\n\n445\n00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.200\nSorry, I know these numbers.\n\n446\n00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:47.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n447\n00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.470\n&gt;&gt; And it can actually support\n\n448\n00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:54.170\nmultiple levels of transparencies and\nnot just a one-bit transparency,\n\n449\n00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:57.380\neight-bit transparency.\nWay more than you need to know about but\n\n450\n00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.560\nI just wanted to at least\nthrow that out there.\n\n451\n00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.170\nThat different file formats\nsupport different features.\n\n452\n00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.080\nOkay.\n\n453\n00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.740\nSo, what about that white background part?\n\n454\n00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:09.708\nIf I have a scaredy cat,\nlet's go ahead and copy this little guy.\n\n455\n00:23:09.708 --> 00:23:12.790\nAnd we're gonna bring it into this slide,\nand we're gonna paste it.\n\n456\n00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:13.810\nWhoops, that's the wrong key.\n\n457\n00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.630\nHow about we go ahead and\nget the control key?\n\n458\n00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:16.330\nThere we go.\n\n459\n00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.440\nAnd so, we've got the scaredy cat.\n\n460\n00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.910\nI'm gonna take off that drop shadow, so\n\n461\n00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:25.760\nI'm gonna just go ahead and do the reset\npicture, quick easy way to do it.\n\n462\n00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:30.236\nSo, I do not want it to have\nthat white background there.\n\n463\n00:23:30.236 --> 00:23:34.023\nSo, what I can do is if I select\na picture, go over to the Format tab,\n\n464\n00:23:34.023 --> 00:23:36.690\nthey have the Remove Background.\n\n465\n00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:37.620\nIf I click on this, now,\n\n466\n00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:43.270\nthis is gonna work really well\nwith uniform colors to remove.\n\n467\n00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:47.040\nThe more detail the photograph, it's gonna\nstart get a little bit more complicated.\n\n468\n00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.398\nBut at least you can do this\nwith this particular photograph.\n\n469\n00:23:51.398 --> 00:23:55.120\nSo now you can see I've clicked\nit Anywhere where it's pink.\n\n470\n00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.907\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Is going to [LAUGH] is\n\n471\n00:23:56.907 --> 00:23:58.730\ngoing to remove that background.\n\n472\n00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:59.832\n&gt;&gt; He looks scareder now.\n\n473\n00:23:59.832 --> 00:24:00.876\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] He does, doesn't he?\n\n474\n00:24:00.876 --> 00:24:01.378\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Does he?\n\n475\n00:24:01.378 --> 00:24:02.738\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Like those pink eyes.\n\n476\n00:24:02.738 --> 00:24:03.246\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n477\n00:24:03.246 --> 00:24:04.188\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\n\n478\n00:24:04.188 --> 00:24:06.070\nso, that's actually a perfect point.\n\n479\n00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I don't want his eyes to be\n\n480\n00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:10.020\ntransparent.\n\n481\n00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.070\nI want his eyes to be white, but\n\n482\n00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:14.950\neverything else around\nhim to not be white.\n\n483\n00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:19.380\nAnd it is kinda seeing all the white, but\nyou notice this internal box of where\n\n484\n00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:22.240\nit's determining where to\nremove the background?\n\n485\n00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.540\nThat's something that I could go ahead and\nextend all the way out.\n\n486\n00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.308\nWith this picture,\nit's doing it automatically.\n\n487\n00:24:26.308 --> 00:24:28.730\nSo it's fine, I'm gonna zoom\nin just a little bit more so\n\n488\n00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.890\nwe can see this a little bit better.\n\n489\n00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:34.060\nSo anywhere where it's pink, it's going to\nmark areas where you want it to remove.\n\n490\n00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.110\nAnd actually, sorry.\n\n491\n00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:40.150\nI do want to get that box all the way out,\nbecause otherwise it's actually cropping.\n\n492\n00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:43.600\nSo I don't want it to remove\nparts that I want to keep.\n\n493\n00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.750\nSo make sure you've got that\nbox in the area that you want.\n\n494\n00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.370\nAreas to keep.\n\n495\n00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.450\nI need to mark those spaces like no,\ndon't take that out.\n\n496\n00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:53.250\nSo I click on this.\n\n497\n00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:54.980\nIt's like I've got my little pen alright?\n\n498\n00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.500\nAnd I can just click around his eyes.\n\n499\n00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.100\nAnd you see how it's going to detect.\n\n500\n00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:01.948\nLike.\n\n501\n00:25:01.948 --> 00:25:07.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We've got some double eyes.\n\n502\n00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.160\n&gt;&gt; He really looks scareder now.\n\n503\n00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.305\n&gt;&gt; He really does.\n\n504\n00:25:09.305 --> 00:25:14.920\n[LAUGH] So we should probably say yes\nbefore we get any more creeped out.\n\n505\n00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.370\nBut it's saying like, you want this part?\n\n506\n00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:20.095\nOkay, I'll keep it to whatever\ncolor it had originated,\n\n507\n00:25:20.095 --> 00:25:22.445\nbecause this could be blue.\n\n508\n00:25:22.445 --> 00:25:25.855\nIt could be a blue background with blue\neyes and we could be removing backwards.\n\n509\n00:25:25.855 --> 00:25:26.795\nSo it doesn't have to be white.\n\n510\n00:25:26.795 --> 00:25:28.385\nI want to emphasize\nthat point right there,\n\n511\n00:25:28.385 --> 00:25:32.345\nit's just removing parts that I do\nnot want regardless of the color.\n\n512\n00:25:32.345 --> 00:25:34.895\nBut uniformity is gonna\nbe the easiest way.\n\n513\n00:25:34.895 --> 00:25:37.210\nI say, yep,\nI want to keep all those changes.\n\n514\n00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:40.000\nAnd then I go ahead and\nchange it, and then, there we go,\n\n515\n00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.170\nnow we've got a kitty cat\nwithout his background, but\n\n516\n00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:47.490\nhe's still scared and\nhe's still got his bug eyes going.\n\n517\n00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:53.010\nBut, then you can go ahead and apply all\nof the different effects that you wanted.\n\n518\n00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.329\nI mean, we could make him a different.\n\n519\n00:25:55.329 --> 00:25:55.861\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n520\n00:25:55.861 --> 00:25:56.592\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Or\n\n521\n00:25:56.592 --> 00:26:00.566\nI can just keep on making\nthem really scared.\n\n522\n00:26:00.566 --> 00:26:04.440\nAll right, so, fun with images,\nit's pretty awesome.\n\n523\n00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:08.965\nOne last thing I wanted to point out, and\nthis is in relationship to text wrap,\n\n524\n00:26:08.965 --> 00:26:12.810\nbecause if you're a Word user, and you're\ncoming over from Word into PowerPoint,\n\n525\n00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.730\nthis is something that I do use a lot.\n\n526\n00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.100\nIs the text wrap around an image.\n\n527\n00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.460\nSo let's take this guy.\n\n528\n00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.444\nLet's go ahead a copy him.\n\n529\n00:26:21.444 --> 00:26:24.476\nWe'll coming over to this slide and\nI'm just going to paste.\n\n530\n00:26:24.476 --> 00:26:26.420\nI keep hitting the wrong key.\n\n531\n00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.780\nThere we go.\n\n532\n00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:33.850\nIn word in the format, you would have It\nlooks almost like a little dog, okay and\n\n533\n00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:37.650\nwhere it wraps the text around the image,\nthat doesn't exist in Powerpoint.\n\n534\n00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:39.190\nSo you don't have that option.\n\n535\n00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:43.020\nSo if I wanted to take this text and\nwrap it around the picture,\n\n536\n00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:49.260\nI would have to change the size of the box\n\n537\n00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:54.560\nhere to wrap it around this\ncat in a different way.\n\n538\n00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:59.270\nSo I just wanted to point that out,\nyou might have to get creative where,\n\n539\n00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.870\nwell I want this paragraph to be over, but\n\n540\n00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:06.140\nthen this paragraph to be long,\nlike underneath it.\n\n541\n00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.260\nWell then you would have to take\nthat into two separate text boxes.\n\n542\n00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:12.550\nJust really quickly I'm just gonna go\nahead and take this I would cut that out,\n\n543\n00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:19.500\ngo ahead and change the size of this,\ngo into insert a New Text box,\n\n544\n00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:24.350\nand then make the Text Box here,\npaste the text into there.\n\n545\n00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:28.600\nLet's go ahead and just paste it back\ninto the same formatting paste options.\n\n546\n00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:30.350\nLove them.\n\n547\n00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:35.270\nSo now I've kind of given the illusion\nif you wanna say that this cat does\n\n548\n00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:40.440\nhave the text wrap around it,\nbut I had to split this into\n\n549\n00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:45.825\ntwo separate text containers to create\nthat look that I had in my mind.\n\n550\n00:27:45.825 --> 00:27:48.370\n[LAUGH] And this is what I\nwanted it to really look like.\n\n551\n00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:51.220\nSo text wrap now supported in Powerpoint.\n\n552\n00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:52.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne.\n\n553\n00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:55.310\nWell that's a lot of images for\nus to think about.\n\n554\n00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.090\nEspecially when we get into PowerPoint.\n\n555\n00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.260\nSometimes you might think that\nyou need to insert in more.\n\n556\n00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.970\nSometimes you're not exactly sure.\n\n557\n00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:04.410\nBut overall though what Vonne\nshowed us here in this episode\n\n558\n00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.290\nis how to actually insert the images.\n\n559\n00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:10.340\nEither from a file or also of course\nfrom well, the internet as we saw.\n\n560\n00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:14.620\nIf you are getting these pictures and they\nhave extra background into it, notice that\n\n561\n00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:18.630\nYvonne also showed us how to remove that\nbackground as well, that we can make it,\n\n562\n00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:22.850\nyou know, more in line with what we have,\ninside of Powerpoint 2.\n\n563\n00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:26.018\nRemember to take a look at these\nparticular options that are available\n\n564\n00:28:26.018 --> 00:28:27.414\nbecause you can manipulate and\n\n565\n00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:30.165\nchange everything that you can\nthink of in a picture as well.\n\n566\n00:28:30.165 --> 00:28:32.690\nAnd I'm trying to remember everything,\ncompression.\n\n567\n00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:37.610\nSometimes images are larger than they seem\nand if they are there gonna make your\n\n568\n00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:41.750\nPowerpoint file much larger and it may\nmake the machine run a little bit slower\n\n569\n00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.800\nas it has to compile and\ndo everything else that it needs to.\n\n570\n00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.460\nBut overall though images do help\nto make the impact that we need.\n\n571\n00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.920\nAlong with the right words it will\nmake a very powerful PowerPoint for\n\n572\n00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.070\nus to be able to present.\n\n573\n00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:55.950\nThank you again, Vaughn, for\nshowing us more about PowerPoint, and\n\n574\n00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.790\nthank you also for watching.\n\n575\n00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:59.780\nThis is a great place for us to sign off.\n\n576\n00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.130\nFor ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host,

Vonne demonstrates how to apply a theme and modify a theme too.  She also demonstrates different elements that can be changed to create our own theme if we choose.  She uses a background color with a theme to show how we can create a custom theme that can be saved and used again later.  Lastly, she shows a new feature, with office 365,  the design ideas that helps you to get started with PointPoint appeal.",

Thank you for having me.\n\n11\n00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.920\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne, as we get started here,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n12\n00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.860\nmake sure that we understand some\ndifferences, if there are any differences.\n\n13\n00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.060\nYou'll have to correct me on this or not.\n\n14\n00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.090\nWe've already applied formatting, so\n\n15\n00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.790\nwhat in the world are themes when\nwe're talking about styles and\n\n16\n00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.460\nthemes or formatting slides and\nthemes, what are we talking about?\n\n17\n00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.540\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, we have been doing a lot of\nformatting in some of our other episodes.\n\n18\n00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.490\nWe were formatting text where\nwe were making it look different\n\n19\n00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.860\nwith our fonts and our colors.\n\n20\n00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.585\nAnd we were formatting our objects\nwith our text or placeholders,\n\n21\n00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:04.247\nof changing the size of them,\n\n22\n00:01:04.247 --> 00:01:09.640\nmoving them around with the whole\nfour-point arrow and everything like that.\n\n23\n00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.450\nSo, we're basically gonna just continue\non with that same theme, [LAUGH].\n\n24\n00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.940\nAnd we're going to be changing\neverything up, but in this place,\n\n25\n00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.050\nwhat we're going to look at, is the entire\npresentation, all of the slides.\n\n26\n00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.890\nAnd, we're going to be\napplying design themes.\n\n27\n00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.735\nAnd what a theme is, think about if\nyou're going to be throwing a party and\n\n28\n00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:30.923\nthe party has a theme.\n\n29\n00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:34.160\nLike if I was going to throw\na My Little Pony party, right?\n\n30\n00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.997\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; I'd buy all the plates and the cups,\n\n31\n00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:42.238\nand I'd have some like some pink napkins\nand maybe some purple confetti around,\n\n32\n00:01:42.238 --> 00:01:45.963\ncuz everything needs to have\na consistent look and feel.\n\n33\n00:01:45.963 --> 00:01:49.074\nAnd that's the same thing we\nare going to do with our slides,\n\n34\n00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:50.570\nwith our design themes.\n\n35\n00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.670\nIt formats everything,\nand it's pretty awesome.\n\n36\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.833\nAnd the design themes that come pre-made\nwith PowerPoint are really nice looking.\n\n37\n00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:00.026\nAnd then,\nwhat we're gonna do is say, well,\n\n38\n00:02:00.026 --> 00:02:02.783\nwhat if I don't wanna go with\nwhat they're giving me, and\n\n39\n00:02:02.783 --> 00:02:06.249\nI want to put in my own picture for\nthe background, or a different color?\n\n40\n00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:10.722\nThen we've got to format the background,\nspecifically of our slides and\n\n41\n00:02:10.722 --> 00:02:11.958\nmove on from there.\n\n42\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.727\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne,\nit sounds fairly complex.\n\n43\n00:02:14.727 --> 00:02:17.085\nI'm not a big partygoer,\nas you know, Vonne.\n\n44\n00:02:17.085 --> 00:02:17.594\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n45\n00:02:17.594 --> 00:02:21.274\nthe idea of actually having a theme for\na party sounds overwhelming.\n\n46\n00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:24.464\nBut, Vonne, is applying then themes\nto what we're talking about,\n\n47\n00:02:24.464 --> 00:02:28.149\nis that something difficult that we really\nhave to kind of, have to put together\n\n48\n00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:32.360\nevery element before we apply, or is this\nsomething that really is easy to do?\n\n49\n00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.770\n&gt;&gt; It's one-click.\n\n50\n00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.860\n&gt;&gt; Well that makes it easy.\n\n51\n00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.449\n&gt;&gt; Yes, all right.\n\n52\n00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:36.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm gonna go ahead and jump in.\n\n53\n00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.112\nI'll show you how easy it is, Ronnie.\n\n54\n00:02:38.112 --> 00:02:38.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n55\n00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.727\n&gt;&gt; And then, maybe you won't be so\n\n56\n00:02:39.727 --> 00:02:41.593\nscared about throwing up\na PowerPoint party, right?\n\n57\n00:02:41.593 --> 00:02:42.893\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly what I want to do.\n\n58\n00:02:42.893 --> 00:02:45.343\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; PowerPoint party.\n\n59\n00:02:45.343 --> 00:02:45.890\n[LAUGH].\n\n60\n00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.785\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, all right, let's go ahead and\njump into this folder.\n\n61\n00:02:48.785 --> 00:02:49.931\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can't wait to actually\n\n62\n00:02:49.931 --> 00:02:52.238\nfigure out who I'm inviting\nto a PowerPoint party.\n\n63\n00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:54.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I hope you invite me.\n\n64\n00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.254\nI can help you.\n\n65\n00:02:55.254 --> 00:02:56.079\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nAbsolutely.\n\n66\n00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I've got a presentation\n\n67\n00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.288\ncalled formatting slides and\nthemes in our PowerPoint folder.\n\n68\n00:03:04.288 --> 00:03:08.240\nSo, I'm just gonna go ahead and\nopen up the product right from that file.\n\n69\n00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.210\nAnd you can see this is what we've really\nbeen working with this whole time,\n\n70\n00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.040\nis just these kind of basic\nwhite slides with black text.\n\n71\n00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.520\nThere's nothing really\nfancy going on with them.\n\n72\n00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.289\nCuz we've just been doing everything out\nof the box, just so we can get familiar\n\n73\n00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:26.847\nwith adding these different elements\ninto our PowerPoint presentation.\n\n74\n00:03:26.847 --> 00:03:28.921\nSo, in this particular presentation,\n\n75\n00:03:28.921 --> 00:03:32.461\nI have a title slide because we've\ngone over our different layouts.\n\n76\n00:03:32.461 --> 00:03:35.676\nI have a title and content slide.\n\n77\n00:03:35.676 --> 00:03:40.050\nI did went ahead and put in these colored\nshapes here, just for now, because we're\n\n78\n00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.110\ngonna be doing shapes in another\nepisode of how to actually get them in.\n\n79\n00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.670\nBut I really wanted to emphasize and\nshow you how the whole idea of\n\n80\n00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.690\nthe colors that come in with\nthe design theme, are going to work.\n\n81\n00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.330\nAnd then, another title content.\n\n82\n00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.730\nTitle and comparison, and\nthen I have a section layout.\n\n83\n00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.150\nAnd, you can tell which layout I have.\n\n84\n00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.497\nThat is because, it's highlighted there\nwhen I actually dropdown the layout.\n\n85\n00:04:01.497 --> 00:04:06.184\nSo, The whole idea back on the slide\ntwo is that when you're de-ply,\n\n86\n00:04:06.184 --> 00:04:07.461\nwhen you de-ply?\n\n87\n00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:11.239\n[LAUGH] When you deploy or apply,\nI think that was well I was going for,\n\n88\n00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:12.477\napply a design theme,\n\n89\n00:04:12.477 --> 00:04:16.340\nits going to do the overall thing\nthat gonna change all of your fonts.\n\n90\n00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.190\nAll of your colors, graphics and layouts\nof the different elements that you have\n\n91\n00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.860\ncuz right now, we always had the title\nat the top and content on the bottom.\n\n92\n00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.760\nWell, in certain design themes,\nit's actually reverse and\n\n93\n00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.220\nmaybe the text is always centered or\nit's right aligned.\n\n94\n00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.200\nAnd so, let's see what it looks like.\n\n95\n00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.150\nSo, Ronnie what tab do you think we're\ngonna go to a red ribbon to find\n\n96\n00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.200\nour themes?\n\n97\n00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.226\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna assumed the slide show,\nno, not slide show, what would it be?\n\n98\n00:04:40.226 --> 00:04:41.276\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about design.\n\n99\n00:04:41.276 --> 00:04:42.522\n&gt;&gt; Design.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n100\n00:04:42.522 --> 00:04:44.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just thinking of design of-\n\n101\n00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.200\n&gt;&gt; I threw you a curveball there.\n\n102\n00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.557\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you did.\n&gt;&gt; I said themes but\n\n103\n00:04:46.557 --> 00:04:48.570\nwe were talking about design themes.\n\n104\n00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.500\nAnd then, I was like hm,\nmaybe I can see what we if-\n\n105\n00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.740\n&gt;&gt; You are tricky.\n\n106\n00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.545\nYou are tricky, yes.\n\n107\n00:04:53.545 --> 00:04:54.791\n&gt;&gt; I try to keep you on your toes.\n\n108\n00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:55.880\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you do.\n[LAUGH]\n\n109\n00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.704\n&gt;&gt; So, if we go to our design tab,\n\n110\n00:04:57.704 --> 00:05:02.703\nyou can see that we have right over here\non the left-hand side, our themes library.\n\n111\n00:05:02.703 --> 00:05:05.179\nAnd I'm gonna click this little\ndropdown to show me more.\n\n112\n00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:08.176\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; And you can see all of these different\n\n113\n00:05:08.176 --> 00:05:11.913\ntypes of thumbnails for\nour different themes.\n\n114\n00:05:11.913 --> 00:05:15.840\nNow, they are named, and\nif you don't know what their names are,\n\n115\n00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.070\nif you just hover over them, you get like\nthis is the slice and this is the wisp.\n\n116\n00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.850\nAnd this is, I think ion.\n\n117\n00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.011\nBut you can see,\nI move my mouse to quickly,\n\n118\n00:05:26.011 --> 00:05:29.410\nyou can see it's giving me that live\npreview on the slide that I have.\n\n119\n00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.861\nLike, it's changing everything.\n\n120\n00:05:30.861 --> 00:05:32.740\nLook at the colors that change.\n\n121\n00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.480\nBecause it is using that color, font,\nlayout, I think this is the one.\n\n122\n00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.004\nYeah, you can see,\nI'm actually going to go ahead and\n\n123\n00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:41.520\napply, when I said it's just one-click?\n\n124\n00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.926\nYou click it.\n\n125\n00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:44.944\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; And it goes to every single slide in\n\n126\n00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:46.031\nyour presentation.\n\n127\n00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:50.259\nSo, you could see that my theme,\nno, wait, sorry, this is a title,\n\n128\n00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.493\nthe title slide with this theme,\nhas a specific look, orientation or\n\n129\n00:05:54.493 --> 00:05:56.960\nlayout of the different elements.\n\n130\n00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.890\nI have the different colors that\nare available to me, and look at how\n\n131\n00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.600\nthe title's on the bottom because that's\nhow this particular theme is laid out.\n\n132\n00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.020\nIf I applied this one, this ion boardroom,\nyou can see that the title\n\n133\n00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.070\nis different than the content, which\nis different than the section layout.\n\n134\n00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.410\nSo, every layout has a specific look and\n\n135\n00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.300\nfeel that gives a nice continuity\nacross your entire presentation.\n\n136\n00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.280\nWe got our theme going on.\n\n137\n00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Vonne,\nI'm starting to notice this.\n\n138\n00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.392\nThat regardless of what\nthe slide layout is,\n\n139\n00:06:28.392 --> 00:06:32.556\nit is carrying through the consistent\ncolor and the font that we're seeing.\n\n140\n00:06:32.556 --> 00:06:35.850\nAs well as, having that idea,\nthe continuity that you're talking about.\n\n141\n00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.380\nWithout us having to do this for\nevery single slide.\n\n142\n00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.810\nIt really seems to be a great time\nsaver for us, if we're doing this.\n\n143\n00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.840\nBut Vonne, what is that little\nsection over there, in the middle,\n\n144\n00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.074\nthat says variance there?\n\n145\n00:06:46.074 --> 00:06:46.960\nWhat is that about?\n\n146\n00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.310\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\nYes, so maybe, I really like this theme.\n\n147\n00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:57.398\nI like the layout and where the title\nhas the graphic element behind it.\n\n148\n00:06:57.398 --> 00:07:00.120\nBut maybe, purple is just not,\nI'm not feeling purple today.\n\n149\n00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.570\nMaybe, I'm feeling more blue.\n\n150\n00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:02.760\nThat's what the variants are.\n\n151\n00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.686\nAs you can see that, it's not really\nchanging the fonts or the graphical\n\n152\n00:07:07.686 --> 00:07:13.180\nelements, it's just changing the variant\non the colors that you can use.\n\n153\n00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.030\nYou could apply an overall theme.\n\n154\n00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.122\nBut then, modify with this kinda quick\nchanges and the variance because\n\n155\n00:07:21.122 --> 00:07:25.726\nthis theme, like I said,\nit has all of this different elements.\n\n156\n00:07:25.726 --> 00:07:29.365\nWe'll just dropdown right\nover here where the more.\n\n157\n00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:32.715\nYou could say, well, I really like\neverything else but the color or\n\n158\n00:07:32.715 --> 00:07:34.435\nmaybe I don't like the fonts.\n\n159\n00:07:34.435 --> 00:07:36.725\nLove the layouts and the colors,\nI don't like the fonts.\n\n160\n00:07:36.725 --> 00:07:39.637\nMaybe, I want Times New Roman with\nthis particular design theme.\n\n161\n00:07:39.637 --> 00:07:44.200\nSo, you can come in here and you can pick\nthe different pieces whether the colors or\n\n162\n00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.265\nthe fonts.\n\n163\n00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:46.965\nThe effects and the background styles,\n\n164\n00:07:46.965 --> 00:07:49.166\nyou're not really gonna see\nmuch of that right now.\n\n165\n00:07:49.166 --> 00:07:51.225\nWell, the background,\nyou would be able to see.\n\n166\n00:07:51.225 --> 00:07:53.114\nSo, you could say,\nmaybe I want a dark background.\n\n167\n00:07:53.114 --> 00:07:54.210\nThe pick, the particular one.\n\n168\n00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.930\nSorry, I was talking about the effects.\n\n169\n00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.181\nYou might not see any of this right now,\nin the presentation that I have,\n\n170\n00:07:59.181 --> 00:07:59.938\nas our example.\n\n171\n00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:03.759\nBecause we don't have any\nmajor effects applied to it.\n\n172\n00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:06.144\nBut, it would just kind of.\n\n173\n00:08:06.144 --> 00:08:10.820\nStay with the theme, that has\na theme of effects going on there.\n\n174\n00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:16.400\nso it's kind of nice you can apply\nthe overall but then keep the pieces\n\n175\n00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.550\nof the of what a theme does for you to\nable to modify on your own and that can\n\n176\n00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.710\nbe really nice because maybe I really like\nthis cambia font instead of everything.\n\n177\n00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.720\nAnd because we used all of our regular\nlayouts, like our default layouts.\n\n178\n00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.780\nWe didn't move anything around,\nwe just kept it all kinda out of the box.\n\n179\n00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.600\nThat's where it makes it,\nhonestly, the easiest way to do it.\n\n180\n00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.956\nIf you're just ready, I need a PowerPoint\npresentation in 20 minutes because I'm\n\n181\n00:08:41.956 --> 00:08:45.959\ngoing to this presentation or this\nmeeting, and I have to present something.\n\n182\n00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:49.645\nThrow a theme on there,\ntype in your stuff, copy and paste,\n\n183\n00:08:49.645 --> 00:08:54.636\nput all the information in there, and you\ncan have a good looking presentation all\n\n184\n00:08:54.636 --> 00:08:58.780\nright from just using the basic\ndesign themes that PowerPoint has.\n\n185\n00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:03.763\n&gt;&gt; Von, I've noticed this before, and I've\nsat in some different conferences where\n\n186\n00:09:03.763 --> 00:09:08.324\nit seems like almost, I want to say\na coincidence, but it actually seems like\n\n187\n00:09:08.324 --> 00:09:12.560\npeople ended up picking the very\nsame theme over and over again.\n\n188\n00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.630\nAnd they didn't even realize\nthat they were and so\n\n189\n00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.060\nall of a sudden every single\nPowerPoint looks the same.\n\n190\n00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.360\nIt might have been on purpose but\n\n191\n00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.280\nit actually seem like it was an accident\nthat they didn't mean to do that.\n\n192\n00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.910\nSo is there something that I can do\nif I don't want to stick to let's say\n\n193\n00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.990\nthe themes that are just given there.\n\n194\n00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.040\nDo I have to do something special?\n\n195\n00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.590\nOr is there some way that I create\nmy own theme or what can happen?\n\n196\n00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:35.220\n&gt;&gt; Well, you could take like we\ncould take the pieces of themes.\n\n197\n00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.010\nBut maybe you don't even\nwant a theme at all.\n\n198\n00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.530\nYou really want something really\njust basic maybe I just want\n\n199\n00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.610\nlike a blue background and white text.\n\n200\n00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.370\nI mean, you could be as simple as that, or\n\n201\n00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.620\nmaybe you have a photograph that you\nwanna put in the back of the slides.\n\n202\n00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.900\nMaybe you've seen presentations like that.\n\n203\n00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.220\nSo, you can format the slide,\n\n204\n00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:57.400\nthe background of the slide by itself and\nthen apply it to all of your slides.\n\n205\n00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.220\nLet's go ahead and take a look at that.\n\n206\n00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.696\nWe're going take off the theme,\nbecause I've actually had people ask me,\n\n207\n00:10:02.696 --> 00:10:05.610\nI added a theme, but\nI don't know how to make it go back.\n\n208\n00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:09.580\nWell the blank,\nif you want to say, it is a theme.\n\n209\n00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.400\nIt's the office theme.\n\n210\n00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.710\nSo the office theme is just that white\nbackground, that black text, and\n\n211\n00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:19.060\nall of those colors that I\ndidn't really point out, but\n\n212\n00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.880\nwhen we were doing our font formatting\nover here, when we were selecting text,\n\n213\n00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.150\nand we were choosing our colors, you could\nsee that the colors that they gave me\n\n214\n00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.880\nin the top, they go along with the theme.\n\n215\n00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.670\nSo any time that you apply The Office\ntheme or any other theme, when you go\n\n216\n00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.470\nto change colors in either your text or\nlater when we get into shapes and\n\n217\n00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.750\neverything like that, it's going to\ngive you all of the theme colors and\n\n218\n00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:46.610\nthe different variations of the\ntransparencies, or levels at the 20, 40,\n\n219\n00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.290\n60, 80, 100 percent of the colors.\n\n220\n00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.436\nYou can see that if I hover over it,\nsee right there, lighter 80%, so\n\n221\n00:10:53.436 --> 00:10:56.960\nit gives you all of those theme colors,\nbut of course you could always go to more.\n\n222\n00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.432\nBut if you caught that, that's where\nthe theme colors come from, all right.\n\n223\n00:11:00.432 --> 00:11:04.440\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Vonne, you mentioned\nthe idea of changing this background.\n\n224\n00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.482\nLet's say that the idea of\nchanging it to a solid blue color,\n\n225\n00:11:07.482 --> 00:11:09.819\nit doesn't really sound super interesting.\n\n226\n00:11:09.819 --> 00:11:12.681\nAre there other things that we can\ndo besides applying a theme to\n\n227\n00:11:12.681 --> 00:11:13.491\nthe background?\n\n228\n00:11:13.491 --> 00:11:15.847\nCan we change it up, the background color,\n\n229\n00:11:15.847 --> 00:11:19.450\nsomehow that will actually make\nit a little bit more interesting?\n\n230\n00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.835\n&gt;&gt; We could make it very interesting.\n\n231\n00:11:22.835 --> 00:11:25.760\n[LAUGH] As in I'm not sure if anybody\nwould be interested in seeing your\n\n232\n00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.932\npresentation afterwards.\n\n233\n00:11:26.932 --> 00:11:28.544\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yes, we can do that, so\n\n234\n00:11:28.544 --> 00:11:29.750\nlet's jump into it.\n\n235\n00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.390\nSo, I've got my beginning slide,\nslide one.\n\n236\n00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.630\nI'm gonna go back over to\nthe design tab on the ribbon,\n\n237\n00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.120\nand I'm gonna come over\nto format background.\n\n238\n00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.780\nAnd, when I click on this format\nbackground, over on the right hand side,\n\n239\n00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.550\nyou're going to get your\nformat background task pane.\n\n240\n00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.370\nAnd, there's actually a couple more\noptions underneath my head, so\n\n241\n00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.960\nwhy don't we go ahead and\ntake me out of there.\n\n242\n00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.690\nPerfect.\n\n243\n00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.850\nSo you can see that I've got\nthe format background and\n\n244\n00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.090\neven before I get into the options,\nyou can see apply to all.\n\n245\n00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:56.280\nThere is an option to.\n\n246\n00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.470\nWell when I start doing something,\ndo it to all the slides or could\n\n247\n00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:04.880\nI have it just be one slide is purple,\none slide is green, one slide is blue.\n\n248\n00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.072\nAgain maybe a little too crazy.\n\n249\n00:12:07.072 --> 00:12:08.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we can do that.\n\n250\n00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.487\nSo you can see that there are different\noptions for solid colors, gradients,\n\n251\n00:12:11.487 --> 00:12:12.760\npictures, patterns.\n\n252\n00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.730\nAll right so solid I think we can all\nprobably get that idea is that when I come\n\n253\n00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:20.330\nover here and select a color, like maybe\nI want to go ahead and go to more colors.\n\n254\n00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.590\nAnd I really want to be you know, a little\nobnoxious, I'm going to go with pink.\n\n255\n00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.260\nWow, that is, that's pink.\n\n256\n00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:26.870\n&gt;&gt; Yikes.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n257\n00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.470\nyou can see that I have got a solid\ncolor applied here to this slide.\n\n258\n00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:33.040\nAnd over here on the slide tabs,\n\n259\n00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.530\nover here, you can see that it's\njust showing on that one slide.\n\n260\n00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.508\nUnless I clicked that apply to all button.\n\n261\n00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:41.780\nBut, I did wanna show you that\nyou could use your solid colors,\n\n262\n00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:45.480\nbut then you can also apply\nthe transparency levels, cuz right now,\n\n263\n00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.520\nmy transparency level is at zero.\n\n264\n00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.190\nZero means that there's, transparency\nto me is the amount of see-throughness,\n\n265\n00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.790\nI don't know if that's the technical, the\ndefinition, but that's how I describe it.\n\n266\n00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.170\nRight now there's no see-throughness,\nso you can see-\n\n267\n00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:58.042\n&gt;&gt; It's opaque.\n\n268\n00:12:58.042 --> 00:12:59.027\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right.\n\n269\n00:12:59.027 --> 00:13:01.135\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See, I know a technical term.\n\n270\n00:13:01.135 --> 00:13:03.140\n&gt;&gt; I always get those confused,\nso [LAUGH].\n\n271\n00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:07.430\nSo if I take this transparency and I pull\nit down, you can see that if I see a 40 or\n\n272\n00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:13.010\n60 or an 80, it almost makes it lighter,\nyou would think that it's lighter,\n\n273\n00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:17.430\nbecause it's actually, if you think more\nsee-through to that white slide that is by\n\n274\n00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:21.820\ndefault, so that's where you can\nkind of dim it down a little bit if\n\n275\n00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:26.458\nyou want to say, because maybe that's\na nice light pink, because that's\n\n276\n00:13:26.458 --> 00:13:30.930\nthe color of my company or what have you,\nand if I click apply to all you can\n\n277\n00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:35.720\nsee that it goes now that every single\nslide is going to have that solid fill.\n\n278\n00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.060\nBut, you could get a little fancier.\n\n279\n00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.440\nYou could go with the gradients.\n\n280\n00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.870\nI love me a gradient.\n\n281\n00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.100\nOkay so, a gradient, what does that mean?\n\n282\n00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:49.370\nYou're actually changing, kind of\nblending colors together on a gradient\n\n283\n00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:54.170\nramp as they usually call it, and\nthey have different stops along the way.\n\n284\n00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:58.330\nI call them houses but\nthey're upside down in PowerPoint but\n\n285\n00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.240\nin other programs they're actually right\nside up so they look like little houses.\n\n286\n00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.880\nSo we'll just call them\nupside down houses [LAUGH].\n\n287\n00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I can't really think of anything else.\n\n288\n00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.360\nBut you can see here once I chose\ngradient, I have some preset gradients\n\n289\n00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.960\nhere that are going to go along with\nthe color themes of this office theme.\n\n290\n00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.930\nAnd then I can say maybe\nI'll do this blue to white.\n\n291\n00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:26.110\nAnd you can see that it's got the white,\nkind of gradiating,\n\n292\n00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:28.152\nit's not a real word, but it is to me.\n\n293\n00:14:28.152 --> 00:14:31.281\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It gradiates out to the white to blue.\n\n294\n00:14:31.281 --> 00:14:33.410\nAnd you can see that there's\ndifferent types right now.\n\n295\n00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:35.860\nSo it looks like a radial, like a circle.\n\n296\n00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.150\nOr I could do a rectangular gradient.\n\n297\n00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:42.420\nOr I could do a path gradient,\nthat's kinda fancy.\n\n298\n00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.976\nOr I could do shade from the title, so\nit's taking wherever that title is, so\n\n299\n00:14:45.976 --> 00:14:48.384\nI think if your title is\npositioned somewhere else,\n\n300\n00:14:48.384 --> 00:14:51.070\nIt would actually shade\nfrom that specific area.\n\n301\n00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:54.720\nLet's just stick with our linear,\ncuz that's just a line.\n\n302\n00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.970\nSo you can see across, and then the angle,\n\n303\n00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:02.990\nyou can see that if I type this in,\nmaybe I wanna hit in 90 degrees.\n\n304\n00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.890\nYou can see that, that goes ahead and\nputs it on top and the bottom.\n\n305\n00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:10.880\nOr I do that 45, again there's that\ndiagonal, and then you could see,\n\n306\n00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.420\n180 is really 90 anyway, but\nit's just flipped in reverse, right.\n\n307\n00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.710\nSo, you could go down here, well, maybe\nI don't want to go from blue to white.\n\n308\n00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:21.410\nMaybe I want to go from blue to yellow,\nor blue to orange,\n\n309\n00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.330\nwhich does not blend very well.\n\n310\n00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:28.000\nBut, you could see that it has these\ndifferent stops right here on this\n\n311\n00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.050\ngradient ramp.\n\n312\n00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.570\nWell, if you click on one of the houses,\nand\n\n313\n00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.460\nyou can see that right here,\nI don't have my zoom on, sorry.\n\n314\n00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.060\nIt has a little orange box around it, so\n\n315\n00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.770\nthat means that you know\nwhat stop you're on.\n\n316\n00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:45.468\nAnd then I can change the color,\ncuz maybe I wanna go to orange, oof.\n\n317\n00:15:45.468 --> 00:15:48.550\nOkay, yeah,\n[LAUGH] this isn't looking so pretty but\n\n318\n00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.290\nI think you get the idea here\nis that I click on the house,\n\n319\n00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.870\nI come to the little color of\nwhat I want that stop to be.\n\n320\n00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.426\nThere we go, now we're looking good.\n\n321\n00:15:55.426 --> 00:15:56.105\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n322\n00:15:56.105 --> 00:15:59.319\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And you can start\nchanging the colors of your stops.\n\n323\n00:15:59.319 --> 00:16:05.018\nMaybe I want this right\nside house to be yellow.\n\n324\n00:16:05.018 --> 00:16:10.474\n&gt;&gt; And that's, [LAUGH] exactly, you see,\nlooks fun, but I'm not sure if you wanna\n\n325\n00:16:10.474 --> 00:16:15.871\ngo through 60 slides with this cotton\ncandy gradient looking thing going on.\n\n326\n00:16:15.871 --> 00:16:19.540\nBut at least you can do it, and you can\ndo it with some very tasteful gradients\n\n327\n00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.170\nthat like darker to lighter colors, or\nmaybe like a dark blue to a light blue.\n\n328\n00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.785\nI mean, that can look really nice,\nI'm going a little out of the box,\n\n329\n00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:30.523\na little extreme here, just to give\nyou some ideas, and maybe this white\n\n330\n00:16:30.523 --> 00:16:33.930\nhouse that's in the middle of it,\nI just don't want that there.\n\n331\n00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:38.510\nSo you could over here on the right hand\nside, you notice how I can remove that\n\n332\n00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:43.662\ngradient stop to say take that house away,\nbecause I don't want any white in there, I\n\n333\n00:16:43.662 --> 00:16:48.780\nwant all just pink and yellow well maybe,\nwhat I need a blue between there, right.\n\n334\n00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:53.910\nSo you can add a radiance stuff you see\nthat it adds a house back on that ramp and\n\n335\n00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:57.460\nthen I can go ahead and choose the color,\nand you can get pretty crazy,\n\n336\n00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.870\nwith these gradients, I always love this\nkinda rainbow thing going on here this is\n\n337\n00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:06.100\nlike my go-to gradient,\nit's always these three colors,\n\n338\n00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:11.130\nbut notice that you can take these houses,\nor why do I keep calling them houses?\n\n339\n00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:15.060\nYou can move them together are back and\nforth and so\n\n340\n00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:19.990\nthey can kind of have less room to blend\ntogether or more room to blend together\n\n341\n00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:24.530\nand you could do something as fancy\nas that, knows you could go ahead and\n\n342\n00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:29.250\nchange the position which is going\nto the position of the house.\n\n343\n00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:33.240\nI'd rather just go ahead and move them\non honestly, I see I don't even, okay,\n\n344\n00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.190\nperfect, it was back at 100 [LAUGH] and\nthen you can also change the transparency\n\n345\n00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.940\nof each one of those houses and\ngo like that.\n\n346\n00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.290\nAnd then maybe I wanna go ahead and\n\n347\n00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:45.700\napply this to all, because that, wow,\nyep, that's really pretty [LAUGH] and\n\n348\n00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:49.560\nthen that's the options for\nyour gradients again, done tastefully,\n\n349\n00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.810\nthey can be really great, but maybe what\nif this is a children's party, right?\n\n350\n00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:57.030\nMaybe this is a parrot presentation\nabout my little pony's for\n\n351\n00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:57.850\nchildren, I don't know.\n\n352\n00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:02.310\nYou could see that maybe they would\nlike that because that would be very\n\n353\n00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.230\nappealing to them, not sure in\nthe boardroom if you want to be putting\n\n354\n00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.950\non rainbow PowerPoints but\nyou know, it all depends.\n\n355\n00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:13.720\n&gt;&gt; So Von, let's say that you are as\ncreative like you are here, and\n\n356\n00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.910\nthen you realize something,\nthis is not a party for you or for me,\n\n357\n00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:19.880\neven though I might like it,\n\n358\n00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.500\nwe have to tone that down a little bit,\ncan we reset everything back very easily?\n\n359\n00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.070\n&gt;&gt; Yes, back in case we're doing\nthe formatting background and\n\n360\n00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:32.790\nwe did apply that you can notice that\nright now under behind my head the reset\n\n361\n00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:38.720\nbackground is not available to me because\nit's like you didn't anything, all right.\n\n362\n00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.890\nNow if I want to solid and you're like\nokay let's reset the background notice\n\n363\n00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.700\nthat it's not doing that again, so I\nalways stream off because you thing reset\n\n364\n00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.940\nbackground actually take\naway all the stuff you did.\n\n365\n00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.710\nReally what you will do,\nyou just go to the solid and\n\n366\n00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:57.961\nyou choose white and then you apply\nto all, that's the easiest way.\n\n367\n00:18:57.961 --> 00:19:00.790\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; To get it back to the way it was\n\n368\n00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.200\nsupposed to be, but\nnow if you had applied a theme.\n\n369\n00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.660\nLet me just throw this out for\na second, if I had taken,\n\n370\n00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.980\nI'm trying to find a theme\nthat would work, here's we go.\n\n371\n00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:17.820\nSee that design theme doesn't really work\nvery well with this particular slide,\n\n372\n00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:24.780\nbut if I had gone and changed this to a\nsolid background, because I can start with\n\n373\n00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:29.750\na theme, and then go ahead and apply this\nand say we're going to make it yellow and\n\n374\n00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:33.240\nthen go here, you can say okay,\nwell that's that's great.\n\n375\n00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.410\nYou can go ahead and\ntry to reset that, but\n\n376\n00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:41.420\nit's still going to keep on\ngoing back to whatever you had,\n\n377\n00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:45.720\nit doesn't matter whatever theme you start\nwith, you have to kind of go back to\n\n378\n00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.700\njust saying fill it in with white and\nthen it will apply.\n\n379\n00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:56.020\nYou could go back and apply whatever color\nthat you had originally had with blacks so\n\n380\n00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:01.240\nit's not as automatic as\njust reset it all, easiest\n\n381\n00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.350\nway against to not really changing in\nthe context just a product office theme,\n\n382\n00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.420\ngo back to wide and\nthen start from scratch together.\n\n383\n00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.318\nI will start from beginning and go forward\nwith wherever theme you wanna go with so\n\n384\n00:20:11.318 --> 00:20:15.098\nthat's the way I would go along with that,\nso, but to just go through a few more\n\n385\n00:20:15.098 --> 00:20:19.164\nof this options, cuz we did the solve the\ngradient, you could go back here, let me,\n\n386\n00:20:19.164 --> 00:20:23.173\nsorry, let me go back to that Office\ntheme, sorry, I'll practice what I preach,\n\n387\n00:20:23.173 --> 00:20:25.918\ngo back to the beginning,\ngo back to your Office theme.\n\n388\n00:20:25.918 --> 00:20:28.998\nWhat if I had a picture of\nthe building that I work in,\n\n389\n00:20:28.998 --> 00:20:31.950\nI want that to be\nthe background of my slide.\n\n390\n00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:37.320\nYou can choose this picture or\ntext fill, now notice texture fill,\n\n391\n00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.650\nthe textures are really odd Ronnie,\nbecause I know that you\n\n392\n00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:43.080\nused to teach PowerPoint back in the day,\ndo you remember the fish?\n\n393\n00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.058\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Remember the dead fish?\n\n394\n00:20:44.058 --> 00:20:44.984\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n395\n00:20:44.984 --> 00:20:46.905\n&gt;&gt; I never really understood\nwhy they have that.\n\n396\n00:20:46.905 --> 00:20:47.829\n&gt;&gt; It's a manly theme.\n\n397\n00:20:47.829 --> 00:20:50.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Is that what we're going with?\n\n398\n00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure why not [LAUGH].\n\n399\n00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.210\n&gt;&gt; I never really thought like fossilized\nis dead fish would be a great pattern for\n\n400\n00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.870\nthe background, but you can see that\nthe texture, these are they have been in\n\n401\n00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:04.360\nPowerPoint for years and years,\nthe bubbles and everything.\n\n402\n00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.000\nSo you could always apply that if you\nwanted to and do the same thing with\n\n403\n00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.980\nthe transparency we did before,\nbut I want to put in the picture.\n\n404\n00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:15.120\nSo you can see that we have pictures from\nour files or online so which ever way\n\n405\n00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.490\nyou want, back in our images episode we\ntalked all about those types of things.\n\n406\n00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:23.920\nSo I'm gonna go over to the images\nfolder that I have on my desktop because\n\n407\n00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.880\nmaybe I wanna go ahead and\nput in like, this is nice picture,\n\n408\n00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.310\nI like this picture, so,\nthe waterfront down in Tampa,\n\n409\n00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:36.140\nFlorida actually, sorry,\nI clicked the wrong button.\n\n410\n00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.830\nSo maybe I wanna have this\nas my slide background but\n\n411\n00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:42.830\nit's really bright if you wanna say,\nit's very pronounced.\n\n412\n00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:46.610\nSo you can go ahead and pull that\ntransparency down And they get a little\n\n413\n00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:51.520\nbit more see through and so it's just a\nlittle bit more subtle going on and again,\n\n414\n00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:57.440\nyou gonna apply to all and you can have\nthis picture applied to every slide and\n\n415\n00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.290\nthat's fine if the picture is big enough.\n\n416\n00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:04.188\nRemember back in the images episode,\nwe talked a lot about resolution,\n\n417\n00:22:04.188 --> 00:22:08.763\nthis is a high resolution or\na lot of pixels Width and height wise, so\n\n418\n00:22:08.763 --> 00:22:11.572\nit's going to be able to fill that slide,\n\n419\n00:22:11.572 --> 00:22:16.418\nif I choose a slide that is smaller,\nremember, we had bishop, right?\n\n420\n00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:16.992\nMy cat?\n\n421\n00:22:16.992 --> 00:22:19.501\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; He was, we had him as bishop small,\n\n422\n00:22:19.501 --> 00:22:23.588\nyou could see that if I use this as my\npicture, look at how blurry that is,\n\n423\n00:22:23.588 --> 00:22:27.340\nbecause it was so tiny to begin with\nthat it's trying to stretch and\n\n424\n00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.330\nfit the whole slide,\nthat's what it's doing.\n\n425\n00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.300\nYou can see down here, I do have some\nother options, maybe you have a small\n\n426\n00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.810\npicture that but you want to tile it\nyou could do that, this, actually,\n\n427\n00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:41.260\nwould be a perfect one to do it, like\nlooks at this, there's lots of bishops.\n\n428\n00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:46.130\nI can tile this picture,\nbut if I had a larger image\n\n429\n00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:50.820\nlike the Tampa waterfront,\nI could have scaled the X and\n\n430\n00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:56.090\nY down to say 25% of the original\nfile size, for it to be able to tile,\n\n431\n00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:59.670\nbut tiled pictures, I don't know,\nto me, that's a little busy, isn't it?\n\n432\n00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:00.870\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; It's yeah,\n\n433\n00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:04.130\nit's kinda go on back to this fossilized\nfish and these bubbles and everything.\n\n434\n00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.874\nIt might be a little too much, so\nwe could do that and then the last but\n\n435\n00:23:07.874 --> 00:23:11.883\nnot the least, I wanted to at least\ngo down to the options pattern fills,\n\n436\n00:23:11.883 --> 00:23:14.612\nagain, this just gotta\na little too busy for me.\n\n437\n00:23:14.612 --> 00:23:19.481\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just can't [LAUGH].\n\n438\n00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:22.955\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm just gotta go back to our solid\n\n439\n00:23:22.955 --> 00:23:28.810\nwhite background so we could go ahead and\napply, it keeps defaulting back to there\n\n440\n00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:32.800\nand then white, there we go, and apply to\nall and I'm back to the beginning of where\n\n441\n00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.950\nwe have all of these different\noptions on how to format your slides.\n\n442\n00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:40.863\nI just wanted one quick one before\nwe go into the next section,\n\n443\n00:23:40.863 --> 00:23:45.677\nyour slide size because that is something\nto at least just know where it lives\n\n444\n00:23:45.677 --> 00:23:50.869\nwithin your ribbon is if you're projecting\non a widescreen, your aspect ratio,\n\n445\n00:23:50.869 --> 00:23:55.190\nare you on a standard resolution or\nstandard monitor four by three?\n\n446\n00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.721\nI don't know, now a days I don't know how\nmany are in that four by three ratio, but\n\n447\n00:23:59.721 --> 00:24:04.517\nthis actually came up, they we're doing a\npresentation, I think it was like Freshman\n\n448\n00:24:04.517 --> 00:24:08.298\nintroductions or something at the college,\nand this was an issue.\n\n449\n00:24:08.298 --> 00:24:10.075\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n450\n00:24:10.075 --> 00:24:13.050\n&gt;&gt; And they were like, it's supposed to be\nwidescreen, it's supposed to be standard,\n\n451\n00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:14.860\nand I was like,\nit's that button right there.\n\n452\n00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:19.999\nAnd it kind of saved the day, so\nI wanted to at least point that out.\n\n453\n00:24:19.999 --> 00:24:23.150\nSo those are all of our backgrounds,\nand our themes.\n\n454\n00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:26.299\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, back to,\njust to kind of draw our memory back,\n\n455\n00:24:26.299 --> 00:24:28.440\nI don't think we'll ever forget it.\n\n456\n00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.340\nThe gradients that you did with-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n457\n00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.690\n&gt;&gt; The yellow, blue, green, whatever.\n\n458\n00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:33.475\nRed, pink.\n\n459\n00:24:33.475 --> 00:24:34.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n460\n00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.310\nlet's say that that is\nsomething that you really want.\n\n461\n00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:40.710\nBut it's not something that\nyou really want all the time,\n\n462\n00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:44.280\nis there a way that I could\nactually save that, so\n\n463\n00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.410\nthat I could use it when I do need it,\nbut, if I do, where does it show up?\n\n464\n00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:49.320\n&gt;&gt; Great question.\n\n465\n00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.300\nYes, because all of that fantastic\nformatting that I was doing.\n\n466\n00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.343\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; I wanna be able,\n\n467\n00:24:53.343 --> 00:24:57.231\nbecause once I went back to the Office it\nwas never available to me again, right?\n\n468\n00:24:57.231 --> 00:25:00.903\nAnd this could be anything that you do\nwith your back on of your slides or\n\n469\n00:25:00.903 --> 00:25:05.137\nmaybe you took a default theme and then\ndid some variations, and you really wanna\n\n470\n00:25:05.137 --> 00:25:09.086\nremember what you did, you can always,\nyou can actually see right there.\n\n471\n00:25:09.086 --> 00:25:12.310\nSee where it says save current theme,\nanything that you do and\n\n472\n00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.360\nyou're like I want to remember this,\nyou can save it.\n\n473\n00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.840\nAnd it's pretty great.\n\n474\n00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.330\nSo let's go back to that gradient.\n\n475\n00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:21.060\nLook!\nIt remembered because I was still in\n\n476\n00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.299\nthe same session if you want to\nsay of the design [INAUDIBLE]\n\n477\n00:25:24.299 --> 00:25:24.852\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n478\n00:25:24.852 --> 00:25:25.960\n&gt;&gt; I really love this and\n\n479\n00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.883\nI want to keep this.\n\n480\n00:25:26.883 --> 00:25:28.430\nI can apply it to all.\n\n481\n00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:31.920\nI don't really have to do that honestly.\n\n482\n00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:37.870\nBut if I come down here it will remember\nit for this presentation if I'm still\n\n483\n00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:42.930\ndoing it, but it didn't, but once I\nset it back it didn't remember right?\n\n484\n00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.520\nSo, if you just save\nthe current theme right there.\n\n485\n00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.300\nIf you click on that and\nI can name this rainbow.\n\n486\n00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.940\nI do want to point out that it is saving.\n\n487\n00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.390\nLook at that path there.\n\n488\n00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:55.140\nSo, this is way down in\nlike my roaming profile,\n\n489\n00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.138\nmy Microsoft templates document they've,\ndon't move it.\n\n490\n00:25:57.138 --> 00:25:57.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can.\n\n491\n00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.320\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty buried.\n\n492\n00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but why mess with it?\n\n493\n00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:04.910\nIt does have a specific reason\nbecause then it will go ahead and\n\n494\n00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:06.630\nshow up everywhere so just keep it.\n\n495\n00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:09.930\nAnd I'll name this Rainbow,\nand I'll save this.\n\n496\n00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:14.230\nAnd that way if I went back and\nclicked on this one, do you see how it is\n\n497\n00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:18.880\ngoing to be remembered in my theme\nof everything that I had done.\n\n498\n00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:23.050\nSo it's gonna keep the fonts,\nthe colors, the background.\n\n499\n00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:28.220\nAll of that would be here and just to show\nyou if I went ahead and did a file new.\n\n500\n00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.950\nI'm doing a control N.\n\n501\n00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:32.180\nKey board shortcut for file new.\n\n502\n00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:36.360\nIf I come here in my designs,\nyou can see it isn't there an option for\n\n503\n00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:42.440\nme across all of PowerPoint, it's not\njust that one specific presentation that\n\n504\n00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.950\nis going to remember all of that, I can\nsave it as a theme and use it for later.\n\n505\n00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:50.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, now Vonne earlier in our\nseries there were multiple times where we\n\n506\n00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:54.510\nsaw something pop up on the right-hand\nside that we call the designer.\n\n507\n00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:59.020\nBut you kept saying we were gonna hold off\non that until we got to a certain point,\n\n508\n00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.150\nI believe Vonne you've told me,\nthis is the point we need to get to.\n\n509\n00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:03.530\nSo Vonne, what are we talking about here?\n\n510\n00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:07.640\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we have our conclusion to our\ncliffhanger from our other episodes.\n\n511\n00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.070\nYes, design ideas.\n\n512\n00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:10.100\nI love this new thing.\n\n513\n00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.510\nIt is pretty great.\n\n514\n00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:14.420\nI'm going to go ahead and click on it.\n\n515\n00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.590\nIt did pop for me automatically\nwhen I was putting in images,\n\n516\n00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:22.870\nbecause it automatically said, here, let\nme try to help you with giving you ideas\n\n517\n00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:25.640\non how to design your slide, cool.\n\n518\n00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.710\nSo I'm gonna actually force it this time,\nthat over on the right hand side,\n\n519\n00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:30.010\nthe design ideas over here.\n\n520\n00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:34.480\nAnd remember, I'm at the new file with\na title slide, and look at all this new,\n\n521\n00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.000\nthey're like, those look neat.\n\n522\n00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.470\nThey're very modern looking,\n\n523\n00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:44.060\nthey're very kind of like what's cool\nnow if you wanna say in design trends.\n\n524\n00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.470\nSo, if I like, I really like that one.\n\n525\n00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:48.820\nSo, you could see that if I click on that.\n\n526\n00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:53.230\nI think that's fantastic, I really\nwanna go with this layout and color and\n\n527\n00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:57.090\neverything that's going on here and\nI could just go ahead and type in design\n\n528\n00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:03.240\nideas and keep on going on with\nletting PowerPoint generate how\n\n529\n00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:08.020\nit wants to help me with different\nways of designing my slides.\n\n530\n00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.420\nSo I'm gonna go ahead,\nlet's add new content and title.\n\n531\n00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.340\nAnd you can see that it's got\nsome other ones over here.\n\n532\n00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:18.330\nNow, I could mix it up, I'm not, cuz\nif you think about this one, let's see.\n\n533\n00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:22.130\nAnd that kind of matches\nwith the first one.\n\n534\n00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:24.470\nBut maybe, I mean,\nthat doesn't exactly match.\n\n535\n00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:28.730\nBut you could see that it's gonna kinda go\nback and forth with me and say, all right,\n\n536\n00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:31.540\nwell, let's just go ahead and\ntry to give you some ideas.\n\n537\n00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:35.160\nAnd it will go through and\ntell you how to move things around.\n\n538\n00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.030\nAnd this could be, I'm starting with\nnew slides that don't have any content.\n\n539\n00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:42.200\nYou could already have content applied,\nand like that basic Office layout, and\n\n540\n00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.550\nit will go back and\ngive you different ideas for that.\n\n541\n00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:50.700\nLet's do one more, just for\nfun, I'm going to go ahead and\n\n542\n00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.140\nsay cats, and\nthen I'm going to insert two pictures.\n\n543\n00:28:55.570 --> 00:29:00.000\nLet's go ahead and get Mr.\nFuego and I'm holding,\n\n544\n00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.250\nby the way, I'm selecting one,\nand if I want to get\n\n545\n00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:06.890\na multiple file that is not next to\neach other, you can hold your Ctrl key.\n\n546\n00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:08.920\nI was trying to find bishop by itself.\n\n547\n00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.240\nWell, Fuego does like to steal the show.\n\n548\n00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.750\nSo, we'll just go with a, he's kind of\ncurled up right there, how about there.\n\n549\n00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:17.090\nSo I have two pictures, so\nholding the control, and\n\n550\n00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:20.075\nI clicked on my second image to\nget two pictures at the same time,\n\n551\n00:29:20.075 --> 00:29:23.730\nsee that's gonna go ahead and\nput in these two pictures.\n\n552\n00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:24.880\nI didn't even move anything and\n\n553\n00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.260\nyou see, look at these all\nideas that it has given me.\n\n554\n00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.935\nWhich I think look really really neat.\n\n555\n00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.980\nThat one's kind of fun looking.\n\n556\n00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.530\nSo, you see it laid out my\nimages in a certain way or\n\n557\n00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.540\nmaybe it's like,\nwe kinda cut off those head over there.\n\n558\n00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:41.370\nBut you can see that it's just\ngiving you that same ideas\n\n559\n00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:44.933\nof how you might want\nto lay out your slides.\n\n560\n00:29:44.933 --> 00:29:46.976\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, may be not the biggest,\n\n561\n00:29:46.976 --> 00:29:50.408\nbest picture for Fuego, but\nthat's where I could go ahead and\n\n562\n00:29:50.408 --> 00:29:52.560\ngo into like cropping my image.\n\n563\n00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:53.780\nSo we're not going to go ahead.\n\n564\n00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.520\nSo I can move him down.\n\n565\n00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.770\nSo there we go.\n\n566\n00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.300\nMaybe make him a little smaller,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n567\n00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.780\nBut you can see these design\nideas are really really cool.\n\n568\n00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:06.970\nTo just give you, well, different ideas\non how I could design the slides, and\n\n569\n00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:10.650\nI just think they're really modern and\nhip looking, and\n\n570\n00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:15.820\nI'm very attracted to this right\nnow as a designer myself, I'm just,\n\n571\n00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:21.470\nit's not just a standard PowerPoint-y\nlooking stuff if that's even a word,\n\n572\n00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:25.900\nbut it just kind of makes it\nlook a little bit cleaner and\n\n573\n00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.334\nsmoother and pretty nice and\nI really like it.\n\n574\n00:30:28.334 --> 00:30:33.600\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne, is there any\nlimitation to using designer or\n\n575\n00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.196\nshould it actually appear every\ntime I open up PowerPoint?\n\n576\n00:30:37.196 --> 00:30:40.120\n&gt;&gt; This is a brand new feature for\noffice 2016.\n\n577\n00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:44.540\nI'm pretty sure it's 2016,\nregardless It's new.\n\n578\n00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.870\nIt's still,\nif you want to say it's almost in beta.\n\n579\n00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.380\nThey're still testing it out, and if you\nthink it's going to take a while for\n\n580\n00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:53.200\nthem maybe to kind of build it up,\nI am connected to the internet,\n\n581\n00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:58.210\nthat's one thing, or WiFi, and\nthe other thing is that you do have to be\n\n582\n00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:02.880\na subscriber to Office 365,\nthat is the biggest caveat I would say.\n\n583\n00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.520\nIs that if you have\na single product license or\n\n584\n00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.160\nthe standalone license that\nyou're not on Office 365.\n\n585\n00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.120\nAnd you're just buying\nthe Office 2016 Suite,\n\n586\n00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.200\nthis feature would not\nbe available to you.\n\n587\n00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.370\nSo that's just one of the little\nperks that they want you to be on\n\n588\n00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:18.160\nthat subscription.\n\n589\n00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:23.290\nAnd it's gonna keep updating all of\nthose design ideas, as time goes on.\n\n590\n00:31:24.438 --> 00:31:26.560\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne,\nwell there's a lot there for\n\n591\n00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.530\nus to think about, when we start\nworking more with PowerPoint,\n\n592\n00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:33.720\nespecially on formatting slides and taking\na look at applying different themes.\n\n593\n00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.590\nSo in this episode,\nVonne did shows us, well, both, right?\n\n594\n00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:40.770\nThe ability for us to be able to\ncreate our own theme if we wanted to,\n\n595\n00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:44.990\nof course also to use the preset\nthemes are actually right there, and\n\n596\n00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:50.020\neven introduced to us the new feature that\nwe tend to find inside of the designer or\n\n597\n00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.000\nthe design ideas that we have.\n\n598\n00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.640\nBut remember that that one also\nrequires an Office 365 subscription\n\n599\n00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.520\nbefore you end up seeing that.\n\n600\n00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:02.090\nSo thank you again, Vonne, for\nhelping us to be able to see the myriad of\n\n601\n00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:06.850\ndifferent ways that we can format and use\nthemes to help us make our presentation.\n\n602\n00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:09.730\nAnd thank you also for joining us as well.\n\n603\n00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:11.690\nThat's a great place for us to sign off.\n\n604\n00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:14.950\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n605\n00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:16.010\n&gt;&gt;

great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.110\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today\nyou're watching Microsoft PowerPoint 2016.\n\n8\n00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.402\nMore specifically, we're gonna be taking\na look at, well, using different shapes in\n\n9\n00:00:24.402 --> 00:00:28.237\nour PowerPoint presentation, to make us\nput the impact where we need it to go.\n\n10\n00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:30.860\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be Ms.\nVonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.240\nVonne, welcome back to the studios.\n\n12\n00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.843\n&gt;&gt; Hello, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:32.843 --> 00:00:33.900\n&gt;&gt; How are you doing today?\n\n14\n00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.790\n&gt;&gt; Good, how are you?\n\n15\n00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.330\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n16\n00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.774\nSo Vonne, what's so\nimportant about shapes?\n\n17\n00:00:37.774 --> 00:00:40.160\nWe've got so many other things\nthat we're gonna talk about.\n\n18\n00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.190\nFormatting seems to make what we need, but\n\n19\n00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.380\nwhy do we need to include shapes\ninto our Powerpoint at times?\n\n20\n00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.674\n&gt;&gt; It's always good to know how to\nkinda free form if you wanna say and\n\n21\n00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:53.281\nthen free draw,\nanything that you want on your slide.\n\n22\n00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:57.375\nCuz this is a program that you're\ngoing to be using graphics and\n\n23\n00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:01.070\nthings to be able to present\nyour different ideas.\n\n24\n00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.146\nSo being able to add like maybe\njust use a simple square or\n\n25\n00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:08.360\na circle, cuz maybe you're trying\nto demonstrate different topics.\n\n26\n00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.070\nAnd you wanna just put them in\ndifferent colored circles and\n\n27\n00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.070\nmay be different sizes.\n\n28\n00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.320\nIt kinda gives that, just that look\nof what you're trying to convey.\n\n29\n00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.896\nAnd along the line we're also going to be.\n\n30\n00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:24.730\nLearning some techniques that will\napply to other things beside shapes.\n\n31\n00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.530\nJust any element or any object that\nyou have on a PowerPoint slide.\n\n32\n00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.545\nWhether it's images, placeholders, so\nare aligning and our stacking orders,\n\n33\n00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:40.635\nit's called, is kind of an overall concept\nthat doesn't apply just to shapes.\n\n34\n00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:43.915\nIt applies to everything,\nanything that's in PowerPoint.\n\n35\n00:01:43.915 --> 00:01:47.812\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vaughn, so what just popped\ninto my head is an idea of something.\n\n36\n00:01:47.812 --> 00:01:51.956\nI know we're probably gonna have to\ndo in just a month or so from now,\n\n37\n00:01:51.956 --> 00:01:53.936\nwhich is our company field day.\n\n38\n00:01:53.936 --> 00:01:54.524\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n39\n00:01:54.524 --> 00:01:59.689\n&gt;&gt; And let's say that we use that as\na PowerPoint kind of presentation.\n\n40\n00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.058\nAnd we're gonna have four different teams\nand want a banner of a sort for each one.\n\n41\n00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:08.780\nAnd we want to create something\nlike that on our PowerPoint.\n\n42\n00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.129\nSo would using shapes help us to create\na banner regardless of what size and\n\n43\n00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.624\nshape and that way we can\nkind of identify those teams.\n\n44\n00:02:14.624 --> 00:02:18.175\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and even if a banner or\njust like maybe the party planners,\n\n45\n00:02:18.175 --> 00:02:21.997\nare going to presenting to all of us\nlike what we're going to be doing.\n\n46\n00:02:21.997 --> 00:02:24.663\nAnd maybe we have different team logos.\n\n47\n00:02:24.663 --> 00:02:26.429\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Or team colors,\n\n48\n00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:31.019\nthat would be a perfect way\nto go ahead and show that.\n\n49\n00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.637\nNow, we do have in house designers that\nwould probably wanna use something else\n\n50\n00:02:34.637 --> 00:02:36.101\nbesides PowerPoint to do that.\n\n51\n00:02:36.101 --> 00:02:38.979\nBut not everybody has Illustrator and\nPhotoshop and\n\n52\n00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:42.210\nthose different\nCreative Suite Products from Adobe.\n\n53\n00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.950\nBut PowerPoint can do some\npretty neat stuff for\n\n54\n00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.030\nyou, to where you are willing\nto create a little company logo.\n\n55\n00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.757\nMaybe you're not gonna put it\non the side of a building.\n\n56\n00:02:50.757 --> 00:02:55.183\n[LAUGH] And brand your entire company\nthat way, but you could do something for\n\n57\n00:02:55.183 --> 00:02:57.947\na party or\nan event that you are trying to do and so\n\n58\n00:02:57.947 --> 00:03:00.043\nPowerPoint can help you with that.\n\n59\n00:03:00.043 --> 00:03:03.967\n&gt;&gt; Well I think you make a very good point\nabout the idea of using PowerPoint four\n\n60\n00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:04.930\nsiemens.\n\n61\n00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.788\nEven though I'm not professional designer,\nI would still like to get it accomplished.\n\n62\n00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:12.194\nAnd I think PowerPoint has a easier\nlearning curve for someone like me,\n\n63\n00:03:12.194 --> 00:03:14.922\nthat's not experienced in\nthose different programs and\n\n64\n00:03:14.922 --> 00:03:16.533\ncan at least visually show that.\n\n65\n00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:20.686\nAnd for the idea of what we're\ntalking about here in making these,\n\n66\n00:03:20.686 --> 00:03:25.601\nit's a good time for us on the show,\nbecause then we can make fun of ourselves.\n\n67\n00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:27.191\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which is what normally actually\n\n68\n00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:27.990\nworks better for us.\n\n69\n00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.099\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, exactly.\n\n70\n00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.685\nAnd I have had a lot of people\nsince they only have office,\n\n71\n00:03:33.685 --> 00:03:37.260\nthey don't have all of\nthe rest of the AW products.\n\n72\n00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.178\nThis is the most graphical manipulation\nproduct that you have within\n\n73\n00:03:42.178 --> 00:03:43.543\nthe Office suite.\n\n74\n00:03:43.543 --> 00:03:46.877\nSo yes, you can use it in that capacity.\n\n75\n00:03:46.877 --> 00:03:48.510\nSo why don't we go ahead and get started.\n\n76\n00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.110\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n\n77\n00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.180\n&gt;&gt; And start drawing some shapes because\nI have a file called, drawshapes.\n\n78\n00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.480\n[LAUGH] So we've got our Drawshapes and\nit starts with just two blank slides.\n\n79\n00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.020\nSo the reason, it's just like our canvas.\n\n80\n00:04:02.092 --> 00:04:04.400\nSo is what we're gonna be using\nto create our different shades.\n\n81\n00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.414\nBut along the way, I just wanna point\nout that I do have three other slides,\n\n82\n00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:12.493\nthat are going t, this kind of summarize\nall the different things I'm gonna\n\n83\n00:04:12.493 --> 00:04:14.300\nbe showing you guys, all right?\n\n84\n00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.030\nSo let's go back to our blank slide.\n\n85\n00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.110\nSo how am I going to insert a shape?\n\n86\n00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.440\nWhat do you think Ronnie,\nwhere am I gonna go?\n\n87\n00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.535\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna assume insert.\n\n88\n00:04:22.535 --> 00:04:23.051\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n89\n00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:24.510\n&gt;&gt; Is what I'm gonna assume.\n\n90\n00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.418\n&gt;&gt; I didn't give you any\ncurve ball on that one did I.\n\n91\n00:04:25.418 --> 00:04:27.983\n&gt;&gt; No, no you did not, that was easier.\n\n92\n00:04:27.983 --> 00:04:31.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right so I have insert,\nand I'm gonna go with shapes.\n\n93\n00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.486\nAnd I drop this down you can\nsee there's all sorts of\n\n94\n00:04:36.486 --> 00:04:39.458\ndifferent shapes that I can use.\n\n95\n00:04:39.458 --> 00:04:43.795\nI wanna start using the terminology when I\nstart teaching in Illustrator, like paths,\n\n96\n00:04:43.795 --> 00:04:45.920\nwe talk about closed paths and open paths.\n\n97\n00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.109\nWe'll just stay with shapes.\n\n98\n00:04:47.109 --> 00:04:51.333\nBut you have rectangles which would be\nlike closed versus a line which would\n\n99\n00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:52.820\nbe open.\n\n100\n00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.630\nSo you have these different ones in here,\nwe have our different blocks.\n\n101\n00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.343\nBasically you pick, it’s kind of like\npicking a crayon out of a crayon box,\n\n102\n00:05:00.343 --> 00:05:00.932\nall right?\n\n103\n00:05:00.932 --> 00:05:02.650\nI want to grab it and\nI want to draw with it.\n\n104\n00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.954\nSo, I'm gonna start with well let’s go,\nlet’s just go basic and\n\n105\n00:05:05.954 --> 00:05:06.957\ngo with the circle.\n\n106\n00:05:06.957 --> 00:05:09.148\nAnd usually when you click on people\nwill like, well what just happened?\n\n107\n00:05:09.148 --> 00:05:12.043\nIt's like you picked up the pencil\nin your hand, how you gotta draw it.\n\n108\n00:05:12.043 --> 00:05:13.541\nThere is two ways that you can do this.\n\n109\n00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:18.947\nYou can click once,\njust click and it goes ahead and\n\n110\n00:05:18.947 --> 00:05:24.499\ninserts that shape in\nthe default size that it is in.\n\n111\n00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:27.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nI just single-click and it adds it.\n\n112\n00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.240\nNow, the other way that you could do it,\nI'm gonna go back to Insert and\n\n113\n00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.090\nback to Shapes, and\n\n114\n00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.210\nI'm gonna click the circle, right,\npicking the shape that I want to add.\n\n115\n00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.666\nThe other way is that you can click,\nhold and\n\n116\n00:05:37.666 --> 00:05:42.712\ndrag to draw the circle or\nthe shape onto your slide before I start\n\n117\n00:05:42.712 --> 00:05:47.869\nthere are something else that you\ncan do while you're dragging.\n\n118\n00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:52.490\nIt's holding the shift key to\nconstrain the proportions.\n\n119\n00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.810\nWhat that means is you don't want\nan oval you want a perfect circle,\n\n120\n00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.068\nthat's where you hold your shift key.\n\n121\n00:05:59.068 --> 00:06:01.684\nSo I'm gonna click, hold, and\ndrag I'm not holding the shift right now.\n\n122\n00:06:01.684 --> 00:06:06.681\nJust to show you that I can kind of\nmake it whatever size if you wanna say\n\n123\n00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:11.777\nsquash or not squash, [LAUGH] but\nseriously I hold that shift key down.\n\n124\n00:06:11.777 --> 00:06:16.715\nNow, I'm dragging you see how always\nconstrained portions to keep it\n\n125\n00:06:16.715 --> 00:06:20.900\nin that perfect circle\nwhatever the default.\n\n126\n00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.655\nAspect ratio is of that shape.\n\n127\n00:06:23.655 --> 00:06:28.077\nSo, let go of your mouse first by the way\nand then your shift key because that way\n\n128\n00:06:28.077 --> 00:06:31.829\nif you let go of the shift key\nsometimes right before it will come and\n\n129\n00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:34.049\ngo back to where it was squashed again.\n\n130\n00:06:34.049 --> 00:06:35.705\nSquashed, technical terms again.\n\n131\n00:06:35.705 --> 00:06:36.585\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n132\n00:06:36.585 --> 00:06:38.750\nI actually did something really quick.\n\n133\n00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.056\nI moved that circle.\n\n134\n00:06:40.056 --> 00:06:42.440\nIt's just by habit.\n\n135\n00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.640\nBut that goes back to what is your mouse,\ncursor arrow look like?\n\n136\n00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.340\nIf you have four pointed arrow\nover something that means move.\n\n137\n00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.140\nIf you have other arrows, like a two\npoint arrow or the swirly arrow,\n\n138\n00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.060\nthen you're gonna be doing\nsomething different.\n\n139\n00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.640\nSo see if I hover over the smaller circle,\nit is four pointed arrow, so\n\n140\n00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.400\nI can just click, hold and drag and\nI can start moving it around.\n\n141\n00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.530\nI can move this around and I'm sure you're\nprobably like what are all those little\n\n142\n00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.110\nthings that keep popping up, right?\n\n143\n00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.327\nThose little red lines,\nthose are this new feature or\n\n144\n00:07:12.327 --> 00:07:16.740\nnewer feature in PowerPoint\nas your auto align guides.\n\n145\n00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.371\nWhich is fantastic to me because this\nis something actually in a lot of your\n\n146\n00:07:21.371 --> 00:07:22.503\nAdobe products.\n\n147\n00:07:22.503 --> 00:07:26.517\nCuz if I'm moving it around, you can\nsee it's starting to automatically,\n\n148\n00:07:26.517 --> 00:07:28.033\nlike if I move it down there.\n\n149\n00:07:28.033 --> 00:07:30.578\nThe bottom of this bigger circle,\n\n150\n00:07:30.578 --> 00:07:35.000\nis aligning with the very\ntop of this smaller circle.\n\n151\n00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.280\nAnd if I move it now there I see\nthe centers of those circles are aligning,\n\n152\n00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.800\nwhich is super handy if\nyou're trying to like me,\n\n153\n00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.780\nmake sure everything is right and aligned\nand perfectly matched and everything.\n\n154\n00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.401\nSo for somebody like me, love this stuff.\n\n155\n00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:52.481\nI just wanted to point that out\nto you before we get any further\n\n156\n00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:57.122\ncuz if you're like me, what wait it that,\nwait tell me what that is.\n\n157\n00:07:57.122 --> 00:08:01.289\n[LAUGH] So if I go to my two pointed\narrows, That is on any corner or\n\n158\n00:08:01.289 --> 00:08:05.320\nany side of that element,\nthat’s where we can resize this.\n\n159\n00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.488\nSo if I wanted to make this, now this\ngoes back to that shift key again,\n\n160\n00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.419\nif I don't hold the shift key I can\nkind of move it however I want.\n\n161\n00:08:11.419 --> 00:08:17.020\nI'm gonna let go and I'm gonna do my\nhand undo, control Z, right there.\n\n162\n00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.372\nHold that shift key while you size,\nit will maintain those proportions of\n\n163\n00:08:21.372 --> 00:08:24.894\nwhat you have of that element as well so\nyou can resize this.\n\n164\n00:08:24.894 --> 00:08:28.230\nNow this is a circle, so it's not\ngonna make much of a different but\n\n165\n00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.150\nif we rotate it, it's gonna rotate.\n\n166\n00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.840\nWell, yeah, okay,\nhow about I make it more like an oval?\n\n167\n00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.548\nThere we go, that will demonstrate\nthat if I can go ahead and\n\n168\n00:08:36.548 --> 00:08:41.161\nrotate by having my cursor over that\nswirl thing at the top I get the swirl.\n\n169\n00:08:41.161 --> 00:08:43.429\nAgain, more technical terms from me.\n\n170\n00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:48.410\n[LAUGH] And you can go ahead and\nrotate those different shapes.\n\n171\n00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:53.210\nSo resizing moving, rotating,\nthose are all the different things\n\n172\n00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:58.810\nright away that you can start doing\nto these shapes that you have.\n\n173\n00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:03.950\nNotice that you do have the format tab,\nthat's your contextual tab,\n\n174\n00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:08.130\ncome up on the ribbon for you to be\nable to format this particular shape.\n\n175\n00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.100\nSo you can see right over here,\nshape fill.\n\n176\n00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.337\nMaybe I want to change the color of\nthis circle, I wanna make it yellow.\n\n177\n00:09:14.337 --> 00:09:18.974\nThe outline, or\nin other programs it's called stroke,\n\n178\n00:09:18.974 --> 00:09:24.200\nthe outline of that shape right\nunderneath it, shape outline.\n\n179\n00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.363\nMaybe I wanna make this a green outline,\nI'm just picking colors.\n\n180\n00:09:29.363 --> 00:09:32.870\nBut maybe I want that stroke\nto be a little thicker.\n\n181\n00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:36.881\nClick back on stroke, sorry,\n[LAUGH] shape outline,\n\n182\n00:09:36.881 --> 00:09:40.187\nyou see you have the weight\nof that outline.\n\n183\n00:09:40.187 --> 00:09:44.500\nI really wanna say stroke [LAUGH]\ndefaulting back into my Adobe training.\n\n184\n00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.612\nSo if I make that thicker\nyou can go ahead and\n\n185\n00:09:46.612 --> 00:09:49.440\nsee that the weight is just\na little bit more pronounced.\n\n186\n00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.990\nAnd you probably noticed that you can also\ngo into like the dashed versions of this,\n\n187\n00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.170\nmaybe we'll, well that looks cute.\n\n188\n00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:00.450\nSo we can go in there and\nmake the outline dashed in there,\n\n189\n00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.520\nand you can just keep on keeping on.\n\n190\n00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.747\nWe've done some of these\nformats with our images.\n\n191\n00:10:05.747 --> 00:10:08.975\nIt's the same idea,\nyou just start clicking on this stuff,\n\n192\n00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:12.215\nyou start applying it, and\nyou can make it look at every one.\n\n193\n00:10:12.215 --> 00:10:19.433\nYou do have a few presets in here that\nalso correlate with some of the effects,\n\n194\n00:10:19.433 --> 00:10:24.000\nbecause a style is just\na collection of formats.\n\n195\n00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.594\nSo it had the fill, the outline,\nthe transparency, the effects,\n\n196\n00:10:29.594 --> 00:10:34.320\nand that's all that are kind\nof in these default styles.\n\n197\n00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.502\nBut they really apply all\nthe different things that are on\n\n198\n00:10:37.502 --> 00:10:39.894\nthe right-hand side as the fill outline.\n\n199\n00:10:39.894 --> 00:10:44.511\nAnd then you have your shape effects,\njust like our images where you\n\n200\n00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:49.570\ncan have shadows and glows and\nall sorts of fun things like that.\n\n201\n00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.599\n&gt;&gt; Now Vaughn,\nI know I've done this before.\n\n202\n00:10:51.599 --> 00:10:54.951\nBut I've also seen where\nI've had shapes disappear.\n\n203\n00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:59.495\nBecause what I did is I created\na large object and a small object, and\n\n204\n00:10:59.495 --> 00:11:03.416\nI ended up moving a large object\non top of a smaller object.\n\n205\n00:11:03.416 --> 00:11:06.348\nAnd I forgot about it, as I moved on,\nbecause I just forgot about it.\n\n206\n00:11:06.348 --> 00:11:09.510\nIs there anything I can do to help me\nout to make sure that those are not\n\n207\n00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.240\ngonna do that?\n\n208\n00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.954\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that actually happens a lot,\n\n209\n00:11:12.954 --> 00:11:18.000\nbecause it all depends on the order\nin which you add elements.\n\n210\n00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.162\nThat becomes that stacking order\nthat I had mentioned before.\n\n211\n00:11:22.162 --> 00:11:25.650\nSo I can actually do this right here,\nI'm gonna take this blue circle and\n\n212\n00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:26.746\nI'm gonna move.\n\n213\n00:11:26.746 --> 00:11:32.010\nI thought it was gonna go on top of it,\nbecause I guess I drew this one first.\n\n214\n00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.090\nAnd then the yellow one\nwas the one I drew second.\n\n215\n00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.490\nSo you can see that the yellow\nis on top of the blue.\n\n216\n00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.685\nAnd I know that because I'm,\nwell, I'm moving him around.\n\n217\n00:11:40.685 --> 00:11:43.037\nAnd yes,\nlike that is that what you've done?\n\n218\n00:11:43.037 --> 00:11:43.539\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n219\n00:11:43.539 --> 00:11:45.412\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and so it’s like,\nwhere did my other circle go?\n\n220\n00:11:45.412 --> 00:11:47.629\nSo there's actually a new thing\ncalled the selection pane,\n\n221\n00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:48.767\nwhich I'll get to in a second.\n\n222\n00:11:48.767 --> 00:11:50.535\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be really, really handy.\n\n223\n00:11:50.535 --> 00:11:53.707\nIt kinda gives you that\nbirds eye view of everything\n\n224\n00:11:53.707 --> 00:11:55.782\nthat you might not be able to see.\n\n225\n00:11:55.782 --> 00:11:59.338\nAll right, so stacking order is good to\nknow what it does and what it means and\n\n226\n00:11:59.338 --> 00:12:00.739\nthen what about how to fix it?\n\n227\n00:12:00.739 --> 00:12:06.875\nSo what don't I do one more thing,\nI'm going to add another shape.\n\n228\n00:12:06.875 --> 00:12:09.324\nLet's go ahead I'll just\ngonna add a rectangle, okay?\n\n229\n00:12:09.324 --> 00:12:14.696\nAnd I just single-clicked to add that,\nand I'll go ahead and\n\n230\n00:12:14.696 --> 00:12:19.151\nsay let's make this,\nwell let's make it orange.\n\n231\n00:12:19.151 --> 00:12:20.359\nWell, that's good enough.\n\n232\n00:12:20.359 --> 00:12:21.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll just go on right now, and\n\n233\n00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.800\nmake it a little bit bigger.\n\n234\n00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.510\nSo you can see that right now that\nthe orange square is going to go on\n\n235\n00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.710\ntop of both of those circles\nbecause it was drawn last, okay?\n\n236\n00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.780\nBut what if I wanted to put that\n\n237\n00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:40.230\nsquare behind the yellow circle,\nbut not behind the blue circle?\n\n238\n00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.210\nThis is where you get bring to front,\nsent to back, or\n\n239\n00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.961\nbring forward, or send backwards.\n\n240\n00:12:46.961 --> 00:12:49.942\nSend backwards, it's like there's\nthree pieces of paper and\n\n241\n00:12:49.942 --> 00:12:52.820\nyou want to reshuffle them,\nthat's what's going on here.\n\n242\n00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:57.567\nSo with the element that I want to\naffect selected, my orange square.\n\n243\n00:12:57.567 --> 00:13:01.887\nYou can see that over here on our\narrange section of our format tab,\n\n244\n00:13:01.887 --> 00:13:04.835\nI can go ahead and\nsend this back or backward.\n\n245\n00:13:04.835 --> 00:13:08.060\nBackward is one step.\n\n246\n00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.847\nTo the back,\nmeans all the way to the back.\n\n247\n00:13:11.847 --> 00:13:16.959\nLet's go with send it backward, and\nyou can see that now that orange square\n\n248\n00:13:16.959 --> 00:13:22.160\ngoes behind the yellow circle, but\nin front of the blue circle, okay.\n\n249\n00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.660\nIf I wanted to send it all the way behind,\n\n250\n00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.900\nthen you can see I could\ngo all the way to the back.\n\n251\n00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.080\nRight now I'll send backward and\n\n252\n00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.760\ndo the same thing cuz I only have three\nsteps but all the way to the back.\n\n253\n00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.020\nAnd so on and so forth or\nmaybe I wanted it now take this\n\n254\n00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.150\nitem that's all the way in the back and\nbring it to the front.\n\n255\n00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:44.640\nSo select it, bring to front and\nnow you can see that this is in the front.\n\n256\n00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.210\nWhat if I wanted to take this blue one and\nput that in front?\n\n257\n00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:52.810\nSo I'll go ahead and bring that to\nfront and maybe I can take that.\n\n258\n00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.479\nThere we go, there's our Field Day logo.\n\n259\n00:13:55.479 --> 00:13:59.417\n[LAUGH] I'm not sure if\nit really means much, but\n\n260\n00:13:59.417 --> 00:14:03.360\nit's shapes and\nthey're on top of each other.\n\n261\n00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.390\nAnd notice that I used those default,\noops, let me undo that.\n\n262\n00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:11.957\nI was using those default alignments\nto where I can make sure that, okay,\n\n263\n00:14:11.957 --> 00:14:16.000\nyeah, is this square\nperfectly aligned within,\n\n264\n00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.830\nsometimes the auto-aligns\nget a little weird.\n\n265\n00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:20.480\nThere we go,\nthat's what I was looking for.\n\n266\n00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:25.940\nTo where the square is right in\nthe center of that yellow circle.\n\n267\n00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.080\nAnd I can do the same thing here.\n\n268\n00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.550\nIs where if I just move it around,\nand sometimes, there we go.\n\n269\n00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:35.270\nThey kind of snap, you can kind of\nalmost feel it like catching each other.\n\n270\n00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:39.410\nAnd that way you know that\neverything is perfectly aligned\n\n271\n00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:43.590\nright center center of these\nthree overlapping shapes.\n\n272\n00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.470\nAnd I just love those Guides.\n\n273\n00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:51.270\nBut what if I didn't have\nthose guides to begin with?\n\n274\n00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:54.820\nSo I'm gonna move this off to the side and\noff to that side.\n\n275\n00:14:54.820 --> 00:15:02.550\nI can go ahead and use our align commands\nto go ahead and align these options.\n\n276\n00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.080\nNow the thing is,\nyou have to make sure that you have\n\n277\n00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.970\neverything that you need\nto have aligned selected.\n\n278\n00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.311\nBecause if I just click on this shape,\nthis one shape,\n\n279\n00:15:11.311 --> 00:15:14.009\nand choose it to align left or\nalign center.\n\n280\n00:15:14.009 --> 00:15:15.620\nThat's the little button\nthat I clicked on.\n\n281\n00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.678\nOr, the align top,\n\n282\n00:15:16.678 --> 00:15:20.720\nyou could see that I go to align left\nit's gonna align left with what?\n\n283\n00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:26.770\nThe slide cuz didn't have anything else\nselected for it to say align all the lefts\n\n284\n00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:31.440\nof these particular objects or align\nall the rights or align all the tops.\n\n285\n00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.000\nSo you can see that I do like all\nthe little graphical icons so\n\n286\n00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.330\nit gives you an idea of what that means.\n\n287\n00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:43.330\nSo if I'm going to align all of\nthese pieces to their lefts,\n\n288\n00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.120\nI gotta make sure I select multiples.\n\n289\n00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.700\nNow how do I select multiple items?\n\n290\n00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.300\nYou can use your shift key.\n\n291\n00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.356\nYour shift key will always\nselect multiple items.\n\n292\n00:15:52.356 --> 00:15:56.994\nSo I single-clicked on that is orange,\norange square, pulled my shift key,\n\n293\n00:15:56.994 --> 00:16:01.370\nsingle-click on the blue circle,\nsingle-click on the yellow circle.\n\n294\n00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:05.115\nAnd you can see That I know I have those\nelements selected because the dots,\n\n295\n00:16:05.115 --> 00:16:08.340\nthat's how I always know that I know,\nand the little swirlies.\n\n296\n00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.163\nDid you see multiple swirlies?\n\n297\n00:16:09.163 --> 00:16:12.270\nYou know you have multiple items selected.\n\n298\n00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:15.660\nSo with these items selected,\nif I come over here to my align,\n\n299\n00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:20.300\nyou can see that I have align left,\ncenter right, if I align them to the left.\n\n300\n00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.170\nNow, it is automatically\naligning with the slide.\n\n301\n00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.224\nI realize that.\n\n302\n00:16:24.224 --> 00:16:25.725\nWait, I know why.\n\n303\n00:16:25.725 --> 00:16:33.370\n[LAUGH] the reason why I was doing that is\nbecause, what was the leftest most object?\n\n304\n00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:33.930\n&gt;&gt; Square.\n\n305\n00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:35.300\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.\n\n306\n00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.900\nI'm not sure if that was the correct\nvocabulary but, to me in my mind,\n\n307\n00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:39.980\nthat's how it went.\n\n308\n00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:43.830\nSo if I had put this over here,\nall right and\n\n309\n00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:48.040\nI shift click to select those three\nitems and then align the left,\n\n310\n00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:53.230\nyou see it's gonna take the furthest left\nedge and go ahead and align to that.\n\n311\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:57.570\nAnd the same thing we'll go whether you\nhave a, if had this in align them to\n\n312\n00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:02.300\nthe top, so I'll align all the tops, so\nyou could see that the toppest [LAUGH],\n\n313\n00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.870\nthe toppest element is\nwhere it's going to go for.\n\n314\n00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:09.120\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\ngo back to say align the centers, and\n\n315\n00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.300\nthen align the other centers, or the\nmiddles, center, center is what I call it.\n\n316\n00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.290\nAnd so I'm back to my field day logo.\n\n317\n00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:19.246\nCuz, I could always add some\ntext on the bottom of that.\n\n318\n00:17:19.246 --> 00:17:20.954\nYou know what, just for fun why not.\n\n319\n00:17:20.954 --> 00:17:28.117\nWe'll go to insert, we'll go to text box,\nwe'll click hold and\n\n320\n00:17:28.117 --> 00:17:32.960\ndrag, and we'll say ITPro.TV Field Day.\n\n321\n00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.460\nFired day?\n\n322\n00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.205\nNo that would be bad.\n\n323\n00:17:34.205 --> 00:17:36.440\n[LAUGH] Field Day.\n\n324\n00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.030\nAnd then I can take something like this,\n\n325\n00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.150\nlet's do just a quick format\nof making that centered.\n\n326\n00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:46.060\nMaking that bold, maybe make it a little\nbit bigger, and then there you go.\n\n327\n00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.810\nNow I would still wanna make\nsure that that's a line,\n\n328\n00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:50.800\ncuz it's a little off right now,\nit's really bothering me.\n\n329\n00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.190\nSo another way that you can\nselect multiple elements,\n\n330\n00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.630\nis you can use the click,\nhold, and drag method.\n\n331\n00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:00.810\nThe only caveat to this one is you've\ngotta make sure you completely surround\n\n332\n00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:01.810\nall the elements.\n\n333\n00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:05.450\nIn some of the other products, at least in\nthe Adobe products, as long as you're just\n\n334\n00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:09.430\nlike touching the parts of it,\nit will go ahead and select all of it.\n\n335\n00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.340\nSo for example let me show you,\nI'm out of this blank here and\n\n336\n00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:16.645\nI have the white arrows, so\nnothing else is able for me to select.\n\n337\n00:18:16.645 --> 00:18:19.570\n[LAUGH] So if I click,\nhold and drag, you see how?\n\n338\n00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:23.090\nI'm actually over all the elements,\nthat I would want to grab, but\n\n339\n00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:27.370\nif I let go It doesn't see it, and that's\nwhat I mean by as long as you kinda,\n\n340\n00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.830\njust touch it, you'll be able to grab it.\n\n341\n00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.320\nBut in this sense, you gotta go\nall the way across, and click.\n\n342\n00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.310\nI go all the way,\nfully encompass everything, and\n\n343\n00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:37.730\nyou see how it is selecting.\n\n344\n00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:40.030\nActually, it didn't select that circle,\ndid it?\n\n345\n00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.940\nThat's okay, it got most of it, okay,\n\n346\n00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.480\nbecause I could always then come back,\nhold that Shift key.\n\n347\n00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.170\nAnd select that final option or\nthat final object.\n\n348\n00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.270\nSo you can use a combination,\ncuz it didn't grab everything but,\n\n349\n00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.250\nI know that I can go back and\ngo to that Shift key and select it.\n\n350\n00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:57.130\nSo I have all of these things selected.\n\n351\n00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:01.630\nI want this to be able to go wherever\nI need to go on multiple slides.\n\n352\n00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.630\nMaybe I'll take this and\nI'll print this out, and\n\n353\n00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:09.070\nput it on the refrigerator in\nthe break room or something.\n\n354\n00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:15.480\nSo I can over to group this because,\nI want these things to all move together.\n\n355\n00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:20.380\nSo if I go to Format,\nI can go to right here, Group And\n\n356\n00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.040\nyou can see that it gives\nyou the options to proof.\n\n357\n00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.300\nIf it is grayed out, you don't have\nmultiple items selected, okay.\n\n358\n00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.490\nNow I'm doing everything\nthrough the ribbon right now.\n\n359\n00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:31.600\nI'm going up to the ribbon to group,\nI'm going up to the ribbon to align.\n\n360\n00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:35.480\nI did wanna show you that\nRight clicking does a lot,\n\n361\n00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.980\nof these things that I'm showing you.\n\n362\n00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.860\nThe whole Bring to front,\nSend to back, Group.\n\n363\n00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.430\nAll of those things are there.\n\n364\n00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:46.050\nSo I just wanted to go back to the\nright-click, and I'm gonna say Group and\n\n365\n00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:51.070\nyou can see that now,\nall of these items are grouped together as\n\n366\n00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.660\none entity that now I can take and\nmove around.\n\n367\n00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.420\nI can hold my Shift key and\nmake this smaller.\n\n368\n00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.940\nI forgot that the text is\nkind of resizing itself.\n\n369\n00:20:01.078 --> 00:20:05.260\nBut, at least we got the idea for\nright now of how we can go ahead and\n\n370\n00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:09.920\ngroup these items together and\nnow we've got a cute little logo.\n\n371\n00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.020\n&gt;&gt; Now, Yvonne, what if we realize\nsomething that even though this logo\n\n372\n00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:17.850\nis a good start for us, what if we\nwanted to change one of those elements.\n\n373\n00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.410\nLet's take for example the larger\nsquare we wanted to change that color,\n\n374\n00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.990\nthey're all grouped together, how do we\nget to the autochange that one element?\n\n375\n00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:29.016\n&gt;&gt; One of the ways you could do it is if\nyou can group something you can ungroup\n\n376\n00:20:29.016 --> 00:20:31.850\nit, okay, so I can say cuz,\nI know, I know.\n\n377\n00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:33.590\nThat I group this, okay.\n\n378\n00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:38.160\nSo if I right click on the selected item,\nI can go to group and I can go to\n\n379\n00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:42.610\nungroup and then you can see that I\nget all my little dots back together.\n\n380\n00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.960\nClick off of this first because if I\nwent and change the color right now,\n\n381\n00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.480\nyou see it's changing everything.\n\n382\n00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.911\nCommon problem or common thing that\na lot of people do, I do it too.\n\n383\n00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:56.444\nI'm like, ops, gotta Deselect first,\nthen I'll go ahead and\n\n384\n00:20:56.444 --> 00:20:58.720\nthat's the, that is the circle.\n\n385\n00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.487\nThis, I think I know where\nyou're going Ronnie.\n\n386\n00:21:01.487 --> 00:21:06.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So right here if I got,\nI went ahead and grabbed this square and I\n\n387\n00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.590\n&gt;&gt; And I wanted to make it red, right so\n\n388\n00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:11.220\nthat's one way that I can go ahead and\ndo that.\n\n389\n00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.100\nBut you can see that selecting\nthat particular square,\n\n390\n00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.440\nit was kind of hard wasn't it?\n\n391\n00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.000\nBecause, the circle is almost\ncovering the whole thing.\n\n392\n00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.080\nSo this is a great place to\nintroduce the selection pane, okay.\n\n393\n00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.950\nSo I'm gonna go back over to,\n\n394\n00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:29.720\nmy I'm just gonna select one shakes that's\nthe easiest way for me to get to it.\n\n395\n00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.880\nSo if I go into the format tab, and\n\n396\n00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.360\nI go to selection pane you can see\nthat over here on the right hand side,\n\n397\n00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:42.670\nit's going to show me the different\nthings if you wanna say on my slide.\n\n398\n00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.360\nSo you can see it's got an oval,\nand a rectangle, and a text box.\n\n399\n00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.290\nSo that's giving me some of the names\nof the shapes, and then that way I\n\n400\n00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:55.190\ncould go ahead and actually click on them,\nand select those pieces.\n\n401\n00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:58.620\nSo if I wanted to get that rectangle,\n\n402\n00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.460\nI could have come over here to the\nselection pane and clicked it from here.\n\n403\n00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:07.770\nAnd then went ahead and changed the color\nof the shape to purple or what have you.\n\n404\n00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:11.430\nAnd that's really a nice way for\nme to be able to see or\n\n405\n00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:15.968\nselect using this task pane to see the\ndifferent pieces which was really handy.\n\n406\n00:22:15.968 --> 00:22:17.033\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n407\n00:22:17.033 --> 00:22:21.890\nYvonne, what is the little tiny thing over\non the right hand side of rectangle one.\n\n408\n00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:23.320\nWhat is that?\n\n409\n00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.198\nThose are eyeballs.\n\n410\n00:22:24.198 --> 00:22:27.560\n&gt;&gt; Eyeballs. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\nI know that they're eyeballs,\n\n411\n00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.610\ncuz that's what I call them.\n\n412\n00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:30.090\nOkay, they're visibility.\n\n413\n00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:34.060\nOkay, you can click those little eyeballs,\npoke out the eyeball, as I call it.\n\n414\n00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:36.780\nWhen you poke the eyeball\nout it closes your eye, and\n\n415\n00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:41.070\nthen it's actually turning off\nthe visibility of that element.\n\n416\n00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.860\nSo if you have a really complex shape,\n\n417\n00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.680\nsometimes it's like I don't even\nknow what these pieces are.\n\n418\n00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.520\nWhat I do is I turn the eyeballs off and\non.\n\n419\n00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.410\nOkay, what is that, that's the circle.\n\n420\n00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:52.340\nOkay, that's the text.\n\n421\n00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:57.620\nAnd I can kind of use that to isolate and\ntry to figure out\n\n422\n00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:01.950\nexactly what I'm doing\nwithin these elements.\n\n423\n00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:06.030\nAnother thing that I wanted to show\nreally quickly, let me go ahead and\n\n424\n00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.700\ninsert another shape for right now.\n\n425\n00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.680\nLet's go ahead and grab this,\nwe'll grab the sun.\n\n426\n00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.360\nOkay.\n\n427\n00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.320\nSo there's the sun.\n\n428\n00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.930\nIf I had come back to these guys over here\n\n429\n00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.740\nright remember where gotta\nuse my Shift key again.\n\n430\n00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:23.280\nAnd I could have use the, here,\nlet me click off of here.\n\n431\n00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.130\nI could have used my Shift key over here.\n\n432\n00:23:27.701 --> 00:23:29.702\nI lie, no, you can't use an attachment.\n\n433\n00:23:29.702 --> 00:23:30.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so you know what?\n\n434\n00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:31.890\nYou can't do that.\n\n435\n00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:36.110\nCrossing my paths again of illustrator and\nPowerPoint.\n\n436\n00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:39.670\nSo why don't I go back to the other way of\njust going ahead and dragging across and\n\n437\n00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:40.780\nthen using the Shift key here.\n\n438\n00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:42.000\nOkay, good, see?\n\n439\n00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.980\nLearning experience for all of us [LAUGH].\n\n440\n00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:48.350\nIf I did this and I grouped it, right,\nwe will had this graph back as a group.\n\n441\n00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:53.200\nNotice in the selection pane, I could've\nactually seen that this was a group.\n\n442\n00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.201\nIf I, maybe I had given this to you, and\n\n443\n00:23:55.201 --> 00:23:57.550\nyou didn't even know\nthat that was a group.\n\n444\n00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:02.296\nIn the selection pane, you could be\nable to see that this is a group.\n\n445\n00:24:02.296 --> 00:24:06.920\nAnd remember last time where we had to\nselect, or we had to ungroup this and\n\n446\n00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.840\nthen get to this specific\nsquare to change it.\n\n447\n00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:14.880\nYou could go ahead and actually select it\nfrom the group, in the selection pane.\n\n448\n00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:20.510\nChange the color without even ungrouping\nit, which is really, really handy.\n\n449\n00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.165\nCuz I don't wanna have to always do that.\n\n450\n00:24:22.165 --> 00:24:25.991\nKeep it as a group, I just wanted to\nisolate that one particular part of that\n\n451\n00:24:25.991 --> 00:24:30.398\ngrouped element and you can use it through\nthat selection pane which is really great.\n\n452\n00:24:30.398 --> 00:24:33.351\nAnd you can change the stacking\norder if you ever wanted to.\n\n453\n00:24:33.351 --> 00:24:37.624\nSo I'm gonna collapse this group right\nhere and see if I had moved this,\n\n454\n00:24:37.624 --> 00:24:42.043\nI wanna put the sun in the back, you can\ndrag and from the selection pane and\n\n455\n00:24:42.043 --> 00:24:45.462\nusing that little line that\ncomes up you could go ahead and\n\n456\n00:24:45.462 --> 00:24:50.115\nI wanna, I don't wanna put it in the group\ngotta watch where that line stops.\n\n457\n00:24:50.115 --> 00:24:55.019\nI wanna make sure I put all\nthe way under that sun, so\n\n458\n00:24:55.019 --> 00:25:00.854\nI could have that and\nmaybe I'll change the color to yellow.\n\n459\n00:25:00.854 --> 00:25:03.310\nWe have a yellow circle, but that's okay.\n\n460\n00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:07.180\nYou get the idea of the selection\npaint hopefully because it\n\n461\n00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.390\nis really really great.\n\n462\n00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:10.430\nI really really enjoy the selection pane.\n\n463\n00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:12.970\nI'm glad that they added\nthis to PowerPoint.\n\n464\n00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:15.000\n&gt;&gt; All right Vaughn.\n\n465\n00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.590\nI'm noticing that around that shape\nthere's a little yellow dot there.\n\n466\n00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:19.570\nWhat is that about?\n\n467\n00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.170\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the dot and the sun.\n\n468\n00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:25.360\nYou'll actually see this\non a couple shapes within\n\n469\n00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.930\nthe shapes that you can add in PowerPoint.\n\n470\n00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:30.040\nI'm gonna change the field color so\n\n471\n00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.870\nmakes it a little bit easier\nto see that yellow dot.\n\n472\n00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:36.790\nWhat that means is think about these\nsun rays are a certain length.\n\n473\n00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:37.968\nWell, you can change that.\n\n474\n00:25:37.968 --> 00:25:39.428\nIf you click on that yellow dot,\n\n475\n00:25:39.428 --> 00:25:42.033\nit actually turns to like\nan arrowhead.without a tail.\n\n476\n00:25:42.033 --> 00:25:44.615\nYou see, if I click hold and\ndrag it's like, ooh, I can make-\n\n477\n00:25:44.615 --> 00:25:45.115\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n478\n00:25:45.115 --> 00:25:48.900\n&gt;&gt; The rays longer on the sun.\n\n479\n00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.040\nAnother shape that you can see that with.\n\n480\n00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.900\nAnd I'm actually in the Format\ntab to add another shape.\n\n481\n00:25:54.900 --> 00:26:02.460\nJust really quickly you can go to the I\ncan't find the arch, where did it go?\n\n482\n00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:05.420\nOkay.\nI know you can do it with the smiley face,\n\n483\n00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.255\nwait, there it is,\n\n484\n00:26:08.255 --> 00:26:14.780\nwow, I couldn't find it [LAUGH].\n\n485\n00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:19.210\nThere's actually two dots in\nthis to where if I click and\n\n486\n00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:22.860\nhold on this to where it's\ngoing to make it like a half or\n\n487\n00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:28.130\na quarter Of this and then I could\nalso change here the thickness.\n\n488\n00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:32.931\nI'm a little lost for words, just grab it\nand move it around and see what happens.\n\n489\n00:26:32.931 --> 00:26:37.490\n[LAUGH] And so you can see that we'll go\nahead and that's an interesting shape.\n\n490\n00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:40.836\nSo you could go ahead and\nchange your little yellow dots on that.\n\n491\n00:26:40.836 --> 00:26:42.294\nI know the smiley face has another one.\n\n492\n00:26:42.294 --> 00:26:46.580\nSo if I click, hold instead of making\nit smile you can make it frown.\n\n493\n00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.930\nDash dash that,\nwe want to smile because we're so\n\n494\n00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:53.510\nhappy from using Powerpoint\nthat it just brightens our day.\n\n495\n00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:56.993\nSo those are some of the things that\nyou can do with the yellow dots.\n\n496\n00:26:56.993 --> 00:27:01.441\nAnd I did want to show you some of, like\nit's a newer feature in Powerpoint but\n\n497\n00:27:01.441 --> 00:27:05.755\nit kind of goes back to some of those\nother graphical manipulation programs\n\n498\n00:27:05.755 --> 00:27:08.094\nwhere you can combine shapes together.\n\n499\n00:27:08.094 --> 00:27:13.029\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo a quick little insert a basic circle so\n\n500\n00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:18.290\nI'm just gonna click and\nthen I'm going to duplicate this circle.\n\n501\n00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:23.180\nNow one way is you could go ahead and\ncopy and then you can paste.\n\n502\n00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:28.320\nAnd then it goes ahead and gives you\nthat auto guides that happen here,\n\n503\n00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:33.450\nor you can use the control drag\nmethod which is a shortcut of where,\n\n504\n00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:38.820\nsee if I hold the control key down\nit actually leaves a little plus\n\n505\n00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:42.760\non the top of my arrow and if I click\nhold and drag I can drag that over.\n\n506\n00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.790\nThe other nice thing,\nI'm still holding my mouse by the way.\n\n507\n00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:49.019\nThe other cool thing is it's gonna\nshow you the spaces in between\n\n508\n00:27:49.019 --> 00:27:52.317\nyour shapes to give you\nthat same equal distance.\n\n509\n00:27:52.317 --> 00:27:52.979\nLove it.\n\n510\n00:27:52.979 --> 00:27:58.225\nSo if I let go of my mouse you could see\nthat the control drag will allow me to.\n\n511\n00:27:58.225 --> 00:28:00.612\n[SOUND] Create multiple objects.\n\n512\n00:28:00.612 --> 00:28:01.600\nOkay.\n\n513\n00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.980\nAnd if I wanted to just to make it\nquicker, I'm gonna set all three of these,\n\n514\n00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:11.200\nhold that Ctrl Key again and\nthen drag down to make multiple circles.\n\n515\n00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.870\nAnd if I wanted to select them all.\n\n516\n00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:14.810\nI'm gonna click, hold and drag again.\n\n517\n00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:18.550\nI'm gonna hold the Shift Key and\n\n518\n00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:23.070\nmy corner just to make it a little\nbigger to make it easier for us to see.\n\n519\n00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.730\nAll right, so\nthere's something combine shapes,\n\n520\n00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:31.607\nlike if I took this circle, maybe I make\nthis circle just a little bit bigger, and\n\n521\n00:28:31.607 --> 00:28:35.718\nI put a circle here and I put a circle\nhere, what does that look like?\n\n522\n00:28:35.718 --> 00:28:36.811\nLooks like a mickey mouse.\n\n523\n00:28:36.811 --> 00:28:38.284\n&gt;&gt; Mouse.\n&gt;&gt; Like a mouse or a bear maybe, right?\n\n524\n00:28:38.284 --> 00:28:38.890\n&gt;&gt; Maybe a bear.\n\n525\n00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:42.820\n&gt;&gt; And if I group this just\nto show you really quick.\n\n526\n00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:46.880\nIf I group it, it's still three circles.\n\n527\n00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.330\nI want it to be one element.\n\n528\n00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:50.840\nso I'm gonna undo that.\n\n529\n00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:54.470\nYou can unite these all right.\n\n530\n00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:56.423\nI need to select these, all right.\n\n531\n00:28:56.423 --> 00:29:01.187\nCome over here to Format, come over here\nto our combined, or merged save, sorry,\n\n532\n00:29:01.187 --> 00:29:02.870\nthey call it merge.\n\n533\n00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.700\nSo you can see that I want to\nunion these shapes together, so\n\n534\n00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.560\nif I click on that now it is not,\nthis is not a group shape.\n\n535\n00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:15.725\nThis is a free form shape that I\nhave used to merge these pieces\n\n536\n00:29:15.725 --> 00:29:20.503\ntogether to create one whole\nentity which is kinda fun.\n\n537\n00:29:20.503 --> 00:29:22.521\nAnd you can use these in different ways.\n\n538\n00:29:22.521 --> 00:29:26.370\nHere I'm gonna stack these on\ntop of each other like this.\n\n539\n00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:31.130\nIf I select these three, and it really\nlike, what does it mean to combine,\n\n540\n00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:32.880\nversus fragment, versus intersect?\n\n541\n00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.760\nWell, it's nice that\nthey actually show you.\n\n542\n00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.010\nWhat the preview looks like.\n\n543\n00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:40.450\nSo if I combine these, you see that's\nactually like, it's like poking out\n\n544\n00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:46.244\nthe whole of those overlapping elements,\nand if I were to apply a drop shadow\n\n545\n00:29:46.244 --> 00:29:52.160\njust to see that drop shadow is actually\ncoming in between those spaces.\n\n546\n00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:58.390\nWhich would never be able to achieved\nif you had used just a simple group or\n\n547\n00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:59.490\nthe different elements like that,\n\n548\n00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:02.850\nyou're actually making\nshapes out of other shapes.\n\n549\n00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:04.190\nIt can be really, really handy.\n\n550\n00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:09.425\nSo that merging shapes is a newer\nfeature that I find quite enjoyable for\n\n551\n00:30:09.425 --> 00:30:13.091\nsomebody that likes to\ncreate different bears and\n\n552\n00:30:13.091 --> 00:30:16.949\nhoops that the bears can jump through or\nsomething.\n\n553\n00:30:16.949 --> 00:30:18.577\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now Von,\n\n554\n00:30:18.577 --> 00:30:22.129\nwith that bear that you\nhave is a solid color.\n\n555\n00:30:22.129 --> 00:30:25.014\nIs there a way we can apply maybe\nlet's say like a gradient to it,\n\n556\n00:30:25.014 --> 00:30:28.670\neven though it's three separate\nobjects that we've merged together?\n\n557\n00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:30.290\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cuz it now is one object.\n\n558\n00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:33.790\nAnd whether it was one object or\nthree objects, there was one thing that\n\n559\n00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:36.820\nI left out because we were always\ncoming up here to the Format.\n\n560\n00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.870\nAnd we're coming up here\nto the Fill a Shape, and\n\n561\n00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:43.150\nyes, there is Shape fill and\nthere is a gradient right here.\n\n562\n00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.040\nBut the one thing I wanted to point out\nwas that all of these things that we've\n\n563\n00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.790\nbeen doing to the ribbon that I\nsaid you could right click a lot of\n\n564\n00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:54.120\na formatting you can do by right\nclicking and going to format shape\n\n565\n00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:58.930\nright here which is kinda nice cuz then it\ncomes back over into another task pane.\n\n566\n00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:03.910\nI'm gonna turn off or\nclose out of the selection pane.\n\n567\n00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:06.710\nSo you could see that just like when we\nwere formatting the background of our\n\n568\n00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:07.680\nslides.\n\n569\n00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.470\nIt just gives you a lot more options.\n\n570\n00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:15.900\nAll within here so it's just,\nI just find it a little easier to apply\n\n571\n00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.610\nthings that are a little bit outside of\nthe box besides just the solid colors to\n\n572\n00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:24.600\ndo that right click and format the shape\ncuz then I can go into that gradient fill,\n\n573\n00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.890\nuse those color stops that\nwe were using before and\n\n574\n00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:32.390\nI can start applying those different\ncolors, ooff that is not pretty looking.\n\n575\n00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:35.760\nBut you can see that I could go ahead and\nuse those gradients I could\n\n576\n00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:40.620\nalso go into the different effects and\nI could also go into the shapes and\n\n577\n00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:44.200\nthe sizes that were right\nup here on the ribbon.\n\n578\n00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.890\nIt's just another way of getting\ntot he same thing, just like in any\n\n579\n00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:51.900\nproduct there's usually at least four or\nfive different ways to get to it.\n\n580\n00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.780\nSo it allows you to do that.\n\n581\n00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:58.487\n&gt;&gt; There's only one more thing I wanted\nto ask about Von in what we've just\n\n582\n00:31:58.487 --> 00:31:59.280\nseen here.\n\n583\n00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.380\nWhat if I wanted to label,\nlike the bear that you actually had.\n\n584\n00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.884\nCan I actually put words inside that bear.\n\n585\n00:32:04.884 --> 00:32:05.988\nYou can.\n\n586\n00:32:05.988 --> 00:32:08.080\nAnd actually in this format\nshape that we were just on,\n\n587\n00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.904\nthere is an option over there for\ntext options.\n\n588\n00:32:09.904 --> 00:32:14.144\nAnd so I was wondering if that spurred\nyour brain to maybe think that?\n\n589\n00:32:14.144 --> 00:32:15.513\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; And it really did.\n\n590\n00:32:15.513 --> 00:32:17.153\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good, all right, perfect.\n\n591\n00:32:17.153 --> 00:32:20.491\nSo I have this bear and\nthis could be for any of the shapes.\n\n592\n00:32:20.491 --> 00:32:25.214\nSo if I wanted to add text to this bear,\nI remember I would always actually go and\n\n593\n00:32:25.214 --> 00:32:28.809\nmake a new text box, and\nput it on top and group it together.\n\n594\n00:32:28.809 --> 00:32:30.861\nUntil I found out that\nit's actually a really\n\n595\n00:32:30.861 --> 00:32:31.477\nway to do it-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n596\n00:32:31.477 --> 00:32:33.380\n&gt;&gt; You just start typing.\n\n597\n00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:34.810\nReally?\nOkay, so yes.\n\n598\n00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:40.093\nSo if I go ahead and have this\nbear selected, and I type in bear.\n\n599\n00:32:40.093 --> 00:32:43.797\nAll right, perfect,\nthat's how you can add text into a shape.\n\n600\n00:32:43.797 --> 00:32:48.770\nI mean, I could hit Enter and\nI could add more text.\n\n601\n00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:53.269\nI mean, you can add as much as you\nwanted to in that shape that you have.\n\n602\n00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:56.550\nI think I'll just stick\nwith just bear right there.\n\n603\n00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:59.709\nAnd you can format this text\njust you would anything else.\n\n604\n00:32:59.709 --> 00:33:02.222\nI could go ahead and select that text.\n\n605\n00:33:02.222 --> 00:33:04.720\nI could come over here to Home tab.\n\n606\n00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.250\nI could go ahead and make it bold and\nI could make it bigger and so on and\n\n607\n00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:10.010\nso forth.\n\n608\n00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:12.718\nI could even, if I wanted to,\nI clicked off of it, sorry.\n\n609\n00:33:12.718 --> 00:33:15.984\nIf I select it back over\nhere on that Format tab,\n\n610\n00:33:15.984 --> 00:33:18.385\nover here it says WordArt styles.\n\n611\n00:33:18.385 --> 00:33:22.406\nWell since I added text into the shape,\nI can go ahead and\n\n612\n00:33:22.406 --> 00:33:26.955\nadd any type of WordArt styles,\ncuz this is looking so pretty.\n\n613\n00:33:26.955 --> 00:33:31.417\n[LAUGH] In with this bear or\nover here with the Format shape,\n\n614\n00:33:31.417 --> 00:33:33.980\nhow I got to right clicking on it.\n\n615\n00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:37.622\nI can go into those Text options and\ndo the same thing there.\n\n616\n00:33:37.622 --> 00:33:41.028\nCuz maybe I wanted to make\nthis bright yellow and\n\n617\n00:33:41.028 --> 00:33:46.321\nthen I can go into the drop shadows and\nso on and so forth, and go like that.\n\n618\n00:33:46.321 --> 00:33:49.418\nOne of the things that\nI did wanna point out,\n\n619\n00:33:49.418 --> 00:33:55.160\nis you see how bear he's kind of higher\nup within the shape in the Shape options.\n\n620\n00:33:55.160 --> 00:34:00.662\nIt's not text, and everybody always\nwants to go to the Text options, but\n\n621\n00:34:00.662 --> 00:34:06.720\nit is within the shape, is that you could\ngo into keep on, whoops that's not it.\n\n622\n00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:13.640\nGo into the line, I was wrong,\nit is in, there it is, okay, sorry.\n\n623\n00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:17.933\nI was right, [LAUGH] you do go into\nthe Shape options, not the Text options.\n\n624\n00:34:17.933 --> 00:34:22.780\nWhat I was looking for was this box,\nthe size and properties.\n\n625\n00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:24.089\nWhew, I was going along this way.\n\n626\n00:34:24.089 --> 00:34:24.609\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm like,\n\n627\n00:34:24.609 --> 00:34:27.770\nam I telling them the wrong one, no,\nI know it's in the Shape options.\n\n628\n00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.747\nOkay, good, I'm still right [LAUGH] or\nat least for this time.\n\n629\n00:34:30.747 --> 00:34:35.531\nIt is a textbox in that Shape\nproperties of where you can change\n\n630\n00:34:35.531 --> 00:34:38.296\nthe different types of alignment.\n\n631\n00:34:38.296 --> 00:34:41.685\nMaybe I wanted the text\ndirection to go up and\n\n632\n00:34:41.685 --> 00:34:44.900\ndown, I think I just keep it horizontal.\n\n633\n00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:49.410\nBut you can see that I can change\nhow it's going to align to the bear\n\n634\n00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:54.240\nin the relationship to the shape,\nwhether it's on the bottom.\n\n635\n00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.871\nOr maybe if I go ahead and\nput it back in the middle, but\n\n636\n00:34:56.871 --> 00:34:59.398\nI need to basically kinda\nbump it down a little bit.\n\n637\n00:34:59.398 --> 00:35:03.559\nYou see down here you have your left,\nright, top, and bottom margin.\n\n638\n00:35:03.559 --> 00:35:08.863\nSo if I kinda bump it down or\nincrease the top margin, see how I\n\n639\n00:35:08.863 --> 00:35:15.820\ncan kind of move it down to this specific\nplace that I want that text to go.\n\n640\n00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.610\nAnd that's usually something that always\nbothers me is that I can add the text in.\n\n641\n00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:24.934\nBut I couldn't control exactly where the\ntext was and to me that looks centered.\n\n642\n00:35:24.934 --> 00:35:28.710\nAnd that's where I really wanted it to be,\nso it took me a while to find that.\n\n643\n00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:32.870\nSo I really wanted to point that out to\nyou guys, cuz it was an important thing\n\n644\n00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:36.260\nthat I always wanted to know about\nwhen adding text to a shape.\n\n645\n00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:41.518\nAnd then there is one last thing that\nactually I wanted to add here, Ronnie,\n\n646\n00:35:41.518 --> 00:35:46.460\nsince so glad you pointed out adding\nthis text, is editing the points.\n\n647\n00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:50.294\nBecause we've pretty much gone over almost\nevery single option on this ribbon.\n\n648\n00:35:50.294 --> 00:35:53.521\nSo I wanted to show you this one,\nthe Edit Shape.\n\n649\n00:35:53.521 --> 00:35:57.210\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nadd another shape just for fun.\n\n650\n00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:00.330\nLet's go ahead and\nmake this a little lightning bolt.\n\n651\n00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:04.390\nAnd maybe I'll just go ahead and\nrotate it, move this off to the side.\n\n652\n00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:08.960\nI wanna make the top of the lightning\nbolt bigger, but not the whole thing,\n\n653\n00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.890\nmaybe just the top edges.\n\n654\n00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:15.430\nSo that's where you could go\ninto taking this Edit Shape and\n\n655\n00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:17.320\nyou can edit the points.\n\n656\n00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.840\nBecause if you think about it,\nit's just like click, click, click, click,\n\n657\n00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.650\nclick where these points connect.\n\n658\n00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:25.444\nThat's where you could go ahead and\nit's gonna show each individual point.\n\n659\n00:36:25.444 --> 00:36:31.305\nAnd I can then drag those points up,\nthat's a little scary looking now.\n\n660\n00:36:31.305 --> 00:36:34.152\n[LAUGH] But you can see that I can\nmove those points individuals.\n\n661\n00:36:34.152 --> 00:36:37.222\nAnd to not get too crazy\nwith editing the points but\n\n662\n00:36:37.222 --> 00:36:40.454\nyou do have the ways that\nyou can make these bending.\n\n663\n00:36:40.454 --> 00:36:43.227\nThese are where you start\ngetting into vector shapes and\n\n664\n00:36:43.227 --> 00:36:45.750\nyou start getting into\nyour besiege curves.\n\n665\n00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:49.450\nAnd these are your point handles\nwhere you can kinda change\n\n666\n00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:52.230\nthe direction of the path.\n\n667\n00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:56.060\nThat might be getting a little\ncrazier besides just you know what?\n\n668\n00:36:56.060 --> 00:37:00.668\nJust see what it does, like okay, well\nthen we can grab that pull that out and\n\n669\n00:37:00.668 --> 00:37:04.075\nthat makes it a little bit more hoopy and\nless straight.\n\n670\n00:37:04.075 --> 00:37:08.906\nSo experiment with that, but then you\ncan start getting into some kind of\n\n671\n00:37:08.906 --> 00:37:13.900\nreally interesting looking shapes by\nediting the points of your shapes.\n\n672\n00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:17.591\nAnd creating custom shapes that you\ncould do all sorts of fun things with.\n\n673\n00:37:17.591 --> 00:37:18.600\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne.\n\n674\n00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.845\nWell thank you again for\n\n675\n00:37:19.845 --> 00:37:23.153\nhelping us out with dealing with\nshapes inside of PowerPoint.\n\n676\n00:37:23.153 --> 00:37:26.596\nRemember that shapes can really become\nsomething fairly powerful to make\n\n677\n00:37:26.596 --> 00:37:27.872\nthe point that you need to,\n\n678\n00:37:27.872 --> 00:37:31.620\nespecially if you can't find everything\nelse in a preset that you want.\n\n679\n00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:35.141\nAdding in some shades, being able to\nmanipulate them, change their color,\n\n680\n00:37:35.141 --> 00:37:38.825\nbeing able to add text to them is really a\nvaluable tool that we can really make sure\n\n681\n00:37:38.825 --> 00:37:41.659\nthat you have the customization\nthat you really want to have.\n\n682\n00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:45.400\nSo that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n683\n00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.383\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n684\n00:37:48.383 --> 00:37:49.190\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n685\n00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:53.256\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Microsoft PowerPoint 2016.\n\n686\n00:37:53.256 --> 00:37:59.992\n[MUSIC]\n\n687\n00:37:59.992 --> 00:38:02.410\n&gt;&gt;

Smart Art is a combination of shapes and text and formatting that help to convey the relationship of data we want to present, according to the duo.  They demonstrate how easy it is use it and add them to our presentation.  Vonne demonstrates how to add shapes, delete and modify shapes to make our point.  She demonstrates the use of lists and the hierarchy within the Smart Art to Convey topics as well as organizational order.",

00:00:12.003\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:15.440\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.700\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today,\nyou're watching Microsoft PowerPoint 2016.\n\n6\n00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.080\nWe're specifically gonna be diving\ninto the realm of smart art.\n\n7\n00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.110\nAnd here to help us\nunderstand what it is and\n\n8\n00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.955\nwhy we tend to use it,\nis gonna be Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:30.570\nVonne, welcome back to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.836\nSo let's begin with that\nparticular question.\n\n11\n00:00:32.836 --> 00:00:36.310\nWhat is it and\nwhy would we choose to use smart art?\n\n12\n00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.440\n&gt;&gt; Perfect introduction, exactly.\n\n13\n00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.280\nSo smart art, what is it?\n\n14\n00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.887\nIt's art that's smart.\n\n15\n00:00:41.887 --> 00:00:42.416\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n16\n00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:45.840\n&gt;&gt; And we're done.\n[LAUGH] No it's really just another way\n\n17\n00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.035\nthat we can graphically\nrepresent art information.\n\n18\n00:00:50.035 --> 00:00:54.281\nBecause we've been using slides where\nwe just add some text in there and\n\n19\n00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:56.917\nmake a list and\nbullet points to talk about.\n\n20\n00:00:56.917 --> 00:01:01.327\nBut you could if you wanted to,\nwhat if it was an easy way for\n\n21\n00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.937\nyou to be able to put those points or\n\n22\n00:01:03.937 --> 00:01:08.440\ninformation into some type\nof graphic graph-like thing?\n\n23\n00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.744\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Representation?\n\n24\n00:01:09.744 --> 00:01:13.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, certainly, a great,\ngreat explanation here Vonne.\n\n25\n00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.550\nIt's really honestly,\neasiest to show you what it looks like.\n\n26\n00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.210\nSo we can get an idea pf what\nexactly smart art can do for us.\n\n27\n00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.674\nSo we're gonna go through\na couple examples.\n\n28\n00:01:23.674 --> 00:01:25.968\nSo why don't we go ahead and\njust dive right in?\n\n29\n00:01:25.968 --> 00:01:29.985\nI haven't even started PowerPoint\nbecause I wanted to do this episode with\n\n30\n00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:30.630\na new file.\n\n31\n00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.029\nWe're just gonna start from scratch and\njust kind of throw the smart art in there.\n\n32\n00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:36.420\nWe're gonna put some information in it and\nsee what we can do.\n\n33\n00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.422\nSo let's go ahead and start PowerPoint,\n\n34\n00:01:39.422 --> 00:01:42.781\nI'm gonna use my search bar,\nget us started.\n\n35\n00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:44.807\nAnd I don't know why I'm\nnot full screened yet.\n\n36\n00:01:44.807 --> 00:01:46.014\nBut I can go ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:46.014 --> 00:01:50.067\nfull screen by clicking our maximize\nbutton to go ahead and do that.\n\n38\n00:01:50.067 --> 00:01:53.508\nAll right, so why don't we go ahead and\nstart with a blank presentation?\n\n39\n00:01:53.508 --> 00:01:55.600\nCuz that's where we're gonna go.\n\n40\n00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.650\nAnd just to have fun we're just gonna add\nour little SmartArt with a capital A.\n\n41\n00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.622\nAnd we can add our subtitle to go along.\n\n42\n00:02:04.622 --> 00:02:06.662\nAnd whoops, how about we do that?\n\n43\n00:02:06.662 --> 00:02:09.680\nAll right, perfect, so\nwe've got our title slide.\n\n44\n00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.240\nWe're gonna add a new slide\nwith our title and content.\n\n45\n00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.170\nAnd we've been doing this\nthroughout the entire show and\n\n46\n00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.080\nwe've been using all of these\nlittle buttons along the way.\n\n47\n00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.070\nWell, actually we haven't been using the\nbuttons to much because we haven't done\n\n48\n00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.832\nthe Tables and the Charts,\nwhich we'll get to.\n\n49\n00:02:23.832 --> 00:02:26.910\nBut we did do the pictures,\nthat was one of them.\n\n50\n00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.808\nBut one of the other buttons that we\nhave here in out content placeholder is\n\n51\n00:02:31.808 --> 00:02:34.577\nour option to insert a smart art graphic.\n\n52\n00:02:34.577 --> 00:02:38.050\nSo that's a good place\nof any to put this in.\n\n53\n00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.260\nSo we're gonna go ahead and click on it.\n\n54\n00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.048\nAnd then it goes ahead and\nbrings us into Smart Art Graphic Library.\n\n55\n00:02:44.048 --> 00:02:46.701\nWhere I have all these different ways and\n\n56\n00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:51.160\nexamples of how we want to organize\nthe content of our information.\n\n57\n00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.406\nSo if we were going to be talking\nabout cats, dogs, and horses,\n\n58\n00:02:55.406 --> 00:02:59.274\nand those were our main talking\npoints within this slide.\n\n59\n00:02:59.274 --> 00:03:04.900\nWell, why don't I go ahead and look at\nthe different options that PowerPoint has\n\n60\n00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.048\nto insert a list in pictures, or\nin graphical elements, how about that?\n\n61\n00:03:10.048 --> 00:03:13.981\nSo you can see that I can put them in\nhexagons, ooh, that looks fancy, or\n\n62\n00:03:13.981 --> 00:03:16.240\nI can do them in just certain boxes.\n\n63\n00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.652\nYou have different ways,\n\n64\n00:03:17.652 --> 00:03:20.934\nthink about if you had different\ntopics that had subtopics.\n\n65\n00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:25.200\nThis could be a nice way to\nrepresent that information in\n\n66\n00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.450\na somewhat graphical format, so\nit's not just text on a slide.\n\n67\n00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.990\nYou can add a little pizzazz,\nwe'll call it Ronnie.\n\n68\n00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.020\nWe can pizzazz it all\nup with our different\n\n69\n00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.620\nways that we can represent lists.\n\n70\n00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.540\nAnd you can see over on the left hand\nside that you have different categories\n\n71\n00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.040\nof what you are wanting\nto put on the slide.\n\n72\n00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.650\nMaybe we are talking about the process of\nwhat we do when we get up in the morning.\n\n73\n00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.170\nWe get up, we brush our teeth,\nwe drink our coffee.\n\n74\n00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.000\nThat could be something that we could\nrepresent with arrows along the way.\n\n75\n00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.915\nHere, let me go ahead and\nget to that so you could see.\n\n76\n00:04:00.915 --> 00:04:03.153\nSo you could see if I\nclick on some of these,\n\n77\n00:04:03.153 --> 00:04:06.725\nit's going to give me a nice preview\nover on that right-hand side.\n\n78\n00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:11.517\nSo that's a nice way that we can represent\na step by step process that we're\n\n79\n00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:13.127\ntrying to present here.\n\n80\n00:04:13.127 --> 00:04:17.786\nAnd you can go on down through\nthe different categories like a cycle, or\n\n81\n00:04:17.786 --> 00:04:21.836\na hierarchy if we were doing\nan organizational chart matrix.\n\n82\n00:04:21.836 --> 00:04:27.370\nDifferent ways we can represent how\nthings interact with each other,\n\n83\n00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.476\nand the relationships that they have.\n\n84\n00:04:30.476 --> 00:04:34.134\nOkay, so we've got all of these\ndifferent types of smart art,\n\n85\n00:04:34.134 --> 00:04:35.806\nso let's start with a list.\n\n86\n00:04:35.806 --> 00:04:39.222\nAnd we're gonna just start with the very\nfirst one, just go super basic,\n\n87\n00:04:39.222 --> 00:04:40.389\nwith a basic block list.\n\n88\n00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.930\nOkay perfect, go ahead and click OK,\nand it inserts this smart art graphic.\n\n89\n00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.390\nSo you can see that it starts off with\nthese five boxes that we could then\n\n90\n00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.380\nadd text into it.\n\n91\n00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.320\nAnd that is what this little text\nin the little brackets says,\n\n92\n00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.775\ngiven its indication that we can add text.\n\n93\n00:04:57.775 --> 00:05:02.450\nJust kind of like how we have our\nplaceholders and like the double tap to\n\n94\n00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.670\nadd titles, trying to just give us\na little bit of a hint of what we can do.\n\n95\n00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.050\nSo with this selected, or\nyou can click your cursor in it,\n\n96\n00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.940\nwhichever way you want to go.\n\n97\n00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.990\nEither way,\nit would still go ahead and add text.\n\n98\n00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.041\nJust like we had added text and shapes in\nour shapes episode, these are just shapes.\n\n99\n00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:24.240\nAll right, so we're gonna just type in\ncats, because that's what I said earlier.\n\n100\n00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.070\nAnd if I wanna add text to this other one,\nyou click and you can add Dogs.\n\n101\n00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.022\nNow notice I'm adding in words that\nare pretty small, or just a few letters.\n\n102\n00:05:33.022 --> 00:05:37.952\nSo it's automatically sizing\nthe text in those objects to\n\n103\n00:05:37.952 --> 00:05:43.300\naccommodate whatever size,\ntext, or words that I have.\n\n104\n00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:50.190\nSo if I came over here to this third\none and said, This is more text\n\n105\n00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.555\nin this shape, but you can see, I'm trying\nto type and talk and it's not working.\n\n106\n00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:57.160\nYes, there we go.\n\n107\n00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.220\nI'm just gonna [LAUGH] go with that one.\n\n108\n00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.549\nSo you can that it's automatically\nresizing this text as I type in the box.\n\n109\n00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:07.271\nBut the nice thing is,\nto stay consistent in the other shapes,\n\n110\n00:06:07.271 --> 00:06:12.260\nthe cats and the dogs,\nare automatically gonna autosize as well,\n\n111\n00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.668\nwhich I like,\nbecause I do like uniformity.\n\n112\n00:06:15.668 --> 00:06:20.420\nSo I think that's a nice way to\nkinda help us along, and resize or\n\n113\n00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.460\nauto-fit the text to whatever box\nhas the largest amount of text.\n\n114\n00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.653\nAnd so it will go ahead and\naccommodate all of the objects, and so\n\n115\n00:06:29.653 --> 00:06:31.525\nyou can keep on adding text.\n\n116\n00:06:31.525 --> 00:06:39.213\nBut what if I only want to talk\nabout Cats, Dogs, and Horses?\n\n117\n00:06:39.213 --> 00:06:43.855\nIt's all I have, well, I have three,\nall right sorry, that will be two,\n\n118\n00:06:43.855 --> 00:06:48.304\n[LAUGH] two other boxes in a smaller\ngraphic that I'm not wanting to use.\n\n119\n00:06:48.304 --> 00:06:51.760\nAll you gotta do is just delete it, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.746\nYou can click,\nnow if you have your cursor,\n\n121\n00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:56.497\nif you have a flashing cursor in that and\nI hit the Delete key.\n\n122\n00:06:56.497 --> 00:07:01.401\nYou could see that nothing's gonna happen\nright now, because it's thinking that you\n\n123\n00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:04.780\nwant to delete text in that text box,\nor that shape.\n\n124\n00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.010\nThat's not what I wanna do,\nI wanna eliminate the entire shape.\n\n125\n00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.020\nSo what you have to do\nis select to effect,\n\n126\n00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.390\nyou have to select what\nyou want to get rid of.\n\n127\n00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:19.000\nSo I need to get to that four pointed\narrow on the edge to get the whole shape,\n\n128\n00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.210\nnot the text in the box.\n\n129\n00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.480\nSo when I have that, now you can hit\nthe Delete key on your keyboard.\n\n130\n00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.970\nAnd it will go away, or the Backspace key,\ndepending on which one you have.\n\n131\n00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.740\nSo you can go ahead, and I don't want\nthat one, so I can ahead and delete that.\n\n132\n00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.775\nAnd now I have my three shapes\nthat I wanna talk about.\n\n133\n00:07:37.775 --> 00:07:43.430\nSo a different way that I can represent\ntopics that I wanna talk about\n\n134\n00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:48.790\nin a graphical format rather than\njust plain text on the page.\n\n135\n00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.017\nI guess this would be a slide,\nnot the page, Ronnie, so-\n\n136\n00:07:51.017 --> 00:07:51.802\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n137\n00:07:51.802 --> 00:07:56.680\nVonne, taking the idea here where we\ncan remove those different shapes.\n\n138\n00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.329\nThat's a really good thing if I\nactually need to to have less.\n\n139\n00:07:59.329 --> 00:08:04.280\nBut since I started off with five,\nlet's say is that the maximum that I have,\n\n140\n00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.942\nthough, in the shape,\nor can I add a six or\n\n141\n00:08:06.942 --> 00:08:11.840\nseventh box to add in something like\nbunnies and elephants if I wanted to?\n\n142\n00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.180\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie, you know I'm always\nwilling to add bunnies into the mix\n\n143\n00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.790\nwhen we're talking about any type\nof animal, so that's a great point.\n\n144\n00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.365\nWhat if I wanted to add a shape?\n\n145\n00:08:22.365 --> 00:08:25.070\nI told you how to delete one,\nbut how do I add one in?\n\n146\n00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.160\nAnd whether that be that I started\nwith three and now I need four, or\n\n147\n00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.150\nI started with five and now I need six or\nseven, let's add some shapes.\n\n148\n00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.128\nSo let's get back in here.\n\n149\n00:08:32.128 --> 00:08:35.717\nYou can see that I'm on the Horses object,\nso\n\n150\n00:08:35.717 --> 00:08:41.960\nthat makes a difference to when you adding\na shape, does it go before or after?\n\n151\n00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.960\nSo always make sure that you know\nwhere you're at before you go.\n\n152\n00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.165\nSo on this contextual tab, this designed\ntab that is part of the SmartArt tools\n\n153\n00:08:50.165 --> 00:08:55.000\nthat has come up because I have added this\nparticular element and I have it selected.\n\n154\n00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.688\nOver here on the left you have Add Shape,\nand I can just click it right now and\n\n155\n00:08:59.688 --> 00:09:03.052\nit would just do the default\noption of adding a shape.\n\n156\n00:09:03.052 --> 00:09:06.860\nBut you do have some other options\nthat you have in the drop down.\n\n157\n00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:11.089\nYou can see that do I want to add a shape\nafter, or do I wanna add a shape before?\n\n158\n00:09:11.089 --> 00:09:14.428\nAgain, depending on where I'm at, whether\nyou want it in the front or the back.\n\n159\n00:09:14.428 --> 00:09:17.751\nYou can see I do have some other\noptions that are grayed out,\n\n160\n00:09:17.751 --> 00:09:21.740\nthe reason those are grayed out is\nbecause I'm not in a SmartArt graphic\n\n161\n00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.820\nthat allows for above and below.\n\n162\n00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.770\nIf you were in some type of hierarchy,\n\n163\n00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.190\nthen that would be where\nyou could go up or down.\n\n164\n00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.790\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nadd a shape after.\n\n165\n00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.210\nI click on after and then it adds a shape.\n\n166\n00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:38.358\nAnd so I can go ahead and\ntype in bunnies and there we go.\n\n167\n00:09:38.358 --> 00:09:44.460\nAnd I've got all four topics that I want\nto include on this particular slide.\n\n168\n00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.205\nBut you can see that\nit's very blue right now.\n\n169\n00:09:47.205 --> 00:09:51.766\nWell one, because we don't have\nany theme that we have applied.\n\n170\n00:09:51.766 --> 00:09:56.709\nWe just have the Office theme, so that's\nalways the basic kind of stark background,\n\n171\n00:09:56.709 --> 00:09:57.749\nif you wanna say.\n\n172\n00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:02.920\nBut we'll get to design things in just\nsecond because I can go ahead and\n\n173\n00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:08.340\nchange the colors of this based\non whatever theme I'm working on.\n\n174\n00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.590\nAnd I can go into the colorful or\nmaybe a monochromatic look, and\n\n175\n00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.870\nI have these different\noptions of how it's going to\n\n176\n00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.670\napply the colors to these different\nshapes within the SmartArt.\n\n177\n00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:21.450\nI always like to go for\nthe colorful option.\n\n178\n00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.130\nAnd then you have over here on the,\nbeside the change colors,\n\n179\n00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.150\nyou have your options for\ndifferent styles.\n\n180\n00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:32.700\nNow this is where I, instead of formatting\nevery single individual shape like you can\n\n181\n00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.070\nwhen you're inserting a shape or inserting\na picture, it treats it all as one.\n\n182\n00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:41.003\nAnd it gives me some nice quick and easy\nways of making this look a little fancier\n\n183\n00:10:41.003 --> 00:10:45.960\nusing bevel and emboss and shadows, and\nwe could even go into some 3D-ness.\n\n184\n00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.898\nAnd like okay well,\n\n185\n00:10:46.898 --> 00:10:50.870\nthat might be, well that would be cute\nif we were talking about a keyboard.\n\n186\n00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.960\nBut you can see different\noptions that I have for\n\n187\n00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:59.860\nquickly making this SmartArt graphic look\njust a little fancier, little more fun.\n\n188\n00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.010\nSo maybe I'll go with\nthat option right there.\n\n189\n00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.370\nNow I am in a list SmartArt graphic,\n\n190\n00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:11.029\nwhat if I wanted to change it back to\nthose hexagons that I saw earlier?\n\n191\n00:11:11.029 --> 00:11:15.884\nWell you can see in the layouts it gives\nme all the different ways that lists\n\n192\n00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:17.618\ncan be shown in SmartArt.\n\n193\n00:11:17.618 --> 00:11:21.011\nSo maybe I could go ahead and\nput those hexagons in there.\n\n194\n00:11:21.011 --> 00:11:25.905\n[SOUND] That's a little small, or\nI could go into maybe have it stacked.\n\n195\n00:11:25.905 --> 00:11:30.902\nBut I think you get the idea here is that\nI can go ahead and quickly change all\n\n196\n00:11:30.902 --> 00:11:35.740\nof that content into easy ways of\nshowing different representations,\n\n197\n00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:40.520\ngraphical representations,\nof lists and it's pretty handy dandy.\n\n198\n00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.330\nI'm gonna go back to the beginning and\nthere we go.\n\n199\n00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.590\nGot some nice little\nSmartArt to start with.\n\n200\n00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.540\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vaughn, I see that every\ntime you even change the different shapes,\n\n201\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.270\nand that you put everything on\nthere that you wanted to do,\n\n202\n00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.440\nit changed everything but\nthe order of those shapes.\n\n203\n00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.000\nIs there somewhere we can\nactually move those around and\n\n204\n00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.080\nput them into another\norder if we needed to?\n\n205\n00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.250\n&gt;&gt; Yes there is.\n\n206\n00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.090\nAnd so let's go ahead and jump in there.\n\n207\n00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:06.370\nSo there's a couple of different things\nwe can do here with them being shapes.\n\n208\n00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.530\nNow, they are shapes so\n\n209\n00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:13.250\nyou can move individual pieces\nfree form if you wanted to.\n\n210\n00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.800\nSo if I have,\nI wanted to move bunnies around.\n\n211\n00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.343\nYou see I can click, hold, and drag, and\n\n212\n00:12:18.343 --> 00:12:22.868\nI can move this just like if I had entered\nit four squares and typed in text.\n\n213\n00:12:22.868 --> 00:12:26.903\nNow in this way,\nI mean it's nice to free form it, but\n\n214\n00:12:26.903 --> 00:12:31.570\nI've kinda lost the structure,\nor the overall kind of ease,\n\n215\n00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:36.986\nif you wanna say, of just putting in\nfour blocks as a SmartArt graphic.\n\n216\n00:12:36.986 --> 00:12:42.100\nOne whole piece, if you wanna say,\nof multiple shapes.\n\n217\n00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.740\nSo you could do this, but\nI didn't really want to do that.\n\n218\n00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.330\nAnd I just resized just\nto show you quickly.\n\n219\n00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.725\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use\nmy handy-dandy undo, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Z,\n\n220\n00:12:51.725 --> 00:12:56.740\nCtrl+Z, to get us back to where I have\nall the squares where I want them to be.\n\n221\n00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:01.320\nTo me, the easiest way to change the order\nof this, if I want cats then bunnies then\n\n222\n00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:07.660\ndogs and horses, is to go over into\nthe list view of your SmartArt graphics.\n\n223\n00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.860\nOver here on the right, that will be\nthe other right, that would be the left.\n\n224\n00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:17.370\nYou can see there's this little triangle\noff to the side, if you click on that\n\n225\n00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:22.600\nit actually pulls this out to where\nyou're seeing this in, well, a list view.\n\n226\n00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.040\nBecause that's really all\nit is is taking lists and\n\n227\n00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.470\njust graphically representing them\ndifferently, which is pretty cool.\n\n228\n00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:34.070\nSo if I wanted to I could take bunnies and\nI could cut this.\n\n229\n00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:37.710\nAnd then you can see, that's also another\nway that I can start removing and\n\n230\n00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.710\nadding shapes is in this list view,\nwhich could be really handy.\n\n231\n00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:44.630\nI can come after Cats, and\nthen I could go ahead and paste, whoops.\n\n232\n00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.790\nBut now it pasted it in with the Cats.\n\n233\n00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:47.710\nThat's okay.\n\n234\n00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:48.330\n&gt;&gt; Cat bunnies.\n\n235\n00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.290\n&gt;&gt; It's a catbunny.\n\n236\n00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:49.880\nIt's a bunnycat.\n\n237\n00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.244\nThat would be an awesome animal.\n\n238\n00:13:51.244 --> 00:13:53.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you can see that if I wanted to,\n\n239\n00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:56.670\njust like when we were adding\nlists into our slides,\n\n240\n00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.880\nthis is the same way that you add\nlists no matter where you're at.\n\n241\n00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.730\nI can just hit Enter and\nit makes that new bullet or\n\n242\n00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:08.640\nthat new bullet in this list, and I can go\nahead and do it that way which I think is\n\n243\n00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.060\na lot easier than trying to\nmove all these shapes around.\n\n244\n00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.090\nAnd while I'm here, what if I wanted\nto go ahead and add some other animals?\n\n245\n00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.592\nWell if I'm right here on horses,\nwe could hit Enter and\n\n246\n00:14:19.592 --> 00:14:21.464\nthen we can add in antelopes.\n\n247\n00:14:21.464 --> 00:14:25.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we can go ahead an add in turtles.\n\n248\n00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:30.350\nAnd we can keep on adding right here by\nme just typing in lists, which is really,\n\n249\n00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.870\nreally great.\n\n250\n00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.360\nAnd you can add and, whoops, I didn't\nwant that, just hit the Delete key.\n\n251\n00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:38.040\nAnd maybe I don't wanna talk about\ndogs anymore so I can select that and\n\n252\n00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:38.940\nthen delete that.\n\n253\n00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:44.110\nSo this is a really easy way to\nkinda control what the SmartArt\n\n254\n00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:49.070\nis doing just through our list view,\nwhich is very handy.\n\n255\n00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:53.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it seems like you can build the\nSmartArt fairly quickly to demonstrate or\n\n256\n00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.770\nto represent what you\nreally want it to do.\n\n257\n00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.760\nSo Vaughn, after we actually get to\nthis point where we know that we can\n\n258\n00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:03.040\ninsert in the SmartArt and even get our\ntext in there, what do we need to do next?\n\n259\n00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:08.100\n&gt;&gt; Well, I just kinda wanna show you\nsome other ways to get to the SmartArt.\n\n260\n00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.040\nSo why don't we go ahead and add a slide.\n\n261\n00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.618\nLet's go back into Home and we'll insert\na new slide of the title and content.\n\n262\n00:15:15.618 --> 00:15:19.863\nAnd I wanna go ahead and\nshow you how you can convert\n\n263\n00:15:19.863 --> 00:15:24.740\nan already existing text slide\ninto a SmartArt graphic.\n\n264\n00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.210\nAll right, so let's go ahead and say,\nConvert, just for fun for our title.\n\n265\n00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:35.350\nAnd then we're gonna say, I'm just gonna\ngo quick one, two, three, and four.\n\n266\n00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:40.000\nAnd then maybe, let's go ahead and\nadd some multi-level lists in there.\n\n267\n00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.040\nSo I'm just gonna hit, back off\nthe word two, I'm gonna hit Enter and\n\n268\n00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.620\nthe Tab to go ahead and\nindent that bullet.\n\n269\n00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:51.167\nAnd I'm just gonna say Sub 1 and\nSub 2 just to get some text in there.\n\n270\n00:15:51.167 --> 00:15:56.096\nSo say I have this as a slide already\nin my PowerPoint presentation, and\n\n271\n00:15:56.096 --> 00:15:59.968\nI just would like to make it look cooler,\nlook fancier.\n\n272\n00:15:59.968 --> 00:16:05.830\nSo with my cursor in the content\nplaceholder that I want.\n\n273\n00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:10.090\nOver here on our home tab we have\nconvert to smart art graphic.\n\n274\n00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:16.630\nAnd you can see that I have some\ndifferent ones that it shows by default.\n\n275\n00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:21.870\nAnd maybe since I'm doing multi-level\nlists, maybe this one might be nice.\n\n276\n00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.640\nJust to have fun,\nI'm gonna say that's great.\n\n277\n00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.170\nBut if these are not the ones that I\nwanted and I want something different, you\n\n278\n00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:32.770\ncan always go to more SmartArt graphics,\nand then it gives you the entire library.\n\n279\n00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:36.080\nSo, I could go into all sorts\nof different ones that I want.\n\n280\n00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.020\nMaybe I'll pick that one instead.\n\n281\n00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:42.940\nSo here you go, and then it just puts\nit right into that SmartArt graphic,\n\n282\n00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.850\nbrings you into your text view, or\nthe different ways you can add it.\n\n283\n00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:51.160\nSo I can go ahead and\ntab here just like I would in a list and\n\n284\n00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.280\nI could do Sub 1 here,\nSub 2 here, and so on and\n\n285\n00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.710\nso forth, and I'm just gonna keep on,\nSub 2, Sub 3.\n\n286\n00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:00.780\nOkay, there we go.\n\n287\n00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:05.720\n[LAUGH] And then you can come up here and\nif you wanted to change the layouts even\n\n288\n00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.585\nmore you can keep on going\nto your heart's content.\n\n289\n00:17:08.585 --> 00:17:12.050\nAnd I just find this so easy.\n\n290\n00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:17.190\nAnd the nice thing about SmartArt,\nif you just stay with what it does and\n\n291\n00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:21.470\nstay within the confines and\nthey're not really confines,\n\n292\n00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:25.790\nbecause it really allows you\nto be very flexible and easy.\n\n293\n00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:31.110\nJust keep it to what they are meant to\nbe and just use them and they're great.\n\n294\n00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:35.540\nThe nice thing about the SmartArt in\ncorrelation with your design themes\n\n295\n00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.770\nis that remember how design\nthemes will go ahead and\n\n296\n00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:39.810\ncontrol how the slides are laid out.\n\n297\n00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.940\nAnd maybe your title is below,\nversus on top.\n\n298\n00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.610\nIt's the same thing that will\nhappen when you apply design themes\n\n299\n00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:47.430\nin your SmartArts graphics.\n\n300\n00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:51.460\nThat will kinda determine how\nthe layouts will go from there too.\n\n301\n00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:56.240\nSo if you could see that\none where it's positioned,\n\n302\n00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.550\nversus this design,\nit's going to change what kinda shape.\n\n303\n00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.970\nSee, these are still the chevrons and\neverything,\n\n304\n00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:06.230\nbut where they're going to be\npositioned within the slides.\n\n305\n00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:11.870\nSo it determines all the same things\nthat you would have in a regular design.\n\n306\n00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:17.048\nIt does apply to the SmartArt graphic,\nwhich can be really nice.\n\n307\n00:18:17.048 --> 00:18:19.990\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, well that's a great\nway to actually display things like lists\n\n308\n00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:21.380\nin the way that you've shown us.\n\n309\n00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.000\nAre there any other parts of SmartArt\nthat we want to take a look at?\n\n310\n00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I actually have another example,\nI wanna do the organizational chart\n\n311\n00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.330\nbecause a lot of times when you're\ndoing presentations in a company,\n\n312\n00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:36.570\nyou might need to see that type of\nhierarchy of who does what, when, how.\n\n313\n00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.740\nSo why don't we go ahead and\nadd one of those.\n\n314\n00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.230\nI'm gonna come back into here and\nI'm gonna add another slide.\n\n315\n00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:44.520\nNow I'm just gonna take\na small little detour in\n\n316\n00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.900\nthe sense that I'm gonna\nadd a blank slide.\n\n317\n00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:52.220\nBecause we've been adding them from\nthe little button in the content area for\n\n318\n00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.910\nanswering SmartArt graphics.\n\n319\n00:18:53.910 --> 00:19:00.980\nBut you can always insert that by itself,\nas an object, from the insert tab.\n\n320\n00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:05.230\nAnd you can go into SmartArt, and\nyou can go ahead and click on that, and\n\n321\n00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:08.600\nthen get into the same library and\nchoose which one you want.\n\n322\n00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.220\nSo I'm gonna go with hierarchy and to keep\nit simple for now I'm just gonna use this\n\n323\n00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.470\nfirst one to use the organizational\nchart and I'm gonna click OK.\n\n324\n00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.940\nAnd then it goes ahead and adds it in.\n\n325\n00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:23.070\nAnd you can see that it gives me it in the\nshapes and the list view that I have over\n\n326\n00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:26.860\nthere on the left hand side for\nme to start adding our different people.\n\n327\n00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.230\nSo I'm gonna stay in the list for\nright now.\n\n328\n00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.300\nAnd we're gonna talk about,\nwell, who's the boss?\n\n329\n00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.630\nHere's the person who's at the top and\nthen all the people that are underneath.\n\n330\n00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:40.830\nSo, if I'm gonna go with the organization\nthat I know which is IT Pro TV.\n\n331\n00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:46.550\nSo we'll go with Tim,\nhe is our leader of our company and\n\n332\n00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:50.690\nthen you can see that it has added\nthis person off to the side.\n\n333\n00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.310\nNow notice that it's\nnot like a full indent,\n\n334\n00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.480\nit's like a what they call\nlike a line break, okay.\n\n335\n00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.100\nAnd this is where, this is the assistant.\n\n336\n00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:02.350\nOkay, so this is the assistant to\nthe owner or whoever who's on top.\n\n337\n00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.390\nNow, do you have to have an assistant?\n\n338\n00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:09.520\nNo, it's just adding that so\nyou can see that this is the level and\n\n339\n00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.580\nwhat it's going to look like\nwhen you add an assistant.\n\n340\n00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.760\nAnd when we get into adding and\nI think you know where I'm going.\n\n341\n00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.660\nIf I'm going to add shapes,\nlike those area and then come in.\n\n342\n00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.810\nYou at least know where it's gonna happen.\n\n343\n00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:22.270\nSo the assistant to Tim is Renee.\n\n344\n00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.450\nAnd so I could put that.\n\n345\n00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:25.690\nAnd then the next person.\n\n346\n00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:29.060\nSo let's say, well there's Denise, right?\n\n347\n00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.629\nSo she does our books.\n\n348\n00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.150\nAnd we have, we have Don, right?\n\n349\n00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:34.900\nNot done.\n\n350\n00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:35.917\nHe's not done, he's Don.\n\n351\n00:20:35.917 --> 00:20:40.010\n[LAUGH] So maybe, I know there's many\nmore people in our organization,\n\n352\n00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.390\nbut I'm just trying to go for\ndemonstration purposes.\n\n353\n00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.230\nBecause maybe we only have two\nother people underneath that.\n\n354\n00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:48.270\nWell you can go ahead and\njust delete that bullet.\n\n355\n00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:49.410\nWell then somebody is.\n\n356\n00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:50.340\nNope, that's not what we want.\n\n357\n00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.830\nSo we're going to go ahead and\ndelete one more time.\n\n358\n00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:57.550\nTo get to where I only have two people\nthat are underneath Tim with Renee being\n\n359\n00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:02.290\noff to the side as the assistant\nto that particular level.\n\n360\n00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:06.770\nSo, under Denise there are some of her\npeople that she works with in accounting.\n\n361\n00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:11.800\nAnd under Don he has some of\nthe hosts that he helps with\n\n362\n00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.574\norganizing all of our content.\n\n363\n00:21:13.574 --> 00:21:17.020\nSo I need to start adding\npeople below them.\n\n364\n00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.660\nWell, this is where you\ncould use your list view and\n\n365\n00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.150\nuse your indents, or your sub-lists.\n\n366\n00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:27.540\nSo, under Denise, if I hit enter, notice\nthat, with an enter, it's adding along\n\n367\n00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:33.130\nthe same level that if there is somebody\non this particular level, that's great.\n\n368\n00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:36.570\nBut I want it to be under so\nI hit the tab key and then you can\n\n369\n00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:41.950\nsee that that shape gets added under\nDenise and I can put, is it Stephanie?\n\n370\n00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:43.664\nI think that's her name.\n\n371\n00:21:43.664 --> 00:21:45.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Julie?\n\n372\n00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.580\n&gt;&gt; Julie?\nThere is Julie too, yes.\n\n373\n00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.270\nOkay, so we'll go with Julie.\n\n374\n00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.770\nAnd I know there is another one,\nI'm pretty sure her name is Stephanie, but\n\n375\n00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:53.732\nif I'm wrong I'm very sorry.\n\n376\n00:21:53.732 --> 00:21:58.180\n[LAUGH] But you can see that we've got two\npeople that are under Denise, right here.\n\n377\n00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:02.430\nAnd then there you go so I can use that\nlist view to go ahead and add that.\n\n378\n00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:05.840\nNow what if I need to\nadd people under Don?\n\n379\n00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.425\nWell let's go over to the shape view,\nrather than the list view.\n\n380\n00:22:09.425 --> 00:22:11.480\nTo go ahead and\ngive some other ways of doing this.\n\n381\n00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.110\nAnd I'm just gonna tuck that list back in\nby clicking on that little triangle or\n\n382\n00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:16.430\nI can click the x, either one.\n\n383\n00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.770\nIt will stay there it's not closing it,\nit's just collapsing it.\n\n384\n00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:24.670\nSo I'm gonna click on the shape\nthat I want to add a level to.\n\n385\n00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.870\nSo I'm on the dawn shape.\n\n386\n00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:30.150\nOver here on add shape you\ncould see I dropped this down.\n\n387\n00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.940\nAnd I can do the add shape above or\nbelow or\n\n388\n00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:38.495\nI can an assistant because may be Don\nhas an assistant that assists all of us.\n\n389\n00:22:38.495 --> 00:22:40.915\nSo you could always add\nit at this level as well,\n\n390\n00:22:40.915 --> 00:22:42.035\nit doesn't only have to be at the top.\n\n391\n00:22:42.035 --> 00:22:43.855\nIt could be at any level.\n\n392\n00:22:43.855 --> 00:22:47.675\nBut I'm adding below, so\nI'm gonna do add shape below,\n\n393\n00:22:47.675 --> 00:22:50.905\nand you can see that it's added it here.\n\n394\n00:22:50.905 --> 00:22:53.405\nAnd I could go ahead and put me, and\n\n395\n00:22:53.405 --> 00:22:56.240\nhow about we go ahead and\nthen add another one.\n\n396\n00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.670\nNow this is the one, if I added it below,\n\n397\n00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:05.400\nyou can see that it looks like it's going,\nDon then me then somebody else.\n\n398\n00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.820\nAnd I'm going to type in Ronnie.\n\n399\n00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.640\nYou know Ronnie I don't control you.\n\n400\n00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.460\nAnd any which ways we are equals.\n\n401\n00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.730\nSo this is where I wanted to\nshow you how you could take\n\n402\n00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:20.160\nsomebody in your organization and you\ncan either promote them or demote them.\n\n403\n00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:25.280\nBecause right now it seems like in the\nstructure that Ronnie would be under, but\n\n404\n00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.150\nhe's with me.\n\n405\n00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:30.150\nSo if I promote you can see that now in,\nand I'm gonna zoom in a little bit so that\n\n406\n00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:35.810\nyou can see that, you see that now Ronnie\nand I are on the same line off of Don.\n\n407\n00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:38.340\nNow, I could go ahead and\npromote Ronnie here.\n\n408\n00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.670\nAnd then you could be\nthe manager of awesomeness.\n\n409\n00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:41.299\nHow about that?\n\n410\n00:23:41.299 --> 00:23:43.446\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That would be my title.\n\n411\n00:23:43.446 --> 00:23:46.097\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, well, maybe we'll go ahead and\n\n412\n00:23:46.097 --> 00:23:47.009\ndemote you again.\n\n413\n00:23:47.009 --> 00:23:49.136\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not so awesome any more.\n\n414\n00:23:49.136 --> 00:23:50.852\n&gt;&gt; So we'll put you back down.\n\n415\n00:23:50.852 --> 00:23:56.290\nAnd you can see that this is our\nstructure within our organization.\n\n416\n00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:02.140\nPromoting, demoting people,\nyou can also move people down.\n\n417\n00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.779\nYou can see that I was on,\nme I wanted to be below Ronnie,\n\n418\n00:24:05.779 --> 00:24:07.953\njust within this like the order.\n\n419\n00:24:07.953 --> 00:24:10.326\nOr I can go ahead and move myself up.\n\n420\n00:24:10.326 --> 00:24:14.386\nSo you can move your shapes up and around,\n\n421\n00:24:14.386 --> 00:24:18.337\npromote, demote and so on and so forth.\n\n422\n00:24:18.337 --> 00:24:21.420\nAnd you can still go ahead and change\nall of your colors cuz I have to make\n\n423\n00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.620\nit colorful because it's just\nthat's just the way I like t do it.\n\n424\n00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.450\nBut notice in this particular org chart,\n\n425\n00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:32.470\nyou see how the lines off of Denise and\nDon, they both go the same way.\n\n426\n00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:38.350\nThey're called, which way does\nthe shapes hang off of that top level?\n\n427\n00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.470\nAnd they're both going to the right.\n\n428\n00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:43.240\nWhich, it's not that big of a deal,\nbut to me I don't know.\n\n429\n00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.600\nFor some reason I really wanna\nsee the lines on the other side.\n\n430\n00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.550\nNow you have to think of\nwhere they're hanging off of.\n\n431\n00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:55.240\nSo if I go back up to Denise,\nup here on my ribbon, on the layout,\n\n432\n00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:01.310\nyou could see that I have the different\nways of left hanging, or right hanging.\n\n433\n00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:03.790\nIt's more of a design thing for me.\n\n434\n00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.360\nI like to see it that way.\n\n435\n00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:11.820\nSo it kind of go off to the side and\nI can change the layout\n\n436\n00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:18.120\nof how the subordinates I'm gonna say are\nunderneath in this organizational chart.\n\n437\n00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.300\nI'm gonna go ahead back from my zoom.\n\n438\n00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.452\nAnd that's how you can add an org chart.\n\n439\n00:25:22.452 --> 00:25:26.466\nYou can take If I wanted\nto make this shape bigger,\n\n440\n00:25:26.466 --> 00:25:30.206\nI could make each shape\nindividually bigger.\n\n441\n00:25:30.206 --> 00:25:34.208\nOr I could make the entire SmartArt\ngraphic bigger, just like we had done with\n\n442\n00:25:34.208 --> 00:25:38.790\nany of other other episodes when we were\ndoing the shapes, they're all shapes.\n\n443\n00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:39.670\nThis is an object.\n\n444\n00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.278\nSo you can still do all the same things\nthat you could do with formatting\n\n445\n00:25:43.278 --> 00:25:44.760\nyour object individually.\n\n446\n00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:49.569\nFor example, if you wanted to take this\ntext and make it a different font,\n\n447\n00:25:49.569 --> 00:25:51.740\nyou can go ahead and do that.\n\n448\n00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.140\nI didn't want you to think that\nyou only had these options,\n\n449\n00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.800\nwhen using your smarter graphic,\nthey're just shapes.\n\n450\n00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.161\nSo you can pick out any piece,\ndo anything you want.\n\n451\n00:26:03.161 --> 00:26:07.837\nYou see, I wanna actually don't think\nwe've been gone to the format tab because\n\n452\n00:26:07.837 --> 00:26:12.444\nto me all the kind of preset designs and\nformats that SmartArt graphics give me,\n\n453\n00:26:12.444 --> 00:26:13.330\nI like them.\n\n454\n00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:18.190\nSo I usually don't go much further\nthan what the defaults give me.\n\n455\n00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:20.650\nBut just driving home that point of,\n\n456\n00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:23.360\nyou wanna put a drop shadow\non just this one piece?\n\n457\n00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.540\nGo right ahead.\n\n458\n00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:28.620\nOr maybe you want all of the texts\nin this to have all word art.\n\n459\n00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:33.010\nYou can click out to the whole piece,\nof the SmartArt graphic.\n\n460\n00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:36.840\nPut on, that's kind of hard to read,\nbut you can put out word styles.\n\n461\n00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:42.880\nSo, just showing you, you can do\nwhatever you want with your SmartArt.\n\n462\n00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.360\nI just tend to like to go with\nthe defaults cuz I think they look pretty.\n\n463\n00:26:47.718 --> 00:26:48.329\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n464\n00:26:48.329 --> 00:26:52.930\nVonne, well that's a lot of great\ninformation about the use of SmartArt.\n\n465\n00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.790\nRemember that when we actually do use\nSmartArt, we're normally using it for\n\n466\n00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:56.560\na purpose.\n\n467\n00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.070\nWe're really combining text\nas well as shapes together\n\n468\n00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.330\nto make sure that we get the information\nacross the way that we want to.\n\n469\n00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.453\nAnd most of us,\nwhen we first begin with PowerPoint,\n\n470\n00:27:04.453 --> 00:27:06.920\nwe're not thinking about\ncreating organizational charts.\n\n471\n00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.527\nBut here's an easy way to do so, without\nus having to add in every single element,\n\n472\n00:27:10.527 --> 00:27:12.694\nand actually puts it in\nthe order that we need to.\n\n473\n00:27:12.694 --> 00:27:16.209\nWhether it's a process, or\nwhether it's an organizational chart,\n\n474\n00:27:16.209 --> 00:27:20.453\nwhether we're trying to show a cyclic type\nof relationship, whatever it might be.\n\n475\n00:27:20.453 --> 00:27:24.201\nIt's certainly worth us taking the time to\nbuild use, because it means that we don't\n\n476\n00:27:24.201 --> 00:27:26.647\nhave to actually pick out\nevery element that we need to,\n\n477\n00:27:26.647 --> 00:27:30.080\nto get it ready to display,\ninside of our PowerPoint presentation.\n\n478\n00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.563\nThank you again Vonne, for helping us\nhere, and thank you also for watching.\n\n479\n00:27:33.563 --> 00:27:35.624\nBut it's a great place for us to sign off.\n\n480\n00:27:35.624 --> 00:27:38.478\nFor ITProTV I've been\nyour host Ronnie

help us out is gonna be,\nwell, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:28.759\nVonne, welcome back to our show.\n\n12\n00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:29.357\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n13\n00:00:29.357 --> 00:00:30.027\n&gt;&gt; How are you doing today?\n\n14\n00:00:30.027 --> 00:00:30.686\n&gt;&gt; I'm good.\n\n15\n00:00:30.686 --> 00:00:31.869\nI'm ready to table it up.\n\n16\n00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.673\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, so\n\n17\n00:00:33.673 --> 00:00:37.110\nlet's start with the obvious question\nabout the idea of using tables.\n\n18\n00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.030\nWhen in the world would we normally\nwant to use tables inside of\n\n19\n00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.558\nour PowerPoint presentation?\n\n20\n00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:45.852\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you have a lot of information\nthat maybe you want to compare and\n\n21\n00:00:45.852 --> 00:00:46.640\ncontrast and\n\n22\n00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.310\nyou wanna show it in a different format\nthan just listing it as bullet points.\n\n23\n00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.540\nOr maybe you have a whole paragraph,\n\n24\n00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.250\na whole section about one thing in\nthe section about another thing and\n\n25\n00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.930\nit's not really kind of giving\nthe message that you want.\n\n26\n00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.120\nYou could always organize\nthe information in tables.\n\n27\n00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.420\nAnd a table consists of rows and columns\nand where they intersect is a cell.\n\n28\n00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.280\nAnd you can go ahead and\nput the content into that cell and\n\n29\n00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.410\nbe able to see it as one piece.\n\n30\n00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.010\nThe nice thing is you could also\nmove it around as one element.\n\n31\n00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.803\nAnd it becomes its own, well, object\nwithin your PowerPoint presentation.\n\n32\n00:01:21.803 --> 00:01:25.507\nSo we could go ahead and get into it.\n\n33\n00:01:25.507 --> 00:01:29.619\nAnd I have a file that\nI created to just label\n\n34\n00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.284\nthe parts of a already created table.\n\n35\n00:01:33.284 --> 00:01:34.473\nSo you can hear and\n\n36\n00:01:34.473 --> 00:01:39.320\nsee some of the vocabulary that is\nassociated with working with a table.\n\n37\n00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.560\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\nre-create the table that we have.\n\n38\n00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.965\nSo I have a file in my PowerPoint\nfolder called Parts of a Table.\n\n39\n00:01:48.965 --> 00:01:51.156\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I almost forgot the name of the file.\n\n40\n00:01:51.156 --> 00:01:52.513\n[LAUGH] What are we doing?\n\n41\n00:01:52.513 --> 00:01:53.022\nWe're doing a table.\n\n42\n00:01:53.022 --> 00:01:54.730\nAll right, so here we go.\n\n43\n00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.500\nParts of a Table.\n\n44\n00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.940\nI tried to go with why are things labeled\nin blue and why are some labeled in green?\n\n45\n00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.651\nThe reason I went with that is ones are\nmore formating versus actual vocabulary,\n\n46\n00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:10.851\nif you wanna say,\nabout the different parts of a cell.\n\n47\n00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:13.706\nSo you could see that we have the rows,\nokay?\n\n48\n00:02:13.706 --> 00:02:16.185\nA row would be across.\n\n49\n00:02:16.185 --> 00:02:17.239\nOo, now I'm just crossing it out.\n\n50\n00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.316\n[LAUGH And then you have our columns.\n\n51\n00:02:19.316 --> 00:02:21.836\nSo columns go up and down, rows go across.\n\n52\n00:02:21.836 --> 00:02:25.453\nAnd so you can go ahead and\nsee that where a row and\n\n53\n00:02:25.453 --> 00:02:28.725\na column intersect, that would be a cell.\n\n54\n00:02:28.725 --> 00:02:31.910\nSo, each one of these things,\nwe can call them,\n\n55\n00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.192\nthey are cells that you\ninput the information in.\n\n56\n00:02:35.192 --> 00:02:36.157\nNow, this particular table,\nacross the top,\n\n57\n00:02:36.157 --> 00:02:37.750\nyou notice how there aren't any divide\nlines between these cells is because we\n\n58\n00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.051\nactually took a group of cells and\nwe merged them into one cell.\n\n59\n00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:42.068\nSo a merged cell,\n\n60\n00:02:42.068 --> 00:02:47.901\nwe'll be taking a couple of them,\n\n61\n00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:52.125\neither across or down and\n\n62\n00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:57.969\ncreating one large cell out of it.\n\n63\n00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:03.200\nAnd this particular one here,\ntotal row, why did I add this?\n\n64\n00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.642\nBecause this is where it looks like,\nthat's where you always put totals,\n\n65\n00:03:07.642 --> 00:03:09.050\nit's not necessarily.\n\n66\n00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.215\nI think the way they name it\ncan be a little misleading.\n\n67\n00:03:12.215 --> 00:03:15.587\nBut normally,\nif you have numbers like this,\n\n68\n00:03:15.587 --> 00:03:18.793\nyou would maybe total\nthem up at the bottom.\n\n69\n00:03:18.793 --> 00:03:22.025\nBut it doesn't have to be totaled numbers.\n\n70\n00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:26.345\nIt's really just how PowerPoint,\nI almost said Excel.\n\n71\n00:03:26.345 --> 00:03:26.872\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n72\n00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:29.340\n&gt;&gt; Because Excel,\nyou use tables Excel as well.\n\n73\n00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.293\nBut it's a way that PowerPoint\njust formats that particular last\n\n74\n00:03:34.293 --> 00:03:37.544\nrow in the way that it's using the styles.\n\n75\n00:03:37.544 --> 00:03:42.413\nCuz we've been doing a lot of things with\nstyles throughout our different episodes,\n\n76\n00:03:42.413 --> 00:03:46.876\nwith our smart art graphics and our shapes\nand our pictures So if you say, yes,\n\n77\n00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:50.795\nI want to format this last row as\na total row when you apply the styles,\n\n78\n00:03:50.795 --> 00:03:53.735\nit will go ahead and\ndo that different formatting.\n\n79\n00:03:53.735 --> 00:03:58.683\nBecause I did apply this\nstyle to this table,\n\n80\n00:03:58.683 --> 00:04:03.120\nthat went ahead and did the banded rows.\n\n81\n00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.202\nYou can see that each row has a different\ncolor, like dark, light, dark, light.\n\n82\n00:04:07.202 --> 00:04:10.679\nWhy would you want to do that?\n\n83\n00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:11.879\nIt's cuz it's a little easier to read,\n\n84\n00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.234\nespecially if you have\na lot of information.\n\n85\n00:04:13.234 --> 00:04:16.582\nNow in a PowerPoint,\nyou don't wanna get bigger than the slide.\n\n86\n00:04:16.582 --> 00:04:21.562\nBut if I had ten or twelve rows in here,\nit's easier to differentiate if\n\n87\n00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:26.780\nyou have just a little bit of color\ndifferentiation in between your rows.\n\n88\n00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.750\nSo that's an example of banded rows\nwith this particular style that I chose.\n\n89\n00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.880\nAnd then you also have how wide\neach one of these columns and\n\n90\n00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.240\nhow wide, actually the other way, when\ntalking about rows, that would be heights.\n\n91\n00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.204\nSo widths and heights of\nthe different pieces of our table.\n\n92\n00:04:46.204 --> 00:04:48.061\nAnd you can change them.\n\n93\n00:04:48.061 --> 00:04:52.691\nYou can see how this row is higher than\nsome of the other rows that are in this\n\n94\n00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:53.219\ntable.\n\n95\n00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:57.347\nAnd then, of course,\nyou could take the entire table and\n\n96\n00:04:57.347 --> 00:05:00.885\nresize that as well because\nit's all one piece.\n\n97\n00:05:00.885 --> 00:05:04.572\nNow how do I get Into these\ndifferent pieces of the table?\n\n98\n00:05:04.572 --> 00:05:10.474\nBecause maybe I want to change\nthe row height or the column width or\n\n99\n00:05:10.474 --> 00:05:15.214\nselect a row to be able to\nformat this with bold text.\n\n100\n00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:19.716\nHow to select things within\na table is really important, and\n\n101\n00:05:19.716 --> 00:05:22.989\nit all comes down to\nyour mouse cursor icon.\n\n102\n00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:26.166\nWhat does that mouse cursor look\nlike when you're over something?\n\n103\n00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:27.825\nAnd in a table,\nyou actually have a lot of them.\n\n104\n00:05:27.825 --> 00:05:30.701\nSo let me show you a few of them,\nand I'm just gonna be hovering.\n\n105\n00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:35.473\nI'm gonna try to go ahead and\nzoom in so you can see this little bit.\n\n106\n00:05:35.473 --> 00:05:40.108\nYou see if I'm hovering above with\nthis black arrow pointing down, if you\n\n107\n00:05:40.108 --> 00:05:45.063\nclicked right now, that would indicate\nthat you would be selecting a column.\n\n108\n00:05:45.063 --> 00:05:47.195\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and do it just so\n\n109\n00:05:47.195 --> 00:05:50.405\nyou can see that it has selected\nthat particular column.\n\n110\n00:05:50.405 --> 00:05:52.743\nAnd I'm just gonna click\noff to deselect that.\n\n111\n00:05:52.743 --> 00:05:54.700\nLet's go back in here.\n\n112\n00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.730\nIf I'm over too, there we go,\nhad to get close enough to it.\n\n113\n00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.850\nI'm like, where is it?\n\n114\n00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.301\nIf I get close enough to it, the arrow\npointing to the right would indicate that\n\n115\n00:06:04.301 --> 00:06:06.201\nI would select an entire column.\n\n116\n00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:13.139\nBut do you see how if I go right about\nhere, the arrow turns to a diagonal?\n\n117\n00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.273\nAnd when you see that diagonal,\n\n118\n00:06:15.273 --> 00:06:19.711\nthat means you'd be selecting\nthe entire cell, not the eye beam.\n\n119\n00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:23.454\nThe eye beam means you'd\nbe selecting the text.\n\n120\n00:06:23.454 --> 00:06:28.861\nSo select the text versus select\nthe cell versus select the row,\n\n121\n00:06:28.861 --> 00:06:31.378\nall within a very small area.\n\n122\n00:06:31.378 --> 00:06:33.906\nAnd you might've seen\na couple more that popped in.\n\n123\n00:06:33.906 --> 00:06:38.592\nDo you see where if I get right about\nthere, it's not exactly over it cuz I'm\n\n124\n00:06:38.592 --> 00:06:43.224\nzoomed in, but there's two lines with\narrows pointing off the side of it?\n\n125\n00:06:43.224 --> 00:06:48.025\nThat means that I could change\nthe column width, okay.\n\n126\n00:06:48.025 --> 00:06:53.009\nSo I can move that column left or\n\n127\n00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:58.967\nright to be able to change that size.\n\n128\n00:06:58.967 --> 00:06:59.987\nIf I come down here,\ntwo lines with arrows on tops and bottoms,\n\n129\n00:06:59.987 --> 00:07:00.676\nthen you'd get changing the row height.\n\n130\n00:07:00.676 --> 00:07:03.065\nLots of different things all\nright around a small area.\n\n131\n00:07:03.065 --> 00:07:07.113\nKnow what your mouse cursor\nlooks before you click it,\n\n132\n00:07:07.113 --> 00:07:10.107\ncuz that's what it's gonna do, okay?\n\n133\n00:07:10.107 --> 00:07:13.370\nSo definitely wanted to point\nthat out cuz it's very important.\n\n134\n00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.020\nI think people get very confused,\n\n135\n00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.670\nvery quickly of like,\nit's not doing what I want it to do.\n\n136\n00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.235\nGotta watch the mouse.\n\n137\n00:07:20.235 --> 00:07:25.457\nSo be very, very careful about\nwatching your mouse cursor icons.\n\n138\n00:07:25.457 --> 00:07:28.281\nAnd of course,\nonce you have things selected,\n\n139\n00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.334\nyou have your two pointed arrows.\n\n140\n00:07:30.334 --> 00:07:33.519\nAnd that's where if I wanted to\nresize that entire table, and\n\n141\n00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:35.119\nI'll just do it really quick.\n\n142\n00:07:35.119 --> 00:07:40.091\nIt's gonna throw off all my arrows and\neverything, but I can resize the entire,\n\n143\n00:07:40.091 --> 00:07:42.667\nI could go ahead and get the column width.\n\n144\n00:07:42.667 --> 00:07:45.023\nThat would be, yes, I did the width,\nokay, [LAUGH] height.\n\n145\n00:07:45.023 --> 00:07:50.075\nI sometimes throw that width and\nheight around, but you can see that it's\n\n146\n00:07:50.075 --> 00:07:54.985\ngonna go ahead and start changing all\nthe different pieces of my table.\n\n147\n00:07:54.985 --> 00:07:58.057\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, when we start to take\na look at the overall notion of\n\n148\n00:07:58.057 --> 00:08:01.721\nwhat you're trying to do with the table\nthere You're comparing, well,\n\n149\n00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:05.881\nyou're actually showing us two different\nthings that we're comparing, right?\n\n150\n00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:09.897\nWe're taking a look at your cats,\nFuego, and-\n\n151\n00:08:09.897 --> 00:08:10.508\n&gt;&gt; Bishop.\n\n152\n00:08:10.508 --> 00:08:15.344\n&gt;&gt; Bishop, and\none of them apparently sleeps or eats for\n\n153\n00:08:15.344 --> 00:08:17.394\nsix hours a [LAUGH] day.\n\n154\n00:08:17.394 --> 00:08:22.066\nThat's pretty hefty there overall, but\ncompared to Bishop apparently three times\n\n155\n00:08:22.066 --> 00:08:25.365\nas much as Bishop and\nyou might wonder why it's important.\n\n156\n00:08:25.365 --> 00:08:28.150\nRemember that PowerPoints\nare about presentation right?\n\n157\n00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.880\nThe information that you want to display\nhere has to be displayed in an orderly\n\n158\n00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.710\nmanner and has to make sense to\nwhoever's going to be looking at it.\n\n159\n00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.880\nIt would do no good for\nus just to display random information so\n\n160\n00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.890\nwhat Yvonne has done here is showing\nus a comparison of cat activity,\n\n161\n00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.345\nwhich I didn't know that there\nwas such a thing as cat activity.\n\n162\n00:08:45.345 --> 00:08:46.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To tell you the truth,\n\n163\n00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.285\nmine sleeps and I don't know about play,\ncuz I'm never home.\n\n164\n00:08:50.285 --> 00:08:52.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But sleeps and\n\n165\n00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.430\neats are the two that I know about.\n\n166\n00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:58.915\nBut the very fact that your cat\nactually eats for six hours a day.\n\n167\n00:08:58.915 --> 00:09:02.170\nI would say indicates\nmaybe a visit to the vet.\n\n168\n00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.335\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well we actually have had the vet\n\n169\n00:09:05.335 --> 00:09:06.720\ntry to put Fuego on a diet.\n\n170\n00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.250\n&gt;&gt; No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n171\n00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.230\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cuz Fuego is about twice or\n\n172\n00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.900\nat least three times the size of Bishop.\n\n173\n00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.180\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if he really eats for\n\n174\n00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.425\nsix hours a day.\n\n175\n00:09:15.425 --> 00:09:17.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was gonna say,\nyou did this study.\n\n176\n00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.662\nThat's kind of-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n177\n00:09:17.662 --> 00:09:19.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Amazing, the comparison there.\n\n178\n00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.980\nBut overall though, just kind of\nthink about that type of information.\n\n179\n00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.080\nSo when you want to do a comparison,\na table's a great way to do this.\n\n180\n00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.560\nBut normally, if we were to do this\nwithout a table, right, Yvonne?\n\n181\n00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.380\nWe'd put, probably,\nFuego on one slide, and\n\n182\n00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.070\nthen talk about everything that Fuego\ndoes and then, on a separate slide,\n\n183\n00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:40.280\nwe would put Bishop and instead now\nwe can see very condensed at this\n\n184\n00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.970\npoint where now she can actually compare\nboth of them and that way you know hey,\n\n185\n00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.965\nhere it is and Yvonne's making a decision\non which one to cut, no not really.\n\n186\n00:09:47.965 --> 00:09:48.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Making us,\n\n187\n00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.300\njust trying to see the activity here.\n\n188\n00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.390\nIt really does make\nthe point that we need to.\n\n189\n00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.710\nBut the way that we do is by all the tools\nthat Yvonne's been talking about, and\n\n190\n00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.630\nhow we adjust it, how we format,\nhow we do those things and\n\n191\n00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.190\nit's gonna really help us out in the end.\n\n192\n00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.730\nAll right, so Yvonne, now that we\nunderstand some of the different parts,\n\n193\n00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.240\nare we gonna build a table now and\nsee what we're gonna do?\n\n194\n00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:14.190\n&gt;&gt; We are, we're going to recreate and\nbe able to show that, yes Bishop\n\n195\n00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:20.160\nlikes to play and talk a lot, and\nFuego likes to eat a lot and sleep a lot.\n\n196\n00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.970\nSo why don't we go ahead and\nadd a new slide.\n\n197\n00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:29.020\nNow you can go ahead and add a title and\ncontent and it will have that click\n\n198\n00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:32.680\nbutton, just like we had with adding our\nSmartArt graphics or inserting a picture.\n\n199\n00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.820\nThere's a button right\nthere to insert a table.\n\n200\n00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.140\nSo we could totally go ahead and\ndo it that way, or\n\n201\n00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:42.860\nif you wanted to add a blank slide, and\nthen insert the table as an object here,\n\n202\n00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.330\nyou can always go ahead and Insert Table.\n\n203\n00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.380\nThere it is.\nI was like, where?\n\n204\n00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.660\nI forgot, it's on the left-hand side.\n\n205\n00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.080\nSo you can insert a table that way.\n\n206\n00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.131\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ndo the title and content,\n\n207\n00:10:52.131 --> 00:10:56.984\nand then go ahead and click on the little\nbutton right there for insert table.\n\n208\n00:10:56.984 --> 00:11:01.850\nNow when I click on this, it's going to\ndefault to how many columns you want and\n\n209\n00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:02.820\nhow many rows.\n\n210\n00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.180\nWell, maybe you don't know, because back\non that other slide, here let me just go\n\n211\n00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.540\nahead and click cancel or the escape key,\nand see I have, it looks like one,\n\n212\n00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:16.450\ntwo, three, four, five, six, seven,\nI had seven rows and three columns.\n\n213\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.600\nWell if I knew that much ahead\nof time I could go ahead and\n\n214\n00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.518\ntype that in, be able to go with that, but\n\n215\n00:11:20.518 --> 00:11:25.040\nI'm gonna purposely not do it that\nway to show you how we can add and\n\n216\n00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:30.490\ndelete our rows and columns in case you\nare on the fly building your table.\n\n217\n00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.630\nSo let's go ahead, [COUGH] excuse me,\nand back to that table.\n\n218\n00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.170\nInsert columns and rows.\n\n219\n00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.224\nWell, that sounds good.\n\n220\n00:11:37.224 --> 00:11:42.632\nI'll just click OK, and\nit goes ahead and adds in this table,\n\n221\n00:11:42.632 --> 00:11:47.832\nright away in our five columns and\nour two rows, and it gives\n\n222\n00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:54.502\nus our contextual tab on our ribbon to\nstart designing a layout of our table.\n\n223\n00:11:54.502 --> 00:12:00.209\nAll right, now I'm gonna go ahead and put\nit into a different style right away cuz I\n\n224\n00:12:00.209 --> 00:12:05.846\nwanna be able to show you the content and\nnot get kind of distracted by the colors.\n\n225\n00:12:05.846 --> 00:12:10.170\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ngo back to just like a no style,\n\n226\n00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:13.320\nit's just in a regular grid formation.\n\n227\n00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.440\nSo that way they can really concentrate\non just getting the information in and\n\n228\n00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.170\nget the basic structure of it.\n\n229\n00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.640\nBut you can see really easy to apply,\n\n230\n00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.240\nreally quick formats in the style\nright there in our design tab.\n\n231\n00:12:26.375 --> 00:12:32.455\nAll right, well I want to not have\nfive columns and I need more rows.\n\n232\n00:12:32.455 --> 00:12:34.415\nSo I'm gonna click in a column.\n\n233\n00:12:34.415 --> 00:12:35.785\nSo I'm just clicking my cursor,\n\n234\n00:12:35.785 --> 00:12:39.436\nI can get a flashing I-beam\nin that column right there.\n\n235\n00:12:40.657 --> 00:12:41.797\nHow can I delete that?\n\n236\n00:12:41.797 --> 00:12:43.587\nThere's a couple ways.\n\n237\n00:12:43.587 --> 00:12:44.947\nI do like right-clicking.\n\n238\n00:12:44.947 --> 00:12:48.897\nSo what I'm looking for in this\nright-click is how to delete this column,\n\n239\n00:12:48.897 --> 00:12:52.990\nbut notice it's not really in\nthis first list right here.\n\n240\n00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.630\nIt is in what's known as the mini tool bar\nand that's up here, so you can see I've\n\n241\n00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.554\ngot delete and there's a little drop\ndown next to that, and I click it.\n\n242\n00:13:01.554 --> 00:13:04.630\nIt's actually you don't have to be either\nto the right or if you just click right on\n\n243\n00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.930\nthe button, and you can see that\nI want to delete that column.\n\n244\n00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.220\nI don't want the row I don't want\nthe table, delete the column, and\n\n245\n00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:16.565\nthat is how I can delete that column\nby right-clicking on the cell and\n\n246\n00:13:16.565 --> 00:13:21.870\nbe able to say, because your cursor is\nin that cell, which does have a column,\n\n247\n00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.790\nand a row, you're saying,\ndelete the column where I'm at right now.\n\n248\n00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.650\nSo, that's one way you could do it.\n\n249\n00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.030\nAnother way you could do\nit is through the ribbon.\n\n250\n00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.320\nAll right, so,\nI'm gonna back to the same thing.\n\n251\n00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.410\nI need three columns.\n\n252\n00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.560\nSo, I've got this fourth column,\nand I want that to go away,\n\n253\n00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.550\nso I put my cursor In that cell.\n\n254\n00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:44.980\nI come up to the Layout tab on the table\ntools, and then I can come over here,\n\n255\n00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:45.990\nit's the same icon, right?\n\n256\n00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:48.690\nSo I can delete, delete what?\n\n257\n00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.490\nI want to delete a column and so\n\n258\n00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:56.605\nnow I have a table with three columns and\ntwo rows, great.\n\n259\n00:13:56.605 --> 00:13:59.235\nWell, what if I wanted to add another row,\n\n260\n00:13:59.235 --> 00:14:02.465\nbecause I know I'm gonna have\na couple more rows that I need?\n\n261\n00:14:02.465 --> 00:14:03.825\nYou can do the same thing.\n\n262\n00:14:03.825 --> 00:14:09.035\nPut your cursor into a cell\nthat you want to insert a row,\n\n263\n00:14:09.035 --> 00:14:11.995\nand then you have to determine, do you\nwant the row above where you're at or\n\n264\n00:14:11.995 --> 00:14:16.580\ndo you want the row to go\nbelow where you're at?\n\n265\n00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:21.120\nSo you can see, over here on the ribbon,\nyou have insert above or\n\n266\n00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.972\nyou can insert below.\n\n267\n00:14:22.972 --> 00:14:24.747\nI'm gonna go ahead and insert,\n\n268\n00:14:24.747 --> 00:14:28.312\nand the same way that you can insert\na row you can insert a column.\n\n269\n00:14:28.312 --> 00:14:31.760\nSo if I wanted to add another column for\nsome whatever reason I can go ahead,\n\n270\n00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.807\ndo I want a column to the left or\nto the right?\n\n271\n00:14:33.807 --> 00:14:36.073\nBecause maybe it went ahead and\ntyped all the information,\n\n272\n00:14:36.073 --> 00:14:39.347\nwhich we're gonna do in a little bit, and\nyou realized there's a third cat, right?\n\n273\n00:14:39.347 --> 00:14:44.232\nThere's Pumpkin that you need to add\nanother, so you could say, well do I want\n\n274\n00:14:44.232 --> 00:14:48.894\nPumpkin to go in between Fuego or Bishop,\nor do you want it to go to the left or\n\n275\n00:14:48.894 --> 00:14:53.853\nto the right, whichever way you want to\ngo you can see how it's really quite easy\n\n276\n00:14:53.853 --> 00:14:58.441\nto insert or delete rows or columns,\nand you could also do the same thing by\n\n277\n00:14:58.441 --> 00:15:03.291\nright-clicking the same way right there,\nand you could insert a row below.\n\n278\n00:15:03.291 --> 00:15:07.744\nAnd so now I've got four rows, yes,\nfour rows, [LAUGH] three columns,\n\n279\n00:15:07.744 --> 00:15:11.753\nand why don't we go ahead and\nstart putting in text into the table\n\n280\n00:15:11.753 --> 00:15:16.061\nto get some content and then will\njust start changing things around,\n\n281\n00:15:16.061 --> 00:15:18.837\nand changing sizes and\nalso some fun stuff.\n\n282\n00:15:18.837 --> 00:15:23.970\nSo, let's go ahead and talk about,\nwhat we are comparing?\n\n283\n00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:28.631\nWell we wanna put our column headers,\nso were gonna type in activity,\n\n284\n00:15:28.631 --> 00:15:30.620\nthat we're going to do.\n\n285\n00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.970\nNow, I wanna get to\nthe next cell to the right.\n\n286\n00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:35.410\nYou could click your mouse.\n\n287\n00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:39.130\nYou could just click your mouse and click\nit, cuz that's what a lot of people do,\n\n288\n00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.610\nand we'll just go ahead and say Fuego.\n\n289\n00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:46.850\nBut an easy way to get to the next column\nis to hit the tab key on your keyboard.\n\n290\n00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:50.230\nIf you hit the tab, it automatically\ntakes you over to the next column.\n\n291\n00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.970\nSo if you're used to Excel,\nsame concept here.\n\n292\n00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.190\nSo we're going to go ahead and\nthen add in Bishop.\n\n293\n00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.751\nInto here, now,\nI need to get down to the next row.\n\n294\n00:15:58.751 --> 00:16:00.281\nWell, if you're a Word person,\n\n295\n00:16:00.281 --> 00:16:02.750\nyou're probably used to\nhitting Enter to move down.\n\n296\n00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:05.228\nWell, if you hit Enter within a table.\n\n297\n00:16:05.228 --> 00:16:08.251\nYou're actually creating a character turn,\n\n298\n00:16:08.251 --> 00:16:12.989\nor a paragraph within that cell and\nthat's not what you really wanna do.\n\n299\n00:16:12.989 --> 00:16:16.947\nSo I'm going to hit the backspace\nkey to get rid of that and\n\n300\n00:16:16.947 --> 00:16:21.647\nif you hit the tab key at the end\nof your row, that'll automatically\n\n301\n00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:26.538\ncycle you to the beginning of the next\nrow which is pretty handy there.\n\n302\n00:16:26.538 --> 00:16:29.490\nSo I was like yep just follow along,\nand then I could go ahead and\n\n303\n00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:31.400\nstart typing in the information I want.\n\n304\n00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:36.390\nSo we said that our first activity is\nsleeping because well, cats sleep a lot,\n\n305\n00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:40.290\nand in the amount,\nI think I said 16 and Bishop was 12?\n\n306\n00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:41.540\n&gt;&gt; I think.\n\n307\n00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.109\n&gt;&gt; We'll go with that.\n\n308\n00:16:42.109 --> 00:16:43.363\nWe can move on the fly.\n\n309\n00:16:43.363 --> 00:16:44.767\n&gt;&gt; As long as it adds up to 24 we're okay.\n\n310\n00:16:44.767 --> 00:16:45.548\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n311\n00:16:45.548 --> 00:16:49.940\nand I'm gonna make sure you check on\nmy math for this one there Ronnie.\n\n312\n00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.090\nAll right.\nSo I'm just hitting the tab key and\n\n313\n00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:57.710\nthen the next one was eat and\nFuego ate a lot, and Bishop didn't.\n\n314\n00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.770\nAll right, they also like to play and\n\n315\n00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:05.200\nFuego doesn't like to play\na lot cuz he's kind of a lay\n\n316\n00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.130\naround type of cat and Bishop,\nhe plays a lot, so we'll go with four.\n\n317\n00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.408\nI'm making up numbers again, so.\n\n318\n00:17:11.408 --> 00:17:14.879\nSorry.\nI went too fast because I didn't tell you,\n\n319\n00:17:14.879 --> 00:17:17.712\nwell how did I just make another row?\n\n320\n00:17:17.712 --> 00:17:21.757\nBecause the nice thing is, when you're\nadding information into a table and\n\n321\n00:17:21.757 --> 00:17:25.986\nyou get to the end, the last row, and\nI want to make another row automatically,\n\n322\n00:17:25.986 --> 00:17:29.266\njust hit the tab key again, and\nit cycles you to the next row and\n\n323\n00:17:29.266 --> 00:17:30.750\nmakes another row as well.\n\n324\n00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:31.360\nWhich is really nice.\n\n325\n00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.110\nInstead of having to go up to the top and\n\n326\n00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:37.980\ninsert a row below, just hit the tab\nkey as you're typing in, and so\n\n327\n00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.450\nwe went ahead, and said meow,\ncuz Fuego's kind of a talker.\n\n328\n00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:45.420\nOkay, here's my math, 16, six, and one,\nhow many do we have left there, Ronnie?\n\n329\n00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.070\n&gt;&gt; One?\n\n330\n00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.610\n&gt;&gt; One.\nAll right, perfect.\n\n331\n00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.335\nI trust you.\n\n332\n00:17:50.335 --> 00:17:54.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And with Bishop, we've got 6, 12,\n\n333\n00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.900\n18, that's a lot!\n\n334\n00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:57.400\n24, 6.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n335\n00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:57.900\n&gt;&gt; Is that right?\n\n336\n00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.466\nOkay perfect!\n\n337\n00:17:58.466 --> 00:18:00.787\n[LAUGH] Well he is a talker.\n\n338\n00:18:00.787 --> 00:18:02.557\n[LAUGH] So we'll go with that, and\n\n339\n00:18:02.557 --> 00:18:06.730\nthen I need another row, so I'm just\ngoing to hit Enter and then I'm I'm gonna\n\n340\n00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:10.705\ntype in total, and now we have 24 and 24.\nIt doesn't have the equations and\n\n341\n00:18:10.705 --> 00:18:13.698\neverything like Excel does,\nwhere you could do your auto sum, and\n\n342\n00:18:13.698 --> 00:18:16.960\nautomatically calculate.\nIt's not as fancy as that, so\n\n343\n00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.733\nyou will have to be inserting\nthe information manually,\n\n344\n00:18:20.733 --> 00:18:25.840\nrather than doing some of that fun stuff\nthat you can do in a Formulas in Excel,\n\n345\n00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.195\nstuff like that.\nSo we've got all our information that we\n\n346\n00:18:29.195 --> 00:18:33.234\nwant into our table, and so now I\nthink it's ready to start formatting.\n\n347\n00:18:33.234 --> 00:18:33.980\n&gt;&gt; Well Yvonne,\n\n348\n00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.160\nwe're missing something, aren't we?\n\n349\n00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.340\nDidn't you have CAD\nactivity across the top?\n\n350\n00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.860\nAre we actually just adding in another\nrow, that would create three columns?\n\n351\n00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.678\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so why won't we show\nthem how to merge some cells.\n\n352\n00:18:44.678 --> 00:18:48.740\nAll right, so same thing I gotta\nmake sure I'm in the column or\n\n353\n00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.890\nrow that I need to be in\nto start adding something.\n\n354\n00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.400\nSo, I'm gonna click in activity, and\n\n355\n00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:59.330\nI'm going to insert above and you\nare correct, anytime that I insert a row,\n\n356\n00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.900\nit's gonna automatically divide\ninto the columns like I want it to.\n\n357\n00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:07.400\nSo I want to then say no, I want this to\nbe one whole cell, all the way across.\n\n358\n00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.630\nWe're gonna merge our cells.\n\n359\n00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:14.590\nNow it's automatically selected for\nme once I inserted a row above,\n\n360\n00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:18.730\nbut I wanted to just show you how I could\nselect those cells if I hadn't done that.\n\n361\n00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:23.341\nYou can click, hold, and drag like you\nwere selecting text in a paragraph or\n\n362\n00:19:23.341 --> 00:19:27.520\nthe little arrow that I\nshowed you to go ahead and\n\n363\n00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:32.540\nselect the entire row across, to say,\nI want all of these selected cells\n\n364\n00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:37.010\nto become one big cell, and that's\nwhere you can click on the Layout tab.\n\n365\n00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.188\nYou can hit the Merge Cells button.\n\n366\n00:19:39.188 --> 00:19:42.763\nYou can right-click as well\nas to find that there, but\n\n367\n00:19:42.763 --> 00:19:46.805\nI'm just gonna stay on this ribbon and\nsay Merge As Cells, and\n\n368\n00:19:46.805 --> 00:19:51.470\nyou can see that now I've got one big\ncell across multiple columns, and\n\n369\n00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:56.210\nthen I could go ahead and type in cat\nactivity and then I have my table, and\n\n370\n00:19:56.210 --> 00:20:01.618\nthen the rest of it is really just let's\ngo ahead and start formatting all of this.\n\n371\n00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:05.575\nIt's kind of in a the wrong-\n&gt;&gt; Place\n\n372\n00:20:05.575 --> 00:20:07.130\n&gt;&gt; Place thank you [LAUGH],\n\n373\n00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:10.332\nspace place within the slide so\nI want to move it.\n\n374\n00:20:10.332 --> 00:20:14.172\nSo as long as I get that four pointed\narrows on the edge, cuz I want to take\n\n375\n00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:17.580\nthe whole piece, I could go ahead and\nmove this to where I want.\n\n376\n00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.720\nWe've got those auto align\nfeatures that I love so much.\n\n377\n00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.520\nMaybe I want to make this overall bigger.\n\n378\n00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:29.050\nI like all the relationships with\nhow wide the columns are right now.\n\n379\n00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:31.490\nSo maybe I'll go ahead and\njust expand this out.\n\n380\n00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:32.760\nI grab a corner.\n\n381\n00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.183\nAutomatically makes everything\na little bit bigger.\n\n382\n00:20:36.183 --> 00:20:41.025\nI could also change the width and\nheights of the rows and columns.\n\n383\n00:20:41.025 --> 00:20:44.202\nSo I could take those two\nlines with the arrows and\n\n384\n00:20:44.202 --> 00:20:49.237\nI can pull this down a little bit to be\nable to make cat activity a little wider,\n\n385\n00:20:49.237 --> 00:20:53.965\nno that would be higher [LAUGH], and\nmaybe I want to make some of the columns\n\n386\n00:20:53.965 --> 00:20:57.867\na little bit less wide, so\nI'll go ahead and shorten this.\n\n387\n00:20:57.867 --> 00:21:01.562\nI get those two pointed arrows and\nthen I can just drag that over,\n\n388\n00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:04.010\nand then I could go ahead and align this.\n\n389\n00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:08.130\nI could also come out here and make,\nthat's going back to the overall\n\n390\n00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.730\ntable sorry, I wanna make sure\ni can get that there we go.\n\n391\n00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:15.960\nRight there [LAUGH], and I could go ahead\nand extend out the size of that column.\n\n392\n00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.570\nSo I just undid that because\nI didn't want to keep that.\n\n393\n00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:20.740\nSo you can go ahead and\n\n394\n00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:24.960\nmodify any of those different elements\nthat you want within your table.\n\n395\n00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.310\nBut it looks kind of bland,\nand I could go through and\n\n396\n00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:32.940\nformat every single cell differently, but\nthat's what we got our styles for right?\n\n397\n00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:37.220\nSo I'm going to go back over to our\nDesign tab, and I'm gonna drop this down.\n\n398\n00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:41.210\nThe color schemes of course,\nare with the design theme overall so\n\n399\n00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:45.170\nif you're in a different theme, you're\ngonna get a different selections of colors\n\n400\n00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.952\nand you can see that there's\nones that format the entire,\n\n401\n00:21:47.952 --> 00:21:51.340\nlike the color, it fills in all the cells.\n\n402\n00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.880\nI tend to not like those.\n\n403\n00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.130\nI always go for one's like this,\nI don't know why.\n\n404\n00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:59.400\nThat's where my eye goes to.\n\n405\n00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.891\nI do like blue, maybe I'll go with green\njust to mix it up a little bit, and\n\n406\n00:22:03.891 --> 00:22:07.623\nit does have a specific name,\nmedium style two accent six.\n\n407\n00:22:07.623 --> 00:22:08.989\nI'm not gonna.\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna remember that.\n\n408\n00:22:08.989 --> 00:22:09.988\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know.\n\n409\n00:22:09.988 --> 00:22:14.759\nI am pointing it out very quickly\nthough cuz one thing this does kind of\n\n410\n00:22:14.759 --> 00:22:19.776\ncorrelate to is if you're ever gonna\nbe taking the PowerPoint MOS exam,\n\n411\n00:22:19.776 --> 00:22:22.903\nthe Microsoft Office User Specialist Exam,\n\n412\n00:22:22.903 --> 00:22:28.055\nthey will ask you questions like,\napply, what did we say this theme was?\n\n413\n00:22:28.055 --> 00:22:31.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Apply medium style to accent six to\n\n414\n00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:32.540\nthe selected table.\n\n415\n00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:33.573\nYou're like, what?\n\n416\n00:22:33.573 --> 00:22:37.710\n[LAUGH] So just know that if you\never are going to take that exam,\n\n417\n00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:42.050\njust hover over them and just find\nthe names, and you can see that this would\n\n418\n00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:46.660\nbe accent six, this would be accent six,\nyou can see the styles.\n\n419\n00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.270\nOkay, and then so\nthis would probably be accent five,\n\n420\n00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.750\nfour, three, and you can start kind of\ngetting the idea and the patterns of\n\n421\n00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:56.410\nhow they name these styles, but that one\nalways threw me off when I first saw it.\n\n422\n00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:59.340\nI'm like, I don't memorize these names.\n\n423\n00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.060\nSo anyways, I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick on that, and\n\n424\n00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:05.180\nyou can see that it takes\nthe banded rows and\n\n425\n00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:09.980\nthe top row goes ahead and does a solid\ncolor, it has a white like underneath it.\n\n426\n00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:16.000\nThe border colors are white because\nthat's what the style is letting us do,\n\n427\n00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.260\nand over here on the design you\nsee over on the left-hand side,\n\n428\n00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.030\nthe banded rows is part of the style,\nbut if I didn't like the banded rows,\n\n429\n00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.600\nyou can just uncheck them,\nand you can go that way.\n\n430\n00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.680\nRemember I was telling\nyou about that total row?\n\n431\n00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.090\nIt's all about the formatting.\n\n432\n00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:31.380\nIf I just check that total row on,\nyou see how then it goes ahead and\n\n433\n00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:36.920\napplies the formatting for that style,\nand it changes the background color\n\n434\n00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:43.375\nof the cells to be green and\nit bolds those last entries in there.\n\n435\n00:23:43.375 --> 00:23:45.950\nAnd the same,\nif I wanted to choose first column,\n\n436\n00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:50.340\nsee how automatically it applies that\nformat to the first column or maybe you\n\n437\n00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:55.210\nhave the last column cuz maybe that's were\nyour totals are of different activities.\n\n438\n00:23:55.210 --> 00:24:00.780\nSo that's really all it is, the total\nrow doesn't necessarily mean total.\n\n439\n00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.659\nIt's just types of formatting but\nit is nice to go through and\n\n440\n00:24:03.659 --> 00:24:04.850\ndo your banded columns.\n\n441\n00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.252\nI probably wouldn't do banded rows and\ncolumns,\n\n442\n00:24:07.252 --> 00:24:10.982\ncuz that kind of throws everything off,\nI would probably do One or the other.\n\n443\n00:24:10.982 --> 00:24:11.839\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne,\n\n444\n00:24:11.839 --> 00:24:15.600\nI'm noticing something about the table\nitself in terms of the content.\n\n445\n00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.510\nEverything's kind of looking\nlopsided there to the left.\n\n446\n00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:22.970\nCan we kinda make everything more of\na center justified if we needed to?\n\n447\n00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:24.818\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you saw that\ncuz it's been bothering me\n\n448\n00:24:24.818 --> 00:24:26.000\nthis whole time I was talking.\n\n449\n00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.243\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cuz I'm like I just\n\n450\n00:24:27.243 --> 00:24:27.863\nneed to center it.\n\n451\n00:24:27.863 --> 00:24:30.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just be back to center.\n\n452\n00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:31.671\nYes you can do that.\n\n453\n00:24:31.671 --> 00:24:34.071\nBecause I was going with\nthe over all styles first.\n\n454\n00:24:34.071 --> 00:24:37.433\nBut each cell can be\nformatted individually.\n\n455\n00:24:37.433 --> 00:24:41.901\nBecause maybe you wanted this top row or\nthis top cell since it's merge,\n\n456\n00:24:41.901 --> 00:24:43.890\nI want the text to the centered.\n\n457\n00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:45.460\nI want the text to be different color and\n\n458\n00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.700\nI really want the color of\nthe cell to be a different color.\n\n459\n00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:50.750\nYou can do all that.\n\n460\n00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.134\nSo I'm going to click in there.\n\n461\n00:24:52.134 --> 00:24:56.940\nI'm going to select the text just so I can\ngo ahead and do my text formatting first.\n\n462\n00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.090\nI could go over to the Home\ntab cuz it's too small too.\n\n463\n00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:00.750\nSo I could go ahead and\n\n464\n00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:04.790\nchange the font size,\nI could change the color if I wanted to.\n\n465\n00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:07.920\nI could go ahead and center it here and\nthat's a lot better.\n\n466\n00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.650\nSo that's all of the text\nformatting that I could do,\n\n467\n00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.290\nwould be back on the Home tab for\nthe most part.\n\n468\n00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:17.291\nBut if I get back into the design and\nformatting of the cell,\n\n469\n00:25:17.291 --> 00:25:22.251\nI got to go back over to the design tab\non the table tools and then actually,\n\n470\n00:25:22.251 --> 00:25:25.626\nI'm sorry, it is not,\nwell no we can start here.\n\n471\n00:25:25.626 --> 00:25:27.830\nSorry, I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\n472\n00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:28.880\nI was on the text.\n\n473\n00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.600\nThe text would be actually\nover on the layout and\n\n474\n00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.640\nthen the design would be the actual cell.\n\n475\n00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.490\nSo let's just stay here for now.\n\n476\n00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:39.558\nBecause I said wanted to make the\nbackground of that cell a different color,\n\n477\n00:25:39.558 --> 00:25:43.070\nyou can see right here that's\nthe shading or the fill of the cell.\n\n478\n00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:44.241\nSo I can go ahead and\n\n479\n00:25:44.241 --> 00:25:48.570\nmaybe that like a darker green\ncause I wanted a different accent.\n\n480\n00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:51.420\nI'm not sure if like yellow and\nred would really go for\n\n481\n00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.130\nthis, I mean maybe for\nIf we're doing Christmas or something.\n\n482\n00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.342\nBut I'm just gonna go ahead and\nmake it a little bit\n\n483\n00:25:57.342 --> 00:26:01.640\ndarker green because that's how I\nwant that cell to be formatted.\n\n484\n00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:07.128\nBut back to that text, you see how the\ntext in this cell is more towards the top.\n\n485\n00:26:07.128 --> 00:26:08.980\nWe went ahead and centered it.\n\n486\n00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:13.670\nThis way, horizontally, but I want it\ncentered this way, vertical alignment.\n\n487\n00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.639\nBig thing with me,\nyou go over to your layout, and\n\n488\n00:26:16.639 --> 00:26:21.024\nyou can see that I've got the horizontal\nformatting, or alignment, and\n\n489\n00:26:21.024 --> 00:26:23.823\nthen I have my vertical alignment, center.\n\n490\n00:26:23.823 --> 00:26:25.523\nIt's making me feel so much better, okay?\n\n491\n00:26:25.523 --> 00:26:28.808\nI will give you one little tidbit,\n\n492\n00:26:28.808 --> 00:26:33.799\ncuz I have had PowerPoints\nthat have been sent to me.\n\n493\n00:26:33.799 --> 00:26:37.430\nReally trying to change\nthe vertical alignment of this.\n\n494\n00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:41.660\nAnd I am clicking this, center alignment,\nit's still not working and\n\n495\n00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:46.187\nit's because I accidentally or maybe\non purpose they put an enter in there.\n\n496\n00:26:46.187 --> 00:26:49.760\nIf they cuz they're creating\nan extra character.\n\n497\n00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:50.900\nThere is an extra paragraph in there.\n\n498\n00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:55.310\nSo it thinks that there's text\neven though you don't see it.\n\n499\n00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:57.250\nIn Word you can do that,\nshow hide characters,\n\n500\n00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:58.850\nwhere you could see where\nall your paragraphs are.\n\n501\n00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:02.570\nIn PowerPoint you don't really have\nthat so it can really throw you off.\n\n502\n00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.950\nSo if you see that,\n\n503\n00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.590\nif you can click your cursor on to\nthe text, you got an enter in there.\n\n504\n00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:11.360\nSo if you hit the,\nwhoops that's the wrong key, there.\n\n505\n00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.980\nDelete, you see now it will go ahead and\napply that vertical centering.\n\n506\n00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.070\nThat I so wanted but\n\n507\n00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:21.450\nsometimes there's things in there\nthat will not let you do that.\n\n508\n00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.670\nSo always double check on that.\n\n509\n00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:29.290\nAnd I could go ahead if I wanted\nall of these rows to be centered,\n\n510\n00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:33.890\noops let me undo that, I can get that\neyebeam, I can click hold and drag.\n\n511\n00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:36.580\nTo go ahead and select all of these cells.\n\n512\n00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.520\nAnd I can go ahead and center it this way.\n\n513\n00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.210\nI can also center it vertically and\nit gets it there.\n\n514\n00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:43.760\nI forgot the total row whoops.\n\n515\n00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.680\nSo let's go ahead and\ngrab that one as well.\n\n516\n00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.630\nCenter, center.\n\n517\n00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:52.950\nAnd I'm feeling better\nabout how this is looking.\n\n518\n00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:58.000\nNow the only thing for me,\njust because I want the borders,\n\n519\n00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.250\nto be a little bit more defined\nwithin this area of a table.\n\n520\n00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:06.990\nSo again, selecting the cells that\nI want to apply this formating to.\n\n521\n00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:09.855\nI go back over into the design,\nand this is where I could,\n\n522\n00:28:09.855 --> 00:28:12.138\nI don't wanna change the background color.\n\n523\n00:28:12.138 --> 00:28:13.830\nI wanna change the border.\n\n524\n00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:18.510\nSo if I go to the border,\nI do wanna apply all borders here.\n\n525\n00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:21.070\nAnd then it's going to go ahead and\nput in that border.\n\n526\n00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:22.798\nNow why is it being black?\n\n527\n00:28:22.798 --> 00:28:27.024\nIt's because right over here these are the\nborder colors that are automatically and\n\n528\n00:28:27.024 --> 00:28:27.988\nI could make them.\n\n529\n00:28:27.988 --> 00:28:30.448\nI don't know if you really\nwant to make them dotted but\n\n530\n00:28:30.448 --> 00:28:33.800\nI am just gonna go ahead and say that I\ndo want it to be just a regular black.\n\n531\n00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:39.670\nBut you could go ahead and\nuse those different colors to go ahead and\n\n532\n00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:42.530\nchange what borders are in there.\n\n533\n00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.540\nAnd to me this is looking pretty good.\n\n534\n00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.860\nThe only other thing I would\ndo with this table, for\n\n535\n00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.540\nme, I would want to bold these words here.\n\n536\n00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.564\nSo I can go ahead and\nselect this text here.\n\n537\n00:28:53.564 --> 00:28:57.490\nGo back over to the Home tab and format\nthe text just like I would anything else.\n\n538\n00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:00.670\nIf you want it to be a little bit bigger,\nyou could of course go ahead and\n\n539\n00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:05.630\nchange the font size to maybe bump\nall of this up just a little bit.\n\n540\n00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:08.420\nChange the overall size of the table.\n\n541\n00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.580\nMaybe move it over a little bit, because\nI don't know if it's centered just yet.\n\n542\n00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.610\nThere we go.\n\n543\n00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:18.060\nAnd then I have, pretty much everything I\nneed in the table of how we recreated it.\n\n544\n00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:22.403\nI did want to point out just a few\nother things in those tabs just so\n\n545\n00:29:22.403 --> 00:29:26.820\nI can cover almost everything\nthat we have available to us.\n\n546\n00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.370\nWe went over pretty much\neverything in the design tab.\n\n547\n00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:33.460\nWe do of course have the different ways\nthat you could apply styles to the text\n\n548\n00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:38.650\nwithin your table just like\nyou have with your pictures or\n\n549\n00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:40.460\ntext within your shapes,\nanything like that.\n\n550\n00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.789\nOn the layout tab,\nthere were a few other things.\n\n551\n00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:46.330\nThe text direction.\n\n552\n00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:52.820\nOkay, so maybe I have columns\nthat are really skinny, right?\n\n553\n00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.325\nAnd I wanna go ahead hello,\nthat's not what I wanted to do.\n\n554\n00:29:55.325 --> 00:29:56.220\n[LAUGH] Got it.\n\n555\n00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.750\nRemember, what did I say?\n\n556\n00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:59.720\nAlways look at your mouse cursor icon.\n\n557\n00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.270\nThat's what I'm looking for.\n\n558\n00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.200\nAll right, but the text is horizontal.\n\n559\n00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.890\nI wanted the text to go up and down.\n\n560\n00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:10.860\nYou can go ahead and change the text\ndirection to rotate 270 degrees,\n\n561\n00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.550\nbasically going up, or\nyou could have it go down.\n\n562\n00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:18.140\nRight now, these are not high enough, so\nI'm just gonna go ahead and grab this.\n\n563\n00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:22.589\nYou can see that you could go ahead and\nchange the direction of the text if you\n\n564\n00:30:22.589 --> 00:30:25.990\nwanted to have well,\nthe text in a different direction.\n\n565\n00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:27.766\nI'm gonna undo to show you that and\n\n566\n00:30:27.766 --> 00:30:31.150\nthen the other thing you could\nalso change the cell margins.\n\n567\n00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:35.442\nNow that would be if you had it left\naligned and maybe I would go with the top,\n\n568\n00:30:35.442 --> 00:30:39.414\ndo you see how, and I'm gonna zoom\nin a little bit so you can see this.\n\n569\n00:30:39.414 --> 00:30:43.601\nYou see how they're like I call them like\nthe cushions on the insides of the cells\n\n570\n00:30:43.601 --> 00:30:47.288\nthat what you call cell margin just\nlike you have margins in Word around\n\n571\n00:30:47.288 --> 00:30:50.000\nthe whole paper of where\nyou don't want text to be.\n\n572\n00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.737\nYou have the same thing with cell margins\nand it's automatically applied so\n\n573\n00:30:54.737 --> 00:30:57.845\nyou can see the normal but\nif you wanted it closer or\n\n574\n00:30:57.845 --> 00:31:00.376\nfurther away from the edge of the cells.\n\n575\n00:31:00.376 --> 00:31:04.803\nYou could go, if I click none, do you\nsee how it's right up against that cell,\n\n576\n00:31:04.803 --> 00:31:09.050\nwhich to me, I would always want to add\nmargins rather than take them away.\n\n577\n00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:14.534\nBut since I usually do the vertical and\nhorizontal centering I don't really have\n\n578\n00:31:14.534 --> 00:31:18.695\nto worry about margins so much, but\nif you have other types of alignments like\n\n579\n00:31:18.695 --> 00:31:22.618\nthe left and top, it could be something\nthat you might want to consider.\n\n580\n00:31:22.618 --> 00:31:27.708\nBut with our center center, we're\nprobably not gonna get much around that.\n\n581\n00:31:27.708 --> 00:31:31.112\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, another thing that\nI actually notice, is that now that\n\n582\n00:31:31.112 --> 00:31:35.220\nyou've done all that, the columns still\nnot nice and even as they once were.\n\n583\n00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.390\nWe had moved them around\na little bit more.\n\n584\n00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:38.450\nIs there a easy way for\nme to just distribute that, and\n\n585\n00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:40.640\nmake sure that all my columns are even?\n\n586\n00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:46.170\n&gt;&gt; There is, because you could guess,\nlike okay that looks about the same width\n\n587\n00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:52.540\nthere, but they do have a nice easy button\nand that is the distribute columns button.\n\n588\n00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.930\nSo, if I select the cells that I\nwould like, or the columns, or\n\n589\n00:31:56.930 --> 00:32:01.150\nthe whole table for that matter really,\nthat I wanted to say\n\n590\n00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:04.690\nall of these just go ahead and\ndistribute equally across this space.\n\n591\n00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:07.842\nYou can click that little button\nright there, and you can distribute.\n\n592\n00:32:07.842 --> 00:32:12.492\nI love that button, because just\nthe same way that I'm kind of particular\n\n593\n00:32:12.492 --> 00:32:16.017\nabout the cell margins and\nmy center center alignment,\n\n594\n00:32:16.017 --> 00:32:20.410\nthe same thing would be for\nall of the columns being the same width.\n\n595\n00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.200\nAnd you could do the same\nwith the rows as well.\n\n596\n00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.696\nBut you could also see when we were doing\nthe dragging with the mouse cursor icons.\n\n597\n00:32:28.696 --> 00:32:33.750\nYou could also be here in the cell\nsize and the row heights.\n\n598\n00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.680\nYou can go ahead and bump that up.\n\n599\n00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.480\nBut you can see that it's actually not\ntaking all of them, so I'd probably want\n\n600\n00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:42.150\nto go ahead and make sure that I\nhad all of them selected first.\n\n601\n00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:46.780\nBut that actually is because I am in the\ncell size not necessarily the row height.\n\n602\n00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.700\nBut you could come over here.\n\n603\n00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:52.630\nAnd go ahead and change the overall\nheight of the table, and\n\n604\n00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:53.690\nthat's actually doing the table.\n\n605\n00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:57.230\nBut what I'm trying to get at is\nyou do have different numbers, or\n\n606\n00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.990\nthe boxes that you could go in and\n\n607\n00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:04.960\nspecifically say how high do I want\nthe table, how wide do I want the table.\n\n608\n00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:09.840\nOr with cells selected how high\ndo I want that row to be and\n\n609\n00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.340\nhow wide would I want those columns to be.\n\n610\n00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:17.510\nSo you could go ahead and\nnumerically type those in.\n\n611\n00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:21.002\nAnd I think what's going on here\nis that they're not there we go.\n\n612\n00:33:21.002 --> 00:33:22.200\nThat was starting to bug me [LAUGH].\n\n613\n00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.070\nI was like why isn't one doing the other?\n\n614\n00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:28.600\nIt's because I actually didn't have\nthe text of all of the cells formatted as\n\n615\n00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.630\ncenter center.\n\n616\n00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:30.760\nBecause we're doing the cell margins.\n\n617\n00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.870\nThat's why it was doing that.\n\n618\n00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:35.410\nSo see, I did the same thing it's\nlike why is that not working?\n\n619\n00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:38.060\nI have to go back and\nremember select to effect,\n\n620\n00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:41.970\nto be able to get all the formatting\nthat I want to have consistently.\n\n621\n00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:45.410\nAnd that pretty much covers\nalmost everything on the ribbons.\n\n622\n00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:49.232\nAnd everything that you could\nprobably ever want to do with tables.\n\n623\n00:33:49.232 --> 00:33:54.882\nAnd they're fun and easy and that's\nwhere you can compare your eating and\n\n624\n00:33:54.882 --> 00:33:57.262\nsleeping habits of your cats.\n\n625\n00:33:57.262 --> 00:34:00.562\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, well that is a lot of\ngreat information for us to think about\n\n626\n00:34:00.562 --> 00:34:04.350\nwhen we do want to actually be able to\ncompare, let's say, a lot of information.\n\n627\n00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:05.590\nBut really on one slide.\n\n628\n00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:08.890\nSo Vonne showed us not only\nthe different parts of the tables, but\n\n629\n00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:10.810\nalso of course how to create a table and\n\n630\n00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:14.538\nthen format it to make it look the way\nthat one in our presentation as well.\n\n631\n00:34:14.538 --> 00:34:16.138\nWell that's a great place for\nus to also sign off then.\n\n632\n00:34:16.138 --> 00:34:19.262\nFor ITProTV I've been\nyour host Ronnie Wong.\n\n633\n00:34:19.262 --> 00:34:20.286\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n634\n00:34:20.286 --> 00:34:22.831\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nMicrosoft PowerPoint 2016.\n\n635\n00:34:22.831 --> 00:34:26.990\n[MUSIC]\n\n636\n00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:34.221\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:08.247\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.247 --> 00:00:10.680\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\n\n5\n00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.500\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.200\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today\nyou're watching Microsoft PowerPoint 2016.\n\n7\n00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.481\nWe're specifically gonna be diving into\nthe realm of charts and when to add\n\n8\n00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:26.814\nthem and of course how to use them inside\nof your PowerPoint presentation and\n\n9\n00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:29.366\nhere to help us of course is\nour subject matter expert Mrs.\n\n10\n00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.252\nVonne Smith, Vonne welcome back\nto the studios how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:32.252 --> 00:00:34.890\n&gt;&gt; Thank you I'm good I'm ready to chart\n\n12\n00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.762\neverything we're gonna chart our\ncourse on using chars yes exactly.\n\n13\n00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:44.690\n[LAUGH] Sorry I couldn't help myself So\nwhat is a chart?\n\n14\n00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.230\nIt's another graphical\nrepresentation of our information,\n\n15\n00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.460\nwhich I feel like we've been saying for\nquite a few episodes right.\n\n16\n00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.846\nCuz we had our smart art and we had our\ntables and now we're here to charts.\n\n17\n00:00:55.846 --> 00:01:00.925\nSo again, it's just another way of\nbeing able to show comparisons,\n\n18\n00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:03.658\nshow information, show your data.\n\n19\n00:01:03.658 --> 00:01:06.135\nIt really just depends on\nwhich way you wanna go.\n\n20\n00:01:06.135 --> 00:01:11.167\nSo we're going to continue on with our cat\nactivity and we're going to chart this\n\n21\n00:01:11.167 --> 00:01:16.347\ninto a clustered column chart and give all\nthe different ways that we're going to,\n\n22\n00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:19.973\nhow do we format our data series and\nwe add a data table, and\n\n23\n00:01:19.973 --> 00:01:24.656\nyou can already tell I'm throwing\na bunch of vocabulary words, don't I?\n\n24\n00:01:24.656 --> 00:01:30.226\nSo, we're gonna start with how do we\neven identify part of a chart and\n\n25\n00:01:30.226 --> 00:01:32.640\nI have a file for that Ronnie.\n\n26\n00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.979\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna g ahead and\n\n27\n00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.980\njump right in to parts of a chart.\n\n28\n00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.650\nThere's a lot, there are quite\na few pieces to a chart and\n\n29\n00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.680\nyou can see right here there's all sort\nof different ones, I'm gonna zoom in\n\n30\n00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.784\njust a little bit you know what\nthe other thing is I'm going to do?\n\n31\n00:01:48.784 --> 00:01:53.050\nIs I'm gonna collapse our ribbon down,\nso it gives me a lot more real estate,\n\n32\n00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.850\nbecause I am on a lower resolution,\n\n33\n00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.310\nto be able to broadcast that to you\nguys nice and sharp, and in HD.\n\n34\n00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.370\nSo I'm just gonna double-click\non that ribbon, and\n\n35\n00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.440\nbe able to collapse that down, and zoom\nthis in just a little bit more for you.\n\n36\n00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.989\nSo you can see that going along our\nsame theme of comparing Bishop and\n\n37\n00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.295\nFuego to how much they sleep and\nhow much they eat,\n\n38\n00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:21.180\nI'm gonna change the numbers around\non this slide for display purposes,\n\n39\n00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.153\nbut you can see it's a way that\nwe can compare information.\n\n40\n00:02:25.153 --> 00:02:29.461\nWe're taking Fuego in the blue,\nBishop in the orange and\n\n41\n00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:33.700\nwe're putting them side by\nside into what categories.\n\n42\n00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.521\nSo you can see along the bottom,\nthat would be the other,\n\n43\n00:02:37.521 --> 00:02:42.297\nthat would be the horizontal,\nthey call that the category access, and\n\n44\n00:02:42.297 --> 00:02:47.472\ngoing up that would be the value access,\nso we're comparing Bishop and Fuego\n\n45\n00:02:47.472 --> 00:02:52.911\nto sleeping, eating, playing and meowing\nand how many hours a day they do that.\n\n46\n00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:59.330\nAnd you can see that each one of these\nactivities like the sleeping and eating.\n\n47\n00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.270\nThey call those data series.\n\n48\n00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.300\nSo it is a series of data for Bishop.\n\n49\n00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.820\nThere is a series of data for Fuego.\n\n50\n00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.606\nAnd then the numbers or the values\nare being represented in those bars or\n\n51\n00:03:13.606 --> 00:03:16.658\nthose columns that you have going up.\n\n52\n00:03:16.658 --> 00:03:21.078\nAnd you have different pieces of\na chart that you could add in,\n\n53\n00:03:21.078 --> 00:03:22.860\nlike the data labels.\n\n54\n00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.380\nDo you have to have the numbers\non the top of those data series?\n\n55\n00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.442\nNo, you don't have to, but\nthese are options that you could add in.\n\n56\n00:03:28.442 --> 00:03:30.479\nDo you have to have a title access?\n\n57\n00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:34.238\nDo you have to have a title on\neither the vertical or horizontal.\n\n58\n00:03:34.238 --> 00:03:38.465\nNo, you don't have to but it makes it\na little bit easier for us to be able\n\n59\n00:03:38.465 --> 00:03:43.790\nto quickly see what are we comparing here,\nwhat are we charting actually.\n\n60\n00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.100\nAnd then the area that you see everything\nthat's known as the plot area.\n\n61\n00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.834\nAnd then past that you\nhave your chart area and\n\n62\n00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:57.236\nthen your grid lines to be able to\ngive you those lines across to see\n\n63\n00:03:57.236 --> 00:04:02.672\nwhere your numbers are and\nhow high does the range of the hours go.\n\n64\n00:04:02.672 --> 00:04:05.700\nNow I'm putting all of\nthese in here because\n\n65\n00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.330\nI wanted to at least label them for\nyou here Because your mouse\n\n66\n00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.320\ncursor being able to hover over what\ndo I want to select to affect it?\n\n67\n00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.358\nHow do I want to format my data series?\n\n68\n00:04:17.358 --> 00:04:20.656\nLike I wanna change the color or I want\nto change the color of the plot area.\n\n69\n00:04:20.656 --> 00:04:23.295\nWhere you click makes a big difference and\n\n70\n00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:27.760\nwatching what those little tool tips\nthat come up can really be handy.\n\n71\n00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.252\nSo I'm gonna just go ahead and just hover\nmy mouse see there it is right there,\n\n72\n00:04:31.252 --> 00:04:32.340\nthat's the plot area.\n\n73\n00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.519\nIf I click right now, do you see\nhow the little bubbles in the area,\n\n74\n00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:40.510\nthat's showing you the plot\narea that I have selected.\n\n75\n00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.030\nIf I hover over here,\nsee that's the series.\n\n76\n00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.510\nIf I click here, now you can see\nthe little dots that go across all four of\n\n77\n00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.730\ndata series in this chart because\nthen I could change the color.\n\n78\n00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.100\nMaybe I wanna change\nthe color of the chart area.\n\n79\n00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.930\nWatch those hover to discovers.\n\n80\n00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.400\nThose little tool steps will really make\na big difference as to knowing where\n\n81\n00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.180\nyou're at and what you're going\nto be clicking on to select it,\n\n82\n00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.490\nto then Change font, color, size,\nbackground color, word art styles,\n\n83\n00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.370\nall those different things that we\nbeen going over and over again.\n\n84\n00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.400\nAnd the different places in PowerPoint\nwhere we can add our elements.\n\n85\n00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.965\nSo identifying parts of a chart and\nthat's this slide title.\n\n86\n00:05:20.965 --> 00:05:24.669\n[LAUGH] I broke this down into some\nother slides, you could see underneath,\n\n87\n00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.190\nthis is where you can add\nsomething known as a data table.\n\n88\n00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.520\nAgain, one is if you want it or\nyou don't want it.\n\n89\n00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.244\nBut at least you know what it is\nwhen we go through those options of\n\n90\n00:05:35.244 --> 00:05:37.263\nadding a data table or not.\n\n91\n00:05:37.263 --> 00:05:41.412\nWhen you get into actually imputing\nthe information into a chart,\n\n92\n00:05:41.412 --> 00:05:45.662\nyou're going to be inserting it\ninto what almost looks like Excel.\n\n93\n00:05:45.662 --> 00:05:51.340\nSo understanding what's going\nto show in the chart and\n\n94\n00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.710\nwhere they kinda correlate to, I've made\nsome labels here, and you'll be able\n\n95\n00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.960\nto see when we enter the chart, it's kinda\nhelpful, it gives you those place holders.\n\n96\n00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.530\nBut I wanted to at least show you\na slide that will go ahead and\n\n97\n00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.390\ndemonstrate those series and value labels,\nbecause they do call them series.\n\n98\n00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.776\nAnd then we had our categories,\nwhich will go along the bottom.\n\n99\n00:06:11.776 --> 00:06:16.754\nAnd then the legend that would be\nover on that right hand side is\n\n100\n00:06:16.754 --> 00:06:19.830\nwhere what is blue and what is orange.\n\n101\n00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.290\nWhat are the colors that are being\nrepresented in this chart.\n\n102\n00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.380\nThe location of where you put\nthat legend is up to you.\n\n103\n00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.550\nBut again, what is a legend?\n\n104\n00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.729\nIt's the color block thing.\n\n105\n00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:34.250\n[LAUGH] That tells us what our\ndifferent status series are.\n\n106\n00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.450\nAnd then this last slide,\nI wanted to show you how you could change.\n\n107\n00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.169\nCoz how you want to show\nwhat you're comparing,\n\n108\n00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:46.390\nyou could see,\ncoz this really shows what Flago does.\n\n109\n00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.770\nSo our category is Flago and\n\n110\n00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.820\nthe different series would be the things\nthat he does as opposed to Bishop.\n\n111\n00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.570\nYou could see that while he\nreally likes to sleep and\n\n112\n00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.060\nthe next thing he really\nlikes to do is play.\n\n113\n00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.250\nSo you can get so what do I want and\nhow do I want to display the data?\n\n114\n00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.486\nLike per cat, per activity,\nwhich one conveys what I'm trying to show?\n\n115\n00:07:10.486 --> 00:07:13.480\nIt's like the same but different.\n\n116\n00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.020\nOne of my favorite sayings.\n\n117\n00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.830\nIt's the same but it's different,\nwhich doesn't make any sense but\n\n118\n00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.210\nit makes sense to me.\n\n119\n00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.380\nAnd so those are the different things\nthat you can do with your chart and\n\n120\n00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.200\nidentifying the pieces of the charts.\n\n121\n00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.900\n&gt;&gt; Vonne,\nthat really makes a lot of sense.\n\n122\n00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.360\nThe very fact that what charts really do\nhelp us to do is to take that numerical\n\n123\n00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.540\ndata information that we do have,\nas well as the different categories, and\n\n124\n00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:42.920\nput them into some type of graphic form so\nthat whoever is viewing the information\n\n125\n00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.000\ncan view and make decisions off them or\nbe able to see what we want them to see.\n\n126\n00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.618\nGraphically, most people will tend to\neasily deal with graphics rather than sit\n\n127\n00:07:50.618 --> 00:07:51.361\nthere and try and\n\n128\n00:07:51.361 --> 00:07:54.192\nfigure out by the numbers that\nthey end up seeing very quickly.\n\n129\n00:07:54.192 --> 00:07:57.633\nGraphics are a great way for\nus to be able to do this.\n\n130\n00:07:57.633 --> 00:08:01.608\nSo Vonne, now that we understand\nthe idea of using the charts,\n\n131\n00:08:01.608 --> 00:08:04.760\nwhere are we going to begin\nin terms of making one?\n\n132\n00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.777\nExact, we're gonna build it.\n\n133\n00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:06.411\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n134\n00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:10.523\nwe're just gonna play with\nthe numbers of the eating and\n\n135\n00:08:10.523 --> 00:08:15.090\nsleeping habits of my two lazy cats,\n[LAUGH] and go from there.\n\n136\n00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.230\nAnd then add all of those\ndifferent pieces in.\n\n137\n00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.900\nBut that's one of the biggest problem or\nhurdles, I think,\n\n138\n00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:26.290\npeople have is like I have this idea\nof what I want it to look like.\n\n139\n00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.150\nI just don't know what it means.\n\n140\n00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:32.270\nI get into this and I,\nthey're talking about series, and access,\n\n141\n00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.540\nand I'm not really sure.\n\n142\n00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:39.190\nIf you just take a moment just to kind of\nfamiliarize yourself with those pieces,\n\n143\n00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.360\nit becomes a lot easier.\n\n144\n00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.140\nSo I always like to go over those\nelements first because I feel that's\n\n145\n00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.620\nkind of a hang up for most people.\n\n146\n00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.460\nAll right, so now let's go ahead and\ninsert our chart.\n\n147\n00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.630\nWe're gonna go ahead, I'm gonna\ndouble-click on the tab to go ahead and\n\n148\n00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.950\nexpand out that ribbon again.\n\n149\n00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.890\nAnd I'm here, I'm gonna add a new slide.\n\n150\n00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:00.000\nWe could go with our title and\ncontent and do the little button for\n\n151\n00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.230\nthe placeholder to insert a chart.\n\n152\n00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.760\nOr do the blank and\ninsert it as an element or an object.\n\n153\n00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.493\nI'm just gonna do the title and content.\n\n154\n00:09:09.493 --> 00:09:15.850\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and click on this\nlittle button right there to insert chart.\n\n155\n00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:20.003\nAnd I click on it, now there are lots\nof different type of charts.\n\n156\n00:09:20.003 --> 00:09:22.960\nI said we were going to be\ncreating clustered column chart,\n\n157\n00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:29.030\nbecause I think that's the easiest one to\nlearn how to create a chart to start with.\n\n158\n00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.790\nAnd you see on the left,\nthere is line charts.\n\n159\n00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:36.440\nBecause depending on the data that you\nare trying to display, a line chart,\n\n160\n00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.890\nthat might be good for\nmaybe tracking sales across a department.\n\n161\n00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:46.552\nEach department has different sales, and\nthen you could really see the ups and\n\n162\n00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:49.176\nthe downs and the trends,\nif you wanna say.\n\n163\n00:09:49.176 --> 00:09:52.704\nSo a line graph, or sorry,\na line chart, graphs and charts you can\n\n164\n00:09:52.704 --> 00:09:57.010\nkinda use those interchangeably a lot\nof times, might be a good way to do it.\n\n165\n00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.790\nPie charts, right.\n\n166\n00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:03.440\nIn the 24 hours in the day,\nhow much time has Fuego spent eating, and\n\n167\n00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.380\nsleeping, and meowing?\n\n168\n00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:09.190\nBut that's comparing one thing,\nmaybe a year.\n\n169\n00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.670\nAnd these are the quarters or\nwhat have you or\n\n170\n00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.380\nthe different sales within a quarter.\n\n171\n00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:17.780\nSo you're taking one element and then\nusing multiple categories to go ahead and\n\n172\n00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:18.760\ngo across.\n\n173\n00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.630\nA bar chart's really just a different\nway of putting a cluster column.\n\n174\n00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.470\nIt's just instead of this way,\nit's this way.\n\n175\n00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.430\nAnd there's some other\nones throughout here.\n\n176\n00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.980\nThese surface charts, I'll tell you,\nthey start looking like origami to me.\n\n177\n00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.810\nI know that there are purposes for\nsurface charts.\n\n178\n00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:36.750\nBut in my world, I just see birds,\nI see paper birds [LAUGH].\n\n179\n00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:40.400\nThere's a box and whisker,\nlook at that there, Ronnie.\n\n180\n00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.055\nI know it has a purpose, so there are\ndifferent types of charts you can go with.\n\n181\n00:10:45.055 --> 00:10:47.921\nWe're gonna stick with the basic one and\ngo with our column.\n\n182\n00:10:47.921 --> 00:10:51.653\nYou could make it a little bit more\n3D-ish, but you've probably gotten,\n\n183\n00:10:51.653 --> 00:10:54.977\nif you've watched some of these\nother episodes in our series is that\n\n184\n00:10:54.977 --> 00:10:58.825\nonce you add an element, like a Smart Art\ngraphic, you could always go back and\n\n185\n00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:01.900\nchange it afterwards because\nit gives you those options.\n\n186\n00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.590\nSo we'll just stay with,\nwhoops, whoa, sorry.\n\n187\n00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.672\nI hovered over it and\n\n188\n00:11:05.672 --> 00:11:09.180\nI forgot that it gives you a larger\npreview if you hover over that.\n\n189\n00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.480\nBut we're just gonna go ahead and\nsay thank you, and we're gonna click OK.\n\n190\n00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:18.426\nAnd it adds a chart, and\nit automatically adds in that area or\n\n191\n00:11:18.426 --> 00:11:23.460\nwhat looks almost like Excel for\nus to insert that chart data.\n\n192\n00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:28.180\nAnd you can see, it's shown in\ncategory one, two, three, four,\n\n193\n00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.420\nseries one, two three.\n\n194\n00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:36.890\nAnd it's showing the labels up here\nin the baby Excel, if we can call it.\n\n195\n00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:40.650\nAnd to be able to show you where\nyou're supposed to put the pieces,\n\n196\n00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.030\nwhich is really nice.\n\n197\n00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:43.480\nI think it's really, really helpful.\n\n198\n00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.510\nBefore, you had to kinda\nguess where you were going.\n\n199\n00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.690\nSo I feel they've done a really\ngood job of making it easier for\n\n200\n00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:54.000\nyou to understand where am I\nsupposed to put my information.\n\n201\n00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.030\nAll right, so we said that our\ncategories are gonna be the sleep,\n\n202\n00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.300\neat, play, and meow.\n\n203\n00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.040\nSo you click on your cell\nthat you wanna type in.\n\n204\n00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.370\nAnd ou ahead and type in sleep.\n\n205\n00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.810\nAnd I'm gonna hit the down arrow, or\n\n206\n00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:09.370\nyou can hit Enter because you\nare in Excel, in a sense.\n\n207\n00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.616\nSo if you know your different ways of\nnavigating around Excel with your Tabs and\n\n208\n00:12:12.616 --> 00:12:15.430\nyour Enters to get over\nto the next column,\n\n209\n00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:19.010\nor Enter to get down in your next row,\nyou can use those.\n\n210\n00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:22.310\nBut you can use your mouse or\nyou can use your keyboard, your up and\n\n211\n00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.751\ndown arrows just as easily.\n\n212\n00:12:23.751 --> 00:12:28.361\nAll right, so we got sleep,\nwe got eat, we've got play,\n\n213\n00:12:28.361 --> 00:12:31.240\nright, and meow, meow meow.\n\n214\n00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.674\nSo we've got our different categories,\nand it just so\n\n215\n00:12:34.674 --> 00:12:37.370\nhappened that it gave me four categories.\n\n216\n00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:42.443\nWell, what if I need to compare eat,\nsleep, meow, and roll over?\n\n217\n00:12:42.443 --> 00:12:45.110\n[LAUGH] I don't know about that.\n\n218\n00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:52.088\nBut you can, if you needed another\ncategory, I could go with roll over.\n\n219\n00:12:52.088 --> 00:12:56.070\n[LAUGH] I don't know if a cat\nreally rolls over very well.\n\n220\n00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.870\nBut I know you can train them to do that.\n\n221\n00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.384\nCouldn't do it with mine.\n\n222\n00:13:00.384 --> 00:13:04.678\n[LAUGH] But you know, maybe if I\ngave him enough treats, he might.\n\n223\n00:13:04.678 --> 00:13:07.210\n&gt;&gt; Might sleep more and eat more, yeah.\n\n224\n00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.500\n&gt;&gt; Probably exactly what he would do.\n\n225\n00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.600\nOkay, but just to demonstrate that\nyou could add another category.\n\n226\n00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.750\nOr what if I didn't want those?\n\n227\n00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.140\nI could go ahead and delete.\n\n228\n00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.950\nNow if I just deleted it, it's not\ngonna really take the information.\n\n229\n00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:26.760\nYou really have to delete the entire\nrow for it to really go away.\n\n230\n00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:34.000\nSo in Excel, how you can select and delete\nrows is if you see that arrow pointing.\n\n231\n00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.960\nWe saw in doing our tables\nin another episode.\n\n232\n00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.662\nSo if you click there,\nthat's highlighting the entire row.\n\n233\n00:13:39.662 --> 00:13:43.592\nThen, you can right-click right\nover the row number, okay.\n\n234\n00:13:43.592 --> 00:13:46.340\nDon't right-click anywhere else,\nright over the row number.\n\n235\n00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.180\nYou could delete that and\nthen it goes away.\n\n236\n00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.620\nAnd you can see your chart\nchanging when you do that.\n\n237\n00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:58.430\nSo I can go ahead and right-click right\non row five and I can delete that.\n\n238\n00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:01.130\nAnd you can see I'm back to,\nI deleted one, didn't I?\n\n239\n00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:04.110\nOkay well that's all right,\nI can go ahead and add it.\n\n240\n00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.630\nI could go ahead and say meow,\nI went a little too far.\n\n241\n00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.200\nAnd so there's our fourth category.\n\n242\n00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.840\nNow I did go ahead and delete some of\nthe data that's in there but that's okay.\n\n243\n00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.730\nAs long as you stay within those boxes,\n\n244\n00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.250\nyou see the purples and\nthe reds and the blues\n\n245\n00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.700\nto give you those areas of where you're\nsupposed to put in this information.\n\n246\n00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.230\nSo let's go ahead and do our series.\n\n247\n00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.020\nWe have Fuego, right,\nthat's our first cat.\n\n248\n00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:30.660\nAnd I'm hitting the Tab key and\nI'm gonna go ahead and say Bishop.\n\n249\n00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.410\nBut I don't have a third series,\n\n250\n00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:36.550\nI don't have another cat that\nI want to compare across.\n\n251\n00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.960\nSo same way you can delete a row,\nyou can delete a column.\n\n252\n00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.720\nSo you come over here to the column header\nwith the black arrow pointing down.\n\n253\n00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.240\nYou can right-click and\nthen you can go ahead and click delete.\n\n254\n00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:53.440\nAnd then you deleted that series out of\nwhat you're trying to do for your data.\n\n255\n00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.780\nNow it's really just, all right,\nput in the information.\n\n256\n00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.320\nHow much does Fuego sleep?\n\n257\n00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.620\nI think we said 16, and he eats,\nI'm hitting Enter to go down.\n\n258\n00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.952\nHe eats six hours, and\nhe plays one hour, then meows one hour.\n\n259\n00:15:06.952 --> 00:15:11.115\nAnd then back up to bishop, I can go\nahead and make this bigger by the way,\n\n260\n00:15:11.115 --> 00:15:12.220\nthe whole object.\n\n261\n00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.004\nYou get the two pointed arrows down here\nmake it a little bit easier for me to see.\n\n262\n00:15:16.004 --> 00:15:20.579\nSo Bishop was 12, and then he eats 2, and\n\n263\n00:15:20.579 --> 00:15:25.784\nthen he plays 6, and\nhelp me with my math, he 4?\n\n264\n00:15:25.784 --> 00:15:27.650\n&gt;&gt; Four.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, is that the remaining?\n\n265\n00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:28.730\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n266\n00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:33.700\nSo now I have got the data that\nI wanted to put in for Fuego and\n\n267\n00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.450\nBishop for all of their activities.\n\n268\n00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:40.550\nAnd I have got the chart information\nthat I want to display, so I am done.\n\n269\n00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.946\nAll I got to do is go ahead and\nclose out of this area.\n\n270\n00:15:42.946 --> 00:15:46.910\nAnd this is,\nI don't know what's going on, but\n\n271\n00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:49.040\nthis happened earlier when I was testing.\n\n272\n00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.000\nSomething's going a little haywire with my\nvirtual machine that I have going on on my\n\n273\n00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.572\ncomputer.\n\n274\n00:15:53.572 --> 00:15:55.545\nSo that normally won't happen.\n\n275\n00:15:55.545 --> 00:15:58.816\nSo there's some weird\nglitch that's going on,\n\n276\n00:15:58.816 --> 00:16:01.858\nit Closes down PowerPoint, so ignore that.\n\n277\n00:16:01.858 --> 00:16:03.231\nIt might happen a few more times.\n\n278\n00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:07.280\nBut I just wanted to let you\nknow that that is me, not you.\n\n279\n00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.880\nSo [LAUGH] let's keep on moving back\ninto our chart information here.\n\n280\n00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.730\nAnd I'm just gonna go ahead and change\nmy view down here to fit the slide in\n\n281\n00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.650\nthe current window so\nyou can see it overall.\n\n282\n00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:18.702\nAnd there you go.\n\n283\n00:16:18.702 --> 00:16:22.051\nI've got my information in, but\nI need it to look a little bit better.\n\n284\n00:16:22.051 --> 00:16:23.940\nI need to change some things.\n\n285\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.260\nAll right, click anywhere in the chart,\njust to go ahead and activate the chart so\n\n286\n00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.945\nI can get my contextual tabs\navailable in my Design and Format.\n\n287\n00:16:32.945 --> 00:16:35.159\nHm, kind of a consistent theme\non anything that we add.\n\n288\n00:16:35.159 --> 00:16:39.108\nThere's always a Design and there's\nalways a Format tab within our charts,\n\n289\n00:16:39.108 --> 00:16:42.159\nour tables, our smart art graphics,\nall of those things.\n\n290\n00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.944\nSo, you could go ahead and\nhave chart styles,\n\n291\n00:16:45.944 --> 00:16:49.310\noverall formatting of all of\nyour different elements and\n\n292\n00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.241\nyou can hover over each one of\nthem to see what that looks like.\n\n293\n00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:54.590\nThat's kind of fancy.\n\n294\n00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:59.330\nAnd you can notice that some of\nthem will add different grid lines,\n\n295\n00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.960\ndifferent information.\n\n296\n00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.500\nSo you could go through and\nstart with a style.\n\n297\n00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.589\nMaybe we'll go with the dark style for\nright now.\n\n298\n00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:10.832\nHere, it adds a chart title.\n\n299\n00:17:10.832 --> 00:17:13.906\nBut Chart Title is not very descriptive,\nis it?\n\n300\n00:17:13.906 --> 00:17:16.938\nSo if I wanted that,\nyou could just go ahead and click on it.\n\n301\n00:17:16.938 --> 00:17:17.899\nSo I hovered over it.\n\n302\n00:17:17.899 --> 00:17:19.903\nI know my four-point arrow is over there.\n\n303\n00:17:19.903 --> 00:17:23.357\nThen I could go ahead and\nclick my I-beam in there.\n\n304\n00:17:23.357 --> 00:17:25.296\nAnd I'll zoom in so you can see this.\n\n305\n00:17:25.296 --> 00:17:28.312\nAnd then I could select my text\nbecause I wanna select the information\n\n306\n00:17:28.312 --> 00:17:29.145\nthat's in there.\n\n307\n00:17:29.145 --> 00:17:35.395\nAnd then I could take, I could delete,\nand I could type in Cat Activity.\n\n308\n00:17:35.395 --> 00:17:37.038\nJust for right now,\n\n309\n00:17:37.038 --> 00:17:43.570\nI don't really need a title of my slide\nbecause I have a title of the chart.\n\n310\n00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:48.310\nSo if you wanted to, I could just go\nahead and click on the slide title, hit\n\n311\n00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:54.600\nthe Delete, and then it gives me a little\nmore room to make my overall chart bigger.\n\n312\n00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.064\nSo that's just kinda something that,\nas I'm formatting, this is what I want.\n\n313\n00:17:59.064 --> 00:18:01.356\nSo I went ahead and\njust showed you how you could do that.\n\n314\n00:18:01.356 --> 00:18:04.267\nI'm gonna click on the chart,\nright at the edge.\n\n315\n00:18:04.267 --> 00:18:09.388\nAnd I could go ahead and extend the height\nof the overall chart to make it fit\n\n316\n00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:15.004\nthe slide a little bit better if I wanted\nto and align it, because it is an object,\n\n317\n00:18:15.004 --> 00:18:19.423\njust like anything else that\nwe've been doing in PowerPoint.\n\n318\n00:18:19.423 --> 00:18:24.220\nAll right, so I apply the style, but\nI saw in the demonstrations back\n\n319\n00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:29.204\nhere on slide one, there were Axis titles,\nand there are data labels.\n\n320\n00:18:29.204 --> 00:18:31.387\nBut I don't see, back on my slide five,\n\n321\n00:18:31.387 --> 00:18:34.720\nI don't see that those things\nautomatically included.\n\n322\n00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.934\nWell, you have to go back and add them,\nokay? So I'm gonna click here,\n\n323\n00:18:37.934 --> 00:18:41.075\ngo over here to my Design tab.\n\n324\n00:18:41.075 --> 00:18:45.530\nAnd you can see right over here on the\nleft-hand side, you have Quick Layouts,\n\n325\n00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:49.720\nwhich is nice where it just has those\nkinda quick and easy, here, let me add\n\n326\n00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:54.262\na data table, and I don't have a legend,\nand this one has a legend on the bottom.\n\n327\n00:18:54.262 --> 00:18:59.307\nYou can see if you just hover over\neach one, it's gonna start giving you\n\n328\n00:18:59.307 --> 00:19:05.500\ndifferent collections of elements that\nit's added in these Quick Layouts.\n\n329\n00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.000\nYou could start with one of those, or\n\n330\n00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.760\nyou could go individually and\nadd chart elements as you want.\n\n331\n00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.870\nThe nice thing is it gives you a lot of\npreviews as to what this is going to do\n\n332\n00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.080\nbefore I add it.\n\n333\n00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.074\nSo you could see Axis.\n\n334\n00:19:19.074 --> 00:19:22.731\nOkay, well I do have a primary and\nvertical axis, so that's probably good.\n\n335\n00:19:22.731 --> 00:19:27.218\nAxis Titles,\ndo I want to add just a horizontal title?\n\n336\n00:19:27.218 --> 00:19:29.165\nJust a vertical title?\n\n337\n00:19:29.165 --> 00:19:32.895\nWell, if I wanted both you just\nclick on one, add that in,\n\n338\n00:19:32.895 --> 00:19:35.941\ngo over to Add Chart Element\n&gt; Axis Titles, and\n\n339\n00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:40.893\nyou see that I've already got a horizontal\none because it's got a little grey\n\n340\n00:19:40.893 --> 00:19:45.880\nbox around the left icon of that and\nI do want a vertical axis as well.\n\n341\n00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.637\nAnd you can just keep on going through\neach one of these different chart elements\n\n342\n00:19:50.637 --> 00:19:54.689\nto add what you want to show within\nthis representation of the data.\n\n343\n00:19:54.689 --> 00:19:57.850\nThe data labels,\nthose are the little numbers.\n\n344\n00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.600\nNow, do you want the numbers on the top?\n\n345\n00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.068\nThat was at the end.\n\n346\n00:20:02.068 --> 00:20:03.188\nAt the bottom?\n\n347\n00:20:03.188 --> 00:20:04.277\nOutside?\n\n348\n00:20:04.277 --> 00:20:06.197\nCentered?\n\n349\n00:20:06.197 --> 00:20:07.524\nIt's your choice, okay?\n\n350\n00:20:07.524 --> 00:20:10.264\nLet's go outside end cuz I think\nthat's what I had on the other one.\n\n351\n00:20:10.264 --> 00:20:14.800\nGoing back, Error Bars,\nwe're not really gonna go with that\n\n352\n00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.780\nbecause there really is\nno error in my data.\n\n353\n00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.112\nFuego sleeps a lot and he eats a lot.\n\n354\n00:20:20.112 --> 00:20:22.617\nSo, [LAUGH] there's no error there.\n\n355\n00:20:22.617 --> 00:20:27.480\nBut if you did have, you could go\nahead and choose that to display.\n\n356\n00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.934\nThe grid lines, I don't usually\ngo with a lot of grid lines.\n\n357\n00:20:31.934 --> 00:20:34.057\nI think the ones that they\ndo by default are fine.\n\n358\n00:20:34.057 --> 00:20:37.672\nBut at least you could see\nthat you could add them.\n\n359\n00:20:37.672 --> 00:20:39.453\nAnd then,\nwhere's the position of that legend?\n\n360\n00:20:39.453 --> 00:20:41.490\nDo you want it on the top,\nbottom, left, right?\n\n361\n00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.450\nDo you not want a legend at all?\n\n362\n00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.052\nYou could do that as well.\n\n363\n00:20:45.052 --> 00:20:49.957\nAnd trendlines, that would be if you have,\nmaybe, some line graphs would be\n\n364\n00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:54.048\na little bit more towards what\nyou'd want to add trendlines to.\n\n365\n00:20:54.048 --> 00:20:57.960\nBut you can see all these different\nelements are available in here.\n\n366\n00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.576\nThe data table.\n\n367\n00:20:58.576 --> 00:21:00.283\nI think that was the one I missed.\n\n368\n00:21:00.283 --> 00:21:02.651\nSo I could go ahead and\nadd specific numbers.\n\n369\n00:21:02.651 --> 00:21:06.767\nAnd that would be really good if you're\nwanting to show maybe you have numbers\n\n370\n00:21:06.767 --> 00:21:12.000\nwith decimals, or you wanna show the exact\namount of the sales cuz it's $14,536.26.\n\n371\n00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.066\nYou could do something to that.\n\n372\n00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:19.759\nAnd if in a graphical representation,\na chart,\n\n373\n00:21:19.759 --> 00:21:23.550\nit doesn't show the real number, number.\n\n374\n00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.450\nSo the data tables would\nbe a good reason for\n\n375\n00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.090\nwhy you'd want to do\nthose different items.\n\n376\n00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:32.294\nAnd then, of course, once you add these\ndifferent pieces you can come into,\n\n377\n00:21:32.294 --> 00:21:35.412\nlet me zoom in a little bit,\nbecause I added some titles.\n\n378\n00:21:35.412 --> 00:21:38.159\nSo let's go ahead and add that axis title.\n\n379\n00:21:38.159 --> 00:21:42.906\nAnd I can just select it, and\nthis is the Activities, okay?\n\n380\n00:21:42.906 --> 00:21:46.529\nNotice I did not have to click in it and\nselect it like I did before?\n\n381\n00:21:46.529 --> 00:21:50.273\nIf you have the whole item,\njust start typing, okay?\n\n382\n00:21:50.273 --> 00:21:54.424\nAnd then I could go ahead and get my\nfour-point arrow using that tooltip.\n\n383\n00:21:54.424 --> 00:21:55.713\nYes, I am over the title.\n\n384\n00:21:55.713 --> 00:22:01.290\nI click it, and\nthen I could say Hours a Day.\n\n385\n00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:06.058\nAnd then I've got my axis labels\nready to go, and so on, and so forth.\n\n386\n00:22:06.058 --> 00:22:10.765\nNow, I'm using Styles because,\nto me, it's quick and easy.\n\n387\n00:22:10.765 --> 00:22:13.338\nI go, I'm done, and\nI don't really have to do much.\n\n388\n00:22:13.338 --> 00:22:16.210\nAnd, as you probably know,\nI like the styles.\n\n389\n00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.155\nI think they're nice, and\nI don't really wanna do much more.\n\n390\n00:22:19.155 --> 00:22:23.883\nBut, every single piece is a shape or\nan object that you can\n\n391\n00:22:23.883 --> 00:22:28.900\nformat the same way as if you\nwatched the episodes on shapes and\n\n392\n00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:34.040\nhow we change them to have gradients and\nthe dead fish, right?\n\n393\n00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:34.993\nThe fossils that we applied in there.\n\n394\n00:22:34.993 --> 00:22:39.490\nYou could do the same thing for\nevery single piece in here if you wanted.\n\n395\n00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:42.432\nSo I'm gonna do just one\njust to demonstrate that.\n\n396\n00:22:42.432 --> 00:22:45.421\nI'm gonna take this plot area because\nmy mouse was hovered over here.\n\n397\n00:22:45.421 --> 00:22:46.624\nThere's the plot area.\n\n398\n00:22:46.624 --> 00:22:51.260\nIf I double-click, because that was\nthe old way that you could get into\n\n399\n00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:56.160\nthe format dialogue box, now it just\nbrings the task pane over here.\n\n400\n00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.260\nI can go into the fill and you see you\nhave the same solid gradients pictures and\n\n401\n00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:04.470\nI could put those fossilized fish\nin there if I really wanted to.\n\n402\n00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.420\nAnd, yeah, I think you could already tell.\n\n403\n00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.894\nYou start getting kinda crazy with your\nformats and your charts, it kinda loses\n\n404\n00:23:10.894 --> 00:23:15.250\nits whole purpose, and people are gonna\nbe like, wow, that is a busy chart.\n\n405\n00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:18.265\nAnd it takes away from the whole\nreason why you're putting in charts.\n\n406\n00:23:18.265 --> 00:23:21.591\nIt's to show the data clearly\nof what you're trying to show.\n\n407\n00:23:21.591 --> 00:23:26.294\nSo I would probably tend to stick\nwith some really easy gradients, or\n\n408\n00:23:26.294 --> 00:23:28.250\njust stick with the styles.\n\n409\n00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:32.993\nBut every single piece can be\nformatted because that looks great.\n\n410\n00:23:32.993 --> 00:23:34.840\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n411\n00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:39.330\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and you could do the same thing\nwith all of your shadows and your glows.\n\n412\n00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.684\nIf I wanted to select this data point,\nnotice how I've selected all four.\n\n413\n00:23:42.684 --> 00:23:44.648\nI just single-clicked on it.\n\n414\n00:23:44.648 --> 00:23:51.262\nI could come over here, and we could do a\ngradient fill in there, or a pattern fill.\n\n415\n00:23:51.262 --> 00:23:55.197\nThat is really, really bad.\n\n416\n00:23:55.197 --> 00:23:59.183\nYou're getting the idea, but one thing to\nknow about the data series is that you\n\n417\n00:23:59.183 --> 00:24:01.580\ncan actually select one\nseries individually.\n\n418\n00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.960\nSo let me go over here to Fuego.\n\n419\n00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.770\nIf I single click,\nnotice how one, two, three, four.\n\n420\n00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.440\nAll four data series are selected.\n\n421\n00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.140\nI can see the dots on each one.\n\n422\n00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:16.560\nIf I single clicked one more time, see\nhow I've isolated just that first column.\n\n423\n00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:21.440\nAnd then I apply a gradient here it's\nonly going to one, so just watch that.\n\n424\n00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:26.510\nIf you are formatting data series\nindividually for the different fills and\n\n425\n00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:31.290\neverything, you can deselect all\nof them if you wanna say and\n\n426\n00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.230\njust focus on one of them.\n\n427\n00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:37.810\nWhich can be beneficial, especially if\nyou're doing a pie chart you might wanna\n\n428\n00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:39.590\nmake sure you're like okay, single click.\n\n429\n00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:43.160\nThen single click again to be\nable to isolate that one piece.\n\n430\n00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:44.970\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne.\n\n431\n00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:49.310\nNow taking a look at that on the screen\nthere's this plus sign that looks\n\n432\n00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:52.080\nlike a paintbrush and a funnel.\n\n433\n00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.040\nWhat is that about?\n\n434\n00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, these are new buttons or\nnewer buttons.\n\n435\n00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.440\nI don't remember them in\nolder versions of PowerPoint.\n\n436\n00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:04.340\nThat will allow you to do things like\nformat and the funnel, it's like a filter.\n\n437\n00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:05.770\nLike filtering your data.\n\n438\n00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:10.900\nSo remember how we said,\nwhy I didn't wanna have four categories or\n\n439\n00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.110\nthree categories and\nI didn't wanna have three series.\n\n440\n00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:15.109\nRight?\nWe didn't have three cast.\n\n441\n00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:20.390\nI'm gonna close this task pane,\nyou could go ahead and click on that and\n\n442\n00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.900\nwhat it does is it brings up,\nwell these are the different pieces.\n\n443\n00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.920\nWell, what if you didn't\nwant to show this?\n\n444\n00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.795\nI don't wanna show Meow.\n\n445\n00:25:27.795 --> 00:25:30.935\nWell, I can uncheck it and then apply.\n\n446\n00:25:30.935 --> 00:25:35.605\nAnd then it's only going to display sleep,\neat, and play.\n\n447\n00:25:35.605 --> 00:25:38.635\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; And if only wanted to compare Fuego and\n\n448\n00:25:38.635 --> 00:25:40.225\nnot Bishop, I can uncheck that.\n\n449\n00:25:40.225 --> 00:25:41.790\nYou always gotta click the apply button.\n\n450\n00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:44.115\nCuz people will check and\nlike, it's not doing anything.\n\n451\n00:25:44.115 --> 00:25:46.075\nBut you gotta apply the changes.\n\n452\n00:25:46.075 --> 00:25:47.575\nIt's really, it's almost like hiding.\n\n453\n00:25:47.575 --> 00:25:49.475\nIt's just hiding that information.\n\n454\n00:25:49.475 --> 00:25:53.942\nIt's not deleting it like we had done in\nthe chart data, but it is just hiding.\n\n455\n00:25:53.942 --> 00:25:55.610\nSo it's nice.\n\n456\n00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:58.400\nl really do like that if\nyou wanted a quick and\n\n457\n00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.230\neasy way to just say filter out\nthe data that l want to show.\n\n458\n00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:07.090\nAnd then the paint brush would\nbe how you can add those styles.\n\n459\n00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:10.860\nAll the things we see in the design tab on\nthe ribbon, you could go through and start\n\n460\n00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.850\nchanging some of these like maybe the\noverall color scheme that l want to use.\n\n461\n00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:16.660\nNow I've still have got\nthat yellow background, so\n\n462\n00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.230\nit's not looking so fantastic right now.\n\n463\n00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.490\nBut those are nice little quick and\neasy buttons, and\n\n464\n00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:26.530\nthen the little plus sign would\nbe your different chart elements.\n\n465\n00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:28.140\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; That we had done through the ribbon,\n\n466\n00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.790\nbut it's just another way\nbecause there's always\n\n467\n00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:32.970\nlike 15 ways to do\nsomething in PowerPoint.\n\n468\n00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:38.430\nIt's just adding you another place\nto go for those little buttons.\n\n469\n00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:43.790\nNow coming back to the data, hiding\nsome I didn't wanna compare the Meow.\n\n470\n00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:49.540\nAnd sorry I have to do this, I have to\ngo ahead and take this fill off of that.\n\n471\n00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.410\nCome on stop, okay come here.\n\n472\n00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:54.360\nAll right there we go.\n\n473\n00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:58.190\nThe no fill would then just go back to\nwhatever the chart style is going to be.\n\n474\n00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:01.470\nAnd sorry, that was a little jarring,\nI don't know if anybody else is like\n\n475\n00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.290\nplease just turn it off,\ngive me some sunglasses.\n\n476\n00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.410\nSo I wanted to at least format\nthat plot area to take it off.\n\n477\n00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:13.270\nSo data, what if we made a mistake and\nFuego is not sleeping as much anymore?\n\n478\n00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:15.410\nOr he's playing more?\n\n479\n00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.020\nSomething to that effect,\nI need to edit that data.\n\n480\n00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:21.460\nThat's where you can go\nto the edit data button.\n\n481\n00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:26.570\nAnd then it just brings up that little\nwindow in an Excel like format,\n\n482\n00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:27.842\nand then I can change it.\n\n483\n00:27:27.842 --> 00:27:35.320\nBecause maybe Bishop plays two hours and\nmeows six hours, eight hours?\n\n484\n00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.200\nWhere are we at?\n\n485\n00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.190\nMath.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n486\n00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:39.375\n&gt;&gt; We'll go with eight.\n\n487\n00:27:39.375 --> 00:27:41.010\n[LAUGH] So we could go ahead.\n\n488\n00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:41.830\nAnd is that 24?\n\n489\n00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:42.470\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n490\n00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:44.023\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\nI was hoping that was right.\n\n491\n00:27:44.023 --> 00:27:46.610\n[LAUGH] So I went ahead and\nchanged my data.\n\n492\n00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:50.510\nAnd if I close this,\nnow you can see that it didn't change.\n\n493\n00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:52.280\nWhy did it not change?\n\n494\n00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:58.110\nThere we go.\nRemember that weird glitch I was having?\n\n495\n00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:01.680\nIt didn't actually close PowerPoint\nit just didn't display properly.\n\n496\n00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.790\nSo all right, that was a me thing.\n\n497\n00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:05.960\nIt should work fine with you.\n\n498\n00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.240\nAnd the other thing I\nwanted to show you here is,\n\n499\n00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.640\nwhat if I wanted to change the chart type?\n\n500\n00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.020\nWe had talked about that I\nwanted a clustered column.\n\n501\n00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:16.860\nWith out the 3D effect,\nwell maybe I want the 3D effect now.\n\n502\n00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.440\nChange chart type,\nwe have our button right there.\n\n503\n00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.860\nAnd then you could go in to\nadding a 3D clustered column,\n\n504\n00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.820\nand then it would look\nsomething like this.\n\n505\n00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.700\nMaybe I want to change it to a line chart,\nor a line graph.\n\n506\n00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:35.730\nOkay well this doesn't\nreally represent the data\n\n507\n00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:40.730\nI feel in cat activity, but\nI could change it if I wanted to.\n\n508\n00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:43.830\nAnd I could do the bar charts and\nso on and so forth.\n\n509\n00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:48.820\nBut you could go ahead and change your\nchart types really quickly by going into\n\n510\n00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.460\nyour contextual tabs on your ribbon.\n\n511\n00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.650\nLet's go ahead and switch that back.\n\n512\n00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:58.670\nThe other thing was what if I\nwanted to switch my axis basically.\n\n513\n00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:02.890\nSo I want to have the activities\nas the legend, and Fuego and\n\n514\n00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:05.630\nBishop along the category axis.\n\n515\n00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:09.160\nWhere it says select data, now notice\nit doesn't switch row and column,\n\n516\n00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.950\nit's not selected right now.\n\n517\n00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:12.460\nThat's okay, cuz if it's not,\n\n518\n00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:17.058\nif it's grayed out there is a way that you\ncan do it if where if you go to select\n\n519\n00:29:17.058 --> 00:29:22.050\ndata it brings up this extra window\nwhere it says select data source.\n\n520\n00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:26.180\nAnd you see right there where\nit says switch row and column.\n\n521\n00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.940\nSo if it doesn't give it to you by\ndefault, just go into there and\n\n522\n00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.757\nthen force it to say I\nwanna turn this around.\n\n523\n00:29:31.757 --> 00:29:35.803\nAnd if anybody's coming from\nolder versions of Excel,\n\n524\n00:29:35.803 --> 00:29:38.940\nto me this is like an old school box.\n\n525\n00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.620\nIt reminds me of the older\nways that you had to do, and\n\n526\n00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.060\nyou had to this kind\nof know what this was.\n\n527\n00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.982\nAnd it didn't really\ngive you that preview,\n\n528\n00:29:45.982 --> 00:29:47.950\nbefore you put all the information in.\n\n529\n00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:50.480\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead, and\nclick okay and you can see.\n\n530\n00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:56.230\nThat now it's switch to where we're\nhaving Fuego as the category and\n\n531\n00:29:56.230 --> 00:30:02.230\nthe activities as the legends and\nthe data series that we're going across.\n\n532\n00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:03.680\nAnd so that's how you can change that.\n\n533\n00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.710\nI'm gonna close this, yep,\nsee it did that little glitch thing again.\n\n534\n00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.280\nThat's okay, and\nthen we come back to our chart and\n\n535\n00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.260\nwe can keep on formatting\nif you wanted to.\n\n536\n00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:15.370\nIf you go over to the format,\nthat's where if you did want to go and\n\n537\n00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:21.668\nformat each individual item you could,\nas we displayed in the beginning.\n\n538\n00:30:21.668 --> 00:30:28.100\nBut I think that covers just about\neverything in inserting charts.\n\n539\n00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:28.940\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne.\n\n540\n00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.870\nWell, thank you again for helping us out,\n\n541\n00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:34.600\nin terms of taking a look at using\ncharts inside of PowerPoint.\n\n542\n00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.300\nRemember that when we want to be able\nto display a tremendous amount of\n\n543\n00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.910\ninformation, charts are really good\nin helping us to display summaries or\n\n544\n00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.940\ntrends or\nbe able to actually show percentages too.\n\n545\n00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:48.080\nSo depending on what we actually need to\nshow, PowerPoint gives us the way to do\n\n546\n00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:52.120\nthat without having to bring in another\nelement to add in the PowerPoint.\n\n547\n00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.110\nSo as long as we can get the data into\na format that PowerPoint can recognize\n\n548\n00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.720\nit can then apply all\nthe different formatting.\n\n549\n00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.430\nWe can change it to make\nthe presentation and\n\n550\n00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.620\nthe impact that we want\nit to make as well.\n\n551\n00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:07.030\nThank you again, Vonne, for helping us\nto take a look at inserting charts.\n\n552\n00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.710\nAnd thank you also for watching.\n\n553\n00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.870\nIt's a great place for\nus to go ahead and sign off.\n\n554\n00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.540\nFor IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n555\n00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:14.520\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n556\n00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:18.562\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Microsoft PowerPoint 2016.\n\n557\n00:31:18.562 --> 00:31:28.562\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Good, I'm glad to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.186\nI'm excited to get moving in PowerPoint,\nyou see what I did there?\n\n15\n00:00:35.186 --> 00:00:35.960\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n16\n00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.380\nI'm going to be animating our\nslide content in PowerPoint.\n\n17\n00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.813\nSo, animation is exactly what\nyou think it sounds like,\n\n18\n00:00:42.813 --> 00:00:47.605\nwe're going to animate objects or text or\nanything that's on our slides to make\n\n19\n00:00:47.605 --> 00:00:51.320\nit a little bit more fun,\nget a little bit more possessed, and\n\n20\n00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.080\njust see how our PowerPoint presentation\ncould get a little more lively.\n\n21\n00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that, cuz when you think\nof PowerPoint, you think a very static,\n\n22\n00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.600\nhere is some bullet points,\nwe're gonna talk about this but,\n\n23\n00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.920\nif I can make things move around,\nput a little animation in there.\n\n24\n00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.590\nLike you said, I can kinda bring some life\ninto my PowerPoint presentation which is\n\n25\n00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.320\ngonna keep the people from going to sleep\nwhile you're giving your presentation.\n\n26\n00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.070\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nit can help you control the pace\n\n27\n00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.850\nof the content that you want\nto present in your slides.\n\n28\n00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.791\nNow of course with anything,\nyou go overboard it,\n\n29\n00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:21.339\ncan get a little obnoxious, I'm sure.\n\n30\n00:01:21.339 --> 00:01:22.312\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n31\n00:01:22.312 --> 00:01:25.510\nalways thinking about\nyour target audience.\n\n32\n00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.380\nWho is this presentation meant for?\n\n33\n00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.400\nIf you're going for\nmiddle school children, well,\n\n34\n00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.320\nthey might think it might\nbe little too much,\n\n35\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.430\nbut, how about elementary school\nchildren or kindergartens?\n\n36\n00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.698\nThey would love animation.\n\n37\n00:01:36.698 --> 00:01:41.339\nBut if you're giving a presentation to the\nboardroom, you might wanna do some subtle\n\n38\n00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:45.272\nanimation and be able to have that kind\nof move the presentation along and\n\n39\n00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:48.654\nnot make them go, whoa,\nthat's too much, you need to stop.\n\n40\n00:01:48.654 --> 00:01:51.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So what are really animating then?\n\n41\n00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.950\nCuz it's not like we're making\na flash movie or a cartoon or\n\n42\n00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.470\nanything like that, I mean,\nwhat are we animating within PowerPoint?\n\n43\n00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.738\n&gt;&gt; Well, why don't we go ahead and\njump into it and\n\n44\n00:01:59.738 --> 00:02:02.424\nI can show you some different\nthings that we can do in it.\n\n45\n00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:06.900\nSo, I have a PowerPoint presentation\nalready created called animations.\n\n46\n00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.764\nAnd, it's going to go head and\n\n47\n00:02:08.764 --> 00:02:12.217\nopen up with a design template\nthat's already applied.\n\n48\n00:02:12.217 --> 00:02:15.991\nAnd I have some of the slides that you've\nbeen seeing, some of the content that\n\n49\n00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:19.652\nwe've been doing throughout the entire\nshow with our Alice in Wonderland,\n\n50\n00:02:19.652 --> 00:02:23.596\nif you haven't caught along to that, with\nthe rabbits and the pigs and peppers and\n\n51\n00:02:23.596 --> 00:02:26.490\nthings like that in a different\nslide layouts that we have.\n\n52\n00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.339\nAnd along the way, I've made some notes in\nthe upper-right hand corner to give us,\n\n53\n00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:35.535\nto help me guide you along and\nhow we can go ahead and add our animation.\n\n54\n00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:39.752\nSo, why don't we start at the very\nbeginning on slide two of our just basic\n\n55\n00:02:39.752 --> 00:02:40.508\nanimation?\n\n56\n00:02:40.508 --> 00:02:44.580\nAnd you've actually seen some of these\nif you've watched the introduction to\n\n57\n00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.921\nPowerPoint when we were doing\nwith Fuego and Bishop, the cats.\n\n58\n00:02:47.921 --> 00:02:52.140\nI decided to take a break from them,\nand give you some other information.\n\n59\n00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.955\nI still have a cat in there, so.\n\n60\n00:02:53.955 --> 00:02:55.212\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Of course.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Can't get away from that one.\n\n61\n00:02:55.212 --> 00:02:59.685\nAll right, so if I was going to play\nthis slide from this particular slide,\n\n62\n00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:03.320\nlet's just demonstrate\nwhat this would look like.\n\n63\n00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.400\nAll the informations up\non the site at one time.\n\n64\n00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.840\nWell, if I want to bring in points,\n\n65\n00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.400\nlike if I'm gonna talk about\nthe Pool of Tears for a little bit,\n\n66\n00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.930\nit might be awhile before I get back\ndown to the Caucus Race and a Long Tale.\n\n67\n00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.077\nI wanna stay on that point for a while.\n\n68\n00:03:18.077 --> 00:03:21.868\nWell, I don't want you reading it cuz\nyou're probably doing it right now as I'm\n\n69\n00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:24.572\nspeaking, you're reading\nthis slide as I'm talking.\n\n70\n00:03:24.572 --> 00:03:28.336\nYou don't want to have them do that,\nyou want them to focus on you,\n\n71\n00:03:28.336 --> 00:03:30.630\nso how can I control the content?\n\n72\n00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.427\nI could have it zoom in or fly in or\nwhichever way, one by one.\n\n73\n00:03:34.427 --> 00:03:35.363\nSo let me show you how to do that.\n\n74\n00:03:35.363 --> 00:03:39.402\nI'm on the slide, now, if you go over\nto the Animations tab on your ribbon,\n\n75\n00:03:39.402 --> 00:03:41.946\nyou can see everything\nis grayed out right now.\n\n76\n00:03:41.946 --> 00:03:44.578\nThe reason it's grayed out,\nyou don't have anything selected,\n\n77\n00:03:44.578 --> 00:03:46.750\nit doesn't know what you want to animate.\n\n78\n00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.130\nSo, I have to is click somewhere\nin that particular placeholder.\n\n79\n00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.410\nNow, because I have these bulleted\nlist and I have, what do we got,\n\n80\n00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.910\nseven items, it's going to automatically\nwith bulleted list text pick that,\n\n81\n00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.950\nwhen you put the animations on it,\nit's just gonna come in one by one.\n\n82\n00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.040\nSo I'm gonna do a basic one.\n\n83\n00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.729\nLet's go in with a Fly and\nyou can see that's green,\n\n84\n00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:10.357\nthe reason why it's green is cuz\nit's an entrance type of animation.\n\n85\n00:04:10.357 --> 00:04:13.080\nWe're gonna start with those types first.\n\n86\n00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.170\nSo I click Fly In, you can see boom,\nboom, boom, boom, boom.\n\n87\n00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.170\nIt's showing me that this\nwhat it's going to look like.\n\n88\n00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.815\nAnd then it labels by\neach item the number or\n\n89\n00:04:21.815 --> 00:04:24.539\nthe order in which\nthat's going to come in.\n\n90\n00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.138\nNow that does mean that,\nevery animation or\n\n91\n00:04:27.138 --> 00:04:31.440\nevery bullet point that I wanna pull up,\nI would have to click on.\n\n92\n00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.042\nAnd you can see over here on\nthe right-hand side on the ribbon it says,\n\n93\n00:04:35.042 --> 00:04:36.155\nStart When Clicked.\n\n94\n00:04:36.155 --> 00:04:38.080\nSo, that's good to know.\n\n95\n00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.850\nI mean, we could go ahead and\ncontrol that, but\n\n96\n00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.990\nI'll show you that in some later\nslides and different examples.\n\n97\n00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.100\nAnd you have over here on the left-hand\nside that you could preview this\n\n98\n00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.360\nto see this is exactly\nwhat's going to happen.\n\n99\n00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.997\nSo when I run the slide, so I can give\nyou that demonstration in real-time,\n\n100\n00:04:53.997 --> 00:04:55.095\nif you wanna say.\n\n101\n00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:58.220\nWe'll go ahead and do from current slide,\nand now you can see that, if I'm\n\n102\n00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.330\npresenting, I'm like, all right everybody,\nI want to talk about basic animation.\n\n103\n00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.310\nEverybody's looking at me and\nnot reading the slide.\n\n104\n00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.090\nSo, if I'm ready to talk about the next\npoint which is, let's talk about,\n\n105\n00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.780\nDown the Rabbit Hole and\nyou da, da, da, da, da, and\n\n106\n00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.230\nyou go on with what you want to talk\nabout with this particular point.\n\n107\n00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.890\nAnd the next one you wanna bring in, you\nclick, and it brings in the next one, and\n\n108\n00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.060\nyou click, and you click.\n\n109\n00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.670\nSo you can see, it's controlling\nthe pace of how you want to present,\n\n110\n00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.480\nwhich is quite helpful.\n\n111\n00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.750\n&gt;&gt; That's really impressive,\nand it's a pretty cool concept,\n\n112\n00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.300\ncuz you're, when you first\nstart to think about animation,\n\n113\n00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.270\nyou think, we're doing it just to\nmake it look pretty and have fun.\n\n114\n00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.710\nBut you are using the animation\nto control how the viewers or\n\n115\n00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.740\nyour audience are perceiving\nthat information.\n\n116\n00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.770\nI can sit on this one bullet point for\nas long as I need to, and\n\n117\n00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.530\nmake sure they're not going on, so-\n&gt;&gt;

So you can add just as\nmany animations as you want.\n\n244\n00:12:46.045 --> 00:12:46.950\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yes.\n\n245\n00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.786\nI can have it spin.\n\n246\n00:12:48.786 --> 00:12:50.412\nAnd then I can have it bounce around.\n\n247\n00:12:50.412 --> 00:12:53.452\nAnd then I can have it do\na couple other things and\n\n248\n00:12:53.452 --> 00:12:57.290\nthat's why you see how it's like red,\nyellow, green.\n\n249\n00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:01.352\nThey have a you know how it comes\nin how you can emphasize it,\n\n250\n00:13:01.352 --> 00:13:06.241\nbut does that mean that you have to\ndo the entrance before the emphasis.\n\n251\n00:13:06.241 --> 00:13:10.930\nNo, you don't have to do that because\nmaybe you had this on the screen.\n\n252\n00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:15.770\nWhen you're talking about\nthe field of red flowers,\n\n253\n00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.230\nI'm totally making this up right now,\nand it's not doing a very good job.\n\n254\n00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:23.140\nBut you wanted to just make it do a little\ndance, in the middle of your presentation\n\n255\n00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:27.380\nyou can add that emphasis as\nthe only animation you have.\n\n256\n00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.228\nYou don't have to start with\nan entrance just so you know.\n\n257\n00:13:30.228 --> 00:13:35.211\nBut the effects, sorry, the animations\nare on a click so let me go ahead and\n\n258\n00:13:35.211 --> 00:13:39.501\nplay the from the current side so\nI will have to remember, okay.\n\n259\n00:13:39.501 --> 00:13:43.259\nIt's coming in and if I'm not remembering,\nI'm just going along with my presentation\n\n260\n00:13:43.259 --> 00:13:46.400\nand I'm look wait I'm\nsupposed to I gotta click.\n\n261\n00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.580\nAnd then it goes ahead and spins.\n\n262\n00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.270\nAnd then I have to click\nagain to make it go away.\n\n263\n00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:56.530\nWhat if I wanted to have all of\nthose things happen automatically.\n\n264\n00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:00.520\nI know if I click the mouse,\nthat it's gonna come in, spin and go out.\n\n265\n00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.403\nAnd then I don't have to remember to\nclick to have that next animation happen.\n\n266\n00:14:05.403 --> 00:14:10.620\nSo, we're going to control how\nthe animations follow each other.\n\n267\n00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.530\nSo, I'm gonna click on\nthe object over here.\n\n268\n00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:17.830\nWe have one, two, three, and each of them\nyou can see that, I'm on the wrong tab,\n\n269\n00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.625\nthat's why it's not showing up.\n\n270\n00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:25.310\n[LAUGH] On the animation it says when\nclicked, when clicked, when clicked.\n\n271\n00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.171\nSo if I click on the second one,\n\n272\n00:14:27.171 --> 00:14:30.687\nbecause I do want the first one\nto happen when I click on it.\n\n273\n00:14:30.687 --> 00:14:34.090\nCuz I do want to be able\nto control when it starts.\n\n274\n00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:35.770\nSo I'll keep that one there, but\n\n275\n00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:42.160\nthe second animation needs to happen\nright after the previous one.\n\n276\n00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:47.440\nSo you can either come up here to\nthe ribbon and you can see after previous.\n\n277\n00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.290\nOr you can come over here to\nthe little drop down on the right\n\n278\n00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:56.920\nhand side of the animation pane,\nand say start after previous.\n\n279\n00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.760\nSo that way in it saying it's\ngonna happen right after.\n\n280\n00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.720\nYou see how the little\nbox goes underneath it.\n\n281\n00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.940\nSo there's multiple things\nthat's gonna happen once\n\n282\n00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.532\nthat first click of the animation happens.\n\n283\n00:15:09.532 --> 00:15:13.847\nAnd so I would like to have the exit do\nthe same thing, so click on the exit.\n\n284\n00:15:13.847 --> 00:15:17.050\nI will click the drop down,\nand say start after previous.\n\n285\n00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:20.000\nSo now you can see the preview.\n\n286\n00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.920\nIt's gonna do the same\nthing as it did before,\n\n287\n00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.920\nbut now it's all within one trigger.\n\n288\n00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.412\nSo let's go ahead and\nshow this from the slide.\n\n289\n00:15:27.412 --> 00:15:29.950\nAll right, so ready?\n\n290\n00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:31.507\n&gt;&gt; You have to say, look Mondo no hands.\n\n291\n00:15:31.507 --> 00:15:32.896\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n292\n00:15:32.896 --> 00:15:34.480\nSo now I'm going to click.\n\n293\n00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.240\nAnd now it's going to do is think and\ngo on out.\n\n294\n00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:39.740\nSo.\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n295\n00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.039\n&gt;&gt; You can trigger,\n\n296\n00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:46.236\nyou can have those different triggers\nof how the effects will happen and\n\n297\n00:15:46.236 --> 00:15:51.085\nwhile we're on that kind of\ncontrolling how this animation goes,\n\n298\n00:15:51.085 --> 00:15:55.674\nyou see this progression of how long,\nlike how long it takes for\n\n299\n00:15:55.674 --> 00:15:57.587\nit to Fly in.\nAnd there's like,\n\n300\n00:15:57.587 --> 00:15:59.408\nit's almost like a little timeline and\n\n301\n00:15:59.408 --> 00:16:03.070\nit says it's gonna fly in.\nThat spin does take a little bit longer\n\n302\n00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.460\nthan the exit.\n\n303\n00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.140\nSo those kinda blocks,\n\n304\n00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:11.050\nthose colored blocks, are indicating the\nduration of how long each animation takes.\n\n305\n00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.690\nWell, what if I wanted it to\nbe a little more dramatic?\n\n306\n00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:19.130\nI want it to rise up from the stage a\nlittle slower, or make it a little longer.\n\n307\n00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.970\nYou can take, there's a couple ways, but\nthe first way you could do it is if you\n\n308\n00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:28.600\nget the two pointed arrows on the duration\nblock, you can just extend this out.\n\n309\n00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.150\nAnd you can see that it's going\nto take a little bit longer.\n\n310\n00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.660\nI'm gonna go ahead and preview that.\n\n311\n00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.740\nI'm still in the wrong tab.\n\n312\n00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.265\nI keep doing that.\n\n313\n00:16:36.265 --> 00:16:40.190\nSo, you can see that it's going to\ntake a little bit longer to come up.\n\n314\n00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:43.740\nAnd if I wanted to I could go ahead and\nslow down the exit as well.\n\n315\n00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.720\n&gt;&gt; And it looks like when you extended\nthat first animation it just took\n\n316\n00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.130\nthe other two animations and\nmoved them further down the timeline.\n\n317\n00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.610\nSo you didn't have to readjust those.\n\n318\n00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.640\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and especially since we have\nit starting after previous, it's like,\n\n319\n00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.590\nwe'll, as soon as the one\nbefore me is done then I go.\n\n320\n00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.620\nSo, that's a little help there.\n\n321\n00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.820\nAnd if you wanted to change, maybe you\nwant it to spin a little bit longer,\n\n322\n00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.080\nI can go ahead and use it from the ribbon.\n\n323\n00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:12.220\nI was using the drag method\nof just extending the shapes,\n\n324\n00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.010\nI guess you could say,\nin the animation pane.\n\n325\n00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:17.030\nBut if I have specific amount of time,\nI could go ahead and\n\n326\n00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:21.490\ntype this in, that I want it to take\nthree seconds instead of two seconds.\n\n327\n00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.745\nAnd you can see that it's\ngoing to adjust here, as well.\n\n328\n00:17:24.745 --> 00:17:25.615\nSo I can make that happen.\n\n329\n00:17:25.615 --> 00:17:27.655\nAnd you can also put a delay on that.\n\n330\n00:17:27.655 --> 00:17:33.520\nIf I wanted the exit to just delay\na little bit after the spinning happens,\n\n331\n00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.697\nI could go ahead and\nmaybe delay that for one second.\n\n332\n00:17:37.697 --> 00:17:40.095\nAnd you can see that it will go ahead and\ncome in.\n\n333\n00:17:40.095 --> 00:17:44.780\nIt will do a little spin,\nit will take a small pause, and\n\n334\n00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.610\nthen it will go ahead and exit, okay?\n\n335\n00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:51.420\nSo, those durations and delays can\nhelp you control how those animations,\n\n336\n00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:57.260\nespecially if you have them in sequential\norder of happening one after the other,\n\n337\n00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.560\nand you can control that pace.\n\n338\n00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.240\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, Vonne.\n\n339\n00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.100\nReally cool animations, but so\n\n340\n00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.160\nfar we've got one animation, then\nthe next animation, and then the next.\n\n341\n00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.730\nWhat if I wanted it to spin as it flew in,\ncan we do that?\n\n342\n00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:11.810\n&gt;&gt; We can.\n\n343\n00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.030\nWe can get fancy like that.\n\n344\n00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:18.330\nThe reason why the spinning\nwas happening after\n\n345\n00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:23.540\nthe entrance is because I told\nit to start after previous.\n\n346\n00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.060\nSo you have to do one, then the next.\n\n347\n00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.210\nBut if we had changed this, so\n\n348\n00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:35.060\nI'm gonna come back over here to\nour second emphasis animation.\n\n349\n00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:39.680\nInstead of starting after previous,\nI can have it with previous.\n\n350\n00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.580\nAnd if I say with previous, do you see\nhow the little yellow box moves over?\n\n351\n00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.920\nSo that way, on the timeline\nthat is going to come in and\n\n352\n00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.870\nemphasize itself at the same time.\n\n353\n00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:52.614\nSo let's preview this, and there you go.\n\n354\n00:18:52.614 --> 00:18:54.980\n&gt;&gt; Nice, that's fancy.\n\n355\n00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.250\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n[LAUGH] Awesome.\n\n356\n00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:00.720\nYes, so to start with previous\nversus after previous\n\n357\n00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.090\nis a way that you can\ncontrol that animation.\n\n358\n00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.480\nAnd you can get pretty fancy.\n\n359\n00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.490\nI've seen some PowerPoint presentations,\nI'm like that's amazing animation.\n\n360\n00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:10.315\nI wanna see their timeline.\n\n361\n00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:11.950\n[LAUGH] Just like, how did they do that?\n\n362\n00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:12.820\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\n\n363\n00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.630\nspeaking of getting crazy like this,\n\n364\n00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:18.440\nyou did mentioned something about\na dancing cat, and this I'm dying to see.\n\n365\n00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.880\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so those are what are known\nas motion paths So let's go ahead and\n\n366\n00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.314\nget to our slide five and\nlike here, kitty, kitty.\n\n367\n00:19:25.314 --> 00:19:31.950\n[LAUGH] So I have the cat, and maybe I\nwant the cat to, I keep doing fly in.\n\n368\n00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:33.290\nBut maybe we'll just have it appear.\n\n369\n00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.260\nSo here's the cat, that was really quick.\n\n370\n00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.320\nBut we could extend that out.\n\n371\n00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.880\nIt shows up.\n\n372\n00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.190\nAnd you know how cats, before they\nstart moving, they do a little wiggle?\n\n373\n00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.840\nOkay, so why don't we have it teeter?\n\n374\n00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.860\nRight, so it's getting ready to go.\n\n375\n00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.388\nAnd then it's gonna moop,\nwait, you know what I did?\n\n376\n00:19:51.388 --> 00:19:53.892\n&gt;&gt; What'd you do?\n&gt;&gt; I forgot to add.\n\n377\n00:19:53.892 --> 00:19:54.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You replaced again.\n\n378\n00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.446\n&gt;&gt; See, I get so\nexcited that I forget to it add it.\n\n379\n00:19:57.446 --> 00:19:58.916\nOkay, sorry, I didn't undo.\n\n380\n00:19:58.916 --> 00:19:59.896\nSo it's coming in.\n\n381\n00:19:59.896 --> 00:20:01.366\nWe're gonna add the teeter.\n\n382\n00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:02.580\nThere we go.\n\n383\n00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.870\nI realized when I looked over my\nanimation pane I only have one.\n\n384\n00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:07.580\nYeah, I replaced it, okay.\n\n385\n00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.470\nNow, we're going to add a motion path.\n\n386\n00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:12.650\nSo I'm gonna scroll on down here.\n\n387\n00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:17.450\nAnd you see that they already have\nsome pre-built motion paths here.\n\n388\n00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:21.920\nBut we've got line and arc, but\nI want it to kinda jump up and down.\n\n389\n00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.930\nSo you have an option for\nmore motion paths.\n\n390\n00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:28.040\nAnd you can see,\nthey have the more entrance emphasis and\n\n391\n00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.730\nexit effects as well if you\nwanted to go into that.\n\n392\n00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.874\nSo if I go ahead and\nclick on more motion paths,\n\n393\n00:20:32.874 --> 00:20:36.260\nyou have all sorts of different\nshapes that it could go around.\n\n394\n00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.260\nYou can make stars and zigzags, but\n\n395\n00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.530\nI think that's the one I'm actually\nlooking for is the zigzag.\n\n396\n00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.600\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and say OK.\n\n397\n00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.700\nClick it first, there we go.\n\n398\n00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.480\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\nclick OK.\n\n399\n00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.657\nAnd you can see that see that,\nit jumps around.\n\n400\n00:20:50.657 --> 00:20:51.615\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n401\n00:20:51.615 --> 00:20:53.935\nit only goes a very short distance,\ndoes it?\n\n402\n00:20:53.935 --> 00:20:56.205\nI want it to jump all\nthe way across the stage.\n\n403\n00:20:56.205 --> 00:21:02.819\nSo you can see down here on the slide,\nit has the motion path selected right now,\n\n404\n00:21:02.819 --> 00:21:07.285\nand then we're going to go ahead and\nextend this out.\n\n405\n00:21:07.285 --> 00:21:09.792\nAnd I have it go all the way\noff the side of the slide.\n\n406\n00:21:09.792 --> 00:21:17.350\nAnd so now the cat will teeter a little\nbit and then jump all the way across.\n\n407\n00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n408\n00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:20.450\n&gt;&gt; A little fun with our cats.\n\n409\n00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.060\nSo, again, I'm not sure if you wanna\n\n410\n00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.050\ndo this to the CEOs and\nthe CFOs of your company,\n\n411\n00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.390\nbut it could have it's\nplace in certain places.\n\n412\n00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:28.660\n&gt;&gt; That was gonna be my next question.\n\n413\n00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.910\nLet's say we made this presentation and\n\n414\n00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:34.940\nwe used it with a certain audience\nwhere these animations are really cool.\n\n415\n00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:39.000\nBut now I need to present\nthis to the C level execs,\n\n416\n00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.730\nand I don't really want the cat\nto be bouncing across the screen.\n\n417\n00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.860\nDo I have to start all over or\ncan I get rid of those animations?\n\n418\n00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:51.680\n&gt;&gt; No, you can, and so let's just say that\nwe'll have one slide that has animation.\n\n419\n00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.460\nAnd from the beginning\nin our introduction,\n\n420\n00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.950\nI know that there's animation on\nthe slide because of the star.\n\n421\n00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:58.675\nI hadn't pointed that out until just now.\n\n422\n00:21:58.675 --> 00:22:02.410\nBut yes,\nthe star indicates some type of animation.\n\n423\n00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:05.230\nIt could be a slide transition,\nbut it's some type of animation.\n\n424\n00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.360\nWe'll have slide transitions\nin the next episode.\n\n425\n00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.520\nSo, I'm gonna take this cat,\nhere on slide five.\n\n426\n00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.730\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncopy it Come over here to slide six.\n\n427\n00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.540\nAnd then I'm gonna go ahead and paste it.\n\n428\n00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:21.080\nAnd it will retain all of the animation\nbecause that animation's attached\n\n429\n00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.480\nto that object.\n\n430\n00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.350\nWell, if I wanna get rid of the animation,\nthe easiest way is to just come\n\n431\n00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:28.690\nover here to the Animation pane,\nand just tell it to remove.\n\n432\n00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.900\nNow, I had all three of those selected.\n\n433\n00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.390\nHere, let me do that again, really quick.\n\n434\n00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.770\nSo I had all three of\nthem already highlighted.\n\n435\n00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:38.940\nSo when I right-clicked, or\nclicked the little drop down, either one.\n\n436\n00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:44.460\nI can say remove the animation from here,\nand then it goes away.\n\n437\n00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.800\nNow, if you had them individually, you\nwould have to then just remove each one.\n\n438\n00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:52.180\nSo it's actually easier to use that Shift\nkey and select multiples and arrange.\n\n439\n00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:57.680\nAnd then go ahead and remove them there,\nand then it goes away.\n\n440\n00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.820\nSo that's an easy way to remove.\n\n441\n00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.992\nNow, one last thing I want to point out\nabout the motion path is that what if l\n\n442\n00:23:03.992 --> 00:23:08.378\nwanted to cat to, back on slide five,\nhe wanted to make like a really big jump?\n\n443\n00:23:08.378 --> 00:23:12.088\nMaybe l can put a little picture\nof a mouse or, well, actually,\n\n444\n00:23:12.088 --> 00:23:14.150\nthey wouldn’t be jumping over.\n\n445\n00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:15.968\nThey'd probably jumped on it.\n\n446\n00:23:15.968 --> 00:23:18.643\nOr some type of something that-\n&gt;&gt; If there's a dog there-\n\n447\n00:23:18.643 --> 00:23:19.240\n&gt;&gt; There we go, exactly.\n\n448\n00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.160\nIt’s gotta jump over the dog.\n\n449\n00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:24.140\nYou can edit the points on a motion path.\n\n450\n00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.770\nSo, I’m going to select the motion path.\n\n451\n00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.270\nAnd you know I’m selecting cuz\nI have that four-pointed arrow.\n\n452\n00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:30.600\nI can go ahead and click on that.\n\n453\n00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:38.003\nAnd if you right-click over that selected\nmotion path, you can go to edit points.\n\n454\n00:23:38.003 --> 00:23:40.665\nAnd when I go to edit points,\nit says exactly that.\n\n455\n00:23:40.665 --> 00:23:44.896\nI can take each one of these individual\npoints of where it's going up and\n\n456\n00:23:44.896 --> 00:23:48.983\nthen down and then up and down And\nthen I could go ahead and move them and\n\n457\n00:23:48.983 --> 00:23:53.778\nthey actually have the bezier handles that\nwe talked about in the shape episode,\n\n458\n00:23:53.778 --> 00:23:56.360\nwhere we didn't go too crazy into it.\n\n459\n00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.220\nIt basically makes it\nto where it can curve,\n\n460\n00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.402\nit's how paths come in and out of points.\n\n461\n00:24:01.402 --> 00:24:03.510\nEasiest is way just grab and\nstart moving around.\n\n462\n00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:05.860\nSo, we can make it kind of, there we go.\n\n463\n00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:09.770\nSo now you can see that it's going\nto come in, it's gonna teeter and\n\n464\n00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.846\nthen it's gonna whoa, here we go.\n\n465\n00:24:11.846 --> 00:24:15.200\n&gt;&gt; Right over that dog\n&gt;&gt; Exactly yes, so you could go ahead and\n\n466\n00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:23.000\nedit the points on a path with the right\nclicking and editing your points.\n\n467\n00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.920\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we saw a lot of\npre-built paths that we can use and\n\n468\n00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.460\nwe can even go in and\nmodify points on that path.\n\n469\n00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.835\nBut what if I have something\nreally specific that I wanna do?\n\n470\n00:24:31.835 --> 00:24:35.670\nA certain path I need that to follow,\ncan I just start from scratch?\n\n471\n00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.650\n&gt;&gt; Kinda like you wanna draw the path?\n\n472\n00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:38.970\n&gt;&gt; That's a good idea.\n\n473\n00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:39.580\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can [LAUGH].\n\n474\n00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:45.040\nSo let's go over to the cat on this\nslide that we had removed the animation.\n\n475\n00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.250\nSo we're going to add a path,\nit's just freeform.\n\n476\n00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.340\nIt's gonna go all over the place,\nwhich, yeah,\n\n477\n00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.280\nsometimes when cats freak out,\nthey do that.\n\n478\n00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.770\nThey go crazy, [LAUGH] I know mine do.\n\n479\n00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:58.530\nSo i'm going to click on the cat and\n\n480\n00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:03.704\ni'm going to add a custom motion\npath which is right here.\n\n481\n00:25:05.225 --> 00:25:07.893\nNow once you get it,\nit's kinda like picking up your pencil.\n\n482\n00:25:07.893 --> 00:25:09.145\nIf I'm gonna draw the path,\n\n483\n00:25:09.145 --> 00:25:11.915\nnow I've got to actually apply\nwhere the path is gonna go.\n\n484\n00:25:11.915 --> 00:25:14.575\nSo since he's here,\nI'll start over the cat.\n\n485\n00:25:14.575 --> 00:25:18.525\nI could start way up here, but then it\nwould just jump all the way up and move.\n\n486\n00:25:18.525 --> 00:25:22.315\nSo I'm gonna say we're gonna go up and\ndown, and up and around, and around and\n\n487\n00:25:22.315 --> 00:25:24.035\naround, and around and\nthis way and that way.\n\n488\n00:25:24.035 --> 00:25:26.332\nAnd here let's do a little loop,\nand then go away.\n\n489\n00:25:26.332 --> 00:25:29.270\nMy biggest thing,\nwhen you're done, double-click.\n\n490\n00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:32.560\nCuz if you double-click, cuz a lot of\ntimes I'll just let go of the mouse.\n\n491\n00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:36.520\nAnd then it just, I'm like, I'm not done,\nyou have to tell it I'm done.\n\n492\n00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.770\n&gt;&gt; It still thinks you're\nstill trying to draw the path?\n\n493\n00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.618\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, and\nI always forget that.\n\n494\n00:25:40.618 --> 00:25:42.160\nI'm like op, I've gotta stop, so\n\n495\n00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.800\nnow you can see that it's just\ngonna go all the way around.\n\n496\n00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.420\nAnd okay that's starting to hurt\nmy eyes and it's hurting my head.\n\n497\n00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:51.510\nSo let's move on from that,\nat least you know that yes,\n\n498\n00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:55.400\nyou can draw a custom path, and have\nit go anywhere that you want it to go.\n\n499\n00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.330\nWhich can be a lot of fun here and there.\n\n500\n00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:01.940\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we've got a cat,\nwe can see this cat moving around.\n\n501\n00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.702\nCan we hear the cat, by chance?\n\n502\n00:26:05.702 --> 00:26:09.480\n&gt;&gt; We can, [LAUGH] another one of those\nyou wanna use a little sparingly and\n\n503\n00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.670\nknow your audience.\n\n504\n00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:15.320\nSo you can take any of your animation and\nadd a sound to it.\n\n505\n00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.393\nIt's over here on the animation pane,\n\n506\n00:26:17.393 --> 00:26:21.610\nif you drop this down,\nyou want to go into the Effect Options.\n\n507\n00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:24.110\nCuz a lot of the stuff that's in the\nEffect Options we've already went over.\n\n508\n00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:27.350\nLike we start with previous iteration,\nand the delay.\n\n509\n00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:30.180\nBut in here, you do have sound effects.\n\n510\n00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.340\nSo I could say, well what would\nI like to happen with this cat?\n\n511\n00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:38.582\nMaybe I'd like it to applause,\nand then it goes [NOISE].\n\n512\n00:26:38.582 --> 00:26:41.670\nSorry, I had my mute on,\nI'm not sure if you guys can hear that.\n\n513\n00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:45.990\nBut yes, I can say let's go ahead and\nrun this slide show.\n\n514\n00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:51.268\nAnd I'm going to start, [NOISE] [LAUGH].\n\n515\n00:26:51.268 --> 00:26:53.454\n&gt;&gt; You really need some\nsquealing tires for\n\n516\n00:26:53.454 --> 00:26:56.033\nthe way that cat was getting\nout of there [LAUGH].\n\n517\n00:26:56.033 --> 00:26:57.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly [LAUGH].\n\n518\n00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:03.320\nAnd if you did have a sound effect of\nsquealing tires, you can apply that.\n\n519\n00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.600\nBecause yes, I was using\nthe ones that are pre-built, but\n\n520\n00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.570\nyou can also go into,\nI believe, other sounds, yes.\n\n521\n00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.594\nAnd then you can add\nyour own sound to that.\n\n522\n00:27:13.594 --> 00:27:16.140\nBut, again, use sparingly,\nknow when to use it.\n\n523\n00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.950\nBut I have one last thing that\nI want to show everybody Mike,\n\n524\n00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:22.460\nand that is animated SmartArt.\n\n525\n00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.800\nSo we had gone over how to insert\nSmartArt in another episode.\n\n526\n00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.710\nBut now I want it to happen\nto where I wanna click it and\n\n527\n00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:33.242\ntype one, two, three comes in,\none, two, three.\n\n528\n00:27:33.242 --> 00:27:38.500\nBy default though, if I click on this,\nand I go ahead and add my animations.\n\n529\n00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.845\nSo let's just have it flying,\nflying's the theme of the day.\n\n530\n00:27:41.845 --> 00:27:43.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See the whole\n\n531\n00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.540\nthings comes in as one object,\nbecause it sees SmartArt as a single\n\n532\n00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:52.490\nobject as opposed to our bullet points and\nour bulleted list or our list slide.\n\n533\n00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:56.420\nSo, what you can do, though, is you need\nto just go into your Effects Options, and\n\n534\n00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:02.890\nsee it's choosing all as one object,\nokay, and all at once.\n\n535\n00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.490\nThat's not what I want, I want one by one.\n\n536\n00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:09.228\nSo that is an option within\nthe Effects Option to say now\n\n537\n00:28:09.228 --> 00:28:13.640\neach piece within that\nSmartArt is going to go.\n\n538\n00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.710\nCuz I'm around like why does\nit keep picking it all at one?\n\n539\n00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:19.140\nAnd I was like, I looked it up, and\nit was like it's just the Effects Options.\n\n540\n00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.620\nIt's been there the whole time, really.\n\n541\n00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.540\nSo, I was pretty happy\nto know how that goes.\n\n542\n00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:27.830\nSo, now I can say, this is our process,\nthis is our first step, talk, talk, talk.\n\n543\n00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:33.340\nSecond step, talk, talk, talk,\nthird step, and it can control SmartArt.\n\n544\n00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:38.160\nSmartArt, that's hard to say\nafter these long episodes.\n\n545\n00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.510\nSo I think that's where we've\nwrapped all of our animation.\n\n546\n00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:42.520\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic Yvonne,\n\n547\n00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.830\ngreat look at animation that\nwe can do within PowerPoint.\n\n548\n00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:51.131\nFrom doing fly ins to doing multiple\nanimations, now I'm getting tongue tied.\n\n549\n00:28:51.131 --> 00:28:52.632\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Tying them together,\n\n550\n00:28:52.632 --> 00:28:56.351\nchanging the timing, whether they do\nautomatically, whether you click on them.\n\n551\n00:28:56.351 --> 00:29:00.340\nWe looked at making custom paths,\nadding sounds to our animations.\n\n552\n00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:04.750\nAnd then how to even make the SmartArt\nfly in or do different effects.\n\n553\n00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:05.480\nSo, we thank you for that,\n\n554\n00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.230\nwe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n555\n00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:11.250\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n556\n00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:12.077\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n557\n00:29:12.077 --> 00:29:14.653\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n558\n00:29:14.653 --> 00:29:20.705\n[MUSIC]\n\n559\n00:29:20.705 --> 00:29:23.820\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:15.280\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.980\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we're reviewing Powerpoint 2016.\n\n7\n00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.700\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be taking a look at Slide\n\n8\n00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.940\ntransitions, and here to help us with that\nis Miss Vonne Smith, welcome back Vonne.\n\n9\n00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.005\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, I'm ready to\ntransition into slide transitions.\n\n10\n00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:31.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're so clever.\n\n11\n00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.820\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm just rolling today\naren't I [LAUGH] all right,\n\n12\n00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.950\nso what is a slide transition?\n\n13\n00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.110\nIt's exactly what it sounds like, it's how\nslides transition from one to another,\n\n14\n00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.860\nbecause by default it's just click,\nclick and it just pops right up.\n\n15\n00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.130\nBut if you wanted to like\nhave one fade into another or\n\n16\n00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.190\nyou want one to tumble out,\nthat would be a slide transition.\n\n17\n00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.337\nIt is considered animation and\nyou will get that little star on the side\n\n18\n00:00:57.337 --> 00:01:00.723\nof the slide number in your slide pane or\nyour slides tab.\n\n19\n00:01:00.723 --> 00:01:03.716\nBut it is something to just be\naware of that it could be one or\n\n20\n00:01:03.716 --> 00:01:07.458\nthe other, either look for animation,\nor look for a slide transition.\n\n21\n00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:12.244\nSo I have a file ready to go for\nus with slide transition images, so\n\n22\n00:01:12.244 --> 00:01:15.998\nI will open this up and\nit's really just pictures.\n\n23\n00:01:15.998 --> 00:01:20.814\nOkay, so I just have photographs\nthat are on a black background, and\n\n24\n00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:24.980\nwe have some scenery here,\nthis is Cartagena in Columbia.\n\n25\n00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.460\nAnd you know where this, is don't you Tim?\n\n26\n00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.325\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's DC area.\n\n27\n00:01:29.325 --> 00:01:33.196\n&gt;&gt; No, no, [LAUGH] this is Tampa.\n\n28\n00:01:33.196 --> 00:01:34.684\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's Tampa, yeah.\n\n29\n00:01:34.684 --> 00:01:36.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, that's where it's at.\n\n30\n00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.656\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n31\n00:01:37.656 --> 00:01:39.605\nthen we have some beach pictures, I think.\n\n32\n00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:42.672\nSt. Augustine and a couple other\ncoasts and then we have Chicago.\n\n33\n00:01:42.672 --> 00:01:43.267\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n34\n00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:45.596\n&gt;&gt; There we go, so\nsome different places that I have been to.\n\n35\n00:01:45.596 --> 00:01:48.184\nSo I wanted to go ahead and have my slide,\n\n36\n00:01:48.184 --> 00:01:51.640\nuse these pictures to do\nour slide transitions demo.\n\n37\n00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.840\nSo I'm going to go to slide 1, and\nhow I want the slide show to start.\n\n38\n00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.560\nNow do you want a slide\ntransition on the first slide?\n\n39\n00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.760\nThat really depends,\n\n40\n00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.390\nbecause when you apply a transition to\na slide it's how that slide comes in.\n\n41\n00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.240\nWell, that first slide is\nusually one you already have up,\n\n42\n00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.770\nlike maybe when you\nstart the presentation.\n\n43\n00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.025\n&gt;&gt; Like maybe the title\nof your presentation.\n\n44\n00:02:15.025 --> 00:02:17.290\nAlmost like a cover sheet for\nyour report or something.\n\n45\n00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.110\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, so\nthat's one where you might not always\n\n46\n00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.860\nwant to have the transition\non that first slide.\n\n47\n00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.860\nYou can do it, but I'm gonna go ahead,\n\n48\n00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.699\nI realized once I clicked on slide 1\nI was like, no, let's go to slide 2.\n\n49\n00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:30.430\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, and correctly if I'm wrong,\n\n50\n00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.486\nlet me make sure I understand.\n\n51\n00:02:31.486 --> 00:02:33.570\nSo when we talk about slide transitions,\n\n52\n00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.268\nwe're not talking about the content\non the slide, but the slide itself.\n\n53\n00:02:37.268 --> 00:02:41.803\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but the movement, yes or\nthe animation between slides.\n\n54\n00:02:41.803 --> 00:02:42.404\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n55\n00:02:42.404 --> 00:02:45.150\n&gt;&gt; So let's apply one and\nthen see how that works.\n\n56\n00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.130\nSo I'm going to go to the Transitions tab,\nhave my slide selected.\n\n57\n00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.590\nNow what type of transition\nwould I like to choose?\n\n58\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.556\nYou have some subtle ones and\nsome a little bit more robust.\n\n59\n00:02:57.556 --> 00:02:58.485\n&gt;&gt; Exciting.\n\n60\n00:02:58.485 --> 00:03:01.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's go with,\n\n61\n00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.620\nI do like the morph one cuz then it just\nkinda morphs one in on to the other.\n\n62\n00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.480\nAnd you can see you have that preview\nthere of the slide that I was on before,\n\n63\n00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.000\nslide 1.\n\n64\n00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.010\nWhen slide 2 comes in it's going to morph\ntogether, or maybe I wanted to do a wipe.\n\n65\n00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.500\nYou can see then it's going to wipe from\nthe slide before it to the next one, and\n\n66\n00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.380\nso on, and so forth.\n\n67\n00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.560\nI could do a peel off, ooh, that's fancy.\n\n68\n00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.940\n&gt;&gt; That is exciting.\n\n69\n00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.991\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] so\n\n70\n00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:34.788\nyou can apply the different ways that\nthis slide comes into the presentation.\n\n71\n00:03:34.788 --> 00:03:38.942\nAnd that's really the easiest way to do\nit, is just go ahead and go and apply it,\n\n72\n00:03:38.942 --> 00:03:41.498\nbut there of course are going\nto be a few options.\n\n73\n00:03:41.498 --> 00:03:42.985\n&gt;&gt; Can you do the airplane for us?\n\n74\n00:03:42.985 --> 00:03:44.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I wanna see it.\n\n75\n00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.280\n&gt;&gt; You wanna do the air,\nokay [LAUGH] I will do that, there you go.\n\n76\n00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.830\nAnd we fly away.\n\n77\n00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.161\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n[LAUGH]\n\n78\n00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:53.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Perfect, so right here with\n\n79\n00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.295\nthis origami slide transition you\ncan look at the different effects.\n\n80\n00:03:58.295 --> 00:04:00.240\nCuz the bird took off to the right,\n\n81\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.630\nwhat if I want it to fly out to the left,\nyou could go edit and do that.\n\n82\n00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.317\nAnd of course depending\non which transition,\n\n83\n00:04:05.317 --> 00:04:06.495\n[LAUGH] that one is really funny.\n\n84\n00:04:06.495 --> 00:04:08.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It makes me laugh every time.\n\n85\n00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.310\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n86\n00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.580\n&gt;&gt; So if I was going to do the crush then\nthat's, you can notice that right there.\n\n87\n00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.280\nWell, crush doesn't have\nany effects options because\n\n88\n00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.225\nthere really isn't much more besides\ncrushing the slide to the next one.\n\n89\n00:04:22.225 --> 00:04:26.940\n[LAUGH] So it depends on different\nanimation or transitions for\n\n90\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.320\ndifferent effects.\n\n91\n00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.830\nNow, notice when I am applying\na transition by default it's\n\n92\n00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.480\nonly going to be applied\nto that one slide.\n\n93\n00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.080\nSo if I wanted to I could\napply a different transition\n\n94\n00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.590\nto slide 3 maybe I\nwanted to do a prestige.\n\n95\n00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.910\nI'm doing pretty dramatic ones so\nyou can really see them.\n\n96\n00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.986\nSo I could have a different\nslide transition for each slide.\n\n97\n00:04:50.986 --> 00:04:56.267\nWould that get obnoxious probably pretty\nquickly, [LAUGH] so you want to one,\n\n98\n00:04:56.267 --> 00:05:01.562\nuse your slide transitions probably\nsparingly depending on your audience.\n\n99\n00:05:01.562 --> 00:05:07.358\nAnd then depend on, do you want to be\nkind of over the top like we're doing,\n\n100\n00:05:07.358 --> 00:05:13.050\nor do I want it to just maybe fade or\nlike a very simple like move up or down?\n\n101\n00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.330\nLike the old school slides, remember\nwhen you actually had to move up, yeah.\n\n102\n00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.400\n&gt;&gt; Yes, uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; So, and then so\n\n103\n00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.280\nyou could apply to each one individually.\n\n104\n00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.930\nBut what if I wanted to,\nif I have 60 slides and\n\n105\n00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.360\nI'm doing like that subtle morphing or\njust like a fade in?\n\n106\n00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.590\nI don't want to have to click it 60 times,\nI just wanna say apply to all.\n\n107\n00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.120\nWell, there's that apply to all button.\n\n108\n00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.370\nSo I could say take this,\n\n109\n00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.030\nI think we have our fracture on\nslide 2 and we can apply it to all.\n\n110\n00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.640\nAnd then you can see that it automatically\ngoes to each individual slide so\n\n111\n00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.665\nthat way when I run the show let's\njust run it for a quick second.\n\n112\n00:05:51.665 --> 00:05:55.490\nWe'll start from the beginning, you can\nsee that we're now here in Colombia and\n\n113\n00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.080\nI'm controlling the slide show just like\nI would in any other slide show, but\n\n114\n00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.990\nI have to click my mouse to go ahead and\nadvance to the next slide.\n\n115\n00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.610\nThen I have to click, and so\neach slide, each time it transitions to\n\n116\n00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.945\nthe next one is going to that fracture and\nit's gonna all fall apart and fall down.\n\n117\n00:06:12.945 --> 00:06:16.735\n&gt;&gt; Nice, all right now when we did\nour animations in an earlier episode,\n\n118\n00:06:16.735 --> 00:06:20.295\nwe were able to tie some sounds\nin with those animations.\n\n119\n00:06:20.295 --> 00:06:24.622\nAnd I'm seeing this fractured slide and\nin my head I keep hearing sounds.\n\n120\n00:06:24.622 --> 00:06:25.851\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Can we do that with the slide\n\n121\n00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:26.927\ntransitions as well?\n\n122\n00:06:26.927 --> 00:06:31.454\n&gt;&gt; You can [LAUGH] so if I go back\nto slide t2, or I can go to slide 1,\n\n123\n00:06:31.454 --> 00:06:33.957\nsince I'm applying it to all.\n\n124\n00:06:33.957 --> 00:06:38.337\nGotta go back to that right tab,\nover here you can see on the ribbon,\n\n125\n00:06:38.337 --> 00:06:41.337\nthat you can apply a sound.\n\n126\n00:06:41.337 --> 00:06:43.467\nSo we could go with,\nI mean maybe there's a bomb.\n\n127\n00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.213\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That sounds good, apply to all, so\n\n128\n00:06:47.213 --> 00:06:51.289\nlet's go ahead and\nmake sure that my speakers are not muted.\n\n129\n00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:55.667\nI'll go from the beginning, so.\n\n130\n00:06:55.667 --> 00:06:56.209\nThe bomb is a little low, but.\n\n131\n00:06:56.209 --> 00:06:56.939\n&gt;&gt; Very dramatic.\n\n132\n00:06:56.939 --> 00:07:00.463\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but it is dramatic, [LAUGH] so\n\n133\n00:07:00.463 --> 00:07:06.502\nyou could add slide sounds to your,\nwait, sounds to your slides.\n\n134\n00:07:06.502 --> 00:07:10.940\n[LAUGH] In your transitions,\nand you could apply to all.\n\n135\n00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.645\nNow the other parts that\nare on this ribbon.\n\n136\n00:07:13.645 --> 00:07:17.990\nYou have your duration and you have\nyour advance slide on mouse click, or\n\n137\n00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.565\nyou could have it advance automatically.\n\n138\n00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:25.508\nBecause this is a photo show and\nmaybe I wanted it to have this just\n\n139\n00:07:25.508 --> 00:07:31.140\ngoing in the background as I'm\ntalking about traveling the world.\n\n140\n00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.584\nI haven't really gone that many places but\n[LAUGH] so, but\n\n141\n00:07:34.584 --> 00:07:36.676\nif I had that and I just wanna talk.\n\n142\n00:07:36.676 --> 00:07:39.995\n&gt;&gt; So, scenarios where the slides maybe\naren't directly related to what you're\n\n143\n00:07:39.995 --> 00:07:42.034\nsaying so\nit doesn't matter which one it's on.\n\n144\n00:07:42.034 --> 00:07:45.248\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, and\nthere are other ways when we get into some\n\n145\n00:07:45.248 --> 00:07:48.730\nother episodes where you want\nto advance automatically.\n\n146\n00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.930\nAnd you do have a script\nthat you wanna follow.\n\n147\n00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:56.050\nSo there are many different reasons why\nyou'd want the slide show to advance\n\n148\n00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:56.600\non your own.\n\n149\n00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.440\nBut yes I like the scenario\nthat you're saying.\n\n150\n00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.490\nLet's go ahead and play it.\n\n151\n00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.020\nSo how do I do that?\n\n152\n00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:08.170\nI can come over here to slide 1, I'm gonna\ntake the sound off just so, let's do that.\n\n153\n00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:13.270\nThe duration,\nthis matters only when you have the, well,\n\n154\n00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.400\nactually, sorry, I messed up.\n\n155\n00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.810\nThe duration is the duration\nof the transition, sorry.\n\n156\n00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:22.407\nI was getting confused with the duration\nof how long the slide was up.\n\n157\n00:08:22.407 --> 00:08:25.667\nThat's actually over here, so,\nthere's two clocks over there,\n\n158\n00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:27.564\nduration of how long the effect takes.\n\n159\n00:08:27.564 --> 00:08:34.310\nAnd then how long is it going to take the\nslide to advance after so many seconds.\n\n160\n00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:36.390\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you're not gonna be there to click\nthere or you're trying to set it up so\n\n161\n00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.450\nyou don't have to click so you got to\ntell it when to move to the next one.\n\n162\n00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.180\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n163\n00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.990\nif I wanted to say like after three\nseconds I want the slide to advance.\n\n164\n00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.420\nAnd so notice I took the,\non mouse click off, and\n\n165\n00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:53.340\nthen I turned on the check box\nthat I masked with the, sorry.\n\n166\n00:08:53.340 --> 00:09:00.480\nI'm getting a little confused over here,\nthe check box is off the on mouse click.\n\n167\n00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.415\nThat's a mouthful.\n\n168\n00:09:01.415 --> 00:09:03.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's confusing, yes.\n\n169\n00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:08.380\n&gt;&gt; And I have checked on the after and\napplied a certain amount of seconds.\n\n170\n00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.970\nAnd I'm going to apply this to all,\nand so let's go ahead and\n\n171\n00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.500\nrun this slide show from the beginning.\n\n172\n00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.610\nSo you could see it's going to do this.\n\n173\n00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.640\nAnd if we were counting after\nthree seconds you could see\n\n174\n00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.400\nthat the slide is going to advance\nto the next slide for three seconds.\n\n175\n00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.190\nAnd so then I can talk about all\nthe different places, and the beach,\n\n176\n00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:31.320\nand how I'd really like to go there very\nsoon because it's really nice weather\n\n177\n00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.730\nright now, and the sun set is so pretty.\n\n178\n00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:38.190\nSo you can see that the slide is gonna\ncontinue to go until the very end.\n\n179\n00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.960\nAnd so I don't have to think\nabout clicking my mouse and\n\n180\n00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.030\ncontrolling when the slide is\ngoing to move to the next one.\n\n181\n00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:48.210\nNow you can see that right now the show\nhas ended because that was my last slide.\n\n182\n00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:52.240\nAnd I was hoping to talk enough\nto have it get to the end.\n\n183\n00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.840\nBecause that's how I\nsetup the show to run.\n\n184\n00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.160\nNow I feel like it's only\nnatural that if you're going to\n\n185\n00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.610\nbe doing these types of presentations,\nmaybe you want it to just loop back,\n\n186\n00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.990\nwant to continue because maybe you're\nat a kiosk, or you're at a trade show.\n\n187\n00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.010\nAnd you want that to just keep on moving,\nand\n\n188\n00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.980\na lot of times that's what you would\ndo is have it transition automatically.\n\n189\n00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.910\nSo I wanted to just show you here on\nthis slide show tab that the setup,\n\n190\n00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.440\nright there, Set Up slide show,\nright now it's just set\n\n191\n00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.790\nas your normal just presented by\nthe speaker and the speaker controls it.\n\n192\n00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:30.240\nBut if you choose the browse at kiosk\nwhat that means is that it's going to\n\n193\n00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:35.240\nautomatically loop the slide\nshow until you tell it to stop.\n\n194\n00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.080\nSo it's just the easiest way, now you\ncould go ahead and choose this option and\n\n195\n00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.420\nsay loop until continuously until escape.\n\n196\n00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.910\nBut you could also go in and click on\nit and you can override the settings.\n\n197\n00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:51.200\nSo doing the browsed at a kiosk is just\n\n198\n00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.060\nthe easiest way to say don't\nhave anything else control it.\n\n199\n00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.980\nJust go, run,\nloop until infinity until I come in and\n\n200\n00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.500\nsay escape on the keyboard and\nactually stop the show.\n\n201\n00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.855\nAnd then it will go ahead and\n\n202\n00:11:03.855 --> 00:11:07.130\nloop, we won't test this out\ncuz I know it will work, and\n\n203\n00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.570\nthen we'll just have to sit here and talk\nabout different places where we've been.\n\n204\n00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:11.858\nAnd then talk about the beach some more.\n\n205\n00:11:11.858 --> 00:11:12.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So [LAUGH], but\n\n206\n00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:13.990\nI did want to point that out.\n\n207\n00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.430\nAnd we will be going over some other\n\n208\n00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.360\noptions of setting up slide\nshows on future episodes, but\n\n209\n00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.980\nI just feel like I had to say that\nwhen we did the advanced slide.\n\n210\n00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.146\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you did,\ncuz it was gonna be my next question.\n\n211\n00:11:26.146 --> 00:11:28.050\n&gt;&gt; Well perfect, [LAUGH] see,\nI was reading your mind.\n\n212\n00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:28.670\n&gt;&gt; I like it, I like it.\n&gt;&gt; See,\n\n213\n00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.100\nwe did a nice transition\nthere of knowledge [LAUGH].\n\n214\n00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.350\n&gt;&gt; Gotta slip that one in.\n\n215\n00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.820\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes, so\n\n216\n00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:39.630\nthere's one more type of slide\ntransition that I just find really cool.\n\n217\n00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:44.370\nSo I wanted to show you guys this,\nso I'm just gonna minimize this so\n\n218\n00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:49.700\nI can get back, it's just an easier\nway for me to open up another version.\n\n219\n00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.890\nSo I have the ones with images and then\nthis is like maybe more of traditional,\n\n220\n00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:58.890\nif you wanna say,\nPowerPoint presentation with words.\n\n221\n00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:03.879\nThe morph transition, let's go over here\nto transitions and go to Morph and for\n\n222\n00:12:03.879 --> 00:12:08.644\nthat one it just looks like its kinda of\nmorphing or fading into each other and\n\n223\n00:12:08.644 --> 00:12:12.260\nit doesn't seem like\nthere's anything special.\n\n224\n00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.650\nBut it's in the effect options of\nthis particular slide transition,\n\n225\n00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.140\nthat I think is kinda neat.\n\n226\n00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.580\nIf you go with words, you could see that,\nthat one didn't work very well.\n\n227\n00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.621\nWrong slide to do the words one,\n[LAUGH] but they do have the characters.\n\n228\n00:12:25.621 --> 00:12:29.175\nSo let me go with characters, so\nyou see it's gonna take the different\n\n229\n00:12:29.175 --> 00:12:30.403\ncharacters-\n&gt;&gt; Get out.\n\n230\n00:12:30.403 --> 00:12:32.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, isn't that neat?\n\n231\n00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:32.915\n&gt;&gt; That was cool.\n\n232\n00:12:32.915 --> 00:12:36.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And position itself\non the slides for the next one.\n\n233\n00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.263\nSo if I took this one, and\ndid the morph, all right,\n\n234\n00:12:40.263 --> 00:12:45.590\nnow if I did the words I think there's\nenough words on here there's a couple.\n\n235\n00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:51.105\nSo you could see that it's\nmatching words or characters,\n\n236\n00:12:51.105 --> 00:12:56.628\nI believe it's this one that\nthe morph by words is the yes.\n\n237\n00:12:56.628 --> 00:13:00.408\nSo you could see that it took quite a few\nwords that were on slide 3 cuz remember\n\n238\n00:13:00.408 --> 00:13:04.178\nwhen I apply the transitions about\nhow it goes from the one before it.\n\n239\n00:13:04.178 --> 00:13:09.100\nSo slide 3 had quite a few words,\nthat were present on slide 4,\n\n240\n00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.460\nand so it just kinda moved it around and\nI just, I just think that's so cool.\n\n241\n00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is pretty neat, I have to say.\n\n242\n00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:19.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I really wanted to include\nthat as part of our slide transitions.\n\n243\n00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.465\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne,\nwell great look there at,\n\n244\n00:13:21.465 --> 00:13:24.270\nkinda continuing the thought\nprocess of animations.\n\n245\n00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.110\nThis episode we were really\nfocused on slide transitions,\n\n246\n00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:31.370\nwhat's happening between your slides\nas you're giving that presentation.\n\n247\n00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:32.940\nSo we thank you for that Vonne.\n\n248\n00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.830\nWe hope everybody out there enjoyed\nwatching this one, signing off for\n\n249\n00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.060\nITProTV I've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n250\n00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:38.659\n&gt;&gt;

ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.532\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing PowerPoint 2016.\n\n7\n00:00:19.532 --> 00:00:21.184\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n8\n00:00:21.184 --> 00:00:24.760\nwe're gonna be taking a look at some of\nthe things we need to be familiar with or\n\n9\n00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.922\nare able to do,\nto prepare our presentation.\n\n10\n00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:28.990\nAnd here to help us with that is Ms.\nVonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.762\nWelcome back Vonne.\n\n12\n00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:33.893\n&gt;&gt; Hello, so yes, we're going\nto start getting our PowerPoint\n\n13\n00:00:33.893 --> 00:00:37.796\npresentation ready to actually\npresent to our audience.\n\n14\n00:00:37.796 --> 00:00:41.741\nBecause you've gone through and you've\nadded all of your test to see that all\n\n15\n00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:45.988\nyour images, maybe put in a few animations\nand some slight changes everything that\n\n16\n00:00:45.988 --> 00:00:49.203\nwe've covered and all of our other\nepisodes up to this point and\n\n17\n00:00:49.203 --> 00:00:52.385\nnow you're ready to take the show\non the road and get on going.\n\n18\n00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:56.765\nSo we're going to go over different\nthings that you need to do before\n\n19\n00:00:56.765 --> 00:01:00.730\nyou get in front of your audience and\nput the presentation on the screen.\n\n20\n00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.230\nSo let's jump in and\n\n21\n00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.160\nget to a presentation that I've\nstrategically called prepare presentation.\n\n22\n00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.750\nThis is actually the same slide show\nthat I used in the very beginning when\n\n23\n00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.440\nwe introduced our cats and\nlet's learn all about PowerPoint.\n\n24\n00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.881\nI did make a few adjustments on this,\nspecifically for this particular topic.\n\n25\n00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:26.352\nSo first thing you should always\ndo before you're ready to present,\n\n26\n00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:30.978\nyou should always run a spellcheck\nbecause, [LAUGH] I know that PowerPoint\n\n27\n00:01:30.978 --> 00:01:34.939\nhas those red squigglies that\nalert you of the different things.\n\n28\n00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.748\nThat you have misspelled the word and\nsome of them might be on purpose in\n\n29\n00:01:39.748 --> 00:01:44.899\na sense that you have your company\ninitials, or something to that effect.\n\n30\n00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.363\nWe talked about adding the dictionary\nin other episodes, but\n\n31\n00:01:48.363 --> 00:01:49.628\nI wanted to go ahead and\n\n32\n00:01:49.628 --> 00:01:54.940\nalso include spell check in this episode,\nbecause it is very, very important.\n\n33\n00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.798\nSo where do we go to run a spell check?\n\n34\n00:01:56.798 --> 00:02:00.955\nAnd I'm gonna start from Slide 1 because\nI wanna start from the very beginning and\n\n35\n00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:03.789\nhave PowerPoint go through\nthe entire presentation and\n\n36\n00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.974\ntell me where it sees different mistakes.\n\n37\n00:02:05.974 --> 00:02:11.800\nSo it is in the Review tab and\nit's over here on the left for Spelling.\n\n38\n00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.650\nAnd you can see that\nkeyboard strokecutt of F7.\n\n39\n00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.870\nBut Keyboard shortcuts are great and\nI use them all the time, but\n\n40\n00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.720\nremember you don't always have to.\n\n41\n00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.068\nI'm gonna go with our spelling and\nit goes through and says that it found\n\n42\n00:02:23.068 --> 00:02:27.562\nthat design is spelled wrong, and\nit gives me their suggestions of what it\n\n43\n00:02:27.562 --> 00:02:32.219\nthinks it It needs to correct it and\nsometimes I spell words so incorrectly.\n\n44\n00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.729\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't have any suggestions like okay\n\n45\n00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:37.740\nthis isn't helping cuz I\nreally can't spell this word.\n\n46\n00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.890\n&gt;&gt; It's necessary.\n\n47\n00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.310\n&gt;&gt; Right yes, necessary.\n\n48\n00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.900\nSo, we go to, yes I'd like to go with\ndesign and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n49\n00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.833\ntell it to change.\n\n50\n00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:52.000\nNow if I had misspelled design this way\nin multiple places I could go ahead and\n\n51\n00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.350\ndo a change or\nI'm just gonna go ahead and do a change.\n\n52\n00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.366\nAnd then it goes to the next one which\nis going to be Is I forgot my y, so\n\n53\n00:03:00.366 --> 00:03:05.927\nI'll go ahead and change that and\nit says it is all done don't rely on that.\n\n54\n00:03:05.927 --> 00:03:10.880\n[LAUGH] Because,\nit's funny words that are spelt wrong but\n\n55\n00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.159\nit is not going to prove your slides for\ngrammatical mistakes or\n\n56\n00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.358\nany type of things like on slide two,\ncats is fun.\n\n57\n00:03:20.358 --> 00:03:21.016\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not right.\n\n58\n00:03:21.016 --> 00:03:24.530\n[LAUGH] But you see it's not\ngiving you any warning on that.\n\n59\n00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.060\nIt is not good with grammar,\n\n60\n00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.710\nit does not do that automatically\nchecking grammar like Word does.\n\n61\n00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.240\nWord's really good at that,\nbit does not do that in PowerPoint.\n\n62\n00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.690\nEven with your spell check,\nyou can go into your options,\n\n63\n00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.510\nI just wanna show you the back end,\nthe back stage view, and\n\n64\n00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.260\nyou can go into your options,\nand you go into your proofing.\n\n65\n00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.018\nYou can see it,\nI have Check grammar with spelling.\n\n66\n00:03:50.018 --> 00:03:54.260\nI have that as an option on\nin my PowerPoint options and\n\n67\n00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.157\nit didn't catch that.\n\n68\n00:03:56.157 --> 00:04:00.400\nSo make sure, proof,\nproof, and proof again.\n\n69\n00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.348\nI always found that a little technique\nof proofing things read backwards\n\n70\n00:04:05.348 --> 00:04:07.120\nof upside down.\n\n71\n00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.750\nYou turn the paper upside down and\nyou go that way.\n\n72\n00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.620\nSo you're not actually\nreading it cuz your brain,\n\n73\n00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.370\nyour eyes kind of see it, it sees it\nwrong, and you can still see it wrong.\n\n74\n00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think if you're\ntrying to proof of spelling,\n\n75\n00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.470\nit's much better to actually go backwards\ncuz your brain can't fix it for you.\n\n76\n00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.788\nBut if you're doing grammar, you've gotta\ngo forwards because reading it backwards\n\n77\n00:04:26.788 --> 00:04:28.755\neverything is gonna be\ngrammatically incorrect.\n\n78\n00:04:28.755 --> 00:04:29.284\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n79\n00:04:29.284 --> 00:04:31.151\n[LAUGH] Yeah so, definitely.\n\n80\n00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:32.005\n&gt;&gt; That's a great, yeah.\n\n81\n00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:32.870\n&gt;&gt; Or have somebody else prove it?\n\n82\n00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.230\n&gt;&gt; Yes, for sure.\n\n83\n00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.602\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I have found that getting another set\n\n84\n00:04:36.602 --> 00:04:41.169\nof eyes on there, is a big, big help and\nthere's nothing more embarrassing than\n\n85\n00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.736\ngetting up to give a presentation, whether\nit's in front of your co-workers or\n\n86\n00:04:45.736 --> 00:04:50.034\nyour bosses or whomever and have a big\nglaring spelling error in the middle of\n\n87\n00:04:50.034 --> 00:04:53.018\nyour presentation or\ngrammatical error like that.\n\n88\n00:04:53.018 --> 00:04:56.884\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, I know when I\ndo freelance design for booklets,\n\n89\n00:04:56.884 --> 00:05:00.980\nwe would actually hire two different\nproofreaders to read the book.\n\n90\n00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.010\nAnd because me as the designer,\n\n91\n00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.160\nI've been looking at this stuff for months\nsometimes, and it looks right to me.\n\n92\n00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.103\nAnd I have missed that over and over and\nover and I've just never caught it, so\n\n93\n00:05:11.103 --> 00:05:12.630\nit's always good to do that.\n\n94\n00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:19.040\nSo for example here on this slide two,\nyou can see I have tales and charts.\n\n95\n00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.480\nIt's spelled, right?\n\n96\n00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.550\nWe could tell a tall tale\nabout some charts, but\n\n97\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.930\nwe really wanna be talking about tables.\n\n98\n00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.070\nOkay so, let's spell that right,\n[LAUGH] Tables, there's we go.\n\n99\n00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.450\nAnd cats are very fun, they are nice.\n\n100\n00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.680\nOr a cat is fun, but\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n101\n00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.780\ndo that subject-verb\nagreement right there.\n\n102\n00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.450\nAnd so just emphasize in that point\nof always looking at your slides and\n\n103\n00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.580\nproof of them.\n\n104\n00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.660\nBut another thing that we could do here,\nis like cats are fun,\n\n105\n00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.617\nfun but there could be a better word for\nfun and that's one of my favorites.\n\n106\n00:05:54.617 --> 00:05:55.184\nWow, see.\n\n107\n00:05:55.184 --> 00:05:58.754\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna trip over it cuz every time I\n\n108\n00:05:58.754 --> 00:06:00.376\ntry it, thesaurus.\n\n109\n00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:01.351\nHow about you-\n&gt;&gt; Thesaurus.\n\n110\n00:06:01.351 --> 00:06:02.406\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; The thesaurus.\n\n111\n00:06:02.406 --> 00:06:03.055\n&gt;&gt; Thesaurus.\n\n112\n00:06:03.055 --> 00:06:06.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The book that gives you words of other\n\n113\n00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.551\nwords cuz [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Words that have similar or\n\n114\n00:06:09.551 --> 00:06:10.830\nthe same meaning.\n\n115\n00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.330\nThat's a great point though because it's\nreally easy to use the same word over and\n\n116\n00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.280\nover and over.\n\n117\n00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.491\nAnd add a little bit of variety\nit just kinda spices things up.\n\n118\n00:06:20.491 --> 00:06:24.670\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and so I'm gonna show you what\nI think is the easiest way to use this.\n\n119\n00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.107\nBecause you can see right next to\nspelling you have that word right there,\n\n120\n00:06:28.107 --> 00:06:31.555\n[LAUGH] That I'm gonna mispronounce for\nthe rest of the episode, so\n\n121\n00:06:31.555 --> 00:06:34.469\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nsay that button right there.\n\n122\n00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:38.903\nThe only thing about using this option is\nthat when it puts the thesaurus on that\n\n123\n00:06:38.903 --> 00:06:43.757\nright-hand side, I'm like, well,\nentertaining, I think that's a good one.\n\n124\n00:06:43.757 --> 00:06:47.588\nSo you click on entertaining, but then\nwhat it does is it what puts entertaining\n\n125\n00:06:47.588 --> 00:06:51.160\nand gives you other words for\nentertaining and then hilarious.\n\n126\n00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.250\nAnd then it keeps jumping to me,\nI don't know, maybe it's just my\n\n127\n00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.070\nintuitions like I would think that if\nI clicked it it would change the word.\n\n128\n00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.081\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwhy do I wanna look up sometimes for\n\n129\n00:07:01.081 --> 00:07:03.389\nthe synonym of the word\nI'm trying to replace.\n\n130\n00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:06.528\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it seems very cyclical\nright there and this is not giving me.\n\n131\n00:07:06.528 --> 00:07:10.428\nIf you wanted to put in entertaining you\nhave to go to that drop down and you have\n\n132\n00:07:10.428 --> 00:07:14.630\nto say insert, and I don't, it's just\na few extra steps that I don't wanna take.\n\n133\n00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.850\nI'm gonna undo that to show you\nthe way that I'd like to do it,\n\n134\n00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.050\nis if you right click.\n\n135\n00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.260\nIf you right click on any of your word\nyou will always get that option for\n\n136\n00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.990\nsynonyms and then you can see right\nthere I'm using entertaining, enjoyable.\n\n137\n00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.750\nSo I'm gonna say, entertaining,\nI click it and it changes it.\n\n138\n00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.530\nSo I think that's a little easier\nthan going through the panel.\n\n139\n00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.050\nBut I did wanna show you each option\nif you are interested in that.\n\n140\n00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:43.329\nSo you could go to your presentation and\nright-click on your words and\n\n141\n00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:44.862\nfind synonyms for them.\n\n142\n00:07:44.862 --> 00:07:48.822\n&gt;&gt; I could see maybe a situation where\nyou're looking at that panel on the right,\n\n143\n00:07:48.822 --> 00:07:50.262\nand you see entertaining and\n\n144\n00:07:50.262 --> 00:07:54.050\nyou're like that's almost what I wanna\nreplace fun with, but not quite.\n\n145\n00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.276\nSo I click on it and it gives me other\nwords that are similar to entertaining and\n\n146\n00:07:57.276 --> 00:07:59.129\nthere I find one that's more appropriate.\n\n147\n00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:02.705\nSo maybe sometimes just depending on\nyour workflow and how your brain works.\n\n148\n00:08:02.705 --> 00:08:04.350\nYeah, maybe that panel works better for\nyou.\n\n149\n00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.167\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes just more and\nmore options.\n\n150\n00:08:06.167 --> 00:08:07.690\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n&gt;&gt; So that's great.\n\n151\n00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:13.148\nSpeaking of options, so I've gone through\nand I've proofed it I've spell checked.\n\n152\n00:08:13.148 --> 00:08:16.640\nI've gone through my synonyms and\nI'm ready to go.\n\n153\n00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.474\nAnd I'm go to I'm gonna save my changes.\n\n154\n00:08:19.474 --> 00:08:22.693\nActually I'm not gonna save my changes\nbecause I wanna make sure you guys can\n\n155\n00:08:22.693 --> 00:08:24.716\nhave this file at the end\nof this presentation.\n\n156\n00:08:24.716 --> 00:08:26.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm not gonna save it.\n\n157\n00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:31.100\nNormally what I would do is save all my\nchanges and say, yes, I'm ready to go.\n\n158\n00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.200\nAnd then I maybe take my laptop, and\nI go to Chicago, and I'm ready for\n\n159\n00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.340\nmy presentation.\n\n160\n00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:40.450\nAnd I have all my files with me so\nI'm fine.\n\n161\n00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.044\nAnd I know that my computer is going to\nrun the presentation, so I don't think\n\n162\n00:08:44.044 --> 00:08:47.767\nthere's any problem, but you get there and\nthen they don't have a projector.\n\n163\n00:08:47.767 --> 00:08:52.188\nOr there's some type of technical\nglitch that you're not able to-\n\n164\n00:08:52.188 --> 00:08:53.412\n&gt;&gt; Get a VGA cable and\n\n165\n00:08:53.412 --> 00:08:55.619\nI'm only got HDMI on my laptop.\n\n166\n00:08:55.619 --> 00:09:00.452\n&gt;&gt; Yes the USB 3 Cs and all that fun\nstuff, and that could be a mess.\n\n167\n00:09:00.452 --> 00:09:02.880\nSo you can print your presentation.\n\n168\n00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:08.940\nYou could still present your slides,\nbut it could be on a piece of paper.\n\n169\n00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.230\nSo you always wanna have a backup.\n\n170\n00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.920\nYou never know what's gonna go on, so\n\n171\n00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.400\nI wanted to go over some\nprinting options with you.\n\n172\n00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.170\nSo I'm going over to the File tab and\nI'm gonna go over to Print.\n\n173\n00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:23.620\nAnd you can see that I can go ahead and\nprint out one slide per paper and\n\n174\n00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.350\nthat would be great and\nI could have that as a back up.\n\n175\n00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:30.185\nOr you have of course different options,\nso you can see in the settings\n\n176\n00:09:30.185 --> 00:09:34.540\nit's showing print all slides, yes maybe\nI would like to go ahead and do that but\n\n177\n00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.413\nyou could pick a specific slide or\na specific range.\n\n178\n00:09:37.413 --> 00:09:42.207\nAnd because this slide show has sections\ndesignated you could print individual\n\n179\n00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:45.712\nsections, that'd be really handy and\nanother reason why\n\n180\n00:09:45.712 --> 00:09:50.910\nyou wanna use sections for organizing\nyour slides for this printing purpose.\n\n181\n00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.150\nSo I'm gonna keep it on all slides for\nnow.\n\n182\n00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:57.271\nThe other thing that I want to show you is\nunder the slides, well this would be where\n\n183\n00:09:57.271 --> 00:10:00.409\nI would actually designate\nthe range of the number of slides.\n\n184\n00:10:00.409 --> 00:10:05.996\nYou have like what are you printing,\nand you can see full page slides,\n\n185\n00:10:05.996 --> 00:10:09.698\none per page, or\nI can put two slides on a page.\n\n186\n00:10:09.698 --> 00:10:11.520\nI think you get the idea.\n\n187\n00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.277\nThree, six, nine, however you\nwant to tile your slide handouts.\n\n188\n00:10:16.277 --> 00:10:21.152\nThe one of the three slides I find kind of\nnice cuz what if you wanted them to take\n\n189\n00:10:21.152 --> 00:10:22.510\nnotes along the way.\n\n190\n00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:26.310\nI always thought that was really handy\nthat they put the lines to the right\n\n191\n00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.540\nof the side in the three slide layout.\n\n192\n00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.490\nThe other things you can print,\nyour notes page.\n\n193\n00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:32.600\nRemember your speaker notes?\n\n194\n00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.170\nThat would be for you, and I've done\nit many times where I've printed out my\n\n195\n00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:40.850\npresentation in this particular notes\npage, so while I'm doing my presentation\n\n196\n00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:45.210\nI can have that over here and like look\nand make sure yep, I remember to say that.\n\n197\n00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:49.508\nSo using your notes in the printing\nis very handy as well.\n\n198\n00:10:49.508 --> 00:10:52.456\nAnd if you have your outline,\nthe outline view is just,\n\n199\n00:10:52.456 --> 00:10:54.610\nyou don't have the slides visually.\n\n200\n00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.450\nYou just have the text\nthat's on the slides.\n\n201\n00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:00.330\nSo if you have very text-intensive slides,\nthis could be a good option for\n\n202\n00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.840\nthe different ways of printing, and then\nyou just go ahead and click the Print.\n\n203\n00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.184\nAnd if I click Print right now,\n\n204\n00:11:05.184 --> 00:11:08.301\nit's not gonna go anywhere because\nI don't have a printer connected.\n\n205\n00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:08.801\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n206\n00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:10.805\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, I think you get the idea.\n\n207\n00:11:10.805 --> 00:11:12.774\nAnd you can go ahead and\n\n208\n00:11:12.774 --> 00:11:16.556\nchange the copies from there.\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n209\n00:11:16.556 --> 00:11:17.960\nexit out of the print.\n\n210\n00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.450\nOne of the thing that I wanted to show you\nwas hiding slides and I know you've this\n\n211\n00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:26.840\nin another episode but since we're talking\nabout preparing the show, maybe I'm going\n\n212\n00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:32.160\nsomewhere where I really don't want slide\nthree to show up in the presentation.\n\n213\n00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.180\nSo you could always go ahead and hide that\nslide and post that line throw it and\n\n214\n00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:41.970\nthat way that slide will\nnot run in the show and\n\n215\n00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.820\njust wanted to cover that really quick.\n\n216\n00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.445\nAnother thing that I probably should\nhave covered before we went into\n\n217\n00:11:46.445 --> 00:11:47.356\nthe printing options.\n\n218\n00:11:47.356 --> 00:11:51.240\n[LAUGH] So a little out of order,\nwould be headers and footers.\n\n219\n00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.770\nBecause you could display headers and\n\n220\n00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:58.790\nfooters in either the presentation or\non just the notes.\n\n221\n00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.540\nIt just depends on which one you wanna\ndo and I want to show you those options.\n\n222\n00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.490\nNow why would you want to put headers and\nfooters?\n\n223\n00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:08.810\nCuz maybe I want to put my company's name\nat the bottom of each of these slides.\n\n224\n00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.719\nSlide numbers, I want to go ahead and\n\n225\n00:12:10.719 --> 00:12:14.305\nput that slide number on the bottom\nright hand corner so people know.\n\n226\n00:12:14.305 --> 00:12:18.400\nOne thing I would say about putting slide\nnumbers is if you have a lot of slides,\n\n227\n00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.704\nyou have a long presentation,\nI was like we're on slide 55?\n\n228\n00:12:21.704 --> 00:12:23.567\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How many more do we have?\n\n229\n00:12:23.567 --> 00:12:26.280\n[LAUGH] That might be like all right,\n\n230\n00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.152\npeople might be watching that and\nstart to get a little lamsy.\n\n231\n00:12:30.152 --> 00:12:32.167\n&gt;&gt; We'll slip out the back\nbefore we finishes.\n\n232\n00:12:32.167 --> 00:12:37.597\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, [LAUGH] So you might reasons\nwhy and why not to have slide numbers,\n\n233\n00:12:37.597 --> 00:12:40.873\nheads and footers, so\nwhy don't I go ahead and\n\n234\n00:12:40.873 --> 00:12:45.997\nshow you where they're at,\nthey're in the Insert tab, and over here,\n\n235\n00:12:45.997 --> 00:12:51.121\nI have headers and footers, you do\nhave over here insert slide number and\n\n236\n00:12:51.121 --> 00:12:54.910\nthen also insert date and\ntime What was that, sorry.\n\n237\n00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:55.889\nIt says I don't have my resolution,\n\n238\n00:12:55.889 --> 00:12:57.542\nI'm like I can't even remember\nwhat that button was, okay.\n\n239\n00:12:57.542 --> 00:12:59.702\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we've already inserted object so\n\n240\n00:12:59.702 --> 00:13:00.355\nwe're fine.\n\n241\n00:13:00.355 --> 00:13:04.271\nI'm gonna go straight to header and footer\nbecause all of those things, the date and\n\n242\n00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:06.493\ntime and\nslide numbers are all within here too.\n\n243\n00:13:06.493 --> 00:13:12.690\nSo you could see that, do I want to\ndisplay on the slides the date and time?\n\n244\n00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:13.430\nYes or no?\n\n245\n00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.280\nAnd then do you want that\nto update automatically.\n\n246\n00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.711\nSo if it's tomorrow,\nit would show the next day.\n\n247\n00:13:17.711 --> 00:13:22.150\nOr I want it fixed so I could have when\nI created the slide show presentation.\n\n248\n00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:26.031\nAnd you can see the check boxes for\ninclude the slide number,\n\n249\n00:13:26.031 --> 00:13:27.409\ninclude the footer.\n\n250\n00:13:27.409 --> 00:13:32.212\nAnd I can just go ahead and\ntype in ITProTV, if I wanted to do that.\n\n251\n00:13:32.212 --> 00:13:33.390\nDon't show on title side.\n\n252\n00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.110\nThat would be a good option to,\ncuz your title side's usually up and\n\n253\n00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.690\nrunning when people are coming into the,\nthe presentation hall,\n\n254\n00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.920\nso you might not want to show that there,\nso that option is there as well.\n\n255\n00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.420\nBut notice that this is for the slides,\nnot the notes and handouts.\n\n256\n00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:53.250\nSo maybe you wanna put headers, footers,\ndates, times and some page numbers.\n\n257\n00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.320\nI was gonna say slide but\nI realized it doesn't say slide.\n\n258\n00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.840\nYou could put on just the note and\nnot the slides, so\n\n259\n00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.450\nyou have that control on\nwhich ones you want to do.\n\n260\n00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:06.060\nI'm just gonna check them all just\nbecause, and this is a header and\n\n261\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:06.780\nthis is a footer.\n\n262\n00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.218\nThat doesn't come automatically.\n\n263\n00:14:08.218 --> 00:14:12.671\nI was testing this out with\nthe file to begin with so\n\n264\n00:14:12.671 --> 00:14:15.861\nthat's why it's there I did that.\n\n265\n00:14:15.861 --> 00:14:16.373\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n266\n00:14:16.373 --> 00:14:17.833\n&gt;&gt; So now I just go ahead and\n\n267\n00:14:17.833 --> 00:14:22.100\nclick Apply to All.\nAnd you can see that it shows the headers\n\n268\n00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:26.110\nand footers on the slides,\nas well as if I go over to File and\n\n269\n00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:31.120\ngo to Print and say print out what and I'm\ngoing to say print out the notes you can\n\n270\n00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.410\nsee that the headers and footers,\nare all on the notes and the slides.\n\n271\n00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:36.949\nSo that is an option.\n\n272\n00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:40.579\nI have had people come in say I've\ngot a presentations limit and\n\n273\n00:14:40.579 --> 00:14:41.960\nI can not take them off.\n\n274\n00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.010\nCuz it's just like Insert Header and\nFooter,\n\n275\n00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.470\nthere's no remove header and footer.\n\n276\n00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.500\nRight, so if you check it on,\nyou check it off.\n\n277\n00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.710\nSo you go to the same place and\n\n278\n00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:58.350\nyou turn off all of those headers and\nfooters that you do not want to have.\n\n279\n00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:02.788\nAnd the location, one more point,\nthe location of where the headers and\n\n280\n00:15:02.788 --> 00:15:04.825\nfooters are, how they display,\n\n281\n00:15:04.825 --> 00:15:08.858\nthat's all part of the design theme\nthat you apply to the slides.\n\n282\n00:15:08.858 --> 00:15:11.794\nSo, if you change design themes,\nthey'll be in different places, and\n\n283\n00:15:11.794 --> 00:15:12.980\nlook different.\n\n284\n00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.939\nIf you're applying them to your slides.\n\n285\n00:15:15.939 --> 00:15:18.458\n&gt;&gt; Very good,\nvery good yeah I find that useful.\n\n286\n00:15:18.458 --> 00:15:19.530\nLike maybe on my slides,\n\n287\n00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:22.809\nI don't put my company name cuz I'm up\nthere giving them the presentation.\n\n288\n00:15:22.809 --> 00:15:25.559\nI've got my logoed shirt on or\nwhat have you.\n\n289\n00:15:25.559 --> 00:15:28.519\nBut if I've got copies of the slide,\nyou know, handouts.\n\n290\n00:15:28.519 --> 00:15:30.100\nPeople come in later, pick them up.\n\n291\n00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.110\nThis is great information.\n\n292\n00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:32.539\nI wonder who did this?\n\n293\n00:15:32.539 --> 00:15:34.290\nHaving that on there\ncan be really helpful.\n\n294\n00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:35.450\n&gt;&gt; Exactly definitely.\n\n295\n00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.262\nSo, let's say you're\nready to run the show.\n\n296\n00:15:39.262 --> 00:15:43.287\nI wanna give you a couple little\ntidbits on actually presenting it in\n\n297\n00:15:43.287 --> 00:15:44.566\nthe slideshow view.\n\n298\n00:15:44.566 --> 00:15:47.427\nSo let's go over to Slideshow,\nand we are going to go ahead and\n\n299\n00:15:47.427 --> 00:15:48.920\nstart this from the beginning.\n\n300\n00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:55.006\nAnd it starts, and this is where our title\nslide is and we have everybody coming in.\n\n301\n00:15:55.006 --> 00:15:59.701\nAnd we've seen in other episodes that if\nI wanted to advance the slide you click.\n\n302\n00:15:59.701 --> 00:16:02.974\nThere are a bunch of other ways, and\nfor some reason on mine there is,\n\n303\n00:16:02.974 --> 00:16:05.474\nI have to move my mouse around and\nit kinda gets lost.\n\n304\n00:16:05.474 --> 00:16:07.463\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See, it went away again.\n\n305\n00:16:07.463 --> 00:16:11.920\nBut that's just me and that's actually\nprobably a good thing cuz you would want\n\n306\n00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.860\nit to go away but I keep losing it and\nit takes a while for it to come back.\n\n307\n00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.450\nSo I had to keep waking it up.\n\n308\n00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:22.110\nAll right, so mouse, but\nyour keyboard there are so\n\n309\n00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.750\nmany buttons that you would never\nthink that would actually do it.\n\n310\n00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:28.250\nYour arrow keys are one of them,\nI'm sorry I went through too fast.\n\n311\n00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.010\nRight arrow, advance.\n\n312\n00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.230\nRight arrow, advance.\n\n313\n00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.220\nLeft arrow, advance.\n\n314\n00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.601\nNo, the other advance.\n\n315\n00:16:34.601 --> 00:16:36.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Backwards.\n\n316\n00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.515\nYou also have your up and down arrows.\n\n317\n00:16:38.515 --> 00:16:41.459\nWe'll go ahead and\ncycle through your slides, as well.\n\n318\n00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:46.055\nBut you also have the N key,\nthe N is for next.\n\n319\n00:16:46.055 --> 00:16:48.598\nYou also have P, for previous.\n\n320\n00:16:48.598 --> 00:16:51.432\nSo those will advance the slides as well.\n\n321\n00:16:51.432 --> 00:16:54.990\nYou also have the spacebar,\nthe spacebar will take you forward.\n\n322\n00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:59.180\nAnd the delete, or\nbackspace key will take you back.\n\n323\n00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.910\nSo, lots of different\nthings that you can find,\n\n324\n00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.062\nI actually went through and\nclicked every single letter one time.\n\n325\n00:17:03.062 --> 00:17:04.094\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What does it do?\n\n326\n00:17:04.094 --> 00:17:05.643\nAnd found a couple other ones.\n\n327\n00:17:05.643 --> 00:17:10.153\nSo say I'm presenting and\nwe get into a really good discussion.\n\n328\n00:17:10.153 --> 00:17:13.198\nAnd I really want to focus\non the audience, and\n\n329\n00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:15.471\nI don't want them to look up here.\n\n330\n00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:18.802\nYou can hit the W and\nyou can go to a white screen.\n\n331\n00:17:18.802 --> 00:17:23.158\nSo then it takes it off the text and\nthen you can focus on that and say,\n\n332\n00:17:23.158 --> 00:17:25.230\nokay we're doing really good.\n\n333\n00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:28.991\nYou hit the W again, and\nthen it goes ahead and brings it back.\n\n334\n00:17:28.991 --> 00:17:32.762\nThe B would be for black, so\nyou can make it go to a black screen.\n\n335\n00:17:32.762 --> 00:17:33.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if you're in a-\n\n336\n00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:34.484\n&gt;&gt; Jam, [LAUGH] yeah.\n\n337\n00:17:34.484 --> 00:17:35.897\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, right?\n\n338\n00:17:35.897 --> 00:17:36.788\n&gt;&gt; I was just thinking of that.\n\n339\n00:17:36.788 --> 00:17:38.796\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's like okay all the lights are off.\n\n340\n00:17:38.796 --> 00:17:43.399\nOkay, maybe we should go back to the\nwhite, cuz it gives us a little bit more-\n\n341\n00:17:43.399 --> 00:17:44.458\n&gt;&gt; I think we insided that one,\n\n342\n00:17:44.458 --> 00:17:46.100\nwe didn't tell them what we were thinking.\n\n343\n00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.988\nBut if you're given a presentation, a lot\nof times all the lights in the auditorium,\n\n344\n00:17:49.988 --> 00:17:51.504\nfor example are turned way down.\n\n345\n00:17:51.504 --> 00:17:54.237\nThe only light in the room is\nreally coming from the projection.\n\n346\n00:17:54.237 --> 00:17:55.066\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Power Point presentations.\n\n347\n00:17:55.066 --> 00:17:56.591\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and when you end your show,\n\n348\n00:17:56.591 --> 00:18:00.039\nthey turn the lights back, they bring\nthe house lights up, or what have you.\n\n349\n00:18:00.039 --> 00:18:03.617\nBut if you hit that B and go to a black\nscreen, well some people start screaming.\n\n350\n00:18:03.617 --> 00:18:04.686\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They're like, wait, what happened?\n\n351\n00:18:04.686 --> 00:18:05.196\nWhere'd the lights go?\n\n352\n00:18:05.196 --> 00:18:06.415\nSo yeah, do be careful with that one.\n\n353\n00:18:06.415 --> 00:18:09.312\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, yes, yes.\n\n354\n00:18:09.312 --> 00:18:10.963\nMake sure you feel the room out.\n\n355\n00:18:10.963 --> 00:18:12.200\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n356\n00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:12.931\n&gt;&gt; Where am I?\n\n357\n00:18:12.931 --> 00:18:17.737\nSo I'm back in here, so just the keyboard\nshortcuts can be kind of fun.\n\n358\n00:18:17.737 --> 00:18:21.743\nThe other thing is,\nthe little buttons down here,\n\n359\n00:18:21.743 --> 00:18:27.254\nyou have your advance and back buttons\non the bottom left hand corner.\n\n360\n00:18:27.254 --> 00:18:30.056\nBut there's some other neat things that\nare in the bottom left hand corner.\n\n361\n00:18:30.056 --> 00:18:35.076\nThere's this little button right here of\nhow you can change how your mouse looks.\n\n362\n00:18:35.076 --> 00:18:38.948\nInstead of having it as a mouse,\nyou can do a laser pointer.\n\n363\n00:18:38.948 --> 00:18:41.149\nLike, ooh, let's talk about here.\n\n364\n00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:44.122\nI have to use my track pad, cuz it gets\nreally slow with my mouse for some reason.\n\n365\n00:18:44.122 --> 00:18:46.430\nSo I'm going there, but\nnow it's like, okay.\n\n366\n00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.317\nHow do I advance the slide, right?\n\n367\n00:18:48.317 --> 00:18:50.303\nCuz like, I can't click my mouse anymore.\n\n368\n00:18:50.303 --> 00:18:52.614\nThat's where using those\nkeyboards would work.\n\n369\n00:18:52.614 --> 00:18:55.628\nOr, you can come back down here and\nuse the buttons.\n\n370\n00:18:55.628 --> 00:18:58.425\nWe really want to concentrate\non here on Fuego.\n\n371\n00:18:58.425 --> 00:19:01.029\nSo the laser pointer is one, but\nthe other thing you can do is,\n\n372\n00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:03.430\nyou can do something as\nannotate your slides.\n\n373\n00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.080\nYou can come over here to your pen.\n\n374\n00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.916\nAnd when you have your pen,\nyou can then come over and say, all right,\n\n375\n00:19:08.916 --> 00:19:12.953\nwell let's go ahead and draw a big old\nheart around these little kitties,\n\n376\n00:19:12.953 --> 00:19:14.082\nthere you go [LAUGH].\n\n377\n00:19:14.082 --> 00:19:17.270\nAnd you have to change your voice,\nof course [LAUGH].\n\n378\n00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:20.140\nSo you could go ahead and\nannotate your slides and\n\n379\n00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.996\nsay like I really want to draw\nattention to this guy, right here.\n\n380\n00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:26.566\nSo you can use that and\nthen using your keyboard or\n\n381\n00:19:26.566 --> 00:19:29.960\nthe different buttons down here,\nyou can advance your slides.\n\n382\n00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.315\nAt the end of the slide\npresentation it will ask,\n\n383\n00:19:34.315 --> 00:19:36.581\ndo you want to keep your annotations.\n\n384\n00:19:36.581 --> 00:19:40.822\nIt's up to you, I'm not sure people really\nwanna see all my drawings on my slides.\n\n385\n00:19:40.822 --> 00:19:45.111\nBut while I'm presenting, it's kinda\nlike we'd always go to the board and\n\n386\n00:19:45.111 --> 00:19:46.060\nstart drawing.\n\n387\n00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.725\nIt's just a thing we have, like,\nhey, let me demonstrate this.\n\n388\n00:19:48.725 --> 00:19:51.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you have your different pens and\n\n389\n00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.160\nthe highlighter would be the same idea.\n\n390\n00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.340\nIf you really want to say that\nFuego is a flame point and he is.\n\n391\n00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.260\nHe's a flame point Siamese.\n\n392\n00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.280\nSo you have the different\nparts right there.\n\n393\n00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:06.500\nAnother thing we have is that button\nnext to it is where you can come out and\n\n394\n00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.220\nyou can quickly jump around your slides.\n\n395\n00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.360\nSo think about a long presentation,\nyou're like, that's a great point,\n\n396\n00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.310\nlet's talk about that now.\n\n397\n00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.950\nAnd you have it way down there,\nyou can just jump in here.\n\n398\n00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:18.530\nLet's go ahead and go to slide nine.\n\n399\n00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:20.640\nAnd then you can quickly kinda jump in and\nout.\n\n400\n00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.775\nNow, of course, people are kinda\nseeing the behind the scenes.\n\n401\n00:20:22.775 --> 00:20:23.899\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n402\n00:20:23.899 --> 00:20:26.140\n&gt;&gt; But\nit's up to you on how you want to do that.\n\n403\n00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.510\nAnd you can see that I\nalso have my sections, so\n\n404\n00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:33.550\nit will kinda jump to those different\nplaces that I had designated as sections\n\n405\n00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.120\nwithin my PowerPoint presentation.\n\n406\n00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.770\nAnd then I can just click this back\nbutton and I can keep on going.\n\n407\n00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:39.750\nI still have a highlighter.\n\n408\n00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:40.660\nOkay, that's fine.\n\n409\n00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:46.398\nSo the next button over, we have this guy,\nthis is our zoom button.\n\n410\n00:20:46.398 --> 00:20:49.382\nLet's go to another slide,\nbecause I think that would, whoops,\n\n411\n00:20:49.382 --> 00:20:50.792\nthere's my slide transitions.\n\n412\n00:20:50.792 --> 00:20:52.048\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nice one.\n\n413\n00:20:52.048 --> 00:20:53.854\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\nWhy don't we go to this one.\n\n414\n00:20:53.854 --> 00:20:55.800\nHey, easy way to get around.\n\n415\n00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.344\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n416\n00:20:57.344 --> 00:20:59.984\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a hidden slide, that's okay.\n\n417\n00:20:59.984 --> 00:21:04.165\nI take my zoom and\nI really wanna focus on here, and\n\n418\n00:21:04.165 --> 00:21:07.862\nit brings attention to that specific area.\n\n419\n00:21:07.862 --> 00:21:10.098\nCuz especially if you had\na really large chart, or\n\n420\n00:21:10.098 --> 00:21:12.876\nmaybe an orb chart that was taking\nup a lot of room on the slide.\n\n421\n00:21:12.876 --> 00:21:16.037\nAnd you really wanted to focus\non one particular department,\n\n422\n00:21:16.037 --> 00:21:17.326\nyou could use that zoom.\n\n423\n00:21:17.326 --> 00:21:19.787\nAnd then I was like well,\nhow do I get out of it?\n\n424\n00:21:19.787 --> 00:21:21.013\nYou have to hit the escape key.\n\n425\n00:21:21.013 --> 00:21:25.564\nAnd the escape key will take you out,\nand then it'll zoom you back out.\n\n426\n00:21:25.564 --> 00:21:29.723\nAnd I don't want to have the highlighter\non anymore, so I'm going to go back down\n\n427\n00:21:29.723 --> 00:21:33.535\nto here and see how it's highlighted,\nthe highlighter is highlighted.\n\n428\n00:21:33.535 --> 00:21:35.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can just un-highlight it, and\n\n429\n00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:40.370\nnow I've got my regular advancing\nthe slides by clicking the mouse.\n\n430\n00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:44.800\nAnd my mouse has disappeared yet,\nthere we go, okay [LAUGH].\n\n431\n00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.730\nThe last button I wanna show you\nis the little, well, three dots,\n\n432\n00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:54.001\nno other way to describe it besides\nthat and there you go [LAUGH].\n\n433\n00:21:54.001 --> 00:21:54.566\nMore.\n\n434\n00:21:54.566 --> 00:21:58.855\n[LAUGH] You could see that you\nhave some different options here.\n\n435\n00:21:58.855 --> 00:22:00.645\nLike your arrow options.\n\n436\n00:22:00.645 --> 00:22:03.605\nMaybe I don't want the arrow\nto be there at all.\n\n437\n00:22:03.605 --> 00:22:04.355\nYou can hide it.\n\n438\n00:22:04.355 --> 00:22:07.710\nMine keeps hiding and\nI don't really want it to.\n\n439\n00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:12.440\nThe other one I wanted to show you was\nthe presenter mode or presenter view.\n\n440\n00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.320\nThis is awesome.\n\n441\n00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.480\nI really like this.\n\n442\n00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.930\nAnd this is going to be really\ngood if you have dual monitors or\n\n443\n00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:22.230\nyou have your laptop and\nhow the projector is projecting.\n\n444\n00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:25.808\nYou could control, this is what I\nwant my laptop to look like, but\n\n445\n00:22:25.808 --> 00:22:28.949\nthe other monitor is gonna\nactually have the slide show.\n\n446\n00:22:28.949 --> 00:22:33.327\nI've actually done this quite a few\ntimes with giving online presentations,\n\n447\n00:22:33.327 --> 00:22:36.524\nwhere I was on something,\nSkype, something like that.\n\n448\n00:22:36.524 --> 00:22:40.032\nAnd I had it displaying my\nslides on one monitor, but\n\n449\n00:22:40.032 --> 00:22:42.360\nthe other monitor I had this view.\n\n450\n00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.430\nSo I can know what was coming up.\n\n451\n00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:45.960\nI know what my next slide going to be.\n\n452\n00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.530\nIt also has my speaker notes right there.\n\n453\n00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:53.275\nAnd it can be really handy for you as\na presenter to know what's coming, and so\n\n454\n00:22:53.275 --> 00:22:55.619\nyou can kind of help control the show.\n\n455\n00:22:55.619 --> 00:22:59.761\nSo that is what the presenter view looks\nlike, and you could always force yourself\n\n456\n00:22:59.761 --> 00:23:03.017\nto go into it, when you're in\nthe middle of your presentation.\n\n457\n00:23:03.017 --> 00:23:04.675\nBut since I only have one monitor,\n\n458\n00:23:04.675 --> 00:23:07.546\nI just wanted to at least show\nyou what this looks like here.\n\n459\n00:23:07.546 --> 00:23:12.282\nAnd then I can go to the ellipses button,\nand we can go to hide the presentation or\n\n460\n00:23:12.282 --> 00:23:14.340\nthe presenter view.\n\n461\n00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:18.730\nAnd go back to our regular slides and\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n462\n00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:23.350\nquickly run through the rest\nof the animation, go go go.\n\n463\n00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.445\nAnd by the way the keyboard shortcuts\nthat I was telling you about,\n\n464\n00:23:26.445 --> 00:23:27.834\nI do have a link on that slide.\n\n465\n00:23:27.834 --> 00:23:30.266\nSo that way you guys can have references,\n\n466\n00:23:30.266 --> 00:23:34.620\nbecause you're like what was the what\nwas the W the the the P and the B?\n\n467\n00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.300\nSo I went ahead and put that in there and\nthen I wanted to also show you that at\n\n468\n00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:42.150\nthe end of this is going to give me\nthat warning of like do you want to\n\n469\n00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:47.270\nkeep your ink annotations and\nI do not so I'm gonna go ahead discard.\n\n470\n00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.670\nAnd there we go.\n\n471\n00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.290\nSo, that is just running the show.\n\n472\n00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:54.250\nBut I would like to go over some other\nthings, like we talked about, well,\n\n473\n00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:58.330\nI'm going to Chicago, I've got my laptop\nand I'm ready to go, and that's great.\n\n474\n00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:01.950\nBut what if you're not bringing your\nown laptop or your work laptop?\n\n475\n00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:08.120\nAnd they've told you that there will be\na computer at the presentation hall and\n\n476\n00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:13.840\nthat you'll be able to use that, so\nHow do I transport my presentation?\n\n477\n00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.086\nAnd we're going to go over\na lot of different options, and\n\n478\n00:24:17.086 --> 00:24:20.209\ndifferent scenarios as to why\nyou would want to do what?\n\n479\n00:24:20.209 --> 00:24:26.316\nSo I'd like to go through the sharing and\nexport options in our file tab.\n\n480\n00:24:26.316 --> 00:24:29.346\nSo lets jump on in there and go over\nto the file tab, cuz I had already,\n\n481\n00:24:29.346 --> 00:24:32.224\nremember I had already saved this but\nI'm not doing it right now on\n\n482\n00:24:32.224 --> 00:24:33.010\nscreen [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n483\n00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:35.180\n&gt;&gt; So you guys can.\n\n484\n00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.320\nWe have Share, Export.\n\n485\n00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:39.825\nShare, okay.\n\n486\n00:24:39.825 --> 00:24:40.535\nWhat am I going to do?\n\n487\n00:24:40.535 --> 00:24:41.985\nI'm gonna share it with people.\n\n488\n00:24:41.985 --> 00:24:47.945\nThis is where maybe I wanted to send\nit to Mike because he's my partner and\n\n489\n00:24:47.945 --> 00:24:49.855\nI want to quickly get it to him.\n\n490\n00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:53.315\nOneDrive is a great way to do that.\n\n491\n00:24:53.315 --> 00:24:54.915\nWhat is OneDrive?\n\n492\n00:24:54.915 --> 00:24:59.415\nIt's a lot like DropBox or Google Drive,\nbut it's Microsoft specific.\n\n493\n00:24:59.415 --> 00:25:02.870\nAnd because it's Microsoft\nspecific It's tied right in with\n\n494\n00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:05.080\nall of the applications,\nwhich makes it really easy, and\n\n495\n00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:10.610\nof course you get that when you have\nyour 365 or any type of Office account.\n\n496\n00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.480\nYou can just upload it and\nshare it right up into your One Drive.\n\n497\n00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.720\nSo it's a great way then you can go\nahead and send that person the link,\n\n498\n00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.470\nand then they can grab it.\n\n499\n00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.140\nAnd do what they need with it?\n\n500\n00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:24.440\nSo I really like to use your OneDrive or\nsave to the cloud.\n\n501\n00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.775\nWhoops, wrong key.\n\n502\n00:25:25.775 --> 00:25:29.750\n[LAUGH] All right,\nwhat if I want to email this to Mike?\n\n503\n00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.750\nWell, this would work great\nif you had Outlook set up.\n\n504\n00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:36.580\nIf you don't have Outlook set up,\nit's not gonna work seamlessly the way it\n\n505\n00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:40.840\nis intended, this particular option\nof sharing is going to intend.\n\n506\n00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.220\nOr is meant to do.\n\n507\n00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:48.681\nSo, if I did have it, and I chose save\nas attachment, it would go ahead and\n\n508\n00:25:48.681 --> 00:25:54.251\nautomatically open up Outlook,\nget it in a message, have that attached.\n\n509\n00:25:54.251 --> 00:25:57.297\nAnd then I can go ahead and put in\nwho I want to put in my contacts and\n\n510\n00:25:57.297 --> 00:25:59.690\nthe title of it, and\nI can just send it right off.\n\n511\n00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:00.430\nIt's really, really handy.\n\n512\n00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:01.000\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n513\n00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.126\nBut if you don't have Outlook,\nit's not gonna work.\n\n514\n00:26:04.126 --> 00:26:06.669\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Along the same line with\n\n515\n00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:08.790\nOutlook, sending it as a PDF.\n\n516\n00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:14.020\nOkay, so why would I wanna send\nit as a PDF versus PowerPoint?\n\n517\n00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.870\nWhat if Mike doesn't have PowerPoint?\n\n518\n00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:21.202\nBut I need to get him a copy of\nthe presentation because he's going to be\n\n519\n00:26:21.202 --> 00:26:26.061\npresenting with me, but he didn't build\nit and he doesn't have PowerPoint.\n\n520\n00:26:26.061 --> 00:26:31.642\nBut if I send it as a PDF then it’s\njust a PDF, he can open that with a PDF\n\n521\n00:26:31.642 --> 00:26:36.850\nreader whatever variety and\nhe can still see everything as is.\n\n522\n00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:41.332\nNow he can't edit it, he can't do any of\nlike, it doesn't have the animations but\n\n523\n00:26:41.332 --> 00:26:43.199\nit does give the presentation as.\n\n524\n00:26:43.199 --> 00:26:47.176\nThe presentation and so he can see it.\n\n525\n00:26:47.176 --> 00:26:52.168\nXPS, that's Microsoft's fun try,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n526\n00:26:52.168 --> 00:26:55.880\n&gt;&gt; At their own PDF file format.\n\n527\n00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.683\nI can tell you I've never used it.\n\n528\n00:26:58.683 --> 00:27:00.236\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sorry Microsoft but\n\n529\n00:27:00.236 --> 00:27:01.070\nI just haven't.\n\n530\n00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:02.134\nI mean PDF is a PDF.\n\n531\n00:27:02.134 --> 00:27:06.860\nSo that is what that particular\nfile format is all about.\n\n532\n00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.078\nAnd I can't tell you\nthe last time I sent a fax.\n\n533\n00:27:09.078 --> 00:27:10.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n534\n00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.415\n&gt;&gt; But if you wanted to do that you can\n\n535\n00:27:13.415 --> 00:27:14.270\ndo that.\n\n536\n00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.050\nNow going over a few other ones.\n\n537\n00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:17.080\nPresent online.\n\n538\n00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.577\nThis is another one.\n\n539\n00:27:20.577 --> 00:27:24.063\nIt is an option that PowerPoint or\nMicrosoft has for\n\n540\n00:27:24.063 --> 00:27:26.340\nyou to present this in real time.\n\n541\n00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.390\nLike in a session.\n\n542\n00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:30.815\nIt is very glitchy.\n\n543\n00:27:30.815 --> 00:27:31.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n544\n00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:33.850\n&gt;&gt; I tried.\nI really tried to get this in it.\n\n545\n00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:34.750\nI couldn't even get it set up.\n\n546\n00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:39.290\nI couldn't even get up\nthe office presentation service.\n\n547\n00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:42.417\nAgain, sorry Microsoft, but\nto avoid conflict or issues,\n\n548\n00:27:42.417 --> 00:27:43.776\nI would say just go ahead.\n\n549\n00:27:43.776 --> 00:27:47.789\nAnd if you're doing an online presentation\nI would use Skype which is another\n\n550\n00:27:47.789 --> 00:27:51.617\nMicrosoft service where you could go\nahead and run a Skype presentation,\n\n551\n00:27:51.617 --> 00:27:53.424\nhave everybody join the meeting.\n\n552\n00:27:53.424 --> 00:27:56.844\nAnd then you'd go ahead and present\nthe presentation from your laptop and\n\n553\n00:27:56.844 --> 00:27:57.790\nshare your screen.\n\n554\n00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:00.634\nThat would be a lot easier\nthan trying to use this one.\n\n555\n00:28:00.634 --> 00:28:04.584\nAnd that of course published slides\nwould be if you have access to\n\n556\n00:28:04.584 --> 00:28:06.180\na SharePoint site.\n\n557\n00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.328\nThis is only if you're in an organization\nthat does use SharePoint,\n\n558\n00:28:09.328 --> 00:28:12.710\nif you don't know what SharePoint is\nthen don't use this option, okay?\n\n559\n00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:13.462\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n560\n00:28:13.462 --> 00:28:16.327\nif you do use SharePoint\n&gt;&gt; Your organization has probably\n\n561\n00:28:16.327 --> 00:28:19.615\nalready given you some sort of\nguidance on how to use SharePoint and\n\n562\n00:28:19.615 --> 00:28:22.506\nhow you can check in and\nout your files and be able to use it.\n\n563\n00:28:22.506 --> 00:28:27.710\nIt's like an almost internal site for\nyour business.\n\n564\n00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.490\nThat's the nutshell of what SharePoint.\n\n565\n00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.834\nI know you work and\nsetup SharePoint servers, and all that.\n\n566\n00:28:31.834 --> 00:28:32.770\n&gt;&gt; It's good stuff.\n\n567\n00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:33.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] so, but\n\n568\n00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:38.100\nwe'll just leave it for\n&gt;&gt; Use it only if you have SharePoint.\n\n569\n00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:41.220\nJust a few more options, we'll go\nover to the Export because Share and\n\n570\n00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.080\nExport it's almost the same thing.\n\n571\n00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.770\nAnd actually it has somewhat\nvery similar options.\n\n572\n00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:51.350\nLike right here Export,\ncreate a PDF or XPS document.\n\n573\n00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:53.800\n&gt;&gt; Well you could really do this\nif you just did a file save as and\n\n574\n00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.360\nchanged the file format.\n\n575\n00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.210\nSo many different ways to do this,\nbut it's just saying, hey,\n\n576\n00:28:58.210 --> 00:28:59.970\ndo you want to create a PDF out of this?\n\n577\n00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:01.030\nAnd it will go ahead and do that.\n\n578\n00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:02.829\nDo you want to create a video?\n\n579\n00:29:02.829 --> 00:29:05.580\nNow, that would change it to,\nI believe it's a MP4.\n\n580\n00:29:06.668 --> 00:29:12.540\nFile because you just want it to be\na video, and that way you can see it.\n\n581\n00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:13.470\nYou can upload it to the web,\n\n582\n00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:18.300\nyou can maybe put it on YouTube because\nmaybe you have this awesome slide show.\n\n583\n00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.040\nPictures, right?\n\n584\n00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:23.300\nYou wanna show all the pictures of\nour beach trips and things like that,\n\n585\n00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.437\nyou could do that.\n\n586\n00:29:24.437 --> 00:29:29.322\nPackage for CD I don't remember the last\ntime I actually made a CD either.\n\n587\n00:29:29.322 --> 00:29:29.834\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n588\n00:29:29.834 --> 00:29:30.960\n&gt;&gt; But I don't want that to\n\n589\n00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.750\nthrow you because when we get into some\nfuture episodes where we're going to be\n\n590\n00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:39.080\nhaving external sound files or\nexternal video files.\n\n591\n00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.331\nWhen you have anything\nexternal connected or embed,\n\n592\n00:29:42.331 --> 00:29:46.460\nnot even embedded, inserted into\nyour PowerPoint presentation.\n\n593\n00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:50.291\nIt's kinda like by have it all in there,\nI just take the PowerPoint presentation,\n\n594\n00:29:50.291 --> 00:29:52.910\nyou don't have the rest connected to it.\n\n595\n00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:55.150\n&gt;&gt; Effect or something,\nit's not embedded yet.\n\n596\n00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:56.910\nSo\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly and so\n\n597\n00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.610\nyou get to somewhere where it's like,\nit's trying to find that sound\n\n598\n00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:01.680\nfile on you computer and\nyou're not on your computer anymore.\n\n599\n00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.870\nIt's like what happen?\n\n600\n00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:08.822\nSo packaging, think of it like creating an\nactual package not for a CD necessarily.\n\n601\n00:30:08.822 --> 00:30:09.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n602\n00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.040\n&gt;&gt; Packaging for you to transport.\n\n603\n00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.440\nAnd the other thing that it\ndoes is it will go ahead and\n\n604\n00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.020\ncreate that PowerPoint viewer.\n\n605\n00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.660\nSay you get to that Chicago,\nand they don't have PowerPoint.\n\n606\n00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.630\nMy gosh, I don't know what to do.\n\n607\n00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.176\nIf they don't have\nPowerPoint I can't run a show.\n\n608\n00:30:23.176 --> 00:30:28.082\nIf you run that, it creates that viewer\nadd in that you could just go ahead and\n\n609\n00:30:28.082 --> 00:30:30.250\nuse and it will run the show.\n\n610\n00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:33.730\nYou can't edit, but it will at least run\nthe PowerPoint presentation as it is.\n\n611\n00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:34.560\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n612\n00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.330\n&gt;&gt; Creating the handouts.\n\n613\n00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:39.750\nIt's really just exports out to Word.\n\n614\n00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:42.720\nRemember the print where it had\nthe slide with the lines on the side?\n\n615\n00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.286\nIt really just does that,\njust in a Word format.\n\n616\n00:30:45.286 --> 00:30:49.190\nI've done it but\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n617\n00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.824\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I just\n\n618\n00:30:49.824 --> 00:30:53.374\nwould use the premier but\nif you didn't wanna out add your notes and\n\n619\n00:30:53.374 --> 00:30:57.880\nuse a word processor could be a lot easier\nif you use create hand out for words.\n\n620\n00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.940\nAnd then the change file I decided this is\nwhere instead of going to export change\n\n621\n00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.060\nfile type we could have done the.\n\n622\n00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:06.813\nSave As right from this option here.\n\n623\n00:31:06.813 --> 00:31:09.610\nAnd these are all the different types\nof file formats that you can do it.\n\n624\n00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:14.330\nWe did talk about in the introduction,\nPPT versus PPTX.\n\n625\n00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:19.993\nIf I am sending this to somebody\nthat does not have 2007\n\n626\n00:31:19.993 --> 00:31:21.106\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n627\n00:31:21.106 --> 00:31:23.510\n&gt;&gt; Or higher, then if they're on 2003,\n\n628\n00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:27.840\nyou would have to save it as\nthe lower version of the file format.\n\n629\n00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.286\nAnd that would be PPt.\n\n630\n00:31:30.286 --> 00:31:34.444\nYou also have like some people use\nPowerPoint to create a flyer or\n\n631\n00:31:34.444 --> 00:31:36.910\na graphic that they want to print out.\n\n632\n00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:43.240\nSo you could actually save it as a JPEG,\nand then as a picture, an image.\n\n633\n00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.958\nAnd then you could go ahead and\n\n634\n00:31:44.958 --> 00:31:48.131\nsend it as a picture instead\nof a PowerPoint to people.\n\n635\n00:31:48.131 --> 00:31:50.470\nIf you have multiple slides\nit will ask you well,\n\n636\n00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:53.890\nwhich slide do you want me to make a JPEG,\none or all of them?\n\n637\n00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:54.770\nSo you can see that.\n\n638\n00:31:54.770 --> 00:32:00.927\nAnd then the other one just to make\na mention is the Powerpoint show, PPS.\n\n639\n00:32:00.927 --> 00:32:04.202\nThat's where it will only open\nup in like the show view,\n\n640\n00:32:04.202 --> 00:32:09.009\nit will never open up in this environment\nwhere we have our ribbons, and our tabs,\n\n641\n00:32:09.009 --> 00:32:11.955\nand our edits and\neverything that we can do for it.\n\n642\n00:32:11.955 --> 00:32:17.775\nIt's just like a finished show that runs\nas a show, and you get no other options.\n\n643\n00:32:17.775 --> 00:32:22.420\nSo those are some different\noptions of how and\n\n644\n00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:26.050\nwhat type of files and why you would\nwant to use your different file types.\n\n645\n00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:31.440\nSo it pretty much covers everything that\nyou need when you're ready to go and\n\n646\n00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.120\nget up and talk to people and\n\n647\n00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.515\nstand in front of the room and\ntry not to get too nervous.\n\n648\n00:32:36.515 --> 00:32:39.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And present your presentation.\n\n649\n00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:40.320\n&gt;&gt; Alright Vonne.\n\n650\n00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.550\nFantastic stuff there.\n\n651\n00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:43.230\nWay to tie it all together.\n\n652\n00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:46.860\nWe spend a lot of time getting\nour presentation edited,\n\n653\n00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:48.380\nall the information in there.\n\n654\n00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:52.960\nBut now it's time to present and we need\nthis to be able to deliver it in different\n\n655\n00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.850\nmediums or different locations depending\nwhat type of equipment we have.\n\n656\n00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:59.260\nSo we thank you for that Vonne.\n\n657\n00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.380\nI hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one and\n\n658\n00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.040\nis ready to give their\nPowerPoint presentation.\n\n659\n00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.340\nBut for now, signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n660\n00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.180\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n661\n00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:15.566\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n662\n00:33:15.566 --> 00:33:16.078\n[MUSIC]\n\n663\n00:33:16.078 --> 00:33:18.229\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
