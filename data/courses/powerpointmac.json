You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.226 --> 00:00:14.334\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n7\n00:00:14.334 --> 00:00:16.780\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.000\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n9\n00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.190\nin today's episode we are beginning\nour series on PowerPoint 2016 for Mac.\n\n10\n00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.430\nThat's right,\nthe new hotness from Microsoft.\n\n11\n00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.890\nAnd joining me in the studio to lend\nher expertise on that very topic,\n\n12\n00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.750\nour good friend, Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n13\n00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.358\nVonne, how's it going today?\n\n14\n00:00:32.358 --> 00:00:37.200\n&gt;&gt; Good, I'm glad to be here for\nanother exciting round of PowerPoint.\n\n15\n00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.760\nWe're gonna be doing it\nthrough the Mac this time.\n\n16\n00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.980\nSo I do have a whole series\non PowerPoint for Windows.\n\n17\n00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.524\nAnd so we wanted to make an entire\nthing for Mac, because well,\n\n18\n00:00:46.524 --> 00:00:49.070\nyou could probably say,\nit's just pretty much the same.\n\n19\n00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.705\nIf you do PowerPoint on PC,\nit's the same on a Mac, it's not.\n\n20\n00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:55.605\nThere are significant differences.\n\n21\n00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:59.595\nAnd it's kind of like, if it's not in\nyour environment the way that you're used\n\n22\n00:00:59.595 --> 00:01:03.672\nto looking at, sometimes I think it can\nbe, it's kinda hard to kinda translate.\n\n23\n00:01:03.672 --> 00:01:05.802\nSo we figure,\nlet's not do any translation.\n\n24\n00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:07.442\nLet's just give it to you in Mac.\n\n25\n00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:08.452\n&gt;&gt; And that makes total sense.\n\n26\n00:01:08.452 --> 00:01:11.224\nLet's make the exact same\nproduct completely different.\n\n27\n00:01:11.224 --> 00:01:12.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hey, it works out for\n\n28\n00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.992\nus because we get to do twice the content\nfor you good folks out there.\n\n29\n00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:18.962\nSo if you're a Mac enthusiast or\nif you're a Windows enthusiast,\n\n30\n00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:20.828\nwe like to cover all of the bases, right?\n\n31\n00:01:20.828 --> 00:01:21.360\nNot leave anybody out.\n\n32\n00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.195\nWe're very inclusive here.\n\n33\n00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:26.560\nSo Vonne, that being said,\nwhere do we begin?\n\n34\n00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.980\n&gt;&gt; So I actually have a PowerPoint\npresentation on PowerPoint.\n\n35\n00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.840\nIsn't that a lovely thing there?\n\n36\n00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.770\n&gt;&gt; Very interesting.\n\n37\n00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.332\nI'm pretty sure that's one of those\nthings that causes the universe to\n\n38\n00:01:35.332 --> 00:01:36.067\nimplode on itself.\n\n39\n00:01:36.067 --> 00:01:38.342\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nit kind of like we don't understand.\n\n40\n00:01:38.342 --> 00:01:40.780\n&gt;&gt; No, we actually fire up PowerPoint and\ntalk about PowerPoint.\n\n41\n00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.880\nIt's the end of all human life.\n\n42\n00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.270\n&gt;&gt; It's a meeting to have a meeting.\n\n43\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n44\n00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.420\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, we all know about that.\n\n45\n00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.110\nAnd speaking of meetings, you might have\nbeen in an office meeting where somebody\n\n46\n00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.750\nis giving a PowerPoint presentation\nin that meeting and so\n\n47\n00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.990\nthat's exactly what PowerPoint is.\n\n48\n00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.060\nIf we come down into this file, you can\nsee that PowerPoint is a presentation\n\n49\n00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.550\napplication within the Office Suite\nof applications or programs or\n\n50\n00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.810\nsoftware, whichever word you really wanna\nuse when talking about these programs.\n\n51\n00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.665\nI'm using the word to\nexplain the word again.\n\n52\n00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No real way around that, is there?\n\n53\n00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.990\nIt's like, it's a program,\nit's an application.\n\n54\n00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.340\nSix to one,\nhalf a dozen of the other, right?\n\n55\n00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.405\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes.\n\n56\n00:02:20.405 --> 00:02:23.045\nAnd so this product does presentations.\n\n57\n00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:28.035\nWord would be your word processing, Excel\nwould be your spreadsheet application,\n\n58\n00:02:28.035 --> 00:02:31.205\nOutlook would be your your email software.\n\n59\n00:02:31.205 --> 00:02:33.395\nSo this one works with presentations.\n\n60\n00:02:33.395 --> 00:02:36.305\nAnd a presentation is composed of slides,\nand\n\n61\n00:02:36.305 --> 00:02:40.210\nwhen you give a slideshow,\nit is a slideshow.\n\n62\n00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.955\nWow, we're just circling around,\naren't we?\n\n63\n00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:44.924\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't think this is from here,\n\n64\n00:02:44.924 --> 00:02:45.978\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n65\n00:02:45.978 --> 00:02:47.630\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Enjoy.\n\n66\n00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.180\n&gt;&gt; You're going to be presenting\nyour slides in a slideshow.\n\n67\n00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.020\nAnd those do kind of correlate with\nthe different things in the environment,\n\n68\n00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.430\nwhich we will be going over when we\ntalk about our ribbon and our menus.\n\n69\n00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.200\nYou can probably already\nstart seeing them around.\n\n70\n00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.320\nAs you can see,\nthere are slideshows and slideshows.\n\n71\n00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.728\n&gt;&gt; There's interesting buttons and\nicons all around this thing.\n\n72\n00:03:05.728 --> 00:03:08.540\nSo I assume we'll eventually get\ninto that and see what they do.\n\n73\n00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.200\n&gt;&gt; We will, we will.\n\n74\n00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.160\nRight now we're kind of starting\nout with the basic, basic,\n\n75\n00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.932\nlet's just start from the very,\nvery beginning.\n\n76\n00:03:13.932 --> 00:03:17.260\n&gt;&gt; So I'm a person,\nI've never seen PowerPoint before.\n\n77\n00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.050\nI know that it does presentations.\n\n78\n00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.710\nIt's a presentation software\nsuite of some sort.\n\n79\n00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.810\nNow I need to be able to\ncreate presentations.\n\n80\n00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.240\nSo I assume that's where\nwe're gonna begin.\n\n81\n00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.900\nI've installed PowerPoint.\n\n82\n00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.210\nI've launched it.\n\n83\n00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.397\nI wanna make my first slide.\n\n84\n00:03:31.397 --> 00:03:34.430\nI guess that's a good spot to jump in.\n\n85\n00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.960\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but\nthat'll be be next episode actually.\n\n86\n00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.730\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n87\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.820\n&gt;&gt; We have even more to learn.\n\n88\n00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.275\nWe need back story, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n89\n00:03:39.275 --> 00:03:41.598\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna talk about Bill Gates and\n\n90\n00:03:41.598 --> 00:03:43.168\nhis life growing up as a child.\n\n91\n00:03:43.168 --> 00:03:46.540\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like to start from, I assume nothing.\n\n92\n00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.950\nI assume you've never even looked at this,\n\n93\n00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.240\nyou didn't even know it was a presentation\nproduct until I just told you.\n\n94\n00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.070\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n95\n00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.810\n&gt;&gt; So we're starting even\nfurther back from there,\n\n96\n00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.174\nbut I like where you're going and\nI will get you there, I promise.\n\n97\n00:03:59.174 --> 00:03:59.859\n&gt;&gt; I can't wait.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n98\n00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:00.359\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n99\n00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.330\n&gt;&gt; But talking about PowerPoint as part of\n\n100\n00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.108\nthe Office Suite of applications,\nI went ahead and put this slide in here.\n\n101\n00:04:06.108 --> 00:04:07.840\nThat just gave you kind of an overview.\n\n102\n00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.050\nThere might be some products in\n\n103\n00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.450\nthere that you've never even seen before,\n\n104\n00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.410\nmaybe Vizio or Infopath or Project.\nSome of those,\n\n105\n00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.520\nmaybe I would say, lesser known of\nthe applications within the Office Suite.\n\n106\n00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.618\nBut they are part of it, and there's\nsome over here on the side that I went\n\n107\n00:04:22.618 --> 00:04:25.740\nahead and included,\nSway teams and SharePoint.\n\n108\n00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.200\nIt really all depends on\nwhat product plan you have.\n\n109\n00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.170\nWhat access do you have,\nwhether you've purchased it individually\n\n110\n00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.970\nas your own consumer, or\nif you're part of organization?\n\n111\n00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.320\nWhat version of Office 365 your\norganization has purchased for\n\n112\n00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.737\nyou, so it really doesn't-\n&gt;&gt; You mean this costs me money?\n\n113\n00:04:44.737 --> 00:04:46.898\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I gotta pay for this?\n\n114\n00:04:46.898 --> 00:04:49.210\n&gt;&gt; Well, actually no,\nthere is a free version.\n\n115\n00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.210\n&gt;&gt; But wait, there's more?\n\n116\n00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.030\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n117\n00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.158\n&gt;&gt; If you act now-\n&gt;&gt; So I went ahead and\n\n118\n00:04:53.158 --> 00:04:57.048\nput this slide in here, and\nthere's a link down here at the bottom,\n\n119\n00:04:57.048 --> 00:04:59.520\nthat you can visit the Microsoft website.\n\n120\n00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.260\nThat will go ahead and give you\nan overview of Microsoft for Mac and\n\n121\n00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.700\nwhat is available to you.\n\n122\n00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.380\nAnd so definitely check that out.\n\n123\n00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.102\nBecause you do have to consider, well, am\nI purchasing this as a stand-alone install\n\n124\n00:05:12.102 --> 00:05:14.511\nor am I purchasing this as an Office 365?\n\n125\n00:05:14.511 --> 00:05:19.088\nBecause that's the whole thing that\nwe're going with in this slide,\n\n126\n00:05:19.088 --> 00:05:22.968\nis that when you purchase\na subscription to Office 365,\n\n127\n00:05:22.968 --> 00:05:28.260\nyou are getting a subscription that you\nare able to access any of these products.\n\n128\n00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.010\nAnd be able to download it on\ndifferent versions of your machine.\n\n129\n00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.449\nNow as that Office 365 subscriber,\nI can then install\n\n130\n00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.562\nPowerPoint, or Word or\nExcel locally to my machine.\n\n131\n00:05:42.562 --> 00:05:47.060\nAnd then it becomes PowerPoint 2016,\nwhich is kinda weird.\n\n132\n00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.220\nWell, wait, which one am I?\n\n133\n00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.111\nI thought I had Office 365.\n\n134\n00:05:49.111 --> 00:05:50.440\nWell, you do.\n\n135\n00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.819\nBut you also have PowerPoint 2016.\n\n136\n00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:56.218\nBecause back on those product\nplans on how you can purchase it,\n\n137\n00:05:56.218 --> 00:06:00.617\nyou could purchase it as a single\nstandalone install that has no\n\n138\n00:06:00.617 --> 00:06:05.040\nconnection to Office 365 as\na subscription-based model.\n\n139\n00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.130\nThe whole idea about having it\nas a subscription-based model\n\n140\n00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.470\nis that you get those updates.\n\n141\n00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.896\nIf they went ahead and created something\nfancy with maybe inserting pictures,\n\n142\n00:06:14.896 --> 00:06:16.558\nI'm totally making this up.\n\n143\n00:06:16.558 --> 00:06:19.624\nI don't think they have anything to do\nwith that, [LAUGH] but they went ahead and\n\n144\n00:06:19.624 --> 00:06:20.560\nadded a small feature.\n\n145\n00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.600\nThey go ahead and implement that, and\n\n146\n00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.810\nthen as a subscriber you get\nthose small incremental updates.\n\n147\n00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.537\nAs opposed to back in the day, you had\ndifferent versions of PowerPoint or\n\n148\n00:06:31.537 --> 00:06:36.189\nOffice, and you would have to wait\nyears before the next installation of\n\n149\n00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:38.262\nthe new version of the product.\n\n150\n00:06:38.262 --> 00:06:42.720\nBut you can still buy Office that way.\n\n151\n00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.380\nYou can buy Office 2016, get a disk.\n\n152\n00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.826\nI don't know if they make\nit on a disk anymore.\n\n153\n00:06:46.826 --> 00:06:47.623\n[LAUGH] Right?\n\n154\n00:06:47.623 --> 00:06:48.675\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you probably download it.\n\n155\n00:06:48.675 --> 00:06:51.768\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, but back in the day,\nyou get a CD and you install it, and\n\n156\n00:06:51.768 --> 00:06:52.900\neverything like that.\n\n157\n00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.403\nSo I just wanted to kinda clarify here\nthat I do have an Office 365 account,\n\n158\n00:06:57.403 --> 00:07:00.938\nbut I'm using this as a locally\ninstalled version of it, and\n\n159\n00:07:00.938 --> 00:07:02.976\nit becomes PowerPoint 2016.\n\n160\n00:07:02.976 --> 00:07:07.490\nBut back to what you were saying,\nDaniel, well, do I have to pay for this?\n\n161\n00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.528\nYou don't, actually.\n\n162\n00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:10.810\nIf you wanted,\nthey do have a free version.\n\n163\n00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:11.944\n&gt;&gt; I thought you were\ngonna say torrent sites.\n\n164\n00:07:11.944 --> 00:07:13.531\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know Vonne.\n\n165\n00:07:13.531 --> 00:07:14.532\nGotta watch her.\n\n166\n00:07:14.532 --> 00:07:16.572\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know you.\n\n167\n00:07:16.572 --> 00:07:18.238\nCome on now.\n\n168\n00:07:18.238 --> 00:07:20.940\nNo, we are legit here.\n\n169\n00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.860\nAnd we're saying that with a Microsoft\naccount that you can go ahead and\n\n170\n00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.862\nsign up for, you have access to\nthe online versions of these products and\n\n171\n00:07:30.862 --> 00:07:33.230\nthese different applications.\n\n172\n00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:38.200\nSo there is a PowerPoint Online that\nyou could use, and that is free.\n\n173\n00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.730\nIt is mobile, in the sense that you would\nhave to access that on your computer\n\n174\n00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.279\nthrough your browser with\nyour Internet connection.\n\n175\n00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:47.120\nAnd that's how you could access it.\n\n176\n00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.720\nSo you can use this in a free model.\n\n177\n00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:55.210\n&gt;&gt; And would that be as full featured as\nthat standalone download to your desktop?\n\n178\n00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.879\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of features that\nare the same, but just like with anything,\n\n179\n00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:02.490\nif this is the purchased version,\nI'm gonna have much more capability,\n\n180\n00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.370\nthe full capability of the software.\n\n181\n00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:09.070\nWith my 365 or my local installation\nof a purchased product.\n\n182\n00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.900\nBut a lot of the things that we're going\nto be doing you can still go ahead and\n\n183\n00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.250\ndo a lot of the basics in\nthe free online version.\n\n184\n00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.490\n&gt;&gt; So if I just need some make some\nquick and easy Powerpoint slides,\n\n185\n00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.900\nmaybe do a presentation\nat a work function or\n\n186\n00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.870\nmaybe some other organization I'm involved\nwith, I can use that free version.\n\n187\n00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.040\nBut if I do presentations\nprobably as my job,\n\n188\n00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.220\nI'm gonna wanna go with\nthe more fully functional.\n\n189\n00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.557\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly, that's how it goes.\n\n190\n00:08:33.557 --> 00:08:37.723\nAnd the nice thing about being in Office\n365 user is you could always access those\n\n191\n00:08:37.723 --> 00:08:39.220\nthat online version as well.\n\n192\n00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.444\nSo like you're saying if you're on the go,\nand you're at the airport or wherever you\n\n193\n00:08:43.444 --> 00:08:46.975\ncould go ahead and still do everything-\n&gt;&gt; You know what happens a lot is you show\n\n194\n00:08:46.975 --> 00:08:49.138\nup somewhere like yeah,\nI wanna do a presentation.\n\n195\n00:08:49.138 --> 00:08:50.771\nAnd they're like, here's your laptop.\n\n196\n00:08:50.771 --> 00:08:53.800\nThey give you a laptop that they use for\npresentations.\n\n197\n00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.713\nLook, it doesn't have what I need on it.\n\n198\n00:08:55.713 --> 00:08:56.702\nThat's awesome.\n\n199\n00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:59.242\nNow it doesn't matter, you just get\ninto the Cloud and there it is.\n\n200\n00:08:59.242 --> 00:09:00.589\nYou just launch it from there.\n\n201\n00:09:00.589 --> 00:09:02.899\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthen the whole idea with the One Drive,\n\n202\n00:09:02.899 --> 00:09:04.550\nOne Drive being a service that's.\n\n203\n00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:08.510\nIt's like Dropbox or Google Drive if\nyou're familiar with any of those terms.\n\n204\n00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.220\nBut it's just a storage location for\nyour files in the cloud for\n\n205\n00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:16.100\nyou to be able to access anywhere\nwith an internet connection.\n\n206\n00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.090\nSo talking about these different\nversions of PowerPoint we've been going.\n\n207\n00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.688\nI just wanted to give a history lesson or\n\n208\n00:09:22.688 --> 00:09:28.068\njust kinda a back story of the different\nversions that you have with PowerPoint.\n\n209\n00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:31.217\nWe're going only back to 2003\nin the PC version and back-\n\n210\n00:09:31.217 --> 00:09:32.310\n&gt;&gt; The last time I used PowerPoint.\n\n211\n00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.774\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n212\n00:09:33.774 --> 00:09:37.739\n[LAUGH] Back of course when they did the\nMac versions they always were a year off.\n\n213\n00:09:37.739 --> 00:09:38.601\nSo the PC and\n\n214\n00:09:38.601 --> 00:09:43.702\nWindows versions never really matched\nup in the sense of the numbers.\n\n215\n00:09:43.702 --> 00:09:46.428\nNow the nice thing is that PowerPoint for\n\n216\n00:09:46.428 --> 00:09:50.448\nMac really does look almost\nidentical to PowerPoint in PC.\n\n217\n00:09:50.448 --> 00:09:53.304\nSo the kind of switching\nof being bilingual,\n\n218\n00:09:53.304 --> 00:09:58.280\nbefore it was a little rough there\nswitching back and forth between products.\n\n219\n00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:04.520\nBut now, looking at PowerPoint or\nWord or Excel on PC and then looking\n\n220\n00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:09.183\non it on your Mac, it's more similar than\nit's ever been which is really nice.\n\n221\n00:10:09.183 --> 00:10:11.505\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that makes sense because you think\n\n222\n00:10:11.505 --> 00:10:14.402\nabout if you,\ngoing into history lessons, right?\n\n223\n00:10:14.402 --> 00:10:19.093\nWhere Mac was a completely different\narchitecture than PCs were.\n\n224\n00:10:19.093 --> 00:10:22.578\nAnd then all of a sudden one day they said\nyou know what, we're not going to do that\n\n225\n00:10:22.578 --> 00:10:26.078\nanymore, got Intel based Macintosh and\nyou've got Intel based PCs obviously.\n\n226\n00:10:26.078 --> 00:10:28.149\nNow you can start\nhomogenizing a lot of things.\n\n227\n00:10:28.149 --> 00:10:30.147\nSo I'm sure that opened the door for\nthat kind of thing.\n\n228\n00:10:30.147 --> 00:10:33.753\nAnd is nice because no matter what you\nuse, you're able to be familiar with\n\n229\n00:10:33.753 --> 00:10:36.167\nthe product regardless\nof the platform it's on.\n\n230\n00:10:36.167 --> 00:10:38.794\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah and\nbefore it was really different.\n\n231\n00:10:38.794 --> 00:10:40.111\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was night and day,\n\n232\n00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:41.427\nI don't even know where I'm at.\n\n233\n00:10:41.427 --> 00:10:42.707\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, are you sure this is PowerPoint?\n\n234\n00:10:42.707 --> 00:10:44.372\nDo you just name it PowerPoint?\n\n235\n00:10:44.372 --> 00:10:48.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah and so,\nin this slide I also wanted to point out\n\n236\n00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:52.136\nthe file extensions or file types because.\n\n237\n00:10:52.136 --> 00:10:56.425\nEvery file that's on your computer has\na type, it has an extension that it\n\n238\n00:10:56.425 --> 00:10:59.970\nrecognizes what program that\nit needs to talk in basically.\n\n239\n00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:04.065\nSo when you are working with PowerPoint,\nyou're doing a .pptx file format.\n\n240\n00:11:04.065 --> 00:11:05.813\nIf you're working in Word, it's a docx.\n\n241\n00:11:05.813 --> 00:11:07.924\nIf you're working in Excel it's xlsx.\n\n242\n00:11:07.924 --> 00:11:13.005\nBut before that back in the day you\nused to have PowerPoint .ppt and\n\n243\n00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:16.374\nthen that was back in the 2003 version.\n\n244\n00:11:16.374 --> 00:11:20.859\nAnd then when they went to 2007 they did a\nhuge upgrade on the entire suite and I'll\n\n245\n00:11:20.859 --> 00:11:25.300\nspare you all the details, but the whole\nS&amp;L formatting and everything like that.\n\n246\n00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.470\nBut is basically,\nit went from here to here.\n\n247\n00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.263\nAnd so they had to make a file\nformat that would allow for\n\n248\n00:11:30.263 --> 00:11:33.495\nall this extra capabilities that\nthe products were able to do.\n\n249\n00:11:33.495 --> 00:11:35.930\nAnd so that's why you have\nthose different versions.\n\n250\n00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.620\nNow, we're in 2017 right now, so we're\n\n251\n00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:44.440\nquite a ways away from having files back\nin that old version, if you wanna say.\n\n252\n00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.852\nBut I always like to point it out because\nit was a huge thing when they went to\n\n253\n00:11:48.852 --> 00:11:51.714\nthe 2007 version of all of their products.\n\n254\n00:11:51.714 --> 00:11:54.364\nPeople were like I can't talk to each\nother and I'm sending you files and\n\n255\n00:11:54.364 --> 00:11:55.890\nyou can't open them and it's like what?\n\n256\n00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:00.778\nSo just making yourself aware\nof the different file formats.\n\n257\n00:12:00.778 --> 00:12:03.242\nAnd I did include a link,\nit's really small, but\n\n258\n00:12:03.242 --> 00:12:07.118\nthere is a link in here that goes over\na whole bunch of different file extensions\n\n259\n00:12:07.118 --> 00:12:09.290\nspecifically with office products.\n\n260\n00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:14.347\nAnd that way you can get a little bit\nmore familiar with like what is a .potx,\n\n261\n00:12:14.347 --> 00:12:17.601\nwhat is .ppsx,\nthere's a lot of them in there.\n\n262\n00:12:17.601 --> 00:12:21.443\nSo definitely check that out and\nyou can go over some more of those.\n\n263\n00:12:21.443 --> 00:12:25.982\nContinuing on with FileX Works,\nextending our file extensions talk.\n\n264\n00:12:25.982 --> 00:12:26.710\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of wordplay in this show.\n\n265\n00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.592\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, right.\n\n266\n00:12:28.592 --> 00:12:30.012\nThere really is.\n\n267\n00:12:30.012 --> 00:12:35.530\nBut that in Mac, a lot of times you\nwill see the file extensions already but\n\n268\n00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.870\nnot all the time.\n\n269\n00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:41.386\nIt's weird, because I brought over\nsome files from PowerPoint that I\n\n270\n00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:44.150\nactually created on my Windows computer.\n\n271\n00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.710\nBrought it over to Mac and\nit was already showing in the extensions.\n\n272\n00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.002\nI'm like yeah, that's great.\nBut then you make some other files and\n\n273\n00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:52.920\nit's not showing the extensions,\nbecause I was creating them from my Mac.\n\n274\n00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.170\nI originated them on my Macintosh.\n\n275\n00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:59.729\nAnd so on the Finder, I see some\nwith extensions and some was not.\n\n276\n00:12:59.729 --> 00:13:01.748\nAnd I was like I don't\nknow what's going on.\n\n277\n00:13:01.748 --> 00:13:06.590\nIn your Finder preferences,\nyou can use your options in the advanced\n\n278\n00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:10.858\nto be able to show all file names and\nextensions at all times.\n\n279\n00:13:10.858 --> 00:13:15.684\nAnd that way you can start getting used\nto seeing what type of files are in here.\n\n280\n00:13:15.684 --> 00:13:21.431\nI do have a little screenshot of the list\nview in my finder that would show.\n\n281\n00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:24.703\nYou always wanna try look for\nthat what type of file is this and\n\n282\n00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:28.488\nyou can see that one with the PPTX and\nthat's the most recent version or\n\n283\n00:13:28.488 --> 00:13:31.720\nthe one we're gonna using but\nI do see one that's a dot PPT.\n\n284\n00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:37.060\nAnd so that would kind of just at least\nlet you know what type of files you're\n\n285\n00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:43.020\nworking with, what versions of them, and\nmaybe why your PPT file is not accepting.\n\n286\n00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.745\nLike when you put some new things into\nit and you go to to save and it's like,\n\n287\n00:13:45.745 --> 00:13:47.020\nI don't know what you're doing.\n\n288\n00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:52.013\nI can't understand what we're talking\nabout because the file format that I'm\n\n289\n00:13:52.013 --> 00:13:53.814\nworking in doesn't see it.\n\n290\n00:13:53.814 --> 00:13:55.730\nDoesn't allow it and I can't read that.\n\n291\n00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.207\nSo it's just always good to know\nabout different file extensions.\n\n292\n00:13:59.207 --> 00:14:01.301\nOne thing about renaming your files,\n\n293\n00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:06.152\nif you're renaming them from within your\nfinder, don't delete your file extension.\n\n294\n00:14:06.152 --> 00:14:09.387\nBecause then it starts to like,\nI don't know what this is,\n\n295\n00:14:09.387 --> 00:14:13.320\nyou kinda, didn't tell me,\nyou've lost what I know what it is.\n\n296\n00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.208\nSo if there's a dot and\nsomething after it, don't change that,\n\n297\n00:14:16.208 --> 00:14:17.690\nchange anything before the dot.\n\n298\n00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.277\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n299\n00:14:18.277 --> 00:14:21.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah,\ncuz then you kinda broke it.\n\n300\n00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:26.154\nAll right, so talking about Our Setup,\nwe are going to be using,\n\n301\n00:14:26.154 --> 00:14:29.753\nI have an Office 365\nPro Plus subscription and\n\n302\n00:14:29.753 --> 00:14:34.256\nit is locally installed and\nI am on the Sierra Mac Version OS.\n\n303\n00:14:34.256 --> 00:14:36.028\nAnd I have whatever\nthat version number is.\n\n304\n00:14:36.028 --> 00:14:38.233\nBut I know the version number\ndoes make a difference,\n\n305\n00:14:38.233 --> 00:14:40.293\nbecause when you start\ndoing different updates.\n\n306\n00:14:40.293 --> 00:14:45.240\nSometimes you do a system update, and\nthen it kinda throws some things off.\n\n307\n00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.080\nSo, not necessarily in Office, per se, but\n\n308\n00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.500\nI have had some other,\na lot of times it's online services.\n\n309\n00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.565\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That it's just like,\n\n310\n00:14:53.565 --> 00:14:54.968\nthis is a whole new operating system.\n\n311\n00:14:54.968 --> 00:14:58.654\n&gt;&gt; Sierra when it first came out, did so\nmany weird things with a lot of things\n\n312\n00:14:58.654 --> 00:15:01.937\nwe use here in our office that we\nwere calling it the Sierra virus.\n\n313\n00:15:01.937 --> 00:15:04.026\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz things were just going crazy.\n\n314\n00:15:04.026 --> 00:15:06.621\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm special,\nI have all sorts of special plugs.\n\n315\n00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:09.020\nI have to have special cables and\nall that good stuff and\n\n316\n00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.631\nit's not necessarily the operating system,\nmore of like I have a newer MacBook.\n\n317\n00:15:12.631 --> 00:15:14.955\nBut yes, it definitely does that way.\n\n318\n00:15:14.955 --> 00:15:18.247\nSo your setup, now how is this going\nto correlate to what you're using?\n\n319\n00:15:18.247 --> 00:15:19.592\nIf you're using PowerPoint for\n\n320\n00:15:19.592 --> 00:15:22.970\nMac 2016 then you're gonna look\npretty much exactly like I have.\n\n321\n00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:27.934\nThere might be some slight differences\ndepending on what version or what,\n\n322\n00:15:27.934 --> 00:15:32.051\nwe'll say update, you are in,\nin the office subscription.\n\n323\n00:15:32.051 --> 00:15:34.103\nBecause maybe they pushed\nout a new update and\n\n324\n00:15:34.103 --> 00:15:36.970\nthere's a new button on your\nribbon that I don't have.\n\n325\n00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.625\nWell, that could just be the same.\n\n326\n00:15:39.625 --> 00:15:43.679\nThe whole, you're updated further\nthan what I'm updated on.\n\n327\n00:15:43.679 --> 00:15:45.995\nAnd then all the basics\nare gonna be the same.\n\n328\n00:15:45.995 --> 00:15:50.931\nSo if you are using the online version or\neven if you came over from a PC,\n\n329\n00:15:50.931 --> 00:15:53.118\nall of the basics are the same.\n\n330\n00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:54.675\nThose don't go away.\n\n331\n00:15:54.675 --> 00:15:58.708\nSomething to notice,\nif you are in a large organization,\n\n332\n00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:03.172\nthere are different levels of\nsubscriptions in Office 365.\n\n333\n00:16:03.172 --> 00:16:08.224\nThere's Enterprise licenses that\nmight be a little bit different than\n\n334\n00:16:08.224 --> 00:16:12.950\nyou buying a Office for business and\nthen Office for personal use.\n\n335\n00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.610\nThere's slight differences.\n\n336\n00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.056\nIt could be something weird.\n\n337\n00:16:17.056 --> 00:16:21.220\nI know OneNote wasn't working\nproperly with something I was doing.\n\n338\n00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.870\nAnd that's where I did all these searches.\n\n339\n00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.710\nAnd it's something because we're on\nan Enterprise version rather than a for\n\n340\n00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:26.300\nbusiness.\n\n341\n00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:30.030\nIt was like okay, there's always those\nweird little quirks here and there.\n\n342\n00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.630\n&gt;&gt; Caveats, yeah.\n\n343\n00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:33.790\n&gt;&gt; Yes, those wonderful caveats\nthat get thrown in there.\n\n344\n00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:37.010\nSo I just wanted to throw\nthat out there for you.\n\n345\n00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.280\nAnd we are going to be getting\nstarted with some basics.\n\n346\n00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.210\nI always like to just cover everything.\n\n347\n00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:45.150\nBasic commands like File &gt; Open,\nFile &gt; Close, File &gt; Save.\n\n348\n00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:49.030\nWhat's the difference between\nfile save as, undo and shortcuts?\n\n349\n00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.430\nI love a keyboard shortcut but\n\n350\n00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.120\nthat doesn't mean you have\nto love a keyboard shortcut.\n\n351\n00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.709\nI will always make sure to tell you\nall the different, or at least,\n\n352\n00:16:55.709 --> 00:16:56.827\nmost of the different ways.\n\n353\n00:16:56.827 --> 00:17:01.060\nCuz there's usually about four to five\nto ten different ways to do something.\n\n354\n00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:05.950\nSo I tried to cover them, but I do have\nsome links to do some basic shortcuts for\n\n355\n00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:10.090\nbeing an Apple user all together and\nthen specifically for PowerPoint for\n\n356\n00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:11.870\nMac that you could go ahead and use.\n\n357\n00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:14.680\nIf at any time throughout this series,\nif you're watching in a sequence,\n\n358\n00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:21.810\nif I start saying Ctrl+X or Ctrl+C,\nit really is Cmd, it's just sometimes for\n\n359\n00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:24.435\nme I have to remember where am I-\n&gt;&gt; Mac.\n\n360\n00:17:24.435 --> 00:17:26.260\n&gt;&gt; Mac, Cmd.\n\n361\n00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.540\nSo that basic Cut, Copy, and Paste.\n\n362\n00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.390\nEverything adds a very important\nfunctionality that you can do\n\n363\n00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.350\nbetween all Office products,\nbetween browsers, between everything.\n\n364\n00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:40.130\nAnd if I'm doing it and\nnot showing you the menu button,\n\n365\n00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.830\nI'm probably using a keyboard shortcut\ncuz they're very much ingrained in me.\n\n366\n00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.470\nBut I just wanted to throw this slide on.\n\n367\n00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.060\nAnd the paste options.\n\n368\n00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.270\nPaste options is awesome.\n\n369\n00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.080\nThose smart tags, you'll be seeing them.\n\n370\n00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.630\nI remember when they first came out,\nI was like, why are you flashing?\n\n371\n00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.880\nGet out of here.\nThey are amazing so\n\n372\n00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.240\nI'll be making sure to emphasizing\nthose particular smart tags and\n\n373\n00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.180\npaste options when we get into\ndoing our cut, copy, and paste.\n\n374\n00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.958\nUndo and redo, your best friends.\n\n375\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.660\nSeriously they are your best friends.\n\n376\n00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.147\nIf you've messed something up oops,\n\n377\n00:18:09.147 --> 00:18:11.073\nI always used to call this the oops button\n&gt;&gt;

Right.\n&gt;&gt; So that's kind of a nice little hey,\n\n507\n00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:25.290\nyou how you doing?\n\n508\n00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:27.665\nAll right, so you can open the file.\n\n509\n00:24:27.665 --> 00:24:31.225\nCouple little things I wanted to go over\nwith the minimize and maximize, and that\n\n510\n00:24:31.225 --> 00:24:36.495\nis that new OS thing that Cr, actually, I\nthink it was in Yosemite I was doing this.\n\n511\n00:24:36.495 --> 00:24:38.695\nIf you click the Maximize button,\n\n512\n00:24:38.695 --> 00:24:41.855\nthe green button,\nit actually goes into full screen mode.\n\n513\n00:24:41.855 --> 00:24:43.605\n&gt;&gt; That gives you a whole desktop, right?\n\n514\n00:24:43.605 --> 00:24:44.233\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah.\nAnd\n\n515\n00:24:44.233 --> 00:24:47.883\nso when it goes to full screen mode all of\nyour menus go away, your doc goes away,\n\n516\n00:24:47.883 --> 00:24:50.613\nand if you're not familiar you're like,\nwhat did I do?\n\n517\n00:24:50.613 --> 00:24:51.649\nLike how do I get out?\n\n518\n00:24:51.649 --> 00:24:52.447\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Three finger swipes.\n\n519\n00:24:52.447 --> 00:24:54.150\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n520\n00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:57.960\nIf you move your mouse up it will go ahead\nand bring your commands back down and\n\n521\n00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:02.100\nso you could see the menu and\nyou could go ahead and now restore down.\n\n522\n00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.780\nSo it is a kind of a different thing,\nthis is more of an operating system thing,\n\n523\n00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.110\nnot necessarily an Office thing.\n\n524\n00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:12.960\nBut if you wanted to change this, you see,\nif you hold you Alt or your Option key,\n\n525\n00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.930\nit actually change sit to go\nback to your older version.\n\n526\n00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.360\nWhere it actually just kind of zooms,\nit makes it bigger,\n\n527\n00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.370\nif I had the window a little bit\nsmaller that would actually show there.\n\n528\n00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:26.500\nSo now it goes ahead and\ndoesn't go into full screen mode, but\n\n529\n00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.870\nit does the maximizing every window.\n\n530\n00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:30.720\n&gt;&gt; The most traditional maximization.\n\n531\n00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.000\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, but you have to remember to\nhold your alt key down on that one so.\n\n532\n00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.110\n&gt;&gt; That's a Mac for you.\n\n533\n00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:36.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n534\n00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:36.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n535\n00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:39.260\nyou can also double if\nyour windows are small,\n\n536\n00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:42.890\nyou can also double click your title bar\nand when you double click the title bar it\n\n537\n00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:47.730\nacts like that old, I call old school, the\nold school way of maximizing your windows.\n\n538\n00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:52.020\nI just wanted to go ahead and\nthrow that out for you.\n\n539\n00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:55.100\nOf course, if you're working with\nmultiple files, if I go to file,\n\n540\n00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.400\nopen your file menu, that is something\nthat is very different from PC.\n\n541\n00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.910\nYou don't have a file menu in PC,\nit's called the backstage view.\n\n542\n00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:06.790\nSo, I've always loved the File menu, so\n\n543\n00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.740\nI kinda like it still being there,\nI like that it has menus, period.\n\n544\n00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz, I just I like that.\n\n545\n00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.280\nSo you could always open\nup a file from this way,\n\n546\n00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.590\nif you're already in a file that's just,\nwhat's the little thing on the side,\n\n547\n00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:24.800\nyou can always come to your menus and\ncome to opening up multiple files.\n\n548\n00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.590\nI'm just picking one, just to go ahead and\n\n549\n00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:31.060\nget to where you have multiple files\nopen and if you are a Mac user,\n\n550\n00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:35.028\nyou are pretty used to having windows\nkind of float around in a sense.\n\n551\n00:26:35.028 --> 00:26:39.400\nMaybe im being presumptuous,\nbut I've always been,\n\n552\n00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.920\nas a Mac user, you always have\nwindows kind of everywhere,\n\n553\n00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.930\nthey're not like attached,\nif you wanna say, like kinda PC Windows.\n\n554\n00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:46.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n555\n00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:48.130\n&gt;&gt; That's how I describe it.\n\n556\n00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:51.910\nBut if you didn't need to switch between\nyour windows, you have a Window menu or\n\n557\n00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:56.450\ndifferent files that are open and you can\nsee from here that you could go ahead and\n\n558\n00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:00.470\nlike bring that one to the foreground\nif you're working with multiple files.\n\n559\n00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:06.260\nYeah, if you need to close a file, you\ncan either go to the red X button here.\n\n560\n00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.890\nOr you can go to the File and\nyou can go to Close.\n\n561\n00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:13.400\nOr you have Command+W, which will\nclose the file, not the program.\n\n562\n00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:18.110\nSo if I close animations and\nthen I close here,\n\n563\n00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:21.450\nI'm gonna go ahead and close it from\nthere, you could go ahead and see that,\n\n564\n00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:25.520\nthat's how you can close your windows and\ngo from there.\n\n565\n00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:30.400\nBut PowerPoint is not closed,\nthe program is still open.\n\n566\n00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.530\nYou can see because down on your doc\nyou have a little dot down there\n\n567\n00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:38.210\nthat indicates I am still running,\nI don't have any files open.\n\n568\n00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:42.740\nSo sometimes it makes it look like\nI am not really running but you do.\n\n569\n00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:43.910\nThat is a Mac thing itself.\n\n570\n00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:45.240\n&gt;&gt; That's a Mac thing, yeah.\n\n571\n00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.630\n&gt;&gt; It's just how it works.\n\n572\n00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:52.580\nSo you can always Command Q or go to\nthe Powerpoint menu and from PowerPoint,\n\n573\n00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:57.380\nyou can go ahead and\nquit the whole entire program.\n\n574\n00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:03.720\nThe last thing I'd like to talk about\nwould be save versus save as, right?\n\n575\n00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.190\n&gt;&gt; The immortal question, right?\n\n576\n00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n577\n00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:09.460\n&gt;&gt; What is the difference between\nthe save and the save as?\n\n578\n00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.070\nAnd as soon as you tell\nthe good people what that is.\n\n579\n00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:16.455\nIf you're unfamiliar what\nthe difference is, you're gonna go.\n\n580\n00:28:16.455 --> 00:28:18.370\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That makes total sense now.\n\n581\n00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:19.299\nYvonne I'll leave it to you.\n\n582\n00:28:19.299 --> 00:28:20.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well thank you,\n\n583\n00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:23.310\nso I went ahead and opened up a file.\n\n584\n00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:26.590\nI did that while he was talking\njust to kind of get us along.\n\n585\n00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:29.720\nSo I have here,\nif I start making changes, and\n\n586\n00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.680\nwe will go over how do I actually insert\ntext and everything to that effect.\n\n587\n00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:38.680\nIf I go ahead and say learn PowerPoint\ntoday and I've made a change.\n\n588\n00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.340\nIf I do a file save right now,\n\n589\n00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:45.200\nI am committing the changes to\nthis file that hasn't already.\n\n590\n00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.540\nIt has a name, and it has a home.\n\n591\n00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:51.930\nAnd I'm saying this is where I want\nto make my changes to this file.\n\n592\n00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:53.190\nBut Like I was saying,\n\n593\n00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:58.500\nI wanna be able to give Learn PowerPoint\nto you without the word today in it.\n\n594\n00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.870\nSo I need to make sure\nthat I'm making a copy,\n\n595\n00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:07.015\nfile save as will go ahead and\nit gives you.\n\n596\n00:29:07.015 --> 00:29:08.258\nIt gives you the opportunity-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n597\n00:29:08.258 --> 00:29:10.170\n&gt;&gt; To give it a new name and a new home.\n\n598\n00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.750\nAnd sometimes a new type,\nif you ever wanted to.\n\n599\n00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:18.630\nSo I want it to have this version of\nLearn PowerPoint TODAY be one file and\n\n600\n00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:22.100\nLearn PowerPoint Without the word\ntoday in it would be a separate file.\n\n601\n00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:25.010\nSo that's where you do the File, Save As.\n\n602\n00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:29.030\nAnd then I can name this\nPower Point Today, and\n\n603\n00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.710\nI can put it in a different\nlocation if I wanted to.\n\n604\n00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:32.710\nI'm gonna just go ahead and\n\n605\n00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:38.320\nkeep it right here in my folder that\nI'm using to have all of my files.\n\n606\n00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.410\nSo you could see,\nIf I come back to my finder is that,\n\n607\n00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:44.800\nlearn PowerPoint without Word today.\n\n608\n00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.650\nLearn PowerPoint today, today.\n\n609\n00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:48.540\nThat's what I'm gonna give to you, and\n\n610\n00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:51.020\nthen have to learn PowerPoint I\nwould give to you.\n\n611\n00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:54.490\n&gt;&gt; So save,\noverrides the original file, save\n\n612\n00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:59.410\nas creates a copy of the new file with any\nchanges that you've made in that as well.\n\n613\n00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:01.540\nSo pretty simple, pretty straightforward.\n\n614\n00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:05.710\nNow that you guys know that, you can\nuse save and save as all willy nilly.\n\n615\n00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:10.630\nYou can just go crazy and you can feel a\nlittle smarter than a lot of other people.\n\n616\n00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:12.060\nFor some people it's very confusing.\n\n617\n00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.900\nIt's confusing to a lot of people.\n\n618\n00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.080\nWhat's the difference?\n\n619\n00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.650\nNow you know and\nyou can utilize it correctly, and\n\n620\n00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.950\nit is actually very helpful.\n\n621\n00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:19.750\n&gt;&gt; Start from the beginning.\n\n622\n00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:20.560\nThat's what I always say.\n\n623\n00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.980\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Yvonne,\nthis has been a fantastic introduction to\n\n624\n00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:26.480\nPowerPoint 2016 for\nour Mac users out there.\n\n625\n00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.590\nHopefully they've enjoyed it,\nI know I sure have.\n\n626\n00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:29.880\nWe do thank you for joining us today.\n\n627\n00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.210\nWe thank our good viewers for\nwatching as well.\n\n628\n00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:34.950\nBut it does look like it is that time for\nus to sign off.\n\n629\n00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:37.200\nFor IT PRO TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie\n\n630\n00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:37.850\n&gt;&gt;

are doing inside a Powerpoint\nbecause the very first think we need to\n\n12\n00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.630\nkind of get familiar with is\nthe actual names of the pieces and\n\n13\n00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.110\nthe places that live within PowerPoint.\n\n14\n00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.770\nNow I'm going to give\nyou the real names and\n\n15\n00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.430\nprobably some time throughout\nthe episodes I will probably call them\n\n16\n00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.460\nlike these-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.320\n&gt;&gt; or what should I call it.\n\n18\n00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.260\nSome things like that.\n\n19\n00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.210\nThat little button that\nlooks like little lines.\n\n20\n00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.480\n&gt;&gt; Very technical.\n\n21\n00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.580\n&gt;&gt; So\nI will give you the technical names now.\n\n22\n00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.524\nBut just know that I tend\nto start making words up.\n\n23\n00:01:04.524 --> 00:01:08.330\n[LAUGH] It won't go away.\n&gt;&gt; Vonne said that was the watchamagig.\n\n24\n00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Whenever I see the four lines of\n\n25\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.110\na triangle button?\n\n26\n00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.950\nIt really is the panel options button.\n\n27\n00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.170\nBut it looks like four\nlines in a triangle.\n\n28\n00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.990\n&gt;&gt; So that's what the button looks like.\n\n29\n00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.280\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; So that's what I call it.\n\n30\n00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.892\n&gt;&gt; That's very descriptive.\n\n31\n00:01:19.892 --> 00:01:20.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I try to, I try to.\n\n32\n00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm going to hopefully\n\n33\n00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.610\nbe very descriptive for\nyou to tell you where we're at.\n\n34\n00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.664\nSo let's jump into a File.\n\n35\n00:01:28.664 --> 00:01:30.640\nFirst I have to get PowerPoint started.\n\n36\n00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.980\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ngo to my launch pad and\n\n37\n00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.450\nI'm going to start my\nMicrosoft PowerPoint 2016.\n\n38\n00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.510\nSo it's a my start screen and\nI do have a file that I want to open.\n\n39\n00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.430\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n40\n00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.630\ntake the left navigation pane over here to\ngo to open and I do have a file on my MAC.\n\n41\n00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.500\nAnd it's going to bring me\nout to where am I going.\n\n42\n00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.820\nI'm already in the folder\nthat I was in before.\n\n43\n00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.090\nSo that's why it took me right to it here.\n\n44\n00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.370\nIt didn't just know that automatically,\nit remembered.\n\n45\n00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.240\nSo I'm gonna go with,\nwhat file we're doing?\n\n46\n00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.780\nWe're going to Learn PowerPoint.\n\n47\n00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.930\nThat is the PowerPoint PPT.\n\n48\n00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.450\nBut for this example,\nit won't be that big of a deal.\n\n49\n00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.090\nBut I did want to show you that.\n\n50\n00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.650\nI opened up the PPT file, not the PPTX\nfile which would be the one that is for\n\n51\n00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.062\nthe most recent version of PowerPoint.\n\n52\n00:02:20.062 --> 00:02:22.810\nIt's actually since 2004, 2003.\n\n53\n00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.110\nSo, it's been around for a while but.\n\n54\n00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.000\nFor this episode,\nwe'll be all right with whatever version.\n\n55\n00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000\nBecause right now, we're not really going\nto be doing much within the file itself.\n\n56\n00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.970\nWe're just getting familiar\nwith our environment.\n\n57\n00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.200\nSo, what is the ribbon, what is the status\nbar, what is the quick access toolbar, and\n\n58\n00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.970\nwhere are our menus?\n\n59\n00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.530\nSo why don't we start with the ribbon.\n\n60\n00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.560\nThe ribbon is across the top,\nright in this section, and\n\n61\n00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.800\nalong the ribbon you have\ntabs such as the insert tab,\n\n62\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.530\nthe design tab, the transitions tab,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n63\n00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.490\nIf you want to access a tab on the ribbon,\n\n64\n00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.695\nyou need to make sure you do a single\nclick, do not double click, single click.\n\n65\n00:03:03.695 --> 00:03:04.421\nit's important.\n\n66\n00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:07.535\nIf I single click on the Design tab you\nwill see that it brings me to the all\n\n67\n00:03:07.535 --> 00:03:10.265\nthe different places where\nI can find design things.\n\n68\n00:03:10.265 --> 00:03:12.635\nIf I go to the Animations\ntab on the ribbon,\n\n69\n00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:17.045\nit's going to take me to where I can do\nsome animations, and so on and so forth.\n\n70\n00:03:17.045 --> 00:03:21.077\nBut if you have, reason why I said single\nclick and not double click is because if I\n\n71\n00:03:21.077 --> 00:03:24.841\nwere on over here and double clicked\non design, watch whats gonna happen.\n\n72\n00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:30.000\nIf I double click on it, what I've done\nis I quickly went to the ribbon and\n\n73\n00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.920\nthen immediately collapsed it.\n\n74\n00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.540\nWhich is something that happens, I think\nwe're just kind of engrained sometimes\n\n75\n00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.160\nto do double clicking on a lot\nof things like to execute.\n\n76\n00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.410\nMaybe in MAC, I think MAC users are kind\nof used to doing a single click,\n\n77\n00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.390\nbut I know coming from Windows\nit's always double click\n\n78\n00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.830\neverything to make something happen.\n\n79\n00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.590\nSo don't do that.\n\n80\n00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.040\nBut if you do, it's okay because then\nhow do I get back to where I can\n\n81\n00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.700\nsee my ribbon options or\noptions in that ribbon tab?\n\n82\n00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.026\nIf you single click it again,\nthen it brings it back up.\n\n83\n00:04:00.026 --> 00:04:03.220\nSo, single click to get to it.\n\n84\n00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.237\nIf you single click it one more time,\nit collapses it.\n\n85\n00:04:06.237 --> 00:04:09.460\nSingle click it one more time,\nit comes on back.\n\n86\n00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.600\nOkay, so just those little nuances\nthat will trip you up if you're like,\n\n87\n00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.920\nI don't know what I just did.\n\n88\n00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.220\n&gt;&gt; So, like, double clicking's more like\na secondary option for clicking on it.\n\n89\n00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.640\n&gt;&gt; It's more like you just\ndid two things at once.\n\n90\n00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.280\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n91\n00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.630\n&gt;&gt; You activated then you collapsed.\n\n92\n00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.949\n&gt;&gt; So why does this keep disappearing,\nit's because you're double clicking and\n\n93\n00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.110\nnot single clicking.\n\n94\n00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.880\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes.\n\n95\n00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.050\n&gt;&gt; Where was Yvonne?\n\n96\n00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.645\nRevive him.\n\n97\n00:04:29.645 --> 00:04:30.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, good.\n\n98\n00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.530\nAnd the other thing to point out\nthat whole collapse saying and\n\n99\n00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.710\nexpanding out the options on your ribbon.\n\n100\n00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.660\nThere is a button all the way over here on\nthe right-hand side past the Share button\n\n101\n00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.560\nthat will tell you it collapsed.\n\n102\n00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.690\nOr we have our nice little tool tips\nthat happened there to be able to say,\n\n103\n00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.240\nthis is where you could collapse or\n\n104\n00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.630\nexpand your ribbon to be able\nto see all of the options on it.\n\n105\n00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.180\nAnd there is a Share button.\n\n106\n00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.370\nI'm putting this as part\nof the ribbon because it's\n\n107\n00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.290\nKinda feels like it's part of the ribbon.\n\n108\n00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.080\nThe sharing of this presentation is when,\nand we get into,\n\n109\n00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.500\nwell, sharing the presentation with others\nbut we could go ahead and share it up into\n\n110\n00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.430\none drive and to be able to collaborate\nwith each other or just send a copy.\n\n111\n00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.940\nI wanna go ahead and send a link to Daniel\nthat will allow him to see See the file,\n\n112\n00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.340\nthat's where the share\ncapabilities come into play.\n\n113\n00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.310\nAnd you can see that there are some\noptions there, But that is for a whole,\n\n114\n00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.760\nprobably the home of the show.\n\n115\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.610\n&gt;&gt; The home of the show.\n\n116\n00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.951\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n&gt;&gt; Step 1 option.\n\n117\n00:05:24.951 --> 00:05:25.688\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n118\n00:05:25.688 --> 00:05:28.240\nI at least wanted to show you like\nwhat does that share button do.\n\n119\n00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.680\nWell it shares.\n\n120\n00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.220\n&gt;&gt; It shares.\n\n121\n00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.200\n&gt;&gt; We're circulating again aren't we?\n\n122\n00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.900\n&gt;&gt; That's right that's what we\nlearned in kindergarten right?\n\n123\n00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.210\nShare with your friends.\n\n124\n00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.410\n&gt;&gt; Yes definitely [LAUGH] So\n\n125\n00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.600\nthose are the ribbon and then\nthe different buttons along the ribbon.\n\n126\n00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.650\nThere is something that I personally.\n\n127\n00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.530\nLike to have shown on my ribbons and\n\n128\n00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.430\nthey're called the group names\nbecause in the Home tab.\n\n129\n00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.140\nSo the Home tab would be a lot of the\nthings that you would think about as like\n\n130\n00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.960\na central part of using PowerPoint,\nthat's why I would say they call it Home.\n\n131\n00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.990\nThings like adding new slides, formatting\nyour text, inserting pictures and shapes,\n\n132\n00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.760\nyou could go ahead and\nhave all of that here.\n\n133\n00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.480\nBut there are specific groups, you can\neven see the little lines right here,\n\n134\n00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.540\nand there's a line right here.\n\n135\n00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.030\nThere's a line between\nthe different pieces or\n\n136\n00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.030\ngroups of things that you can do or\ncommand.\n\n137\n00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.450\nYou can find those groups names if you\ngo into your PowerPoint preferences.\n\n138\n00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.150\nAnd how do you do that?\n\n139\n00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.850\nYou go to your PowerPoint menu and\nthis is where the menus are.\n\n140\n00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.210\nBut we have our Powerpoint preferences.\n\n141\n00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.470\nAll right, so\n\n142\n00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.990\nwe're in here and I would think that it's\non the ribbon until about but it's not.\n\n143\n00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.450\nIt's in the view, and that always\nthrows me off just so you know,\n\n144\n00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.010\nI'm like wait is it the, which one is it?\n\n145\n00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.720\nIt's the view, I need to see\nthe group titles in my ribbon.\n\n146\n00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.870\nSo that's why it's a little confusing.\n\n147\n00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.650\nWhich but you can really just go in and\nlook at and see which one it is.\n\n148\n00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.350\nSo if I go to show group titles,\nthat's the one I'm looking for.\n\n149\n00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.050\nAnd if I say close our preferences.\n\n150\n00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.220\nYou can see right up here Slides,\nFont, Paragraph.\n\n151\n00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.800\nThose are the group names\nwithin these commands.\n\n152\n00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.550\nAnd sometimes,\nif you're looking at help files,\n\n153\n00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.310\nthey might even refer to\nthat like in the group name.\n\n154\n00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.630\nSo if you don't see them,\nyou're kind of like I don't see font.\n\n155\n00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ncuz if it were me I'd be like group names?\n\n156\n00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.010\nI don't see anything that says anything\nabout groups or names of groups.\n\n157\n00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.210\nBut, now that I know what a group name is,\nit's a little easier to find.\n\n158\n00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and for me coming over from\nPowerPoint on a PC, they're always there.\n\n159\n00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.640\nAnd so I'm used to seeing them.\n\n160\n00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.260\nSo that's just something that\nI personally like to see and\n\n161\n00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.450\nthat's why I wanted to show you and share.\n\n162\n00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.880\nSo, why are my options grayed out\nspecifically on this home tab.\n\n163\n00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.200\nLike, I have, these buttons are,\nthey're like on, if you want to say, and\n\n164\n00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.470\nthese seem like they're off.\n\n165\n00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:47.620\nIt's because we're not selected on any\nitems within our slides that will allow us\n\n166\n00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.590\nto start formatting Fonts or paragraphs.\n\n167\n00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.770\nYou would need to actually\nclick on something.\n\n168\n00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.614\nWe have our old-\n&gt;&gt; I believe that Microsoft uses\n\n169\n00:07:54.614 --> 00:07:57.090\nthe terminology of activation, or active.\n\n170\n00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.395\n&gt;&gt; Activation, okay.\n\n171\n00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:01.290\nThat's, well, the way that we used to\nsay it, the way that I always say it,\n\n172\n00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:02.487\nremember, select to effect?\n\n173\n00:08:02.487 --> 00:08:03.937\n&gt;&gt; Select to effect.\n\n174\n00:08:03.937 --> 00:08:04.781\nI like that, yeah.\n\n175\n00:08:04.781 --> 00:08:05.569\n&gt;&gt; Remember our little rules?\n\n176\n00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:06.773\nYes, we had-\n&gt;&gt; I never actually did this before.\n\n177\n00:08:06.773 --> 00:08:10.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Our basic rules of computing\n\n178\n00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.960\nwere select to effect.\n\n179\n00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.140\nYou have to have something selected\nbefore you can make any type of effects.\n\n180\n00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.080\nThe other one was hover,\nI'm already getting to it.\n\n181\n00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.130\n&gt;&gt; The other, you're British now.\n\n182\n00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.520\n&gt;&gt; Other was hover.\n\n183\n00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.355\n&gt;&gt; The other was British, right?\n\n184\n00:08:24.355 --> 00:08:28.067\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As I just completely butcher that.\n\n185\n00:08:28.067 --> 00:08:31.755\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, if they hover to discover is\n\n186\n00:08:31.755 --> 00:08:36.119\nwhere, if I hovered over\nsomething in my environment.\n\n187\n00:08:36.119 --> 00:08:39.696\nIt's going to give me a little tool\ntip that's going to allow me to see,\n\n188\n00:08:39.696 --> 00:08:42.274\nwell, this is shapes, and\nthis is draw a text box.\n\n189\n00:08:42.274 --> 00:08:46.199\nSo it gives you kind of a nice\nlittle hint of what's going on.\n\n190\n00:08:46.199 --> 00:08:50.622\nThe third rule in our basic computing\nwas when in doubt right click\n\n191\n00:08:50.622 --> 00:08:52.157\nwhich didn't rhyme.\n\n192\n00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:55.560\nIt's not as cute as hover to discover.\n\n193\n00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.039\nBut the reason why you right click\nis it's a non executable click,\n\n194\n00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.510\nit gives you options.\n\n195\n00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.210\nSo I don't know what's going on.\n\n196\n00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.430\nHey, let's see if I can right click and\nsee what it can do.\n\n197\n00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:10.010\nAnd it gives you a lot of options,\nso that's our three basic rules.\n\n198\n00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Of computing.\n\n199\n00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.238\nSo coming back to here\nwhy was it grayed out?\n\n200\n00:09:13.238 --> 00:09:15.103\nThat's where we went off\non that little tangent.\n\n201\n00:09:15.103 --> 00:09:15.668\n&gt;&gt; Full circle.\n\n202\n00:09:15.668 --> 00:09:18.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, exactly, exactly.\n\n203\n00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.610\nSo these are the different things\nthat we have on the ribbon.\n\n204\n00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.570\nThere are going to be things\nthat come up along the way.\n\n205\n00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.400\nWhen we get in to actually activating or\nselecting items within our slide.\n\n206\n00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.570\nWhere they are going to be called\ncontextual tabs on the ribbon.\n\n207\n00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:35.310\nContextual tabs means that they're only\ngoing to display when you are selected on\n\n208\n00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.929\nsomething that needs\nto have other options.\n\n209\n00:09:37.929 --> 00:09:42.453\nSuch as clicking on a chart or clicking\non a picture or smart art objects.\n\n210\n00:09:42.453 --> 00:09:47.580\nAnd then you're going to see other\nsee other tabs come up along the way.\n\n211\n00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.410\nSo the ribbon,\npretty much where everything you need to\n\n212\n00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:54.250\ndo is in PowerPoint is\nright on that ribbon.\n\n213\n00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.220\nBut we do have menus.\n\n214\n00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.565\nSo a lot of the things that you can do\non the ribbon are also in the menu,\n\n215\n00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:01.970\nlike insert a picture, insert a chart.\n\n216\n00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.430\nWell, you have an Insert menu.\n\n217\n00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:07.020\nIf you wanted to format your fonts or\nformat your paragraphs,\n\n218\n00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.830\nyou have a Format menu.\n\n219\n00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:12.033\nIf you wanted to run a slideshow,\nyou have a Slideshow menu.\n\n220\n00:10:12.033 --> 00:10:14.111\nSo, you can go to either one of them.\n\n221\n00:10:14.111 --> 00:10:16.909\nThey're pretty much almost the same.\n\n222\n00:10:16.909 --> 00:10:21.423\nIt's the same but different,\nmy favorite saying in the world.\n\n223\n00:10:21.423 --> 00:10:24.979\nBut you can mostly find everything\nyou need in the ribbon.\n\n224\n00:10:24.979 --> 00:10:27.829\nBut there are a few things in the Format.\n\n225\n00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:31.500\nLike if you go to Format Font, you're\ngoing to have a few other options in that\n\n226\n00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.373\ndialogue box that's going to come up.\n\n227\n00:10:33.373 --> 00:10:35.830\nThan with just using the ribbon.\n\n228\n00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:41.180\nSo there's a couple times where it might\ngive you more than what you needed.\n\n229\n00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.090\nAnd of course,\nwe have our all-important File menu,\n\n230\n00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:47.000\nwhich I love, and then we can do\nall of our regular File commands.\n\n231\n00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.340\nWhen that went away in Microsoft,\nit was weird to go to,\n\n232\n00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.870\nwhat was it, Office Button Save?\n\n233\n00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.993\nThat doesn't sound right.\n\n234\n00:10:52.993 --> 00:10:54.106\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what is happening here?\n\n235\n00:10:54.106 --> 00:10:55.610\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a file.\n\n236\n00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:59.501\nFile Save, it's just the command, and\nhaving to go backstage, you would save it.\n\n237\n00:10:59.501 --> 00:11:02.510\nIt's just, as an instructor,\nit always threw me off.\n\n238\n00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:06.344\nIt was like very hard to train\nmyself to stop saying file, save.\n\n239\n00:11:06.344 --> 00:11:07.857\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; File, new.\n\n240\n00:11:07.857 --> 00:11:08.615\nFile, open.\n\n241\n00:11:08.615 --> 00:11:09.865\nSo luckily,\nI don't have to do that [CROSSTALK]\n\n242\n00:11:09.865 --> 00:11:11.576\n&gt;&gt; They did a study on geese about that,\n\n243\n00:11:11.576 --> 00:11:12.135\nactually.\n\n244\n00:11:12.135 --> 00:11:13.547\nRandom aside, random aside.\n\n245\n00:11:13.547 --> 00:11:15.237\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n246\n00:11:15.237 --> 00:11:15.870\n&gt;&gt; Geese?\n\n247\n00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\ntheir egg would roll out of the nest.\n\n248\n00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.910\nAnd their instinct was to reach out and\npull back in with their neck.\n\n249\n00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:24.865\nAnd even if you didn't remove the egg,\nthey would still do it.\n\n250\n00:11:24.865 --> 00:11:26.950\nThey couldn't stop themselves.\n\n251\n00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:30.330\n&gt;&gt; So it was ingrained into them, so\nit's like once something becomes a habit,\n\n252\n00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.840\nit's really hard to make it stop.\n\n253\n00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.020\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well then I'm a goose.\n\n254\n00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:33.604\n&gt;&gt; There you go, you're a goose.\n\n255\n00:11:33.604 --> 00:11:35.824\n&gt;&gt; For sure,\n[LAUGH] I am definitely a goose, yes.\n\n256\n00:11:35.824 --> 00:11:37.690\nWell, that's fascinating.\n\n257\n00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:38.892\nThank you, Daniel.\nI'm happy you're here today.\n\n258\n00:11:38.892 --> 00:11:39.927\n&gt;&gt; Full of all sorts of useless knowledge.\n\n259\n00:11:39.927 --> 00:11:43.230\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well\n\n260\n00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:47.040\nwe continue on some good knowledge about\nPowerPoint with the quick access toolbar.\n\n261\n00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.420\nThat's another area within our PowerPoint\nenvironment that we should go over.\n\n262\n00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.660\nIt's above the ribbon.\n\n263\n00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.210\nAnd it's these little\nbuttons along the top.\n\n264\n00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:58.280\nRemember the little disc button, if you're\nused to seeing that on the toolbar.\n\n265\n00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.870\nWhich I think Mike says it's funny, we saw\nthe disk but I can't remember the last\n\n266\n00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.164\ntime we've used the three and a half,\n&gt;&gt; That is funny,\n\n267\n00:12:04.164 --> 00:12:09.810\nIt's probably just become one of\nthose universal symbols for save.\n\n268\n00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.340\nBecause it's just been around for so long.\n\n269\n00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.675\n&gt;&gt; I know but when was the last time\nyou used a three and a half hard disk?\n\n270\n00:12:14.675 --> 00:12:17.238\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Long time.\n\n271\n00:12:17.238 --> 00:12:18.129\nLong time.\n\n272\n00:12:18.129 --> 00:12:21.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, but like you're\nsaying, that's just what we know to go to.\n\n273\n00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.188\nGo to the disk button and\nyou can do those quick commands.\n\n274\n00:12:24.188 --> 00:12:27.118\nLike I just wanna commit the save so\njust go ahead and click on that button.\n\n275\n00:12:27.118 --> 00:12:30.540\nOr undo and redo buttons,\nour best friends, those are there too.\n\n276\n00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.060\nBut this is where it would be\nnice if you could add other\n\n277\n00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.630\noptions to this Quick Access Toolbar\ncuz think about Quick Access.\n\n278\n00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:44.691\nIf I was going to be on the slide show tab\nwithin my ribbon, I have these options.\n\n279\n00:12:44.691 --> 00:12:47.156\nBut what if I wanted to go ahead and\n\n280\n00:12:47.156 --> 00:12:51.480\nquickly get to formatting my font or\ninserting a picture?\n\n281\n00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.780\nI would have to go over to the Insert\ntab and then go to Picture.\n\n282\n00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.170\nWell, I could add it on\nthe Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n283\n00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.984\nSo that means it doesn't matter what\nribbon or what tab I'm on in the ribbon,\n\n284\n00:13:00.984 --> 00:13:02.286\nI have that Quick Access.\n\n285\n00:13:02.286 --> 00:13:05.200\nIt's always going to stay\nthere no matter where I'm at.\n\n286\n00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.120\nSo you could always go and\ncustomize your Quick Access Toolbar by\n\n287\n00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.990\nclicking on that little line and\ntriangle button.\n\n288\n00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.180\n&gt;&gt; So it's kind like the Doc for\nPowerPoint?\n\n289\n00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.580\nSo you get your dock at\nthe bottom of screen for\n\n290\n00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.680\nMac, put all your favorite things\ndown there so you quickly get to it.\n\n291\n00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.900\nHere, it's just up in the Ribbon.\n\n292\n00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you can remove the things\nthat you don't wanna access a lot.\n\n293\n00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.560\nLike maybe I never use my Notes.\n\n294\n00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.640\nI use it all the time.\n\n295\n00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.060\nBut maybe I didn't use that.\n\n296\n00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.372\nYou can always take that off and\nsay you could go on and click.\n\n297\n00:13:29.372 --> 00:13:32.234\nYou can customize your\nQuick Access Toolbar.\n\n298\n00:13:32.234 --> 00:13:36.116\nYou see, there has a couple of\nthe more commonly used command.\n\n299\n00:13:36.116 --> 00:13:38.528\nThat if you wanted more,\nyou can go to More Commands.\n\n300\n00:13:38.528 --> 00:13:42.569\nWhich actually takes you into your\npreferences for the ribbon and toolbar.\n\n301\n00:13:42.569 --> 00:13:45.490\nAnd you could customize,\nso look out come home.\n\n302\n00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:50.417\nl mean every single tab that is in the\nribbon, every single command is in here.\n\n303\n00:13:50.417 --> 00:13:53.316\nAnd you could go ahead and\nfill up that Quick Access Toolbar and\n\n304\n00:13:53.316 --> 00:13:54.840\nhave everything that you need.\n\n305\n00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.408\nYou can see that they are some ones that\nwouldn't need to pick from which tab on\n\n306\n00:13:59.408 --> 00:14:02.110\nthe ribbon that it comes from.\n\n307\n00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.650\nIf you don't know,\nthey do have the all commands,\n\n308\n00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.790\nthis is an advertise list of everything or\nthing there.\n\n309\n00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:10.975\nBut you can see that there are some\nother tabs that we haven't seen yet.\n\n310\n00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:14.060\nAnd those were those contextual task\nthat I was talking to you about\n\n311\n00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.650\nin the ribbon that we will be showing\nwhen we start clicking on things.\n\n312\n00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.977\nSo, we have our Quick Access Toolbar and\n\n313\n00:14:20.977 --> 00:14:24.490\nI'm going to cancel out and\nclose my PowerPoint Preferences.\n\n314\n00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.773\nThe next thing that we want to explore\nin our environment is going to be\n\n315\n00:14:27.773 --> 00:14:29.315\nthe Status Bar.\n\n316\n00:14:29.315 --> 00:14:30.955\nStatus bar is along the bottom.\n\n317\n00:14:30.955 --> 00:14:32.345\n&gt;&gt; Tells you how many hit\npoints you have left.\n\n318\n00:14:32.345 --> 00:14:32.848\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n319\n00:14:32.848 --> 00:14:34.222\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; And you role playing games.\n[LAUGH]\n\n320\n00:14:34.222 --> 00:14:34.895\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n321\n00:14:34.895 --> 00:14:36.125\nIt gives you the status.\n\n322\n00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:38.035\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Of how many slides do I have.\n\n323\n00:14:38.035 --> 00:14:39.865\nI am right now on slide one of ten.\n\n324\n00:14:39.865 --> 00:14:43.975\nSo I can look quickly right here and know\nmany slides I have cuz maybe I had 65.\n\n325\n00:14:43.975 --> 00:14:47.540\nYou're not gonna see them all\nover here in the slide pane view.\n\n326\n00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.990\nYou could go ahead and see it down here.\n\n327\n00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.650\nIf we keep on going across,\nwe have our notes.\n\n328\n00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:56.160\nThe speaker notes are the part that\nyou're seeing down here at the bottom,\n\n329\n00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:01.390\nthat would be, well, notes for you as a\nspeaker, that you want to be able to have.\n\n330\n00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.530\nMaybe printed them out over\nhere on the side and so\n\n331\n00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.780\nyou can follow along\nwith your presentation.\n\n332\n00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.870\nAnd add notes that you wouldn't want\npeople to see on the slides when you're\n\n333\n00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.980\npresenting, but they are for you.\n\n334\n00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.070\nSo that's why they call them,\nspeaker notes.\n\n335\n00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:16.460\nBut if you don't see that\nlittle intersection down there,\n\n336\n00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.580\nyou can see that if you click it.\n\n337\n00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.950\nThen the notes collapse,\nyou click it again, and the notes come on.\n\n338\n00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.810\nIt's kinda like a show hide for\nyour speaker notes.\n\n339\n00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:25.940\nThe same with comments.\n\n340\n00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.380\nIf you're going to be commenting\nup your presentation to send\n\n341\n00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.810\nto somebody else cuz maybe\nyou're collaborating together.\n\n342\n00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.958\nIt's almost like sticky notes,\nit almost looks like a sticky note there.\n\n343\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.410\nAt least to me it looks\nlike a sticky note.\n\n344\n00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.370\nAnd so you can see that it brings\nup the comment tasks pane.\n\n345\n00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.100\nAnd if I click comments again,\n\n346\n00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.810\nthen it goes ahead and\nhides the comment task pane.\n\n347\n00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.790\nThe other buttons across the bottom,\nthese are your different views.\n\n348\n00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.573\nBecause right now we\nare in the normal view.\n\n349\n00:15:50.573 --> 00:15:52.928\nIf I click on the slide sorter view,\n\n350\n00:15:52.928 --> 00:15:58.045\nthen it gets to where all of my slides are\nin like a grid system if you wanna say.\n\n351\n00:15:58.045 --> 00:16:01.269\nAnd so, it's an easier way for\nme to see all of my slides.\n\n352\n00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:02.084\nAt one time.\n\n353\n00:16:02.084 --> 00:16:05.584\nI'm not gonna click the next one,\nbut the next one is slideshow.\n\n354\n00:16:05.584 --> 00:16:09.439\nWe're actually going to click that\nto run the entire presentation in\n\n355\n00:16:09.439 --> 00:16:12.770\nthe presentation mode when\nwe're displaying our slides.\n\n356\n00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:16.080\n&gt;&gt; And the icon there is a little podium,\nis that what it's supposed to me?\n\n357\n00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, kinda like when\nyou're speaking or lecturing.\n\n358\n00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so that's why the have that icon.\n\n359\n00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.110\nWe have over here our zooms, so\n\n360\n00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:25.530\nyou can see if I zoom in,\nI'm on a slide sorter view right now, so\n\n361\n00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:30.880\nit's just going to be zooming in and\nout of all of the slides that I have.\n\n362\n00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.780\nIf I go back to the normal view and\n\n363\n00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:37.270\nI'm just gonna click the button there\ndown on that status bar to go to normal.\n\n364\n00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:42.630\nMy zoom then goes ahead and zooms\njust the slide that I'm activated on.\n\n365\n00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.792\nAnd it does have a slider where you\ncan just kind of click, hold and drag.\n\n366\n00:16:45.792 --> 00:16:47.499\nThat's starting to kind of hurt my eyes.\n\n367\n00:16:47.499 --> 00:16:50.791\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But you also have the minus and\n\n368\n00:16:50.791 --> 00:16:52.970\nthe plus for your zoom.\n\n369\n00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:58.150\nYou could click on the numbers right here,\nand then you can get to where you can\n\n370\n00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.630\nspecifically type in a zoom,\nif you so desire.\n\n371\n00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.300\nOr you can choose from\nthe radio buttons there.\n\n372\n00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.890\nI'm going to cancel that out.\n\n373\n00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.610\nAnd the last one,\nhere let me zoom in a little bit.\n\n374\n00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:10.550\nThis one is fit slide to window.\n\n375\n00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.960\nSo if you click on that,\nit will automatically go ahead and\n\n376\n00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:18.310\nfit itself in this area that you see for\nyour slides.\n\n377\n00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:22.500\nAnd that's kind of a nice little\nsegway into now the whole.\n\n378\n00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.670\nWe've kinda gone over\nthe environment of the application,\n\n379\n00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:31.920\nwhich by the way is going to be pretty\nmuch identical to Word, Excel and some\n\n380\n00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.090\nof your other Office products, the Ribbon,\nthe Quick Access tool by the Status bar.\n\n381\n00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:40.350\nBut specifically within PowerPoint,\nyou do have over here in a normal view,\n\n382\n00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.090\nyou have your slide pane.\n\n383\n00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.480\nAnd this will allow you to\nnavigate through your slides.\n\n384\n00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:49.186\nYou can see that each slide is numbered,\n1, 2, 3, 4 and\n\n385\n00:17:49.186 --> 00:17:51.830\nit goes through my different slides.\n\n386\n00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:56.200\nAnd then I could see that if I wanted to\ngo, you see I'm scrolling, slide down,\n\n387\n00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:00.550\nI could go to slide 7 or I could go\nto slide 8, or I could go to slide 9.\n\n388\n00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:03.100\nNow you can see that in\nsome of the numbers,\n\n389\n00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.900\nthere's like a little star underneath it,\nthat star\n\n390\n00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:11.960\nindicates to you that there's some\ntype of animation on this slide.\n\n391\n00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.610\nNow, this could either be\na form of a slide transition or\n\n392\n00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:19.840\nit could be actual animation\nof objects on a slide.\n\n393\n00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.520\nEither one.\n\n394\n00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.110\nIt just depends on what's there.\n\n395\n00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:27.540\nSo it doesn't specify,\nit just says something is\n\n396\n00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:32.105\ngoing to be happening with this\nslide because of that star.\n\n397\n00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:37.450\nThe slide that you're on depends\non what is on that red box.\n\n398\n00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.420\nWhat slide in that slide pen\nhas a red box around it?\n\n399\n00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.350\nThat's the slide you're going\nto be seeing in the slide area.\n\n400\n00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.880\nThis is the slide that\nI'm on that's what I see.\n\n401\n00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.390\nIf I scroll up in my slide pane,\n\n402\n00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:53.320\nsome of them have,\nI see what's going on with slide three?\n\n403\n00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.400\nIt's kinda dimmed down,\nbecause that is a hidden slide.\n\n404\n00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.780\nWhy would I wanna hide a slide?\n\n405\n00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:02.640\nWell, maybe I have slides that are for\none specific audience that I would like to\n\n406\n00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.200\nhave shown, but then maybe I'm giving the\npresentation to another group of people,\n\n407\n00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.140\nthat they don't really\nneed to see slide three.\n\n408\n00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.580\nMaybe it has specific information\nthat they just don't need.\n\n409\n00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.120\nSo you could hide slides\nto kind of control\n\n410\n00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.770\nwhat people are seeing when you\nactually view the presentation.\n\n411\n00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.934\n&gt;&gt; I just thought Fuego and\nBishop there had shamed you in some way.\n\n412\n00:19:21.934 --> 00:19:24.661\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, they do like to try that.\n\n413\n00:19:24.661 --> 00:19:25.312\n&gt;&gt; You were shunning them.\n\n414\n00:19:25.312 --> 00:19:27.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's like, I haven't been fed.\n\n415\n00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.334\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then the it's like,\n\n416\n00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:30.444\nno I've already fed you, don't try that.\n\n417\n00:19:30.444 --> 00:19:31.771\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yes,\n\n418\n00:19:31.771 --> 00:19:34.058\nyou will be seeing a lot of Fuego and\nBishop throughout these-\n\n419\n00:19:34.058 --> 00:19:34.701\n&gt;&gt; We look forward to seeing them.\n\n420\n00:19:34.701 --> 00:19:35.442\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n421\n00:19:35.442 --> 00:19:36.848\nthese are the stars of\nthe PowerPoint shows.\n\n422\n00:19:36.848 --> 00:19:37.644\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n423\n00:19:37.644 --> 00:19:41.079\nwe'll be seeing lots of different\nthings with these little guys.\n\n424\n00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.950\nSo this is how you know which\nslide you're going to be on.\n\n425\n00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:48.000\nYou could go ahead and\nclick on it and activate the slide.\n\n426\n00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.060\nYou can also use your scroll on your\nmouse if you wanted to scroll through\n\n427\n00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.550\nthe different slides that you have.\n\n428\n00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.270\nEach slide has different speaker notes.\n\n429\n00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:01.270\nAs you see if I scroll to,\nlet me go to slide one.\n\n430\n00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:04.390\nAnd I'm going to come\nbetween the slide area and\n\n431\n00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:07.120\nthe speaker notes, and\nyou get a line with two arrows.\n\n432\n00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.330\nThat's where you can expand\nthis area of the speaker notes.\n\n433\n00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.550\nAnd you can see that you could\ntype in anything that you want for\n\n434\n00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.650\nyou to remind yourself of\nthings you need to talk about.\n\n435\n00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.760\nAnd then you use that while\nyou're giving your presentation.\n\n436\n00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.570\nAnd they will change depending\non what slide you're on.\n\n437\n00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:26.730\nBecause every slide is another\nvisual representation of\n\n438\n00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.260\nwhat you're trying to talk about.\n\n439\n00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:33.510\nSo then the speaker notes one slide two\nwill be different than the ones on slide\n\n440\n00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:39.990\nthree, and slide four, and you could\ngo ahead and see all of those there.\n\n441\n00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.835\nWhat about delivering this presentation?\n\n442\n00:20:42.835 --> 00:20:47.160\nI've created this presentation in each\nslide that we have here is going to go\n\n443\n00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.503\nover things that we're going to be\nlearning throughout this whole series.\n\n444\n00:20:51.503 --> 00:20:53.922\nYou could see we're going\nto be putting in pictures,\n\n445\n00:20:53.922 --> 00:20:56.144\nwe're going to be putting in charts and\ntables.\n\n446\n00:20:56.144 --> 00:20:58.292\nMaybe let me make this a little smaller so\nyou can see this.\n\n447\n00:20:58.292 --> 00:21:00.020\nwe're hen we're putting in Smart R,\n\n448\n00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.920\nso all of these different items\non the slide are being used to\n\n449\n00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:09.330\ncreate our overall presentation to\nconvey whatever we want to present.\n\n450\n00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:13.071\nSo I'm ready to go ahead and\ngive the presentation,\n\n451\n00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:17.333\nyou go to the slide show tab and\nyou can go to Play from Start.\n\n452\n00:21:17.333 --> 00:21:20.287\nOr you can always go to the slide\nshow menu and do play from start,\n\n453\n00:21:20.287 --> 00:21:23.877\nwhichever way you want to do it,\nbecause I Well,wanna start the beginning.\n\n454\n00:21:23.877 --> 00:21:29.117\nHere is what the the viewers are going to\nbe seeing, it l had my first slide that we\n\n455\n00:21:29.117 --> 00:21:34.359\ngonna talk about PowerPoint and l am going\nto go a head and use all of the different\n\n456\n00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:39.002\nnotes to introduce the slide show\nthat l am going to present to people.\n\n457\n00:21:39.002 --> 00:21:42.625\nNow for me to go to the next slide,\nyou can just click the mouse and\n\n458\n00:21:42.625 --> 00:21:47.110\nif you just click the mouse,\nit's gonna take you to the next slide.\n\n459\n00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.550\nYou could also hit like the space bar,\nwe'll go over a bunch of\n\n460\n00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:55.080\ndifferent shortcuts and different ways\nthat we could deliver the presentation.\n\n461\n00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.610\nBut for right now we're just\ndoing a quick overview of like,\n\n462\n00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:01.750\nI've created a presentation,\nnow I'm going to run my slide show and\n\n463\n00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.420\nI can go ahead and keep on moving forward.\n\n464\n00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.770\nNow something that's interesting\nthat's happening on my end that\n\n465\n00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:11.430\nyou guys can't see right now, is that\nthe way that we're set up, my computer,\n\n466\n00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:14.610\nmy MAC automatically detects\nthat my computer is one monitor,\n\n467\n00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:17.430\nand what you're seeing\nis a second monitor.\n\n468\n00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.960\nSo what I'm looking at is I'm\nlooking at presenter mode.\n\n469\n00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:25.140\n&gt;&gt; Which is really, really handy if\nyou have a multiple monitor setup,\n\n470\n00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.280\nbecause I can tell that what's\ngonna be the next slide,\n\n471\n00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.440\nI can also see my speaker\nnotes right here.\n\n472\n00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:35.380\nAnd it's giving me a kind of as\na presenter, like a back-end view.\n\n473\n00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:36.310\n&gt;&gt; Behind the scenes.\n\n474\n00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.810\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n475\n00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:37.547\n&gt;&gt; What's coming next.\n\n476\n00:22:37.547 --> 00:22:39.697\nSo what I can do right here that you can't\n\n477\n00:22:39.697 --> 00:22:42.427\nsee me doing is I can switch\ndisplays in the middle.\n\n478\n00:22:42.427 --> 00:22:44.168\nThat's what I'm seeing.\n\n479\n00:22:44.168 --> 00:22:44.702\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n480\n00:22:44.702 --> 00:22:45.860\n&gt;&gt; On my monitor and\n\n481\n00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:51.003\nnow the slide show where the whole\ncomputer is like displaying my slides.\n\n482\n00:22:51.003 --> 00:22:52.450\nThat's what I see on this monitor.\n\n483\n00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.300\nSo that's a nice thing with Macs' is\nthat it automatically detects that.\n\n484\n00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.290\nBut what I had to do is that,\n\n485\n00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:01.610\nhad to make sure to remember which\nmonitor was which when I started.\n\n486\n00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:04.880\nTo make sure that you guys were\nseeing the presentation and\n\n487\n00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.770\nI was seeing the presentator mode,\nthe presentation view.\n\n488\n00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:13.530\n&gt;&gt; So if you're out presenting and\nyou start your slide show and\n\n489\n00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.480\nthis is what everybody else is seeing?\n\n490\n00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.970\n&gt;&gt; Just do a little flippy floppy.\n\n491\n00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And now you're back in action.\n\n492\n00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nit's nice to be able to see that.\n\n493\n00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.220\n&gt;&gt; And I just realize that while I\nneed to go back to the presenter view,\n\n494\n00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.150\nso I need to swap displays.\n\n495\n00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:27.130\nNotice that you can't see this, but\n\n496\n00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:32.220\nif I go to Here there is little\nbuttons that will show up right there.\n\n497\n00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:36.370\nYou can see it right,\nthat's kinda weird to see it from there.\n\n498\n00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:39.030\nThere we go.\n[LAUGH] That button right there is where\n\n499\n00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:41.620\nI can, well this is hard\nto show up those monitors.\n\n500\n00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:45.194\nDid you see those little buttons on\nthe bottom right on the bottom left\n\n501\n00:23:45.194 --> 00:23:46.122\nthe other right.\n\n502\n00:23:46.122 --> 00:23:49.484\nThe one that looks almost like\na little note, the third one in,\n\n503\n00:23:49.484 --> 00:23:53.354\nyou can click that and it will tell\nyou to switch displays, because it's\n\n504\n00:23:53.354 --> 00:23:57.688\ndetecting that I'm in presenter mode\nIt's doing a couple little weird things.\n\n505\n00:23:57.688 --> 00:23:59.292\nIf you only have one monitor,\n\n506\n00:23:59.292 --> 00:24:03.090\nthen that's what you could click on\nto be able to show presenter mode.\n\n507\n00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:06.220\nSo definitely check that\nout as you go through it.\n\n508\n00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.990\nAnd you can see that I can just\nkeep on going through each slide.\n\n509\n00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:13.775\nWe're gonna compare Fuego and Bishop, and\nwe're gonna talk about our charts and\n\n510\n00:24:13.775 --> 00:24:17.795\ntables, and I would then talk about\nhow Bishop likes to sleep a lot and\n\n511\n00:24:17.795 --> 00:24:19.548\nFuego just likes to eat a lot.\n\n512\n00:24:19.548 --> 00:24:20.663\n&gt;&gt; Fuego has an eating disorder.\n\n513\n00:24:20.663 --> 00:24:23.911\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] he's a [INAUDIBLE].\n\n514\n00:24:23.911 --> 00:24:25.389\nHe's a very dense cat.\n\n515\n00:24:25.389 --> 00:24:26.806\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; He is solid.\n\n516\n00:24:26.806 --> 00:24:27.536\n&gt;&gt; I bet he is.\n\n517\n00:24:27.536 --> 00:24:28.928\n&gt;&gt; He's a big boy [LAUGH].\n\n518\n00:24:28.928 --> 00:24:30.014\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n519\n00:24:30.014 --> 00:24:31.887\nwe can talk about our SmartArt, and\n\n520\n00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:36.024\nthen when I came to slide eight this is\nwhere we will have that basic animation.\n\n521\n00:24:36.024 --> 00:24:40.834\nWe are gonna be going over how we control\nwhat topics that I wanna talk about by\n\n522\n00:24:40.834 --> 00:24:43.100\nusing some very simple animation.\n\n523\n00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:47.353\nBecause if you saw some of my other slides\nyou were already reading them as I was\n\n524\n00:24:47.353 --> 00:24:47.951\ntalking.\n\n525\n00:24:47.951 --> 00:24:52.630\nAnd if you want to have them focus on\nyou before we get to that first point,\n\n526\n00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:56.238\nyou can control when the points or\nthe different texts or\n\n527\n00:24:56.238 --> 00:25:00.500\nany object really on your slide\ncomes in so we can talk about this.\n\n528\n00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.236\nAnd then the next one that I\nwanna talk about will come now.\n\n529\n00:25:03.236 --> 00:25:08.196\nThat we can control the pace of our\npresentation until I'm ready to click\n\n530\n00:25:08.196 --> 00:25:12.925\nonto the next topic was just slide\ntransitions, I forgot my points.\n\n531\n00:25:12.925 --> 00:25:14.522\nI'm like, okay there we go.\n\n532\n00:25:14.522 --> 00:25:19.048\nAnd did you see right there, that was\nmy indication, slide transitions, next.\n\n533\n00:25:19.048 --> 00:25:20.515\nAlways practice your\nshow before you do it.\n\n534\n00:25:20.515 --> 00:25:21.212\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's like a fade.\n\n535\n00:25:21.212 --> 00:25:25.904\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And you see that it kind\nof morphed into the next slide,\n\n536\n00:25:25.904 --> 00:25:28.210\nhence, slide transitions.\n\n537\n00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:32.315\nSo it's some different animations that\nyou can add within your presentation.\n\n538\n00:25:32.315 --> 00:25:37.710\nAnd it always ends on that black screen,\nright here to end the slide show.\n\n539\n00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:40.944\nSo that way if you think I am done and\npeople are filing out,\n\n540\n00:25:40.944 --> 00:25:43.594\nyou could have always\nended on that last slide.\n\n541\n00:25:43.594 --> 00:25:46.631\nBut always gets you to that\nblack screen by default and\n\n542\n00:25:46.631 --> 00:25:48.931\nthen it takes me out of everything.\n\n543\n00:25:48.931 --> 00:25:51.260\nHello.\nHi PowerPoint, come on over here.\n\n544\n00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:51.921\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n545\n00:25:51.921 --> 00:25:53.599\n&gt;&gt; I think that second monitor thing kind\n\n546\n00:25:53.599 --> 00:25:55.071\nof threw itself off a little bit.\n\n547\n00:25:55.071 --> 00:25:55.616\nBut that's all right.\n\n548\n00:25:55.616 --> 00:25:58.603\nI can go ahead and\nbring it right on in there, and\n\n549\n00:25:58.603 --> 00:26:00.705\nthat's how I could run the show.\n\n550\n00:26:00.705 --> 00:26:04.321\nThere's one little thing that I\nwould like to show everybody.\n\n551\n00:26:04.321 --> 00:26:07.828\nAnd remember when I said it'll be\nfine if I open up that PPT file,\n\n552\n00:26:07.828 --> 00:26:09.102\nit's gonna be the same?\n\n553\n00:26:09.102 --> 00:26:09.677\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n554\n00:26:09.677 --> 00:26:10.253\n&gt;&gt; It's not.\n\n555\n00:26:10.253 --> 00:26:11.422\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n556\n00:26:11.422 --> 00:26:12.967\n&gt;&gt; Because there's something I wanted\n\n557\n00:26:12.967 --> 00:26:14.850\nto show you about sections.\n\n558\n00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.364\nLet me open a file for you, and\n\n559\n00:26:17.364 --> 00:26:23.307\nwe'll open that PPTX file that's on\nmy Mac and there is, there we go.\n\n560\n00:26:23.307 --> 00:26:24.955\nAlways look at those extensions.\n\n561\n00:26:24.955 --> 00:26:27.197\nWe covered that in the introduction.\n\n562\n00:26:27.197 --> 00:26:30.430\nIf you're not knowing what I'm\ntalking about, definitely check out\n\n563\n00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.718\nthe introduction to PowerPoint\nepisode that's before this or in the,\n\n564\n00:26:33.718 --> 00:26:37.637\nI think maybe just before in the list view\nof the episodes within the course library.\n\n565\n00:26:37.637 --> 00:26:38.397\n&gt;&gt; Probably.\n\n566\n00:26:38.397 --> 00:26:39.335\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n567\n00:26:39.335 --> 00:26:41.527\nThe intro usually comes first, so.\n\n568\n00:26:41.527 --> 00:26:42.462\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like to do that last.\n\n569\n00:26:42.462 --> 00:26:44.358\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you know what I did?\n\n570\n00:26:44.358 --> 00:26:45.472\nI opened up the wrong file again.\n\n571\n00:26:45.472 --> 00:26:46.072\n&gt;&gt; Of course you did.\n\n572\n00:26:46.072 --> 00:26:47.090\nSee, cuz you weren't paying attention.\n\n573\n00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:50.029\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm trying to talk to you and\ndo two things at once.\n\n574\n00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:52.729\nAnd I'm trying to remember,\nthis is the file that I need to do.\n\n575\n00:26:52.729 --> 00:26:57.097\nLearn PowerPoint PPTX, there we go.\n\n576\n00:26:57.097 --> 00:26:59.189\n&gt;&gt; There it is!\n&gt;&gt; This is the one I wanted to show you.\n\n577\n00:26:59.189 --> 00:27:03.415\nSo you see over here in this slide tab,\nor the slide navigation pane.\n\n578\n00:27:03.415 --> 00:27:04.987\nYou have sections and\n\n579\n00:27:04.987 --> 00:27:10.053\nthis is actually maybe a great\ndemonstration of older file format not\n\n580\n00:27:10.053 --> 00:27:15.399\nsupporting some of the new features\nsuch as sections in the PowerPoint.\n\n581\n00:27:15.399 --> 00:27:16.713\nWhy would you use sections?\n\n582\n00:27:16.713 --> 00:27:21.086\nIt's just like why we section off\nanything it's a way of organizing\n\n583\n00:27:21.086 --> 00:27:24.153\nour slides into well sections,\nI don't know or\n\n584\n00:27:24.153 --> 00:27:27.849\nhave any other name to say or\nany other way to describe it.\n\n585\n00:27:27.849 --> 00:27:31.312\nSo I have a start and\nI have these three slides in here and\n\n586\n00:27:31.312 --> 00:27:35.754\nthen we come into images chart and\nSmartArt, and I can just organize my\n\n587\n00:27:35.754 --> 00:27:39.772\npresentation different ways,\nI can also collapse sections.\n\n588\n00:27:39.772 --> 00:27:44.649\nCuz think about if you had 70 slides, and\nyou need to kinda get to specific areas\n\n589\n00:27:44.649 --> 00:27:47.602\nquickly, you can use\nthese ways of collapsing.\n\n590\n00:27:47.602 --> 00:27:50.673\nAnd then you can click on\nthe different sections and\n\n591\n00:27:50.673 --> 00:27:55.325\nexpand them out to get around your slide\nshow presentation a little quicker.\n\n592\n00:27:55.325 --> 00:27:56.267\n&gt;&gt; It's just organizational.\n\n593\n00:27:56.267 --> 00:27:58.413\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I think of it like back when before we\n\n594\n00:27:58.413 --> 00:28:02.214\nhad Coinstar, you had to sit there with\nyour change tray and put pennies in one\n\n595\n00:28:02.214 --> 00:28:03.620\npile and nickels in another\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n596\n00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.890\n&gt;&gt; And then you counted them all and\n\n597\n00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:05.601\nyou add it all up.\n\n598\n00:28:05.601 --> 00:28:07.810\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, things kind of the same idea.\n\n599\n00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:10.897\nHere's all my pennies, here's all my\nnickels, here's all my dimes and so on.\n\n600\n00:28:10.897 --> 00:28:12.080\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, good.\n\n601\n00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.683\nIt's just, for me,\nyou don't have to use sections.\n\n602\n00:28:14.683 --> 00:28:16.310\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But for you, if you wanted to,\n\n603\n00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:17.230\nyou can organize it.\n\n604\n00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:21.739\nAnd if you do use sections when we\nget later into creating custom shows,\n\n605\n00:28:21.739 --> 00:28:23.406\nit'll come back around.\n\n606\n00:28:23.406 --> 00:28:26.610\nAs like that's a good reason of\nwhy I might want to use sections.\n\n607\n00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.591\nBecause I could set up\nour shows differently,\n\n608\n00:28:29.591 --> 00:28:33.190\na custom show of why I want this\nsection to go before that section.\n\n609\n00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.890\nSo it doesn't necessarily have to be\none linear presentation like we did\n\n610\n00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:38.010\nin this example.\n\n611\n00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:39.590\nYou can customize your shows and so\n\n612\n00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:43.450\nsections will come back\naround in that episode.\n\n613\n00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:44.648\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff.\n\n614\n00:28:44.648 --> 00:28:47.735\nWell Vonne, I'm assuming,\nand I think I am right,\n\n615\n00:28:47.735 --> 00:28:51.187\nthat we have walked through\nthe PowerPoint environment.\n\n616\n00:28:51.187 --> 00:28:55.190\nWe've seen a lot of functionality what\nit can do, where those things are.\n\n617\n00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:56.892\nLearned a lot of definitional terms,\nright?\n\n618\n00:28:56.892 --> 00:28:59.030\nThings that, so\nwe can all talk the same language.\n\n619\n00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.908\nSo when Vonne says thingamajig,\nwe all go yes.\n\n620\n00:29:01.908 --> 00:29:03.360\nThat's right, it's the-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n621\n00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.814\n&gt;&gt; Four line triangle, right?\n\n622\n00:29:04.814 -->

00:00:10.590\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.055\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:17.005\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:18.525\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.525 --> 00:00:24.295\nin today's episode we are back with more\nof our Powerpoint 2016 for MAC-series.\n\n8\n00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:26.900\nJoining us in the studio yet\nagain, our good friend and\n\n9\n00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.380\nmentor in this endeavour,\nthat's right, she is Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.530\nVonne, welcome back, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.920\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, it's going great.\n\n12\n00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.560\nWe're going to slide right\nin to creating slides.\n\n13\n00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.580\n&gt;&gt; l see what you did there.\n\n14\n00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you like that one?\n\n15\n00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:39.915\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She's good.\n\n16\n00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:43.170\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yes, the whole cornerstone of making\n\n17\n00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.270\na PowerPoint presentation\nis to create slides.\n\n18\n00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.180\nSo, this is where we're\ngoing to add slides,\n\n19\n00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.740\nwhere we're going to delete slides,\nwe're going to duplicate slides and\n\n20\n00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.720\nwe're going to rearrange slides, all\nthe different things that's we're going to\n\n21\n00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.660\ndo before we start adding content\nwhich will be in the next episode.\n\n22\n00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.070\nSo, let's get Started\nwith adding some slides.\n\n23\n00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.120\nI have PowerPoint ready to go and\nwe're gonna start this file or\n\n24\n00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.100\nthis show with a new file.\n\n25\n00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.780\nSo, we're gonna click on\nthe new button right here.\n\n26\n00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.143\nAnd each image you start a new\npresentation it will ask you if you will\n\n27\n00:01:15.143 --> 00:01:19.160\nall these different, these pretty things\nlike celestial and crop and circuit.\n\n28\n00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.860\nWhat are those?\n\n29\n00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.810\nThose are design themes and so, you can\nstart a new presentation right off the bat\n\n30\n00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.120\nwith a specific theme and\nyou can add slides from there.\n\n31\n00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.200\nWe're gonna start with just\na blank presentation and\n\n32\n00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.760\nwe're gonna concentrate more on\nare themes in some later episodes when\n\n33\n00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.910\nwe start getting things and\nprettified, prettify some things.\n\n34\n00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.310\nI don't think, that's not a word.\n\n35\n00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.888\n&gt;&gt; Beautify is probably the one.\n\n36\n00:01:39.888 --> 00:01:42.208\n&gt;&gt; Beautify, yes,\ngussy it up as my dad would say.\n\n37\n00:01:42.208 --> 00:01:43.448\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, whoa.\n\n38\n00:01:43.448 --> 00:01:44.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's from my dad.\n&gt;&gt; Well done, well done.\n\n39\n00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.400\n&gt;&gt; One of my favorites growing up.\n\n40\n00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.340\n&gt;&gt; That's a good one.\n\n41\n00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.290\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna go ahead and\nstart this blank presentation.\n\n42\n00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.220\nWe're gonna go ahead and click create.\n\n43\n00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.950\nAnd always starts off with a title\n\n44\n00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.310\nslide cuz every slide that we're\ngoing to add in a presentation,\n\n45\n00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.540\nwe also have to consider what our\nlayout of the slide is going to be.\n\n46\n00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.460\nAnd when you start a new presentation,\nthink about where you're starting.\n\n47\n00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.110\nYou have a title, what is the title\nof this presentation and then,\n\n48\n00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.560\nit gives you a subtitle.\n\n49\n00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.490\nThese are a different\nplaceholders that are by default\n\n50\n00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.940\nadded to this particular layout.\n\n51\n00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.150\nIf I wanted to add more\nslides with more layouts,\n\n52\n00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.995\nwell than we have to go to\nTo our New Slide button.\n\n53\n00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:31.585\nI want to add a newsletter, insert\na new slide, think about I just said,\n\n54\n00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:32.545\ninsert new slide.\n\n55\n00:02:32.545 --> 00:02:35.525\nSo, if you didn't wanna go to\nthe Home tab on the ribbon,\n\n56\n00:02:35.525 --> 00:02:40.295\nyou can also go into the Insert Menu and\nyou can go from New Slide from that way.\n\n57\n00:02:40.295 --> 00:02:43.615\nBut I'm gonna pretty much\nconcentrate on the ribbon part and\n\n58\n00:02:43.615 --> 00:02:47.600\nnot necessarily the Menu, but I wanted\nto at least point that out to you.\n\n59\n00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.300\n&gt;&gt; Apparently Shift Command N\nwould also work.\n\n60\n00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.870\n&gt;&gt; You saw that didn't you?\n\n61\n00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.580\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, our shortcuts.\n\n62\n00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.380\nI know it as Control M from Windows.\n\n63\n00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes?\n&gt;&gt; So, that doesn't correlate into the Mac\n\n64\n00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.460\nversion, so yes.\n\n65\n00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.510\nAnytime, for those shortcuts,\nthat we always like to emphasize there.\n\n66\n00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.470\nYou can see on the right hand of your\nmenu's will give you those the keys or\n\n67\n00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.280\nthe keyboard shortcut for\nthat particular command,\n\n68\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.260\nso you can start kind of committing them\nto memory of what's in the menus and then,\n\n69\n00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.100\nyou can just start using them.\n\n70\n00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.390\nBut again, you don't have to,\nit's up to you.\n\n71\n00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.600\nI wanna add a new slide and start talking\nabout those different layouts and\n\n72\n00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.980\nmaybe changing layouts\nafter I've added slides.\n\n73\n00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.150\nLet's start with new slide.\n\n74\n00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.070\nThere's two different things,\nyou could click on a button or\n\n75\n00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.989\nthere's this little tiny drop-down thing,\nit is a drop-down actually.\n\n76\n00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.263\nIt's not such a thing.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's not like a drop-down.\n\n77\n00:03:41.263 --> 00:03:43.500\nIt is a drop-down.\n&gt;&gt; It is a drop-down, yes.\n\n78\n00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.380\nIf I click, let's do both, if I click on\nthe new slide button just to start it\n\n79\n00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.430\nwill always add a new slide because\nI have started on a slide 1,\n\n80\n00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.420\nwhich was a title slide\nin a new presentation,\n\n81\n00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:05.080\nthe next slide that it will always add\nwill be a title and content layout.\n\n82\n00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.200\nIt just thinks that the next slide\nyou're not gonna have two title slides\n\n83\n00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.160\nnecessarily, so it just thinks that, well,\n\n84\n00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.100\nthe next one you're gonna start\nis something about content.\n\n85\n00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.160\nSo, I'm going to give you\nthis slide layout by default,\n\n86\n00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.190\ngiving you a placeholder for\nadding a title and\n\n87\n00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.550\nit kind of tells you click to add\ntitle and then, click to add text.\n\n88\n00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.850\nAnd in content slides,\nor content placeholders,\n\n89\n00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.560\nyou also have these little buttons or\nthese kind of like dimmed out buttons that\n\n90\n00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.910\nwill allow you to insert a chart or\na SmartArt or a picture, right?\n\n91\n00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.260\nBecause that's content as well it\ndoesn't always have to be text based.\n\n92\n00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.070\nSo, that is just by default what it's\ngoing to give you when you add a new slide\n\n93\n00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.420\nto a title slide and a new presentation.\n\n94\n00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.730\nBut there's different levels,\nthere's gotta be a different way that I\n\n95\n00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.880\ncould add a new slide with a new\nlayout from the beginning and\n\n96\n00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.400\nthat's where that dropping down-\n&gt;&gt; Dropping down.\n\n97\n00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this little button\nright here the drop down button\n\n98\n00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.160\nnext to the new slide button it says,\n\n99\n00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.310\nall right well maybe you wanna add\na new slide with a Two Content layout.\n\n100\n00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.040\nSo, these slide layouts are just trying to\ngive you a head start as to add what you\n\n101\n00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.730\nwant to the slide cuz maybe I\nwanted to have a comparison, or\n\n102\n00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.130\nI wanted to compare Fuego and Bishop.\n\n103\n00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.760\nAnd i wanna to know what's the difference\nbetween Comparison and Two Content?\n\n104\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.850\nWell, let's see.\n\n105\n00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.810\nIf I click on the Two Content,\nit's just going to give me a title and\n\n106\n00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.690\ntwo content areas.\n\n107\n00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.120\nIf I add in another slide with comparison,\nthe difference is that this one gives you,\n\n108\n00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:41.250\nit's like a header for each side to be\nable to add all the content you want to.\n\n109\n00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.380\nAll of those default layouts For\nyour slides.\n\n110\n00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.290\nThen, notice, all our slides are blank.\n\n111\n00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.780\nEven though it says, click to add title,\n\n112\n00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.900\nclick to add text,\nthat's not going to show.\n\n113\n00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.630\nIf we ran this slide show\npresentation right now,\n\n114\n00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.710\nit would just be blank,\nblank, nothing, nothing.\n\n115\n00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.692\n&gt;&gt; That's exciting.\n\n116\n00:05:54.692 --> 00:05:55.192\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n117\n00:05:55.192 --> 00:05:57.481\nI have a presentation about nothing.\n\n118\n00:05:57.481 --> 00:05:58.144\n&gt;&gt; Oddly enough,\n\n119\n00:05:58.144 --> 00:06:01.750\nthis is exactly the content I wanted in\nthe slides, but they are not showing up.\n\n120\n00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.022\n[LAUGH] I wanted it to say,\n\n121\n00:06:03.022 --> 00:06:05.740\nclick to add title.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right Yes, yes,\n\n122\n00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.710\nthis does not show up.\n\n123\n00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.760\nIt is for us to kind of guide us\nalong as to what we should be doing.\n\n124\n00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.980\nSo, PowerPoint's nice like that,\nkind of tells you what to do.\n\n125\n00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.360\nNow, I'm adding all these slides and\nwe're getting into these layouts.\n\n126\n00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.260\nBut what if I have a slide, for\nexample, on slide 4 that I've added and\n\n127\n00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.420\nI told it to have the comparison layout,\nbut I didn't want that layout.\n\n128\n00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.529\nI want it to be A section side,\n\n129\n00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:36.280\nbecause maybe I wanna start a new section\nand I wanna have a visual representation\n\n130\n00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.990\nof now we're going into a different\narea of a presentation.\n\n131\n00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.780\nYou can come over here to\nthe layout button the ribbon and\n\n132\n00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.940\nyou can change the layout of this slide.\n\n133\n00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.460\nSo, maybe I wanted to\nmake a section header or\n\n134\n00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.770\nI wanted it to be a two content or\nI wanted it to be blank.\n\n135\n00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.910\nIt's just telling it\nto change the default,\n\n136\n00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.150\ncontent placeholders on the slide.\n\n137\n00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.390\nNow, since we have slides that\ndon't have anything in it.\n\n138\n00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.700\nRight now, we're really just kind of\nalmost like laying the groundwork for\n\n139\n00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.065\nourselves and\ngetting it to where we want it to be.\n\n140\n00:07:10.065 --> 00:07:14.034\nOr what we're gonna do in just a little\nbit is we're gonna open up a file that\n\n141\n00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:17.001\nalready has information and\ncontent created in there.\n\n142\n00:07:17.001 --> 00:07:20.504\nAnd then, see how changing the layout\nwill change the content and\n\n143\n00:07:20.504 --> 00:07:24.454\nit can either be nothing,\nlike nothing's wrong, everything's fine or\n\n144\n00:07:24.454 --> 00:07:27.600\nsometimes like,\nthat's kind of messes things up.\n\n145\n00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.690\nSo, we should maybe back track and\ndo some undo.\n\n146\n00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:32.970\nDefault layouts.\n\n147\n00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.940\nAdding new slides.\n\n148\n00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.980\nOne other way of adding a slide\njust in case you wanna go this way,\n\n149\n00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.270\nopen the slide pane area.\n\n150\n00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.055\nYou can right click on a slide and\nyou can go to new slide.\n\n151\n00:07:45.055 --> 00:07:50.073\nThen notice when I am right clicking here\nI am right clicking over an active slide.\n\n152\n00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:54.706\nAs opposed to if I go in a blank area\nlike below a slide it is still going to\n\n153\n00:07:54.706 --> 00:07:59.578\ngive me the option for a new slide but\ndo not have as many things as that whole\n\n154\n00:07:59.578 --> 00:08:04.058\nright clicking as to Where are you\nwhen you right-click on a slide or\n\n155\n00:08:04.058 --> 00:08:08.650\noff a slide and\nwhat options you're going to be given.\n\n156\n00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.040\nSo that's how you can add\na new slide from there.\n\n157\n00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.775\nLike I said, let's go ahead and\njump into a file that has some content and\n\n158\n00:08:13.775 --> 00:08:17.055\nwe can see some other\noptions with our layout.\n\n159\n00:08:17.055 --> 00:08:21.249\nSo I'm gonna go to the File menu,\nand I'm gonna go to Open, and\n\n160\n00:08:21.249 --> 00:08:25.917\nI'm going to go to on my Mac and\nfind the slide layout and objects file,\n\n161\n00:08:25.917 --> 00:08:28.231\nwhich is right in front of my face.\n\n162\n00:08:28.231 --> 00:08:31.312\nThere it is, and we are going to open it.\n\n163\n00:08:31.312 --> 00:08:34.816\nSo here's our presentation, now before we\nstart you're saying wow there's all sorts\n\n164\n00:08:34.816 --> 00:08:37.195\nof crazy things [LAUGH] going\non in this slide presentation.\n\n165\n00:08:37.195 --> 00:08:40.339\nWhy does this slide 3 look\ndifferent than slide 5?\n\n166\n00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:45.238\nI have on purpose specifically added\ndesign themes to only a couple of\n\n167\n00:08:45.238 --> 00:08:49.968\nslides to demonstrate what's gonna\nhappen when you start getting\n\n168\n00:08:49.968 --> 00:08:53.867\ninto design themes and\nhow that affects your layouts.\n\n169\n00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:57.863\nBecause when we were on our other file,\nwhich was just a blank presentation,\n\n170\n00:08:57.863 --> 00:09:00.443\nwith the basic Office theme,\nit still is a theme,\n\n171\n00:09:00.443 --> 00:09:04.360\neven though it doesn't look like\nthere's anything going on there.\n\n172\n00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.598\nThere were only specific layouts\nthat were available to me.\n\n173\n00:09:07.598 --> 00:09:12.098\nWell, if I switch over to\nthe Slide Layouts and Objects, and\n\n174\n00:09:12.098 --> 00:09:16.771\nI go on this first slide,\nif I go to my layout options, notice,\n\n175\n00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:20.942\nI have a whole other set of choices for\nthe Berlin theme.\n\n176\n00:09:20.942 --> 00:09:25.088\nAnd they have a three column or\na three picture column.\n\n177\n00:09:25.088 --> 00:09:29.130\nSo your layout, what layouts\nare associated with design themes it will\n\n178\n00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.330\nbe different depending on your theme.\n\n179\n00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.990\nSo if it kinda throws off like I don't\nhave that one it's because of the theme.\n\n180\n00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.030\nAnd notice here this green one,\n\n181\n00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.640\nthis one you could see that\nit's got picture with caption.\n\n182\n00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.440\nWe have a true and false and\na quote name card.\n\n183\n00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.169\nEven if you're like I don't even\nknow what that would be for [LAUGH].\n\n184\n00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:48.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's okay if you click on it,\n\n185\n00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.640\nall it's going to do is add\ndifferent types of default layouts.\n\n186\n00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.380\nIf you don't like it you\ncan always switch it.\n\n187\n00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:00.310\nBut notice right here on this slide, it\ndid already have content in the slide, so\n\n188\n00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.850\nhow it's determining what and\n\n189\n00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.690\nwhere the title's gonna go and\nhow it's gonna treat the sub-title.\n\n190\n00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.074\nIf I go back to that title side,\nit was fine this way, but\n\n191\n00:10:11.074 --> 00:10:13.597\nwhat if I changed it\nto a title in content.\n\n192\n00:10:13.597 --> 00:10:18.550\nNotice that the sub-title becomes like the\nnew bullet point in that content holder.\n\n193\n00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:23.120\nOr if I went to a content with caption,\nyou can see that's going to change\n\n194\n00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.760\nwhat information's already there,\nand how it's going to fit in those\n\n195\n00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.530\nother placeholder layouts that are for\nthat particular slide layout.\n\n196\n00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:36.680\nFor something as basic as this, you're\nnot gonna have much of an issue, but\n\n197\n00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:41.960\nif I go to something like say on slide 6,\nthis is a two content layout.\n\n198\n00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.750\nI have a table in one layout and a chart\nin another layout, and we have our title.\n\n199\n00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:51.120\nIf I change this to let's say a title and\ncontent slide, notice how because\n\n200\n00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:56.250\nthe table is first, it's kind of\noverlapping where the chart was.\n\n201\n00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.230\nAnd then if I then come back and\nput this into a title slide,\n\n202\n00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.358\nit's like I don't even\nknow what's going on here.\n\n203\n00:11:01.358 --> 00:11:05.290\nSo, it could\n\n204\n00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.650\nmess up some of your content because\nit just doesn't know where to put it.\n\n205\n00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:14.450\nThey are still independent objects\nthat you can move around and\n\n206\n00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.660\nreposition and\nkind of free form if you wanna say.\n\n207\n00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.470\nThat is still available but\n\n208\n00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:25.510\ntrying to keep within those specific\nplaceholders, it can get a little messy.\n\n209\n00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:29.180\n&gt;&gt; So please design layout responsibly,\nis what you're saying.\n\n210\n00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:29.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, yes, yes.\n\n211\n00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.600\nAnd if you mess it up too much,\nthat's okay.\n\n212\n00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.635\nWe can always undo.\n\n213\n00:11:33.635 --> 00:11:34.586\n&gt;&gt; Cmd+Z.\n\n214\n00:11:34.586 --> 00:11:35.162\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n215\n00:11:35.162 --> 00:11:37.426\nCtrl+Z or I just-\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n216\n00:11:37.426 --> 00:11:39.360\n&gt;&gt; You said Cmd and I said Ctrl.\n\n217\n00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.016\n[LAUGH] We're gonna-\n&gt;&gt; This is a Mac show.\n\n218\n00:11:41.016 --> 00:11:42.677\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Now remember this.\n\n219\n00:11:42.677 --> 00:11:45.090\nYes, yes, Cmd Ctrl, Cmd, Ctrl, it's Cmd.\n\n220\n00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:49.570\nSo I'm just gonna keep on doing and\nI can undo as far back as I need to,\n\n221\n00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.830\nto get to a point where like yep,\nall right,\n\n222\n00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.010\nI've done my undos enough to\nwhere this is where I wanna be.\n\n223\n00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.680\nAnd so those are your different layouts\nand how you can manipulate them.\n\n224\n00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.610\nWhat if I want to change\nthe order of our slides?\n\n225\n00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:07.313\nBecause we have slide 3, which says We Can\nMake a Text Slide, before the Fuego and\n\n226\n00:12:07.313 --> 00:12:08.210\nBishop slide.\n\n227\n00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:13.036\nAnd maybe I've decided, hm, well,\nI want Fuego and Bishop to go before that.\n\n228\n00:12:13.036 --> 00:12:17.020\nReorganizing, first way we could\ndo it is over here in slides pane,\n\n229\n00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.030\nyou can just click and drag,\nand you can move your slides.\n\n230\n00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.720\nYou just have to watch for the line.\n\n231\n00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.020\nWhat I mean is this, click,\nhold and drag, you see that line?\n\n232\n00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.960\nIf I let go right now,\nit's just gonna stay.\n\n233\n00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.850\nIf I click, hold and drag,\nI gotta go all the way up to\n\n234\n00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.970\nwhere that line shows that when you let\ngo this is where you're going to drop it.\n\n235\n00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.950\nIt's going to be after slide 2.\n\n236\n00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.940\nAnd then I've just rearranged my slides,\npretty easy.\n\n237\n00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.120\nNice and easy way in the slide pane.\n\n238\n00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:49.390\nIf you have a lot of slides, and\nmaybe I need slide 2 to go to slide 55,\n\n239\n00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.720\nthen that's a little\nbit further of a jump.\n\n240\n00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.860\nI would say the easiest way to do it\nis go into the slide sorter view.\n\n241\n00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.250\nNow, I was going by the buttons and some\nother episodes down here on the bottom but\n\n242\n00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:03.400\nyou can always go up to your\nview tab on your ribbon and\n\n243\n00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.850\nthat will give you the same\noptions just in a different place.\n\n244\n00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.560\nSo we're gonna go over to\nour slide sorter view.\n\n245\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.280\nI meant sort slides, okay nicely named.\n\n246\n00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.120\nSo I wanna move these around,\nI could take slide 3 and\n\n247\n00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.540\nI could put it all the way over\nbehind slide 8 or between slide 7.\n\n248\n00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:25.090\nIt does give you a little bit more of\na graphical representation of what's going\n\n249\n00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:26.130\non, I could say.\n\n250\n00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.940\nYour slides are actually moving.\n\n251\n00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.351\nYou don't have to watch for the little\nline when you're in the slide pane,\n\n252\n00:13:31.351 --> 00:13:32.280\nin the normal view.\n\n253\n00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.530\n&gt;&gt; I like that,\nhow it kind of moves out of the way and\n\n254\n00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.390\nsays here's where you\nwould like to drop that?\n\n255\n00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.340\nYes, no?\n\n256\n00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.650\nLet go of the button if you like.\n\n257\n00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.750\nIf not, just keeping dragging around.\n\n258\n00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.870\n&gt;&gt; It's a bigger notification I'd say.\n\n259\n00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.945\nAll right, here's where you're at.\n\n260\n00:13:45.945 --> 00:13:50.887\nAnd if you have a lot of slides you could\nalways come down here to our zoom and\n\n261\n00:13:50.887 --> 00:13:54.711\nyou can zoom in and out of our\nslides to be able to see more or\n\n262\n00:13:54.711 --> 00:13:58.340\nless slides in one area in\nour slide's order of view.\n\n263\n00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.703\nAnd a little tip or trick.\n\n264\n00:14:01.703 --> 00:14:03.230\nWe'll call it a trick.\n&gt;&gt; We'll call it a trick.\n\n265\n00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.440\n&gt;&gt; If we're in the slide sorter view and\n\n266\n00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.590\nI wanted to get back to the normal view,\nif you double-click on any of your slides,\n\n267\n00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.920\nit's gonna actually take you\nright into the normal view.\n\n268\n00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.500\nAnd then activate that particular\nslide that you had double clicked on,\n\n269\n00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.050\nwhich is kinda cute.\n\n270\n00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.270\nLittle bit more with our slides.\n\n271\n00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:23.200\nI like slide 4 with a compare and\nmaybe I have, I wanna compare some\n\n272\n00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.690\nother things and maybe half of\nthe information is already there.\n\n273\n00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:29.954\nI don't wanna have to\nrecreate the entire thing.\n\n274\n00:14:29.954 --> 00:14:32.570\nYou could always duplicate your slide.\n\n275\n00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.794\nA duplicate is almost, it's really\nthe same thing as cut and paste, or\n\n276\n00:14:35.794 --> 00:14:36.560\nsorry, copy.\n\n277\n00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.220\nI could copy a slide and paste it.\n\n278\n00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.280\nDuplicate is really the same thing.\n\n279\n00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.880\nHow do I duplicate a sIide?\n\n280\n00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.520\nEasiest way I think is right-clicking\non a slide in a slide pane and\n\n281\n00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.530\nI could say Duplicate Slide.\n\n282\n00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.798\nAnd now I have a second version, and\nthis is where I could come into that and\n\n283\n00:14:53.798 --> 00:14:55.449\nthen change out some of the content.\n\n284\n00:14:55.449 --> 00:14:58.206\nIt's like, why reinvent the wheel\nif it's already half built?\n\n285\n00:14:58.206 --> 00:15:02.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like to do this so\nI can see what the changes are gonna do.\n\n286\n00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:06.310\nSo if I don't wanna mess with my original\ncopy, I make a duplicate slide and\n\n287\n00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.540\nthen I start making my changes.\n\n288\n00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.720\nIf it goes haywire and\nI'm 27 steps into the thing,\n\n289\n00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.000\nI'm like I'm not backing out of this.\n\n290\n00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I'll just smoke it,\ndelete that slide.\n\n291\n00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.190\nAnd I still have my original,\nand I can go back again.\n\n292\n00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:18.010\n&gt;&gt; That's a great example.\n\n293\n00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.808\nI actually to do that a lot in Photoshop\nwith layers, it's like do I want this?\n\n294\n00:15:21.808 --> 00:15:24.610\nThat's okay,\nwell just in case I got a backup.\n\n295\n00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.976\nAnd perfect segue into then well, what if\nI wanted to delete one of these slides?\n\n296\n00:15:27.976 --> 00:15:28.911\n&gt;&gt; It's garbage.\n\n297\n00:15:28.911 --> 00:15:29.480\nGet rid of it.\n\n298\n00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.100\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You gotta go.\n\n299\n00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:31.779\nRight click again, and\nyou can go ahead and hit the Delete Slide.\n\n300\n00:15:31.779 --> 00:15:36.601\nAnd then it deletes out of there.\n\n301\n00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.550\nYou can also hit the Delete\nkey on your keyboard.\n\n302\n00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.470\nSo you gotta be a little\ncareful about that.\n\n303\n00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:42.042\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] keyboard happy.\n\n304\n00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:45.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you're like wait, I didn't\ntype any text, I didn't delete any text.\n\n305\n00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.666\nYou're actually deleting slides, because\nyou are over here in an active slide.\n\n306\n00:15:49.666 --> 00:15:53.405\nAnd if you hit the Delete key, it thinks\nthat you are deleting that slide.\n\n307\n00:15:53.405 --> 00:15:54.112\n&gt;&gt; Cmd+Z.\n\n308\n00:15:54.112 --> 00:15:54.705\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n309\n00:15:54.705 --> 00:15:56.040\n&gt;&gt; Right, undo your Your delete.\n\n310\n00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.513\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Undo your undo delete, yes.\n\n311\n00:15:58.513 --> 00:16:00.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Starting to circle it.\n\n312\n00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:02.041\n&gt;&gt; Here we go.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You could also, so\n\n313\n00:16:02.041 --> 00:16:06.818\ndeleting is one way but maybe like we were\nsaying, I'm not sure if I wanna get rid of\n\n314\n00:16:06.818 --> 00:16:10.300\nthat but I don't really wanna\nshow it in the presentation.\n\n315\n00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.610\nYou could also hide a slide if\nyou right-click on a slide.\n\n316\n00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.950\nHide Slide.\n\n317\n00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.500\nAnd it gives you that indication there\nthat it is kind of dimmed out and\n\n318\n00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:23.790\nsays nope, I'm not going to go ahead and\nshow this when I do the presentation.\n\n319\n00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:28.030\nYou see it as the creator but they don't\nsee it when you do the presentation.\n\n320\n00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:31.140\nSo hiding a slide can\nbe nice things there.\n\n321\n00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.170\nSections, we talked about\nthat in some other episodes.\n\n322\n00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:39.660\nI want to add a section\nright here after slide two.\n\n323\n00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:45.210\nI want to say that slide three and\nfour is a section about text slides.\n\n324\n00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.470\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, yeah.\n\n325\n00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.550\n&gt;&gt; How do I add a section?\n\n326\n00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.970\nSame way,\nyou can either right-click on this side,\n\n327\n00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:55.590\nyou can also right-click in between\nthe slides and add a section.\n\n328\n00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.180\nOr you can come over\nhere to the home tab and\n\n329\n00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.410\nin the home tab you can go with section\nand you can say, add a section.\n\n330\n00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:05.460\nBut you do need to think about where am I,\nbefore you add a section so\n\n331\n00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.010\nif I'm on slide three,\nif I've activated here.\n\n332\n00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:10.720\nNow I wanna make a section.\n\n333\n00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.860\nI can add it and\nnotice that because I was on slide\n\n334\n00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:16.930\nthree saying that this is\nthe start of your new section.\n\n335\n00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.110\nOr if I was between two and three,\nso just always like where am I,\n\n336\n00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:22.830\nit's kind of like the whole\neverything in PowerPoint.\n\n337\n00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:23.630\nWhere are you?\n\n338\n00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:24.800\nWhere is your mouse cursor?\n\n339\n00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.070\nWhat are you doing?\n\n340\n00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.610\nAnd sometimes you think\nfaster than the program.\n\n341\n00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:32.430\n&gt;&gt; You gotta make sure you know\nwhere the program has its focus.\n\n342\n00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:33.410\n&gt;&gt; It's fine in my mind.\n\n343\n00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:34.320\nI'm like go, go, go, go, go.\n\n344\n00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.080\nI'm like wait,\n\n345\n00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.669\nI didn't tell you where you're\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n346\n00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:37.860\n&gt;&gt; Supposed to go.\n\n347\n00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.020\nSo what am I gonna name this?\n\n348\n00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:43.600\nI'm gonna name this textslides and\nthen slides.\n\n349\n00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.240\nAnd I can rename this.\n\n350\n00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.365\nAnd then you can see that it went ahead\nand did all of it from here on down.\n\n351\n00:17:49.365 --> 00:17:53.330\nSlide three all the way down to\nslide 8 has become a section.\n\n352\n00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:58.460\nBut maybe I wanted to stop I wanna make\na new section here at slide 6 where\n\n353\n00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.200\nwe're gonna talk about SmartArt.\n\n354\n00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.020\nI'm really just kind of making\nthis up as we go along.\n\n355\n00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.820\nI wanna create a section here.\n\n356\n00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:11.860\nLet's go with Add Section, and\nthen I could name this other items.\n\n357\n00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:12.394\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n358\n00:18:12.394 --> 00:18:14.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And then you can rename.\n\n359\n00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.884\n&gt;&gt; Someone's gonna try to present this\npresentation and they're gonna be like,\n\n360\n00:18:17.884 --> 00:18:18.695\nwhat is going on?\n\n361\n00:18:18.695 --> 00:18:22.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's one of those like I know\nmy files, I know why I did things,\n\n362\n00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.060\nand I've actually come\nto files years later.\n\n363\n00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:29.220\nI just did this and it was a project\nI was doing many, many years ago.\n\n364\n00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.810\nI went back and I looked at the file,\nI'm like why did I name the files this?\n\n365\n00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.715\nThis doesn't make any sense.\n\n366\n00:18:33.715 --> 00:18:34.626\n&gt;&gt; Who's the crazy-\n&gt;&gt; It might work.\n\n367\n00:18:34.626 --> 00:18:36.684\n&gt;&gt; Schizophrenic that made\nthis PowerPoint presentation?\n\n368\n00:18:36.684 --> 00:18:37.673\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n369\n00:18:37.673 --> 00:18:38.407\nYes.\n\n370\n00:18:38.407 --> 00:18:39.118\nI know my mess.\n\n371\n00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:40.315\n&gt;&gt; That would be.\n[LAUGH]\n\n372\n00:18:40.315 --> 00:18:41.592\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know exactly where that one\n\n373\n00:18:41.592 --> 00:18:43.551\npiece of clothing, and\nwhen my mom would get mad at me,\n\n374\n00:18:43.551 --> 00:18:45.057\nwhen I was, you didn't do your laundry.\n\n375\n00:18:45.057 --> 00:18:45.801\nI know where that is, cuz it's my mess.\n\n376\n00:18:45.801 --> 00:18:46.356\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n377\n00:18:46.356 --> 00:18:48.440\nI'm the same way, my goodness.\n\n378\n00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.834\nIt drives people crazy.\n\n379\n00:18:49.834 --> 00:18:50.811\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Except for the person that does it.\n\n380\n00:18:50.811 --> 00:18:52.785\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah.\n\n381\n00:18:52.785 --> 00:18:53.290\n[LAUGH] Okay, so.\n\n382\n00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.030\n&gt;&gt; We're really moving\noff this topic here.\n\n383\n00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:56.530\n&gt;&gt; Well what if I have this section?\n\n384\n00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.565\nLet's say I made a section,\nand I came back and I'm like,\n\n385\n00:18:58.565 --> 00:18:59.655\nthat doesn't make any sense.\n\n386\n00:18:59.655 --> 00:19:03.705\nWhat if I wanted to rename this section,\nI'm on that slide six,\n\n387\n00:19:03.705 --> 00:19:08.511\nl have the section highlighted if you\nwanna say if you can see that it's red.\n\n388\n00:19:08.511 --> 00:19:12.497\nIf l go to section up on\nmy home tab on the ribbon,\n\n389\n00:19:12.497 --> 00:19:17.730\nyou can rename it and\nl can name it a better section name.\n\n390\n00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:18.632\n&gt;&gt; That is better.\n\n391\n00:19:18.632 --> 00:19:19.144\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n392\n00:19:19.144 --> 00:19:21.720\n&gt;&gt; And l can go on with that, you can\n\n393\n00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.220\nalways remove a section if you didn't like\nthat, you can also so you can collapse and\n\n394\n00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.150\nexpand the different sections like\ncollapse all that's actually nice if\n\n395\n00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.320\nyou have lots and lots of sections,\na quick way to get them all collapse.\n\n396\n00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.090\nI like that command and then you could\nalso go ahead and expand them all.\n\n397\n00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.090\nTo, well, expand them all.\n\n398\n00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.794\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It be really good to organize your\n\n399\n00:19:41.794 --> 00:19:43.688\ninformation.\n\n400\n00:19:43.688 --> 00:19:46.990\nSo all these different things about\nhow to add slides, delete slides,\n\n401\n00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:48.550\nreorganize slides.\n\n402\n00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:53.550\n&gt;&gt; But before we leave, I would like\nto talk about the objects on a slide.\n\n403\n00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:56.680\nCuz once you make a slide,\nyou have to put content in.\n\n404\n00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:01.080\nBefore we get into adding our text and\nadding our SmartArt,\n\n405\n00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:06.430\nvery basic concepts of your\nmouse cursor icons, I cannot\n\n406\n00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.280\nstress this enough about talking about-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n407\n00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.441\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking too fast.\n\n408\n00:20:10.441 --> 00:20:13.025\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know where I'm at.\n\n409\n00:20:13.025 --> 00:20:16.467\nThe other thing is always making sure\nbefore you click on something what does\n\n410\n00:20:16.467 --> 00:20:19.963\nyour mouse cursor look like, because\ndepending on what the mouse cursor look\n\n411\n00:20:19.963 --> 00:20:22.636\nlike, is depending on what\nyou're going to actually do.\n\n412\n00:20:22.636 --> 00:20:25.550\nI'm out here in slide two.\n\n413\n00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:29.080\nIf I'm not over anything I just\nhave this solid, black arrow.\n\n414\n00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:33.620\nThat means that you're not over anything,\nyou're just kind of in blank land.\n\n415\n00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n416\n00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.460\n&gt;&gt; If I move my mouse over an object,\nfour pointed arrows.\n\n417\n00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.800\nIf you get a four pointed arrow,\n\n418\n00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.110\nthat means you're over an object\nthat can be clicked on.\n\n419\n00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.030\nIf I move my mouse a little bit\nfurther down it turns to an I-beam.\n\n420\n00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:49.740\nIf it looks like a little I-beam,\nthen that means you are over text.\n\n421\n00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.765\nSo all in within this one little area,\n\n422\n00:20:52.765 --> 00:20:56.430\nthat's indicates what's\ngonna happen when you click.\n\n423\n00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.214\nIf I have the I-beam when I click,\n\n424\n00:20:59.214 --> 00:21:03.438\nI've activated the text and\nI could type in my text.\n\n425\n00:21:03.438 --> 00:21:06.315\nMy backspace and\nthen I still have my I-beam.\n\n426\n00:21:06.315 --> 00:21:09.220\nAnother thing that I've always\ntried to emphasize here is like,\n\n427\n00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.030\nwell now I wanna do something different.\n\n428\n00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.363\nAnd so you gotta click off of this,\nyou have to say,\n\n429\n00:21:13.363 --> 00:21:14.841\nall right stop what I'm doing.\n\n430\n00:21:14.841 --> 00:21:20.319\nLet's reset ourselves, if you take the\nblack arrow into like the blank land and\n\n431\n00:21:20.319 --> 00:21:25.308\nyou just click, then you're deactivating\nwhatever you had on before,\n\n432\n00:21:25.308 --> 00:21:26.970\nso that's a big thing.\n\n433\n00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:31.280\nI stress this in PowerPoint and everywhere\nelse and wait I just said, PowerPoint.\n\n434\n00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:31.950\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n&gt;&gt; Photoshop-\n\n435\n00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.055\n&gt;&gt; You do use it in PowerPoint.\n\n436\n00:21:33.055 --> 00:21:33.955\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We just watched it.\n\n437\n00:21:33.955 --> 00:21:35.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's where you,\n\n438\n00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.210\nremember you have to know\nwhere you are at all times.\n\n439\n00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:39.297\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n440\n00:21:39.297 --> 00:21:41.240\n&gt;&gt; I'm not in PowerPoint,\nno I am in PowerPoint.\n\n441\n00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:41.980\n&gt;&gt; You are in PowerPoint.\n\n442\n00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.060\n&gt;&gt; Wow, okay so make sure you\nwatch your mouse cursor icons.\n\n443\n00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.520\n&gt;&gt; This is fun ladies and gentlemen.\n\n444\n00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.765\nWe're having a good time.\n\n445\n00:21:47.765 --> 00:21:52.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And how to, I wanted to show it\non slide 1 how it's a little different,\n\n446\n00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:55.150\nthat four pointed arrow,\nlet's go back to slide two.\n\n447\n00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:59.170\nI was in this area,\nI know where the boundaries of that\n\n448\n00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:04.330\nplace holder are at because\nit is filled in with orange.\n\n449\n00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:08.000\nIf I come over here,\nit's the same exact slide, same layout.\n\n450\n00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.620\nBut if I put my mouse right about here,\nit's not showing anything.\n\n451\n00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:14.390\nThere's no four-pointed arrows\nbecause it doesn't see anything.\n\n452\n00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:19.240\nThere's no fill right there, but if I\nmove my mouse up right there, see that?\n\n453\n00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.680\nThat four-point arrow is\nsaying I found the edge or\n\n454\n00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:27.820\nthe boundary of that placeholder so if you\nclick now you're going to activate it.\n\n455\n00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.550\nIf you click here\nnothing's gonna happen but\n\n456\n00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.330\nif you move down in here there's the text.\n\n457\n00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:36.010\nSo it might be that it doesn't\nsee something cuz it's blank.\n\n458\n00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:39.990\nAs supposed to filled in text I get\nthe four point arrow in the middle\n\n459\n00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:41.030\nof this placeholder.\n\n460\n00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:44.210\n&gt;&gt; So, when I make my slides of\nwhite text on a white background and\n\n461\n00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:47.637\nI need to find out where that text\nis I just look for the little iBeam.\n\n462\n00:22:47.637 --> 00:22:48.686\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly.\n\n463\n00:22:48.686 --> 00:22:50.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Nobody else will\nbe able to see anything.\n\n464\n00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.180\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\nAnd\n\n465\n00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.990\nthe nice thing is once\nyou have that iBeam and\n\n466\n00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:56.300\nI click, then it actually activates\nthe whole box that it lives in.\n\n467\n00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.850\nSo if you can't ever find the four\npointed arrow, just click in there.\n\n468\n00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.520\nAnd then you can move your mouse.\n\n469\n00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.493\nAnd notice how if I wanted to move the box\naround, I get to the four pointed,\n\n470\n00:23:05.493 --> 00:23:06.180\nnot there.\n\n471\n00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:07.360\n&gt;&gt; Right there, four pointed arrow.\n\n472\n00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.770\nI've now activated, like, the box.\n\n473\n00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:13.940\nI make sure I stay on the four pointed\narrow and then I can move that around.\n\n474\n00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.904\nSo doing that with things\nthat don't have fills,\n\n475\n00:23:16.904 --> 00:23:19.311\nyou do have to kind of watch your spaces.\n\n476\n00:23:19.311 --> 00:23:23.050\nIf I'm over on slide two,\nI could just click, hold, and drag,\n\n477\n00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:26.744\nand just move this,\ncuz it already knows I'm over something.\n\n478\n00:23:26.744 --> 00:23:30.750\nSo that four point arrow does\nmean move in this context and\n\n479\n00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:32.548\nreally any context-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n480\n00:23:32.548 --> 00:23:33.470\n&gt;&gt; Is it's move.\n\n481\n00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:36.000\nThe other things you're\ngoing to be looking for\n\n482\n00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.314\nwith an activated placeholder or context\nobject thing is the two pointed arrow.\n\n483\n00:23:40.314 --> 00:23:45.361\nThe two pointed arrow is if you come\nto any of the sides, rather the corner,\n\n484\n00:23:45.361 --> 00:23:50.592\nor the top or the bottoms, and that way\nyou can resize and change That object.\n\n485\n00:23:50.592 --> 00:23:54.485\nAnd if you go from the corner\nyou could do both the width and\n\n486\n00:23:54.485 --> 00:23:56.490\nheight at the same time.\n\n487\n00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:01.472\nIt does give you that little tool\ntip to tell you exactly how big,\n\n488\n00:24:01.472 --> 00:24:06.110\nhow wide and how high the object\nis that you're resizing.\n\n489\n00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:07.030\n&gt;&gt; I've noticed that also,\n\n490\n00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:11.690\nwhen you pulled it from the left, the left\nis what resizes the right stays static.\n\n491\n00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:14.580\nSo if I grabbed it from the right,\nthe left would stay static and\n\n492\n00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.726\nthe right would resize.\n\n493\n00:24:15.726 --> 00:24:17.120\nSo just be aware.\n\n494\n00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.520\nNot that you can't get the same\ndimensions but it's just-\n\n495\n00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.500\n&gt;&gt; But the anchoring.\n\n496\n00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.046\nWhere it's anchoring is the opposite\ncorner when you grab that,\n\n497\n00:24:24.046 --> 00:24:25.280\nor the opposite side.\n\n498\n00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.930\nYou grab from left or the right and\nthat is a very good point.\n\n499\n00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:32.960\nSo two pointed arrow resize,\nfour pointed arrow move, I beam.\n\n500\n00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.640\nYou also have a little\nswirly arrow on top and\n\n501\n00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:40.490\nthat will reorient or rotate that object.\n\n502\n00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:43.730\nAnd then you could go ahead and change\nall sorts of different things in here and\n\n503\n00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.340\nthen maybe that's,\nyou want some kind of funky.\n\n504\n00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.430\nAnd notice I was trying to drag and\n\n505\n00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:52.660\nwhat was happening is I was just selecting\ntext because I was in the I beam.\n\n506\n00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:56.570\nif I want to move it, I have to be on the\nfour pointed arrow to move that object.\n\n507\n00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:03.270\nSo just being able to control objects on\nyour slides is going to be very important.\n\n508\n00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:07.880\nJust watch those I beams, that will\ntell you what you're going to do.\n\n509\n00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:11.710\nBut before we leave here,\nI've really messed this up, right?\n\n510\n00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And maybe I've gotten it so\n\n511\n00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.170\nmuch to where I've already saved this,\nI've closed the file,\n\n512\n00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:17.290\nI've opened it back up.\n\n513\n00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:21.480\nAnd now my undo's don't work because\nyour undo's are only in that session or\n\n514\n00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.170\nthat time that you have that file open.\n\n515\n00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.670\nOnce you close it,\nall that history goes away.\n\n516\n00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:28.440\nYou do have a Reset.\n\n517\n00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.500\nReset Slide.\n\n518\n00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.980\n&gt;&gt; It does exactly what it says,\nit resets it back.\n\n519\n00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.930\nIt does not delete any of your content.\n\n520\n00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:38.730\nIt sets is back to whatever\nthe layout that you had determined or\n\n521\n00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:44.110\nhad committed to this slide, it takes away\nall the formatting, all the resizing,\n\n522\n00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:49.070\nand puts you right back to\nthe default locations of the slides,\n\n523\n00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:52.690\nwhich can be really nice,\ncuz you can get yourself kind of-\n\n524\n00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:53.850\n&gt;&gt; Deep in the weeds?\n\n525\n00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:57.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I don't where to bring myself\nout, so I really do like the reset slide.\n\n526\n00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:02.320\n&gt;&gt; And even if you didn't save it,\nyou could be 40, 50 changes into it.\n\n527\n00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.058\nAnd go I'm not control\nZ'ing this back 40 times.\n\n528\n00:26:06.058 --> 00:26:08.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\nLet's just start from the beginning,\n\n529\n00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:12.890\nstart over, so that it can be a lot\nfaster way to get back to center and\n\n530\n00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.030\nstart reconfiguring.\n\n531\n00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:18.575\n&gt;&gt; And I think the reset it kinda\nindicates that I'm gonna delete everything\n\n532\n00:26:18.575 --> 00:26:19.830\nand it doesn't.\n\n533\n00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:20.840\nIt'll keep your content,\n\n534\n00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.840\nyour content does not go away\nit's just formatting, location.\n\n535\n00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:28.150\nAnd yeah, format and\nlocation, and resizing.\n\n536\n00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:29.970\n&gt;&gt; And resizing, don't forget that one.\n\n537\n00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:33.410\nAll right, well it looks like we\nhave now learned about slides indide\n\n538\n00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:34.070\nof PowerPoint 2016.\n\n539\n00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.980\nShould be a whole lot more familiar\nby the end of this episode\n\n540\n00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.480\nthan you were if you when you started\nif you've never seen PowerPoint before.\n\n541\n00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.800\nAnd then maybe if you have, maybe you\npicked up a trick or two along the way.\n\n542\n00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.915\nThat's our hope and goal anyway [LAUGH].\n\n543\n00:26:45.915 --> 00:26:49.620\nVonne, we do appreciate your time and\neffort in on this and very well done.\n\n544\n00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.880\nI know I learned a lot,\nhopefully you did as well.\n\n545\n00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.800\nBut I'm looking at our clock and\nguess what, she's ticked her last talk for\n\n546\n00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:55.525\nthis episode.\n\n547\n00:26:55.525 --> 00:26:56.870\n&gt;&gt;

to add text\ninto our our slides.\n\n34\n00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.250\nAnd the nice thing about it is that it\nkinda helps us along with those title, or\n\n35\n00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.030\nthose content placeholders.\n\n36\n00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.710\nAnd for this particular title slide,\nit's letting us know, hey,\n\n37\n00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.645\nif you wanna go ahead and\nadd a title, click here.\n\n38\n00:01:25.645 --> 00:01:28.025\nIf you want to add a subtitle, click here.\n\n39\n00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:29.155\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\n\n40\n00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:32.845\nfollow a PowerPoint's instructions and\ndo exactly what it says.\n\n41\n00:01:32.845 --> 00:01:35.115\nWe're gonna make sure that\nwe get our I-beam cursor so\n\n42\n00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:37.085\nwe know that we're adding text.\n\n43\n00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:40.615\nAnd we click and then it goes ahead and\ngets our flashing cursor.\n\n44\n00:01:40.615 --> 00:01:42.195\nThat let's us know that, hey,\n\n45\n00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:45.725\nwhen you start typing right now\nthis is where the text is gonna go.\n\n46\n00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:50.170\nSo we're gonna add text\nbecause I don't have\n\n47\n00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.900\nanything else to think about because\nthat's what we're going to do.\n\n48\n00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.430\nSo this PowerPoint presentation\nis about adding text.\n\n49\n00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.630\nAnd I could go ahead and click to add\na subtitle and maybe I'll go ahead and\n\n50\n00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.940\njust put our company name of ITProTV.\n\n51\n00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.160\nAnd I have filled in the content\nplace holders just like I have\n\n52\n00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.290\nbeen instructed to do so.\n\n53\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.020\nAs a small little side note,\nlets just say maybe I didn't want to\n\n54\n00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.228\nhave a subtitle, I just wanted a title for\nwhatever reason.\n\n55\n00:02:19.228 --> 00:02:24.630\nYou don't have to keep all\n\n56\n00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.440\nof the placeholders that it gives you on\na slide and for ever reason you don't\n\n57\n00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.560\nwant that there, you can get rid of\nthe entire box of the entire thing.\n\n58\n00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.690\nYou just gotta make sure\nthat you get on to the four\n\n59\n00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.720\npointed arrows which we\ntalked about in our previous\n\n60\n00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.910\nepisode about making sure you understand\nwhat your mouse cursor pointer icons do.\n\n61\n00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.340\nAnd if I click on that,\nthat activates the entire placeholder.\n\n62\n00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.790\nAnd then I can hit the Delete key,\nand then it tells me that, well,\n\n63\n00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.321\nI actually didn't do it totally right.\n\n64\n00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:54.804\n[LAUGH] So let me go ahead and\ndo it again.\n\n65\n00:02:54.804 --> 00:02:56.670\nThere we go, I guess-\n&gt;&gt; You have to always do it twice, right?\n\n66\n00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] right?\n\n67\n00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:58.720\nWell-\n&gt;&gt; Little caveat.\n\n68\n00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.270\n&gt;&gt; At least for today, for\ntoday we're going to do it twice.\n\n69\n00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.901\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n70\n00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:02.413\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n71\n00:03:02.413 --> 00:03:03.007\n&gt;&gt; Normally it should happen with one\n\n72\n00:03:03.007 --> 00:03:04.743\nclick.\n&gt;&gt; In one click [LAUGH]\n\n73\n00:03:04.743 --> 00:03:05.304\n&gt;&gt; If it doesnt work for\n\n74\n00:03:05.304 --> 00:03:06.634\nthe first time just try again\n&gt;&gt; There you go\n\n75\n00:03:06.634 --> 00:03:07.155\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n76\n00:03:07.155 --> 00:03:10.766\nSo I can remove the place holder boxes if\n\n77\n00:03:10.766 --> 00:03:12.884\nI wanted to.\nAnd then of course,\n\n78\n00:03:12.884 --> 00:03:15.930\nif I really dint like that I can always\ngo back and reset that slide and\n\n79\n00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.606\nit will give me the place holder.\nSo you do have some freedom of, well,\n\n80\n00:03:19.606 --> 00:03:23.300\nyou're telling me to do something\nI dont really want to do that.\n\n81\n00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.550\n&gt;&gt; This are more suggestions than hard and\nfast rules, as it where.\n\n82\n00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.100\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.\n\n83\n00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.610\nSo it's like I'm guiding you along,\n\n84\n00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.200\nbut you are the ruler so\nI will go with what you want to say.\n\n85\n00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.960\nSo, I will go ahead and\nput ITProTV back in there.\n\n86\n00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.290\n&gt;&gt; Not because it told you, though.\n\n87\n00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.020\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Because you want to.\n\n88\n00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.950\nWhatever helps you think at night, Vonne.\n\n89\n00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you.\n\n90\n00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.720\nAll right, so now that I've gone and put\nin some text, I think that's it's really,\n\n91\n00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.620\nI don't wanna say it really is that easy,\nyou just click and type.\n\n92\n00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.440\nBut it does give you a nice\nguidance of what you need to do.\n\n93\n00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.430\nNow, when I get into some more complex,\n\n94\n00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.730\nwe'll say, slides,\nin the sense of now I have titles, and\n\n95\n00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.480\nnow I'm gonna start adding topics\nwithin this title and content slide.\n\n96\n00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.010\nNow, we're gonna start talking about how\nwe can format our list and the different\n\n97\n00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.195\nways that we can use some tips and\ntricks to get the information in properly.\n\n98\n00:04:17.195 --> 00:04:19.707\nAnd what we can do when it gets too much.\n\n99\n00:04:19.707 --> 00:04:23.555\nAnd PowerPoint gives us even\nmore suggestions to help us out.\n\n100\n00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:28.705\nSo let's go ahead and click to add a title\nand we're going to say my list items.\n\n101\n00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.060\n&gt;&gt; Very descriptive.\n\n102\n00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you.\n\n103\n00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.780\nSo we'll go in and\nI'm gonna click on that first icon,\n\n104\n00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.460\nor that first place there where\nit says add your content.\n\n105\n00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.950\nAnd it automatically is going to\nformat this in a bulleted list.\n\n106\n00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.560\nEven though it looks kind of dimmed down,\nlike is it there, is it not there?\n\n107\n00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.240\nIt really is.\n\n108\n00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.810\nIf you just start typing, and I'm gonna\nsay typing, then it goes ahead and\n\n109\n00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.007\nkinda highlights itself and says,\n\n110\n00:04:55.007 --> 00:04:59.058\nyes, I'm already formatted in a bulleted\nlist because that is just the way that\n\n111\n00:04:59.058 --> 00:05:01.955\nPowerPoint is saying here is the first\nthing we are going to talk about here.\n\n112\n00:05:01.955 --> 00:05:03.390\nHere's the second thing\nI'm going to talk about.\n\n113\n00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.580\nSo it's giving you that list.\n\n114\n00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.170\nCan you format this and\nmake it look all different?\n\n115\n00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.060\nTotally.\n\n116\n00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.500\nWe're gonna do that in another episode,\nthough.\n\n117\n00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.240\nToday we're just gonna, just get the text\nin and save all of the making it\n\n118\n00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.780\npretty and colorful and changing\nspacing for formatting our text next.\n\n119\n00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.440\n&gt;&gt; Got to learn to walk before we run,\nright Ladies and Gentlemen?\n\n120\n00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.220\nYou can't just jump all willy-nilly\ninto making these things glow purple and\n\n121\n00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.030\ndo crazy stuff.\n\n122\n00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.890\nThat's we know how to actually have\nto put something there first so.\n\n123\n00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.650\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what we're doing,\nperfect.\n\n124\n00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.090\nSo once we're here,\nI need to add another item into my list.\n\n125\n00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.810\nHow do I do that?\n\n126\n00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:36.830\nJust hit Enter.\n\n127\n00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.408\nWhen you Enter,\n\n128\n00:05:37.408 --> 00:05:42.670\nthen it just takes you down to the next\nitem in this particular level of my list.\n\n129\n00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.120\nBecause sometimes if we're typing in,\nso this is like my main topic.\n\n130\n00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.860\nAnd then, let's say I have\na sub topic to talk about this.\n\n131\n00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.150\nWe're going to talk about animals, and\n\n132\n00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.140\nthen under animals we're going to talk\nabout cats then dogs then horses.\n\n133\n00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:05.870\nSo if I hit Enter, I am still in that\nthe same main level list position.\n\n134\n00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.020\nCan you say that?\n\n135\n00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.860\nThe easiest way to get to your\nsub topic is to hit the Tab key.\n\n136\n00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.660\nWhen you hit the Tab key, that takes you\nin one level it indents that section and\n\n137\n00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.400\nthen you can say, yes,\nthis is going to be underneath this topic.\n\n138\n00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.500\nAnd then I could say subtopic one.\n\n139\n00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.300\nAnd then because I'm in\nthis indented list level,\n\n140\n00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.110\nwhen I hit Enter it's gonna key\nme in that same list level.\n\n141\n00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.420\nAnd then I can say sub topic.\n\n142\n00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:32.520\nIf I could type.\n\n143\n00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.030\nTwo, 23.\nAnd then if I hit Enter,\n\n144\n00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.430\nwhat if I want to go in one more time?\n\n145\n00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.690\nYou just go ahead and\n\n146\n00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.450\nhit the tab key and it keeps on bringing\nyou in then this computer sub sub one.\n\n147\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.800\nNow, how many levels do\nyou want to go down now?\n\n148\n00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.890\nIf I'm making a Power Point presentation,\nif I have this many levels,\n\n149\n00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.660\nit starts to get a little hard to read.\n\n150\n00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.650\nSo you do wanna try and stay on I\nwould say kinda the higher levels.\n\n151\n00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.890\nAs a suggestion,\nmaybe only go one level deep.\n\n152\n00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.630\nEvery PowerPoint presentation\nhas a different purpose,\n\n153\n00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.810\na different audience, and\na reason of why you're doing this.\n\n154\n00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.380\nSo you're going to have to\nkinda judge on your own\n\n155\n00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.220\nwhat this is supposed to do for you.\n\n156\n00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.470\nSomebody teaching in a high school\nis going to be different than\n\n157\n00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.120\nsomebody doing a sales pitch\nto a major corporation.\n\n158\n00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.930\nThere's going to be different\ntypes of information.\n\n159\n00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:25.670\nAnd if this is the main content\nof somebody's science experiment,\n\n160\n00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.680\nscience experiment?\n\n161\n00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.700\nScience lesson,\nthat's what I'm trying to go with.\n\n162\n00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.550\nThen you might have a lot of text and\na lot of different levels.\n\n163\n00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.410\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nundo those last two that I did.\n\n164\n00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.230\nBut to say that I am back here on sub one,\nwell, sub sub 1.\n\n165\n00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.880\nI wanna get back out.\n\n166\n00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.660\nNow, if I hit Enter I'm\nstill on that same level.\n\n167\n00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.910\nIf you can tab to get in,\nyou can shift tab to get out.\n\n168\n00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.078\nSo if I hold my shift key and then click\nmy tab, you see how I go one level out.\n\n169\n00:07:52.078 --> 00:07:53.377\nAnd if I do it again,\n\n170\n00:07:53.377 --> 00:07:57.357\nshift tab, then it takes me all\nthe way out to that main level.\n\n171\n00:07:57.357 --> 00:08:02.180\nSo that tab and shift tab is a great\nhandy way of Entering in text, so\n\n172\n00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.520\nyou don't have to go up to the ribbon and\nuse the buttons.\n\n173\n00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.840\nNow as I say that,\nlet me show you where those buttons are,\n\n174\n00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.200\nbecause maybe you don't\nwant to use the tab key.\n\n175\n00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.760\nI would highly suggest it because\nit makes it a lot easier.\n\n176\n00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.200\nAnd this is not just for PowerPoint.\n\n177\n00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.834\nThis is in pretty much anything\nwithin office that you can do, and\n\n178\n00:08:18.834 --> 00:08:21.022\nI guess I just want to say anything\n&gt;&gt; Word.\n\n179\n00:08:21.022 --> 00:08:21.683\n&gt;&gt; Word.\nYeah,\n\n180\n00:08:21.683 --> 00:08:22.324\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n181\n00:08:22.324 --> 00:08:23.745\n&gt;&gt; I'm like you can't really do it on\n\n182\n00:08:23.745 --> 00:08:26.448\nExcel, but definitely with Word and\nPowerPoint you can do that.\n\n183\n00:08:26.448 --> 00:08:30.019\nAnd even with your emails and\nthings like that.\n\n184\n00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:33.227\nSo, I'm here and let's go ahead and\nsay a main topic.\n\n185\n00:08:33.227 --> 00:08:35.290\nI think this is topic three.\n\n186\n00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:40.650\nIf I wanted to enter and then indent,\nI have on the home tab of our ribbon,\n\n187\n00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:46.170\nyou do have your indents and your, I call\nthem out dent, but that's an indent less.\n\n188\n00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:51.380\nSo I can indent and then it's going to go\nahead and move me into that sub-topic.\n\n189\n00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.880\nAnd then if I click here,\n\n190\n00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.890\nI can click the indent less with\nthe outdent button as I have named it.\n\n191\n00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:01.140\nAnd you can move around from your\ndifferent levels of your list in that way.\n\n192\n00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.230\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nkeep on adding a few more things.\n\n193\n00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.085\nWe're gonna type in more and\nthen some more stuff.\n\n194\n00:09:06.085 --> 00:09:09.230\nAnd more,\ncuz I can't think of anything else to say.\n\n195\n00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.600\nWhat should I say, Daniel?\n\n196\n00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.800\n&gt;&gt; You should start quoting Hamlet,\nthat's always fun.\n\n197\n00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nWell, help me then.\n\n198\n00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.792\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nTo be or not to be, right?\n\n199\n00:09:16.792 --> 00:09:17.321\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n200\n00:09:17.321 --> 00:09:24.287\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That one, to be or not to be.\n\n201\n00:09:24.287 --> 00:09:25.279\n&gt;&gt; And then you can break that down.\n\n202\n00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:28.152\nYou got to be and not to be,\nthey're two sections, right?\n\n203\n00:09:28.152 --> 00:09:29.650\nAnd you can spread that out.\n\n204\n00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:30.504\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot of fun.\n\n205\n00:09:30.504 --> 00:09:31.845\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is the question.\n\n206\n00:09:31.845 --> 00:09:32.453\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n207\n00:09:32.453 --> 00:09:33.088\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n208\n00:09:33.088 --> 00:09:33.588\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n209\n00:09:33.588 --> 00:09:34.787\nAnd so as you can see,\n\n210\n00:09:34.787 --> 00:09:35.984\nwhen I keep on going,\n\n211\n00:09:35.984 --> 00:09:40.378\nI don't know if you've noticed that\nthe more bullet points that I'm adding,\n\n212\n00:09:40.378 --> 00:09:45.070\nit's automatically sizing the amount of\ninformation in that place for the text.\n\n213\n00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.140\nIt's not making the place a little bigger.\n\n214\n00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.740\n&gt;&gt; It's squishing everything down.\n\n215\n00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.740\n&gt;&gt; It's auto-sizing the text.\n\n216\n00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.995\nIf I keep on going,\nmore quotes that I can't remember.\n\n217\n00:09:56.995 --> 00:09:59.910\n[LAUGH] Keeps on resizing, resizing.\n\n218\n00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.490\nAnd more quotes.\n\n219\n00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.360\n&gt;&gt; More quests.\n\n220\n00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.040\n&gt;&gt; More quests?\n\n221\n00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:04.630\nYes, there we go.\n\n222\n00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.580\nAnd it keeps on auto resizing.\n\n223\n00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.320\nNow there's a couple of things\nthat's gonna happen here.\n\n224\n00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.400\nAnd it's all about the smart tag.\n\n225\n00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.958\nI love the smart tags, because they\ncan really, really help you out.\n\n226\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:19.527\nThis little thing that's kind of, that\npopped up over here on the left hand side\n\n227\n00:10:19.527 --> 00:10:24.111\nof our placeholder, with the lines and\nthe arrows on it, this is our smart tag.\n\n228\n00:10:24.111 --> 00:10:29.670\nThese smart tags are going to pop up\nas we enter in any type of information.\n\n229\n00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:33.670\nMostly the text, but\nit will happen with different items,\n\n230\n00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.677\nmaybe like images or charts.\n\n231\n00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:37.535\nEspecially if you're copying and\npasting things.\n\n232\n00:10:37.535 --> 00:10:42.125\nSo this smart tag is going to give\nyou options to help you along,\n\n233\n00:10:42.125 --> 00:10:45.075\nto make you smarter [LAUGH].\n\n234\n00:10:45.075 --> 00:10:47.515\nIt's really PowerPoint being smart for\nyou.\n\n235\n00:10:47.515 --> 00:10:51.585\nAnd as you can see,\nautofit text to placeholder is checked on.\n\n236\n00:10:51.585 --> 00:10:53.445\nMaybe I don't want it to do that,\n\n237\n00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:57.525\nbecause it does automatically\nchange the font size of your text.\n\n238\n00:10:57.525 --> 00:11:02.480\nSo if you tell it to stop fitting the text\nto placeholder, It will stop doing that.\n\n239\n00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.660\nAnd, keep that default\nformat of the font size.\n\n240\n00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.350\nBut then, you have an overflow.\n\n241\n00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:09.720\nAnd, it doesn't fit.\n\n242\n00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.470\n&gt;&gt; Does the slide like,\n\n243\n00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.810\nif you are actually truing to present\nthis, would the slide go weird?\n\n244\n00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:14.860\nWould you miss some of the text?\n\n245\n00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.900\nOr would actually, show up and\nhave like, an odd output?\n\n246\n00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.640\n&gt;&gt; It would actually go ahead,\nand I think it just cuts it off.\n\n247\n00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.391\nSee right there.\n\n248\n00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:26.182\nSo it just cuts it off,\nit says this is my slide area and it says,\n\n249\n00:11:26.182 --> 00:11:29.002\nwell if there's something off of it,\nI'm not gonna show you.\n\n250\n00:11:29.002 --> 00:11:29.610\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n251\n00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.698\nshould have put it inside the slide if\nyou really wanted me to show it to you.\n\n252\n00:11:31.698 --> 00:11:32.499\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n253\n00:11:32.499 --> 00:11:36.080\nSo but very good question, and so\nthat's good to demonstrate there.\n\n254\n00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:41.510\nAnd I'm in presenter view over here, and\nsometimes my mouse does not want to work.\n\n255\n00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.196\nAnd where are you?\n\n256\n00:11:45.073 --> 00:11:45.641\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n257\n00:11:45.641 --> 00:11:46.536\n&gt;&gt; I can't find my mouse.\n\n258\n00:11:46.536 --> 00:11:47.186\nThere it is.\n\n259\n00:11:47.186 --> 00:11:49.705\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] On screen two.\n\n260\n00:11:49.705 --> 00:11:53.399\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there's the mouse, I found it\nover here on my presenter view, and so\n\n261\n00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:57.130\nI'm gonna go ahead and end that show,\nand get back into our slides.\n\n262\n00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.510\nBut that was a great question, Daniel.\n\n263\n00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.930\nSo we can go ahead and demonstrate.\n\n264\n00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:05.050\nWhy we might not want to have\nthis overflow on our sites.\n\n265\n00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:09.930\nBut I have a lot of things in\nthis list that I do wanna keep,\n\n266\n00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.410\nbecause it's all part of my list items.\n\n267\n00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:15.070\nBack to that smart tag,\nwhat can it do for me?\n\n268\n00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.970\nI love these options, by the way.\n\n269\n00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.457\nSplit text between two slides,\nthat's perfect.\n\n270\n00:12:19.457 --> 00:12:23.967\nJust take everything that I have here and\njust divide it across two slides,\n\n271\n00:12:23.967 --> 00:12:28.763\nthat's a great way because maybe I have\nten points that I wanna make about my list\n\n272\n00:12:28.763 --> 00:12:29.285\nitems.\n\n273\n00:12:29.285 --> 00:12:32.401\nDon't put all ten points on one side,\nbreak it across two slides and\n\n274\n00:12:32.401 --> 00:12:33.232\nput five on each.\n\n275\n00:12:33.232 --> 00:12:36.467\n&gt;&gt; That seems a little wasteful though, I\nmean that you wouldn't want to do that but\n\n276\n00:12:36.467 --> 00:12:39.226\nwith if you had small topics like this\nwould be cool to actually be able\n\n277\n00:12:39.226 --> 00:12:40.910\nto use that white space area.\n\n278\n00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.090\n&gt;&gt; You could do that too.\n\n279\n00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.070\n&gt;&gt; No, you cannot.\n\n280\n00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.040\n&gt;&gt; Yes you can, because look at one of our\noptions change to a two-column layout.\n\n281\n00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.260\n&gt;&gt; Well there you go.\n\n282\n00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you have quite a few options.\n\n283\n00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:55.460\nLike split it between two slides, go ahead\nand change the layout into two columns.\n\n284\n00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.760\nAnd then maybe go ahead and let's go ahead\nand just start continuing on a new slide.\n\n285\n00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.360\nSo let's look at these options.\n\n286\n00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.200\nSplit between two slides, perfect.\n\n287\n00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.930\nWent ahead and\nsplit between my two slides.\n\n288\n00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.070\nSo here's the first one.\n\n289\n00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.680\nAnd it kept the title, which is nice.\n\n290\n00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:14.540\nCuz this is all part of the my\nlist item main heading part.\n\n291\n00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:19.410\nAnd so it made the heading, made a new\nslide, and went ahead and divided across.\n\n292\n00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:20.960\nThank you, PowerPoint.\n\n293\n00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.653\nWhat about the other ones?\n\n294\n00:13:21.653 --> 00:13:24.326\nLet's go ahead and\nlook at change to a two column layout.\n\n295\n00:13:24.326 --> 00:13:25.560\nIs that what you were looking for, Daniel?\n\n296\n00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.770\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was looking for.\n\n297\n00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:27.820\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; I was like, yeah.\n\n298\n00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.836\nYou got this big old slide sitting there.\n\n299\n00:13:29.836 --> 00:13:32.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All this stuff trying to bleed off\n\n300\n00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:35.040\nthe page just why doesn't it\ngo to other side of it so?\n\n301\n00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.385\n&gt;&gt; Well I think-\n&gt;&gt; You have to tell it to.\n\n302\n00:13:36.385 --> 00:13:38.098\n&gt;&gt; PowerPoint was thinking ahead for you.\n\n303\n00:13:38.098 --> 00:13:38.760\n&gt;&gt; They were.\n\n304\n00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.340\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it was like I think Daniel's\ngonna want to have a two column layout.\n\n305\n00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.800\n&gt;&gt; Get out of my brain Microsoft.\n\n306\n00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.989\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we have that option,\nand we could of course go ahead and\n\n307\n00:13:46.989 --> 00:13:48.920\ncontinue on a new slide.\n\n308\n00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.610\nThe only thing with that one is\nyou do have to kinda think ahead,\n\n309\n00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.010\nbecause it did go to a new slide.\n\n310\n00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.460\nBut it didn't bring over\nany of the text with it.\n\n311\n00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.560\nSo I tend to like those other\noptions that we just did\n\n312\n00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.930\nof splitting it across the two slides or\nchange it into a two column layout.\n\n313\n00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:08.020\nSo, but it is nice that it gives us all\nof those options and those smart text and\n\n314\n00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.720\nbe really, really smart for us.\n\n315\n00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.668\nSo I'm gonna show you a few more things\nof the smart text from the help list,\n\n316\n00:14:13.668 --> 00:14:16.880\nwhen we're inputting our\ntext into our slides.\n\n317\n00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:21.120\nSo we'll stay right here on slide three\nand we will go into my list items and\n\n318\n00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:28.377\nwe'll say AutoCorrect Options,\n\n319\n00:14:28.377 --> 00:14:31.770\nclick type.\n\n320\n00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:36.240\nI tend to not to remember to\ncapitalize first letters of sentences,\n\n321\n00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.160\nbecause this auto correct\nfeature that I'm gonna show you\n\n322\n00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.680\nhas kind of almost\ntrained me to not do it.\n\n323\n00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.405\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n324\n00:14:42.405 --> 00:14:45.230\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't use this ladies and gentlemen.\n\n325\n00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:46.463\nThis is poor grammar teaching.\n\n326\n00:14:46.463 --> 00:14:48.086\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah.\n\n327\n00:14:48.086 --> 00:14:52.820\nI am not going to use the shift key to\ncapitalize the first word of my sentence.\n\n328\n00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:59.078\nAnd I'm going to say not and then as\nsoon as I am going to hit the spacebar.\n\n329\n00:14:59.078 --> 00:15:04.466\nSo you had automatically capitalize\nthat first letter of the sentence which\n\n330\n00:15:04.466 --> 00:15:09.447\nwas very handy if I forget, and\nit's kind of trained me to not do that.\n\n331\n00:15:09.447 --> 00:15:10.258\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n332\n00:15:10.258 --> 00:15:11.113\n&gt;&gt; Which is kind of a bad thing.\n\n333\n00:15:11.113 --> 00:15:14.370\nBut it is really nice if you\ndon't remember to do that.\n\n334\n00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:20.980\nSo not going to hold the shift key.\n\n335\n00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:21.730\nAnd did you see it?\n\n336\n00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:22.773\nI don't know if you caught that?\n\n337\n00:15:22.773 --> 00:15:25.758\n&gt;&gt; There's like a little blue thing that\nshowed up underneath the shift there.\n\n338\n00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:29.120\n&gt;&gt; And, when I was holding the shift key,\nI don't know how many times you do this.\n\n339\n00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:34.590\nI'll hold the shift key down for\nthe first letter, and I'll say, like,\n\n340\n00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:38.770\nHello, but you see how I held the shift\nkey too long and I kept typing?\n\n341\n00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:40.979\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So it's capitalizing the first two\n\n342\n00:15:40.979 --> 00:15:44.606\nletters of the word, because I just\nheld it down a little too long.\n\n343\n00:15:44.606 --> 00:15:49.816\nYou see as soon as I spaced off of it, it\nautomatically lower case that second later\n\n344\n00:15:49.816 --> 00:15:54.669\nfor me, because that is a commonly done\nmistake if you wanna say for people.\n\n345\n00:15:54.669 --> 00:15:58.114\nAnd PowerPoint and Office rolled\nout together is smart enough to\n\n346\n00:15:58.114 --> 00:16:00.742\ndetect that and\nstart correcting things for me.\n\n347\n00:16:00.742 --> 00:16:02.650\nAnd that blue little thing came up,\ndidn't it?\n\n348\n00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.886\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yes That's that smart tag again.\n\n349\n00:16:04.886 --> 00:16:08.492\n&gt;&gt; That's very ingenious, because,\nI mean, I think we've probably all,\n\n350\n00:16:08.492 --> 00:16:11.370\nhopefully, if you've worked\non a computer before.\n\n351\n00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.350\nYou've typed things in,\n\n352\n00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:16.570\nand some type of AutoCorrect feature\nis on just about everything nowadays.\n\n353\n00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.130\nBut they don't have that.\n\n354\n00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.820\nCuz I do two or\nthree capital letters all the time.\n\n355\n00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.610\nCuz I get lazy with the pinkie\nfinger on the Shift key.\n\n356\n00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.630\nI let it hold on a little to long, and\nI get the first three letters capitalized.\n\n357\n00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.260\nFor it to go ahead and fix that for me,\nthat would save me a ton of typing.\n\n358\n00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:35.485\n&gt;&gt; The AutoCorrect features are great,\nthey can be really great and very helpful.\n\n359\n00:16:35.485 --> 00:16:40.150\nNow sometimes it could go in reverse\nwhere I don't want to do that,\n\n360\n00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:44.290\nbecause maybe the name\nof my company is ABc.\n\n361\n00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.440\nYou see how it keeps doing that?\n\n362\n00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.790\nAnd it's like no, no, no, stop that,\n\n363\n00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:51.670\ndon't do that,\nI want you to keep the AB capitalized.\n\n364\n00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:56.590\nWell, those little blue thingy thingies\nthat keep coming up under our words,\n\n365\n00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:00.160\nthe Smart Tags,\nit remembers that it did that for you.\n\n366\n00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.200\nSo if I came all the way back to the word\nNot and I clicked my cursor in that word,\n\n367\n00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.210\nyou see how the blue line comes up and\ngives me the option here.\n\n368\n00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:11.990\nHey, do you want me to not do\nthe AutoCorrecting that I did for you?\n\n369\n00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:15.360\nDo you want me to stop auto-capitalizing\nthe first letters of sentences?\n\n370\n00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:21.870\nDo you want me to stop automatically\ncorrecting the two capital words here?\n\n371\n00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:23.760\nNow, this is where you can pick and\nchoose.\n\n372\n00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.560\nMaybe for the ABc one,\nI would want to, no,\n\n373\n00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:32.370\ngo ahead and change it back, and\nstop automatically correcting ABc.\n\n374\n00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:36.276\nNow back on the not, but I don't want it,\ncome over here, there you go [LAUGH].\n\n375\n00:17:36.276 --> 00:17:39.380\nI don't want it to stop\nautomatically capitalizing\n\n376\n00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.680\nevery single time that I do first words\nof sentences, maybe just this once.\n\n377\n00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:49.240\nYou have the options of just this time,\nall the time, and then if you see,\n\n378\n00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:54.140\nyou could go into the central place of\nwhere all these AutoCorrect options live.\n\n379\n00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.610\nAnd you could start\ncustomizing those from there.\n\n380\n00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.120\nSo very, very handy.\n\n381\n00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:05.010\nSo maybe I wanted the ABc, let's click\non the ABc, and I wanted to stop that.\n\n382\n00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:06.770\nStop automatically correcting that,\n\n383\n00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:10.070\nbecause that is the name of my company,\nand it will start remembering.\n\n384\n00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:14.920\nIf you go on to the next line, it will\nsay all right, so if I come back here and\n\n385\n00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.441\nsay ABc.\n\n386\n00:18:15.441 --> 00:18:17.725\nIt's not automatically gonna do it,\n\n387\n00:18:17.725 --> 00:18:22.535\nbecause I've already told it don't do that\nand it remembers, which is fantastic.\n\n388\n00:18:22.535 --> 00:18:25.275\nSome other things that it will\ndo with AutoCorrect options,\n\n389\n00:18:25.275 --> 00:18:30.655\nit will automatically put in\napostrophes for contractions.\n\n390\n00:18:30.655 --> 00:18:33.775\nLike if I typed in don't, see?\n\n391\n00:18:33.775 --> 00:18:36.765\nI didn't put the apostrophe, it put\nit in there for me automatically and\n\n392\n00:18:36.765 --> 00:18:39.800\nit capitalized the first\nword of my sentence.\n\n393\n00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:45.430\nIf I type in ordinals,ordinals would be\nthings like if I typed in first or second.\n\n394\n00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.590\nThose are what are known in typography as\nordinals, where you have that superscript\n\n395\n00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.770\non the first, second, third,\nthose types of things.\n\n396\n00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.080\nIt's gonna automatically do things for\nthat.\n\n397\n00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.210\nIt will automatically correct\ncommonly misspelled words.\n\n398\n00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:02.510\nIf I type in hte, and I have to really\nthink about this when I'm typing,\n\n399\n00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.050\nand you're like, well,\nit didn't do anything.\n\n400\n00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:06.580\nYou have to space off of it.\n\n401\n00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:11.330\nYou have to say, I'm done with this word\nfor it to start doing all of its magic\n\n402\n00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:15.500\nof correcting the,\nautomatically capitalizing it.\n\n403\n00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:20.220\nAnd if I start saying, program,\nwell, it didn't fix it.\n\n404\n00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:24.384\nThat's okay,\nI did that on purpose, does well-\n\n405\n00:19:24.384 --> 00:19:25.150\n&gt;&gt; There it goes.\n\n406\n00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.440\n&gt;&gt; There, yes, it did the red squigglies.\n\n407\n00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.620\nWhat does the red squigglies mean?\n\n408\n00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.700\n&gt;&gt; It means it's misspelled.\n\n409\n00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.640\n&gt;&gt; Mm, it does, we have a misspelled word.\n\n410\n00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:36.722\nSo the program does change for\n\n411\n00:19:36.722 --> 00:19:42.014\nme, and I typed that in wrong.\n\n412\n00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:43.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's going real crazy.\n\n413\n00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.530\nIt's thinking this is\na hillbilly in front of me.\n\n414\n00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:49.190\nGonna go all the way to third\ngrade at least [LAUGH].\n\n415\n00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:54.210\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\ntrying to demonstrate here that it will\n\n416\n00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:58.190\ngive me the spelling mistakes for,\nokay, program is misspelled.\n\n417\n00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.730\nIt automatically corrected The H-T-E.\n\n418\n00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:06.550\nI meant to say does, but\nD-O-S-E, dose, it's a word.\n\n419\n00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:07.690\n&gt;&gt; That's a real word, yeah.\n\n420\n00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:11.250\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, but for, fur-\n&gt;&gt; Fur is a real word.\n\n421\n00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.130\n&gt;&gt; What is the purpose of this lesson?\n\n422\n00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:19.180\nYou need to proof, you need to always\nread back and double check your work.\n\n423\n00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:23.020\nDon't let the program do all\nof the thinking for you.\n\n424\n00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:28.000\nYou do have to make sure is\nthat the correct placement or\n\n425\n00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.160\nspelling of the word, cuz does and\ndose are two real words.\n\n426\n00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.590\nBut it does like to give\nyou the misspelling.\n\n427\n00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:40.700\nAnd from here, I like to go ahead and\njust show you how you can correct that.\n\n428\n00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.460\nI like to just right-click on it, and\nwhen you right-click on a misspelled word,\n\n429\n00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.450\nit usually will give you\nthe corrections right there or\n\n430\n00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:49.870\nthe suggestions of how you\ncould correct that word.\n\n431\n00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.896\nNow, if you spell is so\nwrong that you don't get the correction,\n\n432\n00:20:52.896 --> 00:20:53.673\nwhich I do a lot.\n\n433\n00:20:53.673 --> 00:20:57.982\nThen you're like, okay,\nmaybe Google will help us out [LAUGH].\n\n434\n00:20:57.982 --> 00:20:59.580\n&gt;&gt; Did you mean [LAUGH].\n\n435\n00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.740\n&gt;&gt; And so I can right-click right here and\ngo ahead and change any misspelled words.\n\n436\n00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:09.050\nNow, that does not mean you can't run\nan entire spellcheck, and that's always\n\n437\n00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:12.890\na good thing to do, especially when you're\ngetting ready to prepare a presentation.\n\n438\n00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.360\nRun the spellcheck on\nthe entire presentation and\n\n439\n00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.732\ngo through each part of it.\n\n440\n00:21:16.732 --> 00:21:18.660\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, this is a pet peeve of mine.\n\n441\n00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.120\nAnd I don't know,\nmaybe I'm not the only one out there, but\n\n442\n00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:26.020\nsometimes there are words that are not,\nthe program sees it as a misspelling or\n\n443\n00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.490\nit doesn't know what it is.\n\n444\n00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.260\nSo it gives me the little red squigglies,\nbut\n\n445\n00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.075\nit's actually a correctly spelled word,\nproper name.\n\n446\n00:21:32.075 --> 00:21:35.570\nYour name, for example, is one of them,\nI'm sure you've encountered this.\n\n447\n00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.400\nYou type your name, and it says,\nno that's spelled wrong,\n\n448\n00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.940\nit's V-O-N, or V-A-U-G-H-N,\nor something like that.\n\n449\n00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.340\nAnd you're like, no, it's V-O-N-N-E.\n\n450\n00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.806\nHow do I make it stop saying\nthis is spelled wrong,\n\n451\n00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:48.583\ntell it this is a correct spelling?\n\n452\n00:21:48.583 --> 00:21:49.692\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is the story of my life.\n\n453\n00:21:49.692 --> 00:21:51.843\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What is your name?\n\n454\n00:21:51.843 --> 00:21:55.815\nYeah, correct, I want it to remember.\n\n455\n00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:59.580\nFor this example, ABc,\nthat is my company name, ITProTV.\n\n456\n00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:04.447\nVonne, those are the names that you need\nto not recognize as being misspelled,\n\n457\n00:22:04.447 --> 00:22:06.930\nyou can always add it to the dictionary.\n\n458\n00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.580\nAnd this dictionary will go ahead and\n\n459\n00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.990\ngo through your entire Office system and\nit will remember.\n\n460\n00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.560\nAnd that way you can\nstart adding terms that\n\n461\n00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.730\nyou want it to know this\nis spelled correctly.\n\n462\n00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:22.240\nAnd on that right-clicking, lets just go\nahead and do it here, the right-clicking\n\n463\n00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:28.210\nin the options Add to Dictionary, it will\nallow you to do that, and there you go.\n\n464\n00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:28.720\nVery lovely.\n\n465\n00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.917\n&gt;&gt; All right, well thank you so much\nVonne, because that kind of thing annoys\n\n466\n00:22:31.917 --> 00:22:34.162\nthe mess out of me, and\nnow I know how to get rid of it.\n\n467\n00:22:34.162 --> 00:22:39.190\nIt annoys me, that the little stupid\nred line that is at a correct spelling.\n\n468\n00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.630\nAnd speaking of spelling and\ntext and things of that nature,\n\n469\n00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:44.720\nI remember in a previous episode,\nwhen you were in the presenter mode,\n\n470\n00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.020\nwe were looking at that presenter\nmode that you had up on the screen.\n\n471\n00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:51.042\nThere was speaker notes, the text that was\nin there, and it looked like notes that\n\n472\n00:22:51.042 --> 00:22:54.700\nyou had created for yourself, obviously\nthat's some sort of adding text as well.\n\n473\n00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.590\nHow is that I can do that?\n\n474\n00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.250\n&gt;&gt; The nice thing is\nthat PowerPoint tells us.\n\n475\n00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.556\nLook right down there,\nit says Click to Add Notes.\n\n476\n00:23:01.556 --> 00:23:02.960\n&gt;&gt; My goodness, it's that easy.\n\n477\n00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is that easy.\n\n478\n00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.690\nNow, I'm gonna make this a little bit\nbigger by putting the mouse in between\n\n479\n00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.040\nthe slide area and the speaker notes.\n\n480\n00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.940\nAnd get the resizing\n\n481\n00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.930\nicon to be able to make this a little\nbit better to Click to Add Notes.\n\n482\n00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.440\nAnd one small note on the notes,\n\n483\n00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.310\nif you don't see this, you might need to\ncome down here to your status bar and\n\n484\n00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:26.220\nbe able to show the notes,\ncuz they might be hiding.\n\n485\n00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.120\nAnd I think sometimes when you do\na new PowerPoint presentation it\n\n486\n00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.660\nmight do that be default.\n\n487\n00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:34.385\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nclick the Add Notes And we can click and\n\n488\n00:23:34.385 --> 00:23:36.574\nwe can start adding our notes in here.\n\n489\n00:23:36.574 --> 00:23:39.912\nAnd we can do some of the formattings\nthat we had done before,\n\n490\n00:23:39.912 --> 00:23:41.880\nlike when we did the bulleted list.\n\n491\n00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:46.780\nNow, you will have to make it\ngo into the bulleted list mode.\n\n492\n00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.834\nI'm jumping slightly ahead\ninto formatting your text.\n\n493\n00:23:48.834 --> 00:23:53.359\nBut if I go back to home and I click the\nBullets button right there, it will add\n\n494\n00:23:53.359 --> 00:23:57.773\nthe bullet just like I had on my slide and\nI can start making my points here.\n\n495\n00:23:57.773 --> 00:24:02.496\nAnd then using that tab, And\nthat shift tab to come back out.\n\n496\n00:24:02.496 --> 00:24:06.210\nAnd I can make little points for me.\n\n497\n00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:09.430\nCuz maybe I wanna expand\nout some of these topics.\n\n498\n00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.440\nBut I don't want to put it on the slide.\n\n499\n00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.880\nBecause I am the speaker.\n\n500\n00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.470\nI need to go ahead and\nexplain that information.\n\n501\n00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:19.150\nI don't want people necessarily reading\nall of the content on the slide.\n\n502\n00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:22.090\nSo you can add text\ninto the speaker notes.\n\n503\n00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:23.930\nYou can add text into the slide.\n\n504\n00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:27.800\nAnd the last one that I want to show you\nis how you could add text into slides.\n\n505\n00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:33.230\nMaybe you don't have a content\nplaceholder for you to add text into.\n\n506\n00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:38.010\nBecause one of our layouts we have\nis a blank layout or a title only.\n\n507\n00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.420\nI'm gonna go with the blank layout first,\n\n508\n00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.530\nso how am I supposed to\nget text into this slide?\n\n509\n00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:43.590\nCuz maybe I wanna freeform it.\n\n510\n00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:45.990\nI wanna put like,\nmaybe one text block over here and\n\n511\n00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:47.050\nanother text block over there.\n\n512\n00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:53.153\nI don't want to be constrained to only\nwhere the placeholders tell me to go.\n\n513\n00:24:53.153 --> 00:24:56.185\nYou can insert a text box.\n\n514\n00:24:56.185 --> 00:24:59.637\nAnd if I click here, it does give me\nthe nice little icon with the A on it,\n\n515\n00:24:59.637 --> 00:25:02.227\nto let me know that hey,\nif you go ahead and draw a box,\n\n516\n00:25:02.227 --> 00:25:04.151\nthat means I can click, hold and drag.\n\n517\n00:25:04.151 --> 00:25:09.821\nAnd draw a text box, and\nthen it puts my flashing cursor into it,\n\n518\n00:25:09.821 --> 00:25:13.635\nand then I can start typing and\nadd my text.\n\n519\n00:25:13.635 --> 00:25:17.130\nNow notice, it does go ahead,\nand I made the box a lot bigger.\n\n520\n00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:19.310\nBut it automatically changed\nthe size of the box or\n\n521\n00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:23.870\nat least the height of the box to\nthe amount of space that I'm typing in.\n\n522\n00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:28.890\nAnd this is where you would need to hit\nyour Enter key and add more text and\n\n523\n00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:30.440\nyou can do all the different things.\n\n524\n00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.987\nYou can still tab and\nchange your spacing and I'm just doing my.\n\n525\n00:25:34.987 --> 00:25:36.260\nLook at how fast I'm typing.\n\n526\n00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.601\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n527\n00:25:37.601 --> 00:25:39.639\n&gt;&gt; It's like 120 words a minute.\n\n528\n00:25:39.639 --> 00:25:41.450\n&gt;&gt; I would pass that test so great.\n\n529\n00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:46.440\nAnd so you can add your text into your\ntext box and this becomes an object.\n\n530\n00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.350\nJust like any other object that we're\ngoing to have in our slides, and\n\n531\n00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:51.310\nwe can move it around.\n\n532\n00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:55.347\nAnd you can start formatting it and\nselect the text like so.\n\n533\n00:25:55.347 --> 00:25:56.634\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n534\n00:25:56.634 --> 00:26:00.371\n&gt;&gt; So we've been adding text into our\ndocument, all the different places you can\n\n535\n00:26:00.371 --> 00:26:03.555\ndo it in our slides or in our speaker\nnotes or even in the text boxes.\n\n536\n00:26:03.555 --> 00:26:07.135\nBut I have a lot more to show\nyou with working with text.\n\n537\n00:26:07.135 --> 00:26:09.645\nWe're gonna start getting\ninto selecting text.\n\n538\n00:26:09.645 --> 00:26:11.455\nAnd we're going to cut, copy, and paste.\n\n539\n00:26:11.455 --> 00:26:13.775\nBut I feel like you're giving\nme that eye over there.\n\n540\n00:26:13.775 --> 00:26:16.744\nI think it's time wrap this up,\nisn't that right?\n\n541\n00:26:16.744 --> 00:26:18.408\n[LAUGH] I think you\nare giving me that look!\n\n542\n00:26:18.408 --> 00:26:19.589\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is time, yes.\n\n543\n00:26:19.589 --> 00:26:24.362\nWe are out of time for this episode, and\nVonne does have a lot more to show us.\n\n544\n00:26:24.362 --> 00:26:26.292\nBut the good news is,\nwe can just create a part two.\n\n545\n00:26:26.292 --> 00:26:29.275\nSo join us, good people for that part two.\n\n546\n00:26:29.275 --> 00:26:31.990\nVonne thanks so much for\njoining us today and getting us this far.\n\n547\n00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:36.040\nWe've got plenty more to go so don't miss\nthat part two, it's going to be awesome,\n\n548\n00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.280\nlife changing.\n\n549\n00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.760\nI know I'm looking forward to it.\n\n550\n00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.130\nAll right,\nwe're having too much fun today.\n\n551\n00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:43.110\nThanks for joining us everyone we're going\nto go ahead and sign off for ITPRO.TV.\n\n552\n00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.637\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n553\n00:26:44.637 --> 00:26:45.500\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n554\n00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.897\nWe'll see you next time.\n\n555\n00:26:46.897 --> 00:26:52.895\n[MUSIC]\n\n556\n00:26:52.895 -->

00:00:12.000\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.832\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.832 --> 00:00:16.588\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.588 --> 00:00:20.693\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in\ntoday's episode, we are coming back with,\n\n7\n00:00:20.693 --> 00:00:23.217\nobviously, more PowerPoint 2016 for Mac.\n\n8\n00:00:23.217 --> 00:00:26.260\nActually, continuing a conversation\non working with text.\n\n9\n00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.560\nThis is our part two of\nthat lovely little series.\n\n10\n00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.322\nAnd joining us back in the studio yet\n\n11\n00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:34.155\nagain to help further that conversation\nour good friend, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n12\n00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:35.580\nVonne, welcome back my friend.\n\n13\n00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.407\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n14\n00:00:36.407 --> 00:00:40.916\nI'm ready to continue on with working with\nour text because we learned how to type\n\n15\n00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:42.970\ntext into a slide.\n\n16\n00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.680\nBut what about if I wanted to take\nsome text out of one slide and\n\n17\n00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.370\nput it into another?\n\n18\n00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.140\nOr maybe I already have it\ntyped in somewhere else.\n\n19\n00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.710\nMaybe I have it in a Word\ndocument because I might not be\n\n20\n00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.750\nthe sole creator of\nthe content in a presentation.\n\n21\n00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.574\nMaybe you've given me\na bunch of information.\n\n22\n00:00:59.574 --> 00:01:00.658\n&gt;&gt; We could be collaborating.\n\n23\n00:01:00.658 --> 00:01:04.105\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you gave me text documents that\nsay okay, well now I wanna go ahead and\n\n24\n00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:06.149\nmake this into a Power Point presentation.\n\n25\n00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.661\nCuz I don't know, maybe you don't\nknow how to use Power Point and I do.\n\n26\n00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:09.404\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n27\n00:01:09.404 --> 00:01:10.890\nYou're the Power Point Queen.\n\n28\n00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.108\nI'm over here Power Point destitute.\n\n29\n00:01:13.108 --> 00:01:14.678\nI'm like I need your help.\n\n30\n00:01:14.678 --> 00:01:17.543\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\njust give me all the information you want.\n\n31\n00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:18.973\nI'll put it together and\nmake it look pretty.\n\n32\n00:01:18.973 --> 00:01:19.870\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n33\n00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.577\n&gt;&gt; So yeah.\nSo but before we can get into getting it\n\n34\n00:01:22.577 --> 00:01:26.861\nfrom like a Word document or\nmaybe from a website, we really should\n\n35\n00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:31.392\ngo over how to select text because\nyou always need to select to affect.\n\n36\n00:01:31.392 --> 00:01:33.587\nYou gotta make sure you\nget what you want so\n\n37\n00:01:33.587 --> 00:01:37.367\nhaving the proper selection techniques\nis going to be very important.\n\n38\n00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:43.723\nSo let's jump into a file that I\nhave properly named Select Text.\n\n39\n00:01:43.723 --> 00:01:47.969\nAnd it has a few slides, it has a bulleted\nlist here, it has some paragraphs, and\n\n40\n00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.298\nit actually has a slide here that is going\nto talk about the selection techniques.\n\n41\n00:01:52.298 --> 00:01:54.265\nHow may I get what I want?\n\n42\n00:01:54.265 --> 00:01:57.371\nThe first way is to click,\nhold and drag with your mouse.\n\n43\n00:01:57.371 --> 00:01:59.957\nSo I'm gonna actually,\nlet's close these notes so\n\n44\n00:01:59.957 --> 00:02:01.787\nyou could see us a little bit better.\n\n45\n00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:03.393\nMaybe zoom that slide in.\n\n46\n00:02:03.393 --> 00:02:05.714\nGet just the text are is just\na little too small for me.\n\n47\n00:02:05.714 --> 00:02:08.300\nIf I wanna click hold and\ndrag you also have to have your I Beam.\n\n48\n00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.796\nSo if I take my I Beam and\nI click hold and\n\n49\n00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:15.242\ndrag I can then control how much text\ndo I want to get with the mouse and\n\n50\n00:02:15.242 --> 00:02:18.470\nmaybe I get to right about there and\nthen I let go.\n\n51\n00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.292\nAnd I've got that part.\n\n52\n00:02:19.292 --> 00:02:22.734\nNow, this is something that I\nalways tell people to watch out for\n\n53\n00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:26.302\nis make sure that if you didn't get\nit the right way the first time,\n\n54\n00:02:26.302 --> 00:02:30.352\nit's like, I really wanted to go all\nthe way to select the word mouse.\n\n55\n00:02:30.352 --> 00:02:34.971\nA common thing that people do is\nthey try to extend the selection\n\n56\n00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:39.950\ntechnique with your mouse cursor and\nthen it does this weird thing.\n\n57\n00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.843\nAnd it does the,\nit does it what we call drag and drop.\n\n58\n00:02:42.843 --> 00:02:45.769\nSo people come within\nthe already selected area.\n\n59\n00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.540\nThey start dragging this way and then\nthey, I don't know what's going on and\n\n60\n00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.330\nthey let go and\nthey're like what just happened?\n\n61\n00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.810\nVery common mistake that people do\nbecause this is, it could be a good and\n\n62\n00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.410\na bad thing.\n\n63\n00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.040\nTo me it's a bad thing,\ncuz it kinda throws me off.\n\n64\n00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.870\nBut what Office does is it enables\nthe drag and drop editing.\n\n65\n00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.349\nIf I wanted to move the selected\ntext into a different space I could\n\n66\n00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.555\njust take that and move it down.\n\n67\n00:03:11.555 --> 00:03:16.384\nThe problem is is that it can kinda\nmess up with I really just wanted to\n\n68\n00:03:16.384 --> 00:03:18.230\nreselect that text.\n\n69\n00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.619\nSo be careful about that.\n\n70\n00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.580\nMy suggestion is, if you get it to\nwhere you select something here and\n\n71\n00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.010\nyou wanted to get more, just what I said,\nyou didn't do first time, start over.\n\n72\n00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.600\nClick off to a blank area,\nde-select that text.\n\n73\n00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.334\nCome back and go again and get all the\ntext that you want rather than trying to\n\n74\n00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:41.584\nkind of go over the text\nthat was already selected.\n\n75\n00:03:41.584 --> 00:03:43.912\nBecause if you're over here,\nyou don't get an I beam.\n\n76\n00:03:43.912 --> 00:03:47.416\nYou have to have an I beam\nif you're selecting text.\n\n77\n00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:52.880\nSo really small, but important to make\nsure that you know where you're going.\n\n78\n00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.650\nSo selecting with your mouse\nis one way to do that.\n\n79\n00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.584\nThere's some other neat little tricks\nthat you can do with selecting words and\n\n80\n00:04:00.584 --> 00:04:02.860\nor paragraphs with your mouse.\n\n81\n00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.504\nIf you double-click on the word,\nword, it will select that word.\n\n82\n00:04:07.504 --> 00:04:10.844\nDouble-click on the word, arrows,\nit selects that one word.\n\n83\n00:04:10.844 --> 00:04:16.031\nIf l wanted to select the entire\nparagraph, you can triple click 123,\n\n84\n00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:20.736\n123 and then it will go ahead and\nselect that entire paragraph.\n\n85\n00:04:20.736 --> 00:04:26.517\nAnd essentially well that's not really\na paragraph, it's just one line, well,\n\n86\n00:04:26.517 --> 00:04:32.147\nbecause you hit the enter key after this\nline, you are creating a new paragraph.\n\n87\n00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:34.812\nAnd so\nthat's what it's seeing as a paragraph.\n\n88\n00:04:34.812 --> 00:04:38.577\nIf I come over here to slide three,\nthis is probably what we would think in\n\n89\n00:04:38.577 --> 00:04:41.259\nthe normal terms of,\nwell, that's a paragraph.\n\n90\n00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.056\nIt's many words together.\n\n91\n00:04:43.056 --> 00:04:44.030\nIt does the same thing.\n\n92\n00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.837\n123, it goes ahead and selects that\nparagraph and you can kind of,\n\n93\n00:04:48.837 --> 00:04:53.656\njust like it's a quicker way of doing\nthings which I always like to do.\n\n94\n00:04:53.656 --> 00:04:55.768\nLet me go back to slide two cuz there's,\n\n95\n00:04:55.768 --> 00:04:59.075\nwe're talking about all these\ndifferent ways with our mouse.\n\n96\n00:04:59.075 --> 00:05:03.783\nLike we have the mouse, we click hold and\ndrag and that's great but using your\n\n97\n00:05:03.783 --> 00:05:08.590\nkeyboard can really help and I'm\na keyboard person so I like to use that.\n\n98\n00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.690\nIf I have my cursor here but you do have\nto kinda start where the flashing cursor\n\n99\n00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.850\nneeds to be at, so you do have to use\nyour mouse in some parts of that.\n\n100\n00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.851\nIf I wanted to select this word,\nI can hold my Shift key down.\n\n101\n00:05:21.851 --> 00:05:25.975\nIf you hold the Shift key down and then\nyou use your arrow keys on your keyboard,\n\n102\n00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:27.390\nI can one, two, three.\n\n103\n00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.450\nI can click with that right\narrow to go ahead and\n\n104\n00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.120\nselect those particular characters and\nI can click, click, click, click,\n\n105\n00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.620\nclick all the way to the end and\nthen I can select that text.\n\n106\n00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.760\nBack where we are saying like where\nI kinda half selected a word.\n\n107\n00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.547\nThis is where you can use it together\nwhere I click hold and drag.\n\n108\n00:05:45.547 --> 00:05:48.519\nGet a selection started,\nI just want to get a little bit more.\n\n109\n00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:52.351\nHold that Shift key down,\nuse those arrow keys on your keyboard, and\n\n110\n00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:56.910\nyou can get just those little bits of text\nthat you might have missed from selecting\n\n111\n00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:57.921\nwith your mouse.\n\n112\n00:05:57.921 --> 00:05:59.408\nSo it's not one or the other.\n\n113\n00:05:59.408 --> 00:06:01.830\nYou can do it all together.\n\n114\n00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.312\nIt's all about selecting, so whichever\nway is going to be easiest for you,\n\n115\n00:06:06.312 --> 00:06:08.100\nyou go with it.\n\n116\n00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.350\nThere are a few other little\nshortcuts here that you can do in Mac\n\n117\n00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.760\nwith selecting text.\n\n118\n00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.146\nI'm holding the Shift key down.\n\n119\n00:06:15.146 --> 00:06:17.560\nUsing the arrow key it's\ngonna go by character.\n\n120\n00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.285\nBut what if I wanted to go by word?\n\n121\n00:06:19.285 --> 00:06:23.754\nIf you wanted to go by word, you can\nhold your ALT key down or option really.\n\n122\n00:06:23.754 --> 00:06:28.232\nIt's Opt or Alt, and I hit the arrow,\nand you see how it goes 1, 2, 3,\n\n123\n00:06:28.232 --> 00:06:30.712\nit goes by word instead of by character.\n\n124\n00:06:30.712 --> 00:06:34.740\nSo that can make it a little quicker for\nyou, make it a little easier to go with.\n\n125\n00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.031\nIf you make too much of a selection,\n\n126\n00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:42.593\ncuz maybe I only wanted to have\nthe queens, and not the last word there,\n\n127\n00:06:42.593 --> 00:06:47.255\nI wanna go ahead and keeping my keys\nheld down I can use my left arrow keys.\n\n128\n00:06:47.255 --> 00:06:48.423\nSo you can expand or\n\n129\n00:06:48.423 --> 00:06:53.120\ncontract if you wanna say\nthe selections with using the keyboard.\n\n130\n00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.370\nI like it, it gives us a little bit more\ncontrol than using the mouse sometimes so-\n\n131\n00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.399\n&gt;&gt; I'll be honest,\n\n132\n00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:00.360\nI've worked a lot with\ntext editing stuff before.\n\n133\n00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.120\nI did not know this, I had no idea.\n\n134\n00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.938\nI mean, no, none of this.\n\n135\n00:07:04.938 --> 00:07:08.491\nThe Shift+T with the arrows, or\nthe up and down or left and right,\n\n136\n00:07:08.491 --> 00:07:10.200\nhad no idea that this did this.\n\n137\n00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.316\n&gt;&gt; Well, I have a few more for you.\n\n138\n00:07:11.316 --> 00:07:12.729\n&gt;&gt; My goodness.\nWell, wait, there's more.\n\n139\n00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:15.862\nIf you act now,\nwe'll throw in another option key, right?\n\n140\n00:07:15.862 --> 00:07:17.518\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we do have more keys.\n\n141\n00:07:17.518 --> 00:07:19.980\nSo yes, let me throw in another key for\nyou there.\n\n142\n00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.242\n&gt;&gt; And a Ginsu knife.\n\n143\n00:07:21.242 --> 00:07:23.673\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It slices and dices.\n\n144\n00:07:23.673 --> 00:07:24.582\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n145\n00:07:24.582 --> 00:07:26.181\nI have my cursor where I wanted to go.\n\n146\n00:07:26.181 --> 00:07:28.190\nI'm gonna hold my Shift key down.\n\n147\n00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.202\nIf I use my Cmd key, if I Shift+Cmd and\nthen right arrow key,\n\n148\n00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:36.866\nit goes automatically to the end of\nthe line, which it gets to the end.\n\n149\n00:07:36.866 --> 00:07:38.771\nAnd if I go back here\nover to this paragraph,\n\n150\n00:07:38.771 --> 00:07:40.841\nlet me just kinda get my\ncursor where I wanna go.\n\n151\n00:07:40.841 --> 00:07:43.930\nDo you see how it goes all\nthe way to the end of that line?\n\n152\n00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:49.447\nAnd then If I keep using my Shift and\nCmd, and then use my Up and Down arrows,\n\n153\n00:07:49.447 --> 00:07:54.981\ndo you see how wherever I'm at,\nmy cursor started here at the word having.\n\n154\n00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:59.947\nShift+Cmd+Down arrow it will go down\nto find like the end of where you\n\n155\n00:07:59.947 --> 00:08:03.999\nare At right now,\nwhich is in this content placeholder.\n\n156\n00:08:03.999 --> 00:08:07.760\nIf I was in Word, it would go all the way\ndown to the end of the Word document.\n\n157\n00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.400\nWhereas in the email, you can kinda go\nwith that way, and if I wanted to go up,\n\n158\n00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.380\nso Shift+Cmd+Up,\nthen it selects everything above that.\n\n159\n00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.540\n&gt;&gt; Man, this is gonna save me so\nmuch time, you do not even know.\n\n160\n00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.040\nCuz obviously, you have a long document or\nsomething like that,\n\n161\n00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.700\nand you wanna copy or select most of it.\n\n162\n00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:25.560\nAnd what are you doing?\n\n163\n00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.210\nYou're dragging, and\nyou're pushing the top of the thing.\n\n164\n00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.342\nYou're scrolling through the-\n&gt;&gt; And then it freaks out?\n\n165\n00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:32.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthen it goes 25 pages too far.\n\n166\n00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.130\nThis makes this a whole lot easier.\n\n167\n00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:34.657\nI thank you, Vaughn.\n\n168\n00:08:34.657 --> 00:08:35.341\nYou've changed my life.\n\n169\n00:08:35.341 --> 00:08:35.864\n&gt;&gt; Well, wonderful.\n\n170\n00:08:35.864 --> 00:08:38.905\n[LAUGH] I can add on a few more.\n\n171\n00:08:38.905 --> 00:08:40.185\nI can add a bonus one.\n\n172\n00:08:40.185 --> 00:08:43.394\nNow I'm showing you how to\nuse those selections, right.\n\n173\n00:08:43.394 --> 00:08:46.755\nSo we're using the Shift key to hold\ndown the Shift and it selects the text.\n\n174\n00:08:46.755 --> 00:08:50.054\nBut if you're just wanting to move your\narrow around, because I said your cursor\n\n175\n00:08:50.054 --> 00:08:53.395\nhas to be, your I-beam has to be in\nthis place where you wanna start.\n\n176\n00:08:53.395 --> 00:08:55.505\nWell let's jump into the slide.\n\n177\n00:08:55.505 --> 00:08:59.450\nSee this flashing cursor is right\nin front of the word having but\n\n178\n00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:02.900\nI wanna move the cursor\nto start the word once.\n\n179\n00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.800\nI could use the arrow keys, one, two,\nthree, four, but if you use that Alt key\n\n180\n00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.390\nit will jump your cursor to the-\n&gt;&gt; Word.\n\n181\n00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:14.191\n&gt;&gt; Yes by word, or\nyou can say I want to use the Cmd key, and\n\n182\n00:09:14.191 --> 00:09:18.175\nthen it takes me,\nI'm using the down arrow and up arrow.\n\n183\n00:09:18.175 --> 00:09:21.505\nI don't know if you can see\nwhere my cursor is moving.\n\n184\n00:09:21.505 --> 00:09:24.900\nSee it goes to the end of the line,\nlet me back up.\n\n185\n00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.340\nSo right there it's in\nfront of the word so.\n\n186\n00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.590\nThere's that flashing cursor right there.\n\n187\n00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.320\nI can hold my Cmd key and\nthen hit the right arrow and\n\n188\n00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.270\nit jumps all the way to\nthe end of the line.\n\n189\n00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:38.300\nSo the cursor is going to\nthe spaces that I want it to do.\n\n190\n00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.870\nIf I don't hold the Shift key,\nthen I'm just moving the cursor.\n\n191\n00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.050\nIf I hold the Shift key then\nI'm actually selecting.\n\n192\n00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.901\nYes, it comes from doing coding for\nso long, yeah.\n\n193\n00:09:47.901 --> 00:09:50.647\nIf you're a coder,\ncuz I do some of that stuff,\n\n194\n00:09:50.647 --> 00:09:53.268\nyou don't wanna take\nyour hands of the keys.\n\n195\n00:09:53.268 --> 00:09:54.141\n&gt;&gt; Hands off the keyboard, yeah.\n\n196\n00:09:54.141 --> 00:09:57.763\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but you need to move around so\nyou start finding all of those different\n\n197\n00:09:57.763 --> 00:10:00.990\ncombinations of using your arrow keys and\nyour keyboards.\n\n198\n00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.338\nIt makes your life a lot nicer.\n\n199\n00:10:02.338 --> 00:10:04.696\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I get these cool keyboard shortcuts,\n\n200\n00:10:04.696 --> 00:10:07.397\na Ginsu knife, and even a juicer, right?\n\n201\n00:10:07.397 --> 00:10:09.120\nMan, this is a bundle.\n\n202\n00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.881\nYou gotta get a jump into that.\n\n203\n00:10:10.881 --> 00:10:13.426\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.\n\n204\n00:10:13.426 --> 00:10:14.800\nAnd talking about one last one.\n\n205\n00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:20.140\nI'm not sure if this is a total bonus but\nIf I wanted to select all of the text,\n\n206\n00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:26.140\nmy cursor is in this content\nplaceholder Cmd + A for select all.\n\n207\n00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:30.970\nSelect All means, selecting all of\nthe text that I am in right now.\n\n208\n00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.662\nThat will be like if you're in Word or\nin PowerPoint, anything really,\n\n209\n00:10:34.662 --> 00:10:36.470\nCtrl + A is select all.\n\n210\n00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.520\nOne small little note on this is you\nneed to be careful about where you're\n\n211\n00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.420\nat when you do Cmd + A.\n\n212\n00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.980\nCuz I had the cursor in that\nactive content placeholder.\n\n213\n00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:50.732\nIf I was off into nowhere land, to where I\ndon't have anything selected on the slide,\n\n214\n00:10:50.732 --> 00:10:54.904\nand I did a Cmd + A here, It's going\nto select all the objects on the slide.\n\n215\n00:10:54.904 --> 00:11:00.560\nAnd in this case the title placeholder and\nthe content placeholder.\n\n216\n00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.470\nSo objects versus text\nthat I have selected.\n\n217\n00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:10.010\nSo it's back to that where is your cursor,\nwhat you have activated, and\n\n218\n00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.590\nthat's what it's going to select for you.\n\n219\n00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:13.190\n&gt;&gt; Very awesome.\n\n220\n00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.870\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne,\n\n221\n00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:18.040\nyou've been using this little catch\nphrase of yours select to affect.\n\n222\n00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.280\nWe have selected stuff.\n\n223\n00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.150\nYou have shown us many\na myriad of different ways\n\n224\n00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.220\nin which we might select text.\n\n225\n00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.640\nWhat can we affect then?\n\n226\n00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.480\nWhere do we at least start with affect?\n\n227\n00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.578\n&gt;&gt; In this episode we're going\nto do some copying and pasting.\n\n228\n00:11:30.578 --> 00:11:31.193\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n229\n00:11:31.193 --> 00:11:34.045\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so and then but\nonce we get into formatting your text.\n\n230\n00:11:34.045 --> 00:11:37.246\nLike if I wanted that text to be\nglowing purple, I think you had said.\n\n231\n00:11:37.246 --> 00:11:38.115\n&gt;&gt; I can't wait for that show.\n\n232\n00:11:38.115 --> 00:11:42.967\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You do have to select it so\nwe'd have our selection techniques.\n\n233\n00:11:42.967 --> 00:11:47.305\nWe're gonna copy and paste from one\nslide to another for our first example.\n\n234\n00:11:47.305 --> 00:11:51.450\nThen we'll jump into some other files\nwith Word and from the Internet.\n\n235\n00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:56.420\nSo let's say I'm on slide three and\nI really need to take this paragraph and\n\n236\n00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.560\nget it into slide six.\n\n237\n00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:04.770\nSelect the text and then I can copy and\nthis is where you can right-click.\n\n238\n00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:08.610\nYou can come up here to the top and\nyou can use your Copy button.\n\n239\n00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:13.140\nYou can do Cmd + C, whichever way\nyou need to get the text and copy.\n\n240\n00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.950\nNow, how is that different than cut?\n\n241\n00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.460\nWell, cut means you're gonna remove it.\n\n242\n00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.485\nI don't want it to be here.\n\n243\n00:12:18.485 --> 00:12:22.120\nCuz maybe I wanted to take one\nparagraph and put it on another slide.\n\n244\n00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.975\nOr, in this sense, I want to copy it and\nthen maybe do another example.\n\n245\n00:12:24.975 --> 00:12:31.300\nSo whatever reason you need to either\nremove it or copy it, that's up to you.\n\n246\n00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.240\nFor me, I'm gonna do a Cmd + C.\n\n247\n00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:41.010\nI'm gonna come down here into slide\nfive because I want to add a new slide.\n\n248\n00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:45.960\nI click into the area, now I'm putting\nmy cursor where I want the text to be\n\n249\n00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.720\npasted into, but I don't want that bullet.\n\n250\n00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.029\nYou can delete the bullet.\n\n251\n00:12:50.029 --> 00:12:51.980\nYou don't have to keep it there.\n\n252\n00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.757\nSo just Backspace out of it and\nyou can then paste.\n\n253\n00:12:54.757 --> 00:12:58.878\nI will right-click on this so you can\nsee this and I will take this paste and\n\n254\n00:12:58.878 --> 00:13:02.668\nit just goes ahead and pastes the text\njust from one side to another,\n\n255\n00:13:02.668 --> 00:13:04.090\njust like it was.\n\n256\n00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.350\nThere will be those wonderful\nsmart tabs that's gonna come up\n\n257\n00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.030\nbecause paste options.\n\n258\n00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.700\nFrom one slide to another without\nany formatting, I'm like, okay,\n\n259\n00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.470\nwell, that's great.\n\n260\n00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.160\nWhat other options do I need to do?\n\n261\n00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.870\nWhen we get into some other examples,\nthese are gonna be really important.\n\n262\n00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.360\nBut use the destination formatting.\n\n263\n00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:25.080\nUse whatever I am putting it into,\nuse that formatting.\n\n264\n00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.320\nOr do I wanna keep the source formatting\nor do I wanna keep the text only?\n\n265\n00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.540\nVery important options when\nyou're going from place to place,\n\n266\n00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.990\nand what you want it to keep and not keep.\n\n267\n00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:38.786\nThe best place to really demonstrate\nthis is to get it from a Word file.\n\n268\n00:13:38.786 --> 00:13:40.679\nCuz, like I said,\nyou had sent me those Word files, right?\n\n269\n00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:43.205\n&gt;&gt; I did, I worked long and hard on those.\n\n270\n00:13:43.205 --> 00:13:47.835\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you sent me a document with\nbunch of text about Alice and\n\n271\n00:13:47.835 --> 00:13:51.575\nI need to make a PowerPoint presentation\nabout Alice so I need to pick and\n\n272\n00:13:51.575 --> 00:13:54.435\nchoose the pieces that I want out of here.\n\n273\n00:13:54.435 --> 00:13:58.450\nI'm going to come down to this\nlast paragraph to show you.\n\n274\n00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.760\nThat this text is formatted differently.\n\n275\n00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.360\nThis is in a Times New Roman font and\nwhere I'm going is not Times New Roman.\n\n276\n00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.970\nThis also has some red text and\nsome purple text and things like that.\n\n277\n00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:09.666\n&gt;&gt; Glowing purple?\n\n278\n00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:14.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's bright purple so\nwe'll go with that.\n\n279\n00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.975\nWe can make it glow soon,\nI promise I will make things glow for you.\n\n280\n00:14:16.975 --> 00:14:21.262\n[LAUGH] I'm going to copy the text\nout of this Word document,\n\n281\n00:14:21.262 --> 00:14:23.677\ncome back over into PowerPoint.\n\n282\n00:14:23.677 --> 00:14:27.490\nLet's go ahead and make a blank slide\nsince I'm doing two things right here.\n\n283\n00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.102\nI don't have any text box do I?\n\n284\n00:14:29.102 --> 00:14:29.619\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n285\n00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:31.550\n&gt;&gt; So I've just blank slide.\n\n286\n00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:35.790\nIf you just paste right now, and I'm\ndoing a Cmd + V on my keyboard, it will\n\n287\n00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:41.830\nautomatically create a text box for\nyou when you don't have anything selected.\n\n288\n00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.660\nWe were using the placeholders before.\n\n289\n00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.250\nAnd I clicked in there and set it to go,\nI just want the text in here, and so\n\n290\n00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.900\nit made the text box automatically.\n\n291\n00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.830\nAnd you can see that,\nby default, it is keeping,\n\n292\n00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:56.890\nit's retaining all of that formatting\nthat it remembered in Word.\n\n293\n00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:59.180\nIf this is what you wanna keep, fantastic.\n\n294\n00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:04.190\nBut it doesn't match with what I am\ndoing in my presentation right now.\n\n295\n00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.460\nBring over those smart tags and\nyou can see that, well, I'm trying to,\n\n296\n00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:12.370\nit says that it's keeping the source\nformatting and now I've, sorry,\n\n297\n00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.210\nI went a little too fast.\n\n298\n00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.838\nLet me back up one more time,\nlet me paste it one more time.\n\n299\n00:15:16.838 --> 00:15:17.600\nThere we go.\n\n300\n00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.408\n[LAUGH] It says that it's using\nthe destination theme but\n\n301\n00:15:20.408 --> 00:15:24.330\nthe destination theme doesn't have\nanything to do with red or purple.\n\n302\n00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.570\nSo sometimes it throws you off.\n\n303\n00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.775\nIt's like wait a second, that's not right.\n\n304\n00:15:29.775 --> 00:15:32.270\nIt's using it but it's not.\n\n305\n00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:36.900\nSo sometimes you have to say no,\nmake sure that you take off everything.\n\n306\n00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:41.040\nIf I click use destination theme again,\nsee how then it takes it off.\n\n307\n00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.350\nIt does remember the bold and\nthe italics, which is fine, but\n\n308\n00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:49.230\nwhen we're talking about a theme, we're\ntalking about the colors and the fonts.\n\n309\n00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.260\nThat's my theme.\n\n310\n00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.999\nAnd I need to make sure\nthat it is using that, and\n\n311\n00:15:52.999 --> 00:15:55.340\nit's removing everything out of this.\n\n312\n00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.270\nSo sometimes you do have\nto click that option.\n\n313\n00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:01.312\nEven though it looks like\nyou're already using it, okay.\n\n314\n00:16:01.312 --> 00:16:04.322\nBut if I didn't want to keep the bold or\nitalics, or\n\n315\n00:16:04.322 --> 00:16:09.294\nany of the formatting from there, cuz it's\nkeeping all that rich text formatting,\n\n316\n00:16:09.294 --> 00:16:12.190\nthat does retain some of those things.\n\n317\n00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:15.360\nRegardless if you don't know what\nrich text formatting means or\n\n318\n00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.030\nit just doesn't look like I want to do,\njust take everything out.\n\n319\n00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:23.640\nDoing the Keep Text Only is a nice\nway to remove all of the formatting,\n\n320\n00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.450\nit's exactly what it says.\n\n321\n00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:27.310\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, could you show us that\nagain because your head was kind of\n\n322\n00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:28.401\ncovering the screen there.\n\n323\n00:16:28.401 --> 00:16:29.484\n&gt;&gt; That big old head of mine.\n\n324\n00:16:29.484 --> 00:16:31.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let me undo.\n\n325\n00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.870\nSo I just did Cmd+Z twice.\n\n326\n00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:38.740\nSo I'm back here in my paste and I realize\nI forgot that sometimes if you undo it,\n\n327\n00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.770\nit kind of takes away those smart options.\n\n328\n00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.430\nSo let's just keep on going back.\n\n329\n00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.940\n&gt;&gt; Just straight, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Now I will go ahead and paste.\n\n330\n00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:49.880\nAnd once I paste, now it gives\nme that smart options back and\n\n331\n00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.910\nI can say,\nKeep Text Only removes everything.\n\n332\n00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:58.610\nIt strips every single formatting\nthat I wanted out of there, If I use\n\n333\n00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:03.910\na destination it keeps that rich text\nformatting of remembering bold and italic.\n\n334\n00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:07.270\nBut if I wanted to keep all of the font,\nthe colors and\n\n335\n00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:11.020\neverything of where it came from,\nI can keep the source formatting.\n\n336\n00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:15.380\nAnd then it remembers the Times New Roman\nfont, the red and the purple,\n\n337\n00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.700\nand all of the other formatting.\n\n338\n00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:21.120\nSo you pick which one you\nwant to run with, and\n\n339\n00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.770\nat least it gives you the options,\nwhich I always want to have.\n\n340\n00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:27.120\nGive me the options and\nlet me decide what I want to do.\n\n341\n00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:30.334\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do love the options as well,\nit's why I'm a Linux user.\n\n342\n00:17:30.334 --> 00:17:31.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I have to tweak\n\n343\n00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.838\neverything, right.\n\n344\n00:17:32.838 --> 00:17:36.990\nAnd now, speaking of working with text,\nI wanna know.\n\n345\n00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.678\nOne of the things that people like\nto use when it comes to text and\n\n346\n00:17:39.678 --> 00:17:41.470\nworking with text, is Find and Replace.\n\n347\n00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.445\nIt's just something, like if you\nwere working with a text editor,\n\n348\n00:17:44.445 --> 00:17:46.273\nyou're working with a markdown editor,\n\n349\n00:17:46.273 --> 00:17:50.095\nsomething like that, it is ubiquitous\nthroughout any kind of text editing.\n\n350\n00:17:50.095 --> 00:17:52.298\nDo we find that here\nin PowerPoint as well?\n\n351\n00:17:52.298 --> 00:17:52.845\n&gt;&gt; Yes we do.\n&gt;&gt; Amen.\n\n352\n00:17:52.845 --> 00:17:57.371\n&gt;&gt; I have a document, cuz maybe you\nwent ahead and gave me all this text.\n\n353\n00:17:57.371 --> 00:17:58.055\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n354\n00:17:58.055 --> 00:18:00.905\nI started making my\npresentation about Alice.\n\n355\n00:18:00.905 --> 00:18:05.014\nAnd we're talking about some rabbits and\nthings like that.\n\n356\n00:18:05.014 --> 00:18:07.073\nBut Alice doesn't live here anymore.\n\n357\n00:18:07.073 --> 00:18:12.159\nOr maybe, and this could be a perfect\nexample of Alice was the boss and\n\n358\n00:18:12.159 --> 00:18:16.910\nnow the boss's name is Bob, or\nDaniel, Daniel is the boss now.\n\n359\n00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:18.392\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Promotion.\n\n360\n00:18:18.392 --> 00:18:21.302\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I had this entire presentation that\n\n361\n00:18:21.302 --> 00:18:24.570\nhas the word Alice\nthroughout the whole thing.\n\n362\n00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:30.300\nDo I want to go through and change\nevery single instance of this by hand?\n\n363\n00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:35.559\nNo, I want PowerPoint to find it for\nme, and then I can replace it.\n\n364\n00:18:35.559 --> 00:18:38.530\nSo let's jump into how this works.\n\n365\n00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:42.680\nUp here at the top, towards our title bar,\n\n366\n00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:47.060\nthere's a place where you can Search\nin presentation, that's our find.\n\n367\n00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.990\nYou do have a little drop down\nnext to it cuz we are going\n\n368\n00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.250\nto get into that advanced Find and\nReplace.\n\n369\n00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.924\nBecause the Find in this particular area,\nit's only gonna find.\n\n370\n00:18:56.924 --> 00:19:00.627\nIt's not gonna give me any other options\nbesides just I'm gonna tell you where\n\n371\n00:19:00.627 --> 00:19:01.140\nit's at.\n\n372\n00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.540\nWhich could be nice because maybe\nI was trying to find where I,\n\n373\n00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.700\nmaybe have 150 slides,\nand I need to find where\n\n374\n00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:13.050\nI mentioned you as the vice president,\nand I need to find that.\n\n375\n00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:16.850\nI don't necessarily need to replace it,\nI just need to find where it was, so\n\n376\n00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.520\nthen I can make some\ndifferent modifications.\n\n377\n00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.210\nSo that's where a find\nwould be appropriate.\n\n378\n00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.370\nSo let's go ahead and type in Alice.\n\n379\n00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:28.190\nAnd then if I hit Enter,\nit's going to say well there it is, and\n\n380\n00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:32.430\nit highlighted on slide 2\nthat there is the word Alice.\n\n381\n00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.990\nAnd then I have my forward and\nbackward buttons,\n\n382\n00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.380\nwell where's the next instance of Alice?\n\n383\n00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.950\nThere it is, and we go ahead and\nclick all the way through.\n\n384\n00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:41.130\nIt found it in the speaker notes.\n\n385\n00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.889\nSo that's a nice thing that it's\nsearching the entire presentation.\n\n386\n00:19:43.889 --> 00:19:48.180\nIt's not just searching your slides,\nit will search your speaker notes.\n\n387\n00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.644\nAnd I can keep on moving through and\nit shows me.\n\n388\n00:19:50.644 --> 00:19:53.830\nI think I've looped a couple of times,\nno, there I am.\n\n389\n00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.430\nNow it says I finished searching\nthe presentation, thank you very much.\n\n390\n00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.900\nAnd I did exactly what you told me to do.\n\n391\n00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.960\nBut this is where what if I wanted\nto replace Alice with Daniel.\n\n392\n00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:08.610\nDrop that down and\nI can go into either the Advanced Find or\n\n393\n00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.750\nthe Replace, either one is going to work.\n\n394\n00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:15.950\nBecause once I get into Advanced Find\nthere is a button here for replace,\n\n395\n00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:21.762\nand once I click Replace, then it gives\nme that option of Find what replace with.\n\n396\n00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:26.108\nAnd sometimes I usually just jump right\nto this dialog box to begin with,\n\n397\n00:20:26.108 --> 00:20:29.030\nbecause most of the time I am replacing.\n\n398\n00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:29.947\nAnd so I'm gonna-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n399\n00:20:29.947 --> 00:20:31.610\nobviously you've got\na couple of options there.\n\n400\n00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.460\nOne says Replace,\nthe other says Replace all.\n\n401\n00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:38.150\nSo I assume one does one instance and\nthe other does all instance.\n\n402\n00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:42.970\n&gt;&gt; Correct, because maybe there\nare places in there where I want to keep\n\n403\n00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:47.100\nthe word Alice because it's\nin a different context.\n\n404\n00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:52.926\nAnd it's not just saying that Alice as a\npresident, it's a Alice as just a person.\n\n405\n00:20:52.926 --> 00:20:55.788\nOr maybe there's a different Alice,\nthere's Alice Smith and\n\n406\n00:20:55.788 --> 00:20:56.873\nthere's Alice Jones.\n\n407\n00:20:56.873 --> 00:21:02.422\nAnd so we need to make sure that I can\ngo through and find each instance and\n\n408\n00:21:02.422 --> 00:21:06.910\nthen one by one say find,\nreplace, find, replace.\n\n409\n00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:12.030\nSo Find What, Replace, we've already found\nAlice, we wanna replace it with Daniel.\n\n410\n00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:16.570\nNow, point it out here,\nMatch case, Find whole words only.\n\n411\n00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:20.234\nLet's go ahead and just find the next one.\n\n412\n00:21:20.234 --> 00:21:27.130\nRight there, Alice's, you see how\nit's got that possession there.\n\n413\n00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:32.691\nIf I wanted it to replace it,\nhere that would probably be appropriate,\n\n414\n00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:36.505\nbut what if it was Alice's,\nI don't even know.\n\n415\n00:21:36.505 --> 00:21:39.244\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But there's some other letters\n\n416\n00:21:39.244 --> 00:21:42.344\nassociated with it, or maybe-\n&gt;&gt; This is like suffixes and\n\n417\n00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:45.680\nthings that might affect to\na way that you don't want.\n\n418\n00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:51.270\n&gt;&gt; Or if I was finding Dan and replace\nwith Bob but there's Daniel, right?\n\n419\n00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.710\nSo there's Dan and Daniel.\n\n420\n00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.724\nSo it would find just parts of a word.\n\n421\n00:21:55.724 --> 00:22:01.471\nSo telling it to Find whole words only,\nis something that you need to figure out,\n\n422\n00:22:01.471 --> 00:22:04.890\ndo you want it to do that or\nnot, or Match case.\n\n423\n00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:09.980\nWhat if I have, it's only gonna find\nupper case Alice, if I have Match case.\n\n424\n00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.670\nIf I don't have this checked on, it's\ngonna find a lower case Alice as well.\n\n425\n00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.492\nSo, figuring out which one you wanna do.\n&gt;&gt; Keep those in mind, right, yeah.\n\n426\n00:22:15.492 --> 00:22:19.844\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes what you have to do\nis to do a search with the Find whole\n\n427\n00:22:19.844 --> 00:22:23.263\nwords only off, go through it,\nand then all right,\n\n428\n00:22:23.263 --> 00:22:27.803\nwell now I need to do another search and\nreplace with that checked on.\n\n429\n00:22:27.803 --> 00:22:30.348\nSo sometimes you have to\ndo like multiple finds and\n\n430\n00:22:30.348 --> 00:22:33.330\nreplaces to make sure it gets\nyou exactly what you wanted.\n\n431\n00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:37.990\n&gt;&gt; Still a whole lot easier than\nrifling through each slide looking for\n\n432\n00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.700\nthe exact thing.\n\n433\n00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.170\nAnd you'll miss a few, am I right?\n\n434\n00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:44.510\nAnd then you go to present your slides and\npeople are like, Alice has been gone and,\n\n435\n00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:45.567\nwhat have you done?\n\n436\n00:22:45.567 --> 00:22:47.694\nYou know, that's bad form.\n\n437\n00:22:47.694 --> 00:22:49.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's,\n\n438\n00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.020\nagain, where the Replace and\nthe Replace all do it all for me.\n\n439\n00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.431\nSometimes you might wanna be careful about\nthat, cuz it will do things like, ooh,\n\n440\n00:22:55.431 --> 00:22:57.150\nthat was the wrong place for\nus to do that.\n\n441\n00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:01.635\n[LAUGH] So, I could go through and\nfind the next one, and this one I say,\n\n442\n00:23:01.635 --> 00:23:06.660\nyep, replace that one,\nlet's go ahead and replace this one.\n\n443\n00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:13.770\nAnd then, I think my dialogue box is\nbehind there, Replace here, Replace here.\n\n444\n00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.930\nThat's where right now,\nsince I didn't have the Match case like,\n\n445\n00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:20.620\nthis is like a different word\nall together for some reason.\n\n446\n00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:21.719\nI don't want to replace this,\n\n447\n00:23:21.719 --> 00:23:25.180\nit's like no, let's go ahead and find the\nnext one and it won't replace that one.\n\n448\n00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:28.450\n&gt;&gt; The last slide actually or\nmaybe even this one,\n\n449\n00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.160\nwas a great about the context, right?\n\n450\n00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:31.782\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n451\n00:23:31.782 --> 00:23:32.749\n&gt;&gt; The context was different,\n\n452\n00:23:32.749 --> 00:23:34.527\nit was talking about Alice\nsitting with her sister.\n\n453\n00:23:34.527 --> 00:23:36.677\nIf you change that Daniel\nsitting with her sister,\n\n454\n00:23:36.677 --> 00:23:38.430\nall of a sudden that doesn't make sense.\n\n455\n00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:40.790\nSo it's good that we were going\nthrough it one at a time.\n\n456\n00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:44.758\nInstead of going, yeah, just get rid\nof Alice and replace it with Daniel and\n\n457\n00:23:44.758 --> 00:23:47.160\nnow Daniel's like, [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n458\n00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.410\n&gt;&gt; That's not making a lot\n\n459\n00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:49.335\nof sense to me right here.\n\n460\n00:23:49.335 --> 00:23:50.899\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's another reason,\n\n461\n00:23:50.899 --> 00:23:52.070\nalways go back and proof.\n\n462\n00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.666\n&gt;&gt; Yes, proof.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, read it.\n\n463\n00:23:52.666 --> 00:23:54.719\nAnd then give it to\nsomebody else to proof.\n\n464\n00:23:54.719 --> 00:23:55.315\n&gt;&gt; And then proof their proof.\n\n465\n00:23:55.315 --> 00:23:56.925\n&gt;&gt; And then you proof again [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n466\n00:23:56.925 --> 00:23:59.148\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There was one, read up side down.\n\n467\n00:23:59.148 --> 00:24:00.134\nOr read it backwards.\n\n468\n00:24:00.134 --> 00:24:04.406\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Instead of going linear, especially for\n\n469\n00:24:04.406 --> 00:24:06.707\nchecking punctuation.\n\n470\n00:24:06.707 --> 00:24:08.130\nThat's a big one to do.\n\n471\n00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:09.766\nI would always proof\nour books upside down.\n\n472\n00:24:09.766 --> 00:24:10.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n473\n00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:14.360\n&gt;&gt; So find and replace can be\nsuper handy to get the text.\n\n474\n00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:18.050\nCuz maybe you've gotten text into it,\nyou've pasted it from other places,\n\n475\n00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:22.550\nyou've done your paste options, and\nthen you've got things that I need to fix.\n\n476\n00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:24.470\nFind and replace can be super helpful.\n\n477\n00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:27.430\nAnd those paste options\nespecially if you're copying and\n\n478\n00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:28.770\npasting from the Internet.\n\n479\n00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:30.851\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So if you went out to a website and\n\n480\n00:24:30.851 --> 00:24:35.512\nyou get everything, it can do some really\nstrange formatting in there because it's\n\n481\n00:24:35.512 --> 00:24:37.890\nusing HTML or hyper text markup language.\n\n482\n00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:41.153\nSo it might be pulling in pictures and\ntables and what you think\n\n483\n00:24:41.153 --> 00:24:45.255\nis just regular text it pastes in, you're\nlike I have no idea what I just did.\n\n484\n00:24:45.255 --> 00:24:45.815\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n485\n00:24:45.815 --> 00:24:49.136\n&gt;&gt; Or even when you go ahead and\nsay keep text only,\n\n486\n00:24:49.136 --> 00:24:53.970\nyou might be bringing in things that\nyou didn't even see on the page.\n\n487\n00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.278\nIt might be bringing in\nalt text from an image or\n\n488\n00:24:56.278 --> 00:24:58.837\njust things that you're\nmaybe not familiar with.\n\n489\n00:24:58.837 --> 00:25:01.819\nBut just kinda go through these\ndifferent paste options and\n\n490\n00:25:01.819 --> 00:25:05.250\nget it close enough to where you\ncan get what you want out of it.\n\n491\n00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:09.730\nAnd then a little trick though I've\nfound if you paste it into Notepad, or\n\n492\n00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:14.750\nsome very basic type of text program,\n\n493\n00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:18.665\nthat doesn't do the formatting\nlike Word or PowerPoint like that.\n\n494\n00:25:18.665 --> 00:25:21.365\nIt will automatically strip\neverything out of it and\n\n495\n00:25:21.365 --> 00:25:26.825\nthen you can copy from that Notepad or\nnotes and then paste it into your product.\n\n496\n00:25:26.825 --> 00:25:28.020\n&gt;&gt; So use that as a filter?\n\n497\n00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:28.865\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n498\n00:25:28.865 --> 00:25:31.085\n&gt;&gt; Let's get it the way you want\nit before you try to drop in,\n\n499\n00:25:31.085 --> 00:25:32.952\nthen have to work with\nit inside of PowerPoint.\n\n500\n00:25:32.952 --> 00:25:37.752\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, especially coming up from PDFs\ndepending on how PDFs are created from\n\n501\n00:25:37.752 --> 00:25:39.638\nwhatever offering program.\n\n502\n00:25:39.638 --> 00:25:44.853\nWhen you select it,\nit does these weird, like enter marks.\n\n503\n00:25:44.853 --> 00:25:49.670\nIf you can just get it into like a\nstripped out program that just does text,\n\n504\n00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.960\nas in some very basic text editor.\n\n505\n00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.480\nThen you can kind of\nclean it up from there,\n\n506\n00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:58.630\ntrying to go into a program\nsuch as Word or PowerPoint.\n\n507\n00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.230\nIt's almost like you're making\nmore work for yourself.\n\n508\n00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:04.370\nSo let the little guys do the work and\n\n509\n00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.990\nthen bring it into the big\nguys to do some formatting.\n\n510\n00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:07.745\n&gt;&gt; Excellent stuff.\n\n511\n00:26:07.745 --> 00:26:11.800\nVonne, you are a wealth of knowledge when\nit comes to this PowerPoint business.\n\n512\n00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.615\nI guess that's why we hired you.\n\n513\n00:26:13.615 --> 00:26:15.860\n[LAUGH] Cuz you actually\nknow how to use this thing.\n\n514\n00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.800\nSo we do appreciate you sharing that\nknowledge with us though and like I said I\n\n515\n00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.940\nlearned a lot of things today that\nI had no idea were even a thing.\n\n516\n00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.330\nAnd now we all do, we can jump in\nthere and edit work with text,\n\n517\n00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:27.000\ndo things with it.\n\n518\n00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.730\nThat's probably the majority of what we'll\nbe doing when we're modifying text, not\n\n519\n00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:35.570\nthat we won't play around with it, make\nit a little purple, it's gonna be fun.\n\n520\n00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:39.020\nBut we gotta make it look right before\nwe start adding those types of features.\n\n521\n00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.210\nSo Vonne, you've done a great job,\nthank you so much for today.\n\n522\n00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.370\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; We thank you for watching, but\n\n523\n00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:46.055\nit looks like it's that time ladies and\ngents for us to sign off.\n\n524\n00:26:46.055 --> 00:26:48.580\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n525\n00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:49.204\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n526\n00:26:49.204 --> 00:26:50.916\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n527\n00:26:50.916 --> 00:26:56.687\n[MUSIC]\n\n528\n00:26:56.687 --> 00:27:00.114\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

--> 00:00:23.660\nmore of our PowerPoint 2016 for Mac.\n\n9\n00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.531\nWell, at least hopefully\nthat's what you're here for.\n\n10\n00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:28.530\nIf you're here for basket-weaving,\nyou've come to the wrong place.\n\n11\n00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.550\nOddly enough, though,\nour host could help you out with that,\n\n12\n00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.660\nby some

going?\n\n15\n00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.150\n&gt;&gt; I'm great.\n\n16\n00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.650\n&gt;&gt; I just assume you\nknow how to basket-weave.\n\n17\n00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.810\n&gt;&gt; I did take underwater\nbasket-weaving in college.\n\n18\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.480\n&gt;&gt; There you go, see,\nwe could have done that show.\n\n19\n00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.637\n&gt;&gt; But I'm not sure, I could show\nyou how to do it not underwater.\n\n20\n00:00:45.637 --> 00:00:47.750\nSo I'm not sure if I'd be much help.\n\n21\n00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.066\n&gt;&gt; Well, you lose that skill,\nthere's no re-certify, right?\n\n22\n00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But what I can tell you all about,\n\n23\n00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.470\nis all about fonts, and all about\ncharacter and paragraph formatting.\n\n24\n00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.498\nAnd that's what we're going\nto be doing in this episode.\n\n25\n00:00:59.498 --> 00:01:05.310\nThis episode is gonna be more about\nexplaining the concepts behind typography.\n\n26\n00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.770\nAnd then, in the next episode,\nwe're going to be actually creating and\n\n27\n00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.330\napplying the formats that\nwe're gonna talk about.\n\n28\n00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.830\nBut there's just so much that I wanna\ntalk about, in the world of typography.\n\n29\n00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.110\nSo I wanted to create our own episode,\nto go through everything.\n\n30\n00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.316\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ms. Vonne, please enlighten us,\nyou've got us, our appetites' whetted.\n\n31\n00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:26.076\nDon't leave us hanging, where do we begin?\n\n32\n00:01:26.076 --> 00:01:28.716\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're gonna begin with the first\nslide in our PowerPoint presentation\n\n33\n00:01:28.716 --> 00:01:29.316\nthat I've made.\n\n34\n00:01:29.316 --> 00:01:31.852\nAbout character and paragraph formatting.\n\n35\n00:01:31.852 --> 00:01:35.261\n&gt;&gt; How apropos [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I know, so on this slide,\n\n36\n00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.477\nit's just a basic overview.\n\n37\n00:01:37.477 --> 00:01:40.458\nBecause when you're talking\nabout formatting text,\n\n38\n00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:42.990\nyou're talking about\nchanging how it looks.\n\n39\n00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.014\nWhether it be the font, the size,\nthe color, the alignment.\n\n40\n00:01:46.014 --> 00:01:49.192\nAll of those things that we\nusually lump all together,\n\n41\n00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:51.930\nas just making the text look differently.\n\n42\n00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.920\nBut when you're talking about formatting,\nyou do have two levels of formatting.\n\n43\n00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.610\nYou have character-level formatting, and\nyou have paragraph-level formatting.\n\n44\n00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.185\nAnd that's how I'm gonna\nbe referring to it.\n\n45\n00:02:02.185 --> 00:02:06.900\nIf you think about levels,\nwhat part of the words or\n\n46\n00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.202\nparagraphs are we going to be affecting?\n\n47\n00:02:09.202 --> 00:02:11.560\nAnd character-level formatting\nwould be just that.\n\n48\n00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.720\nHow the words look differently,\nand the font,\n\n49\n00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.530\nthe size, the effects,\nkerning and tracking.\n\n50\n00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.820\nAnd the wonderful Change Case button,\nthat can be very helpful for you.\n\n51\n00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.880\nAnd then you talk about paragraphs,\n\n52\n00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.120\nit's the entire paragraph,\nand what is a paragraph?\n\n53\n00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.320\nIt's anytime you hit Enter or\nthe Return key on your keyboard.\n\n54\n00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.530\nWhen you hit that Enter,\n\n55\n00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.620\nyou're making a carriage return,\nand you're making a new paragraph.\n\n56\n00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.280\nSo that could be things like\nthe bullets and numbering,\n\n57\n00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.060\nthat is a paragraph-level formatting.\n\n58\n00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.370\nAnd how you justify something,\nand when I say justify,\n\n59\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.550\na lot of times people think of it as\naligning like left, right, center.\n\n60\n00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.180\nBut in the world of typesetting,\nwe use justifies, in the same way.\n\n61\n00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.330\nSo you might hear me use that\nterminology through this.\n\n62\n00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.740\nAnd then leading and line spacing, or\nleading and space before or after,\n\n63\n00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.670\ntabs and indent and vertical alignment.\n\n64\n00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.610\nNow, these are just the things that\nare available to us in PowerPoint.\n\n65\n00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.770\nIf you get into other programs, maybe\neven Word will take it a little further.\n\n66\n00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.000\nBut then you go into other programs\nsuch as Adobe InDesign and Illustrator.\n\n67\n00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.250\nYou can take how you can\nformat text even further,\n\n68\n00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.590\ninto things with like hyphenation and\njustification.\n\n69\n00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.900\nYou can do things with swashes and\nordinals,\n\n70\n00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.510\nand we're gonna get into OpenType fonts,\nbut you know what?\n\n71\n00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.720\nWe don't have to go that\nfar in this series,\n\n72\n00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.840\ncuz we're talking about PowerPoint.\n\n73\n00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.500\nSo I just wanted to give you the things\nthat you can format in PowerPoint.\n\n74\n00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.990\nSo let's start at\nthe character-level formatting,\n\n75\n00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.749\nwhere we're going to be\nformatting our words.\n\n76\n00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.960\nWe're talking about font, the font, or\n\n77\n00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.310\nthe font face as sometimes it's called,\nthe typography.\n\n78\n00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.840\nIt's all about how the letters look.\n\n79\n00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.576\nAnd Daniel, do you remember in,\nprobably in elementary school,\n\n80\n00:03:55.576 --> 00:03:57.850\nthe lined paper that we had to write on?\n\n81\n00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.020\n&gt;&gt; I do, the college rule, or legal, or\n\n82\n00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.915\nwhatever, always had\nthe little blue lines.\n\n83\n00:04:01.915 --> 00:04:03.170\nI had to write on that line.\n\n84\n00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.550\n&gt;&gt; I'm going even further back than that.\n\n85\n00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.039\nDo you remember where you had those two-\n&gt;&gt; The big ones, yeah.\n\n86\n00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.845\n&gt;&gt; Where the dash is?\n\n87\n00:04:08.845 --> 00:04:10.680\n&gt;&gt; The red dashed line in the middle?\n\n88\n00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.390\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n89\n00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.758\nthat is way back\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n90\n00:04:12.758 --> 00:04:15.460\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and how you had to put certain\nletters below the little dashes and\n\n91\n00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.196\ncertain letters-\n&gt;&gt; And then they had the break,\n\n92\n00:04:17.196 --> 00:04:18.224\nthe blue line underneath,\n\n93\n00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:20.280\nif it was a lowercase\n&gt;&gt; The Y or something.\n\n94\n00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.780\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n95\n00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.100\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I totally remember that.\n\n96\n00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.035\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, well that's,\n\n97\n00:04:23.035 --> 00:04:27.100\nwhen you're talking about fonts and\ntypography, it reminds me of that.\n\n98\n00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.540\nBecause if you look at this slide right\nhere, in the word Typography right here.\n\n99\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.357\nHow, where all the lines, or\nwhere all the letters align up,\n\n100\n00:04:36.357 --> 00:04:39.050\nlike the tops of the P and\nthe G and the R.\n\n101\n00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.160\nThat's known as the x-height,\n\n102\n00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.520\nand that's something like when we were\nlearning how to write, that dotted line?\n\n103\n00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.159\nWhich is trying to tell us, don't put\nthe o or the a above the dotted line,\n\n104\n00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:48.770\nbecause it needs to stay there.\n\n105\n00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.420\nBut if you're writing the letter h or\nthe letter t,\n\n106\n00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.520\nthat goes all the way to the top of\nthe line, but the y goes below that line.\n\n107\n00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.030\nSo that bottom line is\nknown as the baseline,\n\n108\n00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.160\nthe baseline of where all the text sits.\n\n109\n00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.120\nAnd then,\nwhether it goes above the x-height or\n\n110\n00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.855\nbelow the baseline depends on whether\nthat is an ascender or a descender.\n\n111\n00:05:06.855 --> 00:05:08.710\nThe parts of the character, and\n\n112\n00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.420\nall of these characters actually have\nterminology that's associated with it.\n\n113\n00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.460\nLike for example,\nthat little g right there?\n\n114\n00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.580\nThis thing that's coming off the\nright-hand side, that's called its ear.\n\n115\n00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.810\nAnd then this little thing going\ndown here, that's its neck.\n\n116\n00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.270\nAnd then the part at\nthe bottom is called the loop.\n\n117\n00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.600\nAnd inside the terminal at the a, there's,\nI'm looking at my notes over here.\n\n118\n00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.270\nThe o, that's called a bowl.\n\n119\n00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.510\nThe inside part of an o is called a bowl.\n\n120\n00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.690\nAnd you have the r, there's a shoulder.\n\n121\n00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.170\nSo, I mean, we could get really, I mean,\nwe're talking about almost body parts.\n\n122\n00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.549\n&gt;&gt; We are anthropomorphizing\nthese letters very quickly.\n\n123\n00:05:44.549 --> 00:05:46.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if you think about it, I mean,\n\n124\n00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.360\nthe g, it does have a neck.\n\n125\n00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.240\nAnd the r, it does have a shoulder, right?\n\n126\n00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.350\nSo we're just using those terminology, or\n\n127\n00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.910\ndescribing how the characters look,\nwith all of these different terms.\n\n128\n00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.180\nNow do you need to know all of this?\n\n129\n00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.670\nNo, you don't, but\nthe g that is right here in typography.\n\n130\n00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.720\nThat looks different than the g,\nif this was a lowercase g.\n\n131\n00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.411\nSo it has that kind of fun\nlittle swoopy hole thing.\n\n132\n00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:15.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what we're calling it.\n\n133\n00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.910\nSo that's how I would explain myself.\n\n134\n00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.130\n&gt;&gt; That's the technical term, right?\n\n135\n00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.710\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's not a loop and a neck,\n\n136\n00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.560\nit's a\n&gt;&gt; That's a-\n\n137\n00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.940\n&gt;&gt; Swoopy whole thing, yeah.\n\n138\n00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.671\n&gt;&gt; Bold swoopy thing, yeah.\n\n139\n00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:24.895\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, but how the g's and\n\n140\n00:06:24.895 --> 00:06:27.791\nhow your a's look, how your y's look.\n\n141\n00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:34.730\nThey all look different, depending on what\nfont you are choosing to format your text.\n\n142\n00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.990\nAnd when you're talking about fonts,\n\n143\n00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.420\nyou also have something\nknown as a font family.\n\n144\n00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.880\nLike for example Arial,\nArial is a very common font.\n\n145\n00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.710\nBut within the font family of Arial,\nthere's Arial Bold,\n\n146\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.740\nthere's Arial Bold Italic.\n\n147\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.080\nSometimes there's Arial Narrow, or\nArial Condensed, or Arial Black.\n\n148\n00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.754\nSo, all of those different kind\nof versions, if you wanna say,\n\n149\n00:06:55.754 --> 00:06:59.100\nof Arial, is because they all\nbelong to that font family.\n\n150\n00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.022\nAnd certain fonts have more\nfamily members, if you wanna say,\n\n151\n00:07:03.022 --> 00:07:04.450\nthan other fonts.\n\n152\n00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.830\nFor example, Curlz MT, if you've seen it,\nthere's just Curlz MT.\n\n153\n00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.590\nThere's no other version of\nthat particular font family.\n\n154\n00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.570\nSo choosing what font you're going\nto be putting onto your site,\n\n155\n00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.500\nit really says something.\n\n156\n00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.170\nIf you wanna say, your fonts,\nit mas a meaning.\n\n157\n00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.320\nThe word meaning, here,\nversus the word personality,\n\n158\n00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.040\nversus the word convey,\nthey all say something different.\n\n159\n00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.590\nThey have a different,\nthey mean something, and\n\n160\n00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.560\nthey're expressing something.\n\n161\n00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.960\nSo, if I'm doing a PowerPoint presentation\nto elementary school children.\n\n162\n00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.750\nYou might pick a more comical font,\na little bit more playful font.\n\n163\n00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:49.100\nIf I’m doing a presentation to the board\nmembers of a large corporation.\n\n164\n00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:54.330\nYou might not use this font, or ones that\nhave little curly things and everything.\n\n165\n00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.131\nYou probably want a cleaner font, and\na nice-looking font, maybe this font.\n\n166\n00:07:58.131 --> 00:08:00.266\nMaybe Arial, Arial is a very nice font.\n\n167\n00:08:00.266 --> 00:08:03.875\nIt's really,\nit's kind of a personal preference But\n\n168\n00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:08.504\nyou also have to think of your audience,\nI don't want to put Pearls and\n\n169\n00:08:08.504 --> 00:08:13.080\nTea talking about budget numbers\nto the CEO of a large corporation.\n\n170\n00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.700\nI don't know if that would come\noff as well as maybe creating like\n\n171\n00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.760\na nice Helvetica font.\n\n172\n00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.930\nThat's a nice,\n\n173\n00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.630\ncommon font that's just kinda clean and-\n&gt;&gt; Business like.\n\n174\n00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.350\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's very business like.\n\n175\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.590\nYes.\nAnd you see Helvetica everywhere.\n\n176\n00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.080\nAlmost every street sign.\n\n177\n00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.603\nThere's a whole movie on Helvetica.\n\n178\n00:08:29.603 --> 00:08:30.649\nIt's a really awesome movie.\n\n179\n00:08:30.649 --> 00:08:32.920\n&gt;&gt; It would seem that Microsoft\nreally likes Courier, right?\n\n180\n00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:33.690\nIs that the one that they.\n\n181\n00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:34.994\n&gt;&gt; Courier?\n&gt;&gt; Is that the one that they\n\n182\n00:08:34.994 --> 00:08:36.541\ndefault to with all their office products.\n\n183\n00:08:36.541 --> 00:08:37.453\n&gt;&gt; Well actually Calibri.\n\n184\n00:08:37.453 --> 00:08:38.249\n&gt;&gt; Calibri.\n\n185\n00:08:38.249 --> 00:08:39.315\n&gt;&gt; Calibri yes.\n\n186\n00:08:39.315 --> 00:08:42.215\nCalibri is the font that and\nactually right here, see the word.\n\n187\n00:08:42.215 --> 00:08:42.905\n&gt;&gt; That's Calibri.\n\n188\n00:08:42.905 --> 00:08:43.785\n&gt;&gt; And how am I seeing that?\n\n189\n00:08:43.785 --> 00:08:46.965\nI'm actually clicking on it and seeing\nit in the font right here that this is\n\n190\n00:08:46.965 --> 00:08:49.750\nCalibri so that means [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; They created that font, right,\n\n191\n00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.958\nMicrosoft, is that their proprietary font,\nand that's why they use it?\n\n192\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.860\n&gt;&gt; Surely [CROSSTALK],\nI honestly, I have [CROSSTALK]\n\n193\n00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.293\n&gt;&gt; That's not the Gospel of Paul or\n\n194\n00:08:56.293 --> 00:08:59.190\nanything, it's just something I heard,\nit might not be true.\n\n195\n00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.650\n&gt;&gt; Well, see,\nnow you've already piqued my interest.\n\n196\n00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.800\nCuz I'm like, who does that,\nwell that actually kind of-\n\n197\n00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.500\n&gt;&gt; It is an interesting topic, yes.\n\n198\n00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:11.540\n&gt;&gt; And there are whole font foundries, as\nthey're called, of places that own fonts.\n\n199\n00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.420\nAnd you might not even think\nof it that way, but it is.\n\n200\n00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.160\n&gt;&gt; Try to publish something by using them\nwithout giving them rights, though, and\n\n201\n00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:17.900\nsee what happens.\n\n202\n00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:18.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you've\n\n203\n00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.940\ngotta be very careful about that.\n\n204\n00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.410\nAnd that's actually as designers', you,\nlike some of like the best Christmas\n\n205\n00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.860\ngifts you can get from your boss is\nlike you get a $100 to buy new fonts.\n\n206\n00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.596\nAnd she's like, yes awesome.\n\n207\n00:09:29.596 --> 00:09:31.621\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you go to the different font\n\n208\n00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:36.677\nboundaries and you can purchase groups\nof fonts that they own the rights to,\n\n209\n00:09:36.677 --> 00:09:37.790\nand they own it.\n\n210\n00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.060\nSo I wouldn't doubt if Calibri\nis a Microsoft owned font.\n\n211\n00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.050\nLike you said,\nwe're not going to claim that right now,\n\n212\n00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.770\nbecause I really want to go look\nthat up and see who owns it.\n\n213\n00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.030\nSo yes, all about topography.\n\n214\n00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.660\n&gt;&gt; That's your homework everyone.\n\n215\n00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.202\nLook it up.\nWho owns Calibri.\n\n216\n00:09:52.202 --> 00:09:55.195\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So knowing all about what font I\n\n217\n00:09:55.195 --> 00:09:58.183\nwant to choose is very easy\nbecause you have a drop down and\n\n218\n00:09:58.183 --> 00:10:00.940\nyou can look at it and\nsay that looks good.\n\n219\n00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.940\nBut just wanted to give you a little bit\nof a background as to the type face and\n\n220\n00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.550\ntype font type family and\nwhere it all comes from.\n\n221\n00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:12.110\n&gt;&gt; Well and that's a very good point to\nyou might not have thought as far as,\n\n222\n00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:16.980\nyeah, let's not use Comic Sans\nin our business presentation.\n\n223\n00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.560\nEven though it's a lot of fun and\n\n224\n00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.630\nyou love Comic Sans, just might\nnot be the appropriate venue for\n\n225\n00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.780\nthat as you're trying to speak to\na more business like audience.\n\n226\n00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.490\nSo just know your audience and\nthen use appropriate fonts.\n\n227\n00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.800\nGood news there are a many, many, many of\nthem out there from which to choose from.\n\n228\n00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then there's,\nthey also talk about rules,\n\n229\n00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.120\nof like you don't wanna have more\nthan two or three fonts on a slide.\n\n230\n00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.920\nWe talk about like in the layout design,\nlike design rules, you shouldn't have,\n\n231\n00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.360\nyou should usually use one font.\n\n232\n00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.070\nAnd, whatever the variations of that\nparticular font using that font family.\n\n233\n00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.185\nLike a Futura.\n\n234\n00:10:51.185 --> 00:10:53.240\nFutura has a bunch of different things and\n\n235\n00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.830\ndifferent variations\nwithin their font family.\n\n236\n00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:58.650\nSo I really like to use that font\na lot in some of my designs.\n\n237\n00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.375\nYeah, but, every rule is meant to\nbe broken for whatever reason.\n\n238\n00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:04.870\n[LAUGH] And\nwe keep on moving on with fonts.\n\n239\n00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.690\nWe also have a font size.\n\n240\n00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.210\nSo what size do I want?\n\n241\n00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:12.070\nAnd if we're talking about PowerPoint\nspecifically, you do have to think about\n\n242\n00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:16.160\nreadability, and visibility of people that\nyou are going to be presenting this to\n\n243\n00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.540\nthat might be all the way\nin the back of the room.\n\n244\n00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.400\nCan you read that text on that slide?\n\n245\n00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.450\nThat does make a difference.\n\n246\n00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.340\nDo you want to use a font that’s\nthis big on all of your slides?\n\n247\n00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.050\nThat might be a little harder to read.\n\n248\n00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:33.070\nAnd then, it kind of goes\nalong with picking your fonts.\n\n249\n00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:37.080\nSome fonts have thicker letters\nversus thinner letters and\n\n250\n00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.040\nwhich one is more readable.\n\n251\n00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.080\nIt all depends on where you're\nactually giving this presentation.\n\n252\n00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.550\nAnd all of these fonts on the left and\nright hand side or\n\n253\n00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.680\nall of these text blocks,\nthey're actually all the same size.\n\n254\n00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.840\nBut like, that's not the same size.\n\n255\n00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.330\nIt all depends on the font.\n\n256\n00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.630\nThat whole idea about those lines of like\nhow high each one of the letters is.\n\n257\n00:11:55.630 --> 00:12:00.530\nThat's also part of the font,\nit's like the scale if you want to say.\n\n258\n00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:05.270\nSo a 72 point Calibri font is\nnot the same as a 72 point\n\n259\n00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.350\nCordia font or a Franklin Gothic.\n\n260\n00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.480\nSo they're all the same size but\nthey look different.\n\n261\n00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.770\nSo, size does matter when you're\ntalking about your fonts and\n\n262\n00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.690\nwhich fonts you're using the sizes with.\n\n263\n00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:20.180\nEffects, how can I make something bold,\n\n264\n00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.630\nitalic, underlined,\ndouble underlined, strikethrough?\n\n265\n00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.970\nThese are all things that you\ncan create to any of your font.\n\n266\n00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:31.060\nNow, just because you put the bold,\nthat doesn't make your font back to curls.\n\n267\n00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.820\nCurls, it actually doesn't,\n\n268\n00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:37.600\ncurls bold doesn't really exist\nin the world of typography.\n\n269\n00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.980\nCan you make the test bold\nin PowerPoint or Word or\n\n270\n00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.180\nsome of the other Office programs?\n\n271\n00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.370\nYes, you can.\n\n272\n00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.830\nBut in the world of topography,\nit doesn't really exist.\n\n273\n00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:48.580\nSo, these are like,\n\n274\n00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:53.690\nmore visual effects a lot of times,\nthat you are putting on your characters.\n\n275\n00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:59.010\nAnd getting into some of these effects,\nyou do have to go into your format menu,\n\n276\n00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.740\nand go into your font dialogue\nbox to get the double underlines.\n\n277\n00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.190\nBut when we get to the episode where\nwe're actually going to be applying it,\n\n278\n00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.460\nI'll show you where it's at.\n\n279\n00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.450\nBut I just wanted to point that out.\n\n280\n00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.310\nColor, I love me some color.\n\n281\n00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:15.430\nWent a little crazy here with all these\ndifferent colors here on this screen.\n\n282\n00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:16.920\nBut color does say something too,\n\n283\n00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.140\nlike why would you pick something to\nbe purple versus blue versus yellow.\n\n284\n00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:24.760\nSo there's a whole psychology\nbehind why you want to pick colors.\n\n285\n00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.130\nSo you do have to kind of consider that\nand what message that's conveying.\n\n286\n00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:35.260\nBut the things that I have down below\nabout RGBCMYK, Hex, Pantone, and HSB.\n\n287\n00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.500\nI could talk forever about this,\nbut I'm going to condense it.\n\n288\n00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:43.120\nIn the world of PowerPoint, you're\nprobably not gonna need to worry too\n\n289\n00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.080\nmuch about this in the sense that\nyou're never Going to be, at least I\n\n290\n00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.520\nhope you shouldn't be because this is\nnot necessarily the correct program.\n\n291\n00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.280\nIf you're using this for\n\n292\n00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.370\ncommercial printing, I'm not talking\nabout printing it out on your printer or\n\n293\n00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:57.410\nsaying send it to a commercial\nprinter to get a book printed.\n\n294\n00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:00.260\nPowerPoint's definitely not\nthe program to do this in.\n\n295\n00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:05.090\nBut the different ways\nthat we can gauge or\n\n296\n00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:08.670\nvalues of color depends on what\nmedium you're going to be using.\n\n297\n00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.780\nIf you're going to be using a screen or\na website,\n\n298\n00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.900\nyou wanna measure your colors in R,\nG, B, red, green, and blue.\n\n299\n00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:20.110\nIf you're going to be using something\nin a commercial printing capacity,\n\n300\n00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.340\nyou would want your color\nvalues to measured in C, M, Y,\n\n301\n00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.710\nK, cyan, magenta, yellow and black\nbecause those are your colors of inks.\n\n302\n00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.980\nNow, if this getting a little too\nfar fetched for you, it's okay,\n\n303\n00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.870\nbut in the world of designing and\ngraphic design,\n\n304\n00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.520\nthis is very important and\nyou need to know about it.\n\n305\n00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:41.100\nAnd I actually wanted to show you\nsomething and why you would even want to\n\n306\n00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:45.078\nknow about this because maybe I'm making\na Power Point presentation for a company.\n\n307\n00:14:45.078 --> 00:14:50.050\nLet's say ITPro.TV and my job is to\ncreate that PowerPoint presentation,\n\n308\n00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:53.080\nto present to the board of directors.\n\n309\n00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.420\nWell, ITProTV is a branded company\nthat has a branded logo, and\n\n310\n00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.890\nthe logo has specific colors.\n\n311\n00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:03.910\nWell, what if I wanted to make sure\nthat I'm using the ITProTV orange, or\n\n312\n00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.930\nthe ITProTV blue?\n\n313\n00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:09.100\nA lot of companies will give out\nwhat are called branding briefs or\n\n314\n00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.980\nbranding guides to say that this\nis the guide that you need to\n\n315\n00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.270\nuse as a designer to design for\nour company.\n\n316\n00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:17.980\nAnd I believe its on, yes, page 12.\n\n317\n00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:23.890\nYou see that these are our ITProTV\ncolors and its giving the values for\n\n318\n00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.130\neach modality that I would need to\nbe measuring these color values in.\n\n319\n00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.330\nIf I was interested in something for\ncommercial print,\n\n320\n00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.300\nI would wanna use the CMYK values.\n\n321\n00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.190\nIt all looks the same, so that looks blue,\nthat's blue to you, right?\n\n322\n00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:37.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's blue.\n\n323\n00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:43.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, to me, I see it in either a\nCMYK value, an RGB value, or a HEX value.\n\n324\n00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.230\nA HEX value is when you're\ndoing things in HTML,\n\n325\n00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.860\nwhen you're doing things for websites.\n\n326\n00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.190\nYou can code your colors\nin hexadecimal codes.\n\n327\n00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:51.029\nI know you know a little but\nabout hexadecimal.\n\n328\n00:15:51.029 --> 00:15:52.173\n&gt;&gt; Just a little bit.\n\n329\n00:15:52.173 --> 00:15:53.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n330\n00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.512\n&gt;&gt; It's a weird world out\nthere in hexadecimal, [LAUGH]\n\n331\n00:15:55.512 --> 00:15:57.138\n&gt;&gt; 0 to 9.\n\n332\n00:15:57.138 --> 00:15:57.789\n&gt;&gt; Basic team.\n\n333\n00:15:57.789 --> 00:15:59.978\n&gt;&gt; A to F, is that right?\n\n334\n00:15:59.978 --> 00:16:01.249\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is, yes.\n\n335\n00:16:01.249 --> 00:16:04.722\n&gt;&gt; And it’s all numbers,\nI do know a little bit about that [LAUGH].\n\n336\n00:16:04.722 --> 00:16:05.536\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.\n\n337\n00:16:05.536 --> 00:16:07.610\nIt was interesting you’re talking.\n\n338\n00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.770\nDon and I are actually talking\nabout that this morning\n\n339\n00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.780\nbecause we were seeing the color pink\napparently does not actually exist.\n\n340\n00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.940\nIt’s not in the color spectrum.\n\n341\n00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.040\n&gt;&gt; In the light spectrum.\n\n342\n00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in the light spectrum, the prism.\n\n343\n00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.370\nRight?\nCan Pence Hone actually put a what\n\n344\n00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.810\nis it a patent on a color\nthat does not exist.\n\n345\n00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:29.200\n&gt;&gt; Well it doesn't exist in the light\nspectrum but it exist in the ink spectrum.\n\n346\n00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.830\n&gt;&gt; Does it?\n&gt;&gt; Yes that's what we're talking about.\n\n347\n00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:35.140\n&gt;&gt; But if light if we see\nthe color in an ink spectrum\n\n348\n00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.210\nbecause light reflects off of it,\n&gt;&gt; It's a trickery of\n\n349\n00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:39.550\nthe brain apparently.\n\n350\n00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:40.541\n&gt;&gt; We're getting a little too deep.\n\n351\n00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:41.523\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's funny.\n&gt;&gt; Pink is pink and\n\n352\n00:16:41.523 --> 00:16:44.040\npink exists because I love pink so\n[LAUGH].\n\n353\n00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.700\n&gt;&gt; This is just\nan interesting conversation.\n\n354\n00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:46.300\nYeah.\n\n355\n00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.990\n&gt;&gt; It is.\nAnd this is where if you start talking\n\n356\n00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.770\nabout colors you can go really deep.\n\n357\n00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:54.456\nBecause you have what it's in optics\nversus like what we were saying, how\n\n358\n00:16:54.456 --> 00:16:59.445\nthe light reflects off of the printed page\nfor us to be able to see the color, and\n\n359\n00:16:59.445 --> 00:17:04.904\nthat's why you have All of these different\nversions of RGB would be measuring light.\n\n360\n00:17:04.904 --> 00:17:08.697\nBecause when we're talking about things\non a screen, you have lights and\n\n361\n00:17:08.697 --> 00:17:10.420\nall that stuff in your monitor.\n\n362\n00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.230\nAnd so, it measures in red,\ngreen and blue.\n\n363\n00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:17.710\nBut when you talk about inks, then inks\nis when you have it mixing together.\n\n364\n00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:20.580\nAnd that's why you have them in\npercentages on a printing press,\n\n365\n00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:24.890\nof where it mixes certain percentages\nof cyan, magenta, yellow, or black and\n\n366\n00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:30.400\nthen it mixes down to create orange or\nthis light green and that's how it works.\n\n367\n00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.950\nSo, how light acts is different\nthan how inks act but\n\n368\n00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:38.130\nits all based on the spectrum\nwhere there expression come from.\n\n369\n00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:41.156\n&gt;&gt; By the way I agree with you\nthat pink exists cuz I've seen it.\n\n370\n00:17:41.156 --> 00:17:42.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n371\n00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.930\n&gt;&gt; I know you have two girls.\n\n372\n00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.158\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n373\n00:17:47.158 --> 00:17:50.050\n&gt;&gt; It's a fascinating thing if you start\n&gt;&gt; If you start looking through like\n\n374\n00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.250\nWikipedia articles and you start reading.\n\n375\n00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's like you can just\n\n376\n00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:53.070\ngo down that rabbit hole really.\n\n377\n00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.000\n&gt;&gt; That's a\n&gt;&gt; really fast.\n\n378\n00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.606\n&gt;&gt; Spiral yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I love reading about that stuff.\n\n379\n00:17:55.606 --> 00:17:57.157\n&gt;&gt; But it's very interesting,\nit's very interesting.\n\n380\n00:17:57.157 --> 00:18:01.265\n&gt;&gt; It is and so now back to PowerPoint\nlike why would you need to know,\n\n381\n00:18:01.265 --> 00:18:03.815\nif you are creating slides for ITProTV.\n\n382\n00:18:03.815 --> 00:18:09.758\nI want to make sure that I get\nthe right ITPro.TV orange.\n\n383\n00:18:09.758 --> 00:18:10.846\nAnd so I would use these values.\n\n384\n00:18:10.846 --> 00:18:18.030\nAnd the nice thing is, in PowerPoint for\n\n385\n00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:22.040\nMac, the nice thing is there is places\nwhere you can actually enter in.\n\n386\n00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.360\n&gt;&gt; The RGB or the CMYK value for\ncolors for you to be able to match it.\n\n387\n00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.640\nAnd there's actually a [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; I used a little dropper.\n\n388\n00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.175\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n389\n00:18:29.175 --> 00:18:30.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; More to come, I promise.\n\n390\n00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:31.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned for the next episode.\n\n391\n00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.360\nAll right, so\nI just wanted to go ahead and throw this.\n\n392\n00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.780\nAnd Pantone, Pantone is a company\nthat does have like a patent,\n\n393\n00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.660\nif you wanna say, on colors.\n\n394\n00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.560\nAnd so when you talked about Pantone 172,\n\n395\n00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.950\nPantone\n&gt;&gt; Pantone 287,\n\n396\n00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:45.990\nthose are, that's actually the University\nof Florida's orange and blue.\n\n397\n00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.710\nI memorized them cuz I did a lot there.\n\n398\n00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:49.355\n&gt;&gt; You worked there.\n\n399\n00:18:49.355 --> 00:18:50.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so all right.\n\n400\n00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.510\nColor, great, love color.\n\n401\n00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:55.130\nLet's move on to some other\ncharacter level formattings.\n\n402\n00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.330\nKerning and tracking,\nit's really known as character spacing.\n\n403\n00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:02.230\nThat's what it's known as in PowerPoint,\nI almost said Photoshop.\n\n404\n00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:05.818\n&gt;&gt; Hm. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; In PowerPoint, but\ntracking, we're really when we're talking\n\n405\n00:19:05.818 --> 00:19:09.130\nabout within the context of PowerPoint,\nit really is tracking.\n\n406\n00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.670\nTracking is the overall\nspacing of all the letters.\n\n407\n00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:16.510\nKerning is the spacing\ntwo specific characters.\n\n408\n00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:21.930\nYou cannot actually control the kerning\nbetween the characters in PowerPoint.\n\n409\n00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:26.610\nIt's really only tracking and they're\ngoing to refer to it as character spacing,\n\n410\n00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:27.860\ncuz that's what it really is.\n\n411\n00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:33.830\nThis is a tight spacing, this is a normal\nspacing and this is a loose spacing.\n\n412\n00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.080\nSo again gets that kind of connotation\nlike, what is it conveying?\n\n413\n00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:41.420\nit gives different meanings if you wanna\nsay it says something if your text is\n\n414\n00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:45.380\ntogether or more apart because\nit's some breathing room.\n\n415\n00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:50.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, evoke some abstract things inside\nof you that they're trying to convey.\n\n416\n00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:51.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n417\n00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:52.290\n&gt;&gt; It's art, that's what art does.\n\n418\n00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.530\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; This is a form of art,\n\n419\n00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:54.140\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n420\n00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.330\nYou're diving into it, good for you.\n\n421\n00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:56.650\n&gt;&gt; The art of typography.\n\n422\n00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:58.271\nI love I love this subject.\n\n423\n00:19:58.271 --> 00:20:01.060\n[LAUGH] Whoops, I went a little too fast.\n\n424\n00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.230\n&gt;&gt; She's getting crazy.\n\n425\n00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:04.930\n&gt;&gt; Let's move on to character, no,\nwe did character level formatting.\n\n426\n00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.400\nNow we're doing paragraph\nlevel formatting.\n\n427\n00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.990\nAs I said, any time you hit Enter or\nthe return key on your keyboard you're.\n\n428\n00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:11.580\nMaking a paragraph.\n\n429\n00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:15.170\nThe things that you could do in paragraph\nlevel formatting would be how is your text\n\n430\n00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:19.990\naligned within the area that is occupying?\n\n431\n00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:23.690\nWhether that is if you're in\nWord like between the margins or\n\n432\n00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:28.600\nin PowerPoint this space that\nyou place holder is occupying.\n\n433\n00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:33.550\nAnd so this would be left aligned\ncentered aligned, right aligned because\n\n434\n00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:38.010\nthe text block or the content block\nholder goes all the way to the sides,\n\n435\n00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.930\nthe ages of the sides, side,\nslide, the sides of the slide.\n\n436\n00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.015\nThat's what I'm trying to say.\n\n437\n00:20:43.015 --> 00:20:46.350\n[LAUGH] And then there's another\njustification, or alignment.\n\n438\n00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.470\nThere's justified text.\n\n439\n00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:50.020\nAnd these two examples here,\n\n440\n00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:54.910\nthe one on the left, there's something\nknown in type Setting as a Right Rag.\n\n441\n00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.716\nSo you have a right hand side\nof this is kind of ragged.\n\n442\n00:20:57.716 --> 00:21:00.200\nIt doesn't line up.\n\n443\n00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.340\nWell, that's fine if you wanted\nto have left-aligned text, but\n\n444\n00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:08.640\nthis example over here, this would be\njustified text or full justification.\n\n445\n00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.670\nTo where it takes the edges and it kind\nof stretches, if you wanna say, all of\n\n446\n00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:20.320\nthe spacing of your words to go ahead and\ngo right against those two Margins.\n\n447\n00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:27.320\nOr the size of whatever the area that your\ntext is occupying, so justified text.\n\n448\n00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.900\nSome other character, no paragraph,\nparagraph before bullets and\n\n449\n00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.700\nnumbering, so\nwe have different bullet characters.\n\n450\n00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:39.990\nBut notice how different between\nthis pink, we're talking about pink.\n\n451\n00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.700\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n452\n00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.140\n&gt;&gt; I know, there we go.\n\n453\n00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.056\nIt does exist.\n\n454\n00:21:43.056 --> 00:21:43.817\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Kind of.\n\n455\n00:21:43.817 --> 00:21:44.985\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can see it.\n\n456\n00:21:44.985 --> 00:21:48.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the text here is like the text and\n\n457\n00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:52.350\nthe bullet is formatted versus this\nexample of where only the bullet is pink\n\n458\n00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:53.590\nand not the text.\n\n459\n00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.470\nSo getting in to your bullets and\nnumbering formatting\n\n460\n00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.550\nIs something different than just\nchanging the color of the font.\n\n461\n00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:02.510\nSo that's at character and\nparagraph level.\n\n462\n00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:05.500\nAnd notice how these bullets\nare further away from the text.\n\n463\n00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.310\nSo the text is further\naway from the bullets.\n\n464\n00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:11.050\nAnd that's how you can control\nthe spacing between that.\n\n465\n00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:14.010\nNormally in other programs that's where\nyou're going to be controlling your\n\n466\n00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.350\ntabs and your first line indents and\nyour right line indents.\n\n467\n00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:19.190\nIn this program is really just\nwhere does the bullet sit and\n\n468\n00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:20.300\nwhere does the text sit?\n\n469\n00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.870\nSo that's an easier way of explaining it.\n\n470\n00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:26.100\nYou could also have numbered\nlists instead of bulleted lists.\n\n471\n00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.840\nAnd you could also create\nbullets with little bunny faces,\n\n472\n00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:34.930\nbecause you have an option of creating\nemojis as bullet characters in Macintosh.\n\n473\n00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.910\nAnd you could create different things for\nyour bullet.\n\n474\n00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:39.580\nSo we're going to be talking\nabout formatting bullets.\n\n475\n00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.560\nAnd this is a paragraph level formatting.\n\n476\n00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:46.700\nBecause if I put my cursor here and\njust kept typing and typing and typing.\n\n477\n00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:51.690\nYou see I haven't hit Enter yet so\nall of that text is, the bullet is for\n\n478\n00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:52.970\nthe whole paragraph.\n\n479\n00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:57.590\nAs soon as you hit Enter that's where\nthe next bullet is going to be created.\n\n480\n00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:59.680\nSo that's why it is a paragraph.\n\n481\n00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.980\nLevel formating, even though sometimes\nit doesn't look like a paragraph,\n\n482\n00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:09.160\nit just looks like a line of text,\nbut technically is still a paragraph.\n\n483\n00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.500\nWhat's the slide?\n\n484\n00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.220\nLeading.\nLeading, yes,\n\n485\n00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.180\nleading is-\n&gt;&gt; That says leading.\n\n486\n00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:12.705\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n487\n00:23:12.705 --> 00:23:15.075\n&gt;&gt; True, tomato, tomato.\n\n488\n00:23:15.075 --> 00:23:15.865\nSo in this case,\n\n489\n00:23:15.865 --> 00:23:18.770\nwhen we're talking about text\nwe're talking about leading.\n\n490\n00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.610\nLeading is the space\nbetween the baselines.\n\n491\n00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:23.990\nRemember back to the lines\nwith the text that's on when\n\n492\n00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.110\nwe were trying to learn how we write?\n\n493\n00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:29.310\n&gt;&gt; That is your baseline and\nthe space between the baselines.\n\n494\n00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:32.390\nYou're never gonna really see it\nreferred to as Leading in PowerPoint.\n\n495\n00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.500\nYou're gonna see it referred\nto as Line Spacing.\n\n496\n00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.250\nAnd that's double space or\n\n497\n00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:40.080\nsingle space when we're writing our\nterm papers on our college ruled paper.\n\n498\n00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:40.760\nYou know what?\n\n499\n00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.130\nWhen you said the wide ruled paper and\n\n500\n00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.250\nthe college ruled,\nThat's a change in leading, yes.\n\n501\n00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:44.930\n&gt;&gt; Well there you go.\n\n502\n00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:46.930\n&gt;&gt; Cuz remember college ruled\nwas a lot closer together?\n\n503\n00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:47.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, closer together, that's right.\n\n504\n00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:48.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's leading.\n\n505\n00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.660\n&gt;&gt; Give you more lines.\n\n506\n00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.271\nThat's why no one ever used it.\n\n507\n00:23:51.271 --> 00:23:53.460\n[LAUGH] They're like no, no, no.\n\n508\n00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:54.401\nThis is one page?\n\n509\n00:23:54.401 --> 00:23:55.468\nWe're gonna make it easy on myself.\n\n510\n00:23:55.468 --> 00:23:58.905\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I remember when you.\n\n511\n00:23:58.905 --> 00:24:02.283\nIt was back where you actually had to turn\nthings in from typing on the computer.\n\n512\n00:24:02.283 --> 00:24:05.670\nIt was always you had to have it double\nspaced and then it took off the red marker\n\n513\n00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:08.590\nand marked all your stuff up,\nyour school papers, ooh gosh.\n\n514\n00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.810\nI was actually pretty good at that.\n\n515\n00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:16.180\nBut letting, letting is different than\nthe space between the paragraphs.\n\n516\n00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:20.290\nSo you see here, the spacing is\nnot between each line of the text.\n\n517\n00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:23.830\nThe spacing is between the paragraphs,\nafter you hit the enter so\n\n518\n00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:24.990\nyou do that carriage return.\n\n519\n00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:32.240\nHow much space after I hit enter is going\nto be created until I hit enter again.\n\n520\n00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.680\nAnd that is space after a paragraph.\n\n521\n00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.360\nYou could put space before or\nafter or both.\n\n522\n00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.350\nBut then if you think about it,\nif you had it above and\n\n523\n00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.530\nbelow then you're actually\ngonna do like a doubling.\n\n524\n00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:44.340\nAnd sometimes that can throw people off.\n\n525\n00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.810\nLike, why is it creating so much space?\n\n526\n00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:53.000\nIt's because there are settings every time\nyou hit the enter key to create that.\n\n527\n00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.720\nBut again, in PowerPoint all of this\nletting space before, space after,\n\n528\n00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.190\nit's all considered line spacing.\n\n529\n00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.410\nIn slide 14, we have columns.\n\n530\n00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.230\nColumns is another\nparagraph level formatting.\n\n531\n00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:07.750\nI take a paragraph and\nsplit it across columns.\n\n532\n00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:12.110\nIn this sense, you might think of it\nas columns within your placeholder,\n\n533\n00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:16.750\nwithin your content area, but it's still\na paragraph level formatting of how\n\n534\n00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:20.230\nmany columns do I want and how much\nspace do I want between my columns.\n\n535\n00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.370\nSo, that's something will be formating.\n\n536\n00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:26.270\nAnother thing we have in formatting\nare text and really it's more\n\n537\n00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:31.840\nin conjunction with it being\nin a place holder area.\n\n538\n00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.400\nYou have the vertical\nalignment of your text, and\n\n539\n00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.100\nyou can see you have a top alignment\nverses middle alignment, verses bottom\n\n540\n00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:44.090\nalignment of where it sits within the,\nThe space that it occupies as well.\n\n541\n00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:47.830\nYou also have a direction of the text that\nyou could do, you could turn it one way or\n\n542\n00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:51.700\nanother or you could have it stacked\nto where it wants to go down but\n\n543\n00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:56.530\nyou want the letters to still be upright\nrather than turn the entire letters.\n\n544\n00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:59.900\nSo that is a paragraph level\nformatting in PowerPoint.\n\n545\n00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:04.520\nAnd then you also have indents of\nhow you can indent your paragraphs\n\n546\n00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.980\nback to learning how to write and\nwrite papers.\n\n547\n00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:11.790\nI remember we're always told we had to\nindent the first line of your paragraphs.\n\n548\n00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:14.650\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the tab or the.\n\n549\n00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:17.430\n&gt;&gt; So many spaces or whatever space.\n\n550\n00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:21.310\n&gt;&gt; Five spaces, yes or\nthat's at least how I was taught.\n\n551\n00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:21.932\n&gt;&gt; What's that was for?\n\n552\n00:26:21.932 --> 00:26:23.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Who have thought of these things?\n\n553\n00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:24.450\n&gt;&gt; I thin that.\n&gt;&gt; Wherever you're from,\n\n554\n00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.160\nmaybe they'll change it.\n\n555\n00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.119\n&gt;&gt; And how many spaces after a period?\n\n556\n00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:32.450\nWell, there's always one space, right?\n\n557\n00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:35.320\nBecause you can't have a capital letter\nbutted right up next to a period so\n\n558\n00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.120\nyou've got one.\n\n559\n00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.120\n&gt;&gt; So you were taught one?\n\n560\n00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:42.710\n&gt;&gt; Well I was taught that you had to\ndo two spaces after every period.\n\n561\n00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.860\nIt was period, space, space.\n\n562\n00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:45.828\n&gt;&gt; That seems pretentious.\n\n563\n00:26:45.828 --> 00:26:46.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well\n\n564\n00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.590\n&gt;&gt; I might be dating myself.\n\n565\n00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:51.580\na little bit, but we were still\nactually using like old typewriters.\n\n566\n00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.310\nI'm not saying like super old typewriters.\n\n567\n00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:54.520\n&gt;&gt; Those electric IBMs?\n\n568\n00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n569\n00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, typing class.\n\n570\n00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.660\n&gt;&gt; You had the correction button, right?\n\n571\n00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.730\nYou had the correcting tape?\n\n572\n00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:00.145\nThose things were awesome.\n\n573\n00:27:00.145 --> 00:27:01.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, exactly.\n\n574\n00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:05.230\nWell it kind of goes back to that whole\nidea is because when you have, and\n\n575\n00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:06.980\nthis, and\nI wanna actually go to another slide.\n\n576\n00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.510\nI wanna go back to a slide because I think\nthere's something that I forgot to talk\n\n577\n00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.340\nabout was when you're talking about fonts.\n\n578\n00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:16.790\nYou also have thick width fonts and\nyou have proportional width fonts.\n\n579\n00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:19.780\nAnd this example right\nhere like the word family.\n\n580\n00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.970\nDo you see how the i and\nthe l, they're smaller?\n\n581\n00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:26.450\nLike they're smaller than the letter M,\n\n582\n00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:29.370\nthe m has a specific\nwidth that is occupying.\n\n583\n00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:34.030\nThe i and the l have a width that is\noccupying as well, but the width is\n\n584\n00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:38.970\nproportional based on how much space\nthat character actually needs to take.\n\n585\n00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.860\n&gt;&gt; Tries not to take up more\nroom than it actually needs.\n\n586\n00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.010\n&gt;&gt; It proportionally changes the width.\n\n587\n00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:47.950\nAs opposed to a fixed width font,\nor a monospaced font.\n\n588\n00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:53.210\nAs this letter A, if I highlight it,\nhas the same amount of space that\n\n589\n00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:57.560\nthe M does, or the same amount of\nspace that the I does, or the L.\n\n590\n00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.940\nAnd so you have Fix with fonts and\n\n591\n00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.300\nthis is actually kind of\nback to the old typewriters.\n\n592\n00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:03.900\nRemember, the keys in the typewriter.\n\n593\n00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:04.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n594\n00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.410\n&gt;&gt; They have certain space.\n\n595\n00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:07.750\nSome of like the letters are actually\nsmaller than the space and\n\n596\n00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:10.570\nso you have the monospace fonts.\n\n597\n00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:15.920\nAnd it was known to be if you put\ntwo spaces after your periods.\n\n598\n00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.740\nIt would go ahead and\nmake the readability little easier.\n\n599\n00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:23.280\nIt's easier to read with the two spaces\ncuz you know where your sentences\n\n600\n00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.260\nstart and stop.\n\n601\n00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:28.090\nAnd so that's why I was taught\nthat it was two spaces.\n\n602\n00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:33.110\nBut with computers and\nwith how all of these devices can,\n\n603\n00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:37.150\nand proportional width fonts became\nthe norm, the two spaces after\n\n604\n00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:41.770\na period is not necessarily as a hard and\ntrue rule as it used to be.\n\n605\n00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:46.350\nSo honestly it's a stylistic Do it.\n\n606\n00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:50.000\nIf you want to do one,\nyou want to do two, just be consistent\n\n607\n00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.770\ncuz I've done a lot of type setting for\ndifferent textbooks and everything.\n\n608\n00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:56.110\nIf you do one, do one throughout.\n\n609\n00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.700\nIf you do two, do two throughout.\n\n610\n00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:58.910\nSo it's just, that was the rule.\n\n611\n00:28:58.910 --> 00:28:59.620\n&gt;&gt; So just, yeah.\n\n612\n00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.530\nKeep that consistency across the board,\nand then people won't think.\n\n613\n00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.330\nHey this person's Cuckoo for\nCocoa Puffs [LAUGH].\n\n614\n00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:07.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I'm sure there's always\npeople out there that are going to debate.\n\n615\n00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:08.740\nWe're like no it has to be two.\n\n616\n00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.490\nIt has to be one.\n\n617\n00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:12.460\nKind of like syllabi or syllabuses.\n\n618\n00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.480\n&gt;&gt; They're both correct but\n\n619\n00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.400\nit just depends on which way\nthat you want to talk about it.\n\n620\n00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.660\n&gt;&gt; My favorite as the Oxford comma.\n\n621\n00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.160\nI am an Oxford comma man.\n\n622\n00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.760\n&gt;&gt; I am, too.\n&gt;&gt; I think that there is a good\n\n623\n00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.510\nreason for it.\n\n624\n00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:24.180\nAnd then there are reasons not to use it,\n\n625\n00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.840\ncuz then it's not an Oxford\ncomma at that point.\n\n626\n00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We digress, continue [LAUGH]\n\n627\n00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.050\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, but that's where it kind of\n\n628\n00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:31.590\ncame back.\n\n629\n00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:37.930\nAnd where we came from that was from\nthe indents down here of do you want to\n\n630\n00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:43.020\ndo a first line indent verses\na hanging indent verses a full indent\n\n631\n00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:48.420\nlike your left indent you come in from the\nsides of your margins and you can use that\n\n632\n00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:53.220\nthrough the use of your ruler and how you\ncan go ahead and change those indents.\n\n633\n00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:57.620\nLike I said we will be applying how to\ndo these indents in the next episode.\n\n634\n00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:00.030\nRight now we kinda just talking about how\n\n635\n00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:02.940\nwhat's in there in\nthe different example of them.\n\n636\n00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:06.024\nAnd then the last slide, tabs.\n\n637\n00:30:06.024 --> 00:30:08.312\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I love,\n\n638\n00:30:08.312 --> 00:30:13.960\nin PowerPoint I would say\nhonestly just use the table,\n\n639\n00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:18.350\nbut have you ever done more you types\na word and you hit the tab key in the key.\n\n640\n00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.350\nAnd how many spaces in the tab?\n\n641\n00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:21.540\n&gt;&gt; I think it's four.\n\n642\n00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.000\nThat's what I think I've been told,\nis four spaces.\n\n643\n00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.460\n&gt;&gt; I was told it was five, [LAUGH].\n\n644\n00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:30.450\nBut the thing is, it's actually\nnot a specific amount of spaces.\n\n645\n00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:34.480\nBecause if it was, every time you'd hit\nthe Tab key it would go a specific amount.\n\n646\n00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:38.320\nWell, when you're talking about computers,\nthe thing about Tabs you have stops.\n\n647\n00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.490\nWhere does the Tab stop\nwhen you hit the Tab key?\n\n648\n00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:45.070\nAnd the default is every half an inch.\n\n649\n00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:46.980\n&gt;&gt; And so\nthat's why when you type in like for\n\n650\n00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.640\nright here this looks really weird, right?\n\n651\n00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.850\nBut it is word, tab, word, tab, enter.\n\n652\n00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.570\nWord, tab, word, tab, enter.\n\n653\n00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:59.440\nBut because Certain words\nare longer than others.\n\n654\n00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.960\nThere's a tab between fuego and\n\n655\n00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.030\ncat, the same word there is\na tab between first and last.\n\n656\n00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:09.920\nBut it doesn't look the same\nbecause fuego occupies more space,\n\n657\n00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.430\nbecause of that proportional\nwidth font and everything.\n\n658\n00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:15.470\nSo the tab, it actually does start here.\n\n659\n00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:18.850\n&gt;&gt; Right, because it's in line with\nthe word last at the very top line there.\n\n660\n00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:21.810\n&gt;&gt; But between Vaughn and\nSmith, there's only one tab too.\n\n661\n00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:23.580\nBut do you see where it lined up?\n\n662\n00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.440\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; The next one because the word von\n\n663\n00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.780\nactually went past the half\ninch mark on the ruler-\n\n664\n00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.340\n&gt;&gt; So it said I can't go into that tab\n\n665\n00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.230\nspace, I gotta go to the next.\n\n666\n00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:31.200\n&gt;&gt; I gotta go to the next one, yes.\n\n667\n00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.820\n&gt;&gt; Make sense.\n&gt;&gt; And so that's whole idea about tabs and\n\n668\n00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.800\nformatting tab stops is one\nof my favorite lessons.\n\n669\n00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.626\nIt has people like,\nI totally understand now.\n\n670\n00:31:40.626 --> 00:31:47.161\nBut in PowerPoint, you don't actually\nsee the tab, like the hidden characters.\n\n671\n00:31:47.161 --> 00:31:51.541\nIn Word, you can actually see the hidden\ncharacters like anytime you hit the space\n\n672\n00:31:51.541 --> 00:31:53.189\nor any time you hit the tab key,\n\n673\n00:31:53.189 --> 00:31:56.574\nanytime you did a A line break\ninstead of a full character turn.\n\n674\n00:31:56.574 --> 00:31:58.610\nYou can see all these things.\n\n675\n00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:00.400\nAnd as somebody like me\nwho has a typesetter.\n\n676\n00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.770\nLike I need to see what this is because\nif it's with tabs then I need to know to\n\n677\n00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:04.710\nformat with tab stops.\n\n678\n00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:06.773\nOr if somebody's done like space, space,\nspace, space, which a lot of people do.\n\n679\n00:32:06.773 --> 00:32:07.584\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n680\n00:32:07.584 --> 00:32:11.217\n&gt;&gt; I'm not saying it's wrong, but\nit's just something that I need to know so\n\n681\n00:32:11.217 --> 00:32:12.670\nI know how to be able to fix it.\n\n682\n00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:14.400\nOr like why does this keep moving?\n\n683\n00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.410\nYou might have a line break in there\nthat you don't even know about, but\n\n684\n00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:20.060\nit's always good to have those\nshow hidden characters on.\n\n685\n00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:22.170\nYou don't have it in Powerpoint, but\n\n686\n00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:27.210\nyou can format tab stops in Powerpoint,\njust like you can in Word.\n\n687\n00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:30.960\nAnd it does go along with using the ruler,\nand so you can basically say,\n\n688\n00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.970\nall of these paragraphs,\nany time there is a tab,\n\n689\n00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:38.410\nI want it to stop at a specific\nplace on the ruler that I designate.\n\n690\n00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:39.720\nRather than the default tabs.\n\n691\n00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:45.600\nAnd so you can reformat them to say,\ngo to this tab and stop,\n\n692\n00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.850\nnext tab, stopped and how that aligns.\n\n693\n00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:52.420\nBecause you see these here that is a\nformatted tab stop is right aligned versus\n\n694\n00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:52.980\nleft aligned.\n\n695\n00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.650\nAnd so where the tab stops and\n\n696\n00:32:54.650 --> 00:33:00.010\nthen how the text aligns at that\nstop is all about formatting tabs.\n\n697\n00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:03.920\nAnd, like I said, it might just be easier,\njust throw this in a table and\n\n698\n00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:04.880\nit makes it a lot easier [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n699\n00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.400\nforget using all that tab business right,\n\n700\n00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.170\nthat can just become a fool's\nerrand at some point, right?\n\n701\n00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:12.465\n&gt;&gt; Yes but they do exist, so in case you\never come across something that does have\n\n702\n00:33:12.465 --> 00:33:15.840\ntabs, but again you couldn't even see\nif there were tabs to begin with.\n\n703\n00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:20.178\nSo, it might be a little more\nconfusing to say in PowerPoint, but\n\n704\n00:33:20.178 --> 00:33:25.840\nif you get into Word, that's where we will\nbe doing a little bit more with tabs,\n\n705\n00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.160\nyou can see them a little bit better.\n\n706\n00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.570\nBut I will show you how to format tabs,\njust because I like to.\n\n707\n00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:31.572\n&gt;&gt; That's very cool stuff.\n\n708\n00:33:31.572 --> 00:33:32.950\nIt was actually very interesting,\n\n709\n00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:36.580\nhopefully you guys out there or\nfinding it just as interesting as we do.\n\n710\n00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:40.640\nJust to all the and cool things that\nyou can do with as far as character\n\n711\n00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.720\nformatting, paragraph formatting,\nall there little characteristics and\n\n712\n00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.110\nthat should be such you can play with.\n\n713\n00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:48.000\nAnd then the interesting\nfield of topography,\n\n714\n00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.395\nif it sounds fascinating definitely\ndive into that learn more about it.\n\n715\n00:33:51.395 --> 00:33:56.290\nIt's all about creating effective slides\nusing these techniques that will convey\n\n716\n00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:59.700\nexactly what you want inside of your\npresentation, that's what it's all about.\n\n717\n00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.390\nSo, don't think that this was just a, wow,\n\n718\n00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:04.420\nthat's a very nice theory,\nepisode we're having here.\n\n719\n00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.820\nIt does actually have application, so\npay attention, it can help you out.\n\n720\n00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.380\nYou never know when it's\ngonna come in handy.\n\n721\n00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.620\nVonne, thank you so much for\nintroducing us to these ideas and\n\n722\n00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.720\nconcepts, and\neven a practically how we can use them.\n\n723\n00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.330\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it,\nbut it looks like it's that time for\n\n724\n00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:19.400\nus to sign off.\n\n725\n00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.620\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n726\n00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:22.530\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.064 --> 00:00:13.920\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.870\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.071\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:23.283\nwe are back with more PowerPoint 2016 for\nMAC users.\n\n9\n00:00:23.283 --> 00:00:27.353\nAnd joining me in the studio is the person\nwho puts the excitement in our show and\n\n10\n00:00:27.353 --> 00:00:28.730\nthat is Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.300\nVonne, welcome back.\n\n12\n00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.952\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:29.952 --> 00:00:31.090\n&gt;&gt; Hi, how're you doing?\n\n14\n00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.300\n[LAUGH] Is that exciting enough?\n\n15\n00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.684\n&gt;&gt; I'm just a little scared.\n&gt;&gt; Sorry about that guys.\n\n16\n00:00:35.684 --> 00:00:41.270\nAs Daniel said, we are back with\nthis episode of formatting text.\n\n17\n00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.335\nWe are going to be taking everything that\nwe have learned in the character and\n\n18\n00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:47.127\nparagraph formatting episode.\n\n19\n00:00:47.127 --> 00:00:48.284\nAnd we're going to be applying it.\n\n20\n00:00:48.284 --> 00:00:51.254\nThis is where we're going to change\nthe font, we're gonna change the size,\n\n21\n00:00:51.254 --> 00:00:53.760\nwe're gonna make it bold,\nwe're gonna make it center.\n\n22\n00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.440\nDo all the little buttons that\nare on the home tab ribbon.\n\n23\n00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.600\nSo we're going to jump in and\nI already have a file opened up for us,\n\n24\n00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.210\nit is called formattext.pptx.\n\n25\n00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.620\nAnd just as a reminder,\n\n26\n00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.200\nin slide two we have the different\nlevels of formatting that we have.\n\n27\n00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.032\nWe have our character level formatting,\nand we have our paragraph level formatting\n\n28\n00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:18.332\nand the different things we can do in\neach side, I would say, of the slide.\n\n29\n00:01:18.332 --> 00:01:22.953\nAnd like I had said this, we are gonna be\nspending most of our time in the home tab\n\n30\n00:01:22.953 --> 00:01:26.960\nof our ribbon and in the font group and\nthe paragraph group.\n\n31\n00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.718\nSo slide three, I have a, what is this?\n\n32\n00:01:31.718 --> 00:01:33.691\nThis is-\n&gt;&gt; An interesting paragraph.\n\n33\n00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:36.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is in title,\nthat's what I was trying to say.\n\n34\n00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.607\nIt is named Character Formatting.\n\n35\n00:01:38.607 --> 00:01:39.684\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you go.\n\n36\n00:01:39.684 --> 00:01:40.908\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so guess what we're gonna do?\n\n37\n00:01:40.908 --> 00:01:42.214\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna format a paragraph?\n\n38\n00:01:42.214 --> 00:01:43.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n39\n00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.280\n&gt;&gt; Or a character.\n\n40\n00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.945\n&gt;&gt; That's slide four.\n\n41\n00:01:44.945 --> 00:01:46.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's slide four.\n\n42\n00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.850\n&gt;&gt; So slide three I've got, okay let's go\nahead and do some character formatting.\n\n43\n00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.200\nLet's take this headline and this title.\n\n44\n00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.050\nAnd we're going to select it,\ncuz if you are going to be doing character\n\n45\n00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.655\nformatting you do need to select all\nof the words that you want to effect.\n\n46\n00:01:59.655 --> 00:02:03.605\nThat's select to effect, and so\nI've selected all my text in here.\n\n47\n00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:07.195\nI'm going to come up here to my font,\nand we talked about font and\n\n48\n00:02:07.195 --> 00:02:09.790\nfont families in our previous episode.\n\n49\n00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.200\nAnd so you have Arial, but\nyou just don't have Arial.\n\n50\n00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.780\nYou have all of the different types, if\nyou wanna say, or family members of Arial.\n\n51\n00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.380\nSo you have that Italic,\nBold Italic and Black.\n\n52\n00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.400\nAs you see, Apple Chancery though,\nit doesn't have any other versions, or\n\n53\n00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.130\nother Family members.\n\n54\n00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.860\nIt just exists as itself.\n\n55\n00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.826\nSo those little triangles off to the right\nhand side of each one of your options.\n\n56\n00:02:34.826 --> 00:02:39.578\nJust denotes that you have other\nmembers of that font family that\n\n57\n00:02:39.578 --> 00:02:41.790\nyou could choose from.\n\n58\n00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.070\nSo let's just pick one.\n\n59\n00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.740\nIf I sit here too long, I will look.\n\n60\n00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.200\nI always love Cooper Black.\n\n61\n00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.329\n&gt;&gt; Who doesn't?\n\n62\n00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.702\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's the wrong font.\n\n63\n00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:52.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's right there.\n\n64\n00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.610\nThat's the one I wanted.\n\n65\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.149\nIt reminds me of-\n&gt;&gt; That's Garfield, that's a Garfield.\n\n66\n00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.901\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n67\n00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:00.550\nI think that's the formatting,\nor the font they use.\n\n68\n00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.265\n&gt;&gt; That's funny how we\nhave different memories.\n\n69\n00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:03.043\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n70\n00:03:03.043 --> 00:03:05.783\n&gt;&gt; This reminds me of those iron\non letters that you used to have.\n\n71\n00:03:05.783 --> 00:03:06.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n72\n00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.484\n&gt;&gt; And of course,\ncuz I would go to stores and\n\n73\n00:03:08.484 --> 00:03:11.455\nthere would never be anything\npersonalized with my name.\n\n74\n00:03:11.455 --> 00:03:14.425\n&gt;&gt; Because your name is spelled wrong,\nwe covered that.\n\n75\n00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:15.180\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes and so\n\n76\n00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.680\nthere was nothing that said Vonne,\n\n77\n00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.010\nso my mom would make me\nshirts with my name spelled.\n\n78\n00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.250\nAnd for some reason, this particular\nfont reminds me of iron-on letters.\n\n79\n00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.142\n&gt;&gt; It does.\nI'd say,\n\n80\n00:03:24.142 --> 00:03:27.181\nit's probably the one they use because\nthat's exactly what I can see your name on\n\n81\n00:03:27.181 --> 00:03:27.723\nit right now.\n\n82\n00:03:27.723 --> 00:03:30.124\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, like my mom loves me.\n\n83\n00:03:30.124 --> 00:03:31.644\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Now that you've said\n\n84\n00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:34.360\nGarfield though,\nbecause I love those Garfield books.\n\n85\n00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.449\n&gt;&gt; Isn't that it?\n&gt;&gt; This is totally, I think it is.\n\n86\n00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:37.340\n&gt;&gt; I think that might be it.\n\n87\n00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.549\n&gt;&gt; Well, talking about Garfield,\nwhy don't we make it orange?\n\n88\n00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.339\n[LAUGH] Why don't we,\nyeah, I think [CROSSTALK]\n\n89\n00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:42.725\n&gt;&gt; Why don't we go with that\n\n90\n00:03:42.725 --> 00:03:43.850\nas a theme, right?\n\n91\n00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.630\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and Garfield was a big cat.\n\n92\n00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.280\n&gt;&gt; He was.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n93\n00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.660\nwe need to make this font bigger.\n\n94\n00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.980\nSo let's keep formatting\nthis in the Garfield theme.\n\n95\n00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.610\nWe're going to take our font size,\n\n96\n00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.280\nwhich is the drop down right next\nto it with the different numbers.\n\n97\n00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.560\n&gt;&gt; And this is where we can go bigger or\nwe can go smaller.\n\n98\n00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.190\nSo maybe if I choose 72, but\nmaybe that's just a little too big.\n\n99\n00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.180\nWe have what I call the bumpy arrows.\n\n100\n00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.290\nI can bump it down or bump it up,\nincrease or decrease my font size.\n\n101\n00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.300\nSo maybe I wanna just go one\nlevel down and okay, that's good.\n\n102\n00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.530\nNow if I bump it down and\nit's going between 66 and\n\n103\n00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.440\nthe next iteration would be 72.\n\n104\n00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.560\nIf you wanted it to be 68 or 71,\n\n105\n00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.940\nyou can come into the font field right\nhere and physically type in the number 68.\n\n106\n00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.350\nAnd then it will go ahead and\nmake it that particular size.\n\n107\n00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.980\nSo you don't have to go with\nthe iterations that they give you.\n\n108\n00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.570\nYou can type it in if you want.\n\n109\n00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.800\nLet's keep on going down\nto the next row of buttons.\n\n110\n00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.890\nWe have our effects that\nwe could apply on here.\n\n111\n00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.220\nHow to make something bold,\nhow to make something italics.\n\n112\n00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.300\nNow for this particular font,\nCooper Black is already kind of bold.\n\n113\n00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.700\nSo if I click Bold, it doesn't\nreally do anything and that's okay.\n\n114\n00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.460\nSo that's the whole idea of that,\nit doesn't really exist as bold.\n\n115\n00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.800\nAnd it already is bold, and so\n\n116\n00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.730\nit's not gonna do it, so\ndon't be alarmed if like it doesn't apply.\n\n117\n00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.340\nIf I was choosing say a different font,\n\n118\n00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.950\nif I was choosing this Constantina and\nthen I hit Bold.\n\n119\n00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.570\nNow it is going to make the letters\nactually thicker looking if you wanna say.\n\n120\n00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.182\nSo I'm just undoing by the way,\nI'm doing a Cmd+Z to\n\n121\n00:05:15.182 --> 00:05:17.789\nback up because I really wanna keep-\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna lose that\n\n122\n00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:18.490\nGarfield font.\n\n123\n00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know right?\n\n124\n00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.076\n&gt;&gt; I'm looking it up by the way,\nit's totally the Garfield font.\n\n125\n00:05:21.076 --> 00:05:21.817\n&gt;&gt; Is it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n126\n00:05:21.817 --> 00:05:22.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay, awesome.\n\n127\n00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.142\n&gt;&gt; When I say the Garfield font,\n\n128\n00:05:24.142 --> 00:05:28.464\nI mean not the font he uses to write the\nwords and stuff, the thought bubbles or\n\n129\n00:05:28.464 --> 00:05:31.278\nthe speech bubbles, but\nthe titles of the books.\n\n130\n00:05:31.278 --> 00:05:31.969\nThis is it, yes.\n\n131\n00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:33.199\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and I had those books.\n\n132\n00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.108\n&gt;&gt; I did too, I love them.\n\n133\n00:05:34.108 --> 00:05:38.770\n&gt;&gt; I love those.\n[LAUGH] So continuing on we have italic.\n\n134\n00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.960\nSo that just kinda slants it and\nthen you could also have it underlined.\n\n135\n00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.200\nNow a lot of times when people go ahead\nand apply these formats and these effects,\n\n136\n00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.730\nthey're like, well then,\nhow do I take it off?\n\n137\n00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.690\nI don't want it to be italics.\n\n138\n00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.220\nIt's kinda like turning\na light switch on or off.\n\n139\n00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.610\nYou turn the italic on, to turn it off,\nyou just click the button.\n\n140\n00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.700\nAnd the buttons actually looks like it's\nkind of pressed in on those on the ribbon.\n\n141\n00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.250\nSo if you click it again,\nit takes the italic off.\n\n142\n00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.500\nAnd it could also take\nthe underlining off there.\n\n143\n00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.880\nYou also have your strike through\nif you wanted to as well.\n\n144\n00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.650\nNow the previous episode I\ndid show a slide that had\n\n145\n00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.359\ndouble underlines on that as an effect.\n\n146\n00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.200\nIf you do want that effect\nyou need to go into the menu.\n\n147\n00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.800\nWe've already said in our introduction\nto PowerPoint, that a lot of times\n\n148\n00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.200\nin the environment, everything you\nneed is pretty much on the ribbon.\n\n149\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.680\nBut every once in a while,\nif you need to, you can go to your menu.\n\n150\n00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.760\nAnd if I go to my formatting menu or\nFormat menu and I go to Font.\n\n151\n00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.110\nIt'll bring up the font dialog box and\nthat's were you have a few extra\n\n152\n00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.830\noptions here in your underline styles and\nyour underline color.\n\n153\n00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.360\nSo you can have a text color that's\ndifferent from your underline color.\n\n154\n00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.840\nIf you wanted to.\n\n155\n00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.446\nSo I mean, cuz he was orange and\nblack, so maybe we could go with that.\n\n156\n00:06:49.446 --> 00:06:50.162\n&gt;&gt; Orange and black, yeah.\n\n157\n00:06:50.162 --> 00:06:51.068\n&gt;&gt; And we'll keep that underline.\n\n158\n00:06:51.068 --> 00:06:53.633\n&gt;&gt; And I think he was kind of striped,\ntoo, so we could use that as well.\n\n159\n00:06:53.633 --> 00:06:56.441\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, this is just great.\n\n160\n00:06:56.441 --> 00:06:57.043\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It was\n\n161\n00:06:57.043 --> 00:06:57.621\nlike we did this on purpose.\n\n162\n00:06:57.621 --> 00:06:59.340\nWell, we didn't.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, no, we totally didn't.\n\n163\n00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.130\nWe did not plan this.\n\n164\n00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.375\n&gt;&gt; Straight off the cuff.\n\n165\n00:07:01.375 --> 00:07:02.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there are underline,\n\n166\n00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.890\nwe'll do a double underline style.\n\n167\n00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.690\nOr we could do, he did have the squiggly\nlines underneath them, didn't he?\n\n168\n00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.710\nHe had the little-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so.\n\n169\n00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.410\nIn his tail maybe.\n\n170\n00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.005\n&gt;&gt; Maybe.\nWe'll go with a double line.\n\n171\n00:07:14.005 --> 00:07:18.530\n[LAUGH] And I will make that color black,\nbecause I won't change the color to\n\n172\n00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.510\norange or something like that so.\n\n173\n00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.100\nWe'll click OK and now I have that\ndouble underlining effect on my text.\n\n174\n00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.870\nMoving over, we'll skip some\nof these buttons over here.\n\n175\n00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.590\nWe'll go right to the color because I\nreally wanna make this color orange.\n\n176\n00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.430\nThere is orange in the theme colors\nbecause right now I have an Office theme.\n\n177\n00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.600\nWe'll be getting into slide themes or\ndesign themes in a later episode.\n\n178\n00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.450\nBut right now,\nthe colors that you see will always be\n\n179\n00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.620\nbased off of whatever theme you\nhave applied to your slides.\n\n180\n00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.720\nAnd we have the Office theme so\nthat's the colors that we have.\n\n181\n00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.461\nBut we always have the options for\nmore colors.\n\n182\n00:07:54.461 --> 00:07:58.668\nThen the More Colors, this where you\nhave different options across the top\n\n183\n00:07:58.668 --> 00:08:00.959\nof where if I wanted to choose spectrum.\n\n184\n00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:02.350\nThat doesn't show me any color.\n\n185\n00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.543\nBecause you're on black right now.\n\n186\n00:08:03.543 --> 00:08:06.935\nYou have like an absence of light and\nso everything Like turned off,\n\n187\n00:08:06.935 --> 00:08:07.895\nif you want to say.\n\n188\n00:08:07.895 --> 00:08:11.354\nBut if you turn the lights on,\nyou take this slider down here and\n\n189\n00:08:11.354 --> 00:08:12.890\npull it over to white.\n\n190\n00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.220\nBecause we're, and when you're talking\nabout white, you're talking about light.\n\n191\n00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.260\nAnd we're doing a light spectrum here.\n\n192\n00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.710\nAnd then you can go ahead and find\nthe different colors that you would want.\n\n193\n00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.940\nBecause maybe there's a specific\ncolor of orange over here,\n\n194\n00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.670\nthat I want to choose for Garfield.\n\n195\n00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:30.310\nBut, going through some of the other\noptions in the color dialogue box,\n\n196\n00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.254\nof where you can pick colors.\n\n197\n00:08:32.254 --> 00:08:35.120\nYou have your RGB, you have your sliders.\n\n198\n00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.340\nAnd you have the different ways that\nyou can input in the color values,\n\n199\n00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.970\nwhether it's in a RGB, CMYK.\n\n200\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.580\nI think they have HSB, which is hue,\nsaturation and brightness.\n\n201\n00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.070\nIt's another way of measuring color.\n\n202\n00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.580\nAnd you also have the hex field down here,\nand a grayscale slider.\n\n203\n00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.000\nGrayscale slider is going to be\nexactly what it sounds like.\n\n204\n00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000\nIt's shades of gray,\nthere's no color in gray, so.\n\n205\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.210\nSo, if you needed to type\nin specific values for\n\n206\n00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.940\na color,\nthat is with a specific branded logo.\n\n207\n00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.090\nYou could go ahead and\ntype it in, in this place.\n\n208\n00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.330\nGoing through the other options.\n\n209\n00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.920\nWe also have the ones where\nit just shows the different\n\n210\n00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.660\nbasic colors within the Apple palette.\n\n211\n00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.160\nYou could also get your\nspectrum from here.\n\n212\n00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.780\nAnd then you have cute little pencils\nthat, when you hover over them,\n\n213\n00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.250\nthey kind of pull up a little bit.\n\n214\n00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.470\nI used to love colored pencils, so.\n\n215\n00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:27.180\nSo any of those different ways\nthat you want to select a color.\n\n216\n00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.910\nI'm gonna go with tangerine because that\nkind of looks like the Garfield color.\n\n217\n00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.640\n&gt;&gt; That's a great jazz song too.\n\n218\n00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.830\n&gt;&gt; Is it?\nWonderful.\n\n219\n00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:36.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n220\n00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.550\nVery entertaining tune.\n\n221\n00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.190\n&gt;&gt; Look it up, look it up.\n\n222\n00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.800\n&gt;&gt; I know, I will, I'm like?\n\n223\n00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.691\n&gt;&gt; My gift to you ladies, and gentlemen.\n\n224\n00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:44.783\n&gt;&gt;

That's kinda fun, I like that.\n\n241\n00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.170\nSo we were just picking a color\nfrom what it was giving us.\n\n242\n00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:38.590\nBut maybe I had a picture\nof Garfield on this slide.\n\n243\n00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.250\nOr a color, yeah,\nwe'll just go with Garfield.\n\n244\n00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.010\nGarfield was on this slide, and\n\n245\n00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.390\nI wanted to be able to actually pick\nout the color from that picture.\n\n246\n00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:52.340\nSelect, with the text selected,\nif i go back to the more colors.\n\n247\n00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.200\nThere's this little eye-dropper\nright here, that if i click it.\n\n248\n00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:01.560\nIt basically becomes a color selector\nfrom whatever it sees on my screen.\n\n249\n00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.310\nSo I move my mouse over around here,\neven if I move it up in here.\n\n250\n00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:09.200\nMaybe I wanted that particular\norange color within the ribbon, or\n\n251\n00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.340\nthe color of the title bar.\n\n252\n00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.790\nAnything that's on my screen,\nI can say, I want that color.\n\n253\n00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:19.870\nAnd if I click it, it becomes\nthe color that I will now say, yes,\n\n254\n00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.020\nI want when I click OK.\n\n255\n00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.980\nAnd now,\nit is formatted in that particular color.\n\n256\n00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.782\nSo I really like the color picker,\nI just think it's It's really handy.\n\n257\n00:11:27.782 --> 00:11:29.616\nThey've had this in Photoshop for\na long time.\n\n258\n00:11:29.616 --> 00:11:31.650\nSo kind of comes over into Office,\nI was like, yeah.\n\n259\n00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:35.159\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I have the Change Case for\n\n306\n00:13:37.194 --> 00:13:39.040\nmy character formats.\n\n307\n00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.730\nAnd then that's where you could go and\ndo all of this, do any of your text.\n\n308\n00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.700\nI could select, maybe I wanted\nthe word Alice to be bold, and\n\n309\n00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.850\nI wanted Alice to be Green.\n\n310\n00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.020\nAnd so, it's all about selective effect.\n\n311\n00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:57.130\nYou have to make sure that you have text\nselected, to where you want it to be.\n\n312\n00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:02.342\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH].\n\n316\n00:14:03.846 --> 00:14:04.771\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we lived through the '90s, man,\n\n317\n00:14:04.771 --> 00:14:05.283\nI remember it.\nAnd\n\n318\n00:14:05.283 --> 00:14:06.215\nit was just like that.\n[LAUGH]\n\n319\n00:14:06.215 --> 00:14:07.925\n&gt;&gt; Yes, big deal, big deal.\n\n320\n00:14:07.925 --> 00:14:09.328\nSo a few other smaller ones,\n\n321\n00:14:09.328 --> 00:14:13.530\nsuperscript and subscript.\nYou could say, Alice was drinking H2O, but\n\n322\n00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:17.320\nwe know that the 2 is\nsupposed to be subscripted.\n\n323\n00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.720\nSo we're going to go ahead and\nselect the letter 2.\n\n324\n00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.810\nAnd we will put that down to a subscript,\nand that puts the letter below.\n\n325\n00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:25.280\nPuts it below the baseline.\n\n326\n00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.980\nAnd then we have,\nthe four is two to the second, so\n\n327\n00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.840\nwe need to go ahead and\nmake that an exponent.\n\n328\n00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.230\nSo we need to make that a superscript.\n\n329\n00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:36.270\nSo you could go ahead and\nformat specific characters to be super or\n\n330\n00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.840\nsubscript as you need.\n\n331\n00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.340\nNow, what if I got to this?\n\n332\n00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.690\nAnd character format, I love Garfield,\n\n333\n00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.280\nbut I don't know if I\nwant any of that anymore.\n\n334\n00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.470\nI wanna just kind of remove\nall the formattings.\n\n335\n00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:49.700\nAnother one of my favorite buttons,\n\n336\n00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.350\nbecause a lot of times I get\nstuff that people have done.\n\n337\n00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.270\nI'm like, no, you need to change this.\n\n338\n00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.220\n&gt;&gt; This is bad. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe need to strip all of this out,\n\n339\n00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.890\nI just need the text.\n\n340\n00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:00.740\nSo I'm gonna select all\nthis text right here.\n\n341\n00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:05.081\nI did that triple-clicking to select\nall my text in that placeholder.\n\n342\n00:15:05.081 --> 00:15:09.680\nAnd we're gonna go to this button right\nhere, which is Clear All Formatting.\n\n343\n00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.810\nIt takes it back and then it sends\nit back to the default fonts.\n\n344\n00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:17.400\nWhich in this case, with this\nparticular thing, is our Calibri font.\n\n345\n00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.850\nAnd where am I going next?\n\n346\n00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:26.560\nI wanted to show something that I\nmeant to add in the Working With Text,\n\n347\n00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.770\nwhere we were entering\nin text to our slides.\n\n348\n00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.410\nAnd I didn't cover symbols.\n\n349\n00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:35.060\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I kept saying,\nour shortcut's Cmd+D, and\n\n350\n00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.310\nI, well, there is a symbol for Cmd.\n\n351\n00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:40.180\nIt's the little loopy, loopy loops.\n\n352\n00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:40.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, on a Mac.\n\n353\n00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.665\nThe Cmd key, or the key on the keyboard.\n\n354\n00:15:43.665 --> 00:15:44.430\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n355\n00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:45.570\nIt looks like a loopy loop.\n\n356\n00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.350\n&gt;&gt; The cloverleaf, they call it.\n\n357\n00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.710\nOr back in the day,\nthey called it cloverleaf, yeah.\n\n358\n00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.285\nExactly, it has a real name,\nand it's the loopy loop loop.\n\n359\n00:15:51.285 --> 00:15:52.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; The loopy loop loop key.\n\n360\n00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.380\n&gt;&gt; And there's the Yvonne name for it.\n\n361\n00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So, I wanna insert a symbol.\n\n362\n00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.388\nOr maybe I wanted to put a smiley face,\n\n363\n00:15:59.388 --> 00:16:03.263\nor something other than our\nregular text keys or numbers.\n\n364\n00:16:03.263 --> 00:16:04.801\nYou can insert symbols.\n\n365\n00:16:04.801 --> 00:16:08.535\nSo I'm going to take here Where I'm\ntaking the word command and\n\n366\n00:16:08.535 --> 00:16:11.830\nI want to replace that\nwith the actual symbol.\n\n367\n00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:13.190\nSo I'm going to select it.\n\n368\n00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:17.530\nI'm gonna come over here to insert\ncuz I'm inserting a symbol.\n\n369\n00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:21.920\nIt's over here toward the right and\nI'm going to say symbol and then,\n\n370\n00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.430\nit goes into, now you can see that it\ndoes have some some of motive fans and\n\n371\n00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:30.470\neverything if you kind of scroll through\nhere there is one that has loopy loop.\n\n372\n00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:34.266\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And I believe, is it gonna give us?\n\n373\n00:16:34.266 --> 00:16:40.463\nPlace of inter sign, okay, well then-\n&gt;&gt; Maybe that's where Microsoft comes up.\n\n374\n00:16:40.463 --> 00:16:42.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Otherwise that kind get's us both\n\n375\n00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.000\nalthough it doesn't say cleverly,\nbut that's all right.\n\n376\n00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.600\nYou know what?\n\n377\n00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.610\nWe know that that's a symbol that we\nwant to insert, so if I go ahead and\n\n378\n00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:53.560\ndouble click on it, you see how now it\ngoes ahead and puts in that symbol.\n\n379\n00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.880\nCuz there's a lot of times where\nyou do need to have symbols\n\n380\n00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.860\nto convey what you're saying and so,\nI definitely wanted to cover that.\n\n381\n00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:04.870\nAnd another thing is the way the I do\nlike a kind of like a progression.\n\n382\n00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:07.040\nLike, you go to format menu,\nthen you go to font.\n\n383\n00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.690\nI always do the dash and\nthen, the greater sign.\n\n384\n00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:15.380\nAnd, if you wanted, I could make that an\nactual arrow and so, I could go ahead and\n\n385\n00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.430\nselect that text.\n\n386\n00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.390\nI can go to symbol and then,\nI can make it an arrow.\n\n387\n00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:23.470\nIt's in the same group and\nthen, I have it look like that.\n\n388\n00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:29.000\nInsert Symbol, something I wanted to cover\nthat I feel like I just kinda, I forgot.\n\n389\n00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.750\n&gt;&gt; It's technically\ncalled a looped square.\n\n390\n00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.980\n&gt;&gt; Nice, looped square.\n\n391\n00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.270\n&gt;&gt; But\nApple has referred to it as the Apple key,\n\n392\n00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:42.460\nthe clover key, open Apple key,\nsplat key, pretzel key or propeller key.\n\n393\n00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.040\n&gt;&gt; Propellor.\n\n394\n00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.236\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz it looks like a propellor.\n\n395\n00:17:44.236 --> 00:17:45.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n396\n00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.050\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; I do remember the open apple and\n\n397\n00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:51.380\nthe closed apple back in my Apple II,\nI had an Apple II C.\n\n398\n00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:55.330\nAnd there was this game that it was\nlike apples that came across and\n\n399\n00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.540\nyou had to hit either one\ncuz one was an open apple,\n\n400\n00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.920\none was a closed apple,\nit was like a black and white apple.\n\n401\n00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.180\nAnd so, and they were either sides of\nthe keyboard and you had to hit one.\n\n402\n00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.700\nWhen it came over the little bucket and\n\n403\n00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.170\nif you hit it the right time it would\ndrop in the bucket and you'd get points.\n\n404\n00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.370\n&gt;&gt; I bet that was pretty fun actually.\n\n405\n00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:11.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those old eight bit games.\n\n406\n00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.210\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna download that on my phone.\n\n407\n00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:16.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm actually,\nnow I want to remember what it was called-\n\n408\n00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:16.610\n&gt;&gt; You can find it.\n\n409\n00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.470\n&gt;&gt; It was really fun.\n\n410\n00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:19.902\n&gt;&gt; The oracle of\nthe internet will tell us.\n\n411\n00:18:19.902 --> 00:18:20.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly,\n\n412\n00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:24.120\nall right so the character level formats.\n\n413\n00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:30.280\nI think we covered every button that is\non our font group on our home tab and\n\n414\n00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.570\nso, now we know how to create all of our\ndifferent character level formatting.\n\n415\n00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:37.730\nLet's go over here to slide four and\nlets talk about paragraph formatting.\n\n416\n00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:42.300\nI want to take this headings title and\nI want it to be centered in the slide.\n\n417\n00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.840\nNow, when you're talking about\nformatting paragraphs, you do not have\n\n418\n00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:51.310\nto select all of the text because all\nI have to do is put my cursor in here.\n\n419\n00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:57.160\nAnd if my cursor is in this title and\nI'm gonna use paragraph level formatting.\n\n420\n00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.910\nIt will format whatever\nparagraph that that is in.\n\n421\n00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:04.180\nSo, and you're more than welcome to\ngo ahead and select all the words in\n\n422\n00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.610\nthe paragraph if it makes you feel better,\nthat's fine, but you don't have to.\n\n423\n00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:11.400\nSo, I'm gonna put my cursor in\nthe paragraph that I want to center.\n\n424\n00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.870\nI come over here to our\nCenter Text button and then,\n\n425\n00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.180\nit goes ahead and centers that paragraph.\n\n426\n00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:22.690\nWhat if I wanted to take this paragraph\nand it is automatically left aligned,\n\n427\n00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:24.660\nmaybe I want it to be right aligned.\n\n428\n00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.980\nSo, cursor in the paragraph go ahead and\nclick the right-aligned button and then,\n\n429\n00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.250\nthat entire paragraph is right-aligned.\n\n430\n00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:36.920\nWe could also go ahead and do our full\njustification and that is justified text,\n\n431\n00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.730\nor full justification,\n\n432\n00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:42.830\nthe way my brain thinks of it when\nwe're talking about type setting.\n\n433\n00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:44.860\nFull justified text,\n\n434\n00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:49.000\nit's not a true full justification because\nif we were doing full justification,\n\n435\n00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.140\nit would actually take that last line and\njustify that across the entire line.\n\n436\n00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.350\nYou see that in newspapers,\nyou ever see that?\n\n437\n00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:57.060\nWhere like sometimes there's one\nword that stretches almost like\n\n438\n00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:57.760\nacross the entire column.\n\n439\n00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.890\n&gt;&gt; I think I've seen that.\n\n440\n00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:02.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or maybe like a couple words and\nit's just like really spaced out.\n\n441\n00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.550\n&gt;&gt; They want it look straight up and\ndown, right?\n\n442\n00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:07.140\n&gt;&gt; Because that's why it's\nfull justification and\n\n443\n00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:11.700\nin other programs you have control\nover how you justify the last line\n\n444\n00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:15.040\nversus all the rest of\nthe lines in the paragraph.\n\n445\n00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.590\nBut for PowerPoint it looks pretty nice\nwith the full justification and we don't\n\n446\n00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:22.270\nhave to worry about all the other settings\nthat you could do in other programs.\n\n447\n00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.770\nSo, some other things that we can do.\n\n448\n00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:28.830\nHere, I'm going to set this back\nto left align just, just because.\n\n449\n00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:33.210\nWe also have lines spacing and\nwhat that consists of,\n\n450\n00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:37.550\nis letting and, or space before and\nspace after paragraphs.\n\n451\n00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.840\nI'm going to go ahead and select all of\nthese paragraphs because in this sense, I\n\n452\n00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.520\nam selecting everything, or the paragraphs\nbecause I'm doing multiple paragraphs.\n\n453\n00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.190\nIf I was only wanting to do one,\nall I had to do was put my cursor in here.\n\n454\n00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.250\nBut I do wanna take the spacing for\nall of this and I'm going to come to\n\n455\n00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:56.331\nthis button right here at the, nope,\nthat's the wrong button, it's this one.\n\n456\n00:20:56.331 --> 00:21:01.124\n[LAUGH] I want the blue arrows up and\ndown and I'm going into my line spacing.\n\n457\n00:21:01.124 --> 00:21:05.950\nSo, if I chose, let's go with to, we'll do\ndouble space, like I want double spacing.\n\n458\n00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:10.300\nThis is what we're considering letting,\nthe space between all of our lines.\n\n459\n00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:16.410\nNow, because it has that auto fit, it is\ngoing to go ahead and make that spit down.\n\n460\n00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:21.060\nIf you need to like ahead and\nchange it into like a 14 point font, so\n\n461\n00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:26.300\nyou can see it's kind of adjusting, but it\nis gonna head in creating lines spacing or\n\n462\n00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.510\nspace between all of my lines,\nnot just between the paragraphs.\n\n463\n00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.840\nI'm going to take this back and\nput it to one, so\n\n464\n00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.620\nI want single space here and\nI'm also going to,\n\n465\n00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:43.550\nI'm going to create some other paragraphs\njust for demonstration purposes even.\n\n466\n00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:45.500\nYou'll see what I'm saying.\n\n467\n00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.830\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and select\nthis because I do wanna create space\n\n468\n00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:52.020\nafter paragraph, not between the lines.\n\n469\n00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:56.370\nIf I come over here to Line Spacing,\nthat is in the More options within this.\n\n470\n00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:01.840\nSo, Line Spacing Options, and here,\ndown here is where you Spacing.\n\n471\n00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.730\nFor some reason in PowerPoint and\n\n472\n00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:07.682\nsome of our other Office products it\nlikes to always put the space before.\n\n473\n00:22:07.682 --> 00:22:12.420\nThis is a personal preference, I don't\nlike putting space before paragraphs,\n\n474\n00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.560\nI like to do space after\nbecause if you think about it,\n\n475\n00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.190\nyou're travelling down if I'm\nformatting I'm usually formatting down.\n\n476\n00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:21.120\nSo, I don't like to think\nof anything in front of it.\n\n477\n00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.070\nThat's just me.\n\n478\n00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:23.870\nIt's totally up to you\nhow you want to do this.\n\n479\n00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.110\nBut I'm gonna take this before space.\n\n480\n00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:30.420\nI'm gonna put it to zero and then,\non the, I always forget this [LAUGH].\n\n481\n00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.550\nIf you don't put in the PT\nbecause they measure spacing and\n\n482\n00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:39.540\npoints here, it says that it's invalid, so\njust hit the bump arrows, as I call them.\n\n483\n00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:44.144\nJust hit the bumpy arrows down to where\nit gets to 0 PT for points and then,\n\n484\n00:22:44.144 --> 00:22:46.720\nif I want it after I can bump that up.\n\n485\n00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.350\nAnd if you do want to physically type\nin like 16 or something different,\n\n486\n00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:54.930\njust make sure that you keep the PT or\nthe points after it.\n\n487\n00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.780\nAnd then, you could also choose\nthe spacing from here if you wanted to.\n\n488\n00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.445\nI'm gonna keep it a single from\nwhat I had before, I click okay.\n\n489\n00:23:02.445 --> 00:23:08.115\nAnd do you see how now the spacing is\ncoming after each change in paragraph,\n\n490\n00:23:08.115 --> 00:23:10.530\nnot in every line.\n\n491\n00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:12.870\nWhichever way you want\nit to look is up to you.\n\n492\n00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:16.520\nAnd especially when we get into bullets,\nwhen we start formatting our bullets,\n\n493\n00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:23.230\nit's almost gonna be that line spacing and\nparagraph spacing is the same.\n\n494\n00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:27.550\nThat's only if you have bullets that only\noccupy a single line, that don't go and\n\n495\n00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:32.100\nactually do the automatic break,and\ngo down into the next line.\n\n496\n00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:35.750\nSo, it really just depends on how\nmuch stuff you've got in there.\n\n497\n00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:39.710\nLet's see, where are we gonna go next?\n\n498\n00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:44.600\nI wanted to, let's go ahead and\nclear the formatting on all of this.\n\n499\n00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.680\nAnd I just realized that it's only gonna\nclear the character formatting, so.\n\n500\n00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:49.180\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n501\n00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:50.340\n&gt;&gt; Why don't we go ahead and\n\n502\n00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:53.602\ntake this back?\nAnd we'll just take the space after Off,\n\n503\n00:23:53.602 --> 00:23:57.280\nremember I said, you've gotta do\nthe bumpy errors, there we go.\n\n504\n00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.174\nSo, we'll do zero and\n\n505\n00:23:59.174 --> 00:24:01.567\nnow I have some space here and\n\n506\n00:24:01.567 --> 00:24:06.377\nI wanted to put this into two columns.\nSo if I want to do columns, we can\n\n507\n00:24:06.377 --> 00:24:10.392\ncome over to this button right here.\nAnd I can go ahead and say, do I want two,\n\n508\n00:24:10.392 --> 00:24:12.428\nthree columns?\nLet's just go with two for\n\n509\n00:24:12.428 --> 00:24:14.980\nnow.\nAnd so now you see that it broke apart\n\n510\n00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.775\nthis space, this content place\nholder into two columns.\n\n511\n00:24:18.775 --> 00:24:20.731\nBut I like the columns, but\n\n512\n00:24:20.731 --> 00:24:24.684\nI want more space between them.\nThat's where if you go into\n\n513\n00:24:24.684 --> 00:24:29.053\nthe More Columns dialog box or options,\nthis is where you can go ahead and\n\n514\n00:24:29.053 --> 00:24:32.127\ndo this spacing between columns.\nAnd I can go ahead and\n\n515\n00:24:32.127 --> 00:24:35.323\nbump that up to maybe, I'll just\ngo with half an inch or click OK.\n\n516\n00:24:35.323 --> 00:24:38.235\nAnd see how now that space between\n\n517\n00:24:38.235 --> 00:24:42.089\nthe columns is going to\nshow up a lot better.\n\n518\n00:24:42.089 --> 00:24:44.332\nThe other thing we could do for\n\n519\n00:24:44.332 --> 00:24:47.940\nour paragraphs while\nforming is our indents.\n\n520\n00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.500\nI'm actually gonna come back over\nhere to slide three, just cuz I\n\n521\n00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:56.490\ndon't have as much paragraph level\nperformance on this particular slide.\n\n522\n00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:57.540\nSo we'll stay with this.\n\n523\n00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:04.670\nIndents, easiest way to do indents\nis to control it with your ruler.\n\n524\n00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:09.780\nIf you do not see the ruler up here,\nyou can go to the view tab on the ribbon,\n\n525\n00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:13.790\nand there is a check box for ruler.\n\n526\n00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:18.260\nSo if I check that on, or off, you can see\nit's gone, check it back on, it's back on.\n\n527\n00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:22.840\nSo, it's important because of\nthese characters right here.\n\n528\n00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.780\nThere is a triangle pointing down,\nthere is a triangle pointing up,\n\n529\n00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.750\nand there is a rectangle\nunderneath both of them.\n\n530\n00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:33.210\nWith my cursor in the paragraph\nthat I wanna format,\n\n531\n00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:38.360\nif you pull the top triangle in,\nthat is your first line indent.\n\n532\n00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.770\nHow does the first line get treated as\nopposed to where the rest of the text is\n\n533\n00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:44.036\ngoing to be located?\n\n534\n00:25:44.036 --> 00:25:47.960\nThe rectangle underneath it,\nthat moves both.\n\n535\n00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:52.885\nIf you now have changed, it doesn't matter\nif they're on top of each other or they're\n\n536\n00:25:52.885 --> 00:25:57.352\ndifferent if you move the rectangle you\nare now moving the entire left indent.\n\n537\n00:25:57.352 --> 00:26:00.631\nDepending on where and\nhow the first line is treated.\n\n538\n00:26:00.631 --> 00:26:06.923\nSo you can use those triangles on\nthe ribbon to indent your first line or\n\n539\n00:26:06.923 --> 00:26:12.696\ndo a hanging indent, go ahead and\nmove your entire left indent.\n\n540\n00:26:12.696 --> 00:26:15.719\nAnd so just really I sort of say,\nstart pulling one way or the other,\n\n541\n00:26:15.719 --> 00:26:16.525\nsee what it does.\n\n542\n00:26:16.525 --> 00:26:17.380\n&gt;&gt; Have a good time with it, right?\n\n543\n00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but the top is the first line.\n\n544\n00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:25.340\nThe second triangle is the hanging indent,\n\n545\n00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:28.900\nwhere in a second we'll see that's\nwhere the text start and the bullet.\n\n546\n00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:33.320\nAnd so that's where you could\nformat your indents on the ruler.\n\n547\n00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:38.020\nMoving on to our Bullets and\nNumbering, so here's our bullets.\n\n548\n00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.893\nI don't like the little dot,\nI want that to be different.\n\n549\n00:26:40.893 --> 00:26:43.582\nMaybe it wants to be\nlike a little check box,\n\n550\n00:26:43.582 --> 00:26:46.501\nmaybe I want the check box to be orange,\nright?\n\n551\n00:26:46.501 --> 00:26:50.220\nWe can have our orange and\nblack text going along with our Garfield.\n\n552\n00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:55.025\nSo I want to format all of these bullets\nso I'm going to go ahead and select them.\n\n553\n00:26:56.105 --> 00:27:00.455\nI'm then going to come over here to the\nHome, and then here's the bullets button.\n\n554\n00:27:00.455 --> 00:27:03.465\nThis is number, so if I did wanna choose\nthem in the numbering instead of bullets,\n\n555\n00:27:03.465 --> 00:27:04.985\nyou can go ahead and click that.\n\n556\n00:27:04.985 --> 00:27:08.000\nBut each one of them\nhas different options.\n\n557\n00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.739\nThe drop down next to it will go ahead and\n\n558\n00:27:10.739 --> 00:27:14.312\nallow you to choose\na different bullet character.\n\n559\n00:27:14.312 --> 00:27:15.400\nNow it gives you a couple of them.\n\n560\n00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.834\nBut maybe I don't want any of these,\nI want something different.\n\n561\n00:27:18.834 --> 00:27:22.090\nIn our previous show we saw some\nwith bunnies on there, right?\n\n562\n00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:25.040\nSo you can go into the Bullets and\nNumbering.\n\n563\n00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:29.900\nAnd then it has the options for\nyour different characters right here,\n\n564\n00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.970\nwithin the little flower.\n\n565\n00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:32.360\nAnd down at the bottom,\n\n566\n00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:36.180\nthat's where you could go all the way\nthrough your different emoji characters.\n\n567\n00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:40.466\nAnd then you can go into these different\nsymbols that you wanted to insert here.\n\n568\n00:27:40.466 --> 00:27:45.702\nSo we could go back to the,\nsomething square, the knotted square?\n\n569\n00:27:45.702 --> 00:27:46.488\n&gt;&gt; The looped square.\n\n570\n00:27:46.488 --> 00:27:48.884\n&gt;&gt; The looped square, yes [LAUGH].\n\n571\n00:27:48.884 --> 00:27:52.410\nSo we could go ahead and\nfind the looped square, there is is.\n\n572\n00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:57.180\nMaybe I want that to be my bullet\ncharacter, so I go ahead and find that.\n\n573\n00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.458\nAnd I want the bullet character\nto be a different color,\n\n574\n00:28:00.458 --> 00:28:03.893\nwell then you can come over here\nto the color of the bullet.\n\n575\n00:28:03.893 --> 00:28:06.448\nThe size, sometimes the bullet characters,\n\n576\n00:28:06.448 --> 00:28:09.012\nwhen you choose them\nthey're not big enough.\n\n577\n00:28:09.012 --> 00:28:12.725\nSo you can say like what percentage\nof the font do you want it to be, and\n\n578\n00:28:12.725 --> 00:28:16.459\nthen if you really wanted to you\ncould actually choose a photograph.\n\n579\n00:28:16.459 --> 00:28:19.054\nNow these bullets think about\na photograph as a picture or\n\n580\n00:28:19.054 --> 00:28:22.889\nelse the bullet's gonna be really really\nsmall, so you don't want like some really\n\n581\n00:28:22.889 --> 00:28:26.250\nornate photograph as your bullet\nit might get a little crazy.\n\n582\n00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:29.151\nSo I'm gonna choose that,\ngonna click okay but\n\n583\n00:28:29.151 --> 00:28:33.731\nyou see now how the text is really,\nreally close to that bullet character.\n\n584\n00:28:33.731 --> 00:28:36.570\nSo I want it to kind of\nmove off a little bit.\n\n585\n00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:37.482\n&gt;&gt; Give it some breathing room.\n\n586\n00:28:37.482 --> 00:28:40.240\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nwe need some breathing room right there.\n\n587\n00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.448\nSo that's where you want to take\nthe bottom triangle, not the top,\n\n588\n00:28:43.448 --> 00:28:45.147\ncuz that's where the bullet sits.\n\n589\n00:28:45.147 --> 00:28:49.214\nSo in this sense, the top triangle\nis where the bullet is, the bottom\n\n590\n00:28:49.214 --> 00:28:53.931\ntriangle is where the text is going to be\nrelated to that and so you see if I start.\n\n591\n00:28:53.931 --> 00:28:56.352\nWhoops, I grabbed the wrong one there,\nthis one.\n\n592\n00:28:56.352 --> 00:28:56.919\n&gt;&gt; Easy to do apparently.\n\n593\n00:28:56.919 --> 00:28:57.656\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n594\n00:28:57.656 --> 00:28:58.944\nIt's very, very close together.\n\n595\n00:28:58.944 --> 00:29:01.577\nSo make sure on the triangle pointing up.\n\n596\n00:29:01.577 --> 00:29:04.507\nAnd that way you see I can go ahead and\n\n597\n00:29:04.507 --> 00:29:08.917\nseparate the space between the text and\nthe bullets.\n\n598\n00:29:08.917 --> 00:29:11.930\nAnd then we can go ahead and\ndo something like that.\n\n599\n00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:15.151\nNow, I have this here.\n\n600\n00:29:15.151 --> 00:29:18.187\nAnd a lot of times, when we start getting\ninto bullet formatting in Powerpoint,\n\n601\n00:29:18.187 --> 00:29:20.703\neveryone's like, well,\nis this going to go for all of my slides?\n\n602\n00:29:20.703 --> 00:29:23.873\nCuz I have 65 slides\nthat have bullets on it.\n\n603\n00:29:23.873 --> 00:29:24.448\nNo.\n\n604\n00:29:24.448 --> 00:29:26.581\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not at this level, but\n\n605\n00:29:26.581 --> 00:29:29.544\nyou could do that in the slide master.\n\n606\n00:29:29.544 --> 00:29:32.182\nThe slide master is the place\nwhere everything kind of gets its\n\n607\n00:29:32.182 --> 00:29:33.000\nformatting from.\n\n608\n00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.230\nYou still need to know\nhow to format bullets.\n\n609\n00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.200\nBecause you need to know where it's at.\n\n610\n00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:41.110\nBut if you format it on the slide master,\nthen all the slides that have bullets will\n\n611\n00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:46.170\ngo ahead and obey that master and\nbe able to use that formatting.\n\n612\n00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:50.894\nBut for now, I really wanna take this and\ncopy this formatting to somewhere else.\n\n613\n00:29:50.894 --> 00:29:56.524\nAnd that's where the format\npainter can come in handy.\n\n614\n00:29:56.524 --> 00:30:01.004\nSo we can take our text now, the thing\nis you do need to make sure you select\n\n615\n00:30:01.004 --> 00:30:03.809\nthe entire paragraph, meaning all of this.\n\n616\n00:30:03.809 --> 00:30:08.165\nBecause the bullet character is part of\nthat paragraph and the format is like,\n\n617\n00:30:08.165 --> 00:30:11.269\nits kind of like painting\na house you have a can of paint.\n\n618\n00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:14.163\nYou take the paint brush, you put it in\na can of paint and then you take it and\n\n619\n00:30:14.163 --> 00:30:15.310\npaint on the house.\n\n620\n00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:20.723\nSo we're basically saying here we select\nthis text that this is the can of paint.\n\n621\n00:30:20.723 --> 00:30:24.651\nI'm gonna get my paintbrush,\nwhich is right here on the Home tab.\n\n622\n00:30:24.651 --> 00:30:26.369\nI'm going to click it and so\n\n623\n00:30:26.369 --> 00:30:31.536\nnow it's saying that I've got the paint\non the paintbrush from that can of paint.\n\n624\n00:30:31.536 --> 00:30:36.336\nAnd if I click hold and drag over here,\ndo you see how that will go ahead and\n\n625\n00:30:36.336 --> 00:30:38.482\ncopy the formatting from that.\n\n626\n00:30:38.482 --> 00:30:43.731\nNot the text, it's just the formats of it,\nand then it goes ahead and applies.\n\n627\n00:30:43.731 --> 00:30:44.955\nAnd notice it's gone.\n\n628\n00:30:44.955 --> 00:30:47.060\nIt's like a one-time thing.\n\n629\n00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:51.811\nIf you wanted it to stay on, like\nthe whole time, I'm gonna come back here,\n\n630\n00:30:51.811 --> 00:30:55.008\nif you double-click\nthe format painter there is,\n\n631\n00:30:55.008 --> 00:30:57.785\nwhere it kind of keeps\nthe gun on as I call it.\n\n632\n00:30:57.785 --> 00:31:00.248\nIt's kind of like the spray gun\nthat you can spray houses with.\n\n633\n00:31:00.248 --> 00:31:05.150\nIf you double click it, then I can go\nahead and select here, I can select here.\n\n634\n00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:08.280\nAnd then sometimes and\nit's like I could select here and okay,\n\n635\n00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.480\nnow I'm getting a little too crazy.\n\n636\n00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.360\nIt's like it's scrolling everywhere.\n\n637\n00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:15.470\nIt's like if you turn the gun on,\nyou can turn the gun off.\n\n638\n00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:19.350\nSo you have to come back up\nhere to the paintbrush and\n\n639\n00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:23.060\nturn it off to say all right,\nI'm done copying.\n\n640\n00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:27.415\nNow, I have a few other things that I want\nto show, cuz I said all about the tabs,\n\n641\n00:31:27.415 --> 00:31:29.400\nhow much I love to format tabs.\n\n642\n00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.655\nBut I can see you're kind\nof giving me the, hey,\n\n643\n00:31:31.655 --> 00:31:33.311\nwe're starting to run out of time.\n\n644\n00:31:33.311 --> 00:31:37.223\nSo, I think we might go ahead and\njust make a small part two out of this and\n\n645\n00:31:37.223 --> 00:31:40.825\ncome back to show you about all\nthe wonderful world the tab stops.\n\n646\n00:31:40.825 --> 00:31:42.967\nAnd then also how we're going\nto formating our speaker nets.\n\n647\n00:31:42.967 --> 00:31:43.835\n&gt;&gt; That sounds fantastic.\n\n648\n00:31:43.835 --> 00:31:45.186\nIt's a great idea.\n\n649\n00:31:45.186 --> 00:31:47.909\nWe don't want to overwhelm\nyou good people.\n\n650\n00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:49.288\nWe don't want you drinking\nfrom a fire hose, right?\n\n651\n00:31:49.288 --> 00:31:52.188\nSo we'll just break this\ninto a small part two, and\n\n652\n00:31:52.188 --> 00:31:54.422\nwe'll finish that up in that episode.\n\n653\n00:31:54.422 --> 00:31:56.071\nSo definitely join us in for that.\n\n654\n00:31:56.071 --> 00:31:58.494\nVonne, thanks for\ngetting to where we are at so far.\n\n655\n00:31:58.494 --> 00:32:00.240\nCan't wait to see where you're\ngonna take us in the next show.\n\n656\n00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.831\nSo we'll be there for that one.\n\n657\n00:32:01.831 --> 00:32:05.398\nAs far as this episode goes,\nwe need to shut it down.\n\n658\n00:32:05.398 --> 00:32:07.938\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n659\n00:32:07.938 --> 00:32:08.690\n&gt;&gt; I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n660\n00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:10.700\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n661\n00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:16.631\n[MUSIC]\n\n662\n00:32:16.631 -->

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; You're okay.\n\n43\n00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:05.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, not at all.\n\n44\n00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.450\nI know where you're at.\n\n45\n00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.009\nAnd so once I learned how to do it,\nit kind of just opened my world up.\n\n46\n00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n47\n00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.220\n&gt;&gt; And now I love to make some tab stops.\n\n48\n00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.720\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n49\n00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.848\n&gt;&gt; So well, I have tabs here\n\n50\n00:02:16.848 --> 00:02:18.012\n&gt;&gt; As I said it before,\n\n51\n00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:21.982\nyou can't see the hidden characters\nlike you can were those little,\n\n52\n00:02:21.982 --> 00:02:24.447\nit looks like a paragraph\nbutton in Word and\n\n53\n00:02:24.447 --> 00:02:25.670\nyou can click it.\nAnd\n\n54\n00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.672\nit will show you every time that you've\nspaced, anytime that you've tabbed,\n\n55\n00:02:29.672 --> 00:02:34.850\nline returns, character returns, hard line\nbreaks, all of those kinds of things.\n\n56\n00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.950\nSo you're just gonna have to trust\nme that there are tabs here.\n\n57\n00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.550\nThe other way that you're gonna know\nwhether or not this format is tabs is you\n\n58\n00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.390\nstart putting on tabs stops and\nit doesn't do anything.\n\n59\n00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.110\nThen there's no tabs.\n\n60\n00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.520\nSo that's one thing I know\nthat this has tabs in it and\n\n61\n00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.750\nevery word has a tab after it.\n\n62\n00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.230\nSo first tab First tab, Last tab,Title,\n\n63\n00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.720\nEnter, same thing with the next lines, so\neach ones of them, they don't line up.\n\n64\n00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.470\nAnd we had talked about how tabs but\n\n65\n00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.730\nautomatically they stop at every\nhalf inch mark on the ruler.\n\n66\n00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.550\nAnd so if your words are longer or\ngo past that first automatic tab stop,\n\n67\n00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.790\nlike my word Vonne goes past that first\nhalf inch mark then my tab goes to\n\n68\n00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.740\nthe next default tab stop which would be\nthe next half inch mark on the ruler.\n\n69\n00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.090\nAnd so I want to make it where every one\nof these tabs line up next to each other.\n\n70\n00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.270\nSo I'm gonna say,\ndon't do the automatic tabbing.\n\n71\n00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.523\nI want you to listen to me,\nat where I'm telling you where to stop.\n\n72\n00:03:40.523 --> 00:03:44.680\nAnd then when you stop,\nhow are you going to align?\n\n73\n00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.050\nDo I left align you?\n\n74\n00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.410\nDo I center align you?\n\n75\n00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.130\nIf you were doing things with budgets and\nyou had numbers,\n\n76\n00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.810\nif you had money values,\nyou have like 0.00,\n\n77\n00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.900\nyou have your due decimal places,\nyou can then align at decimals as well.\n\n78\n00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.900\nSo there's a million of things you can do.\n\n79\n00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.630\nI do need to select all of the paragraphs\nthat I want to format because you can have\n\n80\n00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.760\ndifferent tab stops for\n\n81\n00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.740\ndifferent paragraphs because it\nis a paragraph level format.\n\n82\n00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.400\nSo you gotta make sure that you\ngot all the paragraphs you want.\n\n83\n00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.657\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nselect all these paragraphs here.\n\n84\n00:04:13.657 --> 00:04:16.380\nIt's all about the ruler.\n\n85\n00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.266\nUp here on the ruler that if we don't\nhave, we can go to the View tab and\n\n86\n00:04:20.266 --> 00:04:21.606\ngo ahead and turn it on.\n\n87\n00:04:21.606 --> 00:04:24.420\nYou don't click any of the triangles.\n\n88\n00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.920\nYou just kind of find where\ndo you want the tab to stop.\n\n89\n00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.867\nAnd I'm just gonna pick kind of\nrandomly in between 2 and 3.\n\n90\n00:04:31.867 --> 00:04:33.180\nAnd all you gotta do is click.\n\n91\n00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.370\nIf I just click once it goes ahead and\n\n92\n00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.230\nputs this tiny little line with an arrow\nthat indicates that this is left align and\n\n93\n00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.420\nso you can see that it's tab and\nthen stop right here.\n\n94\n00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.570\nI'm gonna click and\nhold on this tab stop to see and\n\n95\n00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.000\nif I drag it this is also the way like,\nmm, I need to move it a little bit along.\n\n96\n00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.440\nAnd I wanted to kind of\nshow you that when I let go\n\n97\n00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.240\non the two inch right here on the ruler\nIt moves exactly to that point.\n\n98\n00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.585\nThis is the first place, this is the place\nwhere the first tab is going to stop, yay.\n\n99\n00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:06.741\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's go on to the next.\n\n100\n00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:08.782\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic.\n\n101\n00:05:08.782 --> 00:05:09.862\nSo let's go not to the next one.\n\n102\n00:05:09.862 --> 00:05:11.564\nI'm gonna somewhere around the 4.\n\n103\n00:05:11.564 --> 00:05:13.870\nBetween 4 and 5, I'm gonna click.\n\n104\n00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.540\nAnd then it goes ahead and that's\nwhere the next Tab is going to stop.\n\n105\n00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.661\n&gt;&gt; That's very nice.\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n106\n00:05:18.661 --> 00:05:19.373\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n107\n00:05:19.373 --> 00:05:20.456\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do too.\n\n108\n00:05:20.456 --> 00:05:21.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Isn't it fun?\n\n109\n00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.630\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n&gt;&gt; That's where we see people that's how\n\n110\n00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.430\nthat works.\n\n111\n00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.461\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well cuz this can be so\nfrustrating to try and\n\n112\n00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:30.950\nget everything lined up and you're\nworking with it and you're doing things.\n\n113\n00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.925\nAnd you might get to where you wanna be\nbut it took a lot of work to get there.\n\n114\n00:05:34.925 --> 00:05:35.430\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n115\n00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.518\n&gt;&gt; That's a whole lot easier than,\nI'm not going to lie to you here.\n\n116\n00:05:38.518 --> 00:05:39.603\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, great,\n\n117\n00:05:39.603 --> 00:05:42.610\nI'm glad you can see\nthe beauty of a tab stop.\n\n118\n00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.810\nIt sometimes takes a while, so if you're\nnot getting it right now, if you're like,\n\n119\n00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:46.950\nI don't see it, it's all right.\n\n120\n00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.380\nIt's fine, just keep trying.\n\n121\n00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.488\nNow, the alignment of where\nthe tabs are going to align.\n\n122\n00:05:52.488 --> 00:05:54.226\nThey're all left-align by default.\n\n123\n00:05:54.226 --> 00:05:59.430\nI wanna change, maybe I want\nthat title to be right aligned.\n\n124\n00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.680\nAnd how do I do that?\n\n125\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.785\nIf you double-click right on the tab.\n\n126\n00:06:02.785 --> 00:06:05.590\nNow this is where you gotta be\nvery careful where your mouse is.\n\n127\n00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.254\nI wanna make sure I'm\nright over that tab stop.\n\n128\n00:06:07.254 --> 00:06:09.160\nAnd I click, click, double-click.\n\n129\n00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.130\nIt actually brings up\nthe tabs dialogue box.\n\n130\n00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.850\nAnd this is where it's showing me,\n\n131\n00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.540\nI thought I was right at the 2\ninch mark it was actually 1.99.\n\n132\n00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.470\nBut that's where this tab stop is.\n\n133\n00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.920\nI wanted that's second tab\nstop to be right aligned.\n\n134\n00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.398\nThe thing you got to remember and\nthis is always right I just go ahead and\n\n135\n00:06:26.398 --> 00:06:29.311\njust there is right I click right and\nI click OK, it doesn't do anything, why?\n\n136\n00:06:29.311 --> 00:06:32.704\nOver here I have multiple tab stops,\n\n137\n00:06:32.704 --> 00:06:38.067\nI have to make sure I select\nthe tab stop that I want to format\n\n138\n00:06:38.067 --> 00:06:43.480\nthe alignment first, and\nI always forget that, always.\n\n139\n00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.900\n&gt;&gt; Always, every time.\n&gt;&gt; I'm going too fast.\n\n140\n00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.844\nI'm, I wanna go, and I'm like no, no.\n\n141\n00:06:46.844 --> 00:06:49.875\nSo, I'm trying to tell you and\nemphasize something that I always do.\n\n142\n00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:52.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Choose a tab stop first.\n\n143\n00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:53.880\nAnd so, you could see right there.\n\n144\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.876\nAnd then you can go ahead and\nright align that particular tab stop.\n\n145\n00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:00.679\nNow, I we'll go ahead and\nmake a small correction,\n\n146\n00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:02.860\na little asterisk I guess you could say.\n\n147\n00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.467\nCuz I told you that it was default\nat every half inch, didn't I?\n\n148\n00:07:06.467 --> 00:07:07.340\n&gt;&gt; I think you did.\n\n149\n00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.619\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, that's in Word.\n\n150\n00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:10.904\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n151\n00:07:10.904 --> 00:07:13.835\n&gt;&gt; So-\n&gt;&gt; Easy to get, it's a Microsoft product,\n\n152\n00:07:13.835 --> 00:07:14.620\nwho's to say?\n\n153\n00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then I just realized when-\n&gt;&gt; Except for it's different here.\n\n154\n00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.568\n&gt;&gt; And then, yeah, then when I open it up,\nI'm like it's actually everyone into.\n\n155\n00:07:20.568 --> 00:07:22.448\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But this is in PowerPoint, so\n\n156\n00:07:22.448 --> 00:07:23.510\nin PowerPoint.\n\n157\n00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:28.190\nBut regardless if it's every half\ninch in Word, or it's every one inch\n\n158\n00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.460\nin PowerPoint, the same rule,\nI guess you could say, applies, is that.\n\n159\n00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.170\nThere's a default tab position on\nthe ruler and if you go past it.\n\n160\n00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.040\nSo everything I said before is the same,\nI just forgot that we were in PowerPoint.\n\n161\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.871\n&gt;&gt; Just that one little caveat.\n\n162\n00:07:40.871 --> 00:07:44.898\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was thinking about Word and\nother products I do out of habit,\n\n163\n00:07:44.898 --> 00:07:47.200\nsorry about that, but that's okay.\n\n164\n00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.770\nWe know now.\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, now we're corrected, right?\n\n165\n00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.693\nSo everyone's right again, sweet.\n\n166\n00:07:50.693 --> 00:07:51.528\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, so\n\n167\n00:07:51.528 --> 00:07:55.570\nI have a right aligned tab stop on\nthis particular point on the ruler.\n\n168\n00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.360\nI could go ahead and\nchange if I wanted to.\n\n169\n00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.256\nIf I wanted to go ahead and make it\nexactly 5 inches, I could go ahead and\n\n170\n00:08:02.256 --> 00:08:03.247\nchange that.\n\n171\n00:08:03.247 --> 00:08:08.590\nAnd that's not working, so\nlet's go ahead and bump that up.\n\n172\n00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.210\nAnd we'll go ahead and set it.\n\n173\n00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:10.790\nYou know what?\n\n174\n00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.640\nI just realized, [LAUGH] I'm\ngoing a little off the grid here.\n\n175\n00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.380\nI just made another tab stop.\n\n176\n00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.060\nYou know what?\n\n177\n00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.910\nI don't want that one, so\nI'm gonna go ahead and clear that.\n\n178\n00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.450\nSee if I can clear that one,\nI can go ahead and move that.\n\n179\n00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:26.680\nHonestly, I would just go ahead and change\nit on the ruler, but if you wanted to be\n\n180\n00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.810\nexact, you could come up here, and\nyou can set that as, whoops, over here.\n\n181\n00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:35.470\nHere right, now I'm okay, we click,\nOK, and now you go ahead and\n\n182\n00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:40.833\nsee that it is on the right aligned-\n&gt;&gt; Right side.\n\n183\n00:08:40.833 --> 00:08:41.704\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n184\n00:08:41.704 --> 00:08:42.924\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Starting to spin a little bit.\n\n185\n00:08:42.924 --> 00:08:46.570\nAll right, so that's where you can\ngo ahead and move your tabs stops.\n\n186\n00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.310\nNow what if I've formatted tab stops and\nI don't want them anymore?\n\n187\n00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.470\nI don't want any of the formats.\n\n188\n00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.330\nIf you can put a tabs up on the ruler\nyou can take it off the ruler.\n\n189\n00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.070\nIt's kind like a magnet on the\nrefrigerator you just pull it right off,\n\n190\n00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.370\nsame thing here.\n\n191\n00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.480\nSo left on the paragraph that\nhave formated tab stops and\n\n192\n00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.080\nI don't want that anymore I can just take\nthis and click a hold and drag down.\n\n193\n00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.320\nAnd you see how it actually gives\nme a little visual like nope\n\n194\n00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.180\nwe don't want that anymore and\nthen goes away.\n\n195\n00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.490\nAnd notice how because there still\nis a tab stop that first tab that\n\n196\n00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:22.260\nI make is now aligning with that\nfirst one that I have on the ruler.\n\n197\n00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.760\nIf I then go ahead and grab that and\ndrag it off it goes away and\n\n198\n00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.070\nthen I can remove tab stops from the ones\nthat already have it if I need to.\n\n199\n00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:35.700\nSo lots of little areas, it does take\na little bit to kind of get familiar\n\n200\n00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.600\nwith this and really understand it but\nonce you do it I really think it can help.\n\n201\n00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.100\nSo that's what we got with our tab stops.\n\n202\n00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.410\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nnow we know how to work with tabs.\n\n203\n00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:48.050\nThey're not so devious little devils\nout there trying to ruin our lives and\n\n204\n00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.290\nmake work hard for us.\n\n205\n00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.750\nNow we know how to make them work\nwith us instead of against us.\n\n206\n00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.043\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, exactly,\nthat is the name of the game, Tim.\n\n207\n00:09:54.043 --> 00:09:54.680\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n208\n00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.150\n&gt;&gt; So the next thing I want to talk\nabout is formating your speaker notes.\n\n209\n00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.380\nBecause we've been formatting all\nof our text on our slides but\n\n210\n00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.980\nwhat about the notes for me as\na presenter if I'm printing them out and\n\n211\n00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.810\nlooking at them while I'm\nmaking my presentation.\n\n212\n00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.180\nI might want that text to look formatted.\n\n213\n00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.180\nMaybe I want a different font,\n\n214\n00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.100\ndifferent size, I wanna make my\nown bullets in my own notes.\n\n215\n00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:15.775\nSo let me show how to do that.\n\n216\n00:10:15.775 --> 00:10:19.431\n&gt;&gt; So are you saying that my vomit my\nthoughts out on to the speaker notes\n\n217\n00:10:19.431 --> 00:10:22.980\nsystem of thought is probably\nnot the best way to go about it?\n\n218\n00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.371\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean,\nwe could have controlled vomit?\n\n219\n00:10:25.371 --> 00:10:26.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, okay.\n&gt;&gt; We can make it prettier,\n\n220\n00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.571\nhow about that?\n\n221\n00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:28.681\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n222\n00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:31.399\nwe can make it a little\nbit more organized.\n\n223\n00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:33.857\nOkay let's go here to slide number four.\n\n224\n00:10:33.857 --> 00:10:38.500\nBecause I do have here some speaker notes,\nI know that because I made these slides.\n\n225\n00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.200\nBut I don't see them you gotta come down\nhere this status bar and be able to show\n\n226\n00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.970\nyou notes and so I have them hidden just\nto kinda re-emphasize the button as well.\n\n227\n00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.915\n&gt;&gt; Don't forget to save.\n&gt;&gt; Yes and I actually did a,\n\n228\n00:10:48.915 --> 00:10:53.790\nI forgot I was supposed to remove some\nof that formatting before I say this but\n\n229\n00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.710\nin mind I was go through here.\n\n230\n00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:59.832\nSo what can I format in our\nspeaker notes in normal view.\n\n231\n00:10:59.832 --> 00:11:03.960\nHint, hint right there,\nwe're in normal view..\n\n232\n00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.130\nI can do some basic format in here.\n\n233\n00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.280\nI can make things bold,\nI can make it italic.\n\n234\n00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.380\nYou can see that I actually have things\nformatted as bullets in here aswell, and\n\n235\n00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:18.390\nyou can still use your tab and shift tab\nwhen we would talk about adding text.\n\n236\n00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:24.270\nIf I'm here with this formatted as bullet,\nif I hit Enter I'm on the same level and\n\n237\n00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.970\nthen, if I hit,\noops let's pretend I can spell correctly.\n\n238\n00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.830\nIf I then use my shift tab\nthen I can go ahead and\n\n239\n00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:34.640\nmake another point out here and\nyou can go ahead and do the entering\n\n240\n00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.430\nin text as a bulleted list the same way\nthat you can do in your speaker notes.\n\n241\n00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:43.100\nAnd you can go ahead and\nformat as bullets.\n\n242\n00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.900\nFor example, if I select all of these\nparagraphs and these lines that I\n\n243\n00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.940\nwanted to create into bullets I can\nthen go ahead and use my bullet button.\n\n244\n00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:56.142\nOr I can make into my numbered list and\nyou can also go ahead and change and\n\n245\n00:11:56.142 --> 00:11:57.415\nformat the bullets.\n\n246\n00:11:57.415 --> 00:12:00.643\nJust like you would in\na slide you can go ahead and\n\n247\n00:12:00.643 --> 00:12:06.610\nformat your bullets in your speaker notes\ntwo degree, I'll get there in a second.\n\n248\n00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:10.140\nSo the basic format, let's take this\nformatting text in speaker notes.\n\n249\n00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.570\nI'm gonna make this bold,\nmaybe I wanna it italic.\n\n250\n00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.620\nAnd I can see all of those things.\n\n251\n00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:21.900\nSo very basic almost like rich text\nformatting type of options, so\n\n252\n00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:22.950\nit does all that.\n\n253\n00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.470\nBut I wanna change the font.\n\n254\n00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:28.440\nSo I come up here, I wanna go to that\nGarfield font that we were using and\n\n255\n00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.820\nI wanna make it 44 points.\n\n256\n00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.002\nAnd you're like, why do you keep talking\ncuz it's not doing anything is it?\n\n257\n00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:33.833\n&gt;&gt; Not doing a dang thing.\n\n258\n00:12:33.833 --> 00:12:34.992\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not.\n\n259\n00:12:34.992 --> 00:12:41.335\nWell, kind of, you just don't see it,\nbecause we're in normal view right now.\n\n260\n00:12:41.335 --> 00:12:43.105\n&gt;&gt; So we have to go into that\npresenter mode or whatever, right?\n\n261\n00:12:43.105 --> 00:12:44.894\nThat's what I'm guessing.\n\n262\n00:12:44.894 --> 00:12:45.682\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n263\n00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:48.826\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's okay to tell me no.\n\n264\n00:12:48.826 --> 00:12:49.337\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n265\n00:12:49.337 --> 00:12:51.651\nwe will be getting to those preventer,\npreventer?\n\n266\n00:12:51.651 --> 00:12:52.151\n&gt;&gt; Preventer methods.\n&gt;&gt; Presenter modes.\n\n267\n00:12:52.151 --> 00:12:53.417\n&gt;&gt; You can't see these slides,\n\n268\n00:12:53.417 --> 00:12:57.016\nI'm preventing her.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm glad you even said that,\n\n269\n00:12:57.016 --> 00:13:00.449\nwrong place, but\nwe will be coming back to it.\n\n270\n00:13:00.449 --> 00:13:01.087\n&gt;&gt; So this is a whole\n\n271\n00:13:01.087 --> 00:13:05.018\nnew area we haven't even seen yet then.\nI went through it a little bit,\n\n272\n00:13:05.018 --> 00:13:07.533\nI don't know.\nI think we did it in the-\n\n273\n00:13:07.533 --> 00:13:09.273\n&gt;&gt; I'm all on the edge of my seat at this\n\n274\n00:13:09.273 --> 00:13:11.054\npoint.\n[LAUGH]\n\n275\n00:13:11.054 --> 00:13:12.976\n&gt;&gt; When we were going to the environment\n\n276\n00:13:12.976 --> 00:13:14.310\nwe did talk about this.\n\n277\n00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:17.120\nWe went to our View tab because\nthere are different ways to view.\n\n278\n00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.590\nAnd we talked about our status bar down\nhere while we have our normal view.\n\n279\n00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:24.860\nWe have our slides order of view and then\nwe had our play from the presentation,\n\n280\n00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:25.580\nour slide show.\n\n281\n00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.390\nBut then we also talked about in\nthe ribbon there is the view tab because\n\n282\n00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:33.410\nthere are other views, such as, the-\n&gt;&gt; Notes paged.\n\n283\n00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.370\n&gt;&gt; Da, da, da, da!\n\n284\n00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:38.330\nThere now we've made it to where\nI did make it cooper black and\n\n285\n00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:43.690\nI did make it a different, I made it\nitalic, I made it a different font size.\n\n286\n00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:44.370\nIt is there.\n\n287\n00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.375\n&gt;&gt; And can you edit from this this\nview I mean obvious I think you would.\n\n288\n00:13:47.375 --> 00:13:48.710\n&gt;&gt; And you can.\n\n289\n00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:51.010\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that would be really\ndifficult to be adding things and\n\n290\n00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:52.598\ngo, I hope this looks good.\n\n291\n00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:57.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes and that's exactly right.\n\n292\n00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.360\nSo I can go ahead and in my NotesView or\n\n293\n00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:05.500\nNotes Page View, I can format my notes\nwith all the same things that I was doing.\n\n294\n00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.420\nI can make it orange,\nlet's make it our Garfield text.\n\n295\n00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.278\nI can go ahead and make it underlined.\n\n296\n00:14:09.278 --> 00:14:11.630\nAnd I can make my bullets.\n\n297\n00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.880\nI could go ahead and\nformat my bullet characters.\n\n298\n00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.091\nAll of the, as I call advanced,\nit's not really advanced.\n\n299\n00:14:17.091 --> 00:14:19.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Advanced formatting, it does show and\n\n300\n00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.060\nyou can do that to your speaker notes.\n\n301\n00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.670\nBut if you're gonna see\nthose advanced formattings,\n\n302\n00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:28.090\nyou do need to be in the notes view and\nit will print this way.\n\n303\n00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.130\nIf you have a color printer cuz if\nyou don't have a color printer,\n\n304\n00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:32.180\nit'll print in black and white.\n\n305\n00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:37.000\nBut I mean, whatever you format it\nto look like in your notes view,\n\n306\n00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.180\nthat's how it will print.\n\n307\n00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.873\nBut it won't show that in presenter view.\n\n308\n00:14:41.873 --> 00:14:44.487\nSo by you saying, that I-\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n309\n00:14:44.487 --> 00:14:45.484\n&gt;&gt; I wanna say preventor.\n\n310\n00:14:45.484 --> 00:14:49.053\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Presenter, the presenter view.\n\n311\n00:14:49.053 --> 00:14:53.981\nIf I go ahead and run this slide show from\nthe current slide you can see that you\n\n312\n00:14:53.981 --> 00:14:58.601\nsee the slide but I'm gonna flip it\nover because my Mac is showing that it\n\n313\n00:14:58.601 --> 00:15:01.265\nsee two monitors, the way we work here.\n\n314\n00:15:01.265 --> 00:15:06.224\nSo if I swap the displays, now you guys\ncan see that in the presenter notes,\n\n315\n00:15:06.224 --> 00:15:09.460\nthat's not bulleted-\n&gt;&gt; Garfield text.\n\n316\n00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.790\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we don't have the Garfield text.\n\n317\n00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:15.350\nSo it will only show the basic formatting,\nlike you see in the normal view.\n\n318\n00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.545\nThat's what the presenter\nview will show you.\n\n319\n00:15:18.545 --> 00:15:23.222\nSo but, it is nice to know that your\nspeaker notes can be as beautiful\n\n320\n00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:26.190\nas you want it to be and\nyou can format them.\n\n321\n00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.790\nIt really just depends on\nwhat you want to do and\n\n322\n00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.990\nwhat you need to have as your notes.\n\n323\n00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:35.969\nAnd sometimes, highlighting something in\na red text, like don't forget to say this,\n\n324\n00:15:35.969 --> 00:15:38.206\nthat can be really helpful for you too.\n\n325\n00:15:38.206 --> 00:15:41.860\n&gt;&gt; So, this is really only for\nif you're gonna print out your notes.\n\n326\n00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.550\nBecause you're not gonna see\nit in present mode at all, and\n\n327\n00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.830\nif you're in the normal view,\nyou're kind of editing what you do.\n\n328\n00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you are really-\n&gt;&gt; This is where I need a nice for\n\n329\n00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.985\nmyself, when I'm standing at a podium\nI've got, actual pretty enough for me.\n\n330\n00:15:54.985 --> 00:15:55.815\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n331\n00:15:55.815 --> 00:15:57.550\n&gt;&gt; I'm with you, I'm I'm learning stuff.\n\n332\n00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:58.215\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n333\n00:15:58.215 --> 00:15:59.035\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, and\n\n334\n00:15:59.035 --> 00:16:01.885\nI think I mean we've\ndone a lot of formatting.\n\n335\n00:16:01.885 --> 00:16:03.515\n&gt;&gt; We have.\n&gt;&gt; And so I think we've covered\n\n336\n00:16:03.515 --> 00:16:04.925\nall the bases that I wanted to cover.\n\n337\n00:16:04.925 --> 00:16:07.525\n&gt;&gt; Excellent stuff, Vonne,\nit's very cool stuff.\n\n338\n00:16:07.525 --> 00:16:11.055\nWho would have through PowerPoint is so\nrich and feature-full.\n\n339\n00:16:11.055 --> 00:16:14.420\nIt apparently is, it's got a lot of\ncool stuff going on underneath the hood.\n\n340\n00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.000\nSo play with these different things,\n\n341\n00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.490\nmake things look the way that will work\nbest for you in your environment and\n\n342\n00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.930\nyour application and\nit could really help you out.\n\n343\n00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.386\nYou never know when,\nI need that Garfield text.\n\n344\n00:16:24.386 --> 00:16:25.005\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n345\n00:16:25.005 --> 00:16:27.750\n&gt;&gt; And I need to print it out and\nnow I know how to do that.\n\n346\n00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.092\nIt's now at your ready.\n\n347\n00:16:29.092 --> 00:16:30.356\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So cool stuff for\n\n348\n00:16:30.356 --> 00:16:31.455\nus to put in our toolbox.\n\n349\n00:16:31.455 --> 00:16:34.230\nVonne, thank you so much for\nadding those tools for us.\n\n350\n00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.369\nAnd we do thank you good folks\nout there for watching but\n\n351\n00:16:36.369 --> 00:16:38.009\nI guess it's that time for us to sign off.\n\n352\n00:16:38.009 --> 00:16:40.790\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n353\n00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:41.423\n&gt;&gt;

All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n4\n00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:17.245\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:18.465\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\n\n6\n00:00:18.465 --> 00:00:23.355\nand in today's episode, we are back with\nmore of our PowerPoint 2016 for Mac.\n\n7\n00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:26.485\nAnd joining us in the studio again to\nlend her expertise on that topic for\n\n8\n00:00:26.485 --> 00:00:28.440\nus our good friend, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.200\nVonne, welcome back, how's it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.160\n&gt;&gt; I'm great,\nwe're going to talk all about images.\n\n11\n00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.830\n&gt;&gt; Images.\n&gt;&gt; Because if we're going to do PowerPoint\n\n12\n00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.060\npresentations about my cats,\nwe probably need some pictures of them.\n\n13\n00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.155\n&gt;&gt; Hopes to see them.\n\n14\n00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:42.105\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, yes, so Fuego and\nBishop need to be in our PowerPoint\n\n15\n00:00:42.105 --> 00:00:43.298\npresentation\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n16\n00:00:43.298 --> 00:00:46.070\nbecause a picture says a 1,000 words,\nright?\n\n17\n00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.090\nYou can always probably convey\na little bit more with an image maybe,\n\n18\n00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.990\nthan with text.\n\n19\n00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.920\nOr maybe you have some\ntext with some images.\n\n20\n00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.220\nBut images definitely are going to be a\nbig part of your PowerPoint presentation,\n\n21\n00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.540\nI'm sure, at one point.\n\n22\n00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.130\nSo we're going to just dive right in,\nand get some pictures going.\n\n23\n00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.340\n&gt;&gt; That's right, what would a PowerPoint\npresentation be if there wasn't some great\n\n24\n00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.730\nGetty images, [LAUGH] or something like\nthat thrown on top of them, right?\n\n25\n00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.750\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and I have a good collection\nof different cat pictures and\n\n26\n00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.300\nsome sunsets in there.\n\n27\n00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.040\n&gt;&gt; I'd be really interested in\nattending that presentation,\n\n28\n00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.520\nto be honest with you [LAUGH].\n\n29\n00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.294\nThat could get weird [LAUGH].\n\n30\n00:01:21.294 --> 00:01:24.209\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's true, so why don't we\nget into that weird presentation.\n\n31\n00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.870\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it.\n\n32\n00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.580\n&gt;&gt; And go right forward.\n\n33\n00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.833\nSo, I have a file up of named images.\n\n34\n00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:32.450\n[LAUGH] Appropriately named.\n\n35\n00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.587\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna make some fancy word\n\n36\n00:01:34.587 --> 00:01:39.020\nbut it wasn't working so\nI figured let's just go under images, so.\n\n37\n00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.123\nHow do we add a picture to\nthe PowerPoint presentation?\n\n38\n00:01:43.123 --> 00:01:46.687\nThere's two ways, you can either do it\nfrom the placeholder right here in this\n\n39\n00:01:46.687 --> 00:01:49.390\nparticular slide, or\nyou can do it through the insert tab.\n\n40\n00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.630\nSo I have both ways,\nI figure I'd go ahead and just show you.\n\n41\n00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.050\nJust don't waste anytime,\njust show me how to add a picture.\n\n42\n00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.270\nAnd then, we'll talk about all\nthe different nuances about\n\n43\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.080\nfiles resolution and\nfile types to just give you\n\n44\n00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.640\na little bit more\n&gt;&gt; Background information\n\n45\n00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.150\non working with images, and why some\npictures have a background and some don't?\n\n46\n00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.060\nAnd why is that?\n\n47\n00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.740\nAnd what's the white background?\n\n48\n00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.500\nSo, we'll talk about that.\n\n49\n00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.460\nBut first of all, this is a title and\n\n50\n00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.620\ncontent layout and\nthe pictures right here.\n\n51\n00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.907\nYou can see that if I wanted\nto click on add text.\n\n52\n00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:24.880\nBut they have these little buttons in the\nmiddle, that allow you to add other items.\n\n53\n00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.910\nSuch as Enter Table, or\nChart or Smart Art, or a video.\n\n54\n00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.890\nAnd they have,\nfunny cuz they have two buttons here.\n\n55\n00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.610\nThey have picture from file and\npicture from file.\n\n56\n00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.345\nWhy do they have two of them?\n\n57\n00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:40.254\nI'm not really sure,\nI have a theory about this, but\n\n58\n00:02:40.254 --> 00:02:42.140\nI don't know if I'm right or not.\n\n59\n00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.840\nBut when you have PowerPoint for\nMac there are two buttons still there.\n\n60\n00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.570\nThere's picture from file,\nthere's also picture from online, to\n\n61\n00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.490\nwhere you could actually access an online\ngallery through the Bing search engine.\n\n62\n00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.650\nIt'll go ahead and allow you to Add\nimages from online, from the websites.\n\n63\n00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.030\nBut in PowerPoint for\nMac it doesn't have that option,\n\n64\n00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.090\nit doesn't have\nInsert Picture from the Web.\n\n65\n00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.062\nSo, I'm assuming that they didn't\nwanna make it five buttons, so\n\n66\n00:03:11.062 --> 00:03:15.951\nthey just kept both of the image buttons,\nbut they both go to the picture from file.\n\n67\n00:03:15.951 --> 00:03:19.200\nSo, I think its maybe just a little\nbit less code that they would have\n\n68\n00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.989\nto write, so-\n&gt;&gt; You're giving them a lot of credit\n\n69\n00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:22.820\nover there.\n\n70\n00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.019\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Someone just messed up and\n\n71\n00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.215\nforgot it [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, that's my theory, I have no\n\n72\n00:03:28.215 --> 00:03:31.490\nevidence to back that up at all but-\n&gt;&gt; Pure speculation.\n\n73\n00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.090\n&gt;&gt; So, you could click either\nthe first picture from file or\n\n74\n00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.370\nthe second picture from file.\n\n75\n00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.356\nAnd it’s gonna give you the same thing.\n\n76\n00:03:36.356 --> 00:03:40.080\nThat actually goes out into\nyour files system on your Mac.\n\n77\n00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.520\nAnd so, it looks like where are you going\nbecause you might have files that somebody\n\n78\n00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.310\nhas given you from another organization.\n\n79\n00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.880\nOr somebody within your organization\nthat just gave you if they emailed you\n\n80\n00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.630\npictures, they had a folder that\nzipped up and they gave it to you.\n\n81\n00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.670\nAnd it's not part of\nyour photos on your Mac.\n\n82\n00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.350\nBut you might have pictures\nin your photos as well.\n\n83\n00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.670\nSo you can go either place, it doesn't\nreally matter where the picture lives.\n\n84\n00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.050\nOr how it got there, and\nthat sometimes is a whole another\n\n85\n00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.530\nball of wax of where do you\nwanna get your pictures from?\n\n86\n00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.960\nBut once I'm here, I can pick\nwhatever location I want to see.\n\n87\n00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.760\nWhether I do have a folder on\nmy desktop called Pictures or\n\n88\n00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.870\nI can go into my media and\nI have my photos that I also have photos\n\n89\n00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.830\ninstalled in my app that I use for my Mac.\n\n90\n00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.160\nSo here are all the pictures of,\nthere's our cats.\n\n91\n00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.330\nAnd there's some sunsets and everything.\n\n92\n00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.520\nSo I think we might add, [LAUGH]\nthis is one of my favorite pictures.\n\n93\n00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.620\nThis is Fuego in a tree.\n\n94\n00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.110\nHe likes to lay in this\ntree everyday pretty much.\n\n95\n00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.490\nAnd why that is, okay, I don't know why\nthat dialog box stayed up but it did.\n\n96\n00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.660\nSo I went ahead and cancelled that.\n\n97\n00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.480\nAnd so\nthis is the picture of Fuego in his tree.\n\n98\n00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.860\nHe's the jungle cat and\nwaves to all the neighbors.\n\n99\n00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.280\nSeriously, the neighbors then,\n\n100\n00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.310\nwhen they walk by, if they don't\nsee him in the tree in the morning,\n\n101\n00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.410\nthey're like, I see them kinda looking,\nI hear them call Fuego, Fuego.\n\n102\n00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.922\nCuz he's always out there at\nthe exact same time every morning.\n\n103\n00:05:06.922 --> 00:05:07.737\n&gt;&gt; He's got a routine.\n\n104\n00:05:07.737 --> 00:05:08.277\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n105\n00:05:08.277 --> 00:05:09.190\n&gt;&gt; You could set your\nclock by this guy [LAUGH].\n\n106\n00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.780\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n107\n00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.595\nAnd I think the neighbors have noticed,\nand they're like, hey, where did he go?\n\n108\n00:05:13.595 --> 00:05:15.976\nNow, any time that I'm gonna put\na picture in for the first time,\n\n109\n00:05:15.976 --> 00:05:19.300\nthere will be this thing that pops\nover on the right called design ideas.\n\n110\n00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.478\nDesign ideas is awesome, but\nwe're not going to go there just yet.\n\n111\n00:05:23.478 --> 00:05:27.960\nSo I wanna to just let you know\nthat it will be there but for now,\n\n112\n00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.810\nwe'll just gonna close it out and\nwe'll actually cover that in\n\n113\n00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.544\nthe design themes in, I believe, the next\nepisode, if you're watching this in order.\n\n114\n00:05:35.544 --> 00:05:36.139\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n115\n00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:38.460\nhere's picture from file and that's it.\n\n116\n00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.980\nJust find it and guess it right in.\n\n117\n00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.980\nPerfect.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n118\n00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.822\nit seems like it is a pretty\nstraightforward process,\n\n119\n00:05:44.822 --> 00:05:48.962\nnothing too complicated, and getting\nan image slapped into our slides there,\n\n120\n00:05:48.962 --> 00:05:51.465\nis that the end of our demonstration for\ntoday.\n\n121\n00:05:51.465 --> 00:05:54.690\nI mean,\nI'm assuming there's more to it than just.\n\n122\n00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.120\nHere's an image you've got up there,\nnow we're off to the races.\n\n123\n00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there is,\n\n124\n00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.430\nI just wanna show you quickly where\ndo I get a picture into PowerPoint?\n\n125\n00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.480\nAnd with that placeholder it goes\nahead and sizes the picture,\n\n126\n00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.600\nit keeps the aspect ratio and it did\nnot go all on top of my entire slide.\n\n127\n00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.616\nIt stayed within that area because\nthat's what we chose is from that\n\n128\n00:06:17.616 --> 00:06:22.547\nplaceholder within that well,\nplaceholder so it stays in there.\n\n129\n00:06:22.547 --> 00:06:25.820\nNow, I have this next slide here\nwhere it's just a blank slide.\n\n130\n00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.520\nWell, I think it's a,\nwe'll wait, it has a title.\n\n131\n00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.220\nSo it's a title slide only.\n\n132\n00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.440\nAnd if I wanted to insert a picture I can\nalways go over to the insert menu and\n\n133\n00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.630\nI can go to pictures.\n\n134\n00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.429\nAnd now, it says photo browser or\nit has picture from file.\n\n135\n00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.297\nYou kinda, well, you can get to the photo\nbrowser from picture from file, so,\n\n136\n00:06:43.297 --> 00:06:45.746\nit's kind of one half dozen of the other.\n\n137\n00:06:45.746 --> 00:06:48.909\nBut I did wanna show you\nthe option with a photo browser,\n\n138\n00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:51.813\nbecause it goes directly\nto your photos this time.\n\n139\n00:06:51.813 --> 00:06:56.390\nAnd the other thing you'll notice in this\nparticular one is that behind my head,\n\n140\n00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.010\nactually, there is no Insert button.\n\n141\n00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.230\nIn the other one, there was a,\nwhen we said get a picture from file,\n\n142\n00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.440\nI went to my photos and then I was able to\nclick Insert and then it went in there.\n\n143\n00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.600\nThe dialog box still stayed up but,\n[LAUGH] but at least in this one I wanted\n\n144\n00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.130\nto show you that how do you actually\nget a picture into your slide?\n\n145\n00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.640\nYou have to drag it.\n\n146\n00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.160\nSo I just drag it from\nthe photo library and\n\n147\n00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.560\nI can then just drop it\nright into my slide.\n\n148\n00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.450\nAnd since I don't have this\nin a content placeholder,\n\n149\n00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:29.550\nit is going to go ahead and size\nitself to the dimensions of the slide.\n\n150\n00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.730\nAnd so that's why it's going all the way\nto the top and the bottom of the slide.\n\n151\n00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.520\nAnd this is Bishop in\nhis little shark bed.\n\n152\n00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.237\nHe loves it.\n\n153\n00:07:38.237 --> 00:07:38.853\n&gt;&gt; How ironic.\n\n154\n00:07:38.853 --> 00:07:39.353\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n155\n00:07:39.353 --> 00:07:41.054\n&gt;&gt; Yes, he loves that thing, and\n\n156\n00:07:41.054 --> 00:07:43.400\nhe always ends up\n&gt;&gt; Convoluted?\n\n157\n00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.270\n&gt;&gt; Yes, taking half of themselves out of\nthe shark and it's always quite amusing.\n\n158\n00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.527\nSo here's our picture from file and\nyou can drag it into that.\n\n159\n00:07:52.527 --> 00:07:56.768\nIf I had gone to the picture from file\nthen I'm back out to where I was just\n\n160\n00:07:56.768 --> 00:08:00.458\nbefore where I could go ahead and\nlocate different pictures.\n\n161\n00:08:00.458 --> 00:08:02.781\nMaybe I had them on my desktop.\n\n162\n00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:04.289\nIn a specific folder.\n\n163\n00:08:04.289 --> 00:08:08.682\nAnd then if I pick maybe this one,\nnow I do have that insert button that's\n\n164\n00:08:08.682 --> 00:08:12.730\nbehind my head, because it does\ngo ahead and give me that option.\n\n165\n00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:17.455\nSo drag from the photo browser or\njust go ahead and pick it and insert.\n\n166\n00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:19.415\nYou could always select multiple images.\n\n167\n00:08:19.415 --> 00:08:23.435\nIf I wanted to select say\nmaybe this one and this one.\n\n168\n00:08:23.435 --> 00:08:25.635\nIf you hold your Cmd key\nyou could go ahead and\n\n169\n00:08:25.635 --> 00:08:28.215\nselect multiple images that\nare not next to each other.\n\n170\n00:08:28.215 --> 00:08:32.525\nIf I wanted to have maybe this picture,\nthis picture, and\n\n171\n00:08:32.525 --> 00:08:34.415\nthis picture within a series.\n\n172\n00:08:34.415 --> 00:08:39.760\n&gt;&gt; You can hold your Shift key Selecting\nthe first one holding your Shift key,\n\n173\n00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.030\nclicking on the last one and\n\n174\n00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.176\nactually I forgot that it has to be\nin a list view not in icon view.\n\n175\n00:08:45.176 --> 00:08:47.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you can just keep holding you Shift\n\n176\n00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.370\nkey down and select so either Shift or\nCommand we'll go ahead and\n\n177\n00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.170\nselect multiple images for you.\n\n178\n00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.460\nBut I do go in list mode,\n\n179\n00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.860\nthat's where if I hold my Shift key,\nthat's where it makes the range.\n\n180\n00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.100\nSo I always forget that\nwhen I'm working on my Mac.\n\n181\n00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.810\n&gt;&gt; Important safety tip.\n\n182\n00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:05.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n183\n00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.875\n&gt;&gt; Just remember, so anyways,\n\n184\n00:09:06.875 --> 00:09:09.378\nI'll just go ahead and\ngrab maybe two more, and\n\n185\n00:09:09.378 --> 00:09:12.006\nI'll click Insert.\nAnd then we can go ahead and\n\n186\n00:09:12.006 --> 00:09:15.246\nget our dynamic duo in there.\nI'm gonna keep on closing that designer\n\n187\n00:09:15.246 --> 00:09:18.236\npanel, you're like, please, show me that.\n&gt;&gt; I promise it will come there,\n\n188\n00:09:18.236 --> 00:09:20.506\nwe'll get there.\nAnd so now I can go ahead and\n\n189\n00:09:20.506 --> 00:09:23.406\ntake my pictures.\nMoving and re-sizing and\n\n190\n00:09:23.406 --> 00:09:28.040\nsome just basic modifications of our\nimages, you always gotta look for\n\n191\n00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.960\nmouse cursor icon,\njust like anything else.\n\n192\n00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.360\nThat four-pointered arrow when\nyou're over a selected image or not.\n\n193\n00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.770\nOr a not selected image Will indicate\nto you that I am over something,\n\n194\n00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:42.470\nthat if you click and drag, I will be\nmoving that item that you are over.\n\n195\n00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.060\nSo I can move them down.\n\n196\n00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.600\nWhat if I wanted to resize them cuz\nthey're kind of taking up too much space?\n\n197\n00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.670\nYou wanna go from a corner, and\nyou wanna how your Shift key.\n\n198\n00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.670\nWhy would you wanna do that?\n\n199\n00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.330\nBecause you wanna maintain proportions\nwhile you're sizing down your image.\n\n200\n00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.500\nCuz if I just took this, well, if I\ngrab a corner it's gonna do it anyway.\n\n201\n00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.650\nBut if I had grabbed here,\nI don't wanna squash them,\n\n202\n00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.010\nyou don't wanna skew the image.\n\n203\n00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.720\nSo, to me,\nthat's one of my biggest pet peeves.\n\n204\n00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.412\nI can find that from a mile away.\n\n205\n00:10:12.412 --> 00:10:15.064\n&gt;&gt; It's funny,\nthe human eye is actually very,\n\n206\n00:10:15.064 --> 00:10:19.270\nvery good at picking out things\nthat are inappropriate to nature.\n\n207\n00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.090\n&gt;&gt; No, okay.\n\n208\n00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:24.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like when they have snipers\nand they try to make those 3D camouflague?\n\n209\n00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.680\nThey say break up any\nnatural line like a boot or\n\n210\n00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.645\nwhatever as much as you can because.\n\n211\n00:10:29.645 --> 00:10:32.175\nBecause an eye is really\ngood about picking it out.\n\n212\n00:10:32.175 --> 00:10:32.755\nSo yeah.\n\n213\n00:10:32.755 --> 00:10:34.217\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; So that's why it bothers you so much,\n\n214\n00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:34.739\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n215\n00:10:34.739 --> 00:10:35.873\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it's suppose to.\n\n216\n00:10:35.873 --> 00:10:36.373\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes.\n\n217\n00:10:36.373 --> 00:10:37.685\nSome people can't see it though.\n\n218\n00:10:37.685 --> 00:10:38.847\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They look at it and they're like,\n\n219\n00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:39.447\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n220\n00:10:39.447 --> 00:10:40.976\nsome people are better than others.\n\n221\n00:10:40.976 --> 00:10:44.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think maybe it's being\nas much designing that I've done.\n\n222\n00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n223\n00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.310\n&gt;&gt; It's.\n&gt;&gt; You're super sensitive to it.\n\n224\n00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:47.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so.\n\n225\n00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.400\nIt's one of those,\nall of us have our thing.\n\n226\n00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:49.900\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n&gt;&gt; You know it.\n\n227\n00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:50.400\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n\n228\n00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.330\n&gt;&gt; As far as I don't see any of that.\n\n229\n00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:53.670\nAll right, so yeah, so grab the corner,\n\n230\n00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.730\nand I'm gonna go ahead and\nundo those changes.\n\n231\n00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.830\nBut I did tell you to hold your\nShift key while grabbing the corner.\n\n232\n00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.670\nWell I also forgot that\nPowerpoint doesn't automatically.\n\n233\n00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.930\nIf you go to a corner like see\nI'm not holding the Shift key,\n\n234\n00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.690\nit will maintain the proportions,\nso you don't have to.\n\n235\n00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:11.400\nI'm just so programmed to always\nholding your Shift key in\n\n236\n00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.370\nother products to\nmaintain the proportions.\n\n237\n00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:17.990\nThat's why I keep saying that, but it's\nnice that it does it for us automatically.\n\n238\n00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.068\nSo grab a corner, we can go ahead and\nresize our images.\n\n239\n00:11:21.068 --> 00:11:25.150\nTou also can Take the little\nrotate button on the top where\n\n240\n00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:29.470\nit get like you swirl in air and you would\ngo ahead and rotate that left and right.\n\n241\n00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:35.060\nAnd so some basic functionality of getting\na picture into a PowerPoint presentation.\n\n242\n00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:39.310\nAnd then, excuse me, and\nthen we sizing it and rotating it.\n\n243\n00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.400\nSo some basic stuff.\n\n244\n00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.080\nIs that it?\n\n245\n00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.730\nNo, there's a lot more to cover.\n\n246\n00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.735\nBut I did kinda want to\njump into image size.\n\n247\n00:11:47.735 --> 00:11:49.690\nNow this is a topic that\nI could talk a lot about.\n\n248\n00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.240\nBut I'm gonna keep it kinda basic for\nyou all in Power Point.\n\n249\n00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.310\nBecause we're not going to be\ndoing some major photo editing.\n\n250\n00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:00.290\nHowever there's a lot of neat things that\nyou can do with your images in PowerPoint.\n\n251\n00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:04.270\nWith the different styles and\nthe adjustments that you can that normally\n\n252\n00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:08.610\nyou would have to do in some type of\nimage editing program such as Photoshop.\n\n253\n00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:12.660\nSo there are some color\ncorrections that you can do but\n\n254\n00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:17.660\nthey don't really kind of get into sizing\nimages and all about the resolution.\n\n255\n00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.830\nBut I think it's a very important topic\nto cover, so let me jump into it.\n\n256\n00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.460\nImage size, what are we talking about?\n\n257\n00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:28.912\nWe're talking about the actual\npixel dimensions of a file.\n\n258\n00:12:28.912 --> 00:12:30.160\nLet me demonstrate.\n\n259\n00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:36.090\nSo we're going to insert\na picture from photo browser.\n\n260\n00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:40.580\nActually, before we do that,\nlet me take another route.\n\n261\n00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.990\nLet's go over here.\n\n262\n00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.970\nBefore we even put\nthe pictures into PowerPoint,\n\n263\n00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:48.350\nlet's look at them on our desktop,\nin our finder, to see the difference.\n\n264\n00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.970\nSo if I took these,\n\n265\n00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:56.020\nfrom this view, do any of these three\nfiles look different to you, Daniel?\n\n266\n00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:56.850\n&gt;&gt; Look different?\n\n267\n00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.300\nNo, they look identical.\n\n268\n00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.680\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n&gt;&gt; But they're not, okay?\n\n269\n00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.140\nAnd this is where people always say,\nwell, I put this picture, and\n\n270\n00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.930\nI made it bigger, and it's all blurry,\nit doesn't look good.\n\n271\n00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:13.470\nWell that's all about how much\ninformation is in your file to begin with\n\n272\n00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.720\nbefore you put it into your presentation,\nand\n\n273\n00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.510\nhow much, as I say,\nroom do you have to modify it?\n\n274\n00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:23.910\n&gt;&gt; So, if I go to my flower large,\nthis right here,\n\n275\n00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.310\nyour dimensions,\nyou have 3000 pixels by 4000 pixels.\n\n276\n00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:30.750\nThat means there's a lot,\na lot of information in here.\n\n277\n00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.510\nIt's an actual about a two\nmegabit file right here and so,\n\n278\n00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.910\nthis picture is very large.\n\n279\n00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.690\nYou sometimes hear people\nreferring to this as like,\n\n280\n00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.050\nthis is a high resolution image.\n\n281\n00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.730\n&gt;&gt; And if you're working with commercial\nprinting and everything you need to have\n\n282\n00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.420\nhigh resolution graphics because\nyou need to have a 300 PPI.\n\n283\n00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.790\nWhich is pixels per inch\nto be able to print\n\n284\n00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.330\nproperly in a commercial\nprinting environment.\n\n285\n00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.043\nAnd we're not going there.\n\n286\n00:13:53.043 --> 00:13:54.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because we're not doing commercial\n\n287\n00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.670\nprint and if you're like, I have no\nidea what you just said, that's okay.\n\n288\n00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.320\nWe don't really need to\nworry about the resolution.\n\n289\n00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.390\nWhat you need to look at\nare the pixel dimensions,\n\n290\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.970\nhow many pixels live in that photograph.\n\n291\n00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.800\nSo, this versus a flower medium,\n\n292\n00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.500\nas I called it appropriately,\nit's 300 pixels by 400 pixels.\n\n293\n00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.990\nAnd it's 48K, so\nthat's gonna be a much smaller image.\n\n294\n00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.840\nJust think the bigger the number,\nthe bigger the file.\n\n295\n00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.790\nSo, it's like if you're almost\nthinking like in inches in that sense\n\n296\n00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:29.190\nan eight by ten, versus by a five\nby seven, versus by a two by three.\n\n297\n00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.690\nThat's how you can kinda of equate to it.\n\n298\n00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:35.510\nAnd if you have a small file,\nand that's why a flower is small,\n\n299\n00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:36.710\n100 pixels by 133 pixels.\n\n300\n00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:41.280\nThat's a really small file\nit's not a lot of information.\n\n301\n00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:47.050\nSo by us going ahead and making all\nof these pictures bigger or smaller.\n\n302\n00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:50.530\nIf you have a small file to start with and\nyou wanna try to make it big, you\n\n303\n00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:56.660\nare going to get some degradation, some\nquality degradation and it's all blurry.\n\n304\n00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.150\nYou gotta know what you're starting with.\n\n305\n00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.300\nIf this is going in the bottom\nleft-hand corner or\n\n306\n00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.760\nbottom right-hand corner of your site,\nit just needs to be small.\n\n307\n00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.480\n&gt;&gt; Then you don't need a really big\npicture, you can use a small picture.\n\n308\n00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.670\nBut if it's gonna fill your whole slide,\nyou wanna make sure you have a high\n\n309\n00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:13.680\nresolution or\njust a larger file to start with.\n\n310\n00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.880\nAnd another little trick is\nthat I'm out here in my finder.\n\n311\n00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.620\nIf you select your pictures from\nyour finder and you have PowerPoint\n\n312\n00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:24.016\nopen in the background, you can just\ndrag and drop it off from your finder.\n\n313\n00:15:24.016 --> 00:15:24.639\nOoh, hello.\n\n314\n00:15:24.639 --> 00:15:26.300\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n315\n00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.560\n&gt;&gt; Did another little thing in between,\n\n316\n00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.310\nbut did you see that it went ahead\n&gt;&gt; Look how it looks under those\n\n317\n00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:32.200\ninfinity mirrors.\n\n318\n00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.360\n&gt;&gt; it went ahead and\nadded all three pictures or\n\n319\n00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.310\nany picture that I want right from\nmy finder, right into PowerPoint.\n\n320\n00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.600\nSo that's another little trick,\nif you want to know.\n\n321\n00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:44.335\nSo if I move this one over here, and\nI move the medium and the large,\n\n322\n00:15:44.335 --> 00:15:46.702\nif I took this large picture, and\n\n323\n00:15:46.702 --> 00:15:49.725\nI sized it down to make it really small,\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n324\n00:15:49.725 --> 00:15:54.319\nthen maybe tomorrow I come back and then\nI click this and I make it really big.\n\n325\n00:15:54.319 --> 00:15:57.538\nIt's not going to remove any\nof the pixel information.\n\n326\n00:15:57.538 --> 00:16:02.192\nThat's the nice thing About Photoshop,\nis it keeps all of the information of\n\n327\n00:16:02.192 --> 00:16:05.210\nthe photo, no matter how small or\nhow big you get.\n\n328\n00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:06.820\nNo matter how many times you resize it.\n\n329\n00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.825\nIf you did this in Photoshop\nwithout it being a smart layer.\n\n330\n00:16:09.825 --> 00:16:11.530\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; As soon as you made it smaller,\n\n331\n00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.360\nit removes all the pixels\nthat it doesn't need.\n\n332\n00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.570\nAnd then so you make it bigger, and\nthen it's going to go ahead and\n\n333\n00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:16.570\ndo the same thing.\n\n334\n00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.080\nI know I keep referring back to Photoshop,\n\n335\n00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.101\nbut that's because I spent\na lot of time on that product.\n\n336\n00:16:20.101 --> 00:16:21.277\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so I just try to.\n\n337\n00:16:21.277 --> 00:16:22.453\n&gt;&gt; Well it's a good comparison.\n\n338\n00:16:22.453 --> 00:16:24.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Between, because this is.\n\n339\n00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.810\nA product that does some things that\nare similar to what Photoshop does.\n\n340\n00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:31.490\nSo, if you're familiar with that\nenvironment, you're like, I get it.\n\n341\n00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:32.600\nGreat, this is all built in.\n\n342\n00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.870\nI understand where you're at.\n\n343\n00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.240\nAnd if not,\nif you ever jump into Photoshop, well,\n\n344\n00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.600\nnow you've got a nice\nplatform which to stand on.\n\n345\n00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.230\nAnd you can start working with Photoshop\na little bit easier than if you've never\n\n346\n00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:42.640\nseen this stuff before.\n\n347\n00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\nWhen we get into the artistic effects,\n\n348\n00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.310\nI mean, they're straight up\nlike the Photoshop filters.\n\n349\n00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n350\n00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.000\nso\n&gt;&gt; To me I was like, this is great!\n\n351\n00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.930\nI can't believe Microsoft has this now.\n\n352\n00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.130\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n353\n00:16:55.130 --> 00:17:00.060\nSo if I took this smaller picture and\nI tried to make this bigger,\n\n354\n00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.830\nnow you can really start seeing,\nyou see how it's fuzzier.\n\n355\n00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.372\nIt doesn't have the same quality,\n\n356\n00:17:06.372 --> 00:17:09.850\nbecause if it didn't have that\nmany pixels to start with.\n\n357\n00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:13.930\nAnd when you make it bigger it's trying\nto take whatever pixels it has and\n\n358\n00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.480\nit just doesn't work very-\n&gt;&gt; Stretch them.\n\n359\n00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it doesn't work very well.\n\n360\n00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:20.520\nSo if you need high quality\n\n361\n00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.510\npictures that need to be big\njust start with bigger pictures.\n\n362\n00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:28.080\nNow how you get those,\nwell that's where if you're\n\n363\n00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.540\ngiven something that's kinda\nsmall to begin with it's like.\n\n364\n00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.020\nYou can ask but they might be like,\nI don't know what you mean,\n\n365\n00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.480\nthis is the only picture I have.\n\n366\n00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:40.110\nSo sometimes, you don't really\nhave a choice with that but\n\n367\n00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.165\nmaybe try and find another picture or,\n\n368\n00:17:43.165 --> 00:17:49.107\nyou could always go into Photoshop\nupsample it but, whole different show.\n\n369\n00:17:49.107 --> 00:17:49.703\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n370\n00:17:49.703 --> 00:17:50.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But now, at least you have\n\n371\n00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:51.590\nan understanding of\n\n372\n00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:58.340\nfile size in relationship to what you can\ndo with it in the sense of resizing it.\n\n373\n00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:03.791\nAlong those same lines, file types,\nall right, gonna keep these short too.\n\n374\n00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:04.300\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n375\n00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.660\n&gt;&gt; JPEGs, do you know what\n\n376\n00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.890\nthat stands for?\n\n377\n00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:08.820\n&gt;&gt; Man, I used to know.\n\n378\n00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.430\nI don't remember.\n\n379\n00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:13.892\n&gt;&gt; Joint Photographic Experts Group\n&gt;&gt; Okay joint experts group that's right.\n\n380\n00:18:13.892 --> 00:18:15.310\n&gt;&gt; Because there is a E in there.\n\n381\n00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:15.820\nJPEG.\nYes.\n\n382\n00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.325\n&gt;&gt; Because they shortened it right.\n\n383\n00:18:17.325 --> 00:18:17.850\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n384\n00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.000\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; So if you see JPG or\n\n385\n00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:19.820\nJPEG, it's the same.\n\n386\n00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.165\nIt's the same type of file.\n\n387\n00:18:21.165 --> 00:18:22.910\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nYeah, it's the three extension or four,\n\n388\n00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:26.700\nthree letter or four letter extensions,\nand a lot of file formats will do that.\n\n389\n00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.920\nNow, this will probably be one of\nthe most commonly referred to or\n\n390\n00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.050\nknown file type in a sense, because.\n\n391\n00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:36.730\nA lot of times your photographs are going\nto be saved or stored as JPEGs.\n\n392\n00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:40.100\nThe JPEG file format does not\nsupport any transparency.\n\n393\n00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.560\nSo, if you have a picture that you've put\ninto PowerPoint, which we're going to do,\n\n394\n00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.470\nand you get that white background,\nas I call.\n\n395\n00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.440\nPeople like I can't get rid of\nthe white box probably because the file\n\n396\n00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.800\nformat that is is saved in it.\n\n397\n00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.373\nSome file format don't\nsupport transparency so\n\n398\n00:18:53.373 --> 00:18:56.960\nespecially when you\nare back in with clip art.\n\n399\n00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.740\nSome clip arts was transparent around\nthe edges and some had a white box.\n\n400\n00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:06.350\nThat's because if it was a JPEG it\ndoesn't have any transparency, you're\n\n401\n00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:10.500\ngonna get that it has to have pixels all\nthe way to the edge of the photograph.\n\n402\n00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:15.630\nBut a gif or a png, or P-N-G, those\nfile formats do support transparency.\n\n403\n00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:21.270\nSo it really just depends on what\nfile format the file was saved in.\n\n404\n00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.850\nNow you might not have any, well, you\nprobably don't have any control over that\n\n405\n00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.620\nif you don't know how to go in and\ndo some major editing.\n\n406\n00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:28.440\nAnd this why like, for\n\n407\n00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:33.570\nexample, Powerpoint can't really\ndo the things that Photoshop can.\n\n408\n00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:38.220\nI can take a JPEG save it as a PNG or\ntake a PNG and save it as a JPEG and\n\n409\n00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:43.430\nthat's what a lot of times, I as\na designer, have to do with Photoshop.\n\n410\n00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:46.540\nBut just having a basic understanding\n\n411\n00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:51.670\nof what a JPEG versus a GIF versus\na PNG is just gonna help you.\n\n412\n00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.642\nI think so because I love this stuff.\n\n413\n00:19:53.642 --> 00:19:57.420\nBut just knowing that, all right,\n\n414\n00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:03.240\nif I see a file extension with a GIF or a\nPNG, then I might have that transparency.\n\n415\n00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.980\nA lot of times they're your company logos,\n\n416\n00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.020\nyou have to save it in all\nsorts of different formats.\n\n417\n00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:09.655\nYou save it as a JPEG.\n\n418\n00:20:09.655 --> 00:20:15.035\nSave it as a PNG because it's gonna\nbe needed for different functions.\n\n419\n00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:18.100\nAnd you might want something with\ntransparency, you might not.\n\n420\n00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.795\nNow a GIF file format,\nit supports transparency.\n\n421\n00:20:22.795 --> 00:20:27.525\nNow it says well, PNG supports\ntransparency, too but this is where a GIF\n\n422\n00:20:27.525 --> 00:20:31.880\nhas a one-bit level transparency, and\na PNG has an eight-bit level transparency.\n\n423\n00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.650\nYou can actually have multiple\nlevels of transparency with a PNG,\n\n424\n00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:38.940\nlike with a drop shadow,\nwhich you can't have that with a GIF.\n\n425\n00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.290\nI'm starting to nerd out a little bit,\nbut.\n\n426\n00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:42.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But just so you know,\n\n427\n00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:46.520\nit basically acts like a JPG, and\nit gives kind of the best of both worlds.\n\n428\n00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:51.184\nBecause a GIF we also refer\nto GIFs in animated GIFs.\n\n429\n00:20:51.184 --> 00:20:53.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, where you see those.\n\n430\n00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.390\n&gt;&gt; There's actually some movement.\n\n431\n00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\na GIF file format can support animation.\n\n432\n00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.310\nBut in this sense,\nwe're not going to necessarily go there.\n\n433\n00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:05.303\nIt has small color support,\nso they look flatter?\n\n434\n00:21:05.303 --> 00:21:10.414\nYou want to use these file formats\nif you have large areas of color.\n\n435\n00:21:10.414 --> 00:21:13.942\nPhotograph saves as GIFs\nmight not look as clear or\n\n436\n00:21:13.942 --> 00:21:19.491\nas high quality if they're saved as\nGIF,because GIF support 256 colors.\n\n437\n00:21:19.491 --> 00:21:23.199\nA JPEG supports 56,536.\n\n438\n00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:24.333\n&gt;&gt; 65,000.\n\n439\n00:21:24.333 --> 00:21:26.174\n&gt;&gt; 65,000,I did that.\n\n440\n00:21:26.174 --> 00:21:28.100\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n&gt;&gt; I know, I transposed it again.\n\n441\n00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.310\n&gt;&gt; It's so easy to do.\n\n442\n00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:30.140\nDon't feel bad.\n\n443\n00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.950\nI have made that very mistake myself.\n\n444\n00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.660\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH] so that's where you have\nwith the different file format, so.\n\n445\n00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:39.840\nAgain, even if this is just a little\ntoo high on the geek level for\n\n446\n00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.230\nyou right here Okay.\n\n447\n00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.410\nJust say okay and it's fine.\n\n448\n00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.120\n&gt;&gt; Nod and smile and say move on.\n\n449\n00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.020\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nSmile and wave boys, smile and\n\n450\n00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.003\nwave [LAUGH].\n\n451\n00:21:50.003 --> 00:21:53.004\nBut once you get a picture like for\nexample here.\n\n452\n00:21:53.004 --> 00:21:54.938\nWhoops I went a little too fast.\n\n453\n00:21:54.938 --> 00:21:58.980\nYou have a slide that has\na colored background here and\n\n454\n00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.200\nyou go ahead and\ninsert a picture from file.\n\n455\n00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.940\nAnd I have some company logos\non my desktop right here.\n\n456\n00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:14.580\nYou can see that I have some of it already\nJPEG and some that are a PNG or a P-N-G.\n\n457\n00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:20.940\nAnd if I take my JPEG and I insert that,\nit's going to have that white background\n\n458\n00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:25.230\nbecause I can't support the transparency,\nso that's what I'm going to get.\n\n459\n00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:29.370\nVersus if I go ahead and\ninsert that PNG that I have.\n\n460\n00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:31.120\nOr whoops, I went to the wrong place.\n\n461\n00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.090\n&gt;&gt; That's the completely wrong spot.\n\n462\n00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:33.420\n&gt;&gt; I know, it was, whoops.\n\n463\n00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.760\nI just was one of the first one.\n\n464\n00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:42.140\nIf I go to this one you can see that this\nfile format does support transparency.\n\n465\n00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:46.750\nAnd so that would be the one that\nI would want to put into this.\n\n466\n00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.800\nNow, what if you don't have that option.\n\n467\n00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.290\nI'm like, well nobody sent me a PNG file,\nall I have is this JPEG.\n\n468\n00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.410\nThere is some pretty awesome,\n\n469\n00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:58.290\nneat things that you can do with\nthe moving a background in PowerPoint.\n\n470\n00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.809\nWhich we'll get to in two more slides.\n\n471\n00:23:00.809 --> 00:23:06.680\n[LAUGH] So I know about how to get our\npictures into our PowerPoint presentation.\n\n472\n00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.880\nWe know a little bit\nabout our file size and\n\n473\n00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.430\nour file types to just be aware\nof it when we go ahead and\n\n474\n00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:17.520\nget to our images, what can I do to\nstylize or pretty up this picture?\n\n475\n00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.550\nSo we have our dynamic duo right\nhere of our Flaggle and Bishop.\n\n476\n00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:26.050\nAnd I would like to go over to the picture\nformat, contextual tab on our ribbon.\n\n477\n00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:30.200\nSo if you have a picture and you select\nit, you will get the picture format tab.\n\n478\n00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.220\nThere's all sorts of fun\nthings we can do here.\n\n479\n00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.800\nWe can start with our quick styles.\n\n480\n00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.646\nQuick styles are just\na combination of outlines,\n\n481\n00:23:38.646 --> 00:23:43.440\nthe borders that you have, and all of\nthe different effects that you can do.\n\n482\n00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:47.430\nSo, you see I could have\none with a circular\n\n483\n00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:51.280\ncutout with a outline and\na drop shadow underneath it.\n\n484\n00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.440\nSo, that's a quick style.\n\n485\n00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.409\nI could go over to this one.\n\n486\n00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:56.494\nI think this is the one I usually like.\n\n487\n00:23:56.494 --> 00:23:58.821\nI like that one with the cut\ncorners on there and\n\n488\n00:23:58.821 --> 00:24:00.499\nit had a little bit of a soft glow.\n\n489\n00:24:00.499 --> 00:24:05.414\nThat all of these are just combined\ncollections of these different things,\n\n490\n00:24:05.414 --> 00:24:09.500\nthe outline and the effects, but\nyou can go in and change them.\n\n491\n00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.910\nSo you could start with a style,\n\n492\n00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:15.780\nand say well, maybe I wanna go ahead and\nmake this have a purple outline, or\n\n493\n00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:20.440\nmaybe a pink border color cuz I\nwas using Photoshop earlier and\n\n494\n00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.090\nthat's why there's some extra colors\ndown here in my recently used colors.\n\n495\n00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.320\nBut you can always go into\nthe more outline colors,\n\n496\n00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.590\njust like we did when we\nwere formatting our text.\n\n497\n00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:31.870\nYou can also go into how thick\nyou want the line to be.\n\n498\n00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:34.590\nAnd what style you want the line to be,\n\n499\n00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:37.210\nwhether you have dashed lines or\ndotted lines.\n\n500\n00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:39.430\nSo you could go crazy with\nformatting the outline,\n\n501\n00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:44.090\nand then you can really go crazy with\ngoing into all of the different effects.\n\n502\n00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.175\nSo you have things like drop shadows.\n\n503\n00:24:46.175 --> 00:24:49.915\nThe nice thing is they give\nyou little examples here and\n\n504\n00:24:49.915 --> 00:24:53.875\ndo you want an outer drop shadow,\nan inner drop shadow.\n\n505\n00:24:53.875 --> 00:24:56.295\nOnes that have it below,\nwhere you have the perspective,\n\n506\n00:24:56.295 --> 00:24:58.055\nit's almost like a shadow.\n\n507\n00:24:58.055 --> 00:25:00.275\nWell, I guess it is a shadow.\n\n508\n00:25:00.275 --> 00:25:01.525\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's not like a shadow.\n\n509\n00:25:01.525 --> 00:25:03.205\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say reflection.\n\n510\n00:25:03.205 --> 00:25:06.419\nBut if we go over to reflection\nyou can see that you have,\n\n511\n00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.570\nit's going to mirror the picture below.\n\n512\n00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:11.770\nSo, if I do a half reflection,\nthat's kinda,\n\n513\n00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:14.880\nI always think that's a really\nnice effect for some reason, so.\n\n514\n00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.490\nAnd you could go through each one\nof these glows, you can do a glow,\n\n515\n00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:22.150\nthe different levels of the glow,\nthe different colors of the glow.\n\n516\n00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:27.300\nYou can do your softer edges, so you have\nalmost that vignette look sometimes.\n\n517\n00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.390\nYou can also bevel your\nimages in different ways.\n\n518\n00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.350\nYou can go ahead and do some 3D rotation.\n\n519\n00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:36.250\nSo maybe I wanted to kind\nof rotate it this way.\n\n520\n00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:40.000\nBut which ever way you wanna do it you can\ngo through and start really making your\n\n521\n00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.800\npictures kind of give it a little more\npizzaz, a little more pop as they say.\n\n522\n00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:47.402\nAnd if I didn't like any of these,\nand that's the one thing,\n\n523\n00:25:47.402 --> 00:25:48.499\nwell I put all this stuff on.\n\n524\n00:25:48.499 --> 00:25:51.777\nHow could it just make it go away,\nlike can we just stop this now?\n\n525\n00:25:51.777 --> 00:25:53.020\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think I've taken this\n\n526\n00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:53.980\na little too far.\n\n527\n00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's time to back the trolley up.\n\n528\n00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:56.700\n&gt;&gt; There's a reset button.\n\n529\n00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.240\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n&gt;&gt; There is a reset button right here,\n\n530\n00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.400\nyou can see that if I drop this\ndown I can reset the picture\n\n531\n00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.610\n&gt;&gt; Now recent picture and\n\n532\n00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:06.410\nsize cuz this I did actually\nsized this photograph down so\n\n533\n00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:10.770\nyou could say, keep it how I sized it,\nbut all of formats go away.\n\n534\n00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:11.740\n&gt;&gt; All of the effects and stuff.\n\n535\n00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:12.260\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, either one.\n\n536\n00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.900\nI’m just gonna say reset the picture and\n\n537\n00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.380\nthen I could go back to my\nnormal regular picture.\n\n538\n00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.020\n&gt;&gt; Why would you say someone would be\nable to take a picture of themselves and\n\n539\n00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:23.585\nmaybe add the same\n&gt;&gt; Type of glow that Bruce Leroy had in\n\n540\n00:26:23.585 --> 00:26:24.651\nThe Last Dragon?\n\n541\n00:26:24.651 --> 00:26:26.240\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] So\n\n589\n00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:04.300\nyou can see I have all sorts of different\neffects that I could put on here.\n\n590\n00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:08.200\nI can have like scratched edges and\nit's really not showing up necessarily so\n\n591\n00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.660\nwell on this picture.\n\n592\n00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:13.870\nIt is it has a lot of [INAUDIBLE]\na lot of files, not a lot of files,\n\n593\n00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:17.100\na lot of pixels in these files It's\ntrying to affect every pixel so\n\n594\n00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.030\nyou might not see all of the effects.\n\n595\n00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.597\nBut if you really need you can go ahead\nand choose those different things.\n\n596\n00:28:22.597 --> 00:28:24.090\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nreset one more time.\n\n597\n00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:27.900\nAnd you also have the transparency\nthat's just the amount see-throughness.\n\n598\n00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:33.210\nIf you wanted to do that so lots of\ndifferent things that you can do with your\n\n599\n00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:37.980\nstyles and color corrections and all the\ndifferent things that PowerPoint can do.\n\n600\n00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.940\nAll of these features that I just\ntalked to you about, like the styles,\n\n601\n00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.620\nthe outline, the color.\n\n602\n00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.940\nWe have them in these drop\ndowns right here on the ribbon.\n\n603\n00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:50.430\nBut every time you see the more options,\noption in any of these,\n\n604\n00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.560\nthis is going to actually take you\nto the picture formating task.\n\n605\n00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:57.130\nPain and you could do it from there and\nyou could also right-click\n\n606\n00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:59.440\non your photograph and\nyou can go to format picture.\n\n607\n00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.690\nAnd then it's gonna bring up this task and\n\n608\n00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:06.380\neverything that we just did it just gives\nyou more features that you can control.\n\n609\n00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:10.210\nSo, if I wanted to go into the shadow you\ncan see that I could change the blur that\n\n610\n00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:11.910\nangle a distance of every single one.\n\n611\n00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:15.050\nInstead of just used\nthe presets you can customized.\n\n612\n00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:16.150\nEverything that you need.\n\n613\n00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:18.620\n&gt;&gt; This is definitely starting to look\na whole lot more Photoshop-like now,\n\n614\n00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:19.360\nat this point.\n\n615\n00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.225\nYeah, that's a lot of control.\n\n616\n00:29:21.225 --> 00:29:24.280\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah, like all of\nthe layer effects and everything?\n\n617\n00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.530\nIt's pretty much exactly the same thing.\n\n618\n00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:27.061\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n619\n00:29:27.061 --> 00:29:28.475\n&gt;&gt; So that's pretty neat.\n\n620\n00:29:28.475 --> 00:29:30.215\nLet's move on to slide eight.\n\n621\n00:29:30.215 --> 00:29:33.115\nWe have some more things that\nwe could do with our photograph.\n\n622\n00:29:33.115 --> 00:29:34.645\nWe have where I could crop.\n\n623\n00:29:34.645 --> 00:29:37.012\nNow, cropping in PowerPoint.\n\n624\n00:29:37.012 --> 00:29:39.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Photo point.\n\n625\n00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:41.325\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Photo point, yes,\n\n626\n00:29:41.325 --> 00:29:43.820\nin PowerPoint,\n&gt;&gt; It's not going that you remove\n\n627\n00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:47.180\nany of the areas is going\nto just hide the areas.\n\n628\n00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.780\nSo, that's nice it doesn't\ndelete the information.\n\n629\n00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.060\nAnd actually in the newer\nversion it doesn't do it either.\n\n630\n00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It didn't want it to.\n\n631\n00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.540\nBut if I wanted to take this I\nonly want the television part.\n\n632\n00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.870\nI don't want the ITProTV or\nour subtitles in there.\n\n633\n00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:00.980\nI just want this.\n\n634\n00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.910\nI can go up to my crop on\nthe picture format and\n\n635\n00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:06.350\nthen it shows you this\nlittle lines around it.\n\n636\n00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:10.860\nAnd they're almost like,\nI call them little pushers.\n\n637\n00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.702\nThey look like a little line with a-\n&gt;&gt; Pushers, hey kid.\n\n638\n00:30:13.702 --> 00:30:15.608\n[LAUGH] You need to get\nrid of those lines.\n\n639\n00:30:15.608 --> 00:30:19.060\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking more like a snow shovel,\nthat's what I was thinking.\n\n640\n00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.590\n&gt;&gt; I was like,\nVonne's got weird ideas about stuff.\n\n641\n00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:25.020\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna go ahead and\njust push this line up.\n\n642\n00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.220\nAnd so that's where I only wanna\nkeep that and if I click off or\n\n643\n00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.810\nI can hit the Enter key on the keyboard,\nor\n\n644\n00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:33.750\nI can just hit the escape it goes\nahead and says yep I'm done.\n\n645\n00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:36.230\nAnd I've gone ahead and\ncropped out that part.\n\n646\n00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:39.080\nMaybe I wanted to go ahead and\ncrop out some of this and\n\n647\n00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.260\nI could do the same but\n&gt;&gt; And this one,\n\n648\n00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.750\nI want to put them in a little heart.\n\n649\n00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:44.500\n&gt;&gt; Aww.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that'd be really cute, right?\n\n650\n00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.650\nSo you can crop to shape,\nwhich is kinda fun.\n\n651\n00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:47.210\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty cool.\n\n652\n00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:49.200\n&gt;&gt; So\nyou can pick whatever shape you want.\n\n653\n00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.020\nAnd I'm gonna say crop to a heart,\nand aww, there you go.\n\n654\n00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:55.350\nAnd I can do all my same styles, I can put\noutlines on it, and awesome fun stuff.\n\n655\n00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:57.750\n&gt;&gt; I see we can also resize the heart, so\n\n656\n00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:02.455\nit has the middle of the heart's kinda\ndipping down into the head of the cat.\n\n657\n00:31:02.455 --> 00:31:04.940\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Would you be able to fix that where you\n\n658\n00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.610\nmove it around the picture,\nso it's where you want it?\n\n659\n00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:09.430\n&gt;&gt; Kinda-\n&gt;&gt; Kinda?\n\n660\n00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:10.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n661\n00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:12.490\n&gt;&gt; I think you're thinking of the masks\n\n662\n00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:13.160\nand everything.\n\n663\n00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:17.090\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't work as much that way.\n\n664\n00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:20.345\nI think we could go ahead and\ntry and look at the position.\n\n665\n00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:23.532\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, as far as I know,\n\n666\n00:31:23.532 --> 00:31:24.260\nyou can't do that.\n\n667\n00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:25.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n668\n00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.250\n&gt;&gt; So, but-\n&gt;&gt; Well good to know, right?\n\n669\n00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:30.540\n&gt;&gt; Yep, but-\n&gt;&gt; Crop responsibly.\n\n670\n00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:31.156\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n671\n00:31:31.156 --> 00:31:31.668\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n672\n00:31:31.668 --> 00:31:32.368\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, I mean,\n\n673\n00:31:32.368 --> 00:31:35.470\nwe don't have as much functionality with\nthat one where I can move the picture\n\n674\n00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:38.210\nwithin the crop, but at least we can\ngo ahead and crop it into a heart.\n\n675\n00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:40.190\nAnd if we don't like it,\nwe can put it into a circle.\n\n676\n00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.840\n&gt;&gt; All right, there we go.\n\n677\n00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:45.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So again, I can go ahead and\ncrop to a specific shape.\n\n678\n00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.950\nAnd the other thing, if you wanted to,\nlet me go ahead and take that,\n\n679\n00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.677\nI'm gonna reset the picture.\n\n680\n00:31:50.677 --> 00:31:57.371\nYou can also crop it to specific\naspect ratios, like a 3x4 or 2x3.\n\n681\n00:31:57.371 --> 00:31:59.948\nSo this is more of a 16x9 aspect ratio,\n\n682\n00:31:59.948 --> 00:32:04.308\nI can do it to a three by four and\nit will just give me those proportions.\n\n683\n00:32:04.308 --> 00:32:07.970\nNow, I can go ahead and resize this,\nbut then they it kind of takes away.\n\n684\n00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:09.250\n&gt;&gt; You lose that effect.\n\n685\n00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:10.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n686\n00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:15.620\nBut you can also see that, in this sense,\nyou can move the picture inside of that.\n\n687\n00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:16.204\nYou know what?\n\n688\n00:32:16.204 --> 00:32:17.220\nThat actually makes you think.\n\n689\n00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm like, what if I took.\n\n690\n00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.340\nWell, come here.\n\n691\n00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.000\nLet's take the picture.\n\n692\n00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:23.780\nCome on.\n\n693\n00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.150\nI'll go back here, and\nwe'll reset the picture.\n\n694\n00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.385\nCome on, reset the picture, please.\n\n695\n00:32:34.062 --> 00:32:35.162\nMaybe not.\n[LAUGH]\n\n696\n00:32:35.162 --> 00:32:35.762\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't want to.\n\n697\n00:32:35.762 --> 00:32:36.262\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n698\n00:32:36.262 --> 00:32:38.440\nWe need to change the size.\n\n699\n00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.900\nIt's that one.\n\n700\n00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:40.560\n&gt;&gt; Aha.\n\n701\n00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.290\n&gt;&gt; Now we made it really, really big.\n\n702\n00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:45.460\nSo we'll go ahead and\njust make that much more small.\n\n703\n00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.610\nThis is a perfect example of right here.\n\n704\n00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:50.880\nIt's really, really big but can I just go\nahead and change the width and height?\n\n705\n00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.610\nI can actually type in the measurements\ninstead of changing the size down.\n\n706\n00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:54.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a whole lot easier.\n\n707\n00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.880\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\ntake this to five.\n\n708\n00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.240\nThat makes it a lot easier.\n\n709\n00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.800\nNow notice it does have keeping the aspect\nratios proportional to each other.\n\n710\n00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:06.710\nBecause you definitely do wanna have that,\nso I would not uncheck that.\n\n711\n00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.940\nSo if I take this, crop it to a picture.\n\n712\n00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.430\n&gt;&gt; Let's try to make\na Facebook cover photo.\n\n713\n00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:14.050\nLet's just try to make\na Facebook cover photo,\n\n714\n00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:16.216\nthen you, cuz you can't make that's weird.\n\n715\n00:33:16.216 --> 00:33:18.590\nThe other ones that's top\nof your Facebook page?\n\n716\n00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:20.479\nIt's like a long [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n717\n00:33:20.479 --> 00:33:21.323\n&gt;&gt; It's got a weird ratio.\n\n718\n00:33:21.323 --> 00:33:23.190\nAnd if you keep it [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Super long\n\n719\n00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.909\n&gt;&gt; You can't make that.\n\n720\n00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:24.409\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n721\n00:33:24.409 --> 00:33:25.905\nI do know what you're talking about.\n\n722\n00:33:25.905 --> 00:33:30.120\n[LAUGH] I don't think\nthis is going to work.\n\n723\n00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.830\n&gt;&gt; It's not, well, I was trying to\nget to where we could go ahead.\n\n724\n00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:35.100\nBut if we play around with that,\n\n725\n00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:39.150\nI wonder if we could get the aspect\nratio of the heart specific space.\n\n726\n00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:42.000\nAnd then, I could move the picture\naround to where I could\n\n727\n00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.040\nhave it to where they're\nnot cropping his head off.\n\n728\n00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo, I think we're on the right path.\n\n729\n00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:48.560\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we're definitely steaming\ndown the right trail here.\n\n730\n00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.115\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n731\n00:33:49.115 --> 00:33:49.890\n[LAUGH].\n\n732\n00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:51.870\nSo, we'll just say, yes, that sounds good.\n\n733\n00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:54.620\nAnd now it's,\nokay that's what I was looking for.\n\n734\n00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.630\nBut, at least you can\ntry to play around and\n\n735\n00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:59.700\nsee if the aspect ratio does\nkind of match to your shape.\n\n736\n00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.510\nAnd then you can move\nthe picture inside of it.\n\n737\n00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:04.329\nSo I think I have answered to your\nquestion [LAUGH] of whether it's\n\n738\n00:34:04.329 --> 00:34:05.120\npossible or not.\n\n739\n00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.423\n&gt;&gt; I'll defer to your expertise, my dear.\n\n740\n00:34:06.423 --> 00:34:10.506\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the last one that I want to show you\n\n741\n00:34:10.506 --> 00:34:14.470\nhere, well, actually,\nthere's a few other things.\n\n742\n00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:16.440\nI know that we're getting\ntowards our time, so\n\n743\n00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.550\nI don't know if we should continue on\nwith this or do you wanna keep going?\n\n744\n00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.920\nYeah Vonne, we can totally just\nroll this right into a part two.\n\n745\n00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.860\nNot a problem at all.\n\n746\n00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:27.150\nIt will actually give us a nice chance\nto digest what you've already shown us.\n\n747\n00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.422\nBefore we chew on another\npiece of this steak.\n\n748\n00:34:29.422 --> 00:34:31.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So looking forward to that.\n\n749\n00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:33.160\nThank you so much for\njoining us thus far though.\n\n750\n00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:34.800\nAnd getting us where we're at.\n\n751\n00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.070\nAnd we'll look forward to the culmination\nof what we can do with images\n\n752\n00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:40.460\nin part two of this here little\nseries we've got going on.\n\n753\n00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:41.830\nSo join us back for that.\n\n754\n00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:43.890\nBut as for this episode,\nwe're gonna call it a day.\n\n755\n00:34:43.890 --> 00:34:46.270\nFor ITPro.TV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n756\n00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:47.019\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n757\n00:34:47.019 --> 00:34:47.732\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n758\n00:34:47.732 --> 00:34:54.712\n[MUSIC]\n\n759\n00:34:54.712 --> 00:35:02.240\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV\n\n",

00:00:08.429\n[CROSSTALK]\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.182\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.182 --> 00:00:13.927\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:13.927 --> 00:00:16.960\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.190\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we're actually continuing\n\n8\n00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.010\non with our PowerPoint 2016 for\nMac series.\n\n9\n00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.750\nAnd joining us back again for\na part two on images, manipulating images,\n\n10\n00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.315\nworking with images.\n\n11\n00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:30.523\nThe great things you can do with them.\n\n12\n00:00:30.523 --> 00:00:31.751\n[LAUGH] Here's our good friend, Ms.\n\n13\n00:00:31.751 --> 00:00:33.742\nVonne Smith, Vonne welcome back,\nhow's it going today?\n\n14\n00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.220\n&gt;&gt; Good, good.\n\n15\n00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.850\nI'm glad to be back to\n\n16\n00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.945\nshow you some more things-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n17\n00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:40.634\n&gt;&gt; Because I have so much to talk\nabout when we talk about images.\n\n18\n00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:42.343\n&gt;&gt; A cornucopia [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A cornucopia [LAUGH] yes.\n\n19\n00:00:42.343 --> 00:00:47.215\nSo we're gonna get right back into\nit because right where I left off\n\n20\n00:00:47.215 --> 00:00:48.180\nin part one.\n\n21\n00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.860\nSo if you want to go back and\nwatch part one, definitely do that.\n\n22\n00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.230\nAnd we left off by going to the crop.\n\n23\n00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.100\nWe were cropping Fuego and\nBishop into a little heart.\n\n24\n00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.200\nBecause I thought they were so cute,\nbecause they're my little loves.\n\n25\n00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.430\nAnd you had actually asked about\nmoving the picture around in there.\n\n26\n00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.160\nSo, in between our little breaks,\nI was like, I need to find this,\n\n27\n00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.330\nI wanna see if this can be done,\nand it actually can.\n\n28\n00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.581\nSo, I wanted to just show you\nthe question that you asked and\n\n29\n00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:14.085\nhow I can answer it for you.\n\n30\n00:01:14.085 --> 00:01:16.690\n&gt;&gt; Teach us, swami [LAUGH].\n\n31\n00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.640\n&gt;&gt; So, we have our picture and we had\ntalked about cropping it to shape and\n\n32\n00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.890\nwe went ahead and made it into a heart.\n\n33\n00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.380\nYou'd asked if you can move\nthe picture from within the shape.\n\n34\n00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.260\nYou can.\n\n35\n00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.700\nJust had to go down a little bit further\nand to the fit and the fill options.\n\n36\n00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.740\nAnd if I go to fill,\nyou could see that it actually gives me\n\n37\n00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.520\nthe options to start\nmoving the photograph.\n\n38\n00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.370\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I was asking about.\n\n39\n00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.638\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, it can be done, I just\nhad to find the button to make it happen.\n\n40\n00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:49.608\n[LAUGH] Now, the thing is, if I move\nthis over a little bit or a little down,\n\n41\n00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:53.340\nyou can see that the picture is\nactually not big enough for the shape.\n\n42\n00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.250\nSo if you wanted to,\nnotice cuz this is the picture.\n\n43\n00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.100\nI could take this and if I grab a corner,\n\n44\n00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.670\nI can make the picture\na little bit bigger.\n\n45\n00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.060\nThis is definitely where you would\nwanna hold your Shift key down because,\n\n46\n00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.530\nits not maintaining the aspect ratio.\n\n47\n00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.531\nSo if I make it a little bit\nbigger that way I have a little\n\n48\n00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:12.282\nbit more of the photograph\nto kind of move around.\n\n49\n00:02:12.282 --> 00:02:16.860\nAnd if I made it smaller I can do that,\nlet me hold that Shift key.\n\n50\n00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.370\nBut you just wanna make sure that you\ndon't get past the shape itself so,\n\n51\n00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.710\nit does matter like how much of\nthe photograph you have to move around in\n\n52\n00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.910\nthere, but you can do it.\n\n53\n00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.316\n&gt;&gt; Some definite manipulation\nas I would like.\n\n54\n00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n55\n00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.920\ncuz we talked about doing\nthe aspect ratio, and\n\n56\n00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.370\nI had to go one more\nthing down to find it.\n\n57\n00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.280\n&gt;&gt; Almost there.\n\n58\n00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.969\n&gt;&gt; Almost there, but now we are there.\n\n59\n00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:40.985\n&gt;&gt; So there you go.\n\n60\n00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:43.430\n[LAUGH] So we know how to crop and\n\n61\n00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.310\nmove the photograph within the shape\nthat we wanted to go with.\n\n62\n00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.270\nBut we wanna talk about\nremoving the background.\n\n63\n00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.095\nI think this is a pretty awesome\ntechnique that you can do.\n\n64\n00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:55.700\nAnd like, so example right here.\n\n65\n00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.971\nWe have our ITPRO.TV logo that is on a\nlike an orange background but we have that\n\n66\n00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:04.940\nwhite because of that JPEG file,\nbecause JPEGs don't support transparency.\n\n67\n00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.760\nSo I want to get rid of\nthe white around the photograph.\n\n68\n00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.480\nBut first, I am gonna go ahead and\n\n69\n00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.350\ncrop this down first, because I don't\nreally want to have any of the text.\n\n70\n00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.423\nI just want the television.\n\n71\n00:03:16.423 --> 00:03:21.980\nBut now, and I can click off or say okay,\nor hit the Escape key and I got that.\n\n72\n00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.000\nNow I wanna remove all the white\naround the television.\n\n73\n00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.450\nSo there is an option on the Picture\nFormat tab called remove the background.\n\n74\n00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.900\nNow when you click on remove\nthe background everything goes pink.\n\n75\n00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.656\nEverything that is pink are the areas\nthat you're wanting to remove.\n\n76\n00:03:37.656 --> 00:03:39.500\nLike, I don't want that anymore.\n\n77\n00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.550\nBut you do have to watch\nabout this box right here.\n\n78\n00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.880\nBecause if I had just said,\nokay, everything's fine,\n\n79\n00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.680\nit would actually cut off\nthe bottom of the photograph.\n\n80\n00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.240\nSo, you do wanna make\nsure that this box is\n\n81\n00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.030\nkind of going around all\nthe area that you wanna keep.\n\n82\n00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.890\nAnd you want to start manipulating first.\n\n83\n00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.080\nSo, I'm just gonna kind of move\nthat where I want it to go.\n\n84\n00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.680\nAnd I actually clicked somewhere I just\nundid really quick, because I don't want\n\n85\n00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.570\nit to do that, but the thing with our\nlogo is that I want the I and the T.\n\n86\n00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.060\nThat does need to be white.\n\n87\n00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.110\nI wanna keep that.\n\n88\n00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.040\nSo sometimes when you say,\nremove the background.\n\n89\n00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.670\nAnd it doesn't necessarily\neven have to be white.\n\n90\n00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.763\nIt could be any solid color, really.\n\n91\n00:04:14.763 --> 00:04:18.220\nI wanna take that away but keep this part.\n\n92\n00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.088\nI'm gonna zoom in a little bit so\nyou can see this and\n\n93\n00:04:21.088 --> 00:04:23.501\nyou can see well thank you I know that.\n\n94\n00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:28.913\n[LAUGH] I have this line like a plus\nsign at the bottom of my mouse and\n\n95\n00:04:28.913 --> 00:04:35.660\nwhat this means is if I started drawing\nlines in the area that I want to keep.\n\n96\n00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.000\nI'm designating that yes, keep it here and\nsometimes you might have to kinda go on\n\n97\n00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.540\na couple places it's almost like I'm\nout lining it, it's like coloring.\n\n98\n00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.770\nAt least when I was doing coloring,\ncolor around the edges first and\n\n99\n00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.200\ncolor all on the inside first.\n\n100\n00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.100\nSo I'm just saying yes, all of this area.\n\n101\n00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.210\n&gt;&gt; It seems like it's smart\ndetecting the edges of that as well.\n\n102\n00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but if I just kind of went like\nthat, it's like I see an edge here but\n\n103\n00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.370\nI don't know how far down you want it.\n\n104\n00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.720\nSo you might have to depending\non the area, do a couple lines.\n\n105\n00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.750\nAnd if I dragged all the way down here,\n\n106\n00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.380\nlet me go ahead, across,\nthat should start kind of picking up.\n\n107\n00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.210\nAll right, there, perfect.\n\n108\n00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.940\nSo, I'm just kind of dragging my mouse\nin the areas that I want to keep,\n\n109\n00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.570\nI don't want to remove.\n\n110\n00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.220\nEverything else that is pink,\nI do want you to remove.\n\n111\n00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.610\nAnd then, so if I go ahead and\nhit enter, enter just goes ahead and\n\n112\n00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.070\nlet's me say yep, I'm done, and\nnow I've removed the background, and\n\n113\n00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.239\nI think that's pretty awesome.\n\n114\n00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:28.771\n&gt;&gt; That is pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n115\n00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:32.310\nyou can still do all of your styles,\nif I did like a drop style.\n\n116\n00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.290\nActually, not the styles necessarily,\nbut the shadows here,\n\n117\n00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.980\nthe actual individual effects.\n\n118\n00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.810\nSee, now the shadows\ngoing on the television,\n\n119\n00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.590\nnot the box, the actual photograph.\n\n120\n00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.290\nIt's just within the pixel\ninformation that it sees here.\n\n121\n00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.603\nSo I think that's pretty,\npretty handy, so I like that one.\n\n122\n00:05:48.603 --> 00:05:51.627\n&gt;&gt; So whether or\nnot you get a PNG or a JPEG,\n\n123\n00:05:51.627 --> 00:05:55.800\nyou can make it to do\nthe exact same type of things?\n\n124\n00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.660\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you do have to have a pretty\nsimple, I would say, background to remove.\n\n125\n00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.606\nIf it's a really-\n&gt;&gt; Nothing crazy,\n\n126\n00:06:01.606 --> 00:06:02.439\nlike a bed of flowers or something?\n\n127\n00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:04.440\nYeah, that could be-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n128\n00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.860\nI mean,\nthere are some limitations to this.\n\n129\n00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.243\nIt's really handy for things like that.\n\n130\n00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:11.582\nThere was a large area of white around it.\n\n131\n00:06:11.582 --> 00:06:15.576\nIf there was like all sorts of textures\nwith it, and some other things here and\n\n132\n00:06:15.576 --> 00:06:17.918\nthere, it might not be\nable to see it as well.\n\n133\n00:06:17.918 --> 00:06:22.385\nSo, it does depend on the photograph\nyou have to begin with,\n\n134\n00:06:22.385 --> 00:06:26.940\nof how easy or how hard it will\nbe to remove your background.\n\n135\n00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.840\nBut it is nice, especially when\nyou start getting into design\n\n136\n00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.020\nthemes where you have different\ncolors going on in the background,\n\n137\n00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.163\nand you want to have\nthe background removed.\n\n138\n00:06:35.163 --> 00:06:37.966\nAt least it's all in here, and\nyou don't have to go out to Photoshop and\n\n139\n00:06:37.966 --> 00:06:40.230\nsome other fancy program\nto be able to do it.\n\n140\n00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.733\nPhotoshop PowerPoint will\nwill let you do that.\n\n141\n00:06:42.733 --> 00:06:44.019\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can't stop today, can I?\n\n142\n00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:45.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're on a tear [INAUDIBLE].\n\n143\n00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.783\n&gt;&gt; Well, we started talking about images,\nand it's just,\n\n144\n00:06:47.783 --> 00:06:49.561\nmy mind automatically\n[CROSSTALK] the product.\n\n145\n00:06:49.561 --> 00:06:53.147\n&gt;&gt; Well, the defacto program for\nphoto manipulation is Photoshop.\n\n146\n00:06:53.147 --> 00:06:56.682\nAnd when you use that a lot,\nas we both have done,\n\n147\n00:06:56.682 --> 00:06:59.370\nso you just wanna start saying that.\n\n148\n00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.251\n&gt;&gt; I think it's going on 15 years.\n\n149\n00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:05.342\n&gt;&gt; Well, the fact that you're doing\nthings that normally you would be\n\n150\n00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.925\ndoing in Photoshop inside of PowerPoint,\n\n151\n00:07:07.925 --> 00:07:11.890\ntells you how far PowerPoint has\ncome as a manipulation program.\n\n152\n00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.000\nThat you don't need to now go\nget a Creative Cloud account,\n\n153\n00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.510\nto make really great PowerPoint slides.\n\n154\n00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.950\nYou can do a lot from inside\nof PowerPoint itself.\n\n155\n00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:20.550\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n156\n00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think they've really come\n\n157\n00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.800\na long way with what you can do\nin manipulating photographs,\n\n158\n00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.060\nso yes, very, very well said.\n\n159\n00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.050\nSo, now I want to go ahead and\n\n160\n00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.650\nmove on to slide 8 because\nthat's where we left off and\n\n161\n00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.230\nI was going down our list of the different\nthings on the Picture Format tab.\n\n162\n00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.726\nAnd so, we have talked about reset picture\nquite a few times, but change picture\n\n163\n00:07:41.726 --> 00:07:46.106\nlike for example here, in a photograph\nthat I already have certain styles on.\n\n164\n00:07:46.106 --> 00:07:52.280\nI have outlines, I have drop shadows,\nhere I have it cropped to a specific area.\n\n165\n00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.480\nAll of those different stylistic effects\nthat I have done, but now I just\n\n166\n00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:00.430\nwant a different photograph, but I don't\nwant to have to redo all of those styles.\n\n167\n00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:05.286\nYou can come into the photograph and over\non the picture tab there is an option for\n\n168\n00:08:05.286 --> 00:08:09.216\nchange picture, and then I can\ngo out into my different photos.\n\n169\n00:08:09.216 --> 00:08:12.567\nAnd so maybe I wanna take this\npicture of my little babies and\n\n170\n00:08:12.567 --> 00:08:15.510\nthen it goes ahead and\nputs the picture in here.\n\n171\n00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.710\nNow, it did change the aspect\nratio here because it was this\n\n172\n00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:23.062\npicture is more of a portrait versus a\nlandscape photograph, so you might want to\n\n173\n00:08:23.062 --> 00:08:27.106\nconsider trying to keep the same\noriginal aspect ratio of the photograph.\n\n174\n00:08:27.106 --> 00:08:30.010\nIt would probably work\na little bit better than here.\n\n175\n00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:34.810\nBut at least you can see that if\nI have all those effects applied,\n\n176\n00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:36.110\nI can just change the photograph.\n\n177\n00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.150\nSo you could always go ahead and\ndo something like that.\n\n178\n00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.125\nI'm gonna undo that because\nI like that picture better,\n\n179\n00:08:41.125 --> 00:08:42.296\nthat's my favorite photograph.\n\n180\n00:08:42.296 --> 00:08:43.428\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\n\n181\n00:08:43.428 --> 00:08:47.840\nand in the next option, or\nthe next item on this is compress images.\n\n182\n00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.850\nAnd to me, it's\n\n183\n00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:58.390\nmore like a theoretical topic to\ntalk about but compressing pictures.\n\n184\n00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.094\nIn our first series, or the first part,\nwe talked about image size.\n\n185\n00:09:01.094 --> 00:09:05.303\nAnd you want really large photographs to\nbe able to resize them, and then make them\n\n186\n00:09:05.303 --> 00:09:09.970\nbigger, and do all the different things,\nand you want high quality images.\n\n187\n00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.800\nThat's great but it could come at a price.\n\n188\n00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.360\nIf you have a slide show that\nhas a hundred slides in it, and\n\n189\n00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.902\nyou have 150 photographs that were all\n3,000 by 4,000 pixels to begin with.\n\n190\n00:09:22.902 --> 00:09:26.600\nAnd they're all in there, and\nthey're all like maybe half the size or\n\n191\n00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.232\nan eighth of the size as\nthey originally started,\n\n192\n00:09:29.232 --> 00:09:33.430\nyou're gonna start getting into a really\nlarge file of your Photoshop file.\n\n193\n00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:37.678\nSo, It can be a good, and\nsometimes, a bad thing.\n\n194\n00:09:37.678 --> 00:09:40.740\nEspecially if you're trying to\nsend this PowerPoint presentation\n\n195\n00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.850\nto another person and\nyou're sending it through email,\n\n196\n00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.850\nyou do have some size limitations on your\nemail that might not let you do that.\n\n197\n00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.750\nI know that we had a, in one of my\nformer jobs, we had a professional\n\n198\n00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:56.598\ndesign company design these really\nbeautiful PowerPoint presentations, and\n\n199\n00:09:56.598 --> 00:09:58.610\nthey used these really big pictures.\n\n200\n00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:02.493\nAnd the PowerPoint,\nit was only like six slides,\n\n201\n00:10:02.493 --> 00:10:07.127\nbut the PowerPoint was like 5 gigs or\nsomething like that.\n\n202\n00:10:07.127 --> 00:10:11.987\nIt was a really big file, and it took\na long time for it to like transfer,\n\n203\n00:10:11.987 --> 00:10:16.610\nand load up, and great images, but\nthey only took up so much space.\n\n204\n00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.263\nSo I really don't need them\noccupying the file space\n\n205\n00:10:20.263 --> 00:10:24.680\nmore than the space that\nthey occupy on the slide.\n\n206\n00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.090\nLong story short, you can do compressing.\n\n207\n00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:31.210\nYou can compress your images on your\npresentations, and I have that option.\n\n208\n00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:34.130\nIt's a really quick button and\nit's very simple.\n\n209\n00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:38.420\nBut that whole idea behind it is\nthat's where I wanted to kind of\n\n210\n00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.636\ngive you a longer explanation about this.\n\n211\n00:10:40.636 --> 00:10:45.030\nWe'll start with well,\nwe'll start with the ITPRO.TV logo.\n\n212\n00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.260\nRemember, we had cropped out part of it.\n\n213\n00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.340\nWe had removed the background, so we took\nout a lot of information off that file.\n\n214\n00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.440\nThe picture here, this was a really\nlarge photograph to begin with, but\n\n215\n00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.360\nI don't need all of that information.\n\n216\n00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.750\nSo let's stay with this picture here.\n\n217\n00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.160\nIf I go over to the picture format tab and\n\n218\n00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.900\nI come over to this button\nwhich is the compress pictures.\n\n219\n00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.916\nIt gives me the options here of, do you\nwant me to compress just this picture,\n\n220\n00:11:10.916 --> 00:11:14.479\nI love this feature,\nall of the pictures in this file.\n\n221\n00:11:14.479 --> 00:11:18.260\nSo that 100 slide PowerPoint\npresentation with 150 pictures.\n\n222\n00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.900\nYou can say just do it all of them and\nit will significantly\n\n223\n00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:27.510\nreduce the size of your files if you have\nthat much information to start with.\n\n224\n00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.400\nAnd so now,\nwhat quality do I wanna do this?\n\n225\n00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.210\nNow, I'm not going to be doing\nnecessarily the commercial printing so,\n\n226\n00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.850\ndo I need all of that extra information?\n\n227\n00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.558\nNo cuz,\nyou're going to be doing this on screen.\n\n228\n00:11:38.558 --> 00:11:42.760\nSo you really probably wouldn't need\nto go any higher than 150 or 96,\n\n229\n00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.440\neven if you don't know PPI.\n\n230\n00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.320\nBigger and smaller, smaller, less.\n\n231\n00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.760\nSo, you just go with the number.\n\n232\n00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.080\nSo, you could email it 96 or\nI would probably just stay at 150.\n\n233\n00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.167\nJust a little bit more.\n\n234\n00:11:56.167 --> 00:11:59.401\nAnd notice that you can delight, delight?\n\n235\n00:11:59.401 --> 00:12:01.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Delight in your cropped pictures.\n\n236\n00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.330\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\ndelete the cropped areas of your pictures.\n\n237\n00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.040\nSo, all of that extra stuff that I got rid\nof, that will significantly reduce your\n\n238\n00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:13.280\nsizes as well, and I want it to have all\nthe pictures in the file, and I click OK.\n\n239\n00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.573\nAnd then it will go ahead and\nreduce all of your file sizes down.\n\n240\n00:12:18.091 --> 00:12:21.423\nWith a presentation that only has nine\nslides, you might not see a huge change,\n\n241\n00:12:21.423 --> 00:12:24.825\nbut like I was saying in my example, of\nif we have, I think there's six or seven.\n\n242\n00:12:24.825 --> 00:12:25.940\n&gt;&gt; 100 slides, or whatever.\n\n243\n00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or we had ten slides in a\npresentation, but the pictures were huge.\n\n244\n00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:34.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do photography, and some of\nthe pictures that I take are 22, 25,\n\n245\n00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.982\nmaybe even 30 megs.\n\n246\n00:12:35.982 --> 00:12:39.750\nAll right, that's a lot for\njust one picture.\n\n247\n00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.750\nIf I had 100 slides, and\nthey all had one on there,\n\n248\n00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.930\nthat's now inflating the size\nof that PowerPoint presentation.\n\n249\n00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.811\nAnd that CPU has to crank through that,\nit's gotta churn through that information,\n\n250\n00:12:47.811 --> 00:12:50.584\nit's gotta render it on a screen, it's\ngotta do anything else that it's doing.\n\n251\n00:12:50.584 --> 00:12:54.432\nRun PowerPoint, a lot of stuff,\nso compressing that down and\n\n252\n00:12:54.432 --> 00:12:58.946\njust giving you still a high quality\nimage inside of this presentation,\n\n253\n00:12:58.946 --> 00:13:02.080\ncuz you think we're not\nhere to judge how great.\n\n254\n00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.399\nI'm not gonna blow up my pictures, to\nthe nth degree and do some pixel peeping,\n\n255\n00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:09.170\nI'm going to just need to be\nable to see the image and\n\n256\n00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:13.319\nmake it look at least somewhat like\nquality, but not down to the nth degree.\n\n257\n00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:14.329\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't need it.\n\n258\n00:13:14.329 --> 00:13:15.572\n&gt;&gt; No, it's overkill.\n\n259\n00:13:15.572 --> 00:13:17.937\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so why don't we\njust let PowerPoint go ahead and\n\n260\n00:13:17.937 --> 00:13:18.800\ncompress everything?\n\n261\n00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.380\nIt's great, so.\n\n262\n00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:26.100\nAnd the other thing I wanted to point out\non slide nine is something that you might,\n\n263\n00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.120\nif you're a Word user and\nyou've come over here in Word.\n\n264\n00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.710\nYou have something known as textwrap\nwhere if you put a picture in,\n\n265\n00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.720\nI always call it the little doggy button.\n\n266\n00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.280\nIt looks like a little dog and\n\n267\n00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.076\nyou would actually have how the text\nwould wrap around the picture.\n\n268\n00:13:40.076 --> 00:13:42.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; I just always, one of those things.\n\n269\n00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:43.735\nIt's the dog button.\n\n270\n00:13:43.735 --> 00:13:46.164\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, marches to the beat of\nher own drum, ladies and gents.\n\n271\n00:13:46.164 --> 00:13:47.806\n&gt;&gt; I call it like it is.\n\n272\n00:13:47.806 --> 00:13:49.118\nIt looks like a dog so.\n\n273\n00:13:49.118 --> 00:13:54.615\n&gt;&gt; She likes to sit around, look at clouds\nand go that one looks like a fluffy lion.\n\n274\n00:13:54.615 --> 00:13:55.805\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, I also name my shoes.\n\n275\n00:13:55.805 --> 00:13:58.022\nSo I mean, all my shoes have names.\n\n276\n00:13:58.022 --> 00:13:59.000\n&gt;&gt; You see what I'm working with, people?\n\n277\n00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.740\nSomeone call help, okay?\n\n278\n00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.647\nI need help.\n\n279\n00:14:01.647 --> 00:14:03.918\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I'll take this.\n\n280\n00:14:03.918 --> 00:14:07.680\nWe'll just take our\nlittle babies right here.\n\n281\n00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.540\nI'm gonna go ahead and copy this and\n\n282\n00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.175\nI'm going to do Cmd+C and\nI'm gonna come over slide nine.\n\n283\n00:14:12.175 --> 00:14:13.389\nI'm gonna do Cmd+V and\n\n284\n00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:17.343\nI'll make this a little smaller an I\nwill get to you design ideas, I promise.\n\n285\n00:14:17.343 --> 00:14:22.267\nBut now I get here there is no\na dog button, there is no textwrap\n\n286\n00:14:22.267 --> 00:14:28.610\nbutton to say take this image and\nwrap the text around this picture.\n\n287\n00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:32.656\nSo if you were for example, you really\nwanna go ahead and put this picture here\n\n288\n00:14:32.656 --> 00:14:36.658\nand move the paragraph over you have to\nget a little creative in how you do it.\n\n289\n00:14:36.658 --> 00:14:40.451\nNow everything here is in it's own object.\n\n290\n00:14:40.451 --> 00:14:43.551\nThis is an object, this is an object\nevent though we've been calling them\n\n291\n00:14:43.551 --> 00:14:46.166\nplaceholders and\ncontent placeholders and it's just text.\n\n292\n00:14:46.166 --> 00:14:48.035\nIt still lives in a box as I call it.\n\n293\n00:14:48.035 --> 00:14:55.020\nSo if I needed to, I could take this text\nhere within this content place holder.\n\n294\n00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:59.340\nI can cut this and now I have this\nparagraph in one content place holder.\n\n295\n00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.440\nI'm gonna click off.\n\n296\n00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.580\nI'm just gonna go ahead and paste.\n\n297\n00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:06.124\nIt's automatically going to give me\na text box but remember our wonderful,\n\n298\n00:15:06.124 --> 00:15:07.619\noops, before I forgot.\n\n299\n00:15:07.619 --> 00:15:08.511\nLet me do that again,\n\n300\n00:15:08.511 --> 00:15:11.490\ncuz I wanted to get that smart tag\neven though it's on top of it.\n\n301\n00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:15.400\nThe smart tag is important because\nit's using the destination theme.\n\n302\n00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:19.507\nBut I want to keep the source formatting,\nand it's gonna remember the font size and\n\n303\n00:15:19.507 --> 00:15:20.220\neverything.\n\n304\n00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.800\nSo I didn't want to have to reformat that.\n\n305\n00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.400\nI wanted to keep it what it was.\n\n306\n00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.100\nSo now I have this, I've got to look for\nmy four pointed arrows,\n\n307\n00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.080\neven though it's overlapping, always\nlook at your mouse [INAUDIBLE] icons.\n\n308\n00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.970\nI can move this over here.\n\n309\n00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:35.331\nI could take this, I'm gonna just\nresize this box a little bit,\n\n310\n00:15:35.331 --> 00:15:39.016\nlooks a little too much maybe cuz\nit's doing that auto sizing, okay.\n\n311\n00:15:39.016 --> 00:15:44.178\nAnd so I can move this down here,\nI can move this over here and\n\n312\n00:15:44.178 --> 00:15:50.390\nI can kind move this back over there,\nmake this box a little bit bigger.\n\n313\n00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.730\nYes, move the picture down, move this.\n\n314\n00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:58.070\nAnd so now I've kinda forced\nthe textwrap to happen.\n\n315\n00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:58.870\n&gt;&gt; Very clever.\n\n316\n00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:03.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now something as simple as this,\nit wasn't too difficult to do and\n\n317\n00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:07.580\nthe text lines up all beautifully so it's\nlike a perfect example of how to do this.\n\n318\n00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.736\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, man,\nit's like you planned this or something.\n\n319\n00:16:09.736 --> 00:16:10.604\n&gt;&gt; Kind of, right?\n\n320\n00:16:10.604 --> 00:16:12.667\n[LAUGH] I did make it, yes.\n\n321\n00:16:12.667 --> 00:16:14.570\nI did prep for this part.\n\n322\n00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.870\nBut I'm just trying to\ngive you the example\n\n323\n00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.110\nof you could kind of create textwrap.\n\n324\n00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.560\nYou just have to make\nit happen on your own.\n\n325\n00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.360\nJust object, object, object, placing it,\nand how it all kind of fits together.\n\n326\n00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.128\nSo that is textwrap in PowerPoint.\n\n327\n00:16:31.128 --> 00:16:35.887\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you're having to out think\nthe problem because of how the text\n\n328\n00:16:35.887 --> 00:16:38.360\nworks differently than the images.\n\n329\n00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:43.110\nAnd so just gotta get playful, try to move\nthings around try to get things to fit.\n\n330\n00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.962\nGet real creative with cut, copy, and\npaste, [LAUGH] stuff and you know what?\n\n331\n00:16:45.962 --> 00:16:48.120\nYou might be able to make it work.\n\n332\n00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.170\nSometimes it does,\nsometimes it doesn't and\n\n333\n00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:52.040\nthen you just have to go\nback to the drawing board.\n\n334\n00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.710\nBut that's the game sometimes.\n\n335\n00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:54.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and there's\n\n336\n00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.210\na few things that we just did in that\nwhere you saw these kind of lines,\n\n337\n00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:59.310\nthey got lined a little perfectly and\nI went a little fast.\n\n338\n00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:02.010\nWe do have a whole episode on shapes that\n\n339\n00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:06.080\nwhere we're gonna be talking about shapes\nbut it's really just objects in general.\n\n340\n00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:09.470\nSo all of those awesome auto\nalign features that I had.\n\n341\n00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.970\nCuz they just snapped right\nover there to the left.\n\n342\n00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.602\nI love those features and we will\ndefinitely be covering those in some later\n\n343\n00:17:14.602 --> 00:17:17.420\nepisodes in case you're like whoa,\nwhat are those things that just popped up.\n\n344\n00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.140\nYou're not saying anything.\n\n345\n00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:19.641\nI'll tell you all about it.\n\n346\n00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:23.433\n&gt;&gt; She does wanna give away\neverything in one spot, right?\n\n347\n00:17:23.433 --> 00:17:26.280\nWe've got to flesh these things out,\ngive everything its due.\n\n348\n00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.702\nSpeaking of which, Vonne,\nhave we given images its due?\n\n349\n00:17:29.702 --> 00:17:32.470\nAre we at the end, or do you have anything\nelse you need to add to this episode?\n\n350\n00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:33.970\n&gt;&gt; I believe we've covered everything and\n\n351\n00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.720\nwe are at the bottom of\nmy slide presentation.\n\n352\n00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.920\nSo we have covered everything.\n\n353\n00:17:37.920 -->

00:17:44.280\nA lot of cool features in there.\n\n356\n00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.840\nSo go in there, play with it.\n\n357\n00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.750\nStart messing around, see what you can\ndo to make a really cool looking slide.\n\n358\n00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:53.651\nAnd that will lend to your presentation\nmagic when it does happen, so\n\n359\n00:17:53.651 --> 00:17:55.960\nhopefully that's awesome for you.\n\n360\n00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.910\nThat being said, it does look like\nit is time for us to close the show.\n\n361\n00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.716\nSo, thank you very much for

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:13.944\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.944 --> 00:00:16.620\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.650\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are coming back with more,\n\n8\n00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.280\nobviously, of our PowerPoint 2016 series,\nit's been epic so far.\n\n9\n00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.318\nAnd to increase the epicness of that,\njoining us in the studio our good friend,\n\n10\n00:00:30.318 --> 00:00:31.500\nMs. Vonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.030\nVonne, welcome back, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.653\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; Epic, you should have said [LAUGH].\n\n13\n00:00:35.653 --> 00:00:38.960\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is so epic I don't know\nwhat to do with myself [LAUGH].\n\n14\n00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.370\nBut continuing on our epicness,\nyes, Design Themes.\n\n15\n00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.470\nDesign themes, they're great,\nand they're easy, they're so\n\n16\n00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.700\nnice to be able to go ahead and say take\nour kind of boring Power Point, so far.\n\n17\n00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.432\nI say so far.\n\n18\n00:00:51.432 --> 00:00:52.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You made some real\n\n19\n00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.280\ngarbage there Vonne.\n\n20\n00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.570\n&gt;&gt; Well, because I've been using just a\nwhite slide with black text and that's it.\n\n21\n00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.700\nI haven't been doing anything else to make\nthem look fancy or appealing to the eye,\n\n22\n00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.580\nbecause I've been waiting for\nthis episode to be able to show you them.\n\n23\n00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.100\nAnd so,\nwhy don't we show you this awesomeness and\n\n24\n00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.040\nget into Format Slides and Themes.\n\n25\n00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.540\nI have a PowerPoint Presentation ready\nto go, and so you've seen this so far.\n\n26\n00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.520\nIf you're watching in order,\nyou're like, yes,\n\n27\n00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.940\nhere is another white slide with black\ntext and that's it, nothing else.\n\n28\n00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.090\nOkay, I did throw a couple of-\n&gt;&gt; There's some colors in there.\n\n29\n00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.850\n&gt;&gt; Colored squares in there.\n\n30\n00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.920\nYeah, so now we haven't done shapes yet,\n\n31\n00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.820\nif again if you're doing in linear\norder but we will be adding shapes.\n\n32\n00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.250\nBut the reason why I wanted to add these\nparticular squares with these colors\n\n33\n00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.770\nis because what does a theme do?\n\n34\n00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.250\nThink about like a party, My Little Pony,\n\n35\n00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.870\nwe've been talking a lot about the 80s,-\n&gt;&gt; We have.\n\n36\n00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.790\n&gt;&gt; In between our shows.\n\n37\n00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.790\n&gt;&gt; We have.\n&gt;&gt; And all the different things that we\n\n38\n00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.900\nloved about the 80s, cuz we kind of are\n&gt;&gt; Products of that.\n\n39\n00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.510\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I know I had a My Little Pony party\n\n40\n00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.270\nat one point.\n\n41\n00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.180\nAnd so everything was pink and purple,\nand there was lots of glitter everywhere.\n\n42\n00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.020\nSo you had to buy the cups and\nthe plates and everything.\n\n43\n00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.750\nThe cake was that way,\nit had little toys on it.\n\n44\n00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm digressing [LAUGH]\n\n45\n00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.120\n&gt;&gt; You were really taking a step back\n\n46\n00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.922\ninto time, weren't you?\n\n47\n00:02:05.922 --> 00:02:07.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\nof course it was at the skating rink\n\n48\n00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.170\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's nice.\n\n49\n00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.225\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, it's gotta have your birthday\nparty at the roller skating rink, okay so.\n\n50\n00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:17.640\n[LAUGH] But the whole idea about having\nthese themed birthday parties just goes\n\n51\n00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.800\nalong the same lines here with creating or\napplying a design theme in PowerPoint.\n\n52\n00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.790\nIt's gonna go ahead and\n\n53\n00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.700\nchange all of your fonts, colors,\nthat when I say graphics that means\n\n54\n00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.600\nlike all of the different default styles\nthat you can apply to your pictures.\n\n55\n00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.570\nIn our previous episodes, photographs or\nimages we had the styles and\n\n56\n00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.040\nhow it changed the outlines and\neverything, that design theme will\n\n57\n00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.850\naffect the default styles of everything,\nso that's what I mean by graphics.\n\n58\n00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.040\nAnd then the layout defaults, all of\nthe layouts that we have been doing here,\n\n59\n00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.650\nif we had our content and\ncaption our to content.\n\n60\n00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.130\nIf you viewed the episode\nabout adding slides,\n\n61\n00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.260\nI did apply a design theme to some\nslides and it showed that there was\n\n62\n00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.000\na lot more options for\nlayouts with a specific design theme.\n\n63\n00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.310\nSo that controls everything within\nyour PowerPoint presentation.\n\n64\n00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.030\nWhen it comes to the looks,\nnot the content, but\n\n65\n00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.360\nhow it formats all of your content.\n\n66\n00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.330\nNow where do you go to\napply design themes?\n\n67\n00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.890\nWell you go over to the design tab.\n\n68\n00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.940\nOn the design tab we have all of\nthese different parts right here,\n\n69\n00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.200\nyou can click through them\non the right hand side but\n\n70\n00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.240\nthere is this little pull down\nicon here that will go ahead and\n\n71\n00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.370\ngive you all of the different presentation\nthemes that is in this particular program.\n\n72\n00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.660\nNow you see that there is a custom because\nI was kind of playing around with this.\n\n73\n00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.640\nAnd I will show you how you will be able\nto create your own custom, you will not\n\n74\n00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.690\nhave purple feathers as a design theme\nin your PowerPoint because I made that.\n\n75\n00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.900\nBut more to come on that,\nin just a second.\n\n76\n00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.640\nWe have all these,\nthey do have different names on them.\n\n77\n00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.510\nSo if I wanted to, let's say,\nI'll pick on this one,\n\n78\n00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.850\ncuz it's purple, and I look purple.\n\n79\n00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.840\nWe're talking about My Little Pony,\nanyways.\n\n80\n00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.250\nSo I go to the ion board room,\nand then it goes ahead and\n\n81\n00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.270\ntakes every single one of my slides,\nand it formats them.\n\n82\n00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.550\nNotice how my Title slide is formatted\ndifferently than my title and\n\n83\n00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.400\ncontent slide.\n\n84\n00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.250\nMy section layout, it has all of\nthese different looks and feels.\n\n85\n00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.450\nAnd to me it's just like instantly\ntakes your presentation and\n\n86\n00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.670\nmakes it look neater and looks cooler.\n\n87\n00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.066\nAnd you can just say, that's perfect, slap\ndesign theme on it and you're ready to go.\n\n88\n00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:37.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean it could be done by right there.\n\n89\n00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.920\nBut, what if I-\n&gt;&gt; It does look nice.\n\n90\n00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.489\n&gt;&gt; It does look nice [LAUGH] right.\n\n91\n00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:45.133\nAnd it really is simple, in a sense,\nthat they have some really nice,\n\n92\n00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:48.380\nprofessional, stylistic looking themes.\n\n93\n00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.830\nThat, if I click on them,\nI really like this one,\n\n94\n00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.800\nI'm kind of a fan of geometric shapes and\neverything.\n\n95\n00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.850\nThis was the one that we had in\nour Learn PowerPoint presentation\n\n96\n00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.870\nin some of our first episodes.\n\n97\n00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.020\nSo it controls everything, and\nI think they're beautiful and\n\n98\n00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.280\nI really would like to go.\n\n99\n00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.220\nAnd if you just click on it,\nit's just gonna go ahead and\n\n100\n00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.460\napply to all the slides by default.\n\n101\n00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.360\nNow, if you thinking about the theme\nI would say you would probably\n\n102\n00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.455\nwant to be consistent throughout all of\nyour slides to have the same design theme.\n\n103\n00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:25.445\nBut if for any reason,\nyou really wanted this particular slide or\n\n104\n00:05:25.445 --> 00:05:26.435\na couple of slides.\n\n105\n00:05:26.435 --> 00:05:30.395\nYou could always use your Shift key and\nselect multiple slides in there.\n\n106\n00:05:30.395 --> 00:05:34.195\nTo say I want the selected slides\nto have a different theme.\n\n107\n00:05:34.195 --> 00:05:37.080\nLet's say this one right here,\ncelestial theme.\n\n108\n00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.535\nI can right-click, not left-click,\nbut if you right-click over this,\n\n109\n00:05:41.535 --> 00:05:45.850\nyou get the option of where you\ncould apply this to selected slides.\n\n110\n00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.680\nAnd whatever slide you have selected we'll\ngo ahead and have that scene applied to,\n\n111\n00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.680\nbut now, now you're kind of,\nyou're mixing too much stuff together,\n\n112\n00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.090\nright there, in my opinion.\n\n113\n00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.478\nBut there could be specific reasons,\n\n114\n00:05:59.478 --> 00:06:04.328\nespecially if you had maybe the same\nTheme but maybe a slight variation on it,\n\n115\n00:06:04.328 --> 00:06:09.252\nthen that's where I could say that I\ncould see where would be appropriate, but\n\n116\n00:06:09.252 --> 00:06:13.983\nevery rule is meant to be broken so it's\nup to you on how you want to do it but.\n\n117\n00:06:13.983 --> 00:06:14.753\n&gt;&gt; These are all guideline.\n\n118\n00:06:14.753 --> 00:06:15.323\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n119\n00:06:15.323 --> 00:06:19.630\n[LAUGH] And it's just right click to\nselect To apply to select and size,\n\n120\n00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.640\nI'm gonna do undo that for\njust a little bit.\n\n121\n00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.990\nBecause once I go ahead and\napply design theme, I like this but\n\n122\n00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.370\nmaybe I wanted it to be a different\ncolor maybe a different font.\n\n123\n00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.590\nA whole font scheme,\nyou have over here your variants and\n\n124\n00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.110\nif I click on this, this drop down notice\nthat you could have the same look but\n\n125\n00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.040\nmaybe in a kind of pink and purple.\n\n126\n00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.780\nColor scheme or maybe, and they have some\nother variations in here that are ready to\n\n127\n00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.230\ngo where I'll look now all of the slides\nhave like a darker background\n\n128\n00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.430\nin this variant if you wanted it.\n\n129\n00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.330\nAnd then I could say,\nwell, I like that but\n\n130\n00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.800\nI want to have a whole different\nfont scheme over here.\n\n131\n00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.336\nMaybe I wanted to have a trebuchet,\none of my favorite fonts.\n\n132\n00:07:01.336 --> 00:07:04.360\nSo I have a trebuchet,\nI have maybe a darker background.\n\n133\n00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.640\nYou can even go a little\nmore with background styles.\n\n134\n00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.740\nYou could have your background have\nmore like a gradient effect on it,\n\n135\n00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.510\nmaybe lighter or darker.\n\n136\n00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:19.750\nIt's trying to pick different options\nthat are going to go well together.\n\n137\n00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.640\nSo maybe I like, hm okay.\n\n138\n00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.961\nIt's a little dark for my taste.\n\n139\n00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:29.810\n[LAUGH] Maybe this variation of my\nstarting theme is what I really like,\n\n140\n00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.600\nand you don't wanna have to remember like,\nokay I changed the font and\n\n141\n00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.990\nI changed some of the colors,\nI changed the variations.\n\n142\n00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.710\nI like this just make it my own theme.\n\n143\n00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.475\n&gt;&gt; So it becomes the DNA\nof the presentation itself?\n\n144\n00:07:42.475 --> 00:07:43.850\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So every slide that goes in.\n\n145\n00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.640\nThen kinda gets that DNA.\n\n146\n00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.360\n&gt;&gt; Yes and I don't wanna have to\nremember how I did the gene sequencing.\n\n147\n00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.895\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Of that DNA,\nso I can save my own themes, so\n\n148\n00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:53.951\nI've comeback over here and\ngo to this little drop down.\n\n149\n00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:56.139\nRight there were says save current them.\n\n150\n00:07:56.139 --> 00:08:00.437\nThat's how I got this Purple feathers,\nI made that, so\n\n151\n00:08:00.437 --> 00:08:05.467\nI can take something to start with,\ndo some variations on it, and\n\n152\n00:08:05.467 --> 00:08:11.622\nthen save it for yourself, and I can\nname it, we're gonna say, Dark Shadows.\n\n153\n00:08:11.622 --> 00:08:16.657\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Isn't that a show from the 80s?\n\n154\n00:08:16.657 --> 00:08:17.167\n&gt;&gt; It is, isn't it?\n\n155\n00:08:17.167 --> 00:08:17.721\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n156\n00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:19.249\n&gt;&gt; Is that what just\nsubconsciously came out of my\n\n157\n00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:20.560\nbrain cuz we were talking about this?\n\n158\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.860\n&gt;&gt; I think it's from the 80s,\nit might have been the 70s.\n\n159\n00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.500\n&gt;&gt; I know it was a show and\nit just reminded me about that so.\n\n160\n00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.590\n&gt;&gt; I gotta look it up now.\n\n161\n00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.405\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, do that.\n\n162\n00:08:28.405 --> 00:08:33.140\n[LAUGH] So I have it Dark Shadows,\ndo take notice of where it's being saved,\n\n163\n00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:39.140\nif I go all the way back in here, look,\nit's in this particular user that I have\n\n164\n00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:45.160\non my Mac, on my library, in the office,\nall the way down into the themes folder.\n\n165\n00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.690\nAnd those from the one that I had\nsaved before is that purple.thmx,\n\n166\n00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.490\nso don't change the location\nof it cuz that way,\n\n167\n00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:58.190\nit will go in a theme folder and\nthis is part of PowerPoint now.\n\n168\n00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:02.339\nI could open up a new presentation, go to\nthe design themes, and it's gonna have all\n\n169\n00:09:02.339 --> 00:09:06.146\nof those custom themes that I've saved for\nme to be able to access it anytime.\n\n170\n00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:10.946\nSo I would say, wherever it goes, keep it,\nand so if I save it, now you can see,\n\n171\n00:09:10.946 --> 00:09:15.700\njust brought up my purple, but\nit has this presentation, there it goes.\n\n172\n00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.851\nNow in my custom section,\nI have my dark shadows and\n\n173\n00:09:18.851 --> 00:09:23.470\nmy purple feathers from last time,\nbecause this started with one place and\n\n174\n00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:28.119\nthen I went onto it, wow, I guess I was\non this dark thing going on, right?\n\n175\n00:09:28.119 --> 00:09:31.083\nSo I have some more\ndark-looking themes but\n\n176\n00:09:31.083 --> 00:09:36.383\nit's nice that you can be able to start\nand then change it to whatever you want.\n\n177\n00:09:36.383 --> 00:09:38.920\n&gt;&gt;

Really?\n&gt;&gt; 66 through 71, but I'm sure we watched\n\n181\n00:09:48.143 --> 00:09:52.820\nreruns of it long ago because I remember-\n&gt;&gt; There must be some other iteration of\n\n182\n00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:57.230\nit, I feel like it's a little bit more\nfamiliar, but hey, we'll roll with it.\n\n183\n00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.880\n&gt;&gt; You can't fight facts,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n184\n00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.682\n&gt;&gt; I know, you can't argue with\nthe internet, that's for sure.\n\n185\n00:10:00.682 --> 00:10:01.844\n&gt;&gt;

Have my little ponies all around it.\n\n203\n00:10:58.547 --> 00:11:01.065\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, we could do that.\n\n204\n00:11:01.065 --> 00:11:02.335\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we can.\n\n205\n00:11:02.335 --> 00:11:04.345\n&gt;&gt; But in this one, since it's\ncopyrighted, we'll we don't wanna-\n\n206\n00:11:04.345 --> 00:11:05.462\n&gt;&gt; We don't wanna get a cease and\n\n207\n00:11:05.462 --> 00:11:06.138\ndesist in there.\n\n208\n00:11:06.138 --> 00:11:07.152\n&gt;&gt;

Yes it is,\nI was pretty sure about that but\n\n214\n00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:22.065\nI've always gotten to it by right clicking\non the slide, you have the format\n\n215\n00:11:22.065 --> 00:11:25.360\nbackground and then you have the task band\nthat comes up over here on the right.\n\n216\n00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.160\nAnd you have all sorts of different\noptions, Solid, I think that's\n\n217\n00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.680\nself explanatory, you can come down\nhere and pick the colors you want.\n\n218\n00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.205\nI can pick the nice pink color right\nthere, that is some pink, right?\n\n219\n00:11:37.205 --> 00:11:41.640\n[LAUGH] And\nif I want to dim it down a little bit,\n\n220\n00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:46.620\nwe can take the transparency and we can\nmake that a little bit more see-through.\n\n221\n00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.220\nBut it's not really making\nit a lighter color pink,\n\n222\n00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.430\nit's just making it more see-through.\n\n223\n00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:53.790\n&gt;&gt; Which is white behind it.\n\n224\n00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.779\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So, there's your pinkish.\n\n225\n00:11:55.779 --> 00:11:59.694\nYeah, there you go, and\nwasn't that the whole pink thing?\n\n226\n00:11:59.694 --> 00:12:00.882\n&gt;&gt; Yes, don't get that started,\n\n227\n00:12:00.882 --> 00:12:03.278\nnow, that's a conversation you\nguys don't wanna be a part of.\n\n228\n00:12:03.278 --> 00:12:05.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if I wanted to have it for\n\n229\n00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.090\nhere, I could have it for just this\none slide, go to the next slide and\n\n230\n00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.130\ndo something different.\n\n231\n00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.840\nBut keeping with that whole consistency\nif you click the Apply to all button,\n\n232\n00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.220\nit will go ahead and well, do it right\nthere and the Apply to all button,\n\n233\n00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.660\nby the way, it's behind my head,\nright there, there's the Apply to all.\n\n234\n00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.864\nAnd we can keep on moving\nthrough some of our options,\n\n235\n00:12:23.864 --> 00:12:27.270\nwe can go to our Gradient fill,\nnow what is a gradient?\n\n236\n00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:31.282\nColors that gradiate with each other,\nthat's not a real word, I don't think,\n\n237\n00:12:31.282 --> 00:12:32.406\nthey blend together.\n\n238\n00:12:32.406 --> 00:12:34.135\n&gt;&gt; Just go with it.\n\n239\n00:12:34.135 --> 00:12:37.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I have some different\npresets here and this is of course,\n\n240\n00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.630\nstill based on my theme, just bringing\nup those office themed colors and\n\n241\n00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.620\nI can go from light to dark,\ndark to light.\n\n242\n00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.750\nIf I picked let's say, this orange and\n\n243\n00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.900\nthis is a pretty easy one,\nwhat a gradient does is,\n\n244\n00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:54.350\nyou have a gradient ramp and you have\ndifferent stops along that gradient ramp.\n\n245\n00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.910\nI call them houses cuz\nthey look like houses and\n\n246\n00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.160\nthat's what you have down\nhere on your gradient stops.\n\n247\n00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.560\nIf you have this white\nto white to orange and\n\n248\n00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:07.040\nthen it's gonna go ahead and blend\ntogether where those houses are located.\n\n249\n00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.980\nBut the type of gradient, you're gonna\nhave a radial, you're gonna have a linear\n\n250\n00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:16.001\nwhich will be more of a line,\nyou're gonna have a rectangular, and\n\n251\n00:13:16.001 --> 00:13:19.200\nyou can play around with\nthe different types in here.\n\n252\n00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.249\nBut going down to the direction\nright below it is,\n\n253\n00:13:22.249 --> 00:13:25.190\nwhere is that radial\ngradient starting from?\n\n254\n00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:30.440\nFrom the corner, from the middle, so\nyou can pick where the middle part,\n\n255\n00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.680\nor where the blending is coming\nfrom with your directions.\n\n256\n00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.198\nThe other cool thing is like maybe, I\ndon't want it to go from orange to white,\n\n257\n00:13:39.198 --> 00:13:42.293\nwhat if I wanted it to go from\nyellow to pink to orange?\n\n258\n00:13:42.293 --> 00:13:47.092\nThat might be a little too much, but you\ncan come into each one of these houses,\n\n259\n00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:50.490\nand you see how it puts\na little box around the house.\n\n260\n00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.620\nIt outlines the house to know which\ncolor stop that you are on, so\n\n261\n00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.680\nyou pick the house that you wanna change,\nyou come down here to the color picker and\n\n262\n00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.010\nthen, you could go ahead and\npick whatever color you want to have.\n\n263\n00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:05.610\nMaybe I want to go with yellow,\nand then that one is yellow,\n\n264\n00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.770\ncuz I think I want yellow\nto pink to orange.\n\n265\n00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:11.030\nSo then you go ahead and pick the next\nhouse, and then you could go ahead and\n\n266\n00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:15.595\nchange the color there, wow,\nthat's getting a little scary.\n\n267\n00:14:15.595 --> 00:14:20.530\n[LAUGH] But maybe I don't want that\nhouse anymore, I don't want it to go\n\n268\n00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:24.090\nfrom yellow to pink to orange, I just\nwant it to go from yellow to orange.\n\n269\n00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:28.294\nYou could take this house that I\nhave selected, and there's the + and\n\n270\n00:14:28.294 --> 00:14:32.780\nthe- buttons, and\nI could remove that house from the ramp.\n\n271\n00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:38.230\nJust the same way, I also could show\nyou that you can move the houses,\n\n272\n00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.810\nyou can drag the houses\nalong your gradient ramp and\n\n273\n00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:44.600\nyou can add some more houses,\nyou can move these around.\n\n274\n00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.610\nSo you can start getting really creative\nwith the types of colors that you're\n\n275\n00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.770\ndoing here, some colors don't blend\nreally well together at least in my\n\n276\n00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:58.180\nmind like orange to blue.\n\n277\n00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.551\n&gt;&gt; Looks like the sun in the sky.\n\n278\n00:14:59.551 --> 00:15:02.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does,\n&gt;&gt; Yes it does, isn't it?\n\n279\n00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.816\nI didn't even plan that,\nbut I think orange and\n\n280\n00:15:06.816 --> 00:15:11.898\nblue doesn't blend as nicely,\nif say, yellow to orange,\n\n281\n00:15:11.898 --> 00:15:15.779\nyellow to pink actually\nblends pretty good.\n\n282\n00:15:15.779 --> 00:15:19.269\nAnd then pink to blue blends pretty well,\nat least to me,\n\n283\n00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:22.343\nsince we're talking about\nour My Little Ponies.\n\n284\n00:15:22.343 --> 00:15:25.940\n&gt;&gt; It looks very Eastery or\nspringtime-ish.\n\n285\n00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.426\n&gt;&gt; Yes, little rainbows going on here,\nyes, I always tend to go towards\n\n286\n00:15:29.426 --> 00:15:33.166\nthe rainbows, so we have our different\ngradient stops and we can go ahead.\n\n287\n00:15:33.166 --> 00:15:36.126\nNow all of these different\ncontrols down here,\n\n288\n00:15:36.126 --> 00:15:39.456\nthe position, transparency,\nand brightness is for\n\n289\n00:15:39.456 --> 00:15:43.830\nwhatever house or gradient stock\nthat you have as your active house.\n\n290\n00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:46.750\nSo, you can control these even\nmore from there, and from here,\n\n291\n00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:51.640\nI can go ahead and apply to all, gosh,\nthat is starting to hurt my eyeballs.\n\n292\n00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.034\n&gt;&gt; Don't stare directly at the slide.\n\n293\n00:15:53.034 --> 00:15:55.880\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes, so you could go through and\n\n294\n00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.919\nchange all of these different things\nwith the formatting Background.\n\n295\n00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:06.690\nAll right, so let's kinda go ahead and\nmove on to other options that we can do.\n\n296\n00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:13.711\nI'm going to close this because I'm trying\nto get back to all of my original pickers,\n\n297\n00:16:13.711 --> 00:16:18.207\nand I can't find, there it is,\n[LAUGH] scroll up.\n\n298\n00:16:18.207 --> 00:16:18.937\n&gt;&gt;

They could still be all right bone.\n\n337\n00:18:09.934 --> 00:18:11.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we'll go with that,\n\n338\n00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:14.490\nbut I'm not sure why you would\never wanna have a fossilized\n\n339\n00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:18.196\ndish background but-\n&gt;&gt; We're doing a prehistoric kind of\n\n340\n00:18:18.196 --> 00:18:21.678\nthemed, maybe you're an archeologist or\nsomething.\n\n341\n00:18:21.678 --> 00:18:24.643\n&gt;&gt; That's the best\nexplanation I've ever heard.\n\n342\n00:18:24.643 --> 00:18:27.231\n[LAUGH] So,\nyou have the different premade texture it,\n\n343\n00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:30.505\nthese have been in here since-\n&gt;&gt; Since PowerPoint began.\n\n344\n00:18:30.505 --> 00:18:33.766\n&gt;&gt; Seriously, I think I was-\n&gt;&gt; You're unearthing PowerPoint [LAUGH]\n\n345\n00:18:33.766 --> 00:18:36.313\nand using this slide\nto show what they did.\n\n346\n00:18:36.313 --> 00:18:39.286\n&gt;&gt; I think it was PowerPoint from 2002.\n\n347\n00:18:39.286 --> 00:18:40.381\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that was way back.\n\n348\n00:18:40.381 --> 00:18:44.525\n&gt;&gt; And that's when I remember this,\nteaching it that far back, so\n\n349\n00:18:44.525 --> 00:18:46.080\nthat was fun.\n\n350\n00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.340\nEven maybe 2000,\nmight even go back that far.\n\n351\n00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.720\nAll right, so if you wanted to\nuse some of the pictures or\n\n352\n00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.710\nthe textures you could do that.\n\n353\n00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.300\nOr what if I have my own picture?\n\n354\n00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.310\nAnd this is where, back on that\nepisode that we did about images,\n\n355\n00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:01.650\nif you wanted it to make sure that it\nstretches across your entire slide,\n\n356\n00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.126\nyou do need to make sure you have\na picture that's big enough to begin with.\n\n357\n00:19:05.126 --> 00:19:09.682\nAnd I do have over here on my desktop\nsome pictures and if I go with the,\n\n358\n00:19:09.682 --> 00:19:14.632\nwell, we'll go with flower large, and\nif I go ahead and insert that then,\n\n359\n00:19:14.632 --> 00:19:18.670\nthat makes the entire picture go ahead and\ngo across my site.\n\n360\n00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:21.640\nReally, you know, it's nice looking,\nit's high quality and\n\n361\n00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.100\nif it's a little too bright you can always\nkind of dim that down a little bit with\n\n362\n00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:30.270\nyour transparency and so, you have one\nimage that fills up your entire slide.\n\n363\n00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.700\nBut if you wanted,\nif you had a smaller picture,\n\n364\n00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.260\nlike I'm going to that flower small and\nI'm going to insert.\n\n365\n00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.160\nNow, if you see here you can already see-\n&gt;&gt; Here's the problem.\n\n366\n00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nit doesn't look good, does it?\n\n367\n00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:44.685\nWell, if I take that and tile the picture\nas a texture, since it is smaller,\n\n368\n00:19:44.685 --> 00:19:49.440\nhere let me bring the transparency\ndown a little bit so you can see it.\n\n369\n00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.195\nThis is where if you did want to tile,\nhaving a smaller image is going to be\n\n370\n00:19:53.195 --> 00:19:56.459\nbetter then, a larger image\nbecause a larger image, tiling,\n\n371\n00:19:56.459 --> 00:19:59.067\nis not going to fit because\nit's already too big.\n\n372\n00:19:59.067 --> 00:20:03.537\nAnd then, you can kind of do some cute\nthings with like the mirroring, you can do\n\n373\n00:20:03.537 --> 00:20:06.460\nwhere it kinda changes how it, well-\n&gt;&gt; Kinda\n\n374\n00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.850\nlooks like a kaleidoscope\nof small pictures.\n\n375\n00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.370\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's not just a straight\nup and down mirroring tile you can\n\n376\n00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:13.110\nmirror it both-\n&gt;&gt; You\n\n377\n00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:16.741\nprobably gonna wanna rethink that black\ntext at this point, though [LAUGH].\n\n378\n00:20:16.741 --> 00:20:17.700\n&gt;&gt; Probably, yeah.\n\n379\n00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:22.010\nAnd you can change the offsets of\nhow much it moves up and down.\n\n380\n00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:25.180\nYou can also scale this,\nif I wanted it to be even smaller.\n\n381\n00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.560\n&gt;&gt; It's like fractal art now [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n382\n00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.185\nWe're getting a little trippy here.\n\n383\n00:20:29.185 --> 00:20:33.210\n[LAUGH] So, you could go ahead and change\nall of those different parameters if\n\n384\n00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:38.182\nyou would like to, I'm not sure you\nwould want to sit through an entire\n\n385\n00:20:38.182 --> 00:20:39.758\npresentation with-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n386\n00:20:39.758 --> 00:20:42.430\n&gt;&gt; With tiled flowers that might start\n\n387\n00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:46.490\nhurting a little bit as like,\nyeah, that's a little to much.\n\n388\n00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:49.795\nDoing this tastefully,\nit's always the name of the game.\n\n389\n00:20:49.795 --> 00:20:54.195\nKnow your audience and know that would\nyou wanna look at that for 15, 20,\n\n390\n00:20:54.195 --> 00:20:56.205\n30, an hour long?\n\n391\n00:20:56.205 --> 00:20:58.825\n&gt;&gt; If you do,\nthen we need to get you some medical help.\n\n392\n00:20:58.825 --> 00:20:59.325\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n393\n00:20:59.325 --> 00:21:01.335\n&gt;&gt; That might be a little much.\n\n394\n00:21:01.335 --> 00:21:04.235\nAlong those same slides,\ndo you really wanna choose a pattern fill?\n\n395\n00:21:05.875 --> 00:21:07.485\n&gt;&gt; Wow, yeah.\n\n396\n00:21:07.485 --> 00:21:08.015\n&gt;&gt; And then,\n\n397\n00:21:08.015 --> 00:21:12.500\nyou throw another color in there and-\n&gt;&gt; That's when that reset\n\n398\n00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.560\nthing starts coming in real handy,\ndoesn't it?\n\n399\n00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:19.340\n&gt;&gt; Or just, let's apply just a solid\nwhite background, that'd be nice.\n\n400\n00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:21.380\n[LAUGH] So, you could go through and\n\n401\n00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:25.190\nsay, let's go back to a nice,\nsoothing, light orange.\n\n402\n00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:26.918\nAnd we'll apply, okay, that's so\n\n403\n00:21:26.918 --> 00:21:29.610\nnice [LAUGH] so,\nwe can go through the different options.\n\n404\n00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:33.510\nThe hide background graphics, that's not\nreally going to apply to us right now, but\n\n405\n00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:38.830\nif you get into design themes, for\nexample here, this first slide,\n\n406\n00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:43.700\nit does have background graphics\nthat are part of the slide master,\n\n407\n00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.230\nwhich we will get into in another show.\n\n408\n00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:50.530\nIf you hide that series, it's actually,\nwell, hiding the graphics\n\n409\n00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:54.410\nthat are usually going to be\nassociated with a theme that you have.\n\n410\n00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.390\nSo, that's what that check box is.\n\n411\n00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.390\nIf you had gone, if we hadn't had a theme,\neverything we were doing before,\n\n412\n00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:01.770\nit wouldn't apply,\nit wouldn't make any difference.\n\n413\n00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:05.670\nSo, you can go through your\nHide Background options.\n\n414\n00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.170\nFew more things to cover, the slide size.\n\n415\n00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.840\nYou do need to make sure that\nyou know what aspect ratio\n\n416\n00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.150\nyou're going to be presenting your slides.\n\n417\n00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:20.070\nI know this is a big thing, my former\n\n418\n00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:24.590\nemployment that they had it\nas I think it was 16 by nine,\n\n419\n00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:28.930\nbut everything was four by three in\nthe place that they were doing it.\n\n420\n00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.558\nIt was a really big screen and\nall the slides looked really wrong.\n\n421\n00:22:31.558 --> 00:22:35.716\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Changing this from either a four by\n\n422\n00:22:35.716 --> 00:22:38.900\nthree or to a 16 by nine,\nit will make a difference.\n\n423\n00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.679\nIt's kinda going from when we went from\n\n424\n00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:45.754\nthe wide format back from the 4:3 to 16:9,\nyeah.\n\n425\n00:22:45.754 --> 00:22:48.670\n&gt;&gt; So, it's probably a good idea, like,\nif you know you're gonna be bouncing from\n\n426\n00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:52.170\nvenue to venue, you don't know what aspect\nratio you're gonna be displaying on.\n\n427\n00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.110\nMaybe a good idea to make it in both,\nright?\n\n428\n00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:55.790\nJust copy it in and\nchange the aspect ratio.\n\n429\n00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:58.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if I change this to standard,\nnow it's like, okay, well,\n\n430\n00:22:58.670 --> 00:22:59.550\nwhat do you wanna do?\n\n431\n00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:02.960\nYou're converting to a smaller,\ndo you want me to scale down everything?\n\n432\n00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.210\nI would just say, yes, and so\n\n433\n00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.520\nit just scales everything\ndown into that four by three.\n\n434\n00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.325\nIt might even look a little weird-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, it does.\n\n435\n00:23:10.325 --> 00:23:11.462\n&gt;&gt; Like right it kinda\nlooks weird to my eye.\n\n436\n00:23:11.462 --> 00:23:12.340\n&gt;&gt; What happened?\n\n437\n00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.330\nIt was so good and now it's bad.\n\n438\n00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:16.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you change\nthe resolution on your monitor and\n\n439\n00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.030\nyou're like, it's taking awhile for\nmy eyes to adjust.\n\n440\n00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:22.040\nI had a really wide monitor and\npeople were like, how do you see?\n\n441\n00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.440\nI'm like, I don't know, it looks fine\nto me, so you start getting used to it.\n\n442\n00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:31.520\nEven though I'm such a stickler for things\nthat are stretched or not that right way,\n\n443\n00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:35.660\npretty used to it, that's all I had so,\n[LAUGH] I went with it.\n\n444\n00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.400\nBut changing the slide size,\n\n445\n00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:42.140\nslide size, that's a hard one to say,\nit's a good place to point out.\n\n446\n00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.080\nThe last thing on this design tab is the\ndesign ideas but I have another file that\n\n447\n00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:52.990\nI'd like show you the design ideas,\nI've really liked the design ideas.\n\n448\n00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:54.540\nIt's in mirror feature.\n\n449\n00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:58.296\nThis is something that is\navailable to your Office 365.\n\n450\n00:23:58.296 --> 00:24:02.396\nAccount holders,\nif you have a locally installed, like,\n\n451\n00:24:02.396 --> 00:24:05.020\npurchased PowerPoint 2016, and\n\n452\n00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:10.350\nyou're not an Office 365 subscriber,\nthis will not be available to you.\n\n453\n00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.120\nWhat does it do?\n\n454\n00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:15.550\nIt gives you ideas to design your slide.\n\n455\n00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.728\nI'm going to turn this on.\nI'm going to come over here and that,\n\n456\n00:24:17.728 --> 00:24:20.627\nif you're watching the images\nthat kept popping up on the side,\n\n457\n00:24:20.627 --> 00:24:23.160\nthis works really well with your images.\n\n458\n00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.879\nBut if I go over here to Design Ideas,\n\n459\n00:24:24.879 --> 00:24:27.707\nit's actually pulling out to\nthe Internet and saying well,\n\n460\n00:24:27.707 --> 00:24:31.436\nlet me give you some new ideas, and I just\nthink these are really slick looking.\n\n461\n00:24:31.436 --> 00:24:34.394\n&gt;&gt; Are these maybe professionals\nin the field that say,\n\n462\n00:24:34.394 --> 00:24:37.680\nhere's what's popular as far\nas presentational ideas and\n\n463\n00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.036\nthen kind of collaborate with Microsoft\nand then they put that inside of here?\n\n464\n00:24:42.036 --> 00:24:42.686\n&gt;&gt; That sounds great.\n\n465\n00:24:42.686 --> 00:24:44.552\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Honestly, I really don't know.\n\n466\n00:24:44.552 --> 00:24:45.399\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, okay.\n\n467\n00:24:45.399 --> 00:24:47.581\n&gt;&gt; I do know that it does\ncome from Microsoft and it,\n\n468\n00:24:47.581 --> 00:24:49.658\nbecause it is part of\nthe whole subscription,\n\n469\n00:24:49.658 --> 00:24:52.695\nthe whole reason why you have\na subscription is to be able to get those\n\n470\n00:24:52.695 --> 00:24:56.590\nsmall iterations of those upgrades and\nupdates that they have in the product.\n\n471\n00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:01.500\nSo if you have your updates, your Design\nIdeas, they might have some new ideas.\n\n472\n00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.864\nAnd so it is growing, it is newer, and\nso it will start to kinda get more.\n\n473\n00:25:05.864 --> 00:25:08.830\nI'm sure they have consultants\nwho are working on that.\n\n474\n00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:09.790\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure, yeah.\n\n475\n00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:14.050\n&gt;&gt; I mean, I just think that it looks new.\n\n476\n00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:15.699\n&gt;&gt; Some professional put this together.\n\n477\n00:25:15.699 --> 00:25:16.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n478\n00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.940\nit's just got some modern look and\nfeel, and\n\n479\n00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:23.330\nthat whole kinda easy flat design that\neverybody's going with right now.\n\n480\n00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:24.775\nIt's just, I don't know,\nI really like these.\n\n481\n00:25:24.775 --> 00:25:29.670\nNow, if you take a slide like this,\nit's taking the picture.\n\n482\n00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.330\nLook at the difference right there.\n\n483\n00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:34.390\nI mean, it's so simple, but that looks so\n\n484\n00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:38.610\nmuch cleaner and\nmore professional that what I had.\n\n485\n00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:42.930\nAnd just using the whole picture as a\nbackground, I think that looks fantastic.\n\n486\n00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.079\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, I really,\n\n487\n00:25:44.079 --> 00:25:45.745\nreally liked the Design Ideas.\n\n488\n00:25:45.745 --> 00:25:50.658\nAnd the more content you have, here, the\nstuff that it can do with the pictures,\n\n489\n00:25:50.658 --> 00:25:54.100\nlike that right there-\n&gt;&gt; That's cool, yeah.\n\n490\n00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.058\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nIt's so simple, it's just blocks,\n\n491\n00:25:56.058 --> 00:25:56.928\nit's just squares.\n\n492\n00:25:56.928 --> 00:26:00.699\n[LAUGH] But it looks so\nclean and so hip and new and\n\n493\n00:26:00.699 --> 00:26:04.200\nwith the times that's going on right now.\n\n494\n00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.350\nNow this slide right here.\n\n495\n00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:07.898\n&gt;&gt; Trendy is the word you're looking for.\n\n496\n00:26:07.898 --> 00:26:08.790\n&gt;&gt; Trendy, thank you, yes, there you go.\n\n497\n00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:10.067\nI actually have three pictures in here,\n\n498\n00:26:10.067 --> 00:26:12.072\nyou just don't see it because I\njust dropped them all in there.\n\n499\n00:26:12.072 --> 00:26:17.731\nAnd so it can give you different layout\nideas of how you can take your pictures,\n\n500\n00:26:17.731 --> 00:26:21.800\nand they just move them all around and\nit's lovely.\n\n501\n00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:27.430\nBut Design Ideas work really great\nwith default layouts, works great\n\n502\n00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:31.430\nwith images and anything that's there,\nnow here I just kinda free formed and\n\n503\n00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.152\nit's like now I don't know\nwhat to do with this.\n\n504\n00:26:33.152 --> 00:26:34.745\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like I'm not into that modern art.\n\n505\n00:26:34.745 --> 00:26:37.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not because Fuego's\n\n506\n00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:40.890\nin a hat and it's Christmas, it's like\nwhy did you do that to your poor cat?\n\n507\n00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:42.172\n&gt;&gt; Because it's totally po-mo, right.\n\n508\n00:26:42.172 --> 00:26:45.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this slide is a blank layout.\n\n509\n00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:50.150\nThere's no layout applied to it and\nit's just a random shape, a text box, and\n\n510\n00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:51.100\na picture.\n\n511\n00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.321\nSo it's like, I can't give you\nany suggestions on that one.\n\n512\n00:26:54.321 --> 00:26:55.447\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no good way to put\n\n513\n00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:56.262\nthese things together.\n\n514\n00:26:56.262 --> 00:27:00.664\n&gt;&gt; So using the common default layouts,\nputting in some images and\n\n515\n00:27:00.664 --> 00:27:05.475\nusing the stuff that already comes\nwith PowerPoint, and then throw in\n\n516\n00:27:05.475 --> 00:27:10.380\nthose Design Ideas can give you a lot\nof really neat things to work with.\n\n517\n00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.280\n&gt;&gt; I completely agree.\n\n518\n00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:16.080\nI think this is probably the episode that\nreally starts getting into okay, yeah,\n\n519\n00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.170\nwe can put text in,\nwe can manipulate that.\n\n520\n00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:19.814\nYeah, we can throw an image on there,\nwe can manipulate that.\n\n521\n00:27:19.814 --> 00:27:24.254\nBut as we saw, just putting this\nthing together doesn't make it,\n\n522\n00:27:24.254 --> 00:27:26.560\nit's gonna be a good slide.\n\n523\n00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.202\nDoesn't mean it's gonna\ncapture your audience.\n\n524\n00:27:28.202 --> 00:27:31.520\nGetting into the themes, getting into\nthe design, how do I wanna look,\n\n525\n00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.480\nwhat do I wanna emote,\nhow do I wanna move my audience?\n\n526\n00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.430\nThat is where we're really\ntouching on right now.\n\n527\n00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:40.033\nAnd this is where\nPowerPoint really excels.\n\n528\n00:27:40.033 --> 00:27:41.908\n[LAUGH] Not that it uses Excel.\n\n529\n00:27:41.908 --> 00:27:45.110\n[LAUGH] A play on words there,\nyou see what I did?\n\n530\n00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:46.055\nThat's fun stuff.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I heard that,\n\n531\n00:27:46.055 --> 00:27:46.912\nthat was pretty good.\n\n532\n00:27:46.912 --> 00:27:48.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You caught that?\n\n533\n00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.161\nYeah, I try, I try.\n\n534\n00:27:49.161 --> 00:27:52.580\nAll right ladies and gentlemen,\nwe do hope you enjoyed this episode.\n\n535\n00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.580\nBut it does look like we've\ncome to the end, Vonne,\n\n536\n00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.300\nunless you have anything else to add for\nus.\n\n537\n00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.510\n&gt;&gt; No,\nit's just let PowerPoint work for you.\n\n538\n00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.292\nJust put in whatever it tells you to do,\n\n539\n00:28:00.292 --> 00:28:03.754\nclick those designs, and you can have\na beautiful presentation like that.\n\n540\n00:28:03.754 --> 00:28:05.500\n&gt;&gt; Couldn't say it better myself.\n\n541\n00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:06.930\nThank you guys for joining us.\n\n542\n00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.230\nWe do hope you've enjoyed it,\nbut it's time for us to sign off.\n\n543\n00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:12.330\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n544\n00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:13.350\n&gt;&gt;
